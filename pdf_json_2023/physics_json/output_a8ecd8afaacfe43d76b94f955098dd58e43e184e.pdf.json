    "abstractText": "Temperature-sensitive carboxylated cellulose nanocrystals/N-isopropyl acrylamide aerogels (CCNC-NIPAMs) were developed as novel pesticide-controlled release formulas. Ammonium persulfate (APS) one-step oxidation was used to prepare bagasse-based CCNCs, and then the monomer N-isopropyl acrylamide (NIPAM) was successfully introduced and constructed into the temperature-sensitive CCNC-NIPAMs through polymerization. The results of the zeta potential measurement and Fourier infrared transform spectrum (FTIR) show that the average particle size of the CCNCs was 120.9 nm, the average surface potential of the CCNCs was \u221234.8 mV, and the crystallinity was 62.8%. The primary hydroxyl group on the surface of the CCNCs was replaced by the carboxyl group during oxidation. The morphology and structure of CCNC-NIPAMs were characterized via electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), compression performance, porosity analysis, and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis. The results demonstrate that CCNC-NIPAM has a high porosity and low density, as well as good thermal stability, which is conducive to loading and releasing pesticides. In the swelling, drug loading, and controlled release process, the CCNC-NIPAM exhibited significant temperature sensitivity. Under the same NIPAM reaction amount, the equilibrium swelling rate of the CCNC-NIPAM first increased and then decreased with increasing temperature, and the cumulative drug release ratio of the CCNC-NIPAM at 39 \u25e6C was significantly higher than that at 25 \u25e6C. The loading efficiency of the CCNC-NIPAM on the model drug thiamethoxam (TXM) was up to 23 wt%, and the first-order model and Korsmyer\u2013Peppas model could be well-fitted in the drug release curves. The study provides a new method for the effective utilization of biomass and pesticides.",

Bagasse is an important by-product of the sugar industry, and in recent years, the global annual production of bagasse has reached 260 million tons [1]. How to recycle the large amount of cellulose contained in bagasse has become a major research issue for many researchers [2]. Cellulose exists in bagasse in the form of nanoscale microfibers, arranged in larger fiber aggregates and fiber structures [3]. The surface hydroxyl groups and relatively\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4451. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym15224451 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4451 2 of 18\nlarge specific surface area provide abundant active sites for nanocellulose modification [4]. In addition to the advantages of cellulose, carboxylated cellulose nanocrystals (CCNCs) have a higher specific surface area, and their surface carries a negative charge to bind more types of drugs through electrostatic action [5], which provides more possibilities for its application in the field of drug controlled release preparations. The preparation process of CCNCs focuses on reducing the size of cellulose, removing the amorphous region in cellulose as far as possible [6\u20138], and modifying the primary and secondary hydroxyl groups on the surface of cellulose to improve the miscibility and interfacial compatibility of the product CCNCs with solvents and give it new functions [9,10]. The common preparation principle is to directly oxidize the primary hydroxyl group on the surface of the cellulose. After modifying the primary hydroxyl group on the surface of the cellulose with a negative charge, \u2013COOH, the surface of the product CCNCs forms a double-electric-layer structure with a certain thickness in water and achieves stable dispersion in the water phase by electrostatic force. According to the types of oxidants used, the preparation methods can be divided into TEMPO mediation [11,12], ammonium persulfate (APS) oxidation, and potassium permanganate oxidation. Among them, TEMPO oxidation and potassium permanganate oxidation require relatively high original cellulose purity; that is, the use of these two methods to prepare CCNC requires the prior removal of non-cellulose components of raw natural biomass, such as lignin, hemicellulose, and pectin. Complex processing steps and highly toxic chemical agents hinder the use of both methods. APS is a low-toxicity, high-water-solubility, and low-cost oxidizer. The APS oxidation degradation of cellulose is a simple and common one-step method. After persulfate dissolution, free radicals and hydrogen sulfate are generated, which can not only enter and degrade the amorphous region of cellulose but also degrade lignin, thus obtaining CCNCs with a high crystallinity and high oxidation degree. Some researchers have used a variety of biomass raw materials to prepare high-activity CCNCs through APS one-step oxidation and proved that this method is easy to produce on a large scale [13]. To deal with the threat posed by the overuse of pesticides to the environment and human beings, researchers have proposed pesticide controlled release preparations as a solution. Most pesticide active ingredients are hydrophobic organic compounds that require the addition of carriers, solvents, emulsifiers, dispersants, or other auxiliary ingredients to make them easy to use in the field. Thiamethoxam (TXM) belongs to the second generation of nicotinic insecticides, which includes a wide range of insecticidal species that have tactile and gastric toxic effects on pests, high stability, and are easily decomposed. It was used as a model drug in this study. Aerogel is a kind of three-dimensional nanostructured porous material composed of nanoparticles or polymer molecular chains that has the structural characteristics of low density, high porosity, high pore volume, and high specific surface area. Environmentally responsive aerogels can stimulate and respond to changes in the environment such as light, pH, and temperature and are widely used as carriers for drug controlled release preparations [14]. Researchers have developed a variety of temperature-sensitive gels [15,16] whose components contain functional polymers such as N-isopropyl acrylamide (NIPAM) [17], chitosan, and hyaluronic acid [18]. Poly (N-isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPAM) is a polymer composed of the hydrophilic amide group and a hydrophobic isopropyl side chain. It has the characteristics of temperature sensitivity, low toxicity, and easy chemical modification. When the temperature is lower than Lower Critical Solution Temperature (LCST), the amide group in PNIPAM interacts strongly with the water molecules to form a uniform polymer solution. When the temperature is higher than LCST, the interaction between isopropyl side chains in PNIPAM is enhanced, and the force between the amide groups and water molecules is weakened, thus forming a gel. The LCST of PNIPAM is generally 32 \u25e6C, which is close to the temperature of the actual use environment. Moreover, research on the composite gel based on PNIPAM can also improve its biocompatibility, mechanical strength, and drug loading.\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4451 3 of 18\nTo prepare pesticide controlled release preparations with ideal mechanical and drug release properties, the physicochemical properties of the complexes can be improved by adding nano-additives to the polymer skeleton [19]. Due to their good biocompatibility and high specific surface area, CCNCs have been used as a biological material for pesticide delivery [20], which can provide the possibility of high specific drug loading. The negative charge carried on the surface of CCNCs enables them to combine with various watersoluble drugs through electrostatic action. In addition, appropriate chemical or physical modifications to CCNCs can increase the variety of drugs that bind to CCNCs and promote the release of different drugs through different mechanisms. In this study, bagasse was used as a raw material to prepare CCNCs through APS onestep oxidation, and then NIPAM was introduced. Under the action of a crosslinking agent and initiator, a temperature-sensitive nanocellulose aerogel (CCNC-NIPAM) was formed. The morphology and structure of the CCNC-NIPAM were analyzed with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric (TG) analyses, and electron microscopy. A single-factor experiment was designed to adjust the structure and properties of the gel. TXM was used as the model drug to study the performance of the aerogel in the subsequent drug loading and controlled release experiment. In addition, the existing zero-order model, first-order model, Higuchi model, and Peppas model were used to fit the release curves to explore the drug release mechanism."

Figure 1a shows that the yield of CCNCs increased and then decreased with a linear increase in APS solution concentration and oxidation time, and the highest yield was 47.32 wt%. This trend is due to the weak oxidation effect that occurs when the APS concentration is low, which is not enough to completely dissolve the amorphous region. When the concentration is too high, the oxidation degree of the bagasse is too strong, and the oxidation gradually progresses from the non-crystalline zone to the crystalline zone. In addition to oxidizing the hydroxyl group at the C6 position of the molecular chain of the bagasse, it also leads to the breakage of the reductive end of the hydrochloric glucose ring, and a side reaction of oxidation decomposition occurs [21]. Therefore, an excessive increase in the APS concentration and oxidation time will lead to a decrease in CCNC yield. Polymers 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 18\nFigure 1.

The particle size of the CCNCs provided in the software of the measuring instrument is in nanometers, mainly distributed between 60.0 and 180.0 nm, with an average particle size of 120.9 nm. The dispersion and stability of the CCNCs can be evaluated by measuring their potential in deionized water. The zeta potential results show that the average potential of the suspension of CCNCs (0.005 wt%) is \u221234.8 mV [Figure 1d]. At this time, there is a layer of negative charge on the surface of the CCNCs, and an electrostatic repulsion of the same charge makes the CCNC solution maintain a stable and uniform dispersion even if it is applied for a long time (three months) [22]. There are abundant active hydroxyl groups on the surface of nanocellulose without carboxylated modification, and intramolecular hydrogen bonds between groups are easy to form, leading to irregular agglomeration in deionized water. The absolute value of the negative charge on the surface of the product CCNCs increased, and its dispersion increased after the carboxylated nanomodification of the bagasse through the APS one-step oxidation method, providing the conditions for the full participation of CCNCs in the reaction. In addition, in the field of controlled release of pesticides, drug release experiments of controlled release preparations are often conducted in a phosphate buffer (PBS) solution. According to the DLVO theory [23], the stability of the solution is jointly determined by van der Waals force and electrostatic repulsion caused by double electric layers; that is, Na+ and K+ ions in the PBS solution will destroy the thickness of the double electric layer of the negatively charged solute and weaken the repulsion force between ions. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce a carboxyl group on the surface of nanocellulose to reduce the content of the active hydroxyl group. Figure 1e shows the 13C NMR spectra of the CCNCs. The absorbed signals of the samples are mainly at the chemical shift range of \u03b4 = 50~120 ppm, showing a typical cellulose nuclear magnetic signal absorption peak. The absorption signals at the chemical shifts \u03b4 = 68.28, 91.85, and 107.19 ppm correspond to the crystalline regions C6, C4, and C1, while the non-crystalline regions C6 and C4 are located at \u03b4 = 65.48 and 86.76 ppm,\nFigure 1.

In Figure 1b, the oxidati n d gree (DO) of the CCNCs increases linea ly with the concentration and oxidation time of APS until it becomes s able, with the highest DO reaching 90.65%. This was attributed to the ability of APS to ffectively oxidiz and degrade the amo phous regi n of the baga se, selectively replace the prim ry hydroxyl group with the higher surface activity of cellulose, and introduce carboxyl functional groups. The higher the APS concentration, the longer the oxidation ime and the better the oxidation effect.

The particle size test results of the CCNCs (treated with 2 mol/L APS for 24 h) are shown in Figure 1c. The particle size of the CCNCs provided in the software of the measuring instrument is in nanometers, mainly distributed between 60.0 and 180.0 nm, with an average particle size of 120.9 nm. The dispersion and stability of the CCNCs can be evaluated by measuring their potential in deionized water. The zeta potential results show that the average potential of the suspension of CCNCs (0.005 wt%) is \u221234.8 mV [Figure 1d]. At this time, there is a layer of negative charge on the surface of the CCNCs, and an electrostatic repulsion of the same charge makes the CCNC solution maintain a stable and uniform dispersion even if it is applied for a long time (three months) [22]. There are abundant active hydroxyl groups on the surface of nanocellulose without carboxylated modification, and intramolecular hydrogen bonds between groups are easy to form, leading to irregular agglomeration in deionized water. The absolute value of the negative charge on the surface of the product CCNCs increased, and its dispersion increased after the carboxylated nanomodification of the bagasse through the APS one-step oxidation method, providing the conditions for the full participation of CCNCs in the reaction. In addition, in the field of controlled release of pesticides, drug release experiments of controlled release preparations are often conducted in a phosphate buffer (PBS) solution. According to the DLVO theory [23], the stability of the solution is jointly determined by van der Waals force and electrostatic repulsion caused by double electric layers; that is, Na+ and K+ ions in the PBS solution will destroy the thickness of the double electric layer of the negatively charged solute and weaken the repulsion force between ions. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce a carboxyl group on the surface of nanocellulose to reduce the content of the active hydroxyl group. Figure 1e shows the 13C NMR spectra of the CCNCs. The absorbed signals of the samples are mainly at the chemical shift range of \u03b4 = 50~120 ppm, showing a typical cellulose nuclear magnetic signal absorption peak. The absorption signals at the chemical shifts \u03b4 = 68.28, 91.85, and 107.19 ppm correspond to the crystalline regions C6, C4, and C1, while the non-crystalline regions C6 and C4 are located at \u03b4 = 65.48 and 86.76 ppm, respectively. The strong absorption peaks between \u03b4 = 70 and 81 ppm are attributed to C2, C3, and C5, which are not connected to the carbon ring by the glycoside bonds. In addition, the CCNCs showed a peak at the chemical shift \u03b4 = 181.18 ppm, corresponding to the chemical shift of the carbonyl group (C=O). The results indicated that carboxylated nanocellulose was obtained after the oxidative degradation of the CCNCs with persulfuric acid, which was mainly caused by the oxidation of the hydroxyl group on C6 by H2O2 produced by persulfuric acid decomposition in the degradation process."

In Figure 3c, after the APS treatment, the lignin coating and hemicellulose intertwined with cellulose in the bagasse were stripped off, and a small number of new characteristic diffraction peaks appeared in the CCNCs at 34.3\u25e6, which was attributed to the exposure of the (040) surface of the cellulose type I structure [21,25]. The position of the characteristic peaks of cellulose were the same before and after the APS treatment process. However, after the APS treatment, the intensities of the characteristic diffraction peaks of the CCNCs increased by more than 1000 times compared with those before treatment, which was attributed to the disordered and loose molecular arrangement in the amorphous region of the bagasse cellulose. The APS decomposed into hydrogen peroxide and oxygen atoms under heating and acidic conditions and oxidized the reducing groups after entering the amorphous region. The partial hydrogen bond and chemical bond were destroyed, the amorphous region was dissolved, and the diffraction peak in-\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4451 11 of 18\ntensity increased. Before the APS modification, the crystallinity of the bagasse cellulose was low, and the spectrum burr was serious. After the modification, the spectrum of the CCNCs was smooth, which proved the increase in crystallinity. The wide peaks in the XRD results indicate that all the samples have semi-crystalline structures, and the crystallinity calculation results are provided in Table 1. The crystallinity of the bagasse was significant improved after the APS oxidation modification. The results were consistent with those of the SEM analysis Figure 2c.\nFigure 3d proved that the aerogel with different NIPAM reaction quantities had three diffraction peaks at 7.5\u25e6, 20.0\u25e6, and 22.7\u25e6, and the diffraction peaks at 7.5\u25e6 and 22.7\u25e6 belonged to the (101) and (002) crystal planes of the cellulose, respectively. The diffraction peak at 20.0\u25e6 was attributed to a large number of hydrogen bonds in the CCNC-NIPAM due to high hydrophilicity, which was the result of regular internal arrangements [26]. By comparing the XRD patterns of the CCNC-NIPAM and CCNCs, it can be found that the degree of crystallization of the CCNCs was greatly reduced. This is because, under the action of the crosslinking agent, MBA, the polymerization reaction between the CCNCs and the NIPAM monomer and the CCNCs and the NIPAM occurs to form a semi-interpenetrated aerogel network. The combination with NIPAM reduces the formation of hydrogen bonds between the CCNC molecules, destroys the compact structure of the CCNCs, and restricts the crystallization behavior of the CCNCs, resulting in a decrease in crystallinity."

In Figure 3e, the thermal degradations of the CCNCs can be divided into three stages. The weight losses of the CCNCs at 30\u2013100 \u25e6C were ascribed to the evaporation of adsorbed water on the sample\u2019s surface. The CCNC decomposition process mainly occurred at 200\u2013500 \u25e6C. The decomposition rate rapidly increased, and the highest weight loss rate reached its maximum at approximately 300 \u25e6C. With an increase in temperature (>500 \u25e6C), the CCNCs underwent the carbonization process and then decreased in decomposition rate, resulting in a total mass loss of 72.53% at the end of heating. In Figure 3f\u2013h, The decomposition process of CCNC-1NIPAM, CCNC-2NIPAM, and CCNC-3NIPAM can be roughly divided into the following stages: The binding water inside the CCNC-NIPAM was rapidly removed at 30~200 \u25e6C, leading to weight loss. With an increase in temperature, the bulk of the CCNCNIPAM began to decompose rapidly at 200~400 \u25e6C. The decomposition temperatures of the CCNCs were smaller than those of NIPAM, and the decomposition rate of a single CCNC reached its maximum at 300 \u25e6C [Figure 3e], which was attributed to a break in the main chain of the CCNC. When the NIPAM began to decompose, the side chain rupture of the CCNCs and the side chain decomposition of the NIPAM occurred simultaneously. Therefore, the combined decomposition of the CCNCs and NIPAM increased the maximum decomposition rate of the CCNC-NIPAM as compared to those of the CCNCs at approximately 360 \u25e6C, indicating that the NIPAM modification affected the thermal performances of the CCNCs. In the end, the CCNC-NIPAM began to carbonization and then decreased, and its decomposition rate followed a similar pattern.

The three gels shrink sharply within the first 5 min, and then the contraction rate slows down and reaches the contraction equilibrium after around 15 min. The contraction range increases with an increase in the NIPAM fraction. When the temperature is 55 \u00b0C, it is already higher than the volume phase transition temperature of the CCNC-NIPAM. The gel in swelling equilibrium immediately shrinks rapidly, and a shrinkage layer of the polymer chain is formed on the surface of the gel, which inhibits the penetration of solvent from the inside of the gel, and the gel shrinkage\nFigure 5.

Many researchers have proposed that the swelling mechanism of a polymer network is not only the simple diffusion of water molecules but also three continuous processes: water molecule diffusion into the gel network, polymer chain relaxation due to hydration, and gel network expansion in the solution. According to the relationship between the square root of the quantitative\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4451 14 of 18\nmeter SR and the swelling time (t1/2), if the swelling process of the material takes the diffusion of water molecules as the leading step, the SR is proportional to t1/2; otherwise, the relationship curve between SR and t1/2 is S-shaped. According to the calculated results [Figure 5c], the swelling process of each CCNC-NIPAM takes the second and third stages as the control steps. Figure 5b shows the equilibrium swelling rate (ESR) of each aerogel at different temperatures. The results show that the ESR of the CCNC-NIPAM at 25 \u25e6C is higher than that at 39 \u25e6C, which reflects the temperature-sensitive property of the aerogel [31]. The phase transition temperature of the gel can be obtained from the tangential curve of the equilibrium swelling curve of the gel. At this temperature, the slope change of the swelling curve is most obvious; that is, the volume change rate is the largest. To further discuss the thermosensitive characteristics of aerogel, the ESR test of aerogel with temperature as the variable (25~39 \u25e6C) was designed [Figure 5d]. Among them, CCNC-1NIPAM, CCNC-2NIPAM, and CCNC-3NIPAM all showed the largest slope change at 32 \u25e6C, so 32 \u25e6C was taken as the LCST of the CCNC-NIPAM. In the whole temperature range, when the temperature is lower than 32 \u25e6C, the ESR of aerogel gradually increases with increasing temperature. When the temperature is higher than the LCST, the ESR decreases rapidly with increasing temperature. In addition, according to the swelling performance of each aerogel, a rule can be summarized. The higher the NIPAM reaction amount in the raw material, the lower the SR and final ESR in the process. This conclusion can be attributed to the increase in the NIPAM reaction amount, the increase in the aerogel crosslinking degree, the decrease in porosity, and the denser structure. The swelling behavior of the CCNC-NIPAM was hindered [27]. Figure 5e shows the deswelling kinetics curves of the CCNC-NIPAM at 55 \u25e6C after reaching the swelling equilibrium at 25 \u25e6C. The three gels shrink sharply within the first 5 min, and then the contraction rate slows down and reaches the contraction equilibrium after around 15 min. The contraction range increases with an increase in the NIPAM fraction. When the temperature is 55 \u25e6C, it is already higher than the volume phase transition temperature of the CCNC-NIPAM. The gel in swelling equilibrium immediately shrinks rapidly, and a shrinkage layer of the polymer chain is formed on the surface of the gel, which inhibits the penetration of solvent from the inside of the gel, and the gel shrinkage becomes slow. When the pressure gradually accumulates, the solvent inside the gel flows out, and the gel continues to shrink."

Drug Release Behavior Analysis Figure 6a shows the drug release behavior of the CCNC-NIPAM at 25 \u00b0C and 39 \u00b0C.\nFigure 6. Drug release curve of aerogel within 24 h (a) and model fitting example diagram (b).\nAt different temperatures, the cumulative release rate of the TXM-loaded aerogel in the PBS solution gradually increased over time. The initial burst effect of the CCNCNIPAM in Figure 6a was attributed to the fact that part of the drug was absorbed in the pores on the surface of the CCNC-NIPAM during the drug-loading process, where the drug quickly entered the PBS solution through simple diffusion. Moreover, 120 min after the explosive release, the drug release rate of the CCNC-NIPAM decreased, and the TXM dissolved from the carrier substrate and diffused through the three-dimensional network structure in this stage to achieve drug control and continuous release [32]. At 25 \u00b0C, the cumulative release rate of CCNC-1NIPAM within 24 h reached 76.46 wt%, while that of CCNC-3NIPAM was only 40.55 wt%. Also, at 39 \u00b0C, the cumulative release rate of CCNC1NIPAM within 24 h reached 86.10 wt%, while that of CCNC-3NIPAM was only 55.06\nFigure 6.

Also, at 39 \u25e6C, the cumulative release rate of CCNC-1NIPAM within 24 h reached 86.10 wt%, while that of CCNC-3NIPAM was only 55.06 wt%. This is because with an increase in the NIPAM r action amount, t e increase in the number of amino active sites leads to an enhancement of the ability of aerogel to bind to drug molecules, a decrease in the drug molecule release rate, and an extension in the drug molecule release time. In addition, as the amount of NIPAM increased, the network structure of the CCNC-NIPAM densified, and the network structure hindered drug release to a certain extent. In Figure 6a, the drug release behavior of the CCNC-NIPAM temperature-sensitive nanocellulose-based aerogel was also summarized as a function of temperature. The results showed that under the same reaction amount of NIPAM, the drug release rate of the aerogel at 39 \u25e6C was significantly higher than that at 25 \u25e6C, which was attributed to the LCST of the NIPAM being 32 \u25e6C. At 25 \u25e6C (lower than the LCST), the polymer chain of the NIPAM unfolded, but the inherent aerogel structure did not allow the polymer chain to be completely disintegrated, so a hydrophobic environment was formed in the gel, resulting in TXM aggregation, which was not easy to dissolve and diffuse through PBS solution, and the detected drug release rate decreased. When the temperature rose to 39 \u25e6C, the polymer chain of the NIPAM tended to be coiled, and the 3D network contraction of the gel squeezed the internal liquid, and the release rate of TXM increased under the combined action of pressure and concentration difference [29]. The above results proved that the CCNC-NIPAM had good temperature responsiveness, and the controlled release performance of the CCNC-NIPAM could be changed by adjusting its network structure."

The fitting results (Table 4) show that the slow-release kinetic fitting curves are more consistent with the first-order kinetic model and the Korsmeyer\u2013Peppas model, with an R2 greater than 0.9444. In the Korsmeyer\u2013Peppas model, the parameter \u201cn\u201d is\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4451 16 of 18\nan important parameter for the release mechanism. When n is less than 0.45, the release mechanism of the CCNC-NIPAM is Fick diffusion. When 0.45 < n < 0.89, the release mechanism of the CCNC-NIPAM is non-Fick diffusion. When n > 0.89, drug release is mainly due to the erosion of the carrier skeleton. In this study, the fitting parameter, \u201cn\u201d, of aerogel drug release was always less than 0.45, indicating that the drug release in the CCNC-NIPAM was mainly based on the diffusion mechanism."

            "text": "In this study, CCNCs were successfully prepared from bagasse, and the temperaturesensitive monomer NIPAM was introduced to prepare a CCNC-NIPAM, which was applied in the field of pesticide controlled release. The ammonium persulfate one-step oxidation method has the characteristics of using low-purity materials, having a simple operation, and using high-crystallinity products. The average particle size of the prepared CCNCs is 120.9 nm, and the average surface potential of the CCNCs is \u221234.8 mV. The porosity of the CCNC-NIPAM exceeded 85%, with a highly porous structure and rich functional groups. After loading the model drug, TXM, the CCNC-NIPAM became an ideal drug release carrier and showed obvious temperature responsiveness. With the increasing mass ratio of NIPAM to CCNCs, the degree of cross-linking of CCNC-NIPAM increased, which changed the mechanical properties and porosity and also had a certain effect on the swelling behavior, and the cumulative release rate of TXM decreased during the same time. Specifically, at 25 \u25e6C, the cumulative release rate of CCNC-1NIPAM reached 76.46 wt% within 24 h, while that of CCNC-3NIPAM was only 40.55 wt%. At 39 \u25e6C, the cumulative release rate of CCNC-1NIPAM reached 86.10 wt% within 24 h, while that of CCNC-3NIPAM was only 55.06 wt%. The results show that the release kinetic fitting curves are more consistent with the first-order kinetic model and the Korsmeyer\u2013Peppas model. The purpose of this study was to explore a way to make full use of solid waste bagasse and to provide a reference for research on TXM delivery formulas.\nAuthor Contributions: N.D.: formal analysis, investigation, methodology, data curation, writing\u2014 original draft; Z.Q.: resources, writing\u2014review and editing; W.L.: investigation; N.X.: investigation; X.L.: resources, writing\u2014review and editing; H.J.: resources, funding acquisition; Z.W.: resources; X.X.: conceptualization, funding acquisition, project administration, supervision, writing\u2014original draft, writing\u2014review and editing.
