    "abstractText": "Redox-active small molecules containing quinone functional groups play important roles as 8 pharmaceuticals, but can be toxic if overdosed. Despite the need for a fast and quantitative method 9 to detect quinone and its derivatives, current sensing strategies are often slow and struggle to 10 differentiate between structural analogs. Leveraging the discovery that microorganisms use certain 11 quinones to perform extracellular electron transfer (EET), we investigated the use of 12 Lactiplantibacillus plantarum as a whole-cell bioelectronic sensor to selectively sense quinone 13 analogs. By tailoring the native EET pathway in L. plantarum, we enabled quantitative quinone 14 sensing of 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (DHNA) a gut bifidogenic growth stimulator. We 15 found that L. plantarum could respond to environmental DHNA within seconds, producing 16 electronic signals that cover a 106 concentration range. This sensing capacity was robust in 17 different assay media and allowed for continuous monitoring of DHNA concentrations. In a 18 simulated gut environment containing a mixed pool of quinone derivatives, this tailored EET 19 pathway can selectively sense pharmacologically relevant quinone analogs, such as DHNA and 20 menadione, amongst other structurally similar quinone derivatives. We also developed a 21 multivariate model to describe the mechanism behind this selectivity and found a predictable 22 correlation between quinone physiochemical properties and the corresponding electronic signals. 23 Our work presents a new strategy to selectively sense redox-active molecules using whole-cell 24 bioelectronic sensors and opens the possibility of using probiotic L. plantarum for bioelectronic 25 applications in human health. 26",

Despite the need for a fast and quantitative method 9 to detect quinone and its derivatives, current sensing strategies are often slow and struggle to 10 differentiate between structural analogs. Leveraging the discovery that microorganisms use certain 11 quinones to perform extracellular electron transfer (EET), we investigated the use of 12 Lactiplantibacillus plantarum as a whole-cell bioelectronic sensor to selectively sense quinone 13 analogs. By tailoring the native EET pathway in L. plantarum, we enabled quantitative quinone 14 sensing of 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (DHNA) - a gut bifidogenic growth stimulator. We 15 found that L. plantarum could respond to environmental DHNA within seconds, producing 16 electronic signals that cover a 106 concentration range. This sensing capacity was robust in 17 different assay media and allowed for continuous monitoring of DHNA concentrations. In a 18 simulated gut environment containing a mixed pool of quinone derivatives, this tailored EET 19 pathway can selectively sense pharmacologically relevant quinone analogs, such as DHNA and 20 menadione, amongst other structurally similar quinone derivatives. We also developed a 21 multivariate model to describe the mechanism behind this selectivity and found a predictable 22 correlation between quinone physiochemical properties and the corresponding electronic signals. 23 Our work presents a new strategy to selectively sense redox-active molecules using whole-cell 24 bioelectronic sensors and opens the possibility of using probiotic L. plantarum for bioelectronic 25 applications in human health. 26"

To 29 address this problem, we leveraged recent discoveries in electroactive bacteria to develop a novel 30 concept for whole-cell sensing. This concept combines selectivity and specificity, enabling 31 differentiation between analogs based on the temporal dynamic of electron transfer in living cells. 32 With this strategy, we achieved selective detection of pharmacologically relevant quinones with 33 distinct electronic signals for each analog. These signals were deciphered by a multivariate model 34 to provide insight into the specific physiochemical properties of each analog. We envision that this 35 new concept can be applied to other analytes for faster and more efficient sensing using 36 electroactive whole cells. 37\nIntroduction 38\nRedox-active small molecules facilitate interactions between different organisms and their 39 environment. For example, redox-active molecules are tools for interspecies cooperation and 40 competition (1), vehicles for organisms to gain nutrients and conserve energy from their 41 environment (2), and messengers for engineering artificial cell-cell communication (3). A 42 particularly significant set of redox-active small molecules contain the quinone functional group. 43 These molecules, referred to as quinone, play a crucial role in biological energy transduction and 44 have been widely used as pharmaceuticals to combat pathogens, tumors, and to reduce 45 inflammation (4, 5). However, these quinone-derived drugs can cause adverse effects, including 46 toxicity, at high doses or with long-term exposure (5, 6). Additionally, toxic naphthoquinone or 47 benzoquinone derivatives released from industrial products or combustion of fossil fuels have 48 contributed to air, water, and soil pollution, damaging the global ecosystem and posing a threat to 49 human health (7, 8). Therefore, it is essential to accurately detect quinones and monitor their 50 concentrations in order to properly utilize their beneficial properties while minimizing their toxic 51 effects. 52\nExisting strategies for detecting a specific quinone in biological samples typically involve high-53 performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry 54 (LCMS) (9). However, these analytical methods use expensive equipment that requires highly-55 trained operators to perform calibration and sample preparation before any measurement. While 56 electrochemical methods can also be used to detect and characterize quinones, they need to be 57 coupled with analytical chromatography to differentiate quinone analogs (10). Thus, despite their 58 importance, current technologies for selectively detecting a specific quinone in complex biological 59 samples are slow, complex, and require equipment with high capital costs. 60\nAn emerging sensing technology that is fast, uses inexpensive instrumentation, and operates in 61 complex samples is whole-cell bioelectronic sensors. These sensors can couple the presence of a 62 chemical to an electronic response using microbes capable of transferring electrons to an electrode 63 - a multi-step process known as extracellular electron transfer (EET) (11, 12). To create 64 bioelectronic sensors, these microbes have been genetically manipulated to make specific steps in 65 the EET path dependent on the presence of the target analyte using three strategies. The first 66 strategy involves using transcriptional factors regulated by the analyte to conditionally express 67 electron transfer proteins required for EET (13\u201315). While this approach is theoretically applicable 68 to sensing various molecules, including quinones, the detection requires ex-situ analysis which 69 slows the process to a minimum of 30 minutes. The second strategy selectively introduces or 70 deletes an oxidoreductase that both consume the analyte as a substrate and affects the electron flux 71 through the EET pathway. This strategy has been harnessed to sense electron donors (16), terminal 72 electron acceptors (17), or oxyanions involved in assimilatory reduction (18). While this strategy 73 can yield a real-time response, it cannot be applied to quinones since they are not consumed during 74 EET. The third strategy involves engineering a protein in the EET pathway to be allosterically 75 regulated by the analyte of interest. While this strategy has recently been used to sense an 76 endocrine disruptor in real-time (18), it requires a known ligand-binding domain for the analyte of 77\ninterest, which is not available for quinones. Thus, none of these strategies provide a rapid and 78 selective way to sense quinones. 79\nHowever, recent discoveries of the diverse ways EET is carried out in nature provide inspiration 80 for new sensing strategies. Together with Light (19) and Marco (20), we recently discovered a novel 81 EET pathway that is widely found in gram-positive Firmicutes, including a probiotic gut bacterium 82 - Lactiplantibacillus plantarum. This lactic acid bacterium can reduce extracellular electron 83 acceptors such as insoluble iron oxides and an extracellular electrode in the presence of exogenous 84 quinone (20, 21). Here, we develop L. plantarum as a bioelectronic sensor for pharmacologically 85 relevant quinones. We first examined its sensitivity, speed, and dose-dependence in response to 86 DHNA (1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid), a menaquinone precursor that can reduce gut 87 inflammation and stimulate bifidogenic growth in the gut (22\u201324). We then expanded its ability to 88 sense other quinone derivatives and found that L. plantarum can differentiate between different 89 quinone analogs in a mixed quinone pool and generate distinguishable electronic signals. Finally, 90 we tested the quinone bioelectronic sensor in a simulated gut fluid and explored the mechanism 91 behind the quinone selectivity by creating a multivariate model. This work demonstrates a new 92 strategy for rapidly and selectively sensing redox-active molecules and reveals the potential for 93 using L. plantarum as a probiotic exoelectrogen for health-related applications. 94\n95\nResults 96\nA tailored EET pathway in L. plantarum allows signal quantification 97\nIn order to develop L. plantarum as a bioelectronic sensor to sense quinone, it is necessary to 98 ensure that the output electronic signal is directly proportional to the concentration of the quinone 99 being sensed. We have shown previously that Ndh2, a membrane-bound type II NADH 100 dehydrogenase, is required for EET in L. plantarum (20). The addition of exogenous quinones, 101 such as DHNA, trigger Ndh2 to oxidize intracellular NADH and reduce exogenous quinones 102 thereby directly or indirectly (via PplA and/or EetA) transferring electrons from the cytosol to the 103 extracellular electron acceptors (20, 21) (Fig. 1A) . The sequential reaction can be described as 104 below: 105\n\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc3b + \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc34!\" $%&' '\u23af\u23af) \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc37( + \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc34)*% (1) 106\n\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc34)*% + (\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59 \ud835\udc52+ \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f)!\" \u2192 \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc34!\" + (\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59 \ud835\udc52+ \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f))*% (2) 107\nWe hypothesized that, at steady state, the overall EET rate is determined by reaction 1 and follows 108 Michaelis-Menten kinetics (equations 3-5 in Materials and Methods). Therefore, the DHNA 109 concentration is directly linked to EET, demonstrating the possibility to use L. plantarum to 110 quantitatively sense quinone. To experimentally test this working model, it is required that the 111 observed electronic signal is solely driven by Ndh2. However, enzymes that are not essential for 112 EET, including DmkA, an octaprenyltransferase that converts DHNA to dimethylmenaquinone 113 (DMK) (19), and Ndh1, a type II NADH dehydrogenase that has a role in the aerobic-respiration-114\nlike response of L. plantarum (25), also speculated to react with DHNA. These reactions could 115 potentially interfere with DHNA reduction driven by Ndh2 (Fig. 1A). 116\nWe sought to determine if this interference could be eliminated by generating a tailored EET 117 pathway. To do so, we deleted dmkA and ndh1 from L. plantarum NCIMB8826. A mutant with an 118 additional ndh2 deletion served as the control to confirm the role that Ndh2 plays in EET. We 119 compared the EET activity of the mutants by testing their ability to reduce either iron(III) oxide 120 (Fe3+ to Fe2+) or anode (produce current) in the presence of 5 \u03bcM DHNA. The \u0394dmkA\u0394ndh1 strain 121 showed slightly decreased levels of iron reduction and current generation compared with the wild-122 type strain, likely because of branched or secondary EET pathways associated with DmkA or 123 Ndh1. The additional ndh2 knockout significantly disrupted the EET activity (Fig. 1B-C). These 124 results are consistent with our hypothesis that the majority of the electronic signal is driven by 125 Ndh2 whereas DmkA and Ndh1 are dispensable for EET activity. Thus, we used the \u0394dmkA\u0394ndh1 126 mutant strain in the following experiments to test how L. plantarum responds to environmental 127 quinones. 128\nL. plantarum sensitively responds to a wide range of DHNA concentrations following 129 Michaelis-Menten kinetics 130\nTo establish the potential of L. plantarum to serve as bioelectronic sensors for quinones, we sought 131 to first determine the sensitivity, dynamics, and cell-dependence of the EET in response to 132 physiologicolly-relevant concentrations of DHNA. Therapeutically, 5 nM DHNA produced by 133 food-derived propionibacteria can stimulate the growth of bifidobacteria in vitro (22), 0.1 \u03bcM 134 DHNA exhibits anti-inflammatory activity in vitro (23), and 2 mg/kg DHNA inhibits colitis in 135 mice model (23). However, a high concentration of DHNA (50-100 \u03bcM) induces significant 136 cytotoxicity in mouse and human cell lines (24). Under well-controlled laboratory conditions, 137 microbes can synthesize DHNA to even higher concentrations, ranging from 1.8 - 236 \u03bcM (26\u2013138 28). To determine how sensitively L. plantarum responds to environmental DHNA, we incubated 139 the \u0394dmkA\u0394ndh1 strain with varied DHNA concentrations and measured iron reduction levels at 140 several time points over 12 hours. We observed that L. plantarum could react with DHNA over a 141 106 concentration range from 5 nM to 500 \u03bcM (Fig. 2A, 2B), indicating a highly sensitive EET 142 machinery with a large dynamic range. To analyze if EET can quantitatively reflect DHNA 143 concentration following Michaelis-Menten kinetics, we calculated the iron reduction rate per cell 144 over 12 h for each DHNA concentration (Fig. S1). The data could be fitted into the Michaelis-145 Menten equation (Fig. 2C) (equations 4-5 in the Materials and Methods), which confirms our 146 working model. Moreover, the iron reduction rate remained constant over the experimental period, 147 as can be seen from the linear increase in iron reduction levels (Fig. S1), implying that the reaction 148 did not reach equilibrium over 12 h. These data suggest that L. plantarum can serve as a 149 quantitative bioelectronic sensor for DHNA. 150\nThe Michaelis-Menten equation also implies a correlation between Ndh2 concentration and EET 151 rate (equations 4-5 in the Materials and Methods). Since the total amount of Ndh2 in a given culture 152 volume should depend on the number of cells, we sought to explore how cell density affects iron 153 reduction and to determine an optimized cell density that is suitable for sensing. We found that, 154\nfor all the tested DHNA concentrations (0-500 \u03bcM), the iron reduction level at 12 h and the iron 155 reduction rate over 12 h both decreased when the optical density (OD) of cells increased (Fig. 2B, 156 C). This effect could be attributed to the decreased carbon source and electron acceptor available 157 for a single cell caused by the increased cell density in a fixed culture volume, which modulates 158 EET rate at the single cell level. Since OD = 0.25 showed the largest fold change in EET in 159 response to DHNA (Fig. 2B, C), this fixed cell density was chosen for quinone sensing. 160\nTemporal dynamics of EET reflect the concentration of environmental DHNA in real-time 161\nBioelectronic sensors can be created by integrating EET capable cells into bioelectrochemical 162 systems (BESs) - hybrid biological and electrochemical systems that allow continuous monitoring 163 of electronic signals. The response speed of bioelectronic sensors can vary substantially, from 164 minutes (18) to hours (13, 14), depending on the sensing strategy. To investigate how rapidly L. 165 plantarum responds to environmental quinones, we inoculated the \u0394dmkA\u0394ndh1 strain at the OD 166 = 0.25 into the BESs and monitored the temporal dynamics of the electronic signal when 167 physiological concentrations of DHNA (0-5 \u03bcM) were injected. We probed the electronic signal 168 by calculating the difference in current density produced on a per cell basis before and after DHNA 169 injection (\u0394j per cell). As a first test, the nutrient-rich chemically defined media (CDM) was used 170 as the medium to support growth. Immediately upon the injection of DHNA into BESs, we 171 observed a transient current spike (Fig. 3A). This transient spike was due to the abiotic oxidation 172 of DHNA by the electrode, as a similar spike caused by DHNA was also observed in our previous 173 study when heat-killed cells were inoculated (21). Following the spike, the DHNA triggered EET 174 within seconds, and a higher DHNA concentration resulted in a higher current magnitude (Fig. 175 3A, left). The biotic current produced by EET then gradually increased over 24 hours (Fig. 3A, 176 right). We found that the current density per L. plantarum cell could differentiate between DHNA 177 concentrations with 99% confidence (p < 0.01) within 21 seconds, highlighting the real-time 178 response of the DHNA-induced EET (Fig. 3B). To further dissect the temporal dynamics, we used 179 linear regression to calculate the initial rate of current increase within 2 hours (Fig. S2A). The 180 increasing rate is also correlated with DHNA concentration (Fig. S2B). Together, these data 181 suggest that DHNA can dose-dependently activate EET, and the temporal dynamics of current 182 produced by EET reflect DHNA concentrations in real time. 183\nTo test the EET dynamics when cells were in a resting, rather than growing state, we repeated the 184 above experiment in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), which lacks nutrients for protein synthesis 185 and cell proliferation. Again, EET was dose-dependently activated by DHNA within seconds after 186 DHNA injection (Fig. S3A-B). The varied DHNA concentrations could be differentiated with 99% 187 confidence within 36 seconds (Fig. S3C). Interestingly, the biotic current reached a significantly 188 smaller plateau (~5x10-4 vs. ~2x10-2 fA/cm2 per cell) in less time ( ~7.5 h vs. ~24 h) under these 189 resting conditions, suggesting that cell proliferation and/or gene expression increase EET. 190 Nonetheless, these results demonstrate that L. plantarum can sense and respond to DHNA in a 191 dose-dependent manner in both nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor media. 192\nEffective bioelectronic sensors accurately report the concentration of analyte independent of other 193 physicochemical variations in the sample. To rigorously investigate the reliability of DHNA 194\nsensing in different media, we compared the current produced by the L. plantarum \u0394dmkA\u0394ndh1 195 strain in PBS or CDM in response to different concentrations of DHNA, and used adjusted R2 to 196 determine the data similarity. In the course of 24 h post DHNA injection, we found a consistent 197 moderate to high adjusted R2 between these two datasets (Fig. S4), suggesting that the temporal 198 dynamics of current produced by EET could reproducibly reflect DHNA concentrations 199 irrespective of media components. However, the adjusted R2 started to fluctuate over 24 h after 200 reaching the plateau within 5 min (Fig. S4). This suggests that, although data from different media 201 can be aligned, the absolute level of current density (dQ/dt per cm2) for a fixed DHNA 202 concentration is still dependent on whether the cells are in PBS or CDM. As an alternative, we 203 calculated the average current density (\u0394Q/\u0394t per cm2) to focus on the temporal evolution of 204 current change rather than the absolute current level. We observed an improved consistency 205 between the two datasets by using this analysis (Fig. 3C). We conclude that, although the absolute 206 level of current density is suitable for short-term sensing, the average current density is more 207 suitable for long-term monitoring of DHNA. This provides a methodology for data comparison in 208 bioelectronic sensing. 209\nWe next sought to explore if L. plantarum could continuously sense environmental quinone by 210 adding incremental concentrations of DHNA in a stepwise manner with CDM as the assay 211 medium. With every successive addition of a higher concentration of DHNA at a one-hour interval, 212 we observed a steeper current density in response (Fig 3D). The speed of the current increase 213 correlates with the accumulated DHNA concentrations (Fig. S2C). Again, there is a transient 214 current spike induced by DHNA injection starting at 1 \u03bcM DHNA (Fig 3D). The spike magnitude 215 showed no difference between EET and medium control, confirming this signal arises from the 216 abiotic reaction between DHNA and electrode (Fig. S5). Following the spike, the current for 217 medium control gradually went down, indicating the increased current for the \u0394dmkA\u0394ndh1 strain 218 was solely driven by EET (Fig 3D). These results suggest that the L. plantarum can continuously 219 sense DHNA, adjust its EET activity accordingly, and report the DHNA concentration as 220 electronic signals in real-time. 221\nL. plantarum selectively senses pharmacological-relevant quinones in a complex environment 222\nIn the preceding experiments, we have reported on the sensitivity, rapidity, dynamics, 223 reproducibility, and continuity of DHNA sensing by L. plantarum. However, quinones encompass 224 a large group of redox-active aromatic compounds derived from core structural motifs, with 225 DHNA belonging to the class of 1,4-naphthoquinone (1,4-NQ) derivatives. It has been reported 226 that L. plantarum can utilize different 1,4-NQ derivatives to support EET (29). However, the 227 selectivity among these derivatives remains unknown. Therefore, we next investigated if L. 228 plantarum could discriminate specific quinone derivatives from an environmental quinone pool 229 containing diverse structural analogs, and thus, behave as a selective quinone bioelectronic sensor 230 (Fig. 4A). We tested six quinone derivatives (one 1,4-benzoquinone and five 1,4-NQ derivatives) 231 that have pharmacological effects. These derivatives were hydroquinone (depigmenting agent) 232 (30), 1,4-NQ (anti-cancer agent) (31), DHNA (anti-inflammation agent, bifidogenic growth 233 stimulator) (22\u201324), menadione (vitamin K precursor) (32), juglone (herbicide) (33), and DCDMQ 234 (anti-cancer agent) (34). With the assumption that Ndh2 may play a role in quinone recognition, 235\nwe injected the six quinone derivatives individually to either the \u0394dmkA\u0394ndh1 or the 236 \u0394dmkA\u0394ndh1/2 strains and monitored the differential current density produced by these two 237 mutants. Intriguingly, the \u0394dmkA\u0394ndh1 strain produced more current when reacting with DHNA 238 or menadione compared to the \u0394dmkA\u0394ndh1/2 strain, while no difference was observed when 239 reacting with other quinone derivatives (Fig. S6A). This observation indicates that Ndh2 can 240 specifically recognize DHNA and menadione to support EET. 241\nTo test if L. plantarum can selectively sense DHNA and menadione in a continuous way, we 242 injected the six quinone derivatives sequentially into the same batch of cells and monitored the 243 temporal dynamics of current density. When hydroquinone, 1,4-NQ, juglone, or DCDMNQ were 244 sequentially added, the two mutants produced a similar current in response (Fig. 4B). However, 245 when DHNA and menadione were further injected, the \u0394dmkA\u0394ndh1 strain produced more current 246 than the \u0394dmkA\u0394ndh1/2 strain (Fig. 4B). To isolate the signal for Ndh2-dependent EET, we 247 calculated the differential current density by subtracting the current produced by the 248 \u0394dmkA\u0394ndh1/2 strain from that produced by the \u0394dmkA\u0394ndh1 strain (Fig. 4C). The Ndh2-249 independent EET does not significantly affect the differential current density, while the Ndh2-250 dependent EET results in an increased differential current density. Moreover, the injection of 251 menadione resulted in a more rapid increase in the differential current density than DHNA. In this 252 way, DHNA and menadione could be further differentiated (Fig. 4C). This result also implies that 253 sensing the first quinone did not attenuate the ability to sense the second one. Thus, although 254 several quinone structural analogs were present in the same environment, the Ndh2-dependent 255 EET in L. plantarum can continuously and selectively sense EET-supportive quinone derivatives 256 and produce distinguishable signals. 257\nWe further explored if L. plantarum could distinguish DHNA and menadione from the other 258 quinones when they were all injected together. In addition to CDM, we also tested in a fasted state 259 simulated intestinal fluid (FaSSIF) to explore L. plantarum\u2019s sensing ability in a simulated gut 260 environment (35). The inert quinone derivatives (hydroquinone, juglone, DCDMNQ, 1,4-NQ) 261 were added at a lower concentration (0.1 \u03bcM) in FaSSIF than in CDM (1 \u03bcM) to mimic the 262 physiological quinone background in the human gut. To these background media, we then added 263 DHNA, menadione, or both and calculated the differential average current density to neutralize 264 signal fluctuations and analyze the Ndh2-dependent EET (Fig. S7). In both media, we observed 265 the highest differential average current density when DHNA and menadione were added together, 266 followed by menadione and DHNA alone (Fig. 4D). This data demonstrates that DHNA and 267 menadione have an additive effect in activating Ndh2-dependent EET. Thus, L. plantarum can 268 produce distinguishable electronic signals in response to different quinone combinations in a 269 mixed quinone pool. The time needed to differentiate DHNA, menadione, and the mixture with 270 95% confidence was 37.3 min and 1.58 min in CDM and FaSSIF, respectively (Fig. 4E). The 271 longer time needed in CDM is attributed to the transient Ndh2-independent EET induced by the 272 inert quinone derivatives that masked the signals from Ndh2-dependent EET (Fig. S7). In an 273 environment with lower background, such as in FaSSIF, the time needed to differentiate DHNA 274 and menadione is ~20-fold lower. 275\nMechanism of L. plantarum as a selective quinone bioelectronic sensor 276\nBased on all our results, we sought to dissect the fundamental principles of how L. plantarum 277 behaves as a selective bioelectronic sensor. We treated the reaction between quinone and the Ndh2-278 dependent EET pathway as a series of four successive steps: 1) quinone entering the cell 279 membrane, 2) binding to Ndh2, 3) transferring electrons from the co-factor flavin adenine 280 dinucleotide (FAD), 4) semi or hydroquinone leaving Ndh2 and transferring electrons through the 281 rest of the EET pathway (Fig. 5A). We hypothesized that quinones could be selected by L. 282 plantarum for EET through these four steps based on their physiochemical properties (Fig. 5B). 283 These properties include lipophilicity/hydrophilicity, which determines if quinone can freely move 284 in and out of the cell membrane, binding affinity, which determines how tight quinone binds to 285 Ndh2, and redox potential, which determines the tendency to acquire and lose electrons. 286\nTo quantitatively analyze these properties, we determined the following three parameters for each 287 quinone derivative: the calculated partition coefficient (cLogP) (Materials and Methods) (36); the 288 predicted binding free energy between quinone and Ndh2 (Materials and Methods, Fig. 5C, S8) 289 (37); and either the experimentally measured or predicted redox potential (Materials and Methods, 290 Fig. S9, S10). All parameters are shown in Table S1. We then plotted these parameters against the 291 differential average current density induced by each quinone derivative (based on the data shown 292 in Fig. S6A) to analyze the correlations between EET and quinone parameters (Fig. S11). For 293 redox potential, previous work shows that quinones prefer to undergo one electron transfer (1e-) in 294 an aprotic environment (quinone\u21cbsemiquinone, Fig. S9C), such as in the cell membrane, and 295 revealed a correlation between quinone 1e- redox potential and biophotocurrent generated by 296 purple bacteria (38). Indeed, we found a weak correlation between Ndh2-dependent EET and 1e- 297 redox potential (adj R2 = 0.33) (Fig. S11A), while no correlation was observed for 2H+/2e- redox 298 potential (adj R2 = 0.13) (Fig. S11B). However, 1e- redox potential alone fails to explain why 299 juglone, 1,4-NQ, and hydroquinone, which have a lower 1e- redox potential than DHNA, cannot 300 be utilized by EET. For quinone-Ndh2 interaction, we first used AlphaFold to predict the Ndh2 301 structure for L. plantarum (Fig. S8) (39). Then, we used AutoDock Vina to simulate quinone-Ndh2 302 binding (37). We were able to predict a similar quinone binding pocket in the Ndh2 structure of L. 303 plantarum compared to the homologs in other bacteria or yeast (40, 41), demonstrating the 304 reliability of our simulation methods (Fig. 5C). However, no obvious correlation was found 305 between the binding energy and EET (adj R2 = -0.23) (Fig. S11C). For lipophilicity/hydrophilicity, 306 the cLogP value of quinone or semiquinone also fails to correlate with EET (adj R2 = -0.23, -0.24, 307 respectively) (Fig. S11D, E). Thus, we concluded that a single parameter is insufficient to describe 308 the relationship between quinone and Ndh2-dependent EET. This finding is not wholly surprising 309 given that our mechanistic model suggests all of these three parameters would affect EET. 310\nInspired by previous work (38, 42, 43), we performed a multivariate analysis by integrating all 311 parameters. To decrease the variate number, we calculated the differential of cLogP between 312 quinone and semiquinone and treated it as a single variate (cLogPQ-cLogPQ-) (Fig. S12F). We first 313 normalized the current density and all the variates to the unsubstituted 1,4-NQ (i.e., all variates for 314 1,4-NQ=1). Then, multivariate regression was performed and we termed the model output as 315 \u201cquinone score\u201d. We observed a positive correlation between the quinone score and the normalized 316 EET (adj R2 = 0.6) (Fig. 5D), suggesting that the multivariate model is able to interpret the quinone-317\nEET relationship. However, some of the outliers cannot be explained by the model, suggesting 318 that there are still parameters that our model does not cover. For example, 1,4-NQ has a relatively 319 high quinone score but cannot be utilized by Ndh2-dependent EET. 320\nNonetheless, to test the predictive power of our model, we predicted the quinone score for lawsone 321 (2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone) - a natural hair dye present in henna plants with a relatively low 322 1e- redox potential (44, 45). The quinone score for lawsone is higher when compared to the EET-323 negative control but lower than those for DHNA and menadione (Fig. 5E). This score predicts that 324 L. plantarum should be able to use lawsone as an electron shuttle in its Ndh2-dependent EET 325 pathway, but will generate a lower current compared to DHNA or menadione. Indeed, when 326 lawsone was supplied, the \u0394dmkA\u0394ndh1 strain produced more current than the \u0394dmkA\u0394ndh1/2 327 strain (Fig. S6B). When comparing the differential average current densities, the magnitude is 328 higher for lawsone than that for hydroquinone (negative control) but lower than those for DHNA 329 or menadione (Fig. 5F), which is in agreement with the prediction. Thus, our multivariate model 330 could identify new quinone derivatives that can be sensed by Ndh2-dependent EET. Using this 331 model, the electronic signals produced by L. plantarum can be decoded to distinguish between 332 quinone structural analogs. 333\nDiscussion 334\nHere we investigated the potential of L. plantarum to serve as a bioelectronic sensor for quinones. 335 Using a genome-modified L. plantarum strain, we demonstrated its ability to sensitively, rapidly, 336 and continuously sense varying concentrations of DHNA in both nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor 337 media following Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics. Further analysis revealed that the Ndh2-dependent 338 EET in L. plantarum could selectively sense menadione, DHNA, and lawsone amongst other 339 quinone structural analogs, and we created a multivariate model to explain this selectivity. 340\nOur multivariate model reveals general principles underlying L. plantarum's ability to selectively 341 sense quinones. The model suggests that Ndh2-dependent EET mainly discriminates based on 1e- 342 redox potential of quinones, followed by its binding affinity to Ndh2, and least on its lipophilicity 343 or hydrophilicity (Fig 5D). The positive and negative coefficients of the multivariate equation also 344 imply that, in general, quinones with a higher tendency to lose electrons (lower 1e- redox potential), 345 higher binding affinity to Ndh2, and a smaller differential in lipophilicity/hydrophilicity (so that 346 can easily move in and out the cell membrane) are more likely to be utilized by L. plantarum for 347 EET. Compared to other models that examine the structure-function relationships between 348 mediator and EET (38, 43), our model considers the biological interaction between quinone and a 349 specific reductase (Ndh2) in addition to the quinone\u2019s physiochemical properties. However, our 350 model is limited by being based on a relatively small set of 1,4-naphthoquinones with similar 351 physio-chemical properties. Thus, while this model has a degree of predictive power, future work 352 is needed to refine and validate the model with a larger pool of quinone derivatives. 353\nOur study reveals a new whole-cell bioelectronic sensor chassis - L. plantarum, and a strategy to 354 sense a new class of analytes - quinones. State-of-the-art whole-cell bioelectronic sensors rely on 355 Shewanella oneidensis (13\u201315), Geobacter sulfurreducens (17), or lab-engineered Escherichia 356 coli (18), and are limited in their applications to environmental sensing. By demonstrating that L. 357\nplantarum, a probiotic gut microbe, can sense quinones in a simulated intestinal fluid (Fig. 4C), 358 our study expands the potential applications of bioelectronic sensors to include sensing within 359 mammalian hosts. Moreover, we characterized quinones as a new class of redox analytes that can 360 be sensed by exoelectrogens to produce amperometric signals. Several prior studies have used 361 redox-active molecules, such as flavins (46, 47) and phenazines (48), as signal carriers. However, 362 most of them rely on voltammetric approaches where the signal generated by other redox 363 molecules present in the medium often overlaps with the signal generated by the analytes. In 364 contrast, L. plantarum\u2019s sensing of quinone through a biologically selective EET route allows for 365 more accurate sensing. Since quinone is recycled by EET, there is no change in the environment 366 during the process of sensing. This is in contrast to other EET-based bioelectronic sensors that 367 consume donors/acceptors or oxyanions during the sensing process (16\u201318). The recycling of 368 quinone also amplifies the signals, making the limited detection concentration of our bioelectronic 369 sensor (0.005 \u00b5M for DHNA) 200-fold lower than HPLC (1 \u00b5M for DHNA) (49). 370\nOur work also demonstrates a new concept for improving analyte selectivity in whole cells. Whole-371 cell biosensors offer advantages such as long-term operation and the ability to function in complex 372 environments, but many of them depend on analyte-specific transcriptional factors. This can be 373 problematic when dealing with structural analogs, as many transcriptional factors must be created 374 to detect each individual analyte (50). In contrast to specific sensing, selective sensing can be 375 achieved through the use of nonspecific sensing elements, such as nanoparticles, quantum dots, 376 peptides, or nonspecific transcriptional factors, to simultaneously detect a class of analytes (51\u2013377 53). However, these sensors must be carefully arranged in a complex array to generate unique 378 \u201cfingerprints\u201d to identify individual components (51\u201353). Our quinone bioelectronic sensor 379 represents a new type of whole-cell biosensor that offers both selectivity and specificity. It 380 selectively detects a class of 1,4-naphthoquinones and specifically discriminates between 381 structural analogs, such as menadione and DHNA, based on the temporal dynamics of the 382 electronic output signal (Fig 4A). This difference in output signal is a result of the differing kinetics 383 of Ndh2-dependent reduction of these analogs, which can be described using a multivariate model 384 (Fig 5D). Nonetheless, one question that remains from this work is how to interpret the electronic 385 signals to inform each component when multiple unknown quinones are present in a mixed pool. 386 This can be potentially addressed by building a machine learning model to precisely identify 387 individual components (52, 53). 388\nMoreover, the quinone bioelectronic sensor in this study leverages the native Ndh2 of L. plantarum 389 and shows a preference for sensing 1,4-naphthoquinones (Fig. 4B, S6), whereas Ndh2 homologs 390 in other organisms show broader binding to ubiquinones or menaquinones (40, 41). It is possible 391 to use protein evolution to modify Ndh2 of L. plantarum to sense other types of quinone 392 derivatives, such as quinone-derived cancer drugs or air pollutants, for rapid drug monitoring and 393 pollution control. Hence, this work opens the possibility of using L. plantarum as a probiotic 394 chassis for EET-based bioelectronic applications in the fields of environment, food, and medicine. 395\n396\nMaterials and methods 397\nStrains and culture conditions 398\nAll strains used in this study are listed in Table S4. Escherichia coli 10-beta (New England 399 Biolabs) was used for plasmid construction. Lactiplantibacillus plantarum NCIMB8826 was used 400 as the parental strain for all the experiments. L. plantarum strains were grown in commercial MRS 401 (HiMedia) from glycerol stocks at 37 \u00b0C without shaking. To grow a large volume of L. plantarum 402 for a subsequent iron reduction assay or a bioelectrochemical assay, cells were subcultured in 403 modified MRS containing 1% (w/v) mannitol and grown at 37 \u00b0C without shaking (20, 54). In 404 bioelectrochemical systems, Chemically Defined Medium (CDM) containing 1% (w/v) mannitol 405 (Table S2) was used as the culture medium for L. plantarum. For testing in a bio-relevant 406 environment, the Fasted State Simulated Intestinal Fluid (FaSSIF, Biorelevant, UK) was prepared 407 as indicated in Table S3. For both iron reduction and bioelectrochemical assays, cells were tested 408 at 30 \u00b0C under anaerobic conditions. 409\nL. plantarum mutant construction 410\nL. plantarum SL046 (\u0394dmkA\u0394ndh1) and SL052 (\u0394dmkA\u0394ndh1\u0394ndh2) strains were constructed 411 by using the CRISPR-Cas9 toolbox developed by Huang et al. (55). The crRNAs targeting each 412 gene were designed by using CRISPOR (http://crispor.tefor.net/). The sgRNA fragment and the 413 homologous arms flanking each gene were cloned into the ApaI-XbaI digested pHSP02 backbone 414 by Gibson assembly to create the editing plasmids pSTS04, pSL47, pSL51 that target dmkA, ndh1, 415 ndh2, respectively (primers and oligos are listed in Table S6). For CRISPR editing, L. plantarum 416 NCIMB8826 strain harboring helper plasmid pLH01 was induced with 100 ng/ml Sakain P peptide 417 (GenScript) for RecE/T expression and was subsequently prepared as competent cells. The editing 418 plasmid was then delivered into L. plantarum by electroporation. The transformed cells were 419 spread on MRS plates containing 10 \u03bcg/mL erythromycin and 10 \u03bcg/mL chloramphenicol to 420 screen for the deletion mutants. We found that the edited L. plantarum mutant does not retain the 421 helper plasmid pLH01 and cannot grow with antibiotic selection in liquid MRS culture. Thus, for 422 sequential editing, we inoculated the L. plantarum mutant in antibiotics-free MRS for two passages 423 and screened for the colonies with both the helper plasmid and the editing plasmid being cured. 424 Then, we electroporated the helper plasmid back to the mutant strain for the next round of gene 425 deletion. 426\nMichaelis-Menten kinetics 427\nWe hypothesized that DHNA reduction by Ndh2 follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics when the 428 intracellular NADH is sufficient to support EET. DHNA oxidation by terminal electron acceptor 429 can be either direct or indirect (involving intermediate steps via PplA and/or EetA) (21). When an 430 insoluble terminal electron acceptor is used (such as metal iron or electrode), and the DHNA 431 oxidation is fast enough, this step can be treated as a pseudo-first-order reaction. Under this 432 assumption, the apparent EET rate (VEET, the rate that terminal electron acceptors are reduced) is 433 equal to DHNA oxidation rate following first-order kinetics. At the quasi-steady-state, the 434 concentration of reduced DHNA does not change. This means DHNA reduction rate is equal to 435 DHNA oxidation rate: 436\n\ud835\udc49,-\" [/0$1!\"]\n[/0$1!\"] ( 3# = \ud835\udf06[\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc51] = \ud835\udc49445 (3) 437\nthus, \ud835\udc49445 = \ud835\udc49,-\" [/0$1!\"]\n[/0$1!\"] ( 3# = \ud835\udc586-7[\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc51\u210e2] [/0$1!\"] [/0$1!\"] ( 3# (4) 438\nwhere \u03bb is the first-order rate constant, Vmax is the maximum DHNA reduction rate, Km is the 439 Michaelis constant, kcat is the turnover number of Ndh2. This implies that the apparent EET rate 440 (VEET) is a Michaelis-Menten function of oxidized DHNA concentration. Because it is unpractical 441 to measure the concentration of oxidized DHNA at steady-state, we assume [DHNAox] \u226b 442 [DHNAred] when DHNA oxidation is fast enough and treat the total DHNA concentration 443 [DHNAtotal] as an approximation of the oxidized DHNA concentration: 444\n\ud835\udc49445 = \ud835\udc586-7[\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc51\u210e2] [/0$1!\"]\n[/0$1!\"] ( 3# \u2248 \ud835\udc586-7[\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc51\u210e2] [/0$1$!$%&] [/0$1$!$%&] ( 3# (5) 445\nTherefore, we used equation 5 to fit the experimental data into Michaelis-Menten equation. All 446 data fitting and analysis were performed in either OriginLab or MATLAB. 447\nIron reduction assay 448\nAfter overnight growth, cells were harvested at 4000 rpm, 4 \u00b0C, for 15 min. Cells were washed 449 twice with 1x PBS and resuspended in 1x PBS to OD600=4. CFU was then measured by dilution 450 plating. In an anaerobic chamber (Whitley A45 anaerobic workstation), the concentrated cells were 451 inoculated in a 96-deep well plate (cells were series diluted if necessary) and mixed in a 1:1 ratio 452 with a 2x iron master mixture prepared in PBS. The final composition of the reaction mixture was: 453 2 mM iron(III) oxide nanoparticles (< 50 nm, Sigma-Aldrich), 2 mM ferrozine, 1% (m/v) mannitol, 454 indicated concentration of DHNA, and indicated cell OD600. After incubating at 30 \u00b0C for indicated 455 hours, a 150 \u03bcl aliquot of the reaction mixture was harvested, and 100 \u03bcl supernatant was collected 456 after centrifuging at 4000 rpm for 10 min. The absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 562 457 nm by a plate reader (Tecan Spark). The concentration of Fe2+ in each sample was calculated by a 458 standard curve prepared with FeSO4 (0-0.4 mM, 2-fold increase) and was normalized to CFU. The 459 scanned image showing the color range was taken by a desktop scanner in a 96-well white bottom 460 plate. 461\nBioelectrochemical system construction 462\nWe used water-jacketed dual-chamber bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) (Adams & Chittenden 463 Scientific Glass) and a VMP-300 potentiostat (BioLogic) for all the bioelectrochemical 464 measurements. The anodic chamber of the BES contained an Ag/AgCl reference electrode filled 465 with 3M KCl (CH111, CH Instruments) and a 6.35-mm-thick graphite felt working electrode with 466 a 16-mm radius size (Alfa Aesar) threaded to a 0.5-mm radius titanium wire (Alfa Aesar). The 467 cathodic chamber contained a titanium wire as the counter electrode. The anodic chamber was 468 separated from the cathodic chamber by using a cation membrane (CMI-7000, Membranes 469 International). 470\nThe BESs were filled with ddH2O and sterilized by autoclaving. The media in the anodic chamber 471 was then replaced by 110 ml 1x CDM or PBS containing 1% mannitol. The media in the cathodic 472\nchamber was replaced by 1x M9 salts (BD Difico). A magnetic stir bar was placed in the anodic 473 chamber for continuous stirring at 220 rpm (IKA RO10 Magnetic Stirrers). N2 gas was purged 474 continuously into the anodic chamber to maintain anaerobic conditions. The BESs were kept at 475 30 \u2103 by connecting the water-jackets to an ECO ES4 heating circulator (Lauda-Brinkmann). To 476 carry out bioelectrochemical measurements, the working electrode was poised at +0.2 V versus 477 Ag/AgCl and chronoamperometry was carried out to record the current every 36 s. Once the 478 current stabilized, the cells were inoculated for the subsequent bioelectrochemical analysis. 479\nBioelectrochemical assay with quinone addition 480\nOvernight cultures of L. plantarum were harvested at 4000 rpm, 4 \u2103, for 15 min. Cells were 481 washed twice and resuspended in 1x PBS to OD600 = 9.16 per ml. A 3 ml aliquot of the cell 482 resuspension was injected into the BESs so that the final OD600 = 0.25 per ml. To measure CFU, 483 a 200 \u03bcl aliquot of sample was taken from each BESs after cells were homogeneously stirred. The 484 CFU was then determined by dilution plating. The quinone of interest was injected after the current 485 had stabilized. 486\nDHNA, hydroquinone, 1,4-naphthoquinone, juglone, DCDMNQ, menadione, and lawsone 487 (Sigma-Aldrich) were prepared freshly in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). A 200 \u03bcl aliquot of 488 a 550x stock quinone solution with varied concentrations was then injected into the BESs 489 containing 110 ml medium for the desired final concentration (1x). The current was recorded every 490 1s to monitor the transient current change upon quinone addition. 491\nRedox potential measurement or prediction 492\nCyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement of quinone 1e- or 2e-/2H+ redox potential was conducted 493 in a single chamber electrochemical cell with a glassy carbon working electrode and a Pt mesh 494 counter electrode. All solutions were sparged with N2 prior to the measurement and N2 was 495 continuously blown over the solution during the CV scan to maintain an anaerobic condition. The 496 2e-/2H+ redox potential was measured in 100 mM MOPS buffer containing 100 \u03bcM quinone of 497 interest. CV was performed v.s. Saturated Calomel Electrode (SCE) reference electrode at a scan 498 rate of 50 mV/s. The 1e- redox potential was measured in acetonitrile containing 0.1 M 499 tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) as the electrolyte (56). Each quinone of 500 interest was tested at 10 mM. Ag/Ag+ was used as the reference electrode. Ferrocene of 5 mM was 501 added as the internal standard. CV was performed at a scan rate of 50 mV/s. 502\nThe 1e- redox potential for DHNA was not experimentally accessible due to the lack of purified 503 oxidized DHNA. We adapted and modified the method reported by Prince et al. to correlate the 504 Hammett \u03c3para constants with 1e- redox potentials (45). We then used the trend line to predict the 505 1e- redox potential for DHNA (see Fig. S11). 506\nQuinone-Ndh2 binding simulation 507\nThe three-dimensional structure of Ndh2 from L. plantarum was predicted by AlphaFold (39). The 508 truncated 1-409 aa region was used for molecular docking (Fig. S9). Quinone-Ndh2 docking was 509 performed by using AutoDock Vina (37) with the searching exhaustiveness of 9 and the energy 510\nrange of 24 (kcal/mol). The grid box size was set to 24\u00c5 \u00d7 34\u00c5 \u00d7 10\u00c5 and centered at position 511 (8.885, -7.046, 6.636) in the coordinate space of the receptor. This space is demonstrated to be the 512 quinone binding pocket according to previous studies (40, 41). The model with the highest binding 513 energy and a proper posing of quinone in the binding pocket was chosen for further analysis. 514\ncLogP determination 515\nThe cLogP value for quinone or semiquinone was calculated by using ChemDraw 21.0.0. 516\n517\nAcknowledgments 518\nWe thank Dr. Jayashree Soman (Rice University) for helping predict the Ndh2 structure and 519 reviewing the manuscripts; Prof. Emily Mevers (Virginia Tech) for discussing the quinone-EET 520 relationship; Prof. Maria Marco, Dr. Eric Stevens (University of California, Davis), and Dr. Sara 521 Tejedor-Sanz (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) for helpful conversations; Prof. Shannon 522 Stahl and Dr. James Gerken (University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison) for the protocol of measuring 523 quinone 1e- redox potential.

Time-course iron reduction and calculation of the initial iron reduction rate. (A-D) 795 Concentration of Fe2+ produced by 0.25, 0.5, 1, or 2 OD of cells was measured at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 796 h after cells were mixed with iron(III) oxide and different concentrations of DHNA. To calculate 797 the initial iron reduction rate, data of 0 h and 2 h were omitted for all DHNA concentrations and 798 for all cell densities to improve the accuracy of linear regression. This is because the Fe2+ 799 concentrations were below the detection threshold at these two time points.

The current spike upon DHNA addition results from abiotic DHNA oxidation. The 879 amplitude of the current spike upon DHNA injection was calculated for the \u0394dmkA\u0394ndh1 mutant 880 and the medium control. The spike current density was plotted against DHNA concentrations. No 881 difference was observed between these two groups.

Prediction of the 1 e- redox potential of DHNA. (A) Summary of Hammett \u03c3para 948 constants for each 2-substitutions of 1,4-naphthoquinone and the 1e- redox potentials for each 949 derivatives. The 1e- redox potential for 1,4-naphthoquinone (2-H) and menadione (2-methyl) were 950 measured in this paper (Fig. S9). The 1e- redox potentials for other derivatives were reported by 951 Prince et al. and were converted to compare with our measurements by a factor of -0.5 V. The 952 Hammett \u03c3para constants were then plotted against 1e- redox potentials and the 1e- redox potential 953 of DHNA (2-carboxyl) was predicted by using the fitted equation. (B) Hammett \u03c3para constants 954 plotted against 1e- redox potential of 2-substituted 1,4-naphthoquinones showing a linear 955 relationship between these two parameters. 956\n957\n958\n959\n960\n961\n962\n963\n964\nFig S11.
