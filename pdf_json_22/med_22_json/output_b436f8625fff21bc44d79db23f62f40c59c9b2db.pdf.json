    "abstractText": "The nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to have a high ability of liquid-liquid phase separation, which enables its incorporation into stress granules (SGs) of host cells. However, whether SG invasion by N protein occurs in the scenario of SARSCoV-2 infection is unknow, neither do we know its consequence. Here, we used SARS-CoV-2 to infect mammalian cells and observed the incorporation of N protein into SGs, which resulted in markedly impaired self-disassembly but stimulated cell cellular clearance of SGs. NMR experiments further showed that N protein binds to the SG-related amyloid proteins via non-specific transient interactions, which not only expedites the phase transition of these proteins to aberrant amyloid aggregation in vitro, but also promotes the aggregation of FUS with ALS-associated P525L mutation in cells. In addition, we found that ACE2 is not necessary for the infection of SARS-CoV-2 to mammalian cells. Our work indicates that SARS-CoV-2 infection can impair the disassembly of host SGs and promote the aggregation of SG-related amyloid proteins, which may lead to an increased risk of neurodegeneration.",

            "text": "The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an international public health emergency. SARS-CoV-2 infection typically causes a contagious respiratory tract illness and occasionally gastrointestinal symptoms (Lee et al., 2020; Mao et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). These immediate symptoms would disappear in several weeks as the patients recover from the infection (Soresina et al., 2020; Thevarajan et al., 2020). In the meantime, many evidence have shown that SARS-CoV-2 can also infect human central nervous system (Mao et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020; Song et al., 2021) and cause neuroinflammation (Bostanciklioglu, 2020; Gatto and Fernandez Boccazzi, 2020; Hascup and Hascup, 2020; Heneka et al., 2020; Singal et al., 2020), which raise worries about potential long-term effects of COVID-19 especially on the development of neurodegenerative diseases (Gatto and Fernandez Boccazzi, 2020; Heneka et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Paniz-Mondolfi et al., 2020; SerranoCastro et al., 2020). Indeed, virus invasion in neurological system has been linked to the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Jang et al., 2009; Eimer et al., 2018; Readhead et al., 2018; Bellmann et al., 2019; Marreiros et al., 2020). PD diagnosed after SARS-CoV-2 infection has been also reported (Cohen et al., 2020). However, the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and neurodegeneration requires a lot more evidence to reveal.\nSARS-CoV-2 belonging to SARS-related coronaviruses, is an enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus with a 30-kb genome (Wu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). Its genomic RNA packages with the nucleocapsid (N) protein to form the so-called nucleocapsid (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997; Saikatendu et al., 2007), which is important for the viral replication and transcription (McBride et al., 2014). The genome of SARS-CoV-2 consists of 14 open reading frames (Orfs) encoding 16 non-structural proteins (Nsp1\u201316), four structural proteins (spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N)) and nine putative accessory factors (Chan et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020). A recent mass spectrometry study expressed 26 out of the 29 SARS-CoV-2 proteins in human cells and identified broad interactions between the viral and human proteins involved in biological processes including protein trafficking, translation, transcription and ubiquitination regulation (Gordon et al., 2020). Bioinformatics analysis predicted that the disordered domains of SARS-CoV-2 N protein can engage in \u03c0\u03c0 intermolecular interactions with host stress granule (SG) proteins, which is crucial for the viral hijacking of host machineries (Moosa and Banerjee, 2020). Recombinant N protein of SARS-CoV-2 exhibits a high ability of liquid-liquid phase separation in vitro (Carlson et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020; Iserman et al., 2020; Savastano et al., 2020; Luo et al.,\n2021b; Zhao et al., 2021), overexpression of which in human cell lines showed its incorporation into SGs (Savastano et al., 2020; Luo et al., 2021a). These studies indicate the association of N protein with host SGs, while a real scenario of virus infection is lacking. Neither do we know the consequence of the potential invasion of host SGs by SARS-CoV2.\nIn this work, we infected mammalian cells with SARSCoV-2, and observed that N protein but not the other monitored viral proteins incorporated into host SGs. Consequently, the invaded SGs are less dynamic and resistant to disassemble after the removal of stress, but are promoted for clearance upon continuous stress. In vitro observations showed cooperative liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of N protein with SG-related amyloid proteins and stimulation of their amyloid aggregation. NMR experiments further characterized the non-specific transient interactions between N protein and SG-related amyloid proteins. The enhancement of amyloid aggregation by SARS-CoV-2 infection was further shown by the exacerbated aggregation of an ALS-associated FUS mutant in cells. In addition, we found that cells without the ACE2 receptor can still be infected by SARSCoV-2, with a decreased efficiency though. These molecular evidences support that SARS-CoV-2 infection might increase the risk of neurodegenerative diseases."

Vero cells have the ACE2 receptor (Fig. S1A), which can help the entry of SARS-CoV-2 (Li et al., 2003). After two days for virus replication, expression of viral proteins in Vero cells was detected (Fig. S1A). Although HeLa cells lack ACE2 (Zhou et al., 2020), at a high multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.75, SARS-CoV-2 can still infect HeLa cells and the expression of the viral N protein was detected by Western blot (Fig. S1B). However, the expression of Spike was not observed (Fig. S1B), which may reflect poor replication of the virus in HeLa cells. To increase the virus entry efficiency, we also treated HeLa cells overexpressing human ACE2 (ACE2-HeLa cells) with the virus. After 2 days for viral replication, expression of the viral proteins was detected (Fig. S1B). These results indicate that ACE2 is not necessary for SARS-CoV-2 to infect mammalian cells, although it can increase the efficiency."

The result showed that N protein but not the others is recruited into the SGs of the mammalian cells (Figs. 1B and S2).\nIt has been reported that overexpressed N protein of either SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV can invade cellular SGs (Peng et al., 2008; Savastano et al., 2020; Luo et al., 2021a). We confirmed this result by overexpressing recombinant Flag-tagged N protein in HeLa cells, and consistently observed the overexpressed N protein co-localizing with SGs (Fig. 1C). The overexpression results indicate that N protein can incorporate into SGs independent of viral components.\nSARS-CoV-2 infection impairs the self-disassembly of SGs\nTo investigate the influence of SARS-CoV-2 invasion on SG dynamics, we relieved the cellular stress by washing out sodium arsenite in the culture medium (Fig. 2A). Before washout, similar amounts of SGs formed in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and control cells (not treated with virus) (Fig. 2B), indicating no significant influence of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the assembly of SGs. However, the self-disassembly of SGs was significantly slowed down in the infected cells monitored 60 min post washout (Fig. 2B). Similar phenomena were observed in both HeLa cells and ACE2overexpressed HeLa cells (Figs. 2B and S3A). We also performed the washout experiment by directly overexpressing N protein in HeLa cells and obtained consistent results with that infected by the virus (Fig. S3B).

Notably, SARSCoV-2 infected cells exhibited more severe SG disappearance than the control cells (Fig. 2D). Similar phenomena were observed when overexpressing N protein in HeLa cells (Fig. S4). These results indicate that abnormal SGs due to the incorporation of the viral N protein may be more potent to trigger cellular degradation systems."

            "text": "It has been reported that N protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a high ability of LLPS under various conditions (Carlson et al., 2020; Cubuk et al., 2020; Iserman et al., 2020; Luo et al., 2020; Perdikari et al., 2020; Savastano et al., 2020). The LLPS property of N protein has been suggested to play an important role in the viral genome packing in other viruses (Guseva et al., 2020; Monette et al., 2020). We also observed that N protein readily underwent LLPS in the presence of synthetic single-stranded RNA (polyU) (Fig. S5).\nSeveral RNA-binding proteins of SGs including FUS, hnRNPA1, and TDP43 are meanwhile prone to undergo amyloid aggregation, which is closely associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). These proteins also have a high ability of LLPS (Molliex et al., 2015; Patel et al., 2015). To investigate the influence of SARS-CoV-2 N protein on the phase transition of these SG-related amyloid proteins, we added the viral N protein to the LLPS solution of human FUS, hnRNPA1, and TDP43, respectively. Fluorescent microscopic imaging showed that N protein spontaneously condenses in the droplets formed by the SG proteins (Fig. 3A), which is consistent with a previous report showing that N protein can co-phase separate with FUS, TDP43, and hnRNPA2 (Perdikari et al., 2020).\nMoreover, we observed that in the presence of N protein, the fluorescent intensity of EGFP-tagged FUS (FUS-EGFP) recovered markedly slower than that in the absence of N protein (Fig. 3B). After incubation for 12 h, the shape of the droplets was apparently less round than that at 0 h (Fig. 3B). FRAP showed that these droplets nearly lost the mobility and were hardly recovered after bleaching (Fig. 3B). Similarly, N protein also impairs the liquid-like nature of the hnRNPA1 and TDP43 droplets by FRAP experiments (Fig. S6). These data indicate that the involvement of N protein accelerates the liquid-to-solid maturation process of these SG proteins, which is in line with the impaired dynamics of SGs in cells stated above.\nNon-specific transient interactions between N protein and the LC domains of SG-related proteins\nWe next used NMR spectroscopy to study the molecular mechanism underlying the interaction between N protein and the SG proteins. The 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectra of 15N-labeled FUS low complex domain (FUS-LC) and 15N-labeled TDP43-LC showed that both proteins adopted an intrinsically disordered conformation with a narrow chemical shift dispersion in the 1H dimension (backbone amide resonances within 7.8\u20138.8 ppm) (Fig. S7), which is consistent with the previous reports (Burke et al., 2015; Conicella et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2020; Gu et al., 2021a). We then used unlabeled N protein to titrate 15N-labeled FUS-LC. The HSQC spectra of FUS-LC showed a global decrease of signal intensities in a concentration-dependent manner (Figs. 4A, 4B and S7B), indicating direct interaction between N protein and FUS-LC. However, no specific region or residue type showed significant intensity decrease compared to others, and residues of FUS-LC suffered an overall \u223c40% intensity decrease at the substoichiometric molar ration of 1:0.5 (FUS-LC:N) (Fig. 4A), implying that the interaction between N protein and FUS-LC is non-specific. Similarly, titration of N protein to TDP43-LC resulted in concentration-dependent attenuations of the signal intensities in the HSQC spectra of TDP43-LC (Figs. 4C, 4D and S7D). The interaction between N protein and TDP43-LC also appears non-specific, since the residues of TDP43-LC generally showed a \u223c20% intensity decrease at the molar ratio of 1:5 (TDP43-LC:N) (Figs. 4C, 4D and S7D). Unfortunately, we did not get a good NMR spectrum of hnRNPA1-LC, in which only a few broadening crosspeaks could be detected at our conditions. Taken together, these results indicate that N protein may commonly bind the SG proteins via nonspecific weak interactions to the LC domains of the SG proteins."

TEM imaging confirmed amyloid fibril formation in these samples (Fig. 5B). In addition, we confirmed that N protein under the examined conditions does not form amyloid fibrils (Fig. S8). These results indicate that N protein can generally stimulate the phase transition of the SG-related amyloid proteins into amyloid aggregation.\nFigure 4.

Next, we treated the cells with SARS-CoV-2 and observed that the viral N protein colocalizes with FUS P525L aggregates (Fig. 5C). Notably, comparing with the control cells (no virus infection), the aggregation of FUS P525L significantly increased upon virus infection (Fig. 5C). We also observed the same enhancement of FUS P525L aggregation by using SARS-CoV-2 infected HeLa cells (Fig. S9A) and HeLa cells with overexpressed N protein (Fig. S9B). These data strengthen the potential consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in stimulating protein amyloid aggregation in the host cells."

            "text": "Virus infection has been found to play an important role in the pathogenesis and clinical onset of human neurodegenerative diseases (Jang et al., 2009; Eimer et al., 2018; Readhead et al., 2018; Bellmann et al., 2019; Marreiros et al., 2020). Recent studies have shown that proteins of SARS-CoV-2 accumulate in the brain tissues of both transgenic mice and patients who died from COVID-19 (Matschke et al., 2020; Song et al., 2021). It has also been reported that\nSARS-CoV-2 can infect and replicate in astrocytes (Crunfli et al., 2021). Clinical correlation of SARS-CoV-2 infection and PD onset has also been reported. These observations raise the concern of neurodegeneration as a long-term consequence of COVID-19 (Bostanciklioglu, 2020; Gatto and Fernandez Boccazzi, 2020; Hascup and Hascup, 2020; Heneka et al., 2020; Singal et al., 2020). The answer for this concern is important for our treatment and policy to COVID19. Our work demonstrates that as SARS-CoV-2 infects the host cells, it has a strong potential to stimulate the amyloid aggregation of host proteins, which provides molecular evidence for the role of SARS-CoV-2 in triggering neurodegeneration (Fig. 6). During this process, the viral N protein is a major player. N protein can interact with a wide spectrum of SG proteins including FUS, TDP43, hnRNPA1, hnRNPA2, G3BP1, and G3BP2 as reported previously and in this work (Kaur and Lal, 2020; Luo et al., 2020; Moosa and Banerjee, 2020; Perdikari et al., 2020). Our NMR data showed that N protein non-specifically interacts with the LC domains of FUS and TDP43. Given that the SG-related RNA-binding proteins generally contain intrinsically disordered sequences, N protein may interact with other SG proteins via a similar mechanism. Direct interactions with various SG proteins underlie the partition of N protein into SGs; however, whether\nFigure 6. Schematic diagram for the interplay between SARS-CoV-2 and host SGs. During SARS-CoV-2 replication in host cells, the viral N protein enters the host SGs and directly interacts with SG-related amyloid-forming proteins (e.g., FUS, hnRNPA1 and TDP43), which stimulates the liquid to solid phase transition (amyloid formation) of these host proteins. Inefficient maintenance of proteostasis may result in accumulation of the pathological amyloid fibrils and development of neurodegeneration.\n610 \u00a9 The Author(s) 2022\nP ro te in\n& C e ll\nthis process is active or passive is obscure. SG formation is part of the antiviral responses of cells, which can assemble in response to viral infection and function to sequester host and viral mRNAs and proteins (Onomoto et al., 2012; Jain et al., 2016). On the other hand, N protein incorporation may hijack host SGs and alter their attributes. In addition, the viral genomic RNA, that assembles with N protein to form nucleocapsid, may facilitate the SG incorporation of N protein. Indeed, we observed that single-stranded RNA lowered the critical concentration of N protein for LLPS (Fig. S5). Note that in our experiments, we did not observe viral infection-triggered SG formation in either human HeLa cells or monkey Vero cells, which may be caused by reasons such as cell sensitivity, virus infection titer and time.\nMany evidences have indicated that disruption of SG dynamics is closely associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS and FTD (Molliex et al., 2015; Duan et al., 2019; Wolozin and Ivanov, 2019; Zhang et al., 2020). Our work demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 infection can impair the dynamics of SGs and promote amyloid aggregation of SG-related proteins. In addition, our data show that HeLa cells, that same as neurons, lack the ACE2 receptor, can be infected by SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. S1B). Consistently, recent studies have identified several other receptors that may contribute to ACE2-independent cell entry of SARSCoV-2 (Gao et al., 2020; Amraei et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2021; Gu et al., 2021b). These indicate that neurons are likely to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 as the virus invades the human brain. Our work provides molecular evidence for the increased risk of neurodegeneration after SARS-CoV-2 infection, and suggests paying a special attention to the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases in aged people under the current circumstances of ongoing widespread of SARS-CoV-2."
