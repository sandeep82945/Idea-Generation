    "abstractText": "Aflatoxins (AFs) are a group of secondary metabolites that cause several diseases in both animals and humans. Since the discovery of this group of toxins, several effects were revealed, such as hepatic changes, carcinoma, failure, and cancer of the liver. In the European Union, there are concentration limits for this group of mycotoxins in food and feed products; thus, these substances are required in their pure forms to prepare reference standards or certified reference materials. In our present work, a liquid\u2013liquid chromatographic method utilizing a toluene/acetic acid/water ternary system was improved. In order to enhance the purification and gain a higher amount of pure AFs in one separation run, a scale-up of the previous separation was carried out. In several scale-up steps\u2014including the determination of the maximum concentration and volume to load on a 250 mL rotor via a loop and via a pump as well, and the quadruplication of the entire separation procedure to a 1000 mL rotor\u2014an efficient scale-up was achieved. Utilizing a 250 mL rotor in an 8-hour workday, altogether approximately 2.2 g of total AFs could be purified with 8.2 liters of solvent, while on a 1000 mL column, approximately 7.8 g AFs could be prepared, utilizing around 31 liters of solvents.",

            "text": "Aflatoxins (AFs) are a group of mycotoxins discovered in the 1960s. This group of substances were firstly described in connection with the loss of several thousand turkeys and poultry [1,2]. It was shown that these toxins cause hepatic change in poultry and carcinoma of the liver in rats [3]. When food contaminated with AFs is consumed, it can cause a series of health issues in humans, including acute hepatic necrosis, acute liver failure, and liver cancer [4]. AFs are produced mainly by two Aspergillus species called Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus, belonging to the section Flavi of the Aspergillus genus [5,6]. Recently, 18 known analogs of aflatoxins were described, and among them, three series have significant importance from the food safety point of view, including the B-, G-, and M-series [6]. The B-series (AFB1 and AFB2) and the G-series (AFG1 and AFG2) were produced mainly by fungi, a group of structurally related difuranocoumarins, while the M-series (AFM1 and AFM2) could be detected primarily in animal tissues and fluids (milk and urine) as the hydroxylated metabolic products of the fungal AFs [7]. Among these compounds, AFB1 was shown to be the most toxic, with carcinogenic, mutagenic, and teratogenic properties leading to classify it as a Group 1 carcinogen by the IARC (1993) [8]. There have been several methods developed for the preparative separation and preparation of AFs, including the normal-phase (alumina and silica gel) [1,6,7,9,10] and the\nToxins 2023, 15, 178. https://doi.org/10.3390/toxins15030178 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/toxins\nToxins 2023, 15, 178 2 of 12\nreversed-phase preparative high-performance liquid chromatography [11,12], as well as recently the centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC), which is a hydrostatic type of liquid\u2013liquid chromatography [13]. Normal-phase chromatography is the oldest preparative chromatographic technique, which was first developed for the separation of the aforementioned toxins [1,6,7,10]. On alumina, the two groups of AFs (AFBs and AFGs) were separated by Nesbitt et al. [6], while when using silica gel, the four main AFs were successfully prepared with purities above 90% [7]. High-purity AFs were also achieved by several consecutive purifications with different elution ratios by Stubblefield et al. and De Jesus et al [9,10]. In 1977, preparative HPLC was used to have AFM1, AFB1, and AFG1 purified, from the mixtures of AFM1\u2013M2, AFB1\u2013B2, and AFG1\u2013G2 [11]. At the end of the separation procedure, 80 mg of AFB1 and AFG1 and 9\u201310 mg of AFM1 could be obtained, including at least two reverse-phase chromatographic runs for each compound. From 100 g of a contaminated and grained peanut sample, 500 \u00b5L of cleaned-up AF extract was injected to a preparative HPLC column [12]. It was demonstrated that even though performing multiple clean-up steps, the separation of these molecules turned out difficult, although the four AFs were separated from each other and from the impurities. Furthermore, in our previous paper, the successful separation and purification of AFs was described via CPC, achieving remarkable high yields and excellent recovery. In our previous experiment, a total of 1350 mg AFs was purified from 1.5 g crude A. parasiticus extract, applying only a single liquid\u2013liquid chromatographic run [13]. Scaling up in preparative chromatography can be carried out by applying different models of the calculations, starting from the existing basic separations [14,15]. In the case of liquid\u2013liquid chromatography, especially for centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC), a specific scale-up procedure termed the \u201clinear scale up method\u201d can be utilized [16,17]. In this chromatographic technique, the volume of the column is increased to achieve a larger yield, which is applied as the linear transfer factor to the proportionate alteration of other separation parameters. Another scaling-up approach is the \u201cfree space between peaks\u201d method, which is an experimental method also adaptable for the maximum load per run or for maximum productivity [18]. In the present study, the successful scale-up of our previous CPC process was achieved, optimizing the loading capacity of the method and applying a four times higher volumetric liquid\u2013liquid chromatographic column."

            "text": "According to our optimized method, the four main AFs were separated and purified by CPC in the ascendant mode on a 250 mL rotor, applying the upper and lower phase of the toluene/acetic acid/water 30:24:50 (v/v/v%) ternary system as the mobile and stationary phases, respectively. In a single chromatographic run, the four main AFs (AFB1, AFB2, AFG1, and AFG2) were separated and together from an injected amount of 90 mg crude AF extract, and a total of 81 mg of AFs was purified, reaching a 97.3% average purity and a 92.1% average recovery for the AFs [13]. According to the developed chromatographic conditions, the optimal flow rate was 15 mL/min, and the rotor speed was 1800 rpm. With these conditions, 60 mL of the stationary phase (24% of column volume) was extruded, providing this volume for the mobile phase (Vm), and the system pressure was 46 bar. Altogether, 60 fractions were collected in a 75-minute-long separation (Figure 1). Due to the stability of the method, the whole process was fully automatized, including the column filling, equilibration, elution, and the fraction collection as well.

Based on these unique advantages and the high resolution offered by CPC, this technique has been applied for the separation of certain mycotoxins [21\u201326]. In the work of Szekeres et al., fumonisin B1 and fumonisin B2/B3 mycotoxins were separated from the pre-purified extract of the Fusarium verticillioides rice culture by CPC in a 100 min run, with a purity of fumonisin B1 above 98% and a total recovery of 68% [21]. B-type fumonisins have also been purified from a F. verticillioides maize culture by two consecutive CPC separation steps. As a result, a total of 500 mg of fumonisin B1, 100 mg of B2, and 50 mg of B3 were obtained, with a purity above 98% from 1 kg of the maize culture; however, the recovery was not reported [22]. For the mycotoxins, nivalenol and fusarenon-X were purified by passing a crude acetonitrile extract of F. graminearum cultured on a pressed barley medium through silica gel and then running two consecutive CPC separations. From 1 kg of a pressed barley culture, 340 mg nivalenol and 600 mg fusarenon-X were obtained with a purity of 103% and 77%, respectively. The final recoveries of nivalenol and fusarenon-X calculated from their contents in the starting acetonitrile extract were 44 and 68 %, respectively [23]. Deoxynivalenol, another member of the trichothecene mycotoxins, was purified from rice and the moldy corn culture of F. graminearum via high-speed counter-current chromatography, which is a hydrodynamic type of the liquid\u2013liquid chromatography. This method produced 116 mg and 65 mg deoxynivalenol with a purity of greater than 94.9% from 200 g of the rice culture and the moldy corn, respectively. At these yields, the recovery rate of deoxynivalenol was 88% for both the rice culture and moldy corn based on the original deoxynivalenol concentration in the crude extracts analyzed by HPLC [24]. Similarly, a high-speed counter-current chromatography was used to purify the mycotoxin patulin produced by Penicillium expansum in sterilized apple juice. In that case, 21.9 mg of patulin was yielded from 50 mL of the apple juice culture while the purity and the recovery were 98.6% and 86.2%, respectively [25]. The purities of the AFs presented in our study fell into the range of 96.0 %\u201399.5%, which is comparable with the other purities achieved via the liquid\u2013liquid chromatography which ranged from 77% to 103% for the reported mycotoxins, including deoxynivalenol, fumonisin B1-B3, fusarenon-X, nivalenol, and patulin. Furthermore, the recoveries were obtained in the range of 53.0%\u201390.0% and 69.7%\u201385.3% for the 250 mL and 1000 mL columns, respectively. These recoveries were higher on both columns than it was obtained at nivalenol (44%), and the maximum recoveries were higher than the recoveries of fumonisins B1 (68%), fusarenon-X (68%), patulin (86.2%), and deoxynivalenol (88%) presented in the literature.\nToxins 2023, 15, 178 9 of 12"

With the application of the 250 mL rotor, altogether approximately 2.2 g of AFs could be purified with 8.2 liters of solvent daily (assuming an 8-hour workday), while on a 1000 mL column, approximately 7.8 g AFs could be prepared, utilizing around 31 liters of solvents per day. Based on our results, the most efficient CPC separation for the AFs purification can be achieved with the 1000 mL column injecting 100 ml of the crude extract via a pump injection regarding the purity and yield results."

Cultivation of the fungus was carried out according to our previously described method [13]. For the preparation of the crude extracts, one liter of ferment broth was partitioned sequentially with 500 mL and 250 mL dichloromethane. The organic phases were combined and evaporated to water. Then, methanol and hexane were added to this aqueous residue, resulting in 45:50:120 volumetric ratio for aquatic sample/methanol/hexane ratio, respectively. After the phase separation, the upper phase was removed, and further extraction was performed on that phase with water/methanol (45:50 by volume).

After the column was filled with the stationary phase, the mobile phase was pumped through to reach the hydrodynamic equilibrium. The equilibration and elution times were 20 min and 75 min, respectively, and the whole procedure lasted for 101 min. All separations were carried out in ascendant mode. During the separation, 20 mL fractions were collected. The 1 L rotor was filled up for 12 min with 100 mL/min with the stationary phase, then the flow rate was set to 60 mL/min during the equilibration and elution, while the rotor speed was held at 1267 rpm, achieving the same equivalent centrifugal field as on the smaller column. The equilibration and separations also lasted for 20 and 75 min, respectively, and 20 mL fractions were collected as well. UV detector was set to 366 nm during all separations."

One milliliter aliquot of each collected fraction was evaporated and resolved in 500\u00b5L acetic acid. Then, 5 \u00b5L of this solution was injected onto the HPLC system (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a DGU-14A degasser, an LC-20AD binary pump, an SIL20A autosampler, a CTO-10ASvp column thermostat, an SPD-10Avp UV-VIS detector, and a CBM-20A system controller. The data were acquired and evaluated with Class VP ver. 6.2 software (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). For the stationary phase, a Gemini C18, 250 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm, 5 \u00b5m particle size column was applied (Phenomenex, CA, USA), while the isocratic mobile phase was the mixture of water/methanol/acetonitrile (60:20:20, v,v,v%). During the 16 min separation, the flow rate was held 1 mL/min and the column temperature was maintained at 40 \u25e6C. Peaks were detected at \u03bb = 366 nm."
