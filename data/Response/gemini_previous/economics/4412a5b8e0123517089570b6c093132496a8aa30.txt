1. **Investigate the impact of LKMA's transformation on the financial performance of smallholder farmers.** This could be done by comparing the financial performance of farmers who have access to LKMA loans with those who do not. Researchers could also examine the impact of LKMA loans on farmers' income, productivity, and employment opportunities.


2. **Explore the factors that contribute to the sustainability of LKMA.** This could involve identifying the characteristics of LKMAs that are most likely to be sustainable, such as their size, location, and governance structure. Researchers could also examine the role of government support and regulation in promoting LKMA sustainability.


3. **Develop a model to predict the sustainability of LKMA.** This model could be used to help policymakers and practitioners identify LKMAs that are at risk of failure and to develop interventions to support these LKMAs. The model could also be used to identify the factors that are most important for LKMA sustainability, which could help policymakers and practitioners to develop more effective policies and programs.


4. **Assess the impact of LKMA on the local economy.** This could be done by examining the impact of LKMA loans on local businesses, employment, and economic growth. Researchers could also examine the impact of LKMA on poverty reduction and social welfare.


5. **Compare the performance of LKMA with other types of microfinance institutions.** This could involve comparing the interest rates, loan terms, and repayment rates of LKMA with those of other microfinance institutions, such as banks, credit unions, and NGOs. Researchers could also examine the impact of LKMA on the financial inclusion of smallholder farmers.
