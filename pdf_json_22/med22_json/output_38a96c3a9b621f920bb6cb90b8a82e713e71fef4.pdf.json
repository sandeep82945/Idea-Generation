            "text": "Covid-19: Omicron drives weekly record high in global infections Luke Taylor\nThe number of new covid-19 infections recorded worldwide from 27 December 2021 to 2 January 2022 increased by 71% from the previous week, says the WorldHealthOrganization\u2019sweekly epidemiological report.\nSome 9.5 million new cases of the disease were recorded\u2014the highest number to date and a sharp reversal of the steady decline in weekly cases that the world has seen since October 2021. Weekly infections rose by 65% in Europe, by 78% in Southeast Asia, and by 100% in the Americas.\nMaria Van Kerkhove, covid-19 technical lead for WHO\u2019sHealthEmergencies Programme, said that the global spike in infections was being driven by the omicron variant, which had been detected everywhere where good genetic sequencing was available. Omicron\u2019s mutations have made it better at adhering to human cells and escaping immunity from infection and vaccination.\nThe surge is also the result of a decrease in social distancing,maskwearing, and avoiding crowds. \u201cAll of those factors allow viruses to spread, whether it\u2019s omicron or something else,\u201d Kerkhove told a press conference on 8 January.\nGrowing international evidence shows that omicron is less likely than the delta variant to cause severe disease or hospital admission. While cases increased in every region, deaths declined everywhere except in Africa, where deaths were up by 22% on the previous week, WHO data showed."

            "text": "But the surge in infections is still translating to a high number of hospital admissions.\nMichael Touchton, head of the University of Miami\u2019s covid-19 policy observatory for Latin America, said that several LatinAmerican andCaribbean countries including Argentina were registering record daily infections and that their health systems were approaching capacity.\nThe region\u2019s rapid vaccination rate over the past six months has protected its hospitals from collapsing as many did earlier in the pandemic. Previously a key driver of global infections, Latin America is now the most vaccinated region in the world, with more than 63% of its population fully vaccinated.1\nBut the greater immune escape and infectiousness of omicron is starting to offset the lesser severity of illness it causeswhen it comes to hospitals\u2019 operating capacity. \u201cWe are seeing more people infected with milder cases of omicron, but even a smaller percentage of severe cases strains health systems when the raw number of cases is spiking,\u201d said Touchton.\nOf every 100 infections reported around the world last week, around 15 were recorded in Latin America and the Caribbean.2\nAs in Latin America, omicron\u2019s later arrival in Asia and its slower dispersion there have delayed the variant\u2019s impact when compared with Europe. Daily infections in India began to shoot up over the past weekandarenowmore than 10 timeswhat theywere on 1 January. India reported 179 723 new cases on 10 January and 146 deaths.\nAround 67% of people in India have been double vaccinated, and the government is administering booster shoes to healthcare staff, frontline workers, and people over 60.3\nThe increased infectiousness of omicron is testing the strategies of countries thatwere global exemplars in covid-19 containment. China\u2019s government restricted travel to and from the northern port city of Tianjin on 10 January in an effort to contain the 21 newomicron infections recorded there on9 January.4 To leave the city, residents must present approval from employers or community authorities for essential travel.\nSome 13 million residents in the northern city of Xi\u2019an\u2014one of several major cities experiencing omicron outbreaks, which could endanger China\u2019s hopes of a smooth hosting of the Winter Olympics on 4 February\u2014are now in their third week of lockdown. China reported 97 new cases on 9 January, up from 92 a day earlier.5"

The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has said that the country must \u201cpush through\u201d the omicron outbreak. Morrison\u2019s governmentwill ease isolation restrictions forworkers in food production and distribution who have come into contactwith someonewhohas an asymptomatic covid-19 infection. Some states have increased restrictions to slow the growing saturation of hospitals.6\nSenior WHO officials urged people to reduce their exposure to areas with a high risk of virus transmission and to get fully vaccinated, to prevent overcrowding in hospitals and unnecessary deaths.
