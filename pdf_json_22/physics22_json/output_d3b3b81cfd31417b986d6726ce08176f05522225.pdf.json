    "abstractText": "Neutrinos are the second most ubiquitous Standard Model particles in the universe. On the other hand, they are also the ones least likely to interact. Connecting these two points suggests that when a neutrino is detected, it can divulge unique pieces of information about its source. Among the known neutrino sources, core-collapse supernovae in the universe are the most abundant for MeV-energies. On average, a single collapse happens every second in the observable universe and produces 1058 neutrinos. The flux of neutrinos reaching the Earth from all the corecollapse supernovae in the universe is known as diffuse supernova neutrino background. In this Chapter, the basic prediction for the diffuse supernova neutrino background is presented. This includes a discussion of an average neutrino signal from a core-collapse supernova, variability of that signal due to the remnant formed in the process, and uncertainties connected to the other astrophysical parameters determining the diffuse flux, such as cosmological supernova rate. In addition, the current experimental limits and detection perspectives of diffuse supernova neutrino background are reported.",

            "text": "The night sky has always been a subject of humans\u2019 interest. Since the first observations through the naked eye centuries ago, humans have developed a myriad of telescopes that allowed us to witness photos from the whole range of the electromagnetic spectrum - these observations permitted us to decode pieces of information about multiple astrophysical objects. But only in the last century have new observation channels opened through cosmic rays (Hess, 1912) and neutrinos (Cleveland\nDepartment of Physics, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720, USA Department of Physics, University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, Madison, Wisconsin 53706, USA e-mail: asuliga@berkeley.edu\n1\nar X\niv :2\n20 7.\n09 63\n2v 1\n[ as\ntr o-\nph .H\nE ]\n2 0\net al, 1998). The latter ones are the second most abundant particles in the Universe. The Earth is submerged in a neutrino background spanning several orders of magnitude in energy (Koshiba, 1992; Haxton and Lin, 2000; Becker, 2008; Lunardini, 2010; Beacom, 2010; Spiering, 2012; Gaisser and Karle, 2017; Vitagliano et al, 2020). But neutrinos interact much more rarely than photons, they do not lose as much information on their way to the Earth as photons or charged particles. Consequently, they can provide insights beyond the ones that photons carry. A part of this ubiquitous neutrino background is comprised of neutrinos produced by the centers of all the past core-collapse supernovae in the Universe commonly named diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB) (Bisnovatyi-Kogan and Seidov, 1984; Krauss et al, 1984; Wilson et al, 1986; Ando and Sato, 2004); for more recent reviews see, e.g., (Beacom, 2010; Lunardini, 2010; Kresse et al, 2021; Horiuchi et al, 2021). This neutrino flux bears information of the entire core-collapse supernova population. The rest of this chapter is organized as follows; Section 2 outlines a short description of the DSNB calculation and discusses the uncertainty of the astrophysical parametrs entering the calculation. Section 3 discusses the current experimental limits on the DSNB and the future sensitivities."

            "text": "Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are one of the most efficient neutrino sources known so far (Alexeyev et al, 1988; Hirata et al, 1987; Bionta et al, 1987). In the centers of massive stars, the densities and temperatures are tremendously high, which permits the production of numerous amounts of neutrinos from electron capture on free protons and nuclei (Bethe et al, 1979; Fuller et al, 1982; Fuller, 1982; Bruenn, 1985; Martinez-Pinedo et al, 2012), deexcitation and thermal interactions of nuclei (Fuller and Meyer, 1991; Fischer et al, 2013; Martinez-Pinedo et al, 2012). These neutrinos carry almost the entire gravitational binding energy of the star within approximately tens of seconds (Burrows and Lattimer, 1986).\nThe initial picture of the core-collapse explosions assumed that the bounce shock that ceases the rapid infall of the inner core was energetic enough to lead to an observable in photons explosion. However, detailed calculations together with numerical simulations have shown that the bounce shock loses a significant fraction of its energy to photodissociation of heavy nuclei and ram pressure of the still infalling core. Due to that loss, the shock stalls after traveling only tens to hundreds\nof kilometers. (Colgate and White, 1966) and (Bethe and Wilson, 1985) postulated and explained how neutrinos streaming from the inner core could interact within the shock and reenergize it, leading to a supernova explosion. Initially, especially in spherically symmetric simulations, explosions were not achievable after including neutrino heating for massive progenitor stars. But the modern state-of-the-art 3D simulations (Burrows, 2000; Janka, 2012; Ott et al, 2013; Janka et al, 2016; Vartanyan et al, 2019; Burrows and Vartanyan, 2021) demonstrate that the delayed neutrino heating mechanism aided by the hydrodynamical instabilities and convectiondriven turbulence can lead to successful explosions (Blondin et al, 2003; Tamborra et al, 2014; Couch and Ott, 2015).\nThe distribution of energies emitted by the core-collapse has been found to be representable by the fit (Keil, 2003; Keil et al, 2003; Tamborra et al, 2012) of the from\n\u03d5\u03bdi(E\u03bdi , t) = \u03be\u03bdi(t) (\nE\u03bdi \u3008E\u03bdi(t)\u3009 )\u03b1\u03bdi (t) exp ( \u2212 (\u03b1\u03bdi(t)+1)E\u03bdi\u3008E\u03bdi(t)\u3009 ) , (1)\nwhere E\u03bdi is the neutrino energy, \u3008Ei(t)\u3009 is the average energy, and the normalization factor \u03be\u03bdi(t) = ( \u222b dE\u03bdi\u03d5\u03bdi(E\u03bdi , t))\u22121. The pinching parameter \u03b1i(t) which tells how much the spectrum differs from a pure Fermi-Dirac distribution; which is recovered in this form when \u03b1i(t) \u2261 \u03b1 = 2.3 and the mean energy is connected to the temperature by \u3008Ei(t)\u3009= 3.15 T\u03bdi(t). The differential flux of neutrinos (\u03bdi = {\u03bde, \u03bd\u0304e,\u03bd\u00b5 , \u03bd\u0304\u00b5 ,\u03bd\u03c4 , \u03bd\u0304\u03c4}) can be then expressed by the relation\nf\u03bdi(E\u03bdi , t) = L\u03bdi(t) \u3008E\u03bdi(t)\u3009 \u03d5\u03bdi(E\u03bdi , t) 4\u03c0D2 = F\u03bdi(E\u03bdi , t) 4\u03c0D2 , (2)\nwhere Li(t) is the luminosity and D is the distance to the supernova. The core collapse of a massive star can also lead to a direct black hole forma-\ntion (Fryer, 1999; Sekiguchi and Shibata, 2004b,a; Zhang et al, 2008; Fischer et al, 2009; O\u2019Connor and Ott, 2011a); plausibly without the observable electromagnetic radiation. In these cases, neutrinos may be the only detectable messengers from such an event. The directly black hole-forming progenitors are expected to produce more energetic neutrino spectra as the proto-neutron star masses are larger, leading to hotter and denser environments. In the case of neutron-star-forming core-collapse models, the mean energies of neutrinos tend to be between 10-18 MeV (Mirizzi et al, 2016), depending on the flavor. In the case of black-hole-forming models, the mean energies can grow to more than 20 MeV (Mirizzi et al, 2016)."

            "text": "Core-collapse occurs for relatively massive stars (8 M <\u223c M <\u223c 125 M ) (Heger et al, 2003) which are characterized by short lifetimes (approximately 106 yr) on a cosmic scale. Due to this, the frequency of core-collapse events can be calculated directly using the star formation rate (SFR, \u03c1\u2217) and initial mass function (IMF, \u03be ).\nThese two parameters tell respectively about the speed of the formation of stars per co-moving volume and the distribution of stars\u2019 masses at their births. Using them, the core-collapse supernova rate (CCSNR, RCC) can be calculated as\nRCC(z,M) = \u03c1\u0307\u2217(z)\u03be\u222b 125\n0.1 M dMM\u03be . (3)\nEmploying this method means that any uncertainties impacting the measurements of the SFR and IMF will propagate to the CCSNR, and consequantly DSNB; see, e.g., (Horiuchi et al, 2009; Lunardini and Tamborra, 2012; Mathews et al, 2014; Horiuchi et al, 2011; M\u00f8ller et al, 2018; Singh and Rentala, 2021; Suliga et al, 2022; Ziegler et al, 2022).\nAnother way of determining the core-collapse rate is by identifying the frequency of the supernova events using electromagnetic observations (Mattila et al, 2012; Dahlen et al, 2012; Strolger et al, 2015; Petrushevska et al, 2016). This method also has its challenges. One of them is the fact that these are low-frequency events at small redshifts (Beacom, 2010). Moreover, the observations can underestimate the rate if not all core-collapse lead to an observable explosion, for example, when the star instead evolves directly into a black hole or a significant dust obscuration prevents clean observation (Mattila et al, 2012).\nThe percentage of progenitors evolving into black holes found by theoretical calculations and numerical simulations varies between a few to tens of percent (O\u2019Connor and Ott, 2011b; Sukhbold et al, 2016; Sukhbold and Woosley, 2014; Ertl et al, 2016). There is also an effort to identify these stars by astronomical observations. Until now, two candidates have been found, among 27 nearby galaxies, which set the black hole-forming fraction to between approximately 4- 40% (Kochanek et al, 2008; Lien et al, 2010; Gerke et al, 2015; Adams et al, 2017b,a; Davies and Beasor, 2020; Neustadt et al, 2021).\nOn a separate note, (Horiuchi et al, 2011) identified a tension by a factor of two between the supernova rate calculated using the IMF and SFR and the one obtained directly from the observations of core-collapse explosions. This uncertainty propagates into DSNB modeling as well.\nLooking from the other side, the DSNB measurement is an independent indirect probe of the SNR and fraction of balck-hole-forming progenitors (Lunardini, 2009; Keehn and Lunardini, 2012; Horiuchi et al, 2011; Nakazato, 2013; Nakazato et al, 2015; Priya and Lunardini, 2017; Horiuchi et al, 2018; M\u00f8ller et al, 2018; Kresse et al, 2021; Singh and Rentala, 2021; Horiuchi et al, 2021; Libanov and Sharofeev, 2022; Ekanger et al, 2022).\nObservational evidence points out that most stars reside in binary systems (Sana et al, 2012; Zapartas et al, 2021), which opens up the possibility of binary interactions and introduces additional uncertainty in the DSNB. The binary interactions of massive stars can lead to redistribution of masses in the supernova population due to the mass transfer or changes in the number of stars undergoing core collapses by mergers. If two progenitors that were not expected to undergo supernovae form a star massive enough to undergo core collapse, the number of CCSN increases. On\nthe other hand, if both stars before the merger were expected to undergo CCSN, the mergers decreased the number of CCSN. Convolving these arguments with the IMF leads to the conclusion that the number of CCSN after including binary interactions increases. The effect of binary interactions on the DSNB can lead to a 0-75% increase in the flux (Horiuchi et al, 2021). The exact details depend on the modeling of the common envelope, in particular, how easy it is to unbind it and whether rotation effects are taken into account. The latter can lead to the development of more massive cores, which result in a larger neutrino flux (Horiuchi et al, 2021)."

The figure highlights how one of the uncertainties - the shape of the neutrino spectrum emitted from CCSN - modifies the DSNB. It also points out that higher fraction-of-black-hole forming stars in the entire CCSN population increases the high energy tail of the DSNB (Lunardini, 2009), as these stars are expected to produce hotter spectra. The shaded bands labeled Reactor, Solar, and Atmospheric indicate in which energy regions these irreducible neutrino backgrounds affect the DSNB measurement (see Section 3).\nWhile propagating through the supernova medium, neutrinos undergo flavor conversions due to their self-interactions and coherent forward scattering of the medium particles. The neutrino conversions may affect the DSNB flavor content. The solution to the neutrino flavor evolution inside the core-collapse supernova is yet to be found. The main difficulty, compared to neutrino flavor evolution in the Sun, is the possibility of the neutrino self-interactions which may lead to highly non-linear flavor evolution (Duan et al, 2010; Balantekin and Pehlivan, 2007; Chakraborty et al, 2016; Tamborra and Shalgar, 2020). Thus, detecting the DSNB in all flavors is vital to disentangle the astrophysical uncertainties from the effect of neutrino flavor conversions."

The detector then registers this light by photomultiplier tubes and detects the moving particle. But since neutrinos do not have an electric charge, to register their presence in the detector, they need to interact with the detector targets either by the momentum transfer or creation of a charged particle. In water, for neutrinos with energies close to O(10) MeV, \u03bd\u0304e have the largest probability of interaction with free protons through the Inverse Beta Decay (IBD)\n\u03bd\u0304e + p\u2192 n+ e+ . (5)\nUltimately, because the number of the hydrogen (proton) targets surpasses twice the number of the oxygen targets, the threshold for IBD reaction is low (Eth = 1.806 MeV), and both products of the reaction can be identified IBD is the primary DSNB observation channel in water Cherenkov detectors.\nTo reduce the backgrounds preventing the DNSB detection, SK has been adding gadolinium sulfate (GdCl3) (Beacom and Vagins, 2004) to the water in the tank since 2020. To understand how the addition of GdCl3 will help the background\nsuppression, let us take a closer look at how SK identifies the IBD events. In an IBD reaction, two products are made: a neutron and a positron. The positron emits Cherenkov radiation by which it can be identified. Unfortunately, in the DSNB energy window, several backgrounds emit Cherenkov radiation, e.g., decay electrons from invisible (with energies below the Chereknov threshold) atmospheric muons. To distinguish the signal from background events, coincident detection of neutron and positron is required.\nA way of doing so is looking for Cherenkov radiation followed up shortly by \u03b3 cascades, which come from excited by neutrons nuclei. This neutron-tagging procedure demands a target element that is both efficient neutron capturer and deexcites by emission of well-measured and observable \u03b3 cascade. So far this has been done using free protons. But it turns out that gadolinium has a cross section for thermal neutron capture, n+Gd\u2192 Gd\u2217\u2192 Gd+ \u03b3 , (6) \u2248 4.9 \u00b7 104 barn (Wolphram Research, 2022) (it is 105 times higher than thermal capture on free protons) and deexcites fast by a \u03b3 cascade with the total energy of 8 MeV which is much easier to observe in SK than 2.2 MeV deexcitation from protons. Addition of 0.1% GdCl3 to the water in SK should reduce the invisible muon background by almost a factor of 5 and leave only single spallation product (9Li) as background for the DSNB search (Beacom and Vagins, 2004; Abe et al, 2021). SK enriched with Gd might provide 3\u03c3 detection for the DSNB detection already after 5-10 years (Beacom and Vagins, 2004)."

This process has nearly the same cross section for all neutrino flavors (Freedman, 1974), and the coherence condition is satisfied within the detection window of DSNB for most nuclei employed by the CE\u03bdNS experiments. The detectors solely focused on measuring the neutrinos from accelerators (Akimov et al, 2017), and nuclear reactors (Akimov et al, 2013; Agnolet et al, 2017; Strauss et al, 2017; Hakenmu\u0308ller et al, 2019; Aguilar-Arevalo et al, 2019) are too small to register even a single DSNB event over tens of years.

This detection channel, however, has considerable challenges, a vast number of background events originating from solar neutrinos, radioactive decays of detector material, and cosmogenic backgrounds (An et al, 2016).\nSummary The diffuse supernova neutrino background is a guaranteed neutrino flux that encodes information about the entire core-collapse supernova population in the observable universe. Its detection can serve as an independent indirect measurement of the core-collapse supernova rate, the fraction of black-hole-forming\nsupernova progenitors, and the average neutrino flux per progenitor. Due to the unknowns connected to the neutrino flavor evolution in the dense environments and potential physics beyond the Standard Model in the neutrino sector, as well as uncertainties of the astrophysical parameters, to extract the most information, it is vital to detect diffuse supernova neutrino background in all flavors. The prospects for detecting the \u03bd\u0304e and \u03bde are optimistic.
