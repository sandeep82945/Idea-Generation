    "abstractText": "This study presents a novel approach for mapping global chromatin interactions using S1 nuclease, a sequenceagnostic enzyme. We develop and outline a protocol that leverages S1 nuclease\u2019s ability to effectively introduce breaks into both open and closed chromatin regions, allowing for comprehensive profiling of chromatin properties. Our S1 Hi\u2013C method enables the preparation of high-quality Hi\u2013C libraries, marking a significant advancement over previously established DNase I Hi\u2013C protocols. Moreover, S1 nuclease\u2019s capability to fragment chromatin to mono-nucleosomes suggests the potential for mapping the three-dimensional organization of the genome at high resolution. This methodology holds promise for an improved understanding of chromatin state-dependent activities and may facilitate the development of new genomic methods. Introduction Genomic assays, which profile chromatin properties on a whole-genome scale, rely significantly on enzymatic activities corresponding to different chromatin states. For instance, MNase-seq assay utilizes micrococcal nuclease\u2019s preferential digestion of nucleosome-free regions, while DNase hypersensitivity assay exploits DNase I enzyme\u2019s preferential cutting in open chromatin regions [1]. The discovery of transposase Tn5 and similar enzymes, which also exhibit affinity to open chromatin regions, has further simplified the analysis of open chromatin [2]. Therefore, expanding the repertoire of enzymes with specific, chromatin-state-dependent activities is crucial for developing novel genomic methods. In certain applications, enzymes with activity limited to specific chromatin states are necessary, while in others, uniform genomic coverage is essential. Chromatin conformation capture assays, including its whole-genome modification known as Hi\u2013C, notably benefit from using enzymes with sequence-agnostic chromatin cleavage. Hi\u2013C has been utilized by others and us to study genome architecture across various tissues [3] and individual cells [4], understand mechanisms underlying gene regulation in development [5, 6], explore alterations in gene expression in cancer [7], assemble genomes [8, 9], and identify structural variants [10]. The Hi\u2013C technique involves several mandatory steps: cell fixation with formaldehyde to preserve native genome folding in the nucleus, chromatin fragmentation, chromatin end labeling by biotin, and chromatin ligation [11]. Consequently, fragments in close spatial proximity are ligated, and a biotin label is employed to selectively enrich these ligated fragments. *Correspondence: Fishman Veniamin minja-f@ya.ru 1 Institute of Cytology and Genetics SB RAS, Novosibirsk, Russia 2 Novosibirsk State University, Novosibirsk, Russia 3 Institute of Chemical Biology and Fundamental Medicine, Novosibirsk, Russia 4 Research Centre for Medical Genetics, Moscow, Russia 5 Artificial Intelligence Research Institute, AIRI, Moscow, Russia Page 2 of 13 Maria et al. Epigenetics & Chromatin (2023) 16:48 Enzymes for chromatin fragmentation in an Hi\u2013C experiment can vary depending on the study\u2019s purpose. Initial protocols recommended using restriction enzymes with a 6  bp recognition site, limiting data resolution to approximately 10  kb [12]. However, the introduction of 4-base cutters and other modifications significantly improved this resolution [13]. Genome-wide distribution of restriction sites and sequencing depth are the limiting factors for resolving fine-scale chromatin organization. These limitations can be circumvented using a mixture of restriction enzymes or sequence-agnostic nucleases for chromatin fragmentation [14\u201316]. Currently, two sequence-agnostic enzymes, MNase and DNase I, are used in Hi\u2013C studies. MNase Hi\u2013C can generate nucleosome-level interaction maps and is proficient in loop detection, although it is less apt for compartment detection than conventional Hi\u2013C [17]. Using DNase I Hi\u2013C protocol improves data resolution and genomic coverage over conventional Hi\u2013C [15]. However, DNase I Hi\u2013C libraries contain a high level of non-informative fragments or \"dangling ends\" (DE) [11], necessitating deeper sequencing. S1 nuclease, a sequence-agnostic enzyme, degrades single-stranded nucleic acids and cleaves nick, gap, mismatch or loop structures in double-stranded DNA. S1 nuclease can also introduce breaks into double-stranded DNA at high enzyme concentrations [18]. S1 nuclease\u2019s ability to cleave unpaired DNA is exploited in S1-seq and S1-END-seq for studying DNA secondary structure and meiotic double-strand break end resection on a genomewide scale [19\u201321]. In this study, we delineate a profile of chromatin digestion by S1 nuclease and establish a protocol utilizing this enzyme for mapping global chromatin interactions. Our findings reveal that S1 nuclease effectively introduces breaks into both open and closed chromatin. The developed S1 Hi\u2013C method enables the preparation of high-quality Hi\u2013C libraries, surpassing the performance of the previously published DNase I Hi\u2013C protocol. Furthermore, S1 nuclease fragments chromatin to mono-nucleosomes, implying that the three-dimensional organization of the genome can be mapped with high resolution.",

            "text": "Genomic assays, which profile chromatin properties on a whole-genome scale, rely significantly on enzymatic activities corresponding to different chromatin states. For instance, MNase-seq assay utilizes micrococcal nuclease\u2019s preferential digestion of nucleosome-free regions, while DNase hypersensitivity assay exploits DNase I enzyme\u2019s preferential cutting in open chromatin regions [1]. The discovery of transposase Tn5 and similar enzymes, which also exhibit affinity to open chromatin regions, has further simplified the analysis of open chromatin [2]. Therefore, expanding the repertoire of enzymes with specific, chromatin-state-dependent activities is crucial for developing novel genomic methods. In certain applications, enzymes with activity limited to specific chromatin states are necessary, while in others, uniform genomic coverage is essential. Chromatin conformation capture assays, including its whole-genome modification known as Hi\u2013C, notably benefit from using enzymes with sequence-agnostic chromatin cleavage. Hi\u2013C has been utilized by others and us to study genome architecture across various tissues [3] and individual cells [4], understand mechanisms underlying gene regulation in development [5, 6], explore alterations in gene expression in cancer [7], assemble genomes [8, 9], and identify structural variants [10].\nThe Hi\u2013C technique involves several mandatory steps: cell fixation with formaldehyde to preserve native genome folding in the nucleus, chromatin fragmentation, chromatin end labeling by biotin, and chromatin ligation [11]. Consequently, fragments in close spatial proximity are ligated, and a biotin label is employed to selectively enrich these ligated fragments. *Correspondence: Fishman Veniamin minja-f@ya.ru 1 Institute of Cytology and Genetics SB RAS, Novosibirsk, Russia 2 Novosibirsk State University, Novosibirsk, Russia 3 Institute of Chemical Biology and Fundamental Medicine, Novosibirsk, Russia 4 Research Centre for Medical Genetics, Moscow, Russia 5 Artificial Intelligence Research Institute, AIRI, Moscow, Russia\nEnzymes for chromatin fragmentation in an Hi\u2013C experiment can vary depending on the study\u2019s purpose. Initial protocols recommended using restriction enzymes with a 6\u00a0 bp recognition site, limiting data resolution to approximately 10\u00a0 kb [12]. However, the introduction of 4-base cutters and other modifications significantly improved this resolution [13]. Genome-wide distribution of restriction sites and sequencing depth are the limiting factors for resolving fine-scale chromatin organization. These limitations can be circumvented using a mixture of restriction enzymes or sequence-agnostic nucleases for chromatin fragmentation [14\u201316]. Currently, two sequence-agnostic enzymes, MNase and DNase I, are used in Hi\u2013C studies. MNase Hi\u2013C can generate nucleosome-level interaction maps and is proficient in loop detection, although it is less apt for compartment detection than conventional Hi\u2013C [17]. Using DNase I Hi\u2013C protocol improves data resolution and genomic coverage over conventional Hi\u2013C [15]. However, DNase I Hi\u2013C libraries contain a high level of non-informative fragments or \"dangling ends\" (DE) [11], necessitating deeper sequencing.\nS1 nuclease, a sequence-agnostic enzyme, degrades single-stranded nucleic acids and cleaves nick, gap, mismatch or loop structures in double-stranded DNA. S1 nuclease can also introduce breaks into double-stranded DNA at high enzyme concentrations [18]. S1 nuclease\u2019s ability to cleave unpaired DNA is exploited in S1-seq and S1-END-seq for studying DNA secondary structure and meiotic double-strand break end resection on a genomewide scale [19\u201321].\nIn this study, we delineate a profile of chromatin digestion by S1 nuclease and establish a protocol utilizing this enzyme for mapping global chromatin interactions. Our findings reveal that S1 nuclease effectively introduces breaks into both open and closed chromatin. The developed S1 Hi\u2013C method enables the preparation of high-quality Hi\u2013C libraries, surpassing the performance of the previously published DNase I Hi\u2013C protocol. Furthermore, S1 nuclease fragments chromatin to mono-nucleosomes, implying that the three-dimensional organization of the genome can be mapped with high resolution."

Finally, we used the same script to generate plots (refer to Fig.\u00a04).\nTo identify S1 sequence specificity of the S1 cut sites, cut positions were obtained from the alignment files using the following script: \u201csamtools view -F 16 alignment.bam | awk \u2018$6 ~ \u201c^[0\u20139] + M\u201d && $0 ! ~ \u201cMD:Z:0[ACTG]\u201d {print $3, $4}\u2019\u201d for forward reads and \u201csamtools view -f 16 alignment.bam | awk \u2018$6 ~ \u201cM$\u201d && $6 ~ \u201c^[0\u20139] + M\u201d && $0 ! ~ \u201c[ACTG]0[[:space:]]\u201d && $0 ! ~ \u201c[ACTG]0$\u201d {sum = $4 + 99; print $3, sum}\u2019\u201d for reverse reads. Genomic regions flanking cut sites were extracted using pysam. Consensus logo for the extracted sequences was created using WebLogo 3.5.0.\nRead coverage depth analysis To analyze read coverage depth Hi\u2013C data prepared with S1, DNase I, MNase, DpnII, and MboI enzymes were aligned with bwa mem and converted to normalized read coverage tracks (bigWig files) by deepTools 3.5.1 bamCoverage with the option --normalizeUsing\u00a0RPKM [22]. To build distributions of read coverage depth genomewide each individual chromosome in bigWig file was divided into segments of 500 nucleotides (excluding last segment), followed by calculation of the coverage sums in each segment. Analysis was performed using pyBigWig 0.3.18 [22] and NumPy 1.21.6 [23]; the histograms of distributions were plotted using matplotlib 3.5.3 [24] and seaborn 0.13.0 [25].\nTo compare coverage of the specific genomic elements (such as A/B-compartments or chromatin states), genomic segments for coverage sums calculation were selected according to annotation tracks. For general chromatin state segmentation we utilized publicly available GRCh37/hg19 version of Broad ChromHMM track from ENCODE/Broad [26], lifted over to hg38 human genome assembly using CrossMap 0.6.4 tool [27]. Generation of track for A and B compartments from 4DNFI18UHVRO data from 4D Nucleome Data Portal is described in Compartmentalization section of Methods. We attributed coverage sums for A or B compartment based on the\nvalue of E1 vector: genomic regions with top 15% value of E1 were assigned as A and lowest 15% were assigned as B.\nBoxplots of distributions were plotted using matplotlib 3.5.3 and seaborn 0.13.0.\nHi\u2013C matrices correlation analysis (reproducibility scores computation) To assess correlation of Hi\u2013C matrices for pairs of replicates we utilized matrices on a resolution of 100 000 base pairs with balancing weights applied (from mcool files generated as described in Compartmentalization section of Methods). For each matrix pair we calculated distribution of Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficients by comparing row from one matrix to its corresponding row from second replicate (using cooler 0.8.5, SciPy 1.7.2 and NumPy 1.21.6 packages). Boxplots of distributions were plotted using matplotlib 3.5.3 and seaborn 0.13.0 [25]."

            "text": "Boosting data yield in\u00a0Hi\u2013C protocol through\u00a0DNase I substitution with\u00a0S1 nuclease Previously, we established a robust and efficient DNase I Hi\u2013C protocol, yielding high-quality Hi\u2013C maps [11]. Nevertheless, this method generated more dangling ends (DEs) compared to the traditional Hi\u2013C approach. DEs represent non-chimeric DNA fragments that do not contribute valuable information for Hi\u2013C analysis. These fragments are reduced during Hi\u2013C library preparation through a following process: DNA ends are labeled with biotin after chromatin digestion; biotinylated nucleotide internalization following DNA end ligation; biotinylated nucleotides remaining on the unligated DNA ends are removed using exonuclease; molecules containing internal biotin (i.e., ligation products) are enriched by streptavidin pulldown. We suspect that the surplus of DEs in the DNase I Hi\u2013C protocol is attributed to the nickase activity of DNase I. Following DNase I digestion, the 5\u2019\u20133\u2019 exonuclease activity of the Klenow Fragment elongates the nicks, incorporating biotin\u2013dCTPs into the DNA molecule. Consequently, not only are the ligation products internally labelled with biotin, but also DNA molecules that have not participated in the ligation process.\nLike DNase I, S1 nuclease is a sequence-agnostic nuclease capable of cleaving dsDNA, nicks, and ssDNA. We theorized that these activities of S1 nuclease could prevent the generation of nicked DNA during chromatin digestion. To verify this, we first ensured that the S1 enzyme could digest formaldehyde-fixed chromatin, producing a discernible digestion pattern (Fig.\u00a0 1A). Subsequently, we modified the cell lysis and chromatin fragmentation steps (see Methods) to make the Hi\u2013C protocol compatible with the S1 chromatin digestion.\nUsing this modified method, we prepared S1 Hi\u2013C libraries for 16 human peripheral blood samples and the K562 human immortalized cell line. During libraries preparation, we examined the products of digestion and ligation steps and found that they satisfy Hi\u2013C quality standards (Fig.\u00a01A), although we note that the pattern of chromatin fragmentation by S1 nuclease looks slightly different for different cell types (Fig.\u00a01A).\nNext, we performed shallow sequencing of these samples to assess data quality and deeper sequencing for K562 sample to produce Hi\u2013C map (Fig.\u00a01B, C). The quality assessment shows that compared to DNase I Hi\u2013C, S1 Hi\u2013C produces similarly high-quality data (Fig.\u00a01B); however, the quantity of DEs was lower for S1 Hi\u2013C, resulting in higher overall yield of valid Hi\u2013C pairs. This confirms that the fraction of DE is a consequence of DNase I nickase activity, and that replacing DNase I with S1 can reduce the amount of DE fragments. In addition, S1- and DNase I-based Hi\u2013C assays produce the smallest number of PCR duplicates compared to MNase and DpnII Hi\u2013C data (Additional file\u00a01: Fig. S1).\nThe DNase I enzyme exhibits a crucial characteristic: its ability to generate Hi\u2013C libraries with a relatively even coverage distribution. Despite a moderate enrichment of A-compartment sequences in DNase I Hi\u2013C libraries [28], this enrichment is less pronounced than that observed at the ends of restriction fragments in conventional Hi\u2013C libraries. To evaluate the potential coverage bias in S1 Hi\u2013C libraries, we computed the distribution of coverage depth across the genome in S1, DNase I, MNase, and DpnII Hi\u2013C samples from K562 (Fig.\u00a0 1D). Our findings revealed that S1, MNase, and DNase I Hi\u2013C maintain relatively even coverage distribution. The same result can be obtained using interquartile range of coverage distribution as measure of its uniformity, as shown in Fig.\u00a01D. In contrast, DpnII Hi\u2013C exhibits a bimodal distribution, highlighting the disparity between sequences proximal and distal to restriction sites. Median coverage of loci attributed to A- and to B-compartment was almost similar in case of DNase I and S1 enzymes. In the MNase Hi\u2013C data we observed a slight preference\ntowards higher coverage of A-compartment (Additional file\u00a01: Fig. S2A). We also performed more detailed analysis of coverage including 15 chromatin states annotated by HMM tool and did not identify any substantial bias specific to S1 enzyme (Additional file\u00a01: Fig.\u00a02B).\nWe next assessed how well patterns of Hi\u2013C data, such as TADs, loops and compartments can be detected using different enzymes. For this analysis, we again utilized Hi\u2013C data for K562 cells, which were generated using different enzymes. As can be seen from Fig.\u00a02, A, compared to MNase data, results obtained using S1 and DNase I provide better contrast of within vs between compartment interactions. On the other hand, TADs and loops are better resolved using MNase enzyme (Fig.\u00a0 2B, C). Enzymes with specific recognition site, MboI and DpnII, generate data that is comparable with MNase in compartments analysis, and show the worst result in TADs and loop detection benchmarks (Fig.\u00a02A\u2013C). In addition, S1 Hi\u2013C data show highest reproducibility scores (measured as average Spearman\u2019s correlation between replicates) (Fig.\u00a02F).\nFinally, we assess robustness of S1 Hi\u2013C method across cell types. For this aim, we prepared Hi\u2013C libraries from human fibroblasts and iPS cells using the same chromatin digestion conditions as for K562 and PBMC cells. In both cases, we obtained high-quality results (Additional file\u00a03: Table\u00a0 S2, Additional file\u00a0 1: Fig. S1). This indicates that chromatin digestion conditions presented here are robust enough, and although optimization might be required for specific cell types, the released protocol can be used as a starting point in S1 Hi\u2013C experiments.\nAltogether, our results show that the use of S1 nuclease for chromatin fragmentation makes it possible to achieve the coverage uniformity as in DNase I and MNase Hi\u2013C and, at the same time, to improve the quality compared to DNase I Hi\u2013C data in terms of dangling ends fraction.\nEvaluating the\u00a0cut site distribution in\u00a0chromatin following\u00a0S1 nuclease digestion Our data suggest that S1 nuclease can be used to digest chromatin, which opens the possibility to apply S1\nFig. 1 S1 Hi\u2013C protocol allows the generation of high-quality Hi\u2013C maps.

Although the Hi\u2013C data analysis shows that S1 digestion is fairly uniform across the genome, the complex structure of Hi\u2013C library molecules precludes the precise identification of cut site locations. Therefore, we decided to characterize profiles of S1 nuclease digestion using fixed chromatin, which we fragmented by the enzyme and sequenced. The analysis of the obtained NGS reads revealed that the genomic fragments generated by S1 nuclease start with guanine at their 5\u2019-end approximately two-times more frequent than expected (Fig.\u00a03A). Thus, S1 nuclease has a slight preference to cut\nthe primary strand immediately upstream of the guanine. Interestingly, we did not observe enrichment of cytidine in genomic position immediately before cut site, which would be expected in the case of symmetric cut (Additional file\u00a01: Fig.\u00a0S3A, B). This suggests that S1 nuclease probably cleaves DNA strands asymmetrically to form 3\u2019-sticky ends (Additional file\u00a01: Fig.\u00a0S3A, B); the length of the overhang cannot be determined from our data. These ends could be degraded by S1 nuclease or during subsequent end repair steps of the library preparation. To obtain a comprehensive map of DNA accessibility and understand how enzyme concentration affects digestion pattern, we treated fixed K562 cells chromatin with different concentrations of S1 nuclease: 10, 200, 500 and 1000 units. Gel-based analysis of the digestion products showed that, expectedly, higher enzyme concentration\nresults in smaller average fragment lengths (Fig.\u00a0 3B). The digestion pattern was slightly different for K562 and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), the latter showing pronounced nucleosome-sized ladder.\nTo better characterize digestion profiles, we sizeselected the digestion products to remove DNA fragments larger than 1000\u00a0bp and subjected the remaining DNA to NGS-library construction and paired-end sequencing. In all studied conditions, we observed clear mononucleosomal peak (~ 150\u2013200\u00a0bp) (Fig.\u00a03C). Interestingly, treatment\u00a0 of K562 chromatin with the highest S1 concentration (1000 units) results in two peaks, one corresponding to mononucleosomes (~ 150\u2013200\u00a0bp) and another to dinuclosomes (~ 350\u00a0 bp) (Fig.\u00a0 3C). Besides that, there is little difference in fragment lengths distribution for studied S1 concentration (Fig.\u00a03C). For PBMCs, we profiled single S1 concentration (200 units) and observed prominent mononuclesosmal peak accompanied by less pronounced dinucleosomal peak (Fig.\u00a0 3D). The S1 fragments sizes distribution resembled the nucleosomal pattern observed for MNase, thus we reanalyzed data from [29] to compare S1 digestion pattern with the pattern produced by different MNase concentrations (Fig.\u00a0 3D). MNase digests unprotected linker DNA between nucleosomes, while the DNA protected by the nucleosomes remains intact [30]. Low MNase concentrations generate fragment length distribution corresponding to mono-nucleosome-bound fragments and linker DNA. An increase in MNase concentration leads to a reduction of linker DNA due to its exonuclease activity and fragment length shift to 147\u00a0bp (Fig.\u00a03D). Comparison of fragment length distributions suggests that S1 nuclease generates longer fragments than MNase under all conditions, arguing that it is more likely to introduce breaks between nucleosomes and has either no or reduced (compared to MNase) exonuclease activity.\nNext, we aggregated the S1 nuclease, DNase I, and MNase DNA break location frequencies across annotated open chromatin features: ATAC-seq peaks and DNase I hypersensitive sites (HS) in K562 cells. As DNase I HS and ATAC-seq peaks both align with cisregulatory elements, such as promoters and enhancers of actively transcribed genes, the aggregation of cut sites for these enzymes displays a high degree of concordance (Fig.\u00a04). The location of MNase cut sites is dependent on enzyme concentration: at low concentrations, the signal heightened across open chromatin regions, implying that these were the first sites accessible to the enzyme. Conversely, at higher MNase concentrations, open chromatin regions were depleted due to elevated digestion of accessible chromatin. The pattern observed for S1 enzyme across DNase I or ATAC-seq peaks also shows similar trend. For low S1 concentration, we detect enrichment\naround open chromatin regions, whereas for higher concentration we observe reduced signal in the middle of the peak, followed by gradual increase with nucleosomal pattern (waves). This signal resembles the pattern observed for moderate or high MNase concentrations; however, nucleosomal pattern was less pronounced than for high MNase concentration, suggesting that S1 nuclease may not have the strong exonuclease activity required to digest linker DNA.\nNucleosome positioning and chromatin accessibility shows non-random pattern across gene promoters, with the level of accessibility correlating with the gene expression. We analyzed the chromatin cut frequency across transcription start sites (TSS) stratifying genes by the expression level (Fig.\u00a0 4). Both S1 nuclease and MNase show decreased fragment ends frequency near TSS of actively expressed genes, presumably because these regions are accessible to enzyme and over-digested, producing very small fragments (or even digested into individual nucleotides), that cannot be captured by sequencing. The reduced signal region was broader in S1 nuclease data than in MNase data, and does not show a clear nucleosome pattern.\nDrawing from these findings, we speculate that S1 nuclease exhibits greater activity on DNA bound to nucleosomes than MNase, while its exonuclease activity to digest linker DNA is either lower or non-existent. This results in a more uniform distribution of S1 nuclease cut sites in comparison with MNase (which is additionally supported by analysis of Hi\u2013C reads coverage distribution presented in Fig.\u00a01E). In relation to DNase, S1 nuclease presents a decreased representation of fragment ends within open chromatin regions, a pattern that may be attributable to the presence of exonuclease activity, or possibly due to high endonuclease activity that reduces these loci into fragments too minuscule for detection. Finally, S1 nuclease shows slight preference towards cleavage of guanine 5-phosphate bonds, leaving a 3\u2019-overhang on the complementary strand. Despite these preferences, the overall pattern of S1 cuts is relatively uniform (compared to DNase I or MNase digestion) and thus allows studying both open and closed chromatin."

We developed a robust and efficient\nprotocol for S1 Hi\u2013C analysis of PBMC, which can be used to capture structural variants in cells and tissues in humans. Future applications can extend S1 Hi\u2013C protocols for genome assembly and haplotyping.\nOur analysis of S1 digestion products provides detailed information for developing of future genomic assays based on S1 enzyme. We note that this assay is based on short-read sequencing and includes size-selection procedure. Therefore, our analysis is biased towards relatively small (< 1\u00a0 kb) genomic fragments. Within this fragment length, S1 nuclease shows relatively uniform digestion profile generating mainly nucleosome-sized fragments.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1186/ s13072- 023- 00524-4.\nAdditional file\u00a01: Supplementary Figures S1-S3.\nAdditional file\u00a02: Table\u00a0S1.
