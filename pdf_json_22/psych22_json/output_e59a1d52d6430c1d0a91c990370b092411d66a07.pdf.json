Thus, this study aimed to examine the associations\nbetween TV, PA, and depressive symptoms, considering sociodemographic covariates.\nMethods: A sample of 29,285 adults (13,943 men; 15,342 women) with a mean age\nof 50.9 \u00b1 17.4 years (50.6 \u00b1 17.3 men; 51.1 \u00b1 17.5 women) from the European\nSocial Survey agreed to be respondents for this study. Data for sociodemographic\nvariables, TV watching, PA, and depressive symptoms were self-reported. Different\nstatistical procedures were conducted to provide evidence for the association between\nstudy variables. ANCOVA was used to analyze the association between TV watching\nand depressive symptoms. Linear regression analysis was conducted to analyze\nthe association between PA and depressive symptoms. General Linear Model was\nperformed to analyze the association of TV watching and on depressive symptoms,\ncontrolling for PA.\nResults: European adults who responded watching more than 2 h per day showed\nhigher scores for depressive symptoms. Higher participation in PA was negatively and\nsignificantly associated with depressive symptoms in men (\u03b2 = \u22120.15, 95% CI: \u22120.18,\n\u22120.13), and women (\u03b2 = \u22120.23, 95% CI: \u22120.26, \u22120.21). Men spending 1\u20132 h/day\nTV watching and engaging in PA \u2265 5 days/week presented the lowest scores on\ndepressive symptoms. The lowest scores on depressive symptoms was observed in\nwomen engaging 2\u20134 days/week in PA and spending <1 h/day in TV watching.\nConclusions: More time spent in TV watching is related with increased scores on\ndepressive symptoms. However, regular PA participation can weaken this association.\nKeywords: exercise, quantitative study, sedentary living, depression, mental health"

            "text": "Depression has been described as one of the most prevalent mental disorders among adults for the last two decades (1), and is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide (2). Despite depression affecting people of different ages and sexes, it is nearly twice as common in women than in men (1). The difference in the prevalence of depression between men and women is linked to biological and psychological differences in susceptibility and environmental factors operating in both microlevel and macrolevel (3). For instance, women undergo internal endocrine processes associated with the reproductive cycle, increasing the risk of depression during reproductive age (4). Furthermore, depression is associated with increased vulnerability, mortality and reduced life expectancy (5), mainly due to a higher risk for developing cardiovascular diseases (6). Therefore, it is expected an increased economic burden due to treatment costs and productivity loss (7). Thus, new strategies to prevent depression is paramount for public health authorities.\nThe symptoms associated with depression affect one\u2019s ability to function at work and to deal with daily life events. Thus, depressive symptoms mark an impact in the quality of life and are indicative of clinical depression. Symptoms such as: psychosocial incapacity; reduced productivity in work and dayto-day activities; higher risk of work absenteeism; depressed humor; changes in appetite; fatigue or loss of energy; reduced ability to concentrate, think and make decisions; lack of interest or pleasure are some of the symptoms of possible depression.\nAmong the protective factors for depressive symptoms, physical activity (PA) has been associated as a major contributor to mental health (8\u201310). Additionally, regular physical exercise reduces the incidence and severity of health problems and chronic diseases, and increases quality of life, thus making it an important constituent of health promotion (11). The scientific evidence continues to build as physical exercise is also associated with physical and mental benefits that can start accumulating with small frequency (e.g., 2 times per week) every week (12). PA related to depressive symptomatology, there is evidence that individuals with higher levels of PA had a 17% lower risk for depression when compared with those with lower PA (8).\nSedentary behavior (SB) is defined as any behavior characterized by an energy expenditure \u2264 1.5 metabolic equivalents such as sitting, lying, television watching (13). Initial effort to better understand SB levels has led to growing research interest in recent years related to its associated health risk. Current evidence has showed SB as a risk factor linked to increased depressive symptoms (14). Previous research has shown that mentally-passive behavior, such as watching TV, can be associated with mental illness (14\u201316). Specifically, more time spent on TV viewing is related to increased levels of depressive symptoms. Research suggests that spending longer periods of time watching TV was associated with a 13% increased risk of depression (17).\nMethodological challenges to the research of physical activity and TV viewing associated with depressive symptoms include the need for large and heterogeneous samples that can build robust evidence to identify patterns. This might be particularly\ndifficult if we consider only one region or culture (e.g., Portugal) since individuality and other sociodemographic variables may display some moderating role (e.g., age and sex). To the best of our knowledge, a proper investigation of the relationships between PA, SB, and depressive symptoms, considering the moderating role of sociodemographic variables, has only begun recently (10, 18). In addition, most of the previous studies have focused on only one country or culture, limiting interpretation of the results. Most of the studies have partially examined the associations between these variables suggesting the need to explore in detail the different relationships between PA, SB, and depressive symptoms, as a mean to provide solid evidence for researchers and public health agents to reverse current trends of increased physical inactivity, increase SB engagement, and increased levels of depressive symptoms in the European population (19, 20).\nWhile previous studies have shown that PA can reduce the detrimental effects of TV watching on a variety of psychological distress indicators (16, 21), there is still a gap on how these associations are similar among different cultures. Considering that clinical depression is expected to increase over the following years, and since TV viewing and PA are associated with depressive symptoms (8, 17), this study aimed to: (1) analyze the independent association between time spent TV watching and depressive symptoms, as well as, PA participation and depressive symptoms; and (2) investigate the potential protective effect of PA in the relationship between TV watching and depressive symptoms in a large sample of European adults. The exploratory hypothesis was that TV watching would have a positive and significant association with depressive symptoms. On the other hand, PA would display a negative and significant association with depressive symptoms. Last, PA would attenuate the positive association between TV viewing and depressive symptoms, considering the moderating role of age and gender. These assumptions are based on limited evidence."

This version contains eight questions (example: \u201chow much time they felt depressed in the last week\u201d). Each item is scored from 1 (none or almost none of the time) to 4 (all or almost all the time) and the score ranged from 0 to 24. Two items were reverse coded. A higher score indicates higher levels of depression symptoms. Specifically, a score of \u22659 was used as a cut-off value to identify elevated depression symptoms (25). The CES-D8 is a valid and reliable instrument for screening depression in the adult population in several countries (26)."

Participants were asked what their occupation was in the past 7 days before the interview. Response options were used to create six categories: employed; student; retired; unemployed; sick or disabled; and housework, looking after children. To determine the living place, participants were asked to report whether they lived in a big city, suburbs, or outskirts of a big city, town or small city, country village, or home in the countryside. A\nnew category named urban areas was created for those who answered that they lived in a big city, suburbs, or outskirts of a big city. Those who responded that they lived in a country village or home in the countryside were grouped into the rural area\u2019s category. Socioeconomic status was determined based on decile. Using the data, 1st\u22123rd, 4th\u22127th, and 8th\u221210th decile were grouped to create three groups: low, middle, and high socioeconomic status, respectively. Since the above mentioned sociodemographic variables are determinant factors of PA and SB (27) we selected them as covariates."

To analyze the association between the time spent TV watching and scores for depressive symptoms, an ANCOVA was performed, adjusted for sex. Linear regression was conducted to analyze the association between PA and the score for depressive symptoms. First, an unadjusted model was performed. Further analyses were adjusted for employment status, living place, children, socioeconomic status, marital status, and age. Finally, according to PA frequency, a General Linear Model was used to analyze the effect of time spent TV watching on depressive symptoms. This analysis was stratified by sex and adjusted for employment status, living place, children, socioeconomic status, marital status, and age. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics v.25.0. The significance level was set to p < 0.05."

            "text": "This study aimed to analyze the independent association between time spent TV watching and depressive symptoms, as well as the relationship between PA participation and depressive symptoms, and investigate the potential moderating effect of PA in the relationship between TV watching and depressive symptoms in a large European adult population, controlling for sociodemographic variables. Our findings suggest that more time spent TV watching was associated with higher depressive symptoms. In contrast, increased levels of PA were associated with significant reduced depressive symptoms. Moreover, PA seems to show a moderating effect in the association between time spent TV watching and depressive symptoms.\nResults showed that the association between TV watching and scores for depressive symptoms was higher in the independent\nmodels among individuals who spent >3 h/day watching TV. These results support the hypothesis that spending a greater amount of time TV watching is associated with increased depressive symptoms, providing further evidence on the detrimental effect of SB on mental health (14). Despite the uncertain mechanisms associating SB such as TV watching and\nFrontiers in Public Health | www.frontiersin.org 5 January 2022 | Volume 9 | Article 799870\ndepressive symptoms, existing literature points out potential factors such as lower social contact, poorer sleep quality (30), and also levels of metabolic markers suggesting a reduced insulin sensitivity and inflammation (31). Specifically, there is evidence that increased SB may be linked to reduced PA engagement, which can contribute to lower scores on mental health (14, 32). Nevertheless, previous research suggests that time spent TV watching is associated with increased ingestion of highly dense and nutritionally poor food (33), which is also related to increased inflammation (34), one factor that is related to depressive symptoms (35, 36).\nParticipants who spent <1 h/day TV watching had a higher score for depressive symptoms, regardless of PA engagement when compared to those who watched 1\u20132 h/day of TV and 2\u2013 3 h/day of TV (only in men). Accordingly, our results support previous research suggesting that individuals spending <1 h/day andmore than 2 h/day watching TV have an increased depressive symptomatology among the adult population (37).\nPrevious investigations suggest that PA has a negative effect on depressive symptoms (38). In line with proposed hypothesis, our results indicate that PA may reduce depressive symptoms regardless of sex. However, women seem to benefit more from engaging in PA compared to men as a mean to reduce depressive symptoms. These results support evidence, suggesting a protective effect of PA against the possible development of depression (39).\nIn general, men had the lowest score for depressive symptoms when engaging in \u22655 times/week in PA. Among men engaging in \u22655 times/week in PA, those who spent 1\u20132 h/day TV watching had the lowest score of depression. For women, the lowest score of depressive symptoms was observed for those engaging 2\u20134 times/week in PA and reporting <1 h/day of TV watching. Bearing this in mind, our results support the findings of previous research suggesting that frequent engagement in PA reduces depression symptoms (8, 39). While the associations found in our study were substantial, the cross-sectional nature of the data prevents any interpretation of causality. Nevertheless, some plausible mechanisms of action could explain why PA reduces the harmful effect of watching TV in depression. Increased SB time has a negative effect on sleep (40). Depressed individuals have greater sleeping problems and lower PA levels (41). Research suggests that interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-\u03b1) may be directly involved in sleep regulation (42). SB is associated with increased expression of those cytokines (31), on the other hand, PA can regulate the expression of those inflammatory biomarkers (43). PA has a positive effect on brain functioning throughout the lifespan (44). For instance, it was found that increased levels of plasmatic brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) after 4 sessions of 30- min cycling at an intensity of 60% of peak oxygen intake (45). BDNF has a key role in neurogenesis and has been negatively associated with sedentary time (44). Thus, we speculate that PA might attenuate the negative effect that SB time has on the expression of BDNF. Moreover, watching TV increases the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) (22), which can be regulated through PA (46). Higher levels of CRP are associated with increased depression severity (47). Therefore, providing more\nopportunities for PA can be an effective strategy to prevent depression (9, 10)."

Future interventions should focus on the reduction of time spent TV watching and increasing PA participation as a mean to reduce depressive symptoms. Policies should promote less time TV watching in the early life stages and should be a priority since research has found that SB habits from earlier life years proceed to adulthood (48). Providing more opportunities for engaging in PA should be a priority for public authorities to reduce the individual and the economic burden associated with poor mental health (7)."

Additionally, this study addresses limitations related to previous studies (10) in which only simple association tests were conducted that do not account for the variability based on sociodemographic variables. The robustness in the statistical analysis, as well as the large sample size and controlling for sociodemographic variables are strengths of the current research.\nSome limitations must be acknowledged. Study variables were self-reported, which are susceptible to bias. PA was obtained through a question, lacking data on frequency, intensity, time, and type based on the ACSM protocol (11). This lack of information prevents a more precise calculation of METs which are indicative on PA engagement. Thus, future studies should focus on collecting more data on PA engagement, considering its manifestations.\nWhile this study controlled the associations between TV watching, PA, and depressive symptoms adjusted for employment status, living place, children, socioeconomic status, marital status, and age, future studies should consider other covariates such as body mass index, smoking, and alcohol consumption. Thus, current results should be considered based on covariates under analysis and caution must be taken when interpreting present evidence."
