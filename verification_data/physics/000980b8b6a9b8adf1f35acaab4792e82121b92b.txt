Given the extensive nature of the provided text and its focus on future research directions, here are the key excerpts that specifically mention or imply future research directions or areas for further investigation:

1. "Finally, we suppose that our review on this developing field will be valuable for promoting the progress of ROS-based cytotoxic therapies not only in basic research but overall, in translational research and clinical application."
   
2. "Even if significant achievements have been reached in PDT thanks to UCNPs, their therapeutic efficacy is still not suitable enough to completely fulfil the strict requisites of clinical translation."

3. "Therefore, novel UCNPS have been studied to successfully shift the excitation of UCNPs from 980 to 808 nm, being the heating effect minimized and the tissue transparency maximized."

4. "Despite growing interest, the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic activity of US have not yet been clearly elucidated, slowing the clinical application of SDT."

5. "Unfortunately, no more investigations from these authors but also from other researchers have been performed to confirm the presence of SL in vivo, therefore the role of SL in SDT in vivo still remains elusive."

6. "To improve the therapeutic efficacy of CDT, several methods have been then proposed to solve this problem."

7. "The accomplishment of artemisinin and its derivatives in CDT has further encouraged the investigation of new kinds of peroxides to trigger ROS production in cancer."

8. "In conclusion, considering the low amount of endogenous H2O2 and the subsequent poor ROS production in conventional Fenton-based CDT, the use of LAHP as an exogenous ROS source can significantly increase the intratumoural ROS generation paving the way to the next generation of CDT."

9. "In conclusion, more feasible diagnostic modalities for monitoring the ROS levels in selected target sites into human body as the simplification of nanostructure construction represent pivotal technological and scientific issues for the successful development of ROS-generating nanoplatforms."

These excerpts highlight areas where the authors of the paper see potential for future research, improvements, and applications in the field of ROS-based cytotoxic therapies, including the need for better diagnostic tools, understanding mechanisms of action, and simplifying nanostructure construction for clinical translation.
