    "abstractText": "The Asteraceae family is a promising source of bioactive compounds, such as the famous Asteraceae plants Tanacetum cinerariifolium (pyrethrin) and Artemisia annua (artemisinin). As a result of our series of phytochemical studies of the subtropical plants, two novel sesquiterpenes, named crossoseamines A and B in this study (1 and 2, respectively), one undescribed coumarin-glucoside (3), and eighteen known compounds (4\u201321) were isolated from the aerial part of Crossostephium chinense (Asteraceae). The structures of isolated compounds were elucidated by spectroscopic methods, including 1D and 2D NMR experiments (1H, 13C, DEPT, COSY, HSQC, HMBC, and NOESY), IR spectrum, circular dichroism spectrum (CD), and high-resolution electrospray ionization\u2013mass spectrometry (HR-ESI\u2013MS). All isolated compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxic activities against Leishmania major, Plasmodium falciparum, Trypanosoma brucei (gambiense and rhodesiense), and human lung cancer cell line A549 because of the high demand for the discovery of new drug leads to overcome the present side effects and emerging drug-resistant strains. As a result, the new compounds (1 and 2) showed significant activities against A549 (IC50, 1: 3.3\u00b1 0.3; 2: 12.3\u00b1 1.0 \u03bcg/mL), L. major (IC50, 1: 6.9\u00b1 0.6; 2: 24.9\u00b1 2.2 \u03bcg/mL), and P. falciparum (IC50, 1: 12.1 \u00b1 1.1; 2: 15.6 \u00b1 1.2 \u03bcg/mL).",

            "text": "Crossostephium chinense (Asteraceae) is an evergreen shrub distributed in Japan, China, and other Asian countries. The shrub naturally grows on coastal raised coral reefs and can reach 10\u201340 cm in height. From November to December, the racemes are borne on the terminal branches and bloom tiny yellow flowers. C. chinense is widely planted as an ornamental shrub in China because of the high rate of survival for artificial cultivation [1]. The whole plants of C. chinense are traditionally used for the treatment of diabetes and arthritis in southward China [2]. The extract has been reported to have various activities, such as preventing the progression of restenosis [3], inhibiting differentiation, formation and bone resorptive abilities of osteoclasts [4], and larvicidal activity [5]. Flavonoids [6,7], coumarin [2,8], sesquiterpene [2], and triterpenoid [9] have previously been isolated from C. chinense; however, the phytochemical analysis is still insufficient, and a detailed evaluation of biological activities, especially for anticancer and antiparasitic activities, has yet to be conducted.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4696. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28124696 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4696 2 of 15\nCancer is a leading cause of death, especially in industrialized countries, and lung cancer causes the most deaths worldwide [10]. A549 is a cell line derived from human lung cancer and is frequently used in anticancer drug screening. Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by protozoan parasites which are transmitted by the bite of infected phlebotomine sandflies. Some 1.5\u20132 million new cases occur annually [11], and emerging drug-resistant strains attract much attention for developing new chemical agents. Leishmania major is associated with cutaneous leishmaniasis, the most common form of leishmaniasis. Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and T. brucei rhodesiense are the pathogens responsible for West and East African trypanosomiasis, also called sleeping sickness, respectively. Severe side effects and emerging resistant strains for the present clinical drugs have been reported [12,13]. Plasmodium falciparum is a unicellular protozoan parasite of humans and causes the most dangerous malaria, with a high risk of complication and mortality. According to the WHO malaria report of 2021, there were 247 million cases of malaria worldwide in 2021, resulting in an estimated 619,000 deaths. Artemisinin is a famous discovery from Artemisia annua, which belongs to the Asteraceae family and has saved millions of lives. However, artemisinin-resistant strains have been reported from southeastern Asia and Africa [14,15]. Our group focuses on the discovery of new bioactive compounds against these intractable diseases from natural resources. Asteraceae plants were one of the rich sources of bioactive compounds, such as pyrethrin from Tanacetum cinerariifolium and artemisinin from A. anua. Therefore, we are interested in an Asteraceae plant, C. chinense, to discover anticancer and antiparasitic constituents in this study. The ethyl acetate soluble fraction from the aerial part of C. chinense was phytochemically studied, and all isolated compounds were investigated for their cytotoxic activities against human protozoan pathogens, L. major, P. falciparum, and T. brucei (gambiense and rhodesiense) and also against a human lung cancer cell line, A549. As a result, two novel sesquiterpene-amino acid conjugates (1 and 2) and one previously undescribed coumaringlucoside (3) were discovered, of which two sesquiterpene-amino acid conjugates showed significant cytotoxic activity. Among the known compounds identified (4\u201321), the antiTrypanosoma activity of 14 and anti-Plasmodium activity of compounds 1, 2, 11, and 14 are reported for the first time. Although the anti-Trypanosoma activity of compounds 6\u20139 and 18 and the anti-Plasmodium activity of compounds 6\u20139, 12, 13, 15, and 18 have been previously reported, we tested these compounds using our experimental conditions to allow a direct comparison with the activities of 1 and 2 [16\u201327]."

The IR spectrum showed the absorption signals at 3411, 1762, and 1710 cm\u22121 due to hydroxy and carbonyl functions, of which 1762 cm\u22121 suggested a \u03b3-lactone functional group. 13C NMR showed that of the eight indices of hydrogen deficiency, four were ascribed to one double bond (\u03b4C 125.2 and 130.0) and three carbonyl carbons (\u03b4C 212.9, 177.0, and 173.9) (Table 1). In addition, the spectra also displayed one oxymethine (\u03b4C 80.8), one aminomethine (\u03b4C 66.6), two methines (\u03b4C 48.5 and 44.2), one quaternary carbon (\u03b4C 48.4), and two methyl carbons (\u03b4C 19.4 and 23.0). The 1H-NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed a tertiary methyl, \u03b4H 1.25 (3H, s, H3-14), and a vinyl methyl, \u03b4H 1.86 (3H, br s, H3-15).

HPLC analysis with an optical rotation detector revealed that acid hydrolysis of 3 with 1M HCl at 80 \u25e6C released D-glucose. The results of 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR (Table 2) were similar to those published for 6\u2032-O-sinapinoyl esculin, and indidenes F [48,49] (Table S1). The 1H-NMR spectrum showed several downfield doublets at \u03b4H 6.32 (1H, d, J = 9.5 Hz, H-3), \u03b4H 7.65 (1H, d, J = 9.5 Hz, H-4), \u03b4H 6.69 (1H, d, J = 15.9 Hz, H-8\u201d), and \u03b4H 7.92 (1H, d, J = 15.9 Hz, H-7\u201d), corresponding to cisand trans-double bonds, respectively. Moreover, several characteristic low-field signals at \u03b4H 7.31 (1H, d, J = 8.3 Hz, H-5\u201d), \u03b4H 7.570 (1H, d, J = 1.8 Hz, H-2\u201d), and \u03b4H 7.27 (1H, dd, J = 8.3, 1.8 Hz, H-6\u201d) were ascribed to a 1,3,4-trisubstituted benzene ring. In the 13C-NMR spectrum, two carbonyl carbons (\u03b4C 161.6 and 167.9), seven downfield quaternary carbons (\u03b4C 113.5, 127.1, 147.4, 147.8, 149.8, 150.8, and 151.5), one methoxy carbon (\u03b4C 56.5), five oxymethine carbons (\u03b4C 102.3, 78.7, 76.1, 74.9, and 71.6), and one oxymethylene carbon (\u03b4C 64.6), corresponding to D-glucose, were observed. HMBC correlations (Figure 6) from H-3 and H-4 to C-2; from H-3 to C-4a; from H-4 to C-8a and C-5; from H-5 (\u03b4H 7.01, 1H, s) to C-6 and C-8a; and from H-8 (\u03b4H 7.568, 1H, s) to C-4a, C-6, and C-7 indicated a coumarin moiety.

HPLC analysis with an optical rotation detector revealed that acid hydrolysis of 3 with 1M HCl at 80 \u00b0C released D-glucose. The results of 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR (Table 2) were similar to those published for 6\u2032-O-sinapinoyl esculin, and indidenes F [48,49] (Table S1). The 1H-NMR spectrum showed several downfield doublets at \u03b4H 6.32 (1H, d, J = 9.5 Hz, H-3), \u03b4H 7.65 (1H, d, J = 9.5 Hz, H-4), \u03b4H 6.69 (1H, d, J = 15.9 Hz, H-8\u2033), and \u03b4H 7.92 (1H, d, J = 15.9 Hz, H-7\u2033), corresponding to is- and tran -double bonds, r sp ctively. Moreover, several characteristic low-field signals at \u03b4H 7.31 (1H, d, J = 8.3 Hz, H-5\u2033), \u03b4H 7.570 (1H, d, J = 1.8 Hz, H2\u2033), and \u03b4H 7.27 (1H, dd, J = 8.3, 1.8 Hz, H-6\u2033) were ascribed to a 1,3,4-trisubstituted benzene\nring. In the 13C-NMR spectrum, two carbonyl carbons (\u03b4C 161.6 and 167.9), seven down-\nfield quaternary carbons (\u03b4C 113.5, 127,1, 147.4, 147.8, 149.8, 150.8, and 151.5), one methoxy carbon (\u03b4C 56.5), five oxymethine carbons (\u03b4C 102.3, 78.7, 76.1, 74.9, and 71.6), and one oxymethylene carbon (\u03b4C 64.6), corresponding to D-glucose, were observed. HMBC correlations (Figure 6) from H-3 and H-4 to C-2; from H-3 to C-4a; from H-4 to C-8a and C-5; from H-5 (\u03b4H 7.01, 1H, s) to C-6 and C-8a; and from H-8 (\u03b4H 7.568, 1H, s) to C-4a, C-6, and C-7 indicated a coumarin moiety. Moreover, HMBC correlations from H-7\u2033 and H-8\u2033 to C-9\u2033; from H-8\u2033 to C-1\u2033; and from H-7\u2033 to C-2\u2033 and C-6\u2033, together with the characteristic 1,3,4-trisubstituted benzene coupling pattern of H-2\u2033, H-5\u2033, and H-6\u2033, indicated the presence of a caffeoyl group.

            "text": "The plausible biosynthetic pathway of crossoseamines A and B (1 and 2) is the Mi-\nchael-type reaction of the nitrogen of proline to the eudesmanolide moiety (Figure 7). Yoshikawa et al. (1993) have reported a chemical synthesis of similar proline conjugates by the reaction of \u03b1-methylene \u03b3-lactone type eudesmanolide and proline with Et3N at 90 \u00b0C [50]. The demand for a relatively strong base and high temperature for chemical synthesis indicates the involvement of the biosynthetic enzyme to form 1 and 2 in C. chinense, not as artifacts through the extraction and purification processes. The 6,7-dihydroxy coumarin moiety of 3 is thought to be the lactone form of caffeic acid, i.e., esculetin, which undergoes further methylation, glycosylation, and caffeoylation to 3. Given the other isolated compounds having caffeoyl function, C. chinense is considered a rich source of caffeic acid and its derivatives."

In brief, the human lung cancer cell line A549 was maintained in 10% FCS-supplemented DMEM. Various concentrations of samples in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and A549 (5 \u00d7 103 cells/well) were cultured in a CO2 incubator for 72 h. The medium was replaced with 100 \u00b5L of MTT solution and incubated for 1.5 h in the same condition. The viability was calculated from the absorbance of formed MTT formazan at 550 nm using a microplate reader [52]. Etoposide was used as a positive control. The leishmanicidal activities of the isolated compounds were also evaluated using an MTT assay. In a 96-well plate, various concentrations of sample solutions in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and L. major (2\u00d7 105 parasite/well) in 100 \u00b5L of M199 medium were incubated for 72 h at 25 \u25e6C. Then, 100 \u00b5L of MTT solution was replaced and incubated overnight. The absorbance of the formazan solution in DMSO was recorded using a microplate reader at 550 nm [11]. Miltefosine was used as a positive control. The trypanocidal activities of the isolated compounds were performed in 96-well plates with slight modifications [53].

            "text": "The ethyl acetate extract of C. chinense was intensively fractionated to obtain previously undescribed sesquiterpene-amino acid conjugate crossoseamines A and B (1 and 2) and a coumarin glucoside, 6\u2032-O-caffeoyl scopolin (3) together with 18 known compounds (4\u201321). The plausible biosynthetic pathway of crossoseamines A and B (1 and 2) is the Michael-type reaction of the nitrogen of proline to the eudesmanolide moiety (Figure 7). Crossoseamine A (1) showed potent activity against A549 and L. major, while the introduction of the hydroxy function on position 8 (crossoseamine B (2)) decreased the activity. The polarity and/or functionality of eudesmane moiety may be necessary for the cytotoxicity against these targets. Among the evaluated compounds, chrysosplenol D (6) showed substantial toxicity for all tested organisms, probably by general toxicity, and has already been reported previously [21,25,56]. While some flavonoids (7\u20139) and caffeic acid derivatives (14) are relatively specific for both Trypanosoma and Plasmodium, compounds (11\u201313, 15, 18) showed specificity for Plasmodium. As a result, these compounds have the potential to treat human cancer, leishmaniasis, malaria, and trypanosomiasis. However, further chemical modification and mechanism analyses are needed in the future.\nSupplementary Materials: The following are available online at https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ molecules28124696/s1, Figures S1\u2013S32: 1D, 2D NMR spectra, MS and CD data of compounds 1\u20133.
