    "abstractText": "This article presents a quantitative structure\u2013activity relationship (QSAR) approach for predicting the acid dissociation constant (pKa ) of nitrogenous compounds, including those within supramolecular complexes based on cucurbiturils. The model combines low-cost quantum mechanical calculations with QSAR methodology and linear regressions to achieve accurate predictions for a broad range of nitrogen-containing compounds. The model was developed using a diverse dataset of 130 nitrogenous compounds and exhibits excellent predictive performance, with a high coefficient of determination (R ) of 0.9905, low standard error (s) of 0.3066, and high Fisher statistic (F) of 2142. The model outperforms existing methods, such as Chemaxon software and previous studies, in terms of accuracy and its ability to handle heterogeneous datasets. External validation on pharmaceutical ingredients, dyes, and supramolecular complexes based on cucurbiturils confirms the reliability of the model. To enhance usability, a script-like tool has been developed, providing a streamlined process for users to access the model. This study represents a significant advancement in pKa prediction, offering valuable insights for drug design and supramolecular system optimization.",

            "text": "The concepts of acidity and basicity are fundamental to the understanding of chemistry and have been defined by various theories throughout history [2, 18, 19, 54, 55]. One such theory was introduced by Svante Arrhenius in 1887 [2], who suggested that certain compounds can dissociate into ions in solution and identified acids as those that yield a proton (H+ ) and bases as those that yield a hydroxide ion (OH\u2212 ). Another influential theory, the General Acid\u2013Base Theory of Br\u00f6nsted and Lowry [18, 19, 55], emerged in 1923, defining acidity and basicity in terms of the tendency to donate or accept a H +.\nUnderstanding the strength of a base is crucial in comprehending its behavior and acidity plays a pivotal role in this regard. The strength of a base is commonly expressed by considering the strength of its conjugated acid, with a weaker conjugated acid indicating a stronger base. The acidity constant (Ka ), which represents the equilibrium constant for the reaction between the acid and water, is used to quantitatively assess the strength of a base. For practical purposes, the pKa value, defined as the negative logarithm of the K a , is commonly employed [40]. The pKa value is an essential tool that serves as an indicator of the relative acidity or basicity of a compound and enables predictions of its protonation state or protomeric forms under different pH conditions [40]. Therefore, accurate determination of pKa holds immense significance across diverse fields, including medicinal chemistry [22, 29, 41, 60], biochemistry [11, 23, 62, 68], environmental science\n[12, 15, 48, 50], chemistry of dyes [44, 65, 93] and supramolecular chemistry [10, 56, 88].\nRecent research has focused on the phenomenon of supramolecular pKa shift, which involves a significant shift in the pKa value of nitrogenous compounds by forming supramolecular complexes with macrocyclic molecules such as cucurbiturils [7, 8, 14, 59, 64, 95]. This phenomenon is crucial for designing and optimizing supramolecular systems, with far-reaching implications in materials science [92, 98], catalysis [3, 28, 77] and the development of drugs and their delivery methods [26, 31,"

            "text": "In the pharmaceutical industry, accurate pKa values play a critical role in the design process of new drugs, as the acid/base character of a substance defines its biopharmaceutical properties, which have a direct impact on the pharmaceutical formulation of the drug [60, 61]. Nitrogen-containing heterocycles are of particular interest in the pharmaceutical industry due to their diverse biological activities [52, 53], with over 75% of FDA-approved drugs containing such structures [47]. The pKa values of these heterocycles provide information on the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) of the drug, which are crucial for the design process. Poor ADMET properties have been revealed as the cause for high attrition in the development phase [84].\nExperimental methodologies for pKa determination have been extensively reviewed [74], but there are\nstill samples that are difficult or impossible to measure accurately. To overcome this challenge, computational approaches have emerged as a promising alternative, as they can simulate virtually any set of working conditions without requiring physical samples [81, 83, 94]. Consequently, significant efforts have been directed toward developing accurate and reliable computational methods for predicting pKa values.\nAmong the most common computational approaches are First Principles and quantitative structure\u2013activity relationship (QSAR) methods [81]. However, the accuracy of First Principles calculations in predicting pKa values relies heavily on the precise determination of the Gibbs free energy difference in solution, which poses a significant challenge [27, 73, 81]. This is mainly due to the difficulty in calculating the Gibbs free energy of the proton and solvation energies, which can lead to deviations in pKa values of up to 3 units [13, 73]. One way to address these systematic errors is by using the relative pKa approach [73, 81], which has demonstrated high accuracy and effectiveness in various solvents [83]. Nevertheless, this approach is limited by the availability of accurate pKa values for reference systems with structural similarity to the sample.\nQSAR is a time-efficient and computationally less costly approach that predicts physical properties by constructing a multiple linear regression equation for a specific physical property as a function (P) of the selected molecular descriptors ( Xi ). The equation, represented as Eq.\u00a01, assigns numerical coefficients ( ai ) to each molecular descriptor, which serve as weighting factors to determine the respective contributions of the predictor variables [25, 81].\nAlthough QSAR models are less costly than First Principles, traditional QSAR methods have been hindered by lengthy calculation times, especially when quantummechanical electronic descriptors are involved, particularly in large molecules. As a result, the prediction of pKa has been impractical. However, the B97-3c method, based on density functional theory (DFT), has recently emerged as a reliable and low-cost solution [16]. This method effectively reduces computational time, thereby presenting a viable option for predicting pKa values in large molecules and supramolecular complexes.\nQSAR models have extensively employed a wide range of descriptors to predict crucial properties, including pKa values [36, 42, 45, 46, 70, 76, 79, 81, 90]. Some of these descriptors include charge [39, 45, 79], electronic energy differences ( E) [5, 6, 42, 79, 97], and the highest occupied molecular orbital energy ( \u01ebHOMO ) [80, 86]. Despite the flexibility in choosing chemical descriptors and their\n(1)P = a0 + a1X1 + a2X2\ncombinations, reported QSAR models are limited to specific datasets or structures, resulting in varying levels of accuracy and model performance across different subsets of data. Such is the case of QSAR models for predicting pKa values [96], which show diminished accuracy when predicting pKa of basic compounds such as nitrogenous compounds [78]. These discrepancies may arise due to the lack of appropriate relationship or representation between the selected descriptors and the structural diversity present in the complete dataset. Consequently, developing reliable QSAR models for predicting pKa values in heterogeneous datasets has proven to be a persistent challenge. To improve the generalizability of QSAR models and achieve higher precision in predicting pKa values, a more careful selection of chemical descriptors that effectively capture the structural variability within the entire dataset is necessary. This may involve the use of more specific descriptors or advanced variable selection methods.\nThe present incapacity to efficiently and accurately predict basic pKa values from heterogeneous data highlights the need for enhanced QSAR methodologies capable of achieving high accuracy regardless of the size and structure of the compound, as well as its inclusion in supramolecular host-guest systems. In light of this challenge, we propose and validate a comprehensive QSAR approach that utilizes the B97-3C low-cost density functional theory to predict the basic pKa values of nitrogencontaining compounds in aqueous solution at 25 \u25e6 C, both independently and within cucurbituril-based supramolecular complexes. This proposed approach represents a significant advancement toward predicting pKa shifts in supramolecular systems."

The robustness of the model is further supported by a high Fisher statistic (F) of 2141.9289 and a relatively low standard error (s) of 0.3066. The root mean squared error (RMSE), 0.2982, and mean absolute error (MAE), 0.2440, provide additional evidence of the predictive accuracy of the model.\nOur model (Eq.\u00a0 2) includes a variety of descriptors calculated in a vacuum environment and demonstrates remarkable performance when applied to a diverse set of nitrogenous compounds. The descriptors included in the model are the following:\n\u2022 Energy of deprotonation ( E) in kcal/mol: this descriptor measures the energy required to remove a proton from an acid. A higher E value signifies that a greater amount of energy is needed to carry out the deprotonation, which results in a higher pKa value. \u2022 HOMO\u2013LUMO gap of deprotonation ( HLGap ) in eV: this descriptor represents the change of energy gap between the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied orbitals of the acid\u2013base equilibrium. A higher HLGap suggests a less reactive base, hence a lower pKa value. \u2022 Mulliken electronegativity ( \u03c7M ) in eV: this descriptor quantifies the ability of the base to donate a pair of electrons and accept a proton. A lower \u03c7M indicates a higher basicity, which contributes to a higher pKa value. \u2022 Nonpolar surface area percentage ( %NPSA) of the base: this descriptor measures hydrophobicity and its influence on the solubility of the base in water. Bases with a higher %NPSA tend to have lower solubility, which leads to increased stability of the conjugated acid in a polar environment compared to the base. This reduced solubility directly affects the ability of the base to donate and accept protons, thus altering the acid\u2013base equilibrium and resulting in an increase in the pKa value. Notably, the % NPSA descriptor demonstrates one of the most significant individual correlations with the experimental pKa values, as evidenced by its correlation coefficient (r) of 0.7514 (refer to Additional file\u00a0 1: Table\u00a0S1).\n\u2022 Change in average local ionization energy ( ALIEN ): this descriptor quantifies the energy difference (in eV) required to remove an electron from\n(2)pKa = 0.1074\ufffdE \u2212 0.1422\ufffdHLGap \u2212 0.9132\u03c7M + 0.0151%NPSA\u2212 1.4887\ufffdALIEN + 3.0608BaseT \u2212 30.7139 n = 130;R2 = 0.9905; s = 0.3066; F = 2141.9289;RMSE = 0.2982;MAE = 0.2440\nthe nitrogen atom in the acid\u2013base reaction center. A smaller ALIEN indicates greater stabilization of the positive charge in the acid, leading to an increased pKa value \u2022 Base type (BaseT): this categorical descriptor takes a value of 0 for aromatic amines and 1 for aliphatic or non-aromatic amines.\nBy considering such a comprehensive range of independent parameters (with a correlation between parameters \u2264 |0.7744|, see Additional file\u00a0 1: Table\u00a0 S2), our model provides valuable insights into the electronic structure, stability, solubility, hydrophobicity, and local electronic effects during proton transfer in the bases under investigation. This holistic approach contributes to the accurate prediction of pKa values and enhances our understanding of the underlying factors governing acid\u2013base behavior in nitrogenous compounds.\nIn comparison with the trading software Chemaxon, our model shows a higher R 2 (0.9905 versus 0.9583), lower s (0.3066 versus 0.6346), and lower RMSE and MAE (see Additional file\u00a01: Table\u00a0S3). These results demonstrate the superiority of the presented approach over the widely used Chemaxon software.\nRegarding the comparison of our model with the QSAR studies previously reported [36, 42, 45, 76, 79, 90], it is necessary to note that our approach surpasses all the explored QSAR methods in terms of accuracy and versatility. Namely, Tehan\u2019s [90] semi-empirical method using AM1, Seybold\u2019s [79] method based on RM1, Jurani\u0107\u2019s [45] approach with PM6, Gross\u2019s [36] method using Hartree-Fock (HF)/6-311\u00a0 G(d,p), Sandoval-Lira\u2019s [76] DFT method based on \u03c9B97X-D/cc-pVDZ, and Holt\u2019s [42] approach with B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p). Except for Gross\u2019s [36] method, which performs similarly to ours for anilines, all methods reported lower R 2 values and higher standard errors (see Fig.\u00a01).\nWhile the cited works focused on a particular class of amines (non-heterogeneous data) and selected up to three parameters, we have expanded the predictive capabilities to a broader set of nitrogenous compounds by incorporating a comprehensive range of descriptors. This approach provides a more accurate estimation of the pKa value and greatly expands the range of applicability of our model.\nYu et\u00a0al. [96] presented a comparative performance of ACD and SPARC software. While the statistical results of both software are similar to those of the present work, it is important to note that these software are commercial\nand employ proprietary methodologies, which may limit their accessibility and customization. A key advantage of our model is its generalizability to diverse types of amines and its ability to handle heterogeneous data, which is a common challenge in real-world applications."

It is important to note that the 40 compounds in the external validation dataset are not part of the training dataset of 130 compounds. Additionally, our method was tested on 6 cucurbituril-based supramolecular complexes, which were not included in either of the two previous datasets. These results are summarized in Tables\u00a0 1 and 2, respectively.\nAccording to data in Table\u00a01, our model achieved a low external RMSE (RMSE_ext) of 0.32 and an external MAE (MAE_ext) of 0.28 when predicting pKa values for the external validation dataset of 40 pharmaceutical ingredients and dyes. Comparing these values with the corresponding metrics obtained from Chemaxon (RMSE_ext of 1.09 and a MAE_ext of 0.79), it is evident that our model outperforms Chemaxon in terms of accuracy and precision in predicting pKa values, especially when\nestimating pKa for supramolecular complexes, for which Chemaxon is currently incompatible.\nFor the dataset of 6 cucurbituril-based supramolecular complexes (Table\u00a0 2), our model exhibited a slightly higher RMSE_ext of 0.54, indicating a moderate average deviation of the predicted pKa values for this dataset. Similarly, the MAE_ext value of 0.42 suggests a moderate average error of the estimated pKa values for the supramolecular complexes."

Chemical descriptors can be local or global, depending on whether they are related to a specific atom or group of atoms within the molecule or to the molecule as a whole. However, obtaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic structure of a molecule and its acidity requires an advanced computational approach able to provide a detailed picture of the molecular parameters and properties relevant for predicting pKa values. In this section, we describe a comprehensive methodology for predicting basic pKa values of nitrogenous compounds.\nPrediction of\u00a0pKa values using chemical descriptors We employed a multi-faceted approach, using DFT as a fundamental computational method to determine electronic properties. DFT is widely used in quantum chemistry, since it is regarded as a reliable approach to predict molecular properties and structures [20].\nHowever, DFT alone may not provide a complete picture of the molecular electronic structure. Therefore, additional post-processing techniques were employed. CDFT [30] was used to obtain a broader perspective of the molecular electronic structure by making use of global and local descriptors based on the conceptualization of electron density. Moreover, MEDT [24] and quantitative analysis of the molecular surface [58] were used to obtain properties that account for the electronic distribution of the molecule.\nTo obtain a comprehensive set of chemical descriptors, a combination of DFT, CDFT, MEDT, and quantitative analyses of molecular surface was used. Subsequently, a predictive model for pKa values was developed, using a diverse set\na Calculated by Eq.\u00a02.

QSARINS is a powerful tool for identifying the molecular descriptors that contribute most significantly to the predictive power of the model. QSARINS uses iterative techniques to add or remove descriptors from a multivariable linear equation, based on their statistical significance, to create a set of models from which the most suited is selected. The performance of the selected model was evaluated by testing it on a set of 40 validation compounds, which were not part of the training set of 130 compounds. This set included pharmaceutical ingredients and dyes with known pKa values."

Protocol tightSCF was employed to ensure convergence. The total energy of the molecule was calculated, taking into account the Becke\u2013 Johnson dispersion damping (DFT-D3BJ) [34, 35] and short-range basis incompleteness SRB correction of the basis set [16, 87].

The HOMO and LUMO energies were automatically determined at the end of the electronic structure optimization in the previous step. Specifically, the HOMO and LUMO energies were obtained from the eigenvalues of the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals, respectively. Subsequently, the HOMO\u2013LUMO gap energy was calculated by subtracting the LUMO energy from the HOMO energy.\nThus, the variation of the HLGap in the deprotonation process of the conjugate acid was calculated as:"

The grid point spacing of 0.250000 was selected for generating the molecular surface, and the ratio of van der Waals radius was set to 1.7000 to extend the spatial region of cubic grids, which determines the size of the molecular surface by expanding the van der Waals radii of the atoms in the molecule.\nChange in\u00a0average local ionization energy at\u00a0nitrogen atom ( ALIEN) The reactivity of the acid\u2013base reaction center was investigated using the concept of Average Local Ionization Energy (ALIE) [71, 85].
