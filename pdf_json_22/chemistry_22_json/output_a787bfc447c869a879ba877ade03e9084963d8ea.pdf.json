    "abstractText": "Cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) is an important protein kinase that regulates cell growth, development, cell metabolism, inflammation, and apoptosis. Its overexpression is associated with reprogramming glucose metabolism through alternative pathways and apoptosis, which ultimately plays a significant role in cancer development. In the present study, we have investigated the structural and conformational changes in CDK6 at varying pH employing a multi-spectroscopic approach. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy revealed at extremely acidic conditions (pH 2.0\u20134.0), the secondary structure of CDK6 got significantly disrupted, leading to aggregates formation. These aggregates were further characterized by employing Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence. No significant secondary structural changes were observed over the alkaline pH range (pH 7.0\u201311.0). Further, fluorescence and UV spectroscopy revealed that the tertiary structure of CDK6 was disrupted under extremely acidic conditions, with slight alteration occurring in mild acidic conditions. The tertiary structure remains intact over the entire alkaline range. Additionally, enzyme assay provided an insight into the functional aspect of CDK at varying pH; CDK6 activity was optimal in the pH range of 7.0\u20138.0. This study will provide a platform that provides newer insights into the pHdependent dynamics and functional behavior of CDK6 in different CDK6 directed diseased conditions, viz. different types of cancers where changes in pH contribute to cancer development.",

Its overexpression is associ-\nated with reprogramming glucose metabolism through alternative pathways and apoptosis,\nwhich ultimately plays a significant role in cancer development. In the present study, we\nhave investigated the structural and conformational changes in CDK6 at varying pH employ-\ning a multi-spectroscopic approach. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy revealed at\nextremely acidic conditions (pH 2.0\u20134.0), the secondary structure of CDK6 got significantly\ndisrupted, leading to aggregates formation. These aggregates were further characterized by\nemploying Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence. No significant secondary structural changes\nwere observed over the alkaline pH range (pH 7.0\u201311.0). Further, fluorescence and UV\nspectroscopy revealed that the tertiary structure of CDK6 was disrupted under extremely\nacidic conditions, with slight alteration occurring in mild acidic conditions. The tertiary struc-\nture remains intact over the entire alkaline range. Additionally, enzyme assay provided an\ninsight into the functional aspect of CDK at varying pH; CDK6 activity was optimal in the pH\nrange of 7.0\u20138.0. This study will provide a platform that provides newer insights into the pH-\ndependent dynamics and functional behavior of CDK6 in different CDK6 directed diseased\nconditions, viz. different types of cancers where changes in pH contribute to cancer\ndevelopment."

In all cancers like colon, breast, lung, prostate, and stomach, the CDK6 expression level is very high, which signals cancerous cells to show resistance against the several drug molecules, chemotherapy and radiotherapy through continuous mutation [18].\nIn the last few decades, cancer cells show reprogramming of cellular and metabolic path-\nways. Several reports prove that the increased CDK6 level controls cell proliferation and alters the metabolic pathway of glucose consumption. CDK6 inhibits the Phosphofructokinase (PFK) and Protein Kinase (PK), key regulator enzymes of the glycolysis pathway. On the contrary, it activates the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and serine synthesis pathway that cause NADPH production and prevent ROS generation, which ultimately inhibits apoptosis [1, 19\u201323]. Evidence suggests that the alteration in the expression level of CDK6 involves cancer and is also found in neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson\u2019s [16, 24\u201326]. All these reports highlight the importance of CDK6 as a potential therapeutic target to cure several pathological conditions [26], ranging from cancer to neurodegenerative disorders [27, 28].\nThere are additional domains in CDKs apart from consensus kinase domains. For instance,\nCDK16, CDK17 and CDK18 comprise a conserved catalytic domain flanked by amino and carboxy-terminal extensions implicated in the binding of cyclins. CDK12 and CDK13 comprise a kinase domain in the center with additional Arg/Ser rich motifs in the amino terminus that serve as docking sites for splicing factors assemblage and as splicing regulators.\nCDKs belong to the CMGC group of kinases [29]. Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are\nserine/threonine protein kinase that controls the cell cycle [30]. CDKs and their cyclin strictly control every stage of the cell cycle by signaling checkpoints [31]. CDK6 gene is located on human chromosome 7q21.2, which encodes the 326 amino acids ~ 37 kDa cytosolic protein [32]. The human CDK6 structure is a single polypeptide chain that consists of N- terminal (amino-terminal) domain (5\u2013100 amino acids) and C-terminal (Carboxyl terminal) domain (101\u2013309). The N-terminal domain comprises five \u03b2 strands with one PLSTIRE \u03b1- helix. Cterminal domain comprises mainly of \u03b1- helix with a small \u03b2 sheet [33]. The all-inclusive structure of CDK6 is similar to CDK2 [34]. The catalytic site is present between both terminals. Cyclin-D interacts with amino-terminal and changes its structure, partially activating CDK6; CAK through phosphorylation/ dephosphorylation process at the specific site fully activated it [35, 36]. Several factors, including temperature, the strength of the buffer, pH, ions, macro and micro molecules present vicinity of the cell, is responsible for the function, proper folding and 3D structure of the protein [37\u201339]. Change in the ions concentration disturbs the pH homeostasis, leading to alteration of net charge on protein, ultimately affecting the protein function implicated in the diseased conditions [38]. It is apparent that any change in cellular pH, alters the cellular processes like cell growth, proliferation, and metabolic rate of cells; all these are hallmarks of cancer [40\u201342].\nCDK6 structure and its function are already well reported, but structural and functional\ncharacterization at different physiological pH conditions is unknown. Every protein shows its optimum activity at a particular pH. Thus, this study intends to delineate the effect of various pH conditions on the structure and function of CDK6 protein. We have successfully cloned, expressed and purified the CDK6 protein from the bacterial system.

CD spectroscopy is a sensitive technique routinely used to study changes in protein conformation under different pH conditions [48]. Native CDK6 showed spectral characteristics of a mixture of \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-sheet structures. The protein retained its native secondary structure in the pH range of 5.0\u20138.0, as revealed by the far-UV CD spectrum (Fig 1A). However, visible aggregates were observed in the pH range of 2.0\u20134.0 that interfered in CD spectra and hence almost no dichroic signal was obtained in this pH range. At pH 7.0\u20138.0, the protein attains a properly folded conformation evident from the far UV CD spectra obtained in this pH range.\nFig 1B shows far UV CD spectra of CDK6 in the alkaline range (pH 7.0\u201311.0).

Fig 1C shows the plot of [\u03b8]222 versus pH and depicts that no significant perturbation of secondary structure occurs at alkaline pH (7.0\u2013 11.0).

            "text": "Intrinsic fluorescence studies were carried out to see the effect of pH on the tertiary structure of irisin. Since intrinsic fluorescence of proteins depends on aromatic amino acid residues [49, 50], a change in intrinsic fluorescence is a sign of change in the local environment of aromatic amino acid residues. Thus, any structural perturbation that affects the microenvironment around the fluorophore is often reflected in terms of changes in the emission spectrum of the protein [51]. CDK6 possesses 8 Tyr and 3 Trp residues, and hence, we have investigated the effect of pH on the tertiary structure of CDK6 in terms of intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy. A characteristic redshift in the emission maxima is observed when a protein unfolds due to the increased solvent exposure of aromatic amino acid residues. Fluorescence emission spectra of CDK6 in the pH range (pH 2.0\u20138.0) are depicted in Fig 2A. CDK6 attains its native conformation in the pH range of 7.0\u20138.0, showing an emission maxima peak at 341 nm, as reported for other kinases [52]. A recently published study also reported that pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 3 (PDK3) and Sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) maintains their tertiary structure over the alkaline pH range [52, 53]. Another recently published literature reported that irisin, a myokine, maintains its structure in the alkaline pH range [39].\nIn the pH range of 5.0\u20136.0, there was no spectral shift in the emission maxima, suggestive of the fact that the environment around the aromatic amino acid residues was not perturbed to a significant extent. However, a decrease in fluorescence intensity was observed attributable to the protonation of water molecules or acidic amino acids surrounding Trp residues that act as dynamic quenchers of intrinsic fluorescence [54]. A spectral shift was obtained in the pH range of 2.0\u20134.0along with a decrease in the fluorescence intensity suggestive of the tertiary structural perturbations in this pH range. At pH 4.0, a decrease in the fluorescence intensity was coupled with a redshift of nearly 5nm, while at pH 2.0 and 3.0, visible aggregates were seen, and a blue shift of 3 nm and 6 nm was recorded, respectively. CDK6 maintains its native conformation at pH 5.0\u20138.0.\nFig 2B depicts the fluorescence emission spectra of CDK6 in the alkaline pH range (pH\n7.0\u201311.0). It is quite clear from the figure that CDK6 maintains its tertiary structure in the alkaline range (pH 7.0 to 11.0), attributable to no significant change in \u03bbmax across the alkaline range. However, there was an evident decrease in the fluorescence intensity beyond pH 9.0.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263693.g002\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263693 February 11, 2022 5 / 12\nThis decrease is attributable to the deprotonation of basic amino acids present in the vicinity of intrinsic fluorophores causing fluorescence quenching. Protonation/deprotonation of amino acid side chains may lead to charge destabilization in the local environment by disrupting the electrostatic interactions and internal salt bridges present in the native state [55]. The plot of \u03bbmax as a function of pH is depicted in Fig 2C; fluctuations were evident in \u03bbmax in the extreme acidic conditions, i.e., in the pH range of 2.0\u20134.0. In the pH range of 5.0\u20138.0, no significant change in the emission wavelength maxima was observed, suggesting no changes in the tertiary structure. However, a slight redshift of 2 nm was observed beyond pH 8.0. All these observations reveal that the tertiary structure of CDK6 is maintained in the alkaline pH range. In contrast, significant tertiary structural alterations occurred in the extreme acidic, with slight alterations occurring in the mild acidic conditions.\nTo further examine the effect of pH on the tertiary structure of CDK6, UV-vis spectroscopy\nwas employed (240\u2013340 nm). Conjugated double bond system present in the side chains of aromatic amino acids acts as a chromophore and absorbs light strongly in the UV region (240\u2013340 nm) [56]. Additionally, the microenvironment of the aromatic residues corresponds to changes in UV absorption maxima; increased solvent exposure causes a blue shift in \u03bbmax. Fig 3A shows the UV absorption spectra of CDK6 in the pH range (2.0\u20138.0). In the pH range of 5.0\u20138.0, nearly identical UV spectra were obtained, suggesting that minimal tertiary structural alterations occur and protein maintains its native-like conformation. In the pH range of 2.0\u20134.0, completely distorted UV spectra with a very high scattering were recorded. These distorted spectra suggest the distortion of the tertiary structure of CDK6 in the acidic conditions with subsequent aggregation. On the other hand, no significant changes were observed in the UV spectral profile of CDK6 across the alkaline range (pH 7.0\u201311.0), implying that CDK6 maintains its native-like conformation in the alkaline pH range.\nThese observations corroborate fluorescence and CD spectroscopy observations advocating\nthat CDK6 maintains its native-like conformation in the alkaline pH range. Under extreme acidic conditions, distortion in its tertiary structure occurs with subsequent aggregation."

Our earlier spectroscopic observations revealed that CDK6 maintains its native-like conformation over the alkaline pH range. Thus, this loss in enzymatic activity in this alkaline pH range can be attributed to the ionization states of active site residues, which further affect catalytic activity.
