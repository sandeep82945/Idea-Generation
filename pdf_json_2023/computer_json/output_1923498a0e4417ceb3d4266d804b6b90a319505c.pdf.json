    "abstractText": "The COVID-19 pandemic has caused drastic fluctuations in the economies of various countries. Meanwhile, the governments\u2019 ability to save the economy depends on how banks provide credit to troubled companies. Therefore, the impact of the epidemic on bank credit and inclusive finance are worth exploring. However, most of the existing studies focus on the reform of the financial and economic system, only paying attention to the theoretical mechanism analysis and effect adjustment, scant data support, and insufficient scheme landing. At the same time, with the rise and rapid development of artificial intelligence technology in recent years, all walks of life have introduced it into real scenes for multi-source heterogeneous big data analysis and decision-making assistance. Therefore, we first take the Chinese mainland as an example in this paper. By studying the impact of the epidemic on bank credit preference and the mechanism of inclusive finance, we can provide objective decision-making basis for the financial system in the post-epidemic era to better flow credit funds into various entities and form a new perspective for related research. Then, we put forward a model based on Bi-directional Long Short-term Memory Network (BiLSTM) and Attention Mechanism to predict the number of newly diagnosed cases during the COVID19 pandemic every day. It is not only suitable for COVID-19 pandemic data characterized by time series and nonlinearity, but also can adaptively select the most relevant input data by introducing an Attention Mechanism, which can solve the problems of huge calculation and inaccurate prediction results. Finally, through experiments and empirical research, we draw the following conclusions: (1) The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will promote enterprises to increase credit. (2) Banks provide more credit to large enterprises. (3) The epidemic has different impacts on credit in different regions, with the most significant one on central China. (4) Banks tend to provide more credit to manufacturing industries under the epidemic. (5) Digital inclusive finance plays a (positive) regulating effect on bank credit in COVID-19 pandemic. Inspired by the research results, policymakers can consider further solving the information asymmetry and strengthening the construction of a credit system, and more direct financial support policies for enterprises should be adopted. (6) By adopting the COVID-19 prediction model based on the BiLSTM-Attention network to accurately predict the epidemic situation in the COVID-19 pandemic, it can provide an important basis for the formulation of epidemic prevention and control policies.",

            "text": "The impact of the epidemic on bank credit and inclusive finance are worth exploring [1]. The problem of bank credit preference exists in various fields and groups, such as different genders [2], different races [3], and different enterprises. Financial institutions tend to provide lower-cost and\nmore convenient credit to large enterprises and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) [4]. Especially for various enterprise sizes, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) cannot provide commercial banks with sufficient information about their business and its potential risks and benefits, which makes discriminatory financing more serious, leading to limited financing channels and asymmetric information. Then, banks provide higher credit interest rates to SMEs, which increases the operating costs of SMEs and ultimately reduces their profitability [5].\nWith the change in epidemic severity, different degrees of disturbance will be inevitably brought to the normal\n* Beiqin Zhang beiqinzhang@163.com\n1 Cardiff, Business School, Cardiff University, 1-6 St Andrew\u2019s Place, Crown Place-112, Cardiff\u00a0CF10\u00a03BE, UK\nInternational Journal of Computational Intelligence Systems (2023) 16:159\n1 3\n159 Page 2 of 17\nproduction and operation of SMEs. These disturbances include but are not limited to the followings: (1) The increase in daily operating expenses: firstly, direct epidemic prevention expenses. Secondly, the labor cost, rising material price, and logistics cost, altogether result in the increasing material and labor expenses of enterprises, as well as the potential medical expenses in case of the epidemic in enterprises. (2) Due to the lacking of advantages in economies of scale and insufficient utilization rate of production capacity, the product cost per unit of SMEs is likely to increase greatly.\nMoreover, the impact of the epidemic on credit may not be limited to traditional research, such as spreading to regional differences and industry differences. Different regions are affected by the epidemic to various degrees due to economic development, population density, and other reasons, and then the credit demand of local enterprises fluctuates drastically. Different industries may also be affected by the epidemic to varying degrees due to different production methods.\nGiven that mainland China has relatively complete and rich data records compared to some other regions, it provides a solid foundation for in-depth analysis and modelbuilding. Additionally, as mainland China\u2019s financial system differs from other countries and regions, studying how its financial system responded to the COVID-19 crisis can offer insights for other nations. This paper takes mainland China as an example to study whether the COVID-19 pandemic can significantly stimulate bank credit and whether the stimulus effect is significantly diverse in different enterprise sizes, different regions, and different industries, so as to understand China\u2019s policy tendency in economic development. Secondly, the article also wants to explore whether the development of digital inclusive finance in the region can strengthen the stimulating effect of the epidemic on bank credit, and whether the more developed areas of digital inclusive finance will give more bank credit support to local enterprises during the epidemic. The research results provide objective decision-making basis for how to make the financial system better flow credit funds into various real economies.\nInclusive finance is defined as providing banking services to the widest class of society on affordable conditions, in contrast to the definition of financial exclusion, that is, \u201cspecific groups are unable, difficult, or unwilling to obtain or use mainstream financial services related to their needs, suitable for their needs, and allow them to live a normal life in the society to which they belong\u201d [6]. In particular, the State Council of China defines inclusive finance as providing appropriate and effective financial services to all social strata and groups with financial service needs at an affordable cost by increasing policy guidance and support, strengthening financial system construction, and improving financial infrastructure. The construction of this index helps to identify the\ncoverage of financial services for different groups, especially those that might be marginalized in the traditional financial system. Considering the trend of digitization, digital financial inclusion places more emphasis on leveraging digital technologies to enhance the ubiquity and accessibility of financial services. The relevance of digital financial inclusion to this study is manifested in three main areas\u2014firstly, in relation to COVID-19\u2014the pandemic could lead to interruptions or reduced accessibility of financial services, and digital financial inclusion might be a key means to maintain financial stability and support economic activities during the crisis. Secondly, in relation to business financing: the study explores how businesses obtained credit during the pandemic. The Digital Financial Inclusion Index provides a framework to assess whether bank credit decisions are biased towards certain businesses or regions, and if this is related to financial inclusivity. Lastly, in relation to financial policy: through the study of digital financial inclusion, governments and financial institutions can better understand which areas or communities have gaps in financial services, thereby adopting appropriate policies or measures to improve financial inclusion rates.\nThe current literature can be divided into five aspects according to keywords, specifically including: (1) bank credit preference from the perspective of enterprise scale, (2) the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy and bank credit, (3) the performance of inclusive finance in the epidemic situation, (4) the relationship between inclusive finance and bank credit, and (5) significant role of machine learning in practical applications\nMuch literature has made in-depth research on the credit discrimination of SMEs. They have found that banks will lend to companies with healthier finances and better governance [7]. The reason to explain this phenomenon is found. Because SMEs cannot provide commercial banks with sufficient information about their business and its potential risks and benefits, which makes discriminatory financing more serious, leading to limited financing channels and asymmetric information. Then, banks provide higher credit interest rates to SMEs, which increases the operating costs of SMEs and ultimately reduces their profitability [5]. In addition, it is found that owning a state-owned minority stake helps companies obtain bank loans, which shows that political relations still play a role in obtaining bank financing [8].\nSecondly, In the research on the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s influence on the economy, some researchers focus on the relationship between stock market returns and fluctuations [9], exchange rates [10], and insurance market development [11]. Some focus on the impact on real industries. Except for basic industries less affected by the epidemic, other industries are significantly affected by the epidemic and the costs of various industries have increased to varying degrees. For example, aviation, tourism, and other service industries have\nInternational Journal of Computational Intelligence Systems (2023) 16:159\n1 3\nPage 3 of 17 159\nsuffered great economic losses. However, the new infrastructure, ready-for-use traditional Chinese medicine, and Internet industries have made great progress [12]. There are also many related to the impact of the epidemic on bank credit. It is directly pointed out that confirmed cases have a significant positive impact on domestic credit [13]. It also interrupts the debtor\u2019s performance and ability to fulfill its credit obligations, which may disrupt the bank\u2019s performance in credit management [14]. Meanwhile, SMEs are facing increasing difficulties in raising funds, which has aroused great concern from various stakeholders such as public administration departments and regulatory agencies [15]. However, under the impact of the epidemic, the governments of many countries have provided strong support to local SMEs, avoiding a sharp decline in the output of related industries [16].\nMoreover, many studies believe that inclusive finance has played a greater role in various aspects of the epidemic impact. In terms of urban and rural income, inclusive finance is conducive to narrowing the gap between urban and rural per capita disposable income [17]. In terms of agricultural production, for every 1% increase in the inclusiveness of inclusive finance, agricultural trade increased by about 1.6% during the COVID-19 epidemic [18]. At the same time, inclusive finance has effectively promoted the sustainable development of green agriculture [19]. In terms of industrial structure, the development of inclusive finance has a positive role in promoting the upgrading of industrial structure and its promotion role has obvious regional heterogeneity [20]. Taking China as an example, the promotion of inclusive finance is most significant in eastern China, while there is still great room and potential for development in central and western China.\nWith regard to the research on the relationship between bank credit preference and inclusive finance, some scholars believe that credit preference inhibits the development of inclusive finance in the real economy to a certain extent. Bank credit has a significant bias in allocation, that is, it is more inclined to manufacturing enterprises with a higher scale of fixed assets, return on investment and financialization. In many countries, the borrowing capacity of local SOEs has improved more, which leads to an increase in the output share of SOEs and aggravates the uneven distribution of credit resources between local SOEs and private enterprises [21].\nFinally, machine learning and its associated technologies are rapidly expanding in real-world applications, profoundly influencing many sectors. In the FinTech domain, research on the relationship between imbalances in the population\u2019s gender ratio and FinTech innovation suggests that such imbalances may influence the advancements in financial technology [22]. Simultaneously, stock intelligent investment strategies using support vector machine parameter optimization algorithms have demonstrated the efficacy of\nmachine learning in stock market strategy development [23]. Moreover, the influence of clustered institutional investors and shared ESG preferences on low-carbon innovation in family businesses has garnered attention, emphasizing the potential value of data-driven technologies in business management and innovation [24]. Furthermore, in the medical manufacturing sector, the question of how China's listed companies can enhance their technological innovation efficiency has been spotlighted. Through an analysis based on a three-stage DEA model and corporate governance configurations, researchers have delved into the relationship between internal corporate governance and technological innovation efficiency [25]. In the realm of teleoperation systems, effective control of system tracking error has become paramount. By merging the terminal sliding mode control method with the neural network adaptive control method, a bilateral continuous finite-time adaptive terminal sliding mode control approach has been proposed, making the application of teleoperation systems more practical [26]. Additionally, an investigation into the anxiety levels among the teacher population in China during the COVID-19 pandemic has been conducted [27]. Although this research does not directly involve machine learning, it offers crucial context regarding the significance of data analysis and model predictions in global health crises.\nSummarily speaking, the existing literature rarely studies the impact of the epidemic on bank credit and the role played by inclusive finance. Considering the heterogeneity of how the epidemic impact on different enterprises, regions, industries, and the different development of inclusive finance in different regions, there may be both positive and negative impacts when it is influenced by the epidemic. The research on the size, direction, and influence mechanism behind this influence is of great benefit to better understanding the importance of how to make bank credit support the real economy and develop inclusive finance under the impact of the epidemic. Thus, it is a research with great academic value.\nThis paper fills the academic gap of existing research from two aspects. First of all, this paper specifically studies the scale differences, regional differences, and industry differences that affect bank credit enterprises during the COVID-19 pandemic. Different from previous studies, this paper further points out the difference between large enterprises and SMEs in obtaining bank credit against COVID19, with an emphasis on bank credit in different regions and industries.\nSecondly, this paper attempts to study the impact of digital inclusive finance on bank credit in a certain area during the epidemic. Inclusive finance is closely related to bank credit. The highly developed areas in inclusive finance often mean that financial institutions can provide more and lower-cost credit for local enterprises. However, there are\nInternational Journal of Computational Intelligence Systems (2023) 16:159\n1 3\n159 Page 4 of 17\nfew kinds of literature to study the role played by inclusive finance in the context of the epidemic, and this paper can be used as the starting point of this research.\nHypotheses Due to lockdowns and other restrictive measures, many businesses experienced a reduction in sales volume and a decline in revenue, leading to a tight cash flow. To maintain operations and cover fixed costs (such as salaries, rent, etc.), companies might seek external financing. On the other hand, the pandemic caused global supply chains to break, making it difficult for businesses to obtain raw materials or finished products. To bridge this gap, some businesses might need to increase short-term financing. These disruptions stimulate business credit demand. On the credit supply side, central banks might adopt a loose monetary policy, reducing interest rates to lower financing costs. Moreover, governments might introduce loan guarantee schemes to encourage banks to provide credit to businesses. Considering these facts, Hypothesis 1 is proposed.\nH1: the shock of the COVID-19 pandemic will promote enterprises to increase bank credit.\nThe financing of SMEs in emerging markets has always been the focus of a large amount of literature. However, there are few empirical studies to investigate the impact of the pandemic on SME financing [28]. Different enterprise sizes mean that the enterprise has different economic influences on the region. For example, large enterprises tend to bring more tax revenue and provide more employment opportunities to local areas, so banks may give priority to providing credit to larger enterprises. Secondly, large enterprises often get in touch with local government officials or bank executives and even directly or indirectly hold shares in banks, which makes government policies and bank credit favor them. Up against the epidemic, this phenomenon may be more significant, so Hypothesis 2 is put forward.\nH2: the larger the enterprise is, the larger scale of the credit service it will get from banks.\nThe composition of enterprises in different regions is different. There are different composition proportions of SOEs and private enterprises. The composition ratio of large enterprises and SMEs also exist, with respective characteristics of industry distribution. Will this regional structure difference have an impact on the credit scale of local companies? Moreover, different regions are affected by the epidemic in different orders and degrees, so the epidemic will have various impacts on credit preferences in different regions. For example, the epidemic first broke out in Wuhan. It is precisely because the city\u2019s economy has experienced an unprecedented crisis that banks will relax credit for local people to help them go through. After that, with the normalization of epidemic prevention measures, even if epidemics occur in other areas one after another, they can be relatively\ncontrollable, so the impact of the epidemic on credit may be marginally reduced. Based on this, Hypothesis 3 is proposed.\nH3: the epidemic has different credit stimulus effects on different regions, and the impact on central China is the most significant.\nThe epidemic will have a more direct impact on the service industry which accounts for the largest proportion in China\u2019s economy, so more loans should be given to the service industry. However, the service industry resumes production slowly, while the manufacturing industry has a higher contribution rate to economic growth after the outbreak. Cities with a high proportion of manufacturing industry recover faster and more efficiently after the epidemic. In addition, the epidemic indirectly promoted the transformation and upgrading of manufacturing enterprises, and they realized the importance of production automation combined with artificial intelligence, remote operation and maintenance, and other technologies. Therefore, lending to manufacturing enterprises has more priority for China\u2019s manufacturing industry to maintain competitiveness in the post-epidemic era. Therefore, hypothesis 4 is proposed.\nH4: banks tend to provide more credit for manufacturing during the epidemic.\nIn recent years, China has made great efforts to develop inclusive finance, especially since 2020. Facing the huge domestic and international challenges as well as severe business pressure brought by the COVID-19 epidemic, China\u2019s commercial banks have increased their credit supply to the real economy, supported the weak links of the real economy with credit supply, and effectively benefited the real economy. The Chinese government has implemented supporting policies for the development of inclusive finance, such as monetary and credit policies, differentiated regulatory policies, and fiscal and taxation policies, which have continuously expanded the business scale in inclusive finance of China and steadily declined the loan interest rate in inclusive finance. The highly developed areas in inclusive finance often mean that bank credit is developed and can provide more credit for local enterprises. We measure the development degree of inclusive finance in a region according to the digital inclusive finance index, and then H5 is put forward.\nH5: inclusive finance has a (positive) moderating effect in the COVID-19 pandemic on bank credit preference."

After excluding the samples with incomplete financial data and without COVID-19 infection in the quarter where the company samples are located, a total of 19,386 available samples were collected in this paper. The choice of Chinese listed companies as the sample for this study is primarily based on the reliability and completeness of the data: compared to non-listed companies, listed companies are required to adhere to stricter financial and non-financial information disclosure standards. This means that we can obtain reliable and detailed data from official and recognized sources. At the same time, Chinese listed companies cover a range of industries and sizes of businesses, making them conducive for analysis."

            "heading": "2.2 Variables",
            "text": "The main dependent variable (credit) of this paper is credit, which represents the total loans of a listed company in the current period disclosed in the quarterly report, that is, the sum of short-term loans and long-term loans in the current period. The reason for choosing the sum of short-term loans and long-term loans to measure bank credit is that these two accounting subjects are directly related to bank credit. In China, short-term and long-term loans of joint-stock enterprises are mainly loans from borrowers of financial institutions, such as loans obtained from specialized banks and commercial banks. In addition, it also includes money borrowed from financial enterprises such as financial companies and investment companies. It can explain the shortage of operating cash flow of the company to a certain extent. However, due to objective conditions, it is impossible to accurately identify which part of the total loans comes from traditional banks. Therefore, this paper assumes that all loans of listed companies come from traditional commercial banks, and financial institutions that issue loans are not distinguished in detail.\nThe core variable (infected) is the quarterly cumulative number of infected people at the prefecture level, and the epidemic severity in a certain area is measured by such a number. The statistical period is 2020Q1\u20132022Q2.\nIn addition, the enterprise scale in Model 2 is classified based on the average total market value of all company samples on the last trading day of each quarter. Large enterprises are larger than the average of the total market value, and SMEs are smaller than the average. The impact of the epidemic on bank credit is studied at the company scale. In fact, the Central Government of China has a clear definition\nof large, medium, and small enterprises, but there are different definition standards for different industries. Meanwhile, the indicators of enterprises are constantly changing with time, so it is difficult to distinguish the sample size in detail. Therefore, in this paper, the enterprise size is divided based on the quarter-end values of listed companies. In Model 3, according to the regional division of the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the Chinese mainland is divided into the eastern regions (Hebei, Beijing, Tianjin, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai, Fujian, Guangdong, Hainan, Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces), central regions (Shanxi, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui), and western regions (Inner Mongolia, Guangxi, Chongqing, Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Tibet, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, and Xinjiang). Although this division method is not a statistical standard, it is a division method formulated according to the actual needs of statistical work, so as to study the difference in bank credit affected by the epidemic in different regions. In Model 3, I selected typically listed companies in various industries and classified them into agriculture, manufacturing, and service industries according to their main businesses, apart from studying the differences in bank credit affected by the epidemic in different industries.\nIn the mechanism analysis, the adjustment variable (index) is introduced to refer to China\u2019s digital inclusive finance index at the prefecture level, which covers 337 prefecture cities in China and measures the development of locally digital inclusive finance, cited by a large amount of literature, such as [18]. Looking for the relationship between the multiplication term of the adjustment variable index, the core variable infected, and the dependent variable credit can help us observe how much adjustment effect index has in the process of infected affecting credit."

We use a BiLSTM network to reduce the computational cost and fully use the forward and backward data information. At the same time, an attention mechanism is introduced to solve the information overload, so as to improve computational efficiency and prediction accuracy. We use quarterly time, company financial data (credit), registered city location, and panel data of the digital inclusive finance index as independent variables to predict the quarterly cumulative number of infected people at the prefecture level. Specifically, the cumulative number of infected people is used to measure the epidemic severity in a certain area, with the statistical period from 2020Q1 to 2022Q2. In this paper, a COVID-19 epidemic based on BiLSTM is designed and an Attention mechanism\nInternational Journal of Computational Intelligence Systems (2023) 16:159\n1 3\n159 Page 6 of 17\nis introduced to solve information overload, so as to improve computational efficiency and prediction accuracy.\n(1) BiLSTM\nLSTM network is a variant of the cyclic neural network, which can learn the long-term dependency between time steps of sequence data. The core components of the LSTM network are the sequence input layer and the LSTM layer [38]. The sequence input layer inputs sequence or time series data into the network. LSTM layer learns the longterm correlation between time steps of sequence data. We use a many-to-one model to predict the data for each time step. One of the time steps is calculated as shown in Fig.\u00a01.\nThe output of the one-time step of the model is y(n) = f (u(n), u(n\u22121),\u2026 , u(1)) . Moreover, the output of LSTM network is closely related to the output of the previous time. It needs to remember the previous state so that the subsequent neural network can learn. It simulates the human brain with certain memory functions. In general, y(n) = h(n) is defaulted, where the specific details of the LSTM structure are shown in Fig.\u00a02.\nAs shown in Fig.\u00a02, we call structure A memory blocks, and each memory block mainly contains three gates of forgetting, input, output, and a memory cell (cell) [39]. The gate control unit adds and deletes information to the cell by using the structure as shown in Fig.\u00a03.\nIt represents a Sigmoid neural network layer. After the Sigmoid layer is combined with a multiplication operation, it can selectively decide whether the information passes or\nnot. The output of the Sigmoid layer is a number between 0 and 1, indicating how much information is allowed to pass, 0 denoting no passing at all, and 1 denoting full passing.\nAs shown in Fig.\u00a04, the first step of LSTM is to determine what information can be passed through the cell. This decision is controlled by the forgetting gate through Sigmoid, which selectively filters according to the output of the previous moment to prevent the current irrelevant content from entering the memory.\nAs can be seen from Fig.\u00a04, we input the current time input and the short-term state of the previous time into A. Through the forgetting gate, the calculation is as ft = ( Wf \u22c5 [ ht\u22121, xt ] + bf )\n. The second step is to generate new information that we need to update. This step consists of two parts. The first is an input layer to determine which values need to be updated through the Sigmoid layer, and the second is to use a tanh layer to generate new candidate values, as shown in Fig.\u00a05.\nThe combination of the first step with the second one is the process of throwing away unnecessary information and adding new information. One of their current output data is as Ct = ft \u2217 Ct\u22121 + it \u2217 C\u0303t.\nThe last step is to determine the output of the model. First, an initial output is obtained through the Sigmoid layer, so that neurons can decide whether to choose between the input value and the previous state. When the value is 0, it is discarded and when the value is 1, it is left behind. Then tanh is used to scale the obtained new long-term memory to between \u2212 1 and 1. Then, it is multiplied by the output obtained by Sigmoid, and the output is updated through the\nFig. 1 Many-to-One LSTM Model\nFig. 3 LSTM gate control unit\nInternational Journal of Computational Intelligence Systems (2023) 16:159\n1 3\nPage 7 of 17 159\nnewly obtained long-term memory to obtain the output of the model. The process is shown in Fig.\u00a06.\nht is the short-term memory for our current moment, which can also be used as the output data of the current moment. Its formula is as follows:\nThe output of the Sigmoid function is the output without considering the information learned at the previous time, while the tanh function is the compression processing of the information learned at the previous time, playing a role in stabilizing the numerical value. The combined learning of the two is the learning idea of LSTM [34, 35].\nIn the experiment, we use this basic network module and combine forward LSTM and backward LSTM into BiLSTM to build our epidemic prediction model for the COVID-19 epidemic.\n(2) Attention Mechanism\nIn an artificial neural network, with the increase of model parameters, the expression ability of the model will become stronger, and the amount of information in the model will become huge, which will bring information overload. Introducing an attention mechanism into the neural network\no t =\n(\nW o\n[\nh t\u22121, xt\n]\n+ b o\n)\n,\nh t = o t \u2217 tan h(C t ).\nmodel can allocate a series of weight parameters so that the model concentrates resources on key information and reduces the attention to low-correlation information, which can solve the information overload and improve the efficiency of the algorithm. The structure of the attention mechanism is shown in Fig.\u00a08.\nThe attention mechanism assigns weight parameters, that is, attention value, according to the importance of information. The calculation steps of attention value are as follows. Firstly, the attention distribution of input information is calculated to obtain an attention score function. Then, the attention score function is converted numerically by a normalized exponential function (softmax), and the weighted sum is carried out according to the weight coefficient. Attention function has several forms, including additive, bilinear, dot product, and scaled dot product models. The function of the attention function is to calculate the similarity between two vectors without fixed form. The above calculation methods are common. In practice, we should choose the model according to the specific task. In this paper, we choose the additive model. Finally, the probability of all the input information is summarized and summed in the way of a weighted average to get the attention value.\n(3) COVID-19 prediction method based on BiLSTM-attention\nConsidering the need for deep mining and the use of relevant information in the obtained statistical data of the COVID-19 epidemic, this paper adopts the structure of BiLSTM. However, when BiLSTM is used to extract information from limited time series data, it is easy to over-fit, which ultimately affects the prediction effect of the model. Therefore, the Dropout layer is added to the network. The same Dropout mask is used for each time step so that the network can correctly propagate learning errors over time. To some extent, Dropout avoids the excessive influence of some weights on the network model, reduces the deviation of the model, and avoids the over-fitting of complex neural network models. In addition, after the Dropout layer, the attention mechanism is used to distribute the weight of output information, focusing on useful information, so as to improve the prediction efficiency of the model. The network structure of BiLSTM-Attention is shown in Fig.\u00a09.\nThe growth of COVID-19 cases, influenced by governmental measures, public cooperation, and other factors, exhibits non-linearity. The amalgamation of the BiLSTM and the Attention Mechanism is adept at capturing and simulating these intricate non-linear relationships. The BiLSTMAttention model synergizes the time series analytical power of the BiLSTM with the data weight allocation capacities of the Attention Mechanism to forecast COVID-19 cases. To be specifically, LSTM, a specialized form of recursive neural\nInternational Journal of Computational Intelligence Systems (2023) 16:159\n1 3\n159 Page 8 of 17\nnetworks (RNN), excel at learning long-term dependencies. The bidirectional structure entails that the model, at each time point, incorporates information from both past and future states. This becomes paramount in predicting the dissemination of a disease like COVID-19, where the count of new cases might be influenced by both preceding and subsequent time points.\nHowever, conventional RNNs, LSTMs, or BiLSTMs treat every time step with equivalency. The Attention Mechanism, on the other hand, empowers the model to assign varying degrees of importance to different time points during predictions. In the context of COVID-19 transmission, data from certain dates (e.g., days with sudden outbreaks or mass testing) might hold more significance than others. The Attention Mechanism ensures that the model accords heightened emphasis to these pivotal dates during its forecasting. This implies that the model can selectively focus on time steps that are most influential for its predictions."

The high degree of inclusive finance in a certain region often means that the economic individuals in the region have more convenient access to credit, lower cost, and higher credit lines. Therefore, the development of inclusive finance in the region may be closely related to the stimulus degree of the epidemic to bank credit. Therefore, I hope to study the impact of the epidemic on bank credit by taking the digital inclusive finance index as the regulating variable in the process of the epidemic affecting bank credit. Index represents Digital Inclusive Finance index, index*infected is the multiplication term."

            "text": "The following table is the result of the panel random effect and panel fixed effect of hypothesis 1, which mainly studies whether the COVID-19 pandemic positively promotes bank credit.\nTable\u00a01 shows that the core variable infected in models (1) and (2) is significant at a 1% level, and its absolute value is 7409.65\u20139870.80, which shows that the average bank credit of local listed enterprises increases Fig. 7 BiLSTM\n1 3\nby 7400\u20139900 yuan for each additional infected person. After controlling the individual effect, although the absolute value of the infected coefficient in Model 2 is smaller than that in Model 1, it is still very significant. This proves\nhypothesis 1, that is, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will promote enterprises to increase bank credit.\nThe following table is the result of the panel random effect of hypothesis 2. Adding the enterprise scale (scale) as a dummy variable, the existing literature has found that bank credit has preference for an enterprise scale. Here, taking Chinese-listed companies as samples, we will further study the difference between the bank credit of SMEs and large enterprises.\nTable\u00a02 shows that the variables infected and Scale in the random effect model are significant at a 1% level, and the absolute values are 11,000 and 410,000,000. This shows that for each additional infected person in the local area, the average bank credit of local listed enterprises increased by 11,000 yuan, and the average difference between large enterprises and small enterprises in obtaining bank credit during the experimental period was 410,000,000 yuan. This also proves hypothesis 2, that is, the larger the enterprise, the larger the credit service it will get from banks. This hypothetical conclusion is also similar to the conclusion mentioned in [4], which holds that large enterprises and SOEs can usually get better political and economic ties with banks and markets, thus obtaining more and better credit facilities.\nThe following table is the result of the panel fixed effect of hypothesis 3. According to the registered places of listed companies, the samples are divided into eastern, central, and western regions for grouping tests, so as to study the differences in the impact of the epidemic on corporate bank credit at the regional level.\nInternational Journal of Computational Intelligence Systems (2023) 16:159\n159 Page 10 of 17\nTable\u00a03 shows that the core variables infected in Model 1 and Model 2 are significant, with significance levels of 5% and 1% respectively, and absolute values of 7230 and 1,000,000 respectively, which shows that the bank credit of listed companies in the central region increases by 992,770 yuan on average compared with that in the eastern region for each additional infected person. It is possibly because the infected coefficient in central China is much higher than that in eastern China. Firstly, the number of infected people in central China is less than that in eastern China. As of 2022Q2, only Wuhan in central China has exceeded 50,000. However, the infected people in eastern Shanghai exceeded 63,000, and the infected people in Beijing, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Hangzhou were also at the level of 2000\u20133000. Thus, the independent variable infected value was relatively larger. Secondly, as of 2022Q2, the proportion of small enterprises in central China was 500/721=0. 693, and that in eastern China was 2926/3588=0. 815. Therefore, the proportion of SMEs in the east is higher. Combined with the conclusion of hypothesis 2, it can be considered that the average bank credit obtained by listed companies in the east is less. Finally, thanks to the strategy of rising Central China since 2004 and the new development pattern strategy with the country implementing the domestic big cycle as the main body and the domestic and international double cycles promoting each other after the epidemic, investments have increased in the region with an important impact on\nthe regional differences of bank credit. To sum up, when the number of infected people increases by 1, the central region, where the proportion of large enterprises is higher, will get more marginal credit.\nThe following table is the result of the panel fixed effect of hypothesis 4. The listed enterprises with incomplete main business information or unclear classification of main business are excluded from all samples. Meanwhile, the remaining samples are classified into primary industry agriculture, secondary industry manufacturing, and tertiary industry service industry, so as to study the different impacts of the epidemic on bank credit at the industry level.\nChange Rate in the Period of 2019Q1\u20132022Q2 in the Whole GDP, Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Industry (Sourced from the National Bureau of Statistics of China)\nTable\u00a04 shows that the core variables infected in Model 2 and Model 3 are significant, with significant levels of 1% and 10% respectively, and absolute values of 9500 and 6280 respectively, indicating that for each newly infected person, listed companies in the secondary industry get an average of 3220 yuan more bank credit than listed companies in the tertiary industry. Agriculture is not significant. This is consistent with the research conclusion of [30] that capital-intensive SMEs with the most tangible assets (e.g., manufacturing) have relatively high bank loan borrowing.\nFrom the quarterly growth rate of GPD in different industries in Fig.\u00a012, it can be seen that the agricultural output\nDV Credit\nDV Credit\nInternational Journal of Computational Intelligence Systems (2023) 16:159\nPage 11 of 17 159\nvalue fluctuates little after the outbreak of the epidemic, and the production activities are stable. At the same time, the service output value fluctuates greatly, and the manufacturing output value is most affected. This is consistent with the influence coefficient of infection on different industries observed by us. Meanwhile, the areas greatly affected by the epidemic are mainly densely populated cities, so the epidemic has a greater impact on the secondary and tertiary industries concentrated in cities. More bank credit is needed to maintain the business development of enterprises. However, agricultural production is less affected by the epidemic, so it receives less additional support from bank credit.\nTo sum up, hypothesis 4 can be proved: banks tend to provide more credit for the manufacturing industry during the epidemic."

            "text": "In this paper, the stability of all models is tested by replacing dependent variables. From the perspective of accounting subjects, short-term and long-term loans are directly related to bank credit. However, under the background of diversified credit channels for enterprises, besides direct loans, the cash flow of enterprises can be alleviated by increasing advance receipts and payables. Therefore, I think the caliber of measuring credit can be appropriately relaxed to include advance receipts and payables. The total debt index refers to all debts undertaken and repaid by enterprises, including current liabilities, long-term liabilities, deferred taxes, etc.: (1) Current liabilities refer to the total debts that an enterprise needs to repay within one year or a business cycle exceeding one year, including short-term loans, payables, advances, wages payable, taxes payable, profits payable, etc. (2) Long-term liabilities refer to the total debts that an enterprise needs to repay for more than one year or more than one production cycle, including long-term loans, debts payable, long-term payables, etc. Therefore, I found the total liability data from 2019Q1 to 2022Q2 to replace the total loan as an\nexplanatory variable and put it into the above model. By studying the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on total liability and the differences in enterprise scale, region, and industry, the stability of the model can be tested well.\nTherefore, the dependent variable credit in all models is replaced by the total liability for the stability test, and other explanatory variables are consistent with the main model. The regression results are as the following figure.\nFirst of all, it is found in Table\u00a05 that the panel random effect and fixed effect of infected on liability are significantly positive at a 1% level, which indicates that with the increase in the number of people infected in COVID-19, the total liabilities of locally listed companies will also increase, that is, COVID-19 pandemic can significantly stimulate corporate liabilities. This result is consistent with the original model.\nAfter distinguishing the size of the company, the impact of the epidemic on the total liabilities of the company is also significant, with the results as follows (Table\u00a06).\nIt can inferred from Table\u00a06 that although it is only 5%, which is lower than the significant level of 1% in the original model, it can still show that the impact of the epidemic on the total liabilities of companies is different in different company sizes. It should be emphasized that the samples of this paper are listed companies in the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges of China. The samples of SMEs do not represent the whole picture in China. Therefore, the different impact of the epidemic on the total liabilities of companies of different company sizes can only be referred to.\nInternational Journal of Computational Intelligence Systems (2023) 16:159\n159 Page 12 of 17\nTable\u00a07 shows the stability test results after dividing regions. The influence of infected on the liability of eastern, central, and western regions is significant at a 1% level, while COVID-19 pandemic is only significant at a 1% level for enterprises in the central region in the original hypothesis. This may mean that the COVID-19 pandemic debt to enterprises is also strongly correlated, and there are no obvious regional differences. The reason may be that the main sources of supplementary cash flow of listed companies in different regions are different. For example, enterprises in the central region rely more on bank credit to supplement cash flow to maintain their operations and investment during the epidemic, while enterprises in the eastern and western regions less rely on direct bank credit to maintain the required cash flow. The specific reasons need further study.\nFor the difference in influence coefficient and significance level between the stability test and hypothesis 3 original model results, it is speculated that there may be the following three reasons: 1. During the epidemic period, different regions received different support from financial policies and financial institutions. For example, Wuhan, located in the central region of China, is a large city with an early outbreak. The state may give special credit support to enterprises in the whole central region represented by Wuhan. However, other regions are less affected by the epidemic, so the policy support is small. As shown in Table\u00a08, after excluding Wuhan from the central region and testing Wuhan separately, it is found that the impact coefficient of the epidemic on the total loans of listed companies in Wuhan is significantly greater than that of the central region as a whole and other regions of the country. 2. Compared with the central region, the eastern or western non-bank finance is developed, and the proportion of local enterprises financing through traditional commercial banks accounts for a relatively small proportion of total liabilities. 3. This paper takes Chinese listed companies as a sample, which may not fully represent the overall debt situation of Chinese enterprises.\nAfter dividing the company according to industry, the epidemic also has the most significant impact on the total\nliabilities of manufacturing enterprises. The results are shown in Table\u00a09.\nThis can be explained by the different characteristics of the three industries: 1. The vast majority of manufacturing industries are real industries, which have nothing to do with the degree of automation. They need the direct participation of manpower more or less, which cannot achieve the state that front-line employees are separated from the remote production of production tools. Therefore, the production value will inevitably decline during the epidemic, and the operating cash flow is more likely to fall into tension. Although the service industry is also facing the direct impact of the epidemic, many businesses can be flexibly transferred online for contactless services, such as the education industry. After the online school is closed, the education service can still be realized through distance education. Therefore, after facing short-term impacts, the service industry may be able to adjust the business model, quickly resume operations, and then supplement the operating cash flow. The agricultural production center itself is far away from the city and located in a township with low population density, so the production and operation are less affected by the epidemic. 2. Under the background of the social division of production, the production of manufacturing enterprises will always be affected by the whole industrial chain or supply chain. This means that although the production of some manufacturing enterprises\nDV Liability\nTable 8 Fixed-effect of H3 after dividing central region into two parts\nt statistics in parentheses *p < 0.1, **p < 0.05, ***p < 0.01\nDV Credit\nVariable Central Region without Wuhan Wuhan\nFixed-effect Fixed-effect\nInfected 3.4e + 05 (0.915) 3.3e + 06** (2.345) Control variables Y Y Individual effect Y Y N 2300 280\n1 3\nhas not been affected by the epidemic when their upstream or downstream are affected, there will be an insufficient supply of upstream products or reduced demand for downstream products, which will also affect the production and operation of the enterprises and a certain degree of financing is needed to relieve difficulties. For example, in the early stage of the Wuhan outbreak, the epidemic harmed non-Hubei SMEs with supply chain relationships in Hubei Province. This influence affects the whole supply chain, with a greater blow to SMEs mainly customers in Hubei [28]. 3. Taking China as a case has its particularity, and each country and region has different levels of Internet development. In China, where the Internet economy is highly popular, it may help the service industry to adjust its business model at a faster speed and reduce the impact of the epidemic as a whole."

            "text": "To study the moderating effect of inclusive finance on the bank credit process during the COVID-19 pandemic, the mechanism analysis is carried out by using Model 3, with the results as follows.\nTable\u00a010 shows that the core variable index*infected in the model is significant at a 1% level, and its absolute value is 556.54, indicating that a unit of regulatory variable has a positive regulatory effect of 556.54 on the impact of the cumulative number of infected people in the COVID-19 on the total bank credit of listed companies.\nThis proves hypothesis 5, that is, digital inclusive finance plays a (positive) moderating effect on COVID-19 pandemic influence on bank credit preference. The development of digital inclusive finance has significantly eased the financial constraints of SMEs [31].\nThe positive adjustment effect may be related to China\u2019s vigorous promotion of inclusive finance and implementation of relevant supporting policies in recent years. For example, the Chinese government has mainly implemented three supporting policies for the development of inclusive finance: 1. In terms of money and credit, it has implemented targeted cuts to required reserve ratios, improved the preferential deposit reserve ratio policy for various inclusive finance service institutions, played the transmission function of interest rates, and played the incentive and guiding role of macro-prudential tools. 2. Establish a differentiated regulatory index system. When commercial banks calculate the capital adequacy ratio, preferential risk weights are applied to small and micro-enterprise loans. Furthermore, the non-performing tolerance of small and micro-enterprise loans is appropriately improved. 3. In terms of fiscal and taxation policies, the loan interest of eligible small and micro enterprises of banks is exempted from VAT, and the loan contract is exempted from stamp duty.\nAs a result, the scale of business in inclusive finance has been expanding, and the loan interest rate in inclusive finance has been steadily declining. Taking financial support for SMEs as an example, the credit supply of Chinese financial institutions to SMEs has been increasing after the epidemic. By the end of 2021, the balance of Pratt & Whitney small and micro-loans increased by 27.3% yearon-year. In terms of changes in loan interest rates, as of the end of 2021, the weighted average interest rate of Chinese enterprise loans was 4.57%, down 0.04% year-on-year.\nAlthough taking China as a sample has its particularity, the case of inclusive finance in China can still remind us that developing inclusive finance can help economic individuals tide over the crisis better.\nt statistics in parentheses *p < 0.1, **p < 0.05, ***p < 0.01\nDV Liability\nVariable Agriculture Manufacturing Service\nFixed-effect Fixed-effect Fixed-effect\nInfected 2652.156 (0.128) 2.3e + 04*** (2.962) 2.0e + 04 (1.005) Control variables Y Y Y Individual effect Y Y Y N 585 8417 1469\nInternational Journal of Computational Intelligence Systems (2023) 16:159\n1 3\n159 Page 14 of 17"

            "text": "Previous studies have systematically revealed the differences between bank credit in enterprise-scale [32] and enterprise nature [8], confirmed the impact of the epidemic on bank credit [15], and affirmed the role of inclusive finance in promoting industrial upgrading [20] and export upgrading [33].\nBased on them, this paper makes the following two extensions. First of all, the results of this paper show that the COVID-19 pandemic significantly stimulates credit. However, the stimulus effect varies significantly in different enterprise sizes, different regions, and different industries. Under the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic, more credit flows to large enterprises, the central region of the Chinese mainland, and the manufacturing industry. Meanwhile, the degree of difference is initially shown, which reflects China\u2019s policy tendency in economic development and gives more bank credit resources to the central region and manufacturing industry. Although some literature points out that the credit demand of SMEs in Hubei Province has decreased significantly [28] after the outbreak, this seems to conflict with the conclusion of this paper. But it may be related to the period of observation, that is to say, the time elasticity of credit is different in the short term and the long term. When the epidemic broke out, the financial system and enterprises could not respond in time after the crisis broke out, which led to a sharp drop in credit demand. However, the economic order gradually recovered under the guidance of policies, and the recovery of corporate credit demand even required more credit than before the crisis to maintain operations. This can be used as an angle for further study.\nSecondly, the research results of this paper show that the development of inclusive finance in the region strengthens the stimulating effect of the epidemic on bank credit, which means that the more developed the digital inclusive finance,\nInternational Journal of Computational Intelligence Systems (2023) 16:159\n1 3\nPage 15 of 17 159\nthe more bank credit support will be given to local enterprises during the epidemic.\nThe results of this study offer an in-depth understanding of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on business financial needs and the lending preferences of financial institutions. These findings can be used to design more effective financial support policies. Firstly, it helps identify which business sectors or regions have been most affected by the pandemic, allowing governments and financial institutions to provide targeted support for these specific areas. Secondly, the study indicates that financial inclusion and innovative financial tools played a positive role during the pandemic. Policy makers can encourage financial institutions to continue innovating and offer training and technical support, educating businesses on how to effectively utilize financial resources. After the pandemic, businesses might need time to recover and adjust. The research findings can assist policy makers in considering the design of long-term financial support and regulatory strategies, normalizing mechanisms for responding to public crises.\nAfter comprehensive research and analysis, it is suggested that the problem of information asymmetry should be solved first, and a scientific credit system should be built [34]. We need to set up a professional organization to provide credit guarantees for SMEs, strengthen the normative role of administrative forces through the three-dimensional combination of laws, policies, and mechanisms, and then effectively play the financing role of the market through effective guidance and scientific management. In the process of construction, more digital technologies are used, such as the central bank\u2019s promotion of digital currency and the application of blockchain technology [35], so that the credit system covers more economic entities. When credit accurately flows to demanders, it further promotes the prosperity of inclusive finance. Secondly, current credit policies in many developing countries focus on reducing financing costs [36] and more direct support policies, such as zero-interest loans, subsidies, and grants could be considered [28]. Because SMEs face liquidity constraints in paying fixed fees such as wages and operating costs, they are unlikely to seek external financing due to a lack of sufficient collateral [37].\nHowever, while vigorously developing inclusive finance, we may need to consider the financial risks brought by inclusive finance. Because the attribute of inclusive finance objectively determines that the related financial business has higher risks, higher costs, and relatively low returns, inclusive finance risks mainly come from high-risk economic individuals, including SMEs and vulnerable groups, whose income is low and usually not fixed with poor repayment ability. The non-performing loan ratio of small and micro enterprises has always been higher than the average non-performing loan ratio of commercial banks. Taking China as an example, the non-performing loan ratio of rural commercial\nbanks was 3.63% at the end of 2021, which was much higher than the non-performing loan ratio of 1.90% of city commercial banks. While implementing the governmental inclusive finance policy, banks also have a great inhibitory effect on the profitability and growth of banks, affecting the fundamental situation and valuation of banks. This angle needs further in-depth study.\nFinally, there are still some limitations in this paper. First of all, the selected variables of the epidemic situation and bank credit may not completely and accurately describe the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and the credit obtained by listed companies from banks. Secondly, this paper selects Chinese listed companies as a sample of companies, listed companies may not be able to reflect the whole picture of Chinese enterprises, and the Chinese mainland as a research perspective has individual particularity, whether it is universally applicable needs further study. Nevertheless, the findings of this paper can still provide useful facts for followup research. Future studies could consider a diverse array of enterprises, such as SMEs, non-listed companies, and multinational corporations, to comprehensively understand the impact of COVID-19 on various types of businesses. Cross-country comparisons could also be pursued to shed light on the responses and challenges in different countries with varying financial systems and policy backgrounds. From the perspective of machine learning models, as new technologies and algorithms emerge, forthcoming research might explore different models to more precisely predict and analyze the changes in the pandemic and financial markets. Temporally, while this study mainly focuses on the initial impact of the outbreak, the effects might evolve over time. Longitudinal research would be valuable in revealing the long-term repercussions of the pandemic on the financial system.\nAuthor Contributions Beiqin Zhang completed the manuscript.\nFunding None.\nData Availability The datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\nDeclarations\nConflict of Interest The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.\nOpen Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.
