    "abstractText": "Potato peel waste (PPW) was utilized as a bio-template for the production of valuable compounds such as reducing sugars (RS), total sugar (TS) and total phenolic compounds (TPC). Two methods of alkali treatments, i.e., chemical (NaOH) and thermochemical (NaOH assisted with autoclaving) processes, were employed for the deconstruction of PPW. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to study the effects of alkali concentration (0.6\u20131.0 w/v), substrate concentration (5\u201315 g) and time (4\u20138 h) on the extraction of RS, TS and TP from PPW. The application of alkali plus steam treatment in Box-Behnken design (BBD) with three levels yielded the optimum releases of RS, TS and TP as 7.163, 28.971 and 4.064 mg/mL, respectively, corresponding to 10% substrate loading, in 0.6% NaOH for 8 h. However, the alkali treatment reported optimum extractions of RS, TS and TP as 4.061, 17.432 and 2.993 mg/mL, respectively. The thermochemical pretreatment was proven a beneficial process as it led to higher productions of TP. FTIR and SEM were used to analyze the deterioration levels of the substrate. The present work was used to explore the sustainable management of PPW, which is a highly neglected substrate bioresource but is excessively dumped in open environment, raising environmental concerns. The cost-effective methods for the breakdown of PPW starch into fermentable sugars might be utilized to extract valuable compounds.",

            "text": "Due to severe environmental concerns related to the dumping of food wastes, such as microbial spoilage and the emission of harmful gases, such practices are being strongly discouraged. The exploitation of food wastes for alternative and sustainable applications are being investigated. PPW can be transformed into various valuable products such as biofuel, biogas, bio-fertilizers, bio-absorbents, reducing sugar, enzymes and antioxidants [1\u20133]. About one-third of the total food produced for human consumption is estimated to be wasted [4], and these losses were estimated to cost 1 trillion USD [5]. Potato (Solanum tuberosum) is a major vegetable crop with annual production of 370 million tons [6]. A major part of potato production is as a fresh product, whereas the remaining part is used to meet the demands of fast food consumption such as frozen fries, crisps, starch and dried potatoes. During potato processing, 15 to 40% of the initial weight is descaled and is termed as PPW [7,8]. PPW is the major neglected by-product in the potato-processing industry, whilst it represents a potential source of valuable compounds. Among them, polyphenols are\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7250. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28217250 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7250 2 of 19\nimportant precursors for natural antioxidants and offer tremendous application potential owing to their antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. Approximately 50% of these molecules are present in the peel and adjacent sections [9,10]. Synthetic antioxidants are extensively used in food and pharmaceutical applications and have been reported to induce various chronic diseases. Natural antioxidants are highly appealing to various industrial sectors and offer protective applications such as the prevention of oxidative damage and cardiovascular diseases [11]. PPW has an important nutritious profile, containing starch, dietary fibre and protein. The most abundant nutrients in PPW are carbohydrates, accounting for up to 88 g/100 g dry weight. The amount of starch accounts for up to 52% of total carbohydrate content. PPW also has a considerable amount of dietary fibre, which can regulate intestinal health by lowering the cholesterol effect [8,12\u201315]. V\u00e1zquez et al. [16] have recently documented the promising potential of utilizing waste materials, specifically Garnacha Tintorera bagasse and potato residues, as sustainable substrates for the co-production of valuable bioproducts, such as bacterial cellulose and gluconic acid. Unprecedented rapid urbanization and continuously increasing standards of living in modern society lead to the production of huge quantities of solid food wastes. Consequently, additional management practices for the management of this waste exerts strong pressure on the economy and society [17,18]. There are different waste management practices for the disposal of food waste, but they have many problems such as the production of toxic compounds, high costs and environmental pollution [19]. The familiar waste disposal methods are landfills, incineration, composting and thermochemical processes [19,20]. The most common method of waste disposal is landfill, which produces greenhouse gases and toxic heavy metal compounds that contaminate land and ground water. This approach also requires large land area and a long time for disposal [21\u201324]. Incineration is a relatively rapid method for waste management and requires small land area but leads to the production of combustion residuals including bottom and fly ash. The elements contained in ash cannot be degraded and are eventually enriched in living organisms [25,26]. Composting is an effective method of degrading wastes into products that can be used safely as biofertilizers and soil improvements [27\u201329]. However, various challenges are also associated with this practice, including the release of CO2, the depletion of O2, climate change and offensive smells [30]. Biotechnological upgradation appears promising for the concomitant provision of low-cost substrates and safe solid food waste management. The application of PPW for microbial mediated saccharification and the provision of other useful products is representative of such efforts. Fermentable sugars can be obtained from PPW which can boost biofuel production. PPW is a rich source of primary metabolites, which principally include carbohydrates, which are prone to undergo fermentation to produce ethanol, lactic and acetic acid [31]. The breakdown of complex starch polymers into small monomeric sugars makes it more accessible to improve the production of biofuel. PPW conversion into biofuel and biogas offers excellent alternatives to fossil fuels. There are many previous research reports which have confirmed the conversion of PPW to biofuels [32\u201335]. A few new methods such as ultrasonic and microwave assisted extractions [36,37], pressurized liquid-based removal [38] and acidified solvents-based extraction [39] have been documented to isolate the valuable compounds from PPW. These are, however, highly complex and expensive methods; therefore, the need for simple, low cost and time saving methods cannot be over-emphasized. Alkali hydrolysis offers a number of advantages such as a simple pretreatment for substrate, easily available and cost-effective NaOH and low reaction temperature. Little information is available about the kinetics and efficiency of the alkali hydrolysis of PPW into sugars. In the present work, the efficacy of alkali and alkali-assisted autoclaving was clearly observed. Alkali and alkali-assisted steam treatment to extract useful compounds from different plant biowastes are methods of choice in select situations to obtain value added products [40\u201343]. The treated substrates are compared with their respective controls by SEM to assess the level of polymeric destruction [44\u201346].\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7250 3 of 19\nThe present study aimed to optimize the alkali treatment of PPW for yielding RS, TS and TPC using a Box\u2013Behnken design with three levels. The model developed in this study is cost-effective for the bioconversion of PPW into value added products such as fermentable sugars and phenolic compounds. As regards the optimum concentrations of fermentable sugars for bioethanol fermentation, they can easily be adjusted either by the evaporation of the treated fluid or by its dilution to correspond to the requirements of ethanologenic microbe(s). Evaporation is economically affordable in country such as Pakistan, where solar insolation is available throughout the year. However, other means to improve the saccharification efficiencies of the procedures reported here, such as varying steam pressures, might be employed to increase the yields. Soni et al. [47] have explored various conditions by using different alkali and acid concentrations to treat PPW and assessing their potential to produce bioethanol. They reported 368.53 mg/g of RS after 72 h using alkali-treated PPW, and after enzymatic hydrolysis ethanol concentration was recorded as 19.9g/L. Another research reported 88.2 g/L RS after enzymatic hydrolysis with 20% PPW. The maximum ethanol concentration of 23.3 g/L was produced under optimum conditions [48]. This effort is promising for the provision of cheaper substrates for various biotechnological processes such as the production of second-generation bioethanol. Accessory benefits include urban food waste management and the utilization of single-cell enriched fermentation residues as animal feed supplement."

            "text": "In this study RSM was used to optimize the pretreatment conditions using PPW as cheap biowaste. BBD was conducted using substrate concentration, NaOH concentration and time as independent variables. The alkali and alkali-plus-steam treatment of PPW was carried out with three variable factors as presented in Table 1. The experimental runs were performed according to the BBD, and all experiments were run in triplicates. The observed and predicted values of RS, TS and TP after alkali and alkali-assisted autoclave treatment are shown in Tables 2 and 3. Multiple regression analysis was applied, and second-order polynomial regression equations (Equations (1)\u2013(6) revealed the influence of three variable factors (X1, X2 and X3) on the extraction yield of useful compounds from PPW.\nIn the case of alkali hydrolysis, the maximum extraction of RS, TS and TP was measured as 4.061, 17.432 and 2.993 mg/mL, respectively, corresponding to 10 g of PPW, 0.8% of alkali concentration and 8 h (Table 2). In the case of alkali-plus-steam hydrolysis, maximum extraction of RS, TS and TPs was measured as 7.163, 28.971 and 4.064 mg/mL, respectively. The experimental conditions for optimum yield were observed at run No. 9, 7 and 14 (Table 3). The thermochemical treatment proved more effective in the monomerization of polymeric sugars of PPW. Several studies have indicated higher yields of useful compounds from the alkali and alkali-plus-steam treatment of PPW [47,49\u201352].\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7250 4 of 19\n2.1.1. Significance by ANOVA\nThe linear and the quadratic effects of the variables studied and their interaction on the response yield was observed using analyses of variance (ANOVA). The significance was revealed by Fisher\u2019s F-test and the probability value. In the case of alkali hydrolysis, F-test values of 31.64, 16.33 and 10.79 and p-values of 0.002, 0.010 and 0.022 were observed for RS, TS and TP, respectively. The results revealed that the concentration of the substrate and time were the most significant parameters during the pretreatment process. For RS production, X1, X3, X12 and X32 were found to be significant as their p-values were calculated as 0.006, 0.014,0.013 and 0.002, respectively, while for TS production, X12 and X32 were significant as their p-values were calculated as 0.056 and 0.010, respectively. In the case of TPC, the\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7250 5 of 19\nfactors X2, X32 and X1 \u00d7 X3 were found to be the most significant variables as their p-values were noted as 0.032, 0.031 and 0.022, respectively (Table 4).\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7250 6 of 19\nIn the case of alkali-plus-steam hydrolysis, F-test values of 17.99, 42.1461 and 24.08 and probability values of 0.008, 0.030 and 0.004 were observed for RS, TS and TP, respectively. The interactive effect of X2 \u00d7 X3 and X1 \u00d7 X3 on the response yield was found to be very significant. The results revealed that the concentration of PPW and time (h) were the most significant parameters during the pretreatment process. For RS yield, X2 and X2 \u00d7 X3 were found to be significant factors as their p-values were recorded as 0.034 and 0.008, respectively, while X1 \u00d7 X3 (0.030) was significant for the production of TS. In the case of TPC, the factors X32 and X2 \u00d7 X3 were found to be the most significant variables as their p-values were measured as 0.010 and 0.004, respectively (Table 5).\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7250 7 of 19\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7250 8 of 19\nY (TS mg/mL) = 13.540 + 0.1115X1 \u2212 44.222X2 + 7.4944X3 + 0.0598X12+ 26.4677X22 \u2212 0.0299X32 + 0.3935X1X2\u2212 0.3246X1X3 \u2212 2.8856X2X3 (5)\nY (TP mg/mL) = 0.8233 + 0.0777X1 \u2212 1.3983X2 + 0.6086X3 \u2212 0.00384X12 \u2212 07.3541X22 \u2212 0.1671X32 + 0.1747X1X2 \u2212 0.00150X1X3 + 1.9293X2X3\n(6)\nThe model\u2019s goodness of fit was determined by the coefficient of determination (R2\nvalue).The R2 values in the case of alkali hydrolysis were measured as 97.52%, 90.76% and 93.61% for RS, TS and TP, respectively, while in the case of alkali-assisted autoclave treatment these values were measured as 87.14%, 93.25% and 94.45% for RS, TS and TP, respectively. The adjusted R2 values were measured as 74.12%, 93.05% and 82.11% for chemical treatment, while for thermochemical treatment the same values were measured as 64.00%, 81.11% and 84.46% for RS, TS and TPC, respectively, explaining the credibility of the model. Furthermore, the predicted R2 values were measured as 0.71, 0.79 and 0.80 for chemical treatment, while for thermochemical treatment same values were measured as 0.68, 0.76 and 0.75 for RS, TS and TPC, respectively, explaining the credibility of the model.\n2.1.2. Contour Plots\nThe effect of the interaction of different factors on the extraction of RS, TS and TPC after alkali and alkali-assisted autoclave treatment was illustrated by 2D contour plots, as shown in Figures 1 and 2. In these plots three main colours are shown: light green and blue represent the lowest yield, while dark green represents the highest yield. From the alkalitreated contour plots it can be observed that substrate and alkali concentration had a direct relation to the production of RS, whereas time had an inverse relation to the production of RS. For TS production, optimum values were observed at high values of substrate and alkali concentration and time. High concentrations of substrate and alkali were favourable for the production of phenolic compounds, whereas time did not significantly affect the yield of phenolic compounds. From the alkali-plus-steam-treated contour plots it is evident that high RS production occurred at lower values of three parameters. For TS and TP production none of the three parameters was found significant, but increased production was observed with high values of substrate and alkali concentration."

The frozen sample was taken out, thawed and sonicated. A drop of the sample was then placed on a heated slide, which was then dried in an oven overnight. Following this, the sample was sputter-coated with carbon using a sputter coater model (Jeol JFC-1500, Tokyo, Japan). The coated sample slide was affixed to conductive tape stubs and subjected to SEM analysis. SEM images of the potato peel samples were acquired and analyzed at various magnifications, resolutions and angles."

            "text": "In this work, alkali and alkali-plus-steam treatments were used to extract bioactive compounds from PPW. The alkali-assisted steam treatment was found to be very effective and yielded 4.064 mg/mL of phenolic compounds from PPW. Optimum extractions of RS and TS were measured as 7.163 and 28.971 mg/mL, respectively. The maximum yield of phenolic compounds revealed that the lignin part was degraded. Lignin degradation makes the treated substrate more accessible for enzymatic hydrolysis, which subsequently boosts the saccharification process. The simple and cost-effective strategy of the deconstruction of PPW into valuable products is promising for the provision of various feedstocks to biotechnological processes with the sustainable management of food wastes. The alkaline treatments may render the PPW a cost-effective substrate for various biotechnological processes, whilst the waste microbial content will also be reduced for a better urban environment.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, Q.M.; Methodology, Q.M.; Software, Q.M.; Validation, Q.M.; Formal analysis, Q.M.; Investigation, Q.M.; Resources, Q.M.; Data curation, Q.M.; Writing\u2014 original draft, Q.M.; Writing\u2014review & editing, Q.M. and P.M.; Supervision, J.I.Q.; Project administration, N.J.
