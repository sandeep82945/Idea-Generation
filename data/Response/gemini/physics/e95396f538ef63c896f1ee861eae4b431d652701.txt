1. **Investigate the impact of different oxidant precursors on the degradation of a wider range of micropollutants.** The current study focused on three specific micropollutants (ibuprofen, naproxen, and diclofenac), but it would be valuable to examine how different oxidant precursors affect the degradation of a more diverse group of compounds. This would help to identify the most effective oxidant precursor for a given set of target pollutants.


2. **Evaluate the performance of UVC/H2O2 and UVC/S2O8 processes under different environmental conditions.** The current study was conducted under controlled laboratory conditions, but it is important to assess the performance of these processes under real-world conditions. This could involve field studies at wastewater treatment plants or pilot-scale studies in different geographic locations.


3. **Investigate the potential for combining UVC/H2O2 and UVC/S2O8 processes with other treatment technologies.** UVC/H2O2 and UVC/S2O8 processes could potentially be combined with other treatment technologies, such as biological treatment or membrane filtration, to improve the overall removal of micropollutants from wastewater. Future research could explore the potential benefits of such combinations.


4. **Develop models to predict the degradation of micropollutants by UVC/H2O2 and UVC/S2O8 processes.** Mathematical models could be developed to predict the degradation of micropollutants by UVC/H2O2 and UVC/S2O8 processes. These models could be used to optimize the design and operation of these processes and to assess their performance under different conditions.


5. **Conduct life cycle assessment and techno-economic analysis of UVC/H2O2 and UVC/S2O8 processes.** Life cycle assessment and techno-economic analysis could be conducted to evaluate the environmental and economic impacts of UVC/H2O2 and UVC/S2O8 processes. This information could be used to compare these processes with other treatment technologies and to inform decision-making about the implementation of these processes at wastewater treatment plants.
