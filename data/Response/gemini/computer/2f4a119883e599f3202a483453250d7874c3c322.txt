1. **Developing automated tools to measure and report the DL-specific attributes of PTMs.** This would help PTM reusers to make more informed decisions about which models to use.
2. **Investigating the impact of PTM reuse on the security and robustness of downstream applications.** This would help to identify potential risks associated with PTM reuse and develop mitigation strategies.
3. **Exploring the use of PTM recommendation systems to help engineers find the most suitable PTMs for their needs.** This would save engineers time and effort, and could also help to promote the use of high-quality PTMs.
4. **Developing new methods for detecting adversarial attacks on PTMs.** This would help to protect PTM reusers from malicious attacks and ensure the integrity of downstream applications.
5. **Studying the evolution of PTM reuse practices over time.** This would help to identify trends and patterns in PTM reuse, and could inform the development of new tools and techniques to support PTM reuse.
