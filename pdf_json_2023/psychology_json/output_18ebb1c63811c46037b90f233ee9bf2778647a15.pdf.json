This paves the way for ab initio calculations of real metals with chemical accuracy.\nIntroduction. \u2013 Ab initio methods that achieve systematically improvable accuracy for metallic systems are urgently needed to understand chemical reactions on metal surfaces or to compute the thermodynamic stability of materials. Currently available exchange and correlation energy density functionals often fail to achieve the desired level of accuracy compared to experiment. A prominent failure includes the incorrect prediction of molecular adsorption sites on metal surfaces [1]. As an alternative, more accurate Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations can be applied to metals [2, 3]. However, even diffusion QMC calculations exhibit a strong dependence on the fixed node approximation [4]. Compared to QMC and density functional theory, many-electron perturbation theories offer a conceptually different approach to solve the many-electron problem with high accuracy. In particular, coupled-cluster (CC) theory offers a systematically improvable ansatz for the many-electron wave function employing a series of higher order particle-hole excitation operators. While systems exhibiting strong correlation, e.g. stretched covalent bonds, require highorder excitation operators or multi reference approaches, single reference systems are already described accurately using low orders [5]. In particular, at the truncation level of single, double and perturbative triple particle\u2013hole excitation operators, CCSD(T) theory predicts atomization and reaction energies for a wide class of single reference molecules with an accuracy of approximately 1 kcal/mol [5]. As such, CCSD(T) is often referred to as the \u2018gold standard\u2019 of molecular quantum chemistry. This also motivated recent applications of coupled-cluster theory to study solids [6\u201311], where highly accurate predictions of, for example, pressure-temperature phase diagrams [12] could be achieved. However, it should be noted that such calculations require a careful convergence with respect to the employed basis sets and system size, which is much more complicated than for lower levels of theory [7, 10, 13].\nMoreover, metallic systems still constitute a major challenge for currently available CC theories. Although CCSD can be applied to metals, recently obtained results for a number of metallic systems indicate that CCSD falls short of achieving chemical accuracy in metals, which is expected and agrees with findings for molecules and insulating solids [14, 15]. The inclusion of the perturbative triples correction (T) though, is not possible due to the infrared catastrophe caused by the truncation of the many-electron perturbation expansion [16]. The infrared catastrophe leads to a divergence of the CCSD(T) correlation energy per electron for metals for increasing simulation cell sizes also referred to as the thermodynamic limit (TDL). A full non-perturbative inclusion of the triple excitation operator in the CC method is convergent but computationally too expensive and can only be applied to few relatively small systems [17]. Here, we present a modification to the perturbative triples theory that is applicable to metals and retains all desirable properties including its accuracy for insulating systems and low computational cost compared to a full inclusion of the triples.\nTheory \u2013 To better understand the infrared catastrophe of perturbation theories denoted as (X), we make use of the following three quantities: the correlation energy E (X) c , the electronic transition structure factor S(X)(q) and the quantity T (X)i (q). The correlation energy is defined as\nE(X)c = \u2211\nq\n\u03c5(q) [ \u03b4\u03c5abij \u03b4\u03c5(q) ( 2tabij \u2212 tabji ) (X) ]\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 :=S(X)(q)\n. (1)\nThe indices i, j and a, b denote occupied and virtual spatial orbitals, respectively. Einstein summation convention applies to repeated indices throughout this work. We will firstly focus on second-order perturbation theory, direct ring CC doubles (rCCD) theory,\nar X\niv :2\n30 3.\n16 95\n7v 3\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .m\ntr l-\nsc i]\n1 3\nJu n\n20 23\n2 which is closely related to the random-phase approximation (RPA), and CC doubles theory (CCD). We note that, due to the symmetry of the uniform electron gas (UEG) Hamiltonian, single excitations are absent. Furthermore, in the UEG, the one-electron orbitals are plane waves with wave vectors ki, kj and ka, kb. This allows to write the two-electron repulsion integral as \u03c5abij = \u03c5(q)\u03b4ki\u2212ka,kb\u2212kj , with the momentum transfer vector q = ki \u2212 ka, \u03c5(q) = 4\u03c0\u2126|q|2 and \u2126 being the volume of the simulation cell. The functional derivative \u03b4\u03c5abij \u03b4\u03c5(q) = \u03b4q,kb\u2212kj\u03b4q,ki\u2212ka enables a concise notation. The amplitudes tabij are obtained by solving the amplitude equations of the employed many-electron perturbation theory.\nEq. (1) introduces the electronic transition structure factor S(q), which gives access to the dependence of the correlation energy on the interelectronic interaction distance. An additional quantity of significance for the present work is given by\nT (X) i (q) = [ \u03b4\u03c5abij \u03b4\u03c5(q) tabij (X) ] . (2)\nSimilar to the structure factor, T (X)i (q) depends on the momentum transfer vector q.\nThe infrared catastrophe \u2013 Having introduced the most important quantities needed for our analysis, we turn to the case of second-order perturbation theory, which is a textbook example for the infrared catastrophe. In particular, we focus on second-order M\u00f8ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2), which employs the Hartree\u2013 Fock (HF) Hamiltonian as the unperturbed reference system [18].\nThe MP2 correlation energy is given by Eq. (1) using tabij = \u03c5abij /\u2206 ij ab, where \u2206 ij ab = \u03b5i + \u03b5j \u2212 \u03b5a \u2212 \u03b5b. The correlation energy for the UEG diverges due to the summation over elements in the amplitudes with both the occupied orbital i and the virtual orbital a close to the Fermi surface. The rate of divergence is log(q) [19] and log(log(q)) [20] for Hartree or HF orbital energies, respectively. q refers to the lower spherical cutoff radius in the analytical integration over q. Here, we employ HF orbital energies only. The comparison between analytic and numerical results is slightly complicated by the fact that \u2206ijab approaches the analytic behaviour of limq\u21920 \u2206 ij ab \u221d |q| ln(|q|) only slowly with respect to the studied system size. However, our numerical findings for tabij shown in Fig. 1(c) agree reasonably well with the analytic result of \u221d |q|\u22123/ log(|q|). The infrared catastrophe due to the singularity of S(q) at |q| = 0 can be inferred from the plot for MP2 theory shown in Fig. 1(a).\nThe numerical procedure follows the description in Ref. [21]. We use twist-averaging which helps to reduce the fluctuations due to discretization errors of the finite simulation cell [10, 22, 23].\nThe ring summation \u2013 As already demonstrated by Macke in 1950 [24], the divergence in second-order perturbation theory can be averted by including carefully selected higher-order contributions of the many-electron perturbation expansion, corresponding to ring diagrams. Algebraically, this can be implemented by solving the ring-coupled-cluster amplitude equation given by\ntabij = ( \u03c5abij + 2\u03c5 ak ic t cb kj + 2t ac ik\u03c5 kb cj + 4t ad il \u03c5 lk dct cb kj ) /\u2206ijab, (3)\nwhich is formally equivalent to solving the Casida equations [25]. For the ring-coupled-cluster correlation energy to converge in the long wavelength limit, the first term on the right-hand side of Eq.(3), which is equivalent to MP2 theory, needs to be partially cancelled by the additional linear ring (lr) and quadratic ring (qr) terms in the amplitudes.\nWe now address the question: How do the terms on the right-hand-side in Eq. (3) cancel each other in the limit |q| \u2192 0? To this end, we re-write Eq. (3) in the following way\ntrCCDij (q) = \u03c5(q)\n( 1 + 2 \u2211\nk\ntrCCDkj (q) + 2 \u2211\nk\ntrCCDik (q)\n+ 4 \u2211\nkl\ntrCCDil (q)t rCCD kj (q) ) /\u2206ijab,\n(4)\nwhich is possible because of momentum conservation and the fact that ring diagrams do not couple different q. As was shown by Freeman in Ref. [26], the solution of the above equation in the long wave limit leads to limq\u21920 T rCCDi (q) = \u22121/2. Consequently, the terms in the parenthesis in Eq.(4) vanish such that limq\u21920 trCCDij (q) \u221d |q|\u22121 [26]. We note that amplitudes diverging as |q|\u22121 yield convergent correlation energies and vanishing S(q)\u2019s for small |q|. Furthermore we stress that the above findings are identical for Hartree and Hartree\u2013Fock orbital energies. Fig. 1(c) depicts our numerical results for trCCDij (q), which diverges with the analytically known behaviour of |q|\u22121 in the long wavelength limit. The Supplemental Material (SM) contains numerical results confirming that limq\u21920 T rCCDi (q) = \u22121/2.\nWe complement the above discussion by numerically studying the rCCD transition structure factor and its individual diagrammatic contributions [27] given by\nSrCCD(q) = SMP2(q) + Slr(q) + Sqr(q). (5)\nThe calculated contributions to S(q) are depicted in Fig. 1(a). Although the individual contributions diverge, the total rCCD transition structure factor converges towards zero in the limit of q \u2192 0 (see Fig. 1(a)). We arrive at the first important insight of this work. The singularity at |q| = 0 in SMP2(q) is cancelled by one half of the linear ring terms, whereas the singularity of the quadratic\n3 FIG. 1: (a)&(b) UEG transition structure factor contributions at different levels of theory for 246 electrons with 2178 spatial orbitals and rs = 20 a.u.

We also stress that the leading-order behaviour of SrCCD(q) in the limit |q| \u2192 0 is SrCCD(q) \u221d |q|. This was shown by Bishop and L\u00fchrmann [28] (see Ref. [29] for a detailed discussion). For simulation cells with finite electron numbers this leads to a finite size error scaling of N\u22122/3, where N is the number of electrons. In passing, we note that insulating systems have a different leading order behaviour around q \u2192 0 given by SrCCD(q) \u221d |q|2, implying a finite size error scaling of N\u22121 [30, 31].\nThe coupled-cluster doubles method \u2013 Having established a framework to understand and analyse the divergence and convergence of correlation energies in MP2 and rCCD, we now turn to CCD theory. In addition to ring diagrams, CCD theory includes further terms, linear and quadratic in tCCDij (q) (the full set of CCD equations can be found in the SM). This makes an analytic solution impossible even for the simple UEG model. Note that the contributions of the linear terms are even identical to those from third-order perturbation theory, if tCCDij (q) is replaced by \u03c5abij /\u2206 ij ab. As discussed by Mattuk [19] for any finite-order perturbation theory, ring terms yield the most divergent contributions at small |q|. We stress that the dominance of the ring terms originates from the \u201cpiling-up of factors 1/q2\u201d, as the greatest piling-up occurs for the ring terms when only a single momentum transfer is involved [32]. Therefore, this dominance prevails irrespectively of the usage of tCCDij (q) instead of \u03c5abij /\u2206 ij ab at small |q|. Consequently, it follows, in agreement with the work of Emrich and Zabolitzky [33], that for the long wavelength limit: (i) in the CCD amplitude equations the most divergent contributions are the ones given in Eq.(4), and (ii) these ring contributions to the CCD amplitudes must therefore cancel each other\nprecisely as for the rCCD amplitude equations. This leads us to one pivotal conclusion of the present work: lim|q|\u21920 TCCDi (q) = lim|q|\u21920 T rCCD i (q) = \u22121/2.\nWe corroborate the above paragraph with numerical results for the individual contributions to tCCDij (q). Fig. 1(c) depicts that the lr and qr contributions diverge as \u221d |q|\u22123/ log(q). Note that these lr and qr contributions are evaluated using CCD amplitudes. Moreover, it is shown that the remaining linear and quadratic contributions to the CCD amplitudes denoted as rest-linear and rest-quadr, respectively, diverge with a weaker power for q \u2192 0. This underpins the conclusions drawn above that in the long wavelength limit: (i) the ring contributions to CCD amplitudes dominate, and (ii) the ring terms cancel each other precisely as in rCCD. Furthermore, we find that tCCDij (q) \u221d |q|\u22121, which leads to a transition structure factor SCCD(q) depicted in Fig. 1(a) that approaches zero in the limit of q \u2192 0.\nTriple particle-hole excitation operators \u2013 We now turn to CC theories that approximate the triple particle-hole excitation operator in a perturbative manner. In these cases the post-CCSD correlation energy and transition structure factor contributions are given by\nE(J)c = \u2211\nq\n\u03c5(q) [ \u03b4W abcijk \u03b4\u03c5(q) ( Aijkabc ) (J) ]\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 :=S(J)(q)\n. (6)\nHere, (J) refers to the employed approximation. In the case of (T), Aijkabc = W\u0304 ijk abc/\u2206 ijk abc with X\u0304 ijk abc = 4 3X ijk abc \u2212 2Xijkacb+ 2 3X ijk bca. \u2206 ijk abc refers to the difference in HF orbital energies for the occupied and unoccupied states labelled by the respective indices. W abcijk is defined as\nW abcijk = P abc ijk ( taeij \u03c5 bc ek \u2212 tabim\u03c5mcjk ) . (7)\n4 The permutation operator P abcijk is defined as P abc ijk X abc ijk = Xabcijk + X acb ikj + X cab kij + X cba kji + X bca jki + X bac jik . We employ the following functional derivative for a concise notation used to define the structure factor: \u03b4Wabcijk \u03b4\u03c5(q) = P abc ijk ( taeij \u03b4q,kk\u2212kc \u2212 tabim\u03b4q,kk\u2212kc ) . Fig. 1(b) depicts S(T)(q), which shares many similarities with SMP2(q). Both S(q)\u2019s exhibit a singularity for |q| \u2192 0 and yield correlation energies per electron that diverge as the system size increases. The infrared catastrophe of (T) is caused by the unscreened Coulomb interactions included in the approximation to Aijkabc [16].\nHere, we introduce a novel correlation energy expression that yields convergent energies for the UEG at the level of triple particle-hole excitation operators without depending on any ad-hoc parameters. We refer to the method as (cT) because it includes the complete set of terms present in the triples amplitude equations in a noniterative manner. Naturally, the coupling of triples amplitudes with each other is disregarded. Thus, in (cT) we use the following approximation to Aijkabc = M\u0304 ijk abc/\u2206 ijk abc, where\nM ijkabc = P abc ijk ( taeij \u03c5 bc ek + 2t ae ij \u03c5 bm ef t fc mk + . . . ) . (8)\nFor brevity we show only a selection of terms that exhibit a divergent behaviour for q \u2192 0. Note that the (T) and (cT) approximation to Aijkabc agrees for all terms linear in tabij . To cancel the divergence in (T), (cT) includes additional ring terms such as the second term in the above equation. We show the diagrams corresponding to both terms from Eq. (8) in Fig. 1(b). For these terms, it follows that \u03c5bcek +2\u03c5 bm ef t fc mk = \u03c5 bc ek(1+2Tm(q\n\u2032)), with q\u2032 = kk \u2212 kc. Note that q\u2032 \u2192 0 : 1 + 2Tm(q\u2032) = 0, which is formally identical to our results for the cancellation of the divergence between the linear ring and the MP2 terms in the long wavelength limit. We stress that (cT) also includes additional rest terms that are not related to the divergence of (T). The complete expression of M ijkabc including all contributions can be found in the SM and Ref. [34].\nFig. 1(b) confirms that S(cT)(q) converges in the long wavelength limit. Furthermore, S(cT)-ring(q) is shown to cancel the divergence of S(T)(q). For completeness, Fig. 1(b) also depicts S(cT)-rest(q), which includes all contributions to Eq. (8) that are not included in (T) or (cT)-ring, e.g. exchange-like terms. Our findings show that S(cT)-rest(q) converges to zero as q \u2192 0. This shows that the (cT) correlation energy expression averts the infrared catastrophe of the (T) approximation for the UEG without requiring an iterative solution of the triple amplitudes as recently proposed in Ref. [35].\nResults. \u2013 We now turn to the discussion of numerical results for correlation energies obtained for electron gas simulation cells with various electron numbers at different levels of theory. Fig. 1(d-e) displays the behavior\nof the correlation energy per electron as a function of N\u22122/3 for MP2, rCCD, CCD, (T) and (cT). The employed system sizes vary from N = 38 electrons to 342 electrons. All presented correlation energies have been extrapolated to the complete basis set (CBS) limit. The infrared catastrophe in MP2 theory becomes visible on approach to the TDL (N \u2192 \u221e) for Fig. 1(d). In contrast, rCCD and CCD correlation energies deviate considerably from the MP2 counterpart, converging as N\u22122/3 to the TDL. In an analogous way, Fig. 1(e) verifies that the (T) correlation energy contribution also diverges as we move to the TDL, while its counterpart, (cT), exhibits a behaviour that more closely resembles that of rCCD and CCD theories.\nTable I summarizes correlation energies obtained from CCD, CCD(T) and CCD(cT) methods compared to iFCIQMC, DMC and CCDT (CCD with full triple excitations) results. The energies were extrapolated to the CBS limit, and the systems were parametrized by a range of Wigner-Seitz radii (rs = 1, 2, 3, 5, 10 a.u.) and N = 14, 54 electrons. We first discuss the results obtained for the 14 electron system. In this case i-FCIQMC can be viewed as an exact reference, whereas CCDT serves as reference for any approximate triples theory. CCDT results from Ref. [17] are in good agreement with i-FCIQMC in the high density limit and differ at low densities. Higher levels of CC theory are needed to capture all important correlation effects for increasing rs [17]. CCD(T) and CCD(cT) correlation estimates are in good agreement with CCDT. We note that the agreement between CCD(T) and CCDT is fortuitous and only valid for small N , as can be seen from the divergence of CCD(T) as a function of N in Fig. 1(e).\nWe now discuss the results obtained for the 54 electron system summarized in Table I. Here, we compare to DMC reference results. In this case CCD(T) is fortuitously close to DMC even at relatively low densities corresponding to rs = 10 a.u. As can be seen from Fig. 1(b) and Fig. 1(e), this agreement is due to error cancellation between two effects. On the one hand, (T) overestimates long range correlation effects. On the other hand, higher-order cluster operators are missing in CCD(T), which underestimates correlation effects at lower densities. This error cancellation fails for larger electron numbers. CCD(cT) averts the infrared catastrophe and obtains accurate correlation energy results compared to DMC for all densities up to rs = 5 a.u. Only at lower densities CCD(cT) starts to deviate significantly from DMC due to the neglect of higher-order cluster operators.\nAs an important test, we apply CCSD(cT) theory to a set of molecules. In our benchmark we use a set of 26 different molecules that give access to 23 different closedshell reaction energies. This selection of molecules was already used in a previous work [13]. As reference we use energies from a converged CCSDT calculation. The standard deviation of the reaction energy for the 23 re-\n5 TABLE I: CBS limit correlation energies per electron of the UEG in mHa. rs is given in atomic units.\n14 electrons 54 electrons Method rs = 1 rs = 2 rs = 3 rs = 5 rs = 1 rs = 2 rs = 5 rs = 10 CCD -36.7 -29.2 -24.2 -18.1 -38.4 -30.2 -18.5 -11.3\nCCD(T) -37.9 -31.5 -27.1 -21.4 -39.9 -33.1 -22.6 -15.0 CCD(cT) -37.8 -31.3 -26.9 -21.1 -39.8 -32.8 -22.1 -14.5 CCDTa -37.9 -31.5 -27.0 -21.2 i-FCIQMCb -38.0 -31.8 \u2014 -21.9 DMCc -39.0 -32.6 -22.8 -15.6\na CCDT data are from the work of Neufeld and Thom [17]. b i-FCIQMC data are from the work of Shepherd et al.

[37]\nactions is 0.9 kJ/mol for both CCSD(T) and CCSD(cT) (the maximum error is 2.1 kJ/mol and 3.3 kJ/mol for CCSD(T) and CCSD(cT), respectively). This illustrates that both, CCSD(T) and CCSD(cT), are very accurate approximations for the full CCSDT energy.\nFinally, we present results for the lithium bcc metal. We find that CCSD(cT) predicts a cohesive energy of 60.1mHa/atom, which is in excellent agreement with the experimental estimate corrected for zero-point vibrations of 60.9mHa/atom [38]. Our estimate includes a HF, CCSD, (cT) and core-valence MP2 contribution of 20.5, 30.4, 8 and 1.2mHa/atom, respectively. The convergence of the (cT) correlation energy is depicted in Fig. 1(e). Numerical details can be found in the SM.\nSummary and conclusions. \u2013 We have introduced the highly accurate and computationally efficient CCSD(cT) theory, which paves the way for achieving chemical accuracy in ab initio calculations of real metals. Although the presented approach was applied to paramagnetic systems only, it can also be generalized to ferromagnetic systems using an unrestricted formalism.\nSeveral far reaching conclusions must be drawn from the present work. The RPA in the electron gas is formally identical to CCSD in the long wavelength limit. This explains why the embedding of CCSD into the RPA yields rapidly convergent results [39, 40]. Furthermore, the contributions of single particle-hole excitation operators is not taken into account for the UEG, which could also play an important role in real ab initio systems [41].\nOur work also sheds new light on potential shortcomings of CCSD(T) theory. This could explain (part of) the discrepancies observed between DMC and CCSD(T) interaction energies of large molecules [42].\nAcknowledgements. \u2013The authors thankfully acknowledge support and funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (Grant Agreement No. 715594).

In Fig. 1 we show numerical results for the UEG obtained with rCCD and CCD. One can see that mininum value of Ti(q) converges slowly to the theoretical expected limit of -0.5. For rCCD results with larger electron numbers are presented below.\nFIG. 1. The minimum value for a given momentum transfer q is shown for the quantity Ti(q). Results are shown for rCCD and CCD. Both simulations employed 730 electrons and a density of rs = 20.\nSTRUCTURE FACTOR FOR DIFFERENT VALUES OF rs\nThe discussion in the main article was based on a structure factor obtained for a density of rs = 20. Fig. 2 shows structure factors for different values of rs. This illustrates that the discussed behaviour of the structure factor not only holds for rs = 20, but is also true for the important range of values between 1 and 5. However, for larger values of rs the minimum of the structure factor is already observable for smaller electron numbers. This was the reason for choosing a rather high value of rs in the main article. In both calculations, roughly 18 virtual spatial orbitals per occupied spatial orbital are used.\nFIG. 2. For two different number of electrons N , twist-averaged structure factors for rCCD are shown. (a) shows results for rs = 3, (b) shows results for rs = 20.\nar X\niv :2\n30 3.\n16 95\n7v 3\n[\nco\nnd\n-m\nat .m\ntr l-\nsc i]\n1 3\nJu n\n20 23\n2\nFIG. 3.

Similar to the numerical results in the main article, a Hartree\u2013Fock reference is used in this calculations. Fig. 3(a) shows a very slow convergence of mini [Ti(q)] \u2192 \u22120.5 for q \u2192 0, whereas (b) shows the structure factor for both electron numbers. Finally, Fig. 3(c) shows the largest t-amplitude element on an absolute scale for a given q-point. It can be seen that the theoretical expected 1/|q| divergence for small values of q sets in only for very large electron numbers. This is a consequence of the finite size error. In all calculations, roughly 18 virtual spatial orbitals per occupied spatial orbital are used.\n3\nTable I summarizes correlation energy contributions obtained using different triple particle-hole excitation approximations. The geometries can be found in the work of Knizia et al. [1]. For these calculations the Hartree\u2013Fock ground state was obtained with the NWChem package [2] and interfaced to cc4s [3] as described in Ref. [4]. The here employed testset was already used in a previous work [5]. This is where Hartree\u2013Fock and CCSD energies for the given molecules can be found.\n4 COUPLED CLUSTER DOUBLES (CCD) AMPLITUDE EQUATION\nHere we present the closed-shell coupled-cluster doubles amplitude equations, which can also be found elsewere[6].

(a) Thermodynamic limit convergence of the HF energy per atom. (b) Basis-set convergence of the CCSD correlation energy per atom using a simulation cell with 44 Li atoms. (c) Thermodynamic limit convergence of the CCSD correlation energy per atom.\nCOMPUTATIONAL DETAILS ON THE CALCULATIONS OF METALLIC LITHIUM\nMetallic body-centered cubic (BCC) lithium is considered. All calculations are performed using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) [7] for HF and MP2 energies, as well as cc4s code [3] for coupled cluster energies. VASP is based on periodic boundary conditions and makes use of the projector augmented-wave (PAW) formalism [8]. We consider one valence electron per Li atom, using the PAW POTCAR file labeled as Li GW and a plane-wave cutoff parameter of ENCUT = 141 eV.\nFor efficient coupled cluster calculations, a compression of the unoccupied HF manifold is achieved via approximate MP2 natural orbitals (NOs) [9], while a low-rank decomposition is employed to compress the Coulomb integrals as described in Ref. [10]. Both schemes introduce a controlable error which is kept well below 10\u22122 mHa for the low-rank decomposition of the Coulomb integrals. The basis-set error of the CCSD correlation contribution, as introduced by the restricted number of NOs, is converged to sub-mHa accuracy using a recently proposed focal-point correction scheme (here denoted as FPC) [5], as can be observed in Fig. 4(b). For the (cT) and (T) correlation contribution, a relatively small number of 5 NOs per occupied orbital is used and corrected by an 1/NNO extrapolation from 5 to 10 NOs using a simulation cell containing 26 Li atoms. This is sufficient, since the basis-set dependence of both (cT) and (T) is weak. The thermodynamic limit of bulk bcc lithium is reached with high precision, using the extrapolation law of (NkNatoms)\n\u22122/3, as depicted in Fig 4(a)+(c). Twist-averaging is used to reduce the fluctuations due to discretization errors of the finite simulation cells. The geometries and atomic structures of these cells are given below.\nFurthermore, the core-valence contribution to the correlation energy is estimated by an all-electron PAW POTCAR file labeled as Li AE GW. In this case three electrons per Li atom are considered as valence electrons. Since the 1s2 HF orbitals are located about \u221263 eV below the Fermi level, we consider the MP2 method as sufficient for this task. Here a plane-wave cutoff of ENCUT = 543 eV is used. The individual contributions to the atomization energy of bulk bcc lithium are reported in the main document.\nAtomic structures of the used bcc lithium supercells in units of A\u030angstrom.\n26
