This study aims to find out how hyperglycemia affect oxidative stress and then the expression and methylation of endothelin 1 (ET-1) gene in in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC).\nMethods: Cells were cultured in growth medium and exposed to low and high glucose concentrations to mimic normal and diabetic condition respectively. Computational analysis were performed using UCSC genome browser and eukaryotic promoter database (EPD). The expression of ET-1 gene was investigated by real time PCR. Cytotoxicity and oxidative stress were determined by MTT and DCFH-DA assays respectively. Promoter methylation was assessed by the bisulfite sequencing method.\nResults:DCFH-DA assay showed that hyperglycemia can significantly increase the regulation of reactive oxygen species synthesis. The relative expression of ET-1 gene was increased due to exposure to high glucose concentration. MTT assay revealed reduced viability of cells due to the glucose induced damage. Methylation analysis revealed hypomethylation of the promoter of ET-1 however the difference was not significant. Out of 175 CpGs at 25 CpG sites, only 36 CpGs were methylated (20.5% methylation) in cell treated with normal glucose. Upon exposure to high glucose only 30 CpGs were methylated in 175 CpGs at 25 CpG sites (17.1% methylation).\nDiscussion: Our study concludes a significantly high expression of ET-1 gene in response to high glucose exposure in HUVECs. It also reports that hyperglycemic condition leads to elevated oxidative stress. No significant change was found in methylation when cells were treated with high and low glucose concentrations.\nKEYWORDS\nET-1, gene expression, methylation, hyperglycemia, oxidative stress"

            "text": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a multifactorial disease in which body fails to release or respond to insulin. The increasing incidence of diabetes is a growing concern, causing a huge death toll and disability worldwide (Safi et al., 2014a; Barysheva, 2015; Shestakova and Maioriv, 2019; Darenskaya et al., 2021). In diabetes, chronic hyperglycemia consequently contributes to the progression of several other diabetic complications including endothelial dysfunction, insulin resistance, nephropathy and retinopathy (Safi et al., 2014b; Cho et al., 2018). Vascular endothelium performs a range of functions including maintenance of vascular homeostasis and regulation of adhesion molecules. The condition in which endothelium fails to maintain vascular homeostasis is known as endothelial dysfunction (Sena et al., 2013; Cai et al., 2021).\nUnder hyperglycemic conditions, the normal vascular physiology changes to endothelial dysfunction, which leads to dysfunctional cellular redox and increased generation of oxidative stress (Meza et al., 2019). Increased ROS generation leads to aberrant regulation of a range of genes including inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules. In response to hyperglycemic environment, several pro-inflammatory pathways also participate during the process of oxidation and antioxidation. Consequently, the imbalance of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant and ROS generation induce endothelial dysfunction by augmenting endothelium permeability, necrosis and apoptosis in endothelial cells (Batumalaie et al., 2013; SZ Safi et al., 2015; Safi et al., 2016; Escobar-Morreale et al., 2017; Luna and Est\u00e9vez, 2018; Safi et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022).\nEndothelin 1 (ET-1) gene is a very important vasoconstrictor gene which is primarily expressed in vascular endothelial cells. Due to its role as vasoconstrictor, this gene contributes to vascular remodeling in diabetes and other diabetic complications. ET-1 is reported to play a key role in endothelial dysfunction (du Plooy et al., 2017; Kruger et al., 2012; Akter et al., 2015). ET-1, TNF-\u03b1 and angiotensin II are some of the inducing factors of superoxide radical (O2\u2212) generation (M\u00fcnzel et al., 2010; Montezano and Touyz, 2012). In endothelial dysfunction, various studies have demonstrated the role of ET-1 gene in augmenting ROS and\nincreased production of O2- in human arteries and animal vessels (Elmarakby et al., 2005; Loomis et al., 2005; B\u00f6hm et al., 2007; Cerrato et al., 2012; S\u00e1nchez et al., 2014). Studies have also shown that blocking the ET receptor improves endothelial function in human coronary arteries (Verma et al., 2001; Romero et al., 2009).\nEpigenetics is an emerging field in which epigenetic modification can regulate genes without changing their sequences. These are heritable and stable modifications which alter the gene function without changing the DNA sequence (Pradhan et al., 2016; \u00c1lvarez-Nava and Lanes, 2018; Ling and R\u00f6nn, 2019). In diabetic complications, a number of studies have found alterations in DNA methylation which could change the gene expression profiles, and consequently the fate of the disease (Rakyan et al., 2011; Volkmar et al., 2012). One study reported hypomethylation in DNA from liver tissue (Williams et al., 2008). Another study on diabetic rat model found increased DNA methylation in pancreatic tissue. This study concluded that methylation and demethylation of DNA in diabetes may attribute to various factors the local conditions and type of tissue exposed to the disease (Williams and Schalinske, 2012).\nKeeping in view the above reports, and the role of epigenetics, the purpose of this study was to assess the level of methylation and its association with the expression of ET-1 gene. We also aimed to investigate the association of hyperglycemia and the level of reactive oxygen species in hyperglycemic human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). To this end, we exposed the cells to high and low glucose concentrations and evaluated the expression of ET-1 gene. We also studies the methylation level in ET-1 gene to establish its role in hyperglycemic condition and probe the possibility of any association between gene expression and methylation in cells with high oxidative stress."

The 2,032 bp transcript of ET-1 gene had a 636 bp coding region, in which 269 bp was 5\u2032UTR and 1,127 bp 3\u2032UTR. Relative to transcription start site (TSS), promoter sequences (from 180 downstream to \u22121000 upstream) were identified using Eukaryotic Promoter Database (EPD). Out of 1180 bp long promoter sequence (from 180 downstream to \u22121000 upstream) a 400 bp sequence, with appropriate number of CpGs was identified for primer designing. The 400 bp sequence contained a 180 pb downstream sequence, relative to TSS within the 5\u2032UTR. The remaining 220 bp sequence was from the upstream region (\u2212220) relative to TSS. Subsequently, primers were designed within the 400 bp sequence using MethPrimer tool, as shown in Figures 1, 2.\nPCR amplification and bisulfite conversion\nAfter quantification, a total of 500 ng of extracted DNA was bisulfite-converted using commercially available EZ DNA kit (Zymo United States).

We were interested to see this in human umbilical vein endothelial cells which were treated with high and low concentrations of glucose for different time periods (24 and 48 h). Our results demonstrated a significantly high oxidative stress in cells treated with high glucose as compared to those which were treated with normal glucose concentration. ROS levels were comparatively high in those cells which were exposed for 48 h (p-value 0.006) as compared to 24 h (p-value 0.014). This was consistent with the expression of ET-1 and cell viability in MTT assay (Figure 5).\nET- 1 gene methylation and associated factors\nAfter we detected a significantly high ET-1 expression in HUVECs, we presumed a hypomethylation in the promoter of\nFrontiers in Genetics frontiersin.org06\nET-1. To check our hypothesis we carried out promoter methylation analysis. We evaluated 25 CpGs in each sample, where we had 7 samples for each high glucose and low glucose treated cells. So we investigated a total of 175 CpGs in high glucose treated cells and 175 CpGs in low glucose treated cells (control). As shown in Figures 6A, B, we found 36 methylated CpGs out of 175 CpGs in HUVECs treated with normal glucose concentration. In high glucose treated cells, the number of methylated CpGs was 30 (Figures 6C, D). Contrary to our expectations, the hypomethylation in glucose treated cells was very trivial and insignificant (Figure 6E). This demonstrates that hyperglycemia and high oxidative stress may regulate the expression of ET-1 gene without involving methylation at its promoter sequence. Cells with low glucose concentrations exhibited high methylation at CpG positions 22, 251, 236 and 380. At positions 92, 155, 247, 295 and 314, no methylation was found. Cells treated with high glucose concentrations, showed high methylation at positions 22, 74 and 260. No methylation was detected at positions 34, 100, 251, 289 and 305."

            "text": "Hyperglycemia and reactive oxygen species are the hallmarks of diabetes and diabetic complications. In this study we demonstrate that a 24 and 48 h exposure of HUVECs to high glucose significantly alter the ET-1 gene expression. It also negatively affect the viability of cells with increased level of reactive oxygen species. Hyperglycemia caused a significant reduction in cell viability which suggested that glucose has created a pro-oxidative stress environment. In such diabetic and high oxidative stress conditions, studies have shown that pro-diabetic, pro inflammatory and pro-oxidative stress genes are highly expressed. Several studies have reported altered gene expressions in such conditions (Shaik et al., 2010; Safi et al., 2018; Bima et al., 2022a; Aziz et al., 2022; Bima et al., 2022b). In a recent study, Hall et al. reported a significant impact of high glucose exposure on global gene expression andDNAmethylation in human pancreatic islets (Hall et al., 2018). Several genes including VAC14, RASD1, SYT16, CHRNA5 and TMED3 showed altered gene expression in response to high glucose exposure. Another study reported distinct patterns of gene expressions in primary human skin cells treated with normal and high glucose concentrations (Zhang et al., 2021).\nA number of studies have reported altered methylation patterns in response to high glucose exposure. In 2020, Kandilya et al. reported varied levels of DNA methylation in human neural progenitor cells (Kandilya et al., 2020). Several other studies have also concluded that altered DNA methylation and other epigenetic mechanisms play an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetes and other diabetic complications (Ling et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2016; Ahmed et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2021). Similarly, elevated levels of both reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DNA methylation have been reported to be the characteristics of various diseases including cancer, diabetes, endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis (Wu et al., 2016). Several studies have reported a possible association of elevated oxidative stress and epigenetic modifications (Galligan et al., 2014; Wu and Ni, 2015; Khan et al., 2016; Kreuz and Fischle, 2016; Zhou et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2018).\nIn diabetic patients, high blood glucose and elevated oxidative stress contribute to affect the epigenetic landscape, thus leading to persistent upregulation/downregulation of genes controlling vascular homeostasis. A significant shift in gene expression profiles also point to an altered methylation in the promoter sequences of the respective genes. After confirming varied cell viability and significant changes in oxidative stress toward normal and high glucose exposure, followed by a significantly high expression of ET-1 gene in high glucose samples, we hypothesized reduced methylation in the promoter of ET-1 gene. To check our hypothesis we analyzed 175 CpGs at 25 CpG sites in HUVECS treated with normal and high glucose concentrations. Out of 75 CpGs, we found only 36 methylated CpGs in cell treated with normal glucose (20.5% methylation). To our understanding it was quite low methylation however we were expecting further reduction after cells being exposed to high glucose concentration. Surprisingly, the outcome was not as we expected. In cells treated with high glucose, showed almost similar number of methylated CpGs (30 methylated CpGs out of 175) which makes 17.1% methylation in comparison to 20.5% methylation in normal glucose treated HUVECs (Figure 6). Cells with low glucose concentrations exhibited high methylation at CpG positions 22, 251, 236 and 380. At positions 92, 155, 247, 295 and 314, no methylation was found. Cells treated with high glucose concentrations, showed high methylation at positions 22, 74 and 260. No methylation was detected at positions 34, 100, 251, 289 and 305.\n24 and 48 h exposure of cells to glucose demonstrated a time dependent effect on cell viability and oxidative stress. ET-1 gene expression was also affected in a time dependent manner. However we used only maximum (48 h) exposure for the methylation analysis, as it has shown the maximum effect on cell viability and reactive oxygen species.\nOur data conclude that cells treated with high and low glucose concentrations demonstrate no significant difference in the promoter methylation of ET-1 gene. In hyperglycemic conditions, the significant changes in the expression of ET-1 gene might be due to other factors. Oxidative stress and hyperglycemia may regulate the gene expression by recruiting other proteins."
