A statistically significant increase was noted for depressive and anxiety relapses (p=0.04; r=0.7). Fear of catching the virus while attending hospital facilities (17.6%), geographical isolation (17.6%), unavailability of treatment (17%) and poor insight (41.2%) were the primary causes of poor adherence.

Shilko\nLomonosov Moscow State University, Psychology, Moscow, Russian Federation *Corresponding author. doi: 10.1192/j.eurpsy.2022.1254\nIntroduction: Support from a different sources can have a critical impact on a person\u2019s mental health in a stressful situation. In situations of prolonged stress, it is necessary to identify the links between specific sources of support and mental health. Objectives: To identify the connections between different sources of social support and mental health indicators in different periods during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMethods: DASS ( Lovibond, Lovibond, 1995) and MSPSS (Zimet et al., 1988) were applied. The study involved 855 people aged from 18 to 60 years (M=32.9; SD=13.88). The study was conducted online in the spring of 2020 (N=426) and in the winter of 2021 (N=429). Results: Post Hoc Scheffe revealed that perceived peer support in spring 2020 was significantly lower than in winter 2021 (p<0.05). With Pearson correlation coefficient, we tested the connections between perceived social support from family, friends, and significant others and the level of depression, anxiety, and stress. In spring 2020, all mental health indicators were associated with the perceived social support from all three sources (friends, family, and significant others). In the winter of 2021, depression levels were still associated with the perceived social support from all three sources, while the levels of anxiety and stress were associated only with perceived family support. Conclusions: Thus, the study has revealed the dynamics in dependence ofmental health indicators on the perceived social support from various sources at different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic create an increased level of anxiety and attention to respiratory sensations, which becomes a favorable ground for the occurrence of dysfunctional breathing. Objectives: To examine the relationship of ideas about the pandemic with the occurrence of dysfunctional breathing in the Russian population during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The Naimigen Questionnaire (Van Dixhoorn, Duivenvoordent, 1985) and the author\u2019s socio-demographic questionnaire were used, which included questions about personal experience of the pandemic. The study was conducted online from April 27 to December 28, 2020. It was attended by 1,362 people from all regions of Russia, including 1,153 women and 209 men aged 15 to 88 years (38.3 11.4). Results: It was found that respondents who are more confident in the danger of coronavirus have more respiratory difficulties (N=517;NQ=19 10.6) compared to those who consider its danger exaggerated (N=454,NQ=15.9 9.2,p=0.000). Respondents who are completely convinced of the absence of a condemnation for COVID-19 disease have less pronounced dysfunctional breathing\nhttps://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2022.1255 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n(N=331,NQ=15.26 9.5), compared to those who sure about it (N=88,NQ=19.16 10.05, p=0.007). Respondents who have relatives ill COVID-19 (N=430) have a higher score on NQ (18.6 10.5), compared with those dont have (N=932, NQ=17.1 9.7, p =0.011). Conclusions: The dysfunctional breathing is associated with the respondents\u2019 beliefs about the danger of coronavirus and the expectation of stigmatization in COVID-19 disease, as well as with the experience of COVID-19 disease among relatives.\nDisclosure: Research is supported by the Russian Science Foundation, project No. 21-18-00624.

Dysfunctional breathing is experienced as a feeling of \u201cdifficulty in breathing\u201d, which in the conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic may be similar to the symptoms of coronavirus infection (Taverne et al., 2021). Objectives: To examine the role of socio-demographic predictors in the prevalence of dysfunctional breathing in the Russian population during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The author\u2019s socio-demographic questionnaire, the Naimigen Questionnaire (Van Dixhoorn, Duivenvoordent, 1985), the STAI (Spielberger et al., 1983) and the \u201cPerceived Stress Scale-10\u201d (Cohen,Kamarck,Mermelstein,1983) were used. The study was conducted online fromApril 27 toDecember 28, 2020. Itwas attended by 1,362 people from all regions of Russia (38.3 11.4 y.o.). Results: In men, the average values for NQ (11.19 7.74) are lower than among women (18.73 9.96, p=0.000). Persons with incomplete higher education have a higher score on NQ (N=103,NQ=20.44 11.8) than persons with higher education (N=1051,NQ= 17.40 9.63,p=0.048) and candidates/doctors of sciences (N=97,NQ= 15.34 11.20,p=0.005). There was also a connection between the severity of dysfunctional breathing and the level of income, which is associated with a negative correlation between income level and perception of stress (r=-0.215,p=0.000), state (r=-0.165,p=0.000) and trait anxiety (r=-0.127,p=0.000). Conclusions: The severity of dysfunctional breathing is associated with gender, income levels and education, what can be used to identify a group of people who are most susceptible to the occurrence of dysfunctional breathing during the pandemic COVID-19.

Panteleimon, 2nd Covid Clinic, Nikaia, Greece and 3General Hospital of Nikaia, Psychiatric, Nikaia, Greece *Corresponding author. doi: 10.1192/j.eurpsy.2022.1257\nIntroduction: All pandemic outbreaks because of their rapid spread and highmortality rate cause to everyone considerable stress and anxiety. Objectives: The aim of the present study is to investigate how news media exposure moderates the relationship between stress, anxiety, depression and self-efficacy, social support, knowledge of the coronavirus and coronavirus perception. Methods: 223 healthcare providers, men 46 (20.6%) and women 177 (79.4%), working in hospitals in Greece participated in the study. independent t-test, one-way ANOVAs, Pearson\u2019s correlation, multiple-linear regression and moderator\u2019s analysis were analyzed with SPSS23. Results: Organization support, friends support, covid-19 knowledge and covid-19 perception are most significant predictors to stress, F (4,218) = 11.47, p < .001 and Adjusted R2- .159. Friends support, covid-19 knowledge and self-efficacy, working with covid19 patients and gender are most significant predictors to anxiety, F (5,217) = 11.16, p < .001 Adjusted R2- .186. Friends support, covid-19 knowledge and self-efficacy and organization support are most significant predictors to depression, F (4,218) = 16.37, p < .001 Adjusted R2-squared: .217. News media exposure did moderate the predictive power of almost all predictors for stress, anxiety and depression, at p<.05. Conclusions: Therefore, the study verifies previous findings arguing that stress, anxiety and depression are strongly associated with numerous factors. These associations seem to be moderated by news media exposure. It is recommended to further explore the impact news media exposure has during crucial periods, such as covid-19 outbreak.\nDisclosure: No significant relationships.
