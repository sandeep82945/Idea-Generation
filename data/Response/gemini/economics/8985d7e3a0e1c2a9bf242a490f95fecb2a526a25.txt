1. **Investigate the relationship between optimality and stability under different notions of stability.** The paper defines two new notions of stability, stable-c and stable-cc, and shows that they are not compatible with IC and IR. It would be interesting to investigate the relationship between these notions of stability and optimality, and to see if there are any other notions of stability that are compatible with IC and IR.
2. **Design new mechanisms that satisfy optimality and stability under different notions of stability.** The paper presents a new mechanism, Connected Trading Cycles (CTC), that satisfies IC, IR, stable-cc, and optimal-c. It would be interesting to design new mechanisms that satisfy optimality and stability under different notions of stability, such as stable-c or other notions that may be developed in the future.
3. **Extend the results to other types of matching markets.** The paper focuses on one-sided matching markets with initial endowments. It would be interesting to extend the results to other types of matching markets, such as two-sided matching markets or matching markets with transferable utility.
4. **Investigate the impact of social networks on the efficiency of matching mechanisms.** The paper shows that the social network can have a significant impact on the efficiency of matching mechanisms. It would be interesting to investigate this impact in more detail, and to see how the social network can be used to design more efficient matching mechanisms.
5. **Develop new characterizations of incentive compatibility in the network setting.** The paper presents a new characterization of IC in the network setting, based on preference monotonicity and diffusion monotonicity. It would be interesting to develop new characterizations of IC in the network setting, and to see if there are any other properties that can be used to characterize IC.
