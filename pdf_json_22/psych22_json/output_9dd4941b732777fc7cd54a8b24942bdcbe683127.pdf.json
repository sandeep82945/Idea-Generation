    "abstractText": "Objective: This study aimed to generate updated normative data for commonly used tests in neuropsychological assessment applied to older monolingual Spanish-speaking adults: Verbal fluency tests, the Trail Making Test (TMT), and the Rey\u2013Osterrieth complex figure test (ROCF). Method: To obtain normative data, 382 cognitively healthy 60to 90-year-old Spanish monolingual participants from the Autonomous Community of Madrid (Spain) with 0\u201322 years education were assessed using an overlapping interval strategy that involved cell and midpoint techniques, and that assessed the influence of age, education, and sex. Results: Age and education were associated with the scores in the verbal fluency tests, TMT, and ROCF, whereas sex only significantly affected the TMT results. Age-adjusted scaled scores (SSA) based on percentile ranks were also converted into age\u2013education scaled scores (SSAE) using a linear regression model. In addition, tables with the relevant adjustments for sex are provided for TMT-A and TMT-B. Conclusions: Thus, this study provides updated, uniform normative data for widely used neuropsychological tests on older Spanish adults. The normative procedure followed helps to make consistent comparisons when using these neuropsychological tests, which will improve the interpretation of the data obtained when these tools are employed, reducing the risk of misdiagnosing cognitive impairment in older adults.",

Method: To obtain normative data, 382 cognitively healthy 60- to 90-year-old Spanish monolingual participants from the Autonomous Community of Madrid (Spain) with 0\u201322 years education were assessed using an overlapping interval strategy that involved cell and midpoint techniques, and that assessed the influence of age, education, and sex. Results: Age and education were associated with the scores in the verbal fluency tests, TMT, and ROCF, whereas sex only significantly affected the TMT results. Age-adjusted scaled scores (SSA) based on percentile ranks were also converted into age\u2013education scaled scores (SSAE) using a linear regression model. In addition, tables with the relevant adjustments for sex are provided for TMT-A and TMT-B. Conclusions: Thus, this study provides updated, uniform normative data for widely used neuropsychological tests on older Spanish adults. The normative procedure followed helps to make consistent comparisons when using these neuropsychological tests, which will improve the interpretation of the data obtained when these tools are employed, reducing the risk of misdiagnosing cognitive impairment in older adults.\nKeywords: Normative data; Verbal fluency tests; Trail Making test; Rey\u2013Osterrieth complex figure test; Executive function; Older adults"

            "text": "The global increase in life expectancy and the associated population aging is shifting demands on healthcare. As the population ages, the risk associated with the appearance of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia increases (Petersen, 2004). In order to diagnose MCI, as well as to track cognitive disease progression in patients, validated neuropsychological assessment tools are required (Ivnik, Malec, Smith, Tangalos, & Petersen, 1996). The verbal fluency tests (Lezak, Howieson, Bigler, & Tranel, 2012), the Trail Making Test (TMT-A and -B) (Reitan & Wolfson, 1993), and the Rey\u2013Osterrieth complex figure test (ROCF) (Osterrieth, 1944; Rey, 1941) are among the most widely used instruments in neuropsychological and clinical assessment. Besides, these tests have a high sensitivity and diagnostic capacity to detect MCI\nic.oup.com /acn/article/37/5/952/6492653 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 17 January 2024\nearly, as well as predictive value for the diagnosis of incipient dementia (Caffarra, Vezzadini, Dieci, Zonato, & Venneri, 2002; Clark et al., 2012; Garc\u00eda-Herranz, D\u00edaz-Mardomingo, Venero, & Peraita, 2019; Molinuevo et al., 2011).\nPhonemic and semantic fluency tests are tasks of linguistic production that allow not only lexical access and language abilities to be explored but also several components of executive processes like access to semantic memory and self-monitoring (Eastman et al., 2013; Pe\u00f1a-Casanova, 1991; Shao, Janse, Visser, & Meyer, 2014). The TMT allows processing speed, sustained attention, sequence alternation, and visual scanning to be assessed (Lezak et al., 2012; Reitan & Wolfson, 1993; S\u00e1nchez-Cubillo et al., 2009). Moreover, although the completion of both TMT-A and TMT-B is critically influenced by graphomotor speed and visual scanning (O\u2019Rourke et al., 2011; S\u00e1nchez-Cubillo et al., 2009), performance in TMT-B depends on several executive functions that include working memory, inhibition control, and set-switching abilities (Lezak et al., 2012; S\u00e1nchez-Cubillo et al., 2009). The ROCF (Osterrieth, 1944; Rey, 1941) is a test of visuospatial ability and incidental visual recall that also evaluates some components of executive functions, such as organization, planning ability, attentional capacity, and problem-solving strategies (Lezak et al., 2012; Meyers & Meyers, 1995; Mitrushina, Boone, Razani, & D\u2019Elia, 2005).\nExecutive functions are a set of cognitive processes that regulate and control end-directed behaviors, and they include a wide range of abilities, such as attentional capacity, planning, organization, cognitive flexibility, response selection, inhibition and interference control, and updating (Chan, Shum, Toulopoulou, & Chen, 2008; Diamond, 2013; Lezak et al., 2012; Reuter-Lorenz, Festini, & Jantz, 2016). Consequently, impaired executive functions can have a negative impact on activities of daily living and quality of life (Marshall et al., 2011).\nDuring normal aging, neurological changes in the frontal lobes occur early (McDaniel & Einstein, 2011), concomitant with a decline in executive functions (Bettcher et al., 2016; Yuan & Raz, 2014). At present, there is evidence that impaired executive functions may be an early predictor of progression from MCI to Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), particularly when paired with deficits in episodic memory (Albert et al., 2011; Aretouli, Tsilidis, & Brandt, 2013; Clark et al., 2012; Marshall et al., 2011; Mez et al., 2013). In addition, impaired executive functions can also occur in other neurodegenerative disorders including Huntington\u2019s disease (Lemiere, Decruyenaere, Evers-Kiebooms, Vandenbussche, & Dom, 2004), frontotemporal dementia (Ramanan et al., 2017), and dementia with Lewy bodies (Ferman et al., 2006).\nIn order to accurately identify age-related cognitive decline in executive functions as early as possible, it is critical to have updated normative data for the neuropsychological assessment tools used. In addition, these data must take into account the influence of sociodemographic variables like age, level of education, and sex (Acevedo et al., 2007; Rosselli & Ardila, 2003). The relevance of such sociodemographic factors when assessing performance in verbal fluency tests, and in the TMT and ROCF tests, has been recognized consistently (Benito-Cuadrado, Esteba-Castillo, B\u00f6hm, Cejudo-Bolivar, & Pe\u00f1a-Casanova, 2002; Caffarra et al., 2002; Cavaco et al., 2013a; Llin\u00e0s-Regl\u00e0 et al., 2017; Machulda et al., 2007; Pe\u00f1a-Casanova, Qui\u00f1ones-\u00dabeda, Gramunt-Fombuena, et al., 2009; Pe\u00f1a-Casanova, Qui\u00f1ones-\u00dabeda, Quintana-Aparicio, et al., 2009; Pe\u00f1a-Casanova, Gramunt-Fombuena, et al., 2009; Tombaugh, 2004; Tremblay et al., 2015; Tsatali et al., 2020).\nIn addition, monolingualism/bilingualism is an important factor to take into account in the elaboration of normative data for cognitive assessment tools, particularly when using verbal fluency tests. Cumulative evidence has indicated that monolingual individuals outperform bilingual subjects in verbal fluency tasks (Bialystok, Craik, & Luk, 2012; Mercier, Pivneva, & Titone, 2014), whereas bilingualism has been associated with subtle advantages in some nonverbal executive functions, although mixed findings have been reported and this issue has yet to be fully resolved (for a review see Grundy & Timmer, 2017 or Paap, Johnson, & Sawi, 2015).\nThe establishment of uniform normative data allows the performance of an individual to be compared with that of their reference group, based on age, sex, educational level, and the language of use (Harvey, 2012; Salthouse, 2009). This is a critical issue given that the lack of adjusted and/or updated data for a specific population may increase the risk of misdiagnosis (Ardila, 2005; Fern\u00e1ndez & Marcopulos, 2008). In Spain, different normative data studies for older adults have been carried out for verbal fluency tests and the ROCF and TMT tests (Benito-Cuadrado et al., 2002; Contador et al., 2016; Del Ser Quijano et al., 2004; Llin\u00e0s-Regl\u00e0 et al., 2017; Pe\u00f1a-Casanova, Qui\u00f1ones-\u00dabeda, Gramunt-Fombuena, et al., 2009; Pe\u00f1a-Casanova, Qui\u00f1ones-\u00dabeda, Quintana-Aparicio, et al., 2009; Pe\u00f1a-Casanova, Gramunt-Fombuena, et al., 2009; Peri\u00e1\u00f1ez et al., 2007). However, these normative studies have certain limitations, particularly in terms of the time that has elapsed since the generation of these normative data, as well as the sociodemographic characteristics of the sample. Thus, there was considerable heterogeneity in the cohort in some studies, including young and old participants or with no participants older than 80 years of age (Peri\u00e1\u00f1ez et al., 2007), whereas others included participants with diseases that may affect cognitive function (Llin\u00e0s-Regl\u00e0 et al., 2017), or some subjects with MCI (Pe\u00f1a-Casanova, Qui\u00f1ones-\u00dabeda, Gramunt-Fombuena, et al., 2009; Pe\u00f1a-Casanova, Qui\u00f1ones-\u00dabeda, Quintana-Aparicio, et al., 2009; Pe\u00f1a-Casanova, Gramunt-Fombuena, et al., 2009; Pe\u00f1a-Casanova, Blesa, et al., 2009). Importantly, the aforementioned normative studies for older Spanish adults included recruitment areas where there is some bilingualism in relation to the Spanish language (Castilian), with a second official local language (Basque, Galician, or Catalan) (Benito-Cuadrado et al., 2002; Llin\u00e0s-Regl\u00e0 et al., 2017; Pe\u00f1a-Casanova, Qui\u00f1ones-\u00dabeda, Gramunt-Fombuena, et al., 2009;\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /acn/article/37/5/952/6492653 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 17 January 2024\nPe\u00f1a-Casanova, Qui\u00f1ones-\u00dabeda, Quintana-Aparicio, et al., 2009; Pe\u00f1a-Casanova, Gramunt-Fombuena, et al., 2009; Peri\u00e1\u00f1ez et al., 2007), or they may have included bilingual participants, a phenomenon that might have influenced the results and that was not considered when generating the normative data (Benito-Cuadrado et al., 2002; Contador et al., 2016; Del Ser Quijano et al., 2004). Hence, following the recommendation of continuous norming and to avoid the use of outdated normative data (Evers, Sijtsma, Lucassen, & Meijer, 2010), and taking into account the present evidence of studies indicating that bilingualism can affect performance in verbal fluency tests, we considered there was a need to generate updated uniform normative data on monolingual Spanish-speaking for some of the neuropsychological assessment tools used frequently on older adults.\nAs such, the main objective of the present study was to produce updated uniform normative data for a subset of widely used neuropsychological assessment tools. Specifically, we examined the effects of age, the years of formal education, and sex in verbal fluency tests and in the TMT (A and B) and ROCF tests (copy time and copy accuracy) in a large sample of cognitively healthy monolingual Spanish-speaking older adults from the Autonomous Community of Madrid (Spain)."

These participants were already enrolled on a larger, ongoing, longitudinal research study to investigate psychosocial factors associated with cognitive function and to determine the prevalence and progression of MCI. All the participants were between 60 and 90 years, and they were living independently, were educated in Spain, and were reported only speaking Spanish. The exclusion criteria applied were previously diagnosed MCI or a neurological condition that potentially causes neuropsychological deficits (e.g., traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, stroke, brain tumor, and Parkinson\u2019s); a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE-Spanish version MEC-35) score \u2264 24 (Lobo, Ezquerra, G\u00f3mez Burgada, Sala, & Seva D\u00edaz, 1979); a severe sensory deficit; any metabolic disease (e.g., diabetes mellitus, obesity, and hypothyroidism); a history of psychiatric diseases (e.g., bipolar mood disorder and depression); and the use of any drug that may affect cognitive function. Participants were also excluded if the shortened Spanish version of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) (Yesavage, Javaid, & Sheikh, 1986) returned a value \u22656, or the Blessed Dementia Scale (BDS)-part A (Blessed, Tomlinson, & Roth, 1968) produced a value >3.5.

In order to take into account potential confounds associated with demographic characteristics of our cohort, we recruited older men and women with a sex distribution similar to that of the older general population in Spain. In addition, we attempted to include participants with a wide level of education, ranging from 0-illiterates to 22 years of education (0 years = illiterates; 1\u20136 years = primary education; 7\u201311 years = secondary education; 12\u201314 years = high school; 15\u201316 years = Bachelor\u2019s degree; 18 years = Master\u2019s degree; 19 years = Master\u2019s degree plus professionally qualified; 20 years = doctorate; 21\u201322 years = doctorate plus professionally qualified).\nThe study protocol was approved by the ethical committee of the UNED and it fulfills the requirements of the European Community Council Directive 2001/20/EC and the Helsinki Declaration regarding biomedical research involving humans. All the subjects were interviewed in order to collect their personal and sociodemographic data and to record their health status. The verbal fluency tests, TMT, and ROCF were administered by neuropsychologists as part of a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment."

Participants were asked to produce as many words as possible in a specific time interval according to established phonemic or categorical criteria. The phonemic fluency test involves generating words starting with the same letter, such that the subjects were asked to provide as many words as possible in 1 min beginning with the letter /p/ (Pe\u00f1a-Casanova, 1991). The semantic fluency test involves generating words from a specific semantic category, asking the subjects to provide as many names of animals as possible\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /acn/article/37/5/952/6492653 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 17 January 2024\nin 1 min (Battery for Semantic Memory Deterioration in Alzheimer\u2019s Disease\u2013EMSDA) (Peraita Adrados, Gonz\u00e1lez Labra, S\u00e1nchez Bernardos, & Galeote Moreno, 2000). In both tests, the number of words produced was recorded, excluding errors and repetitions.\nTrail Making Test A and B (TMT A & B) (Reitan & Wolfson, 1993). In the TMT-A, the participants were instructed to draw lines between the numbers 1 and 25 in an ascending order, linking the numbers in circles scattered on a standard page. In part B, which is a more complex task, the participant had to handle two codes, numerical and alphabetic, and the goal is to connect alternately and consecutively the sequence of numbers and letters (1-A, 2-B, 3-C, etc.). Again, the participants were instructed to connect the circles as quickly as possible. Both parts A and B were carried out after an initial trial test to ensure that the subject understood the instructions. If the subjects made a mistake, they were alerted to the failure and instructed to return to the last correct target. Performance in the TMT was assessed by the time to complete parts A and B of the test, with longer times indicating greater impairment.\nRey\u2013Osterrieth Complex Figure (ROCF) test (Osterrieth, 1944; Rey, 1941). In the ROCF test, the subject must copy the figure shown on a separate sheet of paper as accurately as possible, without leaving out any details and taking into account the proportions. In this study, the accuracy of the figure copied was assessed. The ROCF is made up of 18 elements and two points were awarded when the elements were correctly reproduced; one point was given when the reproduction was incomplete but properly situated or completed but poorly placed, and a score of zero was given when elements were absent or not recognizable. The maximum score is 36 points and there is no time limit for this task. The copy time (in seconds) and copy accuracy (score) for reproduction of the Rey figure were computed."

            "text": "All the analyses were carried out with the IBM SPSS Statistics 25 package. The uniform normative procedure that we applied was the same as that used previously in the MOANS projects (Ivnik et al., 1992; Lucas et al., 2005) and in the Spanish NEURONORMA studies (Pe\u00f1a-Casanova, Blesa, et al., 2009). This procedure allows the scores of the conormative tests to be directly compared with each other, facilitating a clinical interpretation and neuropsychological classification. The uniform normative procedure was followed:\n.\n1. The overlapping interval strategy (Pauker, 1988) was adopted to maximize the number of subjects contributing to the normative distribution at each midpoint age interval. Each midpoint age group provided norms for individuals of that age, plus or minus one year, but they were derived from a subsample of all the participants who were within five years of the midpoint age. This strategy is frequently used in the literature, particularly in normative studies in which age has an effect (Lavoie et al., 2013). The age distribution of the cohort yielded seven midpoint age groups: 60\u201366, 67\u201369, 70\u201372, 73\u201375, 76\u201378, 79\u201381, and 82\u201390 (see Supplementary material online, Table S1). 2. The main effects of age, education, and sex in the different neuropsychological tests (verbal fluency animals, /p/, TMT-A, TMT-B, ROCF accuracy score, and copy time) were assessed separately through a correlation analysis. The coefficients of correlation (r) and determination (R2) of raw scores with age, years of education, and sex were calculated (Lucas et al., 2005). 3. Tables of age-adjusted normative values were created. The frequency distribution of the raw score was transformed into an age-adjusted scaled score (SSA) to ensure a normal distribution adjusted for the effect of age (Ivnik et al., 1992; Pe\u00f1a-Casanova, Blesa, et al., 2009). Thus, a cumulative frequency distribution of the raw scores was generated for each age range, such that percentile ranks could be assigned to direct scores based on their place within a distribution. As such, the percentile rankings were converted to an SSA score, that is, the scaled score from 2 to 18 (Ivnik et al., 1992). This transformation normalizes the distribution (mean = 10 and SD = 3), making it possible to perform several linear regression analyses to calculate adjusted scaled scores of the sociodemographic variables. 4. Age-adjusted scaled scores were adjusted for the number of years of formal education reported by participants. The effect of the years of education was modeled using the following formula defined by Mungas, Marshall, Weldon, Haan, and Reed (1996): SSAE = SSA\u2013(\u03b2 \u2217[Education(years)\u201312]). In this equation, the age scaled scores (SSA) obtained for each test were adjusted according to the difference between the predicted scores based upon the subject\u2019s actual education and the predicted score given 12 years of education. Although this value of 12 years of formal education selected by Mungas and colleagues (1996) was arbitrary, it was used as it yielded a relatively standard reference point. In addition, other normative studies on Spanish populations have reported that 12 years of education is a critical cutoff for upper education (Guardia et al., 1997; Guardia, Jarne, Pe\u00f1a-Casanova, & Gil, 2005). After adjusting for age and education, significant sex differences were only observed in the TMT-B subtest, indicating the need to control the effect of sex for this assessment tool (Ivnik et al., 1992). Accordingly, the effect of sex was adjusted in the SSAE TMT test using the following equation (Pe\u00f1a-Casanova, Qui\u00f1ones-\u00dabeda, Quintana-Aparicio, et al., 2009): SSAES = SSAE\u2013(\u03b3 \u2217Sex).\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /acn/article/37/5/952/6492653 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 17 January 2024\nTable 1..

Moreover, the SSAES were calculated for TMT-A and TMT-B, and the adjusted scores are presented (see Tables 12\u201319), whereby the SSAES value obtained was rounded down to the nearest integer using the TRUNC (variable) function (i.e., 10.75 becomes 10).\nIn order to establish an individual\u2019s total SSAE value, a two-step process is required.

With all the tests studied, a decline in performance was detected with increasing age and lower educational level, indicating the importance of using age- and education-adjusted normative data for these tests. In addition, we observed a significant effect of sex on performance in the TMT test, with men outperforming women, evidence of the need to also adjust the normative data for sex in this test.\nIn older populations, accurate assessment of executive functions is critical to detect and track cognitive performance as it progresses from normal cognition to MCI, and on to dementia (Aretouli et al., 2013; Clark et al., 2012; Mez et al., 2013).

Specifically, increasing age and a lower educational level were associated to poorer performance in terms of phonemic and semantic fluency, findings that are consistent with other normative studies (Acevedo et al., 2000; Benito-Cuadrado et al., 2002; Cavaco et al., 2013a; Contador et al., 2016; Machado et al., 2009; Pe\u00f1a-Casanova, Qui\u00f1ones-\u00dabeda, Gramunt-Fombuena, et al., 2009; Vogel, Stokholm, & J\u00f8rgensen, 2019).

Other normative studies also failed to present evidence for sex effects on phonemic fluency (Benito-Cuadrado et al., 2002; Cavaco et al., 2013a; Pe\u00f1a-Casanova, 2009a; Tombaugh, Kozak, & Rees, 1999), although the evidence for effects of sex on semantic fluency remains controversial. As far as we know, only one study indicated sex differences associated with animal fluency (Contador et al., 2016), whereas the remaining normative studies did not observe a significant effect of sex on animal fluency (Acevedo et al., 2000; Capitani, Laiacona, & Barbarotto, 1998; Pe\u00f1a-Casanova, Qui\u00f1ones-\u00dabeda, Gramunt-Fombuena, et al., 2009; Tombaugh et al., 1999). Nevertheless, there is evidence that women outperform men in certain semantic categories assessed in verbal fluency tests (i.e., \u201cfruits and vegetables\u201d and/or \u201ckitchen tools\u201d) (Acevedo et al., 2000; Contador et al., 2016; Pe\u00f1a-Casanova, Qui\u00f1ones-\u00dabeda, Gramunt-Fombuena, et al., 2009).

In agreement with other normative studies, the time to complete the TMT test increased with age and decreased with years of formal education (Cangoz, Karakoc, & Selekler, 2009; Cavaco et al., 2013b; Ivnik et al., 1996; Llin\u00e0s-Regl\u00e0 et al., 2017; Pe\u00f1a-Casanova, Qui\u00f1ones-\u00dabeda, Quintana-Aparicio, et al., 2009; Rodr\u00edguez-Lorenzana et al., 2021; Tombaugh, 2004). In addition, when the effects of age and education were controlled for, we still found that women performed worse than men in the TMT test, so sex-adjusted scores were also generated in the normative data for this test. Our results are consistent with some previous normative studies on the TMT test in which a significant sex effect was indicated (Bornstein, 1985; Cangoz et al., 2009; Cavaco et al., 2013b; Llin\u00e0s-Regl\u00e0 et al., 2017; Seo et al., 2006; Strauss, Sherman, & Spreen, 2006).

Indeed, the inclusion of subjects with subtle cognitive deficits in normative studies, which later became AD, produces an underestimation of the mean performance in cognitive tests, leading to an overestimation of the variance and the effect of age (Sliwinski, Lipton, Buschke, & Stewart, 1996). Thus, strict inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to the participants of the present study to guarantee that the normative data were not affected by the aforementioned causes. In contrast to our study, in obtaining earlier normative data for TMT, subjects suffering from diseases that can affect cognitive function were included (i.e., depressed mood, diabetes, mellitus or myocardial infarction) (Llin\u00e0s-Regl\u00e0 et al., 2017), whereas the NEURONORMA project also included participants with MCI when attempting to develop diagnostic norms (Pe\u00f1a-Casanova, Qui\u00f1ones-\u00dabeda, Gramunt-Fombuena, et al., 2009;\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /acn/article/37/5/952/6492653 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 17 January 2024\nPe\u00f1a-Casanova, Qui\u00f1ones-\u00dabeda, Quintana-Aparicio, et al., 2009; Pe\u00f1a-Casanova, Gramunt-Fombuena, et al., 2009; Pe\u00f1a\u2013 Casanova, Blesa, et al., 2009).\nIn addition, we consider monolingualism an important criterion in the elaboration of the normative data. In this regard, it has been indicated that bilingual subjects perform better than monolingual individuals in some nonverbal tests of executive functions, whereas monolinguals outperform bilinguals in verbal fluency tests (Bialystok et al., 2012; Grundy & Timmer, 2017), although there is still some debate in the literature about the differences between monolingualism and bilingualism in terms of executive functions (Massa, K\u00f6pke, & El Yagoubi, 2020; for a review see Grundy & Timmer, 2017; and Paap et al., 2015). Bearing in mind that previous Spanish normative data studies like NEURONORMA recruited 39.9% of participants that did not use Castilian (Spanish) as their first language (Pe\u00f1a-Casanova, 2009d), and that other studies were entirely carried out in a geographical area where two official languages coexist (Catalan and Castilian) (Benito-Cuadrado et al., 2002; Llin\u00e0s-Regl\u00e0 et al., 2017), we considered that it was important to develop normative data for several widely used neuropsychological tests using a monolingual cohort. Because the NEURONORMA project provides uniform age- and education-adjusted norms for the tests that we analyzed in this study, we decided to compare them with our present normative data. Thus, conversion of a given raw score in TMT-A or TMT-B to age- and education-adjusted scores yielded similar results in our normative data when compared to NEURONORMA study (Pe\u00f1a-Casanova, Qui\u00f1ones-\u00dabeda, Quintana-Aparicio, et al., 2009). Previous studies found no significant differences in TMT performance between monolingual and bilingual older adults (Anderson, Saleemi, & Bialystok, 2017; Goral, Campanelli, & Spiro, 2015). However, it is important to indicate that sex-adjusted scores for TMT resulted in a slightly better score in women in our normative data when compared to NEURONORMA (Pe\u00f1a-Casanova, Qui\u00f1ones-\u00dabeda, Quintana-Aparicio, et al., 2009), highlighting the relevance of adjusting the norms of this task for a sex-effect to improve the accuracy of the cognitive diagnosis in older female adults. Concerning the ROCF copy accuracy and time to copy, our present normative data in monolinguals also yielded very similar results to the NEURONORMA study (Pe\u00f1a-Casanova, Gramunt-Fombuena, et al., 2009), which may suggest that bilingualism does not significantly affect performance in this task, consistent with earlier studies (St\u00e5lhammar, Hellstr\u00f6m, Eckerstr\u00f6m, & Wallin, 2020). Finally, an examination of the adjusted scores in phonemic and semantic fluency tests indicated that a given raw score consistently resulted in a slightly lower score in the age- and education-adjusted scales here than in the normative scores of the NEURONORMA study (Pe\u00f1a-Casanova, Qui\u00f1ones-\u00dabeda, Gramunt-Fombuena, et al., 2009). Hence, it may be that monolingual subjects outperform bilingual subjects in these verbal fluency tests. Indeed, there is abundant evidence indicating that bilingualism is associated to lower verbal fluency scores than monolingualism (Anderson et al., 2017; Gollan, Montoya, & Werner, 2002; Roberts, Garc\u00eda, Desrochers, & Hernandez, 2002; Rosselli et al., 2000). Different facets may account for this disadvantage of bilingual individuals, including competition account (Abutalebi & Green, 2007), frequency lag account (Gollan et al., 2011), and a degree of interference between languages (Rosselli et al., 2000).\nWe consider that our normative data will help to track age-related cognitive decline and improve diagnostic accuracy, reducing the risk of misdiagnosis, especially in cases of suspected dysexecutive MCI or any other neurodegenerative pathologies (e.g., AD) (Pe\u00f1a-Casanova, Qui\u00f1ones-\u00dabeda, Gramunt-Fombuena, et al., 2009; Tsatali et al., 2020). In this regard, it is important to establish evidence-based cutoff points for cognitive tasks in order to discriminate between normal and pathological agerelated cognitive decline. In the absence of dementia and in combination with subjective memory complaints, MCI is assigned to cognitive scores at least 1.5 SD below expected levels and in accordance with the sociodemographic characteristics of the individual (Petersen et al., 2001). Given that the uniform scalar scores are distributed from 2 to 18, with 10 being the midpoint value, adjusted scores lower than 6 would correspond to performance below normal, which could raise the alarm to deficits in performing the specific tests analyzed here.\nThe present study has some limitations, one of which is related to the selection of the participants and in particular, to the limited representation of individuals at the extreme age ranges (aged between 75 and 90 years old). This reflects the difficulties in recruiting healthy volunteers over 75 years of age to participate in such studies. As in other studies, some of the participants with a very low level of education refused or could not perform some of the tests, in particular the TMT-B and ROCF. On the other hand, in our cohort, we attempted to include people with a wide range of ages and educational levels, which contributes to the reliability of the normative data presented. Despite no data were collected about the individual\u2019s educational background and no specific neuropsychological test was used to measure the quality of education, the demographic characteristics of our cohort and the fact that all were born in Spain and they were all educated in a similar educational system lead us to believe that there is little heterogeneity in the quality of education received by the participants. Although quality of education is usually thought to be relevant in multicultural studies in which the years spent in the education system explain only a small proportion of the variation found in the data (Manly, Byrd, Touradji, & Stern, 2004), further studies will be necessary to fully address this issue. Consequently, the updated norms presented are only appropriate for Spanish monolingual older adults, which must be taken into consideration when contemplating applying these norms to people from other Spanish-speaking countries where cultural and linguistic differences may be relevant.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /acn/article/37/5/952/6492653 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 17 January 2024"
