1. **Investigate the effects of various divalent cations on the kinetics of myosin and troponin in real-world conditions.** This could be done using in vitro assays or animal models to measure the effects of different cations on muscle contraction and relaxation.


2. **Examine the potential role of EF-hand proteins and the myosin ATP-binding pocket as molecular targets for toxic cations.** This could involve studying the binding of different cations to these proteins and assessing the effects of this binding on protein function.


3. **Explore the potential for using divalent cations as therapeutic agents for cardiovascular diseases.** This could involve investigating the effects of different cations on the progression of heart disease or the development of new drugs that target EF-hand proteins or the myosin ATP-binding pocket.


4. **Investigate the potential role of divalent cations in the development of cardiovascular diseases.** This could involve studying the relationship between exposure to different cations and the incidence of heart disease or the development of animal models of cardiovascular disease that are induced by exposure to specific cations.


5. **Examine the potential for using divalent cations as biomarkers for cardiovascular diseases.** This could involve investigating the levels of different cations in the blood or urine of patients with heart disease or the development of new diagnostic tests that measure the levels of specific cations in the body.
