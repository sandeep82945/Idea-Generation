1. **Investigate the effect of fiber orientation on dispersion:** The current study focused on the effect of fiber bundle morphology on dispersion, but it did not consider the effect of fiber orientation. Future research could investigate how the initial orientation of the fibers within the pellet affects the dispersion process and the resulting fiber distribution. This could be done by using pellets with different fiber orientations or by applying a controlled shear flow to the pellets prior to dispersion.


2. **Study the dispersion of fiber bundles with different aspect ratios:** The current study only considered fiber bundles with a circular cross-section. Future research could investigate the dispersion of fiber bundles with different aspect ratios, such as elliptical or rectangular cross-sections. This would help to determine how the shape of the fiber bundle affects the dispersion process and the resulting fiber distribution.


3. **Explore the use of different dispersion techniques:** The current study used a simple shear flow to disperse the fiber bundles. Future research could investigate the use of different dispersion techniques, such as extensional flow, compression flow, or ultrasonic dispersion. This would help to determine which dispersion technique is most effective for different types of fiber bundles and different processing conditions.


4. **Investigate the effect of fiber-matrix interactions on dispersion:** The current study did not consider the effect of fiber-matrix interactions on dispersion. Future research could investigate how the surface properties of the fibers and the matrix material affect the dispersion process and the resulting fiber distribution. This could be done by using fibers with different surface treatments or by using different matrix materials.


5. **Develop a model for predicting fiber dispersion:** The current study provides experimental data on fiber dispersion, but it does not provide a model for predicting the dispersion process. Future research could develop a model that can predict the dispersion of fiber bundles in a given processing environment. This model could be used to optimize the dispersion process and to design new materials with improved fiber dispersion.
