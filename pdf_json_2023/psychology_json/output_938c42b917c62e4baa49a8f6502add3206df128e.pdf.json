A. coriandriodora rhizome is popularly utilized in traditional Chinese medicine and as flavouring spices, but there are few reports on its constituents and bioactivities. This study analyzed the phytochemical components of A. coriandriodora rhizome by GC-MS and UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap-MS and evaluated its antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-enzymatic properties. According to the GC-FID/MS data, its rhizome essential oil (EO) consisted mainly of (E)-2-decenal (53.8%), (E)-2decenyl acetate (24.4%), (Z)-3-dodecenyl acetate (3.5%), and (E)-2-octenal (3.5%). Its water extract (WE) and 70% ethanol extract (EE) showed high total phenolic content (TPC, 52.99\u201360.49 mg GAEs/g extract) and total flavonoid content (TFC, 260.69\u2013286.42 mg REs/g extract). In addition, the phytochemicals of WE and EE were further characterized using UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap-MS, and a total of sixty-three compoundswere identified, including fourteen phenolic components and twentythree flavonoid compounds. In the antioxidant assay, WE and EE revealed a potent scavenging effect on DPPH (IC50: 6.59 \u00b1 0.88 mg/mL and 17.70 \u00b1 1.15 mg/mL, respectively), surpassing the BHT (IC50: 21.83 \u00b1 0.89mg/mL). For the antimicrobial activities, EO displayed excellent antibacterial capabilities against Proteus vulgaris, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus with DIZ (12.60\u201322.17 mm), MIC (0.78\u20131.56 mg/mL), and MBC (3.13 mg/ mL) and significantly inhibited Aspergillus flavus growth (MIC = 0.313 mg/mL, MFC = 0.625 mg/mL, respectively). In addition to weak tyrosinase and cholinesterase inhibition, EE and WE had a prominent inhibitory effect against aglucosidase (IC50: 0.013 \u00b1 0.001 mg/mL and 0.017 \u00b1 0.002 mg/mL), which was significantly higher than acarbose (IC50: 0.22 \u00b1 0.01 mg/mL). Hence, the rhizome of A. coriandriodora has excellent potential for utilization in the pharmaceutical and food fields as a source of bioactive substances.\nKEYWORDS\nAlpinia coriandriodora, phytochemical analysis, antioxidant, antimicrobial, enzyme inhibition\nfrontiersin.org01"

            "text": "Alpinia (Zingiberaceae) has approximately 250 species and is mostly distributed in subtropical and tropical Asia (WFO, 2023). Alpinia is widely cultivated for its rhizome, which is consumed in fields of folk medicine, condiment, perfume, and food (Yang and Eilerman, 1999; Victo\u0301rio, 2011; Ibrahim et al., 2014). Alpinia plants are abundant in essential oil (EO) and are frequently used to treat cancer, ulcer, neural disorders, diabetes, and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (Ghosh and Rangan, 2013; Rajasekar et al., 2014; Shi et al., 2015). Numerous bioactivities of the Alpinia plant\u2019s essential oils and extract have been reported, including anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, insecticidal, neuroprotective, antioxidant, antifungal, and analgesic activities (Ghosh and Rangan, 2013; Van et al., 2021).\nAlpinia coriandriodora D. Fang., also known as sweet ginger, is a perennial plant with a distinctive coriander fragrance that is extensively cultivated in China due to its medicinal and edible value (Wu and Larsen, 2000; Cheng et al., 2021). A. coriandriodora rhizome is used as traditional Chinese medicine for treating fever, asthma, cold, stomachache, and indigestion (CHMC-Chinese Herbal Medicine Company, 1994; Zhang and Li, 2015; Wu et al., 2016). Moreover, its rhizome was utilized as spices in the preparation of soups and stews. Interestingly, wrapping zongzi with its leaves is a specialty of residents in Guangxi, China. In previous studies on A. coriandriodora rhizome, several diarylheptanoids and flavonoids were isolated, and these compounds had intracellular antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions by inhibiting NO release (Cheng et al., 2021). A. coriandriodora is rich in essential oil, and its EO has been used in traditional medicine (Tran et al., 2022). Previous research indicated that A. coriandriodora rhizome EO was mainly composed of (E)-2decenal (60.4\u201356.3%) and (E)-2-decenyl acetate (19.6\u20134.3%) and possessed potent anticancer and anti-malassezia effects (Hong et al., 2022; Tran et al., 2022).\nDespite its high edible and medicinal value, there are few reports on the phytochemistry and biological activities of A. coriandriodora rhizome, which may hinder its utilization. Thus, this study analyzed the phytochemical constitution of A. coriandriodora rhizome using GC-FID/MS and UHPLC-QOrbitrap-MS and evaluated its antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-enzymatic properties."

EO exhibited broad-spectrum antibacterial activity with DIZ values ranging from 12.60 to 22.17 mm. Previous studies suggest that MIC values less than 5 mg/mL have potent antibacterial properties (Monteiro et al., 2021). Hence, the EO displayed a strong antibacterial effect against P. vulgaris (MIC = 1.56 mg/mL, MBC = 3.13 mg/mL), E. faecalis (MIC = 0.78mg/mL,MBC=3.13mg/mL),B. subtilis (MIC=0.78mg/mL,MBC = 3.13mg/mL), E. coli (MIC= 0.78mg/mL,MBC= 6.25mg/mL) and S. aureus (MIC = 0.78 mg/mL, MBC = 3.13 mg/mL). In addition, it revealed moderate antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa (MIC = 6.25 mg/mL, MBC = 6.25 mg/mL). (E)-2-Decenal, as the predominant component, has been proven to possess broad-spectrum antibacterial action, withMIC values ranging from 7.8 to 500 mg/mL against E. coli, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Salmonella typhi, S. enteritidis, Bacillus cereus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and S. pyogenes (Bisignano et al., 2001; Trombetta et al., 2002).

Thus, the antibacterial action of A. coriandriodora EO can be attributed to these main components. Bacterial infections and the emergence of bacterial resistance have threatened human public health around the world (Fernandes et al., 2022).

A. flavus is known to cause spoilage of vegetables, grains, fruits, and nuts, which results in huge economic losses worldwide (Hashem et al., 2022). In addition, aflatoxin produced by A. flavus poses a great threat to human health due to its immunosuppressive, genotoxic, and carcinogenic effects (Lasram et al., 2019; Yadav et al., 2019). Recent studies have suggested that essential oils can be used as a greener alternative to protect foods fromAspergillus flavus contamination (Dutta et al., 2020; Kundu et al., 2022).

AD (Alzheimer\u2019s disease) is a chronic disease withmemory loss and cognitive impairment caused by central nervous system degeneration, and low levels of cholinergic energy in the human brain play an essential role in the pathogenesis of AD (Sharma, 2019). As shown in Table 6, compared with the positive control galanthamine, EO, WE, and EE of A. coriandriodora rhizome showed weak AChE (IC50: 5.84 \u00b1 0.48 mg/mL, 6.67 \u00b1 0.04 mg/mL, and 1.59 \u00b1 0.09 mg/mL, respectively) and BChE (IC50: 5.73 \u00b1 0.33 mg/mL, 3.61 \u00b1 0.89 mg/mL, and 0.38 \u00b1 0.02 mg/mL, respectively) inhibitory activity.\nIn mammals, tyrosinase is a crucial enzyme in the production of melanin, which protects against UV damage, but excessive melanin can lead to many skin problems, such as malignant melanoma, freckles, and age spots (Brenner and Hearing, 2008; Sun et al., 2017). Tyrosinase inhibitors have been extensively applied in cosmetic and medicine\nindustries to solve these problems. According to the results presented in Table 6, EO (IC50: 1.01 \u00b1 0.08 mg/mL, 253.12 \u00b1 9.13 mg AREs/g sample) had the most strong tyrosinase inhibition, followed by WE (IC50: 8.91 \u00b1 1.69 mg/mL, 29.78 \u00b1 5.61 mg AREs/g sample) and EE (IC50: 19.85 \u00b1 3.74 mg/mL, 13.21 \u00b1 2.71 mg AREs/g sample). (E)-2octenal, as the main components of A. coriandriodora rhizome EO, have been demonstrated to possess tyrosinase inhibition (Kubo and Kinst-Hori, 1999). Plant-derived flavonoids and phenolic compounds can serve as natural inhibitors of tyrosinase (Goncc\u0327alves and Romano, 2017). A variety of phenolic and flavonoid compounds identified from WE and EE, such as orsellinic acid, arctigenin, and hordenine, have been confirmed to possess tyrosinase inhibitory activity (Kim et al., 2013; Park et al., 2013; Lopes et al., 2018). Thus, the tyrosinase inhibition of A. coriandriodora rhizome can be attributed to the presence of these active ingredients.\nThe a-glucosidase inhibitors can decrease the intake of postprandial carbohydrates by reducing the digestion of carbohydrates and are an effective means of treating type II diabetes (Gao et al., 2022). Nevertheless, synthetic a-glucosidase inhibitors, such as voglibose, emiglitate, miglitol, and acarbose, have unacceptable consequences, including flatulence, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, and allergic reactions (Liu et al., 2015; Hossain et al., 2020). Hence, there is an urgent need to find more effective and safer natural products as aglucosidase inhibitors. As illustrated in Table 6, the inhibitory effects ofA. coriandriodora rhizome ona-glucosidase were as follows: EE (IC50: 0.013 \u00b1 0.001 mg/mL) > WE (IC50: 0.017 \u00b1 0.002 mg/mL) > acarbose (IC50: 0.22 \u00b1 0.01 mg/mL) > EO (IC50: 3.30 \u00b1 0.17 mg/mL) (p < 0.05). Notably, thea-glucosidase inhibitory capacity ofWE (19.92 \u00b1 1.19mmoLACEs/g sample) and EE (25.87 \u00b1 2.32 mmoL ACEs/g sample) was significantly higher than acarbose (p < 0.05).\nPrevious studies have indicated that phenolic compounds and flavonoids can act as potent a-glucosidase inhibitors (Goncc\u0327alves and Romano, 2017). Various phenolic and flavonoid compounds identified from A. coriandriodora rhizome, such as hordenine (Su et al., 2018), p-\ncoumaric acid (Amalan et al., 2016), procyanidin A2 (Sheikh et al., 2019), eupatilin (Kang et al., 2008), and acacetin (Wang et al., 2023) were obviously lowered fasting blood glucose level of diabetic mice. In addition, protocatechualdehyde (Ji et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021), hyperoside (Ku et al., 2014; Luo et al., 2021), quercetin (Vessal et al., 2003; Nurul Islam et al., 2013), and isoquercitrin (Zhang et al., 2018; Luo et al., 2021) displayed significant anti-diabetic properties in vivo and a-glucosidase inhibitory properties in vitro that were stronger than the positive control acarbose. Furthermore, epicatechin (Lin et al., 2022) and pectolinarigenin (Amin et al., 2017) showed stronger inhibitory efficacy against a-glucosidase compared to acarbose. These phenolic and flavonoid compounds may contribute to the potent a-glucosidase inhibition of A. coriandriodora rhizome WE and EE. Hence, A. coriandriodora rhizome WE and EE could be utilized as a novel source of a-glucosidase inhibitors for the functional food and pharmaceutical industries."
