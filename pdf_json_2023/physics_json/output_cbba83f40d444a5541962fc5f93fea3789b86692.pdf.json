    "abstractText": "Dicofol is a highly toxic residual pesticide in tea, which seriously endangers human health. A method for detecting dicofol in tea by combining stoichiometry with surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) technology was proposed in this study. AuNPs were prepared, and silver shells were grown on the surface of AuNPs to obtain core\u2013shell Au@AgNPs. Then, the core\u2013shell Au@AgNPs were attached to the surface of a PDMS membrane by physical deposition to obtain a Au@AgNPs/PDMS substrate. The limit of detection (LOD) of this substrate for 4-ATP is as low as 0.28 \u00d7 10\u221211 mol/L, and the LOD of dicofol in tea is 0.32 ng/kg, showing high sensitivity. By comparing the modeling effects of preprocessing and variable selection algorithms, it is concluded that the modeling effect of Savitzky\u2013Golay combined with competitive adaptive reweighted sampling\u2013 partial least squares regression is the best (Rp = 0.9964, RPD = 10.6145). SERS technology combined with stoichiometry is expected to rapidly detect dicofol in tea without labels.",

            "text": "Tea is the second-most-popular drink around the world after water and is known for its unique aroma and texture [1,2]. As the birthplace of tea, China has a rich tea culture and is one of the world\u2019s largest tea producers and major exporters [3]. Tea is diverse and contains a variety of organic compounds and inorganic mineral elements [4]. Studies showed that regularly drinking tea can combat several chronic devastating disorders such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and neurological diseases [5,6]. During the growth of tea, people use different kinds of pesticides to fight pests and diseases. Organochlorine pesticides are the most widely used class of synthetic organic pesticides so far [7]. However, this type of pesticide is chemically stable and has a long residue time in the environment, causing serious environmental pollution [8,9]. Dicofol is a highly effective organochlorine pesticide that has been widely used in agricultural pest control [10]. However, it is not easy to degrade under natural conditions. It is also known to be toxic and harmful, can cause human liver dysfunction and carcinogenic symptoms, and has long been banned in China. However, as the residue period increases, pesticides have a cumulative effect in the soil and are sometimes detected in certain water quality\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5291. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28145291 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5291 2 of 16\nand soil samples. Dicofol is still detected in some teas as pesticide residues in water and soil can be immersed in tea leaves along with tea plants, endangering human health. GB 2763-2021 stipulates that the maximum residue limit of dicofol in tea is 0.2 mg/kg. The highly efficient and sensitive detection of dicofol in tea reduces the risk of contaminated tea entering the production and circulation links from the source and has certain social and economic application value. The detection and analysis methods of organochlorine pesticides mainly include liquid chromatography and gas chromatography [11,12]. Although these methods have high sensitivity and good reproducibility, the preprocessing steps are complex, the detection efficiency is low, and the detection cost is high [13]. In addition, the requirements for operators are high, so it is not suitable for the detection of large-scale experimental samples [14,15]. Therefore, it is necessary to establish an efficient, economical, and sensitive detection method to detect dicofol in tea. Raman scattering is caused by the vibration of functional groups within molecules, and different functional groups produce different characteristic vibration energy levels; thus, each molecule has its own unique Raman spectrum, which we call the fingerprint characteristics of Raman spectroscopy [16]. However, the signal intensity of the Raman spectrum is weak (only 10\u22126 of incident light), which is difficult to observe. The discovery of the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) effect made the application of Raman spectroscopy possible. SERS technique relies on the local electromagnetic enhancement caused by the plasmon resonance on a rough metal surface or the charge transfer between metal nanomaterials and target analytes to amplify the Raman signal of the target analytes. [17\u201319]. SERS technology has a wide range of applications in medicine, food safety, and the life sciences [20\u201322]. The preparation of high-performance SERS substrates is particularly critical to the development of SERS technology [23,24]. The precious metals gold and silver are commonly used as enhanced substrates in SERS detection and analysis [25]. Gold nanoparticles have high stability, while silver nanoparticles have high sensitivity, and their morphology and size are controllable, have good reproducibility, and can be uniformly adsorbed on target molecules, with superior surface-enhanced Raman properties. The gold\u2013silver core\u2013shell nanostructure integrates the advantages of the two precious metals, the stability is good, and the sensitivity is further improved; thus, the application range is wider [26]. PDMS film is a commonly used flexible material for supported metal nanoparticles, with good flexibility and tensile properties, strong corrosion resistance, and good stability, and is an ideal substrate material [27\u201329]. This study proposed a method for the rapid and highly sensitive detection of dicofol in tea by combining core\u2013shell Au@AgNPs and PDMS film (Figure 1). After a flexible PDMS membrane is immersed in 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) solution, the surface is modified with a certain quantity of amino acids, which can better bind to core\u2013shell Au@AgNPs [30,31]. At an excitation wavelength of 638 nm, the Raman spectra of the gradient concentration of the tea samples added with dicofol standard substance on a Au@AgNPs/PDMS substrate were acquired, and a linear relationship was established. The results showed that in the linear range of 10\u2013100 ng/kg, there was a strong correlation between the concentration of dicofol and the SERS signal intensity. To eliminate the influence of noise interference and further improve the correlation, the original spectrum is preprocessed, and the variable selection algorithm is used. The best combination of models for the quantitative detection of dicofol in tea was determined by comparing Rp and RSD. SERS technology combined with stoichiometry is expected to rapidly detect dicofol in tea without labels.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5291 3 of 16Molecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 16\n2.1. Optimization of AuNPs and Au@AgNPs\nThe enhancement of the SERS signal is mainly caused by the local electric field enhancement of the plasma on the metal surface. Therefore, the controllability and uniformity of the particle size and distribution in nanoparticle systems is the key to constructing SERS substrates with strong stability, high sensitivity, and a uniform signal [32]. This study prepared AuNPs with different particle sizes and grew silver shells with different thicknesses on the surface of AuNPs to obtain core\u2013shell Au@AgNPs. Figure S1a\u2013f are TEM characterizations of AuNPs prepared by adding different volumes (150, 200, 250, 300, 350, and 400 \u03bcL) of trisodium citrate to HAuCl4 solution. It can be observed that when 150 and 200 \u03bcL of trisodium citrate are added, the synthesized AuNPs are uneven in size, with particle sizes of 80 nm and 50 nm, respectively. When the volume of trisodium citrate increased from 250 \u03bcL to 300, 350, and 400 \u03bcL, the shape of the AuNPs gradually approached a spherical shape, and the particle size decreased from 34 nm to 25, 23, and 19 nm, respectively.\nThe thickness of the silver shell is determined by the volumes of the AgNO3 and ascorbic acid. Figure S1g\u2013l shows the TEM images of core\u2013shell Au@AgNPs prepared by dropping different amounts of AgNO3 and ascorbic acid in AuNPs (34 nm) solution. It can be observed that the core\u2013shell Au@AgNPs\u2019 center is darker, and the edges are brightly colored, which accords with the characteristics of the core\u2013shell nanostructure [33,34]. The thickness of the Ag shell increased from 3 nm to 4.5, 5.5, 9, 11, and 15 nm when AgNO3 and ascorbic acid were added at 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, and 105 \u03bcL, respectively.\n2.2.

The intensity of the blank tin foil, blank PDMS, and blank Au@AgNPs/PDMS substrates is less than 100, and the influence on the subsequent detection of the target substances is negligible. The TEM results of the Au@AgNPs/PDMS substrate are shown in Figure 2g, where the core\u2013shell Au@AgNPs is spherical and uniformly distributed on the PDMS membrane. The diameter of a single core\u2013shell Au@AgNP is about 45 nm. To evaluate the SERS-enhanced effect of the Au@AgNPs/PDMS substrate, 4-ATP solution (10\u22126 mol/L) was dripped onto the tin foil and SERS-enhanced substrate, and the Raman spectrum was collected (Figure S2b). The band intensity of the 4-ATP located around 1078 cm\u22121 is 278 on the tin foil and 41,702.3 on the reinforced substrate. It can be seen that the Au@AgNPs/PDMS substrate has a good SERS-enhancement effect. In addition, the original Raman spectra of the 4-ATP on the tin foil showed significant Raman peaks at 473, 876, 1087, and 1588cm\u22121.

There are few related studies on dicofol, so the reference materials are limited. Density-functional theory (DFT) was applied to calculate the standard Raman spectra of dicofol to confirm the theoretical distribution of the Raman peaks and to verify the accuracy of the experimental spectra [45]. The molecular configuration of dicofol was constructed using Gauss View 6.0. The theoretical Raman spectra of dicofol were calculated using the B3LYP/6-311 G (D, P) group of the B3LYP method of DFT. The calculation results of the dicofol Raman frequency were checked on the Gauss View 6.0 software platform, and the corresponding correction factors were used for correction. The standard Raman spectrum of dicofol calculated by DFT is shown in Figure S2c. The spectral curves of eight gradient concentrations of dicofol are shown in Figure 3c. The higher the content of dicofol is, the higher the Raman intensity of the tea sample is. The Raman spectra of dicofol on tin foil and Au@AgNPs/PDMS show that Raman peaks exist at 489, 888, 1055, 1094, and 1463 cm\u22121 and 489, 619, 709, and 1261cm\u22121, respectively.

Figure 4a(I) shows the periodic variation rule of RMSECV, which reaches the minimum value of 3.008 in the 30th cycle. After removing the irrelevant variables from the model, the RMSECV value gradually increases. Figure 4a(II) shows the periodic variation rule of the regression coefficient. The regression coefficient values for the first 15 cycles were close to zero. After that, the regression coefficient of the strong competition variable increases, while that of the weak competition variable decreases.

In this study, the entire spectrum is divided into 10 subintervals.

A method for detecting dicofol in tea by combining stoichiometry with surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) technology was proposed in this study. The core\u2013shell structure can combine the advantages of the two metals, while the PDMS film has good flexibility and strong corrosion resistance. Therefore, we prepared core\u2013shell Au@AgNPs with excellent enhancement properties, high stability, and high sensitivity. Then, core\u2013shell nanoparticles were attached to the surface of the PDMS by physical deposition, and the Au@AgNPs/PDMS substrate was prepared. A Au@AgNPs/PDMS substrate has excellent stability and reproducibility and can detect a 10\u221211 mol/L 4-ATP signal, showing high sensitivity. This may be due to the high enrichment of the core\u2013shell Au@AgNPs on the PDMS membranes resulting in more SERS \u201chot spots\u201d. This substrate was used for the SERS detection of dicofol in tea, and a standard curve was established. R2 = 0.9791, indicating a good correlation between the Raman intensity and sample concentration. Considering the influence of noise and sample complexity on spectral intensity, the spectral data were processed by chemometrics. The algorithm modeling effect of SG smoothing combined with CARS-PLS was the best (Rp = 0.9964, RMSEP = 2.9268, and RPD = 10.6145). The use of chemometric algorithms effectively removed the influence of redundant information and improved the modeling effect. In summary, the highly efficient and sensitive SERS detection method for dicofol in tea proposed in this study had good repeatability and was easy to operate. Therefore, it has broad application prospects in medicine, food safety, the life sciences, and other fields.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5291 11 of 16"

Then the preparation of gold and silver core\u2013shell nanoparticles was carried out: 6 mL of optimized gold nanoparticle solution (34 nm) was taken in a test tube, and 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, and 105 \u00b5L of ascorbic acid solution with a concentration of 10 mmoL/L were added after 10 min of ultrasonication. After shaking at 1000 rpm for 2 min, add the same concentration of AgNO3 solution. Refrigerate at 4 \u25e6C after 7 min of continuous shaking. After that, the amination functionalization of the PDMS membrane was carried out. Piranha solution (H2SO4:HNO3 = 3:7 (v/v)) was added to the PDMS film. Shake for 10\u201330 s, take out the PDMS film, clean with ultrapure water, blow dry with high-purity nitrogen, repeat this step 3~4 times, and then put it in a clean surface dish. Hydroxylated PDMS films were soaked in APTES ethanol solution (5%, v/v) for 3 h (70 \u25e6C). Amine-functionalized PDMS film was obtained after washing with ultra-pure water and drying. Finally, the core\u2013shell Au@AgNPs were deposited in aminated PDMS by physical method to form Au@AgNPs/PDMS film.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5291 12 of 16"

            "text": "SERS spectra of experimental samples were acquired using a confocal Raman microscopy system, and spectral data were processed using LabSpec6 software (Lab Spec_6_5_2) inside the system. The excitation power used in the experiment was 400 mW, the cumulative number of sample acquisitions was 1, and the acquisition time was 1 s. All Raman spectra were obtained under a 10\u00d7 objective with an excitation wavelength of 638 nm. Using 4-ATP as the signaling molecule, the enhanced effects of the prepared gold nanoparticles, core\u2013shell Au@AgNPs, and Au@AgNPs/PDMS were investigated. To analyze the SERS-enhanced effect of gold nanoparticles of different sizes, 10 \u00b5L of 4-ATP (0.1 mmol/L) solution was mixed with 990 \u00b5L of AuNPs. After 10 min, take 5 \u00b5L of the mixed liquid for Raman detection. In order to explore the effect of silver-shell thickness on the SERS performance of core\u2013shell Au@AgNPs, 10 \u00b5L of 4-ATP (0.1 mmol/L) solution was mixed with 990 \u00b5L of core\u2013shell Au@AgNPs. After 10 min, take 5 \u00b5L of the mixed liquid for Raman detection. Raman spectra of 4-ATP in six AuNPs with different particle sizes and six core\u2013shell Au@AgNPs with different silver-shell thicknesses were collected. An Au@AgNPs/PDMS substrate with a size of 6 mm \u00d7 6 mm was placed on tin foil for SERS testing. To investigate the sensitivity of the Au@AgNPs/PDMS substrate, different concentrations of 4-ATP solution (10\u22126, 10\u22127, 10\u22128, 10\u22129, 10\u221210, 10\u221211, and 10\u221212 mol/L) were added to the substrate for SERS detection. To investigate the reproducibility of the Au@AgNPs/PDMS substrate, 10 \u00b5L of 4-ATP (0.1 mmol/L) solution was dropped on the substrate, and 15 points were uniformly collected in mapping mode in a region of 3 mm \u00d7 2 mm, and the standard deviation was calculated. To explore the stability of the Au@AgNPs/PDMS substrates, three substrates were stored in closed Petri dishes, and Raman measurements were performed dropwise with 5 \u00b5L of 4-ATP (0.1 mmol/L) solution at 10, 20, and 30 days. Each substrate was uniformly collected from 25 points in the mapping mode in a region of 3 mm \u00d7 3 mm, and the intensity of the 25 points was averaged. Finally, the standard deviation of the three substrates was calculated. The SERS spectra of dicofol standard solution on tin foil were collected, and the SERS spectra of eight gradient concentrations (1, 10, 20, 30, 50, 70, 90, and 100 ng/kg) spiked tea samples on the Au@AgNPs/PDMS substrate were collected. The calculation method of dicofol content in tea samples is described in the supplementary materials.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5291 13 of 16\nDue to the complexity of tea samples and the variability of the external environment, the acquired spectra were affected by fluorescence interference and had a certain degree of baseline drift. Therefore, it was necessary to perform baseline processing and data smoothing on the acquired spectra to improve the spectral quality. The de-baseline parameters selected for this study were set as follows: background fit was polynomial, degree = 7, and maximum points = 256. In addition, control the data smoothing effect by changing the function type and parameters [46]. The function type selected for this study was Denoise, and the parameters were set as follows: degree = 1, and size = 1.\n4.7. Data Preprocessing and Models Development 4.7.1. Spectra Preprocessing\nTo minimize baseline drift and interference of redundant background information, Raman spectra were preprocessed by Savitzky\u2013Golay (SG), spectral multivariate scattering correction (MSC), variable normalization (SNV), first derivative, and second derivative. These preprocessing methods can better remove the noisy data in the spectrum and eliminate the baseline drift, which is significant to improve the prediction effect and generalization ability of the model. In this study, five methods were selected to preprocess the original Raman spectral data of dicofol and establish PLS model.\n4.7.2. Variable Selection\nMultivariate calibration methods can improve spectral modeling by selecting spectral variables. In this study, four variable selection algorithms were used to process the spectrum data of dicofol by synergy interval partial least squares method (SI-PLS), uninformed variable elimination algorithm (UVE-PLS), successive projection algorithm (SPA-PLS), and competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS-PLS). SI decomposes all variables into several equidistant subintervals and then combines 1, 2, or more subintervals to construct the model. The joint interval can compensate for the lack of information of a single interval and improve the accuracy of the model [47,48]. The UVE algorithm is based on PLS and can eliminate uninformative variables from the data [49]. SPA is a forward characteristic variable selection method, which can select the combination of variables with the leastredundant information content and least collinearity [50]. CARS treats each variable as an independent individual through adaptive weighted sampling and retains the variable with a larger weight as a new subset, which can effectively remove irrelevant variables and reduce the influence of collinear variables [51,52].\n4.7.3. Model Assessment\nFive pretreatment algorithms based on PLS model and four variable selection algorithms were combined to establish the best prediction model for dicofol concentration. The 120 spectral data (667 independent variables) were divided into 72 calibration sets and 48 test sets. The calibration set was used to build the partial least squares model, and the test set was used to verify the generalization ability of the evaluation model. The model was evaluated by correlation coefficient of calibration (Rc), root mean square error of calibration (RMSEC), correlation coefficient of prediction (Rp), and root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP). The smaller the RMSEC and RMSEP values were, the closer R was to 1, and the more accurate and stable the model was. Algorithmic processing of all SERS data took place in MATLAB 2016b."

The LOD for 4-ATP was 0.28 \u00d7 10\u221211 mol/L for this substrate and 0.32 ng/kg for dicofol in tea, which is much lower than the safe limit of dicofol in tea (200 ng/kg). The modeling effects of five preprocessing algorithms and four variable selection algorithms based on PLS model were compared. The algorithm combining SG and CARS-PLS modeled the dicofol data the best (Rp = 0.9964, and RPD = 10.6145). Combined with stoichiometry, SERS technology can be used for the efficient and sensitive detection of dicofol in tea.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28145291/s1.
