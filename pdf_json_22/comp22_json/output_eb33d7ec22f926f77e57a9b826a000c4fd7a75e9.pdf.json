Our first contribution is to provide a unified framework for reverse link (uplink) analysis where matched filters are applied at the FD base stations (BSs) under channel hardening. Second, we derive the expressions of the signal-to-quantization-plus-interference-plus-noise ratio (SQINR) for general and special cases. Finally, we quantify effects of quantization error, pilot contamination, and full duplexing for a hexagonal cell lattice on spectral efficiency and cumulative distribution function (CDF) to show that FD outperforms half duplex (HD) in a wide variety of scenarios.",

INTRODUCTION\nFull-duplex (FD) has emerged as a viable solution to enable efficient use of spectrum, double spectral efficiency, and reduce latency [1]. These benefits are achieved because the FD transceiver transmits and receives in the same resource block in time and frequency [2]. In addition, an FD transceiver reduces hardware costs by employing a single shared antenna array for both transmission and reception. Thanks to these advantages, FD has been deployed in fielded backhaul systems, prototyped for machine-to-machine communications and integrated access and backhaul systems, and supported in 3GPP release 17 of the cellular standard [3]\u2013[6].\nAlthough FD systems deserve attention, they are vulnerable to the loopback self-interference (SI) because of the simultaneous transmission and reception in the same resource block [7]. When an FD array transmits a signal, the signal is received by the transmitting FD array with much greater power than that signals from other transmitters. In this near-far problem, the SI signal is several orders of magnitude greater than the desired received signal, which renders the FD systems dysfunctional [8]. For example, in cellular networks wherein the BSs operate in FD mode, the SI is leaked from the transmit to the receive arrays of the BSs which makes the uplink users corrupted by the SI experience very low spectral efficiency [9].\nTo overcome this limitation, massive MIMO has emerged as a viable solution by employing large number of antennas, i.e.,\nThis work was supported by AT&T Labs and NVIDIA, affiliates of the 6G@UT Research Center within the Wireless Networking and Communications Group at The University of Texas at Austin.\nproviding enough degree of freedom to sustain enough spatial streams and suppress the SI as well as cellular interference [10]. By increasing the number of antennas in a rich scattering environment, the achievable rate can be enhanced without increasing the bandwidth [11].\nAlthough combining FD with massive MIMO may circumvent the near-far problem effect, employing a massive number of antennas may require high power consumption. This is the case for an all-digital systems wherein each RF chain and ADC/DAC is dedicated to a single antenna phase shifter [12]. To address this shortcoming, using low-resolution ADCs/DACs have been proposed as an efficient solution to reduce the power consumption with a tradeoff in reduction in spectral efficiency [13]\u2013[16].\nIn this work, we consider the modeling of FD massive MIMO cellular networks with low-resolution ADCs/DACs and pilot contamination. Pilot contamination occurs when users in a neighboring cell are using a non-orthogonal pilot sequence. The BSs are equipped with a massive number of antennas, operate in FD mode, and have low-resolution ADCs/DACs. The user equipments (UEs) have a single antenna, operate in half-duplex mode, and have full-resolution ADCs/DACs.\nSystem performance is simulated for hexagonal cellular lattice with two tiers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that proposes the modeling and analysis of reverse link (uplink) for FD massive MIMO cellular networks with low-resolution ADC/DAC under pilot contamination. The main contribution of this work is to take into account the many network irregularities and impairments so as to develop a comprehensive analytical framework as well as to show the feasibility of such a system.\nSection II presents the network model while analysis of the reverse link is provided by Section III. Numerical results are in Section IV and concluding remarks appear in Section V.\nNotation. Italic non-bold letters refer to scalars while bold lower and upper case stand for vector and matrix, respectively. We denote subscripts u for uplink and d for downlink."

Note that fk is the precoder applied at the BS that is pointing toward the k-th downlink UE.\nTheorem 1. For channel hardening and with matched filter receiver, the output SQINR of the k-th user is given by (13).\nsqinr MF k = \u03b12u\n( Pk Pu SNRuk )2\nN2a (\n1 + PkPu SNR u k +\n\u2211\n\u2113\u2208C P\u2113,k Pu SNRu\u2113,k\n)\nden MF\n(13)\nwhere C is the set of cells reusing the same pilots and den MF is given by (14). Note that PkPu is the power control coefficient and INR = PSI\u00b5 2 SI/\u03c3 2 is the interference-to-noise ratio.\nProof. Using the results of Corollary 1 and [13, Appendix A] and after some mathematical manipulations, we retrieve the expression of the SQINR in Theorem 1.\nWith sqinrk, k = 0, . . .K \u2212 1 are locally stable, the evaluation of the gross spectral efficiencies do not require averaging over the fading realizations, but rather it is directly computed as\nI\u0304k B = log ( 1 + sqinrk ) , k = 0, . . . ,K \u2212 1 (15)\nConsidering pilot overhead calls for an aggregation of the reverse and forward spectral efficiencies or a partition of the overhead between the reverse and forward links. Therefore, the effective reverse link spectral efficiency becomes\nI\u0304effk B =\n(\n1\u2212 \u03b2 Np Nc\n)\nlog ( 1 + sqinrk ) , k = 0, . . . ,K \u2212 1\n(16)\nwhere \u03b2 \u2208 [0, 1] is the fraction of pilot overhead ascribed to the reverse link, Np and Nc are the number of pilots per cell and the fading coherence tile, respectively.\nCorollary 2. To further characterize the spectral efficiency, we derive a new bound using the following formula. Assuming statistical independence between x and y, we have\nE\n[\nlog\n(\n1 + x\ny\n)]\n\u223c= log\n(\n1 + E[x]\nE[y]\n)\n(17)\nLemma 1. Assuming perfect channel state information (CSI), and applying Corollary 2, the output SQINR of the k-th uplink user (13) becomes\nsqinr MF\nk =\n( Pk Pu SNRuk )2\n(N2a +Na) (\n1 + PkPu SNR u k\n)\nden MF\n(18)\nWhile the terms related to the channel estimation error and pilot contamination in (14) vanish since the CSI is perfect.\nProposition 1. Considering a single-cell multiuser system (without any inter-cell interference) with perfect CSI, Corollary 2 entails the results for reverse link in [13].\nProposition 2. With channel hardening, without full-duplexing (HSI = 0), with full-resolution and matched filter receiver, the output SINR of the k-th uplink user is given by (19).\nRemark 1. Note that Proposition 2 entails the same result for reverse link derived in [20, Eq. (10.63)].\nLemma 2. When the power (SNRuk) of the k-th uplink user goes to infinity, the output SINR (19) converges to Na.\nThis SINR limit, caused by the channel estimation error, is incurred by the users with good conditions, i.e., having small shadowing and short distances from the associated BS. However, this limit is irreducible and cannot be overtaken by a matched filter receiver reliant on channel hardening.\nLemma 3. Neglecting the pilot contamination, the output SINR expression (19) can be reduced to (20).\nsinr MF k \u2248 Na\n( Pk Pu SNRuk )2\n(\n1 + PkPu SNR u k\n)(\n1 + \u2211\n\u2113\n\u2211Ku \u2113 \u22121\nk=0 P\u2113,k Pu SNRu\u2113,k\n)\n(20)"

Unless otherwise stated, the values of the system parameters are defined in Table II.\nFig. 1 illustrates the CDF of the average reverse link SQINR. When the number of downlink users is large (e.g. 20 users per cell) and hence there is significant SI power, the CDF performance reduces and vice-versa.

This is confirmed when employing omnidirectional BSs \u2013 the performance completely degrades and vice-versa. Fig. 2 plots the effective spectral efficiency vs. number of ADC/DAC quantization bits (b). Spectral efficiency increases with b and converges to a ceiling defined by the full-resolution scheme. The rate decreases when adopting low-resolution ADC/DAC (low b). In addition, spectral efficiency noticeably degrades for\n40W compared to 30W of SI power. Although FD is vulnerable to loopback SI, it outperforms the half-duplex mode, which is one of the goals of this work. Since the pedestrian model features a large fading coherence tile and hence low overhead, they achieve better effective spectral efficiency compared to the vehicle model (high mobility) that features small fading coherence tile and hence higher overhead."

            "text": "In this paper, we propose a unified model for reverse link full-duplex massive MIMO cellular networks with lowresolution ADCs/DACs under pilot contamination. By using matched filter receivers at the base stations, AQNM modeling for ADCs and DACs, and channel hardening, we analyze the SQINR CDF and spectral efficiency for two-tier hexagonal lattice. Using a proper scaling ratio of antennas over the number of users per cell rejects a large amount of interference; however, the SINR is limited by pilot contamination. Simulation results show quantization error and loopback selfinterference incur losses; however, this loss is compensated by employing a massive number of antennas. Finally, the proposed system outperforms the half-duplex mode in spectral efficiency, which is part of the goal of this work to show the feasibility of full duplex in cellular networks."
