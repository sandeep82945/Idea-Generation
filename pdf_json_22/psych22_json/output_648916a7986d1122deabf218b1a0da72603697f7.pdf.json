OHP applies the psychology principles to protect health, improve the quality of work life and promote the health and wellbeing of workers (Gil-Monte, 2014). The notion of health protection in this definition refers to the analysis and interventions to reduce the toxicity of workplaces and diminish the employees demands that could impact on their health (e.g., burnout). Moreover, health promotion refers to analyses and interventions that focus on providing individuals with diverse resources to deal with different types of environments so as to guarantee their wellbeing, while at the same time encouraging healthy work environments. The workplace is a privileged context of action to promote health (Commission of the European Communities, 2005). The intense transformation of work and employment in the past decades has been contributing to changes in organizational structures and processes that are influencing the health and wellbeing of workers in their work roles, as well as in their personal and families\u2019 roles and boundaries (International Labour Organization, 2016).\nThe challenge of OHP in the future is to explore the positive mechanisms and simultaneously continue to study the illness and distress felt by this cohort. Both approaches are complementary and only jointly can allow a more integrative and complete understanding of the relationships between work, organization, and workers. It was an honor for us to promote such an interesting Research Topic.

The main results show that organizational identification partially mediated the relationship between total rewards perception and work engagement.\nThe second contribution, published by Zhang X. et al., shows that burnout is prevalent among frontline healthcare workers fighting COVID-19. This study also explores the factors associated with burnout.\nFrom Spain, the authors Mart\u00ednez et al.bring a study that aims to analyze the relationships between the personality, positive and negative affects, and the coping strategies of nurses. Negative affects were a mediator in the relationship between personality and less adaptative strategies, whilst positive affects had a strong impact on the development of positive strategies.\nThe 1-year cross-lagged Baka and Prusik study investigates the effects of five types of job demands related to challenge and\nFrontiers in Psychology 02 frontiersin.org\nhindrance stressors on job burnout as well as the mediational role of work family conflict in Polish nurses.\nThe study Rewards of compassion: Dispositional compassion predicts lower job strain and effort-reward imbalance over a 11- year follow-up developed by Tolonen et al. examines (i) whether dispositional compassion predicts job strain and effort-reward imbalance (ERI) or the predictive relationship run from job strain and ERI to dispositional compassion and (ii) the effect of dispositional compassion on the developmental trajectory of job strain and ERI over a 11-year follow-up (2001\u20132012).\nThe study by Makara-Studzinska et al. is focused on the relationship between stress, burnout and employee personal resources in a sample of 546 call-takers and dispatchers from 14 public-safety answering point in Poland.\nThe study published by Zhang F. et al. analyzed the mediating effect of organizational identification on the relationship between psychological capital and job satisfaction.\nMishima-Santos et al. presented a study that analyzed work characteristics in remote work to wellbeing, using a two-stage multi-method approach.\nThe aim of the research published by Damasceno et al. is centered on the relationship between emotional carrying capacity and group innovation, considering affective commitment as the mediating variable with a sample composed of 625 members and their respective leaders.\nCook and Zill investigated the association between diabetes-related distress and work outcomes (burnout and job satisfaction) among employed people with type 1 diabetes.\nThe study published by Gulla and Golonka shows significant relationships between sensory processing sensitivity and resilience.\nTikkanen et al.\u2019s study focused on exploring individual variations in medicine doctoral candidates\u2019 wellbeing, in terms of experienced research engagement and burnout by using a person-centered approach.\nA study with social workers developed by Xie et al. supported a dual process by which JD-R affected both social workers\u2019 burnout and psychological distress through health impairment and motivation processes.\nUpadyaya et al. study examined three latent profiles of school principals\u2019 stress concerning stress concerning the ability of students, teachers, parents and principals to cope during the COVID-19 pandemic: high stress, altered stress and low stress.\nThe results obtained in the study by Figueiredo-Ferraz et al. provide empirical evidence for the mediator role of guilt in the relationship between the burnout syndrome and psychosomatic disorders in a sample of teachers from Spain and Portugal, and they contribute to the empirical validation of the model of burnout developed by Gil-Monte (Gil-Monte, 2005).\nThe contribution ofMatsushita and Yamamura examines the working hours of junior high school teachers in public schools and investigates the association between overtime work and stress responses across job titles.\nResults from Li and Wu show that underemployment is significantly related to the decline of self-rated health, increased depressive tendencies, and the prevalence of illness over a certain period.\nThe Cross-Sectional Study of Individual Learning Passion in Medical Education developed by Zhang S. et al. demonstrates that self-esteem significantly and positively influenced medical students\u2019 PsyCap, which fully mediated the relationship between self-esteem and harmonious learning passion.\nMakowska-T\u0142omak et al. bring a contribution related with a Blended Online Intervention based on cognitive behavioral therapy and social cognitive therapy.\nFinally, Yin et al.\u2019s study shows, for instance, that age, job burnout and worrying about expenditure were the three determinants for prehospital decision delay.\nThe Research Topic \u201cOccupational health psychology: From burnout to well-being at work\u201d presents considerable wealth in terms of the heterogeneity of authors and countries with contributions. In addition, the diversity of professional groups covered in the research and thematic areas is significant. We consider, therefore, that we have successfully achieved our objective by providing an opportunity for the sharing of interesting results and future avenues of research and applied implications regarding Occupational Health Psychology. The new avenues of research in this area need the contribution of each one of you for their recognition, not least because the improvement of work environments contributes to the health and wellbeing of workers and the healthy performance of organizations."
