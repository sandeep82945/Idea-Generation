Fermi arcs were first discovered in cuprates, and caused by the pseudogap1. Weyl semimetals provided another way to generate Fermi arcs by breaking either the time reversal symmetry (TRS)2 or inversion symmetry3 of a 3D Dirac semimetal, which can result in a Weyl semimetal with pairs of Weyl nodes that have opposite chirality4. The bulk-boundary correspondence associated with the Chern number leads to the emergence of Fermi arcs on the boundary3,5\u201311. Here, we present experimental evidence that pairs of magnetically split hole- and electron-like Fermi arcs emerge below the Neel temperature (TN), in the antiferromagnetic (AFM) state of cubic NdBi due to a novel band splitting effect. Whereas TRS is broken by the AFM order, both inversion and nonsymmorphic TRS are preserved in the bulk, precluding the possibility of a Weyl semimetal. The observed magnetic splitting is highly unusual, as it creates bands of opposing curvature, that changes with temperature and follows the antiferromagnetic order parameter. This is completely different from previously reported cases of magnetic splittings such as traditional Zeeman and Rashba, where the curvature of the bands is preserved. Therefore, our finding represents a new Fermionic state created by new type of magnetic band splitting in the presence of a longrange AFM order that are not readily explained by existing theoretical ideas.\nRare-earth monopnictides12\u201316 were recently proposed to host novel topological states17\u201319, and studied experimentally16,20,21. The bulk Fermi surface of cubic NdBi (Fig. 1a) is similar to other rare earth monopnictides15\u201317 and consists of several hole pockets at the center of the Brillouin zone and ellipsoidal electron pockets in each corner of the zone as shown in Fig. 1b, c. Magnetic susceptibility M/H as a function of temperature is shown in Fig. 1d. A clear maximum is seen around 24 K indicating the onset of magnetic ordering below that temperature, which leads to the clear loss of spin disorder scattering below this temperature in the electrical resistivity shown in Fig. 1e. The high temperature M(T)/H(T) data follow a Curie-Weiss behavior with Weiss temperature \u03b8 = 17.2 \u00b1 0.1 K and an effective moment \u00b5 = (3.2 \u00b1 0.1) \u00b5B, which is close to the expected value of 3.6 \u00b5B for a Hund\u2019s rule ground state multiplet, J=9/2. The inset of Fig. 1d shows the magnetization as a function of applied fields measured at 2 K. A linear behavior is observed up to applied fields of 50 kOe.\nBoth M/H(T) and M(H) behavior indicate an AFM ordering below TN = 24 K.\nThe measured Fermi surface in the paramagnetic (PM) state is shown in Fig. 2a, and the dispersion along selected cuts is shown in panels Fig. 2b, c. This is in good agreement with bulk band structure calculations (Fig. 1b, c). There are very broad areas of intensity in the proximity of EF , consistent with the mainly 3D character of the bulk bands. The lack of sharp features indicates that there are no significant presence of surface states near EF in the paramagnetic state.\nUpon cooling below TN , a long-range AFM order develops 22\u201324 and a new, very sharp features appear near EF that are consistent with the emergence of surface states as seen in Fig. 2d-f. A new set of electron pockets appear, one residing within the bulk electron pocket and the other near the corners of the bulk hole pockets. Even more interestingly, four new, very sharp, disconnected contours appear around the center of the zone. It should be noted that these features appear only in the AFM state, and there is not even a hint of their intensity in these parts of the momentum space above TN . These features are induced by the presence of the long-range AFM order and are not artifacts of the sharpening due to the enhancement of quasiparticle lifetime. The spectral intensity of these features appears only below TN and is increasing upon cooling. In fact, as discussed below, the band splitting and weight of these features follow order-parameter-like temperature dependencies below TN . The Fermi surface and band structure are fully 4-fold rotationally symmetric, and the apparent broadening of the arcs located along horizontal direction is due to larger data bins in this direction.\nWe examine the structure of the Fermi arcs by plotting the detailed dispersion along several cuts in the momentum space in Fig. 3. The band that gives rise to the Fermi arc displays a sharp dispersion over a relatively wide energy range close to the symmetry direction crossing the center of the zone shown in Fig. 3b. As we move away from symmetry direction, the energy range over which this band has sharp intensity decreases, and becomes limited to few tens of meV near the tips of the arcs. Beyond the tips of the arc (Fig. 3b #4) the sharp surface state intensity vanishes and only very broad 3D bulk band intensity is present (Fig. 3b #5 and #6). Although graphically the arcs may seem reminiscent of cuprates, the situation is completely different. In cuprates the band giving rise to Fermi surface is present at all temperatures and the pseudogap suppresses the spectral weight of the band only near EF , while leaving the higher binding energy portion unaffected 1, which\nis clearly not the case in NdBi.\nIn order to verify the intrinsic nature of Fermi arcs discussed above we need to exclude a possibility that portion of the Fermi surface is suppressed by polarization selection rules and matrix elements. We do this by performing measurements on the same cleaved surface after rotating the sample by 45 degrees. The Fermi arcs are still present in such obtained data at the same locations as before as shown in Fig. 3c, d. Detailed cuts provide further evidence that the band that gives rise to Fermi arcs merges with bulk bands, as shown in Fig. 3d. These data also reveal that there is a relation between the Fermi arc band and the surface state electron pockets that exist below TN as they appear to disperse together.\nPerhaps the most remarkable aspect of surface states described above is their formation below TN and temperature evolution. To illustrate this we plot in Fig. 4a, the Fermi surface and in Fig. 4b band dispersion along selected cut for several temperatures below and above TN . The data at 30 K and 25 K reveal only broad 3D bands and the surface states are completely absent. At 24 K, a hint of intensity appears in the band dispersion (indicated by red arrow). At 23K, there is clearly visible Fermi arc in the FS plot and slightly broaden linear dispersion. At 20 K, this Fermi arc splits into two, each having opposing curvature. The dispersion data reveals splitting of initial surface state band into hole-like and electron like bands. Their intensity vanishes away from \u0393, which forms the Fermi arcs. At 14K the separation between the two bands increases, mostly due to the upward movement of the electron-like band and rapid change of its curvature. At the same time its intensity near EF increases and the electron-like Fermi arc transforms into an electron pocket, area of which decreases with temperature (see two bottom panels of Fig. 4a.\nWe quantify the temperature evolution of the surface states by plotting the EDC\u2019s at a momentum near the bottom of the electron band as indicated by a dashed line in the bottom panel of Fig. 4b. Above TN , the EDC is a linear intensity cut-off by the Fermi function due to the projection of bulk bands. Just below TN , a small peak appears at \u223c70 meV. Its intensity is increasing upon cooling and a few degrees below TN , its splits into two peaks. The peak closer to EF is due to an electron-like band and the other one is due to a hole-like band. Upon further cooling, the \u201chole\u201d peak remains mostly at the same energy of \u223c85 meV (marked by dotted line in Fig. 4c), while increasing in intensity. The electron peak moves closer to EF and resides at \u223c38 meV at 5.5 K. In Fig. 4d we plot the area of both peaks after subtracting and normalizing by the EDC above TN . In Fig. 4e we plot\nthe energy separation between the EDC peaks as a function of temperature. In both cases those quantities behave in a manner similar to AFM order parameter.\nWe would like to emphasize the unusual nature of magnetic splitting we report here. In the regular Zeeman interaction, such as in an itinerant ferromagnet, presence of an internal magnetic field splits degenerate bands into minority and majority bands and rigidly shifts them up and down in energy as illustrated on the left side of Fig. 4f25. In the Rashba interaction, the spin momentum locking causes the degenerate band to split in a way that makes the products appear rigidly shifted along the momentum axis26, as illustrated on the right side of in Fig. 4f. In the case reported here, a linearly dispersing surface state that appears just below TN is split into two bands with opposed curvature: electron-like and hole-like as illustrated in Fig. 4g. Upon cooling and thus increase of internal magnetic field, the hole band remains mostly unchanged, while the curvature of the electron band increases as it moves to lower binding energies (Fig. 4g). This behavior is incompatible with known cases of magnetic splitting or presence of energy gap, as the latter would mostly affect adjacent portions of the bands.\nThe opposite band curvature of two bands and the sign-changing pattern of the dichroic response indicate that the surface states are massive Dirac fermions. Therefore, a possible scenario is that the surface spectrum features topological surface states. In this scenario, there are massless surface Dirac points protected by in particular C2zT symmetry in the paramagnetic state, where C2z is the 180 \u25e6 rotation around the surface normal direction, but they are masked because their spectrum overlap with the bulk spectrum. A pair of split electron-like and hole-like bands is then generated by the gap opening of each Dirac point due to C2zT breaking below TN . However, this does not explain how the gap opening enhances the spectral weight on the surface. More importantly, DFT calculations do not corroborate this scenario. Other ideas like the floating bands27 due to broken non-symmorphic time reversal symmetry on the surface are not supported by DFT calculations either.\nIn fact, our DFT calculations do not reproduce the experimentally observed band structure with the reported A-type AFM (AFMA)22,23, implying that any simple attempts based on band theory will fail. In Supplementary Information, we present the band structure and Fermi surfaces for AFMA (shown in Fig.1a) and also AFMC (intralayer checkerboard with out-of-plane moment) orders. No sign of surface states is found at the Fermi level for AFMA around the zone center. While surface states that are absent in the non-magnetic\nstate emerges for AFMC at 150 meV below EF , the overall band structure looks very different from the experimental data because AFMC clearly breaks C4 symmetry. While the mismatch between our experiment and DFT calculations implies that the correlation effect can play an important role, we do not observe a sign of the Kondo effect, which further underpins the puzzling nature of the observed surface states. Our observation suggests the existence of surface-resonant states in the continuum of bulk states, forming disconnected arcs at the Fermi level. However, the robustness of the surface resonance against the hybridization with the bulk bands is yet to be explained.\nIn any case, it is evident that magnetism and spin-orbit coupling are very important. As such, the delicate interplay with magnetism, spin-orbit coupling, and potential topology underlying the emergence of the Fermi arcs should provide a fascinating theory impetus, where all symmetries and specific processes need to be taken into account. Because the surface states we observe are intimately linked to the AFM order, they can be likely controlled by the application of magnetic fields as well as temperature pulses such as those present in ultrafast laser pulses, thereby opening new avenues for terahertz spintronics.\nREFERENCES\n\u2217 rjs269@cam.ac.uk \u2020 canfield@ ameslab.gov \u2021 adamkam@ameslab.gov; * - these authors contributed equally 1 Michael R Norman, Hong Ding, Mohit Randeria, Juan Carlos CAMPUZANO, T Yokoya, Tsune-\nhiro Takeuchi, T Takahashi, T Mochiku, K Kadowaki, P Guptasarma, and D G Hinks, \u201cDe-\nstruction of the Fermi surface in underdoped high-Tc superconductors,\u201d Nature 392, 157\u2013160\n(1998).\n2 Zhijun Wang, M.

Single crystals of NdBi were grown out of a Bi rich, binary melt. The elements, with an initial stoichiometry of Nd14Bi86, were put into a fritted alumina crucible28 (sold by LSP Ceramics as Canfield Crucible Sets29) and sealed in a fused silica tube under a partial pressure of argon. The thus prepared ampoule was heated up to 1100\u25e6 C over 5 hours and held there for 5 hours. This was followed by a slow cooling to 680\u25e6 C over 80 hours and decanting of the excess liquid using a centrifuge30. The cubic crystals obtained were stored and handled in a glovebox under a Nitrogen atmosphere. The magnetic measurements were carried out in a Quantum Design Magnetic Property Measurement System with applied magnetic fields up to 5 T. The ac resistivity measurements were done using the ACT option in a Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System. The measurement was done in the standard four point configuration and contacts were made using silver paint Dupont 4929, with contact resistance values of about 4-6 ohms. \u201d\nARPES measurements. ARPES data was collected using vacuum ultravilet (VUV) laser ARPES spectrometer that consists of a Scienta DA30 electron analyzer, picosecond Ti:Sapphire oscillator and fourth-harmonic generator31. Data from the laser based ARPES were collected with 6.7 eV photon energy. Angular resolution was set at \u223c 0.1\u25e6 and 1\u25e6, along and perpendicular to the direction of the analyser slit respectively, and the energy resolution was set at 2 meV. The VUV laser beam was set to vertical polarization, i. e. along k\u2019y direction. The diameter of the photon beam on the sample was \u223c 20\u00b5m. Samples were cleaved in-situ at a base pressure lower than 2\u00d7 10\u221211 Torr. Results were reproduced using several different single crystals and temperature cycling.\nDFT calculations. For the bulk band structure of non-magnetic NdBi calculated in Fig.1, we used PBE exchange-correlation functional in DFT including the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) with the 4f orbitals treated as core electrons as implemented in VASP. The experimental lattice constant of 6.41 A\u030a, a \u0393-centered Monkhorst-Pack (13\u00d713\u00d713) k -point mesh with a Gaussian smearing of 0.05 eV and a kinetic energy of 183 eV have been used. The DFT calculation for non-magnetic NdBi gives a band inversion around three X points and the associated topological surface states for a strong topological insulator, which are similar to those features in LaBi. However, ARPES data shows the absence of such surface\nstates in the paramagnetic NdBi above TN .\nDATA AVAILABILITY\nRelevant data for the work are available at the Materials Data Facility Ref. XX"

            "text": "To demonstrate that the states which appear below TN are indeed surface states, we present photon energy dependence of the band structure in this section. All data was acquired in the AFM state at T = 4.5 K\nIn Supplementary Fig. S3, we present high statistic Fermi surface maps measured with different photon energy from 5.7 eV to 6.89 eV near the BZ part where new states appear in the AFM state. Near the Fermi surfaces plots, we show one cut along \u0393-X direction and a cut in the direction orthogonal to it for each photon energy. No changes can be seen in the shape of the Fermi surface pockets nor in the corresponding dispersion plots. To show this precisely, we compared shapes of the disputations obtained by fitting energy distribution curves. The results are shown in Fig. S3. The curves match each other almost perfectly, well within experimental error bars. We note that for related compound YSb, the bulk band dispersion changes by more than 150 meV while tuning the photon energy from 5.5 eV to 6 eV15. Therefore the data in Fig. S3 demonstrates the surface state character of the features that appear in AFM state of NdBi.\nWe demonstrate that these surface states exist only in the AFM state and disappear above TN also when measured using higher photon energies in Fig. S4 a, b. These features produce sharp sets of peaks in momentum distribution curves (MDCs) below TN that sit on top of broad tail of intensity from bulk bands (Fig. S4 c). In the PM state, these peaks disappear and only broad tail of intensity due to bulk band projection.\n0.40.30.2\n-0.1\n0.0\n0.1\n0.40.30.2\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n-0.1 0.0 0.1\n-0.1\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n-0.1\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n-0.1\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n-0.1\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n-0.1\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n5.70 eV 6.05 eV 6.20 eV 6.44 eV 6.70 eV 6.70 eV 6.89 eV\n5.70 eV\n6.05 eV\n6.20 eV\n6.44 eV\n6.70 eV\n6.89 eV\n0.10\n0.05\n0.00\n0.40.30.2\nkx (1/\u00c5) kx (1/\u00c5) ky (1/\u00c5)\nk y (1\n/\u00c5 )\nBi nd\nin g\nen er\ngy (e\nV)\nMomentum (1/\u00c5)\nBi nd\nin g\nen er\ngy (e\nV)\na\nc\nb\nSupplementary Fig. 3.

            "text": "Polarization of incident photons has significant effects on intensity in ARPES experiments. It provides a powerful tool to decipher the character and origin of the observed bands. Performing ARPES experiments using circular polarization are particularly useful as they can provide valuable information about the possible existence of spin textures34. However this has to be carried out with care, as dichroic signal is expected to change sign across the experimental mirror plane (defined by sample normal and direction of incoming photon beam) even for trivial and core level states due to \u201dhandedness\u201d of photoemission process defined by vectors of incoming beam, sample normal and directions of outgoing photoelectrons35. Spin textures, such as present in topological insulators, manifest themselves by having opposite sign change across the mirror plane for the upper and lower parts of the Dirac cone34,36 as well as change of sign within the same band at momenta away from the mirror plane34.\nWe can confirm that the hole and electron surface states reported in this work have opposite dichroic response, where the sign of the CD signal for the two bands changes across the experimental mirror plane in an opposing way. This is illustrated in Supplementary Fig. S5 d, e. In addition, upon sample rotation by 45 deg, the sign of the dichroic signal changes within the same band at momenta away from the mirror plane, as evident in Supplementary Fig. S5 f. This is consistent with presence of opposite spin textures in hole and electron surface states as demonstrated previously34. We contrast this behavior with dichroism signal measured above TN in the PM state and shown in Fig. S5 i, j, where such effects are not observed.\nThe beam with circularly left (LCP), circularly right (RCP), linear horizontal (LH) or linear vertical (LH) polarization was produced using zero-order tunable phase retardation plate from Alphalas GmbH. The tilt of the plate was adjusted using a calibration curve and full circular polarization was verified using external polarimeter. The location of the beam at sample position was recorded for different polarization using phosphorescent plate, and movement of the beam during switching of polarization was corrected using beam deflector within half of the beam size.\nkx (1/\u00c5)\nk y (\n1/ \u00c5)\nk y (\n1/ \u00c5)\nBi nd\nin g\nen er\ngy (e V) Bi nd in g en er gy (e V)\nBi nd\nin g\nen er\ngy (e V) Bi nd in g en er gy (e V) 0 + \u2013\n-0.10 0.00 0.10\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n0.400.300.20\n-0.10\n0.00\n0.10\n-0.10 0.00 0.10\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n0.400.300.20\n-0.10\n0.00\n0.10\nMomentum (1/\u00c5)\n-0.10 0.00 0.10\n-0.10 0.00 0.10 Momentum (1/\u00c5)\nMomentum (1/\u00c5) 0.20.10.0-0.1-0.2\n0.20.10.0-0.1-0.2\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\n0.2\n0.1\n0.0\nMomentum (1/\u00c5)\n0.20.10.0-0.1-0.2\n0.20.10.0-0.1-0.2\na b c\nd e f\ng h\ni j\n8 K 25 K\n5 K 25 K\n8 K 25 K\n5 K 25 K\nSupplementary Fig. 5.

All maps demonstrate the presence of the surface state electron-like pocket and the arc.\nIn Supplementary Fig. S7b, We demonstrate how the surface state recovers after heating the sample up to T > TN and cooling it back down.

We gradually increased the temperature to 25K; at this temperature, the sample becomes paramagnetic, and the surface states are absent. After cooling down, the surface states recovered.

The magnetic ordering in NdBi is of AFM A type, which consists of planes that have the same orientation of magnetic moments that are stacked in AFM fashion along one axis.\nIf the AFM ordering vector is along the direction perpendicular to the sample surface i. e. along (001) direction, then MZB are horizontal planes (as illustrated in Supplementary Fig. S9b. In such case, the top and bottom electron pocket are back folded onto hole pockets at Gamma and vice versa. Since there are no states near EF that would be backfolded onto areas, where we observe the surface states, such scenario cannot be responsible for their emergence.\nMore interesting case happens, when the AFM ordering vector is parallel to the sample surface. Then there could be a potential overlap between central hole pocket and shadow bands of the electron pockets in the general area where surface states appear. This is schematically illustrated in Supplementary Figure S9c. Even then, the surface states we observe exist outside of the areas of the overlap between hole and electron shadow bands, as indicated by blue arrows, therefore they cannot be a result of hybridization due to band back folding.\nWe can also demonstrate that the back folding effects of the bulk bands are very weak in this material and below our detection limit. In Supplementary Fig. S10 we plot the data along cuts that are equally spaced on left and right side of the MZB. The back folding in AFM state should produce shadow bands and features from right side should appear in data on the left side and vice versa. We note that the bulk electron band from right PM cut (right top of panel b) , should appear with diminished intensity as shadow band overlap the PM data on the left cut (top left of panel b). The actual data in AFM state on the left side, does not show even a hint of such intensity that should exist below surface electron band. We illustrate this in more detail by plotting MDC\u2019s at EF and -40 meV in panels c and d. The bulk electron pocket produces strong shoulders marked by dashed lines. In presence of\nstrong band folding those shoulders should appear in the AFM MDC\u2019s from the left side of the MZB. Magnified data shows absence of such shoulders down to noise level, which puts upper limit on intensity of shadow bands of \u2264 3 %. This makes the band backfolding very unlikely to be responsible for emergence of the surface state Fermi arcs that have intensity that is comparable to intensity of PM bulk bands.\nWe illustrate difficulties with explaining the emergence of surface states in AFM state using the back folding scenario by simulating its effects and comparing to actual data in Supplementary Fig. S11. In top two panels we plot the data in PM state along the same cuts on left and right side of MZB as in Supplementary Fig. S10b. In panel c we plot data from panel a, after adding 10 % of intensity from panel b to simulate 10 % shadow band intensity. The result has clearly visible features indicated by an arrow that are missing from actual data in AFM state shown in panel d. The surface state electron pocket present in AFM state is not only much more intense, but also is located at different binding energy than the potential shadow band.\n1000\n800\n600\n400\n200\n0\n12001000800600400\n600\n400\n200\n0\n120010008006004002000\n1000\n800\n600\n400\n200\n0\n1600140012001000800600400\nParamagnetic\nAFM along (001)\nAFM along (100)\n600\n400\n200\n0\n120010008006004002000 1000\n800\n600\n400\n200\n0\n1600140012001000800600400\na\nb\nc\nSupplementary Fig. 9.

            "text": "For trying to understand the exotic magnetic Fermi arc and surface states observed by ARPES in NdBi below TN , we have carried out surface band structure calculations of different magnetic configurations based on DFT as shown in Supplementary Fig.S12, but so far none of them can explain the observed magnetic Fermi arc. First for the paramagnetic or non-magnetic (NM) state above TN , the NdBi (001) surface spectral function in Fig.S12(a) shows the band inversion along \u0393-M as projected from the avoided crossing with p \u2212 d band inversion in the \u0393-X direction of the bulk Brillouin zone (BZ). Such band inversion makes the NM NdBi a strong topological insulator with the topological index of Z2=(1;000), which is typical for NM early rare-earth (R) bismuth 1:1 compounds in the same rock salt structure17,37,38. Because of two bulk X points with the band inversion being projected on the same M point, two surface Dirac cones overlap and are gaped to form an upper and lower surface band crossing at the M point, which also agrees with earlier studies on paramagnetic RBi systems16,37\u201339. For the 2D Fermi surface (FS) at EF in Fig.S12(d), in comparison to the bulk-only FS in Fig.1C, the surface states around the M point connect and merge with the bulk electron pocket along the \u0393-M direction. At lower energy of EF \u2013 0.15 eV (Fig.S12(g)), these surface states form an envelope around the shrinking bulk electron pocket.\nFor the anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) configures below TN , we used the A-type AFM (AFMA) stacked along (001) with moment also along (001) as reported in the early neutron study by Nereson and Arnold23. Our DFT+U+SOC calculation with U=6.3 eV and J=0.7 eV gives a spin moment of 2.7 \u00b5B and an orbital moment of 5.8 \u00b5B in the opposite direction, resulting in a total magnetic moment of 3.1 \u00b5B on Nd, agreeing with the experimental data of 3.1\u00b10.2 \u00b5B23. Although time-reversal symmetry (TRS) is broken, the non-symmorphic TRS exists and when combined with inversion symmetry, the bulk bands still have double degeneracy. The calculated topological index Z4=2 and there is also a bulk Dirac point at EF + 0.4 eV being projected at the \u0393 point. For surface states, as shown in Fig.S12(b), the empty Nd 4f bands are 0.5 eV above the EF . The band inversion along \u0393-M still holds, but the two surface band crossings at the M point are both gaped out. In contrast to the hole Fermi arc and two surface electron pockets in the ARPES data in Fig.2E, Fig.S12(b) from the calculated AFMA shows no surface states extending beyond the band inversion region along the \u0393-M direction toward near the \u0393 point to merge into the bulk band projections.\nThe 2D FS of AFMA at different energies in Fig.S12(e) and (h) are similar to those in the NM case and do not match that of ARPES data in Fig.2D because of clearly missing the hole Fermi arc and the surface electron pocket on the \u0393 point side.\nTo evaluate the band-folding effect, we also considered the intralayer checkerboard AFM (AFMC) configuration with moment along (001) as shown in Fig.S12 (c), (f) and (i). For AFMC, the (001) surface BZ (SBZ) as drawn in Fig.S12(e) is rotated by 45 degree and folded in reference to that of NM and AFMA. As shown in Fig.S12(c), the band inversion along the original \u0393-M is folded at the half-point and on top of new M \u2032-point. The surface states of the overlapped Dirac cones at the original M -point are folded on top and centered at the \u0393 point. However, the surface states and the 2D FS at different energies in Fig.S12 (f) and (i) do not match the surface hole Fermi arc and two surface electron pockets in ARPES that appear along the \u0393-M on top of the well separated bulk hole and electron pockets in Fig.2E. For AFMC, the bulk electron pockets with the associated surface states are folded directly on top of the bulk hole pocket centered at the \u0393 point. Also notably the C4 rotational symmetry is broken because the stacking of the checkerboard AFM needs an in-plane non-symmorphic translation.\n!\" !# $% !\"!\" !# $% !\"\n(a)\n(d) (e)\n(b)\n(g) (h)\n(f)\n(c)\n(i)\n%\u2032 !# $\"\u2032 %\u2032\nEF EF EF\nEF-0.15eVEF-0.15eVEF-0.15eV\nSupplementary Fig. 12.
