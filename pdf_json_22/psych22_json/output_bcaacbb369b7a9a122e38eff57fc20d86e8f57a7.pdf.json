The first case of COVID-19 was reported in February 2020 by local authorities, and the WHO\u2019s preventive protocols were adopted by the Lebanese public health ministry policy6 to control the infectious pandemic. The Lebanese government imposed a lockdown from March 1, 2020, and consequently, all educational and working institutions were closed, forcing the people to be at home.7 Adults and children relied on technology to study, work, socialize, and spend long hours indoors, mainly in front of their screens.8 For adults, the benefits of technological progress in enabling work and so-"

Additionally, we investigated whether children\u2019s eating behavior while using electronic devices affects their physical and mental health. Methods We conducted an online survey asking for screen use (duration, type, and purpose), PA, eating habits, sleep problems, and level of depression. The participants were children between the ages of 3 and 7 years, and the survey was answered by the participants\u2019 parents from March 3 to March 20, 2021. Results A screen time of \u22652 h in children was associated with various clinical characteristics, such as body mass index (BMI), sleep problems, depression, decreased PA, and unusual eating habits. Children\u2019s food eating behavior while using electronic devices was predicted by a total screen time \u22652 h, smartphone screen time \u22652 h, sleep problems, owning electronic devices, and eating unhealthy food. Conclusion There was an interplay among children\u2019s PAs, eating behaviors, depression, sleep problems, and screen time in this pandemic era. Therefore, guiding children on the correct use of electronic devices and helping them eat healthy are paramount during this COVID-19 pandemic.

However, for children, some effects are worrisome. The concern that children spend an extended period of time on screen is not without basis, as excessive screen time means reduced physical activity (PA) and a prolonged sedentary lifestyle, which is associated with a negative impact on physical and mental health.9\nLong hours of screen time are associated with a short sleep duration, long sleep onset latency, and increased sleep deficiency.10 Screen time longer than 2 h is related to poor PA.11 Displacement hypothesis has been suggested, in which PAs are substituted for time spent in front of a screen.12 Screen time is also associated with unhealthy eating habits, including lower vegetable and fruit consumption, higher energy intake, and higher fast food and snack intake.13,14 Especially, eating while using electronic devices needs to be monitored with care in children. Screen viewing can distract children away from feeling physiologic satiety, leading to mindless eating and becoming overweight.11,15 The COVID-19 lockdowns have negatively influenced children\u2019s eating pattern and PA.16 Given the importance of sleep, eating, and PA in the development of children,17 these aspects need attention during the pandemic.\nMost studies on screen time of children have been conducted in well-developed countries.18 However, similar studies in developing countries, such as Lebanon, are minimal; particularly, the effect of lockdown on various health aspects requires investigation. Therefore, it is essential to determine the changes in screen time after lockdown to identify the predominant type of screen-based activity among children, and to study children\u2019s lifestyle changes. This study aimed to explore whether eating food while using electronic devices during the pandemic affected children\u2019s physical and mental health. To this end, we investigated the impact of digital screen time on various health aspects of children, assessing the effect of screen time and type (TV, cellphone, iPad, etc.) on PA, eating habits, sleep quality, and behavior. Furthermore, we examined which clinical characteristics were associated with eating behavior while using electronic devices during the lockdown."

Two additional questions about eating habits were asked to assess the degree of eating unhealthy food (does not consume, consume with moderation, or consumes excessively) and to determine whether the child ate the food while using a screen or not (never, sometimes, often, or always). Additionally, PA was assessed by asking a single question on how many days per week the child was active for at least 60 min (none, 1 day a week, less than half a week, more than half a week)."

In this study, we observed that children with screen time \u22652 h had various clinical characteristics, such as high BMI, sleep problems, depression, poor PA, and poor eating habits. Eating food while using electronic devices was associated with total screen time \u22652 h, smartphone screen time \u22652 h, sleep problems, owning electronic devices, and eating unhealthy food.\nRecent guidelines updated by the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in February 202021 suggest that children between 2\u20135 years of age can start to have an entertaining non-educational screen time outside of education, but it should be limited to approximately 1 h per weekday and 3 h on weekends. As for children aged \u22656 years, there are no strict guidelines on how much screen time they should get; however, parents should be careful that it does not interfere with their social relationships and responsibilities, and that they encourage healthy habits and limit activities that include a screen.21 In this study, we found that too much smartphone screen time (\u22652 h) was associated with a significant increase in the consumption of unhealthy food (p=0.037) and a high BMI (p=0.048). However, BMI showed no variation when other electronic devices were used. This is consistent with a study conducted in 2012, wherein excessive use of social media among preschool children was associated with a significant increase in BMI.22 Moreover, there were sleep problems among children with \u22652 h of screen time, as their total CSHQ-A score was significantly higher than that of children with <2 h of screen time on smartphones (p=0.008) and TV/PlayStation/Xbox (p= 0.021). This result also aligns with literature reviews where children with excessive screen use during the daytime or before bedtime experienced more sleep disturbances and had poor sleep quality.23,24\nThis study indicates that Lebanese children, with an excessive use of digital devices during the COVID-19 pandemic (\u22652 h per day), reported lower levels of total PA (except for TV/PlayStation/Xbox) for more than half of the days (Table 2).

In contrast, using screens diverts attention away\nData are presented as mean\u00b1standard deviation or N (%)\n226 Psychiatry Investig 2022;19(3):220-228\nfrom food, leading to a less accurate amount of food ingestion and nutritional composition, thus promoting caloric intake.29 In this study, we found that the proportion of children eating food while using digital devices was significantly higher among those with \u22652 h of screen time on smartphones and tablet/iPad. Moreover, among smartphone users, children with a screen time \u22652 h were prone to consume higher amounts of unhealthy food than children with screen time <2 h (13.5% vs. 6.3%). However, the effect of eating while using a screen is not limited to the unfavorable influences on the BMI, waist circumference, and not chewing properly; a key concern is that the action turns into a habit. It slowly grows into an addiction as the child finds himself/herself unable to let it go, and with time, developing the \u201celectronic screen syndrome,\u201d as named by Dr. Victoria Dunckley, author of \u201cRest your child\u2019s brain.\u201d30 As described by the writer, typical symptoms of this syndrome mimic psychological disorders such as stress, anxiety, sleep problems, irritability, and mood swings, and lead to behavioral changes and cognitive problems such as learning difficulties, poor memory, and concentration.\nConcerning sleep behavior, children using smartphones and TV/PlayStation/Xbox for more than 2 h were more prone to sleep problems. The present findings are in accordance with many studies; a recent one conducted among Tunisian children showed the negative effect of confinement on their sleep and that they experiences sleep disturbances.27 Another study among children in Iran noticed that children had a longer sleep duration when they had increased use of digital media.31 Furthermore, the relationships between sleep and mental health have been addressed in numerous publications. For example, sleep problems and insomnia have been associated with psychiatric depressive behaviors.32,33 Little is known about this topic among children, but one could predict that the same consequences would be seen. Our study found a significant correlation between sleep problems and depression in children, and about 40% of children with sleep problems suffered from depressive symptoms. Similarly, a recent study during the COVID-19 pandemic reported that adequate sleep in children resulted in fewer psychosocial problems.34 Therefore, previous\nstudies have highlighted the importance of healthy sleep on behavioral development35 and the quality of life in children.\nIn this study, we observed sleep problems in younger children similar to those in other studies among young children in Italy36 and Switzerland,37 where children\u2019s sleep was more harmed by the implementation of confinement compared to adults. In addition to the age impact on sleep patterns, our findings showed that girls had more sleep problems, which corresponds with a recent study that confirmed the relationship between human sleep behavior and sex differences, mostly near puberty. Another study showed similar findings among Tunisian children where girls had more sleep problems and poor sleep quality.27 Indeed, we can explain these sex differences considering the hormonal changes that affect the sleep architecture across the lifespan, including childhood. In our study, sleep disturbance in children was significantly correlated with the possession of their own electronic devices; approximately 60% of children with sleep problems had their own electronic devices (data not shown). Our results are consistent with those of another study on touchscreen usage and changes in sleep patterns.38 Other studies showed the association of having a TV in the bedroom with nonoptimal sleep, and confirmed previous findings on the negative impact of video devices on sleep.39 However, a study among children in Italy did not reveal an association between media availability, usage with changes in nighttime waking, and latency to fall asleep.40 Since children are experiencing a change in their daily habits, sleep problems have been reported in children with less PA. A study revealed associations between sleep and lifestyle factors, including diet quality and PA levels. However, there is either moderate or insufficient evidence that daily habits, such as PAs, are associated with sleep disturbances. Therefore, further studies are needed to obtain more insights on the social and environmental determinants of healthy sleep among children.\nRegression analysis indicated that eating food while using electronic devices was associated with total screen time \u22652 h, smartphone screen time \u22652 h, sleep problems, owning electronic devices, and eating unhealthy food. From this study, we can infer that children\u2019s eating habits while using a screen are\nwww.psychiatryinvestigation.org 227\nrelated to excessive screen time, especially with smartphones, sleep problems, and eating unhealthy food. Although we could not determine the causal relationship, we speculate that guiding children not to eat while using screen time is vital to keep them healthy during this pandemic. As the ownership of electronic devices can influence their behavior, parents need to set the policy of owning, using, and controlling the electronic device\u2019s screen time for children\u2019s mental and physical health during this pandemic.\nThere are some limitations to this study. First, the study was conducted via an anonymous online survey, which may have resulted in a bias. Furthermore, parents answered the questions, and the reported answers might lack some accuracy. The screen time estimated by the parents may differ from the exact screen time of their children. Second, parenting styles or parenting practices were not measured, which can affect screen time and eating habits of children. Third, only a single item question with dichotomous activity time was used for assessing PA, which may be insufficient. Fourth, 2 h of screen time was defined as a critical screen time in this study based on the guideline.21 Defining the appropriate screen time for children was not the objective of this study. However, 278 of 383 (72.6%) participants spent more than 2 h on screen time in this study. In this modern era, where online and digital education is gaining popularity, the appropriate screen time needs to be further discussed. Finally, this study was conducted during the peak of the pandemic in Lebanon, where the changes in symptoms (sleep problems and depression) and behaviors (eating behaviors and PA) may be affected by social distancing rather than screen time. In addition, economic crises and the Beirut explosion in August 2020 were also stressful for the Lebanese population, affecting their psychological health.\nDespite the limitations, we observed an interplay among children\u2019s PAs, eating behaviors, depression, sleep problems, and screen time, in this pandemic era. Primarily, children\u2019s behavior of eating food while using electronic devices was significantly related to sleep problems, smartphone screen time, and consumption of unhealthy foods. Therefore, guiding children with their use of electronic devices and helping them eat healthily are important during the COVID-19 pandemic."
