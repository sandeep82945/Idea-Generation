    "abstractText": "Cellular senescence serves as a fundamental and underlying activity that drives the aging process, and it is intricately associated with numerous age-related diseases, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), a neurodegenerative aging-related disorder characterized by progressive cognitive impairment. Although increasing evidence suggests that senescent microglia play a role in the pathogenesis of AD, their exact role remains unclear. In this study, we quantified the levels of lactic acid in senescent microglia, and hippocampus tissues of naturally aged mice and AD mice models (FAD and APP/PS1). We found lactic acid levels were significantly elevated in these cells and tissues compared to their corresponding counterparts, which increased the level of pan histone lysine lactylation (Kla). We aslo identified all histone Kla sites in senescent microglia, and found that both the H3K18 lactylation (H3K18la) and Pan-Kla were significantly up-regulated in senescent microglia and hippocampus tissues of naturally aged mice and AD modeling mice. We demonstrated that enhanced H3K18la directly stimulates the NF\u03baB signaling pathway by increasing binding to the promoter of Rela (p65) and NF\u03baB1(p50), thereby upregulating senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) components IL-6 and IL-8. Our study provides novel insights into the physiological function of Kla and the epigenetic regulatory mechanism that regulates brain aging and AD. Specifically, we have identified the H3K18la/NF\u03baB axis as a critical player in this process by modulating IL-6 and IL-8. Targeting this axis may be a potential therapeutic strategy for delaying aging and AD by blunting SASP.",

            "text": "Cellular senescence is a complex process involving factors that lead to a decline in cell growth and proliferation, ultimately resulting in the irreversible arrest of the cell cycle. This includes replicative senescence (caused by replicative exhaustion), and premature senescence (caused by oncogene activation or chemotherapeutics treatment) [1]. Cellular senescence is the foundation and premise of tissue, organ, and even organismal aging [2, 3]. In addition, the expression of functional proteins, and the synthesis and release of cytokines are abnormal in senescent cells, which leads to the functional decline of tissues and organs [4]. Studies show that cellular senescence is the main pathogenic mechanism and a potential \u2020Lin Wei and Xiaoweng Yang have contributed equally to this study. *Correspondence: Yan Ding dyywzx@163.com Aiqing Yu Yaq1989@hunnu.edu.cn 1 Department of Clinical Laboratory, Hunan Provincial People\u2019s Hospital, Central Laboratory of Hunan Provincial People\u2019s Hospital, The FirstAffiliated Hospital of Hunan Normal University, Changsha 410000, China 2 Hubei Key Laboratory of Embryonic Stem Cell Research, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Hubei University of Medicine, Taihe Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Hubei University of Medicine, Shiyan 442000, China\ntherapeutic target of brain aging and neurodegeneration diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) [5, 6], Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) [7, 8] and osteoarthritis (OA) [9\u201312], etc. However, the role and mechanism of cellular senescence in aging and aging-related diseases require further research.\nAD is a neurodegenerative disease associated with aging, characterized by progressive cognitive impairment. The deposition of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques and tau neurofibrils are two typical pathological features of AD, which are the main events and causes of neuronal loss, ultimately leading to cognitive decline in AD [13, 14]. As the global population ages, the number of AD patients is increasing. Currently, the number of AD patients is over 40 million, and it is expected to exceed 100 million by 2050 [8]. Studies have shown that postmenopausal older women are at a higher risk of developing AD [15, 16]. This increase in the number of AD patients will create enormous pressure and burden for patients, their families, and society as a whole [15]. Unfortunately, there is no effective therapy for AD, and the pathogenesis of AD needs to be further investigated.\nThe microglia are a group of immune cells that reside in the brain, involved in several biological processes, including the pruning of synapses, the formation of myelin sheaths, and the removal of cellular debris and misfolded proteins, which are crucial for brain development, maintenance of brain physiological function and occurrence and development of various brain diseases [17\u201319]. Although there is increasing evidence that microglia play a role in the pathogenesis of AD, the potential molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In particular, neuroinflammation in AD is receiving increasing attention, and microglia play a role in several aspects of neuroinflammation [20]. Reactive Gliosis (i.e., the microglia response to nerve tissue damage, pathogen infection, or other injuries) has been observed to co-locate closely with A\u03b2 plaques in animal models of AD and postmortem brain tissue of AD patients. This suggests that microglia neuroinflammation may be an early event in AD, and that microglia pro-inflammatory activation is a hallmark of AD [13, 21]. In addition, microglia can undergo a metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to aerobic glycolysis in response to stress stimuli [22, 23]. Importantly, lactic acid, a product derived from aerobic glycolysis, was found to directly promotes the release of microglia proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin (IL-6), and interleukin 1B (IL-1\u03b2) [24], but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Metabolically active senescent\nmicroglia-mediated neuroinflammatory responses (e.g., via SASP) are thought to further threaten senescent neurons, thus driving the progression of age-related neurodegeneration [25], such as AD. However, the effect of senescent microglia on AD and the underlying mechanisms are not well-understood.\nIn eukaryotic cells, protein post-translational modification (PTM) enables rapid functional adaptation to various intracellular and extracellular signals by regulating enzyme activity and protein stability [26]. PTM disorders can lead to a variety of pathological conditions, such as defective sperm development [27], malignant transformation [28\u201330] and depression [31]. With the application of modern mass spectrometry (MS), a series of novel shortchain lysine acylations have been identified, such as lactylation [32], crotonylation [33], \u03b2-hydroxy isobutyrylation [34] and succinylation [35]. Although these novel acylation has a structural parallel with the well-known acetylation, their physical function are distinctive. Histone Lysine lactylation (Kla) is a novel epigenetic modification that can affect gene expression [36]. Interestingly, lactate, which is produced by glycolysis under hypoxic conditions or during the bacterial challenge, stimulating histone lactylation and subsequently activating downstream gene expression [32]. In addition, histone lactylation plays an important role as an epigenetic regulator in pathogenesis. For example, elevated histone Kla at the gene sites of reparative macrophages can promote the transition of macrophages from an inflammatory state to a repair state in response to microbial ligands and various deleterious signals [37]. Glis1-induced histone Kla at the pluripotency gene locus promotes somatic reprogramming [38]. Histone lactylation drives tumorigenesis by regulating different downstream targets or signaling, such as m6A reader protein YTHDF2 in ocular melanoma [30], TGF-\u03b2 in hepatocellular carcinoma [39], and METTL3mediated RNA m6A in tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells [40]. Furthermore, it has been found that nerve excitation can induce the lactic modification of brain proteins and that lysine lactate in brain cells is regulated by systemic changes in lactate levels, nerve excitation and behaviorrelated stimuli [41]. Recently, Wang et\u00a0al. found that histone lactylation can promote reparative gene activation post myocardial infarction [42]. Collectively, these studies indicate that histone Kla is an important molecular mediating the function of lactic acid, and it is involved in various pathophysiologies as mentioned above. However, there are few reports on the study of histone Kla in aging and AD.\nIn this study, we found that elevated lactic acid levels promote H3K18 lactylation in senescent microglia and the hippocampus of naturally aged mice and AD mice. Treatment of senescent microglia with Lactate dehydrogenase inhibitors leads to a dramatic decrease in lactic acid levels, which cause a significant decrease in histone Kla. We identified all histone Kla sites in senescent microglia, and found that H3K18la was significantly upregulated in senescent microglia, and the hippocampus of naturally aged mice and AD mice. We demonstrate that enhanced H3K18la directly stimulates the NF\u03baB signaling to promote SASP, thereby facilitating aging and AD phenotypes."

To evaluate the metabolic reprogramming of microglia from OXPHOS to glycolysis, we measured the lactate levels in doxorubicin(dox)-induced premature senescent microglia (termed as BV2_Dox and HMC3_Dox) (a well-established cellular senescent model) (Additional file\u00a0 1: Fig. S1a\u2013h), proliferating microglia (termed as BV2_NC and HMC3_ NC), as well as in the hippocampus of naturally aged mice (24-month-old mice and older (geriatric age)) (Additional file\u00a0 1: Fig. S1i, j) and AD mice (two well-established AD mice model). The colorimetric assay revealed that lactate levels were significantly elevated in premature microglia (Fig.\u00a0 1A), and the hippocampus tissues of naturally aged mice (Fig.\u00a01B), FAD4T mice and APP/PS1 mice (Fig.\u00a01C). These findings are consistent with the previous reports indicating higher lactate concentrations AD patients compared to healthy wild type (WT). Notably, lactate levels are markedly reduced in dox-induced senescent microglia following treatment with lactate dehydrogenase inhibitor (LDH-IN-1) (Fig.\u00a01A), suggesting that the increased lactate levels in dox-induced senescent microglia originate from glycolysis products.\nHistone Pan\u2011Kla is\u00a0substantially elevated in\u00a0senescent microglia and\u00a0hippocampus tissues of\u00a0naturally aged mice As lactate or Sodium lactate can serve as a precursor metabolite to stimulate histone Kla [32], it prompted us to hypothesize that histone Kla may be altered in the context of aging. Therefore, Sodium lactate was used in this study to enhance lactylation after treatment of BV2 and HMC3 cells [32, 40]. Intriguingly, immunoblotting analysis of acid-extracted histones, cell immunofluorescence and multiple immunohistochemistry (mIHC) showed a significant increase in the levels of Pan-histone Kla in both senescent microglia (Fig.\u00a0 2A\u2013 D) and hippocampus tissues of naturally aged mice (Fig.\u00a0 2E), but not in the cortex tissues of naturally aged mice (Fig.\u00a02F). In addition, mIHC revealed that the Pan Kla level is strikingly increased particularly around the microglia (Fig.\u00a0 2G). Moreover, we found that the nonhistone Pan Kla levels are also dramatically elevated in\nboth senescent microglia, and hippocampus tissues of naturally aged mice, in relation to corresponding counterparts (Additional file\u00a01: Fig. S2a, b), but no significant change was observed in the cortex (Additional file\u00a01: Fig. S2c). Because the degree of increase in non-histone Pan Kla was less pronounced than that of histone Pan Kla. We focused our attention on histone Kla in the subsequent study. Similar to the alteration of lactate levels, elevated pan-histone Kla levels in dox-induced senescent microglia were significantly decreased when treated with lactate dehydrogenase inhibitor in BV2 (Fig.\u00a02H) and HMC3 (Fig.\u00a02I), indicating that the increased histone pan-Kla in senescent microglia indeed comes from elevated lactate concentrations."

[33], and identified several overlapping histone Kla sites (Additional file\u00a01: Fig. S3c). Next, we selected H4K8, H4K12, H3K14 and H3K18 to validate the MS-generated lactylome data. For this purpose, acid-extracted histones from proliferative microglia (BV2_NC, HMC3_NC), dox-induced senescent microglia (BV2_Dox, HMC3_Dox), and NacL or NaLa treated proliferative microglia were immunoprecipitated with corresponding histone pan-and sites-Kla antibody, and histone H3 antibody. The results showed that these histone sites were indeed lactylated in microglia and hippocampus tissues (Fig.\u00a0 5A\u2013C). Among these lactylated histone sites, only H3K18la is elevated in both dox-induced senescent microglia (Fig.\u00a0 5A, B), hippocampus tissues of naturally aged mice (Fig.\u00a0 5C) and AD model mice (Fig.\u00a0 5D, E), which is in line with the previously reported results that H3K18la level is increased in hippocampus of AD mouse model compared to that of WT mice. Intriguingly, H3K18la level is not significantly altered in the cortex of naturally aged mice (Fig.\u00a0 5F) and AD modeling mice (Fig.\u00a05G, H), suggesting that H3K18la may be an important potential target involved in regulating aging and AD by functioning in the hippocampus region. Consequently,\n(See figure on next page.) Fig. 3 Identification of Kla proteome profile in BV2 cells.

            "text": "Histone acylation modifications can both promote and inhibit the transcription of downstream target genes [49]. To explore the downstream target genes regulated by H3K18la and their potential biological functional significance in the process of microglia senescence, brain aging and AD, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (Chip-seq) to identify candidate genes regulated by H3K18la in senescent microglia. Chip-seq using antibodies against H3K18la in senescent BV2 cells (DoxBV2) and young BV2 cells (NC-BV2) revealed obvious enrichment of H3K18la peaks in Dox-BV2 compared to NC-BV2 (Fig.\u00a0 6A). The comparison between Dox-BV2 and NC-BV2 showed 21,774 differential H3K18la binding peaks, with 19.74% of the peaks located within promoter sequences (\u2264 1\u00a0kb), and with 3.77% of the peaks located within promoter sequences (1\u00a0kb\u20132\u00a0kb) (Fig.\u00a06B).\nTo investigate the potential target genes regulated by H3K18la in senescent microglia, a total of 11,796 target gene of different H3K18la binding peaks at the promoter in senescent microglia were classified into different KEGG pathways. These KEGG pathways include the chemokine signaling pathway, cellular senescence, NFkappa B signaling pathway, TNF-signaling pathway and p53 signaling pathway, which are involved in aging and inflammation (Fig.\u00a06C). Specifically, the peaks identified candidate genomic loci at NF\u03baB genes, including NF\u03baB1 (gene ID: 18033, location: chr3: 135397308\u2013135397660) and Rela (gene ID: 19697, location: chr19: 5686901\u2013 5687340), showed that the abundance of H3K18la\n\u25b8\nbinding on the promoters of these genes in Dox-BV2 was significantly elevated compared to NC-BV2 (Fig.\u00a06D).\nChip quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (ChipqPCR) analysis using primer pairs (Additional file\u00a0 2: Table\u00a0 S1) targeting potential promoter-binding regions revealed that the H3K18la levels on promoters of Rela and NF\u03baB1 were significantly elevated in Dox-BV2 compared with Dox-BV2 (Fig.\u00a06E). H3K18la has three binding sites on the ReLa promoter region, and one binding site on the NF\u039aB 1 promoter. To further validate the epigenetic role of H3K18la, we synchronously performed RNA-seq to analyze the transcriptional expression profile of Dox-BV2 and NC-BV2. Consistently, the KEGG analysis from the RNA-seq data set showed the signaling pathway enrichment of NF\u03baB and Cytokine\u2013 cytokine receptor interaction (Additional file\u00a01: Fig. S4). Combined with data from Chip-qPCR and RNA-seq, we conclude that H3K18la directly stimulates the NF\u03baB signaling by enhanced binding on promoter regions of Rela and NF\u03baB1.\nH3K18la/NF\u03baB signaling axis promotes brain aging and\u00a0Alzheimer\u2019s disease phenotype by\u00a0potentiating SASP components IL\u20116 and\u00a0IL\u20118 To investigate the effect of the H3K18la/NF\u03baB signaling axis on the SASP, we treated proliferating BV2 and HMC3 cells with or without Nacl, dox, lactate or NF\u03baB inhibitor JSH-23. First, an immunoblotting assay validated that lactate-treated proliferating BV2 and HMC3 cells led to elevated p\u2013p65 level in relation to cells treated with Nacl, while proliferating BV2 or HMC3 cells simultaneously treated with JSH-23 reverse the increased p\u2013 p65 (Fig.\u00a07A, B). Moreover, cell immunofluorescence also verified that lactate-treated proliferating BV2 and HMC3 cells enhanced the expression of activated p65 in nucleus compared to cells treated with NaCl, while lactate-treated proliferating BV2 and HMC3 cells simultaneously treated with JSH-23 reduced nuclear activation of p65, which is consistent with the results from the immunoblotting assay (Fig.\u00a07C, D). Q-PCR data found that lactate-treated proliferating BV2 and HMC3 cells showed obvious increase in IL-6 and IL-8 levels compared to cells treated with NaCl, suggesting that the elevated SASP components were\ntriggered by lactate-induced H3K18la. In contrast, lactate-treated proliferating BV2 or HMC3 cells simultaneously treated with JSH-23 reversed the H3K18la-induced increases in IL-6 and IL-8, indicating that lactate-induced enhanced H3K18la led to elevated IL-6 and IL-8 through the NF\u03baB signaling in BV2 and HMC3 cells (Fig.\u00a0 7E, F). Taken together, our data substantiate that the H3K18la/ NF\u03baB signaling axis regulates IL-6 and IL-8, which affect brain aging and Alzheimer\u2019s disease phenotype."

            "text": "Compelling evidence suggests that abnormal histone modifications influences the translation of cellular metabolic intermediates into changes in gene transcription and expression [50]. This is mediated by cellular intermediary metabolites which serve as cofactors that either add or remove chromatin modifications, induced by chromatin modifying enzymes. Concentration changes in these cellular metabolic intermediates may up- or down-regulate gene expression by altering chromatin states [51]. A recent study found that Lactate, a product of glycolysis and a significant energy source, can regulates gene transcription via lactylation of histones through fluctuations in lactate content in cells, representing a new PTM contributor to the epigenetic landscape.\nSeveral lines of evidence suggest that senescent cells are still metabolically active, and can induce changes in their environment through secreted molecules or by switching energy metabolism fashion [52, 53]. Senescent cells are associated with a shift towards glycolysis [54]. In this work, we found that lactate levels are significantly increased in senescent microglia, indicating that senescent microglia switch their metabolism from OXPHOS to aerobic glycolysis, which produces 5\u2032-triphosphate (ATP) rapidly but also generates massive lactate. Moreover, senescent microglia-trigged accumulation of lactate caused enhanced histone Kla levels, contributing to the development and progression of brain aging and AD pathogenesis. These preliminary results suggest that the metabolic transition to aerobic glycolysis of senescent microglia may also affect itself and its local environment by affecting neuroinflammation through histone Klamediated epigenetics. In the epigenetic mechanism, our\n(See figure on next page.) Fig. 6 Analysis of the transcriptional consequences of H3K18la in Senescent BV2 Cells.

Our data expand the biological function of histone Kla and histone Kla-regulated downstream target gene or signaling pathway. Our results preliminarily uncover that the H3K18 lactylation/NF\u03baB signaling axis in senescent microglia can aggravate brain aging and AD phenotype by potentiating SASP, which is partly in agreement with a previous study reporting an H4K12 lactylation/PKM2 positive feedback loop in microglia that drives the pathogenesis of AD [24,\u00a0 25]. Taken together, the above results suggest that different histone lactylations act through different molecular mechanics by modulating distinct target genes or pathways in microglia to influence brain aging and AD phenotype. Several lines of evidence have shown that H3K27 acetylation, H4K16 acetylation, H3K9 acetylation, H3K4 methylation, H3K79 methylation, and H3K9 are implicated in the epigenetic regulation of the SASP in a PTM manner. Thus, our study found that H3K18 lactylation epigenetically regulates the SASP through NF\u03baB signaling, broadening the list of epigenetic regulatory members of the SASP in a novel PTM aspect.\nPan.et al. found that H4K12la and H3K18la were elevated in the hippocampus and cortex tissues of AD modeling mice. Enhanced H4K12la aggravated the cognitive impairment phenotype through the glycolysis/H4K12la/ PKM2 signaling axis [24]. In contrast, we uncovered that H3K18la is significantly increased in the hippocampus tissues of naturally aged and AD mice, but remained unchanged in the cortex tissues of naturally aged and AD modeling mice. This indicates that H4K12la and H3K18la are expressed in different localizations, have distinct\nbiological functions, and downstream targets during the pathogenesis of AD. H4K12LA promotes AD pathology by regulating key glycolytic enzyme genes (such as PKM2), while H3K18la promotes AD pathology by regulating inflammation-related signaling pathways (such as NF\u03baB).\nIn the present study, we confirm that the elevated lactate levels extensively exist in senescent microglial, and hippocampus tissues of naturally aged mice and AD mice, driving pan-lactylation and histone lactylation by histone lysine lactylases. Furthermore, we present the landscape of lactylome in BV2 cells by MS, and validate that H3K18la is substantially elevated in hippocampus tissues of naturally aged mice and AD mice among the MS-generated histone lactylation sites. Mechanically, we found that enhanced H3K18la leads to enhanced binding on the promoter region of Rela and Nf\u03baB1, thereby potentiating NF\u03baB signaling and ultimately promoting SASP components IL-6 and IL-8, which dramatically impact brain aging and AD pathology. Our study suggests that there is an H3K18la/ NF\u03baB axis/SASP positive feedback loop driving the pathogenesis of brain aging and AD. Furthermore, we also found that the acetyltransferase p300/CBP and PCAF is the histone lactylases (also termed \u201cwriter\u201d) both in 293T, Hela, BV2 and HMC3 C cells (Additional file\u00a01: Fig. S5), which is partly in line with previous study by Zhang et\u00a0al. [32] and Moreno-Yruela et\u00a0al. who identified class I histone deacetylases (HDAC1-3) as histone lysine delactylases (also termed \u201ceraser\u201d) [55].\nCollectively, these findings showed a novel molecular mechanism in which H3K18la/NF\u03baB axis modulates inflammation associated with aging (infammageing) by regulating SASP components IL-6 and IL-8, promoting brain aging and AD pathological phenotypes (Fig.\u00a08).These results present potential targets for the development of drug interventions for brain aging and AD pathology.\nFig. 7 H3K18la/NF\u03baB signaling axis aggravate brain aging and Alzheimer\u2019s disease pathology by upregulating IL-6 and IL-8.
