 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after reading the paper on Vertical Federated Learning and bargaining-based feature trading:

1. Design more advanced and efficient bargaining strategies for the task party and data party. The current sampling-evaluation approach for generating quoted prices and feature bundle offers is basic. More sophisticated strategies like reinforcement learning agents could be explored.

2. Investigate multi-party bargaining mechanisms. The paper focuses on 1-to-1 bargaining between a single task party and data party. Extending the model to allow multi-party bargaining could make it more practical.

3. Incorporate stronger privacy protections into the bargaining process. The paper mentions using encryption for the performance gain exchange, but more rigorous differential privacy or secure multi-party computation techniques could help prevent inference attacks.

4. Study the dynamics and equilibria in a competitive VFL marketplace with multiple buyers and sellers. The bargaining model is for two parties, but analyzing a complex marketplace with many participants could provide economic insights.

5. Implement and test the bargaining approach in real-world VFL systems and applications. Conducting experiments beyond simulations using industry datasets would help validate the practical utility of the bargaining model.
