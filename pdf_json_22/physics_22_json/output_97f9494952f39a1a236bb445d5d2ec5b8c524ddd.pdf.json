INTRODUCTION\nFor a fluid saturated porous volume with an elastic frame and tubular pores, the Biot (1956b) model predicts that the fast compressional wave and shear wave undergo an attenuation\nthat is proportional to f 2 at low frequencies and ffiffi f p attenuation at higher frequencies considering turbulent flow at those frequencies. The classification into low and high frequency regimes is based on the volume of the fluid that is subjected to motion (or the boundary layer thickness of the viscous fluid) at the frequency of excitation (Fellah et al., 2002). A prospective weakness in the original Biot and Extended Biot frameworks is that they have not previously been associated with equivalent partial differential wave equations, i.e., a time domain representation satisfying a passivity criterion. This might indicate that the physical bases for the models are incomplete (Buckingham, 2014). In the time domain, the medium response of a passive system can be described by an impulse response. For a dispersive medium, the frequency domain relaxation response transforms into a time domain convolution operator known as the material memory function. This accounts for the temporal nonlocal response (Fellah et al., 2002), and it is a weighting function that defines how the past affects the present state of the system.\nThe Biot poroelastic medium per definition is homogeneous at the mesoscopic scale, i.e., between the macroscopic\nwavelength scale and the microscopic grain scale. The dispersion and attenuation in porous media with heterogeneity, complex geometry, or gradients in porosity vary significantly from the predictions of the Biot model. To solve the laws of poroelasticity in such complex media, proper representation of the wave equations and optimal numerical methods are required (Masson et al., 2006). Numerical wave propagation in complex and frequencydependent media is an essential tool in a wide range of industry and research domains. A key aspect lies in incorporating measurement based material properties into a propagation and medium modelling while still maintaining a framework that adheres to the first principles of physics. Moreover, it is paramount that the applied methods appropriately represent the frequency-dependent parameters of the dispersion relation, in particular, within the frequency bands of the propagating wave packets.\nFor example, in geophysical applications, full-waveform propagation codes are typically based on finite differences, operator splitting, spectral evolution, or finite element approaches (Carcione, 2015). For these codes, the evolution of the wavefield is either performed in the frequency domain, temporal domain, or in a hybrid domain, depending on the properties of the numerical propagation problem to solve and the trade-off between computational burden and accuracy requirements. We note that there are several time domain wave equation flavors\u2014in particular, those where the material properties feature a frequency power-law\u2014that incorpo-\nrate terms of non-integer (fractional) partial derivative ordera)Electronic mail: srinc@ifi.uio.no\n2576 J.

Several efficient numerical recipes have been developed to evaluate the fractional derivative (e.g., Diethelm, 2010, 2021; Diethelm et al., 2020; Owolabi and Atangana, 2019). Hence, there might be potential in adapting the specialized fractional derivative based numerical methods to efficiently solve wave propagation problems that involve a time domain partial differential equation representation that features non-integer derivative terms. We also point out that the well-established k-wave family of specialized pseudospectral codes for ultrasonic wavefield simulation in power-law heterogeneous biological tissue relies on a fractional derivative based modelling (Treeby and Cox, 2010), where non-linear wave propagation can be also taken into account (Treeby et al., 2020).\nThe time domain representation of propagation of a transient wave with finite duration, i.e., a signal of great frequency bandwidth, in terms of the solution of a direct or inverse problem is important in applications of medical imaging such as bone ultrasound or inverse scattering (Fellah et al., 2002; Fellah et al., 2013b). The time domain representation has previously been found for the Biot model, where the flow is laminar, i.e., in the low frequency regime (Holm, 2019, Chap. 8.3). For the asymptotic high frequency regime where the flow is turbulent, the time domain equivalent of\nthe ffiffi f p attenuation is described by half-order fractional derivatives (Holm, 2019, Chap. 8.4). In the current work, we develop single-mode equivalent time domain partial differential equations for the shear and compressional wave modes for the Biot poroelastic model with turbulence valid for the low and high frequencies. Here, single mode refers to matching the relaxation mechanisms of each wave mode of a Biot poroelastic medium with fully saturated fluid through viscoelastic equivalents. The single-mode equivalent time domain representation, covering the full frequency range, accounts for the development of viscous boundary layers and thereby the transition frequency (Masson and Pride, 2010) when compared to the asymptotic time domain representation of Holm (2019). These time domain models are built on the Biot dispersion relations in combination with a set of reasonable approximations to the Bessel relaxation response function based viscodynamic correction operator.\nOur work uses a form of time domain representation, a shifted time fractional derivative, akin to the one provided for the viscodynamic correction operator in Blanc et al. [2013, Eq. (8)]. Blanc et al. (2013) developed a time domain finite-difference based numerical approach for wave propagation in Biot-Johnson-Koplik-Dashen (JKD) media. In this article, using a weak frame approximation (Geertsma and Smit, 1961), we develop explicit wave equations for all three wave modes.\nThis article is organized as follows: In Sec. II, a simple approximation for the viscodynamic correction operator and its time domain representation is discussed. In Sec. III, the wave equations for all three wave modes of the Biot model with the required approximations and correction factors are obtained. They are validated by comparing with the existing\nlow and high frequency asymptotic wave equations. Additionally, the relaxation mechanisms for the squirt flow are incorporated. In Sec. IV, there is a discussion on optimal numerical solution aspects."

            "text": "We first review the relaxation response of a poroelastic medium, including the viscodynamic operator for turbulence in the pores. It is a frequency domain expression described by Bessel functions that does not lend itself easily to inverse Fourier transformation. The viscodynamic operator has, however, a simple and often used approximation. The advantage of the approximation is that its inverse Fourier transform is possible to find. This is essential to move from the commonly used dispersion relations in the frequency to a time domain representation of the Biot theory in the form of wave equations.\nA. Viscodynamic correction operator\nBiot developed a framework where poroelastic media can be modelled as a porous volume with a skeletal frame and tubular pores that are permeated by a fluid (Biot, 1956a,b). The average force balance on the porous volume and permeated fluid is obtained through a combination of stress-strain constitutive equations and Lagrange\u2019s momentum equations. Lagrange\u2019s momentum equation for a permeated fluid incorporates dissipation from the relative flow between the solid and the fluid. The coefficient of dissipation has permeability as a main parameter and is obtained from Darcy\u2019s law (van Dalen, 2013).\nThe Darcy law formulation is valid as long as the flow is laminar and the viscous skin depth is greater than the characteristic pore size. Under such circumstances, static and frequency-independent permeability accounts for the viscous dissipation effects. On the other hand, at higher frequencies, the viscous effects are confined to a thin boundary layer in the vicinity of the pore walls. Then, the inertial drag dominates, which leads to a turbulent fluid flow (Johnson et al., 1987). At these frequencies, the static permeability alone cannot account for the inertial effects. To account for the breakdown in the assumption that the viscous skin depth is greater than the characteristic pore size after the Biot characteristic frequency, Biot derived the viscodynamic correction operator for a two-dimensional (2D) duct with parallel planes and a three-dimensional (3D) circular duct in terms of the Kelvin functions from the solution of the oscillatory viscous flow problem in pore space in the frequency domain (Biot, 1956b). The latter is equivalent to the Bessel function expression derived by Zwikker and Kosten (1949, Chap. 2) for acoustic wave propagation in a cylindrical tube without considering the thermal conductivity. For a 3D circular pore geometry, the aforementioned viscodynamic correction operator is\nF\u00f0x\u00de \u00bc 1 4 z2J1\u00f0iz\u00de izJ0\u00f0iz\u00de 2J1\u00f0iz\u00de \u00bc iz 4 J1\u00f0iz\u00de J2\u00f0iz\u00de ; (1)\nJ. Acoust. Soc. Am. 151 (4), April 2022 Chandrasekaran et al. 2577\n19 January 2024 01:09:38\nwhere iz \u00bc i ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ixsr p\n; sr \u00bc qf R2=g is the characteristic relaxation time, R is the radius of the circular pore, qf is the fluid density, and g is the viscosity of the fluid. J0;1;2 are Bessel functions of the first kind. The product, xsr, decides the flow regime, i.e., when xsr 1, the flow is laminar and for x! 0; F\u00f0x\u00de ! 1. For xsr 1, the flow is in a turbulent regime.\nAs was pointed out in Biot (1956b), the viscodynamic correction operators for the 2D and 3D geometries are for high frequencies asymptotically proportional to the square root of the frequency. Because the exact shape of the pores is generally not known for real media, there is some uncertainty regarding the exact details of the viscodynamic correction operator. At least, it is important to retain the limiting value for x! 0 and high frequency asymptotic characteristics. A simplified expression for the viscodynamic correction operator is (Holm, 2019, Chap. 7.6.4; Johnson et al., 1987; Blanc et al., 2013)\nF\u00f0x\u00de \u00bc ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 1\u00fe ixsrcp p ; (2)\nwhere cp is the pore shape factor, and this ensures the high and low frequency asymptotes to match between the models. The pore shape factor varies with the geometry of the pore. The value of cp is 1/16 for a simplified [i.e., square root expression of Eq. (2)] 3D circular pore [see Holm, 2019, Eq. (7.95)], whereas the pore shape factor is 1/9 for a simplified 2D duct. Figure 1 shows a comparison between the square root expression of Eq. (2) and that for the circular pore of Eq. (1) with cp \u00bc 1=16. The pore shape factor, cp \u00bc 1=16, will be used in the rest of the article. In Fig. 1, the deviations seem significant as the 3D circular pore viscodynamic operator and its square root approximation are plotted only for a decade of frequency as in Biot (1956b, Fig. 4). When plotted over six decades of frequency, the deviations appear quite small.\nAn alternative but equivalent point of view comes from considering the dynamic permeability. This is defined as the static permeability factor, B0, divided by the viscodynamic operator, F\u00f0x\u00de. In that context, a square root expression for the viscodynamic operator similar to Eq. (2) was proposed\nin Johnson et al. [1987, Eq. (3.3)] as \u201cthe simplest possible model\u201d and discussed as an alternative to the exact expression for the circular pores of Eq. (1). Apart from the square root expression, Turgut (2000) proposed a truncated power series expansion for the viscodynamic correction operator, which matches the relaxation peak frequency in the attenuation per cycle, Q 1. A comparison between the normalized magnitude and phase of dynamic permeability, i.e., the inverse of the viscodynamic correction operator, 1=F\u00f0x\u00de, for the two cases is shown in Fig. 2. There is some difference in the mid-range frequencies but given the uncertainty in the exact pore shape of the medium and, therefore, in the pore shape factor, cp, this difference is considered insignificant. The advantage of the square root approximation for the purpose of this article is that it has a time domain representation given by its inverse Fourier transform. It should also be remarked that the dynamic permeability or the inverse of the viscodynamic operator in Eq. (2) is functionally the equivalent of the Cole-Davidson dielectric model of order 0.5 (Davidson and Cole, 1950)."

(6), resembles the differentiation property of the Fourier transform, which says that nth order differentiation of a function results in a Fourier transform that is \u00f0ix\u00den times the Fourier transform of the original function. This property is often generalized to non-integer powers; therefore, Eq. (6) is equivalent to differentiation of order b or integration of a non-integer order b. This gives rise to an arbitrary noninteger (or fractional) order derivative interpretation tightly linked to convolution with a power-law kernel.\nTherefore, Eq. (3) in combination with Eq.

Whether the input output relationship is described by the implicit convolution integral of Eq. (5) or the fractional derivative description of Eq. (7) may be a matter of taste. But the latter often renders a more compact description, and when it comes to the complex kernels to be considered next, it simplifies the notation considerably. However, it is worth emphasizing that the fractional derivative in any of the subsequent derivations may be replaced with the equivalent convolution integral,\nDct x\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc 1\nC\u00f0m c\u00de \u00f0t 1 x\u00f0m\u00de\u00f0s\u00de \u00f0t s\u00dec\u00fe1 m ds; (8)\nwhere x\u00f0m\u00de denotes an integer order derivative, m is the smallest integer larger than the order c for positive c, and m\u00bc 0 otherwise. In Eqs. (3)\u2013(7), c \u00bc b and m\u00bc 0. This is the Caputo definition of the fractional derivative.\nIn Eq.

(10), one has to go through the steps:\n(1) Shift F(s) by X0, then recognize the multiplication by sb. The result is that F\u00f0s X0\u00deX\u00f0s\u00de is equivalent to D b t \u00f0eX0tx\u00f0t\u00de\u00de in the time domain; and (2) a second shift by X0 back to \u00f0s\u00fe X0\u00debX\u00f0s\u00de gives an additional exponential factor.

However, at any point in the derivations that follow, the operator of Eq. (14) may be substituted with a convolution integral by means of Eqs. (13) and (8). Our derivation of the fractional pseudodifferential operator confirms the findings of Blanc et al. [2013, Eq. (8)], where an expression of a similar form was shown. To make the results of the article more accessible, the framework of the fractional pseudo-differential operator has been derived in detail when compared to the previously published articles (Blanc et al., 2013; Garrappa et al., 2016; Nigmatullin and Ryabov, 1997). In our work, we then derive the corresponding time-space wave equations."

Improved approximation for the compressional modes\nPhysically, b=2a 1 refers to a porous medium with a solid bulk modulus that is at least a few orders of magnitude greater than the skeletal frame bulk modulus, i.e., when the Biot poroelastic constant, ak, is very close to one,\nak \u00bc 1 Kr Ks ; (23)\nwhere Kr and Ks are the bulk moduli of the frame and solid, respectively. The compressional mode approximation of fast and slow waves works well for a porous medium in that poroelastic constant regime. For some cases, this approximation is not accurate enough in the high frequency regime (Chandrasekaran and Holm, 2019a,b).\nTo overcome this discrepancy, we introduce the correction factors, Cf and Cs, for the compressional wave modes in the generalization of the material response function of Eq. (15) as follows:\nr\u00f0x\u00de e\u00f0x\u00de \u00bc q x2 k2 \u00bc G\nK1 \u00fe ixCf ke\nxcF\u00f0x\u00de\n1\u00fe ix 1 Cs kr xcF\u00f0x\u00de\n2 6664\n3 7775; (24)\nxc \u00bc g\nqB0 : (25)\nThe correction factors, Cf and Cs, are different from the pore shape factor, cp, and these are not required for the shear wave mode, i.e., Cf and Cs for the shear mode are both equal to one. The generalized material response function applies to the compressional mode and shear mode using the mode specific parameters of Table I.\nThe correction factor, Cf, is applied as a scaling factor to the relaxation time constant of the material response function, i.e., se \u00bc ke=xcF\u00f0x\u00de. Similarly, the second correction factor, Cs, is applied as an inverse scaling factor to the retardation time constant of the material response function, i.e., sr \u00bc kr=xcF\u00f0x\u00de.\nThe objective is to find the correction factors that ensure that the high frequency asymptotes for the phase velocity are the same as those for the approximation and exact model. The material response function in Eq. (15) has an asymptotic phase velocity [Holm, 2019, Eq. (2.74) and p. 144], of\nc2z;1 \u00bc G q ke kr : (26)\nThe exact Biot theory has a compressional wave asymptotic phase velocity, c1, which can be obtained from Eq. (1) in Badiey et al.

It can be shown that the correction factors for the fast and slow modes are inverses of each other, i.e., Cf Cs \u00bc 1. Comparisons between the exact solution using Eqs. (1) and (20) and the corresponding compressional mode\u2019s uncorrected [Eq. (22)] and corrected approximations [Eq. (24)] with square root expression for the viscodynamic correction operator [Eq. (2)] are shown in Figs. 3\u20135. Figure 3 shows the fast compressional wave velocity and attenuation for water saturated sand while Fig. 4 shows the fast compressional wave velocity and attenuation for air saturated sand. Both examples are from Hovem (2012, Table 16.2). Figure 5 shows the fast compressional wave velocity and attenuation for cancellous bone. Cancellous bone is a matrix of solid trabeculae with soft bone marrow filled in. The parameters for cancellous bone are from Fellah et al. (2013a). All of the parameters of the examples are given in Table II.\nFor the water and air saturated sediment examples, there is hardly any difference between the exact Biot theory and the corrected approximations, neither for the fast compressional wave velocity nor for the fast compressional wave attenuation. In these cases, ak \u00bc 0:9842, which is quite close to unity. The cancellous bone example has a lower value for the Biot poroelastic constant, ak \u00bc 0:6270, and the assumption, b=2a 1, is not so well satisfied anymore. Therefore, for the fast compressional wave velocity, there\nTABLE I.

It is different for the fast compressional wave attenuation, where there is now only a reasonable match at all of the frequencies between the corrected approximation and its exact counterpart.\nThe dynamic modulus, E\u00f0x\u00de \u00bc r\u00f0x\u00de=e\u00f0x\u00de, as found from Eq. (24) can be shown to be a complete Bernstein function. Likewise, the square root approximation expression for the viscodynamic correction operator of Eq. (2) is a complete monotonic function. It can also be shown that the phase velocity of all three wave modes is a nondecreasing function of the frequency and the attenuation increases asymptotically with the square root of the frequency, i.e., it has sublinear growth. Therefore, the model satisfies the passivity criterion (Holm and Holm, 2017).\nNow, assuming a case in which the corrected approximations work well, we can apply the corrections of Eq. (29).

            "text": "In a Biot poroelastic medium, the fluid pressure gradient from the compressional wave propagation (global flow) in the pore space does not always account for the compressional wave attenuation predicted experimentally in marine sediments. The grain contact (broken/incomplete) is more compliant than the pore space, and the compressional wave propagation leads to a fluid flow from the incomplete grain contact to the pore space (Pride, 2005). This is referred to as the squirt flow mechanism, and one may model the incomplete grain-grain contact permeated by the fluid as a thin circular tube connected to a finite annular pore (Kimura, 2006). In their Extended Biot model, Chotiros and Isakson (2014) incorporated the squirt flow mechanism through two additional relaxation modes, namely, the bulk and shear relaxation modes (Chandrasekaran and Holm, 2019b).\nThe bulk relaxation mode is defined in the complex modulus in terms of the Bessel relaxation response function, whereas the shear relaxation mode is defined in terms of a Kelvin-Voigt spring-damper model.

But for the high frequency asymptotic wave equation or the full frequency range wave equation involving fractional order derivatives, numerical modelling is much more complicated. Masson and Pride (2010) proposed a 2D finite-difference method to solve the Biot poroelastic wave equations across the whole frequency range. There, the convolution time kernel for dynamic permeability was discretized with a finite number of memory terms. Picotti and Carcione (2017) modelled the porous medium through the partial differential equation of a Cole-Cole model involving fractional order loss terms. They also proposed a numerical algorithm based on the Gr\u20acunwaldLetnikov fractional derivative and staggered Fourier pseudo-spectral methods to approximate the temporal and spatial fractional derivatives in the wave equation.\nThe generalized wave equation, as in Eq. (30), involves the half-order (time) fractional pseudo-differential operator, which is equivalent to a time convolution kernel of powerlaw type. The fractional pseudo-differential operator is obtained from the inversion of the Cole-Davidson response function for the viscodynamic correction operator. Blanc et al. (2013) proposed a diffusive representation for the fractional pseudo-differential operator for solving the partial differential wave equation, as in Eq. (30), numerically. The diffusive representation transforms the nonlocal time convolution kernel to a continuum of finite local memory variables that satisfies the in-time ordinary differential equation. The diffusive representation of the convolution kernel offers a numerically tractable formulation over discretization. The aforementioned methods highlight the possibility of solving the wave equations proposed in this article for all three waves numerically. Comparing the numerical solution of the time domain representation in Eq. (30) with the Biot poroelastic model\u2019s frequency domain solution is an area of future work."
