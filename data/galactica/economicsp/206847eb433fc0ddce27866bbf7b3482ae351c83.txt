In this study, we investigate the capacity of large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-3.5, to operationalise natural language descriptions of cooperative, competitive, altruistic, and selfinterested behavior in social dilemmas. Our focus is on the iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma, a classic example of a non-zero-sum interaction, but our broader research program encompasses a range of experimental economics scenarios, including the ultimatum game, dictator game, and public goods game. Using a within-subject experimental design, we instantiated LLM-generated agents with various prompts that conveyed different cooperative and competitive stances. We then assessed the agents’ level of cooperation in the iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma, taking into account their responsiveness to the cooperative or defection actions of their partners. Our results provide evidence that LLMs can translate natural language descriptions of altruism and selfishness into appropriate behaviour to some extent, but exhibit limitations in adapting their behavior based on conditioned reciprocity. The observed pattern of increased cooperation with defectors and decreased cooperation with cooperators highlights potential constraints in the LLM’s ability to generalize its knowledge about human behavior in social dilemmas. We call upon the research community to further explore the factors contributing to the emergent behavior of LLM-generated agents in a wider array of social dilemmas, examining the impact of model architecture, training parameters, and various partner strategies on agent behavior. As more advanced LLMs like GPT-4 become available, it is crucial to investigate whether they exhibit similar limitations or are capable of more nuanced cooperative behaviors, ultimately fostering the development of AI systems that better align with human values and social norms. 1 Motivation and background The concept of agency and goal-directed behavior in large language models (LLMs) has been a topic of ongoing debate and investigation within the AI alignment community. While there are a diverse set of opinions on the subject, a challenge for researchers is that the internal processing of large language models is largely opaque, and in the case of recent models such as GPT-4 the training procedures themselves are also subject to a degree of secrecy. Therefore, objective assessment of the capabilities of large-language models cannot be conducted through inductive reasoning starting from first principles, but instead is a matter of empirical investigation, with experiments being the ultimate arbiter of what they can or can’t do, e.g. [Goo23]. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely studied as a method for training AI agents to learn goal-directed behavior. Though LLMs like GPT-3 are not directly trained using RL to adapt their responses in an online manner, recent studies suggest that they might acquire RL-like mechanisms through zero-shot learning, allowing them to perform downstream tasks such as solving n-armed bandit problems [BS23].  2 methods Our goal was to simulate the results of a real-life Prisoner’s Dilemma (PD) game. Our results were wholly generated through automated conversations between a simulated “investigator” and Chat-GPT (a sample transcript is shown in Appendix B, Section 5.2. The investigator was an automated script written in Python which managed the experiment. As shown, each “participant” (simulacrum) was created through a series of prompts that were intended to predispose the chatbot towards a particular orientation towards the PD game (cooperative, competitive, altruistic, mixed, control). Hence, a “participant” existed solely during the course of a single conversation (then, a new “participant” was generated by closing the previous conversation and starting a new one). As shown, each conversation began with the investigator providing the orientation-specific prompt (in appendix B, the control version is shown). This is followed by an conclusion and future work Our results demonstrate that GPT 3.5 is able, at least to some extent, to operationalise concepts of altruism and selfishness in the iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma. However, most of the simulacra failed to adapt their strategy appropriately in the face of differing levels of cooperation or defection from partners. 5 appendices  5.1 appendix a: detailed description of prompts This appendix provides a comprehensive list of prompts used to instantiate LLM-generated simulacra with varying degrees of cooperation, competitiveness, and other traits. types and characteristics, allowing for a thorough investigation of the impact of prompt features on the emergent goal-like behavior and cooperation propensity of the simulacra. These prompts were used to generate a diverse range of LLM-generated simulacra, enabling the investigation of various cooperation and competition dynamics in the experimental economics simulations. By exploring the interactions and outcomes that arise from these different personas, our research aims to uncover the factors that influence the emergent goal-like behavior and cooperation propensity of large language models, with implications for AI alignment and the design of AI systems that better align with human values and societal goals. The initial prompts are of the form “You are [X]. [Y]” where [X] is used to instantiate a simulacra (see below), and [Y] is a description of the task. For example, [X] might be “You are a helpful and cooperative individual who values teamwork and always seeks the best outcome for all parties involved.”
For the prisoner’s dilemma experiments [Y] is:
This is a study of investment choices in different situations. You will be making your choices with an investment partner who is another person. She is in the next room waiting. In a minute I will take you there yo meet your investment partner. You and your partner will be choosing between two investment projects and you will do so for a total of 6 rounds, where in each round both you and your partner will choose a project. The object is to earn as much money as possible. If you and your partner choose ‘project green’ you will both earn $5.00. If you choose ‘project blue’ but your partner chooses ‘project green’ then you will receive $7.00 and your partner will receive $0.00. If you both choose ‘project blue’ you will each receive $3.00. If your partner chooses ‘project blue’ and you choose ‘project green’ then you will receive $0.00 and your partner will receive $7.00. I will tell you what your partner chooses in subsequent prompts, but you will make your choice ahead of your partner telling me your choice. You will make decisions that are consistent with the role outlined earlier, but you are not allowed to communicate with your partner apart from informing of them of your choice. The[X] part of the prompt used to instantiate the simulacra is taken from the list below, where the participants are grouped into cooperative, competitive, altruistic, selfish, mixed-motivation and control. 5.1.1 participants Competitive Simulacra:
