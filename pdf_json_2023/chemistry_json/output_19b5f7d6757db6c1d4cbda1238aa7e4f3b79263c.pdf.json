            "text": "Breast cancer is the most common cancer worldwide, with more than 2.26 million new cases in women in 2020.1 Triplenegative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for about 10\u201315% of all breast cancers.2 It is aggressive and has a poor prognosis. Compared to other breast cancer subtypes, TNBC is more resistant and more likely to recur after treatment.3 Hence, there is an urgent need for the development of novel chemotherapeutics against TNBC.\nThe p53 protein is a tumour suppressor that is activated by several cellular stressors, including DNA-damaging agents and hypoxia. Breast cancers with mutated p53 have poor prognosis.4 For those reasons, p53 is considered a highly\nrelevant antitumor therapeutic target in anticancer treatment. Two main approaches have been developed to activate p53: 1) in cancers with wild-type (wt) p53, inhibition of the two main p53 negative regulators (MDM2 and MDMX); 2) in cancers with mutated p53, restoration of wt tumour suppressor function of mutant p53.5,6 Recently, spiropyrazoline oxindoles (Fig. 1), like compound 1 (Fig. 2) were identified as dual p53-MDM2/X protein\u2013protein interaction inhibitors with inhibitory activity in the nM range, representing valuable leads for the development of more effective p53 activators.7\nThe ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) is a replication stress-response kinase that also plays a central role in DNA damage response. This kinase is considered a \u2018hot-topic\u2019 selective antitumor target, and several promising clinical studies are currently ongoing to obtain the first ATR\n1778 | RSC Med.

Specifically, we prepared hybrid compounds of protoflavone and spiropyrazoline oxindole derivatives as a multitarget approach and evaluated their antiproliferative activity in breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231."

Linker c was prepared by mesylation\nof azido-PEG3-alcohol (Scheme 2). The reaction of spiropyrazoline oxindole 1 with the three linkers led to compounds 3a\u2013c in good yields containing an azide handle for further modification (Scheme 3).\nProtoflavonoids 2 and 4 were prepared from apigenin, following a previously reported procedure.13 Protoapigenone 1\u2032-O-butyl ether 2 was then functionalized using methyl iodide and propargyl bromide to obtain 7-O-alkyl derivatives 6 and 7, respectively. The 1\u2032-methoxy derivative 4 and the 7-methoxy derivative 6 were prepared and used as reference fragments for the hybrids coupled at positions C-1\u2032 and C-7, respectively (Scheme 4). The choice of these compounds as controls, instead of our original lead PA, is based on their i) improved chemical stability, and ii) retained effect on ATRdependent signaling. These make them more relevant reference compounds than the non-substituted PA for a comparative evaluation of antitumor activity of the designed hybrids.\nHybrids 9\u201313 were prepared from spirooxindoles 3a\u2013c with protoflavone derivatives 5 or 7 via copper(I) catalyzed azide\u2013 alkyne cycloaddition reaction. Reference compounds 8a\u2013c were also synthesised to evaluate the effect of the N\u2032substitution of the oxindole moiety as well as the effect of the size and nature of the linker.

Chem., 2023, 14, 1778\u20131786 This journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023\nAs the most important finding, hybrids 11\u201313, coupled at the C-1\u2032 of the protoflavone fragment, exerted potent cytotoxic activity at low micromolar concentrations against both breast cancer cell lines, and two-times or higher selectivity towards the TNBC cells. This greatly exceeds the potency of all control fragments (1, 4, and 6) as well as that of their linker-containing derivatives (8a\u2013c). On the other hand, hybrids 9 and 10, coupled at the C-7 of the protoflavone, were in general much less active. Still, it may be of interest that compound 9 showed the highest selectivity towards MDA-MB-231 cells among the tested compounds, despite its relatively moderate activity.\nThe control compounds containing spiropyrazoline oxindole 1, linker and triazole either retained (8a and 8c) or lost (8b) the antiproliferative activity in MCF-7 cells compared with compounds 1, 4, and 6. However, in MDA-MB-231 cells, control 8a showed increased potency compared to spiropyrazoline oxindole 1, while the antiproliferative effect of other reference compounds was lost.\nThe antiproliferative effects of the active compounds containing the triazole linker were also tested against the non-cancerous MCF 10A mammary epithelial cell line. The results are shown in Table 2. Comparing the IC50 values of the hybrids in the normal vs. the MDA-MB-231 cell line, compounds 11\u201313 all have quite good tumour selectivity and 13 is the best with a value of ca. 5.5. Concerning the normal vs. MCF-7 cell line selectivity, compound 13 is clearly the best again, exerting about two times stronger activity on the tumour cells.\nTo further elaborate on the relative efficacy of hybrids 11\u201313 compared to that of their fragments, additional calculations were performed based on the same raw cell viability data as a mathematical approach. This was performed by calculating for each hybrid compound a theoretical interaction between its corresponding fragments. A virtual combination index (VCI) was used similar to our previous work on protoflavone\u2013chalchone hybrids.14 Briefly, relevant fragments' cell viability data were taken as control datasets, and the hybrid was considered as a 1 : 1 mixture of its fragments. Then, the Chou method was used to calculate combination index. Considering that the bioactivity of covalently linked hybrids was evaluated this way and not a mixture of separate compounds, the results were expressed as VCI values and are shown in Table 3.\nVCI values for hybrid compounds 11 and 13 showed much stronger synergism against the TNBC MDA-MB-231 cell line than against MCF-7 cells. This shows that coupling their fragments into hybrid molecules increased the anti-TNBC selectivity compared to their both respective fragments. This was not observed for compound 12, even though this compound also has approximately two-fold TNBC MDA-MD-231 cell line selectivity (see Table 2). This suggests that coupling the fragments into hybrid molecules similarly increased efficacy against both cell lines, i.e., a relevant selectivity increase compared to that of the fragments did not occur in the case of compound 12.\nCompound 13 was selected to study its effect on the doxorubicin induced DNA-damage response in MCF-7 cell line. The serine\u2013threonine checkpoint kinases Chk1 and Chk2 have an important role in the DNA damage response, being activated by ATR and ataxia telangiectasia mutated kinase (ATM), respectively. Compound 13 exerted a significant inhibition of the ATR-mediated phosphorylation of Chk1, while it increased the phosphorylation of Chk2 (Fig. 3). The Chk1 inhibitory property suggests that this hybrid can potentially target specific cancer cells with high levels of\nScheme 4 Synthesis of protoflavone propargyl derivatives 2 and 4\u20137.

The NMR measurements were recorded on a Bruker Avance NEO 500 MHz spectrometer equipped with a Prodigy BBO 5 mm CryoProbe or on a Bruker 300 Ultra-Shield (300 MHz) spectrometer.\nMelting points were measured using an RK Tech melting point apparatus with microscope (compounds 7, 9 and 10) or a Kofler camera Bock monoscope M (compounds 8a\u20138c and 11\u201313).\nSynthesis of protoflavone derivatives (2, 4\u20137) from apigenin\n1\u2032-O-Protoflavones 2, 4, 5 were synthesised based on our previously reported method.13 Briefly, apigenin (3.7 mmol, 1 equiv.) was dissolved in 100 mL of a 9 : 1 ratio mixture of acetonitrile and methanol, n-butanol, or propargyl alcohol as appropriate for the targeted ether group, and [bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodo]benzene (PIFA) (7.4 mmol, 2 equiv.) was added. After an hour stirring at 80 \u00b0C, the solvent was evaporated, and the reaction mixture was purified by flash chromatography. For the purification of compounds 2 and 5, an isocratic mixture of n-hexane : ethyl acetate : acetone (80 : 15 : 5) was used as eluent. Compound 4 was purified using a gradient of n-hexane (A) and ethyl acetate (B), going from 15% to 25% B in an hour.\nThe protoflavone 7-O-ethers 6 and 7 were synthesised from protoapigenone 1\u2032-O-butyl ether 2. The starting material (0.28 mmol, 1.0 equiv.) was dissolved in dry DMF (3.57 mL mmol\u22121 3), followed by addition of potassium carbonate (0.37 mmol, 1.2 equiv.). Methyl iodide (0.37 mmol, 1.2 equiv.) or propargyl bromide (0.37 mmol, 1.2 equiv.) was added for the synthesis of compounds 6 or 7, respectively. After 3 hours stirring at room temperature, the reaction mixture was purified by flash chromatography using a gradient of n-hexane (A) and ethyl acetate (B), going from 10% B to 15% B in 30 minutes, to afford compounds 6 (74.8 mg, 72% yield) and 7 (87.6 mg, 79% yield).

MCF 10A (ATCC CRL-10317\u2122) cells were seeded at the same cell density in 100 \u03bcL in DMEM/F12 medium, containing 5% horse serum, 100 U mL\u22121 penicillin, 0.1 mg mL\u22121 streptomycin, 0.01 mg mL\u22121 insulin, 0.5 \u03bcg mL\u22121 hydrocortisone, 100 ng mL\u22121 cholera toxin, and 20 ng mL\u22121 human epidermal growth factor. Tested compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), serially diluted in the culture medium, and added to the cells. After 48 h, cell media was removed and replaced with fresh medium, the MTT dye solution was added to each well and after 3 h of incubation the media was removed, and intracellular formazan crystals were solubilized and extracted with DMSO. After 15 min at room temperature, absorbance\nwas measured at 570 nm in a microplate reader spectrophotometer (FLUOstar Omega, BMG Labtech, Germany), and the percentage of viable cells was determined for each compound concentration as described previously.15\nThe IC50 values were calculated by the variable slope log(inhibitor) vs. normalized response nonlinear regression model of GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), and data presented as the estimated value (95% confidence intervals).\nVirtual combination index determination\nVirtual combination indices were calculated according to a previously published method.14 Briefly, a purely mathematical approach was taken to allow a comparison of the cytotoxic activity of each hybrid with that of its two relevant fragments, and this was expressed as a virtual combination index (VCI). This was calculated by the Chou method16 by re-analysing the raw data of the MTT assays that gave the IC50 values shown in Table 2. Each hybrid was considered as a 1 : 1 ratio mixture of its two corresponding fragments, and combination index values were computed by the CalcuSyn software (version 2.1, Biosoft). In this context, VCI close to 1 refers to similar, VCI <1 to a stronger, and VCI >1 to a weaker effect of a hybrid than what would be expected based on a simple addition of the effects of its fragments.14"

Specific primary antibodies of phospho-Chk1, phospho-Chk2, Chk1, Chk2, and the internal control GAPDH were individually recognized on the membrane. HRP substrate reacted with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies on the membrane will elicit chemiluminescence, which reflects the relative protein expression levels and can be captured by the Chemiluminescence Imaging System.12"

            "text": "Altogether, we can conclude that the hybrid compounds 11\u201313 are promising new leads against breast cancer, and that in the case of compounds 11 and 13 the anti-TNBC selectivity also exceeds that expected based on the pharmacodynamic properties of their corresponding fragments. Inhibition of the ATR-mediated DNA damage response by compound 13 further emphasizes the drug development potential of this hybrid compound towards an effective and safe therapeutic agent against cancers with mutated p53 including most triple negative cancers."
