    "abstractText": "Anti-hyperlipidaemic effect of chloroform fraction of aerial parts of Zygophyllum indicum (Fagonia indica Burm.f.) was studied in rats. Adult Wistar albino rats were distributed into five groups. Rats of all groups except group I were given an intraperitoneal injection (Triton X-100) to induce hyperlipidaemia. Groups (I and II) served as normal and hyperlipidaemic control groups respectively. Group III and group IV were administered with 250 and 500 mg/kg chloroform fraction of the plant respectively after 18 h of inducing hyperlipidemia. Group V was given 10 mg/kg of the standard atorvastatin. Chloroform fraction had significant (p<0.05) hypolipidaemic effects on lipid profile and biochemical parameters with a protective effect on the liver in comparison to group II. F. indica with hypolipidaemic effect is useful in the management of hyperlipidemia. Chloroform fraction with its constituents can be used as an antihyperlipidaemic supplement in developing countries for the development of novel therapeutic agents.",
