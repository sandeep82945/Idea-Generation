The actual duration of the intervention was 8 weeks.\nThe value appeared incorrectly in the following 7 instances:\n1. Abstract; Methods\nParticipants in the individualized and nonindividualized intervention arms will have 5 weeks to access the app, which includes a PF concepts training session (stage 1) and access to short PF skill activities on demand (stage 2).\nThis has been corrected as follows:\nParticipants in the individualized and nonindividualized intervention arms will have 8 weeks to access the app, which includes a PF concepts training session (stage 1) and access to short PF skill activities on demand (stage 2).\n2.
