Exploration of Anisotropy Effects on Fiber Dispersion: Investigate how the anisotropy of fiber bundles, particularly their orientation relative to the flow or deformation direction, affects the dispersion mechanism. This research could involve detailed computational and experimental studies to quantify how fiber orientation influences the efficiency of dispersion and the mechanical properties of the final composite.

Development of Advanced Imaging Techniques for Real-time Dispersion Monitoring: The current study introduces a novel image-based analysis method for measuring fiber dispersion. Future research could focus on enhancing these imaging techniques, such as developing real-time monitoring systems that can assess fiber dispersion during the extrusion process. This could help in adjusting processing parameters on-the-fly to optimize dispersion and, consequently, the properties of the composite material.

Impact of Fiber Material and Shape on Dispersion Dynamics: Expand the research to include different types of fibers (such as carbon fibers, natural fibers, etc.) and investigate how their material properties and cross-sectional shapes affect dispersion dynamics and mechanical properties of composites. This could lead to optimized selection criteria for fibers in composite manufacturing based on desired properties.

Modeling and Simulation of Multi-pellet Dispersion Mechanisms: While the study touches on multi-pellet dispersion, there is a vast potential for developing detailed computational models that simulate the dispersion behavior in complex flow fields. These models can help in predicting the optimal processing conditions and understanding the interaction between pellets, which is crucial for scaling up the production process.

Investigation of Post-Processing Fiber Length and Mechanical Properties: Conduct a systematic study to correlate the final fiber length after processing (taking into account the dispersion and potential fiber breakage) with the mechanical properties of the composite. This could involve varying the processing conditions to achieve different levels of fiber dispersion and measuring the impact on tensile strength, impact resistance, and other relevant mechanical properties. This research could provide insights into the trade-offs between processing efficiency, fiber length retention, and material performance, leading to guidelines for manufacturing high-performance composites.
