1. **Investigate the long-term effects of antibiotic exposure on bivalves and other aquatic organisms.** This could involve studying the effects of chronic exposure to low levels of antibiotics on bivalve growth, reproduction, and survival. It could also involve investigating the potential for antibiotics to accumulate in bivalve tissues and the potential for these antibiotics to be transferred to humans through consumption of bivalves.


2. **Develop new methods for removing antibiotics from wastewater before it is discharged into the environment.** This could involve developing new filtration or treatment technologies that are specifically designed to remove antibiotics from wastewater. It could also involve investigating the use of natural processes, such as bioremediation, to remove antibiotics from wastewater.


3. **Study the role of antibiotic resistance genes in the spread of antibiotic resistance in aquatic environments.** This could involve investigating the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes in bivalves and other aquatic organisms. It could also involve studying the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes between different types of bacteria in aquatic environments.


4. **Develop new antibiotics that are less likely to contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance.** This could involve developing new antibiotics that target different mechanisms of action than existing antibiotics. It could also involve developing new antibiotics that are less likely to be taken up by bacteria or that are more rapidly degraded in the environment.


5. **Educate the public about the importance of proper antibiotic use and disposal.** This could involve developing educational campaigns that teach people about the importance of taking antibiotics only when they are prescribed by a doctor and of disposing of unused antibiotics properly. It could also involve working with healthcare providers to ensure that antibiotics are prescribed and used appropriately.
