            "text": "During the early stages of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID\u201019) pandemic, almost all countries had to rely on a set of non\u2010pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) in response to growing infection and death numbers. This strategy is still relevant today as new variants of the disease are emerging. The goal of NPIs is to prevent a sharp peak in infections, to take pressure off healthcare systems, and ultimately to save lives and bridge the time gap until full vaccination coverage is reached. In addition to careful hygiene and mandatory face masks, social distancing is perhaps the most important NPI (Cowling & Aiello, 2020). Since maintaining physical distance creates enormous economic and social cost, it is crucial to quantify the benefits of different measures to initially stop or, in later stages, slow down the pandemic.\nOne important public policy to promote physical distancing is to ban mass gatherings (Memish et al., 2019).1 Such events may foster the transmission of contagious disease as a result of large crowds being in close contact, often for\nAbbreviations: HS, high school; IATA, International Air Transport Association; ICU, intensive care unit; MERS, Middle East respiratory syndrome; MLB, Major League Baseball; NBA, National Basketball Association; NFL, National Football League; NHL, National Hockey League; NPI, non\u2010pharmaceutical interventions; SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome; SIPO, shelter\u2010in\u2010place order; WHO, World Health Organization.\nA previous version of this paper has been published in Covid Economics, Vetted and Real\u2010Time Papers.\nThis is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution\u2010NonCommercial\u2010NoDerivs License, which permits use and distribution in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited, the use is non\u2010commercial and no modifications or adaptations are made.\n\u00a9 2023 The Authors.

A temporary mass gathering ban is relatively cheap and easy to implement compared to, for example, school and workplace closures. In response to the spread of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, the pathogen leading to COVID\u201019, several prominent events have been canceled or postponed, even before widespread quarantine measures were enacted (McCloskey et al., 2020). These include religious, cultural, and sporting events. While most major sports leagues in the US have performed without live attendance or at significantly reduced capacity, the debate over the necessity of such restrictions has gathered fresh momentum when the Texas Rangers franchise in the Major League Baseball decided to stage their first game of the 2021 season in front of a full capacity of 40,300. This announcement was met with sharp criticism by experts and politicians, as it was announced during a phase when infection rates in the US were on the rise once again.2 Recent outbreaks have lead US major sport leagues to quarantine a significant number of players, while the National Basketball Association (NBA) and National Hockey League (NHL) were forced to postpone a series of games.3\nWe quantify how NBA and NHL games have contributed to the early spread of COVID\u201019 in the United States.4 Both leagues play exclusively in indoor venues, which present a high\u2010risk setting for infectious disease transmission. Before play was suspended on March 12, up to 12 games per league with an average audience of about 18,000 people were held per day. We analyze how much games held between March 1 and March 11 have contributed to the community spread of COVID\u201019 in counties surrounding NBA and NHL venues. Since the game schedules were determined long before the first COVID\u201019 case became public, their spatial and temporal distribution should be unrelated to the initial spread of COVID\u201019 in the US.5 In fact, we can show that game schedules are not correlated with observable county characteristics and that ticket sales did not systematically change until the NBA and NHL suspended play. While we do not have data on actual game attendance, we note that any no\u2010show behavior would imply that our estimates are conservative and the true effect on COVID\u201019 mortality perhaps much higher.6\nOur results suggest that each additional indoor mass gathering between March 1 and 11 in the form of an NBA or NHL game increased the cumulative number of COVID\u201019 cases (on April 30, 2020) in counties that either host sports venues or are adjacent to venue\u2010hosting counties by at least 269 per million population (p < 0.01) or 9.2% in terms of the average case rate among counties in our sample, and the number of COVID\u201019 deaths per million by 15 (p < 0.01) or 10.3% in terms of the average death rate. These effects are larger in densely populated areas and in colder regions. A placebo check in which we reassign venues to large US cities that currently do not host sports teams confirms our results. We conclude that banning indoor mass gatherings has an enormous potential to save lives. This is especially important given that such measures are relatively easy and cheap to implement.\nOur results contribute to the literature evaluating the role ofmass gatherings in the spread of infectious disease, and the benefits of social distancingmore generally. In a recent survey,Nunan andBrassey (2020) conclude that the impact ofmass gatherings on COVID\u201019 is still poorly understood. Some evidence is originating from outdoor and partly non\u2010randomly scheduled events. Studying outdoor soccermatches in the UK inMarch 2020, Olczak et al. (2020) finds that one additional such event increases the number of COVID\u201019 deaths per million by 20. Focusing on the reopening of soccer stadiums to reduced crowds during the second COVID\u201019 wave in Germany in late summer/autumn, Fischer (2022) finds moderate effects of an additional game on regional infection rates. These findings are not surprising, as hygiene concepts had been in place across the board. In addition, reopening was certainly endogenous, as the pandemic situation was well monitored during that time in Germany. This certainly had repercussions on the potential COVID\u201019 spread, as scheduling of games and certainly spectator allowancewas adapted according to regional pandemic indicators. In a closely related study, Carlin et al. (2021) take a similar empirical approach and arrive at comparable conclusions as we do.\nAnother notable contribution is Mangrum and Niekamp (2020), who present evidence that college student travel contributed to the spread of COVID\u201019. Their estimates show that counties with more early spring break students had higher confirmed case growth rates than counties with fewer early spring break students. A very particular type of mass gathering is considered by Dave et al. (2021), who analyze the effects of the January 6, 2020 US Capitol riots on the spread of COVID\u201019. They find no significant contribution of this event on the pandemic.\nFor other infectious diseases there is more evidence, but mostly in the form of retrospective observational studies (Hoang & Gautret, 2018; Karami et al., 2019; Rainey et al., 2016). The best available evidence suggests that multiple\u2010day events with crowded communal accommodations are most strongly associated with increased risk of infection (Nunan & Brassey, 2020). Two papers relate sport events to local seasonal influenza mortality. Stoecker et al. (2016) show that National Football League team appearances in the Super Bowl caused a 18% increase in flu mortality in the population over age 65, and Cardazzi et al. (2020) find that US cities which get to host a professional sports team experience an increase in local influenza mortality by an estimated 4%\u201324%. Our estimates contribute to the growing design\u2010based evidence on the impact of mass gatherings on the community spread of COVID\u201019.\nOther NPIs have received more attention in the context of COVID\u201019. These studies differ with respect to outcomes, interventions, and geographic coverage. Gupta et al. (2020) demonstrate how different state\u2010 and county\u2010level measures\nhttps://onlinelibrary.w iley.com /doi/10.1111/coep.12602 by Johannes K epler U niversit\u00e4t L inz, W iley O nline L ibrary on [14/02/2023].

The authors proxy mobility with cell signal data, and find SIPOs to have the largest mobility\u2010reducing impact. Two studies examine the impact of SIPOs on COVID\u201019 cases and deaths. Dave, Friedson, Matsuzawa & Sabia (2020) exploit variation in SIPOs across time and all US states. Their results suggest that approximately 3 weeks following the adoption of a SIPO, cumulative COVID\u201019 cases fell by 44%. Friedson et al. (2020) focus on California, which was the first state to enact a SIPO. Using a synthetic control design, they find that California's SIPO reduced cases by 125.5 per 100,000 population and deaths by 1661. Similar evidence is provided for Texas (Dave et al., 2020b). All these papers use difference\u2010in\u2010differences designs,7 which Goodman\u2010Bacon and Marcus (2020) provide a critical account of in the context of evaluating NPIs. Glaeser et al. (2020) investigate the effect of SIPO regulations on mobility and COVID\u201019 infections for five large US cities. They estimate a decrease in infections of 19% for every 10% point fall in mobility.\nExtensive work has focused on previous pandemics. However, the majority of these studies are descriptive in nature. Studying the 1918 influenza pandemic, Bootsma and Ferguson (2007), Hatchett et al. (2007), and Markel et al. (2007), for example, find a strong correlation between excess mortality and how early public health measures were enacted in US cities. It is difficult to infer causality from these results, since NPIs are not exogenous and may be enacted in response to preexisting trends in death rates. Barro (2020) attempts to account for this endogeneity by using the distance to army ports in Boston as instrumental variables for NPI introduction. He argues that, because the influenza spread from Boston to other US cities, the farther away cities are from Boston, the more time they had to react and implement NPIs. Barro finds no effect on overall deaths, but that the ratio of peak to average deaths decreased (i.e., a flatter curve). Chapelle (2020) finds a similar pattern using a difference\u2010in\u2010differences model exploiting differences in the timing of NPI introduction. He claims that the lack of herd immunity in subsequent years offset the initial reduction in deaths during the peak of the pandemic, which led to an overall zero effect on deaths.\nAdda (2016) investigates the effects of school closures on the transmission of different virus diseases, and find a significant disease prevalence reducing effect. However, he concludes that school closures, as well as other policies reducing inter\u2010personal contacts, are not cost\u2010effective. For recent influenza waves, there is some suggestive evidence that school closures (e.g., Earn, 2012; Wheeler et al., 2010) and workplace social distancing (e.g., Ahmed et al., 2018; Miyaki et al., 2011) may be associated with lower disease transmission. However, this literature consists mostly of small case studies on scheduled school closures (e.g., during holidays) or single firms. Viner et al. (2020) conclude that school closures were largely ineffective in controlling past Coronavirus outbreaks (i.e., SARS and MERS). The cost of school and workplace closures are massive. Fuchs\u2010Sch\u00fcndeln et al. (2020) argue that school closures associated with COVID\u2010 19 lead to substantial and permanent welfare losses for children, which can only partly be offset by parental reactions. These long\u2010lasting effects are confirmed by Agostinelli et al. (2020). Sadique et al. (2008) estimate that school closures in the United Kingdom could cost up to \u00a31.2 billion per week.\nIn the early stages of COVID\u201019, Alexander and Karger (2020) find that people already traveled 9% less and made 13% fewer visits to non\u2010essential businesses. Their preliminary evidence suggests that consumer spending for over 1 million small US business may be reduced by 40%. In a recent survey, respondents reported average wealth losses due to COVID\u201019 of about $33,000 (Coibion et al., 2020). However, Greenstone and Nigam (2020) estimate that even a moderate form of social distancing (i.e., isolation of suspect cases and their family members and social distancing of the elderly) beginning in March 2020 can reduce COVID\u201019 fatalities by almost 1.8 million over the following 6 months, amounting to economic benefits of almost $8 trillion. Similarly, Thunstr\u00f6m et al. (2020) estimate the potential benefits of social distancing at around $5.2 trillion.\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes our data sources. In Section 3, we present our estimation strategy. Sections 4 and 5 report the main results and a heterogeneity analysis. Section 6 presents results from different placebo tests. Section 7 reports different sensitivity checks. Section 8 provides concluding comments. Additional figures and tables we delegate to the Appendix."

Additionally, we compute the average number of cases and deaths across each set of neighboring counties. The highest increases are in Essex County, NJ; Orleans Parish, LA; and Suffolk County, MA.\nTo generate our treatment variable, we use information on NBA and NHL games played between March 1 and March 11.9 During this time span, 78 NBA games (on average about 7 per day) and 57 NHL games (on average 5 per day) were played in US venues. Both leagues suspended all remaining games for the 2019/2020 season indefinitely on March 12. The NBA canceled two games right before tip\u2010off on March 11: Utah Jazz at Oklahoma City Thunder, where Utah player Rudy Gobert tested positive for COVID\u201019 prior to the game, and New Orleans Pelicans at Sacramento Kings, due to a suspected infection involving a referee who was part of the officiating crew in a Utah Jazz game earlier the same week. We do not include these two games in our analysis.\nTo generate covariates, we collect county\u2010level data from different sources. First, we obtain data on population by age, sex, and ethnicity from the 2016 US census provided by the Survey of Epidemiology and End Results, US State and County Population Data.10 Second, we use a set of county\u2010level socioeconomic and healthcare\u2010related variables linked to COVID spread provided by Killeen et al. (2020). These include the 2018 unemployment rate, the share of population with a high school degree, the number of housing units per million population, the median household income, the number of hospitals, ICU beds, physician assistants, and nurses per million population. Third, we draw data on the number of large (international) airports in a county from the International Air Transport Association. Fourth, we use 2020 survey information from Morning Consult to construct the share of Black fans for each NBA and NHL team.11\nTo stratify our analysis, we use, among others, information on population density, climate, and the timing of SIPOs. The information on county land area is collected from the US Census Bureau.12 Historical climate data on the county\u2010 level, including data on April temperatures, are collected from the National Centers for Environmental Information.13 Finally, information on the introduction of SIPOs on the state level is taken from Dave, Friedson, Matsuzawa & Sabia (2020). Descriptive statistics for all variables used in our empirical analysis by county type are presented in Table 1."

The average death rate in venue and adjacent counties is 147.9 with a standard deviation of 262.5 (see Table 1). The explanatory variable of primary interest, gamesc(v,s), measures the cumulative number of games (NBA and NHL) at venue v between March 1 and 11. Starting from March 12, both leagues suspended their seasons and all games were canceled.14 On average, there were 3.5 games, with considerable variation to exploit: The number of games varies between 0 and 16, with a standard deviation of 2.69.\nWe note two important things. First, since our treatment is time\u2010invariant, we construct our sample as a cross\u2010 section. Second, we assume that venue counties and counties adjacent to venue counties are affected in the same manner by a sports game. If an adjacent county is in the perimeter of multiple venue counties, we add up the number of games the adjacent county is exposed to.15 This set\u2010up translates to the following dose response model:\nCOVID\u201019 deathsc\u00f0v;s\u00de \u00bc \u03b2 \u22c5 gamesc\u00f0v;s\u00de \u00fe Xc\u03b4 \u00fe X \u03b3s \u00fe \u03b5c\u00f0v;s\u00de; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere Xc are county\u2010level controls, and \u03b3s are state fixed effects. Our county\u2010level controls comprise population density, the sex\u2010race\u2010age distribution, and a set of sociodemographic and healthcare\u2010related variables possibly correlated with COVID\u201019 spread that are listed in Section 2.16 We refrain from including venue fixed effects, as we observe 75 counties which are affected by events held at more than one venue. We estimate model (1) with county population weights.\nOur main parameter of interest is \u03b2, which captures the impact of an additional mass gathering due to a NBA or NHL game on the cumulative number of COVID\u201019 deaths. Given that the game schedules were determined long before the first COVID\u201019 case became public, there should be no correlation between gamesc(v,s) and the error term \u025bc(v,s). This identifying assumption is supported by the fact that the number of games does not correlate with observed county characteristics (see Appendix Table A.1).\nThere are four potential issues in regards to the interpretation of our estimate. First, there could be anticipation effects, in the sense that people may increasingly had refrained from visiting games prior to the lockdown. This would lead to an attenuation bias, which implies that our estimate is a lower bound of the actual effect. Unfortunately we do not have data on game attendance, but we can show that ticket sales did not systematically change before suspension of play (see Appendix Figure A.2). Second, our results can only speak to US counties that either host or are adjacent to a sports venue. These are primarily urban regions, where disease may spread more rapidly than in lesser populated areas. Also, there may be spillovers to counties not in the data that we cannot account for.

This again implies that our findings are conservative estimates. Third, for now we assume that an additional game has the same effect on each county. This may be a strong assumption, because there are substantial disparities in land area and population density across counties. To account for this heterogeneity, we provide separate estimates for low and high population density areas in Section 5. Fourth, there may be differences in testing availability we cannot account for. This is the reason why we consider both cases and deaths as an outcome, where the latter should be less affected by access to tests. Also, we believe that most of the variation in testing is captured by our state fixed effects."

            "text": "Our estimation results are summarized in Tables 2 and 3. We estimate the model in Equation (1) both on the cumulative number of COVID\u201019 cases (Table 2) and deaths (Table 3) per million population. We find a significant positive effect of the number of mass gatherings on both of these outcomes. Our preferred estimates (column 5) indicate that each additional mass gathering between March 1 and 11 increased cases by 269 per million and deaths by approximately 15 per million population. These are substantial effects. Compared to the average case and death rates across the counties in the data, our estimates correspond to increases of 9.2% and 10.3% per game, respectively. Both estimates are statistically significant at the 1% level.\nThese findings are robust across different specifications. In column (1), we show the unconditional relationship between cases/deaths and games. In column (2), we introduce state fixed effects. In column (3), we additionally include a binary indicator capturing whether the county hosts a venue or is an adjacent county, the population density, and the shares of non\u2010Whites, people above 60 years of age, and females in the population. In column (4), we alternatively use the full interacted sex\u2010race\u2010age distribution, defined as a set of 16 variables capturing the share of sex g, of race h, and in age\u2010group i in the population; where h is White or non\u2010White, and i is 0\u201319, 20\u201339, 40\u201359, or 60+. Column (5) additionally controls for a set of sociodemographic and healthcare\u2010related variables that may be related to COVID\u201019 spread. This is our preferred specification. When analyzing deaths in Table 3, we additionally control for the number of confirmed cases by March 13 in columns (3) to (5). Our covariates do not have causal interpretations, hence we refrain from interpreting them.\nIn Figure 2, we provide an overview on the dynamics underlying these effects. The horizontal axis measures time from March 1 to April 30. The black squares capture the cumulative number of games (NBA plus NHL) before the leagues suspended play on March 12, which is indicated by the red line. The hollow circles measure the estimated effect of an additional game on the cumulative number of COVID\u201019 cases (Panel A) and deaths (Panel B) on each day between March 13 and April 30. Each estimate comes from a separate regression, with the dependent variable being measured on different days. The right\u2010most estimate is our baseline. A priori, we expect effects to be strongest around 3 weeks after the shutdown. This is precisely what we find. The effect of games starts to pick up around March 19 and increases at a decreasing rate since then. This is true for both cases and deaths. Furthermore, we see that cases respond sooner than deaths, which makes sense given the natural lag between diagnosis and death. In terms of magnitudes, estimates for COVID\u201019 deaths (cases) range between 0.002 (0.367) on March 13 and 15.195 (269.131) on April 30.\nIf we split our treatment variable and count NBA and NHL games separately, we find that games in both leagues positively affect COVID\u201019 spread (Table A.2 in the Appendix). While the effect on cases (column 1) is statistically insignificant for NHL games, the point estimate is indeed economically significant at over 200. When looking at deaths, we find large positive effects for both leagues."

We do also find different effects if we split the sample by the share of Black people in the population. The estimated effects for deaths are driven by counties with a low share of Black people.

However, the literature has not yet reached consensus whether this is indeed the case for COVID\u201019. While some early reports from China document a negative correlation between temperature and COVID\u201019 spread (e.g., Wang et al., 2020), others find no such (or even a positive) connection (e.g., Ma et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2020). Note that, because we consider indoor mass gatherings, temperature plays a lesser role for primary infections, but it may be important in determining the extent of secondary and subsequent infections. While the effect for deaths is somewhat larger for counties that adopted SIPO late, we do not find pronounced effect heterogeneity by how early states enacted SIPO orders.17 We assume that this is because SIPO timing measures two countervailing effects; while SIPOs reduce disease transmission, early\u2010adopter states may also be more strongly hit by the pandemic."

            "text": "If our results indeed measure the effect of sports games on COVID\u201019 deaths, we should not find systematic effects on deaths in counties that are not exposed to sports games. Therefore, we suggest an in\u2010space placebo test using continental US counties outside our sample to validate our results.18 We think of this as randomly reassigning venues to counties not in our data (i.e., the white\u2010colored counties in Figure 1), and repeating our estimations from above. To construct this hypothetical scenario, we identify counties that are similar in observables to our venue counties. Essentially, we approach this by estimating conditional propensities to host a venue for each county, and then look for nearest\u2010neighbor pairs in terms of these propensity scores. We then construct perimeters around each placebo county, similar to our main sample.19 This gives us a sample of 38 placebo venue counties, and 148 adjacent counties. The results of this exercise are summarized in Figure 4. To show how estimates change over time, we repeat our rolling window estimates from before. We find robust zero effects on both cases and deaths.\nIn a similar vein, we randomly reassign the number of games across the counties in our sample 500 times and plot the resulting treatment effects ordered by their magnitude. This is shown in Appendix Figure A.3. As expected, our baseline findings indicated by the blue triangles are among the largest estimates of this permutation exercise. For cases (panel a), the true estimate ranks first and for deaths (panel b) it ranks fourth across permutations.\nIn a final placebo test, we control for away games in our estimations. Although fans may still gather to watch the games, this variable should have less of an influence on COVID\u201019 transmissions in the home venue county and its perimeter. This is confirmed by Appendix Table A.3, where we add the number of a team's away games between March 1 and March 11 as a control variable to our main specification. We find that the home game coefficients remain practically unchanged, while the point estimate on away games is statistically insignificant."

First, we modify our estimation sample by omitting each state once and estimating effects for all remaining states. This exercise is in the spirit of jackknife resampling; it should reveal whether individual states have enough leverage to drive our estimates. We obtain 31 different leave\u2010one\u2010out estimation samples, the estimates based on those samples are summarized in Appendix Figure A.4. Panel A shows the estimated coefficients for the cumulative number of COVID\u201019 cases on April 30. All estimated coefficients are statistically significant and have overlapping 95% confidence intervals. Panel B shows the estimated coefficients for the cumulative number of COVID\u201019 deaths. With one exception, all coefficients are statistically significant, and confidence intervals are again overlapping.\nWe want to point out two observations. First, omitting California leads to wider confidence intervals. This can be explained by the fact that a substantial number of counties in our sample are located in California (26 counties or 10.74%). If we reduce the sample in such a substantial manner, our estimate is still positive but not statistically significant at the 5% level. Second, omitting New York reduces the estimated effect size from 15 deaths (269 cases) to 7.6 deaths (109 cases). The estimated coefficients are still statistically significant at the 10% levels, and the corresponding confidence intervals overlap with those resulting from the other restricted samples. Overall, we conclude that our findings are not driven by a certain state.\nhttps://onlinelibrary.w iley.com /doi/10.1111/coep.12602 by Johannes K epler U niversit\u00e4t L inz, W iley O nline L ibrary on [14/02/2023].

For the cumulative number of COVID\u201019 cases, we obtain larger coefficients with larger standard errors (see Panel A.1 in Appendix Figure A.5). For the cumulative number of COVID\u201019 deaths, the coefficients hardly change, but standard errors increase somewhat (see Panel A.2 in Appendix Figure A.5). For both outcomes, the overall pattern is comparable to our weighted baseline estimates.\nF I GURE 4 Placebo test: Reassigning teams to non\u2010venue counties and applying game schedule. These figures presents estimates from an in\u2010space placebo test, where we reassign venues to counties not in our data that are closest in terms of observables to the venue counties, and apply the leagues' game schedules to the matched placebo counties.

In our baseline estimation, we refrained from clustering, since we have a rather low number of clusters and some clusters have only few observations (see Figure 1; Cameron & Miller, 2015). It is reassuring that our estimates on the cumulative number of COVID\u201019 cases and deaths remain highly statistically significant if we use clustered standard errors at the venue level (see Panels B.1 and B.2 in Appendix Figure A.5).\nFourth, to use the dynamic nature of our outcome data, we construct an alternative data set where cumulative cases and deaths are measured over time in a panel covering 30 days from April 1\u201330, with the treatment variable being held fixed (i.e., games between March 1 and 11). Tables A.4 (cases) and A.5 (deaths) in the Appendix present these results. In column 1, we estimate the effect of the cumulative number of games from March 1 to 11 on daily cases and deaths between April 1 and 30. We estimate an increase of over 200 confirmed COVID\u201019 cases and 9 deaths for each additional game. Columns 2 through 4 split the outcome window in three parts; April 1\u201310 (column 2), April 11\u201320 (column 3), and April 21\u201330 (column 4). Here we see that the estimated effects increase over time, similar to our static model. In column 5, we use the number of cumulative games lagged by 1 month as the treatment variable and estimate effects for the first 11 days of April.20 Since the lagged number of games is time\u2010varying, we can estimate these models with county fixed effects. The results confirm the positive effect of the cumulative number of games on COVID\u201019 cases and deaths. We can also use this data set to estimate event studies where the number of games is interacted with dummy variables indicating every day between April 1 and April 30 (Figure A.6 in the Appendix). This leads to very similar effect patterns as in Figure 2, where we estimate separate regressions for every day.\nFinally, we log\u2010transform our outcome variables and reestimate our models in Table A.6 in the Appendix. We find that, across specifications, coefficients are positive and statistically significant. Our most conservative estimates would imply an 11.2% increase in infections (panel A, column 5) and 13.7% increase in deaths (panel B, column 5). Overall, we are confident that our estimates indeed measure a causal effect of indoor mass gatherings on COVID\u201019 mortality."

            "heading": "8 | POLICY CONCLUSIONS",
            "text": "As argued by Adda (2016), it is crucial to understand which measures are able to effectively contain a new virus pandemic at a particular point of time. During the COVID\u201019 pandemic, mass gatherings have been an important consideration in terms of possible safety protocols and NPIs. In particular, sports leagues worldwide have contemplated when to stop operations, restrict attendances, or adapt COVID\u201019 safety protocols.\nIn this paper, we present estimates for the impact of mass gatherings in the form of NBA or NHL games on the community spread of COVID\u201019 in the US. We find that one additional game increased the cumulative number of COVID\u201019 deaths in urban areas and surrounding counties by 10.3%. Multiplying this by the average number of games in affected counties (3.47) yields a 36% increase, which amounts to around half of the difference in death rates between affected counties and matched placebo counties that do not host or are adjacent to sports venues, which we used for a robustness check. We conclude that banning mass gatherings is an effective NPI to slow the spread of COVID\u201019.\nSince our results stem from a time where wearing face masks was still uncommon, we interpret our results as upper bound estimates of the benefits of canceling games in future pandemics if mask mandates and other hygiene measures are enacted by sports venues. Also, holding events without live audiences may be helpful to mitigate disease transmission while minimizing welfare losses that come with canceling sports games. Our results show that team's away games do not seem to affect COVID\u201019 spread, which suggests that fans meeting to watch games at home had not been an important driver of the pandemic. Finally, our results indicate the consequences of reopening indoor sports venues at full capacity without elaborate hygiene concepts or sufficient vaccination coverage, even when infection and death rates are low.\nWhile the benefits of banning mass gatherings are tremendous, the cost are likely low. Estimates in NBA circles suggest, for example, that each game yields an average $1.2 million in gate revenue.21 This figure comprises all game\u2010 day revenue, including tickets and concessions, but excludes revenues from TV and sponsoring deals and the resulting consumer surplus.22 The latter two components might not be lost if games are played without audience. More importantly, however, the opportunity cost of banning sports games are likely much lower than those of other NPIs. This is supported by a recent upswing in TV ratings for the NBA and NHL.23 While it is inevitable that some jobs may be lost in the process, we believe that the resulting human capital loss is orders of magnitude smaller than what we would expect from, for example, school or workplace closures. We cannot rule out though, that sport audiences might change\nhttps://onlinelibrary.w iley.com /doi/10.1111/coep.12602 by Johannes K epler U niversit\u00e4t L inz, W iley O nline L ibrary on [14/02/2023].

Consequently, to be effective, any NPI directed at (indoor) mass gatherings should account for potential substitution effects.\nA major limitation of our study is that we cannot speak to outdoor mass gatherings. Overwhelming evidence suggests that COVID\u201019 is primarily transmitted via aerosols (Bourouiba, 2020; Morawska & Cao, 2020), which implies that indoor gatherings carry a particularly high risk for infection. Outdoor events, especially when certain safety protocols (minimum physical distance, mandatory masks, etc.) are established, may be less risky. There is first evidence, for example, that the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests in the US did not lead to in increase in COVID\u201019 cases and deaths (Dave et al., 2020a)."

            "text": "1 The WHO describes a mass gathering as \u201ca planned or spontaneous event where the number of people attending could strain the planning and response resources of the community or country hosting the event. The Olympic Games, The Hajj, and other major sporting, religious, and cultural events are all examples of a mass gathering.\u201d\n2 See for example, https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/01/us/politics/biden\u2010espn\u2010baseball\u2010georgia.html. 3 See for example, https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/19/sports/football/sports\u2010covid\u2010testing\u2010postponed\u2010games.html. 4 We focus on NBA and NHL because their seasons were ongoing when COVID\u201019 broke out. The NFL was in offseason and the MLB in spring training, which involves scrimmage games in smaller ballparks held in Arizona and Florida.\n5 The first known case in the US was a Washington State man who returned January 15, 2020 from Wuhan. The NBA 2019/2020 schedule had been released on August 12, 2019, the NHL schedule on June 25, 2019.\n6 Evidence from Belarusian soccer, which did not suspend play, indicates that sports attendance did decline somewhat in the early stages of COVID\u201019 (Reade et al., 2020).\n7 There are also a number of non\u2010US studies. Fang et al. (2020) study the case of Wuhan (China), and Hsiang et al. (2020) study localities within China, France, Iran, Italy, South Korea, and the US.\n8 The information on COVID\u201019 cases and deaths up to April 30, 2020 is obtained from a database maintained by The New York Times, which collects county\u2010level information from reports of state and local health agencies (see nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus\u2010 us\u2010cases.html). In our main analysis, we exclude New York City. Data on COVID\u201019 cases and deaths are not available for city boroughs separately. Adjacent counties in New Jersey and New York are coded as affected by games in New York City.\n9 The information on NBA games is scraped from Basketball Reference (see basketball\u2010reference.com). Data on NHL games are collected from Hockey Reference (see hockey\u2010reference.com). Since we focus on US territory, we disregard 16 NHL games played in Canada. No NBA game was played in Toronto during the relevant time span.\n10 Data are available at data.nber.org/seer\u2010pop/desc/ (last accessed July 27, 2022). 11 Data available at morningconsult.com/2020/09/10/sports\u2010fan\u2010base\u2010demographic\u2010data (last accessed July 27, 2022). 12 Data are available at https://data.census.gov/cedsci (last accessed July 27, 2022). 13 The NOAA's Climate Divisional Database is available at data.nodc.noaa.gov/cgi\u2010bin/iso?id=gov.noaa.ncdc:C00005 (last accessed July 27, 2022).\n14 Prior to that only two games on March 11 were canceled. In both cases, players were tested/suspected for COVID\u201019. 15 For example, Orange county (CA) is in the perimeter of Los Angeles county, and vice versa. Hence, we assume that Orange county was exposed to NBA games from the LA Clippers and the LA Lakers (both have their venue in Los Angeles county), and NHL games from the\nhttps://onlinelibrary.w iley.com /doi/10.1111/coep.12602 by Johannes K epler U niversit\u00e4t L inz, W iley O nline L ibrary on [14/02/2023].

Orange county is also the venue county for the Anaheim Ducks. In total, 8 (3.31%) of all counties are treated by more than one NHL venue county, and 5 (2.07%) of all counties are treated by 2 NBA venues.\n16 Unfortunately, we were unable to find reliable data on other large mass gatherings, such as concerts, on the county level. However, we believe that this likely does not affect our estimates, because (1) the number of games is pre\u2010determined by the league schedule and unlikely to be related to other large mass gatherings, and (2) our rich set of covariates would account for most of the between\u2010perimeter variation in other mass gatherings anyways.\n17 Note that SIPO orders could also be considered an outcome of mass gatherings. However, we do not find that the number of NBA/NHL games is significantly associated with whether SIPO orders are in place or the length of SIPO orders in a county (these results are available upon request).\n18 Note since our treatment is defined in a cross\u2010sectional spirit, the spatial distribution of venues is the only possible variation we can use to perform a placebo test. In particular, it is not possible to do in\u2010time placebo tests within our estimation sample, since there is serial correlation in COVID\u201019 cases/deaths, and any effect we measure in these counties will always pick up the treatment effect too.\n19 Each non\u2010venue county can appear in only one placebo perimeter. 20 For example, on April 5, the value of the treatment variable would be the cumulative number of games by March 5. 21 See, for example, https://www.nbcsports.com/chicago/bulls/report\u2010nba\u2010could\u2010lose\u2010nearly\u2010500\u2010million\u2010ticket\u2010revenue\u2010without\u2010games, accessed June 9, 2020.\n22 Other factors we cannot account for that would likely increase the cost of banning mass gatherings are, among others, effects on revenues of local restaurants and bars.\n23 In case of the NBA, see https://www.forbes.com/sites/shlomosprung/2021/01/21/nba\u2010tv\u2010ratings\u2010on\u2010tnt\u2010espn\u2010abc\u2010up\u201034\u2010from\u2010last\u2010year\u2010per\u2010 nielsen/?sh=69378f964ddc and https://theathletic.com/2352601/2021/01/29/nhl\u2010tv\u2010ratings\u2010social\u2010media/ for the NHL."
