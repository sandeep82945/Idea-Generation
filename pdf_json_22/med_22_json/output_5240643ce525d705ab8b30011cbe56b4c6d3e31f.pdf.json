    "abstractText": "Heart failure (HF) is a global pandemic which affects about 26 million people. PFKM (Phosphofructokinase, Muscle), catalyzing the phosphorylation of fructose\u20106\u2010phosphate, plays a very important role in cardiovascular diseases. However, the effect of PFKM in glycolysis and HF remains to be elucidated. H9c2 rat cardiomyocyte cells were treated with doxorubicin (DOX) to establish injury models, and the cell viability, apoptosis and glycolysis were measured. Quantitative reverse transcription\u2010polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) and immunoblotting were used for gene expression. DOX treatment significantly inhibited PFKM expression in H9c2 cells. Overexpression of PFKM inhibited DOX\u2010induced cell apoptosis and DOX\u2010decreased glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), while silencing PFKM promoted cell apoptosis and inhibited glycolysis and OXPHOS in H9c2 cells. Moreover, PFKM regulated DOX\u2010mediated cell viability and apoptosis through glycolysis pathway. Mechanism study showed that histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) inhibited H3K27ac\u2010induced transcription of PFKM in DOX\u2010treated cells and regulated glycolysis. PFKM could inhibit DOX\u2010induced cardiotoxicity by enhancing OXPHOS and glycolysis, which might benefit us in developing novel therapeutics for prevention or treatment of HF.",

            "text": "cardiotoxicity by enhancing oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis Min Zhou, Xiao Sun, Chunli Wang, Fengdan Wang, Chuibi Fang & Zhenlei Hu*\nHeart failure (HF) is a global pandemic which affects about 26 million people. PFKM (Phosphofructokinase, Muscle), catalyzing the phosphorylation of fructose\u20116\u2011phosphate, plays a very important role in cardiovascular diseases. However, the effect of PFKM in glycolysis and HF remains to be elucidated. H9c2 rat cardiomyocyte cells were treated with doxorubicin (DOX) to establish injury models, and the cell viability, apoptosis and glycolysis were measured. Quantitative reverse transcription\u2011polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2011PCR) and immunoblotting were used for gene expression. DOX treatment significantly inhibited PFKM expression in H9c2 cells. Overexpression of PFKM inhibited DOX\u2011induced cell apoptosis and DOX\u2011decreased glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), while silencing PFKM promoted cell apoptosis and inhibited glycolysis and OXPHOS in H9c2 cells. Moreover, PFKM regulated DOX\u2011mediated cell viability and apoptosis through glycolysis pathway. Mechanism study showed that histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) inhibited H3K27ac\u2011induced transcription of PFKM in DOX\u2011treated cells and regulated glycolysis. PFKM could inhibit DOX\u2011induced cardiotoxicity by enhancing OXPHOS and glycolysis, which might benefit us in developing novel therapeutics for prevention or treatment of HF.\nHeart failure (HF) is a clinical syndrome caused by defects in myocardium resulting in impairment of ventricular filling or the ejection of blood1. HF symptoms include\u00a0breathlessness, ankle swelling, and fatigue, accompanied by pulmonary rales, peripheral oedema, etc.2. HF is a global pandemic and its prevalence is still increasing3. The major HF risk factors heart disease, cardiopulmonary disease, etc.4. Evaluation factors for HF include\u00a0physical examination, blood tests, levels of serum creatinine and glucose, liver function tests etc.1. Measurement of plasma concentrations of brain natriuretic peptide is a mainstay for the diagnosis of HF5. The burden of HF is huge, study show that estimated mean cost of HF was $11 552 in 2014 in USA6. More importantly,\u00a0HF is\u00a0still increasing in prevalence3. Therefore,\u00a0a better understanding of the pathogenesis of HF will benefit us in the prevention and treatment of HF.\nHyperglycemia by impairing glucose\u00a0metabolism is an emerging risk factor for cancer and cardiovascular disease.\u00a0Hyperglycemia reduces ipilimumab-related anticancer functions and enhances its cardiotoxicity through mechanisms mediated by MyD88 and NLRP3 signaling7, suggesting that targeting the MyD88/NLRP3 signaling may be beneficial in patients with cancer and cardiovascular diseases in response to ipilimumab-induced anticancer effects and cardiotoxicity. Glucose can be metabolized by glycolysis to lactate. PFKM (Phosphofructokinase, Muscle)\u00a0regulates glycolysis via\u00a0catalyzing the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate8. PFKM has been shown to be involved in various pathological processes. For example, Gao et\u00a0al. have reported that\u00a0S-nitrosylation at Cys351 of PFKM\u00a0promoted cell proliferation, and increased tumor growth and metastasis of ovarian cancer9. A study identified PFKM as a breast cancer gene10. Another study indicated that celastrol directly inhibits PFKM to induce weight loss11. PFKM also plays a very important role in cardiovascular diseases. For example, PFKM mutation causes myopathy8. PFK deficiency results in a severe cardiac and hematological disorder12. However, the exact role of PFKM in cardiotoxicity remains elusive.\nGlycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) produce energy for cells13. OXPHOS is the process by which ATP synthesis is coupled to the movement of electrons through the mitochondrial electron transport chain and the associated consumption of oxygen14. Glycolysis converts glucose to lactate and provides ATP under anaerobic conditions15. Dysfunction of OXPHOS or glycolysis has been associated with a variety of\nOPEN"

For instance,\u00a0it has been reported that defects in OXPHOS in insulin-sensitive tissues contribute to type 2 diabetes16. Defect of OXPHOS system has been linked to neurodegeneration including Alzheimer disease, Huntington disease, etc.17. An adipocyte-specific defect in OXPHOS increases systemic energy expenditure18. OXPHOS also regulates cardiovascular diseases. For example, coronary artery disease subjects showed suppressed function of complexes I, II and III19. Glycolysis also plays a role in HF. Increased glycolysis was found in failing hearts20. HF animals showed a remarkable increase in glycolysis21. Despite the advance of studies on HF, PFKM, and\u00a0OXPHOS/glycolysis, the exact role of PFKM in OXPHOS/glycolysis and how it does affect\u00a0HF are still unclear and remain to be elucidated."

DOX treatment not only dose-dependently decreased the expression of PFKM (Fig.\u00a01A\u2013C), but also time-dependently suppressed\u00a0the expression of PFKM (Fig.\u00a01D\u2013F), suggesting that\u00a0DOX inhibited PFKM expression in H9c2 cells.\nPFKM upregulation abolished DOX\u2011induced cell apoptosis and DOX\u2011suppressed OXPHOS and glycolysis in H9c2 cells. To further investigate the role of PFKM, PFKM was overexpressed. PFKM overexpression significantly increased DOX-inhibited cell viability (Fig.\u00a02A), decreased DOX-promoted apoptosis (Fig.\u00a02B,C), and reversed DOX-decreased PFKM, Bcl-2, and DOX-increased Bax (Fig.\u00a02D,E). Overexpression of PFKM also abolished DOX-inhibited OCR and ECAR (Fig.\u00a02F,G), and reversed DOX-decreased levels of ATP (Fig.\u00a02H) and lactate levels (Fig.\u00a02I). The results show that overexpressing PFKM abolished DOX-induced cell apoptosis and\u00a0DOX-suppressed OXPHOS and glycolysis.\nPFKM downregulation promoted cell apoptosis and inhibited OXPHOS and glycolysis in H9c2 cells. Next, PFKM was silenced to further study its role. Silencing PFKM significantly inhibited cell viability (Fig.\u00a03A), promoted apoptosis (Fig.\u00a03B,C), and inhibited PFKM, Bcl-2, but increased Bax (Fig.\u00a03D,E). Silencing PFKM also suppressed OCR and ECAR (Fig.\u00a03F,G), and decreased levels of ATP (Fig.\u00a03H) and lactate (Fig.\u00a03I).

To find out how PFKM regulates cell viability, glycolysis inhibitor, 2-DG, was introduced. Results showed that inhibition of glycolysis not only significantly promoted DOX-suppressed cell viability, but also abolished PFKM-overexpression-increased cell viability (Fig.\u00a0 4A). TUNEL staining results showed that inhibition of glycolysis not only significantly increased DOX-increased cell apoptosis, but also abolished PFKM-overexpression-decreased cell apoptosis (Fig.\u00a04B,C). The findings suggest that\u00a0PFKM regulates DOX-mediated growth and apoptosis via the glycolysis pathway.\nHDAC1 inhibited H3K27ac\u2011induced transcription of PFKM in DOX\u2011induced H9c2 cells. To figure out the mechanism by which PFKM is regulated, levels of\u00a0H3K27ac and HDAC1 in DOX-treated H9c2 cells were measured. Results showed that DOX suppressed H3K27ac in a time-dependent manner, but increased the expression of HDAC1 (Fig.\u00a05A,B). ChIP assay revealed that DOX treatment significantly suppressed the interaction between H3K27ac and the PFKM promoter (Fig.\u00a05C). HDAC inhibitor, mocetinostat (MGCD), significantly promoted the interaction between H3K27ac and the PFKM promoter (Fig.\u00a05D) and increased PKFM\nFigure\u00a02.

Overexpressing of PFKM inhibited DOX-induced cell apoptosis and DOX-decreased glycolysis, while silencing PFKM promoted cell apoptosis and inhibited OXPHOS and glycolysis in H9c2 cells. Moreover, PFKM regulated DOX-mediated cell growth and apoptosis via glycolysis pathway. Data also supports that the expression of PFKM was suppressed by HDAC1 through regulating H3K27 acetylation.\u00a0For the first time, we show that\u00a0HDAC1-mediated PFKM down-regulation\u00a0promoted cell apoptosis and inhibited OXPHOS in H9c2 cells\u00a0through regulating glycolysis (Fig.\u00a06F), which may provide novel directions for new drug development.\nGlycolysis regulated energy metabolism22. Glucose is converted into pyruvate, NADH, and ATP by glycolysis23. Glycolysis involves in many biological and pathological processes.\u00a0For example, glycolysis promotes tumor growth24. Preclinical studies demonstrate that some small molecules such as 3-bromopyruvate suppresses cancer via targeting glycolysis25. Another study showed that Smad4 depletion in podocytes protects mice from glomerulosclerosis26. Inhibition of aerobic glycolysis causes depression of cardiac excitability and can lead to Ca2+ alternant in cardiac tissue27. Increased glycolysis is the earliest energy metabolic change during\u00a0heart failure with preserved ejection fraction28. Other studies have demonstrated that glycolysis affects sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) function and SR Ca2+ release not only through generation of ATP but also through direct interactions of\nFigure\u00a04.

Moreover, hyperglycemia enhances ipilimumab-induced cardiotoxicity through mechanisms mediated by MyD88 and NLRP3 signaling7, suggesting that targeting the MyD88/NLRP3 signaling may inhibit ipilimumab-induced cardiotoxicity in patients with cardiovascular diseases. In this study,\u00a0we demonstrated that suppressing glycolysis remarkably ameliorated the effect of\u00a0PFKM on DOX-mediated cell growth and apoptosis.\u00a0These results reveal a very important role of glycolysis in regulating\u00a0DOX-mediated cell growth and apoptosis and improve our knowledge of the role of glucose homeostasis in the reduction of doxorubicin cardiotoxicity.\nPFK catalyzes the rate-limiting phosphorylation of\u00a0fructose-6-phosphate and\u00a0sustains a high rate of\u00a0 glycolysis8. It has 3 isoforms: platelet (PFKP), muscle (PFKM), and liver (PFKL)29. PFKM\u00a0gene has 24 exons30. PFK deficiency belongs to glycogen storage disease\u00a0characterized by weakness with spasms and cramping on exercise30. Ristow et\u00a0al. have reported that deficiency of PFKM\u00a0results in insulin resistance, contributing to diabetes31. Studies also indicate that PFKM plays a very important role in cardiovascular diseases. For instance, Garcia et\u00a0al. indicated that PFK deficiency causes a cardiac and hematological disorder12. Two-month-old PFKM knockout mice developed cardiac hypertrophy and evident cardiomegaly with age12. Preclinical studies correlate high levels of IL-1\u03b2 to a greater risk of cardiovascular diseases; the underlying mechanism of cardiotoxicity involves the dysfunction of mitochondrial metabolism32. Therefore, pharmacological inhibition of IL-1\u03b2 could be a promising approach for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. In this study, PFKM downregulation also inhibited OXPHOS in H9c2 cells. However, the role of IL-1\u03b2 in PFKM-induced glucose and mitochondrial metabolism in DOX-treated H9c2 cells need further investigation. Our findings indicate a very important role of PFKM in regulating the proliferation of cardiomyoblasts and cardiotoxicity and improve our knowledge of FPKM in the pathogenesis of HF.\nProtein acetylation is the process that the acetyl group is transferred to a polypeptide chain33. Acetylation alters protein function33. Protein acetylation plays a very important role in diverse physiological processes34,35. H3K27ac involves in the higher activation of transcription36. It is elevated in mammary cancer and\u00a0administration of H3K27ac inhibitor repressed tumor formation37. Felice et\u00a0al. demonstrated that hypoacetylation of\u00a0H3K27\u00a0involves in intestinal inflammation38. H3K27ac also involves in cardiovascular diseases. For example, a study indicated that\u00a0H3K27ac acetylation status regulates phenotypic response in HF39. Papait et\u00a0al. reported that H3K27ac was decreased in mice with\u00a0transverse aortic constriction40. Our findings suggested that HDAC1 significantly decreased the level of H3K27ac to suppress the transcription of PFKM and regulate OXPHOS and glycolysis. These findings indicated the significance of HDAC1/H3K27ac/PFKM axis\u00a0in\u00a0cardiotoxicity and HF, which may benefit the study\u00a0of HF and cardiovascular diseases. Keep in mind that\u00a0only\u00a0in vitro cell experiments were used in this study. Future studies with animals or even clinical samples will definitely supply more meaningful data. Nevertheless, our study revealed new roles of PFKM and glycolysis\u00a0in HF.\nFigure\u00a05. HDAC1 inhibited H3K27ac-induced transcription of PFKM in DOX-induced H9c2 cells.

Fold change was calculated using 2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct formula.\nImmunoblotting. Cell lysates were extracted using radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (JRDUN Biotechnology, Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). Total protein concentration in each sample was measured using a Lowry protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA). Equivalent quantities (25\u00a0\u03bcg) of protein were separated by 10 or 15% sodium dodecyl sulfate\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Sigma-Aldrich), followed by blocking in fat-free milk overnight at 4\u02daC. The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies, including anti-PFKM antibody (ab154804, dilution 1:1000, Abcam), antiBcl-2 antibody (ab182858, dilution 1:2000, Abcam), anti-Bax antibody (ab32503, dilution 1:10,000, Abcam), anti-H3K27ac antibody (ab177178, dilution 1:10,000, Abcam), anti-HDAC1 antibody (10,197\u20131-AP, dilution 1:8000, Proteintech), and anti-beta actin antibody (66,009 \u2212 1-Ig, dilution 1:50,000, Proteintech) for overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. The membranes were then incubated for 1\u00a0h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C with anti-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG secondary antibodies (ZB-2305, ZB-2301, dilution 1:5000, ZSGB-BIO, Beijing, China). Chemiluminescence detection was conducted using Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) and signals were quantified by densitometry (Quantity One software, version 4.62; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.).\nChromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). ChIP analysis was performed as previously described43. Briefly, cells with 2\u00a0\u03bcM DOX treatment were cross-linked in 1% formaldehyde, and the DNA was sonicated into a size range of 200\u20131000 base pairs using a Bioruptor Sonicator (Diagenode) for five cycles of 3 son/3\u00a0s off. The extracts were pre-cleared in BSA-blocked protein A/G beads and incubated with antibody against H3K27ac (#8173, dilution 1:100, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc) or control IgG (#2729, dilution 1:100, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc) overnight at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. After being washed, the DNA was eluted and reverse-cross-linked overnight at 65\u00a0\u00b0C. Purified ChIP DNA was confirmed by Quantitative RT-PCR. PFKM primers sequences: 5\u2032-CAA CAC CAC CAC TAC CTT -3\u2032 (forward), 5\u2032-CAC TGC CAT CAA ACA AAC -3\u2032 (reverse).\n9 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2022) 12:11684 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-15743-0\nStatistical analysis.
