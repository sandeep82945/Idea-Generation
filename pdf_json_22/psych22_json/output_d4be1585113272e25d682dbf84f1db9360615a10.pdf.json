Efficient processing of graphs1 is the foundation of reading (Pelli et al., 2003), as graphs are the building blocks of written words from early on in reading acquisition to skillful reading (Grainger, 2018). How does the human brain become specialized and process graphs and written words in the context of themultimodal nature of the reading experience? This is the focus of this Research Topic. It includes a Research Topic of 13 articles that cover current issues in the cognition and neurobiology of reading development and variability. Groups with a wide range of reading skills took part in these studies, and various behavioral tests and neuroimaging techniques (EEG-ERPs, fMRI) were used to investigate how learning audio-visual and motor-visual associations relate to (in)efficient graph recognition and reading across alphabetic and logographic writing systems.\nThis Research Topic begins with two studies focusing on orthographic processing (i.e., encoding of information about letter identities and letter positions), a key interface between low-level visual processes and higher-level processing of words during reading (Grainger, 2018). Fern\u00e1ndez-L\u00f3pez et al. investigated the early precursors of precise letter position coding in pre-schoolers via the transposed-letter effect, i.e., failing to efficiently differentiate between CHOLOCATE and CHOCOLATE. Results highlighted\n1 We adopt the term \u201cgraph\u201d to refer to characters of a written script which code linguistic units as\nphonemes or syllables, such as letters or aksharas.\nFrontiers in Psychology 01 frontiersin.org\nthat learning to read is built also on a basic cognitive foundation, by showing that sequential memory and perception skills shape pre-readers\u2019 ability to encode letter position accurately (reflected in the size of the transposed-letter effect in a same-different task: TZ-ZT vs. TZ-TZ, previously reported in Perea et al., 2016). The importance of orthographic processing for reading development is also reflected in the longitudinal study by Eberhard-Moscicka et al. They investigated 1st-grade children with EEG and tested reading skills in the same children 3 years later. N1 print tuning, measured as an N1 increase in response to words compared to false-font strings, together with the mismatch negativity (MMN) improved the prediction of future reading skills compared to behavioral measures alone (RAN, vocabulary, and block design).\nThe second part of this Research Topic comprises six studies investigating letter-speech sound integration as an emergent property of learning to read. In a review article, Romanovska and Bonte offer a comprehensive picture of the brain basis of reading and a unifying framework with a developmental, dynamic skill learning perspective. They consider the shift from preliterate speech processing to the reading processes in the literate brain, and how dorsal spoken language and the ventral visual brain networks are gradually shaped, by the incremental development of phonological and orthographic knowledge, into an integrated audio-visual reading network. Karipidis et al. provided empirical longitudinal evidence of reading skill-dependent development, from pre-reading to the 1st and 2nd grades, in the functional activity of the superior temporal gyrus (STG), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and vOTC during audiovisual processing of single letter-speech sound correspondences.\nIn turn, four articles provided evidence regarding the audiovisual integration of single characters (in Latin alphabet and Chinese Calabrich et al.; Fraga-Gonz\u00e1lez et al.; Xia et al.) and of letter strings and spoken words (Varga et al.) by dyslexic readers. Specifically, Xia et al. provided evidence that the IFG and STG regions are also involved in the audiovisual processing of morpho-syllabic Chinese. While audiovisual integration effects in these regions did not differ between children with and without dyslexia for Chinese characters, a different correlational pattern of these effects with cognitive measures suggested that different neurocognitive networks shape the integration effects in children with and without dyslexia. Moreover, the same study also found a different audiovisual integration pattern for alphabetic pinyin compared to characters, which may reflect the specific role of pinyin as a scaffolding mechanism for learning Chinese characters. In an eye-tracking study, Calabrich et al. showed that adults with dyslexia recognized and recalled fewer newly learned letter-speech sound bindings than control readers. Dyslexics also showed an overreliance on (seemingly irrelevant) episodic cues during stimulus exposure to aid memory retrieval, specifically on the consistency of contextual stimulus properties, which \u201cmay be indicative of a more fragile memory representation\u201d (p. 12). Fraga-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. adopted a graph theoretical approach for assessing EEG\nactivity in dyslexic and typical readers during an artificial audiovisual learning task. Dyslexic were as able as control adults to accurately learn the novel bindings (i.e., no behavioral group difference), but showed lower theta connectivity during task performance and lower theta degree correlation over task and rest recordings, suggesting reduced (long distance) network integration and less communication between network nodes compared to typical readers. Finally, at the word level, using an implicit same-different perceptual-matching task, Varga et al. found that, whilst reading groups did not differ in ERP correlates of letter identity and letter position encoding in the visual modality, only typical adult readers but not those with dyslexia seemed to show automatic phonological processing and audiovisual integration when the visual letters and speech sounds were presented simultaneously (i.e., larger N1 responses to words than to pseudowords when orthographic stimuli were presented audiovisually).\nThe last part of this Research Topic focused on the other cross-modal binding promoted when learning to read, that is, between the visual representation of graphs and the corresponding writing gestures. It has been demonstrated that handwriting training during learning of visual graphs is more beneficial for subsequent visual graph recognition than are other learning experiences (e.g., viewing only, typewriting; for a recent meta-analysis, see Ara\u00fajo et al., 2022). In an opinion article, Fernandes and Ara\u00fajo reviewed and discussed the available evidence and the three theoretical proposals regarding the underlying mechanism(s) underpinning this handwriting benefit and proposed new directions to disentangle and investigate them. Seyll and Content provided empirical evidence in preschool children for the proposal that detailed visual analysis, which is inherent to handwriting, could be the key to the benefit of this learning experience in subsequent visual graph recognition rather than the graphic motor programs per se. Guan et al. showed that, relative to a view-only control training, the contribution of handwriting to visual word recognition also holds in a non-alphabetic script, both at behavioral and electrophysiological levels. Children with dyslexia did not benefit from such a multisensory graph integration. Note, however, that this conclusion might be premature, given that participants were engaged in handwriting for a few seconds and in a single exposure.\nVinci-Booher and James investigated the developmental trajectory of the neural system supporting handwriting, by contrasting fMRI, BOLD-signal change in children and adults during handwriting, and two sensorimotor control tasks. The results indicated that ventral-temporal involvement during handwriting may be adult-like by as early as 5\u20138 years of age, but a dorsal neural system including the more anterior parietal and frontal motor regions (related to the execution of the motor action) may still be developing in young children at the earliest stages of learning to read. A positive correlation further indicated that the response in these dorsal motor regions during\nFrontiers in Psychology 02 frontiersin.org\nhandwriting may be related to children\u2019s emerging literacy skills (i.e., letter-word identification).\nFinally, Fischer and Luxembourger addressed the challenge of mirror-image discrimination that beginners face when learning to read and write (e.g., b is different than d). These authors tested three candidate models for explaining the almost systematic reversal errors (e.g., b-d) found in writing by learners, using the data made publicly available by Torres et al. (2021). Given that none of these models convincingly accounted for this evidence, the authors suggest that reversal errors may result from a process of symmetrization, achieved through the homotopic interhemispheric exchange in the formation of memory circuits (Corballis, 2018) whichmay also be determined by the graphs themselves, specifically by the dynamics of writing letters.\nThis Research Topic provides an exciting overview of the importance of multi-systems interplay during reading development. This collection of papers illustrates the diversity of approaches in this research topic, from experimental psychology and cognitive and clinical neurosciences, adopting different paradigms, combining behavioral and neuroimaging tools, and testing different populations, such as beginning readers, typically-developing and dyslexic readers, alphabet and Chinese literate. It will also hopefully prompt and inspire new questions and directions in reading research in the context of the multimodal experience of reading which bridges visual, auditory, and motor brain systems."
