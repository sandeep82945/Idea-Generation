 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Further in vitro and in vivo studies on the inhibitory effects of ergocalciferol, cholecalciferol, ergosterol, and menaquinone on MCM7 activity and cancer cell proliferation. This could lead to development of these compounds as novel chemotherapeutic agents. 

2. Structure-activity relationship studies to design and synthesize analogs of the identified vitamin compounds with improved binding affinity and specificity towards MCM7.

3. Exploring the synergistic effects of combination therapy using the identified vitamin compounds along with existing chemotherapeutic drugs like cisplatin. 

4. Studies on the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of the identified vitamin compounds to determine optimal therapeutic dosages and delivery mechanisms.

5. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms by which the binding of the identified vitamin compounds to MCM7 alters its structure, dynamics and interactions with replication proteins like CDC45 and GINS. This can provide insights into their anticancer mode of action.
