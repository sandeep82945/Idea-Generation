Although such process implies an important suppression of the statistics, this is traded by clean signals from a \u201cquasi maximally entangled\u201d system, which makes it very promising to check these crucial phenomena at high energy. In this paper we devise a novel framework to extract from H \u2192 ZZ data all significant information related to this goal, in particular spin correlation observables. In this context we derive sufficient and necessary conditions for entanglement in terms of only two parameters. Likewise, we obtain a sufficient and improved condition for the violation of Bell-type inequalities.

For L 1\u20444 3 ab\u22121 (HL-LHC) entanglement can be probed beyond the 5\u03c3 level, while the sensitivity to a violation of the Bell inequalities is at the 4.5\u03c3 level.",

INTRODUCTION\nEntanglement is possibly the aspect of quantum mechanics that shows the greatest departure from classical conceptions [1]. Such departure is evidenced by the violation of Bell inequalities [2] by quantum mechanics, something unfeasible in any theory consistent with the classical notions of locality and realism. Let us recall here that entanglement is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the violation of the Bell inequalities. In consequence, it is highly relevant to test both phenomena at different scales, in particular at the highest possible energies [3,4]. This objective has recently been explored in several articles [5\u201310], on the top-antitop system (tt\u0304) at the LHC. On the other hand, a natural arena for these tests is provided by the Higgs boson decays in various channels. Certainly, the statistics is much smaller than for tt\u0304 production, but the physical system is much closer to a maximally entangled state. A first investigation in this sense was carried out in Ref. [11], considering the decay of the Higgs boson (H) into W\u00feW\u2212.\nIn this paper we will mainly focus on theH \u2192 ZZ decay, in particular when the two Z-bosons decay into light leptons. Admittedly, this amounts to an important suppression of the statistics, which is traded by clean signals from a \u201cquasi maximally entangled\u201d system. On the other hand, an important aspect in this kind of challenge is to devise a framework to easily extract fromH \u2192 ZZ data all significant information related to entanglement and the violation of Bell inequalities, in particular the 80 spin and spin correlation observables. Then we study necessary and sufficient conditions for entanglement and violation of Bell inequalities in terms of observable quantities and analyze the feasibility of these checks by using actual experimental data. This represents the main goal of the paper. In Sec. II we review the definition and conditions for quantum entanglement and Bell inequalities, focusing on a system with two dimension-3 subsystems. In Sec. III we formulate the spin density matrix \u03c1 associated to the ZZ system that arises from Higgs decays. We describe there the constraints on \u03c1 from symmetry considerations and express the matrix in an appropriate basis for Hermitian operators, with coefficients that can be determined from experimental data. In Sec. IV we give sufficient and necessary conditions for entanglement in the \u03c1 matrix, expressing them in terms of the above coefficients. In Sec. V we perform a similar task for the conditions for the violation of Bell inequalities, introducing also a new Bell operator which is a more powerful indicator of that violation than other proposals in the literature. In Sec. VI we investigate the statistical sensitivity of future experimental measurements to the above described entanglement and violation of Bell inequalities. We will show that there are good prospects *ja.a.s@csic.es \u2020alexander.bernal@csic.es \u2021j.alberto.casas@gmail.com \u00a7jesus.moreno@csic.es Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

            "text": "By definition, a state of two subsystems (Alice and Bob) is entangled if it is not separable, i.e., if its density matrix cannot be expressed as\n\u03c1sep \u00bc X n pn\u03c1An \u2297 \u03c1Bn ; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere pn > 0 are classical probabilities, with P\npn \u00bc 1, and \u03c1An ; \u03c1Bn are density matrices acting in the Alice and Bob Hilbert spaces. A general test for a density matrix to determine whether it corresponds to a separable or an entangled state is not known. The most popular one is the Peres-Horodecki criterion [12,13], which provides a sufficient condition for entanglement: denoting jii, j\u03bci two orthonormal bases of the HA, HB Hilbert spaces, and \u03c1i\u03bc;j\u03bd\nthe density matrix of the global system, then a newmatrix is constructed by transposing only the indices of Bob (or Alice),\n\u03c1T2 \u00bc \u03c1i\u03bd;j\u03bc: \u00f02\u00de\nIf \u03c1T2 has at least one negative eigenvalue, then the \u03c1 matrix describes an entangled state. This sufficient condition is also necessary in two general cases: dimHA \u00bc dimHB \u00bc 2 (qubits) and dimHA \u00bc 2, dimHB \u00bc 3 (and vice-versa), but not for dimHA \u00bc dimHB \u00bc 3 (qutrits) or larger. This is the case of the spin states of the massive vector bosons. However, as we will see soon, for the ZZ system stemming from a Higgs decay, the Peres-Horodecki is a necessary condition as well. Concerning the Bell inequalities, for subsystems of dimension 3, as the case at hand, several Bell-like relations have been explored. Typically, when the system is not very far from a maximally entangled state the popular CHSH inequality [14], which is optimal for qubits, does not provide the maximal departure from local realism predictions [15]. A much more powerful relation is given by the so-called CGLMP inequality [15]. Namely, if A1, A2 and B1, B2 are observables inHA,HB that take (or are assigned to take) three possible values, 1, 0 then the following inequality should hold in any local-realistic theory\nI3 \u00bc P\u00f0A1 \u00bc B1\u00de \u00fe P\u00f0B1 \u00bc A2 \u00fe 1\u00de \u00fe P\u00f0A2 \u00bc B2\u00de \u00fe P\u00f0B2 \u00bc A1\u00de \u2212 \u00bdP\u00f0A1 \u00bc B1 \u2212 1\u00de \u00fe P\u00f0B1 \u00bc A2\u00de \u00fe P\u00f0A2 \u00bc B2 \u2212 1\u00de \u00fe P\u00f0B2 \u00bc A1 \u2212 1\u00de \u2264 2; \u00f03\u00de\nwhere P\u00f0Bi \u00bc Aj \u00fe a\u00de denotes the probability that the measurement of the observable Bi gives the same result as the one of Aj plus a (mod. 3). In quantum mechanics the above probabilities are expressed in terms of expectation values of the appropriate projectors; e.g., P\u00f0A1 \u00bc 0\u00de \u00bc hP0A1i \u00bc Trf\u03c1P0A1 \u2297 13g, where P0A1 is the projector associated to the eigenvalue 0 of A1. Consequently, the value of I3 can be expressed as the expectation value of a certain operator, I3 \u00bc hOBelli, and the CGLMP inequality reads\nI3 \u00bc hOBelli \u00bc Trf\u03c1OBellg \u2264 2: \u00f04\u00de\nThe general expression of the \u201cBell operator\u201d OBell, in terms of the four chosen observables, A1, A2, B1, B2, is given in detail in the Appendix. Of course, in order to optimize the violation of the CGLMP-inequality (4) in quantum mechanics, a smart choice of the A1, A2, B1, B2 has to be made depending on the state \u03c1 at hand. This issue will be examined in detail in Sec. V below."

            "text": "The general spin state of the ZZ system is described by a density operator, \u03c1, acting on the (dim 9) Hilbert space defined by the three spin states of each Z. It is important to note that the propagator of the off-shell Z boson also has a scalar component, whose contribution cancels when coupled to massless final state fermions, as is our case; therefore, we can safely consider the off-shell Z boson as a spin-1 particle too [16]. We will work in the conventional basis of eigenstates of the third component of the spin for each boson, j\u00fei; j0i; j\u2212i, and in the center of mass (CM) reference system, defining the z-axis along the 3-momentum, k\u20d7, of one of the Z\u2019s. Furthermore, to avoid ambiguities, we will choose the latter as the Z-boson with the largest invariant mass, which is always well defined in theH \u2192 ZZ process. Note that with this choice of reference system, the sign of third component of spin coincides with the helicity for one of the bosons (and minus the helicity for the other).\n016012-2\nIt is interesting to discuss how far one can go to in determining the texture of the \u03c1 matrix, just based on the symmetries of the system. First of all, since in this case the two Z bosons arise from the Higgs decay, the spin component along the momentum direction, i.e., Jz, is conserved and vanishing for the joint system. This means that only the 9 entries of the \u03c1 operator corresponding to huij\u03c1juji, with ju1i \u00bc j \u00fe \u2212i; ju2i \u00bc j00i; ju3i \u00bc j \u2212\u00fei, can be different from zero. In general, the \u03c1 operator will be a convex combination \u03c1 \u00bc X pljlihlj; with pl \u2265 0; X\npl \u00bc 1 \u00f05\u00de and jli\u00bc \u03b11j\u00fe\u2212i\u00fe\u03b12j00i\u00fe\u03b13j\u2212\u00fei; with X\ni\u00bc1;2;3 j\u03b1ij2\u00bc 1:\n\u00f06\u00de Since in the H \u2192 ZZ process parity is conserved, for a particular event the ZZ state must be necessarily of the form\nj\u03c8ZZi \u00bc 1ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 2\u00fe \u03b22 p \u00f0j \u00fe \u2212i \u2212 \u03b2j00i \u00fe j \u2212\u00fei\u00de; \u00f07\u00de\nwith \u03b2 real. Note that the \u03b11 \u00bc \u03b13 \u00bc 0 case in (6) is recovered for j\u03b2j \u2192 \u221e. In its rest frame the decay of the Higgs boson obviously has spherical symmetry, so the value of \u03b2 just depends on the nontrivial kinematical variables, namely the two invariant masses of the vector bosons, mZ1 ; mZ2 , and the modulus of the corresponding 3-momentum jk\u20d7j, which is related to the former byffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi jk\u20d7j2 \u00fem2Z1 q \u00fe ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi jk\u20d7j2 \u00fem2Z2 q \u00bc mH. We can get an accurate expression for \u03b2 using the Lorentz structure of the interaction term \u221d \u03b7\u03bc\u03bdHZ\u03bcZ\u03bd in the SM. Then the scalar state of the ZZ system in the CM frame is given by [17]\nj\u03c8ZZi \u00bc \u03b7\u03bc\u03bde\u03bc\u03c3\u00f0mZ1 ; k\u20d7\u00dee\u03bd\u03bb\u00f0mZ2 ;\u2212k\u20d7\u00dejk\u20d7; \u03c3iAj\u2212k\u20d7; \u03bbiB; \u00f08\u00de where \u03c3, \u03bb represent spin states and\ne\u03bc\u03c3\u00f0m; k\u20d7\u00de \u00bc 0 BBBBB@ 0 jk\u20d7j m 0 \u2212 1ffiffi 2 p 0 1ffiffi 2 p iffiffi 2 p 0 iffiffi 2 p\n0 \u2212 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi jk\u20d7j2\u00fem2 p m 0\n1 CCCCCA : \u00f09\u00de\nComparing Eqs.

(10) we see that \u03b2 \u2265 1, with \u03b2 \u00bc 1\ncorresponding to the decay into two at-rest Z\u2019s. In the latter case the spin-state of the ZZ system is the singlet one, which is maximally entangled, see Eq. (7). Likewise, as mZ2 decreases, and so jk\u20d7j approaches its maximal value, the state goes to j00i. In consequence, the larger the mass of the off-shell Z, the larger the entanglement and the opportunities to experimentally show both entanglement and violation of Bell inequalities. For a given value of \u03b2 the final spin state is pure and the \u03c1 matrix, say \u03c1\u03b2, is completely determined. However, when one gathers data from different kinematical configurations, the state becomes a mixture\n\u03c1 \u00bc Z d\u03b2P\u00f0\u03b2\u00de\u03c1\u03b2: \u00f011\u00de\nOnce the probability P\u00f0\u03b2\u00de is known, the final \u03c1 becomes also well determined. Figure 1 shows P\u00f0\u03b2\u00de when no cuts are imposed on the kinematical variables. In general, the form of P\u00f0\u03b2\u00de depends on the possible cuts in the kinematical variables. Still, due to the symmetric form of the possible final states, Eq. (7), the density matrix has a well defined structure, namely\n\u03c1 \u00bc 1 2\u00few2 0 BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB@ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 \u2212y 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2212y 0 w2 0 \u2212y 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 \u2212y 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCA \u00f012\u00de\n016012-3\nwith y real. When one only considers final states with the same mZ1 , and mZ2 and thus the same \u03b2, the spin state is pure and the density matrix, \u03c1\u03b2 has the form (12) with w \u00bc y \u00bc \u03b2. Otherwise w and y are averages over the kinematical variables, as expressed in Eq. (11). Of course, when the \u03c1 matrix is extracted from experimental data, it does not present the exact form (12) due to systematic and statistical errors, and the existence of (small) background."

The optimal choice, i.e., the one that leads to a larger violation of the inequality, depends on the state at hand (in our case the density operator, \u03c1). This issue was considered in Ref. [15] in a more abstract context. Namely, denoting by jiiA, jjiB (i; j \u00bc 1; 2; 3) two orthonormal bases of HA, HB, if the state at hand is the maximally entangled state of the form\nj\u03c8 0i \u00bc 1ffiffiffi 3 p \u00f0j11i \u00fe j22i \u00fe j33i\u00de; \u00f031\u00de\nwhere jiji \u00bc jiiAjjiB, then a particular choice of the four observables A1, A2, B1, B2 was argued to maximize the violation of the CGLMP inequality.

Note that in this limit all the choices of U give equivalent results for the violation of the CGLMP inequality,\nI3 \u00bc Trf\u03c1OBellg > 2: \u00f038\u00de\nOf course, in general \u03b2 \u2260 1, so the spin state j\u03c8ZZi (7) is not a singlet and not all choices of U are equivalent. Thus, one should in principle explore all the possible Bell operators in order to find the optimal one. This represents a huge parameter space. However, since \u03b2 is typically not far from 1, see Fig. 1, a reasonable strategy is to consider Bell operators of the form (37), exploring the space ofU-matrices. This exploration is greatly simplified by noting that the j\u03c8ZZi state (7) is still invariant under transformations UOA \u2297 U , where U is a unitary matrix acting only in the subspace spanned by fj\u00fei; j\u2212ig, as well as under a redefinition via a global phase. Hence, the nonequivalent choices of U are those belonging to the U\u00f03\u00de= \u00f0U\u00f02\u00de \u2297 U\u00f01\u00de\u00de coset. For each one of them we get a different OBell operator (37) and a prediction for I3 \u00bc hOBelli, say I3\u00f0\u03b2; U\u00de. We have explored the form of U that maximizes I3\u00f0\u03b2; U\u00de and found that, in the region of\ninterest, a choice that is nearly optimal for all values of \u03b2 is given by:\nU0 \u00bc 0 BB@ 1 2\n\u2212 1ffiffi 2 p 1 2\n\u2212 1ffiffi 2 p 0 1ffiffi 2 p\n1 2\n1ffiffi 2 p 1 2\n1 CCA: \u00f039\u00de\nThis is illustrated in Fig. 2, where we compare the performance of the simplest choice, U \u00bc 1, with that of U \u00bc U0.

Notice that the A12;0 parameter is related to C2;2;2;\u22122 by Eq. (27). However, we will keep it as an independent parameter when extracting its value from data, as a possible handle to estimate the involved uncertainties.1 This may not be convenient, however, in the presence of systematic uncertainties, but such a study is beyond the scope of the present work."

            "text": "We investigate now the statistical sensitivity of future experimental measurements to the above described entanglement and violation of Bell inequalities. For this goal we generate pp \u2192 H \u2192 ZZ \u2192 4l using MadGraph [21], with on-shell H. The gg \u2192 H one-loop process is implemented by a contact interaction, but otherwise the Monte Carlo calculation is performed at the leading order. On the other hand, for the calculation of the expected number of events we use state-of-the art values of the Higgs production cross section and branching ratio into four electrons or muons. The cross section at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order is 48.61 pb at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV [22], and the Higgs branching ratio decay into four leptons (electrons or muons) is 1.24 \u00d7 10\u22124 [22]. Overall, the cross section times branching ratio for the final state considered is 6.02 fb at 13 TeV. We implement our analysis using the e\u00fee\u2212\u03bc\u00fe\u03bc\u2212 final state for simplicity, but note that in final states with four electrons or four muons the two Z bosons can still be cleanly identified, since one is nearly on-shell and gives two leptons with invariant mass close to mZ, while the remaining two leptons have a much lower invariant mass. The (very close to real) Z boson with largest invariant mass is labeled as Z1, and its four-momentum reconstructed from its decay products l\u00fe1 l \u2212 1 . The off-shell Z boson is labeled as Z2, and its momentum is determined summing up the momenta of its decay products l\u00fe2 l \u2212 2 .\nThe reference system used to determine spin observables has a construction similar to the helicity basis used for top pair production [23], and is defined as follows:\n(i) The z\u0302 axis is taken in the direction of the Z1 threemomentum in the Higgs boson rest frame.\n(ii) The x\u0302 axis is in the production plane and defined as x\u0302 \u00bc sign\u00f0cos \u03b8\u00de\u00f0p\u0302p \u2212 cos \u03b8z\u0302\u00de= sin \u03b8, with p\u0302p \u00bc \u00f00; 0; 1\u00de the direction of one proton in the laboratory frame, cos \u03b8 \u00bc z\u0302 \u00b7 p\u0302p. The definition for x\u0302 is the same if we use the direction of the other proton \u2212p\u0302p.\n(iii) The y\u0302 axis is taken such that y\u0302 \u00bc z\u0302 \u00d7 x\u0302, orthogonal to the production plane. The angles \u00f0\u03b81;\u03c61\u00de in the differential distribution (23) are the polar coordinates of the three-momentum of the\nnegative charged lepton l\u22121 from the Z1 decay, in the Z1 rest frame. Likewise, the angles \u00f0\u03b82;\u03c62\u00de correspond to the three-momentum of l\u22122 in the Z2 rest frame. As mentioned in Sec. III B, the coefficients of the expansion of the ZZ density operator (17) are obtained by integration with spherical harmonics, cf. (25). We estimate the potential of future measurements by calculating the statistical uncertainty of the relevant observables for entanglement and Bell inequality violation, see Eqs. (30) and (42). For the LHC Runs 2\u00fe 3 and the HLLHC the luminosities assumed are of 300 fb\u22121 and 3 ab\u22121, respectively. For simplicity, a CM energy of 13 TeV is used in all cases; note however that the cross section for gg \u2192 H increases to 54.7 pb at 14 TeV. In order to have a more realistic estimate of the number of events in each case a lepton detection efficiency of 0.7 is assumed, yielding an overall detection efficiency of 0.25.2\nThe statistical uncertainty in the observables is determined by performing 1000 pseudoexperiments. In each one, we select a random set of N events, with a size corresponding to the assumed luminosity, and calculate the observables from the differential distribution, as aforementioned. Repeating this procedure, we obtain the mean and standard deviation for each observable. The mean value resulting from the pseudoexperiments is quite close to the theoretical value calculated with the full Monte Carlo sample, and the standard deviation corresponds to the expected statistical uncertainty. Systematic uncertainties are not included in our analysis. Given the clean final state and the good experimental resolution for charged leptons, these uncertainties are expected to be small. In any case, they must be addressed within an experimental analysis using a full detector simulation. As discussed in Sec. III A, the larger the mass mZ2 of the off-shell Z boson, the more entangled the ZZ state is. However, requiring a lower cut on mZ2 also decreases the statistics, increasing the uncertainty in the measurements. We give results without any cut and also with lower cuts mZ2 \u2265 10, 20, 30 GeV. Table I gives the results for L \u00bc 300 fb\u22121. The entanglement can be probed at the 3\u03c3 level using C2;1;2;\u22121, and below the 2\u03c3 level using C2;2;2;\u22122, see Eq. (30). A combination of both observables, which is beyond the scope of this work, would improve the sensitivity. On the other hand, the sensitivity to the violation of the Bell inequalities, see Eq. (42), is below the 2\u03c3 level. Table II gives the results for L \u00bc 3 ab\u22121. In this case, the entanglement can be probed beyond the 5\u03c3 level using both\n1Actually, in this way the statistical uncertainty in I3 becomes 5% smaller in the simulations discussed in Sec.

            "text": "In this paper we have studied the quantum properties of the ZZ pair produced in the Higgs boson decay, focusing on entanglement and violation of Bell inequalities. Because the Higgs boson is a scalar and mZ is not far from mH, the ZZ pair is produced nearly in a spin-singlet state, where the quantum entanglement is maximal, and turns the study of its quantum properties quite interesting. The spin state of a ZZ pair, and the joint decay angular distribution, are parametrized by 80 (polarization and spin correlation) observables. We have introduced a novel, compact parametrization that makes the description strikingly simple. For the specific case of H \u2192 ZZ, angular momentum, and P and CP conservation, greatly reduce the number of parameters to only two independent parameters, namely the spin correlation coefficients C2;1;2;\u22121 and C2;2;2;\u22122, see Eq. (26). In terms of these parameters we have first formulated the conditions for quantum entanglement of the ZZ pair. There are two sufficient Peres-Horodecki conditions for entanglement, namely that any of the coefficients, C2;1;2;\u22121 or C2;2;2;\u22122, is different from zero. We have shown that, due to the underlying symmetry of the process, these are also necessary conditions, which represents a noteworthy exception to the general situation for the Peres-Horodecki criterion. Second, we have found a Bell operator which is amuchmore powerful indicator of the violation of Bell inequalities than\nother proposals in the literature when ZZ is not exactly in a spin-singlet state (as it is the actual case). Finally, we have investigated the experimental prospects to measure the entanglement and violation of Bell inequalities, focusing on the gluon-fusion process gg \u2192 H \u2192 ZZ \u2192 4l at the LHC. Our study has been performed at the parton level, without a detector simulation and without considering the background. Concerning the former, we do not expect a great impact of the detector resolution, which is quite good for charged leptons at the ATLAS and CMS detectors. By the same token, systematic uncertainties are expected to be small. The experimental precision is then expected to be dominated by the available statistics: the decay H \u2192 4l has a branching ratio of only 1.24 \u00d7 10\u22124. Regarding the backgrounds, theH \u2192 ZZ \u2192 4l signal is quite clean, its main background being the electroweak process pp \u2192 ZZ=Z\u03b3 \u2192 4lwhich is about 4 times smaller at the Higgs peak [25] Yet, a background subtraction will be necessary before computing the entanglement observables. This non-negligible background will slightly increase the statistical uncertainty of the measurement. Another issue to be taken into account is the fact that in four-electron and four-muon final states, LO interference diagrams from the interchange of identical particles give non-negligible contributions that are up to order 10% in some distributions [26]. These contributions may be reduced when a kinematical cut on the on-shell Z mass is imposed, for example, and do not invalidate the interpretation of the measurements as corresponding to entanglement or violation of Bell inequalities. The decay H \u2192 WW \u2192 l\u03bdl\u03bd considered in [11] shares quite the same properties of H \u2192 ZZ and enjoys higher\nMin mZ2\n0 10 GeV 20 GeV 30 GeV\nN 4500 4180 3120 1290 C2;1;2;\u22121 \u22120.95 0.10 \u22121.00 0.10 \u22121.04 0.12 \u22121.04 0.19 C2;2;2;\u22122 0.60 0.12 0.64 0.12 0.74 0.14 0.83 0.20 I3 2.63 0.15 2.71 0.16 2.81 0.18 2.84 0.28\n016012-9\nstatistics; however, on the other hand, a unique kinematical reconstruction of the final state is not possible due to the two unobserved neutrinos. With these caveats in mind, there are good prospects for the measurements at the LHC. With the Run 2\u00fe 3 combined luminosities, the quantum entanglement might be measured at the 3\u03c3 level. At the HL-LHC, the significance would be well above 5\u03c3, and the violation of Bell inequalities would be probed at the 4.5\u03c3 level."

The Aa and Bb observables can be defined by their respective normalized eigenstates, jkiAa and jliBb , which can in turn be specified by their components in certain bases (computational bases), say fj\u03b1iAg and fj\u03b2iBg, with \u03b1; \u03b2 \u00bc 1;\u2026; d. Those components can be arranged as the columns of four unitary matrices, UAa , UBb . Thus, specifying the unitary matrices \u00f0UAa; UBb\u00de is equivalent to give the Hermitian operators \u00f0Aa; Bb\u00de.
