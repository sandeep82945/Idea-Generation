Polymeric nanoparticles are one method to modify the drug release of small hydrophilic molecules. In this study, clindamycin HCl was used as a model drug loaded in carboxymethyl chitosan nanoparticles cross-linked with Ca2+ ions (CMCS-Ca2+). The ultrasonication with experimental design was used to produce CMCS-Ca2+ nanoparticles loading clindamycin HCl. The model showed that the size of nanoparticles decreased when amplitude and time increased. The nanoparticle size of 318.40 ± 7.56 nm, decreased significantly from 543.63 ± 55.07 nm (p < 0.05), was obtained from 75% of amplitude and 180 s of time, which was one of the optimal conditions. The clindamycin loading content in this condition was 34.68 ± 2.54%. The drug content in nanoparticles showed an inverse relationship with the size of the nanoparticles. The sodium carboxymethylcellulose film loading clindamycin HCl nanoparticles exhibited extended release with 69.88 ± 2.03% drug release at 60 min and a gradual increase to 94.99 ± 4.70% at 24 h, and demonstrated good antibacterial activity against S. aureus and C. acne with 40.72 ± 1.23 and 48.70 ± 1.99 mm of the zone of inhibition at 24 h, respectively. Thus, CMCS-Ca2+ nanoparticles produced by the ultrasound-assisted technique could be a potential delivery system to modify the drug release of small hydrophilic antibiotics. 1. conclusions CMCS nanoparticles loading clindamycin HCL as the model drug of water-soluble antibiotics were prepared by ionic interaction with Ca2+ with the ultrasound-assisted technique. The effect of intensity (amplitude) and duration (time) on the mean diameter of nanoparticles was i vestigated by experimental design. The model had the potential to predict the mean diameter of the produc d nanoparticles. The study found that the siz of the nanoparticles tended to decrease when amplitude and time i creased. The obtained condition from the exp rimental d sign to obtain around 318 nm of nanoparticle size was 75% of amplitude a d 180 s of time. The FTIR spectra showed that the p aks of carboxylic groups of CMCS in CMCS-Ca2+ nanoparticl shifted, and their intensity decrea ed. These dicated an interaction b tween the carboxylic groups of CMCS and Ca2+ to form polymeric nanoparticl s. The TEM imaging showed that the CMCS-Ca2+ nanoparticles were in a spherical shape without aggregation. The clind mycin HCl load d in a CMCS-Ca2+ nanoparticle was loaded into the SCMC film and exhibited 93.80 ± 9.24% of clindamycin HCl conten . The drug release profile showed that the SCMC-CM- ano film performe an extended rel ase pattern, compared with the release of clindamycin HCl powd r loaded i SCMC film, w ic exhibited an immediate drug release pattern. Although the extended-release of SCMC-CM-nano film induced a slightly lower zo e of inhibition against S. aureus at 6, 9, and 12 h, the SCMC-CM-nano film demonstrated good antibacterial activity against S. aureus and C. acne with 40.72 ± 1.23 and 48.70 ± 1.99 mm of the zone of inhibition at 24 h. These values were not significantly different from the clindamycin solution and SCMC-CM-powder film. Thus, this study indicated that CMCSCa2+ nanoparticles prepared by the ultrasound-assisted technique could be a potential carrier to modify the drug release of a small hydrophilic antibacterial molecule.
