    "abstractText": "Melanoma is one of the deadliest forms of cancer. Most melanoma deaths are caused by distant metastases in several organs, especially the brain, the so-called melanoma brain metastases (MBMs). However, the precise mechanisms that sustain the growth of MBMs remain elusive. Recently, the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate has been proposed as a brain-specific, pro-tumorigenic signal for various types of cancers, but how neuronal glutamate shuttling onto metastases is regulated remains unknown. Here, we show that the cannabinoid CB1 receptor (CB1R), a master regulator of glutamate output from nerve terminals, controls MBM proliferation. First, in silico transcriptomic analysis of cancer-genome atlases indicated an aberrant expression of glutamate receptors in human metastatic melanoma samples. Second, in vitro experiments conducted on three different melanoma cell lines showed that the selective blockade of glutamatergic NMDA receptors, but not AMPA or metabotropic receptors, reduces cell proliferation. Third, in vivo grafting of melanoma cells in the brain of mice selectively devoid of CB1Rs in glutamatergic neurons increased tumour cell proliferation in concert with NMDA receptor activation, whereas melanoma cell growth in other tissue locations Cancers 2023, 15, 2439. https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers15092439 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/cancers Cancers 2023, 15, 2439 2 of 19 was not affected. Taken together, our findings demonstrate an unprecedented regulatory role of neuronal CB1Rs in the MBM tumour microenvironment.",

The advent of novel clinical options for melanoma treatment, such as BRAFV600E, MEK, and immune-checkpoint inhibitors, have greatly contributed to reduce the mortality rate of patients, especially those with advanced unresectable or metastatic melanoma, that nowadays experience long-term disease control [3,4]. Despite these milestone achievements, almost half of these individuals eventually develop melanoma brain metastases (MBMs), a process that causes the death of 60\u201370% of melanoma patients [3]. Thus, melanoma is a cancer type of leading morbidity and mortality when it comes to brain metastasis [5,6], due, in part, to the limited therapeutical options for its management [7,8], which results in an extremely low survival rate (less than 10% of patients surpassing 3 years). Thus, identifying molecular mechanisms that influence MBM remains an open question of utmost importance to unveil new potential therapeutic targets for this devastating disease. The endocannabinoid system (ECS; Scheme 1) is a widely spread intercellular communication system highly expressed in the brain. It comprises two G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), namely type-1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1R) and type-2 cannabinoid receptor (CB2R); their endogenous ligands (so-called \u201cendocannabinoids\u201d), namely the eicosanoid lipids N-arachidonoylethanolamine (anandamide, AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2- AG); and the enzymes involved in endocannabinoid synthesis (mostly N-acyl-phosphatidyl ethanolamine phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD) for AEA, and diacylglycerol lipase \u03b1/\u03b2 (DAGL\u03b1/\u03b2) for 2-AG) and degradation (mostly fatty acid amide hydrolase

Note that CB2R is not included in the scheme because its expression is essentially restricted to microglial cells.\nCancers 2023, 15, 2439 3 of 19\nSubstantial preclinical research conducted on mouse models has implicated the ECS in the control of the growth and spreading of many types of cancer cells, including, among others, glioblastoma, lung carcinoma, skin carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, breast carcinoma, prostate carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, colorectal carcinoma, head and neck carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, thyroid epithelioma, rhabdomyosarcoma, lymphoma, and, most relevant to the present study, melanoma cells [10\u201312]. Nonetheless, the great majority of these studies have aimed to pharmacologically manipulate the ECS expressed by the tumour cell, letting aside the ECS in non-tumour cells, thus neglecting a likely important site of physio-pathological action of this system. Of note, CB1R is one of the most abundant GPCRs in the mouse and human brain, whereas CB2R is scarcely expressed in this organ, being largely restricted to microglial cells [13,14]. The best-established neurobiological action of CB1R is the retrograde inhibition of synaptic activity by reducing presynaptic neurotransmitter release. This occurs in numerous neuronal populations, including (inhibitory) GABAergic neurons and (excitatory) glutamatergic neurons, thereby making CB1R a key homeostatic signalling platform for brain function [15]. Recent evidence highlights the importance of brain-residing cells for the formation, development, and progression of brain metastases from several types of cancer [16]. Specifically, MBM cells, through secretion of amyloid beta, induce an anti-inflammatory, prometastatic phenotype in astrocytes [17,18], and other cancer cells, such as those from breast and lung carcinomas, utilise gap-junctions to enforce astrocytes into secreting protumorigenic signals [19]. Less is known about the role of neurons in the metastatic-cell microenvironment. Recently, it was found that metastatic breast cancer cells establish synapse-like contacts with neurons to co-opt neuron-secreted glutamate. This glutamate engages N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) on the target cancer cell, thereby fuelling an NMDAR-driven oncogenic signalling axis that ensures tumour growth [20]. A similar process occurs in glioma cells, where glutamatergic neuronal activity promotes their proliferation [21\u201323]. However, the mechanisms that govern the output of pro-tumorigenic glutamate from neurons to cancer cells, including MBM cells, are currently unknown. Here, upon analysing in silico the expression changes of ECS elements from primary melanoma to metastatic melanoma samples, we noticed that profound changes in the expression profile of glutamate receptors occur as well. This prompted us to conduct mechanistic studies on melanoma cells in vitro, which revealed that NMDARs drive melanoma cell proliferation, suggesting that glutamate could boost MBM spreading. As it is well established that CB1Rs inhibit glutamate secretion from nerve terminals, we carried out various melanoma cell-based allografting approaches in genetically engineered, immunocompetent mice devoid of CB1Rs selectively in either glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons. These experiments showed that CB1Rs located on glutamatergic neurons, but not on GABAergic neurons, play an important role in restraining MBM cell growth in vivo. In sum, this study unveils an unprecedented molecular mechanism to explain how glutamate release from neurons is controlled to sustain brain cancer cell growth."

            "text": "The expression of ECS elements is dysregulated in multiple forms of cancer, including melanoma [29,30]. To assess if the ECS influences the development of melanoma metastases, we interrogated the GDC-TCGA skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) transcriptomic dataset for the expression of the most characteristic ECS elements in primary tumour vs. metastatic biopsies using the Xena\u00ae tool [24]. CB1R (encoded by CNR1) and mostly CB2R (CNR2), as well as DAGL\u03b1 (DAGLA), were upregulated in metastatic samples, whereas DAGL\u03b2 (DAGLB), FAAH (FAAH), and alpha/beta-hydrolase domain-containing 6 and 12 (ABHD6 and ABHD12)-two alternative enzymes for 2-AG inactivation- were downregulated (Figure 1). All other ECS members analysed remained unaltered (Figure 1). In full caption, these changes, although modest in magnitude, would point to an elevated 2-AG/AEA tone in metastatic melanoma owing to an increased 2-AG production (upregulation of DAGL\u03b1) and a reduced 2-AG/AEA bioconversion (downregulation of ABHD6/12 and FAAH, respectively), in concert with an elevated availability of the two bona fide 2-AG/AEA molecular targets, i.e., CB1R and CB2R. Of note, endocannabinoid production in the brain occurs upon Ca2+ mobilization by Gq/11 protein-coupled GPCRs, especially metabotropic glutamate receptors 1 and 5 (mGluR1/5) [9]. In addition, an aberrant glutamatergic signalling has been previously found in melanoma [31,32] and other types of cancer [33,34]. Hence, we next analysed the status of glutamate receptors. The expression of mGluR1 (GRM1) and mGluR5 (GRM5) was conserved from primary tumours to metastatic samples, but moderate changes were evident for other receptors such as mGluR2/3/7/8 (GRM2, GRM3, GRM7, and GRM8) (Figure 2A). Regarding the subunits forming ionotropic glutamate receptors, namely N-methyl-Daspartate receptors (NMDARs) and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs), expression changes were also evident between primary and metastatic samples (Figure 2B,C). Noteworthy, among NMDAR subunits, an upregulation of NMDAR2B (GRIN2B) in metastases was the most pronounced change (Figure 2B), whereas the overexpression of GLUR2 (GRIA2) could be highlighted for AMPAR subunits (Figure 2C). Changes were also noticeable for PSD-95 (DLG4), but not for GKAP (DLGAP1) or BDNF (BDNF), three proteins downstream of NMDARs (Figure 2D) [20]. Taken together, these transcriptomic analyses unveil a dysregulation (conceivably an overactivation) of glutamatoceptive signalling in metastatic melanoma compared to primary melanoma.\nCancers 2023, 15, 2439 9 of 19Cancers\u00a02023,\u00a015,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 9\u00a0 of\u00a0 21\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Figure\u00a01.\u00a0mRNA\u00a0levels\u00a0of\u00a0ECS\u00a0elements\u00a0in\u00a0human\u00a0primary\u00a0and\u00a0metastatic\u00a0melanoma.\u00a0The\u00a0transcript\u00a0 expression\u00a0of\u00a0CNR1\u00a0(CB1R),\u00a0CNR2\u00a0(CB2R),\u00a0DAGLA\u00a0(DAGL-\u03b1),\u00a0DAGLB\u00a0(DAGL-\u03b2),\u00a0FAAH\u00a0(FAAH),\u00a0 MGLL\u00a0 (MAGL),\u00a0 NAPEPLD\u00a0 (NAPE-PLD),\u00a0 ABHD4\u00a0 (ABHD4),\u00a0 ABHD6\u00a0 (ABHD6),\u00a0 and\u00a0 ABHD12\u00a0 (ABHD12)\u00a0(in\u00a0FPKM)\u00a0was\u00a0compared\u00a0between\u00a0primary\u00a0tumours\u00a0and\u00a0metastatic\u00a0samples\u00a0from\u00a0melanoma\u00a0patients\u00a0by\u00a0unpaired\u00a0Student\u2019s\u00a0t\u00a0test\u00a0with\u00a0Welch\u2019s\u00a0correction.\u00a0Data\u00a0were\u00a0obtained\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0 GDC-TCGA\u00a0SKCM\u00a0data\u00a0set\u00a0using\u00a0Xena\u00a0and\u00a0comprised\u00a0103\u00a0primary\u00a0tumour\u00a0samples\u00a0and\u00a0367\u00a0metastatic\u00a0samples.\u00a0\nOf\u00a0note,\u00a0endocannabinoid\u00a0production\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0brain\u00a0occurs\u00a0upon\u00a0Ca2+\u00a0mobilization\u00a0by\u00a0 Gq/11\u00a0 protein-coupled\u00a0 GPCRs,\u00a0 especially\u00a0 metabotropic\u00a0 glutamate\u00a0 receptors\u00a0 1\u00a0 and\u00a0 5\u00a0 (mGluR1/5)\u00a0 [9].\u00a0 In\u00a0 addition,\u00a0 an\u00a0 aberrant\u00a0glutamatergic\u00a0 signalling\u00a0has\u00a0been\u00a0previously\u00a0 found\u00a0in\u00a0melanoma\u00a0[31,32]\u00a0and\u00a0other\u00a0types\u00a0of\u00a0cancer\u00a0[33,34].\u00a0Hence,\u00a0we\u00a0next\u00a0analysed\u00a0the\u00a0 status\u00a0of\u00a0glutamate\u00a0receptors.\u00a0The\u00a0expression\u00a0of\u00a0mGluR1\u00a0(GRM1)\u00a0and\u00a0mGluR5\u00a0(GRM5)\u00a0 was\u00a0conserved\u00a0from\u00a0primary\u00a0tumours\u00a0to\u00a0metastatic\u00a0samples,\u00a0but\u00a0moderate\u00a0changes\u00a0were\u00a0 evident\u00a0for\u00a0other\u00a0receptors\u00a0such\u00a0as\u00a0mGluR2/3/7/8\u00a0(GRM2,\u00a0GRM3,\u00a0GRM7,\u00a0and\u00a0GRM8)\u00a0(Figure\u00a02A).\u00a0Regarding\u00a0the\u00a0subunits\u00a0forming\u00a0ionotropic\u00a0glutamate\u00a0receptors,\u00a0namely\u00a0N-methyl-D-aspartate\u00a0 receptors\u00a0 (NMDARs)\u00a0 and\u00a0 alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic\u00a0acid\u00a0receptors\u00a0(AMPARs),\u00a0expression\u00a0changes\u00a0were\u00a0also\u00a0evident\u00a0between\u00a0 primary\u00a0and\u00a0metastatic\u00a0samples\u00a0(Figure\u00a02B,C).\u00a0Noteworthy,\u00a0among\u00a0NMDAR\u00a0subunits,\u00a0an\u00a0 upregulation\u00a0of\u00a0NMDAR2B\u00a0 (GRIN2B)\u00a0 in\u00a0metastases\u00a0was\u00a0 the\u00a0most\u00a0pronounced\u00a0change\u00a0 (Figure\u00a02B),\u00a0whereas\u00a0the\u00a0overexpression\u00a0of\u00a0GLUR2\u00a0(GRIA2)\u00a0could\u00a0be\u00a0highlighted\u00a0for\u00a0AMPAR\u00a0subunits\u00a0(Figure\u00a02C).\u00a0Changes\u00a0were\u00a0also\u00a0noticeable\u00a0for\u00a0PSD-95\u00a0(DLG4),\u00a0but\u00a0not\u00a0for\u00a0 GKAP\u00a0(DLGAP1)\u00a0or\u00a0BDNF\u00a0(BDNF),\u00a0three\u00a0proteins\u00a0downstream\u00a0of\u00a0NMDARs\u00a0(Figure\u00a02D)\u00a0 [20].\u00a0Taken\u00a0together,\u00a0these\u00a0transcriptomic\u00a0analyses\u00a0unveil\u00a0a\u00a0dysregulation\u00a0(conceivably\u00a0an\u00a0 overactivation)\u00a0of\u00a0glutamatoceptive\u00a0signalling\u00a0in\u00a0metastatic\u00a0melanoma\u00a0compared\u00a0to\u00a0primary\u00a0melanoma.\u00a0\nFigure .

            "text": "We next assessed whether melanoma cells express glutamate receptors and, if so, whether these receptors are important to sustain cell growth. For this purpose, we employed three different elanoma cell lines syngenically derived from the C57BL6 mouse strain: the YUMM1.7 cell line [35], the 1014 cell line [25], and the B16.F10 cell line [10]. These cell lines broadly account for two major melanoma-driving genetic mutations that are usually exclusive both in cell lines and tumours a d are present in 60\u201380% of melanomas [36], namely BRAFV600E/K (YUMM1.7) and NRASQ61R/K/L (1014), whereas B16.F10 cont ins wild-type forms of both roteins [37]. Quantitative PCR experiments showed that the three cell lines tested express variou mGl R subtypes, AMPAR nd NMDAR sub nits, as well as NMDAR-related proteins, such as PSD-95 (DLG4) and GKAP (DLGAP1) (Table 2).\nCancers 2023, 15, 2439 10 of 19 Cancers\u00a02023,\u00a015,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 10\u00a0 of\u00a0 21\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nCancers 2023, 15, 2439 11 of 19\nDLGAP1 34.65 \u00b1 2.12 29.81 \u00b1 8.80 36.86 \u00b1 2.04 Relative expression (in Ct) of glutamate receptors and related proteins in the 1014, YUMM1.7, and B16.F10 melanoma cell lines. N.D.: not detected.\nAs an initial approach to ascertain the importance of glutamatergic signalling in melanoma cell growth, we conducted cell viability assays in the presence of (i) LY341495, an mGluR pan-antagonist [38]; (ii) NBQX, an AMPAR-selective antagonist, [39]; or (iii) MK801, an NMDAR-selective antagonist [40]. Blockade of mGluRs for 48 h only reduced YUMM1.7 and B16.F10 cell viability at the highest dose tested (Figure 3A). We found a similar effect when inhibiting AMPARs, with solely the highest dose slightly decreasing the viability of the 1014 cell line (Figure 3B). In contrast, pharmacological blockade of NMDARs markedly and dose-dependently reduced cell viability in all cases (Figure 3C). To further support this effect, we treated cells with a submaximal dose of MK-801 (0.4 mM) for 24 h, and immunodetected the cell-proliferation marker, Ki67. The percentage of Ki67+ cells significantly decreased upon MK-801 challenge (Figure 3D). Taken together, these data support that NMDARs promote melanoma cell proliferation."

            "text": "Given the well-characterised role of CB1Rs in the control of glutamate release by nerve terminals [15] and the aforementioned data showing that NMDARs drive melanoma cell growth in vitro, we reasoned that neuronal CB1Rs could limit melanoma cell growth in the brain via a reduction of glutamate release. To assess this idea, we injected 1014 cells into the striatum of conditional knockout mice lacking the CB1R gene selectively in cortical glutamatergic/excitatory neurons (CB1Rfloxed/floxed;Nex1-Cre mice, herein referred to as GluCB1R-KO mice), and we analysed tumour growth by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These animals have increased glutamate levels in the striatum owing to the aforementioned CB1R genetic deletion, which leads to an enhanced glutamate release from excitatory cortical neurons that project onto the striatum [27,41]. Twelve days after implantation, tumours were clearly visible, and their volume was almost double in Glu-CB1R-KO mice than in wild-type control littermates (Figure 4A). In bare contrast, altering the release of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA upon deletion of the CB1R gene selectively from forebrain GABAergic/inhibitory neurons [27] (CB1Rfloxed/floxed;Dlx5/6-Cre mice, herein referred to as GABA-CB1R-KO mice) did not cause any overt alteration in tumour growth when using the same experimental setting (Figure 4A). Accordingly, the expression of the cell proliferation marker PCNA was increased in tumours grafted in Glu-CB1R-KO animals\nCancers 2023, 15, 2439 12 of 19\ncompared to control littermates, whereas

Comparisons were made by unpaired Student\u2019s t test.\nWhen assessing the status on NMDAR-associated signalling in tumour cells, we found that the expression of PSD-95, a protein essential to ensure NMDAR localization on surface membranes and post-synapses [42], was also selectively increased in tumours from Glu-CB1R-KO animals, thus supporting that a glutamate-NMDAR signalling axis fosters melanoma cell proliferation (Figure 5A). Immunodetection of NMDAR2B phosphorylated at Y1252 (p-NMDAR2B) has been previously used as a proxy for NMDAR activation [20,43]. Unfortunately, despite a number of attempts, we were unable to detect a reliable staini of p-NMDAR2B by immunofluorescence procedures in our samples sing commercially available antibodies, and the high abundance of mel in preclu ed an immunohistochemical appr ach as previously employed by others [20,43]. Thus, as an alt rnative, we obt ined umour extracts from a different cohort of animals and blotte them for p-NMDAR2B. Of note, a marked increase in p-NMDAR2B levels was evide in umour samples from Glu-CB1R-KO mice vs. their corresponding controls, whereas this effect was not evident in tumours from GABA-CB1R-KO mice (Figure 5B).\nCancers 2023, 15, 2439 13 of 19\nCancers\u00a02023,\u00a015,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 13\u00a0 of\u00a0 21\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nof\u00a0the\u00a0inhibitory\u00a0neurotransmitter\u00a0GABA\u00a0upon\u00a0deletion\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0CB1R\u00a0gene\u00a0selectively\u00a0from\u00a0 forebrain\u00a0GABAergic/inhibitory\u00a0neurons\u00a0[27]\u00a0(CB1Rfloxed/floxed;Dlx5/6\u2010Cre\u00a0mice,\u00a0herein\u00a0referred\u00a0to\u00a0 as\u00a0GABA-CB1R-KO\u00a0mice)\u00a0did\u00a0not\u00a0cause\u00a0any\u00a0overt\u00a0alteration\u00a0in\u00a0tumour\u00a0growth\u00a0when\u00a0using\u00a0 the\u00a0same\u00a0experimental\u00a0setting\u00a0(Figure\u00a04A).\u00a0Accordingly,\u00a0the\u00a0expression\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0cell\u00a0proliferation\u00a0marker\u00a0PCNA\u00a0was\u00a0increased\u00a0in\u00a0tumours\u00a0grafted\u00a0in\u00a0Glu-CB1R-KO\u00a0animals\u00a0compared\u00a0to\u00a0control\u00a0littermates,\u00a0whereas\u00a0this\u00a0effect\u00a0was\u00a0not\u00a0observed\u00a0in\u00a0GABA-CB1R-KO\u00a0animals\u00a0(Figure\u00a04B).\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFigure\u00a04.\u00a0Glutamatergic-neuron\u00a0CB1Rs\u00a0influence\u00a0melanoma\u00a0cell\u00a0growth\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0brain.\u00a0(A)\u00a0Glu-CB1R-\nKO,\u00a0GABA-CB1R-KO\u00a0and\u00a0control\u00a0littermates\u00a0of\u00a0both\u00a0sexes\u00a0were\u00a0intracranially\u00a0injected\u00a0with\u00a025,000\u00a0\n1014\u00a0cells\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0dorsal\u00a0striatum,\u00a0and\u00a012\u00a0days\u00a0later\u00a0subjected\u00a0to\u00a0MRI.\u00a0Representative\u00a0images\u00a0of\u00a0intra-\ncranial\u00a0tumours\u00a0and\u00a0tumour\u00a0volume\u00a0quantification\u00a0are\u00a0shown.\u00a0Circles:\u00a0male\u00a0mice;\u00a0triangles:\u00a0female\u00a0\nmice.\u00a0Comparisons\u00a0were\u00a0made\u00a0by\u00a0unpaired\u00a0Student\u2019s\u00a0t\u00a0test.\u00a0(B).\u00a0Percentage\u00a0of\u00a0proliferating,\u00a0PCNA-\nimmunoreactive\u00a0cells\u00a0in\u00a0tumour\u00a0brain\u00a0slices.\u00a0Representative\u00a0images\u00a0are\u00a0shown\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0top,\u00a0and\u00a0dot\u00a0\nplots\u00a0showing\u00a0quantifications\u00a0relative\u00a0 to\u00a0 total\u00a0cell\u00a0nuclei\u00a0are\u00a0shown\u00a0on\u00a0 the\u00a0bottom.\u00a0Comparisons\u00a0\nwere\u00a0made\u00a0by\u00a0unpaired\u00a0Student\u2019s\u00a0t\u00a0test.\u00a0\nWhen\u00a0 assessing\u00a0 the\u00a0 status\u00a0 on\u00a0NMDAR-associated\u00a0 signalling\u00a0 in\u00a0 tumour\u00a0 cells,\u00a0we\u00a0\nfound\u00a0that\u00a0the\u00a0expression\u00a0of\u00a0PSD-95,\u00a0a\u00a0protein\u00a0essential\u00a0to\u00a0ensure\u00a0NMDAR\u00a0localization\u00a0on\u00a0 surface\u00a0membranes\u00a0 and\u00a0post-synapses\u00a0 [42],\u00a0was\u00a0 also\u00a0 selectively\u00a0 increased\u00a0 in\u00a0 tumours\u00a0 from\u00a0Glu-CB1R-KO\u00a0animals,\u00a0 thus\u00a0supporting\u00a0 that\u00a0a\u00a0glutamate-NMDAR\u00a0signalling\u00a0axis\u00a0 fosters\u00a0melanoma\u00a0cell\u00a0proliferation\u00a0 (Figure\u00a05A).\u00a0 Immunodetection\u00a0of\u00a0NMDAR2B\u00a0phosphorylated\u00a0at\u00a0Y1252\u00a0 (p-NMDAR2B)\u00a0has\u00a0been\u00a0previously\u00a0used\u00a0as\u00a0a\u00a0proxy\u00a0 for\u00a0NMDAR\u00a0\nFigure 4.

Comparisons were made by unpaired Student\u2019s t test.\nNext, we aimed to analyse whether the action f neuronal CB1Rs in controlling glutamate release was also important for cell extravas tion during BM format on. To study the initial colonisation steps of MBMs rather than only c ll proliferation [44], we injected 1014 cells in the carotid artery of Glu-CB1R-KO and GABA-CB1R-KO mice, and analysed tumour burden in these animals (Figure 6A). The data revealed no significant differences in mutant mice as compared to their respective wild-type control littermates (Figure 6A), suggesting that the increased tumour volume observed in the intracranial-allograft approach is mostly due to an increased cell proliferation and is not related to an altered cell extravasation. Likewise, tail vein-injection [20] of 1014 cells colonized the lungs similarly in Glu-CB1R-KO than in control animals (Figure 6B). To further evaluate the tissue specificity of this brain CB1R/glutamate/NMDAR proliferative axis, 1014 cells were injected subcutaneously in the flank of Glu-CB1R-KO mice and their control littermates. No differences in tumour onset or tumour growth were evident between the two genotypes (Figure 6C). Taken together, these experiments support a pro-tumorigenic environment specific to the brain of Glu-CB1R-KO mice, most likely due to a disinhibition of glutamate release from excitatory nerve terminals.\nCancers 2023, 15, 2439 14 of 19\nCancers\u00a02023,\u00a015,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 14\u00a0 of\u00a0 21\u00a0

            "text": "Despite milestone achievements in the treatment of melanoma, many individuals die from this devastating disease, particularly those who develop MBMs. Unfortunately, only a few and hardly effective therapeutic interventions exist for MBMs [3]. Thus, the identification of molecular mechanisms that influence the growth of melanoma cells selectively in the brain is crucial for identifying novel pharmacological targets. Here, combining in silico data mining with in vitro and in vivo experimental approaches, we unveil an unprecedented signalling axis for MBM cell proliferation that involves CB1Rs, neuron-secreted glutamate, and the activation of melanoma cell NMDARs. This pro-tumorigenic action of glutamate adds to previous observations reporting that this neurotransmitter influences the proliferation of glioma cells and promotes the invasive tumour growth of breast, pancreatic, and neuroendocrine cancers through AMPARs and NMDARs [20\u201322,34]. In fact, similar effects occur in melanoma cells, which thrive when exposed to high glutamate levels [45], and eventually die upon exposure to the glutamate-release inhibitor riluzole [46]. In line with previous reports, we show that melanoma cells express several glutamate receptors, including NMDARs [47,48], and that their pharmacological blockade (with MK-801) impairs melanoma cell proliferation. These observations resemble those obtained with other cancer-cell types [49], as well as those with a melanoma-cell-based xenograft model [47]. Nonetheless, despite this plethora of evidence, the role of glutamate as a brain-specific proliferative factor for melanoma had not been addressed in detail yet. So far, most studies had considered glutamate as an autocrine signal produced by the cancer cell itself [50,51], including the melanoma cell [32,52] and, to the best of our knowledge, the potential neuronal origin of this pro-oncogenic glutamate upon MBMs has been overlooked. We consider this latter possibility plausible for several reasons: (i) other metabolites abundant in the central nervous system, such as lactate and ketone bodies, promote melanoma metastasis [53]; (ii) melanoma and other cancer cells establish in the brain ways of communication with neurons and astrocytes, thereby hijacking neuronal and glial signalling pathways [17,18,20\u201323]; and (iii) melanoma cells adopt in the brain a neuron-like, brain-adaptive phenotype that upregulates several genes involved in synapse formation (e.g., SNCA), cell adhesion (e.g., LRRC1), and the sensing of neurotrophic factors (e.g., NGFR) [54,55], all of which strongly supports an interaction with brain components. Interestingly, a recent report showed that treating mice with glutamate scavengers reduces blood and cerebrospinal fluid glutamate concentrations in association with a decrease in brain melanoma cell growth [56]. Thus, glutamate seems an important pro-tumorigenic factor for brain melanoma cells and, logically, glutamatergic neurons represent a potential glutamate source. Following this notion, we found that 1014 melanoma cells injected in the brain (but not when inoculated in other sites) of Glu-CB1R-KO mice proliferate more markedly than in wild-type or GABA-CB1R-KO mice. The intracranial-injection model is ideal to identify factors that foster brain melanoma cell growth, which represents a critical step for the clinical management of MBMs rather than cell invasion/extravasation, as most patients already display metastatic foci when diagnosed [57]. Tumours growing in the brain of Glu-CB1R-KO mice exhibited a higher activation of NMDARs (as assessed by phosphorylation of the NMDAR2B subunit and the expression of the NMDAR-adaptor protein PSD-95) and an increased expression of the proliferation marker PCNA. This observation strongly supports the existence of a neuron-melanoma cell crosstalk, given that glutamatergic neurons release higher amounts of glutamate in the Glu-CB1R-KO mouse strain [41], and that glutamate enhances the proliferation of 1014 and other melanoma cell lines in vitro [45]. NMDARs are heterotetramers composed of two NMDAR1 subunits and two NMDAR2 or two NMDAR3 subunits, which are usually exclusive. Intriguingly, disrupting mutations in the GRIN2A gene are frequent in melanoma [58], and they are associated with bad prognosis [59]. To reconcile these apparently paradoxical observations, we speculate that the subunit composition of NMDARs, which dramatically impacts the receptor\u2019s functional\nCancers 2023, 15, 2439 16 of 19\nproperties [60], might influence melanoma cell growth. Strikingly, in the GDC-TCGA SKCM dataset, a high expression of GRIN3A is associated with longer overall survival (low GRIN3A median survival: 1960 days; high GRIN3A median survival: 4930 days; p < 0.0001 by Log-rank (Mantel\u2013Cox) test). Therefore, a plausible explanation to be explored in the future is that mutant forms of GRIN2A and/or a low expression of GRIN3A favour the integration of other subunits, such as NMDAR2B, that, in turn, alter NMDAR\u2019s biophysical properties to favour a proliferative signalling axis. Further research is warranted as well to identify downstream effectors that, upon NMDAR activation, sustain the proliferation of MBMs. On the other hand, the potential involvement of the ECS, and particularly of CB1Rs, in the growth of MBMs, should come as no surprise, as the activation of this receptor generally occurs when homeostasis is perturbed in the brain and other tissues [61]. Pharmacological activation of CB1Rs upon systemic administration of cannabinoid agonists triggers tumourcell apoptosis in numerous mouse models of cancer, especially glioblastoma, the most common form of brain cancer [62,63], but to which extent this event relies, at least in part, on CB1R molecules located on tumour-microenvironment-forming cells (such as neurons in MBMs) remains largely unknown. It has been previously shown that cannabinoid administration inhibits melanoma cell growth in subcutaneous-allograft mouse models, and limits liver and lung colonisation by melanoma cells [10,12]. We are aware that one of the shortcomings of the present study is that no pharmacological experiments have been conducted on MBMs in vivo. A drug treatment, in principle, is not cell population-specific. In our case, broadly speaking, a systemic cannabinoid administration to mice bearing MBMs will target every body cell expressing CB1Rs or CB2Rs, therefore precluding the interpretation of the results obtained. Ideally, to dissect the precise subpopulations of CB1Rs involved, these experiments should be conducted with (i) different doses of a CB1Rselective antagonist and a CB1R-selective agonist (plus their vehicle control); (ii) various lines of age-matched, genetically-modified mice (at least Glu-CB1R-KO and GABA-CB1RKO mice, plus their CB1R-floxed littermates); and (iii) CB1R-WT and CB1R-KO melanoma cells. These experiments are beyond the scope of the present study and will be the subject of future research by our group."
