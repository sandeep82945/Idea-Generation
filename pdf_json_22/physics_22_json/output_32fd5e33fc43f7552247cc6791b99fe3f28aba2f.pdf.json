    "abstractText": "Momentum-space polarization vortices centered at symmetry-protected bound states in the continuum of a periodic structure, e.g. photonic crystal slab, provide a novel nonlocal approach to generate vortex beams. This approach enjoys a great convenience of no precise alignment requirements, although the generation efficiency of the nonlocal generators requires further optimization before the practical application. In this work, we propose a temporal-coupled-mode-theory-based guideline for high-efficiency nonlocal reflection-type vortex generator design.The conversion efficiency of the vortex beam is found to be limited by the ratio of the radiative loss to the intrinsic absorption in practical systems. To increase this ratio through mode selection and structure design, the photonic crystal slabs are theoretically designed and experimentally characterized, showing a maximum on-resonance conversion efficiency of up to 86%. Combining high efficiency with simple fabrication and no requirement for precise alignment, reflection-type photonic crystal slabs could offer a new and competitive way to generate vortex beams flexibly.",

            "text": "The orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light is a new degree of freedom that can be used to modulate propagating lights [1,2].The vortex beam (VB), as one of the carriers of OAM, features a spiral wave front and a central zero-intensity singularity [3,4]. Applications of VBs have been extensively investigated in imaging [5], optical manipulation [6\u20138] and optical communication [9] since VBs were first discovered in 1992 [10]. To implement these applications, VB generation has been realized over a wide wavelength range [11\u201317], with VBs mostly being generated using structures with an alignment center.\nThese conventional methods follow a similar intrinsic motivation to generate VBs, which involves the manipulation of incident beams using observable spiral or rotating structures in real space to form the spiral phase distributions. Among these methods, the most direct approach is to use a spiral phase plate that has a radially varying thickness to accumulate the spiral propagation phase for normally incident plane waves andwas first realized atmillimetrewave frequency [18]. As a feasible method for use in the visible light range, the q-plate is an inhomogeneous half-wave plate made from liquid crystal that has a rotating in-plane optical axis orientation; the qplate will add an additional spiral phase distribution to the normal incident beam, while also performing its polarization transformation function [19]. A programmable version has been derived based on the same generating principle in the form of a spatial light modulator [20\u201322]. Additionally, spiral wave fronts can also be recovered using fork-gratingshaped interference patterns recorded by holograms [23]. In recent years, a more compact and integrablemethod, called themetasurface [24], has been demonstrated tobe capable of performingVBgeneration in the near infrared and visible light ranges using individually designed and fabricated units. However, all the generators mentioned above require the beam centers to be carefully aligned with their respective geometric centers. In the visible region, the resulting alignment difficulties become significant in practical applications.\nC\u00a9TheAuthor(s) 2022.

These periodic structures, e.g. two-dimensional photonic crystal (PhC) slabs, can reduce difficulties caused by beam alignment and high-precision fabrication requirements in practical applications, although the low generation efficiency that occurs in conventional methods also occurs in this method."

            "text": "To improve VB generation efficiency, by intricately designing individual units at micro- or nanometer scale, metasurface generators have realized great progress [31,32]. Similar to the metasurface, the perfect mirror can also be introduced to block the transmission channels in nonlocal VB generation systems, which will then only transfer the incident energy to the reflection channel. We theoretically proposed that VB generation using single resonances and a perfect mirror in a reflection-type system can achieve 100% cross-polarized conversion efficiency [33]. However, when the practical applications at visible and near-infraredwavelengths are considered, the absorption of the metal mirror will inevitably cause a loss that will reduce the conversion efficiency of such a VB generator greatly. In this work, we propose a general picture based on temporal coupled mode theory (TCMT) [34] to improve the VB generation efficiency of reflectiontype generators with intrinsic absorption, which is determined by the ratio of the radiative loss to the intrinsic absorption. Based on this picture, mode selection and structure design are employed to increase this ratio efficiently. In both simulations and experiments, the maximum on-resonance conversion efficiency of the designed reflection-type PhC VB generators reaches up to 86%. The VB profiles generated at different wavelengths and in different working regions are also observed experimentally.\nTo illustrate the mechanism of a nonlocal VB generator, considering aPhC slab for a particular frequency, a resonant mode, e.g. a guided resonance [35], above the light cone and below the diffraction limit will radiate into free space whose state of polarization (SOP) can therefore be defined in the far field. Close to the at- bound state in the continuum (BIC), the SOPs of these guided resonances are nearly linearly polarized [36]. The major axes of these states rotate around the BIC singularity, driven by the rotational symmetry of the PhC slabs [30], forming strong polarization anisotropy in\nparaxial fields that leads to an extrinsic spin-orbit interaction [37\u201340]. When circularly polarized light impinges upon a PhC slab and interacts with these guided resonances around the BIC, the converted cross-polarized light will then gain Pancharatnam\u2013 Berry phases [41] and form a spiral wave front. The topological charge l of the spiral wave front is thus determined by the polarization charge q of the BIC, where l = \u22122 \u00d7 q [30]. In addition, the polarization charge q of a BIC has been studied and has been shown to depend on the real space symmetry of the PhC slabs and the symmetry representation of the BICmode [26,27].\nFor this generation principle, the VB generation efficiency is limited by the conversion efficiency of the resonance process. The topological charge l of the spiral wave front is thus determined by the polarization charge q of the BIC, where l= \u22122\u00d7 q [30]. In addition, the polarization charge q of a BIC has been studied and has been shown to depend on the real space symmetry of the PhC slabs and the symmetry representation of the BICmode [26,27].\nIn TCMT, the dynamics of a resonance A(k ||) on an isolated band [34] in a system with material absorption can be formulated as\ndA dt\n= \u239b \u239d\u2212i\u03c90 \u2212 \u03b30 \u2212 \u2211\ni=s,p \u03b3i\n\u239e \u23a0 A + K T |s+\u3009,\n(1)\n|s\u2212\u3009 = C |s+\u3009 + D A = S |s+\u3009. (2)\nHere,A is the amplitude of the resonancewith eigenfrequency \u03c90,\u03b3 0 is the intrinsic loss due to material absorption and \u03b3 i is the radiative loss. The column vectors |s+\u3009 = (s+, p+)T and |s\u2212\u3009 = (s\u2212, p\u2212)T refer to the amplitudes of the incident and reflected light, respectively. We select the basis of s and p polarization to describe the system\u2019s two orthogonal energy ports to free space.The two-by-two matrix C provides the generalized background scattering matrix, with the two-by-twomatrix S as the generalized scattering matrix. For a single resonance above the light cone and below the diffraction limit, the coupling matrices K = (ks , kp)T and D = (ds , dp)T are both two-by-onematrices.We can then certainly use the orthogonal coupling coefficients (ds, dp) to describe the SOP of the resonance[30].\nConsidering the energy conservation and timereversal consideration, there are several constraints for the parameters above, which are written as\nD\u2020D = 2\u03b3i , (3) D = K , (4)\nC D\u2217 = \u2212D. (5)\nPage 2 of 7\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nsr/article/10/5/nw ac234/6769861 by guest on 18 January 2024\nBecause of the fact that the SOPs of the resonances near the at- bound states in the continuum are nearly linearly polarized [36], we then assume that the discussed resonance only coupled to the spolarized port: \u03b3 i = \u03b3s . Then, we obtain the results from the scattering matrix:\n|ds | = \u221a 2\u03b3s , |dp | = 0, (6)\nS = ( 1 \u2212 2\u03b3s /[\u2212i (\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c90) + \u03b30 + \u03b3s ] 0\n0 1\n)\ne i\u03c6 = ( s11 0\n0 1\n) e i\u03c6. (7)\nWe consider the resonances along the ky-axis direction under near normal incidence to discuss their responses with different polarized incidences. In this case, the x (y) polarizations are nearly equivalent to the s (p) polarizations, with dx \u2248 ds, dy \u2248 dp = 0.The reflectance and absorptance that occur under x- (s-) and y- (p-)polarized incidence conditions are\nRs (\u03c9) = |s11|2, (8)\nAs (\u03c9) = 1 \u2212 Rs (\u03c9) = 4\u03b30\u03b3s(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c90)2 + (\u03b30 + \u03b3s )2 .\n(9)\nTherefore, TCMT parameters (\u03b3s , \u03b30 and \u03c90) can then be obtained from reflectance spectra.\nFor a polarization vortex near the at- BIC, the major axes of the SOPs would rotate around the point.Considering a\u03c8 angle between themajor axes of the SOPand thex axes, similar conclusions are obtained via a rotational transformation of the axis. By transforming the basis from the s (p) basis |s\u3009s, p to the helical basis |s\u3009l, r [30], we can then describe the corresponding cases under circularly polarized incidence conditions:\n|s\u2212\u3009l ,r = T\u22121he l i c al R\u22121(\u03c8)ST he l i c al R(\u03c8)|s+\u3009l ,r\n= 1 2 ( s11 + 1 (s11 \u2212 1)e i2\u03c8 (s11 \u2212 1)e\u2212i2\u03c8 s11 + 1 ) |s+\u3009l ,r .\n(10)\nIf the incidence is circularly polarized, it canbe found that the cross-polarized terms would gain a geometric phase [41] factor with different values of \u03c8 , and the corresponding cross-polarized conversion efficiency is\nRc (\u03c9) = \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 s11 \u2212 12 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 2 = \u03b3 2 s (\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c90)2 + (\u03b30 + \u03b3s )2 .\n(11)\nIt is clearly shown here that the cross-polarized conversion efficiency will approach 100% on resonance when \u03b30 vanishes. Practically, a reflectiontype generator will still achieve a high conversion efficiency easily when \u03b3s \u03b30, as shown in the top left corner of Fig. 1(c). Because \u03b30 relates to the intrinsic loss of the system and \u03b3s to the scattering of the guided resonance, mode selection and structure design are proposed to inhibit \u03b30 and enlarge \u03b3s . For instance, as plotted in Fig. 1(b), the electric field of the first transverse-magnetic (TM)-like band is located on the mirror surface (see the online supplementary material), which leads to a large loss, while that of the second transverse-electric (TE)-like band approaches zero in the vicinity of the mirror, which leads to a smaller \u03b30. With regard to \u03b3s , the radiative loss of the guided resonance corresponds to the light scattering caused by the periodic structures, for which the designed geometric parameters of the unit cells require further refinement.\nTo verify the above guideline, we designed reflection-type two-dimensional PhC slabs with the metallic mirror and characterized their conversion efficiencies both theoretically and experimentally. The studied reflection-type PhC slab consists of a flat silver mirror coated with an adhesion layer and a periodically etched Si3N4 dielectric layer. The silver mirror is formed by a 300-nm-thick film that was evaporated on a silicon substrate, above which a 25-nm-thick SiO2 film was coated as an adhesion layer.The periodic structures are circular air hole arrays arranged in a square lattice with their fixed period of 460 nm; these structures were fabricated by electron beam lithography on dielectric layers.\nTo inhibit the \u03b30 of the system, the TE2 band was selected for the VB generation. As a VB generator, the momentum-space polarization field of the selected TE2 band is shown in the online supplementarymaterial, with the BICbeing centered at the point and the charge of the polarization vortex being +1. Considering the circularly polarized incidence, the cross-polarized light reflected via such a polarization vortex will gain a 4\u03c0 spiral phase along any clockwise loop around the BIC singularity. As examples, the calculated phase distribution and the cross-polarized conversion efficiency iso-frequency contour of the TE2 band were plotted in Fig. 2(a) and (b), respectively. To demonstrate the inhibition of\u03b30, the electric field of theTE2 band at k ||a/2\u03c0 = (0.04, 0) is shown in Fig. 2(c).The electric field was demonstrated to gather sparingly above the silver film surface, indicating that only a small level of material absorption occurred in the system.\nTo enhance \u03b3s further in the selected TE2 band, three geometrical parameters in the PhC slab required to be determined: the etched depth h, the\nPage 3 of 7\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nsr/article/10/5/nw ac234/6769861 by guest on 18 January 2024\nhole radius r and the dielectric layer thicknessH.We focused on the conversion efficiency at k ||a/2\u03c0 = (0.04, 0) on the iso-frequency contour to determine the parameters that provided high conversion efficiency. Starting with the PhC slab with parameters h = 300 nm, r = 160 nm and H = 480 nm, each of the parameters were varied within certain ranges to observe the variation in Rc. On the one hand, Rc at k ||a/2\u03c0 = (0.04, 0) can be calculated with the different PhC parameters using rigorous coupledwave analysis (RCWA) [42], as plotted with gray lines in Fig. 2(d). On the other hand, based on (11), the conversion efficiencywas calculatedusing\u03b30 and \u03b3s that can be extracted from the reflectance spectra (see the online supplementarymaterial).The obtained \u03b30 and \u03b3s values are depicted with light blue lines and the dark blue lines in Fig. 2(d), respectively. It was found that \u03b30 is near zero, thus verifying the small level of absorption, and \u03b3s was strongly influenced by the structure. Using the extracted \u03b30 and \u03b3s , the Rc spectra were then calculated using (11) and are indicated with green square markers in Fig. 2(d), which matched the simulated results well. With respect to the different selected parameters, Rc varied from 50% up to nearly 90% and remained\nhigher than 80% over a wide parameter range, forming large flat steps in the middle of each panel. The high-efficiency flat step was also demonstrated experimentally and is shown in the online supplementary material.\nBy selecting a group of structural parameters on this flat step, i.e. h = 337 nm, r = 186 nm and H = 519 nm, the PhC slab was fabricated and characterized experimentally. As indicated by the polarization maps plotted in the online supplementary material, the proposed TE2 band in the vicinity of the atBIC is only excited by s-polarized incident light along -X, and the measured and calculated angleresolved reflectance spectra under the s-polarized incidence along the -X direction are illustrated in Fig. 3(a) and (b), respectively. The optical measurements were performed using our homemade angle-resolved imaging spectroscopy system [43\u201345], and the theoretical spectra were simulated via RCWA. The marked TE2 band was used to generate the VB. The central frequency \u03c90 and the corresponding \u03b3s and \u03b30 values were extracted via numerically fitting the reflectance spectra at different wave vectors; examples are shown in Fig. 3(c). The cross-polarized conversion efficiency Rc in the experiments was obtained from the measured s-polarized reflectance spectra using (11). Obtained Rc values of the experimental TE2 band at the different wavelengths are marked as green squares in Fig. 3(d), while the simulated Rc spectra along -X under circularly polarized incidence are plotted as gray lines, showing high conversion efficiency over the entire TE2 band and also showing good agreement with the theory; a detailed comparison is shown in the online supplementary material.\nTo further characterize the VB profiles, we built a home-made reflection-type Fourier-optics-based imaging system that had an imaging mode and an interferometer mode; a schematic diagram of this system is shown in Fig. 4(a).

In this mode, the reference light was not introduced into themeasurement process.The incident laser was circularly polarized by a circular polarizermodule (lefthanded circularly polarized, or LCP) that included a linear polarizer and a 1/4 wave plate (1/4\u03bb), and was then focusedonour fabricatedPhCslab through an objective lens (OL). The focused light impinged upon the PhC slab in all the directions allowed by the numerical aperture and was coupled with the k-variant guided resonances surrounding the BIC, causing the reflected light on these resonances to be strongly cross-polarized. Reversely passing through the same OL and circular polarizer module, the reflected light was then Fourier transformed into the momentum space. The beam profile was finally detected by a charge-coupled device (CCD) after imaging using a set of confocal lenses (L3 and L4). Byvarying thewavelengthof the incident laser, beam profiles at 774.9, 777.2 and 779.1 nm, marked as orange dashed lines in Fig. 3(a), are plotted in the left panel in Fig. 4(b). It was observed that the generated beams had doughnut-shaped far-field profiles with central zero-intensity points,which is a key feature of VBs. Following the dispersion of the TE2 band, the beam profile extended gradually in the momentum space and maintained high conversion efficiency.\nThen, we switched on the mirror slightly to apply reference light for the operating interferometer mode.The linearly polarized reference lightwasused to illuminate the CCD to obtain interference patterns between the generated spiral wave front and the reference wave front. The interference patterns measured at the three wavelengths above are illustrated in the corresponding right panel of Fig. 4(b), where two obvious spiral arms can be observed at the profile center. This combination of a doughnutshaped beam profile and the existence of spiral arms verified that the cross-polarized beam reflected by our fabricated PhC slab was a VB with a topological charge l= \u22122. Performing a Laguerre\u2013Gaussian modal decomposition of the experimentally generated VB beam at 774.9 nm indicated that the energy of the l=\u22122 components accounted for 81.6% of the total energy of the generated beam, details of which are presented in the online supplementary material.\nFurthermore, selecting three different regions on our fabricated PhC slab to perform the measurements, the beam profiles and the interference patternsweremeasured repeatedly with the incident light at 774.9 nm. The measurement regions are highlightedwith red dots in the optical image shown in Fig. 5. By rotating the 1/4 wave plate, we demonstrated beam generation with both right-handed\nPage 5 of 7\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nsr/article/10/5/nw ac234/6769861 by guest on 18 January 2024\ncircularly polarized (RCP) and LCP incidence. The beam profiles and the interference patterns remain unchanged, indicating that high-efficiency generation of the VB using a singularity in momentum space is nonlocal, i.e. it does not rely on the working position.\nHere, we present some discussion. First, the nonlocal VB generation using our proposed principle is related to the at- BIC,which canbe realizedflexibly at different wavelengths by tuning or even by simply scaling the structural parameters to make the band fall into the desired working region (see the online supplementary material). Additionally, we further make some comparison with some previous works that havemade efforts to generate VBs viamanipulations in momentum space. In these works, multiplebeam interference and spin-pseudospin coupling were used to selectively excite pseudospins located at K or K\u2019 valleys in artificial photonic graphene to generate VBs [46,47]. Note that these detected angular momentums did not result from the nonzero Berry curvature at the K and K\u2019 valleys, but instead resulted fromthe initial pseudospinsof theDirac system, while ours come from the polarization vortex existing around the at- BIC. For practical applications, their methods may be suitable for generating VBs with oblique incidence, while our PhC-based methods are feasible with normal incidence."
