Narrative Efficacy in Changing Consumption Patterns: Conduct empirical studies to measure the impact of different sustainability narratives (e.g., human-nature interdependence, Circular Economy) on changing consumption behaviors. This research could compare the effectiveness of various narrative strategies across diverse cultural and social contexts to identify which narratives are most influential in promoting sustainable consumption practices.

Narrative Co-creation Processes: Investigate the processes of co-creating sustainability narratives involving stakeholders from multiple sectors (science, business, politics, civil society). This research would aim to understand how collaborative narrative-building can enhance the adoption of sustainable behaviors and identify the mechanisms through which co-created narratives gain acceptance and influence within communities.

Longitudinal Studies on Narrative Adoption and Behavioral Change: Design longitudinal studies to track how individuals and communities adopt new sustainability narratives over time and how these narratives influence long-term changes in consumption behavior. This research could help identify the stages of narrative integration into personal and collective identities and the factors that support or hinder sustained behavioral change towards more sustainable practices.

Comparative Analysis of Narrative and Non-Narrative Interventions: Compare the effectiveness of narrative-based interventions with other types of interventions aimed at promoting sustainable consumption (e.g., economic incentives, policy regulations, educational programs). This research would help delineate the unique contributions of narratives to behavior change and how they can be effectively integrated with other strategies for maximum impact.

Narratives and Technological Innovation in Sustainability: Explore how narratives of human-nature interdependence and Circular Economy influence the development and adoption of sustainable technologies. This research could examine how narratives shape the priorities of technological innovation, consumer acceptance of sustainable technologies, and the integration of these technologies into everyday life. It would contribute to understanding how narratives can accelerate the transition towards more sustainable technological ecosystems.
