    "abstractText": "In our study, we investigated the change patterns in academics\u2019 servant leadership behavior and affective commitment during and after the first Covid-19 lockdown (April 2020\u2013 August 2020) in Malaysia. Furthermore, we evaluated the influence of academics\u2019 servant leadership behavior on job performance through affective commitment. We applied additional analyses to determine the degree to which the two former constructs are influenced by age and academic rank. To do so, we leveraged multivariate latent growth curve (LGC) modeling in analyzing the longitudinal data collected from 220 academics at three time points over a course of four months during the Covid-19 pandemic. Our results showed that, while servant leadership and affective commitment were stable over time, servant leadership was a driver of affective commitment and job performance. We also observed that affective commitment significantly mediated the relationship between academics\u2019 servant leadership behavior and job performance. Moreover, we found interindividual differences in servant leadership and affective commitment in terms of age and academic rank at the beginning of the Covid-19 lockdown. Our multi-disciplinary research is among the limited number of studies applying a rigorous, longitudinal approach to examine behaviors (i.e., servant leadership and job performance) and attitudes (i.e., affective commitment) during the Covid-19 pandemic in higher education research.",

The ongoing pandemic, however, changed a lot of practices in all sectors (Mihalache and Mihalache 2022), and higher education is no exception (Mok and Montgomery 2021). New and updated policies were implemented worldwide to maximize the academic communities\u2019 safety and to ensure that the process of quality teaching and learning was not adversely affected by the pandemic (Ghasemy and Elwood 2022). The global experience and diverse aspects included distinguish the Covid-19 pandemic from crises we have known so far (Mihalache & Mihalache 2022). Social distancing, despite its impact on peoples\u2019 subjective well-being (Damberg and Fr\u00f6mbling 2021), was encouraged by government policies with respect to lockdowns and working from home in many countries (Kumar et\u00a0al. 2021). Wang et\u00a0al. (2020), for example, found that psychological isolation, not physical isolation, adversely affects the emotional relationship of employees to their organizations.\nWe do not know much about human resource management during the Covid-19 pandemic (Adikaram et\u00a0al. 2021), which put a lot of pressure on leaders (Collings et\u00a0al. 2021). Nevertheless, overall, the implemented policies have proven to be effective, but leaders encountered many challenges in steering universities forward during these hard times (Perrotta 2021), adding to already recognized leadership challenges in different university types (Ghasemy et\u00a0al. 2018). Drew (2010, pp. 61\u201362), for example, discovered five general challenges in academic leadership: (1) fiscal and people resources, (2) flexibility, creativity, and change-capability, (3) responding to competing tensions and remaining relevant, (4) maintaining academic quality, and (5) effective strategic leadership. Especially the last point indicates that universities were and still are in need of a relevant leadership philosophy enabling to tackle the pandemic-related, emerging barriers. Best practices in academic leadership responses to crises, as recommended by Fernandez and Shaw (2020), are building trust, distributing leadership, and clear communication; reminding us of a few of servant leadership\u2019s most important aspects.\nServant leadership provides the potential to address modern challenges, such as the ones of technological advancement, economic globalization, as well as disease and starvation (Parris and Peachey 2013). The study by Parris and Peachey (2013) could not have known about the Covid-19 pandemic as a disease, but servant leadership\u2019s role in guiding and engaging employees during Covid-19 (Hu et\u00a0al. 2020) and in contexts of uncertainty (Correia de Sousa and van Dierendonck 2014) has already been highlighted in the literature. Furthermore, servant leadership can have a positive influence on organizational functioning and organizational outcomes on the individual as well as the team level (Lee et\u00a0al. 2020; Rosa-D\u00edaz et\u00a0al. 2021). For instance, this leadership style is important in enhancing employees\u2019 creativity (Yang et\u00a0al. 2019) and has huge relevance in institutions of higher learning (Ghasemy et\u00a0al. 2022a, b; Wheeler 2012). Moreover, servant leadership helps in developing a caring and just society (Beck 2014). Higher education, as one of the major change agents in societies, needs leaders, who have a moral compass (Dean 2014). However, there is clearly a need for research on servant leadership practices in general (Zhao et\u00a0al. 2016) as well as in educational institutions in particular (Eva et\u00a0al. 2019).\nReforms in higher education change performance management practices (Kallio et\u00a0al. 2016) and provide a need to reevaluate universities\u2019 leadership effectiveness and commitment among their employees (Yahaya and Ebrahim 2016). In addition, servant leadership\n1 3\ninfluences organizational outcomes, such as in-role performance (Liden et\u00a0 al. 2015) and affective commitment (Sendjaya et\u00a0al. 2019). Moreover, organizational commitment itself was identified as an essential element for facilitating positive individual and organizational outcomes (DeCotiis and Summers 1987). Examples for such outcomes are organizational citizenship behavior (Meyer et\u00a0al. 2002), organizational productivity and scholars\u2019 performance (Weiherl and Frost 2016), and also reduced negative outcomes, such as academics\u2019 turnover intention (Johnsrud and Rosser 2002).\nUniversities need to do the splits between complying to global quality standards and differentiation compared to their competitors (Kallio et\u00a0 al. 2016). The integral business of a university is research and teaching, yet, the quality of research performance sets a top university apart from its competitors (Ponnuswamy and Manohar 2016). Hence, universities put a growing emphasis on performance of academic units as well as individual academics (Manathunga et\u00a0al. 2017), and also university lecturers feel the growing pressure to achieve satisfactory research performance (Tagliaventi and Carli 2019). Although research has given attention to different aspects of scholars\u2019 performance, a new interest has sparked regarding our understanding of what might foster or hamper the achievement of satisfying research performance (Tagliaventi and Carli 2019).\nGiven the current stressful Covid-19 pandemic, studying academics\u2019 performance becomes critical, since there is evidence that increased work-related stress depletes an individual\u2019s energy and attention, which, in turn, can result in lower job performance levels (Gilboa et\u00a0al. 2008). Hence, considering servant leadership\u2019s importance and relevance in enhancing organizational commitment and job performance, and the lack of research on these relationships in academic organizations, we designed a longitudinal research study to examine those connections. We would like to note a few studies that are related to our research purpose. Yousef (2000) included organizational commitment as a mediator between leadership behavior and job performance in a multicultural, non-Western country. Yiing and Kamarul Zaman (2009) examined the relationship between leadership behavior and organizational commitment as well as between organizational commitment and job satisfaction/job performance by including organizational culture as a moderator among students and academic personnel in Malaysia. However, Yahaya and Ebrahim (2016) noted that only a few studies investigated the connection between leadership and organizational commitment in the higher education system of developing countries.\nGiven that Malaysia is a multicultural, non-Western country, and since the studies by Yousef (2000) and Yiing and Kamarul Zaman (2009) did not explicitly consider servant leadership, we believe this concept is worth exploring in the Malaysian higher education context. Malaysia is an educational hub in Southeast Asia (Ghasemy et\u00a0 al. 2021a; Lee 2014) and has several social/cultural similarities with its neighboring countries, such as Indonesia and Singapore. Especially less developed and developing countries benefit from the establishment of universities (Baykan et\u00a0al. 2018; Qazi et\u00a0al. 2014) and the Malaysian education sector has experienced notable transformation aiming to improve teaching and learning standards (Johari et\u00a0al. 2018).\nConsequently, we collected data from 220 academics in Malaysia at three time points\u2014 April 2020, the beginning of the lockdown (Time 1), June 2020, the end of the lockdown (Time 2), and August 2020, two months after the lockdown (Time 3). To analyze our data, we applied the multivariate\u00a0 latent growth curve (LGC) modeling methodology (Duncan et\u00a0al. 2006). We formulated the following two research questions: (1) To what extent does academics\u2019 servant leadership behavior, directly, and indirectly through affective commitment, influence job performance over time? and (2) What influence do academic rank and age have on the means and change rates of servant leadership and affective commitment?\n1 3\nSubsequently, our analysis produced the following answers and findings: (1) we observed that academics\u2019 servant leadership behavior and affective commitment were stable and contributed to job performance during our assessment period, (2) we found affective commitment to partially mediate the relationship between servant leadership and job performance, and (3) we noted that, at the beginning of the lockdown, age had an influence on servant leadership behavior, while academic rank had an impact on affective commitment. Hence, we contribute to research and practice by providing insights into the less researched construct of servant leadership, the important context of the Malaysian higher education system, and the influence of the Covid-19 pandemic. Notably, higher education harmonization policies and initiatives have been implemented in Southeast Asia (Morshidi et\u00a0 al. 2016; Yavaprabhas 2014). Therefore, we expect the results obtained in the Malaysian context to be transferable to similar higher education contexts.\nOur research study is structured as follows: first, we provide the theoretical background to derive our research model. Second, we present our methodology. Third, we show our results and, consequently, discuss them in theoretical and practical terms. Last, we conclude with our limitations and further research suggestions."

            "text": "Servant leadership is a trait-based leadership theory postulating that effective leaders embody a key set of desirable characteristics that, subject to what is agreed on as being socially desirable in a particular place and time, changes across contexts (Dean 2014). This leadership concept was developed in a low power distance country, though the meta-analysis by Lee et\u00a0al. (2020) showed that servant leadership can also be efficiently exerted in cultures coined by higher power distance. Hence, the meaning of servant leadership might differ between countries, but this concept is, nevertheless, widely applicable across different contexts (Parris and Peachey 2013). Furthermore, servant leadership stands in contrast to traditional leadership practices, in that the leader is not the head of the command chain (Rosa-D\u00edaz et\u00a0 al. 2021), but puts the followers first (Beck 2014) and aims to primarily serve them instead of solely leading them (Sendjaya and Sarros 2002). Since servant leaders\u2019 main aspiration is serving other people, they, thereby, promote a sharing and caring climate among their followers (Greenleaf 2002), enable mutual trust building by prioritizing the followers needs\u2019 fulfilment (Schaubroeck et\u00a0al. 2011), and inspire them to exercise leadership responsibilities (Dean 2014; Ghasemy et\u00a0al. 2022a, b; Graham 1991). Hence, it is not only the leader who influences the followers, but also the followers who influence the leader (Eva et\u00a0al. 2019; Graham 1991)."

            "heading": "2.2 Organizational commitment",
            "text": "Commitment, as one of the widely studied classical concepts over a few decades, is a core component of an organization\u2019s life, which builds on met work expectations (DeCotiis and Summers 1987; Meyer and Allen 1991) and is usually described as being relatively stable and lasting (Gautam et\u00a0al. 2004; Porter et\u00a0al. 1974). In general, researchers distinguish between behavioral and attitudinal commitment (Coopey and Hartley 1991; Meyer and Allen 1991; Mowday et\u00a0 al. 1979). Behavioral commitment includes such behaviors\n1 3\nthat describe the employee\u2019s involvement in an organization beyond the limits of expected behaviors (DeCotiis and Summers 1987). Within the attitudinal approach, organizational commitment is a concept that describes an employee\u2019s identification with and involvement in their organizations (Porter et\u00a0al. 1974). Early on, organizational commitment was conceptualized as a one-dimensional construct (Mowday 1998).\nHowever, several research studies describe organizational commitment as being multidimensional in nature (Nazir et\u00a0al. 2016). The probably most used conceptualization of organizational commitment is the three-component model by Meyer and Allen (1991), who distinguished between affective, normative, and continuance commitment (Bashir and Gani 2020). Normative commitment includes feelings of obligation to stay with an organization, while continuance commitment considers the costs of leaving an organization and describes the need to remain with the company (Meyer and Allen 1991; Meyer and Smith 2000; Mowday 1998). Therein, normative commitment and continuance commitment are somewhat overlapping concepts (Mercurio 2015). Affective commitment is an affective orientation toward the organization and a desire to remain, which includes three facets, namely emotional attachment, identification, and involvement (Meyer and Allen 1991; Meyer and Smith 2000; Mowday 1998). The three-component approach combines attitudinal and behavioral aspects in a complementary way; hence, commitment can be better described as a psychological state (Mercurio 2015; Meyer and Allen 1991). Furthermore, the three components can all\u00a0be perceived at the same time (Meyer and Allen 1991) and are influenced by \u00a0human resouce management (HRM) policies and practices (Meyer and Smith 2000). Consequently, this concept receives a core position in human resource management research (Coopey and Hartley 1991). In our study, we focus on affective commitment as organizational commitment\u2019s core essence (Mercurio 2015)."

In the higher education context, there is a growing emphasis on performance, with a strong focus on the performance of academic units and individual academics (Kallio et\u00a0al. 2016; Manathunga et\u00a0al. 2017). More specifically, different aspects of performance in academic settings have been addressed, such as research performance and knowledge performance (e.g., Ponnuswamy and Manohar (2016)). In addition, in a recent comparative study in the context of Malaysian and Japanese higher education systems, Ghasemy et\u00a0al.\u00a0 (2022c) focused on different sustainability-related issues, such as Education for Sustainability (EfS) effective in-role performance with five dimensions that include\u00a0personal and interpersonal outcomes, learning and teaching outcomes, recognition and reputation, financial performance, and effective implementation. It is noteworthy that, due to the introduction of the New Public Management practices, university governance has applied performance management, as a means for output control, more sophisticatedly (Bleiklie and Lange 2010). The overarching objective is to motivate scholars in presetting goals and achieving high performance (Weiherl and Frost 2016). It is also widely acknowledged that, in order to become sustainable in economic turbulences, it is imperative for universities to increase their performance (Yaakub and Mohamed 2019). Nevertheless, there is evidence that private universities need strategic agility to realize superior organizational performance for future business sustainability\n1 3\n(Lyn Chan and Muthuveloo 2019). In our study, we focused on a generic conceptualization of job performance."

With respect to servant leadership, we employed the seven-item servant leadership scale (SL-7), which was developed and validated by Liden et\u00a0 al. (2015). This scale is one of the recommended scales by Eva et\u00a0al. (2019), due to its inclusion of creating value for the community and conceptual skills, as well as its easiness of application and parsimony, and has been used in other studies before (e.g., Sun et\u00a0al. (2019)). Given that the original items were formulated in the third-person voice, we rephrased the items to the firstperson voice. Based on our scale, the minimum score for servant leadership was 7, the mean score was 21, and the maximum score was 35. Next, we measured academics\u2019 affective commitment using the six-item scale constructed by Rhoades et\u00a0 al. (2001). We changed the term organization to institution for making the items consistent with the higher education context. Based on our instrument, the minimum affective commitment score was 6, the mean score was 18, and the maximum score was 30. Last, we used the seven-item scale of employee performance of in-role behavior (IRB) developed by Williams and Anderson (1991) to measure academics\u2019 job performance. Williams and Anderson (1991) extended the scale of in-role performance by O\u2019Reilly and Chatman (1986) with other items that recognized required and formal job behaviors. Of the items used, two had to be reverse-coded as indicated by Williams and Anderson (1991). The minimum score for job performance was 7, the mean score was 21, and the maximum score was 35.\nAge group was measured as an ordinal variable with seven categories (0 = 35 and below, 1 = 36\u201340, 2 = 41\u201345, 3 = 46\u201350, 4 = 51\u201355, 5 = 56\u201360, and 6 = 61 and above) and academic rank, as another ordinal variable, had four categories (0 = lecturer, 1 = senior lecturer, 2 = associate professor, and 3 = professor).Consistent with the discussions made by Rhemtulla et\u00a0al. (2012) and Byrne (2016), we considered age group with seven categories as a continuous variable with linear effects. We also considered academic rank as a continuous variable based on the discussions of Bentler and Chou (1987, p. 88), who argued that, for normally distributed categorical variables, \u201ccontinuous methods can be used with little worry when a variable has four or more categories\u201d. In our study, academic rank with four categories was normally distributed (p < 0.05) as evidenced by the ZSkewness = 0.971 and ZKurtosis = -1.56. Relatedly, as noted by Pasta (2009) and Williams (2020), it is usually safe to treat ordinal variables as continuous, even when the spacing is not equal across categories. These arguments provide us with more substantial support for treating age group and academic rank as continuous variables with linear effects.\n1 3"

Our study\u2019s population are academics employed in Malaysian public universities and polytechnics as well as private universities.\nThe Malaysian government implemented the first strict lockdown on 18th March 2020 and extended it three times until 12th May 2020 to prevent the Coronavirus from spreading. Since, at this time, the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic were unknown to everyone and this was the first lockdown implemented in Malaysia, we expected these measures to have a strong impact on and elicit a strong arousal in people, including academics. Consequently, we administered our instrument among academics via an online survey distribution platform in April 2020 (beginning of the lockdown) and received 707 responses of which, due to completeness rate, we considered 698 surveys suitable for further analyses. During the next two waves (June and August 2020), we distributed our survey among those 698 academics, who had sufficiently completed the survey earlier. Subsequently, we received 326 and 298 completed surveys. Due to subject attrition, we solely focused on the complete data collected from 220 academics in all three waves.1\nIn our sample of N = 220, 122 academics (55.5%) were female and 98 academics (44.5%) were male. 39 academics (17.7%) were single, 172 academics (78.2%) were married, and 9 academics (4.1%) preferred not to indicate their marital status. With respect to the administrative positions, 99 academics (45%) held university leadership/administrative positions (e.g., department head, dean, or director) and 121 academics (55%) did not hold leadership/administrative positions. In terms of academic rank, 55 academics (25%) were lecturers, 89 academics (40.5%) were senior lecturers, 43 academics (19.5%) were associate professors, and 33 academics (15%) were professors. Finally, the sampled academics\u2019 average age was 46.38 (SD = 8.92). It is important to highlight that leadership behaviors can be practiced by anyone; hence, academics (e.g., professors) without formal leadership/administrative positions can also be seen as leaders of academic organizations (Evans 2017)."

As the next step in data screening, we specified our unconditional multivariate LGC model and ran it to identify multivariate outliers and to assess the multivariate normality assumption. We detected 10 multivariate outliers in our data and removed them from our dataset. This decreased the normalized estimate of multivariate kurtosis (Mardia 1974) to 4.98.

Therefore, we removed the slope factor and re-estimated the model. The results showed that the mean (\u03b2 = \u2212 0.080, z = \u2212 0.961) and variance (\u03b6D2 = 0.147, zD2 = 0.366) of servant leadership\u2019s slope factor were not significant either.

These values were above the average scores obtained based on the instruments used to collect the data. In addition, the positive causal association between servant leadership and affective commitment (\u03b2 = 0.529) indicated that a one unit change in servant leadership was associated with a 0.529 unit change in affective commitment.

Turning to the residual variances section in Table\u00a01, we observed that all random measurement error variances of servant leadership and affective commitment were relatively homoscedastic or, in other words, consistent over time (Byrne and Crombie 2003). Also, due to a lack of change in servant leadership and affective commitment, we did not test the linearity of the growth trajectories since, technically, this is not an assumption, but rather a central testable hypothesis in LGC modeling (Preacher et\u00a0al. 2008)."

Our observation showed that age group was not a significant predictor of affective commitment (\u03b2 = 0.514, z = 1.630) either. In addition, the evaluation of the Lagrange Multiplier (LM) test results to identify misspecifications in the model showed that two error covariances, namely the covariances between affective commitment and servant leadership\u2019s residual variances at Time 1 and at Time 3, should be freely estimated. Consequently, we modified the model by removing the link between age group and affective commitment as well as adding the two meaningful error covariances. Moreover, due to the lack of evidence regarding change in servant leadership behavior and affective commitment, we specified a correlation between the residuals of affective commitment and servant leadership measured at Time 2, and imposed equality constraints on all the three specified residual covariances. We present the complete set of estimation results in Table\u00a02, which shows a very good fit of the model to the data, and a summarized version of the results in Fig.\u00a02.\nAs displayed in Table\u00a02, adding age, academic rank, and job performance to the model slightly changed the statistics. Specifically, controling for academic rank and age, servant leadership\u2019s mean value3 was \u00b5 = 28.360 and affective commitment\u2019s mean value4 was \u00b5 = 24.103. Regarding servant leadership\u2019s impact on affective commitment, we identified a significant causal relationship (\u03b2 = 0.429, z = 3.862), implying that the higher the level of servant leadership behavior, the higher the level of affective commitment. More specifically, our results showed that a one unit change in servant leadership behavior was associated with a 0.429 unit change in affective commitment. Focusing on our distal outcome (i.e., job performance measured at Time 3 with a mean5 of \u00b5 = 29.910), our results uncovered that, on average, a one unit change in servant leadership was associated with a 0.501 unit change in job performance and a one unit change in affective commitment was associated with a 0.156 unit change in our distal outcome. Moreover, all the mean scores were above the average scores obtained by our instruments. To test the indirect effect of servant leadership behavior on job performance through affective commitment, we performed a bootstrapping test with 1,000 subsamples. Our analysis uncovered that the indirect effect of interest (\u03b2 = 0.067, s.e. = 0.029, z = 2.295, standardized estimate = 0.053) was statistically significant. Given the significance of servant leadership\u2019s direct effect on job performance, we concluded that affective commitment partially mediated the relationship between the predictor and the outcome.\nWe also observed that academic rank\u2019s effect on affective commitment\u2019s intercept factor (\u03b2 = 0.792, z = 2.962) was positive and statistically significant, indicating that a one unit change in academic rank was associated with a 0.792 unit increase in affective commitment. Given the coding mechanism in academic rank, we concluded that professors\u2019 and lecturers\u2019 affective commitment were at the highest and the lowest level, respectively.\nOur analysis showed that the effect of age on servant leadership\u2019s intercept factor was positive and statistically significant (\u03b2 = 0.400, z = 3.876) as well. This highlighted that older academics were more successful in exhibiting servant leadership behaviors at the beginning of the lockdown (Time 1) than their younger counterparts. More specifically, a one unit change in age group was associated with a 0.400 unit of increment in the servant leadership score.\n3 The mean value of servant leadership = 27.308 + (2.629 \u00d7 0.400) = 28.360. 4 The mean value of affective commitment = (27.308 \u00d7 0.429) + 10.941 + (2.629 \u00d7 0.400 \u00d7 0.429) + (1.257 \u00d7 0.792) = 24.103. 5 The mean value of job p erf orm ance = (10.941 \u00d7 0.156) + (27.308 \u00d7 0.429 \u00d7 0.156) + 11.942 + (27.308 \u00d7 0.5 01) + (2.629 \u00d7 0.400 \u00d7 0.501) + (2.629 \u00d7 0.400 \u00d7 0.429 \u00d7 0.156) + (1.257 \u00d7 0.792 \u00d7 0.156) = 29.910.\n1 3\nWith respect to the error variances, our analysis uncovered that the factors\u2019 disturbance variances and all the observed variables\u2019 residual variances were statistically significant as well. Finally, regarding the covariances, we observed a relatively strong positive correlation between age group and academic rank (r = 0.556). In addition, we observed\nNote 1.

            "text": "The focus of our study lies on servant leadership, since, in addition to providing support, supplies, and resources, such leaders help employees grow and develop in their profession, while simultaneously encouraging them to independently manage their working processes (Stouten and Liden 2020). Specifically, we developed and verified a longitudinal model that defines the relationship between servant leadership, affective commitment, job performance, age, and academic rank during the Covid-19 pandemic in the Malaysian\u00a0higher education sector.\nIn our results, we did not observe change in servant leadership and affective commitment, indicating their stability over time. Possibly, this finding was related to the implemented Covid-19 policies, which successfully kept the mean score of affective commitment and servant leadership high (above the average scores obtained based on our instruments) and relatively stable. Examples of these policies and practices include sharing accurate information with stakeholders, timely decision-making, providing standard operating procedures for students and staff, and empowering deans and department heads to make operational decisions during the lockdown. Nevertheless, it might also be that organizational commitment, in general, is rather stable and lasting (Gautam et\u00a0al. 2004; Porter et\u00a0 al. 1974). Solinger et\u00a0 al. (2015) noted that especially a person\u2019s affective information related to attitudes changes more slowly than their cognitive or behavioral information. However, from a theoretical and empirical standpoint, there might also be other factors that could have prevented servant leadership and affective commitment from declining during our assessment.\nOverall, our findings confirm previous research, in that the model shows that servant leadership is a good driver for affective\u00a0 commitment (Aboramadan et\u00a0 al. 2020) and job performance (Liden et\u00a0al. 2014). Affective commitment\u2019s positive effect on job/in-role performance is also well in line with previous research (Lam and Liu 2014). Notably, these findings even hold during the Covid-19 pandemic. Also Mihalache and Mihalache (2022) noted that supervisor accessibility is one of the support forms that can help with uncertainty during the pandemic and increase affective commitment. Gray et\u00a0al. (2022, in press), however, noted that not all attempted support behavior is actually helpful and identified nine themes that should be considered for reasonable support during crises, namely autonomy, communication, changes, personal resources, safety, time, tone, work equipment, and workload.\nSpecifically, based on our final model, we observed that a one unit change in servant leadership was associated with a 0.429 unit of change in affective commitment and the standardized coefficient to represent this effect was 0.277. Also, the comparison of the standardized effects of servant leadership and affective commitment on job performance showed that servant leadership\u2019s effect on job performance (0.400) was two times larger than the one of affective commitment (0.193). In addition, we confirmed affective commitment\u2019s mediating role in the relationship between servant leadership behavior and job performance. Indeed, servant leaders put trust in their employees and empower them to\n1 3\ntake responsibility for their decisions, which, at the same time, holds employees accountable for their work efforts (Stouten and Liden 2020). Furthermore, Cipriano (2011) argued that in a collegial atmosphere in which lecturers trust and respect one another, those who are engaged in collaboration can deliver better performance than those who work in isolation. To tackle traditional challenges (e.g., effective staff, financial, and time management) (Ghasemy et\u00a0al. 2018) and pandemic-related challenges (e.g., ensuring the system\u2019s agility and resilience, transforming the educational environment, and exploring and identifying new digital opportunities), servant leadership behaviors might be the right choice. Therefore, policies in academic settings should focus on fostering and nurturing servant behaviors, such as empowering academics, encouraging academics to behave ethically, developing academics\u2019 conceptual skills, supporting academics in creating value for the community, and motivating the culture of helping others grow and succeed (Ghasemy et\u00a0al.\u00a02022b).\nWith respect to the residual covariances, and given the imposed equality constraints on these parameters, we observed relatively weak, but statistically significant correlations, between the residuals. This finding points towards situational factors that are not present in our model but could have influenced servant leadership behaviors and affective commitment during our assessment.\nMoreover, our model showed that age and academic rank were considerably related to one another (r = 0.557), which means that the older the lecturer, the higher the rank. This seems to be intuitive and expected. In addition, we found that age was a significant predictor of servant leadership and academic rank was a significant predictor of affective commitment. To compare the roles of the time-invariant covariates in our model, and considering the standardized estimates displayed in Fig.\u00a02, we observed that age group\u2019s effect on servant leadership (0.275) was larger than academic rank\u2019s effect on affective commitment (0.200). Given the positive association between academic rank and affective commitment\n1 3\nas well as between age and servant leadership, policies should focus on increasing junior and younger academics\u2019 affective commitment and servant leadership behaviors. Since young employees might lack experience, we recommend mentorship programs, which successfully improve young tenured professors\u2019 views on their working environment, have an impact on their research and funding activities (van der Weijden et\u00a0al. 2015), and support them in developing servant leadership behaviors (Beck 2014)."

            "text": "During unpredictable times, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, universities should witness and promote relevant and effective leadership behaviors. Practicing leadership behaviors is not confined to leaders and, in fact, anyone (e.g., academics) can exhibit such behaviors. Consequently, our study aimed at investigating the influence of academics\u2019 servant leadership behavior on their job performance directly, and indirectly via affective commitment. We designed a longitudinal study at three time points\u2014the beginning of the lockdown (April 2020), the end of the lockdown (June 2020), and two months after the lockdown (August 2020). Using data from the final sample of 210 academics and through LGC modeling, we found that (1) servant leadership and affective commitment were stable over time, (2) servant leadership was a driver of affective commitment and job performance in academic settings, (3) affective commitment partially mediated the relationship between servant leadership and job performance, (4) age\u2019s impact on servant leadership was higher than academic rank\u2019s effect on affective commitment, and (5) servant leadership\u2019s influence on job performance was higher than the one of affective commitment. We, thereby, contribute to research by providing evidence on servant leadership, affective commitment, and job performance in higher education, while considering age and academic rank as covariates as well as the Covid-19 pandemic\u2019s background.\nOur study is not without limitations. First, in this study, we only focused on job/in-role performance as our target construct. Therefore, we recommend researchers to consider other types of performance in academic settings as distal outcomes in their LGC models. Examples for other performance outcomes are knowledge performance and research performance (Ponnuswamy and Manohar 2016). Second, the correlations between the residual variances of servant leadership and affective commitment measured at Time 1, Time 2, and Time 3 indicate the presence of other factors that can positively influence servant leadership and affective commitment at the beginning, at the end, and two months after the end of a lockdown. Therefore, future research should focus on identifying those variables that are not included in our model. Third, we recommend repeating this study in later stages of the Covid-19 pandemic, when the Covid-19 pandemic is considered as being over, or in possible future crises. Therein, it would be a good opportunity to collect data at more than three meaningful assessment points, so that different shapes of change curves can be more easily studied. A related issue is the one of attrition in collecting longitudinal data (Grimm et\u00a0al. 2017). In general, treating uncollected data at each assessment point as missing completely at random (MCAR) is ordinarily a safe assumption, since such data are missing by design in a single group analysis (Preacher et\u00a0al. 2008). While the results of single group LGC modeling are highly similar to the results of the cohort sequential LGC design (Duncan et\u00a0al. 2006; Preacher et\u00a0al. 2008), we would like to recommend researchers to consider the accelerated or cohort sequential LGC design to address the issue of attrition in longitudinal studies. Last, with respect to analytical and methodological recommendations, we suggest\n1 3\ntesting other types of longitudinal theoretical models using the state of the art PLSe2 estimator (Bentler and Huang 2014; Ghasemy 2022; Ghasemy et\u00a0al. 2021b) or specifying and estimating LGC models in which the distal outcomes are conceptualized as latent factors (Bollen and Curran 2006)."
