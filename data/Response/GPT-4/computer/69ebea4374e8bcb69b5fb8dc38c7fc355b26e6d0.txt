Dynamic Competitive Facility Location Models: Explore models that dynamically adjust facility locations over time in response to changing market conditions, such as demographic shifts, technological advancements, and changes in consumer behavior. This could involve developing algorithms that allow for periodic reassessment and reallocation of facility locations to optimize market share in a more fluid economic landscape.

Integration of Real-Time Data and Machine Learning: Investigate the incorporation of real-time data analytics and machine learning techniques to predict changes in competitor behavior, consumer preferences, and market trends. This approach could enable more proactive and data-driven decisions in the selection of facility locations, improving the robustness and accuracy of predictions regarding future states of the world.

Sustainability and Social Impact Considerations: Extend the model to include sustainability criteria and social impact assessments in the decision-making process for facility location. This research could explore how environmental considerations and community impacts influence the optimal location strategy and how these factors can be integrated into existing decision rules to support more sustainable and socially responsible business practices.

Cross-Industry Application and Generalization: Apply the findings and methodologies developed in this paper to other industries and sectors beyond brick-and-mortar retail, such as healthcare, education, and digital services. This could involve tailoring the decision rules and optimization models to address the unique challenges and opportunities in these sectors, providing insights into the generalizability and adaptability of the approach.

Advanced Uncertainty Modelling Techniques: Develop more sophisticated models for representing and managing uncertainty, potentially incorporating Bayesian approaches or fuzzy logic. This research would aim to better capture the complexity and ambiguity of real-world scenarios, offering a more nuanced understanding of risk and enabling more informed decision-making under uncertainty.
