 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after reading the paper:

1. Develop more robust methods to handle the implicit semantic-level association of aspect categories. The paper notes challenges in distinguishing between closely related aspects like Substance and Soundness. New techniques could be explored to better capture the nuances between similar aspects. 

2. Explore transfer learning approaches to adapt models trained on product/service reviews to the peer review domain. Since peer reviews have unique characteristics, transferring knowledge from other review domains could help improve performance.

3. Incorporate reviewer and paper metadata to provide additional context. Information like reviewer expertise, paper topic area, etc. could help the model better understand the review text. 

4. Experiment with semi-supervised and weakly supervised approaches to reduce annotation requirements. The multi-aspect multi-label nature makes annotation costly, so methods like pseudo-labeling could help utilize unlabeled data.

5. Build an end-to-end system for conference chairs/editors to analyze peer reviews. This could include visualizations of aspect/sentiment analysis along with paper recommendation based on reviews. The paper mentions this as a potential application.
