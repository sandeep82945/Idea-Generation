    "abstractText": "To what extent does the structure of the players\u2019 strategy space influence the efficiency of decentralized solutions in congestion games? In this work, we investigate whether better performance are possible when restricting to load balancing games in which players can only choose among single resources. We consider three different solutions concepts, namely, approximate pure Nash equilibria, approximate one-round walks generated by selfish players aiming at minimizing their personal cost and approximate one-round walks generated by cooperative players aiming at minimizing the marginal increase in the sum of the players\u2019 personal costs. The last two concepts can be interpreted as solutions of greedy online algorithms for the related resource selection problem. We show that, under fairly general latency functions on the resources, better bounds cannot be achieved if players are either weighted or asymmetric. On the positive side, we prove that, under mild assumptions on the latency functions, improvements on the performance of approximate pure Nash equilibria are possible for load balancing games with weighted and symmetric players in the This work was partially supported by the Italian MIUR PRIN 2017 Project ALGADIMAR \u201cAlgorithms, Games, and Digital Markets\u201d.

            "heading": "1 Introduction",
            "text": "Congestion games [43] are non-cooperative games in which there is a set of selfish players competing for a set of resources, and each resource incurs a certain latency, expressed by a congestion-dependent function, to the players using it. Each player has a certain weight and an available set of strategies, where each strategy is a non-empty subset of resources, and aims at choosing a strategy minimizing her personal cost, which is defined as the sum of the latencies experienced on all the selected resources. We speak of weighted games/players when players have arbitrary non-negative weights and of unweighted games/players when all players have unitary weight.\nStable outcomes in this setting are pure Nash equilibria [41]: strategy profiles in which no player can lower her cost by unilaterally deviating to another strategy. However, they are demanding solution concepts, as they might not exist in weighted games [29] and, even when their existence is guaranteed, as, for instance, in unweighted games [43] or in weighted games with affine latency functions [29, 34], their computation might be an intractable problem [1, 26]. For such a reason, more relaxed solution concepts, such as -approximate pure Nash equilibria or -approximate one-round walks, are also considered in the literature. An -approximate pure Nash equilibrium is the relaxation of the concept of pure Nash equilibrium in which no player can lower her cost of a factor more than 1 + by unilaterally deviating to another strategy. Efficient algorithms computing approximate pure Nash equilibria in weighted congestion games with polynomial latency functions are known, see [18, 19, 27, 33]. An -approximate one-round walk is defined as a myopic process in which players arrive in an arbitrary order and, upon arrival, each of them has to make an irrevocably strategic choice aiming at approximatively minimizing a certain cost function. In this work, we shall consider two variants of this process: in the first, players choose a strategy approximatively minimizing, up to a factor of 1 + , their personal cost (selfish players), while, in the second, players choose the strategy approximatively minimizing, up to a factor of 1 + , the marginal increase in the social cost (cooperative players) which is defined as the sum of the players\u2019 personal costs (for the case of = 0, we use the term exact one-round walk). Approximate one-round walks can be interpreted as simple greedy online algorithms for the equivalent resource selection problem associated with a given congestion game, and, in most of the cases, these algorithms are optimal in the context of online optimization of load balancing\nproblems [17]. The worst-case efficiency of these solution concepts with respect to the optimal social cost is termed as the -approximate price of anarchy (for the case of pure Nash equilibria, the term price of anarchy [39] is adopted) and as the competitive ratio of -approximate one-round walks, respectively.\nInteresting special cases of congestion games are obtained by restricting the combinatorics of the players\u2019 strategy space. In symmetric congestion games, all players share the same set of strategies; in network congestion games the players\u2019 strategies are defined as paths in a given network; in matroid congestion games [1, 2], the strategy set of every player is given by the set of bases of a matroid defined over the set of available resources; in k-uniform matroid congestion games [35], each player can select any subset of cardinality k from a prescribed player-specific set of resources; in polytopal congestion games [36, 37], the strategies of every player correspond to binary vectors of a player-specific polytope; finally, in load balancing games, players can only choose single resources.\nTo what extent does the structure of the players\u2019 strategy space influence the efficiency of decentralized solutions in congestion games? In this work, we investigate whether better performance are possible when restricting to load balancing games. Previous work established that the price of anarchy does not improve when restricting to unweighted load balancing games with polynomial latency functions [20, 32], while better bounds are possible in unweighted symmetric load balancing games with fairly general latency functions [28]. Under the assumption of identical resources, improvements are also possible in the following cases: unweighted load balancing games with affine latencies [20, 45], unweighted games with polynomial or general latencies [42, 46], weighted symmetric load balancing games with affine latencies [40] or monomial latencies [30]. Finally, [7] proves that the price of anarchy does not improve when restricting to weighted symmetric load balancing games under polynomial latency functions. A summary of these known results is shown in Figure 1.\nFor the competitive ratio of exact one-round walks generated by cooperative players, no improvements are possible in unweighted load balancing games with\naffine latency functions [20, 45], while improved performance can be obtained under the additional assumption of identical resources [20] (we observe that, in this case, solutions generated by both types of players coincide); however, for weighted players, no improvements are possible even under the assumption of identical resources [17, 20]. A summary of these known results is shown in Figure 2. For one-round walks generated by selfish players, instead, no specialized limitations are currently known (except for those inherited by the case of cooperative players in games with identical resources).\n1.1 Our Contribution\nWe obtain an almost precise picture of the cases in which improved performance can be obtained in load balancing congestion games. This is done by either solving open problems or extending previously known results to both approximate solution concepts and more general latency functions encompassed within the following definitions.\nA class of latency functions C is closed under ordinate scaling (resp. abscissa scaling) if, for any function f \u2208 C and \u03b1 \u2265 0, the function g such that g(x) = \u03b1f(x) (resp. g(x) = f(\u03b1x)) belongs to C. A function f is semi-convex if xf(x) is convex, it is unbounded if limx\u2192\u221e f(x) =\u221e. We observe that the class of polynomial latency functions obeys the following properties:\n\u2022 it is both abscissa and ordinate scaling, \u2022 all of its functions are semi-convex, \u2022 all of its non-constant functions are unbounded.\nFor the approximate price of anarchy, we prove the following results, which are summarized in Figure 3. For unweighted players: if C is closed under ordinate scaling, the approximate price of anarchy does not improve when restricting to load balancing games (Theorem 3). For weighted players: if C is closed under abscissa and ordinate scaling, the approximate price of anarchy does not improve when restricting to load balancing games (Theorem 1). Furthermore, if C contains unbounded functions only (except for the eventual constant latency functions), the approximate price of anarchy does not improve even for symmetric load balancing games. However, under the additional hypothesis of identical resources, better performance are still possible. Let f be an increasing, continuous and semi-convex function. We prove that the approximate price of anarchy of weighted symmetric load balancing games with identical resources\nhaving latency function f is at most equal to\nsup x>0 max \u03bb\u2208(0,1) \u03bbxf(x) + (1\u2212 \u03bb)[x] ,ff([x] ,f ) (\u03bbx+ (1\u2212 \u03bb)[x] ,f )f(\u03bbx+ (1\u2212 \u03bb)[x] ,f ) ,\nwhere [x] ,f := inf{t \u2265 0 : f(x) \u2264 (1 + )f(x/2 + t)},\nand we show that such upper bound is tight under some mild assumptions. For the competitive ratio of approximate one-round walks, we prove the following results which are summarized in Figure 4. For unweighted players: if C is closed under ordinate scaling, the competitive ratio of approximate one-round walks generated by selfish players does not improve when restricting to load balancing games. The same negative result holds with respect to cooperative players under the additional hypothesis that all functions in C are semi-convex (Theorem 4). For weighted players: if C is closed under abscissa and ordinate scaling, the competitive ratio of approximate one-round walks generated by selfish players does not improve when restricting to load balancing games. Also in this case, to extend the result to cooperative players, we need that all functions in C are semi-convex (Theorem 2). Finally, for the case of identical resources, we design lower bounds on the performance of exact one-round walks in load balancing games with unweighted players.\nFrom a technical point of view, our results are obtained by designing some general load balancing instances parametrized by at most four numbers and two latency functions belonging to C. We show that there exists a choice of these parameters such that the performance of the considered load balancing instances, which thus get measured by some parametrized formulas, match that of general congestion games with latency functions in C. We also show how to quantitatively evaluate these formulas when C is the set of polynomial of maximum degree d.\nIndependently from our existential results, the load balancing instances we introduce may be useful to get good lower bounds on the performance of load balancing games with latency functions in C, even if we are not able to quantify the exact value of the metric adopted to measure the performance (see Remarks 3 and 5).\n1.2 Significance\nWith respect to the (approximate) price of anarchy, it can be appreciated how row 1 in Figure 3 generalizes to approximate equilibria and to more general latency functions row 1 in Figure 1. Similarly, rows 2 and 3 in Figure 3 generalize to approximate equilibria and to more general latency functions row 4 in Figure 1 (these issues were posed as open problems in [7]). Finally, row 4 in Figure 3 generalizes to approximate equilibria and to more general latency functions row 5 in Figure 1. Our negative results, together with the positive ones achieved by [28] (see row 2 of Figure 1), imply that, whenever resources are not identical, better bounds on the approximate price of anarchy are possible only when dealing with unweighted symmetric load balancing games.\nWe would like to stress the following observation here. Row 2 in Figure 3 may look redundant, as row 1 tells us that no improvement is possible in unweighted games if the latency functions are ordinate scaling, while, according to row 2, to have the same negative result in weighted games, we additionally need the abscissa scaling property. But, as unweighted games are also weighted ones, we have a representative subclass of weighted games for which no improvement is possible even under the mere assumption of the ordinate scaling property! This is true, but row 2 tells indeed something more than row 1. Everything gets clearer when thinking to what we mean when we say that no improvement is possible in weighted games: we mean that, for any game with n many players having weights defined by a vector (w1, . . . , wn), there exists a load balancing game with the same number of players and the same vector of weights with a non-smaller price of anarchy. So, the fact that this is true when considering a unitary vector of weights does not imply that this remains true for any vector, and in fact, to achieve such a stronger result, we have to assume the additionally hypothesis of abscissa scaling on the latency functions. Determining whether the same impossibility result can be obtained in weighted games by relying on the ordinate scaling property only is an interesting open problem. If this were not possible, it would follow that, in certain situations, restricting to singleton strategies is more effective in weighted games than it can be in unweighted ones.\nFor the competitive ratio of (approximate) one-round walks, we have that row 1 of Figure 4 provides the first known results for the case of selfish players. This has a number of applications. For instance, [9] showed that the upper bound on the competitive ratio of exact one-round walks involving selfish players provided in [24] for the case of affine latencies is tight. However, the\nlower bounding instance provided by [9] is a general congestion game, and the authors left as open problem of determining whether a load balancing games with the same performance could be achieved. Our findings show that this is possible and also tells us how to directly used to construct a load balancing instance whose performance matches that of general congestion games, thus solving this open question. Row 2 of Figure 4 generalizes row 1 of Figure 2, which holds only with respect to exact one-round walks generated by cooperative players in games with affine latency functions. Row 3 of Figure 4 implies that the upper bounds provided in [24] and [38] for the competitive ratio of exact one-round walks in general congestion games with affine and polynomial latency functions, respectively, are tight even for load balancing games. We stress out that, even for general congestion games, no lower bound for the competitive ratio of exact one-round walks involving selfish players was known prior to this work, except for the case of unweighted games with affine latencies [9].\nFinally, row 4 of Figure 4 generalizes results in [5, 17, 20] which hold only with respect to exact one-round walks for games with polynomial latency functions. Finally, the lower bounds that we obtain on the performance of exact one-round walks in load balancing games with unweighted players and identical resources improves and generalizes the previously known lower bound given in [20] which holds only for affine latency functions.\n1.3 Related Work\nThe price of anarchy in congestion games was first considered in [4] and [22] and shown to be equal to 5/2 in unweighted games with affine latency functions. In [22], it is also proved that no improved bounds are possible in both symmetric unweighted games and unweighted network games; these results were improved by [25] which shows that the price of anarchy stays the same even in symmetric unweighted network games. Furthermore, in [4], it is shown that the price of anarchy of weighted congestion games with affine latency functions is (3 + \u221a 5)/2.\nIn [20], it is shown that the previous bounds are tight also for load balancing games. For the special case of load balancing games on identical resources, the works of [45] and [20] show that the price of anarchy is 2.012067 for unweighted games and at least 5/2 for weighted ones. The works of [42, 46] generalize the above results on affine unweighted games with identical resources, and provide tight bounds on the price of anarchy even for polynomial and more general latencies. In [40], it is proved that, for symmetric load balancing games, the price of anarchy drops to 4/3 if the games are unweighted, and to 9/8 if the games are weighted with identical resources. This last result has been generalised by [30], who provide tight bounds on the price of anarchy of symmetric weighted load balancing games with identical resources and monomial latency functions. For symmetric unweighted k-uniform matroid congestion games with affine latency functions, [35] proves that the price of anarchy is at most 28/13 and at least\n1.343 for a sufficiently large value of k (for k = 5, it is roughly 1.3428). Tight bounds on the price of anarchy of either weighted and unweighted congestion games with polynomial latency functions have been given by [3]. Under fairly general latency functions, [28] shows that the price of anarchy of unweighted symmetric load balancing games coincides with that of non-atomic congestion games, while [7] proves that assuming symmetric strategies does not lead to improved bounds in unweighted games and gives exact bounds for the case of weighted players. It also shows that, for the case of weighted players, no improvements are possible even in symmetric load balancing games with monomial and polynomial latency functions. Upper and lower bounds on the pure and mixed price of anarchy for several classes of load balancing games with polynomial latency functions are provided in [30, 32, 31]. Finally, [23] (resp. [8]) provides tight bounds (resp. almost tight upper bounds) on the approximate price of anarchy of unweighted (resp. weighted) congestion games under affine latency functions. [33] obtain tight bounds on the approximate price of anarchy of congestion games with polynomial latency functions, holding even for load balancing games; prior to [33], analogue results have been obtained in the preliminary version of our work.\nThe competitive ratio of exact one-round walks generated by cooperative players in load balancing games with polynomial latency functions has been first considered in [5], where, for the special case of affine functions, an upper bound of 3 + 2 \u221a 2 is provided for weighted players. For unweighted players,\nthis result has been improved to 17/3 in [45], where it is also shown that, for identical resources, the upper bound drops to 2 + \u221a 5 in spite of a lower\nbound of 3.0833. Finally, [20] show matching lower bounds of 3 + 2 \u221a\n2 and 17/3 for, respectively, weighted and unweighted players. For weighted games with polynomial latency functions, tight bounds have been given in [17]; the lower bounds, in particular, hold even for identical resources, thus improving previous results from [5]. In [20] it is also shown that, for unweighted players and identical resources, the competitive ratio lies between 4 and 23 \u221a 21 + 1 if latency functions are affine.\nFor the case of selfish players and still under affine latency functions, [9, 24] show that the competitive ratio is 2 + \u221a 5 for unweighted congestion games,\nwhile, for weighted players, [24] gives an upper bound of 4 + 2 \u221a\n3. For the more general case of polynomial latency functions, [38] determines explicit and good upper bounds on the competitive ratio in unweighted and weighted congestion games; prior to [38], analogue results for weighted games with polynomial latency functions have been obtained in the preliminary version of our work [12].\nIn [13], it is shown that, if latency functions are polynomials of degree d and players are selfish, the (d+ 1)-th ordered Bell number is a lower-bound on the competitive ratio, even for unweighted games with identical resources. The concept of one-round walks starting from the empty state in non-atomic congestion games is analysed in [47]."

Given a class C of latency functions, let W(C) be the class of weighted congestion games, U(C) be the class of unweighted congestion games, ULB(C) be the class of unweighted load balancing games, WLB(C) be the class of weighted load balancing games, and WSLB(C) be the class of weighted symmetric load balancing games, all having latency functions in class C.\nLatency Functions. A congestion game has polynomial latencies of maximum degree d when, for each e \u2208 E, `e(x) = \u2211 h\u2208[d]0 \u03b1e,hx\nh, with \u03b1e,h \u2265 0 for each h \u2208 [d]0. When d = 0 we speak of constant latencies and when d = 1, we speak of affine latencies. If `e(x) = \u03b1e,dx\nd, we speak of monomial latencies of degree d, and if d = 1, we speak of linear latencies. Let P(d) denote the class of polynomial latencies of maximum degree d. A latency function f is semi-convex if xf(x) is convex, and it is unbounded if limx\u2192\u221e f(x) = \u221e. A congestion game has identical resources when all resources have the same latency. Given a class G of congestion games, let C(G) denote the class of latency functions of congestion games belonging to G. A class C of latency functions is closed under ordinate scaling (resp. abscissa scaling) if, for any function f \u2208 C and \u03b1 > 0, the function g such that g(x) = \u03b1f(x) (resp. g(x) = f(\u03b1x)) belongs to C.\n1 We have not adopted the classical notation used in asymptotic analysis for two main reasons: (i) to explicate that we evaluate the asymptotic behaviour with respect to a certain variable s only, while other variables/parameters are keep fixed; (ii) to avoid ambiguity with the symbol \u201co\u201d, that will be often used to denote other quantities.\n2 All the results obtained in this paper can be easily generalized to the case in which some latency function `e verifies `e(x) = 0 for some x > 0, but this requires further (tedious) case analysis to cope with undefined ratios of type c/0.\nStrategy Profiles and Cost Functions. A strategy profile is an n-tuple of strategies \u03c3 = (\u03c31, . . . , \u03c3n), that is, a state of the game in which each player i \u2208 N is adopting strategy \u03c3i \u2208 \u03a3i, so that \u03a3 := \u00d7i\u2208N\u03a3i denotes the set of strategy profiles which can be realized in CG. For a strategy profile \u03c3, the congestion of resource e \u2208 E in \u03c3, denoted as ke(\u03c3) := \u2211 i\u2208N :e\u2208\u03c3i wi, is the total weight of the players using resource e in \u03c3 (observe that, in unweighted games, ke(\u03c3) coincides with the number of users of e in \u03c3). The personal cost of player i in \u03c3 is defined as costi(\u03c3) = \u2211 e\u2208\u03c3i `e(ke(\u03c3)) and each player aims at minimizing it. For the sake of conciseness, when the strategy profile \u03c3 is clear from the context, we write ke in place of ke(\u03c3). Fix a strategy profile \u03c3 and a player i \u2208 N . We denote with \u03c3\u2212i the restriction of \u03c3 to all players other than i; moreover, for a strategy S \u2208 \u03a3i, we denote with (\u03c3\u2212i, S) the strategy profile obtained from \u03c3 when player i changes her strategy from \u03c3i to S, while the strategies of all the other players are kept fixed. The quality of a strategy profile in congestion games is measured by using the social function SUM(\u03c3) = \u2211 i\u2208N wicosti(\u03c3) = \u2211 e\u2208E ke(\u03c3)`e(ke(\u03c3)), that is, the sum of the players\u2019 personal costs. A social optimum is a strategy profile \u03c3\u2217 minimizing SUM. For the sake of conciseness, once a particular social optimum has been fixed, we write oe to denote the value ke(\u03c3 \u2217).\nSolution Concepts. For any \u2265 0, an -approximate pure Nash equilibrium is a strategy profile \u03c3 such that, for any player i \u2208 N and strategy S \u2208 \u03a3i, costi(\u03c3) \u2264 (1 + )costi(\u03c3\u2212i, S). For = 0, we speak of an (exact) pure Nash equilibrium. We denote by NE (CG) the set of -approximate pure Nash equilibria of a congestion game CG.\nFor any \u2265 0, an -approximate one-round walk is an online process in which players appear sequentially according to an arbitrary order and, upon arrival, each player irrevocably chooses a strategy approximatively minimizing a certain cost function. Formally, an -approximate one-round walk involving selfish (or cooperative) players is an n + 1-tuple \u03c4 = (\u03c30,\u03c31,\u03c32, . . . ,\u03c3n) defined as follows:\n\u2022 assuming without loss of generality that players enter sequentially according to their indices, \u03c3i = (\u03c3i1, \u03c3 i 2, . . . , \u03c3 i i , \u2205, \u2205, . . . , \u2205\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nn\u2212i\n) is the strategy profile\nobtained when the first i players have performed their strategic choice, while the remaining ones have not entered the game yet (so, we assume that each of them is playing the empty strategy); \u2022 if players are selfish, the i-th player aims at minimizing her personal cost, so that costi(\u03c3\ni) \u2264 (1 + ) minS\u2208\u03a3i costi(\u03c3i\u22121, S); otherwise, if players are cooperative, the i-th player aims at minimizing the marginal increase in the social function SUM, so that SUM(\u03c3i) \u2212 SUM(\u03c3i\u22121) \u2264 (1 + ) minS\u2208\u03a3i(SUM(\u03c3\ni\u22121, S)\u2212 SUM(\u03c3i\u22121))3. 3 An alternative definition for the concept of -approximate one-round walk involving cooperative players can be obtained by assuming that the i-th player aims at minimizing the value of the social function, i.e., SUM(\u03c3i) \u2264 (1 + ) minS\u2208\u03a3i SUM(\u03c3 i\u22121, S). For = 0 the\nFor = 0, we speak of a(n) (exact) one-round walk. We denote by ORWs (CG) (resp. ORWc (CG)) the set of strategy profiles \u03c3 = \u03c3\nn which can be constructed by an -approximate one-round walk involving selfish (resp. cooperative) players in a congestion game CG.\nQuality Metrics. The -approximate price of anarchy of a congestion game CG is defined as PoA (CG) = max\u03c3\u2208NE (CG) SUM(\u03c3) SUM(\u03c3\u2217) , where \u03c3 \u2217 is a social optimum for CG. Similarly, the competitive ratio of -approximate one-round walks generated by selfish (resp. cooperative) players, is defined as CRs (CG) = max\u03c3\u2208ORWs (CG) SUM(\u03c3) SUM(\u03c3\u2217) (resp. CR c (CG) = max\u03c3\u2208ORWc (CG) SUM(\u03c3) SUM(\u03c3\u2217) ). Given a class of congestion games G, the -approximate price of anarchy of G is defined as PoA (G) = supCG\u2208GPoA (CG). For the case of = 0, we refer to this metric simply as to the price of anarchy. The competitive ratio of -approximate oneround walks of G generated by both selfish and cooperative players is defined accordingly. Throughout the paper, we shall assume that, in any considered class of latency functions, there always exists a non-constant latency function.4"

            "text": "In this section, we show that, under mild assumptions on the latency functions, the -approximate price of anarchy and the competitive ratio of -approximate selfish/cooperative one-round walks of weighted congestion games cannot improve even when restricting to load balancing games.\n3.1 Preliminary Definitions and Technical Lemmas\nWe first give some definitions and two technical lemmas, whose proofs are based on the primal-dual method [8], and are deferred to Section B of the appendix (since they are quite technical and do not constitute the primary focus of this work). Lemma 1 gives quasi-explicit formulas to compute upper bounds for the considered efficiency metrics, and such bounds are obtained by fixing an arbitrary congestion game, and by exploiting the dual linear program of a parametric primal linear program whose objective function returns the value of the considered efficiency metric. Then, Lemma 2 provides some parameters that will be used in the main theorems of this section to design ad-hoc load balancing instances whose performance match the upper bounds of Lemma 1.\nWe point out that, the upper bounds provided in Lemma 1 can be equivalently derived by resorting to the smoothness framework [44] (further details are given in Section A of the appendix). Prior to this work, similar results as in\ntwo definitions are equivalent; for > 0, the proof arguments that we will consider in this paper can be easily adapted/modified to get similar results holding under this alternative definition.\n4 We observe that, if all the latency functions are constant, the value of all quality metrics is at most 1 + , and such upper bound is tight.\nLemma 2 have been given in [44, 7, 47], with the aim of designing parametric load balancing instances whose performance match the known upper bounds.\nGiven x \u2265 1, k > 0, o > 0, and a latency function f , let\n\u03b2W(EM, k, o, f) :=  \u2212kf(k) + (1 + )of(k + o) if EM = PoA , \u2212 \u222b k 0 f(t)dt + (1 + )of(k + o) if EM = CRs ,\n\u2212kf(k) + (1 + )((k + o)f(k + o)\u2212 kf(k)) if EM = CRc . (1)\nGiven EM \u2208 {PoA ,CRs ,CRc }, let\n\u03b3W(EM, x, k, o, f) := kf(k) + x \u00b7 \u03b2W(EM, k, o, f)\nof(o) ; (2)\nfurthermore, given a class of weighted congestion games G, let\n\u03b3W(EM,G) := inf x\u22651 sup f\u2208C(G),k>0,o>0 \u03b3W(EM, x, k, o, f). (3)\nLemma 1 Let G be a class of weighted congestion games. For any EM \u2208 {PoA ,CRs } we have that EM(G) \u2264 \u03b3W(EM,G). This fact holds for EM = CRc if the latency functions of C(G) are semi-convex. The proof of Lemma 1 is deferred to Section B of the appendix, and we give a brief overview of the case EM = PoA .\nProof (Sketch of the proof of Lemma 1) The maximum value of the following linear program in the variables \u03b1e\u2019s is an upper bound on PoA (CG) (recall that wi is the weight of player i, ke and oe are the equilibrium and optimal congestions of resource e, respectively):\nLP1 : max SUM(\u03c3)\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37\u2211 e\u2208E \u03b1eke`e(ke)\ns.t. \u2211 e\u2208\u03c3i \u03b1e`e(ke) \u2264 (1 + ) \u2211 e\u2208\u03c3\u2217i \u03b1e`e(ke + wi), \u2200i \u2208 N (4)\nSUM(\u03c3\u2217)\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37\u2211 e\u2208E \u03b1eoe`e(oe) = 1 (5) \u03b1e \u2265 0, \u2200e \u2208 E,\nIndeed, by setting \u03b1e = 1 for any e \u2208 E, we have that: (i) the objective function is the social cost at the equilibrium; (ii) the constraints in (4) impose some relaxed -approximate pure Nash equilibrium conditions (ensuring that each agent, at the equilibrium, does not get any benefit when deviating in favour of strategy \u03c3\u2217i ); (iii) (5) is the normalized optimal social cost (normalization is\npossible since there is some oe > 0, that implies oe`e(oe) > 0). We introduce further relaxations on LP1 (by replacing all the constraints in (4) with their weighted sum) and we get the following linear program:\nLP2 : max \u2211 e\u2208E \u03b1eke`e(ke)\ns.t. \u2211 e\u2208E\n\u03b1e\u03b2W(PoA , ke, oe, `e) \u2265 0\u2211 e\u2208E \u03b1eoe`e(oe) = 1 \u03b1e \u2265 0, \u2200e \u2208 E,\nwhere \u03b2W(PoA , ke, oe, `e) is defined in (1). By taking the dual of LP2, we get the following linear program:\nDLP : min \u03b3\ns.t. \u03b3 \u00b7 oe`e(oe) \u2265 ke`e(ke) + x \u00b7 \u03b2W(PoA , ke, oe, `e), \u2200e \u2208 E x \u2265 0, \u03b3 \u2208 R\nFinally, we show that there exists a feasible solution (x, \u03b3) of the dual that guarantees a value of at most \u03b3W(PoA ,G); by weak duality, this is an upper bound on the optimal value of LP, and then an upper bound on the -approximate price of anarchy. ut\nLemma 2 Let G be a class of weighted congestion games. For each M < \u03b3W(EM,G), with EM \u2208 {PoA ,CRs }, one of the following cases holds: \u2022 Case 1: there exists a non-constant latency function f \u2208 C(G) and two real\nnumbers k, o > 0 such that M < kf(k)of(o) and \u03b2W(EM, k, o, f) \u2265 0. \u2022 Case 2: there exist two latency functions f1, f2 \u2208 C(G) and four real\nnumbers k1, k2, o1, o2 > 0 such that M < \u03b11k1f1(k1)+\u03b12k2f2(k2) \u03b11o1f1(o1)+\u03b12o2f2(o2) , where \u03b11 := \u03b2W(EM, k2, o2, f2) > 0 and \u03b12 := \u2212\u03b2W(EM, k1, o1, f1) > 0; furthermore, if EM = PoA , f1 and f2 can be chosen as non-constant latency functions.\nThis fact holds for EM = CRc if the latency functions of C(G) are semi-convex.\nThe proof of Lemma 2 is quite technical and does not represent a fundamental result of such work, thus it is deferred to Section B of the appendix. Anyway, we give a sketch of the proof clarifying the main steps.\nProof (Sketch of the proof of Lemma 2) The claim of Lemma 2 is obtained by reversing the proof arguments of Lemma 1 as follows: (i) we start from the upper bound \u03b3W(EM,G) obtained in Lemma 1; (ii) we derive a linear program DLP similar as the dual program used in Lemma 1, but with two constraints only (except those that impose the non-negativity of the variables), and whose optimal value is higher than M ; (iii) the dual of DLP is similar to the linear program LP2 used in Lemma 1, but with two constraints and two variables,\nand has the same optimal value (higher than M) as in DLP (by strong duality); in particular, the new linear program is explicitly defined as follows:\nLP : max \u03b11k1f1(k1) + \u03b12k2f2(k2)\ns.t. \u03b11\u03b2W(EM, k1, k1, f1) + \u03b12\u03b2W(EM, k2, o2, f2) \u2265 0 \u03b11o1f1(o1) + \u03b12o2f2(o2) = 1\n\u03b11, \u03b12 \u2265 0;\n(iv) finally, the claim of Lemma 2 is obtained by characterizing the optimal solution of LP. ut\nRemark 1 By exploiting Lemma 2, given an arbitrary choice of the input parameters k, o, f (resp. k1, k2, o1, o2, f1, f2) such that \u03b2W(EM, k, o, f) \u2265 0 (resp. \u03b2W(EM, k2, o2, f2) > 0 and \u2212\u03b2W(EM, k1, o1, f1) > 0), we have that kf(k)of(o) (resp. \u03b11k1f1(k1)+\u03b12k2f2(k2)\u03b11o1f1(o1)+\u03b12o2f2(o2) ) is a lower bound on \u03b3W(EM,G); furthermore, by definition of \u03b3W(EM,G), we have that supf\u2208C(G),k,o>0 \u03b3W(EM, x, k, o, f) is an upper bound on \u03b3W(EM,G) for any x \u2265 1. Thus, if such upper bound (for a suitable choice of x) is equal to the former lower bound (for a suitable choice of the input parameters), we necessarily have that they are both equal to \u03b3W(EM,G).\nRemark 2 In Lemma 2, if C(G) is closed under abscissa and ordinate scaling, we can assume without loss of generality that oj = 1 for each j \u2208 [2] (remove index j if the first case of Lemma 2 is verified). Indeed, if it is not the case, let f\u0302j \u2208 C(G) be the latency function such that f\u0302j(k) := ojfj(ojk) for any k \u2265 0. If we consider tuple (kj/oj , 1, f\u0302j) in place of tuple (kj , oj , fj) for each j \u2208 [2], the claim of Lemma 2 follows as well. Analogously, if C(G) is closed under abscissa and ordinate scaling, the supremum appearing in the definition of \u03b3W(EM, C) does not decrease when assuming o = 1; thus, also Lemma 1 holds under this assumption.\nExample 1 To illustrate the claims of Theorem 1 and Lemma 2 with a concrete example, we consider the problem of evaluating the competitive ratio of exact one-round walks involving selfish players for affine weighted congestion games. Because of Theorem 1 and Remark 2, we get that:\n\u03b3W(CR s 0,P(1))\n= inf x\u22651 sup f\u2208P(1),k\u22650\n( kf(k) + x ( f(k + 1)\u2212 \u222b k 0 f(t)dt ))\n= inf x\u22651 sup \u03b10,\u03b11\u22650 k>0  \u2211 d\u2208{0,1} \u03b1dk d+1 + x  \u2211 d\u2208{0,1} \u03b1d(k + 1) d \u2212 \u2211 d\u2208{0,1} \u03b1d kd+1 d+ 1  = inf x\u22651 sup d\u2208{0,1},k>0 ( kd+1 + x ( (k + 1)d \u2212 k d+1 d+ 1 ))\n= min x>2 sup k>0\n( k2 + x ( k + 1\u2212 k 2\n2\n))\n\u2264 \u03b3 CRs0, x\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37 2 \u221a 3 + 6 3 , k\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37\u221a 3 + 3\u221a 3 , o\ufe37\ufe38\ufe38\ufe37 1 , f : f(t) = t  (6) = 2 \u221a 3 + 4\nthus obtaining the same upper bound of [24]. Relatively to Lemma 2, we have that the first case is verified. In particular, by setting k = \u221a 3+3\u221a 3 , o = 1 and f in such a way that f(t) = t for any t \u2265 0 (i.e. the parameters k, o, f used in (6)), we get that the second inequality of the first case of Lemma 2 is tight (i.e., \u03b2W(CR s , k, o, f) = 0), and kf(k) of(o) is equal to 2 \u221a 3 + 4. Thus, by Remark 1, we necessarily have that \u03b3W(CR s 0,P(1)) = 2 \u221a 3 + 4.\n3.2 Main Theorems\nIn the following theorem, we prove that, under mild assumptions on the latency functions, no improvements are possible for -approximate pure Nash equilibria even when restricting to load balancing games.\nTheorem 1 Let C be a class of latency functions that is closed under ordinate and abscissa scaling. Then, \u03b3W(PoA ,W(C)) = PoA (W(C)) = PoA (WLB(C)). If all latency functions of C (except for the constant ones) are unbounded, we get \u03b3W(PoA ,W(C)) = PoA (W(C)) = PoA (WSLB(C)).\nProof First of all, we consider the case in which all latency functions, except for the constant ones, are unbounded. Fix M < \u03b3W(PoA ,W(C)). In the proof, we will show that there exists a load balancing instance LB \u2208 WSLB(C) such that PoA (LB) > M . By Lemma 1, this will imply that M < PoA (LB) \u2264 PoA (W(C)) \u2264 \u03b3W(PoA ,W(C)), and by the arbitrariness of M < \u03b3W(PoA ,W(C)), this fact will show the claim. We make use of a multigraph, to represent a load balancing game together with two special strategy profiles. This multi-graph is denoted as load balancing graph, and is defined as follows: the nodes are all the resources in E, and each player is associated to a weighted edge (e1, e2, w), where {e1} is denoted as her first strategy, {e2} is her second strategy, and w is her weight. With a little abuse of notation, any load balancing graph will be also used to denote the corresponding load balancing game.\nIf Case 2 of Lemma 2 holds (with respect to C), let k1, k2, o1, o2, f1, f2, \u03b11 = \u03b2W(PoA , k2, o2, f2), \u03b12 = \u2212\u03b2W(PoA , k1, o1, f1) be the parameters considered in the claim of Lemma 2. By Lemma 2, f1 and f2 can be chosen among the nonconstant latencies of C, thus, by hypothesis, they are unbounded. Furthermore, by Remark 2, we can assume without loss of generality that o1 = o2 = 1.\nLet s, n \u2208 N be two arbitrary positive integers. Consider a load balancing graph LBs,n(k1, k2, f1, f2) yielded by a directed n-ary tree\n5, organized in 2s levels, numbered from 1 to 2s, and whose edges are oriented from the root to the leaves, with the addition of n self-loops on the nodes of level 2s. The weight wi of a player associated to an edge outgoing from a node at level i \u2208 [s] (resp. i \u2208 [2s]s+1) is equal to (k1/n)i (resp. (k1/n)s(k2/n)i\u2212s). For i, j \u2208 [2], define\n\u03b8i,j := fi(ki)\n(1 + )fj(kj + 1)\nand \u03b8i := \u03b8i,i. Each resource at level i has latency\ngi(x) :=  \u03b8i\u221211 f1 (( n k1 )i\u22121 x ) if i \u2208 [s], \u03b8s\u221211 \u03b81,2\u03b8 i\u2212s\u22121 2 f2 (( n k1 )s ( n k2 )i\u2212s\u22121 x ) otherwise.\nSee Figure 5 for an example. Let \u03c3s,n be the strategy profile in which all players select their first strategy. We have the following lemma:\nLemma 3 For any integer s \u2265 2, there exists n(s) \u2208 N, such that \u03c3s,n is an -approximate pure Nash equilibrium of LBs,n(k1, k2, f1, f2) for any n \u2265 n(s).\n5 With a little abuse of notation, the value of n considered in such load-balancing instance does not represent the total number of players, but the number of players selecting each resource when playing their first strategy.\nThe proof of the above lemma is deferred to Section B of the appendix, and we only give a sketch of the proof. We consider an arbitrary player whose first strategy is a resource from a generic level i. Since the game is symmetric, we have to check deviations to all possible strategies. We have that: (i) if i \u2208 [2s\u2212 1] and the player deviates in favour of a resource from level j = i+ 1, her cost decreases exactly of a factor 1+ ; (ii) if i \u2208 [2s] and the player deviates in favour of a resource from level j \u2264 i, her cost does not decrease; (iii) if i \u2208 [2s\u2212 2] and the player deviates in favour of a resource from level j > i+ 1, for any sufficiently large n, her cost does not decrease. In any case, the cost of the considered player, when she deviates, cannot decrease of a factor higher than 1 + , thus \u03c3s,n is a pure Nash equilibrium. In the appendix, we prove separately all the three cases.\nIn the remainder of the proof, with the aim of estimating the approximate price of anarchy of LBs,n(k1, k2, f1, f2), we compare the social value of the -pure Nash equilibrium \u03c3s,n, with that of the strategy profile \u03c3 \u2217 s,n in which all players select their second strategy. By exploiting the definition of \u03b11, \u03b12 given in Lemma 2, we necessarily get k1\u03b81 > 1 (from \u03b12 > 0) and k2\u03b82 < 1 (from \u03b11 > 0).

(10)\nBy using (8) and (10), inequalities k1\u03b81 > 1 and k2\u03b82 < 1, and the fact that \u03c3s,n is a pure Nash equilibrium of LBs,n(k1, k2, f1, f2) for any s and any sufficiently large n (by Lemma 3), we get\nsup s,n\u2208N PoA (LBs,n(k1, k2, f1, f2))\n\u2265 lim s\u2192\u221e lim n\u2192\u221e\nSUM(\u03c3s,n) SUM(\u03c3\u2217s,n)\n= lim s\u2192\u221e lim n\u2192\u221e\nSUM(\u03c3s,n)/(k1\u03b81) s\u22121 SUM(\u03c3\u2217s,n)/(k1\u03b81) s\u22121\n=\nk1\u03b81 k1\u03b81\u22121k1f1(k1) + k1\u03b81,2\n( 1\n1\u2212k2\u03b82\n) k2f2(k2)\nk1\u03b81 k1\u03b81\u22121f1(1) + k1\u03b81,2\n( 1\n1\u2212k2\u03b82\n) f2(1)\n6 The definition of [<]s(F (s)) has been given in the preliminaries, and substitutes the usual asymptotic notation.\n=\n( k1f1(k1)\nk1f1(k1)\u2212(1+ )f1(k1+1)\n) k1f1(k1) + ( k1f1(k1)\n(1+ )f2(k2+1)\u2212k2f2(k2) ) k2f2(k2)(\nk1f1(k1) k1f1(k1)\u2212(1+ )f1(k1+1)\n) f1(1) + ( k1f1(k1)\n(1+ )f2(k2+1)\u2212k2f2(k2)\n) f2(1)\n=\n( k1f1(k1)\n\u03b12\n) k1f1(k1) + ( k1f1(k1)\n\u03b11 ) k2f2(k2)(\nk1f1(k1) \u03b12\n) f1(1) + ( k1f1(k1)\n\u03b11\n) f2(1)\n= \u03b11k1f1(k1) + \u03b12k2f2(k2)\n\u03b11f1(1) + \u03b12f2(1)\n> M, (11)\nwhere (11) comes from Lemma 2. Thus, by (11), we can choose s and n in such a way that PoA (LBs,n(k1, k2, f1, f2)) > M , and this shows the claim when Case 2 of Lemma 2 holds.\nNow, suppose that Case 1 of Lemma 2 holds, and let k, o, f be the parameters considered in that case; as done previously, by Remark 2, we can assume without loss of generality that o = 1. The load balancing instance we consider here is LBs,n(k, k, f, f), and the strategy profile \u03c3s,n and \u03c3 \u2217 s,n are defined as in the previous part of the proof. To evaluate SUM(\u03c3s,n), observe that all equalities up to (7) hold. Therefore, by continuing from (7), we get\nSUM(\u03c3s,n) = 2skf(k)\nif \u03b2W(PoA , k, o, f) = 0 (since, in such case, we have k\u03b81 = k\u03b82 = 1) and\nSUM(\u03c3s,n) = 1\u2212\n( kf(k)\n(1+ )f(k+1) )2s 1\u2212 kf(k)(1+ )f(k+1) kf(k)\nif \u03b2W(PoA , k, o, f) > 0 (since now we have k\u03b81 = k\u03b82 < 1). Analogously, to evaluate SUM(\u03c3\u2217s,n), observe that all equalities up to (9) hold. Therefore, by continuing from (9) we get\nSUM(\u03c3\u2217s,n) = 2sf(1) + [\u2264]s(1)\nif \u03b2W(PoA , k, o, f) = 0, and\nSUM(\u03c3\u2217s,n) = 1\u2212\n( kf(k)\n(1+ )f(k+1) )2s 1\u2212 kf(k)(1+ )f(k+1) f(1)\u2212 f(1) + [<]s(1)\nif \u03b2W(PoA , k, o, f) > 0. Thus, again, we get\nsup s,n\u2208N PoA (LBs,n(k, k, f, f)) \u2265 lim s\u2192\u221e lim n\u2192\u221e\nSUM(\u03c3s,n) SUM(\u03c3\u2217s,n) \u2265 kf(k) f(1) > M,\nwhere the last inequality follows from Case 1 of Lemma 2. By exploiting the above inequality, we can choose s and n in such a way that\nPoA (LBs,n(k, k, f, f)) > M , and this shows the claim when Case 1 of Lemma 2\nholds. We conclude that the approximate price of anarchy does not improve when restricting to symmetric load balancing games, if all non-constant latency functions are unbounded.\nIf there is some non-constant latency function in C(G) that is not unbounded, we can consider a general (asymmetric) load balancing game based on the load balancing graph LBs,n(k1, k2, f1, f2) defined above with n = 1 (i.e., the load balancing graph is a directed path), but where each player can select among her first and second strategy only, and based on the parameters k1, k2, f1, f2 or k, f derived according to Lemma 2. Let \u03c3s,1 and \u03c3 \u2217 s,1 be the strategy profiles defined above (with n = 1). By using a similar proof as in Lemma 3, we have that \u03c3s,1 is an -approximate pure Nash equilibrium. Indeed, the unique deviation that must be analysed is when each player located at level i in \u03c3s,1 deviates in favour of a resource at level i + 1 (case (i) in the proof of the lemma), and showing that such deviation does not give any benefit to that player does not require the unboundedness of the latency functions. Finally, we can reuse the last part of the above proof to show that, for sufficiently large s, PoA (LBs,1(k1, k2, f1, f2)) > M . Thus, by the arbitrariness of M , we have \u03b3W(PoA ,W(C)) = PoA (W(C)) = PoA (WLB(C)) which shows the claim. ut Now, we prove that no improvements are possible for approximate one-round walks when restricting to load balancing games.\nTheorem 2 Let C be a class of latency functions that is closed under ordinate and abscissa scaling. Then, \u03b3W(CR s ,W(C)) = CRs (W(C)) = CRs (WLB(C)). If all functions in C are also semi-convex, we have that \u03b3W(CRc ,W(C)) = CRc (W(C)) = CRc (WLB(C)). Proof Fix M < \u03b3W(EM,W(C)), where EM \u2208 {CRs ,CRc } is the considered efficiency metric. As in Theorem 1, by Lemma 1, it is sufficient showing that there exists a load balancing game LB \u2208WLB(C) such its competitive ratio is at least M .\nWe start with the case of selfish players. Let k1, k2, f1, f2, \u03b11, \u03b12 (resp. k, o, f) be the parameters considered in Case 2 (resp. Case 1) of Lemma 2, but related to EM = CRs . For simplicity, in the following we set k1 = k2 = k, o1 = o2 = o, and f1 = f2 = f , if Case 1 of Lemma 2 holds. By Remark 2, we can assume without loss of generality that o1 = o2 = 1.\nAs in Theorem 1, we resort to a load-graph representation. In particular, we extend the load balancing graph LBs,n(k1, k2, f1, f2) defined in the proof of Theorem 1 as follows. Denote as i(v) the level of resource v. For each node u in the load balancing graph, consider an arbitrary enumeration of all the n outgoing edges of u. Since each node has a unique incoming edge, we denote by h(v) \u2208 [n] the label/position associated to the unique edge entering v in the given ordering, so that, for any node u, all the n edges of type (u, v) are associated to a label h(v) \u2208 [n].\nFor i, j \u2208 [2] and h \u2208 [n], define \u03b8i,j(h) := fi ( hki n ) (1 + )fj(kj + 1)\nand \u03b8i(h) := \u03b8i,i(h). Resource v has latency function\ngv(x) :=  f1(x) if i(v) = 1, \u03b81(h(v))Au\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 Av f1 (( n k1 )i(v)\u22121 x ) if i(v) \u2208 [s]2, \u03b81,2(h(v))Au\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 Av f2 (( n k1 )s x ) if i(v) = s+ 1,\n\u03b82(h(v))Au\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 Av f2\n(( n k1 )s ( n k2 )i(v)\u2212s\u22121 x ) if i(v) \u2208 [2s]s+2,\nwhere (u, v) denotes the unique incoming edge of v and Av is recursively defined on the basis of Au by setting Av = 1 for i(v) = 1, i.e., for v being the root of the tree. The weights of all players are defined as in Theorem 1.\nConsider the online process \u03c4s,n in which players enter the game in nonincreasing order of level (with respect to their first strategy) and, within the same level, players are processed in non-decreasing order of position; equivalently, if two players iu and iv have, as their first strategies, some resources u and v respectively, such that either i(u) > i(v), or i(u) = i(v) \u2227 h(u) < h(v), then player iu is processed before player iv in the online process \u03c4s,n. Let \u03c3s,n be strategy profile obtained at the end of the process, i.e., the strategy profile in which each player selects her first strategy. We have the following lemma:\nLemma 4 The online process \u03c4s,n is an -approximate one-round walk.\nThe above lemma can be shown as follows. Let z be an arbitrary player whose first strategy is at level i \u2208 [2s \u2212 1]; let u, v be the first and second strategy of z, respectively, and let h := h(v) be the position/label associated to resource v. By construction of the online process \u03c4s,n, we have that, when z enters the game, there are h \u2212 1 players of weight wi already assigned to resource u, and n players of weight wi+1 assigned to resource v. Let \u03c3 u s,n be the partial strategy profile obtained when z is processed according to \u03c4s,n (i.e., only players preceding z have been already assigned), and z is assigned to her first strategy u; let \u03c3vs,n be the partial strategy profile in which z, instead, is assigned to her second strategy v. As our choice of player z has been arbitrary, it is sufficient proving that costz(\u03c3 u s,n) \u2264 (1 + )costz(\u03c3vs,n) to show that \u03c4s,n is an -approximate one-round walk. By using the recursive definitions of the latency functions gi and gi+1 (involving the quantities Au and Av, respectively), and by using a similar approach as in case (i) of Lemma 3, one can easily show that costz(\u03c3 u s,n) = gu(h \u00b7 wi) = (1 + )gv(n \u00b7 wi+1 + wi) = (1 + )costz(\u03c3vs,n), thus showing the claim of Lemma 4. Now, let \u03c3\u2217s,n be the strategy profile in which all players select their second strategy. In the remainder of the proof, with the aim of estimating the competitive ratio of LBs,n(k1, k2, f1, f2), we compare the social value of the strategy profile \u03c3s,n resulting from the -approximate one-round walk \u03c4s,n with that\nof strategy profile \u03c3\u2217s,n. For i, j \u2208 [2], let \u03bei,j denote quantity \u222b k t=0 fi(t)dt\n(1+ )fj(kj+1) , let\n\u03bei := \u03bei,i, and let SUMi(\u03c3s,n) denote the weighted total latency in \u03c3s,n of all the resources at level i \u2208 [2s]. We have that\nSUMi(\u03c3s,n) = \u2211\nv in level i\nkv(\u03c3s,n)gv (kv(\u03c3s,n))\n= \u2211\n(h1,h2,...,hi\u22121)\u2208[n]i\u22121 n \u00b7\nwi\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37( k1 n )i(i\u22121\u220f t=1 \u03b81(ht) ) f1(k1)\n= ki1 ni\u22121 ( n\u2211 h=1 \u03b81(h) )i\u22121 f1(k1)\n= ( n\u2211 h=1 \u03b81(h) k1 n )i\u22121 k1f1(k1)\n= ( n\u2211 h=1\nfi ( hk1 n ) (1 + )fj(k1 + 1) ( k1 n ))i\u22121 k1f1(k1)\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192n\u2192\u221e ( \u222b k t=0 f1(t)dt\n(1 + )f1(k1 + 1)\n)i\u22121 k1f1(k1)\n= \u03bei\u221211 k1f1(k1) (12)\nif i \u2208 [s], and (by using similar arguments) SUMi(\u03c3s,n)\n= ( n\u2211 h=1 \u03b81(h) k1 n )s\u22121( n\u2211 h=1 \u03b81,2(h) k1 n )( n\u2211 h=1 \u03b82(h) k2 n )i\u22121\u2212s k2f2(k2)\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192n\u2192\u221e \u03bes\u221211 \u00b7 \u03be1,2 \u00b7 \u03bei\u22121\u2212s2 k2f2(k2), (13) if i \u2208 [2s]s+1. Now, for any fixed s \u2265 2, we can compute limn\u2192\u221e SUM(\u03c3s,n). If Case 2 of Lemma 2 holds, we have that \u03be1 > 0 and \u03be2 < 0. Thus, by using similar arguments as in Theorem 1 (in particular, as in equality (8)), and by using (12) and (13), we get\nlim n\u2192\u221e SUM(\u03c3s,n) = lim n\u2192\u221e 2s\u2211 i=1 SUMi(\u03c3s,n)\n= s\u22121\u2211 i=0 \u03bei1k1f1(k1) + \u03be s\u22121 1 \u00b7 \u03be1,2 s\u22121\u2211 i=0 \u03bei2k2f2(k2)\n= ( \u03bes1 \u2212 1 \u03be1 \u2212 1 ) k1f1(k1) + \u03be s\u22121 1 \u03be1,2 ( 1\u2212 \u03bes2 1\u2212 \u03be2 ) k2f2(k2);\nanalogously, if Case 1 of Lemma 2 holds, we have that limn\u2192\u221e SUM(\u03c3s,n) = 2skf(k) if \u03b2W(CR s , k, o, f) = 0 (as \u03be1 = \u03be2 = 1), and limn\u2192\u221e SUM(\u03c3s,n) = 1\u2212\u03bes1 1\u2212\u03be1 kf(k) if \u03b2W(CR s , k, o, f) > 0 (as \u03be1 = \u03be2 < 1).\nBy using analogous steps as in (12) and (13), one can show that the weighted total latency SUMi(\u03c3 \u2217 s,n) in \u03c3 \u2217 s,n of resources at level i \u2208 [2s \u2212 1]2 can be obtained by replacing each kjfj(kj) with fj(1) in (12) and (13) and, analogously to Theorem 1, one can also compute SUM(\u03c3\u2217s,n), that is\nequal to \u22112s\u22121 i=2 SUMi(\u03c3 \u2217 s,n) + [<]s (\u22112s\u22121 i=2 SUMi(\u03c3 \u2217 s,n) ) (as in Theorem 1, the\ncontribution of resources at level 1 and 2s to the social cost is not significant). At this point, by using the same proof arguments of Theorem 1 (in particular, as in (11)), we get\nlim s\u2192\u221e lim n\u2192\u221e CRs (LBs,n(k1, k2, f1, f2)) \u2265 lim s\u2192\u221e lim n\u2192\u221e\nSUM(\u03c3s,n) SUM(\u03c3\u2217s,n)\n\u2265 \u03b11k1f1(k1) + \u03b12k2f2(k2) \u03b11f1(1) + \u03b12f2(1)\n> M,\nwhere the last inequality comes from Lemma 2. Thus, the claim holds for the case of selfish players.\nFor cooperative players, let k1, k2, o1, o2, f1, f2, \u03b11, \u03b12 as in Lemma 2 (remove index j \u2208 [2] and set \u03b1 = 1 if Case 1 of Lemma 2 is verified). By Remark 2, we assume without loss of generality that o1 = o2 = 1. Consider a load balancing graph LBs,n(k1, k2, f1, f2) as that defined above, but with n = 1 and \u03b8i,j(1) := fi(ki)\n(1+ )((kj+1)fj(kj+1)\u2212kjfj(kj)) . Let \u03c3s,1, \u03c4s,1, and \u03c3 \u2217 s,1 be\ndefined as in the case of selfish players (with n = 1). Similarly as in the case of selfish players, one can show that \u03c4s,1 is an -approximate one-round walk (involving cooperative players) that generates strategy profile \u03c3s,1, and we can show again that\nlim s\u2192\u221e lim n\u2192\u221e CRc (LBs,n(k1, k2, f1, f2)) \u2265 lim s\u2192\u221e lim n\u2192\u221e\nSUM(\u03c3s,n) SUM(\u03c3\u2217s,n)\n\u2265 \u03b11k1f1(k1) + \u03b12k2f2(k2) \u03b11f1(1) + \u03b12f2(1)\n> M ;\nthis shows that CRc (LBs,1(k1, k2, f1, f2)) > M for a sufficiently large s, and the claim follows. ut\nRemark 3 Fix a metric EM \u2208 {PoA ,CRs ,CRc }, a class of latency functions C, and let (k1, k2, o1, o2, f1, f2) (resp. (k, o, f)) be a tuple such that values \u03b11, \u03b12 considered in Case 2 of Lemma 2 are positive (resp. such that the inequality of Case 1 corresponding to the considered metric EM is satisfied, i.e., \u03b2W(EM, k, o, f) \u2265 0). By Remark 2, we assume without loss of generality that o1 = o2 = 1 (resp. o = 1). By inspecting the proofs of Theorem 1 and 2, we observe that the set of load balancing instances of type LBs,n(k1, k2, f1, f2) (resp. LBs,n(k, k, f, f)) guarantees a performance of at least \u03b11k1f1(k1)+\u03b12k2f2(k2)\n\u03b11f(1)+\u03b12f(2) (resp.\nkf(k) f(1) ) under the considered metric EM. Thus, in the case we are not able to\nquantify the exact value of \u03b3W(EM,W(C)), we can still find a tuple (k1, k2, f1, f2) (resp. (k, f)) that leads to good (and possibly tight) lower bounds; furthermore, the tightness can be shown by resorting to the characterization provided in Remark 1.\n3.3 Application to Polynomial Latency Functions\nConsider the class P(d) of polynomials with non-negative coefficients and maximum degree d. By Lemma 1, \u03b3W(EM,W(P(d))) is an upper bound on the efficiency metrics EM \u2208 {PoA ,CRs ,CRc } for weighted congestion games and load balancing games with polynomial latency functions of maximum degree d.\nBy exploiting the definition of \u03b3W(EM,W(P(d))) given at the beginning of this section, and by applying to these definitions similar arguments as those used in [3, 24] we can compute the exact value of \u03b3W(EM,W(P(d))) for any EM \u2208 {PoA ,CRs ,CRc }7. In particular, we have that \u03b3W(EM,W(P(d))) is equal to (\u03d5 ,d) d , where \u03d5 ,d is defined as the unique solution k \u2265 0 of equation \u2212kd+1+(1+ )(k+1)d = 0 if EM = PoA , of equation \u2212k d+1\nd+1 +(1+ )(k+1) d = 0\nif EM = CRs , and of equation \u2212(2+ )kd+1 +(1+ )(k+1)d+1 = 0 if EM = CRc . Some of the above upper bounds have already appeared in works based on the study of congestion games. \u03b3W(PoA ,W(P(d))) has been already evaluated in [3, 23]. The bounds related to the -approximate one-walks generated by selfish players generalize the results obtained in [24], in which the same bounds have been shown for affine latency functions and = 0, only; for more general polynomial latency functions and = 0, the bounds related to the -approximate one-walks have been re-obtained and shown in more detail in [38], subsequently to the preliminary version of our work.\nFinally, for = 0 and general polynomial latencies, the bounds related to cooperative players can be equivalently derived from the analysis provided in [16], in which the greedy algorithm has been applied to minimize the Lp norm in load balancing problems.\nA way to interpret the above tight bounds is provided by Remark 1. In particular, one can show that the exact value of \u03b3W(EM,W(P(d))) is attained by kf(k)f(1) , where f is the monomial function defined as f(t) = t\nd for any t \u2265 0, and k is the unique value satisfying constraint \u03b2W(EM, k, 1, f) \u2265 0 at equality.\nSince the class of polynomial latency functions P(d) satisfies the hypothesis of Theorem 1 and 2, as a corollary we have that the values \u03b3W(EM,W(P(d))) considered above are tight bounds on the performance of load balancing\n7 In [3, 24], the upper bounds on the performance of congestion games have been represented in terms of smoothness inequalities (see Section A of the appendix), but can be easily rewritten in terms of the upper bound \u03b3W(EM,W(P(d))). Thus, since the exact quantification of \u03b3W(EM,W(P(d))) relies on results and/or proof arguments already appeared, we omit the mathematical analysis and we give the final numerical values. Furthermore, we point out that the main focus of this subsection is not computing \u03b3W(EM,W(P(d))), but applying Theorem 1 and 2 to provide tight bounds on the performance of load balancing games with polynomial latency functions.\ninstances, and even of symmetric load balancing instances if the efficiency metric is the -price of anarchy. Thus, for polynomial latency functions, the performance does not improve when assuming singleton strategies. Furthermore, our findings can be used to close the gap between upper and lower bounds on the competitive ratio of exact one-round walks generated by selfish players, for congestion games with affine latency functions. Indeed, [24] showed that \u03b3W(CR s 0,W(P(1))) = 2 \u221a 3 + 4 \u2248 7.464 is an upper bound, and [9] provided a\nlower bound of 2 + \u221a\n5 \u2248 4.236 (holding even for unweighted congestion games); closing the above gap has been left as an open question. Our results directly imply that the upper bound \u2248 7.464 provided by [24] is tight, even for load balancing games. See Table 6 for some numerical comparisons."

            "text": "In this section, we show that, under mild assumptions on the latency functions, the -approximate price of anarchy and the competitive ratio of selfish or cooperative -approximate one-round walks in unweighted congestion games cannot improve even when restricting to load balancing games.\n4.1 Preliminary Definitions and Technical Lemmas\nSimilarly as in Section 3, we start by providing some definitions and two technical lemmas (Lemmas 5 and 6), which are variants of Lemmas 1 and 2, but applied to unweighted games. We omit the proofs of such lemmas, since they can be obtained by using the same proof arguments as in Lemmas 1 and 2, with the only difference that the weights are unitary and the congestions are integers. For completeness, we give a sketch of the proofs in the appendix.\nGiven x \u2265 1, k \u2208 Z\u22650, o \u2208 N, and a latency function f , let\n\u03b2U(EM, k, o, f) :=  \u2212kf(k) + (1 + )of(k + 1) if EM = PoA , \u2212\u2211kh=1 f(h) + (1 + )of(k + 1) if EM = CRs , \u2212kf(k) + (1 + )((k + 1)f(k + 1)\u2212 kf(k)) if EM = CRc .\n(14) Given EM \u2208 {PoA ,CRs ,CRc }, let\n\u03b3U(EM, x, k, o, f) := kf(k) + x \u00b7 \u03b2U(EM, k, o, f)\nof(o) ; (15)\nfurthermore, given a class of unweighted congestion games G, let\n\u03b3U(EM,G) := inf x\u22651 sup f\u2208C(G),k\u2208Z\u22650,o\u2208N \u03b3U(EM, x, k, o, f). (16)\nLemma 5 Let G be a class of unweighted congestion games. For any EM \u2208 {PoA ,CRs }, we have that EM(G) \u2264 \u03b3U(EM,G). This fact holds for EM = CRc if the latency functions of C(G) are semi-convex.\nLemma 6 Let G be a class of unweighted congestion games. For each M < \u03b3U(EM,G), with EM \u2208 {PoA ,CRs }, one of the following cases holds: \u2022 Case 1: there exist a latency function f \u2208 C(G) and two integers k, o > 0\nsuch that M < kf(k)of(o) and \u03b2U(EM, k, o, f) \u2265 0. \u2022 Case 2: there exist two latency functions f1, f2 \u2208 C(G) and four integers k1 > 0, k2 \u2265 0, o1 > 0, o2 > 0 such that M < \u03b11k1f1(k1)+\u03b12k2f2(k2)\u03b11o1f1(o1)+\u03b12o2f2(o2) , where \u03b11 := \u03b2U(EM, k2, o2, f2) > 0 and \u03b12 := \u2212\u03b2U(EM, k1, o1, f1) > 0.\nThis fact holds for EM = CRc if the latency functions of C(G) are semi-convex.\nRemark 4 By exploiting Lemma 5, given an arbitrary choice of the input parameters k, o, f (resp. k1, k2, o1, o2, f1, f2) such that \u03b2U(EM, k, o, f) \u2265 0 (resp. \u03b2U(EM, k2, o2, f2) > 0 and \u2212\u03b2U(EM, k1, o1, f1) > 0), we have that kf(k)of(o) (resp. \u03b11k1f1(k1)+\u03b12k2f2(k2)\u03b11o1f1(o1)+\u03b12o2f2(o2) ) is a lower bound on \u03b3U(EM,G); furthermore, by definition of \u03b3U(EM,G), we have that supf\u2208C(G),k\u2208Z\u22650,o\u2208N \u03b3U(EM, x, k, o, f) is an upper bound on \u03b3U(EM,G) for any x \u2265 1. Thus, if such upper bound (for a suitable choice of x) is equal to the former lower bound (for a suitable choice of the input parameters), we necessarily have that they are both equal to \u03b3U(EM,G).\n4.2 Main Theorems\nIn the following theorem, we prove that, under mild assumptions on the latency functions, no improvements are possible for -approximate pure Nash equilibria when restricting to load balancing games.\nTheorem 3 Let C be a class of latency functions that is closed under ordinate scaling. Then \u03b3U(PoA ,U(C)) = PoA (U(C)) = PoA (ULB(C)).\nProof Fix M < \u03b3U(PoA ,U(C)). Similarly as in Theorem 1, we will show that there exists a load balancing instance LB \u2208 ULB(C) such that PoA (LB) > M . By Lemma 5, this will imply that M < PoA (LB) \u2264 PoA (U(C)) \u2264 \u03b3U(PoA ,U(C)), and by the arbitrariness of M < \u03b3U(PoA ,U(C)), this fact will show the claim.\nSuppose that Case 2 of Lemma 6 is verified, and let k1, k2, o1, o2, f1, f2, \u03b11, \u03b12 be defined as in Lemma 6. As in Theorem 1, we resort to a load balancing graph representation. Consider a load balancing game defined by a multi-partite directed graph LBs(k1, k2, o1, o2, f1, f2) as load balancing graph, organized in 2s levels, numbered from 1 to 2s, and defined as follows. For each i \u2208 [s] (resp. i \u2208 [2s]s+1), there are os\u2212i1 ki\u221211 os2 (resp. o2s\u2212i2 ki\u2212s\u221212 ks1) nodes/resources. Edges can only connect nodes of consecutive levels, except for nodes at level 2s, each of which has k2 self-loops. The out-degree of each node at level i \u2208 [s] (resp. i \u2208 [2s]s+1) is k1 (resp. k2), and the in-degree of each node at level i \u2208 [s]2 (resp. i \u2208 [2s]s+1 without considering self-loops) is o1 (resp. o2); observe that this configuration can be realized since the total number of nodes at level i \u2208 [s\u2212 1] (resp. i = s, resp. i \u2208 [2s\u2212 1]s+1) multiplied by k1 (resp. k1, resp. k2) is equal to the number of nodes at level i+ 1 multiplied by o1 (resp. o2, resp. o2). See the example depicted in Figure 7. For i, j \u2208 [2], define \u03b8i,j := fi(ki)(1+ )fj(kj+1) and \u03b8i := \u03b8i,i. Each resource at level i has latency function gi(x) := \u03b8 i\u22121 1 f1 (x) if i \u2208 [s], and gi(x) := \u03b8s\u221211 \u03b81,2\u03b8i\u2212s\u221212 f2 (x) otherwise. We assume that each player can only choose among her first and her second strategy, and let \u03c3s and \u03c3\u2217s be the strategy profiles in which all players select their first and second strategy, respectively. Analogously to Theorem 1, one can show that \u03c3s is an -approximate pure Nash equilibrium.\nIn the remainder of the proof, with the aim at estimating the approximate price of anarchy of LBs(k1, k2, o1, o2, f1, f2), we compare the social value of the -pure Nash equilibrium \u03c3s, with that of the strategy profile \u03c3 \u2217 s in which all players select their second strategy. By exploiting similar arguments as in Theorem 1, we get\nSUM(\u03c3s)\n= s\u2211 i=1 ( os\u2212i1 k i\u22121 1 o s 2 ) k1gi(k1) + 2s\u2211 i=s+1 ( o2s\u2212i2 k i\u2212s\u22121 2 k s 1 ) k2gi(k2)\n= s\u2211 i=1 ( os\u2212i1 k i\u22121 1 o s 2 ) k1\u03b8 i\u22121 1 f1(k1)\n+ 2s\u2211 i=s+1 ( o2s\u2212i2 k i\u2212s\u22121 2 k s 1 ) k2\u03b8 s\u22121 1 \u03b81,2\u03b8 i\u2212s\u22121 2 f2(k2)\n= s\u2211 i=1 os\u221211 o s 2 ( k1\u03b81 o1 )i\u22121 k1f1(k1)\n+ 2s\u2211 i=s+1 os\u221211 o s 2 ( k1\u03b81 o1 )s\u22121 k1\u03b81,2 o2 ( k2\u03b82 o2 )i\u2212s\u22121 k2f2(k2)\n= os\u221211 o s 2 s\u22121\u2211 i=0 ( k1\u03b81 o1 )i k1f1(k1)\n+ os\u221211 o s 2 ( k1\u03b81 o1 )s\u22121 k1\u03b81,2 o2 s\u22121\u2211 i=0 ( k2\u03b82 o2 )i k2f2(k2) (17)\n= os\u221211 o s 2\n ( k1\u03b81 o1 )s \u2212 1\nk1\u03b81 o1 \u2212 1  k1f1(k1) + os\u221211 o s 2 ( k1\u03b81 o1 )s\u22121 k1\u03b81,2 o2 1\u2212 ( k2\u03b82 o2 )s 1\u2212 k2\u03b82o2\n k2f2(k2), (18) and\nSUM(\u03c3\u2217s )\n= s\u2211 i=2 ( os\u2212i1 k i\u22121 1 o s 2 ) o1gi(o1) + 2s\u22121\u2211 i=s+1 ( o2s\u2212i2 k i\u2212s\u22121 2 k s 1 ) o2gi(o2)\n+ ( ks\u221212 k s 1 ) (k2 + oe)g2s(k2 + o2)\n= s\u2211 i=2 ( os\u2212i1 k i\u22121 1 o s 2 ) o1\u03b8 i\u22121 1 f1(o1)\n+ 2s\u22121\u2211 i=s+1 ( o2s\u2212i2 k i\u2212s\u22121 2 k s 1 ) o2\u03b8 s\u22121 1 \u03b81,2\u03b8 i\u2212s\u22121 2 f2(o2)\n+ ( ks\u221212 k s 1 ) (k2 + oe)\u03b8 s\u22121 1 \u03b81,2\u03b8 s\u22121 2 f2(k2 + o2) (19)\n= os\u221211 o s 2 s\u2211 i=1 ( k1\u03b81 o1 )i\u22121 o1f1(o1)\u2212 [<]s\n( os\u221211 o s 2 ( k1\u03b81 o1 )s\u22121)\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37( os\u221211 o s 2 ) o1f1(o1)\n+ os\u221211 o s 2 2s\u22121\u2211 i=s+1 ( k1\u03b81 o1 )s\u22121 k1\u03b81,2 o2 ( k2\u03b82 o2 )i\u2212s\u22121 o2f2(o2)\n+\n[<]s ( os\u221211 o s 2 ( k1\u03b81 o1 )s\u22121)\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37 os\u221211 o s 2 ( k1\u03b81 o1 )s\u22121 k1\u03b81,2 o2 ( k2\u03b82 o2 )s\u22121 (k2 + oe)f2(k2 + oe)\n= os\u221211 o s 2 s\u22121\u2211 i=0 ( k1\u03b81 o1 )i o1f1(o1)\n+ os\u221211 o s 2 ( k1\u03b81 o1 )s\u22121 k1\u03b81,2 o2 s\u22121\u2211 i=0 ( k2\u03b82 o2 )i o2f2(o2)\n+ [<]s ( os\u221211 o s 2 ( k1\u03b81 o1 )s\u22121) (20)\n= os\u221211 o s 2\n ( k1\u03b81 o1 )s \u2212 1\nk1\u03b81 o1 \u2212 1  o1f1(o1) + os\u221211 o s 2 ( k1\u03b81 o1 )s\u22121 k1\u03b81,2 o2 1\u2212 ( k2\u03b82 o2 )s 1\u2212 k2\u03b82o2\n o2f2(o2) + [<]s ( os\u221211 o s 2 ( k1\u03b81 o1 )s\u22121) .

Then, there exists an integer s such that PoA (LBs(k1, k2, o1, o2, f1, f2)) > M , and this shows the claim.\nFinally, suppose that Case 1 of Lemma 6 holds and let k, o, f be the parameters defined for that case. Consider the load balancing graph LBs(k, k, o, o, f, f). Observe that, analogously to the previous cases, \u03c3s is an -approximate pure Nash equilibrium. Indeed, it suffices considering the previous proofs with\nk1 = k2 = k. To evaluate SUM(\u03c3s), observe that all the equalities up to (17) hold. Therefore, by continuing from (17) we get\nSUM(\u03c3s) = o s\u22121 1 o s 22skf(k)\nif \u03b2U(PoA , k, o, f) = 0 (as in such case we get k1\u03b81 o1 = k2\u03b82o2 = 1), and\nSUM(\u03c3s) = o s\u22121 1 o s 2 1\u2212 ( kf(k) (1+ )of(k+1) )2s 1\u2212 kf(k)(1+ )of(k+1)  kf(k) if \u03b2U(PoA , k, o, f) > 0 (as in such case we get\nk1\u03b81 o1 = k2\u03b82o2 < 1). To evaluate SUM(\u03c3\u2217s ), observe that all the equalities up to (19) hold. Therefore, by continuing from (19), we get\nSUM(\u03c3\u2217s ) = o s\u22121 1 o s 2(2sof(o) + [\u2264]s(1))\nif \u03b2U(PoA , k, o, f) = 0, and\nSUM(\u03c3\u2217s ) = o s\u22121 1 o s 2  1\u2212 ( kf(k) (1+ )of(k+1) )2s 1\u2212 kf(k)(1+ )of(k+1)  of(o)\u2212 of(o) + [<]s(1) \nif \u03b2U(PoA , k, o, f) > 0.

Thus, there exists an integer s such that PoA (LBs(k1, k2, o1, o2, f1, f2)) > M , and this shows the claim if the first Case of Lemma 6 holds. ut\nThen, we prove a similar limitation for approximate one-round walks.\nTheorem 4 Let C be a class of latency functions that is closed under ordinate scaling. Then \u03b3U(CR s ,U(C)) = CRs (U(C)) = CRs (ULB(C)). If the functions of C are semi-convex, we have that \u03b3U(CRc ,U(C)) = CRc (U(C)) = CRc (ULB(C)).\nProof Fix M < \u03b3U(EM,U(C)), where EM \u2208 {CRs ,CRc } is the considered efficiency metric. As in Theorem 3, by Lemma 5, it is sufficient showing that there exists a load balancing game LB \u2208 ULB(C) such that its competitive ratio is at least M .\nLet us start with the case of selfish players. Let k1, k2, o1, o2, f1, f2, \u03b11, \u03b12 be the parameters defined as in Lemma 6, for which we remove index j \u2208 [2] if the first case of Lemma 6 is verified. Define j(i) = 1 if i \u2208 [s] and j(i) = 2 otherwise. We extend the load balancing graph LB(k1, k2, o1, o2, f1, f2) used in the proof of Theorem 3 according to the following recursive procedure.\n\u2022 Base Case: partition the resources of the first level (resp. second level) of the load balancing graph in oj(2) (resp. kj(1)) groups of equal size, and add edges from the first level to the second one in such a way that each resource in the first level has exactly kj(1) outgoing edges, each ending in a different group of the second level, and each resource in the second level has exactly oj(2) incoming edges, each coming from a different group of the first level; number the groups of the second level from 1 to kj(1) and label each resource with the number associated to the group it belongs to. For an illustrating example see Figure 7, where resources belonging to different groups at level 1 are represented with different colors, resources belonging to different groups at level 2 belong to different rectangles and they are labeled with the number of the rectangle they belong to. \u2022 Inductive Case: as inductive hypothesis, suppose that resources at level i \u2208 [2s\u2212 1] have been partitioned into m(i) groups of equal size and labeled with values from 1 to kj(i\u22121), where each label is assigned to m(i)/kj(i\u22121) distinct groups, and that all the edges from level i\u2212 1 to level i have been added. Partition resources at level i+ 1 in a temporary partition of m(i)\ngroups of equal size, and consider a bijective correspondence between groups at level i and groups at level i + 1 (in Figure 7, groups at levels 2 and 3 which are in bijective correspondence have been depicted in the same dashed square). Partition each group at level i into oj(i+1) subgroups of equal size, and the corresponding group at level i + 1 (according to the bijective correspondence considered above) into kj(i) subgroups of equal size, and add edges from each group at level i to the corresponding group at level i+ 1 in the same way as described in the base case, i.e., each resource in the group at level i has exactly kj(i) outgoing edges, each ending in a different subgroup of the corresponding group at level i + 1, and each resource in this group has exactly oj(i+1) incoming edges, each coming from a different subgroup of the considered group at level i. For each group at level i+ 1, number its subgroups with values from 1 to kj(i) and label each resource with the number associated to the subgroup which the considered resource belongs to. The final partitioning of nodes at level i+ 1 is made of all the m(i+ 1) := m(i)kj(i) subgroups considered above, these groups have equal size, they are labeled with values from 1 to kj(i), each label is assigned to m(i+ 1)/kj(i\u22121) = m(i) distinct groups, and all the edges from level i to level i+ 1 have been added. Thus the inductive step is well-defined and allows to construct the structure of the load balancing graphs, starting from the lowest levels, to the higher ones. For instance, Figure 7 depicts the recursive procedure used to construct a load balancing graph. In Figure 7, each arbitrary dashed square includes a group at level 2 and a group at level 3 which are in bijective correspondence. Analogously to the base case, resources belonging to different subgroups of the considered group at level 2 (resp. at level 3) are represented with different colors (resp. belong to different squares and are labeled with the number of the square they belong to).\nAgain, all the players can select their first and second strategies, only. Let i(v) be the level of resource v and h(v) \u2208 [kj(i(v))] be the label assigned to resource v by the previous recursive procedure.\nFor i, j \u2208 [2] and h \u2208 ki, define \u03b8i,j(h) := fi(h)(1+ )fj(kj+1) and \u03b8i(h) := \u03b8i,i(h). Resource v has latency function gv(x) := f1(x) if i(v) = 1, gv(x) := \u03b81(h(v))Au\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nAv\nf1(x) if i(v) \u2208 [s]2, gv(x) := \u03b81,2(h(v))Au\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 Av f2(x) if i(v) = s+ 1, and\ngv(x) := \u03b82(h(v))Au\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 Av f2(x) otherwise, where (u, v) is an arbitrary incoming edge of v and Av is recursively defined on the basis of Au by setting Av = 1 for i(v) = 1. By using the recursive structure of the load balancing graph, one can prove that Au = Au\u2032 if (u, v) and (u\n\u2032, v) are both edges of the load balancing graph, so that the definition of Av (and then gv) is independent of the particular incoming edge of v.\nConsider the online process \u03c4s in which: (i) players enter the game in non-increasing order of level (with respect to their first strategy) and, within the same level, players are processed in non-decreasing order of position defined\nby labelling function h; (ii) each player selects her first strategy. Similarly as in Lemma 4, one can show that \u03c4s is an -approximate one-round walk generated by selfish players. To show this, let z be an arbitrary player entering the game according to \u03c4s, and let u and v be her first and second strategy, respectively. One can show that, when z is entering the game, there are h(v) \u2212 1 players already assigned to u, and kj(i(v)) players assigned to v; thus, similarly as in Lemma 4, and by using the recursive definition of the latency functions, one can show that the individual cost of player z is exactly (1 + ) times the cost resulting from a deviation in favour of her second strategy.\nNow, let \u03c3 and \u03c3\u2217s be the strategy profile generated by the -approximate one-round walk \u03c4s and the optimal strategy profile, respectively. In the remainder of the proof, with the aim of estimating the competitive ratio of LBs,n(k1, k2, o1, o2, f1, f2), we compare the social value of the strategy profile \u03c3s with that of \u03c3 \u2217 s . Let SUMi(\u03c3s) denote the total latency of resources under strategy profile \u03c3. By using similar approaches as in Theorem 2 (since the metric is the competitive ratio) and Theorem 3 (since the game is unweighted), one can prove that\nSUMi(\u03c3s) = \u2211\nv in level i\nkv(\u03c3s)gv (kv(\u03c3s))\n= ( os\u2212i1 o s 2 ) \u2211 (h1,h2,...,hi\u22121)\u2208[k1]i\u22121 ( i\u22121\u220f t=1 \u03b81(ht) ) k1f1(k1) = ( os\u221211 o s 2 )(\u2211k1 h=1 \u03b81(h)\no1\n)i\u22121 k1f1(k1)\n= ( os\u221211 o s 2\n)( \u2211k1 h=1 f1(h)\no1f1(k1 + 1)\n)i\u22121 k1f1(k1)\nfor any i \u2208 [s], and\nSUMi(\u03c3s) = ( os\u221211 o s 2\n)(\u2211k1 h=1 \u03b81(h)\no1\n)s\u22121(\u2211k1 h=1 \u03b81,2(h)\no2 ) (\u2211k2\nh=1 \u03b82(h)\no2\n)i\u22121\u2212s k2f2(k2)\n= ( os\u221211 o s 2\n)( \u2211k1 h=1 f1(h)\no1f1(k1 + 1)\n)s\u22121(\u2211k1 h=1 f1(h)\no2f2(k2 + 2) ) (\u2211k2\nh=1 f2(h) o2f2(k2 + 2)\n)i\u22121\u2212s k2f2(k2)\nThus, we can compute SUM(\u03c3s) = \u22112s i=1 SUMi(\u03c3s) and, analogously, we can compute SUM(\u03c3\u2217s ). At this point, by using the same proof arguments of\nTheorems 2 and 3, we can prove that\nlim s\u2208N CRs (LBs,n(k1, k2, o1, o2, f1, f2)) \u2265 lim s\u2192\u221e\nSUM(\u03c3s)\nSUM(\u03c3s\u2217)\n\u2265 \u03b11k1f1(k1) + \u03b12k2f2(k2) \u03b11o1f1(o1) + \u03b12o2f2(o2)\n> M, (23)\nwhere the last inequality comes from Lemma 6, and this shows the claim in the case of selfish players.\nFor the case of cooperative players, it suffices considering the same load\nbalancing graph with \u03b8i,j(h) = hifi(hi)\u2212(hi\u22121)fi(hi\u22121) (1+ )((kj+1)fj(kj+1)\u2212kjfj(kj)) . Let \u03c3s and \u03c3 \u2217 s be the strategy profiles in which each player chooses her first and second strategy, respectively. By using the same arguments as in the previous proof, one can show that inequality (23) holds for the case of cooperative players, too. ut\nRemark 5 Fix a metric EM \u2208 {PoA ,CRs ,CRc }, a class of latency functions C, and let (k1, k2, o1, o2, f1, f2) (resp. (k, o, f)) be a tuple such that values \u03b11, \u03b12 considered in Case 2 of Lemma 6 are positive (resp. such that the inequality of Case 1 corresponding to the considered metric EM is satisfied, i.e., \u03b2U(EM, k, o, f) \u2265 0). As in Remark 3, by inspecting the proofs of Theorems 3 and 4, we can construct a load balancing instance parametrized by the above tuple whose performance is at least \u03b11k1f1(k1)+\u03b12k2f2(k2)\u03b11o1f1(o1)+\u03b12o2f2(o2) (resp. kf(k) of(o) ). Thus, in case we are not able to quantify the exact value of \u03b3U(EM,U(C)), we can still find a choice of the above parameters that leads to good (and possibly tight) lower bounds; the tightness can be shown by resorting to the characterization provided in Remark 4.\n4.3 Application to Polynomial Latency Functions\nLet \u03b3U(EM,U(P(d))) with EM \u2208 {PoA ,CRs ,CRc } be the quantity defined at the beginning of the section, where P(d) is the class of polynomial latency functions of maximum degree d. By Lemma 5, \u03b3U(EM,U(P(d))) constitutes an upper bound on the efficiency metrics EM \u2208 {PoA ,CRs ,CRc } for unweighted congestion games and load balancing games with polynomial latency functions of maximum degree d.\n\u03b3U(PoA ,U(P(d))) has been already evaluated in [3, 23]. \u03b3U(CRc ,U(P(d))) has been evaluated in [20] for exact pure Nash equilibria and affine functions;8\nby using similar arguments as in [3], one can easily compute the exact value of \u03b3U(CR c ,U(P(d))) for any > 0.\nThe above values of EM \u2208 {PoA ,CRc } can be also represented by resorting to the characterization provided by Remark 4. In particular, let k be the unique\n8 As in Subsection 3.3, the value of \u03b3U(EM,U(P(d))) can be easily derived from equivalent results appearing in the cited works, thus the analysis leading to such quantification has been omitted.\nreal solution of equation \u03b2U(EM, k, 1, f) = 0, where f is the monomial function defined as f(t) = td. If k is not integer we have that \u03b3U(EM,U(P(d))) is equal to \u03b11k1f1(k1)+\u03b12k2f2(k2) \u03b11o1f1(o1)+\u03b12o2f2(o2)\n, where (k1, k2, o1, o2) := (bkc+ 1, bkc, 1, 1), f1 := f2 := f , and \u03b11 and \u03b12 are defined as in Case 2 of Lemma 6 with respect to parameters k1, k2, o1, o2, f1, f2. Instead, if k is integer, we have that \u03b3U(EM,U(P(d))) is equal to kf(k)f(1) , i.e., Case 1 of Lemma 6 is satisfied by tuple (k, 1, f).\nSince the class of polynomial latency functions P(d) satisfies the hypothesis of Theorem 3 and 4, as a corollary we have that the values of \u03b3U(EM,U(P(d))) considered above are tight upper bounds on the performance of load balancing games, thus matching the performance of general congestion games; this generalizes/improves some results of [20, 32], in which the considered lower bounds hold for load balancing games under some restrictions (e.g., d = 1 for the competitive ratio, and = 0 for the price of anarchy).\nRegarding the -approximate one-round walks generated by selfish players, we have that the exact value of \u03b3U(CR s ,U(P(d))) has been provided in [8] for d \u2208 [3] and = 0, thus, by Theorem 4, such value is tight even for load balancing games; even for the case of affine latencies (i.e., d = 1), this fact also improves a result of [9], in which a tight lower bound has been provided for general congestion games only, and the case of singleton strategies was left open.\nFor more general polynomial latency functions with maximum degree d > 3 and for any \u2265 0, an upper bound on \u03b3U(CRs ,U(P(d))) can be trivially obtained by reusing the upper bound shown in Subsection 3.3, that holds for more general weighted games; for exact one-round walks, a better upper bound has been recently provided in [38]. By Remark 5, we can get good lower bounds on the performance of -approximate one-round walks, having a similar representation as in the cases of EM \u2208 {PoA ,CRc }. In particular, let k be the highest non-negative integer such that \u03b2U(CR s , k, 1, f) \u2265 0, where f is the monomial function defined as f(t) = td; if \u03b2U(CR s , k, 1, f) > 0 (resp. \u03b2U(CR s , k, 1, f) = 0), we can consider the lower bounding instances defined in Theorem 4, parametrized by (k + 1, k, 1, 1, f, f) (resp. (k, k, 1, 1, f, f)); by Remark 5, the performance of such load balancing instances is equal to \u03b11k1f1(k1)+\u03b12k2f2(k2) \u03b11o1f1(o1)+\u03b12o2f2(o2) (resp. kf(k)of(o) ), where \u03b11 and \u03b1 are defined as in Lemma 6. Such load balancing instances improve the lower bounds obtained in [13], where it is showed that the -approximate competitive ratio of general unweighted congestion games is at least equal to the (d+1)-th Geometric polynomial evaluated in (1 + ); furthermore, for d > 3, we conjecture that the performance of the obtained load balancing instances match the exact value of \u03b3U(CR s ,U(P(d))), and in such case, they would match the competitive ratio of general congestion games with polynomial latency functions of maximum degree d. See Table 8 for some numerical comparisons."

            "text": "5.1 The Approximate Price of Anarchy of Weighted Games\nIn this section, we characterize the approximate price of anarchy of weighted symmetric load balancing games with identical resources having semi-convex latency functions. Given \u2265 0, \u03bb \u2208 (0, 1), a latency function f , and x > 0, let\n[x] ,f := inf{t \u2265 0 : f(x) \u2264 (1 + )f(x/2 + t)}, \u03b3 ,f (x, \u03bb) := \u03bbxf(x) + (1\u2212 \u03bb)[x] ,ff([x] ,f )\n(\u03bbx+ (1\u2212 \u03bb)[x] ,f )f(\u03bbx+ (1\u2212 \u03bb)[x] ,f ) .\nIn Theorem 5 and 6, we provide respectively upper and lower bounds on the -approximate price of anarchy (which are tight, under mild assumptions), and we generalize the results obtained in [40, 30], holding for the restricted case of affine and monomial latency functions with = 0. The high-level idea of the proofs, which are given in the appendix, is showing that the price of anarchy of class WSLB({f}), where f is a semi-convex latency function, is given by instances verifying the following conditions: (i) the number m of resources and the total weight W of players tends to infinite, in such a way that the ratio W/m tends to \u03bbx + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)[x] ,f , for some x > 0 and \u03bb \u2208 (0, 1); (ii) there is an optimal strategy profile in which all the resource congestions are equal (i.e., equal to W/m); (iii) at the worst-case equilibrium there are two groups A and B of resources, such that |A|/m and |B|/m tend respectively to \u03bb and 1\u2212 \u03bb, as m tends to infinite; (iv) at the worst-case equilibrium, each resource of group A has congestion x > 0, and each resource of group B has congestion [x] ,f \u2264 x, that can be equivalently defined as the minimum possible congestion\nguaranteeing the equilibrium conditions (while keeping the congestions in A equal to x). According to the above properties, the equilibrium and the optimal cost increase (with respect to m) as \u03bbmxf(x) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)m[x] ,ff([x] ,f ) and (\u03bbx+ (1\u2212 \u03bb)[x] ,f )m, respectively. Thus, we get that the approximate price of anarchy is equal to the the highest value of\n\u03bbxf(x)+(1\u2212\u03bb)[x] ,ff([x] ,f ) (\u03bbx+(1\u2212\u03bb)[x] ,f )f(\u03bbx+(1\u2212\u03bb)[x] ,f ) ,\nover x > 0 and \u03bb \u2208 (0, 1).\nTheorem 5 Let f : R\u22650 \u2192 R\u22650 be a semi-convex latency function, and let \u2265 0. We have that\nPoA (WSLB({f})) \u2264 sup x>0 max \u03bb\u2208(0,1) \u03b3 ,f (x, \u03bb).

(25)\nBy exploiting (25), one can obtain tight bounds on the price of anarchy of weighted symmetric load balancing games with identical resources having polynomial latency functions. The same tight bounds have been given in [40, 30] for monomial latency functions. In the following corollary of Theorems 5 and 6 we show that the same bounds hold for more general polynomial latency functions.\nCorollary 1 Let P(d) be the class of polynomial latency functions of maximum degree d. Then, PoA0(WSLB(P(d))) = d d(2d+1\u22121)d+1 2d(d+1)d+1(2d\u22121)d \u2208 \u0398\n( 2d\nd\n) .\nIn Table 9, we show a comparison between the cases of general and identical resources with respect to the price of anarchy for games with polynomial latency functions. As in Corollary 1, the general upper bound provided in Theorem 5 is well-suited to derive (possibly non-tight) upper bounds on the -approximate price of anarchy of symmetric polynomial load balancing games with identical resources for any > 0.\n5.2 Lower Bounds for Exact One-Round Walks\nThe following construction gives a class of lower bounds for exact one-round walks generated by selfish/cooperative players in unweighted load balancing games with identical resources having latency function f . Fix n \u2208 N and a sequence of integers 1 = o1 \u2264 o2 \u2264 . . . \u2264 on. Let E = E0 \u2283 E1 \u2283 E2 \u2283 . . . \u2283 En \u2283 En+1 = \u2205 be a sequence of sets of resources such that (|Ei\u22121| \u2212 |Ei|)oi = |Ei| (observe that such a sequence exists). For any i \u2208 [n], we have |Ei| players of type i whose set of strategies is Ei\u22121. Suppose that players enter the game in non-decreasing order with respect to their type. One can easily prove that the strategy profile \u03c3 in which each player of type i selects a different resource e \u2208 Ei is a possible outcome for an exact one-round walk generated by selfish/cooperative players. Consider the strategy profile in which, for any resource e \u2208 Ei\u22121 \\ Ei, there are exactly oi players of type i selecting e. We get\nCRs0({f}) \u2265 SUM(\u03c3)\nSUM(\u03c3\u2217) = \u2211n i=1(|Ei| \u2212 |Ei+1|)if(i)\u2211n i=1(|Ei\u22121| \u2212 |Ei|)oif(oi) . (26)\nFor linear latency functions, by using n = 1013 and oi = \u230a 44411 100000 i+ 1 + \u230a\u221a i 7 \u230b\u230b in (26), we get a lower bound of at least 4.0009 which improves the currently known lower bound of 4 given in [20]. We conjecture that a tight class of lower bounding instances for linear and more general polynomial latency functions is given by the union of all the instances described above, over all values of n \u2208 N and all sequences (oi)i\u2208[n]."

Let CG \u2208 G, and let \u03c3 and \u03c3\u2217 be an -approximate pure Nash equilibrium and an optimal strategy profile, respectively. We have that the maximum value of the following linear program in the variables \u03b1e\u2019s is an upper bound on PoA (CG) (recall that wi is the weight of player i, ke and oe are the equilibrium and optimal congestion of resource e, respectively):\nLP1 : max SUM(\u03c3)\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37\u2211 e\u2208E \u03b1eke`e(ke)\ns.t. \u2211 e\u2208\u03c3i \u03b1e`e(ke) \u2264 (1 + ) \u2211 e\u2208\u03c3\u2217i \u03b1e`e(ke + wi), \u2200i \u2208 N (30)\nSUM(\u03c3\u2217)\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37\u2211 e\u2208E \u03b1eoe`e(oe) = 1 (31)\n\u03b1e \u2265 0, \u2200e \u2208 E.\nIndeed, by setting \u03b1e = 1 for any e \u2208 E, we have that: (i) the objective function is the social cost at the equilibrium; (ii) the constraints in (30) impose some relaxed -approximate pure Nash equilibrium conditions (ensuring that each agent, at the equilibrium, does not get any benefit when deviating in favour of strategy \u03c3\u2217i ); (iii) (31) is the normalized optimal social cost (normalization is possible since there is some oe > 0, that implies oe`e(oe) > 0).\nBy upper bounding all the wi\u2019s in (30) with oe (this is possible since wi \u2264 oe for any i \u2208 N and e \u2208 E such that e \u2208 \u03c3\u2217i ) and by summing all the resulting constraints once scaled by a factor wi, we obtain the following relaxation of LP1:\nLP2 : max \u2211 e\u2208E \u03b1eke`e(ke)\ns.t. \u2211 e\u2208E\n\u03b1e\u03b2W(PoA , ke, oe, `e) \u2265 0 (32)\u2211 e\u2208E \u03b1eoe`e(oe) = 1 (33)\n\u03b1e \u2265 0, \u2200e \u2208 E,\nwhere \u03b2W(PoA , ke, oe, `e) is defined as in (1). Indeed:\u2211 i\u2208N wi \u2211 e\u2208\u03c3i \u03b1e`e(ke) = \u2211 e\u2208E \u2211 i\u2208N :e\u2208\u03c3i \u03b1ewi`e(ke) = \u2211 e\u2208E \u03b1eke`e(ke)\nand \u2211 i\u2208N wi \u2211 e\u2208\u03c3i \u03b1e`e(ke + wi) \u2264 \u2211 i\u2208N wi \u2211 e\u2208\u03c3i \u03b1e`e(ke + oe)\n= \u2211 e\u2208E \u2211 i\u2208N :e\u2208\u03c3\u2217i \u03b1ewi`e(ke + oe)\n= \u2211 e\u2208E \u03b1eoe`e(ke + oe).\nThen, we get inequality \u2211 e\u2208E \u03b1eke`e(ke) \u2264 (1 + ) \u2211 e\u2208E \u03b1eoe`e(ke+oe), that is equivalent to constraint (32). Consider the dual program of LP2 in the dual variables x and \u03b3 (respectively associated to the dual constraints (32) and (33)):\nDLP : min \u03b3\ns.t. \u03b3 \u00b7 oe`e(oe) \u2265 ke`e(ke) + x \u00b7 \u03b2W(PoA , ke, oe, `e), \u2200e \u2208 E (34) x \u2265 0, \u03b3 \u2208 R.\nIn DLP, one can assume that x \u2265 1, otherwise, if x < 1 and oe = 0 for some e \u2208 E, the dual constraint in (34) related to e is not feasible. Now, one can assume that oe > 0, since the constraint (34) corresponding to resource e is always verified if oe = 0, thus we can remove such constraint. Let \u03b3\u2217 be the optimal value of DLP. By the Weak Duality Theorem, we get \u03b3\u2217 \u2265 PoA (G). By (34) and the optimality of \u03b3\u2217, we get\n\u03b3\u2217 = min x\u22651 max e\u2208E \u03b3W(PoA , x, ke, oe, `e) \u2264 inf x\u22651\nsup f\u2208C(G), k>0,o>0\n\u03b3W(EM, x, k, o, f) 9 = \u03b3W(PoA ,G),\n(35) thus showing the claim for EM = PoA .\nFor EM = CRs , one can use a similar proof as in the previous case. Let \u03c4 = (\u03c3 0,\u03c31, . . . ,\u03c3n)\nbe the -approximate one-round walk involving selfish players that returns a strategy profile \u03c3 = \u03c3n. We consider the linear program LP1, but with constraint\u2211\ne\u2208\u03c3i\n\u03b1e`e(ke(\u03c3 i)) \u2264 (1 + ) \u2211 e\u2208\u03c3\u2217i \u03b1e`e(ke(\u03c3 i\u22121) + wi) (36)\nin place of (30), as constraint (36) is necessarily satisfied by the greedy choice of each selfish player i \u2208 N (when \u03b1e = 1 for any e \u2208 E); thus, by exploiting the same arguments as in the previous case, the maximum value of LP1 is an upper bound on CRs (CG). We have that\u2211\ni\u2208N wi \u2211 e\u2208\u03c3i \u03b1e`e(ke(\u03c3 i)) = \u2211 e\u2208E \u2211 i:e\u2208\u03c3i wi\u03b1e`e(ke(\u03c3 i))\n= \u2211 e\u2208E \u2211 i:e\u2208\u03c3i wi\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37(\u222b ke t=0 \u03c7[ke(\u03c3i\u22121),ke(\u03c3i)](t)dt ) \u03b1e`e(ke(\u03c3 i)) = \u2211 e\u2208E \u03b1e \u222b ke t=0  \u2211 i:e\u2208\u03c3i `e(ke(\u03c3 i))\u03c7[ke(\u03c3i\u22121),ke(\u03c3i)](t)\ndt = \u2211 e\u2208E \u03b1e \u222b ke t=0 \u2211 i\u2208N `e(ke(\u03c3 i))\u03c7[ke(\u03c3i\u22121),ke(\u03c3i)](t)\n dt (37) \u2265 \u2211 e\u2208E \u03b1e \u222b ke t=0 \u2211 i\u2208N `e(t)\u03c7[ke(\u03c3i\u22121),ke(\u03c3i)](t)\ndt = \u2211 e\u2208E \u03b1e \u222b ke t=0 `e(t)dt, (38)\n9 By exploiting the continuity of function \u2212kf(k) with respect to k \u2265 0, we have that the supremum (appearing in the inequalities) can be equivalently taken over k > 0 instead of k \u2265 0, without decreasing its value.\nwhere \u03c7 denotes the indicator function (i.e., \u03c7A(t) = 1 if t \u2208 A, \u03c7A(t) = 0 otherwise), and (37) holds since \u03c7[ke(\u03c3i\u22121),ke(\u03c3i)](t) is null if e /\u2208 \u03c3i; furthermore, we have that\u2211\ni\u2208N wi \u2211 e\u2208\u03c3\u2217i \u03b1e`e(ke(\u03c3 i\u22121) + wi) \u2264 \u2211 i\u2208N wi \u2211 e\u2208\u03c3\u2217i \u03b1e`e(ke + oe) = \u2211 e\u2208E \u03b1eoe`e(ke + oe).\n(39)\nThus, by (36), (38), and (39), we get\u2211 e\u2208E \u03b1e \u222b ke t=0 `e(t)dt \u2264 \u2211 i\u2208N wi \u2211 e\u2208\u03c3i \u03b1e`e(ke(\u03c3 i))\n\u2264 \u2211 i\u2208N wi(1 + ) \u2211 e\u2208\u03c3\u2217i \u03b1e`e(ke(\u03c3 i\u22121) + wi)\n\u2264 \u2211 e\u2208E \u03b1e(1 + )oe`e(ke + oe).\nSuch inequality is equivalent to constraint (32), but with CRs in place of PoA ; thus, we can continue the analysis from a linear program analogue to LP2, and by proceeding as in the case of the approximate price of anarchy, we can show the claim for EM = CRs .\nFinally, we consider the case EM = CRc . Let \u03c4 = (\u03c3 0,\u03c31, . . . ,\u03c3n) be the -approximate one-round walk involving cooperative players that returns a strategy profile \u03c3 = \u03c3n. Let \u02c6\u0300e denote the function such that \u02c6\u0300e(x) = x`e(x) for any x \u2265 0. By hypothesis, \u02c6\u0300e is a convex function for any e \u2208 E. Again, we can consider the linear program LP1, but with constraint\u2211 e\u2208E \u03b1e(\u02c6\u0300e(ke(\u03c3 i))\u2212 \u02c6\u0300e(ke(\u03c3i\u22121))) \u2264 (1 + ) \u2211 e\u2208E \u03b1e(\u02c6\u0300e(ke(\u03c3 i\u22121 \u2212i , \u03c3 \u2217 i ))\u2212 \u02c6\u0300e(ke(\u03c3i\u22121))) (40)\nin place of (30), as (40) is necessarily satisfied by the greedy choice of each cooperative player i \u2208 N (when \u03b1e = 1 for any e \u2208 E); thus, the maximum value of LP1 is an upper bound on CRc (CG). We have that\u2211 e\u2208E \u03b1eke`e(ke)\n= \u2211 e\u2208E \u02c6\u0300 e(ke)\n= \u2211 e\u2208E \u03b1e \u2211 i\u2208N (\u02c6\u0300e(ke(\u03c3 i))\u2212 \u02c6\u0300e(ke(\u03c3i\u22121)))\n= \u2211 i\u2208N \u2211 e\u2208E \u03b1e(\u02c6\u0300e(ke(\u03c3 i))\u2212 \u02c6\u0300e(ke(\u03c3i\u22121)))\n\u2264 (1 + ) \u2211 e\u2208E \u03b1e(\u02c6\u0300e(ke(\u03c3 i\u22121 \u2212i , \u03c3 \u2217 i ))\u2212 \u02c6\u0300e(ke(\u03c3i\u22121))) (41)\n\u2264 \u2211 i\u2208N (1 + ) \u2211 e\u2208E \u03b1e(\u02c6\u0300e(ke(\u03c3 i\u22121) + wi \u00b7 \u03c7\u03c3\u2217i (e))\u2212 \u02c6\u0300 e(ke(\u03c3 i\u22121)))\n= \u2211 i\u2208N (1 + ) \u2211 e\u2208\u03c3\u2217i \u03b1e(\u02c6\u0300e(ke(\u03c3 i\u22121) + wi)\u2212 \u02c6\u0300e(ke(\u03c3i\u22121)))\n= \u2211 e\u2208E \u03b1e \u2211\ni\u2208N :e\u2208\u03c3\u2217i\n(1 + ) ( \u02c6\u0300 e(ke(\u03c3 i\u22121) + wi)\u2212 \u02c6\u0300e(ke(\u03c3i\u22121)) )\n\u2264 \u2211 e\u2208E \u03b1e \u2211\ni\u2208N :e\u2208\u03c3\u2217i\n(1 + ) ( \u02c6\u0300 e(ke(\u03c3) + wi)\u2212 \u02c6\u0300e(ke(\u03c3)) ) (42)\n\u2264 \u2211 e\u2208E \u03b1e \u2211\ni\u2208N :e\u2208\u03c3\u2217i\n(1 + ) \u02c6\u0300e ke(\u03c3) + \u2211\nh\u2208[i]:e\u2208\u03c3\u2217 h\nwh \u2212 \u02c6\u0300e ke(\u03c3) + \u2211\nh\u2208[i\u22121]:e\u2208\u03c3\u2217 h\nwh  (43)\n= \u2211 e\u2208E \u03b1e(1 + )\n\u02c6\u0300e ke(\u03c3) + \u2211\nh\u2208N :e\u2208\u03c3\u2217 h\nwh \u2212 \u02c6\u0300e (ke(\u03c3))  (44)\n= \u2211 e\u2208E \u03b1e(1 + ) ((ke + oe)`e(ke + oe)\u2212 ke`e(ke)) ,\nwhere (41) comes from (40), (42) and (43) holds because of the convexity of the functions \u02c6\u0300e\u2019s (as F (x+ y + z)\u2212 F (x+ y) \u2265 F (y + z)\u2212 F (y) holds for any convex function F , and for any x, y, z \u2208 R\u22650), and (44) holds since the second sum in (43) is telescoping. Thus, inequality\u2211\ne\u2208E \u03b1eke`e(ke) \u2264 \u2211 e\u2208E \u03b1e(1 + )((ke + oe)`e(ke + oe)\u2212 ke`e(ke))\nholds. Again, this inequality is equivalent to constraint (32), but with CRc in place of PoA ; thus, we can continue the analysis from a linear program analogue to LP2, and by proceeding as in the case of the approximate price of anarchy, we can show the claim for EM = CRc .\nB.2 Proof of Lemma 2.\nFix M < \u03b3W(EM,G), where EM \u2208 {PoA ,CRs ,CRc } is the considered efficiency metric. First of all, we assume that, for any latency function f \u2208 C(G) and for any o > 0, there exists k > 0 such that \u03b2W(EM, k \u2032, o, f) < 0 for any k\u2032 > k. Indeed, if this is not the case, there exist o > 0, a latency function f , and a sufficiently large k > 0, such that Case 1 of the claim is verified by tuple (k, o, f), where f can be chosen as any non-constant function.\nGiven EM \u2208 {CRs ,CRc }, define\nU\u2265 := {(k, o, f) : k > 0, o > 0, f \u2208 C(G), \u03b2W(EM, k, o, f) \u2265 0} , U< := {(k, o, f) : k > 0, o > 0, f \u2208 C(G), \u03b2W(EM, k, o, f) < 0} , \u03b3\u2265(x) := sup\n(k,o,f)\u2208U\u2265 \u03b3W(EM, x, k, o, f) \u2208 R\u22650 \u222a {\u221e}\n\u03b3<(x) := sup (k,o,f)\u2208U<\n\u03b3W(EM, x, k, o, f) \u2208 R \u222a {\u221e}.\nOne can easily observe that U\u22650 is non-empty, and because of our previous assumption, U< is non-empty, too. If EM = PoA , we consider the same definitions \u03b3\u2265(x) and \u03b3<(x), but we assume that the supremum is restricted to the set of non-constant functions only. By definition of \u03b3W(EM,G), we have that\nM < \u03b3W(EM,G) \u2264 inf x\u22651 max{\u03b3\u2265(x), \u03b3<(x)} = inf x>0 max{\u03b3\u2265(x), \u03b3<(x)}10 (45)\nfor any {CRs ,CRc }. Furthermore, we have that \u03b3W(EM,G) \u2264 infx>0 max{\u03b3\u2265(x), \u03b3<(x)} holds even for EM = PoA . Indeed, for any x > 0, one can easily show that quantity \u03b3W(PoA , x, k, o, f) is maximized by a non-constant latency function f . Thus, even if the supremum in \u03b3<(x) and \u03b3\u2265(x) is calculated over the non-constant latency functions, inequality (45) holds as well.\nWe observe that \u03b3W(EM, x, k, o, f) is non-decreasing (resp. non-increasing) in x \u2265 0 if (k, o, f) \u2208 U\u2265 (resp. (k, o, f) \u2208 U<). Thus, we have the following remark:\nRemark 6 \u03b3\u2265(x) and \u03b3<(x) are non-decreasing and non-increasing in x \u2265 0, respectively. ut\n10 For x < 1, one can easily show that \u03b3\u2265(x) =\u221e. Thus, even if the infimum appearing in the inequality is calculated over x > 0, its value does not decrease (with respect to the infimum over x \u2265 1).\nLet x\u2217 := max{0, sup{x > 0 : \u03b3\u2265(x) < \u03b3<(x)}} \u2208 R\u22650 \u222a {\u221e}. By exploiting (45), the definition of x\u2217, and Remark 6, we get\nM < \u03b3W(EM,G) \u2264 inf x>0\nmax{\u03b3\u2265(x), \u03b3<(x)} \u2264 min {\nlim x\u2192x\u2217\u2212 \u03b3<(x), lim x\u2192x\u2217+ \u03b3\u2265(x)\n} , (46)\nin which the left-hand (resp. right-hand) limit is not considered if x\u2217 = 0 (resp. x\u2217 =\u221e). In the following, we distinguish between the cases x\u2217 \u2208 (0,\u221e), x\u2217 = 0, and x\u2217 =\u221e.\nWe first assume that x\u2217 \u2208 (0,\u221e), and to show the claim in such a case, we will proceed as follows:\n\u2022 Step 1: We show that there exist two tuples (k1, o1, f1) \u2208 U< and (k2, o2, f2) \u2208 U\u2265 such that \u03b3 := \u03b3W(EM, x, k1, o1, f1) = \u03b3W(EM, x, k2, o2, f2) > M for some x > 0. \u2022 Step 2: We show that a dual program as DLP in (the proof of) Lemma 1, having two constraints only (except to those imposing the non-negativity of the variables), associated, respectively, to tuples (k1, o1, f1) and (k2, o2, f2), has an optimal value higher than M . \u2022 Step 3: By taking the dual of the above dual program, we obtain a primal program as LP2 in the proof of Lemma 1, but with two constraints and two variables only, and whose optimal value is higher than M (by the Strong Duality Theorem); the claim of Lemma 2 is obtained by characterizing the optimal solution of this primal program.\nStep 1: To prove Step 1, we start with the following lemma:\nLemma 7 We have that limx\u2192x\u0302\u2212 \u03b3\u2265(x) = \u03b3\u2265(x\u0302) = limx\u2192x\u0302+ \u03b3\u2265(x) for any x\u0302 > 0. 11\nProof Fix x\u0302 > 0. If limx\u2192x\u0302\u2212 \u03b3\u2265(x) = \u221e, we also get \u03b3\u2265(x\u0302) = limx\u2192x\u0302+ \u03b3\u2265(x) = \u221e (as \u03b3\u2265(x) is non-decreasing in x) and the claim follows. If limx\u2192x\u0302\u2212 \u03b3\u2265(x) <\u221e, we necessarily have that there exists c \u2265 0 such that \u03b2W(EM,k,o,f)\nof(o) \u2264 c for any (k, o, f) \u2208 U\u2265. Indeed, if it\nwere not the case, we would have that\n\u03b3\u2265(x) = sup (k,o,f)\u2208U\u2265\n( kf(k)\nof(o) + x\u03b2W(EM, k, o, f) of(o)\n) \u2265 x sup\n(k,o,f)\u2208U\u2265\n\u03b2W(EM, k, o, f)\nof(o) =\u221e,\nfor any x > 0, and then we would be in case limx\u2192x\u0302\u2212 \u03b3\u2265(x) =\u221e. Thus, for any sufficiently small \u03b4 > 0, we have that\n\u2265\u03b3\u2265(x\u0302\u2212\u03b4)\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37 \u03b3\u2265(x\u0302+ \u03b4)\n= sup (k,o,f)\u2208U\u2265\nkf(k) + (x\u0302\u2212 \u03b4)\u03b2W(EM, k, o, f)of(o) + \u22650\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37 2\u03b4\u03b2W(EM, k, o, f) of(o)  \u2264 sup\n(k,o,f)\u2208U\u2265\n( kf(k) + (x\u0302\u2212 \u03b4)\u03b2W(EM, k, o, f)\nof(o)\n) + 2\u03b4 sup\n(k,o,f)\u2208U\u2265\n\u03b2W(EM, k, o, f)\nof(o)\n= \u03b3\u2265(x\u0302\u2212 \u03b4) + 2\u03b4 sup (k,o,f)\u2208U\u2265\n\u03b2W(EM, k, o, f)\nof(o)\n\u2264 \u03b3\u2265(x\u0302\u2212 \u03b4) + 2\u03b4c,\nthat implies 0 \u2264 \u03b3\u2265(x\u0302+ \u03b4)\u2212 \u03b3\u2265(x\u0302\u2212 \u03b4) \u2264 2\u03b4c. (47)\nBy (47), and by the arbitrariness of \u03b4 > 0, we necessarily have that limx\u2192x\u0302\u2212 \u03b3\u2265(x) = \u03b3\u2265(x\u0302) = limx\u2192x\u0302+ \u03b3\u2265(x) (where the first equality holds since \u03b3\u2265 is non-decreasing), and this shows the claim. ut 11 Equivalently, Lemma 7 states that \u03b3\u2265(x\u0302), as function from R>0 to R\u22650 \u222a {\u221e}, is continuous in x\u0302 > 0.\nBy applying Lemma 7 to (46), we get that there exists a sufficiently small \u03b4 > 0 such that M < \u03b3W(EM,G) \u2264 \u03b3\u2265(x) for any x > 0 with |x \u2212 x\u2217| \u2264 \u03b4; furthermore, by exploiting the definition of x\u2217, we have that \u03b3<(x\u2217 \u2212 \u03b4) > \u03b3\u2265(x\u2217 \u2212 \u03b4) and \u03b3<(x\u2217 + \u03b4/2) \u2264 \u03b3\u2265(x\u2217 + \u03b4/2). These facts, easily translate in the existence of two tuples (k1, o1, f1) \u2208 U< and (k2, o2, f2) \u2208 U\u2265 such that \u03b3W(EM, x\n\u2217 \u2212 \u03b4, k1, o1, f1) > \u03b3W(EM, x\u2217 \u2212 \u03b4, k2, o2, f2) > M , \u03b3W(EM, x\u2217 + \u03b4, k1, o1, f1) < \u03b3W(EM, x \u2217 + \u03b4, k2, o2, f2), and \u03b3W(EM, x \u2217 + \u03b4, k2, o2, f2) > M . Thus, we get \u03b3 := \u03b3W(EM, x, k1, o1, f1) = \u03b3W(EM, x, k2, o2, f2) > M for some x \u2208 (x\u2217 \u2212 \u03b4, x\u2217 + \u03b4), and this concludes Step 1.\nStep 2: Consider a modification of the dual program DLP of Lemma 1, in which there are two resources e1 and e2 only, whose characteristics are expressed respectively by the tuples (k1, o1, f1) and (k2, o2, f2) determined in Step 1. Let DLP denote the new linear program in variables x, \u03b3, that is explicitly defined as follows:\nDLP : min \u03b3\ns.t. \u03b3o1f1(o1) \u2265 k1f1(k1) + x \u00b7 \u03b2W(EM, k1, o1, f1), \u03b3o2f2(o2) \u2265 k2f2(k2) + x \u00b7 \u03b2W(EM, k2, o2, f2), x \u2265 0, \u03b3 \u2208 R.\nBy exploiting the claim shown in Step 1, we get that (x, \u03b3) is the optimal solution of DLP, and since \u03b3 > M , we conclude Step 2.\nStep 3: The dual of DLP is a linear program LP similar to the program LP2 defined in the proof of Lemma 1, but with resources e1 and e2 only. In particular, LP is a linear program in variables \u03b11, \u03b12 explicitly defined as follows:\nLP : max \u03b11k1f1(k1) + \u03b12k2f2(k2)\ns.t. \u03b11\u03b2W(EM, k1, k1, f1) + \u03b12\u03b2W(EM, k2, o2, f2) \u2265 0 (48) \u03b11o1f1(o1) + \u03b12o2f2(o2) = 1 (49)\n\u03b11, \u03b12 \u2265 0\nBy the Strong Duality Theorem, the value of the optimal solution of DLP is equal to that of LP, that is higher than M . Furthermore, as the optimal solution (x, \u03b3) of DLP is such that x > 0, by the complementary slackness conditions, constraint (48) is necessarily tight. Thus, the following optimization problem in variables \u03b11, \u03b12 is equivalent to LP:\nOP : max \u03b11k1f1(k1) + \u03b12k2f2(k2)\n\u03b11o1f1(o1) + \u03b12o2f2(o2)\ns.t. \u03b11\u03b2W(EM, k1, f1, f1) + \u03b12\u03b2W(EM, k2, f2, f2) = 0,\n\u03b11, \u03b12 \u2265 0,\nand we observe that its optimal solution is obtained by setting\n\u03b11 := \u03b2W(EM, k2, o2, f2) > 0 \u03b12 := \u2212\u03b2W(EM, k1, o1, f1) \u2265 0.\nIf \u03b12 = 0, we are in Case 1 of the lemma, and if \u03b12 > 0 we are in Case 2. Thus, the claim follows if x\u2217 \u2208 (0,\u221e)\nNow, we consider the case x\u2217 = 0, and we resort to similar proof arguments as in the above case. By our initial assumptions, we have that, for any latency function f \u2208 C(G) and for any o > 0, there exists k > 0 such that \u03b2W(EM, k\n\u2032, o, f) < 0 for any k\u2032 > k. This shows that \u03b3<(0) =\u221e. By applying Lemma 7 to (46), we have that there exists a sufficiently small \u03b4 > 0 such that \u03b3\u2265(x) > M for any x \u2208 (0, \u03b4], and by exploiting the definition of x\u2217, we have that \u03b3\u2265(\u03b4/2) \u2265 \u03b3<(\u03b4/2). These facts translate into the existence of two tuples (k1, o1, f1) \u2208 U< and (k2, o2, f2) \u2208 U\u2265 such that \u03b3W(EM, 0, k1, o1, f1) > \u03b3W(EM, 0, k2, o2, f2) > M ,\n\u03b3W(EM, \u03b4, k1, o1, f1) < \u03b3W(EM, \u03b4, k2, o2, f2), and \u03b3W(EM, \u03b4, k2, o2, f2) > M . Thus, as in Step 1, we get \u03b3 := \u03b3W(EM, x, k1, o1, f1) = \u03b3W(EM, x, k2, o2, f2) > M for some x \u2208 (0, \u03b4), and by proceeding as in Steps 2 and 3 of the above case, we can show the claim when x\u2217 = 0.\nFinally, we consider the case x\u2217 = \u221e, i.e., when \u03b3\u2265(x) < \u03b3<(x) for any x > 0. We observe that there exists a sufficiently large x\u0302 > 0 such that \u03b3\u2265(x\u0302) > M . Thus, there are two tuples (k1, o1, f1) \u2208 U< and (k2, o2, f2) \u2208 U\u2265 such that \u03b3W(EM, x\u0302, k1, o1, f1) > \u03b3W(EM, x\u0302, k2, o2, f2) > M . Then, there exists x > x\u0302 such that \u03b3 := \u03b3W(EM, x, k1, o1, f1) = \u03b3W(EM, x, k2, o2, f2) > M , and by proceeding as in Steps 2 and 3 of the above cases, we can show the claim when x\u2217 =\u221e.\nB.3 Proof of Lemma 3.\nWe consider an arbitrary player z whose first strategy is a resource from a level i. Since the game is symmetric, we will show that: (i) if i \u2208 [2s\u2212 1] and the player deviates in favour of a resource from level j = i + 1, her cost decreases exactly of a factor 1 + ; (ii) if i \u2208 [2s] and the player deviates in favour of a resource from level j \u2264 i, her cost does not decrease; (iii) if i \u2208 [2s \u2212 2] and the player deviates in favour of a resource from level j > i+ 1, for any sufficiently large n, her cost does not decrease. In the following, we prove separately the three different cases. Let \u03c3js,n denote the strategy profile obtained when player z, from level i, deviates in favour of a different resource at level j.\n(i) Fix j := i+ 1. If i \u2208 [s\u2212 1], we get\ncostz(\u03c3s,n) = gi(n \u00b7 wi)\n= gi\n( n ( k1\nn\n)i)\n= \u03b8i\u221211 f1\n(( n\nk1\n)i\u22121 n ( k1\nn )i) = \u03b8i\u221211 f1(k1) = (1 + )\u03b8i1f1(k1 + 1)\n= (1 + )\u03b8i1f1\n(( n\nk1\n)i( n ( k1\nn\n)i+1 + ( k1\nn\n)i))\n= (1 + )gi+1\n( n ( k1\nn\n)i+1 + ( k1\nn )i) = gi+1(n \u00b7 wi+1 + wi)\n= (1 + )costz(\u03c3 i+1 s,n );\nif i = s, we get\ncostz(\u03c3s,n) = gs\n( n ( k1\nn )s) = \u03b8s\u221211 f1 (( n\nk1\n)s\u22121 n ( k1\nn )s) = \u03b8s\u221211 f1(k1) = (1 + )\u03b8s\u221211 \u03b81,2f2(k2 + 1)\n= (1 + )\u03b8s\u221211 \u03b81,2f2\n(( n\nk1\n)s ( n ( k1\nn )s (k2 n ) + ( k1 n )s)) = (1 + )gs+1 ( n ( k1\nn )s (k2 n ) + ( k1 n )s)\n= (1 + )costz(\u03c3 s+1 s,n );\nif i \u2208 [2s\u2212 1]s+1, we get\ncostz(\u03c3s,n)\n= gi\n( n ( k1\nn )s (k2 n )i\u2212s)\n= \u03b8s\u221211 \u03b81,2\u03b8 i\u2212s\u22121 2 f2\n(( n\nk1 )s ( n k2 )i\u2212s\u22121 n ( k1 n )s (k2 n )i\u2212s) = \u03b8s\u221211 \u03b81,2\u03b8 i\u2212s\u22121 2 f2(k2) = (1 + )\u03b8s\u221211 \u03b81,2\u03b8 i\u2212s 2 f2(k2 + 1) = (1 + )\u03b8s\u221211 \u03b81,2\u03b8 i\u2212s 2 f2((\nn\nk1 )s ( n k2 )i\u2212s( n ( k1 n )s (k2 n )i+1\u2212s + ( k1 n )s (k2 n )i\u2212s))\n= (1 + )gi+1\n( n ( k1\nn )s (k2 n )i+1\u2212s + ( k1 n )s (k2 n )i\u2212s) = (1 + )costz(\u03c3 i,i+1 s,n ).\n(ii) Fix j \u2264 i. If e is at level i and e\u2032 is at level j, we easily have that ge(ke) \u2264 ge\u2032(k\u2032e). Therefore costz(\u03c3s,n) \u2264 (1 + )costz(\u03c3js,n). (iii) Let n be a sufficiently large integer such that\nmax{f1(k1), f2(k2)}\n\u2264 (1 + )\u03b8s\u221211 \u03b81,2\u03b8 s\u22121 2 min { f1 ( k1 +\nn\nmax{k1, k2}\n) , f2 ( k2 +\nn\nmax{k1, k2}\n)} .\nObserve that n exists since f1 and f2 are non-decreasing and unbounded. Informally, this value of n is chosen in such a way that, when a player from level i deviates in favor of a resource from the last level, her cost does not decrease, and one can easily see that this fact guarantees that costz(\u03c3s,n) \u2264 (1 + )costz(\u03c3js,n) for any j > i+ 1 (and independently from index i).\nWe conclude that \u03c3s,n is an -approximate pure Nash equilibrium."

In particular, we can show the claim of Lemma 6 by resorting to the following steps: (i) we start from the upper bound \u03b3U(EM,G) obtained in Lemma 5; (ii) we derive a linear program DLP similar as the dual program used in Lemma 5, but with two constraints only (except for those imposing the non-negativity of the variables), and whose optimal value is higher than M ; (iii) the dual of DLP is similar to the linear program LP used in Lemma 5, but with two constraints and two variables only, and has the same optimal value (higher than M) as in DLP (by the Strong Duality Theorem); (iv) finally, the claim of Lemma 6 is obtained by characterizing the optimal solution of LP."

            "text": "D.1 Proof of Theorem 5.\nLet LB(W,m) \u2208WSLB({f}) be an arbitrary weighted load balancing game with identical resources such that W is the total weight of players (i.e., W = \u2211 i\u2208N wi), and the set of resources E is equal to [m] for some integer m \u2265 2. Let \u03c3 be an -approximate pure Nash equilibrium and \u03c3\u2217 be an optimal strategy profile. Let C1(W,m) := { x \u2208 Rm\u22650 : \u2211 e\u2208[m] xe = W } . Lemma 8 SUM(\u03c3\u2217) \u2265Wf ( W m ) .\nProof Let gm(x) := \u2211 e\u2208[m] xef(xe) for any x \u2208 Rm\u22650, and let\nopt(W,m) := min x\u2208C1(W,m) \u2211 e\u2208[m] gm(x).\nObserve that opt(W,m) \u2264 SUM(\u03c3\u2217). Since gm(x) is a convex function over C1(W,m), that is a compact and convex subset of Rm, we have that gm(x) admits at least one minimum point x := (x1, x2, . . . , xm). Let xj = (x j 1, x j 2, . . . , x j m) be such that x j e := xe+j for any e \u2208 [m], where the indices are cyclical with respect to m (i.e., j +m := j). Due to the symmetry of function gm(x), all the xj \u2019s are minima of gm. Due to the convexity of the function gm and the set C1(W,m), we have that the set C\u2217(W,m) of the minima of gm is a convex subset of\nC1(W,m), therefore x\u2217 := \u2211m\u22121 j=0 xj m \u2208 C\u2217(W,m) (since x\u2217 is convex combination of all the\nxj \u2019s). Since x\u2217e = \u2211m e=1 xe m = W m we have that Wf ( W m ) = g(x\u2217) = opt(W,m) \u2264 SUM(\u03c3\u2217), thus concluding the proof. ut\nBy the previous lemma we have that\nPoA (LB(W,m)) \u2264 max\u03c3\u2208NE (LB(W,m)) SUM(\u03c3)\nWf (W/m) . (53)\nLemma 9 Let \u03c3 be an -approximate pure Nash equilibrium, and let ke and ke\u2032 be respectively the maximum and the minimum congestion in \u03c3. If [ke] ,f > ke\u2032 , then (i) there is exactly one player j selecting resource e in \u03c3, and (ii) there exists an optimal strategy profile \u03c3\u2217 in which player j is the unique player playing resource e.\nProof We first show claim (i). Suppose, by way of contradiction, that there are at least two players using e in \u03c3. Therefore, there exists a player i among them with weight at most ke/2. By using the fact that \u03c3 is an equilibrium and by using the definition of [ke] ,f , we have that\ncosti(\u03c3) \u2264 (1 + )costi(\u03c3\u2212i, {e\u2032}) \u2264 (1 + )f(ke\u2032 + ke/2) < f(ke) = costi(\u03c3),\nwhere the last inequality comes from [ke] ,f > ke\u2032 . This fact leads to costi(\u03c3) < costi(\u03c3), that is a contradiction. Thus, there is exactly one player j selecting resource e in \u03c3.\nTo show claim (ii), consider an optimal strategy profile \u03c3\u2217 in which player j selects resource e (such an optimal strategy profile always exists) and assume that there is another player i selecting e. Suppose, without loss of generality, that e\u2032 is the resource having minimum congestion in the strategy profile \u03c3\u2217. We get\nSUM(\u03c3\u2217)\u2212 SUM(\u03c3\u2217\u2212i, {e\u2032}) =ke(\u03c3 \u2217)f(ke(\u03c3 \u2217)) + ke\u2032 (\u03c3 \u2217)f(ke\u2032 (\u03c3 \u2217))\u2212 (ke(\u03c3\u2217)\u2212 wi)f(ke(\u03c3\u2217)\u2212 wi)\n\u2212 (ke\u2032 (\u03c3\u2217) + wi)f(ke\u2032 (\u03c3\u2217) + wi) = ke(\u03c3\n\u2217)f(ke(\u03c3 \u2217))\u2212 (ke(\u03c3\u2217)\u2212 wi)f(ke(\u03c3\u2217)\u2212 wi)\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nA(ke(\u03c3\u2217))\n\u2212 ((ke\u2032 (\u03c3\u2217) + wi)f(ke\u2032 (\u03c3\u2217) + wi)\u2212 ke\u2032 (\u03c3\u2217)f(ke\u2032 (\u03c3\u2217)))\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 A(ke\u2032 (\u03c3 \u2217)+wi) . (54)\nSince wj is the maximum equilibrium congestion (because of the first claim of the lemma) and ke\u2032(\u03c3\n\u2217) is the minimum optimal congestion, we necessarily have that ke(\u03c3\u2217) \u2212 wi \u2265 wj = ke \u2265 W/m \u2265 ke\u2032(\u03c3\u2217) \u21d2 ke(\u03c3\u2217) \u2265 ke\u2032(\u03c3\u2217) + wi (observe that ke(\u03c3\u2217) \u2212 wi \u2265 wj holds since players i and j select resource e in \u03c3\u2217). Therefore, because of the semi-convexity of f , we have A(ke(\u03c3\u2217))\u2212 A(ke\u2032(\u03c3\u2217) + wi) \u2265 0 (in particular, such inequality holds since F (y + z) \u2212 F (x + z) \u2212 (F (y) \u2212 F (x)) \u2265 0 for any convex function F , and x, y, z \u2208 R\u22650 such that x \u2264 y). Then, because of (54), we get SUM(\u03c3\u2217\u2212i, {e\u2032}) \u2264 SUM(\u03c3\u2217), which proves the optimality of the strategy profile (\u03c3\u2217\u2212i, {e\u2032}). By applying iteratively the same proof arguments to the strategy profile (\u03c3\u2217\u2212i, {e\u2032}), at the end of the process we obtain an optimal strategy profile in which player j is the unique player selecting resource e in \u03c3\u2217, thus showing the claim. ut\nLet ke be the maximum equilibrium congestion of LB(W,m). By the previous lemma, we have that, if there exists a resource e\u2032 such that [ke] ,f > ke\u2032 , there is a resource used by a unique player j, in both the equilibrium and the optimal strategy profile, denoted respectively with \u03c3 and \u03c3\u2217. Therefore, if we remove player j and resource e from LB(W,m), \u03c3\u2212j and \u03c3\u2217\u2212j are respectively an equilibrium and an optimal strategy profile in the new game LB\u2032(W,m), verifying SUM(\u03c3)\u2212 kef(ke) = SUM(\u03c3\u2212j) and SUM(\u03c3\u2217)\u2212 kef(ke) = SUM(\u03c3\u2217\u2212j). Therefore PoA (LB(W,m)\u2032) \u2265 PoA (LB(W,m)).\nThus, for our aims, we can assume (without loss of generality) that all the approximate pure Nash equilibria of LB(W,m) verify [ke(\u03c3)] ,f \u2264 ke\u2032 (\u03c3) for each e, e\u2032 \u2208 E. We conclude that\nmax \u03c3\u2208NE (LB(W,m)) SUM(\u03c3) \u2264 max x\u2208C2(ke(\u03c3),W,m) \u2211 e\u2208[m] xef(xe), (55)\nwhere C2(x,W,m) := { x \u2208 Rm\u22650 : [x] ,f \u2264 xe \u2264 x \u2200e \u2208 [m], \u2211 e\u2208[m] xe = y } for any x > 0.\nLemma 10 Given x > 0 and x \u2208 C2(x,W,m), there exists \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1] such that (i)\u2211 e\u2208[m] xef(xe) \u2264 (\u03bbxf(x) + (1\u2212 \u03bb)[x] ,ff([x] ,f ))m, and (ii) W = (\u03bbx+ (1\u2212 \u03bb)[x] ,f )m.\nProof Let x > 0 and x \u2208 C2(x, y, l). For any e \u2208 [m], let \u03bbe \u2208 [0, 1] such that xe = \u03bbex+ (1\u2212 \u03bbe)[x] ,f , and let \u03bb := ( \u2211 e\u2208[m] \u03bbe)/m. By the semi-convexity of f we have that\nxef(xe) = (\u03bbex+(1\u2212\u03bb)[x] ,f )f(\u03bbex+(1\u2212\u03bb)[x] ,f ) \u2264 \u03bbexf(x)+(1\u2212\u03bbe)[x] ,ff([x] ,f ). (56)\nBy (56), we have that\u2211 e\u2208[m] xef(xe) \u2264 \u2211 e\u2208[m] (\u03bbexf(x)+(1\u2212\u03bbe)[x] ,ff([x] ,f )) = \u03bbmxf(x)+(1\u2212\u03bb)m[x] ,ff([x] ,f ),\nand this shows claim (i). To show claim (ii), we simply observe that\nW = \u2211 e\u2208[m] xe = \u2211 e\u2208[m] (\u03bbex+ (1\u2212 \u03bbe)[x] ,f ) = \u03bbmx+ (1\u2212 \u03bbe)m[x] ,f .\nut\nBy applying Lemma 10, and by using inequalities (53) and (55), we get\nPoA (LB(W,m)) \u2264 max\u03c3\u2208NE (LB(W,m)) SUM(\u03c3)\nWf (W/m)\n\u2264 sup x>0\nmaxx\u2208C2(ke(\u03c3),W,m) \u2211 e\u2208[m] xef(xe)\nWf (W/m)\n\u2264 sup x>0 sup \u03bb\u2208(0,1) (\u03bbxf(x) + (1\u2212 \u03bb)[x] ,ff([x] ,f ))m (\u03bbx+ (1\u2212 \u03bb)[x] ,f )mf(\u03bbx+ (1\u2212 \u03bb)[x] ,f )\n(57)\n= sup x>0 sup \u03bb\u2208[0,1] \u03b3 ,f (x, \u03bb)\n= sup x>0 max \u03bb\u2208(0,1) \u03b3 ,f (x, \u03bb), (58)\nwhere (57) comes from Lemma 10, and (58) holds since \u03b3 ,f (x, \u03bb), for any fixed x > 0, is maximized by some \u03bb \u2208 (0, 1)12, and this shows the claim.\n12 For any fixed x > 0, we have that \u03b3 ,f (x, \u03bb) \u2265 1 for any \u03bb \u2208 (0, 1) (as \u03bbxf(x) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)[x] ,ff([x] ,f ) \u2264 \u03bbx+ (1\u2212 \u03bb)[x] ,f , by semi-convexity of f), and \u03b3 ,f (x, \u03bb) approaches to 1 as \u03b3 tends to either 0 or 1. Thus, as \u03b3 ,f (x, \u03bb) is continuous, it admits a maximum point \u03bb \u2208 (0, 1).\nD.2 Proof of Theorem 6.\nIt suffices showing that, for each M < supx>0 sup\u03bb\u2208(0,1) \u03b3 ,f (x, \u03bb), there exists LB \u2208 WSLB({f}) such that PoA (LB) > M. For any x > 0 and \u03bb \u2208 (0, 1), let opt(x, \u03b3) denote \u03b3x+ (1\u2212 \u03bb)[x] ,f .\nFix x > 0. Let m be a sufficiently large even number such that h(m) := dm\u03bb\u2217(x)e \u2264 m/2 (this number exists as \u03b3\u2217(x) \u2264 1/2). We observe that opt(x, h(m)/m)\u2212x/2 \u2265 0. Indeed, if = 0, we have that [x] ,f = x/2, thus opt(x, h(m)/m)\u2212x/2 \u2265 (h(m)/m)x/2+(1\u2212h(m)/m)x/2\u2212 x/2 = 0; instead, if > 0, we have that opt(x, h(m)/m) \u2212 x/2 \u2265 opt(x, \u03bb\u2217(x)) \u2212 x/2 \u2265 0, where the last inequality follows from the hypothesis on \u03bb\u2217(x).\nLet LBm(x) be a game with m resources, 2h(m) \u201cred\u201d players of weight x/2, and several \u201cblue\u201d players, of total weight (m\u2212 h(m))[x] ,f , that can be partitioned in the following two different ways:\n\u2022 in m\u2212 h(m) groups such that each group has total weight equal to [x] ,f ; \u2022 in m groups such that any of the first 2h(m) ones is made of \u201cdark blue\u201d players and has\ntotal weight equal to opt(x, h(m)/m)\u2212 x/2 \u2265 opt(x, \u03bb\u2217(x))\u2212 x/2 \u2265 0, and any of the remaining m\u2212 2h(m) groups is made of \u201clight blue\u201d players and has total weight equal to opt(x, h(m)/m); we observe that the above quantities are well-defined as 2h(m) \u2264 m.\nWe can determine a set of blue players satisfying the previous conditions as follows. Consider a segment of (m \u2212 h(m))[x] ,f units of weight and the following two subdivisions of this segment:\n\u2022 Subdivision 1: m\u2212 h(m) intervals, each having [x] ,f units of weight; \u2022 Subdivision 2: 2h(m) intervals, each having opt(x, h(m)/m) \u2212 x/2 units of weight,\nfollowed by m\u2212 2h(m) intervals, each having opt(x, h(m)/m) units of weight. The desired set of blue players can be obtained by overlapping Subdivisions 1 and 2 and then associating a blue player of weight wi to each interval of wi units of weight of the resulting subdivision, call it Subdivision 3. Observe that, being Subdivision 3 a subdivision of Subdivision 2, we can properly associate dark blue players to the first 2h(m) intervals of Subdivision 3 and light blue players to the remaining ones. Observe also that Subdivision 3 is well defined (since (m\u2212 h(m))[x] ,f = 2h(m)(opt(x, h(m)/m)\u2212 x/2) + (m\u2212 2h(m))opt(x, h(m)/m), i.e., the total weights of Subdivisions 1 and 2 are equal).\nConsider the strategy profile \u03c3m defined as follows:\n\u2022 There are h(m) resources such that each resource is selected by two red players; thus the congestion of such resources is x. \u2022 There are m\u2212 h(m) resources with congestion [x] ,f played by blue players only; this configuration can be realized since the weights of the blue players are determined from an interval subdivision that is more refined than Subdivision 1.\nBy exploiting the definition of [x] ,f , we have that \u03c3m is an -approximate pure Nash equilibrium.\nNow, consider the strategy profile \u03c3\u2217m defined as follows:\n\u2022 There are 2h(m) resources of congestion opt(x, h(m)) such that each resource is selected by one red player and some dark blue players only; \u2022 There are m \u2212 2h(m) resources of congestion opt(x, h(m)) such that each resource is selected by light blue players only. By exploiting Subdivision 2, we observe that \u03c3\u2217m is well-defined. See Figure 10 for a clarifying example.\nBy using the definitions of \u03c3m and \u03c3\u2217m we have that\nPoA (LBm(x)) \u2265 SUM(\u03c3m) SUM(\u03c3\u2217m) = h(m)xf(x) + (m\u2212 h(m))[x] ,ff([x] ,f ) m \u00b7 opt(x, h(m)/m) = \u03b3 ,f (x, h(m)/m). As limm\u2192\u221e h(m)/m = \u03bb\u2217(x), and since \u03b3 ,f (x, t) is continuous with respect to t \u2208 (0, 1), we have that\nlim sup m\u2192\u221e PoA (LBm(x)) \u2265 lim m\u2192\u221e \u03b3 ,f (x, h(m)/m) = lim t\u2192\u03bb\u2217(x)\n\u03b3 ,f (x, t) = \u03b3 ,f (x, \u03bb \u2217(x)).\n(59) By taking the supremum of the right-hand part of (59) over x \u2265 0, we get the claim.\nD.3 Proof of Corollary 1. Let f be such that f(x) := \u2211p i=0 \u03b1i \u00b7 x i.

We equivalently have that gi(\u03bb) = \u03b3 ,f (x, \u03bb), where fi is\nthe monomial function defined fi(x) := x i. Let \u03bb\u2217i \u2208 (0, 1) be the value maximizing gi(\u03bb); we have that \u03bb\u2217i necessarily verifies \u2202 \u2202\u03bb gi(\u03bb)|\u03bb=\u03bb\u2217 = 0. Thus, by simple calculations, we get \u03bb\u2217i = 2i+1\u2212i\u22122 i2i+1\u2212i and\ngi(\u03bb \u2217 i ) =\nii(2i+1 \u2212 1)i+1\n2i(i+ 1)i+1(2i \u2212 1)i . (61)\nWe prove that gi(\u03bb \u2217 i ) is non-decreasing with respect to i \u2208 N, i.e., gi+1(\u03bb\u2217i+1)/gi(\u03bb\u2217i ) \u2265 1 for any i \u2208 N. If i = 1, the claim holds. If i \u2265 2, we get\ngi+1(\u03bb \u2217 i+1)\ngi(\u03bb\u2217i ) =\n(i+ 1)i+1(2i+2 \u2212 1)i+22i(i+ 1)i+1(2i \u2212 1)i 2i+1(i+ 2)i+2(2i+1 \u2212 1)i+1ii(2i+1 \u2212 1)i+1\n= (i+ 1)i+1(i+ 1)i+1\n(i+ 2)i+2ii \u00b7\n(2i+2 \u2212 1)i+2(2i+1 \u2212 2)i\n(2i+2 \u2212 2)i+1(2i+1 \u2212 1)i+1\n= (i+ 1)i+1(i+ 1)i+1\n(i+ 2)i+2ii \u00b7\n(2i+2 \u2212 1)(2i+2 \u2212 1)i+1(2i+1 \u2212 2)i\n(2i+2 \u2212 2)i+1(2i+1 \u2212 1)i+1\n\u2265 (i+ 1)i+1(i+ 1)i+1\n(i+ 2)i+2ii \u00b7\n2(2i+1 \u2212 2)(2i+2 \u2212 1)i+1(2i+1 \u2212 2)i\n(2i+2 \u2212 2)i+1(2i+1 \u2212 1)i+1\n= (i+ 1)i+1(i+ 1)i+1\n(i+ 2)i+2ii \u00b7 2\n=\n( (i+ 1)2\n(i+ 2)i\n)i \u00b7 2 ( i+ 1\ni+ 2 )2 \u2265 1,\nwhere the last inequality holds since (i+1)2\n(i+2)i \u2265 1 and ( i+1 i+2 )2 \u2265 1 2 for each i \u2265 2.\nTherefore, by continuing from (60), we get \u03b3 ,f (x, \u03bb) \u2264 maxi\u2208[d] gi(\u03bb\u2217i ) = gd(\u03bb\u2217d); thus, we can assume without loss of generality that f(x) = xd for any x \u2265 0.\nBy Theorem 5 and (61) we get\nPoA0(P(d)) \u2264 sup x>0 max \u03bb\u2208(0,1) \u03b3 ,f (x, \u03bb)\n= dd(2d+1 \u2212 1)d+1\n(d+ 1)2d(d+ 1)d(2d \u2212 1)d\n=\n( d\nd+ 1 )d ( (2d+1 \u2212 2 + 1)d+1 (d+ 1)(2d+1 \u2212 2)d )\n\u223c e\u22121 (\n2d+1 \u2212 2 + 1 d+ 1\n)( 2d+1 \u2212 2 + 1\n2d+1 \u2212 2 )d \u223c e\u22121 ( 2d+1 \u2212 2 + 1\nd+ 1\n) e d 2d+1\u22122\n\u223c 2d\nd ,\nthus showing the desired upper bound on the price of anarchy. Furthermore, we have that \u03bb\u2217d \u2264 1/2 for any d \u2208 N. Indeed, if d = 1 then \u03bb \u2217 1 = 1/3, otherwise, for d \u2265 2, we get\n\u03bb\u2217d = 2d+1 \u2212 d\u2212 2 d2d+1 \u2212 d \u2264 2d+1 \u2212 d\u2212 2 + d d2d+1 \u2212 d+ d \u2264 2d+1 d2d+1 \u2264 1/2.\nThus, since \u03bb\u2217d \u2264 1/2, we can apply Theorem 6 to show that the above upper bound is tight, and this concludes the proof."
