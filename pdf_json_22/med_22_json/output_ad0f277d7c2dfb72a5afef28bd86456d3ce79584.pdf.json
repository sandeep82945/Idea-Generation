    "abstractText": "Purpose To evaluate the clinical outcomes and prognosis of patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery for tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA) and identify risk factors for pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) recurrence. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis including 98 women who underwent laparoscopic surgery for TOA at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Bern University Hospital from January 2011 to May 2021. The primary outcome studied was the recurrence of PID after TOA surgery. Clinical, laboratory, imaging, and surgical outcomes were examined as possible risk factors for PID recurrence. Results Out of the 98 patients included in the study, 21 (21.4%) presented at least one PID recurrence after surgery. In the univariate regression analysis, the presence of endometriosis, ovarian endometrioma, and the isolation of E. coli in the microbiology cultures correlated with PID recurrence. However, only endometriosis was identified as an independent risk factor in the multivariate analysis (OR (95% CI): 9.62 (1.931, 47.924), p < 0.01). With regard to the time of recurrence after surgery, two distinct recurrence clusters were observed. All patients with early recurrence (\u2264 45 days after TOA surgery) were cured after 1 or 2 additional interventions, whereas 40% of the patients with late recurrence (> 45 days after TOA surgery) required 3 or more additional interventions until cured. Conclusion Endometriosis is a significant risk factor for PID recurrence after TOA surgery. Optimized therapeutic strategies such as closer postsurgical follow-up as well as longer antibiotic and hormonal therapy should be assessed in further studies in this specific patient population.",

            "text": "Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection affecting the uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes. This major global health problem leads to severe long-term complications such as chronic pelvic pain, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy [1, 2, 3]. It is estimated that 4% of women will have PID at some point in their lifetime and 1 in 8 women with a history of PID will experience difficulty getting pregnant [1]. In approximately one-third of the patients with PID, tubo-ovarian abscesses (TOA) occur, which are associated with higher morbidity and mortality [4, 5, 6]. Unfortunately, antibiotic therapy alone is not effective in many patients with TOA, and a surgical therapy is required [7, 8, 9].\nThe primary PID prevention strategies are well established [10]. Moreover, standardized therapeutic protocols for the management of PID exist, such as the Centers for Disease Controls and Prevention (CDC) guidelines [11, 12].\nMaria Zografou Themeli and Konstantinos Nirgianakis have equal contributions.\n* Maria Zografou Themeli maria.zografou@yahoo.com\n1 Department of\u00a0Gynecology and\u00a0Gynecological Oncology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of\u00a0Bern, Friedbuehlstrasse 19, 3010\u00a0Bern, Switzerland\n1 3\nHowever, previous work has failed to address the problem of PID recurrence, which appears in 15\u201320% of the patients and is associated with an almost two-fold increase in infertility [5]. A first step for the establishment of prevention strategies to avoid recurrence is the identification of risk factors leading to PID recurrence.\nThe aim of this study, therefore, was to evaluate the clinical outcomes and prognosis of patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery for TOA and identify possible risk factors for PID recurrence."

The primary outcome studied was the recurrence of PID after TOA surgery. Recurrence was defined as the occurrence of typical clinical signs such as fever or pelvic pain with increasing inflammatory markers or suspicion of recurrent tubo-ovarian complex in the imaging after TOA surgery (computer tomography (CT) scan or ultrasound (US)).\nAll patients with PID or TOA who received only a conservative antibiotic treatment without surgery were excluded. The clinical and imaging diagnostic standards for the diagnosis of TOA were in accordance with the BASHH Guidelines and the CDC Guidelines 2021 [12, 13]. TOA was confirmed intraoperatively by the presence of inflammatory exudate in the pelvis or the presence of pyosalpinx. The pre- and postsurgical course was documented in detail and Patients were divided into 2 groups (Group 1 = PID recurrence, Group 2 = non-recurrence)."

High cutoff levels of CRP (\u2265 60\u00a0mg/L) were used to identify patients with severe pelvic inflammatory disease or TOA [16].\nData on medical and surgical treatment outcomes (antibiotic regimen and its duration, type of operation, intraoperative findings, need for a second operation or an imaging-guided drainage postoperatively) as well as other clinical outcomes such as the length of hospitalization at first TOA episode and the presence of complications were extracted. We also extracted laboratory findings, such as the microbiology results of the vaginal, cervical, IUD, and pelvic swabs, blood culture results, postoperative CRP and WBC levels, and the histology findings."

The total number of patients differs in some cells due to missing (unknown) outcomes for some patients. Preoperative characteristics at the time of TOA diagnosis, such as age, parity, type of contraception, WBC count, CRP, clinical symptoms, and TOA size did not differ between the two groups. The most common symptoms were pelvic pain and fever, with most patients presenting a leukocytosis and a CRP \u2265 60\u00a0mg/l.\nNo differences between the two groups in the duration of surgery, intraoperative blood loss, and the quantity of saline solution used for lavage of the abdominal cavity were identified. However, the presence of endometriosis intraoperatively was more frequent in the recurrence group (13/21, 61.9% vs 12/77, 15.6%, p value < 0.001). In the most cases the presence of endometriosis was histologically confirmed, except from the cases with DIE (deep infiltrating endometriosis). In the last cases the diagnosis of endometriosis and the classification according to rASRM (revised American Society for Reproductive Medicine Score) or ENZIAN score has been made mainly during previous surgeries [17]. The incidence of an ovarian endometrioma was also higher in the recurrence group (Table\u00a01). Nine patients from the recurrence group presented an endometrioma during TOA surgery. This involved 5 times the left ovary, one time the right ovary and 3 times both ovaries. In all cases with ovarian endometrioma, the TOA was developed on the side of the endometrioma. Furthermore, out of 98 patients, 57 patients (58%) in both groups presented a pyosalpinx intraoperatively. Most patients had a fertility sparing surgery (76%) at first episode due to the young age, as well their wishes for fertility preservation and hormonal preservation.\nThe mean CRP value on the second day after surgery remained high (\u2265 60\u00a0mg/l in both groups), while the mean WBC count showed a slight decrease (< 11,000/mm3). Although these blood values were generally higher in the recurrence group, the difference did not reach statistical significance. Moreover, the differences between pre- and postsurgical WBC count and CRP were not statistically significantly different between groups. These results did not change even when only patients with early recurrence were analyzed.\nE. coli isolated in the vaginal, pelvic swab, blood culture, or urine culture was the only bacterium that was significantly associated with recurrence (8/19, 42.1% in the recurrence group vs 15/75, 20% in the non-recurrence group, p value = 0.045). The mean length of hospital stay after the first TOA surgery was 9.6 \u00b1 10.2\u00a0days in the recurrence group and 5.09 \u00b1 2.07\u00a0days in the non-recurrence group (p value = 0.0005).\nEndometriosis, ovarian endometrioma, and E.\u00a0coli were further evaluated as possible independent risk factors for PID recurrence using a multivariate logistic regression analysis. Four patients were not included in the analysis due to missed values. The analysis confirmed a significant association of endometriosis with disease recurrence [OR (95% CI): 9.62 (1.931, 47.924), p < 0.01] (Table\u00a02)."

For one patient the time of recurrence was unknown and therefore excluded from the further analysis.\nHalf of the patients (5/10) with early recurrence after TOA surgery were first treated only with antibiotics or with antibiotics and an imaging-guided drainage. The other 5 patients with early recurrence and all patients with late recurrence were treated with antibiotics and a laparoscopic or laparotomic procedure (Table\u00a03, Fig.\u00a03). In total, 7 patients (5 patients from early recurrence group, and 2 patients from the late recurrence group) ultimately required a laparotomic intervention to be cured.\nAll patients with early recurrence were cured after 1 or 2 interventions (antibiotics only, antibiotics and imagingguided drainage, antibiotics and laparoscopic or open surgery), whereas 40% of the patients with late recurrence required 3 or more of these interventions until cured (Fig.\u00a04)."

Furthermore, Tai et\u00a0al. in a large cohort study demonstrated that patients with a PID had a three-fold increase in the risk of developing endometriosis compared with women without PID [19]. Women with endometriosis also seem to be at higher risk for developing a severe pelvic inflammatory disease, which involves antibiotic\ntreatment failure and need for surgical intervention [20] while advanced stage of endometriosis (stage III and IV) is significantly associated with the occurrence of TOA [21]. It is also known that the incidence of TOA is higher in patients with ovarian endometrioma. Gao et\u00a0al. reported that lower genital tract infection and rupture of ovarian endometriosis cysts are significantly associated with the\nTable 3 Characteristics of patients in groups early and late recurrence\nBold values indicate statistically significant\nEarly recurrence (\u2264 45\u00a0days), N = 10 Late recurrence (> 45\u00a0days), N = 10 p value\nType of intervention at first recurrence Antibiotics only 4/10 (40%) 0/10 0.03 Antibiotics\nand surgery (laparoscopy or open)\n5/10(50%) 10/10\nAntibiotics and imagingguided drainage 1/10 (10%) 0/10\nTotal number of interventions (antibiotics, surgery, imaging-guided drainage) after 1. recurrence until cure 1 3/10 (30%) 5/10 (50%) ns 2 7/10 (70%) 1/10 (10%) 3 0 2/10 (20%) 4 0 1/10 (10%) 6 0 1/10 (10%)\n1 3\ndevelopment of TOA in women with ovarian endometriosis [22]. Furthermore, there are several case series, which have reported that IVF or oocyte retrieval are associated with the development of a TOA in patients with ovarian endometriosis [23, 24, 25].\nOur study is the first to determine that endometriosis is not only a risk factor for PID but also a significant risk factor for PID recurrence after TOA surgery.\nRegarding the pathogenic mechanisms leading to PID or TOA in patients with endometriosis, these include the static peritoneal milieu and cystic formation favorable to bacteria proliferation, the distorted anatomy of the ovaries and the tubes, an impairment in immune response [26], an increased inflammatory cytokines production [26, 27, 28] and alterations of the microbioma [27].\nOther risk factors for PID or TOA are well recognized and described in previous studies. These include young age (< 25\u00a0years), multiple sexual partners, frequent change of\nsexual partner, previous history of PID, no history of contraceptive use, previous history of intrauterine device (IUD) insertion, drug consumption, and cigarette smoking [4, 5, 29, 30].\nPID is usually polymicrobial with a mixture of aerobic, anaerobic, and facultative bacteria. The most frequent pathogens isolated from TOAs are E. coli (37%) and Bacteriodes Fragilis (22%) [4, 7, 31, 32]. Saini et\u00a0al. showed in 2003 that the predominant aerobic bacteria isolated from Douglas specimens from women with PID was E. coli (33.2%) [33]. Furthermore, E. coli is one of the most common causative pathogens for severe infections and also the second most common cause of sepsis [34]. These results are in agreement with the results of our study in which E. coli was the predominant pathogen bacterium isolated in 42.1% of the patients in the recurrence group and in 4/6 blood cultures of patients with septic shock.\nFig. 4 Total number of interventions at PID recurrence. This figure shows the total number of interventions (surgery, antibiotics, CT-guided drainage) after first PID recurrence in both groups (patients with early vs late recurrence) until cure. Blue refers to the group of patients with early recurrence or persistence (\u2264 45\u00a0days), orange to the group of patients with late recurrence (after 45\u00a0days)\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8 Total number of interventions after first PID recurrence\nEarly recurrence (\u226445 days) Late recurrence (>45 days)\n1 3\nReferring to the management of TOA, the traditional treatment is the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics with a success rate of about 70% [35, 36, 37]. However, the recurrence rate after antibiotics alone is high. It has been shown, that the failure of antibiotic treatment and the need of surgical intervention is correlated with the size of the abscess [37]. More specifically, abscess size \u2265 5\u20136.5\u00a0cm is an independent risk factor for failure of antibiotic treatment and an independent predictor of patients requiring a surgical treatment [38, 39, 40, 41]. Nowadays, laparoscopic treatment, imaging-guided drainage (transvaginal ultrasound (US) or computerized tomography (CT)-guided) are established minimally invasive treatments in the management of TOA [42]. Comparing the three minimal invasive techniques, early laparoscopy has the key advantage that allows sampling of tissue for histopathology diagnosis, allows assessment of the intraoperative situs, and is associated with less complications and better clinical prognosis in the appropriate populations\u2019 groups [39, 40, 43]. In our study, the mean size of abscess according to US or CT was 5.9\u00a0cm in both groups of patients. For these reasons, our first line therapy approach was the laparoscopy and not the imaging-guided drainage.\nInterestingly, all patients with late recurrence (> 45\u00a0days) underwent a laparoscopic or open surgery. However, 50% of them needed 2 or more interventions until cure. On the contrary, patients with early recurrence were cured with 1 or 2 interventions. Obviously, the chronic tubo-ovarian abscesses with recurrent episodes and extensive adhesions are more challenging to manage, resulting in more interventions until cure [44].\nIn our study population, the PID recurrence rate after surgical therapy for PID was 21.4%, a little higher than the reported recurrence rate of PID in the literature [5]. This reflects the fact that our department is a tertiary referral center to which the more complex cases are referred. As a result, 6 of the 98 patients with PID recurrence were referred to us after first surgery in another hospital; this results in the overstatement of the recurrence rate. Excluding these patients and considering only the patients treated in our hospital, the recurrence rate was 15.2%. On the other hand, we might have missed patients with PID recurrence who were treated in other hospitals after TOA surgery in our department. However, since our department is the tertiary center in the broader area, we estimate this likelihood to be very small.\nSome other potential limitations need to be considered. First, it is a single-center study, and consequently there were small numbers of events for some of the investigated outcomes; this resulted in a lower statistical power for these outcomes. Second, the design of this study was retrospective, with all the associated inherent limitations. On the other\nhand, the structured surgical approach to TOA and the relatively high data availability constitutes its strengths.\nIn conclusion, the laparoscopic management of TOA results in PID recurrence in more than 15% of the patients. This might be early or late recurrence, with the latter being more challenging, often requiring many interventions until cure. Endometriosis is a risk factor for recurrence and should therefore been taken into consideration when identified during TOA surgery. Optimized therapeutic strategies such as closer postsurgical follow-up as well as longer antibiotic and hormonal therapy should be assessed in further studies in this specific patient population.\nAcknowledgements We would like to thank all participants in our study.\nAuthor contributions ZTM: protocol and project development, data collection and management, data analysis, manuscript writing and editing.
