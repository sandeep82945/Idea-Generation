 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after reading the paper on the knowledgeable relation extraction system K-RET:

1. Apply K-RET to other biomedical relation extraction datasets to further test the flexibility and generalizability of the system across different entity types and relation labels. 

2. Explore different strategies for integrating knowledge in K-RET, such as using knowledge graph embeddings instead of simply adding ontology terms. This could potentially lead to more meaningful knowledge integration.

3. Develop methods to make K-RET's knowledge injection more dynamic and adaptive to each specific input sentence, rather than using a fixed approach. This could improve the contextual relevance of the injected knowledge.

4. Extend K-RET to a multi-task learning framework that jointly learns to extract relations and entities, allowing end-to-end integration of knowledge.

5. Evaluate K-RET in real-world biomedical applications, such as drug discovery or clinical decision support, to determine the practical utility of knowledge injection for improving performance on end tasks.
