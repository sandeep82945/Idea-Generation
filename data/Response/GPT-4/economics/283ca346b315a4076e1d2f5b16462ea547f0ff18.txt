Expansion to Other Geopolitical Risks and Conflicts: Investigate the impact of other geopolitical conflicts and risks on global financial markets using a similar methodological framework. This could include conflicts in the Middle East, tensions in the South China Sea, or emerging geopolitical risks in Africa and Latin America. Comparing different geopolitical events could provide insights into the universality or specificity of financial market reactions to geopolitical risks.

Sector-specific Analysis: Focus on how specific sectors (e.g., technology, healthcare, defense) are impacted by geopolitical risks over short, medium, and long-term horizons. This would offer more granular insights into market dynamics and help investors and portfolio managers in sector-specific risk management and investment strategy development.

Integration with Macroeconomic Variables: Combine the analysis of geopolitical risk impacts with macroeconomic indicators like GDP growth rates, inflation, and currency exchange rates. This broader approach would provide a more comprehensive view of how geopolitical tensions interact with economic fundamentals to influence financial markets.

Application of Machine Learning and AI: Utilize advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to predict financial market responses to geopolitical risks. These technologies could enhance the predictive power of models by identifying complex patterns and non-linear relationships that traditional econometric methods might overlook.

Policy and Regulatory Impact Study: Research the effectiveness of policy measures and regulatory interventions in mitigating the impacts of geopolitical risks on financial markets. This could involve analyzing the role of central banks, international financial institutions, and government policies in stabilizing markets during geopolitical crises. Additionally, this research could explore the development of new financial instruments or strategies for hedging against geopolitical risk.
