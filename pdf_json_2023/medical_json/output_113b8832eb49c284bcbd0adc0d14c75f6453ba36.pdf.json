E-mail: marilena.wilding@uni-graz.at\nSubjective perceptual experience is influenced not only by bottom-up sensory information and experience-based top-down processes, but also by an individual\u2019s current brain state. Specifically, a previous study found increased prestimulus insula and intraparietal sulcus (IPS) activity before participants perceived an illusory Gestalt (global) compared with the non-illusory (local) interpretation of a bistable stimulus. That study provided only a snapshot of the brain state that favors the illusory interpretation. In the current study, we tested whether areas that differentiate between the illusory and non-illusory perception, immediately before stimulus onset, are also associated with an individual\u2019s general tendency to perceive it, which remains stable over time. We examined individual differences in task-free functional connectivity of insula and IPS and related them to differences in the individuals\u2019 duration of the two stimulus interpretations. We found stronger connectivity of the IPS with areas of the default mode and visual networks to be associated with shorter local perceptual phases, i.e. a faster switch to an illusory percept, and an opposite effect for insula connectivity with the early visual cortex. Our findings suggest an important role of IPS and insula interactions with nodes of key intrinsic networks in forming a perceptual tendency toward illusory Gestalt perception.\nKey words: bistable illusion; fMRI; functional connectivity; resting-state networks; subjective perception."

            "text": "Our whole awake life, the brain is engaged in interpreting the overwhelming amount of visual input. We constantly select, sort, and group the incoming information to create a meaningful experience of the external world. These processes are usually automatic and are only called into question when an ambiguous or noisy cue has been interpreted in an illusory way rather than by its mere physical properties, e.g. when we misinterpret an object shadow as a threatening creature in the darkness or see contours of animals in cloud formations. These examples illustrate that the subjective interpretation of a stimulus is determined not only by the bottom-up sensory information that comes into the visual system, but also by our knowledge, goals, and expectations that shape the outcome of perception in a top-down fashion.\nThe neural mechanisms of these subjective, interpretative aspects of perception are often investigated using bistable (sometimes also called \u201cambiguous\u201d) stimuli. These visual stimuli can be interpreted in two different ways based on the same sensory input. During continuous viewing, subjective perception alternates spontaneously between these mutually exclusive interpretations, a state known as perceptual bistability (Sterzer et al. 2009; Mart\u00ednez and Parra 2018; Devia et al. 2022). A special type of bistable stimuli, termed \u2018asymmetric\u2019 bistable stimuli, is particularly relevant for studying the interpretative processes in perception. In contrast to typical bistable stimuli, which contain two equally complex perceptual interpretations, these stimuli yield one simpler interpretation that is closer to the actual sensory\ninput, and one more complex, illusory interpretation that is derived from the simpler one (Lorenceau and Shiffrar 1992; Anstis and Kim 2011).\nPrevious research with bistable stimuli showed that subjective perceptual experience is influenced not only by the sensory input and top-down influences, but also by an individual\u2019s current brain state (Kleinschmidt et al. 2012). For example, spontaneous brain activity in areas specialized for representing a certain sensory content increases before an ambiguous stimulus is perceived according to the area\u2019s \u2018preferred\u2019 interpretation. Specifically, spontaneous activity in the human face-selective fusiform face area is higher if participants subsequently report perceiving a face in the ambiguous face-vase illusion (Hesselmann et al. 2008a). In a recent fMRI study, we could demonstrate a similar effect using an asymmetric bistable stimulus with a global (illusory) and a local (non-illusory) interpretation (Anstis illusion, Anstis and Kim 2011; Wilding et al. 2022). We found increased prestimulus insula and intraparietal sulcus (IPS) activity before participants perceived the global compared with the local interpretation. These two key regions are repeatedly implicated in bistable perception (Brascamp et al. 2018), with the IPS selectively representing the illusory aspect of the stimulus (Zaretskaya et al. 2013; Grassi et al. 2018). As our previous study used a paradigm with task-free prolonged fixation periods interleaved with brief stimulus presentations, the findings suggest that an upcoming percept may be determined (or at least biased) by signal fluctuations in intrinsic resting-state brain networks. Specifically,\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /cercor/article/33/11/7175/7043311 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 13 January 2024\nprestimulus insula activity seems to indicate the involvement of the salience network and the IPS activity seems to indicate the involvement of the frontoparietal network in favoring the illusory global percept.\nImportantly, the study discussed above provided a snapshot of the prestimulus brain state that leads to favoring the illusory interpretation of the visual input. However, the perception of a bistable stimulus fluctuates not only moment-to-moment within an individual, there are also considerable inter-individual differences in the parameters of bistable perception across individuals, which remain relatively stable over time in conventional as well as asymmetric bistable paradigms (Kleinschmidt et al. 2012; Boeykens et al. 2019). Previous studies successfully linked interindividual variability in the reversal rate of conventional bistable stimuli to various aspects of brain structure and function, such as cortical thickness (Kanai et al. 2010, 2011), microstructural gray matter tissue properties (Kanai et al. 2010), and resting-state connectivity (Baker et al. 2015; Mao et al. 2020). These findings suggest that an individual\u2019s dynamic of bistable perception represents a trait-like property with corresponding signatures on the neural level.\nIn the current study, we tested whether the areas showing higher activity immediately before the illusory global percept occurrence are also associated with a subject\u2019s individual tendency to perceive the illusory component of the sensory input. We addressed this research question by examining individual differences in task-free resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) of the superior insula and the anterior IPS regions, and linking them to the individual differences in the average duration of the local and global perceptual phases of an asymmetric bistable stimulus. To ensure that observed RSFC signatures are stimulusspecific and are not inherent to all bistable stimuli, we used three additional bistable stimuli with different sensory content and involving different perceptual mechanisms. Given the lack of comparable studies, our approach is partly exploratory.\nInterestingly, we found that stronger connectivity of the IPS with the core default mode network (DMN) as well as with extrastriate visual areas was associated with shorter local perceptual phases, i.e. a faster switch to an illusory, global percept. We did not find any resting-state signature of the global phase duration after the switch from local, and we found an opposite association for the insula connectivity with the early visual cortex (i.e. stronger connectivity associated with a longer local percept). Our findings show that several key nodes across different intrinsic networks may work together in shaping the self-generated illusory aspects of perceptual Gestalt experience. They also suggest that the overall tendency to perceive the illusory aspect of the stimulus is driven by two distinct mechanisms, one facilitating/delaying a switch to the global percept, and the other maintaining the global percept in consciousness, with the latter not being captured by the restingstate connectivity patterns."

When viewed continuously, the stimulus can be perceived either as four rotating dot pairs (local non-illusory interpretation) or as two moving illusory squares (global illusory interpretation) with a side length of 5.89\u25e6 v.a. that are formed by long-range grouping of the individual dots (Anstis and Kim 2011). It is well known that parameters of different bistable stimuli correlate with each other, with the degree of correlation depending on the similarity of the involved mechanisms (Carter and Pettigrew 2003; Gallagher and Arnold 2014; Cao et al. 2018). Therefore, to determine which of the effects are specific to the illusory long-range grouping in the Anstis illusion, and which are shared with other types of bistable perception, we used three additional bistable stimuli which are also illustrated in Fig. 1. The Rubin face-vase illusion (side length: 6.9\u25e6 v.a.) can appear either as two faces, which are turned to each other or one vase in the middle (Rubin 1915). In the Coffer illusion (side length: 6.9\u25e6 v.a.), one can either see several rows of squares lined up next to each other or have the impression of several circles suddenly appearing in front of the squares (Norcia 2006). Finally, in the ambiguous structure-from-motion (SFM) illusion (350 black dots with dot size of 0.16\u25e6 v.a., randomly placed within an aperture of 3.15\u25e6 by 6.14\u25e6 and moving at a speed of 0.56\u25e6v.a./s in opposite directions) one\u2019s perception changes between leftward and rightward rotation of a 3D cylinder (Wallach and O\u2019Connell 1953).

The time course of the respective seed was included in the GLM as the regressor of interest. In addition, we used the physiological signals recorded during the restingstate scan to account for physiological noise. Pulse and respiration signals were processed using the MATLAB-based PhysIO toolbox (Kasper et al. 2017) as described in our previous work (Wilding et al. 2022). In brief, the physiological data were aligned to the fMRI time series, preprocessed using a peak detection algorithm and subsequently RETROICOR phase expansion (Glover et al. 2000) was applied. The 18 resulting regressors were then downsampled to a reference slice of each volume and added to the GLM as nuisance regressors. To account for headmotion induced artifacts, six motion regressors were added to the GLM.\nIndividual beta estimates for the seed time course regressor, which represent the functional connectivity of the seed with each cortical surface location, were taken to the second-level group analysis. The group analysis consisted of the whole-brain regression with mean dominance durations (geometric mean) of each percept as predictor (X) and connectivity maps as data (Y). Group results were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Monte Carlo simulation method with a cluster-forming threshold of P < 0.01 and a cluster significance level of P < 0.05 (twosided), with an additional Bonferroni correction for two spaces (left and right hemisphere surface) of the cluster-level P-value. For the Monte Carlo simulation method, white noise is smoothed, thresholded, and then clusters are extracted. After numerous iterations, a distribution of cluster sizes under the null hypothesis is estimated. This is then used to compute the P-value of the actually observed cluster (see Greve and Fischl 2018). The attribution of significant clusters to the resting-state networks was performed using the Schafer parcellation with 400 parcels (Schaefer et al. 2018). Finally, Cohen\u2019s d effect sizes were calculated for each significant cluster by dividing the contrast value by the residual standard deviation. The peak value for each cluster was then extracted.\nOur previous study showed that a joint activity increase in the IPS and the insula precedes the subsequent global perception of an individual (Wilding et al. 2022), suggesting perception-related covariation of activity in the two areas. Therefore, in addition to performing a seed-based functional connectivity analysis for each seed separately, we performed the unshared functional connectivity analysis by adding time courses of both seeds into the same first-level GLM. This allowed us to account for RSFC that is common to the two seeds and examine their unique connectivity targets.\nFig. 2. Correlations between geomean durations of the two interpretations for each bistable illusion. SFM, Coffer and Rubin\u2019s illusions show strong correlations between percepts. The durations for the local and global interpretation in the Anstis illusion display a much weaker association that accordingly does not reach statistical significance."

This information is important because strongly correlated dominance durations may manifest themselves as similar connectivity maps in our second-level group analysis (see below).\nFor all but the Anstis illusion, strongest correlations were observed for dominance durations between percepts within the same illusion (Table 1). Interestingly, we observed a much weaker association between the durations of the illusory (global) and non-illusory (local) interpretation of the Anstis illusion (r = 0.26, P = 0.06). Further comparison of the magnitude of inter-percept correlations using the R-based cocor function (Diedenhofen and Musch 2015) based on the approach proposed by Steiger (1980), revealed a significant difference between Anstis and the other three illusions (all P \u2264 0.002), but no significant difference between the remaining three (all P \u2265 0.41; see Supplementary Table S5 for full statistical details). These results suggest that the two perceptual interpretations in this stimulus are governed by independent perceptual and neural mechanisms (Fig. 2).

In line with previous findings, our data revealed that the global interpretation was perceived over longer periods than the local one in each of the four trials. Crucially, however, durations were not changing over trials, which suggests that participants already reached a more stable global percept due to the exercise run before the experimental block (see Supplementary Fig. S2). A two-way repeated measures ANOVA with factors \u2018percept type\u2019 (global, local) and \u2018trial number\u2019 (1\u20134) confirmed that there was a significant main effect of percept type (F(1, 440) = 55.07, P < 0.01), but no significant effect of trial number (F(3,440) = 0.49, P = 0.69) and no significant interaction between percept type and trial number in the behavioral data (F(3,440) = 0.53, P = 0.66).\nFinally, we compared periods when both buttons were released (i.e., when participants were unsure of their percept) across illusions.

An additional analysis using the median instead of the geometric mean of percept durations (which we used to reduce the effect of extreme values) revealed similar results for the IPS, which confirms that our results are independent from the choice of data transformation, whereas the results for the insula did not reach significance (see Supplementary Fig. S3). Unshared functional connectivity of the insula and IPS seeds To further test whether the above pattern of results is free of shared connectivity between seed regions, we conducted an additional regression analysis with \u2018unshared\u2019 functional connectivity of the insula and the IPS by adding the time courses of both seed regions into the same first-level GLM. This analysis,\npresented in Fig. 4(B) and Supplementary Table S4, showed that the main connectivity clusters precuneus/PCC, IPL, and the extrastriate cortex for the IPS remain, even after considering unique connectivity contribution of each seed region at every cortical location. For the insula, however, none of the original clusters remained significant, implying that most of them appeared due to its joint connectivity with the IPS. Interestingly, however, after accounting for IPS connectivity, we did observe a positive relationship between insula connectivity with bilateral striate and extrastriate areas and the local percept duration (see Fig. 4B and Supplementary Table S3). This result suggests that insula and IPS independently correlate with the visual cortex during the resting state, and that adding them into the same functional connectivity analysis allows to disentangle their contributions."

RSFC correlates of bistable perception dynamics have also been reported, with resting-state fluctuations and connectivity being predictive of switching speed with conventional bistable stimuli (Baker et al. 2015; Mao et al. 2020). In the current study, we demonstrate that RSFC contains more than just a signature of perceptual stability or switching speed. Using a special type of bistable stimulus with an illusory and a nonillusory interpretation, we were able to distill the specific connectivity signatures of self-generated, illusory aspects of perception, and specifically of the readiness of an individual to switch to an illusory interpretation of the sensory input.\nIn our previous study, we used a slow event-related paradigm with long inter-stimulus intervals and brief stimulus presentations to show that the global stimulus interpretation is preceded by increased activity within the superior insula and the IPS (Wilding et al. 2022). Our current findings extend these results by demonstrating that IPS and insula connectivity with other regions is associated with the way participants perceive the Anstis stimulus not only in a moment-to-moment manner, but also as an individual trait. In other words, individual connectivity strength of these areas with several nodes of the default mode and the visual network is associated with the individual tendency for switching to an illusory percept."

            "text": "We found that interactions between the IPS and the core DMN, as well as the extrastriate cortex, are related to how soon an individual abandons the local non-illusory interpretation and switches to the illusory alternative. Importantly, the association of these IPS connectivity targets with local percept duration remained even when insula connectivity with these areas was accounted for. The anterior IPS is well known to play a major role in bistable perception and in representing illusory aspects of perceptual experience (Britz et al. 2009; Kanai et al. 2010; Knapen et al. 2011; Zaretskaya et al. 2013; Grassi et al. 2018; Arsenovic et al. 2022). An intriguing question is why specifically the interaction of the IPS with parts of the DMN, mainly the precuneus/PCC and the IPL, is linked to how soon participants switch to the global percept. The DMN is typically thought to be responsible for selfgenerated and internally oriented cognition, being disengaged during any kind of sensory processing (Andrews-Hanna et al. 2014). However, multiple studies demonstrated that the DMN is active not only during rest, but also during sensory tasks requiring a disengagement from the current sensory input and/or a reliance on prior experience, such as delayed match to sample task or contextual priming (Smallwood et al. 2013; Konishi et al. 2015; Yeshurun et al. 2017; Gonz\u00e1lez-Garc\u00eda et al. 2018; Murphy et al. 2018; Sormaz et al. 2018). The type of processing involved in such tasks has been termed perceptual decoupling (Schooler et al. 2011). The results of this processing are subsequently integrated with the current sensory input.\nYeshurun et al. (2017) were able to demonstrate this notion of the DMN\u2019s role in integrating extrinsic sensory information with prior intrinsic models. They provided subjects with diverging contextual information before presenting them with a story, which could consequently be interpreted in two different ways. Interestingly, neural activity within DMN regions was more similar within subjects sharing a certain interpretation of the story\ncompared to subjects who interpreted the story in a different way. These findings suggest comparable neural patterns within the DMN in subjects sharing an interpretation of external events, which was guided by prior contextual information (Yeshurun et al. 2017). In light of these findings, we suggest that a faster switch toward global illusory perception in our study may be mediated by a similar DMN-based perceptual decoupling mechanism. Increased functional connectivity between the IPS and the DMN allows the brain to disengage from the current sensory input that is reflected in the local stimulus interpretation, and to produce a more complex internally generated global illusory percept.\nOur finding that the DMN is involved in shaping subjective visual experience is thus consistent with the emerging view of the DMN being situated at the top of the processing hierarchy (Margulies et al. 2016). The DMN is thought to represent the most abstract and complex mental content, and is considered to be the source of experience and knowledge-based priors that are integrated with the current perceptual input (Smallwood et al. 2021; Yeshurun et al. 2021). It can therefore provide abstract information about the illusory percept to the visual areas and the IPS. Interestingly, similar interactions between the DMN and other intrinsic networks are thought to underlie hallucinatory experiences (Alderson-Day et al. 2016), confirming the proposed commonalities between illusions and hallucinations (Pearson and Westbrook 2015).\nInterestingly, apart from the DMN areas, we also found IPS connectivity with visual clusters of the extrastriate cortex to be associated with how soon the local percept will be abandoned. These visual clusters are located outside of the primary visual cortex and are not part of any topographic visual area (Wang et al. 2015). The location of these clusters is similar to the location of the lateral occipital complex (LOC), which is known for its role in processing real and illusory objects (Grill-Spector et al. 2001; Martinez et al. 2007; Cichy et al. 2011). Our results imply that connectivity of the IPS with the DMN on the one hand, and with the LOC on the other hand, together favor a faster switch to a more complex, grouped stimulus interpretation. Although the IPS-DMN connectivity may represent the self-generated, internal aspect of the global percept, the IPS-LOC connectivity may represent its perceptual object-like qualities."

            "text": "For the insula, on the other hand, a positive relationship between the local percept duration and insula connectivity with visual areas emerged after accounting for IPS connectivity. Being a part of the salience network, insula is thought to play an important role in increasing an individual\u2019s receptivity for upcoming sensory stimulation (Sadaghiani et al. 2009; Sterzer and Kleinschmidt 2010). In our previous work, we observed stronger insula activity immediately before a global percept was experienced compared to a local one. In combination with previous findings that show similar insula effects in detection and conscious perception paradigms, these results suggest an involvement of the salience network in more efficient processing of the sensory input. This can lead to successful target detection, improved motion discrimination, and a generation of a more complex illusory percept (Hesselmann et al. 2008a, 2008b; Sadaghiani et al. 2009; Huang et al. 2021; Wilding et al. 2022). Our current result shows that when insula\u2019s connectivity is studied as a trait, its connectivity with visual areas is positively associated with a tendency to perceive the local stimulus interpretation for longer periods of time. We speculate that individuals with stronger connectivity between\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /cercor/article/33/11/7175/7043311 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 13 January 2024\nthe salience network and the early visual cortex may experience the external sensory input as more salient. This could delay the onset of the global interpretation, which, in contrast, requires perceptual decoupling. This explanation, however, remains speculative and should be tested thoroughly in future studies to determine its validity."

            "text": "It is somewhat surprising that our analysis revealed primarily the resting-state correlates of the local percept duration but not the global one. Unlike most bistable stimuli that show a strong correlation between the durations of the two percepts across individuals (see Table 1 and Fig. 2), the correlation between global and local percept duration for the Anstis illusion was unexpectedly weak. In a typical bistable paradigm, the two possible interpretations are thought to be governed by the same mechanisms of mutual inhibition and adaptation (Moreno-Bote et al. 2007, 2010; Shpiro et al. 2007; Alais 2012). The weak correlation between percepts of the Anstis stimulus indicates that the mechanisms that determine the average duration for each of them may be different. It is possible that, although the duration of the local percept is determined by factors like adaptation and evidence accumulation, the ability of an individual to maintain the global percept in consciousness may be related to other factors such as working memory capacity or the amount of experience with the stimulus. The latter is known to change within an individual over time (Anstis and Kim 2011), and although we did not find this effect in our data, we can not rule out that the global percept duration was changing on a longer time frame. We also cannot rule out that the duration of the global percept may be better reflected in aspects of brain structure rather than function (Kanai et al. 2010, 2011)."

            "text": "Finally, the findings of this study must be seen in light of some limitations. First, although our findings show a clear relationship between perceptual duration and brain activity, our study has correlational character and does not allow any assumptions to be made regarding the directionality of effects. Future studies using paradigms that manipulate one of the variables (e.g., brain activity) and measure the impact on the other (e.g., perception), or vice-versa, are needed to uncover the causal nature behind these brain\u2013behavior relationships.\nSecond, following up on our previous study (Wilding et al. 2022), in this paper, we aimed to determine whether the brain regions that show elevated activity before illusory perception in an experimental setting would also be associated with the tendency for illusory perception through their RSFC patterns. The scarcity of studies on the topic and our limited understanding of the mechanisms underlying the brain substrates associated with individual differences in the perception of bistable illusions prevented us from formulating a more concrete hypothesis. Hence, this study has a partially exploratory nature and its outcomes should be regarded as rather descriptive. Future studies could test the role of IPS and insula connections identified here in a more hypothesis-driven manner."

Specifically, subjective aspects of perception are associated with\nthe strength of interactions between the anterior IPS, the nodes of the DMN core, and the extrastriate cortex. This interaction may allow an individual to disengage from the sensory input and shorten the time it takes until they can perceive the illusory interpretation of the stimulus. Conversely, the strength of insula\u2019s interaction with the early visual areas is associated with longer time periods until the illusory interpretation onset. Overall, our results point to an important role of cooperation between a set of areas that are distributed across key intrinsic networks in shaping an individual\u2019s subjective, illusory aspects of perception."
