INTRODUCTION\nTo reduce carbon emissions, electrical power systems are increasingly incorporating renewable generation resources into the energy mix. These resources are often dependent on weather inputs and, as a result, they behave stochastically in the short and long terms, posing planning and operational challenges. Including stochastic fluctuations in existing power system models is technically challenging, and recent efforts have been made to introduce probabilistic analysis techniques in power flow and dynamic simulation [1].\nIn this work, we are concerned with quantifying the uncertainty in dynamics when the model is forced by a stochastic process. Milano and Za\u0301rate-Min\u0303ano [2] introduced a new formulation to model the differential-algebraic dynamic equation (DAE) as a stochastic-algebraic differential equation (SDAE) and used Ohrnstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes to represent the stochastic fluctuations in the power grid. The OU process was also determined in [3] to be a good candidate for modeling stochastic fluctuations of the load in the short term when measured with a Phasor Measurement Unit. Moreover, OU processes were recently used to study the impact of correlated stochastic processes in dynamic performance [4].\nWhile these studies highlight the importance of quantifying the effect of stochasticity in power system dynamics, this task is computationally demanding. Stochastic trajectories can be simulated using standard numerical techniques such as Euler-Maruyama [5]. However, complete characterization of the state probability distribution function (PDF) over time is technically challenging. Due to the curse of dimensionality,\nThis material was based upon work supported by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Science, Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) under Contract DE-AC02-06CH11347.

We also acknowledge partial support by the US National Science Foundation (NSF) through grants DGE 1752814 to Tyler E. Maltba.\nstandard (multilevel) Monte Carlo (MC) methods cannot be used to fully characterize the PDF except for low-dimensional systems. Characterization of the PDF evolution is sometimes possible by fully (numerically) integrating the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) [6], but is also limited to low-dimensional systems. Moreover, other methods such as polynomial chaos and stochastic finite elements (e.g., [7]) often do not provide any computational speed-up if the system\u2019s noise is characterized by a short temporal correlation length (see the references in [8]).\nOutside of the power systems community, novel machine learning techniques for partial differential equations (PDEs) have been used to efficiently learn evolution equations for PDFs of system states. We refer to such equations as PDF equations, and unlike the FPE [9], many are unclosed. Particularly for low-dimensional systems, there has been recent success in learning PDEs for the full joint PDF of all system states [10]. However, since many power systems are highdimensional, there is a need for new methodologies. For the purpose of forward uncertainty quantification, it is often sufficient to study low-dimensional, or even scalar quantities of a high-dimensional system.\nIn this paper, we develop a data-driven method to learn reduced-order PDF (RO-PDF) equations for the PDFs of realvalued quantities of interest (QOI). The resulting PDEs are linear, one-dimensional, and easily solvable with standard numerical schemes. We show that the unknown terms can be learned from relatively few1 MC simulations of the underlying high-dimensional system, meaning that the method is scalable and does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality to the same extent as traditional methods.\nIn Section II, we introduce a stochastic power model and discuss how to account for correlation between the driving stochastic (noise) processes in the model. The methodology for learning RO-PDF equations for real-valued QOI in the stochastic power model is discussed in Section III. Accuracy and scalability of the method is successfully tested on the multi-machine classical model with stochastic power injections modeled by correlated OU processes in Section IV.\n1This terminology refers to the number of simulations required by the method being only a small fraction of those needed for a fully converged Monte Carlo method.\nar X\niv :2\n20 7.\n13 31\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\n7 Ju\nl 2 02\n2"

This is often achieved by integrating a semi-explicit index-1 DAE system\nx\u0307 = g(x,y, t) , 0 = h(x,y, t) . (1)\nTo account for time-varying, uncertain processes such as renewable generation or load injections, it is possible to augment this system with a stochastic differential equation (SDE) [2], which we call the noise model. We use an n-dimensional Ito\u0302 SDE driven by independent Wiener processes [4]. They have the general form\nd\u03b7(t) = a(\u03b7(t))dt+ b(\u03b7(t)) dw(t), (2)\nwhere a : Rn \u2192 Rn and b : Rn \u2192 Rn are respectively the drift and diffusion terms of the SDE, and w \u2208 Rn is a standard n-dimensional Wiener processes. In addition, w is a zeromean Gaussian process with stationary, independent Gaussian increments and continuous paths. The notation represents the element-wise Hadamard product. The n-dimensional OU process is a commonly used noise model taking the form of (2).\nFollowing [4] we generalize the noise model (2) to be driven by a Gaussian process v \u2208 Rn (instead of w) whose components are correlated. Such a process v can be constructed as a linear combination of n uncorrelated Wiener processes\u2013it has a symmetric correlation matrix R \u2208 Rn\u00d7n with elements Rij . The increments of v can be written in terms of the increments of w (see [11] and the reference therein) as\ndv = Cdw,\nwhere C \u2208 Rn\u00d7n such that R = CC>. In general, R can be a stationary stochastic process; however, we restrict R to be constant and positive-definite for computational efficiency. Therefore, the Cholesky decomposition of R is unique, i.e., the (constant) lower triangular C is unique.\nThe noise model (2) generalized to be driven by the process v can still be written it terms of w. We have\nd\u03b7(t) = a(\u03b7(t))dt+ b(\u03b7(t)) dv(t) = a(\u03b7(t))dt+ b(\u03b7(t)) Cdw(t). (3)\nIntroducing \u03b7 in (3) to the differential part of (1), the model can be rewritten as an Ito\u0302 SDE of higher dimension, taking the general form\nd\u03b6(t) = \u00b5(\u03b6(t), t)dt+ \u03c3(\u03b6(t), t)dW (t),\n\u03b6(0) = \u03b60. (4)\nThe solution \u03b6 to (4) is an RN -valued (N > n) stochastic process whose components are made up of the components of x, y, and \u03b7. The initial condition \u03b60 may also be random, i.e., an N -dimensional random vector with joint PDF f\u03b60(z) : RN \u2192 R+. The driving process W of (4) is a standard M -dimensional Wiener process. The (random) initial\nstate \u03b60, drift \u00b5 : RN \u2192 RN , and diffusion \u03c3 : RN \u2192 RN\u00d7M satisfy conditions guaranteeing the existence and uniqueness of a strong solution to (4) [12]."

It is well-known that f\u03b6(z; t) satisfies the deterministic N -dimensional linear PDE called the FPE, given by\n\u2202f\u03b6 \u2202t + N\u2211 i=1 \u2202 \u2202zi (\u00b5i(z, t)f\u03b6) = N\u2211 i=1 M\u2211 j=1 \u22022 \u2202zi\u2202zj (Dij(z, t)f\u03b6)\nf\u03b6(z; 0) = f\u03b60(z), (5)\nwhere D = 12\u03c3\u03c3 >.\nIn general, FPEs do not admit closed-form analytic solutions, and (5) must be solved numerically. Hence, when the dimension N is large, (5) is a high-dimensional PDE. While there have been recent advancements in numerical solutions to high-dimensional PDEs, such as tensor train methods (see [13] among others), they are not capable of handling systems whose dimension is in the thousands, as is common in power systems. Hence, numerically solving the FPE can be intractable. However, for the purpose of forward uncertainty propagation, it is often sufficient to consider low-dimensional QOI. A low-dimensional PDE for the PDF of that quantity (i.e., a RO-PDF equation) can then be learned and efficiently solved with standard numerical methods. We focus on realvalued QOI.\nConsider a stochastic process (for the QOI) U(\u03b6(t)) \u2208 R, where U : RN \u2192 R is a phase space function guaranteeing the existence of single-point PDF fU of U(\u03b6(t)) for all t \u2265 0. Let u \u2208 R be a phase space variable for U(\u03b6(t)). Then fU (u; t) is found by integrating f\u03b6(z; t) against the Dirac delta function \u03b4(\u00b7):\nfU (u; t) = \u222b RN \u03b4(u\u2212 U(z))f\u03b6(z; t)dz.\nMultiplying the FPE (5) by \u03b4(u\u2212U(z)) and integrating with respect to z gives\n\u2202fU \u2202t + N\u2211 i=1 \u222b RN \u03b4(u\u2212 U(z)) \u2202 \u2202zi (\u00b5i(z, t)f\u03b6)dz\n= N\u2211 i=1 N\u2211 j=1 \u222b RN \u03b4(u\u2212 U(z)) \u2202 2 \u2202zi\u2202zj (Dij(z, t)f\u03b6)dz,\nfU (u; 0) = \u222b RN \u03b4(u\u2212 U(z))f\u03b60(z)dz. (6)\nThis equation for fU (u; t) is unclosed since there are terms depending on the generally unknown f\u03b6(z; t), and not on fU (u; t) alone.\nWe focus on the case where the QOI are the scalar components of \u03b6 (i.e., when U(\u03b6) = \u03b6j for j = 1, . . . , N ). By\nassuming f\u03b6(z; t) and its partial derivatives decay fast enough at \u00b1\u221e when the phase space is unbounded, equation (6) can be simplified. Letting z\u2212j = [z1, . . . , zj\u22121, zj+1, . . . , zN ]>, the unclosed marginal PDF equation for f\u03b6j (zj ; t) is\n\u2202f\u03b6j \u2202t + \u222b RN\u22121 \u2202 \u2202zj (\u00b5j(z, t)f\u03b6)dz\u2212j\n= \u222b RN\u22121 \u22022 \u2202z2j (Djj(z, t)f\u03b6)dz\u2212j ,\nf\u03b6j (zj ; 0) = \u222b RN\u22121 f\u03b60(z)dz\u2212j . (7)\nWriting the joint PDF f\u03b6 as the product of the marginal and conditional PDFs (i.e., f\u03b6 \u2261 f\u03b6jf\u03b6\u2212j |\u03b6j ), the integrals in (7) are conditional expectations, yielding\n\u2202f\u03b6j \u2202t + \u2202\n\u2202zj\n( E [ \u00b5j(\u03b6(t)) \u2223\u2223 \u03b6j(t) = zj]f\u03b6j) = \u22022\n\u2202z2j\n( E [ Djj(\u03b6(t)) \u2223\u2223 \u03b6j(t) = zj]f\u03b6j) (8) with vanishing (or zero-flux) boundary conditions. If \u00b5j(\u00b7) and Djj(\u00b7) are (at least partially) separable in zj , then the marginal PDF equation (8) can be further simplified, i.e., made to be more physics-informed. Typical expansion-based closures of (8) such as Kubo\u2019s cumulant expansion [14] are computationally intractable. Hence, there is a need for direct data-driven estimation of the conditional expectations. We learn such conditional expectations, which we call regression functions, from relatively few MC realizations of (4).\nTo solve (8), one must choose a numerical scheme such as a finite difference, volume, or element method, and a computational mesh/grid. We consider uniform spatial meshes with domains large enough to ensure that the PDE solutions do not interact with the computational boundaries. These boundaries are chosen based on a small number of SDE sample paths. We then approximate the vanishing boundary conditions with homogeneous Dirichlet conditions with negligible effects.\nThe cell size \u2206zj of the spatial mesh can be manually set a priori, or treated as a hyper-parameter to be tuned to balance computational efficiency and truncation error of the discretization. However, like the mesh boundaries, we choose \u2206zj based on sample paths. In fact, we have found appropriate cell sizes can be computed via rule-of-thumb bandwidth estimators typically used for kernel density estimation (KDE).\nOnce a spatial grid is chosen, regression functions in (8) are estimated while numerically time stepping the PDE. At discrete times, the regression functions are treated as phase space functions and estimated at the discrete spatial locations required by the PDE discretization.\nFor some SDE systems, including some power system models, the regression functions may vary nonlinearly in time, but remain linear in space. In such instances, standard linear regression methods can be employed with little costs. When parametric regression is inappropriate, several nonparametric methods such as moving averages, splines, local polynomial regression, neural networks, etc., can be employed [15]. Out\nof these, the first two were successively used in [16] for nonlinear ODEs with random initial conditions. However, we found Gaussian local linear regression (LLR) to have a more desirable trade-off between costs and accuracy. LLR has only a single hyper-parameter (the kernel bandwidth), which can be efficiently estimated with standard cross validation (CV) methods such as k-fold CV [15]. Although beyond the scope of this paper, and similar to the approach in [16], it is worth noting that information content of the data used for regression can be measured by deriving a new system of PDEs equivalent to (8). Solving the system with the same data-driven approach and comparing its solution to that of (8) can determine if more useful data is needed."

In general, the drift and diffusion of \u03b7 \u2208 Rn may vary across generators, but we take them to be constants \u03b8 = 1 and \u03b1 = 0.05 for simplicity. \u03b7 is initialized with the Gaussian random vector \u03b7(0) \u223c N (0, \u03b12R). We initialize the system around an equilibrium point by solving the deterministic power flow with Matpower [18]. We then treat each voltage magnitude v\u0302i of machine i as a folded Gaussian random parameter by taking v\u0302i(0) \u223c |N (vi, (0.05v\u0304)2)|, where vi is the constant equilibrium voltage of machine i and v\u0304 = 1n \u2211n i=1 vi is the average over all equilibrium voltages.

In all of the experiments, we set wR = Hi = Di = 1 for all i and simulate (9) up to the final time Tf = 10.\nThe initial speeds and angles of (9) are treated as random variables and samples of their distributions are computed by burning in MC simulations of (9) in the following manner. We first take \u03c9i(0) = wR and \u03b4i(0) as the equilibrium points from solving the deterministic power flow equations with Matpower. The SDE (9), with random v\u0302i and \u03b7 included, is then simulated until time Tf . The resulting realizations of \u03c9i and \u03b4i at time\nTf are treated as samples of the random variables \u03c9i(0) and \u03b4i(0). Hence, we can think of (9) as being initialized close to equilibrium, albeit stochastic. In our experiments, we consider three test cases: WSCC 9-Bus System, IEEE 30-Bus System, and IEEE 57-Bus System, which from here on will be referred to as Case 9, Case 30, and Case 57, respectively."

We consider three choices for the correlation matrix R = CC> of the noise \u03b7 in (9). We denote the different choices of R by RU for uncorrelated, RE for exponentially correlated, and RC for constant correlation. In the uncorrelated cases, RU is the identity matrix. For constant correlation, for all connected buses i 6= j, we set RCij = R C ji = 0.44 for Case 9, and R C ij = R C ji = 0.36 for Case 30 and Case 57.

The latter is achieved by introducing a single line failure for each of the three test cases. In our experiments we remove line 8-9 for Case 9, line 6-8 for Case 30, and line 36-37 for Case 57.\nThe initial conditions for (10) and (12) are computed via MC simulations as described in the paragraphs following equation (9). These realizations are then post-processed with Gaussian KDE. The number of MC simulations used to compute the initial conditions is restricted to be no more than the maximum number of those needed to learn the regression functions. In non-equilibrium, i.e., when a line failure is present, we use the same initial conditions for (10) and (12) as those used when no line failure is present.\nWhen (9) is in equilibrium, i.e., no line failure, the regression functions for both the speed and angle RO-PDF equations are linear for all observed t > 0; therefore, linear regression is used. This is also true for the angles even when a line failure is present. In non-equilibrium, the regression functions for the speeds are nonlinear at early times; hence, we use Gaussian LLR with 10-fold CV for kernel bandwidth selection. After some time, the systems transition to a new equilibrium and the regression functions become linear. We manually select the time at which the regression is switched from LLR to linear regression; however, efficient hypothesis testing [15] can be used to automatically select the transition time. Fig. 1 gives the learned regression function m(z; t) in (11) at various observed times for \u03c94(t) in Case 57 with a line failure and R = RC . Notice how m(z; t) becomes linear as time progresses. By time Tf = 10, m(z; t) is nearly constant in t and linear in z such that the advection coefficient in (10) is approximately zero. Hence, the marginal PDF solution f\u03c94(z; t) is close to steady-state.\nFor each test case, we calculate the \u201ctrue\u201d marginal PDFs of\neach speed (i.e., f\u03c9i(z; t) for all i) at discrete times by 30,000 MC simulations of (9) with Gaussian KDE and Silverman\u2019s rule. These PDFs are treated as yardsticks, and the number of simulations used to compute them was determined by a convergence study. To test the scalability of the RO-PDF method, we specify a 5% error tolerance. For each speed, we then calculate the minimum number of MC simulations needed for its marginal PDF equation solution to be within the tolerance. Here, relative error is measured against the yardstick solution via the L2 norm over space and time. We take the total (speed) sample count for our method to be the sum (over all speeds) of the number of MC simulations needed. We repeat this process for the MC method with KDE. That is, for every speed, we find the minimum number of simulations needed for the marginal PDF computed via KDE to be within 5% relative error of the yardstick solution, and then sum over all speeds to get a total MC method sample count. Fig. 2 shows for all test cases, as the system\u2019s dimensionality increases, the total (speed) sample count, and therefore cost of MC with KDE increases considerably faster than that of the RO-PDF method. We omit the results for the angles because, in this case, the ROPDF method outperforms MC with KDE by multiple orders of magnitude. All MC simulations of (9), regardless of the method or use, were computed via Milstein\u2019s scheme with \u2206t = 0.005."

            "text": "Most real-world power system models are inherently stochastic and high-dimensional, and the underlying stochastic noise processes can be correlated. Quantifying the uncertainty in such dynamics is challenging, and many, if not most methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality when it comes to characterizing PDFs of system states. The method of ROPDF equations shows great promise in alleviating the curse of dimensionality for high-dimensional stochastic dynamical systems when it is sufficient to study the uncertainty of lowdimensional QOI. We demonstrated this for scalar QOI in the multi-machine classical model (9) with stochastic power injection driven by both correlated and uncorrelated OU processes.\nWe plan to continue this work by considering larger systems (e.g., IEEE 300-BUS System, TAMU 2K, etc.) in order to more rigorously study the scalability of the method. Additionally, more complex/realistic models than (9), such as those containing governor equations and detailed generator models, can be incorporated into the RO-PDF framework, as well as nonlinear and vector-valued QOI. We are particularly interested in using this framework to quantify uncertainty of cascade failures. Lastly, real-world data can be used to achieve realistic estimates for the correlation between the underlying noise processes, i.e., the correlation matrix R."
