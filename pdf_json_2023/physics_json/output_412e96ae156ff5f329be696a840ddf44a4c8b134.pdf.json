Genotoxins cause DNA lesions, which, if not repaired correctly, lead to mutations or 87 genomic aberrations that threaten cell viability16. The DNA damage response (DDR), a network 88 of damage signaling pathways and DNA repair pathways working in concert, promotes the 89 sensing and repair of DNA lesions and prevents genomic instability. While the general 90 mechanisms of this network have been well described, much of this network complexity has not 91 been elucidated. Specifically, CGI profiling of genotoxins against DDR genes may provide better 92 understanding of synthetic lethal interactions that can be exploited for combination therapies, or 93 mechanisms of resistance to chemotherapies. 94 95 Here, we propose a chemical CRISPR screening platform that takes advantage of a 96 compressed, DDR-focused library. The reduction in costs, particularly for cell culture reagents 97 and next-generation sequencing, allows for a scalable approach to screening a large number of 98 compounds17. We performed 5 proof-of-principle screens against genotoxins or compounds that 99 interact with the DDR network. Our screens recapitulated expected CGIs at a similar signal-to-100 noise ratio (SNR) compared to genome-wide screens and showed that CGIs are enriched in 101 genes related to the characterized mechanism of action of a particular compound. Notably, our 102 scalable screening approach also discovered previously unreported CGIs. Moreover, 103 intermediate time point CGI data revealed novel time-resolved dependency of DNA repair 104 pathways. 105 106 Results 107 Development of a targeted library for scalable CRISPR screens 108 Previous work in S. cerevisiae demonstrated that mutants covering a small subset of the 109 genome were able to generate chemical-genetic fingerprints representative of a compound\u2019s 110 MoA5. With the long-term goal of establishing an analogous, highly scalable chemical genetic 111 screening platform for human cells, we developed a proof-of-concept small, custom sgRNA 112 lenti-library (hereafter referred to as the \u201ctargeted library\u201d) for efficient chemical genetic screens. 113 Our targeted library was designed to target four general categories of genes (Fig. 1a): well-114 characterized DNA damage response genes (n = 349), genes that captured the greatest 115 variance across published CRISPR screens (n = 100), genes that captured subtle fitness 116 defects in CRISPR screen data (n = 216), and genes that have a high degree of genetic 117 interactions, or frequent interactors (n = 463) (see Methods for details on each category). 118 Overall, the targeted library contained 3,033 sgRNAs targeting 1,011 genes (3 independent 119 sgRNAs/gene). The sgRNA library was optimally selected from a pool of guides from the 120 genome-wide Toronto KnockOut version 3.0 (TKOv3) library, which contains ~71,000 guides 121 targeting ~18,000 genes (4 independent sgRNAs/gene)18. Selection of library genes was based 122 on previous screen data and quality metrics (see Methods). The small library size enabled each 123 replicate screen to be conducted on a series of single 15-cm tissue culture plates while being 124 sufficient for maintaining a robust 1000X representation of each sgRNA in this scalable 125 experimental format, compared to the 250-400X representation commonly used in other 126\n4\npublished CRISPR screens12. Overall, we estimate that this library provides a >20-fold increase 127 in the number of compounds or cell lines that can be screened for the same cost. 128 129 Scalable CRISPR chemical screen workflow 130 To evaluate the utility of our targeted CRISPR library, we performed a set of 5 proof-of-principle 131 pooled CRISPR-Cas9 chemical screens in the hTERT-immortalized RPE-1 TP53 knockout cell 132 line expressing a Flag-tagged Cas9 protein (Fig. 1b). Screens were conducted in a TP53-null 133 background, as Cas9 cutting can induce a p53-mediated DNA damage response and cell cycle 134 arrest, potentially masking the identification of essential gene dropouts in screens19\u201321. The 5 135 compounds (bortezomib - BTZ, hydroxyurea - HU, camptothecin - CPT, olaparib - OLA, and 136 colchicine - COL) were selected due to: 1) the well-characterized protein and bioprocess targets 137 of the compounds, and 2) the fact that genome-wide screen data for these compounds were 138 either already publicly available or generated by us for comparison (Fig. 1c, Table 1). To 139 determine the optimal dosage for these screens, we conducted a pilot screen with bortezomib at 140 IC50 and IC20 (inhibitory concentrations determined after 3 days of exposure to compound by 141 CellTiterGlo\u00ae cell viability assay). Dosing at IC20 (20% decrease in cell viability relative to 142 vehicle treated only cells) vs. IC50 revealed similar CGIs (Fig. S1). While there was no definitive 143 evidence to suggest using one dosage over the other, we reasoned that the IC20 dosage 144 allowed a sufficiently large window to capture gene knockouts that either sensitize or suppress 145 the compound\u2019s effect on cell viability. In addition, the lower dosage ensured that enough cells 146 could be passaged and collected throughout the length of the screen. The remaining proof-of-147 principle screens were performed with IC20 drug concentrations, as previously described\n22. 148 149 The NGS data was processed by an adapted version of a previously described computational 150 tool for scoring CGIs23 (see Methods for details). Briefly, raw read counts were normalized by 151 the sequencing depth of each sample. Guide fitness values were calculated as log2 fold 152 changes (LFCs) at each time point relative to T0 for both untreated (DMSO) and treated 153 (compound) conditions. Gene-level LFCs were calculated by averaging the guide-level LFCs 154 across the 3 guides. CGI scores were quantified as a corrected differential LFC between treated 155 and untreated conditions and scored for statistical significance using a moderated t-test24. 156 157 Screen quality was assessed through multiple metrics. First, we assessed how well the fitness 158 defect data correlated between all pairwise replicates for a given screen (representative 159 example for the T12 Camptothecin screen shown in Fig. 1d). Across all screens, the guide-level 160 LFC data had high correlation among replicates (mean Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient (PCC), 161 r = 0.8, Fig. 1e). Second, to better quantify the reproducibility of compound-specific effects, we 162 assessed the correlation of the CGI values. The mean PCC for the CGI-scores was r = 0.24 163 (Fig. 1e). Given the sparsity of compound-specific effects from CRISPR screens, PCC is not a 164 sensitive metric for assessing reproducibility of CGI scores25. Thus, we used the within-vs-165 between context correlation (WBC) score to quantify how similar CGI scores were among 166 replicate screens relative to other screens25. This metric provided a more accurate 167 representation of the reproducibility of the compound-specific effects, which was high for the 168 majority of replicate screens (mean WBC: 4.85, WBC range: 1.03-8.97, Fig. 1e). In addition, 169 essential genes dropped out as expected throughout the screen, as evaluated by a binary 170\n5\nclassification approach (mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve metric, 171 AUC-ROC = 0.9, Fig. 1f). 172 173 Mapping chemical-genetic interactions with the targeted library 174 CGI scores are used to quantify whether library gene knockouts sensitize (negative CGI) or 175 suppress/mask (positive CGI) a compound\u2019s effect on cell viability. We defined significant CGI 176 hits by using a CGI score (differential LFC) cutoff of greater than 0.7 (for positive CGIs) or less 177 than -0.7 (for negative CGIs) and a false discovery rate (FDR) lower than 10% (Supplementary 178 Table 1). Overall, 623 gene-compound interactions were identified across all time points, and 179 ~40% of the targeted library displayed interactions with at least one of the screened compounds 180 for at least one time point. CGI scores correlate across time points for a given compound and 181 are moderately correlated across the genotoxins (HU, CPT, OLA), reflecting their similar modes 182 of action (Fig. S2). 183 184 Compound-specific CGIs recapitulate expected hits when considering the well-characterized 185 bioprocess or pathway targets of these compounds, as shown on a global heatmap of the CGIs 186 across all screens (Fig. 2a-f, S3-S4). Hydroxyurea, a potent ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor 187 that depletes the dNTP pool and results in stalled replication forks, showed expected strong 188 negative interactions with RAD1, HUS1, and RAD17 (Fig. 2c). The Rad9-Hus1-Rad1 189 heterotrimeric complex (also known as the 9-1-1 complex) is a sliding clamp loaded by a 190 complex containing Rad17 onto the DNA to sense sites of DNA damage and regulate 191 checkpoint signaling pathways26,27. RAD9 was not included in the targeted library, and thus, 192 does not appear as a negative CGI. 193 194 Camptothecin, a selective topoisomerase I inhibitor, and olaparib, a poly (ADP-ribose) 195 polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, both covalently link and trap their respective enzyme targets to 196 DNA, resulting in replication fork stalling and collapse, and DNA damage in the form of double-197 strand breaks28,29. Both compounds showed strong negative interactions with members of the 198 homologous recombination (HR) repair pathway, such as BRCA1, RAD51B, XRCC1, XRCC2, 199 MRE11, RAD50, EME1, MUS81, and RAD54L (Fig. 2d-e). The MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) 200 complex, which has a role in sensing and repair of DNA damage, and Mus81-Eme1 201 endonuclease, which plays a role in processing stalled replication fork intermediates, may both 202 be essential for DNA damage caused by camptothecin and olaparib30,31. All genotoxins 203 screened, including camptothecin, olaparib, and hydroxyurea, exhibit strong negative 204 interactions with CYB5R4, which encodes an oxidoreductase and possible modulator of protein 205 phosphatases, as well as with TIPRL and PPP2R4, which encode proteins that regulate the 206 assembly and disassembly of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) complexes12 (Fig. 2a). These 207 interactions were discovered in the genome-wide screens conducted by Olivieri et al. and 208 recapitulated in our genotoxin scalable screens. 209 210 Colchicine, a beta-tubulin inhibitor that disrupts microtubule assembly and is often used to arrest 211 cells in metaphase32, displayed strong positive interactions with the aforementioned HR genes 212 (along with RAD51D, XRCC3), as well as with DNA replication genes such as GINS4, MCM6, 213 ORC2 (Fig. 2f). For cells arrested in mitosis, depletion of DNA repair and replication genes 214\n6\nwould not decrease the viability of these cells relative to untreated conditions. Interestingly, a 215 group of chromatin remodeling genes (DOT1L, EED, SUZ12, LCMT1, KMT2A) displayed strong 216 negative interactions with colchicine and strong positive interactions with camptothecin (Fig. 2a); 217 these interactions have not been previously reported. EED and SUZ12 are members of the 218 polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which is a histone methyltransferase that represses 219 transcription through methylation of lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27)33. KMT2A encodes a 220 histone methyltransferase that methylates H3K4, DOT1L encodes a lysine methyltransferase 221 that methylates H3K79, and LCMT1 encodes a leucine carboxyl methyltransferase that 222 regulates PP2A methylation. Overall, the proof-of-principle compound screens recapitulated 223 previously reported CGIs and revealed novel CGIs. 224 225 Compound mode-of-action enriched in CGIs 226 We asked whether genes in the compounds\u2019 known modes-of-action were enriched in their CGI 227 hits. To perform this analysis, we first collated the protein targets of each compound (Fig. 3a). 228 For each of these targets, we selected a GO:BP term that best describes the compound MoA, 229 or the biological process targeted by the compound. Next, we investigated whether the genes in 230 this targeted library annotated to these GO:BP terms were overrepresented in the significant 231 hits for each compound screen. To interrogate whether the MoA was generally enriched across 232 all compound screens, we combined compound-hit pairs across all compounds before 233 conducting a statistical test and measuring fold enrichment. Across the set of all compounds\u2019 234 CGI scores, MoA related genes were significantly enriched (fold enrichment = 1.52), with 235 primarily negative CGIs driving this enrichment (Fig. 3b). Further subdividing CGIs into essential 236 and non-essential genes (see Methods), revealed that this enrichment on negative interactions 237 occurred regardless of essentiality status of the gene (Fig. 3c). Specifically, sgRNAs targeting 238 essential genes related to the MoA tended to drop out more quickly in cells exposed to these 239 compounds relative to the control (DMSO) condition. 240 241 The observation of CGIs for essential genes, and in particular, CGIs with essential genes 242 related to the MoA was unexpected. In general, guides targeting essential genes drop out 243 across the length of the screen, which is confirmed by our ROC analysis reflecting 244 discrimination of essential genes from non-essential genes even in control conditions (Fig. 1f). 245 We hypothesized that such interactions could be driven by rare sgRNAs that induce partial loss-246 of-function mutations. This hypothesis would be supported if we see only one of the three 247 sgRNAs driving this interaction, as it is unlikely for all three sgRNAs to cause partial loss-of-248 function mutations in the protein encoded by the gene in question. To test this, we analyzed a 249 total of 13 high-confidence compound - essential gene interactions found in the MoA across all 250 compounds (Fig. S5). By quantifying whether a single sgRNA has an outlier differential log fold 251 change (dLFC) across these 13 interactions, we determined that 11 compound-essential gene 252 interactions were supported by multiple guides while only 2 compound-essential gene 253 interactions were supported by a single sgRNA (Fig 3d-e). These data argue against the 254 hypothesis of partial loss-of-function mutations induced by rare guides. An alternative 255 explanation is that intermediate depletion of essential genes, which would occur early in the 256 screen before wild-type protein pools are completely depleted, may result in differential 257 phenotypes between the compound and control condition. This could result in CGIs in essential 258\n7\ngenes related to the MoA, and one would expect multiple sgRNAs targeting the same essential 259 gene to exhibit similar phenotypes. More experiments are needed to further explore this 260 alternative hypothesis. 261 262 Evaluation of sensitivity and signal-to-noise characteristics of the scalable screen platform 263 We evaluated several aspects of the CGI hits resulting from the scalable screening platform. As 264 a basis for our evaluations, we collected the corresponding genome-wide screen data for these 265 compounds by either: 1) performing genome-wide screens (CPT, OLA, COL), or 2) collecting 266 data from the genotoxin chemical screens from Olivieri et al. (HU, CPT, OLA)12. Raw data 267 collected from both sources of genome-wide screens were scored for CGI hits using an adapted 268 version of a previously described computational pipeline23 (see Methods). Table 1 shows a side-269 by-side comparison of the parameters for each screen source. Notably, the approach to 270 determining compound dosage differed for each screen source, with the Olivieri screens using a 271 lower dosage (IC20 determined over 12 days vs. 3 days for the scalable screens), while our 272 genome-wide screens used a higher dosage at IC50. While the Olivieri screens were performed 273 in the same cell line (hTERT-immortalized RPE-1 TP53 knockout), our genome-wide screens 274 were performed in HAP1 cells, a near-haploid cell line derived from the KBM7 chronic 275 myelogenous leukemia (CML) cell line. While genetic background differences should be 276 considered when interpreting CGIs, we reasoned that a substantial portion of CGIs should be 277 conserved across various cell types. 278 279 Overlap of hits between scalable and genome-wide screens 280\nFirst, we investigated whether the hits from a scalable compound screen overlapped the hits 281 derived from its respective genome-wide screen. Hits for genome-wide screens were scored 282 using the same computational pipeline (see Methods) and were defined with the same cutoffs 283 (|CGI score| > 0.7, FDR < 0.1). Hits must point in the same direction (positive or negative in both 284 the scalable screen and genome-wide screen) to be considered overlapping. We observed 285 statistically significant overlap for all compounds screened (Supplementary Table 2), suggesting 286 that the two approaches produce significantly overlapping CGI profiles. 287 288 Targeted library produces more hits than random subsets of genome-wide library 289 Next, we assessed the degree to which the 1,011 genes selected for the targeted library 290 produced more hits than would be expected of other subsets of the genome. Specifically, we 291 compared the number of significant CGI hits observed from the actual targeted library to 1,000 292 randomly selected gene sets for which we measured the number of hits observed for those 293 genes in the corresponding genome-wide screens (as a proxy for what would have been 294 observed had the library been constructed using each evaluated set of target genes). Each 295 subsetted genome-wide library was rescored using a multiple hypothesis correction reflecting 296 the reduced size (1,011 genes) to enable comparisons with our targeted library hits. As 297 expected given our library design, the observed number of hits recovered from scalable screens 298 generally exceeded the number of hits recovered by these randomly selected simulated libraries 299 (Fig. S6, p < 0.004 for all compounds), suggesting the gene selection strategy (Fig. 1a) indeed 300\n8\nbiased our library towards genes with increased CGI frequency as intended for these 301 compounds. 302 303 Sensitivity of scalable vs. genome-wide approach 304 We then compared the total yield in terms of the number of hits produced by the scalable 305 screens as compared to their corresponding genome-wide screens (Fig. S7). On average, our 306 genome-wide screens produced 240 significant CGIs relative to the 143 significant CGIs 307 discovered on average across the scalable screens at the same effect size threshold and false 308 discovery rate. For the DDR-related compounds, the number of hits for the scalable screen 309 either exceeded the number of hits from our respective genome-wide screen (HU, OLA), or was 310 comparable (CPT). However, this trend was reversed for colchicine, which is expected given 311 that this DDR-focused library is likely to miss hits from a non-genotoxin. This pattern was further 312 reflected when restricting the genome-wide screen data to the genes included in the targeted 313 library, as the scalable screens were more sensitive to identifying hits compared to their 314 respective genome-wide screen (except for COL). In addition, the Olivieri genome-wide 315 screens, which were performed with much lower compound dosage, produced an average of 316 28.3 hits per screen (fewer than our scalable screens). This data suggests that a higher 317 compound dosage for the screen results in a greater number of total hits. 318 319 To directly compare the sensitivity of the two sets of screens on exactly the same genes, we 320 restricted the genome-wide screen data to only the 1,011 genes included in the targeted library 321 (Fig. 4a). We found that the sensitivity of the scalable screens (measured as the number of hits 322 detected relative to the total library size) was higher than the genome-wide screens on average. 323 For example, the average hit rate for scalable screens was 14.1% compared to the hit rate of 324 6.6% for the genome-wide screens (after restricting to the common library genes). Furthermore, 325 the hits unique to the scalable screens were enriched for GO terms related to the MoA for 3 of 326 the 4 compounds compared, including all genotoxins (Supplementary Table 4). This suggested 327 that the expanded representation per sgRNA afforded by the smaller screening format, along 328 with sampling multiple time points across the course of the screen, enabled more sensitive 329 detection of CGIs for this set of genes. In all but one sample (COL, T18), the hit rate for our 330 scalable screens increased with later time sampling. 331 332 Scalable screens have comparable signal-to-noise ratio relative to genome-wide screens 333 Our sensitivity analysis did not account for the identity of each CGI hit, only the total number of 334 hits. To compare the ability of scalable vs. genome-wide screens to distinguish true hits from 335 background noise, we developed an approach to quantify the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The 336 signal was defined as the average CGI effect size across high-confidence \u201cgold-standard\u201d gene 337 hits, which were formed from the intersection of each scalable screen and the corresponding 338 genome-wide screen. The rationale in defining this gold-standard set is that hits in common 339 between the two screening platforms are highly likely to be true positive hits and that both 340 screen types contribute equally to forming this gold standard set such that the resulting SNR 341 measure could be directly compared across platforms. The background noise was defined as 342 the variance across genes with non-significant CGI effects in each assay (see Methods for more 343 details). Figure 4b shows an example SNR comparison for hydroxyurea, where the SNR peaked 344\n9\nat an intermediate time point (T12) and showed comparable SNR across all time points for the 345 scalable screen relative to the genome-wide screen. The SNR peaked at intermediate time 346 points during the scalable screens for multiple compounds, including HU, CPT, OLA, and COL 347 (Fig. 4c), suggesting that the SNR is strongest at time points earlier than the typical T18 348 endpoint used for many published CRISPR screens. All scalable screens showed modest 349 improvement of SNR relative to our genome-wide screens in 3 or more time points (Fig. S8). 350 Both the CPT and OLA scalable screens showed comparable SNR to our corresponding 351 genome-wide screen, while showing weaker SNR compared to the corresponding Olivieri 352 screen (partially explained by the low dosage Olivieri screen, which was more sensitive to 353 negative rather than positive CGIs). These observations generally suggest that scalable screens 354 have comparable SNR relative to genome-wide screens. Furthermore, this SNR analysis 355 suggests that higher SNR can frequently be achieved by sampling earlier time points than is 356 typical for CRISPR screens in human cells (~12 days or less) and that lower compound doses 357 may produce chemical-genetic profiles with fewer hits but higher SNR. 358 359 Intermediate time point CGIs reveal time-resolved dependency of multiple DNA repair pathways 360 To identify if certain pathways or biological processes were enriched in the CGIs of each 361 compound screen, we performed Gene Ontology: Biological Process (GO:BP) enrichment 362 analyses for both scalable and genome-wide screens (Supplementary Table 3, see Methods). 363 For all genotoxin scalable screens (HU, CPT, OLA), we found significant enrichment (FDR < 364 0.2) amongst the hits in GO terms related to the compounds' known MoA (Supplementary Table 365 3). The targeted library resulted in enrichment in more or a similar number of unique MoA-366 related GO terms relative to the genome-wide screens. In contrast, the COL scalable screen did 367 not result in enrichment in the GO terms related to the MoA (tubulin inhibitor) whereas the 368 genome-wide screen did. This is unsurprising given that this DDR-focused library will miss many 369 genes in the MoA of non-genotoxins. Repeating this analysis for hits unique to the scalable 370 screen revealed that, for genotoxins, the MoA was significantly enriched (FDR < 0.2) among 371 these hits (Supplementary Table 4), as described above. This suggests that the scalable 372 screens for genotoxins capture additional functionally relevant hits that were not found in the 373 genome-wide screens. 374 375 To perform a pathway enrichment analysis more suitable for the targeted library, we manually 376 curated 11 DNA repair and replication pathways and derived an enrichment score (see 377 Methods). Genotoxins (HU, CPT, OLA) showed strong enrichment on negative CGIs for DDR 378 and replication stress response genes, as expected (Fig. 5a). The HR pathway was strongly 379 negatively enriched for camptothecin and olaparib, providing evidence that both compounds 380 induced DNA breaks that employed the HR pathway for DNA repair. Interestingly, negative 381 CGIs for camptothecin were enriched for the interstrand crosslink (ICL) repair pathway at T18 382 only. Colchicine negative CGIs were enriched for chromatin remodeling genes, while the 383 positive CGIs were enriched for DNA replication, HR, and ICL pathways. 384 385 Heatmaps of the CGI scores across the compound screens for each specific curated pathway 386 reveal time resolution dependency on DNA repair pathways in response to camptothecin-387 induced damage (Fig. 5b-d, S9). DNA damage recognition proteins, such as XRCC1 and 388\n10\nPARP1, sense and bind to sites of DNA damage before DNA repair begins with DNA 389 polymerase activity. This is supported by the consistent strong negative CGIs of XRCC1 and 390 PARP1 across all time points for the camptothecin screen, and strong negative CGIs with 391 POLE3/4 only at later time points (Fig. 5b). Inspection of the HR genes (ATM, BRCA1, 392 RAD51B, XRCC2, RAD54L, EME1, MUS81) revealed expected negative CGIs with 393 camptothecin (Fig. 5c). Interestingly, many members of the ICL pathway (FANCI, FANCG, 394 FANCM, FANCF, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD2, FANCA) showed strong negative interactions with 395 camptothecin at later time points (T15, T18) only (Fig. 5d). This suggests that members of the 396 ICL pathway may recognize an ICL-like intermediate complex and serve as an alternative repair 397 pathway mechanism for double strand breaks induced by camptothecin that activates after the 398 initial HR pathway response. The intermediate time point CGI data has the ability to capture 399 time-resolution data on DNA repair pathways, potentially revealing the sequence in which 400 different DNA repair pathways respond to DNA damage. 401 402 Lagging and leading strand genes showed opposing interaction patterns due to delayed 403 replication caused by camptothecin trapping topoisomerase I on DNA strands (Fig. 5e-f). 404 POLE3 and POLE4, which displayed strong negative interactions at late time points for 405 camptothecin, encode subunits of DNA polymerase epsilon, which synthesizes the leading 406 strand during replication. In contrast, FEN1, DNA2, LIG1, MCM10, which all displayed strong 407 positive interactions with camptothecin, encode proteins that act on the lagging strand. The 408 deletion of these genes is thought to delay Okazaki fragment processing, slowing DNA 409 synthesis34. Given that camptothecin creates DNA:topoisomerase adducts, slowed DNA 410 synthesis decreases the probability that the replisome machinery will encounter these adducts, 411 which may explain the improved cell viability compared to non-treated cells. Clustering of CGI 412 scores in these curated pathways can provide evidence for distinct biological roles of protein 413 complexes or specific biological pathways. 414 415 Discussion 416 Motivated by previous efforts that established scalable CGI profiling platforms in S. cerevisiae5, 417 we developed and characterized a small, DDR-focused library for CRISPR screens. Our library 418 consists of 3,033 experimentally validated guides targeting 1,011 genes, and thus is 419 approximately 1/20th the size of typical genome-wide libraries. Screening with this library 420 requires substantially fewer reagents, both in terms of cell culture and sequencing, to maintain a 421 sufficient representation and provide quantitative measures of CGIs. The reduction of tissue 422 culture plates afforded by this scalable approach enables higher coverage (1000X 423 representation of each sgRNA), greater time point resolution of CGIs, and larger number of 424 technical replicates for added statistical power when determining significant CGIs. Based on 5 425 proof-of-principle screens, we found that it provides increased sensitivity to interactions for the 426 compressed gene space at a comparable or better SNR than genome-wide screens. 427 428 One important practical advantage to a scalable screening platform like the one we presented 429 here is the cost-efficiency of sampling interactions at multiple time points. The temporal 430 resolution of CGI data has not been previously explored and may provide novel insights into 431 how biological pathways respond to chemical perturbations over time. We found that our 432\n11\nplatform could detect the sequential action of DNA damage recognition (XRCC1/PARP1) before 433 DNA repair (POLE3/4) from the CGI profile of the camptothecin screen. In addition, we found 434 strong negative CGIs between camptothecin and Fanconi anemia complementation group 435 (FANC) genes at later time points only, suggesting a delayed dependency on the ICL repair 436 pathway in response to DNA damage induced by camptothecin. To our knowledge, this 437 potential switch from HR/SSBR to ICL response to camptothecin has not been previously 438 described. 439 440 There are notable limitations to our approach. First, given the limited gene space covered by the 441 targeted library (1,011 genes), there are many CGIs that could be informative about 442 compounds\u2019 MoA that will be missed. Indeed, we found that simply performing functional 443 enrichment analysis on the resulting hits can be substantially less informative for a small library 444 as compared to a genome-wide screen in which the entire genome is targeted (Supplementary 445\nTable 3) for some compounds (e.g. Colchicine). In our case, this library is enriched for genes 446 involved in DDR, so the platform is highly resolved for compounds with DDR-related MoA, but 447 will be less powerful for compounds targeting other functions. Future work could focus on 448 developing similar targeted libraries designed to capture other bioprocesses. A second limitation 449 of the screening platform we describe here is that, since the library design was completed, a 450 wealth of additional data from CRISPR screens has become publicly available (e.g. the DepMap 451 project has substantially expanded35). Future library design efforts should leverage all the latest 452 available screening data, which we expect would improve the extent to which the resulting 453 profiles are representative of genome-wide profiles. 454 455 In general, chemical-genetic screens provide a powerful lens for characterizing novel 456 compounds and identifying new therapeutic opportunities for drugs already in use. However, the 457 space on which CGI technology could be productively applied is enormous. There are hundreds 458 of large compound libraries, including both naturally occurring and synthetic compounds, in 459 addition to the large space of clinically approved drugs. Furthermore, exploring the functional 460 impacts of combinatorial drug treatments is also of interest. In addition to the large chemical 461 space, the cell type context in which CGI screens are conducted is also important. We focus on 462 RPE-1 and HAP1 cells here, but screening a variety of cell types, especially those well-matched 463 to specific biological or therapeutic questions, will be important. Scalable screening platforms 464 that enable rapid application of chemical-genetic screens across all these critical dimensions will 465 play an important role in realizing the full potential of this technology for drug discovery. 466 467 468 Methods 469 470 Cell lines and culture conditions 471 RPE-1 hTERT Cas9 TP53-/- (female human hTERT-immortalized retinal pigmented epithelial 472 cells) was constructed as previously described22. RPE-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s 473 Modified Eagle Medium/Nutrient Mixture F-12 (DMEM:F12) supplemented with 10% FBS and 474 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Cells were grown at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 in standard tissue culture 475 incubators. Cells were regularly tested for mycoplasma contamination with the PCR-based 476\n12\nVenora GeM Mycoplasma Detection Kit; no mycoplasma contamination was detected during 477 this study. 478 479 Targeted CRISPR library design 480\nSelection of genes for the compressed, targeted CRISPR library aimed to target the ~1,000 481 protein encoding genes that were likely to display variable cell fitness effects. Four categories 482 were chosen to select those genes: 1) 349 DNA damage response genes, 2) 100 genes 483 capturing the most variance across published CRISPR screens, 3) 216 genes that captured 484 subtle fitness defects across time-course CRISPR screen data, and 4) 463 genes that have a 485 high degree of genetic interactions. Category 2 to 4 genes were selected from genome-wide 486 data sets, but the 684 core essential genes defined in Hart et al 201718 were excluded from 487 each selection process. 488\nCategory 1 genes were manually curated and selected by DDR field experts. In contrast to 489 categories 2 to 4, genes were included regardless of their essentiality status. Category 2 genes 490 were selected by extracting CRISPR screen data from the major genome-wide cell fitness 491 readout data sets available at the time of library generation. Overall, those comprised 61 cell 492 lines36\u201340. Raw read count data were downloaded from the GenomeCRISPR database41. Gene 493 essentiality scores (Bayes Factors) for each screen were computed using the Bagel pipeline42, 494 followed by batch correction using the combat method implemented in the sva Bioconductor 495 package in R43 (Surrogate Variable Analysis. R package version 3.48.0). The top 100 genes 496 with the greatest average variance across batch-corrected fitness scores were selected to 497 constitute category 2 genes. Category 3 genes were selected by using time-course genome-498 wide CRISPR screen data from HAP1 cells. To obtain robust temporal sgRNA dropout patterns, 499 the data of seven HAP1 TKOv3 library screens, of which three had intermediate time points that 500 were taken every three days up to the endpoint measurement (T18)44, were merged. The 501 consensus log2 fold-change (T[3 \u2013 18] / T0) was computed for each sgRNA at each time point. 502 To classify genes by their dropout pattern, we defined distinct short time-series expression 503 miner (STEM) clusters for all ~71k sgRNAs that captured subtle fitness defect changes over the 504 length of the screen. Overall, we defined 12 distinct clusters. To assign a gene to a cluster, we 505 then only kept genes where two (of the four) independent sgRNAs were clustered and no other 506 cluster contained more than a single sgRNA targeting that gene. We then selected even 507 numbers of genes from each cluster for the compressed library. Category 4 genes were 508 selected from an unpublished genome-wide genetic interaction data set measured in HAP1 509 cells. Specifically, genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens had been performed with the TKOv3 510 library in HAP1 wildtype (control) and HAP1 knockout cells in which a specific knockout was 511 introduced. Overall, 33 genetic backgrounds were screened at the time of the library design. 512 Quantitative GI (qGI) scores were extracted from those 33 screens45, and the 463 most frequent 513 interacting genes at a qGI-associated FDR of 10% were chosen. 514\nOverall, 1,011 total genes were selected for the targeted library, with several genes overlapping 515 multiple categories (see Supplementary Table 5 for complete list). For 990 genes, we selected 516 the 3 best performing guides from the genome-wide TKOv3 library. Those were defined based 517 on a comprehensive set of screens performed in 33 distinct genetic backgrounds in HAP1 cells. 518\n13\nSpecifically, we quantified genetic interactions between each gene in the TKOv3 library with the 519 defined background mutation present in a given HAP1 clone. To measure sgRNA quality, we 520 utilized the sgRNA genetic interaction scores by computing the pairwise Pearson correlation 521 coefficients (PCC) between all sgRNA targeting the same gene across their genetic interaction 522 profiles. Per sgRNA, the PCCs were summed up and the sgRNA with the three highest scores 523 were chosen. The remaining 21 genes were not found in the TKOv3 library and were manually 524 chosen for the targeted library. In total, there are 3,033 sgRNAs targeting 1,011 genes in the 525 targeted CRISPR library. 526\nThis custom, DDR-focused targeted library was constructed by Cellecta, with each sgRNA 527 cloned into the pRSG16-U6-sg-HTS6C-UBiC-TagRFP-2A-Puro plasmid. The plasmid contains a 528 puromycin-resistance cassette for selection of cells that contain a library sgRNA during the 529 pooled screen. 530\n531 Proof-of-principle scalable CRISPR-Cas9 chemical screens 532 A detailed protocol of the scalable CRISPR chemical screens can be found here22. The major 533 steps are briefly described below. 534 535 Compound concentration determination 536 Compounds were all diluted in vehicle (DMSO) in preparation for screening purposes. To 537 determine the compound dosage used for each screen, we conducted an ATPase cell viability 538 assay. RPE-1 hTERT cells were initially seeded on day 1 with a density of 1,500 cells per well in 539 96-well plates. On day 2, media was removed and replaced with either media + compound in a 540 range of 10 or more doses, or with vehicle control (0.5 % w/v DMSO), in triplicates. Cells were 541 incubated for 72 hours, and on day 5, CellTiterGlo\u24c7 luminescent assay (Promega #G75752) 542 was used to approximate cell viability and generate a dose-response curve. Luminescence 543 intensities were measured on a Promega GloMax Microplate Reader. The relative survival of 544 compound-treated vs. untreated cells was expressed as a percentage of the untreated DMSO 545 control. For each compound, a dose corresponding to IC20 (20% growth inhibition relative to 546 DMSO controls) was selected for screening. Before initiating a screen, the dosage effect was 547 verified in the 15-cm tissue culture plates that would be used for the screen. 548 549 Lentivirus production and infection 550 Cells in 15-cm dishes at 70% confluency were transfected with 1.9x109 TU/mL of lenti-library 551 and 10 ug/mL polybrene, yielding a MOI of 0.2 (1 in 5 cells infected). A separate 15-cm control 552 plate of cells was cultured in parallel. 24 hr after transfection, the medium was replaced with 553 fresh medium containing 3 ug/mL puromycin to transduced plates and to the control plate. 48h 554 after puromycin treatment, cells completely died in the control plate. The remaining cells in the 555 transduced plates, which have all presumably integrated a sgRNA, are pooled and pelleted. 556 557 Pooled screen 558 At T0, cells were split into media with vehicle control (DMSO) or with one of the 5 compounds at 559 an IC20 dosage, seeding ~ 3x10 6 cells per replicate (1 15 cm plate per replicate) at a desired 560\n14\n1,000-fold sgRNA coverage. Additionally, cell pellets were collected at T0. Cells were split every 561 3 days into a combination of new medium and compound or DMSO, ensuring 1,000-fold sgRNA 562 coverage at each split. Cell pellets were also collected every 3 days until T18 (T3, T6, T9, T12, 563 T15, T18). Technical replicates were independent throughout the screen (cells were not pooled 564 together after each passage). 565 566 NGS library prep 567 Genomic DNA was extracted from each cell pellet using the Promega Wizard Genomic DNA 568 Purification Kit (Promega #A1120), following standard protocol. Next, two-round PCR was 569 performed using the Cellecta NGS prep kit for sgRNA barcode libraries in pRSG16/17 570 (KOHGW) (Cellecta # LNGS-120) and the Supplementary Primer Sets (Cellecta #LNGS-120-571 SP) to amplify the sgRNA and append Illumina sequencing adapters and index barcodes for 572 each replicate sample. We used 20 ug of genomic DNA in 50 uL 1st-round PCR reaction 573 volume, and 5 uL of PCR1 product for 50 uL 2nd-round PCR reaction volume. QIAquick PCR 574 Purification (Qiagen #28104) and Gel Extraction Kits (Qiagen #28704) were used to clean up 575 the library prep, and samples were run on a 2% agarose-1X TAE gel to check product size 576 before next-generation sequencing. A maximum of 48 samples were pooled and sequenced on 577 a single lane on the Illumina NextSeq 550 (standard Single-Read 150-cycles) at the UMGC 578 (University of Minnesota Genomics Center) using common sequencing primers provided by 579 UMGC and indexing primers provided by Cellecta. 580 581 Genome-wide screens 582 Genome-wide screens were conducted in a similar fashion to screens described here45. These 583 screens utilized the Toronto KnockOut version 3 (TKOv3) genome-wide library18 in the near-584 haploid HAP1 cell line. Each compound was screened at an IC50 concentration, and library 585 representation was maintained at ~250-fold coverage. Cell pellets were collected and 586 sequenced at T0 and T18 for all compounds (except T13 for olaparib). 587 588 CRISPR genome-wide screen data was not available for bortezomib. Instead, CGI hits were 589 derived from a bortezomib shRNA screen46. The shRNA library used for this screen targeted 590 7,712 genes involved in proteostasis, cancer, apoptosis, kinases, phosphatases, and drug 591 targets46. This screen data was used for comparison vs. the scalable bortezomib screen. 592\nRaw read counts 593\nDemultiplexed FASTQ files were generated using the Illumina bcl2fastq software. These files 594 were used as input for the Cellecta \u201cNGS Demultiplexing and Alignment Software,\u201d along with a 595 \u201cSample Description File\u201d that matched index barcode to each sample and a \u201cLibrary 596 Configuration File\u201d containing a list of target sgRNA guide sequences. The Cellecta software 597 generated a table of raw read counts for each sgRNA (row) and each sample (column). 598\nChemical-genetic interaction scoring 599\nCGIs were scored using an adapted version of the Orthrus software23. Raw read counts were 600 normalized by read depth for each sample. Per-guide-level log2 fold changes (LFC) were 601\n15\ncalculated between an intermediate or end time point and starting time point (T0). LFC values 602 underwent two additional normalization steps: 1) MA-transformation, where guide-level ratios 603 (M) were plotted against mean average (A) guide-level LFC data, and 2) loess (locally 604 estimated scatterplot smoothing) regression, which bins the data with equal bin sizes along the 605 A values and fits a smooth curve through the data points within each bin. Replicate normalized 606 LFC values are averaged before downstream steps. Then, the guide-level CGI scores were 607 derived from calculating the differential normalized LFC values between compound and control 608 screens. Guide-level CGI scores per gene were averaged and tested for significance using the 609 moderated t-test from the limma R package24. P-values were adjusted through Benjamini-610 Hochberg multiple testing correction per screen. The code for CGI scoring is available at this 611 link. 612\nThe CGI scoring approach described above was used to derive CGI hits from raw read count 613 screen data for the scalable screens, for the genome-wide screens performed by us, and for the 614 genome-wide screens performed by Olivieri et al. 615\nScreen quality control metrics 616\nTo assess the quality of the resulting CRISPR screen data, we used three quality control 617 metrics: 1) replicate correlation on LFC and CGI scores, 2) core essential gene dropout, and 3) 618 within-vs-between context correlation (WBC) scores. Replicate correlation was computed with a 619 Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient on the vector of LFC values between all possible replicate pairs 620 (AB, AC, BC). Using a core essential gene standard defined by the Broad Dependency Map 621 (DepMap35) data (genes observed to be broadly essential across many cell lines, see Essential 622 genes analysis), we generated AUC-ROC (area under the curve \u2013 receiver operating 623 characteristic) values to quantify how well core essential genes drop out relative to non-624 essential genes throughout the length of the screen. WBC scores were calculated as previously 625 described25. 626\nVisualization of clustering analyses 627 The heatmap for Fig. 2a was generated using a Pearson correlation coefficient similarity metric 628 and average-linkage, hierarchical clustering and visualized in Java TreeView version 1.2.0. The 629 heatmaps for Fig. 4 were generated using Pearson correlation coefficient similarity and 630 average-linkage, hierarchical clustering options from the pheatmap R package. 631 632 Library hit rate 633 Library hit rate is defined as the ratio of the number of significant hits to the library size (in 634 number of genes). To compare library hit rates from scalable vs. genome-wide screens, we 635 subset the 1,011 targeted library genes from the genome-wide screen library and applied 636 multiple hypothesis correction only on this subset to avoid penalizing the genome-wide screen 637 data for additional tests beyond the 1,011 genes. Next, we tallied the number of total CGIs, 638 positive CGIs, and negative CGIs for each screen, using a CGI score cutoff of greater than 0.7 639 (for positive CGIs) or less than -0.7 (for negative CGIs) and a false discovery rate (FDR) lower 640 than 10% (Supplementary Table 1). We then calculated the library hit rate for each time point 641\n16\nscalable screen vs. genome-wide screen (Fig. 3a). We also took the union of unique gene hits 642 across all time points for the scalable screens to simplify comparisons to genome-wide screens. 643 644 Signal-to-noise ratio 645 For each screen, each of the 1,011 genes in the targeted sgRNA library is associated with a 646 CGI score and FDR value. A \u201csignificant hit\u201d is defined by a CGI cutoff (|CGI| > 0.7) and FDR 647 cutoff (FDR < 0.1). Genes are divided into 3 categories: 1) \u201cgold standard\u201d hits, defined by 648 intersecting the hits from a scalable time point screen with genome-wide screen hits, 2) the 649 \u201cbackground noise\u201d set, defined as genes with CGI values in the middle 80% of the distribution 650 of CGI values (10th-90th percentile, expected to reflect random variation across non-interacting 651 genes), and 3) all other genes. We defined the signal-to-noise ratio as follows: 652 653\n654 where \u03bc is the average CGI score across all gold standard genes, and \u03c3 is the standard 655 deviation of the CGI scores of genes in the background noise set. SNRs were calculated 656 individually for each time point of a given compound screen. 657 658 Mode-of-action fold enrichment analysis 659 To quantify to what extent the known mode-of-action (MoA) of a compound is enriched in its 660 CGI profile, we perform the following analysis. First, we select a Gene Ontology: Biological 661 Process (GO:BP) term that best describes the biological process or pathway perturbed by the 662 compound in question. This GO:BP term must have the gene encoding the protein target of the 663 compound annotated to it. Second, we define the fold enrichment (FE) metric for each time 664 point screen with the following equation: 665 666\n/\n/\n667 where n is the number of hits found in the GO:BP term ascribed to the MoA, M is the number of 668 significant hits for that time point of the screen, k is the number of library genes found to be 669 annotated to the GO:BP MoA term, and N is the total number of library genes. The same 670 equation can be used to describe the global fold enrichment across all screens, where n is the 671 number of compound-hit pairs found in the MoA GO:BP for each compound, M is the number of 672 compound-hit pairs detected, k is the number of compound-library gene pairs found to be 673 annotated to the GO:BP MoA term, and N is the total number of compound-library gene pairs. 674 The global fold enrichment metric can further be broken down by considering essential and non-675 essential genes separately (see \u201cEssential gene analysis\u201d section), or negative or positive CGIs 676 only. Each FE metric is reported in log2 transformation and associated with a p-value calculated 677 from a hypergeometric test. 678 679 Essential gene analysis 680\n17\nAn essential gene standard is defined from the CRISPR screen Broad Dependency Map 681 (DepMap35) 20Q2 dataset. A gene is defined as essential if it exhibits a < -1 CERES score in > 682 60% of the 769 DepMap cancer cell lines35. The targeted library contains 55 essential genes, 683 and this essential gene set was used to generate AUC-ROC curves to assess screen quality. 684 685 For the essential gene mode-of-action analysis, we derived the following approach to determine 686 if a CGI was supported by single or multiple sgRNAs: 1) for each gene, calculate residuals to 687 average DMSO LFC at each time point for each of the 3 sgRNAs, 2) calculate the standard 688 deviation of these residuals, 3) calculate an uncorrected differential score matrix between 689 compound and DMSO LFC, 4) determine if each differential score exceeds one standard 690 deviation threshold in at least two or more time points of a screen, and 5) determine whether the 691 differential score is supported by 1 or multiple of the 3 targeting sgRNAs per gene. 692 693 Pathway enrichment analysis 694\nFor GO:BP enrichment analysis, we used the \u201cenrichGO\u201d function in the clusterprofiler R 695 package. Parameters include a p-value cutoff at 0.05, a q-value cutoff at 0.2, minimum gene set 696 size at 5, and maximum gene set size at 200. P-values were adjusted by the Benjamini-697 Hochberg method. 698\nFor the targeted library only enrichment analysis, a set of 11 DNA repair and replication 699 pathways were manually curated for the targeted library genes (see Supplementary Table 6). 700 Assuming a normal distribution for the CGI scores, a z-score was calculated using the following 701 formula for each pathway: 702\n\u0304\n/ \u221a\nwhere x = average CGI score of all genes annotated to the pathway, \u03bc = the average CGI 703 score across all library genes, \u03c3 = the standard deviation of CGI scores across all library genes, 704 and n = number of genes annotated to the pathway. A two-tailed p-value is calculated for each 705 z-score using the pnorm function in R. The p-values are then adjusted for multiple comparisons 706 using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. 707\n708\n709\n710\n711\n712\n713\n18\nFigure Legends 714 715\nFig. 1 Scalable CRISPR-Cas9 chemical screen platform. a The categories of genes selected 716 for the targeted sgRNA library.
