            "text": "Australia recorded its first case of COVID-19 in late January 2020 with community transmission occurring soon after [1]. In response, the Australian government rapidly implemented several risk reduction measures including travel restrictions, wearing of masks, imposing density limits in public and private spaces and periodic community lockdown measures [1]. Many non-essential health services were closed or where possible, delivered online. Despite being an essential service, maternity and newborn care was significantly disrupted by these changes. Face-to-face antenatal care was replaced by telehealth in many jurisdictions, antenatal education classes were cancelled or moved online, and limits on the number of support people who could attend ultrasound scans, labour, birth and the postnatal ward were introduced [2\u20134].\nWhilst pregnant women are not more likely to contract COVID-19 compared to non-preg-\nnant women, if they do so they are at higher risk of death or developing severe disease from SARS-CoV-2 infection, including higher rates of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and invasive ventilation when compared to non-pregnant women [5]. Globally, increasing maternal mortality rates have been seen in location such as Brazil and Mexico as a result of the pandemic [6, 7]. In addition, babies of women with COVID-19 infection during pregnancy have higher rates of preterm birth and admission to neonatal ICU [5, 8]. As SARS-CoV-2 spread rapidly worldwide, health systems were in a constant state of flux\u2013reacting, adapting and mitigating in response to the novel coronavirus [9]. Clear, timely and targeted information was essential to support pregnant women in making healthcare-related decisions during an uncertain and rapidly evolving time. Social media represented an ideal platform to spread information quickly and has been used to rapidly disseminate information during previous public health emergencies and disease outbreaks, including Ebola, H1N1 (swine flu) and MERS-CoV outbreaks [10\u201313]. In addition, social media analytics have been used to better understand public perceptions and responses to emerging infectious diseases [14].\nWhilst pregnant women using social media to access information about pregnancy, birth\nand caring for their baby is not a new phenomenon [15\u201318] the novel nature of the pathogen in the setting of a global pandemic created the perfect storm for an \u2018infodemic\u2019 [17]. This infodemic led to an abundance of false and misleading information on digital platforms, creating barriers to women\u2019s access of accurate information [17]. Several studies have documented shortcomings in health communication related to pregnancy and childbirth during the pandemic, leaving many women and families feeling anxious and isolated [3, 4, 19\u201322].\nAustralia was one of the few countries globally that was able to bring community transmis-\nsion of COVID-19 to zero in 2020 [23] and its second largest city, Melbourne, was renowned for being the most \u2018locked down\u2019 city in the world [24]. As such, Australia is a unique setting\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0279990 January 13, 2023 2 / 16\nIntegrity Officer (admin@burnet.edu.au).

Phases occurred concurrently from June to July 2021. Prior to June 2021, levels of COVID-19 community transmission in Australia had been relatively low compared to international settings, however shortly after Australia\u2019s two most populous cities, Melbourne and Sydney, both experienced significant surges of community transmission and spent extended periods in lockdown.

The data analytics tool TIGER-C19 (Timely Integration of user-\nGEnerated Responses to C19) (Fig 1) was used to extract publicly available posts containing selected key terms from two social media platforms\u2013Reddit and Twitter. Both platforms allow users to create posts and discussion in a publicly available forum. Reddit consists of multiple online communities or \u2018subreddits\u2019 specific to a topic of interest [25]. Two popular methods of sharing or liking posts on these platforms include retweeting (Twitter) and upvoting (Reddit). Retweeting involves the sharing of a Twitter post by another user, upvoting (Reddit) allows users to \u2018like\u2019 others posts/threads and can indicate the level of approval of the post from other users. Use of Reddit in Australia is increasing, and Australian users comprise of the platforms fourth largest user base [26]. Extracted posts from Reddit came from two Australian subreddits related to COVID-19 and pregnancy. Posts from Twitter and Reddit were eligible for data collection from June to July 2021 if they met the inclusion criteria: written in English and relevant to the research phenomenon. Posts were excluded if they contained no expression of personal opinion or comment (for example re-tweeting a news article with no added text), the meaning of the post was indiscernible or if they were not related to the Australian context. This was filtered by both the TIGER-C19 data analytics tool and the researcher when reviewing collected posts. Details of TIGER-C19 methodologies have been documented previously [27]. Data collection complied with the terms and conditions of social media platforms Reddit and Twitter.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0279990.g001\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0279990 January 13, 2023 3 / 16\nData collection. Weekly data collection occurred using the TIGER-C19 tool over eight\nweeks from June to July 2021. Each week selected search terms aimed to extract posts that gave insights into the community attitudes and understanding of COVID-19 in pregnancy in Australia. Search terms evolved and changed as results were reviewed each week. Search terms that did not yield large numbers of results were modified and new key terms identified, these changes were also made in response to the evolving COVID-19 situation in Australia and changing socio-political context. For example, when policy changes recommending vaccination for pregnant women came into effect, key terms were adjusted to include vaccines and vaccination, see Fig 2. Key search terms used included: pregnancy, pregnant, COVID baby, miscarriage, infertility, vaccine, vaccination, antenatal, birth and breastfeeding. To ensure results were relevant to the research topic, these key terms were often searched for in conjunction with COVID specific terms, such as \u2018vaccine + miscarriage\u2019, or \u2018pregnancy + vaccine\u2019.\nData analysis. Inductive content analysis was used to interpret the social media data [28]. Inductive content analysis allowed for social media data to be considered broadly and for conceptualisations to be made without pre-set categories. Data were analysed for common patterns as they relate to pregnancy and COVID-19. The 220 most re-tweeted (Twitter), and upvoted (Reddit) posts that met the pre-specified inclusion criteria were included in the analysis. These posts were initially read and assigned a code using an Excel spreadsheet and Word document. One post could be assigned to multiple codes. Codes were then grouped into broader categories which became the coding framework for subsequent coding. This was an iterative process, with codes and categories being reviewed and refined as needed. Analysis occurred with the wider research team through regular meetings to discuss coding frameworks and resolve discrepancies in interpretation."

Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted by an experienced\nqualitative researcher using a semi-structured interview guide via the video platform \u2018Zoom\u2019 or by telephone, as preferred by participants. Lasting between 30\u201360 minutes, interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Verbal consent was obtained and demographic information collected. The primary researcher (CC) conducted all interviews. Interviews discussed the information participants had received regarding impacts of COVID-19 on pregnancy, where information was sought, the use of social media in obtaining and sharing information and how information received shaped experiences and decision-making. The semi-structured nature of interviews allowed participants to place emphasis on experiences most important to them. This provided important insights into current public perceptions about pregnancy and COVID-19 and informed search terms used in the social media analysis. We stopped recruitment after we achieved information power [29], minimal new data were being generated and we had sufficient data to answer the research question.\nData analysis. Thematic analysis was used to analyse interview data [30]. Thematic analy-\nsis is suited to analysing transcribed interviews, where detailed and lengthy data can be coded to generate patterned meanings [30]. Coding and interview data were managed using NVIVO software [31]. Analysis began by reading through all transcripts to become familiar with the data set. Two researchers (CC, AW) individually coded a sub-sample of transcripts and codes were contrasted and compared for consistency. Coding discrepancies were resolved through discussion and collaboratively reviewing the data with the wider research team. The remaining transcripts were coded by the primary researcher (CC). This was an iterative process with codes being refined and developed. Codes were then grouped to create initial themes and subthemes and the data set was re-read to ensure the data depth was reflected. The analysis process occurred in conjunction with the wider research team through weekly meetings and discussions, improving the richness of interpretations."

Some described how this information influenced their decision to adopt personal precautions and where to accept health care. \u201cI think all my information about COVID, and pregnancy probably came through her [my obstetrician] . . .she talked a lot about how I could manage being pregnant in this situation and keeping safe.\u201d (Postnatal mother, second baby.) Providing COVID-19 information to women empowered them with an increased sense of control and the ability to adopt risk reduction strategies.\nSearching for knowledge. Risks to themselves, their pregnancy and the baby. Participants actively sought information regarding the potential impacts and associated risks of COVID-19 on their pregnancy and/or newborn. Many participants wanted to know common signs and symptoms of COVID-19 infection in pregnancy and/or newborns and described difficulty finding this information: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fear.What happens if I do get COVID? Is that gonna affect my pregnancy? . . . how\u2019s that gonna affect the baby potentially?\u201d (Postnatal mother, second baby). Rapid changes to maternity care impacted on women\u2019s ability to access routine antenatal information: \u201cSo there was no access to birthing classes, any of that sort of stuff. . .we were just winging it basically.\u201d (Postnatal mother, first baby). This extended into the postnatal period with many women reporting not receiving child maternal health visits during periods of lockdown and having difficulty sourcing important information about newborn care. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the normal maternal and child health visits, how do you care for a newborn. . . what do you do when your child has a fever and you\u2019re in lockdown. . . I just wanted her [child] to see a GP but she couldn\u2019t until you\u2019ve had a COVID test. . . and back then they were taking four to five days, what\u2019s happened to your freaking baby in the meantime?\u201d. (Postnatal mother, second baby).\nParticipants also described receiving limited information about the COVID-19 vaccine and\ncited this as a major gap in information provided to them. Many were uncertain whether it was safe or recommended in pregnancy. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t actually been any proactive messaging to me about COVID-19, especially regarding the vaccines there\u2019s been nothing mentioned to me or discussed with me or with any of the health providers, if that would affect me, or even if I would be able to get the vaccine.\u201d (Pregnant woman, first pregnancy). Public health recommendations and advice changed over the course of the interview period and often these updates were slow to reach women in the community, with many participants being unaware of changes to vaccine recommendations.\nPractical implications. There was a need for better communication on the impacts of changes to maternity care. This was a consistent theme from women in settings of both higher and lower levels of COVID-19 community transmission. Restrictions often meant limited contact with health services where women would give birth and this presented a unique gap in women\u2019s knowledge of the hospital they would receive care in. Women wanted practical information, for example, tours of maternity and birthing suites, videos and maps displaying the best place to park the car and enter the building and how to get to the maternity ward:\u201cI was even hoping if just a midwife with a phone went around and did like a video, labour room, birthing area, like [a] tour just to give us an idea, because I literally have no idea how to even get into the hospital to find the birthing ward, what did the rooms look like? . . .we had nothing, it was very daunting.\u201d (Postnatal mother, first baby).\nMany women were confused or unaware of the impact of hospital restrictions on labour\nand birth. They received inconsistent information from staff members and reported confusion as to what constituted a \u2018support person\u2019 or \u2018carer\u2019. Restrictions regarding support people were particularly unclear for non-heteronormative family units: \u201cNo that [hospital restrictions] was\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0279990 January 13, 2023 8 / 16\ncommunicated terribly. . . or it just wasn\u2019t communicated at all. before I went in to have the baby I asked about the restrictions, and the nurse on maternity just didn\u2019t even know. . . because I didn\u2019t have a husband coming in you know, so what does [my] mum count as and can she bring back my son and they just were clueless.\u201d (Postnatal mother, birth to twins) Clarity of this information was especially important for participants with complex pregnancies or with previous experiences of miscarriage who spoke of the importance of knowing their support person would be allowed to attend appointments. The impact of being COVID-19 positive on the level of care birthing women required or being separated from their newborn was also of concern, this was especially relevant for those from regional locations or smaller states where local hospitals may not be able to provide appropriate care to a pregnant woman who was COVID19 positive. \u201cI googled the s\u2014t out of, you know, what would happen if I got COVID-19 while I was pregnant.What would happen if I ended up having it [COVID-19] while I was going in to give birth . . . would they take her away if I was diagnosed positive.\u201d (Postnatal woman, third baby).\nTurning to informal sources. When desired information was insufficient, inaccessible, or unavailable, women turned to informal sources such as internet searches, social media, friends and family. Although many wanted information from reputable sources, barriers limited their ability to attain this information. This included difficulty navigating government websites and fear information available would be outdated: \u201cI would pass New South Wales Health [department]. . .I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve been very good actually at presenting like digestible information\u201d (Pregnant woman, second pregnancy).\nAll participants used some form of social media. The most cited platforms were Facebook and Instagram, although participants also referred to Reddit, TikTok, Snapchat and Twitter. Women described using social media as an additional source of information when information was otherwise limited: \u201cthe information in the public domain wasn\u2019t really that much. . .I guess that\u2019s what Facebook kind of gave me is that broader social network to ask questions or to at least have information that wasn\u2019t in the general publications.\u201d (Postnatal mother, second baby). Social media was a useful resource for missed health information. These women followed health providers and maternity influencers on platforms such as Instagram. For example, one woman said: \u201cWhat I did seek from missing out on antenatal classes lactation consultants and midwives that are now providing their services through Instagram, and they will post, ask me anything type of stories.\u201d (Postnatal mother, first baby). Social media algorithms also had the potential to present information to users as well as suggesting other pregnancy and birth pages to follow. In this way, social media users were passively exposed to new information. \u201cProbably not sourcing it out, it would just pop up on Facebook, because I\u2019ve obviously googled something. . . So then I would just click on something from there\u201d. (Pregnant woman, second pregnancy).\nSocial media groups such as those found on Facebook were widely used and many\ndescribed them more accurate and timely than information sought through official channels. This was especially true when information related to the impact of restrictions on health service provision: \u201csometimes because you have to call the antenatal place and you\u2019re usually on hold for like an hour, so we just check there [Facebook group] first because people answer faster.\u201d (Postnatal mother, second baby)Many noted first seeing important updates, including recommendations on COVID-19 vaccinations during pregnancy, on their social media groups. These interactions also functioned as a source of support while navigating the COVID-19 pandemic. \u201cThere was actually three of us that were pregnant all at the same time . . .if they found anything helpful, they\u2019d send me a screenshot, or we often talked about like, it\u2019s going to be okay kind of thing. . .It was hard for any family to be around us. It was hard for them to understand, they weren\u2019t pregnant in a pandemic.\u201d (Postnatal mother, first baby).\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0279990 January 13, 2023 9 / 16\nParticipants expressed concern about misinformation present within social media groups. Mis-\ninformation was often related to the safety and potential side effects of COVID-19 vaccines: \u201cpeople saying that it [vaccine] increased the risk of miscarriage and stuff. I mean, just the sorts of things you\u2019d kind of expect to be said in terms of misinformation.\u201d (Pregnant woman, first pregnancy).\nCommunicating effectively. Participants identified several ways in which communica-\ntion could be improved. This included integrating COVID-19 information into routine antenatal and postnatal care, preparing information in advance for lockdown periods and creating more opportunities for online interactions with health providers.\nNormalising and preparedness. Health providers were trusted sources of information. Many felt that just as other common illnesses such as influenza are discussed routinely in antenatal appointments, COVID-19 information and vaccination should be proactively shared and integrated into routine antenatal care: \u201cIt\u2019s about normality at this stage, whether the messaging should just address it as any other illness that could potentially impact pregnancy, like, for example, flu, you got to get your flu shots through pregnancy. . .That sort of messaging. So it\u2019s probably about normalising.\u201d (Postnatal mother, first baby). The hospital website was seen as an extension of trusted health providers and most participants highlighted that websites should be a primary source of readily available information but were often disappointed with the level of information provided.\nWomen also expected health services to prepare for the event of snap lockdowns and rapid\nchanges to the provision of maternity care and have information ready to disseminate. \u201cIt will be good for them to have things ready to hand out and send out. . . Because we can see how quick the snap lockdowns happen. . . they need to have information ready to give out to the people who are going to be giving birth.\u201d (Postnatal mother, second baby). This information should be provided through multiple communication methods both passively and actively through social media posts, updated websites and personal communication to women through an email or text.\nInteractive and in real-time. A consistent theme throughout interviews was the importance of making information more interactive when face to face care was restricted, such as during lockdowns. Participants often valued zoom sessions over information sheets and video appointments were preferred over telephone or telehealth appointments. \u201cSo I really wanted to do in person antenatal classes, to ask the questions, etc. And yeah. . .just make it like zoom meetings, the PowerPoint presentations just make it more impersonal. Plus, you just can\u2019t ask the questions that come up with as you go.\u201d (Postnatal mother, second baby).\nRegular live sessions where pregnant women could \u2018ask anything\u2019 and \u2018real time\u2019 interac-\ntions with midwives were suggested as important ways to increase interaction between health services and providers. Participants highlighted social media pages with live streams as one preferred platform and gave examples of when this had been done well. \u201cI follow the hospital on Instagram. And they\u2019re pretty good, it\u2019s sort of communicating changes very, in a very timely manner. So they will, anytime the rules changed, you know, within a couple of hours, they would have posted on Instagram saying, here\u2019s the new rule. And I think that was quite good.\u201d (Postnatal mother, second baby) Participants described following trusted sources on social media and wanting regular communication, even if no new updates were warranted. \u201cI just feel like, tell us what\u2019s going on, let us know that you\u2019re dealing with it, or let us know what is that it\u2019s being investigated or whatever, but don\u2019t pretend it\u2019s not happening.\u201d (Postnatal mother, second baby) If there was uncertainty, women wanted this acknowledged and some indication that this information would be made available once decisions had been made."

            "text": "Findings from this study highlight the difficulty pregnant and postnatal women had in accessing timely and clear information during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. Many women\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0279990 January 13, 2023 10 / 16\nfound the lack of information available to them to be frustrating and a source of increased anxiety, this was compounded by health related anxiety already caused by the pandemic, and this is reflected in other studies [32\u201334]. However, when information was provided it empowered women to adopt risk reduction strategies and make informed decisions about their pregnancy and birth. Social media provides an ideal platform for the rapid dissemination of targeted information and most women followed at least one trusted source on social media. However, the use of social media also has the potential to increase exposure to misinformation which can impede the management of disease outbreaks [35]. To combat this, our findings demonstrate the need for ongoing timely, interactive, and proactive health communication from government organisations and health services.\nParticipants perceived that information on COVID-19 vaccines, the impact of restrictions\non service provision and the effects of COVID-19 on pregnancy and newborns was limited and difficult to find. Indeed, difficulty finding information regarding the impacts of COVID19 on pregnancy have been documented elsewhere [34]. A recent study of pregnant women in Sweden showed many felt that they did not receive sufficient information from health care providers during the pandemic which increased feelings of stress and uncertainty [36]. In addition, an Australian cross sectional study found that only one-third of pregnant women surveyed received antenatal education, and missing this information was seen as negatively impacting on birthing experiences [33, 37]. These information gaps are significant, as information provided during maternity care has been shown to be an important factor in determining maternal satisfaction [38, 39], and insufficient COVID-19 information in this study was shown to directly contribute to negative experiences during pregnancy and birth. Even when information was available, many women found it confusing. This may in part be due to the evolving nature of COVID-19 situations however, two recent studies found that most COVID19 information provided to the Australian public exceeded recommended reading levels required to ensure widespread understanding [40, 41]. This is reflected in findings from the social media analysis which demonstrated a strong need for clearer information, especially with regards to vaccination.\nThis study also highlights the importance of familiarity with place of birth for pregnant\nwomen, people and support persons. Many women were disconnected from health services in which they would labour and birth due to public health restrictions. Women described wanting to better \u2018know\u2019 the hospital in which they would give birth, for example where to park, how to get to the maternity department and being able to see the labour ward. Not \u2018knowing\u2019 this practical information exacerbated feelings of uncertainty and a lack of control already amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of our participants were also unable to access antenatal education due to the pandemic. This is important, as having a sense of control during labour and birth, which is also facilitated by the provision of antenatal education, has been linked to increased satisfaction and a more positive birth experience [42, 43]. Although previous studies have examined the concept of a women\u2019s sense of control in pregnancy and birth, this study highlights the role familiarisation with the hospital environment has on the birthing experience, and is consistent with previous Australian studies [44, 45]. Our findings clearly suggest that understanding the schematics of the hospital setting during times of disconnect could improve women\u2019s sense of control and preparedness for birth. Where external circumstances impede on women\u2019s ability to visualise and become familiar with place of labour and birth, health services should attempt to fill this gap by finding alternate ways to support birth preparation through provision of online resources.\nSocial media has been shown to be an important source of information for pregnant\nwomen during the pandemic and most participants in our study described frequently using social media and considered it to be a preferred source of information [32, 34, 37]. Despite\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0279990 January 13, 2023 11 / 16\nthis, many health services and providers under-utilised social media to communicate information and changes. This is despite the high acceptability of social media based antenatal care services, and other studies that highlight the acceptability and preference of pregnant women to receive information in online forums [37, 46]. During periods of increased COVID-19 transmission, we found participants favoured health services that provided prompt social media updates regarding their response to changing circumstances and were critical of the lack of communication from many government bodies, health organisations and services. On the 9th June 2021 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RANZCOG) and the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) released a joint statement recommending vaccination in all stages of pregnancy for the first time in the Australian setting [47]. This statement was released during data collection and many participants interviewed after this release were unaware of these changes. This demonstrates the current limitations peak health and government bodies have in reaching the Australian community and the need to further develop communication strategies. Given the potential negative impacts of COVID-19 on newborns and those who are pregnant and the rising maternal mortality rates seen globally as a result of the pandemic [7, 48, 49] it is integral that organisations and providers facilitate the dissemination of important updates through platforms like social media, to ensure information reaches the target population."

            "text": "Online resources should be prepared and ready for use in the event of future public health measures related to COVID-19 and other potential public health crises. Health services and providers should prioritise the use of alternative, interactive information sessions\u2013for example, virtual (Zoom-based) antenatal classes and regular online \u2018ask me anything\u2019 sessions\u2014rather than pamphlets and information sheets. Where a physical disconnect between health services and pregnant women exists, practical resources about where to park and how to access maternity wards should be provided to better support women when they access unfamiliar services during labour and birth. Health providers are trusted sources of information [50] and information regarding COVID-19 and the vaccine should be routinely integrated into antenatal care. Providers should be aware that online social media groups are common sources of pregnancy information for many people and may consider participating in large social media pregnancy groups within their local areas to address misinformation and to engage with pregnant women and people in their communities.\nIt would be helpful for health services to establish and make readily available protocols outlining how varying public health measures will impact on maternity care. The presence of support persons during antenatal appointments and birth is highly valued by pregnant people [37] and protocols should include clear definitions of what constitutes a \u2018support person\u2019 and should consider family units that do not adhere to heteronormative relationships. When circumstances rapidly change, proactive statements form health services acknowledging change and their strategy to address this change could allay anxiety and uncertainty experienced by pregnant women and people during these situations [51]."
