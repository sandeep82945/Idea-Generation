1. **Investigate the fate and transport of microplastics in different environmental compartments.** This could be done by tracking the movement of microplastics through the environment using tracers or by modeling their transport using computer simulations.
2. **Assess the effects of microplastics on human health and the environment.** This could be done by conducting laboratory studies to expose organisms to microplastics and by monitoring the health of organisms in the environment that are exposed to microplastics.
3. **Develop new methods for removing microplastics from the environment.** This could be done by developing new technologies for filtering microplastics from water or by developing new materials that can absorb or degrade microplastics.
4. **Investigate the role of microplastics in the spread of disease.** This could be done by studying the attachment of pathogens to microplastics and by tracking the movement of microplastics through the environment.
5. **Develop new policies to reduce the production and release of microplastics into the environment.** This could be done by working with governments and industry to develop regulations that limit the use of microplastics in products and by promoting the use of sustainable materials.
