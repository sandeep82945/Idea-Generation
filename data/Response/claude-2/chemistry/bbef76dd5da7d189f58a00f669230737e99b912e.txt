 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming the paper:

1. Conduct a more extensive survey of antibiotic residues in bivalves from diverse geographic locations to determine the prevalence and concentrations globally. The current study had a small sample size from limited areas. 

2. Investigate the effects of different cooking methods (boiling, steaming, etc.) on antibiotic degradation and residues in bivalves. This could provide insights into food preparation strategies to minimize exposure.

3. Examine antibiotic resistance profiles of bacteria isolated from bivalves containing residues. This could shed light on if the low levels detected are sufficient to drive resistance.

4. Study the uptake and bioaccumulation of antibiotic residues in bivalves under controlled laboratory conditions to better understand kinetics and accumulation in tissues.

5. Develop rapid, cost-effective analytical methods to screen for antibiotics in bivalves for use in monitoring programs and by regulatory agencies. The current method requires specialized instrumentation not widely available.
