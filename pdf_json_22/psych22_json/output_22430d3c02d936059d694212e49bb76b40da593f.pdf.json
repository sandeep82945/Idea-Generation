    "abstractText": "The prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has risen significantly in the past two decades. Unfortunately, there is a shortage of mental health providers who have specialized training in delivering evidenced-based services to this population. Early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI) is an evidenced-based treatment recommended for toddlers with ASD, and school psychologists are uniquely positioned to help children with ASD receive it. However, many school psychologists do not receive adequate training in this subspecialty. This paper makes recommendations to school psychology training programs about how to add or improve training in this subspecialty based on the results of an Office of Special Education Programs grant-funded ASD training program which involved collaboration between a NASP-approved and APA-accredited school psychology training program and a community-based early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI) clinic. The grant supported development of an interdisciplinary didactic and clinical training program to increase the ASD knowledge, skills, and competencies of school psychology graduate students, with the broader goals of developing a replicable training model and increasing the workforce of trained providers for this underserved population. Fifteen graduate students completed the training program. Outcomes related to trainee knowledge, skills, and competencies, trainee satisfaction, and lessons learned over time analyzed within a logic model that guided the project\u2019s development and execution can be informative for other school psychology programs undertaking training in this subspecialty.",

With more than 571,000 children between the ages of 3 and 5 receiving special education services for ASD or developmental delay during the 2020\u20132021 academic year, the American public school\nsystem is faced with an unprecedented demand for professionals and resources to ensure these children receive a free and appropriate public education (U.S. Department of Education, 2022). Unfortunately, the workforce of personnel trained to identify ASD and deliver the needed early intervention services has not kept pace with the demand. Although ASD can be reliably diagnosed within the first 2\u00a0years of life and may be stable as early as 14\u00a0months of age (Pierce et\u00a0al., 2019), it is estimated that only 44% of children with ASD are diagnosed by 36\u00a0months of age (Maenner et\u00a0al., 2020). Further, diagnosed children often must wait to receive intervention services as the number of healthcare providers qualified to deliver early intervention services is far below expectations and benchmarks set by the Behavior Analyst Certification Board in 49 states (Zhang & Cummings, 2020). The overall necessity for more professionals in this field is further corroborated by Farmer et\u00a0al. (2014), who found that approximately 63% of parents of children diagnosed with ASD report unmet needs, particularly in * Therese L. Mathews tmathews@unmc.edu 1 University of\u00a0Nebraska Medical Center, College of\u00a0Nursing, Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE\u00a0985330, USA 2 Department of\u00a0Educational Psychology, University of\u00a0Nebraska\u2013 Lincoln, NE, Lincoln, USA 3 Houston, USA 4 Aurora Behavioral Group, Longwood, FL, USA 5 Children\u2019s Mercy Hospital and\u00a0Clinics, Kansas\u00a0City, MO,\nUSA 6 Boys Town National Research Hospital, Omaha, NE, USA\n1 3\nbehavioral health services. Meeting this need requires trained professionals who are both competent in the delivery of evidence-based interventions to this population and readily accessible in the community to parents and teachers.\nEarly intensive behavioral interventions (EIBI) refers to a group of evidenced-based treatments for ASD that involve a broad range of structured and naturalistic applied behavior analysis (ABA) therapeutic strategies (Foxx, 2008). Some EIBI programs follow an established curriculum (e.g., Verbal Behavior -Milestones Achievement Placement Program, Sundberg, 2008); however, a key feature of EIBI is that instruction is individualized to the child. Programs are comprehensive in that they address a range of socially significant skills across domains of development, which is reflected in the evidence supporting its effectiveness in improving language and communication skills, reducing challenging behaviors, increasing skill acquisition in activities of daily living skills, and reducing lifetime costs of treatment (e.g., Cidav et\u00a0al., 2017; PetersScheffer et\u00a0al., 2011; Yu et\u00a0al., 2020; Zwaigenbaum et\u00a0al., 2015). There is evidence that EIBI is effective for children with ASD ages 0 to 9 (National Autism Center, 2015); however, the short and long-term prognosis is greatest when services begin at the earliest age possible (Kasari et\u00a0al., 2012).\nYoung children with ASD currently access services in a variety of settings, including as part of medically necessary treatment covered by health insurance. A common model of treatment delivery for EIBI involves one-to-one services typically delivered by bachelor\u2019s-level Board Certified Assistant Behavior Analysts (BCaBA) or Registered Behavioral Technicians (RBT). Given the one-to-one nature of the treatment, the number of personnel required to deliver the needed services is daunting, leaving many toddlers and preschoolers underserved. For example, McIntyre and Zemantic (2017) found that children with autism ages birth to 3\u00a0years received ASD related services approximately 3\u00a0h a week, in contrast to the recommended 25\u00a0h per week (National Research Council, 2001).\nMost children diagnosed with ASD qualify for special educational services (SPED) as provided through the public school system and most young children with ASD receive free home-based services through their state early intervention systems under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEIA, 2004) Part C (McIntyre & Zemantic, 2017). However, the number of hours of early intervention services these systems can feasibly deliver under Part C is typically well under the recommended amount. After age 3, children with ASD may be eligible to receive SPED in a preschool setting for approximately 20\u201325\u00a0h a week under Part B of IDEIA. This is a significant increase in the amount of support that can be afforded to these children; however, many preschool educators lack\nknowledge and training in teaching children with ASD (Barned et\u00a0al., 2011; Corkum et\u00a0al., 2014).\nSchool psychologists are increasingly called upon to assist with evaluations and consultation for children with ASD in preschool settings (Albritton et\u00a0al., 2019). In fact, the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP, 2015) issued a position statement defining the role of the school psychologist in early childhood education. NASP envisions school psychologists partnering with early educators and families to provide learning experiences that will support children with communication, social skills, and academic skills for school success through the formation of collaborative relationships, assessment and evaluation, and the promotion of effective instruction and intervention. NASP sees school psychologists as having the needed expertise in identifying the child\u2019s strengths while developing research based instructional needs and providing support in evaluation to assure optimal outcomes are attained. While this may be true for a subset of school psychologists, it is likely not true for enough school psychologists to meet the need for this population at this time.\nHistorically, school psychology training programs have focused more heavily on school-age and adolescent populations compared to the early childhood population. When school psychologists do work in early education settings, the services are mostly limited to assessment and identification in meeting educational disability requirements, contributing little to the comprehensive early intervention services needed by these preschool children (Albritton et\u00a0al., 2019). In a survey of 135 practicing school psychologists, Albritton et\u00a0al. further confirmed this pattern of assessment for SPED eligibility and found that only 50% of respondents had received any training in early childhood service delivery at all, of which less than 4% reported receiving \u201ca great deal of training\u201d in this area. Remarkably, over 95% of the respondents who worked in early childhood settings reported that they received their training only through on-the job experience. Limited graduate training and a lack of professional guidance when employed in these settings were a significant concern expressed by many in the survey. They state, \u201c\u2026through responses of this study, it became apparent that many school psychologists feel that they lack the training and proper resources to provide mental health services to young children\u201d (p. 13).\nSchool psychologists\u2019 preparedness for serving students with ASD may not be much better. Harris et\u00a0al. (2020) examined school psychology trainees\u2019 knowledge and self-perceived competency in school-based services for ASD. They found that, although the trainees\u2019 knowledge about ASD grew throughout the training, the respondents expressed concern about self-perceived limitations in the areas of ASD knowledge and competencies. Interestingly, higher levels of knowledge did not necessarily predict higher\n1 3\nlevels of confidence in their abilities to provide services, suggesting that while school psychology trainees may learn about ASD as part of their training, they may lack sufficient training experiences in service delivery to feel confident. Another survey of practicing school psychologists identified gaps between best practices and current practices, with less than 25% of respondents reporting use of evidence-based assessment procedures to identify ASD (Aiello et\u00a0al., 2017). A survey of 93 school psychology training programs indicated that although a high percentage of school psychology training programs reported providing ASD-specific training within courses focused on broader topics, few provided specialized ASD course work, and opportunities for clinical experiences serving students with ASD varied across doctoral and master\u2019s-level training programs (Sansosti & Sansosti, 2013). Another survey reported that 71% of school psychologists in their programs received inadequate training in behavioral evidence-based interventions in general, let alone interventions specific to ASD (Hicks et\u00a0al., 2014).\nConsidering the increased prevalence of ASD, these reported gaps in knowledge and practitioner confidence underscore the urgent need for training that prepares school psychologists to meet the needs of children with ASD and developmental delays (Wilkinson, 2013). There are numerous resources that should inform this effort, including pre-existing training standards (e.g., Behavior Analyst Certification Board, 2012; National Association of School Psychologists, 2015) and standards on evidence-based programming for ASD (e.g., National Autism Center, 2015). Although most school psychology curriculum have adequately prepared students for diagnosis and assessment for ASD there is a gap in knowledge for evidenced based treatment (Aiello et\u00a0al., 2017). Thus, a comprehensive curriculum would include knowledge and skill development in early signs of autism, evidenced-based screening and diagnostic assessment tools, evidenced-based treatment interventions, partnering with families and teachers, and understanding research methods in ABA (Boyd & Shaw, 2010; Aeillo et\u00a0al.).\nIn addition, given that children with ASD come from various socioeconomic, cultural, ethnic, and racial backgrounds, assuring that student school psychologists are trained in understanding cultural differences and practicing in a culturally competent manner is paramount in assessing and delivering treatment strategies within EIBI programming (Mathur & Rodriguez, 2021). This is particularly important for addressing the disparities in access to services that are well-documented across diverse groups (e.g., Bilaver et\u00a0al., 2021; Sturm et\u00a0al., 2021). Further, delivering comprehensive care to children with ASD requires interprofessional collaboration and often interagency collaboration, thus educating students within a collaborative framework will model and inform this \u201creal-world\u201d delivery of care process while learning the various roles and impact of interprofessional\ncare (McClain et\u00a0al., 2021). Finally, a logic model is a key element when designing a new program, which serves as an integrative framework in which resources, activities, outputs, and outcomes are identified at the onset and serve to inform stakeholders on the process and goals and guides program evaluation. The logic model is flexible so that modifications are made with the goal of continuous improvement of the project (Cooksey et\u00a0al., 2001).\nThe aim of this paper is to describe the development and outcomes of a specialized training program for school psychology in EIBI for toddlers/preschoolers with ASD. The development and utility of a logic model, a description of the curriculum, results of student\u2019s skill development and satisfaction with the program, and lessons learned from the specialized training program will be discussed. Further, wishing to encourage the expansion of school psychologists to this underserved population, we share what we learned from coordinating training across sites, providing clinical experiences, and conducting ongoing evaluation of trainees\u2019 skills and satisfaction with the program over a period of 5\u00a0years. The logic model (see Fig.\u00a01) which was formulated at the beginning of the project helped us to connect the purpose of the project to resources, objectives, sequencing of tasks, and expected outcomes, and will be discussed in greater detail. It may serve as a useful framework for communicating the various elements of the program to other training programs."

The grant funding supported each student with a stipend and travel expenses for inter-campus commute, along with support for professional development seminars.\nTraining occurred both at the university as a part of the school psychology trainees\u2019 core curriculum and in a nonprofit, community-based EIBI clinic, the Autism Care for Toddlers (ACT) clinic, which was affiliated and staffed by personnel from the UCEDD. At the onset of the grant, the ACT clinic served approximately 10 toddlers/preschoolers with ASD per day, but after 2\u00a0years into the grant, the clinic expanded and served approximately 24 toddlers/preschoolers (age range 14 to 54\u00a0months) per day. The ACT Clinic used a\n1 3\n3-tiered delivery of care model in which RBTs delivered ABA procedures under the supervision of master\u2019s-level BCBAs. A doctoral-level BCBA directed the clinic and provided supervision to master\u2019s level BCBAs. For more information about the ACT Clinic and its development, see Mathews et\u00a0al., (2018).\nThe behavioral programming for the individual preschool/ toddlers was developed by the BCBAs with guidance of the Verbal Behavior -Milestones Achievement Placement Program (VB-MAPP; Sundberg, 2008). The VB-MAPP is an assessment tool, a curriculum guide, and skill tracking system that has been validated as an evidenced based curriculum for early learners with ASD and developmental disabilities (Barnes et\u00a0al., 2014; Gould et\u00a0al., 2011; Vietze & Lax, 2020). The curriculum is based on Skinner\u2019s analysis of verbal behaviors, developmental milestones, and tenets of the field of ABA."

The logic model presented in Fig.\u00a01 describes (a) situational factors relevant at the initiation of the program, (b) goals of the program, (c) inputs into the program provided by all parties, (d) outputs (products that resulted from project activities), and (e) short-term, intermediate, and long-term outcomes. The logic\nmodel served to frame activities as the program was organized and to help the personnel stay on course as the program developed over time. The situation clearly delineates the problem of the significant shortage of personnel trained and qualified to serve and address the needs of toddler and preschoolers with ASD, while the goals explicitly guide the framework of the need to prepare and train school psychology students in delivering early intervention services. The situation and goals remained the impetus and sustaining force which stayed on track throughout the 5-year project.\nThe inputs (what the project will invest) were essential during the planning stages of the project so the grantees could assess what resources (i.e., faculty qualified to teach, access to students, community support, complementary ongoing grants, collaborative partnerships, and relationships) could be leveraged to support success in the programming. The outputs (a direct product of the project activities) described at the onset of the grant entailed the learning activities of the school psychology trainees along with the expected number and types of patients served.\nThe outcomes reflected the change in people and systems and were measured as short term, intermediate, and long term. The short-term outcomes (i.e., 1\u20132\u00a0years) focused on the trainee skill development and the increased number of children receiving access to care. The intermediate outcomes (i.e., 3\u20135\u00a0years) reflect the knowledge imparted to the trainees who will be\n1 3\nprepared to implement and disseminate evidenced based early intervention services in schools and community clinics. The long-term outcomes (i.e., 5\u201310\u00a0years) describe the process of dissemination of this model program with the expectation that similar programs may be developed. It is the goal that more school psychology programs will incorporate similar training programs to help increase the workforce of qualified personnel and thus improve access to early intensive behavioral intervention services. Ongoing evaluation of the satisfaction and impact of the program through yearly interviews with the trainees occurred resulting in adjustment to the program. The trainee\u2019s feedback along with advisory board meetings were particularly helpful to assure trainee needs would be met."

Seven students underwent a 40-h RBT didactic training and passed the examination to become certified as RBTs. The students in the latter cohorts did not have this opportunity because of the stringent demands of maintaining delivery of clinical hours and supervision requirements as an RBT.\nAfter completion of the second year of training, students completed a 120-h externship focused on direct care with children with ASD in a setting of their choice, preferably with young children. However, because of the COVID pandemic, four of the students were unable to access these experiences for the full required amount of time, so additional clinical experiences with school-aged children (aged 6\u201312\u00a0years of age) were supplemented in community or school settings."

A project-developed 13-item self-assessment tool was completed by each student at four time-points: prior to program year 1 (pre or baseline), postyear 1, post-year 2, and at the completion of the clinical\n1 3\nexternship (referred to as post-year 3 for simplicity). This self- assessment tool was developed by the program directors and evaluated ASD knowledge topics and skill competencies which included (a) characteristics and diagnostic criteria, (b) prevalence and risk factors, (c) screening and diagnostic tools, (d) early intensive ABA evidenced-based interventions, (e) conducting a literature review, and (f) the Verbal Behavior Milestones Assessment and Placement Program (VB-MAPP). The instrument was divided into three subscales: ASD basic knowledge and skills (7 items), psychology-specific knowledge and skills (3 items), and special education-specific knowledge and skills (3 items). Students were asked to rate on a Likert scale of 1\u20135 (lowest to highest) their knowledge and practice competency for each item. Scores from this measure resulted in knowledge and competency subscales, and total knowledge scores.\nAn additional 3-item subscale measuring the student\u2019s knowledge in research and intensive early intervention programming (e.g., conducting a literature review and a small N study, and using the VB-MAPP for individualized programming) was piloted at all four time points with cohort 3 and with other students in the other three cohorts resulting in a total of 4 students at timepoint 1 (baseline), 8 students at timepoint 2 (post-year 1), 10 students at timepoint 3 (postyear 2), and 15 students at timepoint 4 (post-externship). The development of this pilot subscale resulted from the project director\u2019s realization that the 13-item instrument was missing these items which were the primary focus of program year 2; however, this realization did not occur until after the first two cohorts had completed program year 2. Thus, cohort 3 received the expanded 16-item instrument at all four timepoints; however, cohort 4 inadvertently received the original 13-item instrument at baseline.\nThe university faculty and clinical staff at the EIBI clinic evaluated the students on a 5-point scale (lowest\u2013highest)\nin respect to professionalism behaviors yearly. A 12-item checklist of expected professionalism included characteristics such as appropriate attire, grooming, confidentiality, respect for clients and staff, and promptness. Following participation in the professional development activity, students provided a narrative summary and critique of the activity attended. Faculty members scored this assignment with a rubric from 1.0 (lowest) to 4.0 (highest). The literature review, small N study, and dissemination assignments were graded by the faculty using rubrics from 1.0 (lowest) to 4.0 (highest) which measured criteria specific for each assignment (e.g., purpose of the paper, relevance to ASD, supporting evidence, measuring targeted behaviors, organization, creativity, APA formatting).\nThe quality of the weekly seminars and workshops were evaluated by the students using a 4-point Likert scale rating tool from 1.0 (lowest) to 4.0 (highest). This evaluation tool measured the presenter using criteria of presentation, organization, ability for student participation, and usefulness.\nThe students completed a 13-item survey with a 5-point Likert scale from 1.0 (lowest) to 5.0 (highest) upon completion of the program that queried their overall satisfaction with the program of their knowledge and skills learned in autism and delivery of early intervention services. In addition, annually, students completed an open-ended qualitative reflections questionnaire with six items (i.e., level of support provided in the training program, effectiveness of the program leaders, strengths and weakness of the seminars and the required projects, their comfort level in being a leader in the field, and their overall happiness with the program and recommendations for program improvement) for program years 1 and 2, and an additional item for program year 2 that queried the students on how well adjustments were made in the program based upon their recommendations.

In this training project, qualitative methods were used to gain an understanding of students\u2019 experiences with various programmatic components. This\nwas primarily conducted through an annual written reflection questionnaire (described in \u201cOutcomes Measures\u201d). The questionnaire was provided in written format to the students within approximately one month following completion of their first and second year. For two items, prompts were provided specifically to solicit both strengths and weaknesses (items 3 and 4), and item 7 included a specific prompt for suggestions for program improvements.\nA conceptual content analysis (Creswell, 2012) was used to analyze the qualitative results from the annual student reflection questionnaire in order to determine the content and the frequency with which these types of content occurred across students and across the years in which the program was implemented. An external evaluator received the written responses from the students (to maintain anonymity in\nTable 3 Descriptive statistics for program assessments\nAssessment Mean Standard deviation Range\nLiterature review 3.65 .41 3.0\u20134.0 Single-case design study 3.75 .52 3.0\u20134.0 Dissemination project 3.89 .49 3.7\u20134.0 Professional development self-reflec-\ntion yr 1 3.91 .37 3.5\u20134.0\nProfessional development self-reflection yr 2 Student professionalism yr 1 Student professionalism yr 2\n3.92 4.86 4.83 .55 .47 .47\n3.8\u20134.0 4.45\u20135.0 4.4\u20135.0\nStudent satisfaction with workshops 3.73 .39 3.0\u20134.0 Student satisfaction with overall\nprogram 4.62 .49 4.07\u20135.0\n1 3\nresponses provided). The external evaluator then provided the program instructors with two documents: a complete compilation of responses for each item (literally, using copy and paste) and an abbreviated summary of responses for each item, synthesizing the positive and negative responses. See Table\u00a05 for the quantity and types of exemplar quotes related to the five questionnaire item prompts (items 1\u20135) that sought to gain understanding of the students\u2019 experience with the program as it related to their perceptions of how the program impacted their competencies in autism in young children.\nThe criteria used for coding written comments as \u201cpositive\u201d or \u201cnegative\u201d were as follows. Positive statements were those that stated or implied that the participant liked, loved, enjoyed, helpful, satisfied, or emphasized the program or aspects of the program. This also included phrases such as \u201cgreat job with\u2026 or a huge thumb\u2019s up for\u2026\u201d Negative statements were those that stated or implied that the participant disliked, did not enjoy, a weakness, or wished some aspect(s) of the program were different. This included statements that were made about redundancy in training (e.g., a content component that was already included as part of another course in their training program). Comments were coded as \u201cneutral\u201d if they did not fit the criteria to be coded as \u201cpositive\u201d or \u201cnegative.\u201d This included comments that simply stated that the participant participated in a training seminar. However, it is worth noting that there were very few/no neutral comments identified.\nThe process used for coding participant comments as positive, negative, and neutral follows. First, the project co-evaluator read through the comments and assigned a code of positive, negative, or neutral. Then, the project evaluator engaged in the same process: read through the comments and assigned a code of positive, negative, or neutral. The project co-evaluator compared the two independent coders\u2019 assigned codes for agreement or disagreement. There was 100% agreement. Had there been any disagreements, the two coders would have discussed the disagreements and come to consensus. If consensus would not have been able to be achieved, then a third member of the project team would have coded those comments for which consensus had not been achieved, and the three coders would have discussed and come to consensus. Had there still been no consensus, then a \u201cmajority rules\u201d would have determined the final comment code.\nFor data analysis of the comments, we totaled the positive plus negative comments to derive a denominator. Then, we calculated the percentage of positive comments by dividing the positive comments by the total (positive plus negative). We did the same to yield a percentage of negative comments. We did not include neutral comments in the calculation of the denominator. This was, in part, because there were so few/no neutral comments coded. Regardless\nof the occurrence or absence of neutral comments, comments coded as neutral would have been omitted from the calculation of the denominator because including them in the count could have distorted the accuracy of percentages of positives and negatives. Further, we were only interested in positive and negative comments because of their value in program improvement: positive comments informed retaining components, and negative comments prompted making improvements to the program."

Finally, the long-term outcomes of increased school psychology education in the topic areas of early intervention in the ASD population may be realized with policy change at the national and international level through professional organizations such as NASP. The high volume of children requiring services with ASD will only be met when all providers involved in their care are well trained and competent in meeting their unique needs and delivery of evidenced based services.\nOne interesting finding is that the relationship between the student satisfaction and the perceived basic autism and research related competencies was not robust. There are several possible explanations for this, but most likely the sample size of 15 may not yield sufficient power to draw conclusions for this correlation. Additionally, the satisfaction with the training program may not be a strong predictor of perceived competency. Although all students increased in knowledge and skill acquisition, the content and experiences delivered may not have been sufficient for students to have achieved the confidence to meet mastery level, particularly for those students who had previous limited experience with children with ASD and delivery of early intervention services. Finally, for those students who were trained in the 4th cohort, the completion of the small N study and \u201cin person\u201d clinical experiences were reduced because of the COVID pandemic possibly leading to a decreased perceived competency.\nThe specialization track described may serve as a model for other school psychology training programs or subgroups of a cohort interested in specializing in delivering services for the population of young children with ASD. Below are recommendations based on lessons learned through the development and implementation of this program."

There must be a compatibility between the university program\u2019s training model and the training site\u2019s service-delivery model. This compatibility and the reasonable proximity of the two programs were important factors that brought the collaborators together. The school psychology students were receiving training in applied behavior analysis, consultation, assessment, and single-case experimental design methodology as a part of their core curriculum, which fit well with the ABA services delivered in the clinic. Given the strong evidence supporting ABA services to the ASD population and the increasing prevalence of ABA services,\nschool psychology programs providing training in this area may find ready collaborators. ABA training may help school psychology students obtain some of the necessary practicum experiences necessary to qualify for the BCBA credential. Obtaining the BCBA credential can help school psychologists develop a specialization in the field and even find jobs. A Burning Glass Technologies (2015) report commissioned by the Behavior Analysis Certification Board found an increase in job postings from 146 to 425 for clinical, counseling, and school psychologists demanding behavior analyst skills. It also found that in lists of jobs requiring behavior analyst credentials between 2012 and 2014, the title of \u201cschool psychologist\u201d was consistently in the top ten job titles (third in 2012, ninth in 2013, and fourth in 2014). But for school psychology trainees to benefit from this, a mutual commitment to a training model like this must be made. This commitment is at the core of collaboration and helps all parties to work through challenges and difficulties when they inevitably arise.\nClose collaboration must also continue on an ongoing basis to effectively coordinate training across sites, evaluate outcomes, and make necessary adjustments over time. Strong collaboration helps to assure continuity of the program over time when personnel changes, problems, and crises like a worldwide pandemic occur (Ortiz & Levine, 2021)."

            "text": "Logic models provide a simple visual representation of how a program or organization works to accomplish its goals while specifying intended outcomes. This tool provides accountability and allows programs to communicate how they are functioning and how well they are doing (W.W. Kellogg Foundation, 2004). Kekahio et\u00a0al. (2014) provide a helpful description of the utility of logic models when they state, \u201cDeveloping a logic model at the beginning of program planning gives you a framework for charting the links between your program\u2019s resources, activities, and outputs and its intended outcomes. It enables you to evaluate your program once it begins. And it helps you communicate to your stakeholders what you want to accomplish, how you intend to reach your goals, and how you will track your progress\u201d (p. 1). Expanding a professional psychology program\u2019s training opportunity is a large undertaking and requires careful planning, including a vision for the purpose of the program, conceptualizing its interconnected features, coordination between different elements of the program, and a conceptualization of the potential impact of the program.\nThe logic model served to frame activities as the program was organized and to help the personnel to stay on course as the program developed over time. Although logic models generally contain the same basic elements, the names for\n1 3\nthose elements and their visual representation can vary from model to model, which gives programs flexibility in how they portray their project. The most important thing is the planning that goes into taking a general idea for a project and conceptualizing how all the pieces will be fit together as a coherent picture. As a partnership is being formed across sites, trainers should propose to collaboratively develop a logic model with their colleagues at the training site (see Kekahio et\u00a0al., 2014 &W.W. Kellogg Foundation, 2004). This activity will frame the project for both parties and allow them to communicate to their constituents who may wonder whether the program adds value to the existing services. It will also help both parties evaluate whether the program is having its intended impact or whether it needs to be revised or terminated."

In the current program, the core curriculum included courses in ABA, school-based consultation, academic and behavioral assessment, professional ethics, developmental psychopathology, single-case experimental designs, school mental health and behavioral interventions, and a school-based practicum, all of which met the requirements for both NASP and APA accreditation.

They completed a single-case experimental design study during their 2nd year concurrently with a universitybased class on single-case experimental designs. The faculty guided the students in development of the research project, supervision during data collection, and dissemination of the results. Examples of study topics were \u201cUsing Natural Environment Teaching (NET) to Improve the Generalization of Peer Directed Mands\u201d and \u201cIncreasing Functional Play in the Presence of High Level Restricted and Repetitive Behaviors.\u201d\nActive learning involves didactic and supplemental assignments which augments students' training by providing greater depth and breadth to areas to which they have not been previously exposed, which has potential to increase their skills and expand the professional settings in which they are qualified to work (Fayombo & Campus, 2014). This\ntoo is an area in which collaboration can be beneficial to the students. Program faculty may already be aware of areas where program training can be strengthened, and clinic personnel can identify areas of needed training based on their observations of the trainees in the clinic setting from a more impartial point of view. The clinic personnel may be able to deliver some of the training, as was the case in this project, or identify qualified individuals to provide such training."

The NASP and APA organizations both encourage and require ongoing competency assessment of students as a part of their accreditation requirements. Continuous, systematic evaluation of students at the clinic site can provide supplemental information about individual students\u2019 growth along with data for formative evaluation of the program. An advantage of this approach is that assessments can be conducted by professionals outside of the program, bringing a much-needed external perspective on students\u2019 progress toward independence. In our program, we developed and used assessments such as the professionalism evaluation form and self-assessment form which are similar to rating scales or checklists used by training programs (e.g., practicum supervisor evaluation forms, clinic supervisor evaluation forms, and internship supervisor evaluation forms).\nAccredited programs may adopt similar assessments to the ones used in this program, use other available assessments (e.g., Price et\u00a0al., 2017), or they may already have assessments of their own which can be adapted. It is\n1 3\nimportant, however, for programs to collaborate with clinic professionals to refine them to (a) match the objectives of the site and (b) reflect priorities that clinic professionals may have in terms of professional skills, behaviors, and attitudes."

We would recommend encouraging students to deliver feedback based upon their individual needs and previous experiences and adapt the programming to assure their continual skill acquisition and ability to meet their education goals.\nCompetency assessments provide programs an opportunity for self-examination and when those assessments are carried out in independent training sites, program faculty can learn things about the quality of their program. The current program\u2019s evaluation measures were developed as a part of a grant project. School psychology training programs have more extensive requirements for competency assessment. Fortunately, the APA (https:// www. apa. org/ ed/ gradu ate/ compe tency) and NASP (https:// www. naspo nline. org/) have a number of resources for doing assessments that can span both functions, student competency assessment, and program outcome reporting."

Thus, the evaluation measures were developed for the purpose of determining the outcome of increase in student knowledge and skill acquisition, and student satisfaction with the programming. Although not formally evaluated, the feasibility of collaborating with a pre-existing well established university school psychology program and a UCEDD center was attempted and successfully achieved. Another limitation was the attrition of several students. Although two students left for medical reasons, the number of total students trained was less than the expected amount. Finally, although written assignments and projects were graded by the faculty, the primary outcome measurements of knowledge and skill acquisition were based upon student perceived self-report."

            "heading": "Conclusion",
            "text": "With the increasing prevalence of young children diagnosed with ASD, the demand for qualified personnel and behavioral health work force to meet the diagnostic and\nclinical services needed for toddlers/preschoolers in the school system and community remains a daunting task. To identify early signs, diagnose in a timely manner, and assure early intervention services are delivered, clinicians from a variety of related disciplines need to join forces in identifying focused training tracks within their specialty (Gardner et\u00a0al., 2022). Although NASP (2015) calls for school psychologists to be prepared to assess and identify young children with ASD, and deliver evidenced based interventions, many school psychologists feel ill equipped and unprepared to meet this need (Harris et\u00a0al., 2020). The described specialization track provides an exemplar that is feasible to implement within a school psychology program. Although this project was funded through a Personnel Preparation grant, other programs may not have grant funding. Thus, academic leaders may find that developing a similar program may be feasible with the collaboration between institutes and clinical enterprises with a common goal of training and creating a pipeline of workforce for the clinic.\nThere were many lessons that were learned throughout the 5-year program with resulting modifications to the curriculum and clinical experiences. Some examples of modifications were suggested by the trainees which included more time in the clinic setting and assisting with writing behavioral programs. The COVID-19 crisis interrupted the final cohort\u2019s training sequence, requiring the second half of program year 2 learning experiences to be primarily via remote learning. Nonetheless, silver linings for learning opportunities arose. Most of the students completed their final year of the program observing virtually modified diagnostic evaluations, delivery of ABA interventions, and parentmanagement training interventions. In planning for similar programs in the future, developing a contingency plan for training from the outset such as embedding telehealth training and clinical experiences in the curriculum, should be considered in anticipation of unforeseen local, national, or global crises that produce short-term and prolonged interruption of training and service delivery.\nThe notable successes of this project were that all 15 students showed improvement in the knowledge, skills, and competencies in delivering evidenced based care to children with ASD. The training curriculum was conducive to active learning such that both university-based and clinic-based didactic training occurred concurrently with the applied clinical experiences provided through the community-based facility. Finally, high levels of satisfaction with the program were expressed by the trainees and faculty members. The collaboration between interprofessional and inter-agencies exemplified in this program enhanced the scope, depth, and breadth of the training experience for the graduate students and improved satisfaction of faculty members across both institutions.\n1 3\nAcknowledgements The authors would like to acknowledge the dedicated staff at the Autism Care for Toddlers clinic who worked so diligently and professionally in assisting the graduate students with the didactic and clinical training.
