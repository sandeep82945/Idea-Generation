    "abstractText": "Behavior therapy implementation relies in part on training to foster counselor skills in preparation for delivery with fidelity. Amidst Covid-19, the professional education arena witnessed a rapid shift from in-person to virtual training, yet these modalities\u2019 relative utility and expense is unknown. In the context of a cluster-randomized hybrid type 3 trial of contingency management (CM) implementation in opioid treatment programs (OTPs), a multi-cohort design presented rare opportunity to compare cost-effectiveness of virtual vs. in-person training. An initial counselor cohort (n = 26) from eight OTPs attended in-person training, and a subsequent cohort (n = 31) from ten OTPs attended virtual training. Common training elements were the facilitator, learning objectives, and educational strategies/activities. All clinicians submitted a post-training roleplay, independently scored with a validated fidelity instrument for which performances were compared against benchmarks representing initial readiness and advanced proficiency. To examine the utility and expense of in-person and virtual trainings, cohort-specific rates for benchmark attainment were computed, and per-clinician expenses were estimated. Adjusted between-cohort differences were estimated via ordinary least squares, and an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated. Readiness and proficiency benchmarks were attained at rates 12\u201314% higher among clinicians attending virtual training, for which aggregated costs indicated a $399 per-clinician savings relative to in-person training. Accordingly, the ICER identified virtual training as the dominant strategy, reflecting greater cost-effectiveness across willingness-to-pay values. Study findings document greater utility, lesser expense, and cost-effectiveness of virtual training, which may inform post-pandemic dissemination of CM and other therapies.",

            "text": "Calls to increase adoption of evidence-based practices (EBPs) by the addiction workforce date back over two decades to a seminal Institute of Medicine (1998) report. At the core of many subsequent undertakings has been design and\ndelivery of professional education activities whereby workforce members encounter, adopt, and prepare to implement EBPs. Despite such efforts to accelerate these workforce development processes, the economic toll of substance use disorders on US systems is staggering. With respect to the opioid epidemic alone, one annual estimate\u2013encompassing fatalities and demands placed on systems of healthcare and criminal justice\u2013exceeds $500 billion (CEA, 2017). Scaling up of EBPs may reduce this burden, though scrutiny is warranted for both the utility and expense of professional education activities intended to prepare workforce members to skillfully implement these practices.\nAn EBP available to the addiction workforce is contingency management (CM), which encompasses a family of behavioral reinforcement paradigms wherein client behavior is shaped toward a treatment adherence goal. Meta-analyses note a reliable range of mean effect sizes (d = 0.46\u20130.68)\n* Bryan Hartzler hartzb@uw.edu\n1 Department of\u00a0Psychiatry and\u00a0Behavioral Sciences, University of\u00a0Washington, 1107 NE 45th Street, Suite 120, Seattle, WA\u00a098105-4631, USA\n2 Research Triangle Institute International, Research\u00a0Triangle\u00a0Park, NC\u00a027709, USA\n3 Brown University Center for\u00a0Alcohol and\u00a0Addiction Studies, Providence, RI\u00a002912, USA\n4 UConn Health, Farmington, CT\u00a006030, USA\n1 3\nacross CM paradigms (Benishek et\u00a0al., 2014; Griffith et\u00a0al., 2000; Lussier et\u00a0al., 2006). One paradigm, referred to as prize-based CM (Petry et\u00a0al., 2000), rewards treatment adherence through earning of draws from an urn (or \u201cfishbowl\u201d) for prizes of varying magnitude. With workforce adoption across CM paradigms estimated at 10\u201330% (Ducharme et\u00a0al., 2010; Herbeck et\u00a0al., 2008; McGovern et\u00a0al., 2004), educational efforts merit prioritization. Such efforts for EBPs like CM have historically hinged on training, typically in a workshop format (Walters et\u00a0al., 2005). Based on convergent evidence from large-scale RCTs of EBP training methods (Miller et\u00a0al., 2004; Sholomskas et\u00a0al., 2005), observational and experiential learning (i.e., trainer demonstration, behavioral rehearsal) are long-recognized as emphases of effective training workshops. Corresponding recommendations (Beidas & Kendall, 2010; Miller et\u00a0al., 2006) still inform notions of workshop training as a preparatory learning context wherein workforce members observe and rehearse delivery of an EBP to build requisite clinical skills. Later emergence of phasic models of EBP implementation, like Aarons and colleagues\u2019 (2011) Exploration-Preparation-ImplementationSustainment (EPIS) framework, have increased awareness of other implementation strategies. These may include exploratory strategies that predate and inform workshop training (i.e., initial needs assessment or leadership consultation), or implementation and sustainment strategies subsequently applied to augment and sustain workshop gains. Within this phased framework, workshop training is a critical preparatory event whereby workforce members become capable of demonstrating fidelity, or one\u2019s ability to skillfully deliver an EBP like CM as its developers intended (McHugh & Barlow, 2010), to signal individual readiness for its subsequent implementation.\nUntil recently, workshop training for EBPs like CM has typically occurred in-person. However, onset of COVID-19 diversified the nature of workforce development activities such that many now use virtual platforms (Cross-Technology Transfer Center Workgroup on Virtual Learning, 2021). While virtual trainings may eliminate some traditional costs (i.e., travel, in-person facility), their utility for preparing attendees to demonstrate EBP delivery skills\u2013and thereby implementation readiness\u2013remains unknown. Likewise, the expense of virtual trainings is not well-documented, nor does extant literature clearly address comparative cost-effectiveness of in-person and virtual workshop training for EBPs like CM. Consequently, the current work seeks to address these gaps in the EBP training literature, using data from an ongoing, multi-cohort trial (Becker et\u00a0al., 2021) that examines implementation of prize-based CM in opioid treatment programs (OTPs). In this trial, OTP staff participate in initial workshop training and complete a role-play as a post-training assessment of fidelity. Mid-trial advent of COVID-19 necessitated a shift\nin procedures between its 1st and 2nd cohorts, recruited 15 months apart, with workshop training offered inperson with the initial cohort and virtually with the latter cohort. The resulting natural experiment provided a timely opportunity to compare the utility, expense, and cost-effectiveness of these two modalities for workshop training delivery."

Briefly, it is a type 3 hybrid trial (Curran et\u00a0al., 2012) with cluster-randomization of New England OTPs receiving one of two sets of implementation strategies: (1) an addiction technology transfer center (ATTC) approach, consisting of workshop training followed by performance feedback and monthly facilitation calls (Squires et\u00a0al., 2008); or (2) an enhanced ATTC approach, with the ATTC components augmented by implementation and sustainment facilitation (Garner et\u00a0al., 2017) and pay-for-performance incentives (Garner et\u00a0al., 2018). Over its 5-year span, the trial will enroll 28\u201330 OTPs via staggering of three cohorts. OTP administrators each nominate up to five counselors, who must meet as inclusion criteria: (1) maintenance of an active caseload and (2) willingness to engage in the trial\u2019s training and implementation support activities.\nThe trial adheres to the EPIS framework (Aarons et\u00a0al., 2011), with an exploration phase wherein trial participation is discussed with OTP leadership and staff. Participating staff then complete 4 months of preparation phase activities, including workshop training, to establish readiness to deliver a CM protocol. In a 9-month implementation phase, they deliver the CM protocol whilst receiving active implementation support. In a 6-month sustainment phase, staff can maintain the CM protocol with aid of didactic resources on a centralized website, but absent active implementation support. The current work analyzes the utility and expense of the trial\u2019s preparation phase activities, namely workshop training and a subsequent role-play serving as an outcome assessment. Other aforementioned activities, like performance feedback and monthly facilitation calls, are initiated in the trial\u2019s implementation phase and not further discussed here. Notably, this trial was approved by the Brown University institutional review board (Protocol #1811002260) in December 2018, with subsequent amendments approved in May 2020 to enable virtual delivery of workshop training."

Costs that did not vary at a clinician-level (e.g., trainer time, facilities) were allocated across a given OTP\u2019s staff, whereas those for research activities (e.g., obtaining informed consent for trial participation) that would not have been incurred were an OTP to independently implement CM were excluded. Development costs (e.g., creating training materials) were tracked separately as they would not otherwise be incurred in future replication of workshop training. Costs were estimated for two major activities\u2013workshop training, and post-training role-plays.\nWith respect to workshop training, this included labor costs corresponding to time spent by OTP staff, trainers, and study staff to attend and travel to the training; actual travel expenses; and actual costs paid for materials, training space, and meals. For post-training role-plays, this included labor costs for time spent by OTP staff in recording and submission as well as scoring by study staff; time for study staff to edit pre-recorded training videos; and actual material costs of audio-recorders. Costs for the initial cohort were inflated to 2020 dollars based on the 2019\u20132020 Consumer Price Indexes, as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (2021).\nIn terms of labor costs, annual wage estimates for OTP staff were based on self-report of annual income elicited via a counselor survey completed at trial enrollment, whereas annual income for study staff was extracted from administrative records. The trainer was an external consultant paid $100/h. All wages were adjusted to hourly rates with data from the US Office of Personnel Management (2021), to which a 30% fringe and overhead rate was applied. Detailed logs tracked the amount of time spent by OTP and study staff on specific activities, whereas the trainer submitted invoices with detailed time breakdowns.\nAs for costing of travel time and expenses, the distance and time spent by the trainer, study staff, and OTP staff traveling to and from workshop training was calculated using the physical address of each individual\u2019s respective place of employment as a starting point and the physical address of the training venue as endpoint. Mileage for all involved was costed at the 2019 federal mileage reimbursement rate ($0.56). Hotel costs for an overnight stay of three OTP staff in the initial cohort who worked a great distance from the inperson workshop training venue were obtained from administrative records.\nCosting for materials (e.g., recorders, technology support), meals, and training space was obtained from administrative records. In the initial cohort, one of the three inperson trainings was held at a local venue, whereas the two others were held in a heavily subsidized university conference center. Thus, technology support and meals for all three in-person trainings were costed at standard rates for each local venue. In the latter cohort, Zoom access was subsidized by the university, but was costed using a standard 2020 license rate for an organization.\nCost\u2011Effectiveness\nComparative cost-effectiveness of in-person vs. virtual workshop training was determined via two key steps: (1) adjusted between-cohort differences were estimated for costs relative to achievement of beginning/advanced proficiency benchmarks, using ordinary least squares, and (2) an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated to\nspecify the ratio of between-cohort cost differences to the difference in training outcomes. The ICER indicates what resources must be invested to obtain an additional unit of outcome at a given willingness-to-pay. While confidence intervals and tests of statistical significance can be independently calculated from linear regression for cost-outcome differences, standard ICER methods are problematic as a ratio of two variables. Thus, to estimate statistical uncertainty for the current ICER, cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were calculated via 500 bootstrapped samples from original trial data to create an empirical distribution of expected costs and outcomes. Across replications, the strategy with highest probability of being optimal for a range of willingness-to-pay values was then identified."

The solid line indicates a near certainty that virtual workshop training is cost-effective for OTP staff to achieve beginning proficiency up to a willingness-to-pay threshold of $5500 per counselor, which converges to 98% likelihood of greater cost-effectiveness as the willingness-to-pay threshold increases (i.e., further down the X-axis). The hatched line suggests a near certainty that virtual workshop training is cost-effective for OTP staff to achieve advanced proficiency up to a willingness-to-pay threshold of $1000 per counselor. Beyond that threshold, the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve decreases to a probability of 0.9 at $3750, 0.8 at $8000, and 0.78 above $8000\u2013which means that, even at willingnessto-pay thresholds above $8000, there remains a 78% chance that virtual workshop training is the more cost-effective of the two modalities.\nAll costs are actual per-counselor costs, based on the recruited cohorts of opioid treatment programs\u2019 staff for in-person workshop training (n = 26) and virtual workshop training (n = 31)\n1 3"

            "text": "Efforts to disseminate EBPs like CM continue, in hopes of improving the quality of care received by persons with substance use disorders, and for which evaluation of costeffectiveness is sorely needed. Through opportunistic use of data from a multi-cohort trial seeking to implement CM in New England\u2013based OTPs, the current work examined inperson vs. virtual workshop trainings via quasi-experimental comparison. Advantages of virtual workshop training included (1) more widespread success, albeit by a statistically non-significant margin, in preparing OTP staff to develop CM skills signifying beginning (+ 12%) and advanced proficiency (+14%), (2) a 44% reduction in overall expense, largely due to absence of travel and facilities costs, equating to a $399 per-counselor incremental savings, and (3) greater cost-effectiveness across a range of willingnessto-pay values that decision-makers are apt to consider. Findings offer converging evidence for virtual delivery of educational activities for health professionals, as observed in its feasible application in medical education (Almarzooq et\u00a0al., 2020; O\u2019Doherty et\u00a0al., 2018) as well as its comparable effectiveness to more resource-intensive in-person methods of psychotherapy training (Moore et\u00a0al., 2021; Soll et\u00a0al., 2021). Thus, current findings are among those that may inform future decisions by EBP purveyors and sponsoring entities alike regarding fiscal and educational benefits of opting for virtual delivery of workshop training and other implementation support activities for behavior therapies like CM.\nWith regard to effectiveness, in-person and virtual workshop trainings each provided adequate preparation for most OTP staff to begin delivering prize-based CM\u2013given the broader context of a hybrid type 3 trial wherein these staff were to subsequently receive longitudinal implementation support. This extended opportunity to subsequently improve\nCM skillfulness is salient, given that a minority of OTP staff in both cohorts (31\u201345%) achieved a more aspirational fidelity benchmark that signifies advanced proficiency in this behavior therapy. Attainment of more advanced CM skillfulness is strongly recommended for implementation success, given its identification in prior training research as a predictor of both sustained skill in delivery of CM protocols and enhanced therapeutic response among clients with whom those protocols are implemented (Hartzler et\u00a0al., 2014, 2017; Petry et\u00a0al., 2012). In the current work, as in broader extant therapy training literature, the focus was on comparing learning modalities and methods rather than identifying characteristics of individual learners that predict successful training outcomes. Notably, prior CM training research reported no moderating influences of traditional indices of demography and professional background (Henggeler et\u00a0al., 2013). Nevertheless, the burgeoning emergence of virtual therapy training\u2013and its apparent cost-effectiveness\u2013suggests there may be utility in examining other characteristics of individual learners. Measurement of one\u2019s experience and/or comfort with virtual technology may have been unavailable in the current work, but inclusion of such constructs in future research on virtual therapy training will enable examination of their potential influence.\nCurrent findings regarding comparative costs and costeffectiveness of these trainings reflect an important, often overlooked focus on fiscal considerations surrounding EBP training and implementation support activities (Reeves et\u00a0al., 2019; Roberts et\u00a0al., 2019). As outlined by Hinde and colleagues (2020), several established methods are now available for such economic evaluation. In the current work, the intent was to utilize available counselor-level outcome data to inform organization-level perspectives of decisionmakers about the respective value of two approaches to EBP training\u2013itself a necessary, but rarely sufficient, preparatory activity for which community-based expectations for skillsbased outcomes can vary tremendously. By examining differences in costs of the two training approaches in relation to differences in their respective skill-based outcomes (via incremental cost-effectiveness ratios), the resulting guidance will aid decision-makers across a wide range of circumstances wherein workforce development efforts may be undertaken. Future economic evaluation is merited concerning virtual delivery of other implementation support activities for CM as well as for other useful treatment and recovery practices for persons with substance use disorders. As regionally based intermediary purveyor organizations linked within a national network, the SAMHSA-funded ATTCs have a primary role to play in such work. Beyond the breadth of useful treatment and recovery practices for which they accelerate adoption, Covid-19 has spurred a host of virtual innovations (e.g., listening sessions, virtual process walkthroughs, \u2018live\u2019 supervision) within this network to facilitate\n1 3\nimplementation support for EBPs (Cross-Technology Transfer Center Workgroup on Virtual Learning, 2021).\nStudy caveats should be acknowledged. Foremost among these are a quasi-experimental design that did not allow for control of potential 3rd-variable influences\u2013leaving open possibility that observed advantages of the latter training cohort may be attributable to factors other than the virtual delivery of their workshop training. As one example, advent of COVID-19 necessitated efforts by study staff to respond to pervasive change in OTPs\u2019 medication dosing and clinical services (Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services, 2020; SAMHSA, 2020). Notably, this responsivity broadly targeted necessary assistance with integrating the focal CM paradigm into amended OTP service routines (i.e., use of virtual \u201cfishbowls\u201d in telehealth visits), but did not alter the training workshop\u2019s core learning objectives or educational activities. Relatedly, onset of COVID-19 prolonged the time between the two cohorts, during which the lead trainer and study staff engaged in quality improvement discussions that may have augmented subsequent training gains through greater opportunity for reflective practice. Corresponding adaptations to the training curriculum included (1) its distributed delivery in briefer sections over multiple weeks (contrasted with en masse delivery in a single workshop day), which coincides with a previously identified training preference among OTP personnel (Hartzler & Rabun, 2014), and (2) curriculum exposure via synchronous and asynchronous learning. A further caveat was the prominent between-cohort difference in educational attainment\u2013given its identification as a predictor of receptive CM adoption attitudes in prior research (Fuller et\u00a0 al., 2007; Hartzler et\u00a0 al., 2012a, b)\u2013though notably, it was a covariate in all inferential comparisons of the two cohorts. Other sampling caveats concerning the size and representativeness of this collective workforce sample may be mitigated by its derivation from 18 OTPs, located across the New England region. Use of the described peer role-plays to derive fidelity-based outcome measures, in lieu of standardized patient procedures traditionally employed in clinical education, is another acknowledged methodological caveat. A final caveat is uncertainty about the reliability with which CM workshop training effects reported herein may be achieved by other community-based trainers, given absence of credentialing processes that exist as trainer preparation for other EBPs (e.g., motivational interviewing network of trainers). The current workshop training effort may have been enhanced by (1) subject matter expertise of the involved trainer (CR), (2) availability of consultative feedback from the lead author (BH) and principal investigators of the parent trial (SB, BG), and (3) assistance from the study\u2019s training support team (SL, NC, JY, KY, CM).\nCaveats notwithstanding, the current evaluation offers initial evidence to support virtual training as a useful and\ncost-effective means of preparing OTP personnel to capably deliver a prize-based CM protocol. These preliminary findings await replication through future study. To that end, similar economic evaluation efforts may be directed toward CM training workshops targeted to clinical personnel of alternative settings, to other implementation support activities for CM, and broadly to training and implementation support activities for other useful treatment and recovery practices. Future efforts may also consider the cost-effectiveness of hybrid approaches to workforce development that mix or combine virtual and in-person modes of delivery of distinct segments of an EBP training curriculum. Such hybridization may retain unique benefits of each, perhaps offering synergy in parallel to the manner in which flipping the classroom (Bergmann & Sams, 2012) is thought to enhance a combination of didactic and applied learning. With virtual technology having now enveloped professional work in many sectors, the addiction field stands to benefit from greater understanding of the fiscal and conceptual implications of its role in workforce development.\nAcknowledgements The authors wish to thank the staff of the participating OTPs for allowing their efforts to be examined.\nAuthor Contribution All authors contributed to the study conception and design.
