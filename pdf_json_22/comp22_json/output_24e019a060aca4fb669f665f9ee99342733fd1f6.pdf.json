(2) Compare features of current systems against e-A&F best practices. (3) Generate hypotheses on how e-A&F systems may impact patient care and outcomes. Methods: We searched MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), and CINAHL (Ebsco) databases to December 31, 2020. Two reviewers independently performed selection, extraction, and quality appraisal (Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool). System features were compared with 18 best practices derived from Clinical Performance Feedback Intervention Theory. We then used realist concepts to generate hypotheses on mechanisms of e-A&F impact. Results are reported in accordance with the PRISMA statement. Results: Our search yielded 4301 unique articles. We included 88 studies evaluating 65 e-A&F systems, spanning a diverse range of clinical areas, including medical, surgical, general practice, etc. Systems adopted a median of 8 best practices (interquartile range 6\u201310), with 32 systems providing near real-time feedback data and 20 systems incorporating action planning. High-confidence hypotheses suggested that favorable e-A&F systems prompted specific actions, particularly enabled by timely and role-specific feedback (including patient lists and individual performance data) and embedded action plans, in order to improve system usage, care quality, and patient outcomes. Conclusions: e-A&F systems continue to be developed for many clinical applications. Yet, several systems still lack basic features recommended by best practice, such as timely feedback and action planning. Systems should focus on actionability, by providing real-time data for feedback that is specific to user roles, with embedded action plans. Protocol Registration: PROSPERO CRD42016048695.",

(2) Compare features of current systems against e-A&F best practices. (3) Generate hypotheses on how e-A&F systems may impact patient care and outcomes. Methods: We searched MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), and CINAHL (Ebsco) databases to December 31, 2020. Two reviewers independently performed selection, extraction, and quality appraisal (Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool). System features were compared with 18 best practices derived from Clinical Performance Feedback Intervention Theory. We then used realist concepts to generate hypotheses on mechanisms of e-A&F impact. Results are reported in accordance with the PRISMA statement. Results: Our search yielded 4301 unique articles. We included 88 studies evaluating 65 e-A&F systems, spanning a diverse range of clinical areas, including medical, surgical, general practice, etc. Systems adopted a median of 8 best practices (interquartile range 6\u201310), with 32 systems providing near real-time feedback data and 20 systems incorporating action planning. High-confidence hypotheses suggested that favorable e-A&F systems prompted specific actions, particularly enabled by timely and role-specific feedback (including patient lists and individual performance data) and embedded action plans, in order to improve system usage, care quality, and patient outcomes. Conclusions: e-A&F systems continue to be developed for many clinical applications. Yet, several systems still lack basic features recommended by best practice, such as timely feedback and action planning. Systems should focus on actionability, by providing real-time data for feedback that is specific to user roles, with embedded action plans.

            "text": "Audit and feedback (A&F) is widely used to improve care quality and health outcomes.1 Through summarizing clinical performance over time (audit), and presenting this information to health professionals and their organizations (feedback), it can drive improvements in health outcomes.1\u20133 There is established literature on predictors of A&F effectiveness, such as targeting low baselines, delivering feedback through supervisors, and frequent feedback.1,3,4 This has led to theories of how A&F produces change in clinical practice and hypothesized features of best practice.5,6 We previously developed a clinical performance feedback intervention theory (CP-FIT): a framework for A&F interventions describing how feedback works and factors that influence success.5 However, little is known about to what extent this translates to automated or computerized forms of A&F using digital care records and computational approaches, which are becoming increasingly adopted.\nComputerized or electronic audit and feedback (e-A&F) systems, often delivered as \u201cdashboards,\u201d generally incorporate visualization elements to deliver feedback of clinical performance.7 With increasing availability of linked care record data, they offer potential advantages over manual A&F methods through lower costs of producing the audits and quicker feedback.7 Developing e-A&F systems\nhave also changed the dynamics of how clinical performance is understood, evolving from single graphical displays requiring human assistance for feedback, into automated multi-functional feedback displays with interactive components.8 Over the last decade, e-A&F systems have moved away from static reports, as interactive interfaces enable users to \u201cdrill down,\u201d filter and prioritize the data, carrying greater potential for flexibility and specificity in feedback.1 EA&F systems are generally used away from the point-of-care (unlike clinical decision support tools), but can produce timely improvements on individual, team, or organizational levels depending on how feedback data is used to review care performance.7\nTwo previous systematic reviews examining e-A&F, yielded limited insights into the characteristics of successful systems due to the heterogeneity of studies and inclusion criteria.7,9 The most recent (2017) review focused on behavior change theory and included only 7 randomized controlled trials (RCTs).7 This needed updating and extending to consider a wider range of current e-A&F systems in more detail.\nA&F systems continue to demonstrate highly variable effects on patient care, though effect sizes have been plateauing for some time.4 Rather than simply studying outcomes, a greater focus on optimization of intervention design is required.10 There is a need for more comprehensive evidence of e-A&F that considers and extends best practice theory to define successful features and components of these systems.7,9 Previous studies have shown that contextual factors need to be considered, which directly affect e-A&F implementation, such as data infrastructure and existing ways of working.7,9,11 A narrative synthesis allows deeper exploration of intervention components, contextual factors, and mechanisms of action to generate further hypotheses regarding outcomes and effect modifiers.12\nThe aim of this study was to summarize and evaluate the current state of e-A&F, synthesizing the literature to provide useful evidence through learning from successes and failures. Using an extended theoretical framework, we explored how e-A&F system design may be\noptimized to reduce variability in outcomes."

For each included article, we performed a supplementary search (undertaken up to January 31, 2021) that consisted of reference list, citation, and related article searching to identify further relevant articles. Related article and citation searching was performed in Google Scholar and limited to the first 100 articles to maintain relevance.\nStudy selection and data extraction The inclusion criteria are presented in Table 1. We included all peerreviewed studies on interactive e-A&F systems used by health professionals for care improvements that were implemented in clinical practice. Two reviewers (JT and BB) independently screened titles and abstracts using the inclusion criteria. Citations that were\ndeemed relevant by either reviewer had full texts obtained. All full manuscripts were then independently read by the 2 reviewers, and the inclusion criteria reapplied with any disagreements being resolved through discussion. Data extraction and quality appraisal (see below) were undertaken concurrently using a standardized data extraction tool (Supplementary File S2) by JT and reviewed independently by a second researcher (BB). Further discussion of the data and resolving of discrepancies occurred at weekly meetings. Data were collected regarding studies\u2019 characteristics, outcomes, and features of the e-A&F system being studied."

The results are presented as 1\u20134 stars, allowing direct comparison between different study types. This was incorporated into a GRADE-CERQual assessment to explicitly evaluate the confidence placed in each individual set of findings from objective 3 (see below).16 The GRADE-CERQuaL approach incorporates 4 components including methodological limitations, relevance to the review question, coherence of the finding, and adequacy of data.

As in CP-FIT, mechanisms (M) were defined as underlying explanations of how and why an intervention works, related to the feedback itself, the recipient, and the wider context.5,19 Each ICMO configuration was assessed through GRADE-CERQual to explicitly evaluate our confidence for each hypothesis.

For readability, we focus on high confidence and novel findings related to e-A&F, with a full list of ICMO configurations and CER-QUAL ratings in Supplementary File S5. A substantial proportion of studies (over 30%) reported insignificant results or included negative findings, allowing us to compare and contrast ICMOs for these systems.23,25,32,34,37,38,40,42,43,45\u2013 47,50,53,54,61,62,70,72,73,77,85,89,93,99,101,108 A large majority of the codes arose from CP-FIT, though some nuanced codes building on CP-FIT were identified inductively (see Supplementary Files S5 and S6).5 When compared with the other mechanisms within CP-FIT, actionability appeared to be the most important mechanism in producing clinical improvements.21\u201363,65\u201397,99\u2013108 Actionability is the ability of e-A&F systems to directly facilitate behaviors for users. Namely, the more an e-A&F system successfully and directly supported clinical behaviors with tangible or concrete next steps, the more users felt empowered and motivated to act on these behaviors more effectively, also increasing achievability and controllability of the task.21\u201363,65\u201397,99\u2013108 Other mechanisms within CP-FIT (eg, reduced complexity, perceived relative advantage, see Supplementary File S6 for full descriptions and explanations) often contributed to successful e-A&F systems, but were less important as influencing factors, and were insufficient to produce clinical improvements alone.23,25,32,34,37,38,40,42,43,45\u2013 47,50,53,54,61,62,70,72,73,77,85,89,93,99,101,108,109 Contextual factors were also key effect modifiers of e-A&F systems, as they significantly enabled or limited implementation and engagement with each system.21,23\u201325,27\u201330,32\u201335,37\u201359,63,65\u201370,73\u201391,93\u201395,99\u2013108 However, despite strong organization and contextual backing, systems without actionable feedback were unlikely to result in clinical improvements.23,25,32,34,37,38,40,42,43,45\u2013 47,50,53,54,61,62,70,72,73,77,85,89,93,99,101,108,109\nThree key e-A&F intervention factors were identified that enhanced actionability and were more likely to result in clinical improvements:\n\u2022 The availability of real-time data for feedback \u2022 Feedback functions specific to user roles \u2022 Action plans embedded within systems\nTimely feedback data as a prerequisite to actionability Systems that provided immediately updated or \u201cnear real-time\u201d feedback resulted in higher engagement and were more likely to report successful outcomes.21,22,24,26,27,31,33,39,41,44,52,55,57,66,70,71,74\u2013 77,79\u201383,86\u201388,90\u201392,94,97,102,105\u2013107 The timeliness of feedback enabled the data to be viewed as more credible and representative of performance.21,22,24,26,27,31,33,39,41,44,52,55,57,58,66,70,71,75,76,80,82,83,86\u2013 88,90\u201392,94,97,101,102,105\u2013107 Importantly, it was reported as a prerequisite for actionability, with less timely feedback frequently been seen as extra work, and occurring outside existing workflow.24,27,55,77,83,102,107 Although almost all systems provided more timely feedback compared with manual audit and previous systems, several of these studies reported that without immediate feedback, it remained too long for effective action to be taken despite many users finding the feedback \u201chelpful\u201d or \u201cinsightful.\u201d 40,48\u2013 50,53,54,61,73,85,98 Likewise, the lack of real-time feedback was reported to be a barrier to usage in several studies.48\u201350,53,73,85\nNo e-A&F systems providing annual feedback reported significant improvements in patient care, with several studies reporting\nQuality appraisal\n(4* being lowest risk of bias)\n4* 4 (4%) 3* 37 (42%) 2* 33 (38%) 1* 14 (16%)\nStudy type Randomized controlled trial 21 (24%)\nNonrandomized controlled trial 3 (3%) Cohort study 5 (6%) Before and after study 8 (9%) Cross sectional study 3 (3%) Other quantitative study 11 (12%) Qualitative study 27 (31%) Mixed methods study 10 (11%)\nContinent North America 57 (65%)\nEurope 26 (30%) Asia 4 (4%) Australia 1 (1%)\nSetting Hospital care (including\nsecondary and tertiary settings)\n51 (58%)\nOutpatient care (including\nspecialty and primary care settings)\n36 (41%)\nNursing home 1 (1%)\nSpecialty area Medication safety 19 (22%)\nDiabetes 17 (19%) Cardiovascular 15 (17%) Respiratory 6 (7%) Oncology 9 (10%) Nephrology 2 (2%) Geriatrics 4 (4%) General medicine 4 (4%) Infectious disease 11 (12%) Surgery 5 (6%) Obstetrics 1 (1%) Pediatrics 3 (3%) Radiology 4 (4%) Psychiatry (including\nsubstance misuse)\n5 (6%)\naCounts may add to more than 100% where papers are in multiple catego-\nries.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /jam ia/article/29/6/1106/6546606 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\nTable 3.

The majority were \u201cfrontline\u201d users responsible for delivering care (eg, doctors, nurses, pharmacists), with others being \u201cmanagerial\u201d users (eg, managers, leadership, or organizational roles). To be directly actionable, feedback needed to be specific to user roles: feedback to \u201cfrontline\u201d users mainly required patient lists, whereas for feedback to \u201cmanagerial\u201d users, the priority was\nhighlighting the specifics for individual performance. Many successful systems presented specific feedback on both patient lists and individual or practice performance levels,24,27\u201330,35,36,48,60,68,69,74,77\u2013 80,84,88,90,91,96,97,103,107 with various using functions such as color coding and sorting , 21,26,27,35,36,41,48,49,55,57,58,60,66,68\u201370,74\u201380,83,90\u2013 92,102,107 to enhance prioritization of actions to be taken.\nPatient lists to \u201cfrontline\u201d users generally highlighted gaps in recommended care, supported by team or practice level performance feedback (particularly for primary care).26,55,57,58,66,71,81\u201383,104 These electronic patient lists, were seen as more efficient than standard care, with the e-A&F system reporting superior effects to alerts within the electronic medical record.57,71,80,104 Many studies without user-specific feedback including lack of patient lists,23,37,38,42,53,85,89,93,99,108 or individual performance data,40,61,62,70 did not demonstrate significant improvements to patient outcomes. Several of these studies reported specificity of the data (both on an individual practitioner level and a patient level) to be a barrier to actionability and usage.37,38,54,85 For example, Filardo et al37,38,109 described a benchmarking and case review tool, which combined education initiatives with feedback on aggregate\nFigure 2.

It presents key findings, supported by intervention-context-mechanism-outcome (ICMO) configurations along with supporting references and GRADE-CERQual assessments.16,19 Three key intervention factors were identified that enhanced actionability and were more likely to result in clinical improvements, including the availability of timely data for feedback, feedback functions specific to user roles, and action plans embedded within systems.

With a strong \u201cimprovement culture\u201d led by the leadership team, staff viewed their own feedback critically and over time, enabled downstream improvements even without prompts from the leadership team.27 In contrast, Crits-Christoph et al25 designed a system to collect performance ratings of therapeutic alliance, treatment satisfaction, and drug and alcohol use. To protect clinician employment and confidentiality, individual clinicians and patients could not be identified and so users struggled to act on the feedback.25 Despite monthly meetings, leadership support, and financial incentives, no significant improvements in clinical outcomes measures were noted.25\nAction plans were more effective when embedded within the system The e-A&F systems that incorporated action plans as part of their multi-faceted interventions appeared to produce better results.24,33,35,36,44,55,56,62,66,73,75,76,79,84,91 For example, Feldstein et al35,36 designed a dashboard that showed not only color-coded\ngraphs of clinical performance compared with guidelines but also had a list of prompts for how to achieve recommended targets for individual patients (eg, prompts to conduct a screening test or adjusting a medication dose). This resulted in significant improvements in care scores for several chronic disease areas, with users feeling \u201cempowered\u201d to proactively manage wider patient needs, particularly for broader clinical roles.35 Similarly, a website reported percentages of patients meeting BP targets primary care professionals, and importantly included suggested actions designed to be simple and achievable.56 This allowed direct actions to address gaps in performance and resulted in significant increases in the use of guideline-recommended medications for blood pressure.56\nConversely, when users were asked to come up with their own action plan either as part of meetings or as part of wider quality improvement activity groups, it reduced actionability, and at times resulted in unrealistic action plans and unattainable goals.23,25,32,34,42,43,45\u2013 47,54,72,99,101,108 In a medication safety system targeting patients with acute kidney injury, pharmacists input their own recommendations for doctors, rather than doctors being able to direct action changes in medication.72 This resulted in a time delay before the action plan could be implemented and no improvements in adverse drug reactions or time taken to stop nephrotoxic medications.72"

            "text": "This review summarized 88 studies of e-A&F systems, demonstrating their wide range of settings, applications, and characteristics.\nDespite automated audit and advantages in analysis compared with manual methods, it was insufficient for e-A&F systems to just feedback more data, or solely present measurements and targets for performance. When compared with generic A&F best practices, there was an increased expectation for e-A&F systems to present more precise and nuanced feedback, to make it easy to act on or present viable next steps to improve patient care. Established effective components of wider A&F interventions include timely feedback, individualized feedback and action planning.1,5 Yet, even some recent eA&F systems lacked these, with extensive inconsistencies between different systems. Our review highlights more nuanced requirements for e-A&F, including the availability of immediate or \u2018near realtime\u2019 data for feedback; feedback functions that were specific to user roles (including \u201cpatient lists\u201d for frontline users and \u201cindividual performance feedback\u201d for senior or managerial users); and embedding action plans within systems. A key consideration for successful e-A&F was enabling feedback to be actionable, yet underlying contexts of organizations, resources, and user characteristics deeply affected the uptake of e-A&F systems, considerably influencing their effects in several studies.\nComparison with existing literature Our review builds on wider evidence regarding A&F, revealing important findings for computerized interventions.1,3,4 In particular, eA&F systems offer opportunities to enhance the positive effects of 3 known generic A&F best practices, including timeliness, specificity, and action-planning.1,3,4,6,10 Our findings present a more explicit understanding of these, recommending the provision of real-time data, feedback functions tailored to user roles (particularly patient lists to frontline users and individual performance data to managerial roles), along with embedded action plans. With an increasing uptake of e-A&F, wider A&F best practices could be extended to take these into account.1,5,6 Our review utilized a list of 18 best practices, focusing on more objective features to aid clarity, but this was only one way of classifying e-A&F system components. Though there is considerable overlap, others have proposed slightly different classifications.4,6,10,110 Our approach was guided by the reporting within papers, and explicitly considered organizational factors and cointerventions, though omitted more complex and subjective characteristics that were less evidently reported, such as trust or identity.1,5,6,10\nTwo systematic reviews on e-A&F systems have been performed previously in 2015 and 2017. Dowding et al (2015) included 11 studies on dashboards, highlighting that contextual factors were key to the usage of e-A&F systems and hence the effect on outcomes. Tuti et al7 examined 7 RCTs, but noted highly heterogeneous effect sizes. Our review builds on these findings, adopting broader inclusion criteria to examine a wider range of studies in a narrative synthesis to identify characteristics of e-A&F systems more likely to result in care improvements. Consistent with findings from these 2 previous reviews, several contextual factors within included \u201cbest practices\u201d appeared to be beneficial in encouraging the uptake of systems and positive outcomes. In particular, leadership support and intraorganizational networks appeared to support user role-specific feedback, strengthening motivation and accountability to act on feedback data."

However, even some recent systems lacked basic features recommended by best practice, such as timely feedback and action planning. With e-A&F systems increasing in their poten-\ntial functions and complexity, it suggests a need for codesign with relevant stakeholders to increase usability, participation, and sustainability that takes into account theorized \u201cbest practices.\u201d114,115 Otherwise, with increasing complexity, computerized tools are more likely to result in nonadoption and abandonment.116,117 Enhancing functionality of e-A&F systems alone would be futile if computerized tools failed in their uptake, implementation, or sustainability."

            "text": "This is the largest review of studies focusing on e-A&F to date. It incorporated CP-FIT and applied realist principles in exploring a wide range of literature, from RCTs to qualitative studies to generate a rich insight into the current state of e-A&F systems. Our synthesis considered all studies regardless of methodological quality but was guided by our quality appraisal and GRADE-CERQual assessment in the confidence of findings. Applying CP-FIT allowed a greater depth of analysis based on theoretical findings for wider A&F and a framework of hypothesized \u201cbest practices.\u201d However, use of CP-FIT may at the same time have limited novel themes, as findings may have been biased to preformed constructs. Through CP-FIT, we aimed to extend existing knowledge frameworks on wider A&F through application to e-A&F systems. Though we attempted to focus on findings specific to e-A&F, it was not always possible to ascertain whether features for success or failure were specific to just e-A&F or inherent to A&F interventions more generally.\nAs with other literature syntheses, our results are limited to the reporting and transparency of the authors within original studies. Though we propose and prioritize key mechanisms for success, our review was not designed to quantify casual effects or relative effect sizes. There is a degree of uncertainty in our highlighted mechanisms having a significant casual effect on process and outcomes and it is possible that underreported features may have greater effects on patient care. Our review likely identified studies with a predisposition towards recruiting participants from organizations with better resources and infrastructures, particularly in information technology, and hence our findings may be less applicable to low resource settings. We also restricted our search to published articles within\nmedical databases and Google scholar to focus on systems for healthcare, but searching of further technology focused databases (eg, IEEE Xplore and ACM Digital Library) may have yielded further studies. Iterative interpretation of data is a core component of realist synthesis, but this has obvious implications for the replication of findings from the review, as others may have interpreted the evidence differently."

Yet, it remains that several systems still lack basic fea-\ntures recommended by best practice, such as timely feedback and action planning. e-A&F systems should consistently incorporate best practices that enhance actionability by using real-time data, feeding back in ways that are specific to user roles, and providing embedded action plans. Future research needs to address inconsistencies in eA&F system features, to ensure development incorporates features recommended by best practice, which can increase actionability of feedback and may improve outcomes."
