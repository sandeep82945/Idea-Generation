    "abstractText": "Abstract Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the risk factors associated with suicidal behavior and thus, prioritizing its prevention is recommended. Methods: This study systematically reviewed the global evidence on the incidence of suicide/suicidal attempts and the trend in suicidal rates during the COVID-19 pandemic. Cross-sectional and cohort studies investigating the outcomes of suicidal death and suicidal attempts at any setting during the COVID-19 pandemic were searched in Medline, Embase, and PsycINFO databases for papers published from December 2019 to May 2021. Results: Out of 1052 studies18 studies with 12,746 suicidal attempts and 33,345 suicidal deaths were included in the final analysis. The mental health impact of social distancing, COVID-19 quarantine, and financial crises due to loss of employment were associated risk factors with suicide and/or suicidal attempts during the COVID-19 pandemic. Six common thematic recommendations for preventing suicidal deaths and suicidal attempts were identified. Conclusions: Unexpected behavior changes during the COVID-19 pandemic may have contributed to the increasing trend of suicidal attempts reported. Domestic conflicts and violence, financial loss, anxiety and depression, and preexisting mental health condition/s should be considered in preventing suicidal attempts and deaths secondary to the COVID 19 pandemic. Early detection and timely intervention for individuals with suicidal behavior is crucial and collated recommendations in the current study can be utilized for those preventive interventions. More systematic suicide risk screening process should be introduced who are at risk, along with an evidence base prevention approach.",

Cross-sectional and cohort studies investigating the outcomes of suicidal death and suicidal attempts at any setting during the COVID-19 pandemic were searched in Medline, Embase, and PsycINFO databases for papers published from December 2019 to May 2021.\nResults: Out of 1052 studies18 studies with 12,746 suicidal attempts and 33,345 suicidal deaths were included in the final analysis. The mental health impact of social distancing, COVID-19 quarantine, and financial crises due to loss of employment were associated risk factors with suicide and/or suicidal attempts during the COVID-19 pandemic. Six common thematic recommendations for preventing suicidal deaths and suicidal attempts were identified.\nConclusions: Unexpected behavior changes during the COVID-19 pandemic may have contributed to the increasing trend of suicidal attempts reported. Domestic conflicts and violence, financial loss, anxiety and depression, and preexisting mental health condition/s should be considered in preventing suicidal attempts and deaths secondary to the COVID 19 pandemic. Early detection and timely intervention for individuals with suicidal behavior is crucial and collated recommendations in the current study can be utilized for those preventive interventions. More systematic suicide risk screening process should be introduced who are at risk, along with an evidence base prevention approach.\nKeywords: COVID-19 pandemic, Lockdown, Mental health, Suicide, Suicidal ideation, Suicide attempted, SARS-CoV-2 infection\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

The first case of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan, China, on December 31st, 2019, and afterward continued to spread across nearly 200 countries, causing an infection fatality rate of ~ 0.15% [2]. Considering the alarming levels of spread and severity, World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a pandemic on March 11th, 2020 [3]. Almost all the countries in the world provoked public health measures such as home confinement, closure of schools and universities, travel restrictions, and limit/ withhold social and physical distancing, while some countries declared it a public health emergency [4]. Many countries had to impose periods of lockdowns as\n*Correspondence: malshanilakshika@gmail.com; malshanilakshika@ahs.pdn. ac.lk\n1 Department of Nursing, Faculty of Allied Health Sciences, University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya 20400, Sri Lanka Full list of author information is available at the end of the article\nan attempt to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2. By early April 2020, more than one-third of the global population was under some form of movement restriction [5]. These strategies implemented in different countries intensively have caused substantial social and economic disruptions to individuals and the whole community [6]. While this disease has already directly impacted the physical health of millions of people, it is also causing mental health problems globally [7\u20139]. The evidence on the mental health harms caused by the response to COVID-19 found to be overwhelming, and studies on the general public revealed lower psychological well-being and higher scores of anxiety and depression compared to before COVID-19 [10]. The WHO also expressed its concern on the effect of COVID-19 on mental health and psychosocial consequences of an individual and it is estimated that COVID-19 pandemic triggers 25% increase in prevalence of anxiety and depression worldwide [11]. As new measures imposed in many countries such as self-isolation and quarantine, which affects day-to-day activities, routines, and livelihoods of people, they may lead to an increase in loneliness, anxiety, depression, insomnia, harmful alcohol and drug use, and self-harm or suicidal behaviour [12]. There is substantial evidence to demonstrate the deterioration of mental health among people during and after the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the pre-COVID-19 period [13\u201316]. Stack and Rockett (2021) discovered an increased suicide rate during the Spanish flu epidemic in 43 large cities, which was connected to the degree of social distancing, independent of the influenza fatality rate [17]. According to WHO, Every year more than 700,000 people die due to suicide [18]. However, there was no consistent evidence of a rise in suicide during and post-COVID era [19]. In this context, the research evidence on the effect of COVID-19 on suicides and suicidal attempts began to expand very rapidly. It is, therefore, timely and important to collate the global evidence on the incidence of suicide/suicidal attempts and the trend in suicidal rates during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, this study aimed to systematically review the available literature on (i) the incidence of suicidal attempts, suicidal deaths, and the trends in suicidal rates during the COVID-19 pandemic (ii) the risk factors for suicidal attempts and suicidal deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic, and (iii) the recommendations in preventing suicidal attempts or suicidal deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic."

An increasing trend of suicidal deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic was found in 16.7% (n = 3), while decreased in 5.6% (n = 1) studies. 16.7% (n = 3) of studies reported no increased or decreased trends in suicidal deaths. Finally, 5.6% (n = 1) of studies reported decreased trends during the crisis but increased after the immediate crisis had passed (Table\u00a02).\nRisk factors associated with\u00a0suicide/suicidal attempts during\u00a0COVID\u201119 pandemic Out of 18 studies included in this systematic review, only six studies [22, 23, 27, 30, 33, 39] provided data on associated factors for suicide and/or suicidal attempts during the COVID-19 pandemic. The mental health impact of social distancing was reported as an associated factor by Ammerman et\u00a0 al., 2021, while COVID-19 quarantine was mentioned as an associated factor identified by Daly et\u00a0al., 2021. Three studies [23, 27, 39] reported that\nfinancial crises due to loss of employment are associated with suicide and/or suicidal attempts during COVID-19. Table\u00a03 shows the reported associated factors of suicide/ suicide attempts during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRecommendations for\u00a0prevention of\u00a0suicide/ suicidal attempts during\u00a0the\u00a0COVID\u201119 pandemic Recommendations for preventing suicide/suicide attempts were provided in nine studies [23, 25, 27, 28, 30, 31, 33, 35, 37]. Of them, we have identified common thematic recommendations for preventing suicidal deaths and suicidal attempts, and those were; 1) Develop a systematic suicide screening process and increase the suicide risk screening [23, 25, 28, 30, 37]. 2) Facilitate communication and increase access to the interventions for the people at risk [30, 35], 3) Design, develop, and provide interventions for mental health and psychological well-being for the people at risk (including mental health awareness programs, promoting social connectedness) [23, 30, 31, 33, 35, 37] 4) Implement measures to mitigate the impact on the economy (e.g., Provision of economic supports and changes in payment policies) [35, 37], and 5) Regulation of media reporting [27, 37]. The study done by Nomura et\u00a0 al., 2021 in Japan revealed an increased rate of suicide among women. Therefore, they recommended feasible ways of strengthening the financial condition of women by providing direct income support, cut down of tax, postponement or exemption of social security payments for temporary workers, support for women\u2019s income security to end the gender pay gaps and regulations to correct the under-valuation of women\u2019s work, and provision of paid leave and flexible working arrangements [27].

One potential option to facilitate large-scale risk detection is to incorporate suicide risk screenings into the protocol at COVID-19 testing sites, as the routine screenings are not possible due to the social distancing and stay-at-home regulations. This may be accomplished by including one- or two-question screener that would result in a follow-up phone call to facilitate care linkage if a suicide risk is recognized [30]. Recommendations for preventing suicide/suicidal attempts during the COVID-19 pandemic suggested by individual studies are shown in Table\u00a04."

More than 80% of the studies have not measured the exposure before outcomes and adjusted for confounding variables. More than 40% of studies measured the exposure more than once over a time. Lastly, there were five criteria (36%) that we could not determine the quality or not applicable to assess the particular criteria in almost all the studies. Those criteria were; over \u2265 50% participation rate of the eligible person, having a justified sample size, having a different level of exposures as related to the outcomes examined, having\nblinded assessors of outcome/ s to the exposure status, and having a \u2264 20 follow-up from baseline (Fig.\u00a02)."

            "text": "This systematic review presents several vital factors based on more than 12,746 suicidal attempts and 33,345 suicidal deaths reported during the COVID-19 pandemic. Suicidal death is a preventable loss that disturbs families, communities, and countries. Globally, it is a significant public health problem, and more than 700 000 people die due to suicide every year [40]. The present review found that the majority of the studies reported an increasing trend of suicidal attempts during the COVID 19 pandemic compared to the rates reported before the pandemic. Nevertheless, a review done in 2020 to find the suicidal behaviors and ideation during emerging viral disease outbreaks before the COVID-19 pandemic found weak evidence to suggest a significant increase in suicidal attempts and deaths by suicide during emerging viral disease outbreaks [41]. Compared to the global past pandemics, COVID 19 has tricky and complex mechanisms that have facilitated its rapid and catastrophic spread worldwide [42]. It is considered the most severe pandemic of the twenty-first century [43]. The rise in community distress due to the unexpected spread and rise of covid-19 virus has led to a pandemic status, eventually may have caused for the increasing trend of suicidal attempts reported during the COVID 19 pandemic compared to similar pandemics the world experienced before.\nAccording to the WHO, a prior suicide attempt in normal circumstances is considered the most critical risk factor for suicide in the general population. However, the present systematic review reported domestic conflicts and violence, financial loss/job loss, anxiety and depression, and pre-existing mental health condition/s were there among the identified risk factors for suicidal attempts and suicidal deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe social restriction practices and policies imposed by different countries secondary to the COVID 19 pandemic might have negatively influenced the fore-said risk factors that has been indirectly led increased rates of suicidal attempts and deaths. Moreover, in the wake of COVID 19, millions of people lost their access to employment and experienced financial hardships in day-to-day life [44]. It was evident that financial/employment-related issues substantially contribute to 13% of suicide deaths [45]. On the other hand, job loss or financial hardships independently lead to significant and persistent increases in domestic violence [46]. Similarly, social isolation and stay-at-home rules imposed by many counties badly resulted in domestic violence, making survivors of domestic violence at risk for further violence and\nAmmerman et al., 2021 [30] General distress Physical safety concerns Mental health impact of social distancing\nBergmans and Larson 2021 [22] Male sex Aged group of 18\u201365 years Having a history of three or more encounters of suicide attempt or intentional self-harm Unmarried\nChoudhury, 2020 [23] Financial losses/job loss Domestic conflicts & violence Poverty and hunger Anxiety and depression\nDaly et al., 2021 [33] COVID-19 quarantine Pre-existing mental health condition/s\nNomura et al., 2021 [27] Gender-based violence Loss of employment\nShrestha et al., 2021 [39] Disputes with family members Economic crisis\nisolating them from networks of support [47]. Furthermore, it is evident that during pandemics, a considerable number of people present with anxiety and depressive symptoms though they do not have any pre-existing mental health conditions [8]. As a result of this, some experience post-traumatic stress disorders in due course of their lives, which can end up with suicidal attempts or deaths. Nonetheless, a delayed increase in suicide rates is possible following major disasters [48\u201350]. Therefore, preventing suicidal attempts and deaths in the context of COVID 19 is a critical public health priority.\nConsidering the importance of preventing suicidal attempts and deaths secondary to the COVID 19 pandemic, early detection and timely intervention for individuals with suicidal behaviors is crucial [51]. Unlike previous pandemics, COVID-19 is occurring in the modern digital world, where video conferencing and virtual healthcare provision are widely available [52]. Although some people experience suicidal ideas during this\npandemic, they might not attempt to seek help because of fear that meeting a health care professional face-toface might put them at risk of contacting COVID-19. In this regard, as several studies have already identified the positive effects of new technologies in combating and preventing suicidal behavior, virtual platforms can be used as an effective way of screening to identify the people those at risk at the early stages [51, 53]. To strengthen this approach, community-based training programs can be used periodically to approach the neediest people early. Moreover, media should also be responsible when reporting facts, avoiding stoking fear and hopelessness among people in the community [18]. Therefore, it is recommended to use the recommendations given by this review to prevent suicidal attempts or suicidal deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThere are a few limitations in this review. The findings of this review can be limited because of not including the potential articles beyond the search"

Besides, the studies included in this review used different durations for data collection during the COVID 19 pandemic making it difficult to estimate the incidence rate of suicidal attempts and deaths only for the COVID 19 pandemic. Moreover, the inter-rater agreement was not calculated for this review as the screening process was undertaken in Covidence systematic review manager software. Despite these limitations, this review provides; (i) the first observation of suicidal attempts and suicidal deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic, (ii) the risk factors for suicidal attempts and suicidal deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic, and (iii) the recommendations in preventing suicidal attempts or suicidal deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic. Suicide prevention in the COVID-19 era and similar pandemics are crucial and challenging. Therefore, it is essential to select appropriate suicide prevention strategies based on strong evidence. The findings of this study can be used when selecting appropriate suicide prevention strategies considering the identified risk factors and recommendations given. It is recommended to discuss the longitudinal trends in future studies."
