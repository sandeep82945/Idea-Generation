The aim of this open survey was (i) to assess the prevalence and identify causing factors of hand issues encountered by hairdressers and (ii) to assess the benefit of a cosmetic skin care in clinical signs and symptoms through a clinical observational survey. Methods: The survey was conducted among 391 hairdressers and hairdresser-related professionals, collecting information on frequency of daily procedures, frequency/type/severity of hand issues, and glove usage. The satisfaction provided by a dermocosmetic containing niacinamide, glycerin, shea butter and thermal spring water was examined in an evaluation visit one month after survey initiation. Results: Investigated subjects were mostly hairdressers (73%). In their daily procedures, a majority (\u226576%) always or often used shampoos, hair dyes, oxidants, bleachers, straighteners and perms. Overall, a majority (>60%) of subjects always or often had hand irritation due to this use (except for straighteners). Most subjects (\u226560%) reported using gloves in their procedures except with shampoos and straighteners. Among hand problems reported at survey initiation, the most intense was skin dryness, followed by redness, irritation, cracks, and fissures. Hand problems induced annoyance in their activities for most subjects (>65%), leading to discontinuation of their professional activities for 28% subjects. The test dermocosmetic was applied for 1 week up to 1 month. At evaluation visit (1 month), the intensity of all hand signs and symptoms was decreased compared to initiation visit. In addition, 58.3% subjects reported return to professional activities instantly at evaluation visit versus 31.3% at initial visit. Most subjects (\u226573%) were satisfied or very satisfied with the test cream properties. Conclusion: Our survey confirms the impact of hand issues experienced by hairdresser professionals and highlights the need for gloves and for efficient hand care products.",

            "text": "Hand eczema is an inflammatory skin condition that may be chronic in some patients, and its socioeconomic burden including societal costs, healthcare resource utilization, missed work time and job loss is considerable.1 A systematic review was performed to assess the association between occupations and incidence rate of hand eczema: the study found that hairdressers, nurses and metal workers had a high incidence of hand eczema.2 Indeed, hand eczema is frequent among hairdressers because of intense contacts with water and daily exposure to irritants and allergens. A systematic review of epidemiological studies published from 2000 to 2021 shows that the lifetime prevalence of hand eczema within hairdressers is up to 38.2%,3 while a recently published review estimated the lifetime prevalence of hand eczema in the general population at 14.5%,4 illustrating the increased risk of hairdressers to develop hand eczema.5,6\nClinical, Cosmetic and Investigational Dermatology 2023:16 111\u2013117 111 \u00a9 2023 Seit\u00e9 et al.

Before answering the questionnaire, each respondent was informed of the nature of the survey, that their anonymity would be respected, and that collected information would not allow identification. Each respondent had to confirm in writing his or her agreement and non-opposition to answer the questionnaire. This operational survey was conducted between September and November 2019 and adhered to the principles of Good Clinical Practices and the declaration of Helsinki.

Among the investigated subjects, a majority (73.4%) were hairdressers, 13% had other functions such as colorists, nail technicians, beauticians, receptionists or sales representatives; 8.7% were managers or proprietors, and 4.9% were assistants or apprentices. The time spent in their respective functions was (mean\u00b1SD) 11.9\u00b18.6 years (N = 328).\nEpidemiological Data: Daily Procedures, Frequency and Type of Hand Issues, Usage of Gloves The frequency of daily procedures was analyzed at initiation visit. Frequencies of associated hand irritations and of the usage of gloves were quantified (Table 1).\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/CCID.S385681 DovePress Clinical, Cosmetic and Investigational Dermatology 2023:16 112\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nShampoos If almost all (94.8%) subjects always or often used shampoos in their daily procedures, 65.8% always or often experienced hand irritation due to this use, and only 29.9% of them used gloves when applying shampoos.\nHair Dyes A vast majority (96.1%) of subjects always or often used hair dyes, among which 65.2% always or often had hand irritation due to this use, despite widespread usage of gloves (84.6%).\nOxidants 90.4% subjects always or often used oxidants, among which 65.4% always or often experienced hand irritation due to this use, despite the usage of gloves for most of them (84%).\nBleachers 90.3% subjects always or often used bleachers, among which 71.2% always or often had hand irritation due to this use, despite the usage of gloves for most of them (83.8%).\nStraighteners 85.1% subjects always or often used straighteners, among which 46.1% always or often had hand irritation due to this use, and only 47.4% of them used gloves during application.\nPerms 75.6% of subjects always or often used perms, among which 64.3% always or often had hand irritation due to this use, despite the usage of gloves for most of them (60.3%).\nTime Spent with Hands in Contact with Water The time spent with hands in contact with water every day was more than 3 h for almost half of the subjects (46.6%), 1 to 3 h for 33.8%, 30 min to 1 h for 13.4%, and less than 30 min for 6.2% subjects.\nHand Problem Severity Among hand problems described at initiation visit using a 0 (none) to 10 (very strong) intensity scale, \u201cstrong to very strong\u201d skin signs and symptoms (intensity scores \u22658) were reported by 32.3% subjects for dryness (Table 2), 20.4% subjects for redness (Table 3), 21.6% subjects for irritation (Table 4), 22.9% for cracks (Table 5), and 10.7% subjects for\nAbbreviation: N, number of subjects.\nClinical, Cosmetic and Investigational Dermatology 2023:16 https://doi.org/10.2147/CCID.S385681 DovePress\n113\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nfissures (Table 6). Conversely, \u201cno to very light\u201d skin signs and symptoms (intensity scores 0 to 1) were reported essentially for fissures (42.5% subjects, Table 6); these percentages decreased to 25.2% for cracks (Table 5), 18.2% for irritation (Table 4), 14.2% for redness (Table 3) and only 9.3% for dryness (Table 2).\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/CCID.S385681 DovePress Clinical, Cosmetic and Investigational Dermatology 2023:16 114\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nThese hand problems induced annoyance in their activities for most subjects (always for 20.7%, sometimes for 45.5%). Even 28% subjects reported discontinuation of their professional activities due to the hand issues (data collected in Poland, Slovenia and Croatia), in line with the observation of missed work time (up to 57% subjects taking sick leave) reported by Armstrong et al in their review of the economic burden of hand eczema.1\nClinical, Cosmetic and Investigational Dermatology 2023:16 https://doi.org/10.2147/CCID.S385681 DovePress\n115\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nClinical Observational Survey Results: Efficacy and Satisfaction Provided by a Dermocosmetic Cream A hand cream was reported to be used at least from time to time by 96% subjects, among which only 62.8% declared being satisfied or very satisfied by this use. This underlines the need for a more frequent use of suitable hand products with good cosmetic acceptability.\nThe efficacy and satisfaction of the niacinamide/glycerin/shea butter/thermal spring water test cream was examined after up to 1 month of application (evaluation visit). More than 90% of subjects had applied the product at least for 1 week (24.4% for 1\u20132 weeks, 25.7% for 2\u20133 weeks, 20.4% for 3\u20134 weeks, and 20.2% for 4 weeks). Overall, the subjects reported an improvement of all hand signs and symptoms (dryness, redness, irritations, cracks, fissures) compared to the initiation visit.\nThe time needed to resume professional activities after applying the test dermocosmetic was compared to that reported at initiation visit. Of note, almost twice as many subjects reported return to professional activities instantly at evaluation visit compared to initial visit (58.3% versus 31.3%, respectively).\nFor 79.4% subjects, the application of the test dermocosmetic allowed wearing the gloves comfortably. A large majority of the subjects (90.1%) would recommend this product to other colleagues. Most subjects were satisfied or very satisfied by the texture (74.1%), absorption time (73.8%), efficacy (79.7%), and long lasting effect (72.9%). Almost half of the subjects (49.6%) were more satisfied with the test dermocosmetic product compared to their usual products."

We acknowledge that it is possible that professionals perform several activities at the same time, so it is difficult to discriminate which of these activities (shampoos, hair dyes, oxidizers, bleaches, straighteners) are responsible for the onset of eczema.\nSurprisingly, hand irritation remains very frequent despite widespread usage of gloves in most procedures except for shampoos and straighteners. In this respect, it is noteworthy that as many as 66% subjects reported hand irritation when\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/CCID.S385681 DovePress Clinical, Cosmetic and Investigational Dermatology 2023:16 116\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\napplying shampoos whereas only 30% said wearing gloves in this procedure. Therefore, this survey clearly highlights the need for prevention of hand eczema, by inciting for an extensive usage of gloves in all procedures and, because this usage does not fully prevent from hand issues, by encouraging the use of hand care products \u2013 including in a preventive way \u2013 to minimize and/or improve the impact of hand problems on hairdressers\u2019 health and professional activities.\nResults from this survey after up to 1 month application of a dermocosmetic containing niacinamide, glycerin, shea butter and thermal spring water show a good efficacy and acceptance of the product, along with an excellent satisfaction in its use by hairdresser professionals. These findings further support the interest of suitable hand care products in the prevention and treatment of hand issues.\nDirections for future will mainly focus on the conduct of prevention campaigns in line with the above mentioned statements on the clear need for preventive measures."
