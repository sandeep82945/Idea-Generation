    "abstractText": "The basic concern of the Capitalistic approach of manufacturing industry is to minimize costs and to maximize profit. Through uncontrolled rate of exploitation, the manufacturer creates large quanta of social surplus. This ultimately results in the economic injustice and inequality among social economic classes. This current article makes an initiation to develop an economic production quantity model with deterioration under Marxian approach of sociopolitical economy. Here, two Marxian economic production quantity models are developed aiming at the minimization of exploitation rate and reduction of social surplus. The notion of marginal profit is considered here to reduce the social surplus (Net profit) incurred in the production plant itself. Fuzzy system has also been studied to get the variability of the exploitation in the model. Sensitivity analysis, graphical illustrations are made to validate the model.",

            "text": "The inventory control problems are much celebrated optimization problems in the domain of operation research. In this context, economic order quantity (EOQ) model and economic production quantity (EPQ) model are two popular lot-sizing approaches among the inventory management technologies. Here, optimal order/production quantity (lot size) is the matter of concern, aiming at the minimization of cost or maximization of the profit. Initially, the literature was grown with the simple assumptions of constant demand and production rate etc. Gradually, the literature of the lot-sizing modelling was improved and matured incorporating more reliable assumptions serving different purposes [1, 2]. In reality, the demand and pricing are a very crucial factor in any retailing business model. The demand rate may vary with respect to time [3, 4], stock level [5], selling price [6], various dealing policy and so many other components in different supply situations. The deterioration or decay of items in inventory is also a very practical concern closely associated with the modelling which was considered by Ghare and Schrader [7] for the first time. Again, the deterioration rate may not be constant always in reality. The deterioration rate in terms of the two & Ali Ahmadian ali.ahmadian@ukm.edu.my Mostafijur Rahaman imostafijurrahaman@gmail.com Sankar Prasad Mondal sankar.res07@gmail.com Shariful Alam salam50in@yahoo.co.in Sujit Kumar De skdemamo2008.com@gmail.com 1 Department of Mathematics, Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, Shibpur 711103, Howrah, India 2 Department of Applied Science, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University of Technology, Kolkata 741249, West Bengal, India 3 Department of Mathematics, Midnapore College (Autonomous), Paschim Midnapore 721101, West Bengal, India 4 Intitute of IR 4.0, The National University of Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia 5 Department of Mathematics, Near East University, Nicosia, TRNC, Mersin 10, Turkey\nparameter Weibull distribution was considered by Emmons [8]. Till now, several investigations [9\u201319] were engaged to develop inventory models with deterioration of items. Very recently, the constant rates of deterioration are considered to manifest the memory-based investigations of the EPQ models by Rahaman et al. [20, 21].\nIn reality, the parameters and decision variables carry uncertainty in their value which create uncertain environment of decision-making. Fuzzy logic is one of the finest tools to define uncertainty involved in the process of decision-making. The concept of fuzzy uncertainty was given by Zadeh [22]. Subsequently, Bellman and Zadeh [23] considered the fuzzy logic for decision-making problems. Till date, many investigations [24\u201332] have explored the intuitive meanings of fuzziness and the potential applications of fuzzy sense in the fields of technology and management. The concept of learning experience-based uncertainty decision-making problem was introduced through the establishment of triangular dense fuzzy sets (TDFS) by De and Beg [33]. One of the extensions of TDFS through considering continuous time variable, namely cloudy fuzzy set was developed by De and Mahata [34]. De [35] also extended the concept of triangular dense fuzzy set to the triangular dense fuzzy lock set (TDFLS). The optimization of inventory control problem is one kind of decision-making problems where data regarding various parameters are ambiguous in nature. This motivates the study of inventory control problem in an uncertainty phenomenon described by fuzzy sets. In this context, some studies [36\u201339] on the inventory control problems have been carried out utilizing the concepts of TDFS, TDFLS and cloudy fuzzy set.\nAgain, the Marxian economics is a revolutionary approach against classical political economics. The radical idea of this socio-political economy containing the analysis on the crisis of capitalism, the surplus product and surplus value was innovated by Marx and Engels [40, 41]. The social surplus is beehive of the Capitalistic economy. It is defined to be a measure of wealth value and product over and above the necessity of a social system to its productivity. The social surplus in the form of net profit is expected to be exponential in a Capitalistic society in the favor of the Bourgeoisie (Capitalist). The social surpluses are gathered in the hand of Bourgeoisie through the exploitation to the proletariat (worker) which ultimately creates discrimination and injustice in society. In reality, the existence of social surplus and exploitation has ancient tradition in the history of mankind. From that moment when the human civilization emerged out of hunting and gathering stage of social surplus was the source of net wealth. The royal family life style of many ancient civilizations proves the existence of exploitation and social surplus in those days\u2019 society. However, the Capitalistic\nidea of productivity is much organized trap to make exponential growth of the surplus value with huge exploitation. Against the Capitalism, Marx\u2019s advocacy of revolutionary socialism was experimented in many countries like Soviet Union, China, Vietnam Cuba etc. Many studies and investigations on Marxian economics [42\u201354] enriched the literature as well. However, the Marxian economy faced a huge challenge from the Capitalistic world and seems to be dominated in modern era.\nAfter brief reviewing of literature the following shortcomings in the existing literature can be pointed out and those are tried to be overcome in the current article:\n(i) The existing approaches of describing the inven-\ntory control problems worried only on the cost minimization and profit maximization. The traditional strategy is not interested to bother about the exploitation and discrimination in society.\n(ii) The Marxian approach of socio-political economy\nmade great enthusiasm initially. However, it seems to be dominated by the growing establishment of Capitalistic economy.\n(iii) This current article makes an initiation to develop\nan economic production quantity (EPQ) model inspired by the Marxian view of socio-political economics. Here, the minimization of exploitation rate is included as an objective along with cost minimization and profit maximization. Also, total profit is restricted to be little part of the total cost. The EPQ model with marginal profit and exploitation is termed as the Marxian economic order quantity (MEPQ) model in this paper.\nThe rest of the article is organized as the following: The Sect. 2 gives a very short description on the fuzzy numbers used in this article and fundamental Marxian Theorem. The notations and assumptions to describe the proposed models are presented in the Sect. 3. The Sect. 4 formulates the mathematical models based on the assumptions. The fuzzification of one of the models described in the Sect. 4 is made in the Sect. 5. The Sect. 6 represents a comparison numerically among various models. The sensitivity analysis of the fuzzy model is done in the Sect. 7. The graphical analysis is presented in the Sect. 8. Finally, the conclusion over the current study is made in Sect. 9."

This includes the unpaid labour power to produce the commodities.

Instead of being an input parameter, here, sp is regarded as the decision variable.\n(d) Fuzzy MEPQ model with normal profit: The fuzzy\nversion of the MEPQ model with normal profit is illustrated numerically considering the following values of the centers of the fuzzy parameters:\nsp0 \u00bc 45, sc0 \u00bc 500, pc0 \u00bc 28, hc0 \u00bc 2:5, dc0 \u00bc 1:5,v0 \u00bc 0:5,D0 \u00bc 1000, K0 \u00bc 1400.\nAlso, the deviation (range) of the fuzzy variables and parameters are taken asr0 \u00bc 0:3 and qk \u00bc 0:2 (for k \u00bc 1; 2; . . .; 7), where r0 and qk(for k \u00bc 1; 2; . . .; 7) are referred by the Eq.

From the comparison in the table, it is perceived that only the addition of exploitation rate as an objective function to be minimized, does not contribute to any significant change of the situation of costs, profit and deprivation if the remaining setup is maintained just like the traditional EOQ model. Because, the Crisp EPQ and MEPQ models with normal profit show the same numerical outputs in Table 1. In the next step of the numerical simulation, we are looking for an alternative business policy under the marginal profit. The selling price is restricted to be bound, aiming at a very marginal\ncomponent of cost as the net profit. And it is seen in Table 1 that the MEPQ model with marginal profit can successfully handle the objective of minimization of social surplus as well as the exploitation. On the other hand, the fuzzy MEPQ model with normal profit gives a huge quantum of profit through even more exploitation rate than the crisp MEPQ model with normal profit. This shows that uncertainties involved in the parameters make more and more gathering of social surplus. In the sense of profit maximization objective of manufacturer\u2019s side, the fuzzy modeling is the best among the four modeling. However, in the Marxian view on socio-political economy MEPQ model with marginal profit gives the best perspective."

The percentage of changes of the total profit with respect to the percentage of changes in the individual inputs is considered as the measurement of the sensitivity of the optimal solution against the corresponding input parameters.\nThe following observations and explanations are made\nfrom Table 2:\n(i) The changes in the value of deviation of fuzziness\nof the variable sp do not contribute directly in the changes of exploitation and net profit as per expectation. It is seen that by increasing r0 for 50% of its value, the values of R and P change with negative impact. Again, decreasing r0 for 50% of its value, though the exploitation rate can be decreased but the net profit is increased with a\nhuge amount. The explanation is that whenever the values of r0 change, it makes a new adjustment in the values of production time and total cycle time. Thus, the rate of exploitation and the net profit changes accordingly.\n(ii) Decreasing the values of the deviation q1 of fuzziness of the parameter sc i.e., actually increas-\ning the value of sc, the exploitation can be\ndecreased as expected. The net profit also follows the rule accordingly with an exception 50% value of q1. In this case, the value of the net profit is increased due to the bigger values of the production time and the total cycle time.\n(iii) The changes in the value of deviation of fuzziness\nof the variable pc give the similar results as sp.That is, here also the values of the production\nTable 2 Sensitivity of the optimal solution with respect to fuzzy and non-fuzzy parameters\nParameters % Change\nin input parameters\nT 1 (Weeks) T (Weeks) Q (Units) R (%) Y ($) Z ($) a P \u00bc Y Z P P\nP 100%\nr0(Deviation of the fuzzy\nselling price)\n? 50 0.715 1.000 998.00 54.17 45,112.10 29,261.55 0.99 15,850.55 - 58.97\n? 25 1.431 2.000 1920.00 70.72 92,880.00 54,403.45 0.8 38,476.55 - 0.40\n- 25 1.431 2.000 1920.00 65.96 90,288.00 54,403.45 0.8 35,884.55 - 7.11\n- 50 3.357 4.685 4403.45 64.67 207,072.10 125,747.40 0.7 81,324.70 110.51\nq1(Deviation of the fuzzy set\nup cost)\n? 50 1.431 2.000 1880.00 79.81 92,214.00 52,155.05 0.7 40,058.95 3.69\n? 25 1.431 2.000 1900.00 72.53 91,912.50 53,274.65 0.75 38,637.85 0.02\n- 25 1.431 2.000 1900.00 72.49 91,912.50 53,287.15 0.75 38,625.35 - 0.02\n- 50 2.179 3.045 2983.77 58.61 138,297.80 87,191.58 0.9 51,106.22 32.29\nq2(Deviation of the fuzzy\nproduction cost)\n? 50 3.650 5.092 4989.87 56.44 231,280.30 147,837.40 0.9 83,442.90 116.00\n? 25 1.431 2.000 1860.00 84.39 92,488.50 50,158.20 0.65 42,330.30 9.57\n- 25 1.431 2.000 1900.00 70.38 91,912.50 53,946.85 0.75 37,965.65 - 1.72\n- 50 3.376 4.711 4334.27 73.29 218,447.30 126,056.4 0.6 92,390.90 139.16\nq3(Deviation of the fuzzy\nholding cost)\n? 50 1.431 2.000 1880.00 76.89 92,214.00 52,129.82 0.7 40,084.18 3.76\n? 25 1.431 2.000 1840.00 85.63 92,736.00 49,957.20 0.6 42,778.80 10.74\n- 25 1.431 2.000 1840.00 85.44 92,736.00 50,009.70 0.6 42,726.30 10.60\n- 50 1.431 2.000 1840.00 85.34 92,736.00 50,035.95 0.6 42,700.05 10.53\nq4(Deviation of the fuzzy\ndeterioration cost)\n? 50 1.431 2.000 1880.00 76.76 92,214.00 52,169.93 0.7 40,044.07 3.66\n? 25 1.431 2.000 1900.00 72.51 91,912.50 53,280.85 0.75 38,631.65 0.00\n- 25 1.431 2.000 1840.00 85.53 92,736.00 49,983.53 0.6 42,752.47 10.67\n- 50 1.431 2.000 1840.00 85.53 92,736.00 49,983.61 0.6 42,752.39 10.67\nq5(Deviation of the fuzzy\nlabour cost)\n? 50 1.431 2.000 1900.00 72.58 91,912.50 53,257.15 0.75 38,655.35 0.06\n? 25 1.431 2.000 1880.00 76.80 92,214.00 52,155.95 0.7 40,058.05 3.69\n- 25 1.431 2.000 1880.00 76.71 92,214.00 52,184.15 0.7 40,029.85 3.62\n- 50 7.208 10.020 9318.75 65.36 463,375.00 280,228.8 0.65 183,146.20 374.08\nq6(Deviation of the fuzzy\nproduction rate)\n? 50 1.377 2.000 1790.00 80.60 89,007.75 49,284.93 0.65 39,722.82 2.82\n? 25 1.515 2.151 1990.11 76.31 97,615.07 55,365.71 0.7 42,249.36 9.36\n- 25 1.453 2.000 1910.00 76.96 93,685.50 52,940.85 0.7 40,744.65 5.47\n- 50 1.484 2.000 1930.00 81.60 95,969.28 52,847.54 0.65 43,121.74 11.62\nq7(Deviation of the fuzzy\ndemand rate)\n? 50 1.495 2.000 1840.00 86.07 92,736.01 49,838.04 0.6 42,897.97 11.04\n? 25 1.462 2.000 1840.00 85.80 92,735.97 49,912.32 0.6 42,823.65 10.33\n- 25 1.400 2.000 1840.00 85.28 92,736.00 50,051.60 0.6 42,684.40 10.49\n- 50 1.371 2.000 1840.00 85.04 92,736.00 50,116.93 0.6 42,619.07 10.32\n/(Crisp rate of deterioration) ? 50 1.432 2.000 1996.00 93.17 90,089.46 58,816.69 0.99 31,272.77 - 19.05\n? 25 1.431 2.000 1920.00 68.28 91,584.00 54,422.34 0.8 37,161.66 - 3.80\n- 25 3.587 3.587 3299.93 82.68 166,316.50 91,037.59 0.6 75,278.91 94.86\n- 50 1.430 2.000 1840.00 85.66 92,736.00 49,948.72 0.6 42,787.28 10.76\ntime and total cycle time change according to the values of q2 and thus the changes in the values of exploitation and net profit do not follow the expectation.\n(iv) The changes in the value of deviation of fuzziness\nof the variable hc and v give almost the similar results as sc.\n(v) The changes in the value of deviation of fuzziness\nof the variable dc and D give different results for\ndifferent level of aspiration a.

            "text": "Here, we draw several graphs based on the numerical data obtained in Tables 1 and 2. In Fig. 2, the crisp EPQ and MEPQ models with normal profit represent the same total profit. The fuzzy MEPQ models with normal profit assure for the best result for the Capitalistic point of view, while the MEPQ model with marginal profit gives the best result for the Marxian point of view.\nFig. 3 represents a two-dimensional plotting of total profit against the exploitation rate. The curve in Fig. 3 has several ups and downs in its progression. The highest peak of the total profit corresponds for the exploitation rate of 65:36%. The non-uniform progress of the curve shows the dependency of the total profit on the other parameters and decision variables.\nThe graphical version of the sensitivity analysis presented by Table 2 is given by Figs. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12.\nFigure 4 shows the variation of profit value with respect to the variation of fuzzy deviation parameter of unit selling price. It indicates that the increase of fuzzy deviation parameter causes the decrease of profit value but profit value may assume zero around the zero change of that parameter exclusively. Figure 5 indicates the profit variation with respect to the changes of the setup cost. For low set up cost, profit is maximum but for higher set up cost, the profit value kept a bound.\nFigure 6 describes the variation of profit value with respect to the % changes of unit production cost. It shows that, within the change 25% to \u00fe25%, the profit is minimum, but beyond that it began to increase. Figure 7 reveals the profit variation due to the changes of unit holding cost. It is seen that, from 50% to 25% change, the profit function is kept to be constant value near $43000, but at no change, the profit began to decrease. Then, it\nbegan to increase up to \u00fe25% change and becomes lower value for further changes.\nFigure 8 describes \u2018\u2018Z\u2019\u2019 type curve with respect to the changes of the unit deterioration cost showing the profit range $ 38500 43000\u00f0 \u00de. Figure 9 indicates a \u2018\u2018L\u2019\u2019 type curve due to the changes of the total labor cost giving the profit range $ 30000 180000\u00f0 \u00de. Figure 10 discusses the profit variation of the Marxian EPQ model due to the change of fuzzy deviation parameter of demand rate, describing a monotonic decreasing at 0% change then increasing at ? 25% change and finally decreasing for further changes keeping profit range $ 38000 43500\u00f0 \u00de. Figure 11 explores the profit variation due to production rate and it gives a \u2018\u2018V\u2019\u2019 shaped curve around no change performed.\nFigure 12 depicts the profit variation of the Marxian EPQ model due to the changes of the deterioration rate. The curve is increasing from 50% to 25%. Then it begins to decrease for further changes keeping the profit range $ 28000 73000\u00f0 \u00de. Fig. 13 gives a three-dimensional surface on the interdependency among the total profit, lot size and cycle time of the MEPQ model. On the other hand, Fig. 14 represents the surface response for the total profit function with respect to the variation of rate of exploitation and unit selling price exclusively."

            "heading": "10 Conclusion",
            "text": "In this current article, an economic production quantity model of deteriorated items has been experimented in different economic policies and phenomena. Traditional EPQ model has been viewed in the light of the Marxian socio-political economics. Initially, the crisp EPQ model is modified through introducing an additional objective of exploitation reduction under normal profit scenario. It is seen that, the MEPQ model with normal profit does not bring any changes in the whole economic situation as the outcomes coincides with that of the traditional EPQ model. Later, the MEPQ model with normal profit is further modified in two different ways. Firstly, the normal profit scheme is replaced by the notion of marginal profit and the model is renamed as the MEPQ model with marginal profit. Here, a small share of the total cost is expected to be ultimate profit. And it is established from the numerical simulation, the MEPQ model with marginal profit can fulfill the purpose of reducing the social surplus accordingly the Marxian point of view. The MEPQ model with normal profit is also viewed in the uncertain environment by fuzzy decision-making setup. The fuzzy consideration is seemed to be favored for the goal of the Bourgeoisie. The manufactures can manipulate the uncertainty in their interest to earn more social surplus even larger quanta\ncompared to that of the crisp case. So, fuzzy MEPQ model with normal profit stands just opposite to the Marxian view. Traditionally, the cost minimization and profit maximization are the celebrated objectives to the manufacturer. So, a decision maker has to fix his/her goal on increasing profit.\nBut, the purely Capitalistic approach in profit maximization is resulting the high exploitation and deprivation of the peoples of working class as well as middle class people. Though this policy contributes a huge surplus in the manufactures\u2019 hand but it may create negative reaction\nfrom exploited section. There may be caused unrest, struggle for revolution which ultimately hampers the productivity. Therefore, the MEPQ model with marginal profit can be an effective model in this regard. However, the\nCapitalistic approach of the economic system dominates the current era of the economic activity throughout the whole world. So, we cannot neglect the objectivity of the Bourgeoisie society. In this article, we have shown the both\nsides of the coin manifesting two different models in favor of both the Marxian and Capitalistic aspirations.\nThe present study can claim its novelties in the below mentioned grounds: Firstly, up to the authors\u2019 knowing, Marxian philosophy is experimented in the discussion of a lot-sizing problem for first time in literature. Secondly, the mathematical foundation of the manufacturing inventory model having multi-valued objective function has been studied here within in a single objective function. Thirdly, a model is developed on manpower exploitation in production farm keeping a new direction of modern research.\nHowever, the authors admit their limitations for developing a fully theoretical and hypothetical studies. So, the notion of alternative policy of lot-sizing management introduced here has to be modified with real data and business problem in future. Again, the whole world is going through a pandemic due to COVID-19 and global economy is going through very difficult time. At least for this hard time, the manufacturers can reduce the exploitation rate and earning of social surplus maintaining the principal of marginal profit. Then, the consumers and the working class with very low income can survive and the production-supply consumption cycle run as well. In this context, some modifications on the MEPQ model with marginal profit introduced here can be a fruitful mathematical aid.\nDeclarations\nConflict of interest The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding publication of this article."
