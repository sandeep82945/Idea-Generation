Cross-Algorithm Comparison and Hybrid Models: Further research could focus on comparing a broader range of optimization algorithms beyond ACO and PSO, including newer or less conventional algorithms like deep learning-based optimization. A study could also explore hybrid models that combine the strengths of multiple algorithms to achieve even more efficient load management and cost reduction in EToU schemes.

Sector-Specific DSM Strategies: The paper highlights the effectiveness of DSM strategies in industrial settings. Future research could tailor DSM strategies to specific sectors, such as healthcare, retail, or education, to understand how different industries can maximize benefits from EToU tariffs. This could involve sector-specific load management strategies and optimizations that cater to the unique energy usage patterns and operational requirements of each sector.

Integration with Renewable Energy Sources: Integrating DSM strategies with renewable energy sources (RES) like solar and wind could be a promising area of research. This could involve studying how to optimize energy consumption and reduce costs by leveraging EToU tariffs in conjunction with energy generated from RES, considering the variability and unpredictability of RES.

Real-time DSM and IoT Applications: Investigating the potential of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and real-time data analytics to enhance DSM strategies could offer significant benefits. Future research could focus on developing IoT-based solutions that enable real-time energy consumption monitoring and control, allowing consumers and utilities to make immediate adjustments based on current energy prices and demand levels.

Economic and Environmental Impact Analysis: While the paper focuses on cost reduction for consumers, future studies could assess the broader economic and environmental impacts of widespread adoption of EToU tariffs and DSM strategies. This could include evaluating the potential for CO2 emissions reduction, the economic benefits of reduced energy consumption on a national scale, and the impact on energy grid stability.
