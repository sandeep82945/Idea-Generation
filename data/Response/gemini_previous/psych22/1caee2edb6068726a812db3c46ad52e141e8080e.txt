1. **Investigate the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on health literacy, eHealth literacy, and anxiety.** This study focused on the immediate impact of the pandemic, but it would be valuable to examine how these factors change over time. This could help researchers and policymakers better understand the long-term consequences of the pandemic and develop interventions to address them.


2. **Explore the relationship between health literacy, eHealth literacy, and anxiety in different populations.** This study focused on a sample of Thai adults, but it would be interesting to see how these factors are related in other populations, such as children, adolescents, or older adults. This could help researchers and policymakers develop targeted interventions for specific populations.


3. **Examine the role of health literacy, eHealth literacy, and anxiety in promoting adherence to preventive health behaviors.** This study found that health literacy and eHealth literacy were associated with preventive health behaviors, but it did not examine the role of anxiety. Future research could investigate how anxiety interacts with health literacy and eHealth literacy to influence preventive health behaviors.


4. **Develop and evaluate interventions to improve health literacy, eHealth literacy, and anxiety.** This study highlights the importance of health literacy, eHealth literacy, and anxiety in promoting preventive health behaviors. Future research could develop and evaluate interventions to improve these factors and examine their impact on preventive health behaviors.


5. **Investigate the relationship between health literacy, eHealth literacy, and anxiety and other health outcomes.** This study focused on the relationship between health literacy, eHealth literacy, and anxiety and preventive health behaviors. Future research could examine the relationship between these factors and other health outcomes, such as mental health, chronic disease, and mortality.
