    "abstractText": "Using the colloidal method, attempts were made to deposit Au NPs on seven different material supports (TiO2, \u03b1 and \u03b3-Al2O3, HFeO2, CeO2, C, and SiO2). The deposition between 0.8 and 1 wt% of Au NPs can be generally achieved, apart for SiO2 (no deposition) and \u03b1-alumina (0.3 wt%). The resultant sizes of the Au NPs were dependent on the nature as well as the surface area of the support. The catalytic activity and selectivity of the supported Au catalysts were then compared in the alkylation of aniline by benzyl alcohol. Correlations were made between the nature of the support, the size of the Au NP, and the H-binding energy. A minimum H-binding energy of 1100 \u03bcV K\u22121 was found to be necessary for high selectivity for the secondary amine. Comparisons of the TEM images of the preand post-reaction catalysts also revealed the extent of Au NP agglomeration under the reaction conditions.",

Alkylation of amine by an alcohol by the H-borrowing mechanism. 46\nTo date, a plethora of homogeneous and heterogenous metal catalysts had been re- 47 ported for the H-auto transfer reaction, and the subject has been covered by a number of 48 comprehensive reviews [3\u20135]. Often, the imine, R2CH=NR1 and the tertiary amine 49 (R2CH2)2NR1 were observed as side products, necessitating the addition of a base to sup- 50 press these impurities. However, the inclusion of a base in such reactions can be problem- 51 atic, as it is known that these type of reactions can, indeed, proceed under basic conditions 52 without metal catalysts [6,7]. 53 In earlier work, we demonstrated that the reaction can be performed with very high 54 selectivity, in the absence of additives or base, by using a commercially available Au/TiO2 55 catalyst (AUROliteTM) in a packed bed reactor [8]. Subsequently, we initiated a study to 56 examine how metal support interactions (MSI) may affect the catalyst performance in 57 these reactions. At a very basic level, MSI reduce the mobility of metal nanoparticles on 58 the catalyst support and their tendency to agglomerate, enhancing catalytic activity and 59 stability by the maintenance of particle sizes during catalytic turnover [9]. However, MSI 60 may also be attributed to the presence of special sites at the perimeter of metal particles, 61 where chemical and electronic properties of both the metal and support atoms can influ- 62 ence the adsorbed species, thus bestowing added catalytic activity [10]. In an earlier study 63 by Ishida et al. [11]. Au catalysts supported on 9 metal oxides were prepared by different 64 methods (milling, co-precipitation and DP), and utilized in the reaction of aniline with 65 benzyl alcohol. It was found that while basic and neutral supports promote catalytic ac- 66 tivity (measured by alcohol conversion), the selectivity to secondary amine is attributed 67 to the adsorption of aniline by hydrogen bonding with Lewis acidic sites on the surface of 68 the metal oxides. However, the study did not include any analysis of of Au nanoparticles 69 (size and distribution), which can result from the different methods of operation. 70 In this work, we aim to prepare a series of Au NP\u2019s supported on different supports 71 using the colloidal method, in an attempt to study how thenature of the support may in- 72 fluence the size of the Au nanoparticles and their catalytic activity in H-auto transfer re- 73 actions. 74"

However, the inclusion of a base in such re ctions can be problematic, as it is known that these types of reactions can indeed proceed under basic conditions without metal catalysts [6,7]. In our earlier work, we demonstrated that the reaction can be performed with very high selectivity in the absence of additives or bases by using a commercially available Au/TiO2 catalyst (AUROliteTM) in a packed-bed reactor [8].

In an earlier study by Ishida et al. [11], Au catalysts supported on nine metal oxides were prepared by different methods (milling, co-precipitation, and deposition-precipitation) and utilized in the reaction of aniline with benzyl alcohol. It was found that while basic and neutral supports promote catalytic activity (measured by alcohol conversion), the selectivity to secondary amine is attributed to the adsorption of aniline by hydrogen bonding with Lewis acidic sites on the surface of the metal oxides. However, the study did not include any analysis of Au nanoparticles (size and distribution), which can result from the different methods of operation. In this work, we aim to prepare a series of Au NPs supported on different supports using the colloidal method in an attempt to study how the nature of the support may influence the size of the Au nanoparticles and their catalytic activity in H-auto transfer reactions."

The performance of Au/TiO2 pre ared by the colloidal method mirro s earlier results obtained with commercially vailable Au/TiO2 [8], with very good selectivity for the expected product 3 (entry 1). Au/\u03b3-Al2O3 also performed very well, with very similar outcomes (entry 2). In contrast, the corresponding catalyst supported on the \u03b1-allotrope was practically inactive (entry 3), which is perhaps unsurprising, given the much larger particle sizes. On the other hand, while Au supported on activated carbon and HFeO2 both afforded similar average NPs of 3.4 and 3.7 nm (Table 1, entries 4 and 5), the former is inactive compared to the moderate turnover obtained with Au/HFeO2, even in the presence of residual PVA (Table 2, entries 4 and 5). It is also interesting to see that the formation of the imine intermediate 4 was observed as the major product for the catalyst supported on activated carbon compared to the other metal oxides, which also suggests that the availability of surface hydroxyl groups is important for the H-transfer necessary to convert 4 to 3. To test this further, H2 temperature-programmed desorption (H-TPD) studies were performed with the different Au catalysts. The approximate binding energies can be calculated by multiplying the peak integration values from H-TPD analysis by the peak desorption temperatures (\u00b5mol H2 per gram cat \u00d7 peak integration). The values were subsequently plotted against the observed amine selectivity (Table 3 and Figure 3). Broadly speaking, there appears to be a direct correlation between the cat-\nInt. J. Mol.

Conversely, thermal treatment of Au catalysts prepared by the colloidal method is also found to be very susceptible to agglomeration under thermal conditions, leading to reduced catalyst activity in CO oxidation reactions [13]. In the present study, calcination resulted in three different observations: The calcination of Au/TiO2 led to a decrease in catalyst activity but did not affect the selectivity for amine 3 (Table 2, entries 1 vs. 7), while the calcination of Au/FeO2 increased the catalytic activity but did not affect the selectivity (Table 2, entries 5 vs. 8). Last but not least, the calcination of CeO2 led to the deterioration of both reactivity and selectivity (entries 6 and 9). These results show that calcinating these catalysts (with corresponding changes in particle size) does not lead to any improvements in the selectivity of the process. Indeed, agglomeration of the Au NPs may also occur during the catalytic turnover conditions. Following reactions at 180 \u25e6C for 30 min, the catalysts were recovered and subject to TEM analyses (Table 4 and Figure 2, right column). In all cases, Au particle sizes increased by between 16 and 29% for the metal oxide supports (Entries 1, 2, 3 and 5). In contrast, the recovered Au/C catalyst was found to be 1.5 times bigger than the \u2018as-prepared\u2019 catalyst (entry 4), with very dramatic changes in the particle distribution (Figure 2, right column). From this, we can surmise that one of the main roles of the (metal oxide) support is to maintain the particle size of the Au NP during the catalytic reaction.\nInt. J. Mol.

The catalyst was dried in an oven at 100 \u25e6C for 24 h before it was transferred into a round bottom flask and heated in deionised H2O at 90 \u25e6C with vigorous stirring (500 rpm) for 2 h to remove t PVA [13]. The resulti g solid was collected, w hed thoroughly with deionised H2O, and dried in an oven at 100 \u25e6C for 24 h.\nInt. J. Mol.

            "text": "An Endeavor\u00ae catalyst screening system (Biotage) was employed in this part of the work. The reactor consists of 8 parallel reaction vessels with glass inserts (working volume 5 mL). Each reaction vessel was charged with a catalyst (0.9 mol% Au, average particle size 190 \u00b5m), and 2 mL stock solutions of aniline (0.5 M) and benzyl alcohol (0.5 M) in 2-methyl-2-butanol. The reaction vessels were sealed and purged with 3 cycles of N2 before being pressurised to 15 bar. The biphasic mixtures were stirred using paddles (250 rpm) and heated to 180 \u25e6C. After 30 min, the reaction mixtures were cooled to room temperature. The reaction aliquots were extracted, diluted, and analysed using a HP 6890 Gas Chromatograph equipped with an FID detector and an Agilent HP5 column (30 m \u00d7 320 \u00b5m \u00d7 0.25 \u00b5m). 1 \u00b5L of analyte solution was injected into the inlet, which was heated to 250 \u25e6C with a split ratio of 5:1. The system was operated under a constant pressure of 20 psi with an initial column temperature of 50 \u25e6C, held for 0.5 min, heated to 65 \u25e6C @2.5 \u25e6C/min, and finally to 200 \u25e6C @25 \u25e6C/min. The conversion of benzyl alcohol and selectivity of imines, amines, and other intermediates were calculated using known standards and 4-tert-butylphenol (50 mM in methanol) as an external standard. The benzyl alcohol conversion and product selectivity were calculated as follows:\n% conversion of benzyl alcohol\n= Initial moles of BA \u2212 moles of BA in reaction mixtureInitial moles of BA \u00d7 100\n% Selectivity = moles of products in reaction mixture\nmoles of benzyl alcohol converted \u00d7 100"

            "text": "In this work, attempts were made to deposit pre-formed Au NPs onto six different supports using the colloidal method, followed by a mild hydrothermal treatment to remove the PVA stabilizer and drying (temperatures of < 100 \u25e6C). The resultant material was found to contain varying amounts of Au (from 0\u20131 wt%), and the size and distribution of Au NPs are largely dependent on the available surface area, which has a pronounced effect on the agglomeration of deposited NPs, even under mild conditions. In this regard, \u03b3-Al2O3 and TiO2 offered the smallest average particle sizes (2.6 and 2.9 nm) with a narrow distribution. Subsequently, the catalytic activity was found to be predominantly dominated by particle size\u2014calcination of the reducible metal oxides did not lead to any significant enhancement in catalytic turnover. Agglomeration of Au during the catalytic turnover is highly dependent on the nature of the support, and this will also account for the different catalyst activities. Last but not least, a direct correlation between H2 binding efficiency and catalyst activity and selectivity can be observed. Overall, this preliminary study has helped us identify some important selection criteria for future catalyst design and development. These include a better method of catalyst preparation that can improve the thermal stability of the supported nanoparticles to minimize agglomeration under reaction conditions and the selection of materials with strong H-absorptivity, as established by H-TPD studies, to improve the catalyst activity and selectivity.\nAuthor Contributions: The research work was performed by L.V.H.

The values for Au/Al2O3 (\u03b3 and \u03b1), Au/CeO2 and Au/HFeO2 were in agreement with the values reported in the literature [15\u201318]. The surface area for Au/C is lower than expected for activated charcoal [19], which may be due to the residual PVA on the surface."
