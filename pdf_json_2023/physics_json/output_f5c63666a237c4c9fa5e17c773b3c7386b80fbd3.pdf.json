    "abstractText": "(\u2013)-Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is a bioactive component of green tea that provides many health benefits. However, excessive intake of green tea may cause adverse effects of caffeine (CAF) since green tea (30\u201350 mg) has half the CAF content of coffee (80\u2013100 mg). In this work, for enhancing the health benefits of green tea, natural rubber/hexagonal mesoporous silica (NR/HMS) nanocomposites with tunable textural properties were synthesized using different amine template sizes and applied as selective adsorbents to separate EGCG and CAF from green tea. The resulting adsorbents exhibited a wormhole-like silica framework, high specific surface area (528\u2013578 m2 g\u22121), large pore volume (0.76\u20131.45 cm3 g\u22121), and hydrophobicity. The NR/HMS materials adsorbed EGCG more than CAF; the selectivity coefficient of EGCG adsorption was 3.6 times that of CAF adsorption. The EGCG adsorption capacity of the NR/HMS series was correlated with their pore size and surface hydrophobicity. Adsorption behavior was well described by a pseudo-second-order kinetic model, indicating that adsorption involved H-bonding interactions between the silanol groups of the mesoporous silica surfaces and the hydroxyl groups of EGCG and the carbonyl group of CAF. As for desorption, EGCG was more easily removed than CAF from the NR/HMS surface using an aqueous solution of ethanol. Moreover, the NR/HMS materials could be reused for EGCG adsorption at least three times. The results suggest the potential use of NR/HMS nanocomposites as selective adsorbents for the enrichment of EGCG in green tea. In addition, it could be applied as an adsorbent in the filter to reduce the CAF content in green tea by up to 81.92%.",

            "text": "(\u2212)-Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is a valuable bioactive component that is present at the highest concentration in green tea (Camellia sinensis L.). It is widely used in food, medicine, health products, and cosmetics because of its many health benefits, such as anticancer and anti-inflammatory effects [1,2], strong antimicrobial activity [3], antiviral effects [4], and prevention of HIV-1 infection [5]. EGCG is often purified from green tea by conventional methods, such as inorganic ion precipitation and solvent extraction. However, the EGCG extracted from green tea leaves using these technologies is contaminated with\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6019. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28166019 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6019 2 of 18\ncaffeine (CAF) [6,7]. Excessive CAF intake may cause adverse effects, including sleep deprivation, increased risk of cardiovascular disease, reduced fertility, and increased incidence of miscarriage [8,9]. According to regulations issued by the US Food and Drug Administration, the concentration of CAF as an ingredient in food and beverages should be limited to 200 parts per million (ppm) (0.02%) [10]. Therefore, an effective, industryoperational preparation method should be developed to obtain enriched EGCG green tea extract with as little CAF content as possible for use in pharmaceuticals, functional foods, and beverages. The chemical structure of EGCG consists of C6\u2013C3\u2013C6 with two aromatic rings and several hydroxyl groups, whereas CAF is an N-containing fused heterocyclic system with two carbonyl groups (Figure 1). Conventionally, EGCG extract for food industries is obtained from green tea via inorganic ion precipitation or organic solvent extraction due to their high EGCG separation efficiency [11,12]. Chloroform, methylene chloride, methanol, and ethanol are commonly used in solvent extraction. However, these processes have many disadvantages, such as their use of large amounts of organic solvents or inorganic salts and the high toxicity of organic solvents. Moreover, the residual solvents in EGCG extract are highly unsafe because of their carcinogenic effects. Extraction methods using supercritical CO2 [13,14], simulated moving bed chromatography [7,15], and high-speed countercurrent chromatography [16,17] have been developed to obtain high-purity EGCG extract without harmful residues. However, these methods have high operation costs due to their expensive equipment and process complexity.\nMolecules\u00a02023,\u00a028,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 2\u00a0 of\u00a0

Pure-silica esoporous aterials display distinguishing features in this application, such as high purification efficiency, si ple procedure, good stability, and easy regeneration [18\u201322]. Recently, EGCG was purified from green tea using mesoporous silica SBA-15 functionalized with aminosilane [23]. Although surface functionalization effectively enhances the adsorption selectivity of silica-based materials, it adds a process, cost, and waste discharge to adsorbent preparation. Mesoporous organic/silica hybrid materials are a class of nanocomposites that has been drawing considerable attention in the field of adsorption due to their high adsorption capacity and selectivity [24,25]. Natural rubber/hexagonal mesoporous silica (NR/HMS) is an interesting mesoporous silica-based nanocomposite; it consists of natural rubber (NR), which improves hydrophobicity, dispersed in the wormhole-like mesostructure of hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS) [26,27]. NR/HMS materials have good structural and textural properties despite the simplicity of their reproducible preparation method, use of less harmful chemical reagents, and low cost. Moreover, the hydrophobicity of NR/HMS materials is crucial for controlled-release drug delivery [28].\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6019 3 of 18\nIn this work, we investigated the selective adsorption of (\u2212)-epigallocatechin gallate and caffeine from green tea using a series of NR/HMS nanocomposites in comparison with pure-silica HMS materials. The effects of the mesopore size of these materials on EGCG and CAF adsorption capacity and selectivity were explored. An adsorption kinetic study, a simple but useful technique, was performed to gain a comprehensive understanding of EGCG and CAF adsorption on the NR/HMS nanocomposites. In addition, the performance of the NR/HMS materials in repeated adsorption\u2013desorption of EGCG and CAF was investigated to verify the practical use of the nanocomposites in the selective separation of EGCG from green tea and to provide guidance for obtaining enriched EGCG green tea extract via adsorption. Moreover, a filter containing the NR/HMS adsorbent was developed for the reduction of CAF in green tea to produce healthy drinks."

            "text": "The physicochemical properties of pure-silica HMS and the NR/HMS nanocomposites synthesized using different amine molecules are summarized in the Supplementary Materials. The XRD patterns of pure-silica HMS and the NR/HMS nanocomposites synthesized using different amine molecules are presented in Figure S1. These materials exhibited a wormhole-like hexagonal mesostructure, as evidenced by the (100) diffraction peak appearing in the 2\u03b8 range of 1.0\u20133.0\u25e6. For the same type of amine template, the NR/HMS materials had a broader, less intense peak than the HMS series because the NR molecules in the synthesis mixture disturbed the self-assembly of surfactant micelles, thereby reducing silicate condensation [26,27]. In addition, the HMS-C14 and NR/HMS-C14 nanocomposites synthesized with the longest alkyl chain template had an enhanced degree of hexagonal packing of micelles, which resulted in a well-ordered hexagonal arrangement. This result agrees with a previous report [27]. FTIR analysis was used to evaluate the presence of NR in the HMS structure of the NR/HMS composites. As shown in Figure S2. The NR/HMS-C12 was used as a representative sample to compare its chemical structure with NR and pure-silica HMSC12. The NR/HMS-C12 composite was observed between 1000 and 1300 cm\u22121, which represented the Si\u2013O\u2013Si stretching of the silica framework and exhibited a bord band at 3450 cm\u22121 related to free silanol groups (Si-OH) similar to HMS-C12. In addition, the bands that corresponded to characteristics of the NR structure at 2949, 2916, 2847, 1440, and 1365 cm\u22121 were observed. These results could suggest that the surface of HMS was partially covered by NR molecules. Figure S3 displays the typical N2 adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms of pure-silica HMS and NR/HMS materials after extraction to remove the amine templates. These materials displayed type IV isotherms (according to IUPAC classification), which are characteristic of framework-confined mesoporous materials, and exhibited high SBET values (Table S1). The pore diameters of both synthesized materials were controlled by the template chain length (Figure S3 inset), and Vt increased with the template size (Table S1). By contrast, the NR/HMS series exhibited a lower N2 adsorbed volume and broader pore size distribution than HMS for the same amine template type (Figure S3B), probably due to the presence of partially entrapped rubber chains inside the mesopores [26,27]. The hydrophobicity of these materials was represented by the monolayer adsorption volume (Vm) at standard temperature and pressure, as determined via H2O adsorption\u2013 desorption measurement (Table S1). The pure-silica HMS materials synthesized with larger amine molecules exhibited decreasing Vm values due to their reduced SBET. The NR/HMS materials exhibited lower Vm values than their HMS counterparts. This was attributed to not only the decreased SBET values of the nanocomposites but also the hydrophobic environment created by the rubber phase exposed on the material surfaces [26,27]. The morphology of the HMS-C14 and NR/HMS-C14 nanocomposite is shown in representative FE-SEM images in Figure 2. HMS-C14 revealed very small spherical aggregates of dispersed silica particles as shown in Figure 2A. The presence of NR in mesoporous\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6019 4 of 18\nsilica structure increased the agglomeration of mesoporous silica particles (Figure 2B).

            "text": "Figure 3 shows the EGCG and CAF adsorption capacity of both material series in the simulated solutions. Their EGCG adsorption capacity was higher than their CAF adsorption capacity, indicating that both pure-silica HMS and NR/HMS adsorbents favored the adsorption of EGCG rather than CAF (Figure 3). Although the NR/HMS adsorbents had a lower SBET than the pure-silica HMS, the amounts of EGCG and CAF adsorbed on these nanocomposites were higher than those on the HMS materials. Ma et al. [23] reported that EGCG adsorption is driven by the combined action of hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding, whereas CAF adsorption is driven by hydrophobic interaction only [23]. Therefore, the hydrophobicity of the NR/HMS nanocomposites had a positive effect and a large contribution to these materials\u2019 adsorption of EGCG and CAF molecules. Zhang et al. [29] modified a silica surface with polyvinyl alcohol to improve its hydrophobicity. The resulting adsorbents exhibited a high adsorption capacity for tea polyphenols due to their enhanced hydrophobic interaction. The competitive adsorption of EGCG and CAF from the green tea extract solutions by both materials is shown in Figure 4. EGCG adsorption had higher selectivity than CAF adsorption. Notably, both the pure-silica HMS and NR/HMS series exhibited higher EGCG and CAF adsorption capacity compared with adsorption in single-compound systems (Figure 3). A similar observation was reported by Zhao et al. [30]. This result suggests a synergistic effect of the mixed solutes caused by the complexation of EGCG and CAF in the green tea solutions. As shown in Figure 1, EGCG is a large bioactive molecule with three aromatic rings and several hydroxyl groups, whereas CAF is a relatively small heterocyclic compound. The pore diameter of solid sorbents is a crucial factor that determines their adsorption capacity and the diffusion of guest molecules. The EGCG and CAF adsorption capacity of the pure-silica HMS and NR/HMS materials were plotted against their pore diameters (Figure 5) to assess the effect of mesopore size on adsorption. EGCG and CAF adsorption capacity increased with the mesopore diameters of the pure-silica HMS and NR/HMS materials. The HMS-C14 and NR/HMS-C14 samples synthesized with the largest amine\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6019 5 of 18\nmolecules exhibited the highest EGCG adsorption capacity (23.50 mg/g and 32.41 mg/g, respectively). One possible explanation is that the larger pore sizes of the adsorbents enhanced the adsorption due to the increase in pore volume with the amine template size (Table S1).

The adsorption mechanism depended on the physical and/or chemical characteristics of the adsorbent. EGCG and CAF adsorption capacity reached equilibrium after 250 min and 300 min, respectively. In 0\u201380 min, both EGCG and CAF adsorption capacity increased steeply, during which the adsorbate molecules diffused into the mesopore channels of the adsorbent. Afterward, both EGCG and CAF were adsorbed on the adsorbent via interparticle adsorption.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6019 7 of 18\u00a0 ,\u00a0 ,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 7\u00a0 of\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Figure\u00a06.\u00a0Kinetic\u00a0curves\u00a0of\u00a0adsorption\u00a0of\u00a0(A)\u00a0EGCG\u00a0and\u00a0(B)\u00a0CAF\u00a0on\u00a0NR/HMS\u2010C14\u00a0at\u00a0room\u00a0tempera\u2010 ture.\u00a0\nThe\u00a0experimental\u00a0data\u00a0of\u00a0EGCG\u00a0and\u00a0CAF\u00a0adsorption\u00a0were\u00a0fitted\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0pseudo\u2010\nfirst\u2010order,\u00a0pseudo\u2010second\u2010order,\u00a0and\u00a0intraparticle\u00a0diffusion\u00a0kinetic\u00a0models,\u00a0as\u00a0shown\u00a0in\u00a0\nFigure\u00a06.\u00a0According\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0calculated\u00a0kinetic\u00a0parameters\u00a0(Table\u00a01),\u00a0the\u00a0pseudo\u2010first\u2010order\u00a0\nand\u00a0intraparticle\u00a0diffusion\u00a0models\u00a0exhibited\u00a0lower\u00a0R2\u00a0values\u00a0than\u00a0the\u00a0pseudo\u2010second\u2010or\u2010\nder\u00a0model.\u00a0The\u00a0pseudo\u2010second\u2010order\u00a0kinetic\u00a0model\u00a0was\u00a0selected\u00a0as\u00a0the\u00a0optimal\u00a0model\u00a0for\u00a0 describing\u00a0EGCG\u00a0and\u00a0CAF\u00a0adsorption\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0NR/HMS\u2010C14 adsorbent\u00a0due\u00a0to\u00a0its\u00a0high\u00a0cor\u2010 relation\u00a0coefficient\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0affinity\u00a0between\u00a0its\u00a0theoretical\u00a0adsorption\u00a0capacities\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0 experimental\u00a0adsorption\u00a0capacities.

According to the calculated kinetic parameters (Table 1), the ps udo-first-order and intraparticle diffusion models exhibited lower R2 values than the pseudo-secondmodel. The pseu o-sec d- rder kinetic model was selected s t optimal model for\nescribing EGCG and CAF a sorption on the NR/HMS-C14 adsorbent due to its high correlation coefficient and the affinity between its theoretical adsorption capacities and the experimental adsorption capacities. This model was developed from the assumption that an adsorbate binds strongly to an adsorbent surface, implying that the pseudo-secondorder kinetic model should be applicable to systems involving electronic sharing or electron transfer between adsorbates and adsorbents. Therefore, the pseudo-second-order model was suitable for describing the adsorption kinetic behavior.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6019 8 of 18\nThe equilibrium concentration of the total adsorbed EGCG (76.24 mg/g) was almost 29 times higher than that of the adsorbed CAF (2.65 mg/g) on the NR/HMS-C14 adsorbent. Adsorption selectivity was indicated by the selectivity factor (\u03b1), which was expressed as \u03b1 = [qe(EGCG)/qe(CAF)] \u00d7 [Ce(CAF)/Ce(EGCG)] [31]. Here, qe(EGCG and qe(CAF) (mg/g) are the equilibrium EGCG and CAF adsorption capacity, respectively, and Ce(EGCG) and Ce(CAF) (mg/mL) are the equilibrium concentrations of EGCG and CAF in the solutions, respectively. The adsorption selectivity coefficient of total EGCG versus CAF by the NR/HMS-C14 adsorbent was around 3.6, which was considerably higher than that of the other synthesized adsorbents (2\u20133). Therefore, the NR/HMS-C14 adsorbent preferentially adsorbed EGCG.\n2.3.2. Adsorption Isotherms\nAdsorption isotherms characterize the distribution of adsorbate molecules on an adsorbent to identify the adsorption mechanism when adsorption equilibrium is reached at a constant temperature. The equilibrium adsorption capacity (qe) of EGCG and CAF on NR/HMS-C14 at different equilibrium concentrations (Ce) was obtained at room temperature and is plotted in Figure 7. The Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption models were fitted with the experimental data to select the more suitable model. The Langmuir isotherm assumes that adsorption occurs at specific homogeneous sites within an adsorbent. The Freundlich isotherm is usable for a heterogeneous adsorbent surface with a non-uniform distribution of heat of adsorption over the surface. From the experimental and predicted adsorption data (Figure 7), the Langmuir model fit EGCG and CAF adsorption on the NR/HMS-C14 nanocomposite better as it had higher R2 values (Table 2). Thus, EGCG and CAF were adsorbed on the homogeneous sites on the adsorbent surface. These results were consistent with those of Ma et al. [23], who reported that the adsorption isotherm of EGCG adsorbed on SBA-15-NH2 fitted the Langmuir model.\nHowever, these isotherm studies suggested that the EGCG and CAF adsorption onto the surface of NR/HMS-C14 proceeded via a combination of different interaction forces. Although the adsorption of EGCG and CAF mainly provided the hydrogen bonding interaction from silanol groups on the mesoporous silica surface, it was also influenced by the hydrophobicity of the added natural rubber.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6019 9 of 18 Molecules\u00a02023,\u00a028,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 9\u00a0 of\u00a0 18\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Figure\u00a07.\u00a0Langmuir\u00a0and\u00a0Freundlich\u00a0isotherms\u00a0for\u00a0(A)\u00a0EGCG\u00a0and\u00a0(B)\u00a0CAF\u00a0adsorption\u00a0on\u00a0NR/HMS\u2010 C14.\u00a0\n2.3.3.\u00a0Adsorption\u00a0Mechanism\u00a0of\u00a0EGCG\u00a0and\u00a0CAF\u00a0on\u00a0Mesoporous\u00a0Silica\u00a0Surface\u00a0 The\u00a0surface\u00a0chemistry\u00a0of\u00a0silica\u00a0before\u00a0and\u00a0after\u00a0adsorption\u00a0was\u00a0elucidated\u00a0 to\u00a0gain\u00a0 useful\u00a0information\u00a0for\u00a0assessing\u00a0the\u00a0adsorption\u00a0mechanism.\u00a0The\u00a0major\u00a0components\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0 HMS\u00a0and\u00a0NR/HMS\u00a0materials\u00a0were\u00a0their\u00a0silica\u00a0content, and\u00a0their\u00a0surfaces\u00a0had\u00a0large\u00a0quan\u2010 tities\u00a0of\u00a0silanol\u00a0groups,\u00a0as\u00a0reported\u00a0in\u00a0previous\u00a0studies\u00a0[26,27].\u00a0Therefore,\u00a0pure\u2010silica\u00a0HMS\u2010 C14\u00a0was\u00a0used\u00a0as\u00a0a\u00a0representative\u00a0sample\u00a0to\u00a0study\u00a0the\u00a0adsorption\u00a0phenomena\u00a0while\u00a0avoid\u2010 ing\u00a0the\u00a0effect\u00a0of\u00a0other\u00a0organic\u00a0matters\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0adsorption\u00a0of\u00a0EGCG\u00a0and\u00a0CAF\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0silica\u00a0 surface.\u00a0 In\u00a0this\u00a0study,\u00a0HMS\u2010C14\u00a0was\u00a0used\u00a0as\u00a0a\u00a0representative\u00a0pure\u2010silica\u00a0adsorbent.\u00a0The\u00a0XPS\u00a0 samples\u00a0were\u00a0prepared\u00a0by\u00a0adding\u00a00.1\u00a0g\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0adsorbent\u00a0to\u00a010\u00a0mL\u00a0of\u00a0an\u00a0EGCG\u00a0or\u00a0CAF\u00a0 solution\u00a0(150\u00a0ppm)\u00a0and\u00a0stirring\u00a0for\u00a012\u00a0h\u00a0at\u00a0room\u00a0temperature.\u00a0As\u00a0shown\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a08,\u00a0the\u00a0 wide\u2010scan\u00a0XPS\u00a0results\u00a0of\u00a0pristine\u00a0HMS\u00a0and\u00a0HMS\u2010adsorbed\u00a0EGCG\u00a0and\u00a0CAF\u00a0(HMS\u2010C14\u2010\ni . g uir and Freundlich isotherms for (A) EGC and (B) CAF adsorption on NR/HMS-C14.\n2.3.3. Adsorption Mechanism of EGCG and CAF on Mesoporous Silica Surface\nThe surface chemistry of silica before and after adsorption was elucidated to gain useful inform tion for assessing the adsorption m chanism. The major omponents of the HMS and NR/HMS materials were the r silica co tent, and their surfaces had larg quantities of silanol groups, as r ported in previous studies [26,27]. Therefore, pur -silica HMS-C14 was used as a representative sample to study the adsorpti n phenomen while avoiding the effect of other organic matters on the adsorption of EGCG a d CAF on the silica surface. In this study, HMS-C14 was used as a representative pure-silica adsorbent. The XPS samples were prepared by adding 0.1 g of the adsorbent to 10 mL of an EGCG or CAF solution (150 ppm) and stirring for 12 h at room temperature.

The presence of organic species was related to the residual nonhydrolyzed ethoxy groups after the sol\u2013gel synthesis [27]. After the adsorption of EGCG and CAF on HMS-C14, the C1s signal increased. HMS-C14-EGCE had five signals at 284 eV, 284.6 eV, 285.7 eV, 287.9 eV, and 288.8 eV; these were attributed to the C=C, C\u2013C/C\u2013H, C\u2013O, C=O, and O\u2013C=O bonds, respectively, which constituted the chemical structure of the EGCG molecule [32,33]. HMS-CAF exhibited five signals at 284.6 eV, 285.1 eV, 285.9 eV, 287 eV, and 288.8 eV, which corresponded to the C\u2013C/C\u2013H, C=N, C\u2013O, C=O, and N\u2013C=O bonds, respectively, of the CAF molecule [34,35]. The O1s XPS spectra of pure-silica HMS revealed deconvoluted signals at 531 eV, 532.9 eV, and 533.9 eV (Figure 8C), corresponding to the Si\u2013O\u2013C, Si\u2013O\u2013Si, and Si\u2013O\u2013H species, respectively [27]. After adsorption, additional signals were observed at 530 eV and 531.9 eV, which were attributed to the C\u2013O\u2013H and C=O bonds, respectively, of the adsorbed EGCG and CAF molecules. The overall results suggest that there was no change in the chemical structure of the adsorbed EGCG and CAF molecules. Therefore, EGCG and CAF, with carbonyl and/or carboxyl groups, were adsorbed on the silica surface via possible hydrogen bonding with silanol groups. This phenomenon was similar to the case of EGCG and CAF adsorbed on the SBA-15 material reported by Ma et al. [23]. The mechanism of EGCG and CAF adsorption on HMS or NR/HMS adsorbents is postulated in Scheme 1. It accounts for only the interaction of the adsorbate molecules with the silanol groups of the silica surface. Furthermore, the EGCG molecule possessed a higher polarity than the CAF [14]. These results indicated a higher adsorption capacity for EGCG than CAF on both materials since hydrogen bonding occurred between EGCG and mesoporous silica HMS or NR/HMS due to the large number of hydroxyl groups in the EGCG structure.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6019 11 of 18l l \u00a0 ,\u00a0 ,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 1 \u00a0 of\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Scheme\u00a01.\u00a0Interactions\u00a0of\u00a0EGCG\u00a0and\u00a0CAF\u00a0on\u00a0NR/HMS\u00a0nanocomposite.\u00a0\n2.4.\u00a0Desorption\u00a0Capacity\u00a0and\u00a0Desorption\u00a0Ratio\u00a0 The\u00a0EGCG\u00a0and\u00a0CAF\u00a0adsorbed\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0NR/HMS\u2010C14\u00a0adsorbent\u00a0were\u00a0desorbed\u00a0by\u00a0dif\u2010 ferent\u00a0eluents\u00a0in\u00a0ethanol/deionized\u00a0water\u00a0solutions\u00a0with\u00a0various\u00a0(v/v)\u00a0ratios.

In addition, an increase in the amount of deionized wat r in the tested eluents reduced the desorption efficiency f both adsorbates.

Therefore, a simple experiment was conducted to verify the effectiveness of NR/HMS adsorbent for reducing CAF in green tea to produce healthy drinks. We developed filters containing different amounts of NR/HMS nanocomposites, such as 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 g of filters A, B, and C, respectively (Figure 11). An amount of 30 mL of green tea containing approximately 104 mg/L of CAF was poured through a filter. Then, the filtrate was analyzed using HPLC to determine the amount of CAF in green tea after filtration. The study found that the percent removal of CAF in green tea using the three filters was ranked in the following descending order: filter C > filter B > filter A, which corresponded to the amount of the NR/HMS contained in the filter (Figure 11).

After 1 h, TEOS was added dropwise, and the resulting mixture was vigorously stirred for 0.5 h at 40 \u25e6C and then aged at ambient temperature for 18 h. Subsequently, the white solid was recovered by filtration, thoroughly washed with deionized water, and dried at 100 \u25e6C overnight to obtain as-synthesized HMS. Finally, the amine template was removed by refluxing 3 g of the as-synthesized HMS with 150 mL of a 0.05 M H2SO4/ethanol solution for 4 h. The generated HMS materials were labeled HMS-Cn, where n is the number of carbon atoms of the primary amine.\n3.2.2. Synthesis of NR/HMS Nanocomposites\nNR/HMS nanocomposites were synthesized using different primary amine templates via an in situ sol\u2013gel process [27]. In a typical synthesis, an NR sheet (0.5 g) was saturated with TEOS (10 g) at room temperature for 16 h. The resulting swollen NR was weighed to determine the TEOS content (~1.8 g) and then dissolved in THF through vigorous stirring overnight. A primary amine and an additional amount of TEOS (~8.7 g) were slowly added to this colloidal solution via constant stirring at 40 \u25e6C for 30 min. Subsequently, deionized water was added to the resulting mixture by stirring. The molar composition of the synthesized mixture was 0.10 TEOS:0.04 amine:5.89 H2O:0.37 THF:0.01 NR. After 1 h of stirring, the white gel was kept at 40 \u25e6C for 3 days and then precipitated in 100 mL of ethanol. The recovery of the solid product and the template removal procedure were the same as those described in Section 3.2.1. The template-free nanocomposites were named NR/HMS-Cn, where n is the number of carbon atoms of the primary amine."

            "text": "The proposed NR/HMS nanocomposites, which had diverse pore sizes and hydrophobicity, exhibited a higher EGCG and CAF adsorption efficiency than the pure-silica HMS series. The pore size and hydrophobicity of the mesoporous silica materials played critical roles in the highly efficient and selective adsorption of EGCG by the nanocomposite. In addition, the major driving force for the adsorption of EGCG and CAF on the mesoporous silica surface was hydrogen bonding. NR/HMS-C14, with its large pore size and hydrophobicity, showed the highest EGCG adsorption capacity (32.41 mg/g) among all the synthesized adsorbents. The kinetic data fitted well using a pseudo-second-order kinetic model, and the adsorption selectivity coefficient of EGCG was 3.6. The adsorption results of EGCG and CAF fitted the Langmuir model better than the Freundlich model. Large amounts of EGCG and CAF could be removed from the NR/HMS surface using a solution of ethanol and deionized water (80:20, v/v) as the solvent, and NR/HMS exhibited a higher desorption capacity for EGCG than CAF. Moreover, the NR/HMS materials could be reused three times for EGCG adsorption. These findings demonstrate that the NR/HMS nanocomposite can be an excellent EGCG adsorbent in aqueous solutions. It is a promising tool for the separation and enrichment of EGCG from complex natural products. It can also be applied as an adsorbent in a simple filter to reduce the CAF in green tea.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www. mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28166019/s1, Figure S1: XRD patterns of (A) pure-silica HMS materials and (B) NR/HMS nanocomposites; Figure S2: FTIR spectra of Natural Rubber, (b) HMS-C12 and (c) NR/ HMS-C12 composite; Figure S3: N2 adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms and BJH pore size distribution of (A) pure-silica HMS materials and (B) NR/HMS nanocomposites; Table S1: Textural properties and water adsorption volumes of pure-silica HMS and NR/HMS nanocomposites.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, C.N. and S.N.; Methodology, R.K., M.T. and S.Y.; Validation, S.Y. and C.N.; Formal analysis, S.N.; Investigation, K.J., S.Y., C.N. and S.N.; Resources, T.Y.; Data curation, S.N.; Writing \u2013 original draft, S.N.; Writing \u2013 review & editing, C.N.; Funding acquisition, T.Y.
