            "text": "Accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars (AMXPs) are rapidly-rotating (spin frequency > 30 Hz) neutron stars (NS) gravitationally bound with late-type companion stars (see e.g., Di Salvo & Sanna 2020; Patruno & Watts 2021, for extensive reviews). Their distinct short spin periods are a direct consequence of prolonged mass transfer phases in which the companion star loses matter via Roche-lobe overflow, subsequently accreted onto the NS (recycling scenario; Alpar et al. 1982). The sample currently includes 24 sources, a third of which are characterised by an orbital period shorter than 80 minutes (also known as ultra-compact binaries). Short orbital periods suggest small low-mass companion stars, consistent with donor masses on average <0.2 M . MAXI J1957+032 was observed for the first time by MAXI (Negoro et al. 2015) and INTEGRAL (Cherepashchuk et al. 2015) in May 2015. At odds with standard low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs)\n\u2605 E-mail: andrea.sanna@dsf.unica.it\nMAXI J1957+032 exhibited four short (< 5 days) faint outbursts between its discovery and October 2016 (Sugimoto et al. 2015; Tanaka et al. 2016). Optical observations of the system during its 2016 outburst revealed emission compatible with an irradiated X-ray disc in a LMXB, suggesting similarities with AMXPs (Mata S\u00e1nchez et al. 2017). An optical counterpart (late-K/early-M dwarf star) has been identified during the X-ray quiescence phase, setting a constraint on the source distance of the order of 5 \u00b1 2 kpc (Ravi 2017). However, the outburst properties of MAXI J1957+032 let the author to suggest that the observed counterpart is likely not the mass donor. Instead, it is suggested to be a possible triple system, with the main-sequence counterpart likely being in a wide orbit around a compact interacting binary. Moreover, the spectral evolution investigated by combining the Swift observations collected during the four outbursts suggested that, for a distance of the order of 4 kpc, a neutron star (NS) might be hosted in the binary system (Beri et al. 2019). On June 18, 2022, MAXI/GSC detected X-ray activity in the direction of MAXI J1957+032 (Negoro et al. 2022). NICER quickly started monitoring the new outburst, discovering coherent X-ray pul-\n\u00a9 2022 The Authors\nar X\niv :2\n20 8.\n05 80\n7v 1\n[ as\ntr o-\nph .H\nsations at \u223c314 Hz and revealing the nature of the accreting compact object (Ng et al. 2022). A preliminary orbital solution obtained from continued NICER observations suggests that MAXI J1957+032 is an ultra-compact binary with an orbital period of \u223c 1 hour (Bult et al. 2022). Swift/XRT observations on June 20, 2022, suggested spectral properties consistent with the 2016 outburst of the source (see, e.g. Beri et al. 2019). Moreover, Swift/UVOT detected the UV counterpart of the source, with a magnitude UVW2 = 20.37 \u00b1 0.08 (Beri et al. 2022). On June 21 MAXI J1957+032 was not detected in radio by the MeerKAT observatory, with an upper limit of 48 \ud835\udf07Jy (van den E\u0133nden et al. 2022). Optical observations suggested the presence of short timescale variability during the outburst (Baglio et al. 2022), and a significant optical counterpart during the 50 days before the outburst, with the first optical brightening almost nine hours earlier to the MAXI/GSC trigger (Wang et al. 2022). On June 23, Swift revealed no significant X-ray activity at the source location, suggesting that MAXI J1957+032 may have entered the quiescence phase (Chandra 2022). Here, we report on the discovery of millisecond X-ray pulsations from the X-ray transientMAXI J1957+032 and its spectral properties from the NICER observations collected during its latest outburst."

            "text": "MAXI J1957+032 was observed by NICER X-ray telescope on the International Space Station (Gendreau et al. 2016) from June 19, 2022 to June 24 (ObsIDs 5202840101-6) for a total exposure time of \u223c 22.5 ks after standard filtering. We also included a short data segment (\u223c 40 seconds at MJD \u223c59740.1) collected during a raster scan performed to better constrain the source position. We retained events in the 0.5\u201310 keV energy band by processing the observations with HEASoft version 6.30.1 and the NICER software NICERDAS version 9.0 (2022-01-17_V009) with standard screening criteria. We extracted source and background spectra in the 0.5\u201310 keV energy range using the nibackgen3C50 tool (Remillard et al. 2022), and we generated response matrices using the nicerrmf and nicerarf tools. The analysis was performed with Xspec 12.12.1 (Arnaud 1996) after applying an optimal binning, which guarantees at least 25 counts per energy bin. The top panel of Figure 1 shows the background-subtracted light curve of the outburst monitored by NICER (black points). Each point represents the 16s average count rate. ObsIDs 5202840105-6 are not shown since the source count rate is compatible with the background. The source count rate at the peak of the observed outburst is \u223c 160 cts s\u22121, which exponentially decreases to the quiescence level in almost four days. No Type-I thermonuclear X-ray bursts were observed during the observations. Finally, we applied barycentric corrections to the photon arrival times utilising the barycorr tool adopting JPL DE-405 Solar system ephemeris. We considered the best available source position coordinates obtained by Chandra during the 2015 and 2016 outbursts (Chakrabarty et al. 2016)."

            "text": "Following the detection of X-ray pulsations at \u223c 314 Hz (Ng et al. 2022),we proceeded by searching forX-ray pulsations over short time intervals (between 150 and 500 seconds, depending on the statistics of the data segment) by performing epoch-folding search techniques\nusing 8 phase bins and starting with the spin frequency value \ud835\udf08 = 313.643740 Hz (Bult et al. 2022). We explored the frequency space with a 10\u22125 Hz frequency step for a total of 10001 steps. We detected significant X-ray pulsations in 38 of the 60 data segments. The signal frequency value and uncertainty for each data segment have been determined following the method described by Leahy (1987). The temporal evolution of the detected signal (second panel of Figure 1, red stars) is compatible with an orbital modulation. Assuming a circular orbit, we obtained the best-fit for an orbital period of \ud835\udc43orb = 3653.47(69) seconds, a projected semi-major axis of the NS orbit \ud835\udc65 = 0.01367(35) lt-s, an epoch of ascending node passage \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc36 = 59749.63327(22) MJD, and a spin frequency \ud835\udf08 = 313.64373(12) Hz (Figure 1, second panel, solid line). We then proceeded with the phase-coherent timing analysis by generating pulse phase delays in the time interval between MJD 59749.625494 and MJD 59749.648643 (June 19; for an exposure time of \u223c 1.3 ks), where the NICER count rate is higher. We folded data segments of \u223c200 seconds into 8 phase bins at the preliminary spin frequency \ud835\udf08.We thenmodelled each pulse profilewith a constant plus a sinusoidal function, and we retained profiles for which the pulse amplitude is at least three times larger than its uncertainty. We modelled the pulse phase evolution with a constant frequency combined with a circular Keplerian orbital model (see Sanna et al. 2016, for a more detailed description of the procedure). Due to the short baseline covered by the dataset with respect to the orbital modulation of the system and the relatively small uncertainties on the orbital period and projected semi-major axes, we only explored corrections on the spin frequency and the epoch of ascending node passage. The best-fit is obtained for \ud835\udf08 = 313.6436542(61) Hz, and \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc36 = 59749.633066(17) MJD. We then propagated the solution to the nearest (in time) data segments verifying that the phase uncertainty remained smaller than half of a spin cycle, a condition required for the application of phase-coherent analysis. It is noteworthy that a similar conclusion can be reached even accounting for spin frequency derivatives | \u00a4\ud835\udf08 | \u2264 10\u221211 Hz s\u22121, orders of magnitude larger than the values observed for AMXPs (see, e.g., Di Salvo & Sanna 2020). We generated pulse phase delays for each increased dataset and fitted them, searching for a stable timing solution, until we covered the whole outburst. As shown in the fourth panel of Figure 1, the pulse phase delays from the most accurate timing solution show a phase jump of \u223c0.2 pulse cycles around MJD 59750.2. To account for that, we included in the model a phase jump around MJD 59750.2. The best-fit orbital and pulsar spin parameters from the latter model are reported in Table 1, while its associated residuals are shown in the fifth panel of Figure 1. A close inspection suggests a further modulation of the residuals on timescales longer than the binary orbital period. We tested this hypothesis by comparing a constant against a constant plus a sinusoidal function. The latter showed an F-test probability of \u223c 1.7 \u00d7 10\u22123, corresponding to a \u223c 3\ud835\udf0e statistical improvement due to the additional component characterised by an amplitude of (3.3 \u00b1 0.8) \u00d7 10\u22122 phase cycles, and period 1.99 \u00b1 0.14 days. To further investigate the effect of the phase jump, we generated the average pulse profile pre and post-phase jump (Figure 2). Both profiles are well described as the superposition of three harmonically related sinusoidal functions. The fundamental, second, and third harmonics of the pre-jump profile are characterised by fractional amplitudes of (7.9 \u00b1 0.2)%, (2.7 \u00b1 0.2)%, and (2.0 \u00b1 0.3)%, respectively. The post-jump profile presents fractional amplitudes of (10.6\u00b1 0.4)%, (2.9\u00b1 0.5)%, and (0.9\u00b1 0.4)% for the fundamental, second and third harmonics, respectively. In the third panel of Figure 1, we report the evolution of the\nMNRAS 000, 1\u20135 (2022)\nbackground-corrected fractional amplitude of the pulse profile estimated from the best-fitting solution (filled circles), as well as upper limits for non-detection (filled triangles). The fractional amplitude remains almost constant around the value of 7.5% for the first two days when it starts to increase, reaching a value of \u223c 32% during the last signal detection."

Data intervals selected to create the spectra are shown in Figure 1. To perform the spectral analysis, we set Wilms et al. (2000) elemental abundances and Verner et al. (1996) photo-electric cross-sections. The 0.5\u201310 keV energy spectra are well modelled by an absorbed thermal component (black-body) combined with a power-law continuum (TBabs*[bbodyrad+powerlaw] in Xspec). The best-fit values of NH vary from (0.9 \u00b1 0.1) \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 (obtained in #1) up to an average value of (2.5 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 for the other intervals. We noticed that the Galactic absorption in the direction of the source is estimated to be \u223c 1 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 (HI4PI Collaboration et al. 2016). Moving from #1 to #4, the black-body temperature (kT\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc35) decreased significantly from (0.45 \u00b1 0.01) keV down to (0.26 \u00b1 0.03) keV, as well as its normalisation that varies from (5.3\u00b12.2) km to 1.6+2\u22121 km (estimated at 5\u00b12 kpc; Ravi 2017), compatible with a fraction of the NS surface. The power-law photon index at the peak is \u0393 = 1.58\u00b10.04, compatible with the source being in a hard state. As expected, during the descending phase,\u0393 increases, reaching the final value of 2.81\u00b10.03. We detected clear correlations between NH, kT\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc35 and \u0393 by Goodman-Weare algorithm of Monte Carlo Markov Chain (Goodman & Weare 2010) characterised by 20 walkers and chain length of 106. However, the observed spectral evolution cannot be explained only by model degeneracy. We found no evidence for spectral lines (e.g., iron K-\ud835\udefc) nor reflection features. Finally, the unabsorbed 0.5\u201310 keV flux decreases from (2.95 \u00b1 0.02) \u00d7 10\u221210 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 to (8.06 \u00b1 0.08) \u00d7 10\u221212 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 close to the quiescence phase."

            "text": "We reported on the temporal and spectral properties of the newly discovered AMXP MAXI J1957+032 during its latest outburst as monitored by NICER. The detection of coherent X-ray pulsations at \u223c 314 Hz allowed us to identify the accreting compact object as a\nMNRAS 000, 1\u20135 (2022)\nrapidly-rotating NS, confirming the hypothesis drawn from the previous outbursts (see, e.g., Mata S\u00e1nchez et al. 2017; Ravi 2017; Beri et al. 2019). We interpreted the sinusoidal drift of the X-ray pulsation as the result of the Doppler modulation of the pulsation frequency in a binary system with an orbital period of \u223c 1 hour. Phase-coherent timing analysis allowed us to refine the orbital ephemeris (Table 1). Pulse phase delays estimated from the best-fit timing solution show a clear jump of \u223c0.2 phase cycles. Similar shifts have been reported for SAX J1808.4\u22123658 (Burderi et al. 2006), XTE J1814\u2212338 (Papitto et al. 2007), XTE J1807\u2212294 (Riggio et al. 2008; Patruno et al. 2010), SWIFT J1749.4\u22122807 (Sanna et al. 2022), and MAXI J1816\u2212195 (Bult et al. 2022, submitted). As shown in Figure 2, the average pulse profile loses harmonic content after the phase jump, with an increase in the fractional amplitude of the fundamental component and a decrease of the third harmonic (detected at a 2\ud835\udf0e c.l.). No correlation between the phase jump and X-ray count rate seems to exist. The origin of phase jumps in AMXPs is still an open question, and the investigation of the mechanisms proposed to explain them is beyond the scope of this work (see, e.g., Bildsten 1998; Lamb et al. 2009; Poutanen et al. 2009; Riggio et al. 2011; Long et al. 2012, for some of the proposed scenarios). Moreover, we found marginal evidence of modulation in the phase residuals with a \u223c 2 days period and amplitude of \u223c 0.03 phase cycles. If confirmed, this could signify a planet-like object (with mass . 10\u22123 M ) gravitationally bound to the binary system. We attempted to set a preliminary constraint on the NS dipolar magnetic field. Assuming the spin equilibrium for the X-ray pulsar, we can then express the magnetic field as:\n\ud835\udc35 = 0.63 \ud835\udf01\u22127/6 ( \ud835\udc43spin 2ms )7/6 ( \ud835\udc40 1.4\ud835\udc40 )1/3 ( \u00a4\ud835\udc40 10\u221210\ud835\udc40 /yr )1/2 108 G,\n(1)\nwhere \ud835\udf01 (generally between 0.1\u20131) corresponds to the ratio between the magnetospheric radius and the Alfv\u00e9n radius (see, e.g., Ghosh &\nLamb 1979; Wang 1996), \ud835\udc43spin and \ud835\udc40 are the pulsar spin period and mass, respectively, and \u00a4\ud835\udc40 represents the mass accretion rate onto the NS. Considering the peak unabsorbed flux (0.5\u201310 keV) and a source distance of 5\u00b1 2 kpc (Ravi 2017), we infer \u00a4\ud835\udc40 ' 0.76\u00d7 10\u221210 M yr\u22121 for a NS radius andmass of 1.4M and 10 km, respectively. From Eq. 1, we estimate a dipolar magnetic field ranging between 1 \u00d7 108 G and 1.4 \u00d7 109 G, in line with the typical magnetic field of known AMXPs (see, e.g., Mukherjee et al. 2015). The NS mass function \ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc5a2, \ud835\udc5a1, \ud835\udc56) \u223c 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22126 M , combined with the absence of total eclipses or dips in the X-ray light curve (inclination . 60\u25e6; see, e.g., Frank et al. 1987) suggest a lower limit on the companion star mass of \ud835\udc5a2 & 1.7 \u00d7 10\u22122 M (for a 1.4 M NS), which increases up to \ud835\udc5a2 & 2.1 \u00d7 10\u22122 M if we consider a 2 M NS. We derive the donor radius as a function of its mass, \ud835\udc452 ' 0.2\ud835\udc5a1/32 \ud835\udc43 2/3 \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4f,1\u210e R , by combining the Roche-Lobe overflow contact condition (\ud835\udc452 \u2248 \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc3f2) with the NS mass function. To further investigate the nature of the donor star, in Figure 4, we compare the latter expression (solid-black line) with different types of low-mass stars. Red-dashed lines represent theoretical mass-radius relations for warm (2.5 \u00d7 106 K) and hot (7.9 \u00d7 106 K) Helium white dwarfs (He WD; Deloye & Bildsten 2003). Warm He WDs seem unlikely given the required inclination \u223c 90\u25e6. On the other hand, hot HeWDs would imply a donor mass \u223c 0.045 M , with an orbital inclination of \u223c 20\u25e6. Brown-dotted lines represent numerically simulated massradius relations for brown dwarfs at 5 and 10 Gyr (Chabrier et al. 2009). Intersections between the curves suggest a brown dwarf donor star with mass of 0.043\u22120.085 M , which corresponds to an orbital inclination between 20 and 10 degrees. However, we cannot exclude the possibility of the donor being bloated with respect to its thermal equilibrium radius because of irradiation from the compact object. Further studies are needed to favour one of the proposed scenarios. Nevertheless, these constraints on the donor mass strongly support the scenario for which the late-K/early-M dwarf star identified as the optical counterpart of MAXI J1957+032 is not the donor star of the detected AMXP, but is instead a member of a triple system with an ultracompact AMXP binary (Ravi 2017). Finally, the energy spectrum is well described by an absorbed soft\nMNRAS 000, 1\u20135 (2022)\nblack-body-like component (\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc47 \u223c 0.4 keV) compatible with emission from the NS surface plus a power-law-like component characterised by \u0393 \u223c 1.6 in line with typical thermal Comptonised components observed in the hard state of AMXPs (see, e.g. Falanga et al. 2005; Gierli\u0144ski & Poutanen 2005; Sanna et al. 2017a). The cooling of the black-body temperature and the increase of the power-law photon index as the source X-ray activity dims out are in line with the spectral evolution of the previous outbursts of the source (Beri et al. 2019), as well as other AMXPs (see, e.g., Ng et al. 2021; Sanna et al. 2018c). We found no evidence for iron K-\ud835\udefc, nor reflection components in the NICER band. Interestingly, a similar result has been reported for at least other four ultra-compact AMXPs, i.e., IGR J16597\u22123704 (Sanna et al. 2018b), XTE J1807\u2212294 (Campana et al. 2003), XTE J1751\u2212305 (Miller et al. 2003), and SWIFT J1756.9\u22122508 (see, e.g., Sanna et al. 2018a; Koliopanos et al. 2021). However, evidence for iron lines has been reported for compact systems such as NGC 6440X\u22122 (Heinke et al. 2010),MAXI J0911\u2212655 (Sanna et al. 2017b), and IGR J17062\u22126143 (Degenaar et al. 2017). Assuming a source distance \ud835\udc51 = 5 \u00b1 2 kpc (Ravi 2017), we constrain the peak luminosity during the latest outburst in the range \ud835\udc3f = (3.2 \u2212 17.2) \u00d7 1035 erg s\u22121 taking into account the distance uncertainty, consistent with MAXI J1957+032 being a very faint X-ray transient (see, e.g., W\u0133nands et al. 2006; Beri et al. 2019)."
