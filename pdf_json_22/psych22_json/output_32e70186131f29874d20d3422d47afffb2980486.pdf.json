    "abstractText": "Errors can elicit post-error adjustments that serve to optimize performance by preventing further errors. An essential but unsolved issue is that whether post-error adjustments are domain-general or domain-specific, which was investigated in the present study through eliciting different types of errors. Behavioral and electrophysiological data were recorded when male and female subjects performed the Eriksen flanker task. For this study, we examined the aforementioned issue by combining event-related potential and multivariate pattern analysis. The results indicated that post-error slowing, error-related negativity, and error positivity were comparable between congruent and incongruent errors, indicating that errors triggered domaingeneral interference mechanisms, whereas post-error accuracy and late positive potential elicited by incongruent errors were larger than those elicited by congruent errors, exhibiting domain-specific control adjustment mechanisms. Importantly, no successful decoding soon after errors was found between congruent and incongruent errors, but above-chance decoding was observed between these two types of errors with increasing time, which further support that domain-general adjustments occurred in the early stage, whereas domain-specific adjustments appeared in the late stage. Furthermore, brain-behavior correlation results suggested that the late post-error adjustments predicted subsequent behavior performance. Together, this study revealed that early domain-general interference adjustments induced by errors are reflected in error detection and error awareness, which are independent of error types; on the contrary, late domain-specific control adjustments are reflected in attentional adjustments, which are modulated by error types.",

Together, this study revealed that early domain-general interference adjustments induced by errors are reflected in error detection and error awareness, which are independent of error types; on the contrary, late domain-specific control adjustments are reflected in attentional adjustments, which are modulated by error types.\nKey words: error types; event-related potential; multivariate pattern analysis; post-error adjustments\nSignificance Statement\nTo date, clear evidence on the specificity of post-error adjustments is lacking. The present study provides neurophysiological evidence that post-error adjustments simultaneously rely on both domain-general and domain-specific mechanisms. Eventrelated potential results indicated that domain-general adjustments were accompanied by the interference of error detection and error awareness. In contrast, domain-specific adjustments were associated with attentional adjustments. Multivariate pattern analysis further decoded the two features of post-error adjustments in the early stage matching the time patterns of error-related negativity and error positivity and in the late stage corresponding to the late positive potential. Temporal generalization analysis showed that domain-specific processing appeared stably in late post-error adjustments. Hence, we propose that post-error different stages may determine the specificity of post-error adjustments."

            "text": "Error commission usually induces the necessary adjustments to avoid repeating errors, which are termed \u201cposterror adjustments.\u201d Recent studies have hypothesized that\npost-error adjustments include general adjustments reflected in reduced sensitivity (i.e., the decrease of perceptual sensitivity to task-relevant sensory information) and increased decision boundary (i.e., the raise of response threshold or motor inhibition process) universally after errors, and specific adjustments manifested in increased task-related selective attention with time (Ullsperger and Danielmeier, 2016). Obviously, these suggest that both domain-general and domain-specific adjustments may occur, but the available evidence is rather weak. This study aimed to test these hypotheses by exploiting behavioral and neural approaches.\nSeveral studies have attempted to clarify the nature of errorinduced adjustments; however, the limitations of existing evidence need to be considered.

Steinhauser et al. (2017) designed a dual-task paradigm in which the color task and tone task separated by a variable stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA), and reported that errors in the color task caused post-error slowing (PES) both in the tone task of the same trial and the color task of the next trial. The former effect disappeared with an increasing SOA, reflecting that errors induced transient, task-unspecific adjustments; whereas the latter effect was independent of SOA and lasted for several trials, suggesting more long-lasting, task-specific adjustments. Clearly, several limitations should be concerned. First, the length of RSIs or SOA determines the specificity of adjustments after errors but affects its integrality because of the different available times after errors. Second, in the study conducted by Steinhauser et al. (2017), error sources in the two tasks may be confused by additional factors (e.g., response criterion and task-related attention states), thus disturbing subsequent adjustments. Third, the abovementioned studies only infer the features of adjustments after errors based on behavioral evidence, rather than providing more direct neural evidence.\nConsidering these limitations, we manipulated two types of errors in the same flanker task by Eriksen and Eriksen (1974), namely, the errors on congruent trials (congruent errors) and those on incongruent trials (incongruent errors). This design was adopted for three reasons. First, it could eliminate the confounding effect of additional factors by adopting two types of errors elicited under the same RSIs in the same task. Second, in error-related paradigms, they have broad representation as the most basic and typical types of errors (Beatty et al., 2021). Third, they are induced by two types of distinct and stable sources. Congruent errors are mainly caused by insufficient attention to task-related information, such as speed pressure or unspecific noise, whereas incongruent errors are mainly because of interferences evoked by task-irrelevant information.\nEvent-related potential (ERP) methods provide important evidence on post-error adjustments in which error-related negativity (ERN) and error positivity (Pe) have been consistently reported (Ullsperger et al., 2014). ERN may be associated with error detection, whereas Pe is likely related to error awareness. Moreover, effortful attentional allocation processing affects the late positive potential (LPP), which is associated with attentional adjustments after errors (Hajcak et al., 2010). Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) is relatively sensitive in decoding the temporal course of the specificity evoked by errors (Fahrenfort et al., 2018), and supports for examining the temporal stability of decoding performance (King and Dehaene, 2014). Therefore, ERP and MVPA methods may provide valuable data for clarifying the features of error-induced adjustments.\nIn the present investigation, post-congruent and post-incongruent error behaviors and EEG responses were compared in a flanker task. Our central hypothesis was that post-error adjustments are domain-general in the early stage but domain-specific in the late stage. Accordingly, comparable PES, ERN, Pe, and around-chance decoding between congruent and incongruent errors should be observed because of interference universally following errors. In contrast, we should observe divergent posterror accuracy (PEA), LPP, and above-chance decoding between them because of task-related control adjustments."

Post-error adjustments between different types of errors were examined using the Eriksen flanker task (Eriksen and Eriksen, 1974). The experimental task was performed using a program designed with E-Prime 2.0 (Psychology Software Tools). The experimental program was run on a 19 inch Dell monitor with a refresh rate of 85Hz and a resolution of 1024 768. The experimental stimuli were presented on the central screen.\nAt the beginning of the flanker task, an instruction screen was presented, in which subjects were instructed to remember the stimulus\u2013response mapping rules and respond to the targets as quickly and accurately as possible. Each trial began with the appearance of a white fixation point for 150ms, followed by five white arrows on a black background for 100ms (Fig. 1). The direction of the middle arrow was \u201c,\u201c or \u201c.,\u201d corresponding to the response button \u201cF\u201d with the left index finger or \u201cJ\u201d with the right index finger. Subjects had to respond to the direction of the middle arrow and ignore the flankers on each side before a 1500ms response deadline. The congruent trial included flankers facing the same direction as the middle arrow (e.g., , , , , , or . . . . .), whereas the incongruent trial included flankers facing the opposite direction as the middle arrow (e.g., , , . , , or . . , . .). Once a response was given, the next trial began after an intertrial interval of 800ms. Each block contained 96 trials, with 50% congruent trials and 50% incongruent trials presented randomly in the block. The feedback of response accuracy was provided on the screen after each block during practice session; however, no feedback was given during the formal experiment. The subjects first performed two practice blocks of 96 trials. They were allowed to participate in the formal experiment when the average error rate was ,15%. The formal experiment consisted of 20 blocks with a total of 1920 trials. The entire experiment lasted for;1 h.\nExperimental design and statistical analyses Behavioral analysis. For all analyses, trials in which response times (RTs) for correct responses in congruent trials (congruent corrects), correct responses in incongruent trials (incongruent corrects), congruent errors, and incongruent errors that deviated.3 SDs away from the condition mean were removed. The RT and accuracy were computed for each condition. PES was calculated as the difference between the RT on correct trials following errors and that on correct trials following correct responses. PEA was calculated as the difference between the accuracy of trials following errors and that of trials following correct responses (Rabbitt, 1966; Danielmeier and Ullsperger, 2011; Wang et al., 2015; Li et al., 2020). The RT and accuracy were analyzed using repeated-\nmeasures ANOVA, with within-subject factors of previous congruency (congruent, incongruent) and previous response type (correct response, error response), respectively. The unit for the RT was milliseconds."

            "text": "Considering the higher sensitivity of multivariate analyses in decoding higher-order cognitive processes, MVPA was applied to the preprocessed EEG data. Trials were classified into four trial types according to current congruency (i.e., congruent and incongruent) and current response type (i.e., correct response and error response). MVPA involved a backward decoding classification algorithm (linear discriminant analysis), with two of the four trial types as classes (i.e., incongruent errors and congruent errors, incongruent errors and incongruent corrects, congruent errors and congruent corrects, incongruent corrects and congruent corrects) and all electrodes as features. The analysis aimed to examine whether the classifier could learn from divergent EEG patterns following each single-trial response to distinguish between different types of errors.\nThe Amsterdam Decoding and Modeling toolbox (Fahrenfort et al., 2018) was used for the preprocessed EEG data. Before MVPA, the EEG data were undersampled to 50Hz owing to the time-consuming decoding algorithms. A classifier was trained and tested at each time point by using a five fold cross-validation procedure; that is, the trials were sequentially randomized and split into five equal-sized folds. Subsequently, a leave-one-out procedure was performed (i.e., the classifier was trained on four folds and tested on the remaining fold). This procedure was repeated 5 times until all data were tested. Classifier performance was determined using the mean of test folds. As a measure of classification accuracy, the area under the curve (AUC) per time point was used. Larger AUC values indexed higher classification accuracy (Fahrenfort et al., 2018). To avoid the subtle biases of the next trial correctness on the classification performance,\nall classification analyses were limited to the trials in which the subsequent trial was correct. Within-class balancing using undersampling was applied for the next trial congruency (i.e., the trials were randomly selected from the conditions with more trials to balance the conditions with fewer trials), such that the count of subsequent congruent and subsequent incongruent trials was the same within each class. This procedure ensured that the training of the classifier was not biased by the next trial congruency. Considering the potential different estimations that may result from the unbalanced design (asymmetric trial counts), between-class balancing using undersampling (i.e., a random selection of trials from the conditions with more trials) was applied to ensure that the classifier would not develop a bias for the overrepresented class during training. Moreover, to rule out the subtle effects of the next trial RT on the classification performance, for incongruent errors and congruent errors, and incongruent corrects and congruent corrects, the procedure randomly selected trials in the conditions with more trials to match the next trial RT in the conditions with fewer trials (i.e., paired sample t tests between the two classes showed no significant differences in the next trial RT, p. 0.05). As a result, the following trial counts entered the analyses for each classification (mean given): incongruent errors and congruent errors (39 trials per condition, 78 trials in total), incongruent errors and incongruent corrects (132 trials per condition, 264 trials in total), congruent errors and congruent corrects (39 trials per condition, 78 trials in total), and incongruent corrects and congruent corrects (657 trials per condition, 1314 trials in total). Furthermore, a temporal generalization analysis using classification across time was performed (King and Dehaene, 2014). This analysis was used to evaluate the stability of neural activity patterns with underlying classification performance by testing the classifier at the same time point on which it was trained. After that, temporal generalization matrices for time-by-time classification accuracy were obtained. As a result, the classification accuracy outside the diagonal axis was the above-chance level, suggesting stable neural activity. AUC values were calculated at each time point with double-sided t tests across subjects against a 50% chance level. Cluster-based permutation tests (p, 0.05, 1000 iterations) were then used to perform multiple-comparison correction for these t tests over time. According to the observed cluster size, the null distribution of the cluster size under random permutation was determined, and the p values for the clusters were calculated using this comparison (Fahrenfort et al., 2018)."

To test whether errorrelated processing (ERN, Pe, LPP) could predict post-error behavior (PES, PEA) on a single-trial level, similar to Buzzell et al. (2017), we performed generalized linear mixed-effects analyses using the R statistical software, version 4.1.3 (R Core Team, 2016), combining with the lme4 package, version 1.1-29 (Bates et al., 2015) and the lmerTest package, version 3.1-3 (Kuznetsova et al., 2016). These analyses were not planned a priori and should therefore be considered exploratory. Since statistical analyses were run to explore the specificity of error-induced adjustments based on different types of errors, we conducted the single-trial correlation analyses only on congruent errors and incongruent errors.\nBefore carrying out each analysis, models were built such that the continuous variables (ERN amplitude, Pe amplitude, LPP amplitude, next trial RT) were centered and scaled to have a mean of 0 and SD of 1 across the dataset, and the category variables (current congruency, next trial accuracy) were entered using sum and contrast. The continuous variables were fitted using linear mixed-effects analysis using the lmer function, with restricted maximum likelihood estimation. And the categorical variables were fitted using generalized linear mixed-effects models using the glmer function with logit link with maximum likelihood estimation.\nWithin each model, the variation in the within-subjects intercept was treated as a random effect, and the effects of interest and their interactions (plus an intercept) were treated as fixed effects. We adopted the lmerTest, using the Satterthwaite\u2019s approximation to denominator degrees of freedom, to calculate the statistical significance for each fixed\neffect (Kuznetsova et al., 2016). We defined the mixed-effects models with the following formula:\nY \u00bc Xb 1Zg 1 \u00ab\nHere, Y represents the response variable, X is the fixed effect design matrix, b is the fixed effect coefficient, Z indicates the random effect design matrix, g is the random effect coefficient, and \u00ab represents the error term.\nWe used the syntax of the R Package lme4 to construct the mixedeffects models as follows:\nlmer dependent var; 11 \u00f0fixed effect 1\nfixed effect 2\u00de1 \u00f01jSubject\u00de\nThis syntax represents a model with a fixed effect on the whole model intercept (the initial \u20181\u2019), fixed effects on all independent variables of interest and their interactions, and a random effect on the variation in intercept per participant (\u20181|Subject\u2019).\nTo examine the effect of error-related ERN, Pe, or LPP and current congruency (congruent vs incongruent) on subsequent behavior, we constructed separate models for next trial RT and next trial accuracy. Considering our interest in post-error adjustments, we limited the types of trials in all models. When predicting the next trial RT, we limited the pairs of trials in which the subsequent trial was correct. When predicting the next trial accuracy, we limited the trials in which the current trial was error.\nAcross-subject AUC-behavior correlation analysis To further investigate the behavioral relevance of significant classification of error types, we tested how classification performance correlated to PES and PEA on the response to the two types of errors. These correlation analyses were not planned a priori. Therefore, these results should be considered exploratory to better characterize the robust results\nderived from the classification analyses, and should enrich our understanding of the data. First, we locked the time window of significant above-chance classifications between congruent errors and incongruent errors (i.e., the time window in which AUC was significant at p, 0.05), and calculated the mean AUC values for each subject within this time window. Next, two across-subject Pearson\u2019s correlation analyses were run between the individual AUC values and PES, and between individual AUC values and PEA. Through this procedure, we thus linked significant classification of error types from neural activity to subsequent behavioral performance."

With respect to incongruent and congruent errors, MVPA revealed a significant above-chance difference between classes of incongruent and congruent errors from 700 to 1500ms after errors occurred (the late stage after errors) (p, 0.05, cluster-corrected). Regarding incongruent errors and incongruent corrects as well as congruent errors and congruent corrects, MVPA showed a significant abovechance difference between the two classes from response initiation to 1500ms after responses (the whole decoding stage after responses) (p, 0.05, cluster-corrected). As for incongruent and congruent corrects, MVPA revealed a significant above-chance difference between the two classes from response initiation to 680ms after responses (the early stage after correct responses) (p, 0.05, cluster-corrected).

The time-bytime generalization results are presented in Figure 4B. For incongruent and congruent errors, a cluster was detected at the abovechance level from 200 to 1500ms after responses. That is, the time generalization matrix indicated that the neural activity from 200 to 1500ms after responses could be decoded by classifiers trained during the time window from 700 to 1500ms, suggesting that the differences between incongruent and congruent errors were maintained stably over time. Additionally, for incongruent errors and incongruent corrects as well as congruent errors and congruent corrects, the above-chance activities were detected from 0 to 1500ms. As for incongruent and congruent corrects, significant above-chance activity showed stable neural activity pattern from 0 to 680ms after responses.\nDuring the time windows of significant classification performance, the topographical patterns of forward transformation weights with high spatial resolution revealed that the spatial activity patterns were different among different datasets, but there were no significant clusters of electrodes (Fig. 4C). This exhibited that the involvement of neural activity depended on a complex spatial pattern, rather than being bound to a specific brain region."

            "text": "The present study investigated the specificity of post-error adjustments by examining behavioral and neural effects across congruent and incongruent errors in the flanker task. Regarding the RT results, PES was present on both types of errors, which may be attributable to the interference triggered by a resource-consuming monitoring process (Jentzsch and Dudschig, 2009) or a distracting orienting response (Notebaert et al., 2009) immediately after errors, exhibiting domain-general mechanisms. Although PEA did not differ from post-correct accuracy on congruent trials, the former was higher than the latter on incongruent trials, which was attributable to stronger attentional adjustments after incongruent errors (Ullsperger et al., 2014; Steinhauser and Andersen, 2019), indicating domain-\nspecific mechanisms. Thus, errors elicit both domain-general and domain-specific mechanisms. For ERP results, with regard to ERN and Pe, the contrasts between errors and correct responses followed the same pattern no matter on congruent or incongruent trials, and the two ERP amplitudes did not differ between congruent and incongruent errors. With respect to MVPA results, above-chance decoding was constantly detectable between errors and correct responses, regardless of congruent or incongruent trials; in contrast, significant decoding was not observed between congruent and incongruent errors in the early stage after responses. These EEG results indicate that different types of errors were analogous in early post-error adjustments, such as error detection (Coles et al., 2001) and error awareness (Overbeek et al., 2005), suggesting that domain-general processing was involved in the early stage. Importantly, the LPP amplitude induced by incongruent errors was greater than that induced by congruent errors. Moreover, MVPA yielded convergent results with the conventional ERP analysis and showed significant above-chance decoding between congruent and incongruent errors in the late stage after responses. Thus, different types of errors result in distinct neural responses in late posterror adjustments, indicating domain-specific processing.\nERN is believed to reflect error detection, which is related to the detection of a mismatch between the response that was made and the appropriate response (Coles et al., 2001). Pe is associated\nwith error awareness (Nieuwenhuis et al., 2001; Overbeek et al., 2005), reflecting evidence accumulation to determine whether post-error adjustments occurred (Steinhauser and Yeung, 2010). The present results showed that the two types of errors make no difference in the basic error-related processes (error detection and error awareness). Accordingly, we propose that the comparable ERN and Pe results between congruent and incongruent errors reflect the domain-general mechanisms involved in errorinduced adjustments, which should be independent of specific error types. However, not all error-related neural signatures led to this post-error adjustment. In addition to the two abovementioned ERP components, errors were also associated with the LPP, and this effect depended on the congruency of error trials. The LPP has been linked to the elaborate processing of human action in previous studies (Hajcak et al., 2010) and has been shown to represent selective attention ability in effortful attentional allocation and cognitive control (Miller et al., 2011; Mun et al., 2014). In this case, the significantly greater LPP amplitudes on incongruent errors may indicate that more attentional adjustments were implemented, which favors adaptive adjustments after incongruent errors. Accordingly, the divergent results for congruent and incongruent errors on LPP suggest that post-error adjustments induce domain-specific mechanisms, which are sensitive to error types.\nStatistically, MVPA is more sensitive than the conventional ERP analysis. It combines with whole-brain activity to depict neural activity patterns over time (LaRocque et al., 2014; Stokes et al., 2015; van Ede et al., 2018; De Vries et al., 2019). The MVPA results of this study indicated that no reliable decoding was found for congruent and incongruent errors from 0 to 700ms after responses, which is the time window corresponding to ERN and Pe. Nonetheless, above-chance decoding was observed for congruent and incongruent errors during the time window from 700 to 1500ms, which matches the time pattern of the LPP. After successful decoding for the two types of errors based on their neural activity patterns, a further examination of neural activity is its stability over time (Takacs et al., 2020). The above-chance decoding was based on a more stable pattern of neural activity in the time window from 200 to 1500ms than that during other windows, implying that stable difference patterns between the two types of errors appear in late post-error adjustments. These results potentially indicate that, from the time course of post-error adjustments, domain-general processing occurs in the early stage, including the two subprocesses (error detection and error awareness), whereas domain-specific proc-\npost-error adjustments directly promoting\nsubsequent behavior performance. The supply of central resources seems crucial for the specificity of post-error adjustments. According to recent studies, both ERN and Pe would lead to an impairment in sensory processing on subsequent trials (Buzzell et al., 2017; Li et al., 2021). Hence, the two basic error-related processes (error detection and error awareness) are thought to place a high demand on central resources, which may leave insufficient central resources for subsequent processing, thereby leading to impaired performance after errors. Moreover, previous studies have reported that ERN is responsible for PES, but not PEA (Debener et al., 2005; West and Travers, 2008). Accordingly, for congruent and incongruent errors, the comparable ERN and Pe as well as the early unsuccessful decoding indicate that error detection and error awareness may consume a similar amount of resources between the two types of errors, which is consistent with the comparable PES between them. In this case, early error-induced adjustments would cause a disturbance, regardless of congruent or incongruent errors, exhibiting domain-general interference mechanisms. In contrast, adequate central resources seem to improve posterror performance (Li et al., 2021). In the present study, the greater LPP evoked by incongruent errors as well as the late successful decoding for the two types of errors showed that more\ncentral resources should be recruited by incongruent errors. Whereas incongruent errors still drove PES, indicating that the supplemented central resources in the late stage would not offset the PES caused by the consumed resources in the early stage. Indeed, from the brain-behavior correlations, more central resources would be supplied for incongruent errors in the late stage, which might be used to focus on target-related information on incongruent trials and thus improve the PEA, indicating domain-specific control adjustment mechanisms.\nIn addition, the LPP amplitude for incongruent corrects was smaller than that for congruent corrects. From the perspective of central resource consumption, conflict-related processing may consume a large amount of central resources during the early stage after incongruent corrects, indexed by the above-chance decoding for congruent and incongruent corrects in the time window centered at 0 and 680ms after correct responses. Thus, the supply of resources may be reduced in the late stage, which should account for the attenuated LPP after incongruent corrects relative to congruent corrects.\nTheoretically, the two-stage account of error evaluation proposed by Maier et al. (2011) involves an early evaluation stage during task processing and a late evaluation stage after the execution of a response. The early stage evaluates the state of system parameters \u201cpreceding\u201d the response, and initiates source-specific adaptive adjustments \u201csucceeding\u201d the response (Maier and Steinhauser, 2013). In line with the results of Maier et al. (2011), we also identified that posterror behavioral adjustments matched the error types. Whereas the difference between our investigation and that of Maier et al. (2011) is that, after the errors occurred in the present study, both source-general and source-specific adjustments were triggered; in comparison, only the latter were mentioned in the study by Maier et al. (2011). Moreover, the MVPA results even sensitively revealed the time boundary under which source-specific adjustments were chosen (;700ms after errors).\nIn conclusion, the present study provides the first piece of neurophysiological evidence regarding the specificity of posterror adjustments, which was achieved by combining ERP methods with MVPA. The results indicated that post-error adjustments involved two mechanisms: First, in the early stage, the errors induced domain-general interference mechanisms, including error detection and error awareness, indexed by aroundchance decoding as well as comparable ERN and Pe between congruent and incongruent errors. Second, in the late stage, the errors evoked domain-specific control adjustment mechanisms, including task-related attentional adjustments, indexed by above-chance decoding and distinct LPP between congruent and incongruent errors, which can directly improve performance on subsequent trials. Therefore, post-error adjustments involved domain-general and domain-specific adjustments at various stages."
