    "abstractText": "1School of Nursing, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA; 2School of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA; 3College of Social Sciences and Humanities, Koc University, Istanbul, Turkey; 4Department of Psychology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA Background and Purpose: African Americans (AAs) are twice as likely to develop dementia than Whites, which may be driven by poorer dementia knowledge and lifestyle factors. This article provides the rationale and protocol for a pilot clinical trial examining a tailored multidomain lifestyle modification intervention in middle-aged and older AAs. This study will explore the feasibility and efficacy of individualized cognitive prescriptions (CogRx) which target five domains: physical activity, cognitive activity, diet, sleep, and social activity. Theoretical underpinnings include Social Cognitive Theory and the Health Belief Model, which suggest that tailored risk factor information, goal-setting, and outcome expectations along with addressing self-efficacy and barriers will promote behavior change. Study Design: This study plans to enroll 150 community-dwelling AA participants aged 45\u201365 without significant cognitive impairment. After baseline assessment including datadriven assessment of deficiencies in each of the five CogRx domains, participants are randomized with equal allocation to either: psychoeducation + CogRx, psychoeducation only, or no-contact control. The psychoeducation and CogRx groups receive general psychoeducation on dementia prevalence, prognosis, and risk factors, while the CogRx group also receives information on their risk factor profile and develops a tailored three-month intervention plan, consisting of simple evidence-based strategies to implement. The CogRx condition receives text-messaging reminders and adherence queries and provides feedback on this program. Conclusion: This study tests a novel multidomain dementia prevention intervention and has several strengths, including enrolling middle-aged AAs with a focus on prevention, assessing adherence and self-efficacy, tailoring the intervention, and examining dementia knowledge. The goal is to yield new perspectives on person-centered dementia prevention approaches in diverse populations and ultimately impact clinical and public health recommendations for maintaining cognitive health, thereby reducing disparities in dementia. Modifications to study design due to COVID-19 and future directions are discussed.",

This article provides the rationale and protocol for a pilot clinical trial examining a tailored multidomain lifestyle modification intervention in middle-aged and older AAs. This study will explore the feasibility and efficacy of individualized cognitive prescriptions (CogRx) which target five domains: physical activity, cognitive activity, diet, sleep, and social activity. Theoretical underpinnings include Social Cognitive Theory and the Health Belief Model, which suggest that tailored risk factor information, goal-setting, and outcome expectations along with addressing self-efficacy and barriers will promote behavior change. Study Design: This study plans to enroll 150 community-dwelling AA participants aged 45\u201365 without significant cognitive impairment. After baseline assessment including datadriven assessment of deficiencies in each of the five CogRx domains, participants are randomized with equal allocation to either: psychoeducation + CogRx, psychoeducation only, or no-contact control. The psychoeducation and CogRx groups receive general psychoeducation on dementia prevalence, prognosis, and risk factors, while the CogRx group also receives information on their risk factor profile and develops a tailored three-month intervention plan, consisting of simple evidence-based strategies to implement. The CogRx condition receives text-messaging reminders and adherence queries and provides feedback on this program. Conclusion: This study tests a novel multidomain dementia prevention intervention and has several strengths, including enrolling middle-aged AAs with a focus on prevention, assessing adherence and self-efficacy, tailoring the intervention, and examining dementia knowledge. The goal is to yield new perspectives on person-centered dementia prevention approaches in diverse populations and ultimately impact clinical and public health recommendations for maintaining cognitive health, thereby reducing disparities in dementia. Modifications to study design due to COVID-19 and future directions are discussed.

Furthermore, very few multidomain approaches have specifically targeted AAs, despite their increased\nvulnerability to dementia and evidence that AAs may have poorer knowledge and unique concerns and beliefs about dementia and AD, including not being aware of the higher risk in AAs.24\u201327 Rovner et al recently conducted a randomized controlled trial among AAs aged 65+ with mild cognitive impairment and found a significant reduction in risk of memory decline in N=77 participants receiving a behavioral activation intervention (designed to increase cognitive, physical, and/or social activity) compared to N=87 receiving supportive therapy (an attention control treatment).28 While groundbreaking, further work is needed among middle-aged AAs who have not yet developed cognitive impairment, and for whom interventions may be most beneficial.\nThe purpose of this article is to provide the rationale and describe the protocol for a clinical trial of an intervention approach designed to address weaknesses in prior work. Study progress, pitfalls, and modifications to the study due to the COVID-19 pandemic are also discussed. The current study is the among the first to explore the feasibility and efficacy of an individualized psychoeducation dementia risk reduction approach, dubbed Cognitive Prescriptions (CogRx), that aims to overcome prior studies\u2019 limitations and synergize their strengths in a population vulnerable to dementia. This approach is grounded in Social Cognitive Theory29 and the Health Belief Model,30 in that it focuses on the notion that cognitive factors (eg, knowledge, beliefs, self-efficacy) are key determinants of behavior change, and that in order to change behavior, perceived susceptibility, severity, benefits, and barriers must be addressed. These models are consistently used in behavior change studies among AAs,31 including the prior study by Rovner et al.28 Informing participants of their deficient areas, educating them on outcome expectations, and facilitating them with developing short-term, realistic goals may enhance motivation and self-efficacy by framing how these changes are in their overall self-interest for successful aging. Figure 1 contains detail on the conceptual framework for this study."

Specific aim 1, focusing on proximal outcomes, seeks to determine whether the CogRx condition is superior to psychoeducation alone in improving engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors at three months and whether these changes remain at six months. We also examine whether the CogRx and psychoeducation only conditions will experience improved dementia knowledge compared to the no-contact control\nNursing: Research and Reviews 2022:12 https://doi.org/10.2147/NRR.S339200 DovePress\n3\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nat three months and whether this knowledge is retained at six months. Aim 1 will also examine within the CogRx condition, the association between adherence and selfefficacy data gathered via text messaging and improvements in lifestyle behaviors. Specific aim 2, focusing on distal outcomes, will compare the three conditions on a brief battery of cognitive and psychological measures (eg, depressive symptoms, self-rated successful aging) after three months and six months. This study will also examine if these effects on distal outcomes will be mediated by gains in the aforementioned primary outcomes (ie, health behaviors, dementia knowledge, and adherence and self-efficacy\u2014in the intervention group only). Finally, the exploratory aim employs qualitative interviews with CogRx participants to determine feedback for future implementation of this program, including barriers and facilitators to engagement/adherence, and likelihood of continuing the program. As mentioned below, our study will also have data to examine the impact of COVID-19 on engagement in health behaviors as well as COVID-19 literacy."

            "text": "This study is funded by the National Institute on Aging, was approved by the UAB Institutional Review Board (protocol # 300003029), and is being conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The ClinicalTrials. gov number is NCT03864536. Community-dwelling middle-aged AA adults aged 45\u201365 are being recruited for this study, with flyers in the community and an advertisement in the online listing of university studies. After obtaining verbal consent to screen, a telephone screen determines the following self-reported eligibility criteria: age 45 to 65, no neurological (including dementia diagnosis) or severe psychiatric disorders (eg, schizophrenia or bipolar disorder), no insomnia (to eliminate those with clinical sleep deficiencies that may not be amendable to behavioral intervention), must be ambulatory (in order to reduce confounding effect of this factor on baseline physical activity and to allow for physical activity Rx), and must have a working cell phone with unlimited texting. The Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS)32 is also administered to exclude those with cognitive impairment in the moderate to severe range (score \u226423). The rationale for including those with normal cognitive functioning and mild impairment, but not more severe impairment is threefold: (1) this allows for examination of both prophylactic and rehabilitative effects on outcomes, as\nwell as the ability to examine adherence in those who may already have some impairment; (2) by including community-dwelling middle-aged adults with normal functioning or subtle impairment, we reduce the confounding effect of using a clinical sample (ie, mild cognitive impairment, MCI or AD), yielding more generalizable results; and (3) in this middle-aged sample of AAs, it is expected that a large percent will have some subtle impairment attributable to multiple factors; thus, including only those with normal cognitive functioning would not be feasible for this two-year study.\nEligible participants then provide written informed consent and complete a baseline assessment including an assessment of strengths and deficiencies in CogRx domains (Tables 1 and 2). After baseline testing it must be determined that participants have deficiencies in at least two of five CogRx domains in order to be further randomized to one of three conditions: no-contact control, psychoeducation only, and psychoeducation + CogRx. The Excel-based randomization algorithm matches conditions on demographics (age, education, gender). If participants are not deficient in at least two of five CogRx domains, the baseline visit completes participation and they are not further randomized in the study. The intervention groups return for a one-time visit (described below). All participants return for three- and six-month follow-ups. Research assistants conduct the assessments while a dedicated interventionist administers the intervention protocol. Participants are compensated $50 each for the four-hour baseline, and three- and six-month posttests. Intervention groups receive $50 for the intervention visit. Additional compensation of $20 is provided to CogRx participants who respond to a majority of their adherence textmessages (described below).\nIn light of COVID-19, several modifications have been made to the study protocol in an attempt to both ensure the safety of study staff and participants, as well as to capture the influence of the pandemic on study measures and outcomes. Specifically, the need has emerged to limit inperson data collection to only those measures that are absolutely essential to be done in person, while administering the remaining measures via phone and mail. Much consideration has been given to maintaining data integrity and consistency with this hybrid protocol. This is further described in the Study Progress and Modifications section below. Further, several additional measures have been added to the battery regarding COVID-19 (described below).\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/NRR.S339200 DovePress Nursing: Research and Reviews 2022:12 4\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)"

In accordance with the Health Belief Model, the topics include dementia severity (statistics on prevalence and prognosis of the disease), susceptibility (increased risk in AAs, including genetics, family history, and vascular risk factors), and finally risk/protective factors (general info on the five CogRx domains plus vascular control and depression management). This concludes the visit for the psychoeducation only condition.\nAfter this presentation, the CogRx condition develops their tailored intervention plan. The research assistant explains whether they had \u201coptimal\u201d or \u201csuboptimal\u201d levels in each of the five domains using published guidelines and/or evidenced-based criteria59,61,65,67,70 (Table 2). For domains that are optimal, participants are encouraged to maintain their level of engagement. For domains that are suboptimal, corresponding science-based strategies to bolster those areas are explained using a tailored informational presentation (Figure 3 shows materials provided to participants). Participants then engage in a structured goal-setting process to identify specific goals for each domain. Participants with deficits in all five domains prioritize three to avoid over-burdening the participant. They are instructed to choose domains that are the most important\nNursing: Research and Reviews 2022:12 https://doi.org/10.2147/NRR.S339200 DovePress\n7\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nto them and that are the most feasible. The goal-setting process is conducted using the Bangor Goal Setting Interview (BGSI)20 approach, which is grounded in Social Cognitive Theory of Behavior Change29 and the concept of motivational interviewing. Specifically these steps include: (1) identifying areas to work on, (2) setting goals, and (3) assessing goal attainment (at follow-up). Goals are identified in accordance with SMART71 principles (specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and timely) (eg, \u201cI will go for a 30-minute walk once per day\u201d) (Figure 4 shows materials provided to participants). The Rx in each domain is relatively general and standard with some choices within each (eg, type of physical activity). Participants are also queried on barriers to these goals, and ways to overcome such barriers when possible. Participants are asked to integrate activities in their daily lives and work on their goals over the following three-month period.\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/NRR.S339200 DovePress Nursing: Research and Reviews 2022:12 8\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)"

Specifically, motivational reminders and adherence and self-efficacy questions are sent automatically via textmessages to participants\u2019 personal cell phones using the SurveySignal program. Participants receive one automated daily text-based reminder in the morning at 8 am (ie, \u201cDon\u2019t forget to do your healthy lifestyle activities today!\u201d) as well as one query on their self-efficacy perceptions (ie, \u201cI feel confident that I have the power to achieve my CogRx goals.\u201d) to which they respond with a simple number (1=not true at all to 10=very true). Then in the evening at 8 pm they receive up to three text messages (depending on how many CogRx domains they are assigned, which may be two or three) with questions regarding adherence for that day (eg, \u201cOverall, how well would you say you met your diet goals today?\u201d) to which they respond with a simple number (1=not very well to 10=very well). These responses will be used to create an\nNursing: Research and Reviews 2022:12 https://doi.org/10.2147/NRR.S339200 DovePress\n9\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nadherence and self-efficacy score for each participant, which will be an average of their response each day of the three-month intervention period. The text messages are monitored by a research assistant to track responsiveness and check for any technical issues (eg, automated texts not sent at correct time). If a participant has not responded to any text messages in two days, a research assistant calls them to see if they are having any issues and reminds them to respond to all texts in a timely manner. To incentivize responsiveness, if participants respond to at least 75% of text messages by the end of the three-month intervention period they receive an additional $20 in compensation."

Enrollment began in January 2020, however, due to a research shutdown because of COVID-19, no new participants were enrolled from March 2020 to August 2020. Thus far, the study has screened 95 people and enrolled 46 participants, of which 39 participants were randomized (14 control, 12 psychoeducation, 13 intervention). Thirty-three participants have completed three months follow-up, 22 have completed six months follow-up, and 0 have been lost to attrition. Modifications to the study when research resumption began in September 2020 included moving to a hybrid data collection model. Specifically, study assessments and the intervention transitioned to a hybrid of inperson, phone, and mail assessment modality to limit in-person contact. A footnote in Table 1 details the format for each data collection measure. The intervention session for psychoeducation (for both psychoeducation control group and CogRx group) remained as an in person format, while the additional CogRx program (ie, feedback and goal setting) was conducted via phone. Another change\nis that whereas the original protocol proposed to complete full baseline assessments to determine eligibility, now in order to minimize non-essential contact, participants complete the cognitive prescription domain measures via phone, after determining basic eligibility criteria. Therefore, only eligible participants complete a full baseline assessment. Finally, a change in recruitment has been made, such that the study now also recruits via social media (ie, targeted Facebook ads). Of the 95 total people who have been screened, 60 found out about the study via the study ad, and 26 of those were actually enrolled."

Next, the distributions of each outcome will be analyzed and if needed transformations will be applied. Missing data will be handled using mixed effects models which deliver unbiased estimates when the data are missing conditionally at random . Otherwise, multiple imputation techniques with sensitivity analyses will be employed.73 The G*Power program74 was used for sample size analysis which indicated that a total sample size of 150 (50 per group) provides an 80% power to detect a moderate effect size75 (Cohen\u2019s d = 0.64), at a corrected significance level of 0.01. We plan to enroll a sample size of N=165 to account for a conservative estimated attrition rate of 10%, resulting in a N=150 final sample.\nFor Specific Aim 1, Proximal Outcomes, to determine whether the CogRx condition is superior to psychoeducation alone in improving engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors and dementia knowledge, longitudinal analyses using mixed-effects modeling approach will be employed.76 Specifically, the dependent variables we will examine are lifestyle behaviors (ie, the total scores for the individual surveys for each of the CogRx domains, as well as binary variables indicating whether or not the participant is in the risk range (Table 2) and dementia knowledge (ie, total scores for these measures). As a sensitivity analysis, generalized estimating equations will be used to estimate linear models with the repeated measurements. Strength of relationships among variables will be interpreted using effect sizes such as standardized regression coefficients (for continuous predictors) and standardized mean differences (for categorical predictors).

For cognitive functioning z-score composites within each domain will be created as well as a global cognition composite. Regression (mediation analysis) will be used to examine whether gains in these outcomes are mediated by Aim 1 gains in lifestyle behaviors.\nFor the Exploratory/Qualitative Feedback Aim, to conduct qualitative interviews with CogRx participants to determine feedback for future implementation of this program, including barriers and facilitators to engagement/ adherence and likelihood of continuing the program, interview data will first be transcribed and imported into NVivo qualitative analytic software.

            "heading": "Discussion",
            "text": "Despite the increased risk for AD and other dementias in AAs, the significant evidence on the role health behaviors may play in this risk, and evidence of less AD knowledge in AAs, virtually no studies have targeted this population in behavioral modification dementia risk reduction interventions. The implications of this study are important for health-care professionals who are ideally positioned to educate and improve brain health literacy for their patients at risk of developing dementia. Identifying culturally relevant, feasible and ecologically valid lifespan intervention approaches for this population are paramount. The current study addresses the aforementioned gaps with existing multidomain lifestyle modification approaches, including examining a broader range of domains. Indeed, studies suggest that a broad spectrum of activities provide more benefit than any one specific activity17 and that up to half of AD cases may be attributable to modifiable factors.9 Another limitation of existing multidomain lifestyle interventions that the current study addresses is measurement of adherence with text-messaging. Indeed, studies support the acceptability of using mobile technology in AAs as both reminders/motivators of health behaviors and to assess adherence and other real-time queries.77,78 This\ninnovative study provides the first attempt to test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of dementia psychoeducation combined with tailored \u201cCognitive Prescriptions\u201d79 compared to psychoeducation only and no-contact control groups in middle-aged AAs in the Deep South. The psychoeducation targets general dementia knowledge, concerns, and beliefs by presenting information about dementia severity (eg, prevalence, prognosis) and susceptibility (eg, increased risk in AA) as well as risk and protective factors. The CogRx condition also receives tailored feedback on their profile of risk/protective factors (ie, physical activity, cognitive activity, social activity, diet, sleep) as well as developing intervention goals. These malleable domains may be especially viable behavioral targets for intervention and may have secondary positive reciprocal outcomes (eg, physical activity and sleep). This approach is grounded in Social Cognitive Theory29 and the Health Belief Model,30 with the premise that in order to change behavior, perceived susceptibility, severity, benefits, and barriers must be addressed.\nResults from this study will fill many gaps in the literature. First, this study will determine whether a brief dementia psychoeducational program is effective in improving dementia knowledge in middle-aged AA adults, and whether this learned knowledge is durable for up to six months. Next, this study will elucidate whether psychoeducation plus individualized behavioral plans are more effective in improving engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors than psychoeducation alone. The text messaging adherence and self-efficacy data will also allow for determining whether these variables are associated with pre-post gains in the CogRx intervention group. This study will also allow for examining if these individualized plans tailored to one\u2019s deficient areas are effective not only in improving engagement in the respective domains, but also whether there are downstream positive effects on domains not directly targeted in one\u2019s intervention plan. While this pilot feasibility study only follows-up participants for six months and given that participants will not have severe cognitive impairment at baseline, our results will nonetheless shed light on whether this intervention has any positive effects at three and six months on cognitive functioning and psychosocial outcomes. Importantly, the qualitative feedback provided will allow for determination of areas of the intervention that warrant modification in future work, as well as common barriers and facilitators that AAs experience in engaging in healthy lifestyle behaviors that will inform future iterations of\nNursing: Research and Reviews 2022:12 https://doi.org/10.2147/NRR.S339200 DovePress\n11\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nthis program. Importantly per barriers, our study will examine qualitative and quantitative data on how COVID-19 has affected participants\u2019 lives, including specifically engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors. We will also have a rich dataset of additional COVID-19 variables, including COVID-19 knowledge/literacy. These measures are particularly germane in the current study sample, as AAs are heavily burdened by the US COVID-19 pandemic.80\u201382 In addition to adding-in COVID-19 specific measures, we have also modified our protocol by implementing a COVID-19 hybrid data collection plan that minimizes social contact by only conducting in-person assessments for measures that are absolutely essential. We have also added social media as a recruitment approach, which has proven very successful. Therefore, the study team has overcome the obstacles of conducting a clinical trial during a pandemic. Indeed, we have had an excellent retention rate.\nThis study is not without limitations, in terms of study design and COVID-related obstacles previously mentioned. First, the sample size is small, though this is appropriate for this pilot study that is focused on generating feasibility, acceptability, and effect size data. Second, this study is limited by subjective measurement of the CogRx domains, including of behavior change over time. Third, and related to the prior point, is the lack of objective biomarker data that may shed light on any mechanisms whereby these domains may impact cognition. Fourth, the text messaging protocol is not personalized, which may be more beneficial in promoting behavior change.\nIf positive results emerge in the current study, future studies of this approach could address several important topics. First, future work should include objective assessment of improvement in CogRx domains (eg, actigraphy) and mechanisms whereby these changes affect cognition (eg, imaging, biomarkers) over longer followup periods to examine preventing/delaying MCI and AD vs improving existing impairment. Second, future work may include individualized text-based reminders (eg, preferences for time of day, content) and also further stratify intervention groups into those that receive motivational reminders vs those who do not receive them, which will allow for a better understanding on the efficacy in such reminders in promoting behavior change. Third, examination of the CogRx approach in other atrisk populations (eg, HIV, traumatic brain injury) is a worthy avenue for future work. Finally, future\nimplementation science research will provide important implications for translating this approach into community and clinical settings.\nThe clinical implications of this work are significant. Results may provide support for increasing dissemination of psychoeducation on dementia prevention health behaviors, which may be provided in diverse health-care settings by interdisciplinary clinicians. Similarly, if the CogRx tailored plans are effective at improving engagement in health behaviors, this may support the deployment of a similar approach in clinical settings. For example, brief patient work-ups on multidomain risk factor profiles will not only provide a basis for cognitive prescriptions, but also the process of providing feedback to patients on deficient areas and engaging in goal setting may promote adherence. Further, many patients may not otherwise know that they are deficient in certain areas and this process would shed light on their brain health behaviors."
