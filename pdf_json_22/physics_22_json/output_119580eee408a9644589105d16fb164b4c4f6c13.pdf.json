The magnetization and heat capacity data show the absence of long-range magnetic order at least down to 2 K. A positive Curie-Weiss temperature \u03b8W ~ 45 K probed by the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility indicates that a Kitaev interaction is dominant. These observations suggest that a quantum spin liquid may have been realized. Furthermore, the observation of linear temperature-dependent contribution to the heat capacity with no magnetic field effect evidences gapless excitation. These facts are surprisingly contrary to the chemical disorder evidenced by the crystallographic analysis. By discussing the differences in the size effect of Z2-fluxes in 2D and 3D Kitaev magnets, we propose that there is a hidden mechanism to protect the quantum spin liquid state from chemical disorder.\nIntroduction. The Kitaev model\u2014a model recognized by Ising-like bond-dependent interactions on a tricoordinated lattice\u2014has attracted much attention as the most promising platform to realize a quantum spin liquid state (QSL) [1-4]. One of the essential features in the Kitaev QSL is that the spins are fractionalized into itinerant Majorana fermions and localized Z2-fluxes [1,5-8]. The Kitaev model is materialized by the superexchange interactions between spin-orbitalcoupled Jeff = 1/2 electrons in 4d/5d transition metal ions with a low-spin d5 electron configuration through the JackeliKhaliullin mechanism [2].\nIn realistic compounds, the Kitaev QSL state is easily destabilized by the unquenched non-Kitaev interactions, for example, the Heisenberg interaction J and the off-diagonal interaction \u0393 [9-12]. Indeed, almost all Kitaev candidate materials exhibit long-range magnetic orderings. The magnitude of these interactions is strongly dependent on the microscopic environment around Ir ions, especially the Ir-OIr bridging angle and trigonal distortion of IrO6 octahedra [13,14].\nUnder the circumstance, one can consider that the Kitaev interaction term K can be relatively enhanced by reducing the J and \u0393 terms with appropriate adjustments of the crystal structure. There are two feasible and effective tuning strategies. One is the application of hydrostatic pressure. At first glance, it appears that pressure can be applied to adjust the lattice parameters without disturbing the system. However, all of these attempts have failed so far\u2014previous high-pressure studies have shown that the formation of molecular orbitals\ndue to increased orbital overlap between ions causes them to become nonmagnetic in \u03b1-Li2IrO3, Na2IrO3 and \u03b1-RuCl3 [15- 18].\nThe other strategy is the topochemical manipulations. Li-ions in \u03b1-Li2IrO3 or Na-ions in Na2IrO3 are wholly or partially replaced soft-chemically by other monovalent or divalent ions [19]. This manipulation tunes the entire lattice and produces changes in the ratio of J, K, and \u0393. Examples include delafossite-type Ag3LiIr2O6 [20], H3LiIr2O6 [21], Cu2IrO3 [22], and ilmenite-type MgIrO3, ZnIrO3, and CdIrO3 [23,24]. All delafossite-type compounds exhibit spin-liquid-like behavior [20-22]. However, the crystallographical disorder has been found to exist in all of them [25-27]. Thus, such a disorder can mimic a spin-liquid-like state without the dominant Kitaev interactions. In contrast, all ilmenite-type iridates exhibit magnetic ordering [23,24]. In addition, the antiferromagnetic interaction is dominant in all of them, likely representing a deviation from the pure Kitaev model. In parallel with this, three-dimensional (3D) analogs of the two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb of Ir4+ ions were discovered as another platform for Kitaev magnetism [28-30]. Examples include the \u201chyperhoneycomb\u201d lattice in \u03b2-Li2IrO3 [28, 29] and the \u201charmonic honeycomb\u201d lattice in \u03b3-Li2IrO3 [30] defined on several 3D tricoordinate lattices. The magnetic susceptibility of both compounds evidences the predominant ferromagnetic exchange interactions, likely indicating that the Kitaev-term is dominant. This origin is probably due to the more negligible effect of trigonal strain and stacking defects than the 2D system, originating from its 3D structure. Thus, the lattice tuning with the topochemical manipulation to the\nthree-dimensional Li2IrO3 polymorphs would effectively approach the pure Kitaev model for realizing the Kitaev QSL.\nIn this letter, we report on the successful synthesis of a hyperhoneycomb iridate \u03b2-ZnIrO3 via the topochemical reaction to \u03b2-Li2IrO3 as well as its structural, magnetic, and thermodynamic properties. The crystal structure analysis revealed the existence of a random distribution of nonmagnetic Zn ions. Nevertheless, no clear magnetic/glass transition or disorder-induced scaling behavior has been observed. These results indicate that the robustness of Kitaev QSL is strongly related to their dimensionality, which is probably due to the stability of the localized Z2-fluxes differing between 2D and 3D systems [31,32].\nExperimental Procedure. The precursor \u03b2-Li2IrO3 was prepared via the conventional solid-state reactions. Stoichiometric amounts of Li2CO3 and IrO2 were mixed, and the mixture was calcined at 1000\u00b0C for 24 h in air and then quenched. This precursor was ground well with a significant excess of ZnSO4 and an inert salt KCl in an Ar-filled glove box, sealed in an evacuated Pyrex tube, and reacted at 400\u00b0C for 100 h. The ion-exchange reaction is expressed as\n\u03b2-Li2IrO3 + ZnSO4 \u2192 \u03b2-ZnIrO3 + Li2SO4. (2)\nInitially, the synthesis using ZnCl2 as a common 2Li+\u2194Zn2+ ion-exchange reaction agent was attempted. However, after the reaction with ZnCl2, the Pyrex glass was filled with chlorine gas, suggesting the non-redox-neutral process. Thusobtained samples show significant sample dependence with a significant spin-glass-like contribution. Therefore, the valence of Ir is expected to be deviated from tetravalent in the sample obtained using ZnCl2. On the other hand, we found that the ion exchange reaction can be substituted using ZnSO4 instead of ZnCl2.This method does not produce chlorine gas naturally, and a redox-neutral reaction is expected. However, when only ZnSO4 was used as the ion-exchange reactant, the reaction rate was prolonged, and it was not easy to obtain a single-phase sample. In this study, we applied the method applied to the previously-reported ion-exchange reaction from ilmenite-type oxide NaSbO3 to rosiaite-type oxide ZnSb2O6 [33]. We succeeded in increasing the reaction rate by adding inert salt of KCl to lower the melting point and thus promote ion diffusion. In addition, the sample dependence of magnetization was negligible (see Supplemental Material [34]). Therefore, the reaction using ZnSO4/KCl mixture salt can be assumed to be a redox-neutral process. The remained salts were removed by washing the sample with distilled water.\nThe thus-obtained sample was characterized by powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments in a diffractometer with Cu-K\u03b1 radiation. The cell parameters and crystal structure were refined by the Rietveld method using the RIETAN-FP v2.16 software [35]. The temperature dependence of dc and ac magnetization was measured under several magnetic fields in a magnetic property measurement system (MPMS; Quantum Design) equipped at ISSP, the University of Tokyo. The ac measurements were performed with oscillating magnetic fields of Hac = 1 Oe at frequencies of 10, 100, and 1000 Hz. The temperature dependence of the heat capacity was measured using the conventional relaxation method in a\nphysical property measurement system (PPMS; Quantum Design) at ISSP, the University of Tokyo. Magnetization curves up to approximately 50 T were measured by an induction method with a multilayer pulsed magnet at the International MegaGauss Science Laboratory of the Institute for Solid State Physics at the University of Tokyo.\nResults. Figure 1(a) shows a powder XRD pattern of \u03b2-ZnIrO3. All peaks can be indexed to an orthorhombic unit cell with a = 5.92705 (3) \u00c5, b = 8.76465 (3) \u00c5, and c = 17.8315 (3) \u00c5 based on the space group of Fddd, which is the same of precursor \u03b2-Li2IrO3. The chemical composition was examined using energy dispersive x-ray spectrometry, yielding the ratio of Zn/Ir = 1.00(4). Thus, we concluded that the ion-exchange reaction is completed. The XRD pattern could not be reproduced by a model that the original Li+ octahedral sites are replaced by Zn2+ at half occupancy. Thus, we constructed an initial structure in which zinc ions occupy octahedral and tetrahedral sites. This Rietveld refinement converges well with\nthe crystal structure shown in Fig. 1(b). Table 1 shows the crystallographic parameters. Zn2+ ions occupy approximately half of the octahedral and half of the tetrahedral sites, respectively. Such a distribution of Zn ions is inevitably expected to generate randomness effects in the spin system.\nThere are two types of Ir-Ir bonds with different lengths, as shown in the left part of Fig. 1(c). One of the shorter Ir-Ir bonds of 2.984 \u00c5 forms a zig-zag chain (gray) linked by the longer Ir-Ir bonds of 3.077 \u00c5 (yellow) with alternating rotation by 68.13\u00ba around the c-axis. The difference between the two Ir-Ir bonds is ~3%, which is more anisotropic than the precursor \u03b2-Li2IrO3 (~0.2%) [28]. This non-equivalency of IrIr bonds also leads to the non-equivalence of Ir-O-Ir bond angles. The two bond angles in \u03b2-Li2IrO3 are almost equivalent (94.5\u00b0 and 94.7\u00b0), whereas those in \u03b2-ZnIrO3 are more deviated (94.1\u00b0 and 91.5\u00b0). The difference in the angle of the superexchange path should affect the magnetism.\nFigure 2(a) shows the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility \u03c7 and its inverse 1/\u03c7 measured at \u03bc0H = 1 T. The Curie-Weiss (CW) fit of the 1/\u03c7 data in the range of 200\u2013300 K yields an effective magnetic moment \u03bceff = 1.804(3) \u03bcB with a Weiss temperature \u03b8W = 45.2(6) K. The \u03bceff value evidences a Jeff = 1/2 pseudospin with a Lande\u2019s g-factor of g = 2.08. This enhancement is due to the spin-orbit interaction. The positive \u03b8W value indicates predominantly ferromagnetic interactions among the Jeff = 1/2 pseudospins, consistent with a Kitaevtype interaction. These parameters of \u03b2-ZnIrO3 are similar but slightly larger than those of \u03b2-Li2IrO3 (\u03bceff = 1.61 \u03bcB and \u03b8W = 40 K) [28]. In the low-temperature region of Fig. 2(a), the 1/\u03c7 curve gradually deviates from the CW line below approximately 120 K, suggesting the development of shortrange order (SRO). At lower temperatures, the \u03c7 data tend to saturate and approach a finite value with little magnetic field dependence, as shown in Fig. 2(b). At the lowest field of 10 mT, \u03c7 exhibits a slight thermal hysteresis between the zerofield-cooled and field-cooled data below Tg = 12 K, suggesting a trace of spin glass-like contribution. The difference, however, is less than 4% of the total magnetization at 2 K, and the glassy component becomes negligible at high magnetic fields above 1 T. Moreover, Fig. 2(c) displays the real part of the ac susceptibility, which shows no frequency dependence without an anomaly and is completely consistent with the dc susceptibility. Furthermore, samples synthesized using ZnCl2 instead of ZnSO4 show a large spin glass-like contribution with a substantial sample dependence (see Supplemental Material [34]). Thus, the glass-like behavior would originate from frozen minority spins or a trace of magnetic impurities.\nFig 3(a) shows the temperature dependence of the heat capacity divided by temperature C/T up to 250 K. There appears to be no anomaly indicating a long-range order not only at Tg [see also the inset of Fig. 3(a)] but also in all measured temperature range. The C/T versus T2 plot at low temperatures is shown in Fig. 3(b), where C/T exhibits linear dependence as a function of T2 with a finite intercept of \u03b3 = 5.31(7) mJ mol\u22121 K\u22122, which was obtained by fitting to the equation C/T = \u03b3 + \u03b2T2. The \u03b3-value is surprisingly independent of an applied magnetic field, strongly suggesting that the low energy spin excitation has nothing to do with the glassy contribution but derives from a QSL ground state.\nMagnetization measurements up to 51.5 T using pulsed magnetic fields were performed, as shown in Fig. 4. The magnetization M shows convex-upward-increasing with a tendency to saturate. However, the M value at 51.5 T is about 0.6 \u03bcB, much smaller than the saturated M ~ 1 \u03bcB expected in the Jeff = 1/2 spin. In the theoretical predictions about the Kitaev QSL, M eventually saturates at 1/2 \u03bcB owing to a significant spin fluctuation in the Kitaev paramagnetic state [37]. Therefore, this saturating behavior in \u03b2-ZnIrO3 may reflect the strong spin fluctuation. Moreover, the M data shows a slight increase at ~14 T, evidenced by an anomaly in its derivative dM/dH. In the present stage, there is no decisive proof of a phase transition from Kitaev QSL to a paramagnetic state as theoretically predicted [38, 39].\nDiscussion. As described above, \u03b2-ZnIrO3 is a spin-orbitcoupled Mott insulator with Jeff = 1/2 hyperhoneycomb lattice. Signatures of QSL have been observed despite the dominance of ferromagnetic interactions, likely representing the Kitaev model. Many issues, however, remain and should be tackled urgently.\nFirstly, randomness due to the irregular arrangement of Zn2+ ions should influence magnetism. This randomness possibly causes spin-glass transition or generation of free-spins. However, no physical properties have been observed to characterize the disordered system. Moreover, the lowtemperature heat capacity of \u03b2-ZnIrO3 is almost independent of the magnetic field despite randomness. In contrast, the strong magnetic field dependence in C/T and \u03c7 reproduced by scaling behavior has been observed in other Kitaev systems such as H3LiIr2O6, Cu2IrO3, and \u03b1-Ru0.8Ir0.2Cl3 [21, 40, 41]. The presence of quenched disorder theoretically explains well the scaling behavior of thermodynamic quantities [42]. These materials and \u03b2-ZnIrO3 would be in the category of Kitaev QSL, but their magnetic dimensionality is different\u20142D honeycomb and 3D hyperhoneycomb. Our observation indicates that the Kitaev QSL on the 3D lattice is essentially less affected by bond randomness. In the excited state of\nKitaev QSL, the localized Z2 fluxes are thermally excited in the form of closed loops [1,5-7]. Since the minimal p-sites closed-loop is different in 2D (p = 6) and 3D (p = 10), as shown in Figs. 5(a) and (b) [31,32], there would be a difference in the stability against randomness. As shown in Fig. 5(c), in the 2D Kitaev model, it is theoretically predicted that the effect of randomness will produce a larger flux with the 12-sites loop consisting of three hexagons [43]. The size effect of the flux as these excited states may be responsible for the difference in robustness to disturbance. Thus, it is plausible that the protective effect against randomness is hidden in the 3D Kitaev QSL, which will be clarified theoretically in the future.\nThe next question is whether or not the theoretically predicted double Cmag peak exists. In the pure Kitaev model, spins are thermally fractionalized into itinerant Majorana fermions and localized fluxes, which release entropy in the high and low-temperature regions, respectively, which results in generating a double-peak structure at TH and TL in Cmag [44]. However, in the theoretical calculation, the randomness effect on itinerant Majorana fermions and localized fluxes is different\u2014randomness hardly interferes with the entropy release of itinerant Majorana fermions; on the contrary, it significantly suppresses the entropy release of localized fluxes [43]. Thus, Cmag in \u03b2-ZnIrO3 may be affected by randomness, resulting in the smearing of the entropy release of the localized fluxes. Besides, a finite-temperature \u201cgas-liquid phase transition\u201d to QSL is predicted in the limited model with strong anisotropy (Kz >> Kx, Ky in the Kitaev Hamiltonian) in\nthe hyperhoneycomb lattice [45]. Unfortunately, attempts to separate the magnetic and phonon contributions were unsuccessful, given the absence of a suitable phonon reference for \u03b2-ZnIrO3. Therefore, the observation of fractionalization requires another probe that is not affected by phonon contributions. Furthermore, it has been predicted that the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation rate 1/T1 will show significant temperature changes at TH and TL [32]. Therefore, the NMR experiments on 17O-enriched \u03b2-ZnIrO3 would be a promising method to observe the fractionalization; it is an issue for future work.\nSummary. We have successfully synthesized a hyperhoneycomb lattice iridate \u03b2-ZnIrO3 via a topochemical reaction. Although some signatures of Kitaev QSL have been observed, there are still many unresolved issues\u2014some deviations from theoretical predictions can be identified. However, in contrast to the previous 2D Kitaev candidates, \u03b2ZnIrO3 shows certain robustness to randomness effects. Thus, although some problems are still to be solved, such as the protective effect against randomness, the present results likely suggest that \u03b2-ZnIrO3 is the promising candidate for 3D Kitaev QSL.\nThe authors thank Z.

As discussed in the main text, the samples synthesized with ZnCl2 showed strong sample dependence, while those synthesized with the mixed salt of ZnSO4 and KCl showed almost no sample dependence. As shown in Figure 2 in the supplementary information, there is no particular sample dependence on heat capacity. As mentioned in the main text, the ZnCl2 sample did not undergo a redoxneutral reaction, which may have changed the valence of Ir ions and caused a strong spin-glass due to electron or hole-doping. On the other hand, the trace amount of spin glassy contribution in the ZnSO4 samples may also be due to a slight change in Irvalence, as the complete redox-neutral reaction has not been realized. Hence, we can conclude that a trace amount of spin-glass contribution in the ZnSO4 samples is not intrinsic."
