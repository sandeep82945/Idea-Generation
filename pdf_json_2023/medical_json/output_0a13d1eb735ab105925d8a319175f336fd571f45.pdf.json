The target population (Chinese college students) and an expert panel assessed the face and content validity. After the final revision of the questionnaire, the participants (n = 229) were asked to complete the 24HMBQ twice to examine test-retest reliability. Convergent validity was evaluated using Spearman\u2019s rho, by comparing the 24HMBQ estimates of sleep, SB, and PA with results derived from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Adult Sedentary Behaviors Questionnaire in China (ASBQC), and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire - Short Form (IPAQ-SF).\nResults The 24HMBQ exhibited good face validity and high acceptability to respondents. Regarding content validity, the S-CVI/UA and S-CVI/Ave were 0.88 and 0.97, respectively. As indicated by ICC, the test-retest reliability was considered moderate to excellent, ranging from 0.68 to 0.97 (P < 0.01). Regarding the convergent validity, correlations were 0.32 for the duration of sleep per day, 0.33 for total time of physical activity per day, and 0.43 for the duration of sedentary behaviors per day.\nConclusion The 24HMBQ is a feasible questionnaire with suitable validity and moderate to excellent test-retest reliability of all items. It is a promising tool to investigate 24-hour movement behaviors of Chinese college students. The 24HMBQ can be administrated in epidemiological studies.\nKeywords 24-hour movement behaviors, Questionnaire, Reliability, Validity, College students"

            "text": "Over the past several decades, mounting evidence has suggested that high levels of physical activity (PA), low levels of sedentary behaviors (SB), and optimal sleep duration and quality are independently associated with various health benefits in all age groups [1\u20136]. PA, SB, and sleep are co-dependent since they are distributed within the 24-hour cycle, and a change in the time of one behavior leads to changes in the others [7]. Therefore, more and more researchers have changed to investigate the combined effects of PA, SB, and sleep on physical and mental health instead of examining individual behaviors [8\u201310]. Notably, the existing evidence sheds light on the importance of the combinations of the three behaviors on physical, mental, and cognitive health [8, 11\u201316]. Several countries have developed national 24-hour movement guidelines based on integrated perspectives [17\u201320]. However, different terms were used to describe the PA, SB, and sleep collectively in the literature, such as 24-hour movement behaviors [17], physical behaviors [21], time-use activity behaviors [22, 23], and 24-hour activity cycle [24]. To avoid confusion, we adopt the term \u201c24-hour movement behaviors\u201d to collectively describe PA, SB, and sleep in this study.\nIn order to further understand the 24-hour movement behaviors and their health implications, it is essential to develop validated and reliable instruments to assess 24-hour movement behaviors. In the existing studies of 24-hour movement behaviors, PA, SB, and sleep were either objectively measured by wearable devices (e.g., accelerometers) [25, 26] or subjectively measured by questionnaires and activity logs [27\u201329]. Although device-based objective measures generally have high validity and reliability [30, 31], the devices are costly, and a high adherence from the participants is required. Meanwhile, the wearable device-based measurements cannot capture the information on the domains of PA and types of SB. Recently, activity log-based methods are also used in some studies to capture the details of PA, SB, and sleep over the 24-hour cycle, such as the Act24 (Activities Completed over Time in 24\u00a0h) [32] and STAR24 (Screen Time and Activity Recall) [33]. However, this method is time-consuming and subject to recall bias, and it is not feasible to implement in large-scale epidemiological studies.\nIn contrast, self-report questionnaires have advantages in reducing the burden on participants and researchers, lower costs, and feasibility [34]. Therefore, questionnaires are still commonly used in health surveillance systems [35]. However, questionnaires for assessing 24-hour movement behaviors are still sparse. Recently, Song and colleagues developed a 24-hour movement behaviors questionnaire for youth in South Korea [36]. It considers the unique lifestyle and environmental characteristics of\nKorean adolescents (e.g., the college entrance examination-oriented education system). Besides, Kastelic et al. developed the Daily Activity Behaviors Questionnaire (DABQ) for estimating the time spent on sleep, SB, and PA for adults [37]. The DABQ is designed to assess occupational, commuting, and other non-occupational SB and physical activity. Thus, they are not suitable for college students.\nThe college years are a developmental transition period from late adolescence to emerging adulthood [38]. Promoting college students\u2019 lifestyles and health has attracted great interest worldwide. According to the latest statistics, the number of Chinese college students in 2021 has reached 9.09\u00a0million [39]. Therefore, studying 24-hour movement behaviors and their associations with health indicators among college students is important. This information helps create specific lifestyle and health intervention strategies. Unlike in other countries, in China, almost all college students live in dormitories on campus and spend most of their time there. Therefore, developing a specific questionnaire suitable for Chinese college students is necessary.\nThis study aimed to develop a 24-hour movement behaviors questionnaire for Chinese college students that can be used in large-scale epidemiological studies and examine its reliability and validity."

The following criteria for inclusion were applied: (1) studies should measure PA, SB, and/or sleep; (2) the study should utilize a self-reported questionnaire; and (3) the properties (e.g., reliability and validity) of the questionnaire should be evaluated. The followings were the criteria for exclusion: (1) studies designed to test the effects of certain exercise intervention programs; (2) studies limited to specific demographic categories, such as overweight and/ or obese individuals, athletes, or disabled individuals.\nSecond, the following data were retrieved: (1) the items regarding PA, SB, and sleep; (2) the recall length required for the questionnaire; (3) the different dimensions measurement of PA (e.g., frequency, intensity, and domain); (4) the format of the questionnaire and the number of items; (5) the evaluation methods for reliability and validity; (6) other details of the questionnaire, such as sample size, test-retest interval, data analysis methods, and data comparison measurements, etc.\nItems were generated by categorizing and selecting the indicators of 24-hour movement behaviors based on the items of the existing relevant questionnaires. According to the fundamental principles and primary structural requirements of the questionnaire design, the initial version included the demographic information, sleep duration (eight items), duration of different types of SB (six items), the interruption time boundaries of SB (two items), and duration of different domains of PA (nineteen items).\nFinally, the initial version of the 24HMBQ was critically evaluated using the Delphi Method. The Delphi Method is considered a reliable measurement instrument for developing new concepts and setting the direction of future-orientated research [40]. This method assesses the extent of agreement and the importance of each issue by seeking the opinions of an expert panel [41]. The expert panel was asked to independently rate all items across three domains using a 5-point Likert scale (\u201cnot at all important,\u201d \u201cnot important,\u201d \u201caverage,\u201d \u201crelatively important,\u201d and \u201cvery important\u201d) [42]. The coefficient of variation (CV) indicates the degree of experts\u2019 divergences on the indicator\u2019s importance, the calculation formula\u2019s rationality, and the collection method\u2019s operability. Usually, CV < 0.25 indicates acceptable divergences [41]. Based on the expert panel\u2019s evaluations and suggestions, the initial version of the 24HMBQ was further revised."

            "text": "This study described the development of a comprehensive questionnaire that could be used to assess the 24-hour movement behaviors of Chinese college students. The development process followed a sequence of standardized steps. Its validity and reliability were examined. The 24HMBQ consists of thirty-three items, which showed suitable face validity, content validity, test-retest reliability, and convergent validity.\nThe 24HMBQ was developed based on the literature and expert review. Meanwhile, the target population (Chinese college students) and an expert panel of the 24HMBQ were invited to assess the face and content validity. The expert review process offered suggestions; but, no significant changes to items of the 24HMBQ were requested. The result indicated that the researchers and the expert panel consistently understood the items for 24-hour movement behaviors. Regarding content validity, the S-CVI/UA and S-CVI/Ave were 0.88 and 0.97, respectively, confirming that no meaningful activity items were missing and that all included items were relevant.\nSimilarly, the cognitive interview results did not lead to significant adjustments. However, the participants\u2019 understanding of some items deviated from the original intent of the researchers. The wording of ambiguous items was modified. In general, the 24HMBQ has good face validity and is highly acceptable to the participants.\nThe test-retest reliability of the 24HMBQ was moderate to excellent (ICC ranging from 0.69 to 0.98) for all items, which is higher than the test-retest reliability of the DABQ (ICC ranging from 0.59 to 0.69) [37]. This result may be because 24HMBQ was designed for Chinese college students\u2019 everyday lifestyle and behavior, thus making the questions more detailed and accurate. The test-retest reliability of PA in daily exercise showed the highest reliability among the three domains, followed by PA in daily dormitory life and PA in daily transportation. This result may be because self-reports of PA rely on the participants\u2019 memory and response tendencies [42]. Existing studies point out that when people are asked to recall frequent daily behaviors (e.g., PA in daily dormitory life or daily transportation), they are less able to recall specific details of many events [61]. Participants who involved in the cognitive interview indicated that sports and exercise were done less frequently and primarily in PE classes, so they could easily recall these. In contrast, the remaining two domains of PA were conducted every day but with unpredictable frequency and duration, making it difficult to recollect them. As a result, the participants must rely on estimation and inference strategies to provide reports. Even so, the retest reliability (0.74\u20130.80) was still higher than some PA questionnaires, such as Global physical activity questionnaire (GPAQ) [42]. Generally, the 24HMBQ estimations of the time\nTable 3 Test-retest reliability for the questionnaire by categories\nVariable Type Round 1 a Round 2 a Rho b ICC c SLP(h/d)d Weekday 8.61 \u00b1 1.36 8.70 \u00b1 1.39 0.64** 0.80 (0.74\u2013 0.84)\nWeekend 9.79 \u00b1 1.77 9.80 \u00b1 1.71 0.65** 0.74 (0.67\u2013 0.80)\nSB (h/d)e Weekday 11.18 \u00b1 3.96 11.11 \u00b1 4.23 0.68** 0.80 (0.74\u2013 0.85)\nWeekend 10.57 \u00b1 3.55 10.55 \u00b1 3.99 0.51** 0.65 (0.55\u2013 0.73)\nPA (h/d)f Daily exercise (including workout, PE class, etc.) 1.59 \u00b1 1.83 1.60 \u00b1 1.83 0.69** 0.80 (0.74\u2013 0.85)\nDaily transportation 0.95 \u00b1 1.05 0.99 \u00b1 1.12 0.63** 0.74 (0.66\u2013 0.80)\nDaily dormitory life 0.62 \u00b1 0.68 0.64 \u00b1 0.75 0.73** 0.74 (0.67\u2013 0.80)\nTotal duration (h/d)g 23.11 \u00b1 3.18 23.19 \u00b1 3.99 0.59** 0.69 (0.59\u2013 0.76)\n**P < 0.01 for all correlations between test and retest a Mean \u00b1 Standard deviation (SD); b Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficient (Rho); c ICC (95% CI); d Calculated by time to bed and wake-up time; e Calculated by the sum of any sitting and/or lying down activities; f Calculated by the sum of duration to do light-intensity physical activity (LPA),\u00a0moderate-intensity physical activity (MPA)\u00a0 and vigorous-intensity physical activity (VPA); g Calculated by the sum of duration of sleep, SB and PA"

There is acceptable convergent validity in the duration of sleep, sedentary behaviors, and the total time of physical activity.\nTo the best of our knowledge, the 24HMBQ is among the first questionnaires with good validity and reliability for Chinese college students to assess movement behaviors over a 24-hour period. A key strength of the 24HMBQ is the rigorous methods with which it was developed. The phases of expert review, cognitive interview, and content validity test were crucial for reducing reporting errors by ensuring that items and instructions were suitably worded for Chinese college students. Meanwhile, the 24HMBQ enables assessments of sleep and SB on weekdays and weekends, the frequency of breaking SB, the duration of engagement in specific SB types (i.e., study, work, electronic screen-based devices for entertainment), different domains of PA (i.e., daily exercise, daily transportation, daily dormitory life), and the frequency of muscle strength training. Therefore, the 24HMBQ can capture more multidimensional information about PA, SB and sleep, which cannot be obtained by objective measurements.\nIt is practically important to develop the 24HMBQ to provide valuable information about a complete picture of college student\u2019s 24-hour movement behaviors. The questionnaire could be used to investigate the profile of PA, SB and sleep, the joint and independent associations of PA, SB and sleep with physical and mental health indicators in college students. Furthermore, the 24HMBQ is capable to capture the domain-specific physical activity and different types of sedentary behaviors, which can provide more specific recommendations for the development of interventions can promote health-related behaviors.\nHowever, the 24HMBQ is not without limitations. The questionnaire is designed to measure 24-hour movement behaviors among college students. Therefore, the generalization of 24HMBQ to other age groups is limited. In addition, this questionnaire was developed in Chinese context; therefore, it may not be directly used in other countries due to the different culture. Last, although the convergent validity was assessed in the study, the criterion validity should be evaluated by using objective measures of movement behaviors in future studies."
