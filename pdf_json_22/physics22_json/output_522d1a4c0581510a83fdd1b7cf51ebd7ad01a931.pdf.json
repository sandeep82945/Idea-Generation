The EHT 2017 campaign as yielded total intensity images of the shadow of the black hole at he centre of M87 at 230 GHz (Event Horizon Telescope Collaboraion 2019a , d , f ). Assuming statistically preferred geometric crescent odels and general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) odels, measurements of physical properties such as the diameter f the shadow (42 \u00b1 3 \u03bcas) and angular size of one gravitational adius (3 . 8 \u00b1 0 . 4 \u03bcas) hav e been obtained (Ev ent Horizon Telescope ollaboration 2019d , e , f ). These measurements correspond to a mass f 6.5 \u00b1 0.7 \u00d7 10 9 M at the estimated distance 16 . 8 + 0 . 8 \u22120 . 7 Mpc (Event orizon Telescope Collaboration 2019f ), consistent with prior mass easurements based on stellar dynamics (Gebhardt et al. 2011 ). Synthetic data play a significant role in understanding the charcteristics of an instrument, de veloping ne w algorithms for data nalysis, and realistically representing the underlying physics that ive rise to the observed data. Feasibility studies and identification f new sites for upgrading existing arrays such as the EHT, the Karl G ansky Very Large Array (VLA) (Perley et al. 2011 ), European VLBI etwork (EVN) (Porcas 2010 ), East Asian VLBI Network (EAVN) An, Sohn & Imai 2018 ), the Atacama Large Millimeter Array ALMA) (Matthews et al. 2018 ; Goddi et al. 2019 ), and MeerKAT Jonas 2009 ), and for building new arrays such as the next-generation HT (ngEHT) (Blackburn et al. 2019 ), the next-generation VLA ngVLA) (Selina et al. 2018 ), and the Square Kilometre Array SKA) (e.g. Schilizzi et al. 2007 ) can benefit greatly from realistic imulations of interferometric observations. These benefits include redictive analyses of new hardware enhancements, as well as esting and optimization of calibration and imaging algorithms and ipelines. Powerful analyses can be performed by the average user hen the synthetic data tools are user-friendly and can be seamlessly ntegrated with the calibration and analysis tools. MEQSV2 has been esigned with this as a guiding principle. Roelofs et al. ( 2020 ) provide a brief re vie w of the various synthetic ata generation approaches used for simulating EHT observations v er the past decade. Most of these incorporate thermal noise arising rom the characteristics of the instrument and the atmosphere as he only data corruption effect. More complex signal corruptions re introduced by EHT-IMAGING (Chael et al. 2016 , 2018 ) and EQSILHOUETTE (Blecher et al. 2017 , and this paper), the two ynthetic data generation packages used for generating synthetic M87 bservations in Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration ( 2019a ), vent Horizon Telescope Collaboration ( 2019d ). EHT-IMAGING can introduce randomly varying complex gains nd ele v ation-dependent atmospheric opacity corruptions, and also imulates scattering due to the interstellar medium (ISM), which f fects observ ations of Sgr A \u2217 (Johnson 2016 ; Johnson et al. 2018 ). nstrumental polarization is introduced using previous measurements f leakage characteristics of the EHT antennas (Johnson et al. 2015 ) nd the antenna gains are generated as random offsets sampled from normal distribution with a standard deviation that is within a fixed ercentage of the visibility amplitudes of actual EHT data. EHTMAGING also adds randomized station-dependent inter-scan phases, hat are kept coherent within a single scan to mimic the phases of ringe-fitted visibilities.\nMEQSILHOUETTE takes a complementary approach to synthetic ata generation by introducing corruptions based on physical models nd tuned to match empirical station measurements. It was designed o adapt the simulation and calibration techniques developed for etre and cm-wavelength observations to mm-VLBI observations. he version presented in Blecher et al. ( 2017 ) could simulate\nimple Gaussian sources and narrow-field comple x sk y models and ntroduce physically-moti v ated tropospheric phase and amplitude orruptions, interstellar scattering using SCATTERBRANE 1 (Johnson & winn 2015 ), and time-variable antenna pointing errors. It has been ignificantly enhanced since then, first in step with the publication f the first results from 2017 EHT observations, and then with the evelopment of SYMBA (Roelofs et al. 2020 ) and the first polarimetric esults of the 2017 M87 observations (Event Horizon Telescope ollaboration 2021a , b ). MEQSILHOUETTE V2 (hereafter MEQSV2 2 ) introduces full polarietric, time-variable, spectrally resolved synthetic data generation nd corruption capabilities and is capable of handling wide-field ource models with complex substructures. MEQSV2 has been rewriten and expanded from Blecher et al. ( 2017 ). The code has been efactored to be fully compatible with the same pipelines used or the analysis of real EHT data. The pointing and atmospheric odels have been rewritten to include more sophisticated effects. ource and instrumental polarization simulation capabilities have een introduced. MEQSV2 also accounts for the effects of bandwidth n various propagation path effects at mm-wavelengths. These eatures facilitate a variety of studies for both the EHT and upcoming LBI arrays, such as performing rotation measure (RM) synthesis tudies (Brentjens & de Bruyn 2005 ) and multi-frequency synthesis maging with the increasing fractional bandwith of the EHT, as well s the envisioned multi-band imaging at 230 GHz and 345 GHz or the ngEHT. The ability to vary instrumental polarization across he receiver bandwidth is crucial to take full advantage of ultraideband receivers and high dynamic-range polarimetric imaging. ith the polarimetric primary beam module, full Stokes primary eam modelling for upcoming arrays such as the ngEHT can be ndertaken. Roelofs et al. ( 2020 ) seamlessly combines the functionlity of MEQSV2 and RPICARD (Janssen et al. 2019 ), the CASA -based LBI pipeline for calibrating data from the EHT and other VLBI acilities. Synthetic data generated by both EHT-IMAGING and SYMBA , epresenting complementary approaches, have been found to be onsistent with each other (Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration 019d ). In this paper, we present the components of MEQSV2 and illusrate its simulation capabilities. In particular, we illustrate the new olarimetric and spectral resolution capabilities using synthetic data nd validate them. We study the effects of bandpass gains on closure uantities, which can limit or bias constraints on intrinsic source tructure asymmetry, by generating synthetic data with realistic andpasses. The polarimetric capabilities of MEQSV2 are validated sing POLSOLVE , a CASA task developed for polarization calibration f VLBI observations (Mart \u0301\u0131-Vidal et al. 2021 ). Unlike conventional LBI polarimetric calibration software packages such as LPCAL Leppanen, Zensus & Diamond 1995 ) that use a linear approximation o model polarization leakage, POLSOLVE uses a non-linear model erived from the full RIME to handle high leakage values for pecialized cases such as the EHT. In addition, POLSOLVE uses a ombined multi-source model when the parallactic angle co v erage or individual calibrators is limited and can model the frequencyependence of the leakage terms for calibrating large fractional andwidths. This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a brief v erview of the RIME formalism that forms the basis of how\nMNRAS 512, 490\u2013504 (2022)\nM\nM t M i t d t o S c S M\n2 M\nH m ( S d b t\nv y\nV\nw f fi t\nV\nw J i\na ( 2\n2\nB b t\na\n3\nm 2 4\n(\nm\nw\ni r t c\nV\nw\ni a a\n3\nM f f t i h t b c c i i s v t a s c\nb i s V e p a c e ( s\nT\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/512/1/490/6537429 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nEQSV2 models visibilities to make this a self-contained publicaion.

Here we provide only a rief summary of the rele v ant aspects of this formalism and, given he range of notations in use, establish the notation used in this paper.\nAn interferometer produces four pairwise correlations between the oltage vectors from two stations p and q (each with two feeds x and ), that can be arranged into the 2 \u00d7 2 visibility matrix 3 :\npq = 2 (\u3008 v px v \u2217qx \u3009 \u3008 v px v \u2217qy \u3009 \u3008 v py v \u2217qx \u3009 \u3008 v py v \u2217qy \u3009 ) , (1)\nhere the angled brackets denote averaging over some small time and requency bin, based on considerations of smearing and decoherence , eld of interest, and processing requirements. In terms of the voltage wo-vectors v p , equation ( 1 ) can be represented as\npq = 2 \u2329(\nv px v py\n)( v \u2217qx , v \u2217 qy )\u232a = 2 \u3008 v p v H q \u3009 , = 2 \u3008 J p e ( J q e ) H \u3009 = 2 \u3008 J p ( e e H ) J H q \u3009 , (2)\nhere e is the incoming electromagnetic wave, J p are the 2 \u00d7 2 ones matrices that describe any linear transformation acting on the ncoming wave, and H is the Hermitian conjugate. The matrix product\ne e H in equation ( 2 ) is related to the four Stokes parameters I , Q , U , nd V that describe the polarization state of electromagnetic radiation Hamaker et al. 1996 ; Thompson, Moran & George W. Swenson 017 ) by the following relation 4 :\n(\u3008 e x e \u2217x \u3009 \u3008 e x e \u2217y \u3009 \u3008 e y e \u2217x \u3009 \u3008 e y e \u2217y \u3009 ) = ( I + Q U + iV U \u2212 iV I \u2212 Q ) \u2261 B .

In the presence of multiple discrete sources in he sky, taking into account the direction-dependence of the source oherency and some Jones matrices, the RIME generalizes to\npq = G p ( \u2211\ns\nE sp X spq E H sq ) G H q , (5)\nhere the summation is carried out o v er all the sources and E sp and G p denote generic direction-dependent effects (DDEs) and directionndependent effects (DIEs) respectively. MEQSV2 does not simulate ny DDEs for EHT observations, since, aside from scattering, there re no major DDEs that occur along the signal path.\nT H E MEQSI LHOUETTE F R A M E WO R K\nEQSV2 was designed to use the Measurement Set 5 (MS), a database ormat designed to store radio astronomical data in next-generation acilities such as JVLA, ALMA, MeerKAT, and SKA. Fig. 1 shows he basic layout and the components of a typical MEQSV2 run. Scatterng by the ISM is not applied to the input sky models and is assumed to ave been applied externally, simplifying the user interface compared o v1. MEQSV2 uses a driver script to set up the sequence of steps to e e x ecuted to generate the synthetic data. The fr ame work module ontains the various functions necessary to create synthetic data, orrupt them, and optionally generate additional data products. The nputs to the driver script are presented as attribute-value pairs in a file n the JSON format (Crockford 2006 ) containing information on the ource, weather, and antenna parameters necessary for computing arious components of the RIME. The Jones matrices are applied o the uncorrupted visibilities in the order in which they occur long the signal path (Noordam & Smirnov 2010 ), unless they are calar, in which case they can be applied anywhere along the signal hain.\nAdvanced users may write their own driver scripts to tailor the asic strate gy pro vided by MEQSV2 for their own needs. For instance, n SYMBA (Roelofs et al. 2020 ), we use this framework to create ynthetic data that follow real EHT observing schedules using input EX 6 files (the scheduling protocol for VLBI experiments) and xtend the pointing offset module to compute short and long-term ointing offsets mimicking the behaviour of EHT stations. SYMBA lso performs additional a priori calibration so that the output more losely resembles the uncalibrated EHT data. MEQSV2 can just as asily be used for simulating observations with other VLBI arrays see Section 5 ), although other propagation path effects that become ignificant at longer wavelengths may need to be implemented.\nThe following subsections explain the various modules of MEQSV2 . he plots shown are obtained using a hypothetical 12-h observing\nun using the EHT2017 array listed in Table 1 at an observing freuency of 230 GHz towards M87 ( \u03b1J2000 = 12 h 30 m 49 s . 42 , \u03b4J2000 = 2 \u25e623 \u2032 28 \u2032\u2032 . 04).

Since imges are gridded representations of the sky, we use WSCLEAN , a ast generic widefield imager (Offringa et al. 2014 ), to Fouriernvert the model image to the uv -plane. Each polarized, time nd frequency variable image frame is F ourier-inv erted into the ppropriate subset of the generated MS. 7 Parametric sky models re handled by MEQTREES (Noordam & Smirnov 2010 ), which erforms a direct Fourier transform of the sky model into the S. For the EHT, the visibilities are al w ays computed in the circular olarization basis (RR, RL, LR, and LL), except in the case of LMA which records signals in linear basis. In MEQSV2 , we assume hat the ALMA visibilities have been perfectly converted to circular olarization (Marti-Vidal et al. 2015 ) so that the basis is uniform\nThe naming conventions for the image frames are explained in the official ocumentation.\na d c\ns\ncross all stations.

The scatter of the visibilities is due o thermal noise. The capability to simulate time-varying sources is articularly useful for simulating sources exhibiting variability on imescales of minutes to hours, such as the radio source associated ith the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A \u2217 (or Sgr A \u2217) located t the Galactic centre (e.g. Lu et al. 2016 ). In addition, studies on ecoupling time-varying instrumental effects from source evolution ould be undertaken.\nFig. 3 shows the stokes I visibilities of a point source with a steep pectral index, across a 2 GHz bandwidth divided into 64 channels,\nMNRAS 512, 490\u2013504 (2022)\nM\nc t d\n3\nS r a t a i a\nb (\nE\nw p v h p d v i i\nd o e o t p\nw\nT 2 i\nFigure 4.

The data shown correspond to a 5-min subset of he entire observation for all channels. As before, the scatter seen is ue to thermal noise. .2 Antenna pointing errors everal factors cause antennas to mispoint and modify its gain esponse, such as differential flexure of the antenna, wind pressure, nd thermal e xpansion. Moreo v er, errors in drive mechanics or the elescope control software also introduce pointing errors, which ttenuate the measured visibility amplitudes, | V pq | . Even small offsets n antenna pointing can cause significant reduction in visibility mplitudes at mm-wavelengths. Formulated in terms of the RIME, this effect is represented y a time and direction-dependent antenna-based E-Jones matrix Smirnov 2011b ): p ( l, m ) = E( l + \u03b4l p , m + \u03b4m p ) , (7) here \u03b4l and \u03b4m are the time-variable offsets in the lm -plane. MEQSV2 ro vides a WSRT-deriv ed analytic cos 3 beam (from the previous ersion) and a Gaussian primary beam profile. The Gaussian profile as the advantage that it can be conveniently described by a single arameter, the full width at half maximum (FWHM), and does not eviate from the more complex Bessel function from the centre up to ery close to the first null (Middelberg et al. 2013 ). This assumption s justified in the context of EHT, since, in most cases, the field of nterest is much smaller than the location of the first null. The offsets per pointing epoch (or scan) for station p , \u03c1p , are rawn from the normal distribution N (0 , P rms ,p ). P rms values depend n station and weather characteristics and are determined based on mpirical measurements. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) f the primary beam P FWHM ,p of each antenna at 230 GHz is scaled o the centre frequency of the observation. The beam model with the ointing errors is given by\nE p = exp (\n\u2212 1 2\n[ \u03c1p\n( P FWHM ,p / 2 \u221a 2 ln 2 )\n]2 ) ,\nhere \u03c1p = \u221a \u03b4l 2 p + \u03b4m 2 p . (8) he 2 \u221a 2 ln 2 factor arises due to the relationship FWHM =\n\u221a 2 ln 2 \u03c3 , where \u03c3 is the standard deviation.

The corresponding E-Jones matrix is given y\np = (\nE pa ( l, m ) 0 0 E pb ( l, m )\n) . (9)\nhis is implemented as a scalar term ( E pa = E pb ) that can commute ith other components of the RIME. Fig. 4 shows an example simulation of pointing offsets, \u03c1p , and ow they affect the primary beam response of the EHT2017 antennas. MA is the least af fected o wing to its large beam size, while LMT s the most affected due its narrow primary beam.\n.3 Tropospheric effects\nhe troposphere has a significant effect on signal propagation at m wavelengths (Carilli & Holdaway 1999 ). MEQSV2 models three\nignificant tropospheric effects \u2013 (i) the signal attenuation due to tmospheric opacity \u03c4 , (ii) the increased system temperature due to tmospheric emission at the sky brightness temperature T sky , and (iii) he phase fluctuations due to atmospheric turbulence. These effects re separated into mean and turbulent components, with the mean omponent further divided into wet (due to water vapor) and dry omponents. A detailed treatment of the propagation fundamentals an be found in Blecher et al. ( 2017 ). Here we provide a summary long with the updated equations and algorithms implemented in EQSV2 .\n.3.1 Mean troposphere\nt mm-wavelengths, the mean component of the troposphere causes ignal attenuation due to absorption and time delays, along with a seudo-continuum opacity that increases with frequency. The H 2 O nd O 2 lines cause significant absorption abo v e 100 GHz, peaking n the THz regime (Thompson et al. 2017 ). MEQSV2 retains the se of the Atmospheric Transmission at Microwaves ( ATM , Pardo, ernicharo & Serabyn 2001 ) software from Blecher et al. ( 2017 ) o compute the mean opacity, sky noise, and the mean component f the delays. ATM implements radiative transfer through a static tmosphere. In the absence of scattering, the radiative transfer quation for unpolarized radiation is given by\nd I \u03bd( s)\nd s = \u03bd( s) \u2212 \u03ba\u03bd( s ) I \u03bd( s ) , (10)\nFigure 5.

The absorption coefficient \u03ba\u03bd is calculated as a function f frequency and altitude, enabling equation ( 10 ) to be integrated long the signal path to obtain mean opacity and sky brightness emperature. An example of the ele v ation-dependent transmission for ALMA nd LMT o v er a 7-h observing track towards the direction of M87 is hown in Fig. 5 . The mean time delay is obtained from the absorption oefficient using the Kramers-Kr \u0308onig relations (e.g. de L. Kronig 926 ), for which the necessary atmospheric temperature and pressure rofiles are calculated based on site-dependent precipitable water apour (PWV) depth and ground temperature and pressure (Pardo t al. 2001 ). The a priori correlator model used by the EHT corrects for various ffects including the elevation-dependent variations in the intra-scan elays (Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration 2019b ). Optionally, EQSV2 simulates this correction by introducing a constant residual elay per scan, that is equal to the mean delay averaged over all requency channels. Integrating equation ( 10 ) also yields sky brightness temperature, hich contributes to an increase in the system temperature. The esultant increase in the sky noise is implemented as an opacity and le v ation-dependent noise component. This noise, along with the hermal noise component, is accounted for in the total noise budget sed for visibility weighting in MEQSV2 (see Section 3.6 ). .3.2 Turbulent troposphere urbulence in the troposphere introduces phase instabilities in the easured visibilities. The spatial distribution of water vapor in the\nroposphere evolves rapidly, reducing the coherence timescale to 10 s (Thompson et al. 2017 ). This limits the coherent averaging ime (and hence the S/N) of uncalibrated visibilities, and renders onventional calibration procedures (with interleaved observations f calibrator and target source) inef fecti ve. Self-calibration is also imited by the S/N required for fringe-fitting.\nMEQSV2 models these phase variations, \u03b4\u03c6( t , \u03bd), by assuming a hin, Kolmogorov-turbulent phase screen moving with constant veocity (e.g. Johnson & Gwinn 2015 ). This method is applicable to any ituation in which the troposphere induces delays in electromagnetic\nave propagation (e.g. Treuhaft & Lanyi 1987 ). The phase offsets ntroduced can be described by the phase structure function given by Carilli & Holdaway 1999 )\n\u03c6( x , x \u2032 ) = \u3008 [ \u03c6( x + x \u2032 ) \u2212 \u03c6( x )] 2 \u3009 , (11) here x and x \u2032 are points on the screen and the angled brackets denote\nnsemble average. This equation can be reasonably approximated by power law (e.g. Armstrong, Rickett & Spangler 1995 ):\n\u03c6( r) \u2248 ( r\nr 0\n)\u03b2 , (12)\nhere r 2 = ( x \u2212 x \u2032 ) 2 and r 0 is the phase coherence scale at which \u03c6( r 0 ) = 1 rad . Scattering can be classified as strong or weak based on the rela-\nionship between r 0 and the Fresnel scale, r F , defined as \u221a\n\u03bbD os / 2 \u03c0 , here D os is the distance between the observer and the scattering\ncreen. The radiative power measured at a given point originates rom a single region of area A weak = \u03c0r 2 F when r F r 0 and from ultiple disconnected zones each of area A strong = \u03c0r 2 0 when r F 0 (Narayan 1992 ). Empirical estimates of r 0 fall in the range of 50 \u2212 500 m abo v e Mauna Kea (Masson 1994 ) and \u223c90 \u2212700 m bo v e Chajnantor (Radford & Holdaway 1998 ). At \u03bb = 1.3 mm and os = 2 km (the water vapor scale height), r F \u2248 0.64 m ( r 0 ), and ence scattering falls under the weak regime. Equation ( 12 ) may be rewritten with explicit time-dependence s D \u03c6( t) = D \u03c6( r) | r= v t , where v is the bulk transverse velocity of he phase screen (Coulman 1985 ). Assuming that the coherence imescale when observing towards the zenith, t c = r 0 / | v | (Treuhaft & anyi 1987 ; Blecher et al. 2017 ), we get\n\u03c6( t) \u2248 ( t\nt c\n)\u03b2 . (13)\noth Kolmogorov theory and empirical measurements show that he exponent \u03b2 should be equal to 5/3 when r < h , where h s the thickness of the turbulent layer which is \u223c1 km (Carilli & oldaway 1997 ). The processed Field-of-View (FoV) of the EHT is bout 100 \u00d7 100 \u03bcas 2 and is much smaller than r 0 , allowing us to epresent it as a diagonal Jones matrix in the RIME.\nThe antenna-based turbulent phase errors manifest as a series of orrelated, normally distributed random variables in time. This timeeries, { \u03b4\u03c6 \u2032 ( t ) } , can be constructed as follows (e.g. Rasmussen &\nilliams 2006 ). From the structure function D we construct the ovariance matrix . Since is symmetric and positive definite, the ower triangular matrix, L , resulting from the Cholesky decomposiion of (where = LL T ) can be applied to a time-series of the esired length with zero mean and unit variance to arrive at correlated andom samples.\nWe assume a simple linear scaling with frequency across the andwidth since the wet dispersive path delay is not more than a ew per cent of the non-dispersive component at mm-wavelengths Curtis et al. 2009 ). Also taking into account the airmass towards he horizon when observing away from the zenith, the phase error ime-series for antenna p becomes\n\u03b4\u03c6p ( t, \u03bd) } = 1 \u221a sin ( \u03b8el ( t) ) { \u03b4\u03c6\u2032 p ( t) } ( \u03bd \u03bd0 ) , (14)\nhere \u03bd is the list of channel frequencies, \u03bd0 is the reference requency, taken to be the lowest channel frequency, and \u03b8 el is the le v ation angle.\nSince VLBI stations are typically located hundreds or thousands f kilometres from each other, the tropospheric corruptions o v er ndividual stations are uncorrelated with each other and must be\nMNRAS 512, 490\u2013504 (2022)\nM\ns b i b H s s\n3\nT p o f e 1 r m\n3\nT a a r s a\n\u03c7\nw a a e f a\nw\nI r\nP\nF t d f d\n3\nT o D a t ( m\nFigure 6.

This is not strictly true for the shortaseline pairs of ALMA-APEX (2.6 km) and JCMT-SMA (160 m) n the EHT, for which the turbulence may be correlated since the aseline lengths are so short as to be comparable to r 0 (e.g. Carilli & oldaway 1997 ). Currently, intra-site baseline correlations are not imulated and the phase errors are generated independently for these tations.\n.4 Instrumental polarization\nhe two polarization feeds nominally measure two orthogonal olarization states of the incoming wave, in either circular (RL) r linear (XY) bases. In practice, mechanical imperfections in the eed or electronic imperfections in the signal path cause signals from ach independent signal path to leak into the other (Hamaker et al. 996 ; Sault, Hamaker & Bregman 1996 ). Additionally, the possible otation of the feeds by the parallactic angle depending on the antenna ount type must be taken into account.\n.4.1 Parallactic angle rotation\nhe mount type of the antenna determines the rotation of the feeds s seen from the sky (e.g. Dodson 2009 ). For equatorially mounted ntennas, the orientation of the primary beam with respect to the sky emains static. For alt-az mounted antennas, the beam rotates as the ource is tracked o v er the sky, and the feeds rotate by the parallactic ngle ( \u03c7\npa ) given by\npa = arctan\n( sin ( ) cos ( l) cos ( \u03b4) sin ( l) \u2212 cos ( ) cos ( l) sin ( \u03b4) ) , (15)\nhere is the h angle, \u03b4 is the Declination, and l is the latitude. For lt-az mounted antennas with Nasmyth focus, the more generic feed ngle ( \u03c7\np ) is used in place of parallactic angle, which incorporates the\nle v ation of the antenna. Depending on whether the tertiary mirror ocuses the light to the right or to the left, the ele v ation angle ( \u03c7\nel ) is\ndded or subtracted respectively,\n\u03c7 p = \u03c7 pa \u00b1 \u03c7 el ,\nhere \u03c7 el = arcsin ( sin ( l) sin ( \u03b4) + cos ( l) cos ( \u03b4) cos ( ) ). (16) n terms of Jones calculus, the P-Jones matrix for parallactic angle otation for circular polarization is given by (e.g. Hales 2017 )\np = (\ne \u2212j\u03c7p 0 0 e j\u03c7p\n) . (17)\nig. 6 shows the evolution of the parallactic angle corresponding to he EHT stations listed in Table 1 o v er the course of 12 hs towards the irection of M87. The parallactic angle values of the short baselines ormed by (i) JCMT-SMA and (ii) ALMA-APEX evolve similarly ue to the proximity of these stations to each other.\n.4.2 Polarization leaka g e\nhe two receptors in the feed are designed to be sensitive to rthogonal polarization states. Ideally, the D-Jones terms (or the -terms ) corresponding to polarization leakage is represented by unit matrix, expressed in the appropriate coordinate system (i.e. hat of the two polarization states measured by the feed receptors) Hamaker et al. 1996 ). In practice, the non-diagonal terms of this atrix are non-zero, due to the fact that each receptor is sensitive\nNRAS 512, 490\u2013504 (2022)\no the opposite polarization state due to electronic or mechanical mperfections in the feed. Hence, the feed matrix is given by\nD \u2032 pR d \u2032 pR \u2212d \u2032 pL D \u2032 pL\n) , (18)\nhere R and L denote the two feed receptors (here, in the circular rame). This feed matrix may be decomposed as\nD \u2032 pR 0 0 D \u2032 pL\n)( 1 d pR \u2212d pL 1 ) = G \u2032 p D p ,\nwhere d pR = d \u2032 pR /D \u2032 pR . (19) he matrix G \u2032 p may be absorbed in the G-Jones terms that represent\nhe receiver gains (see Section 3.5 ). The matrix D p is the feed error r the leakage D-Jones term, with the complex numbers d pR and d pL epresenting the fractional leakage from either feed.\n.4.3 Implementation\nEQSV2 can introduce station-based, frequency-dependent, omplex-valued instrumental polarization. The per station complex -term values for the two polarization feeds are sampled indeendently for each frequency channel from the normal distribution ( d p\u03bc, d p\u03c3 ); d p \u03bc denotes the characteristic empirical leakage value nd d p \u03c3 denotes the scatter for station p . The visibilities may be ritten to the MS in either the sky or the antenna coordinate ystem (i.e. without or with parallactic angle rotation correction espectively). The visibilities in the two coordinate systems are elated by\nant = P p V sky P H q , (20) here P p are given by equation ( 17 ). This rotation also includes a\nonstant offset in the feed angle per station. Once this rotation has een applied, the D-terms can be applied to the visibilities in the ntenna frame,\n= D p ( P p ) V sky ( P H q ) D H q . (21) If the visibilities are required to be written in the sky frame, then sky is converted to V ant so that the D-terms may be applied, before eing converted back to the sky frame,\n= ( P H p ) D p ( P p ) V sky ( P H q ) D H q ( P q ) .

(23)\nhe visibilities are usually generated in this frame to correspond to he EHT data.\n.5 Temporal and spectral variability in receiver gains\nhe antenna-based gain terms are represented by the complex-valued -Jones matrices which are a generalization of simple antenna gains\no polarimetry (e.g. Smirnov 2011a ). The electronic gains of a pair f circular receptors are given by a diagonal G-Jones matrix in the ircular coordinate frame\np ( t) = (\ng pR ( t) 0 0 g pL ( t)\n) . (24)\nifferent antenna-based factors such as the G \u2032 term in equation ( 19 )\nay be subsumed into the G-Jones terms. The time-variable complex ains are generated by sampling from the normal distribution ( g p\u03bc, g p\u03c3 ) per timestamp, for both the polarization feeds for each tation p , where g p \u03bc denotes the characteristic station-dependent gain nd g p \u03c3 denotes the scatter.\nVarious components along the signal path and the bandpass filters sed at each station determine the frequency response of the receiving hannels o v er the observing bandwidth (Taylor, Carilli & Perley 999 ). This response is not constant o v er the entire bandwidth and sually falls to about half of the maximum towards both edges f the passband. This results in a frequency-dependent component n the antenna gains which is captured using complex-valued Bones matrices that vary as a function of frequency. This effect s usually corrected for by observing a bandpass calibrator source hose behaviour across the observing bandwidth is well-known. As with the G-Jones terms, the B-Jones matrices for circular eceptors are diagonal in a circular coordinate frame,\np ( \u03bd) = (\nb pR ( \u03bd) 0 0 b pL ( \u03bd)\n) . (25)\nor each station, MEQSV2 accepts nominal gain values at a few epresentative frequencies within the bandwidth of the observation, nd performs spline interpolation of the bandpass amplitudes for ach frequency channel. To these amplitudes, random phases are enerated and added to produce the complex quantities. The G-Jones nd B-Jones terms are simulated separately to provide independent, ne-grained variability of gains along the time and frequency xes.\n.6 Noise considerations\n.6.1 Thermal noise\noise due to various factors such as receiver electronics, atmospheric mission, background radiation and ground (i.e. spillo v er) radiation ffect the system sensitivity adversely. The system temperature, T s ys , qui v alent to the power per unit frequency due to the noise, P N , ccounts for this noise and is given by\ns ys = P N k , (26)\nB\nhere k B is the Boltzmann constant. 8 The system temperature is often xpressed in terms of the system equi v alent flux density (SEFD), hich is defined as the flux density of a source that would deliver he same amount of power as the system\nEFD = 2 k B T sys \u03b7A e , (27)\nhere \u03b7 is the antenna efficiency and A e is the effective area of he antenna. MEQSV2 accepts the station-dependent SEFD values s inputs from which the per-baseline rms uncertainty, \u03c3 pq , on a isibility in units of Jy is computed (Thompson et al. 2017 ):\npq = 1 \u03b7\n\u221a SEFD p SEFD q\n2 \u03bd\u03c4 , (28)\nhere A e denotes the ef fecti ve area of the telescope and \u03b7 comprises ny rele v ant ef ficiency terms, such as the antenna aperture efficiency, ap , the correlator efficiency, \u03b7corr , \u03bd is the bandwidth and \u03c4 the nte gration time. F or standard 2-bit quantization, \u03b7 is set to 0.88. ince the system noise is broadband and mostly stationary, it can e described using a Gaussian distribution and the uncertainty in heir measurements can be reduced by increasing the number of ndependent measurements N = 2 \u03bd\u03c4 .\nIn the RIME implementation, this thermal noise becomes an dditive term per polarization, distributed normally with zero mean nd a variance of \u03c3 2 pq per visibility:\npq = V \u2032 pq + N (0 , \u03c3 2 pq ) . (29) his additive thermal noise matrix has the same dimensionality as\nhe data, varying with time, baseline, frequency and polarization.\n.6.2 Visibility weighting\nhe MS format allows for the estimated rms noise values and isibility weights to be recorded alongside the data. The \u03c3 pq alues computed abo v e are used to generate per-visibility baselineependent thermal noise. These terms are added with the increase in he sky brightness temperature due to the troposphere (Section 3.3.1 ) nd are used to fill the SIGMA and SIGMA SPECTRUM columns n the MS. Inverse-variance weighting is used to fill in the visibility eights columns WEIGHT and WEIGHT SPECTRUM.\nP O L S O LV E : P O L A R I Z AT I O N L E A K AG E STIMATION\ne use POLSOL VE to validate the instrumental polarization capailities of MEQSV2 .

It uses two different approaches to account for the olarization structure of a source, both of which assume that the ource brightness distribution can be described as a linear combinaion of source components (e.g. point sources, for the case of CLEAN econvolution, H \u0308ogbom 1974 ). The first approach divides the set of CLEAN components { I i } into s subsets, also called source \u2018subregions\u2019, for which a constant fracional polarization is assumed. The corresponding model visibility unctions for Stokes Q and U are given by\nQ = N s \u2211 s\n( q s\nn s \u2211 k\nF ( I s k ) )\nand V U = N s \u2211 s\n( u s\nn s \u2211 k\nF ( I s k ) ) ,\n(30)\nhere N s is the number of subregions with constant fractional olarization, n s is the number of CLEAN components inside the -th subregion, and I s k is k -th CLEAN component of Stokes I in the -th subre gion. The v ectors q = { q s } and u = { u s } are the parameters hat POLSOLVE fits for.\nThe second approach uses independent, and fixed ( N s = 0), source odels for the brightness distributions of Q and U . The model\nisibilities for Q and U then take the simple form\nQ = N q \u2211 i F ( Q i ) and V U = N u \u2211 i F ( U i ) , (31)\nhere { Q i } and { U i } are the (e.g. CLEAN ) components used to model he polarization source structure. In this case, POLSOLVE performs a ross-polarization self-calibration estimate of the D-terms.\nInstrumental polarization is represented by two complex quantities er antenna, corresponding to each polarization.

We construct the functions for the omplex polarization vector, P , in the form\nP = V Q + jV U and V P \u2217 = V Q \u2212 jV U .

MEQSV2 has also een used to generate 5 GHz synthetic EVN observations for imulating phase corruptions affecting astrometric uncertainties (van angevelde et al. 2019 ). Roelofs et al. ( 2020 ) use MEQSV2 for enerating uncalibrated synthetic data observed using an extended HT array with additional stations located at potential future sites. We generate synthetic data with MEQSV2 for three mm-wavelength rrays: EHT2017 array, ngVLA in its long baseline array configuraion, and ALMA array in its extended configuration. The EHT2017 rray consists of the stations shown in Table 1 observing at a requency of 230 GHz. The ngVLA array consists of all 18 stations n the Long Baseline Array (LBA) and the central core reduced to a ingle high-sensitivity site, observing at 86 GHz. ALMA consists of 3 12-metre diameter antennas in its most extended configuration, bserving at 230 GHz. An asymmetric crescent (Kamruddin & exter 2013 ) created with EHT-IMAGING , with the inner radius offset y 3 \u03bcas in the horizontal direction was used as the source model Fig. 7 , right ).\nVarious propagation path effects described in the previous secion such as pointing of fsets, tropospheric ef fects, recei ver gains, olarization leakage, and thermal noise are introduced. Nominal ointing offsets based on a priori station information are used (e.g. oelofs et al. 2020 ). The aperture efficiencies were determined using argeted observations of planets of known brightness temperatures s calibrators (Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration 2019c ). The ndividual station SEFDs are determined by extrapolating measured ystem temperatures to zero airmass (Janssen et al. 2019 ; Roelofs t al. 2020 ).\nWe adopt the median values measured by VLBIMONITOR 12 at the ndividual sites during the 2017 EHT observing campaign (Event\n2 https:// bitbucket.org/ vlbi .\nH F t E 2 I t c i\ni s r v T 8 h o m t\n6 Q\nI e a p n t d u\nFigure 9.

The atmospheric onditions o v er all the ALMA antennas are the same, though ndependently simulated for each antenna. The top row of Fig. 8 shows the uv -co v erages for the three arrays n the direction of M87 at their respective observing frequencies, ho wing ho w the dif ferent arrays complement each other. The bottom ow of Fig. 8 shows both the corrupted and uncorrupted Stokes I isibility amplitudes for each array as a function of uv -distance. he 60 \u03bcas crescent is fully resolved by EHT2017 as expected. At 6 GHz, ngVLA resolves it partially, clearly seeing the source as aving some extended structure. ALMA, with its longest baselines f only 12 km, sees the crescent as a point source at 230 GHz and the odel visibilities show up as a straight line at 5 Jy in the figure. In he following sections, we concentrate only on the EHT2017 array. EFFECT O F BA N D PA S S O N C L O S U R E UANTITIES\nn this section, we estimate the magnitude of systematic non-closing rrors introduced by complex bandpass gains in EHT observations t 230 GHz using synthetic data. We introduce station-based bandasses of varying shapes, spline-interpolated to all frequency chanels as shown in Fig. 9 . The phases are sampled conserv ati vely within he uniform range of \u00b130 \u25e6 (Michael Janssen, pri v ate comm). Two ifferent sky models from (Kamruddin & Dexter 2013 ), generated sing EHT-IMAGING were used: a symmetric ring with outer radius\n0 \u03bcas and width 3 \u03bcas, and an asymmetric crescent with the inner adius offset by 3 \u03bcas in the horizontal direction (Fig. 7 ). The total ux of the ring was set to 5 Jy to ensure that the S/N of the data was igh so that systematic non-closing errors could be unambiguously etected. Thermal noise generated using equation ( 28 ) was applied o all datasets. All synthetic data sets used in this subsection are enerated with a time resolution of 1 s and a frequency resolution f 31.25 MHz per frequency channel, with 64 channels, spanning a andwidth of 2 GHz. These data are then band-averaged to a single hannel of width 2 GHz. We generated four categories of synthetic\nMNRAS 512, 490\u2013504 (2022)\nM\nd o\nt\nt e\n\u03c8\na p\nl\nw t c S c f w a c\nt d i d v\nM\nw T e t d\n\u03c3\nw s c e\nM\ni f e t\ne v c 0 l n s\nt b c f s 5\nc E a E f t s M c\n7 P\n7\nT M r a d s i n 1 w f d s w f E\ni a m o p s a C\ns d g I t a c f p l t ( a a\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/512/1/490/6537429 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nata, with 10 data sets to each category, differing in the realization f thermal noise:\n(i) symmetric ring with only thermal noise corruption, (ii) symmetric ring with thermal noise and bandpass corruption, (iii) asymmetric crescent with only thermal noise corruption, and (iv) asymmetric crescent with thermal noise and bandpass corrup-\nion.\nClosure quantities are formed around a closed loop of stations o eliminate the effects of station-based gain errors (e.g. Blackburn t al. 2020 ). Closure phases are formed o v er a closed triangle pqr as\nC,pqr = arg (V pq V qr V rp ) , (34) nd closure amplitudes are formed o v er a quadrangle of stations qrs :\nn A C,pqrs = ln V pq V rs V pr V qs , (35)\nhere \u2018ln\u2019 is the natural logarithm. The closure phases (CP) and he log closure amplitudes (LCA) are susceptible to systematic nonlosing errors. The intra-site baselines ALMA-APEX and JCMTMA enable one to form \u2018trivial\u2019 closure quantities, between different ombinations of these four stations. The trivial CP and LCA so ormed should ideally be zero, but factors such as band-averaging ithout correcting for bandpass errors and intrinsic large-scale symmetry in source structure can break the assumptions of trivial losure.\nWe e v aluate the magnitude of systematic non-closing errors in rivial closure quantities following the EHT data validation proceures outlined in Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration ( 2019c ) and n Wielgus et al. ( 2019 ). We employ the MAD 0 (median absolute eviation from zero) statistic, which, for a normally distributed ariable Y with zero mean takes the form\nAD 0 ( Y ) = 1 . 4826 median ( | Y | ) , (36) here the subscript 0 denotes that the raw moment is estimated. he scaling factor 1.4826 ensures that MAD 0 acts as an unbiased stimator of standard deviation for normally distributed data. The otal uncertainty, \u03c3 , associated with the trivial closure quantities efined abo v e is giv en by\n2 = \u03c3 2 th + s 2 , (37) here \u03c3 th is the known thermal component and s denotes the\nystematic non-closing error, modeled as a constant. For a trivial losure quantity X , we solve for the characteristic value of s by nforcing a following condition:\nAD 0\n( X\n\u03c3\n) = MAD 0 ( X \u221a \u03c3 2 th + s 2 ) = 1 . (38)\nThe MAD 0 values estimated using equation ( 36 ) and the characterstic magnitude of systematic errors s calculated with equation ( 38 ) or the four data sets are given in Table 2 . The uncertainties are stimated by obtaining these values for 10 data sets with different hermal noise realizations.\nIf the error budget is exactly accounted for, then the MAD 0 stimator is equal to 1. This is evident from the estimated MAD 0 alues being very close to unity when thermal noise is the only orruption introduced. The corresponding systematic errors are about .08 \u25e6 for trivial closure phases and less than 0.4 per cent for trivial og closure amplitudes. In the presence of bandpass gains that are ot accounted for in the error budget, the MAD 0 values and the ystematic errors increase noticeably. For the trivial closure phases,\nNRAS 512, 490\u2013504 (2022)\nhe MAD 0 values indicate that the reported errors are too small y factors of 2.76 and 3.86, for the symmetric ring and asymmetric rescent models respectively; for trivial log closure amplitudes, these actors increase to about 4 and 7.5 respectively. The estimated ystematics are about 0.7 \u25e6 for trivial closure phases and up to per cent for trivial log closure amplitudes. For the scale of bandpass gains assumed here, these errors are omparable to the magnitude of the systematic non-closing errors for HT 2017 observations of 3C 279 and M87 (2 \u25e6 for closure phases nd less than 4 per cent for log closure amplitudes) quantified by vent Horizon Telescope Collaboration ( 2019c ). Alongside the many actors such as intrinsic source structure or polarisation leakage, his indicates how unaccounted-for bandpass errors can have a imilar effect on the closure quantities. The spectral capabilities of EQSV2 will enable us to perform a thorough study of EHT bandpass haracteristics and their effect on the observed data.\nSIMULATING I NSTRU MENTAL OLARI ZATI ON\n.1 Simulating polarized sources with leakage\no validate the implementation of instrumental polarization in EQSV2 using POLSOLVE , we generate six synthetic data sets, cor-\nupted with instrumental polarization, time-varying complex gains, nd thermal noise. The accuracy to which D-terms can be estimated epends on various factors such as station parameters and intrinsic ource polarization structure. The source models we use are shown n the first column of Fig. 10 . The truth images convolved with the ominal EHT beam are shown in the second column. Source model is a highly polarized ring while model 2 is an offset crescent ith low polarization. In both models, the polarized structure closely ollows the Stokes I distribution. Models 3-5 are ring sources with iffering EVPA structures. Model 6 represents the characteristic ource structure of any VLBI calibrator source at cm and mmavelengths. We choose models differing in EVPA structures and ractional polarization. All source model images are generated using HT-IMAGING .\nThe polarization calibration is performed by running POLSOLVE n iterative self-calibration mode. The D-terms for ALMA-APEX nd, optionally, JCMT-SMA, are solved for using a point source odel and are fixed for the rest of the calibration process. A model f the source is generated using CLEAN and multiple iterations of hase and amplitude self-calibration are performed with decreasing olution interv als. Finally, se veral iterations of POLSOLVE and CLEAN re performed, by fixing the full polarization model to the output of LEAN at each iteration. The reconstructed images convolved with the CLEAN beam are hown in the third column of Fig. 10 . The polarization peaks isplayed in each panel are found to correlate well between the round-truth images and the reconstructed images, as are the Stokes distribution and the polarization structure. Fig. 11 shows the Derms reco v ered by POLSOLVE for each data set for all stations, long with the ground-truth D-term values. The reco v ered D-terms orrelate highly with the ground-truth values. The reco v ered D-terms or model 1 are the least accurate owing to its high intrinsic fractional olarization. D-terms of similar magnitude applied to models with ow fractional polarization are estimated more accurately. The Derm estimates for the stations participating in intra-baseline fitting ALMA-APEX and JCMT-SMA) are the most tightly constrained nd those corresponding to the station with the longest baselines on short ( u , v) track, PV, have the largest dispersion.\nTable 2.

The D-terms were generated independently for ach channel by sampling them from a normal distribution. We use OLSOLVE in iterative self-calibration mode to solve for these Derms, treating them as independent complex numbers per frequency hannel (see Section 4 ). We use Model 3 from Fig. 10 to generate synthetic data with 2 GHz andwidth divided into 32 spectral windows, with frequency-varying -terms introduced alongside complex gains and thermal noise. ig. 12 shows the simulated D-terms and the D-terms reco v ered y POLSOLVE with error bars. The estimated D-terms correlate emarkably well with the simulated values. The magnitude of the rrors are similar to that corresponding to model 3 in Fig. 11 . DISCUSSION ynthetic observations provide uniform data sets with known source nd instrumental properties for performing various kinds of feasiility studies. Since MEQSV2 aims to compute data corruptions from rst principles, it can be used to perform a systematic exploration of ealistic site and antenna parameters, which helps in commissioning ew sites and optimizing observing schedules (e.g. Blackburn et al. 020 ). Conversely, with known site and antenna characteristics, he synthetic data can be used to quantitatively compare different strophysical source models that characterize the observed emission. The realistic synthetic data provided by MEQSV2 can be used o v alidate ne w imaging, calibration, and parameter estimation echniques. Synthetic data generated with MEQSV2 have been used to est ZA GR OS , a fully-Bayesian fringe-fitting framework for analyzing LBI observations (Natarajan et al. 2020 ). These data can potentially e used to compare different parameter estimation frameworks curently being used for analyzing EHT data, such as THEMIS (Broderick t al. 2020 ), MARCH (Psaltis et al. 2020 ), and DMC 13 (Pesce 2021 ). ully end-to-end pipelines starting from synthetic data generation ith MEQSV2 , followed by a priori calibration and posterior estiation using statistical visibility analysis packages are under active\nevelopment to enable large-scale feasibility studies. The modular ature of the software lends itself easily to constructing such end-tond pipelines that allow calibration to start further up the signal chain e.g. Natarajan et al. 2020 ). The computational requirements for such arge-scale studies necessitate adapting these software packages to a igh Performance Computing (HPC) environment. The experiments performed in this paper are intended to illusrate the capabilities of MEQSV2 . More elaborate studies of the arious propagation path effects on calibration and imaging must e performed for future site selection and testing the capabilities nd limitations of ne w algorithms. More exhausti ve exploration of\n3 https:// github.com/dpesce/ eht-dmc .\ns d a\nrequency-dependent gain variations and their effects on closure uantities (see Section 6 ) need to be performed to fully understand he bandpass characteristics of the EHT array and solve for them.\nSection 7 illustrates how fractional polarization intrinsic to the ource and the lack of short baselines to a station can affect the eco v ery of station-based instrumental polarization. The accuracy f the measured D-terms can be impro v ed by performing a selfonsistent multi-source fit to the D-terms, if observations of multiple ources are available for the same epoch (e.g. Mart \u0301\u0131-Vidal et al. 021 ). More complex experiments devised to study this effect will elp to fully exploit the full-polarization data products generated by HT observations.\nSUMMARY A N D O U T L O O K\ne present MEQSV2 , a synthetic data generation software package apable of performing synthetic VLBI observations with full poarimetric, time and frequenc y-resolv ed astrophysical models and ealistic propagation path effects. It can also be seamlessly integrated ith calibration tools such as the EHT CASA pipeline to perform dditional calibration steps to mimic VLBI data at different stages long the propagation path.\nWe conduct preliminary investigations of how source model asymetry affects closure quantities in the presence of complex bandpass\nf fects. We also v alidate the polarimetric capabilities of MEQSV2 by enerating synthetic EHT observations of polarized geometric source odels with instrumental polarization and estimating the D-terms sing POLSOLVE , showing that the reconstructed images correlate ery well with input source models.\nFuture versions will be able to simulate more polarimetric effects uch as Faraday rotation in the ISM and ionospheric phase corruption ffects for simulating cm-VLBI radio observations. The ability to nput more time and frequency-variable weather parameters will lso be introduced. We also plan to take full advantage of new istributed and parallel computing algorithms and software packages or generating synthetic data sets on a large scale much faster.\nMEQSV2 currently optionally splits large data sets into subsets or processing, to accommodate systems with low memory specications. Such features can easily be ported to forward-modelling oftware packages such as CODEX-AFRICANUS (Perkins et al. in prep) hich provide distributed CPU and GPU computing functionality. or handling large data sets, we plan to use DASK-MS (Perkins et al. n prep), which uses DASK , an open source library for parallel rogramming in Python (Rocklin 2015 ), to scale computations. ASK-MS can convert MS v2.0 data between the CASA table format, nd other high performance, cloud-native formats such as PARQUET Vohra 2016 ) and ZARR (Miles et al. 2021 ). These new formats re explicitly designed for parallel, distributed processing and offer uperior disc I/O performance, which will accelerate the synthetic ata generation process. Finally, we also plan to set up a publicly vailable online interface to MEQSV2 , which can be of use to students\nMNRAS 512, 490\u2013504 (2022)\nM\nNRAS 512, 490\u2013504 (2022)\na c\nA\nW W R P A o D a o P ( a s t a a U F U 2 E l Z ( R\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/512/1/490/6537429 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nnd teachers alike without them having to invest in the requisite omputing power.
