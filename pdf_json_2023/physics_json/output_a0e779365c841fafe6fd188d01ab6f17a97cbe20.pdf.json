    "abstractText": "Converting seed coat peas (hulls) (SCP) into beneficial products provides a solution for waste treatment. This study aimed to investigate the phytoconstituents and biological activities of SCP extract. Phytochemical screening, total bioactive compounds, and GC\u2013MS analysis were evaluated. Then, the antioxidant, antibacterial, anticancer, and antiviral activities of SCP extract were determined. The results demonstrate that SCP extract has bioactive compounds such as carbohydrates (29.53 \u00b1 4.23 mg/mL), protein (0.24 \u00b1 0.02 mg/mL), phenolics (27.04 \u00b1 0.94 mg GAE/g extract), and flavonoids (17.19 \u00b1 0.48 mg QE/g extract). The existence of more than 16 substances was determined using GC\u2013MS analysis. The extract showed potential antioxidant activities, with the maximum activity seen for extract (IC50 \u03bcg/ mL) = 79.16 \u00b1 1.77 for DPPH, 67.40 \u00b1 5.20 for ORAC, and 61.22 \u00b1 4.81 for ABTS assays. The SCP extract showed potent antimicrobial activity against four gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Streptomyces sp., Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella sp.) and two gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas sp.). SCP extract exhibited potential anticancer activity against lymphoma U937 and leukemic cells (THP1). The extract exhibited potential antiviral activity, with a selectivity index (SI) equal to 11.30 and 18.40 against herpes simplex-II (HSV-2) and adenovirus (Ad7), respectively. The results demonstrate more accurate information about peas by-products\u2019 chemical and antioxidant activities in various applications. The chemical components of peas by-products were found to have an in vitro antioxidant, antibacterial, and antiviral activity against leukemia and lymphoma.",

            "text": "The widespread use of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a major public health concern [1]; this is mostly the consequence of deliberate efforts to genetically modify germs to be resistant to a certain medicine. Meanwhile, studies have shown that viruses are among earth\u2019s most common forms of life [2, 3]. Millions of individuals are sick with viruses, and many do not get treatments or vaccinations, particularly for retrovirus infections [4]. Infections with the hepatitis C virus (HCV), adenovirus type 7 (ADV7), or herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) are universally devastating illnesses that may cause a variety of liver complications, as well as mortality and genital herpes [5]. Constant effort is put towards discovering a more effective material derived from nature that may mitigate this threat to public health. The potential of several plants as antibacterial and antiviral agents has been studied [6].\nOne study found that lymphoma accounts for 3% of all cancers globally [7]. Since lymphoma is linked to immune system damage, some hereditary illnesses, *Correspondence: Hanaa S. S. Gazwi hanaa.saleh@mu.edu.eg 1 Department of Agricultural Chemistry, Faculty of Agriculture, Minia University, El-Minya, Egypt 2 Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Agriculture, Minia University, El-Minya, Egypt\nimmunosuppressive medication regimens, and specific viruses are recognized as risk factors [7]. Myeloid blood cells proliferate too quickly and unisexually, giving rise to the hematological malignancy known as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) [8]. About 351,000 new instances of leukemia are diagnosed annually across the globe, accounting for 2.8% of all cancers and 3.4% of all cancer deaths [9]. Clinical therapies such as bone marrow transplant, radiation, and chemotherapy are used to treat leukemia patients; however, most treatments are not yet suitable due to the significant side effects that are still encountered. Because of their ability to prevent tumor development at several stages, phytochemicals are gaining significance as a source [10].\nThe pea (Pisum sativum L.) is a nutritious leguminous crop that is extensively farmed [11]. Pea has a good balance of macronutrients, like dietary fibers, carbohydrates, high-quality proteins, minerals, and vitamins, and is good for health [12]. Peas also have a lot of antioxidants, which mostly come in the form of phenols, carotenoids, and tocopherols [12]. Legume seed coats are natural antioxidants with anti-inflammatory, heart-protective, anticancer, and other beneficial properties that work with protein-rich seeds to improve health [13]. Pea seed coats have a lot of bioactive phenolic compounds. Moreover, it has a lot of flavonoid compounds, which are becoming known for their ability to fight free radicals and act as antioxidants [14].\nOn the other hand, the waste products of the peas industry processing must be considered to avoid pollution. As a result, it is vital to examine their chemical composition and biological activities to maintain appropriate usage of these wastes in various applications [15]. Therefore, this study is the first to validate the phytochemical analysis, antioxidant capacities, and in\u00a0 vitro biological activities of the extract of SCP."

The crystal violet method evaluated the antiviral activity and cytotoxicity assays using the recently reported cytopathic (CPE) inhibition effect [26]. In brief, Vero cells were seeded at a density of 2 \u00d7 105 cells/well into a 96-well plate one day before infection. The following day, the growth media were withdrawn, and the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline.\nThe virus\u2019s infectivity was measured by the crystal violet technique, which monitored CPE and allowed\nfor calculating the proportion of viable cells. A 0.1\u00a0 mL diluted virus suspension containing 50% of the virus stock\u2019s CCID50 (cell culture infective dose) was introduced to mammalian cells. Three days after infection, this dose was chosen to produce the necessary CPEs. The 0.01\u00a0 mL of media containing the required compound concentration was used to treat the cells.

Also, the obtained data revealed that the most affected bacterial strains\nbelonged to gram-negative bacteria (E. coli,\u00a0 Salmonella sp., and Pseudomonas sp.).

As a result, these chemical groups may include the most active compounds for leukemia [62]. Cell-to-cell communication is widely recognized as the most effective cell-type distinction in development and established tissue organization patterns [63]. At virtually every stage of development, cells send and receive signals from neighboring cells, which are essential for proper differentiation and function [64].

Flavonoids and other phenolics are particularly intriguing candidates for preventing cancer [61]. There is significant evidence of the potential inhibitory effects of certain plant phenolic extracts on carcinogenesis and mutagenesis [63]. Due to the apparent\ndiversity of dietary phenolics, including flavonoids, and the numerous possible pathways reported, scientists assumed that a single substance was not responsible for all the associations between cancer prevention and plant food intake [62].
