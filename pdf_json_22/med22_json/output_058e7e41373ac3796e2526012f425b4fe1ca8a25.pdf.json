    "abstractText": "Mathematical models that incorporate the temperature dependence of lab-measured life history traits are increasingly being used to predict how climatic warming will affect ectotherms, including disease vectors and other arthropods. These temperature-trait relationships are typically measured under laboratory conditions that ignore how conspecific competition in depleting resource environments\u2014a commonly occurring scenario in nature\u2014regulates natural populations. Here, we used laboratory experiments on the mosquito Aedes aegypti, combined with a stage-structured population model, to investigate this issue. We find that intensified larval competition in ecologically-realistic depleting resource environments can significantly diminish the vector\u2019s maximal population-level fitness across the entire temperature range, cause a ~6 \u00b0C decrease in the optimal temperature for fitness, and contract its thermal niche width by ~10 \u00b0C. Our results provide evidence for the importance of considering intra-specific competition under depleting resources when predicting how arthropod populations will respond to climatic warming. https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-022-03030-7 OPEN",

Cator 3\nMathematical models that incorporate the temperature dependence of lab-measured life\nhistory traits are increasingly being used to predict how climatic warming will affect ecto-\ntherms, including disease vectors and other arthropods. These temperature-trait relationships\nare typically measured under laboratory conditions that ignore how conspecific competition\nin depleting resource environments\u2014a commonly occurring scenario in nature\u2014regulates\nnatural populations. Here, we used laboratory experiments on the mosquito Aedes aegypti,\ncombined with a stage-structured population model, to investigate this issue. We find that\nintensified larval competition in ecologically-realistic depleting resource environments can\nsignificantly diminish the vector\u2019s maximal population-level fitness across the entire tem-\nperature range, cause a ~6 \u00b0C decrease in the optimal temperature for fitness, and contract its\nthermal niche width by ~10 \u00b0C. Our results provide evidence for the importance of considering\nintra-specific competition under depleting resources when predicting how arthropod popu-\nlations will respond to climatic warming.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-022-03030-7 OPEN\n1MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, School of Public Health, Imperial College London, London, UK. 2MRC Unit The Gambia at London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, Banjul, The Gambia. 3 Department of Life Sciences, Imperial College London, Ascot, UK. \u2709email: p.huxley@imperial.ac.uk\nCOMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | (2022) 5:66 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-022-03030-7 | www.nature.com/commsbio 1\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\nG lobal environmental change is predicted to affect thespatiotemporal distributions of arthropods, includingdisease vectors and the diseases they transmit1,2. For example, a recent study suggests that climatic warming may increase the thermal suitability for Zika virus transmission, leading to 1.3 billion more people being at risk of exposure by 20503. Other studies have predicted that warming will increase the global invasion potential of Aedes aegypti, a principal vector of dengue, yellow fever and chikungunya4. Such predictions typically arise from mathematical models that incorporate thermal performance curves (TPCs) for vector life history traits, such as juvenile development and mortality, which together define the TPC of maximal population growth rate (rm, a measure of population fitness)5.\nTypically, such trait-level TPC data come from larval populations reared under optimal food conditions in the laboratory (e.g.,6). However, recent studies suggest that many predictions of how vector populations will respond to climatic warming are likely to be biased. For example, when food is supplied at a constant rate, low resource availability in the larval stage can have a significant negative effect on temperature-trait relationships7\u20139. In particular, our recent work9 has shown that low-resource supply, through its adverse impact on juvenile traits, can significantly depress population fitness and decrease its predicted peak temperature. Despite such advances, resources in natural habitats are not constant and, in many, or arguably even most cases, deplete over time10\u201312. For example, Ae. aegypti is expected to be strongly regulated by conspecific competition between larvae13,14, because this stage of the species\u2019 lifecycle is confined to small isolated water bodies that are susceptible to infrequent resource inputs and, therefore, resource depletion15\u201318.\nIn such small, isolated aquatic habitats, resource levels will deplete if consumption rates exceed replacement rates. Abiotic factors such as rainfall may also abruptly dilute resources in the habitat, exacerbating the biotic resource depletion rate. The extent of resource depletion ultimately influences the strength of larval competition in mosquitoes, acting as a regulatory mechanism on the population. In particular, as per-capita energy requirements increase with warming, resource depletion from direct consumption, and therefore the strength of competition should also increase. These combined effects are bound to compromise the development and survival of individuals as the deficit between resource uptake and energy use increases. These trait-level effects are then expected to propagate through the stage-structured population dynamics to affect the shape of the rm TPC19,20. This is because rm is essentially proportional to the difference between biomass gained through consumption and that lost to respiration and mortality5. Moreover, intensified competition should decrease rm across temperatures, albeit to different degrees.\nFurthermore, if the rate of biomass loss increases faster than any increase in biomass gain with temperature, the thermal optimum of (rm Topt) may also shift downwards21,22. For the same reason, the range of temperatures over which rm is positive (the thermal niche width) may become narrower. As a result, the combined effects of climatic warming and decreased resource availability could contribute to the contraction of species range boundaries. This effect could simultaneously decrease the burden of vector-borne diseases and agricultural pests but increase the extinction risk of vulnerable species23,24. Conversely, concurrent increases in temperature and resource availability with climatic warming could have the opposite effect by optimising rm, and thus, promoting the invasion and establishment of tropical taxa into temperate habitats25. This effect could further increase the huge socioeconomic cost of invasions by disease vectors, such as Aedes mosquitoes26.\nStudies across a broad range of taxa are needed to make generalisable predictions on the ecological impacts of environmental\nchange on ectotherm populations, including disease vectors27,28. So far, however, the effects of competition in depleting resource environments on the temperature dependence of ectotherm fitness have mainly focused on single-celled prokaryotes29\u201331. To address this important deficit, we investigated the effects of competition on the rm TPC by exposing Ae. aegypti larvae to an ecologically realistic range of temperatures and depleting resource levels. We show that competition in resource depletion scenarios will significantly change the shape of the thermal response of mosquito population fitness\u2014key for predicting how disease vectors and other arthropods will respond to environmental change. Our findings allow us to infer that there are thresholds of resource availability, below which intensifying competition causes a dramatic change in this temperature dependence of fitness."

            "text": "We investigated how Ae. aegypti population fitness traits respond to temperature and resource depletion using a factorial experimental design comprised of five temperatures and four resource levels. We used standard linear model (LM) fitting to analyse normally distributed trait responses (adult lifespan and body size). For trait data that were not normally distributed (juvenile development time), we used generalised linear model (GLM) fitting to analyse these responses. For juvenile mortality, we fitted an exponential function to survival data using the \u2018flexsurv\u2019 R package32.\nAll trait responses varied significantly with temperature and resource level, with a significant interaction between the two environmental variables (Fig. 1, Tables 1, 2).\nLarval competition at our lowest resource level (0.183mgml\u22121) increased the negative effect of increased temperature on juvenile mortality rate (Fig. 1a, Table 2). As temperatures increased from 22 to 34 \u00b0C, non-overlapping 95% credible intervals indicate that juvenile mortality rate was significantly higher at low-resource levels than at intermediate-resource levels (0.367 mgml\u22121). At 0.183 mgml\u22121, it increased by ~200% from 0.05 at 22 \u00b0C to 0.14 individual\u22121 day\u22121 at 34 \u00b0C. In contrast, at 0.367mgml\u22121, the juvenile mortality rate increased by 25% (from 0.04 to 0.05 individual\u22121 day\u22121) across this temperature range.\nThe interaction between temperature and resource level caused significant variation in development time across treatments (ANOVA; F9, 2.24= 13.44, P < 0.001, Table 1). Development time decreased with temperature at all resource levels, but the decrease with temperature was greater at the low resource level than at higher resource levels due to resource depletion (Fig. 1b). At 0.183 mgml\u22121, development time decreased from 18.30 days at 22 \u00b0C to 8.26 days at 34 \u00b0C. Development time at the higher resource levels decreased from ~13.50 days at 22 \u00b0C to ~7.50 days at 34 \u00b0C (Table 2).\nCompetition at low resource levels (0.183 mgml\u22121) resulted in significant variation in size at maturity (mass, mg) between resource levels (ANOVA; F9,0.92= 24.26, P < 0.001, Table 1). Adult size decreased both at warmer temperatures and at lowresource levels, though the decrease with temperature was greater at higher resource levels than at the low resource level. At lowresource levels, size decreased by 0.13 mg as temperatures increased from 22 to 34 \u00b0C, while at the highest resource level (0.733 mgml\u22121), size decreased by 0.26 mg (Fig. 1c, Table 2).\nThe interaction between temperature and resource level caused significant variation in adult lifespan across treatments (ANOVA; F9, 699.60= 7.96, P < 0.001, Table 1). The adult size was largest at the highest larval resource level (0.733 mgml\u22121) at 22 \u00b0C and 26 \u00b0C, which caused lifespan to be greatest at these temperatures (11.24 and 11.65 days, respectively). Lifespan at 0.733 mgml\u22121\nthen decreased to 4.68 days at 34 \u00b0C. In contrast, at low resource\n2 COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | (2022) 5:66 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-022-03030-7 | www.nature.com/commsbio\nlevels, decreased size at maturity caused lifespan to decrease from 8.00 days at 22 \u00b0C to 3.76 days at 34 \u00b0C mg (Fig. 1d, Table 2).\nAt all resource levels, predicted daily fecundity rate increased with temperature (Table 2), though the increase was greater at the lowest resource level than at higher resource levels. At the lowest resource level, fecundity increased with temperature from 1.77 eggs individual\u22121 day\u22121 at 22 \u00b0C to 6.87 eggs individual\u22121 day\u22121\nat 34 \u00b0C. At the higher resource levels, fecundity increased from ~2 eggs at 22 \u00b0C to ~5 eggs individual\u22121 day\u22121 at 34 \u00b0C.\nPopulation fitness. At all resource levels, rm responded unimodally to temperature. However, intensified larval competition at low resource levels (0.183 mgml\u22121) significantly depressed rm across the entire temperature range (Fig. 2a) and caused it to peak at a significantly lower temperature than at intermediate resource levels (0.367 mgml\u22121; Fig. 2b, Table 3). Competition at 0.183 mgml\u22121 also significantly narrowed the thermal niche width for rm compared to higher resource levels (Fig. 2a, Table 3).\nAt 0.183 mgml\u22121, rm was negative until temperatures increased to 23.3 \u00b0C (Fig. 2, Table 3). At this resource level, rm\nreached a peak of 0.05 at its Topt (26.6 \u00b0C); it then declined to negative growth at 30.1 \u00b0C. The breadth of rm\u2019s thermal niche width at the lowest resource level was 6.8 \u00b0C. In contrast, at the intermediate food level (0.367 mgml\u22121), rm became positive as temperatures increased to 18.8 \u00b0C; it was maximal at 33.0 \u00b0C (0.24, Fig. 2, Table 3). At 0.367 mgml\u22121, rm declined to negative growth at 35.4 \u00b0C. The thermal niche width for rm at this resource level was 16.6 \u00b0C. Overlapping CIs indicate that the predicted differences between the intermediate resource level and the higher resource levels (0.550 and 0.733 mgml\u22121) in rm at Topt, Topt, and the thermal niche width were non-significant (Fig. 2, Table 3)."

For example, at the lowest resource level (0.183 mgml\u22121) at 26 \u00b0C, a 0.5 proportional increase in juvenile traits would increase the rate of increase from 0.046 to 0.063 (Fig. 3d).

This highlights how the temperature-dependence of rm stems mainly from how competition impacts juvenile survival and development.

So far, studies on the effects of interactions between resource concentration and temperature on fitness in ectotherms have mainly focused on single-celled organisms29\u201331. Studies on eukaryotic ectotherms have shown that their population fitness is inversely related to intensified competition between larvae for depleting resources13,33. However, barring a few notable exceptions34, such studies have not generally included temperature. Here, we have shown that larval competition can significantly change the shape of the rm thermal response in Ae. aegypti. We also show that there are resource availability thresholds, below which competition intensifies, causing a dramatic change in the temperature dependence of fitness. Together, our findings indicate that competition in depleting resource environments is an important regulatory mechanism that needs to be considered when predicting how organisms with complex life cycles will respond to anticipated shifts in environmental temperature with global change.\nAt the lowest resource level (0.183 mgml\u22121), competition had a consistent negative effect on the thermal responses of\nTable 1 Type II Analysis of Variance results from regression models fitted to the responses of life history traits to\ntemperature and resource level (RL).\nTrait Predictor \u03c72 df F value P value\nDevelopment time (GLM) R2= 0.83\nTemperature 50.28 3 903.40 <0.001*** RL 3.97 3 71.28 <0.001*** Temperature \u00d7 RL 2.24 9 13.44 <0.001*** Replicate 0.07 2 1.77 0.17 Residuals 12.63 681\nAdult lifespan (LM) R2= 0.41 Temperature 1594.80 3 54.44 <0.001*** RL 1908.60 3 65.15 <0.001*** Temperature \u00d7 RL 699.60 9 7.96 <0.001***\nReplicate 15.70 2 0.81 0.45 Residuals 6533.10 669\nBody size (LM) R2= 0.73 Temperature 1.32 3 104.92 <0.001*** RL 2.58 3 204.38 <0.001*** Temperature \u00d7 RL 0.92 9 24.26 <0.001***\nReplicate 0.02 2 2.31 0.10 Residuals 1.81 431\nSignificant effects are shown in boldface type. *P value < 0.05; **P value < 0.01; ***P value < 0.001.\n4 COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | (2022) 5:66 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-022-03030-7 | www.nature.com/commsbio\nunderlying fitness traits (Fig. 1), which caused a marked divergence between the rm TPCs (Fig. 2). Competition at the lowest resource level significantly depressed rm across the entire temperature range, caused a significant decrease (~6 \u00b0C) in rm Topt compared to the intermediate resource level (0.367 mgml\u22121), and led to a ~180% contraction of the rm thermal niche width compared to the higher resource levels (Fig. 2, Table 3).\nThe elasticity analysis shows that the key mechanism underlying the divergent temperature dependence of rm across resource levels is increased juvenile development time and mortality at low resource levels (Fig. 3). The negative effect of competition at lowresource levels on these traits delayed the onset of reproduction and population-level reproductive output, respectively. This finding\u2012\u2012that juvenile traits contribute more to rm than adult traits\u2012\u2012is consistent with general studies of fitness in organisms with complex lifecycles35\u201338, including mosquitoes9,39.\nFurthermore, individual fecundity rate and adult lifespan had negligible effects on rm compared to juvenile traits, suggesting that the carry over effect of reduced size at maturity on rm is relatively weak (Fig. 3). For example, at low-resource levels, lifetime fecundity was greater at 22 \u00b0C than at 26 \u00b0C because body size and adult lifespan were greater at 22 \u00b0C. Despite this difference, rm at 26 \u00b0C was predicted to be ~200% greater than at 22 \u00b0C (Figs. 1 and 2, Table 2). This result derives from how juvenile development time almost halved as temperatures increased from\n22 to 26 \u00b0C (Table 2). Although juvenile mortality rates for these treatments were similar (0.05 at 22 \u00b0C versus 0.06 at 26 \u00b0C, Table 2), faster development at 26 \u00b0C meant that greater numbers of individuals could contribute to population growth through reproductive output. This finding is consistent with recent studies that have used constant resource supply rates9 in suggesting that most projections of how warming will affect disease transmission, through its effects on vector abundance, are likely to be biased because they are likely to underestimate the effect of temperature on juvenile traits and overestimate its effect on adult traits.\nWhile rm was most sensitive to the interactive effects of temperature and intensified competition on juvenile traits, the carry over effects of this interaction may influence traits that are more directly involved in disease transmission. For example, increased temperature and intensified competition in the larval stages is likely to cause substantial decreases in vectorial capacity by yielding smaller adults that are less likely than larger individuals to outlive to the pathogen\u2019s extrinsic incubation period (40, but see ref. 41). Future studies could examine how transmission risk changes in response to how temperature interacts with resource depletion to influence other components of vector-borne disease dynamics42.\nStudies on how constant high-resource supply rates affect the temperature dependence of rm in Ae. aegypti similarly report that the optimal temperature for growth in this species is ~32 \u00b0C9,43.\nTable 3 Parameter estimates of the thermal performance curves of population fitness (rm) by resource level.\nResource level (mg ml\u22121)\nrm at Topt (\u00b1 95% CI)\nTopt (\u00b0C) (95% CI)\nTmin (\u00b0C) (95% CI)\nTmax (\u00b0C) (95% CI)\nThermal niche width (\u00b0C) (95% CI)\n0.183 0.05 \u00b1 0.04 26.6 (23.7\u201329.6) 23.3 (22.4\u201324.9) 30.1 (28.6\u201331.2) 6.8 (3.7\u20138.8) 0.367 0.24 \u00b1 0.02 33.0 (31.3\u201334.2) 18.8 (17.1\u201320.2) 35.4 (35.4\u201335.7) 16.6 (15.2\u201318.6) 0.550 0.22 \u00b1 0.02 31.6 (29.2\u201333) 16.2 (12.4\u201318.6) 35.1 (35.0\u201335.3) 18.8 (16.4\u201322.9) 0.733 0.22 \u00b1 0.03 29.6 (27.0\u201331.5) 19.4 (16.6\u201321.0) 34.3 (34.2\u201334.6) 14.9 (13.2\u201318)\nNon-overlapping 95% confidence intervals (CIs) indicate that larval competition at the lowest resource level (0.183 mgml\u22121) significantly depressed maximal growth (rm at Topt) compared to the higher resource levels. Competition at 0.183 mgml\u22121 caused a significant decrease in rm Topt compared to rm Topt at 0.367 mgml\u22121; it also caused a significantly narrower thermal niche width (the thermal maximum for fitness, Tmax, minus the thermal minimum, Tmin) compared to the higher resource levels.\nCOMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | (2022) 5:66 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-022-03030-7 | www.nature.com/commsbio 5\n6 COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | (2022) 5:66 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-022-03030-7 | www.nature.com/commsbio\nHowever, our results here show that depleting resource environments may indeed still result in a negative effect of competition on rm, even when initial resource levels are high, due to a compounding effect. For example, Huxley et al.9 found that rm at high daily per capita resource supply (1 mg larva\u22121 day\u22121) was 0.28 \u00b1 0.05 (95% CI) at 32 \u00b0C, whereas, it was 0.24 \u00b1 0.02 (95% CI) at 32 \u00b0C at the optimal resource level (0.367 mgml\u22121) for rm in this study. Although this difference in rm is statistically insignificant, our elasticity analyses here suggest that it derives from\nhow competition increased development time. At 0.367 mgml\u22121\nin the present study, development time was 6.98 \u00b1 0.13 days at 32 \u00b0C, whereas, at 1 mg larva\u22121 day\u22121 in Huxley et al.9 it was 5.81 \u00b1 0.14 days at 32 \u00b0C.\nThe trait-level responses at our higher resource levels are congruent with studies that have used the trait responses of optimally fed lab strains to predict how vector fitness and disease transmission will respond to climatic warming. In these studies, mosquitoes are expected to develop at ~0.07 individual\u22121 day\u22121\nCOMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | (2022) 5:66 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-022-03030-7 | www.nature.com/commsbio 7\nat 22 \u00b0C; increasing to ~0.14 individual\u22121 day\u22121 at 32 \u00b0C28. In the present study, the development rate (1/development time; Fig. 1b, Table 2) increased by a similar margin when the strength of competition was lessened by high resource availability. In contrast, at low-resource levels, we found juvenile development rate increased from 0.05 day\u22121 at 22 \u00b0C to 0.12 day\u22121 at 32 \u00b0C (Fig. 1b, Table 2). Although these differences in juvenile development rate may appear small, we show that they can have dramatic effects on the temperature dependence of rm when combined with the negative impact of intensified competition on juvenile survival (Fig. 1a, Table 2).\nJuvenile mortality rate increased significantly with temperature and it was consistently higher at low resource levels (Fig. 1a) than at higher resource levels. This is probably because somatic maintenance costs increase with metabolic rate44, which cannot be met below a threshold resource level. Intensified competition at low resource levels is also likely to have contributed to preventing some individuals from meeting this increased energy demand. This explains why juvenile mortality rates were highest at 32 and 34 \u00b0C at low-resource levels (except at 36 \u00b0C where no individuals survived to emergence) where the energy supplydemand deficit was expected to be the largest.\nSince larval competition can mediate the temperature dependence of rm, it is also important to determine the temperature dependence of resource availability itself20. For example, the natural diet of mosquito larvae comprises of detritus and microbial decomposers45, which are both sensitive to temperature46,47. Therefore, shifts in environmental temperature could alter the concentration of food in the environment, which could affect the growth of detritivore populations. While recent studies have provided useful insights into the relationships between microbes, detritus and mosquito vectors48\u201352, future work could focus on the temperature-dependencies of these relationships.\nSuch a focus could provide important insights into how disease vectors and other arthropods will respond to environmental change. For example, if resource availability increases with climatic warming (e.g., due to increases in decomposition and microbial growth rates), its regulatory effect on population growth and abundance could be relaxed through increased juvenile development and adult recruitment rates. Indeed, increased resource availability with warming could contribute to the expansion of disease vectors and other invasive pest species into regions that were previously prohibitive by broadening rm\u2019s thermal niche width23,25. On the other hand, evidence from our high resource level treatments (e.g., a lower Topt at 0.733 than at 0.367 mgml\u22121) may suggest that warming could have a negative impact on population growth by causing resources to be overabundant, which could lead to eutrophication and hypoxia in aquatic environments53.\nAlternatively, if climate change reduces resource availability (e.g., by disrupting temperature-dependent consumer-resource relationships), species\u2019 spatiotemporal ranges could contract20,54. This is because, as we have shown here, intensified competition at low food levels can prevent rm from being positive at lower temperatures, can lower rm Topt, and can force rm to become negative at lower temperatures. In this way, the effects of rising temperatures on vulnerable arthropod populations could be especially pernicious, if resource availability is simultaneously reduced20.\nMore specifically, accounting for the effects of larval competition at low and depleting food levels on the rm thermal niche width would significantly alter projections of how climate change will affect vector-borne disease risk through vector populations. For example, the permissible range for DENV transmission by Ae. aegypti was recently projected to be ~18 \u00b0C (18\u201336 \u00b0C28). In\ncontrast, when larval resources fall below a certain threshold as we measured here, the effects of competition significantly narrow this thermal niche width to just ~8 \u00b0C (23\u201331 \u00b0C, Table 3). This decreased range of temperatures across which positive population growth is expected, is likely to cause dramatic contractions in risk level estimations both spatially and seasonally. Furthermore, it is likely that resource availability is highly variable in the small isolated habitats that mosquitoes typically breed in, which would further decrease the thermal niche width. Thus, our study emphasises the need to develop novel ways of quantifying how resource fluctuations will affect fitness in natural mosquito populations. For example, recently published datasets on the effects of warming temperatures on nitrogen and phosphorus availability55 could help vector-borne disease models to constrain predictions of resource availability in response to nitrogen deposition, elevated CO2 concentrations and climatic warming.\nWe used size-scaling to estimate the effect of temperature and resource level on fecundity, because it is anticipated that most of the effect of intensified larval competition at low-resource levels affects adult mosquitoes indirectly by reducing size at emergence and lifespan56,57. Despite these assumptions, we show that substantial error in our fecundity estimates would not alter our main conclusions. This is because predicted fitness was relatively insensitive to these traits (Figs. 3 and 4).\nRapid global change is expected to have far-reaching and disruptive ecological impacts58. Climate-driven shifts in the spatiotemporal distributions and abundances of organisms are likely to cause widespread harm to ecosystems, biodiversity and society26,59. This concern has prompted calls for a more complete understanding of how interactions between environmental factors can affect population-level responses20,27,60. Attempts to understand the population-level effects of temperature \u00d7 resource interactions have focused on prokaryotes or have not considered competition in depleting resource environments. Our study provides rare evidence of how intensified competition below certain resource thresholds can affect the temperature dependence of fitness in a predictable and generalisable way."

These experimental temperatures span the range of temperatures that this strain of Ae. aegypti (F16-19 originating from Fort Meyer, FL61; is likely to experience in the wild between May (the onset of mosquito season) and November62. We extended our range to 36 \u00b0C to determine the upper critical thermal limit for this strain. Our resource levels are within the range of studies that have investigated the effects of depleting larval resource environments on Ae. aegypti18. Our lowest resource level (0.183 mgml\u22121) was chosen to simulate a level of resource limitation that is expected in natural juvenile habitats15,16. Further, our preliminary assays showed that resource levels below 0.183 mgml\u22121 resulted in complete juvenile mortality.\nThe experiment was carried out in two randomised blocks. Each block consisted of all five temperatures and two resource levels. On Day 0 of each block, batches of ~800 eggs were deposited into five (one per experimental temperature) plastic tubs containing 300 ml of dechlorinated tap water. We provided each tub with a pinch of powdered fish food (Cichlid Gold\u00ae, Hikari, Kyrin Food Industries Ltd., Japan) to prompt overnight hatching. Tubs were randomly assigned to a water bath (Grant Instruments: JAB Academy) set at one of the five experimental temperatures. Water baths were situated in a 20 \u00b0C climate-controlled insectary with a 12L:12D photoperiod and 30 min of gradual transition of light levels to simulate sunrise and sunset. On the following day (Day 1), we created the treatments by separating first instar larvae were into cohorts of 50, which were then transferred to clean tubs containing 300 ml of fresh water. Each treatment comprised of three replicate tubs (3 \u00d7 50 individuals treatment\u22121). Resource levels were attained by adding 55, 110, 165 and 220 mg of powdered fish food to the tubs, respectively. While natural larval habitats are expected to receive infrequent resource inputs, they are likely to receive some nutritional deposits (e.g., plant material, insects) during the course of a cohort\u2019s development period. We attempted to simulate this aspect, and also allow for realistic resource depletion, by allocating food in two pulses. Half of the assigned quantity was provided on Day 1; the remaining half was provided on Day 4. After Day 4, resource levels were not adjusted but water volumes were topped up, if necessary. We also allocated resources in this way because fouling caused\n8 COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | (2022) 5:66 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-022-03030-7 | www.nature.com/commsbio\ncomplete juvenile mortality in our preliminary assays when the high resource treatments (165 and 220 mg) received all of their assigned quantities on Day 1 or after Day 4.\nFitness calculation. We calculated rm using a stage-structured matrix projection model (MPM), which describes change in a population over time (Eq. 163)\nNt\u00fe1 \u00bc MNt \u00f01\u00de\nwhere Nt is a vector of abundances in the stage classes at time t and M is the projection matrix. The first row of M is populated with daily fecundity rate (the number of female offspring produced per female at age i). The sub-diagonal of M (Eq. 1) is populated with the survival proportions from age I to age i+ 1. Multiplying Nt and M sequentially across time intervals gives the stage-structured population dynamics. When the stable stage distribution of Nt is reached, the dominant eigenvalue of the system is the finite population rate of increase (\u03bb)63. The intrinsic rate of population growth is then rm= log(\u03bb); a population\u2019s inherent capacity to reproduce, and therefore a measure of population-level fitness5,64,65. Positive and negative rm values indicate growth and decline, respectively. We used the \u2018popbio\u2019 R package to build and analyse the MPMs66,67."

            "text": "Immature development time and immature and adult survival proportions. The survival proportions for the matrix survival elements (the sub-diagonal ofM; Eq. 1) were estimated using the \u2018survival\u2019 R package68. We defined the juvenile stage duration (i.e., hatching-to-adult) as the mean duration of transitioning into and out of that stage, and a fixed age of adult emergence at the mean age of emergence.\nJuvenile development times for each treatment\u2019s MPM were predicted using a regression model (detailed in the \u2018Statistics and Reproducibility section) that was parametrised with individual-level hatching-to-adult times (days). Upon pupation, mosquitoes were transferred to individual falcon tubes containing 5 ml of tap water, which allowed pupa-to-adult development times and the lifespans of individual starved adults to be recorded. In the absence of food, adult lifespan is positively associated with emergent size, so it is a useful indicator of the carry over effects of temperature and competition in the larval habitat56,69. Larval development, pupation and mortality (juvenile and adult) were recorded daily.\nDaily fecundity rate. Fecundity and body size are positively related in many insect taxa, including mosquitoes70. For this reason, scaling relationships between fecundity and size are commonly used in predictions of population growth in Aedes71,72. We provide a detailed description of our method for estimating fecundity in Supplementary Note 1. Briefly, we measured individual dry mass, and estimated lifetime fecundity using previously published datasets on the temperature-dependent scaling between mass and wing length73, and wing length and fecundity56,74. Temperature-specific individual daily fecundity rate is required for the MPMs (Eq. 1), so we divided lifetime fecundity by lifespan and multiplied by 0.5 (assuming a 1:1 offspring sex ratio). Later, we show that this much variation in the scaling of fecundity does not qualitatively change our results.\nParameter sensitivity. We used the standard errors of the survival and fecundity element estimates to account for how uncertainty in these traits is propagated through to the rm estimate63,75. For survival, we used the standard errors estimated by the Kaplan\u2013Meier survival function in the \u2018survival\u2019 R package. For fecundity, we calculated the standard errors of the mean daily fecundity rates (Supplementary Table 2) for each treatment using the \u2018Rmisc\u2019 R package76. As an additional sensitivity analysis, we recalculated fitness using the upper and lower 95% CIs of the exponents for the scaling of size and lifetime fecundity (Fig. 3).\nElasticity analysis. We used elasticities to quantify the relative contributions of individual life history traits to rm. Elasticity, eij, measures the proportional effect on \u03bb of an infinitesimal change in an element ofM (Eq. 1) with all other elements held constant (the partial derivative)77,78. This partial derivative of \u03bb, with respect to each element ofM, is sij= \u2202\u03bb/\u2202aij= viwj with the dot product \u2329w, v\u232a= 1. Here, w is the dominant right eigenvector (the stage distribution vector of M), v is the dominant left eigenvector (the reproductive value vector of M), and aij is the i \u00d7 jth element of M. Elasticities can then be calculated using the relationship: eij= aij/\u03bb \u00d7 sij. Multiplying an elasticity by \u03bb gives the absolute contribution of its corresponding aij to \u03bb77,78. Absolute contributions for juvenile and adult elements were summed and changed proportionally to quantify the sensitivity of rm to these traits.\nStatistics and reproducibility. In the first instance, we used mixed effects models in the \u2018lme4\u2019 R package79 to test for significant effects of our predictor variables on fitness traits. In the maximal models, temperature \u00d7 resource level and replicate were fixed effect predictors and block was a random effect. However, the lower AIC scores from versions of the maximal model suggested that variation among replicates within blocks had a non-significant effect on trait responses. Therefore, for normally distributed trait data (adult lifespan and size), we used a full factorial linear regression model (LM) with temperature \u00d7 resource level and replicate as fixed effects. Model diagnostics provided no evidence to suggest the development\ntime data were normally distributed, so we used a generalised linear model (GLM) with family= gamma and link= identity.\nWe tested the effect of resource level on the temperature dependence of daily per capita juvenile mortality rate by fitting an exponential function to the survival data with R package \u2018flexsurv\u201932. The final mortality model was obtained by dropping terms from the full model (consisting of temperature \u00d7 resource level+ replicate+ block as fixed effect predictors). Terms were retained unless their removal worsened model fit (\u0394AIC > \u20122) (Supplementary Table 1). Maximum likelihood methods executed in \u2018flexsurv\u2019 were used to estimate treatment-level juvenile mortality rates and their 95% CIs. Significant effects were interpreted when CIs were nonoverlapping.\nQuantifying the rm thermal performance curve. To determine how resource depletion affected the shape of the rm TPC, we fitted several mathematical models that allow for negative values at both cold and hot extremes, including polynomial models using linear regression, as well as non-linear models with non-linear least squares (NLLS) using the \u2018rTPC\u2019 R package80. Overall, the Lactin281 and Kamykowski82 models were equally best-fitting according to the AIC (Supplementary Table 2). From these, we picked the Kamykowski model (Eq. 2) because it was better at describing the estimated rm at our lowest resource level. This model is defined as\nrm\u00f0T\u00de \u00bc a\u00f01 e b\u00f0T Tmin\u00de\u00de\u00f01 e c\u00f0Tmax T\u00de\u00de; \u00f02\u00de where T (\u00b0C), and Tmax and Tmin are the high and low temperatures at which rm becomes negative, respectively, and a, b, and c, are shape parameters without any biological meaning. Bootstrapping was used to calculate 95% prediction bounds for each rm TPC80 and confidence intervals (CIs) around its Topt, as well as the thermal niche width (Tmax \u2012 Tmin).\nReporting summary.
