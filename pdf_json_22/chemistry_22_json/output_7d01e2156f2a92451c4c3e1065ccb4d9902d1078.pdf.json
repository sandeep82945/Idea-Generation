    "abstractText": "Novel phosphate compound potassium magnesium-aluminum double phosphate with chemical formula of KMgAl(PO4)2 has been synthesized. Platelet-shaped single crystals have been grown from the flux using K2Mo2O7 as a solvent. The powder form has been obtained through a sol-gel reaction. It has been characterized by X-ray diffraction, SEM, FTIR and optical spectroscopy, as well as electronic structure calculations. KMgAl(PO4)2 crystallizes in the trigonal centrosymmetric space group P3\u0305m1 (No. 164) with the unit cell parameters a = b = 5.347(1) \u00c5, c = 7.903(10) \u00c5, \u03b3 = 120\u00b0 (Z = 1). The major characteristic of the crystal is the two-dimensional (2D) lamellar framework formed by Mg|AlO4 and PO4 tetrahedrons sharing their vertices of oxygen atoms, with the K cations located within the interlayer space. The sample morphology and chemical composition were revealed by the SEM EDX analysis. The IR spectroscopy of KMgAl(PO4)2 confirmed the existence of a single PO4 group in agreement with the structural study. A relatively large indirect band gap of 3.86 eV was determined.",

            "text": "Inorganic phosphates constitute an important class of materials, which have received\nwidespread interest in recent years. They have been deeply studied regarding their structural diversity originating from the way in which the P-O phosphate group associates with an alkali or alkaline rare-earth ion (A) and / or a metal ion (M) to form a stable AMPO oxide. Hence, dissimilar crystalline structure has been engendered a two-dimensional (2D) layer or a threedimensional (3D) framework with hexagonal, rectangular or triangular tunnels containing the alkali cations. These frameworks can be either purely tetrahedral (PO4 / MO4) or made up of several types of polyhedrons (e.g., PO4 / MO4, MO5 or MO6) especially in the case of M adopting several coordinations ranging from four to six, such as in the case of iron and aluminum in oxides [1, 2, 3].\nAluminum phosphates find potential applications as ionic conductors [4, 5, 6], optical\nmaterials [7] and catalyzers [8, 9, 10]. Lithium aluminum titanium phosphate (Li1.3Al0.3Ti1.7(PO4)3, LATP) which can be synthesized by different methods has been widely studied due to its high density and an ionic conductivity of 1.88\u00d710\u22124 S\u22c5cm\u22121 at room temperature\n[11]. Other compounds such as Rb3Al2(PO4)3 and K3Al2(PO4)3 [12] appeared as promising materials for second harmonic generation with efficiencies comparable to that of KH2PO4 (KDP). Regarding luminescent materials, Na3Al2(PO4)3 doped with Ce3+ ions exhibited a broadband UV emission at 328 nm [13] while under doping with Eu3+ and Mn2+, it gave rise to emissions in the red and green spectral ranges, at 615 nm and 515 nm, respectively. The (NH4)3Al2(PO4)3 and Al2(PO4)2(OH)2(NH4)2-x(H3O)x compounds [14] were proved to be of interest as selective and active heterogeneous solid catalysts for the Friedel-Crafts acylation and acetalization reactions. These catalysts were found to be stable, and they could be recycled more than four times without significant loss of reactivity.\nRecently, the AMIIAl(PO4)2 system, where A is an alkali cation and MII is a transition\nmetal, has been studied with several reported compounds. They are classified depending on their structural type based on the metal coordination (six or four). The KCuAl(PO4)2 [15] and RbCuAl(PO4)2 [16] compounds exhibit 3D structures formed by CuO6 octahedrons sharing a common edge to form zigzag chains connected to a AlO5 polyhedron and PO4 tetrahedrons through corners and an edge. The compounds KCoAl(PO4)2 [17], NH4(Al,Co)2(PO4)2 [18], KZnAl(PO4)2 and \u03b2-NaZnAl(PO4)2 [19], (NH4)0,83(Zn0,83Al1,17)(PO4)2 [20] and \u03b1-NaZnAl(PO4)2 [21] adopted a 3D structural framework formed entirely by tetrahedrons.\nIn the present work, we report on the synthesis and characterization of a novel compound\nwithin the AMIIAl(PO4)2 system owing to the relevance of this phosphate family of materials, in particular, potassium magnesium aluminum phosphate, KMgAl(PO4)2."

Appropriate amounts of K(NO3) (purity: 99%), Mg(NO3)\u00b76H2O (98.5%), Al(NO3)3\u00b79H2O (99%), (NH4)2HPO4 (99%) and (NH4)6Mo7O24\u00b74H2O (99%) were dissolved in an acidulate solution. The obtained solution was evaporated to dryness\nat 100 \u00b0C. The resulting dried residue was ground in an agate mortar to get a homogenous mixture and progressively heated in a platinum crucible between 200 \u00b0C and 600 \u00b0C to release H2O, NH3 and NO2 gases. Then, it was reground, melted for 1 h at 1150 \u00b0C and subsequently cooled at a rate of 10 \u00b0C/h down to 600 \u00b0C before switching off the furnace. After being boiled in water to dissolve the flux, colorless crystals were extracted.\nThe powder form was prepared by a sol-gel reaction in air using stoichiometric amounts of\nthe K(NO3), Mg(NO3)\u00b76H2O, Al(NO3)3\u00b79H2O and (NH4)2HPO4 reagents. At first, these reagents were dissolved in an acidulate solution, followed by an addition of citric acid (CA) to engender the complexation of the metal cations. After that, appropriate amounts of ethylene glycol (EG) were added (the EG:CA molar ratio was 1:1) to obtain a gel. The gel became a resin after heating at 80 \u00b0C for 1 h. During continued heating at 140\u2013150 \u00b0C for 1 h, the solution became more and more viscous and finally became a xerogel. To complete drying, the xerogel was calcined at 250 \u00b0C for 1 h. The resulting powder was heated in a furnace at 400\u2013600 \u00b0C for 12 h using a platinum crucible, and then was cooled down to room temperature. The resulting mixture was ground in an agate mortar to give a homogenous material and finally annealed at 1050 \u00b0C for 12 h, after which the furnace was turned off and a fine white powder was obtained.\nThe structure and the phase purity of the synthesized powder sample was examined using\na Philips X\u2019Pert automated diffractometer with Ni-filtered Cu-K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb = 1.5406 \u00c5). The chemical composition and the morphology were revealed by a scanning electron microscope (SEM, S-4800, Hitachi) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometer. The thermal analysis (TGA-DTA) was carried out using a Rigaku TG-DTA-PIMS410/s instrument. The measurements were conducted between 22 and 1400 \u00b0C at a heating rate of 10 \u00b0C/min. The experiment was performed in an alumina crucible under nitrogen atmosphere. The infrared (IR) spectra were measured in the wavenumber range of 400 - 1800 cm-1 using a Perkin Elmer Paragon 1000 PC Fourier spectrometer. The UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra at 200\u20132000 nm were measured at room temperature using a BaSO4 powder as a reference (100% reflectance) on a Perkin Elmer Lamda-950 UV/VIS/NIR spectrophotometer.\nThe calculations of the electronic structure based on the density function theory (DFT)\nwere carried out using the Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package (CASTEP) [22] module implemented in Materials Studio software. The crystallographic data (the lattice parameters and the atomic coordinates) obtained in the present paper were used in the input configuration of the calculation process. The cut-off energy Ecut of the plane wave base was fixed at 700 eV. The exchange-correlation function was adopted as the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) [23] format. A 1\u00d71\u00d71 single cell of KMgAl(PO4)2 was adopted to present the crystal structure. The Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh was specified as 7\u00d77\u00d77. The criterion for the self-consistency field (SCF) was the convergence of Eigen energies to within 10-6 eV\u22c5atom-1.\nThe single-crystal XRD data were collected at room temperature by an Enraf Nonius Turbo\nCAD4 diffractometer using monochromatic Mo K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb = 0.7107 \u00c5) and \u03c9/2\u03b8 scans. A platelet-shaped single-crystal of KMgAl(PO4)2 with the dimensions of 0.7\u00d70.18\u00d70.45 mm3 was used. The unit cell parameters were determined from the refinement of 25 reflections measured in the angular range of 9.2\u00b0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 17.6\u00b0. A total of 191 reflections were measured in the (-6 \u2264 h\n\u2264 6; -1\u2264 k \u2264 6; -1\u2264 l \u2264 10) hemisphere (Rin = 0.096). Only 166 of them were considered as the observed ones according to the statistical criterion [I > 2\u03c3(I)]. All the measured intensities were corrected for the Lorentz polarization effect. The absorption corrections were made by the RefDelf (XABS2) method [24], leading to the transmission factors of Tmin = 0.54 and Tmax = 0.92. The resolution and the refinement of the structure were carried out using the WinGX software package [25]. The structure was solved by the direct methods using the SIR-92 program [26].\nTo confirm the chemical formula of the crystal resulting from the analysis of the XRD data,\na calculation of the distribution charge (CHARDI) was carried out using the Chardi-IT-2015 program [27]."

Successive refinement of difference Fourier syntheses using SHELXL-97 program [28] allowed us to localize distinctive position for P, Al and two oxygen atoms, while the Mg atoms have not been identified. For this cause, the examination of the values of Al-O interatomic distances and the residual electron density imposed the hypothesis of the co-existence of Mg2+ and Al3+ in the same crystallographic position due to their close ionic radii, R(Mg2+) = 0.66 \u00c5 and R(Al3+) = 0.51 \u00c5 for IV-fold oxygen coordination [29]. Considering this hypothesis, a final refinement cycle including atomic coordinates and anisotropic displacement parameters led to the reliability factors of R1 = 0.056, wR2 = 0.138 and S = 1.23. The experimental conditions for single-crystal XRD measurements, the structure solution and the refinement are reported in Table 1.\nKMgAl(PO4)2 crystallizes in the trigonal class (space group P3\u0305m1 \u2013 D33d, No. 164) and its\nlattice constants are a = b = 5.347(1) \u00c5, c = 7.903(10) \u00c5, \u03b1 = \u03b2 = 90\u00b0, \u03b3 = 120\u00b0 (the number of the formula units in the unit-cell Z = 1), the volume of the unit-cell V is 195.68(9) \u00c53 and the calculated density \u03c1calc is 2.379 g/cm3.

The CHARDI validation\nmodels, with a cationic dispersion factor of 0.1%, and an anionic dispersion factor of 0.4%, validate this structural model. The bond valence sum calculation is in good agreement with the formal oxidation and with the calculated charge Q(i).\nThe phase purity of the obtained powdered sample was confirmed using powder XRD. The\nmeasured powder XRD pattern is shown in Fig. 2, together with the results of the Rietveld refinement using the WinPLOTR/Fullprof program [30].

The twodimensional framework in these materials is built by staking of [MgM(PO4)2]- (where M = Al or Fe) layers along the b-axis, Fig. 6(a-c). Each layer is formed by sharing vertices between the MO4 (M = 0.5(Al or Fe) + 0.5Mg) and PO4 tetrahedrons. The structures involve large hexagonal tunnels formed by rings of alternating sharing vertices MO4 and PO4 polyhedrons, with alkali metal atoms (K) located inside these tunnels. The tunnels are regular in KMgAl(PO4)2 and RbMgFe(PO4)2 and deformed in KMgFe(PO4)2 and they are oriented along the [001] and [101] directions, respectively, as shown in Fig. 7(a-c).\nThe interatomic distances and angles in MO4 (M = Al, Mg), PO4 and KO12 polyhedrons\nfor KMgAl(PO4)2 are summarized in Table 4. The MO4 tetrahedrons have three equal M\u2212O distances of 1.808(4) \u00c5 and one of 1.795(5) \u00c5. For these tetrahedrons, the M-O bonds are much longer than those (Al-O) observed typically for AlO4 (1.71 \u00c5) [33, 34] and much shorter than those (Mg-O) for MgO4 (1.96 \u00c5) [35, 36]. This results in abnormal value of the calculated distribution charge, +2.5 for Mg and Al cations. In addition, such values of M-O distances support the mixing of Mg and Al atoms in the 2d sites (Fig.8(a)). The angles O-M-O are between 106.34(1)\u00b0 (\u00d73) and 112.47(1)\u00b0 (\u00d73). Similarly, the PO4 tetrahedrons, (Fig.8(b)), have three P-O distances of 1.512(4) \u00c5 and one of 1.509(5) \u00c5, which are comparable to the P-O distance of\n1.537 \u00c5 suggested by Baur for monophosphates [37] and also agree with the P-O bond lengths varying from 1.502(2) \u00c5 to 1.557(2) \u00c5 in KZnAl(PO4)2 and \u03b2-NaZnAl(PO4)2 compounds [19]. The O-P-O bond angles are ranging from 108.42(11)\u00b0 (\u00d73) to 110.52(12)\u00b0 (\u00d73). Consequently, the tetrahedral geometry of PO4 and MO4 exhibits axial distortion resulting from the cornersharing PO4 and MO4 tetrahedrons. The environment of K consists of 12 oxygen atoms O(2), see Fig.8(c), with K-O(2) distances of 3.168(2) \u00c5 in agreement with the limit of the K-O bond length of 3.33 \u00c5 suggested by Donnay and Allmann [38]."

The obtained spectrum is similar to those for monophosphates and the assignment of the observed bands to vibration modes was performed following the previous studies [32, 39]. The bands in the range of 1228-1085 cm-1 are attributed to antisymmetric triply degenerate P-O stretching mode (\u03bd3). The band at 997 cm-1 is assigned to symmetric P-O stretching (\u03bd1). The asymmetric triply degenerate (\u03bd4) and symmetric doubly degenerate (\u03bd2) OP-O bending modes appear in the ranges of 659-561 cm-1 and 498-400 cm-1, respectively. The single observed band corresponding to the symmetric P-O stretching confirms the presence of a single PO4 group in agreement with the structural study.\nThe first-principles calculations for the KMgAl(PO4)2 crystal were performed by the plane-\nwave pseudopotential method. Figure 10(a) displays the obtained band structure. KMgAl(PO4)2 is an indirect bandgap semiconductor, as its maximum energy state in the valence band (VB) and its minimum energy state in the conduction band (CB) both appear at different points of the Brillouin zone as displayed in Fig. 10(b). The calculated energy gap Eg,calc for KMgAl(PO4)2 is 3.34 eV. To verify the DFT calculation results, the UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra of KMgAl(PO4)2 were measured; they are shown in Fig. 10(c). The crystal exhibits strong absorption in the range of 200-300 nm due to the Mg|Al-O charge transfer.\nThe optical bandgap Eg can be determined by the following equations [40,41]:\n\ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc45)\u210e\ud835\udf08 = \ud835\udc34(\u210e\ud835\udf08 \u2212 \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc54)\ud835\udc5b, (1a) \ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc45) = (1 \u2212 \ud835\udc45)2/2\ud835\udc45, (1b)\nwhere F(R) is the Kubelka-Munk function, A is a constant, R is the reflectivity of the sample, h\u03bd is the photon energy and n = 2 for indirect allowed transitions. From this analysis, we achieve Eg of 3.86 eV, cf. Fig. 10(d), close to the values reported previously for KZnAl(PO4)2 (Eg = 3.76 eV) and \u03b2-NaZnAl(PO4)2 (Eg = 3.70 eV) compounds [19]. The optical bandgap for KMgAl(PO4)2 is slightly higher than the calculated value due to the discontinuity of the exchange correlation energy function [42].\nThe composition of the calculated energy band structure is further resolved by the total\n(TDOS) and partial density of states (PDOS), as shown in Fig. 11(a-f). The top of the VB, as well as the bottom of the CB band mainly originate from the p-orbitals of the O2- atoms and the p-orbitals of the Al3+|Mg2+ atoms, respectively, with a few contributions from the p-orbitals of the P5+ atoms. In addition, strong hybridizations of the Mg2+ and O2- orbitals in the energy range of -10 to 0 eV in the VB suggests strong covalent bonding characteristic of the Mg-O bond."

            "text": "To conclude, a novel aluminophosphate, KMgAl(PO4)2, was synthesized both by flux\ngrowth and sol-gel reaction and its structure was determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The main feature of this compound is a two-dimensional structure with hexagonal tunnels running along the c-axis formed by metal (Mg|Al)O4 and PO4 tetrahedrons connected by sharing corner oxygen atoms, and alkali metal atoms distributed inside these tunnels. The twodimensional framework is built by staking of [MgM(PO4)2]- (where M = Al or Fe) layers in the a-b plane, which determines a perfect cleavage feature and a platelet-like shape of the singlecrystals. The IR spectrum confirms the structure analysis. The combination of DFT calculation and the UV-visible reflectance measurements indicate that KMgAl(PO4)2 is an indirect band gap (3.86 eV) semiconductor. The calculation of partial densities of states indicates that the Al|Mg\u2212O groups play the major role in the electron transitions of the studied compound. The layered structure of KMgAl(PO4)2 is promising for intercalation of sodium and lithium ions in the interlayer space which will be a source of important ionic conductivity."
