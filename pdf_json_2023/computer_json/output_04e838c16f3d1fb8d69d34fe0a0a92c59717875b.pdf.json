    "abstractText": "Language models are achieving impressive performance on various tasks by aggressively adopting inference-time prompting techniques, such as zero-shot and few-shot prompting. In this work, we introduce EchoPrompt, a simple yet effective approach that prompts the model to rephrase its queries before answering them. EchoPrompt is adapted for both zero-shot and few-shot in-context learning with standard and chain-of-thought prompting. Experimental results show that EchoPrompt yields substantial improvements across all these settings for four families of causal language models. These improvements are observed across various numerical reasoning (e.g. GSM8K, SVAMP), reading comprehension (e.g. DROP), and logical reasoning (e.g. Coin Flipping) tasks. On average, EchoPrompt improves the Zero-shot-CoT performance of code-davinci-002 by 5% in numerical tasks and 13% in reading comprehension tasks. We investigate the factors contributing to EchoPrompt\u2019s effectiveness through ablation studies, which reveal that both the original query and the model-generated rephrased version are instrumental in its performance gains. Our empirical results indicate that EchoPrompt is an effective technique that enhances in-context learning performance. We recommend incorporating EchoPrompt into various baseline prompting strategies to achieve performance boosts.",

This technique involves conditioning the language model with an instruction (zero-shot) or augmenting the prompt with a small set of taskspecific examples (few-shot), resulting in the model to generalize and respond effectively to tasks.\nA rapidly advancing body of research has introduced techniques to enhance these prompting methodologies. Notably, chain-of-thought prompt-\nQ: Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. If she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, how many cents will she have left?\nZero-Shot-CoT A: Let's think step by step. Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. So, she has 5 quarters and 2 dimes left. 5 quarters = 5 x 25 cents = 125 cents and 2 dimes = 2 x 10 cents = 20 cents. So, she has 125 + 20 = 145 cents left. Therefore, the answer is 145 cents. \u2717\nZero-Shot-CoT + EchoPrompt A: Let's repeat the question and also think step by step. Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. She buys a can of pop for 55 cents. How many cents will she have left? Let's start with the first step. Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. We can represent this as: 5 quarters = 5 x 25 cents = 125 cents. 2 dimes = 2 x 10 cents = 20 cents. So, Kelly has 125 + 20 = 145 cents. She buys a can of pop for 55 cents. We can represent this as: 55 cents. So, Kelly has 145 - 55 = 90 cents left. Therefore, the answer is 90 cents. \u2714\nFigure 1: Comparison of prompts in Zero-shot-CoT with and without EchoPrompt, highlighting the modification in prompts. Zero-shot-CoT with EchoPrompt uses the prompt \u201cLet\u2019s repeat the question and also think step by step\u201d to aid the model in recalling the query before solving it.\ning (Wei et al., 2023; Kojima et al., 2022) has emerged as a powerful method for enhancing language model performance in reasoning tasks. Least-to-most prompting (Zhou et al., 2022a) and Tree of Thoughts (Yao et al., 2023) further support chain-of-thought by breaking down complex problems into simpler subproblems.\nWhile both standard prompting and chain-ofthought prompting exhibit impressive capabilities and find applications across various domains, they can sometimes lead to inaccurate responses due to logical errors, symbol mapping issues, and omission of intermediate steps (Kojima et al., 2022), indicating potential oversights in adequately addressing various facets of the queries.\nIn this paper, we propose EchoPrompt, a prompting strategy that builds upon existing prompting approaches by incorporating Query-Rephrasing as\nar X\niv :2\n30 9.\n10 68\n7v 2\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n3 O\nct 2\n02 3\na preliminary task in the in-context learning process. EchoPrompt draws inspiration from the innate cognitive strategies employed by humans, precisely the act of self-questioning, when answering queries. By verbalizing queries before answering them, humans establish a cognitive checkpoint to refine their thoughts, uncovering misconceptions that might have otherwise gone unnoticed (Joseph and Ross, 2018; Joseph et al., 2019). Figure 1 provides an illustrative example of EchoPrompting in Zero-shot-CoT settings. While the approach proposed by (Kojima et al., 2022) uses the prompt \u201cLet\u2019s think step by step.\" to elicit chain-of-thought reasoning and then extracts the answer using the prompt \u201cTherefore, the answer is\", we modify the first prompt to \u201cLet\u2019s repeat the question and also think step by step.\" or similar texts. This modification guides the model to generate a version of the original query before solving it.\nWe empirically evaluate our approach against various prompting baselines using a wide variety of model families with different sizes, including code-davinci-002, GPT-3.5-Turbo1, Starcoder15B, Llama-13B, and GPT-J-6B. Our results show that EchoPrompt significantly improves the performance of language models on arithmetic, reading comprehension, and logical reasoning tasks. We observe substantial performance gains with both standard and chain-of-thought prompting, particularly in zero-shot scenarios for large language models (code-davinci-002, GPT-3.5-turbo) and with standard prompting on smaller models (Starcoder15B, Llama-13B, and GPT-J-6B). For example, EchoPrompt increases the Zero-shot-CoT performance from 56.8% to 67.3% on DROP (Census) and from 75.1% to 82.6% on GSM8K with chainof-thought prompting on GPT-3.5(gpt-3.5-turbo).\nWe conduct a series of ablation studies to gain deeper insights into the effectiveness of the EchoPrompt technique. First, we examine whether the accuracy gains attributed to EchoPrompt resulted solely from rephrased queries. Our findings demonstrate that both the original query and the rephrased query are essential in achieving performance improvements. Next, we investigate whether EchoPrompt can be seen as a query augmentation technique by considering the alternative approach of directly augmenting the original query with a rephrased version. We observe com-\n1https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/. We use gpt-3.5turbo-0301 snapshot from March 2023\nparable results between these two approaches, indicating that EchoPrompt serves as a query augmentation technique. Additionally, we explore whether instructing EchoPrompt to generate multiple rephrases can further enhance performance. Interestingly, we observe a slight performance drop as the number of rephrases increases. This suggests that the improvements achieved with EchoPrompt cannot be solely attributed to generating more tokens. Finally, we assess the performance of EchoPrompt in the presence of irrelevant text within the queries and find that it maintains improvements despite replicating irrelevant text in the rephrases. Our study indicates that EchoPrompt fundamentally improves in-context learning performance and finds broad applicability as a building block in emerging complex techniques that leverage prompting in multiple stages."

In contrast, Zero-shot EchoPrompt introduces a two-stage prompting process. The language model is initially instructed to rephrase the query using a task-agnostic prompt, \u201cLet\u2019s repeat the question. \u201c\" and then the answer is extracted using the same prompt as in zero-shot prompting.\nSimilarly, in Zero-shot-CoT, as proposed by (Kojima et al., 2022), the conventional approach involves using the prompt \u201cLet\u2019s think step by step.\" to guide the model in generating its reasoning steps before producing the final answer. However, in Zero-shot-CoT with EchoPrompt, we introduce a query-rephrasing subtask by employing prompts like \u201cLet\u2019s repeat the question and also think step by step.\". This modification encourages the model to generate the query in its own words and then engage in multi-hop reasoning.

The exemplars in the standard prompting approach (highlighted in blue) demonstrate a sample query and the corresponding answering format. Consequently, when the model is presented with a test query, it responds similarly. However, with the introduction of EchoPrompt, the exemplars now showcase an additional step: query-rephrasing. Consequently, when the model encounters a test query, it produces a rephrased variant and answers it using the original and generated query reformulation."

Although these approaches are not directly tied to the EchoPrompt technique, they utilize chain-of-thought prompting, where we have shown that EchoPrompt exhibits promising results, particularly in zero-shot scenarios. In the domain of outcome correction, approaches such as (Jung et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023; Yao et al., 2023; Miao et al., 2021; Xie et al., 2023) leverage consistency among multiple generated rationales while (Weng et al., 2023; Khalifa et al., 2023; Yang and Klein, 2021; Ni et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2022) prioritize the ranking of plausible generations to enhance performance across arithmetic, reasoning, and code-generation tasks. Building upon these foundations, self-correction methodologies like (Madaan et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023; Hao et al., 2023; Shinn et al., 2023), which employ feedback loops for refinement and multi-agent debating strategies (Du et al., 2023; Cohen et al., 2023; Fu et al., 2023) have evolved.
