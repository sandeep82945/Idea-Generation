"The present study case aimed to fill a gap in the literature regarding knowledge of the experience of the practice of PA, PE and sports in trans individuals. This study aimed to help create more inclusive and safer spaces for the practice of PE and sports, explicitly considering the higher levels of sedentary behaviors and the lower practice of PE and sports of the entire population. Thus, some barriers were identified in the present study, which can also be found in a recent systematic review of the topic by Oliveira et al. [13]."

"In an increasingly inclusive world, where barriers are being broken down, and it is becoming easier to assume oneâ€™s gender identity, it is possible that the number of difficulties for trans individuals to participate in PE and sporting activities will increase. Thus, it is of the utmost importance to better understand the specific challenges that a transgender individual may experience when engaging in sports activities and PE. This study draws attention to research questions that should be further explored. It is important that future studies look into these issues, so that exercise and sports are safe practices for all individuals and enjoyable moments. This way, their benefits (not only physical but also psychological) will be enhanced."

"Despite its contributions to research and practical implications, this study has some limitations that should be acknowledged, and that can guide future research. Firstly, as a case study, the present study only analyzed the experiences of one trans individual and cannot be generalized, which means that the results should not be generalized to the entire trans community. Secondly, this study only provided the perspective of trans men in its specific context. Finally, the inclusion of people surrounding the trans individuals (e.g., coaches, fitness and sports managers, physical education teachers, etc.)"
