 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct genetic testing on more patients with both melanoma and glioblastoma to identify common genetic mutations. The paper focused on CDKN2A mutations, but testing a wider range of genes could reveal new shared genetic factors. 

2. Investigate the role of non-coding mutations in the melanoma-glioblastoma syndrome. The paper suggests non-coding regions of CDKN2A could be involved, so research on intronic/regulatory mutations could provide insights.

3. Explore the effects of radiation therapy on melanoma development in glioblastoma patients. The paper proposes radiotherapy as a risk factor for melanoma - this could be examined more directly.

4. Study signaling pathways shared by melanoma and glioblastoma. The paper mentions common embryonic precursors and pathways. Research to identify the specific shared pathways could elucidate mechanisms.

5. Develop animal models of the melanoma-glioblastoma syndrome. Generating mouse models with genetic mutations linked to both cancers could allow more detailed study of disease progression and response to treatments.
