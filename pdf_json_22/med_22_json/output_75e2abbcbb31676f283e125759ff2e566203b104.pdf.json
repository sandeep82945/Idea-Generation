Our prior research demonstrated that the chemical species of antioxidants have a substantial effect on their antiradical action under physiological settings.30\u201332 In order to identify the dissociation states of Wal in aqueous environments, the pKa value was calculated by isodesmic processes and thermochemical cycles.33,34\nTaking into account all of the potential routes of deprotonation (see Fig. 2), Wal is polyphenol with three OH functional groups, and its dissociation in water follows this order: At pKa1 \u00bc 8.71, the rst proton loss process occurred at the OH in position 2, producing an H2W\n\u2212 anion; the second deprotonation step at pKa2 \u00bc 14.59, associated with the OH in position 1, created the HW2\u2212 specie. Finally, the W3\u2212 specie was formed by the H+ loss of the benzene ring's nal OH group, and the relative pKa3 value was 25.11. In water solvent at pH \u00bc 7.4, only neutral (H3W) and anion (H2W\n\u2212) forms of Wal exist in molar fractions (f) of 0.942 and 0.058, respectively (see Table 1).\n3.1.2 Thermochemical analyses. Several commonly used mechanisms for evaluating the radical scavenging ability of antioxidant compounds are FHT \u2013 formal hydrogen transfer, SETPT \u2013 single electron transfer followed by proton transfer, SPLET \u2013 sequential proton loss electron transfer, and RAF \u2013\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

As a result, both SETPT and SPLET can be reduced to single electron transfer (SET) routes. Furthermore, previous studies have shown that a localized C]C bond and an aromatic ring are unfavorable to the RAF process.36\u201338 Therefore, in this work, the FHT and the SET were chosen as the two primary mechanisms to clarify the link between the structural features of Wal and its antioxidant activity.\nAs noted previously, all the states formed from the acid\u2013base equilibria in a water solvent need to be considered for evaluation of the HOOc radical scavenging capacity of Wal via two key mechanisms as follows (eqn (1)\u2013(4)):\nFHT (Formal Hydro Transfer)\nH3W + HOOc / H2Wc + H2O2 (1)\nH2W \u2212 + HOOc / HWc\u2212 + H2O2 (2)\nSET (Single Electron Transfer)\nH3W + HOOc / H3Wc+ + HOO \u2212 (3)\nH2W \u2212 + HOOc / H2Wc + HOO \u2212 (4)\nTo test the viability of any chemical process, the Gibbs free energies (DGo) for the reaction between the HOOc radical and all states were initially estimated via the FHT and SET routes. Because ionic species are unstable in the pseudo-lipid environment (corresponding to pentyl ethanoate solvent), only neutral ones acting in accordance with the FHT route (excluding SET) were investigated. Table 2 shows the computed DGo values for all reaction channels in nonpolar and polar solutions, respectively.\nIn a pentylethanoate solvent containing only the H3W form, which is explored here for the FHT mechanism, the DGo values when the HOOc captures hydrogen atoms at sites 2 and 3 are exergonic by \u22125.43 and \u22120.06 kcal mol\u22121, respectively, but it is\nonly slightly positive at site 1 (DGo \u00bc 0.63 kcal mol\u22121). In contrast, in aqueous solution, all investigated reactions for H3W and H2W \u2212 are predicted to be endergonic. The range of DGo values from \u22120.82 to \u221213.46 kcal mol\u22121 proves that the FHT route is thermodynamically favorable.\nRegarding the SET route in aqueous solution, the computed DGo values of all available states were reported to be signicantly endergonic. As can be seen in Table 2, these values were 33.61 and 5.25 kcal mol\u22121, corresponding to H3W and H2W \u2212 forms, respectively. This nding suggests that SET is an unspontaneous process. Consequently, the SET route has no effect on Wal's overall reactivity to the hydroperoxyl radical.\n3.1.3 Kinetic analyses. Although spontaneity is a crucial factor in determining chemical reactivity, it is known to be not always enough. This is because an exergonic reaction can occur at either fast or slow speeds. Consequently, studying the kinetics involved in the antioxidant action of chemical substances is essential for accurately anticipating this behavior. Not only must an effective antioxidant be capable of spontaneously reacting with free radicals, but it also needs to be quicker than the protein targets that it is designed to defend. As a result, the rate constants of the exergonic reaction channels have indeed been calculated in this article. Those with DGo greater than zero were omitted from the kinetic investigation, since they would be so easily reversible, even if they occurred at large rates, the effects on the antioxidant capacity would be insignicant.\nFig. 3 depicts the optimized geometry of the transition states of the H3W and H2W\n\u2212 forms in the studied media, and their cartesian coordinates and energies are also presented in Table S2 (ESI\u2020) and IRC plots for these transition states are also shown in Fig. S1 (ESI\u2020).\nFor the reactions in each solvent, ktotal (total rate coefficients for each reacting species) and koverall (overall rate coefficients) are calculated and displayed in Fig. 4 and 5 and Table 3. Since the neutral species is the only available reactive species, the ktotal and koverall values in lipid solution are the same (eqn (5)). The total of the rate constants was determined for each specic route. Conversely, the ktotal values for the non-charged and charged species in aqueous solution were independently determined by adding the rate coefficients via the possible paths for each of them. The molar fractions of the various existing states at the physiological pH (7.4) were taken into consideration to compute koverall in aqueous solution (eqn (6)).\nIn lipid medium:\nkoverall \u00bc ktotal \u00bc Sk(FHT-neutral) (5)\nIn aqueous solution:\nkoverall \u00bc f(neutral)$ktotal(FHT-H3W) + f(anion)$ktotal(FHT-H2W \u2212) (6)\nIn lipid solution, compound Wal (koverall \u00bc 4.84 105 M\u22121 s\u22121) reacts approximately 5 and 6 times faster than Trolox (koverall \u00bc 9.70 104 M\u22121 s\u22121, this work) and ascorbic acid (koverall \u00bc 7.80 104 M\u22121 s\u22121, this work).

Furthermore, the polarity of the solvent enhances the reactivity of the investigated compound. The predicted values for the overall rate coefficients are 7.85\n29978 | RSC Adv., 2022, 12, 29975\u201329982\n106 M\u22121 s\u22121 and 4.84 105 M\u22121 s\u22121 corresponding to water and lipid environments, respectively. It reveals that the hydroperoxyl scavenging activity of Wal increases approximately 16 times more rapidly in water solution than in lipid medium. The various existing states of this compound in aqueous solution play a role in another difference in its reactivity. The anion of Wal reacts with the HOO radical 418 times quicker than the neutral species in polar environments. Considering the various reaction sites, the quickest paths for neutral and anion forms are located in the sites 2 and 1, respectively. For a more in depth analysis of the contributions of the reaction channels to Wal's overall hydroperoxyl scavenging behavior, the branching ratios (G) were computed using eqn (7) and (8).\nIt was discovered that in lipid solution, the FHT reaction from site 2 corresponds to the most important pathway forWal, accounting for 99.15% of the total contribution, whereas the contributions from sites 1 and 3 are less signicant (0.27% and\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

The same procedures are used in molecular docking simulations to determine how compound Wal under investigation interact with the enzyme binding sites.\nThe strength of the binding interaction between the ligand and the target enzyme is characterized in terms of BAs (negative value). Fig. 6 shows the BAs of the control ligands and Wal molecule. Since the Wal ligand's positive BA value for the LO receptor is non-signicant, it is not displayed.\nThe data on how the test (Wal) and control (FLU) molecules interacted with the CP450 receptor are shown in Fig. 7A. In the CP450-Wal complex, the active area of interactions is covered by PHE 100, ILE 205, LEU 208, GLN 214, ASN 217, THR 364, PRO 367, ASN 474, PHE 476, and ALA 477 residues. Complex CP450FLU is stabilized via hydrogen bonding and non-covalent interactions with the amino acid residues GLY 98, PHE 100, ALA 103, PHE 114, LEU 366, and PRO 367.

It also interacted with ALA 209 and LEU 196 in a pialkyl way and with VAL 199 in a pi-sigma way. In a manner analogous, the amino acid residues ASN 189, VAL 199, GLN 204, GLY 207, ALA 209, and ASN 540 make up the active interaction area of the MP-Wal complex.

Therefore, compared to the drug FEB, compound Wal has a higher XO inhibitory action.\nMoreover, the binding affinity values at the CP450, MP, NO and XO receptors for Wal are lower than co-crystallized ligands (see Fig. 6), except for CP450-SWA complex, suggesting that compound Wal is more stabilized into the binding pockets of these enzymes via the formation of hydrogen bonds and noncovalent interactions.\nCompound Wal shows increased binding affinity for target enzymes inhibition mainly through hydrogen bonding interactions. From the list of residues (Fig. 7), seven interact with CP450 (GLN 214, ASN 217, THR 364, ASN 474, PHE 476, and ALA 477), four with MP (ASN 189, GLN 204, ALA 209, and ASN 540), six with NO (ASP 179, TYR 186, LYS 187, TYR 188, and PHE 245) and two with XO (ARG 880 and ALA 1079).\nAs a result of the preceding discussion, it is possible to draw the conclusion that the compound Wal demonstrates strong binding affinity toward four target receptors (MP, CP450, NO, and XO) and interacts favorably with variety of crucial amino acid residues in these enzymes, indicating that it may have potential antioxidant activity."

            "text": "A combination of the density functional theory method at M062X/6-311+G(d,p) and molecular docking simulations was efficiently used to evaluate the antiradical and antioxidant activity of the compound Wal. In both aqueous and lipid solutions, the antiradical activity of all species of Wal was investigated to determine whether or not it was caused by the SET or FHT mechanisms. It was proved that FHT is the primary reaction route for both the neutral and anion forms of Wal. The overall rate coefficient values for polar and non-polar environments are predicted to be 7.85 106 M\u22121 s\u22121 and 4.84 105 M\u22121 s\u22121, respectively. In comparison to lipid medium, the hydroperoxyl scavenging activity of Wal increases approximately 16 times more quickly in aqueous solution. According to the ndings concerning kinetic constants, the compound Wal is superior to Trolox in terms of its ability to scavenge HOOc from physiological environments (pH \u00bc 7.4). In addition, the docking results point to a parallel pathway for the antioxidant properties of Wal, which involves the inhibition of the activity of enzyme families (CP450, MP, NO and XO) that are responsible for producing ROS.\nAuthor contributions\nPhan Tu Quy: conceptualization, investigation, methodology, formal analysis.
