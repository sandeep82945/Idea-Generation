    "abstractText": "Liquid membranes based on nanoparticles follow a continuous development, both from obtaining methods and characterization of techniques points of view. Lately, osmium nanoparticles have been deposited either on flat membranes, with the aim of initiating some reaction processes, or on hollow fiber membranes, with the aim of increasing the contact surface with the phases of the membrane system. This paper presents the obtainment and characterization of a liquid membrane based on osmium nanoparticles (Os\u2013NP) dispersed in ndecanol (nDol) for the realization of a membrane system with a large contact surface between the phases, but without using a liquid membrane support. The dispersion of osmium nanoparticles in n-decanol is carried out by the method of reducing osmium tetroxide with 1\u2013undecenoic acid (UDA). The resulting membrane was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy analysis (EDAX), thermoanalysis (TG, DSC), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering (DLS). In order to increase the mass transfer surface, a design for the membrane system was realized with the dispersion of the membrane through the receiving phase and the dispersion of the source phase through the membrane (DBLM-dispersion bulk liquid membrane). The process performance was tested for the reduction of p\u2013nitrophenol (pNP) from the source phase, using sodium tetra-borohydride (NaBH4), to p\u2013aminophenol (pAP), which was transported and collected in the receiving phase. The obtained results show that membranes based on the dispersion of osmium nanoparticles in n\u2013decanol can be used with an efficiency of over 90% for the reduction of p\u2013nitrophenol and the separation of p\u2013aminophenol.",

Schematic pr sen ation of the in olv ment of the properties of n noparticles (a), and the properties needed to achieve the characteristics of embranes (b).\nong the metallic nanoparticles, those based on os ium have b en relatively little st died [14\u201316], with one of the reasons being toxicity [17]. In reality, osmium is an inert\netal ith remarkable potential mechanical, thermal, electrical and catalytic properties, and its toxicity is related to osmium tetroxide that appears on the metal surface from contact with air [18]. However, if osmium nanoparticles are embedded in a membrane material, it can benefit from the catalytic properties marked by specificity and regioselectivity [19,20], which are very difficult to obtain by other means. On the other hand, the fact that osmium has a high market value requires it to be recovered from various sources of osmium tetroxide [21]. As an industrial residue of copper metallurgy, that is also widely used on a large scale in microscopy laboratories in the field of polymers or biological materials, osmium tetroxide can become a raw material for the generation of nanoparticles used to make membranes [22]. The reduction of osmium tetroxide is most often performed with molecular hydrogen (Equation (1)), but many reducing agents, especially organic ones, can change the tetroxide metallic osmium (Equation (2)):\nOsO4 + 4 H2 \u2192 Os + 4 H2O (1)\nOsO4 + Red\u2192 Os + Ox (2)\nIn recent years, osmium nanoparticles have been deposited either on flat membranes with the aim of initiating reaction processes [14], or on hollow fiber membranes with the aim of increasing the contact surface between the phases of the membrane system [15,16]. This paper presents the obtainment and characterization of a liquid membrane based on osmium nanoparticles (Ox\u2013NP) dispersed in -decanol (nDol) for the realization of a membrane system with a large contact surface between the phases, but without using any support for the liquid membrane. The obtained membrane was morphologically and structurally characterized and the process performances in the reduction of p\u2013nitrophenol are presented (pNP)."

The resulting nanodispersion can be used in the membrane process but, if necessary, it can also be separated by nanofiltration, when osmium nanoparticles are obtained. The advantage of this preparation technique is that the obtained nanoparticles are suspended in n-decanol, with the nanodispersion itself being non-sedimentable.

Reduction and Transport Experiments\nThe study of the reduction and transport of the target chemical species (p\u2013nitrophenol and p\u2013aminophenol) was performed using an installation of our own design (Figure 3). The target chemical species were dissolved in pure water to form two stock solutions with a concentration of 10\u22123 mol/L. The source phase contains p-nitrophenol and sodium borohydride in concentrations of 10\u22124\u201310\u22122 mol/L, and the receiving phase contains a solution of hydrochloric acid with a concentration of 10\u22124\u201310\u22121 mol/L. The concentrations of the s udied chemical species and their pH were obtained using sodium borohydride, sodium hydroxide, an hydrochloric acid in the source or receiving phase. The adjustment was completed with freshly prepared sodium hydroxide solution (10\u22121 mol/L)."

The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies were recorded with a highresolution 80\u2013200 kV Titan THEMIS transmission microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Hillsboro, OR, USA) equipped with an Image Corrector and EDXS detector in the column. The microscope was operated at 200 kV in transmission mode. The HAADF (high annular dark field) i ages were obtained using STEM mode [24]. Thermal analysis, TG-DSC (thermo-gravimetric and differential scanning calorimetry), was performed with an STA 449C F3 apparatus from Netzsch (Netzsch-Ger\u00e4tebau GmbH, Selb, Germany), between 20 and 350 \u25e6C, in a dynamic (50 mL/min) N2 atmosphere. The evolved gases were analyzed with a FTIR Tensor 27 from Bruker (Bruker Co., Ettlingen, Germany), equipped with a thermostatic gas cell. The thermal analysis was run in a ni ogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 \u25e6C/min, from room temperature (RT = 25 \u25e6C) up to 900 \u25e6C [25].\nThe study conditions for each method of analysis were as follows:\n1. Dynamic light cattering (DLS) analysis: granulometry equipment: Coulter N4 Plus (He\u2013Ne laser, 632.8 nm); analysis range: 3\u20133000 nm; detection angle: 10.7\u25e6; RT analysis temperature: 23 \u25e6C \u00b11; stabilization time at RT: 5 min; analysis time: auto; data collection time: 5 min \u00d7 10 (repetitions); ultrasound time (US): 5 min (20 kHz, RT); rest time after US: ~24 h; dispersion medium (solvent): i\u2013propanol; sample dilution: ~1:500.\nMembranes 2022, 12, 1024 5 of 17\n2. Size distribution processor (SDP) analysis: ultrasound time (US): 5 min (20 kHz, RT); rest time after US: ~24 h [26].\nThe UV\u2013Vis analyses of the aqueous nitrophenol solutions were performed using a Spectrometer CamSpec M550 (Spectronic CamSpec Ltd., Leeds, UK) [27]. The UV\u2013Vis studies on the nanoparticle samples were performed with dual-beam UV equipment known as Varian Cary 50 (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, US), at a resolution of 1 nm, spectral bandwidth of 1.5 nm, and 300 nm/s scan rate. The UV\u2013 Vis spectra of the samples were recorded for wavelengths from 200 to 800 nm, at room temperature, using 10 mm quartz cells [28]. Monitoring the concentration of the chemical species in the membrane system phases was performed by ultraviolet and visible spectrometry (UV\u2013Vis) for p\u2013nitrophenol and n\u2013alcohol [29,30]. The extraction efficiency (EE %) or conversion (\u03b7%) for p\u2013nitrophenol to p\u2013aminophenol was calculated as follows [31\u201333], based on the solution concentration:\nEE(%) or \u03b7(%) =\n( c0 \u2212 c f ) c0 \u00b7100 (3)\nwith cf being the final concentration of the solute (p\u2013nitrophenol), and c0 being the initial concentration of solute (p\u2013nitrophenol). The same extraction efficiency or conversion (\u03b7%) can also be obtained based directly upon the absorbance of the considered solutions (p\u2013nitrophenol) [34\u201336], as in:\nEE(%) or \u03b7(%) = (A0 \u2212 As)\nA0 \u00b7100 (4)\nwith A0 being the initial absorbance of the sample solution, and As being the current absorbance of the sample."

            "text": "The realization of a liquid membrane based on osmium nanoparticles (Os\u2013NP) dispersed in a biodegradable solvent is an objective that would lead to the development of reaction processes (both reduction and oxidation) applicable to ecological and greening technologies. This paper presents the obtainment and characterization of a liquid membrane based on osmium nanoparticles obtained directly in n-decanol (nDol), which is the basic solvent of the liquid membrane. The osmium reduction method is well known [16] and is based on the reduction of osmium tetroxide with 1\u2013undecenoic acid (UDA). Process performances were determined using the reduction reaction of p\u2013nitrophenol (pNP), with hydrogen generated in situ using sodium borohydride (NaBH4), to p\u2013aminophenol (pAP). The choice of p\u2013nitrophenol as the target substance is justified both by the practical importance of the reaction, and by the fact that there are multiple and excellent studies that thus allow the comparative evaluation of the results [37\u201340]. Of course, the realization of an Os\u2013NP/nDol membrane can ensure the study of mild oxidation and reduction reactions for various other species of interest in environmental protection, biosynthesis and bioseparation, and is being expected to exploit the regio- and stereo-specificity of osmium [41\u201344]. The membrane system, in which nanodispersion is used to study the reduction reaction from the source phase, but also for the transport of the reaction product in the receiving phase, is designed to increase the contact surface between the phases.\nMembranes 2022, 12, 1024 6 of 17\n3.1. Morpho-Structural Characterization of the Osmium/n\u2013Decanol Nanoparticle Membrane (Os\u2013NP/nDol)\nTo characterize the osmium nanoparticles/n\u2013decanol (Os\u2013NP/nDol) nanodispersion, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermoanalysis (TG, DSC) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) were used which, through their complementarity, provide the basic characteristics [45] of the membrane material.\n3.1.1. Characterization Using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)\nThe sample was prepared by taking 100 \u00b5L of solution containing Os nanoparticles diluted in 1 mL of pure ethanol. After this, 10 \u00b5L of the suspension was put onto a 400-mesh holey carbon-coated copper grid at room temperature. The samples were analyzed using a high-resolution 80\u2013200 kV Titan THEMIS transmission microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with an Image Corrector and EDXS detector in the column. The microscope was operated at 200 kV in transmission mode. The HAADF (high annular dark field) images were obtained using the STEM mode. Through the use of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), the membrane nanodispersions were explored both before (Figure 4) and after they were used in the p\u2013nitrophenol reduction process (Figure 5). The insufficient resolution was caused by the sensitivity of osmium nanoparticles coated with n\u2013decyl alcohol and 1\u2013undecenoic acid when focusing the electronic beam, especially at high energies. This sensitivity was realized in the instant vaporization of the sample in the place we were examining (Figures 4d and 5d\u2013f light points). The most specific case is highlighted in Figure 5f, in which, in the central light created by the combustion of osmium, nanoparticles below 10 nm can be seen in the

Characterization Using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)\nThe liquid membrane samples for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were deposited with a micropipette on an aluminum support, evaporated under high vacuum, and a gold layer was deposited to protect the nanomaterial (Os\u2013NP/nDol). Although, as a precaution, the electrical and thermal protection of the material was ensured using the method of preparing the samples at high energies. The membrane material vaporized, most likely from the formation of osmium tetroxide from the nanoparticles covered with an organic layer containing oxygen (both n\u2013decyl alcohol and 1\u2013undecenoic acid). However, relevant images of the nanoparticles as aggregates were obtained (Figure 6a,b) and their size was highlighted (Figure 6c), but their intimate structure could not be explored. The coating of osmium nanoparticles with n\u2013decyl alcohol and 1\u2013undecenoic acid was confirmed by examining the surface of the sample in energy-dispersive spectroscopy analysis (EDAX) (Figure 7).\nMembranes 2022, 12, 1024 8 of 17\nMembranes\u00a02022,\u00a012,\u00a0x\u00a0 \u00a0 8\u00a0 of\u00a0 19\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\n3.1.2.\u00a0Characterization\u00a0using\u00a0Scanning\u00a0Electron\u00a0Microscopy\u00a0(SEM)\u00a0 The\u00a0liquid\u00a0membrane\u00a0samples\u00a0for\u00a0scanning\u00a0electron\u00a0microscopy\u00a0(SEM)\u00a0were\u00a0depos\u2010 ited\u00a0with\u00a0a\u00a0micropipette\u00a0on\u00a0an\u00a0aluminum\u00a0support,\u00a0evaporated\u00a0under\u00a0high\u00a0vacuum,\u00a0and\u00a0a\u00a0 gold\u00a0layer\u00a0was\u00a0deposited\u00a0to\u00a0protect\u00a0the\u00a0nanomaterial\u00a0(Os\u2013NP/nDol).\u00a0 \u00a0\nAlthough,\u00a0as\u00a0a\u00a0precaution,\u00a0the\u00a0electrical\u00a0and\u00a0thermal\u00a0protection\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0material\u00a0was\u00a0 ensured\u00a0using\u00a0the\u00a0method\u00a0of\u00a0preparing\u00a0the\u00a0samples\u00a0at\u00a0high\u00a0energies.\u00a0The\u00a0membrane\u00a0ma\u2010 terial\u00a0vaporized,\u00a0most\u00a0likely\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0formation\u00a0of\u00a0osmium\u00a0tetroxide\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0nanoparti\u2010 cles\u00a0covered\u00a0with\u00a0an\u00a0organic\u00a0layer\u00a0containing\u00a0oxygen\u00a0(both\u00a0n\u2013decyl\u00a0alcohol\u00a0and\u00a01\u2013unde\u2010 cenoic\u00a0acid).\u00a0 However,\u00a0relevant\u00a0images\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0nanoparticles\u00a0as\u00a0aggregates\u00a0were\u00a0obtained\u00a0(Figure\u00a0 6a,b)\u00a0and\u00a0their\u00a0size\u00a0was\u00a0highlighted\u00a0(Figure\u00a06c),\u00a0but\u00a0their\u00a0intimate\u00a0structure\u00a0could\u00a0not\u00a0be\u00a0 explored.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n(a)\u00a0 (b)\u00a0 (c)\u00a0\nFigure\u00a06.\u00a0Scanning\u00a0electron\u00a0microscopy\u00a0(SEM)\u00a0images\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0membrane\u00a0nanodispersion,\u00a0at\u00a0magni\u2010 tudes\u00a0of:\u00a0(a)\u00a0\u00d720,000;\u00a0(b)\u00a0\u00d750,000;\u00a0and\u00a0(c)\u00a0\u00d7100,000.\u00a0\nThe\u00a0coating\u00a0of\u00a0osmium\u00a0nanoparticles\u00a0with\u00a0n\u2013decyl\u00a0alcohol\u00a0and\u00a01\u2013undecenoic\u00a0acid\u00a0 was\u00a0confirmed\u00a0by\u00a0examining\u00a0the\u00a0surface\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0sample\u00a0in\u00a0energy\u2010dispersive\u00a0spectroscopy\u00a0 analysis\u00a0(EDAX)\u00a0(Figure\u00a07).\u00a0\n\u00a0 Figure\u00a07.\u00a0The\u00a0surface\u00a0spectrum\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0membrane\u00a0nanodispersion\u00a0sample\u00a0obtained\u00a0by\u00a0energy\u2010dis\u2010 persive\u00a0spectroscopy\u00a0analysis\u00a0(EDAX).\u00a0\nFigure 6.

Thermogravimetry and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (TG\u2013DSC) Characterization\nThermal analysis, thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry (TG\u2013DSC), were performed using the STA 449C F3 apparatus from Netzsch (Netzsch-Ger\u00e4tebau GmbH, Selb, Germany) at temperatures between 20 and 350 \u25e6C in a dynamic (50 mL/min) N2 atmosphere. The evolved gases were analyzed with an FTIR Tensor 27 from Bruker (Bruker Co., Ettlingen, Germany), equipped with a thermostatic gas cell. The studied sample (Figure 8a) started to lose the liquid part at temperatures over 100 \u25e6C, with the evaporation between 95 and 220 \u25e6C representing 94.94% of the initial mass. The process was accompanied, on a DSC curve, by an endothermic effect with a minimum at 156.8 \u25e6C and a shoulder at 194.1 \u25e6C, generated by the mix of the two liquids, n\u2013decanol and undecylenic acid.

In the present case, the catalytic effect is obtained by making contact between the variable flow rate (20\u2013120 mL/min) source phase and the membrane nanodispersion (Figure 3). Periodically, the concentration of p\u2013nitrophenol is determined spectrophotometrically, in order to compute the conversion yield. The conversion efficiency (\u03b7%) of p\u2013nitrophenol to p\u2013aminophenol is calculated either in terms of concentration (3) or using the absorbance of the samples (4) [45\u201347]. Figure 11 shows the results obtained for the conversion (\u03b7) of p\u2013nitrophenol by making contact between the source phase (1000 mL) and the membrane phase, containing either 0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 g/L osmium nanoparticles (Os\u2013NP). The source phase flow rate through the membrane nanodispersion was 100 mL/min. Although the conversion yield increased with the increase in Os\u2013NP concentration in the membrane nanodispersion, the variation of the catalytic effect was small, which suggests that the process is dependent on the contact surface.\nMembranes 2022, 12, 1024 12 of 17\nMembranes\u00a02022,\u00a012,\u00a0x\u00a0 \u00a0 13\u00a0 of\u00a0 19\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nof\u00a0the\u00a0separation\u00a0of\u00a0p\u2013aminophenol\u00a0(pAN),\u00a0formed\u00a0depending\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0membrane\u00a0flow\u00a0rate\u00a0 through\u00a0the\u00a0variable\u00a0pH\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0receiving\u00a0phase.\u00a0 3.2.1.\u00a0The\u00a0Conversion\u00a0of\u00a0p\u2013Nitrophenol\u00a0(pNP)\u00a0to\u00a0p\u2013Aminophenol\u00a0(pAN)\u00a0 The\u00a0source\u00a0phase\u00a0containing\u00a0a\u00a0p\u2010nitrophenol\u00a0substrate\u00a0with\u00a0a\u00a0concentration\u00a0of\u00a02.0\u00a0g/L\u00a0 and\u00a0 5\u00a0 g/L\u00a0 sodium\u00a0 borohydride\u00a0 (1000\u00a0mL)\u00a0 is\u00a0 passed\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 form\u00a0 of\u00a0 free\u2010falling\u00a0 drops\u00a0 through\u00a0the\u00a0stationary\u00a0nanodispersion\u00a0(500\u00a0mL).\u00a0In\u00a0the\u00a0present\u00a0case,\u00a0the\u00a0catalytic\u00a0effect\u00a0is\u00a0 obtained\u00a0by\u00a0making\u00a0contact\u00a0between\u00a0the\u00a0variable\u00a0flow\u00a0rate\u00a0(20\u2013120\u00a0mL/min)\u00a0source\u00a0phase\u00a0 and\u00a0the\u00a0membrane\u00a0nanodispersion\u00a0(Figure\u00a03).\u00a0Periodically,\u00a0the\u00a0concentration\u00a0of\u00a0p\u2013nitro\u2010 phenol\u00a0is\u00a0determined\u00a0spectrophotometrically,\u00a0in\u00a0order\u00a0to\u00a0compute\u00a0the\u00a0conversion\u00a0yield.\u00a0 The\u00a0conversion\u00a0efficiency\u00a0(\u03b7%)\u00a0of\u00a0p\u2013nitrophenol\u00a0to\u00a0p\u2013aminophenol\u00a0is\u00a0calculated\u00a0ei\u2010 ther\u00a0in\u00a0terms\u00a0of\u00a0concentration\u00a0(3)\u00a0or\u00a0using\u00a0the\u00a0absorbance\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0samples\u00a0(4)\u00a0[45\u201347].\u00a0\nFigure\u00a011\u00a0shows\u00a0the\u00a0results\u00a0obtained\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0conversion\u00a0(\u03b7)\u00a0of\u00a0p\u2013nitrophenol\u00a0by\u00a0mak\u2010 ing\u00a0contact\u00a0between\u00a0the\u00a0source\u00a0phase\u00a0(1000\u00a0mL)\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0membrane\u00a0phase,\u00a0containing\u00a0ei\u2010 ther\u00a00.5,\u00a01.0\u00a0or\u00a01.5\u00a0g/L\u00a0osmium\u00a0nanoparticles\u00a0(Os\u2013NP).\u00a0The\u00a0source\u00a0phase\u00a0flow\u00a0rate\u00a0through\u00a0 the\u00a0membrane\u00a0nanodispersion\u00a0was\u00a0100\u00a0mL/min.\u00a0Although\u00a0the\u00a0conversion\u00a0yield\u00a0increased\u00a0 with\u00a0the\u00a0increase\u00a0in\u00a0Os\u2013NP\u00a0concentration\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0membrane\u00a0nanodispersion,\u00a0the\u00a0variation\u00a0 of\u00a0the\u00a0catalytic\u00a0effect\u00a0was\u00a0small,\u00a0which\u00a0suggests\u00a0that\u00a0the\u00a0process\u00a0is\u00a0dependent\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0con\u2010 tact\u00a0surface.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFigure\u00a011.\u00a0The\u00a0variation\u00a0in\u00a0p\u2013nitrophenol\u00a0conversion\u00a0(\u03b7),\u00a0depending\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0flow\u00a0rate\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0source\u00a0\nphase\u00a0(1000\u00a0mL)\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0contact\u00a0time\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0membrane\u00a0phase\u00a0containing\u00a0either\u00a00.5,\u00a01.0\u00a0or\u00a01.5\u00a0g/L\u00a0\nosmium\u00a0nanoparticles\u00a0(Os\u2013NP).\u00a0\nTo\u00a0verify\u00a0this\u00a0hypothesis,\u00a0the\u00a0flow\u00a0rate\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0source\u00a0phase\u00a0was\u00a0varied\u00a0between\u00a020\u00a0 and\u00a0120\u00a0mL/min\u00a0(Figure\u00a012).\u00a0The\u00a0source\u00a0phase,\u00a0passing\u00a0into\u00a0droplets\u00a0through\u00a0the\u00a0mem\u2010 brane\u00a0dispersion,\u00a0has\u00a0a\u00a0contact\u00a0surface\u00a0depending\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0flow\u00a0rate\u00a0(which\u00a0influences\u00a0the\u00a0 size\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0droplets)\u00a0[46,47].\u00a0\nFigure 11.

In the first part of the contact time, an important variation in the conversion depending on the flow was observed, but after one hour of contact this variation faded. After the tests, it was established (Table 1) that the value of the apparent catalytic constant (kapp) was close to the results known from the specialized literature [14,46\u201348].\nMembranes 2022, 12, 1024 13 of 17\nThe data in Table 1 were calculated similarly to the comparison data, taking into account the most probable kinetic equation (5) [49,50]:\nln (C/C0 ) = \u2212k\u00b7K\u00b7t = \u2212kapp\u00b7t (5)\nwith C being the concentration of the reactant (mg/L), t being the reaction time, k being the reaction rate constant (mg/(L\u00d7min)), K being the adsorption coefficient of the reactant (L/mg), and kapp being the apparent catalytic rate constant when the concentration (C0) is very low. The reaction kinetics describe the pNP reduction as a reaction of a pseudo first-order reaction.\n3.2.2. Efficiency of Separation of p\u2013Aminophenol (pAN) Obtained by Reduction of p\u2013Nitrophenol (pNP)\nThe proposed reaction process aimed to eliminate p\u2013nitrophenol (pNP) from the source phase by catalytic reduction, but the actual membrane process ended with the recovery of p\u2013 aminophenol (pAN) formed by immobilization in the receiving phase (Figures 3 and 13). In the membrane transportation study, a 10 L source phase was used containing 2.0 and 5 g/L sodium borohydride, 500 mL membrane dispersion with 1.0 g/L osmium nanoparticles and 1L of acid for the receiving phase (HCl), of concentration 10\u22124\u201310\u22121 mol/L. The flow rate of the source phase was set to 100 mL/min and the membrane flow rate through the stationary receiving phase varied from 5 to 50 mL/min.\nMembranes\u00a02022,\u00a012,\u00a0x\u00a0 \u00a0 15\u00a0 of\u00a0 19\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\n3.2.2.\u00a0Efficiency\u00a0of\u00a0Separation\u00a0of\u00a0p\u2013Aminophenol\u00a0(pAN)\u00a0Obtained\u00a0by\u00a0Reduction\u00a0of\u00a0 \u00a0 p\u2013Nitrophenol\u00a0(pNP)\u00a0 \u00a0\nThe\u00a0 proposed\u00a0 reaction\u00a0process\u00a0 aimed\u00a0 to\u00a0 eliminate\u00a0 p\u2013nitrophenol\u00a0 (pNP)\u00a0 from\u00a0 the\u00a0 source\u00a0phase\u00a0by\u00a0catalytic\u00a0reduction,\u00a0but\u00a0the\u00a0actual\u00a0membrane\u00a0process\u00a0ended\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0re\u2010 covery\u00a0of\u00a0p\u2013aminophenol\u00a0(pAN)\u00a0formed\u00a0by\u00a0immobilization\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0receiving\u00a0phase\u00a0(Figures\u00a0 3\u00a0and\u00a013).\u00a0In\u00a0the\u00a0membrane\u00a0transport tion\u00a0study,\u00a0a\u00a010\u00a0L\u00a0source\u00a0phase\u00a0was\u00a0used\u00a0c ntaining\u00a0 2.0\u00a0and\u00a05\u00a0g/L\u00a0sodium\u00a0borohydride,\u00a0500\u00a0mL\u00a0membrane\u00a0dispersion\u00a0with\u00a01.0\u00a0g/L\u00a0osmium\u00a0 nanoparticles\u00a0 and\u00a0 1L\u00a0 of\u00a0 acid\u00a0 for\u00a0 the\u00a0 receiv ng\u00a0phas \u00a0 (HCl),\u00a0 of\u00a0 conc ntration\u00a0 10\u22124\u201310\u22121\u00a0 mol/L.\u00a0The\u00a0flow\u00a0rate\u00a0 f\u00a0 he\u00a0source\u00a0ph se\u00a0was\u00a0set\u00a0to\u00a0100\u00a0mL/min\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0membrane\u00a0flow\u00a0 rate\u00a0through\u00a0the\u00a0stationary\u00a0receiving\u00a0phas \u00a0varied\u00a0fr m\u00a05\u00a0to\u00a050\u00a0mL/min.\u00a0\nThe\u00a0efficiency\u00a0of\u00a0p\u2013aminophenol\u00a0transport\u00a0and\u00a0collection\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0receiving\u00a0phase\u00a0de\u2010 pended\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0membrane\u00a0nanodispersion\u00a0flow\u00a0rate\u00a0through\u00a0the\u00a0receiving\u00a0phase\u00a0(Fig re\u00a0 14a)\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0pH\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0receiving\u00a0phase\u00a0(Figure\u00a014b).\u00a0\nFigure\u00a013.\u00a0Schematic\u00a0presentation\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0reduction\u00a0process\u00a0of\u00a0p\u2013nitrophenol\u00a0(pNP)\u00a0and\u00a0transport\u00a0of\u00a0\np\u2013aminophenol\u00a0(pAN)\u00a0obtained\u00a0catalytically\u00a0on\u00a0osmium\u00a0nanoparticles\u00a0in\u00a0n\u2013decanol\u00a0(OsNP/nDol).\u00a0\nThe\u00a0increase\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0flow\u00a0rate\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0membrane\u00a0dispersion\u00a0through\u00a0the\u00a0receiving\u00a0phase\u00a0 led\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0increase\u00a0 in\u00a0the\u00a0mass\u00a0transfer\u00a0surface\u00a0and\u00a0convective\u00a0transport,\u00a0thus\u00a0having\u00a0a\u00a0 favorable\u00a0effect\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0extraction\u00a0(Figure\u00a014a).\u00a0However,\u00a0the\u00a0flow\u00a0rate\u00a0could\u00a0not\u00a0be\u00a0 in\u2010 creased\u00a0unchecked\u00a0because\u00a0 secondary\u00a0emulsification\u00a0or\u00a0 coalescence\u00a0phenomena\u00a0 could\u00a0 have\u00a0occurred\u00a0[51,52].\u00a0For\u00a0this\u00a0reason,\u00a0the\u00a0flow\u00a0rate\u00a0of\u00a040\u00a0mL/min\u00a0was\u00a0chosen\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0ex\u2010 periments\u00a0regarding\u00a0the\u00a0effect\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0receiving\u2010phase\u00a0pH.\u00a0\nMembranes 2022, 12, 1024 14 of 17\nThe efficiency of p\u2013aminophenol transport and collection in the receiving phase depended on the membrane nanodispersion flow rate through the receiving phase (Figure 14a) and the pH of the receiving phase (Figure 14b).

Extraction efficiency (EE) of p-nitrophenol (pNP) depending on: (a) the membrane flow gh the receiving phase; and (b) pH of the receiving phase.\nThe increase in the flow rate of the membrane dispersion through the receiving phase led to the increase in the mass transfer surface and convective transport, thus having a favorable effect on the extraction (Figure 14a). However, the flow rate could not be increased unchecked because secondary emulsification or coalescence phenomena could have occurred [51,52]. For this reason, the flow rate of 40 mL/min was chosen in the experiments regarding the effect of the receiving-phase pH. The value of sourc -phase (SP) pH, being c nditioned by th amount of 5 g/L sodium borohydride, was strongl alkaline during the process of transporting the p\u2013aminophenol (pAN) formed to the receiving phase (RP). To ensure a pH gr dient favorable to the extraction of p\u2013aminophenol (pAN) formed in the receiving phase, an acidic pH was required. The lower the pH value, the higher the extraction efficiency (EE) throughout the process. To streamline and optimize the process, it must be taken into account that a low pH means additional hydrochloric acid consumption, and if the pH value increases, the operating time must also increase (Figure 14b). A technically and economically acceptable pH should be set at around 2.\nMembranes 2022, 12, 1024 15 of 17"

            "text": "This paper presents the obtainment and characterization of a liquid membrane based on osmium nanoparticles obtained directly in n\u2013decanol (nDol), which is the basic solvent of the liquid membrane. The dispersion of osmium nanoparticles in n\u2013decanol was carried out by the method of reducing osmium tetroxide with 1\u2013undecenoic acid (UDA). The resulting membrane was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy analysis (EDAX), thermoanalysis (TG, DSC), Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering (DLS). In this study, the conversion of p-nitrophenol (pNP) to p\u2013aminophenol (pAN) was determined by varying the concentration of nanoparticles in the membrane nanodispersion, but also by varying the flow rate of the source phase through the membrane and the efficiency of the separation of the p\u2013aminophenol (pAN) formed, depending on the membrane flow rate through the variable-pH receiving phase. Considering the reaction kinetics describing the reduction of pNP as a pseudo-firstorder reaction, the apparent catalysis constant lies in the range 0.8 \u00d7 10\u22124\u20134.9 \u00d7 10\u22124 (mmol\u00b7s\u22121). The obtained results show that the membranes based on the dispersion of osmium nanoparticles in n-decanol can be used with an efficiency of over 90% for the reduction of p\u2013nitrophenol and the separation of p\u2013aminophenol.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, A.C.N., A.G. and P.C.A.; methodology, P.C.A., C.M., A.G., A.R.G., V.-A.G. and A.C.N.; validation, A.C.N. and A.R.G.; formal analysis, O.-C.O., C.M., B.S, .V., V.-A.G., F.M.P., S.-K.T., P.C.A., A.G. and A.C.N.; investigation, A.C.N., B.S, .V., O.-C.O., A.G., V.-A.G., S.-K.T., P.C.A., F.M.P., C.M. and A.R.G.; resources, A.C.N.; data curation, A.G. and V.-A.G.; writing\u2014 original draft preparation, A.C.N., S.-K.T., C.M., O.-C.O., B.S, .V. and A.R.G.; writing\u2014review and editing, A.C.N., V.-A.G. and P.C.A.; supervision, A.C.N.
