    "abstractText": "We investigate the thermodynamic limit of Dicke superradiance. We find an expression for the system\u2019s density matrix that we can prove is exact in the limit of large atom numbers N . This is in contrast to previously known solutions whose accuracy has only been established numerically and that are valid only for a range of times. We also introduce an asymptotically exact solution when the system is subject to additional incoherent decay of excitations as this is a common occurrence in experiments.",

INTRODUCTION\nSuperradiance was introduced by Dicke in 1954 [1]. In a simple model of all-to-all coupled emitters, he showed that during their decay process, quantum coherence is established spontaneously and leads to a superradiant burst of photons in which the maximum decay rate scales as the square of the number of atoms, max \u223c \u03b30N2/4, where \u03b30 is the decay rate of an individual atom. Superradiance can be construed as synchronization of many emitters [2], akin to the onset of lasing. Moreover, since quantum effects are typically difficult to observe in large ensembles of atoms, Dicke\u2019s observation stirred a lot of interest in the 1970s [3\u20139], as reviewed by Gross and Haroche [10]. Superradiance was observed experimentally, also in the 1970s [11\u201314]. A closely related, but different phenomenon is the Dicke phase transition [15,16], which we will not consider here.\nRecent experimental advances to produce arrays of quantum emitters in optical lattices [17\u201320] have led to a revival in interest in their radiation properties [21\u201333]. This is also motivated by technological applications of superradiance (and subradiance) as a way to improve light-matter interfaces, which play a central role in many quantum technology platforms [34\u201336]. Several experiments have probed the radiance in the linear regime [37\u201343]. Another possibility is raised by the emergence of waveguide QED [44\u201347], where quantum emitters are coupled to one-dimensional optical fields, with diverse implementations ranging from cold atoms near waveguides [48\u201352], quantum dots [53,54], or nitrogen-vacancy centers [55\u201357]. Strong confinement of light in the waveguide allows for substantial cooperativities (ratio of waveguide to free-space decay rates).

Open access publication funded by the Max Planck Society.\nthe one-dimensional nature of the light field gives rise to effectively infinite-range dissipative interactions. Moreover, if the atoms are spaced by the wavelength of their dipole transition \u03bb (the \u201catomic-mirror configuration\u201d), their dynamics is described by the original Dicke model. Superradiance has also been explored for technological applications such as low-linewidth lasers [58,59], metrology [60], or sensing [61].\nIn light of these developments, we revisit the theory of superradiance. Approximate solutions have been derived in a number of different ways [5\u201310], but ultimately they all rely on a continuum limit in which the magnetization can take noninteger values. This elegant description is, however, incorrect at short and long times. Additionally, it sensitively depends on a chosen initial distribution, and thus needs a rigorous justification. Since Dicke superradiance is a fundamental model of quantum optics, it is remarkable that no solution exact in the limit N \u2192 \u221e has been derived so far.\nThe main contribution of the present work is an explicit formula for the density matrix as a function of time, alongside a proof that it is asymptotically exact as N becomes large. In contrast to previous work, our solution works for all times. In a second contribution, motivated by experimental realities, we derive the solution in the presence of incoherent loss (for example, through decay into free space rather than guided modes) and show that it is exact as N \u2192 \u221e."

In principle, one can write an exact iterative solution [64], but it cannot be summed up in closed form to yield a formula for the magnetization for general N . Approximate solutions for Pn(t ) were derived in different ways by Degiorgio [5], Degiorgio and Ghielmetti [6], and Haake and Glauber [7]. All these solutions are equivalent and read\nP\u0304n(\u03c4 ) = N 2\nn2 exp [\u2212\u03c4 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c4 N (N \u2212 n + \u03bb)/n], (7)\nwith \u03bb = 1. Gross and Haroche later provided another derivation, but quote P\u0304 with \u03bb = 0 [10]. The choice of \u03bb has little effect and, in the following, we take \u03bb = 0. All approaches rely on the continuum limit of Eq.

From Eq. (7), Degiorgio calculated the average magnetization \u03bc(\u03c4 ) = 1/2 + \u3008Sz\u3009/N and radiance \u03c1(\u03c4 ) = \u3008S+S\u2212\u3009/N2 as functions of time,\n\u03bc(\u03c4 ) = zezH (z), \u03c1(\u03c4 ) = z(\u03c4 ) \u2212 [1 + z(\u03c4 )]\u03bc(z(\u03c4 )), (9a)\nH (z) = \u222b \u221e\nz [yey]\u22121dy, z = Ne\u2212\u03c4 , (9b)\nwhich predict the maximum average radiance max\u03c4 \u3008S+S\u2212\u3009 = 0.196N2/4 at \u03c4max = ln N + 0.330 [65]. To arrive at Eq. (7), an initial distribution was chosen by requiring that the initial radiance distribution follow a Bose-Einstein distribution [5]. Other authors arrive at the same conclusion by matching it to the corresponding Wigner distribution [7] or to predictions from the master equation [6,27]. However, the approximation\n013716-2\nthrough the continuum equation (8) is not valid at short times and its results have not rigorously been shown to be correct [66]. As a result, the distribution given by Eq. (7) is incorrect at short times. While the magnetization given by Eq. (9a) agrees well with the numerics at finite N , to our knowledge it has not rigorously been shown that it is valid in the limit N \u2192 \u221e, not even at sufficiently long times.\nThe case of \u03b3 = 0 has received considerably less attention. The competition between collective and incoherent decay has been studied in some detail [67] and a stochastic unravelling was used to efficiently simulate the system [68], but a complete theory is missing. We note that in the context of the Dicke phase transition in cavity QED, a number of works have found a nontrivial interplay between dephasing, incoherent loss, and collective coupling [69\u201371]."

Since the exact solution P\u2217 is normalized, the reverse triangle identity gives Eq. (10).\nOur second contribution is to extend our analysis to \u03b3 = 0, where we again provide a solution that is valid for all times (Theorem 2).\nIII. LARGE-N LIMIT OF PURE SUPERRADIANCE\nOur goal is to find an asymptotically exact solution Rn in the sense that the one-norm of the difference to the exact solution P\u2217 vanishes as N \u2192 \u221e, like in Eq. (11), but we require that the solution works for all times. We can prove that this is fulfilled by R given through\nRn(\u03c4 ) = {\nR<n (\u03c4 ), \u03c4 \u03c41 R>n (\u03c4 ), \u03c4 > \u03c41,\n(12)\nwhere \u03c41 = (1 + \u03b41) ln N with \u03b41 = 2/5, and\nR<n (\u03c4 ) = ( N\nn\n)2 e\u2212\u03c4 (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c4 )N (N/n\u22121), (13a)\nR>n (\u03c4 ) = N\u2211\nm=n\n( m\nn\n) e\u2212m(\u03c4\u2212\u03c41 )(e\u03c4\u2212\u03c41 \u2212 1)m\u2212nR<m (\u03c41). (13b)\nThere is a slight subtlety since the time the superradiant burst occurs depends on N , and thus it is not sufficient to prove that the solution converges at a constant time. Instead, we allow for general sequences of times that may depend on N .\nTheorem 1. Superradiant decay from all-inverted state. For any sequence of times {\u03c4n > 0 : n \u2208 N},\nlim N\u2192\u221e\n||P\u2217(\u03c4N ) \u2212 R(\u03c4N )||1 = 0. (14)\nWe only sketch the proof here; the full version can be found in Appendix A. We separately consider short times (up to \u03c40 = \u03b40 ln N , with 0 < \u03b40 < 1), intermediate times (between \u03c40 and \u03c41 = (1 + \u03b41) ln N , with 0 < \u03b41 < 1), and late times (\u03c4 > \u03c41).\nAt short times, we replace \u03b3n \u2192 \u03b3 0n = N \u2212 n + 1 in Eq. (2), which is valid since the probability distribution is expected to have support only for N \u2212 n N . The resulting equation is solved by\nQn(\u03c4 ) = e\u2212\u03c4 (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c4 )N\u2212n, Qn(0) = \u03b4n,N . (15) Using this solution, we show that the error due to the substitution \u03b3n \u2192 \u03b3 0n vanishes as N \u2192 \u221e as long as we only consider times up to \u03c40 = \u03b40 ln N with 0 < \u03b40 < 1. We then use Q(\u03c40) as the initial condition for Eq. (8) and thus obtain a solution up to \u03c41. Since Qn(\u03c40) is sufficiently smooth in n, we can show that the error incurred by using the continuum approximation vanishes as N \u2192 \u221e. A further approximation of the result yields R< [Eq. (13a)]. For late times, we again linearize the equations of motion, \u03b3n \u2192 \u03b3 1n = n, which is valid as the probability distribution is expected to concentrate around n \u2248 0. This yields the solution R> in Eq. (13b). We can bound the error to show that ||R> \u2212 P\u2217||1 \u2192 0.\nA few comments are in order about the solution we provide. First, for any finite N , R neither exactly fulfills the equation of motion given by Eq. (2), nor the continuum equation given by Eq. (8), and its derivative is discontinuous at \u03c41, although R itself is continuous. Nevertheless, R describes the correct distribution at all times. Second, as part of our proof, we show that ||P\u2217(\u03c4 ) \u2212 P\u0304(\u03c4 )||1 \u2192 0 as N \u2192 \u221e, which proves that the solution found in the literature also converges to the right solution, but only for intermediate times. Third, a remaining question is whether the magnetization and radiance (9a) are accurate, since they are calculated by integrating the continuum distribution rather than summing the (true) discrete distribution. With the following corollary, we show that both formulas are nevertheless asymptotically exact for all times.\nCorollary 1. Magnetization and radiance. The magnetization and radiance (9a) predicted in the continuum limit are asymptotically correct for any sequence of times {\u03c4n > 0 : n \u2208 N},\nlim N\u2192\u221e\n\u03bcexact (\u03c4N ) \u2212 \u03bc(\u03c4N ) \u2192 0, (16a)\nlim N\u2192\u221e\n\u03c1exact (\u03c4N ) \u2212 \u03c1(\u03c4N ) \u2192 0. (16b)\nOne might wonder whether a universal form for the magnetization and radiance can be found that is independent of N and thus holds in the large-N limit. We can obtain such a form by using the continuum limit of Eq. (7). Performing a change of\n013716-3\nvariables to T = e\u03c4 /N , we obtain\np(x, T ) = 1 N 1 T x2 exp\n( 1 \u2212 1/x\nT\n) . (17)\nApart from the normalization 1/N , this expression is independent of N . The corresponding magnetization \u03bc = 1/2 + \u3008Sz\u3009/N and radiance \u03c1 = \u3008S+S\u2212\u3009/N2 [plotted in Fig. 1(a)] read\n\u03bc(T ) = e 1/T T H (1/T ), \u03c1(T ) = 1 T \u2212 e 1/T T 2 (1 + T )H (1/T ). (18) Note that Eqs. (17) and (18) are identical to Eqs. (7) and (9a) up to the change of variables, but we find it more convenient to analyze the behavior at N \u2192 \u221e in this form as they are independent of atom number N , having absorbed all dependence on N into T . Note that the time variable T (t ) = exp(Nt )/N starts at T (0) = 1/N and exponentially quickly moves to infinity. The superradiant pulse occurs close to T = 1 and, as is evident from Eq. (18), its height scales with N2. We can determine the maximum radiance numerically and find it is \u03c1 \u2248 0.196 at T \u2248 1.39, at which point \u03bc \u2248 0.532. In normal units, the time of maximum radiance is tpulse = ln(N )/N + 0.330/N . At t = 0, we have T = 1/N , at which point \u03bc(1/N ) \u2248 1 \u2212 1/N . Thus, the starting point of the dynamics corresponds to the time at which, on average, one photon has decayed. Another result from the above analysis is that in the original time t , the magnetization tends to a step function \u03bc(t ) \u2192 [ln(N )/N \u2212 tpulse]."

We answer this question in two parts. First, we derive the exact solution as N \u2192 \u221e, which shows that in the largeN limit, superradiance always persists (Sec. IV A). Second, the question then arises whether there is a critical emitter number that is needed to observe superradiance.

While correct, this description misses the fact that some excitations are transferred into states that do not decay collectively. The population of such dark (or subradiant) excitations grows linearly at a rate \u03b3 until the superradiant burst, such that an average of \u03b3 ln N dark excitations are produced. Since they can only decay incoherently, they dominate the late time behavior with a slow decay at a rate \u03b3 /N .\nThe result that magnetization and radiance behave as in pure superradiance does not necessarily apply to finite N and,\n013716-4\nin fact, there is a threshold N below which superradiance disappears. One necessary requirement for superradiance is that the maximum radiance occurs at t > 0.

Since the incoherent loss occurs at a rate equal to \u03b3 times the number of excitations in the system, we integrate the solution given by Eq.

Note that Sec. III also applies to Eq. (24) as it is just the integral over \u03bc(\u03c4 ). The leading-order behavior Nloss = \u03b3 ln N , valid when ln N 1 Nloss/N , can be obtained from the simple observation that the superradiant burst occurs at t ln N/N and that the emitters are mostly excited before and mostly in the ground state after. The fact that Nloss \u2248 \u03b3 ln N implies that as N \u2192 \u221e, the fraction of atoms that decay incoherently is vanishingly small. This is ultimately the reason why in the large-N limit, the predictions from pure superradiance for magnetization and radiance also hold in the presence of incoherent loss."

There are a number of other experimentally relevant effects that should be considered in future work, some of which may fundamentally change the behavior at large N . Typical effects include disorder in the decay rates of atoms into the collective mode, inhomogeneous broadening, finite temperature, and, specifically in the case of waveguide QED, spatial disorder. All of these distinguish the atoms and therefore make a straightforward extension of the theory presented here difficult. While inhomogeneous broadening becomes negligible at large N , it is not clear at present how the other contributions would affect our solution."

In the limit N \u2192 \u221e, the geometric series gives e\u2212\u03c4 /(1 \u2212 a), which establishes the result.\nWe frequently need to bound sums over P\u0304 for times in the range \u03c4 \u2208 [\u03c40, \u03c41], \u03c41 = (1 + \u03b41) ln N , for which we use the following definition.\nDefinition 5.\nGa,b,c = N max \u03c4\u2208[\u03c40,\u03c41] max n P\u0304n(\u03c4 )n \u2212aNbe\u2212c\u03c4 .

Then,\n2 = N \u03c4\u0304\u2211 s=0 e\u2212\u03c4 (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c4 )s \u2223\u2223\u2223\u22231 \u2212 N2(N \u2212 s)2 (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c4 ) s 2 N\u2212s \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 =\nN \u03c4\u0304\u2211 s=0 e\u2212\u03c4 (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c4 )s \u2223\u2223\u2223\u22231 \u2212 [1 + O(s/N )]\n\u00d7 [ 1 + O ( s2\nN \u2212 s e \u2212\u03c4 )]\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 = O [ max\ns\u2208[0,N \u03c4\u0303 ]\n( s\nN + s\n2\nN \u2212 s e \u2212\u03c4\n)] , (A27)\nwhere in the last line we used that the sum over e\u2212\u03c4 (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c4 )s is bounded 1. For shorter times, we can arbitrarily restrict the sum to s < N0.1 and the bound still works. Thus, 2 \u2192 0 for all \u03c4 < (1 \u2212 \u03b5) ln N for any constant \u03b5 > 0.\nLemma 6. Equivalence of R and P\u0304. If \u03c4 > \u03c40, then\n3(\u03c4 ) = ||R(\u03c4 ) \u2212 P\u0304(\u03c4 )|| \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 N\u2192\u221e 0. (A28)\nProof. Bounding the residue from Taylor\u2019s theorem, we have exp(\u2212e\u2212\u03c4 ) = 1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c4 + \u03b81, with |\u03b81| < e\u22122\u03c4 , such that\n3(\u03c4 ) = N\u2211\nn=0 P\u0304n(\u03c4 )|(1 + \u03b81e\u2212\u03c4 )N (N/n\u22121) \u2212 1|\n< N\u2211 n=0 P\u0304n(\u03c4 )O[\u03b81e\u2212\u03c4 N (N/n \u2212 1)]. (A29)\nWe distinguish three cases: (i) If \u03c4 > (1 + \u03b5) ln N for any \u03b5 > 0, then N2e\u22122\u03c4 \u2192 0 and this expression vanishes. (ii) If (1 \u2212 \u03b5) ln N < \u03c4 < (1 + \u03b5) ln, we can use Lemma 3 to bound Eq. (A29) by N2\u22123(1\u2212\u03b5), which vanishes. (iii) If \u03c4 < (1 \u2212 \u03b5) ln N , we split the sum into two parts: one up to N \u2212 N\u03bc and the other from N \u2212 N\u03bc to N (for some 0 < \u03bc < 1). For the first part, we have\nN\u2212N\u03bc\u2211 n=0 |Rn \u2212 P\u0304n| < N3 max n N\u03bc e\u22122\u03c4 \u03b1n exp (\u2212\u03b1n)\n< N3\u22122\u03b40 N\u03bc\u2212\u03b40 exp(\u2212N\u03bc\u2212\u03b40 ), (A30) where, in the first line, we introduced \u03b1n = e\u2212\u03c4 N (N/n \u2212 1) and, to go to the second line, we first used that the maximum with \u03b1 of \u03b1e\u2212\u03b1 is at \u03b1 = 1, but that \u03b1 N\u03bc\u2212\u03b40 to replace \u03b1 = N\u03bc\u2212\u03b40 , where we also used that e\u2212\u03c4 N\u2212\u03b40 . Equation (A30)\n013716-7\nvanishes for \u03bc > \u03b40. For the second part, we have\nN\u03bc\u2211 s=0 (RN\u2212s \u2212 P\u0304N\u2212s) < N2\u03bc\u22123\u03b40 , (A31)\nwhich can be made to vanish, too, by taking \u03bc < 3\u03b40/2 [consistent with Eq. (A4)].\nLemma 7. P\u0304 is asymptotically correct. For times \u03c40 < \u03c4 < \u03c41, P\u0304 converges to P\u2217,\n4(\u03c4 ) = ||P\u2217(\u03c4 ) \u2212 P\u0304(\u03c4 )|| \u2192 0. (A32) Proof. We establish 4 \u2192 0 by bounding the difference between the continuum solution (Definition 3) and the discrete exact solution (Definition 1). The exact discrete solution fulfills Eq. (2), whereas the continuum solution obeys\n\u2202\u03c4 P\u0304n(\u03c4 ) = \u2202n{[n(N \u2212 n)/N]P\u0304n(\u03c4 )}. (8, restated) We replace the differential by a first-order finite difference with error U ,\n\u2202n(\u03b3nP\u0304n(\u03c4 )) = \u03b3n+1P\u0304n+1(\u03c4 ) \u2212 \u03b3nP\u0304n(\u03c4 ) + Un(\u03c4 ). (A33) By the remainder theorem applied to the variable n, the residue is bounded by\n|Un(\u03c4 )| < max n m n+1 ( |H2(m, \u03c4 )| 2 ) , (A34)\nwhere\nH2(m, \u03c4 ) = \u22022m(\u03b3mP\u0304m(\u03c4 )). (A35) We now bound the error E = P\u2217 \u2212 P\u0304. It is governed by \u2202\u03c4En(\u03c4 ) = \u2212\u03b3nP\u2217n (\u03c4 ) + \u03b3n+1P\u2217n+1(\u03c4 ) \u2212 \u2202n{[\u03b3n \u2212 n/N]P\u0304n(\u03c4 )}\n= \u2212\u03b3nEn(\u03c4 ) + \u03b3n+1En+1(\u03c4 ) + Un(\u03c4 ) + \u2202n[nP\u0304n(\u03c4 )]/N = \u2212\u03b3nEn(\u03c4 ) + \u03b3n+1En+1(\u03c4 ) + E inn (\u03c4 ). (A36)\nNote that in the last line, we defined\nE inn (\u03c4 ) = Un(\u03c4 ) + P\u0304n(\u03c4 )/N + n\u2202nP\u0304n(\u03c4 )/N, (A37) with E in0 (\u03c4 ) = U0(\u03c4 ) = \u03b31P\u03041(\u03c4 ). This yields a bound on E ,\n|| E (\u03c4 )|| \u222b \u03c4\n\u03c40\nd\u03c4 \u2032||e (\u03c4\u2212\u03c4 \u2032 ) Ein(\u03c4 \u2032)|| \u222b \u03c4\n\u03c40\nd\u03c4 \u2032|| Ein(\u03c4 \u2032)||\n< (\u03c41 \u2212 \u03c40) max \u03c40 \u03c4 \u03c41 || Ein(\u03c4 )||. (A38)\nWe bound the terms in E in individually. The contribution due to the Taylor residue is\nmax \u03c40 \u03c4 \u03c41 ||U (\u03c4 )|| max \u03c4 \u2211 n max n m n+1 ( |H2(m, \u03c4 )| 2 )\n< N max \u03c4 max n |H2(n, \u03c4 )| 2 . (A39)\nConsidering first the U0 = P\u03041(\u03c4 ) term, we have P\u03041(\u03c4 ) = N2e\u2212\u03c4 (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c4 )N (N\u22121) \u2192 0 if \u03c4 < 2 ln N, (A40)\nso we can take n 1 in the following.\nTo bound H2, we first note\nH2(n, \u03c4 ) = P\u0304n(\u03c4 ) 2\n[ 2 + 2N\nn + N 3(N \u2212 n + 1) n3e2\u03c4\n+ 2N (n \u2212 2 \u2212 2N ) e\u03c4 n2\n] . (A41)\nTaking the maximum over n and \u03c4 lets us bound the corresponding contribution to Ein in terms of G (see Definition 5),\nmax \u03c4 ||U || < max \u03c4 (G1,0,0 + G3,4,2 + G2,3,1 + G1,1,1 + G2,2,1). (A42) Using Lemma 3, we find that these terms all vanish as long as \u03b41 < 1/2 and \u03b40 > 2/3 [consistent with Eq. (A4)].\nWe also have to consider the second part of Ein that stems from the error introduced in the rate equation. In terms of G, we have\n\u222b \u03c41 \u03c40 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2202n [ n N P\u0304n(\u03c4 ) ]\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n< ln(N )(G0,\u22121,0 + G1,0,0 + G2,2,1) \u2192 0, (A43)\nagain using Lemma 3. Thus, all terms in Ein vanish, which implies that || E || \u2192 0 as N \u2192 \u221e.\nLemma 8. R> is asymptotically correct. For times \u03c4 > \u03c41, R> converges to P\u2217,\n5(\u03c4 ) = ||P\u2217(\u03c4 ) \u2212 R>(\u03c4 )|| \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 N\u2192\u221e 0. (A44)\nProof. From Lemmas 6 and 7, we know that R<n (\u03c41) is a good approximation with the error vanishing, where \u03c41 = (1 + \u03b41) ln N . Applying now the linearized equations of motion, we obtain the solution [same as Eq. (13b)]\nR>(\u03c4 ) = e S (\u03c4\u2212\u03c41 )R<(\u03c41), (A45)\nwhere S is the same matrix as but with the replacement \u03b3n \u2192 \u03b3 Sn = n. The difference between those two matrices, 1 = S \u2212 , has rates \u03b3 1n = n(n \u2212 1)/N . In terms of 1, we have\ne (\u03c4\u2212\u03c41 )R<(\u03c41) = e S (\u03c4\u2212\u03c41 )R<(\u03c41) \u2212 \u222b \u03c4 \u03c41 d\u03c4 \u2032e (\u03c4\u2212\u03c4 \u2032 ) 1e S\u03c4 \u2032 R<(\u03c41). (A46)\nUsing (A45) and the definition, we have\n5(\u03c4 ) \u222b \u03c4\n\u03c41\nd\u03c4 \u2032||e (\u03c4\u2212\u03c4 \u2032 ) 1R>(\u03c4 \u2032)|| = \u222b \u03c4\n\u03c41 d\u03c4 \u2032|| 1R>(\u03c4 \u2032)|| (A47)\nsince exp( \u03c4 ) is a stochastic matrix, and thus it does not change the norm.\n013716-8\nTo bound the integral, we first evaluate the argument\n|| 1R>(\u03c4 )|| = N\u22121\u2211 n=0 n N |(n + 1)R>n+1(\u03c4 ) \u2212 (n \u2212 1)R>n (\u03c4 )| + (N \u2212 1)R>N (\u03c4 )\n= N\u22121\u2211 n=0 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 nN N\u22121\u2211 m=n ( m n ) (e\u03c4\u2212\u03c41 \u2212 1)m\u2212ne\u2212m(\u03c4\u2212\u03c41 )[(m + 1)R<m+1(\u03c41) \u2212 (n \u2212 1)R<m (\u03c41)] \u2212 gn \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 + N\u2212\u03b41 e\u2212N (\u03c4\u2212\u03c41 ), (A48) where\ngn = ( N\nn\n) n\nN (n \u2212 1)e\u2212N (\u03c4\u2212\u03c41 )(e\u03c4\u2212\u03c41 \u2212 1)N\u2212nRN (\u03c41). (A49)\nFirst, we notice that the term in square brackets in Eq. (A48) is always positive, as we can bound it from below by\n(m + 1)R<m+1(\u03c41) \u2212 (n \u2212 1)R<m (\u03c41) 2Rm+1(\u03c41) + (n \u2212 1)[Rm+1(\u03c41) \u2212 Rm(\u03c41)]\n= Rm+1(\u03c41) { 2 + (n \u2212 1) [ 1 \u2212 (\n1 + 1 m\n)2 exp ( \u2212 N 2e\u2212\u03c41 m(m + 1) )]}\nRm+1(\u03c41) { 2 + (n \u2212 1) [ 1 \u2212 (\n1 + 1 n\n)2]} = Rm+1(\u03c41)(1/n + 1/n2) > 0. (A50)\nSecond, we find K = \u2211\nn\ngn = (N \u2212 1)e\u03c41\u22122\u03c4 < N\u2212\u03b41 . (A51)\nThus we can drop the absolute value signs from Eq. (A48) (since the difference in square brackets is positive) while incurring an error of, at most, 2K . The sum over n then reduces to the boundary term N (N \u2212 1)R>N (\u03c4 ). Thus, we have\n|| 1R>(\u03c4 )|| (N \u2212 1)R>N (\u03c4 ) + 2K + N\u2212\u03b41 e\u2212N (\u03c4\u2212\u03c41 ). (A52)\nThe integral\u222b \u03c4 \u03c41 d\u03c4 \u2032|| 1R>(\u03c4 \u2032)|| N \u2212 1 N e\u2212\u03c41 (1 \u2212 e\u2212N (\u03c4\u2212\u03c41 ) )\n+ N \u2212 1 2 (e\u2212\u03c41 \u2212 e\u03c41\u22122\u03c4 ) + N\u22121\u2212\u03b41 (1 \u2212 e\u2212N (\u03c4\u2212\u03c41 ) ) < N\u2212\u03b41 (A53)\nvanishes as N \u2192 \u221e for any \u03c4 > \u03c41. Finally, we prove the corollary that states that the formulas for magnetization and radiance are correct. Corollary 1. Magnetization and radiance (restated). The predicted magnetization and radiance (9a) are asymptotically correct for any sequence of times {\u03c4n > 0 : n \u2208 N},\nlim N\u2192\u221e\n\u03bcexact (\u03c4N ) \u2212 \u03bc(\u03c4N ) \u2192 0, (A54a)\nlim N\u2192\u221e\n\u03c1exact (\u03c4N ) \u2212 \u03c1(\u03c4N ) \u2192 0. (A54b)\nProof. At early times (\u03c4 < \u03c40), we can evaluate the magnetization explicitly using the distribution Q (Lemma 4), N\u2211 s=0\n(N \u2212 s)e\u2212\u03c4 (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c4 )s = N \u2212 e\u03c4 + 1 \u2212 O[(1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c4 )N\u22121]. (A55) Expanding H (z) around z = \u221e, we find H (z) = e\u2212z(z\u22121 \u2212 z\u22122 + 2z\u22123 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ). Therefore, Eq. (9a) becomes \u03bc(\u03c4 ) = 1 \u2212\ne\u03c4 /N + e2\u03c4 /N2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . Thus, the error in the magnetization is O(1/N, e2\u03c4 /N2). Clearly, the same is true for the radiance.\nFor intermediate times, we bound the difference between the integral and the sum, E (mag) = \u222b N0 dn nP\u0304n(\u03c4 ) \u2212\u2211N\nn=0 nP\u0304n(\u03c4 ). Using Taylor\u2019s theorem to bound the residue of the zeroth-order expansion, we obtain\n|E (mag)| N\n\u2211\nn\nP\u0304n(\u03c4 )\n( 1\nN + e \u2212\u03c4 N n2\n) . (A56)\nThis vanishes by Lemma 3. The same steps for the radiance yield the same error bound, but with an additional contribution\u2211\nn(N/n)e \u2212\u03c4 P\u0304n, which also vanishes by Lemma 3.\nFinally, to cover late times, we prove that at time \u03c41, both the exact magnetization and \u03bc (9a) vanish as N \u2192 \u221e. Specifically, we show that the probability mass of the solution for n > N\u03bc for \u03bc < 1 \u2212 \u03b41 vanishes, even after multiplying it by Nk with k constant,\nN\u2211 n=N\u03bc NkP\u0304n(\u03c41) < N\u2211 n=N\u03bc N1+k exp(\u2212N1\u2212\u03b41\u2212\u03bc) \u2192 0. (A57)\nTheorem 1. Superradiant decay from all-inverted state (re-\nstated). For any sequence of times {\u03c4n > 0 : n \u2208 N}, lim\nN\u2192\u221e ||P\u2217(\u03c4N ) \u2212 R(\u03c4N )||1 = 0. (14, restated)\nProof. Together with the triangle inequality, Lemmas 4 and 5 establish Eq. (14) for times \u03c4N < ln N . Similarly, Lemmas 6 and 7 together show that Eq. (14) holds between \u03c40 and \u03c41, and Lemma 8 proves that Eq. (14) is true for \u03c4N \u03c41."

The distribution in r, corresponding to the total spin j = N/2 \u2212 r, is given by the Poisson distribution\nFr (\u03c4 ) = e\u2212\u03b3 \u03c4 (\u03b3 \u03c4 ) r\nr! . (21, restated)\nWe will frequently need to use that \u3008r\u3009/N vanishes, for which we use the following result.\nLemma 9. Vanishing probability mass 2. In the limit N \u2192 \u221e, the probability mass of the distribution F (\u03c4 ) vanishes faster than any polynomial of N in the interval from r = N\u03b5 to N for any \u03b5 > 0 and \u03c4 = O(N\u03b4 ) if \u03b4 < \u03b5. Specifically,\nlim N\u2192\u221e N\u2211 r=N\u03b5 NkFr (\u03c4 ) = 0. (B3)\nProof. Using Eq. (21), we have\nlim N\u2192\u221e N\u2211 r=N\u03b5 NkFr (\u03c4 ) < N k+1N (\u03b4\u2212\u03b5)N \u03b5 \u2192 0.\nAt early times (before \u03c40), we linearize the rates around s = N \u2212 2r \u2212 n \u2248 0, which yields (1),linn,r = N \u2212 2r \u2212 n + 1 + \u03b3 , (B4a)\n(2),linn,r = N \u2212 2r \u2212 n + 1, (B4b) (3),linn,r = \u03b3 , (B4c) (4),linn,r = 0. (B4d)\nDefinition 9. Early solution with loss Q. We define Qn,r by\nQn,r (\u03c4 ) = e\u2212\u03c4 (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c4 )N\u22122r\u2212ne\u2212\u03b3 \u03c4 (\u03b3 \u03c4 ) r\nr! = Qn+2r (\u03c4 )Fr (\u03c4 ),\n(B5) with Qn and Fr defined in Definitions 2 and 8. Qn,r obeys Eq. (5) with rates in Eq. (B4) and can thus equivalently be written as\nQ(\u03c4 ) = e 0\u03c4P\u2217(0), (B6) where 0 is the same matrix as in Definition 6, but with linearized rates given by Eq. (B4).\nWe solve for the dynamics after the initial phase by moving to a continuum limit in x = n/N , while retaining r as a discrete variable. Specifically, we solve\n\u2202\u03c4 pn,r (\u03c4 ) \u2212 \u2202n [\nn(N \u2212 n) N pn,r (\u03c4 )\n]\n= \u03b3 n2N2 [pn,r\u22121(\u03c4 ) \u2212 pn,r (\u03c4 )]. (B7) Lemma 10. Continuum solution with loss. Equation (B7), with the initial data at time \u03c4 = \u03c40 being P\u0304n+2r (\u03c40)Fr (\u03c40), is solved by\nPcontn,r (\u03c4 ) = P\u0304n+2r (\u03c4 )Fr (T\u0303n(\u03c4 )), (B8) where\nT\u0303n(\u03c4 ) = \u03c4 + { n\nN \u2212 n n + e\u03c40\u2212\u03c4 (N \u2212 n)\n+ ln [ n\nN + e\u03c40\u2212\u03c4\n( 1 \u2212 n\nN\n)]} . (B9)\nProof. Proof is by substitution. In Theorem 2, we take \u03c40 \u2192 0 in Eq. (B9) to obtain Eq. (22). The main reason to do so is for simplicity. As we prove below, it does not affect the solution. Intuitively, the continuum solution given by Eq. (B8) can be understood by going back to Eq. (B7) and realizing that the left-hand side is the same as Eq. (8). We can think of it as the homogeneous part of the differential equation, which is solved by P\u0304. The right-hand side only acts on the distribution in r and therefore does not change the distribution in n. Since the right-hand side increases r at a rate depending on \u03b3 n2/N2, the distribution in r is a Poisson distribution (Definition 8), but with a time that depends on the dynamics of n, which can in turn be related to the characteristics of the left-hand side of Eq. (B7).\nAt late times, we linearize around n = 0 to obtain the rates (1),laten,r = n + \u03b3 r/N, (B10a) (2),laten,r = n, (B10b) (3),laten,r = 0, (B10c) (4),laten,r = \u03b3 r/N. (B10d)\nTo extend the solution to all times, we need to keep small contributions of the order of r/N in (4), as they are responsible\n013716-10\nfor the decay of dark excitations at late times. The rates predict that the remaining collective and dark excitations decay independently, but their rates have different orders in N . In the large-N limit, we thus expect first a rapid decay to n = 0, and subsequently a slow decay of the dark excitations, which can only decay incoherently, as they are dark with respect to the collective decay.\nDefinition 10. Late solution with loss. We define the late distribution\nR>n,r (\u03c4 ) = N/2\u2211 r\u2032=r\n( r\u2032\nr\n) e\u2212\u03b3 r \u2032(\u03c4\u2212\u03c41 )/N (e\u03b3 (\u03c4\u2212\u03c41 )/N \u2212 1)r\u2032\u2212r\n\u00d7 N\u22122r\u2032\u2211 n\u2032=n\n( n\u2032\nn\n) e\u2212n\n\u2032(\u03c4\u2212\u03c41 )(e\u03c4\u2212\u03c41 \u2212 1)n\u2032\u2212nRn\u2032r\u2032 (\u03c41). (B11)\nIt obeys R>(\u03c41) = R<(\u03c41) and obeys the equations of motion given by Eq. (5) with linearized rates given by Eq. (B10)."

One small difference is that for times shorter than \u03c41, we bound the difference to the approximate solution P\u0303 instead of the exact solution P\u2217, as it is simpler. Lemma 15 shows that this is justified because the difference between the approximate and exact solutions also vanishes for times that grow only logarithmically.\nTheorem 2. Superradiance with incoherent loss (restated). The difference between the exact solution \u03c1(\u03c4 ) to Eq. (1), subject to the initial condition \u03c1(0) = |N\u3009\u3008N |, and \u03c3 (N )(\u03c4 ) = Rn,r (\u03c4 )Pn,r obeys, for any sequence of times {\u03c4n > 0 : n \u2208 N},\nlim N\u2192\u221e\n||\u03c3 (N )(\u03c4N ) \u2212 \u03c1(\u03c4N )||1 \u2192 0, \u2200\u03c4 0. (23, restated)\nProof. Applying the triangle inequality twice, Lemmas 11, 13, and 15 together establish Eq. (23) for times \u03c4N < ln N . Similarly, Lemmas 12, 14, and 15 show that Eq. (23) holds between \u03c40 and \u03c41, and Lemma 16 proves that Eq. (23) is true for \u03c4N \u03c41.\nLemma 11. Q is correct. For any sequence of times {\u03c4N < ln N : N \u2208 N}, Q(\u03c4N ) converges to the approximate solution P\u0303 (\u03c4 ),\n1(\u03c4 ) = ||Q(\u03c4 ) \u2212 P\u0303 (\u03c4 )||1 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 N\u2192\u221e 0. (B12)\nProof. As in Lemma 4, we define the difference between the matrices that generate the evolution 1 = 0 \u2212 \u0303, with 0 defined in Definition 9 and \u0303 defined in Definition 7. This allows us to bound 1 as Eq.

(B14c) We split the bound into a part independent of \u03b3 and one part proportional to \u03b3 , which we will treat separately. The independent part is\n(wg) 1 =\nln N\nN \u2211 n,r |(N \u2212 2r \u2212 n + 1)(N \u2212 n)Qn(\u03c4 )\n\u2212 (N \u2212 2r \u2212 n)(N \u2212 n \u2212 1)Qn+1(\u03c4 )|Fr (\u03c4 ). (B15)\nDue to Lemma 9, we can neglect the contribution from r, such that Eq. (B15) reduces to Eq. (A19) and thus vanishes. The part proportional to \u03b3 reads\n(free) 1 = \u03b3 ln N \u2211 n,r N \u2212 n N\n\u00d7 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2212 Qn,r \u2212 nN Qn+1,r + ( 1 \u2212 n N ) Qn+2,r\u22121 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223. (B16)\nNote that the rates inside the absolute value sign are all equal to or smaller than 1. Using Lemma 1, we can restrict the sum over to values between N \u2212 2r and N \u2212 2r \u2212 N\u03bc, which allows us to bound N \u2212 n by N\u03bc (recall that r is, at most, ln N by Lemma 9). Since Q is normalized, we find (free)1 < \u03b3 (ln N )2N\u03bc\u22121, which vanishes as N \u2192 \u221e.\nLemma 12. Equivalence of R and Pcont. For \u03c40 < \u03c4 < \u03c41, R< [Eq. (20a)] converges to Pcont (Lemma 10),\n3(\u03c4 ) = ||R(\u03c4 ) \u2212 Pcont (\u03c4 )|| \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 N\u2192\u221e 0. (B17)\nProof. 3(\u03c4 ) = \u2211 n,r |[Rn+2r (\u03c4 ) \u2212 P\u0304n+2r (\u03c4 )]Fr (Tn(\u03c4 ))\n\u2212 P\u0304n+2r (\u03c4 )[Fr (Tn(\u03c4 )) \u2212 Fr (T\u0303n(\u03c4 ))]|. (B18) The difference in the first line vanishes by Lemmas 6 and 9. The second line is only nonzero for \u03c4 < \u03c40 = \u03b40 ln N , where \u03b40 < 1 as per Eq. (A4). For those times, we can restrict the sum over n to values between N \u2212 N\u03bc and N (Lemma 1). Defining s = N \u2212 n and using s < N\u03bc, we have\nTn(\u03c4 ) = \u03c4 + 1 \u2212 s N \u2212 1 \u2212 s/N 1 \u2212 s(1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c4 )/N\n+ ln [\n1\u2212 s N\n(1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c4 ) ] = \u03c4+\u03b4\u03c4n, |\u03b4\u03c4n| < N\u03bc\u22121.\n(B19)\nThus, \u2211 n,r P\u0304n+2r (\u03c4 )[Fr (Tn(\u03c4 )) \u2212 Fr (T\u0303n(\u03c4 ))]|\n< \u2211\nr N\u03bc\u2211 s=0 P\u0304N\u2212s(\u03c4 )|Fr (\u03c4 ) \u2212 Fr (\u03c4 + N\u03bc\u22121)|\n\u2211\nr N\u03bc\u2211 s=0 PcontN\u2212s,r (\u03c4 ) rN\u03bc\u22121 \u03c4 \u2192 0. (B20)\n013716-11\nThis bound does not work for a sequence of times {\u03c4n > 0 : n \u2208 N}, in which the \u03c4N decay as N\u03bc\u22121 or faster. However, in this case, we have Fr 1(\u03c4N ) < Nr(\u03bc\u22121), which means we can replace Fr by \u03b4r,0, in which case we can use Lemma 6.\nLemma 13. R converges to Q at short times. For any \u03c4 < ln N , R(\u03c4 ) [Eq. (20a)] converges to Q(\u03c4 ) (Definition 9),\n2(\u03c4 ) = ||Q(\u03c4 ) \u2212 R(\u03c4 )||1 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 N\u2192\u221e 0. (B21)\nProof. We use Lemma 5 to replace Qn by Rn, and Lemmas 1 and 9 to restrict the range of the sum. Using the same reasoning as in Eq.

Pcont is asymptotically correct. For times \u03c40 < \u03c4 < \u03c41, Pcont [Eq. (20a)] converges to P\u0303 (Definition 7),\n4(\u03c4 ) = ||P\u0303 (\u03c4 ) \u2212 Pcont (\u03c4 )|| \u2192 0. (B23) Proof. We start by defining the error\nEn,r = P\u0303n,r (\u03c4 ) \u2212 Pcontn,r (\u03c4 ), (B24) where Pcont solves the continuum equation and has been defined in Lemma 10. We know that the norm ||E || vanishes at \u03c40 as N \u2192 \u221e, as per Lemmas 12 and 13. To bound it for the entire time until \u03c41, we consider its time evolution,\nE\u0307n,r = \u2212 \u0303(1)n,rP\u0303n,r + \u0303(2)n+1,rP\u0303n+1,r + \u0303(3)n+2,r\u22121P\u0303n+2,r\u22121 \u2212 1\nN \u2202n\n[ n(N \u2212 n)Pcontn,r (\u03c4 ) ] \u2212 \u03b3 n2 N2 [ Pcontn,r\u22121(\u03c4 ) \u2212 Pcontn,r (\u03c4 ) ] = \u2212 \u0303(1)n,rEn,r + \u0303(2)n+1,rEn+1,r + \u0303(3)n+2,r\u22121En+2,r\u22121 + E inn,r . (B25)\nEquation (B25) again allows us to bound the error by the integral over the one-norm of E in, as in Eq. (A38). To establish this, we need to bound terms of the form\nAk = \u2211 n,r nk Nk [ Pcontn,r (\u03c4 ) \u2212 Pcontn\u22121,r (\u03c4 ) ] . (B26)\nFirst note that due to the prefactor, we can neglect the contribution from the sum from n = 0 to n = N1\u2212\u03b5. For the sum from n = N1\u2212\u03b5 to N , we use n N1\u2212\u03b5 and Lemma 9 to write\nnk Nk (n + 2r) k Nk < nk Nk\n( 1 + 2k(ln N ) 2\nN1\u2212\u03b5\n) . (B27)\nThus we have\n|Ak| < \u2211 n,r nk Nk Pcontn,r (\u03c4 ) 2k(ln N )2 N1\u2212\u03b5 \u2192 0. (B28)\nWith this in mind, we write E inn,r =Fr (T\u0303n) { \u03b3n+1P\u0304n+1+2r \u2212 \u03b3nP\u0304n+2r \u2212 1\nN \u2202n[n(N \u2212 n)P\u0304n+2r]\n} + 2r n\nN\n( Pcontn\u22121,r \u2212 Pcontn,r ) + 2rN Pcontn+1,r + \u03b3 n\nN\n[ Pcontn+1,r \u2212 Pcontn,r + n2 N2 ( Pcontn,r \u2212 Pcontn+1,r + Pcontn+2,r\u22121 \u2212 Pcontn,r\u22121 )] . (B29)\nThe first line in Eq. (B29) is the same as for pure superradiance, given by Eq. (A36), and thus vanishes. In the second line, the first term is of the form given by Eq. (B26), but with an r out front. Since by Lemma 9, r grows only logarithmically with N , this contribution still vanishes. The second term in the second line vanishes also by Lemma 9. The terms proportional to \u03b3 are all of the form given by Eq. (B26) and vanish also.\nLemma 15. Approximate solution converges. For any \u03c4 < \u03b1 ln N and some \u03b1 > 0, P\u0303 (\u03c4 ) (Definition 7) converges to the exact solution P\u2217(\u03c4 ) (Definition 6) as N \u2192 \u221e,\n||P\u2217(\u03c4 ) \u2212 P\u0303 (\u03c4 )||1 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 N\u2192\u221e 0. (B30)\nProof. Similar to before, we define the error E (\u03c4 ) = P\u2217(\u03c4 ) \u2212 P\u0303 (\u03c4 ). We bound its norm by ||E (\u03c4 )|| < \u03b1 ln N max\n\u03c4\u2208[0,\u03b1 ln N] || 1P\u0303 (\u03c4 )||, (B31)\n013716-12\nwhere 1 is the difference of the evolution matrices for P\u2217 (Definition 6) and P\u0303 (Definition 7). Notably, all rates in 1 are O(r/N ) and thus can be bounded by N\u03b5\u22121 for any \u03b5 > 0. Thus,\n||E (\u03c4 )|| < \u03b1 ln(N )N\u03b5\u22121 \u2192 0. (B32)\nLemma 16. R> is asymptotically correct. For times \u03c41 < \u03c4 , R> [Eq. (13b)] converges to P\u2217 (Definition 6),\n5(\u03c4 ) = ||R>(\u03c4 ) \u2212 P\u2217(\u03c4 )|| \u2192 0. (B33) Proof. From the previous sections, we know that Rn,r (\u03c41) is a good approximation with the error vanishing. As before, we\ncan bound 5 by\n5(\u03c4 ) \u222b \u03c4\n\u03c41\nd\u03c4 \u2032|| 1R>(\u03c4 \u2032)||, (B34)\nwhere 1 is the difference between the linearized evolution matrix (Definition 10) and the full evolution (Definition 6). To bound the integral, we first evaluate the argument\n|| 1R>(\u03c4 )|| = N/2\u2211 r=0 N\u22122r\u2211 n=0 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2212 [ n N (1 \u2212 n \u2212 2r) + \u03b3 n N ] R>n,r (\u03c4 ) + (n + 1) [ \u2212n + 2r N + \u03b3 (N + 2)(N \u2212 2r \u2212 n + 1) N (N \u2212 2r)N \u2212 2r + 2) ] R>n+1,r (\u03c4 )\n+ \u03b3 N (n + 2)(n + 1)(N \u2212 r + 2) (N \u2212 2r + 2)(N \u2212 2r + 3)R > n+2,r\u22121 + \u03b3 N (r + 1)\n[ (N \u2212 2r \u2212 n \u2212 1)(N \u2212 2r \u2212 n) (N \u2212 2r)(N \u2212 2r \u2212 1) \u2212 1 ] R>n,r+1(\u03c4 ) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223. (B35)\nFirst we note that subleading terms can be neglected, as even bounding them individually leads to a vanishing contribution. In particular, since we can bound terms containing n/N by N\u2212\u03b41 e\u2212\u03c4\u2212\u03c41 , all such terms can be neglected. We are left with\n|| 1R>(\u03c4 )|| = N/2\u2211 r=0 N\u22122r\u22121\u2211 n=0 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223n(n + 1)N R>n+1,r (\u03c4 ) \u2212 n 2 N R>n,r (\u03c4 ) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223, (B36) where we have also dropped the vanishing term\nN/2\u2211 r=0 (N \u2212 2r)2 N R>N\u22122r,r (\u03c4 ) \u2192 0. (B37)\nSimilar to Lemma 8, we can write Eq. (B36) as\n|| 1R>(\u03c4 )|| = N/2\u2211 r=0 N\u22122r\u22121\u2211 n=0 n N \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 N/2\u2211 q=r N\u22122r\u2032\u22121\u2211 m=n ( q r )( m n ) e\u2212\u03b3 q(\u03c4\u2212\u03c41 )/N e\u2212m(\u03c4\u2212\u03c41 )(e\u03b3 (\u03c4\u2212\u03c41 )/N \u2212 1)q\u2212r (e\u03c4\u2212\u03c41 \u2212 1)m\u2212n\n\u00d7 [(m + 1)Rm+1(\u03c41)Fq(Tm+1(\u03c41)) \u2212 (n \u2212 1)Rm(\u03c41)Fq(Tm(\u03c41))] \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223. (B38)\nThe term in square brackets is again always positive, so we drop the absolute value signs. To show this, consider\n(m + 1)Rm+1Fq,m+1 \u2212 (n \u2212 1)RmFq,m = Rm+1Fq,m+1 { 2 + (n \u2212 1) [ 1 \u2212 (\n1 + 1 m\n) exp ( \u2212 N 2e\u2212\u03c41 m(m + 1) )( Tm(\u03c41)\nTm+1(\u03c41)\n)q]} . (B39)\nIn the regime m < N\u03bc for some \u03bc < \u03b41/2, the exponential makes the negative term vanish. In contrast, if m > N\u03bc, the fraction Tm(\u03c41)/Tm+1(\u03c41) is smaller than 1, such that we can bound it by 1 and use the result given by Eq. (A50).\nDropping the absolute value signs in Eq. (B36) means that only the boundary terms survive (up to extra terms that vanish even faster),\n|| 1R>(\u03c4 )|| = N/2\u2211 r=0 (N \u2212 2r)2 N R>N\u22122r,r (\u03c4 ) < N\u2212\u03b41 e\u2212N (\u03c4\u2212\u03c41 ). (B40)\nIntegrating this from time \u03c41 to \u221e yields an upper bound to the error that goes to zero as N \u2192 \u221e. Note that for this to work, it is crucial that we include the decay of r in Eq. (B10). If we had not included this term in the linearized rates, the distribution in r would remain stationary rather than decay and lead to an error growing in time.\n013716-13\n[1] R. H.
