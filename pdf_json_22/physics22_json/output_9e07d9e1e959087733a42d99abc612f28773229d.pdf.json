            "text": "One of the major goals in current heavy-ion collisions is to locate the critical\npoint (CP) in the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter predicted by the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).1\u20134 Lattice QCD has shown that there occurs\na smooth crossover from hadronic phase to the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) phase at \u00b5B = 0. 5\u20137 QCD based model calculations indicate that the transition could be a first-order at large \u00b5B . 8,9 The endpoint of the first-order phase transition to the crossover is referred to as the critical point.10\u201313 However, Lattice QCD calcula-\ntions at finite \u00b5B face numerical challenges in computing. The location of the CP is highly theoretically uncertain. Investigations from heavy-ion experiments, such\nas the Beam Energy Scan (BES) II program at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC),14,15 and phenomenological modeling are required.\nFluctuations of conserved quantities, which behave differently between the\nhadronic and the QGP phases, are normally considered to be promising signatures for the QCD phase transition.3,4, 16\u201327 The singularity at the CP, at which the tran-\nsition is believed to be the second-order, may cause enhancement of fluctuations if fireballs created in the collision pass the CP region during the time evolution.28\u201331\nIn heavy-ion collisions, in analogy to the critical opalescence phenomenon observed in Quantum Electrodynamics,32 large density fluctuation of late-stage baryon num-\n1\nar X\niv :2\n20 3.\n01 49\n0v 2\n[ nu\ncl -t\nh] 2\n7 M\nay 2\n02 2\nbers is expected to develop for the system near the CP due to a rapid increase of correlation length.1,33,34 Strong baryon density fluctuations should be observed in\nexperiments at kinetic freeze-out if such fluctuations can survive during final-state\ninteractions and hadronic evolution of the system.\nIt is suggested that the expected large baryon density fluctuations near the\nCP can be expressed in terms of density-density correlator of baryon numbers, which exhibiting a fractal and scale invariant behavior.34\u201336 These fluctuations are\nsupposed to form a unique pattern of self-similar or intermittency behavior of finite state particles in high energy collisions.34,37\u201339 Intermittency refers to the property of scale invariance, fractality and a stochastic nature of the underlying scaling law.36\nIt can be measured by calculation of a scaled factorial moment (SFM) at various system scales in transverse momentum space.34,40 The advantage of using SFM is\nthat it can characterize the non-statistical fluctuations in momentum spectra, which\nis supposed to be connected with the dynamics of particle production.\nThe last decade has witnessed remarkably exciting experimental explorations of\nintermittency and fractality in high energy collisions. A systematic search for QCD\ncritical fluctuations has been performed by NA49 and NA61/SHINE collaborations at CERN SPS with measurements of intermittency in A+A collisions.40\u201342 At RHIC energies, the studies on both charged particles43 and strangeness44 in Au+Au col-\nlisions at BES-I energies are reported. With the LHC at CERN ushering in a new\nera of TeV-scale high energy physics, the CMS collaboration has measured SFM and intermittency in pp collisions up to 8 TeV.45 It is expected that fractality or\nself-similarity, analogous to that encountered in complex non-linear systems, might\nopen a new way leading towards deeper insight into the CP and phase transition of\nQCD.\nAt the same time, different phenomenological models have been used to study\nthe unique behavior of SFMs and intermittency under various underlying mechanisms.46\u201351 With a Critical Monte-Carlo (CMC) model belonging to the 3D Ising\nuniversality class, it is found that the self-similar or intermittency nature of particle\ncorrelations is closely related to the large baryon density fluctuation associated with the critical point.46 By including hadronic mean-field potentials47 or hydrodynamical descriptions48 into the data sample of a transport UrQMD model, the result\nexhibits a clear self-similar behavior. It infers that intermittency is associated with\nthe mechanism of evolution of the medium produced in heavy-ion collisions.\nIntermittency is measured by calculations of SFM in momentum space at var-\nious scales. Whereas, the single-particle multiplicity spectra of late-stage particles in heavy-ion collisions are largely influenced by background effects.52\u201355 In experiments, insufficient detector efficiency56,57 will also modify the value of SFM. To\nunderstand the underlying physics of this measurement, a careful study on the non-\ncritical effects to get a clean signal is needed. After that, we can compare results\namong different experiments and with those from theoretical or phenomenological\npredictions.\nThis paper contains a review of the present study on intermittency in heavy-ion\ncollisions over the last years. In Section 2, we introduce the method of intermit-\ntency analysis and the necessary formalism. Section 3 discusses the estimation and\nsubtraction of background contributions in the calculation of SFMs. In section 4,\nthe efficiency correction formula on SFM is derived. Section 5 gives an overview of\nexperimental measurements on intermittency in current heavy-ion collisions. Sec-\ntion 6 is devoted to phenomenological model results on the subject and the search\nfor power-laws. Conclusions and outlooks are summarized in Section 7."

            "text": "In high-energy collisions, a power-law density fluctuation is proposed to be de-\ntectable in momentum space through intermittency analysis. The observables of\nour interests in this analysis are chosen to be sensitive to the power-law singularity\nof the density-density correlation function. The SFM of multiplicity distributions of final state particles is suggested as one of the most suitable quantities.34,40 For this\npurpose, a selected D-dimensional momentum space is partitioned into equal-sized\ncells. The qth-order SFM is defined as:\nFq(M) = \u3008 1 MD \u2211MD i=1 ni(ni \u2212 1) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (ni \u2212 q + 1)\u3009 \u3008 1 MD \u2211MD i=1 ni\u3009q , (1)\nwhere M is the number of cells in one dimension, ni is the measured number of particles in the ith cell, and the angular bracket denotes an average over the event\nsample.\nFor the system near the critical point, it is expected to observe a scaling or power-law behavior of the SFM on the partitioned number of cells MD, given M is\nlarge enough:\nFq(M) \u223c (MD)\u03c6q ,M \u2192\u221e. (2)\nHere \u03c6q is called intermittency index which specifies the strength of the self-similar property. The method of using SFM to search for the critical fluctuation was firstly proposed in Refs52,58 several years ago. By using the effective action of a 3D Ising system belonging to the same universality class of the QCD critical point,59\u201361 the critical \u03c62 is predicted to be 5 6 for baryon density 34 and 23 for pion density. 62\nBesides the power-law behavior of SFMs on the partitioned numbers as de-\nscribed above, another promising relation between SFMs of different orders is suggested:63\u201365\nFq(M) \u221d F2(M)\u03b2q, (3)\nwhere \u03b2q = \u03c6q/\u03c62. According to Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory, the power-law behavior of Fq(M) \u223cMD might not be observed near the QCD critical point since \u03c6q depends on particular critical parameters which would vary with temperatures of the system and are unknown in nuclear collisions.63,64 However, \u03b2q is independent of these parameters and thus the power-law behavior of Fq(M) on F2(M) is feasible to measure in experiments of nuclear-nuclear collisions.\nThe scaling exponent \u03bd specifies the power-law behavior of Fq(M) on F2(M)\nand quantitatively describes the values of \u03b2q: 63\u201365\n\u03b2q \u221d (q \u2212 1)\u03bd . (4)\nThis critical exponent \u03bd, which is supposed to be independent on the chosen\nvalues of specific critical parameters, can be used to investigate the presence of intermittency in the QCD phase transition.63\u201366 Theoretical prediction for the critical\nvalue of \u03bd is equal to 1.304 in the full phase space based on Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory,63 and 1.0 from calculations of a two-dimensional Ising model.64"

            "heading": "3. Background Subtraction",
            "text": "In the calculations of SFMs, it is important to estimate and subtract trivial contri-\nbutions from background. It has been found that the values of the measured SFMs\ncan be significantly modified by adding uncorrelated particles as a background to the event samples containing self-similar signals.54 These background effects should\nbe eliminated in the intermittency analysis.\n3.1. Mixed Event Method\nBy analyzing the NA49 and NA61 results, it is shown that the experimentally mea-\nsured scaling behavior of SFMs and the intermittency index can be reproduced by\nadding more than 90% uncorrelated random tracks into the event sample generated by the CMC model.40,67 In this purpose, they propose to use the mixed event method to estimate background contributions.40,68 Mixed events are constructed\nby randomly selecting particles from original events while reproducing the same\nmultiplicity distributions. The correlations between pairs of particles which exist\nin the original event, are eliminated in the mixed event samples since each particle\nnow is chosen from different events. By assuming that multiplicity distributions of\nmeasured particles in each partitioned cell can be simply divided into background\nand critical contributions, the correlator \u2206Fq(M), supposed to contain only critical contributions, is defined as:\n\u2206Fq(M) = F data q (M)\u2212 Fmixq (M). (5)\nAfter subtracting background contributions, the intermittency index \u03c6q can be\nobtained from \u2206Fq(M) instead of Fq(M) by using Eq. (2).\n3.2. Cumulative Variable Method\nThe cumulative variable method was proposed for intermittency analysis in Refs69,70 several years ago. It has been proved to be able to effectively reduce the distortions of a non-uniform single-particle spectrum.69,71\nAssuming the variable x, e.g., momentum px or py, is measured by a density distribution function \u03c1(x). The cumulative variable X(x) is defined as the transformation of 69,70\nX(x) =\n\u222b x xmin\n\u03c1(x)dx\u222b xmax xmin \u03c1(x)dx , (6)\nwhere xmin and xmax are minimum and maximum values of the selected variable x.\nThe advantage of the cumulative variable X(x) is that the value of the new\nvariable does not depend on particular variable x but on its density distribution\nfunction \u03c1(x), which provides a way to compare results among different experiments.\nThe other benefit is that the probability distribution of X(x) is uniform which can remove the dependence of intermittency on density distribution of \u03c1(x).69\nIn the calculation of Fq(M) of cumulative variable in a 2D momentum region, the transverse momentum space of pxpy is transfer to the one of pXpY . To be clear, we denote the Fq(M) after cumulative transformation as CFq(M). The process of fitting intermittency index \u03c6cq from CFq(M) is the same as \u03c62 from F2(M) by Eq. (2).\nTo verify the validity of the this method, the CMC model34,46 belonging to the\n3D Ising universality is applied to generate event samples incorporating critically\ncorrelated particles in momentum space. The CMC model involves large density\nfluctuations risen from the self-similar correlations among particles and leads to the intermittency index of \u03c62 = 5 6 . 34,46 Figure 1 (a) shows the F2(M) and CF2(M) as a function of M2 from the CMC model in a double-logarithmic scale. It is clearly\nobserved that both F2(M) (black stars) and CF2(M) (blue circles) obey a good power-law dependence on the number of division bins. The fitted \u03c62 is equal to \u03c6c2 within statistical uncertainty. It implies that the intermittency behavior keeps\nunchanged by applying the cumulative variable method to a critical event sample\nwith pure self-similar fluctuations.\nWe further test the method by adding background fluctuations into the signal.\nThe CMC samples are contaminated by particles with a Gaussian distribution as\nbackground by a mixed ratio of \u03bb = 95%. In Fig. 1 (b), one observes that the directly calculated F2(M) deviates substantially from the power-law dependence on M 2 and can not be fitted by the relation of Eq. (2). However, CF2(M) still follows the same scaling behavior with increasing M2 as that in Fig. 1 (a). The fitted \u03c6c2 is found to be equal to the one in the pure CMC event sample. It confirms that the cumulative\nvariable method is able to effectively erase background effects in the intermittency\nanalysis."

            "text": "Besides background subtraction, efficiency correction for SFMs is also an important\naspect in the calculations of intermittency. In experimental measurement, some\nparticles are missing due to a limited capacity of the detector, which leads to the\nmeasured multiplicity distribution to be different from the originally produced one\nin the momentum space. Therefore, the calculated SFM will be changed accord-\ningly. To recover the true SFM from the experimentally measured one, a cell-by-cell efficiency correction method is suggested in Ref.71\nThe probability function of p(n) is related to the one of p(N) with:72,73 p(n) = \u2211 N W (n|N)p(N). (7) Here W (n|N) is the probability of experimentally measured n particles, given N originally produced particles in the event. In general, W (n|N) can be approximated by a binomial distribution as:72\u201374\nW (n|N) = B(n,N ; ) = N ! n!(N \u2212 n)! n(1\u2212 )N\u2212n, (8)\nwhere is the particle detection efficiency.\nBased on Eq. (7) and (8), the true factorial moment f trueq = \u3008N(N \u2212 1)...(N \u2212 q + 1)\u3009 will be restored by dividing the measured moment fmeasuredq = \u3008n(n \u2212 1)...(n\u2212 q+1)\u3009, with certain power of the experimental detector efficiency :72,74,75\nf correctedq = fmeasuredq q = \u3008n(n\u2212 1)...(n\u2212 q + 1)\u3009 q . (9)\nThis method has been extensively used for efficiency corrections on the high-moment studies in experiments.25,26,74,75\nWe use the same strategy in the intermittency analysis. The q-th moment \u3008ni(ni \u2212 1)...(ni \u2212 q + 1)\u3009 of SFM in each bin is corrected according to Eq. (9). Then, the SFM defined in Eq. (1) can be corrected as:\nF correctedq (M) = \u3008 1M2\n\u2211M2 i=1 ni(ni\u22121)\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7(ni\u2212q+1) \u0304iq \u3009\n\u3008 1M2 \u2211M2 i=1 ni \u0304i \u3009q\n. (10)\nWhere ni is the number of particles located in the i-th cell. \u0304i represents the event average of the mean efficiency of all the particles in the i-th cell, which is calcu-\nlated by \u3008 \u2211ni j=1 j i\nni \u3009. The efficiency correction of Eq. (10) is known as the cell-by-cell\nmethod.71\nIn order to test the accuracy of the cell-by-cell method, we apply the tracking\nefficiencies in the real experiment to the event samples generated by the transport UrQMD model.71 The experimental detection efficiency of tracks can be gained\nfrom Monte-Carlo embedding technique which considering effects including detector efficiency, acceptance, decays and interaction losses in the collisions.56,76 In the\nSTAR experiment at RHIC, the efficiency of the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) or the Time-of-Flight (TOF) detector is a function of transverse momentum.56,76\nFigure 2 (a) and 3 (a) show the detection efficiencies of protons as a function of pT in the TPC detector and in the TPC+TOF detectors, respectively.\nThe tracking efficiency is then employed into the UrQMD event samples by\nkeeping or discarding a particle based on the probability obtained from the pT - dependent efficiencies. Figure 2 (b) shows the original true F2(M) (open squares), measured F2(M) (solid stars) after discarding particles and efficiency corrected SFM (solid cross) calculated by the cell-by-cell method, respectively. We observe\nthat the values of the measured F2(M) are smaller than those of the original true ones, especially in the region of large M2. However, the efficiency corrected F2(M) agree well with the original true ones. Fig. 3 (b) shows the calculations for the\ncase of TPC+TOF detection efficiency. The corrected SFMs are confirmed to be\nconsistent with the original true ones.\nTherefore, the proposed cell-by-cell method provides an accurate and effective\nway of efficiency corrections in the measurement of SFMs in heavy-ion collisions.\nThis method has been adopted recently in the intermittency analysis in the STAR experiment.43"

The goal is\npursued by measurements of correlations and fluctuations including intermittency,\nwhich are supposed to be promising signatures of the QCD phase transition.\n5.1. Results from NA49 and NA61 Collaborations at SPS\nIn the experiments at SPS, the search for the QCD critical point is attempted by\nNA49 experiment through changing system sizes of colliding nuclei (p+p, C+C,\nSi+Si, Pb+Pb) at 158A GeV/c and NA61/SHINE experiment by varying energies\nin p+p,p+Pb, Be+Be, Ar+Sc and Xe+La collisions.\nFigure 4 presents F2(M) as a function of M 2 for data and mixed events at \u221a sNN = 17.3 GeV in C+C, Si+Si and Pb+Pb collisions measured in NA49 experiment.\nIt is observed that F2(M) in the Si+Si collisions are larger than those calculated from mixed events when M2 is large. The correlator \u2206F2(M) of Si+Si collision calculated by Eq. 5 is found to obey a good power-law dependence on M2 with \u03c62 = 0.96\u00b1 0.16 which approaches theoretical prediction,34 indicating a typical property of intermittency in this collision. However, the F2(M) are almost overlap with those of mixed events in the C+C and Pb+Pb systems, suggesting that intermittency is\nnot visible in these collisions. The reason could be that the critical self-similar\nfluctuations can not develop in the small size of C+C system. As for the Pb+Pb\ncollision, the signal might be diluted during the longer evolution of the hadronic phase.40\nFigure 5 illustrates the preliminary results from NA61 on the second-order SFMs\nof proton numbers in 0-20% central Ar+Sc collisions at 150A GeV/c and in 0-10% central Pb+Pb collisions at 30A GeV/c.77 The cumulative variable method is used\nhere to subtract background effects of the measurement. It is observed that F2(M) is nearly flat with increasing M2, indicating the absence of an intermittency behavior\nin Ar+Sc or in Pb+Pb collisions.\n5.2. Results from STAR Experiment at RHIC\nTo explore the QCD phase diagram, the STAR Collaboration has measured a few\nexperimental observables which may signature the QCD phase transition and CP\nat RHIC BES-I energies. In particularly, some appealing non-monotonic behaviors\nof the measurements have been observed in Au+Au collisions at energies around 20 < \u221a sNN < 30 GeV. 25,78\u201381\nRecently, the STAR Collaboration reports the preliminary results on the first\nmeasurements on intermittency of charged particles in Au+Au collisions at \u221a sNN= 7.7-200 GeV.43 The SFMs of p, p\u0304, K\u00b1 and \u03c0\u00b1 have been measured within |\u03b7| < 0.5 in a 2D transverse momentum space. The SFMs are corrected for the finite tracking\nreconstruction efficiencies by the cell-by-cell method. Figure 6 shows the Fq(M) of both the data (solid symbols) and the mixed events (open symbols) for identified charged particles in the 0 \u2212 5% most central Au+Au collision at BES-I energies.\nThe Fq(M) can be calculated up to the sixth-order based on the event statistics. It is observed that Fq(M) data is larger than Fq(M) mix at the region of large M2 values at various energies and thus a deviation of \u2206Fq(M) from zero is found in these collisions.\nAfter subtracting the background contributions, the critical related exponent \u03bd,\nwhich extracted from the \u2206Fq(M)/\u2206F2(M) scaling according to Eq. (3) and (4), exhibits a non-monotonic behavior on energy with a dip located between 20 GeV\nand 30 GeV in the most central Au+Au collisions, as shown in Fig. 7. The non-\nmonotonic energy dependence of \u03bd needs to be understood with more theoretical\ninputs, especially a reliable theoretical calculation in a 2D transverse momentum\nspace with the same acceptance cuts used in the experimental analysis."

Scaled Factorial Moments of Protons in the Transport\nUrQMD Model\nIn this section, we illustrate the SFMs of proton density calculated in different\nenergies and centralities by using the UrQMD model. The UrQMD (Ultra relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics) is a transport model82,83 which is widely used to\nsimulate relativistic heavy-ion collisions with a wide energy coverage ranging from\nSIS energies to top of the RHIC energy. Since the model does not include any\ncorrelations or fluctuations related to the QCD phase transition or CP, it is feasible\nto be used to study background effects or other trivial fluctuations in the search of\nthe QCD CP in heavy-ion collisions.\nThe cascade mode of the UrQMD model with the version 2.3 is applied to produce events in Au+Au collision at \u221a sNN = 7.7, 11.5, 19.6, 27, 39, 62.4 and 200 GeV.

The value of \u03c6c2, which is fitted from SFMs by the cumulative variable method, is found to be near zero at the measured energies.\nIn Fig. 9, we show the F2(M) and CF2(M) at \u221a sNN = 19.6 GeV in various collision centralities. The values of \u03c62 calculated from directly measured SFMs slightly rise from the most central to the most peripheral collisions. However, \u03c6c2 calculated from CF2(M) show a flat centrality dependence with all the values near zero. The results verify that the background of the non-critical contributions can be efficiently\nwiped off by using the proposed cumulative variable method in the UrQMD model.\n6.2. Intermittency in the CMC Model belonging to the 3D Ising\nUniversality Class\nBased on an effective action of the three-dimensional Ising universality class, there\nexists a power-law singularity of density-density correlator for small momentum transfer ~k:34\nlim |~k|\u21920\n\u3008\u03c1~k\u03c1 \u2217 ~k \u3009 \u223c |~k|\u2212dF . (11)\nHere, \u03c1~k represents the baryon-number density in momentum space by Fourier transforms from the one in coordinate space. \u3008\u03c1~k\u03c1 \u2217 ~k \u3009 is the density-density correlator of particle pairs in momentum space. Eq. (11) shows a fractal geometry with\na power-law pattern in momentum space for critical systems belonging to the 3D\nIsing universality class.\nIn the study on intermittency in heavy-ion collisions, the CMC model34 is widely\nused to simulate critical event samples incorporating self-similar fluctuations. The\nMonte-Carlo simulations involving critical density fluctuations related to Eq. (11)\ncan be simulated by the algorithm of Levy random walk, which requiring the prob-\nability density \u03c1(p) between two adjacent walks follows:\n\u03c1(p) = \u03bdp\u03bdmin\n1\u2212 (pmin/pmax)\u03bd p\u22121\u2212\u03bd . (12)\nHere \u03bd is the Levy exponent directly connected to the intermittency index, p rep-\nresents the momentum distance of two adjacent particles, pmin and pmax are the minimum and maximum values of p. The parameters of Levy function are set to be \u03bd = 1/6 and pmin/pmax = 10 \u22127 for critical events leading to the second-order\nintermittency \u03c62 = 5 6 . The precise rules of the Levy algorithm and more details about the CMC model could be found in Refs.34,84\nIn Fig. 10, the black circles show F2(M) as a function of M 2 and the solid black line is the fitting according to Eq. (2). The results are calculated from a\ngenerated sample of 600 critical events. The Levy algorithm is parameterized to\nproduce px and py distributions of particles in transverse momentum space and the multiplicity is set to obey a Poisson distribution with the mean value \u3008N\u3009 = 20. It is found that F2(M) from CMC events does obey a good power-law dependence on M2 with the fitting slope \u03c62 = 0.834 \u00b1 0.001. It infers that the CMC model could excellently reproduce the intermittency behavior related to the self-similar\ncorrelations of Eq. (11). The open red triangles are the results calculated from the\nUrQMD event sample by the same mean multiplicity as used in the CMC model. It gives a flat trend of the dependence on M2. The reason is that this model does not\nincorporate any self-similar fluctuations in the mechanism of particle production\nprocess.\nThe definition of the relative density fluctuation of baryons, \u2206n, is 30,31\n\u2206n = \u3008(\u03b4n)2\u3009 \u3008n\u30092 = \u3008n2\u3009 \u2212 \u3008n\u30092 \u3008n\u30092 . (13)\nThe angle bracket represents the average over the whole event sample.\nMeasurements of SFMs to get intermittency index and calculations of \u2206n can be performed simultaneously in the same CMC event sample.46 The solid black line\nin Fig. 11 displays the second-order intermittency index as a function of the relative\ndensity fluctuation. We observe a monotonically increase of \u03c62 on \u2206n. It reveals a fact that great intermittency can be achieved if large baryon density fluctuations are\ndeveloped for the system near the QCD critical point. It supplies another experi-\nmentally measurable variable to obtain density fluctuations besides measurement of light nuclei productions in the coalescence model.30,31 The colored dash lines in the\nsame figure show the STAR measured \u2206n in the 0-10% central Au+Au collisions at \u221a sNN = 7.7, 11.5, 14.5, 19.6, 27, 39, 62.4 and 200 GeV, respectively. 79\nOnce the connection between \u03c62 and \u2206n is gained, the intermittency index can be obtained by measuring the density fluctuations within the same event sample,\nor vice versa. In this way, we can calculate \u03c62 indirectly by mapping the experimental measured \u2206n into the relation. In Fig. 12, the red stars show the energy\ndependence of indirectly calculated \u03c62 in the 0-10% central Au+Au collisions. We observe a non-monotonic dependence of \u03c62 on collision energy with a peak structure at around 20-30 GeV. It indicates that the strength of intermittency is strongest in this energy region. For comparison, data from the NA4940,41 (blue symbols) and the NA61/SHINE67,68 (green crosses) experiments are also plotted in the same figure.\nIn Si+Si collisions, the \u03c62 is found to be close to the value of theoretical expectation which is illustrated as the black arrow. The black circles represent \u03c62 from the UrQMD calculations, which give a flat energy dependence with all the values\naround zeros. It is because that no critical self-similar mechanism is implemented\nin this model.\n6.3. Intermittency Analysis in the UrQMD Model with Hadronic\nPotentials\nAs has been shown in Section 6.1, there is no intermittency behavior in the origi-\nnal UrQMD model after subtracting background contributions. Recently, attempts\nhave been made to give obvious correlations of proton pairs and intermittency by introducing hadronic potentials into the UrQMD model with the mean-field mode.47\nBy treating potentials of both the formed and performed hadrons from string\nfragmentation by the same means, the density-dependent potentials can be written as :47,85\nU = \u03b1( \u03c1h \u03c10 ) + \u03b2( \u03c1h \u03c10 )\u03b3 , (14)\nwhere \u03c1h represents the hadronic density, and \u03c10 is the nuclear matter saturation density.\nThe momentum-dependent term of hadronic potential is defined as:\nUmd = \u2211 k=1,2 tkmd \u03c10 \u222b dp\u2032\nf(r,p\u2032)\n1 + [(p\u2212 p\u2032)/akmd]2 . (15)\nHere tmd and amd are parameters. More details about the implementation of hadronic potentials into the model could be found in Refs.47,85\nFigure 13 illustrates the second-order F2(M) and the correlator \u2206F2(M) calculated in the UrQMD data samples both with and without hadronic potentials in\nAr+Sc collisions at 40A GeV/c. As shown in the left figure of the UrQMD model\nwith hadronic potential (UrQMD/M), F2(M) of original events (solid blue squares) are larger than those of mixed events (solid blue circles) at the large M2 regions.\nIn Fig. 13 (b), the correlator \u2206F2(M) of hadronic potentials shows a power-law behavior with M2. The extracted \u03c62 = 0.32 \u00b1 0.03 is similar to the one measured in the NA61 experiment.68,86 As for the UrQMD cascade model (UrQMD/C), the\nvalues of F2(M) of real events are almost overlapped with those of mixed events and thus \u2206F2(M) is around 0 in this case. It could infer that the power-law character of \u2206F2(M) in the UrQMD/M model is introduced by the hadronic interaction, particular nuclear potentials which cause enhancements of proton pairs with small relative momenta.47\nFigure 14 demonstrates centrality dependence of \u03c62 in 0-5%, 5-10%, and 10-15% central Ar+Sc collisions, respectively. The calculations from the UrQMD model\nwith (solid blue squares) and without (open pink squares) hadronic potential are\nplotted along with the NA61 preliminary experimental results (solid red stars). The\nsecond-order intermittency index \u03c62 calculated in the UrQMD/C model is found to be nearly zero. For the UrQMD/M model, the \u03c62 slightly increases from the most central to the mid-central collisions, in coincide with the experimental result for the cases of purity > 85%.68,86 This centrality dependence could be explained by a shortened hadronic freeze-out phase with decreasing size of the system.47\n6.4. Observation of Intermittency in the Hybrid UrQMD-hydro\nModel\nApart from the introduce of hadronic potentials into the transport UrQMD model\nto obtain intermittency, another attempt is the hybrid UrQMD-hydro model which\nincorporating both transport and hydrodynamical descriptions of heavy-ion collisions.48,87 Hydrodynamic description has been suggested as an effective tool to express the hot and dense stage of collision reactions and model phase transitions.87 In\nthis study, the intermediate hydrodynamic calculation is applied to the microscopic transport computation in initial condition and freeze-out process.83,87\nIn Fig. 15, the values of lnFq(M) are shown as a function of lnM 2 of charged particles in Au+Au collisions at 10A GeV/c from the UrQMD-hydro model with\ntwo different equations of state (EoS). The Fq(M) of various orders are carried out in \u03b7 \u2212 \u03c6 space and the background has been subtracted by the cumulative variable method. The value of lnFq(M) is found to linearly develop with increasing lnM 2 for both hadronic EoS (red circles) and chiral one (blue squares) in the (0\u20135%) most\ncentral collisions. It implies that the observed scaling behavior or intermittency is\nclosely related to the evolution of the medium produced in the collision. In addition,\nthe intermittency indices of chiral EoS are found to be larger than those of hadronic\none. It could be account for the production of cascading particles in partonic level and the hydrodynamic evolution in the chiral EoS case.48"

            "text": "In this review, we have summarized current status of the exploration of the QCD\ncritical point via intermittency analysis in heavy-ion collisions. The main results\nfrom both experimental measurements and phenomenological model calculations\nare presented. We highlighted two important issues, i.e. background subtraction\nand efficiency correction, in this analysis. It provides a way to obtain a clean signal\nin the calculations of intermittency.\nAlthough the main contributions from background have been eliminated by using\nthe proposed cumulative variable method, the intermittency index calculated in\nthe transport UrQMD model which does not incorporate any critical self-similar\nfluctuations is not exact zero, as shown in Fig. 8 and 9. It might attribute to some\neffects which still remained in the results, such as correlation of protons caused by Coulomb repulsion and Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics,40 or width of the experimental momentum resolution.54 More investigations on these effects should help to obtain\na clear and convincing result.\nOn the search of self-similar and intermittency behavior in current heavy-ion ex-\nperiments, the NA49 Collaboration has found a clear signature in Si+Si collisions at\u221a sNN = 17.3 GeV, 40 with the measured second-order intermittency index touching the theoretic expectation calculated in a critical model.34 Preliminary results from NA61/SHINE77,88 of proton numbers in Ar+Sc collisions at 150A GeV/c and in\nthe most central Pb+Pb collisions at 30A GeV/c exhibit no evidence of power-law\nincrease with increasing number of division cells. However, the RHIC/STAR measurement43 at the near energy region illustrates a non-monotonic dependence of a\nscaling exponent on collision energy in the most central Au+Au collisions with a\ndip at around 20-30 GeV. Further investigations should be done to compare results\ncoming from both the STAR and the NA61 heavy-ion experimental data despite\nthe differences between two detectors.\nThe RHIC experiment has updated a few detectors and finished taking the second phase of Beam Energy Scan program during 2018-2021.14,15 It could be exciting\nand anticipated if intermittency would be measured by the STAR Collaboration on\nthe new data with high statistics and improved particle identification to explore the\nCP in the QCD phase diagram.\nIn addition to the benefits from the upgraded facilities discussed above, the\nlarge data samples that collected in the high luminosity phase at BES-II may bring\ncomputing difficulties since the calculation of SFMs at very small scales requires\na huge computational effort which may prevent its implementation in experimen-\ntal analysis. A new computational technique, compared to conventional methods,\nis suggested to be much more efficient and prominent in the calculations of the second-order SFM with increase of the dimension of space.89 The technique is also\nsupposed to be a useful tool for recognizing weak signals which may be hidden in\nthe background with strong noises.\nWith the development of modern computer hardware and artificial intelligence, machine learning (ML),90,91 as a data-driven method, may be another intriguing direction for future investigations. Based on a recent study,92 a dynamical edge\nconvolution plus point cloud neural network shows a strong pattern recognition\nability in identifying events with self-similar fluctuations. It can figure out the most\nmajority of signal particles which could be used for decision-making in Monte-Carlo\nevents. It is interesting to investigate whether this cutting-edge ML method would\nbe also helpful to pick out possibly existing weak intermittency signals associated\nwith critical phenomena, which encountered in the NA61 experiment."
