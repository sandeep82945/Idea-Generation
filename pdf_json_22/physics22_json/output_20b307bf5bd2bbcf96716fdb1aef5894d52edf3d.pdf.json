    "abstractText": "In the KdV context we put forward a continuous version of the binary Darboux transformation (aka the double commutation method). Our approach is based on the Riemann-Hilbert problem and yields a new explicit formula for perturbation of the negative spectrum of a wide class of step-type potentials without changing the rest of the scattering data. This extends the previously known formulas for inserting/removing finitely many bound states to arbitrary sets of negative spectrum of arbitrary nature. In the KdV context our method offers same benefits as the classical binary Darboux transformation does.",

            "text": "As the title suggests, we are concerned with the binary Darboux transformation in the context of the Korteweg-de Vries equation (KdV). The literature on the Darboux transformation goes back to the nineteenth century and is immensely extensive and diverse. We only review some of what is directly related to our paper and where the interested reader may find further references. The very term appears to be introduced in 1985 by Babich-Matveev-Salle [3] in the context of the Toda lattice and then extended to the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation (see the influential 1991 book [44] by Matveev and Salle). The name owes to the fact that the single Darboux transformation (also know as Crum, elementary, or standard) is applied twice: to the associated AKNS system and its conjugate. We also refer the interested reader to Ling et al [39] and the extensive literature cited therein and to Cieslinski [4] where the binary Darboux transformation is revisited from a different point of view. Note that the binary Darboux transformation was originally introduced to generate explicit solutions to integrable systems by algebraic means (c.f. [31, 44]) and the inverse scattering transform (IST) was not directly used (while our approach is based on the IST).\nDate: March, 2023. 2020 Mathematics Subject Classification. 34L25, 37K15, 47B35. Key words and phrases. KdV equation, Darboux transformation, Riemann-Hilbert problem. The author is supported in part by the NSF grant DMS-2009980. The author would like to thank the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences for support and hospitality during the programme Dispersive Hydrodynamics when work on this paper was undertaken (EPSRC Grant Number EP/R014604/1).\n1\nIt is interesting to note that what in the Darboux transformation community is referred to as the binary Darboux transformation is, in fact, also known in spectral theory of Sturm-Liouville operators as the double commutation method introduced in 1951 by Gelfand and Levitan in their seminal paper [19] in the context of their ground breaking study of the inverse spectral problem for Sturm-Liouville operators. The name seems however to be cast by Deift [8] in 1978 as the method rests on applying twice a commutation formula from operator theory. Note that Gelfand and Levitan did not use commutation arguments but relied on transformation operator techniques (see also the book [37, Section 6.6] by Levitan). The full treatment of the double commutation method is given by Gesztesy et al [20]-[25] in the 1990s (see also the extensive literature cited therein). The double commutation method was introduced to study the effect of inserting/removing eigenvalues in spectral gaps on spectral properties of the underlying 1D Schro\u0308dinger operators while the binary Darboux transformation, as we have mentioned, has been primarily a tool to produce explicit solutions. This is likely a reason why we could not find the literature where the two would be explicitly linked1.\nThe main feature of the Darboux transformation (both, single and binary) is that it allows us to add or remove finitely many eigenvalues of the underlying system without altering the rest of the spectrum, which offers a powerful tool to study completely integrable systems. We are concerned with altering certain types of continuous spectrum too. More specifically, in the context of the KdV equation we introduce a broad class of the initial profiles, referred below to as step-type (see Definition 3.4), that admits an extension of the binary Darboux transformation allowing us to perturb (in particular, add or remove) the negative spectrum in nearly unrestricted way without affecting the rest of the scattering data. This class includes, as a very particular case, initial profiles approaching different constant values at \u00b1\u221e that recently drew renewed interest (see e.g. the recent Egorova et al [12] and Girotti et al [27] and the extensive literature cited therein). We start out from the Riemann-Hilbert version of the binary Darboux transformation put forward in our recent [50] and show that our construction is not really restricted to isolated negative eigenvalues and can be readily extended to the negative spectrum of arbitrary nature that step-type potentials can produce. As is well-known, Darboux transformations are particularly convenient in studying soliton propagation over various backgrounds and it is reasonable to expect that our approach can be used to the same effect for whole intervals of continuous negative spectrum. This becomes particularly relevant in the light of the recent spike of interest to soliton gases (see section 4).\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we outline our notational agreements. In Section 3 we go over some basics necessary to fix our notation and terminology as well as some of our previous results needed in what follows. Section 4 is devoted to the statement and discussions of our main result, Theorem 4.1. In Section 5 we rewrite the classical formulation of the Riemann-Hilbert problem approach to the KdV equation in the form convenient for our generalizations. In Section 6 we state our Riemann-Hilbert problem with a jump matrix which entries are distributions. In Section 7 we state and prove a Riemann-Hilbert version\n1E.g. the book [31] pays much of attention to binary Darboux transformations but double commutation is not mentioned. The recent [52] briefly mentiones [31] and [25] but without discussing connections.\nof the continuous binary Darboux transformation. Theorem 7.1 proven therein is essentially equivalent to Theorem 4.1 but we hope it may present an independent interest, especially to the reader who prefers the Riemann-Hilbert problem framework. Section 8 is auxiliary and devoted to discretization of our main integral operator which our limiting arguments are based on. Section 9 is another auxiliary section where a convenient formula is derived for the proof of the main theorem. In Section 10 we finally prove Theorem 4.1 which essentially amounts to combining the ingredients prepared in the previous sections. In Section 11 we consider explicit examples. The first one is a new derivation of the well-known formula for pure soliton solutions and the second one is an explicit construction of reflectionless step-type potential. Appendix is devoted to some more auxiliary statements."

Prime \u2032 means the derivative (perhaps generalized) in the main variable (typically spatial or in spectral parameter). The temporal variable t appears only as a parameter and is frequently suppressed. W{f, g} = fg\u2032 \u2212 f \u2032g is the Wronskian with obvious interpretation if one of f is a vector.\nGiven a non-negative finite Borel measure \u00b5 on the real line, L2 (d\u00b5) is the real Hilbert space with the inner product \u3008f, g\u3009 = \u222b f (x) g (x)d\u00b5 (x), where the integral is taken over the support Supp\u00b5. In particular, d\u00b5 =dx, the Lebesgue measure on the whole real line, then we conveniently abbreviate L2 (dx) = L2. We apply the same agreement to other Lebesgue spaces Lp.

The same convention is used for LpN (\u00b1\u221e).

For the reader\u2019s convenience and to fix our notation we review the necessary material following [1, 42, 46]. The IST method consists, as the standard Fourier transform method, of three steps:\nStep 1. (direct transform) q (x) \u2212\u2192 Sq,\nwhere Sq is a new set of variables which turns (3.1) into a simple first order linear ODE for Sq(t) with the initial condition Sq(0) = Sq.\nStep 2.

Suppose that the initial condition q for (3.2) is real and rapidly decaying. This means that the solution q (x, t) to (3.1)-(3.2) is subject to the decay condition\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n(1 + |x|) |q (x, t)| dx <\u221e, t \u2265 0, (short-range). (3.3)\nAssociate with q (x) the full line Schro\u0308dinger operator Lq = \u2212\u22022x + q (x). (For simplicity we retain the same notation for the differential operation.) Its spectrum SpecLq consists of a two fold absolutely continuous part filling [0,\u221e) and finitely many negative simple eigenvalues (bound states) ( \u2212\u03ba2n )N n=1 . An important feature of the short-range q is that it supports two (right/left) Jost solutions \u03c8\u00b1(x, k). I.e. solutions of the Schro\u0308dinger equation\nLqu = \u2212u\u2032\u2032 + q (x) u = k2u, (3.4) having plane wave asymptotics at infinity: \u03c8\u00b1(x, k) \u223ce\u00b1ikx, x \u2192 \u00b1\u221e. Note that \u03c8\u00b1(x, k) are determined by q (x) on (\u00b1\u221e, x) respectively. These solutions are analytic for Im k > 0, continuous down to the real line where \u03c8\u00b1(x,\u2212k) = \u03c8\u00b1(x, k). The pair {\u03c8+, \u03c8+} forms a fundamental set for (3.4) and hence\nT (k)\u03c8\u2212(x, k) = \u03c8+(x, k) +R(k)\u03c8+(x, k), k \u2208 R, (3.5) with some T and R called the transmission and (right) reflection coefficients respectively. While totally elementary, (3.5), called the right basic scattering identity, serves as a foundation for inverse scattering theory. It immediately follows from (3.5) that\nT (k) = 2ik\nW {\u03c8\u2212 (x, k) , \u03c8+ (x, k)} , (3.6)\nwhich means that T (k) can be analytically continued into the upper half plane with simple poles at i\u03ban where \u03c8\u2212 (x, k), \u03c8+ (x, k) are linearly dependent. Moreover, \u03c8\u2212(x,i\u03ban), \u03c8+(x,i\u03ban) are real and decay exponentially at both \u00b1\u221e and hence \u2212\u03ba2n is a (negative) bound state (eigenvalue) of Lq . The number\ncn = (\u222b \u03c8+(x, i\u03ban) 2dx )\u22121/2 (3.7)\nis called the norming constant of the bound state \u2212\u03ba2n. The reflection coefficient R (k) is continuous but need not analytically extend outside the real line. It obeys R (\u2212k) = R (k), |R (k)| \u2264 1, |R (k)| = 1 only at k = 0. The main feature of the short-range case is that R (k) (continuous component) and {(\u03ban, cn), 1 \u2264 n \u2264 N} (discrete component) determine the potential q uniquely. It will be convenient for our purposes to write the discrete component as the (discrete) measure\nd\u03c1 (k) =\nN\u2211\nn=1\nc2n\u03b4\u03ban (k) dk, (3.8)\nwhich alone carries over all necessary information about the discrete spectrum. We can now introduce the (right) scattering data\nSq := {R, d\u03c1}. We emphasize that Sq determines q uniquely (i.e. Sq is indeed data) in general only for short-range q\u2019s. (See e.g. our recent [51] for explicit counterexamples.)\nStep 2. The main reason why the IST works is that the (necessarily unique) solution q (x, t) to the problem (3.1)-(3.3) gives rise to the \u201dtime evolved\u201d Schro\u0308dinger operator Lq(\u00b7,t) for which\nR (k, t) = R (k) e8ik 3t, \u03ban (t) = \u03ban, cn (t) = e 4\u03ba3ntcn.\nSince q (x, t) is short-range for t > 0\nSq (t) = { R (k) e8ik 3t, e8k 3td\u03c1 (k) : k \u2265 0 }\nis (\u201dtime evolved\u201d) scattering data for q (x, t). Step 3. Solve the inverse scattering problem for Sq (t) by any applicable method. Note that this scheme runs for the left scattering data equally well. Another remarkable feature of the classical short-range IST is that potentials subject to (3.3) can be characterized in term of the scattering data (known as Marchenko\u2019s characterization [42]).\n3.2. One sided IST. The IST was extended in [32] and [54] to step-like initial data q, i.e. q\u2019s approaching two different values as x \u2192 \u00b1\u221e rapidly enough (aka an initial hydraulic jump or bore wave) or and then to q\u2019s approaching periodic function on one end and a constant on another in [33]. The main difference from the short-range case is that the measure \u03c1 in the scattering data gains an absolutely continuous component and the right and left ISTs are different. In fact, [32] uses the left IST and [54] does the right IST to prove that the absolutely continuous component of \u03c1 gives rise to an infinite sequence of asymptotic solitons twice as high as the initial hydraulic jump. The latter is the main feature of such initial profiles. Another interesting feature of step-like initial data is appearance of rarefaction waves studied recently in [12] and [27].\nIn [29] we extended IST to initial data that approach zero at +\u221e fast enough but are essentially arbitrary at \u2212\u221e. As opposed to the step-like data studied in [32, 54] such potentials support in general only the right inverse scattering. The approach is based on the notion of a Weyl solution. Recall that a real-valued locally integrable potential q is said to be Weyl limit point at \u00b1\u221e if the equation Lqu = k2u has a unique (up to a multiplicative constant) solution (called Weyl) \u03a8\u00b1(\u00b7, k2) that is square integrable at \u00b1\u221e for each k2 \u2208 C+. Note that as apposed to Jost solutions, Weyl solutions exist under much more general conditions on q\u2019s and no decay of any kind is required. As is well-known, if q (x) is limit point at both \u00b1\u221e then Lq is selfadjoint on L2.\nIt is convenient to give a special name to potentials that we shall deal with through the rest of the paper.\nDefinition 3.1 (Step-type potentials). We call a (real) potential q (x) step-type if\n(1) q (x) \u2208 L11 (+\u221e) (short-range at +\u221e); (2) SpecLq > \u2212\u221e (essential boundedness below).\nThe (right-sided) scattering theorem for such potentials is studied in our [28, Section 7] where the interested reader can finds the details. Choose the Weyl solution \u03d5 (x, k) (note our variable k not k2) at \u2212\u221e to satisfy\n\u03d5 (x, k) = \u03c8(x, k) + R(k)\u03c8(x, k), a.e. Im k = 0, (3.9)\nwith some coefficient R (k) (c.f. (3.5)), which can be called the (right) reflection coefficient. Note that in the short-range case\n\u03d5 (x, k) = T (k)\u03c8\u2212(x, k). (3.10)\nProposition 3.2 (On reflection coefficient). The (right) reflection coefficient R of a step-type potential q (x) is well defined, symmetric R (\u2212k) = R (k), and |R (k)| \u2264 1 a.e. Moreover, if \u2206 \u2286 Spec (Lq) is the minimal support of the two fold a.c. spectrum of Lq then |R (k)| < 1 for a.e. real k such that k2 \u2208 \u2206 and |R(k)| = 1 otherwise.\nThis statement describes the positive spectrum of Lq only. The negative spectrum is described in\nProposition 3.3 (On norming measure). If q (x) is step-type then on the imaginary line \u03d5 and \u03c8 are related by2\nIm\u03d5 (x, ik + 0) dk = \u03c0\u03c8 (x, ik) d\u03c1 (k) , k \u2265 0, (3.11) for some non-negative finite measure \u03c1. Moreover,\nSupp \u03c1 = { k \u2265 0 : \u2212k2 \u2208 Spec (Lq) } .\nProposition 3.2 is proven in [28, Proposition 7.10]. Proposition 3.3 follows from Proposition 7.12 of [28, Section 7] (but it shall also become transparent from considerations below). Note that \u03c8 (x, k) is analytic for Im k > 0 and \u03d5 (x, t) is analytic for Im k > 0 away from i Supp \u03c1. If q is short-range then d\u03c1 in (3.11) coincides with (3.8) (see below). For this reason we call \u03c1 the norming measure. Note that the important in the short-range scattering representation (3.10) defining the transmission coefficient T (k) is lost for a generic step-type potential. It can of course be introduced, as frequently done in the literature on bore-type q\u2019s discussed above,\n2Here and below, as always, Im f (x+ i0) dx = w\u2217 \u2212 lim Im f (x+ iy) dx, y \u2192 +0.\nby replacing the left Jost solution in (3.10) with another Weyl solution which asymptotic in x \u2192 \u2212\u221e is know for a.e. real k. But the transmission coefficient introduced this way will depend on such choice. We refer the interested reader to [26] for a general framework on scattering theory with different spatial asymptotics at \u00b1\u221e. For our purposes we do not need the transmission coefficient but it may become necessary to study asymptotic behavior of KdV solutions as x\u2192 \u2212\u221e.\nIf q(x) is a pure step function, i.e. q(x) = \u2212h2, x < 0, q(x) = 0, x \u2265 0 then Spec (Lq) = (\u2212h2,\u221e) and purely absolute continuous, (\u2212h2, 0) and (0,\u221e) being its simple and two fold components respectively. Moreover\nR(k) = \u2212 (\nh\u221a k2 + \u221a k2 + h2\n)2 , d\u03c1 (k) = 2k\n\u03c0h2\n\u221a h2 \u2212 k2dk. (3.12)\nLet us now look at what happens to Step 1- Step 3 (the \u201dtime evolved\u201d picture). Using the classical short-range IST as a pattern to follow, introduce\nSq = {R (k) , d\u03c1 (k) : k \u2265 0} for Step 1. The problem though is that no analog of Marchenko\u2019s characterization is known to date and, while Sq can be formed by solving right sided scattering problem we cannot claim that there is only one q that corresponds to Sq. But we move on to Step 2 and form\nSq (t) = { R (k) e8ik 3t, e8k 3td\u03c1 (k) : k \u2265 0 } .\nThis step is formal as there are no general well-posedness results for the KdV equation with general step-type initial data. Thus we don\u2019t know what Sq (t) actually represents and cannot go over to step 3. These problems can however be detoured by understanding a KdV solution as a suitable limit. The following definition is convenient for this. It is also quite natural from the physical point of view.\nDefinition 3.4 (Step-type KdV solutions). We call q (x, t) a (right) step-type KdV solution with scattering data Sq = {R (k) , d\u03c1 (k) : k \u2265 0} if for t \u2265 0\n(1) q (x, t) is step-type (in the sense of Definition 3.1); (2) there is a sequence Sn = {Rn, d\u03c1n} such that each set Sn is the scattering\ndata for some short-range (real) potential qn (x) and in the weak* sense\nSn \u2192 Sq qn (x, t) \u2192 q (x, t) , (double convergence), (3.13)\nwhere qn (x, t) is the KdV solution with initial data qn (x).\nThe comments below should clarify the nature of this concept and why it could be convenient.\n1. We emphasize again that no well-posedness for step-type KdV solutions is available in general. The main issue is that it is not clear what Banach space such solutions can be included to even speak about well-posedness. For bore-type initial conditions the best known well-posedness result in given in the recent [36] (see also [38]). These papers also suggest that well-posedness for (3.1)-(3.2) for general step-type q\u2019s may be out of reach.\n2. In [5] the authors use certain IST constructions to give examples of nonuniqueness of the Cauchy problem for KdV. One example gives a nontrivial C\u221e solution q (x, t) in a domain {(x, t) : 0 < t < H(x)} for a positive nondecreasing function H , such that q (x, t) vanishes to all orders as t \u2192 0. This solution decays rapidly\nas x \u2192 +\u221e, but cannot be \u201dwell behaved\u201d as x moves left. Further analysis is required to tell if such q (x, t) may in fact be a step-type potential3 or not but these disturbing examples suggest that condition 2 may indeed be needed to single out a solution that we think of as physically relevant.\n3. In a more restrictive form, Definition 3.1 appears first in our [49] (where it is referred to as natural). The problem (3.1)-(3.2) with q (x) subject to\nSpecLq > \u2212\u221e, (3.14) q (x) \u2208 L1N (+\u221e) <\u221e, N \u2265 5/2, (3.15)\nis studied in our [28, 29]. It is shown that the sequence qn (x, t) of KdV solutions corresponding to cut-off approximations qn (x) = q (x)\u03c7(\u2212n,\u221e) (x) of initial data q (x) converges to a classical solution q (x, t) of (3.1) (that is three times continuously differentiable in x and once in t) uniformly on compacts in R\u00d7 R+. (That is, convergence qn(x, t) \u2192 q (x, t) in (3.13) is actually much better than weak*.) The sequence of scattering data Sn, however, converges in the weak* sense and no better. Recall that, as is well-known [9], even in the short-range case cut-off approximations lead to the sequence Rn (k) that fails to converge uniformly\n4 to R (k) at k = 0. Thus, under conditions (3.14) and (3.15) the double convergence (3.13) works as follows: (n \u2192 \u221e)\nqn(x) = q (x)\u03c7(\u2212n,\u221e) (x) \u2192 q (x) a.e. (3.16)\n\u21d2 Sn \u2192 Sq star-weakly qn (x, t) \u2192 q (x, t) locally uniformly for t > 0 .\nThat is, we start out from short-range (cut-off) approximations qn (x) that produce a sequence of scattering data Sn required in condition 2, which weak* limit, in turn, corresponds to q (x, t) = lim qn (x, t). Note again that even though a solution q (x, t) is in a way natural (as it comes from cut off approximations) but we have no ground to believe that there are no \u201dspurious\u201d solutions. For this reason Sq may be referred to as scattering data only for solutions which we call natural.\n4. Since the KdV flow is isospectral (already assumed in the Lax pair formulation of the KdV equation), condition (3.14) holds for t > 0. Condition (3.15) is however not time invariant. Technics of [29] can be readily used to tell how the rate of decay at +\u221e drops under the KdV flow (in fact, to tell how the KdV trades decay at +\u221e for gain in smoothness (work in progress)). [5] suggests that if q (x) \u2208 L1N (+\u221e), then q (x, t) \u2208 L1N\u22125/4 (+\u221e) \u2208 L11 (+\u221e) and hence q (x, t) \u2208 L11 (+\u221e) when N \u2265 5/2.\n5. The chain (3.16) is not always convenient. The one\nSn \u2192 S a.e. \u21d2 qn(x, t) \u2192 q (x, t) a.e. for t \u2265 0 (3.17) may, as our [51] suggests. Below we have to implement both (3.16) and (3.17) in (3.13). This should explain the meaning of condition 2.\n6. The weak* convergence of qn(x, t) \u2192 q (x, t) in (3.13) is assumed to be on the save side and may be upgraded. The real upgrade though would of course be indicating a Banach space where it takes place. The latter does not appear possible\n3Explicit IST constructions given in [2] produce double pole singularity moving left and thus such solutions fail condition 1 of Definition 3.4.\n4See also [48] which results shed some light on reasons why only a weak convergence is to be expected.\nunless we impose strong assumptions on the behavior of q (x) as x \u2192 \u2212\u221e. E.g. [29] if\n\u221e\u2211\nm=\u2212\u221e\n(\u222b m+1\nm\n|q (x)| dx )2 <\u221e, (3.18)\nthen qn(x, t) \u2192 q (x, t) holds at least in the Sobolev space H\u22121 (R). The latter is a direct consequence of well-posedness of the KdV in H\u22121 recently proven in [34]. (In fact, any H\u2212\u03b5 with 0 < \u03b5 \u2264 1 will do.)\n7. Condition (3.14) is satisfied if\nSup |I|=1\n\u222b\nI\nmax (\u2212q (x) , 0) dx <\u221e. (3.19)\nThe latter covers a large class of initial profiles without any assumption on a pattern of behavior at \u2212\u221e."

Theorem 4.1 is an extension of Theorem 1 of our recent [50] where all considerations are conducted in the short-range setting. It was observed in [50] (Remark 3) that only the right Jost solution \u03c8 explicitly appears and the left Jost solution does not explicitly appear in any formulas. This led us to conjecture that q may be quite general at \u2212\u221e. Theorem 4.1 answers this conjecture in the affirmative. The relaxation of the decay assumption at \u2212\u221e results in the appearance of rich negative spectrum described by a measure \u03c1 of arbitrary nature (in the short-range case it is discrete with finitely many pure points). To remain in the short-range setting we could consider in [50] perturbations \u03c3 supported only at finitely many points. In Theorem 4.1 we no longer have to assume this and moreover \u03c3 can be continuous. For this reason Theorem 4.1 can also be named the continuous binary Darboux transformation or the continuous analog of the double commutation method [25]. Note that the formula (4.6) appears to be new even in this case when \u03c3 is discrete with finitely many points (c.f. [25, 50]). Furthermore, binary Darboux transformations are typically written differently for adding and removing eigenvalues and thus Theorem 4.1 combines the two.\n2. The main feature of the transformation (4.6) is that it allows us to modify the negative spectrum in a nearly unrestricted way while leaving the reflection coefficient unchanged.\n3. Since \u03c8 (\u00b7, is) is real, if d\u03c3 \u2265 0 then the kernel K (\u03b1, s;x, t) is positive definite and (4.4) is automatically uniquely solvable. However, if d\u03c3 < 0 then this is no longer true in general. A counterexample is easily produced by R = 0, \u03c1 = 0, and d\u03c3 (k) = \u2212c2\u03b4 (k \u2212 \u03ba)dk, \u03ba > 0. Indeed a simple formal computation gives then\nq\u03c3 (x, t) = \u22122\u22022x log ( 1\u2212 c2e8\u03ba3t\u22122\u03bax ) ,\nwhich is a singular KdV solution (has moving real double pole). Thus the second condition (4.3) cannot be dropped. In other words, removing an inexistent eigenvalue produces a singular solution. Note that this way our approach offers a setting for generating singular solutions on nonzero backgrounds. It would be interesting to compare our method to Wronskian considerations commonly used in the this context (see, e.g. the influential [41]).\n4. The first condition (4.3) guarantees that 0 is not an eigenvalue of q\u03c3. If 0 were an eigenvalue then q\u03c3 would not be short-range at +\u221e. We believe it can be relaxed to read that \u03c3 is a Carleson measure (see, e.g. for the definition [35]) but cannot be completely removed.\n5. Equations (4.5) and (4.7) give an explicit formula for reconstruction of the Jost solution \u03c8\u03c3 (x, t; k) for any Im k \u2265 0 via its values on Supp \u03c3. Note that there is no such formula for a generic analytic function.\n6. Step-type potentials admit embedded discrete negative spectrum. Note that there are no positive embedded bound states if q is short-range at +\u221e.\n7. The formula (4.6) can also be written as\nq\u03c3 (x, t) = q (x, t) \u2212 2\u22022x log det [I +K (x, t)] , where K (x, t) is a trace class integral operator acting by the formula\nK (x, t) f =\n\u222b [\u222b \u221e\nx\n\u03c8 (z, t; i\u03b1)\u03c8 (z, t; is) dz ] f (s) d\u03c3t (s) .\n8. As we have mentioned, it is proven in [32, 54] that a short-range perturbation of a pure step function, i.e. q(x) = \u2212h2, x < 0, q(x) = 0, x \u2265 0 (hydraulic jump) gives rise to an infinite sequence of asymptotic solitons of height \u22122h2 (twice as high as the initial hydraulic jump). Theorem 4.1 suggests that this effect is a much more general phenomenon and the fastest soliton always propagates with the asymptotic velocity 2h2 where h2 = \u2212 inf SpecLq. Computing asymptotic phases is the most difficult part. (Work in progress).\n9. As one of our referees drew our attention to, if q = 0 our (4.6) produces a notion of generalized reflectionless potentials that is reminiscent of the construction due to Lundina [40] and Marchenko [43]. More specifically, it is proven in [43] that if the integral equation\ne\u22124\u03ba 3t+\u03bax { a (\u03ba) y (\u03ba)\u2212 1\n2\u03ba\n[\u222b y (s)\u2212 y (\u03ba) s\u2212 \u03ba d\u03c3 (s)\u2212 1 ]}\n= e4\u03ba 3t\u2212\u03bax { [a (\u03ba)\u2212 1] y (\u2212\u03ba)\u2212 1\n2\u03ba\n[\u222b y (s)\u2212 y (\u2212\u03ba)\ns+ \u03ba d\u03c3 (s)\u2212 1\n]} (4.8)\nis uniquely solvable for y (\u03ba, x, t), then\nq (x, t) = \u22122\u2202x \u222b y (\u03ba, x, t) d\u03c3 (\u03ba) (4.9)\nsatisfies the KdV equation with data q (x, 0) = q (x), a and \u03c3 being related to q (x). It is not obvious how (4.8) and (4.9) are related to (4.4) and (12.1), respectively, but it would certainly be an interesting question to ask (especially because an open question related to the measure \u03c3 is stated in [43]). Note that, as apposed to our (4.4), solubility of (4.8) is not on the surface. Finally, we also mention that our methods are very different from [43], where smoothness of q (x) is essential, while it is not in our construction.\n10. And last but not least, we discuss the relevance of Theorem 4.1 to soliton gases. Back in 1971, Zakharov [55] pioneered a statistical description of multisoliton solutions (rarefied soliton gas) which became a big deal in this millennium after the introduction of integrable turbulence and general framework for random solutions of integrable PDEs in his influential [57]. This phenomenon was observed in shallow water wind waves in Currituck Sound, NC [7] and was experimentally reproduced in a water tank [47] and optical fibers, drawing even greater interest in a number of research groups (see e.g. [6, 10, 14, 16, 27, 45]) with different approaches. Dense soliton gas and condensate, particular important from the physical view point, can be modelled as a closure of pure soliton solutions (c.f. [10, 13, 21, 17, 18]). We mention only [10] where the Zakharov-Manakov dressing method [56] was used to yield primitive potentials, which are one-gap but neither periodic nor decaying. Such solutions are parametrized by dressing functions r1, r2 and essentially only\nr2 = 0 has been studied rigorously [27] via RHP technics. For r2 6= 0 the only case of r1 = r2 was just considered in [45] (elliptic one-gap potential if r1 = r2 = 1) but the general case is still out of reach. Note that the dressing method isn\u2019t quite IST and cannot solve a Cauchy problem [43]. While seemingly unrelated, Theorem 4.1 may put many KdV soliton gas considerations in the context of the IST for the Cauchy problem for the KdV equation and provide a rigorous framework to study soliton gases. In fact, in the soliton gas community they actually study statistical quantities (density of states, effective velocity, collision rate, etc.) of our left step-type KdV solutions from Theorem 4.1 with q (x, t) = 0 (zero background) and specific a.c. d\u03c3 \u2265 0 supported on [ \u2212b2,\u2212a2 ] with a > 0. Inclusion of q (x, t) 6= 0 (nonzero backgrounds) and a = 0 (small solitons) into the picture are good open problems. Another open problem comes from some numerics suggesting that \u201dinjection\u201d of a soliton into soliton condensates may locally in time and space \u201devaporate\u201d the latter but this effect is not described mathematically. We are yet to look into these questions but at least Theorem 4.1 eases our concern about rather formal realization of limiting (scaling) arguments quite common in the physical literature on the subject."

Since I is arbitrary, it follows from (5.7) that\nIm\u03d5 (is\u2212 0) ds = \u2212\u03c0\u03c8 (is) d\u03c1 (s)\n5It is more common to set v(k) \u223c ( 1 , 1 ) , k \u2192 \u221e, to remove oscillations but then the\njump matrix gains an undesirable dependence on x.\nand, since Im\u03c8 (is\u2212 0) = 0 (\u03c8 is analytic away from R), we can rewrite now the pole conditions (5.3) as\nImv (is\u2212 0) =\n \n\nv (is+ 0)\n( 0 0\n\u2212\u03c0\u03c7+ (s) d\u03c1 (|s|) /ds 0\n) , s > 0\n\u2212v (is+ 0) ( 0 \u2212\u03c0\u03c7\u2212 (s) d\u03c1 (|s|) /ds 0 0 ) , s < 0\n(5.10)\n= v (is+ 0)\n( 0 \u22122i\u03c0\u03c7\u2212 (s) d\u03c1 (|s|) /ds\n\u22122i\u03c0\u03c7+ (s) d\u03c1 (|s|) /ds 0\n) ,\nwhere the derivatives are understood in the sense of distributions and, as always, \u03c7\u00b1 is the characteristic function of R\u00b1.\nSince 2i Imv (is\u2212 0) = v (is\u2212 0) \u2212 v (is\u2212 0) = v (is\u2212 0) \u2212 v (is+ 0), (5.10) yields\nv (is\u2212 0) = v (is+ 0) (\n1 \u22122i\u03c0\u03c7\u2212 (s) \u03b4 (s) \u22122i\u03c0\u03c7+ (s) \u03b4 (s) 1\n) , (5.11)\nwhere\n\u03b4 (s) := sgn (s) \u2211\nn\nc2n (t) \u03b4\u03ban (|s|) . (5.12)\nObserve that we have reformulated the pole conditions (5.3) as a jump condition (5.11) across the imaginary line, the negative spectrum data being encoded in (5.12). Note that the jump matrix in (5.11) is not a continuous function but a distribution. The main advantage of (5.11) over (5.3) is that it readily yields a generalization to an arbitrary negative spectrum once we allow \u03b4 to be the distributional derivative of an arbitrary positive finite measure. This will be done in Section 7."

            "text": "In this section we introduce a jump matrix with singular entries that plays the central role in our considerations.\nLet \u03a3 be a contour consisting of three lines: the real line R oriented from left to right, the part of the imaginary line iR+ in the upper half-plane oriented upwards, and the part of the imaginary line \u2212iR\u2212 in the lower half-plane oriented downwards. Apparently, \u03a3 divides the complex plane into quadrants. Given a function f (k) analytic on C \\ \u03a3, call such functions quadrant analytic6, we denote by f\u00b1 (k) nontangentional boundary values of f from the positive/negative (\u00b1) side of \u03a3. Here the positive/negative side is the one that lies to the left/right from \u03a3 as we traverse the contour in the direction of orientation.\nLet R (k) be as in Proposition 3.2\nR(k, t) = R(k)e8ik 3t,\n\u03c1 (k) a nonnegative finite measure on R+ and \u03b4 (k, t) =e 4k3td\u03c1 (k) /dk (generalized density).\n6In fact, f may be analytic on some sets of the imaginary line. In particular, may be analytic on both C\u00b1.\nQuadrant analytic vector Riemann-Hilbert problem (QARHP) Let J (k, t) be a 2\u00d7 2 matrix-valued function defined on \u03a3 as follows\nJ (k, t) = { JR (k, t) , Im k = 0 J\u03c1 (k, t) , Re k = 0 , (6.1)\nwhere\nJR (k, t) :=\n( 1\u2212 |R(k, t)|2 \u2212R(k, t)\nR(k, t) 1\n) , k \u2208 R,\nJ\u03c1 (k, t) :=\n( 1 \u22122i\u03c0\u03c7\u2212 (s) \u03b4 (s, t)\n\u22122i\u03c0\u03c7+ (s) \u03b4 (s, t) 1\n) , k = is, s \u2208 R.\nFind a row function v = ( \u03d5 , \u03c8 ) analytic in each quadrant such that:\n(1) Symmetry conditions:\nv(k) = v(\u2212k) = v(k) ( 0 1 1 0 ) . (6.2)\n(2) Jump condition: at least in the sense of distributions\nv+(k) = v\u2212(k)J(k, t), for k \u2208 \u03a3. (6.3) Remark 6.1. (1) We stated our QARHP in abstract terms but it, of course,\ncomes from the Riemann-Hilbert formulation of the IST for the KdV equation. Thus, each component of v = ( \u03d5 , \u03c8 ) solves the Schro\u0308dinger equation (and hence depends on the spatial variable x) and the jump matrix J (k, t) depends on t (time) as it takes into account the time evolution of scattering data. Therefore, v (k) everywhere below depends on (x, t) as parameters (and consequently many other quantities) but we agree to suppress this dependence when it causes no confusion. (2) We do not assume that v\u00b1 are continuous (which is typically assumed). Since J is a distribution one then may reasonably ask (as one of the referees did) \u201dWhat does it mean to multiply a distribution by a merely almosteverywhere defined function?\u201d We see no way such multiplication can be well-defined but there is no reason for that in our situation. Indeed, while for a generic pair of solutions \u03d5, \u03c8 to the Schro\u0308dinger equation condition 2 need not be satisfied in any sense, in the context of (right) step-type potentials there is no problem with (6.3). To explain this let us examine JR and J\u03c1. Since JR is in L\n\u221e there is no problem on R. On \u03a3 R =iR the jump matrix J\u03c1 has indeed distributional off diagonal entries but once we rewrite (6.3) as (s \u2265 0)\n( \u03d5 (is\u2212 0) , \u03c8 (is\u2212 0) ) = ( \u03d5 (is+ 0)\u2212 2i\u03c0\u03b4 (s, t)\u03c8 (is+ 0) , \u03c8 (is+ 0) ) ,\none immediately sees that if \u03c8 is the right Jost solution (necessarily analytic for Im k > 0 with continuous boundary values and hence \u03c8 (is\u2212 0) = \u03c8 (is+ 0) = \u03c8 (is) is smooth) the product \u03b4 (s, t)\u03c8 (is) is then a distribution7 for s \u2265 0. Due to symmetry (6.2) this also holds for s < 0. Thus the bad situation when condition 2 is ill-posed (for nontrivial v) may not materialize for the type of problems we are concerned in this paper.\n7Or even a function if the measure \u03c1 is an a.c.\n(3) The asymptotic condition (5.4) imposes [30] the following condition on J\nJ(\u2212k, t) = ( 0 1 1 0 ) J(k, t)\u22121 ( 0 1 1 0 ) ,\nwhich our J clearly obeys. (4) The asymptotic condition (5.4) is clearly missing which results in non-\nuniqueness. Indeed, a scalar multiple of a solution satisfies conditions (6.2) and (6.3). In our setting it is more convenient to restore uniqueness by imposing a slightly different from (5.4) condition.\nThe following proposition is easy but crucial to our considerations. Since the variables (x, t) appear in the QARHP as parameters we leave them out.\nProposition 6.2 (Gauge transformation). If v (k) is a solution of QARHP and \u00b5 is any finite (signed) symmetric measure, then\nv\u0303 (k) = v (k) +\n\u222b W {v (k, \u00b7) , \u03c8 (\u00b7, is)}\nk2 + s2 d\u00b5 (s) , k /\u2208 \u03a3, (6.4)\nsatisfies the symmetry condition (6.2) and\nv\u0303+(k) = v\u0303\u2212(k)JR(k, t) Im k = 0 (jump across the real line),\nbut not across the imaginary line.\nProof. Check the symmetry conditions (6.2):\nv\u0303(k) = v(k) +\n\u222b W { v(k), \u03c8 }\nk2 + s2 d\u00b5\n= v(\u2212k) + \u222b W {v(\u2212k), \u03c8}\nk2 + s2 d\u00b5 = v\u0303(\u2212k)\n= v(k) ( 0 1 1 0 ) +\n\u222b W { v(k) ( 0 1 1 0 ) , \u03c8 }\nk2 + s2 d\u00b5\n= v\u0303(k) ( 0 1 1 0 )\nand both symmetry conditions follow. Check the jump across condition (6.3) across the real line. Suppressing the variables, we have\nv\u0303+ = v+ + \u222b W {v+, \u03c8} k2 + s2 d\u00b5 = v\u2212 (k)JR + \u222b W {v\u2212JR, \u03c8} k2 + s2 d\u00b5\n= ( v\u2212 + \u222b W {v\u2212, \u03c8} k2 + s2 d\u00b5 ) JR=v\u0303\u2212JR\nand the jump condition follows.\nProposition 6.2 says that the transformation v+ \u2192 v\u0303+ preserves the jump condition across the real line but not across the imaginary line. By choosing \u00b5 we will be able to modify the jump matrix J\u03c1 in (6.1) in nearly unrestricted way (without altering the reflection coefficient)."

            "text": "In this section we state and prove a Riemann-Hilbert version of the continuous binary Darboux transformation. It is of course directly related to Theorem 4.1 but we hope it deserves special attention. Through this section all statements and proofs admit time dependent situation but since t appears as just a parameter we drop it from the list of variables emphasizing that the material of this section need not be considered in the KdV context.\nTheorem 7.1 (Continuous Darboux transformation). Let q (x) be a step-type potential, \u03c8 (x, k) a right Jost solution, and for all real x\nv (x, k)= ( \u03d5 (x, k) , \u03c8 (x, k) )\nsolve the QARHP with the jump matrix ( JR,J\u03c1 ) given by (6.1). Let \u03c3 be a (signed) finite measure supported on R+ such that the Fredholm integral equation\ny (\u03b1, x) + \u222b K (\u03b1, s, x) y (s, x) d\u03c3 (s) = \u03c8 (x, i\u03b1) , \u03b1 \u2208 Supp\u03c3, (7.1)\nwith the kernel\nK (\u03b1, s, x) =\n\u222b \u221e\nx\n\u03c8 (z, i\u03b1)\u03c8 (z, is) dz\nhas a unique solution in L2 (d\u03c3).

Moreover \u03c8\u0303 (x, k) is the right Jost solution corresponding to the potential\nq\u0303 (x, t) = q (x, t) (7.3)\n+ 2 [\u222b \u03c8\u0303 (x; is)\u03c8 (x, is) d\u03c3 (s) ]2 + 4 \u222b \u03c8\u0303 (x, is)\u03c8\u2032 (x, is) d\u03c3 (s) ,\nand\n\u03c8\u0303 (x, i\u03b1) = y (\u03b1, x) , \u03b1 \u2208 Supp \u03c3. (7.4)\nNote that the requirement that \u03c8 is a Jost solution plays the role of the normalization condition missing in the QARHP. We also observe that since the Jost solution is real for Re k = 0, the right hand side of (7.3) is also real. And finally it is worth mentioning that Condition (6.1) implies that on the real line \u03d5 (x, k) and \u03c8 (x, k) are related by the basic scattering identity (3.9) and thus \u03d5 (x, k) is unique for a given the latter \u03c8 (x, k).\nProof. Consider the gauge transform (6.4). By Proposition 6.2 the reflection coefficient R is then preserved and it remains to find a measure d\u00b5 (s, x) in (6.4) that produces the desirable jump matrix across the imaginary line. Due to the symmetry condition (6.2) we can assume that Im k > 0. For the time being we suppress the dependence on x whenever it leads to no confusion.\nRewriting (6.4) component-wise we have\n\u03d5\u0303 (k) = \u03d5 (k) +\n\u222b W {\u03d5 (k) , \u03c8 (is)}\nk2 + s2 d\u00b5 (s) , (7.5)\n\u03c8\u0303 (k) = \u03c8 (k) +\n\u222b W {\u03c8 (k) , \u03c8 (is)}\nk2 + s2 d\u00b5 (s) . (7.6)\nSince the new pair ( \u03d5\u0303 , \u03c8\u0303 ) must satisfy the jump condition across iR, we have\n( \u03d5\u0303 (is\u2212 0) , \u03c8\u0303 (is\u2212 0) )\n= ( \u03d5\u0303 (is+ 0) , \u03c8\u0303 (is+ 0) )( 1 \u22122i\u03c0\u03c7\u2212 (s) \u03b4\u0303 (s) \u22122i\u03c0\u03c7+ (s) \u03b4\u0303 (s) 1 ) ,\nwhere \u03b4\u0303 (s) is the density of the perturbed measure \u03c1\u0303 = \u03c1 + \u03c3, we conclude that\n\u03c8\u0303 (k) is analytic for Im k > 0 and\nIm \u03c8\u0303 (i\u03b1\u2212 0) = 0, Im \u03d5\u0303 (i\u03b1\u2212 0) = \u2212\u03c0\u03b4\u0303 (\u03b1) \u03c8\u0303 (i\u03b1) .

It follows from (6.3) that\n\u03d5 (k + i0) = \u03c8 (k + i0) + R (k)\u03c8 (k + i0)\nand hence, since \u03c8 is the right Jost solution,\nW {\u03d5 (k + i0) , \u03c8 (k + i0)} =W { \u03c8 (k + i0), \u03c8 (k + i0) } = 2ik.\nThus W {\u03d5 (k) , \u03c8 (k)} = 2ik also for Im k > 0 and in particular W {Re\u03d5 (i\u03b1\u2212 0) , \u03c8 (i\u03b1)} = ReW {\u03d5 (i\u03b1\u2212 0) , \u03c8 (i\u03b1)} = \u22122\u03b1.\nIt follow then that in the sense of distributions\nI2 = \u2212\u03c0\u00b5\u2032 (\u03b1) . (7.14) Substituting (7.12) and (7.14) into (7.7) yields\nIm \u03d5\u0303 (i\u03b1\u2212 0) = Im\u03d5 (i\u03b1\u2212 0) + I1 + I2\n= \u2212\u03b4 (\u03b1)\u03c8 (i\u03b1) + \u03c0\u03b4 (\u03b1) \u222b K (\u03b1, s) d\u00b5 (s)\u2212 \u03c0\u00b5\u2032 (\u03b1)\n= \u2212\u03c0\u03b4\u0303 (\u03b1) \u03c8\u0303 (i\u03b1) . Here we have taken (7.8) into account. It follows that\n\u03b4 (\u03b1) [ \u03c8 (i\u03b1)\u2212 \u222b K (\u03b1, s) d\u00b5 (s) ] + \u00b5\u2032 (\u03b1) = \u03b4\u0303 (\u03b1) \u03c8\u0303 (i\u03b1) . (7.15)\nEvaluate now \u03c8\u0303 (i\u03b1). From (7.6) and (7.11) we see that\n\u03c8\u0303 (k) = \u03c8 (k) +\n\u222b W {\u03c8 (k) , \u03c8 (is)}\nk2 + s2 d\u00b5 (s)\n= \u03c8 (k)\u2212 \u222b K (\u03b1, s) d\u00b5 (s)\nand hence\n\u03c8\u0303 (i\u03b1) = \u03c8 (i\u03b1)\u2212 \u222b K (\u03b1, s) d\u00b5 (s) . (7.16)\nSubstituting this into (7.15) one immediately obtains\n\u03b4 (\u03b1) [ \u03c8 (i\u03b1)\u2212 \u222b K (\u03b1, s) d\u00b5 (s) ] + \u00b5\u2032 (\u03b1)\n= \u03b4\u0303 (\u03b1) { \u03c8 (i\u03b1)\u2212 \u222b K (\u03b1, s) d\u00b5 (s) } ,\nwhich, recalling that \u03c3 = \u03c1\u0303\u2212 \u03c1, can be rearranged as\n\u03c3\u2032 (\u03b1) { \u03c8 (i\u03b1)\u2212 \u222b K (\u03b1, s) d\u00b5 (s) } = \u00b5\u2032 (\u03b1) ,\nor in terms of measures{ \u03c8 (i\u03b1)\u2212 \u222b K (\u03b1, s) d\u00b5 (s) } d\u03c3 (s) = d\u00b5 (\u03b1) ,\nwhich is an integral equation on the measure \u00b5. Take d\u00b5 to be absolutely continuous with respect to the measure d\u03c3 and let y =d\u00b5/d\u03c3 be the Radon-Nikodym derivative. By the Radon-Nikodym theorem then\n\u03c8 (i\u03b1)\u2212 \u222b K (\u03b1, s) y (s) d\u03c3 (s) = y (\u03b1)\nand we finally have\ny (\u03b1, x) + \u222b K (\u03b1, s, x) y (s, x) d\u03c3 (s) = \u03c8 (x, i\u03b1) .\nThus we arrive at the Fredholm integral equation\ny +Ky = \u03c8, (7.17)\nwhere K is the integral operator with the kernel K (\u03b1, s;x) with respect to the measure \u03c3.\nIt remains to show (7.4). This immediately follows from (7.16) and (7.17). Indeed,\n\u03c8\u0303 (i\u03b1) = \u03c8 (i\u03b1)\u2212 \u222b K (\u03b1, s) d\u00b5 (s)\n= \u03c8 (i\u03b1)\u2212 \u222b K (\u03b1, s) y (s) d\u03c3 (s)\n= \u03c8 \u2212Ky = y.\nThe proof that \u03c8\u0303 is a right Jost solution and the representation (7.3) for q\u0303 will be given in Section 10."

Part 1 follows from [24, Theorem 4.1] where it is proven in the most general spectral situation and for arbitrary Sturm-Liouville operators but not in the IST context. Part 2 (removing eigenvalues) and 3 are not explicitly addressed therein but it can of course be done along the same lines readily suggested in [24]. For short-range q\u2019s both parts are proven in our [50] by completely different methods and in the IST context. The main difference in the approaches is that in [24] is obtained by adding one eigenvalue at a time while in [50] all eigenvalues are added simultaneously. The formulation of Proposition 10.1 is, however, new. Therefore we only show here that the operator I \u2212 K (x, t) is nonsingular (I + K (x, t) clearly is) and det {I \u2212K (x, t)} > 0 for all real x and t \u2265 0. To this end we observe that\ndet {I \u2212K (x, t)} = det { I \u2212C2 \u222b \u221e\nx\n\u03c8 (s, t) T \u03c8 (s, t) ds\n}\n= det { I \u2212 \u222b \u221e\nx\n(\u03c8 (s, t)C) T (\u03c8 (s, t)C) ds } ,\nwhere C = diag ( cne 4\u03ba3nt ) . Since ( cne 4\u03ba3nt\u03c8 (x, t, i\u03ban) )N n=1 is an orthonormal set in L2 it follows that\nI \u2212 \u222b \u221e\nx\n(\u03c8 (s, t)C)T (\u03c8 (s, t)C) ds =\n\u222b x\n\u2212\u221e\n(\u03c8 (s, t)C)T (\u03c8 (s, t)C) ds,\nwhich is clearly a positive definite matrix and the conclusion immediately follows.\nNote that Proposition 10.1 can actually be independently derived from [50, Theorem 3.1] by the following limiting arguments. Consider the sequence qn = q\u03c7(\u2212n,\u221e). As is proven in [28], Sqn \u2192 Sq weakly and the corresponding sequence qn (x, t) converges point-wise to some q (x, t) for every t > 0. An explicit formula for q (x, t) via Sq is given in [28] in terms of Hankel operators. The corresponding sequence \u03c8n (k;x, t) converges uniformly to \u03c8 (x, t; k) on compact in Im k > 0 (this is a general classical fact that holds even for Weyl solutions). Part 3 for qn follows directly from Marchenko\u2019s characterization of the inverse scattering problem for short-range potentials [42]. Indeed, his characterization of the scattering data Sq = {R, d\u03c1} imposes no other condition on d\u03c1 but N < \u221e. The passage to the limit as n \u2192 \u221e should then be in order.\nObserve that Proposition 10.1 is a particular case of Theorem 4.1. However an independent proof of Theorem 4.1 involves cumbersome technicalities which can be avoided by taking limits in already known results.\nWe now proceed to the proof of Theorem 4.1. As before, since (x, t) appear as parameters, we may drop them from the list of variable whenever it is convenient and leads to no confusion. We recall that prime stands for the derivative in x (no derivatives in other variable appear). It is sufficiently to show that Theorem 4.1 holds for Case 1: Sq = {R, 0}, d\u03c3 \u2265 0 and Case 2: Sq = {R, d\u03c1}, \u2212d\u03c3 \u2264 0 where d\u03c3 is a restriction of the (non-negative) measure d\u03c1, as the general case is a combination of the two. We concentrate on the proof for Case 1 since Case 2 relies on the very same arguments.\nCase 1 (adding negative spectrum). Discretize the measure d\u03c1 in (4.1) as is done in Section 8. More specifically, take\nd\u03c1N (k) =\nN\u2211\nn=1\n\u03c1 (In) \u03b4\u03ban (k) dk, N <\u221e,\nwhere the partition (In) is chosen the same way as in Section 8. Proposition 10.1, part 1, then applies with Sq = {R, 0}, d\u03c3 =d\u03c1N \u2265 0, and K = KN , where the entries are given by\n(KN )mn = \u03c1 (In) e 8\u03ba3nt\n\u222b \u221e\nx\n\u03c8 (s, t, i\u03bam)\u03c8 (s, t, i\u03ban) ds.\nThen q\u03c1N (x, t) = q (x, t) \u2212 2\u22022x log det {I +KN (x, t)} is a step-type KdV solution. By Proposition 9.1 we have\nq\u03c1N (x, t) = q (x, t) (10.5)\n+ 2 [\u222b \u03c8\u03c1N (x, t; is)\u03c8 (x, t; is) d\u03c1N (s) ]2\n+ 4 \u222b \u03c8\u03c1N (x, t; is)\u03c8 \u2032 (x, t; is) d\u03c1N (s) ,\nwhere\n\u03c8\u03c1N (x, t, k) = \u03c8 (x, t, k)\u2212 N\u2211\nn=1\n\u03c1 (In) e 8\u03ba3ntyn (x, t)\n\u222b \u221e\nx\n\u03c8 (s, t, k)\u03c8 (s, t, i\u03ban) ds,\n(10.6)\nand\n(yn) = (I +KN ) \u22121 \u03c8, \u03c8 := (\u03c8 (\u00b7, i\u03ban)) .\nNote that the integrals in (10.5) are actually finite sums. By Proposition 8.1 with g = \u03c8, S = (x,\u221e) we can pass in (10.5) and (10.6) to the limit as N \u2192 \u221e. Thus we have both, the weak convergence of {R, d\u03c1N} to {R, d\u03c1} and point-wise convergence of q\u03c1N (x, t) to q\u03c1 (x, t) = q (x, t) (10.7)\n+ 2 [\u222b \u03c8\u03c1 (x, t; is)\u03c8 (x, t; is) d\u03c1t (s) ]2 + 4 \u222b \u03c8\u03c1 (x, t; is)\u03c8 \u2032 (x, t; is) d\u03c1t (s) .\nBy Definition 3.4, q\u03c1 (x, t) is a step-type KdV solution, which proves (4.5) and (4.6) for Sq = {R, 0} and d\u03c3 =d\u03c1 \u2265 0 if we show that q\u03c1 (x, t) is short-range at +\u221e for each t \u2265 0. This will be done later. The solubility of the Fredholm integral equation (4.4), which we rewrite in the form\ny +Ky = \u03c8, (10.8)\nwhere K is the integral operator on L2 (d\u03c1) with the kernel\nK (\u03b1, s;x, t) :=\n\u222b \u221e\nx\n\u03c8 (z, t; i\u03b1)\u03c8 (z, t; is) dz,\nis obvious as K is clearly positive (see Section 8) and hence I+K is positive definite. Since the Hilbert-Schmidt norm ||K (x, t)||2 and the L2 norm ||\u03c8 (x, t; \u00b7)|| are small for large x and any fixed t \u2265 0, we immediately see from (10.8) that ||y (\u00b7, x, t)|| is also small as x\u2192 \u221e and (4.5) readily yields\n\u03c8\u03c1 (x, t; k) = \u03c8 (x, t; k) [1 + o (1)] \u2192 0, x\u2192 \u221e, Im k \u2265 0. (10.9) If we now show that \u03c8\u03c1 solves the the Schro\u0308dinger equation, it will be its right Jost solution. We rely on the following general fact (directly verifiable): if the Wronskian identity (7.9) holds for two functions f\u03bb (x), f\u03bd (x) then f \u2032\u2032 \u03bb (x) /f\u03bb (x) +\u03bb\n2 is independent of \u03bb and hence is equal to some q (x) . Thus, f\u03bb solves the Schro\u0308dinger equation \u2212f \u2032\u2032 + q (x) f = \u03bb2f .\nBy Proposition 10.1 \u03c8\u03c1N is a right Jost solution and hence is subject to (7.9). But as we have shown, \u03c8\u03c1N converges in L\n2 (d\u03c1) to some \u03c8\u03c1 and hence there is a subsequence convergent almost everywhere. It follows that we can pass in (7.9) to the limit and therefore \u03c8\u03c1 is a solution to the Schro\u0308dinger equation\n8. By Theorem 7.1, (7.4), we can claim that \u03c8\u03c1 (x, t; is) = y (s, x, t), s \u2208 Supp \u03c1, which also proves property (1). We are ready to show now that\nQ (x) := q\u03c1 (x, t)\u2212 q (x, t)\n= 2 [\u222b \u03c8\u03c1 (x, t; is)\u03c8 (x, t; is) d\u03c1t (s) ]2 + 4 \u222b \u03c8\u03c1 (x, t; is)\u03c8 \u2032 (x, t; is) d\u03c1t (s)\nis in L11 (+\u221e). This will conclude the proof that q\u03c1 is indeed a step-type KdV solution. But due to (10.9) Q \u2208 L11 (+\u221e) if\nQ0 (x) := 2 [\u222b \u03c8 (x, t; is)\u03c8 (x, t; is) d\u03c1t (s) ]2 + 4 \u222b \u03c8 (x, t; is)\u03c8\u2032 (x, t; is) d\u03c1t (s)\n8Note it can also be shown by a direct but rather involved inspection.\nis in L11 (+\u221e). The latter immediately follows from Lemma 12.2 as each term of Q0 is subject to its conditions.\nIt remains to prove the properties. (1) has already been proven. (2) clearly holds as each term in Q (x) is at least absolutely continuous. The same applies to the derivatives if q is differentiable sufficient number of times. (3) is also obvious since both \u03c8\u03c1 (x, t; is), \u03c8 (x, t; is) decay exponentially as x\u2192 \u221e for every s > 0. Thus if the sets Supp \u03c1 and {0} are separated then each term in Q (x) decay exponentially. To show (5) we recall the following general representation of the diagonal Green\u2019s function\nG ( k2, x ) =\nf+ (x, k) f\u2212 (x, k)\nW {f+ (x, k) , f\u2212 (x, k)} , (10.10)\nwhere f\u00b1 are Weyl solutions at \u00b1\u221e respectively. Take f\u00b1 as in Theorem 7.1: f+ = \u03c8, f\u2212 = \u03d5. Then (10.10) reads\nG ( k2, x ) = \u2212\u03d5 (x, k)\u03c8 (x, k)\n2ik . (10.11)\nAs is well-known, G (\u03bb, x) is a Herglotz function for each x, that is an analytic function from Im\u03bb > 0 into itself. Such functions may have singularities only on Im\u03bb = 0 of at most simple pole type. In the context of Schro\u0308dinger operators, a pole type singularity may only occur at a bound state. By Theorem 7.1 all pole type singularities on the right hand side of (10.11) come from singularities of \u03d5, which, in turn, coincide with pure points of \u03c1. This proves (4) and Case 1 is proven now.\nCase 2 (removing negative spectrum). Suppose that {R, d\u03c1} are scattering data for a step-type KdV solution and d\u03c3 = d\u03c1|\u2206, where \u2206 \u2286 Supp \u03c1. Let d\u03c3N be a discretization of d\u03c3 in Case 1. By Proposition 10.1 we construct a step-type KdV solution q\u2212\u03c3N by (10.3) and the associated Jost solution \u03c8\u2212\u03c3N by (10.4). As in Case 1, we can pass to the limit in Proposition 10.1 as d\u03c3N \u2192d\u03c3, the equations\n(\u03c8\u03c3)\u2212\u03c3 = \u03c8, (q\u03c3)\u2212\u03c3 = q\nbeing preserved in the limit. This completes our proof of Theorem 4.1. We are now in the position to complete the proof of Theorem 7.1. It is just\nenough to notice that \u03c8\u0303 and q\u0303 in Theorem 7.1 appear as \u03c8\u03c3 and q\u03c3 in Theorem 4.1.\nRemark 10.2. One of the referees asked if the process of adding negative spectrum is commutative. I.e. adding \u03c31 and then \u03c32 produces the same result as adding \u03c32 and then \u03c31. We are positive that this is indeed the case. Take in (10.1) two one point measures d\u03c3n (s) = c 2 n\u03b4 (s\u2212 \u03ban) ds, \u03ban > 0, n = 1, 2. We have two matrices K12 and K12\nK12 =\n\u222b \u221e\nx\n( c21\u03c8 (s, i\u03ba1) 2 c1c2\u03c8 (s, i\u03ba1)\u03c8 (s, i\u03ba2)\nc1c2\u03c8 (s, i\u03ba1)\u03c8 (s, i\u03ba2) c 2 2\u03c8 (s, i\u03ba2)\n2\n) ds,\n(adding \u03c31 and then \u03c32)\nK21 =\n\u222b \u221e\nx\n( c22\u03c8 (s, i\u03ba2) 2 c1c2\u03c8 (s, i\u03ba1)\u03c8 (s, i\u03ba2)\nc1c2\u03c8 (s, i\u03ba1)\u03c8 (s, t, i\u03ba2) c 2 1\u03c8 (s, t, i\u03ba1)\n2\n) ds.\n(adding \u03c32 and then \u03c31)\nSince (\nc22\u03c8 (s, i\u03ba2) 2\nc1c2\u03c8 (s, i\u03ba1)\u03c8 (s, i\u03ba2)\nc1c2\u03c8 (s, i\u03ba1)\u03c8 (s, t, i\u03ba2) c 2 1\u03c8 (s, t, i\u03ba1)\n2\n)\n= ( 0 1 1 0 )( c21\u03c8 (s, i\u03ba1) 2 c1c2\u03c8 (s, i\u03ba1)\u03c8 (s, i\u03ba2)\nc1c2\u03c8 (s, i\u03ba1)\u03c8 (s, t, i\u03ba2) c 2 2\u03c8 (s, i\u03ba2)\n2\n)( 0 1 1 0 ) ,\nwe conclude that\nK21 = ( 0 1 1 0 ) K12 ( 0 1 1 0 ) .\nHence det (I +K21) = det (I +K12) and therefore\nq\u03c31\u03c32 (x, t) = q (x, t)\u2212 2\u22022x log det {I +K12 (x, t)} = q (x, t)\u2212 2\u22022x log det {I +K21 (x, t)} = q\u03c32\u03c31 (x, t) .\nThis simple computation can be easily extended to two general discrete measures \u03c31, \u03c32 and then we apply our density argument to go over to arbitrary measures.\n11. Examples\nIn this section we offer two examples. The first one is a new derivation of the KdV solution and the other one is an explicit construction of a step-type potential (KdV solution) which has the same norming measure \u03c1 as the pure step potential (3.12) but zero reflection coefficient.\n11.1. Classical pure soliton solution. We show that Theorem 4.1 immediately recovers the well-known classical formula for pure N soliton solution [42]\nq (x, t) = \u22122\u22022x log det ( \u03b4mn + c 2 n e\u2212(\u03bam+\u03ban)x+8(\u03ba 3 m+\u03ba 3 n)t\n\u03bam + \u03ban\n) . (11.1)\nIndeed, take in Theorem 4.1 Sq = 0 (the zero background) and a discrete measure \u03c1 given by\nd\u03c1 (k, t) = N\u2211\nn=1\ncn (t) 2 \u03b4\u03ban (k) dk, cn (t) = cne 4\u03ba3nt\nIn this case \u03c8 (x, k) = exp (ikx) and the Fredholm integral equation (4.4) becomes a linear system,\nym + N\u2211\nn=1\nKmn (x, t) yn = e \u2212\u03bamx,\nwhere\nKmn (x, t) = c 2 ne\n8\u03ba3nt e\u2212(\u03bam+\u03ban)x\n\u03bam + \u03ban .\nFurthermore,\n\u03c8\u03c1 (x, t;\u03bam) = e \u2212\u03bamx \u2212\nN\u2211\nn=1\nc2ne 8\u03ba3nt\ne\u2212(\u03bam+\u03ban)x\n\u03bam + \u03ban yn (x, t) (11.2)\n= e\u2212\u03bamx [ 1\u2212 N\u2211\nn=1\nc2ne 8\u03ba3nt\u2212\u03banx\nyn (x, t) \u03bam + \u03ban\n]\nand thus for the KdV solution we have\nq\u03c1 (x, t) = 2\n[ N\u2211\nn=1\nc2ne 8\u03ba3nt\u2212\u03banx\u03c8\u03c1 (x, t;\u03ban)\n]2 (11.3)\n\u2212 4 N\u2211\nn=1\n\u03banc 2 ne 8\u03ba3nt\u2212\u03banx\u03c8\u03c1 (x, t;\u03ban) .\nThe formula (11.3) is a new derivation of (11.1). Due to (10.1), (11.3) is equivalent to (11.1). We note that the representation (11.1) is not as convenient for asymptotic analysis for large x and t as the methods based on the Riemann-Hilbert problem (see e.g. [30]). We are hopeful that for similar reasons (11.3) could be a suitable starting point to do asymptotic analysis that could work for arbitrary enough measures.\nWe conclude this section with a simple computation showing how (11.2) implies the famous one soliton solution. Taking in (11.2) \u03c1 (k) = c2\u03b4 (k \u2212 i\u03ba)\n\u03c8\u03c1 (x, t; i\u03ba) = e \u2212\u03bax 2\u03ba\n2\u03ba+ c2 exp (8\u03ba3t\u2212 2\u03bax)\nand substituting it in (11.3) implies\nq\u03c1 (x, t) = 2\n[ 2c2 exp ( 8\u03ba3t\u2212 2\u03bax )\n2\u03ba+ 2c2 exp (8\u03ba3t\u2212 2\u03bax)\n]2 \u2212 4\u03ba 2c 2 exp ( 8\u03ba3t\u2212 2\u03bax )\n2\u03ba+ 2c2 exp (8\u03ba3t\u2212 2\u03bax)\n= \u22122\u03ba2 sech2 ( 4\u03ba3t\u2212 \u03bax+ log c\u221a\n2\u03ba\n) ,\nwhich is the one soliton solution, as expected.\n11.2. Reflectionless step-type potential. As was discussed in section 4, such potentials naturally appear in the study of soliton gases. A pure step potential (3.12) serves as a model of soliton condensate but apparently it is not reflectionless. In this subsection we offer a construction that produces a step-type potential that has the same norming measure as a pure step potential but reflectionless. To this end, take in Theorem 4.1 Sq = 0 (the zero background) and the measure \u03c1 with\ndensity d\u03c1 (k) /dk = 2k \u221a 1\u2212 k2 supported on [0, 1]. Apparently, \u222b 1\n0\nd\u03c1 (k) /k <\u221e, d\u03c1 \u2265 0,\nand Theorem 4.1 applies. In this case \u03c8 (x, k) = exp (ikx) and\nK (k, is, x) = e(ik\u2212s)x\ns\u2212 ik ,\nare independent of t. Then the Fredholm integral equation (4.4) turns into\nY (\u03b1) +\n\u222b 1\n0\n2s \u221a 1\u2212 s2 e 8s3t\u22122sx\ns+ \u03b1 Y (s) ds = 1, \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1] , (11.4)\nwhere Y (s) = y (s)esx. Eq (11.4) has a unique solution Y (\u03b1;x, t) and for the potential we have\nq\u03c1 (x, t) = 8\n[\u222b 1\n0\ns \u221a 1\u2212 s2e\u22122sxY (s;x, t) ds ]2 (11.5)\n\u2212 8 \u222b 1\n0\ns2 \u221a 1\u2212 s2e\u22122sxY (s;x, t) ds,\nwhich is a reflectionless step-type KdV solution with the scattering data\nSq\u03c1 = {0, d\u03c1} . By Theorem 4.1 q\u03c1 (x, t) decays at +\u221e sufficiently fast but it cannot be readily seen how it behaves at \u2212\u221e. In fact q\u03c1 \u2192 \u22121 as x \u2192 \u2212\u221e. To show this one needs to perform a standard transformation of the QARHP in Theorem 7.1 (see e.g. [27]). We will come back to this elsewhere.\n12. Appendix\n12.1.

Auxiliary estimates for Jost solutions. Letm (x, k) =e\u2212ikxf (x, k), where f (x, k) is the right Jost solution.

Lemma 12.2. Let q \u2208 L11 (+\u221e) and f (x, is) =e\u2212sxm (x, is) , s \u2265 0, where m is subject to (12.1) and (12.2). Suppose that a finite measure \u03c3 supported on a finite subset of R+ satisfies \u222b\nd\u03c3 (s) /s <\u221e.\nThen\nF (x) := \u222b f (x, is) 2 d\u03c3 (s) \u2208 L1 (+\u221e)\nand F (x) 2 , F \u2032 (x) are both in L11 (+\u221e).\nProof. Without loss of generality we may assume that d\u03c3 \u2265 0. Observe that (12.1) and (12.2) imply m (x, k) = 1 + o (1), m\u2032 (x, k) = o (1/x) as x \u2192 \u221e uniformly in Im k \u2265 0. Therefore\nF (x) = \u222b e\u22122sxm (x, is) 2 d\u03c3 (s) = F0 (x) \u00b7 (1 + o (1)) , x\u2192 \u221e, (12.3)\nF \u2032 (x) = \u22122 \u222b e\u22122sxm (x, is) 2 sd\u03c3 (s) + 2 \u222b e\u22122sxm (x, is)m\u2032 (x, is) d\u03c3 (s) (12.4)\n= F \u20320 (x) \u00b7 (1 + o (1)) + F0 (x) \u00b7 o (1/x) , x\u2192 \u221e, where\nF0 (x) :=\n\u222b e\u22122sxd\u03c3 (s) .\nWe show first that F0 \u2208 L1 (+\u221e). For any finite a we have \u222b \u221e\na\nF0 (x) dx =\n\u222b [\u222b \u221e\na\ne\u22122sxdx ] d\u03c3 (s)\n= \u222b e\u22122as d\u03c3 (s)\n2s \u2264 max s\u2208Supp\u03c3 e\u22122as \u00b7\n\u222b d\u03c3 (s)\n2s <\u221e.\nSince Supp\u03c3 \u2282 R+ and \u03c3 is finite, it immediately follows that (1) F0 \u2208 L1 (+\u221e) and (2) in the computations below we can set for simplicity a = 0. Due to (12.3), we conclude that F \u2208 L1 (+\u221e). Let us show that F 2 \u2208 L11 (+\u221e). Indeed, due to (12.3) again, it is enough to show that F 20 \u2208 L11 (+\u221e):\u222b \u221e\n0\nxF 20 (x) dx \u2264 max x\u22650 [xF0 (x)]\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nF0 (x) dx <\u221e,\nas F0 is monotonic function from L 1 (+\u221e).\nWe now show that\nF \u20320 (x) = \u22122 \u222b e\u22122sxsd\u03c3 (s) \u2208 L11 (+\u221e) .\nIndeed, integrating by parts, one has \u222b \u221e\n0\nx |F \u20320 (x)| dx = 2 \u222b \u221e\n0\n[\u222b e\u22122sxsd\u03c3 (s) ] xdx\n= 2\n\u222b [\u222b \u221e\n0\ne\u22122sxxdx ] sd\u03c3 (s)\n= 2\n\u222b ( 1\n2s\n)2 sd\u03c3 (s) = \u222b d\u03c3 (s)\n2s <\u221e.\nTherefore, it follows from (12.4) that F \u20320 \u2208 L11 (+\u221e).\n13.
