    "abstractText": "Adolescence is a developmental stage with high risks in terms of psychological challenges and adjustments related to subjective well-being. Thus far, the findings reported a general decrease in school-related well-being over time. We considered well-being a multidimensional and latent construct that included both feeling good and functioning well at the individual level, and focused on the interplay between hedonic and eudemonic factors. Data of N = 377 high school students in Switzerland were used by conducting an online longitudinal study with two waves. Baseline data was gathered in autumn 2019 and the subsequent time point occurred 1 year later (2020; grades seven and eight). By applying a person-oriented analytical approach via latent class and latent transition analyses, we were able to identify and compare longitudinally three distinct well-being patterns and the respective trajectories. Regarding the distribution of the well-being patterns for both waves, significant changes over time were identified: particularly from wave 1 to wave 2, where there was an increase for the low and high well-being patterns, yet a decrease for the middle pattern. Comparing the stability of the respective patterns over time, the high well-being level showed the highest stability of all identified patterns. Multinomial logistic regression of covariates to the identified latent status membership established for both waves showed low but significant effects of socio-demographic variables. At wave 1, having a migration background was associated with a significant increase of being in a low versus high well-being level pattern. At wave 2, being female was associated with a significant increase of being in a low versus high and in a middle versus high well-being pattern.",

Particularly, the discussion on the relations between various well-being components is still ongoing [12], while acknowledging that adolescents experience lower levels of well-being than younger children or adults [1, 13]. As adolescent students\u2019 well-being is one of the most crucial predictors of adolescents\u2019 mental health [1, 4], and additionally because of adolescence itself as a psychologically risky developmental stage, adolescent students\u2019 wellbeing is considered the psychological cornerstone of a healthy transition from childhood to early adulthood [3, 8]. Especially during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been demonstrated that mental health status and the associated adolescent student\u2019s well-being requires close attention (74, 75).\nWell-being components of adolescents at school\nAs there is no common definition, we consider adolescent students\u2019 well-being a multidimensional and latent construct that includes aspects of adolescents feeling good (hedonic concept), the presence of positive and the absence of negative affect, and functioning well (eudemonic concept) at school [14, 15]. The variety of theoretical concepts and empirical measures on well-being impedes comparing studies [16]. Most definitions are based on describing the concept rather than its components [10], which makes it difficult to draw conclusions, run comparisons, and create broad interventions [17]. Even though policymakers and/or academics commonly use the term, it is still inconsistently defined [11]. Therefore, in what follows, we focus on hedonic and eudemonic theories in defining students\u2019 well-being at school.\nSpecifications on adolescent students\u2019 well-being. The two concepts, i.e., hedonic and eudemonic theories, are the backbone of understanding adolescent students\u2019 well-being [18] and have been empirically confirmed as distinct but still closely related theories [19] with long- and short-term benefits [20, 21]. Therefore, it is highly important for adolescent students\u2019 well-being to be conceptualized not only on the side of adolescents feeling good (hedonic concept), but also to perform and function well in academic contexts (eudemonic concept). Similar to adults, adolescent students\u2019 well-being refers to their life experiences because it is related to their social, emotional, cognitive, and academic performance\u2013being far more than just a general satisfaction with school grades [22]. Thus, the interrelations of external and internal factors regarding adolescent students\u2019 well-being play an essential role that goes far beyond a general well-being at school [23\u201325]. Therefore, hedonic and eudemonic well-being is expected to be correlated yet distinct aspects.\nThe hedonic aspect of well-being. The hedonic theories of well-being for adolescent stu-\ndents emphasize striving for positive experiences and consist of affective and cognitive components, such as higher levels of self-esteem and life satisfaction [23]. The association between self-esteem and well-being in adolescence is well documented [26]. High school students with a higher sense of self-esteem feel less threatened by school challenges [27] and develop through this process a sense of agency regarding their school behavior. The state of self-esteem being reported as an emotional hedonic component is among the most decisive determinants of well-being in adolescence [28\u201330]. The well-being of adolescent students is not only an extract of pleasant emotions at school but also relates to general life satisfaction [31], which is an essential cognitive hedonic component of well-being [32]. Life satisfaction relates to a broad conceptualization concerning adolescent students\u2019 assessment of their happiness with their lives as a whole [33, 34].\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0276794 December 1, 2022 2 / 20\nCompeting interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\nThe eudemonic aspect of well-being. Well-being at school goes beyond the experience of\nan individual\u2019s satisfaction. It also includes a eudemonic side, which embodies positive social skills promoting a person\u2019s positive functioning in their respective environment at school [14, 18, 35\u201337]. Dimensions are mastery at school, such as having good grades, high self-efficacy, and fulfilling basic psychological needs. The latter has its roots in Self-determination Theory, which includes positive relations with others, autonomy, and growth in academic competence as being essential to well-being at school [23, 38, 39]. Prominently, Deci and Ryan [38] have identified autonomy, experiences of being competent, and social relatedness as basic psychological needs. Deci and Ryan\u2019s self-determination theory of motivation focuses on these three primary psychological needs; the satisfaction of these needs represents a decisive requirement for intrinsic motivation. Coincidently, meeting basic psychological needs results in developing autonomy, competence, and social relatedness. The psychological need of competence is focused on reliable instrumentalities leading to specific outcomes [38, 40]. The need for autonomy focuses on adolescent students\u2019 aspirations to experience the self as the origin of their actions at school [23]. Adolescent students\u2019 need for social relatedness encompasses the universal urge to be connected, to interact with, and to experience interrelated caring during their studies. In general, adolescent students need to feel securely connected with and to feel understood by other people [40]. Because of these interrelations between internal and external school factors within the frame of the eudemonic concept, theoretical and empirical constructs such as self-determination [40], are considered crucial pillars of adolescent students\u2019 wellbeing [14].\nBandura [41] has defined perceived self-efficacy within the Social Cognitive Theory as a generalized concept of behavioral expectations based on mastery experience. According to Bandura [41], perceived self-efficacy is based on four sources of information: mastery experiences, vicarious experiences, verbal persuasion, and physical or affective states, whereby mastery experiences are assumed the most important. Bandura\u2019s [42] theory underlines that perceived self-efficacy influences both motivation and volition phases during the acting process. Consequently, adolescent students tend to set higher goals and be more efficient and realistic in planning their actions. Therefore, perceived self-efficacy enhances well-being [43]. Whereas Bandura [41, 42] described perceived self-efficacy as a domain-specific belief, Jerusalem and Schwarzer [44, 45] developed a scale for measuring general perceived self-efficacy as the universal belief for being able to cope with life challenges. This scale, as outlined in the current study, is more adequate if global concepts are predicted [46]. A higher level of perceived selfefficacy is considered favorable for setting and achieving goals and is relevant for autonomy and competence within the self-determination theory.\nStability of adolescent students\u2019 well-being. Although identifying adolescent students\u2019\nwell-being patterns at a given time is an important first step, knowing whether, why, and how these patterns change longitudinally is essential to design school-specific prevention and intervention programs. Research indicates that there is a decreasing-with-age tendency of wellbeing during adolescence [47, 48]. More recent studies verified this decreasing trend: For example, Casas and Gonza\u0301lez [48] found evidence for decreases in self-reported well-being during adolescence in a sample of N = 48,040 participants\u2013aged between 7 and 14 \u2013across 15 countries. They additionally argued that the respective results and the fluctuating scores differ significantly from country to country. Moreover, the authors presented evidence for a much earlier onset of the decreasing trend, showing that in most countries a well-being decrease starts at around 10 years of age. Findings of decreasing well-being have been also observed in another two-year follow-up study of adolescents, which was specifically focused on younger adolescents from ages 12 to 14 [49]. However, the findings of decrease were only reported for school-related well-being, whereas the well-being concerning health and friends remained\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0276794 December 1, 2022 3 / 20\nstable. In addition, Gonza\u0301lez-Carrasco et al. [7] also observed a significant decrease in wellbeing during adolescence using data from a sample of N = 940 Spanish students aged 9\u201316 (mainly 10\u201314). In contrast, there are also studies reporting mixed results with no changes within adolescence [e.g., 50, 51].\nConsequently, it is apparent that well-being development and the well-being rates throughout adolescence remain unclear across countries, especially also due to the fact that very different scales are used. Casas and Gonza\u0301lez [48] identified 13 different psychometric scales. In addition to the discussion concerning the conceptualization of well-being, there is still an unresolved question in terms of the well-being\u2019s stability throughout adolescence. Even though, there is evidence for both\u2014instability versus stability\u2014there is more evidence for instability, indicating a significant change across the childhood and adolescence period. To address this issue, this study aimed to examine the combined contribution of eudemonic and hedonic well-being factors in predicting subjective adolescent students\u2019 well-being patterns over time by applying Latent Transition Analysis (LTA). LTA is a longitudinal analysis technique which characterizes transitions over time [52]. Using this person-oriented procedure, we expect to estimate and understand the respective adolescent students\u2019 continuity of wellbeing levels at two time points, whether the transition is developmentally forward (e.g., transition to higher well-being levels) or backward (e.g., transition to lower well-being levels). This methodology allows grouping of subjects into distinct classes according to the adolescent students\u2019 well-being indicators included in the analysis, and then estimates the probability that a particular subject (thus also a person-oriented method) is a member of that class [52, 53].\nMoreover, we need to understand the interplay between covariates and well-being level pre-\ndictors to the respective well-being patterns and the potential changes. Research suggests that low socio-economic status [5] and migration background [54\u201357] predict adolescent students\u2019 well-being. The underlying assumption to this prediction is connected to the fact of a lower extent of available social and personal resources and to higher societal discrimination [5, 56, 57]. Additionally, female adolescent students show higher levels of internalizing symptoms than male students [57\u201359], which is associated with lower levels of well-being. Therefore, it is hypothesized that these socio-demographic factors might influence the membership in different groups that show each pattern of well-being and its stability and change one year later.\nIt is commonly hypothesized [47\u201349], but still not convincingly shown [50, 51], that well-\nbeing in early adolescence will drop over time. Thus, this study was conducted to fill these gaps in knowledge by discovering well-being patterns over time. Also, research suggests that female gender [55, 57] and a migration background [55\u201357] might mitigate membership in higher well-being patterns. In addition, school students enrolled in lower school level classes who are from families with a lower socio-economic background [5, 54] are expected to have a higher probability of membership in lower well-being patterns compared to students enrolled in higher school level classes who are from families with a higher socio-economic background."

Self-efficacy: The General Self-Efficacy Scale is a psychometric scale Schwarzer and Jerusalem [45] developed and is designed to assess optimistic self-belief regarding coping with various challenging demands in life (e.g., \u201cI am confident that I could deal efficiently with unexpected events\u201d). The 10-item scale (\u03b1_wave 2 = .89; \u03b1_wave 1 = .88) was measured on a four-point Likert scale (range: 1 = not true to 4 = completely true).\nSelf-determination: Following Deci and Ryan\u2019s [38, 39] Self-Determination Theory (SDT)\non human basic psychological needs, we measured the three subscales autonomy, competence, and relatedness on short scales with three items each (e.g., \u201cI was free to do things in my own way\u201d). The nine-item scale (\u03b1_wave 2 = .79; \u03b1_wave 1 = .78) was measured on a four-point Likert scale (range: 1 = not true at all to 4 = completely true).\nSatisfaction with grades at school: Satisfaction with grades at school is a single-item indica-\ntor addressing the individual student\u2019s assessment of their grades and was measured on a fourpoint Likert scale (range: 1 = not at all satisfied to 4 = completely satisfied). Predictors. Gender. Students\u2019 gender was assessed with three response options (0 = male, 1 = female). Socio-economic status (SES).

Primarily, the information of T0 data was used, and in cases of missing values, wave 1 data was also considered. In addition, if there still was missing information concerning the parental education, more information was gathered from the student questionnaire\u2019s item \u201cWhat is the highest completed qualification or school education of your parents?\u201d (which was assessed for each parent separately, in cases of differing qualifications the highest one was selected).\nMigration background. Not having a migration background means the student and both of their parents were born in Switzerland and all three possess only the Swiss nationality. Having a migration background is operationalized such that one or more of the aforementioned conditions do not apply (0 = no migration background, 1 = with migration background).\nSchool level. In Switzerland, adolescents in high schools are divided based on performance and teacher recommendations on mainly three school levels (lower, higher secondary school level, and Gymnasium).

Due to this, the two samples are comparable.\nAnalytic step two: Identifying well-being patterns separately for wave 1 and for wave 2 by LCA\nIn step two, we identified adolescent students\u2019 well-being patterns by computing two separate LCAs (LCA for wave 1 and for wave 2) using six classification variables. A separate set of LCAs for each wave were performed to determine the optimal number of classes at each time point. The 377 individual cases from wave 1 and the 319 cases from wave 2 were assigned separately to a group based on their response similarity in the measured six indicators. Thus, individuals in each group shared the same pattern of well-being [52]. The LCA was conducted for a range\nof two to five latent classes. The main aim was to determine significantly distinct well-being classes.\nThe estimated models were non-nested models; therefore, the procedures chosen for model selection were the sample-adjusted Bayesian information criterion (aBIC) indicating goodness of fit. A lower value indicated a more appropriate fit, and entropy [53] indicated the certainty in the estimation, with values above 0.7 considered sufficient [63, 64]. However, the final model for an LCA (i.e., how many classes) was chosen based on a mix of statistical indicators and extant theoretical considerations [53]. We applied different criteria for the model selection. First, the entropy value indicated the certainty in the estimation with values above 0.7 considered sufficient [64]. Second, with information criteria, such as Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and Sample-Adjusted BIC (ABIC), with the smaller values fitting the model better [64]. For the LCA, we additionally applied model fit criteria as the Vuong-Lo-Mendell-Rubin Likelihood Ration test (LMR-LRT), the Lo-MendellRubin Adjusted Likelihood Ratio test (aLMR-LRT), and the Bootstrapped Likelihood Ratio test (BLRT) with significant p-values indicating an improvement to the previous model with k-1 classes [64].\nBased on the six indicators (life satisfaction, self-efficacy, self-esteem, self-determination,\nwell-being, and satisfaction with grades at school), a series of LCAs was applied to group students into empirically distinct well-being classes. For wave 1, the aBIC scores dropped between the two and three class solutions and the still-significant tests (VLMR, aLMR, and the bootstrap likelihood ratio test (BLRT)) indicated an improvement supporting a three over two classes solution. Between classes three and four there was a aBIC rise (\u0394BIC = 3), and all three performed tests (VLMR, aLMR, and BLRT) indicated no improvement between class three to class four solution. Therefore, a three classes solution was selected for wave 1 (see Fig 1).\nFor wave 2, the differences between the aBIC scores for the two, three, four, and five class\nsolutions were small, which suggested weak evidence [63] for a higher class-number solution. The highest drop supporting the elbow effect between the classes was noticed between the class two to class three solution (\u0394aBIC = 23).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0276794.g001\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0276794 December 1, 2022 8 / 20\nsolution when related to the respective adjusted BIC drops. Given the above-reported criteria and the rule of deference to more constrained and parsimonious models [64], the three-class solution also was selected for wave 2 (see Table 3). Model fit statistics to select the number of classes of well-being at school are also displayed in Table 3.\nRegarding the distribution of the six indicators on the three identified classes for both\nwaves (see Fig 2), we identified vast similarities: A low (wave 1 = 24.1%; wave 2 = 35.5%), a middle (wave 1 = 46.91%; wave 2 = 31.0%), and a high level (wave 1 = 28.9%; wave 2 = 33.4%) well-being class at both time points was detected. The indicators\u2019 probabilities (see Fig 2) on the respective levels are highly comparable on all six indicators, supporting the chosen classes solution for both waves. For both waves the students\u2019 immense well-being differences when comparing the respective low- to the high-level patterns has been identified. For example, see the category 2 (high level of the respective indicator) probabilities comparison of the six indicators (see Fig 2), especially the results on the self-esteem of low well-being patterns for wave 1 and wave 2 (both 0%) and high well-being patterns for wave 1 (96.4%) and wave 2 (93.6%). Likewise, the results are indicative on self-determination: low well-being pattern for wave 1 (0%) and wave 2 (1.4%) and high well-being patterns for wave 1 and wave 2 (both 90%).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0276794.g002\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0276794 December 1, 2022 9 / 20\nBased on the identified three well-being patterns for both waves, we tested for measurement\ninvariance [64] across time in the number of well-being patterns (configural invariance) that could be analyzed for wave 1 and wave 2. Additionally, it was tested whether the loadings on the respective latent classes were invariant, thus ensuring that the factors\u2019 structures, that is, the three well-being patterns, were the same for both study waves (metric invariance). When testing for metric measurement invariance, we identified a nonsignificant chi-square difference test (\u0394chi2 [18] = 27.62, p> 0.05.), thereby establishing the same relevance for the three well-being patterns for both study waves. Ensuring metric invariance was the first approach necessary for comparing the three well-being patterns over time.\nTo summarize the invariance testing results, we found the same number of well-being patterns and well-being dimensions present across both waves over a one-year period. This indicates that the three introduced and empirically analyzed well-being patterns provided an empirically reliable measure over time.\nHaving established this structure similarity for both waves, the third analysis step on testing\nstability and change among different patterns of well-being by applying LTA can be approached.\nAnalytic step three: LTA to indicate significant differences in the longitudinal classification variables\nIn step three, an LTA was applied to indicate significant differences in the longitudinal classification variables on the identified well-being patterns. LTA, the longitudinal extension of LCA, is a statistical tool that can fulfill the needs of modeling adolescent well-being transitions over time [64]. It can estimate the continuity of well-being at adjacent time points, whether the transition is forward (e.g., transition from a lower well-being pattern to a higher) or backward (e.g., from a higher well-being pattern to a lower). After determining the optimal number of classes separately at each time point to be three (see analysis step two), we performed an LTA to estimate the probabilities of well-being pattern changes over time from one latent class to another [64]. In this statistical step, change is represented by the probability of transitioning to a latent well-being status at wave 2, given latent status membership at wave 1 [64]. Also, it explores whether the same latent status can be identified in both wave 1 and wave 2 [64].\nWe ran an LTA by using the previously mentioned six classification variables (for model fits see Table 4). The LTA was conducted for a range of two to five latent classes to test if the conditional response probabilities had been constrained to be time-invariant.\nThe elbow profile plot on the sample-adjusted aBIC and on the Akaike information crite-\nrion (AIC) when testing for two to five profiles (see Fig 2) indicates by both information criteria a three classes solution. The detected samples for the respective solutions (see Table 5) support this with the four class and five class solutions having numerous sub-samples with far too few (< n = 20) allocated students to the respective sub-samples (four classes solution with\nNote. AIC = Akaike information criterion; aBIC = adjusted Bayesian information criterion\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0276794.t004\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0276794 December 1, 2022 10 / 20\n50% and five classes solution with 80% of the sub-samples having less than n = 20 students). Due to this and the rule of deference to more constrained and parsimonious models, a threeclass solution was selected for the longitudinal comparison via LTA.\nRegarding the distribution of the three classes for both waves (see Table 5) we identified significant changes over time, particularly an increase in the low well-being pattern (of 7.1% from wave 1 to wave 2), a decrease in the middle pattern (of 15.6% from wave 1 to wave 2), and an increase in the high well-being pattern (of 8.5% from wave 1 to wave 2).\nIn terms of comparing the respective groups\u2019 stability over time, a heterogeneous picture\ncan be identified (see Fig 3) as just 39.6% (n = 69) of the students who were in the middle wellbeing class at wave 1 were still in the middle well-being class at wave 2. In comparison, 54.4% (n = 49) of the students who were in the low well-being class at wave 1 were still in the low well-being class at wave 2. Further, 67.3% (n = 76) of the students who were in the high wellbeing class at wave 1 were still in the high well-being class at wave 2, showing the highest stability of all identified patterns.\nThe students at wave 2 of the low well-being level at wave 1 mostly transitioned to the mid-\ndle (32.2%) (n = 29) and just 13.3% (n = 12) to the higher well-being level (see Fig 3). The probability of a downward transitioning from the middle well-being at wave 1 to a low pattern at wave 2 was 27.6% (n = 48) and the forward transition to the high well-being level at wave 2 was 32.8% (n = 57). Interestingly, within the studied one-year time period and the comparison made from grade seven to grade eight, the backward transition from the high-level pattern at"

Our analysis included socio-demographical covariates for both waves that could plausibly relate to well-being pattern variations at school (see Table 6): Gender, migration background, socioeconomic status, and school level were included as socio-demographic predictors to the identified latent status membership.\nThe socio-demographic variables showed for both waves (see Table 6) a very low prediction\nto the respective identified LCA patterns even if the explained variance for wave 1 was lower (wave 1 Cox and Snell = 3.7%) than for wave 2 (wave 2 Cox and Snell = 7.3%). At wave 1, having a migration background was associated with a significant and strong increase in the relative log odds of being in a low versus high well-being level pattern. This holds similarly for the relative log odds of being in a low versus middle well-being level pattern (see Table 6).\nAt wave 2, it was especially gender, not migration background as for wave 1 (see Table 6)\nthat effected the highest prediction to the respective well-being patterns (see Table 6). At wave\n2, being female was associated with a significant increase in the relative log odds of being in a low versus high and in a middle versus high well-being level pattern.

            "text": "Because latent class analysis (LCA) and LTA are exploratory and not confirmatory methods, we will address the findings with the needed containment. Using longitudinal questionnaire data from adolescents in Switzerland, analyses on adolescents\u2019 school-related well-being and the respective changes in well-being during early adolescence were presented to understand possible changes over time. Following the most recent insights [13, 15, 26, 33, 48], we considered well-being a multidimensional construct that included both feeling good (hedonic concept) while performing academically positively and functioning well (eudemonic concept) at the individual level. Therefore, latent well-being patterns of adolescents at school were analyzed consisting of multiple indicators and their relations within the well-being classes as a latent construct.\nTherefore, this study aimed to examine subjective adolescent students\u2019 well-being patterns\nlongitudinally by applying LCA and LTA. Using a multifaceted procedure, we expected to estimate the continuity of well-being levels and to explore whether transitions were to higher or lower well-being levels.\nBy applying six well-being indicators (life satisfaction, self-efficacy, self-esteem, self-deter-\nmination, well-being, and satisfaction with grades at school), first a consecutive series of LCAs was applied to group students into empirically distinct well-being classes for the two study waves. For both waves, a three classes solution (low, middle, and high well-being pattern) was selected as to best fit the data. These analyses were crucial, as adolescence is a developmental stage with high risks in terms of psychological problems and adjustments related to subjective well-being [13] and significant decreases are assumed across the period of adolescence [47, 48]. The applied invariance analysis ensured both reliability for the identified number of wellbeing patterns (configural invariance), and established, as one of few studies so far, for both waves the same relevance of the three introduced well-being patterns (metric invariance) while ensuring structural and factorial comparability across both waves over a one-year period in early adolescence.\nTo model adolescent well-being transitions over time and following the methodological\nsuggestions of Collins and Lanza [52], we identified significant differences in the longitudinal classification variables on the three well-being patterns (low, middle, and high level) via LTA. Considerable increases for the low well-being pattern and for the high well-being pattern were noticed, but a very high decrease of the middle pattern. Interestingly, and contrary to other studies often reported [47, 48, 49], we detected, based on these three well-being patterns, a very heterogeneous transition over time, although not a general decline on well-being over time for all adolescents. A striking stability (over 2/3) from wave 1 to wave 2 was identified for students showing a high well-being pattern. This contrasted the lower stability levels of the middle pattern with just about 40% over time. Regrettably, also the stability of the low wellbeing pattern was quite high over time with almost more than half of the students still being on the low well-being pattern. Thus, these results contribute to the debate on the decreasingwith-age issue: presumably, the assumption that all adolescents experience a decrease in wellbeing is not justified. It is possible that the inconsistent results and discrepancies in previous\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0276794 December 1, 2022 13 / 20\nstudies\u2019 statements concerning the stability of the well-being in adolescence are due to not only methodological and contextual differences [18], but also the variance of developmental trajectories within a population of adolescents. It is conceivable that this decreasing trend only occurs in certain adolescent populations, e.g., only in the case of a confluence of unfavorable contextual factors, or that this trend begins at different set-points. As Casas et al. [48] have already shown with their analyses using different international samples, this trend may also have different set-points. Our participants were slightly older than 12 years old at the beginning of the study. Considering Casas et al.\u2019s [48] results, indicating that the decreasing trend in most international samples occurred between the ages of 10 and 12, it cannot be excluded that this decreasing trend started before the age of 12 in some adolescent subgroups. Therefore, this may account for the discrepancy with other studies assuming a decreasing-with-age tendency.\nBecause well-being in adolescence is considered the backbone of mental health [33, 66\u201368],\nit is essential to understand how the dynamics of transitions over time have to be conceptualized and to which student groups the respective down- or upwards transitions apply. Therefore, for both waves we included socio-demographical covariates, such as gender, migration background, socio-economic status, and school level, that could plausibly relate to the wellbeing pattern variations at school and identified just a very low prediction to the respective identified patterns with the respective prediction for wave 1 being even lower than for wave 2. At wave 1, having a migration background was associated with a significant increase of being in a low versus high well-being level pattern. At wave 2, it was especially gender, not migration background, that showed the highest prediction to the respective well-being patterns. Contrary to Arpino and de Valk\u2019s [69] or Safi\u2019s [70] studies that found differences in reported subjective well-being between students with or without migration background, our results for early adolescents in Switzerland indicated no such important differences.\nAt wave 2, being female was associated with a highly significant increase of being in a low\nversus high and in a middle versus high well-being pattern. Gender, in the classical heteronormative dichotomy of being female or male, was not that distinctive as other studies suggested for well-being [7, 18, 71] or mental health in early adolescence [26, 28, 29, 56, 66]. Additionally, having a higher socio-economic status was associated at wave 2 with a higher probability of being in a higher well-being pattern.\nThe specific modeling of the calculations, as the way social reality is analyzed, has a distinc-\ntive role in the respective results in terms of mental health [10, 20, 66, 67]. Therefore, in further analyses in terms of identified well-being patterns, gender and other socio-demographical variables should be also considered [4]. Our latent models and identifying latent well-being patterns may be useful as an empirical basis for planning international explorations.\nWell-being patterns in Swiss schools over time were identified. Well-being in adolescence\nalso has to be addressed country specific and internationally [26, 59, 72] to develop international educational policies. Differences in adolescents\u2019 lives are diverse and based on the respective culture [24, 49, 54, 55, 73].\nAlthough we made a first step in assessing well-being data longitudinally, we are still cau-\ntious stating causal relations or even arguing about the overall phase of adolescence\u2013as the two waves are only one year apart. As we measured at the beginning of each new school year, we do not know how the respective seasons might impact adolescent students\u2019 reports of well-being. So far, there is no empirical evidence internationally of how these patterns could be different if assessed at additional timepoint in the middle of the respective school year. In middle and late adolescence, students\u2019 well-being patterns could change over time, which does not just refer to the respective well-being levels [11], but also content wise to the indicators of which well-being consists of [3, 10].\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0276794 December 1, 2022 14 / 20\nFuture research could run further analyses including aspects of resilience and mental health issues as indicators. Especially, when the question of fostering personal growth, school motivation and academic achievement, not just identifying, positive well-being development is the desideratum, promoting processes like supportive resilience factors and the role of specific mental health issues had to be further investigated and connected to the identified well-being classes. Furthermore, it would also be possible to test a similar model across three or more time points and test whether the predictors change over a longer period.\nLastly, it is also important to note that these findings should be considered within the\ncontext of COVID-19 because the data of wave 2 were collected in the later stages of the first COVID-19 wave. Researchers assessing survey data from the earlier stages of the first COVID-19 wave have pointed to an apparent increase in the frequency and severity of mental illness symptoms and a decline in psychological well-being for adolescents [74\u201376]. However, the results of some meta-analyses showed that the psychological impact of COVID-19 and its further consequences were small in magnitude [77\u201379]. More specific, the findings confirmed that the declines in psychological well-being and mental health were most pronounced during the pandemic\u2019s early stages. Studies from the later stages of the first COVID-19 wave indicated a normalization in mental health conditions and an attainment of pre-pandemic levels [80]. Indeed, additional analyses conducted with the purpose of examining the changes in mental health outcomes using the same sample as the current study [78, 79] also revealed that the expected negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health symptoms was not noticeable in the later stages of the first COVID-19 wave. Thus, we assume the initial increase in problems to be related to mental health and well-being reported at the onset of the pandemic may have not persisted in later stages of the first COVID-19 wave [81, 82]. Therefore, we believe our conclusions will hold true beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, even when being cautious because we still do not know how many COVID-19 waves are yet to come."

The attrition of about 18% between wave 1 and 2 was, considering the ongoing Covid-pandemic, low. Even though attrition for gender and migration-background was tested and no significant differences were found, we remain cautious on the two tested samples.\nWe did not account for the nested structure of the data (students embedded in 33 classes)\nas we chose a traditional LTA as a research method. Even more sophisticated research methods could be informative for reviewing the present findings. Additionally, because of the sample sizes (at wave 2 n = 319), the proportion of students in each class (six to 15 students), and the number of classes (33 classes) we did not run multilevel or similar analyses referring to classspecific results. For future research we suggest working with bigger sub-samples (about 450 students each wave) and from about 40 classes, to run multilevel analyses. Following Maas & Hox [83] and Akter & Khan [84], sampling for multilevel analysis is a challenging endeavour: Only bigger samples from at least 40 classes with at least 10 students in each class ensured robustness. Even if newer studies [85] comply with using smaller samples in multilevel analysis under certain conditions, the robustness is not considered as a given.\nThe results of our two-wave longitudinal analyzes will have to be verified as for full longitu-\ndinal analyzes at least three waves are needed [86].\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0276794 December 1, 2022 15 / 20\nWell-being is context-dependent and because of that, analyzes must be made context spe-\ncific. Analyzes on adolescent students\u2019 well-being were at the center of this study. This needed focus is also a limitation to the possibility of comparing well-being scores of different studies.\nWe used adolescents\u2019 self-perceptions by the applied students\u2019 questionnaires to understand\ntheir well-being at school. It would have been interesting to add teachers\u2019 perceptions of the respective students because relations to teachers play a distinct role in adolescent students\u2019 well-being [72]. The respective quality of the relationship between teachers and students, specifically teachers\u2019 perceptions, expectations, and behaviors in the context of teaching and communication with their students are important predictors of students\u2019 academic, personal, and social development [54].\nWithin this study, we could not test for a cut-off score of well-being. Due to this, it was not\npossible to test for the critical assumption that there might be an optimal, but not a maximal, level of well-being for the respective school classes."

Therefore, adolescents particularly on the low and middle well-being level need specific attention to support upward transitions to higher well-being level patterns and to mitigate downward transitions.
