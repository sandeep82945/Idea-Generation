            "text": "RNAs, once thought of as an intermediate in the flow of genetic information from DNA to proteins, are now credited with playing a central role in many cellular functions [1\u20134]. As a result, RNAs have increasingly become the target of structural and therapeutic efforts [5\u20137]. Among the different techniques available to study RNA, nuclear magnetic\nresonance (NMR) spectroscopy is particularly useful [8, 9]. NMR, unlike X-ray crystallography, permits the study of RNA structure and dynamics in solution on a wide-range of timescales spanning picoseconds-to-seconds [10]. Nevertheless, poor chemical shift dispersion and broad linewidths limit the broad application of NMR to understand the structure and dynamics of RNA [11].\nSeveral technological advances have begun to address these problems: use of cryogenic probes, higher magnetic field spectrometers, and the design of multidimensional NMR experiments [12\u201317]. Even with these innovations, spectral crowding and signal overlap still limit the effective analysis of large (> 30\u00a0nucleotide, nt) RNAs [18]. To tackle this problem, we and others have developed labeling technologies to incorporate stable isotopes (i.e., 2H, 13C, 19F, and 15N) into RNA to benefit NMR structure and dynamics measurements [7, 19\u201327]. * T.

Then, we used enzymes from the nucleotide salvage biosynthetic pathway to couple the labeled nucleobase to commercially available ribose sources to build the corresponding [7-15N]-guanosine-5\u2032-triphosphates (GTPs) [20, 28, 29]. This labeling scheme leverages the narrow linewidths of the 15N nuclei [30, 31] and will therefore be important when applied to large RNAs. Moreover, the N7 atom in the major groove can serve as a reporter of binding events between nucleic acids and ligands such as metals, drugs, or protein side chains [32, 33].\nTo showcase the utility of our labels, we incorporated our [7-15N]-GTPs into two RNAs [33, 34] via T7 RNA polymerase (RNAP)-based in\u00a0vitro transcription and used one (1D)-, two (2D)-, and three (3D)-dimensional NMR experiments to probe RNA structure and dynamics."

            "text": "Synthesis of the isotope-labeled nucleobase was carried out in three chemical steps following previously established methods [35] with slight modifications (Scheme\u00a01). The synthesis of [7-15N]-guanine began with the nitrosylation of commercially available 2,6-diaminopyrimidin-4-ol by 15N-labeled sodium nitrite to yield 2,6-diamino-5-[nitroso15N]pyrimidin-4-ol (1). Reduction by sodium dithionite followed by acidification by sulfuric acid then gave the sulfate salt of 2,6-diamino-5-[amino-15N]pyrimidin-4-ol (2). In the final chemical step, reflux of 2 with formamide followed by formic acid provided the desired [7-15N]-guanine (3). Intermediate compounds 1 and 2 showed the expected 1H NMR\nspectra (Figs. S1, S2). The formation and purity of 3 was confirmed by 1H, 13C, and 15N NMR (Figs. S3, S4) and highresolution mass spectroscopy (HR-MS) (Fig. S5).\nWith the labeled nucleobase 3 in-hand, we utilized enzymes from the nucleotide salvage biosynthetic pathway to couple 3 to either fully protonated [1H6]-d-ribose or fully deuterated [2H6]-d-ribose to form the desired GTPs 4a and 4b, respectively (Scheme\u00a01), as previously described [20]. Briefly, [1H6]- and [2H6]-d-ribose were phosphorylated to ribose-5-phosphate (R5P) by ribokinase (RK, EC 2.7.1.15). Then, R5P was converted to 5-phospho-d-ribosyl-\u03b1-1pyrophosphate (5PRP) by phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase (PRPPS, EC 2.7.6.1). Coupling of 3 to 5PRP from the previous step was afforded by xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferases (XGPRT, EC 2.4.2.22) to yield [7-15N]-guanosine-5\u2032-monophosphate ([7-15N]-GMP). Guanylate kinase (GK, EC 2.7.4.8) converted GMP to [7-15N]-guanosine-5\u2032-diphosphate ([7-15N]-GDP), which was then phosphorylated by creatine kinase (CK, EC 2.7.3.2) to form the desired GTP products 4a and 4b. Complete conversion of 3 to 4a and 4b was confirmed by 31P NMR (Fig. S6), as previously described [36].\nTaken together, our synthetic route provides 4a and 4b in three chemical steps and one enzymatic step with a single chromatographic purification. Furthermore, while the present work used [1H6]- and [2H6]-d-ribose, our method enables the coupling of 3 to any ribose source to create a versatile assortment of atom-specifically labeled rNTPs for use in in\u00a0vitro transcription and NMR."

            "text": "Our reason for synthesizing 4a and 4b was to characterize the structure and dynamics of biologically important RNAs. Thus, we used 4a and 4b along with unlabeled ATP, CTP, and UTP to make two RNAs by in\u00a0vitro transcription:\n1 3\na 4b-labeled 27\u00a0nt fragment from the human cytoplasmic A-site ribosomal RNA (A-site) and a 4a-labeled 35\u00a0nt fragment from domain 5 of the group II intron ribozyme from brown algae (domain 5) (Fig.\u00a01).\nAs a first application, we employed a two-bond (2JH8N7) 2D heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) experiment on 4a-labeled domain 5 RNA. We obtained a wellresolved 2D spectrum, showing all 13 guanosine H8-N7 resonances (Fig.\u00a02a). A necessary NMR parameter for structure determination is proton\u2013proton distances, which is provided by nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) experiments. While these data are informative, crowded proton\u2013proton NOEs can be resolved into a third dimension with 13C- or 15N-editing. As a second application, we employed a 15N-edited 3D NOESY HSQC experiment on 4a-labeled domain 5 to reveal all protons within ~ 5\u00a0\u00c5 of guanosine H8 [38]. In A-helical RNA, guanosine H8 protons show strong NOE cross-peaks to 5\u2032-neighboring H2\u2032 protons (Fig.\u00a02b), which are traditionally difficult to assign due to severe overlap with other ribose protons (i.e., H3\u2032, H4\u2032, H5\u2032, and H5\u2033) [37\u201339]. We therefore used the chemical shift of guanosine N7 to resolve NOE cross-peaks of H2\u2032 protons to H8. Examples of cross-peaks are shown for helical residues G8 and G22, as well as residues G15 and G26 from the apical loop and internal bulge, respectively (Fig.\u00a02c).\nAs a final application, we probed the dynamics of 4b-labeled A-site RNA. Two common relaxation parameters in biomolecules are the longitudinal (R1) and\ntransverse (R2) relaxation rates [40, 41]. While R1 measures the rate of recovery of the z-magnetization to equilibrium, R2 reports on the rate of the decay of x- and y-magnetization [40]. An alternative method to obtain R2 is a transverse rotating-frame (R1\u03c1) experiment wherein magnetization is aligned along an effective field whose direction is dependent upon the power of the radio frequency (RF) field and its offset [42]. We therefore employed pseudo-2D HSQC-based experiments to determine R1 and R1\u03c1 relaxation rates of guanosine H8 protons (Fig.\u00a03a). We obtained rates for 5 of the 9 guanosines in A-site, with R1 and R1\u03c1 values ranging from 1.75 to 2.00/s and 15.26 to 21.25/s, respectively. Interestingly, G16 showed the highest R1 and lowest R1\u03c1, indicative of increased flexibility, suggesting the G:C base pair preceding the tetraloop is not stable. These data contribute to our understanding of the dynamic motions within the A-site RNA [43, 44]."

An INEPT delay of 31.25\u00a0ms (a coupling constant of 8\u00a0Hz) was used for coherence transfer. For the 1H dimension, the spectral width was set to 20\u00a0ppm and the carrier to 12\u00a0ppm. For the 15N dimension, the spectral width was set to 5\u00a0ppm and the carrier to 240\u00a0ppm. The two-bond (2JH8N7) 2D HSQC experiment was performed with 128 scans and 100 and 1024 complex points in the 15N and 1H dimensions, respectively. The 15N and 1H carrier frequencies were set to 235.5\u00a0ppm and 4.7\u00a0ppm, respectively; the spectral width for the 15N and 1H dimensions were set to 9 and 12\u00a0ppm, respectively. The 15N-edited 3D NOESY HSQC experiment was carried out on a 600\u00a0MHz magnet Avance III spectrometer with a TXI triple resonance probe using previously described pulse sequences [38]. For each 3D data set, 200 \u00d7 128 complex points were used for the indirect 1H and 15N dimensions along with 64 transients and 10% non-uniform sine-weighted Poisson-gap sampling [49]. The spectral width of the 15N and 1H dimensions were set to 5.2 and 10.0\u00a0ppm, respectively; the carrier was set to 235.1 and 4.7\u00a0ppm, for the 15N and 1H dimensions, respectively.\nR1 and R1\u03c1 relaxation rates on the guanosine-N7 nitrogen atoms were measured using a pseudo-2D HSQC detected experiments. These experiments were carried out with 16 scans and 1024 time domain points in the 1H dimension, using a spectral width and carrier of 16 and 4.7\u00a0ppm, respectively. For the R1 experiments, delay times of 0.02 (X2), 0.04, 0.08, 0.15, 0.30, 0.40, 0.60, 0.80, and 1.00\u00a0s were used. For the R1\u03c1 experiments, delay times of 8 (X2), 16, 20, 32, 48, 60, 80, and 100\u00a0ms were used. The strength of spin-lock field (\u03c91) was 1.9\u00a0kHz. Calibration of the spin-lock field was carried out as previously described [50]. R1 and R1\u03c1 relaxation rates were determined by fitting intensities to a monoexponential decay and errors were estimated from duplicated delay points. All NMR data were collected at 25\u00a0\u00b0C with a recycle delay of 1.5\u00a0s and analyzed using TopSpin 4.0 and NMRViewJ [51].\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s00706- 022- 02892-1.\nAcknowledgements This research was financially supported by the National Science Foundation (DBI1040158 to T.K.D.), the National Institutes of Health\u00a0(U54AI50470 to T.K.D.), the Austrian Science Fund (FWF, project P34770 and P32773 to C.K), and the Austrian Research Promotion Agency FFG (West Austrian BioNMR, 858017 to C.K).
