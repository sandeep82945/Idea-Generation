Introduction\nNonparametric efficiency analysis (e.g. DEA after Charnes, ooper, & Rhodes, 1978 FDH after Tulkens, 1993 ) is a technique sed to evaluate an entity \u2013 such as a firm, a plant, a utility, a ank, or a country \u2013 by comparing its performance with other ntities. This technique has demonstrated its usefulness in light f the significant number of applied works and extensions. 1 Re-\narkably, initiated as an operations research tool, this method has\neen set forth in a wide range of renowned journals and used to ackle various types of research questions. 2 Potential explanations or their success are their data-driven spirit \u2013 the technique is non-\narametric in nature since no a-priori assumption is required about he entities\u2019 transformation process; instead, a production possibil-\nWe thank the Editor Robert Graham Dyson and the three anonymous referees\nor their comments that substantially improved the paper.\nE-mail address: barnabe.walheer@uliege.be 1 According to Emrouznejad & Yang (2018) , 10,300 DEA-related articles were pubished between 1978 and 2016, and up to 10 0 0 journal articles were so annually in 014, 2015 and 2016. 2 Examples include macroeconomics and convergence (e.g. F\u00e4re, Grosskopf, Noris, & Zhang, 1994; Henderson & Russell, 2005; Kounetas, 2015 ), quality of life e.g. Cherchye, Lovell, Moesen, & Puyenbroeck, 2007a; Cherchye, Moesen, Rogge,\nVan Puyenbroeck, 2007b; Walheer, 2019 ), energy-environment-economics puzzle e.g. Walheer, 2018b; Zhou, Ang, & Poh, 2008 ), public economics (e.g. Valdmanis, 992 ), aquaculture (e.g. Sharma, Leung, Chen, & Peterson, 1999 ), tourism (e.g. anker & Natarajan, 2011; Huang, Ho, & Chiu, 2014; Walheer & Zhang, 2018 ), health are (e.g. Biorn, Hagen, Iversen, & Magnussen, 2003 ), and management of organizaions (e.g. Lewis & Sexton, 2004 ). These models, while deterministic, have also reeived attention from the statistics and econometrics literature (e.g. Sengupta, 1990; anker & Natarajan, 2011; Simar, Vanhems, & Van Keilegom, 2016 ).\nt w a l t i m f O\nw f w s q d\nttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2022.05.038 377-2217/\u00a9 2022 Elsevier B.V.

In practice, (in)efficiency behavior is aptured by the distance to the frontier of the reconstructed pro-\nuction possibility set.\nNevertheless, nonparametric efficiency analysis presents two mportant shortcomings; which likely account for its neglect beond the operations research literature. First, its deterministic naure is often seen as restrictive. It implies, for instance, that here is no measurement errors and no outliers. Fortunately, wellstablished solutions have been proposed such as bias-corrected nd robust nonparametric efficiency analysis methods (e.g. Daouia\nSimar, 2007; Daraio & Simar, 2007; Simar & Vanhems, 2012 ). econd, nonparametric efficiency analysis usually assumes that enities use a similar (but unknown) transformation process. In other\nords, entities are homogeneous in terms of their process. For ex-\nmple, in a production context, it is assumed that firms use a simiar (but unknown) production function. A well-established method o overcome this restriction while keeping the advantages of the nitial nonparametric efficiency analysis models, is the concept of\neta-technology ( Hayami, 1969; Hayami & Ruttan, 1970 ) or metarontier ( Battese & Rao, 2002; Battese, Rao, & O\u2019Donnell, 2004;\n\u2019Donnell, Rao, & Battese, 2008 ).\nMeta-frontier is a method tailored to deal with heterogeneity hen entities are partitioned into different groups. Basically, a diferent production possibility set is reconstructed for each group,\nhile an \u2018overall\u2019 set is defined as the envelopment of the grouppecific counterparts. In practice, the meta-frontier approach reuires to partition entities into several groups, each capturing a istinct technology.

That is, such research considers a fixed number of roups and allocates entities to each group once and for all. In\nther words, once the partitioning is made no modification is posible. While this setting may be useful in some contexts, it is genrally restrictive or even unrealistic. For instance, new technoloies can be discovered and others disappear. That is, the number f groups may not be constant over time. Also, the number of enities in each group may not be constant over time. That is, there\nay exist technology switchers, i.e. entities that adopt different echnologies over time. These different features have been omitted rom the meta-frontier technique. It is the purpose of this paper to llow for these options.\nWe apply our methodology to the case of the economic growth onvergence amongst countries. This is probably the most famous mpirical question involving technology switchers (here counries). In that case, a popular option is to partition countries into roups/clubs where technology is homogeneous inside but not beween clubs ( Azariadis & Drazen, 1990; Bernard & Jones, 1996;\nurlauf & Johnson, 1995; Galor, 1996 ). Important efforts have been ade to find coherent and consistent ways to define the clubs and\nhe partitioning of countries amongst them (e.g. threshold method, CA, variables and dimensions to consider). In fact, these two feaures are the main focus in the literature. In general, a stable numer of groups is found while some countries move from one club o another over time, i.e. some countries are technology switchrs. Different reasons can explain the willingness of a country to dopt another technology, but technology is recognized as a main ource of economic development and a main factor of economic rowth ( Bernard & Jones, 1996; Gong & Keller, 2003; Hall & Jones, 999; Islam, 1999; Prescott, 1998 ). Also, imitating or adopting new echnologies is, generally, costly, and it is therefore important to be ble to quantify the effects of the technology switch ( Abramovitz, 986 ). This is exactly the added value of our methodology in that mpirical context: evaluate the impact of the technology switchers n the technology clubs and on the countries\u2019 (in)efficiency behavor.\nThe rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 , e discuss the impact of the technoogy switchers on the metarontier. After, we set out defining some necessary concepts and\nresent our notations in Section 3 . Next, we motivate our new\nethodology by a simple illustration and define our objectives in ection 4 . In Section 5 , we define our concept of counterfactual echnologies directly useful to define the switcher effects. In fact, he switcher effects are defined as ratios of well-known and wellstablished concepts in the efficiency literature and their counteractual counterparts. In Section 6 , we apply our technique with the ase of the technology clubs and with two fictive scenarii. Finally, ection 7 concludes.\n. Meta-frontier and technology switchers\nMeta-frontier is recognized as the main tool to deal with techology heterogeneity when conducting a nonparametric efficiency nalysis. Indeed, this methodology has been applied to a large vaiety of topics revealing the attractiveness of this concept for emirical research. Examples of recent studies include Chen, Huang,\nYang (2009) for China; Kontolaimou & Tsekouras (2010) and ontolaimou, Kounetas, Mourtos, & Tsekouras (2012) for Euroean banks; Assaf, Barros, & Josiassen (2012) for hotels in Taian; Huang, Ting, Lin, & Lin (2013) for international tourist hotels; in & Du (2013) for Chinese regions; Beltran-Esteve, Gmez-Limn, icazo-Tadeo, & Reig-Martnez (2014) ) for Spanish olive producrs; Jiang & Sharp (2015) for New Zealand dairy farms; Kounetas 2015) for European countries; Duygun, Sena, & Shaban (2016) for ritish commercial banks; Fu, Juo, Chiang, Yu, & Huang (2016) for\naiwanese and Chinese banks; Tsekouras, Chatzistamoulou, Kouneas, & Broadstock (2016) for the European transportation sectors;\nzad, Munisamy, Masum, Saona, & Wanke (2017) for banks in\nalaysia; Chang & Tovar (2017) ) for the West Coast of South Paific terminals; Li, Kopsakangas-Savolainen, Xiao, & Lau (2017) for he Japanese electricity distribution sector; Walheer (2018a) for Euopean sectors.; Walheer (2019) for the Chinese electricity sector;\nas & Drine (2020) for Africa; and He, Walheer, & (2020b) and ang, Cheng, & Huang (2020) for the Chinese manufacturing secor.\nThe basic idea of the meta-frontier technique is to partition enities into groups such that each group uses a different technolgy. Common practice, common knowledge, or statistical methods ould be used to form the groups and allocate entities across them. he partitioning has been made using several criteria in empirical tudies such as ownership, geographical localization, economic inrastructure, resource endowments, social environment, operational ettings, etc. The meta-frontier is then defined as an \u2018overall\u2019 fronier that envelops the group-specific technology frontier. Technolgy gap ratios are computed to quantify the distance between the roup-specific frontiers and the meta-frontier. As such, this ratio\nrovides a measure of the gap between the technology available to ll entities and that available to a specific group of these. Attracively, this ratio enables us to disentangle actual inefficiency, i.e.\nith respect to the meta-frontier, from inefficiency with respect to\nhe group.\nA common feature of all papers cited above, and to the best f our knowledge, to the literature as a whole is the stability of heir grouping procedure. They consider that entities are allocated o each group once for all, while the number of groups is fixed ver time. The main reason for this procedure lies in the initial efinition of the meta-frontier technique as given by Battese & Rao 2002) and their followers who considered this setting as their tarting point. While useful in some cases, this setting is too retrictive, and, for some contexts, may lead to unrealistic results. or example, when dealing with panel data or large sample, sevral things may change over time requiring more flexibility for the rouping procedure.\nThe stability of the grouping procedure implies that some setings cannot be considered in the meta-frontier. First, it may be he case that a new technology is discovered (i.e. a new group is reated) or that a technology disappears (i.e. an exiting group is eleted). Second, the number of entities in each group may not e constant over time. That is, some entities may change of group ver time. Such entities are called technology switchers since they o not use the same technology over time. Putting this differently, n entity is a technology switcher in the meta-frontier context if it oes not belong to the same group over time. One of the objectives f this paper is to allow for more flexibility in the meta-frontier y considering the possibility of group creation and disappearance, nd by recognizing the existing of technology switchers.\nTechnology switchers have been found in several empirical orks at microeconomic (e.g. Aravindakshan, Rossi, Amjath-Babu, eettil, & Krupnik, 2018; Bos, Candelon, & Economidou, 2016; Bos, conomidou, Koetter, & Kolari, 2010b; He, Walheer, and, 2020b; ynninen, Ojala, & Pehkonen, 2013 ) and macroeconomic levels e.g. Amsler, O\u2019Donnell, & Schmidt, 2017; Bos et al., 2010b; Castelacci, 2008; Castellacci, 2011; Castellacci & Archibugi, 2008; Castelacci & Natera, 2016; Owen, Videras, & Davis, 2009; Saba & David,\n020; Stollinger, 2013; Walheer, 2021 ). From an intuitive point of iew, it is indeed difficult to believe that all entities keep the same echnology over time. From a theoretical point of view, the exstence of technology switchers requires new models with more\nexibility (e.g. Acemoglu, Aghion, & Zilibotti, 2006; Green, 2005; owitt, 20 0 0; Howitt & Mayer-Foulkes, 20 05; Orea & Kumbhakar, 004; Tsionas & Kumbhakar, 2004 ).

A second objective f this paper is to offer these options with the additional advanage of distinguishing the direct (on the switchers) and the indirect on the non-switchers) effects.\nAll in all, the main novelty of this paper is to recognize the exsting of technology switchers in the meta-frontier methodology.\nhis implies, first, to allow for more flexibility in the meta-frontier y considering that the number of groups may not be fixed over ime while some entities may change of groups. Once the exisence of technology switchers is admitted, the next step is to quanify the impacts of such entities on the meta-frontier. This is the econd contribution of this paper: provide an easy and intuitive\nay to quantify the impact of the technology switchers on the in)efficiency behavior and the technology gap. In fact, we go a bit urther by distinguishing the direct and indirect impact.\n. Preliminaries\nThe starting point of our approach is the observation of entities or several periods of time { 1 , . . . , T } . The specificities of our setp is to consider technology heterogeneity among entities and the xistence of technology switchers, i.e. entities that adopt another echnology over time. We consider that there are I t different tech-\nologies available at time t . That is, the number of technologies is ot fixed over time: new technology may be developed and other e phased out over time.\nWe adopt a nonparametric approach when defining the techologies. In practice, the observed input-output data of the entiies, defined by x and y respectively, are used to reconstruct the echnologies by means of a production possibility sets. That is, it s known at time t which technology each entity has adopted at ime t , and this for every t \u2208 { 1 , . . . , T } . Let us denote the group f firms adopting technology i at time t by S i t . We obtain the folowing production possibility set for a specific group i at time t:\ni t (S i t ) = { (x , y ) | x can produce y using the\ntechnology at time t determined by S i t } . (1)\nT i t (S i t ) is the reconstruction of technology i at time t using the bserved input-output data of entities that have adopted this techology. T i t (S i t ) contains all possible input-output combinations us-\nng technology i at time t . T i t (S i t ) therefore is an estimator of the\nnknown technology i at time t . These sets are directly useful to valuate the (in)efficiency behavior of the entities that is captured y the distance to their frontier, i.e the boundary of the production ossibility set. Without loss of generality, we consider an outputriented technical efficiency measurement. That is, technical effiiency checks whether outputs could be increased given the inputs. n other words, we investigate for potential outputs. When selectng technology i at time t , the technical efficiency measurement of\nparticular entity operating at (x , y ) is defined as follows: E i t (y , x ) = inf { \u03b8 | ( x , y\n\u03b8\n) \u2208 T i t (S i t ) } . (2)\nE i t (y , x ) is smaller or equal to unity and a lower value indiates greater technical inefficiency. T E i t (y , x ) represents how far way the actual outputs are from the potential outputs. When E i t (y , x ) = 1 , it means that they coincide. When T E i t (y , x ) < 1 , t implies that the actual outputs represent T E i t (y , x ) \u00d7 100% of he potential output quantities. Graphically, the technical efficiency\neasurement is defined as the distance to the frontier of the reonstructed production possibility set. In practice, technical effiiency is computed by means of a linear programming which is iven in Appendix A .\nAnother focus of our investigation is the technology gap which easures whether entities have chosen the most productive tech-\nology available. It is defined as the distance between the group-\nevel technology and an \u2018overall\u2019 or best practice technology for ach period of time t . That is, the envelopment of the group-level echnologies at that period of time: t = { T 1 t (S 1 t ) \u222a T 2 t (S 2 t ) \u222a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u222a T I t (S I t ) } , (3)\nhis is a standard way of defining the overall technology, which ates at least to Battese & Rao (2002) . We notice that the envelop\ns non-convex in general ( Jin, Kerstens, & Woestyne, 2020; Wal-\neer, 2018a ), while imposing convexity is possible if needed but epresents an additional assumption about the production process. here is a tradition in the literature to define that \u2018overall\u2019 techology as the meta-technology ( Hayami & Ruttan, 1970 ) and its rontier as the meta-frontier ( Battese et al., 2004; O\u2019Donnell et al., 008 ).\nThe technology gap is defined as the ratio of technical efficiency ith respect to the meta- and group-specific frontiers. For a paricular entity, operating at (x , y ) , and technology i we obtain the ollowing:\nG i t (y , x ) = T E t (y , x )\nT E i t (y , x ) , (4)\nhere T E t (y , x ) = inf { \u03b8 | (x , y\n\u03b8\n) \u2208 T t } is the technical efficiency\neasurement with respect to the meta-frontier at time t . This oncept has to be interpreted as T E i t (y , x ) , but when the aggreated technology is selected. Also, by construction, we have that E t (y , x ) \u2264 T E i t (y , x ) . This inequality is immediately verified when oticing that the group-specific technologies are included in the ggregated technology (it is defined as their envelopment in(3)). his also highlights the consequence of wrongly assuming techology homogeneity (technical efficiency would be overestimated). G i t (y , x ) is therefore smaller or equal to one by construction. If t is equal to unity, it means that there is no technology gap, .e. the entity has chosen the best practice technology. Lower val-\nes indicate a larger technology gap, i.e. a better technology ex-\nsts and technology improvement therefore is possible. T G i t (y , x ) is omputed a-posteriori after evaluating T E i t (y , x ) and T E t (y , x ) ; see\nppendix A for more detail.\n. Motivation and objectives\nWe provide a simple example to formulate our objectives. Asume we observe five entities labelled A , B , C, D , and E at two onsecutive time periods t \u2212 1 and t . For simplicity, we assume hat they produce one output using one input, and that the inpututput levels are the same in both time periods. This allows us o only focus our discussion on the switcher effects. We also asume that two different technologies coexist and that entities are istributed as given in Table 1 . Finally, we assume that entities B nd D are switchers, i.e. they adopt another technology at time t . ractically, it means that they belong to a different group at time \u2212 1 and t . On the contrary, entities A , C, and E are not technology witchers as they belong to the same group at time t \u2212 1 and t .\nI i r t l r\na g t n s\no s t\nt a a m o s f n\nTable 2 Simulation - impacts of the switchers at t .\nTime t \u2212 1 t Group 1 2 1 2 Inefficient / E / /\nGroup frontier D, C A, B B, C A, D, E\nTechnology gap D, E D, E Meta-frontier ABWC AZBC\nf d c d e w\nThe reconstructed technologies at time t are given in Fig. 1 (a). n particular, T 1 and T 2 are the group-specific production possibilty sets at time t , while T is the meta-technology. To avoid trivial econstructions and to match common practice, we assume that he group-specific production possibility sets satisfy some reguarity conditions: they are monotone, convex, and satisfy variable eturns-to-scale. 3\nThe meta-frontier is defined by AZBC at time t . Note that Z is fictive entity and that the meta-frontier is non-convex, while the\nroup-level frontiers are. All entities are efficient since they lie on heir group-specific frontier. Also, entity D and E present a techology gap, i.e. they have not adopted the best practice technology ince they are not on the meta-frontier.\nNext, we construct counterfactual technologies at time t based n the groups as defined at t \u2212 1 in Fig. 1 (b). That is, we recontruct the technologies as if there were no switchers, i.e. all entiies have the same technology at t \u2212 1 and t . This time, the meta-\n3 Note that these regularity conditions are not essential for us; they are selected o make the graphical illustration as clear and simple as possible (and because they re popular to practitioners). The selecting reconstruction procedure is also known s Data envelopment analysis (DEA) after Charnes et al., 1978 ). It is fairly easy to\nake a similar example without assuming convex group technologies or using an-\nther returns-to-scale assumption. This will not change the positive impact of the witchers. The meta-technology is, as stated in(3), the envelopment of the group rontiers. There is no specific reason to obtain a convex set. In Fig. 1 , it is indeed on-convex. Similar comments apply to Figs. 2 and 3 .\nd f t c i\nb i c i\nrontier is defined by ABW C; W is again a fictive entity. We imme-\niately appreciate the significant effects of the switchers on the reonstructed technologies. First, the group-specific technologies are ifferent, which directly impacts the (in)efficient behavior of the ntities. For instance, entity E is no longer efficient. In other words,\ne may interpret the efficient behavior of entity E at time t as ue to the switchers only. Second, the meta-technology is also dif-\nerent because of the switchers impacting the technology gaps of he entities. For example, entity D is closer to the frontier of the ounterfactual meta-technology. We summarize our observations n Table 2 .\nIt turns out that the switchers have a huge impact on their own ehavior, but also on that of the other entities. All these impacts\nnfluence the reconstructed technologies. This fact has so far been ompletely ignored when dealing with the meta-frontier approach n both theoretical extensions and empirical works. In light of our\no i g e d o t n\n5\ni n d t t a i\nC\ni t n\nv\nC\nA o l e t t s\nc & p\nc t c t a\nC\no T c f e n\nE\nn ( W d i t i a h o T s p\nt e n i\nbservations, we formulate our objectives as follows: (i ) defin-\nng the impact of the switchers on the group-specific technoloies [technical efficiency]; (ii ) defining the impact of the switchrs on the meta-technology [technology gap]; and (iii ) be able to\nistinguish the effects on the switchers themselves from those on ther entities [direct and indirect effects]. To do so, we build on he concept of counterfactual technologies formally defined in the ext Section.\n. Counterfactual technologies and switcher effects\nTo quantify the impact of the switchers on the efficiency behavor and the technology gap, we make use of counterfactual tech-\nologies. 4 In particular, we define the notion of counterfactual prouction possibility set defined as the reconstruction of the hypohetical technology at time t using entities that have adopted this echnology at the previous time period (i.e. at t \u2212 1 ). That is, it is s if no entity has left or joined the group between t \u2212 1 and t . It s given for group j as follows:\nT j t (S j t\u22121 ) = { (x , y ) | x can produce y using the\ntechnology at time t determined by S j t\u22121\n} . (5)\nIn words, this counterfactual set is defined at time t using nput-output data at time t of entities belonging to group j at time\n\u2212 1 . We recall that S j t\u22121 contains entities that have adopted techology j at time t \u2212 1 . The \u2018aggregated\u2019 counterfactual technology is defined as the enelop of the group-specific counterfactual technologies: T t = { CT 1 t (S 1 t\u22121 ) \u222a CT 2 t (S 2 t\u22121 ) \u222a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u222a CT I t (S I t\u22121 ) } , (6)\nCT t is the envelopment of the counterfactual group-level sets. s the meta-technology T t , given in (3), CT t is defined using inpututput data at time t , and is generally non-convex. We may thus\nabel CT t as the counterfactual meta-technology. The only differnce between both sets is that CT t is based on the group reparition of entities at time t \u2212 1 while it is the repartition at time that is used for T t . This twist, while simple, allows us to define witcher effects are explained after.\n4 The idea of using counterfactual technologies is, in fact, not new in the effi-\niency literature. For example, the Malmquist index, defined by Caves, Christensen,\nDiewert (1982) , is based on a similar concept. Counterfactual concepts are often\nresent when time is involved in the efficiency analysis.\nt i e t a S\nOur aim is to quantify the impact of switchers on the effiiency and technology gap of all entities. This concerns not only he switchers themselves but also the other entities. Using our ounterfactual production possibility sets, we define the following echnical efficiency measurement for a particular entity operating t (x , y ) : T E j t (y , x ) = inf { \u03b8 | ( x , y\n\u03b8\n) \u2208 CT j t (S j t\u22121 ) } . (7)\nCT E j t (y , x ) is a counterfactual measurement since it is based n an hypothetical set. Nevertheless, it has to be interpreted as E i t (y , x ) , i.e. it is not greater than one while lower values indiate larger efficiency behaviour with respect to the counterfactual rontier. Using this new concept, we define the efficiency switcher ffect of an entity operating at (y , x ) that has moved from tech-\nology j to technology i (denoted as j \u2192 i ) as follows:\nSE j\u2192 i t (y , x ) = CT E j t (y , x )\nT E i t (y , x ) . (8)\nClearly, when ESE j\u2192 i (y , x ) = 1 , it means that the switchers have o impact on the efficiency behavior of the entity operating at y , x ) . This value therefore represents our benchmark scenario.\nhen this is not the case, the impact is observed. We have to istinguish two cases: those when the efficiency switcher effect\ns larger or smaller than the unity. If ESE j\u2192 i (y , x ) > 1 , it means hat counterfactual technical efficiency, i.e. technical efficiency as f switchers have not joined or leaved the groups, is larger than ctual technical efficiency, i.e. technical efficiency when switchers\nave joined or leaved the groups. Putting this differently, the entity perating at (x , y ) is away from the frontier because of switchers. hat is, there are more potential output expansions thanks to the witchers. When ESE j\u2192 i (y , x ) < 1 , it is the opposite: there is less otential output expansions due to the switchers.\nAt this point, we highlight that we have not specified whether he entity operating at (y , x ) is a switcher or not. Putting differntly, ESE j\u2192 i (y , x ) can be evaluated for any input-output combiations, i.e. for any entities. When an entity is non-switcher, it mplies that i = j, i.e. the entity keeps the same technology. It urns out that our definition of the efficiency switcher effect easly allows us to distinguish the switchers ( i = j) from the other ntities ( i = j). Therefore, we are able to quantify the impacts of he switchers on their own efficiency behavior, i.e. a direct effect, nd the impacts on the other entities, i.e. an indirect effect. See ection 6 for an empirical example.\np t fi e h t t e d m e t\nt fi\nC\nw t C t\ne a\nT\nA W w f w o i p o s s f v\ns\nE\nW w o a g s fi g l c i w\nd A\nd t t t r o t f o t t e T\n6\ni s G a t o d l 2 i t a n J\nt i n a F ? e t l p m R g e e h\nt i g d t o i n t\nWe illustrate the efficiency switcher effect in Fig. 2 . We there resent the reconstructed production possibility set and the counerfactual counterpart for a fictive group. 5 We also consider two\nctive entities belonging to that group: A and B . They are both infficient since they do not lie on the frontier. Their inefficient beavior is evaluated as the distance to this set in the output direcion. Next, the counterfactual production possibility set allows us o remove the switcher effect. It is shown that entity A is less infficient due to the switchers. In other words, the switchers have eteriorated the efficiency behavior of entity A which therefore has\nore potential output expansions. It is the opposite situation for ntity B : the switchers have improved its efficiency behavior so hat this has less potential output expansion.\nOur second focus is to quantify the impact of the switchers on he technology gap. The counterfactual technology gap ratio is de-\nned for an entity operating at (y , x ) as follow:\nT G j t (y , x ) = CT E t (y , x )\nCT E j t (y , x ) , (9)\nhere CT E t (y , x ) = inf { \u03b8 | (x , y\n\u03b8\n) \u2208 CT t } . Again, this counterfac-\nual measurement has to be interpreted as the technology gap T G j t (y , x ) defined above with respect to the counterfactual froniers.\nWe define the technology gap switcher effect for an entity oprating at (y , x ) that has moved from technology j to technology i s follows:\nGSE j\u2192 i t (y , x ) = CT G j t (y , x )\nT G i t (y , x ) . (10)\ns for the efficiency switcher effect, the benchmark value is unity.\nhen T GSE j\u2192 i t (y , x ) > 1 , it means that the technology gap is larger hen switchers are taken into account. That is, the entity is further rom the \u2018overall\u2019 or meta-frontier because of the switcher. In other\nords, the switchers have deteriorated the frontier of the technol-\ngy adopted by the entity with respect the meta-frontier, mean-\nng that there is more potential technology improvement. The op-\nosite case is when T GSE j\u2192 i t (y , x ) < 1 , the entity is closer to the verall frontier and less potential technology improvement is posible. Again we point out that our definition of the technology gap witcher effect is general enough to allow us to distinguish the efect on the switchers themselves or on the other entities. We proide an empirical example in Section 6 .\nFinally, we highlight that the efficiency and technology gap\nwitcher effects can be related as follows:\nSE j\u2192 i t (y , x ) \u00d7 T GSE j\u2192 i t (y , x ) = CT E t (y , x )\nT E t (y , x ) . (11)\ne obtain this relationship by combining (8), (9), and (10). In ords, this relationship could be understood as a decomposition\nf an \u2018overall\u2019 efficiency switcher effect (the right-hand side) into\ngroup-specific efficiency switcher effect (ESE) and a technology ap switcher effect (TGSE). Putting this differently, the efficiency witcher effect could be seen as a residual part of the \u2018overall\u2019 efciency switcher effect due to the group only once the technology ap switcher effect has been removed. As a final remark, we highight that the decomposition is based on the well-established conepts in Section 3 and their counterfactual counterparts as defined n Section 5 . The decomposition, therefore, is directly connected\nith the existing literature.\n5 The reconstructed sets are, in practice, obtained using observed input-output\nata while imposing some technology axioms. See our discussion of Fig. 1 and ppendix A .\no n n p f\nTo illustrate the technology gap switcher effect and the above ecomposition, we again use a simple example. Let us consider he case of entity A in Fig. 3 . The meta-technology is T and enity A belongs to group 1 with associated technology T 1 . Note that he technologies of the other groups are not represented for better eadability, and that the meta-technology is obtained as an envelpment of the group frontiers. Entity A presents a technology gap hat is captured by the ratio AB over AE. When using the counteractual technologies, we obtain AC divided by AD for the technolgy gap. So, the switcher effect is AC/AD divided by AB/AE. Also, he switcher efficiency effect with respect to the group-specific echnology is given by AB over AC. By multiplying the two switcher ffects, we obtain the \u2018overall\u2019 efficiency switcher effect: AE/AD . his result highlights the above decomposition.\n. Empirical application\nWe apply our new concepts to the case of the technology clubs n the world economy. Several studies, initiated by Durlauf & Johnon (1995) , Bernard & Jones (1996) , Bernard & Durlauf (1996) and\nalor (1996) , have pointed out the existence of technology clubs mong countries. This is probably the most famous empirical quesion involving technology switchers, i.e. countries that adopt anther technology over time (e.g. Amsler et al., 2017; Bos, Economiou, & Koetter, 2010a; Castellacci, 2008; Castellacci, 2011; Castelacci & Archibugi, 2008; Castellacci & Natera, 2016; Owen et al.,\n009; Saba & David, 2020; Stollinger, 2013; Walheer, 2021 ). Indeed,\nt is intuitively difficult to believe that all countries keep the same echnology over time. In fact, technology change is recognized as\nmain source of economic development and a main factor of eco-\nomic growth ( Bernard & Jones, 1996; Gong & Keller, 2003; Hall &\nones, 1999; Islam, 1999; Prescott, 1998 ).\nFrom a practical point of view, a popular option is to partiion countries into groups/clubs where technology is homogeneous nside but not between clubs. While well-known statistical tech-\niques have been used to compute the number of technology clubs nd allocate countries into each club, two main problems remain. irst, how to parametrically define the different club technologies\nIndeed, several production functions have to be specified, and ven when strong arguments are found to choose specific funcional forms, it could be computationally cumbersome given the imited number of countries in the world. The nonparametric ap-\nroach can help here, and has gained attention in the empirical\nacroeconomic literature ( Fiaschi & Lavezzi, 2007; Henderson &\nussell, 2005; Kumar & Russell, 2002; Maasoumi, Racine, & Stenos, 2007; Walheer, 2016, 2021 ). Second, how to deal with switchrs, i.e. countries that move across clubs ? The literature hardly vokes this second issue. This is where the suggested method can elp.\nUsing our methodology, we are able to quantify the impact of he switchers on the meta-frontier and the group-specific frontiers, .e. the impacts of the (in)efficiency behavior and the technology aps. Attractively, our technique is flexible enough to allow us to\nistinguish the effects on the switchers themselves from those on he other entities; i.e. distinguishing the direct and indirect effects f the technology switchers. This gives us the opportunity to verfy whether it was judicious to adopt a new technology and the\nature of the impact on the entities left behind. Also, we are able o deal with the creation of new technology and the phasing out f a technology as highlighted with the two additional fictive scearii considered. All in all, our new concepts allow us to provide ew important information about how technology switchers imact technology clubs and countries\u2019 efficiency behavior. It thereore represents a complementary tool to existing ones.\nTable 3 Technology switchers in 20 0 0.\nClub Technology switchers Splitting conditions\nAdvanced - literacy rate > 68%\nscientific articles > 334\nFollowers Honk Kong, South Korea, Singapore, literacy rate > 68%;\nAustria, Belgium, France scientific articles < 334\nMarginalized China, Indonesia, Vietnam,\nIran, Oman, Albania, literacy rate < 68% El Salvador, Honduras, Algeria, scientific articles < 334 Botswana, Mauritius, Tunisia, Zimbabwe\n6\nt d & 2 c C M d t l 2\na N t e s a i o i t a p o T t g\ne o t c C v i M t o r\n6\nt g i\nm m\no e o o p p\nt o t t o t d t\n6\ns c T t t f M t f fi e\nT g e c g e\nf t\n.1. Club definitions and technology switchers\nWhile it is generally admitted that there is a club of rich counries, sub-groups are found amongst poor ones on the basis of aditional variables, such as human capital ( Castellacci, 2008; Durlauf\nJohnson, 1995; Kalaitzidakis, Mamuneas, Savvides, & Stengos, 001 ), institutional factors ( Alfo, Trovato, & Waldmann, 2008 ), soial conditions ( Apergis, 2015 ), geographical characteristics ( Bloom, anning, & Sevilla, 2003 ), and ownership ( He, Walheer, and, 2020a;\naasoumi et al., 2007 ). Recently, it has been argued that two main\nimensions can capture countries\u2019 technology level: their innovaive ability and their absorptive capacity ( Castellacci, 2011; Castelacci & Archibugi, 20 08; Howitt, 20 0 0; Howitt & Mayer-Foulkes,\n005 ; Stokke, 2008; Castellacci & Natera, 2016 ).\nSeveral options are available to define the groups/clubs such s common practice, common knowledge, or statistical methods. ote that any techniques can be used to define the groups and he technology switchers; this has not impact on the methodology xposed in this paper. In this application, we make used of a clasification and regression tree analysis (CART) using the innovative bility and the absorptive capacity of a sample of 128 countries n 1990 and 20 0 0. Innovative ability is measured by the number\nf patents and the number of scientific articles; absorptive capac-\nty is measured by the level of human capital (literacy rate, toal number of school years, secondary schooling, higher education) nd technological infrastructures (fixed telephony, electricity, com-\nuters, Internet users). CART is a flexible non-parametric method f cluster analysis ( Breiman, Friedman; Durlauf & Johnson, 1995 ). he general idea of CART is to construct a hierarchical classificaion where each step of the algorithm splits a group into two subroups (nodes) based on one single predictor variable.\nWe obtain three technology clubs labelled \u2018Advanced\u2019, \u2018Followrs\u2019, and \u2018Marginalized\u2019. Advanced countries perform well in terms f both innovative ability and absorptive capacity; follower counries have low innovative ability but relatively high absorptive apacity; and marginalized economies are poor in both aspects. ountries are allocated in the clubs using slitting conditions proided by the CART. We find the presence of six switchers movng from the Followers to the Advanced club, and 13 from the\narginalized to the Follower club (see Table 3 ). Practically, a counry is a technology switcher when it meets the slitting conditions f another club over time. We do not find evidence of technology egression. More detail on the countries is provided in Appendix B .\n.2. Efficiency and technology gap\nAs an initial step, we compute the average efficiency scores and he technology gaps for the three clubs in t = 20 0 0 . 6 They are iven in Table 4 . We point out that the averages are computed usng specific weights. It has indeed been pointed out that relying\n6 To avoid trivial reconstructions and to match common practice in empirical acroeconomics, we assume that the club-specific production possibility sets are onotone, convex, and satisfy constant returns-to-scale.\nv\na\nn an arithmetic average is probably not a good solution for the fficiency measurement ( F\u00e4re & Zelenyuk, 2003 ) and the technolgy gap ratio ( Walheer, 2018a ). Usually the weights depend on the utput prices except when one output is present in the production rocess. In that case, the weights only depend on the actual and otential outputs, as it is the case here.\nThe results in Table 4 confirm that the advanced club presents he best performances for both dimensions. The average technolgy gap is close to one indicating that this club defines the world echnology. Next, we find the followers with good performance in echnology gap, though they are, on average, further from their wn frontier as indicated by the average efficiency scores. Finally, he marginalized countries have the worst performances in both imensions. Overall, our results are coherent with the definition of he three clubs.\n.3. Switcher effects\nNext, we compute the switcher effects for the efficiency meaurement and for the technology gap. To do so, we rely on the oncept of counterfactual technologies as explained in Section 5 . he main idea is to reconstruct the technologies as if all counries use the same technology during the time span 1990\u201320 0 0, i.e. here is no technology switchers. As an illustration, we provide the rontier (see (2)) and the counterfactual frontier (see (5)) for the\narginalized club for 20 0 0 in Fig. 4 . We immediately appreciate he important impacts of technology switchers on the technology rontier of that club. Such impacts will be computed using the ef-\nciency switcher effect (see (8)) and the technology gap switcher ffect (see (10)).\nThe averages of the switcher effects for all clubs are given in able 5 . As explained earlier, our methodology allows us to distinuish the effects on the switchers and on the other countries. 7 For xample, we are able to verify how switchers in the Marginalized ountries\u2019 group have impacted countries that have not leave the roup ( E SE M\u2192 M t (y , x ) ), themselves ( E SE M\u2192 F t (y , x ) ), and the Followrs\u2019 group ( E SE F \u2192 F t (y , x ) ). Let us first introduce our discussion of this table with the efects of the switchers on the other entities. A first observation is hat the switchers have no impact on the other entities in the adanced and follower clubs. This means that the switchers have not\n7 Here, we rely on arithmetic averages since there is no theoretical framework for\nggregating the switcher effects. See the Conclusion for more discussion.\nTable 5 Switcher effects.\nClub 1990 Club 20 0 0 Efficiency switcher effect Technology gap switcher effect Advanced Advanced E SE A \u2192 A t (y , x ) 1.00 T GSE A \u2192 A t (y , x ) 1.00 Followers Advanced E SE F\u2192 A t (y , x ) 1.07 T GSE F\u2192 A t (y , x ) 0.94 Followers Followers E SE F\u2192 F t (y , x ) 1.00 T GSE F\u2192 F t (y , x ) 1.00 Marginalized Followers E SE M\u2192 F t (y , x ) 1.27 T GSE M\u2192 F t (y , x ) 0.83 Marginalized Marginalized E SE M\u2192 M t (y , x ) 0.96 T GSE M\u2192 M t (y , x ) 1.05\nm r c t l t g t f\ne n a t a t c t s t\n6\ng fi w n t t\nh d r c a a B & 2 h\ns s A t t t t c t l t d F a t T g\ne\nodified the frontiers of these two clubs. This is not a fanciful esult as we may expect that indeed switchers have joined these lubs to benefit from the knowledge or imitate the entities. Next, he marginalized club is directly impacted by the entities that have eft the club. The efficiency switcher effect is below unity, meaning hat less potential output expansion is possible, and the technology ap switcher effect is also smaller than one, meaning that less poential technology improvement is possible. This is rather bad news or this club.\nNext, it is verified that the switchers have impacted their own fficiency behavior and technology gap by adopting another techology. The switchers that have joined the advanced club presents n average efficiency switcher effect lar ger than one, meaning hat more potential output expansion is possible, while the averge technology gap switcher effect is smaller than one, meaning hat less potential technology improvement is possible. The latter ould be understood as the direct effect of adopting a best pracice technology. Similar findings are observed for entities that have witched from the marginalized club to the followers; the averages, hough, are more extreme.\n.4. Fictive scenarii\nTo show how our methodology is used when the number of roups (and thus technologies) change over time we present two ctive scenarii for our empirical application. In the first scenario,\ne consider that some marginalized countries have developed a ew technology instead of joining the followers. 8 In the second ficive scenario, we consider that all Advanced and Followers counries share the same technology in 2010. That is, one technology\n8 To do so we fix the number of groups to four in the CART.\nfi i\nas been phased out over time. Table 6 summarizes our two aditional scenarii. Note that these scenarii, while fictive, are diectly inspired by findings in the literature. Indeed, while one lub is found for the rich countries, two or three clubs are usully found amongst poor ones depending on the cluster technique nd the variables used to define the clubs (e.g. Alfo et al., 2008; loom et al., 20 03; Castellacci, 20 08; Castellacci, 2011; Castellacci\nArchibugi, 2008; Durlauf & Johnson, 1995; Kalaitzidakis et al., 0 01; Maasoumi et al., 20 07 Stokke, 20 08; Apergis, 2015; He, Waleer, and, 2020a; Walheer, 2021 ).\nAs before, we start by presenting averages for the efficiency cores and the technology gaps for t = 20 0 0 for our two fictive cenarii in Table 7 . A first observation is that the results for the dvanced and Marginalized groups are similar for Scenario A than hose found in Table 4 . This means that the creation of a new echnology by some Marginalized countries has not impacted these wo group technologies. On the contrary, it has a clear impact on he results of the Followers that have now a lower average effiiency score and technology gap. We also note that the average echnical efficiency score technology gap of the Emerging group ies between those of the Followers and Marginalized; this makes he Emerging countries the third best technology in the world. Un-\ner scenario B, we only have results for two groups in 2010 as the ollowers\u2019 group has disappeared by that year. All these countries re now part of the Advanced group. We see a direct impact on he results for that group with respect to the benchmark case (see able 4 ): greater average inefficiency and larger average technology ap.\nResults for the average efficiency and technology gap switcher ffects for the different groups and scenarii are given in Table 8 . A rst observation is that Advanced countries still represent the leadng technology under the two fictive scenarii and are not impacted\nScenario A Scenario B\nClub Efficiency Technology gap Efficiency Technology gap\nT E i t T G i t T E i t T G i t\nAdvanced 0.71 0.98 0.59 0.91 Followers 0.59 0.97 / / Emerging 0.55 0.87 / / Marginalized 0.53 0.86 0.53 0.86\nb e M t c e h t f o n\nt F m d N s t c f F\nfi e T\nn o i i o g\nt n s\n7\na t r c l g t g a o g\ni f q d t b n a a c e t\ny the switchers (average efficiency and technology gap switcher ffects are both equal to unity). A second observation is that the\narginalized technology is the still the worst one, and is negaively impacted by the switchers under both scenarii (average effiiency switcher effects less than one, and technology gap switcher ffect lar ger than one). These two stylized facts, while interesting, ave been found earlier before (see Table 5 ). What is interesting is o compare the effects of the switchers in the marginalized group or scenario A to the benchmark case, and to quantify the impact f the common technology of the Advanced and Followers in sce-\nario B.\nUnder scenario A, we see greater potential output expansion for he switchers from the Marginalized group that have joined the ollowers, but, at the same time, we see less technology improve-\nent. This may be explained by the fact that switchers that have\nefined the Emerging group are those with the best technology. ote that there are no switcher effects for the Emerging group ince that group does not exist at our starting year. We are able o evaluate the efficiency scores and the technology gaps of these ountries (see Table 7 ), and the switcher effects could be computed or time periods after 2010. Next, we do not see any impacts on the ollowers\u2019 group for scenario A.\nUnder scenario B, we see that the Followers have clearly beneted from joining the Advanced group: average efficiency switcher ffect is smaller (with respect to the benchmark scenario in able 5 ), i.e. more potential output expansion, and average tech-\nology gap switcher effect is smaller, i.e. more potential technolgy improvement. We may understand these results as a potential\nmitating effect. Similar observations are found for the switchers n the Marginalized group that have joined the Advanced technol-\ngy club. Note that there are no switcher effects for the Followers roup since that group no longer exists our ending year.\nAll in all, these two simple fictive scenarii show how our new echnique can deal with the creation and the destruction of techologies over time. We are still able to compute and quantify the witcher effects in these cases.\n. Conclusion\nNonparametric efficiency analysis is a technique used to evalute an entity by comparing its performance to that of other entiies. While this technique has gained popularity in the operations esearch literature and beyond, it presents two important shortomings. One of these is the assumption that entities use a simiar (but unknown) transformation process. In other words, heteroeneity amongst entities is not considered. The concept of metaechnology and meta-frontier have been suggested to deal with roup heterogeneity among entities for nonparametric efficiency nalysis. In brief, the meta-frontier is defined as the envelopment\nf the group-specific frontiers, and naturally allows us to distinuish between inefficiency and technology gap.\nMeta-frontier-based methodologies have been applied to a varous range of topics revealing the attractiveness of this concept or empirical research. In practice, the meta-frontier approach re-\nuires to partition entities into several groups, each capturing a istinct technology, and to allocate entities to each group. So far, his procedure has not provided enough flexibility since the numer of groups is fixed, and once the entity partitioning is made, o modification is possible. This is rather restrictive or even unrelistic as when dealing with panel data where many things usully change over time. For instance, new technology can be disovered, while other may disappear; and entities can imitate an xisting technology or adopt a new one. In this paper, we have exended the meta-frontier approach when technology switchers, i.e.\ne a h c e\ne g t n b c t i g e c\ns v T i w e T l i o t o i f i l s s u\nA\n( u\nT\nx\n\u2211\ns\n\u03bb\n\u03b8\ne\nT\nT a t n p\nA\na\nl C\n( F t b C i T t g n m\nB O G ( R L N b\nR\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nB\nB\nB\nB\nB\nB\nB\nB\nntities that adopt another technology over time, are considered, nd quantified the impacts of the switchers on the inefficiency beavior and the technology gap. In particular, we have defined the oncept of efficiency switcher effect and technology gap switcher ffect.\nWe applied our methodology to probably the most famous mpirical question involving technology switchers: the economic rowth convergence amongst countries. A popular option is to parition countries into groups/clubs where technology is homogeeous inside but not between clubs. While important efforts have een made to find coherent and consistent ways to define the lubs and the partitioning of countries amongst them, the literaure rarely evokes the impacts of the technology switchers. This s exactly the added value of our methodology to the economic rowth convergence: provide a simple nonparametric method to valuate the impact of the technology switchers on the technology lubs and on the countries\u2019 (in)efficiency behavior.\nOur concept of efficiency switcher effect and technology gap witcher effect can be extended in several directions. A first obious extension is to define the dynamic version of the concepts. o do so, an index can be defined (see e.g. the Malmquist index ntroduced by Caves et al., 1982). An important point would be\nhether the resulting index is circular or not. Most of the well-\nstablished concepts in the efficiency literature are not circular. his is simply explained by the observation that imposing circuarity requires extra assumption about the production process. This s not easy to defend in a nonparametric approach. Next, a sec-\nnd extension is to generalize the efficiency switcher effect and echnology gap switcher effect considering other orientations (e.g. utput or directional distance function). Also, providing a theoretcal framework about how to aggregate the efficiency switcher efect and technology gap switcher effect to obtain group averages s an important extension. Inspirations can be found in F\u00e4re & Zeenyuk (2003) and Walheer (2018a) that have provided aggregation chemes for the efficiency measurement and technology gap, repectively. A last idea for further research is to think about how\nsing the switcher effects to conduct second stage analysis.\nppendix A. linear programmings\nThe technical efficiency score of a particular entity operating at x , y ) with respect to the technology defined by S i t is computed sing the following linear programming: (LP-G) :\nE i t (y , x ) = min \u03b8 y \u03b8 \u2264 \u2211\ns \u2208 S i t\n\u03bbi st y i st\n\u2265 \u2211\ns \u2208 S i t\n\u03bbi st x i st\n\u2208 S i t\n\u03bbi st = 1\ni st \u2265 0 \u2265 0 .\nThe \u2018overall\u2019 technical efficiency score of a particular entity op-\nrating at (x , y ) is computed as follows:\nE t (y , x ) = max i =1 , ... ,I t\n{ T E i t (y , x ) }\nhe procedure is an enumeration algorithm as to obtain the \u2018overll\u2019 technical efficiency score, it is required to first use (LP-G) I t imes, once with respect to each group.
