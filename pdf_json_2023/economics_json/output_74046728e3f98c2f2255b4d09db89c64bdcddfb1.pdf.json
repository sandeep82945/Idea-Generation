Such ratios, however, normalize 19 the measure for differences in population size directly only under proportional increase of the 20 measure with population size. Violation of this assumption frequently leads to misleading 21 conclusions. To illustrate this issue, we compare per capita ratios with an approach based on 22 regression, which eliminates many of the problems with ratios and allows for a 23 straightforward data interpretation. The per capita measures in three global datasets (GDP, 24 COVID-related mortality, and CO2 production) systematically overestimate values in 25 countries with small populations, while countries with large populations tend to have 26 misleadingly low per capita ratios due to the large denominators. Despite their biases, 27 comparisons based on per capita ratios are still ubiquitous and are used for influential 28 recommendations by various global institutions.

            "text": "Social and environmental researchers often perform comparisons across countries (1,2) and 36 policy makers use such comparisons to take evidence-based action (3,4). Absolute values are 37 mostly not of much use because countries vary in their population size. For a meaningful 38 comparison, one needs to control for differences in population size. To address this issue, the 39 first choice is usually to calculate the ratio between the measure of interest and population 40 size and then compare the values of per capita measures among countries. This intuitively 41 appealing and seemingly straightforward procedure might, however, lead to misleading 42 conclusions (5). 43 Some of the problems with ratios have been identified already at the dawn of statistics 44 as a science (6,7). The major issue lies in the fact that the sole function yielding a constant 45 when divided by its argument and thus removing the effect of a denominator is a linear 46 function that goes through the origin of the coordinate system (figure 1). Per capita ratios can 47 be directly used for comparisons across countries only when the measure of interest increases 48 proportionally with population size. In all other cases, ratios ought to be interpreted with 49 extreme caution due to their various nonintuitive statistical properties including: i) a 50 frequently strong departure from normal distribution, ii) asymmetry with respect to changes 51 in the numerator and denominator, and iii) scaling with the denominator (figure 1). 52 Serious problems with ratios in comparative studies have been recognized in various 53 branches of life sciences including morphometry (8), evolutionary genetics (9), and 54 ecological stoichiometry (10), where the use of ratios has been largely abandoned and 55 replaced by more appropriate procedures (7,11). Nevertheless, global comparisons of various 56 aspects of economic performance, public health, or environmental impact are still frequently 57 based on per capita indicators (12,13). Measures standardized in this way suffer from the 58 abovementioned issues of ratios and frequently lead to worryingly misguided outcomes. 59\nGiven the global impact of these measures, we believe there is an urgent need for 60 alternatives. We propose an approach based on linear regression, which also provides simple 61 and appealing measures but does not suffer from many of the problems which ratios have. 62 2. Three case studies 63 We compare the per capita ratios and the approach based on linear regression by applying 64 them to three exemplar global comparisons in gross domestic product (GDP; data from 65 https://datacatalog.worldbank.org), COVID-19 related mortality (data from 66 https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries), and CO2 production (data from 67 https://www.worldometers.info/co2-emissions/). We selected these three variables because 68 they are widely used and affect political decisions in economy, health systems, environment 69 conservation, as well as other areas (13,14). Specialists in the relevant fields extensively 70 discuss the pros and cons of these measures. For instance, it is largely recognized that GDP 71 need not be the best proxy for country\u2019s economic performance and progress (15,16). 72 Nevertheless, it was shown that GDP per capita is closely correlated with the more 73 sophisticated measures such as Sustainable Development Goals index, Human Development 74 Index and Environmental Performance Index (17). Similarly, data on COVID-19-related 75 mortality may suffer from systematic inaccuracies related to differences in data gathering and 76 publication among countries (18,19). At present, we shall focus on the problems of per capita 77 comparisons and leave aside other questions concerning the suitability of particular measures 78 (for a discussion see (16,20)). 79 The per capita expressions in all three measures (GDP, COVID-19 mortality, CO2 80 production) show a pattern typical of many ratios. Firstly, the ratios substantially deviate 81 from normal distribution (electronic supplementary material figure S1). The mean per capita 82 value, while often used to describe the central tendency, is therefore not an informative 83 representative of the dataset. Secondly, the ratios exhibit enormous variability among 84\ncountries with small populations; this variability then sharply decreases with countries\u2019 85 increasing population size (figure 2). Small changes in population size thus have 86 disproportionately larger effects in countries with small populations. Thirdly, the GDP and 87 the COVID-19 related mortality data show a strong negative correlation with population size 88 (Spearman\u2019s \u2374 = -0.32, p < 0.00001, and \u2374 = -0.20, p < 0.004, respectively). The data on GDP 89 and COVID-19 related mortality thus do not increase proportionally with population size and 90 the per capita ratios do not adequately standardize for differences in population size. This is 91 further reflected in a strong correlation between country ranking according to per capita GDP 92 and per capita COVID-19 deaths rates on the one hand and population size on the other hand 93 (Spearman\u2019s \u2374 = 0.32, p = 0.000002, and \u2374 = 0.20, p = 0.004, respectively, figure 3). In 94 contrast, the correlation between per capita CO2 emissions and population size is not 95 statistically significant (\u2374 = -0.11, p = 0.10). Consequently, the correlation between a ranking 96 based on per capita CO2 emissions and log-transformed population size is not statistically 97 significant (\u2374 = 0.09, p = 0.21). Nevertheless, the shifts in per capita ratios in CO2 emissions 98 demonstrate a strong asymmetry with shifts in population size (electronic supplementary 99\nmaterial figure S1), suggesting that the per capita ratio is not an optimal index for this 100 measure either. 101 The assumption of proportionality of a measure to the population size is rarely tested 102 and even less frequently met. Researchers who use the per capita ratio to normalize a 103 measure to population size should be aware that a violation of the proportionality assumption 104 leads to severe biases when per capita ratios are used for direct comparisons among 105 countries. A correct approach to global comparisons should not be based on unrealistic and 106 often violated assumptions: it should consider the general trend of the data. We cannot stress 107 enough that before using any analytical technique, one should carefully check the trends in a 108 given dataset including its distribution, central tendency, and effect of outliers. The properties 109\nof data one ought to consider carefully are well-known and include non-linearity, 110 homoscedasticity, and leverage (7). 111 In all three examples analyzed here, the linear function of log10-transformed measure 112 to log10-transformed population size describes the general trend well. These functions explain 113 65%, 59%, and 68% of total variance, demonstrating that total GDP, COVID-related 114 mortality, and CO2 production, respectively, scale with population size, and that a 115 standardization for population size is necessary for comparisons. The addition of a quadratic 116 term to each of these relationships did not significantly improve the model\u2019s explanatory 117 power (for details, see electronic supplementary material). We thus further neglect a slight 118 nonlinearity in the log-log relationships. 119 Importantly, these linear approximations on the log-log scale explain the behaviour of 120 the per capita ratios very well. To illustrate it, we back-transformed the linear functions of 121 logarithmically transformed values and depicted the ratios of values predicted by the back-122 transformed power functions for a given population size (figure 2). The predicted per capita 123 measures approach infinity as the population size approaches zero, which is responsible for 124 the strong asymmetry in per capita ratios. Most notably, due to the steepness of the functions 125 as they approach zero, a small shift in the population size or the measure of interest in 126 countries with a small population leads to an enormous shift in the per capita ratio. In 127 contrast, even a large change in population size or the measure of interest in countries with 128 large populations has little effect on the per capita ratios and their ratios are moreover in 129 general relatively low. Nevertheless, regardless of the precise underlying function, in all 130 cases the per capita ratios are clearly inappropriate direct standardization for differences in 131 population size among countries. 132 3. Differences in country ranking between the two approaches 133 Instead of the highly problematic per capita ratios for comparison among countries, one may 134\nemploy residuals from the log-log linear regression. These residuals have a straightforward 135 interpretation: their values +1.0 and -1.0 correspond to ten times higher and ten times lower 136 values of a measure in comparison to the value expected for a country of a particular 137 population size (residual 0). The similarities and differences between the per capita approach 138 and the regression approach can be exemplified by comparing the rankings of individual 139 countries in a particular measure. Rankings based on the two approaches were in all three 140 measures highly correlated, which reflects the enormous differences among countries (figure 141 3), but we also found some important differences between the rankings. None of the rankings 142 based on the linear regression approach correlated with the population size, which is exactly 143 what one would expect from a procedure standardizing for differences in population size. The 144 direction of shifts in the rankings in all three measures highly correlated with country 145 population sizes (figure 3), which is what one would expect from the relationship between 146 per capita ratio and population size (figure 2). In particular it can be expected that some 147 small countries will have misleadingly large ratios because of the small denominator 148 (population size), while large countries will have misleadingly low ratios due to large 149 denominators substantially decreasing their metrics. We recorded the largest change in the 150 GDP ranking relative to population size in Nauru, which moved 66 positions down, while 151 India moved 64 positions up in the ranking based on the regression approach as compared to 152 the per capita measures (electronic supplementary material table S1). In fact, all 29 countries 153 with population above 50 million moved up (on average 29 positions, which is considerable). 154 The effect of large denominators on the per capita ratio can be exemplified in China and 155 India, the two most populous countries in the world. According to the GDP per capita 156 measure, both are within a broad middle of the ranking: China ranks 78th and India even 157 162nd among 206 countries. But when we compare countries without the bias introduced by 158 the behaviour of ratios, India (with residual -0.04) reaches 91% of GDP expected for a 159\ncountry of its population size, and China (residual 0.70) has an over five times higher GDP 160 than predicted for a country of its population size. In ranking according to residuals, India is 161 around the middle of the ranking (98th place), while China is among the 17% of highest-162 scoring countries (34th place). Also, we can notice that only small population countries are 163 represented in the top ten of the GDP ranking according to per capita ratios, while in ranking 164 according to residuals, the top ten countries are much more balanced with respect to their 165 population size (figure 4). 166 Similarly as for the GDP, three countries of small population size (Gibraltar, San 167 Marino, and Liechtenstein) versus two countries with large population (Indonesia and India) 168 showed the largest change in COVID-related mortality rankings, with the small countries 169 moving up (in terms of higher mortality) and the large ones down (electronic supplementary 170 material table S2). Two countries with a large population (USA and Brazil), where the 171 situation with COVID-related mortality was apparently dramatic (21,22), took in the 172 regression-based ranking the second and the third position (in highest morality) right after 173 Peru, where COVID-related mortality was so disastrous (23) that it headed the rankings based 174 on both approaches. Again, the much lower positions of USA and Brazil in the per capita 175 ranking should be attributed to their large population size, that is, the large denominator in 176 the calculation of the per capita ratio. 177 In CO2 emission ranking, the situation was analogous but the changes in ranking were 178 smaller. Still, the most notable movements between the rankings in the opposite directions 179 made Palau and Seychelles, which moved down, versus India and Brazil, which moved up 180 (electronic supplementary material table S3). Countries with population over 50 million 181 inhabitants moved on average 7 positions up, meaning their production of CO2 emissions 182 standardized for population size is in a global comparison comparatively much higher than 183 one would assume based on the per capita ranking. 184\n4. Conclusions 185 We are not the first to draw attention to the biases introduced by the use of ratios and the 186 need for alternatives. For instance, Ranta et al. (11) claimed that a regression-based approach 187 amounts to reinventing the wheel in their instructive demonstration of problems with ratios in 188 comparisons of sexual size dimorphism among animals. Still, the use of per capita measures, 189 an exemplary case of ratios, remains ubiquitous. For instance, the World Bank classifies the 190 world\u2019s economies in four income groups \u2013 low, lower-middle, upper-middle, and high-191 income countries \u2013 based on per capita gross national income. Therefore, we feel compelled 192 to stress that a continued use of per capita measures is not only of a limited informative value 193 but can result in misleading conclusions and cause extensive damage when employed as 194 evidence for policy actions. The alternative offered here, the regression-based approaches, are 195 computationally simple and can be flexibly adjusted for general trends in data. The 196 interpretation of such comparisons is straightforward, and the results can be thus easily 197 communicated to the general public. We believe that policy makers, practitioners, and 198 influential organizations, such as the Food and Agriculture Organization (24), the World 199 Health Organization (25), World Bank (14), International Monetary Fund (26), Eurostat (27), 200 and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (28) as well as various 201 widely used information sources such as Wikipedia (29), could adopt it easily and abandon 202 the per capita approach, which appears to standardize well for a population size but in fact 203 provides distorted insights. 204 205 Authors\u2019 contributions 206 Both authors contributed to the conception of the study, manuscript preparation and its final 207 revision.
