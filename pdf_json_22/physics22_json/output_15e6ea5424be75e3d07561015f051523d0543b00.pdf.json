INTRODUCTION\nMagnetic skyrmions have been receiving increasing attention in the last decades. Since the initial theoretical studies and predictions on the fundamental and promising application properties of these \u201ctopologically protected\u201d solitons [1\u20133], great efforts have been placed in material development for the experimental stabilization of skyrmions. The earliest experimental observations were in B20 compounds, where the bulk Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) promotes the formation of Bloch skyrmions [4\u20139]. Later, an increased effort has been devoted to thin films and heterostructures where ferromagnetic layers (FM) are coupled with heavy metals (HM) which are characterized by interfacial DMI (IDMI) [10]. These systems allow skyrmions to be stabilized at room temperature, which is a fundamental requirement for practical applications. Lately, skyrmions have been reported in a variety of thin film materials, including HM/single-layer FM/oxide [11\u201313], HM1/FM/HM2 multilayers [14\u201321], HM/ferrimagnet/oxide multilayers [22,23], synthetic antiferromagnets (SAFs) [24\u201326], as well as bulk systems [27,28]. The standard approach to manipulate skyrmions is by electrical currents through the conventional spin-orbit torques (SOT) [13,15,16,29\u201331]. However, alternative methods have been proposed, such as by external field [32,33] and perpendicular anisotropy [34] gradients as well as thermal gradients [35,36]. The manipulation by thermal gradients is particularly promising due to its low energy consumption, and is at the basis of a recent research direction named SkyrmionCaloritronics [35]. Thermal fluctuations have also been predicted to induce internal deformations, breathing excitations, and Brownian diffusion [37\u201341]. The latter has recently been experimentally observed and exploited in a low pinning material to design a reshuffle device for probabilistic computing [42]. Moreover, experiments have shown unidirectional diffusion of skyrmions in thermal gradients, where they moved from hot to cold regions [35]. This observation has been explained through the combination of repulsive forces between skyrmions, thermal SOTs [43], magnonic spin torques [44,45] as well as entropic forces. Recently, Gong et al. [46] proposed the existence of spin-currents generated by thermal gradients to explain the observed skyrmion motion and concluded that skyrmions can move in either direction of the temperature gradient depending on the material parameters. We have previously demonstrated the influence of thermal fluctuations on skyrmion stationary properties in single layers [40], through variations of the magnetic parameters (exchange, interfacial DMI, perpendicular anisotropy constants) whose scaling relations were obtained by atomistic calculations. However, that study did not consider the influence of thermal fluctuations on the skyrmion dynamical properties. Moreover, in a previous study [47] performed numerically and within the Thiele\u2019s formalism [48], we have shown that a linear gradient of the perpendicular anisotropy\ngenerates skyrmion motion in a single-layer FM. We observed that the skyrmion exhibits a Hall effect with a major component of the velocity along the direction perpendicular to the anisotropy gradient, and a smaller velocity component (damping-dependent) in the same direction of the current. Furthermore, the adiabatic adjustment of the skyrmion size in the anisotropy gradient produces a uniform acceleration. In this work, we study the effects of thermal gradients on skyrmion motion in different systems (single-layer FM with IDMI, multilayer, and SAF) inspired by the experimental results of Ref. [35] and from a fundamental point of view. We consider the previously obtained 2D scaling relations to analyze the thermal gradient-driven skyrmion motion in a single-layer with IDMI. Using atomistic simulations, we also compute the characteristic scaling relations for magnetic multilayers where several atomic layers are taken into account and the DMI is induced at both ferromagnet interfaces (for example Pt/FeCo/Ir [17,49] can be used as the active trilayer in N repetitions for a multilayer stack) and investigate the thermal gradient-driven motion of a skyrmion in these systems. In particular, we focus on two effects: the entropic torque and magnonic torque. The first one, already studied for domain walls [50], is analyzed in a deterministic scenario and is based on thermodynamic phenomena. It generates a skyrmion motion towards the region where its free energy is minimized. The second one occurs in a stochastic framework where thermal spin-waves propagating from the hot to the cold region exert a torque on skyrmions by moving them in the opposite direction \u2013 from cold to hot [45]. We observe that, when driven by the entropic torque, skyrmions in single layers move from the cold to the hot region with a finite skyrmion Hall angle, while in multilayers they move in the opposite direction (from hot to cold region). The numerical results are corroborated by a generalized Thiele\u2019s equation developed for this scenario, taking into account variations of the skyrmion size along its trajectory. Moreover, we show that the skyrmion Hall angle is completely suppressed in SAFs, similarly to the current-driven skyrmions [51\u201353]. The effect of the magnonic torque agrees with previous predictions [45] and induces the skyrmion motion towards the hotter region regardless the system. Our results have fundamental implications in the future development of skyrmionic devices combining thermal gradients and SOTs where the proper temperature dependence of the parameters should be taken into account. In addition, our work extends the application of controlled skyrmion motion to electric insulators and contributes to the design of waste heat recovery methods taking advantage of the thermal-driven skyrmion nucleation and shifting, promoting the field of SkyrmionCaloritronics.\nII. THEORETICAL MODELS\nA. Micromagnetic simulations The micromagnetic computations were performed with a state-of-the-art micromagnetic solver, PETASPIN, which uses the Adams-Bashforth [54,55] method to numerically integrate the LandauLifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation:\n( ) G d d\nd d     = \u2212  +     eff m m m h m (1)\nwhere G is the Gilbert damping, sM/Mm = is the normalized magnetization vector, and\n0 sM t = is the dimensionless time, with 0 being the gyromagnetic ratio, and sM the saturation\nmagnetization. effh is the effective magnetic field, which includes the exchange (A), interfacial DMI (IDMI D), uniaxial anisotropy (Ku), magnetostatic, and external fields (Hext) [21,56]. We simulated a squared 1200 nm x 1200 nm sample for the single-layer FM, and a squared 900 nm x 900 nm for the multilayer. We include the change in saturation magnetization with temperature as\n( ) ( )S S lim\n0 1 T\nM T M T     = \u2212      with ( )S 0M being the saturation magnetization of the ferromagnet at\nzero temperature, 1.5 = and limT = 1120 K is the Curie temperature [57\u201359]. We simulated three different systems: single-layer FM with IDMI, multilayer with 5 FM repetitions, and SAF. The parameters at zero temperature used for each of them are listed in Table I, while further details of the micromagnetic model can be found in the Supplemental Note 1 [60].\nFor the macroscopic parameters, in a single-layer FM with IDMI, we used the 2D scaling relations from our previous work [40] which are as follows:\n( ) ( ) ( )0A T A m T = , ( ) ( ) ( )0D T D m T = , ( ) ( ) ( )0u uK T K m T = , (2)\nwhere 1.5 = = , 3.0 = , and ( ) ( ) ( )S S 0m T M T M= . For the Pt/FeCo/Ir trilayer, the scaling relations\nwere evaluated by atomistic simulations, as shown below. In the micromagnetic simulations, we used a linear thermal gradient from 100 K to 300 K along the x-direction. The minimum (maximum) value is considered on the left (right) side of the sample, where the corresponding maximum (minimum) value of the magnetic parameters are calculated from the scaling relations.\nB. Atomistic Simulations We used atomistic spin simulations to calculate the temperature dependence of magnetic parameters using the technique developed in Ref. [40]. We model the thin film as an FCC (111) lattice with 2 layers of Fe (adjacent to Ir) 1 layer of 50:50 mixed Fe and Co and then 2 layers of Co (adjacent to Pt). The Hamiltonian is given by\n( )ij i j ij i j ij zi zj ij ij ij H J K S S       =  +   \u2212  S S D S S (3)\nwhere the first term is the isotropic exchange, the second is the DMI which only occurs at the Ir-Fe and Co-Pt interfaces and the third is the two-ion anisotropy which acts only at the Co-Pt interface. In this finite thickness film, the IDMI (and anisotropy) is only present at the Ir-Fe and Co-Pt interface layers whereas the exchange is present in and between all layers. The angle brackets, <ij>, denote that we only consider nearest neighbors. We parametrize the exchange anisotropy and DMI constants using values from ab initio calculations in Ref. [17] ( ) 24.2meVijJ Fe Fe\u2212 = ,\n( ) 29.0meVijJ Co Co\u2212 = , ( ) 26.6meVijJ Fe Co\u2212 = , ( ) 0.854meVijD Fe Ir\u2212 = \u2212 ,\n( ) 1.281meVijD Co Pt\u2212 = , ( ) 0.59meVijK Co Co\u2212 = and used magnetic moments ( ) 1.7 BFe =\nand ( ) 1.3 BCo = [62]. The temperature dependence of the anisotropy was calculated using constrained Monte Carlo method [63]. The temperature dependence of exchange stiffness and IDMI was calculated from the softening [64] and shifting asymmetry of the spin wave spectrum. The spectrum contains five bands and we fitted the lowest band in the low k-limit (see supplementary information of Ref. [40] for details of the technique). We express the scaling relations in terms of the magnetization of the whole thin film, which corresponds to what is most accessible experimentally and is used in micromagnetic simulations for single layers. We found that the Ir/FeCo/Pt trilayer has the scaling parameters 1.7 = , 2.0 = and\n2.5 = . This is different from in a 2D (atomic monolayer) system where the \u03b1 and \u03b2 parameters are found to be identical [40,65]. Thus,  = and  = are modified because their temperature\ndependence is dominated by spin fluctuations at interfaces which are different from the bulk where there is a different number of neighboring spins. This implies that, by changing the properties of the multilayer, including heavy metal materials and geometry, it is possible to tune the exponents  = and\n =. We note, however, that  = is closer to the bulk value ( )1.8 = [66] than in the 2D case ( )1.5 =\ndue to the finite thickness of the model considered. The exchange and DMI are also sensitive to different types of spin fluctuation, with A being mostly dependent on in-plane fluctuations whilst D is sensitive also to the out-of-plane fluctuations which are different in the thicker and asymmetric system compared to the 2D case [65]. We emphasize, therefore, that the thickness of the film and the interface properties play an important role overall on the temperature dependence of the material parameters.\nC. Generalized Thiele\u2019s equation Despite the complex dynamics of the LLG Eq. (1), magnetic skyrmions are collective excitation states which behave as particle-like objects with reduced degrees of freedom. This physical behavior is captured by the Thiele\u2019s equation [48,67,68] which describes the motion of rigid magnetic textures. In order to include observed changes in the skyrmion size, we consider an adiabatic evolution of the skyrmion size such that at each instant the skyrmion motion is approximately described as a rigid object and the Thiele approach is still valid. It is important to notice, however, that within the range of material parameters and temperature gradient used in this manuscript, the skyrmion radius is approximately constant (see Supplemental Note 2 [60]). Within this approximation, the motion of the skyrmion at each instant is given by\n( ) ( ) ( ), , ,d d     = \u2212  m x v x m x (4)\nwhere \u02c6 \u02c6x yv v= +v x y is the velocity of the skyrmion center. By substituting Eq. (4) into Eq. (1) and\nprojecting along im m , with ,i x y= , we obtain a generalized Thiele equation from which we derive the velocity of the skyrmion as\n( )22 2 4 4 G ex x x\nG ex\nD F v\nD    = \u2212 + and ( )22 2 4 4 x y\nG ex\nF v\nD    = \u2212 + , (5)\nwhere ( ) ( )2 2ex x x y yD d x d x=   =   m m m m is the viscosity tensor components for a radially\nsymmetric skyrmion, and x xF V= \u2212 , with ( )2( ') ( ', ) ( , )V d x  =  effx m x h x , is the force due to a\ngradient in the effective field along the x-axis. The size of the skyrmion, however, influences exD and\nx F . The non-vanishing component yv of the velocity perpendicular to the force xF is due to the\nMagnus force experienced by the skyrmion and is associated with its topological charge [69]. Moreover, the velocity xv along xF is due to the influence of damping ( ) G d d\nd d     = \u2212  +     m m .\nIn the presence of a thermal gradient (expressed as the gradient of magnetic parameters) along the x-\ndirection, we obtain a dependence of the effective field effh on the x-coordinate which in turn produces a motion of the skyrmion. For sufficiently large skyrmions (skyrmion radius R bigger than\ndomain wall width / effA K = ), we can assume the following ansatz\n( ) ( )( )( )arccos 2arctan R rzm R r e \u2212= , with ( ) 201/ 2 /eff SK M =  , [40], and then we have that, in the limit of large skyrmions,\n22 2DW S TV R M H R = + (6)\nHere 4DW effAK D  \u2212 is the domain wall energy density [40,67,70,71]. Notice that, for a\nmagnetization saturation varying along the sample, the magnetostatic field cannot be fully\nincorporated into the renormalization via the effective anisotropy effK , and we included a\ncontribution to the external field 0T z SH H b M= \u2212 , b depend on the properties of the film (for details see Supplemental Note 2 [60]). Thus, a gradient in temperature produces position-dependent\nmaterial parameters A, D, Ku and MS, as well as, within an adiabatic approximation, a positiondependent size of the skyrmion and generates the motion of the skyrmion with a non-constant\nvelocity. Furthermore, we emphasize that the change in the saturation magnetization sM along the film due to the temperature gradient also produces a stray field gradient. This effect can be incorporated into the effective anisotropy (thin-film approximation) for the case of the single layer, however the thin-film approximation does not hold for the multilayer. Therefore, in the Thiele\u2019s equation for the multilayer, the non-negligible stray field gradient is considered through a perpendicular external field gradient.\nIII. RESULTS\nA. Single-layer FM and multilayer Figure 1 shows the main result of this work which is obtained from deterministic micromagnetic simulations when a linear gradient of temperature is considered for the single-layer FM and the multilayer. Surprisingly, the trajectory of the skyrmion (here we consider the position of the skyrmion\ngiven by the x-y position of the skyrmion core, calculated as the geometrical center of the circular\nregion enclosed within 0zm  ), is qualitatively opposite for the two cases. In the single-layer FM (Fig. 1(a)), the skyrmion moves with positive velocities in the x- and y-directions, i.e., towards the region with higher temperature. Whereas, in the multilayer case (Fig. 1(b)), it has negative velocities, with respect to the x- and y-directions, i.e. it moves towards the colder region. The latter is a particularly interesting outcome due to the qualitative agreement with the experimental observations of skyrmion motion driven by linear thermal gradients in magnetic multilayers (see Fig. 3a in Ref. [35]). To understand the origin of such a different behavior, we performed a detailed analysis combining full numerical simulations and Thiele\u2019s equation.\nWhen considering a deterministic approach with linear gradient of the micromagnetic parameters, the skyrmion moves towards the parameters region where its energy is minimized. In particular, in this work, the energy minimization as a function of temperature leads the skyrmion radius to expand. Therefore, the effect that each micromagnetic parameter gradient has on the skyrmion motion can be straightforwardly deduced since in this case it will move towards the region where the local value of the parameter favors the existence of a larger skyrmion. To confirm the previous qualitative argument, we performed systematic simulations in which the gradients of the parameters were considered independently both in the single-layer FM and multilayer. The results are summarized in Table II, while the different trajectories are shown in the Supplemental Note 3 [60]. The perpendicular anisotropy and exchange parameters gradients promote the skyrmion motion to the region where those parameters are smaller, therefore from the cold to the hot region. On the contrary, the MS\n(magnetostatic field), D and the combination of MS and A gradients, move the skyrmion to the region where those parameters are larger, thus from the hot to the cold region. This can be understood from Eq.(6) and directly from the domain wall energy density DW [70,72]. It is clear that the skyrmion\nenergy increases as A and K increase, while it decreases for higher SM and D (the scenario is more complicated for the multilayer, as discussed below).\nWhen considering the combinations of all parameters gradient due to a thermal gradient, the scenario becomes complex and the final effect on skyrmion motion depends on their values. Figure 1 suggests that the direction of skyrmion motion results from which of the antagonistic effects (A and Ku, or IDMI and MS) is dominant. First, we focus on the single-layer FM. Figure 1(a) entails that the 2D scaling relations lead to the dominance of A and Ku parameters over IDMI and MS. To better understand and control this behavior, we must consider two degrees of freedom: (i) the change of the scaling exponents, and (ii) different zero temperature values of the magnetic parameters. We focus on the IDMI scaling relation since the value of the IDMI can be easily tuned by modifying the materials, i.e., using different heavy metals and modifying their thickness [73], at the ferromagnetic interfaces (see section II.B) without a significant change of other material parameters. By fixing the scaled values of the other parameters as well as the zero temperature value of the IDMI, we carry out a systematic study of the skyrmion trajectory as a function of the scaling exponent  (the range of values for  were chosen such that\nthe radially symmetric skyrmions were still stable). Figure 2(a) shows the results where, for 1.5 < \n< 2.7, the skyrmions preserves its motion towards the hot region, similarly to Fig. 1(a), whereas, in\nthe range 2.8 <  < 4.0, the motion is reversed and the skyrmion moves towards the cold region. In\nother words, there exists a threshold value of the exponent  which determines the motion of the\nskyrmion to the cold region, albeit the DMI should decay with magnetization quite fast. Figure 2(b) illustrates the skyrmion motion when we fixed two values of 4.0 = and 1.5, respectively\nfor the left and right side of the figure, together with the scaled values of the other parameters and changed the zero-temperature value of the IDMI, ( )0D . In both cases, the skyrmion trajectory is\nbarely affected by ( )0D . Therefore, we conclude that a strategy to control the direction of the\nskyrmion motion is to properly tune the scaling exponent of the IDMI parameter (see section II.B).\nWe also performed a systematic study on the effect of the magnitude of the thermal gradient on the skyrmion velocity, which increases with the gradient as expected (see Supplemental Note 4 [60]).\nOnce the behavior in the single layer is fully understood, we proceed with the magnetic\nmultilayer to understand the source of the skyrmion motion towards the colder region. In magnetic multilayers, skyrmions are characterized by an additional degree of freedom linked to the thicknessdependent chirality [21,49,74] which can be modified by tuning the IDMI parameter. It is well-\ndocumented that an increase of the IDMI parameter on the hybrid skyrmion profile shifts the central Bloch skyrmion towards one of the most external layers, according to the IDMI sign [21,74]. Hence, we expect that, when considering a linear variation of D, the hybrid skyrmion profile changes along the gradient. It is important to investigate whether this effect influences the skyrmion trajectory. Thus, we fixed the IDMI gradient from 0 to \u2013 2 mJ/m2, such that in the center of the sample \u2013 corresponding to the x-y plane \u2013 the IDMI is given by 21.0mJ/mD = \u2212 . In this case, we consider an IDMI gradient.\nAt zero IDMI, static simulations show a symmetric hybrid skyrmion (see Supplemental Note 1 [60]), where the Bloch skyrmion is exactly in the middle layer.\nFigure 3(a) depicts the hybrid skyrmion trajectory due to the IDMI gradient. We notice a\nchange of slope when the x-position is around 540 nm. To understand the origin of such a change, we compute the helicity of the skyrmion, i.e., the in-plane angle of the magnetization vector at the boundary of the skyrmion (region where m 0z = ) as illustrated in the inset of Fig. 3(b). An angle of 90\u00b0 corresponds to a Bloch skyrmion, while an angle of 0\u00b0 (180\u00b0) corresponds to a N\u00e9el skyrmion. The initial hybrid skyrmion is placed at the center of the sample in the x-y plane, where we expect the finite value of D to promote the shift of the Bloch skyrmion downward. This is evident from the crosssection S1. Therefore, we calculate the angle for the skyrmion placed in the 2nd layer of the 5-repeats multilayer. The initial angle is about 107\u00b0 in Fig. 3(b), larger than 90\u00b0 still due to the finite value of D which tilts the Bloch chirality towards a N\u00e9el inward chirality. As the skyrmion moves towards larger values of |D|, the angle tends to approach 180\u00b0, which implies that the Bloch skyrmion has been shifted more downward being replaced by a N\u00e9el skyrmion with inward chirality. Our outcomes are also confirmed by the cross-sectional views S2-S5 in Fig. 3. By comparing the change of the slope in Fig. 3(a) with the corresponding angle in Fig. 3(b), we can conclude that the variation of the trajectory originates from the change of the thickness-dependent chirality of the hybrid skyrmion. This finding represents the second main result of this work.\nHowever, the change of the skyrmion profile and helicity is not enough to justify the different behaviors observed between the single-layer FM and the multilayer. Indeed, to exclude these effects, we performed a simulation fixing the thickness-dependent chirality during the motion, and still observed the skyrmion motion in the multilayer system towards the colder region. Beyond the DMI contribution, another important factor which influences the dynamics in the two systems are the different scaling exponents. As a \u201cnumerical experiment\u201d, we performed a micromagnetic simulation with a single-layer, similar to the one in Fig. 1(a), and used the scaling relations obtained for the multilayer system (see section II.B). In this simulation, we observed that the N\u00e9el skyrmion moves towards the colder region (Fig. 4(a)), similarly to the hybrid skyrmion in multilayers. This unequivocally confirms the crucial role of the scaling relations that, for multilayers, leads to the dominance of the effect of the IDMI over the other parameters.\nTo corroborate our analysis in the single-layer FM simulations, we verified the behavior by\nusing the Thiele\u2019s equation (see Section II.C). Figure 4(b) and (c) show the skyrmion trajectory within the Thiele formalism for the single-layer FM and multilayer systems, respectively, where the skyrmion behavior is in excellent agreement with the full micromagnetic simulations. Notice that, the enhancement of the external field term proportional to 0 sM (see Eq. (6)) is not relevant for the skyrmion trajectory for the single-layer scaling relations while it is essential for multilayer case. In fact, as a further \u201cnumerical experiment\u201d we performed a micromagnetic simulation with a single layer and scaling relations of the multilayer but without considering the extra contribution to the external field (i.e., 0b = ). The skyrmion now changes direction and moves to the hotter region, likewise the case of the single-layer FM. This outcome points out that the gradient of the magnetostatic field in multilayers has a crucial effect in determining the skyrmion motion towards the colder region. For a detailed discussion on the forces for each case according to the Thiele formalism see the Supplemental Note 2 [60]. Once the influence of the entropic torques were well-understood, we analyzed the effect of the magnonic torque. We performed stochastic micromagnetic simulations (see Supplemental Note 5 [60]) with a linear thermal field [75,76] gradient from 0 to 100 K. The skyrmion moves towards the hot region, similarly to Fig. 1(a) and to previous reports [45], but with a stochastic dispersion of the Hall angle around its average value due to thermal fluctuations. These results are similar even for the case when magnonic torque and entropic torque (scaling relations of the parameters) are considered simultaneously."

            "text": "In a SAF, two skyrmions of opposite topological charges are antiferromagnetically coupled via the interlayer exchange coupling [52,77\u201379], and a vanishing skyrmion Hall effect is achieved [51,52,80]. Therefore, we expect the linear gradient-driven skyrmion motion to occur only in the direction of the gradients (x-axis). This can be explained by the fact that in this case, the two coupled skyrmions experience Magnus forces of same magnitude in opposite directions, such that the total net force perpendicular to perturbation vanishes, as in the case of spin-current-driven antiferromagnetic N\u00e9el skyrmions [51]. Our calculations show that the results obtained above on ferromagnetic systems are still valid for SAFs, where, according to the material choice, either single layer or multilayer scaling relations can be used. In the following, we show only the results with scaling relation of the multilayer.\nFigure 5(a) and (b) show the motion direction due to the gradients IDMI, SM , or thermal gradients, while Figs. 5(c) and (d) show the opposite direction of motion due to Ku or A gradients. In all the cases, the skyrmion is characterized by a zero Hall angle, but the entropic torque due to the thermal gradients (Fig. 5(a) and (b)) promotes the motion towards the cold region. Here, notice that the magnetostatic field gradient does not play any role because the SAF system has no stray field.\nFIG. 5: (a) - (b) Skyrmion trajectory under a linear gradient of IDMI (or MS or thermal gradient), in the top layer and in the bottom layer of the SAF, respectively.

SUMMARY AND CONLUSIONS\nIn summary, we analyzed the effect of linear thermal gradients on the skyrmion motion in single and multilayered thin films with interfacial DMI parameter in different systems through micromagnetic simulations and the Thiele formalism. We focused on the role of the entropic and magnonic torques. The former originates from the temperature dependence of the magnetic parameters, which scale with temperature. We observed opposite skyrmion motion directions in a single-layer FM and a multilayer. In the single-layer case, the skyrmion moves to the hotter region, whereas, in the multilayer case, the skyrmion moves towards the colder region, in qualitative agreement with experimental results [35]. We attributed this difference to the distinct scaling relations characterizing the two systems, and to\nthe existence of a magnetostatic field gradient linked to the variation of SM which cannot be neglected in magnetic multilayers. We also showed that the magnonic torque promotes the skyrmion motion towards the hotter region with stochastic dispersion of the trajectories around averaged Hall angle. In a SAF, the skyrmion motion due to the entropic torque occurs with a zero Hall angle towards either the colder or the hotter region according to the scaling relations considered. Our results show the importance of the design of proper temperature dependence of the magnetic parameters and can have a fundamental impact in the future development and design of skyrmion devices in the field of Skyrmion-Caloritronics."

            "text": "A particular case of magnetic multilayer is a SAF [80]. Its simplest version consists of two FM layers separated by a metallic spacer which promotes an antiparallel alignment of the two FMs magnetization vectors owed to the interlayer exchange coupling [77-79,52] . We have simulated a square 1200 nm x 1200 nm sample with 2 FM repetitions. Each FM is 1 nm thick, and it is separated by 1 nm thick non-magnetic layer from the other. The micromagnetic parameters at zero temperature\nare the following: (0) 770 A/mSM k= , exchange constant (0) 20 pJ/mA = , interfacial DMI (IDMI) constant 2(0) 2.5 J/mD m= , perpendicular anisotropy constant 3(0) 0.60MJ/m u K = , and the antiferromagnetic interlayer exchange coupling constant 4 25 J/mexA e\u2212= \u2212 [78,52,53]. As for the single\nlayer and multilayer, also for the SAF we analyze the effect of linear gradients of the parameters along the x-axis. We consider the following linear gradient disconnected from the thermal effects, after a systematic study of the skyrmion stability on each parameter variation: Ku from 0.58 to 30.64MJ/m , A from 18 to 30 pJ/m ; MS from 700 to 800kA/m ; D from 2.2 to 22.6mJ/m .\nSupplemental Note 2 \u2013 Generalized Thiele\u2019s equation\nTo obtain the Generalized Thiele equation, we consider the LLG equation [54]\n( ) G d d\nd d     = \u2212  +     eff m m m h m , (S2.1)\nwhere m is the unitary magnetization direction, effh is the effective magnetic field and G is the Gilbert damping term. Following the Thiele method [48,67], we assume that the dynamical evolution of the magnetization is given by\n( ) ( ) ( ), , ,d d     = \u2212  m x v x m x . (S2.2)\nHere, we assume that the skyrmion radius evolves adiabatically, such that at every instant  , it assumes an equilibrium skyrmion configuration for the parameters at x . By projecting the LLG equation into ( )im m , where ,i x y= and integrating over the surface we obtain\n( )( ) ( ) ( )2 2 2 0i i j i G i i jv d x d x H v d x   +  +   =  m m m m m . (S2.3) Here we used that the effective magnetic field is given by (1/ )SM H = \u2212effh m , where SM is the magnetization saturation and H is the free energy density, ( ) ( )( )2 2 \u02c6eff z S extH A K m D z M=  \u2212 +    + m m m H m . (S2.4) The first term corresponds to the exchange stiffness, the second is the easy axis anisotropy along z\u0302 , the third is the interfacial DMI and the last term is the coupling with the external magnetic field.\nNotice that we include the stray field as contributions to the effective anisotropy, 20 2eff u S\nK K M  = \u2212\nand a contribution to the external field ( )T ext strayH H H + m . Moreover, we have that\n( )( )2 4i j zijd x    = m m m , where zij is the total antisymmetric tensor, and we define the viscosity tensor as ( )2,ex ij i jD d x=   m m . For a skyrmion configuration, we considered the magnetization given by the ansatz\n( ) ( )( )( )arccos 2arctan R rzm R r e \u2212= , with ( ) 201/ 2 /eff SK M =  substituted on H and integrated over the surface to get the skyrmion energy as\n( )2 202 2 2 eff S ext S R\nV A K R DR M H R M R a bR R      = + +  \u2212 + \u2212 +     , (S2.5)\nwhere a and b are constants and depends on the geometry of the sample. Assuming that\n4 DW eff AK D  \u2212 , 20DW SM a  and in the limit of large radius R  from Eq. (S2.5) we\nobtain Eq. (6) of the main text. Notice this is in agreement with Ref. [72] considering that we expand the stray field contribution to second order in R near the equilibrium radius. To include the temperature gradient, we considered the temperature dependence of the parameters,\n( ) ( )S S lim\n0 1 T\nM T M T     = \u2212      , ( ) ( ) ( )0A T A m T = , ( ) ( ) ( )0D T D m T = , ( ) ( ) ( )0u uK T K m T = ,\nand considered that the temperature ( )0TT x x= \u2212 is a linear function of the position along x .\nFurthermore, we considered that for a small gradient T , the radius of the skyrmion is given by the parameters at the center of the skyrmion. Within this formalism, we obtained the energy E . Specifically, we plot the energy difference with respect to the energy minimum Emin for each case minE E E = \u2212 (see Fig. S1). Correctly, the energy decreases for higher temperature (motion from the cold to the hot region) in the first case, and decreases for lower temperature (motion from the hot to the cold region) for the second case. As the curve slopes are opposite in the two cases, the two forces are also opposite. Mind that the energy calculated from the micromagnetic simulations refers to the entire sample which also includes boundary effects, while the one from the Thiele\u2019s equation refers only to the skyrmion. This is a possible reason of the quantitative difference between the two approaches. The skyrmion radius in both micromagnetic simulations and Thiele\u2019s equation is approximately constant for the material parameters and temperature gradient chosen. For instance, for the singlelayer FM with the scaling relations of the single layer, the micromagnetic radius is 34.6 nm + 0.2 nm, whereas, in the analytical formalism is 28.33 nm + 0.01 nm. The viscosity tensor is rather constant as well, with a value of 18.13 nm-2 + 0.07 nm-2. The parameters a and b were calculated based on the obtained stray field in the micromagnetic simulations as well as fitting the radius of the skyrmion with the micromagnetic simulations.\nFig. S1: energy vs. temperature and skyrmion position as calculated from (a) and (b) micromagnetic simulations, respectively, and (c) and (d) from the Thiele\u2019s equation. (a) and (c) concern a single layer FM with the scaling relations of the single layer, whereas (b) and (d) are related to a single layer FM with the scaling relations of the multilayer.\nSupplemental Note 3 \u2013 Effect of the entropic torque due to a single parameter gradient\nTo understand the contribution that each micromagnetic parameter gradient has on the skyrmion motion and trajectory (x-y position of the skyrmion core, calculated as the geometrical center of the\ncircular region enclosed within 0zm  ), we initially analyze the effect of a linear gradient along the x-axis of only one micromagnetic parameter at a time. Figure S2 shows the skyrmion trajectories characterized by a finite skyrmion Hall angle in a single-layer FM, but similar results are obtained in a multilayer. We observe two antagonistic effects which lead to two qualitatively-opposite skyrmion Hall angles. In particular, with regard to the x-component of the motion, our results can be summarized as follows: the perpendicular anisotropy and exchange gradients (Fig. S2(a) and (b)) promote the skyrmion motion to the region where that parameter is smaller, therefore from the cold to the hot region. On the contrary, the MS (magnetostatic field), D and the combination of MS and A gradients (Fig. S2(c)(e)) shift the skyrmion towards the region where those parameters are larger, thus from the hot to the cold region. This behavior can be deduced from the skyrmion energy which increases as a function of the anisotropy and exchange parameter but decreases as a function of the DMI.\nFig. S2: 2D view of the single layer FM as obtained from micromagnetic simulations illustrating the skyrmion trajectory under linear gradient of: (a) A (b) Ku (c) MS (d) D (e) MS and A acting simultaneously.\nSupplemental Note 4 \u2013 Effect of the gradient amplitude\nWe also performed a systematic study on the effect of the magnitude of the thermal gradient on the skyrmion velocity. Figure S3(a) shows that the velocity increases linearly with the gradient in a single-layer FM. The small deviation from linearity is ascribed to the scaling exponents of the parameters. Indeed, we in the multilayer systems (Fig. S3(b)), with different scaling relations, we achieve a linear behavior.\nFig. S3: Skyrmion velocity as a function of the magnitude of the thermal gradient in (a) single-layer FM, and (b) multilayer. The blue triangles (red dots) correspond to the x-component (y-component) of the velocity. Solid lines are linear fits of the data.\nSupplemental Note 5 \u2013 Effect of the magnonic torque\nThe magnonic torque is simulated by including into the LLG equation (Eq.

We simulated the effect of a stochastic linear thermal field gradient from 0 to 100 K by performing different realizations, as shown in Fig. S4. The skyrmion moves towards the hot region (in agreement with previous results [45]) with a dispersion of the Hall angle due to the finite thermal fluctuations.\nFig. S4: Skyrmion trajectories in a single-layer FM due to different realizations of the stochastic thermal field."
