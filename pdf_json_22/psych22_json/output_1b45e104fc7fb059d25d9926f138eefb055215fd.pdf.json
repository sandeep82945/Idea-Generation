    "abstractText": "Debates about the most appropriate language to use when referring to autism are ongoing (Lei et al., 2021). For many years, \u201cperson-first\u201d language was recommended, especially in professional settings. It was viewed as respectful to separate a disability from the one who \u201chad\u201d it: \u201cperson with autism.\u201d Advocates disputed this view, describing autism as an essential part of themselves and not something negative from which they wished to be separated. They embraced \u201cidentity-first\u201d language: \u201cautistic person\u201d (Kenny et al., 2016). When interacting with an individual, it is possible to use the terms they prefer, but that is not the case when writing about autism in the abstract. Authors must decide what language they will use. For the purposes of this paper, we are making a conscious choice to use \u201cidentity -first\u201d language. We will also use the phrase \u201con the autism spectrum\u201d \u2013 a descriptor that has been found to be acceptable among many autistic adults (Bury et al., 2020). Likewise, we will minimally use medicalized terms that are unavoidable Introduction",

For many years, \u201cperson-first\u201d language was recommended, especially in professional settings. It was viewed as respectful to separate a disability from the one who \u201chad\u201d it: \u201cperson with autism.\u201d Advocates disputed this view, describing autism as an essential part of themselves and not something negative from which they wished to be separated. They embraced \u201cidentity-first\u201d language: \u201cautistic person\u201d (Kenny et al., 2016). When interacting with an individual, it is possible to use the terms they prefer, but that is not the case when writing about autism in the abstract. Authors must decide what language they will use.

We will also use the phrase \u201con the autism spectrum\u201d \u2013 a descriptor that has been found to be acceptable among many autistic adults (Bury et al., 2020).

Pediatric longitudinal research can answer key questions regarding course of symptom presentation, supports needed over time, and family impact as well as best practices in terms of treatment. It can also involve unique challenges. One of these is the issue of consent that arises when researchers intend to follow young participants into adulthood. First, they must determine if a young person is going to be placed under guardianship at the age of majority. If so, parental consent will endure. If instead the young person will become a legal adult, they must be re-consented as such.

            "text": "Researchers conducting longitudinal studies hope to keep their participants engaged over time, whether that is a year or a decade. A great deal of effort and expense go into recruitment and retention; maintaining a sample of sufficient size and diversity is important to validity of results and generalizability of findings. To recruit and keep study participants engaged, researchers craft careful communications, offer alternate modes of data collection (in-home vs. in-clinic interviews), and provide incentives like gift cards (Booker et al., 2011). They may brand their study with a recognizable logo (Taylor et al., 2015), and create community through a website or e-newsletter\u2014what Teague et al. (2018) call \u201ccommunity building\u201d (p. 10).\nAdditional effort is needed to recruit and retain participants who face exceptional daily struggles. For example, to maintain the participation of homeless people, researchers collect contact information of people with whom the homeless socialize, make community visits, and check in frequently (Hobden et al., 2011; Gerlitz et al., 2017). To accommodate people living in poverty\u2014who may balance multiple jobs, struggle with childcare, and have little reliable transportation\u2014researchers offer multiple data collection choices (online, in person, or by mail), allow for varied communication preferences (e.g., phone, text), provide a dedicated phone line for study assistance, and emphasize participant convenience (Nelson et al., 2021; Nicholson et al., 2011). Ethnic and racial minorities may feel mistrust towards research itself due to a long history of mistreatment by academic and clinical institutions. Researchers have learned to base recruitment in community settings with staff that are \u201cculturally matched\u201d to participants and an approach that builds on altruistic motives based in family and community (George et al., 2014, p. e25). In each case, researchers seek ways to reduce barriers and make participation easier.\nPediatric longitudinal studies and research registries face an additional dilemma. Participating children, whose consent was initially provided by parents, will reach legal adulthood at some point\u2014a juncture we call \u201caging-up.\u201d Unless an Institutional Review Board (IRB) waives the requirement for informed consent, researchers will need to re-consent these now young adult participants (Office of Human Research Protections, 2022).\nIn some cases, re-consent may not be required. A waiver may be granted even for ongoing analysis of data earlier collected from identifiable research subjects under certain circumstances, including those outlined in 45 CFR 46.116(f) (Code of Federal Regulations, 2022). These include a determination that the study involves minimal risk, could not be carried out without the requested waiver, and will not adversely impact the subjects. For example, the Pediatric Proton Consortium Registry, which follows children treated with proton radiotherapy via medical record review, was granted a waiver as long as at least three attempts were made to reach aging-up participants. Previously, more than 70% had failed to respond to attempts to reach and re-consent them. The waiver therefore made it possible to gain vital knowledge about young adult outcomes that would have otherwise been unattainable (Kassis et al., 2017). In the case of biobanks, Brothers & Wilfond (2017) argue that such waivers should be granted frequently. They assert that re-consenting young adults is \u201cpreferable but not obligatory\u201d (p. 1) considering the balance that must be maintained between principles of informed consent and the fact that research using existing biological samples may enhance the public good.\nOf course, pediatric studies that plan to keep their agingup participants actively engaged in ongoing research have an obligation to re-consent them (Resnick, 2014). Unfortunately, there is a dearth of research on the longitudinal follow-up of pediatric research participants into adulthood. With the exception of highly specific studies like this one, few large, longitudinal research studies have grappled with reengaging a large child population as adults."

            "text": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which currently effects 1 in 44 U.S. children (Maenner et al., 2021), is characterized by difficulty understanding and responding to the social world in a natural, intuitive fashion as well as restrictive, repetitive behaviors, activities, and interests (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). The term \u201cspectrum\u201d conveys the fact that people with this diagnosis vary greatly in intellectual capacity, language ability, social motivation, adaptive functioning, and many other traits. Indeed, it is due to this heterogeneity that extremely large samples are needed for autism research.\nTo meet this need, SPARK, supported by the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI), has recruited over 100,000 children on the autism spectrum and their family members, as well as autistic adults, to participate in clinical, genetic, and survey research. While some SPARK participants are recruited from clinical sites around\n1 3\n19\nJournal of Autism and Developmental Disorders (2024) 54:18\u201332\nthe United States and share medical records, the vast majority take part solely through online questionnaires. The data provided are of high quality. A recent study drew upon electronic medical records to confirm that caregiver- and selfreported ASD diagnoses in SPARK were accurate in 98% of cases (Fombonne et al., 2021).\nPer the SPARK Consortium (2018), the project not only conducts its own research but enables the research of others through the Research Match program. External research projects are screened for quality and appropriateness and, if approved, receive assistance recruiting from among the thousands of SPARK participants who meet study criteria. Care is taken not to overwhelm any single participant with too many requests. The project\u2019s overall aim is to accelerate autism research across the board.\nRecruitment and retention are paramount. SPARK strives to maximize both by creating a sense of partnership with participants and making participation as convenient as possible. Through its website, newsletters, and webinars SPARK stays in touch, providing needed resources, sharing study results in family-friendly language, and otherwise striving to maintain a sense of community (The SPARK Consortium, 2018). Like other pediatric longitudinal studies, SPARK strives to be sensitive to the needs of participants who are caring for or have been affected by a condition that makes life challenging. Participants may be parents of young children navigating the special education system and advocating for treatments (Neely et al., 2012), or parents of teens worried about their child\u2019s future services or employment (First et al., 2016). They may be adults on the spectrum with their own concerns, such as access to adequate vocational or mental health services (Schott et al., 2021).\nSPARK faces many challenges in common with other pediatric longitudinal efforts, including one of particular urgency: how to engage and re-consent newly independent young adults so that they are not lost to this ongoing study. This is especially essential when it comes to autism. In 2018, only 3% of U.S. federal and private autism research funding was allocated to adult-focused projects (IACC, 2021). Lack of data makes it nearly impossible to accurately characterize autistic adults let alone inform data-driven policy (Robison, 2019). Therefore, the aim of the current effort is to provide recommendations to SPARK about how to best approach the re-consenting process. These recommendations involve identification of motivations in support of continued participation; types and timing of contact as adulthood approaches; and key parental concerns, sensitivities, and hopes that may influence the tone and wording of communications about a teen\u2019s aging-up."

This is an inductive method wherein researchers\u2019 understanding of a phenomenon are permitted to evolve as data are collected, new insights emerge, and ever more pertinent questions are asked (Corbin & Strauss, 2014). In this case, what we sought was a more complete understanding of the circumstances and issues surrounding the transition to adulthood in general and re-consenting in particular.\nTo recruit families, our Towson University (TU) team coordinated with SPARK\u2019s Research Match program. To begin, two TU Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals were submitted to SPARK: one for the parent-focused study (Parent and Youth Transition Hopes and Fears: Implications for Continued Engagement in SPARK, Part 1 - Parents) and one for the teenager-focused study (Part 2\u2014Teens). In addition, a Researcher Distribution Agreement was executed so that TU could access limited SPARK data (e.g., teen gender, race) for any participant consented into the TU study.\nRecruitment emails describing the TU effort and containing a link to \u201cclick here if interested in this study\u201d were then sent to qualified families through the Research Match platform. Those who clicked were taken to an authorization screen. Once they provided authorization, SPARK could share their emails, phone numbers, and other limited data with the TU team. At that point, the TU researchers became the main point of contact, sending out detailed recruitment emails and scheduling interviews. Via an online form, parents provided consent for themselves and, when a teen agreed to their own interview, their teen. Participating teens completed an online assent form.\nAt intervals, the SPARK and TU teams gauged the diversity of the sample in terms of race, ethnicity, region, family income, and other factors. Representation by race and ethnicity was initially inadequate. The team then oversampled African-American and Hispanic families to address the representativeness of the study participants."

These were to some extent informed by our earlier work with a similar population: young adults on the autism spectrum and their parents (Anderson & Butt, 2018).\nWe began with interview transcripts, then employed Atlas.ti qualitative analysis software to code portions of each narrative. Two coders independently marked each interview, meeting afterwards to merge their codes and discuss until agreeing on a final code. To enhance the study\u2019s rigor, we \u201canalyzed negative cases,\u201d questioning emerging concepts when subsequent interviews failed to support them (Lincoln & Guba, 1985, p. 309). (For example, based on early interviews we expected parents\u2019 guardianship plans to be unambiguous, falling into clear \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d groups. We had to modify this conceptualization when subsequent interviewees described ambivalence regarding guardianship decisions.) For the current effort, we segregated material related most strongly to issues surrounding re-consenting including stressors at transition and attitudes about research participation.\nResults\u2014Part 1: Emergent Groups \u201cOn the Spectrum\u201d\nTo better grasp the experiences and views of these families and teens, we first divided them into meaningful groups based on a teenager\u2019s place on the autism spectrum. Considering the many potential combinations of gifts and challenges embodied by any one autistic person, this was a complex task. We applied both deductive and inductive approaches. We had grappled with a similar question in an earlier study involving autistic young adults (Anderson & Butt, 2018) and kept these groupings in mind as we considered the new sample (deductive approach). However, we also applied the constant comparative method to look at the new sample through multiple lenses, with old categories\nThese included items like \u201cHow old was your teenager when they received a first ASD diagnosis?\u201d and \u201cWhat type of high school does your teenager currently attend?\u201d Next came a semi-structured interview. The interviewer followed the participant\u2019s lead while covering a variety of topics, including a teen\u2019s history, autism diagnosis, school experiences, and social life with particular emphasis on the approaching transition to adulthood. The current study is directed specifically at the interview\u2019s final section with its focus on ongoing participation in autism research.\nDuring parent interviews, it was possible to glean if the teen under discussion might be able to participate in their own separate interview. (Because these were phone or WebEx interviews, teens needed to be verbal and intellectually capable of answering some basic questions on their own.) If a teen appeared to be a possible interview candidate, parents were asked if they thought their teen might be interested. Some declined to reach out to their teen citing their likely disinterest or anxiety, while others agreed to discuss the possibility with their teen.\nIn all 22 teenagers were asked to participate, with 13 (59%) completing an interview: ten males, one female, and two identifying as nonbinary and preferring the pronouns \u201cthey/them.\u201d Eight teens chose to be interviewed by phone and five via WebEx. In addition to experiences with and interest in autism research, interviews focused on family, school, friends, and the future. This last topic was probed only if a teen\u2019s anxiety allowed as it has been reported that some teens on the autism spectrum find it difficult to contemplate the major changes the end of high school represents (Anderson et al., 2021; Cheak-Zamora et al., 2015). We stopped talking about the future if a teen changed the subject or outright told us it was something they preferred not to discuss. For example, one 15-year-old declared:"

Drawing from the experience of Harrington et al. (2014), interviewers sought to match their manner to a teen\u2019s needs, using simpler language when indicated, being concrete, and giving extra time to process if required. Some uttered only a few words in response to questions while others spoke at length. When a teen spoke very little, interviewers could not ascertain whether this was due to limited understanding, boredom, anxiety due to the unfamiliarity of the encounter, or autism-associated symptoms like difficulty with social reciprocity or social engagement.\n1 3\n21\nJournal of Autism and Developmental Disorders (2024) 54:18\u201332\nexisting as possibilities but not determinative. Through this inductive approach we winnowed from the teens\u2019 characteristics two key categorization criteria: intellectual ability, which had also been a group criterion for our earlier sample, and psychiatric or behavioral issues.\nCognitive ability was conceptualized as a choice between \u201cintellectually disabled (ID)\u201d and \u201cnot intellectually disabled (NID).\u201d We drew from three sources to determine whether a teen was designated ID or NID. First, there was the parent\u2019s initial assessment of their teen\u2019s cognitive ability at the time they signed up for SPARK. At that time, they were asked to mark down whether their child had Cognitive Impairment\u2014true or false. Second, at the time of our interview we asked parents if their teen had co-occurring intellectual disability and noted their answer: ID\u2014yes or no. If these answers contradicted, as they did in six cases, a review of the interview transcript was conducted by our team. ID or NID status was then assigned based on the parent\u2019s description of their teen\u2019s daily functioning, type of schools attended, high school document at completion (certificate vs. diploma) and expected age at graduation\u2014typically 21 for those with ID and 18 for those without. In addition, there was one case where the parent told both SPARK and our interviewer that their teen was NID but the team designated the teen ID for purposes of group membership. This was based on several factors that taken all together seemed to indicate ID status: attending an ABA Therapy School into the teenage years, an expected age at high school graduation of 22, and being completely nonverbal.\nCo-occurring psychiatric and/or behavioral issues were gleaned from parent accounts via questionnaires, which asked whether a teen had co-occurring anxiety, depression, or other psychiatric diagnoses, and interviews during which parents brought up challenges salient to them. These ranged from a teen\u2019s tendency to shut down and cry under stress to a teen\u2019s violent outbursts, suspension from school, suicidal ideation, or hospitalization. Based on the overall picture for any one individual, our team debated until consensus was reached on whether to categorize a teen\u2019s psychiatric or behavioral issues as internalizing (with anxiety as a key feature; INT); externalizing (with aggression, outbursts, or self-injury; EXT); or \u201cjust autistic\u201d with no particular psychiatric or behavioral problems reported. Externalizing behavior trumped internalizing behavior such that a person with both was placed in an externalizing category. The six groups that resulted from this exercise appear in Table 2 and are repeated here for the reader\u2019s convenience: 4 (9%) ID only; 4 (9%) ID-INT; 2 (4%) ID-EXT; 7 (15%) NID only; 17 (37%) NID-INT; and 12 (26%) NID-EXT.

Most parents (96%) could easily describe their reasons for involvement in both past and future autism research. The most frequently mentioned motivation was a need for answers. 57% hoped to understand autism better, and to have a clearer path forward. Some focused on their earliest experiences of autism and how a quest for answers still drives them. The mother of 16-year-old Charlie [NIDEXT] remarked:\nI\u2019m sorry I get so choked up on this. That feeling of right after getting the diagnosis and going to all the things and still not having an answer\u2026 it was a long, long road to get through it and just not having answers. I am somebody who just needs logic to understand.\nOthers sought answers about more current matters. Speaking of extreme behaviors emerging at puberty, Kevin\u2019s [NID-EXT] mother said:\nI\u2019m motivated by the fact that there needs to be more studies, there needs to be more research, there needs to be more generalities; research has got to start coming up with something other than research for the sake of research. That motivates me, so that other people don\u2019t have to go through what I went through last year when we never saw it coming. I thought he was possessed. I really thought I needed to bring a priest in.\nAs is captured in the phrase \u201cso that other people don\u2019t have to go through what I went through,\u201d altruism was another driving factor, and one that was often mentioned alongside the need for answers. A desire to help other people on the spectrum and their families was in fact mentioned by 52% of parents. For example, Theo\u2019s [NID-EXT] mother shared:\ncategories was 11 (24%) with none, 21 (46%) with internalizing issues, and 14 (30%) with externalizing issues.\nPlease note: to enhance readability and provide context, group type will follow teen pseudonyms throughout (e.g., \u201cSuzie\u2019s [NID-EXT] mother said\u2026\u201d).\nIt is our hope that this conceptualization of the autism spectrum will help us better understand the diverse experiences of our participants while avoiding the oversimplification of that spectrum into a \u201clow- vs. high-functioning\u201d binary. It is clear from the composition of these groups that there are some autistic ID individuals who have few \u201cbehavioral challenges\u201d and might function better in the world than, for example, an autistic NID individual with frequent aggressive outbursts.\nOne theme linked to the low- vs. high-functioning binary came from just two families but was nevertheless significant. They expressed a belief that those who were \u201clower\u201d are not of interest to researchers. Benjamin\u2019s [ID] mother said:\nIt\u2019s not just teenagers that they haven\u2019t really studied, but the lower functioning kids with autism sort of get ignored if you ask me\u2026 Especially when they get older. When they\u2019re little, it\u2019s more like, \u201cOh, let\u2019s focus on it so we can fix them.\u201d But then when they\u2019re older, they\u2019re like, \u201cOh, they\u2019re not fixable.\u201d They just kind of let them go... If I was going to say something about research that\u2019s just what I would say. It\u2019s like a black hole, nobody really goes there.\nResults\u2014Part 2: Views on Research and Reconsenting\nParents and autistic teens were able to steer the conversation to topics of importance to them through most of the interview.

For about-to-be-legal-adults, how should they reach out to encourage completion of a new online consent?

Whether email, texting, phone, or social media was a preferred method of communication for a teen was specific to the individual with no overall theme emerging.\nA theme that did surface was that of mothers as facilitators of continued \u201cindependent adult\u201d participation in SPARK. Perhaps unsurprisingly, teens were described as focused on their own concerns and unlikely to wade through a lengthy email or mail packet without some action by their parent. Therefore, some parents asked for materials to help them explain re-consenting to their teen\u2014most often a video (perhaps on YouTube) or handout. Preferences differed. \u201cIf it\u2019s a video, he\u2019ll watch it in a hot second,\u201d said one parent.

One way to do that was to send the teen-intended packet via mail. Charlie\u2019s [NID-EXT] mother stated:\nParents also shared their views about the best terms to use when reaching out about re-consenting.

This may reflect the executive-functioning challenges described in programs aimed at addressing autistic characteristics when planning schoolbased interventions (Aspy & Grossman, 2011). Some mothers explained that they and their teens had developed a system where the mother monitored deadlines and major events to help keep their teen on track with reminders or a little bit of assistance. The more the re-consenting process would permit that system to work, the more it would succeed.

Parental sensitivity to guardianship topic difficult to predict No matter a teen\u2019s cognitive or behavioral profile, families may find the decision surrounding guardianship emotionally difficult. Communications should be crafted to sensitively broach the topic in case a parent finds this topic challenging. Families are not always aware of alternatives to guardianship or how legal status impacts continuing participation in a research project Materials should explain alternatives to guardianship from powers-of-attorney to Supported Decision Making (SDM) models; many families are eager for more information about these matters and also need assistance understanding how they relate to their teen\u2019s ability to continue participating in a research project they joined as a child with their parent\u2019s consent.\n1 3\nJournal of Autism and Developmental Disorders (2024) 54:18\u201332\nto full guardianship (Martinis et al., 2021). Unfortunately, schools\u2019 habitual transition practices tend to bias parents in the direction of full guardianship resulting in what the National Council on Disability (2019) calls the \u201cschool-toguardianship pipeline\u201d (p. 29). This may explain why more than half of adults with autism using developmental disability services are under full guardianship (Roux et al., 2021). Indeed, Raley et al., (2020) have called for an amendment to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) so that parents are provided information about less drastic alternatives including narrowly focused powers of attorney (e.g., medical, financial) and SDM models that preserve a young adult\u2019s right to self-determination. Such alternatives should be of particular interest to families of teens with autism or any other condition with a wide spectrum of functioning. It is interesting to note that even when prompted, only three parents participating in the current study mentioned the possibility of a power of attorney for their teen and only one mentioned the concept of a \u201climited guardianship.\u201d None used the term \u201csupported decision-making.\u201d Understanding alternatives to guardianship is not only an area where families apparently need support, but one researchers and IRBs will also need to understand better as they are growing in popularity and have implications for consent."

            "text": "Motivations for taking part in research were somewhat different for parents and teens. Parents\u2019 top reasons for participating in SPARK were a quest for answers and altruism followed by an interest in family genetics, an expectation of helpful resources, and hope for help that would lead to their teen\u2019s adult support or success. Only one mentioned her interest in receiving a gift card or other incentive. Of 27 parents who commented on their teen\u2019s motivations for research participation, about half mentioned their interest in incentives while 41% mentioned altruism. Although only seven teens discussed motivation regarding research participation, these were also their most frequently mentioned motivations.\nBased on these findings, to recruit or retain parents of autistic teens it may be most helpful to emphasize the answers\u2014including genetic ones\u2014researchers hope to generate; the greater good they hope to serve; and the useful information that will be provided along the way. This last is particularly significant as these teens approach the transition to adulthood. Resources about special education and childhood concerns are plentiful. Those about adult paths, services, and outcomes are not. SPARK already provides family-friendly articles, e-newsletters, and webinars to their participants \u2013innovative approaches that have been associated with improved retention rates (Teague et al., 2018).\npermitting them to investigate challenges, design communications, and offer resources matched to a group\u2019s specific profile.\nOne topic broached by two mothers of ID teens was that \u201clow-functioning\u201d individuals are not of interest to researchers. It may be that this is something families with ID and/or nonverbal children have internalized over time. McKinney et al., (2021) note that families of autistic children with \u201cprofound communication difficulties\u201d have often been excluded from research and \u201cmay become increasingly hopeless and isolated\u201d (p. 1636). Autism researchers should be concrete and direct about their desire to include such families. Mentions of the \u201cautism spectrum\u201d like what appeared in our research invitation may not be enough to reassure these families that they are wanted and welcome.\nA critical step in the re-consenting process is determining intended guardianship status. Will a teen become a legal adult at the age of majority and need to be re-consented or not? Speaking with families, we found this was not as straightforward as might be expected. First, although parents of ID teens are more likely than those of NID teens to have definite guardianship plans (70% vs. 22%), there were exceptions. Three (30%) of the parents of ID teens were ambivalent, with two of these describing the guardianship decision as an emotional struggle. Likewise, a teen\u2019s behavioral profile did not always correspond with guardianship intentions. For example, guardianship was definite for only half of teens with externalizing behaviors, including aggression. Most important to note, the twenty (43%) parents expressing ambivalence found the guardianship question distressing no matter their teen\u2019s IQ or behaviors. As there is no easy way to predict an individual parent\u2019s feelings related to guardianship, communication around guardianship decisions requires special sensitivity.\nIt also requires awareness of current debates regarding guardianship, something that seemed unfamiliar to nearly all parent participants. There has been a philosophical shift towards less restrictive arrangements for adults who may need assistance making decisions (Blanck, 2021), including increasing interest in a supported decision-making (SDM) model wherein people with limitations seek out help making decisions from family and friends just as typical people do, whether with a formalized arrangement in place or not (Kohn, 2021). This reflects \u201ca change of paradigm in the conception of disability from a medical capacity/incapacity model to a social model based on supports and founded on human rights\u201d as set forth in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (G\u00f3mez Penalver et al., 2021, p. 230). Courts have begun to incorporate these principles, with 22% of 51 U.S. jurisdictions establishing laws that recognize SDM and a majority at least requiring consideration of less restrictive alternatives\n1 3\n28\nJournal of Autism and Developmental Disorders (2024) 54:18\u201332\nschool years to more fine-tuned instructions about re-consenting as age 18 approached. Along with information for parents, some suggested, it would be wise to provide materials they could use to explain the consent process to their teen. Engaging, easy-to-understand hand-outs or videos (perhaps via YouTube links) were suggested.\nAlso critical was parents\u2019 view of the role they would likely play in any re-consenting process. Mothers sometimes explained that they had developed methods of helping keep their teen on track with regards to homework and other activities and could play this same role vis a vis re-consenting. To do so they needed to know when the re-consenting moment was coming. If an email or text was sent to their teen and missed or ignored, they would be unable to offer assistance or reminders. A large packet coming by mail they would see; otherwise, they needed some kind of notification that the teen was about to be contacted.\nThis raises another matter\u2014that of ongoing parental involvement, at least insofar as knowing a communication is coming and being ready to remind a now young adult that the parent is happy to assist with any action needed. For instance, the re-consent completed by new adults might be crafted to include permission for parents to be copied on important study emails or invitations as long as the adult is given the opportunity to \u201copt out\u201d of such an arrangement. Perhaps there would also need to be some parental guidelines that encourage reminders or helpful explanations but discourage exertion of undue pressure to participate. Indeed, earlier communications might touch on alternatives to guardianship and themes of self-determination that prepare parents to consider their role in this light.\nThose taking part in the current study urged researchers to use plain language and make it easy for overwhelmed parents to absorb and respond to information. Parents also recommended using email subject lines and other communications with the term \u201ctransition to adulthood.\u201d This was viewed as positive in a way that \u201clegal status\u201d or \u201cguardianship\u201d was not. (Recall that the term \u201cguardianship\u201d elicited dismissal from some and discomfort from others.) Regarding the form contact with teens should take there was no agreement. Mail, phone calls, texts, email, and social media were all mentioned, both positively and negatively. The conclusion that can be drawn is that, in order to reach every teen, multiple modes of communication would be best."

When exploring these issues, we found it most effective to enter a collaborative mode with these families, taking the time to explain these complex concepts and then inviting parental input. On the whole, parents recommended beginning contact about guardianship and re-consenting as the teen became 15\u201316 years old. This would allow for multiple contacts\u2014perhaps one or two a year\u2014until the 17th birthday when contacts could become more frequent.\nParents suggested that any reminders be paired with critically needed information. Resources were viewed as of high value and something that would continue to engage them. Specifically, parents were looking for forewarning of key decision points in the transition process. What should they be thinking about in terms of their teen\u2019s eventual legal status, high school program (should they exit at 18 or 21?), postsecondary education, employment, or adult services? General information would be welcome, as would links to more specific information by state.

In Maryland, for example, the Division of Rehabilitation Services (DORS) is the VR agency which not only retrains people who become disabled so they can return to employment but provides a community college support program for degree-seeking autistic students (DORS, n.d. a) as well as a driver\u2019s training program for autistic individuals (DORS, n.d. b).\nIt was proposed that the nature of content morph over time, from general transition information in the early high\n1 3\n29\nJournal of Autism and Developmental Disorders (2024) 54:18\u201332\nEthics Approval All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.

            "text": "Pediatric longitudinal studies seeking to re-consent teen participants as they become legal adults may encounter unforeseen obstacles. When a sample includes teens who may not have full rights as adults, these include family sensitivities around guardianship decisions critical to young participants\u2019 status at the age of majority. Such decisions have a direct effect on researchers who must be able to divide participants approaching adulthood into those who do and do not need to be re-consented. Families whose teen will become an independent adult may need support understanding re-consenting as well as materials that will help them explain the ongoing study and consent process to their teen. Additional research is needed to further explore these dynamics across different types of studies with different populations of interest. Also critical for longitudinal research is an investigation of the growing impact of alternatives to guardianship and the implications of these for young adults\u2019 legal status and capacity to re-consent.\nAuthor Contributions CA conceptualized the study, conducted interviews, performed coding and qualitative data analysis, and drafted the final manuscript. AI and LF conducted interviews and performed coding and qualitative data analysis; AD, KD, and JKL contributed to interpretation of the data and critically reviewed the manuscript. All authors read and approved the final manuscript.\nFunding This study was funded by the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI) through their contractor, Kennedy Krieger Institute (#5060076), and by Towson University.\nDeclarations\n1 3\n30\nJournal of Autism and Developmental Disorders (2024) 54:18\u201332\nKenny, L., Hattersley, C., Molins, B., Buckley, C., Povey, C., & Pellicano, E.
