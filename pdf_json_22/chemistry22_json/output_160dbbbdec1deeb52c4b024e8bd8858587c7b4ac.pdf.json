Many folklore uses of Terminalia neotaliala (Madagascar\u2019s almond) included treating arterial hypertension, diabetes, diarrhea, dysentery, colic, oral and digestive candidiasis, intestinal parasitic infections, inflammatory skin conditions, postpartum care, and mycotic infections but nevertheless scientifically explored for its medicinal and pharmacological importance. Therefore, the current study intended to prepare methanolic extract and its fractionation with hexane, chloroform, and butanol followed by evaluation of their polyphenolic content, biological activities, and LCMS analysis. The biological study included antioxidant activity and enzyme inhibition assay i.e., \u03b1-glucosidase and urease. The insight study of biologically active secondary metabolites of butanol fraction (BUAE) was performed through LCMS.",

The biological study included antioxidant activity and enzyme inhibition assay i.e., \u03b1-glucosidase and urease. The insight study of biologically active secondary metabolites of butanol\nfraction (BUAE) was performed through LCMS.\nMethods\nThe total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC) of hydroalcoholic and its\nfractions were estimated using the Folin-Ciocalteu and aluminum chloride method. The total\ntannin content (TTC) was determined using the Folin-Denis spectrophotometric method.\nSimilarly, the antioxidant potential of HAAE, HEAE, CFAE, and BUAE was determined\nusing four methods as DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl), 2,2-azinobis(3-ethylbenothia-\nzoline)-6-sulfonic acid, cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC), and ferric reducing\nantioxidant power (FRAP). The sample extracts were also evaluated against two clinically important enzymes i.e., \u03b1-glucosidase and urease.\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0266094 March 31, 2022 1 / 22\nOPEN ACCESS\nCitation: Shahzad MN, Ahmad S, Tousif MI, Ahmad I, Rao H, Ahmad B, et al.

            "text": "In consonance with a WHO report, approximately 80 percent of the world\u2019s population relies on medicinal plants and herbal drugs [1]. The phytochemicals worked as defense soldiers to maintain human and animal health by regulating metabolic systems [2]. The ROS (reactive oxygen species) produced during metabolic processes negatively affected cellular components and disturbed their metabolic functions [3, 4]. The antioxidant prevented the accumulation of highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) and protected the cells against oxidative damage [5].\nThe production of scavengers, endogenous enzymes, and hormones [6] produced during\nthe inflammatory disorders was found incapable to fight against excessive accumulation of highly ROS. The plants were reported rich sources of natural antioxidants which augmented the production of these endogenous molecules and protected the body from the negative effects of ROS [7].\nOver the last three decades, more than 4000 antioxidants had been isolated from medicinal\nplants which include polyphenols such as flavonoids, proanthocyanidins, phenolic acids, tocopherols, tannins, coumarins, and anthraquinones [8, 9]. These phenolic compounds showed antioxidant activity owing to oxidation-reduction potential and metal-chelating effect [10].\nTerminalia is the second-largest genus including 200 species [11]. The word \u201cTerminalia\u201d originated from the Latin word terminus (end or extremity of a thing, boundary, or limit) because the leaves grow at the tips of their shoots [12]. The Terminalia neotaliala (T. mantaly H. Perrier, T. obscordiformis) belongs to the family \u201cCombretaceae\u201d and is vernacularly known as Madagascar\u2019s almond or the umbrella tree. It is a large endemic tree that grows to 20 m height in dry, humid, and subhumid forests at elevations of 0\u2013500 m [10].\nAn extensive literature survey revealed its ethnobotanical use for treating arterial hypertension, gastroenteritis, diarrhea, dysentery, diabetes, colic, oral and digestive candidiasis, intestinal parasitic infections, inflammatory skin conditions, postpartum care, and mycotic infection. According to another study, leaf, and bark extracts of T. neotaliala were also used against hypertension, gastroenteritis, diabetes, skin conditions, oral and genital candidiasis [13].\nThe Terminalia species have been screened for their antioxidant potential by DPPH, superoxide radical scavenging, and FRAP assays and showed high antioxidant potential [11]. But\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0266094 March 31, 2022 2 / 22\nCompeting interests: The authors declare that no competing interests are involved in this study.\nthe phytochemical and biological activity of T. neotaliala has not been detailed evaluated. In the present study, we prepared hydroalcoholic extract and its different solvent fractions followed by evaluation of their polyphenolic content, pharmacological activities such as antioxidant and enzyme inhibition. Qualitative metabolomic profiling of the butanol fraction of T. neotaliala was also performed using LCMS."

The TTC determination revealed that the highest level of tannins was present in the butanol fraction of the aerial parts of T. neotaliala (143.32 \u00b1 4.32 mg. TA.Eq.g-1 DE). The literature survey confirmed the presence of hydrolyzable and condensed tannins in genus Terminalia those who were reported with a high amount of TPC and TFC. The statistical analysis of TPC, TFC, TTC, and\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0266094.g005\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0266094.g006\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0266094 March 31, 2022 11 / 22\nantioxidant activity revealed that each sample extract solution i.e., HAAE, HEAE, CFAE, and BUAE; was significantly different from the other sample extract solution (p< 0.05). The tannins can function as chain-terminating antioxidants, metal chelators, reducing agents, scavengers of reactive oxygen species, and quenchers of singlet oxygen. The chloroform showed poor affinity to extract hydrolyzable tannins during extraction; therefore, CFAE exhibited the lowest polyphenolic content 6.86 \u00b1 0.22 mg.GAE.g-1 DE. The tannins, especially hydrolyzable tannins (HTs), constitute a major class of plant secondary metabolites, including simple gallic acid derivatives, gallotannins, and ellagitannins [37]. Tannins, especially hydrolyzable tannins, have attracted attention in recent decades because of their antioxidant potential and biological\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0266094.g007\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0266094.g008\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0266094 March 31, 2022 12 / 22\nactivity [38]. Many ellagitannins and hydrolyzable tannins, including ellagic acid, gallic acid, methyl gallate, ethyl gallate, chebulinic acid, corilagin, penta galloyl glucose, tetra galloyl betaD-glucose, and casuarinin from the dichloromethane fraction of T. chebula fruit, improved type II collagen-induced arthritis in BALB/c mice [39]. These tannins were involved in the wound healing process by increasing the rate of epithelization [40].\nType II diabetes is one of the most prevalent metabolic disorders both in low and high-\nincome countries being managed by improving insulin secretion and controlling blood glucose levels by administering oral hypoglycemic drugs such as \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors, sulfonylureas, and biguanides. The inhibition of \u03b1-glucosidase found in the epithelium of the small\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0266094.g009\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0266094.g010\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0266094 March 31, 2022 13 / 22\nintestine delays the postprandial hyperglycemia by blocking the conversion of disaccharides into monosaccharides. There are only two marketed available \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors i.e., acarbose and miglitol and therefore, there is an open field for the discovery of NMEs exploiting the natural resources. The BUAE significantly inhibited \u03b1-glucosidase with the lowest IC50 value 0.21 \u00b1 0.09 mg.mL-1, followed by HEAE and HAAE. It was found through literature that the antidiabetic effects of the sample extract were owing to the ability of hydrolyzable tannins to block glucose intestinal epithelial uptake, glycogen, and lipid synthesis [41].\nThe urease is a virulence factor in human and animal pathogens that can cause kidney\nstones, pyelonephritis, peptic ulcers, urolithiasis, hepatic encephalopathy, and hepatic coma\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0266094.g011\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0266094.g012\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0266094 March 31, 2022 14 / 22\n[42]. The urease inhibitor prevents microorganisms from catalyzing urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide creating unfavorable conditions for their survival by restricting their major source of energy and nitrogen. This anti urease potential creates a good antimicrobial therapeutic option. The urease inhibitors have recently attracted attention owing to their anti-ulcerative potential [43]. Moreover, the recent increase in microbial antibiotic resistance and poor patient compliance necessitates the discovery of new inhibitors with better effectiveness and simpler regimens[44]. The anti-urease inhibitory potential was observed as BUAE > HAAE > HEAE> CFAE. The urease inhibitory activity of the BUAE may be attributed to the presence of hydrolyzable tannins and phenolic acids. The anti-urease activity of hydrolyzable tannin\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0266094.g013\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0266094.g014\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0266094 March 31, 2022 15 / 22\nwas due to the hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions with the active site of urease [45]. A well-known flavanol i.e., quercetin, showed significant antioxidant, anticancer, antiinflammatory, and antiviral activities. It has been considered therapeutically for its gastro-protective effects, inhibition of carcinogenicity, and reduction in the risk of cataracts. The allergic and anti-inflammatory response of quercetin was mediated by suppressing leukotriene production [46]. The corilagin inhibited glucose-6-phosphatase, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, and \u03b1-glucosidase [47]. These natural antioxidants may be promising drug candidates against various allergic and inflammatory conditions, metabolic disorders, and cancers. The quinic acid showed anticarcinogenic properties by up-regulating the cellular antioxidant enzymes and\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0266094.g015\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0266094.g016\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0266094 March 31, 2022 16 / 22\nprotecting them against the TPA-induced carcinogenesis [48]. The scopoletin a phenolic coumarin, inhibited the growth of breast and colon cancer cell lines [49, 50].\nThe high antioxidant activity of high molecular weight tannins was attributed to the num-\nber of phenolic\u2013OH groups. The literature review revealed that casuarinin a hydrolyzable tannin isolated from T. arjuna was effective against lung cancer [51]."
