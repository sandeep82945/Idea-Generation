    "abstractText": "We investigated the functional mechanism of long non-coding small nucleolar host gene 17 (SNHG17) in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). lncRNAs related to the prognosis of patients with DLBCL were screened to analyze long non-coding small nucleolar host gene 17 (SNHG17) expression in DLBCL and normal tissues, and a nomogram established for predicting DLBCL prognosis. SNHG17 expression in B-cell lymphoma cells was detected using qPCR. The effects of SNHG17 with/without doxorubicin on the proliferation and apoptosis of DoHH2 and Daudi were detected. The effects of combined SNHG17 and doxorubicin were analyzed. The regulatory function of SNHG17 in DLBCL was investigated using a mouse tumor xenotransplantation model. RNA sequencing was used to analyze the signaling pathways involved in SNHG17 knockdown in B-cell lymphoma cell lines. The target relationships among SNHG17, microRNA, and downstream mRNA biomolecules were detected. A higher SNHG17 level predicted a lower survival rate. SNHG17 was highly expressed in DLBCL patient tissues and cell lines. We established a prognostic model containing SNHG17 expression, which could effectively predict the overall survival rate of DLBCL patients. SNHG17 knockdown inhibited the proliferation and induced the apoptosis of B-cell lymphoma cells, and the combination of SNHG17 and doxorubicin had a synergistic effect. SNHG17, miR-34a-5p, and ZESTE gene enhancer homolog 2 (EZH2) had common hypothetical binding sites, and the luciferase reporter assay verified that miR-34a-5p was the direct target of SNHG17, and EZH2 was the direct target of miR-34a-5p. The carcinogenic function of SNHG17 in the proliferation and apoptosis of DLBCL cells was partially reversed by a miR-34a-5p inhibitor. SNHG17 increases EZH2 levels by inhibiting miR-34a5p. Our findings indicate SNHG17 as critical for promoting DLBCL progression by regulating PLOS ONE PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0294729 November 21, 2023 1 / 18 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111",

            "text": "Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, accounting for approximately 30\u201340% of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma cases. DLBCL is a highly invasive and heterogeneous malignant proliferative disease of the lymphatic system, comprising complex clinical manifestations, morphology, immune typing, and molecular genetic characteristics [1]. Recently, the incidence of DLBCL has gradually increased. For example, in China, the incidence of lymphoma is 2.9/100,000 [2]. Currently, chemotherapy drugs such as rituximab, cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) remain the cornerstone of DLBCL chemotherapy, but their curative effect is limited. Furthermore, the cure rate of adult DLBCL patients treated with chemotherapy alone is less than 40%, and the prognosis of older patients is poor. The main reason for this is tumor drug resistance [3]. Therefore, exploring the molecular mechanisms of DLBCL progression to develop more effective treatment strategies is very important.\nLong non-coding RNA (lncRNAs) are RNA molecules with a length of more than 200\nnucleotides. Although it lacks an open reading frame and does not have or has limited protein-coding ability [4, 5], many studies have shown that lncRNA can play a role in gene transcription and translation. The role affects the occurrence and development of tumors [6\u20138]. The malignant phenotype of tumors is closely related to various lncRNAs [9, 10]. lncRNAs can regulate the carcinogenic and tumor-suppressive pathways by competitively binding to miRNAs [11, 12] as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs). For example, HNF1A-AS1 is induced by MYC and promotes glioma progression via miR-32-5p/SOX4 [13]. lncRNAARHGAP18 promotes tumor metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma through miR-153-5p [14].\nlncRNA small nucleolar RNA host genes (SNHGs), a subset of long RNA, are spliced from\nthe exons of the primary RNA transcripts of SNHGs and transported to the cytoplasm. They are abnormally expressed in cancer and participate in cell proliferation, tumor progression, metastasis, and chemoresistance [15]. Various SNHGs have been reported to be involved in cancer progression [16\u201318]. For example, small nucleolar host gene 17 (SNHG17) can cause carcinogenesis in gastric cancer [19], colorectal cancer [20], non-small cell lung cancer [21], oral squamous cell carcinoma [22], and breast cancer [23]. However, the roles of SNHG17 in various tumors differ. In addition, the correlation between SNHG17 and DLBCL is unclear, and its potential mechanism has not been investigated. Therefore, understanding the expression pattern and regulatory mechanism of SNHG17 may help identify new prognostic markers and potential therapeutic targets for DLBCL.\nMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a small subclass of short non-coding RNA composed of approx-\nimately 22 nucleotides [24]. To date, miRNAs have been shown to regulate cellular activities associated with cancer development, including proliferation, apoptosis, and escape from antitumor immune responses [25, 26]. miRNAs target the 3\u2019- untranslated region (3\u2019-UTR) of mRNA through base pairing, blocking and degrading the translation of target genes and preventing the production of functional proteins. miRNAs are considered inhibitors of gene expression [27, 28]. For example, miR-21 inhibits breast tumorigenesis and angiogenesis by targeting the VEGF/VEGFR2/HIF-1 \u03b1 axis [29]. microRNA-139 can inhibit the progression of liver cancer by negatively regulating KPNA2 [30]. miR-34a-5p has been investigated in ovarian cancer [31], cervical cancer [32], and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma [33] and is\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0294729 November 21, 2023 2 / 18\nFunding: This study was supported by grants from the Natural Science Foundation of Guangxi (2018GXNSFBA281026, 2019GXNSFAA245086), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (82260042).the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2020M673555XB), and the \u201cFuture academic star\" of Guangxi Medical University (WLXSZX22109).

Our results showed that SNHG17 knockdown significantly reduced the semi-inhibitory DOX concentration in DoHH2 and Daudi cells (Fig 4)."

            "text": "GSEA was used to analyze the signaling pathways involved in the enrichment of low SNHG17 expression in clinical samples and SNHG17 knockdown in cell line samples. The results showed that SNHG17 participates in many key pathways in the occurrence and development of tumors. A total of 507 signal pathways were enriched in the clinical sample data, and 911 signal pathways were enriched in the cell sample data, of which 21 signal pathways were jointly involved in the above clinical samples and cell line samples (Fig 5A). The NES values of the same signal path of the two samples were added, sorted according to the absolute value of the NES, and displayed with a bar graph. The top three signal paths include EZH2_ Targets, MYB_ Targets, and Natural_ Killer_ Differentiation (Fig 5B).\nSearching for bridge biomolecules between SNHG17 and EZH2\nUsing Diana tools (https://diana.e-ce.uth.gr/lncbasev3/interactions), 21 putative binding sites of miRNA and SNHG17 were predicted, such as miR-101-3p, miR-34a-5p, and miR-17-5p. Using Starbase v2.0 (https://starbase.sysu.edu.cn/starbase2/browseIntersectTargetSite.php), five putative binding sites of miRNA and EZH2 were predicted, such as miR-34a-5p and miR101-3p. Considering the intersection of the miRNAs predicted by the above two databases, it can be concluded that the two miRNAs may bind to SNHG17 and EZH2 simultaneously, as shown in the Venn diagram (Fig 5C). Furthermore, qPCR showed that the expression of miR34a-5p and miR-101-3p was significantly downregulated in DLBCL cells compared with that\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0294729.g004\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0294729 November 21, 2023 10 / 18\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0294729 November 21, 2023 11 / 18\nin PBMC (Fig 5D\u2160 and 5D\u2161). Since the expression of miR-101-3p was too low in lymphoma cells, we verified the functional expression of miR-34a-5p in DLBCL cells.\nmiR-34a-5p is the direct target of SNHG17; miR-34a-5p inhibitor reversed the inhibitory effect of SNHG17 knockdown on lymphoma cells\nAccording to miRDB (http://mirdb.org/) and the MiRbase database (https://mirbase.org/ index.shtml), it is predicted that SNHG17 is a regulator of miR-34a-5p. We found that SNHG17 and miR-34a-5p shared a common hypothetical binding site (Fig 5E). The doubleluciferase reporter assay confirmed this prediction. Transfection of miR-34a-5p decreased the luciferase activity of SNHG17-WT cells (P < 0.01), but no significant effect was observed in SNHG17-MUT cells (Fig 5F\u2160 and 5\u2161).qPCR results showed that compared with PBMC, the expression of miR-34a-5p in DLBCL cells was significantly downregulated (Fig 5D). In addition, SNHG17 knockdown increased the expression of miR-34a-5p in DoHH2 cells (Fig 5G). This result indicated that miR-34a-5p is negatively regulated by SNHG17 in this cell line.\nmiR-34a-5p inhibitor can reverse the effects of SNHG17 knockdown on lymphoma cell proliferation and apoptosis\nWe investigated whether SNHG17 regulates DLBCL progression by inhibiting miR-34a-5p. CCK-8 results showed that downregulating SNHG17 in DoHH2 and Daudi cells could significantly inhibit cell proliferation, while miR-34a-5p inhibitor could partially rescue cell proliferation (Fig 5H\u2160 and 5H\u2161). We also investigated the role of SNHG17/miR-34a-5p in apoptosis. Compared with the control group, DoHH2 and Daudi cells transfected with sh-SNHG17 showed a higher apoptosis rate, while the miR-34a-5p inhibitor significantly reversed the DoHH2 and Daudi cell apoptosis caused by SNHG17 knockdown (Fig 5I). Therefore, SNHG17 may regulate the proliferation and apoptosis of DLBCL cells by negatively regulating miR-34a-5p.\nEZH2 is highly expressed in lymphoma cells and is negatively regulated by SNHG17\nEZH2 and miR-34a-5p shared a common putative binding site (Fig 6A). The double luciferase reporter assay confirmed this prediction. Transfection of miR-34a-5p decreased the luciferase activity of EZH2-WT cells (P< 0.01), but no significant effect was observed in EZH2-MUT cells (Fig 6B\u2160 and 6B\u2161). In addition, overexpression of miR-34a-5p decreased EZH2 expression, whereas EZH2 was highly expressed in lymphoma cells (Fig 6C\u2160 and 6C\u2161s). These results indicated that miR-34a-5p negatively regulates EZH2. To understand whether miR-34a-5p affects the EZH2 pathway, we detected EZH2 protein expression after miR-34a-5p overexpression in lymphoma cells by western blotting (Fig 6D\u2160 and 6D\u2161). The miR-34a-5p inhibitor significantly reversed the inhibitory action of EZH2 in DoHH2 and Daudi cells caused by SNHG17 knockdown (Fig 6E and 6F).\nDouble luciferase reporter was used to confirm the binding.

            "text": "DLBCL is a group of B-cell lymphomas with strong heterogeneity in molecular pathology and cytogenetics. Pathologically, it is characterized by a diffuse distribution of malignant large B lymphocytes, and clinically, it shows an aggressive course. Recently, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immune checkpoint inhibitors have been used in clinical treatment; however, the prognosis of lymphoma remains poor. Although some mechanisms have been reported, the molecular characteristics of the pathogenesis of most lymphomas remain unclear. Many studies have shown that lncRNAs play important roles in the pathogenesis and development of many cancers [36]. Therefore, it is important to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of prognosis-related lncRNAs and explore potential therapeutic targets.\nIn this study, through high-throughput data and bioinformatics analysis, we found that\nSNHG17 was highly expressed in lymphoma tissues and cells and negatively correlated with the survival of patients with lymphoma. Loss of function analysis showed that SNHG17 knockdown could inhibit the proliferation of lymphoma cells (DoHH2 and Daudi) and synergistically affect DOX by inhibiting cell proliferation. SNHG17 knockdown also promotes cell apoptosis. In addition, we demonstrated for the first time that SNHG17 knockdown could enhance the sensitivity of lymphoma cells to DOX. However, as an oncogene involved in tumor progression, the mechanism by which SNHG17 is involved in lymphoma progression\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0294729.g006\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0294729 November 21, 2023 13 / 18\nremains unclear. According to previous studies, lncRNAs can interfere with miRNA\u2013mRNA interactions by adsorbing miRNAs. miRNAs participate in various biological processes by cleaving target gene mRNA or inhibiting sequence-specific translation, including cell growth, differentiation, development, and apoptosis [37, 38]. For example, lncRNA SNHG17 promotes the progression of pancreatic cancer through cross-dialogue with miR-942 [39], and SNHG17 promotes the progression of cervical cancer by targeting microRNA-375-3p [40]. Studies have shown that tumor-related fibroblasts promote the proliferation and metastasis of oral cancer cells through exosome-mediated paracrine miR-34a-5p [41]. LncRNA 1700020I14Rik reduces cell proliferation and fibrosis via the miR-34a-5p/Sirt1/HIF-1\u03b1 signaling pathway in diabetic nephropathy [42]. Our results showed that miR-34a-5p has a strong affinity for SNHG17. Overexpression of miR-34a-5p inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis of DLBCL cells, while SNHG17 knockdown and co-expression of miR-34a-5p attenuated this effect, indicating that SNHG17 could affect the proliferation of DLBCL cells by adsorbing miR-34a-5p. Bioinformatics and luciferase reporter gene analyses showed that SNHG17 played a carcinogenic role in DLBCL as a miRNA sponge, and there was an interaction between SNHG17 and miR-34a-5p. These results strongly suggested that miR-34a-5p is a direct target of SNHG17. However, the molecular mechanism by which miR-34a-5p inhibits tumor growth remains unclear.\nIn this study, we predicted the putative binding sites of miR-34a-5p and EZH2 using bioin-\nformatics analysis, and this hypothesis was verified through luciferase reporter gene analysis. Early studies have found that EZH2 mutations are associated with Bcl-2 rearrangement in follicular lymphoma. Be\u0301guelin et al. investigated the relationship between DLBCL and Bcl-2 and found that mutant EZH2 had a stronger inhibitory effect on differentiating B-cell lymphoma cells. If it interacts with Bcl-2, it promotes the malignant transformation of germinal heart B cells. Combined with a Bcl-2 inhibitor, it can enhance the effect of EZH2 inhibitors [43, 44]. EZH2 is a catalytic subunit of the PRC2 protein complex that mediates the transcriptional silencing of target genes through 2/3 subunit methylation of H3K27 (H3K27me2/3) [45, 46]. Many studies have shown that EZH2 can activate the transcription of some lncRNAs in tumor cells [47] and plays a key role in the occurrence, progression, proliferation, and apoptosis of tumors [48]. Relevant studies have found that EZH2 is significantly overexpressed in lymphoid malignancies [49], gastric cancer [50], and uveal melanoma [51]. These results suggest that EZH2 mediates the regulation of SNHG17 during the immune escape and progression of DLBCL cells. However, the interaction between EZH2 and miR-34a-5p in malignant tumors has not yet been reported. Our study confirmed for the first time that EZH2 was upregulated in lymphoma cells and negatively correlated with miR-34a-5p and proposed that the upstream target gene SNHG17 regulates the downstream EZH2 signaling pathway by adsorbing miR34a-5p, which is probably the reason for the resistance of lymphoma cells to DOX. SNHG17 knockdown inhibited EZH2 expression, while miR-34a-5p overexpression weakened this trend, suggesting that the SNHG17/miR-34a-5p axis may affect the biological function of lymphoid cancer cells and tumor development by regulating the activity of the EZH2 signaling pathway. Therefore, SNHG17 regulates the proliferation, apoptosis, and drug sensitivity of lymphoma cells by interacting with miR-34a-5p/EZH2.\nIn conclusion, our study found that SNHG17, a ceRNA, upregulated EZH2 expression and\nregulated the proliferation and apoptosis of DLBCL cells by adsorbing miR-34a-5p. Notably, these findings may provide a theoretical basis for SNHG17 as a new therapeutic target for the treatment of DLBCL. However, the main limitations of the current study are the lack of in vivo data and clinical evidence, which require further research.\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0294729 November 21, 2023 14 / 18"
