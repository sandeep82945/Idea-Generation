    "abstractText": "Recently we have proposed a simple method for obtaining the parameters of a ligand field multiplet model for L-edge spectra calculations from density functional theory. Here we generalize the method to systems where the metal site has arbitrary point symmetry. The ligand field-induced splitting of the metal d-level becomes a hermitian matrix with cross-terms between the different d-orbitals. The anisotropy of the covalency is fully taken into account and it rescales the electron\u2013 electron interaction and the oscillator strength in an orbital-dependent way. We apply the method to polarization-dependent V L-edge spectra of vanadium pentoxide and obtain very good agreement with the experiment.",

            "text": "Ligand field multiplet theory (LFMT) is the standard method for analyzing optical and X-ray spectra involving transition to 3d and 4f valence shells in transition metal and rare-earth compounds [1]. It is an invaluable tool for coordination chemistry, photochemistry and X-ray absorption spectroscopy [2,3]. LFMT is based on a single ion model, where intra-atomic electron\u2013electron interactions are accurately described by using a multiconfigurational wave function. The perturbation by the rest system is reduced to a local potential, the ligand field (LF) acting on the metal atom. The LF splits the 2l + 1-fold orbitally degenerate free atom shell with angular momentum l, into several sub-levels, according to the point symmetry at the metal center. The LF splitting can be described by a few independent parameters. In the case of a transition metal ion in cubic symmetry, for example, the 3d-level splits into three-fold (t2g) and two-fold (eg) sub-levels, whose energy difference corresponds to the LF parameter 10Dq. Despite its simplicity, LFMT has been very successful in reproducing experimental spectra, and provides important insight into the electronic and magnetic state of the metal center. The major drawback of the method is that it relies on empirical parameters, namely the LF energy splittings and a reduction parameter of the Coulomb integrals, which accounts for partial delocalization of the atomic orbitals by ligand bonding (also known as the nephelauxetic effect [4]). Various schemes have been presented for extracting LF parameters from ab initio calculations [5\u20137]. Most of these methods focus on the weak ligand field of rare-earth 4 f shells and/or are tied to specific quantum chemistry codes, e.g., ADF [8]. As a result, they have not found wide-spread use in the community of X-ray spectroscopists, who still largely rely on adjusting the LF parameters to the experimental spectra. Since the number of LF parameters increases with decreasing symmetry, the need for non-empirical parameter determination is particularly strong for low symmetry systems. Indeed, while in octahedral symmetry, there is only one LF parameter (10Dq), the number of independent parameters rises to 14 for the lowest possible symmetry (C1 group). Additionally, Coulomb integral reduction factors are needed to describe the nephelauxetic effect. If the anisotropy of the covalency is to be taken\nSymmetry 2023, 15, 472. https://doi.org/10.3390/sym15020472 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/symmetry\naccount of, the number of independent reduction parameters can be as large as 15 (for C1 symmetry), which would give a total of 29 independent parameters. It is clear that fitting such a large number of empirical parameters to a single experimental X-ray absorption spectrum is both mathematically ill-defined and physically meaningless. Metal ions at low symmetry sites are very common in catalytic active systems and biological molecules. When empirical LFMT is applied to such systems, an approximate, higher point symmetry is often assumed [9] without theoretical justification and with uncertain outcome. In Ref. [10] we have presented a simple, non-empirical scheme for obtaining the LF parameters ab initio from the output of standard density functional theory (DFT) codes. The anisotropy of the nephelauxetic effect has also been taken into account. These features were implemented in a home-written LFMT code [11]. The method was tested on transition metal monoxide crystals and metal phthalocyanine molecules and good results were obtained in all cases [10]. In those examples, the point symmetry was high (Oh or D4h), such that the five d-orbitals are not mixed by the LF, i.e., the LF matrix is diagonal. This fact justified a number of simplifying theoretical assumptions that were made in [10], but which do not hold in the case of arbitrarily low symmetry. Here we generalize the method of Ref. [10] to arbitrary symmetry and successfully apply it to the V L-edge spectra of V2O5 where the metal site has very low symmetry (Cs)."

            "text": "We consider a single metal atom center in a molecular or solid system, whose valence orbitals are \u03c8k(r) = \u3008r|k\u3009with energy Ek. Throughout this paper we assume a non-magnetic ground state and suppress the spin quantum number. The theory can easily be extended to allow for a possible spin-dependence of the LF in magnetic systems. In the LFMT we focus on the valence l-shell (l = 2 or 3) of the atom with its 2l + 1 orbitals |m\u3009, m = 1, . . . 2l + 1. The molecular orbitals |k\u3009 are projected on the l-shell atomic orbitals:\n|k\u3009 = \u2211 m |m\u3009\u3008m|k\u3009+ |k\u0303\u3009 (1)\nwhere |k\u0303\u3009 is the ligand part of the molecular orbital, or more precisely, all of the rest of the molecular orbital without the atomic l-part. We define a metal-l projection matrix as\nNmm\u2032 = \u2032\n\u2211 k \u3008m|k\u3009\u3008k|m\u2032\u3009 . (2)\nThe primed sum runs over all eigenstates |k\u3009 with eigenvalues Ek in a finite energy range (E1, E2), which must include the valence orbitals of predominant metal-l character. At present, the energy range must be chosen by hand for each system upon inspection of the density of states. This is similar to choosing the energy interval that defines the \u201cactive space\u201d in quantum chemistry methods such as CAS-SCF [12]. Obviously, the set of molecular orbitals in the chosen interval must contain a non-zero contribution of each m-orbital, such that \u2211\u2032k |\u3008m|k\u3009|2 > 0 for all m. As a consequence, N is a positive definite hermitian matrix, with strictly positive eigenvalues \u03bbn. We may write Nmm\u2032 = \u2211n Umn\u03bbnU\u2020nm\u2032 , where the unitarian matrix U collects the normalized eigenvectors of N. We define the covalency matrix as:\nA \u2261 N1/2 (3)\nand have: Amm\u2032 = \u2211\nn Umn\u03b1nU\u2020nm\u2032 , (4)\nwhere \u03b1n \u2261 \u221a \u03bbn. By putting\nTmm\u2032 \u2261 \u2032\n\u2211 k \u3008m|k\u3009Ek\u3008k|m\u2032\u3009 , (5)\nwe define the ligand field matrix \u2206 as:\n\u2206 = A\u22121 T A\u22121 . (6)\nThese definitions are consistent with [10]. Indeed, if the point symmetry is high enough such that there is a representation {|m\u3009} in which the five d-orbitals do not mix, then, for each molecular orbital |k\u3009, we have \u3008m|k\u3009 6= 0 at most for one m. In this case, N in Equation (2) and T in Equation (5) are obviously diagonal matrices. It follows that U is the identity matrix and that A and \u2206 are also diagonal. Then Equation (6) reduces to \u2206mm\u2032 = \u03b4mm\u2032em, with em = \u03b1\u22122m \u2211 \u2032 k Ek|\u3008m|k\u3009|2 in agreement with [10]. It is easy to see that if the symmetry is high, but the d-orbitals {|m\u3009} are chosen arbitrarily, i.e., not as representations of the local point group, then Equations (2)\u2013(6) still give the correct LF as in [10]. This is shown in detail in Appendix A. When the local symmetry is low, then there is no natural d-orbital basis {|m\u3009} in which the LF is diagonal. In general, both A and \u2206 are full matrices. We note that since both A and \u2206 are hermitian, an orthogonal basis can always be found, which brings either of them into diagonal form, but the bases for A and \u2206 will in general be different. More importantly, these bases are not solely determined by symmetry, but will depend on the details of the electronic structure (Ek and \u3008m|k\u3009). Next we consider the electron\u2013electron Coulomb integrals and their reduction due to valence orbital covalency, i.e., the nephelauxetic effect [4]. Usually, all Slater\u2013Condon integrals are rescaled by a single, empirical scaling factor \u03ba, typically taken in the range 0.5\u20131 [2]. However, using a single scaling factor neglects the different degree of covalency for the different d-orbitals, occurring, e.g., between those making pd\u03c3 metal\u2013ligand bonds and those making pd\u03c0 bonds. In [10] we have taken this anisotropy effect into account by introducing orbital-dependent scaling factors \u03ba1234, where the indices are shorthand for the quantum numbers lm of the four orbitals entering a Coulomb integral, i.e., V1234 \u2261 \u3008l1m1, l2m2|V|l3m3, l4m4\u3009. We have used:\nV1234 = \u03ba1234VHF1234 , \u03ba1234 = 0.9\u03b11\u03b12\u03b13\u03b14 , (7)\nwhere VHF1234 are the single-ion Hartree\u2013Fock Coulomb integrals and \u03b1i is the covalency factor of the i = (lm)-orbital. The overall factor 0.9 was introduced to take account of the fact that a reduction of the Hartree\u2013Fock values of about 10% is needed even in free atoms, because of configuration interaction effects [13]. For core-orbitals, there is no covalency and we put \u03b1i = 1. For valence orbitals, the \u03b1 values are computed from the band structure and Equations (2)\u2013(4). The expressions (7) are only valid for high symmetry, when the covalency matrix A is diagonal.

For high-point symmetry we have A11\u2032 = \u03b11\u03b411\u2032 , and so Equations (8) and (9) immediately simplify to Equation (7). In the general case, when A is non-diagonal, Equations (8) and (9) are also valid. This is proven in Appendix B. Note that for core orbitals, we have A11\u2032 = \u03b411\u2032 whatever the symmetry. The covalency of the valence orbitals also reduces the optical transition matrix elements and thus the oscillator strengths. This effect was neglected in [10] but will be taken into account here. The bare dipole operator for q-polarized light is denoted as Dq, and Dq = rq in dipole length form. The matrix elements between the 2p core and the 3d valence states\nare \u30083dm|Dq|2pm\u2032\u3009. The covalency corrected dipole operator is denoted as Dcq. Similarly to the case of the Coulomb integrals, the rescaled matrix elements are given by:\n\u3008dm|Dcq|pm\u2032\u3009 = \u2211 m\u2032\u2032 Amm\u2032\u2032\u3008dm\u2032\u2032|Dq|pm\u2032\u3009 . (10)\nWe finish this section by noting that the present approach is very general. It can be applied in its present from to any transition metal compound or molecule with arbitrary symmetry. The only requirement is to have performed a DFT ground state calculation of the system. For computing the ligand field, only the Kohn\u2013Sham energies Ek and the complex amplitudes \u3008dm|k\u3009 are needed. Here, |k\u3009 denotes the Kohn\u2013Sham wave function and |dm\u3009 a d-like valence orbital on a transition metal site. Amplitudes such as \u3008dm|k\u3009 are obtained by projecting the Kohn\u2013Sham orbitals on atomic-centered local orbitals and are provided in most DFT codes (e.g., in the PROCAR file in VASP)."

            "text": "We apply the theory to the V L-edge spectra of V2O5, whose orthorhombic crystal structure is shown in Figure 1. The V site has a strongly distorted octahedral VO6 coordination, with one short vanadyl (V=O) bond along z, four V-O bonds of intermediate length in the xy-plane and one very long V-O bond opposite of the vanadyl bond. The electronic structure of bulk V2O5 has been computed using DFT in the local density approximation with the plane-wave code VASP [14]. The experimental crystal structure was used. In the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method, the plane-wave cut-off was set to 500 eV and the Brillouin zone was sampled with a 4 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 8 Monkhorst\u2013Pack mesh. For the V atomic radius, which is needed for the projection of the Kohn\u2013Sham orbitals onto the V-d orbitals, the default value in the PAW potential file (1.323 \u00c5) was used. The V-d partial density of states (DOS) projected onto the usual cubic d-orbitals is shown in Figure 2.\nThe point symmetry at the V site is very low (Cs) such that all five d-orbitals have a different DOS and thus a different LF energy. The point group Cs has only one symmetry operation, namely the mirror \u03c3(y), and the d-orbitals fall into the two irreducible representations A\u2032 = {3z2 \u2212 r2, x2 \u2212 y2, xz} and A\u2032\u2032 = {xy, yz}. The orbitals within each\ngroup can mix. As a consequence, the LF matrix is non-diagonal and has eight independent parameters (which excludes the average d-level energy).\nFor the calculation of the LF and Coulomb integral reduction factors in Equations (2)\u2013(9), we need the eigenenergies Ek and the metal d-wave amplitudes \u3008m|k\u3009 where |k\u3009 \u2261 |nk\u3009 is a band state, with k the crystal momentum in the first Brillouin zone and n being the band index. Ek and \u3008m|k\u3009 are directly taken from the DFT band structure (VASP PROCAR file). For the sums over k, all k points and the whole conduction band are used, i.e., the energy interval is 1 eV < Ek < 6.5 eV (see Figure 2). The calculated matrices N, A and \u2206 are given in Table 1. As anticipated by the symmetry analysis, there are non-zero non-diagonal matrix elements between the different orbitals of A\u2032 symmetry {3z2 \u2212 r2, xz, x2 \u2212 y2} and between those of A\u2032\u2032 symmetry {xy, yz}. In the present case, the non-diagonal matrix elements are small. For the covalency matrix A, the non-diagonal matrix elements are about 100 times smaller than the diagonal ones. For the LF matrix \u2206 the non-diagonal elements are roughly 10 times smaller than the corresponding level splittings, e.g., the splitting between xy and yz is 1.1 eV and the non-diagonal term is 0.1 eV. We also note that the diagonal matrix elements for yz and xz are nearly the same. This means that, although the exact point symmetry of the metal site is Cs, it may be reasonable to approximate the LF using the higher symmetry group C4v where the d-level splits into only four sub-levels (b2 = xy, e = {xz, yz}, a1 = 3z2 \u2212 r2 and b1 = x2 \u2212 y2) and there are no non-diagonal terms. Approximate point symmetries are often used in LFMT [9]. With the present method, by looking at \u2206 and A, one can easily check whether such an approximation is valid. The five ligand field levels (diagonal matrix elements in \u2206 of Table 1) are indicated in Figure 2 as vertical bars above the DOS plot. It can be seen that the levels correspond well to the centers of different DOS distributions. The calculated V L-edge absorption spectra for linearly polarized light along the three crystal axes are shown in Figure 3. There is only a tiny difference between the x and y polarization, which is expected from the fact that the LF has approximately C4v symmetry as noticed above. However, the z-polarized spectra are very different from the x, y-spectra, which reflects the layered structure of V2O5 and the strong anisotropy of the VO6 octahedra, due to the vanadyl bond oriented along z [15]. The ligand field energies of the five V-3d orbitals increase in the order xy, yz,zx, x2 \u2212 y2, 3z2 \u2212 r2; see Table 1. The finding that the t2g-like orbitals (xy,yz,zx) are lower than the eg-like ones (x2 \u2212 y2, 3z2 \u2212 r2) is typical for octahedral coordination and it reflects the fact that the V-3d\u2013O-2p bonds of \u03c3-type that involve the eg-like d-orbitals are stronger than the \u03c0-bonds made by the t2g-like orbitals.\nIt is remarkable, however, that the ligand field level of xy is about 1 eV lower than that of yz, zx, which suggests that the \u03c0-bonding of the xy-orbital is particularly weak. The xy-level is responsible for the lowest energy peak in the L-edge spectra (at 1 eV in Figure 3), as can be inferred from the peak energy and polarization dependence. Indeed, the fact that this peak vanishes for z-polarized light (see Figure 3) clearly indicates in-plane orientation of the orbital [15]. We also note that the 3z2 \u2212 r2 orbital has the largest ligand field level, which means that the antibonding molecular orbitals that are formed by the V-3d and O-2p states are most strongly hybridized in the case of the V 3z2 \u2212 r2 orbital, which makes the V=O vanadyl bond. This shows that the vanadyl bond, even though it involves only one O ligand atom, is much stronger than any other V-O bond, and even stronger than the four V-O \u03c3 bonds that are formed by the x2 \u2212 y2 orbital combined. The bond strengths of the different V-3d orbitals are closely related to their covalency. We may characterize the covalency (or hybridization) of an orbital |dm\u3009 by the quantity cm = 1\u2212 \u03b12m. In the present case, where the off-diagonal elements of A are very small, we have \u03b1m \u2248 Amm and thus cm \u2248 1\u2212 A2mm \u2248 1\u2212 Nmm. From Table 1, the cm values are: 0.26 (xy), 0.34 (yz,xz), 0.33 (x2 \u2212 y2), 0.48 (3z2 \u2212 r2). Clearly, the xy-orbital is the least hybridized, indicating an almost non-bonding state, while 3z2 \u2212 r2 is most strongly hybridized, which reflects the strongly covalent vanadyl double bond.\nAs explained above, the reduction of Coulomb integrals is taken into account in an orbital-dependent way. The larger the hybridization of an orbital |dm\u3009 (i.e., the smaller \u03b1m), the smaller is \u03ba in Equation (7), i.e., the stronger is the reduction of the Coulomb integrals. For example, the 2p\u2212 3d Coulomb integrals for the 3z2 \u2212 r2 orbital are reduced by 48%, while those with the xy-orbitals are reduced only by 26%. For the 3d\u2212 3d Coulomb integrals where \u03ba \u221d \u03b14, the effect is even stronger [10], but in the present case of a V5+-ion with 3d0 ground and 2p53d1 final states, the 3d\u2212 3d integrals do not enter the calculation. Previously we have shown that taking into account the orbital dependence of the Coulomb integrals in ligand field multiplet calculations improves the agreement of the spectra with experiments (i.e., for CoO, NiO) although the effect is rather small [10]. The oscillator strengths are also modified by the orbital-dependent covalency factors; see Equation (10). Here, this effect is taken into account for the first time. The reduction of the oscillator strength is given by 1\u2212 \u03b12m, which is maximum for the 3z2 \u2212 r2-orbital (48%). This decreases the relative weight of the two dominant peaks (at \u223c5 eV and \u223c11.5 eV in Figure 3) and it improves agreement with experiments, as we have checked.\nIn Figure 4 we compare calculated spectra with experimental data [16] for p-polarized light incident at an angle of 90\u25e6 or 30\u25e6 from the surface plane. It is seen that the experimental L2-peak (with maximum at 525 eV) is much broader than the L3-peak (with a maximum at 518 eV). This is not uncommon for light 3d elements because the 2p1/2 hole has a shorter lifetime than the 2p3/2 hole [17]. This is partly due to the L2L3M45 Auger decay, which reduces the lifetime of the 2p1/2 hole. In the case of V2O5, the fact that the oxygen K-edge (not shown) is only about 5 eV above the V-L2 peak may also play a role. The near resonance between the V-2p1/2 and the O-1s core levels might induce multi-atomic decay processes that further broaden the L2-peak. To account for the enhanced broadening of the L2-peak in a phenomenological way, we convoluted the spectra with a Lorenzian of energy-dependent FWHM, given by \u0393(E) = a(E\u2212 E0) + b, where E is the photon energy and E0 = 513.5 eV is the absorption threshold. We take a = 0.04, b = 0.15 eV, such that the FWHM is 0.33 eV at the L3 peak maximum and 0.61 eV at the L2 maximum. A similar broadening model was successfully used for the L-edge spectra of TiO2 [18]. The reason why we use a linearly increasing FWHM rather than two fixed values for L2 and L3 is that for light transition element there is strong configuration mixing between the two edges [18]. In Figure 4, the calculated spectra agree very well with the experimental ones. Almost all features seen in the data are also present in the calculation, except for the weak shoulder structure in the experimental spectrum at 519 eV. The energy positions and intensities of the various peaks differ a little and the L2-peak is broader in the experiment than in theory, but the overall agreement is remarkably good, in particular the differences between the 90\u25e6 and 30\u25e6 spectrum. The agreement between experiment and theory obtained here is at least as good as that obtained with quantum chemistry configuration interaction methods [16,19] and multichannel multiple scattering theory [15]. This means that parameterized LFMT can be as reliable and predictive as ab initio quantum chemistry approaches such as CAS-SCF [12] and RAS-SCF [16], if the LF parameters are computed using the present, non-empirical theory. The advantage of the present LFMT method is that it is simpler and computationally much lighter than those ab initio schemes, because we only need to perform the routine task of a DFT ground state calculation. Moreover, the present method can be applied to molecules [10] and solids in the same way. By contrast, when using quantum chemistry methods for the solid state, convergence with respect to cluster size is often a problem [16,19]. The present approach has some aspects in common with the\nparameterization of the LF multiplet model using Wannier functions [7,20]. The Wannier method is powerful and flexible, but more complicated than the present method, especially for the low symmetry systems considered here, where the construction of symmetry adapted Wannier functions may be challenging [21]."

            "text": "In summary, the recent method of non-empirical ligand field parameter determination of Ref. [10] has been generalized to systems of arbitrary symmetry. The ligand field levels and the covalency factors of the different d-orbitals become 5 \u00d7 5 matrices that have nonzero non-diagonal elements in case of low symmetry. For high symmetry, the present scheme reduces to [10]. The covalency of the d-orbitals rescales the Coulomb integrals and the oscillator strengths in an orbital-dependent way. The method has been applied to V2O5, which has a very low point symmetry (Cs). The calculated spectra agree very well with experiments, and the agreement is on the same level as full ab initio quantum chemistry approaches. The advantage of the present scheme is that it is computationally much simpler and that it can be easily implemented into parameterized LFMT codes, which are widely used for the analysis of L-edge spectra [3]. The present theory removes the major shortcoming of LFMT, i.e., the need for empirical parameters, while keeping its main advantages, namely conceptual simplicity and versatility at a low numerical cost.\nFunding: This research received no external funding.\nData Availability Statement: The data presented in this study are available on request from the corresponding author.\nConflicts of Interest: The authors declare no conflict of interest."

We call this symmetry-adapted local basis {|d\u0303n\u3009}. In this basis, the ligand field matrix is diagonal, and, according to Ref. [10], given by \u2206\u0303nn\u2032 = \u03b4nn\u2032en, where en = tn/\u03b12n with tn = \u2211 \u2032 k |\u3008d\u0303n|k\u3009|2Ek and \u03b12n = \u2211 \u2032 k |\u3008d\u0303n|k\u3009|2.\nWe now consider an arbitrary (global) d-orbital basis {|dm\u3009}, which is related to the local basis by a unitarian matrix U. We show that in the global basis, the ligand field matrix \u2206, defined by Equations (2), (5) and (6), is correctly given by \u2206 = U\u2206\u0303U\u2020. Proof. The local, symmetry-adapted d-orbitals form a representation of the point group. They are orthogonal and are taken as normalized, i.e., \u3008d\u0303n|d\u0303n\u2032\u3009 = \u03b4nn\u2032 (n, n\u2032 = 1 . . . 5). The eigenstates of the molecule can also be classified by the point group. The eigenstates that transform as |d\u0303n\u3009 are denoted as |kn\u3009 and their energy as Ekn (all other eigenstates do not mix with the d-states and can be disregarded). From the molecular eigenstates we project out the d-orbital component and write:\n|kn\u3009 = Ckn|d\u0303n\u3009+ |Lkn\u3009 , Ckn = \u3008d\u0303n|kn\u3009\nwhere |Lkn\u3009 is the ligand part of |kn\u3009. We have \u3008d\u0303n\u2032|Lkn\u3009 = 0 \u2200k, n, n\u2032. For n = n\u2032 this holds by definition (projection). When n 6= n\u2032, it follows from the fact that |d\u0303n\u2032\u3009 is orthogonal by symmetry to both |d\u0303n\u3009 and |kn\u3009. The local d-orbital basis and the global (arbitrary) basis are related by a rotation in Hilbert space:\n|d\u0303n\u3009 = \u2211 m |dm\u3009Umn\nwhere Umn = \u3008dm|d\u0303n\u3009 is a unitarian matrix.
