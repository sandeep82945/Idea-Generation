 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate the biological activities of the different tissues. Since the metabolite composition varies between flowers, flower buds, leaves and stems, it would be interesting to compare their pharmacological effects such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial activities. This could help determine which tissue has the most potent effects. 

2. Isolate and identify new compounds from the different tissues. The paper identified 171 known metabolites, but there may be novel compounds present as well. New isolation and structure elucidation studies could uncover unique bioactive molecules.

3. Study the gene expression and enzymatic regulation involved in metabolite biosynthesis. Understanding the transcriptional and enzymatic control of the phenylpropanoid, flavonoid and other pathways could provide insight into how the metabolite profiles are modulated in each tissue type. 

4. Investigate how growth conditions and environmental factors affect the metabolites. Growing the plants under different conditions (light, temperature, etc) and assessing the effects on the metabolite composition could reveal how certain compounds are influenced.

5. Evaluate the metabolites for specific pharmacological activities. Testing the extracts or pure compounds for particular bioactivities like anti-cancer, anti-diabetic, anti-Alzheimer's effects could demonstrate if certain tissues have compounds with targeted therapeutic potential.
