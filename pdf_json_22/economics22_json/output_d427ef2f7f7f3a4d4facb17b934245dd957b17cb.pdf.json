Based\non the theory of \u201cinformed intentions\u201d planned behavior and dual\ncognitive processing theory, this manuscript studies the relationship among\nentrepreneurial cognition, entrepreneurial intention, recognition perception\nof university entrepreneurship education, and entrepreneurial behavior from\nthe perspective of mass innovation and mass entrepreneurship in China. The\nhypotheses are tested using a hierarchical linear regression model based on\ndata from 786 valid questionnaires from more than 400 universities across\nChina. This study finds that student\u2019s entrepreneurial cognition positively\naffects their entrepreneurial behavior, and entrepreneurial intention plays a\nmediating role by positively strengthening the relationship between these two,\nand that the recognition perception of university entrepreneurship education\nstrengthens the positive relationship between entrepreneurial intention and\nentrepreneurial behavior. These findings provide a new perspective and\nframework for studying the entrepreneurial cognitive education of university\nstudents, and they have certain practical implications for the reform of\nentrepreneurship education in China.\nKEYWORDS\nentrepreneurship, higher educational institutions, cognition, intention, behavior\nIntroduction\nIn recent 20 years, with the rapid development of Internet economy across the worldwide, more and more people from all walks of life have joined the entrepreneurial army. According to relevant statistics, China\u2019s entrepreneurial activity is now foremost in the world, but the quality of entrepreneurship is not high, the success rate is relatively low, there are fewer highly educated entrepreneurs, and they are still concentrated in low-tech industries (China Entrepreneurship Research Center, 2013). A large-sample\nFrontiers in Psychology 01 frontiersin.org\nsurvey focused on entrepreneurship showed that 64.9% of Chinese college students have entrepreneurial ideas, but the proportion of successfully achieving the business goal is less than 20%. Also, their income is relatively low, nearly 70% of them have an average monthly income of less than 3,000 yuan, and 17.3% of the entrepreneurial projects run at a loss (Maxis Institute, 2014). Therefore, it is impossible to achieve entrepreneurial success with just entrepreneurial enthusiasm but no entrepreneurial ability (i.e., accurate understanding of entrepreneurial theory, direction, objectives, risks, implementation process, and sustainability evaluation). For successful entrepreneurship and social value growth, it is crucial to cultivate and improve individual entrepreneurial ability (Audretsch, 2007), which is why major countries have prioritized the cultivation and development entrepreneurial capabilities (Chen et al., 2014).\nAt present, under the guidance of a policy of the Chinese government- \u201cBasic Requirements for Entrepreneurship Education and Teaching in Ordinary Undergraduate Universities,\u201d most colleges and universities in China have consciously established theoretical and practical courses such as \u201cEntrepreneurship Management\u201d and \u201cEntrepreneurship and Employment Guidance\u201d to guide the entrepreneurial cognition and practice for college students. Taking the city of Wuhan in the province of Hubei as an example, 96% of colleges and universities there have established a course on entrepreneurship management, and government departments at all levels have implemented a series of preferential policies of Wuhan City Government- \u201cMillions of College Students to Stay in Wuhan for Starting a Business\u201d under the guidance of \u201cMass Entrepreneurship and Innovation.\u201d However, according to data from the Entrepreneurship Guidance Center of the Human Resources and Social Security Bureau, nearly 12% of Chinese students have the intention to start a business, while only 2% actually practice, which is in sharp contrast to the stable proportion of 20\u201330% in Western developed countries (Rongzhi and Hu, 2011). In recent years, many young students have been involved in entrepreneurship because of (i) the increasingly severe employment situation, (ii) the examples and influences of successful entrepreneurs, and (iii) the implementation of a series of preferential policies for innovation and entrepreneurship by university students. Therefore, the following questions arise. What are the common characteristics of university students will choose to start a business?

            "text": "Entrepreneurial cognition and entrepreneurial behavior\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, scholars beyond China pointed out the influence of entrepreneurial cognition (EC) on EB. Mitchell et al. (2002a) defined EC as \u201cthe knowledge structure used by entrepreneurs for evaluation, judgment and decision-making in the process of opportunity evaluation and entrepreneurial growth,\u201d and while studying entrepreneurship, Li et al. (2013) found that EC has a significant impact on entrepreneurial decision-making. Therefore, many colleges and universities in China now have an entrepreneurship management course for EE: this provides college-student entrepreneurs with theoretical knowledge about and practical experience of entrepreneurship through diversified education modes such as innovation and entrepreneurship competitions, social practice, enterprise practice, and project simulation, which are very important for improving their EC (Li et al., 2013). Therefore, the first purpose of the present study is to explore the specific impact of EC on EB.\nEntrepreneurial cognition and entrepreneurial intention\nMost empirical studies in China and elsewhere have shown that EI plays an important and prerequisite role in the entire process of individual EB (Xiu\u2019e and Kun, 2016), and as a classic concept in psychology, that of \u201cinformed intentions\u201d is often used in the moral education of college students. Entrepreneurship is a typical planned behavior. As an exogenous factor, entrepreneurial education (EE) in colleges and universities has been concerned with whether it is possible to enrich the self-awareness of entrepreneurship among college students by teaching entrepreneurial knowledge, thereby stimulating EI and encouraging EB (Bird, 1988). Also, researches have noted that entrepreneurship\u2014like other disciplines\u2014can be recognized and understood through learning (Bird, 1988). Many previous studies have also shown that EE has a certain positive impact on improving people\u2019s EI or entrepreneurial ability. Based on empirical research, the positive influence of entrepreneurship education on college students\u2019 entrepreneurial attitude and entrepreneurial self-efficacy has been discussed (Peter and Kennedy, 2003; Fayolle et al., 2006; Souitaris et al., 2007). Also, EE has a positive and significant\nFrontiers in Psychology 02 frontiersin.org\neffect on the formation of students\u2019 EI and entrepreneurial motivation has been reasoned (Li and Huiming, 2010). And via a questionnaire survey, it pointed out that EE has not only a direct effect on EI but also a significant impact on it with a generalized entrepreneurial attitude as an intermediate mechanism (Li and Huiming, 2010; Xiang and Lei, 2014). From the discussion above, it could be concluded that EE in colleges and universities actually involves cognitive education about entrepreneurship-related knowledge to stimulate the EI of college students through systematic cognitive education and then stimulate their EB. Therefore, another purpose of the present study is to explore whether EC also follows the psychological law of \u201ccognition\u2013emotion\u2013intention\u2013behavior,\u201d i.e., whether EC and EI are correlated positively.\nRecognition of college entrepreneurship education and entrepreneurial intention and behavior\nEI plays an important role in the whole process of the individual entrepreneurship of college students. However, from the perspective of the pre-factors affecting EI, it is not only determined by the EC acquired from EE in colleges and universities but also may be influenced by individual subjective attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control (Heuer and Kolvereid, 2014). In recent years, some studies have found that (i) EE has little effect on the entrepreneurial ability of college students and (ii) EE has no or even negative impact on EI (Oosterbeek et al., 2010; Rongzhi and Hu, 2011). (iii) no significant difference in the impact of whether students had received EE in the three aspects of innovation ability, risk-taking ability, and desire for success (Li and Huiming, 2010). Further, some also explored the moderating role of entrepreneurial competencies between use of e-commerce and SME performance (Hussain et al., 2022). In general, there has been much academic research over the years into the relationship among EI, EC, entrepreneurial ability, EE, and EB, but claims about specific positive or negative relationships have been controversial. As a new part of higher education, the present study reasons that the mode adopted by EE and the corresponding education quality satisfaction can have a positive or negative impact on college students\u2019 EC, and colleges and universities can continuously improve the learning mode of EE and enhance recognition of college EE, so as to improve the EC level of college students with EI and help them to effectively carry out EB and further to achieve entrepreneurial success, which means that EI is the internal factor of college students\u2019 EB, EE is the external factor of their EB, and the EC obtained from EE is an important driving factor to stimulate EI and practice EB. Therefore, the third purpose of this manuscript is to introduce recognition of college EE as a regulating variable to explore whether it plays a role in the impact of college students\u2019 EC\non their EI and EB under the current national entrepreneurial upsurge."

            "text": "Entrepreneurial cognition and entrepreneurial behavior\nThe Psychology Volume of Cihai (a well-known Chinese lexicon and character dictionary) defines \u201ccognition\u201d as the psychological process of individual cognition and understanding of things, i.e., the activities of human beings to recognize objective things and acquire knowledge: it is embodied in the process of processing and applying the acquired information, mainly including sensing, perception, attention, imagery, learning, memory, verbal problem solving, and decision-making, etc. The term \u201ccognition\u201d is used in many fields: in educational psychology, researchers often use it to express the information-processing view of individual mental activities of students, including processes such as perception, memory, learning, speech, thinking, and problem-solving; in behavioral psychology, researchers often use it to explain people\u2019s attitudes, behaviors, attributions, and group dynamics, etc. Meanwhile, in the Psychology Volume of Cihai, \u201cbehavior\u201d refers to the sum total of all reflections of the organism to the situation, including all internal and external, physiological and psychological reflections. Different branches of psychology study behavior from different angles: physiological psychology studies the physiological mechanism of organism behavior mainly from the perspective of hormones and nerves, while cognitive psychology studies it mainly from the perspective of information processing (Ning, 2017). In summary, combined with ternary interactive determinism, there is arguably a natural connection between cognition and behavior, i.e., some specific behavior of an individual is determined by the interaction of three factors, such as the external environment, individual cognition, and individual behavior. This ternary interaction makes the three factors not only act directly on individual behavior but also interact with each other and then further influence individual behavior.\nIn the theoretical and practical perspectives of pedagogy, the importance of cognition has never been overlooked. For example, in the ancient Chinese educational classic Xue Ji, the so-called \u201cseparation from the scriptures to distinguish one\u2019s aspirations\u201d and \u201cknowing the rest of a kind by analogy\u201d contains the original spirit of \u201ccognition.\u201d For Western intellectuals, the pursuit of rational spirit nurtured by the ancient Greek philosophers laid the foundation for the overall development of Western philosophy, culture, and education and thus naturally laid out the prototype of cognitive learning and teaching. And, the Learning and Teaching for Understanding\nFrontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org\n(LTFU) project launched by the Harvard Graduate School of Education in the 1990s promoted cognitive-oriented learning from teaching theory to the forefront of the world\u2019s educational research. Furthermore, according to dual cognitive processing theory, individual behavior is determined by the interaction between automated processing and controlled processing which will influence personal cognition, intention and behavior (Miles, 2021).\nEC originates from the development of traditional social cognition concepts by entrepreneurial scholars, which refers to the knowledge structure that individuals use to estimate, evaluate, and make decisions in the evaluation of opportunities and the creation and growth of enterprises (Mitchell et al., 2002a,b). Therefore, EC is a knowledge structure and thinking process, as well as a reflection of entrepreneurial ability, and the cognitive processing includes single and dual cognitive perspective. Many researchers have been pay more attention single procession of EC. Scholars both in and beyond China are yet to achieve consensus on the definition of EB, which is divided mainly into two different views: first, from a broad perspective, it is considered that the whole process of the establishment, survival, growth, and development of new enterprises belongs to EB; second, from a narrow perspective, EB refers only to the process from entrepreneurs\u2019 perception of entrepreneurial opportunities to the integration of entrepreneurial resources to the final establishment of the enterprise (Liu, 2018). In summary, based on the main objects of the present study, it can conclude that college students\u2019 EB refers to the dynamic behavior process in which they as individuals or groups make continuous efforts in team building, opportunity search, market evaluation, fund preparation, business decision-making, and other links to create new enterprises to provide innovative products or services based on their EC. This manuscript reason that EC can positively affect college students\u2019 EB in the following ways.\nFirst, EC is an important part of college students\u2019 EE. It is the knowledge structure used by college-student entrepreneurs to evaluate, judge, and make decisions in the process of opportunity evaluation and the growth of new start-ups (Mitchell et al., 2002a,b). Compared with individuals who lack entrepreneurial awareness, individuals with entrepreneurial awareness can give full play to their advantages after having relevant knowledge, and they will control the entrepreneurial situation from a long-term perspective, constantly surmounting obstacles and solving difficulties until they reach the goal, thus providing a motivation basis for actively implementing EB and actively dealing with uncertain factors in the entrepreneurial process (Ning, 2017).\nSecond, entrepreneurship is an innovative pioneering behavior, and it is a complex and challenging task to turn innovative ideas into entrepreneurial achievements. It requires entrepreneurs to have systematic, comprehensive, and in-depth knowledge reserves. Based on social cognition\ntheory, Bandura (1986) reasoned that EC directly affects the occurrence of individual thinking, motivation, and EB. Higher EC means more entrepreneurial knowledge and information reserves. When individuals have more and more reserves and channels to obtain knowledge and information, they can deepen their understanding of entrepreneurship itself and selfcognition; meanwhile, active EC can win more learning and practice opportunities for entrepreneurs, enrich the diversified knowledge of EC, make more entrepreneurial choices and decisions, and lay a knowledge and ability reserve for improving the success rate of entrepreneurship, so as to stimulate individual EB (Bird, 1988). Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis.\nH1: EC is positively associated with EB.\nIntermediary role of entrepreneurial intention\nAccording to the theory of planned behavior, the level of entrepreneurial consciousness and attitude of entrepreneurs determine their preparation before starting a business and whether they have EI. EC is the knowledge structure refers to the entrepreneur to fully understand and affirm the entrepreneurial idea and then put it into action. A high level of EI directs the attention and behavior of entrepreneurs to a specific goal and reinforces the idea. On the contrary, a low level of EC will cause potential entrepreneurs to feel confusion, anxiety, self-denial, and even fear in the face of the many uncertainties and unknown risks that can occur in entrepreneurship, and they may deny and give up entrepreneurship from an emotional perspective, thereby preventing or even terminating the formation of EI. Entrepreneurs who pursue a high level of EC often show individual characteristics of high sense of responsibility and strong affinity, as well as positive and extroverted and hard-working emotional tendencies. These characteristics and tendencies can better stimulate EI and enthusiasm (Chengxu, 2019). Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis.\nH2: EC is positively associated with EI.\nAccording to the planned-behavior theory of \u201ccognition\u2013 emotion\u2013intention\u2013behavior,\u201d from the perspective of psychology, EI is actually a subjective emotional attitude adopted by entrepreneurs in entrepreneurial activities. The emotional attitude of an entrepreneur is the premise for them to perform entrepreneurial activities. When an entrepreneur believes that the entrepreneurial opportunity and environment are mature, they will put the EB into action based on psychological factors such as cognition and emotion (Shi, 2016). For entrepreneurs, EI is the inner driving force for EB.\nFrontiers in Psychology 04 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 1 Theoretical framework of present study.\nEI can give strong spiritual support to new ventures and help entrepreneurs put their self-confidence into entrepreneurial activities and wish to realize its own value through actual entrepreneurial activities. When an entrepreneur chooses to start a business, their own conditions, resources, cognition of entrepreneurship, and risk identification ability all have an impact on the entrepreneur. When an entrepreneur starts their entrepreneurial activities, their own EI can provide them with rational entrepreneurial goals, so that they can choose and rationally use and expand their own resources in the entire process of entrepreneurial activities. The continuous changes in self-cognition and entrepreneurial environment will influence or guide EI, which will further be helpful for the achievement of entrepreneurial goals (Chengxu, 2019). Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis.\nH3: EI is positively associated with EB.\nAchievement goal theory provides a new theoretical perspective for exploring the relationship among EC, EB, and EI. On one hand, in the face of highly complex and uncertain entrepreneurial challenges, entrepreneurs with high-level EC can conduct serial processing via their existing knowledge and cognition level and combine certain logical reasoning to make a quick judgment on entrepreneurial opportunities and clarify the effective generation of EI, so as to form favorable entrepreneurial resources and conditions. Meanwhile, they can grasp effective information from limited or mostly useless information in the process of analyzing entrepreneurial opportunities, resources and challenges with their acquired entrepreneurial cognition. Therefore, they could get a much clearer new understanding of the entrepreneurial process, and then innovated points would be refined on the basis of \u201cre-cognition\u201d which would again constantly improve their own EI. And then the enhanced EI would also tends to promote EB (Wu and Ma, 2020). On the other hand, after learning the effective integration and rational\nuse of entrepreneurial resources, an entrepreneur is more likely to gain a sense of achievement and satisfaction, thereby further increasing their EI. This increased EI also promotes their advanced EB again (Fei-Fei, 2018).\nCombining the discussions of H1 and H2, we suggest that EI plays a mediating role between EC and EB, and we propose the following hypothesis.\nH4: EI mediates the relationship between EC and EB.\nMediating effect of recognition of university entrepreneurship education\nThe earliest appearance of EE can be traced back to the first course offered by Professor Myles Mace of Harvard Business School in 1947, and EE developed rapidly thereafter. And the concept of EE was first formally proposed by UNESCO at the International Symposium on Education for the 21st Century held in Beijing in November 1989: \u201cEntrepreneurship education, broadly defined as the development of pioneering individuals, is equally important to those who earn a salary, because employers or individuals are placing increasing emphasis on employer initiative, risk-taking, entrepreneurial and independent work ability, and technical, social, and managerial skills.\u201d In Ning (2017) further elaborated the complete concept of EE, i.e., it includes two aspects: job search and creation of new jobs. Since then, educational circles and experts both in and beyond China have paid great attention to and thought about EE, and it has also begun to be exploratively popularized and developed in colleges and universities both in and beyond China (Ning, 2017).\nBased on previous research, the core contents of EE can be defined as follows: (i) individual college student or teams of college students as the may object of education; (ii) colleges\nFrontiers in Psychology 05 frontiersin.org\nand universities as the main entity, government, society, industry, enterprise, family as the complemented entities (iii) including basic education, higher education and continuing education system (iii) deeply develop the educates has a series of knowledge, ability and character related to their employment and entrepreneurship; (iv) educating purpose is to help educates to plan their career freely, and further to help them to start their own business when certain preparation has been already done, which will not only provide new opportunities for themselves and others, but also make their own contributions to national economic growth and development (Ning, 2017). EE among college students has strong practical significance and theoretical guiding significance. It cannot only reposition the educational function but also deepen the nature and laws of education. EE is an effective way to train educated people to innovate in social economy, culture, and other fields and to meet the real needs of society and open up new development space. In recent years, driving employment through entrepreneurship has been the direct goal of promoting EE in China.\nMany studies based on planned-behavior theory have shown that EE and EI are closely related, i.e., EE can promote the improvement of individual EI. On one hand, EE can improve the entrepreneurial awareness of individual college students by imparting basic entrepreneurial knowledge, thereby deepening EC and stimulating EI; on the other hand, through practical education (e.g., writing entrepreneurship plan, participating in entrepreneurship competitions, joining in social practice, etc.), EE can improve the entrepreneurial practical skills and personal sense of achievement of college students or groups and further promote their re-cognition of starting a business process, and then once again clarify and strengthen their own EI (Xiu\u2019e and Kun, 2016). Based on the teach ability theory of EE, scholars both in and beyond China have affirmed the teach ability of entrepreneurship and pointed out that EE can improve individual EB. According to (Tan et al., 2015), the quality of and satisfaction with EE in colleges and universities will impact college students\u2019 EC, so as to encourage or to block them to effectively carry out EB and achieve entrepreneurial success. Therefore, we reason that recognition of college EE will moderate the relationship between EC and EI, and therefore we propose the following hypotheses.\nH5a: The recognition perception of college EE will strengthen the positive relationship between EC and EI.\nH5b: The recognition perception of college EE will strengthen the positive relationship between EC and EB.\nThe theoretical model of the present study is shown schematically in Figure 1."

The regression results in Table 5 show that EC and EI are correlated positively and significantly (M5, \u03b2 = 0.635, p < 0.01), as are EI and EB (M2, \u03b2 = 0.543, p < 0.001), so H2 and H3 are supported. Then EC and EI were put into the regression model at the same time, and EI and EB were still correlated positively and significantly (M3, \u03b2 = 0.543, p < 0.001), and the effect of EB was reduced from 0.635 to 0.333 (M2, \u03b2 = 0.333, p < 0.01). It can be seen that EI plays a partial intermediary role between EC and EB, so H4 is supported.\nFinally, the mediating effect of recognition of college EE on the relationship among EC, EI, and EB was tested. Before the regression analysis of mediating effect, the independent variables and mediating variables were centralized. Model 1 in Table 5 was adopted, which places the control variables in the first layer, places EC in the second layer, and takes EB as the result variable. The results of model 1 show that EB can be affected by EC positively and significantly, and so H1 is further supported. Then, to put model 5 into the first layer as the control variable, to put EC in the second layer, and to put EC,\nrecognition perception of EE in colleges and universities, and mediating effect items to the third layer, the results show that the interaction between EC and EE recognition perception is not significant (M5, \u03b2 = 0.067, p < 0.05), which indicating that the recognition of college EE does not play a regulating role in the relationship between EC and EI; therefore, H5a is not supported. This result is inconsistent with our theoretical expectation, i.e., the recognition perception of EE may not necessarily strengthen the positive relationship between EC and EI. The empirical study based on the theory of planned behavior shows that EE can indeed improve EC and enhance EI by teaching basic entrepreneurial knowledge and carrying out practical education. However, students\u2019 EI is determined by not only EE. Regardless of a person\u2019s recognition and perception of EE, their inherent attitude, subjective norms, beliefs, and behavior control before receiving EE can affect their EI most significantly. Also, empirical research based on the entrepreneurial event model shows that because of the relatively weak predictive ability of the antecedent variables related to EI\u2014such as subjective norms, desirability, and feasibility perception\u2014and the difficulty of making accurate measurements in practice, even though EE courses have a positive effect on a person\u2019s perception of feasibility, the effect on their perception of desirability is not significant, i.e., EE may have a significant effect on individual entrepreneurial self-efficacy, but its relationship with EI is still weak (Xiu\u2019e and Kun, 2016). Therefore, in a complex reality, individuals\u2019 recognition perception of EE does not always reach an appropriate level and will be affected by the perception of feasibility and desirability. The specific differences of EE on EC and EI also need to be explored further.\nAccording to the above methods, the mediating effect of the recognition of college EE on the relationship between EC and EB was tested. Model 1 in Table 5 was adopted, which places the control variables in the first layer, places EC in the second layer, and takes EB as the result variable. The results of model 1 show that EB can be positively predicted by EC, and so H1 is further supported. Finally, model 2 puts the control variables in the first layer, EC in the second layer, and EC, recognition of college EE, and mediating effect items in the third layer. The results show that the interaction between them also has a significant impact on EB (M4, \u03b2 = 0.312, p < 0.05). Therefore, it can be concluded that the recognition of university EE plays a positive mediating role in the relationship between EC and\nFrontiers in Psychology 08 frontiersin.org\nEB. Therefore, H5b is supported, i.e., the higher the degree of college students\u2019 perception of the recognition of EE in colleges and universities, the stronger the positive relationship between their EC and EB."

(1) EC can significantly and positively influence the EB of college students. (2) EC can significantly and positively influence the EI of college students. (3) There is a significant positive correlation between the EI of college students and their EB. (4) The EI of college students partially mediates the positive correlation between their EC and EB, i.e., college students\u2019 EC affects their EB by affecting their EI. (5) The relationship between the recognition of college EE and EC and EI did not exert a significant positive moderating effect, but it played a significant positive moderating effect on the relationship between EI and EB, i.e., high-quality EE can stimulate further EB of college students. Therefore, the focus of college EE reform should be on how to reform and innovate entrepreneurship cognitive education to stimulate its positive impact on the EI and EB of the existing college students."

Based on the\nbehavioral logic of individual \u201ccognition\u2013emotion\u2013intention\u2013 behavior,\u201d this study focuses on the relationship between EC and EB and responds to the previous research conclusions of scholars such as Fayolle, Peterman, Kennedy, and Zhang: EE may have little effect on the entrepreneurial enthusiasm of college students, and in individual cases it may have no effect or even a negative impact on EI and its antecedent variables.\nSecond, in combination with the new trend of mass entrepreneurship and innovation in China in recent years, this manuscript conducted research from the perspective of the specific content and mode of EE reform in colleges and universities, integrated the recognition of college EE into the research framework of college students\u2019 EC and EB, and supplemented and integrated the previous theories based on planned-behavior theory, dual cognitive processing theory, selfefficacy theory, or the entrepreneurial event model, i.e., by revealing the boundary conditions of the role of EC, it expands the research perspective of college students\u2019 EB. Previous theoretical and empirical studies have shown that if a college or university provides EC and practical support, then the possibility of college students choosing entrepreneurship will increase greatly. However, these studies ignore the audience of EE: college students\u2019 own individual characteristics, their perception of entrepreneurial feasibility, their perception of acceptability, and their perception of recognition of the existing EE. Our research results show that in the current era of mass entrepreneurship and innovation, college students\u2019 EB is affected comprehensively by self-EC, individual EI, and recognition perception of EE in colleges and universities. It is shown that the recognition perception of EE in colleges and universities is an important boundary condition for college students\u2019 EC to have a positive effect on their EB.\nThird, as a pre-factor of individual behavior, EI mediates the relationship between college students\u2019 EC and their EB. On one hand, EC can significantly promote college students\u2019 EI and stimulate self-efficacy, and the strengthening of EI further promotes college students\u2019 EB. On the other hand, note that the EI of college students is not entirely determined by the EE in colleges and universities.

            "text": "In EE in colleges and universities, there is a natural connection among EC, EI, and EB, and the continuous accumulation of entrepreneurial knowledge and experience can gradually be transformed into entrepreneurial practice ability. However, EI is endogenous and exogenous, including the impact of cognition of independence, challenges, achievements, rights, wealth, interests, habits, efficacy, family, education, and social recognition on the individual differentiation. At the same time, the factors that affect EC are also complex. EE in colleges and universities is only one factor that affects EC, and there may be other factors, so the recognition perception of EE in colleges and universities may not strengthen the positive relationship between EC and EI. However, the highly recognized EE perception in colleges and universities can significantly promote college students\u2019 EB. Therefore, EE in colleges and universities can directly affect the EB of college students by constructing a scientific and operable EE model. Therefore, the focus of\nsubsequent research will be on how to reform and innovate the existing college EE model to stimulate the positive impact of college students\u2019 EC on their EI and EB. Furthermore, the main body of entrepreneurship education is not only universities and colleges, families, entrepreneurial enterprises, government, entrepreneur and other entrepreneurial stakeholders should be involved in, and then to play, respectively, effect to help students processing EC positively."

This study only verified its impact on EI and EB from the two dimensions of entrepreneurial-readiness cognition and entrepreneurial-ability cognition, which is not comprehensive enough.
