    "abstractText": "In this work, we obtain the leading subeikonal corrections to the jet momentum broadening distribution in a QCD medium arising from the transverse flow of the matter. We first derive the single-particle propagator of a highly energetic parton resumming its multiple interactions with the homogeneous flowing matter, explicitly keeping the leading subeikonal flow terms. Then, we use this propagator to obtain the jet broadening distribution and its leading moments. We show that this distribution becomes anisotropic in the presence of transverse flow, since its odd moments are generally nonzero and proportional to the transverse velocity of the medium. Finally, we evaluate several odd moments, which we compare to the corresponding results at first order in opacity, showing that accounting for multiple in-medium scatterings is essential to describe some observables in dense nuclear matter.",

INTRODUCTION\nOne of the most important signatures of the formation of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in high-energy nuclear collisions is the suppression of highly energetic particles, a phenomenon commonly known as jet quenching [1,2]. Although the suppression of such high-energy particles has been largely explained in terms of the energy loss due to their interactions with the QGP, recent developments both from theory and experiment have shown that the inner structure of the jets created by these particles is also significantly modified. Due to the sensitivity to all these effects, jets in heavy-ion collisions provide a unique tool to study the properties and structure of the QGP. This concept of jet tomography has attracted a great deal of attention in the literature, see for instance [3\u201318] and references therein. The interaction of high-energy colored particles with the QGP is usually described within perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) as a scattering process where the medium is modeled with a background stochastic color field, see e.g., [19\u201333]. In this picture, highly energetic partons undergo multiple scatterings with the\nQCD matter, resulting in both the broadening of their transverse1 momentum distribution and the emission of real radiation, also referred to as medium-induced radiation. While this approach is rather general, several approximations are made in order to simplify the calculations while capturing the main physical effects, see e.g., [31,34,35]. In this paper, we will focus on the high-energy approximation, known also as eikonal approximation, where all transverse momenta are considered smaller than the energy of the final parton E. This assumption implies that the broadening and radiation dynamics decouple from the transverse structure and evolution of the medium, as explained in [12]. At this point, it is important to make a clarification about the use of this high-energy approximation in different settings and what is usually understood by the eikonal limit. On its most strict form, the eikonal limit refers to the case where all contributions of order O\u00f0\u22a5=E\u00de, where \u22a5 stands for any of the relevant transverse scales, are neglected. This is the eikonal limit used for instance in color glass condensate (CGC) calculations, where the transverse positions of incoming partons are frozen during the interaction with the target and its wave function is only modified through a color rotation. For calculations involving in-medium emissions this approximation is too restrictive and nontrivial results are achieved only when terms scaling as \u22a52E z are kept to all orders, with z a longitudinal position taking values up to the length of the medium, see *carlota.andres-casas@polytechnique.edu \u2020fabio.dominguez@usc.es \u2021andrey.sadofyev@usc.es \u00a7carlos.salgado@usc.es\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

These terms include phases arising from vacuum propagators in between scatterings, usually referred to as Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) phases, which are essential to get the correct emission spectrum and yield to the well-known LPM suppression in the multiple scattering calculations. This is the case that will be used as the zeroth order for the calculations in this paper, and therefore we will refer to it as the eikonal limit, in contrast to the subeikonal contributions which scale as\u22a5=E with no explicit length enhancement. Since jets decouple from the transverse structure and dynamics of the QCD matter in the eikonal limit, these medium effects can only be included into jet-quenching formalisms by relaxing the eikonal approximation. Due to the difficulties inherent to such beyond-eikonal calculations, several works attempted to account for transverse flow effects focusing on the medium dilution effects [37\u2013 39], using phenomenological motivated models [39\u201341], or considering purely kinematic arguments [42\u201344]. It was not until very recently that matter transverse structure and flow were rigorously included in a pQCD description of in-medium radiation and broadening [12], where the flow effects were shown to enter at subeikonal order. This calculation was performed at leading order in the Gyulassy-Levai-Vitev opacity expansion framework [23\u201325], where only one scattering with the medium is allowed. Extending this result to account for all multiple in-medium scatterings by means of the Baier, Dokshitzer, Mueller, Peigne\u0301, Schiff, and Zakharov (BDMPS-Z) framework [19\u201322] is then the next natural step in the development of this theory. This program was already started in [16] where the transverse gradients of matter properties were taken into account for the calculation of the broadening distribution. In this work, we focus on the subeikonal corrections to the broadening distribution due to the transverse flow of the QGP. We first compute the in-medium propagator of a highly energetic parton resumming its multiple interactions with homogeneous flowing matter. Then, we use that result to derive the leading subeikonal corrections to the momentum broadening due to the transverse velocity of the medium, generalizing the result of [12] to all orders in opacity. We show that the all-order broadening distribution, isotropic in the static case, becomes anisotropic due to these transverse flow terms. While we focus here on the case of\nthe QGP, similar effects could also arise in cold nuclear matter due to the collective motion of the nucleons. The paper is organized as follows: in Sec. IIwe present the derivation of the amplitude of a high-energy parton moving throughout flowing homogeneous matter in the BDMPS-Z formalism. We obtain in Sec. III the broadening distribution by computing the average over the scattering centers of the squared amplitude. In Sec. IVwe compute the oddmoments of the final state momentum distribution, which in contrast with the static case do not vanish, thus probing that jet broadening is anisotropic in the presence of transverse flow. Finally, we summarize and conclude in Sec. V."

The corresponding matrix element can be written as\niMn\u00f0p\u00de \u00bc Z Yn\u22121\nj\u00bc0\nd4pj \u00f02\u03c0\u00de4 igA\u03bc\u00f0pj\u00fe1 \u2212 pj\u00de\n\u00d7 \u00f0pj\u00fe1 \u00fe pj\u00de\u03bc i\np2j \u00fe i\u03f5 J\u00f0p0\u00de; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere pn \u2261 p is the final four-momentum of the parton, A\u03bc\u00f0q\u00de \u00bc Aa\u03bc\u00f0q\u00deta is the background field, the index \u03bc runs over 4D space-time, ta is the color matrix in the representation of the projectile (the highly energetic parton), and the product is ordered from right to left with the nth field insertion being the leftmost factor.\n074023-2\nNow, following [12], the medium velocity can be included in the calculation by modifying the background field entering Eq. (1). In order to do so, we model the matter as a collection of massive color sources moving with nonrelativistic velocity2 u\u03bc \u00bc \u00f01; u; uz\u00de, as explained in detail in Sec. II C of [12]. We introduce here a subtle modification with respect to [12]: we make use of the color charge density \u03c1\u0302a\u00f0x; z\u00de in coordinate space, allowing us to have a continuous distribution of medium sources (which will be averaged over after squaring the amplitude), as is the common practice both in the CGC and BDMPS-Z formalisms. We also set the longitudinal velocity equal to zero uz \u00bc 0, since its effects can be obtained by performing a longitudinal boost. We focus, instead, on calculating the subeikonal corrections arising from the transverse velocity u, which cannot be recovered by a transverse boost, since transverse boosts do not commute with the eikonal expansion. Hence, the background field used in our calculation has the following form:\ngAa\u03bb\u00f0q\u00de \u00bc u\u03bbv\u00f0q\u00de Z d2xdze\u2212i\u00f0q\u00b7x\u00feqzz\u00de\u03c1\u0302a\u00f0x; z\u00de\n\u00d7 \u00f02\u03c0\u00de\u03b4\u00f0q0 \u2212 u \u00b7 q\u00de; \u00f02\u00de where v is the interaction potential, and we have neglected the recoil of the sources. We rely on the Gyulassy-Wang (GW) model [45], and thus set v to\nv\u00f0q\u00de \u00bc g 2\nq2 \u2212 \u03bc2 \u00fe i\u03f5 ; \u00f03\u00de\nwhere \u03bc is the Debye mass of the QGP or another characteristic screening scale (e.g., in the case of cold nuclear matter).\nNote that the field of a discrete collection of scattering centers used in [12] can be straightforwardly obtained from Eq. (2) by taking \u03c1\u0302a\u00f0x; z\u00de \u00bc Pj taj\u03b4\u00f02\u00de\u00f0x \u2212 xj\u00de\u03b4\u00f0z \u2212 zj\u00de, where taj is the color generator of jth source. Plugging (2) into (1) we can easily perform the integrals over the zero components of all the momenta. Then, we perform all the integrals over the z components using contour integration, where only one type of poles of the intermediate propagators of the fast moving parton contributes to the desired accuracy, as explained for instance in [12,34]. Indeed, since we are considering only highly energetic partons, a single interaction is not able to change the sign of the large component of the projectile momentum, thus fixing the sign of pjz for all j up to higher subeikonal orders. Notice also that the potentials v\u00f0q\u00de are screened and the corresponding poles are suppressed under the assumption that the sources are sufficiently separated. Then, the zero and longitudinal components of the intermediate momenta are set to\npj0 \u2243 u \u00b7 p\u00fe u \u00b7 pj; \u00f04a\u00de\npjz \u2243 pj0 \u2212 p2j\u22a5 2E \u00bc u \u00b7 p\u00fe u \u00b7 pj \u2212 p2j\u22a5 2E ; \u00f04b\u00de\nwhere u \u00b7 p\u2261 u\u03bcp\u03bc \u2243 E \u2212 u \u00b7 p, p0 \u2261 E is the parton final energy, pj\u22a5 \u2261 jpjj is the magnitude of the 2D vector pj, and we have kept just the zeroth and first-order terms in the eikonal expansion. Now, upon reshuffling some of the Fourier factors, the amplitude reduces to\niMn\u00f0p\u00de \u00bc Z Yn\u22121\nj\u00bc0\ndzj\u00fe1 d2pj \u00f02\u03c0\u00de2 i 1 \u2212 u \u00b7 pj E v\u00f0p\u0303j\u00fe1 \u2212 p\u0303j\u00de\u03c1\u0302aj\u00fe1\u00f0pj\u00fe1 \u2212 pi; zj\u00fe1\u00detaj\u00fe1\u03b8\u00f0zj\u00fe1 \u2212 zj\u00dee i u\u00b7pj\u2212\np2 j\u22a5 2E \u00f0zj\u00fe1\u2212zj\u00de\n\u00d7 e \u2212i u\u00b7p\u2212\np2\u22a5 2E\nzn J\u00f0p\u03030\u00de; \u00f05\u00de\nwhere we have defined p\u0303j as the four-momentum of the leading parton with its zero and longitudinal components replaced according to Eq.

Here we have also used the mixed representation of the color charge operator where only the transverse\ncomponents are Fourier transformed while the longitudinal coordinate is explicitly kept,\n\u03c1\u0302a\u00f0q; z\u00de \u00bc Z d2xe\u2212iq\u00b7x\u03c1\u0302a\u00f0x; z\u00de: \u00f06\u00de\nNotice that the LPM phases in (5) are affected by the flow velocity, as shown in [12]. At this point, we can write the amplitude as a convolution of the initial source J with an in-medium propagator G\u00f0p; L; p0; z0\u00de in the following way:\niMn\u00f0p\u00de\u00bc e \u2212i u\u00b7p\u2212\np2\u22a5 2E L Z\nd2p0 \u00f02\u03c0\u00de2Gn\u00f0p;L;p0;0\u00deJ\u00f0p\u03030\u00de; \u00f07\u00de 2Throughout this manuscript bold font will be used for 2D vectors in the transverse plane with respect to the leading parton large momentum component pz.\n074023-3\nwhere the nth-order perturbative contribution to the propagator is given by\nGn\u00f0p; L; p0; z0\u00de \u00bc Yn j\u00bc1\nZ L\nz0\ndzj Z d2pj \u00f02\u03c0\u00de2 i 1 \u2212 u \u00b7 pj\u22121 E v\u00f0p\u0303j \u2212 p\u0303j\u22121\u00de\u03c1\u0302aj\u00f0pj \u2212 pj\u22121; zj\u00detaj\n\u00d7 \u03b8\u00f0zj \u2212 zj\u22121\u00dee i u\u00b7pj\u22121\u2212\np2 j\u22121\u22a5 2E \u00f0zj\u2212zj\u22121\u00de\n\u00f02\u03c0\u00de2\u03b4\u00f02\u00de\u00f0p \u2212 pn\u00dee\ni u\u00b7p\u2212 p2\u22a5 2E \u00f0L\u2212zn\u00de\n: \u00f08\u00de\nBefore turning to the resummation procedure, it is useful to cast (8) as a recursion relation in the following way:\nGn\u00f0p; L; p0; z0\u00de \u00bc i Z L\nz0\ndz Z\nd2l \u00f02\u03c0\u00de2 1 \u2212 u \u00b7 l E v\u00f0p\u0303 \u2212 l\u0303\u00de\u03c1\u0302a\u00f0p \u2212 l; z\u00detaei u\u00b7p\u2212\np2\u22a5 2E \u00f0L\u2212z\u00de\nGn\u22121\u00f0l; z; p0; z0\u00de; \u00f09\u00de\nwhere l\u0303 \u00bc \u00f0u \u00b7 p\u00fe u \u00b7 l; l; u \u00b7 p\u00fe u \u00b7 l \u2212 l2\u22a5 2E\u00de. Now Eq. (9) can be straightforwardly summed over n from zero to infinity, leading to an integral equation for the full propagator\nG\u00f0p; L; p0; z0\u00de \u00bc G0\u00f0p; L; p0; z0\u00de \u00fe i Z L\nz0\ndz Z\nd2l \u00f02\u03c0\u00de2 1 \u2212 u \u00b7 l E v\u00f0p\u0303 \u2212 l\u0303\u00de\u03c1\u0302a\u00f0p \u2212 l; z\u00detaei u\u00b7p\u2212\np2\u22a5 2E \u00f0L\u2212z\u00de\nG\u00f0l; z; p0; z0\u00de; \u00f010\u00de\nwhere, by focusing on the case of no interactions, one can see that the correct initial propagator G0\u00f0p; L; p0; z0\u00de is given by\nG0\u00f0p; L; p0; z0\u00de \u00bc \u00f02\u03c0\u00de2\u03b4\u00f02\u00de\u00f0p \u2212 p0\u00dee i u\u00b7p\u2212\np2\u22a5 2E \u00f0L\u2212z0\u00de\n: \u00f011\u00de\nThe integral equation above can also be rewritten as a differential equation in L, which reads\n\u2202\n\u2202L G\u00f0p; L; p0; z0\u00de \u00bc i u \u00b7 p \u2212 p2\u22a5 2E G\u00f0p; L; p0; z0\u00de\n\u00fe i Z\nd2l \u00f02\u03c0\u00de2 1 \u2212 u \u00b7 l E v\u00f0p\u0303 \u2212 l\u0303\u00de\n\u00d7 \u03c1\u0302a\u00f0p \u2212 l; L\u00detaG\u00f0l; L; p0; z0\u00de: \u00f012\u00de\nIt is clear that in the limit of zero transverse flow velocity this equation reduces to its standard form, see for instance [46]. Besides the explicit terms with a factor of u, the propagator in (12) also contains an implicit velocity correction arising from the momentum dependence of the potential v. For the GW model v\u00f0q\u00de depends only on q2 and the particular combination of momenta \u00f0p\u0303 \u2212 l\u0303\u00de2 expanded up to the first subeikonal order reads\n\u00f0p\u0303 \u2212 l\u0303\u00de2 \u2248 \u2212\u00f0p \u2212 l\u00de2 \u00fe u \u00b7 \u00f0p \u2212 l\u00dep 2\u22a5 \u2212 l2\u22a5 E : \u00f013\u00de\nWithout the velocity correction, the 0 component of \u00f0p\u0303 \u2212 l\u0303\u00de\u03bc is zero, while the z component of the exchanged momentum can be ignored at leading subeikonal order\ngiven that it scales as \u22a52=E2. However, with a nonzero velocity the correction at order \u22a5=E shown in (13) arises, which must be kept since it is of the same order as the other velocity corrections considered up to now. Including only subeikonal contributions at first order, we can write the differential equation satisfied by the in-medium propagator as\n\u2202\n\u2202L G\u00f0p; L; p0; z0\u00de \u00bc i u \u00b7 p \u2212 p2\u22a5 2E G\u00f0p; L; p0; z0\u00de\n\u00fe i Z\nd2q \u00f02\u03c0\u00de2 \u00bd1\u00fe u \u00b7\u03a9\u00f0p; q\u00de v\u00f0q 2\u22a5\u00de\n\u00d7 \u03c1\u0302a\u00f0q; L\u00detaG\u00f0p \u2212 q; L; p0; z0\u00de; \u00f014\u00de\nwhere we have introduced a shorthand notation for the leading subeikonal factors appearing outside of the LPM phases\n\u03a9\u00f0p; q\u00de \u00bc \u2212 p \u2212 q E \u00fe q E \u00f0p \u2212 q\u00de2 \u2212 p2 v\u00f0q2\u22a5\u00de \u2202v \u2202q2\u22a5 : \u00f015\u00de\nAt this point, all the velocity contributions are explicit. These new terms considerably complicate the differential equation, since now the second term in (14) is not a convolution between the interaction potential and the propagator as in the absence of flow.Working in the eikonal expansion, it is convenient to write the solution of (14) as\nG\u00f0p; L; p0; z0\u00de \u00bc G\u00f00\u00de\u00f0p; L; p0; z0\u00de \u00fe G\u00f01\u00de\u00f0p; L; p0; z0\u00de\n\u00feO \u22a52 E2 : \u00f016\u00de\n074023-4\nKeeping the terms resulting in the LPM phases to all orders, we find that the two contributions G\u00f00\u00de and G\u00f01\u00de satisfy\n\u2202 \u2202L G\u00f00\u00de\u00f0p; L; p0; z0\u00de \u00bc i u \u00b7 p \u2212 p2\u22a5 2E G\u00f00\u00de\u00f0p; L; p0; z0\u00de \u00fe i Z d2q \u00f02\u03c0\u00de2 v\u00f0q 2\u22a5\u00de\u03c1\u0302a\u00f0q; L\u00detaG\u00f00\u00de\u00f0p \u2212 q; L; p0; z0\u00de; \u00f017a\u00de\n\u2202 \u2202L G\u00f01\u00de\u00f0p; L; p0; z0\u00de \u00bc i u \u00b7 p \u2212 p2\u22a5 2E G\u00f01\u00de\u00f0p; L; p0; z0\u00de \u00fe i Z d2q \u00f02\u03c0\u00de2 v\u00f0q 2\u22a5\u00de\u03c1\u0302a\u00f0q; L\u00detaG\u00f01\u00de\u00f0p \u2212 q; L; p0; z0\u00de;\n\u00fe i Z\nd2q \u00f02\u03c0\u00de2 u \u00b7\u03a9\u00f0p; q\u00dev\u00f0q 2\u22a5\u00de\u03c1\u0302a\u00f0q; L\u00detaG\u00f00\u00de\u00f0p \u2212 q; L; p0; z0\u00de; \u00f017b\u00de\nwith initial conditions\nG\u00f00\u00de\u00f0p; z0; p0; z0\u00de \u00bc \u00f02\u03c0\u00de2\u03b4\u00f02\u00de\u00f0p \u2212 p0\u00de; \u00f018\u00de\nG\u00f01\u00de\u00f0p; z0; p0; z0\u00de \u00bc 0: \u00f019\u00de\nLet us first look at (17a). In the case of static matter this equation has been widely studied, and its solution can be written in terms of a path integral in coordinate space [34]. The additional velocity term in this equation introduces only a time-dependent shift in the transverse coordinates of the propagator G\u00f00\u00de\u00f0p; L; p0; z0\u00de. In order to see this, we first write (17a) as\n\u2202 \u2202L \u00bde\u2212iu\u00b7p\u00f0L\u2212z0\u00deG\u00f00\u00de\u00f0p; L; p0; z0\u00de \u00bc \u2212i p2\u22a5 2E\ne\u2212iu\u00b7p\u00f0L\u2212z0\u00deG\u00f00\u00de\u00f0p; L; p0; z0\u00de \u00fe i Z\nd2q \u00f02\u03c0\u00de2 e \u2212iu\u00b7q\u00f0L\u2212z0\u00dev\u00f0q2\u22a5\u00de\u03c1\u0302a\u00f0q; L\u00detae\u2212iu\u00b7\u00f0p\u2212q\u00de\u00f0L\u2212z0\u00de\n\u00d7 G\u00f00\u00de\u00f0p \u2212 q; L; p0; z0\u00de; \u00f020\u00de\nand notice that the rescaled function satisfies the same boundary conditions.

For simplicity, we take a Gaussian distribution for the scatterings in which the only nontrivial correlation is the two-point function\nh\u03c1\u0302a\u00f0x;zx\u00de\u03c1\u0302b\u00f0y;zy\u00dei\u00bc 1 2CR\u0304 \u03b4ab\u03b4\u00f02\u00de\u00f0x\u2212y\u00de\u03b4\u00f0zx\u2212 zy\u00de\u03c1\u00f0x;zx\u00de;\n\u00f026\u00de\nwhere we have defined CR\u0304 as CR\u0304 \u00bc Nc for quarks and CR\u0304 \u00bc CF for gluons. We have also introduced the number density of scattering centers \u03c1\u00f0x; z\u00de. This averaging procedure coincides with the usual GW model used in [12,16] as well as the McLerran-Venugopalan model in the CGC context. Taking the transverse Fourier transform of (26) we get\nh\u03c1\u0302a\u00f0q;z\u00de\u03c1\u0302b\u00f0q0;z0\u00dei\u00bc 1 2CR\u0304\n\u03b4ab\u03b4\u00f0z\u2212z0\u00de Z d2xe\u2212i\u00f0q\u00feq0\u00de\u00b7x\u03c1\u00f0x;z\u00de:\n\u00f027\u00de\nFrom now on, we will focus on the case of transversely homogeneous matter, setting \u03c1 to be a function of z only. The leading effects of medium transverse anisotropies on jet-medium interactions, manifested through gradients of the thermodynamic parameters, were already discussed in [12,16]. In fact, in the absence of transverse flow, the gradient contributions to jet broadening are also subeikonal (although enhanced by the medium length), and can be clearly separated from the flow effects up to first subeikonal order. Cross terms involving both gradients and transverse velocity have not yet been addressed in the literature, and we leave them for future work. It is worth noticing, however, that the leading cross contributions affect only the even moments of the final distribution. For transversely homogeneous matter \u03c1\u00f0x; z\u00de \u00bc \u03c1\u00f0z\u00de, and we can perform the Fourier transformation in (27) getting\nh\u03c1\u0302a\u00f0q; z\u00de\u03c1\u0302b\u00f0q0; z0\u00dei \u00bc 1 2CR\u0304 \u03b4ab\u03b4\u00f0z \u2212 z0\u00de\u03b4\u00f02\u00de\u00f0q\u00fe q0\u00de\u03c1\u00f0z\u00de:\n\u00f028\u00de\nNote that since \u03c1\u0302a is real in coordinate space, \u03c1\u0302a\u2020\u00f0q\u22a5; z\u00de \u00bc \u03c1\u0302a\u00f0\u2212q\u22a5; z\u00de. The source terms J and J\u2020 can be pulled out of the medium averages, allowing us to focus on the combination of two propagators appearing in (25). Moreover, the trivial color structure of the averaging procedure (26) implies\nhG\u2020\u00f0p00; 0; p; L\u00deG\u00f0p; L; p0; 0\u00dei\n\u00bc 1 dproj hTr\u00bdG\u2020\u00f0p00; 0; p; L\u00deG\u00f0p; L; p0; 0\u00de i; \u00f029\u00de\nwhere dproj is the dimension of the representation corresponding to the projectile. One could in principle calculate this average of two propagators directly using their explicit expressions (23) and (24), but that would entail summing all the contributions from all possible pairings of the explicit factor of \u03c1\u0302 appearing in (24) with other \u03c1\u0302\u2019s hidden in the factors of G\u00f00\u00de. Instead, here we derive a differential equation in L satisfied by this product of propagators, similarly to [47]. We start by considering an infinitesimal step in L and using the convolution properties of the propagators we have\n1\ndproj hTr\u00bdG\u2020\u00f0p00; 0; p; L\u00fe \u03f5\u00deG\u00f0p; L\u00fe \u03f5; p0; 0\u00de i\n\u00bc Z l;l0 1 dproj hTr\u00bdG\u2020\u00f0p00; 0; l0; L\u00deG\u2020\u00f0l0; L; p; L\u00fe \u03f5\u00de\n\u00d7 G\u00f0p; L\u00fe \u03f5; l; L\u00deG\u00f0l; L; p0; 0\u00de i: \u00f030\u00de\nFrom (28) it is clear that the averages are local in the longitudinal coordinate, meaning that only pairs of \u03c1\u0302\u2019s at the same longitudinal coordinate give a nonzero contribution to the average. This allows us to factorize the average in (30) as the product of averages of propagators having a common support in the longitudinal direction. Combining this fact with the color triviality, as seen for instance in (29), we can rewrite the trace in the right-hand side of (30) as\n1\ndproj hTr\u00bdG\u2020\u00f0p00; 0; p; L\u00fe \u03f5\u00deG\u00f0p; L\u00fe \u03f5; p0; 0\u00de i\n\u00bc Z l;l0 1 dproj hTr\u00bdG\u2020\u00f0l0; L; p; L\u00fe \u03f5\u00deG\u00f0p; L\u00fe \u03f5; l; L\u00de i\n\u00d7 1 dproj hTr\u00bdG\u2020\u00f0p00; 0; l0; L\u00deG\u00f0l; L; p0; 0\u00de i: \u00f031\u00de\nIn order to find the terms linear in \u03f5, one has to expand the propagators going from L to L\u00fe \u03f5 using iteratively the integral relation (10). At the required accuracy we have\n074023-6\nG\u00f0p; L\u00fe \u03f5; l; L\u00de \u2243 \u00f02\u03c0\u00de2\u03b4\u00f02\u00de\u00f0p \u2212 l\u00deei u\u00b7p\u2212\np2\u22a5 2E\n\u03f5 \u00fe i\nZ L\u00fe\u03f5\nL dz Z d2q \u00f02\u03c0\u00de2 \u00f01\u00fe u \u00b7\u03a9\u00f0p; q\u00de\u00dev\u00f0q 2\u22a5\u00de\u03c1\u0302a\u00f0q; z\u00detae i u\u00b7p\u2212 p2\u22a5 2E \u00f0L\u00fe\u03f5\u2212z\u00de\n\u00d7 e i u\u00b7l\u2212\nl2\u22a5 2E\n\u00f0z\u2212L\u00de\u00f02\u03c0\u00de2\u03b4\u00f02\u00de\u00f0p \u2212 q \u2212 l\u00de\n\u2212 Z L\u00fe\u03f5\nL dz2\nZ z2\nL dz1 Z d2q2 \u00f02\u03c0\u00de2 d2q1 \u00f02\u03c0\u00de2 \u00f01\u00fe u \u00b7\u03a9\u00f0p; q2\u00de\u00de\u00f01\u00fe u \u00b7\u03a9\u00f0p \u2212 q2; q1\u00de\u00de\n\u00d7 v\u00f0q22\u22a5\u00dev\u00f0q21\u22a5\u00de\u03c1\u0302a2\u00f0q2; z2\u00deta2 \u03c1\u0302a1\u00f0q1; z1\u00deta1e i u\u00b7p\u2212\np2\u22a5 2E \u00f0L\u00fe\u03f5\u2212z2\u00de\ne i\nu\u00b7\u00f0p\u2212q2\u00de\u2212\u00f0p\u2212q2\u00de 2\n2E\n\u00f0z2\u2212z1\u00de\n\u00d7 e i u\u00b7l\u2212\nl2\u22a5 2E\n\u00f0z1\u2212L\u00de\u00f02\u03c0\u00de2\u03b4\u00f02\u00de\u00f0p \u2212 q2 \u2212 q1 \u2212 l\u00de; \u00f032\u00de\nwith G\u2020\u00f0l0; L; p; L\u00fe \u03f5\u00de following from it. When we take the average of the trace of two propagators, the linear terms in \u03c1\u0302 cancel out, while the terms with exactly two factors of \u03c1\u0302 yield to the linear contribution in \u03f5. The latter come either from the product of a term with no \u03c1\u0302\u2019s in one of the propagators times a term with two \u03c1\u0302\u2019s in the other one, the so-called double Born contributions, or\nfrom the product of two terms with one \u03c1\u0302 each, referred to as single Born contributions. Let us first consider the double Born contributions, involving the last term in (32) (or its conjugate). According to (28), we have an additional \u03b4 function setting q1 \u00bc \u2212q2, which also ensures that all the phases cancel out. The corresponding contribution takes the form\n\u2212C Z L\u00fe\u03f5\nL dz2\nZ z2\nL dz1 Z d2q \u00f02\u03c0\u00de2 \u00f01\u00feu \u00b7\u03a9\u00f0p;q\u00de\u00de\u00f01\u00feu \u00b7\u03a9\u00f0p\u2212q;\u2212q\u00de\u00dev 2\u00f0q2\u22a5\u00de\u03b4\u00f0z2\u2212z1\u00de\u03c1\u00f0z1\u00de\u00f02\u03c0\u00de2\u03b4\u00f02\u00de\u00f0p\u2212 l\u00de\u00f02\u03c0\u00de2\u03b4\u00f02\u00de\u00f0p\u2212 l0\u00de;\n\u00f033\u00de\nwhere we have combined the color structure coming from the projectile generators with the color factor in (28), introducing C \u00bc Cproj 2CR\u0304\n, where Cproj is the Casimir of the projectile representation. One may notice that the double z integration in (33) is not fully defined, since it involves a delta function on the edge of the domain. However, due to the locality of the medium average (28), the result has to be symmetric under the exchange of z2 and z1 in (33), and thus this particular \u03b4 function is symmetric, yieldingZ\nL\u00fe\u03f5\nL dz2\nZ z2\nL dz1\u03b4\u00f0z2 \u2212 z1\u00de\u03c1\u00f0z1\u00de \u2243\n\u03f5 2 \u03c1\u00f0L\u00de: \u00f034\u00de\nKeeping only the leading subeikonal corrections, we can write\n\u00f01\u00fe u \u00b7\u03a9\u00f0p; q\u00de\u00de\u00f01\u00fe u \u00b7\u03a9\u00f0p \u2212 q;\u2212q\u00de\u00de \u2243 1\u00fe u \u00b7 \u00bd\u03a9\u00f0p; q\u00de \u00fe\u03a9\u00f0p \u2212 q;\u2212q\u00de ; \u00f035\u00de\nand thus, the q integration in (33) reduces to Z d2q \u00f02\u03c0\u00de2 \u00f01\u00fe u \u00b7 \u00bd\u03a9\u00f0p; q\u00de \u00fe\u03a9\u00f0p \u2212 q;\u2212q\u00de \u00dev 2\u00f0q2\u22a5\u00de\n\u00bc Z\nd2q \u00f02\u03c0\u00de2 \u00f01\u00fe 2u \u00b7\u03a9\u00f0p; q\u00de\u00dev 2\u00f0q2\u22a5\u00de; \u00f036\u00de\nwhere we have used the explicit form of \u03a9 in (15).\nNow, let us consider the term in which each propagator contributes with a factor of \u03c1\u0302. The additional \u03b4 function coming from the average of the \u03c1\u0302\u2019s sets the momentum exchange equal on both the amplitude and conjugate amplitude. Then, this contribution takes the following form: C Z L\u00fe\u03f5\nL dz\nZ L\u00fe\u03f5\nL dz0 Z d2q \u00f02\u03c0\u00de2 \u00f01\u00fe u \u00b7\u03a9\u00f0p; q\u00de\u00de 2v2\u00f0q2\u22a5\u00de\n\u00d7 \u03b4\u00f0z \u2212 z0\u00de\u03c1\u00f0z\u00de \u00d7 \u00f02\u03c0\u00de2\u03b4\u00f02\u00de\u00f0p \u2212 q \u2212 l\u00de\u00f02\u03c0\u00de2\u03b4\u00f02\u00de\u00f0p \u2212 q \u2212 l0\u00de: \u00f037\u00de\nSince the line z \u2212 z0 \u00bc 0 is always within the integration domain, the z integrations can be readily performed and one finds\nZ L\u00fe\u03f5\nL dz\nZ L\u00fe\u03f5\nL dz0\u03b4\u00f0z \u2212 z0\u00de\u03c1\u00f0z\u00de \u2243 \u03f5\u03c1\u00f0L\u00de: \u00f038\u00de\nUp to leading subeikonal order, we also have\n\u00f01\u00fe u \u00b7\u03a9\u00f0p; q\u00de\u00de2 \u2243 1\u00fe 2u \u00b7\u03a9\u00f0p; q\u00de; \u00f039\u00de\nand putting the single and the two double Born contributions together it is easy to see that\n074023-7\n1 dproj hTr\u00bdG\u2020\u00f0l0; L; p; L\u00fe \u03f5\u00deG\u00f0p; L\u00fe \u03f5; l; L\u00de i \u00bc \u00f02\u03c0\u00de4\u03b4\u00f02\u00de\u00f0p \u2212 l\u00de\u03b4\u00f02\u00de\u00f0l \u2212 l0\u00de\n\u2212 \u03f5 Z\nd2q \u00f02\u03c0\u00de2 \u03c3\u00f0p; q;L\u00de\u00f02\u03c0\u00de 4\u03b4\u00f02\u00de\u00f0p \u2212 q \u2212 l\u00de\n\u00d7 \u03b4\u00f02\u00de\u00f0l \u2212 l0\u00de \u00feO\u00f0\u03f52\u00de; \u00f040\u00de\nwhere we have introduced \u03c3\u00f0p; q;L\u00de, a specific combination of the in-medium color potentials in the GW model given by\n\u03c3\u00f0p;q;L\u00de \u00bc \u2212C\u03c1\u00f0L\u00de\u00f01\u00fe 2u \u00b7\u03a9\u00f0p;q\u00de\u00dev2\u00f0q2\u22a5\u00de\n\u00fe C\u03c1\u00f0L\u00de\u03b4\u00f02\u00de\u00f0q\u00de Z\nd2l\u00f01\u00fe 2u \u00b7\u03a9\u00f0p; l\u00de\u00dev2\u00f0l2\u22a5\u00de:\n\u00f041\u00de\nIts eikonal limit is related to the forward scattering amplitude for a color dipole, and it is often referred to as the dipole cross section or dipole potential.

However, the leading subeikonal terms related to the medium flow clearly break this separation, since the final distribution is sensitive to the slope of the energy dependence of the initial distribution, as it can be clearly seen in (63). This situation is similar to the case of broadening in inhomogeneous matter [16], where a spatial gradient of the coordinate space representation of the initial distribution appears coupled to the transverse gradients of the hydrodynamic parameters of the matter at leading subeikonal order, thus breaking the factorization. The main difference between these two types of leading subeikonal corrections relies in the fact that the energy dependence of the initial distribution plays a crucial role in the description of most jet observables, while this is not the case for its transverse spatial gradients. Hence, one may model the initial distribution in a way that its transverse spatial gradients vanish, taking the limit of a narrow distribution in momentum space E dN\n\u00f00\u00de d2pdE \u223c \u03b4 \u00f02\u00de\u00f0p\u00de as done in [16], whereas one can never disregard the energy derivative of the initial distribution in Eq. (63). Given that the derivation of (63) is kinematically restricted to t-channel interactions, the number of jets (partons) cannot change due to medium effects\nZ d2p\ndN d2pdE\n\u00bc Z d2p dN \u00f00\u00de\nd2pdE : \u00f064\u00de\nSince this unitarity condition is clearly satisfied by the eikonal broadening, we only need to check it for the flow effects arising at leading subeikonal order\nZ d2pd2p0 \u00f02\u03c0\u00de4 P\u00f01\u00de\u00f0p; L; p0; 0\u00de \u2212 u\n\u00b7 \u00f0p \u2212 p0\u00deP\u00f00\u00de\u00f0p; L; p0; 0\u00de \u2202\n\u2202E\nE\ndN \u00f00\u00de\nd2p0dE \u00bc 0: \u00f065\u00de\nFirst we notice that the angular integration in the second term in (65) is zero since P\u00f00\u00de\u00f0p; L; p0; 0\u00de is a function of jp \u2212 p0j only, as can be seen from (49). For the first term in (65), the p integration results in a delta function setting r \u00bc 0 in the integrand of (58). One can readily check that V\u00f00\u00de \u00bc 0 and V\u03b1\u03b2\u00f00\u00de \u00bc 0, as well as their first gradients, thus, giving a vanishing contribution which ensures unitarity. It was shown in [12] that, at leading order in opacity, flow effects lead to nonzero odd moments of the final momentum distribution, which would vanish in the case of isotropic broadening when the flow velocity is zero. Here, we extend this result to the case of multiple scatterings, accurate to all orders in the opacity expansion. To compare to the results in [12], let us consider the same family of moments of the momentum distribution\nhF\u00f0p\u00dei \u00bc R d2pF\u00f0p\u00de dNd2pdER d2p dN\n\u00f00\u00de d2pdE\n; \u00f066\u00de\nwith F\u00f0p\u00de \u00bc p2k\u22a5 p, and assume that the initial distribution is highly collimated\nE dN\u00f00\u00de\nd2pdE \u00bc f\u00f0E\u00de\u03b4\u00f02\u00de\u00f0p\u00de; \u00f067\u00de\nwhere f\u00f0E\u00de is some arbitrary energy dependence. We choose to focus on the odd moments since they are zero in the eikonal limit but receive a correction at first subeikonal order, as opposed to the even moments which are nonzero in the eikonal limit but the first nontrivial correction appears at second subeikonal order. Focusing on the first term of (63) and its contributions to (66), it can be easily seen why in the eikonal limit the odd moments of the momentum distribution are zero.

Indeed, since V\u00f0r\u00de,\u2207\u03b1V\u00f0r\u00de, and V\u03b1\u03b2\u00f0r\u00de are zero at r \u00bc 0, we find that for k \u00bc 0 the all-order result in (70) yields\nhpi\u00f01\u00de \u00bc \u2212u 2 f0\u00f0E\u00de f\u00f0E\u00de hp 2\u22a5i \u2212 i u 2E \u2207\u03b2fe\u2212V\u00f0r\u00deL\u00bdiL2\u00f0V\u00f0r\u00de\u03b4\u03b2\u03b3 \u00fe V\u03b2\u03b3\u00f0r\u00de\u00de\u2207\u03b3V\u00f0r\u00de \u2212 iL\u2207\u03b3V\u03b2\u03b3\u00f0r\u00de gjr\u00bc0\n\u00bc \u2212 u 2E\nC\u03c1L Z\nd2p \u00f02\u03c0\u00de2 p 2\u22a5 E f0\u00f0E\u00de f\u00f0E\u00de v 2\u00f0p\u22a5\u00de \u00fe p2\u22a5 \u2202v2\n\u2202p2\u22a5\n\u00f072\u00de\nwhich agrees with (71) for k \u00bc 0. In general, for integer k > 0, the opacity series up to k\u00fe 1th order is necessary to obtain the exact all-order result. The momentum integrals in (69) are well defined for k > \u22121. However, we are also interested in comparing with the result for k \u00bc \u22121 obtained at leading order in opacity in [12], and thus we have to be careful with their regularization. Since the additional insertions of V in (69) make the momentum integrals more convergent, the only possibly divergent term in this equation is the zeroth order in opacity (or equivalently, the L \u00bc 0 contribution). This contribution is expected to disappear though, since in the absence of matter the broadening effects are controlled by the initial distribution (67) and one has to regulate (69) accordingly. Indeed, if we take L \u00bc 0 in (63), then up to the first subeikonal order the corresponding moment reads\np p2\u22a5 L\u00bc0 \u00bc 1 N Z d2pd2p0 \u00f02\u03c0\u00de2 p p2\u22a5 \u03b4\u00f02\u00de\u00f0p \u2212 p0\u00de 1 \u2212 u \u00b7 \u00f0p \u2212 p0\u00de \u2202 \u2202E dN \u00f00\u00de d2p0dE ; \u00f073\u00de\nwhere N is a normalization factor. Assuming that the initial distribution is isotropic, and has a small but finite width, we find that hp=p2\u22a5ijL\u00bc0 \u00bc 0 after angular integration. To first order in opacity, all momentum integrals are well defined and (71) is still valid. Using the explicit form of v from the GW model given in (3), we get\np p2\u22a5 \u00f01\u00de N\u00bc1 \u00bc \u2212\u03c7 u 2 f0\u00f0E\u00de f\u00f0E\u00de \u2212 1 E ; \u00f074\u00de\nwhere we have introduced the opacity \u03c7 \u2261 Cg4\u03c1L=\u00f04\u03c0\u03bc2\u00de. This result is, as expected, in full agreement with the outcome of [12]. It is also interesting to compare hp=p2\u22a5ijN\u00bc1 with the full result accurate to all orders in opacity. In order to do so, we regularize hp2k\u22a5 pi for k \u00bc \u22121 in (69) with a finite mass\n074023-11\np p2\u22a5 \u00fem2 \u00f01\u00de \u00bc \u2212u 2 f0\u00f0E\u00de f\u00f0E\u00de Z d2pd2r \u00f02\u03c0\u00de2 p2\u22a5 p2\u22a5 \u00fem2 e\u2212ip\u00b7re\u2212V\u00f0r\u00deL \u00fe Z d2pd2r \u00f02\u03c0\u00de2 p p2\u22a5 \u00fem2 e\u2212ip\u00b7r\n\u00d7 e\u2212V\u00f0r\u00deL u\u03b1 E \u00bdiL2\u00f0V\u00f0r\u00de\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 \u00fe V\u03b1\u03b2\u00f0r\u00de\u00de\u2207\u03b2V\u00f0r\u00de \u2212 iL\u2207\u03b2V\u03b1\u03b2\u00f0r\u00de ; \u00f075\u00de\nwhich can be numerically evaluated.

Notice also that we have omitted the superscript for brevity. We illustrate the full dependence of the all order result on the opacity variable \u03c7 in Fig. 2 where we present the numerical evaluation of (76) for n \u00bc 4, with m sufficiently small, and with the L \u00bc 0 contribution subtracted for stability. The curve clearly shows a linear behavior for small values of \u03c7, consistent with the N \u00bc 1 result in Eq. (74). For larger values of \u03c7, however, the curve saturates. This latter property is not present at any fixed order in the opacity expansion, thus showing how the resummed picture is essential to describe some observables in dense nuclear matter."

            "text": "In this paper, we study how jets interact with homogeneous flowing QCD matter accounting for multiple interactions of the leading parton with the medium. By combining the leading subeikonal terms obtained at first order in opacity in [12] with the resummation techniques of the BDMPS-Z framework (which resums all orders in opacity in the eikonal limit), we succeed in finding the\nleading subeikonal corrections to the in-medium parton propagation to all orders in opacity. This is achieved at the amplitude level by deriving a single-particle in-medium propagator, see (23) and (24). This result is then used to obtain the jet broadening distribution by computing the medium average of two propagators. Having a preferred direction set by the flow velocity clearly breaks azimuthal symmetry, and thus induces an anisotropy in the corresponding momentum distributions. In order to quantify and illustrate this effect, we have obtained the odd moments of the final state distribution hp2k\u22a5 pi, which, contrary to the static case, do not vanish, and thus serve as the simplest probe of flow effects in jet-medium interactions. As expected, our all-order in opacity result agrees with the first order case examined in [12] in the small opacity limit. In particular we have analyzed two specific cases: k \u00bc 0 where the first order in opacity gives the exact (all-order) result, and k \u00bc \u22121 where a complete description can only be achieved when all orders in opacity are resummed. Now that we have an expression for the in-medium propagator in the presence of flow and know how to compute medium averages of products of these propagators, the next natural step would be to derive the mediuminduced radiation spectrum to all orders in opacity (including flow). This will be addressed in a separate publication. In principle, one would expect in-medium radiation, and more generally jet substructure observables, to be more sensitive to the transverse dynamics of the medium as daughter partons are less energetic. Further analyses on jet observables, in the direction of [14] and extensions to the all-order in opacity calculations, will thus provide additional tools for studying the medium flow. It is worth emphasizing that the formalism developed here can in principle be adapted to be used in general nuclear matter (hot or cold), where, in some cases, modeling the medium as a background field, like in Eq. (2), is still a reasonable approximation. Incorporating the effects of collective motion to jet observables for small collision systems may help elucidating the origin of the nonzero flow harmonics in proton-ion collisions or the recent measurements on high-pT jet-v2. In this direction, it would\n074023-12\nbe interesting to compare the results arising from our formalism both to recent developments in the subeikonal expansion in the CGC context [48,49], and to calculations of broadening in the glasma phase in the early stages of heavy ion collisions yielding to sizable anisotropies [15,50,51]. Similarly, one may attempt applying the developed description in the context of probe-matter interaction in deep inelastic scattering, see e.g., [18,26,31,52\u201357], where the anisotropy is caused for instance by collective motion of nucleons. Finally, it would also be interesting to gain insight into the sensitivity of medium evolution effects to the strength of the interactions. In the case of strongly coupled holographic models, the effects due to flow, hydrodynamic gradients, and background fields have been studied for a wide variety of hard probes [58\u201367]. The framework developed in this paper, along with the results in [12,16], could be used to provide the weak coupling counterpart of these analyses."
