In our parent \u201cQuitLink\u201d randomized controlled trial (RCT), slower than\nexpected peer researcher facilitated recruitment, along with the impact of COVID-19\npandemic restrictions, necessitated an adaptive recruitment response. The objectives of\nthe present study were to: (i) describe adaptive peer researcher facilitated recruitment\nstrategies; (ii) explore the effectiveness of these strategies; (iii) investigate whether\nrecruitment strategies reached different subgroups of participants; and (iv) examine\nthe costs and resources required for implementing these strategies. Finally, we offer\nexperience-based lessons in a Peer Researcher Commentary.\nMethods: People were included in the RCT if they smoked at least 10 cigarettes a day\nandwere accessingmental health support from the project\u2019s two partneringmental health\norganizations in Victoria, Australia. The majority of people accessing these services will\nhave been diagnosed with SMI. Recruitment occurred over 2 years. We began with peer\nfacilitated recruitment strategies delivered face-to-face, then replaced this with direct mail\npostcards followed by telephone contact. In the final 4 months of the study, we began\nonline recruitment, broadening it to people who smoked and were accessing support\nor treatment (including from general practitioners) for mental health and/or alcohol or\nother drug problems, anywhere in the state of Victoria. Differences between recruitment\nstrategies on key participant variables were assessed. We calculated the average cost\nper enrolee of the different recruitment approaches.\nResults: Only 109 people were recruited from a target of 382: 29 via face-to-face (March\n2019 to April 2020), 66 from postcards (May 2020 to November 2020), and 14 from\nonline (November to December 2020 and January to March 2021) strategies. Reflecting\nour initial focus on recruiting from supported independent living accommodation facilities,\nparticipants recruited face-to-face were significantly more likely to be living in partially or\nfully supported independent living (n = 29, <0.001), but the samples were otherwise\nsimilar. After the initial investment in training and equipping peer researchers, the average\ncost of recruitment was AU$1,182 per participant\u2014\u223cUS$850. Face-to-face recruitment\nwas the most expensive approach and postcard recruitment the least (AU$1,648 and\nAU$928 per participant).\nDiscussion: Peer researcher facilitated recruitment into a tobacco treatment trial\nwas difficult and expensive. Widely dispersed services and COVID-19 restrictions\nnecessitated non-face-to-face recruitment strategies, such as direct mail postcards,\nwhich improved recruitment and may be worthy of further research.\nClinical Trial Registration: The trial is registered with ANZCTR (www.anzctr.org.au):\nACTRN12619000244101 prior to the accrual of the first participant and updated regularly\nas per registry guidelines. The trial sponsor was the University of Newcastle, NSW,\nAustralia.\nKeywords: tobacco treatment, smoking cessation, quitline, peer worker, mental illness, recruitment, cost analysis, severe mental illness (SMI)"

            "text": "Smoking rates are much higher among people who experience severe mental illness (SMI) compared to the general population (1). Consequently, people with SMI experience poorer quality of life related to smoking (2) and die prematurely from smoking related diseases (3). There is strong evidence that tobacco treatment consisting of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and pharmacotherapy (such as nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and varenicline) are associated with reductions in smoking and cardiovascular disease risk among people with SMI (4) and that such interventions can be delivered effectively by telephone (5). However, use of quitlines tends to be low relative to their potential reach (6) and research regarding scalable, low-cost efforts to increase quitline reach is critically needed to reduce tobacco related health disparities (7).\nPeer workers are individuals who provide services in mental health and/or substance use treatment settings informed by their own experience of recovery frommental illness and/or substance use and skills obtained from formal peer worker training (8, 9). We have previously reported on the successful delivery of a peer worker delivered smoking cessation and healthy lifestyle intervention among people who experience SMI (10). In that feasibility study, we received 104 referrals from one community mental health organization, with 43 people being included in the study over a 1-year period (10). Dickerson et al. (11) reported\na pilot trial which recruited 30 people with SMI into a peer delivered smoking intervention over a 6-month period (11). Given the positive but modest reach of peer delivered smoking cessation interventions and the potential for higher reach of quitlines, peer workers may be able to enhance reach of quitlines to people with SMI, by identifying smokers within mental health services and facilitating referral to quitlines. As such, we conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT, the \u201cQuitlink Project\u201d) evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a peer worker facilitated intervention for smoking among people accessing support for SMI (12, 13).\nOne of the most challenging aspects of conducting intervention trials among people who experience SMI is recruitment (14, 15). Challenges include: the necessity for extensive collaborations between researchers, consumers, health staff and institutions, each with their own expectations and concerns; clinicians\u2019 concerns about consumers\u2019 vulnerability and reduced decision-making ability; and consumer doubts about potential benefits in the face of lengthy research procedures (16). High caseloads and clinical staff feeling they do not have the necessary knowledge of research to feel comfortable discussing this with service users have also been identified as barriers to recruitment (17). In their systematic review of recruitment strategies in mental health trials, Liu et al. (16) found only two RCTs cited among people who experience SMI that formally assessed the effectiveness of different strategies to improve\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 2 May 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 869169\nrecruitment (18, 19). Neither multi-media consent procedures nor co-designed participant invitation leaflets were associated with improved recruitment. Clearly, in the face of numerous challenges, recruitment into a study needs to be appealing to staff and consumers and not represent a burden for staff.\nThere are additional challenges recruiting for studies of interventions for substance use, like smoking, due to high levels of ambivalence among potential participants. People experiencing SMI who smoke report being interested in quitting but may not feel ready to do so in the short-term (20). Recruitment processes need to be sufficiently attractive to people who do and do not want to quit smoking in the near future.\nGlobally, individuals receiving treatment for mental illness and/or substance use have faced unprecedented challenges during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. They are at elevated risk of vulnerability to COVID-19 associated with co-occurring health conditions and mental health sequelae arising from isolation and socioeconomic instability (21). During the pandemic, there was a significant divergence from routine care in Australia, with increased use of telehealth. Given our interest in potentially linking people with SMI who smoke to quitline, the characteristics of those who enrolled in our study are of interest and may help inform further uptake of the use of quitlines, post-pandemic.\nPeer workers are strong role models for clients, and are particularly successful in developing hope, promoting self-esteem and empowering consumers (22). These unique skills are likely to be extremely valuable in helping to promote engagement of people with SMI within quitline services (23). In our Quitlink Project, peer workers were engaged as peer researchers, recruiting participants, collecting baseline data and delivering brief advice. We initially developed a peer delivered (face-toface) recruitment strategy. Slower than expected recruitment and social distancing requirements and other restrictions of the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated an adaptive recruitment response, involving progressively less intensive peer facilitation. As described further below, peer facilitation was adapted from face-to-face contact with participants, to direct mail postcards with telephone contact, and then online peer researcher video presentations. Inclusion criteria were also modified to broaden the reach of the project beyond the original two mental health partner organizations involved and baseline assessment was abbreviated to allow administration via telephone and online.\nThere is a marked lack of evidence on the costs and recruitment effectiveness for tobacco treatment trials targeting people who experience mental illness (15, 16). Potential insights may be drawn from smoking recruitment studies amongst general populations (24) and Liu et al\u2019s. (16) systematic review of recruitment studies for mental health trials (i.e., not tobacco treatment studies). Buller et al. (24) found online advertisements could be a relatively effective and inexpensive recruitment approach (US$43.35 per enrollee, N = 1,426) compared with recruiting via quitline screening (US$133.61, N = 149). Liu et al. (16) found web-based advertisements could be an inexpensive way to recruit people to mental health\nRCTs compared with generating referrals from specialized care or primary care (UK\u00a313.41 vs. UK\u00a3183.24 vs. UK\u00a3407.65 per patient enrolled, respectively). We anticipated recruiting to our study would be relatively more resource intensive than these studies, given we aimed to target people who experience both mental illness and tobacco dependence. Here we report on three different peer facilitated recruitment strategies, and the associated costs. The peer researchers employed on the project also report on their experiences of recruitment in a Peer Researcher Commentary."

Two peer researchers (NC and MMc) were each employed 2 days per week, with one increasing to 3 days per week during the last 6 months of recruitment. A third peer researcher (CB) assisted with administrative aspects of recruitment half a day a week as recruitment progressed. Peer workers assisted with a parallel qualitative study when they had spare time. Their work was guided by a peer manual co-designed by NC; it contains introductory scripts and detailed descriptions of study procedures. Both peer researchers received two and a half days face-to-face training on recruitment procedures by chief investigators (ALB and PJK) and one peer researcher received an additional 3 days training (by EF) on using an iPad for data entry etc. Peer researchers were observed visiting initial sites, conducting baseline assessments and delivering brief advice. Two peer researchers had formerly smoked and the other had never smoked.\nPeer researchers visited various sites of the two partnering mental health organizations presenting information to staff and potential participants about the study and leaving postcards about the study and consent-to-contact forms. Supported independent living accommodation facilities were targeted, and some community services were also visited. Service staff were asked to refer potential participants using the consent-to-contact forms. This stage of recruitment also included advertising (e.g., flyers in residential and community services and online service newsletters). Peer researchers used iPads to guide potential participants through eligibility and consent procedures and to gather baseline data via REDCap (a secure web-based application\ndesigned to support data capture for research studies). Baseline data collection took around 1.5 h per participant.\n2) Direct mail postcard (May 2020 to November 2020)\nThe second recruitment method involved two staggered direct mail postcard campaigns to all people registered with the project\u2019s two partnering mental health organizations (smoking status is not recorded on organization registers). Postcards were developed in conjunction with peer researchers (see Supplementary Material). The first postcard contained the project logo and brief information about the project and contact details of the peer researchers. The second postcard was the same except for a new background photo of two people in conversation. Postcards invited people registered with either participating mental health organization who smoked at least 10 cigarettes per day to telephone peer researchers to find out more about the study. Peer researchers obtained verbal consent via telephone to participate in the study and conducted an abbreviated baseline assessment. A shorter baseline assessment was necessary due to the assessment interview being conducted over the phone, to reduce participant burden, and took about 30\u201345min. Both of the postcard mail outs were staggered over 3 months (May to July 2020 and September to November 2020) in order to accommodate availability of peer researchers to respond to potential participants. A postage service used by one of the mental health organizations was paid to send the postcards.\n3) Online (November to December 2020 and January to March 2021)\nWith our recruitment rate improved by direct mail postcards (as described below) but still lower than anticipated, we broadened recruitment beyond the initial two mental health organizations. Ethics permission was granted to extend recruitment to people who smoked and were accessing support or treatment (including from general practitioners) for mental health and/or alcohol or other drug problems, anywhere in the state of Victoria. A study website was developed and the study was advertised via paid advertisements on Facebook, newsletters of community organizations and professionals and a register of substance use studies. Social media posts are attached in Supplementary Material. Online recruitment involved investigator and peer researcher videos explaining the study and consent procedures, asking interested people to either telephone peer researchers or complete online screening, consent and baseline assessments."

            "text": "Peer researcher facilitated recruitment into this tobacco treatment trial among people experiencing SMI was difficult and relatively expensive compared to recruitment to other smoking or mental health trials (16, 24). Even if all three recruitment strategies (face-to-face, direct mail postcards and online) had been able to occur simultaneously and assuming observed recruitment rates held constant over a longer recruitment period, it would have taken almost 3 years to achieve the target sample. Similarly, if we were able to identify and access new recipient population mail lists and just employed our most effective approach, direct mail postcards with telephone contact with peer researchers, without more peer researchers to field calls, it would take around 6 years. However, our a priori expectations were that recruitment of this socially marginalized population group to a smoking cessation study would require greater resources than other smoking and mental health studies (15), and important lessons have been learnt about peer researcher involvement, and the potential for direct mail postcards that may inform future research and clinical practice.\nIn the context of our RCT during the COVID-19 pandemic and with a limited timeline, recruitment was well below our original target. Unexpectedly, recruitment by peer researchers face-to-face before COVID-19 was slow, despite existing CI partnerships with participating mental health organizations. In contrast, the SCIMITAR+ Trial in the UK (38) recruited 526 participants into their tobacco treatment trial among people experiencing SMI (those with current drug or alcohol abuse were excluded) in just over a year. Successful recruitment was associated with use of NHS targets such as supporting access to research projects to encourage team engagement and establishing close working relationships between researchers and clinicians.

SCIMITAR researchers screened caseloads for eligible participants and attended the next meeting with the potential participant in order to discuss the study.\nShortly prior to our study commencing, there was a major shift in service delivery in Australia, with the introduction of Australia\u2019s National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). This severely impacted our study. One of the participating mental health organizations decided not to engage with the study due to the restructuring process. The residential services which we did recruit from shifted focus from residential rehabilitation to supported independent living, with eligible residents\u2019 capacity to live independently being impacted by long-term mental illhealth and having levels of psychosocial disability that required assistance with activities for daily living. All residents of the supported accommodation facilities were eligible for NDIS support that requires evidence of permanent and significant disability that affects the individual\u2019s ability to take part in\neveryday activities. Thus, residents were people who may have faced significant challenges in participating in this trial without considerable support. This face-to-face recruitment was also relatively resource intensive. Prior to pivoting to postcard recruitment our average cost per enrollee via face-to-face was about $1,648 per participant. However, regardless of expense, different recruitment strategies and settings will provide different sub-samples, enhancing representativeness of the data.\nIt is possible that more frequent visits to residential settings by peer workers, working locally within teams, may have had better success. One report (39) of recruitment of people with schizophrenia into a coronary heart disease prevention intervention required an average 10.3 home occupational therapy visits to recruit a participant. The number of required visits were influenced by potential participants forgetting appointments, having difficulty assimilating study information, and also perceiving the generally welcomed research occupational therapist visits might terminate once consent was provided. Such frequent visits would not be possible in our study, with one of our participating organizations being widely dispersed\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 9 May 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 869169\nthroughout Victoria with multiple sites and different points of service delivery in urban areas and regional towns across long distances. Also, with the introduction of the NDIS and the shift to a more individualized funding approach, there was less group and center-based activities that would have enabled direct contact with potential participants.\nWe were unsuccessful in attracting mental health inpatients into our trial, although that had been successful in other studies (40). A potential explanation is that service delivery has become increasingly acute and pressured in recent years in Victoria, as detailed by the Royal Commission into Victoria\u2019s Mental Health Service System which was being conducted during the recruitment period (41), and together with COVID19 restrictions, the inpatient setting was unlikely to become a source of recruitment during the study. Thus, although we had partnerships with the recruiting organizations, our peer researchers were not as strongly embedded within services as they were in the SCIMITAR+trial (39) and we were unable to make as many visits to sites as others have done due to statewide and dispersed service delivery (39). Peer researchers were facing services that had competing priorities and significant organizational disruption.\nIn future, establishing organizational targets for delivery of smoking interventions and possibly pairing peer workers with clinician champions in further studies or in clinical contexts may help build closer working relationships and better uptake of interventions in residential and inpatient contexts. Although challenging, it is important people within these settings receive opportunities for tobacco treatment and for representativeness in research. It is possible that financial incentives for service providers to refer could be effective because of the time constraints and overwhelming administrative work that compete with research and represent important barriers (42). In addition, although peer researchers may be able to connect effectively with consumers, there appears to be a need for alternative strategies and different messaging to engage staff andmanagers and explain the benefits of a trial such as this. RCTs can be an even harder \u201csell\u201d when staff know only half of participants will receive an active intervention. In the current trial, we limited disclosure about intervention arm contents, but staff sometimes asked whether participants would all receive NRT. Future research needs to align with service organization goals and strategy at all levels\u2014executive, managerial, and for practitioners. In the case of the present study, service organization goals and strategies may have been shifting quickly with the advent of the NDIS. With so many pressures, organizations are likely to prioritize activities with a clear pay off for clients and the organization.\nAs recruitment from community residential facilities was comparatively low and unsuccessful from acute inpatient units in this study, additional ways to link mental health consumers in those settings to quitline is worthy of further investigation. For example, in a randomized trial with 224 individuals recruited from a locked acute psychiatry unit with a smoking ban, verified smoking 7-day point prevalence abstinence over 18-months follow-up was significantly higher for those who received a computer-assisted tobacco intervention with posthospitalization NRT (20.0%) vs. usual care (7.7%) (43). Such computer delivered interventions could also provide referrals to quitline, with\nquitline staff potentially beginning communication with people who smoke via text or telephone, with follow-up after discharge.\nRecruitment via direct mail postcards, inviting people registered with mental health organizations who smoked to telephone peer researchers to find out more about the study, was relatively successful. We began sending out postcards a year after face-to-face recruitment commenced, hoping to improve the rate of recruitment through reaching more people and to recruit in a COVID-safe manner. As described above, peer researchers obtained verbal consent via telephone from participants and a shorter baseline assessment was implemented. People recruited via postcard did not differ from other recruitment strategies, apart from residential status. Our recruitment rate (1.6%; 66 participants from postcards to approximately 4200 people over two occasions) is similar to that of other health intervention studies recruiting by postcard. For example, in a study recruiting young people for a randomized trial of weight gain prevention interventions, Crane et al. (44) mailed postcards once to 30,000 people, with 30 being randomized into the study (1.3% response rate), costing US $7,422; $247.40 per participant. They found little difference in reach between postcards and brochures (sent to a separate sample). Waltman et al. (45) mailed postcards to 72,469 women and resent them 6 months later, with 47 participants enrolling in a RCT of different interventions on bone health (0.07% response rate). The total cost of postcard recruitment was US $43,567.49; $926.96 per participant (the cost of researchers\u2019 time in implementing recruitment strategies was not considered in the calculation), which is comparable to our average cost of postcard recruitment of AU$928 per participant (including researcher time), suggesting recruitment to trials requiring difficult behavior change can be expensive. In Waltman et al. (45), postcards were the second most successful recruitment strategy after health care provider letters (n = 58) and similar to Facebook posts (n = 44); lower numbers were obtained from referral by family and friends (n = 11), newspaper or television advertisements (n = 5) and digital advertisements (n = 2). Waltman et al. regarded health care provider letters and postcards as successful in helping to reach their overall target of 275 participants. In hindsight, we could have had postcard recruitment running alongside face-to-face recruitment and may have been able to attract about 66 people annually, this would likely have introduced some efficiencies in peer researcher and investigator supervision time. In the present study, the mental health organizations involved did not have a record of smoking status so we had to send postcards to all people registered by the organizations. It would obviously be cheaper to send postcards if registries kept smoking status and other risk factor information for targeted health marketing. However, sending postcards to everyone has the advantage of capturing new and unrecorded smokers. Response to postcards was stronger following the second mail out. Peer researchers reported that respondents often commented that the second postcard prompted them to call. Even though we did not reach our recruitment target for the study, direct mail postcards every 6 months to people registered with mental health services, with the option of phoning a peer worker or quitline directly, may be a relatively effective way of increasing contact with quitlines.\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 10 May 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 869169\nOur online recruitment strategy was the least costly in total (AU$19,820) but was only implemented for the 4 months before trial closure, resulting in 14 participants ($1,416 per participant). Qualitative research with participants is currently underway to develop a more in-depth understanding of participant experiences. However, we do not have any information about why several thousand views online led to so few enrolments. It is possible the lengthy information and consent forms mandated by ethics committees did not engage people sufficiently online. Interestingly, a recent study of recruitment into an online intervention among people with SMI aimed for a sample size of 148 over 2 years and recruited only 98 (46). Had we started online recruitment at the commencement of our study, and assuming a similar rate over our 2-year recruitment period, we would have recruited about 84 participants by that method.\nThere is a paucity of directly comparable cost analyses for recruitment to smoking cessation studies. Buller et al. (24) recruited participants at a much lower cost per participant, but they did not target people who experience SMI. Whilst hindsight reveals some potential sources of efficiencies for our project, recruiting to such studies is resource intensive. However, it is important to put this in the context of the potential cost offsets to be gained from facilitating the prevention of smoking related illness. For example, Golsbury et al. estimate the average additional health costs for an Australian diagnosed with lung cancer between 45 and 60 years old is AU$67,689 (47). In addition, a qualitative study among the participants of the present trial reported that the peer researcher and quitline interventions in the Quitlink study have been highly valued as compassionate approaches that have the potential to assist people on a journey to quitting (McCarter et al., submitted1).\nTraining of peer researchers for this study, preparation of a detailed peer researcher manual and ongoing supervision was necessary as the peer researchers had not assisted on an RCT before and the baseline assessments were initially quite long and were administered on an iPad linked to REDcap. One solution may have been to have experienced research assistants work alongside the peer researchers. However, once such peer researchers are trained, they form an important element of the peer researcher workforce to be engaged with future studies and also help to train and support others. In Australia, the peer research workforce is limited and needs support and resourcing for future development. Lived experience is increasingly seen as a discipline, with potential of forming a recognized profession (48). This also enhances the potential for co-design of strategies to improve research activities, including recruitment. Alongside the need for this level of peer researcher training and expertise, efficiencies in postcard recruitment, involving telephone contact with peer researchers and a briefer assessment conducted over the phone (in the context of a RCT), could be a useful model for peer telehealth interventions in the age of COVID-19 but also more broadly with widely dispersed services. Nevertheless, structural impediments to postcard effectiveness, such as unstable housing\n1McCarter K, McKinlay M, Cocks N, Brasier C, Hayes L, Baker A, et al. (submitted).

Peer researchers found that setting a limit of two interviews a day was manageable in terms of self-care and administrative burden. Upon reflection, the peer researchers recommend developing debriefing, more opportunities for peer-to-peer support and access to peer supervision from a more experienced peer researcher, and other potential support for the peer researchers as a part of the study design for future studies. Future studies are encouraged to include lived experience investigators, this can help anchor the lived experience perspective and increase the ease with which the study can provide support to its peer workforce."

            "heading": "LIMITATIONS",
            "text": "One of the main limitations of the present study is that we failed to recruit the intended sample of 382 people. However, this experience allowed us to adapt our recruitment strategies, and compare them. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the three strategies did not occur concurrently and were active for varying lengths of time. Further, the proportion of people included in the trial via each recruitment strategy may not be truly representative of all those invited or offered recruitment in the trial. Another limitation is that we did not compare peer researcher recruitment with alternative non-peer strategies of recruitment. Alternative approaches, such as computer delivered information about the study, accompanied by a brief intervention with a link to quitline in residential settings or use of \u201copt out\u201d rather than \u201copt in\u201d strategies when people who smoke newly present to mental health services may have yielded different results. There remains an opportunity to co-design these strategies with people with lived experience including peer researchers. COVID-19may have confounded some of themeasures in the study, with smoking and other substance use potentially rising and quality of life declining during the pandemic.\nChanges in investigators may have influenced recruitment, with CI Brophy departing one of the main organizations from which we recruited early in the study and CI Castle leaving the other main site later in the study, potentially lessening active commitment from organizations involved. Our peer researcher lead, who had been very active in developing the study, retired just as the study began. In hindsight, a replacement for a peer researcher lead may have addressed peer researcher needs for supervision in addition to that provided by the CI.\nThe main organizations in the study were comprised of widely dispersed services, necessitating travel over long distances. As peer researchers were embedded at head offices of the organizations, developing an ongoing recruitment routine was\ndifficult. Future studies may more fruitfully employ peer researchers already attached to local services to establish recruitment protocols into practice. Victoria\u2019s clinical services have become more oriented to crisis care and are characterized by supporting large numbers of people considered to have SMI with complex needs and many are on compulsory orders (41). This challenging service delivery environment may have lowered expectations of staff and contributed to lower recruitment.\nIn terms of methodology, we did not audio record peer researchers\u2019 interactions with participants to monitor fidelity to the recruitment procedures. Peer researchers thought recording interactions may have been declined by most people. However, some measure of fidelity, perhaps a checklist, may have given a better sense of fidelity to the peer recruitment manual. On the other hand, at commencement on the project, CIs shadowed peer researchers in delivering the recruitment information and recruitment process, observing baseline assessment, randomization and feedback to participants. Finally, some participants did not complete the MINI, so diagnosis is only available on 91 people."

            "heading": "CONCLUSIONS",
            "text": "Recruitment of a broad range of people experiencing SMI (i.e., including those with alcohol and other drug issues and those living in supported accommodation) into our smoking intervention study was difficult and expensive. The recruitment rate we achieved was far lower than targeted and required us to adapt and develop a range of recruitment strategies. Faceto-face, direct mail postcard followed by telephone contact and online recruitment required different degrees of peer researcher involvement. These recruitment strategies could run in parallel to help attract people experiencing SMI into smoking interventions in clinical settings. This study relied on the commitment of partner organizations that are often operating in the context of competing priorities. Maintaining engagement from when a research project is formulated through to its implementation requires consistent and thoughtful planning that considers changes in leadership and other disruptions. Acknowledging that staff have an important role to play in enabling recruitment requires ensuring they are supported to understand the value of tobacco treatment. A proactive longer-term view of continually recruiting into tobacco treatment is needed in community mental health organizations, alongside preventive approaches to discourage uptake of smoking. Early and continued physical health intervention from first mental health presentation is vital (5) and tobacco treatment should be part of this approach."
