    "abstractText": "A novel co-encapsulation system called bicosomes (bicelles within liposomes) has been developed to overcome the limitations associated with the topical application of curcumin (cur) and \u03b1-tocopherol (\u03b1-toc). The physicochemical properties and biological activity in vitro of bicosome systems were evaluated. Bicelles were prepared with DPPC, DHPC, cur, and \u03b1-toc (cur/\u03b1-toc-bicelles). Liposomal vesicles loading cur/\u03b1-toc-bicelles were prepared with Lipoid P-100 and cholesterol-forming cur/\u03b1-toc-bicosomes. Three cur/\u03b1-toc-bicosomes were evaluated using different total lipid percentages (12, 16, and 20% w/v). The results indicated that formulations manage to solubilize cur and \u03b1-toc in homogeneous bicelles < 20 nm, while the bicosomes reaches 303\u2013420 nm depending on the total lipid percentage in the systems. Bicosomes demonstrated high-encapsulation efficiency (EE) for cur (56\u201377%) and \u03b1-toc (51\u201365%). The loading capacity (LC) for both antioxidant compounds was 52\u201367%. In addition, cur/\u03b1-toc-bicosomes decreased the lipid oxidation by 52% and increased the antioxidant activity by 60% compared to unloaded bicosomes. The cell viability of these cur/\u03b1-toc-bicosomes was >85% in fibroblasts (3T3L1/CL-173TM) and \u226565% in keratinocytes (Ha-CaT) and proved to be hematologically compatible. The cur/\u03b1-toc-bicelles and cur/\u03b1-toc-bicosomes inhibited the growth of C. albicans in a range between 33 and 76%. Our results propose bicosome systems as a novel carrier able to co-encapsulate, solubilize, protect, and improve the delivery performance of antioxidant molecules. The relevance of these findings is based on the synergistic antioxidant effect of its components, its biocompatibility, and its efficacy for dermal tissue treatment damaged by oxidative stress or by the presence of C. albicans. However, further studies are needed to assess the efficacy and safety of cur/\u03b1-toc bicosomes in vitro and in vivo.",

            "text": "In recent years, antioxidant compounds have attracted the attention of researchers due to their diverse dermatological, pharmaceutical, and biological functions. These compounds exhibit characteristics such as free radical scavenging, melanin reduction, wound healing, and light protection. [1,2]. Curcumin (cur) is a hydrophobic polyphenol extracted from the rhizome of Curcuma longa [3]. Several studies have demonstrated the\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 1912. https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics15071912 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceutics\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 1912 2 of 19\nbiological activity of cur, which includes antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, anticancer, and wound-healing effects [4]. On the other hand, \u03b1-tocopherol (\u03b1-toc) is the most active and effective form of vitamin E, which is widely distributed in nature and used as an antioxidant in the food, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical industries [5\u20137]. In addition, the topical application of \u03b1-toc has been proven to have a protective effect on the skin and accelerate wound closure [8]. Furthermore, due to its peroxyl radical-scavenging activity, \u03b1-toc can help protect the phospholipids and fatty acids in the skin\u2019s membrane [1]. Despite the remarkable effectiveness of cur and \u03b1-toc in dermatological applications, its therapeutic value is limited by several factors. Cur exhibits poor aqueous solubility (<0.1 mg/mL), low physicochemical stability, unsustainable bioavailability, low skin permeability and fast metabolism that contribute to low cur levels in tissues [9\u201312]. On the other hand, \u03b1-toc is easily oxidized by atmospheric oxygen, shows low solubility in water (~30 mg/L) and high sensitivity to light, and some skin irritation issues have been described limiting its application and incorporation in products [13,14]. These challenges represent significant obstacles to achieving optimal topical and systemic efficacy of cur and \u03b1-toc. To overcome these drawbacks, the development of co-encapsulation delivery systems offers several advantages, including the protection of therapeutic molecules and integrity, facilitation of incorporation, formulation flexibility in terms of ratio and dosage, controlled release capabilities, and the potential for synergistic effects when multiple therapeutic molecules are incorporated [15,16]. The construction of innovative co-encapsulation administration systems is crucial for the advancement of new products for dermatological applications [17]. Bicosome systems are phospholipid assemblies based on mixtures of discoidal structures called bicelles and spherical vesicles called liposomes. Studies propose the use of phospholipid-based bicelles for dermatological applications owing to their lipid composition and their small size (15\u201325 nm in diameter and 4\u20136 nm thick), suitable enough for passing through the skin (stratum corneum) [18]. However, in high-dilution conditions, small discoidal bicelles become large structures such as vesicles, lamellar sheets, and rodlike micelles losing their specific properties. To maintain the size and shape of the small discoidal bicelles, Rodriguez et al. [19] suggested that bicelles can be encapsulated in larger spherical vesicles liposomes. These liposomal vesicles, with diameters ranging from 100 nm to 1 mm, are too large to pass through the skin for transdermal application; however, they are morphologically stable under high-dilution conditions and thus are good carriers for the systemic application of therapeutic molecules. When bicosome structures contact the skin surface, the external vesicle (liposome) fuses on the skin surface, while the discoidal bicelles selectively penetrate the lipid inter-corneocyte spaces to reach the target skin layers [20]. Previous studies on the application of these systems have shown that treatment with bicosomes containing ceramides improves the dermatitis skin condition in vivo by reinforcing the skin barrier function and reducing the skin inflammation [21]. Furthermore, bicosome systems have demonstrated their ability to effectively incorporate lipophilic and hydrophilic antioxidants [22]. Fern\u00e1ndez et al. [23] evaluated the antioxidant protective effect of bicosomes that incorporate \u03b2-carotene against infrared radiation by measuring the formation of free radicals. Results indicated that treatment with \u03b2-carotene-loaded bicosomes reduces free radical formation, preserves collagen structure, and protects antioxidant \u03b2-carotene against radiation, demonstrating the potent efficacy of bicosomes in protecting skin exposed to infrared radiation [24,25]. Considering the important effects of cur and \u03b1-toc on oxidative processes and skin damage repair and the advantages of bicosomes as carrier and delivery systems [26,27], the co-encapsulation of cur and \u03b1-toc into bicosomes (cur/\u03b1-toc-bicosomes) is proposed. To the best of our knowledge, liposomal vesicles have been successfully used to load cur and \u03b1-toc, respectively [11,28]; however, there has been no reference to simultaneous encapsulation in a bicosome co-delivery system as described above. The aims of the present study were to develop and characterize the physicochemical properties and biological activity in vitro of cur/\u03b1-toc-bicosomes. The influence of the concentrations of phospholipids and cholesterol in three cur/\u03b1-toc-bicosomes was studied. The cur/\u03b1-toc-bicosomes were characterized in\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 1912 3 of 19\nterms of particle size, polydispersity index (PDI), morphology, Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR), encapsulation efficiency (EE), loading capacity (LC), and lipid oxidation. Finally, the cur/\u03b1-toc-bicosomes were evaluated according to antioxidant, hemolytic, cell viability, and antifungal activity. This study provides a promising strategy to improve the solubility and the antioxidant effectiveness of cur and \u03b1-toc through a novel co-encapsulation skin delivery system. The proposed systems could be used for the topical treatment of diseases caused by oxidative damage or as dermal antifungal therapy."

Bicelles\nBicellar formulations were prepared by the thin-layer dispersion method, and concentrations were determined from preliminary experiments. Briefly, bicelles were formed with DPPC/DHPC at a 3.5:1 lipid molar ratio (q), cur (180 \u00b5M), and \u03b1-toc (600 \u00b5M). The mixture was dissolved in chloroform into a round-bottom flask. The chloroform was removed with a rotary evaporator (B\u00fcchi Rotavapor R-100, Flawil, Switzerland) at 40 \u25e6C; thin lipid films were formed on the flask walls. The dried lipid films were hydrated with distilled water to reach 6% w/v of total lipid concentration. Bicellar formulations were prepared by subjecting the sample to several cycles of sonication and freezing until the sample became transparent. Cur and \u03b1-toc-loaded bicelles were called cur/\u03b1-toc-bicelles. Different studies related to bicelles [29] and our own experience [19,20] indicate that DPPC/DHPC at q = 3.5:1 discoidal system is obtained easily and they remain stable. In addition, the total concentration of 6% is adequate to maintain the discoidal morphology of the bicelles, since lower concentration could induce the transformation of bicelles to vesicles [20].\n2.2.2. Bicosome Systems\nThe liposomal vesicles were prepared using Lipoid P-100/cholesterol in a ratio of 8:2 at different concentrations 6, 10, and 14% w/v. These concentrations were chosen to achieve the encapsulation of the bicelles while maintaining the fluidity of the final systems. Each mixture was dissolved in chloroform into a round-bottom flask. The chloroform was removed with a rotary evaporator at 40 \u25e6C. The film was hydrated with the cur/\u03b1-toc-bicelles (6% v/w) until bicosomes formed; these bicosomes were called cur/\u03b1-toc-bicosomes. Three cur/\u03b1-toc-bicosomes were prepared (BA, BB, and BC), reaching 12, 16 and 20% of total lipids, respectively. In general, the lipid concentration was high to favor the incorporation of the two studied molecules, cur and \u03b1-toc. Con-\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 1912 4 of 19\ntrol bicosomes were formed according to the same methods, without cur and \u03b1-toc. The cur/\u03b1-toc-bicosomes represent a novel encapsulation method that combines the advantages of both bicelles and liposomes. This approach aims to enhance solubility, increase entrapment efficiency, reduce lipid oxidation, and improve antioxidant activity.

In addition, FTIR spectroscopy suggested how antioxidants interact with lipids. Encapsulation efficiency (EE) and loading capacity (LC) reported on the ability of the systems as carriers of the molecules studied. These techniques are commonly employed in characterization studies of similar systems, enabling us to effectively compare our results with those of other studies.\n2.3.1. Determination of Particle Size and Polydispersity Index (PDI)\nThe particle size and PDI of the bicellar formulations and the cur/\u03b1-toc-bicosomes (BA, BB, and BC) were determined using a Zetasizer Nano ZS (HT series, Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK) at 25 \u25e6C. Conditions for measurement were defined according to Liu et al. [30]. The relative refractive index, i.e., the ratio of the refractive index of the phospholipids (1.490) to that of the dispersion medium (1.330), was 1.120. The absorption of the phospholipids was 0.001.\n2.3.2. Morphology\nThe morphology of the cur/\u03b1-toc-bicosomes was observed using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM, Zeiss LSM780, Jena, Germany) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM, Hitachi SU-3500, Tokyo, Japan). The sample (1 mL) was mixed with 40 \u00b5L of BODIPY\u00ae (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Molecular Probes\u2122) to stain the phospholipids. The mixed solution was placed on a concave confocal microscope slide. Images of the sample were acquired with a 100\u00d7 magnification lens. For the image acquisition in STEM, the cur/\u03b1-toc-bicosomes (1 mL) were incubated in 1% osmium tetroxide solution (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h at 4 \u25e6C. The excess of the solution was removed by centrifugation (5000\u00d7 g by 10 min).\n2.3.3. Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy\nThe chemical structure of lyophilized cur/\u03b1-toc-bicosomes, free cur, and free \u03b1-toc was monitored by FTIR spectroscopy using the Jasco FT-IR-4600 spectrophotometer (Jasco Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an attenuated total reflection (ATR) accessory that uses a ZnSe crystal at an angle of incidence of 45\u25e6 on a horizontal orientation. The spectra were collected in the wavenumber between 500 and 4500 cm\u22121. Scan speed was 20 scan/sec at a resolution of 16 cm\u22121 at 25 \u25e6C. Peaks obtained were identified, compared, and interpreted from reference spectra.\n2.3.4. Determination of Encapsulation Efficiency (EE) and Loading Capacity (LC)\nTo determine the percentage of cur/\u03b1-toc-bicosomes (BA, BB, and BC), 40 \u00b5L of each system was centrifuged at 12,000\u00d7 g for 30 min at 20 \u25e6C (Centurion Scientific Limited K2015R, Chichester, UK). The supernatant was discarded, and the precipitate was diluted\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 1912 5 of 19\nin a mixture of acetonitrile, methanol, and water (88/8/4 v/v/v).

At 12\u201323 min 50% (v/v) acetonitrile and 50% (v/v) methanol; at a 23\u201325 min transition to 47.5% (v/v) acetonitrile, 47.5% (v/v) water, and 5% (v/v) methanol; at 25\u201330 min, to 47.5% (v/v) acetonitrile, 47.5% (v/v) water, and 5% (v/v) methanol. Aliquots of 20 \u00b5L were analyzed at 425 and 292 nm to determine the cur and \u03b1-toc, respectively. The cur and \u03b1-toc peaks were obtained based on their retention time (9.6 and 22.5 min, respectively). Finally, cur and \u03b1-toc concentrations were calculated from standard curves obtained by reading the values of absorbance of solutions containing cur (0.5\u201350 ppm) with a R2 of 0.999 and \u03b1-toc (5\u2013100 ppm) with a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.999.

Particle Size and Polydispersity Index (PDI)\nThe hydrodynamic diameter and polydispersity index (PDI) of unloaded bicelles, cur/\u03b1-toc-bicelles, and cur/\u03b1-toc-bicosomes (BA, BB, and BC) were determined using dynamic light scattering. Typically, particle size analysis is performed based on the intensity (%) of scattered light. However, in the case of bicelles, their small size, discoidal shape, and particle motion pose challenges to accurate measurements. Moreover, in heterogeneous systems such as bicosomes (composed of bicelles and liposomes), larger and smaller particles contribute differently to the intensity of scattered light. Consequently, analyzing by intensity (%) can lead to an inflated proportion of larger particles. To address these limitations, we analyzed our results by volume (%) instead. The results are presented in Tables 2 and 3, providing a more accurate representation of the particle size in our study. Particle size by intensity (%) for cur/\u03b1-toc-bicosomes (BA, BB, and BC) is shown in Supplementary Table S1.\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 1912 8 of 19\nFigure 1.

Peak 1 exhibited particle sizes ranging from 31 to 60 nm, while peak 2 showed particle sizes ranging from 303 to 420 nm. The analysis by volume (%) revealed a higher proportion (\u226557%) of small particles (\u226460 nm) than large ones, indicating the predominant presence of small vesicles mainly in BB and BC. The particle sizes in peak 1 increased with increasing concentration of phosphatidylcholine (Lipoid P-100) and cholesterol. This could be due to an increase in the concentration of these lipids, promoting the formation of liposomal vesicles; therefore, more bicelles can be encapsulated in them. A lower number of bicelles outside the liposomal vesicle means the average particle size of peak 1 increases. Therefore, a particle size of 55\u201360 nm would correspond to a higher proportion of liposomal vesicles than bicelles. In addition, cur/\u03b1-toc-bicelles not encapsulated in liposomal vesicles could be transformed from disks to vesicles in the bicosome formation process. Rodriguez et al. [20] reported that dilution of bicosomes promoted the growth of structures, inducing the increase in particle size average. This could explain the behavior of peak 2, which increases in size when the concentration of lipids forming the liposomal vesicle decreases. The bimodal distribution of the bicosomes increases the PDI until it reaches a value of 1.0 as expected. Changes in the physical stability of cur/\u03b1-toc-bicosome (BC formulation) were determined by particle size (nm) initially and after 90 days storage at 4 \u25e6C (Supplementary Figure S2). The results showed no significant changes in particle size.\n3.1.2. Visual Appearance and Microscopic Structure\nThe visual appearance of the unloaded bicelles, cur/\u03b1-toc-bicelles, unloaded bicosomes, and cur/\u03b1-toc-bicosomes is shown in Figure 1a\u2013d. The unloaded bicelles and cur/\u03b1-toc-bicelles turn from colorless to yellow, acquiring the characteristic coloration of cur (Figure 1a,c). Additionally, the transparency in cur/\u03b1-toc-bicelles indicates that these are able to incorporate and solubilize both insoluble molecules in large amounts of water. The unloaded bicosomes and cur/\u03b1-toc-bicosomes correspond to formulations with a milky appearance (Figure 1b,d). In addition, no agglomeration, precipitation, or phase separation was observed in any of the systems prepared (bicelles and bicosomes). STEM and CLSM were used to provide further information about the size and morphology of the cur/\u03b1-toc-bicosomes (Figure 1e\u2013h). The bicosomes correspond to the spherical vesicles distributed throughout the image (Figure 1e). Two distributions of the particle size were observed vesicles around 200\u2013400 nm and a large number of nano-sized vesicles <100 nm which is highly consistent with the results of the average particle size measured by the dynamic light scattering system, which showed two main peaks in the formulations (Table 3). In addition, larger particles (>500 nm) originate from the aggregation or adhesion of vesicles, as can be seen in Figure 1f. Figure 1g shows the phospholipid bilayer (green), due to fluorescent dye BODIPY\u00ae, whereas Figure 1h shows the auto-fluorescence of cur (blue), which is located in the same places where the phospholipid bilayer is found, indicating that cur is within the phospholipid bilayer.\n3.1.3. Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR)\nFTIR spectroscopy was used to study the interaction between cur, \u03b1-toc, and the bicosomes (Figure 2). The characteristic peaks of cur can be found at 3503 cm\u22121, a representative peak of the phenolic O\u2013H group stretching vibrations. The peaks at 1627 and 1501 cm\u22121 are associated with the C=O and vibration of the benzene ring stretching respectively. The absorption peaks at 1271 and 1153 cm\u22121 are associated with aromatic C=O stretching and C\u2013O\u2013C group. The region between 959 and 809 cm\u22121 showed the cis and trans C\u2013H deformation vibration on the benzene ring. In the cur spectrum, there were no peaks in the most significant carbonyl region (1800\u20131650 cm\u22121), indicating that cur existed in the keto-enol tautomeric form [34].\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 1912 10 of 19Pharmaceutics 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 20\nOn the other hand, \u03b1-toc exhibited characteristic peaks at 3453 cm\u22121 (stretching \u2013OH), 2924, and 2862 cm\u22121 (asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of \u2013CH2 and \u2013CH3). The peak at 1453 cm\u22121 coincides with phenyl skeletal or methyl asymmetric bending, while 1370 cm\u22121 corresponds to methyl symmetric bending, 1247 cm\u22121 for \u2013CH2 stretching bending, and 1076 cm\u22121 for plane bending of phenyl and 922 cm\u22121 for trans =CH2 stretching [35]. The cur/\u03b1-toc-bicosomes exhibited combined peaks of the phospholipids and cholesterol. The two absorption peaks at 2921 and 2848 cm\u22121 are attributed to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibration of the C\u2013H bond in CH2, respectively. The peak at 1735 cm\u22121 represents the symmetric stretching vibration C=O group. In addition, the peaks at 1064 and 1247 cm\u22121 are related to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibration of PO2\u2212. The peak at 965 cm\u22121 corresponds to the asymmetric stretching vibration of N(CH3)3+ [36]. However, most of the characteristic peaks of cur and \u03b1-toc could not be found in the cur/\u03b1-toc-bicosomes. This result demonstrated that the characteristic peaks of cur and \u03b1toc merged or overlapped with the absorption bands of the lipid matrix. The above could occur because the lipid concentration used to prepare the bicosomes is higher than the concentration of cur/\u03b1-toc-loaded in them. However, Ng et al. [37] established the successful encapsulation of bioactive compounds of interest when the characteristic bands are not distinguishable in the complete encapsulation system.\n3.1.4. Encapsulation Efficiency (EE) and Loading Capacity (LC) Two important physicochemical parameters in the optimization of bicosomes are the EE and LC. The EE of the bicosomes represents the fraction of added cur and \u03b1-toc that ends up in the bicelles and liposomal vesicles. A high EE ensures the bioavailability of cur and \u03b1-toc. The contents of cur and \u03b1-toc encapsulated in the bicosomes (BA, BB, and BC) were measured as shown in Table 4. The interesting results of EE may occur for several reasons. The high hydrophobicity of the phospholipids was used to prepare the bicosomes, since cur and \u03b1-toc are stabilized within the hydrophobic region of the phospholipids. In the bicosomes, both cur and \u03b1-toc have a double possibility of encapsulation; for example, the antioxidant compounds that were not encapsulated in the phospholipid membrane of the bicelles can then be encapsulated in the phospholipid membrane of the liposomal vesicle.

On the other hand, by increasing the lipid percentage in the liposomal composition, more liposomal vesicles can be formed, increasing the encapsulation of cur/\u03b1-toc-bicelles and the EE of the bicosomes. Additionally, the increase in the lipid percentage in the liposomal composition may be directly related to the average vesicle size in the bicosomes (Table 3), as larger amounts of cur/\u03b1-toc-bicelles may be incorporated into larger liposomal vesicles possessing a larger internal diameter. In this case, BC > BB > BA reached 77 \u00b1 2%, 69 \u00b1 4%, and 56 \u00b1 5% of EE for cur, while for \u03b1-toc, the EE obtained was BC > BB > BA reaching 65 \u00b1 3%, 64 \u00b1 2%, and 58 \u00b1 8%, respectively.\nTable 4.

The differences in the EE between cur and \u03b1-toc could be attributed to differences in the molecular structure of both antioxidant compounds. Cur could be incorporated into the hydrophobic region more effectively because it has a lower molecular weight (368 g/mol) than \u03b1-toc (431 g/mol). In general, the EE reported for cur and \u03b1-toc in lipid systems is diverse and influenced by the nature of the encapsulating material, chemical properties, methodology used, and other reasons [38]. In addition, cur and \u03b1-toc are labile compounds; conditions such as light, temperature, and processing may also influence the result. The EE values in lipid systems have been reported in the range from 60% to 95% [39,40] for cur and from 10% to 90% for \u03b1-toc [5,41]. Thus, our results are in a highly acceptable range. The LC of the bicosomes corresponds to the fraction of the bicelles and liposomal vesicles comprised of cur and \u03b1-toc. The LC of cur/\u03b1-toc-bicosomes was analyzed as shown in Table 4. The highest LC was obtained by the BC formulation (67 \u00b1 2%) followed by BB and BA formulations (65 \u00b1 2% and 52 \u00b1 0.4%, respectively), which is consistent with the EE results."

Figure 3 shows the MDA equivalent content (\u00b5M/g) due to autoxidation of unloaded bicosomes and cur/\u03b1-toc-bicosomes (BA, BB, and BC). The results showed that the TBARS values for cur/\u03b1-toc-bicosomes (BA, BB, and BC) were lower than those of unloaded bicosomes. The MDA equivalent content (\u00b5M/g) values in the unloaded bicosomes increased with the increase in the total lipid percentages in the formulation BC > BB > BA, which reached 0.828 \u00b1 0.03, 0.810 \u00b1 0.01, and 0.532 \u00b1 0.01 MDA equivalent content (\u00b5M/g), respectively.

The cur/\u03b1-toc-bicosomes had higher cell viability than cur and \u03b1-toc free, which may be from the capability of bicosomes to enhance the bioavailability of cur and \u03b1-toc inside the cells.\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 15 of 20 3.4. Hemolysis and Cell Viability Assays The hemolytic and cell viability evaluation of delivery systems is becoming an im-\nportant issue nowadays, especially referring to lipid systems intended for pharmaceutical industrial application. A hemolysis test can be used as an index of hemocompatibility for materials intended for biological applications. None of the cur/\u03b1-toc-bicosomes (BA, BB, and BC) caused hemolysis (Table 4). According to ISO 10993-4, materials showing hemolysis values lower than 5% can be used as blood-contacting materials [50]. Thus, these results suggest that cur/\u03b1-toc-bicosomes had a good biosecurity and that hemocompatibility was not compromised by formulation components. Figure 5 shows the cell viability profiles of cur/\u03b1-toc-bicosomes (BA, BB, and BC) and free cur and \u03b1-toc solution in contact with fibroblast (3T3L1/CL-173\u2122) and keratinocyte (HaCaT) cells in an MTT assay after 24 h. Different concentrations of cur and \u03b1-toc in the range of 0.5\u201325 \u00b5M were evaluated. The results revealed that the viability of fibroblast cells (3T3L1/CL-173\u2122) was above 85% in the cur/\u03b1-toc-bicosomes (BA, BB, and BC) in the range of concentrations at 0.5\u201325 \u00b5M used for the study (Figure 5a). A decrease in cell viability was observed at 25 \u00b5M concentration of cur and \u03b1-toc free below 60%. The cur/\u03b1toc-bicosomes had higher cell viability than cur and \u03b1-toc free, which may be from the capability of bicosomes to enhance the bioavailability of cur and \u03b1-toc inside the cells.\nIn keratinocyte cells (HaCaT), the results revealed that the viability was \u226565% in the cur/\u03b1-toc-bicosomes used (BA, BB, and BC) in the range of concentrations at 0.5\u201325 \u00b5M used for the study (Figure 5b). Keratinocyte cells are more sensitive to contact with cur/\u03b1toc-bicosomes (BA, BB, and BC) than to contact with free cur and \u03b1-toc at concentrations of 0.5, 5, and 10 \u00b5M; however, a significant decrease in cell viability (%) is observed using free cur and \u03b1-toc at concentrations of 25 \u00b5M, reaching only 34% cell viability.\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 1912 15 of 19\nSince statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) were detected among the bicosomes at the same dose. It can be concluded that the total lipid percentage (12, 16, and 20% w/v) used to prepare the cur/\u03b1-toc-bicosomes had a negative impact on the biocompatibility of the formulations in fibroblast and keratinocyte cells. Additionally, for the cur/\u03b1-tocbicosomes, the pattern of cell viability behavior (%) is the same in all concentrations, ordered as follows: BA > BB > BC. On the other hand, for fibroblast and keratinocyte cells, the IC50 values for free cur and \u03b1-toc and cur/\u03b1-toc-bicosomes are greater than 25 \u00b5M, except for free cur and \u03b1-toc, where the IC50 value is between 10 and 25 \u00b5M in keratinocyte cells. Our results are comparable to those of Lundvig et al. [51], who reported an apoptotic response in HaCaT cells induced by high doses of cur (\u226530 \u00b5M). Caddeo et al. [5] demonstrated that \u03b1-toc-loaded transfersomes (vesicles prepared with phosphatidylcholine and different polysorbates) showed no toxic effect in HaCaT cells; however, a dose-dependent decrease in viability (from ~95% to 75%) was observed in fibroblast cells. Several studies support the topical application of cur and \u03b1-toc-loaded delivery systems for wound healing. In addition, in vivo and ex vivo studies using \u03b1-toc-loaded nanoemulsions confirm the proliferative effect both in keratinocyte cells, fibroblast cells, and in human skin biopsies [52]. The interactions between keratinocyte and fibroblast cells are crucial for the proper execution of the wound repair phase [51]. Our results are a starting point for future ex vivo skin studies using cur/\u03b1-toc-bicosomes, which could have potential application in the treatment of wounds or skin and/or mucosal ulcerations based on formulation characteristics."

The highest antifungal activity (76 \u00b1 2%) was observed in cur/\u03b1-tocbicelles at a 50:50 v/v ratio. On the other hand, when increasing the total lipid percentage in the cur/\u03b1-toc-bicosomes (BA, BB, and BC), the growth of C. albicans also increases, reducing the antifungal activity. Inhibition values obtained were 68 \u00b1 1%, 52 \u00b1 6%, and 33 \u00b1 10% for the BA, BB, and BC formulations, respectively; this may occur because the liposomal vesicle surrounding the bicelles in the BA, BB, and BC formulations makes the antioxidant molecules loaded in the systems less available. The BC formulation has the highest lipid concentration in its composition (20% total lipid), which could make the interaction between cur and C. albicans less accessible. The antifungal effect of both free and encapsulated cur in different systems against C. albicans has been reported by several authors [53\u201355]. Shahzad et al. [56] established that the inhibition of C. albicans in the presence of cur is due to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) toxic to the fungus and suppression of hyphal development. On the other hand, Xie et al. [57] substantiated that the result of encapsulation produces a gradual release of cur that destroys the cell membrane of C. albicans, increasing permeability, which generates a change in the internal environment of the fungus, thereby inhibiting its growth. Both cur/\u03b1-toc-bicelles and cur/\u03b1-toc-bicosomes (BA, BB, and BC) are shown to reduce the growth of C. albicans in a 50:50 v/v ratio (inoculum:formulation); however, further studies are needed to demonstrate that our cur/\u03b1-toc-bicosomes can be used to treat diseases produced, for example, in mucosal tissue by the presence of C. albicans.\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 1912 16 of 19Pharmaceutics 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 17 of 20\n\u2731\n\u2731\u2731\u2731\n\u2731\u2731\u2731\u2731\n\u2731\u2731\n\u2731\u2731\u2731\u2731\n\u2731\u2731\nFigure 6.

Conclusions In the present study, we successfully prepared cur/\u03b1-toc-bicelles using DPPC, DHPC, cur, and \u03b1-toc. These bicelles were then encapsulated within liposomal vesicles composed of phosphatidylcholine (Lipoid P-100) and cholesterol, resulting in the formulation known as cur/toc-bicosome. Cur/\u03b1-toc-bicosomes represent a novel co-encapsulation approach that combines the inherent characteristics of liposomes with the versatility and applicability of bicelles, resulting in a unique and multifunctional nanostructure. Our results indicate that during the first step of encapsulation, bicelles significantly enhance the solubility of cur and \u03b1-toc when incorporated between the phospholipid bilayers. Furthermore, all prepared bicosomes exhibited high-entrapment efficiency for cur (56\u201377%) and \u03b1-toc (51\u2013 65%), varying based on the percentage of total lipids incorporated in the formulation. Moreover, cur/\u03b1-toc-bicosomes exhibited reduced lipid oxidation and increased antioxidant activity compared to unloaded bicosomes, suggesting a synergistic effect between cur, \u03b1-toc, and the phospholipids employed. Additionally, the formulations demonstrated good hemocompatibility, favorable biocompatibility in fibroblast and keratinocyte cell lines, and exhibited efficacy in inhibiting the growth of C. albicans. These findings suggest that the synergistic combination of two delivery systems (bicelles and liposomes) and two antioxidant compounds (cur and \u03b1-toc) could be effective systems for treating dermal diseases resulting from oxidative damage, such as psoriasis and ulcerations of the oral cavity caused by radiotherapy treatments. In addition, the external liposome protects the bicelle against dilution conditions, as occurs in environments with high water content. Therefore, the developed system may serve as a suitable delivery system for administration routes such as oral transmucosal. On the other hand, the potential capacity of cur/\u03b1-toc bicosomes to counteract dermal infections caused by C. albicans expands and diversifies their utility towards antifungal treatment, wound healing, cosmetics, and skincare.
