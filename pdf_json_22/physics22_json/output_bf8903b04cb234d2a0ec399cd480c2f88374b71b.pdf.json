Detecting SGWBs provides us with invaluable information about astrophysics, cosmology, and fundamental physics. In this paper, we study SGWBs from binary black-hole (BBH) and binary neutron-star (BNS) coalescences in a network of next-generation ground-based GW observatories (Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope) and determine how well they can be measured; this then limits how well we can observe other subdominant astrophysical and cosmological SGWBs. We simulate all-Universe populations of BBHs and BNSs and calculate the corresponding SGWBs, which consist of a superposition of (i) undetected signals, and (ii) the residual background from imperfect removal of resolved sources. The sum of the two components sets the sensitivity for observing other SGWBs. Our results show that, even with next-generation observatories, the residual background is large and limits the sensitivity to other SGWBs. The main contributions to the residual background arise from uncertainties in inferring the coalescence phase and luminosity distance of the detected signals. Alternative approaches to signal subtraction would need to be explored to minimize the BBH and BNS foreground in order to observe SGWBs from other subdominant astrophysical and cosmological sources.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe first detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from a binary black-hole (BBH) coalescence in 2015 has opened a new window to the Universe [1]. Soon after that, the first detection of GWs from a binary neutron-star (BNS) coalescence [2] and the observation of its electromagnetic counterpart [3, 4] have significantly advanced the field of multimessenger astronomy. So far, nearly 100 BBHs and 2 BNSs have been detected [5\u20137]. These observations have made crucial contributions to astrophysics, cosmology, and fundamental physics [8\u201310].\nIn addition to those loud and individually resolved GW events, a plethora of signals from multiple kinds of sources remain too weak to be detected, and their incoherent superposition gives rise to stochastic GW backgrounds (SGWBs) [11\u201315]. A huge variety of SGWBs are expected. Some are of astrophysical origin, such as those from supernova explosions [16\u201320] or the cumulative sum of unresolved compact-binary coalescences (CBCs) [21\u2013 26]. Others are of cosmological origin and include SGWBs from standard inflation [27\u201329], axion inflation [30], cosmic strings [31\u201334], etcetera. The predicted energy densities of these different SGWBs vary by many orders of magnitude.\nThe detection and characterization of SGWBs has important scientific payoffs. Astrophysical backgrounds potentially contain key information about the mass and redshift distributions and other properties of their corresponding sources [9, 35, 36]. In addition, observing\ncosmological SGWBs would open up a unique window to the earliest moments of the Universe and to the physical laws that apply at the highest energy (up to the limits of the Planck scale) [27\u201334]. The current secondgeneration detector network (i.e., advanced LIGO [37, 38], advanced Virgo [39], and KAGRA [40]) did not detect any SGWB in their searches [41], putting upper bounds on the amplitude of the energy spectrum in various frequency bands [9, 41]. The SGWB for current detectors is projected to be dominated by the CBC background, as their network sensitivity allows only a small fraction of them to be resolved and subtracted. Therefore, detection of the subdominant astrophysical and cosmological SGWBs cannot be accomplished.\nThe situation could be significantly improved in nextgeneration (XG) observatories, including Cosmic Explorer (CE) [42] and the Einstein Telescope (ET) [43]. They are expected to detect hundreds of thousands of BBHs and BNSs per year at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) larger than 12 (this is the standard SNR threshold used by LIGO and Virgo, although the optimal choice may be different for XG detectors [44\u201346]). Meanwhile, the individually resolvable sources will be much better measured, and thus more precisely subtracted as a foreground.\nIn this work, we study the CBC background in XG ground-based GW observatories. We consider populations of BNSs and BBHs with local merger rates consistent with the latest LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) catalog [5, 9]. We study how well the individually resolvable events can be measured and subtracted, and how much the unavoidable\nar X\niv :2\n20 9.\n01 31\n0v 2\n[ gr\n-q c]\n2 4\nSe p\n20 23\n2 contribution from imperfect subtraction (\u2126err) contributes to the remaining SGWBs of CBCs. The other contribution is from the superposition of unresolved CBC GW signals (\u2126unres). The sum of these two residual backgrounds sets the effectivity sensitivity and determines how well other subdominant SGWBs can be detected. It is thus essential to understand these backgrounds and to think about how they can be minimized. In this paper we estimate the optimal signal-to-noise ratio threshold at which the sum \u2126unres +\u2126err is minimized for BBH and BNS populations, respectively.\nTo our knowledge, the problem of subtracting the CBC foreground from resolved sources to detect subdominant SGWBs was first studied in detail in the context of the Big Bang Observer (BBO), a space-based interferometer network concept to observe primordial GWs [47, 48]. After the detection of GW150914, various authors considered the possibility that BBHs may contribute to the confusion noise for the space-based detector LISA [49] and possible methods for their subtraction [50]. More recent studies have applied an information-matrix formalism to the case of XG observatories [51, 52]. Here (and in the companion paper [53]) we build upon the prior work of Refs. [51, 52] by expanding the range of binary parameters assumed to be determined for each GW signal. While those studies focused on the effect of the three dominant phase parameters (the redshifted detector-frame chirp mass Mz, coalescence phase \u03d5c, and time of coalescence tc), we consider the larger 9-dimensional parameter space characterizing nonspinning binaries. We find that correlations and degeneracies between different parameters, and in particular the uncertainty in the amplitude of the individual signals, result in a much larger value for \u2126err.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we present the assumptions on the mass and redshift distributions and local merger rates that underlie our simulation of BBH and BNS coalescence events. In Sec. III, we detail the formalism and assumptions (on waveform models, detector networks, and parameter estimation) that we use to compute SGWBs, and in particular \u2126unres and \u2126err. In Sec. IV we present our results, and in Sec. V we discuss their implications and possible directions for future work.\nThroughout this paper G is the gravitational constant, c the speed of light, H0 the Hubble constant, and we use the \u039bCDM cosmological model with cosmological parameters taken from Planck 2018 [54]."

However, this method is impractical because of the size of our sample (we typically have N \u223c 105).\nWe thus provide an estimate of the errors by adopting the linear signal approximation [78].

Compared to their work, our choice results in more realistic estimates of the statistical errors.\nIn XG detectors, longer signals (e.g., close-by BNSs) are expected to overlap. The overlap has two main effects. In searches for GW signals, the presence of overlapping signals might cause some of them to be missed. Reference [79] estimates that this will reduce the redshift reach by 8% for ET, and by 15% for CE. In parameter estimation, it may be challenging to infer the parameters of multiple coincident signals simultaneously [80\u201383]. Furthermore, multiple weak overlapping signals can produce a \u201cconfusion noise\u201d contribution that must be added to instrumental noise, increasing the uncertainties on the recovered parameters of loud signals [84, 85]. Both effects (reduced redshift reach and larger parameter estimation errors) increase \u2126unres +\u2126err compared to our estimates, which therefore can be considered conservative."

We assume all the CE detectors to be in the latest phase of their development and optimized at low frequencies, i.e., we select the CE2 and the CBO option in GWBENCH [77]. Here CE2 stands for the final stage of CE detectors (in contrast to CE1, which means the initial stage) and CBO stands for \u201ccompact-binary optimizations\u201d (in contrast to PMO, which means \u201cpost-merger optimizations\u201d). For ET, we consider its most up-to-date triangular configuration with ET-D sensitivity [43].\nWe set the minimum frequency in our calculations to be 3 Hz, which is consistent with the PSDs of the detectors in our networks (Fig. 1). Regarding the final frequency, we use 2048 Hz. This is larger than the frequency at the innermost stable circular orbit [93] for most of the sources in our catalog, and the detector noise makes contributions above this maximum frequency negligible [44].\nWe include Earth-rotation effects for BNSs and neglect them for BBHs. This is because GW signals from BBHs last only a few minutes in the detector frame [81], during which the change in the detectors\u2019 response [94] is small, so the effect on their SNR and parameter estimation is negligible [44]. For BNSs, on the contrary, the signals last up to several hours [81], and hence the change of the detectors\u2019 response must be taken into account [44]."

            "text": "In this section, we present and discuss our results. We mainly focus on our fiducial 3-detector network. We usually compare our fiducial waveform model IMRPhenomD to the older model IMRPhenomC as a simple way to quantify waveform modeling uncertainties.\nFigure 2 shows \u2126tot, \u2126unres, and \u2126err for BBHs and BNSs, computed using different values of SNRthr (as indicated in the legend) and the two waveform models. For BBHs, the whole signal (inspiral, merger, and ringdown) can be observed in the frequency range of interest. For BNSs, by contrast, the inspiral phase dominates. In both cases, we recover the expected inspiral behavior at low frequencies, where \u2126tot \u221d \u2126unres \u221d f2/3 [95].\nFor all the panels in Fig. 2, as we increase SNRthr the number of unresolved CBC events increases, and so does \u2126unres. On the contrary, \u2126err decreases with growing SNRthr, because the number of resolved CBC events decreases and the events with larger SNRs have smaller parameter estimation errors.\nBy comparing the left and right panels we see that the difference between IMRPhenomD and IMRPhenomC is visible but small, especially for BBHs. The difference between \u2126err for PhenomD and PhenomC becomes more noticeable as SNRthr grows, because differences between waveforms dominate over statistical errors for large-SNR signals.\nFigure 3 shows the fraction of resolved events as a function of SNRthr. For BBHs, 99%, 53%, and 20% of the total events are resolved above SNRthr = 8, 40, and 80, respectively. Resolving BNSs is harder: only 29%, 8%, and 1% of the total events are resolved above SNRthr = 12, 20, and 40, respectively. These numbers do not depend on the waveform model.\nFor small values of SNRthr (8 or 12) most events are detected, so the unresolved contribution to the background is small, in the sense that \u2126unres \u226a \u2126err and \u2126unres \u226a \u2126tot. On the contrary, for large SNRthr (say, SNRthr = 80 for BBHs), \u2126err and \u2126unres become comparable and overwhelm the detectors\u2019 sensitivity. As we increase SNRthr, \u2126unres + \u2126err first decreases and then increases. If we want to search for SGWBs of cosmological origin or for subdominant astrophysical SGWBs, our goal is to minimize \u2126unres +\u2126err. This happens at some optimal value of SNRthr that we wish to determine.\nFigure 4 shows our frequency-dependent, minimized \u2126unres + \u2126err for the two subpopulations of BBHs and BNSs (upper panel), as well as the corresponding optimal SNRthr, which in general is also a function of frequency (lower panel). It is clear from this plot that the optimal SNRthr is nearly constant below hundreds of Hz, with only small fluctuations. This is because \u2126unres + \u2126err varies very slowly with SNRthr, especially near the optimal SNRthr. Above hundreds of Hz, where merger and ringdown dominate, the optimal SNRthr increases. This effect is more prominent for BBHs, whose energy density drops rapidly in this frequency range.\nThe mild variability of SNRthr with frequency means that we can compute \u2126unres + \u2126err using a frequencyindependent optimal SNRthr. We choose this optimal SNRthr to be 10 (20) for BBHs (BNSs) when we consider the IMRPhenomD model, and 12 (42) for BBHs (BNSs) when we work with the IMRPhenomC model. These values are chosen to match the frequency-dependent optimal\n8 10 13 10 12 10 11 10 10 10 9 G W BBH tot BNS tot IMRPhenomD BBH minimal unres + err BNS minimal unres + err BBH unres + err, SNRthr=10 BNS unres + err, SNRthr=20\n101 102 103\nf [ Hz ]\n0 20 40 60 O pt im al S N\nR th\nr\nBBH optimal SNRthr BNS optimal SNRthr\n10 13\n10 12\n10 11\n10 10\n10 9\nG W\nBBH tot\nBNS tot\nIMRPhenomC\nBBH minimal unres + err BNS minimal unres + err BBH unres + err, SNRthr=12 BNS unres + err, SNRthr=42\n101 102 103\nf [ Hz ]\n0 20 40 60 O pt im al S N\nR th\nr\nBBH optimal SNRthr BNS optimal SNRthr\nFIG. 4.

We also plot \u2126unres + \u2126err for BBHs and BNSs computed by choosing the frequency-independent optimal SNRthr that matches the results in the lower panel (dashed lines in the upper panels): the results are almost indistinguishable from the solid lines. For comparison, in the upper panels we also plot the total energy density \u2126tot for BBHs and BNSs (dash-dotted lines). All results refer to our fiducial 3-detector network.\nSNRthr computed in the lower panel. The dashed lines in the upper panel of Fig. 4 show that the minimal \u2126unres +\n\u2126err computed using a frequency-independent optimal SNRthr is nearly identical to the value computed using a frequency-dependent detection threshold. This is very convenient from an experimental point of view. In the rest of this section we will compute \u2126unres +\u2126err using a frequency-independent optimal SNRthr.\nFigure 5 clarifies why the optimal SNRthr is so different for the two waveform models in the BNS case, while it\u2019s not for BBHs. The main effect of a changing SNRthr is to uniformly shift \u2126unres and \u2126err up or down at any given frequency, so (for concreteness) in Fig. 5 we evaluate all backgrounds at a single frequency (f = 100 Hz), and we plot them as functions of SNRthr for different waveform models. The choice of waveform model does not affect \u2126unres (compare Fig. 3), but it does affect \u2126err. In particular, the BNS estimates for \u2126err evaluated using IMRPhenomD and IMRPhenomC are remarkably different. This difference increases at large values of SNRthr, as expected, because systematic errors dominate over statistical uncertainties in this regime. The large variation in \u2126err for BNSs explains why the optimal SNRthr that minimizes the sum \u2126unres + \u2126err can vary by as much as a factor of order 2, from 20 (for BNS backgrounds computed using IMRPhenomD) to 42 (for BNS backgrounds computed using IMRPhenomC). The larger difference in \u2126err for BNSs must lie in the differences in how IMRPhenomC and IMRPhenomD treat the inspiral part of the signal, because BNS signals are inspiral-\n9 101 102 103\nf [ Hz ]\n10 14\n10 13\n10 12\n10 11\n10 10 10 9 G W\nBBH err , 9 pars\nBNS unre s BNS err , 9 pars\nBBH unr es BBH err , 3 pars BNS err , 3 pars\nIMRPhenomD\n101 102 103\nf [ Hz ]\n10 14\n10 13\n10 12\n10 11\n10 10\n10 9\nG W\nBBH err , 9 pars\nBNS unre s BNS err , 9 pars\nBBH unres BBH err , 3 pars\nBNS err, 3 pars\nIMRPhenomC\nFIG. 6. Unresolved background \u2126unres (dotted lines) and error contributions to the background \u2126err (solid lines) computed using both our 9-parameter recovery (\u201c9 pars\u201d) and the 3-parameter recovery (including only Mz, tc, and \u03d5c) considered in previous work [52] (\u201c3 pars\u201d). All backgrounds are computed at the frequency-independent optimal SNRthr for the 9-parameter case: 10 (for BBHs) and 20 (for BNSs) in the left panel; 12 (for BBHs) and 42 (for BNSs) in the right panel. The shaded band around the 9-parameter \u2126err shows astrophysical uncertainties on the rates. The worsening in \u2126err due to including 9 parameters instead of 3 is quite dramatic and it is larger than astrophysical uncertainties, especially for BBHs.\ndominated. In both models, the inspiral phase in the frequency domain is modeled using a post-Newtonian (PN) expansion, i.e. Taylorf2 [96, 97], plus higher-order corrections tuned to inspiral-merger-ringdown (IMR) hybrids [90, 91]. However, in IMRPhenomC the Taylorf2 model is also used for the inspiral phase of the IMR hybrids, while in IMRPhenomD the inspiral phase of the IMR hybrids is constructed with an effective-one-body model, SEOBNRv2 [98]. Further uncertainties related to waveform systematics may be caused by the inclusion of additional PN terms, such as tidal deformations. Note that uncertainties due to waveform systematics are subdominant compared to other uncertainties (e.g., on the local merger rates) considered here. A thorough analysis of waveform systematics is beyond the scope of this paper.\nFigure 6 shows \u2126unres and \u2126err for BBHs and BNSs computed at the optimal SNRthr with the two waveform models. For \u2126err, we show the comparison between our calculation, in which we include 9 parameters, and the 3-parameter estimate of \u2126err (which included only Mz, tc, \u03d5c) considered in previous work [52]. Our 3-parameter estimate of \u2126err is similar in amplitude and functional form to the results of Ref. [52]: in fact, we checked that we can recover their results if we use the same value of SNRthr and the same population model. The difference between the residual backgrounds \u2126err computed using our full 9-parameter recovery and those computed using the 3-parameter recovery of Ref. [52] is quite striking. The 9-parameter estimate of \u2126err is 2\u20133 orders of magnitude larger than the 3-parameter estimate of \u2126err at the same SNRthr. As we elaborate below, there are two reasons for this difference. One is quite obvious: as we increase the number of parameters, correlations and degeneracies\nbetween different parameters significantly increase the spread of the posteriors, and therefore the typical deviations of the recovered parameters from their true values become much larger. The second reason is not so obvious: some of the parameters that were not included in Ref. [52] affect directly the estimate of the signal\u2019s amplitude, and signals with poorly known amplitude have a large impact on the removal of the foreground.\nThe shaded bands in Fig. 6 show the impact of astrophysical uncertainties on the local merger rates (note that this is a lower bound on astrophysical uncertainties, because the redshift evolution of the rates is even more poorly constrained). It is difficult to formulate reliable predictions for the CBC SGWB, especially for BNSs, where the background can vary by about two orders of magnitude. However, the increase in \u2126err due to the addition of the amplitude parameters is even larger than the variability of the background due to the uncertain merger rates. There is a clearly visible difference in the residual background \u2126err predicted by the two waveform models, which is larger for BNSs than for BBHs. This difference, while small compared to current astrophysical uncertainties, highlights the importance of waveform systematics in data analysis and it will play a more prominent role in SGWB forecasts in the coming years, as new detections will steadily reduce the uncertainties in merger rates.\nWe can better understand why the 9-parameter estimate of \u2126err is so much larger than the 3-parameter estimate by identifying which parameters have large uncertainties, and therefore can give a large contribution to \u2126err even when SNRthr is large. To compute the contribution to \u2126err due to each parameter, we evaluate Eq. (11) by using the recovered value of that parameter only in \u03b8irec,\n10\nwhile we use the \u201ctrue\u201d values for all other parameters. We perform this calculation on each of the parameters in Eq. (15), with three exceptions: \u03b1, \u03b4, and \u03c8. The reason is that these three parameters do not affect the waveform polarizations (hence the energy flux and \u2126), but only the detectors\u2019 response (hence the SNR and the information matrix). However, they have a very important indirect impact on \u2126err through their correlations with the other six parameters.\nFigure 7 shows the results for BBHs (left) and BNSs (right), using either IMRPhenomD (top) or IMRPhenomC (bottom). In each of the panels, we compute the errors at the optimal value of SNRthr. One common feature of all panels is that large contributions to the uncertainty at nearly all frequencies arise from \u03d5c and DL, with \u03d5c generally yielding the dominant contribution. The dominance of the error on \u03d5c is mostly caused by its degeneracy with the polarization angle \u03c8, as both parameters contribute to an overall phase term in the detector response (see e.g. [99, 100]). The degeneracy is more severe for nearly\nface-on/face-off binaries, because for these binaries a rotation about the line of sight is identical to a shift in the orbital phase [100, 101]. These systems also generate louder signals, meaning that detected sources tend to be preferentially close to face-on/face-off binaries [102, 103]. The luminosity distance is highly degenerate with the inclination \u03b9, since both parameters appear only in the amplitudes of the waveform polarizations at leading order (see, e.g., Refs. [101, 104]). In order to break this degeneracy, one would need to determine the two amplitudes of the + and \u00d7 polarizations independently, but the difference between these two amplitudes is quite small for most binary systems [105]. In fact, various studies in the literature have shown that the luminosity distance remains poorly constrained for a significant subset of highredshift, low-SNR sources, even with a network of XG detectors [44\u201346].\nIn principle, these degeneracies can be broken or at least reduced by adopting waveform models that include higher harmonics [106\u2013110]. However, contributions from higher\n11\nharmonics are expected to be significant only for binaries whose components have fairly different masses [111], while the majority of the systems in our catalogs are nearly equal mass. We do not expect the inclusion of higher modes to significantly reduce \u2126err (especially in the BNS case), and we leave a more detailed exploration of higher harmonics to future work.\nThe main take-home message of this discussion is that including the contribution of parameters that affect the waveform amplitudes (such as \u03b9 and DL) and the antenna patterns (such as \u03b1, \u03b4 and \u03c8) is crucial to understand whether we can remove compact binary foregrounds.\nInterestingly, the two waveform models IMRPhenomD and IMRPhenomC show large differences in the contribution from the two mass parameters (Mz and \u03b7) to \u2126err. In particular, the Mz contribution to \u2126err is mostly negligible at all frequencies for IMRPhenomC, while it becomes even larger than the contribution from the luminosity distance for IMRPhenomD. Careful scrutiny shows that this is not due to differences in the information matrices, which are similar for the two waveform models. The effect is more subtle, and related to waveform systematics: small perturbations in Mz and \u03b7 in the two models are different, and their effect piles up when we consider the whole population. We have tested this observation by using exactly the same information matrices to sample \u03b8irec in Eq. (11): even in this case we get different results for IMRPhenomD and IMRPhenomC, which are qualitatively similar to the results shown in Fig. 7. The contributions due to the Mz and \u03b7 parameters are always subdominant compared to other parameters (in particular the coalescence phase), and therefore these differences have a small impact on the overall estimate of \u2126err, but they do highlight the fact that waveform systematics will play an important role in the data analysis of large populations in the XG detector era.\nWhile the effect of waveform systematics is important, its effect on the estimate of \u2126unres + \u2126err is currently\ndwarfed by astrophysical rate uncertainties (Sec. II C). Figure 8 compares the uncertainties of our calculated minimal \u2126unres+\u2126err due to the two different waveform models with astrophysical rate uncertainties for BBHs (left panel), BNSs (central panel), and their sum (right panel). The uncertainty band in each panel is shown for IMRPhenomD only (IMRPhenomC has the same relative uncertainty). The difference between the two waveform models is negligible compared to astrophysical rate uncertainties, the only exception being BBHs at the highest frequencies, where the energy density is low and the merger-ringdown part of the waveform dominates the signal. By looking at the total \u2126unres+\u2126err found by adding BBHs and BNSs (right panel) we see that BBHs dominate below \u2243 400 Hz, while BNSs dominate at higher frequencies.\nFigure 9 shows the sum of the (minimized) \u2126unres+\u2126err contributions from BBHs and BNSs for different waveform models and detector networks. The grey band shows the 90% confidence level due to astrophysical uncertainties in our fiducial case (IMRPhenomD and a 3-detector network). We overplot the sensitivities of 3-detector and 5-detector networks to SGWBs, computed in the absence of foregrounds from CBCs and other sources, assuming the data is integrated for one year. We also show the energy densities of SGWBs from other possible sources [52], including: (i) axion inflation [30], (ii) post-inflation oscillations of a fluid with an equation of state stiffer than radiation [112], (iii) a network of cosmic strings [31\u201334], (iv) the most optimistic prediction from cosmic supernovae throughout the Universe [20], and (v) post-inflation preheating models aided by parametric resonance [113\u2013116]. Note that the energy densities of these sources are model dependent, and they could be larger or smaller depending on the choice of model parameters.\nIn summary, subtracting the SGWB foreground from BBHs and BNSs is much harder than previously estimated. As shown in Fig. 4 for our fiducial case of a 3-detector network and IMRPhenomD, the BBH background subtrac-\n12\ntion only reduces it by a factor of 2\u20133. Crucially, the remaining background still overwhelms the BNS background at frequencies below \u223c 100 Hz. Similarly, the BNS background subtraction only reduces it by a factor of \u2272 2."

            "text": "The recent detections of nearly 100 individual CBC events (one with electromagnetic counterpart) have given us important information about astrophysics, cosmology, and fundamental physics. Future observations of SGWBs, which are the superposition of many individually unresolvable events (either astrophysical or cosmological in nature), also carry invaluable physical information. In the current (second-generation) detectors, BBHs and BNSs dominate, making it hard to observe astrophysical or cosmological SGWBs. More sensitive XG detectors will allow us to detect many more individual BBHs and BNSs, and to better measure their parameters. The question we ad-\ndress in this paper is whether these individual signals can be characterized and subtracted well enough to observe other, subdominant SGWBs.\nWe simulate BBH and BNS populations based on our current best estimates of their mass and redshift distributions and locally measured merger rates, making reasonable assumptions for the other parameters (see Table I). We find that the minimum \u2126unres +\u2126err for BBHs or BNSs is reached at an optimal SNR threshold SNRthr, which can be taken to be frequency independent. For BBHs, we estimate an optimal SNRthr of 10 for our fiducial waveform model IMRPhenomD and 12 for IMRPhenomC in our fiducial 3-detector network. For BNSs, we estimate an optimal SNRthr of 20 for IMRPhenomD and 42 for IMRPhenomC.3 The difference between the two waveform models, while important, is always much smaller than current astrophysical rate uncertainties, with the only exception of BBHs at high frequencies, where the energy density is low and details of the merger/ringdown waveform make a difference. More realistic estimates should also include the NS-BH binary population. Note that the distinction between BBH, BNS and NS-BH systems is blurred by parameter estimation errors on the component masses, and for data analysis purposes it may be more practical to consider all three CBC populations at the same time.\nOne of our main findings is that the minimized value of \u2126unres+\u2126err in XG detector networks is much larger than previous estimates. By computing the contribution to \u2126err from each parameter, we can determine which parameters dominate \u2126err. We find that the uncertainty in the coalescence phase \u03d5c dominates for nearly all frequencies, due to its degeneracy with the polarization angle \u03c8. Another important contribution comes from the luminosity distance DL, due to its degeneracy with the inclination angle cos \u03b9. We find large differences in the contribution from Mz and \u03b7 between IMRPhenomD and IMRPhenomC. These differences reflect waveform modeling systematics to some extent, but they do not affect too much our estimate of \u2126err, which is comparable in the two models because \u03d5c dominates.\nFor our fiducial 3-detector network, the minimized \u2126unres + \u2126err for BBHs is only a factor of 2\u20133 smaller than the total BBH SGWB, and it still overwhelms the background from BNSs below \u223c 100 Hz. For BNSs, the minimized \u2126unres+\u2126err is more than half of the total BNS background. As shown in Fig. 9, even for the optimistic 5-detector network, the BBH and BNS subtraction can only be improved by a factor of < 2 compared to the 3-detector network. This large residual makes it difficult to look for other SGWB sources.\nIn conclusion, subtracting the SGWB from BBHs and BNSs may be harder than anticipated. We hope that this will stimulate further work on data analysis techniques.\n3 In our optimistic 5-detector network and for IMRPhenomD, the corresponding values are 6 for BBHs and 20 for BNSs.\n13\nThe residuals due to imperfect removal could be reduced by subtracting the component tangent to the signal manifold at the point of best fit. This approach has been first proposed by Ref. [47, 117], although more detailed investigations are needed to understand the extent of this reduction when applied to realistic astrophysical catalogs. Other possibilities include notching in the time-frequency plane [118], using Bayesian techniques to estimate the foreground and background signal parameters simultaneously [119], adopting a principal-component analysis to extract subdominant SGWBs [50], or exploiting the design topology of ET to construct a null stream [120] that will help in understanding the foreground of CBC events [121]. One could also take advantage of the temporal and positional information of each event for a more precise subtraction.\nThe exceptional scientific payoff of a future detection of astrophysical and cosmological SGWBs motivates enduring efforts in the characterization of CBC SGWBs and further work on data analysis methods for their subtraction."

            "text": "In this Appendix, we briefly summarize the formalism adopted to estimate the network sensitivity curve shown\nas a reference in Fig. 8. We also compute the overlap reduction functions (ORFs) for the fiducial locations and orientations of the CE detectors adopted in GWBENCH [77]. We mostly follow Ref. [123] for the definition of sensitivity curves, and Refs. [11, 124] for the calculation of the ORFs.\nSearches for SGWBs in instrumental noise are conducted by cross-correlating the outputs of multiple GW detectors (see e.g. [41]). The optimal SNR for an unpolarized, isotropic SGWB in a network of Ndet interferometers with PSDs Sn,i(f), Sn,j(f) is given by [95, 123]\nSNRb = 3H20 10\u03c02 2T \u222b \u221e 0 df Ndet\u2211 i=1 Ndet\u2211 j>i \u03b32ij(f)\u2126 2 GW(f) f6Sn,i(f)Sn,j(f) 1/2 . (A1) Here T is the observing time and \u03b3ij(f) is the ORF [11, 124], a dimensionless function of frequency that accounts for the reduction in sensitivity due to the different positions and orientations of the detectors in the network. Explicitly, the ORF between the ith and jth detector in the network is defined as [11, 124]:\n\u03b3ij(f) = 5\n8\u03c0 \u2211 A \u222b S2 d\u2126\u0302FAi (\u2126\u0302)F A j (\u2126\u0302)e i2\u03c0\u2126\u0302\u00b7\u2206x , (A2)\nwhere \u2126\u0302 is a unit vector specifying the direction on a sphere, \u2206x the separation vector between the two detector sites, and FAi (\u2126\u0302), FAj (\u2126\u0302) are the response functions of the two detectors i, j to the A = +,\u00d7 polarizations. The normalization factor 5/8\u03c0 is introduced so that \u03b3ij(f) = 1 for colocated and cooriented interferometers [11]. A closed form for the integral (A2) is derived in Refs. [11, 124].\nFigure 10 shows the ORFs for our fiducial 3-detector network. The ORFs for detector pairs in the ET triangle are approximately constant, with a value of about \u03b3ij(f) \u2248 \u22120.38 in the entire observation band [117, 125], as the detectors are almost colocated. The amplitude of the ORFs for the CE detectors with any detector in the network drops rapidly, meaning that the network sensitivity to SGWBs will be dominated by ET at high frequency. The amplitude of the ORF for a pair of CEs located in the U.S. and in Australia is close to zero due to the relative orientations of the interferometers: in our fiducial setting, the projection of the bisectors of these two detectors onto the local horizontal plane are rotated by an angle of about \u03c0/4 with respect to each other [77].\nBy analogy with Eq. (9), we can define an effective network noise PSD [123]\nSn,net(f) = Ndet\u2211 i=1 Ndet\u2211 j>i\n\u03b32ij(f)\nSn,i(f)Sn,j(f) \u22121/2 . (A3) Any noise PSD Sn(f) can be interpreted as the mean square amplitude of the noise per unit frequency, and is associated to a spectral energy density \u221d fSn(f) [103, 126]. Therefore, by applying the definition [Eq. (7)], we can introduce an effective dimensionless noise energy spectrum\n14\nfor the detector network [123, 127]\n\u2126n(f) = 10\u03c02\n3H20 f3Sn,net(f) , (A4)\nsuch that the optimal SNR [Eq. (A1)] can be rewritten as\nSNRb =\n[ 2T \u222b \u221e 0 df \u21262GW(f) \u21262n(f) ]1/2 . (A5)\nMost SGWBs take the form of power laws, i.e.,\n\u2126GW(f) = \u2126\u03b2\n( f\nfref\n)\u03b2 , (A6)\nwhere fref is an arbitrary reference frequency and \u2126\u03b2 is the amplitude of the background evaluated at f = fref . Most cosmological backgrounds are pure power laws [30\u2013 32, 112], and even the CBC background can be approximated by a power law at lower frequencies, in the regime where the inspiral phase dominates [95]. By plugging\nEq. (A6) into Eq. (A5), we can compute the amplitude that corresponds to SNRb = 1 for a given spectral index \u03b2:\n\u2126\u03b2 =\n[ 1\n2T \u222b \u221e 0 df (f/fref) 2\u03b2 \u21262n(f) ]\u22121/2 . (A7)\nEach pair (\u2126\u03b2 , \u03b2) corresponds to a different power-law background (A6) with network SNR equal to one. We call the power-law integrated sensitivity curve the envelope of all these backgrounds, i.e. [123]\n\u2126PI(f) = max \u03b2\n[ \u2126\u03b2 ( f\nfref\n)\u03b2] . (A8)\nThis curve represents a natural way to estimate the detector network sensitivity to SGWBs, as any power-law SGWB that lies somewhere above the curve has SNRb > 1, and thus it may be detectable.\nThe network sensitivity shown in Fig. 8 is a power-law integrated sensitivity curve computed with the formalism described here for our fiducial 3-detector network, assuming an observing time T = 1 yr.\n[1] B.
