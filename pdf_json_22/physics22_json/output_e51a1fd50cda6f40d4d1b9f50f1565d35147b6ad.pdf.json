We assume that the edges e1, . . . , e|E| have lengths t1, . . . , t|E| respectively (we will also write te for e \u2208 E), and these numbers are linearly independent over Q, which corresponds to a situation of general position. Let one of the vertices be selected in the metric graph. We will call it a source. The random walk starts at the source. At each vertex of the metric graph, the next edge is selected with nonzero probability. Accordingly, reflection occurs in hanging vertices. Edge turns are not allowed. The endpoint (final position) of such a walk can be not only a vertex, but also any point on an arbitrary edge of the metric graph.\nFrom counting the number of possible endpoints of a random walk on edges, it is convenient to pass to the following dynamical system (see [2]), the study of which is motivated by the problem of studying the behavior of wave packets initially localized in a small neighborhood of a single point and propagating on metric graphs or hybrid spaces (see [7] and links therein). At the initial moment of time, points move from the source vertex along all incident edges with unit speed. At the time when k points, where k can take values from 1 to valency \u03c1, come to a vertex, \u03c1 points appear, which go out along all edges incident to vertex. Let us denote by N(T ) the number of points that move along the graph by time T . The function N(T ) is piecewise constant, nondecreasing. We assume that the value of N(T ) at the discontinuity points is equal to half the sum of the limits on the left and on the right. It turns out that the function N(T ) has a polynomial asymptotics as T \u2192 \u221e (see paper [6], were the polynomial approximating N(T ) is described, and references therein).\nLet us take the number of edges |E| and the incommensurable lengths of the edges t1, . . . , t|E|.

Our goal is to describe the class of graphs for which N\u0393(T ) grows in the slowest way as T \u2192 \u221e.\nLet us note that for natural edge lengths there is a related question about choosing a graph with maximum stabilization time N(T ) (see [3]). The number N(T ) in this case always stops growing. So it is interesting to find the time when this happens (it is called the stabilization time). A recent paper [8] was devoted to this problem. The class of graphs for which the stabilization time is maximum contains a long chain of edges with an odd cycle at the end (opposite the source)."

Therefore, \u0393 must be a tree. Accordingly, the comparison of N\u0393(T ) for different rooted trees \u0393 should take place at the level of the second term of the N(T ) asymptotics.\nLet us note that the answer to a related question about the class of graphs of maximum growth can be obtained only from the first term of the asymptotics. The maximum growth is obtained by the complete graph K|E| on |E| edges.\nIn the paper [5] it was proved that for a rooted metric tree \u0393\nN(T ) = N1T |E|\u22121 +N2T |E|\u22122 + o(T |E|\u22122),\nwhere\nN2 = 1\n(|E| \u2212 2)!2|E|\u22122 \u220f e\u2208E te P2(t1, . . . , t|E|)\n2P2(t1, . . . , t|E|) = \u2212 \u2211\ne,f\u2208E\ntetf\u2212 \u2211\ne\u2208E\nt2e\u2212 \u2211\ne\u2208H\nt2e+2 \u2211\ne\u2208H,f\u2208E\ntetf+ \u2211\ne\u2208E\n\u2211\nf\u2208up(e)\ntetf , (1)\nwhere H is the set of hanging edges, that is, such that the edge has an end of degree 1 that is not a root; up(e) is a simple chain leading from the end of the edge e to the root of the tree (the edge itself is included in this chain).

            "text": "vertices except the root have degree 1 or 2);\n2) each of these chains has at least 2 edges (see fig. 2).\nProof. The main method that we use to find the class of graphs with minimal growth N(T ) is the transformation (surgery) of the graph \u0393, which preserves the connectivity, but the asymptotic growth of N(T ) becomes smaller.\nFirst transformation (T1): permutation of the edge down the so-called branch.\nDefinition 1. Let us consider a non-hanging edge e of the rooted tree \u0393. A branch br(e) given by an edge e is a subtree consisting of edges up(e) and all edges f such that e \u2208 up(f) (this is the set of all descendants and ancestors of edge e) (see fig. 2).\nLet us define the first transformation (T1) of the rooted tree. Let us take a non-hanging edge e of the tree and consider its branch br(e). Consider any hanging edge b \u2208 br(e). Let us denote l = up(b) \\ ({b} \u222a up(e)), D = br(e) \\ (up(e) \u222a {b}). Let us move the edge e to the end of the edge b as shown in Fig. 2.\nLemma 1. If the graph \u0393\u2032 is obtained from \u0393 by the transformation T1, then P2,\u0393 \u2265 P2,\u0393\u2032 . Moreover, if D \\ l 6= \u2205, then P2,\u0393 > P2,\u0393\u2032 .\nProof. During the transformation of T1, the set of hanging edges has not changed, so the first four terms in the formula (1) have not changed. It remains to follow how the fifth term has changed. For edges f located in up(e), the set up(f) has not changed. For the edges f \u2208 D (see Fig. 2) the set up(f) is decreased by the edge\ne. The set up(b) has not changed. The set up(e) has increased by the edges of a simple chain l (see Fig. 2).

Let the graph have a hanging edge b, one of the ends of which has a degree greater than 2. The transformation T2 joins this edge to the neighboring edge d (see Fig. 2).\nLemma 2. If the graph \u0393\u2032 is obtained from \u0393 by the T2 transformation, then P2,\u0393 > P2,\u0393\u2032 .\nProof.\n2P2,\u0393 \u2212 2P2,\u0393\u2032 = \u2212 \u2211\ne\u2208D\ntetb + t 2 b + 2tb\n\u2211\ne\u2208E,e 6=b\nte > 0\nLet us proceed to the proof of the theorem. Let us prove part 1. We take a branch br(e) of the non-hanging edge e. If the branch br(e) is not a simple chain, then by transformation T1 we can reduce the asymptotics of N(T ). Thus, in the graph \u0393, for which the growth of N(T ) is minimal, all branches must be simple chains. This means that the graph \u0393 is the union of simple chains coming out of the root.\nLet us prove part 2. If one of the simple chains has length 1, then it is a hanging edge, and by the transformation T2 this hanging edge can be moved into the neighboring chain, thus reducing the asymptotics of N(T )."
