    "abstractText": "The existence of various physical phenomena stems from the concept called asymptotic emergence, that is, they seem to be exclusively reserved for certain limiting theories. Important examples are spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) and phase transitions: these would only occur in the classical or thermodynamic limit of underlying finite quantum systems, since for finite quantum systems, due to the uniqueness of the relevant states, such phenomena are excluded by Theory. In Nature, however, finite quantum systems describing real materials clearly exhibit such effects. In this paper we discuss these apparently \u201cparadoxical\u201d phenomena and outline various ideas and mechanisms that encompass both theory and reality, from physical and mathematical points of view.",

Examples include spontaneous symmetry breaking, the theory of phase transitions, Bose-Einstein condensation, and so on. This can be done at various levels of rigor. In any event, unless perhaps in very simple cases, one can not avoid making assumptions and thus will consider a certain model that approaches reality.1 This for example already happens in the study of the hyperfine structure of the spectrum of the Hydrogen atom, where one often \u201cneglects\u201d the relativistic interactions which are strictly speaking always present. Depending on the purpose of the study such assumptions are usually well founded and therefore they (often) do not affect the description of the physical system of interest.\n* Christiaan J. F. van\u00a0de Ven christiaan.vandeven@mathematik.uni-wuerzburg.de\n1 Julius-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t W\u00fcrzburg, Emil-Fischer-Stra\u00dfe 40, 97074\u00a0W\u00fcrzburg, Germany\n1 The precise meaning of \u201capproximation of reality\u201d is an important point in of discussion the philosophy of physics [1\u20133]. Our starting point is the one due to Butterfield [4], clarified below.\nFoundations of Physics (2023) 53:79\n1 3\n79 Page 2 of 23\nHowever, describing Nature by means of a suitable theoretical model does not always have to give a correct result consistent with experimental predictions: it can create a serious mismatch between theory and reality. A particular case for which this mismatch leads to significant ambiguity is the manifestation of emergence, that is, according to Butterfield\u2019s first claim [4], a theoretical framework that describes phenomena as having behavior that is new and robust with respect to some comparison class.2 In this paper we rather focus on asymptotic emergence in the context of limits, in which emergent behavior occurs in a \u201chigher-level\u201d theory being a limit of a sequence of \u201clower-level\u201d theories, typically as some parameter, e.g. N corresponding to the size of a lattice describing quantum statistical mechanics goes to infinity, or in the spirit of the classical limit, Planck\u2019s constant \u210f to zero. This concept allows studying emergent phenomena inherent in nature in a mathematically rigorous way, namely by the theory of continuous field of C\u2217-algebras and in view of the classical limit, by strict deformation quantization [6].\nOn the one hand, we emphasize that this notion of emergence may be viewed as a form of reduction (in the sense of deduction), in that, considering N \u2192 \u221e (resp. \u210f \u2192 0 ) enables one to deduce novel and robust behavior compared to that of systems described for finite N (resp. non-zero \u210f ). This is confirmed by two important examples one encounters in physics, namely spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) and phase transitions. Indeed, theoretically speaking SSB and phase transitions can only show up in classical or infinite quantum theories seen as a classical, respectively thermodynamic limit of an underlying finite quantum theory; and these features can be deduced after taking the limit of some parameter, explained in more detail in \u00a72.2 (see also [7\u201310]).\nOn the other hand, as we know from decades of experience and experimental results, emergent phenomena such as SSB or phase transitions are observed in real materials, and therefore in finite systems despite the fact that\u00a0due to uniqueness principles in Theory, they\u00a0seem forbidden in such systems. This does therefore not show that the limit at N = \u221e is \u201cphysically real\u201d. The solution to this paradox is based on Butterfield\u2019s second claim [4]\n\u201cThere is a weaker, yet still vivid, novel and robust behavior that occurs before we get to the limit, i.e. for finite N. And it is this weaker behavior which is physically real.\u201d\nThis can be interpreted in the sense that a robust behavior of the physical phenomenon should occur before the pertinent limit, i.e. in systems described with a finite (respectively, non-zero) parameter, meaning large but\u00a0finite N in the case of quantum spin systems or tiny but positive values of Planck\u2019s constant \u210f in the case of classical systems. This principle, what we call Butterfield\u2019s Principle, is taken to be our definition of emergence.\nThis paper is structured in the following way. In Sect.\u00a01.1 we introduce the concept of phase transitions and spontaneous symmetry breaking, first from a more physical point of view often used in condensed matter physics followed by a\n2 We also\u00a0refer to the recent book by Palacios [5] for an overview of the topics of emergence and reduction in the philosophy of physics.\n1 3\nFoundations of Physics (2023) 53:79 Page 3 of 23 79\nmathematical approach common in algebraic quantum theory. In Sect.\u00a02 the algebraic formalism suitable to describe classical and quantum theories is introduced. Using this language in \u00a72.1 the definition of the classical limit is given. In \u00a72.2 the connection with asymptotic emergence is explained and two examples (Examples 2.3 and 2.4) are provided. In Sect.\u00a0 3 the relation between SSB in Theory versus Nature is discussed. A solution to the above paradox compatible with Butterfield\u2019s Principle is given by a mathematical mechanism and is illustrated by means of numerical simulations. Finally, in \u00a73.3 the analogy between our approach and the measurement problem is outlined. The paper is concluded by posing some open problems."

            "text": "Phase transitions are everywhere in nature. They lay the foundation of many physical phenomena, like the formation of Bose-Einstein condensates, superconductivity of metals and so on. The general belief behind a phase transition is the occurrence of discontinuities in thermodynamic functionals and singularities in response functions. From a theoretical point of view\u00a0these\u00a0only arise\u00a0in the relevant limit of underlying finite quantum\u00a0theories.\nPractically speaking, incipient discontinuities of the relevant thermodynamic functionals are already observed in experiments, e.g. as the number of particles increases, most of the change in the magnetization occurs more and more steeply, i.e. it occurs in a smaller and smaller interval around the applied field being zero [11]. Thus the magnetic susceptibility, defined as the derivative of magnetization with respect to magnetic field, is, in the neighborhood of zero, larger for larger N, and tends to infinity as N \u2192 \u221e . However, at finite N no such singularity is present. This confirms Butterfield\u2019s Principle: the singularities which appear from experiment to exist in finite systems are not in fact singularities, but correspond to \u201crobust behavior\u201d encoded by steep maxima (incipient discontinuities) that precede the singular behavior the theory demonstrates in infinite systems.\nAnother more abstract picture, common in algebraic quantum theory to study phase transitions is based on the celebrated Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) condition describing thermal equilibrium at fixed inverse temperature [12]. A phase transition is now reformulated by saying that the associated -KMS states are nonunique, that is, the coexistence of more than one -KMS state for a given dynamics. At\u00a0positive temperature, however,\u00a0KMS states are always unique for any finite system: no phase transitions take place [13]. This rather abstract point of view is the usual one in modern mathematical physics; and it applies in general, i.e., it is not model-dependent. There is however also a drawback: this approach studies properties of states, and generally does not consider steep maxima. Consequently, slowly emerging singular behavior is not taken into account and therefore it is not clear at all how to restore Butterfield\u2019s Principle. We will come back to this point in Sect.\u00a03.\nLike phase transitions, symmetry and symmetry-breaking effects affect numerous areas and aspects of mathematical and theoretical physics, e.g. it plays a role in\nFoundations of Physics (2023) 53:79\n1 3\n79 Page 4 of 23\nthe Higgs mechanism providing mass generation of W and Z bosons, i.e. the gauge bosons that mediate the weak interaction [14]. The general and common concept behind spontaneous symmetry breaking, originating in the field of condensed matter physics where one typically considers the limit of large particle numbers, often also called thermodynamic limit, is based on the idea that if a collection of quantum particles becomes larger, the symmetry of the system as a whole becomes increasingly\u00a0unstable against small perturbations [15, 16]. A similar statement can be made for quantum systems in their classical limit, where sensitivity against small perturbations now should be understood to hold in the relevant semi-classical regime, meaning that a certain parameter (e.g. \u210f ) approaches zero,3 [6, 8].\nTo show the occurrence of SSB in a certain particle system various approaches of different levels of rigor are used. There are however some differences between the mathematical physics approach to SSB and the methods used in theoretical and condensed matter physics. In the latter, based mainly on the ideas of Bogoliubov, the idea that the system in question becomes sensitive to small perturbations is generally implemented by\u00a0adding a so-called infinitesimal symmetry-breaking field term to the Hamiltonian, from which one then wants to show that the limit of large particle numbers or the thermodynamic limit becomes \u201csingular\u201d [18, 19], at least at the level of states, e.g. the ground state. If this happens, one says that the symmetry of the limiting system is spontaneously broken. To illustrate this we consider the quantum Ising Hamiltonian HQI\nN with N sites, i.e.\nHere k(j) stands for I2 \u2297\u22ef\u2297 \ud835\udf0ek \u2297\u22ef\u2297 I2 , where k denotes the k-th spin Pauli matrix ( k = 1, 2, 3 ) occupying the j-th slot, and J,B \u2208 \u211d are given constants defining the strength of the spin-spin coupling and the (transverse) external magnetic field, respectively. The Hamiltonian HQI\nN is invariant under \u21242 - parity symmetry. For\nfinite N, it is a well-known fact that the ground state eigenvector is (up to a phase) unique and therefore \u21242 -invariant: no SSB occurs. In order to observe SSB in the limit N \u2192 \u221e we take B \u2208 (0, 1) and the constant J then may be chosen as one.

In the context of the classical limit, the zero-limit of this parameter corresponds to a classical theory, encoded by a commutative C\u2217-algebra. The general and correct formalism to deal with the classical limit is called strict deformation quantization, also called C\u2217-algebraic deformation quantization.\n1 3\nFoundations of Physics (2023) 53:79 Page 5 of 23 79\nIn this approach one argues that the correct order of the limits should be lim \u2192 0 limN \u2192 \u221e [20, 16], which gives SSB by one of the two pure ground states on the quasi-local algebra \u2245 M2(\u2102)\u2297\u221e , one of them defined by tensor products of \ufffd \u2191\u27e9 and the other by tensor products of \ufffd \u2193\u27e9 , where 3\ufffd \u2191\u27e9 = \ufffd \u2191\u27e9 and 3\ufffd \u2193\u27e9 = \u2212\ufffd \u2193\u27e9 . The the sign of then determines the direction of symmetry breaking (i.e. which of the limiting states is produced). In contrast, the opposite order limN \u2192 \u221e lim \u2192 0 gives a symmetric but mixed ground state on . The symmetry is then said to be broken spontaneously if there is a difference in the order of the limits, as exactly happens in this example. In this sense, if SSB occurs, the limit N \u2192 \u221e can indeed be seen as singular [18, 19]. However, this approach gives\u00a0no insight in the physical mechanism of SSB\u00a0 and has been quite rightly challenged in the philosophical literature of physics [4]. Without going into the mathematical details this paper instead is based on a definition of SSB that is standard in algebraic quantum theory, i.e. it is encapsulated in terms of an algebraic formulation of symmetries and ground states [13, 6]. The advantage of this approach is that it equally applies to finite and infinite systems, and to classical and quantum systems, namely it states that the ground (or equilibrium) state, suitably defined of a system with G-invariant dynamics (where G is some group, usually a discrete group or a Lie group) is either pure but not G-invariant, or G-invariant but mixed.4 Subsequently, in the spirit of the above discussion the \u201csingularity\u201d of the thermodynamic limit of systems with SSB is the fact that the exact pure ground state of a finite quantum system converges to a mixed state on the limit system, explained in detail in [7\u201310]. The use of the word \u201csingularity\u201d here should thus not be confused with a discontinuous or singular limit. All we mean is the inability to decompose the finite quantum state (pure state), where in the limit, however, this is possible.\nThis\u00a0 defnition is therefore\u00a0 compatible with the general belief that SSB only occurs in the relevant limit. However, despite being mathematically correct, this approach does not confirm Butterfield\u2019s Principle, nor does it achieve the main idea that spontaneous symmetry breaking must be related to instability and sensitivity of the system to small perturbations in the relevant regime, manifested by the presence of non-invariant pure states rather than the unstable or non-physically mixed state. It is precisely the aim of this article to provide a natural mechanism that is mathematically correct and physically relevant, combining these (seemly different) notions of symmetry breaking into a self-contained theory.\n(1.3) QI 1\u2215N = N\u2211 x=1 3(x).\n4 Even though at first sight both approaches to SSB might seem different, it turns out that in some cases the former approach is related to the algebraic one (see e.g. [21, Prop. 1.6, Lemma 1.7] and [22, Ch. 6]). Whichever approach to symmetry breaking one chooses, each has its pros and cons and which method is chosen depends on the specific purpose.\nFoundations of Physics (2023) 53:79\n1 3\n79 Page 6 of 23"

Hence, the possibility of SSB, in the usual sense of having a family of asymmetric pure ground states related by the action of G, seems to be reserved for infinite systems. Using the analogy between the thermodynamic limit and the classical limit (Section \u00a72.1), an exact similar situation occurs in quantum mechanics of finite systems (SSB typically absent), versus classical mechanics, which allows it. Therefore, generally speaking, spontaneous symmetry breaking can be seen as natural emergent phenomenon8 meaning that it only occurs in the limit (be it an infinite quantum or a classical system) of an underlying finite quantum theory.\nLet us give two examples of SSB occurring in the classical limit. The first example concerns a certain class of Schr\u00f6dinger operators where emphasis is put to the classical limit in \u210f \u2192 0 appearing in front of the Laplacian, the second example is the quantum Curie-Weiss model where the parameter \u210f \u2192 0 is interpreted as the limit of large number of particles N.\nExample 2.3 (Schr\u00f6dinger operator) Consider the Schr\u00f6dinger operator H\u210f suitably defined on a dense domain of L2(\u211dn) by\nwhere \u0394 is the Laplacian and V a potential acting by multiplication. We take V to be of the form V(x) = (x2 \u2212 1)2 , describing particularly a double well ( n = 1 ) or Mexican hat ( n = 2 ) potential. Clearly V is invariant under the natural SO(n)-action, and this property transfers to H\u210f . Furthermore, by standard results H\u210f has compact resolvent [27], and as a result of the (infinite version of the) Perron-Frobenius Theorem, the ground state eigenvector \u03a8(0)\n\u210f of the corresponding Schr\u00f6dinger operator H\u210f is\n(up to phases) unique. The following facts are valid.\n- The algebraic (pure) ground state (0) \u210f (\u22c5) = \u27e8\u03a8(0) \u210f , \u22c5\u03a8 (0) \u210f \u27e9 is unique and SO(n)invariant. Hence, no SSB occurs for any \u210f \u2260 0. - In a similar fashion as in Example 2.2 the classical limit 0 = lim\u210f\u21920 (0) \u210f exists; it yields a SO(n)-invariant mixed state (0) 0 , given by\nwhere G denotes the associated Haar measure, and 0 \u2208 \u211d2n is an arbitrary point in the level set \u03a30 \u2236= { = (q, p) | p = 0, ||q|| = 1} .

In that case, one must show that the KMS states at inverse temperature, which are unique for finite systems, coexist in infinite systems. This is much harder problem than the study of SSB, since in general no additional symmetry is imposed on the relevant model. One usually tries to show that the quantum free energy function converges, followed by characterizing its minima and analyzing its continuity properties.

This induces the obvious action on the classical phase space \u211d2n , i.e., R(p, q) = (Rp,Rq), ((p, q) \u2208 \u211d2n) , as well as a unitary map U on the Hilbert space H \u2236= H\u210f = L2(\u211dn) defined by UR (x) = (R\n\u22121x) . Furthermore, as we have seen in Example 2.3, for any \ufffd > 0 and n \u2208 \u2115 the ground state of this Hamiltonian is unique and hence invariant under the SO(n) action; with an appropriate phase choice it can be chosen to be real and strictly positive. Yet the associated classical Hamiltonian\n(3.1)H\u210f = \u2212\u210f2 d2\ndx2 + (x2 \u2212 1)2,\n(3.2)hsch0 (p, q) = p 2 + (q2 \u2212 1)2,\nFoundations of Physics (2023) 53:79\n1 3\n79 Page 12 of 23\ndefined on the classical phase space \u211d2n , has a degenerate ground state depending on the dimension n. For convenience we focus on two cases, n = 1 and n = 2 . The case n = 1 , corresponding to the symmetric double well potential with \u21242-symmetry, the minima of V are obviously two-fold degenerate and given by the Dirac measures \u00b1 defined by\nwhere the point(s) (p = 0, q = \u00b11) are the (absolute) minima of hsch 0 . These (pure) states are clearly not \u21242-invariant. Indeed, the \u21242-action on \u211d2 induced by he nontrivial element of \u21242 is defined by the map \u2236 x \u21a6 \u2212x , so that \u00b1 \u21a6 \u2213.\nThe case n = 2 is\u00a0 the famous Mexican hat potential with SO(2) rotation symmetry. As we have seen before the level set \u03a30 = (hsch0 )\n\u22121({0}) corresponds to the SO(2)-orbit through the points ( ||p|| = 0 and ||q|| = 1 .) This set of \u201cclassical\u201d ground states is now connected and forms a circle in phase space. This is the idea of the (classical) Goldstone Theorem, a particle can freely move in this circle at no cost of energy, i.e., the motion in the orbit \u03a30 is free. Similarly, since each point in phase space is rotated under the SO(2) action, no point in \u03a30 is SO(2)-invariant.\nTo explain the issue about the existence of spontaneous symmetry breaking in Nature rather than Theory, then translates to the quest for a mechanism that reproduces Dirac measures in the relevant limit. To do this, we summarize two important approaches used in literature."

In the limit (i.e. either \u210f \u2192 0 or N \u2192 \u221e ) these low-lying eigenstates, still defining a pure state, converge to some symmetrybreaking pure ground state on the relevant limit system.

This means that some approximate and robust form of symmetry breaking should already occur before the pertinent limit (viz. finite N or non-zero \u210f ), despite the fact that uniqueness of the ground state seems to forbid this. To accomplish this, it must be shown that for finite N or \ufffd > 0 the system is not in its exact ground state, but in some other state having the property that as N \u2192 \u221e or \u210f \u2192 0 , it converges in a suitable sense (see the discussion in \u00a72.1 and [9]) to a symmetry-broken ground state of the limit system, which is either an infinite quantum system or a classical system. Since the symmetry of a state is preserved under the limits in question, this implies that the actual physical state at finite N or \u210f must already break the symmetry.\nA natural setting taking this into account is based on some form of perturbation theory [30, 20]. Although in a different context, this approach, first introduced by Jona-Lasinio et\u00a0al. [31] and later called the \u201cFlea on the elephant\u201d by Simon [32], is based on the fact that the exact ground state of a slightly\u00a0perturbed Hamiltonian approximates the right physical (symmetry-broken) state in such a way that this perturbed ground state is G-invariant for relatively large values of \ufffd > 0 (or similarly, for small values of N), but when approaching the relevant limiting regime (i.e. \ufffd \u226a 1 or N \u226b 0 ) the perturbed ground state loses its G-invariance,11 and therefore breaks the symmetry already before the ensuing limit. The physical intuition behind this mechanism is that these tiny perturbations should arise naturally and might correspond either to imperfections of the material or contributions to the Hamiltonian from the environment. This is therefore\u00a0a version of the physical idea that the symmetry of the system in question should become highly sensitive to small perturbations in the relevant regime (viz. Section\u00a01).\nTo see what this means in a very simple context we again consider the Schr\u00f6dinger operator defined by (3.1) for n = 1.12 As already mentioned, for any \ufffd > 0 the (normalized) ground state \u03a8(0)\n\u210f \u2208 L2(\u211d) of this Hamiltonian is unique and\nhence invariant under the \u21242-symmetry (x) \u21a6 (\u2212x) ; with an appropriate phase choice it is real, strictly positive, and doubly peaked above x = \u00b11 . The classical Hamiltonian hsch\n0 \u2208 C(\u211d2) has a two-fold degenerate ground state, given by the\nDirac measures \u00b1 defined by (3.3). As predicted by Theory, the symmetric mixed state 0 = 1\n2 ( + + \u2212) turned out to be the classical limit of the exact algebraic\nground state \u210f of (3.1) as \u210f \u2192 0 . In view of the previous discussions we perturb (3.1) by adding an asymmetric term V (i.e., the \u201cflea\u201d), which, however small it is, under reasonable assumptions localizes the ground state ( )\n\u210f of the perturbed\n12 To visualize the situation properly we restrict the Schr\u00f6dinger operator to L2([\u22122, 2]).\n11 We remind the reader that for any \ufffd > 0 or N < \u221e the unperturbed ground state of a generic Hamiltonian is typically G-invariant, so that no SSB occurs. Therefore, strictly speaking any approach to symmetry breaking in Nature ( \ufffd > 0 or N < \u221e ) is explicit rather than spontaneous.\n1 3\nHamiltonian H( ) \u210f = H\u210f + V in such a way that ( ) \u210f \u2192 + or \u2212 (rather than the unphysical mixture 0 ) depending on the sign and location of V .13 According to the results proved in [32] to get localization the perturbed Hamiltonian should have the following properties:\nProperty 3.1\n\u2022 V is smooth, bounded and vanishes in a neighbourhood of the minima of V. \u2022 The support of V is localized at positive distance from the minima of V, but not\ntoo \u201cfar\u201d, meaning that its support is located not farther way than the Agmon distance between the two minimal points (see [32, 20] for technical details).\n\u25aa Remark 3.2 The first condition of Property 3.1 means that the perturbation should not have any support at the minimum set itself. The physical interpretation is that tiny perturbations should induce symmetry breaking for small values of \u210f , but the symmetry of the minimum (or more generally, the level) set itself should be untouched to not affect the physical situation. The second condition means that the perturbation is indeed \u201ceffective\u201d. For example, if the perturbation is such that the\n13 In this approach there is therefore no need for \u201clow-lying eigenstates\u201d, i.e. the exact ground state of the perturbed model already reflects the physical situation as is clearly visible from Fig.\u00a02.

This is confirmed in Figs.\u00a01-2, where the perturbed potential V + V and the ground state eigenvector of H( )\n\u210f for several values of \u210f are plotted.14 From Fig.\u00a02 it\nis clear that the ground state eigenfunction already localizes for relatively small, but positive values of \u210f , whilst for relatively large values of \u210f the state is \u21242-invariant. For such small values of \u210f the ground state is definitely not \u21242-invariant anymore, and therefore it corresponds to the physical (symmetry broken) ground state yielding a Dirac measure in the\u00a0subsequent limit \u210f \u2192 0 . This precisely confirms the essence of the argument and the flea mechanism: SSB is already foreshadowed in quantum mechanics for small yet positive \u210f.\nRemark 3.3 It has been numerically checked that for the values of \u210f used to compute the ground state eigenfunction \u03a8( )\n\u210f of H( ) \u210f , the ground state energy E( ) 0 is\u00a0 indeed\nnon-degenerate: no degeneracy effects due to numerical noise has played a role.\u00a0 Therefore, for these values of \u210f (obviously, they depend on the machine precision of the computer used to perform calculations) the simulations accurately reflect the uniqueness of the ground state, proved from general theory on Schr\u00f6dinger operators. \u25aa\nRemark 3.4 We stress that this \u201cflea mechanism\u201d has been independently verified for mean-field quantum spin systems in the thermodynamic limit N \u2192 \u221e in [20]. In this\n14 The ground state wave function of the perturbed Hamiltonian (which has two peaks for V = 0 ) localizes in a direction in which the perturbation assumes a relative minimum. For example, if V is positive and is localized to the right, then the relative energy in the left-hand part of the double well is lowered, so that localization will be to the left. If V is negative and localized on the right, then the localization will be to the right, as is the case in Fig.\u00a02.\n1 3\nwork a suitable perturbation in spin space has been defined having the same properties as perturbation (3.7). As a result the exact pure ground state of the perturbed quantum spin Hamiltonian converges to a pure state on the (in this case) phase space B3 \u2236= {(x, y, z) \u2208 \u211d3 | x2 + y2 + z2 \u2264 1} . \u25aa\nThe final example for which we show the validity of this mechanism is a 2d solid periodic metal. In order to represent a realistic situation, we will not use potentials with vertical walls, but rather a smoothly varying function taken to be a Gaussian potential [33] assuming the form\nwhere V0 represents the maximum depth of the well, (x0, y0) are the coordinates of the center of the well, and x and y are measures of the range of the well in either direction. For the purpose of this paper we focus on the cases x = y = a = 1 and x0 = y0 = 0 . The potential (3.8) represents a single cell and is translated in each direction to model the overall potential of the metal (see Fig.\u00a0 3). The symmetry group corresponding to such potential is the discrete group \u2124N acting in the obvious way (i.e. by addition) and N2 denotes the total number of atoms. In what follows we consider the 2d Schr\u00f6dinger operator induced by the potential (3.8), i.e.\nand we impose periodic boundary conditions and consider a finite domain. By Bloch\u2019s Theorem it follows that solutions to the eigenvalue problem H\u210f \u210f = E\u210f \u210f\n(3.8)V(x, y) = V0e \u2212\n( x (x\u2212x0) 2\na2 + y\n(y\u2212y0) 2\na2\n)\n,\n(3.9)H\u210f = \u2212\u210f2 ( d2\ndx2 +\nd2\ndy2\n) + V(x, y),\n1 3\nexist and take the form of a plane wave modulated by a periodic function. In a similar fashion as Example 2.3 and Example 2.4 one can show that the algebraic vector state induced by the ground state eigenvector is \u2124N-invariant and localizes in each single well, as \u210f \u2192 0.\nTo move on our discussion regarding localization we perturb the potential (3.8) with a \u201cflea-like\u201d perturbation (cf. Property 3.1). In the same spirit as for the double well potential our perturbation is chosen to be strictly positive and bounded away from each of the minima. To avoid numerical complications we have taken the perturbation to be = 0.1 precisely on single grid points. An upper view of the perturbed potential is depicted in Fig.\u00a04.\nSimilarly to the double well potential one can think of\u00a0this perturbation as having the property that the relative energy of the lattice is minimized exactly towards one cell, but the absolute minima are untouched. This is visible from Fig.\u00a04, the center cell corresponding to x = y = 0 is relatively lower in energy then all other cells since the perturbation is positive. It is clear from Fig.\u00a05 that the perturbed ground state localizes at the point (0,\u00a00), as \u210f \u2192 0 . Clearly the associated state (a Dirac measure) breaks the relevant symmetry.\nAs before, it has been numerically checked that for the values of \u210f used to compute the ground state eigenfunction \u03a8( )\n\u210f of H( ) \u210f , the ground state energy E( ) 0 is non-\ndegenerate. Therefore, localization is not caused by \u201cnumerical noise\u201d that typically does play a role when the (strictly speaking) non-degenerate eigenenergies differ by an order of magnitude comparable with the machine precision.\nRemark 3.5 We note that this perturbative approach generalizes Anderson\u2019s mechanism. Indeed, the \u201cflea\u201d-mechanism that causes a pure state to arise in the classical limit has the same effect as the limit of the tower of states: it simply generates it! \u25aa\nFoundations of Physics (2023) 53:79\n1 3\n79 Page 20 of 23"

In broad terms, the measurement problem consists in the fact that the Schr\u00f6dinger equation of quantum mechanics fails to predict that measurements have single outcomes. Instead, it empirically predicts unacceptable \u201csuperpositions\u201d thereof. The obstacle here is that at first sight such super positions seem to survive the classical limit, as shown above by the ground state of the double-well potential in the limit \u210f \u2192 0 or by the ground state of the Curie-Weiss model in the limit N \u2192 \u221e . More generally, the measurement problem arises whenever in the classical limit a pure quantum state converges to a mixed classical state, since in that case quantum theory fails to predict a single measurement outcome; it rather suggests there are many outcomes. Consequently, the real problem is to show that under realistic measurement conditions pure quantum states actually have pure classical limits. As shown in [24] this is brought about precisely by the \u201cflea\u201d-mechanism. Indeed, In the presence of a small perturbation, the perturbed ground state will localize as \u210f \u2192 0 , resulting in a pure state (Dirac\n(3.10) ( )0 (f ) = { 1 2 ( (0,0,m \u22152(f ) + (0,0,\u2212m \u22152(f )), ( > 4);\n(0,0,0), ( \u2264 4),\n1 3\nFoundations of Physics (2023) 53:79 Page 21 of 23 79\nmeasure).

Several methods and mechanisms we discussed are compatible with the physical idea of symmetry breaking in Nature, namely that the limiting state should be pure and not G\u2212invariant.
