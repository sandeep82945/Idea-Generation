            "text": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) have gained momentum for treatment of cancers, with 14 ADCs currently approved for commercial use worldwide. (Fu, Li, Han, Shi, & Zhang, 2022) Calicheamicin is one of the payloads contributing to this trend, being utilized for both gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO, trade name: Mylotarg) and inotuzumab ozogamicin (IO, trade name: Besponsa). Here, we discuss the catabolic pathway and metabolism of ABBV-011, a novel SEZ6-targeted, calicheamicin-based ADC being investigated for the treatment of small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Specifically, our investigation has found that disulfide bond cleavage in N-acetyl-\u03b3-calicheamicin payload is a key liability that potentially impacts overall stability of the ADC. To our knowledge, there have been no reported observations of disulfide bond cleavage of calicheamicin ADCs. ABBV-011 utilizes a novel linker structure, leading to a distinct metabolic profile when compared to GO and IO. Despite this difference in linker structures, we propose that this liability may also be relevant for other calicheamicin ADCs. Multiple data sets supporting our investigation were acquired as part of the preclinical development of ABBV-011 and demonstrate the utility of in vitro experiments to characterize potential ADC candidates prior to clinical trials.\nThis article has not been copyedited and formatted.

            "text": "ABBV-011 is a SEZ6-directed antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) consisting of SC17, a humanized cysteine engineered immunoglobulin 1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody (mAb), that is conjugated in a site-specific manner to N-acetyl-\u03b3-calicheamicin through a noncleavable linker (LD19.10) (drug-antibody ratio = 2). This novel linker is structurally unique, relying on disulfide cleavage for payload release, cysteine maleimide conjugation for attachment, and a PEGylated spacer between the attachment and release points. As a result, ABBV-011 releases a unique profile of calicheamicin-based catabolites, with the most abundant being cyclized cysteine-LD19.10 (hereafter referred to as LD19.10-M8b, or simply M8b). The structure is shown in Figure 1.(Wiedemeyer et al., 2022)\nGO and IO both employ the same N-acetyl-\u03b3-calicheamicin linker-drug for treatment of hematological cancers. Serious adverse events such as thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and veno-occlusive disease have limited the utility of these agents.(Jen et al., 2018; Kantarjian et al., 2019; Kantarjian et al., 2016; Petersdorf et al., 2013) Three other calicheamicin ADCs, PF06647263,(Garrido-Laguna et al., 2019) CMD-193,(Herbertson et al., 2009) and CMB401,(Chan et al., 2003) all with the similar linker-drug as GO and IO, have been tested in clinical trials but were terminated for safety and/or efficacy reasons.\nCalicheamicin contains a strained ring enediyne structure. It binds to the minor groove of DNA where the trisulfide is cleaved. The resulting thiol intramolecularly conjugates to the enediyne to relieve ring strain generating a reactive diradical; the Bergman cyclization. The interchelated diradical then abstracts hydrogen atoms from DNA, leading to cleavage of the DNA chain.(Walker, Landovitz, Ding, Ellestad, & Kahne, 1992)\nThis article has not been copyedited and formatted.

This is consistent with IO which has a TmAb half-life of 67 hours (52% CV) and a total calicheamicin half-life of 17 hours (29% CV) in human(Advani et al., 2010) with a TmAb half-life of 55 hours and a total calicheamicin half-life of 29 hours in mouse.(Boghaert et al., 2008) All of the calicheamicin ADCs where pharmacokinetic (PK) data are available point to a separation of the TmAb and ADC PK profiles suggesting instability of the calicheamicin ADC in circulation.\nGO and IO both appear to be relatively stable (<10% cleavage) in rat, monkey, or human plasma or in the presence of serum levels of GSH up to 96 hours.(European Medicines Agency, 2018) Yet under conditions associated with intracellular compartments such as low pH (4.5) or intracellular GSH levels, linker cleavage is more facile.(European Medicines Agency, 2018) This may imply that the in vivo drug-antibody ratio (DAR) changes observed with GO and IO may partially result from linker cleavage during cellular recycling of the biologic.\nThe only measured metabolite from either IO or GO was the N-acetyl-\u03b3-calicheamicin DMH fragment, of which metabolism has been reported to be primarily disulfide reduction.(European Medicines Agency, 2017, 2018) Liver S9 metabolic studies suggest that a majority of disulfide reduction occurs non-enzymatically.(European Medicines Agency, 2018) No information is available on whether any steps were taken to preserve stability of the linker despite including a disulfide-bond. It has been suggested that the AcButDMH linker can be found to hydrolyze slowly in the systemic circulation, resulting in release of payload and off-target toxicity.(Fu, Li, Han, Shi, & Zhang, 2022) Another possibility is cleavage of the disulfide bonds to release the payload. ADC linker disulfide bond reduction has been shown to be catalyzed by thioredoxin\nThis article has not been copyedited and formatted. The final version may differ from this version.

(Zhang et al., 2019)\nIt has been suggested that the high in vivo aggregation of GO may be due to AcButDMH linker hydrophobicity. Consistent with this hypothesis, Genentech has reported ADCs with \u201clinkerless\u201d payload attachment lower the aggregate level which correlates to an observed total antibody half-life of 24 days and an observed conjugated ADC half-life of 21 days in mouse. (Vollmar et al., 2021)\nDuring the development of ABBV-011, the ligand binding assay (LBA) analysis of in vivo cyno PK samples observed a disconnect between total antibody (TAb) and conjugated ADC concentrations (Figure 2, Supplemental Table 1) consistent with previous observations with GO and IO. This triggered a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments to understand the mechanism of this instability. Here, we discuss the results of these experiments, including characterization of in vitro plasma stability by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) of the intact ADC, as well as analysis of payload metabolites released in plasma, lysosome, and liver S9 matrices. These in vitro observations correlated well with in vivo ABBV-011 cyno toxicokinetic studies and likely are involved with the differential exposures of TAb and ADC concentrations for GO and IO.\nThis article has not been copyedited and formatted.

The MS data was analysed within the Bruker BioPharma Compass software using the maximum entropy deconvolution algorithm. Peak intensities of deconvoluted light chain and heavy chain (or dimers for non-reduced samples) with or without the linker drug were recorded for all time points. In addition, masses corresponding to the unconjugated species as well as linker-drug clippings/degradation were noted and monitored.

Table 1 provides a summary of these observed metabolites. Major metabolites are presented in Figure 3, while minor metabolite structures are shown in Supplemental Figure 2.\nThe major in vivo circulating metabolites were cyclized cysteine-LD19.10 (M8b) and its linear isomer (M8a), and the N-acetyl-\u03b5-calicheamicin product of the Bergman cyclization (M1) and its O-linked deglycosylated tetra-saccharide metabolite (M3). M1 and M3 were confirmed to be inactive metabolites.\nIn Vitro Liver S9 Incubation\nInvestigation of the in vitro metabolism of M8b in monkey and human liver S9 systems and ABBV-011 in rat and human liver S9 systems identified several metabolic pathways. The metabolic pathways identified for M8b involved reduction of the disulfide (M1), enzymatic Odeglycosylation of the tetra-saccharide followed by subsequent dehydrogenation (M4), and oxidation of the dehydrogenated tetra-saccharide (M9). Rearrangement of cyclic M8b to linear M8a was also observed.

Following 48 hour incubation of 50 \u03bcg/mL of ABBV-011 in both human liver lysosomes and rat liver tritosomes at 37\u00b0C, two catabolites were observed, including M8a and NRGEC-capped LD19.10 (M6). Following 72 hour plasma incubation of 300 \u03bcg/mL of ABBV-011 at 37\u00b0C, five metabolites were observed in human plasma, while rat and monkey plasma exhibited six metabolites each. The metabolic pathways in cross species plasma incubation primarily involve retro-Michael addition (M8b), disulfide reduction (M1), hydrolysis of cysteine-LD19.10 (M2), O-linked deglycosylation (M3), subsequent dehydrogenation (M4), and reduction (M7). Qualitatively similar profiles were observed for ABBV-011 in cross species plasma incubations. There was no human-specific metabolite identified in lysosome and plasma incubation.\nABBV-011: In Vitro and In Vivo Cyno Plasma Stability\nStability of ABBV-011 was investigated in vitro by incubating the ADC in cyno plasma up to 7 days and in vivo using the cyno study samples, thereby immuno-purifying the ADC from matrix and analyzing in high-resolution-TOF MS system (as indicated in the method section). Intact mass analysis of both the datasets observed a major conjugated metabolite (CM1) as a result of hindered disulfide reduction on the light chain conjugated linker drug (LD) thereby releasing the calicheamicin-SH payload as the free thiol (Figure 4). Over time CM1 converted to CM2 as a result of cysteinylation of the free cysteine after the disulfide bridge breakdown. An increase in CM2 was observed over time both in vitro and in vivo. Overall decrease in the conjugated light chain with linker drug (LC+LD) as well as unconjugated (free) light chain signal was observed along with an increase in cysteinylated light chain over time.

Four metabolites (M1, M3, M4 and M8b) were observed in rat plasma, and two metabolites (M3 and M8b) were observed in cynomolgus monkey plasma. Similar metabolite profiles were observed in pooled monkey plasma after single dose and repeated dose. M8b was the only warhead-containing metabolite of ABBV-011 identified in monkey plasma.\nRadiolabeled Rat In Vivo Metabolism\nTwo major circulating metabolites were identified as M8b and M1. Radio profiling demonstrated that M8b represented 63.2% drug-related material (DRM), while M1 represented 24.9% DRM in circulation. Due to the use of a split-flow for collection of fractions for radioanalysis, MS sensitivity was limited. Consequently, the ABBV-011 metabolites detected in non-radiolabeled monkey and rat samples were not detected by LC-MS analysis of the radiolabeled samples. To supplement radiochromatography data, synthetic M8b, M1, and diamine-calicheamicin standards were analyzed by LC-MS with identical chromatography parameters in order to confirm structures by matching retention times. The retention times of M8b and M1 matched the major peaks observed in the radiochromatogram, while diamine-calicheamicin eluted at an earlier retention time than any observed peaks.\nThis article has not been copyedited and formatted.

Therefore, M8b and other related metabolites are estimated to be below LOD in the pooled plasma sample.\nThe retention times observed and calculated molecular ion masses, and mass error for the synthetic standards are included in Supplemental Table 3.

            "text": "These experiments revealed that disulfide bond cleavage is a significant factor accounting for loss of conjugated N-acetyl-\u03b3-calicheamicin and a resulting reduction in DAR. This highlights the importance of carefully monitoring the stability of the disulfide bonds in other calicheamicin ADCs and preclinical ADCs. It may also suggest that linker designs that do not rely on disulfide bonds may be a more stable alternative for ADC design.\nWe found little information on the stability of the DMH-calicheamicin disulfide bond or the mechanism by which payload is released from GO or IO. The general assumption is that the acid-labile linker is hydrolyzed slowly over time at plasma pH. (Fu et al., 2022)(Wolf et al.)(Jabbour, Paul, & Kantarjian, 2021; Su et al., 2021) However, our data would suggest disulfide cleavage is the leading mechanism for release.\nConceptually, ABBV-011 internalizes and degrades in the lysosome to release calicheamicinSH, M8a, or M8b. Calicheamicin-SH, M8a, or M8b would then enter the nucleus and bind to DNA. M8a or M8b would then be reduced to the common calicheamicin-SH intermediate, which would then undergo Bergman cyclization generating the diradical which would lead to cleavage of the DNA and cell-death. Detection of M1 does not necessarily verify the Bergman cyclization occurred interchelated to the DNA,(Myers, Cohen, & Kwon, 1994) but detection of M1 is required to verify successful cleavage of the DNA and efficacy of the ADC. The presence of M8a or M8b however, is indicative of a failure of some of the ADC to generate DNA scission.\nOur results suggest that in vivo, a dominant pathway for ABBV-011 degradation in plasma involves reduction of the disulfide bond in the linker-drug, followed by cysteinylation of the linker (Figure 6). When ABBV-011 is incorporated into a tumor cell, it is transported to the lysosome, upon which the ADC is cleaved and calicheamicin material is released. Formation of M8a is favored over M8b in the lysosome due to the acidic conditions. M6 is also released in the\nThis article has not been copyedited and formatted.

In vivo efficacy demonstrates that the lysosome is also responsible for ultimate appearance of active forms of calicheamicin in the nucleus (disulfide clipped or forms released by disulfide bond reduction of M8b) and induces double-strand DNA scission and cell death. Some ABBV-011 molecules are removed from circulation by the liver, upon which M1 and M3 are released, suggesting that ABBV-011 may be releasing active calicheamicin which may damage liver cells and cause toxicity. These observations are supported by in vivo cyno plasma metabolite analysis, which identified M8b and M3 in circulation.\nMinimal toxicity was observed with dosing of the M8b metabolite to rats, suggesting that M8b must not be entering the nucleus, interchelating with DNA, and cleaving the DNA via Bergman cyclization diradical. One possible explanation is that M8b is poor at permeating the nuclear membrane. It\u2019s also unlikely that M8b was generated extracellularly since it\u2019s more likely the disulfide would clip in this environment, as demonstrated by our characterization of the intact ADC in plasma (Figure 4). Therefore, DNA cleavage is likely driven by calicheamicin-SH release via a mechanism independent of M8b formation.\nWe have also learned that N-acetyl-\u03b5-calicheamicin (M1) is unstable and further metabolizes to release M3. N-acetyl-\u03b5-calicheamicin has not been reported as a catabolite of GO or IO; although it has been stated that N-acetyl-\u03b5-calicheamicin could not be separated from N-acetyl\u03b3-calicheamicin using a legacy enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) bioanalytical method.(Kirkovsky, 2016) The only published step taken to stabilize calicheamicin ADCs is optimization of the GO conjugation process to limit aggregation of the final product for clinical use.(Hamann et al., 2002) This resulted in a product with a range of DAR with an average of 2- 3, with approximately 50% of the antibody unconjugated.(Bross et al., 2001) It is unclear if this observed propensity for aggregation is related to instability of the payload molecule.\nThis article has not been copyedited and formatted.

Our initial radiolabeled ABBV-011 rat experiments appeared to suggest that M8b is 2.5x more abundant than M1 in circulation. However, as M3 was not resolved in this LC-MS analysis, this ratio could not be accurately assessed. Future characterization of ABBV-011 should prioritize optimal chromatographic resolution of M8b, M1, and M3.\nThese results suggest that more work must be done to understand how calicheamicin is trafficked across the cell, from the lysosome, and into the nucleus. One example of this type of investigation were conducted on ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1, trade name: Kadcyla), an ADC indicated for treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer.(Verma et al., 2012) While Kadcyla is conjugated with DM1 rather than calicheamicin, it merits mention in this discussion as one of the key ADC studies that has looked at trafficking of the drug of an ADC.(Liang, Mei, Gao, Peng, & Zhan, 2021; Sang et al., 2021)\nDuring the course of this work, it was discerned that N-acetyl-\u03b3-calicheamicin is light sensitive. Protecting ABBV-011 and unconjugated linker-drug from light exposure were found to correlate with reducing aggregation, maintaining in vitro cell killing potency, and stabilizing the linker disulfide bond. Fluorescent light was found to have cause fewer liabilities than natural light, indicating that N-acetyl-\u03b3-calicheamicin is most sensitive to light wavelengths of <400 nm. These precautions to protect ABBV-011 samples from light played an important role in the response to early observations of a disconnect between TAb and conjugated ADC PK in vivo. Light protective precautions were included for subsequent in vivo bioanalysis, to improve the overall stability of ABBV-011.
