    "abstractText": "As a type of aggregation-induced emission (AIE) fluorescent probe, tetraphenylvinyl (TPE) or its derivatives are widely used in chemical imaging, biosensing and medical diagnosis. However, most studies have focused on molecular modification and functionalization of AIE to enhance the fluorescence emission intensity. There are few studies on the interaction between aggregationinduced emission luminogens (AIEgens) and nucleic acids, which was investigated in this paper. Experimental results showed the formation of a complex of AIE/DNA, leading to the quenching of the fluorescence of AIE molecules. Fluorescent test experiments with different temperatures proved that the quenching type was static quenching. The quenching constants, binding constants and thermodynamic parameters demonstrated that electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions promoted the binding process. Then, a label-free \u201con-off-on\u201d fluorescent aptamer sensor for the detection of ampicillin (AMP) was constructed based on the interaction between the AIE probe and the aptamer of AMP. Linear range of the sensor is 0.2\u201310 nM with a limit of detection 0.06 nM. This fluorescent sensor was applied to detect AMP in real samples.",

            "text": "Twenty years ago, Tang\u2019s research group found a new class of organic molecules which had almost no emission in dilute solutions, but strong fluorescence emission in an aggregate or solid state, which they termed aggregation-induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) [1]. AIE molecules could avoid concentration quenching or aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) of the conventional fluorophores [2]. Therefore, AIEgens molecules have been used to construct chemicals and biosensors [3], bioimaging probes, and have been widely applied in various fields over the past twenty years [4]. As typical AIE dyes, tetraphenylethene (TPE) and its derivatives have been widely used to construct fluorescent sensors and biological probes [5,6]. Li and coworkers [7] developed a fluorescent aptasensor for the detection of exosome tumor-associated proteins, combining aptamers, tertiary amine-containing tetraphenylethene, and graphene oxide (GO) as recognition units, fluorescent probe, and the quencher, respectively. Numerous AIE molecules could bind to the aptamer and form aggregates rapidly, leading to an amplified fluorescence intensity. Zhu et al. [8] constructed a label-free and turn-on AIE-based fluorescence aptamer sensor for the detection of mycotoxin. Hu [9] prepared AIE-Red and AIE-Green fluorescence probes, using the same TPE cores functionalized with the positively charged morpholine groups or vinyl pyridinium. With only one excitation laser, this strategy can facilitate the multicolor monitoring of mitochondria and lysosomes, respectively. Xu et al. [10] reported a TPE-based fluorescent probe by decorating carboxylate coordination groups on TPE for\nBiosensors 2023, 13, 504. https://doi.org/10.3390/bios13050504 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/biosensors\nBiosensors 2023, 13, 504 2 of 11\nthe highly selective and sensitive detection of nitrofuran in aqueous solution. Because TPE molecules are insoluble in water, most of the reports focused on functional modification of the TPE core skeleton to enhance its practicability which led to the complex molecular structures of TPE derivatives, with complex synthesis steps and a high cost [11\u201313]. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new sensitive and accurate biosensors with simple molecule probes without complex functionalization in the TPE-based fluorescence sensing systems. Aptamer is a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), RNA, or modified nucleic acid isolated through SELEX technology, and can specifically bind to corresponding targets, for example, small organic molecules, viruses or proteins with high affinity and selectivity [14,15]. Aptamer-based sensors (Aptasensor) have been widely reported and developed in recent years [16\u201319]. AIE molecules, generally having a positive charge, would tend to bind to negatively charged aptamers, and the fluorescence emission varies with the change of the molecular aggregation state [8,20]. Zhang et al. [21] developed a turn-on fluorescent sensor for the detection of chloramphenicol in which an AIE 9,10-distyrylanthracene derivative with short alkyl chains and GO function as the fluorescent probe and the fluorescence quencher, respectively. However, the interaction between AIEgens and DNA strands has been rarely reported. To illustrate the binding mechanism of AIEgens to DNA, the interactions between the amino group functionalized TPE (TPE-Am) and singlestranded DNA were studied in this paper. The binding types, constants and types of force were investigated. Experimental results showed that the binding modes between AIE molecule and DNA were intercalation and groove binding. Fluorescent test experiments under different temperatures proved that the quenching type was a static quenching. The quenching constants, binding constants and thermodynamic parameters demonstrated that electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions promoted the binding process. Antibiotics are generally used to treat infections caused by pathogenic bacteria or fungi in healthcare. However, the overuse of antibiotics may lead to food and environmental pollution [22\u201324]. Ampicillin (AMP) is widely used to manage and treat certain bacterial infections. Therefore, it is very important to detect AMP residues in natural environments and foodstuffs for human health protection. Up to now, various detection methods such as chromatography, microbiological assay, electrochemical and photochemical sensors have been developed to detect antibiotics [25\u201330]. Chromatography has great advantages on selectivity; however, it requires professional instruments and cumbersome pretreatment. Sensitivity and specificity of microbiological assay for the detection of antibiotics is not enough. In spite of high detection sensitivity, electrochemical sensors are prone to contamination and have poor reproducibility. Compared with other detection methods, photochemical sensors, especially fluorescent sensors for the detection of antibiotics, have received more and more attention in recent years. However, most of the detection methods need fluorescent labeling which are time-consuming and costly. Therefore, it is urgent to develop a simple, fast and inexpensive detection method for AMP. Based on the aforementioned developments, in this paper we developed a simple, label-free fluorescent aptasensor, with high specificity and sensitivity, to detect AMP using the AIE probe based on interaction between AIEgens and the aptamer of AMP."

(C) Stern\u2013Volmer plots for the TPE-A /DNA system with differen temperatures.\n3.2.1. Quenching Mechanism of Fluorescence\nDynamic or static quenching mechanisms could be judged from constants Kq and Ksv at different temperatures. Because of its dependance on diffusion effects, Kq and Ksv were larger with increasing temperature. However, non-fluorescing complexes were produced during static quenching process, leading to decreasing static quenching constants with increasing temperature [34,35]. Next, the fluorescence quenching tests were carried out at a temperature of 287, 305 and 318 K between TPE-Am and the aptamer of AMP, respectively, which are shown in Figure 2B. The KSV and Kq values were calculated according to Equation (1) and are exhibited in Table 1. The experimental results demonstrated a classical static quenching process for TPE-Am binding to DNA strands, as the values of Kq were much larger than 2 \u00d7 1010 L\u00b7mol\u22121s\u22121 which was the maximum scattering collision quenching constant. The\nBiosensors 2023, 13, 504 5 of 11\nKsv values decreased with increasing temperature; furthermore, the dynamic quenching constant was generally less than 100 L\u00b7mol\u22121.\n1 R is the correlation coefficient.\n3.2.2. Binding Constants\nFor the static quenching process, the binding constant (Kb) and the number of TPEAm-bound sites (n) per DNA strand could be determined from Equation (2).\nlg F0 \u2212 F\nF = lgKb + nlg[Q] (2)\nParameters F0, F and [Q] express the same meanings as in Equation (1). Kb and n could be obtained from the intercept and slope by plotting lg [(F0 \u2212 F)/F] against lg [Q] (intercept = lgKb, slope = n) (Figure 2C), and the values of Kb and n are listed in Table 2. The value of Kb decreased with increasing temperature according to Table 2 which was in accordance with Ksv, showing moderate binding between TPE-Am and DNA, and that TPE-Am/DNA complex might be formed [36]. The values of n are equal to approximately 1, indicating that there was one class of binding sites for TPE-Am in DNA.\n3.2.3. Thermodynamic Constants\nIt is well known that the four major interaction forces between small organic molecules and biomacromolecules are electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic force, and van der Waals force, respectively. The enthalpy change (\u2206H) of the interaction usually remains stable if the temperature does not change much. For small molecules binding to DNA, the interaction types and modes can be estimated by thermodynamic parameters, including free energy change (\u2206G), enthalpy change (\u2206H), and entropy change (\u2206S), according to Equations (3) and (4):\nln K = \u2212\u2206H RT + \u2206S R\n(3)\n\u2206G = \u2212RT ln K = \u2206H \u2212 T\u2206S (4)\nwhere K is the binding constant (Kb) at 287, 305 and 318 K, respectively, and R is the gas constant which is 8.314 J mol\u22121\u00b7K\u22121. The corresponding values were obtained from Equations (3) and (4) and listed in Table 2. The electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions were the main interaction force between TPE-Am and DNA, judging from the negative \u2206H and positive \u2206S value [37]."

There was strong fluorescence in 99% PBS (PBS:DMSO, v:v) because of the hydrophobicity of TPE-Am. In the presence of the aptamer of AMP (Apt), the weakened fluorescence intensities of the system was the result of the hydrophobic interaction between the TPE-Am probe and DNA (from on to off). However, the fluorescence recovered once the target AMP molecules were introduced into the solution (from off to on). As is well known, the force between the target and the aptamer is much larger than the hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. Fluorescence recovery came from the release of the TPE-Am probe because of the formation of an Aptamer-AMP complex. Therefore, the detection of AMP can be realized by monitoring the changes of the fluorescence intensities using this on-off-on fluorescent aptamer sensor.\nBiosensors 2023, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 11 ln H SK RT R \u0394 \u0394= \u2212 + (3) lnG RT K H T S\u0394 = \u2212 = \u0394 \u2212 \u0394 (4) where K is the binding constant (Kb) at 287, 305 and 318 K, respectively, and R is the gas constant which is 8.314 J mol\u22121\u00b7K\u22121.

There was strong fluorescence in 99% PBS (PBS:DMSO, v:v) because of the hydrophobicity of TPE-Am. In the presence of the aptamer of AMP (Apt), the weakened fluorescence intensities of the system was the result of the hydrophobic interaction between the TPE-Am probe and DNA (from on to off). How ver, the fluorescence recov red nce the target AMP molecules were introduced into he solution (from off to on). As is well known, the force between the target and the aptam r is much larger than the hydro n bonds and hydrophobic interactions. Fluorescence recovery came from the release of the TPE-Am probe because of the formation of an Aptamer-AMP complex. Therefore, the detection of AMP can be realized by monitoring the changes of the fluorescence intensities using this on-off-on fluorescent aptamer sensor.\nScheme 1.

Experimental results showed that the amino group functionalized TPE could combine with DNA by intercalation and groove binding force. Binding and thermodynamic constants demonstrated that the fluorescence quenching mechanism of the TPE molecule by DNA is a static quenching procedure and that the electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions were the main driving force between TPE-Am and DNA. Based on the above, a sensitive and label-free \u201con-off-on\u201d fluorescent aptamer sensor for AMP detection was developed. The sensor has a linear range of 0.2\u201310 nM with a limit of detection of 0.06 nM.
