            "text": "Employment programs are a central component of programming offered at Clubhouses;the accreditation standards for Clubhouses include four standards pertaining to employment. Employment programs offered include the work-ordered day where members and staff work alongside each other to complete the day-to-day operations of the Clubhouse (McKay et al., 2018), as well as three employment programs 1) transitional employment; (2) supported employment; and (3) independent employment opportunities (ICCD, 2015). The work-ordered day involves members voluntarily joining units and departments of the Clubhouse to improve their social and cognitive skills (Pernice et al., 2020). Members are able to choose both the departments and staff members they would like to work with. The workordered day typically operates during the weekdays from 9am to 5pm, helping members establish a routine corresponding to employment hours.\nTransitional employment (TE) refers to time-limited parttime opportunities (Mckay et al., 2018), generally involving 12 to 20 h a week for a period of 6 to 9 months (ICCD, 2015). Clubhouses work to maintain relationships with employers, provide training, onsite support, and coverage by a Clubhouse member or staff when members are absent. Members can participate in as many TE opportunities as they need, and the employers allow Clubhouses to decide who will fill TE positions, as Clubhouses \u201cown\u201d these positions (Mckay et al., 2018). The TE program includes significant support, both at work and outside of work, from Clubhouse staff. It acts as a rehabilitation program where members can gain the skills and confidence needed to obtain a job in the \u201creal world\u201d (ICCD, 2015). At the end of the transitional employment term, members can pursue another transitional employment placement or independent employment. In contrast, supported employment programs involve helping clubhouse members receive successful employment at a local business or public employer. Supported employment (SE) is not time-limited and can include part-time or full-time positions where Clubhouses provide support on or off-site if the member requires it. Although Clubhouses have relationships with the employers in the SE programs, these jobs are not \u201cowned\u201d by the Clubhouse and there is a competitive aspect to the interviewing process. Other employment programs are similar to the Clubhouse SE program, such as the individual placement and support model (IPS). Similar to the Clubhouse supported employment program, the IPS model provides individuals with job support to participate in competitive employment. Participating in\nemployment serves as a component of psychological treatment and provides individuals with support to seek out jobs and maintain that support once individuals are employed (Rodevand et al., are ready (ICCD, 2017). Finally, independent employment (IE) involves helping Clubhouse members seek out and obtain jobs on their own when they are ready (ICCD, 2015). Independent employment involves no formal relationship between employers and Clubhouses. Accordingly, there is no onsite support, meaning that members who participate in IE have gone through a fully competitive interview (Mckay et al., 2018). Clubhouses will often postIE positions for their members to apply."

            "heading": "Outcomes of Clubhouse Employment Programs",
            "text": "Research has documented that participation in Clubhouse employment programs is associated with increases in positive wellbeing outcomes and employment outcomes. Gold et al. (2016) found that members who participated in supported employment programs at Clubhouses reported greater quality of life and increases in self-esteem compared to unemployed Clubhouse members. Further, Clubhouse members who participated in employment programs were found to be employed for longer durations and earned more on average, as compared to those in an alternative mental health-based program (Schonebaum et al., 2006; Macias et al., 2006). Additionally, members who reported higher rates of participation in the work ordered day prior to being employed also tended to be employed for more extended periods, indicating that the work- ordered day was positively impacting member\u2019s subsequent employment success (Schonebaum et al., 2012). Similarly, a study in China found that Clubhouse members had higher employment rates after six months than participants in a general community service group (Chen et al., 2020).\nAn 18-month longitudinal study showed improved employment outcomes across time points for Clubhouse members (Bouvet et al., 2021). Qualitative analysis indicated that employment was one of the main reasons members joined the Clubhouse, and members relied on Clubhouses for support in order to pursue employment (Bouvet et al., 2021). In addition, TE programs help members determine their work capacity, encourage members to pursue future education and new opportunities, which leads to increased social inclusion (Pirttimaa & Salovitta, 2009). Thus, there is a solid research base for the effectiveness of Clubhouse employment programs on a variety of member outcomes."

Across Canada, many Clubhouses closed their in-person services and reported several challenges including increased mental health symptoms, loneliness, difficulty accessing services, and establishing routine due to the disruption of the work ordered day (Mutschler et al., 2021). Clubhouses rushed to adapt their programming to meet new needs created by the pandemic by expanding their meal programs, increasing communication through outreach programs, and delivering programming through virtual means (Mutschler et al., 2021). In addition, members who were engaged with their Clubhouses reported greater well-being over time (Hinchey et al., 2021). Despite rapid innovations in program delivery, Clubhouses faced many challenges with continuing the employment programs, due to the COVID-19 restrictions required by employment partners (e.g., reduced capacity, closure, Provincial Health Protocols, PPE compliance)."

Given that employment is a core component of the Clubhouse model of psychosocial rehabilitation, the present study seeks to understand the impact of COVID-19 on the employment rates of Clubhouse members. Furthermore, since the pandemic disproportionately impacted employment rates in marginalized groups, examining employment rates among individuals with mental health concerns would allow Clubhouses to determine which members were impacted by the pandemic and how to adapt their future programming and services.

The findings suggest that when Clubhouse members do not have access to employment programs, employment rates decrease. This is consistent with previous findings that indicate that the employment rates of individuals with mental health disabilities are about half the rate of individuals without mental health-related disabilities in Canada (Statistics Canada, 2020b). Employment programs at Clubhouses are able to address the reduced rate of employment for individuals with mental health symptoms and allow for their members to obtain employment while still being supported if symptoms worsen. Previous literature has noted that when individuals with severe or persistent illness receive employment services through mental health programs, they have greater rates of employment compared to individuals who received no employment services (Pandiani et al., 2004; Burns et al., 2007). Meaningful employment is seen as a central component of recovery (Pandiani et al., 2004). As such, providing funding for supported employment programs for individuals with psychiatric disabilities in order to achieve competitive employment is integral, as well as supporting businesses to join and participate with these programs.\nQualitative research has found that Clubhouse members experienced increased mental health symptoms, as well as isolation and loneliness, during the pandemic (Mutschler et al., 2021). Mental health declines were observed even in the general population, among individuals without mental illness (Swaziek et al., 2020). In Canada, the pandemic exacerbated mental health symptoms for individuals already experiencing poor mental health prior to the pandemic, in part due to loss of employment and inadequate financial resources (Statistics Canada, 2020b). Additionally, those unemployed at the start of the pandemic reported the greatest declines in mental health (Statistics Canada, 2020b). The COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately impacted marginalized communities who lacked power, agency, and social protections, such as individuals who could not work from home or were employed in precarious employment (Basu, 2021). Given the unequal impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on marginalized groups, the present study showcases the importance of employment programs for individuals with mental illness who are disproportionately impacted by economic downturns.\nClubhouses offered significant support to their members during the COVID-19 pandemic by rapidly adapting\noverall sample can be found in Table 1 and demographics by employment type can be found in Table 2. Demographics of participants were similar across the employment types.

This rate dropped across the time points, with rates provided in Table 2."

Future studies are needed to determine the impact of various government income relief programs during the pandemic. Further, additional employment outcomes (e.g., hours worked) during the pandemic may be important to understand how members were impacted during this time. Finally, an important future direction is to examine Clubhouse employment outcomes after the pandemic, to determine the impact of Clubhouse employment programs on various psychosocial recovery outcomes of Clubhouse members. This is an integral area of future research, as past qualitative studies have noted that due to the pandemic, Clubhouses will be \u201cforever changed\u201d (Mutschler et al., 2021)."

            "text": "Individuals with mental illness experience lower rates of employment, despite a desire to work (Nordt et al., 2012). The findings of the present study demonstrate that lower rates of employment among individuals experiencing mental illness was exacerbated due to the closure of Clubhouse employment programs. Despite this, it is important to note that Canadian Clubhouses rapidly adapted much of their programming and maintained a connection with their members to mitigate the negative effects of the pandemic on their members (Mutschler et al., 2021). While limitations exist, including the lack of data on hours worked and average income, the study provides insight into the employment rates of Canadian Clubhouse members during the pandemic. Despite the overall decrease in employment across the pandemic, members continued to work, demonstrating the resilience of Clubhouse members and the strength of Clubhouse employment programs in supporting members to develop the skills necessary to maintain stable employment. Implications of the present study suggest that Clubhouses and their employment partners must continue to adapt and find novel ways in which to provide employment opportunities for Clubhouse members. This may include remote employment positions to allow Clubhouses to continue their employment programs and provide new employment opportunities to members despite restrictions in the workplace. Remote employment is able to offer greater flexibility and their programming (Mutschler et al., 2021). They were able to successfully adapt a significant amount of their programming to be offered virtually and continue to support member\u2019s well-being (Mutschler et al., 2021; Hinchey et al., 2021). Specifically, Clubhouses implemented various policies such as increasing communication and outreach with members throughout the pandemic, expanding their meal programs and delivering their programming virtually, through services such as Zoom and Facebook (Mutschler et al., 2021). Despite these adaptations, offering employment programs during the pandemic was found to be difficult, due to employment partner\u2019s changing their policies of in-person work. Thus, there were fewer employment opportunities available to members during the pandemic, which may have contributed to the decline in supported employment rates. Interestingly, while rates of transitional and supported employment decreased, rates of independent employment increased. This increase in independent employment could have been due Clubhouses increasing virtual programming during the closure of their typical employment program. Anecdotal evidence from Clubhouse directors revealed that some Clubhouses provided virtual sessions on vocational skills such as building resumes and job applications leading members to seek out independent employment (C. Habal-Brosek, personal communication, January 3, 2022). Further, the skills that were previously developed through supported employment programs may have led members to seek out additional independent employment opportunities. This may explain why rates of independent employment remained consistent while transitional and supported employment decreased. Additionally, the rise in independent employment may have been due to the changing nature of the labor market, where there was an increase in remote employment over the course of the pandemic (Ameri & Kurtzberg, 2022; Lisa et al., 2021), which may have better fit the needs of some Clubhouse members due to its greater flexibility (Lisa et al., 2021). In light of previous findings where Cubhouse employment programs are able to increase member\u2019s employment durations and earnings, as well as the greater quality of life (Gold et al., 2016; Schonebaum et al., 2012), Clubhouses may benefit from exploring ways in which they can assist members in obtaining employment during the pandemic, for example, through virtual opportunities. This is particularly relevant, given that Clubhouse members reported increased mental health symptoms during the pandemic (Mutschler et al., 2021) and employment outcomes have been shown to facilitate recovery outcomes such as increased self-esteem and reduced hospitalization and readmission rates (Gold et al., 2014, Burns et al., 2007).\n1 3\n528\nCommunity Mental Health Journal (2023) 59:523\u2013530\nIBM Corp.
