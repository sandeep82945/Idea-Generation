    "abstractText": "We present here the synthesis, chemical, and photophysical study of a series of three new copper halide derivatives, namely 2a\u2013c. They are all tetranuclear copper-iodide clusters of general formula [Cu(\u03bc3-I)P]4 consisting of a cubane-like {Cu4I4} motif and P = phosphine. They differ in the type of the phosphines used as ligands: a monophosphine with a single pendant ester unit (complex 2a), two pendant ester units (2b), and a diphosphine containing two esters in the linker (2c). The molecular structure of the complexes was determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. All the investigated derivatives were found to be photoand thermally-stable luminescent species. In the solid state, the complexes display intense and long-lived photoluminescence in the orange region with PLQY values of 0.43\u20130.84 at room temperature associated mainly with a 3CC excited state with mixed 3XMCT character.",

            "text": "Earth-abundant photo-active transition metal complexes are currently the subject of intensive research in inorganic photochemistry because of their potential applications in photocatalysis, solar energy conversion, and light emitting devices [1\u20135]. Among the metals studied, copper(I)-based emitters are certainly the ones that attract the most attention because of their many advantages. They are considered an attractive alternative to emitters containing platinum group metals for the development of (electro)luminescent materials [6\u201310] since copper is less toxic and cheaper than the latter. However, the photophysical properties of Cu(I)-based emitters remain inferior to those of platinum group based complexes mainly due to the smaller spin-orbit coupling exerted by the lighter metal elements, which scales roughly with the fourth power of the atomic number. Hence, increasing efforts are being made to improve the emission properties of copper-based complexes, primarily through the design and synthesis of copper-specific ligands that can control and enhance their photophysical properties. Thus, depending on the geometry, nuclearity, and electronic properties of the ligand surrounding the metal, copper complexes can exhibit emissions derived from different excited states, namely metal-ligand charge transfer (MLCT), halide-to-ligand charge transfer (XLCT) and cluster-centered (CC) [11]. Among all the recent developments, some Cu(I) complexes possess close-lying singlet and triplet manifolds with MLCT character (1,3MLCT) that enables thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) mechanism with interesting application in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) [12\u201317]. This prompts the study of the coordination chemistry of Cu(I) with the design of new ligands that can provide enhanced photophysical properties.\nSymmetry 2023, 15, 1210. https://doi.org/10.3390/sym15061210 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/symmetry\nSymmetry 2023, 15, 1210 2 of 12\nMultinuclear copper compounds bearing nitrogen or phosphorus ligands are also widely studied [11]. They present a polymeric or discrete structure typically formed by the assembling of {Cu2X2} or {Cu4X4} subunits. Copper-iodide tetranuclear clusters of the general formula [Cu(\u00b53-I)P]4, consisting of a {Cu4X4} core and apically located ligands, have attracted major attention due to their novel photophysics, including double emission from two electronically decoupled excited states, namely a high-energy (HE) 3XLCT state and a low-energy 3CC state (LE) [18]. In the search for new copper complexes of interest, we have recently shown that phosphine ligands, which differ only in minor chemical modifications can induce profound effects on solid-state emission properties, highlighting the importance of the microenvironment for the emitters in the aggregated phase [19,20]. In continuity, we studied the coordination chemistry of three phosphine ligands. Herein, the synthesis of a phenylphosphineand a diphenylphosphine ligand functionalized by ester moieties are reported along with their coordination on Cu(I) yielding photoactive cubane clusters. The ligands were easily obtained in one step through hydrophosphination reaction, and the corresponding copperiodide tetranuclear clusters featuring {Cu4X4} core were obtained by direct reaction with CuI and characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The photophysical properties in the solid state were also studied and hereafter presented."

            "text": "No emission was detected for solution samples at room temperature, as expected, owing to the flexible nature of the overall cubane Cu-I scaffold and dynamic ligand dissociation in such conditions [8,36]. In the solid state, all three complexes show one intense and structureless yelloworange photoluminescence with emission maximum centered at \u03bbem = 569, 575, and 578 nm for 2a, 2b, and 2c, respectively. Complex 2a is the most emissive amongst the series with photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) as high as 84% in neat powder (see Table 1 and Figure 6). Compounds 2b and 2c have slightly lower PLQY values of 43% and 50%, respectively. Despite the absence of cuprophilic interaction, no higher energy (HE) band is observed in the region at ca. 400\u2013480 nm surprisingly, as often observed for related cubane [Cu4I4L4] derivatives, where L is a either N- or P-based coordinated ligand, such as for instance substituted pyridine or phosphine [37,38]. Interestingly, time-resolved emission traces can be nicely fitted with mono-exponential decays providing an excited state lifetime in the range \u03c4 = 5.11\u20135.89 \u00b5s. Closer analysis of the excited-state kinetic parameters yields an stimated radiative kinetic constant, kr, of 8.4\u201316.2 \u00d7 104 s\u22121. The smaller v lue of the non-radiative rate constant, knr, was observed for derivative 2a and was 3.1 \u00d7 104 s\u22121, giving rise to the compoun with the highest PLQY value amongst the series. The linear n ture of the phosphine ligand in 2a seems to provide a less flexible and better packing motif in the solid state reducing the radiatio less deexcitati n pathways compared, for instance, to the compound bearing the bidentate diphosphine ligand, complex 2c. Overall, these findings allow us to ascribe the radiative process as originating from a single excited state with main triplet cluster-centered (3CC) with mixed copper-centered and triplet halide-to-metal charge transfer (3XMCT) character in accordance with previously reported derivatives [8,36\u201338].\nSymmetry 2023, 15, 1210 9 of 12\nTable 1.

The phosphines used are either monodentate or bidentate ligands and are characterized by the presence of ester functions [39]. The three complexes were fully characterized, including the determination of their molecular structure by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Of the three molecular structures, that of complex 2b is particularly remarkable, with the ligands arranged in high symmetry to give an overall D2d symmetry to the tetramer. Interestingly, compounds 2a and 2c crystallize in the low-symmetry space group P-1 (with apparently no relation to the molecular symmetry), while compound 2b crystallizes in the highly symmetric tetragonal space group P-4c2. In all three cases, the Cu-Cu intramolecular distance is greater than 2.95 \u00c5, which is greater than the sum of the van der Waals radii of 2.80 \u00c5. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) revealed that they are highly robust (Figures S10\u2013S12 in Supplementary Materials). The monodentate phosphine-stabilized complexes 2a and 2b show a weight loss of 5% at 253 and 252 \u00b0C, respectively, while complex 2c requires a temperature of 307 \u00b0C for the same weight loss, which could be correlated with the chelate effect of the diphosphine. All three cubanes are highly luminescent in the solid state but not in solution, which is typical for this class of Cu(I) compounds, with emission that is found to be relatively independent of the nature of the phosphine capping ligand (\u03bbem = ca. 570\u2013580 nm) and\nFigure 6.

O r studies also allow us to attribute radiative process as originating from a single xcited state with a mixed 3CC/3XLCT character. The presence of ester functions on the ligands could allow good formulation compatibility in organic polymers such as polyacrylates or polyurethanes, which can be a relevant strategy to design materials with enhanced functionalities [40\u201342].\nSymmetry 2023, 15, 1210 10 of 12"
