"Although value co-creation theory has been used in a variety of areas, such as healthcare, social media, travel, public services and retail [33â€“37], research on value co-creation in the live streaming platforms ecosystem is limited. Considering sustainable development, the platform will adopt rewards and punishment mechanisms for live streaming anchors and suppliers in live streaming. Under the strict supervision of the live streaming platform, live streaming anchors and suppliers will eventually choose to act in good faith driven by profits, thus, realizing value co-creation. Therefore, this study enriches the main content of live streaming and accelerates the value co-creation process in a live streaming ecosystem."
