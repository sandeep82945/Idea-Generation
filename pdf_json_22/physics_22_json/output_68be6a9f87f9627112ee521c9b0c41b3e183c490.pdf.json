    "abstractText": "We study the logarithmic correction to the scaling of the first Lee-Yang (LY) zero in the classical XY model on square lattices by using tensor renormalization group methods. In comparing the higher-order tensor renormalization group (HOTRG) and the loop-optimized tensor network renormalization (LoopTNR), we find that the entanglement filtering in LoopTNR is crucial to gaining high accuracy for the characterization of the logarithmic correction, while HOTRG still proposes approximate bounds for the zero location associated with two different bond-merging algorithms of the higher-order singular value decomposition and the oblique projectors. Using the LoopTNR data computed up to the system size of L = 1024 in the L\u00d7 L lattices, we estimate the logarithmic correction exponent r = \u22120.0643(9) from the extrapolation of the finite-size effective exponent, which is comparable to the renormalization group prediction of r =\u22121/16.",

            "text": "Tensor network calculation of the logarithmic correction exponent in the XY model\nSeongpyo Hong1 and Dong-Hee Kim1, 2, \u2217 1Department of Physics and Photon Science, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju 61005, Korea\n2School of Physics, Korea Institute for Advanced Study, Seoul 02455, Korea\nWe study the logarithmic correction to the scaling of the first Lee-Yang (LY) zero in the classical XY model on square lattices by using tensor renormalization group methods. In comparing the higher-order tensor renormalization group (HOTRG) and the loop-optimized tensor network renormalization (LoopTNR), we find that the entanglement filtering in LoopTNR is crucial to gaining high accuracy for the characterization of the logarithmic correction, while HOTRG still proposes approximate bounds for the zero location associated with two different bond-merging algorithms of the higher-order singular value decomposition and the oblique projectors. Using the LoopTNR data computed up to the system size of L = 1024 in the L\u00d7 L lattices, we estimate the logarithmic correction exponent r = \u22120.0643(9) from the extrapolation of the finite-size effective exponent, which is comparable to the renormalization group prediction of r =\u22121/16.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nMultiplicative logarithmic corrections appear in the critical behaviors of certain statistical physics models, introducing another set of scaling exponents characterizing criticality [1\u2013 3]. In the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition [4\u20137], the renormalization group (RG) equations predicted that the correlation function G(R) at the critical point exhibits the leading-order behavior of G(R) \u223c R\u2212\u03b7(lnR)\u22122r [7, 8] or more generally G(R) \u223c R\u2212\u03b7(b+ lnR)\u22122r [9] with exponents \u03b7 = 1/4 and r = \u22121/16 at a large distance R. The logarithmic correction factor essentially distinguishes the critical behaviors of the correlation function and susceptibility from those of the Ising model undergoing the second-order transition. On the other hand, it is numerically challenging to precisely identify such multiplicative logarithmic correction with a very small exponent. Much numerical effort has been devoted to measuring r in the two-dimensional (2D) XY model and related models undergoing the BKT transition [10\u201322]. While early estimates of r vary from positive to negative values (see Table 4 in Ref. [23]), later large-scale Monte Carlo (MC) simulations showed improved agreement with the RG prediction.\nIn previous MC studies of the 2D XY model, Kenna and Irving [10] firstly measured r =\u22120.02(1) from the finite-sizescaling (FSS) analysis of the lowest lying (first) Lee-Yang (LY) zero for system sizes up to L = 256 in the L\u00d7L square lattices. At the critical point, they found that the first LY zero \u03b81 should behave with increasing system size L as\n\u03b81 \u223c L\u03bb (lnL)r, (1)\nwhich was derived from its relation to the leading-order scaling behavior of the susceptibility,\n\u03c7 \u223c L\u2212d\u03b8\u221221 \u223c L2\u2212\u03b7(lnL)\u22122r, (2)\nwhere d = 2 for two dimensions and thus \u03bb = \u22122 + \u03b7/2. Using the Villain formulation, Janke [15] measured r =\n\u2217 dongheekim.gist.ac.kr\n\u22120.0270(10) from the FSS analysis of the susceptibility in the critical region for system sizes up to L = 512. Later, Hasenbusch [20] examined an alternative scaling ansatz of the susceptibility,\n\u03c7 \u223c L2\u2212\u03b7(C+ lnL)\u22122r, (3)\nreporting r = \u22120.056(7) from the FSS analysis with the MC dataset of 256 \u2264 L \u2264 2048 in the pure XY model. The hightemperature expansion done by Arisue [21] reported the similar value of r = \u22120.054(10) from the calculation of the moments of the correlation function. Most recently, Komura and Okabe [22] performed large-scale MC calculations for sizes up to L = 65536, reporting the best fit with r =\u22120.064(4) at the fixed value of C = ln16 in the FSS analysis of the susceptibility. The parameter C effectively includes subleadingorder corrections that may decay rather slowly with increasing L [20]. Setting C = 0 provided smaller values of r = \u22120.0406(3) in Ref. [20] and r\u2248\u22120.55 in Ref. [22] with similar system sizes.\nIn this paper, we revisit the FSS analysis of the first LY zero in the 2D XY model by employing methods based on the tensor renormalization group (TRG). Since the first MC measurement of the LY zero [10], there have been no other attempts to measure the logarithmic correction exponent using the LY zero in the XY model. Most of other previous estimates of r were based on the susceptibility that might have been more straightforwardly measurable in cluster MC simulations. The purpose of the present work is to examine applicability of the TRG-based methods to the numerical identification of the first LY zero and then to provide an updated estimate of the logarithmic correction exponent.\nThe TRG methods provide a deterministic way of evaluating the partition function of a classical spin model in the tensor network representation [24]. The higher-order tensor renormalization group (HOTRG) method [25] was previously applied to the Fisher zero problem where the partition function is evaluated at a complex temperature [26, 27]. In the Ising and Potts models, the HOTRG method was also used to obtain the density of the LY zeros from the discontinuity of magnetization [28]. While tensor network methods have been actively applied to study phase transitions in classical and quantum systems [29], including the BKT transitions [30\u201337], the ar X\niv :2\n20 5.\n02 77\n3v 2\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .s\nta t-\nm ec\nh] 1\n4 M\nay 2\n02 2\n2 computation of the first LY zero in the XY model has not been studied with TRG yet. It still remains unclear whether or not a TRG-based method such as HOTRG allows enough accuracy to characterize such delicate logarithmic correction with a small exponent predicted at the BKT transition.\nWe compare HOTRG with the loop-optimized tensor network renormalization (LoopTNR) [38] in identifying the location of the first LY zero at the critical point. It turns out that HOTRG fails to give a converged estimate at a large system, although it still proposes approximate bounds for the zero location that are set by the estimates associated with two different bond-merging algorithms based on the higher-order singular value decomposition [25] and the oblique projector method [39]. In contrast, the LoopTNR calculations show much better convergence with increasing the bond dimension cutoff, indicating the importance of removing the short-range entanglement [40]. We obtain the first LY zeros for system sizes up to L = 1024 in the XY model. In the analysis of the alternative scaling ansatz with an undetermined constant as being introduced in the susceptibility [20], we present that our finite-size estimate of the logarithmic correction exponent approaches closer to the RG prediction, providing the updated estimate of r =\u22120.0643(9) from extrapolation.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we describe the numerical procedures including a brief review of HOTRG and the two bond-merging algorithms and the performance of our initial state preparation for the loop optimization in the LoopTNR calculations. In Sec. III, we present the comparison between the two bond-merging algorithms of HOTRG and the estimate with LoopTNR in computing the first LY zero and the analysis of the LoopTNR data of the LY zero to measure the logarithmic correction exponent in the XY model. Summary and conclusions are given in Sec. IV."

XY model and Lee-Yang zeros\nThe classical XY model is described by the Hamiltonian,\nH =\u2212J \u2211 \u3008i, j\u3009 cos(\u03c6i\u2212\u03c6 j)\u2212h\u2211 i cos\u03c6i, (4)\nwhere \u03c6i is a spin angle at site i, and h denotes a magnetic field. The coupling strength J and the Boltzmann factor kB are set to be unity, and thus the temperature unit J/kB and the magnetic field unit J are omitted for brevity throughout this paper. We consider the periodic boundary conditions.\nThe zeros of a partition function provide an alternative tool to study phase transitions and critical phenomena (see, for instance, Refs. [41, 42] and references therein). The LY zeros [43, 44] are defined in the plane of complex fugacity while the Fisher zeros [45] are defined in the plane of complex temperature. Characterizing the BKT transition using partition function zeros has been interest of many previous works [10\u2013 12, 26, 27, 46\u201350]. In the models that satisfy the Lee-Yang theorem [44], including the XY model [51], the LY zeros are exactly on the imaginary axis of the magnetic field. The first\nLY zero is the one with the smallest magnitude, exhibiting a characteristic scaling behavior with increasing system size at the critical point.\nFinding the location of the LY zero requires the evaluation of the partition function Z = \u2211{\u03c6i} exp(\u2212\u03b2H) at an imaginary magnetic field h = i\u03b8 . In the XY model, we fix the inverse temperature \u03b2 at the critical point \u03b2c = 1.1199 that is agreed between the previous large-scale Monte Carlo [20, 22], hightemperature expansion [21], and tensor network renormalization [37] studies. To identify the first LY zero \u03b81, we first graphically locate an approximate location of \u03b81 and then numerically minimize |Z(\u03b2c,\u03b8)| to refine the estimate of \u03b81.\nIn the TRG formulation [24], the partition function of a classical spin model with local interactions is written in the square lattices as\nZ(\u03b2c,\u03b8) = Tr\u220f i Txix\u2032iyiy\u2032i , (5)\nwhere T is a local tensor, and its four legs are associated with the bonds in the x and y directions. In the XY model, the local tensor is given as [30, 52]\nTxx\u2032yy\u2032 = \u221a Ix(\u03b2c)Ix\u2032(\u03b2c)Iy(\u03b2c)Iy\u2032(\u03b2c) Ix+y\u2212x\u2032\u2212y\u2032(i\u03b2c\u03b8), (6)\nwhere In is the modified Bessel function of the first kind. While the exact enumeration of the tensor product in Eq. (5) is numerically impossible unless the system is very small, TRG provides a controlled way to compute Z by coarse-graining the tensor network with bond dimension truncation. Below we briefly describe the procedures of the two TRG-based methods that we employ to evaluate the partition function."

For instance, as shown in Fig. 1(a), one can write down the contraction of two neighboring tensors along the y direction as\nMxx\u2032yy\u2032 = \u2211 i Tx1x\u20321yiTx2x\u20322iy\u2032 , (7)\nwhere the bond dimension of x \u2261 x1 \u2297 x2 and x\u2032 \u2261 x\u20321 \u2297 x\u20322 increases to \u03c72 if each leg of T has dimension \u03c7 .

(b)\n(c)\nFIG. 1. Schematic diagram of (a) the combine tensor M in HOTRG, (b) the oblique projectors, and (c) the initial tensor preparation for the loop optimization in LoopTNR. In (c), thicker bonds have dimension as large as \u03c72 that is to be truncated by the projectors of the entanglement filtering.\nimaginary magnetic field, we perform the orthogonal transformation by diagonalizing the real part of MM\u2020 in the same way that was used in Refs. [26, 27] for the Fisher zero problem.\nThe other bond-merging algorithm [39] considers a pair of the oblique projectors P1 and P2 inserted between the neighboring combined tensors M1 and M2, as sketched in Fig. 1(b), minimizing ||M1M2\u2212M1P1P2M2|| at a given cutoff \u03c7 of the bond dimension between them. While details of the algorithm can be found in the literature [39, 53, 54], let us briefly review the numerical procedures.

            "text": "A known issue of TRG is that it does not make an isolated RG flow because of the survival of the short-range entanglement [40]. HOTRG is much more accurate than the original TRG at a non-critical region, but it also suffers from the same issue of the original TRG at a critical point, which may cause inaccuracy in finding the LY zero especially at a large system. Several methods [38, 40, 55\u201358] have been proposed to remove the short-range entanglement and demonstrated that a correct fixed point tensor is recovered with much higher accuracy at a critical point. So far, the effect of the entanglement filtering remains untested in the plane of a complex field or temperature for a partition function zero problem. In Sec. III, we will show that removing the short-range entanglement is crucial particularly to the identification of the multiplication logarithmic correction in the XY model.\nWe adopt the LoopTNR method [38] that extends the TRG scheme by adding the entanglement filtering step to remove the corner double line tensors and replacing the truncated SVD of the original TRG with the loop optimization. We have implemented our code by faithfully following the original paper [38] yet with extra care of preparing an initial tensor\n4 32 64 128 256 512 L 1.20 1.22 1.24 1.26 1.28 1.30 ln 1 ln L LoopTNR ( = 14) 2D Ising model = 14 (oblique) = 10 (oblique) = 8 (oblique) = 8 (HOSVD) = 10 (HOSVD) = 14 (HOSVD)\nFIG. 3. Comparison between HOTRG and LoopTNR in finding the first LY zero of the 2D Ising model at the critical point. Different cutoff values of the bond dimension (\u03c7 = 8,10,14) are examined with the HOSVD and oblique projector methods in the bond-merging step of HOTRG. The exponent \u03bb is fixed at \u221215/8. The dotted line indicates the exact scaling behavior.\nfor the loop optimization. It was already pointed out in the original paper that choosing a good initial tensor could considerably speed up the convergence of iterations in the loop optimization.\nThe simplest way of preparing an initial octagonal tensor ring for the loop optimization is to perform the truncated SVD as done in the original TRG scheme. Instead, as sketched in Fig. 1(c), we use the entanglement filtering algorithm to generate projectors to truncate the bond dimension. We first apply SVD to the local tensors with all singular values being kept and then perform the entanglement filtering on the eight-tensor ring. In the final step, the projectors are constructed by choosing the largest \u03c7 singular values. During the loop optimization, the entanglement filtering is performed every ten sweeps for better stability. The maximum number of sweep is limited to 200. Figure 2 presents comparison between two choices of the initial tensors, showing that the entanglement filtering projectors gains order-of-magnitude improvement over the simple truncated SVD in the minimization of the cost function."

While it fails to converge, the comparison between the estimates associated with the two bond-merging algorithms proposes the upper and lower bounds for the zero location. Second, LoopTNR converges much faster than HOTRG and thus provides a more reliable estimate of the zero location. The comparison between HOTRG and LoopTNR shows the importance of the entanglement filtering to the precise identification of the LY zeros in the XY model.\nFigure 3 displays the first LY zeros computed in the 2D Ising model. The LoopTNR calculations verify the exact scaling behavior \u03b81(L)\u221d L\u03bb with the critical exponent \u03bb =\u221215/8 at a relatively low cutoff \u03c7 = 14. On the other hand, the HOTRG calculations converge rather slowly with increasing \u03c7 , which gets worse as it goes to larger systems. Interestingly in the HOTRG calculations, the direction of the LY zeros moving toward the exact scaling line with increasing \u03c7 depends on which bond-merging algorithm is used. While the one with HOSVD approaches the exact scaling line of the first LY zero from above, the other with the oblique projectors lies below the exact line, proposing an area where the exact LY zero should be located. Although our observation is purely empirical, testing the different bond-merging algorithms may help judging the absolute convergence of the LY zero estimate. In the Ising model, one can simply increase \u03c7 to see that the two HOTRG estimates indeed meet each other on the exact scaling line for the system sizes shown in Fig. 3.\nFigure 4 shows the same tendency with the bond-merging algorithms of the HOTRG estimates in the XY model. The zero estimate moves with increasing \u03c7 from the opposite directions associated with the two bond-merging algorithms.

We fail to make these two HOTRG estimates meet together for L \u2265 16 even at the largest cutoff that we have examined. Thus, it is not practically possible to study the multiplicative logarithmic correction to the scaling of the LY zero by using the HOTRG calculations.\nIn contrast, the estimates of the LY zeros from the LoopTNR calculations with the cutoffs of \u03c7 = 60,70,80 graphically overlap onto each other. All are well within the bounds proposed by the HOTRG estimates. While the convergence with different \u03c7\u2019s is not perfect for the largest L as seen in the numeric data of the LY zeros listed in Table I, the larger bond dimension makes the less truncation error in building a coarse-grained tensor and should provide the more accurate data. Our measurements of the exponent r of the multiplicative logarithmic correction to the scaling presented below are mainly based on the data of the largest cutoff \u03c7 = 80 that we have managed to reach in our LoopTNR calculations."

The extrapolation along the line of reff(L,2L,4L) = r\u2217\u221e + a(lnL) \u2212\u03c9 is shown at the fitting parameter of \u03c9 = 5.79 obtained with the data point of L = 8 being excluded.\norder terms that decay with increasing L. This finite-size effect is expected to be particularly problematic when trying to identify the logarithmic correction exponent because its base is the logarithm of the system size. An ideal FSS analysis to determine the exponent r would need a dataset of very large system sizes, such as a series of log2 L = 2\nn, to perform a conventional log-log fit. However, the sizes allowed in our calculations are l \u2261 log2 L = 3,4,5, . . . ,10, implying that a significant finite-size effect could appear in the evaluation of the exponent.\nThe LoopTNR calculation is deterministic at a given bond dimension cutoff \u03c7 and free from a stochastic uncertainty. If the LoopTNR data of the first LY zero is precise enough, a good way to get an exponent can be extrapolating the finitesize exponents that are computed by equating r in Eq. (14) with two different system sizes. which is extrapolated toward the wanted exponent r in the thermodynamic limit. This method is sensitive to the accuracy of the raw data and thus typically used for numerically exact data at small systems. We write the finite-size exponent reff by choosing two consecutive system sizes of l and l +1 as\nreff(l) = ( log2 \u03b81(l +1)\n\u03b81(l) \u2212\u03bb\n)/ log2 ( 1+\n1 l\n) , (15)\nwhere \u03bb is fixed at \u221215/8. Supposed no numerical error existing in \u03b81(l), the finite-size behavior of reff(l) is solely due to the subleading-order contributions that decrease with increasing l, implying that reff monotonically approaches the exact value of the exponent r as l increases.\nFigure 5 presents reff(l) obtained from the two-point esti-\n6 L \u03c7 = 60 \u03c7 = 70 \u03c7 = 80 8 0.043152022481 0.043152341820 0.043152516125 16 0.011697992784 0.011698219091 0.011698141443 32 0.003171206193 0.003171237666 0.003171264869 64 0.000859814590 0.000859847214 0.000859849347 128 0.000233203560 0.000233203767 0.000233206505 256 0.000063265430 0.000063270187 0.000063270583 512 0.000017175547 0.000017171787 0.000017171295 1024 0.000004660332 0.000004663680 0.000004661544\nTABLE I.

It turns out that the data with the largest cutoff available (\u03c7 = 80) shows a smooth monotonic curve expected in this method while the less accurate ones with the lower cutoffs indicate deviations from the one with the largest cutoff at L = 512 and 1024. We perform the extrapolation with the data of \u03c7 = 80 along the model line of\nreff(l) = r\u2217\u221e +aol \u2212\u03c9 , (16)\nfinding r\u2217\u221e = \u22120.0674(16). Although this number is close to the RG prediction rRG =\u22120.0625, we must point out the risks of such extrapolation. This extrapolation model assumes decay in the form of l\u2212\u03c9 , which lacks a theoretical ground. In addition, the available data points are quite far from the intercept at 1/l = 0 on the extrapolation line, implying that the intercept r may significantly vary with a choice of the model. While this issue is fundamental, we argue that it is less severe if we take the alternative ansatz with an undetermined constant.\nIn the FSS analysis of the BKT transition, the logarithmic correction is often described by (C + lnL) with an undetermined constant C instead of lnL [20, 59]. Similarly, we may write the system-size scaling ansatz of the first LY zero as\n\u03b81(L)\u223c L\u03bb (C+ lnL)r, (17)\nwhere the constant C may help us to include some of subleading-order contributions within the ansatz. To determine the two unknowns of reff and C, we need to consider three system sizes (l, l+1, l+2). The equation for c\u2261C/ ln2 is then written as\nlog2 \u03b81(l+1) \u03b81(l) \u2212\u03bb log2 \u03b81(l+2) \u03b81(l+1) \u2212\u03bb =\nlog2 [ 1+(c+ l)\u22121 ] log2 [1+(c+ l +1)\u22121] , (18)\nwhich is to be solved numerically. The right-hand side is a bounded and monotonic function of c, indicating that there exists a single solution or no solution. Once c is determined, the finite-size exponent reff can be computed as\nreff(l) = ( log2 \u03b81(l +1)\n\u03b81(l) \u2212\u03bb\n)/ log2 ( 1+\n1 c+ l\n) . (19)\nFigure 6 shows reff obtained from the three-point analysis of Eqs. (18) and (19). As one may have expected already in the\ntwo-point analysis, the datasets of \u03c7 = 60,70 having larger truncation errors do not give a solution of c at large L\u2019s. In contrast, the dataset of \u03c7 = 80 provides a solution for c at all l\u2019s examined. The three-point estimate of reff seems to saturate faster as l increases than the two-point estimate without C, which may be seen from the value of \u03c9 = 5.7 in the extrapolation along the line of Eq. (16), while it was \u03c9 = 0.541 in the case of the two-point analysis. The intercept r\u2217\u221e =\u22120.0643(9) is close to the data of reff =\u22120.0665 obtained at the largest l and is also well compared to the RG prediction.\nFinally, it is also worth to note that our dataset proposes a possible range of r without extrapolation being attempted. As displayed in Figs. 5 and 6, the two-point estimate of reff monotonically decreases with increasing l while the three-point estimate increases with l. The two curves have to meet at a true value of r in the limit of infinite l. Therefore, these monotonic yet contrasting behaviors of reff(l) observed in the two different analysis indicate that the exact r must be in the range of \u22120.0665 < r <\u22120.0403, where the numbers are given by reff at the largest l available in Figs. 5 and 6. This range is probably the most conservative measure of r that we can provide, although the power-law extrapolation suggests that the true r is likely to be much closer to the lower bound of the range."

            "text": "We have investigated the applicability of the TRG-based methods of HOTRG and LoopTNR to the calculation of the first LY zero, with a particular focus on the multiplicative logarithmic correction to the scaling at the critical point in the 2D XY model. It turns out that while LoopTNR exhibits graphical convergence in the LY zero location, HOTRG fails to provide a reliable estimate within our accessible bond dimension cutoffs, assuring the importance of the entanglement filtering in LoopTNR. Despite the failure of HOTRG, we have found that the opposite convergence directions associated with the two different bond-merging algorithms of HOSVD and the oblique projectors can propose the bounds for the zero location between which the LoopTNR estimate indeed resides.\nBy using the LoopTNR dataset of the first LY zeros, we have measured the logarithmic correction exponent r in the XY model. We have considered the finite-size effective exponent reff that is computed from a adjacent set of of the LY zero data. In the two-point and three-point analysis of reff based on the two types of a scaling ansatz, we have identified the range of \u22120.0665 < r < \u22120.0403 at the largest system size examined for the measure of the exponent. The extrapolation with the three-point estimates provides r\u2217\u221e =\u22120.0643(9) that is well compared to the RG-predicted value of r =\u22120.0625.\nOur estimates of r are based on the LoopTNR dataset of \u03c7 = 80 that is the largest cutoff accessible within our computing resources. The irregularity observed at the lower values of the cutoff implies that \u03c7 = 80 may be the minimum bond dimension cutoff for LoopTNR to achieve enough accuracy required to the proper characterization of the multiplicative logarithmic correction. While it is computationally challenging to increase \u03c7 further larger in the present study, our three-\n7 point analysis method of computing reff based on the ansatz of Eq. (17) can be a benchmark for future tensor network calculations at larger values of \u03c7 to pursue a more precise measurement of the logarithmic correction exponent in the XY model and other systems undergoing the BKT transition."
