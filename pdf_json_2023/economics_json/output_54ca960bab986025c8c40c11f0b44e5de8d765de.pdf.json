    "abstractText": "Sharing systems have facilitated the redistribution of underused resources by providing convenient online marketplaces for individual sellers and buyers. However, sellers in these systems may not fully disclose the information of their shared commodities, due to strategic behaviors or privacy concerns. Sellers\u2019 strategic information disclosure significantly affects buyers\u2019 user experiences and systems\u2019 reputation. This paper presents the first analytical study on information disclosure and pricing of competing sellers in sharing systems. In particular, we propose a two-stage game framework to capture sellers\u2019 strategic behaviors and buyers\u2019 decisions. Although the optimization problem is challenging due to sellers\u2019 nonconvex and non-monotonic objectives, we completely characterize the complex market equilibria by decomposing it into several tractable subproblems. We demonstrate that full disclosure by all sellers or non-disclosure by all sellers will both lead to intense price competition. The former all-disclosure case is never an equilibrium even when all sellers have good commodity qualities and low privacy costs, while the latter non-disclosure case can be an equilibrium under which all sellers get zero profit. We also reveal several critical factors that affect sellers\u2019 information disclosure. Interestingly, sellers\u2019 sharing capacity limitation and buyers\u2019 estimation biases encourage information disclosure as they mitigate sellers\u2019 competition.",

Background and Motivations\nTHE past few years have witnessed the fast-growing ofsharing systems, such as network sharing (e.g., leftover mobile data trading [2], [3] and user-provided networks [4], [5]), accommodation sharing (e.g., Airbnb [6] and HouseTrip [7]), and labor sharing (e.g., TaskRabbit [8]). In these systems, the sellers can profit from sharing their underused resources (such as network resources, houses, and personal time), and buyers can pay to access these resources through mobile phones [9]. A common practice in sharing systems is that sellers display commodity information and announce the prices, and buyers make choices accordingly [10]. For example, in the network sharing systems (such as BeWiFi [5]), sellers with leftover network resources can upload descriptions (e.g., mobile network operators, network conditions, and locations)\nNingning Ding is with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.\nZhixuan Fang is with Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, and Shanghai Qi Zhi Institute, Shanghai, China.\nJianwei Huang is with the School of Science and Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, China and the Shenzhen Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for Society (AIRS) (e-mail: jianweihuang@cuhk.edu.cn, corresponding author).\nto demonstrate their commodity qualities and attract buyers, and buyers can purchase suitable resources. Due to buyers\u2019 mobility, it is difficult for buyers to precisely know sellers\u2019 commodity quality, and thus buyers rely heavily on sellers\u2019 disclosed information to make purchase decisions.\nHowever, sellers may not be willing to show all their information for some reasons such as strategic behaviors and privacy concerns. First, strategic sellers can manipulate the display effects of commodities (which will affect buyers\u2019 perceptions) by controlling the degree of information disclosure [11]. Specifically, by disclosing information, a seller can display his competitive quality or distinguishing features to attract buyers when competing with other sellers. Meanwhile, the seller can also intentionally hide some unfavorable information from buyers, e.g., a host can conceal a photo of the living room which has a window facing a busy (hence potentially noisy) street. Second, as information can be widely spread, e.g., forwarded and shared through the mobile networks, social media, and social networks, sellers may have privacy concerns when sharing personal properties to strangers [12]. In sharing systems, sellers are often individuals instead of companies, commodities are often personal idle assets/service rather than industrial products, and sellers still use the sharing resources by themselves occasionally. Thus, information disclosure in sharing systems is always accompanied by privacy disclosure, such as the locations in network sharing, home details in accommodation sharing, and personal information in labor sharing, which explains sellers\u2019 incomplete disclosure behaviors [13].\nHence, buyers usually have limited information about the qualities of commodities in sharing systems. They have to make decisions based on their observation and estimation, i.e., observe what sellers show and estimate what sellers do not show based on their beliefs. Although some studies (e.g., [14]) show that the public review is also an important source to know the qualities of commodities, some literature (e.g., [15], [16]) reveals that reviews on social networks are always over-positive or uninformative. Moreover, for the fresh sellers in the system or changeable commodities (e.g., unused network resource), the reviews are not helpful enough. Thus, as a critical approach for buyers evaluating the commodities, sellers\u2019 information disclosure levels directly and significantly affect buyers\u2019 user experiences and systems\u2019 overall reputation [17]. We will focus on studying the impact of sellers\u2019 information disclosure in this paper, assuming that they have\nar X\niv :2\n30 8.\n16 32\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.G T\n] 3\n0 A\nug 2\n02 3\n2 similar reputations (i.e., public perception from buyers)1. Understanding the key factors of sellers\u2019 information disclosure can facilitate sharing systems\u2019 incentive mechanism design, credibility evaluation, and user loyalty improvement [18]. However, few results have been provided in literature to elaborate the influencing factors of sellers\u2019 disclosure behaviors in sharing systems. A recent numerical study indicates that house quantity negatively moderates sellers\u2019 information disclosure intentions in a sharing system [12]. Nevertheless, the impact of such capacities on sellers\u2019 information disclosure strategies has not been analytically studied. Moreover, sharing systems have recently released some new regulations on quality improvement and capacity limitation. For example, Airbnb has launched the Airbnb Select program to improve property qualities [19] and has restricted hosts from renting out multiple properties in some areas [20]. It is not clear yet what impact these regulations will have on sellers\u2019 information disclosure. Therefore, this paper will also study the impact of some key factors on sellers\u2019 optimal information disclosure decisions.\nB. Model and Problem Formulation We consider a general sharing system where sellers and buyers are individuals, which applies to a broad range of sharing scenarios. In such a sharing system, each seller decides the disclosed information about his shared commodities and sets a price. Each buyer compares the displayed information and prices of the sellers, and makes a choice among the sellers to maximize his expected payoff. In this paper, we would like to answer the following key questions: \u2022 How do privacy-sensitive sellers disclose information under\ncompetition in sharing systems? \u2022 How is sellers\u2019 optimal information disclosure affected by\nthe factors such as sellers\u2019 commodity qualities, privacy costs, capacity limitation, and buyers\u2019 estimation biases?\nC. Contributions To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that conducts an in-depth theoretical analysis of sellers\u2019 information disclosure and price competition in sharing systems. We summarize our key contributions as follows: \u2022 We propose a game-theoretic model to characterize the\ninteractions between sellers and buyers under incomplete information disclosure in sharing systems. The model captures both buyers\u2019 decision processes (observation and estimation) and sellers\u2019 strategic behaviors (trade-offs between the commodity display effects and privacy concerns). \u2022 We solve a challenging non-convex optimization problem involving piece-wise functions derived from the two-stage game, and give a complete characterization on the complex structure of equilibria under different conditions. \u2022 We reveal the relationship between information disclosure and price competition. The results show that full information disclosure by all sellers is never an equilibrium due to fierce price competition, even if all sellers have good commodity qualities and low privacy costs. Meanwhile, non-disclosure by all sellers leads to intense price competition and makes\n1We will consider more complicated interactions between sellers\u2019 disclosure strategies and buyers\u2019 reviews in a dynamic environment in future work.\nthem get zero profit, which happens when each seller has a poor commodity quality or an unaffordable privacy cost. \u2022 We characterize the key factors of sellers\u2019 disclosure strategies. Limited sharing capacities and the existence of buyers\u2019 estimation biases lead to less intense competition among sellers as well as more information disclosure in systems; high commodity qualities and low privacy costs also encourage sellers\u2019 information disclosure.\nD. Related Work Our paper is mostly related to the following two distinct strands of literature. 1) Sharing Systems: Studies in sharing systems have sprung up in recent years. Those related studies on the economics aspects of sharing systems have focused on several key issues such as incentives (e.g., [21], [22]), pricing (e.g., [23], [24]), throughput (e.g., [25], [26]), subsidization (e.g., [27], [28]), popularity prediction (e.g., [29]), and matching (e.g., [30], [31]). Some of them also considered two-stage Stackelberg games under incomplete information but focused on different research problems from ours (e.g., [21], [22]). In particular, Vivek et al. [10] and Xu et al. [32] numerically investigated how sellers\u2019 strategic signals impact buyers\u2019 renting decisions on Airbnb though empirical data. However, there does not exist a comprehensive analytical study on this issue yet. We provide a complementary view to fill this gap in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first attempt that analytically studies sellers\u2019 information disclosure in sharing systems, which provides a clear understanding regarding the observations in the related numerical studies [10], [32].\n2) Information Disclosure under Competition: Although there is a rich body of literature on sellers\u2019 information disclosure, the research about sellers\u2019 information disclosure under competition has only recently emerged with several modeling limitations. Some studies assumed that the buyers are homogeneous (e.g., [33], [34]) or disclosure is costless (e.g., [35], [36]). Only a few of them considered the uncertainty of buyers\u2019 decisions, albeit in different ways from this work (e.g., [35]\u2013 [38]). A widely adopted setting is the two-seller setting which is less general than the models with multiple sellers (e.g., [33], [34], [36]\u2013[38]). Many works used static models, but multi-stage dynamic models are closer to natural processes of interactions among users (e.g., [34], [35]). Moreover, there is a lack of analytical research about the impact of sellers\u2019 capacity limitation on their disclosure strategies. Although some models used the signaling game which can also capture the interaction process (e.g., [38]), those work did not consider many other aspects of our problem setting (e.g., capacity limitations or multiple sellers). As an attempt to generalize these diverse models, we incorporate all these factors in our model, which is summarized in Table I. As we shall see in next section, our model also captures the unique features of sharing systems, such as users\u2019 interaction processes and privacy concerns.\nFurthermore, there has been a heated debate about the disclosure strategies of sellers in competition. Some works (e.g., [33], [34]) showed that competing sellers will fully disclose information if there is no cost. However, empirical studies (e.g., [43]) indicated that sellers may withhold information\n3\nif they perceive strong competition. A number of analytical studies also pointed out that competitive pressures between sellers can undermine the full disclosure result, and only high-quality sellers disclose information (e.g., [36]). Moreover, some studies took a different view that no disclosure by any seller may be the unique outcome even if disclosure cost vanishes (e.g., [40]). Our paper provides more general analysis that captures these results as special cases and completely characterizes the different equilibria under various conditions.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. We describe the system model in Section II. We first consider a basic setting with two sellers and one buyer in Section III. In Section IV, we analyze the more general case with multiple sellers and buyers, taking sellers\u2019 capacities into consideration. Finally, we conclude in Section VI."

            "text": "We consider a sharing system where sellers rent out the same type of idle resources2 for monetary reward and buyers pay to access the resources according to their needs. In Sections II and III, we first consider the case where the system consists of two sellers (seller 1 and seller 2) and one buyer. The true quality of seller i\u2019s commodities (service) is denoted by Qi (i \u2208 {1, 2}), which is exogenously determined. Without loss of generality, we assume that seller 1 provides higher quality commodities than seller 2, i.e., Q1 \u2265 Q2 \u2265 0.\nThe two-seller setting is widely adopted by literature (e.g., [33], [36], [41]). The one-buyer setting is equivalent to the case where multiple heterogeneous buyers come to the system one at a time when sellers have unlimited capacities. We will further study the general case with N sellers and K buyers in both unlimited and limited capacity scenarios in Section IV.\nA. Strategies of Sellers and Buyers 1) Sellers\u2019 Information Disclosure and Pricing: As a common policy of sharing systems, each seller needs to decide how much private information (e.g., workers\u2019 educational levels, rooms\u2019 decoration styles) of his commodities to disclose (to buyers) and what commodity price to set.\nWe let \u03b1i \u2208 [0, 1] denote the seller i\u2019s disclosure level, i.e., the fraction of seller i\u2019s disclosed private information. The case of \u03b1i = 1 means that seller i discloses all the private\n2As a concrete example, a buyer visiting a city at a specific time wants to book an apartment in a specific area in an accommodation sharing system. In this case, the same type of resources mean that the apartments of competing sellers have the same properties in terms of available time and location. Hence, these apartments are substitutes for each other.\ninformation and shows the true quality to buyers3. The case of \u03b1i \u2208 (0, 1) means that seller i voluntarily discloses part of his information. The case of \u03b1i = 0 means that seller i discloses minimum information according to the regulation of the system. However, for the convenience of presentation, we describe \u03b1i = 0 as no disclosure throughout this paper. When making decisions on information disclosure, each seller has a trade-off between the commodity display effect for attracting buyers and the privacy loss brought by such disclosure. Thus, sellers may adopt incomplete information disclosure strategies, e.g., a worker on TaskRabbit may just sketch his educational experience to protect his privacy and conceal the unfavorable information. As the first attempt to understand such a tradeoff, we assume that buyers can infer the sellers\u2019 information disclosure levels through observations4.\nBesides choosing the information disclosure level, each seller i also needs to choose a price pi for his commodities. Setting a high price will decrease the competitiveness of the seller, while setting a low price may make the seller unprofitable.\n2) Buyers\u2019 Choice: The buyer compares the expected qualities of the commodities provided by the two sellers as well as the corresponding prices, and then chooses the seller that gives her maximum payoff (defined in Section II-B). We assume that the true qualities of sellers satisfy the buyer\u2019s minimum requirement and the buyer only buys one commodity from the chosen seller.\nB. Buyers\u2019 Payoff When the buyer chooses seller i \u2208 {1, 2}, the buyer\u2019s payoff is the difference between her expected commodity quality provided by the seller and her payment to the seller.\nThe expected commodity quality depends on seller i\u2019s information disclosure strategy: \u2022 If seller i fully discloses his information, then the buyer\nknows that she will experience the true quality Qi5. \u2022 If seller i discloses no information, then the buyer perceives\nthe quality only by her estimation Q0 + \u03f5. Here, constant Q0 is buyers\u2019 average prior belief on sellers\u2019 qualities when the sellers do not disclose information. Random variable \u03f5 indicates the bias of the buyer\u2019s estimation. We assume that \u03f5 obeys a uniform distribution, i.e., \u03f5 \u223c U(\u2212\u03f50, \u03f50), where \u03f50 is the maximum deviation from the average prior belief on quality and is assumed to satisfy \u03f50 \u2264 Q0/3.6\n3We assume that the disclosed information is real and thus reflects the true quality, because sharing systems usually impose severe penalties on sellers who disclose fake information [44], [45].\n4A seller\u2019s disclosure level can be observed consistently by all buyers. For example, suppose that there are five pieces of information about network sharing that sellers can choose to disclose, including the name of the network operator, the total network bandwidth, the total network coverage, the average signal quality, and the average network delay. If a seller only posts the information about coverage and delay on his website, then we can treat the seller\u2019s information disclosure level as \u03b1 = 0.4.\n5We assume that buyers\u2019 different preferences (e.g., on decoration style of houses) do not affect their perception on sellers\u2019 qualities.\n6This assumption is not restrictive. First, it is reasonable that buyers in the same sharing system have similar estimation on unknown commodity qualities. Second, literature shows that there is a pull-to-center effect of people\u2019s estimation, i.e., the estimated values of the majority (71% [46], 76.2% [47]) are the middle values.\n4 \u2022 If seller i partially discloses his information, the buyer\u2019s expected quality is modeled as \u03b1iQi+(1\u2212\u03b1i)(Q0+\u03f5). For the revealed part (fraction \u03b1i), the buyer observes quality Qi; while for the unobservable part (fraction 1 \u2212 \u03b1i), the buyer estimates the quality with (Q0 + \u03f5). Hence, when the buyer chooses seller i, the buyer\u2019s payoff\nis as follows:\nUi = \u03b1iQi + (1\u2212 \u03b1i)(Q0 + \u03f5)\u2212 pi, i \u2208 {1, 2}. (1)\nOne can also understand the \u03b1i as the weight/probability of the buyer believing in the sellers\u2019 displayed quality. Then, Equation (1) means that more disclosed information (i.e., a larger \u03b1i) will increase the buyer\u2019s belief in the commodity quality and reduce buyers\u2019 own estimation. Such a linear expected commodity quality in (1) is also used by recent studies [48], [49], showing that individuals are likely to estimate the unknown details based on their own knowledge/experiences rather than the advertised part. Such a behavior of distrust is natural in sharing systems, since the commodities are from various and strategic individual sellers [50]\u2013[52].7 Note that the buyer has a reservation payoff of zero, i.e., if all sellers offer the buyer negative payoffs, she will exit the market.\nC. Sellers\u2019 Profits\nEach seller\u2019s expected profit is the difference between his expected income charged from the buyer and his privacy cost.\nSpecifically, a seller\u2019s expected income is the product of the price and the probability of winning the buyer. When facing a buyer with an estimation bias of \u03f5, seller i\u2019s winning probability is jointly determined by the strategies of all sellers, and is denoted by Pri(\u03b1,p, \u03f5) \u2208 [0, 1], where \u03b1 = (\u03b11, \u03b12) are sellers\u2019 disclosure levels and p = (p1, p2) are their prices. \u2022 If seller i gives the buyer a higher payoff, then Pri(\u03b1,p, \u03f5) = 1, i.e., seller i wins the buyer. \u2022 If seller i offers the buyer a lower payoff, then Pri(\u03b1,p, \u03f5) = 0, i.e., seller i loses the buyer. \u2022 If two sellers give the same payoff, then Pri(\u03b1,p, \u03f5) = 0.5, i.e., tie breaks randomly. The disclosure of information induces privacy/information costs for sellers [53]. We assume that seller i\u2019s privacy cost is proportional to the private information disclosure level and is modeled as ci \u00b7 \u03b1i, where ci measures how seller i values his privacy. Such a linear privacy cost model has been widely used in literature (e.g., [54], [55]).8\nHence, when facing a buyer with an estimation bias of \u03f5, seller i\u2019s profit is summarized as follows9:\nWi(\u03b1,p, \u03f5) = pi \u00b7 Pri(\u03b1,p, \u03f5)\u2212 ci \u00b7 \u03b1i, i \u2208 {1, 2}. (2) 7The payoff function (1) can be generalized to the more practical case where sellers\u2019 displayed qualities deviate from the true qualities. Assume that seller i\u2019s displayed quality is (Qi+\u03b4) instead of Qi, where \u03b4 is the difference between the displayed quality and the true quality. Buyers do not know the value of \u03b4 and have to maximize the expected payoff. Their expected payoff is still (1) if \u03b4 is a zero-mean variable, i.e., E[\u03b4] = 0.\n8Information disclosure happens before the buyer purchasing the commodity, so sellers\u2019 information costs occur even if their commodities are not eventually sold.\n9Our model can be applied to the case where sellers\u2019 profits include an additional homogeneous service cost. Such a service cost will not affect the equilibrium results in this paper. Thus, we normalize it to zero.\nStage I: Sellers (as leaders) decide (a) their information disclosure levels \ud835\udf36\ud835\udf36 and\n(b) their prices \ud835\udc91\ud835\udc91 to maximize their own expected profits\nStage II: Buyers (as followers) decide which seller to choose to maximize their own payoffs\nFig. 1. The two-stage game. The buyer\u2019s estimation bias \u03f5 is a random variable that is unknown to sellers, so seller i has to maximize his expected profit:\nE[Wi(\u03b1,p)] = E\u03f5[pi \u00b7Pri(\u03b1,p, \u03f5)\u2212 ci \u00b7\u03b1i], i \u2208 {1, 2}. (3)\nSellers are involved in game theoretical interactions, as every seller\u2019s profit depends on all sellers\u2019 decisions.\nD. The Two-Stage Game We model the strategic interactions between sellers and buyers as a two-stage Stackelberg game. In Stage I, as the leaders, sellers simultaneously determine their information disclosure levels \u03b1 and announce the prices p to the buyers. In Stage II, as the follower, each buyer chooses one seller. Such a model is applicable to both Sections III and IV.\nThis two-stage game captures users\u2019 practical sequential interaction processes in sharing systems (Fig. 1). Specifically, sellers first show buyers their commodity information through photos and descriptions, which reflect their commodity qualities. They also announce the prices for their commodities. Hence, we model the sellers as the leaders in Stage I. After observing sellers\u2019 information and prices, each buyer will pay for a commodity from the seller who gives her the highest payoff. Thus, buyers\u2019 decisions are modeled in Stage II. Mathematically, Stage I is a non-cooperative game among sellers, as each seller\u2019s profit depends on both his strategies and also other sellers\u2019 strategies. In Stage II, as we consider buyers coming to the system one by one, so each buyer makes her own decision independent of other buyers.\nWe analyze the games between sellers as complete information games, i.e., the privacy costs and commodity qualities are known by all sellers (but not by the buyers)10. We use standard backward induction to analyze the dynamic game.\nNote that the analysis of Stage I is mathematically equivalent to sequentially optimizing the two variables in the backward induction. Specifically, sellers first simultaneously determine their information disclosure levels \u03b1 (a game of information disclosure) in Stage I-a, and then simultaneously announce the prices p to the buyers in Stage I-b (a game of pricing).\nFor the ease of reading, we list the key notations in Table II. In the following, we will first consider a basic setting where there are two sellers and one buyer. After that, we will further study the general case with many sellers and buyers.\n10Consider the example for accommodation sharing on Airbnb. Suppose that a buyer wants to compare sellers in a certain area. In reality, sellers usually have some knowledge about their neighbors\u2019 house (e.g., neighbors\u2019 house qualities, attitude/cost for information privacy) [56], [57]. The main reason is that sellers often have repeated interactions in the market, and as a result it is possible for them to learn each other\u2019s information over time, especially when the commodities are relative stable over time (such as the same houses). However, as the buyers are often one-time visitors to these areas, they do not know the seller\u2019s private information.\n5"

            "text": "In this section, we consider the basic setting with two sellers and one buyer in the system. We will use the backward induction to analyze the two-stage game, deriving the buyer\u2019s decision, sellers\u2019 prices, and sellers\u2019 information disclosure levels at equilibrium, respectively. After that, we study the factors that influence sellers\u2019 information disclosure.\nA. Buyer\u2019s Decision in Stage II In this subsection, we analyze the buyer\u2019s decision by comparing the payoffs of choosing different sellers. Specifically, the buyer will choose the seller i\u2217 who offers her a higher expected payoff in Stage II.\nRecall that the buyer\u2019s payoff is defined in (1). Therefore, the buyer\u2019s optimal choice i\u2217 is:\ni\u2217(\u03b1,p) = argmax i\u2208{1,2} \u03b1iQi + (1\u2212 \u03b1i)(Q0 + \u03f5)\u2212 pi. (4)\nIf the two sellers give the buyer the same payoff, the buyer will select each seller with an equal probability of 0.5.\nFor the convenience of presentation, we first introduce the following definition:\n\u03c8(\u03b1i, \u03b1j) \u225c \u03b1i(Qi\u2212Q0)\u2212\u03b1j(Qj\u2212Q0), i, j \u2208 {1, 2}, i \u0338= j. (5) The term \u03c8(\u03b1i, \u03b1j) is the difference of the buyer\u2019s expected qualities between choosing seller i and seller j under no estimation bias (\u03f5 = 0). When \u03c8(\u03b1i, \u03b1j) > 0, seller i gives the buyer a higher expected quality than seller j.\nThen, the probability of a seller being selected by the buyer is characterized by the following Lemma 1.\nLemma 1. Given a uniformly random estimation bias \u03f5 \u223c U(\u2212\u03f50, \u03f50)11, the probability of seller i being selected by the buyer is (i, j \u2208 {1, 2}, i \u0338= j):\nPri(\u03b1,p, \u03f5) =  0, if (\u03b1i \u2212 \u03b1j)\u03f5 > \u03c8(\u03b1i, \u03b1j)\u2212 (pi \u2212 pj);12 , if (\u03b1i \u2212 \u03b1j)\u03f5 = \u03c8(\u03b1i, \u03b1j)\u2212 (pi \u2212 pj); 1, if (\u03b1i \u2212 \u03b1j)\u03f5 < \u03c8(\u03b1i, \u03b1j)\u2212 (pi \u2212 pj).\n(6)\nProof of Lemma 1 is given in Appendix I. Lemma 1 shows that the buyer\u2019s decision heavily depends on the difference between two sellers\u2019 information disclosure levels (\u03b1i \u2212 \u03b1j) as well as the buyer\u2019s estimation bias \u03f5. \u2022 When seller i discloses less information than seller j\n(\u03b1i < \u03b1j), a larger \u03f5 helps increase seller i\u2019s winning probability. Estimation bias weakens the effectiveness of disclosed information. 11The analysis is similar if we consider a different distribution of the buyer\u2019s quality estimation bias \u03f5. The only difference is that when sellers calculated their expected profit, they need to take the expectation over a different distribution of \u03f5. The key insights will remain the same.\n\u2022 When two sellers disclose the same amount of information (\u03b1i = \u03b1j), the value of \u03f5 does not affect the buyer\u2019s decision. The buyer\u2019s decision is only affected by sellers\u2019 true qualities and prices, as she has the same uncertainty regarding the two seller\u2019s true qualities. Moreover, the value of \u03c8(\u03b1i, \u03b1j)\u2212(pi\u2212pj) is the difference between two sellers\u2019 expected quality gap and price gap. Seller i\u2019s winning probability increases with the expected quality gap and decreases with the price gap. Thus, whether a seller can win the buyer largely depends on two sellers\u2019 disclosure strategies in Stage I-a and pricing strategies in Stage I-b .\nB. Sellers\u2019 Pricing Competition in Stage I-b In this subsection, we analyze sellers\u2019 pricing strategies in Stage I-b. Given the information disclosure levels \u03b1 = (\u03b11, \u03b12) in Stage I-a, sellers need to decide their prices (p\u22171, p \u2217 2) under the uncertainty of \u03f5, considering the buyer\u2019s decision in Stage II.\nRecall that a seller\u2019s expected profit is defined in (3). Since the disclosure level \u03b1i is fixed in Stage I-b , seller i only needs to choose a non-negative price to maximize his expected profit. Formally, the Sellers\u2019 Pricing Game and the corresponding equilibrium are defined as follows.\nDefinition 1 (Stage I-b : Sellers\u2019 Pricing Game). \u2022 Players: seller 1 and seller 2. \u2022 Strategy space: each seller i \u2208 {1, 2} chooses his price pi \u2208 [0,\u221e). \u2022 Payoff function: each seller i \u2208 {1, 2} maximizes his expected profit E[Wi(pi; pj ,\u03b1)], where j \u2208 {1, 2}, j \u0338= i.\nDefinition 2 (Pricing Equilibrium in Stage I-b ). The equilibrium of the Sellers\u2019 Pricing Game is a profile (p\u22171, p \u2217 2) such that for each seller i \u2208 {1, 2}, E[Wi(p \u2217 i , p \u2217 j ;\u03b1)] \u2265 E[Wi(pi, p\u2217j ;\u03b1)], \u2200pi \u2208 [0,\u221e).\nIn other words, no seller wants to unilaterally change his pricing decision at an equilibrium. Next, we give the pricing strategies of two sellers at the equilibrium (p\u22171, p \u2217 2), which are the functions of the information disclosure levels (\u03b11, \u03b12).\nLemma 2. Given the information disclosure levels \u03b1 = (\u03b11, \u03b12), the equilibrium of the Sellers\u2019 Pricing Game (Stage I-b ) is: i) If \u03b11 \u0338= \u03b12,\n(p\u22171(\u03b1), p \u2217 2(\u03b1)) = (0,\u2212\u03c8(\u03b11, \u03b12)\u2212 \u03be), if \u03c8(\u03b11, \u03b12) \u2264 \u22123\u03be, ( 3\u03be+\u03c8(\u03b11,\u03b12)3 , 3\u03be\u2212\u03c8(\u03b11,\u03b12) 3 ), if \u22123\u03be < \u03c8(\u03b11, \u03b12) < 3\u03be,\n(\u03c8(\u03b11, \u03b12)\u2212 \u03be, 0), if \u03c8(\u03b11, \u03b12) \u2265 3\u03be,\nwhere \u03be \u225c \u03f50|\u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12|. ii) If \u03b11 = \u03b12 > 0, there is no pure strategy equilibrium.\niii) If \u03b11 = \u03b12 = 0, p\u22171 = p \u2217 2 = 0.\nProof of Lemma 2 is given in Appendix II. Here we list some interesting observations. \u2022 Fig. 2 shows sellers\u2019 optimal prices when they set different\ndisclosure levels (\u03b11 \u0338= \u03b12). If the expected quality gap is large (|\u03c8(\u03b11, \u03b12)| \u2265 3\u03be), the seller who offers a higher\n6\nexpected quality will set a positive price, and his competitor (the other seller) will set a zero price. If the expected quality gap is small (|\u03c8(\u03b11, \u03b12)| < 3\u03be), they will both set positive prices. We shall see in next subsection that the seller who sets a positive price has a positive expected profit; the seller who sets a zero price never discloses information and gets a zero profit. \u2022 Both sellers disclosing same amount of information (\u03b11 = \u03b12 = \u03b1 > 0) is never an equilibrium. If their disclosure levels are the same in Stage I-a, the difference of buyer\u2019s payoffs between choosing two sellers is U1\u2212U2 = \u03b1(Q1\u2212 Q2)\u2212 (p1 \u2212 p2). Since (without loss of generality we have assumed) Q1 \u2265 Q2, the ensuing price competition in Stage I-b will lead seller 2 to a zero price and a negative profit \u2212c2\u03b12, which is worse than no disclosure. \u2022 If no seller discloses information (\u03b11 = \u03b12 = 0), then U1\u2212 U2 = p2 \u2212 p1. There will be an intense price competition where both sellers set a zero price at the equilibrium. Note that sellers\u2019 pricing decisions depend on information disclosure levels, which will be analyzed in next subsection.\nC. Sellers\u2019 Information Disclosure in Stage I-a In this subsection, we study the sellers\u2019 information disclosure strategies in Stage I-a. Considering the pricing strategies in Stage I-b and the buyer\u2019s decision in Stage II, the sellers need to decide the information disclosure levels (\u03b11, \u03b12) in Stage I-a to maximize their expected profits.\nFormally, the Sellers\u2019 Information Disclosure Game and the corresponding equilibrium are defined as follows.\nDefinition 3 (Stage I: Sellers\u2019 Information Disclosure Game). \u2022 Players: seller 1 and seller 2. \u2022 Strategy space: each seller i \u2208 {1, 2} chooses his informa-\ntion disclosure level \u03b1i \u2208 [0, 1]. \u2022 Payoff function: each seller i \u2208 {1, 2} maximizes his\nexpected profit E[Wi(\u03b1i;\u03b1j)], where j \u2208 {1, 2}, j \u0338= i.\nDefinition 4 (Disclosure Equilibrium in Stage I). The equilibrium of the Sellers\u2019 Information Disclosure Game is a profile (\u03b1\u22171, \u03b1 \u2217 2) such that for each seller i \u2208 {1, 2},\nE[Wi(\u03b1 \u2217 i , \u03b1 \u2217 j )] \u2265 E[Wi(\u03b1i, \u03b1\u2217j )], \u2200\u03b1i \u2208 [0, 1].\nTo obtain sellers\u2019 expected profit function E[Wi(\u03b1i;\u03b1j)] in Stage I-a, we substitute the results of Stage II (Lemma 1) and Stage I-b (Lemma 2) into (3), as well as calculating the expectation over random bias \u03f5. It turns out to be a challenging optimization problem in Stage I-a due to sellers\u2019 complex non-convex objective functions (as shown in Equations (14) and (15) in Appendix III). The challenge is induced by i) the discontinuity of piecewise objective functions, ii) the coupling among decision variables (\u03b11, \u03b12) in a complex non-linear\nway, iii) uncertain monotonicity and convexity due to the uncertain numerical values of parameters Q1, Q2, c1, c2, Q0, and \u03f50. We solve the complex Stage I-a through properly decomposing it into several subproblems, so that the objective functions can de divided into analyzable convex or monotonic pieces.\nThere are different market equilibria under different conditions of sellers\u2019 marginal costs (c1, c2) and qualities (Q1, Q2). To capture these different cases, we first introduce sellers\u2019 behavior patterns which heavily depend on sellers\u2019 marginal costs (Section III-C1). Then, we show how sellers\u2019 qualities affect the appearance of these behavior patterns (Section III-C2).\n1) Behavior Pattern: Behavior pattern specifies the two sellers\u2019 information disclosure decisions at the equilibrium (\u03b1\u22171, \u03b1 \u2217 2).\nLemma 3. There exist four kinds of behavior patterns at the equilibrium:\n\u2022 Pattern I: there is a unique equilibrium (\u03b1\u22171, \u03b1 \u2217 2) = (1, 0). \u2022 Pattern II: there are two co-existing equilibria (\u03b1\u22171, \u03b1 \u2217 2) =\n(1, 0) and (\u03b1\u22171, \u03b1 \u2217 2) = (0, 1).\n\u2022 Pattern III: there is a unique equilibrium (\u03b1\u22171, \u03b1 \u2217 2) = (0, 1). \u2022 Pattern IV: there is a unique equilibrium (\u03b1\u22171, \u03b1 \u2217 2) = (0, 0).\nProof of Lemma 3 is given in Appendix III. These behavior patterns largely depend on sellers\u2019 marginal costs (c1, c2). In Pattern I, seller 1 fully discloses information while seller 2 does not disclose information, which usually happens when seller 1 (the higher-quality seller) has a small marginal cost (as we shall see in Fig. 3 in Section III-C2). In Pattern II, one of the sellers disclosing information is an equilibrium, which happens when seller 1 has a moderate marginal cost and seller 2 has a small marginal cost. In Pattern III, seller 2 fully discloses information while seller 1 chooses no disclosure, which happens when seller 1 has a large marginal cost but seller 2\u2019s marginal cost is small. In Pattern IV, no seller discloses information, which usually happens when they both have high marginal costs.\nAlthough different costs lead to different behavior patterns, some of the patterns do not exist under certain quality conditions (Q1, Q2). For example, as we shall see in Theorem 1, when both sellers have poor qualities, the equilibrium is (\u03b1\u22171, \u03b1 \u2217 2) = (0, 0) (Pattern IV) regardless of the costs (c1, c2), and the other three patterns I, II, III are not achievable. 2) Equilibrium Characterization: In the following, we characterize the equilibria by showing how the qualities affect the behavior patterns.\nTheorem 1. There exist four equilibrium structures, which are decided by sellers\u2019 qualities (Q1, Q2):\n\u2022 \u201cAll-Achievable\u201d: all patterns (I, II, III, IV) are achievable (Fig. 3(a))12.

Thus, since Q1 \u2265 Q2, there are six possible quality profiles (Q1, Q2) in total: GG, GM , MM , GP , MP , PP , which are also shown in Fig. 4.\nFirst, as shown in Fig. 4, when qualities (Q1, Q2) are given, the corresponding equilibrium structure belongs to one of the four cases. Second, as shown in Fig. 3, given the equilibrium structure, the equilibrium (i.e., behavior pattern) is uniquely determined by sellers costs (c1, c2). Sellers tend to not disclose information when the disclosure costs are unaffordable. Third, Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 show that Pattern II only happens when sellers\u2019 quality difference and costs difference are relatively small. Thus, sellers\u2019 strategies are more symmetric that either seller disclosing information is an equilibrium.\nWe can further derive the following insights about commodity qualities and sellers\u2019 disclosure strategies:\nObservation 1. i) A poor-quality seller will never disclose information, even if the disclosure is costless.\nii) If a medium-quality seller discloses information at the equilibrium, both sellers will have positive prices and positive expected profits.\niii) If a good-quality seller discloses information at the equilibrium, the other seller will choose a zero price and obtain a zero profit.\nWe further elaborate the Observation 1 in the following. (i) Such a non-disclosure situation exists in the profiles of GP , MP , and PP . This is surprising, as we would expect that a seller will disclose information when the privacy cost is zero. The reason that this is not in general true is that when the seller\u2019s quality is poor, disclosing information will decrease the buyer\u2019s payoff, which makes the seller less competitive. (ii) Since medium quality is close to the buyer\u2019s estimated quality, both sellers have positive expected probabilities to win the buyer and can expect positive profits. (iii) Since good quality is much higher than the buyer\u2019s estimated quality, if the seller who discloses information at equilibrium is of good quality, he will definitely win the competition and the other seller can only get a zero profit.\nThe results in this subsection show that information disclosure decision significantly depends on sellers\u2019 commodity qualities and privacy costs. Next, we will further explore other influencing factors of information disclosure.\nD. What Affects Information Disclosure?\nAccording to Sections III-A, III-B, and III-C, we can summarize the equilibria of the two-stage game in Appendix V, including the sellers\u2019 information disclosure strategies in Stage I-a, sellers\u2019 pricing decisions in Stage I-b , and the buyer\u2019s decisions in Stage II. These results reflect the relationship between price competition and information disclosure (Section III-D1). In addition, the relationship between the buyer\u2019s esti-\n8 mation bias and information disclosure is revealed in Section III-D2.\n1) Price Competition and Information Disclosure: There are certain cases where sellers do not disclose information, which reveal the relationship between price competition and information disclosure.\nProposition 1. Both sellers fully disclosing information is never an equilibrium.\nIt is natural to presume that sellers with good commodity qualities and low privacy costs will both choose to disclose information. However, Proposition 1 shows that full disclosure by both sellers will never be an equilibrium. The best response for seller 2 should be no disclosure when seller 1 chooses to disclose information. This is because as Q1 \u2265 Q2, both sellers fully disclosing information will lead to severe market competition, under which seller 2 will choose a zero price and hence obtains a negative profit \u2212c2. As this is worse than no disclosure, hence we have the conclusion in Proposition 1.\nMoreover, a seller does not disclose information when his cost is unaffordable or quality is poor. In this case the model degenerates to a pure price competition, as summarized in Proposition 2.\nProposition 2. When none of the sellers choose to disclose information, the game degenerates into a simple pricing competition, in which both sellers set the prices to zero and obtain a zero profit.\n2) Estimation Bias and Information Disclosure: To study the impact of the buyer\u2019s estimation bias on sellers\u2019 information disclosure, we further consider a benchmark case where the buyer has no estimation bias (\u03f50 = 0) in Appendix VI. Proposition 3 summarizes the comparison results:\nProposition 3. There are three key differences between the positive estimation bias (\u03f50 > 0) case and no estimation bias (\u03f50 = 0) case:\ni) The seller i whose quality is below average (Qi < Q0) never discloses information when \u03f50 = 0; but he may do so when \u03f50 > 0.\nii) The seller who does not disclose information earns a zero profit when \u03f50 = 0; but he may obtain a positive profit when \u03f50 > 0.\niii) It is never possible for both sellers to receive positive expected profits when \u03f50 = 0. However, it is possible when \u03f50 > 0.\nProposition 3 shows that the buyer\u2019s estimation bias mitigates market competition and encourages information disclosure. Specifically, (i) the estimation bias motivates the seller whose commodity quality is below average to disclose information; (ii) the estimation bias enables sellers who do not disclose information to achieve positive expected profits; (iii) the estimation bias makes it possible for both sellers to receive positive expected profits. Therefore, when there is an increasing heterogeneity of buyers in the system (and thus diverse estimation biases), e.g., when the system expands buyer\u2019s market, there will be more disclosure and less competition.\nAs a quick summary, we have shown that full disclosure or non-disclosure by both sellers will both cause intense price competition, but the existence of estimation biases can mitigate this effect. Next, we study whether above results still hold when the system consists of multiple users, and analyze how sellers\u2019 capacities affect market competition and information disclosure."

            "text": "In this section, we consider the more general case of a set N = {1, 2, ..., N} sellers and K = {1, 2, ...,K} buyers. To reveal the impact of sellers\u2019 capacities on information disclosure, we further analyze the equilibria where sellers have unlimited or limited capacities, respectively.\nWe still adopt the two-stage game model. Sellers make their information disclosure decisions and prices in Stage I. In Stage II, buyers come to the system one by one, and each buyer purchases one commodity from a seller with a spare capacity.\nWe make several assumptions. First, different buyers have different estimation biases, which are i.i.d., i.e., following the same distribution \u03f5k \u223c U(\u2212\u03f50, \u03f50),\u2200k \u2208 K. Second, since solving the non-convex optimization problem in the basic setting is already challenging, it\u2019s quite difficult to perform pairwise comparison for N sellers and then derive all sellers\u2019 pricing strategies as well as information disclosure levels. We can observe that although sellers\u2019 strategy space of information disclosure level is [0, 1] in the basic setting, the result at the equilibrium turns out to be either 1 or 0 (Lemma 3). Thus, to simplify the analysis, we assume that sellers\u2019 information disclosure strategy space is {0, 1} in this section.\nIn this case, the N Sellers\u2019 Information Disclosure Game and the corresponding equilibrium are13:\nDefinition 5 (Stage I-a: N Sellers\u2019 Information Disclosure Game). \u2022 Players: sellers in N . \u2022 Strategy space: each seller i \u2208 N chooses his information\ndisclosure level \u03b1i \u2208 {0, 1}. \u2022 Payoff function: seller i maximizes his expected profit E[Wi(\u03b1i;\u03b1\u2212i)], where \u03b1\u2212i \u225c (\u03b1k,\u2200k \u2208 N , k \u0338= i).\nDefinition 6. The equilibrium of the N Sellers\u2019 Information Disclosure Game is a profile \u03b1\u2217 = (\u03b1\u22171, ..., \u03b1 \u2217 N ) \u2286 {0, 1}N such that for each seller i \u2208 N ,\nE[Wi(\u03b1 \u2217 i ,\u03b1 \u2217 \u2212i)] \u2265 E[Wi(\u03b1i,\u03b1\u2217\u2212i)],\u2200\u03b1i \u2208 {0, 1}.\nIn the following, we will consider three possible scenarios of sellers\u2019 capacities (i.e., the number of buyers that sellers can serve).\ni) Each seller has an unlimited capacity. This is a reasonable approximation of the practical case where each seller has an enough capacity to serve all the coming buyers. For example, some sellers in an accommodation system own many properties or chain hotels.\n13As we mainly focus on studying sellers\u2019 information disclosure, the analysis of buyers\u2019 optimal strategies and sellers\u2019 optimal prices in this section are given in Appendices VII-X.\n9 ii) Each seller has a single capacity (one buyer per seller). This is motivated by the practical case where a worker in labor sharing systems can only serve one buyer at a time.\niii) Each seller has a limited capacity (multiple buyers per seller). This corresponds to the case where a seller can sell his leftover network resource to multiple buyers at the same time. The first and second scenarios can be regarded as special cases of this more general scenario.\nA. Unlimited Capacity In this subsection, we analyze sellers\u2019 information disclosure strategies under the scenario where each seller has an unlimited capacity. The analysis also serves as the benchmark for the limited capacity scenarios.\nWe denote by \u03a6eU the set of sellers who disclose information simultaneously at the equilibrium eU , where eU can be any possible equilibrium in the unlimited capacity scenario. Denote by |\u03a6eU | the number of sellers who disclose information at the equilibrium eU . Given the commodity qualities and privacy costs of sellers, there can be multiple co-existing equilibria. Theorem 2 shows that there are only two types of equilibria:\nTheorem 2. In the unlimited capacity scenario, the equilibrium always exists but may not be unique. There exist two kinds of equilibria:\ni) One-seller disclosure (i.e., |\u03a6eU | = 1) is the equilibrium if and only if at least one seller i \u2208 N has (Qi, ci) in one of the two cases in (7).\n1) Qi \u2208 (Q0 + \u03f50, Q0 + 3\u03f50) , ci \u2208 [ 0, (Qi \u2212Q0 + \u03f50)2\n8\u03f50\n] ;\n2) Qi \u2208 [Q0 + 3\u03f50,\u221e) , ci \u2208 [0, Qi \u2212Q0 \u2212 \u03f50] . (7)\nThe only seller i who discloses information at the equilibrium (i.e., \u03b1\u2217i = 1,\u03b1 \u2217 \u2212i = 0) has (Qi, ci) satisfying (7) and (8), Qi \u2265 Qj \u2212 cj ,\u2200j \u2208 N , j \u0338= i. (8)\nThe equilibrium is not unique when more than one seller has (Qi, ci) satisfying (7) and (8). Any such seller disclosing information while other sellers not is an equilibrium. ii) No disclosure is the equilibrium (i.e., |\u03a6eU | = 0) if and only if (Qi, ci) does not satisfy (7), for each seller i \u2208 N .\nProof of Theorem 2 is given in Appendix VIII. Theorem 2 shows that at most one seller discloses information at an equilibrium in the unlimited capacity scenario (i.e., |\u03a6eU | \u2264 1), which is a bit counter-intuitive. If more than one seller discloses information, all buyers will choose the seller who gives the highest payoff since the seller has an unlimited capacity. Thus, those unselected sellers who have disclosed information will obtain negative profits. It is impossible for two sellers who disclose information at the equilibrium to provide the same highest payoff for buyers, even if they have the same quality. A slight price reduction of one of the two sellers will attract all buyers, so they will keep decreasing their prices in the competition until one seller\u2019s profit is no larger than no disclosure. Hence, multiple sellers disclosing information cannot be an equilibrium in the unlimited capacity\nP M G\nQ0 \u2212 3\u01eb0 Q0 + \u01eb0 Q0 + 3\u01eb0\nc\nQO\nFig. 5. Illustration of (7): each seller with (Q, c) in the blue region is willing to disclose information when others do not.\nscenario. This is consistent with the basic setting (Proposition 1).\nMore importantly, Theorem 2 specifies which seller discloses information at an equilibrium in the unlimited capacity scenario. The condition (7) means that seller i is willing to disclose information when others do not. From the illustration of (7) in Fig. 5, we can observe that the sellers who are willing to disclose information have high qualities and low costs. The condition (8) ensures that seller j will not disclose information when seller i does, which requires the seller i who fully discloses his information at an equilibrium to have a quality substantially better than all other sellers.\nNext, we study the impact of capacities on sellers\u2019 information disclosure by considering the limited capacity scenario.\nB. Single Capacity (One Buyer Per Seller) In this subsection, we focus on the sellers\u2019 information disclosure strategies when each seller has a limited capacity and can only serve one buyer.\nSince we are studying sellers\u2019 strategies under competition, we assume that supply is larger than demand14. We denote by \u03a6eSO the set of sellers who disclose information simultaneously at the equilibrium eSO, where eSO can be any possible equilibrium in the single capacity (one buyer per seller) scenario15. Denote by |\u03a6eSO| the number of sellers who disclose information at the equilibrium eSO. Given the qualities and costs of sellers, there can be multiple co-existing equilibria. Theorem 3 shows that there are only two types of equilibria:\nTheorem 3. In the single capacity (one buyer per seller) scenario, the equilibrium always exists but may not be unique. There exist two kinds of equilibria:\ni) At the equilibrium, 1 \u2264 |\u03a6eSO| \u2264 K if and only if at least one seller i \u2208 N has (Qi, ci) satisfying (7). Each seller i \u2208 \u03a6eSO who discloses information at the equilibrium has (Qi, ci) satisfying both (7) and (9),\nQi \u2265 Qj \u2212 cj ,\u2200i \u2208 \u03a6eSO,\u2200j \u2208 N\\\u03a6eSO. (9)\nThe equilibrium is not unique when more than K sellers have (Qi, ci) satisfying (7) and (9). Any K of them disclosing information while other sellers not is an equilibrium. ii) At the equilibrium, |\u03a6eSO| = 0 if and only if (Qi, ci) does not satisfy (7), for each seller i \u2208 N .\n14The analysis of the scenario where supply is no larger than demand (i.e., no game among sellers) is given in Appendix XII.\n15Subscript SO represents single capacity (one buyer per seller), similarly in the following, subscript U represents unlimited capacity and subscript LM represents limited capacity (multiple buyer per seller).\n10\nProof of Theorem 3 is given in Appendix IX. Theorem 3 shows that at most K sellers fully disclose information at an equilibrium in this scenario, where K is the number of buyers. Each seller can serve one of the K buyers. If there are more than K sellers with full disclosure, the unselected sellers will get negative profits, which is worse than no disclosure. Hence, this will not happen at the equilibrium.\nMoreover, Theorem 3 identifies which sellers disclose information at an equilibrium in the single capacity (one buyer per seller) scenario. The results show that, in case (i), there is competition among the sellers, and those who eventually disclose information at an equilibrium need to have qualities significantly better than those sellers who choose not to disclose information (i.e., (9)). In case (ii), for any seller, disclosure leads to a lower profit than non-disclosure, so no seller will disclose information.\nFinally, we will consider the most general case where each seller can serve multiple buyers.\nC. Limited Capacity (Multiple Buyers Per Seller) In this subsection, we analyze the sellers\u2019 information disclosure strategies under the scenario where sellers have limited capacities and each seller can serve multiple buyers.\nLet \u03c9i \u2208 (1,+\u221e) denote the capacity of seller i. If \u03c9i = \u221e,\u2200i \u2208 N , it corresponds to the unlimited capacity scenario; If \u03c9i = 1,\u2200i \u2208 N , it corresponds to the single capacity (one buyer per seller) scenario. Since we are studying sellers\u2019 behaviors in competition, we still assume that supply is larger than demand in this subsection. We denote by \u03a6eLM the set of sellers who disclose information at the equilibrium eLM , where eLM can be any possible equilibrium in the limited capacity (multiple buyers per seller) scenario. Denote by |\u03a6eLM | the number of sellers who disclose information at the equilibrium eLM . Given the qualities and costs of sellers, there can be multiple co-existing equilibria. Theorem 4 shows that there are only two types of equilibria:\nTheorem 4. In the limited capacity (multiple buyers per seller) scenario, the equilibrium always exists but may not be unique. There exist two kinds of equilibria: i) At the equilibrium, 1 \u2264 |\u03a6eLM | < K if and only if at least\none seller i \u2208 N has (Qi, ci) satisfying (7). Each seller i \u2208 \u03a6eLM who discloses information at equilibrium has (Qi, ci) satisfying both (7) and (10).\nQi \u2265 Qj \u2212 cj ,\u2200i \u2208 \u03a6eLM ,\u2200j \u2208 N\\\u03a6eLM (10)\nThe equilibrium is not unique when the total capacity of a proper subset of sellers with (Qi, ci) satisfying (7) and (10) is larger than or equal to K. Any subset of these sellers with capacity satisfying (11) disclosing information while other sellers not is an equilibrium.\u2211\ni\u2208\u03a6eLM \u03c9i \u2265 K, (11a)\u2211 i\u2208\u03a6eLM \u03c9i \u2212 \u03c9j < K, j = arg min i\u2208\u03a6eLM {Qi \u2212 pi}. (11b)\nii) At the equilibrium, |\u03a6eLM | = 0 if and only if (Qi, ci) does not satisfy (7), for each seller i \u2208 N .\nProof of Theorem 4 is given in Appendix X. Theorem 4 characterizes the equilibria in the limited capacity (multiple buyers per seller) scenario and identifies which sellers disclose information at an equilibrium. In case (i), if the total capacity of sellers who are eligible to disclose information (i.e., satisfying (7) and (10)) is larger than the number of buyers K, the sellers who eventually disclose information at an equilibrium (i.e., sellers in \u03a6eLM ) will have exactly enough capacity for buyers. To be more specific, equation (11a) means that total capacity of the sellers in \u03a6eLM is no smaller than K. Equation (11b) means that at the equilibrium, without the seller who offers buyers the smallest payoff among the sellers in \u03a6eLM , the remaining sellers in \u03a6 e LM cannot serve all K buyers. One may presume that some sellers in \u03a6eLM may have some unsold capacity such that (11b) may not hold. However, it is impossible that there exist two sellers who disclose information and both have idle capacities, even if they have the same quality. Buyers choose sellers who offer higher payoffs to them, so two sellers having idle capacities means that they provide the same lowest payoff among disclosure sellers (i.e., mini\u2208\u03a6eLM {Qi \u2212 pi}) to buyers. A slight price reduction of one of the two sellers will attract the buyers who have chosen the other seller, so they will keep decreasing their prices in the competition until a seller\u2019s profit is no larger than no disclosure. In case (ii), no seller is willing to disclose information as all sellers have low qualities or high costs (i.e., not satisfy (7)).\nNext, we will compare the number of sellers who disclose information at equilibria in three capacity scenarios.\nD. Comparison of Information Disclosure in Three Scenarios In this subsection, we compare the results derived in the three capacity scenarios to explore the impact of capacity limitation on information disclosure.\nRecall that eU , eSO and eLM denote the equilibria under the three capacity scenarios, respectively. Moreover, |\u03a6eU |, |\u03a6eSO|, and |\u03a6eLM | are the corresponding numbers of sellers who disclose information at the equilibria. Based on Theorem 2, Propositions 3 and 4, we have the following relationship between capacity limitation and information disclosure:\nCorollary 1. For the same set of sellers and buyers, given any eU , eSO and eLM , the number of sellers who disclose information at the equilibrium satisfies |\u03a6eU | \u2264 |\u03a6eLM | \u2264 |\u03a6eSO|.\nProof of Corollary 1 is given in Appendix XI. Corollary 1 shows that more limited capacity allows more sellers to disclose information, encouraging the information disclosure in the system. Moreover, non-disclosure sellers will obtain a zero profit due to the fierce competition, so capacity limitation also enables more sellers to get positive profits, mitigating the market competition."

So far, we have derived the closed-form solutions to the equilibria under three capacity scenarios (Theorems 2, 3, and 4), and we have rigorously proved the relationship between sellers\u2019 capacities and information disclosure (Corollary 1).\n11\n5 10 15 20\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\nP M G\nQ\nc\n(a) Single Capacity Scenario (\u03c9 = 1)\n5 10 15 20\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\nP M G\nQ\nc\n(b) Limited Capacity Scenario (\u03c9 = 8)\n5 10 15 20\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\nP M G\nQ\nc\n(c) Unlimited Capacity Scenario (\u03c9 = \u221e) Fig. 6. Eligible region: sellers with (Q, c) in the blue region can disclose information at the equilibria.\nNext, we will give a concrete illustration through simulation. Since we study the competition among sellers, we set the number of sellers N = 200, which is larger than the number of buyers K = 32. As we assume that sellers\u2019 commodity qualities Q takes the values in [1, 20], we set buyers\u2019 average prior believe Q0 to be 10, which is the average commodity quality in the market. The estimation bias is \u03f50 = 2. The marginal privacy cost c in [1, 10] can capture different cases where sellers with high, medium, or low privacy concerns.\nAs shown in Fig. 6, we simulate three capacity scenarios, respectively. More specifically, \u03c9 = 1 is the single capacity (one buyer per seller) scenario, \u03c9 = 8 is the limited capacity (multiple buyers per seller) scenario, and \u03c9 = \u221e is the unlimited capacity scenario. The x-axis is the commodity quality and y-axis is the marginal privacy cost. The notations of \u201cP \u201d(poor),\u201cM\u201d(medium) and \u201cG\u201d(good) refer to the partition of sellers\u2019 qualities, which have been defined in Section III-C2. In each of the subfigures, the blue shaded area corresponds to the eligible region, within which each seller can be the seller who discloses information at equilibria. For example, any seller in the eligible region of Fig. 6(c) disclosing information and other sellers not is an equilibrium in the unlimited capacity scenario.\nFig. 6 shows that the sellers who can disclose information (i.e., in the eligible region) have high qualities and low marginal costs (as proved in Theorems 2, 3, and 4). Furthermore, larger capacities (i.e., larger \u03c9) require the sellers with full disclosure at an equilibrium to have higher (more competitive) qualities, corresponding to Q \u2265 12 in single capacity scenario, Q \u2265 17 in limited capacity scenario, and Q \u2265 19 in unlimited capacity scenario in Fig. 6. Therefore, as the sellers\u2019 capacities increase, a smaller number of sellers can disclose information at an equilibrium. This is consistent with our finding that larger capacity strengthens the competition among sellers and thus discourages the information disclosure.\nMoreover, this paper provides a clear understanding of the observations in previous numerical studies in literature and some system regulations in practice. For example, Xu et al. [32] numerically showed that extra information may exhibit a diminishing effect on buyer purchase behavior. This has been validated and explained by our paper that disclosing information is worse than no disclosure in some cases (Theorem 1). Airbnb has launched the Airbnb Select program to improve property qualities and has restricted hosts from renting out multiple properties in some areas [19], [20]. Both regulations eventually encourage sellers\u2019 information disclosure according\nto our analysis (Theorem 1 and Corollary 1). Overall, the results in this paper provide guidelines for sellers to optimize information disclosure behaviors in sharing systems. The results can also facilitate sharing systems\u2019 regulation decisions and incentive mechanism design."
