    "abstractText": "Articular cartilage injuries are inherently irreversible, even with the advancement in current therapeutic options. Alternative approaches, such as the use of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) and tissue engineering techniques, have gained prominence. MSCs represent an ideal source of cells due to their low immunogenicity, paracrine activity, and ability to differentiate. Among biomaterials, self-assembling peptide hydrogels (SAPH) are interesting given their characteristics such as good biocompatibility and tunable properties. Herein we associate human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) with a commercial SAPH, PuramatrixTM, to evaluate how this three-dimensional microenvironment affects cell behavior and its ability to undergo chondrogenic differentiation. We demonstrate that the PuramatrixTM hydrogel comprises a highly porous matrix permissible for hASC adhesion and in vitro expansion. The morphology and cell growth dynamics of hASCs were affected when cultured on the hydrogel but had minimal alteration in their immunophenotype. Interestingly, hASCs spontaneously formed cell aggregates throughout culturing. Analysis of glycosaminoglycan production and gene expression revealed a noteworthy and donor-dependent trend suggesting that PuramatrixTM hydrogel may have a natural capacity to support the chondrogenic differentiation of hASCs. Altogether, the results provide a more comprehensive understanding of the potential applications and limitations of the PuramatrixTM hydrogel in developing functional cartilage tis-",

            "text": "Articular cartilage lesions are a consequence of the degradation of cartilaginous tissue in response to various metabolic, genetic, vascular, or traumatic stimuli. Cartilage damage can arise from a single instance of excessive load on the joint or the accumulation of repeated minor episodes [1]. These types of lesions are relatively common, as evidenced by a comprehensive review of 31,516 cases of knee arthropathy involving patients over 20 years old conducted by Curl et al. [2]. Their study revealed that 63% of the knees examined exhibited chondral lesions, while 20% presented osteochondral lesions. Notably, 5% of these cases occurred in patients under the age of 40. Unfortunately, a significant proportion of chondral lesions are inherently irreversible, even with the current therapeutic options available. This limitation arises from the intrinsic characteristics of cartilage, including its lack of vascularization, innervation, lymphatic drainage, and readily available progenitor cells for repair [3]. Among the cartilage regeneration strategies, autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) is currently considered the gold standard for treating such lesions. In ACI, chondrocytes are isolated from healthy cartilage regions in the patient, cultured in the laboratory, and subsequently re-implanted into the damaged area, aiming to repopulate the tissue, increasing the production of cartilaginous extracellular matrix (ECM) and promoting tissue\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4630. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym15244630 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4630 2 of 17\nregeneration [4]. Although articular chondrocytes can be considered the logical choice of cells, they present certain limitations, such as instability and dedifferentiation during monolayer culture, as well as a requirement for a limited amount of healthy donor tissue [5]. Consequently, alternative cell sources, such as mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs), have gained significant attention. MSCs can not only differentiate into chondrocytes, promoting the formation of new cartilage, but they also exhibit paracrine effects on resident cells [6]. By releasing bioactive factors, extracellular vesicles, and components of the ECM, they actively modulate the behavior of receptor cells, including chondrocytes, endogenous stem cells, and macrophages, influencing crucial cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, migration, macrophage polarization, metabolism, and apoptosis [7]. Therefore, MSCs can effectively regulate the local microenvironment, contributing to the repair and regeneration of damaged cartilage. Considering these promising characteristics, MSCs have already been tested in clinical trials for the treatment of articular lesions, with observed outcomes in terms of improved physical functioning surpassing ACI [8]. However, intra-articular injection of stem cells for cartilage injury treatment presents significant limitations, including the high rate of cell death at the injection site [9] and the extravasation of these cells into locations beyond the joint space, given their tendency to migrate to other organs or tissues [10]. To address these limitations, tissue engineering techniques utilizing three-dimensional scaffolds, particularly hydrogels, have been employed to enhance the delivery and survival of stem cells. Hydrogels have gained prominence in cartilage tissue engineering due to their resemblance to the native cartilaginous matrix, characterized by a porous structure that enables cellular transport and proliferation [3]. Moreover, hydrogels can be minimally invasively injected into damaged tissue [11]. Self-assembling peptide hydrogels have garnered attention in the field of cartilage regeneration, primarily due to their biocompatibility and tunable properties, mimicking the mechanical characteristics of natural cartilage [12]. One notable peptide hydrogel, RADA-16 (RADARADARADARADA), commercially known as Puramatrix\u2122, holds great promise in the research and treatment of articular lesions. It forms a stable three-dimensional structure with certain permeability, closely resembling the native 3D ECM, facilitating cell adhesion and migration [13]. Hence, it serves as an ideal model for cartilage injury investigations. Liu and colleagues [14] demonstrated that chondrocytes seeded in Puramatrix\u2122 maintained their cartilage phenotype and produced cartilaginous ECM, with type II collagen expression sustained for at least three weeks after seeding [14]. Another study observed that bovine MSCs encapsulated within Puramatrix\u2122 hydrogel led to increased glycosaminoglycan (GAG) production and type II collagen deposition [15]. Additionally, the association between Puramatrix\u2122 coating and quail embryonic neural crest-derived cells resulted in the formation of GAG-rich cartilaginous nodules and significant chondroitin sulfate detection [16]. Despite these and other advances in the development of biomimetic cartilage tissues, there are several challenges regarding the regenerative potential and effectiveness of different approaches. These include (1) the selection of appropriate biomaterials, (2) the utilization of 3D structures, (3) the availability of molecular cues, and (4) the identification of optimal cell types and combinations of cells and growth factors. Addressing these peculiarities is crucial for optimizing cartilage regeneration strategies. Thus, this study investigated the association between human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) and the Puramatrix\u2122 hydrogel, evaluating how this 3D microenvironment affects their behavior and ability to undergo chondrogenic differentiation. By doing so, we expect to contribute to the development of improved strategies for cartilage regeneration."

Further inspection of the hydrogel layer confirmed that PURA comprises a highly porous, compact nanofibrous array with pore diameters ranging from 10 to 200 nm (Figure 3B,C). The hydrogel layer showed no signs of damage or degradation after 5 and 10 days. Then, we evaluated whether PURA could affect hASC adhesion. After 20 min of incubation, both TCPs and PURA had the same number of cells adhered; however, as time progressed, both at 40 min and 2 h of incubation, PURA had about half the number of cells adhered in comparison to TCP (Figure 3D,E), showing that cells adhered slower to PURA compared to TCPs. After adhesion, we assessed hASC growth dynamics on PURA. After 1 day of cell culture, DNA quantification indicated a similar number of cells in TCP and PURA cultures at this time point (Figure 4A). After 5 days, a marked increase in the amount of DNA was observed in the TCP culture compared to PURA; however, the effect size was small (TCP: 18.77 \u00b5g/mL \u00b1 6.81; PURA: 6.1 \u00b5g/mL \u00b1 5.21).

Initially, we characterized the microtopography of the Puramatrix\u2122 and conducted comprehensive biocompatibility assays to evaluate the response of hASCs to this culturing condition. Several factors can affect cellular behavior when cells are cultured in hydrogels, including compos tion, stiffn ss, pore size, degrad tion, and viscoelasticity [20]. The coating used in this study had nanopores betw en 10 and 200 nm. Previous studies have already demon trated that alumina membranes with pore di meters of 20 m allow more adhesion of macrophages but less cytokine rele se compared to alumina membranes with pore diam ters of 200 nm [21]. A omparison of TiO2 nanotubes of 20, 50, or 100 nm pore diameters showed that ther was higher hMSC steogenesis inductio in nanotubes with 20 nm pore dia eters, while the human osteoblast lineage preferred the 50 nm nanotubular structures for oste blastic maturation [22]. In additio , MSCs encapsulated in a hydrogel with ~5 n pore size affect the secretome composition compared to plating cells in a scaffold with a ~120 \u00b5m pore size [23]. It is worth noting that pore size changes the cell behavior in different aspects, but the co position of the hydrogel, the culture\nethodology (seeding or encapsulation) as well as other factors also contribute to the observed effect. Furthermore, smaller pores allow for a controlled release of growth factors such as TGF\u03b2 [24]. Considering the potential of Puramatrix\u2122 coating, future perspectives\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4630 13 of 17\ninclude encapsulating the hASCs in Puramatrix\u2122 and functionalizing this hydrogel with growth factors (such as TGF \u03b2) that can allow its steady release, offering a lasting stimulus to the cells. Moreover, previous atomic force microscopic analysis by Ortineau and colleagues [25] demonstrated that different concentrations of Puramatrix\u2122 hydrogel exhibit distinct topographic features. At concentrations of 0.15% and 0.25%, the hydrogel formed a network of thin and scattered fibers. However, the fibrous network became denser at a concentration of 0.5%, indicating a more compact structure [25]. Additionally, increasing the concentration of Puramatrix\u2122 hydrogel not only reduced the size of the hydrogel pores but also increased its stiffness [26], potentially influencing cell adhesion, proliferation, and migration [27]. Our SEM analysis confirmed that 0.5% Puramatrix\u2122 resulted in a compact nanofibrous network. Despite its compact structure, Sharma and coworkers [28] demonstrated that Puramatrix\u2122, at a concentration of 0.5%, allowed MSCs to effectively migrate into the matrix, avoiding the stress caused by the encapsulation process [28]. In another study conducted by Shivachar [29], this concentration of Puramatrix\u2122 provided a structure with pore sizes large enough for neurons to extend their dendrites and form synapses with neighboring cells. However, although the pore size increased at lower concentrations (<0.25%), the hydrogel was too soft and fragile to handle [29]. This issue was avoided in our study, as the SEM analysis revealed that Puramatrix\u2122 at 0.5% concentration remained resistant to culture media exchanges for a period of up to 10 days, meaning it could offer cells a lasting stimulus throughout the cell culture process. This hydrogel structure allowed the adhesion of hASCs but at a slower pace compared to the tissue culture plate. While 2 h was enough for all the plated cells to adhere to the TCP, cells in PURA needed more time to fully interact with the hydrogel layer. This was confirmed during the growth dynamics assay since the number of cells in TCPs and PURA were similar following the first 24 h of cell culturing. The growth dynamics assay also revealed that the Puramatrix\u2122 hydrogel may modulate cell proliferation and maintenance. While hASCs in PURA grew slowly and steadily throughout the experiment, cells in TCPs showed rapid growth during the first 5 days and steady growth after that. One possibility is that hASCs in TCPs may be simply reaching a higher confluence earlier, as seen in Figure 5A, which can end up reducing the cell\u2019s proliferation rate after the cells reach the physical limits of the area of the plate well [30]. The observed difference in growth dynamics in our study may be attributed to changes in cell death or proliferation rates. However, our investigation demonstrated that this was not necessarily the case. We found that Puramatrix\u2122 hydrogel was not cytotoxic and did not increase the percentage of proliferating hASCs, which suggests that factors other than cell death or proliferation mechanisms may underlie the disparities in the observed growth patterns. Although it remains unclear what caused these differences, taking note from our microscopy analysis (adhesion assay and SEM), we hypothesize that cells on PURA require a longer time to settle in this new environment. While cells on TCPs are already actively dividing, cells on Puramatrix\u2122 hydrogel undergo an initial adaptation period before entering the proliferative stage. In physiologically relevant ECMs, such as Puramatrix\u2122, cells often exhibit distinct migration and proliferation patterns [31]. The need for matrix remodeling [32] and the mechanical cues triggered by the softer substrate [33] may be exactly what caused the differences in cell behavior and growth dynamics seen in our study. Overall, our findings are consistent with previous studies that have employed various cytotoxicity and cell interaction assays to demonstrate Puramatrix\u2122 biocompatibility, such as the diffusion assay in agar (ISO 10993-5) and the human plasma assay (ISO 10993-4) [27]. For instance, Cavalcanti et al. [34] conducted a study utilizing dental pulp stem cells encapsulated in Puramatrix\u2122 hydrogel, testing different cell densities and Puramatrix\u2122 concentrations (ranging from 0.05% to 0.25%). Their results demonstrated that cells were able to proliferate within 72 h, and no differences were observed among the various cell densities and concentrations [34]. Although our Puramatrix\u2122 concentration was\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4630 14 of 17\nhigher (0.5%), we confirmed that cells remained viable in the Puramatrix hydrogel even at higher concentrations. The impact of Puramatrix\u2122 on hASC morphology was remarkable. This could potentially be attributed to the soft nature of Puramatrix\u2122 hydrogel, as it is widely known that substrate stiffness plays a crucial role in regulating cell behaviors such as spreading [35]. A study by Sun and colleagues [36] delved into the influence of ECM stiffness on cell morphology by investigating MCF-7 cells cultured on collagen-coated polyacrylamide (PAAm) gels with varying elastic moduli. The results revealed that cells that adhered to the softer surface had a rounded morphology and smaller spreading area. In contrast, cells that adhered to the stiffer surface displayed a spindle shape and a larger spreading area [36]. Interestingly, in the current study, when the hASCs were cultured on Puramatrix hydrogel, a soft substrate, they did not exhibit a uniform round shape. Instead, they displayed a variety of morphologies and cell aggregation, as observed through fluorescence microscopy and SEM analysis, ultimately resulting in a smaller cell spreading area. In relation to cell aggregation, Ortinau and colleagues [25] previously reported the formation of aggregates in human neural progenitor cells in Puramatrix\u2122 in concentrations of 0.25 and 0.5%, with more compact spheroids being formed at the higher concentration. In our study, it was observed that the formation of cell aggregates on PURA occurred spontaneously over the course of the 20-day culture period, as the aggregates gradually increased in both quantity and size. SEM analysis revealed that the aggregates were formed both by cells interacting with the substrate and cells interacting with each other, showing that Puramatrix\u2122 hydrogel did not only influence the morphology of the hASCs but also induced the aggregation of these cells, leading to the formation of high-density cellular structures. These findings hold significant promise for cartilage tissue engineering, as cell aggregation is a critical step in the chondrogenic differentiation process [37]. Although the morphology of the hASCs was affected by Puramatrix\u2122, the immunophenotypic profile of the cells was not significantly impacted under the given culture conditions, at least for the markers evaluated in this study. Building upon these previous observations, we investigated the potential of the Puramatrix\u2122 hydrogel to promote chondrogenesis. The assessment of chondrogenic differentiation through Safranin O staining and quantification of GAG production revealed a noteworthy trend suggesting that Puramatrix\u2122 hydrogel may have an inherent capability to induce GAG production. Moreover, it had an augmentative effect on the potential of hASCs to produce this ECM component spontaneously and upon induction of chondrogenic differentiation. These findings imply a potential synergistic interaction between the Puramatrix\u2122 and the chemical inducers present in the chondrogenic differentiation medium. The findings obtained in our study align with previous research conducted by Kopesky et al. [15], supporting the notion that Puramatrix\u2122 hydrogel possesses the remarkable capacity to induce glycosaminoglycan (GAG) production during chondrogenic differentiation. In their study, it was demonstrated that bovine MSCs in Puramatrix\u2122 hydrogel had twice the level of GAG production compared to those in an agarose hydrogel. Additionally, Taufer et al. [16] conducted a study on trunk neural crest cells from quail embryos undergoing chondrogenic differentiation in 0.15%, 0.25%, and 0.5% Puramatrix\u2122. Their findings, though a different experimental model, corroborate our observations, as they detected aggregates containing cartilage extracellular matrix [16]. Collectively, these findings highlight the remarkable potential of Puramatrix\u2122 hydrogel in inducing GAG production during chondrogenic differentiation. Furthermore, our gene expression analysis provides further evidence supporting the potential for PURA to promote chondrogenic differentiation. The expression of chondrogenic genes such as SOX9, COL2, and ACAN was upregulated in cells cultured with Puramatrix\u2122 hydrogel. These findings align with the observations made by Betriu and E. Semino [38], who reported a twofold increase in SOX9 expression in MSCs cultured in 0.3% Puramatrix\u2122 compared to tissue culture plates. While these results are promising, it is important to consider that an increase in the expression of hypertrophic genes such as\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4630 15 of 17\nCOL10 and MMP13 was also observed in our study [36]. This may suggest the potential of the Puramatrix\u2122 hydrogel to induce chondrocyte hypertrophy. Further investigations are needed to explore whether this differentiation influence exerted by PURA occurs under different conditions, such as in vivo environments. On the other hand, it is worth noting that signs of hypertrophic chondrogenic differentiation are commonly observed in cartilage tissue engineering research. For instance, a recent study showed that MSCs cultured in hydrogels composed of gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) and different concentrations of methacrylated chondroitin sulfate (CSMA) increased COL10 expression across all concentrations [39]. These findings highlight the challenge of hypertrophic differentiation and emphasize the need to investigate strategies aimed at minimizing or inhibiting this process. A limitation encountered throughout our study relates to the variability observed across biological replicates. This variability can be attributed to inherent differences among hASC donors, leading to variations in the chondrogenic differentiation potential of each biological replicate. This was also described for other MSCs, such as bone-marrow MSCs, during chondrogenic differentiation [40]. While increasing the number of donors could potentially mitigate this limitation, it is important to acknowledge that the need to consider variations in donor chondrogenic potential has already been highlighted in a study by Kim et al. [41]. In their research, they observed significant differences in the functional chondrogenesis of hMSCs within hyaluronic acid hydrogels across eight different donors. Hence, for clinical applications, it may be necessary to tailor treatment settings to a perdonor basis to achieve more robust cartilage tissue formation [36]. Furthermore, it is important to acknowledge that the results presented in our study could be masked if the assays are solely performed using a single-cell lineage. This underscores the significance of employing a comprehensive methodology that encompasses multiple cell donors in tissue engineering investigations. By doing so, we can obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the potential applications and limitations of the proposed approaches in developing functional cartilage tissue constructs."

            "text": "In this study, we were able to better understand how the SAPH Puramatrix\u2122 influences hASCs. We noticed that PURA stimulated a considerable increase in the expression of chondrogenic genes and the production of GAGs that were more evident in some individual hASC biological replicates. In addition, an interesting and unexpected fact observed was the spontaneous formation of cellular aggregates in the Puramatrix\u2122, one of the initial stages of chondrogenesis. Considering the induced shift in cell behavior and the observation of initial chondrogenesis induction, we postulated that Puramatrix\u2122 can be used as a biomaterial for application in cartilage regeneration, although more studies are needed to confirm this. Optimizing a chondrogenic differentiation strategy in a donor-specific manner, assaying new concentrations of hydrogel and other growth factors, evaluating the secretome of MSCs cultured on PURA, and performing in vivo assays are interesting perspectives that can be pursued to expand our knowledge on Puramatrix\u2122 and hASCs for cartilage tissue engineering.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, R.N., A.W.R. and M.A.S.; methodology and investigation, R.N. and R.J.; funding acquisition, M.A.S.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, R.N.; writing\u2014review and editing and supervision, A.W.R. and M.A.S.
