    "abstractText": "We report on glass-molded micro-optical interposers for single-mode fiber-to-PIC coupling fabricated in parallel by isothermal molding of 1-inch glass plates yielding over 100 arrays of 8 lenses each. Excess losses between PIC and singlemode fiber are below 1 dB. In addition to allowing a narrow package footprint, beam transformation maps mode profiles between fibers and surface couplers, and, in case of grating couplers, can adapt the light incidence angle on a wavelengthspecific basis, facilitating packaging of PICs in CWDM and LAN-WDM modules. The interposers can be further extended to support polarization management and isolation by coating with polarization selective thin film stacks in MacNeille configuration, as well as wavelength multiplexing by coating with dichroic stacks. Using this technique, over 256 bidirectional transceiver channels can be packaged in the footprint of a single reticle.",

Besides providing compact light routing and fiber coupling capabilities, they have been engineered to support wavelength division multiplexing (WDM), polarization management, and optical isolation. By leveraging the degrees of freedom afforded by mold based shaping, functional elements such as reflective surfaces, mechanical attachment surfaces, spacers and alignment fiducials can be integrated in the same glass piece without increasing processing time. This differentiates this fabrication process from other methods used to manufacture dense lens arrays such as grey-scale lithography6 and significantly reduces the number of piece parts required to manufacture complex interposers."

The cycling time of the glass press is limited by the requirement of heating up and cooling down the entire process chamber, in our case ~20 minutes.

It does, however, present additional restrictions in terms of the features that can be molded due to the thermal gradients in the glass and requires more expensive equipment. Since we are currently molding up to a 1000 lenses in parallel into a 1\u201d by 1\u201d glass wafer and have the ability to further parallelize the process, the developed isothermal molding process is compatible with very high volumes. Currently fabricated microlenses are grouped in arrays of four overlapping lenses having each a radius of curvature (ROC) of 220 \u00b5m and spaced by 250 \u00b5m from each other. White light interferometry reveals a manufacturing precision with a global deviation from target below 20 nm and a local root mean square roughness in the single-digit nanometer range. These groups of lenses are arranged on the glass wafer to allow simple dicing and handling thereafter. Their density is also constrained by the overall interposer functionality described in the following and is thus not an intrinsic limitation of the glass molding process itself."

            "text": "Figure 1 shows the simplest glass interposer configuration. As represented in the schematic in Fig. 1(a), two identical glass pieces, with four lenses each spaced 250 \u00b5m apart, are joined together with ultraviolet (UV)-curable index-matched epoxy. These interposer building blocks are obtained by dicing of the glass wafer in which they have been molded in parallel. Attachment surfaces allow the mounting of the interposer on top of a PIC or an optical sub-mount, as well as attachment of a fiber array (FA). The group of lenses are recessed by 400 \u00b5m so that the emitting/receiving surface of the PIC or FA are close to the focal plane of the lenses. Consequently, the light, with beam path represented by the red arrows inside of the interposer, is collimated inside it. A flat surface tilted 45o relative to the reference planes of the lenses acts as a mirror that redirects the light across a 90o angle by total internal reflection. Routing of the light on a Cartesian grid relaxes the tolerance on the building block thickness, given by the distance between the top and bottom mold during the forming process, as it then no longer influences the position at which the beam exits the structure relative to the output lens array. Moreover, the beams are expanded to a mode field diameter in the order of a hundred micrometer at the junction between the glass pieces, placing the assembly tolerances well within the reach of high-throughput pick-and-place assembly.\nThe outer dimensions of the interposer are labeled in Fig. 1(b). With surface 1 attached to the PIC, the height of the subassembly can be kept below 2.66 mm, compatible with low-rise form factors. The 2 mm structure width (along the direction in which the lenses are placed next to each other) was chosen to be compatible with standard FAs. Together with requirements for reliable epoxy based attachment, this constrains the footprint of the current configuration. To connect more than 4 fibers to a single PIC with parallel optical interfaces, interposer blocks as depicted in Fig. 1 can be left attached to each other in a bar containing several groups of four lenses and transferred together to the optical subassembly."

The facets of the FAs have a polished surface nominally angled by 2.4o, close to the emission angle of 1310 nm grating couplers (GCs) we have developed. The measurement setup is shown in Fig. 5(a). The facets of the FAs are flush with the attachment surfaces of the interposer, with which they are in mechanical contact. In Fig. 5(b), we can see that the ILs of the interposer with FAs are slightly worse than those with freely aligned fibers. This is due to the facets of the fibers embedded in the FAs being constrained to lie exactly in the interposer\u2019s attachment planes, showing that the fabricated lenses are not yet ideal for this configuration and should be retargeted to recover this small drop in ILs (it is visible in Fig. 4 that one of the freely moveable fibers has its facet slightly inside the recessed region of the interposers, revealing that the focal lengths of the lenses are slightly too short to be optimum). The positioning of the lenses relative to each other on a given block is better than \u00b11 \u00b5m and leads to negligible ILs on its own, but could also stack up with fiber positioning tolerances in the FAs. The pronounced ripple in the spectra has a free spectral range that could be attributed to the optical path length between the two FA facets. ILs between coupled fibers remain better than 2 dB over the entire O- and C-bands, see Figs. 5(b) and 5(c). Cross-talk between adjacent channels on either the opposite sides or the same side of the interposer is extremely low and remains below -80 dB.\nFigure 6 shows the alignment tolerance at channel 1 at a wavelength of 1310 nm (corresponding axes are indicated in Fig. 5(a)).

Reference data is collected by directly positioning the FA onto the PIC, see Fig. 7(a). The FA used here is also populated with standard single-mode fibers with a pitch of 250 \u00b5m, its facet is however polished with a 6o angle. The PIC was fabricated in a 220 nm thick silicon-on-insulator (SOI) device layer in the standard SiP process at Singapore\u2019s Advanced Micro Foundry (AMF). Two pairs of GCs are used on the PIC to form two waveguide loops, providing a total of four optical ports to couple to, with a pitch matched to that of the interposer and of the FA.\nTransmission spectra recorded between two FA ports coupling to a waveguide loop via GCs without (blue curve) and with (red curve) interposer are shown in Fig. 7(c). In order to show the losses per interface, the total fiber-to-fiber insertion losses were divided by two. For the case without interposer, the minimum loss is 4.2 dB at a wavelength of 1602.6 nm, while for the case with interposer the minimum loss is 5.1 dB at a wavelength of 1597.2 nm, corresponding to an excess loss of less than a dB. The 3-dB bandwidth of 60.4 nm without interposer is reduced to 39.5 nm, due to the smaller than ideal lens focal distance, as explained in the following.\nFigure 8(a) shows the image of the packaged PIC with interposer and FA. After the FA and interposer were aligned to the GC pair on the PIC, UV-curable epoxy was dispensed onto the interposer attachment surfaces, that were then brought in contact with the PIC and the FA, after which the FA and interposer were realigned and the epoxy cured by UV light. Figure 8(b) shows the transmission spectra corresponding to FA coupling without (blue curve) and with bonded interposer (red curve), again divided by two to represent the ILs per optical port. After permanent attachment, the minimum loss was found to be 5.1 dB at a wavelength of 1604.3 nm with a 3-dB bandwidth of 38.8 nm. Comparing to direct FA coupling, the packaged PIC with interposer also has less than 1 dB excess ILs per optical port. The reduction of ILs compared to fiber-to-fiber experiments is attributed to the small beam transformation occurring inside the interposer, that may help here to better match the GC emission to the fiber mode."

            "text": "As reported in the previous section, for the first interposer designs a bandwidth reduction was observed compared to a GC directly coupled to an FA. However, this is rather unexpected as the interposer itself operates in a very wide wavelength range, covering multiple optical telecommunication bands. Moreover, the glass interposer is intended to act as a one-toone imaging device, imaging the GC emission at the surface of the PIC to the fiber interface and vice versa.\nTwo aspects come into play here. One is the slightly too low focal length of the interposer lenses used here, which leads to the PIC and FA being placed slightly behind the focal plane of the interposer, since the distances to the lenses are fixed to 400 \u00b5m by the lens recess. The other one is the well-known wavelength dependence of GC emission angles, predicted from diffraction.\nThus, a change in the wavelength leads to a change in the angle of the emitted light. Since the angle at which the receiving fiber is polished is kept constant, this leads to a mismatch to the fiber mode in k-space and thus to an increase in ILs, both when an interposer is used or not. This corresponds to the behavior seen when attaching a FA directly onto the PIC, shown by the blue dotted curve in Fig. 9. With an interposer that ideally images the GC output one-to-one onto the fiber edge, the same wavelength dependency would be expected. However, since the focal length of the lenses was chosen a bit too short, the GC emission is imaged at a point slightly before the fiber facet. Besides generating some excess insertion losses, this\nProc. of SPIE Vol. 12007 120070M-6 Downloaded From: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie on 18 Jan 2024 Terms of Use: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/terms-of-use\nalso leads to a pivot effect in regards to where the light reaches the FA. Indeed, the image remains at the same point as the GC emission angle changes, however further propagation past this point leads to a wavelength dependent beam displacement at the FA. Compensating this on a wavelength specific basis is rather straightforward prior to permanent attachment, as the FA only needs to be translated in the plane of the attachment plane. This is shown in Fig. 9 for four different cases, where the alignment was repeated at different wavelengths for which an insertion loss similar and in some cases even better than the reference case was obtained at the alignment wavelength. Consequently, it is expected that the bandwidth reduction will disappear once the reoptimized lenses have been fabricated for the conjugated image planes to coincide with the attachment surfaces."

            "text": "Due to both the increased cost of polarization maintaining fiber (PMF) itself, as well as the increased complexity of aligning its slow/fast axis to the polarization of the light during assembly, SMF fiber is usually preferred, even in very short distance optical connections. This does lead, however, to challenges related to polarization management, in particular when polarization sensitive interfaces such as GCs are being utilized.8 Polarization splitting grating couplers9 (PSGC), while allowing for coupling of both fiber polarizations, are also subjected to polarization dependent losses (PDL) resulting from the non-orthogonality of the two fiber polarizations preferentially coupled to one of its two output waveguides after projection onto the PIC surface. While substantial progress has been made in reducing their PDL, this typically requires high resolution lithography with anisotropic scatterers10 not readily available in all foundry services. Other vertically emitting couplers do not split polarizations11 and require additional on-chip devices to handle them.12 Consequently, there are advantages to incorporate polarization management into the packaging solution if this does not significantly increase the package cost and complexity, as this may enable improvements of the overall link budget, of the PDL and of requirements placed on the lithography. Here, we propose an approach building on the interposer technology described above with very little added complexity by adding a polarization-beam-splitting (PBS) thin-film coating arranged in MacNeille configuration inside the interposer. Local deposition by shadow masking would remain compatible with batchprocessing at the glass wafer level and thus not add substantial cost.\nProc. of SPIE Vol. 12007 120070M-7 Downloaded From: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie on 18 Jan 2024 Terms of Use: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/terms-of-use\nFigure 10 shows a CAD drawing of an interposer configuration that can be used to receive light from an SMF with the regular polarization-sensitive GCs widely adopted in SiP. The beam path corresponding to coupling in light from the side is represented in blue. The topmost interposer building block does not require a lens in this side-coupled configuration and can be replaced by a simpler filler that only features the two 45o-angled surfaces. In any case, it can be placed without requiring precise alignment in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the beam propagation, as it only serves to provide a homogeneous dielectric environment on both sides of the PBS and a medium in which the beam can propagate.\nBlue arrows are overlaid on the beam path to represent the polarization of the electric field. When the light enters the assembly from an SMF embedded in the FA shown to the right, it gets collimated by the interposer lens and travels through the glass body. At the 45o-angled surface-coated internal facet, it is split into two beams with orthogonal polarizations. Separate lenses refocus the light onto the GCs placed on the PIC below, that are rotated such that the light reaches them with the appropriate polarization.\nSimilarly, top coupling can be realized by attaching the FA to the topmost building block, as shown in Fig. 11. In this case, the rightmost interposer is no longer required. While in this case the polarization arriving at the PIC is rotated by 90o for each of the optical interfaces, this can be easily adapted for by reorienting them.\nThese interposer configurations can be used to handle polarization at a receiver or two launch separate data streams at a polarization diverse transmitter. Similar challenges exist in coarse wavelength division multiplexed (CWDM) transceivers, since GCs have finite optical bandwidths and external (de-)multiplexer might thus be preferrable. Such external packagebased MUX-functionality is moreover unavoidable in transceiver solutions based on vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) and large area detectors (LADs)13 and can be obtained by replacing the PBS coating by dichroic mirrors in the extrusion drawing shown in Fig. 10. Evidently, the interposer configuration would then benefit from an increased element count on the bottom plane, combining a larger number of dichroic mirrors in the beam path. This can be simply realized by dicing the glass wafer into larger blocks along the horizontal propagation axis. Four basic blocks can for example be transferred together to the PIC to handle four groups of wavelengths each fitting within the typical 25 nm wide 1-dB bandwidth of single polarization GCs.8,14 The glass interposers can be further adapted to route the light with a different angle to or from individual grating couplers, depending on their center wavelength. This allows to further improve their coupling efficiency since fully optimized GCs either require a custom buried oxide (BOX) thickness or a custom emission angle.\nBack reflections are generally undesirable in optical communication systems and particularly problematic when they return to the emitting laser, due to resulting instabilities and laser emission coherence loss. While in some SiP transceiver solutions the laser is mounted in a micro-package already provided with optical isolation,15,16 heterogeneous integration of lasers inside an SiP chip17,18 in particular calls for an isolator at the output of the transmitter. Optical isolators typically make use of non-reciprocal Faraday rotators together with polarization selective elements such as birefringent materials. We combine the functionality of the polarization splitting interposer shown in Fig. 10 with latching garnets with a high Verdet constant attached as small dies onto the PIC on top of the GC. Due to their small size, with a few 100 \u00b5m to a side, they fit below the recess molded into the glass, see the extrusion diagram in Fig. 11. They can be cut to the adequate dimensions by using either laser cutting with high-power pulsed lasers19 or with a conventional dicing saw, with the latter\nProc. of SPIE Vol. 12007 120070M-8 Downloaded From: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie on 18 Jan 2024 Terms of Use: https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/terms-of-use\nrequiring a remagnetization step after dicing, due to the high-level of induced vibrations. The small size of the garnet dies is essential to keep material costs low.\nThese garnets are commercially available with broadband antireflective (AR) coatings adapted to a garnet-air interface on the one side and a garnet-SiO2 interface on the other, so that minimal additional ILs are obtained when they are attached to the PIC with a suitable index matched epoxy. Their thickness is adjusted so that together with the saturation remanence and the Verdet constant of the garnet a single light pass at the design wavelength leads to a 45o rotation of the polarization. To keep the compatibility with the PBS coating introduced above, the GCs are rotated by an additional 45o (Fig. 11). The depth of the recess in which the lenses are molded is adjusted to account for the beam path through the increased refractive index of the garnet, after which ray tracing simulations indicate an increase in ILs of less than 0.1 dB.\nThe optical isolation functionality is obtained from a combination of the PBS, the Faraday rotator and the polarization selectivity of the GCs. Reflected light returns to the GCs with the orthogonal polarization with which it was emitted. The light is then attenuated by an additional ~20 dB typical for the polarization sensitivity of standard single polarization GCs.8"

The p-polarization is almost entirely reflected with a residual transmission below -23 dB across the O-band.\nTo be able to better estimate the performance of the layer stack after fabrication imperfections are taken into account, Monte Carlo simulations are performed with the commercial software Lumerical STACK after comparing the nominal design results to our own transfer matrix calculations. The results of this analysis are shown in the right panel of Fig. 12. Conservative assumptions were considered for all parameters, for example the control over the angle of incidence that we can achieve in practice is below 0.1o.\nIn a similar fashion, dichroic coatings for wavelength splitting and combining can be realized, which would allow optimization of GCs and other usually wavelength-dependent integrated components towards higher performance/lower optical bandwidths. Since dichroic mirrors are fabricated on interposer facets defined by the glass molding process with tolerances below 0.1o, a very good reproducibility of their cutoff wavelength can be obtained."
