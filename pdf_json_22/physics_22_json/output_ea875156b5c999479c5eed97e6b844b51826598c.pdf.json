    "abstractText": "This work aims to investigate the behaviour of compact stars in the background of f(R, T ) theory of gravity. For current work, we consider the Krori-Barua metric potential i.e., \u03bd(r) = Br +C and \u03bb(r) = Ar, where, A,B and C are constants. We use matching conditions of spherically symmetric space-time with Schwarzschild solution as an exterior geometry and examine the physical behaviour of stellar structure by assuming the exponential type f(R, T ) gravity model. In the present analysis, we discuss the graphical behaviour of energy density, radial pressure, tangential pressure, equation of state parameters, anisotropy and stability analysis respectively. Furthermore, an equilibrium condition can be visualized through the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov equation. Some extra features of compact stars i.e. mass-radius function, compactness factor and surface redshift have also been investigated. Conclusively, all the results in current study validate the existence of compact stars under exponential f(R, T ) gravity model.",

We use matching conditions of spherically symmetric space-time with Schwarzschild solution as an exterior geometry and examine the physical behaviour of stellar structure by assuming the exponential type f(R, T ) gravity model. In the present analysis, we discuss the graphical behaviour of energy density, radial pressure, tangential pressure, equation of state parameters, anisotropy and stability analysis respectively. Furthermore, an equilibrium condition can be visualized through the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov equation. Some extra features of compact stars i.e. mass-radius function, compactness factor and surface redshift have also been investigated.

INTRODUCTION\nThe spatial behaviour of accelerated expansion of the universe is the most attractive topic of discussion among astrophysicists, and this expansion of the universe relies on dark matter (DM), ordinary matter (OM), and dark energy (DE) [1\u20134]. Therefore, General relativity (GR) provides the most satisfactory results and develops a basic understanding of gravitational theories. But GR alone does not give more appropriate outcomes to determine the mysterious nature of DE. Due to the limitation of GR, the modified theories have become more popular among cosmologists. Different modified theories are available in the literature such as, f(R), f(G), f(T ), f(Q), f(R, T ), f(R,G), f(R, \u03c6) and f(R, \u03c6,X) theories of gravity [5]-[22]. Interestingly in recent times, astrophysicists intend to investigate the stability and collapsing aspect of stellar structures with the help of modified theories of gravity. Cognola et al. [23] presented the exponential type gravity models to study the physical behaviour of stellar structures. Naz et al. [24] investigated the existence of a new classification of embedded class-I solutions of compact stars, by using the Karmarkar condition in f(R) gravity background. Later, Shamir et al. [25] discussed the physical analysis of charged anisotropic Bardeen spheres in the f(R) theory of gravity with the Krori-Barua metric. Harko [7] proposed the f(R, T ) theory of gravity, which is a combination of the Ricci scalar and trace of the energy-momentum tensor. Moreas et al. [26] studied the hydrostatic equilibrium configuration of neutron stars and strange stars in the background of the f(R, T ) theory of gravity. Das et al. [27] generated a set of solutions describing the interior of a compact star under the f(R, T ) theory of gravity, which admits conformal motion. Later, Waheed et al. [28] explored the existence of a new family of compact star solutions by adopting the Karmarkar as well as Pandey-Sharma condition in the background of f(R, T ) modified gravitational framework. Ilyas [29] explored and analyzed a set of solutions describing the interior structure of relativistic compact stellar structures with the variable cosmological constant in the f(R, T ) theory of gravity. Zubair et al. [30] constructed an anisotropic solution for spherically symmetric space-time that satisfies Karmarkar condition in the context of the f(R, T ) theory of gravity. Furthermore, Pretel et al. [31] investigated the equilibrium and radial stability of spherically symmetric relativistic stars, considering a polytropic equation of state, within the framework of f(R, T ) gravity with a conservative energy-momentum tensor. Islam et al. [32] presented the interior solutions of distributions of magnetized fluid inside a sphere in f(R, T ) gravity, in which the magnetized sphere is embedded in an exterior Reissner\u2013Nordstro\u0308m metric.\n\u2217Electronic address: farasat.shamir@nu.edu.pk \u2020Electronic address: zoyaasghar16411@gmail.com \u2021Electronic address: adnan.malik@skt.umt.edu.pk; Electronic address: adnanmalik\u02d9chheena@yahoo.com\n2 Shamir and Waseem [33] analyzed the nature of anisotropic spherically symmetric relativistic star models in the framework of f(R, T ) theory of gravity by considering the MIT bag model equation of state. Lobato et al. [34] investigated the neutron stars in f(R, T ) gravity using realistic equations of state in the light of massive pulsars and GW170817.\nInvestigating the behaviour of stellar structures by using the Krori-Barua metric has been a very fascinating topic among researchers. Bhar [35] provided a new model of a hybrid star with strange quark matter along with normal baryonic matter in the framework of Krori and Barua ansatz. Rahaman et al. [36] explored the possibility of applying the Krori and Barua model to describe ultra-compact objects like strange stars and the consequences of a mathematical description to model strange stars have been analyzed. Biswas et al. [37] investigated the anisotropic charged strange stars in Krori-Barua spacetime under f(R, T ) theory of gravity. Sharif and Waseem [38] investigated the behaviour of anisotropic compact stars in the background of R + \u03b1R\u00b5\u03bdT\n\u00b5\u03bd gravity model and used Krori-Barua metric solutions, where constants are calculated using masses and radii of compact stars like Her X-1, SAX J 1808.4\u20133658, and 4U1820\u201330. Abbas et al. [39] studied the possibility of forming anisotropic compact stars in modified Gauss-Bonnet, namely called as f(G) theory of gravity which is one of the strong candidates, responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe and used an analytical solution of Krori and Barua metric to the Einstein field equations with an anisotropic form of matter and power law model of f(G) gravity. Shamir and Malik [40] discussed the behaviour of anisotropic compact stars using Krori-Barua metric in f(R, \u03c6) theory of gravity, where R and \u03c6 denote the Ricci scalar and scalar field respectively. Malik and his collaborators [41, 42] investigated the behaviour of charged compact stars in the modified f(R) theories of gravity and assumed the KroriBarua space-time to describe the geometry of the inner space, which is a singularity-free solution for a charged fluid sphere in general relativity. Bhar [43] considered the spherically symmetric spacetime along with anisotropic fluid distribution in the presence of an electric field in f(R, T ) theory of gravity admitting the Chaplygin equation of state. Hossein et al. [44] discussed the possibility of forming anisotropic compact stars from this cosmological constant as one of the competent candidates of dark energy by taking the analytical solution of the Krori and Barua metric. Later, Rehman et al. [45] explored the possibility of applying the Krori and Barua model to describe ultra-compact objects like strange stars and some bounds on the model parameters have been obtained for making it a viable model for strange stars.\nAfter being inspired by the preceding literature, we further extend the idea of Shamir et al. [25] in modified f(R, T ) gravity and investigate the physical behaviour of different compact stars by employing Krori-Barua spacetime. For our current study, we choose the exponential type f(R, T ) gravity model, i.e., f(R, T ) = R+\u03b1(e\u2212\u03b2R\u22121)+\u03bbT [23], which includes the Lagrangian matter Lm = \u2212 13 (pr+2pt) [7]. The arrangement of our manuscript is as follows: Section II is devoted to the mathematical formulation of f(R, T ) gravity in the framework of anisotropic distributions. Section III deals with the f(R, T ) gravity model and matching conditions for determining the unknown constants by comparing the intrinsic metric to Schwarzschild\u2019s exterior metric. Section IV is used to describe the physical analysis, such as anisotropic parameter, energy conditions, equation of state parameters, stability analysis, Tolman-OppenheimerVolkoff equation, mass-radius relationship, compactness factor, and surface redshift analysis. In the last section, we finalized the conclusive remarks.\nII. MODIFIED f(R, T ) FIELD EQUATIONS\nThe Einstein-Hilbert action in modified f(R, T ) gravity is given as\nS = \u222b \u221a\u2212g ( 1\n2\u03ba f(R, T ) + Lm\n)\nd4x, (1)\nwhere,\n\u2022 f is a function that depend on R and T ,\n\u2022 Lm is Lagrangian matter, \u2022 \u03ba = 8\u03c0G\nc4 denotes coupling constant,\n\u2022 g represents the determinant of metric g\u03b7\u03b6 .\nBy varying the action (1) with respect to metric tensor, we get modified f(R, T ) gravity field equation as\nfR(R, T )R\u03b7\u03b6 \u2212 1\n2 f(R, T )g\u03b7\u03b6 + (g\u03b7\u03b6\u2737\u2212\u2207\u03b7\u2207\u03b6)fR(R, T ) = 8\u03c0T\u03b7\u03b6 \u2212 fT (R, T )T\u03b7\u03b6 \u2212 fT (R, T )\u0398\u03b7\u03b6, (2)\n3 where, \u2737 \u2261 \u2207\u03b7\u2207\u03b6 denotes the D\u2019Alembertian symbol and \u2207\u03b7 symbolizes covariant derivative, whereas, fR(R, T ) = \u2202f(R,T )\n\u2202R and fT (R, T ) = \u2202f(R,T ) \u2202T . Furthermore, T\u03b7\u03b6 indicates the anisotropic energy momentum tensor is defined as\nT\u03b7\u03b6 = (\u03c1+ pt)u\u03b7u\u03b6 \u2212 ptg\u03b7\u03b6 + (pr \u2212 pt)X\u03b7X\u03b6 . (3)\nHere, X\u03b7 and X\u03b6 denote the four velocity vector with u\u03b7u\u03b7 = \u2212X \u03b7X\u03b7 = 1, whereas, \u03c1, pr and pt represent energy density and radial pressure and tangential pressure respectively. The covariant divergence becomes [46] presents\n\u2207\u03b7T\u03b7\u03b6 = fT (R, T ) 8\u03c0 \u2212 fT (R, T ) ( (T\u03b7\u03b6 +\u0398\u03b7\u03b6)\u2207\u03b7 ln fT (R, T ) +\u2207\u03b7\u0398\u03b7\u03b6 \u2212 1 2 g\u03b7\u03b6\u2207\u03b7T ) , (4)\nThe non-zero right hand side of Eq. (4) indicates that the f(R, T ) theory is covariantly divergent. The modified field equations (2) can be expressed as\nG\u03b7\u03b6 = 1\nfR(R, T )\n[ 8\u03c0T\u03b7\u03b6 + 1\n2 (f(R, T )\u2212RfR(R, T ))g\u03b7\u03b6 \u2212 fT (R, T )(T\u03b7\u03b6 +\u0398\u03b7\u03b6)\u2212 (g\u03b7\u03b6\u2737\u2212\u2207\u03b7\u2207\u03b6)fR(R, T )\n]\n. (5)\nHere, \u0398\u03b7\u03b6 is known as a scalar expansion and defined as \u0398\u03b7\u03b6 = \u22122T\u03b7\u03b6 \u2212 Pg\u03b7\u03b6 . We take Lm = \u2212P , where P = 1 3 (pr + 2pt) [7]. The spherically symmetric spacetime is defined as\nds2 = e\u03bddt2 \u2212 e\u03bbdr2 \u2212 r2(d\u03b82 + sin2\u03b8d\u03c62), (6)\nwhere, \u03bb and \u03bd are functions of r. Moreover, we consider the Krori and Barua metric potential i.e., \u03bd(r) = Br2+C and \u03bb(r) = Ar2, where, A,B and C are the constants. The anisotropic matter configuration must satisfy the conditions that e\u03bb|r=0 = 1 and e\u03bd |r=0 = eC , moreover, (e\u03bb) \u2032 = 2AeAr 2 r and (e\u03bd) \u2032 = 2BeC+Br 2\nr. As a result, the metric potential determined here assures that the potentials are well-behaved, nonsingular, and steady in the core of the compact star. The fundamental advantage of employing this approach is that it yields a singularity-free model. Fig. 1 exhibits that both metric potentials are minimum at the center and maximum at the surface boundary.\nIII. f(R, T ) GRAVITY MODEL AND MATCHING CONDITIONS\nHere, we choose an exponential model of the f(R, T ) gravity to examine the stability and consistency of the stellar system. This model helps us for obtaining a comprehensive understanding of the physical structure of the stellar star. The f(R, T ) gravity model [23] is defined as\nf(R, T ) = R+ \u03b1(e\u2212\u03b2R \u2212 1) + \u03b3T, (7)\nwhere, \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 are constant. This model is preferred because it exhibits exponential growth for the early phases of cosmic evolution. Cognola et al. [23] studied exponential-type models to determine the physical attributes of compact stars and claimed that the model satisfies every local test involving the consistency of spherical object problems and non-violation of Newtonian\u2019s law. Substituting all the values in Eq.

(10)\nwhere, Z1 = 124(\u03bb+4\u03c0) , Z2 = \u2212 2e\u2212Ar 2 ( Ar2(Br2+2)+eAr 2 \u2212B2r4\u22123Br2\u22121 ) r2 , Z3 = (1 \u2212 \u03b1\u03b2e\u2212\u03b2Z2),\nZ4 = \u2202Z3\u2202r , Z5 = \u2202Z2 4 \u2202r2 .\nThe Schwarzschild solution is considered the most appropriate choice for choosing among the numerous matching constraints while investigating compact objects in the background of GR. The Jebsen-Birkhoff theorem states that the solution of the Einstein field equations (EFE) must be asymptotically flat and static for spherically symmetric spacetime. When we encounter modified TOV equations with zero pressure and energy density, the exterior geometry solution may differ from the Schwarzschild solution in modified gravitational theories [47, 48]. However, in modified f(R, T ) gravity, the solution of Schwarzschild can be satisfied by preferring a realistic f(R, T ) gravity model for nonzero density and pressure. Due to this fact, the Birkhoff theorem violates the modified theories of gravity [49]. Many researchers have investigated matching conditions and provided remarkable results about the Schwarzchild solution [1, 50\u201352]. Now, to solve the EFE with the restricted condition at r = R, the pressure pr(r = R) = 0, we compare our interior solution to the outer Schwarzschild solution, which is defined by\nds2 = ( 1\u2212 2M r ) dt2 \u2212 ( 1\u2212 2M r )\u22121 dr2 \u2212 r2(d\u03b82 + sin2\u03b8d\u03c62), (11)\nwhere, M symbolizes the mass of stellar stars. The continuity of the metric functions of Eq. (5) at the r = R leads to the following form\ngrr + = grr \u2212, gtt + = gtt \u2212, \u2202gtt\n+\n\u2202r =\n\u2202gtt \u2212\n\u2202r . (12)\nHere, (+) denotes the exterior geometry and (\u2212) indicates the interior. Further, we use Eqs. (5), (11) and (12) to get the values of A, B, and C, given as\nA = 1\nR2 ln[\nR R\u2212 2M ], B = M R2(R \u2212 2M) , C = ln[ R\u2212 2M ReBR 2 ]. (13)\nTable I provides the constants A,B, and C regarding the mass and radius of the chosen compact objects. Moreover, it is necessary to mention that the following conditions must be fulfilled for the appropriate behavior of compact objects:\n\u2022 The plots of \u03c1, pr and pt have to be finite and maximum at the center.\n\u2022 The graphs of dpr dr , dpt dr and d\u03c1 dr should be negative.\n\u2022 The energy conditions must be satisfied.\n\u2022 It is necessary the radial and tangential equation of state must lie between zero and 1, i.e., 0 < wr, wt < 1.\n\u2022 The radial and transverse sound speed satisfy the range i.e., 0 < v2r , v 2 t < 1.\n\u2022 All forces should satisfy the equilibrium condition.\n5\nIn this section, we analyze the characteristics of stellar stars in f(R, T ) theory of gravity. We investigate the physical behavior of energy density, pressure components, equation of state parameters, surface redshift, energy conditions, stability analysis and equilibrium conditions.\nA. Energy Density and Pressure Components\nThe graphical representations of energy density, radial pressure and tangential pressure for considered stellar objects are shown in Fig. 2. The illustrated behavior indicates that the energy density and pressure components achieve their highest value at the core of the stellar stars and then approach zero on the surface boundary. These plots of \u03c1, pr and pt indicate that our system is consistent.\nThe graphical representation of the rate of change of energy density, radial pressure and tangential pressure i.e., d\u03c1 dr , dpr dr and dpt dr is zero at the center and becomes negative while moving towards boundary as seen in Fig. 3. The satisfactory results of these graphs indicate the stability of our proposed f(R, T ) model.\n6 B. Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff Equation for f(R, T ) Gravity\nThe equilibrium state is assumed to be the fundamental attribute in the analysis of compact objects. The geometrical structure of these objects is defined by the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation, which helps to explore the equilibrium conditions of stellar structures. The modified form of the generalized TOV equation for the f(R, T ) gravity is obtained with the help of Eq. (4) and Eq. (7) gives\n\u2212 \u03bd \u2032\nr (\u03c1+ pr)\u2212\ndpr\ndr +\n2 r (pt \u2212 pr) +\n2\u03b3 3(8\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3) d dr (3\u03c1\u2212 pr \u2212 2pt) = 0. (14)\nFirstly, Tolman [47] and then Oppenheimer and Volkoff [48] demonstrated the equilibrium condition of the stellar structures for the physically stable f(R, T ) model. They state that the combination of these forces, namely anisotropic force Fa, hydrostatic force Fh, gravitational force Fg and additional expression due to f(R, T ) modification Ffrt must be zero.\nFa + Fh + Fg + Ffrt = 0, (15)\nwhere, Fa = 2r\u2206, Fh = \u2212 dpr dr , Fg = \u2212 \u03bd \u2032 r (\u03c1 + pr) and Ffrt = 2\u03b33(8\u03c0\u2212\u03b3) ddr (3\u03c1\u2212 pr \u2212 2pt). The graphical representation of all forces can be seen in Fig. 4, which indicates that our system fulfills all equilibrium conditions and exhibits the viability of our chosen model.\nC. Energy Conditions\nThe discussion about the existence of an anisotropic configuration is about its physical attributes, such as its energy conditions. Moreover, these conditions are essential for determining the exotic behavior of matter within the compact structure model. Energy conditions are organized as dominant energy conditions (DEC), Null energy conditions (NEC), Weak energy conditions (WEC), and Strong energy conditions (SEC),\nDEC : \u03c1\u2212 pr > 0, \u03c1\u2212 pt > 0, NEC : \u03c1+ pr \u2265 0, \u03c1+ pt \u2265 0,\nWEC : \u03c1 \u2265 0, \u03c1+ pr \u2265 0, \u03c1+ pt \u2265 0, SEC : \u03c1+ pr \u2265 0, \u03c1+ pt \u2265 0, \u03c1+ pr + 2pt \u2265 0.\nThe graphical analysis of all the energy conditions such as NEC, WEC, SEC and DEC are satisfied and can be seen in Fig. 5, which justifies that our star is viable.\nD. Equation of State (EoS) Parameters\nIn literature, there are different types of equation of state parameters. For our current work, we consider two types of EoS parameters namely radial EoS parameter and transverse EoS parameter, defined as\nwr = pr\n\u03c1 , wt =\npt \u03c1 . (16)\nThe graphical representation of these two parameter can be seen in Fig. 6, which clearly shows that 0 < wr, wt < 1. It suggests that the nature of our system is well-behaved.\nE. Anisotropy\nWe investigate the internal structure of relativistic compact stars with the help of anisotropic factor defined as \u2206 = pt \u2212 pr [58]. The anisotropic factor is the inward direction when pt < pr, indicating \u2206 < 0, but in the case of pt > pr, the direction of the anisotropy is outward, which implies \u2206 > 0 [59]. The anisotropy for a chosen f(R, T ) gravity model demonstrates a repulsive behavior as seen in Fig. 7.\nF. Mass-Radius Relationship, Compactness factor and Surface Redshift Evolution\nBy utilizing metric potential g\u2212rr = g + rr, the mass function [60] is derived by\nM(r) = r(e Ar2 \u2212 1) 2eAr2 . (17)\nIt can be seen from the left panel of Fig. 8 that the graphical representation of mass function is increasing as we move towards boundary, which means that mass is uniform at the center, i.e. M(r) \u2192 0 as r \u2192 0. Furthermore, the compactness parameter U(r) [61] and surface redshift Zs [62] have the following mathematical configuration:\nU(r) = 2M(r) r = 1\u2212 1 eAr 2 , (18)\nZs = 1\u221a 1\u2212 2\u03bd \u2212 1. (19)\nThe physical illustrations of compactness parameter and surface redshift is positive as well as increasing nature similar to mass function, shown in the middle and right panel of Fig. 8.\nG. Causality Condition and Stability Analysis\nHere, we discuss the stability analysis in f(R, T ) theory of gravity. The causality condition plays a significant role for the discussion of realistic stars. The sound speed of the pressure waves must be less than the speed of the light waves when f(R, T ) model exhibits an internal configuration. When it comes to anisotropic fluids, the causality condition of the pressure waves arises in radial and transverse directions. Therefore, both components must be restricted to the speed of light to achieve a physically consistent f(R, T ) model. The causality condition is based on the following expression\nvr 2 =\ndpr\nd\u03c1 , vt\n2 = dpt\nd\u03c1 , (20)\n9 where, vr 2 stands for radial sound speed and vt\n2 represents the transverse sound speed. For a physically stable celestial structure, the radial and transverse sound speeds must be the range [0, 1]. We use the Herrera approach [63] (i.e.0 \u2264 v2r , v2t \u2264 1) to explore the stability of our f(R, T ) model. Also, to ensure the consistent behaviour of our proposed model, we considered the Andreasson condition [64] i.e. |vr2 \u2212 vt2| \u2264 1. It is significant to indicate that f(R, T ) model under analysis is fully balanced, as seen in Fig. 9.\nV. CONCLUSION\nVarious modified theories are considered a fundamental aspect of astrophysics to investigate the complex nature of the stellar configuration. Among all modified theories, cosmologists are especially interested in f(R, T ) gravity because of its unique combination of curvature and matter. Also, f(R, T ) demonstrated several remarkable results in the area of thermodynamics, cosmology, and the astrophysics of relativistic stars. Several promising outcomes indicate that f(R, T ) gravity has already been probed in astrophysics. Our goal is to study the precise nature of stellar stars while regarding the realistic f(R, T ) gravity model. To accomplish our objective, we presume the metric potentials using the Krori-Barua model, \u03bd(r) = Br2+C and \u03bb(r) = Ar2, where A, B, and C are unknowns. Further, to evaluate these constants compare the internal geometry to the exterior Schwarzschild sphere. The graphical representations of several compact stars ensure the consistency of our results. The main focus is to achieve an appropriate family of f(R, T ) gravity solutions in anisotropic distribution. The prominent findings are detailed below:\n\u2022 It is common practice to describe the nature of spacetime using metric potentials. Fig. 1 indicates that the metric potentials gtt = e \u03bd and grr = e \u03bb have positive, singularity-free graphs that satisfy all conditions i.e.,\ne\u03bd(r=0) = eC and e\u03bb(r=0) = 1. The evolution of both potentials shows satisfactory results since these graphs increase monotonically, indicating the validity of the f(R, T ) gravity model.\n\u2022 Fig. 2 demonstrates the behavior of the density and pressure components for the f(R, T ) gravity model. It is also clear that plots of \u03c1, pr, and pt obtain their maximum values at the center and exhibit a decreasing response toward the boundary, which consistency the stability of our model.\n\u2022 Fig. 3 shows the gradient of the pressure components and energy density. These graphs show negative illustrations, indicating that our outcomes are reliable.\n\u2022 All forces Fh, Fg, Fa, and Ffrt are steady and show balancing behavior, as seen in Fig. 4.\n\u2022 Fig. 5 provides the energy bonds for the proposed f(R, T ) model. It is important to highlight that our model satisfies all energy conditions.\n\u2022 The physical illustration of EoS parameters satisfy the conditions 0 \u2264 wr and wt \u2264 1 for the compact objects to behave precisely. Fig. 6 exhibits that the nature of both EoS ratios are steady.\n\u2022 The graphical representation of anisotropy in Fig. 7 illustrates the stable and repulsive nature of the stellar star.\n\u2022 From Fig. 8, it is easy to notice that the mass function, compactness factor, and surface redshift increase monotonically.\n\u2022 The parameters of sound velocity v2r and v 2 t lie between [0, 1] for the proposed f(R, T ) model. The stability\nconstraints for our model are stable, as shown in Fig. 9.\n10\nModified f(R, T ) gravity plays an alluring role in the study of stellar structures. Also, it is significant to note that our obtained outcomes are much similar to the results discussed by Shamir et al. [25] in f(R) gravity. Thus we conclude that our f(R, T ) model in the frame of anisotropic fluid is stable and consistent, as all physical characteristics of compact objects obey physically obtained patterns.\n[1] A. V.
