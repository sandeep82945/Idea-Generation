At the same time, the study further explored the advantages and disadvantages of the dispersed ownership structure, the long-term impact on the company\u2019s development and the choice of the involved corporate governance methods under the current Chinese capital market conditions. This paper adopted the event research method and selected the period from June 2015 to June 2017 (24 months) as the observation period to analyze the market performance impact of Vanke in the equity disputes. At the same time, this paper also measured Vanke\u2019s individual stock rate of return (Rit) and market rate of return (Rmt), and calculated Vanke\u2019s normal rate of return [E(Ri,t)], abnormal rate of return (ARi,t), and cumulative abnormal rate of return (CARi) during different event windows ([\u22123,10]). Vanke\u2019s shareholding was too dispersed and the stock price had been sluggish for a long time, which had greatly reduced the acquisition difficulty and cost of Baoneng, thus triggering the \u201cbarbarian invasion\u201d of Baoneng. In the struggle for control, whether it was Vanke\u2019s anti-takeover measures or China Resources, Baoneng, and Evergrande\u2019s competition for equity, their actions had harmed the interests of small and medium shareholders. The market supervision department was too lenient to supervise and punish the interests of small and medium shareholders, and opportunism made behaviors that infringe on the interests of others more reckless. However, small and medium shareholders cannot actively participate in the company\u2019s management decision-making to safeguard their legitimate rights and interests, which intensifies the violations of all parties in the equity disputes, thus forming a vicious circle. Therefore, the protection of the interests of small and medium shareholders required the joint efforts and consciousness of regulators, small and medium shareholders, and acquirers.\nKeywords: small and medium shareholders, dispersed ownership structure, equity disputes, interest protection, corporate governance\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 1 May 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 857585"

            "text": "China\u2019s capital market has developed for more than 20 years and has achieved good results in financing and investment. However, when we talk about the stock market, we overemphasize its financing function, while ignoring that it is also a place for resource allocation and investment (Hayes and Lundholm, 1996; Hoberg and Phillips, 2016). Whether it was the stock market crash in 2007 or the market crash in 2015, the biggest losses were among small and medium shareholders (Bernard et al., 2006; Hughes et al., 2007; Armstrong et al., 2011; Dye and Hughes, 2018). If the stock market has become a place where \u201cmakers,\u201d traders and listed companies wantonly plunder the interests of small and medium shareholders to satisfy their selfish desires, thus causing unbearable economic losses to small and medium shareholders, how can small and medium shareholders get involved in such a market? How can the capital market continue to move forward without the participation of small and medium shareholders (Christensen et al., 2010; Bertomeu et al., 2011; Corona and Lin, 2013; Caskey et al., 2015)? Therefore, from this perspective, protecting the interests of small and medium shareholders plays a vital role in the prosperity and development of China\u2019s stock market.\nThe protection of the interests of small and medium shareholders involves the issue of principal\u2013agent, and the principal\u2013agent issue of management and shareholders has always been the basic problem in the corporate governance structure (Lemmon and Lins, 2003; Jessica, Weber, 2018). Among them, the ownership structure is one of the most core issues in corporate governance. An appropriate shareholding structure can not only help shareholders alleviate the \u201cinsider problem,\u201d but also establish a monitoring mechanism for the behavior of large shareholders (Hodges et al., 2014). Seeking an equity structure suitable for corporate development should be the primary arrangement for corporate strategic development. Perfect corporate governance is not only an effective guarantee for modern companies to enhance their comprehensive competitiveness and performance capabilities, but also an important factor in attracting public investment investors (Robert, 1983). The combination of equity and governance can effectively help companies maximize corporate value and shareholder value.\nThe shareholding structure of Chinese listed companies is mostly highly concentrated, and the phenomenon of dominance caused by this is relatively common in China. Research showed that a highly concentrated ownership structure can solve the free-riding behavior of small and medium shareholders under a dispersed ownership structure. However, since other shareholders cannot effectively restrain large shareholders, absolute controlling shareholders can threaten the interests of small and medium shareholders by interfering with the management or colluding with them (Gebhardt et al., 2001; Francis et al., 2005; Fresard, 2010; Chen et al., 2014; Dhaliwal et al., 2016). A highly dispersed ownership structure can prevent the interests of major shareholders from infringing on the interests of small and medium shareholders, but it will also bring about the contradiction between the company\u2019s public goods and the private costs of supervision.\nThis research can study the governance issues of Vanke and the protection of the interests of small and medium investors in the case of dispersed ownership structure. At the same time, this study can also further explore the advantages and disadvantages of dispersed ownership structure, the long-term impact on the company\u2019s development, and the choice of corporate governance methods under the current Chinese capital market conditions.

Equity concentration will create a dominant phenomenon, which creates opportunities for large shareholders to hollow out small shareholders (Hail and Leuz, 2009; Christensen et al., 2010; Cheynel, 2013). The dispersed ownership structure can help to solve the problem that the company may have a dominant shareholder, but it may cause the insider control of the management.\nThe company\u2019s shareholding structure is not in one-to-one correspondence with the internal and external mechanisms, that is, the dispersed shareholding does not mean that the external mechanism of the company must be good. Likewise, a high concentration of equity does not imply that internal mechanisms are functioning properly (Lang et al., 2004, 2012; Jeng and Pak, 2016). When both the internal mechanism and the external mechanism of the enterprise fail to deal with the principal\u2013 agent problem, the interest disputes between the large or small shareholder, the management, and the shareholder will exist within an enterprise at the same time."

After the sharetrading reform, the higher the company\u2019s tradable shares, the greater the improvement in company performance (Hail and Leuz, 2009; Antoniou et al., 2016; Bertomeu and Cheynel, 2016). However, considering that most of the largest shareholders of domestic listed companies are sponsor shareholders, although the internal mechanism can reduce agency costs, it also creates convenience for the absolute controlling shareholder to control the management, conduct related transactions, occupy funds, and other behaviors that will reduce the company\u2019s performance (Gode and Mohanram, 2003). Therefore, the concentration of the company\u2019s ownership structure and the performance of the company are negatively correlated (Lambert et al., 2007).\nSome scholars also pointed out that the more concentrated the company\u2019s equity, the better the company\u2019s performance. From the perspective of operation, the higher the company\u2019s equity concentration, the better the company\u2019s operating performance, and the two show a positive correlation (Easley et al., 2002;\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 May 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 857585\nBotosan and Stanford, 2005; Papakroni, 2013). The performance of equity-concentrated companies is significantly better than that of equity-diversified companies, especially in an environment with immature capital markets, unsound laws, and insufficient investor protection. But at the same time, due to the existence of the absolute controlling shareholder (Ali et al., 2014), the interests of the small and medium shareholders have been damaged, so the centralized ownership structure is necessary to diversify the shareholding (Shleifer and Vishny, 1997)."

            "text": "In a company with a high concentration of equity, the encroachment of small and medium shareholders is mainly manifested in the damage of the interests of small and medium shareholders by the controlling shareholder. Lemmon and Lins (2003) analyzed Asian listed companies in the economic crisis: due to the separation of control rights and cash flow rights caused by the pyramid ownership structure, the rights of controlling shareholders were expanded, which made large shareholders tend to encroach on the interests of small and medium shareholders, and the greater the degree of separation between the two, the more serious this phenomenon was (Minutiello and Tettamanzi, 2022).\nIn a dispersed ownership structure, this kind of infringement is often caused by management, which can be mitigated through equity incentives (Francis et al., 2008; Dhaliwal et al., 2011). When the external capital market is imperfect, the internal mechanism is imperfect, and the protection of investors is insufficient, the management will control the formulation and implementation of equity incentives (Kammoun and Djerry, 2021). This makes this incentive a way for management to gain vested interests rather than protect shareholder interests.\nWhen the shareholding level of large shareholders is maintained between 35 and 63%, the proportion of large shareholders\u2019 equity increases, and the private interests obtained by large shareholders out of small shareholders are more difficult to compensate for the loss of cash flow rights (Petersen, 2009; Suijs and Wielhouwer, 2019). Therefore, within this range, the increase of the large shareholder\u2019s equity will have a positive effect on corporate performance. The high concentration of equity is actually a substitute for the lack of legal protection of shareholders\u2019 interests. Therefore, from another perspective, highly concentrated equity is actually a protection for shareholders, but it is more focused on large shareholders (Chen, 2018; Li et al., 2021). The centralized ownership structure can prevent insider control and reduce agency costs, but it has a \u201ctunnel effect.\u201d Therefore, we should focus on how to protect the interests of small and medium shareholders for the prevailing dominance phenomenon in our country."

However, in some special cases, shareholders within a company with a dispersed ownership\nstructure may boycott the acquisition, which will be detrimental to the realization of the acquisition (Collins, 2011; Thomas, 2010). The equity alliance formed by different shareholders within the enterprise can resist the market\u2019s acquisition of the company, and a solid alliance structure can never let the acquirer retreat or put the acquisition in a huge predicament (Cohen and Malkogianni, 2021.\nThe consensus view of most scholars is that, compared with companies with concentrated ownership, companies with dispersed ownership are more likely to compete for control rights. Suijs and Wielhouwer (2019) explained the relationship between ownership structure and control rights from the perspective of company value (Orhun, 2019). He established a company value model, and found that the contention for control can improve the value of a company with a dispersed ownership structure, but it is the opposite for a company with a centralized ownership structure. Shleifer and Vishny, 1997 believed that shareholders cannot effectively supervise management, which is prone to principal\u2013agent problems, and the control market will introduce external large shareholders to supervise management, which is more likely to lead to control competition."

The founder WANG Shi tried to restrict Baoneng \u2019s acquisition by introducing Shenzhen Metro, but was unexpectedly opposed by the \u201cformer owner\u201d China Resources. The prolonged suspension\nand struggle to deal with acquisitions have had a severe negative impact on Vanke\u2019s performance.\nVarious deeds in the equity disputes showed that Vanke\u2019s ownership structure was difficult to stabilize the company\u2019s control, and at the same time, it cannot effectively reduce the adverse impact of hostile takeovers on the company\u2019s long-term development. In fact, it was precisely because the equity setting was unreasonable that it led to the competition for its control rights, which ultimately damaged the interests of small and medium shareholders."

The founder WANG Shi has a huge responsibility in the company\u2019s operation and has played a pivotal role in Vanke\u2019s development and growth into the world\u2019s best real estate developer. But in fact, China Resources, as the largest shareholder, rarely participates in the company\u2019s operations, and has not achieved real control.\nIn Table 6, Guoxin Jinpeng No. 1 was a business partner system launched by Vanke\u2019s management in 2014, that is, Vanke\u2019s internal employees hold shares. Vanke executives represented by WANG Shi and YU Liang hardly hold the company\u2019s stock, but they had long held the actual control of the company. Their decision-making in the battle for control was even more deviated from the interests of shareholders, and even in order to maintain their control, they used actions such as suppressing the stock price, hasty suspension of trading, and reorganization of shares. They had completely disregarded the interests of small and medium shareholders."

For another example, Vanke\u2019s forced trading suspension was suspected of insider trading, and the management did not comply with the fairness principle in the information disclosure system.\nSecond, the punishment is not strong. The various behaviors of all parties in this control right struggle have damaged the legitimate rights and interests of small and medium shareholders. However, the regulatory authorities did not take appropriate measures against the relevant personnel. This is more of an extrajudicial favor to the parties involved in the battle for control. Whether it was the management\u2019s hasty suspension or the acquirer\u2019s abuse of information disclosure, they were only criticized by the regulatory authorities without further disciplinary measures.\nFinally, the litigation system is flawed. In this competition for control rights, in the face of the company\u2019s management\u2019s many\nreckless behaviors, the small and medium shareholders have no right to appeal for protection when their own rights and interests have been violated."

On June 18, 2016, in Vanke\u2019s proposal to introduce Shenzhen Metro, ZHANG Liping had a relationship with the company\u2019s production and operation, but served as an independent director of the company. The economics and independence of independent directors had been severely affected. Obviously, ZHANG Liping should not continue to serve as an independent director of Vanke.\nSecond, independent directors were suspected of revealing company secrets. In addition, during equity disputes, independent director HUA Sheng repeatedly published highly targeted and offensive remarks in the public media, including criticism of the company\u2019s management, opposition to large shareholders and the details of the board\u2019s decision-making. This was not in line with the code of conduct for the position in the first place, and its compliance legitimacy had been questioned.\nFinally, the independent directors were suspected of not fully performing their duties. In this equity disputes, WANG Shi publicly doubted the rationality of Baoneng becoming the largest shareholder of Vanke in the media, and then HUA Sheng began to question the motive and ability of Baoneng \u2019s acquisition in the article. However, the independent directors representing the interests of small and medium shareholders did not raise any different opinions. This had made it hard to believe that the independent director system of Vanke really fully performs its duties."

It can not only play a warning role, but also effectively curb the recurrence of violations of relevant regulations (Jonathan Lewellen, 2015)."

            "text": "This paper took the equity dispute of Vanke as the background, and mainly studied the damage to the interests of small and medium shareholders in the equity dispute. This paper mainly drew the following conclusions:\nFirst of all, the highly dispersed ownership structure is the main reason why Vanke has encountered equity dispute. Vanke\u2019s shareholding is too dispersed and the stock price has been sluggish for a long time, which has greatly reduced the acquisition difficulty and cost of Baoneng, thus triggering Baoneng \u2019s brutal invasion. The dispersed ownership structure also led to Vanke\u2019s long-term insider control of the management. There was a backlash from management to defend its control when the company faced a hostile takeover. The above two factors eventually led to the occurrence of the Vanke equity dispute.\nSecond, in the struggle for control, neither the management, major shareholders nor acquirers take into account the interests of small and medium shareholders. Whether it is the antitakeover measures taken by the management of Vanke, or the equity dispute by China Resources, Baoneng, and Evergrande, their actions have actually caused damage to the interests of small and medium shareholders.\nFinally, the protection of the interests of small and medium shareholders is imminent. The regulatory authorities are too\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 11 May 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 857585\nlenient to supervise and punish all parties that harm the interests of small and medium shareholders, and the existence of opportunism makes them more reckless with their actions that infringe on the interests of others. However, the small and medium shareholders lack effective ways to safeguard their legitimate rights and interests by participating in the company\u2019s management decision-making, which intensifies the violations of all parties in the equity dispute, thus forming a vicious circle.\nAt present, my country\u2019s regulatory agencies, listed companies or small and medium shareholders themselves lack substantial measures to protect the interests of small and medium shareholders. In the subsequent research process, this paper hopes to use other research methods to conduct a more comprehensive and systematic analysis of the large sample data of the capital market, so as to draw universal conclusions."
