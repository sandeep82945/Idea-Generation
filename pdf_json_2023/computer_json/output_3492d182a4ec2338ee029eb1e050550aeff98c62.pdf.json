Using these techniques, we will develop controller synthesis techniques for sampled-data control systems, which can be modelled as a special type of linear periodic jump-flow systems. We will present three applications of these synthesis techniques: 1) passivity-based controller synthesis, as found in teleoperations, 2) input-ouput-response matching of a continuous-time filter with a discrete-time filter (by minimizing the H\u221e-norm of a generalized plant) and 3) a sampled-data controller redesign problem, where the objective is to find the best sampled-data controller, in the H\u221e-norm sense, for a given continuous-time controller. We will show that synthesising sampled-data controllers leads to better closed-loop system behaviour than using a Tustin discretization of a continuous-time controller.",

            "text": "The vast majority of controller implementations have shifted from analogue to digital controllers over the last century. This paradigm shift has let to research on systems that have mixed continuous/discrete behaviour because the processor in-the-loop experiences discrete-time while the dynamics of the to-be-controlled process experiences continuous-time (Rosenwasser & Lampe 2000, A\u030astro\u0308m & Wittenmark 2011). This research is motivated by performance loss, and possibly instability, when discretizing continuous-time controllers for implementation on micro-controllers. When the hybrid nature of such systems is taken into account explicitly, performance and stability can be quantified and guaranteed, respectively, see e.g., (Chen & Francis 2012, Bamieh & Pearson 1992, Bamieh et al. 1991, Mirkin & Palmor 1997, Khargonekar & Sivashankar 1991).\nControl systems, in which the controller is implemented digitally and is explicitly incorporated in the design process, are called sampled-data (SD) control systems. SD control systems are comprised of a continuous-time plant and sampler, a discrete-time controller and a hold device in closed-loop. This allows for direct design of a discrete-time controller for a continuous-time plant (Chen & Francis 2012). In the 90s, SD control design\nEmail addresses: l.m.spin@tue.nl (L.M. Spin), m.c.f.donkers@tue.nl (M.C.F. Donkers).\nwas very successful due to a technique called \u2018lifting\u2019, see, e.g., (Bamieh & Pearson 1992, Bamieh et al. 1991, Khargonekar & Sivashankar 1991). While lifting transforms a SD system into an equivalent infinitedimensional discrete-time system, it is not directly applicable for systems that have discrete-time inputs and outputs (Mirkin & Palmor 1997), thereby limiting its applicability. Alternatively, the SD system can be modelled as a system with delayed measurements, where the (time-varying) delay is reset to zero at every sampling instant, see, e.g., (Fridman 2014), though some conservatism is introduced in the analysis as the integral terms in the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional are typically approximated, see (Hetel et al. 2017). Finally, SD systems can be modeled as linear periodic jump-flow systems (LPJF), which form a distinct class of hybrid dynamical systems (Goebel et al. 2012b), which does not suffer from the aforementioned limitations.\nIn recent years, a lot of attention has been given to deriving system theoretic properties of LPJF systems such as stability and notions of controllability and observability, see (Possieri & Teel 2016). Advancements in this area have enabled designing stabilizing controllers for LPJF systems, see, e.g., the results presented in (Ichikawa et al. 2001, Sivashankar & Khargonekar 1994). However, the presented results are not computationally attractive. The computational aspect of analysis and controller synthesis for LPJF systems is improved by employing differential linear matrix inequalities (DLMIs). Fruitful analysis and synthesis techniques\nPreprint submitted to Automatica 5 April 2023\nar X\niv :2\n30 4.\n01 87\n8v 1\n[ ee\nss .S\nY ]\n4 A\npr 2\nhave been developed by (Geromel et al. 2019, Holicki & Scherer 2020). A DLMI can be turned into numerically tractable linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) by restricting the unknown variable to be polynomial and applying the matrix sum-of-square (SOS) approach (Parrilo 2000, Scherer & Hol 2006). Another approach is to assume the unknown variable to be piecewise linear, see (Briat 2013). These assumptions reduce the solution space of the general DLMI and can introduce conservatism. For the particular case of SD systems, it is shown that these DLMIs can be turned into one equivalent LMI and no conservatism is introduced, see (Dreef & Donkers 2021, Heemels et al. 2012).\nIn this paper, we aim to generalize the LMI-based analysis results for SD systems presented in (Dreef & Donkers 2021) towards a dissipativity-based framework for LPJF systems, particularly, for so-called generalized plants. These results will be used to analyse dissipativity, which has been introduced for linear time-invariant systems in (Willems 1972), of generalized plant LPJF systems. We will also particularize to passivity and H\u221e-norm analysis. Subsequently, we will consider SD systems, which are LPJF systems that do not have an control input in the flow dynamics (as the controller can only update during the jump), and present controller synthesis results that render the SD system dissipative with respect to a quadratic storage function. We will also particularize the SD controller synthesis results to passivity and the H\u221e-norm. Compared to (Dreef & Donkers 2021), the SD H\u221e controller synthesis results will allow for more general generalized plant formulations. Finally, we will present applications of the presented synthesis results to three classes of control design problems. The first application is the synthesis of passive controllers for teleoperations, the second application is a SD filter-matching problem, where the objective is to match the response of a continuous-time filter with a discrete-time filter by minimizing the H\u221e-norm of the difference between the SD and the continuous-time filter, and the third application is a SD controller redesign problem. In this latter problem, the objective is to find the best SD controller, in the H\u221e-norm sense, for a given continuous-time controller. For all three problems, we obtain better closedloop system behaviour than using a Tustin discretization of a continous-time controller.\nThe paper is organized as follows. After introducing some notational conventions below, Section 2 will define state-space models for LPJF systems and the notion of generalized plants used in this paper, and will present SD systems as a special class of LPJF systems. Stability and dissipativity analysis of LPJF systems is treated in Section 3, and these results will be used for controller synthesis of SD systems in Section 4. Subsequently, we will present and illustrate the three classes of design problems in Section 5. Lastly, conclusions will be drawn in Section 6.\nNomenclature The sets R, R>0, N and C denotes the real numbers, non-negative real numbers, non-negative integer and the complex numbers, respectively, and D = {s \u2208 C | |s| < 1} denotes the open unit disc. The transpose of a matrix A \u2208 Rn\u00d7m, is denoted by A> \u2208 Rm\u00d7n, and when the matrix is square, i.e., n = m, its eigenvalues are denoted by \u03bb, its spectrum is denoted by \u039b(A) = {\u03bb1, ..., \u03bbn}, and its spectral radius by \u03c1(A), which is the eigenvalue with the biggest magnitude. The notation A 0, A < 0, A \u227a 0, and A 4 0 denotes that A = A> is positive definite, nonnegative definite, negative definite and nonpositive definite, respectively. The zero matrix and identity matrix are denoted by 0 and I, respectively. For brevity, we write symmetric matri-\nces of the form\n[ A B\nB> C\n] as [ A ?\nB> C\n] . For a vector x \u2208 Rn,\nwe denote by \u2016x\u2016 := \u221a x>x its 2-norm. For a signal x : N \u2192 Rn, we denote by \u2016x\u2016`2 = \u221a\u2211\u221e\nk=0 \u2016x[k]\u20162 its `2-norm, and for a signal x : R\u22650 \u2192 Rn, we denote by \u2016x\u2016L2 = \u221a\u222b\u221e 0 \u2016x(t)\u20162dt its L2-norm, provided that these quantities are finite. Finally, the left limit of a signal x(t) in the time interval (tk, tk+1] is denoted as x(t+k ) = limt\u2193tk x(t)."

Throughout this paper, we assume that the matrices DFF and DJJ are zero, which may be done without loss of generality (Zhou et al. 1996).\nThe plant (1) will be interconnected with a controller that has the following state-space realization:\nK :  x\u0307k(t) = AkFx k(t) +BkFyF(t) xk(t+k ) = A k Jx k(tk) +B k J yJ[k] uF(t) = C k Fx k(t) +DkFyF(t)\nuJ[k] = C k Jx k(tk) +D k JyJ[k],\n(2)\nwith controller state xk(t) \u2208 Rnk , leading to a closedloop LPJF system, consisting of (1) and (2), with state \u03be(t) = [xp(t) xk(t)]> \u2208 Rnp+nk that is given by\nT :  \u03be\u0307(t) = Ac\u03be(t) + Bcwc(t) \u03be(t+k ) = Ad\u03be(tk) + Bdwd[k] zc(t) = Cc \u03be(t) +Dcwc(t) zd[k] = Cd \u03be(tk) +Ddwd[k],\n(3)\nwith the closed-loop state-space matrices given by Ac Bc Cc Dc =  Apc +B p FD k FC p F B p FC k F B p c +B p FD k FD p Fc BkFC p F A k F B k FD p Fc\nCpc +D p cFD k FC p F D p cFC k F D p cc+D p cFD k FD p Fc  (4a)Ad Bd\nCd Dd\n=  Apd+B p JD k JC p J B p JC k J B p d+B p JD k JD p Jd BkJC p J A k J B k JD p Jd\nCpd +D p dJD k JC p J D p dJC k J D p dd+D p dJD k JD p Jd . (4b)\nFor the analysis and synthesis results that will be presented in this paper, it is important to know whether a controller (2) exists for the plant (1) that renders (3) globally exponentially stable (GES), which means that all solutions satisfy \u2016\u03be(t)\u2016 6 ce\u2212\u03b1t\u2016\u03be(0)\u2016 for all \u03be(0) and for some c, \u03b1 > 0.

            "text": "For the controller synthesis results in Section 4, we will focus on SD systems, where it is the objective to synthese DT controller for CT plants. The control structure is schematically shown in Fig. 1, in which P\u0303 denoted the to-be-controlled plant and Hh denotes the hold device that constrains the CT input and the DT input, andK is the to-be-designed controller. Such synthesis problems can be formulated using LPJF systems with P = P\u0303Hh. When compared to the general LPJF plant (1), a plant in SD control does not have a flow output yP, and the flow inputs uF is related to the jump input uJ, as the SD controller only updates the control inputs at the sampling time. As argued in (Dreef & Donkers 2021), and as also will be shown in Section 5 of this paper, it is still important to consider jump dynamics. The effect of discrete-time weighing filters that express performance requirements are described by the jump matrices of (1).\nThe above restrictions of the general LPJF for SD systems leads to a state-space model for the plant given by\nP\u0303 :  x\u0307(t) = Acx(t) + Bc wc(t) + Bcuu(t) x(t+k ) = Adx(tk) + Bd wd[k] +Bduu\u0302[k] zc(t) = Ccx(t) + Dccwc(t) +Dcuu(t) zd[k] = Cdx(tk) +Dddwd[k] +Dduu\u0302[k]\ny[k] = Cyx(tk) +Dydwd[k]\n(7)\nwhere the CT input u(t) and the DT input u\u0302[k] is constrained by a generalized hold device given by\nHh :  x\u0307h(t) = Ahcx h(t) xh(t+k ) = A h dx h(tk) +B hu\u0302[k]\nu(t) = Chxh(t).\n(8)\nwhere choosing Ahc = A h d = 0, B h = Ch = I corresponds to a zero-order hold. It should be noted that, besides considering more general hold devices in (8), the plant description (7) is more general than the one used in (Dreef & Donkers 2021), where it was assumed that Bdu = 0 and Dcu = 0. Though this might seem a trivial extension, it will be shown in Section 5 that this extension is needed in order to apply the synthesis results of Section 4 to the considered design problems.\nBy combining the plant (7) with generalized hold device (8), we can arrive at a particular form of (1) with states xp = [x> (xh)>]> having matrices\nApc = [ Ac BcuC h\n0 Ahc\n] , Bpc = [ Bcu 0 ] , BpF = 0, (9a)\nApd = [ Ad 0\n0 Ahd\n] , Bpd = [ Bd 0 ] , BpJ = [ Bdu Bh ] , (9b)\nCpc =[Cc DcuC h ], Dpcc = Dcc, D p cF = 0, (9c) Cpd =[Cd 0 ], D p dd = Ddd, D p dJ = Ddu (9d) CpF = \u2205, D p Fc = \u2205, D p FF = \u2205, (9e) CpJ =[Cy 0 ], D p Jd = Dyd, D p JJ = 0.

This allows writing the interconnection between the SD plant (7), the generalized hold device (8) and controller (11), or equivalently, the LPJF system (1), with matrices (12), and the controller (11) as closed-loop LPJF system (3) with flow matrices Ac Bc\nCc Dc\n =  Apc 0 B p c 0 0 0\nCpc 0 D p cc  (12a) and the jump matrices, and its specific partitioning,\nAd Bd Cd Dd =  Apd 0 B p d 0 0 0\nCpd 0D p dd\n+  0 Bpu I 0\n0 Dpdu\n [ AcBc\nCcDc\n][ 0 I 0\nCpy 0D p yd\n] .\n(12b)\nBecause of the particular structure in the matrices (12), conditions for stabilizabily and detectability simplify and the following corollary provides a condition on when a SD plant is a generalized plant, and, consequently, whether a stabilizing controller exists.\nCorollary 2.1 System (1) with matrices (9) is a generalized plant if and only if it is stabilizable and detectable, i.e, if and only if\nrank ([ \u03a6h \u2212 \u03bbI BpJ ]) = np, (13a)\nrank ([\n\u03a6>h \u2212 \u03bbI (C p J e Apch)> ]>) = np.

We will first define dissipativity, which has been defined for linear time-invarient systems in (Willems 1972), and state results on when dissipativity implies GES. We will then focus on quadratic storage and supply functions and show that using techniques from (Goebel et al. 2012a, Heemels et al. 2012), tractable analysis conditions can be formulated in the form of an LMI, which will then be used to analyse passivity and the closed-loop system\u2019s H\u221e-norm. We start by defining dissipativity of the LPJF system.\nDefinition 3.1 The closed-loop LPJF system (3) is said to be dissipative with respect to the flow supply function\nsc : Rnwc \u00d7 Rnzc \u2192 R and jump supply function sd : Rnwd \u00d7 Rnzd \u2192 R, if there exists a storage function S : Rnp+nk \u00d7 R>0 \u2192 R such that S(\u03be(t1), t1)6S(\u03be(t0), t0)+ \u222b t1 t0 sc(wc(t),zc(t))dt+ N1\u2211 k=N0 sd(wd[k], zd[k]), (14) hold for all t1 > t0 and all \u03be(t1), \u03be(t0) 6= 0 and all wc, wd, zc and zd. Here, N0 \u2208 N denotes the smallest possible upper bound ofN0 > t0/h andN1 \u2208 N denotes the largest strict lower bound of N1 < t1/h. The system is said to be conservative with respect to sc and sd if there exists a storage function S such that equation (14) holds with equality.\nDissipativity will be characterized using the following dissipation inequalities.\nLemma 3.1 Whenever the storage function S(\u03be, t) is at least once differentiable over the interval (tk, tk+1] for all k \u2208 N and all \u03be \u2208 Rn\u03be , the inequality (14) is equivalent to\nS\u0307(\u03be(t), t) 6 sc(wc(t), zc(t)), for t \u2208 (tk, tk+1] (15a) S(\u03be(t+k ), t + k ) 6 S(\u03be(tk), tk) + sd(wd[k], zd[k]), (15b)\nwhere (15a) will be referred to as the flow dissipation inequality and (15b) will be referred to as the jump dissipation inequality.\nThe flow and jump dissipation inequalities can also be used to characterize stability, which is shown in the following lemma.\nLemma 3.2 Let sc and sd be the flow and jump storage functions, respectively, and let S : Rn\u03be \u00d7 R>0 \u2192 R>0 be a storage function that is continuously differentiable over the interval t \u2208 (tk, tk+1] for every k \u2208 N, satisfying S(\u03be, t) = 0 only when \u03be = 0 and satisfying c\u2016\u03be\u2016 6 S(\u03be, t) 6 c\u2016\u03be\u2016 for some c > c > 0 and for all t \u2208 R>0. Furthermore, assume that the supply functions satisfy\nsc(0, zc) 6 0 (16a) sd(0, zd) 6 0 (16b)\nwhere one of the inequalities holds strictly. Then, for wc = 0 and wd = 0, the origin of the LPJF system (3) is GES with Lyapunov function V (\u03be, t) = S(\u03be, t).\nPROOF. The flow and jump dissipation inequalities (15) together with the unforced supply functions sc(0, zc) and sd(0, zd) (with wc = 0 and wd = 0), and the assumption that S(\u03be, t) > 0 for all \u03be 6= 0 and all t \u2208 R>0, leads that V (\u03be, t) = S(\u03be, t) becomes a Lyapunov function for the LPJF system (3). Now using\nstandard Lyapunov arguments, we can conclude that the origin of the LPJF system (3) is GES."

The timer function \u03c4(t) is introduced, as in (Dreef & Donkers 2021), to emphasize the periodicity of P (\u00b7).

The proof is based on showing that the conditions in the theorem imply (15) to hold and that one of the supply functions is strictly negative, see (16). To do so, first substitute the quadratic supply (19) and storage functions (17) with the timer (18), realising this renders V (\u03be, t) periodic, into (15a), leading to [ P\u0307 (\u03c4) +A>c P (\u03c4) + P (\u03c4)AcP (\u03c4)Bc\nB>c P (\u03c4) 0\n] \u2212 [ M1 M3\nM>3 M2\n] 4 0,\n(23) for \u03c4 \u2208 (0, h]. Now applying a Schur complement to this expression, which requires M2 0, yields that this expression is satisfied by the satisfaction of (22a). Secondly, applying the same supply and storage function to (15b), leads to (22b) with a nonstrict inequality. Therefore, both conditions (15) are satisfied. Furhermore, the fact that (22b) holds strictly, implies that a storage function can be defined that renders (16b) with strict inequality, thereby rendering (3) GES."

We will first employ the passivity-based synthesis result for an application in teleoperations and will then continue with two examples that can be formulated as an H\u221e-norm minimization problem. The first of these examples is a filtermatching problem, where the objective is to match the frequency response of the CT filter with a DT filter, and the second is a closed-loop controller-matching problem, where the objective is to approximate the closed-loop response of an a priori designed CT controller interconnected with a CT plant by a DT controller interconnected to the same CT plant. Both matching examples will be shown to outperform traditional discretization methods. All the examples have been implemented using the PeriodicJumpFlowSystemsToolbox (Spin 2022)."

            "heading": "5.1 Application to teleoperations",
            "text": "In teleoperations, the objective is to let a human operator control a master device and that behaviour is replicated (as closely as possible) by a slave device that interacts with an unknown environment which is assumed to be passive (Hogan 1989). To let the human operator \u2018feel\u2019 the unknown environment, the slave device has to feed the perceived force back to the master device. To achieve this, a controller interconnects the master and slave device. Since the human operator and the environment are uncertain, it is typically assumed that these are passive systems. An important property of passive systems is that interconnections of passive systems are passive (Van der Schaft 2000). Therefore, if the master/slave system is passive, their interconnection with the human operator and the environment remains passive, and passivity can be used as a design tool in designing controller for teleoperation master/slave systems. In this example, we design a DT controller that controls the force of the CT master and CT slave system based on their position, see Fig. 2.\nIn the teleoperation system shown in Fig. 2, the master and slave devices are modelled using Newton\u2019s law with a certain mass mi and a viscous friction coefficent bi, where i \u2208 {m, s} where m and s refer to the master and slave device, respectively. The controller that interconnects the physically disconnected systems measures the master and slave position and calculates a force, while both the operator and the environment also apply\na force. This can be expressed using (7), with\nAc =  0 1 0 0\u2212kmmm \u2212bmmm 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 \u2212ksms \u2212bs ms , Bc = \u2212Bcu = [ 0 01mm 00 0 0 1ms ] ,\n(45a)\nCy =\n[ 1 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0\n] , Dyd = 0, Dyu = 0. (45b)\nIndeed, these matrices express the two physicallydisconnected master and slave device, where the operator and the environment apply a force, modelled through a vector wc(t). Since the system only evolves in CT, the DT dynamics of the plant are simply\nAd = I, Bd = 0, Bdu = 0. (45c)\nTo express the requirement on passiviy, it should be noted that the product between input wc and output zc should represent a power, meaning that if the inputs are forces, the outputs have to be velocities. This is expressed by Cc = [ \u03b1km \u03b1bm \u2212ks \u2212bs 0 1 0 \u22121 ] , Dcc = [ \u03b1 \u22121 \u2212\u03b5 \u03b5 ] , Dcu = [ \u03b1 \u22121 0 0 ] ,\n(45d)\nCd = \u2205, Ddd = \u2205, Ddu = \u2205, (45e)\nwhere \u03b5 is small in order to satisfy the constraintM2 0 and \u03b1 is sufficiently large in order to guarantee that the force feedback to the operator is small. In this example, we take parameters mm = 1 [kg], ms = 10 [kg], bm = 10\u22123 [Ns/m], bs = 10\n\u22122 [Ns/m], km = 10 [N/m], ks = 103 [N/m], = 10\u22122 and \u03b1 = 50.\nTo arrive at a complete LPJF system representation of the SD system given by (1) with matrices (12), we consider a zero-order hold (ZOH) and a first-order hold (FOH), which can be described by (8) with Ahc = A h d =\n0, Bh = Ch = I for the ZOH and\nAhc = [ 0 0 0 1 h I 0 \u2212 1 h I\n0 0 0\n] , Ahd = [ 0 0 0 I 0 0 I 0 0 ] , Bh = [ I 0 0 ] , Ch =[ 0 I 0 ]\n(46) for the FOH. This SD system description allows us to synthesize controller using the results of Corollary 4.1.\nUsing the passivity synthesis technique given in Corollary 4.1 a discrete-time controller is designed that renders the closed-loop stable and passive for both ZOH and FOH reconstructors irrespective of the sampling-time. It should be noted that when a continuous-time controller is synthesized using the positive-real lemma, see (Scherer & Weiland 2019), which is subsequently discretized using various discretization schemes and then analyzed for passivity using the analysis results in Corollary 3.1 does not render the closed-loop stable. In other words, the SD design approach results in a passive closed-loop system where the traditional design approach does not."

The block diagram of this problem is given in Fig. 3. Here, matching is interpreted as minimizing the H\u221e norm of the (weighted) difference between the two filters, i.e., minimizing the L2 \u00d7 `2-induced norm from the DT input wd[k] to the (weighted) CT output zc(t). We apply the inverse of the CT reference filter W cr to give every frequency equal emphasis in the synthesis problem. This requires the to-be-matched filter to be invertible.\nTo obtain a SD plant description of the form (7), we regard W dr as the to-be-designed controller, where the DT disturbance is directly fed to the output of the plant, i.e. y[k] = wd[k]. Furthermore, the CT filter is assumed to have a state-space realization given by\nW cr :  x\u0307(t) = Ax(t) +Br(t) x(t+k ) = Ix(tk)\nzr(t) = Cx(t) +Dr(t)\n(47a)\nand its inverse is given by\n(W cr ) \u22121 :  x\u0307(t) = (A\u2212BD\u22121C)x(t) +BD\u22121zr(t) x(t+k ) = Ix(tk)\nr(t) = \u2212D\u22121Cx(t) +D\u22121zr(t). (47b)\nIt can be verified that the operator (W cr ) \u22121W cr = I. Now the CT performance channel zc consists of the difference between (W cr )\n\u22121W crHh and the control input u(t) that is filtered by (W cr ) \u22121, i.e., zc(t) = Hhwd[k]\u2212 (W cr )\u22121u(t).\nThe hold function here is taken as\nHh :  x\u0307(t) = 0 x(t+k ) = wd[k]\nr(t) = x(t).\n(47c)\nCombining (47b) and (47c) with the fact that y[k] = wd[k] and zc(t) = Hhwd[k]\u2212(W cr )\u22121u(t), leads to a plant description of the form (7) with\nAc = [ A\u2212BD\u22121C 0\n0 0\n] , Bc = 0, Buc = [ BD\u22121\n0\n] , (48a)\nAd =[ I 00 0 ], Bd = [ 0 I ], Bud = 0 (48b) Cc =[D\u22121C I ], Dcc = 0, Dcu = \u2212D\u22121 (48c) Cd = \u2205, Ddd = \u2205, Ddu = \u2205 (48d) Cy = 0, Dyd = I, Dyu = 0 (48e)\nThis plant description can be used to synthesize a controller, which in this case is the DT filter W dr , using the results of Corollary 4.2. It should be noted that the plant description above requires Dcu 6= 0, meaning that the above problem could not have been solved using the plant description of (Dreef & Donkers 2021).\nTo illustrate the filter-matching problem, let us consider\na double notch filter described by the transfer function\nW cr (s) = s4 + 0.00289s3 + 43.03s2 + 0.1s+ 140.3\ns4 + 3.454s3 + 44.8s2 + 113.9s+ 140.3 (49)\nand a sampling time of h = 0.2 seconds. To assess the results, we compare the original CT filter with the result of the above filter-matching problem and several traditional discretization methods in terms of their Bode magnitude plot. The results are given in Fig. 4. It can be seen from the top plot that the Bode magnitude of the original filter (49) and the matched filter are very similar, while the ZOH and Tustin discretization of filter perform much worse. The bottom plot compares the matched filter with a FOH and a \u2018Tustin with prewarp\u2019 discretization, but this time in terms of error between the DT filter and the CT reference filter, as the differences are small. Still, it can be concluded that, for this example, the SD-filter-matching approach presented here gives better approximations than traditional discretization methods."

Besides matching the input-output behaviour of the CT controller, the DT controller is also required to render the closed-loop SD system stable, which is not guaranteed by directly discretizing the CT controller, using, e.g., a Tustin discretization.\nThe controller redesign problem is schematically shown in Fig. 5. In this figure, the system-to-be-controlled is assumed to be strictly proper and given by\nG : { x\u0307g(t) = Agxg(t) +Bgwwc(t) +B g uu(t)\nyg(t) = C gx(t)\n(50a)\nand the CT controller is given by\nKc : { x\u0307c(t) = Acxc(t) +Bce(t)\nu(t) = Ccxc(t) +Dce(t).

In the redesign problem, a SD controller Kd is interconnected with G through a sampler and a ZOH, where the SD controller takes e[k] = wd[k]\u2212Hhyg(t) as an input, where wd[k] is the DT reference. The objective is to minimize (in an H\u221e-sense) the difference between output of Kc and the ZOH-output of Kd for (any) disturbance wc acting on the to-be-controlled system G and (any) reference wd. This can be expressed in terms of operators\nzc(t) = Kc ( Hhwd[k]\u2212 G [ wc(t) u(t) ]) \u2212 u(t) (51a)\nwith plant output\ny[k] = wd[k]\u2212 ShG [ wc(t) u(t) ] (51b)\nwhere Sh denotes a sampler, that samples the CT plant output at time instances tk.

Kc(s) =\n1.747 \u00b7 105\ns+ 268.5 (53)\nrespectively. Note that in this example the CT disturbance wc is empty. We consider a sampling time of h = 0.03 [s] in this example. Because G is unstable, it needs to be verified if (50) is a generalized plant according to Corollary 2.1, which is the case for any state-space realization of G(s). Therefore, a DT controller can be synthesized using the results of Corollary 4.2. We compare this controller by a Tustin discretization of Kc(s) with the same sampling time. In Fig. 6, we compare\nthe step response of the closed-loop system given by G and Kc with the closed-loop formed by G and the tustin discretization of Kc, and the closed-loop systems formed by G and Kd, which results from the above redesign procedure. From this figure, we conclude that albeit some performance degradation is observed from the SD controller, the Tustin discretization fails to render the closed-loop systems stable. This demonstrates the need for having SD-controller-design methods, such as the ones presented in this paper."

Using these techniques, we have developed controller synthesis techniques for sampled-data control systems, which can be modelled as a special type of linear periodic jump-flow systems.\nThe results are applied to controller design for teleoperations that require passivity of the closed-loop system. It has been shown that using the sampled-datasynthesis techniques, a controller can be designed which renders the closed-loop system passive while sequential controller design and discretization does not render the closed-loop passive. Secondly, a filter-matching technique has been formulated, which minimizes the H\u221enorn and has been shown to produce a better approximation than traditional discretization techniques. Finally, the developed techniques have been shown to be applicable to the redesign of a given continuous-time controller as a sampled-data controller. The controller obtained through controller-matching is guaranteed to be stabilizing and has been shown to have better performance than the direct discretized version of the given continuous-time controller."
