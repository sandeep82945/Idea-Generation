The portions of the text mentioning future research directions are not explicitly highlighted in the provided text. However, the text concludes with a summary of findings and acknowledges the potential for new photocatalytic studies, which implicitly suggests areas for future research. Specifically, the conclusion states:

"Therefore, within the established conditions, the doped materials had excellent efficiency in MB degradation and showed promise for new photocatalytic studies."

This sentence implies that further research could explore the photocatalytic applications of doped materials, potentially expanding beyond methylene blue degradation to other pollutants or conditions.
