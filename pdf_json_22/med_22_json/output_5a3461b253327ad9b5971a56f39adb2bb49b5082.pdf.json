The incidence of OME recurrence was compared among four Veau classification groups based on the patients' sex, type of CP, median TT retention time, and type of fluid. Results: Seventy-six subjects (150 ears) were enrolled in the study. The median follow-up duration was 48.7 months (range, 18.2-108.0 months) after the first TT placement. A first TT retention time of <20.1 months was a significant risk factor for OME recurrence. Subjects with maxillofacial anomaly complex and subjects with cleft lip and palate and an alveolar cleft showed a significantly higher OME recurrence rate than subjects with clefts only in the hard and/or soft palate. There was no significant difference in the occurrence of sequelae between subjects with only a single TT placement and subjects with more than one TT placement. Conclusions: Based on the findings of the present study, it is reasonable to perform TT insertion at the same time as palatoplasty on patients who meet the indications.

            "text": "Cleft palate (CP) in children is frequently complicated by otitis media with effusion (OME) due to Eustachian tube dysfunction with an incidence of around 90% 1-3 . Such children often develop hearing difficulties and recurrent acute otitis media 3, 4. The sequelae of OME also include perforation, adhesion, and retraction of the tympanic membrane as well as other chronic changes such as myringosclerosis or tympanosclerosis, which can lead to moderate to severe hearing impairment later in life. Treating OME by tympanostomy tube (TT) insertion is one of the most common procedures to prevent adverse effects of hearing loss on speech and language development. Several previous reports have emphasized the importance of early placement of a TT because hearing plays a significant role in articulation training after palatoplasty by helping the patient to hear others' voices and pronounce words correctly by hearing their own voice during a critical period of growth and development 5, 6. Conductive hearing loss has been thought to have a significant impact on children's language and psychosocial development. Although this philosophy has gained some support, a more conservative approach is favored by others because of the risk of morbidity associated with repeated TT insertion, including persistent perforations and myringosclerosis. Although TT placement can be beneficial in the treatment of OME to prevent shortterm hearing loss 4, there is no consensus regarding the indication criteria or timing of TT insertion. A better understanding of the incidence of sequelae following TT insertion would help to determine the indication criteria for TT insertion. In the present study, no prophylactic TT insertion was performed; TTs were prescribed only for patients with persistent OME diagnosed by one otolaryngologist. The purpose of this study was to define the safety and effectiveness of simultaneous TT placement with palatoplasty during the language-acquisition period."

TT insertion was indicated\nwhen at least one of the following three conditions was present: (1) hearing loss of >45 decibels hearing level (dB HL), (2) type B tympanogram, or (3) soft tissue density indicating middle ear fluid on temporal bone computed tomography imaging.\nHearing examination (visual reinforcement audiometry) was conducted in a sound-proof room by\nan audiologist using a Rion AA-76 audiometer (until March 2016) or a Rion AA-78 audiometer (from April 2016) (Rion Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Hearing thresholds at octave frequencies from 0.25 to 4 kHz were measured. Hearing loss was defined as the average of a hearing threshold of >45 dB HL at four frequencies (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz) 8, 9. Tympanometry was conducted at 226 Hz by an audiologist using a Rion RS-21 audiometer (until March 2016) or a Rion RS-H1 audiometer (from April 2016) (Rion Co., Ltd.). The tympanogram was interpreted as type B when a poorly defined sharp peak was present with little or no variation in impedance over a wide range. A computed tomography scan was performed with a slice thickness of 0.5 mm and was reconstructed for the temporal bones. It contributes to the accurate evaluation of OME status and differential diagnosis of conductive hearing loss. Three-dimensional reconstructions of the maxillary and palatal bones were also made and used for the diagnosis and surgical planning of CP.\nA short-term tympanostomy ventilation tube (TympoVent Star Tube; Atos Medical Inc., Malm\u00f6,\nSweden) was placed at the anterior inferior quadrant of the tympanic membrane and maintained until the tube spontaneously fell out. If the patient had unilateral effusion, we placed a TT only on the affected side. The patients visited board-certified otolaryngologists every 3 months after TT placement until they reached at least 3 years of age without recurrence of OME. The TTs were removed from the tympanic membrane before spontaneous extrusion only when there was granulation tissue with repeated otorrhea around the TT that was resistant to conservative treatment. When recurrence of OME was diagnosed after spontaneous extrusion of the TTs, we placed the TTs again. Recurrence of OME after TT expulsion was defined by the same criteria described above. The TT retention time was defined as the time between TT placement and TT extrusion observed at the revisit."

            "text": "In general, about 50% of infants will develop OME during their first year of life, and this proportion increases to about 60% by the age of 2 years. In most cases, OME spontaneously resolves within 3 months, and only 5% to 10% of cases of OME last \u22651 year 10. In contrast, despite the fact that most newborns with\nCP pass the newborn hearing screening 11, infants with CP frequently develop OME within 6 months of age 1; the incidence of OME increases to approximately 90% during the first year 12 and to 97% by the age of 2 years 13. Eustachian tube dysfunction is a significant cause of OME in children with CP, and palatoplasty is thought to result in recovery of Eustachian tube function. However, compensation of Eustachian tube function takes an average of 6.0 years (range, 1.0-10.3 years) 14.\nOne study showed a significant negative association between a history of OME in early\nchildhood and receptive and expressive language in preschoolers without CP 15, whereas Majerus et al. 16 found no significant association between a history of repeated OME before the age of 3 years and verbal short-term memory and new word learning abilities at the age of 8 years in children without CP. Although tube placement can improve early hearing loss17, there is no consensus on the indications or appropriate duration of TT placement in patients with CP. Kobayashi et al.18 reported that tube placement for CP patients with OME is effective because there was no significant difference in language development at the age of 5 years between CP patients with or without OME when CP patients with OME underwent TT placement. In our hospital, speech therapists provide CP patients with postoperative articulation trainings and assessments for articulation and psychological development. Although it is uncertain whether the\nrecurrence of OME affects language development, we believe that early detection and treatment of the recurrence of OME could prevent subjects' language development from being affected. Some researchers suggest watchful waiting for OME in children with CP. Muntz 19 indicated that more than 50% of children with CP who develop OME naturally recover from OME after 3 years of age. During the observation period, patients may wear hearing aids to attain the same hearing threshold of children with TTs. In contrast to conservative management, some researchers recommended systematic TT placement in all children with CP because the TT might optimize air flow in the middle ear and thus reduce further complications. In a study by Skuladottir et al.20, patients with CP were prophylactically treated in both ears at the time of palatal closure in the most affected ear or both ears and followed up until the age of 15 years; the authors reported significant improvement in hearing levels from childhood to adolescence in\nthese patients. However, because TT insertion can cause serious sequelae, the risks of prophylactic TT insertion are currently considered to outweigh its benefits. Ponduri et al. 12 reported that there was insufficient evidence for a benefit of routine early tube insertion in children with CP on hearing and speech and language development. However, Phua et al. 21 compared patients who underwent routine TT insertion and patients who underwent conservative management favoring a selective approach to TT insertion, and better otologic outcomes and fewer tube insertions were noted in the latter group. The authors therefore recommended the use of TTs in children with CP only when they have symptomatic middle ear infection or significant hearing loss. 21 This idea can be supported in light of the fact that relief of effusions in the middle ears improves the accuracy of hearing level diagnosis and detection of underlying non-fluid-related, less reversible conductive hearing loss.\nIn addition, Maheshwar et al. 22 proposed that the use of TTs should be limited to only patients who have poor compliance with the use of hearing aids or who develop recurrent OME. Our findings regarding TT insertion in patients with CP are consistent with those of recent studies demonstrating that selective approaches are reasonable for OME in children with CP according to the type of CP or condition of the middle ear. Felton et al. 23 proposed that early TT placement (before palatoplasty) resulted in speech and audiology outcomes similar to those of children without CP and better than those of children with CP who underwent later TT placement (at or after palatoplasty). In addition, early TT placement is suggested to play a role in the development of the mastoid air cell system in children with CP 18, 24. However, when the first TT placement was performed before palatoplasty, the recurrence rate of OME is higher than in cases with first TT placement performed simultaneously with or after palatoplasty 25. Boston et al. 26 also concluded that children without CP aged <18 months at the time of first TT placement are 65% more likely to require subsequent TT placement than children aged >18 months. Our data regarding the OME recurrence rate of <20% suggest the usefulness of simultaneous TT placement with palatoplasty at the age of 1.0 to 1.5 years. It is difficult to assess language development of CP patients accurately. In addition, cultural differences; linguistic differences; community customs like medical insurance and compliance\nwith medical recommendations all affect the outcomes in patients. Therefore, development of consensus guidelines for the management of OME in children with CP may remain \"community specific\". Nevertheless, we consider that simultaneous TT placement with palatoplasty is reasonable if the patients meet the criteria because the cost and burden to perform TT placement under general anesthesia in pediatric patients are high."

            "heading": "4.2. Risk factors for recurrence of OME",
            "text": "Our data demonstrated a significant correlation between the CP type and OME recurrence. Frequent complications of OME in pediatric patients with CP are thought to be caused by Eustachian tube dysfunction, which is the result of aberrations of the levator veli palatini muscle and tensor veli palatini muscle (the muscles primarily responsible for Eustachian tube opening) 27. Whereas palatoplasty in the present study focused on constructing a paratubal muscle sling, the risk of recurrence of OME after palatoplasty remained higher in Groups 3 and 4 (subjects with cleft lip and palate) than in Groups 1 and 2 (subjects with soft and hard CP). These results are considered reasonable because it takes an average of 6.0 years (range, 1.0-10.3 years) to recover Eustachian tube function after palatoplasty 14. Even when palatoplasty is performed, a more severe CP type may be associated with less mature Eustachian tube function. Another significant risk factor for OME recurrence in this study was the first TT retention time. The shorter first TT retention time raises the risk for OME recurrence. Ahn et al. 28 reported that complete CP (Veau II and greater) contributed to OME recurrence in patients with CP and that a significant difference was present between the single- and repeated-TT groups in the indwelling period of the first TT (12.7 \u00b1 9.6 and 10.5 \u00b1 6.5 months for the single- and repeated-TT groups, respectively). The authors also reported that there were significantly more male patients in the repeated-TT group than in the single-TT group 28. In contrast, our data did not show that sex was a risk factor for recurrence of OME (HR = 1.54 [0.70-3.89], p = 0.31). Considering that CP occurs more frequently in male than female patients 29, further\nanalyses are needed to elucidate the correlation between sex and the risk of recurrence of OME in children with CP."

Up to 90% to 96% of children with CP develop conductive hearing loss 30, 31. In comparison, children without CP have an approximately 12.9% prevalence of OME 32. Furthermore, OME causes primary acquired cholesteatoma in 0.9% to 5.9% of patients with CP. This rate represents a 100- to 200-fold higher probability of developing cholesteatoma in patients without CP. One of the reasons for simultaneous TT placement in children with CP should be prevention of sequelae affecting the tympanic membrane later in life, such as acquired cholesteatoma or adhesive otitis media.\nTT placement for OME in patients with CP is sometimes controversial. While there is a possibility\nof sequelae due to untreated OME, as mentioned above, TT placement might cause pathologic changes in the tympanic membrane such as calcification, persistent perforation (1.3%-19.0%), and adhesion and/or retraction (7.7%-36.8%) 24, 30. Moreover, one study showed that TT placement caused secondary acquired cholesteatoma in 1 (3.8%) of 26 patients 22. Dominguez and Harker 33 also reported that the risk of cholesteatoma in children with CP after myringotomy and/or TT placement was 2.6% (3 of 113 patients). In contrast, Gordon et al. 34 reported that the incidence of cholesteatoma was comparable between the TT insertion and non-TT insertion groups. In our study, there were no significant differences in the occurrence of major sequelae such as persistent perforation or adhesion and/or retraction of the tympanic membrane between the single-TT and repeated-TT groups during the observation period. These findings suggest that repeated TT placement is not a risk factor for major sequelae, further indicating that TT replacement can be recommended as an effective and safe treatment option if OME recurs. Even if the patient had a high risk of recurrence with a severe CP type and/or a short retention period of initial TT placement, no\npredictable factors have been reported whether OME will recur after subsequent TT placement. Therefore, repeated short-term TT insertions are recommended in order to keep the risk of sequelae low."
