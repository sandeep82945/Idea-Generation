As ELTHE\u2019s editor-in-chief, Kevin Dvorak, noted, we are all combing through an uncertain landscape. As such, it is important that we collect the testimonies of our peers, with hopes that their experiences will inform other experiential practitioners that find themselves in a similar position. The many voices and perspectives that you will find in this issue speak to the challenges of the last six months.\nThis first part of a two-part special issue includes five contributions from experiential educators across the disciplines. Joy Guarino shares her experience moving SUNY Buffalo State College\u2019s dance program fully online. R. Louis Hirsch and Aardra Kachroo describe transitioning an Agricultural and Medical Biotechnology (ABT) program online, providing important advice on how to salvage students\u2019 research experience despite lab closures. Kathy R. Doody, Pamela Schuetze, and Katrina Fulcher reflect on moving a collaborative and multidisciplinary service-learning project online, specifically changing assignments requiring in-person developmental screenings to online formats. Ryan Hargrove and Travis Klondike rethink face-to-face interactions in two institutional contexts, focusing on how instructors address a void in communal interaction and emotional connectedness. Finally, Elizabeth Lucas Combs and Aaron Kyle Schwartz discuss how they maintained innovative experiential learning for dietetic interns in Supervised Practice Programs (SPPs).\nWe are excited to share these articles with you and hope that they provide guidance and insight to\nothers as we collectively navigate the 2020-2021 academic year. n"

GUARINO SUNY Buffalo State College\nIntroduction Dance at SUNY Buffalo State College delivers a liberal arts education and embraces a civic and community engagement philosophy in all aspects of the program. In addition to rigorous studio training that enhances the physical experience of the art form, the diverse curriculum is designed to deepen students\u2019 understanding of the cultural, historical, and aesthetic value of dance, while addressing local and global societal needs through numerous service-learning, artistic, and outreach projects. The COVID-19 pandemic is tremendously affecting artists, yet it is the arts that brings joy to people\u2019s lives during unsettling times. Now more than ever we need to educate the broader public on the impact of dance on our lives.\nProgram Description Prior to COVID-19\nThe civic and community-engaged interdisciplinary dance program fulfills our dance students\u2019 distinct aspirations while enlightening the public on the important role of dance in our world. We continue to explore ways to incorporate high impact practices (HIPS) and applied learning pedagogy into course design and teaching practice to strengthen\nstudent learning. Contingent on the course, typical assignments include practicals, research papers, oral presentations, choreography, and lesson plan development. We intentionally extend the coursework beyond the classroom. Infusing concepts such as inclusion, mastery, and generosity into the teaching and learning process inspires students to want to share their hard work not only with their classmates but also with off-campus groups through community-engagement and service-learning projects.\nFor the Arts and Letters/Dance Interdisciplinary major, the culmination of a student\u2019s learning and vision of future endeavors is reflected in the capstone project; each project is as individual as the student and many include a community-engagement component. Whether it is a research study, resource guidebook, choreography, or other applied project, students are guided to produce a high-quality thesis that is presented in an open forum. Through community-engaged experiences, students become active citizens who reflect on the connection of dance to activism, education, culture, and aspects of daily life. Through the advocacy lens, there is an opportuni-\nFall 2020 54 ELTHE 3.1\ngoal changed to assembling the students\u2019 lessons to create guidebooks that introduced some background information on the benefits of dance and offered a series of lessons/activities specific to each community partner\u2019s population. The guidebooks were distributed to community partners so they can implement them in the future. Our students were excited to share their creations and look forward to continuing with our community partners in the future.\nThis year\u2019s annual spring dance concert, \u201cThe World Grooves: Dance Traditions and Explorations\u201d asked our alumni choreographers to embody traditions--their beliefs, ideals, and practices\u2014and accordingly invite the audience to examine their values and standards and to explore new ways for engagement and exchange. For prior concerts, our student-run Dance Association offered public workshops that introduced participants to aspects of the choreography, which subsequently made for a richer audience experience. We were not able to present \u201cThe World Grooves\u201d; however, students continued reviewing rehearsal videos and choreographers\u2019 notes to then reflect on performance skills and keep the works in our repertoire to perform at a later date. They also designed dance activities to prepare a future audience. COVID-19 may have changed the process but it didn\u2019t stop our students\u2019 passion for advancing dance education and engaging our community."

The program enrolls approximately 250 students and is administered around a liberal philosophy of interdisciplinarity, with undergraduates encouraged to build their own individualized curricula centered on foundational courses in biology, chemistry, and genetics. This student-centric approach, combined with an array of faculty research foci, results in a diverse student body engaging in scholarship that ranges from human neurobiology to plant rhizosphere metagenomics. A hallmark of the ABT program is a required capstone independent research experience, which is scaffolded after courses focused on identifying areas of research interests, formulating indepen dent research projects, understanding the scientific method in practice, and conducting hypothesis-driven research and presenting it in technical writing and oral formats. Since this independent research experience is predominantly laboratory-based, campus closures and social distancing requirements that occurred during the eighth week of the 16-week spring semester disrupted the pace of investigation and threatened the scholarship and, in some cases, graduation of many students. Despite interruptions to the research and academic enterprise, the faculty and students utilized several approaches to salvage their research experiences. These examples may offer strategies for similar programs to utilize as academia adapts to the institutional changes initiated in response to the COVID-19 pandemic."

Should we still not be able to come together to perform, students in dance composition will be asked to select a civically engaged theme. Throughout the semester, they will document their research, creative process, and movement experiences to create a solo work.
