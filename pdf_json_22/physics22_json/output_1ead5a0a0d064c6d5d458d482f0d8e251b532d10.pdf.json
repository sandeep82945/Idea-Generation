    "abstractText": "Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common intra-ocular tumor in Caucasian adults and may derive from melanocytes. Historically, the first therapeutic approach to treat UM has been surgical removal of the eye, with obvious consequences in terms of function, cosmesis, and psychological impact on patients. Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study (COMS) introduced the first uniform approach to perform interventional radiotherapy (IRT \u2013 brachytherapy) procedure in a standardized way that allowed to demonstrate equivalence of IRT with enucleation in terms of overall survival. Since this milestone, several international guidelines have been issued with regard to several technical aspects of this procedure, which has become the mainstream therapy worldwide. However, nowadays, there is still a lack of consensus about the criteria to definitively assess UM response after IRT. We present a collection of paradigmatic cases treated in our institution, and then discuss in detail the latest available evidence on the topic.

For the iris and ciliary body melanomas, in addition to tumor elevations and diameters, we routinely examined all 360\u00b0 of the anterior segment. Other high-frequency ultrasound characteristics were evaluated, including tumor shape, scleral invasion, inner vascularization, and internal tumor reflectivity. A comprehensive imaging of longitudinal and transversal ultrasound scans were reported for each clinical case at baseline and after treatment to illustrate ultrasound regression pattern.

            "text": "Case 1\nPatient number 1 was a 58-year-old male patient with a pigmented iris and ciliary body melanoma on the left\neye. On slit lamp physical examination, he presented dilated and tortuous episcleral blood vessels in the upper sector, and a nodular pigmented neo-formation placed between 10 and 1, occupying the iris stroma from the root, with an expansive growth in the anterior chamber to the corneal endothelium, as shown in gonioscopic image. Although the lesion involved the iridocorneal angle, the ocular tone was in the range of normal (15 mmHg).\nDuring ultrabiomicroscopic examination, it appeared as a ciliary body melanoma with iris extension; the hyperreflective iris pigment epithelium was partially eroded by tumor. Internal reflectivity was low. It extended from the pars plana to the intermediate portion of the iris, with infiltration of the iridocorneal angle up to the corneal endothelium. Posteriorly, it displaced the lens. Its\u2019 thickness was measured 5.4 mm, with the largest basal diameter of 13 mm. Based on these findings, a clinical diagnosis of the iris and ciliary body melanoma with anterior chamber invasion was made. The AJCC 8\u00b0 edition stage was T2bN0M0. The patient underwent IRT with 106Ru CCB plaque (prescribed dose 100 Gy) in 2017. At 1-year postIRT, the tumor showed partial remission; the pupil was irregular due to the presence of posterior synechiae. After 3 years, an ultrasound documented a remarkable re-\nJournal of Contemporary Brachytherapy (2022/volume 14/number 1)\nduction in tumor size, consisting in a flat area of iris pigmentation, and a ciliary body nodule with a thickness of 2.4 mm with increased acoustic reflectivity. The patient underwent cataract surgery; the best corrected visual acuity decreased from 20/25 at baseline to 20/63 at 1-year follow-up, and 20/200 at 3-year follow-up. The patient is still alive, with no evidence of recurrence.\nCase 2\nA 55-year-old male patient came to our attention with a history of excision of cutaneous melanoma. He had an iris nevus in his left eye that had changed over the last year. The best corrected visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes. Slit lamp examination revealed a nodular pigmented\nJournal of Contemporary Brachytherapy (2022/volume 14/number 1)\nmass of the iris, with irregularity of the pupillary foramen. At high resolution ultrasound biomicroscope, the tumor appeared as a hypoechoic thickening of the iris stroma with intact pigmented epithelium layer, measuring 1.95 mm in thickness and 5 mm in largest basal diameter.\nThe diagnosis was of iris melanoma, and IRT with 106Ru CCD (prescribed dose 100 Gy, dose to the sclera 260.4 Gy) was performed in 2018. No metastasis was found in a systemic work-up.\nOne year after the treatment, high-resolution ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) of the iris showed a partial regression with 1.24 mm thick. The patient is still alive, with no evidence of a recurrence.\nCase 3\nA 65-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with a chief complaint of visual field defect in her left eye. Her corrected visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes. Slit lamp examination showed a large darkly pigmented mass in the inferior quadrant. B scan and UBM examination were performed and revealed a tumor of choroidal origin extended from the root of the ciliary body to the equatorial portion of the bulb, with a domed appearance, a homogeneous acoustic structure, and a medium-low re-\nflectivity. It was associated with perilesional retinal lift with signs of neo-vascularization. The lesion had a thickness of 6 mm (A and B scan) and 10.7 mm of basal transversal diameter. Due to the ciliochoroidal location, B scan and UBM ultrasound examination were not a useful tool for measuring antero-posterior diameter. MRI measured a longitudinal diameter of 18 mm. The diagnosis was ciliochoroidal melanoma stage T3N0M0, and the patient underwent IRT with 125I plaque COMS 18 (prescribed dose 85 Gy) in 2013. Follow-up imaging was performed using both ultrasound and MRI, and showed a progressive regression of the tumor. The best corrected visual acuity at 3 years\u2019 follow-up was 20/32. The patient is still alive, with no evidence of a recurrence.\nCase 4\nA 77-year-old male patient was diagnosed with a choroidal melanoma during a routine eye examination. The tumor measured 3.84 mm in thickness and 16.6 mm in largest basal diameter (stage T3N0M0); it had a bilobed appearance and was located in the nasal quadrant in the juxtapapillary area. Baseline best corrected visual acuity was 20/20. A treatment plan for bilobed melanoma was arranged, and the patient underwent IRT with 106Ru\nJournal of Contemporary Brachytherapy (2022/volume 14/number 1)\nCCC plaque (prescribed dose 100 Gy, dose to the sclera 603.8 Gy) in 2018. Respectively, at one and three years from the treatment, the main dome had a thickness of 2.8 mm and 2.5 mm, and high internal reflectivity at B scan ultrasound examination. Minor dome showed a slower regression, and was treated with adjuvant transpupillary thermotherapy (TTT).\nThe patient developed radiation maculopathy and was treated with intravitreal injection; best corrected visual acuity after 3 years from the treatment was 20/400. The patient is still alive, with no evidence of a recurrence.\nCase 5\nA 42-year-old male underwent IRT with 106Ru CCD plaque (prescribed dose 100 Gy) in 2012 for a pigmented choroidal melanoma in his right eye located in the tempo-\nral quadrant. The pigmented choroidal melanoma measured 4.65 mm in height and 11.30 mm in largest basal diameter (stage T2N0M0). Baseline best corrected visual acuity was 20/20; after one year follow-up, the tumor had regressed to 2.6 mm, and visual acuity decreased to 20/32. 36 months after the treatment, visual acuity decreased to 20/100, and radiation maculopathy was diagnosed, treated with intravitreal injection and laser therapy. After 3 years from the treatment, the tumor thickness had regressed to 2.1 mm. The patient is still alive, with no evidence of a recurrence.\nCase 6\nA 44-year-old woman was referred to the Ocular Oncology Service because of a growth of an amelanotic choroidal nevus that for the 4 previous years had been stable.\nJournal of Contemporary Brachytherapy (2022/volume 14/number 1)\nThe patient had no significant past medical history; best corrected visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes. Ophthalmoscopy examination showed an amelanotic choroidal lesion with a pigmented base, a dome-shaped configuration and prominent intrinsic vessels, located in the inferotemporal hemisphere at the equator in her right eye.\nAt A-B scan ultrasonography, the tumor had a domeshaped choroidal morphology, low internal reflectivity, regular internal structure, internal blood flow (vascularity), associated serous retinal detachment, and measured 6.86 mm in height and 15 mm in largest basal diameter. No evidence of metastatic lesions was present (stage T3N0M0). The patient was treated with COMS\n18 125I plaque (prescribed dose 85 Gy, dose to the sclera 274.1 Gy) in 2018. After 1-year follow-up, the tumor had regressed to 4 mm in thickness, and after 3 years to 2.2 mm. Visual acuity was 20/20 at baseline, 20/25 at 1-year follow-up, and decreased to 20/200 at three years because of radiation maculopathy development. The patient is still alive, with no evidence of a recurrence.\nCase 7\nA 75-year-old man was referred to our Ocular Oncology Service following a chance discovery of a pigmented lesion in his right eye. Best corrected visual acuity was\nJournal of Contemporary Brachytherapy (2022/volume 14/number 1)\n20/32 in both eyes. On ophthalmoscopic examination, he presented a deeply pigmented, mushroom-shaped choroidal lesion, located temporal to the macula in the right eye, with a breakthrough Bruch\u2019s membrane, retinal detachment, and localized vitreous hemorrhage. At B-scan ultrasonography, the lesion showed low internal reflectivity, and measured 6.2 mm in height and 9.8 mm in largest basal diameter; it was associated with signs of internal vascularization and serous retinal detachment. There was no evidence of any other primary/metastatic lesions on systemic evaluation. The stage was T2N0M0.\nThe patient was treated with COMS18 125I plaque (prescribed dose 85 Gy) in 2011. At one-year follow-up, choroidal melanoma had remained regressed at 3.7 mm thickness, and at a three-year follow-up, the tumor had regressed to 2.9 mm in thickness and presented increased reflectivity at ultrasound examination. At that time, best corrected visual acuity had decreased to 20/200 in the affected eye, secondary to the development of radiation maculopathy. Systemic evaluation showed no evidence of systemic metastases. The patient is still alive, with no evidence of a recurrence.\nCase 8\nA 75-year-old woman came for observation because of an appearance of a pigmented lesion in her right eye. External examination OD revealed nasally at 3 o\u2019clock, two pigmented episcleral masses, measuring 2 mm in basal diameter and 1 mm in thickness, associated with dilated and tortuous episcleral vessels. Slit lamp biomicroscopy and gonioscopy OD revealed a pigmented nodule of the iris. Ultrasound biomicroscopic image through the ciliary body region OD confirmed the presence of a thin epibulbar ipoecogenic tissue mass corresponding to extrascleral tumor extension. The ciliary body tumor measured 4.30 mm in thickness, 11.45 mm in transversal diameter, and 8 mm in longitudinal diameter, and extended anteriorly with infiltration of the iris and the angle. The diagnosis was primary uveal melanoma of the ciliary body with iris infiltration and nodular extrascleral extension. The stage was T2dN0M0.\nThe treatment consisted of IRT with CCD 106Ru (prescribed dose 100 Gy) in 2009. On subsequent 1-year follow-up examination, there was a complete disappearance of the iris and episcleral nodule, and a partial remission\nJournal of Contemporary Brachytherapy (2022/volume 14/number 1)\nof the ciliary body tumor to the thickness of 2.9 mm. At 3 years follow-up, the ciliary body tumor had regressed to 2.5 mm in thickness, and presented increased reflectivity at ultrasound examination. Best corrected visual acuity was stable to 20/25. The patient is still alive, with no evidence of a recurrence."

            "text": "Following IRT, it is widely known that some UMs respond faster than others [10]. US assessment is the main and most commonly used diagnostic strategy to monitor UM regression; however, in the recent years, some authors have started to use MRI in addition to monitor UM response to IRT [11]. Early studies highlighted that regression of tumors rarely results in a flat and depigmented scar [12].\nThe first attempts to study UM responses emphasized that possible outcomes following IRT may be categorized into four main patterns according to changes in UM height: type D (decrease), type S (stable), type I (increase), and type M (miscellaneous). Noticeably, the most heterogeneous category (type M) includes clinical situations,\nin which in some cases, the response remains stationary after an initial shrinking (maximum shrinkage reported: 8 mm in 29 months) and then, after some time, may start shrinking again (second regression may start at 8 to 60 months after IRT, and the magnitude of the shrinkage may be in some cases dramatic) [13].\nMore recently, other authors confirmed that regression patterns might actually be divided into 4 different outcomes, such as \u2018decrease\u2019, \u2018stable\u2019, \u2018increase\u2019, and \u2018other\u2019. The \u2018decrease\u2019 pattern was found to be the most common occurring in 43% of all cases. Interestingly, the second most common outcome was \u2018other\u2019 accounting for almost 40%, and authors have proposed some sub-categories, such as \u2018decrease-stable\u2019 (16%) and \u2018zigzag\u2019 (10%). Remarkably, authors report that regression pattern of the thickness is slower when compared to regression pattern of the area; additionally, regression patterns of the thickness versus the area may even be discordant in up to 1/3 of cases. Another extremely interesting finding emerged considering tumors with an unbroken, indeterminate, and broken Bruch\u2019s membrane; in fact, increasing proportions regressed according to the \u2018decrease\u2019 pattern [14].\nJournal of Contemporary Brachytherapy (2022/volume 14/number 1)\nOther researchers, who have similarly focused on regression patterns, have highlighted that tumor regression rate raises with increasing tumor height and slows down with increasing of largest basal diameter [15].\nFocusing on time, some authors have demonstrated that usually the largest decrease of tumor size is expected to occur within 12 months after IRT [16]. However, a proper follow-up period to definitively assess the response should be extended up to 3 years according to other experiences [17]. Several researchers have even proposed an early time cut-off of 6 months to identify possible insufficient tumor regression or tumor progression [18].\nMore in detail, the speed of decrease of UM height after IRT starts with an initial rate of approximately 3% per month. Most of the tumors do not regress entirely; rather, their height stabilizes with a constant value (on average 61% of the initial height) after approximately 18 to 24 months [19]. Initial tumor regression rate has been associated in some studies with a prognostic value, and faster regression rates tend to be associated with higher incidence of metastases [20].\nSuch association has not been confirmed in other series, where a regression rate at 6 months was sub-divided into three different patterns, including \u2018slow\u2019 = 0.02 mm per month, \u2018medium\u2019 = 0.32 mm per month, and \u2018fast\u2019 = 0.67 mm per month. In this series, no association metastatic rate and response rate in medium-sized UM were observed [21].\nSeveral authors have shown that thicker uveal melanomas present a steeper and more pronounced reduction in terms of thickness following IRT. In particular, after first phase, the regression curve becomes similar for tumors with different thicknesses [22].\nMore recently, other researchers have identified a different model of tumor response, which can be modeled by a negative exponential function for the first 7 years after treatment, depending on initial height, except for those less than 2.5 mm [23].\nA recent systematic review and meta-analysis highlighted that the efficacy of 106Ru in controlling uveal melanomas decreases with an increase in tumor thickness [24].\nWhen comparing different radiotherapy techniques, among them, there is evidence in literature that IRT results in a faster tumor regression compared to stereotactic radiotherapy (gamma knife or linear accelerator) [25]. There is additional evidence supporting that IRT allows to obtain a faster response compared to proton beam therapy [26].\nOcular IRT utilization in clinical practice should be encouraged because available data support its\u2019 use both in terms of efficacy and safety. The possible causes for its\u2019 underuse across different centers have been a matter of debate, and several reasons have been highlighted, including specific areas of interest in the field of national guidelines, education, research, and communication with patients and colleagues of other specialties [27].\nThere are also other parameters, which should be taken into account when evaluating UM response, including decreased intrinsic tumor vascularity, decreased tumor-related sub-retinal fluid, increased pigmentation,\nspecific changes in orange pigment lipofuscin, resolution of drusenoid retinal pigment in epithelial detachments, and increase in internal reflectivity on ultrasound. These parameters are especially important for situations, when a single-measure change in measured thickness does not comprehensively describe findings associated with regression, such as the case of iris melanomas [28, 29].\nAnother point of paramount relevance is the use of intra-operative ocular ultrasonography to verify the correct position of the plaques in patients treated uveal melanoma [30].\nWhen it comes to considering the relationship between tumor response and genes, there are contradictory experiences in the literature [31, 32]. In fact, some researchers have pointed out that there is no distinct association between gene class type in UM after IRT at 3 and 6 months, when considering baseline tumor height [33]. However, other authors have found that class 1 UM tumors tend to regress more rapidly than class 2 tumors in the first 6 months after IRT [34]. Various investigators have even identified a distinct subset of class 1 UM (3%) that experience a very rapid tumor regression associated with transient tumor inflammation and uveitis underlying an immune-modulated mechanism [35]."
