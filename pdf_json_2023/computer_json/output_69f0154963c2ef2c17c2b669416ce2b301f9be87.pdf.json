    "abstractText": "There is an emergent need to examine teachers\u2019 acceptance of distance education through LMS during emergencies to leverage online teaching and learning to enhance teachers\u2019 future readiness for digital transformation in education. This study explores Saudi teachers\u2019 perceptions of Madrasati (national e-learning system). It investigates its ease of use, usefulness, behavioural intention to use the system, and its actual use in association with external factors from teachers\u2019 perspective to identify the platform\u2019s most supportive elements during remote online teaching due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings from 197 participants show that teachers positively perceived Madrasati regarding the system\u2019s external variables, including content quality, teaching support, visual design, system navigation features, ease of access, system interactivity, and instructional assessment tools, and they positively perceived the system\u2019s learnability.

This study explores Saudi teachers\u2019 perceptions of Madrasati (national e-learning system). It investigates its ease of use, usefulness, behavioural intention to use the system, and its actual use in association with external factors from teachers\u2019 perspective to identify the platform\u2019s most supportive elements during remote online teaching due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings from 197 participants show that teachers positively perceived Madrasati regarding the system\u2019s external variables, including content quality, teaching support, visual design, system navigation features, ease of access, system interactivity, and instructional assessment tools, and they positively perceived the system\u2019s learnability."

            "text": "The outbreak of COVID-19 has had an unprecedented impact on education systems worldwide. There have been varied international responses to this public health crisis, mostly reactionary. According to a report by UNESCO (2020), the COVID-19 Pandemic has entailed the most extensive disruption to the education system in history, affecting 94% of the world\u2019s student population in more than 190 countries.\nGiven the rapidly evolving nature of the outbreak, governments must adapt their countries\u2019 responses continually and with little to no clarity on the duration for which the restrictions must be imposed. School closures since February 2020 due to Coronavirus (COVID-19) have affected students, teachers, and working parents. According to UNESCO (2020), more than 100 countries\nhave implemented nationwide closures, negatively impacting more than half of the world\u2019s student population and their educational attainment. The closure resulted in an immediate and rapid transition to distance-learning solutions across most educational institutions all around the globe. Consequently, it is essential for school systems to quickly implement remote teaching and learning, which caused significant changes in the conventional instructional practices leading to the transition from traditional face-to-face learning to online learning from home.\nOne of the highly autonomous instructional contexts afforded to students and teachers during the Pandemic is Emergency Remote Teaching (ERT) (Hodges, Moore, Lockee, Trust & Bond, 2020), a temporary shift of instructional delivery to an alternate delivery model because of the COVID-19 crisis. In contrast to the learning experiences initially planned to be online, ERT involves using fully remote teaching solutions for instruction that would otherwise be delivered face-to-face or as blended or hybrid courses and is likely to switch over to the face-to-face format once the crisis or emergency has ended. The primary objective is to provide temporary access to instruction and instructional supports that can be quickly implemented and readily available during an emergency or crisis.\nThe shift to ERT requires that faculty to be more engaged in the course design, development, and implementation processes and that students learn independently, can manage learning resources, and strategize the learning process. The Pandemic\u2019s abrupt spread forced institutions to switch to distance education or postpone education indefinitely (Khanfar, 2020). In response to the sudden global health conditions, MOE in Saudi Arabia launched a virtual E-school platform called \u201cMadrasati,\u201d or \u201cMy School\u201d in Arabic, with a business model that highly simulates the in-person school model and provides teachers and students with a learning experience relatively comparable to the face-to-face experience."

            "text": "Teaching through Learning Management Systems (LMS) during the COVID-19 pandemic offered educators various experiences. Factors such as familiarity with digital platforms, the availability of resources, and institutional support greatly influenced these experiences (Trust & Whalen, 2020). A common issue was the challenge of the sudden transition from in-person to online instruction. For many educators, especially those with limited exposure to digital teaching tools and the need to quickly grasp the multifaceted functionalities of LMS platforms posed a significant challenge (Bozkurt et al., 2020). Mastering LMS was challenging for many educators, as these platforms incorporate many features, from discussion forums and grading tools to live video conferencing capabilities (Bozkurt et al., 2020).\nOnline assessment posed another significant challenge, with educators grappling with the intricacies of evaluating student progress, maintaining academic integrity, and providing constructive feedback within a virtual setting (Crawford et al., 2020). Teachers also faced the challenge of balancing synchronous and asynchronous learning modes, each with advantages and drawbacks (Hodges et al., 2020). In addition, teachers needed to adapt their curriculum to digital formats. This adaptation required restructuring lessons to maintain student engagement, creating new assignments and assessments suited to online learning, and developing proficiency with digital tools and resources (Hodges et al., 2020). This workload and time management surfaced as notable concerns. Teachers reported an increased workload due to the need to adapt lesson plans for online instruction, develop new digital materials, and manage online assessments. Blurring boundaries between personal and professional life also led to feelings of being constantly on duty (Crawford et al., 2020).\nMaintaining student engagement and participation in a virtual setting emerged as another significant challenge. With absent physical cues, teachers had to develop innovative methods to ensure interactive lessons and gauge student comprehension (Bao, 2020). While LMS platforms facilitate communication and collaboration, many teachers need help leveraging these tools effectively to\nengage with students and parents and foster student collaboration (Johnson et al., 2020). In an online learning environment, fostering a sense of community and connection among students often proves more challenging, requiring innovative approaches to foster class cohesion and facilitate peer-to-peer interactions (Bao, 2020). Yet, creative solutions have emerged to build class cohesion and encourage peer interactions (Boling et al., 2020).\nTechnological issues further complicated this challenge. Teachers and students faced connectivity problems, a lack of suitable devices, and varied levels of technical proficiency, leading to disruptions in teaching and learning (Hodges et al., 2020). Beyond the teaching realm, educators provided technical support to students and parents, an unfamiliar extension of their usual responsibilities (Trust & Whalen, 2020). Further, the pandemic underscored the stark digital divide in access to education. Not all students had equal access to stable internet or appropriate devices, significantly impacting their ability to participate in online learning (Hodges et al., 2020). Alongside these professional hurdles, the isolation and overall stress induced by the pandemic exerted an emotional toll on teachers, who had to devise strategies to manage their stress levels and maintain their mental well-being (Rapanta et al., 2020, Jandri\u0107 et al., 2020). An interesting observation was that students, out of necessity, improved their digital literacy skills, becoming proficient with various digital tools and online discussions (Hrastinski, 2019). Therefore, school administrators\u2019 support and clear communication became crucial, significantly influencing the teachers\u2019 experiences (Johnson et al., 2020) and providing much-needed support and clear communication to teachers (Bao, 2020).\nNevertheless, the transition also brought about positive experiences and innovations. Customization of learning to cater to individual student needs to be became more feasible in an online setup, a flexibility that traditional classrooms often needed to improve. Moreover, teachers broadened their skill sets, discovering new resources, improving technological proficiency, and acquiring innovative pedagogical strategies (Hodges et al., 2020).\nFurther, the professional development and support received by teachers played a crucial role in shaping their experiences. Teachers who received adequate training in LMS and digital teaching methods generally reported a more positive experience (Jandri\u0107 et al., 2020). Many teachers reported professional growth as they gained new skills, became more comfortable with technology, and discovered new teaching methods (Trust & Whalen, 2020).\nIncreased parental involvement emerged as a significant trend in this online shift. While this added layer of engagement posed challenges, it also improved partnerships between teachers and parents, fostering a collaborative effort in student learning (Garbe et al., 2020). While it occasionally led to increased pressure, it also facilitated stronger partnerships between teachers and parents in supporting student learning (Bolstad et al., 2021).\nThe pandemic necessitated a significant shift in education, forcing educators to innovate and rethink traditional methods. Indeed, the experiences and lessons gleaned from this transition to online teaching via LMS during the COVID-19 crisis will likely influence educational practices in the postpandemic era (Jandri\u0107 et al., 2020). Previous research has examined teachers\u2019 readiness for change and acceptance of technology. However, few studies have addressed the acceptance of technology by teachers in the context of emergency teaching during a pandemic or with handling technologyassisted teaching and the use of newly introduced\nLMS for everyday distance teaching practices (Dindar et al., 2021)."

            "text": "In the pivotal shift from traditional classroom education to distance learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, the preparedness of teachers to implement distance education plans is considered a key factor for success. Adapting to online teaching presented substantial challenges for educators, such as maintaining effective communication with students and facilitating their learning. The acceptance of technology by teachers can help overcome resistance to change, boost motivation, and contribute to positive long-term results (Kimmons, R., 2015). Educational institutions worldwide have seen a\nparadigm shift from traditional classroom teaching to online teaching and learning, fueled mainly by the COVID-19 pandemic (Toquero, 2020) due to the abrupt schools\u2019 closure. Technology plays a crucial role in facilitating this transition. However, teachers\u2019 preparedness and acceptance of technology serve as critical factors in implementing successful online teaching (Trust & Whalen, 2020).\nFew studies have addressed the acceptance of technology by teachers in the context of emergency teaching during a pandemic or with handling technology-assisted teaching and the use of newly introduced Learning Management Systems (LMS) for everyday distance teaching practices (Dindar, Suorsa, Hermes, Karppinen, N\u00e4ykki, 2021). Empirical studies investigating teachers\u2019 acceptance of technology during the abrupt switch from traditional to fully remote learning, with technology integration, are still in their early stages. Therefore, there is a pressing need to study teachers\u2019 acceptance of distance education via LMS, to optimize the online teaching and learning processes, resources, and tools, and to prepare teachers for future digital transformation in education (Al-Fraihat, Joy, & Sinclair, 2020; Park, 2009; Sun, Tsai, Finger, Chen, & Yeh, 2008). One area that merits more focus is understanding how teachers cope with newly implemented LMS in their online teaching practices (Trust, Krutka, & Carpenter, 2020). While empirical studies have begun to investigate this area, there is a need for more research in this domain (K\u00f6nig, J\u00e4ger-Biela, & Glutsch, 2020). This knowledge can help maximize the utility of online teaching and learning resources and better equip teachers for future digital transformations in education (Rasmitadila et al., 2020)."

            "heading": "Technology Acceptance Model",
            "text": "The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) has been widely used as the theoretical basis for many empirical studies on user technology acceptance and can help predict end-user acceptance of an e-learning system in an organization (Davis, Bagozzi, & Warshaw, 1989). The TAM can be developed based on its application to any specific domain of human-computer interactions (Davis, Bagozzi & Warshaw, 1989). It was employed to explore the acceptance of Information Technology (IT) use. According to TAM, individual user intention and behaviour are affected by two key variables: perceived ease of use and usefulness (Figure 1).\nDavis (1989) developed the TAM to predict the factors affecting IT use, based on the Theory of Reasoned Action by Fishbein and Ajzen (Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975) and the Theory of Planned Behavior by Ajzen (Ajzen, 1991), in which the TAM was extended and developed based on the two components: perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. The former referred to the ease of use of IT subjectively perceived by users based on the notion that the easier the use is perceived to be, the higher the level of acceptance of IT. The latter refers to the extent of use of IT subjectively perceived by the users. Perceived usefulness is defined as the \u201cdegree to which an individual believes that a particular system would enhance job performance\u201d (Davis, 1989, p. 320). Perceived ease of use is the \u201cdegree to which an individual believes that using a particular system would be free of effort\u201d(Davis, Bagozzi & Warshaw, 1989, p. 320). The TAM has been widely used to predict and explain user behaviour towards information technology. The model proposes that perceived ease of use and usefulness influence users\u2019 technology acceptance (Davis, 1989).\nTAM questionnaires have been subjected to factor analysis to determine the content and construct validity of the usefulness and ease of use sub-scales and have demonstrated acceptable results (King & He, 2006). TAM has been used across various studies to measure technology diffusion through acceptance of new technology and has revealed a strong relationship between the key constructs of perceived usefulness, behavioural intention, and effects on learning performance (Al-Aulamie, 2013).\nPerceived ease of use is a fundamental construct in the TAM (Davis, 1989) that has been highlighted by multiple technology-acceptance theories, such as the TAM (Davis,1989); A-TAM (Taylor & Todd, 1995); TAM2 (Venkatesh & Davis, 2000); and TAM3 (Venkatesh & Bala, 2008). Ease of use was theorized as a factor that likely increased the likelihood of using the system (Abdullah et al., 2016; Yoon, 2016) and conceptualized as an antecedent to perceived usefulness and behavioural intention to use the system. Perceived usefulness is a critical construct in the TAM (Davis, 1989).\nIn the context of LMS, Jong (2009) found that the relationship between behavioural intention and actual use is the strongest of the relationships in his model. There is a significant relationship between behavioural intention and actual use based on the TAM (Alenezi, 2012; Alenezi et al., 2011), and the actual use of LMS is positively influenced by behavioural intention to use the system (Baleghi-Zadeh et al., 2017; Mohammadi, 2015; Tarhini, 2013). However, some researchers have argued for including additional factors in the model, such as social influence, to more accurately reflect the complexity of teachers\u2019 technology acceptance (Dwivedi et al., 2019). Indeed, expanding the TAM could help better understand and promote technology adoption in education in the future.\nZaharias and Poylymenakou (2009) proposed eight usability attributes as external variables that could affect perceived usefulness and ease of use that have been discussed and added to the revised TAM model (Binyamin, Rutter &Smith 2019). These attributes include content quality, teaching support, visual design, system navigation, ease of access, system interactivity, instructional assessment, and system learnability. The rationale behind their inclusion is to identify critical factors affecting perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness to predict acceptance, such as system features and design that can potentially enhance the explanatory power of TAM and improve the explained variance of constructs (Abdullah & Ward, 2016; Davies, 1989; Nikou & Economides, 2017). The first factor, \u2018content quality\u2019, refers to the e-learning system\u2019s quality of information, accuracy, content sufficiency, and organization (Al-Ammari & Hamad, 2008; Junus et al., 2015; Zaharias, 2009). The second factor is the \u2018teaching support\u2019 needed in the learning environment, such as providing guiding documents and high-quality communication tools (Binyamin, Rutter &Smith, 2019; Zaharias & Poylymenakou, 2009). The third is the \u2018visual design\u2019 of the LMS, which refers to the user interface and layout design that can affect perceptions of system usefulness and ease of use (Al-Aulamie, 2013; Khedr et al., 2012). An appealing visual design supports comprehension, reduces cognitive load, and enhances users\u2019 satisfaction and positive attitude regarding e-learning (S\u00e1nchez-Franco et al., 2013; Scholtz et al., 2016). System navigation is another essential element in designing e-learning systems, referring to the system\u2019s learning curve and understandability. System navigation is essential for LMS effectiveness and positively influences system usability and ease of use (Khan & Qutab, 2016).\nEase of access refers to the degree of flexibility and ease of access to the system features, functions, content, and services without difficulty starting from the log-in process to the course content (Park, 2009). Ease of access is considered a critical success factor for e-learning systems (Alhabeeb & Rowley, 2018; Salloum, 2018; Tran, 2016). System interactivity is another crucial factor in the success of e-learning systems. It reflects students\u2019 engagement with the system and learning by interacting with their peers, teachers, and the content (Junus et al., 2015). System interactivity positively affects users\u2019 perceptions of system usability, ease of use (Althobaiti & Mayhew, 2016; Junus et al., 2015), students\u2019 intention to use the system and their success in learning. Instructional assessment is another critical component of effective LMS that can provide indicators of students\u2019 performance and feedback for instructors after formative and summative feedback on students\u2019 attainment of learning outcomes, ultimately improving their academic achievement (Uribe, 2014; Wang, 2014). Instructional assessment tools positively impact users\u2019 perceptions of the system\u2019s usability and ease of use (Binyamin, Rutter &Smith 2019). System learnability is a crucial aspect of the effectiveness of LMS that indicates the capability of an e-learning system to support users in using the system and interacting with it effectively. System learnability reflects the system\u2019s potential to provide easy learnable system features through integrated tutorials, orientation, supportive chatbots, and system messages to lessen the system\u2019s potential learning curve (Jabar et al., 2013). Therefore, system learnability positively impacts the system\u2019s perceived ease of use (Aziz & Kamaludin, 2014).\nIn education, numerous studies have confirmed the TAM model\u2019s validity in predicting teachers\u2019 acceptance and use of technology. For example, Teo (2011) study found that perceived ease of use and usefulness were significant predictors of teachers\u2019 intentions to use technology.\nWith the rise of distance learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, the TAM has been used to examine educators\u2019 adoption of digital tools. Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m and Dursun (2020) applied the TAM to\ninvestigate teachers\u2019 acceptance of cloud-based digital platforms. Their findings indicated that perceived usefulness, ease of use, and attitude towards use significantly affected the behavioural intention to use these platforms."

The first section has four questions regarding the demographic characteristics of the participants: gender, academic degree, specialization, and teaching experience. This section aimed to ensure that teachers from different backgrounds were included in this study. The following section included a revised TAM survey with two key groups of constructs (Binyamin, Rutter &Smith, 2019). The first subsection consists of eight usability constructs with 34 positive statements. The second subsection consists of the original TAM survey instrument, consisting of four constructs with 17 positive statements, four items for perceived ease of use, five for perceived usefulness, four for intention to use, and four for actual use. Following the previous literature regarding e-learning acceptance (Alkhalaf, 2013; Almarashdeh & Alsmadi, 2016; Ghazal et al., 2018; Kanwal & Rehman, 2017; Khedr et al., 2012; Majdalawi et al., 2014), the statements were scored on a five-point Likert scale.\nFor each statement, the participants were asked to select the answer that best represented their level of agreement on a five-point Likert scale in which 1 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree as a useful measure of the attitude and perceptions of respondents (Sue & Ritter, 2012). According to Davies (1998), these usability constructs have high reliability and validity for measuring the intended constructs and are widely adopted in measuring usability and technology acceptance.\nThe instrument used in this study, TAM attributes in Madrasati, was subjected to rigorous reliability and validity testing. The tool\u2019s validity was evaluated by a panel of seven field experts consisting of three e-learning specialists, two teachers, a supervisor, and an educational administrator. They reviewed and examined the instrument for content and construct validity, ensuring that it accurately measures what it intends to measure and appropriately represents the construct under study. The instrument\u2019s reliability was established using Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient, which yielded a high value of 0.957, suggesting strong internal consistency among the items in the instrument. The instrument is multi-sectional, with the fourth section containing two open-ended questions that aim to gather teacher perspectives on critical support available and challenges encountered in using Madrasati. The responses to these open-ended questions were analyzed qualitatively to provide nuanced insights into the research topic.

For each indicator, the respondents were asked to select the answer that best represented their level of agreement based on a five-point Likert scale (See Table 2).\nThe results show that the mean values of the constructs ranged between 4.20 (0.857) and 3.76 (1.031), which indicated that most respondents in this study had a positive attitude toward Madrasati\u2019s content quality, teaching support, visual design, system navigation, ease of access, system interactivity, instructional assessment, and system learnability. This result is consistent with prior research on\nSaudi LMS (Al-Aulamie, 2013; Alenezi, 2011; Alshorman & Bawaneh, 2018). Furthermore, all indicators had small standard deviations (SD), implying that the scores on the responses were all close to the mean value.\n2. What are teachers\u2019 perceptions of the usability and ease of use attributes of the Madrasati Platform?\nThe descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation) were calculated to answer this question. For each indicator, the respondents were asked to select the answer that best represented their agreement level based on a five-point Likert scale (Table 3).\nThe results show that the mean values of the constructs and the standard deviation of Madrasati\u2019s perceived ease of use ranged between 4.20 (0.857) and 3.92 (0.955), which indicates that most respondents in this study believed that Madrasati was easy to use. The results are consistent with prior research on the use of LMS in Saudi Arabia (Al-Aulamie, 2013; Alenezi, 2011; Alshorman & Bawaneh, 2018). Furthermore, all indicators maintain small SD values, implying that the responses are close to the mean. The results show that the M values of the constructs of Madrasati\u2019s perceived usefulness ranged between 4.18 (0.871) and 3.46 (1.412), which indicates that most respondents in this study considered Madrasati useful. Further, the highest mean for behavioural intention to use Madrsati is 4.21 (0.810), and the lowest is 3.56 (1.295). For actual use of Madrsati, the mean values ranged from 4.23 (0.780) to 3.44 (1.196), which shows that participants intend to use Madrasati and are using it regularly.\n3.

            "text": "Participants discussed the potential downsides and challenges of using Madrasati in distance education. Of the participants, 22 teachers said they faced technical challenges such as interrupted Internet connections. One teacher mentioned, \u201cOne of the biggest challenges I faced teaching through Madrasati during COVID was the digital divide. Not all students had equal access to technology or reliable internet, which made it difficult for some to fully engage during the class\u201d.\nIn addition, 11 mentioned technical difficulties, and eight expressed problems communicating with some students \u201cDealing with technical issues was a persistent challenge. There were times when Madrasati was down or certain features weren\u2019t working as they should, disrupting the learning process\u201d. In addition, five teachers shared that there is a need to include more videos or interactive content in some lessons. Seven teachers shared that they addressed the challenge of managing classes and lessons for elementary school students and following up with less active students. One teacher mentioned, \u201cIt was difficult to monitor student engagement through an Madrasati. You can\u2019t see if a\nstudent is paying attention, and sometimes it\u2019s hard to know if they\u2019re truly understanding the material\u201d. Additionally, 13 teachers noted that some students did not readily accept or were not highly motivated to use the platform, faced difficulty in interaction, and needed to be more committed. One teacher mentioned, \u201cIt was difficult to monitor student engagement through Madrasati. You can\u2019t see if a student is paying attention, and sometimes it\u2019s hard to know if they understand the material\u201d. Seven teachers also expressed concern that some students depended entirely on their parents and needed more self-regulated learning skills and that some parents needed to take online learning seriously. Nine teachers expressed that they could not fully know their students well enough and could not conduct an effective follow-up on their progress or address their learning difficulties during their online lessons. One teacher mentioned, \u201cDespite the plethora of communication tools in Madrasati, nothing can truly replace face-to-face interaction. Building relationships and understanding students\u2019 non-verbal cues became more challenging\u201d."

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "The findings show that teachers positively perceived Madrasati regarding the system\u2019s external variables, including the content quality, teaching support, visual design, system navigation features, ease of access, system interactivity, instructional assessment tools, and they also positively perceived the system\u2019s learnability with a total mean of 3.43 for external variables. Further, teachers agreed that their experience with Madrasati was positive, as they could access the platform easily. They perceived it as a useful LMS, agreed that they had already used the system in their teaching, and expressed their intention to use it in the future.\nThe findings highlight that Madrasati has rich content that satisfies teachers\u2019 needs, and the finding conforms to the results of previous studies (Salloum, 2018), which highlights that content quality enhances the perceptions of the ease of use of e-learning systems. Moreover, content quality supports individuals\u2019 perception of the system\u2019s usefulness and, therefore, its usage and future implementation in teachers\u2019 practice, which aligns with the previous findings (Al-Aulamie, 2013; Binyamin, Rutter &Smith, 2019; Ghazal et al., 2018).\nRegarding instructional support, teachers need to be provided with different levels and types of support in using LMS to make their teaching effective and facilitate the implementation of the best teaching strategies through well-planned professional development programs and various capacitybuilding programs. This study shows that the teachers perceived the importance of instructional support positively, corroborating previous findings (Bao, 2020, Binyamin, Rutter &Smith, 2019, Johnson et al., 2020). Hence, they positively perceived its ease of use and its usefulness. In addition, teachers are more likely to perceive the e-learning system as helpful if they find the most efficient tools to support their day-to-day teaching practices, such as content, lesson plans, communication tools, activities, and assessments sustained by professional development practices.\nThe visual design was perceived positively by teachers, which enhances the perceptions of the ease of use of e-learning systems in conformity with the findings of previous research (Al-Aulamie, 2013; Khedr et al., 2012). According to Cyr et al. (2006), visual design has a significant positive impact on the constructs of TAM and creates an enjoyable user experience. However, although Binyamin, Rutter & Smith (2019) did not find a relationship between visual design and perceived ease of use, some studies found a direct positive influence on the perceived usefulness of the system (Khedr et al., 2012). Further, this study revealed that teachers find Madrasati as an organized LMS with a convenient navigation structure. Teachers prefer systems where information can be found easily and links can be followed and navigated throughout the system and course elements to mitigate the technology usage learning curve (Johnson et al., 2020, Khan & Qutab, 2016; Theng & Sin, 2012). Therefore, according to Binyamin, Rutter &Smith (2019), this factor supports ease of use and system usefulness.\nThe results show that teachers find Madrsati easy to access, which directly impacts the perceived ease of use of the e-learning systems without direct impact on the perception of the system\u2019s usefulness\n(Binyamin, Rutter, & Smith, 2019; Parsazadeh et al., 2017). However, teachers\u2019 perception of ease of use had the least mean value (3.44), which could be attributed to technical and internet issues they faced during distance teaching using Madrasati. This is consistent with previous studies highlighting how teachers and students faced connectivity problems, a lack of suitable devices, and varied levels of technical proficiency, leading to disruptions in teaching and learning (Hodges et al., 2020, Trust & Whalen, 2020). In addition, teachers perceived Madrsati as an interactive LMS with effective communication tools. Research shows that system interactivity supports the perception of the ease of use and usefulness of the system, and the finding of this study is consistent with previous findings on e-learning (Jandri\u0107 et al., 2020, Johnson et al., 2020, Parsazadeh et al., 2017; Theng & Sin, 2012).\nTeachers agreed that Madrasati employs useful instructional assessment tools, directly influencing the perceived ease of use (Binyamin, Rutter & Smith 2019). According to Binyamin, Rutter &Smith (2019), system learnability has the strongest significant relationship with perceived ease of use of all external variables, and this could be attributed to the extensive professional development programs used for training teachers on how to use the system during school closure time due to the Pandemic, and due to the instructional and training materials provided to the teachers to enhance their knowledge, skills, and competency in how to teach online and use Madrsati portal through the Back to School portal. These materials were provided through easy-to-access links and video guides on the same portal associated with the log-in page. This finding is well-aligned with several empirical studies on information systems (Aziz & Kamaludin, 2014, Boling et al., 2020, Jandri\u0107 et al., 2020, Johnson et al., 2020,). Moreover, the systems\u2019 learnability supports the positive perception of system usefulness (Boling et al., 2020, Aziz & Kamaludin, 2014; Scholtz et al., 2016). Teachers perceived Madrasati as easy to use, which has been discussed as a significant indicator of the system\u2019s usefulness.\nMadrasati can be accessed without time or effort and used for multiple teaching and learning purposes. The system features and services are provided through easy to navigate structure provided in the native language (Hakami, 2018). The finding is consistent with technology models, such as the TAM (Davis et al., 1989); the A-TAM (Taylor & Todd, 1995), the TAM2 (Venkatesh & Davis, 2000); the model of perceived ease of use determinants (Venkatesh, 2000), and the TAM3 (Venkatesh & Bala, 2008), as well as studies in e-learning in Saudi Arabia (Alenezi, 2012; Al-Gahtani, 2016). Furthermore, it was assumed that behavioural intention to use LMS is directly affected by the perceived ease of use of LMS (Abdullah et al., 2016). This highlights that a system should be easy to use and that this is a factor on which the adoption of an LMS is likely to depend.\nTeachers perceived Madrsati as a useful LMS that has a positive effect on an individual\u2019s behavioural intention to use the platform, and this relationship is the strongest among the direct relationships between system usefulness and TAM variables (Al-Gahtani, 2016; Almazroi et al., 2016; Binyamin, Rutter &Smith, 2019; Davis, 1989; Davis et al., 1989). This result aligns with other studies on learning management systems and e-learning in Saudi Arabia (Al-Aulamie, 2013; Al-Gahtani, 2016). Perceived usefulness influences future system adoption and serves as a motivational factor. Teachers agreed that they intended to use Madrasati in their future teaching, which significantly affects the actual use of Madrasati. According to Binyamin, Rutter &Smith (2019), when users are strongly willing to use LMS, this enhances the actual usage, and this is consistent with technology models TRA, the TPB, the TAM, the A-TAM, the TAM2, as well as studies on e-learning (Alenezi, 2012; Alenezi, 2011; Baleghi-Zadeh et al., 2017)."

            "heading": "CONCLUSION",
            "text": "The findings show that teachers positively perceive Madrasati in terms of external variables, including the content quality of the platform, teacher support, the visual design, system navigation features, ease of access, system interactivity, instructional assessment tools, and perceived system learnability. This study sheds light on the importance of specific external variables in LMS previously discussed in the literature as determinants of the system\u2019s usability and ease of use, according to TAM. These\nvariables apply to Madrasati LMS as well. Future studies can explore other variables that can influence LMS in general and Madrasati in specific that could potentially have a significant impact on teachers\u2019 acceptance of the system, such as students\u2019 self-paced digital courses\u2019 tools, including analytics, chatbots, adaptive content, courses, and gamification of the learning experience.\nFuture studies can also explore the significance of knowledge base materials and embedded professional development resources within the system to enhance teachers\u2019 instructional design skills and digital competencies within the e-learning system portal. Future studies can explore the role of demographical factors on the external variables and TAM of Madrasati, such as online teaching experience and instructional design skills. Further, the TAM of Madrasati can be linked to other essential theories on technology, pedagogy, and content knowledge and how these variables can influence technology acceptance. Further, teachers from different disciplines must participate in senior advisory boards at various educational leadership levels to provide their insights and recommendation for better teaching and learning experience using Madrasati to leverage its usability and ease of use. In addition, students and their parents\u2019 perspectives using Madrasati is another crucial area of research that can be further explored to compare student and teachers\u2019 perspectives about the use of the e-learning system during the Pandemic to facilitate improvement and teaching strategies keeping students\u2019 experience in mind while using the system.\nHowever, this research had several limitations that might have impacted the results and conclusions of this study. First, there is a lack of prior studies on Madrasati and K-12 online education in Saudi Arabia due to the recent implementation of Madrasati and emergency remote education conditions in Saudi Arabia in response to COVID-19, which impacted the ability to link the study results to other related variables. However, this can be an important opportunity to identify literature gaps and include new research areas to improve Madrasati and e-learning for K-12 students. Further, the evaluation of Madrasati\u2019s usability and ease of use features was self-reported as the study is descriptive. Therefore, the results must be interpreted with caution. More in-depth statistical and qualitative investigations regarding the correlations between the system\u2019s key constructs with a larger sample size need to be conducted to extend the knowledge base on this new e-learning experience in Saudi Arabia and the new K-12 distance teaching. Finally, this study is limited in place, time, and scope, covering only the Saudi e-learning system. Future studies can focus on international K-12 teachers\u2019 response to using LMS for the first time during disruptive times. Other studies can explore teachers\u2019 attitudes toward Madrasati and their acceptance of the technology under normal schooling conditions.\nCOMPeTING INTeReSTS\nThe author of this publication declares there are no competing interests."
