    "abstractText": "We present recent results on the spectrum of a confining flux tube that is closed around a spatial torus as a function of its length as well as the spectrum of glueballs. The extraction of the spectra has been realized by simulating four dimensional SU (N) gauge theories and performing measurements using lattice techniques. Regarding flux-tubes, we have performed calculations for N = 3, 5, 6 and for various values of spin, parity and longitudinal momentum. Long flux-tubes can be thought of as infinitesimally thin strings; hence their spectrum is expected to be described by an effective string theory. Furthermore, the flux-tube\u2019s internal structure makes possible the existence of massive states in addition to string modes. Our calculations demonstrate that although most states exhibit a spectrum which can be approximated adequately by Nambu-Goto there is strong evidence for the existence of a massive axion on the world-sheet of the QCD flux-tube as well as a bound state of two such axions. Regarding glueballs, we extracted spectra from N = 2 to N = 12 which enables us to extrapolate to N = \u221e. Our main aim was to calculate the lightest glueball masses for all different configurations of the quantum numbers of spin, parity and charge conjugation. This provides a major update on the spectrum of glueballs in the planar limit.",

            "text": "During the last three decades lattice gauge theory simulations provided useful information towards the physics of the \u2019t Hooft\u2019s large-\ud835\udc41 limit of gauge theories as well as QCD. In parallel, the \"second superstring revolution\" of Maldacena\u2019s AdS/CFT correspondence bloomed leading to gauge-gravity dualities. Such dualities between weakly coupled string theories and strongly coupled gauge theories at large-\ud835\udc41 , have led to a common interest in what the physics of the large-\ud835\udc41 gauge theories is.\nUnderstanding the large-\ud835\udc41 limit of gauge theories requires the investigation of masses of associated states. The simplest such states one can consider are gluballs and flux-tubes, with both states reflecting hadronic dynamics. The calculation of the spectrum of these excitations has been a matter of investigation by both, lattice gauge theories as well as strings including AdS/CFT duality and effective bosonic string theory. In addition a more straightforward relation between these two fields has been established: lattice provides data extracted considering first principles for comparison with strings.\nIn QCD the quarks are confined in bound states by forming open flux-tubes. Long flux-tubes behave similarly to thin strings: If you pull the string apart, at some point it breaks; thus the term confining strings. However, to observe such a phenomenon in a lattice QCD calculation it requires the introduction of dynamical quarks (sea quarks) in the Markov-chain simulation used in production of configurations. We consider pure gauge theories where such effects do not appear. By placing the confining flux-tube in a given position in space we expect \ud835\udc37 \u2212 2 massless modes to propagate along the string arising from the spontaneously broken translation invariance in the \ud835\udc37\u22122 directions transverse to the flux. We, thus, expect that there should be a low energy effective string theory describing such oscillating modes. Although, a flux-tube can be considered effectively as a thin string, it also has an intrinsic width. This suggests that massive states related to the intrinsic structure of the tube may exist in the spectrum. One can investigate, whether, such states exist by extracting the flux-tube spectrum, compare it with an effective string theory model and identify states which exhibit significant deviations from a theoretical description. A naive expectation would be that a massive mode has the characteristics of a resonance with energy gap of the order of the mass gap (scalar glueball mass \u223c \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc3a) of the theory. For reasons of simplicity, we investigated the spectrum of the closed flux-tube which winds around the spatial lattice torus, thus the name \"torelon\". This set up avoids the consideration of the effect of the static quarks on the spectrum, and focuses on the dynamics of the flux-tube. In the past it has been demonstrated [1] that the confining string in \ud835\udc37 = 2 + 1 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc48 (\ud835\udc41) gauge theories can be adequately approximated by the Nambu-Goto free string in flat space-time, from short to long flux-tubes, without any massive excitations showing up. Furthermore, we demonstrated [2] that the spectrum of the closed flux-tube in \ud835\udc37 = 3+1 consists mostly of string-like states but in contrast to the \ud835\udc37 = 2 + 1 case a number of excitations with quantum number \ud835\udc3d\ud835\udc43 = 0\u2212 appeared to be in accordance with the characteristics of a massive excitation. In 2013, Dubovsky et al, [3] demonstrated that this state arises naturally if one includes a Polyakov topological piece in the string theoretical action. Our old results were poor - spectrum has been extracted for a few string lengths, and for low statistics. Recently, we proceeded towards a major improvement of the previous investigation on \ud835\udc37 = 3+1 by extracting the spectrum of the flux-tube for all the irreducible\nP o S ( C O R F U 2 0 2 1 ) 1 6 8\nrepresentations expanded by the quantum numbers (QNs) {|\ud835\udc3d |, \ud835\udc43\u22a5, \ud835\udc43 \u2225} using three values of color \ud835\udc41 , namely \ud835\udc41 = 3, 5, 6, as well as by probing through a large set of flux-tube lengths. In addition to flux-tubes we have also improved the older glueball spectra calculations in the Large-\ud835\udc41 limit. Our main aim in this work is to provide a calculation of the low-lying \u2018glueball\u2019 mass spectrum for all quantum numbers and all values of \ud835\udc41 . This means calculating the lowest states in all the irreducible representions, \ud835\udc45, of the rotation group of a cubic lattice, and for both values of parity \ud835\udc43 and charge conjugation parity \ud835\udc36. We do so by performing calculations in the corresponding lattice gauge theories over a sufficient range of lattice spacings, and with enough precision that we can obtain plausible continuum extrapolations. We also put effort to extrapolate to the \ud835\udc41 = \u221e limit and to compare this to the physically interesting \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc48 (3) theory. To do so we have performed our calculations for \ud835\udc41 = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12 gauge theories. The structure of these proceedings is the following. First, in Section 2 we provide a short chapter on the Large-\ud835\udc41 limit to remind ourselves the basic properties of the physics on the planar limit. Then in Section 3 we present the effective string theoretical descriptions suitable for approximating the spectrum of the confining string. Subsequently in Section 4, we provide a brief description of the lattice setup, by explaining how one can extract the masses of colour singlets on the lattice as well as the quantum numbers relevant for the extraction of the flux-tube and glueball spectra. Followingly, in Section 5 we move to the presentation of the results starting from the spectra of confining strings, demonstrating the appearance of the worldsheet axion and proceeding to the spectrum of glueballs. Finally, in Section 6, we conclude."

However, due to the fact that the scale invariance is anomalous, setting \ud835\udc542 to some particular value \ud835\udc542\ud835\udc60 , we can only hope to use it as a useful expansion parameter for physics close to the scale \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc60 for which the running coupling takes that value; in other words where \ud835\udc542(\ud835\udc59 = \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc60) \u2243 \ud835\udc542\ud835\udc60 . An alternative but more general expansion might be provided by 1/\ud835\udc41 as t\u2019 Hooft suggested, back in 1974. One can think of expanding \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc48 (\ud835\udc41) gauge theories in powers of 1/\ud835\udc412 around \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc48 (\u221e):\n\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc48 (\ud835\udc41) = \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc48 (\u221e) +\ud835\udc42 (1/\ud835\udc412). (1)\nAccording to the t\u2019 Hooft\u2019s double line representation for the gluon propagators and the associated vertices, ignoring for simplicity the difference between\ud835\udc48 (\ud835\udc41) and \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc48 (\ud835\udc41), the expansion parameter can be expressed as 1/\ud835\udc412. As a result, a smooth large-\ud835\udc41 limit can be achieved if one keeps the parameter \ud835\udc542\ud835\udc41 fixed. This can be viewed by considering a gluon loop insertion in the gluon propagator using the double-line notation as this is pictorially represented on the left panel of Figure 1. The two vertices give a factor of \ud835\udc542 and the sum over the colour index in the closed loop gives a factor of \ud835\udc41 . Hence, such an insertion will produce a factor of \ud835\udc542\ud835\udc41 in the amplitude. To ensure smooth physics as increasing \ud835\udc41 \u2192 \u221e we require that the number of such insertions in the diagrams dominating the physics of interest are roughly fixed as we alter \ud835\udc41 . The above requires that we keep \ud835\udf06 = \ud835\udc542\ud835\udc41 fixed. Such diagrams can be mapped on a plane and can, thus, be called planar. On the other hand diagrams on which glue propagators cross, cannot be mapped on a plane but can\nP o S ( C O R F U 2 0 2 1 ) 1 6 8\nbe resembled as planar diagrams with handles; an example of such a diagram is presented in the right panel of Figure 1. This non-planar Feynman diagram has six vertices and just one circulating loop, which means that the expression will be proportional to \u223c \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc546 = \ud835\udf063/\ud835\udc412 \ud835\udc41\u2192\u221e\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 0. This is a naive way to demonstrate that the non-planar Feynman diagrams vanish in the large-\ud835\udc41 limit. It is also straightforward to show that a Feynman diagram that contains virtual quark loops will get suppressed in the large-\ud835\udc41 limit. Therefore, at the \u2019t Hooft limit only planar Feynman diagrams without quark loops survive.\nSo far we are making the assumption that there is a confining phase in the large-\ud835\udc41 limit. This is based on numerical evidence. For instance, flux-tubes and glueballs exist and their masses extrapolate well in the Large-\ud835\udc41 limit. We draw this conclusion by performing calculations for \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc48 (\ud835\udc41) gauge theory and a sequence of finite values of \ud835\udc41 . Of course it would be nice to show that there is in fact a large-\ud835\udc41 confining phase, and that a smooth physics limit does in fact exist.\nAt this point it should be made clear that there is no expectation that all the physics of \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc48 (3) is close to that of \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc48 (\u221e). We can only make sure that an observable in \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc48 (3) is close to that of \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc48 (\u221e) once we perform the calculation. It could be possible that other large-\ud835\udc41 limits are more appropriate for the physics under investigation. For instance in QCD where we have 2 or 3 light flavours, \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc53 /\ud835\udc41 \u223c 1. Hence, it could appear possible that the limit \ud835\udc41 \u2192 \u221e by keeping \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc53 /\ud835\udc41 fixed might be more appropriate for some physical quantities [4]. A nice review where several such limits are being discuss is provided in Ref. [5]"

            "text": "Systematic ways to study Lorentz invariant EST which can describe the confining string were pioneered by L\u00fcscher, Symanzik, and Weisz in [8] (static gauge) as well as by Polchinski and Strominger in [9] (conformal gauge). Such approaches produce predictions for the energy of states as an expansion in 1/\ud835\udc59 \u221a \ud835\udf0e. Terms in this expansion of\ud835\udc42 (1/\ud835\udc59 \ud835\udc5d) are generated by (\ud835\udc5d +1) - derivative terms in the EST action whose coefficients are a priori arbitrary Low Energy Coefficients (LECs). Interestingly, these LECs were shown to obey strong constraints that reflect a non-linear realization of Lorentz symmetry [10\u201312], and so to give parameter free predictions for certain terms in the 1/\ud835\udc59 expansion. The EST approaches can be characterised by the way one performs the gauge fixing of the embedding coordinates on the world-sheet. This can be either the static gauge [8, 10, 12] or the conformal gauge [9, 13, 14] with both routes leading to the same results. The starting point of building the EST is the leading area term which gives rise to the linearly rising potential for large strings i.e. \ud835\udc38 \u2243 \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc59. Subsequently comes the Gaussian action which is responsible for the \u221d 1/\ud835\udc59 L\u00fcscher term with universal coefficient depending only on the dimension \ud835\udc37. At next step one adds the 4-derivative terms which yield a correction on the energy spectrum proportional to 1/\ud835\udc593 with a universal coefficient that also depends on the dimension \ud835\udc37. One can include the 6\u2212derivative terms and show that for \ud835\udc37 = 3 they yield the fourth universal term proportional to 1/\ud835\udc595 in the energy spectrum, while for general states in \ud835\udc37 = 4, the coefficient of the \ud835\udc42 (1/\ud835\udc595) term is not universal. Nonetheless, the energy just for the ground state in the \ud835\udc37 = 4 case is universal.

            "text": "In 2013, Dubovsky et al. worked out an approach for extracting the spectrum of the confining string for short as well as for long lengths. The idea was based on the fact that the GGRT string provides the best approximation for the flux-tube spectrum and that Equation 2 can be re-expressed as \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc3f ,\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc45 = \u221a \ud835\udf0eE(\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc58/ \u221a \ud835\udf0e, 1/\ud835\udc59 \u221a \ud835\udf0e) where \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc58 are the momenta of individual phonons in units of 2\ud835\udf0b/\ud835\udc59 comprising the state quantised. The naive expansion in terms of 1/\ud835\udc59 \u221a \ud835\udf0e is the combination of two different expansions; the first is an expansion in the softness of individual quanta compared to the string scale, i.e. in \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc58/ \u221a \ud835\udf0e and the second expansion is a large volume expansion, i.e. an expansion in 1/\ud835\udc59 \u221a \ud835\udf0e. To disentangle the two expansions the following procedure is being adopted. First, one calculates the infinite volume \ud835\udc46-matrix of the phonon collisions. This is done perturbativelly given that the center of mass energy of the colliding phonons is small in string units; this is called the momentum expansion. Followingly, the authors extracted the finite volume energies from this \ud835\udc46-matrix by using approximate integrability and the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA). This allows to extract the winding effects on the energy from virtual quanta traveling around the circle as well as the winding corrections due to phonon interactions.\nThe authors argued that when a state has only left-moving phonons the GGRT winding corrections in the string spectrum are small and, therefore, one expects the spectrum to be close to that of the free theory. On the contrary, for states containing both left- and right-moving phonons, energy corrections are larger. The above is in a good agreement with most of the states in \ud835\udc37 = 4 but fails to provide an explanation for the anomalous behaviour of the pseudoscalar level 0\u2212\u2212 firstly demonstrated in [2, 16], suggesting that an additional action term is required in order to describe such excitations. The most straightforward way to do this is the introduction of a massive pseudoscalar particle \ud835\udf11 on the world-sheet. The leading interaction compatible with non-linearly realized Lorentz invariance for such a state is a coupling to the topological invariant known as the self-intersection number of the string \ud835\udc46int = \ud835\udefc8\ud835\udf0b \u222b \ud835\udc512\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf11\ud835\udc3e \ud835\udc56\ud835\udefc\ud835\udefe\ud835\udc3e \ud835\udc57\ud835\udefe \ud835\udefd \ud835\udf16 \ud835\udefc\ud835\udefd\ud835\udf16\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc57 with \ud835\udc3e \ud835\udc56\ud835\udefc\ud835\udefe being the extrinsic curvature of the world-sheet, \ud835\udefc the associated coupling and \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc56 , \ud835\udc56 = 1, 2 the world-sheet coordinates. Adapting the above interaction term to our old results for \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc48 (3), \ud835\udefd = 6.0625 yields a mass of\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udf11/ \u221a \ud835\udf0e \u2243 1.85+0.02\u22120.03 and a coupling of \ud835\udefc = 9.6 \u00b1 0.1."

The overlap can be maximized by building operator(s) which \"capture\" the right properties of the state, in other words by projecting onto the right quantum numbers as well as onto the physical length scales of the relevant state. In order to achieve a decay behaviour setting in at low values of \ud835\udc61 one has to minimize contributions from excited states. To this purpose we employ the variational calculation or GEVP (Generalized Eigenvalue Problem) [18, 19] applied to a basis of operators built by several lattice path in different blocking levels [20\u201322].

The above group is a subgroup of\ud835\udc42 (2) corresponding to rotations by integer multiples of \ud835\udf0b/2 around the flux-tube propagation axis. This splits the Hilbert space in four orthogonal sectors,\nP o S ( C O R F U 2 0 2 1 ) 1 6 8\nnamely: \ud835\udc3dmod 4 = 0, \ud835\udc3dmod 4 = \u00b11, \ud835\udc3dmod 4 = 2. Furthermore, parity \ud835\udc43\u22a5 which is associated with reflections around the axis \u22a5\u03021 can be used to characterise the states. Applying \ud835\udc43\u22a5 transformations, flips the sign of \ud835\udc3d. Therefore, one can choose a basis in which states are characterised by their value of \ud835\udc3d (\ud835\udc3d = \u00b1), or by their value of |\ud835\udc3d | and \ud835\udc43\u22a5. We adopt the latter. In the continuum, states with \ud835\udc3d \u2260 0 are parity degenerate, however, on the lattice this holds only for the odd values of \ud835\udc3d. In practice, we describe our states with the following 5 irreducible representations \ud835\udc341, \ud835\udc342, \ud835\udc38 , \ud835\udc351 and \ud835\udc352 of \ud835\udc364 group whose \ud835\udc3d and \ud835\udc43\u22a5 assignments are: {\ud835\udc341 : |\ud835\udc3dmod 4 | = 0, \ud835\udc43\u22a5 = +} , {\ud835\udc342 : |\ud835\udc3dmod 4 | = 0, \ud835\udc43\u22a5 = \u2212}, {\ud835\udc38 : |\ud835\udc3dmod 4 | = 1, \ud835\udc43\u22a5 = \u00b1}, {\ud835\udc351 : |\ud835\udc3dmod 4 | = 2, \ud835\udc43\u22a5 = +} and {\ud835\udc352 : |\ud835\udc3dmod 4 | = 2, \ud835\udc43\u22a5 = \u2212}. Furthermore, there is the longitudinal momentum \ud835\udc5d | | carried by the confining string along its axis (which is quantized in the form \ud835\udc5d | | = 2\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc5e/\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc65; \ud835\udc5e \u2208 \ud835\udc4d) and the parity \ud835\udc43 | | with respect to reflections across the string midpoint. Since \ud835\udc43 | | and \ud835\udc5d | | do not commute, we can use both to simultaneously characterise a state only when \ud835\udc5e = 0. The energy does not depend on the sign of momentum \ud835\udc5e and we, thus, focused on those with \ud835\udc5e \u2265 0.\n\ud835\udc47 \u2212 \ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udf19 \u2020 \ud835\udc56\n\ud835\udf19 \ud835\udc57\nFigure 2: A pictorialisation of the torelon correlation function in \ud835\udc37 = 2 Euclidean dimensions.\nFlux-tube energies are extracted by making use of correlation matrices\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc57 = \u27e8\ud835\udf19\u2020\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61)\ud835\udf19 \ud835\udc57 (0)\u27e9 with \ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc57 = 1...\ud835\udc41op in combination with GEVP where \ud835\udc41op the number of operators. A pictorialisation of a correlation function between closed flux-tube operators is provided in Figure 2. We construct operators \ud835\udf19\ud835\udc56 which encode shapes that lead to particular values of \ud835\udc3d, \ud835\udc43\u22a5, \ud835\udc43 | |, and \ud835\udc5e. We do so by choosing linear combinations of Polyakov loops the paths of which consist of various transverse deformations and various smearing and blocking levels [20]. All the transverse paths used for the construction of the operators are shown in Figure 3 and all together, including smearing and blocking levels, form a basis of around \ud835\udc41op = 1000 operators with approximately 50\u2212 200 for each different irreducible representation. To build an operator which encodes a certain value of angular momentum \ud835\udc3dmod 4 we begin the construction with a sub-operator \ud835\udf19\ud835\udefc which has a deformation extending in angle \ud835\udefc within the plane of transverse directions. Then we repeat the same procedure by rotating the sub-operator by integer values of \ud835\udf0b/2. Finally, we can construct the operator \ud835\udf19(\ud835\udc3d) belonging to a specific representation of \ud835\udc364 by using the formula \ud835\udf19(\ud835\udc3d) = \u2211 \ud835\udc5b=1,2,3,4 \ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc3d\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udf0b2 \ud835\udf19\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udf0b2 . Thus \ud835\udf19(0) belongs to \ud835\udc341 and \ud835\udc342, \ud835\udf19(1) to \ud835\udc38 and, finally, \ud835\udf19(2) to \ud835\udc351 as well as \ud835\udc352.

            "text": "The glueballs like the flux-tubes are color singlets and, thus, an operator projecting onto a glueball state is obtained by taking the ordered product of \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc48 (\ud835\udc41) link matrices however now around a contractible loop and then taking the trace. To retain the exact positivity of the correlators we use loops that contain only spatial links. The real part of the trace projects on \ud835\udc36 = + and the imaginary part on \ud835\udc36 = \u2212. We sum all spatial translations of the loop so as to obtain an operator with momentum \ud835\udc5d = 0. We take all rotations of the loop and construct the linear combinations that transform according to the irreducible representations, \ud835\udc45, of the rotational symmetry group of our cubic spatial lattice. We always choose to use a cubic spatial lattice volume (\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc67) that respects these symmetries. For each loop we also construct its parity inverse so that taking linear combinations we can construct operators of both parities, \ud835\udc43 = \u00b1. The correlators of such operators will project onto glueballs with \ud835\udc5d = 0 and the \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc36 quantum numbers of the operators concerned. All the 12 paths used for the construction of the glueball operators are provided in Figure 4.\nP o S ( C O R F U 2 0 2 1 ) 1 6 8\nFigure 4: The 12 different closed loops used for the construction of the glueball operators.\nThe irreducible representations \ud835\udc45 of our subgroup of the full rotation group are usually labelled as \ud835\udc341, \ud835\udc342, \ud835\udc38, \ud835\udc471, \ud835\udc472. Mind that these representations are different than those for the group \ud835\udc364 of the confining-string . The \ud835\udc341 is a singlet and rotationally symmetric, so it will contain the \ud835\udc3d = 0 state in the continuum limit. The \ud835\udc342 is also a singlet, while the \ud835\udc38 is a doublet and \ud835\udc471 and \ud835\udc472 are both triplets. Since, for example, the three states transforming as the triplet of \ud835\udc472 are degenerate on the lattice, we average their values and treat them as one state in our estimates of glueball masses and we do the same with the \ud835\udc471 triplets and the \ud835\udc38 doublets.\nOnce more, the glueball energies are extracted by making use of correlation matrices \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc57 = \u27e8\ud835\udf19\u2020\n\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61)\ud835\udf19 \ud835\udc57 (0)\u27e9 with \ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc57 = 1...\ud835\udc41op in combination with GEVP where \ud835\udc41op the number of operators. The scalar channel \ud835\udc34++1 has a non-zero projection onto the vacuum. In this case it can be convenient to use the vacuum-subtracted operator \ud835\udf19\ud835\udc56 \u2212 \u27e8\ud835\udf19\ud835\udc56\u27e9, which will remove the contribution of the vacuum in Equation 5, so that the lightest non-trivial state appearing in the aforementioned sum, is the leading term in the expansion of states.\nThe above representations of the rotational symmetry reflect our cubic lattice formulation. As we approach the continuum limit these states will approach the continuum glueball states which belong to representations of the continuum rotational symmetry. In other words they fall into degenerate multiplets of 2\ud835\udc3d + 1 states. In determining the continuum limit of the low-lying glueball spectrum, it is clearly more useful to be able to assign the states to a given spin \ud835\udc3d, rather than to the representations of the cubic subgroup which have a much less fine \u2018resolution\u2019 since all of \ud835\udc3d = 1, 2, 3 . . . ,\u221e, are mapped to just 5 cubic representations. The way 2\ud835\udc3d +1 states for a given \ud835\udc3d are distributed amongst the representations of the cubic symmetry subgroup is given, for the relevant low values of \ud835\udc3d, in table 1. For instance, the seven states corresponding to a \ud835\udc3d = 3 glueball will\nP o S ( C O R F U 2 0 2 1 ) 1 6 8\nbe distributed over a singlet \ud835\udc342, a degenerate triplet \ud835\udc471 and a degenerate triplet \ud835\udc472, so seven states in total. These \ud835\udc342, \ud835\udc471 and \ud835\udc472 states will be split by \ud835\udc42 (\ud835\udc4e2) lattice spacing corrections. So once the lattice spacing \ud835\udc4e is small enough these states will be nearly degenerate and one can use this near-degeneracy to identify the continuum spin.\ncontinuum \ud835\udc3d \u223c cubic \ud835\udc45 \ud835\udc3d cubic \ud835\udc45 0 \u223c \ud835\udc341 1 \u223c \ud835\udc471 2 \u223c \ud835\udc38 + \ud835\udc472 3 \u223c \ud835\udc342 + \ud835\udc471 + \ud835\udc472 4 \u223c \ud835\udc341 + \ud835\udc38 + \ud835\udc471 + \ud835\udc472 5 \u223c \ud835\udc38 + 2\ud835\udc471 + \ud835\udc472 6 \u223c \ud835\udc341 + \ud835\udc342 + \ud835\udc38 + \ud835\udc471 + 2\ud835\udc472 7 \u223c \ud835\udc342 + \ud835\udc38 + 2\ud835\udc471 + 2\ud835\udc472 8 \u223c \ud835\udc341 + 2\ud835\udc38 + 2\ud835\udc471 + 2\ud835\udc472\nTable 1: Projection of continuum spin \ud835\udc3d states onto the cubic representations \ud835\udc45."

Critical slowing down [24, 25], as one moves towards the continuum (\ud835\udc4e \u2192 0) and the large-\ud835\udc41 limit (\ud835\udc41 \u2192 \u221e), prohibits the investigation of gauge groups with \ud835\udc41 \u2265 6 and \ud835\udc4e < 0.09fm. Nevertheless, the above configuration of measurements is enough to determine whether significant lattice artifacts as well as 1/\ud835\udc412 corrections are affecting our statistically more accurate \ud835\udc41 = 3 calculations. As a matter of fact our investigation demonstrates that such effects are of minor importance and do not play a significant role in the interpretation of the spectrum. The energy spectrum we extracted is compared to the predictions of the GGRT string. Namely, we fit the absolute ground state (|\ud835\udc3dmod 4 |\ud835\udc43\u22a5\ud835\udc43| | = 0++) for all calculations using Equation 2 as a function of the length for \ud835\udc59 \u221a \ud835\udf0e > 2.5 and extract the string tension \ud835\udc4e \u221a \ud835\udf0e. Once the string tension has been extracted, Equation 2 can be used as a parameter free prediction for higher string excitations with \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc3f + \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc45 > 0."

In Figure 5, the lowest energy level corresponds to the absolute ground state |\ud835\udc3dmod 4 |\ud835\udc43\u22a5\ud835\udc43| | = 0++ which is used to set the scale of the NG string, hence, the nearly perfect agreement with the GGRT string. Furthermore in Figure 5, we plot the first excited state of 0++ as\nP o S ( C O R F U 2 0 2 1 ) 1 6 8\nwell as the ground states of 2++, 2\u2212+ and 0\u2212\u2212 for \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc48 (3) at \ud835\udefd = 6.0625. We compare the above data with the GGRT prediction for \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc45 = \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc3f = 1. This string state is expected to be four-fold degenerate with levels with continuum quantum numbers 0++, 0\u2212\u2212, 2++ and 2\u2212+ . While 0++, 2++ and 2\u2212+ flux-tube excitations appear to exhibit small deviations for short values of \ud835\udc59 \u221a \ud835\udf0e and for larger strings become consistent with GGRT, 0\u2212\u2212 ground state appears to demonstrate significant deviations from the GGRT string. In Figure 6 we present the ground and in addition the first excited state with quantum numbers 0\u2212\u2212 for all gauge groups considered in this work. It appears that both states are only mildly affected by lattice artifacts and 1/\ud835\udc412 corrections. The 0\u2212\u2212 ground state appears to have characteristics of a resonance i.e. a constant mass term coupled to the absolute ground state. This is more obvious by subtracting the absolute ground state 0++ where this excitation exhibits a plateau; this is presented in Figure 7 for \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc48 (3) at \ud835\udefd = 6.0625. As has already being explained in Section 3.3 this state can be well interpreted as an axion on the world-sheet of the flux-tube with an associated mass of \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udf11/ \u221a \ud835\udf0e = 1.85+0.02\u22120.03 for \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc48 (3) at \ud835\udefd = 6.0625; This value is in good agreement with the plateau in Figure 7. If the 0\u2212\u2212 flux-tube ground state corresponds to the axion, the next excitation level would correspond to the string-like state with \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc3f = \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc45 = 1 rather than \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc3f = \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc45 = 2. As one can see in the right panel of Figure 5, and Figure 7 the 0\u2212\u2212 first excitation state does not approach the GGRT \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc3f = \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc45 = 2 state but instead it slowly approaches the \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc3f = \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc45 = 1 string state.

This is more obvious if we subtract from this energy level the contribution of the absolute ground state as this appears in Figure 9. Namely, we observe that this is in agreement with a resonance of mass twice that of the axion. This raises the question whether such a relation is accidental or it has some deeper interpretation. A reasonable expectation would be that this state is a bound state of two axions with a very low binding energy; this scenario is in agreement with the quantum numbers of the state."

Since, the string ground state \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc3f = 1, \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc45 = 0 can only be created by a single phonon, it has \ud835\udc3d = 1. The flux-tube ground state with quantum numbers 1\u00b1, \ud835\udc5e = 1 appears to be in good agreement with the prediction of the GGRT string. This is in accordance with the results of Ref [3]. The next string excitation level, corresponding to \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc3f = 2 and \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc45 = 1 should be seven-fold degenerate.

We, thus, extract the flux-tube ground states with the above quantum numbers and observe that they all cluster around the GGRT prediction. The next string excitation level is multi-fold degenerate and should also include a 0\u2212 state which encodes the quantum numbers of the axion. We extract the flux-tube ground state with quantum numbers 0\u2212 and we observe a very similar behaviour as for the case of \ud835\udc5e = 1; namely it diverges greatly from the GGRT prediction."

Since this refers to technical aspects of the calculation and is, thus, beyond the scope of this presentation, we refer the reader to the actual publication [24]. For the gauge groups presented above, we calculated glueball masses from the correlators of suitable operators which have been encoded zero momentum \ud835\udc5d = 0 by imposing translation invariance. These operators are chosen to have quantum numbers \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc36 as this has been presented in Section 4.1. 12 different closed loops on the lattice have been used to facilitate the Generalized Eigenvalue Problem; all the loops are presented in Figure 4. For each different loop all 24 rotations as well as their linear combinations of the traces that transform irreducibly under \ud835\udc45 have been constructed. By taking the real and imaginary parts of the traces separately, we build operators with \ud835\udc36 = \u00b1 respectively. We also calculate the parity inverses of each of these 12 closed loops, and of their rotations, and by adding and subtracting appropriate operators from these two sets we form operators for each configuration of the quantum numbers \ud835\udc45 with \ud835\udc43 = \u00b1. Once more, states in cubic representations \ud835\udc341 and \ud835\udc342 appear to be one-dimensional, meaning that for each energy level we have only one such state. States in the \ud835\udc38 representation are doubly degenerate (two-dimensional) and in the \ud835\udc471 and \ud835\udc472 are triply degenerate (three-dimensional). Lattice simulations are computationally intensive, and for reasons of computational economy we wish to perform calculations on lattice volumes that are small but, at the same time, large enough so that any finite volume effects do not interfere with the physics under investigation. The computational cost of simulating and calculating in \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc48 (\ud835\udc41) gauge theories increases approximately as \u221d \ud835\udc413 due to the multiplication of two \ud835\udc41 \u00d7 \ud835\udc41 matrices. Since finite volume corrections are expected to decrease as powers of 1/\ud835\udc41 , we reduce the size in physical units of our lattices as we increase \ud835\udc41 .

There are two types of such finite volume corrections. The first arises when the propagating glueball emits a virtual glueball which propagates around the spatial torus. The shift caused by the virtual gluballs in the mass of the propagating glueball decreases exponentially in \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc65 with \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc65 being the length of the spatial torus. For the glueball calculation we choose \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc65 so that \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc3a \u00d7 \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc65/\ud835\udc4e is large enough and, thus, we can expect this correction to be small. Details on the choice of \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc65 can be found in Ref. [24]. Similar source of finite volume effects is also present in the confining-string spectrum where in order to ensure that such effects are under control we have\nP o S ( C O R F U 2 0 2 1 ) 1 6 8\nchosen the transverse directions of the lattice \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc67 to be adequately large. The second type of finite volume effects in the glueball spectrum includes states composed of several flux-tubes winding around a spatial torus in a singlet state. The lightest of these states will be composed of one winding flux-tube together with a conjugate winding flux-tube and we, thus, refer to it as a \u2018ditorelon\u2019. These states have a non-zero overlap onto the loops (Figure 4) we use as our glueball operators. Therefore, it can appear as a state in our extracted glueball spectrum. Neglecting interactions between the flux-tubes, the lightest ditorelon will consist of each flux tube in its ground state with zero momentum and will have an energy, \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc51 , that is twice that of the flux tube absolute ground state \ud835\udc38gs, \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc51 = 2\ud835\udc38gs. In principle we expect interactions to shift the energy but this shift should be small on the volumes we have chosen. Hence, we shall use \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc51 \u2243 2\ud835\udc38gs as a rough estimate in searching for these states. The ditorelon ground state contributes only to the \ud835\udc34++1 and \ud835\udc38++ representations. If we allow one or both of the component flux tubes to be excited and/or to have non-zero equal and opposite transverse momenta we can populate other representations and produce towers of states. However, these excited ditorelon states will be considerably heavier on the lattice volumes we use. Ditorelon contributions in the \ud835\udc34++1 and \ud835\udc38\n++ channels have been investigated in detail in the longer write-up. Namely, operators which have been constructed in such a way so that they maximise the overlap onto ditorelon states have been used. This enabled us to identify ditorelon states which appeared in the calculated glueball spectra and ensure that the quoted glueball spectrum consists solely of glueball states."

As can be seen all the fits appear to be linear, confirming the expression provided in Equation 7.

However, from a theoretical point of view, the most interesting glueball spectra are those of the \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc48 (\ud835\udc41 \u2192 \u221e) theory since the theoretical simplifications in that limit make it the most likely case to be accessible to analytic solution, whether complete or partial.

The majority of the states appearing in the spectrum are string-like, in the sense they can be adequately approximated by a low energy effective string theory. In addition a small sector of the excitation spectrum appears to be massive resonances which can be interpreted as an axion on the world-sheet of the theory. We concluded to the above by the resonance character of the 0\u2212\u2212, \ud835\udc5e = 0 ground state which appears to be an axion coupled to the string\u2019s absolute ground state, by the 0++ second excited state which can be interpreted as a bound state of two axions with a very low binding energy coupled to the absolute ground state as well as by the 0\u2212 \ud835\udc5e = 1, 2 ground states which also have an axion character. Furthermore, states with axionic character can also be identified in other irreducible representations such as |\ud835\udc3dmod 4 |\ud835\udc43\u22a5 = 1\u00b1;\nP o S ( C O R F U 2 0 2 1 ) 1 6 8\n\ud835\udc45 \ud835\udc43 = +, \ud835\udc36 = + \ud835\udc43 = \u2212, \ud835\udc36 = + \ud835\udc43 = +, \ud835\udc36 = \u2212 \ud835\udc43 = \u2212, \ud835\udc36 = \u2212 \ud835\udc341 3.072(14) 4.711(25) 9.26(16) 10.10(18)\n5.805(31) 7.050(68) 10.14(23) 7.294(63)\n\ud835\udc342 7.40(12) 9.73(12) 7.142(75) 8.61(13) 9.14(14) 11.12(24) 8.77(10) 11.38(21) \ud835\udc38 4.582(14) 6.108(44) 8.63(10) 7.951(53) 6.494(33) 8.051(60) 9.14(15) 9.55(13) 7.266(50) 9.84(12) \ud835\udc471 7.250(47) 8.412(76) 5.760(25) 7.134(86) 7.337(60) 8.79(10) 7.020(39) 8.65(9) 9.142(82) 9.08(12) 7.470(55) 9.81(17) 8.422(84) \ud835\udc472 4.578(11) 5.965(28) 6.957(41) 7.96(8)\n6.579(30) 7.883(57) 7.93(11) 8.22(8) 7.121(45) 8.45(14) 8.63(7) 10.26(10) 7.122(76)\nTable 2: Continuum glueball masses in units of the string tension, in the limit \ud835\udc41 \u2192 \u221e.

Finally, the spectrum of the confining string, including the axionic modes appears to have insignificant large-\ud835\udc41 effects. Additionally, this manuscript presents the calculation of the glueball spectra of a range of \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc48 (\ud835\udc41) gauge theories, in the continuum limit as well as their extrapolations to the theoretically interesting \ud835\udc41 \u2192 \u221e limit. This investigation provided the first calculation of the masses of the ground states in all the \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc36 irreducible representations, as well as some excited states in most such channels, in the continuum limit of the \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc48 (\u221e). These results have improved existing calculations [20, 28, 29] while largely confirming existing results. The main conclusion of this work is that \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc48 (3) is close enough\nP o S ( C O R F U 2 0 2 1 ) 1 6 8\nto \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc48 (\u221e). Namely, the \ud835\udc3d\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc36 = 0++ scalar ground state has a mass of \ud835\udc400++ \u223c 3.41 \u221a \ud835\udf0e for \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc48 (3) to \ud835\udc400++ \u223c 3.07 \u221a \ud835\udf0e for \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc48 (\u221e), the next heavier glueballs are the tensor with a mass of \ud835\udc402++ \u223c 1.5\ud835\udc400++ and the pseudoscalar 0\u2212+ which appears to be nearly degenerate with the tensor. Moving higher in energies, we encounter the 1+\u2212 with \ud835\udc401+\u2212 \u223c 1.85\ud835\udc400++ , and this is the only relatively light \ud835\udc36 = \u2212 state. With approximately the same mass comes the first excited 0++ state and then the lightest pseudotensor with \ud835\udc402\u2212+ \u223c 1.95\ud835\udc400++ follows. All other states are heavier than twice the lightest scalar, with most of the \ud835\udc36 = \u2212 ground states being very much heavier."
