There is a high unmet\nneed for new immunomodulatory, steroid-sparing therapies, since only\nciclosporin A and a single TNF-\u03b1-blocker are approved for non-infectious\nuveitis. A new small molecule inhibitor of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase\n(DHODH), an enzyme pivotal for de novo synthesis of pyrimidines, has a high\npotency for suppressing T and B cells and has already proven highly effective\nfor treating uveitis in experimental rat models. Systemic and intraocular\napplication of KIO-100 (PP-001) (previously called PP-001, now KIO-100)\ncould efficiently suppress rat uveitis in a preventive as well as therapeutic\nmode. Here we describe the outcome of the first clinical phase 1 trial\ncomparing three different doses of a single intraocular injection of KIO-100\n(PP-001) in patients with non-infectious posterior segment uveitis. No toxic\nside effects on intraocular tissues or other adverse events were observed,\nwhile intraocular inflammation decreased, and visual acuity significantly\nimproved.

            "text": "Within the group of intraocular inflammatory diseases, noninfectious uveitis is supposed to be of autoimmune origin. It often runs a chronic or relapsing course and has a high risk of visual deterioration and burden of illness, especially if the posterior segment of the eye is involved. Systemic treatment modalities include corticosteroids, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, ciclosporin A and adalimumab, a TNF-alpha inhibitor (1, 2). Intravitreal treatments consist of corticosteroids only, which are associated with significant local side effects like cataract and glaucoma (3). Therefore, novel intraocular anti-inflammatory strategies are still an unmet need.\nThe disease is mediated by T helper cells of the Th1 and Th17 type, which must be activated to be able to pass the blood eye-barriers that protect the immune privileged eye from assaults of the immune system (4\u20136). Activated leukocytes may enter the inner eye and screen for potential pathogens, but only those T cells that recognize their antigen presented within the eye can get reactivated to secrete chemokines and cytokines for recruiting inflammatory cells like macrophages and granulocytes to the eye, which cause the typical signs of inflammation and tissue destruction (7, 8).\nUpon activation, T cells but also B cells have an increased need of nucleotides for mRNA and DNA synthesis. Activated T cells have an 8-fold increased need of pyrimidines, which cannot be provided from the salvage pool, therefore de novo synthesis of nucleobases must be initiated (9\u201311). A pivotal enzyme for the synthesis of pyrimidines is dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), which can be blocked by the small molecule KIO100 (PP-001) 150-times more potently than by leflunomide (12\u201314).\nTo prove the efficiency of KIO-100 (PP-001) on uveitis we have used two rat models of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU), a chronic, clinically monophasic disease with chorioretinal neovascularization as later sequel, and a spontaneous relapsing-remitting disease. In both models we first applied the small molecule orally to obtain a systemic immunosuppression for preventing uveitis by treatment starting with immunization, but we were also successful with late treatment in ongoing disease, reducing relapses and neovascularization. In vitro, rat T cell proliferation and cytokine secretion was significantly suppressed in a dose-dependent manner (13).\nTo avoid a general systemic immunosuppression, we also applied the small molecule locally by intraocular injection into rat eyes (15). The rationale of this experiment was to inhibit the intraocular reactivation of the autoreactive T cells and their ability to recruit inflammatory cells. We could show that a single intraocular injection of KIO-100 (PP-001) after the resolution of the primary course of relapsing EAU significantly inhibited the frequency and intensity of relapses in the small moleculetreated eyes compared with vehicle treatment. According to the\npharmacokinetics (PK) performed in rabbits the concentration of the injected KIO-100 (PP-001) in the eye had dropped to 10% after 12 h and was not detectable any more after 96 h, while the immunosuppressive effect in the rat model was lasting for at least 6 days. We hypothesized that the intravitreally injected small molecule targeted the T cells, which were present in the eye at that time and prevented their reactivation and thus the induction of recurrent inflammation. No adverse effects on intraocular tissues were observed, and in vitro investigations with a human retinal pigment epithelial cell line revealed no toxic effect on this cell type with respect of viability, proliferation, and cytokine/chemokine production (15).\nHere we show the results of a prospective, first in man phase 1 clinical trial in patients with posterior uveitis, the type of autoimmune disease, which has the greatest risk for retinal destruction and permanent vision loss. Twelve patients with chronic, non-infectious, bilateral uveitis from six centers received a single intravitreal injection of 0.3, 0.6, or 1.2 \u00b5g KIO-100 (PP-001), respectively. In addition to the assessment of general and uveitis-specific ocular symptoms and visual acuity, pharmacokinetic evaluation of plasma levels of the study drug was performed. Except for some minor side effects related to the injection procedure but not to the study drug we found no major systemic or ocular side effects, especially no increase of intraocular pressure. Plasma levels of the small molecule were below the detection limit in our patients. Within the first week visual acuity increased in a dose-dependent fashion in all eyes until the end of the study on day 28, despite a very short intraocular half-life of the study drug. In addition to a regression of intraocular inflammation a decrease of retinal thickness was found in 3 of 4 eyes 2 weeks after receiving the 1.2 \u00b5g dose and a reduction of cystoid macular edema (CME) in two eyes with doses of 0.6 or 1.2 \u00b5g. Thus, in this phase 1 trial the new DHODH inhibitor KIO-100 (PP-001) presented as a potential and promising new drug for the intraocular treatment of uveitis."

Pharmacological investigations revealed that the amount of the study drug in the plasma of rabbits after intravitreal injection of high doses of KIO-100 (PP-001) was negligibly low. The half-life of KIO-100 (PP-001) in rabbit eyes after intravitreal injection was between 12 and 21 h, and all toxicity studies proved safety of this drug. The study drug was applied once intravitreally in a sterile, buffered, isotonic aqueous solution."

The study was registered with the Paul-Ehrlich-Institute in Langen, Germany and listed at ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03634475.\nFor this first-in-man, open-label, phase-1 clinical trial 12 patients with bilateral chronic, non-infectious intermediate, posterior or pan-uveitis as defined by the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) Working Group (19) were selected to receive a single intravitreal injection of KIO-100 (PP-001) in one eye. All patients had structural and vision threatening complications. For each patient only the worse eye was injected. Male or female patients at the age of at least 18 years were eligible and had to use two combined methods of contraception if females or female partners of male participants were in an age of childbearing potential. All females had to undergo a negative pregnancy test. Systemic or ocular infection had to be ruled out. Best corrected ETDRS (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study) visual acuity had to be better than 10 (20/630), and worse than 50 letters (20/100) in the study eye, and 70 letters (20/40) or better in the fellow eye.\nAny disease activity was acceptable, so there was no minimum requirement for disease activity according to the SUN criteria (19), since treatment effects as frequently referred to\nin phase 2 or 3 clinical trials were not a primary target in this phase 1 trial.\nMost importantly, exclusion criteria included significant media opacities, any ongoing systemic treatment with biologicals or cytostatic agents, fluocinolone implants within the past 3 years, dexamethasone-implants within 6 months or any other intravitreal injection within 90 days before injection with KIO-100 (PP-001) (day 0). Patients with uncontrolled glaucoma, hypotony, aphacic eyes or eyes with anterior but not posterior chamber lens were also excluded; see Supplementary Table 2 for the complete list of inclusion and exclusion criteria.\nThe primary study objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of ascending doses of KIO-100 (PP-001) in patients with chronic, non-infectious uveitis when administered as a single intravitreal injection of 100 \u00b5l containing 0.3, 0.6, or 1.2 \u00b5g KIO-100 (PP-001) (n = 4/group). Secondary objectives included the assessment of improvement of inflammation, and the pharmacokinetics (PK) of KIO-100 (PP-001) in plasma at screening, 4 \u00b1 1 h after intravitreal injection and on day 2.\nPatients were examined at screening, baseline, pre and post injection days 2, 7, 14, and 21 and at the final exit visit on day 28 after injection. A safety telephone call was scheduled on day 1.\nAssessments and procedures are listed in Table 1. For safety reasons the minimum time interval between injection of patients was 7 days to ensure sufficient time for development of adverse events before injecting the next patient. After each group of four patients and before proceeding to the next higher dose of KIO-100 (PP-001) a Data Safety Monitoring Board evaluated the safety of the previous dosing group after the final visit (day 28) of the last patient and had to consent on proceeding to the next higher dosing group."

Using a spontaneous relapsing model of rat EAU a significant suppression of relapses was still obtained when the oral KIO-100 (PP-001)-treatment was initiated in a therapeutic mode after the resolution of the first course of uveitis (13). In a chronic model of EAU, where the autoreactive T cells secrete VEGF and thus induce chorioretinal neovascularization (CNV), also CNV-induction was significantly reduced by inhibiting T cells and their VEGF secretion when the oral KIO-100 (PP-001)-treatment was commenced during ongoing disease. Both, proliferation of rat and human T cells and their cytokine and chemokine secretion was suppressed by KIO100 (PP-001) in vitro (13, 15). Cytokine production of RPE cells, shown with primary human RPE cells and the human ARPE-19 cell line, was not affected by treatment with KIO-100 (PP-001) (15).\nFIGURE 6 Optical coherence tomography (OCT) images.

In this case the initial size of CME spaces was much smaller, but after injection the CME has disappeared completely.\nFrontiers in Medicine 07 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 7 Visual field testing was performed at baseline, days 7 and 28. Mean deviation from normal is shown for each visit of all patients pooled from the three different dosing groups. All patients had loss of visual field sensitivity at baseline due to pre-existing destruction of previous chronic uveitis. In the follow up were no additional losses of more the 2 dB in a single patient. At day 28 the average visual field sensitivity had increased slightly, probably in part by training effects.\nThe therapeutic potency of intraocular KIO-100 (PP-001) on uveitis was previously investigated in a spontaneously relapsing rat model of EAU (15). Therapeutic injection of KIO100 (PP-001) was performed in diseased rat eyes after the first course of intraocular inflammation to prevent further relapses. Although the retinal concentration of KIO-100 (PP-001) rapidly and massively decreased within the first 8 h to about 30% of the injected dose, further dropped to about 5% after 12 h and was below the detection limit after 4 days, we observed a significant suppression of the frequency of relapses and their intensity within the first 6 days after injection (15). We hypothesized that the activation of intraocular T cells present in the eye at the time of the intravitreal injection was hampered by KIO-100 (PP-001) and T cells were therefore unable to recruit inflammatory cells to induce a relapse.\nIn this prospective, open labeled, controlled clinical trial the substance KIO-100 (PP-001) was administered to humans for the first time. The route of administration was once intravitreal with 3 different doses of 0.3, 0.6, and 1.2 \u00b5g. Side effects, deemed by investigators as not clinically meaningful, occurred with the surgical procedure including a single incidence of transiently increased intraocular pressure and conjunctival bleedings or conjunctival hyperemia.\nThe primary goal of this study was to demonstrate safety and tolerability of intravitreal injections of KIO-100 (PP-001). Basically, all measurements and clinical observations served this aspect. In none of the cases we observed any drug-related ocular\nside effect. Since the amount of the injected study drug was very low the systemic exposure in the peripheral blood was below the quantification level of the assay. We could neither detect any systemic nor ocular toxicity. In summary, all safety measures demonstrated KIO-100 (PP-001) to be safe at the tested doses within the observation period of 4 weeks.\nAlthough the study design and patient selection were targeted at detecting ocular or systemic side effects and not at anti-inflammatory, therapeutic effects, we could observe a clinical improvement in the two groups receiving the higher doses, in which visual acuity increased 14 days after injection. This improvement was significant and still observed after 28 days in the highest dose group. Also, classical signs of inflammatory activity like anterior chamber cells and vitreal haze were reduced in the two higher dose groups demonstrating a potential positive effect on uveitis. However, since this study aimed at assessing safety of the study drug the patients assigned to the different dose groups differed with respect of diagnoses and disease intensities, which might have influenced the outcome of the three treatment groups.\nThe frequency of the relapses in rat EAU is much higher than in human uveitis, which might explain that the latency for recurrences of 6 days observed in rats was extended to at least 4 weeks without recurrent inflammation in patients. The observation period of this study ended 28 days after injection, therefore no data are available beyond this point. All rat eyes were investigated histologically after the termination of these experiments, and no alterations except for the usual signs of inflammation-induced retinal destruction from uveitis had been observed in both, the KIO-100 (PP-001) and the vehicletreated groups.\nIntraocular application of therapeutic drugs can avoid potential systemic side effects and will only affect the autoreactive cells in the target organ of the disease. The only presently available intraocular therapeutics for uveitis are corticosteroids, which can be introduced with sustained-release carriers and therapeutic effects between 4 months and some years. However, corticosteroids can have side effects in the eye, including cataract development and glaucoma (22). Due to the single application and the short half-life of KIO-100 (PP-001) we could not observe such adverse events within the 4 weeks observation time, especially no elevated intraocular pressure pointing to glaucoma development.\nThe effect of intraocular KIO-100 (PP-001) on signs of inflammation like cells and haze in the vitreous was visible only after 7\u201314 days, which points to suppressed T cell activation rather than to an immediate anti-inflammatory effect. This is in coincidence with previous in vitro data of peripheral blood lymphocytes from human donors showing that KIO-100 (PP001) suppresses proliferation of lymphocytes and their cytokine secretion, but has no effect on the secretion of monokines, which suggests that monocytes/macrophages are not affected by DHODH inhibition (15).\nFrontiers in Medicine 08 frontiersin.org\nAlso, in the groups receiving higher doses, in 2 of 5 patients their pre-existing CME resolved transiently, associated with a decrease in central retinal thickness. Although in one patient the CME had previously been therapy-refractive and had not responded to systemic or intravitreal steroids including dexamethasone slow releasing devices, we could observe a regression of the edema after injection of KIO-100 (PP-001). Macular edema as a complication of uveitis accounts for about 40% of cases with visual impairment (23). Mast cells have been found in the uveal tract and are described to play a role in macular edema fostering leakage of blood vessels (24\u201330). DHODH-inhibition was shown to induce apoptosis in mast cells (31), which might explain the positive effect of KIO-100 (PP-001) on increased retinal thickness and macular edema, respectively, in addition to the suppression of T cells that fuel the inflammation by the activation of innate immune cells.\nThe T cell type responsible for the induction and maintenance of uveitis is not yet completely clear. In experimental mouse models an important role of Th1 and Th17 type cells for the pathogenicity was postulated (6, 32), which has led to the initiation of clinical trials targeting IL-17. Those trials had not been successful so far (33), explained by the fact that T helper cells and especially Th17 cells are not restricted to the production of one cytokine, but are producing a cocktail of different cytokines which are tuning their function (5, 34).\nIn our rat models of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) we have shown that both, Th1 and Th17 cells, are differently expresses in diseased eyes depending on the type of uveitis. In a spontaneous relapsing-remitting rat model induced by immunization with R14, a peptide from interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein IRBP and adjuvant Th17 cells are obviously necessary to guide autoreactive T cells to the eye, since they are mainly found in the eyes at onset of the first attack of uveitis, which is suggesting a function in facilitating invasion of inflammatory cells. In the later course of EAU and especially during relapses Th1 cells are dominating (5, 35). The role of Th1 cells and their lead cytokine IFN-\u03b3 was further demonstrated by the induction of synchronized relapses after intraocular injection of IFN-\u03b3. The other model, induced with retinal S-antigen peptide PDSAg, displays only one clinically visible inflammatory attack, which is then followed by chorioretinal neovascularization as a late sequel. This is caused by the VEGF secretion of the autoreactive, PDSAg-specific T cells, a rarely described feature of T lymphocytes (13, 36). This type of uveitis is initiated by an early intraocular invasion of predominantly Th1 cells, while Th17 cells are increasing at the resolution of inflammation, probably playing an important role as regulatory cells, since they are co-expressing IL-10. In our rat models we could demonstrate that the T cell populations within the eyes during uveitis are highly dynamic, they change their phenotype by co-expressing IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17, even together with IL10, indicating that they might convert to Tregs, since the IFN\u03b3/IL-17/IL-10 co-expressing cells increase at the resolution of\nthe monophasic disease and decrease during the course of the relapsing uveitis. In late remission of the monophasic EAU the Foxp3+ Treg population is higher than in the eyes of rats with relapsing-remitting disease. This shift of T cell populations is only observed in the eyes, but not in the lymph nodes of the same animals (5). In human non-infectious uveitis, where only peripheral blood is available for investigation, Th17 cells were rather found to facilitate ocular invasion of inflammatory cells and later converting to T regs than driving the autoimmune response (37\u201339).\nThese points to the fact that within the tissue affected by the autoimmune disease T cell populations undergo changes of phenotype and potentially of their function that is not reflected by peripheral lymphocyte populations. That is, why local targeting of autoreactive T cells, here by injecting therapeutic drugs into the eyes, might have a different effect on the T cells and thus on the disease than just systemic treatment, suppressing the activity of the tissue-invading lymphocytes (5). When rats are concomitantly immunized with both antigens, the monophasic disease phenotype dominates, and the intraocular IL-10+ and Foxp3+ T cell populations correspond to the populations detected in the monophasic, PDSAg-induced disease, irrespective of whether the animals were immunized with a mixture or both antigens separately in contralateral legs (40). Interestingly, in both rat models, irrespective of a relapsing or monophasic course, green fluorescent protein (GFP) + autoreactive T cells can still be detected within the retinal tissue even weeks after resolution of intraocular inflammation (40). Those cells form clusters during spontaneous relapses, suggesting intraretinal expansion of the remaining autoreactive T cells. They might be a reservoir for recurrences or fuel subclinical inflammation, and moreover, they seem to attract newly invading T cells (40). Those cells would be targeted by intraocular, T cell suppressing treatment as proposed and tested here in this clinical phase 1 trial.\nThe role of B cells that also can be targeted by KIO-100 (PP-001) in uveitis is not yet clear, it varies from promoting T cell activity and its function as antigen-presenting cells to regulation by their production of IL-10 and IL-35 (41\u201344). In rare cases of therapy-refractive juvenile uveitis or uveitis accompanying multiple sclerosis targeting B cells has shown some effect (45\u201348). Nevertheless, since inhibition of DHODH also impedes B cell activation, the therapeutic effect of KIO-100 (PP-001) exceeds an exclusive T cell suppression as gained by the presently approved therapies for uveitis, ciclosporin A and TNF-blocker Adalimumab (2).\nThe effect of intraocular KIO-100 (PP-001) is primarily the suppression of T cell activation, which is in coincidence with previous in vitro data of peripheral blood lymphocytes from human donors showing that KIO-100 (PP-001) suppresses proliferation of lymphocytes and their cytokine secretion, but has no effect on the secretion of monokines, suggesting\nFrontiers in Medicine 09 frontiersin.org\nthat monocytes/macrophages are not affected by DHODH inhibition (15).\nThe number of patients in this first clinical trial of KIO-100 (PP-001) in humans was limited by design, and therefore too small to attribute certain positive effects to a clinical diagnosis or disease activity. To answer those questions further studies aiming at clinical efficacy are required to fully explore the potential of the small molecule DHODH inhibitor in the treatment of inflammatory eye disease and cystoid macular edema."
