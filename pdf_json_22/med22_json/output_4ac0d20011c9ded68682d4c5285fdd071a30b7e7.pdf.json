The feeding situation at 10\ndays, 42 days, 3 months, and 6 months after birth were investigated. A self-designed\nbreastfeeding questionnaire was used for investigation and follow-up. SPSS 22.0 was\napplied for statistical analysis of the data.\nResults: The exclusive breastfeeding rate of full-term infants on days 10 and 42\nand at months three and six after birth was 61.38%, 54.78%, 48.83%, and 38.78%,\nrespectively, with a decreasing trend over time. During breastfeeding within 48 h after\ndelivery, 1,653 cases (91.83%) of puerpera had different grades of pain, including\n1,325 cases (80.16%) of mild discomfort, 321 cases (19.42%) of moderate pain,\nand seven cases (0.42%) of severe pain. Within 24\u201348 h postpartum, 1,607 (89.27%)\nmothers faced problems related to postpartum breastfeeding. Among them, 694\n(43,19%) neonates could not be fed effectively; 665 (41.38%) mothers had wound\npain and had inconvenience to turn over; 598 (37.21%) neonates were difficult to\nwake up; 439 (27.32%) mothers had incorrect feeding posture; 181 (11.26%) mothers\nexperienced other problems. The Cox risk regression model showed that weight gain\nduring pregnancy was higher than the recommended standard. Living in suburban\ncounties was a risk factor of exclusive breastfeeding for full-term infants. Participation\nin breastfeeding courses during pregnancy, feeding more than eight times daily after\ndelivery, were the protective factors of exclusive breastfeeding for full-term infants.\nConclusion: The body weight gain of parturients should be controlled within\na reasonable range during pregnancy. Parturients were encouraged by medical\nstaff to participate in breastfeeding courses or watch the breastfeeding process\nduring pregnancy to increase their self-confidence and improve the rate of exclusive\nbreastfeeding for full-term infants. In addition, it is necessary to strengthen the publicity\nof breastfeeding in suburban areas to promote breastfeeding.\nKeywords: Xi\u2019an, exclusive breastfeeding, influencing factors, body weight gain, full-term infants"

            "text": "The death of about two-thirds of children <5 years of age are caused by infections, and about 35% are related to malnutrition worldwide (1). In contrast, the death of only 21.4% of infants in 2008 in China was infection-related, of which pneumonia was 16.5%, diarrhea 3%, and neonatal septicemia 1.9% (2). However, child mortality is much higher in poor western provinces, and the incidence of mortality in children <5 years of age in the poorest areas is more than six times that in large cities (3). Breastfeeding has been demonstrated to reduce the occurrence and mortality of infants due to infection and reduce the risk of being overweight and obese (4). The World Health Organization recommended that exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) last 6 months and beginning complementary feeding at 6 months with continued breastfeeding up to 2 years and beyond (5). The \u201cChildren\u2019s Development Program 2011\u20132020 in China\u201d sets a goal that the rate of EBF of infants from 0 to 6 months should be over 50% (6). Approximately 48% of infants start breastfeeding within the first hour after birth worldwide, excluding China. The statistical data from 2014 to 2020 showed that 44% of infants between 0 and 5 months old had EBF, including China (7).\nThe rate of EBF in China within 6 months varies among different regions. Although it shows an increasing trend, rate is still lower than 50%. In 2010, a survey of 2,354 babies in 12 provinces (including Shanxi) in the central and western regions of China showed that only 28.7% of the infants received EBF within 6 months postpartum (8). A survey of 976 pregnant women in Nanchang, a city in the central region of China, from 2011 to 2013 showed that the rates of EBF were 36.0% and 34.5% at 1 and 6 months postpartum (9). In 2012, a postpartum feeding survey of 528 women in 9 counties in Zhejiang Province showed that the rate of EBF for babies at 6 months was 30.3% (10). In 2014, the EBF rate of infants in Changsha, a city in the central region of China, during hospitalization was 37.5%, and that of infants at 6 months after discharge was 40.0% (11). In 2019, a survey of 5,302 children in Zhongshan, a city in the southern region of China, showed that the EBF rate at 6 months was 42.03% (12). Lu et al. investigated the feeding status of 1,193 infants and young children in rural areas of Gansu Province from November 2018 to January 2019, and showed that the EBF rate within 6 months was 39.02% (13). Hence, breastfeeding may reduce the occurrence and mortality of pediatric infectious diseases in western China by promoting good infant and child feeding practices, particularly preventing inappropriate use of breastmilk substitutes. In addition, infant feeding habits may\nbe related to the long-term incidence of non-communicable diseases (3). Most provinces in China has extend maternity leave by 60 days in addition to the 98 days stipulated by the state. Among them, the maternity leave in Shaanxi was extended to 158 days, and for those undergoing pre-pregnancy check-ups, it was extended to 168 days. These changes may support EBF in women from this area (14).\nTherefore, this study was designed to investigate the current breastfeeding situation of full-term infants within 6 months in Xi\u2019an and analyze its influencing factors to provide a basis for establishing breastfeeding measures and improving infant feeding in clinical practice."

According to the number of delivery cases of the hospitals in 2018, one provincial-level maternal and child health hospital, three municipal hospitals, and one county-level maternal and child health hospital were selected. The sample size of each hospital was calculated based on the proportion of the number of delivery cases of this hospital in all selected ones.\nThe full-term infants born from January 1, 2019, to February 28, 2019, and their mothers were selected as subjects at five hospitals in Xi\u2019an, including one provincial hospital, three municipal hospitals, and one county hospital. All 5 hospitals are baby-friendly hospitals. The outpatient health education includes training sessions for pregnant women, such as the structure of breasts in different periods, breastfeeding, the process of natural childbirth, etc. After being admitted to the hospital, pregnant women were instructed with breastfeeding knowledge by the nurses. The Early Essential Newborn Care is implemented immediately after the baby is born in the delivery room. In 2 hospitals (1 at the municipal level and 1 at the county level), babies were placed on the mothers\u2019 abdomen after born and the skin contact time was no <90min after the baby was born. In 3 hospitals (1 at the provincial level, 2 at the municipal level), the skin contact time was no <30min.

After returning to the ward, mothers were instructed with breastfeeding practice guidance by nurses in a \u201cone-on-one\u201d mode. In cases with cesarean section, mothers returned to the ward, and skin contact and sucking were immediately carried out. All hospitals implemented 24-h rooming with mothers and babies. Breastfeeding consultations were provided through follow-up visits and telephone calls for 1 week after discharge.\nA self-designed breastfeeding questionnaire and follow-up questionnaire were used for investigation. Eighteen hundred questionnaires with complete information were collected, all of which were continuous cases.\nInclusion criteria: \u2460 Single-fetus full-term infants with a gestational age of at least 37 weeks; \u2461 their parents were married and voluntarily participated in the breastfeeding investigation and were willing to cooperate with the investigators.\nExclusion criteria: \u2460 Twins, or singles with a gestational age <37 weeks; \u2461 their parents were unwilling to participate in the investigation; \u2462 mothers with infectious diseases such as HBV, HCV, etc.; \u2463 pregnant women participating in other studies."

Before the study, a one-month pre-survey was performed in the provincial hospital from November to December 2018, and four rounds of revision of the questionnaire were completed by the chief nurses and investigators of the ward who participated in this study. The final version of the revised questionnaire was then used. The questionnaire was divided into two parts. The first part was an investigation of general information using the Breastfeeding Questionnaire, which included demographic characteristics (residence, education, family income, occupation, etc.), pregnancy (sleep during pregnancy, BMI, complications, etc.), and breastfeeding-related investigations. The second part was the follow-up investigation of newborns from birth to 6 months.\nA total of 2,520 full-term infants were included in this study and 1,800 cases were followed for 6 months (Figure 1). The questionnaire recovery rate was 71.43%.

A summary analysis of breastfeeding rates in China from 2007 to 2018 reported that in Xi\u2019an, the EBF rates of 3,580 infants at 1, 3, and 6 months were 76.51%, 47.09%, and 16.31%, respectively (19). China\u2019s breastfeeding data (UNICEF data, 2012\u20132014) showed that the EBF rate within 6 months was 28%, which has not increased in the past 3 years (20\u201322). In recent years, with the publicity and promotion of breastfeeding knowledge in baby-friendly hospitals and the extension of maternity leave, more parturients have joined in the learning and practice of breastfeeding knowledge, and the rate of EBF has continuously increased. This study showed that the EBF rate of full-term infants within 3 and 6 months was 48.83% and 38.78%, which was higher than the reported data and might be related to the selection of full-term infants in this study.

For this reason, breastfeeding instruction should be provided to parturients throughout the postnatal period until they are comfortable and keep breastfeeding. For example, after delivery, attention should be paid to the parturients\u2019 different degrees of lactation pain and take corresponding measures to reduce pain and the incidences of postpartum cracked nipples, prolonging the lactation time. Concern should be given to the initiation time of parturients lactation in the early postpartum period, starting\nFrontiers in Pediatrics | www.frontiersin.org 7 March 2022 | Volume 9 | Article 801436\nTABLE 6 | Cox proportional hazard model.\nIndependent variable \u03b2 S.E Wald P HR 95% CI\nLower limit Upper limit\nWeight gain during pregnancy conforming to the standard 1 1 1 1 1\n< standard 0.015 0.076 0.037 0.847 1.015 0.874 1.178\n> standard 0.171 0.073 5.436 0.020 1.186 1.028 1.369\nResident location 0.198 0.067 8.686 0.003 1.219 1.069 1.391\nBreastfeeding courses during pregnancy \u22120.308 0.070 19.318 0.000 0.735 0.641 0.843\nTimes of daily breastfeeding 48 h after delivery < 6 times 1 1 1 1 1\n6\u20138 times \u22120.16 0.068 3.451 0.063 0.881 0.771 1.007\nMore than 8 time \u22120.47 0.091 19.99 0.000 0.665 0.557 0.796\nlactation as early as possible through the effective sucking of the infant to ensure the lactation amount was conducive to promoting breastfeeding.\nThe results of this study showed that when the parturients\u2019 weight gains during pregnancy with different BMI ranges before pregnancy were higher than the recommended standards, the risk of non-EBF within 6 months after delivery was 1.186 times higher than those with weight gains meeting the recommended standards. Huang (25) found that excessive weight gain during pregnancy increased the risk of premature termination of breastfeeding, and the risk of delayed lactation initiation for parturients with excessive weight gain increased by 10%. Huang et al. (26) conducted a systematic evaluation of the literature before February 2019. The results showed that pre-pregnancy obesity was a risk factor for breastfeeding initiation, EBF, and the duration of any breastfeeding. Excessive weight gain or obesity during pregnancy were risk factors for the duration of EBF. Therefore, women of childbearing age who were obese before pregnancy or had too much or not enough weight gain during pregnancy were significantly less likely to initiate breastfeeding and continue to breastfeed for the recommended duration. In a study of low-income women in the United States, Li et al. (27) found that the mother\u2019s pre-pregnancy BMI, being overweight or obese, and pregnancy weight gain were independent factors affecting the length of breastfeeding; there was no correlation between them. Hilson et al. (28) found no correlation between pre-pregnant BMI andGWGon EBF and breastfeeding in a study of 2,783 breastfeeding women in the United States. In this study, there was still no correlation between pre-pregnancy BMI and GWG. Weight management is an essential part of health care during pregnancy. Therefore, proper weight control of women of childbearing age and keeping their weight gain within the normal range during pregnancy can promote EBF and prolong the breastfeeding time.\nSince the \u201ctwo-child policy,\u201d the state has advocated breastfeeding to reduce infant mortality and improve infant health conditions. The latest study shows that the infantmortality rate (<1 years-old/thousand) in rural areas is more than twice that in urban areas (29). Other studies have also shown that the growth of infants and children in rural areas lags behind that in urban areas, and poor infant feeding practices, including\ninadequate breastfeeding, are prevalent in these areas (30\u201333). In this study, the EBF rate was 44.89% within 6 months for urban areas and 29.03% for suburban counties (P = 0.00), with a statistically significant difference. Due to the imbalance in economic and educational development between cities and suburban counties, the difference in the acceptance and execution of the concept of feeding among the population, and the publicity of various milk powder advertisements, the belief in EBF is easily shaken, thus reducing the rate of EBF in suburban counties. Therefore, it is necessary to take appropriate intervention measures to improve the knowledge and practices of parturients and family members on breastfeeding in suburban areas to increase the rate of EBF and prolong breastfeeding time.\nThis study mainly investigated the EBF rate of full-term infants within 6 months in the Xi\u2019an area and analyzed its influencing factors to provide the basis for the clinical designation of targeted measures. However, during the research, due to the adjustment of obstetrics work mode in some hospitals, the final collected data was less than the planned cases. After the unqualified samples were excluded, the qualified samples were fewer. A total of 326 parturients were lost within the 6-month follow-up period with a rate of 12.9%. Most parturients were lost to follow-up in the sixth month, which might be related to the decrease of parturients\u2019 cooperation with a prolonged study. The above two points may limit the outcome of this study."

            "text": "Our work fills the gap in the rate of exclusive breastfeeding for full-term infants in Xi\u2019an, China. This study showed that the EBF rates in Xi\u2019an at 10 days, 42 days, 3 months, and 6 months after birth were 61.39%, 54.78%, 48.83%, and 38.78%, respectively. There is a downward trend over time. Although the EBF rate within 6 months has increased compared with previous reported data, there is still a gap with the WHO\u2019s target of 50% within 6 months. Our study also found that weight gain during pregnancy higher than the recommended standard, and living in a suburban county was a risk factor for mothers to terminate exclusive breastfeeding within 6 months after delivery, while taking breastfeeding courses during pregnancy, and the number of breastfeeds per\nFrontiers in Pediatrics | www.frontiersin.org 8 March 2022 | Volume 9 | Article 801436\nday within 48 hours after delivery was >8 were the factors contributing to continuous EBF for 6 months postpartum. With the changes in people\u2019s eating habits and dietary structure, excessive intake of fats and oils during pregnancy may lead to excessive weight gain and excessive weight gain, and may cause early termination of EBF after delivery. Wang et al. investigated postpartum lactation in 240 parturients and found that high BMI and high GWG before pregnancy are risk factors for delayed lactation initiation. Primiparas were more prone to delayed onset of lactogenesis (34). It has also been shown that the breastfeeding rate of women with high prepregnancy BMI and excessive weight gain during pregnancy decreased the breastfeeding rate of women (35). In addition, excessive weight gain during pregnancy also increases the risk of pregnant women developing gestational diabetes (36). Therefore, weight control during pregnancy is a key. After delivery, early breastfeeding (early contact, early sucking, early milking) should be recommended to promote the initiation of the second stage of lactation. More attention should be paid on mothers facing breastfeeding problems. In addition, by using community medical resources, publicity of breastfeeding for pregnant women in suburbs and counties should be recommended. Future investigations are needed to explore the effects of the spouses and other family members in breastfeeding to establish a family-style breastfeeding support system should be established."
