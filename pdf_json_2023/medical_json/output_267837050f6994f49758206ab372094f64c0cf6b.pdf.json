    "abstractText": "The Hulong hybrid grouper was bred from the brown-marbled grouper (Epinephelus fuscoguttatus) \u2640 and the giant grouper (E. lanceolatus) \u2642, combining the advantageous traits of both parents. Possessing an excellent performance, this hybrid\u2019s cultivation promotes the development of the grouper industry. Its male parent, the giant grouper, possesses the fastest growth and the largest body size among all coral-reef-dwelling fish. This species is not only an economically important species in marine aquaculture, but it is also an ideal male parent in the interspecific crossing of grouper species. In the present study, a high-quality chromosome-level genome of the giant grouper was constructed with a total length of 1.06 Gb, consisting of 24 chromosomes and 69 scaffolds. To analyze the genetic differences between the parents of the Hulong hybrid grouper, the structural variations (SVs) between both parental genomes were detected, and a total of 46,643 SVs were obtained. Highquality SNPs were identified from resequencing data. There were significant differences between the two genomes, and the average FST reached 0.685. A total of 234 highly differentiated regions were detected with an FST > 0.9. The protein-coding genes involved in SVs and highly differentiated regions were significantly enriched in metabolic pathways, including fatty metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism and the TCA cycle. These genes may be related to the differences in feeding preferences and the ability to digest carbohydrates between the two grouper species under natural conditions. In addition, protein-coding genes related to the cell cycle and p53-signaling pathway were also detected. These genes may play important roles in the regulation of body size and growth performance. This research provides genomic resources for further breeding works and evolutionary analyses.",

Groupers include more than 160 species in 16 genera [1], and, among them, approximately 47 grouper species have been cultured [2]. Groupers are popular in the markets of South and Southeast Asia due to their high nutrient value, tender meat and delicious taste. Due to the incomplete reproductive isolation and various grouper species, crossbreeding is the most common tool in the breeding of groupers, and many new hybrids have been obtained by means of artificial\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 12007. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms241512007 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 12007 2 of 13\ninsemination. Among the hybrids, brown-marbled grouper (Epinephelus fuscoguttatus) \u2640\u00d7 giant grouper (E. lanceolatus) \u2642is the most successful hybrid grouper. It possesses an excellent growth performance and strong stress resistance, and it greatly promotes the development of the grouper industry [3]. At present, the annual output of this hybrid accounts for more than 70% of the grouper market in China [4]. The giant grouper is the male parent of the Hulong hybrid grouper, and it is the largest grouper species in the world. Its length can reach 2.7 m and its weight can reach 400 kg [5]. The giant grouper has been widely applied as the male parent in other interspecific crossings of grouper species due to its excellent growth traits. To date, at least five hybrids, including kelp grouper (E. moara) \u2640\u00d7 giant grouper \u2642 [6], orange-spotted grouper (E. coioides) \u2640\u00d7 giant grouper \u2642 [7], brown-marbled grouper \u2640\u00d7 giant grouper \u2642 [8], humpback grouper (Cromileptes altivelis) \u2640\u00d7 giant grouper \u2642 [9] and red-spotted grouper (E. akaara) \u2640\u00d7 giant grouper \u2642 [10], have been reported. The growth traits of these hybrid groupers are all significantly higher than those of their female parents. Obviously, the genome of the giant grouper plays an important role in the growth advantage of hybrid groupers. The giant grouper and brown-marbled grouper are the parents of the Hulong hybrid grouper; however, there are significant differences in their sizes: the brown-marbled grouper weighs 4~12 kg, while the giant grouper can reach 400 kg. Analyses of the growth difference between the two grouper species contribute to understanding the genetic basis for growth advantages in giant groupers. Recent research reported some genetic analyses of the brown-marbled grouper and the giant grouper; high levels of genome synteny were revealed, and their divergence time was 10.49\u201322.50 Myr, which are considered pivotal factors for the success of hybrid groupers [11]. An F2 segregation population of the Hulong hybrid grouper was applied to analyze the genetic basis of the growth advantage, and several genes involved in energy metabolism, development, stress tolerance, the immune response and visual perception were found to be associated with growth traits in the juvenile stage of the giant grouper [12]. In order to provide useful genetic information for the conservation and breeding of the giant grouper, a high-quality chromosome-level genome is essential. Although two genomes of the giant grouper have been assembled recently [4,13], there were some flaws in them. For Zhou et al.\u2019s assembled genome, they only applied Illumina sequencing data, the contig N50 value was only 119.9 kb and the number of assembled scaffolds was 4207. The numerous gaps and fragments in the giant grouper genome destroy the integrity and lower the correctness of the genome, and hamper efforts at locating trait-related genes and markers. In Wang et al.\u2019s assembled genome, the pseudochromosomes of the giant grouper were constructed based on the genetic linkage map of another grouper (orange-spotted grouper), where only 39.41% and 88.62% of the scaffolds and bases, respectively, could be anchored to pseudochromosomes. Thus, the genome of the giant grouper needs to be further improved. In the present study, first, we assembled a high-quality chromosome-level giant grouper genome using the PacBio platform and Hi-C technology, and we predicted the gene structures; second, genomic differences between the giant grouper and the brown-marbled grouper were detected. These genetic differences were related to feeding preferences, the ability to digest carbohydrates and the cell cycle. This research provides a better genome and insights into the genetic differentiation between the brown-marbled grouper and giant grouper."

Discussion The giant grouper is the largest coral-reef-dwelling fish, and it has been widely used for crossbreeding as the male parent. The Hulong hybrid grouper is one of the most successful hybrids, bred from the brown-marbled grouper and giant grouper. It shows the advantageous traits of both parents, and it greatly promotes the development of the grouper industry. Here, a high-quality chromosome-level genome of the giant grouper was assembled, and the genomic differences between the parents of the Hulong hybrid grouper were analyzed.\n3.1. Genome Assembly and Evolution Analyses The chromosomal genome of the giant grouper was constructed using Illumina and PacBio sequencing and Hi-C technology. The assembled genome is 1.06 Gb in length, which is slightly smaller than Wang\u2019s result (1.128 Gb) [4] and Zhou\u2019s result (1.08 Gb) [13]. Compared to the other two published genomes, the new genome showed a higher quality [4,13]. For example, the contig length N50 of the new genome (24.33 Mb) is far higher than those of the other two genomes (119.9 kb and 1469.4 kb, respectively); the contig number of the new genome (170) is far less than those of the other two genomes (27,630 and 3207,\nFigure 4. anhattan plot of FST values of SNPs b twee iant g ouper and brown-ma bled grouper genomes.\nInt.

            "text": "Through interspecific collinearity analysis, a significant genome synteny between the brown-marbled grouper and giant grouper was observed, while the divergence time was relatively late [11], and lots of SVs between the brown-marbled grouper and giant grouper genomes were detected. Variations were mainly distributed in introns and intergenic regions, but numerous repeat mutations were located in exons. Recent reports have shown that repeats are closely related to gene expression. For example, thousands of repeats showing regulatory effects for protein-coding genes were identified and demonstrated in Caenorhabditis elegans [15]. A repeat mutation located in the cold-induced autoinflammatory syndrome 1 (CIAS1) gene was associated with hypertension [16]. From our results, the protein-coding genes involved in repeat mutations were found to be involved in multiple metabolic pathways, including lipid metabolism (glycerophospholipid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism and biosynthesis), amino acid metabolism (histidine, glutamate, alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism), glycometabolism (insulin secretion, fructose and mannose metabolism, N-glycan metabolism) and the TCA cycle. These pathways are crucial to cellular and organismal homeostasis and play important roles in energy utilization and storage and signal transduction. Fatty acids, amino acids and carbohydrates are necessary energy substances for animals, and differences in the metabolisms between the two species may result in different levels of efficiency in the assimilation of energy. The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is a critical route for oxidative phosphorylation, which is the main source of cellular energy and participates in many metabolic pathways in organisms [17]. The mutations may influence the efficiency of ATP production. Glycerophospholipids are the most abundant phospholipids in the body, and they not only constitute biological membranes, but are also components of bile and membrane surfactants. The participation of glycerophospholipids in membrane protein recognition and signal transduction is associated with many traits and diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, neurological diseases, fatty liver and stress resistance [18]. These variations in genome sequences may give rise to differences in multiple phenotypes."

            "text": "Recent research has shown that the divergence time of E. lanceolatus and E. fuscoguttatus is 10.49\u201322.50 Myr, and their genomes possessed a significant synteny [11]. However, there was a significant differentiation between the two genomes based on SNPs: the average FST reached 0.685. The regions with an FST > 0.9 were considered as demonstrating high genetic differentiation, and a total of 234 regions and 981 protein-coding genes were detected of this type. Based on the KEGG analysis, these genes were enriched in starch and sucrose metabolism, fructose and mannose metabolism, galactose metabolism, the TCA cycle, pyruvate metabolism, the insulin-signaling pathway, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and the AMPK-signaling pathway. Numerous SNPs were located in genes related to carbohydrate metabolism. These SNPs may relate to the differences in feeding preferences and the ability to digest carbohydrates between the two grouper species under natural conditions. In a recent study, researchers explored the genetic basis of species differentiation between wolves and dogs, and they mentioned that key genes in the starch\u2013sucrose-\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 12007 8 of 13\nmetabolism pathway and fat-metabolism pathway of dogs were selected to adapt to starchbased grain food in order to adapt to the farming environment of human beings in the process of evolution or domestication [19]. These genetic differences in glucose metabolism will be an important resource in future breeding works, which will be used to improve multiple production traits, such as growth, the artificial-feed-acclimation efficiency, the feed-conversion efficiency and the stocking density. Some protein-coding genes were related to the cell cycle and p53-signaling pathways, and these pathways are closely related to the regulation of the cell cycle and proliferation [20,21]. In teleost species, genes involved in pathways of the cell cycle and cell proliferation play important roles in the regulation of growth and development [22]. In rainbow trout, quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with bodyweight gain were detected using genome-wide association (GWA) analysis, and some genes involved in bodyweight gain were enriched in the cell cycle [23]. In broilers (Gallus gallus), researchers discovered that genes involved in the p53-signaling pathway are associated with the growth performance [24]. These genetic differences may be associated with the differences in body size between the brown-marbled grouper and giant grouper."

The fish was immediately dissected after anesthesia with MS-222. White dorsal muscle tissue was sampled and immediately stored in liquid nitrogen, which was used for genomic DNA sequencing and Hi-C library construction. Moreover, ten tissues, including skin, muscle, liver, kidney, brain, intestine, fat, spleen, heart and gill tissues, were collected, immersed in RNAlater\u2122 Stabilization Solution (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and then stored at \u221280 \u25e6C for RNA isolation. Total DNA was extracted from white muscle tissue with a TIANamp Marine Animals DNA Kit (Tiangen Biotech Co., Ltd., Beijing, China). The quality and quantity of the total DNA were determined via NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). A paired-end sequencing library with an insert length of 350 bp was constructed using a TruSeq Nano DNA LT Library Preparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). The obtained library was then sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq X Ten platform. Genome DNA was broken into fragments using Covaris and recycled using AMpure PB beads (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, USA). A SMRTbell library was constructed using the SMRTbell Template Prep Kit (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, and was sequenced using the PacBio Bioscience Sequel platform (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, USA). Muscle samples were fixed with fresh paraformaldehyde, and then DNA\u2013protein bonds were created. The Mbo I restriction enzyme was used to digest the DNA, and the overhanging 5\u2032 ends of the DNA fragments were repaired with a biotinylated residue. The fragments close to each other in the nucleus during fixation were ligated, and the denatured proteins were removed. The Hi-C fragments were further sheared via sonication, and then pulled down with streptavidin beads. The library was sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq X Ten platform with PE150. The total RNA of the 10 tissues (approximately 80 mg each) was extracted using RNAiso reagents (Takara, Dalian, China), following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The quantity and quality of the RNA samples were determined using a microplate spectrophotometer (BioTek Company, Winooski, VT, USA), and electrophoresis was conducted using 1% agarose gel. The total RNA of the 10 tissues was mixed at equal amounts to generate a mixed RNA pool. RNA-seq libraries were prepared using the NEBNext UltraTM RNA Library Prep Kit (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA), following the manufacturer\u2019s protocols. The libraries\u2019 qualities and quantities were measured using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).

For the PacBio-sequencing data, after removing short polymerase reads (less than 500 bp) and reads with a barcode adapter, clean data were corrected and primarily assembled using Canu version 1.8 [27]. Wtdbg was used to assemble the genome by constructing a fuzzy Bruijn graph https://github.com/ruanjue/wtdbg (accessed on 31 July 2021).

The TEs were classified and annotated using PASTEClassifier version 1.0 using the TEdenovo pipeline [39]. Coding sequences were removed from the predicted repeat sequences through alignment to the SwissProt database using blastx with an e-value < 1 \u00d7 10\u22124, identity > 30, coverage > 30% and length > 90 bp.
