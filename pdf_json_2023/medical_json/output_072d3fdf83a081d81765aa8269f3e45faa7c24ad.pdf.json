    "abstractText": "Background Frailty is associated with mortality among older adults. We aimed to determine the appropriate time and frailty index (FI) threshold for frailty intervention in Chinese community-dwelling older adults. Methods In this prospective cohort study, we used data from the 2011 wave of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Study. Follow-up was performed for seven years from baseline. Using the FI to evaluate frailty and define frailty status, we explored the best time point and FI score for frailty intervention, by comparing the relationships of FI and frailty status with mortality. Results From 2011 to 2018, 8642 participants were included and followed-up. A total of 4458 participants died during the study period. After adjusting for variables such as age, sex, marital status, education level, and living conditions, the hazard ratio (HR) of mortality risk based on the FI at baseline was 37.484 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 30.217\u201346.498; P < 0.001); female sex, living in the city, being married, and living with spouse were found to be protective factors, whereas ageing was a risk factor for frailty. The mortality risk was higher in pre-frail than in frail participants (HR: 3.588, 95% CI: 3.212\u20134.009, P < 0.001). Piecewise linear regression analysis revealed an FI score threshold of 0.5. When the FI score was > 0.5, the HR of mortality based on the FI was 15.758 (95% CI: 3.656\u201367.924; P < 0.001); when the FI score was \u2264 0.5, the HR of mortality based on the FI was 48.944 (95% CI: 36.162\u201366.244; P < 0.001). Conclusion Using FI as a continuous variable to predict death is more accurate than frailty status. The advancement of early interventions for mortality risk reduction is more beneficial in pre-frail than in frail patients, and an FI score of 0.5 was found to be the threshold for mortality prediction using the FI.",

Follow-up was performed for seven years from baseline. Using the FI to evaluate frailty and define frailty status, we explored the best time point and FI score for frailty intervention, by comparing the relationships of FI and frailty status with mortality.\nResults From 2011 to 2018, 8642 participants were included and followed-up. A total of 4458 participants died during the study period. After adjusting for variables such as age, sex, marital status, education level, and living conditions, the hazard ratio (HR) of mortality risk based on the FI at baseline was 37.484 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 30.217\u201346.498; P < 0.001); female sex, living in the city, being married, and living with spouse were found to be protective factors, whereas ageing was a risk factor for frailty. The mortality risk was higher in pre-frail than in frail participants (HR: 3.588, 95% CI: 3.212\u20134.009, P < 0.001). Piecewise linear regression analysis revealed an FI score threshold of 0.5. When the FI score was > 0.5, the HR of mortality based on the FI was 15.758 (95% CI: 3.656\u201367.924; P < 0.001); when the FI score was \u2264 0.5, the HR of mortality based on the FI was 48.944 (95% CI: 36.162\u201366.244; P < 0.001). Conclusion Using FI as a continuous variable to predict death is more accurate than frailty status. The advancement of early interventions for mortality risk reduction is more beneficial in pre-frail than in frail patients, and an FI score of 0.5 was found to be the threshold for mortality prediction using the FI.\nKeywords Frailty, Mortality, Prediction, Prevention, Older adults"

Frailty is becoming an increasingly obvious and common feature of an ageing older adults; a decline in various physiological functions related to age increases vulnerability to stressors. In addition to disease or disability, frailty is associated with a systemic impairment of physical and cognitive functions, including symptoms, diseases, and life-long deficits [3, 4].

FI is evaluated based on the concept that frailty is a state caused by a life-long accumulation of health deficits; the higher the number of health deficits, the greater the tendency for frailty. These health deficits include symptoms, disease, disability, abnormal laboratory findings, and social characteristics [10\u201312]. FI is predictive for adverse outcomes and is directly related to survival outcomes [13\u201315]. Moreover, compared with chronological age, FI has a stronger correlation with mortality, especially within short intervals less than four years [16].\nFI has been shown to vary with time; thus, it is evaluated using cross-sectional studies that cannot accurately predict mortality risk [17, 18]. Therefore, it is necessary to perform mortality risk reassessment using dynamic FI changes [19, 20]. Moreover, frailty is not only associated with age but is also affected by risk factors including impairment of activities of daily living, chronic diseases, depression, poor lifestyle habits, and geriatric syndromes [21, 22]. Effective prevention and treatment can reduce occurrence of frailty in older adults [23]. Hence, mortality risk prediction and early intervention to treat debilitating conditions can prolong survival time, thereby alleviating the pressure on medical care [24].\nWe aimed to collect and evaluate longitudinal data at different time points, and to accurately determine the best time point for frailty intervention using a long follow-up duration. Our findings will potentially enhance decision-making regarding frailty intervention and the effective utilization of medical resources."

The HR of mortality according to the FI was 2.209 (95% CI: 2.064\u20132.364, P < 0.001) when the frailty status was dichotomized.

However, the relationship between the frailty status and mortality risk has not been studied [31]. To examine the relationship of the FI and frailty status with survival time, we used Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curves to determine whether FI was more strongly associated with mortality than frailty status by calculating the AUCs, and to find that the frailty status was a weaker predictor than using FI with mortality. Previous studies have reported a correlation between FI and short-term mortality; furthermore, our findings demonstrated that FI can be used to predict the seven-year survival rate [21]. Impairment in activities of daily living, chronic diseases, depression, poor lifestyle habits, and geriatric syndromes are risk factors for frailty [32]. Similarly, our study revealed that female sex, living in a city, being married, and living with a spouse are predictive factors of frailty. This is probably attributed to the fact that marital status and living conditions of older adults are related to their mental health and access to medical resources [33]. Previous research had shown a relationship between frailty and type of death; hence, we used survival analysis to evaluate the association between FI and mortality. Our findings provide evidence that clinicians should perform frailty interventions to reduce preventable suffering before death; moreover, these interventions should be performed based on the known risk factors associated with FI [22].\nAbbreviations: CI Confidence interval,\u00a0FI_11\u00a0Frailty index in 2011, \u03b2\u00a0Regression coefficients, SE\u00a0Standard error, HR\u00a0Hazard Ratio\nAbbreviations: B\u00a0Regression coefficients, SE\u00a0Standard error, HR\u00a0Hazard Ratio,\u00a0CI Confidence interval\nNon-frailty/Frailty\nAge 0.061 0.002 1148.558 <0.001 1.062 1.059 1.066\nSex -0.464 0.036 167.825 <0.001 0.628 0.586 0.674\nEducation level -0.065 0.026 6.101 0.014 0.937 0.890 0.987\nMarital status -0.202 0.041 24.172 <0.001 0.817 0.754 0.885\nFrailty 0.792 0.035 525.386 <0.001 2.209 2.064 2.364\nRobust/Pre-frailty/Frailty\nAge 0.058 0.002 1077.900 <0.001 1.060 1.056 1.064\nSex -0.449 0.033 183.795 <0.001 0.638 0.598 0.681\nMarital status -0.182 0.041 19.724 <0.001 0.834 .769 0.903\nPre-Frailty 1.278 0.057 510.629 <0.001 3.588 3.212 4.009\nFrailty 0.599 0.053 126.720 <0.001 1.820 1.640 2.021\nAbbreviations: CI Confidence interval, FI_11\u00a0Frailty index in 2011, B\u00a0Regression coefficients, SE\u00a0Standard error, HR\u00a0Hazard Ratio\nWe further explored the relationship between the frailty status and mortality risk at baseline (2011) and during follow-up (2014 and 2018), to establish suitable frailty interventions [29]. When examining the frailtyrelated mortality risk, we adjusted for demographic (sex and age), and sociological (education level, marital status, and living conditions) factors. When the frailty status was divided into non-frailty and frailty, ageing was considered a risk factor while education level was found to be a protective factor for frailty, in addition to the female sex, being married, and living with spouse. This finding was probably because education increases health literacy. Furthermore, we found that the HR for mortality was higher in pre-frail than in frail individuals. When the FI is > 0.25 as frailty stage, it covers the fraction of FI > 0.5, and thus has less impact on death than pre-frailty stage when the FI is between 0.1 and 0.25. This provides evidence for the possibility of early intervention in pre-frail older adults.\nFrailty, defined by phenotype or FI, was found to be significantly associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality in community-dwelling Chinese older adults based on previous studies [34, 35]. Previous studies showed slightly different results of the relative mortality risk for different frailty levels owing to a lack of a unified frailty classification standard and inconsistencies in frailty status classification [36]. In the present study, we stratified the FI by grade rather than frailty categorization, to perform a more precise risk prediction, and confirm whether 0.5 was the FI threshold. The mortality risk increased with age, and the female sex and being married were found to be protective factors of frailty, which was consistent with previous study findings [37]. Living in the city was found to be a protective factor of frailty when the FI score was < 0.5, indicating that lifespan may be prolonged by exposure to advanced medications in the early state of frailty [38]. When the FI was > 0.5, the effect of frailty on mortality was relatively small because patients with the highest number of health deficits had the highest all-cause mortality rates [26]. A score of 0.5 was the risk threshold when the IF score was close to it, and the risk of death increased significantly with frailty under a score of 0.5."
