In recent years, multiple players behind these events have been characterized. Such is the case of AvrPto-dependent Pto-interacting protein 3 (Adi3), which has been linked to the regulation of cell death in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) plants exposed to Pseudomonas syringae (Pst) (Devarenne et al. 2006; Ek-Ramos et al. 2010).\nIn this issue of Plant Physiology, Yeo et al. (2023) aimed to study the dynamics of Adi3 phosphorylation in response to flagellin by western blot using a monoclonal antibody designed to recognize phosphorylated Adi3 (\u03b1-pAdi3). But, spoiler alert, this story is not about Adi3.\nOne of the most commons problems with the use of antibodies is the detection of off-targets, i.e. proteins that the antibody is not supposed to bind (Weller 2016). When performing western blot with \u03b1-pAdi3 in samples treated with flg22, a peptide derived from flagellin, a band of a lower molecular weight than that expected for Adi3, appeared in the soluble fraction. Given that Adi3 is not processed into small fragments and that it is detected in the insoluble fraction of leaf extracts (Ek-Ramos et al. 2010), the researchers suspected that the target of \u03b1-pAdi3 antibody was another protein. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry revealed that the mysterious protein was threonine deaminase 2 (TD2). The identity of the protein was further confirmed by comparison using an \u03b1-TD2-specific antibody. Both antibodies were able to recognize recombinant TD2 produced in Escherichia coli and endogenous \u03b1-TD2-immunoprecipitated TD2. Furthermore, when leaf extracts were obtained from a td2 knockout line, none of the antibodies gave a positive signal. Thus, the target of \u03b1-pAdi3 was confirmed as TD2.\nIn response to flg22, the researchers noticed that detection of TD2 by \u03b1-pAdi3 was reduced within the first hour of treatment, while the detection by \u03b1-TD2 was unchanged. As the antibodies recognize different fragments of the protein, this observation hinted that flagellin signaling induced alterations in the \u03b1-pAdi3 epitope (last 22 amino acids in the C-terminus of TD2). The authors then expressed TD2 fused to a 6xHis tag in either the N- or C-terminus and incubated them with flg22-treated extracts. They found that an \u03b1-6xHis antibody detected the tag only in the N-terminus fusion protein, suggesting a flg22-induced C-terminus cleavage of TD2.\nTD2 degrades threonine (Thr) to produce a precursor for isoleucine (Ile) biosynthesis (Sidorov et al. 1981; Gallagher et al. 1998), and its activity is susceptible to Ile feedback inhibition (Umbarger 1956). To test if the modification at the C-terminus could affect TD2 enzymatic properties, the authors expressed C-terminus truncated versions of TD2 and tested their activity and sensitivity to Ile. While the enzymatic activity was equal to the wild-type (wt) protein, the truncated variants were more sensitive to Ile feedback inhibition. Altogether these results suggest that, upon flg22 detection, TD2 is cleaved at the C-terminus, which compromises its enzymatic properties by increasing sensitivity to Ile feedback inhibition.\nExpression of TD2 is highly up-regulated in response to herbivore attack, which increases the availability of Ile for the synthesis of Jasmonoyl-Isoleucine (JA-Ile) (Kang et al. 2006), the most bioactive form of the jasmonates (Wasternack and Strnad 2016). JA-Ile promotes defense against herbivores and necrotrophs, which take nutrients from dead cells, and usually suppresses the response against biotrophs (Pieterse et al. 2012). To test if TD2 was also involved in the defense against microorganisms, the authors\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /plphys/article/192/1/19/7019526 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 13 January 2024\n20 | PLANT PHYSIOLOGY 2023: 192; 19\u201320 Fern\u00e1ndez-Milmanda\nchallenged td2 knockout lines with either Pst (biotroph) or Botrytis cinerea (necrotroph). The td2 lines were more resistant to Pst than the wt, while they showed enhanced susceptibility to B. cinerea. Thus, TD2 plays a negative role in the defense against biotrophs and a positive role against necrotrophs.\nIn summary, the results of Yeo et al. (2023) can be interpreted as part of a mechanism to control defenses against biotrophs (Fig. 1). Upon pathogen perception, flagellin signaling leads to the C-terminus cleavage of TD2, which compromises TD2 activity by increasing Ile feedback inhibition, and thus, likely leading to an Ile shortage. The limited amount of Ile could affect the levels of JA-Ile, repressing jasmonate signaling as a way to balance the antagonism between biotroph- and necrotroph-triggered defenses in tomato. However, whether flg22 represses JA-Ile synthesis in a TD2-dependent manner awaits further research.\nThe work of Yeo et al. (2023) represents an amazing story about how an artifact derived from antibody cross-reactivity led to a fortuitous discovery. It is also worth mentioning that TD2 cleavage has anti-insect activity (Chen et al. 2005; Chen et al. 2007; Gonzales-Vigil et al. 2011). Inside the caterpillar\ngut, proteolytic process of TD2 eliminates Ile feedback inhibition (Gonzales-Vigil et al. 2011). This variant of TD2 constitutively consumes Thr, leading to a nutrition imbalance in the insect gut (Gonzales-Vigil et al. 2011). Thus, TD2 exemplifies how protein modification can shape enzymatic activity to play completely different physiological roles.\nConflict of interest statement. None declared."
