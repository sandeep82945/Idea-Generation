Prior studies have underscored that self-esteem is associated\nwith cognition, and there exists a knowledge gap regarding whether self-esteem\nremains associated with subsequent cognitive performance during adolescence,\na crucial period for neurological development and influencing adult outcomes.\nMethods: We conducted this population-based study using longitudinal data\nstretching three waves (2014, 2016, and 2018) of surveys from the nationally\nrepresentative China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) to explore the association\nbetween adolescents\u2019 self-esteem in 2014 and cognitive performance in\n2014, 2016, and 2018.\nResults: The results of the present study showed that self-esteem during\nadolescence in 2014 was significantly associated with cognitive performance in\n2014, 2016, and 2018. This association remained robust after an extensive range\nof covariate adjustments (e.g., adolescents, parental, and family characteristics).\nConclusion: The findings in this study provide further insight into the\nunderstanding of the related factors for cognitive development across the\nlife course and highlight the importance of improving individual self-esteem\nduring adolescence.\nKEYWORDS\nadolescent, self-esteem, cognitive performance, cognition, longitudinal study\nIntroduction\nAdolescent is a crucial period for the development of cognition (Schalbetter et al., 2022). Cognitive performance includes many aspects, such as intelligence, rationality, and memory (Donnelly et al., 2016). Cognitive development is pivotal for adequate self-perception in relation to social environments and for cultivating learning and adaptative skills (Koh, 1982). As an essential determinant of behaviors and mental (Mo et al., 2021), it is very important to measure cognition scientifically. Previous studies have used composite tests in reading, math, science, and history to measure adolescents\u2019 cognitive performance (Marsh and Kleitman, 2003; Ruiz et al., 2010; Travlos, 2010). Following an initial period of cognitive\nFrontiers in Psychology 01 frontiersin.org\nmaturation, an individual\u2019s cognitive abilities are not immutable, but rather, subject to variability in response to contextual, developmental, dispositional, temperamental, and other factors (Horn and Cattell, 1966; Cattell, 1974). The implicit theories of intelligence have posited that individuals\u2019 intelligence or ability can be enhanced by the adoption of certain beliefs (e.g., motivation, self-esteem) which may lead to further optimization of personal intelligence (Dweck, 2000).\nGood cognitive performance in youth is associated with better school performance, increased employment prospects, and improved quality of life (Ramsden et al., 2011; Vera and Cort\u00e9s, 2021). In contrast, poor cognitive performance is related to reduced educational attainment, social impairments, impaired career opportunities, poor health conditions, and low self-esteem (Pruessner et al., 2004; Atique-Ur-Rehman and Neill, 2019; Chen et al., 2021). A study of 2,370 secondary school students in Chilean revealed that lower cognitive performance was associated with decreased levels of self-esteem (Huepe et al., 2011). Thus, good cognition is very important for the personal development of adolescents.\nSelf-esteem is characterized as the comprehensive assessment of an individual\u2019s cognition and affects in relation to the self as an object (Rosenberg, 1965). According to the two-factor model of self-esteem, global self-esteem comprises two components: self-competence and self-liking (Dutton and Cook, 2001). These dimensions involve the evaluation of one\u2019s capabilities and are associated with the process of introspection and the emotional responses to social feedback (Tafarodi and Milne, 2002). The selfconsistency theory posits that increased self-esteem facilitates the enhancement of self-perceptions and behaviors (Korman, 1970). Low self-esteem in children and youth is generally associated with negative attitudes and a diminished capacity for coping with daily and developmental challenges (Greenberg et al., 1992). Therefore, children with low self-esteem tend to engage in negative behaviors (e.g., school absences, drinking, and smoking) and are more likely to suffer from psychological disorders such as anxiety and depression (McGee et al., 2001; Donnellan et al., 2005). Additionally, several studies also revealed that low self-esteem may negatively impact adolescents\u2019 social relationships, health, school performance, and cognitive development (Falkner et al., 2001; Harris and Orth, 2020; Zapata-Lamana et al., 2021).\nGiven that low self-esteem has multiple negative effects on individuals, understanding how the association of adolescent selfesteem with cognitive performance is crucial. Adolescence is an important period for the development of self-esteem and cognitive performance. It is a critical period for individual cognitive, emotional, and social functional development, as well as for the development of self-esteem. Therefore, exploring the association between adolescent self-esteem and cognitive performance can provide important theoretical and practical value for adolescent mental health and academic growth.\nThe association between self-esteem and cognitive performance among children and adolescents has been confirmed by a body of studies (Martins et al., 2002; Sigfusdottir et al., 2007; Tobia et al., 2017; Zheng et al., 2020). However, while prior research has indicated that self-esteem is a relatively stable construct that is generally formed during childhood or adolescence and has long-lasting effects on subsequent outcomes (Wagner et al., 2016; Saini et al., 2021), it is unclear how this association manifests\nover time. The theory of self-esteem development in children and adolescents suggests that adolescence is a critical period for selfesteem development, and that the self-esteem during this period can predict subsequent personal development outcomes to a certain extent (James, 1890). Additionally, it has been suggested that selfesteem is related to underlying neural systems, such as neural and computational processes underlying dynamic changes in selfesteem (Will et al., 2017), which then contribute to cognition (Tsvetanov et al., 2016). Moreover, adolescents with high selfesteem tend to engage in cognitive stimulating activities (Zhao et al., 2021), which can enhance their cognitive performance (Wright et al., 2016). To gain a deeper understanding of the association between self-esteem and cognitive performance during adolescence, longitudinal studies are needed. Longitudinal studies can provide valuable insights into the directionality and stability of this association. This can help identify critical periods during which interventions aimed at improving self-esteem and cognitive performance may have the greatest impact.\nTo address this gap in the literature, the current study aims to investigate the association between self-esteem in 2014 and cognitive performance in 2014, 2016, and 2018 among adolescents aged 10\u201315 years old using nationally representative data in China. Specifically, we hypothesize that higher self-esteem in 2014 will be associated with better cognitive performance in subsequent years, and that this association will be stable over time."

This survey aims to conduct a longitudinal study of Chinese households, communities, and individuals. The follow-up survey was conducted every two years for CFPS respondents. Approximately 80.64% of the Chinese population was represented in the survey sample, which was drawn from 25 out of 31 provinces/municipalities/autonomous regions. The survey was conducted with a multistage proportional probability sample, involving the sampling of districts/counties, villages/communities, and households. The survey adopted a faceto-face questionnaire and computer-assisted personal interviewing as a tool to improve operational efficiency. This survey employed a suite of quality assurance measures, including telephone verification, field verification, audio recording checks, interview reviews, and statistical analysis to ensure data reliability (Xie and Lu, 2015). The 2014 survey was used as the baseline in our study, and 1518 adolescents aged 10\u201315 years old made up the sample of the 2014 survey. The participants identified in 2014 are used to track 2016 and 2018, respectively (Figure 1 and Table 1).\nThe CFPS was approved by Peking University\u2019s Biomedical Ethics Review Committee, and all participants provided written informed consent.

The original self-esteem scale consists of 10 questions, of which five questions are positive scoring questions and five questions are negative scoring questions. CFPS adapted the original self-esteem scale into 14 questions, adding additional items: \u201cI can\u2019t solve difficulties,\u201d \u201cI feel compelled by life,\u201d \u201cI have control over things,\u201d and \u201cI am often helpless in life.\u201d RSES has been widely used with good reliability in China and is tailored to the survey of the general population (Tian et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2019). On a five-point Likert scale, respondents selected their level of agreement with the positively rated question (1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = neither agree nor disagree, 4 = agree, 5 = strongly agree), and negative items were reverse scored. Generally, the higher the total score, the greater the level of self-esteem. The Cronbach\u2019s alpha for this measure was 0.717 in this study."

            "text": "The CFPS developed two sets of tests to assess cognitive performance in a nationally representative sample of individuals aged 10 years or older (Xie and Hu, 2014). Two sets of cognitive tests include word recall ability (immediate and delayed word recall tests), number sequence ability (number series test) in the 2016 wave of CFPS; word memorization (vocabulary test), and mathematical calculation abilities (mathematics test) in 2014 and 2018 waves of CFPS. The usage of both of these tests has been widely adopted and validated for measuring cognitive ability in\nChinese adults and adolescents in previous studies (Zhang et al., 2018; Ren et al., 2019; Li et al., 2021). As for the research process in 2016 CFPS databases, the respondents were shown a randomly presented list of 10 concrete nouns (e.g., rice, river, doctor) and then asked to recall as many of those words as they could in any order. Following approximately 5 min of delay, respondents were asked to recall as many of the original words related to subjective wellbeing as possible after answering 31 questions. For both the immediate and delayed word recall tests, the final test scores were calculated as the number of words correctly recalled by the respondents, ranging from 0 to 10. The number series test is a two-stage adaptive test consisting of three items per stage. Each test item consists of a series of numerical values with one value omitted, and respondents are asked to provide the missing value which accurately follows the numerical pattern. In the initial stage of the survey, all respondents were presented with three items of varying difficulty levels: an easier one, a moderately difficult one, and a more challenging one. Based on the number of correctly answered items in the first stage, respondents were then presented with one of four sets of three items, with varying levels of difficulty. The number series test has a score range of 0\u201315.\nAs for the research process in the 2014 and 2018 CFPS, there are 34 word-recognition questions and 24 standardized mathematics questions. All of these questions are drawn from standard textbooks and are ranked according to their difficulty level. Respondents\u2019 ability to answer the initial question depends on their education level, and the test ends after three incorrect answers. A respondent\u2019s final score is the rank of the hardest question he or she correctly answered. The respondents were unaware of the rules before taking the test, thus they would not have deliberately failed it. The mathematics test had a score range of 0\u201324, the vocabulary test had a score range of 0\u201334. High scores indicate better performance.\nIn this study, the word recall ability (immediate and delayed word recall tests) and word memorization (vocabulary test) tests were administered to assess school-related skills including word knowledge and verbal concept formation. While the number sequence ability (number series test) and mathematical calculation abilities (mathematics test) tests were conducted to evaluate the ability to obtain, process, and retain mathematical information.\nFrontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org"

Moreover, variance inflation factors were calculated for each variable to determine whether the generalized linear models were collinear.\nThird, we used a smoothing plot to depict the association between self-esteem and cognitive performance, adjusting for potential confounders. Using corresponding modules, threshold effects of confounding factors were also assessed.\nIn addition, we conducted a series of sensitivity analyses to ensure that the results were robust. First, we calculated the p for interaction by stratifying covariates among different subgroups and observing the trend of regression coefficients. We further examined whether the existing missing variables led to bias in our findings by conducting a multiple-imputation analysis. Finally, we calculated E-values to examine the possibility of unmeasured confounders between self-esteem and cognitive performance (Haneuse et al., 2019).\np < 0.05 was used as the standard of statistical significance, and statistical tests were two-sided.

In the survey of 2016 and 2018, data attrition was observed as a result of the following reasons, such as participant withdrawal, loss to follow-up, incomplete cognitive assessments, and instances where participants completed the survey but provided responses of \u201cunknown\u201d or \u201cinapplicable\u201d for the cognitive assessments. See Figure 1 and Table 1 for details.\nAssociation of self-esteem and cognitive performance\nThe unadjusted generalized linear models showed significant associations between self-esteem and cognitive performance (all p < 0.05). Except for the number series test in 2016 (\u03b2 = 0.04, 95% CI \u22120.01 to 0.10, p = 0.127), other outcomes were still statistically significant after covariate adjustment (all p < 0.05). See Table 2 for details. All the variance inflation coefficients of the variables in these models fell below the value of 1.2. Multicollinearity among variables did not appear to be significant.\nAfter adjusting for potential confounders, there was a positive linear association between self-esteem and the following outcomes: vocabulary test in 2014, immediate word recall in 2016, delayed word recall in 2016, and mathematics test in 2018 (all p < 0.05\nby using linear regression model).

As demonstrated by the twopiece piecewise regression models of the non-linear association between the self-esteem and mathematics test in 2014 and the vocabulary test in 2018, the estimated highest point was 45 for both (p for likelihood ratio test < 0.05).

In most subgroups, the stratified analysis showed a correlation between self-esteem and outcomes. For example, for adolescents aged 10\u201312 years old (\u03b2 = 0.13, 95% CI 0.10\u20130.17, p < 0.001) or aged 13\u201315 years old (\u03b2 = 0.20, 95% CI 0.12\u2013 0.27, p < 0.001) in 2014, female (\u03b2 = 0.15, 95% CI 0.10\u20130.20, p < 0.001) and male (\u03b2 = 0.21, 95% CI 0.14\u20130.27, p < 0.001), selfesteem was related to mathematics test scores in 2014. However, the correlation between self-esteem and outcome was not statistically significant in several subgroups. For example, adolescents whose paternal age was 46 years or older (\u03b2 = 0.06, 95% CI \u22120.09to 0.21, p = 0.413), maternal age was 46 years or older (\u03b2 = 0.17, 95% CI \u22120.04 to 0.38, p = 0.117). The correlation between selfesteem and mathematics test scores in 2018 was not statistically significant. According to the interaction test, the self-esteem effect on cognitive performance was not significantly affected by most variables in 2014, 2016, and 2018 (p for interaction > 0.05).

We found that self-esteem in\nadolescents 10\u201315 years old was positively associated with cognitive performance until four years later.\nOur study found that self-esteem was associated with cognitive performance. Specifically, adolescents\u2019 self-esteem in 2014 was positively associated with cognitive performance in 2014, 2016, and 2018. Although there is a lack of previous research on adolescents\u2019 self-esteem and cognitive performance. Much evidence on adolescents\u2019 self-esteem and academic performance exists. It is worth noting that the constituent indicators of academic performance in previous studies are also part of the cognitive performance of this study. For instance, a study from Bowles showed that there was an association between self-esteem and students\u2019 math test in the last semester (Bowles, 1999). Kugle et al. (1983) found that there was a strong association between the scores on the vocabulary reading tests and the level of selfesteem in children. According to the findings of Zapata-Lamana et al. (2021), adolescents with lower levels of self-esteem tend\nFrontiers in Psychology 06 frontiersin.org\nto perceive their cognitive abilities as subpar, as evidenced by their self-reported deficits in memory retention, slower problemsolving skills in mathematical contexts, increased difficulties in executing complex tasks, and greater challenges in maintaining focus during classroom activities. Variations in learning and academic achievement levels among adolescents in the school stage can be attributed to differences in cognitive abilities (Martins et al., 2016). Research suggested that cognitive abilities such as working memory, attention, and processing speed are crucial in facilitating learning and academic achievement (Moxley-Paquette and Burkholder, 2020; Esposito and Bauer, 2022). For instance, individuals with higher working memory capacity can retain and manipulate more information in their minds, which facilitates the learning process (Allen et al., 2021; Cotton and Ricker, 2022). Similarly, individuals with better attentional control can sustain their focus on the task at hand for a more extended period, leading to improved learning outcomes (May et al., 2013; Isbell et al., 2018). Moreover, cognitive abilities are also known to impact other factors that influence academic achievement, such as motivation and self-regulation. For example, individuals with better self-regulation skills can manage their time more effectively, avoid distractions, and persist with tasks until completion, which can lead to better academic performance (Sandars and Cleary, 2011; Sahranavard et al., 2018). Although there is a lack of direct research on the relationship between self-esteem and cognitive performance, there is evidence to suggest an indirect association between self-esteem and cognitive performance. Specifically, the association between self-esteem and academic achievement, as well as the strong association between cognitive ability and academic performance, provide evidence to support a potential link between self-esteem and cognitive performance. Thus, the association between adolescents\u2019 self-esteem and cognitive performance in our study emphasized the need for greater attention to be given to the role of self-esteem in the development and maintenance of cognitive abilities, particularly during adolescence when both self-esteem and cognitive functioning undergo significant changes.\nIn this study, curve-fitting plots revealed a positive association between adolescent self-esteem in 2014 and cognitive performance in 2014, 2016, and 2018. There is little clear evidence as to\nhow adolescents\u2019 self-esteem was associated with their cognitive performance, but the underlying related theories may help to explain this association. The self-fulfilling prophecy theory suggests that individuals\u2019 beliefs regarding themselves can have a powerful influence on their behavior and performance (Carvalho et al., 2018). According to this theory, individuals possessing high self-esteem may be more inclined to engage in activities that foster cognitive development (Madon et al., 1997), thus resulting in superior cognitive performance over time. Conversely, individuals possessing low self-esteem may be more likely to engage in activities that hinder cognitive development, leading to suboptimal cognitive performance over time. In addition, the social cognitive theory indicates that individuals\u2019 self-beliefs and motivation significantly impact their behavior and performance (Bandura, 2001). Specifically, individuals with high self-esteem tend to have positive self-concepts, leading to a sense of selfefficacy and motivation to engage in challenging activities that promote cognitive development. This, in turn, can lead to superior cognitive performance. Conversely, individuals with low self-esteem may experience negative self-concepts, leading to a lack of self-efficacy and motivation to engage in challenging activities that foster cognitive development, resulting in suboptimal cognitive performance. As well, the concept of cognitive reserve is also relevant to this finding. Cognitive reserve refers to the accumulation of knowledge, experience, skills, and intelligence that an individual acquires throughout their lifespan (Stern, 2002). It encompasses a range of knowledge and abilities acquired through learning and experiences, including vocabulary, learning ability, computational skills, attention, working memory, problem-solving ability, and comprehension (Fyffe et al., 2011; Stern et al., 2020). According to this concept, individuals who engage in activities that promote cognitive development, such as those with high selfesteem, may have a greater cognitive reserve, which can improve cognitive performance over time. These related theories could help to explain our results and provide an additional view to understanding the underlying association between adolescents\u2019 self-esteem and cognitive performance.\nThe current study has some limitations that need to be mentioned. First, similar to other large-scale longitudinal studies,\nFrontiers in Psychology 07 frontiersin.org\nthe sample in this study is affected by attrition that occurred over time. Second, a total of 665 participants passed all 3 waves. We only use 2014 as the baseline to track the cognitive performance of adolescents in 2016 and 2018, respectively. Future research should include only those who participate in all wave assessments in the analysis to evaluate the continuous changes in adolescents\u2019 cognitive performance in subsequent years. Third, we only investigated self-esteem in 2014 but did not investigate self-esteem in subsequent years. Future studies should follow up the selfesteem longitudinally to evaluate the change in self-esteem. Fourth, our study did not adjust for baseline cognitive performance in our longitudinal analysis. Future studies should consider adjusting for baseline cognitive performance in longitudinal analysis. Fifth, the assessment tool for adolescents\u2019 self-esteem is based on their self-report and therefore individuals\u2019 perceptions of selfesteem may be prone to bias. Sixth, the main idea of this study did not include the internal correlation of cognitive outcome measurement items. Future research should consider verifying the internal correlation between cognitive outcomes. Seventh, although the E-values of this study indicate that unobserved confounding is less likely to explain observed associations between adolescents\u2019 self-esteem and cognitive performance, there still may be bias resulting from the remaining unobserved confounding (e.g., family socioeconomic status). Eighth, based on prior research (Kang, 2023), it is essential to consider the potential influence of personality traits on the results of this study. As the current study utilizes the CFPS database, which does not measure personality traits, we cannot exclude the possibility of such traits having an impact on our findings. Therefore, future studies investigating the association between self-esteem and cognitive performance in adolescents should take into account the potential influence of personality traits. Finally, we use the commonly used evaluation metrics in China to measure cognitive performance, but cognitive performance is a complex and comprehensive metric, and for example, inhibition control (Kang et al., 2022) has not been evaluated in this study, so a more comprehensive evaluation may be needed."

The findings extend the understanding of the association between adolescent self-esteem and cognitive performance and highlight the importance of fostering positive self-esteem in adolescents, as it may have long-term benefits for cognitive performance. Based on these findings, improving individual selfesteem during adolescence may thus greatly broaden the window of opportunity for cognitive development."
