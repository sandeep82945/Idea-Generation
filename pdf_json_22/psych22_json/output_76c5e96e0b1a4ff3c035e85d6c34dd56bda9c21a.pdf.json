We recorded auditory responses of adults and 21 school-aged children (6-14y) using combined magneto- and electroencephalography (M/EEG) 22 during passive listening conditions and an auditory Go/No-go task. The associations between 23 auditory cortical responses and inhibition performance measures diverge between adults and 24 children; while in children the brain-behavior associations are not significant, or stronger 25 responses are beneficial, adults show negative associations between auditory cortical 26 responses and inhibitory performance. Furthermore, we found qualitative differences in 27 auditory responses between adults and children; the late (~200 ms post stimulation) adult peak 28 activation shifts from auditory to frontomedial areas. In contrast, children show prolonged 29 obligatory responses in the auditory cortex. Together this likely translates to a functional 30 difference between adults and children in the cortical resources for performance consistency 31 in auditory-based cognitive tasks. 32\n33\nKeywords 34\nMEG, EEG, response inhibition, auditory processing, cognitive control, development 35\nIntroduction 36\nResearch dedicated to understanding the development of the central auditory system was crucial 37 to reveal the important cortical timings in auditory perception in adults and children. It led to 38 the current understanding that cortical auditory evoked responses change substantially from 39 childhood to adulthood (Paetau et al., 1995; Johnstone et al., 1996; Ponton et al., 2000; Ponton 40 et al., 2002; Wunderlich and Cone-Wesson, 2006). These changes coincide with grey and white 41 matter transitions (Moore & Linthicum Jr, 2007) that interact with synaptic signaling to affect 42 the timing and amplitude during development. Indeed, the evoked responses can be used as a 43 measure of cortical network efficiency, as they rely on temporal accuracy of the cortex to 44 respond to stimuli. Likewise, the timings of the activation pattern are an indicator of (auditory) 45 development (Parviainen et al., 2011; H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen et al., 2013; van Bijnen et al., 2019). The 46 characteristics of these auditory evoked responses have important links with behavioral skills 47 both in adults and in children (e.g., N\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4nen, 1990; Jonhstone et al., 1996; Parviainen et al., 48 2011; van Bijnen et al., 2022), which makes them particularly useful in understanding 49 incremental cognitive competency in human development. 50\nThe time-windows of neural activation after auditory stimulation are, however, 51 remarkably different in children and adults. The polyphasic adult waveform, as measured by 52 electro- and magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG), is characterized by intermittent positive 53 deflections at ~50ms (P1) and ~150ms (P2) and a prominent negative deflection at ~100ms 54 (N1). In contrast, children typically show a biphasic response pattern consisting of a positive 55 deflection at ~100ms (P1) and a prolonged negative deflection at ~250ms (N250) (Picton et al., 56 1974; Ponton et al., 2000; Albrecht et al., 2000; \u010ceponien\u0117 et al., 2002; Takeshita et al., 2002; 57 Wunderlich et al., 2006; Sussman et al., 2008; Orekhova et al., 2013; Ruhnau et al., 2011; 58 Yoshimura et al., 2014). In the early time-window, the typical adult N1-P2 complex emerges 59 during adolescence (Sussman et al., 2008). However, the activity in the later time-window 60\n(~250ms) attenuates and is specific to the child-brain (Sussman et al., 2008; Parviainen et al., 61 2011; Parviainen et al. 2019). 62\nWe have previously shown that the later time-window (~250ms) of auditory activation 63 reflects behaviorally meaningful processes, as it contributes to variance in response inhibition 64 in children even when measured during passive listening conditions (van Bijnen et al., 2022). 65 While there seems to be converging evidence on the behavioral relevance of the later time-66 window for both auditory-based and more general skills during childhood (van Bijnen et al., 67 2022; Johnstone et al., 1996), the role of the early time-window responses remains unclear. 68 From one perspective, the early responses (< 200ms) are exogenous (obligatory) activity and 69 evoked in both adults and children, without any task or attention. However, there are indications 70 that neural processing in this time-window contributes to language and communication ability 71 (Parviainen et al., 2005; Yoshimura et al., 2014) and arousal or attention regulation (Orekhova 72 et al., 2012) in children. 73\nWe have suggested that children and adults employ divergent brain mechanisms for a 74 consistent performance in auditory based cognitive tasks. This claim was based on the finding 75 that children relied strongly on the child-specific auditory activation at 250ms for a consistent 76 performance on (auditory) inhibition tasks (van Bijnen et al., 2022). In contrast, it is well known 77 that adults rely on frontal/medial regions of the cerebral cortex during this time-window for 78 inhibitory and cognitive control processes (Nieuwenhuis et al., 2003; Huster et al., 2010; 79 Falkenstein et al., 1999; Smith et al., 2007; Botvinick et al., 2004; Chambers et al., 2009). Yet, 80 as far as we know, no studies have addressed this discrepancy. 81\nQualitative differences in neural activity pattern complicates comparisons between 82 children and adults in M/EEG studies. Combing M/EEG is favorable because MEG has better 83 signal-to-noise ratio, while EEG provides a better account of deeper and radial sources (Piastra 84 et al., 2020; Baillet, 2017). Therefore, even within adults the different deflections are best 85\npicked up by either MEG or EEG depending on the source locations and orientations (Shahin 86 et al., 2007; Piastra et al., 2020). Indeed, MEG auditory source waveforms vary across 87 individuals depending on the Heschl\u2019s gyrus gyrification type (Benner et al., 2017) and the 88 anatomical organization of the auditory cortex (Shaw et al., 2013). In children there is the added 89 difficulty of variability in the developmental stages even within a narrow age-range. Therefore, 90 source locations and orientations might differ between individuals and combined MRI and 91 M/EEG better accounts for these individual differences. 92\nIn the present study, we aimed to investigate possible differences in both the spatio-93 temporal characteristics of activation and the brain-behavior associations between children and 94 adults in the early auditory activation supporting response inhibition. We focused on the early 95 auditory responses that are prevalent in both children and adults and contrasted an auditory 96 Go/No-go task with a passive listening task (Fig 1.). 97\n98"

Eleven children and zero adults were excluded due to 103 data quality issues, not finishing the experiment, or structural abnormalities in the MRI. The 104 final dataset consisted of sixty-seven children (36 boys) aged between 6-14 years (M = 10.2, 105 SD = 1.4). and sixteen adults (13 women) aged between 20-30 years (M = 24.8, SD = 3.4). All 106 participants had normal hearing as tested with an audiometer. None of the participants had 107 neurological disorders or were on medication affecting the central nervous system. The study 108 was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4. An informed consent 109\nwas obtained from all children and their parents, and the adults in accordance with the 110 Declaration of Helsinki. All participants received compensation for participation (movie ticket 111 or gift card). 112\nThe children (but not adults) in this study have previously been described in van Bijnen 113 et al. (2022, which focused on the child-specific N250 activation. Here, we focused on the 114 transient (early) auditory responses that are typically present in both the adults and children. 115\n116\nTasks and procedure 120\n121\nThe task was presented as a game where the participants were asked to help science by studying 122 and protecting the clownfish population. Studio Dennis Parren (www.dennisparren.com) 123 created a visual environment (video) resembling a submarine with a captain giving instructions. 124 All stimuli were controlled by PsychoPy (V3.2) (Peirce et al., 2019) running on a Linux desktop 125 PC. Auditory stimuli were delivered binaurally to the subject through plastic tubes and 126 earpieces using an MEG-compatible hi-fidelity sound system. 127\nFirst, we measured resting state activity using two alternating 1.5 minutes eyes open 128 and closed sessions. Subsequently, the task started with the first passive listening (PL) oddball 129 task. Participants listened to a continuous stream of deviant (DT; 1.5 kHz) and standard (ST; 1 130 kHz) tones with a 70\u2012ms duration (10\u2012ms rise/fall time) separated with an inter-stimulus 131 interval varying between 1.6 and 2.0\u2012s and were instructed to ignore both tones while they 132 could watch a silent stop-motion video (\u201cPingu\u201d). After the first PL task participants completed 133 two blocks of alternating Go/No-go (GN) and oddball detection (OB) tasks before the break. 134 Stimuli were identical to the PL task, but participants were asked to either respond to the deviant 135 tone (OB) or the standard tone (GN). After a break, participants completed the same blocks of 136 the PL, GN & OB tasks as before the break. The complete procedure is shown in figure 1. 137\n138\nBehavioral assessment 139\n140\nCognitive skills were tested on a separate visit. The behavioral tests included subtests of 141 Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children Third edition (Wechsler, 1999) or Wechsler Adult 142\nIntelligence Scale, which was used to evaluate the general level of cognitive skills, and the 143 Stop Signal Task (SST) from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Automated Test Battery 144 (CANTAB). 145\nOf the Wechsler Intelligence scale, the similarities and block design subtests were 146 used to evaluate the general level of verbal and nonverbal reasoning, respectively, and digit 147 span (backward/forward) was used as a measure verbal short-term memory. The coding test 148 and the symbol search task were used to evaluate in general the speed of processing, 149 visuomotor coordination, and attention. 150\nThe SST was used to quantify a stop-signal reaction time (SSRT) in adults and children. 151 The SSRT is a behavioral performance measure of response inhibition, or the ability to stop an 152 already initiated motor response which we correlated with the auditory brain activation. In the 153 SST, the participant must respond to an arrow stimulus by selecting one of two options 154 depending on the direction in which the arrow points. The test consists of two parts: in the first 155 part, the participant is first introduced to the test and told to press the left-hand button when 156 they see a left-pointing arrow and the right-hand button when they see a right-pointing arrow. 157 There is one block of 16 trials for the participant to practice this. In the second part, the 158 participant is told to continue pressing the buttons when they see the arrows, but if they hear an 159 auditory signal (a beep), they should withhold their response and not press the button. The task 160 uses a staircase design for the stop signal delay (SSD), allowing the task to adapt to the 161 performance of the participant, narrowing in on the 50% success rate for inhibition. The SST 162 quantifies a stop-signal reaction time (SSRT); 163\nM/EEG and MRI data analysis 164\n165\nBrain responses were recorded using a 306-channel MEG system and the integrated EEG 166 system (Elekta Neuromag\u00ae TRIUX\u2122, MEGIN Oy, Helsinki, Finland). M/EEG data were 167 sampled at 1000Hz and filtered at 0.1\u2013330 Hz. Simultaneous 32-channel EEG and vertical and 168 horizontal electrooculograms (EOG) were recorded with an online reference on the right 169 earlobe. A head position indicator (HPI) continuously monitored the head position in relation 170 to the MEG sensors using five HPI coils, three anatomical landmarks (nasion, left and right 171 preauricular points) and 150 distributed scalp points. 172\nMEG data were first processed and converted to the mean head position with the 173 temporal signal space separation (tSSS) and movement compensation options, implemented in 174 the MaxFilter\u2122 program (version 3.0; MEGIN Oy, Helsinki, Finland). Using MNE-python 175 (Gramfort et al., 2013; Gramfort et al., 2014) data were low-pass filtered, re-referenced to the 176 average (EEG) and bad channels and data segments were excluded. Epochs were created from 177 \u20130.2 to 0.8 s relative to stimulus onset and a baseline correction was applied. Epochs from 178 incorrect responses during the task and large MEG signals (> 4 pT/cm for gradiometers, > 5 pT 179 for magnetometers) were rejected. Independent components representing ocular and/or cardiac 180 artifacts were suppressed with ICA (Hyv\u00e4rinen and Oja, 2000). Epochs were checked manually 181 and with autoreject (EEG) (Jas et al., 2017) to repair or exclude bad epochs. 182\nWe used cortically-constrained, depth-weighted (p = 0.8) L2 minimum norm estimate 183 (H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen and Ilmoniemi, 1994) with a loose orientation constraint (0.2) to characterize the 184 source currents. T1- and T2-weighted 3D spin-echo MRI images were collected with a 1.5 T 185 scanner (GoldSeal Signa HDxt, General Electric, Milwaukee, WI, USA) using a standard head 186 coil and with the following parameters: TR/TE = 540/10 ms, flip angle = 90\u00ba, matrix size = 256 187\nx 256, slice thickness = 1.2 mm, sagittal orientation. The cortical surface was constructed from 188 the individual MRIs with the Freesurfer software (RRID: SCR_001847, Martinos Center for 189 Biomedical Imaging, http://freesurfer.net; Dale et al., 1999; Fischl et al., 1999; Fischl et al., 190 2001). Next, the M/EEG data were registered to the individual structural data with MNE 191 coregistration using the anatomical landmarks, digitized EEG electrodes and additional scalp 192 points. The forward solution for the source space was constructed using a three-layer BEM with 193 the following conductivity values for brain/CSF, skull and scalp: .3, .006 and .3 for adults and 194 .33, .0132 and .33 for children. The noise covariance matrix was calculated from the individual 195 epochs 200-ms pre-stimulus baseline, using a cross validation method implemented in MNE. 196 The MEG and EEG data were combined into a single inverse solution by a whitening 197 transformation using the covariance matrix (Engemann and Gramfort, 2015). 198\nThe final source waveforms were computed as the mean value within the transverse 199 temporal gyrus (label 30 in the Desikan-Killianty Atlas; Desikan et al., 2006). The time-window 200 for the extraction of amplitude values were based on the grand averages (figure 3) where the 201 time-windows for the main peaks corresponded to those reported in earlier literature in children 202 and adults (Picton et al., 1974; Ponton et al., 2000; Albrecht et al., 2000; Orekhova et al., 2013; 203 Yoshimura et al., 2014). In children, we extracted the maximum value between 76\u2013104ms (P1), 204 minimum value between 108\u2013140ms (N1) and the difference between N1 and max value 205 between 148\u2013200ms (P2). In adults we extracted the same P1-N1-P2 responses in different 206 time-windows; 40\u201376ms, 92\u2013120ms and 140\u2013200ms respectively. 207\n208 Statistical analysis 209\nWe focused on the adult and child differences in the Passive Listening (PL) vs Go/No-Go task 210 (figure 1). Task requirements in the Go/No-Go task specifically engaged inhibition. Moreover, 211 our earlier (van Bijnen et al., 2022) study indicated that although both oddball and go/no-go 212\ncomparison both yielded behaviorally significant activation, the Go/No-go showed stronger 213 correlations. In order to limit unnecessary statistical testing, we therefore analyzed the deviant 214 tones of these tasks. . Importantly, between the tasks, the stimuli (DT), probability (30 percent) 215 and motor response (None) were identical. Auditory responses (P1-N1-P2) were analyzed 216 separately; models contained one of the brain responses (P1, N1 or P2) as dependent variable 217 at a time. Two within-subject independent (hemisphere (left, right) and task (passive, no-go)) 218 and one between-subject variable (group; children vs adults) were included in the model. 219 Models were estimated by using Multigroup analysis with Mplus statistical package (Version 220 8.4) and using a full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation method with robust 221 standard errors (MLR). All available data were used in the analyses and missing data were 222 assumed to be Missing at Random (MAR) (Muth\u00e9n & Muth\u00e9n, 2012). Interactions and main 223 effects were estimated by using additional parameters of model. 224\nSubsequently, we used (partial) correlations (corrected for age in children) to test for 225 relevant brain-behavior associations of the auditory responses. We included the following 226 behavioral performance measures: intra-individual reaction times (ICV; calculated as 227 SDRT/mean RT), response accuracy (RA; calculated as the square root of the error%) and the 228 stop-signal reaction time (SSRT). Correlational analysis was performed with SPSS statistics 229 25. 230\n231\nResults 232\nDescriptive statistics of cognitive skills and behavioral performance 233\nDescriptive statistics of the children\u2019s performance during the M/EEG experiment and their 234 cognitive skills as per the behavioral assessment session are presented in Table 1. The subtests 235 of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale were included to examine whether participants are within 236\ntypical range of cognitive performance and were not associated with the brain responses of 237 children and adults (p > .05). 238\nAge related differences in the auditory evoked responses 240\nFigure 2 shows the measured neuromagnetic responses to the standard tones in the passive 241 listening task at MEG sensor level (gradiometers). For visualization purposes, groups were 242 separated by age (< 10 years old, > 10 years old and adults). The activation pattern in younger 243 children indicate three separate peaks at ~85ms, at ~120ms and at ~250ms, but with some 244 overlap in timing especially in the youngest group. Furthermore, responses appear different in 245 the two hemispheres in children; with the P1m predominantly showing in the left-hemisphere, 246 the N1m predominantly showing in the right-hemisphere and the late N250m showing 247 bilaterally. In contrast, the activation peaks in adults occur somewhat earlier, at ~60ms and at 248 ~110ms, and the peak at ~250ms is clearly diminished. Adults also show less hemispheric 249 differences than children. 250\nDifferences in child and adult auditory responses 256\nThe localization of auditory activation in children indicates that the peaks across the entire time-257 line of activation all reflect cortical currents in the temporal regions irrespective of task and 258 time-window (figure 3 & 4). In contrast, in adults the early peak at 100ms reflects activation in 259 the temporal regions and the later activation at ~200-300ms reflects activation in the medial 260 regions of the cerebral cortex (e.g., cingulate cortex; figure 3). 261\nThe activation pattern at ~250ms in the auditory cortex is unique to the child brain (Fig. 262 3&4) in our data. Consequently, the activation pattern in children vs. adults in the 250-ms time-263 window reflects different brain regions, their strength is not directly comparable. Moreover, the 264\nactivation pattern at ~250ms in the auditory cortex is unique to the child brain (Fig. 3&4) in our 265 data. Therefore, we did not directly contrast adults and children for this activation pattern. The 266 behavioral relevance of this activation pattern in children is discussed elsewhere (van Bijnen et 267 al., 2022). Due to the qualitatively different nature of the activation at 250 ms, the statistical 268 analysis was limited to the earlier (50-200 ms) auditory cortex responses (P1-N1-P2) 269\n270\n281\nPassive vs Go/No-go 282 283 P1 284 285\nIn children both task (p < .001) and hemisphere (p = .001) significantly affected the amplitude 286 of the P1. The task effect was similar in the two hemispheres as the task x hemisphere 287 interaction was not significant (p = .301). More specifically, the P1 in the PL task was stronger 288 compared to the P1 in GN task in the left (M = 7.69, SD = 8.13 vs. M = 4.38, SD = 7.86) and 289 right hemisphere (M = 3.08, SD = 5.84 vs. M = 0.01, SD = 7.61). The P1 in children was 290 significantly stronger in the left, compared to the right hemisphere in both the PL and GN task 291 (p < .001). Finally, there was no main effect of group on the P1 (p = .296). 292\nAdults showed the same task effect as children, but no hemisphere effect since the group 293 x task interaction was not significant (p = .163) but the group x hemisphere interaction was 294 significant (p = .012). The task effect was similar in the two hemispheres as the task x 295 hemisphere interaction was not significant (p = .301)and the group x task x hemisphere 296 interactions (p = .204) were not significant. Similar to the child group, the P1 in the PL task 297 was stronger compared to the P1 in GN task in the left (M = 5.59, SD = 4.44 vs. M = 4.7, SD = 298 3.97) and right hemisphere (M = 6.13, SD = 4.87 vs. M = 2.91, SD = 4.02). 299\n304\nThe P1 did not consistently correlate with age in children, with only the No-go P1 in the 305 right-hemisphere reaching significance (r = -.28, p = .02). No significant correlations were 306 found between the P1 in children and their behavioral performance. In adults however, stronger 307 No-go P1 in the left hemisphere was related to a higher ICV (more variability) (r = .69, p = 308 .003). The correlation matrix is presented in table 2 and the associated scatterplot in figure 6. 309\nNote: ICV = intra-individual coefficient of variability, RA = response accuracy, SSRT = stop 319 signal reaction time. *p < 0.05, **p < .01, ***p < 0.001. 320 321 322\nstronger compared to left-hemisphere N1 responses in both tasks and groups (p < .001) (Figure 338 7). 339\n340\nThe N1 did not consistently correlate with age in children , with only the No-go N1 in the right-346 hemisphere reaching significance (r = -.26, p = .035). In children, a stronger left-hemisphere 347 N1 response in the PL task is associated with lower ICV (r = .302, p = .03). In contrast, adults 348 show opposite associations with a stronger left-hemisphere N1 response associated with higher 349 ICV (table 3) and poorer performance in both the PL (r = -.701, p = .003; r = -.67, p = .004, 350 respectively) and GN (r = -.612, p = .012; r = -.793, p < .001, respectively) task.

In adults, left-hemisphere No-388 go P2 responses were associated with higher SSRT (r = .55, p = .027), higher ICV (r = .538, p 389 = .031) and worse response accuracy (r = .535, p = .033).

First, 412 children rely on auditory areas for an extended period of time to process auditory information 413 during a Go/No-go task compared to adults; the adult activation pattern shifts at ~200ms from 414 auditory to medial regions of the cerebral cortex that are implicated in cognitive control 415 processing, whereas children show prolonged obligatory responses in the auditory cortex. This 416 indicates a qualitative difference in cognitive control processing between adults and children. 417 Second, the associations between the early auditory cortical responses and inhibition 418 performance measures diverge between adults and children; while in children the brain-419 behavior associations are not significant, or stronger responses are beneficial, adults show 420 negative associations between auditory cortical responses and inhibitory performance. Together 421 this likely translates to a functional difference between adults and children in the cortical 422 resources for performance consistency in auditory-based cognitive control tasks. 423\nThe developmental changes that have been indicated to reflect more efficient auditory 424 processing are a more pronounced N1 and in general a gradual temporal dissociation of the 425 earlier responses (P1-N1-P2) and an attenuation of the later N2 response (Ponton et al., 2000; 426 Albrecht et al., 2000; \u010ceponien\u0117 et al., 2002; Takeshita et al., 2002; Wunderlich and Cone-427 Wesson, 2006; Sussman et al., 2008). The age-related dynamics, specifically the decrease in P1 428 at the early stages of development and a subsequent increase in N1 , are in line with the present 429 findings and are together likely to reflect maturational differences in the cortical circuitry 430 (Orekhova et al., 2012). Notably, deep layers (lower III to IV) in the auditory cortex mature 431 earlier, between 6 months and 5 years of age, compared to the superficial layers (upper III and 432 II) that mature somewhere between 6\u250012 years (Ponton et al., 1999; Eggermont & Ponton, 433 2003; Moore & Guan, 2001; Moore & Linthicum, 2007). As we studied older children, their 434 cortical P1 generators arguably closely reflect that of adults, unlike the neural generators of the 435\nN1 that are still developing in our sample of children. Accordingly, we found no age or group 436 effects of the P1, but did for the N1 and P2. A similar explanation could account for our task 437 effect in the P1 that showed smaller amplitudes to the No-go compared to the passive tones in 438 both adults and children, but not in the N1 and P2. Indeed, highlighting the different neural 439 generators of the P1 and N1/P2, a study modelling the adult auditory responses reported that an 440 initial excitatory thalamocortical feedforward drive to layer II/III and V, via layer IV induced 441 the P1. In contrast, a cortico-cortical feedback input to supragranular layers with a subsequent 442 second feedforward input induced the N1 and P2 respectively (Kohl et al., 2019). Apparently, 443 the necessity to inhibit a response lowers the thalamocortical input that is associated with the 444 P1. 445\nIn addition to the amplitude and latency changes to the auditory responses, their function 446 also changes; children seem to rely more strongly on sensory activation in active (inhibition) 447 tasks. We show that, while the adult\u2019s early auditory components (i.e., P1-N1-P2) are all 448 negatively related to inhibitory performance, the early responses in children are not, or are 449 (weakly) positively related. Instead, the child-specific auditory activation pattern at ~250 ms 450 post-stimulation (N2) in the left-hemisphere is reported to be strongly (positively) related to 451 inhibitory performance (Johnstone et al., 1996; van Bijnen et al., 2022). 452\nEarlier studies have highlighted the discrepancies between the early (P1-N1-P2) and the 453 later, obligatory, (N2) response pattern in children, calling it \u201cthe additional process\u201d 454 (Johnstone et al., 1996) and suggesting it reflects the child\u2019s wider range of attentional focus, 455 resulting in similar neural response patterns in distinct situations (e.g., active vs passive) while 456 still behaviorally relevant (Johnstone et al., 1996; van Bijnen et al., 2022). Our data supports 457 this claim as we were unable to falsify that the early response amplitudes are not behaviorally 458 relevant for inhibitory performance in children. Thus, the child-specific, obligatory, N2 459 response seems to be unique in its behavioral relevance compared to the earlier obligatory 460\nauditory responses in children. Another possibility is that the early auditory child responses are 461 also beneficial for task performance, but perhaps the child and adult brain-behavior associations 462 are diametrically opposed. This would complicate matters; as the brain-behavior associations 463 possibly \"flip\u201d during development and this could limit the ability to detect brain-behavior 464 associations in the P1-N1-P2 complex in children. 465\nOur data are in line with previous studies on the adult neurobiological mechanisms of 466 response inhibition and shows it is remarkably different in children in auditory based tasks. In 467 adults, response inhibition is supported by a broad frontoparietal network (Weiss & Luciana, 468 2022; Puiu et al., 2020) and similarly the midcingulate cortex is reported to be a major neural 469 generator of the adult N2 in active tasks (Huster et al., 2010). However, we show that, in 470 children, the major source of activation in this time-window during No-go trials is in the 471 auditory cortex. It suggests that this auditory activation pattern in children becomes obsolete as 472 the brain becomes more efficient in discriminating auditory stimuli and determining their 473 behavioral relevance. The child brain is not merely an \u201cminiature\u201d adult brain but the 474 mechanisms that govern inhibitory performance in children are functionally distinct from 475 adults. The maturational changes in the auditory response coincide with improvement in 476 inhibitory performance during childhood and adolescence, but this transition is likely aided by 477 child-unique mechanisms. 478\nThis study cannot give a causal explanation for the neural and behavioral changes during 479 development. However, this is a comprehensive study that contrasted source models of adult 480 and child auditory processing and investigated the relevance for response inhibition. The 481 experiment was carefully designed to limit external factors (e.g., differences in motor and/or 482 stimuli between conditions). Thus, this is the most direct comparison possible between active 483 and passive tasks. In combination with our methods (combined M/EEG and individual MRIs) 484\nit provides greater confidence in our conclusion that associations between auditory activation 485 and inhibition task performance differ in adults and children. 486\nFuture studies should look at individual changes over time (i.e., longitudinal) to 487 investigate whether the developmental changes relate to the improved performance in response 488 inhibition. Ideally, this should also include magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure 489 the biochemical changes in the brain, as maturation of GABAergic vs. glutamatergic circuits 490 likely play a crucial role in both auditory and response inhibition development (Le Magueresse 491 & Monyer, 2013; Sanes & Kotak, 2011; Du et al., 2016; Silveri et al., 2013). Moreover, an 492 important remaining question is whether the effects are limited to the left-hemisphere, or 493 depend on handedness. 494\nThe clinical importance of achieving competent response inhibition highlights the value 495 of a complete understanding of the typical development of this process. This study shows 496 remarkable differences between adults and children in (auditory) processing during response 497 inhibition. It emphasizes the cruciality of sensory processing during (critical) periods of 498 development until adult-like response inhibition networks have matured sufficiently. Future 499 studies that examine the source models longitudinally, and account for biochemical changes, 500 would be welcomed. 501\n502\nAcknowledgements 503\nWe are grateful to Hanna-Maija Lapinkero, Suvi Karjalainen, Maria Vesterinen & Janne 504 Rajaniemi for help with data collection and to Amit Jaiswal, Erkka Heinil\u00e4 and Jukka Nenonen 505 for their help with preprocessing and scripting and Joona Muotka for help with the statistical 506 analysis.
