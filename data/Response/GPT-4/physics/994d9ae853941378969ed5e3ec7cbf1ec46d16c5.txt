In-depth Study of pH-sensitive Residues: Given the significant role of pH in driving conformational changes and polymorph transitions in insulin, future research could focus on a detailed molecular and structural analysis of pH-sensitive residues, particularly GluB13. Investigating how these residues interact with various ions and molecules at different pH levels could reveal new insights into insulin's structural dynamics and its interactions with its receptor.

Zinc-to-Insulin and Thiocyanate-to-Insulin Ratio Variations: The paper speculates on the effect of varying zinc-to-insulin and thiocyanate-to-insulin ratios on insulin's polymorphism. Systematic studies altering these ratios could help clarify the conditions under which different insulin polymorphs are stabilized, offering deeper understanding into the role of zinc and thiocyanate ions in insulin structure and function.

Single-Crystal X-ray Diffraction Studies for Higher Resolution Models: The paper suggests pursuing single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments to obtain higher resolution structural models of the different insulin polymorphs. Such studies could provide clearer insights into the atomic-level changes occurring during pH-driven phase transitions and offer a more detailed view of the structural alterations in the N-terminal region of chain B.

Comparative Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Insulin Polymorphs: Expanding on the molecular dynamics simulations performed in the study, future work could explore the conformational plasticity of insulin in more depth by comparing the dynamics of various polymorphs under different environmental conditions. This could include studies on solvent effects, temperature variations, and the presence of different ions, to understand how these factors influence insulin's structure and function.

Design and Testing of Insulin Analogs: Insights gained from the study on insulin's conformational plasticity and the impact of pH on its structure could be used to design insulin analogs with improved therapeutic properties. Future research could focus on designing analogs that maintain their functional conformation across a broader range of physiological conditions, potentially leading to more stable and effective insulin formulations for diabetes treatment.
