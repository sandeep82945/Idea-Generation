            "text": "Chair: Juleen\u00a0Rodakowski Discussant: Juleen\u00a0Rodakowski\nOlder adults experiencing cognitive decline, including those with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and related dementias, are at-risk for social isolation and participation restrictions, especially given the COVID-19 pandemic. Previously examined research has primarily focused on reducing problematic behaviors and remediating cognition for individuals with cognitive impairments. In this symposium, we will discuss novel intervention approaches and under-studied aspects of lifestyle behaviors that minimize social isolation and maximize participation for older adults with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and related dementias. Information presented in this symposium is intended to inform future intervention research to achieve an optimal quality of life for those with cognitive impairments. The first presentation will describe an analysis of lifestyle behaviors and cognition in an older population. The second presentation will discuss the development of an intergenerational, active music intervention that is delivered virtually to individuals with dementia and their caregivers. The third presentation will describe the effects of an adaptive horseback riding program that is becoming increasingly prevalent and improves the quality of life of persons living with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and related dementia."

Forced social isolation negatively impacts the quality of life of persons living with ADRD by worsening behavioral and psychological symptoms. Given continued pandemic restrictions\nand poor outcomes, now is the time to develop and support programs designed to improve quality of life through meaningful interactions that occur in natural environments. This symposium will introduce \u2018Riding in the Moment\u2019, an adaptive riding program that improves the quality of life of persons living with ADRD. Program participants are provided a safe, social, and supportive natural environment where they can ride, groom, and care for horses. The experiences constructed from Riding in the Moment seek to impact the current public health crisis by reducing social isolation for a growing and vulnerable population."

University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States, 2. BriTE Wellness Inc, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States\nThe coronavirus pandemic upended in-person programming for older adults with cognitive decline, presenting an urgent need to explore options to offer virtual programming. This program development report describes the adaptation of a music program for older adults with memory loss from in-person to a digital format. The objective was to develop a music program that was both engaging for the older adults, acceptable for the music instructor, and clearly defined for future research and implementation. This report describes the content of the music program and the systematic process of its development, including stakeholder interviews, acceptability surveys, fidelity reviews, and the developed instructor manual. With these structures in place, future research could begin to discern if digital music programming can support older adults in the same way that has been demonstrated in-person, potentially offering a new way to support the cognitive and social needs of a vulnerable population."

This study used the AARP Staying Sharp online brain health assessment platform to estimate the progression of a cognitive composite and correlate it with six modifiable lifestyle behaviors (physical activity, diet, sleep, stress, social activity, and brain engagement) in 147,939 participants (68.6\u00a0\u00b1 7.0\u00a0years old; 70% female). A\u00a0cognitive composite was created using attention, immediate and delayed recall, and working memory tasks and lifestyle behaviors were collected by self-report. A\u00a0lower frequency of exercise (p=0.01), a higher frequency of sitting (p=0.03), a lower frequency of getting in touch with family and friends (p=0.04), and the inability to manage stress (p=0.02) were associated with a decline in the online cognitive composite. A\u00a0self-administered online assessment platform may be useful in informing lifestyle modification interventions for risk reduction of cognitive impairment and dementia.\now nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /innovateage/article/6/Supplem ent_1/46/6936723 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024"
