            "text": "As quality often cannot be measured directly, quality indicators (QI) are a commonly used method to ensure healthcare quality. In Austria, the Austrian Quality Indicators (AIQI) system uses secondary data to ensure and monitor treatment quality nationwide [1].\nHowever, A-IQI only keeps track of intramural treatment quality and lacks quality measures for the outpatient care. But this area is very important as the transition to outpatient care is a challenge for both, healthcare professionals and patients. There is still a lack of information flow [2] and low adherence may lead to higher morbidity and mortality [3]. To address this issue, in the QI-KA project, cross-sector QI for the Austrian healthcare system were developed. The pilot study explicitly covers both, the intramural and the extramural sector and is using the myocardial infarction as a tracer [4]. To automatically evaluate conformance and perform a conformance checking of those quality indicators, it is necessary to 1) design and model the guidelines defined in each QI using a (semi-)formal modelling language, 2) generate process logs based on secondary data and 3) perform the conformance checking itself by re-playing [5, p. 10].\nIn this paper we focus on part 1) \u2013 the (semi-)formal design of the \u201cto-be\u201d processes and guidelines. Our objective was to gather the specific requirements of the healthcare\n1 Corresponding Author: Julia M.

            "text": "It is quite common to transfer methods from the industrial sector to the healthcare sector. Thus, vocabulary like \u201cBusiness process\u201d and \u201cCustomer value\u201d are being translated into \u201cTreatment process\u201d and \u201cPatient value\u201d [6, p. 29]. However, the Austrian healthcare system is also quite different from industrial processes with respect to financial structures, flexible, but complex treatment processes and particularly strict data protection, regulatory and legal requirements [6, pp. 3-4].\nTo meet these special requirements, there are several approaches in adapting standardized modelling languages to the demands of healthcare, Wiemuth et al. [7] are proposing the usage of the Case Management Model and Notation and the Decision Model and Notation (DMN), which are like the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) being developed by the Object Management Group. Scheuerlein et al. [8] have introduced the Tangible Business Process Modelling method to be used together with BPMN to give medical specialists an easy-to-follow introduction to process modelling.\nTo complete the picture from process modelling to conformance checking, we also considered current research activities in the process mining field. In 2017, Baker et al [9] used process mining to model electronic health record (EHR)-based clinical pathways in oncology. Their results show: almost every patient follows an individual treatment pathway, but there will be a significant overlap of activities, albeit in different sequences."

            "text": "First, we identified the specific requirements on modelling languages and to what extent these are met by popular modelling languages. We also identified requirements on modelling tools and finally modelled the QI-2 \u201cEchocardiography\u201d in BPMN combined with DMN.\nGeneral requirements on modelling languages as described in [10, p. 9] are expressiveness, simplicity and comprehensibility, formalisation and precision, visualisation, developer support, openness, customisation, vendor-independency as well as analysis and simulation. However, healthcare processes differ from generic industrial processes and thus the requirements on modelling languages do as well. For example, in clinical decision support systems, it may be of interest whether a particular treatment path is evidence-based and how its outcome is. Burwitz et al. [11] therefore defined requirements on modelling languages specifically for the healthcare sector. Those requirements comprise among others the clinical state, treatment step, variable and parallel flow, evidence indicators, evidence-based decisions, and time events [11, pp. 1330-1331]. Mulyar et al. [12] compared the main modelling languages for computer interpretable guidelines (CIGs) with the control flow patterns used in workflow systems. They found that most CIG languages don't support even half of the control-flow patterns and CIG languages add little flexibility compared to business process modelling concepts. However, it is emphasised that CIG languages do add flexibility mainly by providing expression languages for the modelling of complex decisions.\nRequirements and features of modelling tools are often divided into categories to have a better overview and to put an emphasis on one of the categories where necessary\n\u201cAnalysis\u201d, \u201cImplementation\u201d, \u201cManagement and Administration\u201d. The \u201cDesign and Modeling\u201d category thereby comprises features like the support of standardized modelling languages, building forms and creating workflows, Drag-and-Drop functionality, the visualisation of processes and attributes, activity and flowchart mapping, process hierarchies and collaborate process design.\nThus, we choose BPMN as it is standardized, providing openness, company independency and a diagram interchange format. Furthermore, BPMN is designed to be executable and is widely supported by modelling tool vendors. As the conditions for the indication check are quite complex, we decided to complement BPMN by using DMN for this task as proposed by [7]. As modelling tools, we used SAP Signavio Process Manager2 and ARIS 10 Designer and Architect3. We evaluated the appropriateness for our use case regarding Design and Modelling functionality and exchange formats of tools, but also expressiveness, simplicity, and visualisation aspects of the modelling languages."

            "text": "The QI-KA project demonstrates the usage of cross-sector QI by using the acute myocardial infarction as a tracer and defining the event of infarction as index event. Six quality indicators have been developed, of which we took quality indicator No. 2 (QI-2) to design the treatment guidelines in a formal modelling language.\nQI-2 was developed to check whether an echocardiogram has been performed\nwithin six weeks of the index event (QI-2-echo). In addition, QI-2 verifies if an implantable cardiac device has been implanted only with given indication and within the correct timeframe (QI-2-impl) [4, p. 66]."

            "text": "QI-2-echo is the first aspect and specifies that an echocardiography should be performed between 6 and 12 weeks after the infarction. While the index event is usually treated in a hospital, the echocardiography may take place in an outpatient setting or at a rehabilitation clinic. However, intramural documentation is often better than in outpatient care, e.g., by providing encoding in the International Classification of Diseases, Version 10 (ICD-10).\nFigure 1 shows a BPMN process diagram for QI-2-impl, which verifies the implantation of a cardiac device took place according to the current treatment guidelines. The process starts with the index event, an acute myocardial infarction (ICD-10 code I21.*). It is necessary to wait 48 hours before assessing the indication for an implant. If there is no indication, an implantation should not be conducted. If the implantation of a cardiac device is indicated, other factors are clarified and the patient gave consent, a minimum of 40 days must elapse from the index event before the surgery can be conducted and it should be performed within one year from the index event.\nThis BPMN diagram is easily understandable and visually appealing. The process flow can be followed easily, whereas all important treatment steps are described precisely. Therefore, it is well suited to be discussed interdisciplinary with medical\n2 https://www.signavio.com/products/process-manager/ 3 https://documentation.softwareag.com/aris/Architect/index.htm\ntime-based conditions are not clear enough for automated execution. They are only typed as literal strings and ambiguous in their meaning. E.g., the timer \u201cT40d\u201d could also be interpreted as \u201cwait 40 days after patient gave consent\u201d. Moreover, the swimlane approach might also be a disadvantage, as the boundaries between inpatient and outpatient care may vary from case to case. E.g depending on the patient\u2019s health condition, the consultation may take place in an inpatient or in an outpatient setting.\nTo assess the indication for an implantable device, we complemented our BPMN model with DMN. To verify the indication, the Decision Requirement Diagram (DRD) in Figure 2 defines the decision requirements and the required input, which in this case are ICD-10 codes.. The results of the indication-check for the implantable cardioverterdefibrillator (ICD) and for the pacemaker, formally Cardiac Resynchronisation Therapy (CRT) will flow and thereby determine the top-level decision \u201cIndication for implantation given?\u201d.\nFirst, however, the sub-decision \u201cReview indication for ICD implant\u201d, located at the bottom left in Figure 2, will be discussed.\nThe decision logic is defined in decision tables. DMN\u2019s Friendly Enough Expression Language (FEEL) aims to be useable by developers, as well as by business users. It offers a simple data model and syntax together with the three-value logic, plus a variety of builtin data types and functions to define decision logic in a simple manner [14]. Figure 3 shows the decision table for the ICD indication check as an example. To answer the question \u201cIndication for ICD implant given?\u201d with \u201cyes\u201d (true), there must be a diagnosis for New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II-III, ICD-10 I50.* (true), but not for I50.11 AND a diagnosis for ischaemic cardiomyopathy (ICD-10 I25.5) AND the patient\nI47.2) OR other cardiac arrhythmias (ICD-10 I49.0). In each other case, the decision table will evaluate to false.\nWe chose hit policy \u201cFirst (single)\u201d so that the first matching rule is applied.\nThe indication for a pacemaker, formally a Cardiac Resynchronisation Therapy (CRT), is given with the following diagnosis: [4, pp. 71-72]\nNYHA Class II-III \u2013 ICD-10 I50.* except I50.11 AND Left bundle-branch block, unspecified \u2013 ICD-10 I44.7 The associated decision table is linked to the decision \u201cReview indication for CRT\nimplant\u201d, located on the bottom right in the DRD diagram (Figure 2).\nTo implant a Cardiac Resynchronisation Therapy Defibrillator (CRT-D) both, the indication for an ICD and for a CRT must be present. The top-level decision \u201cIndication for implantation given?\u201d in Figure 2 checks if either the indication for an ICD, for a CRT, for both or for none is given. If the indication for both, an ICD and a CRT is given, the implantation of a CRT-D is proposed.\nWe linked this top-level decision with the task \u201cAssess indication for implantation\u201d so that \u2013 when correctly implemented \u2013 the result of this decision will be transferred to the BPMN diagram and influences the following decisions.\nIn addition, we compared the tools used, regarding the user-interface, the supported modelling languages, import- and export-functionalities and simulation capabilities. We found that Signavio Process Manager is well suited in terms of BPMN, DMN and UML modelling support. It offers basic simulation capabilities for BPMN models whereas DMN simulation is convincing and intuitive. Unfortunately, for DMN models only an export-option is offered. At ARIS Architect we especially liked the repository capabilities and the broad range of supported modelling languages. However, ARIS Architect itself does not offer any simulation features.\nWe exported a BPMN model and a DMN model from Signavio Process Manager to import it in ARIS Architect and vice versa. This worked especially well for BPMN models, whereas with DMN models we are not convinced, that the functions of Signavio Process Manager would still be executable in another simulation program. Also, when looking into the code of exported files, the DMN files vary more than the BPMN files."

However, BPMN lacks some specific requirements of healthcare \u2013 in our case mainly flexibility in task sequence and responsibility areas, as well as complex or timebase conditions. For the latter one, DMN convinced as a well-suited complement by separating decision requirements and decision logic. However, tool support for DMN less mature. Although these results are very promising, research should be extended to other medical areas. Moreover, the outcome of the designed models and of conformance checking should be discussed in an interdisciplinary team \u2013 consisting of IT professionals, data engineers, physicians, caregivers, and funders."
