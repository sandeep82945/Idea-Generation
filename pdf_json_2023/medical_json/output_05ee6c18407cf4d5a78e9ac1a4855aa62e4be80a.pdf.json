    "abstractText": "Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxypropionate) [P(3HB-co-3HP)] is a biodegradable and biocompatible polyester with improved and expanded material properties compared with poly(3hydroxybutyrate) (PHB). This study engineered a robust malonyl-CoA pathway in Cupriavidus necator for the efficient supply of a 3HP monomer, and could achieve the production of [P(3HB-co3HP)] from variable oil substrates. Flask level experiments followed by product purification and characterization found the optimal fermentation condition (soybean oil as carbon source, 0.5 g/L arabinose as induction level) in general consideration of the PHA content, PHA titer and 3HP molar fraction. A 5 L fed-batch fermentation (72 h) further increased the dry cell weight (DCW) to 6.08 g/L, the titer of [P(3HB-co-3HP)] to 3.11 g/L and the 3HP molar fraction to 32.25%. Further improving the 3HP molar fraction by increasing arabinose induction failed as the engineered malonyl-CoA pathway was not properly expressed under the high-level induction condition. With several promising advantages (broader range of economic oil substrates, no need for expensive supplementations such as alanine and VB12), this study indicated a candidate route for the industrial level production of [P(3HB-co-3HP)]. For future prospects, further studies are needed to further improve the strain and the fermentation process and expand the range of relative products.",

            "text": "With the exhaustion of fossil resources and environmental issues with regards to petro-derived durable polyesters, polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAS) and other biodegradable polyesters have attracted interest as renewable substitutes [1]. One of the representative PHAs is poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (P3HB) [2], which can be naturally produced by many microorganisms. Cupriavidus necator H16 (also called Ralstonia eutropha H16) is one of the commercial strains in P3HB production, which can efficiently produce intracellular P3HB [3] from oil substrates. The full genome study of Cupriavidus necator H16 revealed its efficient P3HB pathway, mainly including 3-ketothiolase (PhaA), NADPH-dependent acetoacetyl-CoA reductase (PhaB) and PHA synthase (PhaC) [3]. Due to the high crystallinity and brittleness, P3HB has limitations in the polyester market and hundreds of copolymer derivatives of P3HB have been developed to improve the material\u2019s properties [4\u20136]. For example, the addition of 3-hydroxypropionate (3HP) monomer in poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxypropionate) (P(3HB-co-3HP)) will improve the thermal property, stiffness, malleability and tensile strength compared with the\nBioengineering 2023, 10, 446. https://doi.org/10.3390/bioengineering10040446 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/bioengineering\nBioengineering 2023, 10, 446 2 of 11\nproperties of P3HB [7]. Differently to 3HB, biosynthetic pathways (pduP pathway, malonylCoA pathway, \u03b2-alanine pathway) of 3HP do not exist in natural strains, thus feeding 3HP or the precursors of 3HP (1,5-pentanediol and \u03b2-alanine) during the fermentation process in the general strategy for the microbial production of P(3HB-co-3HP) [8\u201311]. A pioneering study attempted the de novo biosynthesis of P(3HB-co-3HP) from different carbon sources. For example, the pduP pathway was engineered in Escherichia coli for P(3HB-co-3HP) production from glycerol [12]. Another study further engineered the pduP pathway in E. coli to produce P(3HB-co-3HP) from glucose [13]. However, the major bottleneck of the pduP pathway is that vitamin B12 is required to maintain the function of glycerol dehydratase. The malonyl-CoA pathway was also engineered in C. necator for the de novo production of P(3HB-co-3HP) from fructose or alkanoic acids; however, due to the low efficiency of malonyl-CoA reductase under a mild temperature, the content of 3HP monomer was quite low (around 2% mol of 3HP) in P(3HB-co-3HP) [14], indicating the low efficiency of the natural malonyl-CoA pathway in the engineered strains. Therefore, it is essential to further research and optimize the de novo biosynthesis of P(3HB-co-3HP) from a broader range of carbon sources by using the malonyl-CoA pathway. In this study, a modified full malonyl-CoA pathway was engineered in C. necator for the de novo biosynthesis of P(3HB-co-3HP) from three oil substrates. In addition, this study researched the effects of induction level (arabinose) on the production of P(3HB-co-3HP), aiming to regulate the content of 3HP in polyester products."

In 3HP production, the fragmentized MCR presented a higher efficiency in the mild condition (around 30 \u25e6C) than the natural MCR, which preferred a higher temperature (57\u201359 \u25e6C) [16,23].

The increased incorporation of 3HP into P(3HB-co-3HP) was confirmed by qualitative NMR analysis (Figure 3) and a quantitative GC assay in flask fermentation by C. necator ZL1 under 30 \u25e6C; the mol% of 3HP in the copolymer can reach 20\u201330% (Table 3), which is significantly higher than in the previous study that utilized natural MCR and only produced a copolymer with 2% (mol%) of 3HP [14].

            "text": "Another advantage of the malonyl-CoA pathway in PHA production is that it can theoretically utilize any carbon source. Earlier studies have produced P(3HB-co-3HP) from variable carbon sources such as gluconate/alanine [11], glycerol [12], fructose and soybean oil (only trace 3HP incorporation in the copolymer) [14]. This study further confirmed that multiple oil substrates can be utilized as sole carbon sources in P(3HB-co-3HP) production (Table 3). From oil substrates, hydrolyzed fatty acids and glycerol can be converted to acetyl-CoA for the 3HB and 3HP pathway (Figure 2). C. necator strains have a strong ability to hydrolyze oil substrates, as indicated in an earlier study [25]. In comparing the effects of oil substrates on the production of P(3HB-co-3HP), the group of olive oil had the best cell growth (Table 3), which was slightly higher than that of the soybean oil group (p > 0.05) and obviously higher than that of the palm oil group (p < 0.05). However, in consideration of the titer of P(3HB-co-3HP), the soybean oil group had the highest titer, which was obviously higher than that of the olive oil group (p < 0.05) and significantly higher than that of the palm oil group (p < 0.01). The high PHA content (around 60%, Table 3) majorly contributed to the high titer of the soybean oil group. These results indicate that a broader range of oil substrates can be utilized for P(3HB-co-3HP) fermentation, and are similar to the results of studies in being able to produce PHA from oil substrate by C. necator strains [25]."

Thus, this condition was chosen to cultivate C. necator ZL1 in a bioreactor to further investigate the scale-up results. The fed-batch fermentation significantly improved the cell growth and titer (CDW reached 6.08 g/L, titer reached 3.11 g/L at 72 h) compared with flask level fermentation (p < 0.01, Table 3). The 3HP molar fraction reached 32.25%, which was slightly higher than that of flask level fermentation (27.57%), but the difference was not obvious (p > 0.05). The molecular weight of fed-batch-level-produced P(3HB-co-3HP) was detected by GPC. The results showed that the Mw (weight-average molecular weight) reached 201,105 (Da), the Mn (number-average molecular weight) reached 105,845 (Da), and the Mw/Mn (molecular weight dispersion index, denotes the molecular weight distribution width of the polymer) was calculated as 1.9. The comparison of current P(3HB-co-3HP) studies is summarized in Table 4. Compared with the engineered E. coli strains, C. necator strains have the advantage of utilizing a broader range of substrates, as approved in this study in that multiple oil substrates can be utilized as sole carbon sources for P(3HB-co-3HP) fermentation. Among all the studies utilizing C. necator strains, this study showed the best titer and a reasonable 3HP molar fraction. Another advantage of the proposed method in this study comes from the efficient malonyl-CoA pathway: no specific supplementation (alanine by \u03b2-alanine pathway; VB12 by pduP) is needed, thus reducing the cost for industrial applications. The disadvantage of the proposed method is that the 3HP molar fraction cannot be regulated and increased, and this demands further studies to engineer a more robust and under-regulation malonyl-CoA pathway in the chassis strain. However, the bioreactor-scale fermentation in this study did not present a satisfactory biomass (maximum 6.08 g/L). One of the main bottlenecks was that the oil substrate was evenly fed during the fermentation process and the substrate\u2019s concentration was not properly maintained to further improve the biomass accumulation. Only three oil substrates and several induction levels were tested in this study, and further systematic process optimization and improvement are required to achieve satisfactory cell growth and P(3HB-co-3HP) production.\nBioengineering 2023, 10, 446 9 of 11"

Due to the increased efficiency of the malonyl-CoA pathway to supply 3HP, the 3HP molar fraction in P(3HB-co-3HP) was significantly increased (to 20\u201330 mol%) compared with the pioneering study [14]. However, when a higher induction level of arabinose was added in this study, the 3HP molar fraction was significantly decreased, indicating that the engineered malonyl-CoA pathway was not properly expressed in the high-induction condition. Compared with the \u03b2-alanine and pduP pathway [10\u201312], which achieved the production of P(3HB-co-3HP) with a high molar fraction (to 90 mol%), the malonyl-CoA pathway should be further investigated to improve its performance in the production of HP containing polyester. In addition, this study confirmed that oil substrates can be utilized as a sole carbon source in P(3HB-co-3HP) production through the malonyl-CoA pathway. The utilization of oil substrates is normally seen in industrial PHA production by C. necator strains [25], and the production of P(3HB-co-3HP) from oil substrates is cost-effective as no additional supplementation is demanded, as seen in the production of P(3HB-co-3HP) through the \u03b2alanine and pduP pathway [10\u201312]. The low-cost method of this study provided candidate techniques for tentative industrial applications. Although the production of P(3HB-co-3HP) by C. necator through the malonyl-CoA pathway has several advantages (broader carbon source, no expensive supplementation such as alanine and VB12), the strain and process demand further optimization in future studies: (1) testing a broader range of substrates in P(3HB-co-3HP), such as waste or recycled cooking oil; (2) developing the metabolic engineering to gain adjustable metabolic flux towards 3HB and 3HP (to regulate 3HP molar fraction); (3) the expanding of product streamlines by C. necator through the malonyl-CoA pathway, such as P3HP (natural 3HB flux should be depleted) and other copolymers containing the 3HP monomer; and (4) the development of a high-density fermentation process to improve the titer and reduce the unit cost.\nAuthor Contributions: M.L., W.L., T.Z. and H.Z., writing\u2014original draft preparation; K.G., D.F., F.L., C.X. and M.X., writing\u2014review and editing.
