    "abstractText": "Multidomain proteins can exhibit sophisticated functions based on cooperative interactions and allosteric regulation through spatial rearrangements of the multiple domains. This study explored the potential of using multidomain proteins as a basis for F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensors, focusing on protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) as a representative example. PDI, a wellstudied multidomain protein, undergoes redox-dependent conformational changes, enabling the exposure of a hydrophobic surface extending across the b\u2019 and a\u2019 domains that serves as the primary binding site for substrates. Taking advantage of the dynamic domain rearrangements of PDI, we developed FRET-based biosensors by fusing the b\u2019 and a\u2019 domains of thermophilic fungal PDI with fluorescent proteins as the FRET acceptor and donor, respectively. Both experimental and computational approaches were used to characterize FRET efficiency in different redox states. In vitro and in vivo evaluations demonstrated higher FRET efficiency of this biosensor in the oxidized form, reflecting the domain rearrangement and its responsiveness to intracellular redox environments. This novel approach of exploiting redox-dependent domain dynamics in multidomain proteins offers promising opportunities for designing innovative FRET-based biosensors with potential applications in studying cellular redox regulation and beyond.",

            "text": "Most proteins in nature consist of two or more domains resulting from the duplication and combination of genes in the genome. Domain multiplicity enables sophisticated protein functions based on cooperative interactions and allosteric regulation, often coupled with environmental sensing for homeostatic control [1,2]. These functions are exerted through spatial rearrangements of the multiple domains. These properties of multidomain proteins could provide the basis for designing F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensors, as exemplified by Chameleon, an engineered protein based on calmodulin for sensing calcium levels [3]. A group of proteins, the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family, is one of the most extensively studied multidomain proteins [4,5]. Approximately 20 PDI family proteins\nInt. J. Mol.

Sci. 2023, 24, 12865 2 of 11\nhave thus far been identified in humans, more than half of which contain more than one catalytically active or inactive thioredoxin-like domain. PDI, the representative protein of this family, consists of four thioredoxin-like domains, a, b, b\u2019, and a\u2019, and an acidic C-terminal extension [5\u20137]. The a and a\u2019 domains contain a cysteine pair within a WCGHCK active-site motif involved in thiol/disulfide exchange reactions, while the b and b\u2019 domains lack an active site motif. The accumulated experimental and computational data on PDI in humans or other organisms indicate that this protein undergoes redox-dependent conformational changes that are accompanied by the exposure of a hydrophobic surface that extends across the b\u2019 and a\u2019 domains and serves as the primary binding site for substrates [7\u201319]. The b\u2019 and a\u2019 domains are in contact in the reduced form of the a\u2019 domain active site, shielding the hydrophobic surface, and their contact is weakened upon oxidation of the active site. This has prompted single-molecule FRET measurements for characterizing the redox-dependent conformational dynamics of PDI. In this approach, the full-length human PDI is site-specifically labeled with a pair of FRET dyes via click chemistry [20,21]. Redox reactions play a crucial role not only in cellular metabolism but also in intracellular processes such as transcription, translation, and signal transduction [22\u201324]. Therefore, using biosensors to detect changes in the redox state within living cells can contribute to understanding cell health, stress response, and potentially uncovering mechanisms underlying diseases. Herein, we developed an alternative approach to design FRET-based biosensors exploiting the redox-dependent conformational changes in PDI. In this approach, we used the b\u2019 and a\u2019 domains of thermophilic fungal PDI, as a minimal unit exhibiting redox-dependent domain rearrangement, and fused the domains to fluorescent proteins as a FRET acceptor and donor. This enabled in vivo expression of the FRET probes for monitoring intracellular redox environments. To optimize the design of the FRET-based biosensor, we perform experimental and computational characterization of the redox-dependent conformational dynamics of PDI-b\u2019a\u2019."

Consistent with previous studies [11], the two domains underwent dynamic movements, changing positions with each other in the oxidized form (Figure 1A, Video S1A), whereas they stuck together and became one in the reduced form (Figure 1B, Video S1B). These results encouraged us to use PDI-b\u2019a\u2019 as a framework for designing FRET-based biosensors. To estimate the FRET efficiency in silico, we performed coarse-grained (CG) simulations of PDI-b\u2019a\u2019 fused to the fluorescent proteins CFP and YFP as a donor and acceptor, respectively. We attempted to employ the crystal structures of PDI-b\u2019a\u2019 as the initial structures for the simulation. In the crystal structures of thermophilic fungal PDI-b\u2019a\u2019, the crystallographically neighboring molecule hinders the potential domain\u2013domain interaction, rendering the domain arrangement open irrespective of the redox state [8,15]. In contrast, the b\u2019 and a\u2019 domains in the crystal structure of the reduced form of human PDI (PDB ID: 4EKZ [13]) adopt a closed conformation consistent with the experimental and computational data in solution. Hence, we employed the crystal structure of the oxidized form of thermophilic fungal PDI-b\u2019a\u2019 (PDB ID: 3WT2 [8]) to construct an initial model of the oxidized form. We also conducted homology modeling based on the crystal structure of the reduced form of human PDI to construct an initial model of the reduced form of thermophilic fungal PDI-b\u2019a\u2019. Using these structures, we constructed initial structures of YFP-PDI-b\u2019a\u2019-CFP fusion proteins, where YPet, a YFP variant, and Turquoise-GL, a CFP variant, were fused to the N-terminus and C-terminus of thermophilic fungal PDI-b\u2019a\u2019, respectively.

Under both reducing and oxidizing conditions, the FRET efficiency was attenuated by the circular permutations (Figure S1). Therefore, we adopted the original YFP-PDI-b\u2019a\u2019-CFP using YPet as the FRET probe for in-cell applications.\n2.3.

A series of fluorescent protein variants with an artificially introduced cysteine pair (such as roGFP, rxYFP, and Oba-Q) have been created to probe the redox status of a cell based on ratiometric imaging [26\u201328]. For the sensitive detection of intracellular redox changes against the background, single-molecule FRET-based approaches\nave been developed using a pair of fluorescent proteins connec ed via a redox sensing region derived fro the chloroplastic regulatory protein CP12 or the yeast transcription factor Yap1, which undergoes redox-dependent conformational change [29,30]. In either case, the disulfide formation in the redox-sensing region brings two fluorescent proteins into close spatial proximity, thereby enhancing FRET efficiency. In contrast, the FRET\nInt. J.

            "text": "In multidomain proteins, local perturbations such as ligand binding and site-directed mutation cause gross conformational changes accompanied by domain rearrangements, providing spectroscopic probes for monitoring intracellular environments as well as in vitro applications including drug screening [3,20,21,31\u201333]. Experimental and computational characterization of the conformational dynamics of multiple domains associated with fluorescence proteins is required to design effective biosensors. In this study, we employed CG simulations, which successfully predicted the redox-dependent change in FRET efficiency of the PDI-b\u2019a\u2019-based probe. This approach can be applied to designing new FRET biosensors based on other PDI family protein members that exhibit distinct redox potentials. Moreover, the redox potential of their active sites can be modulated via mutagenesis. However, it is generally difficult to predict the possible impacts of active site modification on domain\u2013domain interactions, as exemplified by the effect of the Cys-to-Ser mutation in the a\u2019 active site. Further liaison between experimentation and theory will be necessary to explore new vistas in the design of biosensing probes based on multidomain proteins."
