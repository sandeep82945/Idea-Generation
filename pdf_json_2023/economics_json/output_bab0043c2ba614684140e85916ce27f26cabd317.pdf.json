    "abstractText": "To achieve the Sustainable Development Goal\u2019s targets of universal health coverage (UHC) and poverty reduction, interventions are required that strengthen and harmonize both UHC and social protection. Vietnam is committed to achieving financial protection and over 90% of the general population has enrolled in its social health insurance (SHI) scheme. However, an estimated 63% of tuberculosis (TB)-affected households in Vietnam still face catastrophic costs and little is known about the optimal strategies to mitigate the costs of TB care for vulnerable families. This study assessed the acceptability of a social protection package containing cash transfers and SHI using individual interviews (n = 19) and focus group discussions (n = 3 groups). Interviews were analyzed through framework analysis. The study\u2019s main finding indicated that both conditional and unconditional cash transfers paired with SHI were acceptable, across six dimensions of acceptability. Cash transfers were considered beneficial for mitigating out-of-pocket expenditure, increasing TB treatment adherence, and improving mental health and general well-being, but the value provided was inadequate to fully alleviate the economic burden of the illness. The conditionality of the cash transfers was not viewed by participants as inappropriate, but it increased the workload of the TB program, which brought into question the feasibility of scale-up. SHI was viewed as a necessity by almost all participants, but people with TB questioned the quality of care received when utilizing it for auxiliary TB services. Access to multiple sources of social protection was deemed necessary to fully offset the costs of TB care. Additional research is needed to assess the impact of cash transfer interventions on health and economic outcomes in order to create an enabling policy environment for scale-up.

Vietnam is committed to achieving financial protection and over 90%\nof the general population has enrolled in its social health insurance (SHI) scheme. However,\nan estimated 63% of tuberculosis (TB)-affected households in Vietnam still face cata-\nstrophic costs and little is known about the optimal strategies to mitigate the costs of TB\ncare for vulnerable families. This study assessed the acceptability of a social protection\npackage containing cash transfers and SHI using individual interviews (n = 19) and focus\ngroup discussions (n = 3 groups). Interviews were analyzed through framework analysis.\nThe study\u2019s main finding indicated that both conditional and unconditional cash transfers\npaired with SHI were acceptable, across six dimensions of acceptability. Cash transfers\nwere considered beneficial for mitigating out-of-pocket expenditure, increasing TB treatment\nadherence, and improving mental health and general well-being, but the value provided was\ninadequate to fully alleviate the economic burden of the illness. The conditionality of the\ncash transfers was not viewed by participants as inappropriate, but it increased the workload\nof the TB program, which brought into question the feasibility of scale-up. SHI was viewed\nas a necessity by almost all participants, but people with TB questioned the quality of care\nreceived when utilizing it for auxiliary TB services. Access to multiple sources of social pro-\ntection was deemed necessary to fully offset the costs of TB care. Additional research is\nneeded to assess the impact of cash transfer interventions on health and economic out-\ncomes in order to create an enabling policy environment for scale-up.\nPLOS Global Public Health | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgph.0002439 December 6, 2023 1 / 20\nCitation: Forse R, Nguyen TT, Dam T, Vo LNQ, Codlin AJ, Caws M, et al.

However, the challenges of achieving these targets remain significant, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nVietnam ranks 10th among the world\u2019s highest TB burden countries, with 172,000 people\ndeveloping TB in 2020 and over 10,000 people dying from this preventable and curable disease [5]. Additionally, a national patient cost survey identified that 63% of TB-affected households experienced catastrophic costs, defined as having costs associated with TB care equivalent to more than 20% of their annual household income [6].\nCash transfers have emerged as a key social protection intervention to potentially improve\nhealth. They have been recommended as one means of expanding social protection in the WHO End TB strategy [7]. Establishing the optimal design of conditions placed on these transfers, if any, has been identified as a key research priority [8].\nCash transfers are the provision of money to vulnerable individuals; they can be distributed\nunconditionally or on the condition of a beneficiary participating a specific action, such as attendance at a medical appointment, adherence to a treatment plan, pick-up of nutritional supplements, periodic testing, or participation in vaccination [9,10]. Conditional cash transfers (CCTs) have been shown to generally increase adoption of targeted behaviors, increase use of health services and at times improve health outcomes [11]. Unconditional cash transfers (UCTs) have been shown to increase spending on household priorities, which often improves overall wellbeing, but direct impacts on health are not as evident [12].\nA systematic review found seven \u2018TB-specific\u2019 interventions aiming to improve treatment\noutcomes through cash transfers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) [13]. Of these, six were at least partially conditioned on clinic attendance or treatment completion. Evidence from the systematic review suggests that cash transfer interventions can offset the costs of TB care in LMICs, and act as a poverty-reduction measure. Cash transfers may also improve clinical outcomes for people with TB, although this finding is based on a single randomized control trial [14]. To our knowledge, there are currently no published studies on cash transfers to mitigate the costs of TB in the Vietnamese context.\nAny cash transfer intervention in Vietnam should integrate within the context of the\nnational social security system. Since 1989, Vietnam has been progressing towards universal health coverage (UHC) through a government-provided Social Health Insurance (SHI) scheme. By 2019, over 90% of the population had been enrolled in SHI [15,16]. From the patient-perspective at the time of data collection of this study, most TB diagnostic evaluations, healthcare consultations and medications in the public sector were provided nominally freeof-charge through Vietnam\u2019s National TB Programme (NTP) without requiring proof of SHI enrollment. Starting in mid-2022, after completion of data collection on this study, public health facilities at the secondary care level have been made eligible to receive reimbursements from SHI for TB treatment [17]. The effects of this change to the financing model for TB care in Vietnam have yet to be studied.\nIn parallel to progress made towards UHC, Vietnam\u2019s NTP has begun to address the\nimpoverishing effects of TB, including expansion of access to social protection. They created the Patients Support to Fight TB (PASTB) fund, a national financial risk reduction charity fund to purchase SHI for poor individuals without SHI coverage at the start of their TB\nPLOS Global Public Health | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgph.0002439 December 6, 2023 2 / 20\nnot prevent identification of individuals. During the informed consent process, we guaranteed anonymity to our study participants. For these reasons, we have not included any of the interview transcripts from the 15 key informant interviews with these TB staff in the data repository. These data may be shared upon reasonable request by the corresponding author.\nFunding: The European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [grant agreement No 733174] generously funded the IMPACT-TB in Vietnam and Nepal project and this work. The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.\nCompeting interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\ntreatment and to provide limited cash transfers [18]. Additionally, donor agencies and local partners are collaborating with the NTP to pilot the delivery of cash transfers and SHI enrollment and/or cash transfers for people with TB in Vietnam [19\u201321].\nAcceptability is a key consideration for the design, delivery and evaluation of complex interventions to improve health outcomes [22,23]. For an intervention to be successful, it requires both healthcare providers and beneficiaries to find it acceptable [24]. If healthcare providers do not find an intervention to be acceptable, then it may not be delivered as designed, or the quality of service delivery may diminish [25]. For beneficiaries of an intervention, low acceptability can negatively impact perceived quality of care, uptake, adherence, and effectiveness [26,27].\nHowever, in the scientific literature, a standardized definition of acceptability has not been\napplied, and often behavioral indicators, such as dropout rates, have been used as measurements of acceptability [28]. To systematically develop a common understanding of acceptability, Sekhon et al. developed a Theoretical Framework of Acceptability (TFA). This framework defines acceptability as a multi-dimensional construct across three temporal perspectives, and provides a clear conceptual definition [29].\nAs the provision of cash transfers and SHI for TB is being piloted and evaluated in Vietnam\nand other LMICs, the acceptability of these forms of social protection among health care providers and beneficiaries has not yet been rigorously evaluated, yet their acceptability is a necessary (albeit insufficient) condition for evaluating their effectiveness and scalability [29].\nThis study was embedded within an intervention that combined cash transfers with SHI for\npeople with drug-susceptible TB in Vietnam, called the \u2018cash transfer UHC+ intervention.\u2019 It aimed to assess the multifaceted components of acceptability of this intervention, contribute to policy debates on conditionality of cash transfers and contextualize these findings within Vietnam and other LMICs."

It consisted of two components: the provision of either CCT or UCT to eligible people with drug-susceptible TB in four districts of Ho Chi Minh City and the purchase of SHI for all TB-affected households who did not have active coverage.\nEligible individuals had pulmonary drug-susceptible TB, and at the time of treatment initiation were identified as being economically vulnerable by holding government poverty registration, lacking SHI, and being unemployed or informally employed. Eligibility was assessed by healthcare providers working within District TB Units (DTUs). For both the CCT and UCT groups, the value of the cash transfer was 500,000 Vietnamese Dong (VND) (~21.50 USD, OANDA.com) per month and it was provided for six months. For UCTs, cash was distributed by program staff at the participant\u2019s home or another convenient location, such as a coffee shop.\nThe conditions that needed to be met for beneficiaries to obtain the CCT included attend-\ning a monthly examination at a DTU, along with a demonstration that at least 85% of medications provided at the last appointment were no longer in the blister packs, as a proxy measure of treatment adherence. The cash transfer was provided by the DTU staff during a monthly appointment (See Table 2)."

The components in combination were mostly viewed as complementary, because it took time to register for SHI and the cash was needed most acutely in the first months of TB treatment. If either benefit was to be prioritized, then in the perspective of community members and the majority of TB doctors from the district- to national-level, SHI should be prioritized over cash.\nAcross all groups of participants, in both the pre-and post-intervention interviews, SHI was\nviewed as standard of care, a national priority, and a necessity. One doctor summed up this policy objective by saying, \u2018The purchase of health insurance is something that every citizen must aim for, not only for TB patients (Pre-7-M, Provincial-level TB staff).\u2019 While a beneficiary said, \u2018We have to admit that health insurance is very necessary. For older people, disease can come at any time\u2019 (Interview Post-11-F, CCT beneficiary). Reasons for not purchasing SHI prior to TB diagnosis included being unable to afford it for the entire household and low perceived risk of not having insurance. \u2018I thought since I am still young, I don\u2019t need it\u2019 (Post11-M, CCT beneficiary).\nPost-intervention interviews about the cash transfers described them as unbelievable, and almost too good to be true. Participant 1 (Female): \u2018I told my neighbor [about the cash transfer] but she didn\u2019t believe that we received money. She said that treatment was free, but I said I also received money. She said I lied. Several times when I was given support [at my home], she was staring at us.\u2019 Participant 2 (Male): \u2018In my department at work, they don\u2019t believe me\u2019 (Post-12, UCT beneficiaries).\nAll participants were asked who should be eligible to receive a cash transfer intervention. Most participants believed that the support should be targeted towards the poor, with those in the most need prioritized first. Additional target groups viewed as deserving of financial support included the uninsured, internal migrants, those with chronic illnesses, the elderly, and those without official documentation, as they would be unable to obtain stable jobs. Several district-level doctors mentioned excluding those who already had access to other social protection mechanisms, such as those who receive monetary support through the Fund for Victims of Agent Orange.\nCash provision was deemed acceptable by every category of participant when used to sup-\nport nutrition or food. Only two participants, both working for the TB program, were unconcerned about how cash was spent by people with TB. After using cash for nutritional support, TB staff and doctors tended to express positive feelings towards cash being used to pay for travel. However, people with TB tended to prioritize vitamin supplementation during TB care (See S3 File\u2014Acceptable Uses of Cash)."

Beneficiaries viewed cash as a way to defray the direct costs of treatment and direct, non-medical costs such as travel. Several doctors and program staff viewed them as a way to enable beneficiaries to purchase more expensive, nutritious foods such as fruit, allow them to buy medications not covered by the TB program, or to pay down debts.\nIn the opinions of a district and a provincial-level TB doctor, the cash allowed individuals\nwith TB to rest and focus on recovery. Cash was identified as one component of a care model to improve treatment and reduce stigma.\n\u2018The most important thing is the spiritual support; our [the intervention\u2019s] support will make them feel that they are cared for and receive the additional care from other people.\nPLOS Global Public Health | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgph.0002439 December 6, 2023 8 / 20\nThey feel moved and happy when they are cared for. . . .The support makes them feel that there is no discrimination against them.

When we are with them. . . we sit with them and our action\u2014our care for them through the cash support\u2014is the way to reduce stigma.\u2019 (Post-9-F, Program staff)\nOne beneficiary stated that the cash transfer, \u2018helped me to understand and appreciate my\nlife.\u2019 (Post-11-F, CCT beneficiary) TB doctors and program staff also described cash as improving attitudes about TB treatment and helping beneficiaries, who were struggling through treatment, feel more content while seeking healthcare.\n\u2018Cash transfers help our patients feel happy and we are happy when our patients are happy, because sometimes they say, \u201cWith this support, I will buy more food for my family, or I will buy this or that\u201d. . . . [With the cash,] they pay more attention to their health; they buy tonics and take care of their health better. They confidently go for health examinations and spend more on themselves.\u2019 (Post-10-F, Program staff)\nWhile describing benefits of cash transfers, the specific amount of cash provided in the intervention was considered by all beneficiaries as being insufficient. All participants were asked how much money should be provided per month and the average amount was 2.5 million VND per month (~107 USD, OANDA.com), which was five times more than the amount provided by the intervention. Beneficiaries expressed gratitude for receiving any money and were hesitant to comment negatively on the support package, but they felt that the value of the cash transfer was insufficient to cover their food costs or additional medication. Some participants stated that any amount of cash was better than nothing, but one respondent made it clear that even though there was need, \u2018Patients don\u2019t dare to ask for more.\u2019 (Interview Post12-M, UCT beneficiary).\nThe primary utility of SHI for beneficiaries was seen as reducing out-of-pocket expenditure\nduring TB treatment. Staff of the TB program felt that SHI was often undervalued by beneficiaries, since TB medication was largely provided free-of-charge through the NTP. But both beneficiaries and doctors identified coverage of costs for TB comorbidities as a specific benefit of SHI. Health insurance was viewed as expanding access to care, thus improving TB care, and reducing out-ofpocket expenditure. Doctors, program staff and beneficiaries described the ways SHI improved the beneficiary\u2019s mental health, a person\u2019s overall sense of security and reduced stress.\nThe benefits of SHI were described as allowing people with TB to focus on their care and\nrecovery. \u2018Mentally, if they get health insurance, they are not worried about their disease anymore and do not have to worry about treatment costs as they have health insurance as their amulet. They don\u2019t have to worry and can focus on other things such as their economic situation and their family.\u2019 (Pre-2-M, District-level TB doctor).\nHowever, beneficiaries in the post-intervention interviews described SHI enrollment and\nutilization challenges. A small proportion of beneficiaries who were eligible for SHI enrollment, were unable to register for SHI since they did not possess the correct official documentation, or the registration process took more than 30 days. Additionally, when beneficiaries described their experiences using SHI when accessing auxiliary TB care and non-TB care, they felt that the care provided to those who paid out-of-pocket was superior to the care received when using SHI. Five UCT beneficiaries in a FGD believed that they received care from \u2018junior doctors\u2019 when using SHI, not more senior clinicians (Post-12, UCT beneficiaries). Negative perceptions of services provided under SHI were described. One beneficiary said, \u2018Seeking health care with health insurance is not as pleasant as seeking health care without using it. It\u2019s\nPLOS Global Public Health | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgph.0002439 December 6, 2023 9 / 20\nslower. Those who don\u2019t use health insurance are prioritized.\u2019 (Post-5-F, Beneficiary) These challenges limited beneficiaries\u2019 belief that the intervention would support them during care or reduce their TB-related expenditure."

None of the participants opposed the distribution of cash outright. However, many expressed reservations with the provision of cash.\nSeveral TB doctors were concerned with how the money would be spent. One said, \u2018Money\nis the motivation for them to follow the treatment and we hope that the money will turn into food or something to improve their health.\u2019 (Pre-7-M, Provincial-level TB staff)\nFive categories of reservations were identified in the interviews. The first was that beneficia-\nries would obtain funding from another government agency along with the funds reserved for people with TB. The second was that cash could be misappropriated for lottery tickets, heroin, or other purposes not contributing to the alleviation of the socioeconomic burdens of TB. The third was that cash transfer had the potential to be socially divisive, create groups of beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries, cause conflict between doctors and patients, and increase the complaints fielded by the doctors. The fourth was that the existing funding sources could not sustain a cash transfer program and future stoppage of payments would disrupt treatment adherence. Lastly, TB doctors expressed concerns about \u2018dependency.\u2019 They were concerned that the cash would cause beneficiaries to become too reliant on the services of the TB program, causing them to disengage with their treatment and increase the workload of the DTU. \u2018When we offer support, the patients shall become dependent. It means that while some patients understand and obey the treatment plan, the others rely on us as they think, \u201cI do not care, it is covered by the program.\u201d\u2018 (Post-2-F, District-level TB doctor)\nDependency was also a concern for people with TB. In a post-intervention FGD, beneficiaries suggested that instead of providing small monthly cash transfers, they would prefer access to credit. They saw their only options for obtaining credit outside of their personal networks as coming from the Capital Aid for Employment of the Poor Microfinance Institution or from predatory lending agencies. These funds were seen as difficult to obtain, while loans from the black-market had high interest rates, repayment plans that were difficult or impossible to meet, and the inability to repay loans from the black-market had dire consequences. Beneficiaries specifically suggested that they requested loans up to 10 million VND (~428 USD, OANDA.com), and they should be provided without requiring any collateral as security for the loan. This suggestion to provide credit instead of cash aligned strongly with their fear of dependency. Beneficiaries expressed an unease with receiving a gift of cash in case it made them indebted to the state, a non-governmental organization or another entity. Both TB doctors and beneficiaries had the same desire\u2013for people with TB to remain independent, take accountability for their own treatment, not allow the cash transfer UHC+ intervention to replace their intrinsic motivation to get well, and help provide for the needs of their families."

And it does not impact them much; we only request them to return once per month.\u2019 (Post-9-F, Program staff).\nFor the health system, the added burden of monitoring the conditions was perceived to\nimprove the quality of TB care at the DTU and to bolster TB treatment adherence among beneficiaries. Speaking about a CCT participant, one TB doctor noted:\n\u2018He was eligible for the nutritional [cash transfer] and health insurance support from the program. After 2 months of treatment monitored by the DTU, he returned home for the Lunar New Year Festival. Then he stopped treatment and we only noticed this after he stopped for almost 2 months. This was detected thanks to the intervention as he also didn\u2019t come to receive the support money. After checking all the documents, we found out that he had stopped treatment. The TB officer in the ward then contacted the patient to continue the treatment.\u2019 (Post-2-F, District-level TB doctor)\nEven with the perceived improvements in treatment adherence brought about by the condi-\ntions, CCTs were viewed by the majority of the district-level health staff as overly burdensome to monitor, outside their remit, and impossible to scale-up. One doctor in charge of a district where program staff distributed CCT made his opinion clear about the possibility of administering a CCT program in the future. \u2018If there are one or two patients, it\u2019s okay. But there are more than 50 patients. We don\u2019t have enough time to check all [the conditions]. What nonsense! . . . The salary paid by the state does not cover this extra job, the structure of the health examination service does not include this work.\u2019 (Post-3-M, District-level TB doctor)\nProgram staff also felt that CCTs took too much time, effort and cost to administer, com-\npared to UCTs. \u2018We have to travel a lot, from this place to that other place and we need time to talk and encourage the patients. It takes half an hour for some patients and even one hour for others. . . We are very busy, sometimes we have to travel from morning to afternoon.\u2019 (Post9-F, Program staff)"

            "heading": "Discussion",
            "text": "Across six interconnected acceptability constructs, cash transfers were broadly accepted, for both CCT and UCT. SHI was perceived as having longer-term benefits, such as improving and expanding TB care and reducing out-of-pocket expenditure. From a health system perspective, if limited funding is available and only one benefit could be supported, SHI should be given priority since it is viewed as standard of care in Vietnam. However, the cash transfer was viewed as complementary to SHI and conveying material and \u2018spiritual\u2019 benefits to reduce stigma and discrimination during TB care; therefore, from a social protection perspective, there is support for cash transfer UHC+ interventions. Cash was viewed as a means to increase contact between the healthcare provider and the person with TB, improve the patient-provider partnership and help the person with TB recover a full sense of self.\nHowever, the value of the cash transfer was insufficient to offset the full costs of TB care,\nand there were widespread concerns both about the ways the money could be spent and generating a sense of \u2018dependency\u2019 among beneficiaries. The conditionality of CCTs was not perceived negatively, but was described as a transaction between the person with TB and provider, whereby cash was exchanged for TB treatment adherence. However, UCT beneficiaries understood this transaction in a similar way to CCT beneficiaries, without the added burden of meeting the conditions to receive payment. While still acceptable, CCTs were perceived as being overly burdensome to administer by district-level doctors in the TB program and program staff.\nA recent systematic review synthesizing qualitative evidence on experiences of cash trans-\nfers to improve health outcomes showed that cash transfers were perceived to produce positive personal and social outcomes, enhance empowerment, increase hope, and improve social cohesion. It also found that interactions with the cash transfer program impacted the acceptability of the intervention [35]. Cash transfer programs in other settings were acceptable when stakeholders held positive perceptions of the impact of a program, they promoted community participation and reduced social division [36\u201338]. This study supported these findings from the literature by showing that affective attitude and perceived effectiveness played a large role in the acceptability of a cash transfer UHC+ intervention, and that stakeholders worried about creating discontent among non-beneficiaries when providing the cash transfers.\nThe conditionality of cash transfers has been a longstanding subject of policy debate in\nterms of its effectiveness, acceptability, and ethicality [39\u201345]. Conditionality has been found to be acceptable when it is perceived as fair and as a proxy measurement for a positive outcome, such as achievement or merit. However, conditioning a cash transfer based on access to care and treatment adherence has been flagged as potentially impractical and unethical [46]. Questions regarding the ethicality of the conditionality of cash transfers persist, specifically in regards to respect for persons, fairness and unintended negative consequences. Ethicists have described conditionality as \u2018ethical\u2019 in the design phase of an intervention if it 1) increases the likelihood of bettering a health outcome; 2) takes into account risks and burden imposed; 3) assesses the willingness and resistance to meeting program conditions; 4) establishes conditions that are attainable; and 5) considers the indirect impacts that the conditionality may have on the beneficiaries [45]. This study reveals that during the design phase of the intervention, the conditionality of the CCT satisfied those ethical considerations. However, the relative\nPLOS Global Public Health | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgph.0002439 December 6, 2023 12 / 20\ngains brought about by the conditionality should be quantified. Future studies should investigate the role of conditionality on improving TB treatment outcomes, reducing catastrophic cost incurrence for TB-affected households, and the burden of administering conditions on the health system.\nWithin this study, cash transfers were found to be less of a priority for almost all participants than the provision of SHI. This is perhaps unsurprising from the health system\u2019s perspective in Vietnam since SHI coverage is national policy and 90% of the general population has already been enrolled [16]. These findings may also align with the hesitancy expressed in other settings to apply for cash transfer benefits due to a distrust in government, or a social desirability bias to not appear \u2018lazy\u2019 [47\u201349].\nWhile SHI was preferred over cash transfers, participants discussed barriers to SHI enroll-\nment and utilization challenges. A prior study from Vietnam has shown that \u2018money changing hands\u2019 enhanced the contractual patient-provider relationship and perceived quality of care [50]. Nonetheless, utilization of SHI needs to be addressed in order to maximize its benefits, and truly achieve UHC. Additionally, data from a longitudinal patient cost survey conducted in Ho Chi Minh City showed that income loss and household expenditure for TB were highest during the intensive phase of drug-susceptible TB treatment, typically in the first two months [51]. This suggests that if SHI provision were to be prioritized over cash as a social protection mechanism for TB in Vietnam, there is still a need for a policy availing access to direct financial support during the first months of TB care for those who enter treatment uninsured.\nSocial protection interventions solely providing cash transfers in LMICs are unlikely to\nhave adequate resources to provide a sufficient value to mitigate catastrophic costs from TB [52]. Cash transfers are generally perceived as necessary and helpful, but often only sufficient to cover some immediate needs and not always to achieve the outcomes of the program [35]. For this reason, cash transfer models combining multiple forms of social protection are required. In this study, acceptability of the cash transfer declined when it was perceived as insufficient to defray the costs of TB care. Beneficiaries requested access to other forms of social protection, such as low- or no-interest loans. Microcredit institutions have the potential to become self-sustaining, but they tend to target those who are able to pay back the loans, they have been shown to increase indebtedness, require infrastructure to track and seek repayment, and their success hinges on the management capacity of the microcredit institution [53]. While microcredit may improve general economic wellbeing, this type of intervention has not yet been proven to improve TB outcomes, and the challenges with designing and implementing a policy for TB-affected households remain significant, while protecting borrowers from predatory lenders [46].\nLayering multiple forms of social protection and increasing access to national schemes for\nlong-term sick leave and sickness insurance, should be considered in the design of programs to ensure that support is adequate. Within the Vietnamese context, this will require multisectoral collaboration with entities outside of the traditional health-care infrastructure including the Ministry of Labor Invalids and Social Affairs (MOLISA). In addition, there are often unaddressed psychosocial needs during TB care that require social support [54\u201360]. Social support during TB care has been shown to reduce stress and assist in the recovery process [61,62]. Although this intervention was not specifically designed as a \u2018cash plus care\u2019 model, providing tailored psychosocial support, the regular engagement with and counselling provided by program staff was viewed as a benefit and core component of the acceptability of the intervention [63].\nThe cash transfer UHC+ intervention evaluated in this study was designed to investigate\nsupport with similar components to those provided by the government\u2019s PASTB fund. Vietnam is one of the first LMICs to create a nationally-available social protection fund specifically\nPLOS Global Public Health | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgph.0002439 December 6, 2023 13 / 20\ndedicated for people with drug-susceptible TB to reimburse the purchase of SHI and provide cash transfers [18]. PASTB aligns with the UHC goals of extending services to non-covered people and reducing cost sharing and fees [64]. This research on cash transfer acceptability can inform the design of social protection schemes distributed by PASTB and similar mechanisms in other countries. It indicates that it is broadly acceptable for SHI reimbursement to remain the priority of the PASTB fund. However, this study also pointed to the need for optimization of existing SHI services and additional staffing support for overburdened healthcare workers when delivering social protection. One potential way to complete this is through better integration of social workers within the health system and the scale-up of PASTB.\nTo monitor progress in achieving the WHO End TB Strategy target of \u2018No TB affected fam-\nilies experiencing catastrophic costs due to TB\u2019, the proportion of people with TB who experience catastrophic costs are published annually in WHO\u2019s Global TB Report for selected countries, [3,65]. Now that baseline measurements have been established in some countries, research activities should focus on evaluating interventions to reduce or mitigate catastrophic costs [66]."

            "text": "The TFA developed by Sekhon and colleagues is becoming widely cited, primarily because it is the first attempt to systematically develop a common understanding of the concept of acceptability [29]. A smaller number of studies have utilized the TFA in qualitative research to structure the presentation of results [67\u201369].\nWhen designing topic guides and conducting interviews, all seven components of the TFA\nwere included [29]. (See S2 File) However, within our qualitative data, four of the constructs (affective attitude, perceived effectiveness, ethicality and burden) provided the richest insights. Intervention coherence and opportunity costs underpinned the acceptability of the intervention and yielded expected insights.\nIn this study, all beneficiaries and district-level TB and program staff who implemented the\nintervention were able to accurately describe the services provided, the schedule and the conditions required to receive the CT. We believe this was facilitated by clear standard operating procedures, robust data systems, responsive implementers, and a strong understanding of the socioeconomic vulnerability for the population of people with TB. In this case, high intervention coherence undergirded the high acceptability. However, poor intervention coherence caused by a lack of understanding about the way an intervention has been designed to function, poor training, or a general misunderstanding of the theory of change underpinning an intervention, has great potential to reduce its acceptability. Our study did not find a high opportunity cost associated with participating with the intervention. This was mostly due to the design of the intervention, and it being integrated into existing care processes.\nResearchers conducting qualitative research may find that not all of the TFA constructs are\nappropriate for all interventions, as was found during the development of the quantitative TFA Questionnaire [27]. The TFA defines self-efficacy as \u201cthe participants confidence that they could perform the behaviors to participate in the intervention.\u201d In our study, this was the definition used to develop topic guides related to this construct, and it was felt from the outset that this construct was more applicable to behavior change interventions. Upon further reflection, additional questions could have been asked to better assess if the cash transfers UHC + intervention improved beneficiaries\u2019 beliefs that they could complete TB treatment according to programmatic guidelines. When utilizing the TFA and developing questions related to self-efficacy, researchers should consider specifying the behaviors required to participate in an\nPLOS Global Public Health | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgph.0002439 December 6, 2023 14 / 20\nintervention, or modify the definition of self-efficacy to the participants belief that they can perform the behaviors required to achieve the intervention\u2019s intended outcome."

However, more research is needed to understand the impact of these cash transfers on health and economic outcomes and their cost effectiveness in order to create an enabling policy environment for the scale-up of similar interventions nationally and internationally."
