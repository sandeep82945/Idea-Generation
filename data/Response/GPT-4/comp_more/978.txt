Exploring Continuous and Multi-Dimensional Sensitive Attributes: The current study focuses on binary and categorical sensitive attributes (e.g., gender, ethnicity). Future research could extend this approach to handle continuous and multi-dimensional sensitive attributes, such as socio-economic status or a combination of age, location, and education level. This would increase the model's applicability to a wider range of fairness scenarios and provide a more nuanced understanding of bias in text classification.

Adapting the Approach to Other NLP Tasks: While this study concentrates on text classification, the underlying method could be adapted and tested on other NLP tasks such as machine translation, sentiment analysis, and text generation. Investigating how Wasserstein fairness constraints affect model performance and bias mitigation in these contexts would be a valuable extension.

Investigating the Impact of Different Data Augmentation Techniques: The paper discusses transferring knowledge from one dataset to another to train the demonic model when sensitive attributes are not available. Future research could explore how different data augmentation techniques or synthetic data generation impact the effectiveness of this transfer learning approach, especially in scenarios with scarce or imbalanced data regarding sensitive attributes.

Development of Advanced Regularization Techniques: The use of Wasserstein distance as a regularization term to enforce fairness is innovative. Further research could explore the development of more advanced regularization techniques that might better capture the complex nature of bias and fairness in high-dimensional space. For instance, incorporating dynamic weighting of the regularization term based on the model's performance during training could offer a more refined balance between accuracy and fairness.

Fairness in Federated Learning Settings: Considering the increasing interest in privacy-preserving machine learning approaches, such as federated learning, future work could explore how the proposed method could be adapted for scenarios where data cannot be centralized due to privacy concerns. This would involve developing strategies to apply Wasserstein-based fairness constraints in a distributed manner, ensuring that fairness is maintained across multiple decentralized datasets without compromising individual privacy.
