In this study, we consider employing a virtual two-qubit gate (VTQG) as an error suppression technique. The VTQG enables a non-local operation between a pair of distant qubits using only single qubit gates and projective measurements.

In our experiments, we have observed one order of magnitude improvement in accuracy for the quantum simulation of the transverse-field Ising model with 8 qubits.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nQubit connectivity has a large impact on the performance of near term quantum computers. For instance, on a superconducting quantum device, an application of a two-qubit gate is limited on nearest-neighboring qubits, necessitating the SWAP gates for interactions between distant qubits. The SWAP gate is constructed by the concatenation of three CNOT gates. However, two-qubit gate operations are typically more prone to noise than single-qubit operations, thus, the requirement of the additional SWAP gates leads to significant reduction in the performance of the quantum device.\nIn this study, to suppress the errors due to the additional SWAP gates for a two-qubit gate operation between a pair of distant qubits, we have employed a virtual two-qubit gate (VTQG) proposed by Mitarai and Fuji [1]. The original motivation behind the VTQG is to simulate a large quantum circuit with a small-scale quantum computer [1], and in this context, similar studies have been performed [2\u20136].\nHere, we have focused on the property that the VTQG allows a two-qubit gate between an arbitrary pair of qubits. This non-local operation reduces the number of additional SWAP gates since the communication between distant qubits otherwise requires a number of SWAP operations. In this sense, we believe that the VTQG can be used as an error suppression technique. In this study, we have demonstrated performance improvement of the quantum simulation of the transverse-field Ising model by implementing the VTQG on an IBM quantum device. The obtained results show that the VTQG can be a solid tool for suppressing errors.\nFurthermore, we have combined the VTQG with a pulse-efficient transpilation method [7\u201312]. This pulseefficient transpilation allows the reduction of the gate\n\u2217 Takahiro.Yamamoto3@ibm.com \u2020 Ryutaro.Ohira@ibm.com\nexecution time as well as the number of the two-qubit gate operations. As demonstrated in the previous works [7\u201312], an enhancement of the performance of the quantum device can be expected."

We run the circuits with up to 8 qubits, which are highlited in orange in Fig. 1(c). The average errors of a singlequbit gate and a CNOT gate applied to the 8 qubits are 0.03% and 0.87%, respectively. We kept records of the device property provided by IBM and took the average of them. C. Virtual two-qubit gate Depending on the qubit connectivity, the additional SWAP gates are required to apply a two-qubit operation between a pair of distant qubits. For instance, when we run the quantum circuit given in Fig. 1(a) using a qubit layout shown in Fig. 1(c), we apply 6 additional SWAP gates to apply an RZZ to the first qubit (Q0) and the 8th qubit (Q7) as shown in Fig. 1(b). However, the SWAP gate requires three CNOT gates, which are typically noisier than single-qubit operations. Therefore, as the problem size increases, the performance of the quantum device is significantly reduced due to the noisy SWAP gates.\nWe have replaced the RZZ(\u03b8) applied between the first qubit (Q0) and the Nth qubit (QN\u22121) with a VTQG, which can be decomposed as [1]:\nS(ei \u03b82Z0\u2297ZN\u22121) = cos2 \u03b8 2 S(I \u2297 I) + sin2 \u03b8 2 S(Z0 \u2297 ZN\u22121)\n+ 1\n8 cos\n\u03b8 2 sin \u03b8 2 \u2211 \u03b10,\u03b1N\u22121\u2208{1,\u22121} \u03b10\u03b1N\u22121[S((I + \u03b10Z0)\u2297 (I + i\u03b1N\u22121ZN\u22121)) + S((I + i\u03b10Z0)\u2297 (I + \u03b1N\u22121ZN\u22121))].\n(3)\nHere S is a superoperator, where a unitary operation U onto a state represented by density matrix \u03c1 is denoted as S(U)\u03c1 = U\u03c1U\u2020. The operations S(I + \u03b1Z) and S(I + i\u03b1Z) for \u03b1 \u2208 {1,\u22121} can be implemented by projective measurement on the Z basis and single-qubit rotation about the Z axis, respectively. We show a set of the quantum circuits for simulating the dynamics of the Ising model Hamiltonian using a VTQG applied between Q0 and Q3 in Fig. 2. The RZZ(\u03b8) gate is implemented using the reset operations and the single qubit operations. Other terms in Eq. (3) can be implemented in similar fashions, either by flipping the sign of the single-qubit rotation about the Z axis or exchanging Q0 and Q3.\nThe quantum circuits for implementing S(I \u00b1 Z) can be further simplified. We can remove the single-qubit rotation about the X axis proceeding the reset operation\nand classically calculate the probability\nTr ( \u03c1 I + Z\n2\n) = cos2(\u03b2), (4)\nwhere \u03b2 is the rotation angle. If the controlled qubit is in either |0\u3009 or |1\u3009, an RZZ(\u03b8) gate simply works as an RZ(\u03b8) gate on the target qubit. Therefore, further simplification of the circuit shown in Figs. 2 (c) and (d) can be realized as shown in Fig. 3."

A pulse-efficient transpilaiton method enables a reduction in the number of two-qubit gates and the duration\n3\nof their execution time, resulting in the better performance [7\u201312]. Normally, an RZZ(\u03b8) gate is implemented on quantum hardware using the decomposition shown in Fig. 4(a), where two CNOT gates are employed. By applying the pulse-efficient transpilaiton, an RZZ(\u03b8) gate can be decomposed into a hardware-native RZX(\u03b8) gate as shown in Fig. 4(b)."

            "text": "In the experiment, we set parameters h = 0.786, J = 0.787, and dt = 0.5, respectively. We perform the experiments with a single Trotter step. In each experiment, we prepare three quantum circuits: (1) an original quantum circuit without any error suppression techniques, (2) a quantum circuit with a VTQG applied to the first qubit (Q0) and the Nth qubit (QN\u22121), (3) a quantum circuit with a VTQG and pulse-efficient transpilation.\nIn Fig. 5, the obtained results using a single Trotter step are given for N = 4, 6 and 8 qubits. The y-axis represents the magnetization, which is defined as\u221a\n\u3008\u03c3x\u30092 + \u3008\u03c3y\u30092 + \u3008\u03c3z\u30092. (5)\nHere, each component is given as \u3008\u03c3j\u3009 = \u2211n\u22121 i=0 \u3008\u03c3j\u3009i /n, where j = x, y, z. We also show the noiseless result, which is calculated using the statevector simulator in Qiskit [13].\nWe perform each experiment with 8192 shots. We also repeat each experiment 20 times and average over the 20 obtained results. The error bars given in Fig. 5 correspond to the standard deviation over these 20 instances.\nWe do not observe an improvement between the results with and without the VTQG for 4-qubit experiments while the performance improvement is observed for 6- and 8-qubit experiments. The difference can be explained by the number of SWAP gates required to apply a two-qubit gate between Q0 and QN\u22121. We observe further improvement of the results between the experiments performed with quantum circuits with and without a pulse transplation method. This enhancement can be attributed to the reduction of the number of two-qubit gate operations and the overall gate execution time."

            "text": "One challenge of the application of the VTQG is the large overheads for its implementation. As the number of the VTQGs increases, the overheads for implementing the VTQG grows exponentially. Each VTQG requires execution of 10 circuits, hence, the number of circuits is 10m for m VTQGs. In fact, 100 quantum circuits are required to perform the experiments with two Trotter steps described in section III.\nA recent study, however, has shown that mid-circuit measurement enables an efficient implementation [14]. In Fig. 6, we show an implementation of S((I + iZ0) \u2297 (I \u00b1ZN\u22121)) terms of a VTQG for an RZZ(\u03b8) gate using mid-circuit measurements, reset operations, and classical feedback. This implementation reduces the growth of the circuit to be executed from O(10m) to O(6m). Although we have not performed the experimental implementation using dynamic circuits in this study, mid-circuit measurement and the conditional operations based on the output of mid-circuit measurement are commonly used techniques [15, 16]. Therefore, this implementation scheme is feasible with the current level of quantum technologies.\nFurther reduction of errors may be achieved by adding additional different error suppression techniques. For in-\n4\nstance, dynamical decoupling is used to achieve better qubit coherence [17, 18]. Pauli twirling can also be useful to suppress the coherent errors on a quantum device [19, 20]. Furthermore, a scalable Hamiltonian simulation can be expected by combining a series of error suppres-\nsion techniques with an error mitigation method [21\u201324], which has been demonstrated in Ref [10]."

            "text": "We have employed a virtual two-qubit gate (VTQG) as an error suppression technique for digital quantum simulation of the transverse-field Ising model to suppress the errors. The obtained results demonstrate that the VTQG can be used as a solid technique to suppress errors due to additional SWAP gates for the communication between distant qubits. Additionally, a further enhancement of the performance is observed by combining the VTQG with a pulse-efficient transpilation method."
