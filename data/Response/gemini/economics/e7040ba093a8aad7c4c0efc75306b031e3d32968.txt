1. **Investigate the cost-effectiveness of different screening strategies for breast cancer.** This could involve comparing the costs of different screening methods, such as mammography, ultrasound, and MRI, to the benefits of early detection and treatment.
2. **Develop a model to predict the stage of breast cancer at diagnosis.** This could help to identify women who are at high risk of developing advanced-stage breast cancer and to target them for more aggressive screening and treatment.
3. **Evaluate the impact of new treatments on the cost of breast cancer care.** This could help to inform decisions about which treatments are most cost-effective and to ensure that patients have access to the best possible care.
4. **Study the long-term costs of breast cancer care.** This could help to identify the factors that contribute to the high cost of breast cancer care and to develop strategies to reduce costs.
5. **Develop a decision-making tool to help patients and their families make informed decisions about breast cancer care.** This could help to ensure that patients receive the best possible care and that they are aware of the costs involved.
