This symmetry allows one to employ some two dimensional conformal field theory methods to understand the properties of the cosmological horizon. The entropy can be understood by using the Cardy formula, and the equation for scattering process in the near region has an agreement with the one obtained from a two point function in two dimensional conformal field theory. We also show that pair production can occur near the cosmological horizon in Kerr-Newman-Taub-NUT-de Sitter for near extremal conditions. \u2217haryanto.siahaan@unpar.ac.id",

            "text": "Astronomical observations suggest the expansion of our universe. In a relativistic theory of gravity, the expanding spacetime is described by the de Sitter solution [1, 2] that solves the Einstein equations of motions with a positive cosmological constant [3]. In the de Sitter spacetime, there exists the so-called cosmological horizon that behaves similar to black hole horizon in many ways. For example, one can compute the Hawking temperature associated to this horizon [4]. Consequently, there also exists a first law of thermodynamics relation for this horizon as proposed in [5, 6, 7]. Then it is understood that if a de Sitter spacetime contains black hole, then the spacetime is equipped with multiple horizons.\nThe Kerr/CFT correspondence is used to understand some aspects of black hole horizon [8, 9, 10]. The warped AdS structure in the near horizon geometry of an extremal black hole opens the possibility to use some two dimensional conformal field (CFT2) theory methods in understanding several aspects of black hole. For example, the Cardy formula for entropy in a CFT2 can recover the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the black hole. Another one is the scattering near horizon which can also be described by using a two point function calculation in a CFT2. The Kerr/CFT correspondence can also be extended to the non-extremal case where the conformal symmetry is hidden in the test scalar wave equation. Related to the Cardy formula in non-extremal setup, we assume that the corresponding central charge does not change as the geometry evolves from the extremal state. In literature, Kerr/CFT has been discussed for many cases of black holes that can exist in various theories of gravity [10, 11, 12, 13, 14].\nVarious similar properties between the black hole and cosmological horizons motivate us to establish the Kerr/CFT correspondence for the cosmological horizon. In literature, there exists a particular holography for de Sitter spacetime [15] that relates quantum gravity on D-dimensional de Sitter space to conformal field theory on a single (D-1)-sphere. However, in this work, we would like to employ the Kerr/CFT correspondence to the cosmological horizon in Kerr-Newman-TaubNUT-de Sitter spacetime that has several parameters, namely the rotation, electric charge, NUT parameter, and a positive cosmological constant. Here we also anticipate the newly proposed first law of thermodynamics for a NUT spacetime [16, 17] where it introduces some new conserved charges as thermodynamic parameters in the system. Following [7], we also consider the cosmological constant that can vary [18] which modify the first law of cosmological horizon mechanics.\nOn the other hand, the pair production can occur near the horizon of near extremal as a Schwinger effect [19, 20, 21, 22, 23] in analogy to such effect in strong electromagnetic field. It can be shown that the violation of the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound that associates to the massive scalar field near the horizon of the near extremal black hole leads to the conclusion that the pair production can exist. The resemblances between black hole and cosmological horizons suggest we investigate such an effect for the cosmological horizon in Kerr-Newman-Taub-NUT-de Sitter spacetime. To the best of our knowledge, such study has not appeared in literature.\nThe organization of this paper is as follows. In the next section we provide a short review on Kerr-Newman-Taub-NUT-de Sitter spacetime. The twofold hidden conformal symmetry is constructed in section 3. The microscopic entropy calculation is performed in section 4, whereas the supporting holographic scattering discussion is worked out in section 5. The study of pair production near the cosmological horizon is performed in section 6. Finally, a conclusion is given. In this paper we consider the natural units G = ~ = kB = c = 1."

(2.5)\nIt is known that multiple horizons with positive radii can exist in Kerr-Newman-Taub-NUT-de Sitter spacetime. The largest one is acknowledged as the cosmological horizon rc, the outer black\nhole horizon is rb, and the inner one is denoted by ri, where rc > rb > ri. The coincidence of cosmological and outer black hole horizons is known as the extremal state for cosmological horizon, whereas another coincidence rb = ri is understood as the extremal configuration for black holes in KNTNdS spacetime. Some illustrations of these extremal states are given in Figs. 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3. These plots confirm several extremalities that can exist in KNTNdS spacetime.\nThe area of cosmological horizon can be computed by using the standard formula\nAc =\n2\u03c0 \u222b\n\u03c6 =0\n\u03c0 \u222b\n\u03b8 =0\n\u221a g\u03b8\u03b8g\u03c6\u03c6d\u03b8d\u03c6 = 4\u03c0 ( r2c + a 2 + n2 ) , (2.6)\nwhereas the surface gravity associated to the cosmological horizon can be given by [16, 17]\n\u03bac = 2\u03c0\nAc\nd\u2206r dr\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223\nrc\n, (2.7)\nwhich gives\n\u03bac = (rc \u2212M) l2 \u2212 rc\n(\n2r2c + 6n 2 + a2\n)\n(r2c + a 2 + n2) l2\n.

The angular velocity and electric potential at the cosmological horizon can be written as\n\u2126c = a\nr2c + a 2 + n2\n, (2.9)\nand \u03a6c =\nqrc r2c + a 2 + n2 , (2.10)\nrespectively. The thermodynamics of Taub-NUT spacetime has become a lively discussion in recent years [16, 17, 24, 25, 26, 27]. One of the proposals is to associate an entropy for the Misner string in the Taub-NUT spacetime [25]. Another is to introduce some conserved charges, i.e. \u039e = Mn and N = n, so the resulting first law of horizon mechanics would read [16]\n\u03b4M = T\u03b4S +\u2126\u03b4J +\u03a6\u03b4Q+\u2126n\u03b4Jn +\u03a8\u03b4N +\u0398\u03b4\u039b . (2.11)\nThe last term in eq. (2.11) represents the change of total energy inside of the cosmological horizon due to the variation of cosmological constant. In section 4 where we compute the microscopic formula for the entropy, eq. (2.11) will be used to obtain the corresponding conjugate charge. Note that in the vanishing of \u03b4\u039b, \u03b4N , and \u03b4Jn, this first law of horizon mechanics simply reduces to the one which is related to the Kerr-Newman black hole [28]."

            "text": "The hidden conformal symmetry can be shown from the corresponding massless test scalar field in the near region of cosmological horizon. Here we consider the test charged massless scalar with an equation of motion\n(\u2207\u00b5 + iqA\u00b5) (\u2207\u00b5 + iqA\u00b5)\u03a8 = 0 . (3.1)\nNote that the KNTNdS spacetime possesses the stationary and axial Killing symmetry, which allow us to express the test scalar wave function to be separable in the following way,\n\u03a8 = e\u2212i\u03c9t+im\u03c6X (x)R (r) . (3.2)\nUsing this ansatz, the Klein-Gordon equation above can be written as\n1\nX (x)\nd\ndr\n(\n\u2206r dR (r)\ndr\n)\n+ 1\nR (r)\nd\ndx\n(\n\u2206x\u2206l dX (x)\ndx\n)\n+\n{\n(( r2 + a2 + n2 ) \u03c9 + qQr \u2212ma )2 \u2206r \u2212 ( ax2 + 2nx\u03c9 \u2212 am\u03c9 )2 \u2206l\u2206x\n}\n= 0 . (3.3)\nIt turns out that the last equation can be separated into two equations, namely the radial part\nd\ndr\n(\n\u2206r dR (r)\ndr\n)\n+\n(\n(( r2 + a2 + n2 ) \u03c9 + qQr \u2212ma )2\n\u2206r \u2212 \u03bb\n)\nR (r) = 0 , (3.4)\nand the angular one\nd\ndx\n(\n\u2206x\u2206l dX (x)\ndx\n) \u2212 ( \u2212 ( ax2 + 2nx\u03c9 \u2212 am\u03c9 )2\n\u2206l\u2206x \u2212 \u03bb\n)\nX (x) = 0 , (3.5)\nwith \u03bb as the separable constant. The hidden conformal symmetry is related to the radial equation (3.4) under some circumstances. However, before we proceed to show the hidden conformal symmetry, we need to consider an approximation to the \u2206r in the radial equation (3.4) so it can be quadratic in r. Such approximation has been repeatedly performed for the hidden conformal symmetry in the (anti)-de Sitter spacetime [13, 14, 29]. The approximation is basically a Taylor expansion for \u2206r near the cosmological horizon radius,\n\u2206r \u2243 \u2206r|rc + d\u2206r dr\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223\nrc\n(r \u2212 rc) + d2\u2206r dr2\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223\nrc\n(r \u2212 rc)2 2 , (3.6)\nthat can give us \u2206r \u2243 K (r \u2212 rc) (r \u2212 r\u2217c ) . (3.7)\nRelated to the KNTNdS spacetime (2.2), we have\nK = 1\u2212 l\u22122 ( a2 + 6n2 + 6r2c ) , (3.8)\nand\nr\u2217c = 2r3c + rc\n( l2 \u2212 a2 \u2212 6n2 ) \u2212 2Ml2 a2 + 6n2 + 6r2c \u2212 l2 . (3.9)\nNow let us impose the near horizon region for the test scalar, given by \u03c9r \u226a 1. We also consider that the test scalar is in the low frequency, \u03c9M \u226a 1, and its charge is extremely small, qQ \u226a 1. Subsequently, the low frequency can be related to the conditions \u03c9a \u226a 1, \u03c9Q \u226a 1, and \u03c9n \u226a 1.\nUnder such considerations, the radial equation (3.4) can be rewritten approximately as\nd\ndr\n(\n(r \u2212 rc) (r \u2212 r\u2217c ) dR\ndr\n)\n+ F1R\n(r \u2212 rc) +\nF2R\n(r \u2212 r\u2217c ) + F3R = 0 , (3.10)\nwith\nF1 =\n( \u03c9 ( r2c + a 2 + n2 ) + qQrc \u2212ma )2\nK2 (rc \u2212 r\u2217c ) , (3.11)\nF2 = \u2212 ( \u03c9 ( r\u22172c + a 2 + n2 ) + qQr\u2217c \u2212ma )2\nK2 (rc \u2212 r\u2217c ) , (3.12)\nand\nF3 = q2Q2 \u2212 \u03bb\nK . (3.13)\nFurthermore, to show the symmetry property of eq. (3.10), we consider the following conformal coordinates\n\u03c9+ =\n\u221a\nr \u2212 rc r \u2212 r\u2217c exp (2\u03c0TR\u03c6+ 2nRt) , (3.14)\n\u03c9+ =\n\u221a\nr \u2212 rc r \u2212 r\u2217c exp (2\u03c0TL\u03c6+ 2nLt) , (3.15)\n\u03c90 =\n\u221a\nrc \u2212 r\u2217c r \u2212 r\u2217c exp (\u03c0 (TR + TL)\u03c6+ (nR + nL) t) . (3.16)\nBy using these coordinates, and also the notations\n\u2202+ = \u2202\n\u2202\u03c9+ , \u2202\u2212 =\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03c9\u2212 , \u22020 =\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03c90 , (3.17)\none can define two copies of SL(2,R) generators that read\nH+ = i\u2202+ , (3.18)\nH0 = i\n(\n\u03c9+\u2202k,+ + 1\n2 \u03c90\u22020\n)\n, (3.19)\nH\u2212 = i ( ( \u03c9+ )2 \u2202+ + \u03c9 +\u03c90\u22020 \u2212 ( \u03c90 )2 \u2202\u2212 ) , (3.20)\nand H\u0304+ = i\u2202\u2212 , (3.21)\nH\u03040 = i\n(\n\u03c9\u2212\u2202\u2212 + 1\n2 \u03c90\u22020\n)\n, (3.22)\nH\u0304\u2212 = i ( ( \u03c9\u2212 )2 \u2202\u2212 + \u03c9 \u2212\u03c90\u22020 \u2212 ( \u03c90 )2 \u2202+ ) . (3.23)\nThe generators above satisfy the SL(2,R) algebra,\n[H0,H\u00b1] = \u2213iH\u00b1 , [H+,H\u2212] = 2iH0 , (3.24)\nand [\nH\u03040, H\u0304\u00b1 ] = \u2213iH\u0304\u00b1 , [ H\u0304+, H\u0304\u2212 ] = 2iH\u03040 . (3.25)\nMoreover, based on the generators above, one can also construct the SL(2,R) Casimir operators\nH2 = \u2212H20 + 1\n2 (H+H\u2212 +H\u2212H+) , (3.26)\nand\nH\u03042 = \u2212H\u030420 + 1\n2\n( H\u0304+H\u0304\u2212 + H\u0304\u2212H\u0304+ ) . (3.27)\nThese Casimir operators commute with all generators in the group. It turns out that despite the Casimir operators H2 and H\u0304 are constructed by a different set of operators, they take exactly the same form in terms of the conformal coordinates\nH2 = H\u03042 = 1 4 ( ( \u03c90 )2 \u220220 \u2212 \u03c90\u22020 ) + ( \u03c90 )2 \u2202+\u2202\u2212 (3.28)\nFurthermore, in terms of the coordinates (t, r, \u03c6), the Casimir operator (3.28) explicitly can be written as\nH2 = (r \u2212 rc) (r \u2212 r\u2217c ) \u22022\n\u2202r2 + (2r \u2212 r\u2217c \u2212 rc)\n\u2202\n\u2202r + (rc \u2212 r\u2217c ) r \u2212 r\u2217c\n(\nnL \u2212 nR 4\u03c0\u039e \u2202 \u2202\u03c6 \u2212 TL \u2212 TR 4\u039e \u2202 \u2202t\n)2\n\u2212 (rc \u2212 r \u2217 c )\nr \u2212 rc\n(\nnL + nR 4\u03c0\u039e \u2202 \u2202\u03c6 \u2212 TL + TR 4\u039e \u2202 \u2202t\n)2\n, (3.29)\nwhere \u039e = nLTR \u2212 nRTL. The hidden conformal symmetry is stated from the fact that the radial equation (3.10) is just the eigen equation for the Casimir operator H2 in eq. (3.29) with the separation constant \u03bb as the corresponding eigenvalue. In this fashion, it is said that the radial equation (3.10) exhibits the SL(2,R)L \u00d7 SL(2,R)R symmetry.\nIn the development, the discussion of hidden conformal symmetry for the black hole/CFT correspondence was found to exist in several pictures [28, 30]. The first one is known as the Jpicture which uses the neutral test scalar to probe the symmetry. This is actually the original proposal of hidden conformal symmetry in Kerr/CFT correspondence [31], where the property of low frequency neutral test scalar in the near region of Kerr black hole is explored. The second one is called Q-picture [32], where a U(1) internal space is introduced and the test scalar is considered to be in the state of zeroth quantum magnetic number. Subsequently, these J and Q pictures can be formulated into a single treatment known as the general picture [30] where the CFT duals are generated by the modular group SL(2,Z). In the following we show that the twofold or even the general pictures of hidden conformal symmetry that are applied for black hole horizon [28, 30] can also be found near the cosmological horizon.\nThe J picture is obtained by considering a neutral scalar test probe in the near horizon region. This consideration yields eq. (3.10) reduces to\nd\ndr\n(\n(r \u2212 rc) (r \u2212 r\u2217c ) dR\ndr\n)\n+ GJ1R\n(r \u2212 rc) +\nGJ2R\n(r \u2212 r\u2217c ) +GJ3R = 0 , (3.30)\nwhere\nGJ1 =\n( \u03c9 ( r\u22172c + a 2 + n2 ) \u2212ma )2\nK2 (rc \u2212 r\u2217c ) , (3.31)\nGJ2 = \u2212 ( \u03c9 ( r\u22172c + a 2 + n2 ) \u2212ma )2\nK2 (rc \u2212 r\u2217c ) , (3.32)\nand\nGJ3 = \u2212 \u03bb\nK . (3.33)\nTo have an agreement between the radial equation (3.30) with the general form (3.29), we need to set the corresponding parameters as\nnJR = 0 , n J L = \u2212\nK\n2 (rc + r\u2217c ) , (3.34)\nand\nT JR = K (rc \u2212 r\u2217c )\n4\u03c0a , T JL =\nK ( r2c + r \u2217 c 2 + 2a2 + 2n2 )\n4\u03c0a (rc + r\u2217c ) . (3.35)\nIn this way, we have constructed the J picture hidden conformal symmetry near the cosmological horizon of the KNTNdS spacetime.\nIf the J-picture corresponds to the neutral scalar test field, the Q-picture can be probed by using the scalar field at m = 0 state. However, the Q-picture hidden conformal symmetry requires the existence of a U(1) internal space \u03c7. The dependence of scalar wave \u03a8 with respect to this new coordinate is given by the eigen equation\n\u2202\u03c7\u03a8 = iq\u03a8 . (3.36)\nIndeed, it has an analogy with the equation for the angular coordinate \u03c6 where the scalar probe dependence is given by \u2202\u03c6\u03a8 = im\u03a8. For the m = 0 state, the radial equation (3.10) takes the form\nd\ndr\n(\n(r \u2212 rc) (r \u2212 r\u2217c ) dR\ndr\n) + GQ1 R\n(r \u2212 rc) +\nGQ2 R\n(r \u2212 r\u2217c ) +GQ3 R = 0 , (3.37)\nwhere\nGQ1 =\n( \u03c9 ( r2c + a 2 + n2 ) + qQrc )2\nK2 (rc \u2212 r\u2217c ) , (3.38)\nGQ2 = \u2212 ( \u03c9 ( r\u22172c + a 2 + n2 ) + qQr\u2217c )2\nK2 (rc \u2212 r\u2217c ) , (3.39)\nand\nGQ3 = q2Q2\nK2 . (3.40)\nIn order to have an agreement between (3.29) and (3.37), the corresponding parameters should be set as\nnQL = \u2212 K (rc + r\n\u2217 c )\n4 (rcr\u2217c \u2212 a2 \u2212 n2) , nQR = \u2212 K (rc \u2212 r\u2217c ) 4 (rcr\u2217c \u2212 a2 \u2212 n2) , (3.41)\nand\nTQL = \u2212 K ( r2c + r \u22172 c + 2a 2 + 2n2 )\n4\u03c0Q (rcr\u2217c \u2212 a2 \u2212 n2) , TQR = \u2212\nK ( r2c \u2212 r\u22172c )\n4\u03c0Q (rcr\u2217c \u2212 a2 \u2212 n2) . (3.42)\nHere we have shown that the Q-picture of hidden conformal symmetry for the cosmological horizon of KNTNdS spacetime does exist as well.\nNow let us discuss the general picture which combines both J and Q-pictures in a single formulation. The similarity between eqs. (3.30) and (3.37) are obvious. It then allows us to write an equation that utilizes the SL(2,Z) modular group which can reduce to both eqs. (3.30) and (3.37) for some special cases. The SL(2,Z) modular group itself acts on the torus with coordinates (\u03c6, \u03c7) that appear in eqs. (3.30) and (3.37). The corresponding SL(2,Z) transformation is given by\n(\n\u03c6\u2032 \u03c7\u2032\n)\n=\n(\n\u03b1 \u03b2 \u03b3 \u03b4\n)(\n\u03c6 \u03c7\n)\n. (3.43)\nIntuitively, related to the new coordinates \u03c6\u2032 and \u03c7\u2032, the corresponding eigenvalues of operators i\u2202\u03c6\u2032 and i\u2202\u03c7\u2032 are m \u2032 and q\u2032, respectively. Therefore, one can write the relation between the parameters (m, q) and (m\u2032, q\u2032) as m = \u03b1m\u2032 + \u03b3q\u2032 , q = \u03b2m\u2032 + \u03b4q\u2032 . (3.44)\nIn terms of (m\u2032, q\u2032) parameters, the radial equation (3.10) can be rewritten as\nd\ndr\n(\n(r \u2212 rc) (r \u2212 r\u2217c ) dR\ndr\n)\n+ GG1 R\n(r \u2212 rc) +\nGG2 R\n(r \u2212 r\u2217c ) +GG3 R = 0 , (3.45)\nwhere\nGG1 =\n( \u03c9 ( r2c + a 2 + n2 ) \u2212 (a\u03b1\u2212Q\u03b2rc)m\u2032 \u2212 (a\u03b3 \u2212Q\u03b4rc) q\u2032 )2\nK2 (rc \u2212 r\u2217c ) , (3.46)\nGG2 = \u2212 ( \u03c9 ( r\u22172c + a 2 + n2 ) \u2212 (a\u03b1\u2212Q\u03b2r\u2217c )m\u2032 \u2212 (a\u03b3 \u2212Q\u03b4r\u2217c ) q\u2032 )2\nK2 (rc \u2212 r\u2217c ) , (3.47)\nand\nGG3 = (\u03b2m\u2032 + \u03b4q\u2032)2Q2 \u2212 \u03bb\nK . (3.48)\nIn this general picture, the J \u2032-picture can be obtained by setting q\u2032 = 0, and the Q\u2032-picture is achieved at m\u2032 = 0. Note that these two J \u2032 and Q\u2032 pictures are equal to each other. In Q\u2032-picture, the hidden conformal symmetry exists if we set the corresponding parameters in eq. (3.29) to be\nnGL = \u2212 K (2a\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b4Q (rc + r\u2217c ))\n4 (a\u03b3 (rc + r\u2217c ) + \u03b4Q (a 2 + n2 \u2212 rcr\u2217c ))\n, (3.49)\nnGR = K\u03b4Q (rc \u2212 r\u2217c )\n4 (a\u03b3 (rc + r\u2217c ) + \u03b4Q (a 2 + n2 \u2212 rcr\u2217c ))\n, (3.50)\nTGL = K ( r2c + (r \u2217 c ) 2 + 2a2 + 2n2 )\n4\u03c0 (a\u03b3 (rc + r\u2217c ) + \u03b4Q (a 2 + n2 \u2212 rcr\u2217c ))\n, (3.51)\nand\nTGR = K ( r2c \u2212 (r\u2217c )2 )\n4\u03c0 (a\u03b3 (rc + r\u2217c ) + \u03b4Q (a 2 + n2 \u2212 rcr\u2217c ))\n.

            "text": "In the previous section, we have established the hidden conformal symmetries that associate to the cosmological horizon in KNTNdS spacetime. These symmetries open the possibility to apply some CFT2 methods to understand several aspects related to the cosmological horizon. In this section, we show that the cosmological horizon entropy has a dual description from a CFT2 point of view by using the Cardy formula. The same argument has been used to construct Kerr/CFT holography to recover the entropy of black holes [8, 10]. The dual calculations for cosmological horizon entropy are performed separately in J and Q-pictures where each of them requires a particular approach to obtain the corresponding near horizon geometry.\nLet us first consider the J-picture. The appropriate near horizon coordinate transformation in the near extremal state is\nr = rc + r\n\u2217 c\n2 + \u03b5r0r\u0303 , rc \u2212 r\u2217c = \u00b5\u03b5r0 , t = t\u0303 r0 \u03b5 , \u03c6 = \u03c6\u0303 +\u2126H t\u0303 r0 \u03b5 .

(4.7)\nA general formula to compute the central charge associated to the near horizon of a near extremal geometry in the family of Einstein-Maxwell theory has been computed in [9], and the obtained formula can apply to the near horizon geometry that appears in eq. (4.2). The central charges are [9]\ncJL = c J R = 3k\u0303 J\n1 \u222b\n\u22121\ndx \u221a \u0393 (x) \u03b3 (x )\u03b1 (x ) , (4.8)\nfor the cosmological horizon in KNTNdS spacetime we have\ncJL = c J R =\n6a(rc + r \u2217 c )\nK . (4.9)\nUsing the central charge (4.9), the Cardy formula\nSJCardy = \u03c02\n3\n(\ncJLT J L + c J RT J R\n)\n(4.10)\ngives us the entropy of cosmological horizon in KNTNdS spacetime, namely\nSJCardy = \u03c0 ( r2c + a 2 + n2 ) . (4.11)\nIn the next section, we will provide the holographic calculation for absorption cross section by using a two point function of the operator that is dual to the scalar field. For that calculation, one needs to identify the conjugate charges \u03b4EJL and \u03b4E J R that satisfy\n\u03b4SJCardy = \u03b4EJL T JL + \u03b4EJR T JR . (4.12)\nThe conjugate charges can be obtained by using the first law of thermodynamics for the cosmological horizon (2.11) and the corresponding equation is\n\u03b4S = \u03b4M \u2212 \u2126\u03b4J \u2212\u03a6\u03b4Q\u2212\u03a8dN \u2212 \u2126n\u03b4Jn \u2212\u0398 \u03b4\u039b\nT = \u03b4EJL T JL + \u03b4EJR T JR . (4.13)\nRecall that for the Kerr-Newman black hole, the related first law of thermodynamics can be written as\n\u03b4M = T\u03b4S +\u2126\u03b4J +\u03a6\u03b4Q . (4.14)\nTo obtain the conjugate charges in Kerr/CFT correspondence for the Kerr-Newman black hole, the variations of black hole parameters in eq. (4.14) are related to some of the scalar probe parameters. The change in angular momentum is related to the magnetic quantum number m, whereas the change in electric charge is connected with the probe\u2019s electric charge.\nHowever, the first law of thermodynamics (4.13) contains several terms that do not have a direct counterpart with the scalar probe\u2019s properties. Therefore, here we propose some generalizations for the variations related to the rotational and electromagnetic works, i.e.\n\u2126\u2032\u03b4J \u2032 = \u2126\u03b4J +\u2126n\u03b4Jn +\u0398\u03b4\u039b . (4.15)\nand \u03a6\u2032\u03b4Q\u2032 = \u03a6 \u03b4Q+\u03a8\u03b4N , (4.16)\nrespectively. In such generalizations, we can have \u03b4M = \u03c9 and \u03b4J \u2032 = m. In J picture, we can have\n\u03b4EJL = \u03c9 J L and \u03b4E J R = \u03c9 J R , (4.17)\nwhere\n\u03c9JL = r2c + (r \u2217 c ) 2 + 2a2 + 2n2\n2a \u03c9 , \u03c9JR =\nr2c + (r \u2217 c ) 2 + 2a2 + 2n2\n2a \u03c9 \u2212m, (4.18)\nqJL = q J R = 0 , and \u00b5 J L = \u00b5 J R = 0 . (4.19)\nNow let us turn to microscopic entropy calculation associated with the Q-picture hidden conformal symmetry. As it has been mentioned previously, we need to add a U(1) internal extra dimension\nin the theory denoted by the coordinate \u03c7. The corresponding five dimensional spacetime metric then can be read as\nds2 = ds24 + ( d\u03c7 + A\u0303 )2 , (4.20)\nwhere ds24 is the near horizon metric of near extremal horizon (4.2) and A\u0303 is the associated gauge field. Now let us consider the fluctuation of five dimensional metric with a set of coordinate {t\u0303, \u03c6\u0303, \u03b8, r\u0303, \u03c7} in the following way,\nh\u00b5\u03bd \u223c\n\n    \nO ( r\u03032 )\nO (r\u0303) O (1/r\u0303) O ( 1/r\u03032 ) O (1) O (1/r\u0303) O (1) O (1/r\u0303) O (1)\nO (1/r\u0303) O ( 1/r\u03032 ) O (1/r\u0303) O ( 1/r\u03033 )\nO (1/r\u0303) O (1)\n\n     . (4.21)\nThe most general diffeomorphism that preserves the boundary condition in (4.21) is\n\u03b6(\u03c7 ) = \u03b5 (\u03c7 ) \u2202 \u2202\u03c7 \u2212 r\u0303 d\u03b5 (\u03c7 ) d\u03c7 \u2202 \u2202r\u0303 , (4.22)\nwhere \u03b5 (\u03c7 ) = exp (\u2212iq\u03c7). To compute the central charge, we can generalize the treatment developed in [9] and we can get\ncQL = c Q R = 3k\u0303 Q\n1 \u222b\n\u22121\ndx \u221a \u0393 (x ) \u03b3 (x )\u03b1 (x ) = 6Q ( rcr \u2217 c \u2212 a2 \u2212 n2 )\nK . (4.23)\nNote that the negative value of this central charge leads to the non-unitary CFT2. Therefore, to guarantee the unitary, we have to impose rcr \u2217 c > a\n2 + n2 and the positive values consideration of Q and K. However, sometime the non-unitary dual CFT2 is unavoidable in several systems. For example, in the case of a strong magnetic field for the magnetized Kerr/CFT holography [33]. This central charge then can be used to compute the microscopic entropy by using Cardy formula\nS = \u03c02\n3\n(\ncQLT Q L + c Q RT Q R\n)\n, (4.24)\nwhich recovers the entropy of the cosmological horizon in KNTNdS spacetime in eq. (4.11). Similar to the J-picture, the conjugate charges in Q-picture can be extracted from the first law of thermodynamics, i.e.\n\u03b4S = \u03b4M \u2212\u2126\u2032\u03b4J \u2032 \u2212 \u03a6\u2032\u03b4Q\u2032\nT =\n\u03b4EQL\nTQL +\n\u03b4EQR\nTQR , (4.25)\nwhere \u2126\u2032\u03b4J \u2032 is given in (4.15) and \u03a6\u2032\u03b4Q\u2032 is given in (4.16). However, since in the Q picture we consider the case of m = 0 only, the term \u2126\u2032\u03b4J \u2032 can be neglected. The last equation can be solved by setting\n\u03b4EQL = \u03c9 Q L \u2212 q Q L\u00b5 Q L , \u03b4E Q R = \u03c9 Q R \u2212 q Q R\u00b5 Q R , (4.26)\nwhere\n\u03c9QL = \u03c9 Q R =\nn (rc + r \u2217 c ) ( r2c + (r \u2217 c ) 2 + 2a2 + 2n2 )\n2Q (rcr\u2217c \u2212 a2 \u2212 n2) \u03c9 , (4.27)\nqQL = q Q R = \u03b4Qc = q , (4.28)\nand\n\u00b5QL = n ( r2c + (r \u2217 c ) 2 + 2a2 + 2n2 )\n2 (rcr\u2217c \u2212 a2 \u2212 n2) , \u00b5QR =\nn (rc + r \u2217 c )\n2\n2 (rcr\u2217c \u2212 a2 \u2212 n2) . (4.29)\nBefore proceeding to the next section, let us here give some remarks on the results above. As we have mentioned in the introduction that a holography for de Sitter geometry has been reported in [15] where the author established a connection between the gravity theory in D-dimensional de Sitter space with a conformal field theory living in (D-1)-sphere. Particularly, for the three dimensional de Sitter (dS3) background, the corresponding dual theory is a two dimensional conformal field theory which is exactly similar to the case presented in this paper. Moreover, the technique to compute the central charge that associates to the asymptotics symmetries of dS3 is the analogous calculation by Brown and Henneaux in [34]. In fact, the method by Brown and Henneaux for the central charge is also the method adopted in Kerr/CFT correspondence [8]. As we have mentioned previously, the work presented in this paper is an application of Kerr/CFT correspondence to the cosmological horizon of KNTNdS spacetime. Therefore, one can say that basically the work in this paper and the dS/CFT correspondence reported in [15] depart from the same basis. Note that the author of [15] is also one of the authors of [8] and [31] that establish the Kerr/CFT correspondence.\nHowever, the constructions of dS/CFT holography in [15] and the one presented here are distinguished in several aspects. First, the dual CFT theory proposed in [15] is (D-1)-dimensional, for D as the dimension of gravitational theory in dS3. Typically in the Kerr/CFT holography, the dual CFT theory is two dimensional regardless of the dimension of bulk spacetime under consideration [15, 10]. Second, the asymptotic geometry considered in [15] is still de Sitter, whereas in this paper the corresponding near-horizon of (near)-extremal geometry as appeared in eq. (4.2) is warped anti-de Sitter. Consequently, these distinguished asymptotic geometries require different types of boundary conditions to be used in the diffeomorphism generators that lead to distinctive central charges. Third, the central charge obtained in this work fails to reduce smoothly to the non-rotating or neutral cases. It can be observed that in general the central charges (4.9) and (4.23) vanish in the case of a = 0 and Q = 0, respectively. This limitation is well known for the Kerr/CFT correspondence as it works for the rotating and/or charged case only, i.e. the black hole/CFT correspondence for Schwarzschild black hole in the style of [8] is not well established. On the other hand, the holography for de Sitter spacetime established in [15] can be extended to the case that incorporates black holes [35].\n5 CFT2 correlators and superradiant scattering\nNormally, in the Kerr/CFT correspondence discussions for black holes, another evidence in supporting the holography is the dual calculation for scalar absorption near the horizon. Similar to that, here we also provide such calculations in the near cosmological horizon, and show that the dictionary of Kerr/CFT correspondence still applies. To start, let us consider the frequency near superradiant bound for the scalar field\n\u03c9 \u2212m\u2126\u2212 q\u03a6 = \u03c9\u0304 \u03b5 r0 . (5.1)\nThe scattering analysis can be done in J or Q picture, and consequently it should be feasible in the general picture as well. Here let us consider the J-picture only, where the corresponding radial equation is eq. (3.30). The solution to this equation reads\nR (\u03b6) = \u03b6\u03b1 (1\u2212 \u03b6)\u03b2 F (a, b, c; \u03b6) , (5.2)\nwhere \u03b6 = (r \u2212 rc) (r \u2212 r\u2217c )\u22121, i\u03b1 = \u221a\nGJ1 , (5.3)\n2\u03b2 = 1\u2212 \u221a\n1\u2212 4GJ3 , (5.4) and\na\u2217 = \u03b1+ \u03b2 + i \u221a \u2212GJ2 , b\u2217 = \u03b1+ \u03b2 \u2212 i \u221a \u2212GJ2 , c\u2217 = 1 + 2\u03b1 . (5.5)\nMoreover, the radial solution (5.2) in the near horizon of near extremal setup can be read as\nR ( \u03b6\u0304 ) = \u03b6\u0304 \u03b1\u0304 ( 1\u2212 \u03b6\u0304 )\u03b2\u0304 F ( a\u0304\u2217, b\u0304\u2217, c\u0304\u2217; \u03b6\u0304 ) , (5.6)\nwhere\n\u03b6\u0304 = (r\u0303 \u2212 \u00b5/2) (r\u0303 + \u00b5/2) , (5.7)\nand the incorporating parameters are\ni\u03b1\u0304 = \u221a\nG\u0304J1 , (5.8)\n2\u03b2\u0304 = 1\u2212 \u221a\n1\u2212 4G\u0304J3 , (5.9)\na\u0304\u2217 = \u03b1\u0304+ \u03b2\u0304 + i \u221a \u2212G\u0304J2 , b\u0304\u2217 = \u03b1\u0304+ \u03b2\u0304 \u2212 i \u221a\n\u2212G\u0304J2 , c\u0304\u2217 = 1 + 2\u03b1\u0304 , (5.10) and\nG\u0304J1 = (\u03c9\u0304)2\n\u03bb\u03042 , G\u0304J2 = \u2212\n(\n\u03c9\u0304 \u03bb\u0304 \u2212 2rcm\u2126c K\n)2\n, G\u0304J3 = \u2212 \u03bb\u0304\nK . (5.11)\nNow let us consider the asymptotics of radial solution (5.6) above. If one takes \u03b6\u0304 \u226b \u00b5, which corresponds to a large r\u0303, the radial solution above reduces to\nR(\u03b6\u0304) \u223c C+\u03b6\u0304h\u22121 + C\u2212\u03b6\u0304\u2212h . (5.12)\nIn such asymptotics, one can get the corresponding retarded Green function in the form\nGR \u223c C\u2212 C+ . (5.13)\nExplicitly in our near horizon of near extremal setup, the reading of this retarded Green function is\nGR \u223c \u0393 (1\u2212 2h) \u0393 (2h\u2212 1)\n\u0393 ( h\u2212 i ( G\u0304J1 \u2212 G\u0304J2 )) \u0393 ( h\u2212 i ( G\u0304J1 + G\u0304 J 2 ))\n\u0393 ( 1\u2212 h\u2212 i ( G\u0304J1 \u2212 G\u0304J2 )) \u0393 ( 1\u2212 h\u2212 i ( G\u0304J1 + G\u0304 J 2\n)) . (5.14)\nInterestingly, the Green function above has an agreement with a two point function of the scalar operator in a CFT2. For a scalar operator O\u0302 that is dual to the scalar test probe, the two point function can be written as\nG ( \u03c4+, \u03c4\u2212 ) = \u2329 O\u0302\u2020 ( \u03c4+, \u03c4\u2212 ) , O\u0302 (0, 0) \u232a , (5.15)\nwhere the left and right moving coordinates in a two dimensional worldsheet are given by \u03c4+ and \u03c4\u2212, respectively. The two point function (5.15) is dictated by the conformal invariance and can be read as [32, 29]\nG ( \u03c4+, \u03c4\u2212 ) \u223c (\u22121)hL+hR (\n\u03c0T JL sinh (\n\u03c0T JL \u03c4 + )\n)2hL (\n\u03c0T JR sinh (\n\u03c0T JR\u03c4 \u2212 )\n)2hR\nei(q J L \u00b5J L \u03c4++qJ R \u00b5J R \u03c4\u2212) , (5.16)\nwith (hL, hR) are the conformal dimensions, and hL = hR = h. It is understood that ( qJL, q J R )\nare the charges, (\nT JL , T J R\n) are the temperatures, and ( \u00b5JL, \u00b5 J R ) are the chemical potentials that associate\nto the operator O\u0302. In the equation above, we have incorporated the parameters in J-picture. The Euclidean correlator can be evaluated along the positive imaginary {\n\u03c9JL, \u03c9 J R\n}\naxis, i.e.\nGE ( \u03c9JL,E, \u03c9 J L,E ) = GR ( i\u03c9JL,E , i\u03c9 J L,E ) , (5.17)\nfor a positive {\n\u03c9JL,E, \u03c9 J L,E\n}\n. In the theory with a finite temperature, \u03c9JL,E and \u03c9 J L,E are discrete\nand take the values of Matsubara frequencies,\n\u03c9JL,E 2\u03c0T JL = mL and \u03c9R,E 2\u03c0T JR = mR , (5.18)\nwhere mL and mR are integers. Performing a Wick rotation to the 2D worldsheet coordinate, i.e.\n\u03c4+ \u2192 i\u03c4L and \u03c4\u2212 \u2192 i\u03c4R , (5.19)\nwhere the Euclidean time \u03c4L and \u03c4R have the periodicity 2\u03c0/T J L and 2\u03c0/T J R , respectively. Accordingly, the Euclidean correlator obtained from the two point function (5.15) can be written as\nGE ( \u03c9JL,E, \u03c9 J R,E ) \u223c T JL 2hL\u22121 T JR 2hR\u22121 exp\n[\ni\n(\n\u03c9\u0303JL,E 2T JL + \u03c9\u0303R,E 2T JR\n)]\n\u0393\n(\nhL + \u03c9\u0303JL,E\n2\u03c0T JL\n)\n\u0393\n(\nhL \u2212 \u03c9\u0303JL,E\n2\u03c0T JL\n)\n\u00d7 \u0393 ( hR + \u03c9\u0303R,E\n2\u03c0T JR\n)\n\u0393\n(\nhR \u2212 \u03c9\u0303R,E\n2\u03c0T JR\n)\n, (5.20)\nwhere \u03c9\u0303JL,E = \u03c9 J L,E \u2212 iqJL\u00b5JL and \u03c9\u0303JR,E = \u03c9JR,E \u2212 iqJR\u00b5JR . (5.21)\nThe agreement between (5.20) and (5.14) establishes the correspondence between a two dimensional conformal field theory and cosmological horizon in terms of scalar absorption calculation. It can be viewed as another supporting evidence for the Kerr/CFT correspondence of the cosmological horizon."

            "heading": "6 Pair production",
            "text": "It has been shown that there exists a strong correlation between the existence of non-extremal Kerr/CFT correspondence and the pair production known as Schwinger effect near the horizon at near extremal state [19, 20]. In the previous sections, we have shown that the Kerr/CFT holography dictionary can also be applied to the cosmological horizon. It motivates us to investigate the possibility for Schwinger effect to take place near the KNTNdS cosmological horizon. However, the required near horizon transformation is slightly different compared to the one in eq. (4.1) when we compute the central charge. The appropriate one to show the Schwinger effect is\nr \u2192 r\u03030 + \u03b5r\u0302 , dt \u2192 ( r\u030320 + a 2 + n2 )\n\u22060\u03b5 dt\u0302 , d\u03c6 \u2192 d\u03c6\u0302+ \u2126\u0302\n(\nr\u030320 + a 2 + n2\n)\n\u22060\u03b5 dt\u0302 . (6.1)\nNote that we use the \u201chat\u201d notation for the near horizon coordinate to distinguish it with the \u201ctilde\u201d one in (4.2). In addition to the coordinate changes above, the mass is also shifted as\nM \u2192 M0 + \u22060B\n2\n2r\u03030 \u03b52 . (6.2)\nApplying the transformations above to the spacetime metric (2.2) and the vector solution (2.5) followed by taking \u03b5 \u2192 0 yields\nds2 = \u2212 \u03c1 2 0\n\u22060\n( r\u03022 \u2212B2 ) dt\u03022 + \u03c120\n\u22060 (r\u03022 \u2212B2) dr\u03022 + \u03c120 \u2206l\u2206x dx2 + Z2\u2206l\u2206x \u03c120\n(\nd\u03c6\u0302+ 2ar\u03030r\u0302\nZ\u22060 dt\u0302\n)\n(6.3)\nwhere Z = r\u030320 + a 2 + n2,\n\u22060 = 1\u2212 a2 + 6\n( r\u030320 + n 2 )\nl2 , (6.4)\n\u03c120 = r\u0303 2 0 + (n+ ax) 2 , (6.5)\nand the corresponding gauge field is\nA\u00b5dx \u00b5 = \u2212\nQ ( r\u030320 \u2212 (n+ ax)2 ) r\u0302\n\u03c120\u22060 dt\u0302\u2212 Qr\u03030Z a\u03c120 d\u03c6\u0302 . (6.6)\nInterestingly, the result for near horizon geometry (6.3) looks similar to the near horizon metric (4.2) that gives the central charge (4.9). However, a closer look will show that these near horizon metrics are actually different from one another. It is understandable since the associated coordinate transformations to produce these near horizon metrics are slightly different. The coordinate transformation (4.1) incorporates the variables r\u2217c andK, which are basically the outcome of approaching \u2206r in KNTNdS metric (2.2) to be quadratic in r. Recall that such quadratic property is required to reveal the hidden conformal symmetry of the scalar probe. Accordingly, the associated central charge for the near horizon geometry (4.2) is the one needed to produce the Cardy entropy (4.11) after employing the left and right movers temperatures in the related hidden conformal symmetry generators. On the other hand, the near horizon geometry (6.3) and the corresponding coordinate transformation (6.1) do not incorporate r\u2217c and K, as we consider the KNTNdS line element without any approximation for the \u2206r function. However, suppose one compute the central charge that\ncorrespond to the asymptotic symmetry of near horizon geometry (6.3), the resulting entropy after using Cardy formula and the suitable temperatures obtained in section 3 will not match the expected entropy for KNTNdS cosmological horizon. Nevertheless, for the case without cosmological constant, the near horizon of extremal black holes obtained by using the coordinate transformation (6.1) can give the appropriate central charge to reproduce the related Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. For example, using the general central charge formula (4.8) for the near horizon of extremal KerrNewman black hole in [36] gives the correct central charge c = 12Ma for the microscopic entropy calculation in J-picture [28]. Note that ref. [36] discusses Schwinger effect near the Kerr-Newman black hole.\nNow let us consider the Klein-Gordon equation for a charged massive test scalar in the near horizon of near extremal geometry constructed above. The general form reads\n(\u2207\u00b5 + iqA\u00b5) (\u2207\u00b5 + iqA\u00b5)\u03a8 = \u00b52\u03a8 , (6.7) where \u00b5 is mass for the scalar field. To proceed, we employ the similar ansatz as the one we use to show the hidden conformal symmetry in section 3. In the appropriate coordinate, it reads\n\u03a6\u0302 = exp ( \u2212i\u03c9\u0302t\u0302+ im\u0302\u03c6\u0302 ) X (x) R\u0302 (r\u0302) . (6.8)\nSubsequently, the resulting equations are\n\u22060\u2202r\u0302\n{\n( r\u03022 \u2212B2 ) \u2202r\u0302R\u0302 (r\u0302) } +\n{\n(Z\u22060\u03c9\u0302 \u2212 qQZr\u0302 + 2r\u03030am\u0302r\u0302)2 Z2\u22060 (r\u03022 \u2212B2) \u2212 \u00b52Z \u2212 \u03bbl } R = 0 , (6.9)\nand\n\u2202x {\u2206l\u2206xX (x)} \u2212 { ( qQr\u03030Z \u2212 a\u03c120m\u0302 )2\na2\u2206xZ2\u2206l \u2212 \u00b52 (a\u2206x \u2212 2nx)\u2212 \u03bbl\n}\nX (x) = 0 . (6.10)\nAccordingly, the effective mass in the radial equation (6.9) can be written as [19, 20, 21]\nm2eff = m 2 \u2212 (2r\u03030am\u0302\u2212 qQZ)\n2\nZ3\u22060 + \u03bbl Z . (6.11)\nThe corresponding Breitenlohner-Freedman bound that associates to the stability condition in the near horizon of AdS space, i.e. m2eff \u2265 14L \u22122 AdS , can be expressed as\nm2eff \u2265 \u2212 \u22060 4Z . (6.12)\nThe violation of Breitenlohner-Freedman bound as stated in (6.12) leads to the Schwinger effect near the cosmological horizon in KNTNdS spacetime. Similar to the pair production from black hole horizon in the near extremal state, such an effect can take place as well near the cosmological horizon. Indeed, the horizon must be in the near extremal condition, so it has a warped AdS structure that is needed in the prescription to show the Schwinger effect [19, 20].\nWe do not present here the thermal interpretation for the Schwinger effect above. But it can be done straightforwardly by following the prescription given in [19, 21]. Illustrations for the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound violation are given in fig. 6.1 where the corresponding r\u03030 values are evaluated in fig. 6.2. Note that we require r\u03030 to be real so the corresponding plots in fig. 6.1 are well defined. The plots in fig. 6.1 confirms the pair production can exist, and we can observe how NUT parameter affects the magnitude of \u03a5 = m2eff + \u22060 4Z < 0, where we can infer that the presence of NUT parameter yields the stronger violation of Breitenlohner-Freedman bound."

The method to construct the symmetry is straightforward by using the prescription that is normally employed for the black hole horizon. The obtained hidden conformal symmetry allows one to consider the Kerr/CFT holography for the cosmological horizon, such as in reproducing the entropy and the absorption cross section. The compatibility of Kerr/CFT holography for the cosmological horizon is expected due to the similarities between black hole and cosmological horizons, for example the associated entropy and Hawking radiation.\nInterestingly, the AdS2 \u00d7 S2 or warped AdS3 structure of the near horizon of a near extremal black hole can be used in showing the Schwinger effect near the black hole horizon. In fact, these structures of the horizon play an important role in computing the central charge in the Cardy formula. After showing compatibility of the Kerr/CFT holography for the cosmological horizon in KNTNdS spacetime, we show that the Schwinger effect can also occur near this horizon. Obviously such an effect can take place as well near the cosmological horizon of some special cases in the family of KNTNdS spacetime. That includes the Reissner-Nordstrom -NUT-de Sitter and the Kerr-NUT-de Sitter spacetime, including the vanishing NUT parameter consideration.\nFor the future works, we can investigate the hidden conformal symmetry and pair production near the cosmological horizon of dilatonic de Sitter [37]. Such study for the de Sitter geometry in low energy heterotic string theory [38] can be attractive as well, considering the Kerr/CFT can be applied to this case [11]. Studying the pair production near the Kaluza-Klein black hole can also be interesting, due to its resemblances to the Kerr-Newman case."
