    "abstractText": "Wound-healing delay is one of the major problems of type 2 diabetes, representing also a clinical emergency in non-healing chronic wounds. Natural antioxidants show interesting woundhealing properties, including those extracted from waste derived from olive oil production. Olive mill wastewater is one of the main by-products of the olive oil-making process, and it is rich in high-value secondary metabolites, mainly hydroxytyrosol. We proposed an eco-friendly extraction method, employing both ultrasound-assisted and Soxhlet techniques and ethanol as a solvent, to recover valuable molecules from Roggianella cv (Olea europea L.) olive mill wastewater, which was further entrapped in a pectin polymer via an enzymatic reaction using porcine pancreatic lipase. Pectin, in combination with other substances, promoted and accelerated wound healing and demonstrated good potential to produce a biomedical conjugate for wound treatment. The antioxidant activity of the extracts and conjugate were evaluated against lipophilic (IC50 equal to 0.152 mg mL\u22121) and hydrophilic (IC50 equal to 0.0371 mg mL\u22121) radical species as well as the in vitro cytotoxicity via NRU, h-CLAT, and a wound-healing scratch assay and assessment. The pectin conjugate did not exert hemolytic effects on the peripheral blood, demonstrating interesting wound-healing properties due to its ability to stimulate cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner.",

The healing process involves overlapping steps: inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling, leading finally to wound closure (acute wounds). On the contrary, chronic wounds are defined as non-healing wounds due to the impossibility of restoring the skin barrier, which is caused by an excessive neutrophil infiltration generating a permanent high-inflammatory tissue; at the same time, matrix metalloproteinases are found to be abundant as well, leading to long-time healing. These\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 15075. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms242015075 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 15075 2 of 22\nchronic wounds still represent a clinical emergency [2]. The current treatment methodologies are wound dressing, vacuum-assisted closure procedures, photo biomodulation, hyperbaric oxygen, immune-modulatory biomaterials, the application of bacteriophages, angiogenesis promotion, and antioxidative and antibacterial nanomaterials [3]. However, all these protocols are expensive, limited in their efficacy, and time consuming. For this reason, the discovery of new therapeutic alternatives seems to be necessary. Natural products, especially antioxidants [4,5] and their derivatives [6\u20139], can offer similar, if not better, biological activity than many synthetic drugs that are used in healing chronic wounds, thanks to their ability to reduce the inflammation in the wound region as well as the bacterial proliferation. Furthermore, considering the oxidative stress that is stated in chronic wounds, an antioxidant agent could be helpful during the wound-healing evolution. In this context, food production wastes could be also a valuable source of secondary metabolites supporting the wound-healing process [10]. Considering that drug carriers are mostly used in wound-healing applications [11,12], in this experimental work, olive mill wastewater (OMW) was proposed as a source of active molecules that are opportunely linked to a biopolymer. With about 3 million tons produced last year and a global market valued at USD 12,989,630,000, olive oil is a pillar of Mediterranean countries, mostly Spain, Italy, and Greece [13]. Nevertheless, during production, olive oil generates huge amounts of different wastes (i.e., pruning residues, stones, olive mill wastewaters, and pomace). Among them, OMW and olive pomace represent about 35\u201345% of the processed drupes, representing a severe environmental burden in terms of both quantities (30 million m3 per year and 2 million tons per year, respectively) and polluting capacity (pH, chemical and biological oxygen demand, etc.) [14]. The polyphenols that are present in OMW have been already investigated for the treatment of skin disorders. Recently, the lipophenol hydroxytyrosil oleate (HtyOle) was recovered from olive pomace and OMW, to be evaluated for their antioxidant capacity in human keratinocytes. The formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA), as well as the activity of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), were reduced by HtyOle [15]. In OMW, the main compounds are derived from hydroxylation using benzoic acid (C6\u2013C1) or cinnamic acid (C6\u2013C3) (phenylpropanoid family). Hydroxytyrosol (HT) and tyrosol are frequently found in OMW together with caffeic and ferulic acids and more complex phenolic compounds, such as verbascoside, oleuropein, and isomers/derivatives. Furthermore, among the phenolic compounds detected in dried mill wastewater by liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS), the most abundant were apigenin (9.55 mg/kg dry weight), p-coumaric acid (5.01 mg/kg dry weight), diosmetin (3.58 mg/kg dry weight), hydroxytyrosil oleate (564 mg/kg dry weight), luteolin (62.38 mg/kg dry weight), luteolin-7-O-glucoside (88.55 mg/kg dry weight), luteolin-4-Oglucoside (11.48 mg/kg dry weight), and rutin (48.52 mg/kg dry weight) [16]. The catechol function confers strong antioxidant activity to these compounds, which is exerted either by chelating metals that participate in the generation of free radicals or by direct neutralization of the free radicals by transformation into a stable quinone final product [17]. In this research, a lyophilized OWM has been successfully extracted using Soxhlet or ultrasound-assisted methodologies by employing solvents at different polarity (ethanol, acetone, dichloromethane, n-hexane, and hydroalcoholic mixture). Colorimetric tests, performed to evaluate the antioxidant potential of the extracts, allowed to individuate that the ethanolic one is the extract richest in phenolic compounds. Additionally, spectroscopic methodologies (HPLC/MS/MS, and NMR) revealed the presence of several interesting metabolites sharing the 3,4-dihydroxyphenilethyl moiety, which is typical of the HY. Several types of scientific evidence highly recommended HY as a bioactive compound to be used as a pharmaceutical product for wound care applications as HY showed useful proangiogenic, antioxidative, antiaging, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial effects [17,18]. For all these reasons, we aim to develop a functional pectin biopolymer as a new tool for wound-healing applications. The OH in the active compounds of ethanolic extract can be transesterified\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 15075 3 of 22\nwith the COOCH3 moieties of the pectin by using porcine pancreatic lipase (PPL) as a green and recyclable catalyst. The functional pectin biopolymer was characterized using the ESI MS/MS and NMR. To reveal the better wound healing properties endowed by the functional polymer, in vitro assays were carried out also to demonstrate the absence of hemolysis activity."

            "text": "OMW is an aqueous suspension rich in organic and inorganic compounds, such as tannins, pectins as well as phenolic molecules ranging from 0.5 to 24 g/OMW and representing about 98% (w/w) of the phenols that are usually found in the drupe [19]. The vegetal by-product was freeze-dried producing a powder that is easy to handle (ELAVF). ELAVF displayed remarkable biological properties related to a high concentration of available phenolic groups (TPC) (75.0 mg CT/g)\u2014mainly flavonoid molecules (34.0 mg CT/g) and phenolic acids (50.8 mg CT /g) [20]. These compounds can impart OMW suitable antioxidant properties, which have been deeply investigated by scavenger activity measures against hydrophilic and lipophilic radical species. Specifically, the inhibition kinetic studies returned an IC50 value against the ABTS radical (0.019 mg mL\u22121) that was nearly five times lower compared to the activity against lipophilic species (DPPH). The experimental parameters applied during the vegetable matrix extraction (i.e., pH, time, type of solvent, and concentration) are critical parameters for the activity of the phenols-containing extracts. Phenolic compounds are usually soluble in polar protic solvents such as ethanol or methanol. However, phenolic acids such as gallic, cinnamic, and coumaric acids are soluble in water as well as in dichloromethane or acetone. For these reasons, several studies proposed mixtures consisting of ethanol and water in different proportions for the extraction of bioactive compounds from OMW [21]. ELAVF was subjected to an extraction process by maceration using different solvents with different polarity, including ethanol, acetone, dichloromethane, n-hexane and hydroalcoholic solution (10/90 v/v). To improve the extraction process, a second reflux method, i.e., Soxhlet apparatus, was proposed. It represents a valid alternative method to increase the extraction yields [22]. The extraction conditions used, together with the process yields, expressed as grams of dry substance obtained, and the evaluation of the phenolic profile, are described in Table 1. Particularly, ELAVF5S (52.10%) and ELAVF1S (25.60%) provided higher extraction yields. The extraction data analysis showed that the Soxhlet process returned the best results in terms of yields compared to the maceration technique. Colorimetric assays were used to explore the presence of active compounds in the extracts and to correlate them to the antioxidant performances of the matrices. The comparison between the values of the quantities of available phenolic groups, recorded for the different extracts on the basis of a single type of solvent used, appeared higher for the samples obtained using the reflux extraction technique with the exception of the sample obtained using dichloromethane. The obtained extracts were richer in polyphenolic compounds when the extraction process was carried out in the presence of ethanol (94.16 mg CT/g extract, for ELAVF1S), which was followed by acetone (28.98 mg CT/g extract, for ELAVF2S) and the ethanol\u2013water mixture (90/10 v/v) (22.93 mg CT/g extract, for ELAVF5S). The antioxidant profiles of the extracts were investigated by employing the same colorimetric tests used for the raw matrix. All experiments confirmed TPC results, highlighting as ELAVF1S is the best performed extract. The ethanol extract ELAVF1S showed a greater quantity of available phenolic groups (94.16 mg CT/g of extract) as well as a high amount of phenolic acids and flavonoids, showing percentages equal to 69.9% and 66.0% of the total polyphenols, respectively (Table 2).\nInt.

The ability of ELAVF1S to inhibit DPPH and ABTS radicals, expressed in terms of IC50 (mg mL\u22121), is shown in Table 2. The IC50 value of the ELAVF1S sample showed a difference of almost an order of magnitude recorded in the scavenging activity in an aqueous environment compared to the organic one.\nInt. J. Mol.

The extraction of polyphenols depends on their diffusion into the extraction solvent, which is determined either by their structure or by their interactions with other matrix components. In this work, ethanol was chosen as the solvent because, relating to lyophilized olive mill wastewater, lower molecular weight polyphenols can be sufficiently extracted with simple alcohols or a hydroalcoholic mixture [23]. Overall, the collected data displayed that the HT and its glucoside isomers (7.1 \u00b1 0.6, 21.2\u00b1 1.9, and 12.1\u00b1 1.1 \u00b5g mL\u22121) were recognized as having the same [M\u2013H]\u2212 at m/z 315.

This waste is from Olea Europea Roggianella cv; it was harvested in October and immediately processed using the traditional method Enorossi 150 working at 150 kg of olives. Several samples of 50 mL each were stored at \u221250 \u25e6C before the analysis. OMW (200 mL) has been filtered thought Whatman paper No. 3 and centrifugated (3 times) for 10 min at 10,000 rpm. The liquid phase was freeze-dried and furnished as a brown dry solid (ELAVF) that was stored at +4 \u25e6C until using. The extracts were obtained via two methods: maceration, (0.5 g of ELAFV) employing ethanol, acetone, n-hexane, and dichloromethane as solvents (40 mL), and Soxhlet, (1 g of ELAVF) at reflux for 5 h, employing ethanol, acetone, dichloromethane, and ethanol/water (90:10) as solvents (100 mL). After the extraction, all the extracts (ELAVF) were filtered on Whatman paper No. 3, freeze dried and stored at +4 \u25e6C until the analysis.\n3.4. Extracts Characterization 3.4.1. Colorimetric Assays\nThe extracts were analyzed by the evaluation of total phenolic, phenolic acid, flavonoid, and anthocyanin concentrations, whereas their antioxidant performances were evaluated by scavenger tests against hydrophilic and lipophilic radical species.\nTotal Phenolic Content Determination\nThe total phenolic content (TPC) was evaluated by the Folin\u2013Ciocalteu assay following a procedure found in the literature with some modifications [27] as reported in the SI section. The TPC values of each extract were expressed as weight of CT per gram of sample (mg CT/g sample).\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 15075 16 of 22\nTotal Phenolic Acid Determination\nFor the evaluation of the total content of phenolic acids (PAC), the Arnov test with some changes was used [28] (see the SI section for details). The PAC values were expressed as the weight of CT per gram of sample (mg CT/g sample) after having carried out the relative calibration line.\nFlavonoid Content Determination\nThe total flavonoid content (FC) of each extract was evaluated by a method reported in the literature with some modifications [27] (see the SI section for details). The FC values were expressed as the weight of CT per gram of sample (mg CT/g sample) after carrying out a suitable calibration curve.\nTotal Antioxidant Capacity\nA literature protocol with a few changes was employed to determine the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) of each extract [29]. The total antioxidant activity of each matrix was expressed as the CT equivalent concentration (mg CT/g sample).\nScavenger Activity against DPPH Radical\nThe scavenging activities in the organic environment were evaluated in terms of reduction of the radical 2,2\u2032-diphenyl-1-picrilhydrazyl (DPPH), using the procedure re-ported in the literature with some changes [30] (see the SI section for details). The scavenging activity on the lipophilic DPPH radical was expressed in terms of IC50.\nScavenger Activity against ABTS Radical\nThe scavenging activities in the aqueous medium were determined in terms of reduction of the radical species 2,2\u2032-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazolin-6-sulphonic) (ABTS), as reported in the literature with some changes [31] (see the SI section for details). The scavenging activity of the analyzed system was expressed in terms of IC50.\n3.4.2. HPLC-MS/MS Analysis of ELAVF\nThe chromatographic separation of polyphenols in the ELAVF extracts was conducted by using an HPLC 1100 system equipped with a degasser, quaternary pump solvent delivery, thermostatic column compartment, autosampler, single wavelength UV-Vis detector, and MSD triple quadrupole QQQ 6430 in a series configuration (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Specifically, the lyophilized ELAVFs were resuspended in 2 mL of the extraction solvent to a final concentration of ~1.2 mg mL\u22121 and filtered through 0.2 \u00b5m pore-size regenerated cellulose filters (VWR International Srl, Milano, Italy). Then, 3 \u00b5L of each sample (analyzed in triplicate) was injected into a reversed stationary phase column, Luna C18 (150 \u00d7 2 mm i.d., particle size 3 \u00b5m, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) protected by a C18 Guard Cartridge (4.0 \u00d7 2.0 mm i.d., Phenomenex), and a binary mobile phase composed of (solvent A) H2O/formic acid 0.1% (v/v) and (solvent B) acetonitrile (Chromasolv, VWR International Srl, Milano, Italy) was employed with the following gradient: 0 min, 10% B; 1 min, 10% B; 15 min, 30% B; 22 min, 50% B; 28 min, 100% B; 34 min, 100% B; 36 min, 10% B. The column temperature was controlled at 20 \u25e6C, and the flow was maintained at 0.4 mL min\u22121. The UV-Vis detection wavelength was set at 280 nm. Mass Hunter Workstation software (version B.01.04; Agilent Technologies) was employed to acquire and process MS and MS/MS data in negative ionization mode (m/z 50\u20131200) by setting the capillary voltage at 4000 V and nitrogen as drying (T = 350 \u25e6C; flow rate = 9 L min\u22121) and nebulizing gas (40 psi). Compound identification was achieved by matching different information, such as UV absorption, retention times (RTs), elution order, and mass spectra (MS and MS/MS), with those already reported in the literature [20,32]. The revealed compounds were quantified by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM), and their concentrations were expressed as \u00b5g mL\u22121 of HT equivalents (concentration range 0.01125\u201310 \u00b5g mL\u22121; R2 = 0.99923).\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 15075 17 of 22\n3.4.3.

The test was performed on THP-1 cells, evaluating the modulation of the expression of two costimulatory molecules, CD54 and CD86, using nickel sulfate (NiSO4) as a positive control. An increased expression of CD54 and CD86 on monocytes correlates with the activation of an immune response following exposure to a partially allergenic antigen.

Ethanolic extract of OMW rich in valuable secondary metabolites, mainly HT, was successfully linked by an enzymatic transesterification using porcine pancreatic lipase, as demonstrated by ESI MS/MS spectra, to obtain a functional polymer able to promote proliferative fibroblasts activity in an in vitro scratch assay and showing a safe profile, thanks to the absence of sensitization and hemolysis. Furthermore, treatment with PELAVF1S on fibroblast (BJ cells) and keratinocytes (HaCaT cells) showed a proliferative and healing effect, as demonstrated by cell viability and motility assays. Our results highlighted how PELAVF1S stimulates in HaCaT cells the Lumican expression, which is a small leucine-rich proteoglycan expressed in the extracellular matrices of several tissues. Lumican regulates collagen fibrillogenesis and keratinocyte phenotypes and appears to be involved in inflammatory cell extravasation and angiogenesis, both being central in the wound-healing process [40]. The results obtained demonstrated that the treatment with PELAVF1S increased the expression of\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 15075 20 of 22\nLumican.
