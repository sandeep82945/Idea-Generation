    "abstractText": "The Bayesian statistical paradigm provides a principled and coherent approach to probabilistic forecasting. Uncertainty about all unknowns that characterize any forecasting problem \u2013 model, parameters, latent states \u2013 is able to be quantified explicitly, and factored into the forecast distribution via the process of integration or averaging. Allied with the elegance of the method, Bayesian forecasting is now underpinned by the burgeoning field of Bayesian computation, which enables Bayesian forecasts to be produced for virtually any problem, no matter how large, or complex. The current state of play in Bayesian forecasting in economics and finance is the subject of this review. The aim is to provide the reader with an overview of modern approaches to the field, set in some historical context; and with sufficient computational detail given to assist the reader with implementation.",

            "heading": "1.1 Why Bayesian forecasting?",
            "text": "The Bayesian statistical paradigm uses the rules and language of probability to quantify uncertainty about all unknown aspects of phenomena that generate observed data. This core characteristic of the paradigm makes it particularly suitable for forecasting, with uncertainty about the unknown values of future observations automatically expressed in terms of a probability distribution. Moreover, Bayesian methods \u2013 in principle \u2013 allow a user to seamlessly, and systematically, yield probabilistic forecasts that reflect uncertainty about all unknowns and that, as a consequence, condition primarily on known past events, or data: a feature that Geweke and Whiteman (2006) refer to as the principle of relevant conditioning.\nIndeed, the ability of Bayesian forecasters to appropriately incorporate the uncertainty associated with the production of forecasts, while utilizing all available information \u2013 both a priori and sample information \u2013 in a principled manner, led Granger et al. (1986) to conclude that:\n\u201cIn terms of forecasting accuracy a good Bayesian will beat a non-Bayesian,\nwho will do better than a bad Bayesian.\u201d\nEchoing these sentiments, in our opinion, the power of the Bayesian forecasting paradigm is a product of the paradigm\u2019s ability to treat all elements of the statistical problem necessary to produce forecasts \u2013 future observations, past observations, parameters, latent variables, models \u2013 as arguments of a joint probability distribution. The express probabilistic formulation of these elements, in turn, allows a Bayesian to invoke the standard rules of probability to produce a distribution for an unknown future value that is conditioned on the known past data, and is marginal of other arguments that are inherently unknown.\nWhile this ability to marginalize all unknowns through probability calculus is the hallmark of the Bayesian approach, the benefits of the paradigm, and what ultimately in our opinion defines a \u2018good Bayesian\u2019, is the attention to detail necessary to successfully implement Bayesian methods. In Bayesian forecasting, before we ever attempt to produce a forecast, we must first carefully enumerate all possible sources of uncertainty \u2013 including, where possible, the set of alternative forecasting models; and construct reasonable prior beliefs for these quantities, which often include (possibly several layers of) latent variables that have a specific and delicate interaction with the observed data; always taking great care to ensure that these prior beliefs do not conflict with the observed data. Then and only then can we \u2018turn the Bayesian crank\u2019 to produce the joint posterior distribution over all unknown quantities (including future values), and ultimately integrate out the quantities we are not interested in to obtain the (posterior) predictive distribution for the future values of our random variables of interest. The attention to detail necessary to produce Bayesian forecasts aims to reduce the number of implicit maintained assumptions, and what explicit assumptions are maintained (e.g. the conditioning on a particular model, or finite model set) can often be rationalized/tested against the data.\nConsistent with the internal coherence of the Bayesian statistical paradigm, the basic manner in which all Bayesian forecasting problems are framed is the same. What differs however, from case to case, is\nthe way in which the problem is solved \u2013 i.e. the way in which the forecast distribution is accessed. To understand why this is so, it is sufficient to recognize that virtually all Bayesian quantities of interest, including forecast distributions, can be expressed as expectations of some sort. For most models that are used to predict empirically relevant data these expectations are not available in closed form. Hence, in any practical problem, implementation of Bayesian forecasting is both model- and data-dependent, and relies on advanced computational tools. Different forecasting problems \u2013 defined by different forms and \u2018sizes\u2019 of models and data sets \u2013 require, in turn, different approaches to computation. The evolution of the practice of Bayesian forecasting has, as a consequence, gone hand-in-hand with developments on the computational front; with increasingly large and complex models rendered amenable to a Bayesian forecasting approach via access to modern techniques of computation."

            "heading": "1.2 The purview of this review",
            "text": "In this review, we give a modern take on the current landscape of Bayesian forecasting. Whilst excellent textbook treatments of Bayesian forecasting are given in Geweke (2005) and West and Harrison (2006), and with Geweke and Whiteman (2006) reviewing specific aspects of Bayesian forecasting in a slew of practical settings, the field has advanced by leaps and bounds in the last twenty years. Therefore, we believe the time is ripe to consider a review of the subject that touches on many of the novel and exciting areas now being explored. The methodological advances we review have general applicability to all discipline areas; nevertheless, due to our own interests, expertise and experience \u2013 and to keep the scope of the paper manageable \u2013 we have chosen to focus primarily on applications in the economic sciences. Whilst the paper is not designed to be a treatise on Bayesian computation, sufficient details are provided to enable the practitioner to understand why numerical tools are needed in most forecasting settings, and how they are used.\nThe general structure of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we provide a short tutorial on Bayesian forecasting. This begins with an outline of the Bayesian forecasting method, followed by an overview of the computational techniques used to implement the method. In Section 3 we then take the reader on a potted chronological tour of Bayesian forecasting, up to the present day. We begin by giving a snapshot of the forecasting problems tackled during the last decade of the 20th century (and the early years of the 21st), and the computational solutions that were adopted then \u2013 most notably, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. We then look at the types of \u2018intractable\u2019 forecasting problems that are increasingly encountered in the 21st century, and provide an overview of the new computational solutions that have been proposed to tackle such problems. We also outline very recent developments in which misspecification of the forecasting model is explicitly acknowledged, and conventional likelihood-based Bayesian forecasting eschewed as a consequence; with problem-specific measures of forecast accuracy (or forecast loss) used, instead, to drive the production of forecast distributions. Section 4 then provides the reader with more detailed reviews of contemporary Bayesian forecasting in the following four broad fields: macroeconomics, finance, marketing, and electricity pricing and demand. Section 5 closes the paper with a brief summary of the current state of play.\nBefore proceeding further, we make a note about scope and language. To render the scope of the paper manageable we focus primarily on Bayesian forecasting in \u2018time series models\u2019 \u2013 i.e. models for\nrandom variables that are indexed by time \u2013 and on using such models to say something about the values that these random variables will assume in the future. These future values may be informed only by past observations on the variable, or may also depend on the known values of covariates, or regressors. We also follow the convention in the Bayesian literature by using the terms \u2018forecast\u2019 and \u2018prediction\u2019 (and all of their various grammatical derivations) synonymously and interchangeably in this case, for the sake of linguistic variety. The fundamental principles of Bayesian prediction apply equally to data indexed by something other than time. The term \u2018forecast\u2019 is not used in this case as it is a term reserved for temporal settings. The main exceptions to our focus on time series models, and forecasting per se, occur in Section 4.3, in which models for cross-sectional data are used to predict customer choice in marketing settings, and Section 4.4, in which models for electricity demand that have a spatial dimension are referenced."

Using the same symbol y1:T to denote both the vector of observed data and the T -dimensional vector random variable, we define the joint distribution over y1:T and \u03b8 as p(y1:T ,\u03b8). Application of the standard rules of probability to p(y1:T ,\u03b8) yields Bayes theorem (or Bayes rule),\np(\u03b8|y1:T ) = p(y1:T |\u03b8)p(\u03b8)\np(y1:T ) , (1)\nwhere p(y1:T ) = \u222b \u0398 p(y1:T |\u03b8)p(\u03b8)d\u03b8. Bayes theorem provides a representation for the posterior probability density function (pdf) for \u03b8, p(\u03b8|y1:T ), as proportional to the product of the likelihood function and the prior. The term p(y1:T ) defines the marginal likelihood, and the scale factor [p(y1:T )] \u22121 in (1) ensures that p(\u03b8|y1:T ) integrates to one. Now, define yT+1 as the (one-step-ahead) future random variable, where we focus on one-step-ahead forecasting in Sections 2 and 3 merely to simplify the exposition. Assuming yT+1 to be a continuous random variable (again, for illustration), standard probability manipulations lead to the following expression for the forecast (or predictive) pdf for yT+1 :\np(yT+1|y1:T ) = \u222b\n\u0398 p(yT+1|\u03b8,y1:T )p(\u03b8|y1:T )d\u03b8. (2)\nWhen no confusion arises, we also refer to p(yT+1|y1:T ), albeit loosely, as the forecast (or predictive) distribution, or simply as the \u2018predictive\u2019.1 The density p(yT+1|y1:T ) summarizes all uncertainty about\n1We note that p(yT+1|y1:T ) is sometimes referred to as a \u2018posterior\u2019 predictive in the literature, given that it is produced by averaging the conditional predictive, p(yT+1|\u03b8,y1:T ), with respect to the posterior density, p(\u03b8|y1:T ). We do not adopt this expression, leaving it to the context to make it clear as to whether the term \u2018predictive\u2019 is being used to refer to the distribution that is marginal of \u03b8, p(yT+1|y1:T ), or that which is conditioned on \u03b8, p(yT+1|\u03b8,y1:T ). We also streamline the exposition by not using explicit notation for any observed covariates on which the model for yt may depend, and on which the predictive for yT+1 would condition, unless this is essential.\nyT+1, conditional on the assumed model \u2013 which underpins the structure of both the conditional predictive, p(yT+1|\u03b8,y1:T ), and the posterior itself \u2013 and the prior beliefs that inform p(\u03b8|y1:T ). Point and interval predictions of yT+1, and indeed any other distributional summary, can be extracted from (2). In the case where the model itself is uncertain, and a finite set of parametric models, M1, M2,...,MK , is assumed to span the model space, a \u2018model-averaged\u2019 predictive (e.g. Raftery et al., 1997, Section 2), pMA(yT+1|y1:T ), is produced as\npMA(yT+1|y1:T ) = K \u2211\nk=1\np(yT+1|y1:T ,Mk)p(Mk|y1:T ), (3)\nwhere p(yT+1|y1:T ,Mk) denotes the density in (2), but now conditioned explicitly on the kth model in the set. The kth posterior model probability, p(Mk|y1:T ), k = 1, 2, ...,K, is computed via a further application of Bayes theorem in which the (initial) joint distribution of interest is defined over both the model space and the space for the parameters of each of the K models. Standard manipulations lead to\np(Mk|y1:T ) \u221d p(y1:T |Mk)p(Mk), (4)\nwhere\np(y1:T |Mk) = \u222b\n\u0398k\np(y1:T |\u03b8k,Mk)p(\u03b8k|Mk)d\u03b8k, (5)\nfor each k = 1, 2, ...,K, with \u03b8k denoting the parameter set for the kth model.\nAs is clear, analytical evaluation of p(yT+1|y1:T ) in (2) requires, at the very least, a closed-form expression for p(\u03b8|y1:T ). Typically, however, such an expression is not available, with most posteriors being known only up to a constant of proportionality, as\np(\u03b8|y1:T ) \u221d p(y1:T |\u03b8)p(\u03b8). (6)\nThe main exceptions to this occur when p(y1:T |\u03b8) is from the exponential family, and either a natural conjugate, or convenient noninformative prior is adopted; specifications which may be suitable for some simple (and low-dimensional) empirical problems, but are certainly not broadly applicable in practice. Analytical evaluation of pMA(yT+1|y1:T ) in (3) also requires a closed-form expression for each p(y1:T |Mk) (with normalization of p(Mk|y1:T ) then straightforward); once again a rare thing beyond the exponential family (and standard prior) setting. Hence the need for numerical computation to implement Bayesian forecasting in virtually all realistic empirical problems.2"

            "text": "The form of (2) makes it clear that the Bayesian predictive pdf, p(yT+1|y1:T ), is nothing more than the posterior expectation of the predictive that conditions on \u03b8. Hence, accessing p(yT+1|y1:T ) amounts to the evaluation of an expectation. This insight is helpful, as it enables us to see many of the computational methods that are used to access p(yT+1|y1:T ) \u2013 in cases where it is not available in closed form \u2013 simply as different ways of numerically estimating an expectation.\n2Numerous textbook illustrations of the material in this section can be found. In addition to Geweke (2005) and West and Harrison (2006) as cited above, some examples are Zellner (1971), Koop (2003) and Robert (2007). We also refer the reader to Steel (2020) for a recent review of Bayesian model averaging in economics.\nIt is convenient to group Bayesian computational methods into three categories: (i) deterministic integration (or quadrature) methods (Davis and Rabinowitz, 1975; Naylor and Smith, 1982); (ii) exact simulation methods; and (iii) approximate methods. Given that the production of p(yT+1|y1:T ) involves integration over \u03b8, only in very low-dimensional models is (i) a feasible computational approach on its own, due to the well-known \u2018curse of dimensionality\u2019 that characterizes numerical quadrature. Hence, the computational methods in (ii) and (iii) are those most commonly adopted, and will be our focus here; noting that quadrature may play still a limited role within these alternative computational frameworks.\nThe methods in (ii) use simulation to produce M draws of \u03b8, \u03b8(i), i = 1, 2, ...,M , from the posterior p(\u03b8|y1:T ), which, in turn, define M conditional predictives, p(yT+1|\u03b8(i),y1:T ), i = 1, 2, ...,M , the mean of which is used to estimate (2). Alternatively, if it is easier to simulate from p(yT+1|\u03b8(i),y1:T ) than to evaluate it at any point in the support of yT+1, M draws of yT+1, y (i) T+1, i = 1, 2, ...,M , are taken, one for each draw \u03b8(i), and kernel density estimation methods used to produce an estimate of p(yT+1|y1:T ). Different simulation methods are distinguished by the way in which the posterior draws are produced. Methods in (ii) include Monte Carlo sampling (Metropolis and Ulam, 1949), importance sampling (IS) (Hammersley and Handscomb, 1964; Kloek and van Dijk, 1978; Geweke, 1989) and MCMC sampling \u2013 including Gibbs sampling (Geman and Geman, 1984; Gelfand and Smith, 1990) and Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithms (Metropolis et al., 1953; Hastings, 1970) \u2013 with MCMC being by far the most common simulation method used to compute forecast distributions in practice. The term \u2018exact\u2019 arises from the fact that, under appropriate conditions (including convergence of the Markov chain to p(\u03b8|y1:T ) in the case of the MCMC algorithms), such methods all produce a \u221a M -consistent estimate of the ordinate p(yT+1|y1:T ), at any point in the support of the random variable yT+1; this estimate can thus be rendered arbitrarily accurate, for large enough M.\nWe refer the reader to: Chib and Greenberg (1996) and Geyer (2011) for reviews of MCMC sampling; Casella and George (1992) and Chib and Greenberg (1995) for descriptions of the Gibbs and MH algorithms (respectively) that are useful for practitioners; and Andrieu et al. (2004), Robert and Casella (2011) and Martin et al. (2023b) for historical accounts of MCMC sampling. Geweke and Whiteman (2006) also serves as an excellent reference on the use of these computational methods in a forecasting context. Given the critical role played by MCMC methods in the production of Bayesian forecasts, the basic principles of the algorithms are also outlined below in Section 3.1; with more recent developments of both IS and MCMC \u2013 most notably sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) (Gordon et al., 1993; Chopin and Papaspiliopoulos, 2020) and pseudo-marginal MCMC (Beaumont, 2003; Andrieu and Roberts, 2009; Andrieu et al., 2011) \u2013 discussed briefly in Section 3.2.\nThe methods in (iii) replace p(\u03b8|y1:T ) in the integrand of (2) with an approximation of some sort, and evaluate the resultant integral. In so doing, such methods do not aim to estimate p(yT+1|y1:T ) itself, but some representation of it, defined as the expectation of p(yT+1|\u03b8,y1:T ) with respect to the relevant posterior approximation. The methods in (iii) have been based on the principles of approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) (Marin et al., 2011; Sisson and Fan, 2011; Sisson et al., 2019), Bayesian synthetic likelihood (BSL) (Price et al., 2018), variational Bayes (VB) (Blei et al., 2017), and integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) (Rue et al., 2009), and produce what are termed \u2018approximate\u2019 forecast, or predictive distributions. Suffice to say that the principle adopted for estimating the \u2018approximate\npredictive\u2019 so defined is typically one and the same: draws of \u03b8 from the approximate posterior (however produced) are used to produce either a sample mean of conditional predictives, or M draws of yT+1 from p(yT+1|\u03b8,y1:T ), with kernel density estimation then applied. The production of (3) requires the computation of each model-specific predictive, plus the computation of each (5). The first set of K computations would proceed via the sorts of steps outlined above. Computation of the K marginal likelihoods could also be performed via one of the three broad methods listed above (in particular (ii) or (iii)); however, the fact that each (5) is a prior, rather than a posterior expectation does have implications for precise manner in which computation is implemented. (See Ardia et al., 2012, and Llorente et al., 2021, for details)."

While the use of simulation to compute statistical quantities of interest was known by the 1970s (Metropolis and Ulam, 1949; Metropolis et al., 1953; Hammersley and Handscomb, 1964; Hastings, 1970), the technology required to perform simulation in a convenient and timely fashion was not yet available, and simulation-based computation thus remained largely out of reach.

To this end, we give a brief outline of the pre-eminent posterior simulation algorithms of the 1990s (and the early 2000s): Gibbs sampling (Section 3.1.1), MH-within-Gibbs sampling (Section 3.1.2), and (MH-within-) Gibbs sampling allied with data augmentation (Section 3.1.3); touching on the types of forecasting models that were able to be treated via such methods, most notably the ubiquitous state space models that underpin much modern Bayesian forecasting.

IS (Kloek and van Dijk, 1978; Geweke, 1989), via use of an \u2018importance\u2019 or \u2018proposal\u2019 density, q(\u03b8|y1:T ), that matches p(\u03b8|y1:T ) well and which can be drawn from, is a possible solution in some cases. However, the algorithm can fail to produce representative draws from p(\u03b8|y1:T ) when the dimension of \u03b8 is large, due to the difficulty of finding a q(\u03b8|y1:T ) that is a \u2018good match\u2019 to p(\u03b8|y1:T ) in high dimensions.\nIn contrast, under certain conditions, a Gibbs sampler is able to produce a (dependent) set of draws from the joint posterior via iterative sampling from lower dimensional, and often standard, conditional posteriors. In other words, a Gibbs sampler takes advantage of the fact that, while joint and marginal posterior distributions are usually complex in form and unable to be simulated from directly, conditional posteriors are often standard and amenable to simulation. Given the satisfaction of the required convergence conditions (Geyer, 2011), draws \u03b8(i), i = 1, 2, ...,M , produced via iterative sampling from the full conditionals converge in distribution to p(\u03b8|y1:T ) as M \u2192 \u221e, and can be used to produce a\u221a M -consistent estimate of the ordinates of p(yT+1|y1:T ) across the support of yT+1 in the manner described in Section 2.2. Decisions about how to partition, or \u2018block\u2019 \u03b8 need to be made (Liu et al., 1994; Roberts and Sahu, 1997), with a view to increasing the \u2018efficiency\u2019 of the chain which, in effect, amounts to ensuring an accurate estimate of p(yT+1|y1:T ) for a given number of draws, M. (See Algorithm 1 in Appendix A.1.)\nChib (1993) and McCulloch and Tsay (1994) are the earliest examples of using Gibbs algorithms for Bayesian estimation and prediction in time series settings; both papers exploiting the fact that despite p(\u03b8|y1:T ) and p(yT+1|y1:T ) precluding analytical treatment in most of the examples considered, the conditional posteriors always have closed forms. As one would anticipate however, a \u2018pure\u2019 Gibbs algorithm based on a full set of standard conditionals is not always possible, with the more typical situation being one in which one or more of the conditionals \u2013 associated with any given partitioning of the parameter space \u2013 are not available in closed form. The following section describes how to adapt a Gibbs algorithm in cases where certain conditional components are not known in closed form, and, in so doing, illustrates a powerful simulation-based algorithm for accessing p(yT+1|y1:T ) in more complex settings."

The Metropolis algorithm was subsequently generalized by Hastings (1970), and it is this \u2018MH\u2019 version of the method that is typically referenced. For the purpose of this review, the key role of the MH algorithm is to enable sampling from non-standard conditionals within a Gibbs algorithm, in particular when the dimension of the conditionals precludes (say) the exclusive use of inverse cumulative distribution function (ICDF) sampling.4\nUnder regularity, a Markov chain that converges to p(\u03b8|y1:T ) can be produced by embedding an MH algorithm (or MH algorithms) within an outer Gibbs loop. In short, an MH-within-Gibbs algorithm proceeds by drawing from any non-standard conditional indirectly, via a \u2018candidate\u2019, or \u2018proposal\u2019 distri-\n3For example, Dongarra and Sullivan (2000) rank the Metropolis algorithm proposed in Metropolis et al. as one of the 10 algorithms \u201cwith the greatest influence on the development and practice of science and engineering in the 20th century\u201d.\n4Any non-standard probability distribution can, in principle, be drawn from using ICDF sampling.

Given that the method amounts to the use of numerical quadrature, it suffers from the curse of dimensionality, and is thus infeasible for drawing from anything other than very low-dimensional conditionals.

Critically, the formula that defines the acceptance probability involves evaluation of the non-standard conditional only up to its integrating constant; hence the conditional need not be known in its entirety.5 Again, under appropriate regularity, the draws \u03b8(i), i = 1, 2, ...,M , from the MHwithin-Gibbs algorithm converge in distribution to p(\u03b8|y1:T ) as M \u2192 \u221e, and can be used to produce a\u221a M -consistent estimate of the ordinates of p(yT+1|y1:T ). (See Algorithm 2 in Appendix A.2.) As will become evident in the subsequent empirical review sections, MH-within-Gibbs algorithms remain the dominant form of method used to sample from posteriors \u2013 and to estimate predictive distributions \u2013 for time series models for which a convenient partitioning of the parameter space is available, and for which the conditional posteriors are known up to their integrating constants. Hence, we reserve further elaboration on the use of such algorithms in practice until the appropriate points in Section 4."

The latent states may be intrinsic to the model \u2013 as in a state space model \u2013 or may be auxiliary variables introduced purely for the purpose of facilitating posterior sampling. Application of a Gibbs-based MCMC scheme to the joint, or \u2018augmented\u2019 set of unknowns (\u03b8, z1:T ) is often referred to as \u2018data augmentation\u2019, in the spirit of Tanner and Wong (1987), and such schemes have enabled the Bayesian analysis of large classes of time series models that would otherwise have been inaccessible.\nWe illustrate here the basic principles of the approach using a state space model governed by a measurement density for the observed scalar random variable, yt, and a Markov transition density for a scalar state variable, zt,\np(yt|zt,\u03b8) (7) p(zt|zt\u22121,\u03b8).

(9)\nIn certain cases, the model structure is such that a pure Gibbs scheme can be used to produce draws from p(\u03b8, z1:T |y1:T ) and, thus, from p(\u03b8|y1:T ); an insight obtained independently by Carter and Kohn (1994) and Fru\u0308hwirth-Schnatter (1994) for the case of the linear Gaussian state-space model, for example. However, implementation of such a scheme will, by definition, require both p(\u03b8|z1:T ,y1:T ) and p(z1:T |\u03b8,y1:T ) to have recognizable forms. In more general cases, in which either the measurement or state equation has non-linear and/or non-Gaussian features, the resulting conditionals will not necessarily have a known closed form, which necessitates the addition of MH steps within the outer Gibbs loop.\n5Moreover, and in contrast to IS, the requirement to find a well-matched proposal distribution is facilitated by the dimension reduction invoked by the breaking down of the high-dimensional joint posterior into the lower dimensional conditionals, before any proposal distribution needs to be specified.\nSuch a treatment was the method of attack for large classes of models in the 1990s and early 2000s. Relevant contributions here, which include specific treatments of the ubiquitous stochastic volatility (SV) model, are Polson et al. (1992), Jacquier et al. (1994), Shephard and Pitt (1997), Kim et al. (1998), Chib et al. (2002), Stroud et al. (2003), Chib et al. (2006), Strickland et al. (2006), Omori et al. (2007) and Strickland et al. (2008).

Nevertheless, more ambitious forecasting problems are now being tackled, and this has tested the mettle of some of the early algorithms. As a consequence, Bayesian forecasters have begun to exploit more modern computational techniques, and it is those techniques that we touch on briefly in this section.\nIt is convenient to characterize these newer computational developments as different types of solutions to so-called \u2018intractable\u2019 forecasting problems, by which we mean: (a) forecasts based on models with data generating processes (DGPs) that cannot be readily expressed as a pdf, or probability mass function (pmf); (b) forecasts based on high-dimensional models, with a very large number of unknowns; (c) forecasts produced using extremely large data sets. Problems that feature problem (a) are referred to as doubly-intractable problems, as not only is p(\u03b8|y1:T ) not available in its entirety (as is typical), but the DGP itself is also not able to be expressed analytically.\nWith reference to (a), the MCMC methods referenced so far entail the evaluation of the DGP as a pd(/m)f, either in the calculation of the acceptance probability in any MH sub-step, or in the specification of full conditionals in any \u2018pure\u2019 Gibbs step. Hence, they are infeasible when DGPs do not admit such a representation. Many such DGPs exist (see, for example, Martin et al., 2023a, for a list of examples); however, particularly pertinent ones to mention here are continuous time models in finance with unknown transition densities (Gallant and Tauchen, 1996), \u03b1-stable models for financial returns (and/or their volatility) (Peters et al., 2012; Martin et al., 2019), and stochastic dynamic equilibrium models in economics (Calvet and Czellar, 2015). With regard to (b), whilst, in principle (and under appropriate regularity), a convergent MCMC chain can be constructed for any model, the exploration of a very highdimensional parameter space via an MCMC algorithm can be prohibitively slow (Tavare\u0301 et al., 1997;\n6We also note here the work of Chib and Greenberg (1994), in which the state space representation of an autoregressive moving average (ARMA(p,q)) model (Harvey, 1981) was exploited, and the principle of data augmentation invoked, in order to enable an MH-within-Gibbs scheme to be applied.\nRue et al., 2009; Braun and McAuliffe, 2010; Lintusaari et al., 2017; Betancourt, 2018; Johndrow et al., 2019). Hence, in models with a very large number of unknowns \u2013 including those with multiple sets of latent variables \u2013 the production of an accurate MCMC-based estimate of p(yT+1|y1:T ) in a practical amount of time may not be possible. Finally, regarding (c) MCMC schemes require pointwise (i.e. for each yt) evaluation of p(y1:T |\u03b8) at each draw of \u03b8, thereby inducing an O(T ) computational burden at each iteration in an MCMC chain.7 Such schemes can thus struggle when confronted with \u2018big data\u2019 (Bardenet et al., 2017). In this context, \u2018big data\u2019 refers to situations where, due to the length and/or size of the data set, the repeated evaluation of the likelihood function that is required to produce draws from the corresponding MCMC chain is too time consuming for the algorithm to run in a reasonable amount of time.\nThe methods in the following sections have been designed to solve one or more of these instances of intractability. The techniques in Section 3.2.2 do so whilst preserving the \u2018exact\u2019 nature of the estimate of p(yT+1|y1:T ), whilst those in Section 3.2.3 aim to produce an approximation of p(yT+1|y1:T ) only."

The goal of the newer MCMC algorithms \u2013 at their heart \u2013 is to explore the high mass region of the joint posterior more efficiently, in particular when the dimension of the space of unknowns is large. This, in turn, enables a more accurate estimate of p(yT+1|y1:T ) to be produced for a given computational budget. This goal has been achieved via a variety of means, which (in the spirit of Robert et al., 2018, and Martin et al., 2023b) can be summarized as follows: the use of more geometric information about the target posterior, most notably the use of Hamiltonian updates (Neal, 2011b; Hoffman and Gelman, 2014); the use of better MH candidate, or proposal distributions, including those that \u2018adapt\u2019 to previous draws (Nott and Kohn, 2005; Roberts and Rosenthal, 2009); various types of combinations of multiple chains (Jacob et al., 2011; Neal, 2011a; Neiswanger et al., 2013; Glynn and Rhee, 2014; Huber, 2016; Jacob et al., 2020); or the use of ex-post variance reduction methods (Craiu and Meng, 2005; Douc and Robert, 2011; Owen, 2017; Baker et al., 2019). We refer the reader to Green et al. (2015), Robert et al. (2018) and Dunson and Johndrow (2020) for detailed reviews of modern developments in MCMC, and to Jahan et al. (2020) for an overview of the way in which certain of the newer methods manage the problem of scale \u2013 in terms of either the unknowns or the data, or both.\nWhilst not designed expressly to deal with problems of scale, sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods \u2013 which exploit the principles of IS \u2013 have developed in parallel to the expansion of the MCMC stable. Devised initially for the sequential analysis of state space models, via methods of \u2018particle filtering\u2019 (Gordon et al., 1993), SMC methods have evolved into a larger suite of methods used to perform both sequential and non-sequential tasks (Naesseth et al., 2019; Chopin and Papaspiliopoulos, 2020). For the purpose of this review, the most pertinent development is the melding of particle filtering with MCMC in state space settings to produce a particle marginal MH (PMMH) algorithm (Andrieu et al., 2011; Flury and Shephard, 2011; Pitt et al., 2012; Doucet et al., 2015; Deligiannidis et al., 2018). Such\n7We recall that a sequence XT is O(T ) if |XT /T | is bounded as T \u2192 +\u221e.\nalgorithms tackle intractability type (a) in the dichotomy of the previous section, by replacing an \u2018unavailable\u2019 likelihood function by an unbiased estimate \u2013 produced via the particle filter \u2013 in an MH algorithm which, under regularity, retains the posterior p(\u03b8|y1:T ) as its invariant distribution. Given the increasingly important role played by PMMH, a brief algorithmic description of it is included in Algorithm 3 in Appendix A.4.8"

            "text": "In situations in which the dimension, or structure of the forecasting model, or the size of the data set, still precludes the use of either an MCMC or a PMMH approach, an approximate method may be the only computational option. The cost of adopting such a solution is that these methods no longer directly target the exact predictive, p(yT+1|y1:T ); instead, an approximation of p(yT+1|y1:T ) becomes the goal. The spirit of these methods is to approximate p(yT+1|y1:T ) via some feasible approximation to the posterior p(\u03b8|y1:T ). Denoting the posterior approximation generically by g(\u03b8|y1:T ), the resultant approximate predictive can be expressed as\ng(yT+1|y1:T ) = \u222b\n\u0398 p(yT+1|\u03b8,y1:T )g(\u03b8|y1:T )d\u03b8, (11)\nin the case where there are only static unknowns. When the model features both static parameters and time-varying latent parameters, and exploiting the Markov property of the state process in (8), the approximate predictive can be represented as\ng(yT+1|y1:T ) = \u222b\nzT+1\n\u222b\nzT\n\u222b\n\u0398 p(yT+1|zT+1,\u03b8,y1:T )p(zT+1|zT ,\u03b8)p(zT |\u03b8,y1:T )g(\u03b8|y1:T )d\u03b8dzT dzT+1. (12)\nGiven draws of \u03b8 from g(\u03b8|y1:T ), and given an appropriate forward-filtering algorithm to draw from p(zT |\u03b8,y1:T ) when needed, a simulation-based estimate of g(yT+1|y1:T ) can be produced in the usual way, either as a sample mean of the conditional predictives defined by the draws of \u03b8 (and zT+1), or by applying kernel density techniques to the draws of yT+1 from the conditional predictive.\nWith reference to the taxonomy of intractable problems delineated in Section 3.2, the different methods of producing g(\u03b8|y1:T ) (and, hence, g(yT+1|y1:T )) can be categorized according to whether they are being used to obviate (a) or to tackle a problem of scale: (b) and/or (c). Both ABC and BSL avoid the need to evaluate the DGP and, hence, are feasible methods in the doubly-intractable settings of category (a). In brief, both methods require only simulation, not evaluation, of the DGP. The approximation of p(\u03b8|y1:T ) arises, primarily, from the fact that both methods \u2013 in different ways \u2013 degrade the information in the full data set, y1:T , to the information contained in a set of summary statistics, \u03b7(y1:T ). As such, the target becomes the so-called \u2018partial\u2019 posterior for \u03b8, which conditions on \u03b7(y1:T ), rather than y1:T . The quality of the approximation is thus dependent on the informativeness of the summaries, as well as on other forms of approximation invoked in the implementation of the methods.\n8PMMH is actually a special case of the general pseudo-marginal MH technique (also sometimes denoted by the abbreviation \u2018PMMH\u2019), in which a pseudo likelihood, produced \u2013 in some manner or another \u2013 as an unbiased estimator of the true likelihood, is used within an MH algorithm. See, for example, the subsampling methods based on pseudo-marginal MCMC (Bardenet et al., 2017; Quiroz et al., 2018; Quiroz et al., 2019) used expressly to improve the performance of MCMC in the case of a large-dimensional y1:T (i.e. intractability type (c)).\nVanilla versions of both algorithms are provided in Algorithms 4 (Appendix A.5) and 5 (Appendix A.6) respectively.\nIn contrast to ABC and BSL, VB and INLA still target the exact posterior p(\u03b8|y1:T ), but provide approximations that can be computationally convenient when the scale of the empirical problem is large in some sense (so problem (b) and/or problem (c)), often as a consequence of the specification of a high number of latent, or \u2018local\u2019, parameters in the model, in addition to the (usually) smaller set of \u2018global\u2019 parameters (\u03b8 in our notation). Adopting the technique of the calculus of variations, VB produces an approximation of p(\u03b8|y1:T ) that is \u2018closest\u2019 to p(\u03b8|y1:T ) within a chosen variational family, whilst INLA applies a series of nested Laplace approximations (Laplace, 1774; Tierney and Kadane, 1986; Tierney et al., 1989) to a high-dimensional latent Gaussian model to produce an approximation of p(\u03b8|y1:T ). Both VB and INLA exploit state-of-the-art optimization techniques, for the purpose of minimizing the \u2018distance\u2019 between p(\u03b8|y1:T ) and the variational approximation in the case of VB, and for the purpose of producing the mode of the high-dimensional vector of latent states in the case of INLA. The basic principles of VB and INLA are provided in Appendices A.7 and A.8 respectively.\nWe refer the interested reader to Martin et al. (2023a) for an extensive review of all of these approximate Bayesian methods, as well as more complete coverage of the existing literature, including references to in-depth reviews of specific methods. Martin et al. also includes discussion of \u2018hybrid\u2019 methods that mix and match features of more than one computational technique, with the aim of tackling multiple instances of \u2018intractability\u2019 simultaneously.\nRegardless of which approximation method is used, the hope is that the resulting approximate predictive g(yT+1|y1:T ) performs well relative to the inaccessible exact predictive, and that issue is addressed in certain work cited in the empirical reviews in Section 4."

In the following sections we briefly summarize three such approaches, all of which move beyond the conventional likelihood-based Bayesian update, and Mclosed paradigm: seeking to produce accurate predictions without recourse to the assumption of correct model specification."

            "text": "Loaiza-Maya et al. (2021) propose an approach to Bayesian prediction expressly designed for the context of misspecification. In brief, rather than a correct predictive model being assumed, a prior is placed over a class of plausible predictive models. The prior is then updated to a posterior via a sample criterion function that is constructed using a scoring rule (Gneiting and Raftery, 2007) that rewards the type of predictive accuracy (e.g. accurate prediction of extreme values) that is important for the particular empirical problem being tackled. With a criterion function that explicitly captures predictive accuracy replacing the likelihood function in the Bayesian update, the explicit need for correct model specification is avoided.\nFollowing Gneiting and Raftery (2007), and using generic notation, for P a convex class of predictive distributions on (\u2126,F), the predictive accuracy of P \u2208 P can be assessed using a scoring rule S : P \u00d7\u2126 \u2192 R. If the value y eventuates, then the positively-oriented \u2018score\u2019 of the predictive P , is S(P, y). The expected score under the true unknown predictive P0 is defined as\nS(\u00b7, P0) := \u222b\ny\u2208\u2126 S(\u00b7, y)dP0(y). (13)\nA scoring rule is said to be proper relative to P if, for all P,G \u2208 P, S(G,G) \u2265 S(P,G), and is strictly proper, relative to P, if S(G,G) = S(P,G) \u21d0\u21d2 P = G. Scoring rules are important mechanisms as they elicit truth telling within the forecasting exercise: if the true predictive P0 were known, then in terms of forecasting accuracy as measured by the scoring rule S(\u00b7, \u00b7) it would be optimal to use P0. Different scoring rules rewards different forms of predictive accuracy (see Gneiting and Raftery, 2007, Opschoor et al., 2017, and Martin et al., 2022 for expositions); hence the motivation to drive the update by the score that \u2018matters\u2019. Since P0 and the expected score S(\u00b7, P0) are unattainable in practice, an estimate based on y1:T is used to define the sample criterion, ST (\u03b8) := \u2211T\u22121 t=0 S[p(yt+1|\u03b8,y1:t), yt+1], where p(yt+1|\u03b8,y1:t) is the pdf associated with a given P. Adopting the exponential updating rule proposed by Bissiri et al. (2016) (see also Giummole\u0300 et al., 2017, Holmes and Walker, 2017, Guedj, 2019, Lyddon et al., 2019, and Syring and Martin, 2019), Loaiza-Maya et al. (2021) define the generalized (or Gibbs) posterior:\n\u03c0w(\u03b8|y1:T ) = exp [wST (\u03b8)] \u03c0(\u03b8) \u222b\n\u0398 exp [wST (\u03b8)] \u03c0(\u03b8)d\u03b8 , (14)\nfor some learning rate \u03c9 \u2265 0, calibrated in a preliminary step. This posterior explicitly places high weight on \u2013 or focuses on \u2013 values of \u03b8 that yield high predictive accuracy in the scoring rule S(\u00b7, \u00b7). As such, the process of building a Bayesian predictive as:\npw(yT+1|y1:T ) = \u222b\n\u0398 p(yT+1|\u03b8,y1:T )\u03c0w(\u03b8|y1:T )d\u03b8, (15)\nis termed \u2018focused Bayesian prediction\u2019 (FBP) by the authors. By construction, when the predictive model, p(yT+1|\u03b8,y1:T ), is misspecified, (15) will \u2013 out-of-sample \u2013 often outperform, in the chosen rule S(\u00b7, \u00b7), the likelihood (or log-score)-based predictive in (2), and this is demonstrated in Loaiza-Maya et al. both theoretically and in extensive numerical illustrations.\nSince a positively-oriented score can, equivalently, be viewed as the negative of a measure of predictive loss, FBP can also be referred to as \u2018loss-based\u2019 prediction. Such terminology is indeed adopted in\nFrazier et al. (2022b), in which the principles delineated here are extended to high-dimensional models, and approximations to both \u03c0w(\u03b8|y1:T ) and pw(yT+1|y1:T ) based on VB proposed, and validated. We note that the term \u2018loss\u2019 as it is used in Loaiza-Maya et al. (2021) and Frazier et al. (2022b) refers specifically to predictive loss as quantified by a proper scoring rule. For the application of loss-based Bayesian inference, in which more general forms of loss functions may drive the Bayesian update, we refer the reader to certain of the other literature cited above, namely Bissiri et al. (2016), Holmes and Walker (2017), Lyddon et al. (2019) and Syring and Martin (2019)."

As such, FBP provides a coherent Bayesian method for estimating weighted combinations of predictives via predictive accuracy criteria, and without the need to assume that the true model is spanned by the set of constituent predictives \u2013 an assumption that underpins BMA, as we have noted.\nA similar motivation underlies other contributions to the extensive Bayesian literature on estimating combinations of predictives that has now developed (and which rivals the large frequentist literature on forecast combinations that has also evolved9), with predictive performance \u2013 quantified by a range of user-specified measures of predictive accuracy \u2013 driving the posterior updating of the weights. Indeed, the Bayesian literature, having access as it does to powerful computational tools, has been able to invoke more complex weighting schemes than can be tackled via frequentist (optimization) methods. Notable contributions, including some also driven by the criterion of predictive calibration (Dawid, 1982; Dawid, 1985; Gneiting et al., 2007), include Billio et al. (2013), Casarin et al. (2015a), Casarin et al. (2015b), Casarin et al. (2016), Pettenuzzo and Ravazzolo (2016), Aastveit et al. (2018), Bassetti et al. (2018), Bas\u0327tu\u0308rk et al. (2019) and Casarin et al. (2023). Once again adopting the language of Bernardo and Smith (1994), this literature seeks to move Bayesian predictive combinations beyond the M-closed world of BMA to the M-open world that accords with the reality of misspecification. We complete this section by also highlighting one particular generalization of BMA that aims, not so much to cater for the M-open world but, rather, to remove the fixed-weight restriction that is inherent to BMA. Certain of the references cited above either explicitly allow for the weights attached to the constituent forecasts to evolve over the time period, t = 1, 2, ...., T , on which the predictive distribution for yT+1 conditions (e.g. Billio et al., 2013, and Casarin et al., 2023) or implicitly allow for such a possibility (e.g. Loaiza-Maya et al., 2021). However, so-called dynamic model averaging (DMA) accommodates time-varying weights via a more direct generalization of BMA, and nests BMA when appropriate settings are activated (see Koop and Korobilis, 2012, page 875 for an illustration of this).\n9See Hall and Mitchell (2007), Ranjan and Gneiting (2010), Geweke and Amisano (2011) and Gneiting and Ranjan (2013) for early contributions to the frequentist forecast combination literature, and Wang et al. (2022) for a recent review. We note that whilst Geweke and Amisano (2011) is not explicitly Bayesian, in terms of estimating the optimal predictive combination, it provides important insights into the connection between the \u2018optimal linear pool\u2019 and BMA, and also uses Bayesian numerical methods in the production of some of the constituent forecast distributions.\nWe refer the reader to Raftery et al.

            "text": "A third approach that seeks to produce Bayesian predictions without relying explicitly on correct model specification is Bayesian predictive synthesis (BPS) (Johnson, 2017; McAlinn and West, 2019; McAlinn et al., 2020; Aastveit et al., 2023), recently expanded to Bayesian predictive decision synthesis (BPDS) by Tallman and West (2022). In particular, BPDS provides a sound decision-theoretic framework for constructing forecast combinations, and can be shown to encompass several commonly-suggested Bayesian forecasting approaches.\nThe starting point of BPDS is the production of a prior distribution over them-dimensional unknown outcome y \u2013 implicitly indexed by T + 1 in a time series forecasting application \u2013 and the information set H, encoded via the J predictive models {hj(y|xj) : 1 \u2264 j \u2264 J}, where x = (x1, . . . ,xJ) denotes the collection of vectors of (possibly latent) dummy variables associated with a decision. The decision maker then constructs a predictive by integrating out x using a \u2018synthesis function\u2019 \u03b1(y|x):\np(y|H) = \u222b\nX\n\u03b1(y|x) J \u220f\nj=1\nhj(y|xj)dx1 . . . dxJ .\nThe choice of the synthesis function \u03b1(\u00b7|x) can be used to drive the analysis. For instance, in the case of forecast combinations, we can take hj(y|x) = pj (y|x,Mj), for some model Mj, and then any set of synthesis functions \u03b1j(\u00b7|x) such that the combination density\np(y|H) = \u222b\nX\n\u2211J j=1 \u03c9j\u03b1j (y,xj | x) pj (y | x,Mj)\n\u2211J k=1 \u03c9k\u03b1k (y,xk | x)\ndx1 . . . dxJ .\nis a valid density, for given weights 0 < \u03c9j < 1, \u2211J j=1 \u03c9j = 1. Specific choices of \u03b1j (y,xj | x) then produce different forecast combination methods (see, Johnson, 2017, for a discussion); for example, in the case of McAlinn and West (2019) and McAlinn et al. (2020), the synthesis function is taken to be the density of a (possibly multivariate) dynamic linear factor model.\nIn an attempt to \u2018focus\u2019 the BPDS approach towards decisions that are tailored to a specific userchosen loss function underlying the analysis or decision at hand, Tallman and West (2022) propose taking as their synthesis function, \u03b1j(y,xj |x) = exp{\u03c4 \u2032(x)Sj(y,xj)}, where the score Sj(y,xj) is a kdimensional vector that measures the utility one receives from realizing outcome y under decision xj, and \u03c4(x) is a vector that weights the directional relevance of Sj(y,xj).\nWhile the BPS framework, as a whole, can set the tenor of the predictions towards dynamic forecast updates that produce predictions tailored to a loss function of interest, via the choice of synthesis function\n10We also refer the reader to Green (1995), Madigan and Raftery, 1995, and George (2000), for alternative approaches to catering for model uncertainty in the Bayesian framework, In brief, such approaches \u2013 in one way or another \u2013 design MCMC samplers to tackle an augmented space in which model uncertainty is incorporated. As a consequence, the computation of any expectation of interest, including that which defines a predictive distribution, automatically factors in all uncertainty associated with both the parameters of each model and the model structure itself. See Green (2003), Marin et al. (2005), Chib (2011) and Fan and Sisson (2011) for reviews and more complete referencing.\n\u03b1(\u00b7|\u00b7), BPS is ultimately tied to a \u2018likelihood-type\u2019 framework, or at least a log-loss function, due to the presence of the latent variables x, which must be integrated out via assumed predictive models, pj (y|x,Mj), and with these individual predictives produced using likelihood-based Bayesian methods. While the BPDS approach can somewhat circumvent the reliance on the likelihood, due to its ability to focus on specific scores, this approach appears to be distinct from methods that entirely replace the likelihood function in the update. Therefore, a very interesting research path would involve combining the methods based on generalized posteriors discussed in Section 3.3.2 with the BPS framework."

            "text": "Central banks and other policy institutions routinely collect vast amounts of time series data on key macroeconomic outcomes. One stylized fact is that these data sets often display substantial co-movements and this calls for modeling all these series jointly to produce accurate point and density forecasts. This, however, leads to large-scale models that are prone to overfitting, ultimately resulting in weak out-ofsample forecasting performance. This helps explain the popularity of Bayesian methods for macroeconomic forecasting. They can easily handle many parameters and, through appropriate prior choice, deal effectively with questions related to model and specification uncertainty in macroeconomic settings.\nAt a high level of generality, there are two modelling approaches used by macroeconomic forecasters. The first uses reduced-form models and imposes relatively little economic structure on the data. The second uses structural models such as dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models that are often estimated through Bayesian techniques; see, among many others, Adolfson et al. (2007), Smets and Wouters (2007) and Del Negro et al. (2016). However, reduced-form approaches have proved more popular and, in this section, our focus will be on them.\nAs stated above, macroeconomists are typically interested in modeling the joint evolution of a set of macroeconomic quantities. To set up a general framework for understanding the types of models used for forecasting, assume that an M -dimensional vector yt is related to a K-dimensional vector of\nexplanatory variables xt through\nyt = g(xt) + \u03b5t, (16)\nwhere g : RK \u2192 RM is a function and \u03b5t is N (0M ,\u03a3t).11 This general specification nests most important reduced-form models commonly used in macroeconomics and can be used to explain the main issues that arise.\nFor instance, if xt = (y \u2032 t\u22121, . . . ,y \u2032 t\u2212p) \u2032 contains p lags of yt, g(xt) = Axt is a linear function with M \u00d7 K(= Mp) coefficient matrix A, and \u03a3t = \u03a3 is constant over time we have a standard vector autoregressive (VAR) model. If we set xt = ft with ft denoting a set of Q \u226a M latent factors and g(ft) = \u039bft is linear with \u039b being an M \u00d7Q matrix of factor loadings and ft evolves according to some stochastic process (such as a VAR), we end up with a dynamic factor model (DFM, see Stock and Watson, 2011). Factor augmented VARs (Bernanke et al., 2005) combine a VAR with a DFM. The dependent variables in the VAR part of the model are a subset of yt plus a small number of factors.\nTraditionally, VARs and factor models have been linear and homoskedastic. But there is a great deal of empirical evidence in most macroeconomic data sets of parameter change, both in the conditional mean and the conditional variance. This can be accommodated through particular choices for g and \u03a3t. For the latter, stochastic volatility processes have proved particularly popular. For the former, various parametric forms for g lead to time-varying parameter VARs (TVP-VARs) which assume that the coefficients of the VAR evolve according to a random walk. But it is also worth noting that there is an increasing literature which assumes g is unknown and uses Bayesian nonparametric methods to uncover its form (see, for example, Kalli and Griffin, 2018, Adrian et al., 2021, and Huber et al., 2023).\nIf we set M = 1 we obtain single-equation time series regressions, which are particularly popular in inflation forecasting (e.g. based on the Phillips curve). If we additionally set xt = 1 and allow for time-varying parameters, we can obtain models such as the unobserved components stochastic volatility (UCSV) model of Stock and Watson (2007) that is commonly used to forecast inflation (for recent applications, see Chan et al., 2013, Stock and Watson, 2016, and Huber and Pfarrhofer, 2021).\nThis general framework defines a class of likelihood functions. As per the outline in Section 2.1, Bayesian forecasting involves multiplying a chosen likelihood function by an appropriate prior to produce a posterior which can be used to produce the predictive density. The choice of prior and computational method used for posterior and predictive inference will be case specific and we will have more to say about some interesting cases below. But a few general comments are worth noting here. First, the choice of prior matters much more in models such as the large VAR, which have a large number of parameters relative to the number observations, than in models with fewer parameters such as the UCSV model or the DFM. Second, for linear homoskedastic models with conjugate priors analytical formulae for the posterior and the one-step-ahead predictive density are available. For all other cases, MCMC methods are available. These take the general form outlined in Section 3.1. However, as noted in Section 3.2, MCMC methods typically do not scale well and can be computationally slow in models involving large numbers of parameters (such as large VARs) or large numbers of latent states (such as TVP-VARs).\n11Note that the Gaussianity assumption is not essential; mixtures of Gaussian distributions, for example, can be used to produce flexible error distributions if deemed necessary (see, for example, Clark et al., 2022a, and Lenza and Primiceri, 2022).\nThus, the focus of many recent papers has been on developing either improved MCMC algorithms or approximate VB methods for speeding up computation. Thirdly, our discussion so far focuses on forecasting with a single model. In practice, it is common to find that forecasts improve if many models are combined. Thus, either BMA or, alternatively, the methods outlined in Section 3.3.3 are commonly used by macroeconomic forecasters.\nWith this general framework established, it is worthwhile to offer some additional detail about some of the most important 21st century developments and a discussion of how they have led to improvements in macroeconomic forecasting.\nLarge VARs Going back to early work such as Doan et al. (1984), Bayesian VARs have been used successfully in a variety of macroeconomic forecasting applications. Recently, they have enjoyed even greater popularity due to the rise of the large VAR. The pioneering large VAR paper was Ban\u0301bura et al. (2010). Subsequently, dozens of papers have used large VARs for macroeconomic forecasting (see, among many others, Carriero et al., 2009, Koop, 2013, Carriero et al., 2015, Giannone et al., 2015, and Hauzenberger et al., 2021). Large VARs, involving dozens or even hundreds of dependent variables, have been found to forecast well and improve upon single-equation techniques and DFMs. Large VARs are heavily over-parameterized and, thus, Bayesian prior shrinkage has been essential in ensuring their forecasting success. We will discuss priors shortly, but at this point we highlight the fact that the use of large Bayesian VARs has been one of the major recent developments in macroeconomic forecasting.\nPrior shrinkage in VARs Many different priors have been used with VARs. Traditionally, natural conjugate priors in the Minnesota tradition were used since these allowed for analytical posteriors and one-step-ahead predictives. Definitions of these priors and discussions of their properties are available in standard sources such as Koop and Korobilis (2010) and Dieppe et al. (2016). These priors are subjective and require the user to select prior hyperparameters, most importantly those relating to the strength of prior shrinkage. In recent years, a range of alternative priors have been proposed which are more automatic, requiring fewer subjective prior choices by the researcher. For instance, Giannone et al. (2015) develop methods for estimating shrinkage parameters in conjugate priors, thus avoiding the need for their subjective elicitation. Chan (2022) also uses a conjugate prior and develops methods for selecting shrinkage parameters using a prior which relaxes some of the restrictive assumptions of the Minnesota prior. There are also a range of methods which automatically decide on the optimal degree of shrinkage for each VAR coefficient. These are the global-local shrinkage priors which are widely used with regressions and in machine learning applications, and increasingly used with VARs.12 Global-local shrinkage priors have the form\naj \u223c N (0, \u03c8j\u03bb), \u03c8j \u223c f1, \u03bb \u223c f2,\nwhere aj is the j th VAR coefficient, \u03bb controls global shrinkage since it is common to all coefficients, and \u03c8j controls local shrinkage since it is specific to the j th coefficient. The densities f1 and f2 are mixing densities and a large range of choices of them have been proposed. One choice leads to stochastic search\n12They are also used with DFMs to select the number of factors.\nvariable selection, used with VARs in George et al. (2008), Koop (2013) and Korobilis (2013), and many other references. Other choices lead to the Dirichlet-Laplace prior used with VARs by Kastner and Huber (2021), or the normal-gamma and horseshoe priors used in Huber and Feldkircher (2019) and Cross et al. (2020); and there are many others. Since these priors are Gaussian at the first layer of the hierarchy, textbook MCMC algorithms for all the VAR parameters can be easily implemented.13\nAdding stochastic volatility (SV) The other main development that has had a tremendous impact on applied macroeconomic forecasting in the 21st century is the development of models such as VARs that incorporate parameter change and nonlinearity. Put simply, the macroeconomic world is rarely linear and homoskedastic, and models that relax these assumptions have been found to improve macroeconomic forecasting. These improvements lie not only in point forecasts, but more importantly in density forecasts. Given the increasing interest, by central banks and academics alike, in issues such as forecast uncertainty and tail risk, the fact that these new models produce more accurate predictive densities increases their value.\nA popular specification for VARs with SV involves factorizing the error variance-covariance ma-\ntrix as \u03a3t = A0HtA \u2032 0 with A0 being a lower triangular matrix with unit diagonals 14 and Ht = diag(eh1t , . . . , ehMt) being a diagonal matrix with log-volatilities evolving according to simple stochastic processes such as independent random walks or AR(1) processes. In an important contribution, Clark (2011) considers a VAR-SV and finds it to produce accurate point and density forecasts relative to homoskedastic models, with gains being particularly pronounced using forecast metrics involving the entire predictive density. Building on this insight, several other researchers have analyzed the role of heteroskedasticity in macroeconomic forecasting in VARs (see, for example, Clark and Ravazzolo, 2015, and Chiu et al., 2017) and confirm the result that using SV pays off when the focus is on obtaining accurate density forecasts. However, a problem with the standard SV specification is that the computational burden relative to homoskedastic VARs is increased enormously. This makes it difficult to do Bayesian forecasting with large VARs with SV. As a remedy, Carriero et al. (2016) propose a simple common stochastic volatility (CSV) specification that assumes the shock variances to be driven by a single common volatility factor, maintaining conjugacy and thus leading to computationally efficient MCMC algorithms. They acknowledge that this model is simplistic but show that it yields much more accurate forecasts than homoskedastic VARs in a standard US macroeconomic forecasting application.\nTo gain more flexibility, researchers have developed algorithms that allow for estimating large VARs with M independent SV processes. Carriero et al. (2019) propose techniques that permit equationby-equation estimation of such VARs and thus render estimation of larger models with SV feasible. Modified versions of this algorithm form the basis of several recent papers that combine large data sets with SV for macroeconomic forecasting (see, among others, Huber and Feldkircher, 2019, Chan, 2021, and Chan et al., 2023).\n13In large VARs with global-local shrinkage priors, MCMC methods can nevertheless be very slow, with much faster VB methods developed in Gefang et al. (2022).\n14A0 can also be time varying.\nAdding time variation in the VAR coefficients The previous discussion has emphasized that capturing changing error variances is key for obtaining precise forecasts. However, it may also be important to allow for structural change in the VAR coefficients themselves. One popular multivariate model that captures both changes in the VAR coefficients and error variances is the TVP-VAR-SV model proposed in Primiceri (2005), which assumes that the VAR coefficients \u03b2t = vec(At) are time-varying and evolve according to a multivariate random walk while \u03a3t is a multivariate SV process. This model is a multivariate state space model which can be estimated using adaptations of the techniques outlined in Section 3.1.3. The innovations to the states govern the amount of time variation in the parameters. Various shrinkage priors (often based on the global-local shrinkage priors discussed above) have been proposed that allow for a data-based decision as to whether time variation in a corresponding coefficient is necessary or not. These priors are typically elicited on the non-centered parameterization of the state space model (see Fru\u0308hwirth-Schnatter and Wagner, 2010) and can help minimize overfitting concerns and produce improved forecasts.\nD\u2019Agostino et al. (2013) is an important early contribution to the macroeconomic forecasting literature using TVP models. This paper uses a small TVP-VAR with SV and shows that it produces more accurate point predictions, outperforming simpler univariate benchmarks and constant parameter VARs. One key shortcoming of this model, however, is that it only uses a small information set. This has led to several researchers proposing new methods that can be used in higher dimensions. Various approaches are possible, including models that restrict the TVP process (e.g. by imposing a factor structure, which allows for time variation in a large number of parameters to be driven by a low number of factors, see Chan et al., 2020). As mentioned above, shrinkage priors are used to keep the curse of dimensionality in check. These priors are typically used after transforming the model to allow for equation-by-equation estimation. Such approaches mean fairly high-dimensional TVP-VARs can be estimated without risk of over-fitting, and in a reasonable amount of time. MCMC-based forecasting with large TVP-VARs and regressions is also an active field of research and different shrinkage methods and advances in computation have led to improvements in the forecasting performance of TVP models (see, among many others, Hauzenberger et al., 2022, and Huber et al., 2021). However, it is worth noting that if computation does become a concern, approximate methods (e.g. using the VB methods outlined in Section 3.2.3) can be used. Approaches which avoid the need for MCMC are developed in Koop and Korobilis (2013) and Koop and Korobilis (2023). In the former paper the authors propose large approximate TVP-VARs based on forgetting factors, whereas in the latter they use VB techniques to forecast inflation with large TVP regression models.\nBayesian nonparametric VARs Up to this point we have assumed that the conditional mean function g takes a known form. However, it could be that the functional form is unknown. Bayesian nonparametric techniques, such as Bayesian additive regression trees (BART, see Chipman et al., 2010), Gaussian processes and kernel regressions (Adrian et al., 2021) or infinite mixtures (Kalli and Griffin, 2018), allow the researcher to uncover such unknown functional forms and produce precise macroeconomic forecasts. In general, they have had great success, but they have been found to be particularly useful in studies that focus on the tails of predictive distributions or on the handling of outliers such as\nthe ones experienced during the pandemic (see, for example, Huber et al., 2023, and Clark et al., 2022b).\nKalli and Griffin (2018) propose a nonparametric VAR that builds on an infinite mixture model with the mixture weights being driven by the lagged endogenous variables. They show, using US and UK data, that their model yields competitive forecasts, with accuracy gains in terms of point and density predictions increasing sharply for higher forecast horizons. Clark et al. (2022a) use BART-based VARs to perform tail forecasting of US output, unemployment and inflation in real time, finding that nonparametric techniques work well in the tails and for higher-order forecasts. With a particular focus on predictive accuracy during the pandemic, Huber et al. (2023) develop mixed frequency nonparametric VARs and show that these models yield substantially more precise nowcasts during the Covid-19 period.\nConclusions and further directions We have outlined how Bayesian methods have been used successfully for macroeconomic forecasting. Most of the discussion has related to VARs, which are a class of models where Bayesian methods have proved particularly popular. But it is worth noting that empirically-relevant extensions (e.g. SV or TVP) can be added to other multivariate time series models such as DFMs or FAVARs, as can the VAR prior shrinkage methods (e.g. global-local shrinkage methods) we have discussed. It is also worth noting that we have focused on models that do not restrict the coefficients. However, restricted VARs are often used for forecasting. For instance, vector error correction models (which impose cointegrating restrictions) or multi-country VARs such as global VARs are restricted VARs.\nWe have also focused on forecasting as opposed to the closely related field of nowcasting. Mixed frequency VARs, which jointly model quickly-released, high-frequency variables (e.g. monthly variables such as surveys, employment and inflation) and slowly-released, low-frequency variables (e.g. quarterly variables such as GDP), have proved very popular with nowcasters. Bayesian methods are typically used with such models (see, for example, Schorfheide and Song, 2015, Huber et al., 2023, Koop et al., 2020, and McCracken et al., 2021) and, in real-time nowcasting exercises they tend to perform well."

            "text": "A pertinent question in financial analysis is whether the risks associated with financial assets \u2013 and the prices of those risks \u2013 are predictable in ways that are useful in applications such as portfolio allocation, risk management and derivative pricing. With risk factors typically being represented as latent distributional features of observable financial variables, it follows that two key goals in the statistical analysis of financial problems are: i) The accurate prediction of latent distributional features; and ii) The development of complex, non-linear state space models to underpin this prediction.\nBoth of these goals lend themselves naturally to a Bayesian treatment given, in turn, the automatic production of predictive distributions via the Bayesian paradigm, and the swathe of computational methods available to estimate complex models \u2013 most notably those with a latent variable structure. In particular, the growth in financial derivatives markets from the 1990s onwards has generated the need to model the underlying asset as a continuous time process, almost always augmented with a continuous time process for the asset volatility, and often via a jump diffusion. Such models \u2013 whilst \u2018convenient\u2019 in the sense of allowing for closed-form solutions for derivative prices \u2013 are challenging from a statistical\npoint of view, given that they typically need to be treated as a (discretized) non-linear state-space model, and may require multiple sources of data to enable separate identification of model parameters and risk premia. Estimation of and forecasting with such models is nevertheless computationally feasible via Bayesian methods, with MCMC algorithms of one form or another forming the backbone of the early treatments (Eraker, 2001; Eraker et al., 2003; Eraker, 2004; Forbes et al., 2007; Johannes et al., 2009).\nWe refer the reader to Jacquier and Polson (2011) and Johannes and Polson (2010) for comprehensive reviews of the application of Bayesian methods in finance up to the first decade of the 21st century. The coverage includes, in short, Bayesian approaches to: portfolio allocation, return predictability, asset pricing, volatility, covariance, \u2018beta\u2019 and \u2018value at risk\u2019 prediction, continuous time models (and discretized versions thereof), interest rate modelling, and derivative (e.g. option) pricing. Our goal in the current review is to outline the more recent advances that have evolved over the last decade, in particular those that have exploited (in one way or another) new methodological advances, new sources of data, and modern computational techniques. In order, we shall briefly review: the use of diverse data sets, including derivative prices and high-frequency measures of financial quantities; the treatment of DGPs that are unavailable in closed form; the analysis of high-dimensional models; and the application of non-parametric modelling.\nMultiple sources of financial data It is now a well-established fact that the constant volatility feature of a geometric diffusion process for a financial asset price is inconsistent with both the observed dynamics in return volatility and the excess kurtosis and skewness that characterizes the typical empirical return distribution; see Bollerslev et al. (1992) for an early review. The option pricing literature supports this finding, with certain empirical regularities, such as \u2018implied volatility smiles\u2019, seen as evidence that asset prices deviate from the geometric Brownian motion assumption that underlies the Black and Scholes (1973) option price (Bakshi et al., 1997; Hafner and Herwartz, 2001; Lim et al., 2005). Hence, the 21st century has seen the proliferation of many alternative specifications for asset prices, and associated theoretical derivative prices, most of which are nested in a general framework of (discretized) bivariate jump diffusion models for the asset itself and its volatility. Allied with these developments has been the growth in access to transaction-level \u2018high-frequency\u2019 data \u2013 in both the spot and options markets \u2013 which, in itself, has spawned new approaches to inference and forecasting in the financial sphere.\nThe Bayesian literature has brought to bear on this problem the power of computational methods \u2013 both established, and more recent \u2013 to enable the multivariate state space models that have emerged from this literature to be estimated, and probabilistic predictions of all dynamic variables \u2013 the return itself, volatility, random jumps (in either the return or the volatility, or both), and various risk premia \u2013 to be produced. With reference to the generic notation for a state space model in (7) and (8), Bayesian approaches over the last decade can be categorized according to the specification adopted for the (multivariate) measurement at time t, yt and, hence, for the (multivariate) state, zt, being modelled and forecast. Some work exploits data from both the spot and options market to predict volatility and its risk premia (Maneesoonthorn et al., 2012), and option prices (Yu et al., 2011; Carverhill and Luo,\n202315); other work combines \u2018low-frequency\u2019 daily observations on returns with high-frequency measures of volatility and/or price jumps to predict (in some combination) returns, volatility, and the size and occurrence of price jumps (Jin and Maheu, 2013; Maneesoonthorn et al., 2017; Frazier et al., 2019); whilst further work combines daily returns with futures prices in predicting various financial quantities of interest (Fileccia and Sgarra, 2018; Gonzato and Sgarra, 2021).\nFinancial models that are \u2018unavailable\u2019 All but one of the papers cited in the previous paragraphs share a common feature - namely, a DGP that can be expressed as a probability density (or mass) function. With reference to (9), it is the availability of a closed form for p(y1:T , z1:T |\u03b8) = p(y1:T |z1:T ,\u03b8)p(z1:T |\u03b8), that renders feasible the MCMC methods used in the said works. In contrast, Frazier et al. (2019) adopt a process for the latent log-volatility that is driven by an \u03b1-stable innovation, such that p(z1:T |\u03b8) is unavailable, and MCMC infeasible as a consequence. Instead, ABC is adopted for inference, and an approximate predictive of the form of (12) produced instead. In addition to providing theoretical validation of the approach, the authors demonstrate, in range of different simulation settings, that despite inaccuracy at the posterior level, the approximate predictive is always a very close match to the exact predictive. Related work in which an ABC method is used to conduct forecasting appears in Canale and Ruggiero (2016), Kon Kam King et al. (2019), Virbickaite\u0307 et al. (2020) and Pesonen et al. (2022). ABC treatment of a conditional likelihood for a time series of financial returns, p(y1:T |z1:T ,\u03b8), that is unavailable in closed form is also investigated in Creel and Kristensen (2015), Martin et al. (2019) and Chakraborty et al. (2022), with Chakraborty et al. (2022) proposing a modularized version of ABC. For other recent Bayesian treatments of intractable models of this sort that continue to exploit MCMC principles (with or without an ABC component), see Vankov et al. (2019) and Mu\u0308ller and Uhl (2021).16\nLarge financial models Thus far, we have reviewed Bayesian treatments of models for single financial assets. That is, the models may have specified multiple latent components, and potentially multiple measurements, but they still aim to explain (and forecast) quantities related to a single asset. Models for multiple assets are also critically important in financial applications, with the relationship between financial assets determining the extent to which diversification can be achieved, as well as how risks permeate the various sectors of the financial market. Indeed, Bayesian methods are particularly suitable for dealing with such multivariate models, since the dimensionality of z1:T is typically much larger than that of y1:T and, hence, challenging to deal with via any other means.\nChib et al. (2009) provide an early review of the Bayesian analysis of multivariate SV models, with all work up to this point utilizing traditional MCMC techniques, and the statistical and predictive analysis limited to relatively low-dimensional systems (up to ten assets). Subsequent work has focused on the development of more flexible multivariate distributions (Nakajima, 2017), and the use of sparse factor structures and shrinkage priors in constructing larger-dimensional models (Zhou et al., 2014; Kastner et al.,\n15We note that whilst a time series model is constructed in the case of these two references, the (out-of-sample) prediction of option prices is across the cross section of strike prices and maturities. We also make note of Fulop and Li (2019) who exploit spot and options data to produce filtered estimates (as opposed to strictly out-of-sample predictions) of latent volatility and price jump intensity.\n16The citation of Creel and Kristensen (2015), Martin et al. (2019), Vankov et al. (2019) and Mu\u0308ller and Uhl (2021) is relevant to this review, despite these references not having an explicit component on forecasting.\n2017; Bas\u0327tu\u0308rk et al., 2019). More recently, with the advances made in VB methods, inference and prediction in very large-dimensional financial models is now possible (Gunawan et al., 2021; Chan and Yu, 2022; Frazier et al., 2022a; Quiroz et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023). There is also a growing interest in the prediction of co-movements of various sorts, with: Bernardi et al. (2015) predicting the interdependence between U.S. stocks with Bayesian time-varying quantile regressions; Geraci and Gnabo (2018) capturing and predicting the interconnectedness of financial institutions through Bayesian time-varying VARs; and Alexopoulos et al. (2022) modelling and predicting common jump factors in a large panel of financial returns.\nBayesian nonparametric modelling in finance As noted, simple parametric assumptions such as additive Gaussian innovations are inconsistent with the stylized features of financial data. Whilst more suitable non-Gaussian/non-linear models can be built (as highlighted above), Bayesian nonparametric modelling allows for further flexibility via the incorporation of Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) structures. Such an approach has been shown to provide robustness to distributional assumptions and can improve point forecasts, but the main gain has been significant improvements in the accuracy of predictive densities, and of risk measures derived from those densities. The advancement of the literature in this direction has been aided by the stick-breaking representation (Sethuraman, 1994) and the introduction of the slice sampler (Walker, 2007; Kalli et al., 2011).\nJensen and Maheu (2010) introduce an extension to a standard SV model to capture the unknown return innovation distribution via a DPM. The DPM specification has also been inserted into other popular models in finance, with: Jensen and Maheu (2014) adopting a DPM to jointly model the return and future log-volatility distribution; Delatola and Griffin (2013) capturing the so-called leverage effect; Aus\u0301\u0131n et al. (2014) applying a DPM to univariate GARCH models; and Kalli and Griffin (2015) using Bayesian nonparametric modelling to aggregate autoregressive processes to produce an SV model with long-range dependence. Extensions to multivariate financial models have also occurred: in a multivariate GARCH setting in Jensen and Maheu (2013); and in a Cholesky-type multivariate SV model in Zaharieva et al. (2020).\nA potential drawback of the DPM model is that it neglects time dependence in the unknown distribution. An important extension of the DPM prior is the hierarchical Dirichlet process of Teh et al. (2006), which allows for the construction of a prior for an infinite hidden Markov model (IHMM), which allows for time dependence in a flexible manner. The introduction of the beam sampler of Van Gael et al. (2008), which extends the slice sampler, renders conventional posterior sampling methods for finite-state Markov switching models (Chib, 1996) feasible in the IHMM. The IHMM structure has been used to model the univariate GARCH distribution (Dufays, 2016), and the multivariate GARCH distribution (Li, 2022); and to provide a nonparametric model for realized measures, including realized covariance matrices (Jin and Maheu, 2016; Liu and Maheu, 2018; Jin et al., 2019), with all papers documenting very large improvements in density forecast accuracy from the IHMM. Other applications of the IHMM include: Shi and Song (2016), who use the IHMM to date and forecast speculative bubbles, and who also adopt a version with GARCH effects; Yang (2019), who studies the relationship between stock returns and real growth with a multivariate IHMM model; and, more recently, Jin et al. (2022), who employ the\nDPM prior in the infinite Markov pooling of predictive distributions, with forecasting applications to interest rates, realized covariances and asset returns. Other approaches to time dependence in Bayesian nonparametrics for finance include Griffin and Steel (2011), who introduce a time-dependent stick breaking process in a general setting and develop an SV model for returns. More recently, Sun et al. (2020) use a weighted DPM to forecast return distributions, while Zamenjani (2021) allows for lagged covariates to impact the weights in the DPM model through a probit stick-breaking process."

            "text": "Bayesian methods are applied to a wide range of marketing problems; see Rossi and Allenby (2003) for a review of the early literature. More recently, these methods have been increasingly used for the purpose of prediction, for instance in customer choice behaviour (Toubia et al., 2019; Araya et al., 2022), customer demand (Posch et al., 2022), customer satisfaction (Mittal et al., 2021), dynamic pricing (Bastani et al., 2022), advertising effectiveness (Danaher et al., 2020; Loaiza-Maya et al., 2022) and recommender systems (Ansari et al., 2018). Given the large variety of marketing applications, we focus in this section on the modelling of customer choice to illustrate the key principles of Bayesian prediction in marketing problems.\nA common problem in marketing is that of setting the price level of a set of products so that total profits are maximized. To estimate these optimal prices, predictions of how customers will react to price changes are crucial. Predictions of customer choices under different marketing environments can be constructed by choice models. These models are estimated using data about the product choices of customers in the marketplace, a survey, an experiment, etc. (Rossi et al., 2012).\nAn example of a prediction of interest in this context is the predicted purchase probability of a customer for a particular product as a function of its own price or the price of another product. The predicted purchase probability can be constructed for a customer for which only a few choices are observed, or for a new customer for which we do not observe choices in the data.17\nThe two most popular models used to predict choice behaviour are the multinomial logit and multinomial probit models. The multinomial logit model imposes the independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) property (McFadden, 1989), which means that it cannot capture general substitution patterns among choice alternatives. The IIA property of this model can be relaxed under certain assumptions by extending the multinomial logit model to a nested logit model (Poirier, 1996; Lahiri and Gao, 2002) or a random parameter logit model (Train, 2009).\nOn the other hand, the multinomial probit model does not impose the IIA property, and as such is commonly used in the analysis of economic choice behaviour, where complementary and substitution effects are important. For instance, the multinomial probit model has been recently used in the analysis of car choices (Karmakar et al., 2021), grocery brand choices (Miyazaki et al., 2021), employment choices (Mishkin, 2021), and car parking choices (Paleti, 2018). The remainder of this section presents a review of Bayesian prediction based on the multinomial probit model.\n17Although this section, as noted in the Introduction, focuses on prediction using cross-sectional data, choice models can also be applied to the forecasting of future choice probabilities by using time series data (McCormick et al., 2012) or panel data (Gilbride and Allenby, 2004; Terui et al., 2011).\nMultinomial probit model specification The variable of interest is yi \u2208 {0, 1, 2, . . . , J}, which indicates the choice made by individual i among a set of J + 1 alternatives. This choice is modeled to be conditional on a set of J latent utilities zi = (zi1, . . . , ziJ ) \u2032, so that the conditional pmf is defined as\np(yi|zi) = { I [ziyi = max(zi)] if max(zi) > 0,\nI[yi = 0] if max(zi) \u2264 0, (17)\nwhere p(yi|zi) = Pr(Yi = yi|zi), ziyi is the yi-th element of zi, with yi > 0, and I[A] is one if statement A is true and zero otherwise. The base category j = 0 is one of the choice alternatives, which is selected a priori. The base category is observed whenever all the latent utilities are less than zero.\nThe utilities are expressed in terms of r predictors via a linear Gaussian model,\np(zi|Xi,\u03b8) = \u03c6J (zi;Xi\u03b2,\u03a3) , (18)\nwhere \u03c6J (z;\u00b5, C) denotes a J-variate normal density with mean \u00b5 and covariance matrix C, Xi a J \u00d7 r matrix of predictor values, \u03b2 an r-dimensional vector of coefficients, and \u03a3 a covariance matrix that captures complementary and substitution effects between the choice alternatives.\nCombined, (17) and (18) give rise to the augmented likelihood function of the multinomial probit\nmodel\np(y, z|\u03b8,X) = n \u220f\ni=1\np(yi|zi)p(zi|Xi,\u03b8), (19)\nwhere \u03b8 = {\u03b2,\u03a3}, y = {yi}ni=1, z = {zi}ni=1, and X = {Xi}ni=1, with n the total number of individuals. For a given prior distribution p(\u03b8), the augmented posterior distribution of the model is given as\np(\u03b8, z|y,X) \u221d p(y, z|\u03b8,X)p(\u03b8). (20)\nAlbert and Chib (1993) were the first to propose the use of data augmentation (see Section 3.1.3 herein) for conducting Bayesian analysis of the multinomial probit model.\nThe predictive distribution Consider now an individual s, with predictor values Xs, whose choice behaviour we would like to predict. The predictive for individual s, can be written as\np(ys|Xs,y,X) = \u222b\n\u0398\n\u222b\nzs\np(ys|zs)p(zs|\u03b8,Xs)dzs \u222b\nz\np(\u03b8,z|y,X)dz d\u03b8, (21)\nfrom which the predictive choice probabilities Pr(Ys = j|Xs,y,X) = p(j|Xs,y,X) can be constructed. The specification and computation of the predictive distribution in (21) poses three key challenges.\nFirst, p(ys|zs) requires a choice of base category. This choice affects the prior predictive choice probabilities, and hence the (posterior) predictive choice probabilities can be sensitive to the choice of base category; see Burgette and Nordheim (2012). Burgette et al. (2021) propose a symmetric prior specification to address this problem. The parameters \u03b8 are not identified under this prior, but this does not affect the predicted probabilities.\nSecond, the parameters \u03b8 lack scale identification, as p(yi|zi) = p(yi|czi) for any positive scalar c. Different solutions have been proposed to fix the scale, all based on a constraint on the specification of \u03a3. For instance, McCulloch et al. (2000) fix the first leading element of \u03a3 to unity. This approach is\nsensitive to the ordering of the choice categories in the model. Burgette and Nordheim (2012) fix the trace of \u03a3, which is invariant to the way in which the choice categories enter the model.\nThird, the computation of p(ys|Xs,y,X) involves the evaluation of the integrals over the latent utilities in zs and z. Since no analytical solution for these integrals is available, they are solved with MCMC sampling steps. The latent utility of each choice category is sampled from a univariate truncated normal, conditional on the latent utilities for all the other choice alternatives, for each individual (McCulloch and Rossi, 1994). Conditional on the draws for the latent utilities, sampling \u03b2 from its full conditional is straightforward. Generating from the conditional distribution of \u03a3 is nonstandard as the scale restrictions on \u03a3 have to be taken into account.\nScalable Bayesian prediction In addition to the challenges delineated above, it is difficult to scale p(ys|Xs,y,X) to problems with large choice sets or a large number of observations. Recent advances in the computation of the predictive have focused on tackling the scalability issues in J and n, as we discuss below.\nWhen considering a full covariance matrix specification for \u03a3, the total number of parameters increases quadratically with J . For problems with large choice sets and small samples, this implies that the ratio of total number of parameters to total number of observations is large, making it difficult to construct accurate predictions. Loaiza-Maya and Nibbering (2022b) propose a spherical transformation of the covariance matrix of the latent utilities that imposes a parsimonious factor structure and a trace restriction. As a result, the total number of parameters grows only linearly with J . The authors demonstrate that this parsimonious structure leads to improved predictive performance over full covariance matrix specifications.\nAdditionally, as noted above, the construction of the predictive entails evaluation of the integral over the latent utilities z. Although MCMC is able to solve this integral, it does so by generating the utility vector for each individual from a multivariate truncated normal, which is a computationally costly exercise (McCulloch and Rossi, 1994; Botev, 2017). This renders MCMC algorithms impractical for problems where a large n is considered.\nVB can be employed to tackle problems with large n. Adapting the generic descriptions of VB in Section 3.2.3 and Appendix A.7, the application of VB in this setting considers the class of approximating densities Q with elements q\u03bb(\u03b8, z) \u2208 Q, indexed by a variational parameter vector \u03bb. The exact augmented posterior is approximated by q\n\u03bb\u0302 (\u03b8, z) with an optimal variational parameter vector equal to\n\u03bb\u0302 = argmin \u03bb\u2208\u039b\nKL [q\u03bb(\u03b8, z)|p(\u03b8, z|y,X)] , (22)\nwhere KL denotes the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The variational predictive is then constructed as\np\u0302\u03bb(ys|Xs,y,X) = \u222b\n\u0398\n\u222b\nzs\np(ys|zs)p(zs|\u03b8,Xs)dzs \u222b\nz\nq \u03bb\u0302 (\u03b8, z)dz d\u03b8.\nCalibration of the variational approximation requires a scale-identified expression for p(y, z|\u03b8,X). To achieve this, Girolami and Rogers (2006) consider an identity matrix covariance structure, while Fasano and Durante (2022) fix \u03a3 at predetermined values. Loaiza-Maya and Nibbering (2022a) propose a method for a multinomial probit model with a factor covariance structure. This method uses the hybrid variational approximation q\u03bb(\u03b8, z) = q\u03bb(\u03b8)p(z|y,\u03b8,X) introduced by Loaiza-Maya et al. (2022)."

            "text": "Forecasting in electricity markets is critical for efficient day-to-day operation of power grids, long-term planning of infrastructure and increasingly, at a disaggregated level, for the management of smart grids. This section will cover forecasting electricity prices, electricity load/demand and generation by source of power, primarily wind and solar. Hereafter these problems will collectively be referred to as \u2018electricity forecasting\u2019. Motivations for electricity forecasting can be found in general reviews such as Weron (2014) for price forecasting, Lindberg et al. (2019) for load forecasting, Antonanzas et al. (2016) for solar power forecasting and Giebel and Kariniotakis (2017) for wind power forecasting. These reviews indicate that the majority of work in electricity forecasting does not employ a Bayesian approach; however notwithstanding this, Bayesian methods have found success in the field.\nThere are very few instances of Bayesian forecasting in electricity markets that predate the early 2000s, although we now cover some notable exceptions. Bunn (1980) consider the case of updating load forecasts in an online fashion by computing a Bayesian model average of load profiles of a cloudy and a sunny day. Meanwhile, Bayesian VARs have been used by Gunel (1987), Beck and Solow (1994) and Joutz et al. (1995) to forecast energy demand, nuclear power generation and demand prices and consumption respectively. A Bayesian VAR shrinks autoregressive coefficients to either a random walk or white noise depending on whether data are stationary or non-stationary and was popularized in macroeconomics by Doan et al. (1984) (see also Section 4.1). The performance of Bayesian VARs in early electricity forecasting applications is mixed; Beck and Solow (1994) find evidence in favour of Bayesian autoregression, Joutz et al. (1995) find that Bayesian VARs are effective for forecasting demand, but not price, while Gunel (1987) does not find any improvement at all from using Bayesian VARs rather than conventional autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models.\nWith the advent and popularization of MCMC methods, Bayesian forecasting has begun to find greater success in the field of electricity forecasting. In the literature of roughly the past two decades, there are three common major motivations for using Bayesian forecasting, two of which have antecedents in the earlier literature. The first is the use of \u2018Bayesian models\u201918, which have now grown well beyond Bayesian VARs to include models with latent volatilities, models with a spatial dimension, and Bayesian neural networks. The second is the use of BMA for forecast combination. The third is the production of full probabilistic forecasts via Bayesian computation. These are now each discussed in turn.\nBayesian models The structure inherent in many electricity forecasting problems provides a motivation for the innovative use of priors to improve forecasting accuracy. Although the early literature cited before found somewhat ambiguous results when comparing Bayesian VARs to classical alternatives, more recent work finds evidence in favour of a Bayesian approach; see Raviv et al. (2015) for point forecasts and Gianfreda et al. (2020) for both point and density forecasts. An important aspect of this work is the exploitation of the intraday nature of the data, since typically hourly prices are stacked in a VAR model. The intraday structure lends itself to priors that shrink parameters corresponding to consecutive\n18By a \u2018Bayesian model\u2019 we generally mean a model with a prior and likelihood estimated by Bayesian inference. Bayesian methods for finding tuning parameters such as the automatic relevance determination (see Hippert and Taylor, 2010, for an example in electricity forecasting), and Bayesian optimisation lie beyond the scope of this section.\nhours of the day that are close to one another. An early application of this approach can be seen in Cottet and Smith (2003).\nSince electricity data are increasingly available not only at a high temporal frequency but also at a high spatial resolution, there are further examples in the literature of using priors to exploit neighbourhood structure. Examples include Ohtsuka et al. (2010) who use spatial ARMA processes to predict electricity load in nine Japanese regions, and Gilanifar et al. (2019) who use spatio-temporal Gaussian processes to forecast residential-level electricity demand. Even where spatial information is unavailable, hierarchical models estimated using Bayesian methods have been used to produce disaggregate energy demand forecasts; examples can be found in Mori and Nakano (2014) and Wang et al. (2017) who use Gaussian processes, and Grillone et al. (2021) who use regression. Informative hierarchical priors have been used in instances where data sets are small in size, or unavailable; for example, Pezzulli et al. (2006) elicit priors for future trajectories of temperature in the winter using past observations, and Launay et al. (2015) elicit priors for the electricity demand of \u2018non-metered\u2019 households using data on \u2018metered\u2019 households.\nWhile the aforementioned examples take a Bayesian approach to exploit the use of priors in novel ways, another strain of the Bayesian forecasting literature is based on estimating models with latent variables. Examples in electricity forecasting include a latent jump process for price spikes (Chan et al., 2014) and SV models (Smith, 2010; Kostrzewski and Kostrzewska, 2019). Also, in recent years, Bayesian analysis of machine learning models has become increasingly popular. This includes neural network models (Brusaferri et al., 2019; Ghayekhloo et al., 2019; Capone et al., 2020), where VB is typically used. Also, Bayesian regression trees (see Section 4.1) have been applied to electricity forecasting by Nateghi et al. (2011) and Alipour et al. (2019), who find that they outperform non-Bayesian counterparts. Finally, there is an extensive literature on using Bayesian networks for forecasting in energy; see Adedipe et al. (2020) for a review of these methods in forecasting wind generation.\nBayesian model averaging (BMA) As noted earlier, the importance of forecast combination is widely appreciated in the forecasting literature. Whilst, as highlighted in Section 3.3.3, many different Bayesian approaches to forecast combination have now been explored, BMA remains a very important method in the sphere of electricity forecasting. As described in Section 2.1, BMA uses posterior model probabilities as combination weights. Whenever the choice of model is parameterized, the predictive density has an interpretation as a forecast combination. Examples include Smith (2000) who combines forecasts from regression models that include different predictor sets, and Panagiotelis and Smith (2008) who average over models with different combinations of skew and symmetric marginal distributions.\nIt is also common in the electricity forecasting literature to produce point forecasts from different models and then combine these using BMA as a post-processing step. This approach grew out of research combining ensembles of forecasts from numerical weather predictions (NWPs) (Raftery et al., 2005; Sloughter et al., 2010). In the NWP setting, forecasts are the outputs of deterministic physical models. Statistical models are then formed by assuming that for k = 1, . . . ,K, p(yt|ak, bk, fk, \u03c32,Mk) \u223c N(ak+bkfk, \u03c3 2), where fk is the k th NWP and ak, bk and \u03c3 2 are additional parameters. These statistical models are then combined using the usual BMA machinery described by (3), with the key distinction\nbeing that posterior model probabilities are replaced with p(Mk|yT\u2212L+1:T ), where L is the length of the window. Uncertainty over ak, bk and \u03c3 2 is integrated out in the usual way, and there are no additional parameters since the fk are obtained deterministically. This approach has been used in energy forecasting by Coelho et al. (2006), who motivate forecasting rainfall as a input into forecasting generation from hydroelectric dams, and Du (2018) who uses wind forecasts to predict generation from wind farms.\nThe work of Raftery et al. (2005) has been subsequently extended to the case where the forecasts fk are not the outputs of deterministic physical models but are point forecasts from statistical models, each with their own unknown parameters. For example Nowotarski et al. (2014) adopt the approach of Raftery et al. (2005) but where the fk are obtained from statistical time series models with parameters estimated using frequentist techniques. This approach is not fully Bayesian (despite being referred to as BMA in the literature), since although the model average integrates over the uncertainty in ak, bk and \u03c32 it does not integrate over uncertainty in the parameters of the underlying time series models used to generate the point forecasts fk. 19 In a similar vein, Hassan et al. (2015) and Raza et al. (2017) combine electricity load forecasts from different neural networks.\nProbabilistic forecasting A common motivation for taking a Bayesian approach is the ease with which the computational machinery of MCMC or approximate methods produces a full predictive density rather than only point forecasts. Key operational decisions in electricity forecasting depend on quantities other than the predicted mean; see Nowotarski and Weron (2018) and references therein for discussion. While the importance of probabilistic forecasting is often highlighted in Bayesian papers it is not always the case that forecasts are evaluated in a way that assesses the quality of the full predictive distribution20. For example, often probabilistic forecasts are summarized by prediction intervals, and the empirical coverage of these intervals used as a means of checking model quality; for an early example see Pezzulli et al. (2006), and more recently Wang et al. (2017) and Kostrzewski and Kostrzewska (2019), where the latter show that Bayesian methods compare favourably to non-Bayesian alternatives for forecasting electricity prices. Kostrzewski and Kostrzewska (2019) also evaluate \u03b1-level quantile forecasts q\u0302t using the pinball loss,\nL\u03b1(yt, q\u0302t) = \u03b1(yt \u2212 q\u0302t)I[yt \u2265 q\u0302t] + (1\u2212 \u03b1)(q\u0302t \u2212 yt)I[yt < q\u0302t] .\nYang et al. (2019) and Sun et al. (2019) also use pinball loss to evaluate forecasts of residential-level load (net of solar PV generation in the latter case).\nHowever, the use of scoring rules (Gneiting and Raftery, 2007) and, hence, the explicit recognition of the distributional form of the forecasts, is becoming increasingly popular as a means of evaluating predictive distributions in both Bayesian and non-Bayesian electricity forecasting. The continuously ranked probability score (Gneiting and Raftery, 2007) is particularly amenable to Bayesian inference since it is usually approximated using a Monte Carlo sample from the predictive density. For an early example of its use in Bayesian electricity forecasting see Panagiotelis and Smith (2008); for later examples, see Bracale and De Falco (2015), Brusaferri et al. (2019) and Gianfreda et al. (2020). Other scoring rules\n19The same point does not apply when combining ensembles from NWPs since the forecasting models are deterministic. 20We note that in some cases this is challenging; for example for long-run forecasts as in Da Silva et al. (2019).\nare less commonly used in the Bayesian electricity forecasting literature, although Ohtsuka et al. (2010), where the log score is used, is a notable exception."

And as models have become larger and more challenging, and as data sets have grown \u2018bigger\u2019, this problem of accessing the exact posterior has only increased. However, as this review has demonstrated, the expansion of the forecasting problems being tackled has gone hand-in-hand with the development of new and improved computational methods designed expressly to access challenging posteriors, and in a reasonable computing time. Notably, when it comes to accurate forecasting, somewhat crude approximations of the posterior have been found to still yield accurate predictions; meaning that Bayesian forecasting remains viable for large and complex models for which approximate computation of posteriors is the only feasible approach.\nThe more fundamental problem of model misspecification can also be managed, by moving away from the conventional likelihood-based Bayesian updating and allowing forecast accuracy itself \u2013 and its link to the future decisions that depend on that accuracy \u2013 to drive the updating. This, in turn, ensures that forecasts are \u2018fit for purpose\u2019, despite the inevitable misspecification of the forecasting model. Allied with the computational power that now drives the Bayesian engine, this ability to generalize the paradigm beyond its traditional links with the likelihood principle is a potent, if not yet fully realized, force in forecasting."

Decisions about the blocking of z1:T are particularly important, given both the dimension of z1:T and the time-series dependence in the state process, as are matters of parameterizing the state space model. We refer the reader to: Shephard and Pitt (1997) and Strickland et al. (2006) for illustrations of state blocking in which the block sizes are selected randomly; and to Fru\u0308hwirth-Schnatter (2004) and Strickland et al. (2008) for explorations of the impact of parameterization on the performance of the sampler.\nA.4 PMMH in state space models\nEarly Bayesian treatments of non-linear state space models often exploited a linear Gaussian approximation at some point, for the purpose of defining candidate densities for (blocks of) z1:T (e.g., Kim et al., 1998; Stroud et al., 2003; Strickland et al., 2006), thereby enabling a Kalman filter-based \u2018forward filtering, backward sampling\u2019 algorithm (Carter and Kohn, 1994; Fru\u0308hwirth-Schnatter, 1994) to be used to produce a candidate draw of (any particular block of) z1:T , conditional on \u03b8. As noted in Section 3.2.2 (and in the review, Giordani et al., 2011), more recent approaches to such models have exploited PMMH principles instead. Algorithm 3 reproduces the algorithm in Andrieu et al. (2011) (Section 2.4.2\ntherein), adapted slightly to match the notation of the current paper. To simplify the exposition, the algorithm is presented for sampling the full vector \u03b8.

Typically this proceeds by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between q(\u03b8) and p(\u03b8|y1:T ), which produces the variational approximation as\nq\u2217(\u03b8) := argmin q(\u03b8)\u2208Q KL [q(\u03b8)|p(\u03b8|y1:T )] , (23)\nwhere\nKL [q(\u03b8)|p(\u03b8|y1:T )] = Eq[log(q(\u03b8))] \u2212 Eq[log(p(\u03b8,y1:T ))] + log(p(y1:T )) (24)\nand p(\u03b8,y1:T ) = p(y1:T |\u03b8)p(\u03b8). Given that the unknown normalizing constant log(p(y1:T )) in (24) does not depend on q, the (infeasible) optimization problem in (23), is replaced by the equivalent (and feasible) optimization problem:\nq\u2217(\u03b8) := argmax q(\u03b8)\u2208Q {Eq[log(p(\u03b8,y1:T ))] \u2212 Eq[log(q(\u03b8))]} , (25)\nwith the so-called evidence lower bound (ELBO) defined as:\nELBO[q(\u03b8)] := Eq[log(p(\u03b8,y1:T ))]\u2212 Eq[log(q(\u03b8))]. (26)\nThe usefulness of VB is that, for certain models, p(y1:T |\u03b8), and certain choices of Q, the optimization problem in (25) can be solved efficiently using various numerical algorithms. Most notably, for problems in which the dimension of the unknowns, and possibly that of y1:T also, is large, the production of q\u2217(\u03b8) is much faster (often orders of magnitude so) than producing an estimate of p(\u03b8|y1:T ) (and any associated quantities, including predictives) via simulation (Braun and McAuliffe, 2010; Kabisa et al., 2016; Wand, 2017; Koop and Korobilis, 2023). The relationship between (24) and (26), plus the fact that KL[\u00b7] \u2265 0, also means ELBO[q\u2217(\u03b8)] is a lower bound on the logarithm of the \u2018evidence\u2019, or marginal likelihood, p(y1:T ); hence the abbreviation \u2018ELBO\u2019.\nDifferent VB methods are defined by both the choice of Q and the manner in which the optimization is implemented, and we refer the reader to Ormerod and Wand (2010), Blei et al. (2017), and Zhang et al. (2018), for reviews, including algorithmic details for specific VB methods.\nA.8 INLA\nRue et al. (2009) adapted the very early approximation method of Laplace (1774) to approximate posteriors (and associated quantities) in the latent Gaussian model class, which encompasses a large range of \u2013 potentially high-dimensional \u2013 models, including the non-Gaussian state space models that feature heavily in economics and finance. In brief, Rue et al. use a series of nested Laplace approximations, allied with low-dimensional numerical integration, denoting their method by integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) as a result. As with VB, INLA eschews simulation for optimization, exploiting bespoke numerical algorithms designed for the specific (albeit broad) model class. We refer the reader to Rue et al. (2009), Rue et al. (2017), Martino and Riebler (2019), and Wood (2019) for implementation details."
