In the following, we focus on the ?\u0304??\u0304?\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc51 tetraquark with quantum numbers \ud835\udc3c (\ud835\udc3d\ud835\udc43) = 0(1+), which is theoretically simpler compared to other tetraquark candidates because it is QCD-stable. This tetraquark is the counterpart of the \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc51 tetraquark \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50 recently discovered by LHCb [1, 2]. In the past couple of years, several independent lattice QCD studies of ?\u0304??\u0304?\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc5e and ?\u0304?\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc5e systems (\ud835\udc5e denotes a light \ud835\udc62, \ud835\udc51 or \ud835\udc60 quark) were published. These computations employed either exclusively local four-quark interpolating operators [3\u20137] or local and scattering four-quark interpolating operators, but the latter only at the sink [8, 9]. In the work presented here, we include scattering interpolating operators both at the source and at the sink. This allows a more precise determination of finite-volume energy levels not only for bound states, but also for scattering states. This is particularly important for ?\u0304??\u0304?\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc5e systems, where bound states and scattering states are very close, or where bound states do not exist but resonances might exist. An example is a future full lattice QCD investigation of a possibly existing ?\u0304??\u0304?\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc51 tetraquark resonance with \ud835\udc3c (\ud835\udc3d\ud835\udc43) = 0(1\u2212) proposed in Ref.

The plateaus exhibit a strong discrepancy with the expectation discussed in the previous paragraph. The right plot in Figure 1 shows effective masses from a GEVP using both local interpolating operators O1, O2 and O3 as well as scattering interpolating operators O4 and O5 (i.e. corresponding to a 5 \u00d7 5 matrix). These effective masses are consistent with the expectation. Thus, Figure 1 demonstrates that scattering operators are essential for a precise determination of scattering states."

(7)\nThe position of the pole can be obtained via Eqs. (6) and (7).\nThe dark-gray data points in the left plot of Figure 2 represent lattice QCD finite-volume energy levels (ground state and first excitation) for three different volumes \ud835\udc49 = \ud835\udc3f3 with \ud835\udc3f/\ud835\udc4e = 24, 32, 40, but identical \ud835\udc4e \u2248 0.12 fm and \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udf0b \u2248 220 MeV (ensembles a12m220S, a12m220, a12m220L). The orange curves correspond to the two lowest finite volume energy levels as functions of the spatial extent \ud835\udc3f, computed with L\u00fcscher\u2019s finite-volume method using the effective-range expansion (6). There are rather small differences between the finite-volume and infinite-volume energy levels. We attribute this to the large binding energy, \u0394\ud835\udc380 \u2248 O(100 MeV). Scattering analyses are, however, expected to be more important for smaller binding energies (e.g. for the ?\u0304??\u0304?\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc62 system with \ud835\udc3d\ud835\udc43 = 1+) and essential for tetraquark resonances (e.g. for the ?\u0304??\u0304?\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc51 system with \ud835\udc3c (\ud835\udc3d\ud835\udc43) = 0(1\u2212) [10]). The right plot of Figure 2 shows an extrapolation of the tetraquark binding energy in the light \ud835\udc62/\ud835\udc51 quark mass based on the six ensembles listed in Table 1.
