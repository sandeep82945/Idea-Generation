    "abstractText": "Itaconate has emerged as a novel anti-inflammatory and antioxidative endogenous metabolite, yet its role in allergic airway inflammation (AAI) and the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, the itaconate level in the lung was assessed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), and the effects of the Irg1/itaconate pathway on AAI and alveolar macrophage (AM) immune responses were evaluated using an ovalbumin (OVA)-induced AAI model established by wild type (WT) and Irg1\u2212/\u2212 mice, while the mechanism of this process was investigated by metabolomics analysis, mitochondrial/cytosolic protein fractionation and transmission electron microscopy in the lung tissues. The results demonstrated that the Irg1 mRNA/protein expression and itaconate production in the lung were significantly induced by OVA. Itaconate ameliorated while Irg1 deficiency augmented AAI, and this may be attributed to the fact that itaconate suppressed mitochondrial events such as NLRP3 inflammasome activation, oxidative stress and metabolic dysfunction. Furthermore, we identified that the Irg1/itaconate pathway impacted the NLRP3 inflammasome activation and oxidative stress in AMs. Collectively, our findings provide evidence for the first time, supporting the conclusion that in the allergic lung, the itaconate level is markedly increased, which directly regulates AMs\u2019 immune responses. We therefore propose that the Irg1/itaconate pathway in AMs is a potential anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative therapeutic target for AAI.",

            "text": "Asthma is a common chronic airway inflammatory disease, with more than 300 million people suffering worldwide [1]. It is characterized by reversible airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation [1]. Although asthma can be largely controlled, about 5\u201310% of asthmatic patients are poorly controlled by the conventional therapy and strategy such as inhaled corticosteroids [2]. Moreover, the side effects caused by the excessive use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) result in the increasingly high burden of this disease [3]. Itaconate is generated by the decarboxylation of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediate cis-aconitate by aconitate decarboxylase which is encoded by the immune response gene 1 (Irg1) [4]. It is increasingly considered as an important small immune metabolite\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 489. https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox12020489 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/antioxidants\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 489 2 of 19\nwith significant anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative activities [5]. Endogenous itaconate is evidenced to be upregulated [6\u20139] or downregulated [10,11] in several inflammatory diseases. Exogenous administration of itaconate derivatives reportedly inhibits airway inflammation caused by infection. For example, tetraoctyl itaconate (4-OI) decreases the replication of respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV2, Zika and influenza, accompanied with reduced airway inflammation and pathological changes caused by these respiratory viruses [12]. 4-OI has been also demonstrated to attenuate the manifestations of airway inflammation caused by allergens [13,14]. However, in contrast to itaconate derivatives such as 4-OI, knowledge on the role of non-derivatized itaconate in allergic airway inflammation (AAI) is still limited, and the underlying mechanism remains incompletely understood. As the key enzyme for itaconate synthesis, Irg1 is mainly expressed in activated immune cells, and is up-regulated nearly 200-fold in activated macrophages [15]. As we know, alveolar macrophages (AMs) account for more than 90% of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cells under homeostatic conditions. Together with airway epithelial cells, they constitute the first line of defense in the respiratory tract, and their role in the pathogenesis of allergen-induced asthma has attracted more and more attention [16]. Macrophage activation is accompanied by tightly controlled intracellular metabolic reprogramming, in which itaconate is a hallmark. Several studies have implicated the significant role of 4-OI in regulating bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMDM) immune responses upon LPS stimulation such as inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory factors, NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation and M2 polarization [5,14,17,18]. However, the effect of itaconate on AMs\u2019 inflammatory response in AAI remains largely unexplored. The inflammatory response and oxidative stress are closely related and reinforce each other [19]. Mitochondria are the powerhouse of the cell, and are also the major source of cellular ROS, lying at the heart of immunity [20]. Such mitochondrial function is associated with the according changes in their morphology and ultrastructure, as mitochondrial fission mediated by the dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) and the mitochondrial fission 1 protein (Fis1) triggers fragmentation, while the fusion mediated by Optic atrophy (OPA1) and mitofusions (Mfn1 and Mfn2) drives mitochondria elongation, and the mitochondrial dynamic balance protects the cell against oxidative stress [21]. Moreover, mitochondria are also critical for the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Studies have implicated that the translocation of NLRP3 from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to mitochondria or mitochondria-associated ER membranes is considered to precede NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and activation [22,23]. Moreover, a link between mitochondrial malfunction, ROS and NLRP3 inflammasome activation has been proposed in allergic airway diseases [24] and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [25]. Considering the effective anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative function of itaconate, we speculated that itaconate may represent an intrinsic negative regulator of AMs\u2019 inflammatory response in allergic airway diseases, where it regulates the NLRP3 inflammasome activation and oxidative stress. Therefore, in the present study, we firstly investigated whether the level of endogenous itaconate was changed in a murine AAI model, then studied the effect of the exogenous administration of itaconate or deletion of Irg1 on airway inflammation and on primary AMs\u2019 immune responses in response to the repeated OVA challenge, and revealed the underlying regulatory mechanism of itaconate in AAI."

As compared to the vehicle group, four metabolites were significantly upregulated, including metabolites from glycolysis [glucose 6-phosphate (G-6-P),\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 489 12 of 19\nfructose 6-phosphate (F-6-P) and lactate] and oxaloacetate in the OVA group (Figure 6B,C), while they were markedly decreased in the OVA plus itaconate group (Figure 6B,D). Additionally, ten metabolites were significantly decreased, including seven metabolites from the TCA cycle [pyruvate, \u03b1-ketoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, malate, flavin mononucleotide (FMN), adenosine 5\u2032-triphosphate (ATP)] and three metabolites from glycolysis [3-PhosphoD-glycerate (3-PG), Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and Fructose 1,6-biphosphate(F-1,6-P)] in the OVA group in comparison to the vehicle group (Figure 6B, C). However, the itaconate treatment markedly increased these metabolites, except for 3-PG, F-1,6-P and ATP, which were increased but did not reach a statistically significant difference (Figure 6B\u2013D). However, three metabolites from the TCA cycle [isocitrate, citrate and aconitate] were not affected by either the OVA challenge or ITA treatment (Figure 6B\u2013D). To assess whether energy metabolism changes were in parallel with the morphological changes in mitochondria, we examined the ultrastructure of mitochondria using TEM. We found there were mitochondrial structural changes such as swelling, crista loss and ruptures, cavity formation and black dense compact formation in both epithelial cells (Figure 6E) and macrophages (Figure 6F) in an OVA-sensitized and challenged lung compared with the vehicle lung. However, the itaconate treatment improved the morphology of mitochondria to the level comparable to that of the vehicle group (Figure 6E,F). Then, the relative number of abnormal mitochondria was qualified accordingly [32]. The rates of abnormal mitochondria in epithelial cells or macrophages in the OVA group were significantly increased compared with the vehicle group, while the itaconate decreased such increase (Figure 6G,H).

            "text": "Itaconate, an endogenous metabolite from cis-aconitic acid decarboxylation, has been suggested as a critical molecule in the field of immunometabolism in the last few years, and it is involved in the metabolic reprogramming of immune cells and exerts anti-inflammatory effects in macrophages and dendritic cells [5,33,34]. As highly variable endogenous levels of itaconate have been found, itaconate is presumed to be involved in several diseases [6\u201311]. Although the itaconate level was clearly increased in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) pulsed with allergen HDM and STING or HDM alone [13], its level in the allergic lung is unknown. Our present study revealed that the level of itaconate was notably increased in the OVA-challenged lung; correspondingly, lungs from the OVA-challenged group demonstrated a significant induction of Irg1 mRNA and protein expression, suggesting that the elevated Irg1 expression and its derived itaconate production are involved in AAI. At present, itaconate is considered to be synthesized mainly in immune cells such as macrophages. Macrophages are activated by many factors, including LPS [4], as well as by ligands of the toll-like receptor (TLR) [35,36] and STING pathway [37]. These stimuli during inflammatory diseases may increase Irg1 to produce itaconate [6\u20139], and are therefore potential causes of increased endogenous levels of itaconate in human diseases. However, due to the uncertainty as to how exogenous itaconate passes the plasmamembrane, derivatives of itaconate, especially 4-OI, are widely used in the field of itaconate biology. It has been demonstrated that 4-OI can inhibit the airway inflammation caused by respiratory virus infection [12] or allergen inhalation [13,14]. Nevertheless, whether 4-OI is converted into intracellular itaconate is controversial; Swain et al. report that 4-OI does not yield intracellular itaconate accumulation [38], while Hooftman et al. demonstrated that 13C5-labeled OI is converted into 13C5 itaconate intracellularly [18]. Despite this controversy, it is acknowledged that 4-OI induces a strong electrophilic stress response in contrast to itaconate, and therefore its ability to impact certain pathways (such as the ATF3-IKB\u03b6 axis) is higher than itaconate [18,38,39]. Therefore, results obtained with 4-OI may not represent the physiological effect of itaconate. In the present study, unmodified natural itaconate, which has been reported to readily enter cells [38], was administrated to OVA-challenged mice. The results demonstrated that the unmodified itaconate significantly ameliorated the airway inflammation, mucus secretion and Th2 cytokine production. Thus, the exogenous administration of unmodified natural itaconate is capable of suppressing AAI. Then, we aimed to investigate whether the endogenous itaconate contributed to AAI. Using mice lacking Irg1 to establish the murine AAI model, we found that the lack of Irg1\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 489 15 of 19\nresulted in an augmented eosinophilic airway inflammation and Th2 immune response to the OVA allergen. Collectively, these results provide evidence that itaconate production is significantly increased in AAI, adding exogenous itaconate suppressed features of AAI, while blocking endogenous itaconate using the Irg1\u2212/\u2212 mice augmented features of AAI. Therefore, the OVA-induced upregulation of itaconate may be an endogenous protective response to combat the airway inflammation. Our data highlighted the protective role of the endogenous/unmodified natural itaconate in AAI. Given the significant protective role of itaconate in AAI, we asked how it exerts the inhibitory effect on AAI. Itaconate and its derivative 4-OI reportedly induce antiinflammatory effects via mechanisms including specifically blocking the NLRP3 inflammasome activation [18,40], or targeting GAPDH to inhibit the aerobic glycolysis [41]. Moreover, they reportedly demonstrate a potent antioxidant effect through mechanisms including inhibiting the SDH-mediated intracellular mtROS generation [5], and promoting Nrf2 to induce the transcription of the antioxidant genes [17]. Both NLRP3 inflammasome activation and oxidative stress are well-characterized features in AAI [29]. In our present study, the treatment of OVA-challenged mice with itaconate blocked the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, suppressed oxidative stress and inhibited mitochondrial fusion/fission, which may underpin the protective effect of itaconate on AAI. Furthermore, we noted that the mitochondrial localization of NLRP3 [23,31] has been reported to immediately recognize the mitochondrial damage signals such as mtROS and mtDNA, which are sufficient for the NLRP3 inflammasome activation [30]. Therefore, the positioning of NLRP3 on mitochondria is considered to precede the inflammasome activation. We therefore separated the lung tissue into mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions, and found that theNLRP3 inflammasome activation and oxidative stress in the mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions were both significantly increased in OVA-challenged mice. However, only the mitochondrial NLRP3 inflammasome and mitochondrial oxidative stress were inhibited by the itaconate treatment. Consistently, a mitochondria-targeted ROS scavenger, MitoTEMPO, replicated the effect of itaconate, which significantly attenuated the OVAinduced AAI, NLRP3 inflammasome activation, oxidative stress, as well as mitochondrial fusion and fission. These results suggested that mitochondria are the primary targets of itaconate to exert the protective effect on AAI. Itaconate is generated in the mitochondrial matrix [4]; it competitively inhibits the succinate dehydrogenase to regulate the TCA cycle [42]. In asthmatic mice, changes in the TCA cycle intermediate levels have been reported. For example, the plasma organic acid (OA) metabolic profiling analysis reveals that among the detected 7 OAs in the TCA cycle, pyruvate, succinate, fumarate, \u03b1-KG, malate and citrate were reduced, while lactate was increased [43]. In a similar fashion, succinate and fumarate were depleted in the urine from guinea pigs of experimental asthma [44]. Notably, itaconate has reportedly increased the intracellular levels of succinate, \u03b1-KG and glutamate but significantly decreased pyruvate, citrate and malate in cultured neurons [45]. In agreement with these reports, the reduction in TCA cycle OAs but elevation in the lactate level was observed currently in OVA-challenged lungs compared to vehicle lungs. However, itaconate reversed these changes. In particular, the reduction of intermediate OAs in the TCA cycle and elevated lactate level in OVAchallenged mice were similar to previous results observed in asthmatic patients [46\u201348], suggesting that they could serve as biomarkers of asthma. Our present study demonstrated disturbances of OAs\u2019 metabolism in AAI, and provided evidence demonstrating that itaconate exerted a direct impact on the TCA cycle metabolism and glycolysis in AAI, which may be beneficial for improving energy metabolism. We then asked whether energy metabolism changes were in parallel with mitochondrial morphological changes in AAI, and whether they can be modulated by itaconate. Changes in the mitochondrial structure known as mitochondrial dynamics involving size, shape, activity, trafficking and inter-organelle interactions occur depending on the cell\u2019s energy requirements and pathological cellular process, and impact many cell signaling pathways including bioenergetics [49] and immune responses [50]. The pathophysiology of asthma has been re-\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 489 16 of 19\nported to be tightly associated with mitochondrial dysfunction; for example, airway epithelial cells and smooth muscle cells of asthmatic patients show mitochondrial fragmentation and swelling [51,52] and in vivo animal models suggest disturbed mitochondrial function [53,54]. Consistently, we observed more structural changes such as swelling, crista loss and ruptures, cavity formation and black dense compact formation in mitochondria of the epithelial cells and macrophages in OVA-challenged lungs than in vehicle lungs. However, the itaconate treatment inhibited these pathological changes of mitochondria. Taken together, our results suggested that structural changes and the resulting metabolic dysfunction were associated with allergic asthma, and the protective effect of itaconate on AAI may be mediated by improving the mitochondrial metabolic function. Next, we further investigated which cell type was involved in the protective role of itaconate in AAI. Evidence from BMDCs suggested that the Irg1/itaconate pathway in DCs contributes to the resolution of HDM-induced type 2 airway inflammation [13]. However, as in BALF, more than 90% of cells are AMs [55,56]; their role in the pathogenesis of allergen-induced asthma has attracted more and more attention [16]. AMs\u2019 activation occurs immediately after the antigen challenge, which triggers the release of ROS and thereby resulting in an allergic airway reaction [57]. Moreover, NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which is critical in the pathogenesis of asthma, is triggered only in AMs from HDM-challenged mice, indicating that the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the lungs of asthmatic mice is dependent on AMs [58]. Additionally, the key synthesis enzyme for itaconate, Irg1, is mainly expressed in activated immune cells and strongly induced in LPS-activated macrophages [15]. Itaconate and its derivatives have been reported to regulate macrophages such as BMDM immune responses in vitro [5,17]. In the present study, we confirmed that macrophages significantly infiltrated the lung in response to the OVA challenge, and BALF AMs from OVA-challenged mice demonstrated an elevated Irg1 expression as compared to that from the vehicle mice, indicating that the Irg1/itaconate pathway in AMs was involved in the OVA-induced AAI. Consequently, the effect of itaconate on primary AMs\u2019 immune responses in AAI was studied. We revealed that the exogenous itaconate significantly suppressed the OVA-induced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, oxidative stress and mitochondrial fusion/fission in BALF AMs from WT mice, while in AMs from Irg1\u2212/\u2212 mice, the OVA-induced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, oxidative stress and mitochondrial fusion/fission were further augmented. These data suggested that both exogenous and endogenous itaconate directly regulated AMs\u2019 immune responses in allergic airways."
