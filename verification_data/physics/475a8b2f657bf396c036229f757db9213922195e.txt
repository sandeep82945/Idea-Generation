"Further studies will include biosensors capable of detecting biomarkers that could improve the performance of the analytical system for discrimination, classification or authentication. Another research perspective would be the development of a lab-on-a-chip device useful in the routine analysis of olive oil at different stages of production, from harvesting to marketing, and also to analyse oxidative stability."
