This was the ime when the first sources of light were formed, which emitted highnergy X-ray and UV radiation, which in turn heated and reionized he intergalactic medium (see e.g. Barkana & Loeb 2001 ; Furlanetto, h & Briggs 2006 ; Pritchard & Loeb 2012 , for re vie ws).

These experiments can be classified into two different ategories. The first are interferometric experiments, including those sing the GMRT (Paciga et al. 2013 ), HERA (DeBoer et al. 2017 ), OFAR (Ghara et al. 2020 ; Mertens et al. 2020 ), MWA (Barry et al. 019 ; Li et al. 2019 ), PAPER (Kolopanis et al. 2019 ), and SKA Koopmans et al. 2015 ; Mellema et al. 2015 ), which are designed to easure the spatial brightness temperature fluctuations in the 21- m signal using various Fourier statistics. Complementary, there re experiments to detect the sky-averaged 21-cm signal. These xperiments include BIGHORNS (Sokolowski et al. 2015 ), EDGES Bowman et al. 2018 ), LEDA (Price et al. 2018 ), PRIZM (Philip et al. 018 ), REACH (de Lera Acedo et al. 2022 ), SARAS (Singh et al. 018 ; Singh et al. 2021 ). Such experiments are simpler to design han interferometric experiments and require shorter integration ime, but the calibration is more challenging. The dynamic range n the foreground versus 21-cm signal is much larger in global xperiments, by sev eral orders of magnitude.

Ho we ver, the shape nd depth of the identified signal are quite different from the xpectations of standard cosmological and astrophysical models. his unexpected feature either calls for an e xotic e xplanation that ould be achieved by enhancing the contrast between the radio ackground temperature and the spin temperature of the 21-cm signal r there is still some unknown systematic effect in the data. Two hysically moti v ated scenarios for the former explanation include he o v ercooling of h ydrogen g as due to interactions with dark matter Barkana 2018 ; Barkana et al. 2018 ; Berlin et al. 2018 ; Liu et al. 019 ) and the presence of an enhanced radio background other than he CMB (Ewall-Wice et al. 2018 ; Feng & Holder 2018 ; Fialkov & arkana 2019 ; Ewall-Wice, Chang & Lazio 2020 ; Reis, Fialkov & arkana 2020 ). Ho we ver, a re-analysis of the EDGES data has hown that unaccounted systematics can distort or mask the signal Hills et al. 2018 ; Singh & Subrahmanyan 2019 ; Sims & Pober 020 ; Bevins et al. 2021 ). There could also be inadequacies in the oreground model used to fit the observations, which could account or the observed trough (Tauscher, Rapetti & Burns 2020a ). The easurement of the spectrum of the radio sky in 55\u201385 MHz band eported by Singh et al. ( 2021 ) shows, albeit at \u223c2 \u03c3 confidence evel, that the detection of the signal claimed by EDGES might not e entirely of astrophysical origin. In order to make a robust detection of the global 21-cm signal, ne has to o v ercome sev eral observational challenges. First, the oregrounds are 4\u20136 orders of magnitude brighter than the 21- m signal. Galactic synchrotron emission constitutes the largest ontribution to these foregrounds, which is well described by a power aw in frequency i.e. T sync \u221d \u03bd\u2212\u03b1 (Shaver et al. 1999 ). For separating he 21-cm signal from the fore grounds, the ke y is to exploit the pectral differences between them. For example, foregrounds can be onsidered spectrally smooth in contrast with the cosmological 21- m signal. Ho we ver, the gain of the observing antenna has a spatial s well as a spectral variation, which mixes the spatial distribution f the foreground power into the frequency domain and corrupts the ntrinsically smooth foregrounds (Vedantham et al. 2013 ; Bernardi,\ncQuinn & Greenhill 2015 ; Anstey, de Lera Acedo & Handley 021 ; Spinelli et al. 2021 ). These distortions can be sufficiently nonmooth to make them difficult to remo v e from the data using smooth unctions such as polynomials. For this reason, a common goal of ll global signal experiments is to strive for as many achromatic eams as possible, thereby minimizing any potential leakage of the oregrounds into the 21-cm signal.\nTo circumvent this issue, it has been proposed by Vedantham t al. ( 2013 ), Switzer & Liu ( 2014 ), Tauscher et al. ( 2018 ), Rapetti t al. ( 2020 ), Tauscher, Rapetti & Burns ( 2020b ), Bassett et al. 2021 ) to perform the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the eam-weighted foreground modelling set (created by varying the haracteristics of the foreground model) to find the optimal basis ith which to fit the foregrounds instead of assuming any specific odel. In particular, Hibbard et al. ( 2020 ) have shown that in the ase of a perfectly achromatic beam, the basis set obtained from the VD is very similar to polynomials. Ho we ver, there is a noticeable ifference between the two when the beam is chromatic. In the latter ase, the basis obtained from SVD provides a better fit to the beameighted foregrounds than polynomials. A similar approach is used to create a 21-cm modelling set nd obtain a 21-cm basis set from the SVD. In this approach, bservations are jointly fitted by the foreground, and 21-cm basis ets are used to to extract the 21-cm signal. The confidence levels\nn the extracted signal are determined by the noise level of the data nd the covariance between the foreground and 21-cm signal modes. auscher et al. ( 2018 ) utilized the observations of the four Stokes arameters to reduce this o v erlap because the foreground modes ppear in all polarization channels whereas the 21-cm modes only ppear in stokes I. Another strategy for decreasing this o v erlap could e obtained by utilizing the time dependence of foregrounds by fitting ultiple drift-scan spectra simultaneously, as described by Tauscher t al. ( 2020b ). This mitigates the o v erlap between the modes as he foregrounds change as a function of time, but the global 21-cm ignal remains the same across multiple drift-scan spectra. This has lso been found in the Bayesian forward modelling approach within EACH (Anstey, Acedo & Handley 2022 ). In this paper, our focus is to explore the robustness of the REACH ntenna designs for the 21-cm signal extraction. The designs we urrently use are not sensitive to the polarization channels, so we annot utilize this strategy of reducing the o v erlap between the odes, but we do utilize the time dependence of foregrounds to educe the o v erlap. REACH will ev entually be observing the sky imultaneously with multiple antennas, including a hexagonal dipole nd a conical log spiral antenna (Dyson 1965 ).\nThis paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 , we briefly outline he mathematical formalism of the signal extraction. In Section 3 , we escribe the 21-cm signal and foreground simulations and modelling ets for two different foreground models. Section 4 describes the esults for both the models. In Section 5 , we summarize our findings.\nFORMALI SM\nhis section briefly outlines the mathematical formalism of the 21- m signal e xtraction. F or more details, we refer the reader to Tauscher t al. ( 2018 ), Tauscher et al. ( 2020b ). We consider a mock observation\ny , which is composed of the global 21-cm signal y 21 , beam-weighted oregrounds y FG and a Gaussian random noise n with covariance C .\ny = 21 y 21 + y FG + n , (1) here 21 is a matrix that expands the 21-cm signal, which is only function of frequency and not time into the full data vector space. or e xample, when we simultaneously fit the data across multiple ime slices (and antennas), the beam-weighted foregrounds y FG will hange from one time slice (and antenna) to another; ho we ver, y 21 ill remain the same. In that case, 21 expands the 21-cm signal\ncross multiple time bins (and antennas). There are also errors introduced in the data due to imperfect caliration such as additive biases through the receiver\u2019s gain and antenna oise. In this work, we assume a well calibrated instrument and ignore hese sources of uncertainty. The impact of these instrumental errors ill be considered in a future work. These effects have been taken nto account to some extent in Tauscher et al. ( 2021 ). To extract y 21 from the data y , we model the data using the basis ectors (or modes) for the 21-cm signal F 21 and beam-weighted ore grounds F FG , deriv ed from the SVD of their modelling sets. hese modes are further normalized such that F T 21 T 21 C\n\u22121 21 F 21 = I and F T FG C\n\u22121 F FG = I , where I is the identity matrix. The model f our data then takes the form\nM ( x 21 , x FG ) = 21 F 21 x 21 + F FG x FG , (2) here x 21 and x FG are the linear coefficients that scale the basis ector amplitudes contained in F 21 and F FG , respectively. This can e re-written as\nM ( x ) = F x , (3)\nMNRAS 522, 1022\u20131032 (2023)\nM\nFigure 1.

The first term in equation ( 8 ) epresents the goodness of fit and the second term quantifies the odel complexity. We also compare its performance with the ayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and find that minimizing DIC esults in more unbiased fits compared to the BIC. This is consistent ith Tauscher et al. ( 2018 ).\n.1 Statistical measures\no examine and compare the performance of different combinations f antennas, we estimate a few statistical measures. First, we estimate he signal bias statistic defined in Tauscher et al.

It determines the number f \u03c3 at which the uncertainty interval on the extracted signal includes he input 21-cm signal. Now, we can define the uncertainty interval, hich includes the input signal as\nMS 21 = \u03b5 RMS 1 \u03c321 , (10) here \u03b5 and RMS 1 \u03c321 are given from equations ( 9 ) and ( 7 ), respec-\nively.\nFigure 3.

These are shown in the altitude ( \u03b8 ) and azimuth ( \u03c6) coordinates of the antenna\u2019s reference frame with the zenith in the centre.

The choice of our foreground map follows from an indeendent Bayesian analysis of REACH (Anstey et al. 2022 ); ho we ver, physical sky model such as GMOSS (Rao et al. 2016 ) can also e used which encapsulates the effects of radiative processes from ifferent components of the radio sky.

In ig. 2 , we show the o v erhead sk y at 230 MHz on 2019-10-01 0:00:00 UTC for an antenna located in the Karoo radio reserve n South Africa.\nWe convolve this sky model with the beam pattern of the antenna o form the beam-weighted foregrounds as\nFG ( \u03bd, t) = 1 4 \u03c0 \u222b 4 \u03c0 0 G ( \u03b8, \u03c6, \u03bd) T sky ( \u03b8, \u03c6, \u03bd, t) d , (13)\nhere G ( \u03b8 , \u03c6, \u03bd) is the beam pattern of the antenna with the eam centred on the zenith. W ithin REA CH, we consider here three ifferent antenna designs: a dipole, a conical sinuous, and a conical og spiral antenna. In Fig. 3 , we show the beam patterns G ( \u03b8 , \u03c6) f these antennas at three different frequencies \u03bd = 50, 125, and 00 MHz in the antenna\u2019s reference frame. The distortions caused y the chromaticity of these antennas are sufficiently non-smooth o prevent proper fitting by smooth polynomial-based foreground\nodels, thereby masking the 21-cm signal (see fig. 5 of Anstey et al. 2021 )). Our analysis is based on the observations during which the alactic plane remains below the horizon, as these distortions are ore pronounced when the galaxy is abo v e the horizon. To form the beam-weighted foreground modelling set for each ntenna, we use the spectral index \u03b2 as the free parameter, which is aried in the range (2.45, 3.15). In the top panel of Fig. 4 , we show a ubset of the beam-weighted foreground modelling set for the dipole ntenna. The first five modes obtained from the SVD are shown in he bottom panel.\n.2 A detailed for egr ound model\no far, for simplicity, we assumed that the spectral index is constant. n general, a spatial variation of the spectral index across the sky is xpected. This spectral inde x v ariation map is deri ved by calculating he spectral index required to map each pixel of an instance of 2008 lobal Sky Map (GSM) at 408 MHz to the corresponding pixel of n instance at 230 MHz as\n( \u03b8, \u03c6) = log\n( T 230 ( \u03b8,\u03c6) \u2212T CMB T 408 ( \u03b8,\u03c6) \u2212T CMB ) log ( 230 408\n) . (14) In the left-hand panel of Fig. 5 , we show the resulting spectral ndex map. We use this spectral index map to render our mock bservations alongside the GSM as the base foreground map with he beam patterns shown in Fig. 3 .\nTo model the foregrounds in a parametrized way, we divide the sky nto 30 regions and assign a constant spectral index to each region Anstey et al. 2021 ). To form these regions, we divide the full range f spectral indices shown in the left-hand panel of Fig. 5 into 30\nNRAS 522, 1022\u20131032 (2023)\nqual intervals, and each region is defined as the patch of the sky ith spectral indices within these interv als. We sho w the di vision of he sky in the right-hand panel of Fig. 5 . To form the beam-weighted foregrounds, we use equations ( 12 ) nd ( 13 ) with \u03b2( \u03b8 , \u03c6) as the spectral index model. For creating modelling set, we randomly sample the spectral index for each egion \u03b2 i \u2208 (2.45813, 3.14556) for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 30, which results in ifferent spectral index maps. One of these sample maps is shown in he right-hand panel of Fig. 5 . We take 50 000 samples to form the eam-weighted foreground modelling set. In the top panel of Fig. 6 , e show a subset of the modelling set for the dipole antenna. The rst five modes obtained from the SVD are shown in the bottom anel. Once we obtain the modes for the 21-cm signal and the forerounds, we fit the mock observation by selecting the number of odes that minimize the DIC. In Fig. 7 , we show this minimization or a typical observation, where we estimate the DIC o v er a grid of 1-cm and foreground modes. In this case, we select four foreground odes and eleven signal modes, as shown with the blue squared box n the figure.\nRESULTS\nn this section, we discuss the application of this formalism in the 1-cm signal extraction with different antenna designs for the two oreground models that we consider.\nFigure 5.

In each case, the simulated ock observation is generated by taking a 21-cm signal from ts modelling set and a foreground component from the simple oreground modelling set (see Section 3.1 ). In the first row, we show he extracted signal when we fit the data for a single time slice. The\nhaded regions represent the 1 \u03c3 confidence intervals. In this case, he pipeline fails to extract the 21-cm signal as the RMS uncertainty or any antenna design remains around 1000 mK. This happens due o a significant covariance between the foreground and 21-cm signal\nodes. Ho we ver, we note that in each case, the \u03c72 \u2248 1, which ndicates that the full data gets a good fit by choice of basis vectors rom the minimization of the DIC.\nTo reduce the o v erlap between the fore ground and 21-cm signal odes, we simultaneously fit the data from multiple time slices. hile doing so, we utilize the correlations between different time lices and enforce that the 21-cm signal does not change between hese slices. In the second row of Fig. 8 , we show the signal estimates hile simultaneously fitting four time bins. We see that the signal xtraction significantly impro v es with an RMS uncertainty of around 0 mK for any antenna design. These findings are consistent with the arlier studies by Tauscher et al. ( 2020b ).\nNext, we demonstrate how we can utilize the multiple antenna esigns within REACH to impro v e the extraction of the 21-cm signal\nMNRAS 522, 1022\u20131032 (2023)\nM\nFigure 8. Extracted 21-cm signals for the mock observation were generated from a physical 21-cm signal and a foreground model taken from the simple foreground modelling set for dipole (left), conical sinuous (middle), and conical log spiral (right) antenna while simultaneously fitting one time slice (top) and four time slices (bottom). The shaded region represents the 1 \u03c3 confidence region, and the black line shows the input 21-cm signal.\nFigure 9.

For this, we compare the signal extraction from a single ntenna with the extraction from multiple antennas in Fig. 9 . Note hat we assumed a total integration time of 24 h for both scenarios. n the left-hand panel of Fig. 9 , we fit the data for a single time slice, here we can clearly see the advantage of simultaneously fitting the ata from multiple antennas. In this case, the RMS uncertainty of he single antenna fit (cyan) is 747 mK, which reduces to 23 mK for\nultiple antennas (orange). This happens because simultaneously tting multiple antennas utilizes the correlations between different ntennas and enforces that the global 21-cm signal does not depend n the antenna design, thereby reducing the covariance between the oreground and 21-cm modes. In the right-hand panel of Fig. 9 , we imultaneously fit the data from two time slices. In this case, the MS uncertainty of the single antenna fit (cyan) is 32 mK, which educes to 11 mK for three antennas (orange). Also, in this case, we nd that fitting the data from multiple antennas results in a lower ncertainty on the extracted 21-cm signal with a slightly reduced ias, although this impro v ement is not as pronounced, as it is for a ingle time slice (the left-hand panel). This is because fitting multiple\nNRAS 522, 1022\u20131032 (2023)\nime slices (the right-hand panel) even for a single antenna already emo v es a significant o v erlap between the foreground and 21-cm odes. To better understand the extent to which multiple antennas tend o impro v e the fit, we quantify the statistical measures of the xtracted 21-cm signal that we discussed in Section 2.1 . First, e estimate the RMS uncertainty on the extracted signal for an nsemble of 5000 different mock observations, which are generated y randomly sampling a 21-cm and foreground component from heir modelling sets. In the top panel of Fig. 10 , we show the umulative distribution function (CDF) of the RMS uncertainty for e ven dif ferent configurations that can be formed from the three ntenna designs we considered. In each case, we fit the data from single time slice and assume the total integration time to be 6 h, hich is distributed evenly in the analysis of multiple antennas. he advantage of having multiple antennas can be clearly noticed s the distribution for multiple antennas tends to wards lo wer RMS ncertainty lev els. F or a single antenna, 68 per cent (and 95 per cent) f the 5000 different mock observations are extracted within 954 mK\nFigure 10. Top panel: CDF of RMS uncertainty level on the extracted signal estimated from 5000 different mock observations for the simple foreground model. Different colours in the plot represent different combinations of antennas used in the analysis. The uncertainty levels at 68 and 95 per cent for each combination are shown in Table 1 . Bottom panel: Probability distribution function (PDF) of the normalized \u03c72 statistic estimated from 5000 different mock observations for different combinations of antennas.\nTable 1. This tabulates the RMS uncertainty level (in mK) on the extracted 21-cm signal for 68 and 95 per cent of the mock observations, and the variance of the PDF of \u03c72 for different antenna configurations shown in Fig. 10 for the simple foreground model.\nConfiguration RMS | 68 per cent RMS | 95 per cent \u03c3 ( \u03c72 ) Dipole 1807.64 8101.69 0.119 Logspiral 572.70 3054.16 0.118 Sinuous 954.46 5568.83 0.122 Dipole + Logspiral 64.61 161.84 0.083 Dipole + Sinuous 55.96 159.41 0.083 Logspiral + Sinuous 70.52 212.96 0.085 Dipole + Logspiral + Sinuous 45.83 125.49 0.067\n< o a < m 1 c\nf n a A d i v \u03c3 T\n4\nN ( f + + d b m\nt m c m t t c s b r s o 2\nd f p f e a w\ne f t a a a t b t d m T p c\nt s c\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/522/1/1022/7110983 by U niversity of G roningen user on 21 April 2023\nRMS < 1808 mK (and 5568 mK < RMS < 8102 mK). For a pair f antennas, 68 per cent (and 95 per cent) of the mock observations re extracted within 55 mK < RMS < 71 mK (and 159 mK < RMS 213 mK). For three antennas, 68 per cent (and 95 per cent) of the ock observations are extracted with RMS < 46 mK (and RMS < 26 mK). These values are tabulated in Table 1 for different antenna onfigurations.\nIn the bottom panel of Fig. 10 , we show the probability distribution unction (PDF) (from 5000 different mock observations) of the ormalized \u03c72 , which quantifies how well the set of foreground nd 21-cm modes fit the data for all seven antenna configurations. s we include more antennas in the fit, the quality of the fit to the ata impro v es as the variance of the \u03c72 distribution decreases, and t becomes more centred around \u03c72 = 1. For a single antenna, the ariance of the distribution \u03c3 ( \u03c72 ) \u223c 0.12. For a pair of antennas, ( \u03c72 ) \u223c 0.083, which reduces to \u03c3 ( \u03c72 ) \u223c 0.067 for three antennas. hese values for different configurations are tabulated in Table 1 .\n.2 Detailed for egr ound model\next, we discuss the results for a more realistic foreground model see Section 3.2 ). In Fig. 11 , we show the extracted 21-cm signal or three different antenna configurations: (i) dipole (left), (ii) dipole conical log spiral (middle), and (iii) dipole + conical sinuous conical log spiral (right). In each case, we simultaneously fit the ata from four time bins, and the mock observation is generated y taking a 21-cm signal and a foreground component from their odelling sets. As expected, when considering a more realistic foreground model, he signal extraction is worse than it was for the simple foreground odel, particularly for single antenna analysis. For example, if we ompare the extracted signal from a dipole for the detailed foreground odel (left-hand panel of Fig. 11 ) with the extracted signal for he simple foreground model (bottom left-hand panel of Fig. 8 ), he RMS uncertainty on the extracted signal is larger (123 mK in omparison to 21 mK). In addition, the extracted signal is also ignificantly biased. This happens because of a larger covariance etween the foreground and the 21-cm signal modes, where the ealistic foregrounds introduce an additional frequency-dependent tructure in the higher-order foreground modes (see the bottom panel f Fig. 6 ). Evidently, it is suboptimal to use just a single antenna for 1-cm signal extraction with such foreground models. We can impro v e this e xtraction if we utilize different antenna esigns. F or e xample, when we simultaneously fit the observations rom a dipole and a conical log spiral antenna, as shown in the middle anel of Fig. 11 , the uncertainty on the extracted signal decreases rom 123 to 69 mK, and it also remo v es some of the bias in the xtracted signal. This can be further impro v ed by including all three ntennas in the fitting, as shown in the right-hand panel of the figure, here the RMS uncertainty on the extracted signal is 37 mK. We also estimate the CDF of the RMS uncertainty on the xtracted signal from 2000 different mock observations formed rom the detailed foreground model in the top panel of Fig. 12 for hree different antenna configurations. The distribution for multiple ntennas tends to wards lo wer RMS uncertainty lev els. F or three ntennas, 68 per cent (and 95 per cent) of the mock observations re extracted with RMS < 124 mK (and < 281 mK) in comparison o RMS < 297 mK (and < 971 mK) for a single antenna. In the ottom panel, we show the PDF of the normalized \u03c72 statistic of he fit for the detailed foreground model. The variance of the \u03c72 istribution decreases from \u03c3 ( \u03c72 ) = 0.061 to 0.034, as we include ore antennas in our fit. These values are tabulated in Table 2 . hese results suggest that utilizing different antenna designs is quite owerful for extracting cosmological signals when considering more omplicated foreground models.\nHo we ver, the performance of the signal extraction depends on how he 21-cm signal and foregrounds are simulated in their modelling ets.

We simultaneously fit the data for all three ntennas from four time slices. In this scenario, we can reco v er he 21-cm signal with the simple foreground model (cyan) with easonable accuracy. The minimization of DIC, in this case, requires ore 21-cm modes to fit the data. Ho we v er, the signal e xtraction s significantly biased for our detailed foreground model (orange) ecause of the more significant covariance between the foreground nd 21-cm modes. This could become substantially more challenging hen one includes the uncertainties in the foreground model as well. SUMMARY\nn this article, we have shown a method to utilize multiple different ntenna designs in the global 21-cm signal extraction. Our analysis s based on the current approach of the REACH experiment, but it an easily be generalized to any global 21-cm signal experiment. ur formalism for extracting the 21-cm signal is based on fitting he modes derived from the SVD of the 21-cm signal, and beameighted foreground modelling sets (Tauscher et al. 2018 ; Tauscher t al. 2020b ). We demonstrated the impact of utilizing multiple antennas to better onstrain the 21-cm signal by considering two different foreground odels (i) A simple foreground model, where we assumed the pectral index to be constant across the sky and used that spectral ndex to create a modelling set, and (ii) A more realistic foreground\nm t\nt d w u o s t o m\nm m a p r s s r l\ni a f m m T s p m w t t P\nA\nW G h f V s E (\nD\nA S r\nR\nA A A\nB\nB B\nB B\nB B\nB B\nB B\nB\nB C\nD d d\nD E\nE F F F F G H H\nK\nK K K\nL L\nM\nM M M P P\nP P R R R R\nS\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/522/1/1022/7110983 by U niversity of G roningen user on 21 April 2023\nodel, where we considered a variation of the spectral index across he sky, divided into 30 regions.\nWe find that for the simple foreground model, we can extract he signal with any antenna design when we simultaneously fit the ata for multiple time slices. This extraction is further impro v ed hen we include multiple different antennas in our fitting. To better nderstand this impro v ement, we quantify some statistical measures f the extracted 21-cm signal for an ensemble of different mock obervations. For multiple antennas, the CDF of the RMS uncertainties ends towards lower RMS uncertainty levels. In addition, the variance f the PDF decreases as we include more antennas, and it becomes ore centred around \u03c72 = 1. The impact of including multiple antennas in the fitting becomes ore pronounced when we consider the more realistic foreground odel in the mock observation. In that case, with only a single ntenna, even when we fit the data for multiple time bins, we cannot recisely reco v er the 21-cm signal. Both the large RMS of the econstructed signal and the significant bias show that only using a ingle antenna is likely, but not sufficient, to reco v er the cosmological ignal. Instead, when we use multiple antennas of different types, we educe the bias in the extracted signal and also the RMS uncertainty evel by a factor of 2\u20133.\nThe signal extraction presented in this analysis could be further mpro v ed by measuring all four Stokes parameters from different ntennas instead of only Stokes I (Tauscher et al. 2020b ). This could urther reduce the covariance between the signal and foreground odes and could be crucial for analysing more detailed foreground odels, which o v erlap more significantly with the 21-cm models. his will be considered in a future work. We also plan to utilize the pectral constraints derived in this paper to calculate the full posterior robability distribution of any signal parameter space of choice while arginalizing o v er the linear fore ground modes (Rapetti et al. 2020 ), hich results in a tighter constraint on the 21-cm signal. To derive hese constraints, one can quickly scan the parameter space by using he sk y-av eraged 21-cm signal emulators (Cohen et al. 2020 ; Bye, ortillo & Fialkov 2022 ).\nC K N OW L E D G E M E N T S\ne thank the Center for Information Technology of the University of roningen for their support and for providing access to the Peregrine igh performance computing cluster.
