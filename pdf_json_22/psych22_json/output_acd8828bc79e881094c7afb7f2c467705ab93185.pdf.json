    "abstractText": "Background: Exploring parental motives for providing smartphones and tablets to young children is important to better understand ways to optimise healthy use of mobile screens in early childhood. To date, no study has qualita\u2010 tively examined the factors underpinning parental motives of providing mobile screens to young children, using a theoretically driven approach. Methods: We conducted 45 in\u2010depth, semi structured online interviews with primary caregivers of toddlers and pre\u2010schoolers from diverse family backgrounds who participated in a large online survey in Australia. Themes were generated from the transcribed interviews using template thematic analysis. The coding was completed deductively using the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) and data\u2010driven induction. Results: Participants consistently reported a spectrum of attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control aspects which drove their decision to provide or not provide a mobile screen device to their child. Five main descriptive themes were generated, guided by the TPB: (1) Convenience, connection, and non\u2010traditional learning experience; (2) Negative behavioural consequences and potential activity displacement through mobile screens; (3) Influences of society and resources; (4) Managing and achieving a balance; (5) External challenges. Conclusions: Overall, the findings demonstrated that parents experienced cognitive dissonance between their attitudes and behaviour, primarily from perceived behavioural control and subjective norms negating the influence of attitudes on their motives to provide a device. These insights offer important avenues for public health messaging and resources to better involve and support parents in decision\u2010making relating to mobile screens in everyday lives of",

Themes were generated from the transcribed interviews using template thematic analysis. The coding was completed deductively using the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) and data\u2011driven induction.\nResults: Participants consistently reported a spectrum of attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control aspects which drove their decision to provide or not provide a mobile screen device to their child. Five main descriptive themes were generated, guided by the TPB: (1) Convenience, connection, and non\u2011traditional learning experience; (2) Negative behavioural consequences and potential activity displacement through mobile screens; (3) Influences of society and resources; (4) Managing and achieving a balance; (5) External challenges.\nConclusions: Overall, the findings demonstrated that parents experienced cognitive dissonance between their attitudes and behaviour, primarily from perceived behavioural control and subjective norms negating the influence of attitudes on their motives to provide a device. These insights offer important avenues for public health messaging and resources to better involve and support parents in decision\u2011making relating to mobile screens in everyday lives of young children.\nKeywords: Mobile device use, Mobile screen media, Early childhood, Parenting, Screen time\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

The potential for prolonged screen time by young children has been exacerbated by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic [4\u20136] and pandemic-related changes such as online learning, working from home, and limited in-person social interaction opportunities. Nevertheless, there is limited qualitative research investigating early childhood mobile screen use and the implications for effective device\n*Correspondence: smallawaarachch@deakin.edu.au\n1 School of Psychology, Deakin University, Burwood, Australia Full list of author information is available at the end of the article\nmanagement in the home. The portability, internet connectivity, unlimited curated content and multi-functionality of mobile devices are appealing features for young users, and tend to promote more solitary than shared use [7]. Given that parents or caregivers are typically the gatekeepers of technology access for toddlers and preschoolers, a major step towards better understanding the potential risks and benefits of smartphones and tablets in early childhood is to empirically study the beliefs, reasons and motivations for parents\u2019 provision of mobile screen devices to their children [8]."

            "text": "The Interactional Theory of Child Problematic Media Use [9] is a theoretical representation of the ways in which excessive or prolonged screen media use in early childhood may interfere with typical early childhood functioning. Of the myriad factors (for example, child behaviour, household dynamics, parent\u2013child relationship) associated with early childhood screen use, parents are thought to exert several salient proximal influences. First, parents are the main providers of smartphones and tablets to young children in household settings [10]. Second, parents\u2019 own use can serve as a calibration point for what they may perceive as \u2018normal\u2019 use within society and for their children [9]. Third, parents\u2019 own device usage habits and patterns will be modelled by their children through observational learning, normalizing their use for recreation and other purposes [11]. Fourth, when parental device engagement is high, it may reduce sensitivity to, or awareness of, their child\u2019s needs. This is thought to be because parental screen absorption can potentially limit the effective interpretation of, and contingent responding to, their child\u2019s cues for attention [12]. Finally, broader parenting attitudes about family socialization and boundary-setting may influence parents\u2019 decisions about whether or not to provide mobile screens and how to regulate their use within the household [13].\nPrevious research has explored the relationship between parenting factors and traditional screen time (e.g., television and gaming consoles) in early childhood (see Xu et\u00a0al., 2015 [14] for a review) and more recently contemporary screen media such as smartphones and tablets (e.g., [15, 16]). Factors tested include parenting practices [17, 18], parental perceptions of screen media use [19\u201321], parenting styles [22, 23] and parental selfefficacy in managing screen time [24, 25]. This research has largely undertaken a quantitative approach [15, 16, 26, 27], while qualitative studies have been relatively scarce [28\u201330]. Qualitative methodologies offer depth and richness in understanding diverse parent experiences, beliefs and behaviours [31]. Qualitative studies\nalso complement quantitative findings and inform new directions in the area [32]. To date, qualitative studies have employed either \u2018small Q\u2019 or \u2018thin\u2019 data through qualitative surveys [29] or have been data-driven to generate themes [28, 30]. To our knowledge, no study has used a structured hybrid (deductive and inductive) descriptive approach to gain an in-depth understanding of factors that underpin parent decision-making and practices around early childhood use of mobile screens."

            "text": "The present study employed a structured theoretical approach to understanding parent decision-making and practices as they pertain to the study aims. The Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB; [33]) is a well-established model in health research that describes the attitudes, normative beliefs and perceived behavioural control that drive intentions and behaviour (see Hamilton et\u00a0al. 2020 [34] for a review). The three main components of the TPB are; (1) Attitudes: the appraisal or evaluation of the possible outcomes of a particular behaviour; (2) Subjective norms: the perceived social pressure (i.e., expectations from other people) to engage or not engage in the behaviour; (3) Perceived behavioural control: the level of confidence in one\u2019s capacity to engage or not engage in the behaviour [33]. Previously, the TPB has been a useful quantitative framework for understanding parents\u2019 beliefs and decisions, and successfully predicted followup screen-related behaviours in early childhood [35, 36]. However, to date, no study has used the TPB to qualitatively assess parent decision-making and motives with respect to use of mobile screens in early childhood."

Habits formed in early childhood lay a foundation for later development of lifestyle patterns including diet, physical activity, and screen use [38]. Before recommending appropriate and nuanced actionable targets for early awareness and interventions, it is necessary to first understand parents\u2019 attitudes towards, and motives for, providing mobile screen devices in early childhood. Accordingly, the current study aimed to explore the factors underpinning parents\u2019 attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control with respect to toddler and pre-schooler smartphone or tablet use through the lens of the TPB."

Parents who took part in this survey were invited to participate in an online interview to discuss their views and experiences of smartphone and tablet use in early childhood. The study received ethics approval from the authors\u2019 Institutional Human Research Ethics Committee (HEAG_H_234_2020).\nThis study assumed a limited realism philosophical position with a critical realist approach in viewing the research and its data. This position holds that \u2018reality is out there\u2019 and that through science, our knowledge will eventually approximate that reality. It also acknowledges that researchers\u2019 quest for knowledge is limited in time and space and bound by current theory, evidence and methods of evaluation, and therefore is characterised by a-priori themes [39]. We adopted a constructivist epistemological stance, as we understand knowledge is constructed within different settings, times and situations. We therefore aimed to develop an account of participants\u2019 viewpoints and experiences that is trustworthy and potentially transferable, while acknowledging conclusions drawn are tentative [40]. Quality checks through collaboration to stimulate critical thinking and fresh perspectives, maintaining audit trails using annotated coding templates and practicing reflexivity by acknowledging researcher subjectivity are encouraged in this approach [40], and were employed by our team.\nIn relation to reflexivity, the contribution of each researcher\u2019s position and personal experience to the interpretation of the data were considered [41]. Our team are Australian residents, with two parents (WS-S and MH) and two non-parents (SM and SH), allowing both type of perspectives to be considered during analysis. The expertise of the team varied across human\u2013computer interaction (SM and SH), child development (MH) and educational research methodologies (WS-S) to ensure the interpretation of data is conducted across multiple lenses and professional beliefs.\nIt is important to also acknowledge that the data collection took place during the second year of the COVID19 pandemic. Our participants were from various states across Australia and exposed to varying lockdown restrictions and circumstances. We recognize that the stay-at-home directions and limited opportunities for travel and social interactions potentially influenced families in their decisions related to screen time and may have amplified their emotions and concerns related to parenting [42]."

Of the 52 participants that expressed their interest in participating in the interviews, 45 were included in the final sample using a purposive sampling matrix (see Additional File 1). Seven of the participants who expressed their interest were subsequently unavailable or not contactable. Participants who volunteered were predominantly female, however, we ensured that all males (N = 2) who expressed interest were included in the final sample. The purposive sampling matrix helped to ensure diversity in characteristics and backgrounds given the important role of parent demographic factors, parenting styles, and associated attitudes in device use by young children [13]. Participation in the online interview was voluntary and did not affect participation in the overall study.

The interview followed a semi-structured format with primary (main) open-ended questions asked in each interview. A set of secondary questions (prompts) for each primary question served as a guide for clarification if needed. This format allows the interviewer to be guided by topics while also permitting flexibility in conversation [40]. Each interview lasted between 17 to 76\u00a0 min with an average duration of 37\u00a0 min. Six researchers who were trained on the standardized interview protocol conducted the interviews. After pilot testing, the team members determined that two interview schedules (see Additional File 2) were necessary. This was due to parents\u2019 and caregivers\u2019 eagerness to discuss their views at length on wide-ranging topics of inquiry which often resulted in excessively long interview durations. Hence, Schedules A and B were developed to overlap in some key areas of screen use. The two schedules branched out on topics that were important to parents and the research aims but that could not feasibly be included in a single interview. For example, both schedules comprised core research questions such as parental perceptions of early childhood screen use, but also had distinct aspects of interest such as perceptions on provision of devices (Schedule A) or perceptions on managing young children\u2019s screen use (Schedule B). Prior to the interviews, participants were purposefully allocated to schedule A or B, matched on their demographic characteristics."

Template thematic analysis [43] was used to examine and identify the shared patterns and meanings across the data. This \u2018codebook\u2019 type of thematic analysis encourages efficiency in analysis [44, 45] and aims to maintain a balance between structure and flexibility in coding [46]. Hybrid inductive and deductive coding were used in the present study. A-priori themes (deductive coding) provided structure and guidance very early in the analysis as a lens through which to view the data, while also allowing the data to guide the identification of shared patterns and meanings within the themes (inductive data-driven coding). The a-priori themes also helped to focus on the areas of greater relevance to our research question and to avoid potentially redundant or repetitious coding [45]. A-priori themes were deemed appropriate for this study given the large number of interviews conducted by multiple researchers [45]. Themes were developed (illustrated in Fig.\u00a0 1) using the components from the well-established Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB; [33]).\nThe following series of steps were undertaken to complete the template analysis of the transcribed interviews: (1) familiarization with the data (SM, SH); (2) preliminary coding of initial sub-set of 16 interviews (SM); (3) clustering and organizing of initial themes \u2013 this involved modifying the a-priori themes and generating additional sub-themes that arose within codes (SM, SH); (4)\nproducing the initial coding framework through collapsing of codes (SM, SH, in consultation with WS-S); (5) coding of the remaining 29 interviews (in three sub-sets of 10, 10 and 9) applying the coding template through an iterative process (SM); (6) finalizing of the coding framework, themes and sub-themes (all authors).\nAs per King\u2019s (2012) recommendations, several quality checks were performed throughout the analysis process to enhance the quality of the data; (a) critical comparisons of codes, themes and sub-themes through weekly discussions among the team members and (b) the compilation of an audit trail to document the iterative changes to the coding framework over time."

The themes provided a concise summary of the attitudes,\nsubjective norms and perceived behavioural control underpinning the motives for giving or not giving a device to a toddler or pre-schooler. Key themes and subthemes are summarised in the following text, together with illustrative quotes describing each sub-theme. The\nvisual mapping of the themes as they relate to the a-priori TPB model is illustrated in Fig.\u00a02. A tabular summary of the sub-themes under each theme is further included as Additional File 3.\nTheme 1: Positive attitudes: Convenience, connection and\u00a0non\u2011traditional learning experience For many parents, enabling their child to form and maintain connections with geographically distributed family and friends was a very common positive perception, which often influenced the decision to provide a mobile screen device (1.1 Keeping families connected). Parents also stated that this positive attitude towards screen use was intensified amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, where restrictions limited opportunities for social interactions. Mobile screens often ensured the continuation of important family relationships:\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always had grandparents that lived a decent distance away, so she wouldn\u2019t have a relationship with them if she couldn\u2019t FaceTime\u201d (Mother of a 2-yo, 42 yo, one child).\nParents also believed in the educational value of using a mobile screen device to foster their children\u2019s learning and skills (1.2 Screens as the new teachers). Many parents used the terms \u201ceducational\u201d, \u201cinteractive\u201d or \u201clearning\u201d when describing positive use of mobile screens. They viewed screen use as beneficial insofar as it is a non-traditional learning experience which has the dual benefit of keeping their child engaged:\n\u201cI think we\u2019re better off for having them\u2026..he isn\u2019t that interested in writing or drawing. Using an app gives him that opportunity to be interactive with his learning. And that\u2019s\u2026 a real positive.\u201d (Mother of a 2-yo, 43 yo, 4 children)\nSome parents also believed that using these devices early in life equips young children to better face the foreseeable tech-focused future, especially in educational and employment settings (1.3 Digital future-proofing).\n\u201cI see more and more reliance on technology, and I feel it should probably be at a disadvantage more than an advantage by not having access to it and having the ability to use it successfully.\u201d (Mother of a 3-yo, 36 yo, one child)\nConversely, several parents believed that using a device at an early age was not particularly advantageous as undoubtedly children would pick up the necessary skills as they grow older, given the intuitive nature of digital interfaces.\n\u201cBut \u2026like learning to use iPads in kindy [kindergarten] \u2026if a one year old can learn to use it in a"

Many parents who regularly used the device for this purpose mentioned that screens were very effective at keeping their child distracted or entertained and that without it parental exhaustion would be overwhelming.\n\u201c\u2026 because we\u2019re playing together and interacting all the other times of the day, that hour or two for me is the only chance to get other things done or just a break from \u201cMum, mum, mum, mum\u201d and all these endless stories about everything.\u201d (Mother of a 3-yo, 36 yo, one child)\nWhile some parents viewed this option as \u201clazy\u201d (Mother of a 1-yo, 34 yo, one child), some justified it as \u201cpretty standard\u201d (Mother of a 3-yo, 36 yo, one child). Several parents positively viewed the device as an effective\nway for their child to unwind and relax following a tiring or very active day (1.5 Digital downtime), for instance,\n\u201cif they\u2019re not napping, they still do need a bit of downtime, they\u2019re very busy little people.\u201d (Mother of a 2-yo, 43 yo, 4 children).\nTheme 2: Negative attitudes: Negative behavioural consequences and\u00a0potential activity displacement Parents were concerned about devices supplanting real social interactions and opportunities for family bonding (2.1 There is no \u2018real connection\u2019):\n\"The worst bit is when .. you hand them your phone and then you\u2019re like well now I\u2019ve got nothing to do either. I\u2019m just going to sit and stare at you playing on the phone.\" (Mother of a 4-yo, 37 yo, 2 children)\nSome parents noted that screen experiences were not analogous to real-world experiences and that there was a risk that screen-version-of-life could dominate children\u2019s worlds. This further ties in with the common notion many parents had around the opportunity costs of providing a device to a young child:\n\u201cLook out the window or we\u2019ll have other activities, colouring in or books \u2026and that\u2019s what we use for stimulation, and we play games in the car, you know, like eye spy .. We overtly avoid screens.\u201d (Father of a 5-yo, 40 yo, 2 children)\nParents were often regretful about the lost opportunities for traditional activities such as creative play, physical activity and hands-on exploration of natural environments due to the use of mobile screen devices (2.2 Old ways are the best ways). Some parents also believed in the value of boredom for their child and felt that screen time had become a \u2018cure\u2019 for boredom. Parents were concerned that a lack of boredom might mean that their child might not experience opportunities that foster their own creativity, innovative thinking and self-motivation for learning (2.3 \u201cBoredom is a gift\u201d):\n\u201c.. it\u2019s just a really easy form of entertainment for them and if they get that too early on, I think then they haven\u2019t developed that way of: (a) being bored, which is a talent to be okay with being bored; and then (b) to have internal intrinsic motivation to go find something to do or to make your own activity up or whatever.\u201d (Mother of a 4-yo, 33 yo, one child)\nConcerns among parents about significant patterns of unfavourable behavioural consequences they have observed, i.e., tantrums, aggressive or hyperactive behaviour, crying, following prolonged use of screens were highly prevalent (2.4 Agitated and overstimulated). It was a recurrent negative attitude towards providing mobile screen devices:\n\u201c.. when they have a lot of tablet time and TV time, they\u2019re just rat bags (sic). ..They don\u2019t listen, they\u2019re really cranky, .. we really need to like.. \u2018Okay, we\u2019re going for a walk now.\u2019 It sort of reset their brain a bit.\u201d (Father of a 4-yo, 29 yo, 2 children)\nFurthermore, some parents described using a device as a circumstantial distractor, but then that they lost track of time and facilitated more screen time than was intended. Parents reported that stopping use in these circumstances often led to tantrums which they found difficult to deal with and that they would rather not give the device at all to avoid dealing with post-device tantrums (Mother of a 2-yo, 31 yo, 2 children).\nThe persuasive nature of the mobile screen content often worried parents as they felt that the more their children used mobile screens, the more reliant on them they became (2.5 Hooked on screens). Numerous parents claimed screen content to be \u201caddictive\u201d or\n\u201coverstimulating\u201d, resulting in their children \u201cgetting engrossed\u201d (Mother of a 4-yo, 42 yo, 4 children), \u201cconsumed\u201d (Mother of a 4-yo, 34 yo, 2 children) or \u201ccompletely absorbed\u201d (Mother of a 1 -yo, 34 yo, one child):\n\u201c Lots of colours, flashing lights, \u2026 they\u2019re doing whatever they can to get an audience from people, and its immediate reactions, they don\u2019t have to work hard for \u2026a lot of content that they would be accessing.\u201d (Mother of a 3-yo, 28 yo, one child)\nThey believed this attachment to the device and its content also stems from a growing sense of autonomy and agency by the child:\n\u201c..she\u2019s at that age where she really wants to have the screen all the time and to hang onto it and to play with it and walk around with it.\u201d (Mother of a 4-yo, 40 yo, 2 children).\nThe commercialisation of screen content including advertising and in-app purchases contributed to further worry about the age-appropriateness of content as \u201cthere\u2019s so many adverts coming up that I don\u2019t want him to have access to\u201d (Mother of a 1-yo, 44 yo, one child). In particular, parents of younger children or toddlers were apprehensive about whether screen use at such an early age could be positive and meaningful given that their child lacked understanding about the nature of the device, as \u201cthey\u2019re just clicking away. That freaks me out.\u201d (Mother of a 3-yo, 35 yo, one child). Parents felt as though their child was just attracted to the things that are \u201cbright, colourful, cute and moving, the music and the cutesy voices\u201d (Mother of a 3-yo, 35 yo, one child).\nTheme 3: Subjective norms: Influences of\u00a0society and\u00a0resources Many parents reported their experiences of social pressures that influenced their decision-making with respect to early childhood device use. A salient reflection of many parents was the judgment and pressure they experienced from others (parents and non-parents) to manage their child\u2019s behaviour, which resulted in seeking the most convenient pacifying option. In most cases, it was to give their child a mobile screen device (3.1 Parenting for other people\u2019s comfort):\n\u201c\u2026 I felt really embarrassed, so I sat in the restaurant and apologised the whole way through the meal, .. I couldn\u2019t \u2013 so I gave him my phone.\u201d (Mother of a 1-yo, 34 yo, one child)\nHowever, conversely, parents also commented that they had experienced judgment from others, particularly\nextended family members or friends, when their child was using a mobile screen in a public space:\n\u201cI don\u2019t really let him use it in public, more so because I\u2019m worried about people judging me \u2026 which sounds really awful. \u2026 - say from my parents, they were .. like, \u2018Oh, what are you doing?\u201d (Mother of a 3-yo, 32 yo, 2 children)\nParents reported that this was often perceived as a \u201clazy\u201d parenting option by others (Mother of a 1-yo, 34 yo, one child), which led them to believe so themselves. Parents often described this dilemma as \u201ca double-edged sword\u201d (Mother of a 2-yo, 28 yo, one child), \u201cyou\u2019re damned if you do, you\u2019re damned if you don\u2019t\u201d (Mother of a 4-yo, 33 yo, one child) or \u201cyou\u2019re screwed either way\u201d (Mother of a 2-yo, 32 yo, 2 children). The perception of social acceptability of the provision of mobile screens to young children was also a normative belief which drove the decision-making for some parents (3.2 Following the herd). While some termed it as \u201cwell, everybody else does it\u201d or \u201csuccumbing to the majority\u201d (Mother of a 4-yo, 40 yo, one child), there were a minority of parents who felt that \u201cit would be great if every parent was on that same page; then there would be no pressure from other kids too\u2026, there\u2019d be no peer pressure\u201d (Mother of a 5-yo, 41 yo, 4 children).\nIn addition to influences from family and community, the influence of resources and conflicting information was also frequently talked about (3.3 Mixed messages and urban myths):\n\u201cAnd on the one hand, everything\u2019s saying screen time\u2019s not great for kids, that it\u2019s dangerous, there\u2019s all this content. But on the other hand, schools are saying, \u2018You must do it this way\u2019. It doesn\u2019t seem to fit together.\u201d (Mother of a 4-yo, 40 yo, 2 children)\nParents reported that the different viewpoints and arguments around benefits and risks of mobile screens, the uncertainties, the rigidity around health messaging on screen time (disregarding certain nuances) seemed confusing. It led some parents to take an unbalanced (i.e., either too strict or too relaxed) outlook on providing mobile screens to young children. They mention that this has resulted a wide spectrum of views within the parent community:\n\u201cSo, I think many parents are looking towards those guidelines on how much screen time you should be doing \u2026 some other people probably totally ignore that and just do whatever they want to do. .. it\u2019s quite variable really from what I\u2019ve seen with other parents.\u201d (Mother of a 4-yo, 36 yo, 3 children)\nTheme 4: Perceived behavioural self\u2011efficacy: Managing and\u00a0achieving a\u00a0balance Parents\u2019 perceived self-efficacy or confidence in their own decision-making to provide and appropriately manage the use of mobile screens further influenced their motives to provide or not provide a device. Most parents detailed various ways in which they ensured that they have some level of control over giving a device to their child and the use that followed (4.1 Internal and external locus of control). There were two main ways parents attributed control; (a) internal\u2014actively or directly assuming control themselves (e.g., setting limits or parental controls); or (b) external\u2014attributing control to indirect or external factors (e.g., letting the device run out of charge, hiding devices). When discussing their perceived self-efficacy, parents commonly used phrases such as \u201cstrict boundaries\u201d (Mother of a 3-yo, 36 yo, one child), \u201cresisting the requests\u201d (Mother of a 4-yo, 33 yo, 2 children) or \u201crules and limits\u201d to discuss an internal locus of control:\n\u201c\u2026 me and my husband we\u2019ve got pass codes on our phone so they can\u2019t access them without that. At the moment the wi-fi is also disconnected ..\u201d (Mother of a 4-yo, 45 yo, 3 children)\nMeanwhile phrases including \u201cout of sight, out of mind\u201d (Mother of a 4-yo, 40 yo, 2 children), \u201coh it\u2019s broken\u201d (Mother of a 4-yo, 37 yo, 2 children) or \u201cthe battery is dead/ flat\u201d described screen time management strategies which relied on an external locus of control:\n\u201c.. I let it almost run out and I don\u2019t charge it. .. if her battery runs out because she\u2019s only had 20 per cent and that\u2019s all I\u2019ve bothered to charge it, .., \u201coh, sorry, Darling, there\u2019s no more iPad.\u201d (Mother of a 3-yo, 36 yo, one child)\nMany parents conceded that their own screen use and modelling plays a big role in their child\u2019s usage habits and device-related requests, and that it is important to be mindful of role-modelling. Many parents stated that their awareness of their own problematic screen time habits sometimes led them to be stricter with their child\u2019s device use (4.2 \u2018I feel like a hypocrite\u2019):\n\u201cI know how addictive screens can be and that\u2019s one of the reasons I don\u2019t want my kids started.\u201d (Mother of a 4-yo, 39 yo, 2 children)\nThey used phrases such as \u201cdouble-standard\u201d (Mother of a 1-yo, 44 yo, one child) and \u201cdo as I say, not as I do\u201d (Mother of a 3-yo, 31 yo, 2 children) to highlight the hypocrisy of resisting screen time requests from their child despite feeling that their own screen use is somewhat questionable.\nTheme 5: Perceived barriers: External challenges Parents discussed several perceived external barriers to appropriately providing a device and effectively managing healthy mobile screen habits. The most noteworthy barrier was simply the reality of life (5.1 Ideal meets reality). For most parents, life was busy and messy, and similar to things such as their child\u2019s eating and sleeping routines, screen time was another part of parenting that did not go the way they thought it would. Parents reported that screen time was \u201cgetting in the way\u201d of them being they type of parent they had thought that they would be or was making them \u201cfall short of the ideal\u201d (Father of a 4-yo, 29 yo, 2 children). There was often acceptance of this reality, where what they imagined to be ideal or perfect parenting in relation to their child\u2019s mobile screen use was in fact, quite different in truth. What comprised the ideal varied among parents, however many mentioned that while zero screen time would be ideal, it was also impossible. Some parents disagreed with the notion of ideal and thought it would largely depend on the family context and circumstances. Interestingly, some parents noted how their perceptions of ideal drastically changed following the birth of their child:\n\u201c..before you have children where you go, \u201cOh no, I\u2019m not going to let my children play on screens and have access to my phone. Then you get there\u2026, \u201cHoly crap, giving him my phone for five minutes while I am at the doctor\u2019s appointment so he\u2019s quiet and not screaming in my face is actually really handy.\u201d .. going through it has definitely changed my idea of what is okay and what is realistic\u201d (Mother of a 2-yo, 32 yo, 2 children)\nMany parents expressed their unease around the predicament of considering the costs versus benefits to their own wellbeing of providing a device (5.2 A terrible tradeoff). While the device was a helpful and convenient way to alleviate the burden or exhaustion of parenting, the trade-off was that they felt guilty that their child often used the device for much longer than they would prefer. However, some claimed that if the perceived behavioural and developmental costs of prolonged use meant that they did not provide their child with a device, it often affected their ability to \u201cjust get through the day\u201d (Mother of a 2-yo, 38 yo, one child). Another factor which contributed to this dilemma was the pervasive nature of mobile screens across families, and how wide-spread and \u201cmainstream\u201d it is (5.3 Holding back the tide). Some parents commented on how effortful it is to be the minority and to not \u201csuccumb to the majority\u201d (Mother of a 4-yo, 40 yo, one child):\n\u201c.. it\u2019s really hard for parents to be able to make an\ninformed choice\u2026a lot of the choice is taken away by the fact that it\u2019s so mainstream now.\u201d (Mother of a 4-yo, 33 yo, 2 children)\nIncompatibilities in views within family members and varying family circumstances (e.g., multiple children, urban -versus regional living) were also often apparent barriers to assertive decision-making and management of young children\u2019s mobile screen use (5.4 Family matters):\n\u201c.. if we had another child or something like that, and I was trying to look after a baby and feed a baby and change nappies \u2026, I suspect I\u2019d probably be using it a little bit more. And it really annoys me when my husband is checking his phone, and I feel like saying to him, \"You\u2019re not hearing a word I\u2019m saying\", but then he would say the same thing about me.\u201d(Mother of a 2-yo, 38 yo, one child)\nNevertheless, some parents also felt very supported within their families through regular conversations and \u201cbeing on the same page\u201d (Mother of a 1-yo, 29 yo, one child):\n\u201cI just get that mum rage big time, so it does affect me. But my husband\u2019s very supportive. We have a plan. We assume it will get better before we do it... just try and debrief through.\u201d (Mother of a 4-yo, 33 yo, one child)"

            "text": "Our study aimed to qualitatively explore the factors that underpin parents\u2019 motives for provision of smartphones and tablets to toddlers and pre-schoolers through the lens of the Theory of Planned Behaviour. There are several interesting findings that may help to inform current screen time parenting practices and guide future research. First, we found that a spectrum of attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control underpin the varied motives of parents for providing or not providing mobile screen devices to young children in their everyday lives. The inter-related nature of the themes gives a clear picture of the factors that drive parent decision-making and is consistent with the general structure and mechanisms described by the TPB [33]. Second, in addition to the conventional TPB processes, a bi-directional relationship between attitudes and perceived behavioural control seemed to be instrumental in determining parents\u2019 motives and behaviour towards mobile screens in early childhood, one which appeared to be substantially influenced by subjective norms. Parents described a sense of incongruence that they associated with over-bearing subjective norms suppressing their own attitudes and perceived behavioural\ncontrol with respect to managing screen use. The collective effect of these interactions resembled cognitive dissonance, whereby parents were realigning their attitudes with their actual behaviours rather than aligning their behaviours with existing attitudes. Third, the qualitative insights suggest that many parents\u2019 views and experiences are dependent on household composition variables (e.g., multiple children) and their socio-economic circumstances (e.g., urban or regional location, employment, familial support). Finally, the context-dependency of parental decision-making, along with individual differences in beliefs and attitudes is likely to reduce the effectiveness of universal and rigid health messaging around early childhood screen time guidelines.\nWhile there has been relatively limited qualitative work in parental decision making relating to screen time, the findings of the present study offer rich and in-depth insights into the quantitative research that examine factors underpinning parent decision making in relation to early childhood screen use. For instance, the present findings align well with past studies (e.g., 24, 36) in which a large proportion of variance (38 \u2013 50%) in the screen time decision-making of parents of young children was explained by the TPB psychosocial factors. Further, the power and heavy influence of parental attitudes in child use of mobile screens [48] and total screen time [13, 20], have been consistently demonstrated in previous early childhood screen use research. As this field of work is often characterised by polarised debate and narrative [49], qualitative research is especially important to provide context and a human voice to the factors which underpin parental views and perceptions.\nParents\u2019 attitudes about mobile screens ranged from positive views about the convenience, pragmatism and usefulness as a teaching tool, to negative views relating to potential overstimulation, displacement of developmentally healthy activities, social interactions and hinderance of creativity among children. These attitudes are consistent with qualitative research on use in early childhood [30], as well as middle-childhood [50], where parents reported feeling tension between the benefits and harms of mobile devices to children\u2019s development. In our study, parents appeared to experience varying degrees of incongruence when their attitudes towards how they planned to manage screen time conflicted with their perceived self-efficacy to do so. Parents\u2019 subjective norms (comprising the influence of family, society, and information) appeared to suppress, or possibly negate, the influence of their own attitudes on their level of device-related perceived behavioural control (including their self-efficacy). For instance, parental self-efficacy with respect to device provision was largely affected by the burdens of parenting and the reality of life. The perceived barriers made it very\nchallenging for parents to do what they believe is ideal and to hold back the tide in terms of managing when and where they would permit access to a device. These decisions elicited tensions and dilemmas for parents as they weighed the costs and benefits to their child and to their own wellbeing. The challenges of experiencing such cognitive conflict have been consistently illustrated in previous qualitative research on parental perceptions around use in early [30, 51, 52] and middle childhood, as well as adolescence [53]. As a result, differing levels of cognitive dissonance were evident among parents, which subsequently led them to realign their attitudes and beliefs with their perceived behavioural control and behaviours, in order to reduce the discomfort and tension they felt. For instance, they would rationalize their behaviour as \u2018being pretty standard\u2019 or as \u2018what the majority does\u2019.\nIn addition to the \u2018at home\u2019 pressure and dilemmas parents face in everyday device-related decision-making, perceived subjective norms also seemed to evoke a great deal of negative emotions and self-evaluations among parents. For instance, high internalised guilt, fear, worry and regrets stemming from the pressure and judgment from family and society underpinned screen-related parenting practices that were aimed at managing young children to make others feel comfortable. These perceived pressures, parental guilt and anxiety are particularly in congruence with qualitative evidence in recent studies where parents report feeling overwhelmed as they navigate the societal, social and individual expectations around managing screen time [49, 52]. In the present study, parents commonly reported the paradoxical nature of the social expectations that drove their decision-making in public places. On one hand, parents felt pressure to keep their child relatively quiet and \u2018under control\u2019 in social settings, but on the other hand felt judged by others for achieving the goal of a quiet child via the use of a screen. The conflicting social expectations and fear of negative evaluations by others (known and unknown) may have a direct impact on perceived behavioural control for parents. Not knowing which course of action is the \u2018right\u2019 one could significantly reduce parenting selfefficacy and sense of control.\nIt is especially important to view the results of the present study in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic very likely influenced perspectives on the role of technology in everyday lives of young children. For instance, COVID-19 lockdowns and online learning from home have warranted being technologically active to engage and complete any form of learning for children. Over time, these changes have contributed to the normalizing of use of screen-based devices as educational tools for young children, with growing acceptance of their role in learning [54]. This is evident through the\nincreased rates of screen use among families with young children across the world [6], including Australia, [55] since the commencement of the pandemic.\nOur findings have implications for the development of early childhood screen time guidelines. The themes that reflect parental difficulties and cognitive dilemmas with respect to managing screen time decisionmaking can be used as a starting point for developing more family-friendly and realistic screen time guidelines. Parental and social attitudes, social norms and parental self-efficacy with respect to behavioural control are all potential areas for healthy screen time intervention. Rather than largely unrealistic and dispiriting screen time guidelines, parents and caregivers would benefit from practical, consistent and positive support mechanisms. We propose several changes that may help to achieve that aim. First, parents require more flexible and feasible solutions to help reduce their perceived lack of alternatives to mobile screens in various stressful or busy scenarios. As a starting point, we suggest encouraging more no-tech alternatives (e.g., arts and crafts; photo albums) or low-tech alternatives (e.g., audiobooks or podcasts), along with ways to support parents to know how to promote more intentional technology use at home (e.g., mindfulness about the content and duration). Second, it is important to move beyond the dichotomous \u2018good or bad\u2019 argument of technology use in early childhood when engaging with parents regarding screen time. Instead, parents need to be empowered to raise digitally healthy children, and to do so will require effective resources that help them decide what is \u2018good use\u2019 and \u2018good content\u2019. Platforms such as Common Sense Media already offer resources aiding decision-making with age-appropriate content, however parents only benefit from these resources if they go looking for, and happen to find, appropriate online resources. A more visible public health program for parents may help to increase awareness of such support platforms. Third, health messaging should attempt to debunk myths which often result in parent misperceptions, such as the idea that children would fall behind in school if technology is not introduced as early as possible. Many parent attitudes and behaviours with respect to mobile screens appear to be driven by emotions, typically fear and guilt. By actively dispelling various kinds of screen time myths, parents may have a better chance of making positive, healthy decisions rather than fear-based ones.\nWhile the present study gave voice to parents and provided detailed parenting-screen time insights, some limitations must be acknowledged. First, the nature of the topic (parenting and screen time) may have led parents that were confident in their decisions to volunteer\nfor participation in the larger longitudinal study, while parents who felt their screen time-parenting was, in their own estimation, poor, may have avoided participating for fear of judgment. While the research team were extremely careful to avoid any language that could potentially be perceived as judgmental, we accept that parenting is a difficult subject and that some parents may have elected to not participate for this reason. The method of data collection (i.e., online via Zoom) may have also resulted in parents who are more confident with their use of online media to opt in for the interviews. This implies a certain closeness of the participants to digital media and devices, which in turn may be influencing their attitudes towards their children using mobile-screen devices. Second, parent gender, ethnicity, residential location and socio-economic status (SES) were not uniformly distributed across the sample despite the use of a sampling matrix. The non-uniformity may have affected the transferability of the results to diverse families across Australia (e.g., first nation families, parents of a child with a disability, remote or rural families). Given that demographic characteristics such as the SES have been shown to be associated with young children\u2019s screen time (e.g., [56, 57]), demographic factors are likely to also influence parents\u2019 attitudes and perceived behavioural control, which warrants further investigation."

            "text": "The current study investigated parental decision-making related to use of mobile screens in early childhood using the Theory of Planned Behaviour framework. Attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control collectively explained parent motives for providing mobile screens to young children. Further, varying levels of attitude-behavioural incongruence and cognitive dissonance were experienced by parents when decision-making, possibly due to the dominating influence of subjective norms. The increased acceptance of the pervasiveness of mobile technology in the post-COVID era is a prominent change among families. Future research could further explore how family practices have changed as a result of increased pandemic-related screen use and whether or not there has been any impact on child developmental outcomes over time. Parents\u2019 experience of cognitive dissonance and associated emotions also present avenues for future research, particularly with respect to targets for interventions aimed at supporting and empowering parents to raise their children to be healthy digital citizens. Most importantly, we acknowledge the need for more tailored resources offering no- and low-technological\nalternatives and practical health messaging for parents addressing provision of mobile screen devices in early childhood. Finally, we encourage public health policy makers to engage in co-design approaches with parents in order to formulate more realistic and user-friendly parenting resources.\nAbbreviations TPB: Theory of Planned Behaviour; SES: Socio\u2011economic status.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1186/ s12889\u2011 022\u2011 14459\u20110.\nAdditional file\u00a01.\nAdditional file\u00a02.\nAdditional file\u00a03.\nAcknowledgements We thank the participants of the study for their time and insights, without which this study would not have been possible.\nAuthors\u2019 contributions SM conceptualized the study, methodology, conducted the data collection and analysis, and wrote the initial draft.
