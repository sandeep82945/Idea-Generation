            "text": "In coordination chemistry, it is frequently assumed that the interaction between a metal centre and an ammonia ligand is characterised exclusively by \u03c3 character and thus that any \u03c0 character is negligible.1\u201312 This can be rationalized in an orbital picture: ammonia does not have any molecular orbitals of \u03c0 character; only the \u03c3/\u03c3* molecular orbitals of the N\u2013H bonds are partly oriented such that the metal-ammonia binding axis can lie in the nodal plane of a metal d orbital. Ammonia is therefore commonly classified as a \u03c3-only ligand.\nMetal\u2013ligand interactions can be evaluated with ligand field theory. Besides global ligand field descriptors like the ligand field splitting \u0394 or Racah parameters, the Angular Overlap Model (AOM) provides a ligand-specific parameterisation that conforms to the familiar interpretation of chemistry in terms of functional groups. The AOM quantifies the metal\u2013 ligand interaction via \u03c3 and \u03c0 overlaps, with an additional parameter for d\u2013s mixing.2,13,14 The destabilisation of each pure metal d orbital with respect to the situation in the free ion is associated with a spherical component E and a directional component that is expressed with a specific number and magnitude of e\u03c3 and e\u03c0 parameters depending on the coordination environment, see Fig. 1. The orbital splitting of\ntetrahedral and octahedral coordination spheres does not allow for a distinction between e\u03c3 and e\u03c0.\n15 This means that neglecting e\u03c0 comes with the convenience of having an unambiguous relationship between e\u03c3 and \u0394. Lower symmetry coordination environments result in fewer orbital degeneracies which should provide a sufficient number of states to fit e\u03c3 and e\u03c0 parameters simultaneously.\nWe recently developed an AOM parameter fitting procedure16 based on ab initio ligand field theory17\u201319 as a tool that provides insights into metal\u2013ligand bonding situations. Notably, it is able to obtain AOM parameters for complexes for which previously the ligand field equation system would have been underdetermined. We showed that the method yields qualitatively correct parameters and reproduces expected chemical trends like the e\u03bb values of halide ligands being associated with their donor capacity and position in the spectrochemical series.16\nIn this paper, we present some incentives to rethink the assumption of amines being \u03c3-only ligands. Firstly, we revisit the experimental UV-vis spectra of a square planar copper tetrammine and a pyramidal copper pentammine complex. They had been interpreted to not contain d\u2013d transitions that would be expected if \u03c0 interactions were present.5 Their analysis with ab initio ligand field theory calculations demonstrates the need for an ammine \u03c0 interaction. Building on this, we present and discuss AOM parameters for a series of octahedral and tetrahedral ammine complexes obtained with our recently presented AOM parameter fitting procedure.16 We find that ammonia should be viewed as capable of significant \u03c0 inter\u2020Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available.

Geometries were optimized using the unrestricted Kohn\u2013Sham formalism with the BP86 functional,22,23 the def2-SVP basis set,24 and the def2/J auxiliary basis.25 The resolution of identity approximation for the Coulomb term was used.26,27 Convergence criteria were NormalSCF for all self-consistent field calculations and TightOpt for geometry optimizations. The geometry optimizations employed the default integration grid (Accuracy 2: Lebedev 110 points) for optimization steps and the final SCF at the optimized geometry (Accuracy 4: Lebedev 302 points). Geometry optimizations of halide complexes of the type [MX6]\n3\u2212/4\u2212 with large negative charges additionally employed the CPCM/SMD solvation model with the parameters of water and an increased solvent radius of 3.0 \u00c5 to aid convergence.28,29\nFor square planar [Cu(NH3)4] 2+ and square pyramidal [Cu (NH3)5] 2+, the heavy atom positions were taken from the crystal structures (ICSD entries 14372 and 201229) and only the hydrogen atom positions were optimised with the settings stated above, but without employing a solvent model. The electronic states corresponding to the d orbitals were calculated using CASSCF30,31 in the ab initio ligand field theory\nvariant17\u201319 with the def2-TZVP basis set. The calculations on [Cu(NH3)4] 2+ and [Cu(NH3)5] 2+ also employed a subsequent perturbation theory treatment (NEVPT2).32\u201335 The active space was chosen to contain the five valence d orbitals and n d electrons, or in shorthand notation a CAS(n,5) space. The ab initio ligand field theory module17 was employed to construct the effective ligand field Hamiltonian from the calculated states. For selected examples, spin\u2013orbit coupling was considered using the spin\u2013orbit mean field approach as implemented in ORCA.36\nThe AOM was used to fit the one-electron part of the ligand field Hamiltonian13,37 according to our fitting procedure.16 The ligand field matrix contains up to 15 unique equations, which quickly results in underdetermined problems. For instance for six-coordinate complexes, one needs to fit 13 parameters of the ligand field potential: E, six e\u03c3 and six e\u03c0. Such a fit is in theory possible but in practice, linear dependencies can occur in the equation system so that the actual number of equations can be lower than 13, resulting in an underdetermined problem.\nWe address this restriction by grouping chemically equivalent ligands at similar bond lengths (e.g. in Jahn\u2013Teller distorted [Mn(NH3)6]\n3+, ligands are grouped into axial and equatorial parameter sets). In practice, grouping is achieved by adding additional equations to the system that require 0 = e\u03c3,L \u2212 e\u03c3,L\u2032. From a formal perspective, one could use these equations to require parameters to be strictly equal and thereby reduce their number. For solving the least squares problem of the overdetermined system, the addition of more equations has different consequences than the reduction of the number of parameters. Additional equations allow the\nFig. 1 Comparison of d orbital energy splittings for a free ion, a spherical potential and different coordination environments with the respective AOM parameters e\u03bb.

For an elongated octahedron and a square pyramid, the ligands on the z-axis have parameters labelled ax, while the others in the xy-plane are labelled eq. For symmetries with at least one d orbital in the totally symmetric representation, d\u2013s mixing must be considered which affects the orbital energy by an additional parameter eds.

The [Cu II(NH3)5] 2+ subunit in K[Cu(NH3)5][PF6]3 38 and NH4[Cu(NH3)5][PF6]3\n39 is approximately square pyramidal (point group: C2v) and thus represents a suitable test case. Another convenient feature is its d9 electronic configuration that results in four d\u2013d transitions. The interelectronic repulsion within each electronic state is equal, and therefore the energy differences of these states can be equated with the energy differences of the d orbitals.\nThe electronic spectrum of [Cu(NH3)5] 2+ (see Fig. 2a) shows a band at 15 300 cm\u22121 with a weak shoulder at 14 000 cm\u22121\nand a second band at 11 000 cm\u22121, see Table 1. The shoulder is assigned to a dxy \u2192 dx2\u2212y2 transition by Duggan et al., 38 implying a state splitting of 1300 cm\u22121. Within the AOM, this splitting results in an e\u03c0 value of 1300 cm\n\u22121 in a perfect square pyramid or even a slightly larger value in a C2v distorted square pyramid (see ESI\u2020 for details). Since the shoulder is not a very pronounced feature, the signal was interpreted later as \u201cessentially unsplit\u201d, ruling out a \u03c0 interaction.5 With this interpretation, ammonia is viewed as a \u03c3-only ligand. This assumption was also made for other complexes.6\u201312,40\nCASSCF/NEVPT2 calculations on the [Cu(NH3)5] 2+ subunit from the crystal structure yield an orbital ordering and d\u2013d transitions in very good agreement with the measured ones, see Table 1. We note that while spin\u2013orbit coupling (SOC) may be of importance for copper complexes (single-electron SOC parameter of ca. 830 cm\u22121 for free Cu2+),15 inclusion of SOC does not qualitatively alter the picture, see ESI.\u2020 The calculations thus fully support the spectral assignments of Duggan et al., and hence the need for an ammonia \u03c0 interaction of about 1300 cm\u22121.\nSquare planar copper tetrammine\nAs a second example, we selected the [CuII(NH3)4] 2+ subunit in the crystal structure of Na4[Cu II(NH3)4][Cu I(S2O3)2]2. 42 While initially, the crystal structure was thought to contain copper ions in a square-planar environment,42 later studies suggested that one or two axial ammonia ligands may weakly coordinate.43 Although the precise structure is therefore not clear, there are two independently reported UV-vis spectra.41,44 Tomlinson et al. assigned the d\u2013d transitions for the presumed square-planer complex using polarised electronic spectra, see Fig. 2b, leading to a one-electron orbital sequence of dx2\u2212y2 > dz2 > dxy \u2265 dxz,dyz.41\nTo evaluate the electronic structure with CASSCF/NEVPT2 calculations as for the square-pyramidal system, hydrogen atoms were added to complete the ammonia ligands of the [Cu(NH3)4]\n2+ subunit and their positions were optimized (see computational details). The influence of one or two axial ammonia ligands was evaluated explicitly, see below. Using CASSCF calculations that facilitate a direct assignment of configurations to states, we arrive at a different energetic ordering for the square planar complex, namely dx2\u2212y2 > dxy > dxz, dyz \u2248 dz2 in agreement with other computational studies.\n45\u201347 Giner et al. found this orbital ordering, notably including the pronounced energy difference between the dxy and dxz, dyz levels, at different levels of theory that capture electron correlation\nFig. 2 Electronic spectrum of (a) NH4[Cu(NH3)5][PF6]3, reprint from ref. 38 with permission from the Royal Society of Chemistry.

These additional molecules would result in axial Cu\u2013N distances of 2.88 \u00c5. We investigated these different possibilities with one or two ammonia ligands approaching the copper ion along the z-axis, see Fig. 3. In these scans, the position of the dxy orbital is taken as the reference value for the d orbital energies. As expected, the energy difference dxy \u2192 dx2\u2212y2 remains constant to a good approximation, and the position of the dz2 orbital is influenced significantly by the additional ligands on the z-axis. The energies of the dxz and dyz orbitals are lower in energy than the dxy orbital. In the extreme case of a square planar [Cu(NH3)4]\n2+ (Fig. 3, middle panel), the dz2 orbital is found coincidentally at about the same energy as the dxz and dyz orbitals. Here, too, SOC does not qualitatively alter the picture, see ESI.\u2020 Tomlinson et al. probably investigated a mixture of structures, leading to the large line broadening of the lower intensity peak.41 It is not possible to determine a dominant composition with the present data.\nWith regard to a possible ammonia \u03c0 interaction, the ligand field splitting of the square planar complex can be discussed as follows. If there was no \u03c0 interaction at all, the dxy(b2g) and dxz/yz(eg) orbital energies \u03b5 would be degenerate (see also ESI, Fig. 3\u2020):\n\u03b5dxz \u00bc \u03b5dyz \u00bc 2e\u03c0 \u00bc 0\n\u03b5dxy \u00bc 4e\u03c0 \u00bc 0 The dz2 orbital energy depends on the extent of d\u2013s mixing, and thus could be lower or roughly equal to the energy of the aforementioned orbitals. If there is a donating \u03c0 interaction, the dxz and dyz orbitals are shifted up by 2e\u03c0 and the dxy orbital is shifted up by 4e\u03c0. Indeed, the CASSCF calculation shows that the energy of the dxy orbital is significantly higher than that of the dyz and dxz orbitals, while the energy of the dz2 orbital is accidentally equal to the ones of the dyz and dxz orbitals. A similar orbital energy sequence (dx2\u2212y2 \u226b dxy > dz2 > dxz, dyz) was assigned to the D4h [Cu(H2O)4]\n2+ subunits in meta-zeunerite (Cu(UO2)2(AsO4)2\u00b78H2O) by Billing et al.\n49 For this system, a significant \u03c0 interaction from the equatorial water ligands was expected.49 Ten years later, this sequence was still considered to be plausible only for strong \u03c0 donors.50\nThe energy difference between dxy and dyz,dxz from the CASSCF calculation is independent of any specific AOM fitting routine and too large to be a computational artefact. Increasing the basis set size does not lead to a qualitatively different result, see ESI.\u2020 Additionally, the computational studies mentioned above45\u201348 find the same pronounced difference between the dxy and dxz, dyz orbital energies using different levels of theory. In the AOM, the higher energy of the dxy orbital can only be explained if e\u03c0 > 0. Therefore, we interpret this ligand field splitting as strong support for the existence of a \u03c0 interaction for ammonia ligands."

Using our ab initio AOM sampling procedure, we evaluated a series of octahedral and tetrahedral complexes where all orbital energies affected by \u03c0 interactions are degenerate so that the ammonia \u03c0 interactions cannot be isolated. To this end, we chose complexes of the type [M(NH3)6]\nn+, with M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Ru, Os and n = 2, 3. We note that some of the structures are Jahn\u2013Teller distorted and therefore have different axial and equatorial AOM parameters. For strongly distorted structures, the ligands were grouped such that those at similar bond lengths are set to have equal parameters.\nThe average ab initio AOM parameters based on CASSCF calculations are listed in Table 2 for selected equilibrium structures. Note that the standard deviations result from the data points of five distinct calculations at similar structures. While the CASSCF calculation itself may carry a systematic error that could not be avoided even with a larger number of samples, the order of magnitude was shown to be reliable.16,18,51,52\nThe ab initio AOM parameters identified with this procedure show a substantial \u03c0 interaction for all complexes studied here. The data set is consistent with expectations and follows common trends, such as larger parameter values for higher oxidation states. Our findings for this more generalised data set thus contradict the widespread assumption of ammonia having only \u03c3 interactions."

            "text": "To rule out any conceivable sources of error for the chemically relevant magnitude of the ammonia \u03c0 interactions we have identified above, we expanded the data set to tetrahedral complexes. This tests the possibility that artefacts arise due to the overlap of two adjacent \u03c3 potentials in an octahedral, squareplanar or other setting with closely spaced ligands. This overlap would occur at a position which would be covered by a \u03c0 parameter. In such cases, both \u03c3 and \u03c0 would be artificially increased, while the spherical contribution E would be decreased correspondingly. Therefore, it should be tested whether ammonia \u03c0 parameters also appear in complexes where the ligands are spaced further apart and thus overlapping \u03c3 potentials can be ruled out.\nWe chose complexes of the type [M(NH3)4] 2+/3+ with M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni. These complexes are hypothetical; their only purpose is to provide more room for the ligands. The fits yield ab initio AOM parameters that are even larger than the ones obtained for the octahedral complexes, even though some scattering is observed. We note that d\u2013s mixing needed to be included for some of the complexes where structural deviations from ideal tetrahedral symmetry were apparent (see ESI\u2020). In conclusion, overlapping \u03c3 potentials can be ruled out as the origin for the observed ammonia \u03c0 interaction in both the octahedral and tetrahedral complexes.\nScan and comparison to halido complexes\nIn order to verify that the order of magnitude obtained for the ammonia \u03c0 parameters is reasonable, we replaced the ammonia ligands in [Cr(NH3)6]\n3+ with chloride ligands in exactly the same positions. Since it is widely accepted that halides and metals interact via a considerable \u03c0 path, this data set allows a meaningful comparison with the metal\u2013ammine parameters.\nIndeed, the chloride ligands show e\u03c0 values that are even smaller than those of the ammonia ligands (e\u03c0 chloride: 313 (524) cm\u22121, e\u03c0 ammonia: 1027(255) cm\n\u22121). However, the M\u2013 NH3 bonds in these complexes are much shorter than M\u2013Cl bonds would be in fully relaxed complexes. For instance, the Co\u2013NH3 bond length in [Co(NH3)6]Cl2 is 2.11 \u00c5,\n53 whereas the Co\u2013Cl bond length in CoCl2 is 2.51 \u00c5.\n54 The metal\u2013chloride distance when placing the chloride ions at the nitrogen atom positions of the relaxed [Cr(NH3)6]\n3+ complexes is thus unnaturally short, which presumably leads to the broad scattering of the parameters and the unexpectedly small e\u03c0 parameters. We observed this behaviour already in our previous study on tetrahedral halido metalates, where e\u03c0 decreases at shorter bond lengths.16 Calculations on relaxed [MCl6]\n3\u2212/4\u2212 complexes yield bond lengths in the range of 2.43 \u00c5 to 2.53 \u00c5 and e\u03c0 parameters around 500 cm\u22121 with significantly less scatter (see ESI\u2020). Scanning the metal\u2013ligand distances in these examples from the equilibrium bond length of Cr\u2013NH3 to that of Cr\u2013Cl, see Fig. 4, shows the similar order of magnitude for the e\u03c0 parameters in these two scenarios.

            "text": "To better understand the origin of the \u03c0 interaction of ammonia, we studied the influence of the substituent R in \u2013NR3 on the \u03c0 interaction, specifically comparing \u2013NH3 and \u2013NMe3. Complexes with different amine ligands can be compared in terms of their ligand field splitting or via AOM parameterization. A problem arising for such comparisons is that the bond lengths vary and hence the observed splitting is\ninfluenced by the bond length and the ligand field strength of the amine itself. While these effects cannot be disentangled fully in experimental data, it appears that the bond length is the more dominant factor in a study by Lever et al.4\nDue to the bulkiness of the methylamine ligand, it is not possible to obtain reasonable structures for [M(NMe3)6]\nn+ complexes. Therefore, we chose to study heteroleptic complexes of the type [M(NH3)4(NMe3)2]\nn+, with the methylamine ligands positioned trans to each other, see Table 3. For all complexes, the e\u03c3 parameters of the ammonia ligands are larger than those of the amine ligands, whereas the magnitudes of the e\u03c0 parameters are comparable or larger.\nTo evaluate the influence of the M\u2013N bond length on the AOM parameters, we set the M\u2013N bond lengths with ammonia ligands to the value of the M\u2013NMe3 distances. As expected, the e\u03c3 and e\u03c0 parameters of the ammonia ligands decrease so that the AOM parameters of \u2013NMe3 are consistently larger than those of \u2013NH3. In the hexammine reference complex with all ammonia ligands at the same distance as the amine ligands in the relaxed structure, the ammonia ligands have very similar AOM parameters as in the mixed complex with fixed ammonia bond lengths. We can therefore conclude that amine ligands have intrinsically higher e\u03c0 parameters than ammonia ligands. This comparison furthermore points towards hyperconjugation of the N\u2013R bonds as a possible origin of the \u03c0 interaction for both amines and ammonia.\nFrom a molecular orbital perspective, the chemical origin and a possible explanation for the considerable \u03c0 interaction of ammonia ligands may lie in the hyperconjugation of the N\u2013 H bonds with the respective d orbitals. Hyperconjugation was already observed and interpreted by Mulliken55\u201357 and became an important tool for rationalizing formation and stabilization energies58 and chemical shifts in NMR experiments.59\nFig. 4 Bond length scans of [Cr(NH3)6] 3+ and [CrCl6] 3\u2212 from the optimized metal\u2013ligand bond length of the ammine complex to that of the chloride complex.

This interaction is explained by hyperconjugation of the N\u2013H bonding orbital with the ruthenium d orbital.60\u201362\nAn alternative view is offered by the interpretation of ligand field splittings in terms of electrostatic potentials as developed by Gerloch and Woolley.63\u201365 This picture is completely independent of molecular orbital theory and treats the influence of the ligands on the d orbital energies purely electrostatically. With this approach, the \u03c0 interaction could be explained by the electron density of the N\u2013H bond and the negative partial charge on the nitrogen atom exerting an influence on the metal d orbital energies.\nBoth interpretations are supported by the results for the methylamine complexes. The larger N\u2013C bonding orbital of \u2013NMe3 compared to the N\u2013H bonding orbitals of \u2013NH3 suggest a stronger hyperconjugation with the metal d orbitals. Likewise, the methyl groups are electron donating, leaving a higher electron density at the nitrogen and thus supporting the picture of an electrostatic ligand field interaction."

            "text": "When applying the aiLFT procedure on ethylenediamine (en) and diethylenetriamine (dien), it is apparent that it is not possible to obtain a good fit to the d orbital energies with just e\u03c3 and e\u03c0. We attribute this to an effect called \u201cmisdirected valency\u201d by Deeth et al.48,66\u201369 Misdirected valency is caused by bent bonding and non-bonding lone pairs where the centroid of the bond is not aligned with the metal\u2013ligand axis, as depicted in ref. 66. For the chelating en and dien ligands, the M\u2013N bond is bent because of the orientation of the carbon backbone. We note that methylamine, although not chelating, also shows slight off-axis bonding since the bulky \u2013CH3 groups prevent full alignment. The parameters found for chelating amines (shown in the ESI\u2020) should therefore be interpreted with some caution.\nIf the metal\u2013ligand interaction is asymmetric with respect to the bonding axis, it cannot be fully described by the set of parameters employed. It is in principle possible to include offdiagonal e\u03c3\u03c0 parameters in the AOM parameterisation. 48 Naturally, this would aggravate the underdetermination problem and hinder a clear interpretation of the results."

Our findings question the reliability of published AOM parameters for ammonia complexes from previous fitting procedures applied to experimental and computational data where e\u03c0 was neglected, noting of course that this was often done to reduce the number of AOM parameters. Without this assumption, many cases would not have been solvable. Our\nwork furthermore raises the question whether any ligand can be considered a \u03c3-only ligand."
