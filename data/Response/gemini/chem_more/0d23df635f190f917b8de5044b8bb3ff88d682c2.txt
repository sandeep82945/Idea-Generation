1. **Investigate the in vitro and in vivo antiviral activity of Promacta and tucatinib against influenza A (H7N9) virus.** This would involve testing the compounds in cell culture and animal models to determine their ability to inhibit viral replication and protect against infection.
2. **Determine the mechanism of action of Promacta and tucatinib against influenza A (H7N9) virus.** This could be done by studying the interactions between the compounds and the viral proteins, as well as the effects of the compounds on viral replication.
3. **Develop resistance profiles for Promacta and tucatinib against influenza A (H7N9) virus.** This would involve exposing the virus to the compounds over time and monitoring for the development of resistance mutations.
4. **Evaluate the safety and efficacy of Promacta and tucatinib in humans.** This would involve conducting clinical trials to determine the safety and effectiveness of the compounds in treating influenza A (H7N9) infection.
5. **Investigate the potential for Promacta and tucatinib to be used in combination with other antiviral drugs to treat influenza A (H7N9) infection.** This could involve testing the compounds in combination with other drugs to determine if they have synergistic or additive effects.
