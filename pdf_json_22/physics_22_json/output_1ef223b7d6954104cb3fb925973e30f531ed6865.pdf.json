    "abstractText": "The appearance of electrically neutral water molecules in the structure of cobalt dinitrate dihydrate, Co(NO3)2\u00b72H2O, drastically changes its magnetic properties as compared to its waterless counterpart, Co(NO3)2. The title compound shows Ising-like behavior reflected in its thermodynamic properties. It experiences long-range antiferromagnetic order at TN = 20.5 K and metamagnetic transition at \u03bc0HC = 0.76 T. First-principles calculations produce the values of leading exchange interactions J1 ~ 10 K and J2 ~ 0.5 K and single-ion anisotropy D ~ 1 K which allows us to consider Co(NO3)2\u00b72H2O as a quasi-two-dimensional magnetic system.",

            "text": "Magnets exhibiting field-induced transitions can be divided into highly anisotropic Ising and weakly anisotropic Heisenberg ones. Isotropic materials allow the rotation of the local moment directions perpendicular to the external magnetic field. Phase transitions in anisotropic materials are characterized by reversals of the local moment [1]. The reduction in the dimensionality of the magnetic subsystem manifests itself in different ways in isotropic and anisotropic magnets. The theoretical background of two-dimensional magnetism has been provided by the seminal research of Onsager, who predicted that a monolayer Ising magnet could transit into the long-range ordered state [2]. The essence of the Ising model is the presumption that the magnetic moment of any given atom possesses only one degree of freedom pointing either up or down along a direction dictated by single-ion anisotropy. This is in contrast with the Heisenberg model, which presumes the presence of three degrees of freedom concerning the direction of the magnetic moment. Note that the Mermin\u2013Wagner theorem [3], which postulates the absence of long-range order in isotropic two-dimensional Heisenberg systems, does not apply to the Ising ones. Despite the fundamental importance of Onsager prediction, experimental realizations of ordered two-dimensional magnets were found to be rather rare. In this respect, the discovery of intrinsic ferromagnetism in two-dimensional van der Waals crystals is of the utmost interest [4]. An overview of the progress in the field of two-dimensional magnets is given in Ref. [5]. With this work, we bring attention to the quasi-two-dimensional Ising-like system, Co(NO3)2\u00b72H2O, featuring square layers of Co2+ ions linked by the nitrate groups. The only studied compound within the TM(NO3)2\u00b72H2O family, where TM is the 3d transition metal, is nickel dinitrate dihydrate Ni(NO3)2\u00b72H2O [6].

Experimentally, we found that the value of metamagnetic phase transition, \u00b50HC = 0.76 T, can be put into correspondence with the calculated value of the single-ion anisotropy [20]:\ngS\u00b5B\u00b50HC = 2D (9)\nMaterials 2022, 15, 7066 8 of 9\nAt D = 1 K, the calculated field of metamagnetic transition is\u00b50HCcalc = 0.74 T. The mean field theory largely overestimated the Neel temperature in Co(NO3)2\u00b72H2O.\nHowever, strong spin\u2013orbital coupling in Co2+ ions allows us to consider their effective moment, Meff = 1/2. In this case, the Neel temperature estimated through the formula was appropriate for the layered magnetic systems [21].\nTN = 4\u03c0 J1M2e f f\nln(J1\u03c02/J2) (10)\nresults in TNcalc = 23.2 K, which is in good correspondence with experimentally found value TN = 20.5 K. Overall, the magnetic behavior of Co(NO3)2\u00b72H2O is influenced by the single-ion anisotropy of Co2+ ions. Besides the pronounced drop of magnetic susceptibility at T < TN, it defines the field of metamagnetic transition. At this field, the magnetic moments of Co2+ ions initially oriented antiparallel to the external magnetic field flip to the field direction."

            "text": "InCo(NO3)2\u00b72H2O, we find an example of the system evidencing Ising-like behavior. Two water molecules introduced into the crystal structure of Co(NO3)2 play the role of chemical scissors, cutting the original framework structure into layers coupled through hydrogen bonds. Properties of Co(NO3)2\u00b72H2O are in sharp contrast with those observed in waterless Co(NO3)2 [22]. The behavior of Co(NO3)2 is of the Heisenberg type, where the frustration of exchange interactions is lifted by the formation of a 120\u25e6 noncollinear structure. Usually, this is not the case for Ising antiferromagnets. In Co(NO3)2, however, the 120\u25e6 motif appears due to the mutual orientation of local easy axes in CoO6 octahedra. While the magnetic structures of both Co(NO3)2 and Co(NO3)2\u00b72H2O are not established yet experimentally, we believe that the simple collinear antiferromagnetic arrangement is realized in Co(NO3)2\u00b72H2O contrary to the exotic chiral noncoplanar ferrimagnet of the inverted umbrella type in Co(NO3)2.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ma15207066/s1, Figure S1: X-ray pattern of polycrystalline Co(NO3)\u00b72(H2O)2 sample. High background level associated with the use of X-ray amorphous adhesive tape. In addition, XRD Co-containing samples with using Cu (K\u03b1) radiation gives a large background due to secondary radiation darkening the diffraction pattern.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, O.S.V., A.N.V. and T.S.-D.; methodology, I.V.M. and A.A.V.; software, A.I. and B.R.; validation, I.V.M. and T.S.-D.; formal analysis, A.I. and I.L.D.; investigation, A.A.V., B.R. and I.L.D.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, O.S.V. and I.V.M.; writing\u2014review and editing, A.N.V. and T.S.-D.
