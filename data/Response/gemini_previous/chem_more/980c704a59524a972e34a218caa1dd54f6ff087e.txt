1. **Investigate the role of Hsp90 in the development of resistance to GBM therapy.** This could be done by studying the expression of Hsp90 in GBM cells that are resistant to chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
2. **Develop new Hsp90 inhibitors that are more potent and selective than existing inhibitors.** This could be done by screening natural product libraries or by designing new inhibitors based on the structure of existing inhibitors.
3. **Evaluate the efficacy of Hsp90 inhibitors in combination with other GBM therapies.** This could be done by studying the effects of Hsp90 inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or immunotherapy.
4. **Investigate the role of Hsp90 in neurodegeneration.** This could be done by studying the expression of Hsp90 in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases or by studying the effects of Hsp90 inhibitors on neurodegenerative processes in vitro.
5. **Develop new Hsp90 inhibitors that are neuroprotective.** This could be done by screening natural product libraries or by designing new inhibitors based on the structure of existing inhibitors.
