    "abstractText": "Photonic nanojets (PNJs) have promising applications as optical probes in super-resolution optical microscopy, Raman microscopy, as well as fluorescence microscopy. In this work, we consider optimal design of PNJs using a heterogeneous lens refractive index with a fixed lens geometry and uniform plane wave illumination. In particular, we consider the presence of manufacturing error of heterogeneous lens, and propose a computational framework of Optimization Under Uncertainty (OUU) for robust optimal design of PNJ. We formulate a risk-averse stochastic optimization problem with the objective to minimize both the mean and the variance of a target function, which is constrained by the Helmholtz equation that governs the 2D transverse electric (2D TE) electromagnetic field in a neighborhood of the lens. The design variable is taken as a spatially-varying field variable, where we use a finite element method for its discretization, impose a total variation penalty to promote its sparsity, and employ an adjoint-based BFGS method to solve the resulting high-dimensional optimization problem. We demonstrate that our proposed OUU computational framework can achieve more robust optimal design than a deterministic optimization scheme to significantly mitigate the impact of manufacturing uncertainty.",

            "text": "Photonic nanojets (PNJs) are highly focused beams of light that can arise, e.g., when a laser illuminates a micrometersized glass lens. Illuminating a nano-sample with a PNJ produces a far field that is hyper-sensitive to the presence, the properties, and the position of the sample relative to the PNJ. For example Chen et al. [2004], Li et al. [2005], placing a 3D gold nanoparticle sized 2-60 nm inside a PNJ introduces a perturbation in the backscattered far-field intensity anywhere from -35 dB to 15 dB relative to the backscattering intensity of the PNJ-producing micro-lens alone. This and other effects, like the resonant interaction of PNJs with dielectric and plasmonic nanostructures in the sample, make PNJ illumination a promising prospect for simple and inexpensive superresolution optical detection, localization, measurement, imaging, and manipulation Darafsheh [2021], Karamehmedovic\u0301 et al. [2022a].\nThere are many numerical and a few experimental works attempting PNJ design by structured illumination or by lens shaping Lecler et al. [2019], Zhu and Goddard [2016], Paganini et al. [2015]. Lens shaping optimizes the geometry of a homogeneous lens Chen et al. [2021a], Hengyu et al. [2015] for a fixed illumination and may employ additional structures such as planar supporting substrates, planar substrates with gaps, and combinations of two or more lenses. Some lens shaping studies have allowed limited heterogeneity in the lens refractive index (e.g. layered spheres) Geints et al. [2011]. So far, point-, line-, hollow-focus and multiple-foci PNJ were obtained by structured illumination of\nar X\niv :2\n20 9.\n02 45\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.C E\ndielectric microspheres, and PNJ position was designed by illuminating micro-scale dielectric spheres, hemispheres and spherical caps, dielectric elliptical particles, cylinders/disks, cuboids, core-shell spheres, core-shell cylinders and core-shell cuboids, spiral axicons, chains of metal-dielectric spheres, chains of core-shell cylinders and low-dimensional parameterized dielectric particles. Recently, Karamehmedovic\u0301 et al. [2022b] studied dynamic PNJ steering using computed structured illumination and a fixed simple homogeneous lens, while Karamehmedovic\u0301 et al. [2022a] applied this steerable optical probe in a numerical demonstration of lateral and vertical super-resolution optical imaging.\nThe PNJ design scheme we propose and study here involves a fixed-geometry heterogeneous micro-lens. Since a given desired PNJ position requires a specific and detailed optimized lens refractive index profile, it is interesting to perform uncertainty quantification of the PNJ design scheme given lens manufacturing errors and illumination imprecision. Quantifying and mitigating these uncertainties is essential to produce robust optical systems. Nevertheless, there is limited attention in the literature to the effect of these uncertainties and taking them into account in the optimization process.\nOur goal with this work is twofold. First, we devise and demonstrate numerically a systematic approach to design PNJ properties, in particular, the PNJ location and intensity. We achieve this by optimizing the heterogeneous lens profile for fixed lens geometry and fixed uniform plane wave illumination. The lens heterogeneity provides flexibility in the PNJ design, as it increases the number of degrees of freedom (DOFs) in the optimal solution. This flexibility eliminates the need for using complex lens shapes and enables achieving the design using, e.g., cylindrical and spherical lenses. Next, we quantify and mitigate the effect of possible manufacturing error using an Optimization Under Uncertainty (OUU) framework. The numerical feasibility of our approach is realized using scalable high-dimensional optimization techniques for PDE-based problems.\nWe do not expect our computed lens profiles to be experimentally realizable at the moment. Rather, our work is a numerical analysis of the effects of manufacturing and illumination uncertainties on the performance of the proposed PNJ design. In the microwave regime, however, with wavelengths of the order of 1 cm, we do expect the lens profiles to be feasible to produce.\nFig. 1 shows a conceptual illustration of the sample average approximation (SAA)-based OUU framework that we build in section 2. The framework needs as inputs a representation of the manufacturing noise and a design objective, Fig. 1 (top). The latter is normally written in terms of expected values of some stochastic objective and a regularization term. The optimization process starts with an initial design, Fig. 1, (bottom left) at which the objective and its gradient with respect to the design parameters are computed. The gradient is used to create a BFGS step to update the initial design. The framework terminates if the updated design achieves the convergence criteria, otherwise it will continue to create the next BFGS step and repeat the process."

We enforce the dependency of the scattered field on \u03c4 via constraining the optimization problem with the weak form of the system (1)\u2013(2), details of formulating the weak form for the Helmholtz equation can be found in Chen et al. [2021b].

To compute the gradient required for BFGS, we form an adjoint-based gradient Gunzburger [2002] which require M forward problem, (8), solves and M corresponding adjoint problem solves. Computing the adjoint-based gradient is scalable since the number of PDE solves required, 2M , is independent of the number of DOFs of the discretization of \u03c4 . We use the python library Stochastic Optimization under high-dimensional Uncertainty in Python (SOUPy) for the SAA based optimization Chen [2021]."

We set the simulation domain to be of 10 by 10 units and the PML layer width to be 1 unit, Fig. 4a. The incident wave in our simulation is a plane wave given by uinc(x) = exp(ik0x.b\u0302). The real part of uinc is shown in Fig. 4b.\nFor the initial homogeneous lens profile, Fig. 5a, the resulting total amplitude profile squared is shown in Fig. 5b. We note a PNJ-like formation with maximum amplitude square of about 8 units. Starting from this initial lens profile, we solve the optimization problem of minimizing the deterministic form of the objective (9) (M = 1 and \u03b6m = 0) where xPNJ = (8.5, 5) and APNJ = 20. The solution, the optimal profile, is shown in Fig. 6a. The achieved total amplitude squared field that corresponds to the optimal profile is shown in Fig. 6b. We observe that a PNJ-like formation in the desired location xPNJ is evident and that the maximum amplitude square at the peak of the PNJ formation is significantly larger than the initial amplitude, \u223c 22 units. The full width half maximum (FWHM) of the formed PNJ is about 0.54\u03bb, Fig. 6c.\nReduction of the cost and the gradient of the optimization objective using BFGS method Byrd et al. [1995] is shown in Fig. 6b. At around iteration 30, both the cost functional and the gradient norm plateau around constant values as shown\nin Fig. 7. The optimization is terminated after reaching a maximum backtracking limit of 70. The gradient is reduced, significantly, approximately two orders of magnitude. The cost functional is still relatively large after termination because attaining the desired amplitude of APNJ = 20 is not possible for the model that we specify, hence the large discrepancy between APNJ and the achieved amplitude \u223c 5."

            "text": "In this section we present two numerical experiments. In the first one, the desired location is shifted along the radius, xPNJ = (9.5, 5) and APNJ = 20. We obtain an optimal lens design, Fig. 8a, that is considerably different from the one we obtain in Fig. 6 and achieves the desired radial shift in the PNJ location. We obtain a PNJ that peaks at xPNJ = (9.5, 5), Fig. 8b.\nIn the second numerical experiment, the desired location is shifted along the angular direction, xPNJ = (8.5, 6) and APNJ = 20. In this case, the optimal lens design that we obtain, Fig. 9a, is non-symmetric and distinct from the previous lens designs. It effectively \u201cbends\u201d the light to achieve the desired PNJ that peaks at xPNJ = (8.5, 6), Fig. 9b.\nNote that the desired PNJ amplitude in the two scenarios we discuss here is \u223c 5 while APNJ = 20. To illustrate the effect of choosing the value of APNJ, we present a scenario in which 5 < APNJ < 20. We choose APNJ = 7 and keep xPNJ = (8.5, 6) unchanged. The optimization in this case fails to produce the PNJ phenomena and the intense light energy is scattered among multiple formations, Fig. 9c and 9d."

We add manufacturing error realizations, obtained from the same distribution from which the realizations\nin Fig. 3 are obtained, to the optimal lens in Fig. 9a and solve the forward problem (1) to obtain the corresponding total amplitude squared. We repeat this process for M = 15 error realizations. In Fig. 10, we show two cases of the 15 cases. The location and intensity of the result PNJ varies based on the noise realization, e.g. the PNJ in Fig. 10b is slightly different than the one in Fig. 10d. This shows that the presence of manufacturing noise of this magnitude affect the properties of the desired PNJ.\nTo summarize the variation of PNJ properties due to the M = 15 error realizations, we plot a histogram of the PNJ maximum intensity location and maximum amplitude squared, Fig. 11. We note that the maximum amplitude is attained at five different locations with varying statistical frequency, Fig. 11a. These locations are discrete because they correspond to finite element mesh vertices. The maximum total amplitude squared also varies. It attains values ranging from \u223c 20.4 to \u223c 21.5, Fig. 11b."

            "text": "Here we solve the problem of finding the optimal lens design while taking the manufacturing errors into account via using the SAA based OUU formulation as described in sections 2.4 and 2.5. We obtain an optimal lens profile, Fig. 12a, that has visibly different features form the lens profile obtained in the corresponding deterministic setup, Fig. 9. The PNJ formation in the desired location, xPNJ = (8.5, 6), is evident in the corresponding total amplitude squared profile, Fig. 12b. In this experiment, M = 15 and APNJ = 20.\nAnalogous to the deterministic case, we summarize the PNJ properties for this SAA OUU case in histograms, Fig. 13, to study the effect of the same 15 manufacturing error realizations on the produced PNJ. We see that using SAA OUU approach leads to more robust PNJ properties at the presence of manufacturing errors: For the 15 error samples, the attained PNJ locations are realized in only two points in space (compared to five points in Fig. 11a) and the attained maximum amplitudes are generally higher than those in the deterministic case (Fig. 11b).\nIn table 1a, we provide the mean and the variance for each of the three quantities, the x and y coordinates of the PNJ peak and the total amplitude square value at the peak, for both the deterministic and the SAA OUU cases. In the SAA OUU case, the variance of the PNJ location is notably smaller and the mean of the maximum amplitude is larger when compared to the deterministic case. In table 1b, we show the same quantities for a slightly different numerical experiment in which the noise amplitude is doubled. The results in this case are an evident confirmation of the advantage of using the SAA OUU formulation. The variances of the three quantities are reduced when using SAA OUU compared to the deterministic optimization, and the mean of the attained maximum amplitude is larger.\nIn Fig. 14, we compare the convergence results of the deterministic and the SAA runs. Overall, the convergence patterns are similar for the two cases. However, if we take a look at the gradient norm plot, Fig. 14 (right), we can see that the convergence of the SAA run is slightly slower compared to the deterministic run. This is expected because of the complicated SAA objective function that has M cost functions to be minimized simultaneously."

Additionally, incorporating manufacturing uncertainty in the optimization problem of the heterogeneous lens design gives a non-trivial optimal lens design that achieves robust PNJ design. Some future work will be on alternative stochastic formulation using probability or chance constraint Chen and Ghattas [2021] to control the defect rate, optimal design with design constraint to facilitate more feasible manufacturing, and experimental validation of the proposed computational results."
