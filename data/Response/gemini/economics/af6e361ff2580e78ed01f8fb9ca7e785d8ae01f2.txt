1. **Investigate the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on food choice motives.** The paper notes that it is too early to fully understand the definite food choice motive changes, and that more research is needed in three to five years when the new conditions will be clear and a number of studies will have been published. This research could build on the findings of the paper to explore how food choice motives have evolved over time and to identify any lasting changes.
2. **Examine the role of online shopping in shaping food choice motives.** The paper highlights the increase in online shopping during the pandemic and suggests that this trend is likely to continue in the future. This research could investigate how online shopping is influencing food choice motives, such as convenience, price, and nutritional quality.
3. **Explore the impact of the pandemic on food waste and environmental concerns.** The paper notes that food waste and environmental concerns are becoming increasingly important to consumers. This research could investigate how the pandemic has affected these concerns and how they are likely to shape food choice motives in the future.
4. **Investigate the relationship between food choice motives and health outcomes.** The paper discusses the impact of the pandemic on health, weight control, and mood and stress. This research could explore the relationship between food choice motives and these health outcomes, and how these relationships may have changed during the pandemic.
5. **Develop a "new" index of consumer satisfaction that reflects the changing food choice motives.** The paper suggests that defining a "new" index of consumer satisfaction is necessary to alter the sale strategies of retail managers, food companies, and other parties involved in the agri-food chain. This research could develop and validate such an index, and explore how it can be used to improve food marketing and sales strategies.
