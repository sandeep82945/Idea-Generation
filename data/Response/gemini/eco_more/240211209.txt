1. **Extending the model to consider multiple types of fraudulent activities.** The current model only considers a single type of fraudulent activity. However, in many real-world settings, there may be multiple types of fraudulent activities that occur. For example, in the context of online advertising, there may be fraudulent activities such as click fraud, ad fraud, and domain spoofing. Extending the model to consider multiple types of fraudulent activities would allow for a more comprehensive analysis of the problem.
2. **Developing more efficient algorithms for computing the optimal resource allocation strategy.** The greedy-like algorithms that we developed in this work have approximation ratio and resource augmentation guarantees. However, these algorithms may not be efficient enough for large-scale instances of the problem. Developing more efficient algorithms for computing the optimal resource allocation strategy would be a valuable contribution to the literature.
3. **Investigating the impact of different contract mechanisms.** In this work, we considered a simple contract mechanism where the principal offers a contract to the administrator that specifies a payment as a proportion of the total welfare that the administrator contributes to the system. However, there are many other types of contract mechanisms that could be used. Investigating the impact of different contract mechanisms would help to identify the most effective way to incentivize the administrator to maximize welfare.
4. **Applying the model to other real-world settings.** The model that we developed in this work can be applied to a variety of real-world settings where fraudulent activities are prevalent. For example, the model could be used to study the problem of policing and monitoring fraudulent activities in online advertising, financial markets, and healthcare. Applying the model to other real-world settings would help to demonstrate the generalizability of the model and its potential impact.
5. **Developing a theoretical framework for analyzing the impact of fraudulent activities on the system.** The model that we developed in this work can be used to analyze the impact of fraudulent activities on the system. However, there is currently no theoretical framework for analyzing the impact of fraudulent activities on the system. Developing a theoretical framework would help to provide a deeper understanding of the problem and its implications.
