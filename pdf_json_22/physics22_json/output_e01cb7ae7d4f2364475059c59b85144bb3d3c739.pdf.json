This technique is especially useful when collecting data on cosmic phenomena such as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation, as it provides the ability to separate the CMB signal from foreground contaminants. We develop a method to determine the optimal linear combinations of wavelengths (\u201ccolors\u201d) that can be reconstructed for a given telescope design and the number of colors that are measurable with high signal-to-noise ratio.

            "text": "Optimal method for reconstructing polychromatic maps from broadband observations with an asymmetric antenna pattern\nBrianna Cantrall,1 Solomon Quinn,2 and Emory F. Bunn1\n1Department of Physics, University of Richmond 2Committee on Computational and Applied Mathematics, University of Chicago\nBroadband time-ordered data obtained from telescopes with a wavelength-dependent, asymmetric beam pattern can be used to extract maps at multiple wavelengths from a single scan. This technique is especially useful when collecting data on cosmic phenomena such as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation, as it provides the ability to separate the CMB signal from foreground contaminants. We develop a method to determine the optimal linear combinations of wavelengths (\u201ccolors\u201d) that can be reconstructed for a given telescope design and the number of colors that are measurable with high signal-to-noise ratio. The optimal colors are found as eigenvectors of a matrix derived from the inverse noise covariance matrix.

We propose using the optimal colors determined from the isotropic case even when the actual scanning pattern is not isotropic (e.g., covers only part of the sky). We perform simulations showing that maps in multiple colors can be reconstructed accurately from both full-sky and partial-sky scans. Although the original motivation for this research comes from mapping the CMB, this method of polychromatic map-making will have broader applications throughout astrophysics.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nIn many if not most astrophysical observations, both spatial and spectral information about the incoming radiation are invaluable. Unfortunately, some astrophysical surveys are made with broadband detectors that provide little spectral information. This problem is particularly noteworthy in observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, for which more fine-grained spectral information would be invaluable in separating the CMB signal from foreground contamination.\nReliably separating the different physical components contributing to CMB maps is an extremely important step in drawing conclusions from these observations (e.g., [1] and references therein). These inferences must generally be drawn from a relatively small number of broadband maps. Numerous methods have been developed to achieve this goal (e.g., [2\u20135]). To do this separation as well as possible, one must extract every bit of information from the data one has. In this paper, we examine the prospect of extracting spectral information from a single broadband total-intensity survey.\nWhen a telescope scans the sky with a broadband detector, each observation in the time-ordered data is a weighted average of signals at different spatial points and at different wavelengths. Because the antenna pattern is inevitably wavelength-dependent, it is in principle possible to reconstruct spectral information even though each individual observation lacks spectral resolution [6\u201311]. Because such spectral information can be extremely valuable, we develop in this paper a systematic approach to determining the amount and kind of information that can be reconstructed.\nReconstruction of spectral information requires a telescope whose antenna pattern lacks azimuthal symmetry, and which scans the sky in a way that causes it to \u201chit\u201d a given point in different orientations. We illustrate this with a toy model. Imagine that a patch of sky contains a wavelength-dependent sinusoidal variation I(x, \u03bb) = f(\u03bb) sin(kx), where (x, y) denote position on the sky. A telescope observes this patch with an antenna pattern that smooths the sky in the x direction but not in the y direction. If the smoothing is wavelength-dependent, then different wavelengths will be suppressed by different amounts, and the observed signal will be a sine wave whose amplitude is a weighted sum of the amplitudes at different wavelengths, \u222b f(\u03bb)w(\u03bb)d\u03bb, for some weighting function w(\u03bb) that accounts for the wavelength-dependent smoothing. Now suppose that the telescope is rotated so that it smooths in the y direction but not the x direction. Then the observed signal amplitude will be an unweighted sum proportional to \u222b f(\u03bb)d\u03bb. Comparing these two signals would allow the observer to reconstruct a \u201ccolor\u201d in addition to the overall amplitude of the signal, even though each individual observation is a broadband total-power measurement.\nIn the CMB context, the instrument for which this observation is most likely to be relevant is the Q & U Bolometric Interferometer for Cosmology (QUBIC) ([8] and references therein), because the technique of bolometric interferometry combines highly asymmetric beam patterns with broadband detectors. However, the technique may be applicable in other contexts involving telescopes with highly asymmetric beams, such as the CHIME 21-cm experiment [12], which uses long parabolic antennas.\nIn this paper, we do not focus on application to a particular telescope, but on developing a formalism for quantifying\nar X\niv :2\n20 5.\n07 98\n8v 2\n[ as\ntr o-\nph .I\nM ]\n2 J\nun 2\n02 3\n2 the available information for any given instrument. We will present illustrative examples, some of which are loosely inspired by QUBIC and by a long parabolic dish, but they are not intended to mimic any particular experiment in detail.\nOur approach is based on a generalization of the well-known minimum-variance mapmaking procedure for turning time-ordered data into sky maps (e.g., [13]). In the original formalism, one reconstructs a single spatially-dependent signal s\u20d7, which is an Np-dimensional vector giving the signal in each of Np pixels. To extend this formalism to the polychromatic case, we divide the observed wavelength range into Nf bins and consider a wavelength-dependent signal at each pixel. Our signal vector thus has dimension NpNf .\nIt is straightforward to write down the formal minimum-variance reconstruction of this signal vector from a given\nvector d\u20d7 of time-ordered data. Because the wavelength-dependent information is limited, this reconstruction has extremely large error bars and is of limited use. Certain linear combinations of wavelengths, however, can be reliably reconstructed. That is, we can choose weights v1, . . . , vNf and reconstruct a signal at each pixel p of the form\nup = \u2211 f vfspf , (1.1)\nwhere spf refers to the signal at pixel p and wavelength f . We will identify the weights v\u20d7 that can be reconstructed most accurately. The noise level in these reconstructions can also be computed, so we can determine how many such wavelength combinations are worth reconstructing in any given experiment.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the mathematical and computational formalism. Section III presents illustrative results of tests performed on simulated data. A discussion of some conclusions is found in Section IV. Some mathematical details are relegated to appendices.\nII. METHOD\nThis section contains information about the mathematical methods behind this research. We begin by reviewing the map-making problem in the monochromatic case (e.g., [13\u201315]), and then extend those results to a case containing polychromatic data. We then describe the method to be used when mapping signals obtained from such data, as well as various operations to perform to optimize these calculations. Finally, we show that there are specific modes that are filtered out of the reconstructed maps; the same modes must be filtered out of the true signal when comparing the two.\nA. Monochromatic Map-Making\nThe data collected by a telescope can be modeled by the linear equation\nd\u20d7 = As\u20d7+ n\u20d7, (2.1)\nwhere the data vector d\u20d7 of size Nt contains all of the time-ordered data (TOD) gathered by a given telescope, the pointing matrix A of size Nt \u00d7 Np contains information about which pixels each TOD element is sensitive to, the signal vector s\u20d7 of size Np contains the intensity of light as a function of position (i.e., pixel), and the vector n\u20d7 of size Nt contains instrument noise. The quantities Nt and Np are the number of timesteps and the number of pixels, respectively.\nThe elements of the pointing matrix can be written as\nAtp = A(Rt(r\u0302p))Apix, (2.2)\nwhere A(r\u0302) is the antenna pattern at some specific reference orientation, Apix is the area of a pixel, introduced here for later convenience in Section IIC when transforming to a spherical harmonic basis, and Rt is a rotation matrix that transforms A(r\u0302) to the orientation at time t and pixel p. It is often the case that the antenna pattern is composed of a superposition of many individual peaks, each of which having the same Gaussian-like shape. For example, in a single-difference measurement, A would consist of two offset antenna patterns, one with negative weight. Of more relevance to the current work is the case of interferometer-like antenna patterns such as that produced by QUBIC, which consists of many identically-shaped peaks.\nIn this case, it is numerically preferable to replace the true sky signal s\u20d7 with a smoothed signal that has been convolved with the shape of a single peak in A [14]. After making this replacement, the pointing matrix A becomes\n3 very sparse, with each row containing only a few nonzero elements corresponding to the \u03b4-function-like peaks at the individual pixels corresponding to the peaks of A. This renders computations and storage of A much more efficient.\nWith this substitution, the map-making algorithm returns an estimate of the smoothed signal, not the true signal. If one wished (unwisely) to try to reconstruct features smaller than the beam scale, one could attempt to deconvolve the reconstructed map.\nWhen solving for the best estimate of the signal, we want to retrieve all information possible about the signal given the data. However, the pointing matrix is not square and often very large, making inversion impossible. There are many methods of finding a solution to this problem, and in this research we use the minimum-variance reconstruction method used by the COBE-DMR team [16] (among others). The estimated signal map is\ns\u0302 = (ATN\u22121A)\u22121ATN\u22121d\u20d7, (2.3)\nwhere s\u0302 is a vector of size Np that is the best estimate of s\u20d7, and N is the noise covariance matrix of size Nt \u00d7 Nt, such that N = \u27e8n\u20d7n\u20d7T \u27e9. The resulting s\u0302 is the unbiased, maximum-likelihood estimator of s\u20d7, meaning that, by the Crame\u0301r-Rao inequality, it is also the minimum-variance unbiased estimator. The noise covariance matrix of s\u0302 is\nM = (ATN\u22121A)\u22121 (2.4)\nThis method of map-making loses no information contained in the TOD [13].\nB. Polychromatic Map-Making\nWe now consider maps that are functions of wavelength. To be specific, we discretize the wavelength range under consideration into Nf narrow wavebands, which we call wavelength bins, each with a different signal map. The signal vector s\u20d7 consists of all of these maps stacked on top of each other and thus has size NpNf . We will discuss the required number of wavelength bins in Section III.\nThe pointing matrix A now has dimensions Nt \u00d7NpNf . The elements of A are\nAt(pf) = A(Rt(r\u0302p);\u03bbf )Apix. (2.5)\nThis expression differs from equation (2.2) in that the columns of A are now labeled by a pair of indices (pf) corresponding to pixel and wavelength bin, and the antenna pattern now depends on the wavelength \u03bbf . Continuing to treat A as a sparse matrix as described in Section IIA, each row of A now contains a copy of the antenna pattern for each waveband. We compute the pointing matrix for each antenna pattern separately as sparse matrices at a given waveband, and then horizontally stack these matrices, creating a matrix composed of Nf sub-matrices.\nOne can perform the minimum-variance map reconstruction (2.3) and reconstruct the polychromatic signal with noise covariance M given by equation (2.4). However, the NpNf \u00d7 NpNf covariance matrix is unwieldy. Moreover, in practice the inverse noise covariance matrix\nM\u22121 = ATN\u22121A (2.6)\nis typically nearly singular, so the inversion to produce M is unstable. Even when the inversion can be performed accurately, the diagonal elements (i.e., the noise variances in the reconstructed signal) are so large that the reconstructed signal is not particularly useful. This occurs because there is simply not enough information to reconstruct the full wavelength-dependent signal with reasonable accuracy.\nRather than reconstructing the entire polychromatic signal, we will reconstruct only certain linear combinations of wavelengths chosen to have low noise. To be specific, we will find a set of Nf -dimensional vectors v\u20d7 (1), v\u20d7(2), . . . representing different combinations of wavelengths that we wish to estimate. Each vector v\u20d7(i) corresponds to a signal map u\u20d7(i), given by\nu(i)p = \u2211 f v (i) f spf . (2.7)\nFor instance, if v (i) f is the same for all f , the resulting map u\u20d7 (i) would be the total power across all wavelengths, while a v\u20d7(i) that was positive on one half of the wavelength range and negative on the other would give a \u201ccolor\u201d map. Suppose that we have chosen an orthonormal basis of such Nf vectors. Then there is an orthogonal operator U such that\nu\u20d7 = Us\u20d7, (2.8)\n4 where u\u20d7 is the concatenation of the maps u\u20d7(i) just as s\u20d7 is the concatenation of the individual wavelength maps. To be specific, U consists of one copy for every pixel of the orthogonal Nf \u00d7 Nf matrix whose rows are the vectors v\u20d7(i): U(pi)(p\u2032f) = v (i) f \u03b4pp\u2032 . Our goal will be to choose the vectors v\u20d7\n(i) so that the useful information in the data is concentrated in the first few vectors, and we can safely ignore the later, noise-dominated ones.\nThe optimal estimator of u\u20d7 is easily shown to be\nu\u0302 = Us\u0302 (2.9)\nas one would expect. That is, each individual \u201ccolor\u201d map has pixel values u\u0302(i)p = \u2211 f v (i) f s\u0302pf . (2.10)\nThe estimated map corresponding to the ith wavelength combination has inverse noise covariance matrix elements\n(M (i) \u22121 )pp\u2032 = \u2211 f,f \u2032 v (i) f M \u22121 (pf)(p\u2032f \u2032)v (i) f \u2032 . (2.11)\nLet w(i) be the trace of this matrix. This quantity is the sum of the inverse noise variances of all pixels in the ith map and is a natural figure of merit for the map. It can be written as\nw(i) = \u2211 f,f \u2032 v (i) f M\u0304 \u22121 ff \u2032v (i) f \u2032 , (2.12)\nwhere the Nf \u00d7Nf matrix M\u0304\u22121 has elements\nM\u0304\u22121ff \u2032 = \u2211 p M\u22121(pf)(pf \u2032). (2.13)\nThe best linear combination of wavelengths is the one that maximizes the corresponding w. This is the eigenvector of M\u0304\u22121 with the largest eigenvalue. Indeed, for any number of maps k between 1 and Nf , the best k maps to reconstruct are the ones corresponding to the greatest k eigenvectors of M\u0304\u22121. See Appendix A for the proof of this claim.\nC. Transformation to Spherical Harmonic Space\nComputing M\u0304\u22121 in pixel space remains a computationally expensive task. However, if we assume we are performing an isotropic experiment, which we define as one in which a given telescope is able to scan the whole sky uniformly and in all orientations, we can instead perform this calculation in a basis of spherical harmonic coefficients. In this basis, the noise covariance matrix is\nM\u0303 = (Y\u2020A\u2020N\u22121AY)\u22121, (2.14)\nwhere Y is the linear operator that transforms a set of spherical harmonic coefficients into the corresponding map, whose elements are\nY(pf)(lm) = Ylm(r\u0302p), (2.15)\nindependent of f . M\u0303 is of size NpNf \u00d7NL, where NL is the number of alm coefficients we are estimating. As shown in Appendix B, under the assumptions of an isotropic experiment, the matrix is block diagonal, with no correlation between lm pairs. Moreover, the blocks for all m corresponding to a given l are identical.\nLet Cl be one such block of M\u0303 \u22121. Then, holding an lm pair fixed and suppressing the index l, the elements of Cl\nare\nCff \u2032 = M\u0303 \u22121 (lmf)(lmf \u2032) = \u03c3 \u22122 t (Y \u2020A\u2020AY )ff \u2032 , (2.16)\nassuming white noise with N = \u03c32t 1.\n5\nAs shown in Appendix B,\nCff \u2032 = Nt \u03c32t 1 2l + 1 \u2211 m\u2032 Alm\u2032fA \u2217 lm\u2032f \u2032 , (2.17)\nwhere Almf is a coefficient in the spherical harmonic expansion of the antenna pattern at wavelength \u03bbf . For any given l, the eigenvectors of Cl with largest eigenvalues give the best linear combinations of wavelengths, with inverse noise variances given by the eigenvalues. To obtain the best linear combinations over all l, we should \u201ctrace over\u201d lm, just as we trace over all pixels in defining the matrix M\u0304\u22121 in equation (2.13). In fact, because of the orthonormality in spherical harmonics, this trace, namely\u2211\nl\n(2l + 1)Cl, (2.18)\nis equivalent to M\u0304\u22121 for isotropic experiments (i.e., in the limit Nt \u2192 \u221e with all antenna pattern orientations equally sampled).\nBecause the spherical-harmonic formalism is extremely efficient, we use it to determine the best linear combinations of wavelengths to reconstruct, even when the actual data do not scan the whole sky isotropically.\nD. Filtering the Pure Signal\nWhile computing M\u0304\u22121 in spherical harmonic space allows us to avoid computing M\u22121 when finding linear combinations, the computation of s\u0302 in equation (2.3) still relies on M. Because M\u22121 is the product of sparse matrices, we can use conjugate gradient methods to solve\nM\u22121s\u0302 = ATN\u22121d\u20d7 (2.19)\nfor s\u0302 and hence for the optimal wavelength combinations u\u0302 efficiently. Unfortunately, M\u22121 has a null space of modes to which the observations are completely insensitive. For example, consider the monopole subspace of signals that are independent of position but may depend on wavelength. The pointing matrix treats all wavelengths identically in this subspace \u2013 the wavelength dependence of the antenna pattern is irrelevant for monopole signals. There are thus Nf \u2212 1 wavelength-dependent monopole maps that lie in the null space of A and hence of M\u22121. In fact, for any l, only 2l + 1 wavelength combinations can be reconstructed, so for every l such that 2l + 1 < Nf , there are Nf \u2212 (2l + 1) unmeasureable modes. Because of the AT on the right side of equation (2.3), the right side lies in this null space and the conjugate gradient solution proceeds without issue. In interpreting the resulting signal estimator, one must remember that these modes have been filtered out of it. In particular, when we compare reconstructed maps with a hypothetical input signal, we must filter the input maps. To be specific, we can compute a filtered input signal map s\u0304 from a candidate signal map s\u20d7 by finding a conjugate gradient solution to\n(ATN\u22121A)s\u0304 = ATN\u22121(As\u20d7). (2.20)\nThis process removes the undetectable modes from the pure signal, allowing for a fair comparison of s\u0302 and s\u0304. A visual representation of the pure, filtered, and estimated signals can be found in Section III.\nIII. RESULTS\nA. Antenna patterns\nWe tested three different asymmetric antenna patterns to produce simulated data in order to perform this analysis for polychromatic map-making. These are, in order of increasing complexity, a great-circle antenna pattern, 1-dimensional interferometer antenna pattern, and a 2-dimensional interferometer antenna pattern, as shown in Fig. 1. Here and throughout this paper, all pixelized data on the sphere are in HEALPix pixelization [17], and all computations on such maps use the HEALPy Python implementation of HEALPix [18].\nWe emphasize that our goal is not to simulate actual instruments in full detail (although the 2-D interferometer may be considered \u201cQUBIC-like\u201d [8, 9], and the great-circle pattern is \u201cCHIME-like\u201d [12]). Rather, our goal is to show illustrative examples of asymmetric antenna patterns of the sort to which the methods described in this paper are applicable.\nThe great-circle pattern is that produced by a telescope that has much sharper resolution along one direction than along the orthogonal direction (as might be produced by a parabolic dish that is long but not wide). In the flat-sky approximation, its antenna pattern would be of the form A(x, y) = exp[\u2212x2/(2\u03c32x) \u2212 y2/(2\u03c32y)] with \u03c3x \u226b \u03c3y. As noted in Section IIA, no useful information can be recovered on scales smaller than \u03c3y, so we take the signal vector we are attempting to reconstruct to have been smoothed by a Gaussian with beam width \u03c3y. In this case, the antenna\npattern has zero width in the y direction and width \u03c3 = \u221a \u03c32x \u2212 \u03c32y in the x direction. The antenna pattern is thus a\nGaussian of width \u03c3 lying along a great circle, with delta-function behavior in the perpendicular direction. In the one- and two-dimensional interferometer patterns, we imagine an antenna pattern with a series of equallyspaced peaks lying under a broad Gaussian envelope. The peaks are all assumed to have identical shapes, and once again we take the reconstructed signal to have been smooothed by these shapes, allowing us to replace each peak with a delta function. The two-dimensional interferometer pattern is thus similar to what would be found in an interferometer with a square array of antennas.\nIn all cases, the antenna patterns scale linearly with wavelength \u2013 that is, the widths of Gaussians and the spacing between peaks are all proportional to \u03bbf . Since this scaling is the only way wavelength appears in any of our computations, we express \u03bbf in units that make the descriptions of our antenna patterns as simple as possible. For the Great Circle pattern, we assume a Gaussian beam and measure wavelength in units such that the beam width along the great circle is \u03bbf . For the interferometer patterns, we measure wavelength in units such that the space between peaks is exactly \u03bbf . The heights of the peaks are determined by the beam pattern of a single antenna, which is of course broader than the individual peaks. We take this pattern to be Gaussian with width 1.32\u03bbf , meaning that the first peak away from the center has height 0.5 times the central peak. When modeling the antenna patterns, we keep all peaks with amplitude at lest 10\u22123 times the central peak.\nB. Simulated signals\nThroughout this section, the simulated signal vector, s\u20d7, is composed of linear combinations of two independent maps, with wavelength-dependent weights. To be specific, let f and g be two Gaussian random fields on the sphere. Then the signal at any location r\u0302 and wavelength \u03bb is a linear interpolation of these two functions:\ns(r\u0302;\u03bb) = wf(r\u0302) + (1\u2212 w)g(r\u0302), (3.1)\nwhere w = (\u03bb \u2212 \u03bbmin)/(\u03bbmax \u2212 \u03bbmin) ranges from 0 at the minimum wavelength in the observed band to 1 at the maximum wavelength.\nThe pointing matrix is applied to this signal, and then random noise is added to that product to create d\u20d7. The noise vector, n\u20d7, is created by generating Nt independent Gaussian random numbers with mean 0 and a user-supplied standard deviation \u03c3t. The reconstructed signal s\u0302 is then computed using the conjugate gradient method with the expression described in equation (2.3).\nThe parameters used in the maps in this section can be found in Table I. In all cases, we use HEALPix resolution Nside = 32, leading to Np = 12288. We follow the procedure described in the next section to determine the number Nf of frequency sub-bands required for each antenna pattern. Finally, we choose the number of time steps to be Nt = 2NfNp, which insures that the linear system to be solved in the full signal reconstruction is well-conditioned. (Although the full signal reconstruction is not particularly useful due to its large errors, it is still convenient for it to be possible to compute it numerically.)\nC. Full-sky harmonic space calculations.\nWe first performed calculations in harmonic space for a hypothetical full-sky experiment with isotropic random sampling of antenna orientations.\nWe begin by considering the choice of Nf , the number of wavelength bins in our input signal vector. We wish effects of wavelength discretization to be unimportant, so we choose Nf to be large enough to produce a reasonable approximation of the continuous case. In particular, as Nf increases, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Cl should approach stable continuum limits. We use the ratio of the two highest eigenvalues as a measure of this approach to stability. These ratios are plotted in Fig. 2. Based on these plots, we chose the values of Nf in Table I.\nWe can immediately note from Fig. 2 that the two-dimensional interferometer is far more promising than the other two antenna patterns for polychromatic map-making: the smaller eigenvalue ratios mean that the uncertainties in the second-best map will be closer to those in the best map in this case than in the other two.\nFig. 3 shows eigenvectors of M\u0304\u22121 for the various antenna patterns. For the two interferometer patterns, the eigenvectors plotted have eigenvalues that are at least 0.1 times the largest eigenvalue, meaning that the noise levels in these maps will be worse than those in the best map by at most a factor of \u221a 10. For the great-circle case, the second-best eigenvector is shown even though it lies below this threshold.\nIt may come as no surprise that the linear combination corresponding to the smallest uncertainty is reminiscent of a total-intensity map, with weights approximately equal at all wave-bands. Thus, the bulk of the additional information available via polychromatic map-making (as compared to monochromatic) is found in the second-largest eigenvector, which represents a color map.\nAs described in Section II, the eigenvectors are the optimal colors to reconstruct. The horizontal axis is the bin number in wavelength, with 0 corresponding to \u03bbmin and the maximum value to \u03bbmax. The legend gives the eigenvalue, scaled by the\nmaximum eigenvalue.\nD. Full-sky maps in pixel space\nWhile the harmonic-space calculations above tell us the expected noise level in the reconstructions, it is helpful to view actual maps of the signals. Fig. 4a and 4b show maps of the best linear combination of wavelengths of s\u20d7 and s\u0302 for the 2-Dimensional Interferometer pattern. The eigenvector containing the best linear combination from this simulation is the same as the one shown in Fig. 3a. The notation U map in the figure titles refers to a signal map in a selected linear combination, such as in the notation of equation (2.7).\nAs mentioned earlier, these near-total-intensity maps are essentially the same as those obtained by monochromatic mapmaking; to evaluate the polychromatic method we must look at the second-best linear combination, that is, to the eigenvector with the second-largest eigenvalue in Fig. 3a.\nFig. 5 shows maps of this combination. It is clear from panels (a) and (b) that the pure signal and estimated signal have discrepancies in structure on a large scale. Panel (c) confirms this impression by showing the difference between the two.\nThis difference is due to the null space of M\u22121 described in Section IID: modes in the null space that are present in the original signal are absent in the reconstructed map. If we filter the true signal s\u20d7 by removing the null space of M\u22121 before taking the linear combination, we get the map shown in panel (d). The difference between this and the reconstructed map [panel (e)] is smaller and lacks the large-scale power of the original difference map.\nFig. 6 shows the second-best linear combination of wavelengths for the 1-Dimensional Interferometer pattern, as shown in Fig. 3b. Fig. 7 shows the second-best linear combination of wavelengths for the Great Circle pattern, as shown in Fig. 3c. These maps give visual proof to the claim that the Great Circle antenna pattern produces the least reliable linear combinations of wavelengths.\nE. Half Sky\nThe results of the previous section apply to an idealized isotropic all-sky experiment. In this section, we show results for a hypothetical experiment with partial sky coverage. As described in Section I, we continue to perform the calculation of M\u0304\u22121 in a spherical harmonic basis \u2013 that is, the wavelength linear combinations we choose to reconstruct are optimized as if we were doing an all-sky isotropic experiment.\nFor the examples illustrated here, we assume the observations cover half the sky: the pointings are chosen randomly and isotropically as before, but with pointing centers restricted to the northern hemisphere \u03b8 < \u03c0/2. Fig. 8 shows a half-sky reconstruction for the 2-Dimensional Interferometer pattern. The stark asymmetry of the 1-Dimensional and Great Circle antenna patterns compared to the 2-Dimensional antenna pattern makes it more difficult to achieve an isotropic experiment with fewer timesteps, namely the ability to scan the sky in all possible orientations of the telescope. Thus, for half-sky reconstructions, we must increase the\n10\n11\nnumber of timesteps for the 1-Dimensional and Great Circle antenna patterns. Fig. 9 shows a half-sky reconstruction for the 1-Dimensional antenna pattern with five times more timesteps than in the full-sky reconstruction. While a qualitative look at these maps does not show large differences between the filtered and estimated signals, the noise map in Fig. 9c shows once again the largely random noise we expect between the two signals. Fig. 10 shows a half-sky reconstruction for the Great Circle antenna pattern. For the purpose of time, this simulation was run with the same number of timesteps as in the full-sky case. If this antenna pattern were to be used for polychromatic reconstruction, a larger data set would be required to yield more accurate results.\nF. Noise covariance\nIn this section we illustrate the noise properties of the reconstructed maps. The matrix M\u22121 is the noise covariance matrix for the entire multiwavelength signal. We can represent this matrix in the eigenbasis in wavelength space (while leaving it unaltered in pixel space). Then each row of the matrix will show the covariance of the noise in each reconstructed signal at a given pixel. Because M is sparse, any given row is easily found via the conjugate gradient method.\nFigure 11 illustrates the result of such a calculation. The row of the noise covariance matrix corresponds to a particular pixel in the northern hemisphere and to the second-best wavelength combination. The maximum value in the middle panel is thus the noise variance for this reconstructed signal value. The structure in the middle panel shows that the noise has some spatial correlation, and the nonzero values in the first and third panel show that there are nonzero but weak cross-correlations between the different reconstructed wavelength combinations.\nAnother way to visualize the spatial structure of the noise is via the noise power spectra Nl for the various reconstructed maps. Fig. 12 shows Nl for the three best linear combinations of wavebands using the 2-Dimensional Interferometer pattern. These were computed by applying the polychromatic map reconstruction algorithm to 100 sets of white-noise TOD. The noise power spectrum Nl for each reconstructed color is the average of the power spectra of the reconstructed maps.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nWe have presented a formalism for finding the optimal \u201ccolors\u201d that can be extracted from a total-intensity broadband telescope that scans the sky with an asymmetric beam pattern. This approach is inspired by CMB observations, which often involve broadband detectors covering a small number of wavelength bands. In analyzing CMB sky maps, color information is important for component separation but is unfortunately often in short supply. The ability to squeeze extra color information out of such maps is therefore of particular importance.\nThe underlying idea behind this method was developed as part of the design of the QUBIC telescope, and experiments of this sort, whose antenna patterns are highly asymmetric, are most likely to benefit from it.\nAlthough the method is inspired by CMB studies, color information is of course invaluable in many areas of astrophysics, so it is quite possible that the methods developed herein will have broader applications.\nWe have shown that for some antenna patterns, color maps can be produced that have noise levels of the same order of magnitude as the total-intensity maps, indicating that significant additional information is likely to be available.\n12\nThe colors that we find via this method are optimal for the specific case of an all-sky isotropic scan pattern. Real scans do not necessarily achieve this coverage. However, we have demonstrated in our simulations that the noise levels achieved in partial-sky experiments are similar to those in the all-sky case, as expected.\nPolychromatic mapmaking is possible in practice for observations that scan the sky with broadband detectors, using an instrument with an asymmetric beam. CMB observations are the most natural arena in which to apply this method: CMB detectors are generally broadband; color information is vital for foreground separation, and some CMB instruments have asymmetric beams. The QUBIC experiment in particular is the inspiration for this work: one of the authors is a member of the QUBIC collaboration, and this work builds on methods developed for QUBIC [6, 9]. We intend to explore implementation of the methods developed here into the QUBIC analysis pipeline.\nAlthough QUBIC is the main use case we envision, the method may be applicable in other contexts. The highly asymmetric antenna patterns that make the method most promising are likely to be found in other interferometric contexts or possibly for experiments such as CHIME [12] with long narrow antennas.\nHaving shown that this method is promising, we envision a number of ways in which it can be extended:\n\u2022 The method can be tested on simulations of other antenna patterns and scan strategies, including, for example, a more realistic model of QUBIC.\n\u2022 The method can be applied to maps containing realistic astrophysical components \u2013 e.g., a simulation including CMB fluctuations and foreground contaminants such as dust and synchrotron.\n\u2022 Generalization of the method to polarization data should be straightforward. The foreground-removal problem is particularly acute for CMB polarization experiments, as the polarization signal is weak and the polarization properties of the foregrounds are more uncertain (e.g., [19]).\n13\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nEarly stages of this work were supported by NSF Award 141013 and by a visitor grant from the Institut Lagrange (Paris).

(A1)\nSuppose that we want to estimate u = v\u20d7 \u00b7 s\u20d7 for some vector v\u20d7. We define an estimator\nu\u0302 = \u2211 d vds\u0302d. (A2)\nThen\n\u27e8(\u03b4u\u0302)2\u27e9 = \u27e8(v\u20d7 \u00b7 \u03b4s\u0302)2\u27e9 = \u27e8(v\u20d7T \u03b4s\u0302)(\u03b4s\u0302T v\u20d7)\u27e9 = v\u20d7T \u27e8\u03b4s\u0302\u03b4s\u0302T \u27e9v\u20d7 = v\u20d7TMv\u20d7.\n(A3)\n15\nWe want to choose the \u201cbest\u201d vector v\u20d7 \u2013 that is, the one that minimizes the uncertainty \u2013 subject to the constraint |v\u20d7| = 1, or \u2211d v\u20d7 2d = 1, for\n\u03b4u\u03022 = \u2211 d,g vdMdgvg. (A4)\nWe differentiate with respect to an arbitrary component vh such that\n\u2202(\u03b4u\u03022)\n\u2202vh = \u2211 g Mhgvg + \u2211 d vdMdh = 2(Mv)h. (A5)\nIntroducing a Lagrange multiplier to apply the constraint gives\n(Mv)h = \u03bbvh. (A6)\nThe optimal linear combination of data points is thus an eigenvector of the covariance matrix. From equation (A3), it follows that\n\u03b4u\u03022 = v\u20d7T\u03bbv\u20d7 = \u03bbv\u20d7T v\u20d7 = \u03bb. (A7)\nThe eigenvalue of the covariance matrix is thus the uncertainty variance in the linear combination corresponding to the eigenvector. The optimal linear combination is the eigenvalue corresponding to the smallest eigenvector.\nAppendix B: Covariance Matrices in Spherical Harmonic Space\nAssuming white noise (N = \u03c32t 1), an arbitrary element of the harmonic-space inverse noise covariance matrix M\u0303 \u22121\ncan be written\nM\u0303\u22121(lmf)(l\u2032m\u2032f \u2032) = \u03c3 \u22122 t \u2211 t \u2211 p A(Rt(r\u0302p);\u03bbf )ApixYlm(r\u0302p) \u2211 p\u2032 A(Rt(r\u0302p\u2032);\u03bbf \u2032)ApixYl\u2032m\u2032(r\u0302p\u2032)\u2217  . (B1)\nWe assume that the pixelization is fine enough that sums over pixels can be converted to integrals. Moreover, we assume an isotropic experiment, meaning that the rotation matrices Rt densely and uniformly sample SO(3), the space of all possible rotation matrices. Under this assumption, we can also convert the sum over t to an integral. The result is\nM\u0303\u22121(lmf)(l\u2032m\u2032f \u2032) = Nt\n8\u03c02\u03c32t \u222b SO(3) dR flmf (R)f \u2217 l\u2032m\u2032f \u2032(R), (B2)\nwhere Nt is the number of timesteps, 8\u03c0 2 is the volume of the space SO(3), and\nflmf (R) = \u222b d2r\u20d7A(R(r\u20d7);\u03bbf )Ylm(r\u20d7). (B3)\nExpanding the antenna pattern in spherical harmonic coefficients gives A(R(r\u20d7);\u03bbf ) = \u2211 L,M ALMfYLM (R(r\u20d7)). (B4)\nSubstituting this into equation B3 gives\nflmf (R) = \u2211 L,M ALMf \u222b YLM (R(r\u20d7))Ylm(r\u20d7)d 2r\u20d7. (B5)\nThe rotation of the spherical harmonic matrix Ylm can be expressed in terms of a Wigner matrix, Ylm(R(r\u20d7)) = \u2211 m\u2032 Dlmm\u2032(R)Ylm\u2032(r\u20d7). (B6)\n16\nSubstituting this into equation B5 gives\nflmf (R) = \u2211 L,M ALMfD L MM \u2032(R) \u222b YLM \u2032(r\u20d7)Ylm(r\u20d7)d 2r\u20d7 = \u2211 M AlMfD l Mm, (B7)\nusing the orthonormality of the spherical harmonics. Substituting this expression into equation (B2) gives\nM\u0303\u22121(lmf)(l\u2032m\u2032f \u2032) = Nt\n8\u03c02\u03c32t \u2211 M,M \u2032 AlMfA \u2217 l\u2032M \u2032f \u2032 \u222b SO(3) dRDlMm(D l\u2032 M \u2032m\u2032) \u2217. (B8)\nThis integral is (8\u03c02/(2l + 1))\u03b4ll\u2032\u03b4MM \u2032\u03b4mm\u2032 [20], leading to the conclusion that\nM\u22121(lmf)(l\u2032m\u2032f)\u2032 = \u03b4ll\u2032\u03b4mm\u2032 Nt \u03c32t 1 2l + 1 \u2211 M AlMfA \u2217 lMf \u2032 . (B9)\nThe matrix M\u0303\u22121 is thus block diagonal in lm, with blocks that depend only on l, not m."
