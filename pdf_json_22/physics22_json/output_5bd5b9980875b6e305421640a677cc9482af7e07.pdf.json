            "text": "A limit shape phenomenon in statistical mechanics is the appearance of a most probable macroscopic state. This state is usually characterized by a well-defined boundary separating frozen and fluctuating (liquid) spatial regions. Other, macroscopically different states are exponentially suppressed in the thermodynamic limit. The formation of the limit shape is enforced by domain-wall-type boundary conditions. Well-known examples of limit shape phenomenon are the problems of emptiness formation probability in free fermions [1], and the formation of a frozen region in dimer models [2]. In the former, the macroscopic empty region formed in a system of free one-dimensional fermions has the shape of an astroid [1]. In the example of dimer coverings of the Aztec diamond lattice, the curve separating frozen from liquid regions has a shape of a circle and is a subject of the Arctic Circle Theorem [3]. Remarkably, due to the existence of an exact mapping between lattice fermion models and dimer systems, one can study both emptiness and arctic boundary formations using the same set of tools and techniques from quantum field theory.\nThe limit shape phenomenon has a long history with earlier works on representation\ntheory [4] and crystal surfaces [5, 6, 7]. Over the years, it attracted a lot of interest from physicists, mathematicians, and computer scientists. We refer the reader for recent reviews on various aspects of limit shape phenomena to Refs. [2, 8].\nIn this work, we focus on the arctic limit shape problem in a free fermion description.\nWe consider a one-parameter family of arctic shapes. As a function of a control parameter, \u03bb, two liquid regions merge and form a single liquid domain surrounded by frozen regions. We identify this transition with the transition known in lattice QCD, a statistical model of large random matrices. This model undergoes a third-order phase transition in the distribution of eigenvalues of the Wilson loop operator that occurs as a function of the t\u2019Hooft coupling \u03bb in the large-N limit [9, 10, 11]. Such a link between QCD and a free-fermion chain has been considered before by Pe\u0301rez-Garc\u0301\u0131a and Tierz [12] though they did not consider it in the context of the arctic circle phenomenon. In this context, we present a spatially resolved picture of the transition, computing the exact arctic limiting shape at all values of the coupling \u03bb, which is simply an aspect ratio parameter determined by \u201carctic\u201d boundary conditions. We refer to the phase transition associated with the merger of liquid regions such as arctic circles as the Merger Transition.\nThe merger of two liquid region has been considered before both in the arctic curve\nproblem for dimer covering of the Aztec diamond lattice [13] and for random walkers with nonintersecting constraint [14], where the name \u201ctacnode process\u201d was coined to reflect the shape of the fluctuating region. The random walkers description used in the latter work is practically identical to the free fermion formulation used in this work. In contrast to Refs. [13, 14] we focus here on the phase transition corresponding to the merger of liquid regions. A problem of tiling of the Aztec diamond lattice with cutout corner has been recently considered in Ref. [15]. The third order phase transition\nhas been observed in that setting as a function of the size of the cut-out region and parallels with Gross-Witten-Wadia [9, 10] and Douglas-Kazakov [11] phase transitions has been made [15]. Though these parallels have been drawn, the transition found in [15] is not the same as the Gross-Witten-Wadia one we describe here. The cut-out region produces a diverging density in [15] whereas here we find no such divergence. Finally, we remark that the Coulomb gas technique used in this work allows us to connect the above mentioned phase transition to a more general phenomenon of phase transitions in the constrained Coulomb gases. The latter have been argued to be universally of the third order [16].\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we start by formulating the limit\nshape problem of interest as a partition function of free, one-dimensional, lattice fermions evolving in imaginary time. Evaluating the partition function in the thermodynamic limit by the saddle point method is reduced to finding the momentum distribution problem equivalent to finding the equilibrium distribution of eigenvalues in Ref. [9], and we reproduce it here. We extend the collective description to space-time resolved configurations and propose a method to obtain complete space-time dependence of density and velocity of fermions in Section 3. We compute and illustrate solutions for these fields in the separated and merged phases in Section 4. In Section 5 we analyze the phase transition corresponding to the merger of two arctic circles and provide arguments for its universality in Section 6. Discussion of the results and further arguments in favour of the universality of the phase transition are outlined in Section 7."

            "text": "We start with formulating a model for limit shape phase transitions. Let us consider the following matrix element of the imaginary time propagator of free, one-dimensional, lattice fermions\nZN(R) = \u3008N |e\u22122RH |N\u3009 . (1)\nIt is well known (see, e.g., Ref. [8]) that this matrix element represents the partition function of dimer coverings subject to extreme boundary conditions. The latter are encoded by the initial and final state shown schematically in Fig. 1\n|N\u3009 = |2L\u3009 = \u220f x\u2208IL c\u2020x |0\u3009 (2)\ncorresponding to fully occupied half-integer sites between the positions \u2212L and L of two domain walls, IL = [ \u2212L+ 1 2 , . . . , L\u2212 1 2 ] . The fermionic operators have the following\nanti-commutation relations\n{cx, c \u2020 x\u2032} = \u03b4x,x\u2032 , cx = \u222b \u03c0 \u2212\u03c0 dk 2\u03c0 eikxc(k). (3)\nThe boundary state |2L\u3009 is normalized so that Z2L(0) = 1 and can be viewed as a real space \u201cFermi sea\u201d. The dynamics of the fermions is governed by the tight-binding Hamiltonian\nH = 1\n2 \u2211 x c\u2020x+1cx + h.c. = \u222b \u03c0 \u2212\u03c0 dk 2\u03c0 \u03b5(k)c\u2020(k)c(k) (4)\ncharacterized by the dispersion relation \u03b5(k) = \u2212 cos k. The fermionic operators thus have the following time dependence\nc(k, \u03c4) = e\u03c4Hc(k)e\u2212\u03c4H = e\u2212\u03c4\u03b5(k)c(k) ,\nc\u2020(k, \u03c4) = e\u03c4Hc\u2020(k)e\u2212\u03c4H = e\u03c4\u03b5(k)c\u2020(k) . (5)\nWe proceed calculating the propagator Eq. (9) by inserting the complete set of\neigenstates\nZN(R) = 1\nN ! \u222b \u03c0 \u2212\u03c0 N\u220f i=1 dki 2\u03c0 \u3008N |{k}\u3009 e\u22122R \u2211 l \u03b5(kl) \u3008{k}|N\u3009 , (6)\nwhere |{k}\u3009 = c\u2020(k1) . . . c\u2020(kN) |0\u3009 and\n\u3008{k}|N\u3009 = \u30080| N\u220f i=1 c(ki) \u220f x\u2208IL c\u2020x |0\u3009 = e\u2212i(L\u22121/2) \u2211N i=1 ki\u2206(eik) . (7)\nHere \u2206(eik) is the Vandermonde determinant defined as\n\u2206(eik) = N\ndet i,j=1 ei(i\u22121)kj = \u220f i<j (eiki \u2212 eikj) . (8)\nCombining (6) with (7) we express the partition function as a multiple integral over N quasimomenta:\nZN(R) = 1\nN !\n\u222b dNk\n(2\u03c0)N \u2223\u2223\u2206(eik)\u2223\u22232 e\u22122R\u2211l \u03b5(kl) . (9)\nThe crucial observation is that Eq. (9) coincides exactly with the Gross-Witten-\nWadia (GWW) model [9, 10] of lattice QCD. This model was shown to undergo a third order phase transition in the thermodynamic limit N,R \u2192 \u221e with fixed ratio 2\u03bb = N/R. The transition occurs for critical value of the ratio \u03bb = L/R = 1.\nIn the large N,R limit the statistical sum Eq. (9) can be rewritten as a sum over configurations of collective quasimomenta distribution \u03c3(k) = (\u03c0/R) \u2211\ni \u03b4(k \u2212 ki):\nZN(R) = e \u22124R2f(\u03bb) = \u222b D\u03c3e\u22124R2s[\u03c3;\u00b5] , (10)\nwhere\ns[\u03c3;\u00b5] =\n\u222b dk\n2\u03c0 \u03c3(k)\u03b5(k)\u2212 1 2\n\u222b dk\n2\u03c0\n\u222b dk\n2\u03c0\n\u2032 \u03c3(k) log \u2223\u2223\u2223eik \u2212 eik\u2032\u2223\u2223\u22232 \u03c3(k\u2032) \u2212 \u00b5 (\u222b dk\n2\u03c0 \u03c3(k)\u2212 \u03bb\n) (11)\ncontains the chemical potential \u00b5 to ensure the normalisation\u222b dk\n2\u03c0 \u03c3(k) = \u03bb . (12)\nHere we deviate from the standard notations and scale the action with R rather\nthan N [We also use \u03bb = N/2R, while \u03bb = N/R in Ref. [9]. To compare the results one has to replace \u03bb by \u03bb/2 in our formulae.]. These scaling and notations are natural for the space-time picture we are about to present below. In particular, the free energy\nf(\u03bb) =\n{ \u22121\n4 , \u03bb > 1\n\u2212\u03bb+ 3\u03bb2 4 \u2212 \u03bb2 2 log \u03bb , \u03bb < 1\n(13)\nbecomes a constant for \u03bb > 1 corresponding to lnZN(R) = R 2 independent of N .\nThe result (13) is obtained semiclassically by considering the saddle point\nconfiguration \u03c3(k) minimizing the action Eq. (11). This approximation is controlled by the large parameter R2 and the optimal configuration was found in Ref. [9]. Our main goal is to make the connection between optimal \u03c3(k) and the large scale space-time structure of the fermionic configuration dominating the statistical sum (9). For this we need some technical details about the minimization procedure which we outline below.\nThe action (11) has to be minimized with respect to \u03c3(k) and \u00b5. Therefore, in\naddition to Eq. (12), we obtain the equilibrium condition \u03b5(k)\u2212 \u00b5\u2212 \u222b Ik dk 2\u03c0 \u2032 log \u2223\u2223\u2223eik \u2212 eik\u2032\u2223\u2223\u22232 \u03c3(k\u2032) = 0 , (14)\nvalid for k belonging to the interval(s) Ik where \u03c3(k) > 0. As was discussed in Ref. [9], Eq. (14) is equivalent to the electrostatic problem of finding the equilibrium configuration of charges with density \u03c3(k) interacting among themselves via a 2D logarithmic Coulomb potential and subject to an external field represented by \u03b5(k). It was found that the distribution \u03c3(k) undergoes a qualitative change: for \u03bb > 1 the quasimomenta fill the whole Brillouin zone Ik = [\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0], while for \u03bb < 1 a gap appears near k = \u00b1\u03c0 and Ik = [\u2212kc, kc].\nHere we present this solution using the method of semiclassical loop equations\ndeveloped in Random Matrix Theory [17, 18, 19, 20, 21] (see also Ref. [22] for applications to GWW model). We define a function\nX(k) = \u03bb\u2212 i\u03b5\u2032(k)\u2212 2 \u222b dk\u2032\n2\u03c0\neik\neik \u2212 eik\u2032 \u03c3(k\u2032) , (15)\nanalytic in the complex plane of k cut along an interval on the real axis which represents the support of \u03c3(k), so that\nX(k \u00b1 i0) \u2261 X\u00b1(k) = \u00b1\u03c3(k) . (16)\nThe solution of Eq. (14) can be represented by the implicit relation\nF0(X, k) = X 2 +m2 \u2212 (\u03bb+ cos k)2 = 0 , (17)\nwhere m plays the role of order parameter and has the following behavior across the GWW phase transition\nm =\n{ 0 , \u03bb > 1\n1\u2212 \u03bb , \u03bb < 1 . (18)\nThe implicit relation Eq. (17) is a complex curve of the Random Matrix Model\nbehind GWW model which provides full information about the optimal distribution of eigenvalues eikl . Despite the fact that the leading order behaviour of the fermionic propagator Eq. (9) is obtained using this mean-field solution, little can be said about the dynamics of underlying fermionic model. In the next sections we extract the full space-time picture of the semiclassical dynamics of the free fermions. This space-time resolved picture will be used to explore beautiful hidden features of the GWW third order transition which we reinterpret in the context of the limit shape phenomenon."

            "text": "The solution of GWW model presented in the previous section is essentially static and while it gives the large-R behaviour of the fermionic propagator Eq. (9) the dynamics of the fermions leading to this result is buried under rather technical Coulomb gas calculations.\nIn order to reveal the dynamical picture we need an extra time dimension to\nlabel the time-dependent configurations of dynamical variables. We use the standard approach and split the evolution operator e\u22122RH into a product of infinitesimal evolutions representing the propagator Eq. (1) as the path integral\nZ(R,L) = \u222b D[\u03c3, \u03d1] e\u22124R 2S[\u03c3,\u03d1] (19)\nover time-dependent momentum distribution \u03c3(k, \u03c4) and its conjugate field \u03d1(k, \u03c4) labeled by dimensionless time \u03c4 defined on the interval \u22121 < \u03c4 < 1. The field \u03c3(k) of the previous section corresponds to the time slice \u03c4 = 0 of the imaginary time dynamics with fields for \u03c4 6= 0 integrated out. The action in Eq. (19) can be naturally represented as a sum of two terms, the dynamical term\nSd = 1\n2 \u222b 1 \u22121 d\u03c4 \u222b dk 2\u03c0 [ \u03d1(k, \u03c4)\u2202\u03c4\u03c3(k, \u03c4) + (\u03b5(k)\u2212 \u00b5)\u03c3(k, \u03c4) ] (20)\ncorresponding to the evolution operator and the boundary term which originates from the matrix elements \u2329 {k}f/i \u2223\u2223N\u232a \u2192 \u2329\u03c3f/i\u2223\u2223N\u232a and its complex conjugate in Eq.

The variation w.r.t. fields inside the time interval gives\n\u2202\u03c4\u03c3(k, \u03c4) = 0 , (25) \u2202\u03c4\u03d1(k, \u03c4) = \u03b5(k)\u2212 \u00b5 . (26)\nThese equations hold independently for every quasimomentum k due to the translational invariance of the Hamiltonian. Their solution is\n\u03c3(k, \u03c4) = \u03c3(k) , (27)\n\u03d1(k, \u03c4) = \u03d1(k, 0) + (\u03b5(k)\u2212 \u00b5)\u03c4 . (28)\nThe variation w.r.t. boundary fields \u03b4\u03c3\u00b1 fixes\n\u03d1(k, 0)\u2212 \u03b5(k) + \u00b5 = \u2212\u03b8(k) , (29) \u03d1(k, 0) + \u03b5(k)\u2212 \u00b5 = \u03b8\u0304(k) , (30)\nsince for a time-independent \u03c3(k, \u03c4) = \u03c3\u00b1(k) = \u03c3(k) we can use \u03b8 f/i(k) = \u03b8(k) in Eq. (24). The difference of these equation reproduces exactly the electrostatic equilibrium condition, Eq. (14). This equation also mixes different quasimomenta as the boundary conditions break the translational invariance. The sum of these equations yields \u03d1(k, 0) = 0 for \u03c3(k) = \u03c3(\u2212k), consistent with the time-reversal symmetry of the problem.\nThese time-dependent configurations dominating the path integral Eq. (19) are\nrelated to dynamics of free fermions and, ultimately, to the limit shape emerging as the\ndominant contribution to the statistical sum Eq. (9). This relation is quite non-trivial as we show below. Let us introduce the complex combinations of the time-dependent fields\nX\u00b1(k, \u03c4) = \u00b1\u03c3(k, \u03c4)\u2212 i\u2202k\u03d1(k, \u03c4) . (31)\nOn the equations of motion (27,28) they evolve ballistically\nX\u00b1(k, \u03c4) = X\u00b1(k)\u2212 i\u03b5\u2032(k)\u03c4 , (32)\nfrom the initial value X\u00b1(k, 0) = X\u00b1(k) = \u00b1\u03c3(k) obtained from the complex curve Eq. (17), so that\nF\u03c4 (x, k) = F0(x+ i\u03b5 \u2032(k)\u03c4, k) = (x+ i\u03c4 sin k)2 +m2 \u2212 (\u03bb+ cos k)2 = 0 , (33)\nwhere m is given by (18). The time-dependent spatial configuration dominating the statistical sum Eq. (9) is fully determined by this equation. Indeed, we show in Appendix A that X(k) is a position (in units of R) of a particle with momentum k at \u03c4 = 0, so the ballistic motion Eq. (32) describes (imaginary) time dynamics of free fermions. Our approach is one of the collective field theory [23, 24]. Below we use the method of fermionic droplets in phase space (see Ref. [25] and references therein) extending it to imaginary time dynamics.\nGiven kl are momenta of fermions, we can determine the distribution of their\npositions xl in the large R limit using a semiclassical approach. To do this, we consider the phase space distribution (Wigner function) W0(x, k), which for free fermions has a very simple structure: W0(x, k) = 1 in the region filled with particles and W0(x, k) = 0 in the region filled with holes, so one only needs to know the shape of the boundary separating these regions. The latter is nothing but the solution of Eq. (17) for real x and k, i.e. this boundary is a real section of the complex curve. It is natural to postulate the Wigner function in the form\nW0(x, k) = 1\n\u03c0 Im logF0(x, k) . (34)\nThe normalisation (12) implies that x is the coordinate of fermions measured in units of R. For real but sign changing function F0(x, k) the implicit equation Eq. (17) gives the boundary of the occupied portion of the phase space.\nGenerally speaking, the boundary separating particles from holes in phase space\nmay consist of a number of curves encircling disconnected regions in the phase space, but we do not consider this possibility here. In our case, there is only one connected region in the phase space, and Eq. (17) defines a two-valued analytic function X(k) with a single branch cut along the interval Ik. The distribution \u03c3(k) is given by the jump across the cut:\n\u03c3(k) = 1\n2 [X+(k)\u2212X\u2212(k)] , (35)\nwhere X\u00b1(k) = X(k\u2213i\u03b5). Physically, these two solutions represent the distance between the most remote right and left fermions. As particles fill uniformly the region between X\u2212(k) and X+(k), the above expression for \u03c3(k) is equivalent to\n\u03c3(k) = 1\n2 \u222b X+ X\u2212 W0(x, k) dx . (36)\nConversely, resolving Eq. (17) for k = K(x) gives again a two-valued function with\nbranches K\u00b1(x) which can be interpreted as local Fermi points, so their difference is proportional to the real space density of fermions,\n\u03c1(x) = \u222b K+ K\u2212 dk 2\u03c0 W0(x, k) = 1 2\u03c0 [K+(x)\u2212K\u2212(x)] . (37)\nThese considerations are illustrated in Fig. 2.\nThis semiclassical picture can be extended to arbitrary \u03c4 by making the ballistic\nshift Eq. (33) in the complex curve. In contrast to Eq. (17), the function F\u03c4 (x, k) is complex, so the requirement of vanishing of its real and imaginary parts constitute a system of two equations for two unknowns: the density \u03c1(x, \u03c4) = (k + k\u0304)/2\u03c0 and the velocity v(x, \u03c4) = (k \u2212 k\u0304)/2i. Solving Eq. (33) for fixed real x, \u03c4 gives space-time information about density and velocity configurations which can otherwise be viewed as a mapping between space-time (x, \u03c4) and a surface parametrised by local coordinates\n(\u03c1, v). Finding the shape of such a surface can be formulated as a minimisation problem leading to complex Burgers equations for combinations k, k\u0304 = \u03c0\u03c1 \u00b1 iv of the hydrodynamic fields. In the presence of nontrivial boundary conditions imposed at the endpoints of the time interval, the limit shape phenomenon is expected [26]. In the next section, we obtain and characterize the limit shapes across GWW phase transition."

In terms of the variable z = eik = ei\u03c0\u03c1\u2212v the equation F\u03c4 (x, k) = 0 is a quartic equation and has four solutions. Moreover, owing to the symmetry of the spectral curve Eq. (33) if z is a solution then z\u0304 is also a solution, thus the solutions are either real corresponding to \u03c1 = 0, 1 or there is a complex conjugate pair of solutions corresponding to k = \u03c0\u03c1+iv and \u2212k\u0304 = \u2212\u03c0\u03c1 + iv with 0 < \u03c1 < 1. The former, real case, corresponds to the frozen regions while in the latter case the point (x, \u03c4) lies within the fluctuating (aka liquid) region.\nAs the point (x, \u03c4) approaches the boundary of the fluctuating region two solutions\nz = eik, z\u0304 = e\u2212ik\u0304 move toward each other and coalesce on the real axis when the boundary is reached. If this happens for Re z > 0 then k = \u2212k\u0304 = iv and the point (x, \u03c4) is on the boundary of the empty frozen region, \u03c1 = 0. For two solutions meeting on the negative segment of the real axis, Re z < 0, the point (x, \u03c4) reaches the boundary with the fully occupied frozen region, \u03c1 = 1. The condition to have degenerate solutions is\n\u2202kF\u03c4 (x, k) = 0 . (38)\nImposing it in addition to Eq. (33) and solving for k = iv or k = \u03c0 + iv leads to the parametric form of the boundary of a frozen region,\nx\u2212 V (v)\u03c4 = G(v) , (39) \u2212\u2202vV (v)\u03c4 = \u2202vG(v) , (40)\nwhere for the boundary of the empty region V (v) = \u2212i\u03b5\u2032(iv) = sinh v and G(v) \u2261 X(iv) is a solution of Eq. (17) with k = iv. The boundary of the fully occupied frozen region, \u03c1 = 1, is obtained from Eqs. (39),(40) by substituting G(v) = X(\u03c0 + iv), V (v) = \u2212i\u03b5\u2032(\u03c0+iv) = \u2212 sinh v. This transformation k \u2192 k+\u03c0 amounts to the particlehole conjugation. Since Eq. (17) has two solutions for X, the boundary of fluctuating regions consists of two outer curves separating it from the frozen empty regions and two inner boundaries separating it from the full frozen region.\nEqs. (39,40) determine boundaries of liquid regions (see Fig. 3). It was shown that\nthis method known as the \u201ctangent method\u201d allows to find the shape of liquid regions even in the presence of short-range interactions [27]. The essence of this method is the fact that the boundary curve x(\u03c4) and the function G(v) are related by the generalised\nLegendre transform\nG(v) = x\u2212 V (v)\u03c4 , dx d\u03c4 = V (v) . (41)\nFor free fermions this allows to recover the function G(v) and, consequently, the function\nF0(x, k) from the explicit form of the boundaries x(\u03c4).\nBy fixing a point (x, \u03c4) inside the frozen region one can solve Eq. (39) geometrically\nby finding the slope v(x, \u03c4) of the line tangential to the frozen boundary passing through (x, \u03c4) as shown in Fig. 3. Since there are typically more than one such lines, the function v(x, \u03c4) is multivalued (quadruple-valued in our case). For (x, \u03c4) close enough to the boundary, two points of tangency approach each other, and so do their slopes. Once (x, \u03c4) reaches the boundary, the two points of tangency coalesce, and their slopes degenerate. This geometric scenario is equivalent to our earlier statement about coalescing roots.\nAs one moves inside the fluctuating region, two solutions z = eik, e\u2212ik\u0304 leave the real\naxis symmetrically and \u03c1 begins to evolve from its frozen value. Solving F\u03c4 (x, k) = 0 for k at fixed (x, \u03c4) provides the density and velocity profiles. Below we illustrate the boundaries of the fluctuating regions and calculate the density and velocity profiles for \u03bb > 1 and \u03bb < 1, which in the standard nomenclature of Refs. [9, 10] are called strong and weak coupling phases, respectively.\nFrom our geometric perspective, a more intuitive designation for these phases is\nmore appropriate. Indeed, looking at density profiles shown in Fig. 4 one sees that the main feature of these solutions is that for \u03bb > 1, the liquid regions are completely separated by the frozen boundary, while for \u03bb < 1 the liquid regions merge. In the following, we use the names of separated and merged phases for \u03bb > 1 and \u03bb < 1, respectively. The critical value \u03bbc = 1 of the control parameter corresponds to the Merger Transition."

This leads to \u03c4 = \u2213 tanh v, x = \u00b1(\u03bb + 1/ cosh v) which is the parametric equation of the outer half circles centered at \u00b1\u03bb.

Some analytic progress can be made in the regime of small v, including the interesting central region, which we explore in more detail in the next section. Here we just mention that while for the outer boundaries, adjacent to the empty frozen region, \u03c1 = 0, the function \u03c4(v) remains smooth, the solution for the inner boundary curve leads to \u03c4(v) undergoing a discontinuity at v = 0.

We call it the Merger Transition and study it by expanding Eq. (33) in the vicinity of (x, \u03c4) = (0, 0) in small deviations q = \u03c0 \u2212 k = \u03c0\u03b4\u03c1+ iv 1. It is convenient at this stage to restore the macroscopic length and time scales, which is equivalent to rescaling x \u2192 x/R, \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4/R in Eq. (33). The approximate complex curve (33)\n(x\u2212 i\u03c4q)2 = ( x0 + q2\n2g\n)2 \u2212m2R2 (48)\ndepends on two parameters with the geometric meaning discussed below. The density profile obtained from this equation is shown in Fig. 6. Below we discuss the prominent features of this solution.\nWe consider the frozen boundary first. In the separated phase m = 0 and\nsubstituting \u03b4\u03c1 = 0 into Eq. (48) we have the boundary in the parametric form x = \u00b1 ( x0 + v2\n2g\n) , \u03c4 = \u00b1v/g . (49)\nEliminating v leads to the boundary consisting of two parabolae, x = \u00b1 ( x0 + g\u03c4 2\n2\n) . (50)\nClose to the boundaries the density deviates from 1 as square root of the distance to\nthe boundary into the liquid phase, i.e. for \u03c4 = 0 we have for the right region (x > x0)\n\u03b4\u03c1 =\n\u221a 2g\n\u03c0 (x\u2212 x0)1/2 , x & x0 , (51)\nand velocity keeps its value v = \u2212g\u03c4 away from the boundary. The parameters x0 and g have the clear geometric meaning of half the distance between the frozen boundaries, and their curvature. In terms of the right hand side of Eq. (39) x0 = RG(0) = L\u2212R and g\u22121 = RG\u2032\u2032(0) = R. The shape (50) is valid for x0 > 0 and describes the boundaries of the central frozen isthmus between two fluctuating regions. Decreasing x0 leads to the isthmus thinning out until its two boundaries touch at the transition x0 = 0.\nFor x0 < 0 the curve Eq. (50) corresponds to the unphysical situation of overlapping\nliquid regions with double valued density profile. To rectify this situation one has to modify the right hand side of Eq. (48) by positive order parameter m = |x0|/R. This gives\nx+ v\u03c4 = \u2213 \u221a( x0 \u2212 v2\n2g\n)2 \u2212m2R2 = \u2213v\u03c40 \u221a 1 + ( v\nv0\n)2 , (52)\nwhere \u03c40 = \u221a |x0|/g is the characteristic time and v0 = 2|x0|/\u03c40 is the characteristic velocity scale. The degeneracy condition, Eq. (40), leads to\n\u03c4 = \u2213\u03c40 1 + 2\n( v v0 )2 \u221a\n1 + ( v v0 )2 . (53) This equation does not have real solutions for \u2212\u03c40 < \u03c4 < \u03c40. This is the interval in which there is no separation of the two liquid regions and its endpoints (0,\u00b1\u03c40) correspond to the boundary cusps. The presence of such a liquid region between arctic curves is the characteristic feature of the merged phase. Tuning x0 to zero from below makes the cusps approach each other so that the width of the liquid \u201cchannel\u201d behaves as |x0|1/2. At the Merger Transition, x0 = 0, the cusps touch each other, and the channel connecting the liquid regions closes.\nThe solution of Eq. (53) for |\u03c4 | > \u03c40 gives the boundary velocity\nv(\u03c4) = \u00b1v0\u03a5 ( \u03c4\n\u03c40\n) (54)\nin terms of the universal function\n\u03a5(s) = 1\n2\n\u221a s2\n2 \u2212 2 +\n\u221a 2s2 + s4\n4 , (55)\nwhich has a square root singularity as s approaches 1 from above. Substitution of (54) into (52) gives the universal shape of the boundary below the Merger Transition\nx(\u03c4) = \u00b12|x0| \u03a53 ( \u03c4 \u03c40 ) \u221a\n1 + \u03a52 ( \u03c4 \u03c40 ) , (56) which behaves near the tips of the boundary cusps as\nx(\u03c4) = \u00b18|x0| 3 \u221a 6\n( \u03c4 \u03c40 \u2212 1 )3/2 . (57)\nThis behaviour is identical to the standard singularity of a mapping of a two-\ndimensional surface onto a plane known as cusp in Whitney classification [30, 31]. Expanding the right hand side of Eq. (52) for v v0 gives, for the positive sign choice, the canonical form at the cusp singularity\nx\n|x0| =\n( v\nv0\n)3 + 2 ( 1\u2212 \u03c4\n\u03c40\n)( v\nv0\n) . (58)\nHere one regards (v, x, \u03c4) as three dimensional coordinates of a two-dimensional surface projected along the v-direction onto the plane (x, \u03c4). The choice of the negative sign in Eq. (52) leads to another surface with another Whitney cusp at \u03c4 = \u2212\u03c40. For |\u03c4 | > \u03c40 the boundaries x(\u03c4) are folds in Whitney classification [30]. In the limit \u03c4 \u03c40 one recovers the parabolic shape Eq. (50) of the boundary. Note that as x0 is negative, the large \u03c4 asymptotics are reproduced by the \u201cnaive\u201d shift of the frozen boundary, namely Eq. (50) with x0 < 0, shown by dashed lines in Fig. 6. The complex curve (52) and the resulting function (55) interpolate nicely between the cusp and fold singularities.\nIn the merged phase the density profile for \u03c4 = 0 becomes\n\u03b4\u03c1 =\n\u221a 2g\n\u03c0\n(\u221a x20 + x 2 + |x0| )1/2 , (59)\nwhich has minimum value \u03b4\u03c1min = 2 \u221a g|x0|/\u03c0. Across the narrow strait between the two macroscopic liquid regions, x = 0, \u2212\u03c40 < \u03c4 < \u03c40, the density depletion has a semicircle shape,\n\u03b4\u03c1 = 2g\n\u03c0 \u221a |x0| g \u2212 \u03c4 2 .

In particular, the time reversal symmetry guarantees the reality of the coefficients in the rhs of (61) and the parity symmetry makes sure that the rhs is a function of q2. Therefore, based only on the analyticity of X(q) and the symmetries (62,63) we could write\nX2 = a(q2 + \u03b41)(q 2 + \u03b42) (64)\nas the most general algebraic solution up to order q4.

On one side of the phase transition we should have separate liquid regions which is equivalent to the conditions a > 0, \u03b4 \u2261 \u03b41 = \u03b42 > 0. In this case we have X = \u00b1 \u221a a(q2 + \u03b4) describing two separate liquid regions corresponding to the choice of sign (see the left panel of Fig. 6). When \u03b4 = 0 the boundaries of liquid regions touch. For the merged phase, one can consider the density and current profiles corresponding to (64). Since the flux of particles j \u223c \u03c1v = Im q2 must be zero for x = 0 by symmetry, the spectral curve should have real roots for all \u03c4 . In addition \u03c1 \u223c Re q should vanish for \u03c4 > \u03c40. The only possibility for this to happen is the one corresponding to \u03b41 = \u03b4 < 0 and \u03b42 = 0 (and the identical solution with \u03b41,2 exchanged). That is X2 = aq2(q2 + 2\u03b4) (see the right panel of Fig. 6). We summarize\nall cases as\nX2/a =  (q2 + \u03b4)2 , \u03b4 > 0 , q4 , \u03b4 = 0 ,\nq2(q2 + 2\u03b4) , \u03b4 < 0 .\n(65)\nIn the particular model considered in this paper a = 1/4, \u03b4 = 2(\u03bb\u2212 1). The phase transition is driven by the real parameter \u03b4. During the transition, the type of complex curve changes as summarized in (65). As we explained above, the transition- in the shape of the curve is essentially fixed by requirements of (i) parity and time-reversal symmetries of the fermion dispersion (Hamiltonian) and boundary conditions (ii) the requirement of the least possible number of singularities. The latter requirement forces (65) to be the quadratic polynomial in q2 with either degenerate roots or having one of the roots at 0.\nWe remark that we expect (65) to capture the universal dependence of density and\nvelocity of fermions near the merging point. Indeed, assume that there is an interaction between fermions which preserves P and T symmetries of the Hamiltonian (for example, fermions corresponding to XXZ spin chain). Then, near the point of the merger of two liquid regions, the density of fermions is small (or close to 1). In this limit, the interaction is negligible, and the solution of hydrodynamic equations is still captured by a complex curve X(q). Symmetries will then fix the form of (65) as a universal curve that changes across the phase transition."

For sufficiently small |x0|, x0 < 0 the overlap of two arctic curves computed naively has x dimension 2|x0| and \u03c4 dimension 2 \u221a 2|x0|/g with the area of the overlap scaling as A \u223c g\u22121/2|x0|3/2, see Fig. 6. The depletion of the density at point (0, 0) is equal to \u03b4\u03c1 = 2(g|x0|)1/2/\u03c0. The change of the energy (per unit length) because of the depletion is \u03b4E \u223c \u03b4\u03c1\u00d7 \u03b4\u03c12 \u223c \u03b4\u03c13 \u223c g3/2|x0|3/2.

Similarly to the situation at the edge of an interacting system [32] the precise relation between the parameter g controlling the scale of typical boundary fluctuations and the global parameters of the limiting shape is model specific and depends on interaction details."

            "text": "In this work, we considered an example of a phase transition of the third order in a system characterized by a limit shape phenomenon. The transition is a merger of two liquid (fluctuating) regions controlled by a geometric parameter defined by boundary conditions. We used a free fermion formulation of the problem and mapped the transition to the well-known transition in the Gross-Witten-Wadia model [9, 10].\nIn the Coulomb gas picture of the transition developed in [9, 10] the transition is the\nchange of the support of the density of the Coulomb gas. In a complex plane, the support changes from the whole unit circle to just an arc of the circle. [Compare to similar Coulomb gas transitions described in the Ref. [16].] Using the path integral of 1d lattice fermions propagating in imaginary time, we extended this picture to space-time. The optimal space-time configuration of fermions dominating the path integral exhibits the limit shape phenomenon. Namely, the space-time is divided into liquid regions, where fermion density is between 0 and 1, and frozen regions with \u03c1 = 0, 1. At the change of the geometric control parameter entering through the boundary conditions, two liquid regions (arctic circles) separated by a frozen region merge into a single connected liquid region (see Fig. 4). At the value of the geometric parameter corresponding to the transition, the liquid regions touch. Within the mean-field approximation valid in the thermodynamic limit when the sizes of liquid regions are much bigger than the lattice size, we compute the optimal space-time distributions of the density and velocity of fermions at both sides of the transition. We note that for a finite size (finite N), the transition is somewhat smeared by statistical fluctuations. The character of these fluctuations near the boundaries of liquid regions and, in particular, near the point of the merger is a subject of intense studies (see [14, 13] and reference therein).\nIt is well known that hydrodynamic solutions of free fermion problems can be\ndescribed by an analytic function (complex curve) [1, 2]. Zooming into the vicinity of the merger, one can describe the transition as a change of the complex curve. Namely, we find that the curve changes according to (65) when the control parameter \u03b4 passes through its critical value \u03b4 = 0. We argued that this change of the curve is universal, assuming that additional symmetries (parity and time-reversal) are present. The universal density profiles on both sides of the transition are shown in Fig. 6. Using the mapping to the GWW model, in the considered free fermion problem, one can also compute the free energy exactly and identify the phase transition as the third-order. We finally remark that as j = 0 at x = 0, found from the symmetries of the problem, we could reformulate our problem equivalently as a single arctic circle which comes up against a boundary.\nA natural question one can ask is whether the features of the merger phase transition\ndescribed above are universal in the presence of interactions between fermions. The answer depends on the symmetries of the system. To be more specific, let us consider an example of XXZ quantum spin chain. The Jordan-Wigner transformation maps the XXZ spin chain to fermions with short-range interactions, and one can consider the\namplitude (1) for these fermions as a function of L. The qualitative picture of the merger of two liquid regions stays the same, at least for small anisotropy parameter \u2206 when the interaction between fermions is weak (see Ref.[8]). The symmetries of the problem include parity, time-reversal, and particle-hole symmetry. Near the point of merger, the fermion density is small or close to 1. If the fermion density is close to 1, it can be mapped to small density using particle-hole symmetry of the problem. In the limit of small density, the fermions with short-range interactions become indistinguishable from free fermions. Therefore, we expect that in the neighborhood of the space-time point where the merger occurs, one can still use a complex curve to describe the fermion density and velocity profiles. [In fact one can use complex curves to describe the whole segments of the boundary of the frozen region [27].] Then one can use parity and timereversal symmetry to argue for the universal shape of the curve (65). This means that only the parameters such as the effective mass in X = x + iq\u03c4/m, the relationship of the control parameter \u03b4 to parameters of boundary conditions, and overall scales will depend on details of the model. Up to the values of these parameters, the density and velocity profiles near the merger will be determined by the universal curve (65).\nOne more feature that needs a discussion is the order of the phase transition. In the\npresence of interactions, there is no free fermion description (or Coulomb gas picture) describing the field distributions in the liquid region globally. This is why only the boundary of the region [27] and the vicinity of the merger point allowed an analytical treatment so far. However, we argued in Sec. 6.2 that the contribution of the vicinity of the merger to the free energy has a discontinuity in the third derivative with respect to the control parameter \u03b4. Assuming that the contribution of the regions far from the merger point is analytic in \u03b4, we conjecture that the phase transition is of the third order even in the presence of finite interactions.\nThe above arguments can be summarized by a conjecture that there is a (possibly\nsymmetry-protected) universality class of the third-order phase transitions occurring at the merger of liquid regions in systems exhibiting limit shape phenomena. To confirm (or disprove) this conjecture, further analytical and numerical studies of systems such as XXZ spin chains or six-vertex models are needed.\nIn conclusion we add that the real-time analog of (1) has been considered in [33]. In\nthis context, the quantity (1) is referred to as quantum return probability (aka Loschmidt echo). The discontinuity or change of behaviour of the quantum return probability found in [33] can be attributed to the merging arctic circles phase transition considered in this work."
