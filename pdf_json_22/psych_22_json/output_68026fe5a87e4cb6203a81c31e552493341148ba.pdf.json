Objectives: Our objective is to examine the usability of a VR embodiment tool for treating obesity. Methods: Fourteen participants (6 healthy and 8 with morbid obesity) with a desire to make lifestyle changes were randomly assigned to the experimental group (EG) and the control group (CG). Participants from the EG engaged in a virtual selfconversation aiming at understanding their own motivation to make lifestyle changes. Using the body swapping technique, participants were embodied alternately in their own virtual representation and in their counsellor\u2019s body. To better guide this virtual selfconversation, participants were previously trained on MI skills. Participants from the CG were embodied in their own virtual bodies and participated in a \u201cscripted dialogue\u201d with a virtual counsellor who gave them practical recommendations about how to achieve lifestyle changes. A mixed-methods design was used, involving a semi-structured interview examining users\u00b4 satisfaction with the virtual experience, as well as self-report questionnaires, including readiness to change habits, body ownership, and system usability. Results: Participants showed high usability of the platform with higher scores among participants from the EG compared to the CG. Levels of body ownership were satisfactory, with no differences between groups. Conclusions:Through the integration ofMI in the VR context with the patient being properly trained to carry out his/her own\nmotivational self-conversation, we will provide an important advance in the psychological treatments of obesity.\nDisclosure: This project has received funding from the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 951930 Keywords: Motivational Interview; obesity; embodiment; virtual reality\nEPV0681\nPRESTOapp for health workers with mental health symptoms related to the COVID-19 pandemic\nM.

Objectives: (1) To adapt and enhance a smartphone app (PRESTOapp) for health workers with mental health symptoms related to the COVID-19, and (2) to demonstrate its potential effectiveness in significantly reducing anxiety-depressive and PTSD symptoms in this population. We aim to incorporate Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based techniques in a chatbot userinterface that will enable a more personalized and accurate monitoring and intervention. Methods: An 18-months study with a 6-months preliminary phase to adapt PRESTOapp to health workers, enhance it withNLP-based techniques and chatbot user-interface, and evaluate its feasibility, and effectiveness in 12-months. Results: PRESTOapp has the potential to provide a prompt, personalized and integral response to themental health demand due to the COVID-19. It will help by providing an innovative digital platform, that will allow remote monitoring of the symptoms course, provide brief psychotherapeutic interventions, and detect urgent situations. If the preliminary results of this study point to a potential effectiveness of the intervention, PRESTOapp may be easily adapted to the general population. Conclusions: PRESTOapp may be one of the key digital platforms that may help preventing and treating potentially severe mental health consequences. Considering the unresolved problem of burnout in health workers even before the COVID-19, this project will develop the necessary technology for implementing cost-effective mental health solutions, not only during the pandemic.\nDisclosure: No significant relationships.
