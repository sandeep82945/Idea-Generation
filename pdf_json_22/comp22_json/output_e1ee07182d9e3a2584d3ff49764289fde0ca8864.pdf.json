INTRODUCTION\nD IGITAL beamforming arrays are an enabler to the 5Grevolution. The increased number of users necessitates switching to higher frequencies with a large number of frequency bands, this includes the 24-40GHZ band. The increasing number of bands in the mmWave spectrum mandates advanced circuit techniques to deal with the challenges associated with the high frequency and the large number of users. These challenges include linearity, interference mitigation, bandwidth, and other concerns. Due to the large number of users and antennas in MIMO systems, the use of digital beamforming arrays makes the linearity requirement more stringent but relaxes the noise figure requirement. This makes mixerfirst receiver an attractive candidate for digital beamforming arrays because of their high linearity and their moderate noise figure.\nFig. 1 shows a conventional 4-phase passive mixer-first receiver driven by non-overlapping LO waveform. Traditionally, matching is done using the transparency property of Npath filters. Instead of using a shunt resistor, which will add a 3dB penalty to the noise figure, matching is done using miller\u2019s \u2019s effect with the feedback resistor of the baseband amplifier. Using miller\u2019s \u2019s effect, the impedance looking into the receiver from the antenna is equal to:\nZin = \u03b3Rf\n(1 +A) (1)\nA high linearity mixer-first receiver for digital mmWave beamforming arrays was proposed in [1]. Fig. 2.a shows the schematic of the highly linear receiver. The work achieves\nThe authors are with the Berkeley Wireless Research Center, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, 94704 USA (email:raalkubaisy@berkeley.edu).\nin-band IIP3 that are 16dB higher than the state-of-the-art passive mixer-first receivers. Instead of using miller\u2019s effect of the feedback resistor of the baseband amplifier for matching, matching is done with a 50\u2126 physical resistor. The design uses feedback linearization to improve the linearity of the receiver.\nFeedback linearization is achieved by designing a baseband amplifier with a large open loop gain, making the voltage at the input of the baseband amplifier a virtual ground. The large loop gain of the baseband amplifier would make the impedance looking into the baseband amplifier small and reducing the\nar X\niv :2\n21 2.\n03 16\n2v 1\n[ ee\nss .S\nY ]\n6 D\nec 2\n02 2\n2 swing at the input of the amplifier. The small input swing would translate to less distortion caused by the baseband amplifier. Fig. 2.b shows an illustration of that where Vx is chosen to be approximately zero by design.\nThe noise figure of the design ranges from 12.5dB to 15.7dB for fRF that ranges from 10GHZ to 30GHz. The noise figure is high due to several factors. The use of the 50\u2126 resistors adds a 3.1dB penalty to the noise figure. Additionally, charge sharing plays a large role in degrading the noise figure of receivers with overlapping local LO waveform. Synthesizing 25% dutycycle LO Waveform at microwave and mmWave frequencies is challenging. Hence, a 50% duty-cycle LO is used in this design instead. The overlap of LO waveform results in charge sharing between the I and Q paths which will degrade the noise figure. The authors in [1] proposed using 50\u2126 resistors in all of the mixers\u2019 paths, instead of one 50\u2126 resistor to reduce the charge sharing. Although the addition of the resistors on all of the paths helped reduce charge sharing, the resistors would only reduce charge sharing current and not filter it out. On the other hand, the addition of resistors on all paths increased the parasitic capacitance leading to more loss in the signal path, and a further degradation in the noise figure.\nThis paper is organized as follows. Section II explores a narrowband mixer-first receiver design using a modified version of the Wilkinson divider. Section III explores the use of L-matching networks in the receiver including a tunable matching network for wideband applications. Section IV discuss the circuit implementation of the wideband receiver discussed in section III and the post-layout simulations. Section VI compares this work against other mixer-first receivers and provides the takeaway and possible way to improve the design."

With the help of quarter-wavelength transmission lines, the small value for on-resistance of the mixers\u2019 can be transformed to a larger value to match the antenna. Fig. 3 shows the schematic of this design. The quarter-wavelength transmission lines structure is similar to Wilkinson Divider but without the bridge resistor.\nImpedance matching can be achieved by choosing the width of the transmission line such that its characteristic impedance is\nZ0 = \u221a 2RswRS (2)\nthis makes the impedance looking into one transmission line, which is either the I or the Q paths, equal to\nZTline1 = Z20 Rsw = 2RswRs Rsw = 2RS (3)\nAnd the input impedance looking into the receiver is\nZin = 2RS ||2RS = RS (4)\n\u2212\n+\nRf\n\u2212\n+\nRf\n\u2212\n+\nRf\n\u2212\n+\nRf\nOut+I\nOut\u2212I\nOut+Q\nOut\u2212Q\n270\u25e6\n180\u25e6\n0\u25e6\n90\u25e6\nR\u2032S\nR\u2032S\nR\u2032S\nR\u2032S\nRS\nVS\nCBB\nCBB\nCBB\nCBB\nLO0\u25e6\nLO90\u25e6\nLO180\u25e6\nLO270\u25e6\n(a)\nThe addition of the quarter-wavelength transmission lines will provide isolation between the I and the Q paths of the receiver. This means that the charge sharing current that is caused by the overlapping LO waveform will be reduced. To achieve the same linearity measurements as in [1], this design uses feedback linearization proposed in [1] and discussed in section I to mitigate the effect of the baseband distortion on the receiver\u2019s overall linearity. Feedback linearization means choosing a large open loop gain for the baseband amplifier which would result in a smaller voltage swing at the input of the baseband amplifier.\nFig. 4 shows the simulation results of the design. There is a 4.7dB improvement in the noise figure compared to the 50\u2126 resistors design proposed in [1] at 20GHz. Fig. 5 also shows the simulated noise figure values for the same design with transmission lines designed for 30GHz with a 6.1dB improvement in noise figure. The higher frequency means a shorter length for the quarter-wavelength transmission lines, less loss in the signal path, and an improved noise figure.\nUsing transmission lines in a mixer-first receivers significantly improved the noise figure of the linear receiver proposed\n3 \u2212\n+\nRf\n\u2212\n+\nRf\n\u2212\n+\nRf\n\u2212\n+\nRf\nOut+I\nOut\u2212I\nOut+Q\nOut\u2212Q\n270\u25e6\n180\u25e6\n0\u25e6\n90\u25e6\nRS\nVS\n\u03bb/4\n\u03bb/4\nCBB\nCBB\nCBB\nCBB\nFig. 3: Mixer-first Receiver with Modified Wilkinson Divider\nin [1]. But the use of transmission lines is limited due to several factors. At 20GHz, the required length of a quarterwavelength transmission line is about 2mm. This means that the design will consume a large area and will not be practical. Additionally, this receiver design can only be used for narrowband applications since matching will only be achieved at a single frequency."

The design still uses the on-resistance of the mixers\u2019 for matching, but the quarterwavelength transmission lines are replaced with a passive L-matching network. The matching network will behave as an artificial quarter-wavelength transmission lines and it will transform the on-resistance of the mixers to match the 50\u2126 resistance of the antenna. Fig. 6 shows a schematic of the receiver with the passive matching network. The matching network is used on both the I and the Q paths, and it behaves as a low-pass filter to isolate the I and Q paths by filtering the charge sharing current between the two paths due to the overlapping LO waveform. It consists of a shunt cap at the input and a series inductor. This configuration is chosen as opposed to the capacitor in series and a shunt inductor because the series inductor would provide filtering to the charge sharing current, which is a technique proposed in [2]. The use of an Lmatching network is an improvement from the previous design because a 2 mm transmission line is no longer needed, which puts less constraint on the area.\n10 15 20 25 30 35 5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n4.75dB\nFrequency [GHz]\nN oi\nse Fi\ngu re\n[d B\n]\nRx W/ 50\u2126 resistor Rx W/ Tlines\nFig. 4: Noise figure of receiver with a 50\u2126 resistor and receiver with a \u03bb/4 transmission line designed for 20GHz\n10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 5 6 7 8 9\n10 11 12 13 14 15 16\n6.37dB\nFrequency [GHz]\nN oi\nse Fi\ngu re\n[d B\n]\nRx W/ 50\u2126 resistor Rx W/ Tlines\nFig. 5: Noise figure of receiver with a 50\u2126 resistor and receiver with a \u03bb/4 transmission line designed for 30GHz\nFig. 7 shows the simulation results of the three receiver designs.

Fig. 8 shows the schematic of the receiver with the tunable matching network. The variable capacitor can be implemented with either a varactor or a capacitor bank. The tunability of the inductor is more difficult to realize since inductors occupy larger amounts of area and implementing an inductor bank would be area consuming.

            "heading": "B. Linearity",
            "text": "The linearity of the receiver is governed by linearity of the mixers and the baseband amplifier. This can be seen by analyzing the overall IIP3 of the receiver which is given with the following equation:\n1\nV 2IIP3 = a2MN V 2IIP3,mixer + a2MNa 2 mixers V 2IIP3,BB (6)\nThe gain of a 4-phase mixers, amixers, is approximately 1. The voltage gain of the matching network, aMN , is less than unity, which means that the IIP3 of the mixers is effectively increased. The linearity limit imposed by the baseband amplifier is mitigated by using feedback linearization, which is a\n5 technique previously proposed in [1]. By choosing a large open loop gain of the baseband amplifier, the input of the baseband amplifier can be nearly a virtual ground. This can be visualized in Fig. 10, where Vx would be almost zero by design. Making the input of the baseband amplifier\u2019s a virtual ground means that input swing to the baseband amplifier is minimized which limits the effect of the baseband non-linearity on the receiver\u2019s overall linearity.\nAs for the mixer\u2019s linearity, the large gain of the baseband amplifier means that source terminal of the mixer, which is the input to the baseband amplifier, is a virtual ground. This will reduce the Vgs swing of the mixers making them more linear. This concept is similar to \u201dbottom-plate\u201d mixers discussed in [3].\nThe linearity limit imposed by the mixers\u2019 Vds swing is mitigated by stepping down the input voltage with the matching network and using a smaller on-resistance for the mixers. Fig. 10 shows a simplified schematic of the receiver and the effect of using the matching network on Vds of the mixers. Assuming that the matching network is ideal, the output power of both matching networks will be\nPout = Pin 2\n(7)\nThe power at the input, Pin, can be expressed as\nPin = V 2in 2Rs\n(8)\nAnd the output power of the matching network can be expressed as\nPout = V 2ds\n2Rsw (9)\nSolving for Vds in terms of Vin by plugging 9 and 8 into 7:\nVds = vs 2 \u221a Rsw 2Rs\n(10)\nWith Rsw = 12\u2126 and Rs = 50\u2126:\nVds = vs 2 \u221a Rsw 2Rs = vs 2 \u221a 12 100 = 0.17Vs (11)\nThe expression of Vds shows that for smaller Rsw, the drain source voltage swing will decrease making the receiver more linear. A smaller Vds results in a more linear mixer. The reduction of the Vds swing across the mixer would not be the limiting factor in the receiver linearity."

The presence of high frequency LO harmonics means that interferes at those frequencies will be down converted to baseband, degrading the signal-to-noise ratio at the output and the receiver\u2019s noise figure. The matching network between the antenna and the mixer acts as a low-pass filter. Interferes at the LO harmonics will be attenuated before getting down converted to baseband. This will improve the signal-to-noise ratio at the output and will improve the noise figure as opposed to the design in [1]. The filtering effect makes this receiver architecture a harmonic rejection receiver. Unlike conventional harmonic rejection receivers, the tunable nature of the matching network allows for wideband operation.\n6 VDD\nVbias\nRfRf\nFig. 12: Inverter-based Baseband amplifier\nFig. 13: Schematic of the LO Chain [5]\nIn addition to being a harmonic rejection receiver, the matching network works as a filter for the current flowing from the mixers to the antenna. In equation 12, [4] showed that Rsh is due to the power losses resulting from the up-conversion of the LO harmonics to the antenna. Rsh can be expressed as the parallel combination of the antenna\u2019s impedance at the odd harmonics of the LO. Since the matching network is a low pass filter, the impedance looking at the antenna from the mixers side would be large.\nThe large value of Rsh would translate to less loss in the receiver and that would improve the noise figure. Equation 12 shows how with increasing Rsh, the term where Rsh appears would tend to zero with increasing Rsh\n2) Charge Sharing: In addition to being part of the matching network, the series inductor in the matching network offers another benefit. the inductor provides filtering to the charge sharing current the I and Q paths. This will consequently improve the noise figure of the receiver. The use of an inductor is also reported in [2] to reduce charge sharing.\nIn equation (include equation), ROL is used to model the effect of the overlapping LO waveform. ROL is proportional to the resistance per path of the N-path filter and inversely proportional to the overlap time between the LO waveform. ROL is infinite when 25% duty-cycle LO waveform is used. ROL can be approximated using the following equation:\nROL \u221d Rpath\n\u03c9LO\u03c4overlap (13)"

Choosing a large device would make the on-resistance of the mixer smaller, improving the noise figure. The simulation results showed a 0.3dB improvement in the noise figure when using a switch with on-resistance 6\u2126 instead of 12\u2126. The mixers\u2019 are driven by an ideal voltage source with overlapping waveforms.\nThe larger transistor size means that the gate capacitance of the mixers will be larger, making it more difficult to drive the mixers with a reasonable power consumption. The larger mixers also mean adding more parasitic capacitance to the input of the mixer, leading to more loss in the signal path and further degradation in the noise figure. Hence, the final design uses switches with W/L = 27 \u00b5m/30 nm instead of a larger device size, with on-resistance of 12\u2126."

            "text": "This paper proposed multiple designs for linear mixer-first receivers. Post-layout simulations showed an improvement in noise figure values compared to the design proposed in [1]. The final design achieved a noise figure of less than 8dB from a frequency range of 25GHz to 40GHz, and an IIP3 of +3.6dBm to +4.2dBm across the frequency range. Table I shows a comparison between the proposed design and the state-of-the-art mixer-first receiver greater than 25GHz. The noise figure value are lower than the other reported noise figure values. Although the IIP3 numbers are lower compared to the values reported in [1], the values are improved compared to the other designs listed. The in-band IP3 values of the receiver can be improved by using a baseband amplifier with a large open loop gain. The larger amplifier gain would minimize the swing at the input of the baseband amplifier, which will consequently improve the linearity of the receiver. Improving the LO Chain will deliver a better LO waveform which would help with the linearity of the switch and the overall performance of the receiver.\nSwitching to a different process will help with the performance limitation associated with using CMOS process. Using Fully Depleted Silicon-On-Insulator process will help with the loss in the signal and will result in passives with better performance. The use of FD-SOI is also beneficial to delivering square LO Waveform which would help with the performance of the receiver."
