INTRODUCTION\nThe sixth-generation (6G) communications are expected to achieve 100\u00d7 spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) gains over the fifth-generation networks [1]. This requires a denser network infrastructure and cell-free (CF) operation that shifts the communication network from cell-centric to user-centric, to provide ubiquitous coverage, improved network throughput, and reduced energy consumption [2]\u2013[4].\nUser-centric CF massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) is a promising paradigm for increasing the average and worst-case data rates in 6G networks [5]. In CF mMIMO, a large number of distributed access points (APs), coordinated by a central processing unit (CPU), serve the user equipments (UEs) by coherent joint transmission and reception, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Due to the UE-AP-CPU architecture, the signal processing tasks can be distributed between the APs and the CPU in different ways [6], [7]. Especially, [6] applied large-scale fading decoding (LSFD), which is a two-stage decoding procedure where all APs first compute soft estimates of the data signal from all UEs and then deliver them to the CPU for final decoding. Although this approach achieves a good compromise between SE and computational complexity compared to fully centralized processing [5], it might not be energy efficient in a large network in its original form. It is unnecessary for an AP to waste power and computational resources on UEs with weak channels to it [8]. The geometry induces a sparse structure on the practically meaningful APUE associations. Prior work has suggested associating each UE with a subset of APs (typically in a heuristic non-SEoptimizing manner [9]) in advance and then excluding APs not serving this UE when computing the LSFD vector [6],\nThis work was supported in part by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant 2021YJS001 and in part by the FFL18-0277 grant from the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research.\n[9]. However, treating the AP-UE association as a separate combinatorial problem from the LSFD design, which is used to maximize the SE [6], is suboptimal. That motivates us to take the association as a part of the LSFD design and exploit sparsity methods to jointly solve the association problem.\nSparse optimization has attracted extensive research interest in the fields of signal processing, image processing, and computer vision [10]. Specific to communications, sparse optimization was applied for activity detection [11], random access [12], and node sleeping [13]. Especially, [13] turned off some \u201cunnecessary\u201d APs in a CF mMIMO network by formulating a sparse reconstruction problem. Similarly, in [4], binary programming is utilized to activate only the minimal subsets of APs for each UE to minimize the end-to-end network power consumption. Inspired by these approaches, we formulate a new sparse optimization problem that minimizes the mean-squared-error (MSE), to enforce sparsity on the LSFD coefficients. The major contributions are as follows:\n\u2022 We propose the new sparse LSFD (S-LSFD) design where\njoint AP-UE association and LSFD is achieved by formulating a sparsity-inducing MSE-minimizing problem to force small LSFD coefficients to zero. \u2022 We solve the sparsity problem by developing a proximal\nalgorithm with block-coordinate descent (BCD) that is tailored to our problem. \u2022 We compare the proposed S-LSFD, the optimal LSFD\n(O-LSFD) [6], and the partial LSFD (P-LSFD) [6] with the separate association algorithm in [9], considering the SE and EE and different combining schemes.\nNotation: Boldface lowercase letters, x, denote column vectors, boldface uppercase letters, X, denote matrices, and calligraphic uppercase letters, A, denote sets.

One choice with interference suppressing capability is the Local MMSE (L-MMSE) combining [9] given as\nvkl=pk (\u2211K i=1 pi ( h\u0302ilh\u0302 H il+Ril\u2212Bil ) + \u03c32IN )\u22121 h\u0302kl\n(5) which minimizes the local MSE E{|sk \u2212 s\u0302kl|2|{h\u0302il}}. Alternatively, maximum ratio (MR) processing scheme with vkl = h\u0302kl can be used. Note that, for UE k, although vkl 6= 0 for all APs, only the APs in Mk need to compute vkl.\nNext, all APs deliver the local data estimates to the CPU, which computes its final estimate of sk as a linear combination of the local estimates:\ns\u0302k = \u2211L\nl=1 a\u22c6kls\u0302kl = \u2211L l=1 a\u22c6klv H kly ul l , (6)\nwhere akl \u2208 C is the weight that the CPU assigns to the local signal estimate that AP l has of the signal from UE k. In LSFD, the CPU selects the weights {akl} as a deterministic function of the channel statistics (to avoid passing around channel estimates). It was introduced for CF mMIMO in [6] but was originally proposed for Cellular mMIMO [15]. Note that the user-centric architecture is determined by which variables in {akl} are non-zero, so that Mk = {l : akl 6= 0} for UE k. By letting ak = [ak1, . . . , akL]\nT \u2208 CL denote the LSFD vector of UE k and gki = [v H k1hi1, . . . ,v H kLhiL] T \u2208 CL denote the receive-combined channels between UE i and all APs, we rewrite the estimate of sk in (6) as\ns\u0302k = a H kgkksk + \u2211K\ni=1,i6=k aHkgkisi + n \u2032 k, (7)\nwhere n\u2032k = \u2211L l=1 a \u22c6 klv H klnl represents the effective noise. Although the effective channel aHkgkk is unknown at the CPU, we notice that its average E{aHkgkk} = aHkE{gkk} is deterministic and non-zero if the receive combining is selected as suggested above. Therefore, it can be assumed known and used to compute the following achievable SE."

We propose to use the sparsity-\ninducing penalty function\n\u2126(a) = \u03b3 \u2211L\nl=1 \u2016\u03b1l\u20162 + \u03bb\u2016a\u20161 (21)\nwhere \u03b1l = [a1l, . . . , aKl] T \u2208 CK is the LSFD vector related to AP l, and \u03b3 and \u03bb are tunable regularization parameters. Lager value of \u03b3 or \u03bb induces more sparsity on vector a. The first term in \u2126(a) is a \u21131/\u21132-norm regularization that behaves like a \u21131-norm applied to the vector [\u2016\u03b11\u20162, . . . , \u2016\u03b1L\u20162]T. Element l is small if AP l has little impact on the decoding and the\nregularization promotes making such values identically zero (i.e., inactivate the AP). The second term limits the number of the UEs served by the remaining active APs. We notice that (20) is convex since the \u201cMSE\u201d cost aHAa \u2212 2\u211c(aHb) and the composite norm penalty \u2126(a) are both convex functions.\nSince (20) is convex with a non-smooth sparsity-inducing penalty and separable between the APs, proximal methods with BCD can be utilized to reach the global optimum of the problem (20) [17].

Then, by using the BCD approach, we can solve (22) by iteratively minimizing a subproblem of group l while fixing the coefficients of the other groups:\nPl : min \u03b1l\u2208CK\nf(\u03b1l) + \u2126 \u2032(\u03b1l), l = 1, . . . , L, (23)\nwhere f(\u03b1l) = \u2016rl\u2212A\u0304l\u03b1l\u201622, \u2126\u2032(\u03b1l) = \u03b3\u2016\u03b1l\u20162+\u03bb\u2016\u03b1l\u20161, and rl = b\u0304 \u2212 \u2211 j 6=l A\u0304j\u03b1j is the partial residual of b\u0304 subtracting all group coefficients other than group l. \u2126\u2032(\u03b1l) implies that for group l, the other group coefficients are considered to be fixed and thus the penalties corresponding to the coefficients in these groups are ignored.

Due to the strong convexity, the unique solution of (26) can be found [17].\nLemma 1. Since \u2207f \u2032(\u03b1l) = 2ATl (Al\u03b1l \u2212 rl), the unique solution of (26) can be computed in closed form as\nProx\u00b5,\u2126\u2032 (G(\u03b1 n l )) = Prox\u00b5\u03b3,\u21132 \u25e6 Prox\u00b5\u03bb,\u21131(G(\u03b1nl )), (27) where f \u25e6 g(x) \u2206= f(g(x)) for any function f and g, [Prox\u00b5,\u21131(x)]i = sign(xi) \u00b7 (|xi| \u2212 \u00b5)+ (28)\nis the proximal operator of the \u21131-norm [17], and\nProx\u00b5,\u21132(x) =\n{ x\n\u2016x\u20162 (\u2016x\u20162 \u2212 \u00b5)+, if x 6= 0, 0, otherwise, (29)\nis the proximal operator of the \u21132-norm [17].\nProof: The proof follows a similar approach as in [18]\nbut for problem (22) and is omitted due to limited space.\nThe minimizer of group l is updated as\n\u03b1n+1l \u2190 Prox\u00b5,\u2126\u2032 (G(\u03b1\u0302 n l )) (30)\nwith the Nesterov step \u03b1\u0302nl = \u03b1 n l + n\u22121 n+2 (\u03b1nl \u2212 \u03b1n\u22121l ) which accelerates the convergence [17], and then is fixed while the other groups are minimized until next iteration. By iteratively updating {\u03b1l : l = 1, . . . , L}, the global solution for {P\u0304l : l = 1, . . . , L} in (25) can be reached. Then with the inverse transformation of (24) and some algebra, we achieve the complex S-LSFD vectors {ask : k = 1, . . . ,K}. B. Sparse AP-UE Association and Power Control\nAccording to the S-LSFD vectors {ask : k = 1, . . . ,K}, AP l does not serve UE k if askl = 0 since AP l will not contribute to the global estimate of sk in (6). Therefore, we have Mk = {l : askl 6= 0} for UE k. In the next section, we adopt the fractional power control [19]\npk = mini\u2208{1,...,K}\n(\u2211 l\u2208Mi \u03b2il )\u03b8\n(\u2211 l\u2208Mk \u03b2kl )\u03b8 pmax, (31)\nwhere pmax is the maximal uplink transmit power of a UE and \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 1] determines the power control behavior. During the optimization, (31) is used with Mk = {1, . . . , L}, \u2200k.\nIV. NUMERICAL RESULTS\nIn this section, we evaluate the performance of the proposed S-LSFD design in Section III and validate the algorithm convergence by comparing it to CVX [20]. We consider a setup with K = 20 UEs that are independently and uniformly dropped in a 0.5\u00d7 0.5 km2 area. The wrap-around technique is used to approximate an infinitely large network. We use the 3GPP Urban Microcell model to compute the large-scale propagation conditions, such as pathloss and shadow fading. The SE results with L-MMSE combining are obtained from Monte Carlo simulations while the results with MR combining are analytically computed by [9, Cor. 2]. Pilot assignment is performed with the scheme from [9]. The main system parameters are given in Table I and originate from [7], [16].\nWe consider two deployment setups: a) L = 40, N = 4 and b) L = 160, N = 1. Both setups have the total number of antennas LN = 160. To highlight the performance improvements of our joint AP-UE association and LSFD, we consider two benchmarks: the first one is the O-LSFD in (12) where all APs serve all UEs, and the second one applies the heuristic AP-UE association scheme from [9] followed by PLSFD. The latter is referred to as \u201cP-LSFD\u201d in this section.\nIn Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, we set the vertical scale intervals to emphasize how small/large the gaps are between the curves.\nIn Fig. 2, we first evaluate the average SE when the S-LSFD is used and we vary the regularization parameters \u03bb and \u03b3. The first observation is that both the average SE with L-MMSE combining and MR combining decreases as \u03bb increases since the number of serving APs per UE decreases. These SE results are only slightly below the O-LSFD but above the P-LSFD (for small values of \u03bb that let each UE be served by its most essential APs). The SE with MR combining drops more markedly than the SE with L-MMSE combining, since the interference suppression makes L-MMSE more robust to a reduction in the number of serving APs. This feature of L-MMSE also reflects on the SE gaps between the two AP deployment setups, where the L-MMSE case (between Fig. 2(a) and (b)) has more narrow gaps than the MR case (between Fig. 2(c) and (d)). Moreover, we notice that the multi-antenna AP setup outperforms the single-antenna AP setup in the L-MMSE case while it is the opposite in the MR case. The reason is that in the L-MMSE case, the interference suppression gain enabled by multiple antennas is more beneficial the macro diversity gain brought by having more APs. In contrast, the macro diversity gain dominates in the MR case, which relies on it for avoiding interference. When comparing the SE with different \u03b3, we notice the average SE loss compared to O-LSFD grows when \u03b3 increases for a similar reason as for \u03bb.\nFig. 3 shows the average EE of our S-LSFD design. It is clear that although our S-LSFD slightly reduces the SE, it significantly increases the EE compared to the O-LSFD where all APs serve all UEs. Our joint design also outperform PLSFD where the AP-UE association and LSFD are performed separately. We notice that the setup L = 40, N = 4 gives higher EE than the setup L = 160, N = 1 since it consumes\n10-4 10-3 10-2 10-1\n10-4 10-3 10-2 10-1\nmore power to have many APs (see (15)). Another observation is that the EE gaps between L-MMSE and MR is larger with multi-antenna APs (between Fig. 3(a) and (c)) than with single-antenna APs (between Fig. 3(b) and (d)) thanks to the interference suppression. The average EE is unimodal with respect to \u03bb in Fig. 3(b), (c), and (d), which implies that there exist a value of \u03bb that provides maximum average EE.\nThe convergence of our proposed proximal algorithm is validated by checking the following two metrics: the accuracy \u2206f/f\u2217 and the elapsed time. The accuracy is defined as the function value difference \u2206f = f \u2212 f\u2217 normalized by the \u201coptimal\u201d function value f\u2217 obtained by CVX, which is shown in Fig. 4. The elapsed times for convergence with different sparsity parameters are given in Table II, where the shadowed results correspond to CVX. Fig. 4 validates the correctness of our algorithm by showing the accuracy of 10\u22124. It can be seen in Fig. 4 that the proximal algorithm converges faster with a larger \u03bb. The results in Table II indicate the effectiveness of our algorithm where the elapsed time of our algorithm is much less than that of CVX, especially when \u03bb and \u03b3 are small."
