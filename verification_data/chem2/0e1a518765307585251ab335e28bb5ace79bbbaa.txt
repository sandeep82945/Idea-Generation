"Despite the abovementioned results, several factors restrict the production of TFs. Although the TFDG generation rate is high, the industrial application of free enzymes is impeded because they are either inactivated or cannot be recovered for reuse. Immobilized enzymes can effectively overcome the limitations of free enzymes."
