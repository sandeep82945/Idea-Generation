Email: shinji@yuhs.ac Abstract Among coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019) patients, physically active individuals may be at lower risk of fatal outcomes. However, to date, no meta\u2010analysis has been carried out to investigate the relationship between physical activity (PA) and fatal outcomes in patients with COVID\u201019. Therefore, this meta\u2010analysis aims to explore the hospitalisation, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and mortality rates of COVID\u201019 patients with a history of PA participation before the onset of the pandemic, and to evaluate the reliability of the evidence. A systematic search of MEDLINE/PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Scopus, and medRxiv was conducted for articles published up to January 2022. A random\u2010effects meta\u2010analysis was performed to compare disease severity and mortality rates of COVID\u201019 patients in physically active and inactive cases. Twelve studies involving 1,256,609 patients (991,268 physically active and 265,341 inactive cases) with COVID\u201019, were included in the pooled analysis. The overall meta\u2010 analysis compared with inactive controls showed significant associations between PA with reduction in COVID\u201019 hospitalisation (risk ratio (RR) = 0.58, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.46\u20130.73, P = 0.001), ICU admissions (RR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.52\u2013 0.81, P = 0.001) and mortality (RR = 0.47, 95% CI 0.38\u20130.59, P = 0.001). The protective effect of PA on COVID\u201019 hospitalisation and mortality could be attributable to the types of exercise such as resistance exercise (RR = 0.27, 95% CI 0.15\u20130.49, P = 0.001) and endurance exercise (RR = 0.41, 95% CI 0.23\u20130.74, P = 0.003), respectively. Physical activity is associated with decreased hospitalisation, ICU admissions, and mortality rates of patients with COVID\u201019. Moreover, COVID\u201019 patients with a history of resistance and endurance exercises experience a lower rate of hospitalisation and mortality, respectively. Further studies are warranted to determine the biological mechanisms underlying these findings.",

Email: shinji@yuhs.ac\nAmong coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019) patients, physically active individuals may be at lower risk of fatal outcomes. However, to date, no meta\u2010analysis has been carried out to investigate the relationship between physical activity (PA) and fatal\noutcomes in patients with COVID\u201019. Therefore, this meta\u2010analysis aims to explore the hospitalisation, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and mortality rates of\nCOVID\u201019 patients with a history of PA participation before the onset of the pandemic, and to evaluate the reliability of the evidence. A systematic search of\nMEDLINE/PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature,\nScopus, and medRxiv was conducted for articles published up to January 2022. A\nrandom\u2010effects meta\u2010analysis was performed to compare disease severity and mortality rates of COVID\u201019 patients in physically active and inactive cases. Twelve studies involving 1,256,609 patients (991,268 physically active and 265,341 inac-\ntive cases) with COVID\u201019, were included in the pooled analysis. The overall meta\u2010 analysis compared with inactive controls showed significant associations between\nPA with reduction in COVID\u201019 hospitalisation (risk ratio (RR) = 0.58, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.46\u20130.73, P = 0.001), ICU admissions (RR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.52\u2013\n0.81, P = 0.001) and mortality (RR = 0.47, 95% CI 0.38\u20130.59, P = 0.001). The\nprotective effect of PA on COVID\u201019 hospitalisation and mortality could be attributable to the types of exercise such as resistance exercise (RR = 0.27, 95% CI\n0.15\u20130.49, P = 0.001) and endurance exercise (RR = 0.41, 95% CI 0.23\u20130.74,\nP = 0.003), respectively. Physical activity is associated with decreased hospital-\nisation, ICU admissions, and mortality rates of patients with COVID\u201019. Moreover, COVID\u201019 patients with a history of resistance and endurance exercises experience a lower rate of hospitalisation and mortality, respectively. Further studies are\nwarranted to determine the biological mechanisms underlying these findings.\nAbbreviations: CI, confidence interval; COVID\u201019, coronavirus disease 2019; ICU, Intensive care unit; MET, Metabolic Equivalent of Task; PA, Physical activity; PRISMA, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta\u2010Analyses; RR, risk ratio; SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.\nRev Med Virol. 2022;32:e2349. wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/rmv \u00a9 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd. - 1 of 16https://doi.org/10.1002/rmv.2349\nK E YWORD S COVID\u201019, exercise, meta\u2010analysis, physical activity"

            "text": "The rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus two (SARS\u2010CoV\u2010 2) has led to 282 million confirmed cases and 5.4 million deaths.1 A high rate of transmission of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and mortality owing to COVID\u201019 is mainly due to emerging new variants, which make efforts less effective in the fight against the virus.2 However, a\nvariety of public health interventions such as government policy, mask\u2010wearing, and vaccination have been implemented worldwide to mitigate and control the spread of the outbreak of COVID\u201019 disease.3 Restrictive measures to prevent the spread have resul-\nted in difficulties for the population to maintain healthy lifestyles\nsuch as the engagement in recommended levels of physical activity (PA).4 Meyer et al.5 reported 30% reduction in PA during COVID\u2010 19 quarantine independent of sex and age. Specific home\u2010based PA recommendations have been recently published in an attempt to take advantage of both quarantine and staying physically active.6,7 Adherence to government PA guidelines during the COVID\u201019 pandemic has been strongly recommended. Studies have shown\nthat potential outcomes from leading an unhealthy lifestyle, such\nas hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) increase the risk of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection as well as the severity and mortality rate.8 Importantly, obesity and hypertension\nwere the most prevalent disorders reported in hospitalised and deceased patients due to COVID\u201019.9\u201011\nSeveral studies have shown that a baseline sedentary lifestyle increases the mortality of hospitalised patients with COVID\u201019.12\u201019\nMoreover, engaging in healthy lifestyle behaviours may protect against the most severe consequences of COVID\u201019 disease including systemic inflammation, and reduced quality of life.12,20,21\nImportantly, an unhealthy lifestyle has been considered a risk factor for COVID\u201019 hospital admission.15 Different mechanisms may explain the protective effect of PA on COVID\u201019 outcomes and disease severity.14 Regular PA improves immune function, and\nregularly active individuals have a lower incidence, intensity of symptoms, and mortality from COVID\u201019 and other various viral infections.22\u201025 Moreover, regular PA reduces the risk of systemic\ninflammation, which is considered the primary contributor to lung damage in COVID\u201019 patients.26 Additionally, it has a protective impact on COVID\u201019 risk factors such as obesity and hypertension.9,14 Furthermore, we previously reported that a sedentary lifestyles increase the risk of COVID\u201019 severity and mortality.16\nFurther, high hospitalisation rates have been reported in patients with less cardiorespiratory fitness.27\nGiven this mortality risk in physically inactive COVID\u201019 patients, this meta\u2010analysis aims to explore the hospitalisation,\nintensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and mortality rates of COVID\u2010 19 patients with a history of PA participation before the onset of\nthe pandemic."

            "text": "In this study, we performed pooled analyses to estimate the hospitalisation, ICU admissions, and mortality rates of COVID\u201019 patients based on prior PA engagement. This study is the first meta\u2010analysis to comprehensively compare disease severity in COVID\u201019 patients according to previous PA levels. The present meta\u2010analysis indicates that PA decreases the risk of hospitalisation, ICU admissions, and mortality rates of patients with COVID\u201019. Moreover, patients with low PA intensity had comparable outcomes with those who had\nmoderate to vigorous activities, suggesting any amount of PA may be\nbeneficial. Furthermore, subgroup analysis showed that the protective effect of PA on COVID\u201019 hospitalisation and mortality is strongest for resistance exercise and endurance exercise,\nrespectively.\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that PA reduces the incidence of non\u2010communicable and chronic diseases and the mortality in infectious diseases.39,40 The beneficial effects of regular PA on the\nimmune system have been considered one of the main underlying\nmechanisms in reducing severe outcomes in both chronic and infectious diseases and their subsequent hospitalisation.41\u201043 Additionally,\nregular PA has been shown to boost innate immune system re-\nsponses, including the production of macrophages, natural killer cells, and neutrophils.25,44 More importantly, there is an improvement in\nacquired immune system function including T cells and antibody responses following regular PA.45,46 In addition to the direct effects of\nPA on the immune system, the metabolic regulation as a result of\nparticipating in regular PA can also improve the innate immune system's response to pathogens.47 Taken together, these mechanisms partly explain the relationship between PA and COVID\u201019 severe outcomes in the present meta\u2010analysis.\nF I G U R E 3 (Continued)\nIn addition to the beneficial effects on the immune system, PA also brings cardiorespiratory and musculoskeletal adaptations.48\nAccording to the present results, increased muscle strength was\nassociated with a reduced risk of COVID\u201019 hospitalisation. Considering the effects of age on increasing hospitalisation49 and the observed anti\u2010sarcopenia effects of PA,50 participating in regular PA\nF I GUR E 4 Forest plot of the relationship between physical activity (PA) and the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019) mortality based on (a) study type, (b) PA\u2010induced adaptations and PA levels in cohort (c) and (d) cross\u2010sectional studies\ncan promote muscle strength while maintaining muscle mass, which effectively prevents the occurrence of severe cases of disease.50,51\nInteraction between exercised skeletal muscle and the immune system may be owing to the production of anti\u2010inflammatory cytokines such as IL\u20106.52 Moreover, in some progressive diseases such as some types of cancer, the maintenance of muscle mass has been associated\nwith more effective immune responses to fight against the severe outcomes of the disease.53,54 Taken together, the present findings\nand discussed mechanisms indicate that improved muscle strength may be protective from hospitalisation in COVID\u201019 disease. However, more studies are needed to investigate this issue.\nIn the present meta\u2010analysis, PA was associated with reducing the risk of ICU admission and mortality in COVID\u201019 patients. Moreover, the risk of mortality was associated with a lower baseline\nphysical fitness. It has been suggested that preexisting health conditions are a major cause of mortality in COVID\u201019.55 Christensen et al. (2021) have also suggested that although cardiorespiratory fitness may not predict COVID\u201019 infection, it was a predictor of disease progression and mortality.56 The current study results also\nsupport the relationship between the rate of mortality and aerobic fitness. Also, based on the present meta\u2010analysis results, combined exercises may reduce ICU admission rate, which may effectively\nF I G U R E 4 (Continued)\nreduce mortality risk. It seems that cardiorespiratory and muscular\nadaptations following regular combined exercise training can effectively prevent severe cases and mortality from COVID\u201019 disease.\nBased on the present meta\u2010analysis results, there is no significant difference between low and high levels of PA in ICU admission and mortality rates in COVID\u201019 patients. Although some studies suggested a link between higher levels of PA and a reduction in COVID\u2010 19 mortality, according to the European CVD Prevention Guidelines, 500\u2010100 MET per week is enough to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases.57 Moreover, according to the J\u2010shaped theory of the immune system, long\u2010term high\u2010intensity exercise training can also effectively suppress immune system responses and develop upper respiratory infections.58 Taken together, even moderate to low levels of PA can reduce the risk of severe COVID\u201019 and mortality. Although, more studies in this field can be helpful.\nAn important issue raised just after the outbreak of COVID\u201019 is the decline in PA levels. A population\u2010based study has shown that PA decreased by up to about 27.3% just 30 days after the onset of the COVID\u201019 pandemic.59 The potential risks of decreased PA in\ncommunities and new variants of the virus (e.g. delta and omicron) requires attention, as the present meta\u2010analysis results indicate that PA is associated with the risk of COVID\u201019 severe outcomes. General recommendations should continue to seek to improve the level\nof PA to counteract with possible new strains.\nFindings from the present meta\u2010analysis must be interpreted in light of its limitations. First, because most of the studies included in\nour analysis did not report comorbidities associated with severe COVID\u201019 outcomes, the association of PA with adverse COVID\u201019 outcomes may be more exaggerated than indicated by the estimates. More prospective and well\u2010organised studies are warranted to determine the leading cause of hospitalisation and mortality in COVID\u201019 patients and evaluate the impact of different aetiologies and clinical factors on prognosis. Second, most of the included studies\nused the International PA Questionnaire to measure PA behaviour\nand have not provided enough information about the types of PA and the possibility to reduce COVID\u201019 outcomes. Third, overall pooled analyses indicated a relationship between PA and COVID\u201019 severe outcomes. However, our results did not reach statistically significant\nlevels in some analyses likely owing to the paucity of included studies\nFunnel plot\nrorre dradnatS\nHospitalization rate Hospitalization rate based on type of exercise\nICU admissions rate\nICU admissions rate based on PA levels\nICU admissions rate based on type of exercise\nMortality rate\nMortality rate based on type of exercise\nMortality rate based on PA levels in cohort studies\nMortality rate based on PA levels in cross-sectional studies\nF I GUR E 5 Funnel plots for publication bias on fatal outcomes of COVID\u201019\nin relation to PA type and COVID\u201019 severe outcomes.

Finally, definitions used for the intensity of PA varied between studies and should be consistent in\nfuture studies."
