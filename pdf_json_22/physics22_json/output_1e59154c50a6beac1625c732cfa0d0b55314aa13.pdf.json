There are two configurations such as a black string (BS) phase when a mass parameter is zero and a black hole (BH) phase when a mass parameter is non-zero. We investigate their stability via the configuration entropy (CE). It is found that the BS is not always stable but the BH has a thermally stable range below the critical mass of the BH, which is consistent with thermodynamic instability.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe p-brane solutions have been suggested in [1, 2] by adding a number of p-extra dimensions to solutions for Einstein vacuum equations in higher dimensional spacetime and the simplest case of them is BS solutions by adding just one extra dimension in such a spacetime. It has been shown that BS and p-brane in asymptotically flat higher dimensional spacetime are unstable under gravitational perturbations [1, 2] (see [3] for reviews of the subject). In particular, it has been shown that the BTZ BS with the negative cosmological constant in fourdimensional spacetime is unstable in a certain range of the Kaluza-Klein (KK) mass under fermionic perturbation and gravitational perturbation [4] and a warped BS with nontrivial topologies in five-dimensional AdS spacetime is also unstable in some range of KK mass under the linear gravitational perturbation [5]. Accelerating BH is described by the so-called Cmetric [6\u20138], which can be written in the solution to Einstein\u2019s equation with negative cosmological constant describing accelerating BH [7]. It has been found that the special case of the C-metric [9] is a solution describing the BH on the Planck brane in the Randall-Sundrum (RS) brane world model I [10], whose generalized version for the case of the AdS C-metric has been studied in [11]. They have shown that there are two configurations such as the BS phase and the BH phase according to having or not having the mass parameter and the BH has a thermally stable range below the critical mass of the BH. The CE has suggested that the informational content in physical systems with localized energy density configurations through measure of their ordering in field configuration space [12, 13]. It has been extensively investigated for AdS/QCD holographic models [14\u201324] and performed for a detailed analysis of the thermal stability of a variety of physical systems [13\u201315, 20\u201336]. Thus, it is intriguing\n\u2217 kundol.koh@jejunu.ac.kr \u2020 cohlee@gmail.com\nthat the issue of the stability is generalized to the accelerating BH with the negative cosmological constant in four-dimensional spacetime.\nOn the other hand, the Gubser-Mitra conjecture [37, 38] has proposed that the dynamical instability coincides with thermodynamic instability. In the last years attempt to test this conjecture for a BTZ BS in fourdimensional spacetime was carried out in [4] and was generalized to higher dimensional spacetime [5]. It is possible to investigate the stability of the BTZ BS solution via the CE. Therefore, it is also intriguing that such a conjecture is established in this case.\nThe paper is organized as follows: In section II, we briefly review the accelerating BH with the negative cosmological constant in four-dimensional spacetime. In section III, we introduce the CE and explore thermodynamic instability for the BS and the BH. Finally, we summarize our results and give our discussion in section IV."

            "text": "BH\nThe metric with accelerating BH in AdS4 [7] is given as\nds24 = 1 A2(x \u2212 y)2 [ P (y)dt2 \u2212 dy 2 P (y) + dx2 Q(x) +Q(x)d\u03d52 ]\n(2.1)\nwith\nP (y) = \u2212\u03bb+ ky2 \u2212 2mAy3, (2.2) Q(x) = 1 + kx2 \u2212 2mAx3, (2.3)\nand the discrete parameter k=+1, 0, \u22121. The metric (2.1) satisfies the Einstein equation\nR\u00b5\u03bd = \u2212 3\nl24 g\u00b5\u03bd , (2.4)\n2 where l4 = 1/(A \u221a \u03bb+ 1) is a four-dimensional (bulk) cosmological parameter with an acceleration parameter A 1 and parameter \u03bb. Here, the parameter m has the relation with the mass of the BH and the constant x/y slices have the branes [9, 11]. The metric (2.1) has possible two configurations such as the BS and the BH. (i) when m = 0, adapting appropriate coordinate transformation, the BTZ BS in AdS4 is written as [11]\nds24 = l 2 4dz 2 + a2(z)l24\n[\n\u2212(\u03bbr2 \u2212 k)dt2 + dr 2\n\u03bbr2 \u2212 k + r 2d\u03d52\n]\n(2.5)\nwith a(z) = \u221a \u03bb cosh(z). Since the metric (2.5) on the constant z slices under \u03bb > 0 has locally the geometry of AdS3, it for k = +1 is reduced to the geometry of a BTZ BH [39] on surfaces of constant z\nds23 = \u2212(\u03bbr2 \u2212 1)dt2 + dr2\n\u03bbr2 \u2212 1 + r 2d\u03d52, (2.6)\nwhich satisfies RAB = \u22122\u03bbgAB. Here, the capital Latin indices A and B refer to the brane coordinates 0, 1, 2, and the Greek indices \u00b5 and \u03bd to the bulk coordinates 0, . . ., 3. (ii) when m > 0, the metric function Q(x) has exactly one positive root x = \u03b1, and is set with \u2206\u03d5 = 4\u03c0/|Q\u2032(x = \u03b1)| to avoid a conical singularity at x = \u03b1. The BH localized on a brane is given as [11]\nds23 = 1\nA2\n[ \u2212 ( \u03bbr2 \u2212 k \u2212 2mA r ) dt2\n+ dr2\n\u03bbr2 \u2212 k \u2212 2mAr + r2d\u03d52\n]\n, (2.7)\nwhich is similar to the above AdS metric (2.6), but has the extra term 2mA/r which is caused by the fourdimensional nature of the BH. In particular, in the case of k = +1 when 2mA is very much smaller than 1/ \u221a \u03bb, the extra term is negligible outside the horizon, and the exterior geometry is exactly matched with that of the BTZ BH. However, when 2mA is very much bigger than 1/ \u221a \u03bb, there will be significant deviations from the BTZ metric due to outside the BH [11]. Furthermore, it has been shown that after introducing RS brane world model I [10], four-dimensional newton\u2019s constant G4 has the relation with three-dimensional newton\u2019s constant G3 as follows:\nG3 = AG4 2 . (2.8)\n1 Even if the parameter A in the metric (2.1) could be absorbed in a redefinition of the coordinates, the four-dimensional cosmological parameter l4 = 1/(A \u221a \u03bb+ 1) sets the scale for the\nfour-dimensional constant \u039b4 = \u22123/l24 for \u03bb > \u22121 and one can recover called the AdS C-metric which describes black holes accelerating in AdS4. The parameter A is related to acceleration of the black hole and it has been introduced for convenience.\nEmploying a single auxiliary variable z, the parameter 2mA may be defined as\n2mA = (\u03bb+ z2)z\n\u221a 1 + z\n(\u03bb\u2212 z3)3/2 . (2.9)\nAs mentioned before, the metric (2.5) on the constant z under \u03bb > 0 for k = +1 reduces to the metric (2.6). Since we will focus on the metric (2.6), it is convenient to set \u03bb = 2 from now on.\nAs you see in Fig. 1, the parameter mA increases monotonically as the parameter z grows up. When mA goes to zero, z \u223c 2mA \u221a \u03bb \u223c 0 while when mA becomes\ninfinite, z \u223c \u03bb1/3 (z \u223c 3 \u221a 2 = 1.25992 for \u03bb = 2).\nUsing the first law of BH thermodynamics, the threedimensional mass of the BTZ BH on the brane M3 can be expressed in terms of the variable z\nM3 = 1\n2G3\nz2(1 + z)(\u03bb\u2212 z3) (\u03bb+ 3z2 + 2z3)2 , (2.10)\nand the four-dimensional mass of the BTZ BS M4 yields also\nM4 = 1\nG4A\nz2(1 + z)(\u03bb\u2212 z3) (\u03bb + 3z2 + 2z3)2 , (2.11)\nwhich is exactly matched with the three-dimensional mass M3 (2.10) by taking Eq. (2.8) [9, 11].\n3 As shown in Fig. 2, for A = 1, \u03bb = 2, and G4 = 1 the maximum mass (the purple point in Fig. 2) at z = 1 4 ( 3 \u221a 15 + 4 \u221a 14 + 3 \u221a 15\u2212 4 \u221a 14\u2212 1) is given as\nM4,max = 1\n12 . (2.12)\nThen, it has been found that the four-dimensional entropy of the BS is able to be given as the threedimensional entropy of the BTZ BH on the brane\nSBS = \u03c0\nA\n\u221a\n2M3 \u03bbG3 , (2.13)\nand the four-dimensional entropy of the BH in the bulk is\nS4,BH = 2\u03c0 G4A2 z \u03bb+ 3z2 + 2z3 . (2.14)\nFor A = 1, \u03bb = 2, and G4 = 1 the maximum entropy (the purple point in Fig. 3) at z = 14 ( 3 \u221a 15 + 4 \u221a 14 + 3 \u221a\n15\u2212 4 \u221a 14\u2212 1) is given as\nS4,max =\n16\u03c0\n(\n3 \u221a\n15 + 4 \u221a 14 + 3 \u221a 15 \u2212 4 \u221a 14 \u2212 1\n)\n64 +\n(\n3 \u221a\n15 + 4 \u221a 14 + 3 \u221a 15 \u2212 4 \u221a 14 \u2212 1 )2 ( 3 \u221a 15 + 4 \u221a 14 + 3 \u221a 15 \u2212 4 \u221a 14 + 5 )\n= 1.07354. (2.15)\nAs mentioned earlier, z approaches to \u03bb as the parameter mA goes to infinity (M4 \u2192 0). The four-dimensional entropy of the BH SBS (2.14) has the finite limit at z = \u03bb1/3\nS0 = 2\u03c0 3G4A2 1 \u03bb1/3(\u03bb1/3 + 1) , (2.16)\nwhich for A = 1, \u03bb = 2, and G4 = 1 becomes\nS0 = 2 3 \u221a 2\u03c0\n3 \u221a 4 ( 3 + 2 3 \u221a 2 ) + 2 = 0.735567, (2.17)\n(the orange point in Fig. 3) at z = 21/3. Thus, the BH entropy S4,BH (2.14) (the blue dotted curve in Fig. 4) grows up from 0 at mA = 0 (z = 0 and M4 = 0) to\nthe maximum value S4,max (2.15) at mA = 2/ \u221a 27 (z = 1 4 ( 3 \u221a 15 + 4 \u221a 14+ 3 \u221a 15\u2212 4 \u221a 14\u2212 1) and M4 = M4,max =\n1 12 ), and then it (the green solid curve in Fig. 4) decreases to the finite limit S0 (2.17) at mA = \u221e (z = \u03bb1/3 and M = 0)\nUpon substituting the three-dimensional mass of the BTZ BH M3 (2.10) and the relation of G3 and G4 (2.8) into the BTZ BS (2.13), one can get\nz(z3 + z2 \u2212 \u03bb) = 0, (2.18)\nthrough the matching between the entropy of the BS (2.13) and that of the BH (2.14). When z = 0, the mass and entropy of the BH with small mA (the blue dotted curve in Fig. 4) are equal to zero, which matches that of the BS (the green solid curve in Fig4.) as you see in Fig 4. One considers the matching between the mass and\nFIG. 3: From Eq. (2.14), plot of the four-dimensional entropy of the BH in the bulk S4,BH as the function of z for A = 1, \u03bb = 2 and G4 = 1.\nentropy of the BS (the green solid curve in Fig4.) and that of the BH with large mA (the red dotted curve in Fig4.), it satisfies\nz3 + z2 = \u03bb. (2.19)\nThe root of Eq. (2.19) for \u03bb = 2 is z = 1 which denote the crossover (black) point in Fig. 4. Then, the critical entropy S and the critical mass M are given as\nSc = 2\u03c0\n7 = 0.897598, (2.20)\nMc = 2\n49 = 0.0408163. (2.21)\nAs shown in Fig. 4, two branches (the red dotted curve and the blue dotted curve) are joined at the maximum mass M4,max (the purple point in Fig. 4). It has been investigated to be the instability of two localized BH solutions and the BS by employing entropy [11]. When 0 \u2264 M \u2264 M4,max (0 \u2264 mA \u2264 2/ \u221a 27), the BS entropy (the green solid curve in Fig. 4) and the BH entropy (the blue dotted curve in Fig. 4) increase as the mass grows up. Furthermore, the BS entropy (the green solid curve in Fig. 4) is bigger than the BH entropy (the blue dotted curve in Fig. 4). It means that the BS is thermally stable in such region. When 2/ \u221a 27 (M = M4,max) \u2264 mA \u2264 \u221e (M = 0), the BH entropy decreases to finite value S0 (2.17) as the parameter mA grows up. In particular, the BH entropy (the red dotted curve in Fig. 4) is bigger than the BS entropy (the green solid curve in Fig. 4) below the critical value mA = 3 \u221a 2) (M = Mc (2.21)), and it becomes stable."

(2.8). From the metric (2.6), the energy density of the BS \u03c1BS is given as\n\u03c1BS \u2261 T00 = A3\u03bb ( 4G4M3 \u2212A\u03bbr2 ) , (3.1)\nand from the metric (2.7), the energy density of the BH \u03c1BH is\n\u03c1BH \u2261 T00 = 2m2A2\nr4 +\nmA ( \u03bbr2 + 1 )\nr3 + \u03bb\u2212 \u03bb2r2.\n(3.2)\nThere is the system with spatially localized energy in position space x and the Fourier transform of the energy density \u03c1(x) as the function of the position x at frequency k is given as the complex number\n\u03c1(k) = 1\u221a 2\u03c0\n(\n\u03b1(k) + i\u03b2(k)\n)\n, (3.3)\nwith\n\u03b1(k) =\n\u222b xh\n0\n\u03c1(x) cos(kx)dx, (3.4)\n\u03b2(k) =\n\u222b xh\n0\n\u03c1(x) sin(kx)dx, (3.5)\nwhere there is an event horizon at x = xh. Then, the modal fraction of \u03c1(k) is defined as [31]\nF(k) = |\u03c1(k)| 2\n|\u03c1(k)|2max , (3.6)\nwith |\u03c1(k)|2 = \u03b12(k)+\u03b22(k) where |\u03c1(k)|2max denotes the maximum value of |\u03c1(k)|2. One may define the CE [13] as\nS[F ] = \u2212 \u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nF(k) log[F(k)]dk. (3.7)\nFrom now on, considering the CE difference of the BS and the BH, we will investigate the instability of the BS/BH system. The energy density of the BS (3.1) is independent of the parametermA while that of the BH (3.2) is depended on it. However, in the case of the upper branch (the red dotted curve in Fig. 4), the entropy of the BS matches that of the BH at the crossover (black) point in Fig. 4, and in the case of the lower branch (the blue dotted curve in Fig. 4), the entropy of the BS matches that of the BH at M = 0 in Fig. 4. Thus, the CE of the BS should match two branches of the BH at such points. After adapting these matching conditions and the CE (3.7), from the energy densities (3.1) and (3.2), the CE of the BS and that of the BH are numerically obtained as shown in Table I. The CE of the BH with large/small mA is written as SC,BH,L and SC,BH,S, and that of the BS with matching condition at the upper/lower branch of the BH is SC,BS,up and SC,BS,low. The CE dfference of SC,BH,L and SC,BH,S, that of SC,BH,L and SC,BS,up, and that of SC,BH,S and SC,BS,low are respectively defined as \u2206SC \u2261 SC,BH,S \u2212 SC,BH,L, \u2206S\u0304C \u2261 SC,BS,up \u2212 SC,BH,L, and \u2206S\u0303C \u2261 SC,BS,low \u2212 SC,BH,S as shown in Table I and plot them as you see in Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7. As shown in Fig. 5. (a), the CE of the BH with large/small mA monotonically decreases as the mass M grows up. In particular, since the CE difference of SC,BH,L and SC,BH,S, \u2206SC , is always positive as shown in Table I and in Fig. 5. (b), the CE of the BH with large mA SC,BH,L is stable, which correctly coincides with the result of thermodynamic analysis in section II that the BH with large mA is thermally stable through the comparison of the entropy of the BH with large mA and that\nM = 1/12 ( mA = 2/ \u221a 27). (b) From the Table 1, plot of the CE difference of the BH with small mA and the BH with large mA as a\nfunction of the mass M from M = 10\u22126 to M = 1/12, which always has positive values except for M = 1/12 (\u2206SC = 0). Here, the black point denotes the critical mass Mc.\nof the BH with small mA for given mass M as you see the red dotted curve and the blue dotted curve in Fig. 4.\nConsidering the CE difference of SC,BH,L and SC,BS,up,\n\u2206S\u0304, as the mass M decreases (the parameter mA increases), the BH has a smaller CE below the critical mass Mc defined in (2.21) (at which \u2206S\u0304C = 0) as you see in Table I and Fig. 6. The BH becomes thermally stable in this region, which is consistent with that in [11]\nAs shown in Table I and Fig. 7, for the BH with small mA,the CE difference of SC,BS,low \u2212 SC,BH,S, \u2206S\u0303 is always negative except for M = 10\u22126 (at which \u2206S\u0303 = 0), and the BS is thermally stable, which is well matched with that in [11]. On the other hand, it has been explored dynamical instability against gravitational/tensor perturbation for the BS [4, 5]. It has been found that the BS is stable beyond the critical value against perturbation, while it is unstable below the critical value. These instability behaviors which qualitatively agrees with thermodynamic instability behaviors in [11] also supports the Gubser-Mitra conjecture of that the dynamical instability coincides with thermodynamic instability.\n6"

We explored the thermal instability of these two configurations via CE. The CE of the BS and that of the BH were numerically obtained as shown in Table I. As the mass M increases, the CE of the BH with large/small mA monotonically decreases as well as that of the BS decreases as shown in Fig. 5. (a), Fig. 6. (a), and Fig. 7. It was found that the BS is thermally unstable (the BH is stable) below the critical mass Mc (2.21) when the BH has large mA while the BS is always stable when the BH has small mA, which is well matched with that in [11].\nRecently it has been proposed that for accelerating black holes in AdS spacetime they have calculated the dual stress-energy tensor for the spacetime and identify the energy density associated with a static observer at infinity. It has been shown that the dual energy-momentum tensor is able to be given by a non-hydrodynamic contri-\nbution with a universal coefficient to a three-dimensional perfect fluid and the result of the holographic computation is well matched with that of conformal completion method for the mass [40]. It is intriguing to investigate whether the thermal instability from both sides yields the same result through employing the CE.\nData Availability Statements: the data sets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request."
