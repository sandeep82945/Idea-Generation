1. **Investigate the use of other machine learning algorithms for predicting antibreast cancer drug properties.** The paper uses the MobileNetV3 deep convolutional network for this task, but other algorithms such as support vector machines or random forests could also be explored.
2. **Develop a more comprehensive dataset of antibreast cancer drug candidates.** The dataset used in the paper is relatively small, so it would be beneficial to collect more data to improve the accuracy of the prediction models.
3. **Explore the use of machine learning for other aspects of drug design.** For example, machine learning could be used to design new drug molecules or to predict the efficacy of drug combinations.
4. **Investigate the use of machine learning to personalize drug treatment for breast cancer patients.** This could involve using machine learning to predict the best drug for a particular patient based on their individual characteristics.
5. **Develop a user-friendly software tool that incorporates the machine learning models developed in this paper.** This would make it easier for researchers and clinicians to use the models to predict antibreast cancer drug properties and design new drugs.
