            "text": "The Feynman propagator, \u0394 ( , ), for charged, scalar particles of mass m is defined by\n\u0394 ( , ) = 0 { ( ) ( )} 0\n(1)\nwhere T is the time ordering operator, |0 \u27e9 is the vacuum state and ( ) is the field operator,\n( ) = \u222b\n( )\n+ k , (2)\nor in manifestly covariant form\n( ) = 1\n(2 )\n+ ( \u2212 ) ( ) k , (3)\nwhere \u03b8( ) is the unit step function and = = \u221a + in natural units [1]. In these expressions, the lowering and raising operators for particles and antiparticles satisfy the commutation relations\n, = ,\n= (2 ) 2 ( \u2212 \u2032) (4)\nwith other commutators of these operators vanishing. Interpreted as a Green's function, the Feynman propagator is the solution of the following modified Klein-Gordon equation with a point source [1]\n\u2212 \u2207 + \u2212 \u0394 ( , ) = \u2212\n( \u2212 ) (5)\nThe provenance of the small, imaginary term (eventually \u03b5\u21920) is related to the particular choice of boundary conditions that ensures Eq. (1) is the solution of Eq. (5); instead of shifting a contour in the integral solution of Eq. (5) to avoid poles on the x-axis, we instead shift the poles to either side by introducing -i\u03b5 and elect to maintain the contour on the axis. With the use of Wick's theorem, the Feynman propagator can be used to perturbatively compute many important quantities in quantum field theory, such as scattering cross-sections.\nOne key property of the Feynman propagator that is used implicitly in such calculations, but not often studied per se, relates to its sign, which we will examine in this paper. For this purpose, it is convenient to import some of the bra-ket and operator notation of quantum mechanics, but without some of the interpretations normally associated therewith. This is similar to how Barut uses this notation in a purely classical field theoretic setting ( [2], p. 150-151). Thus, the operator version of Eq. (5) is\n\u2212 \u0302 \u0302 +\n\u2212 \u0394 = \u2212 .\n(6)\nHere, the operator  \u0302satisfies \u27e8 | \u0302 | \u27e9 =\n, \u2207 where \u27e8 | \u27e9 = ( \u2212 ); the kets | \u27e9 are\nnot to be interpreted as eigenstates of the position operator. (See [3], section 3c.) Moreover, we should remind ourselves that in quantum field theory, states of the multi-particle system live in Fock space with the ladder and field operators being defined therein. The ket | \u27e9, on the other hand, is not a member of Fock space. Likewise, the operator  \u0302is not to be confused with the field momentum operator P.\nFrom Eq. (6), the operator Feynman propagator is \u0394 = \u0302 \u0302 \u2212\n+\n. For a\nmore general operator ( , )\u0302, the kernel ( , ) = \u27e8 | | \u27e9 of two space time variables x and y may be used to define a functional\n[ ]= \u27e8 | | \u27e9, (7) where\n\u27e8 | | \u27e9 = \u2217( ) ( , ) ( ) .\n(8)\nThe functional is positive semidefinite (\u201cpositive\u201d for short, when there is no ambiguity) if\n\u2217( ) ( , ) ( ) \u2265 0 (9)\nfor all integration regions and test functions f for which the integral exists, and we succinctly write \u2265 0 . More restrictively, may be positive for certain regions, such as a specific spacelike surface, or a class of test functions of physical relevance. A functional is indeterminate if it has no sign, meaning it is none of positive, positive semidefinite, negative and negative\nsemidefinite. If we let = ( + ) and =\n( \u2212 ), then = + , and\n\u27e8 | | \u27e9 and \u27e8 | | \u27e9 are real numbers,\nRe \u222c \u2217( ) ( , ) ( ) = \u222c \u2217( ) ( , ) ( ) , (10)\nand\nIm \u222c \u2217( ) ( , ) ( ) = \u222c \u2217( ) ( , ) ( ) . (11)\nWe can write this as Re = and Im = .\nIt turns out that Re \u0394F \u2265 0 . This is relevant, for example, when computing the generating functional for n-point functions, which is given by the vacuum-to-vacuum transition amplitude [1], [ , \u2217]:\n[ , \u2217]= exp \u2212 \u2217( ) \u0394 ( , ) ( )\n(12)\nwhere ( ) is a source. That Re \u0394F is of positive sign ensures that [ , \u2217] is well defined as a probability amplitude.\nEq. (1) is the Feynman propagator for a free scalar field. The Feynman propagator also arises in the context of interacting fields where it may be defined as\n\u0394 , ( , ) = Tr 0 { ( )\n( )} 0\n(13)\nwhere is the thermal equilibrium density operator of the electromagnetic field regarded as a heat reservoir (hence the subscript \"R\") that we trace out. (Cf. Eq. 8.94 of [1].) The field operator\nin Eq. (13), associated initially with the matter degrees of freedom, are in the Heisenberg picture, evolving under the total (hence the subscript \u201cT\u201d) Hamiltonian containing both KleinGordon and electromagnetic operators.\nFor example, use may be made of a thermal Feynman propagator in the study of open quantum electrodynamics [4]. Here, too, the positive sign property of the Feynman propagator is important when calculating relevant amplitudes. Another example where a thermal Feynman propagator is utilized is in the study of the electroweak interaction at high temperatures, in analogy with phase transitions in ferromagnetism [5].\nWhen studying interacting or open systems we may ask whether approximations often employed therein preserve the sign of the Feynman propagator. In this paper, we will show that reversibility---or invertibility of the underlying dynamical map---is central to preserving the aforementioned sign property under such cases. Approximations leading to irreversible dynamics generally destroy the positive sign of Re \u0394F ,int. We will focus on one such approximation, the weak coupling approximation [6], which can yield a completely positive dynamical map,\n\u039b (\u22c5) = \u2211 ( ) \u22c5 ( ) , (14)\ncharacterized by Kraus operators satisfying\n\u2211 ( ) ( ) = , (15)\nthe latter equation ensuring that normalization is preserved [7]. The Kraus operators, used for describing the temporal evolution of open systems, are analogous to the unitary evolution operator ( ) that appears in the Liouville propagator ( ) \u22c5 ( ), which is used to describe\nevolution in isolated systems. For reasons that we will elucidate in detail below, unlike the argument of ( ), which can be positive or negative, it is often necessary to restrict to nonnegative values when dealing with Kraus operators. When \u039b has a group theoretic structure, for instance, we mean the semigroup property (\u039b \u039b = \u039b for , \u2265 0 ) not the group\nproperty. Physically, this means that there is no map \u039b that can reverse the dynamics of \u039b . We will show that if we were to insist that \u039b(\u22c5) be invertible then there would exist one Kraus\noperator chosen from the set to which all the others would be merely proportional. This\nrestriction is physically untenable for an open system and yet abandoning reversibility jeopardizes the positive sign condition. Fortunately, we will also show that with a further oftused approximation, the rotating wave approximation [6], we may recover the sign even for reduced dynamics when we restrict ourselves to exponential test functions under certain conditions.\nThe Feynman propagator, suitably modified, plays a significant role in many quantum field theories. As a concrete example, we will focus on scalar electrodynamics in which the appropriate Schrodinger equation for the scalar field is the Klein-Gordon equation. While admittedly one motivation for concentrating on scalar fields is expediency---they are simpler to treat than fields describing nonzero spin particles---scalar field theories can be used in their own right as effective theories to treat composite particles, such as various mesons subject to nucleonnucleon interactions [8], and also as a means to treat the fundamental, scalar Higgs boson. In addition, every component of a spin 1/2 and spin 1 field--described by the Dirac equation, and the Maxwell and Proca equations, respectively--also obeys a Klein-Gordon equation [1]."

(22) are given by\n= ( , ) /\n, (23)\nthe {| \u27e9 } being a complete set of reservoir states.\nIt is well known that the unitary propagator corresponding to a conservative Hamiltonian possesses three useful properties,\n( , ) = ( , ) ( , ) composition (24) ( , ) = ( \u2212 , 0 ) time translation (25) ( , 0 ) ( , 0 ) = ( + , 0 ) group (26)\nwhere , , \u2208 \u211d . Assuming any two of the foregoing properties to be true and ( , ) = implies the third.\nUnfortunately, the reduced propagator \u0393 , appearing in Eq. (22) is not so richly endowed.\nAlthough it does inherit time translation invariance so that \u0393 , = \u0393 , for \u2265 if is conservative, \u0393 does not generally obey the composition rule. Neither does \u0393 generally yield a semigroup (\u0393 , \u0393 , = \u0393 , for , \u2265 0 ), even if forms a group.\nIn statistical physics, the composition property is known as the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation, which relies on the Markov approximation [9]. Similarly, for reduced dynamics, one assumption that can be made to recover the composition rule is that the total evolution remains in an uncorrelated state throughout, which is to say [6]\n( , ) \u2a02\n( , ) = \u0393 , \u2a02\n(27)\nwith \u2265 . Reduced dynamics given by Eq. (27) would enjoy properties (24)-(26). Because the usefulness of a total Hamiltonian that exactly yields Eq. (27) is doubtful, the assumption of uncorrelated behavior is demoted to an approximation and applied to particular, total systems where appropriate.\nIn fact, Eq. (27) is in some sense more than is needed in the computation of the interacting Feynman propagator and other multi-time correlation functions, which involve traces over various operators. It is enough, for relevant operators and , that [4], [6]\nTr ( , ) \u2a02 ( , ) \u2243 Tr \u0393 , \u2a02 (28)\nwith \u2265 , which may be referred to as the weak coupling approximation, an idealization where the reservoir is \"refreshed\" back to equilibrium when tracing over the reservoir variables in certain coarse-grained expressions. Although the behavior implied by expressions (27) and (28) is a fiction---for an initially uncorrelated total state and coupled degrees of freedom, we would expect to find only one privileged time ( ) at which the system of interest and reservoir are uncorrelated---nevertheless the weak coupling approximation may be reasonable on physical grounds for some operators and . (For example, when these last two operators are of the form \u2a02 and \u2a02 , with and being matter operators, expression (28) is exact.) Attractively, the weak coupling approximation yields\n\u0393 , ( ) = Tr ( , ) ( , ) \u2a02 ( , ) ( , ) (29)\n\u2243 Tr ( , )\u0393 , ( )\u2a02 ( , ) (30)\n= \u0393 , \u0393 , ( ) (31)\nwith \u2264 \u2264 , where use was made of the composition property (24) of the total propagator in\nline (29) and approximation (28) with = = ( , ) in line (30). Hence the weak coupling approximation plays a role in ensuring that the composition rule follows, much like the Markov approximation ensures that the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation is obeyed. Moreover, from the composition property and time translational invariance of the map \u0393, the semigroup property follows.\nMulti-time averages were computed in [6], [10] and [11]. We follow [6] in using the weak\ncoupling approximation to obtain multi-time averages below. The adjoint map \u0393 , defined by Tr \u0393 ( ) = Tr[ \u0393( )], together with the weak coupling approximation may be used to make\nthe following replacement:\nTr [ ( ) ( \u2212 )]\u2192 Tr[ ( ) ( \u2212 )] (32)\nwhere ( ) = ( ) ( ), ( ) = ( ) \u2297\n( ), ( ) = \u0393 ( ) and ( ) = \u0393 ( ),\nprovided \u2265 . Operators without subscripts continue to denote system of interest (matter) operators and here \u0393 is some dynamical map derived, usually approximately, from Eq. (22). Whereas the time argument in ( ) and ( ) can be positive or negative, the price we pay in moving to reduced dynamics is that the time argument in ( ) and ( ) in general must be nonnegative, with attendant consequences. We will make repeated use of expression (32) below when computing the interacting Feynman propagator.\nInteracting Feynman Propagator in Reduced Dynamics\nTo make use of the substitution (32), it is imperative that we only propagate forward in time. This stipulation at once allows us to obtain reduced dynamics and generally destroys the positive sign of the interacting Feynman propagator.\nLater, we will detail why reversibility is not allowed, but for now let us accept this premise and prepare for the application of the weak coupling approximation by expressing a twotime average as follows.\nTr [ ( ) \u2a02 ( )]\n= ( \u2212 )Tr [ ( \u2212 ) ( ) ] + ( \u2212 )Tr [ ( ) ( \u2212 )]\n(33)\nwhere we have assumed the underlying total Hamiltonian is conservative and , \u2265 0 . (If Eq. (33) is to apply when = , we must define (0 ) = 1 /2 .) Only one of the two terms on the right-hand side is non-zero. Because in that surviving term only non-negative time arguments appear, we may use substitution (32) in the last term and a similar substitution in the first term on the right-hand side of Eq. (33) to yield\nTr [ ( ) \u2a02 ( )]\u2192 ( \u2212 )Tr[ ( \u2212 ) ( ) ]\n+ ( \u2212 )Tr[ ( ) ( \u2212 )].\n(34)\nEven though ( \u2212 ) is not defined if < , we assume that in such case the step function dominates and take ( \u2212 )Tr[ ( \u2212 ) ( ) ] to be zero, and similarly for the last term if < . Using the substitution (34) in Eq. (21), we may approximate\n\u2217( ) \u0394 , ( , ) ( ) \u2245\nRe \u2217( ) ( ) ( \u2212 )Tr{[ (0 , ), ( \u2212 , )] ( )}\n+ Im \u2217( ) ( ) ( \u2212 )Tr{[ ( \u2212 , ), (0 , )] ( )}\n(35)\nAlthough the exact Re \u0394 , is a positive functional, after invoking the weak coupling\napproximation we see from the first term of the right-hand side of expression (35) that we have manifestly lost the sign property. If the dynamics were reversible, which we will see in the next section it generally is not, we could reconstitute the sign of Re \u0394 , from expression (35).\nTo wit, suppose \u0393 possessed the group property, were invertible and satisfied (cf. equation 2.3 of [12])\n\u0393 ( ) = \u0393 ( ) (36)\nand\n\u0393 ( ) = \u0393 ( )\u0393 ( ). (37) (In fact, Eqs. (36) and (37) follow from invertibility, as characterized in Appendix 2, and are therefore superfluous.) With these properties in hand, we would compute\nTr{[ ( ), ( \u2212 , )] ( )} = Tr \u0393 ( ), \u0393 \u0393\n( )\n(38)\n= 0 [ ( ), ( )] 0 . (39)\nThat we used invertibility is apparent from the presence of \u0393 in Eq. (38). Substituting Eq. (39)\ninto the first term on the right-hand side of expression (35), we would obtain\nRe \u2217( ) \u0394 , ( , ) ( )\n\u2245 Re \u2217( ) ( ) ( \u2212 ) 0 [ ( ), ( )] 0\n(40)\n= \u222c \u2217( ) ( ) 0 [ ( ), ( )] 0\n.\n(41)\nAs a reminder, we note that unlike in Eq. (17), the field operators in Eq. (41), for example, are evolving under reduced dynamics, ( ) = \u0393 [ ( )]. Again we see that Re \u0394 , \u2265 0 . Thus, pretending that reduced dynamics were invertible allows us to recover the positive sign."

            "text": "We have seen that the positive sign of Re \u0394 may hinge on the invertibility of the dynamical map, so it is important to understand where the notion of irreversibility of reduced dynamics comes from.\nIf \u212c (\u210b ) denotes the Banach space of trace class operators on the separable Hilbert\nspace \u210b with trace norm \u2016 \u2016 = Tr\u221a , then \u212c (\u210b ) \u2282 \u212c (\u210b ) is the set of physical density operators, which are positive, self-adjoint and normalized (\u2016 \u2016 = 1 , \u2208 \u212c (\u210b )) [12], [13], [14]. On physical grounds, it has been argued that physical density operators should be completely positive, not merely positive [15]. For our purposes, completely positive operators can be taken to mean operators that arise from evolution governed by Eq. (14). (A frequently cited example of an operator that is positive, but not completely positive, is the operator that returns the transpose of the density matrix [16].)\nA completely positive dynamical map \u039b depends on a time parameter and maps \u2208\n\u212c (\u210b ) to \u2211 ( )\n( ) \u2208 \u212c (\u210b ) where the are operators on \u210b that satisfy the\nnormalization condition, Eq. (15). Such maps are convex linear [4], [12] meaning that\n\u039b( + (1 \u2212 ) ) = \u039b( ) + (1 \u2212 )\u039b( ) (42) where , \u2208 \u212c and 0 \u2264 \u2264 1 .\nTo understand why we must insist on a preferred direction of time, consider the following example of a manifestly covariant, completely positive dynamical map (cf. equation 5.20 of [17]),\n,\u2219,\n= 1\n2 \u221a exp \u2212 4\n(43)\nwhere \u03c4 is a scalar playing the role of proper time, are real 4-vector parameters, \u0302 is the fourmomentum Hermitian operator and\n{ , , } \u2261 + \u2212 2 . (44) This dynamical map gives rise to the master equation\n= \u2212 \u0302, ( ),\n\u0302 , (45)\nwhich is in prototypical Lindblad form [15]. A candidate for an inverse is [18]\n,\u2219,\n= \u221a \u222b exp \u2212\n, (46)\nwhich, by direct computation, can be seen to satisfy\n,\u2219,\n,\u2219,\n= . (47)\nWhat then is the problem with claiming that ,\u2219,\nis the inverse of ,\u2219,\nand therefore that the latter exhibits reversible dynamics? A priori, there are three possible reasons that could preclude invertibility: ,\u2219, is a) not one-to-one on, but is onto \u212c , b) one-toone on, but not onto \u212c , or c) neither one-to-one on nor onto \u212c .\nSuppose\n0 = ,\u2219,\n\u2212 ,\u2219,\n(48)\n= \u27e8 |( \u2212 )| \u2032\u27e9\n| \u27e9\u27e8 \u02b9| \u2032 (49)\nIf the | \u27e9\u27e8 \u02b9| are linearly independent, we require \u27e8 | | \u2032\u27e9 = \u27e8 | | \u2032\u27e9, which implies = . I.e., ,\u2219, is one-to-one. Hence, the problem must be that \u039b \u2261 ,\u2219, is not onto \u212c . Let us confirm this.\nBecause ,\u2219,\n: \u212c \u2192 Ran \u039b \u2282 \u212c is one-to-one, the inverse\n,\u2219,\n: Ran \u039b \u2192 \u212c exists and is given by Eq. (46). We wish to show that Ran \u039b is a\nproper subset of \u212c . For every pure state | \u27e9\u27e8 | \u2208 \u212c , we have\n,\u2219,\n| \u27e9\u27e8 | = 1\n2 , ( ) +\n1 2 , ( ) (50)\nwhere ,\u00b1( ) \u2208 \u212c with\n,\u00b1( ) = \u221a \u222b exp \u2212\n\u2213\n| \u27e9\u27e8 | \u00b1\n. (51)\nIn the position representation,\n,\u00b1( ) \u2032 = \u221a \u222b exp \u2212\n( \u00b1 ) \u2217( \u2032 \u00b1 ) . (52)\nThe density operators , ( ) and , ( ) are statistical mixtures consisting of a Gaussianweighted sum of pure states | \u27e9\u27e8 | uniformly translated to the left and right, respectively,\nthe Gaussian having a standard deviation of \u221a 2 .\nExpressing | \u27e9 as a superposition of plane waves, | \u27e9 = \u222b\n( )| \u27e9 , and taking an\narbitrary physical state | \u27e9, we compute\n,\u2219,\n,\u00b1\n= |\u27e8 | \u27e9|\n\u00b1 Im erf\n\u2212 \u2032 \u221a Im ( ) \u2217( ) \u2217( \u2032) ( \u2032) \u2032\n(53)\nIf we choose to be orthogonal to and assume the real, last term on the right-hand side of Eq. (53) to be non-vanishing, then either ,\u2219,\n, or ,\u2219,\n, is\nnegative, which implies that either , or , is not in the domain of ,\u2219,\ndespite both\nbeing physical density operators. This means that there is no pair \u00b1 \u2208 \u212c such that\n,\u2219,\n\u00b1 = ,\u00b1, which is to say ,\u2219,\nis not onto \u212c . The map\n,\u2219,\nis not defined on the set of all physical states. A result along these lines was reported in [18].\nThere is another way to arrive at this conclusion using an argument presented in Theorem\n3.4.1 of [13]. Suppose a completely positive dynamical map \u039b: \u212c \u2192 \u212c takes a pure state to a mixture, | \u27e9\u27e8 | \u21a6 + (1 \u2212 ) , where 0 < < 1 and the physical states and are unequal. Then a convex linear inverse \u039b : Ran \u039b \u2192 \u212c cannot be defined at both and for otherwise = \u039b\u039b ( ) = \u039b(| \u27e9\u27e8 |) = + (1 \u2212 ) , = 1 ,2 , which is a contradiction. (The second equation follows because \u039b ( ) + (1 \u2212 )\u039b ( ) = | \u27e9\u27e8 | \u21d2 \u039b\n( ) = | \u27e9\u27e8 |.)\nIn our above example, Eq. (45) yields, for an initial pure state,\nTr\n| = \u2212 4\u0394\n\u0302 (54)\nwhere the initial uncertainty \u0394 \u0302 = \u2329 \u0302 \u232a \u2212 \u2329 \u0302\u232a . Since Tr < 1 only if is a\nstatistical mixture, for any pure state with \u0394 \u0302 \u2260 0 , a pure state maps to a mixture for short enough values of . Consequently, the domain of ,\u2219, cannot be all of \u212c for such values of . In some sense, this is not surprising since the map given by Eq. (46) is not manifestly positive; recalling that either , or , is not in the domain of ,\u2219, , this map yields a positive image for some, but not all physical states.\nFor a more general dynamical map \u039b, it is shown in Appendix 2 that invertibility imposes severe restrictions on the associated Kraus operators. Under reasonable hypotheses, if the map\ngiven by Eq. (14) is invertible, then there exists one Kraus operator chosen from the set to\nwhich all the others are merely proportional (cf. Theorem 3.4.1 in [13] and Theorem 6.39 in [19]). Except in this extreme case, we cannot assume that \u039b is invertible, and therefore cannot perform the steps at the end of the last section to demonstrate that Re \u0394 , \u2265 0 ."

This result is not just academic. Such exponential functions arise, for example, when using adiabatic switching methods to derive the Gell-mann-Low theorem and reduction formulae that follow therefrom [20]. Sufficient conditions for a positive sign with these exponential functions are given below by inequality (67).\nIn the field of quantum optics, the rotating wave approximation is used to obtain the wellknown quantum optical master equation [21]\n=\n1\n\u210f [\u210f , ]\u2212\n( )\n2 [ ( ){ , , } + ( ( ) + 1 ){ , , }].

            "text": "For the interacting Feynman propagator of scalar electrodynamics, we have shown that the\npositive sign condition, Re \u0394 , \u2265 0 , may hinge on the reversibility of time evolution. When we switch to reduced dynamics under the weak coupling approximation, this sign is lost for all but extreme cases. This loss arises because we cannot assume that reduced dynamics is reversible without imposing severe restrictions on the Kraus operators that govern time evolution. Fortunately, with another approximation, the rotating wave approximation, we can recover some semblance of a positive sign property by ensuring inequality (67) is true and restricting the test functions to exponentials given by Eq. (55). The field theoretic analog (57) of the quantum optical master equation (56) fulfils this inequality exactly. In contrast to Re \u0394 , , the functional Im \u0394 is indeterminate.\nAppendix 1\nWe would like to show that Im \u0394 , is an indeterminate functional, which we accomplish\nby looking at the special case Im \u0394 , = Im \u0394 , where \u0394 ( , ) is the free Feynman propagator.

The first singular term vanishes when is not on the light cone. The second term is also zero outside of the light cone, but inside, a non-zero contribution depending on a first order Bessel function arises due to the massive scalar particle. Such a Lorentz transformation can be avoided by relying on well-known integrals.\nThe integral with respect to k on the right-hand side of Eq. (71) may be computed by employing the usual trick of using a coordinate system whose polar axis coincides with x-y. Then, when we adopt spherical coordinates, the polar (inclination) angle and the angle between k and x-y are equal, which simplifies the calculation.\nIm \u0394 [ ]=\n1\n2 Re \u2217( ) ( ) ( \u2212 )\u2016 \u2212 \u2016 \u00d7\n\u2016 \u2016 \u222b\n( )\u221a\n\u221a cos(\u2016 \u2212 \u2016 )\n.\n(72)\nAccording to [23] (integral 3.876.1), with , \u2016 \u2212 \u2016, \u2212 > 0 ,\nsin ( \u2212 )\u221a +\n\u221a + cos(\u2016 \u2212 \u2016 )\n= ( \u2212 \u2212 \u2016 \u2212 \u2016) 2 ( \u2212 )\n(73)\nwhere is the zeroth order Bessel function and ( ) is 1 if > 0 and 0 if < 0 . One can also verify that Eq. (73) continues to hold when \u2212 = \u2016 \u2212 \u2016 provided (0 ) = 1 /2 . Inserting Eq. (73) into Eq. (72), and using ( ) = \u2212 ( ) [24] (9.1.28), and ( ) = ( ), we arrive at\nIm \u0394 [ ]= \u2212 Re \u2217( ) ( ) (\n\u2212 ) (( \u2212 ) )\n2\n\u2212 (( \u2212 ) )\n4\n( \u2212 )\n( \u2212 )\n(74)\n(cf.

The quantity in square brackets is, to within a sign, the well-known Jordan-Pauli function [25] (Eq. 2.3.18).\nThe appearance of the light-like contributing first term inside the square brackets of Eq. (74) arising from a massive scalar particle may be surprising, until we realize that it is exactly canceled with a contribution from the Bessel function term. To this end, we assume a product form of the test functions, \u00b1( ) = ,\u00b1( ) ( ). Next, we use the three-dimensional convolution theorem in the integration over x and y. Then, after introducing spherical coordinates, we once again utilize a coordinate system whose polar axis coincides with x to obtain:\nIm \u0394 [ ]= \u2212 2\n(2 ) Re ,\u00b1\n\u2217 ( ) ,\u00b1( ) ( \u2212 ) \u00d7\n| ( )|\n\u2016 \u2016 sin(\u2016 \u2016 )\n(( \u2212 ) \u2212 )\n2\n\u2212 (( \u2212 ) \u2212 )\n4\n( \u2212 ) \u2212\n( \u2212 ) \u2212\nwhere is the Fourier transform of , ( ) = \u222b \u2219 ( ) .

The peculiar choice of ,\u00b1( ) is motivated in part by the well-known result ( [26], p. 478) that the\nFourier transform of the right-hand side of Eq. (76) is proportional to the simple expression\n( \u00b1 ). According to [23] (integral 6.677.6), with > 0 ,\n\u222b ( \u2212 ) \u2212 cos(\u2016 \u2016 ) =\n( ) \u2016 \u2016\n\u2016 \u2016\n(77)\nInserting (77) into (75) and using the convolution theorem along with Eq.

Because the integrand is negative, Im \u0394 [ ]\u00d7 Im \u0394 [ ]< 0 . This shows that Im \u0394 is an indeterminate functional.\nAppendix 2\nIn this appendix we explore the constraints that Kraus operators must satisfy if the associated dynamical map is invertible. Reduced dynamics is often associated with irreversibility. Indeed, the term irreversible dynamics is sometimes used synonymously with reduced dynamics, which is typically associated with a governing master equation. Dynamical maps can be inverted---a previous approach to reduce noise in quantum computation relied on deconvolutions [27], which are inverses---but this comes at the cost of imposing various restrictions. If we insist that the domain of the inverse is the set of all physical states, \u212c (\u210b ), as opposed to a circumscribed subset, these restrictions may be too severe to be physically relevant. This means that a dynamical map derived from Eq. (22) and that is onto \u212c (\u210b ) cannot be inverted for all practical purposes that do not involve trivial or contrived cases.\nThe relevance to our work is that we have seen that the positive sign property of the Feynman propagator hinges on being able to invert the time evolution propagator under the weak coupling approximation. When the underlying dynamical map is not invertible, the sign can be lost. Thus, it is important to understand why reversibility breaks down.\nAlong these lines, the authors of [13] used, inter alia, contractivity together with Wigner's\ntheorem to prove that a \"UDM [universal dynamical map], \u2130( , ), can be inverted by another UDM if and only if it is unitary \u2130( , ) = ( , ).\" Similarly, it is proven in [19] (Theorem 6.39) that if a unital completely positive map is invertible, then it is a unitary conjugation.\nWe will see that this result, in which invertibility is used to prove unitarity, also arises as a corollary to the main theorem below, which is obtained using a different approach that relies on the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for vectors in the Hilbert space \u210b . A similar use of this inequality appears in [28].\nWe start with two lemmas, the first of which is proved in [13] and is included here for\ncompleteness. In this appendix, we suppress the time argument in \u039b and denote by \u210b a separable Hilbert space.\nLemma 1\nA convex linear, one-to-one map \u039b: \u212c (\u210b ) \u2192 \u212c (\u210b ) cannot map a statistical mixture to a pure state."

In terms of equivalence classes, for every there exists a such\nthat = . Thus, the representative vector has a preimage | \u27e9 = | \u27e9 where \u2208 .\nAny other \u2208 is the image of where = . Since these considerations apply to\nall classes, we have shown that all normalized vectors are in the range of . If is an unnormalized, nonzero vector, then its preimage is \u2016 \u2016 where | \u27e9 = | \u27e9/\u2016 \u2016. Finally, due to linearity of \u2217, and therefore of , the zero vector is its own preimage. Hence, is onto \u210b and we conclude that is unitary."
