1. **Investigate the effect of different DOTAP concentrations on the stability and release kinetics of β-ionone liposomes.** This could be done by varying the DOTAP concentration in the liposome formulation and measuring the particle size, zeta potential, and calcein release profile over time. This information could be used to optimize the liposome formulation for maximum stability and controlled release of β-ionone.


2. **Evaluate the in vivo efficacy of β-ionone liposomes in animal models of cancer.** This could be done by administering β-ionone liposomes to animals bearing cancer tumors and measuring tumor growth, survival, and other relevant endpoints. This information could be used to determine the therapeutic potential of β-ionone liposomes in vivo.


3. **Explore the use of β-ionone liposomes for co-delivery of multiple therapeutic agents.** This could be done by encapsulating two or more drugs into β-ionone liposomes and evaluating their synergistic effects in vitro and in vivo. This approach could be used to develop more effective combination therapies for cancer.


4. **Investigate the potential of β-ionone liposomes for targeted delivery to cancer cells.** This could be done by modifying the liposome surface with targeting ligands that specifically bind to cancer cells. This approach could be used to improve the delivery of β-ionone to cancer cells and reduce systemic toxicity.


5. **Develop stimuli-responsive β-ionone liposomes that release their payload in response to specific triggers.** This could be done by incorporating stimuli-responsive materials into the liposome membrane. This approach could be used to control the release of β-ionone in response to changes in pH, temperature, or other environmental cues.
