1. **Longitudinal Study of Online Gambling Behavior During and After the Pandemic:** Conduct a longitudinal study to track the online gambling behaviors of individuals over a longer period, including both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. This would provide insights into the long-term effects of the pandemic on online gambling patterns and help identify factors that contribute to sustained changes in gambling behavior.


2. **Exploration of Financial Impacts and Gambling Motivation:** Investigate the relationship between financial impacts due to the pandemic, financially focused self-concept, and gambling behavior in more depth. Examine how these factors interact to influence gambling involvement and problem gambling severity.


3. **Subgroup Analysis of Gambling Behavior:** Conduct a more detailed analysis of the three subgroups identified in the study to better understand their unique characteristics and gambling patterns. Explore potential differences in demographics, personality traits, and gambling preferences among the subgroups.


4. **Impact of Online Gambling on Mental Health:** Investigate the causal relationship between online gambling and mental health problems. Design studies that manipulate online gambling exposure or participation to determine whether it directly affects mental health outcomes.


5. **Development of Targeted Prevention and Intervention Strategies:** Use the findings from the study to develop targeted prevention and intervention strategies for individuals at risk of developing gambling problems during and after the pandemic. Evaluate the effectiveness of these strategies in reducing gambling-related harms.
