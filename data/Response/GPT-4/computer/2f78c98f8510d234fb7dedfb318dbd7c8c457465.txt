Development of Adaptive Human Feedback Models: Investigate and model different forms of adaptive human feedback mechanisms during pHRI. This research could explore how robots can interpret nuanced human inputs, such as varying pressure or directional guidance, and adapt their behavior dynamically. The goal would be to improve the robot's ability to understand and respond to less explicit human instructions during complex tasks.

Generalization of Task Learning Across Different Domains: Extend the proposed framework to learn and generalize across a wider range of tasks and domains, beyond pouring and manipulation tasks. Research could focus on developing generalized functional modules that enable robots to apply learned skills and objectives to new tasks with minimal additional training, enhancing the versatility of robots in human environments.

Enhancing Task Goal Inference with Deep Learning: Incorporate deep learning techniques to enhance the inference of task goals from human actions. This could involve developing neural network architectures that process and interpret complex sensory inputs from human-robot interactions, potentially improving the accuracy and efficiency of task goal inference and enabling robots to handle more intricate tasks with greater autonomy.

User Studies on Human-Robot Collaboration Efficiency: Conduct comprehensive user studies to assess the efficiency, effectiveness, and user satisfaction of human-robot collaboration using the proposed framework. These studies would provide valuable insights into the practical implications of the framework in real-world scenarios, identifying areas for improvement and potential impacts on workflow optimization in various industries.

Investigation of Ethical and Safety Implications in pHRI: Explore the ethical and safety implications of advanced pHRI systems that can infer and align with human objectives. Research in this area could focus on developing guidelines and safety protocols to ensure that interactions remain safe and beneficial for humans, especially as robots become capable of more autonomous decision-making based on inferred human intentions.
