    "abstractText": "Within the framework of NRQCD, we calculate the production of the excited doubly heavy baryons \u039ebQ through the semi-inclusive production process t \u2192 hbQi1\u20442n \u2192 \u039ebQ \u00fe Q\u0304\u00feW\u00fe, where Q 1\u20444 b or c quark. The intermediate diquark state hbQi1\u20442n is in the excited P-wave state, including 1\u20442P1 and 1\u20442PJ (J 1\u20444 0; 1; or 2) in both color anitriplet state 3\u0304 and color sixtuplet state 6; that is, hbci1\u20442P1 3\u0304=6, hbci1\u20442PJ 3\u0304=6, hbbi1\u20442P1 3\u0304, and hbbi1\u20442PJ 6. We find that the contributions from the P-wave states are about one order lower than the S-wave contributions, and this conclusion is consistent with others. We also analyze the invariant mass and angle differential distributions, and the theoretical uncertainty from the mass parameters, the transition probability, and the renormalization scale. Finally, we can expect that about 1.14 \u00d7 103\u20135 events of excited \u039ebc and 2.47 \u00d7 101\u20133 events of excited \u039ebb can be produced per year at the LHC with L 1\u20444 1034\u201336 cm\u22122s\u22121.",

DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevD.107.014006\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe quark model [1\u20134] theoretically predicts the existence of doubly heavy baryons, whose constituent quarks are two heavy quarks (b or c) with one light quark (u, d, or s). The study of doubly heavy baryons is an important part of hadron research and also one of the major topics in QCD research for its rich physical information. Since the first discovery of the doubly heavy baryon \u039e\u00fe\u00fecc by the LHCb Collaboration of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in 2017 [5], amounts of works have studied the properties of the doubly heavy baryon. At present, the production of doubly heavy baryons have been analyzed by the direct production, such as at the e\u00fee\u2212 colliders [6\u20139], the hadronic production [10\u201319], in deeply inelastic ep scattering [20], the photoproduction mechanisms [11,21\u201323], the heavy-ion collisions [24,25], and the indirect production via top quark decays, Higgs decays and Z boson decays [26\u201328], etc.\nAmong the indirect production mechanisms, the top quark decay is intriguing because it is the heaviest known fermion with a mass of 173.0 GeV. The top quark can participate in all interactions, especially strong interactions, and its decay occurs mainly through weak interactions via the process t \u2192 b\u00feW\u00fe. Therefore, the production of doubly heavy baryon through top quark decays is very useful for high-precision physics in the electroweak sector. With the advantage of high luminosity and high-collision energy, the LHC or a high luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) has already become a huge \u201ctop factory\u201d, in which sizable amounts of doubly heavy baryon events through top quark decays can be produced. Thus, the top quark decays will be a potentially good platform for studying the indirect production mechanism of the doubly heavy baryons and for searching the \u039ebc and \u039ebb baryons that have remained undetected by experiment so far. The nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) [29,30] is a very\npractical theory to deal with the processes involving doubly heavy hadrons. According to NRQCD, the doubly heavy baryon can be expanded into a series of Fock states with velocity v, where v stands for the typical relative velocity of two heavy quarks in the low-energy interactions. The highenergy interactions can be calculated by perturbative QCD. To be specific, the production of \u039ebQ via top-quark decays can be factorized into two parts, one is the hard process that produces the intermediate diquark state hbQi (Q stands for b or c quark), which can be calculated perturbatively, and *mahonghao@pku.edu.cn \u2020Corresponding author. niujj@gxnu.edu.cn \u2021zhengxc@cqu.edu.cn Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

The second part can be depicted by a nonperturbative matrix element, which is proportional to the transition probability from the diquark state to the baryon \u039ebQ. The nonperturbative matrix elements can be approximately related to the Schr\u00f6dinger wave function at the origin j\u03a8bQ\u00f00\u00dej for S-wave states, and the derivative wave function at the origin j\u03a80bQ\u00f00\u00dej for P-wave states. j\u03a8bQ\u00f00\u00dej and j\u03a80bQ\u00f00\u00dej can be derived from the experiment or some nonperturbative methods like the potential model [31,32], lattice QCD [33], or QCD sum rules [34]. Because these nonperturbative matrix elements can be treated as an overall parameters, we would concentrated on the essential perturbative part t \u2192 hbQi\u00bdn \u00fe Q\u0304\u00feW\u00fe for the production of the doubly heavy baryons \u039ebQ. Here, \u039ebQ stands for the doubly heavy baryon \u039ebQq, where Q represents the heavy constituent quark b or c, and q denotes the light u, d, or s quark, respectively. Thus, the study of the doubly heavy baryons can help us to achieve a deeper understanding of the QCD in both perturbative and nonperturbative regions. Pioneer investigations on the research of excited P-wave state have been analyzed for the production of mesons [35\u201338] and the doubly heavy baryons via W\u00fe boson decays [39]. In our previous work, the relevant contributions for the\nproduction of the doubly heavy baryons from the ordinary S-wave, namely ground state of intermediate diquark states, including hbci\u00bd1S0 3\u0304=6, hbci\u00bd3S1 3\u0304=6, hbbi\u00bd1S0 6, and hbbi\u00bd3S1 3\u0304, have been discussed. There will be about 2.25 \u00d7 104\u20136 events of \u039ebc and 9.49 \u00d7 102\u20134 events of \u039ebb produced in one operation year through top quark decays at the LHC or HL-LHC with L\u00bc1034\u201336 cm\u22122s\u22121. Therefore, there are enough baryon events produced experimentally. For further precise study and analysis, in the following we shall study the production of highlyexcited doubly heavy baryons, which come from the excitation of the intermediate diquark state. Similar to S-wave intermediate diquarks, the color state of the excited P-wave can be 3\u0304 or 6 because of the decomposition of SU\u00f03\u00deC color group. The spin state of the excited P-wave can be \u00bd1P1 or \u00bd3PJ (J \u00bc 0; 1; or 2). However, there are only four spin and color configurations for the P-wave state \u039ebb, i.e., \u00bd1P1 3\u0304 and \u00bd3PJ 6 due to the symmetry of identical particles in the diquark state. While there are eight spin and color configurations for the P-wave of \u039ebc, \u00bd1P1 3\u0304=6 and \u00bd3PJ 3\u0304=6. All the spin and color configurations of the intemediated diquark states in P-wave, hbci\u00bd1P1 3\u0304=6, hbci\u00bd3PJ 3\u0304=6, hbbi\u00bd1P1 3\u0304, and hbbi\u00bd3PJ 6 would be taken into consideration for a further sound prediction. A careful\nstudy on the excited \u039ebQ production shall be helpful for confirming the contributions from the P-wave states and for further testing of the quark model and NRQCD. The remaining parts of this paper are organized as\nfollows. In Sec. II, we present the detailed calculation technology for the production of \u039ebQ in P-wave states through top quark decays within the framework of NRQCD. Then the total decay widths, differential distributions and theoretical uncertainty are given in Sec. III. Section IV is reserved for the summary."

Within the framework of NRQCD, the nonperturbative matrix element hOH\u00bdn i can be considered as the transition probability from hbQi\u00bdn to \u039ebQ. For the production of \u039ebQ, similar to S-wave intermediate diquark hbQi, the color quantum number of the excited P-wave diquark can be also 3\u0304 or 6 for the decomposition of SU\u00f03\u00deC color group 3 \u2297 3 \u00bc 3\u0304\u2a016.

Here v is the relative velocity between the two heavy quarks inside \u039ebQ in the rest frame of the baryon. While others indicate that these two parameters h6 and h3\u0304 are of the same order of v [13,41] following the naive NRQCD power counting rule. Thus, for convenience and to reduce the selection of parameters, we assume h6 \u2243 h3\u0304 in the numerical calculation."

            "text": "In this subsection the theoretical uncertainty for the production of \u039ebQ are discussed. There are three main sources of theoretical uncertainty, namely mass parameters, transition probability and the renormalization scale.\nThe theoretical uncertainty caused by the mass of heavy quark (mc, mb, and mt) and W\u00fe boson would be given priority consideration. For the production of \u039ebc, heavy quark masses mc, mb, and mt are all the error sources of theoretical uncertainties, which are shown in Tables III\u2013V, respectively. However, as for the production of \u039ebb, there are only two main sources of heavy quark mass uncertainty, i.e.,mb andmt, and they are also shown in Tables IVand V, respectively. To estimate the uncertainties, we adopt mc \u00bc 1.8 0.3 GeV, mb \u00bc 5.1 0.4 GeV, and mt \u00bc 173.0 0.4 GeV. From Tables III\u2013V, one can find that: (a) The decay width for the production of excited \u039ebc\nbaryon is more sensitive to mc than mb and mt, because the suppression of phase space, \u0393\u039ebc\u00bdn de-\n014006-8\ncreases with the increments of mc. Due to the influence of the projector in Eq. (7) and the polarization tensors sum formula in Eqs. (12)\u2013(14), the decay width of excited \u039ebc in the \u00bd3P2 3\u0304=6 state increases with the increment of mb, while the others decrease with the increment of mb. (b) For the production of excited \u039ebb, the decay width is more sensitive to mb than mt, and the uncertainty effect from mt is small enough to be ignored. The decay width decreases with the increment ofmb for the suppression of phase space.\nBased on the recent difference of the W boson mass with a significance of 7.0\u03c3 between the CDF-II and the standard model [44], we also calculate its mass uncertainty, and finally find that it has a negligible impact on the final results. Therefore, the theoretical uncertainty for the production of \u039ebQ caused by W\u00fe boson mass would not be shown in this paper. Then, the theoretical uncertainty caused by the transition\nprobability h6 shall be discussed. Based on those two different points of view mentioned in Sec. II B about the contributions of diquark in color 3\u0304 and 6 state, the total produced \u039ebQ events would be roughly estimated at the LHC in one operation year with h6 \u00bc 0, or h6 \u00bc v2h3\u0304 with v2 \u00bc \u00f00.1 \u2212 0.3\u00de, and the corresponding results, along with those obtained with h6 \u00bc h3\u0304 for comparison, are presented in Table VI. Nevertheless, the uncertainty effect from the transition probability can be easily estimated when a relatively reliable value of h6 appears, because it is proportional to the decay width for the production of doubly heavy baryon \u039ebQ within the NRQCD framework.\nTABLE VII. The theoretical uncertainty for the production of \u039ebQ (in units 10\u22127 GeV) caused by the renormalization scale \u03bcr.

Obviously, the selection of renormalization scale \u03bcr can cause great uncertainty. However, such a scale ambiguity could be suppressed by a higher-order perturbative calculation or principle of maximum conformal scale-setting method (PMC) [45\u201350]. Fortunately, different renormalization scales only affect the strong coupling constant, which is proportional to the decay width. So its uncertainty effect can be easily estimated."

            "heading": "IV. SUMMARY",
            "text": "In this paper, the production of excited doubly heavy baryons \u039ebQ are analyzed through the process t \u2192 \u039ebQ \u00fe Q\u0304\u00feW\u00fe (Q \u00bc b or c) within the framework of NRQCD. In the numerical calculation, all the possible intermediate P-wave diquark states with spin and color quantum number, i.e., hbci\u00bd1P1 3\u0304=6, hbci\u00bd3PJ 3\u0304=6, hbbi\u00bd1P1 3\u0304, and hbbi\u00bd3PJ 6 have been taken into consideration. By summing up all the contributions from these diquark states, the decay width for the P-wave \u039ebc and \u039ebb are 16.96 KeVand 0.365 KeV, respectively. We observe that the contribution from P-wave states is 5.05% (2.58%) of that from S-wave states for the production of \u039ebc (\u039ebb). The contribution of P-wave can be regarded as the higher-order contribution of S-wave. The differential distributions, such as d\u0393=ds12, d\u0393=ds23, d\u0393=d cos \u03b813, and d\u0393=d cos \u03b812, are presented to show the characteristics of this process for the excited \u039ebc and \u039ebb production and be helpful for the experiments measurements. From these distributions, it can be found that when the outgoing \u039ebQ and antiquark Q\u0304 move in the same direction, and both of them move back to back with W\u00fe boson, the differential decay width can achieve its largest value. The decay width coming from the intermediate P-wave\ndiquark states can be obtained in the following:\n\u0393t\u2192\u039ebc\u00bdP \u00fec\u0304\u00feW\u00fe \u00bc 16.96\u00fe25.64\u221212.66 KeV; \u0393t\u2192\u039ebb\u00bdP \u00feb\u0304\u00feW\u00fe \u00bc 0.365\u00fe0.668\u22120.124 KeV;\nwhere the uncertainties come from the heavy quark masses (mb, mc, and mt), and the renormalization scale \u03bcr. The decay width for the production of \u039ebc (\u039ebb) is more sensitive to mc (mb) than other sources of the theoretical uncertainty, which is mainly caused by the change of phase space. Because of the running behavior of strong coupling constant \u03b1s\u00f0\u03bcr\u00de, the selection of the renormalization scale\n\u03bcr has a big difference in the decay width through this process. Fortunately, the decay width at the leading order is proportional to the strong coupling constant \u03b1s and the uncertainty effect induced by the renormalization scale \u03bcr can be estimated easily. If all these excited P-wave doubly heavy baryons decay\ninto the ground state completely, we can obtain the total decay width\n\u0393t\u2192\u039ebc\u00fec\u0304\u00feW\u00fe \u00bc 352.66\u00fe306.14\u2212237.36 KeV; \u0393t\u2192\u039ebb\u00feb\u0304\u00feW\u00fe \u00bc 14.50\u00fe20.33\u22123.42 KeV:\nIn this case of a combination of S- and P-wave contributions, there will be about 2.36 \u00d7 104\u22126 \u039ebc events and 9.73 \u00d7 102\u22124 \u039ebb events produced in one operation year at the LHC with a high luminosity L \u00bc 1034\u201336 cm\u22122 s\u22121. Therefore, there are still sizable events of \u039ebc and \u039ebb baryons produced at the LHC in one operation year. With so many events, the experimental signals will possibly be found at the LHC in the future. And at the future e\u00fee\u2212 colliders with clean background, high luminosity and high collision energy, a huge number of top quark will be produced. With the help of Eq. (21) and our results, the events for the produced \u039ebc and \u039ebb baryons can be estimated at the future e\u00fee\u2212 colliders. It is worth mentioning that the isospin-breaking effect is ignored in this paper. That is to say \u039ebc denotes \u039e\u00febcu, \u039e0bcd and \u03a90bcs and \u039ebb denotes \u039e0bbu, \u039e\u2212bbd and \u03a9\u2212bbs. Because the intermediate diquark state hbQi needs to grab a light u, d, or s quark in the vacuum to form the doubly heavy baryon \u039ebQ accordingly. According to the ratio for the production of \u039ebQu, \u039ebQd, and \u03a9bQs is 1\u22361\u22360.3 [51], there will be about 43% \u039ebc events become \u039e\u00febc, 43% to \u039e0bc, and 14% to \u03a90bc, and the same percentage for \u039ebc events become \u039e0bb, \u039e\u2212bb, and \u03a9\u2212bb."
