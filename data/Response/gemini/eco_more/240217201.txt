1. **Investigate the impact of different OE models on the performance of the proposed market mechanism.** The paper considers a specific OE model where the OEs are imposed at the community revenue meter. However, other OE models are possible, such as imposing OEs at the individual member meters or using a more sophisticated model that takes into account the network topology. It would be interesting to investigate how the choice of OE model affects the performance of the proposed market mechanism.
2. **Develop a distributed algorithm for implementing the proposed market mechanism.** The paper presents a centralized algorithm for implementing the proposed market mechanism. However, it would be more efficient to develop a distributed algorithm that can be implemented by the community members themselves. This would allow the community to operate in a more decentralized manner and would reduce the computational burden on the community operator.
3. **Extend the proposed market mechanism to consider other types of DERs.** The paper considers a community with only solar PV DERs. However, it would be interesting to extend the proposed market mechanism to consider other types of DERs, such as wind turbines, batteries, and electric vehicles. This would allow the community to take advantage of a wider range of resources and would make the community more resilient to fluctuations in renewable generation.
4. **Investigate the impact of the proposed market mechanism on the distribution network.** The paper does not consider the impact of the proposed market mechanism on the distribution network. However, it is possible that the market mechanism could have a significant impact on the network, such as by reducing peak demand or increasing voltage stability. It would be interesting to investigate the impact of the market mechanism on the network and to develop mitigation strategies for any negative impacts.
5. **Develop a pilot program to test the proposed market mechanism.** The paper presents a theoretical analysis of the proposed market mechanism. However, it would be valuable to test the market mechanism in a real-world setting. This could be done through a pilot program in which a community implements the market mechanism and evaluates its performance. The results of the pilot program could be used to refine the market mechanism and to develop best practices for its implementation.
