    "abstractText": "Background: Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced renal injury is a common reason for kidney injury in clinical settings; therefore, continuous investigation of novel nephroprotective agents is crucial. Myrrh, the oleoresin exudates generated by the genus Commiphora, display numerous pharmacological actions. This study tried to assess the preventive effects of myrrh essential oil against I/R-induced renal damage. Methods: Rats were randomized into five groups. In the sham group, the animals were subjected to bilateral renal artery separation with no occlusion. In the sham + myrrh group; the rats were administered myrrh essential oil and then treated similarly to the sham group. Renal I/R group: the animals were challenged with renal I/R. In the myrrh + renal I/R groups, rats were administered 50 or 100 mg/kg of myrrh essential oil orally for three weeks before being confronted with I/R. Results: Serum levels of renal function tests and renal injury biomarkers, including NGAL, KIM-1, and CysC, were amplified in the renal I/R group. Animals that experienced renal I/R exhibited elevated lipid peroxidation (MDA); declined SOD, CAT, and GPx activity; declined GSH content; augmented TLR4/NF\u03baB gene expression; and subsequent enhancement of inflammatory mediators (TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6). Myrrh reduced renal function tests and injury biomarkers and amended renal histological alterations. Pretreatment with myrrh reduced MDA, elevated the antioxidant enzymes\u2019 activities and GSH content, and reduced the TLR4 and NF\u03baB gene expression, leading to subsequent inflammation and apoptosis alleviation. Conclusions: The outcomes of the present investigation established the protective effect of myrrh essential oil against renal I/R via pointing out the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic",

            "text": "Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced renal injury is a common reason for acute kidney injury that frequently occurs in clinical settings [1]. Treatment of acute kidney injury is mainly supportive treatment that affects the survivors\u2019 quality of life, who may endure long-term outcomes, such as chronic kidney disease [2]. Ischemia, caused by clamping the renal vessels, reduces the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the renal tissue, whereas reperfusion worsens the state of oxidation and inflammation, resulting in necrosis and/or apoptosis [3]. The pathogenesis of I/R-induced renal damage is exceptionally complex, comprising intricate and interrelated events, including renal tubular damage, inflammation, oxidative stress, and vascular dysfunction, which ultimately lead to renal cell death [4]. Oxidative stress, directly and indirectly, manipulates several pathways leading to apoptosis, necrosis, fibrosis, and tissue damage progression, and eventually may result in renal dysfunction [5]. Additionally, excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induces an inflammatory response, which in turn causes leukocyte adhesion and migration to the ischemic area following the reperfusion [6,7]. Therefore, continuous exploration of\nCurr. Issues Mol. Biol. 2023, 45, 1183\u20131196. https://doi.org/10.3390/cimb45020078 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/cimb\nCurr. Issues Mol. Biol. 2023, 45 1184\nnovel possible nephroprotective agents, especially plants or naturally occurring compounds, is indispensable. Natural constituents derived from plants have played a substantial role in drug discovery. Numerous plants\u2019 secondary metabolites were explored to recognize novel compounds which showed several pharmacological actions, such as antifungal, antibacterial [8], and anticancer activities, among others [9]. Commiphora molmol (family Burseraceae) is a small thorny tree commonly distributed in Africa and Asia. Myrrh is the oleoresin exudate generated by the genus Commiphora [10]. One of the main components of Myrrh is the essential oil, which comprises 2 to 8% of the gum resin\u2019s constituents. The essential oil comprises many compounds, especially of the sesquiterpenes type, particularly \u03b2-elemene, \u03b4-elemene, \u03b2-bourbonene, \u03b1-bergamotene, germacrene A and B, furanoeudesma-1,3-diene, lindestren, and curzerene [11,12]. Myrrh\u2019 oleoresin has been extensively used in wound-healing commercial products [10,13]. It showed numerous pharmacological actions, including analgesic [14], anti-inflammatory [14,15], anti-hyperlipidemic [14,16], antioxidant [15,17], anti-hyperglycemic [17], hepatoprotective [18], anti-osteoporotic [13], anti-ulcer [19], antiparasitic [20] antiviral [21], and anti-cancer [22] activity. Furthermore, myrrh alleviated ethanol-induced oxidative alterations of gastric ulceration [23], scopolamine-induced memory impairments [24], monosodium iodoacetateinduced osteoarthritis [25], and silicate-induced immune-mediated glomerulonephritis [26]. As for the protective action of myrrh against ischemia, an earlier study demonstrated the protective effects of myrrh essential oil on isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction in rats [27]. Regarding renal actions, pre-treatment with C. molmol resin extract prevented methotrexate-induced kidney injury and attenuated oxidative stress and inflammation [28]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study exploring the protective activity of myrrh essential oil against renal I/R-induced injury. Therefore, in the current study, we tried to assess the protective effects of myrrh essential oil against I/R-induced renal damage with respect to its influence on the expression of the inflammatory and apoptotic markers and antioxidant activities. Moreover, this study investigated in more depth the mechanism of action of myrrh essential oil, proposing TLR4/ NF-\u03baB as a pathway that might elucidate myrrh\u2019s beneficial reno-protective effect."

Two pathologists (blinded to the experiment) evaluated different kidney sections with a specific scale to assess the renal tubulointerstitial damage grade using at least ten fields for each renal section. The scoring scale designated 0 (no damage), 1 (less than 10%), 2 (11\u201325%), 3 (26\u201345%), 4 (46\u201375%), and 5 (more than 76%) as indicated before by Tan et al. [30]. As for the immunohistochemistry technique, the expression of TLR4 and NF\u03baB was inspected as decribed previously [31]. Renal sections were blocked using 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol and washed with PBS three times. Then, the sections were incubated with TLR4 and NF\u03baB antibodies (1:100, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cambridge, UK) overnight at 4 \u25e6C, followed by the addition of the goat anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated IgG antibody (1:1000; Cat. no. ab6721; Abcam, Eugene, OR, USA) for 1 h at 37 \u25e6C. Finally, the tissue sections were developed with 1% diaminobenzidine, counterstained with 1% hematoxylin, and mounted with neutral gum. A microscope equipped with a digital camera was utilized to capture the renal sections. NIS-Elements software was used for quantitative analysis. The area of the immunohistochemistry reaction was selected, and then the average optical density in the designated area of each photograph was assessed.

In the current study, the MDA level exhibited a significant elevation in animals that exhibited renal I/R compared to sham groups. In comparison, pretreatment with myrrh essential oil (50 and 100 mg/kg) caused a reduction in the MDA level (42.14% and 56.87%, respectively) compared to the renal I/R group. One of the main contributors to I/R-induced renal damage is oxidative stress [36]. In the current study, rats that experienced I/R demonstrated markedly declined SOD, CAT, and GPx enzyme activities and GSH content in renal tissue. Myrrh (50 and 100 mg/kg) enhanced the activities SOD, CAT, and GPx, and increased GSH content in renal tissue (p < 0.05), as displayed in Figure 3. All these results indicate that myrrh deterred renal oxidative stress subsequent to renal I/R via augmenting antioxidant enzymes\u2019 activities and GSH content, and lowering the MDA level."

Ischemia-reperfus on (I/R) injury is t e leading cause of acute kidney injury, during which a rapid deterioration in renal function occurs, causing high morbidity and mortality among patients [39,40]. In the current study, serum levels of Cr, BUN, uric acid, and LDH were\nCurr. Issues Mol. Biol. 2023, 45 1192\namplified in the renal I/R group compared to the sham group. Myrrh improved renal function though, as displayed by the depressed serum levels of Cr, BUN, uric acid, and LDH. Furthermore, myrrh essential oil deterred renal injury biomarkers by decreasing serum levels of NGAL, KIM-1, and CysC; and amended renal histological alterations associated with renal I/R. NGAL is an early biomarker of AKI that is manufactured in the distal nephron, and its synthesis is elevated as a response to renal injury [41,42]. Furthermore, recent studies revealed that an elevated NGAL level is a risk factor for oxidative stress in hemodialysis patients [43]. These outcomes designate that myrrh essential oil administration prior to renal I/R may limit renal deterioration caused by I/R. Similarly, an earlier study showed that myrrh provided protection against methotrexate-induced acute kidney injury, as evidenced by decreasing renal function tests [28]. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms involved in renal I/R include the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS), generation of pro-inflammatory mediators, calcium overload, activation of apoptotic genes [3], and vascular dysfunction [44]. ROS has a detrimental effect on the kidney tissues, thereby playing a decisive role in the renal injury pathophysiological processes. Oxygen radicals triggered by I/R cause lipid peroxidation and destroy cell and organelle membranes, thereby disturbing the renal tissue structure and function [45]. The results of the current study displayed an elevation in the lipid peroxidation (MDA) level, accompanied by lowered SOD, CAT, and GPx enzyme activity, and GSH content, in renal tissue in animals that experienced renal I/R. However, pretreatment with myrrh essential oil (50 and 100 mg/kg) caused a reduction in lipid peroxidation (MDA), together with increases in SOD, CAT, and GPx enzymes\u2019 activities and an increase in GSH content in renal tissue. All these results together indicate that myrrh deterred renal oxidative stress subsequent to renal I/R via augmenting antioxidant enzymes\u2019 activities, GSH content, and lowering the level of MDA\u2014in harmony with earlier reports which showed that Commiphora molmol attenuated oxidative stress in diverse diseases such as tilmicosin-induced cardiotoxicity [46], ethanol-induced gastric ulceration [23], acetic acid-induced ulcerative colitis [15], hyperammonemia [47], and diethylnitrosamine/phenobarbital-induced hepatocarcinogenesis [48], among other animal disease models. In terms of inflammation, ischemia-induced hypoxia in the renal tissue leads to the vigorous local production of inflammatory cytokines [49]. These cytokines can initiate defensive physiological activities to isolate and inhibit tissue damage and/or further aggravate organ damage and dysfunction by inducing free radicals to produce and recruit inflammatory cells [26]. I/R generates numerous damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) proteins, which signal through TLRs, mainly TLR4, to activate numerous inflammatory mediators [37]. NF\u03baB is one of the essential downstream effectors of the TLR4 signaling [50]. TLR4/NF\u03baB pathway activation enhances pro-inflammatory responses, thereby elevating several inflammatory markers [51,52]. At the same time, IL-10 suppresses the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, renal dysfunction, and the expression of pro-apoptosis factors after I/R [53]. In the current study, TLR4 and NF\u03baB gene expression were significantly augmented in the renal I/R group. As a result of TLR4 and NF\u03baB activation, renal levels of TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 were greatly amplified in animals that experienced I/R. Numerous earlier studies exposed the activation of the TLR4/NF\u03baB pathway as an essential pathway responsible for the damage happening during I/R, and that suppressing the TLR4/NF\u03baB pathway revealed renal protection from injury caused by I/R [54\u201356]. On the other hand, myrrh administration prior to renal I/R evidently deterred TLR4 and NF\u03baB gene expression, leading to subsequent drops in TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 renal levels. Moreover, myrrh noticeably augmented the IL-10 level, indicating that the essential oil deterred the TLR4/NF\u03baB pathway, resulting in the mitigation of renal inflammation. These outcomes are in agreement with earlier studies that verified the anti-inflammatory effects of myrrh against formalin-induced paw edema [14], ovariectomyinduced bone loss [13], monosodium iodoacetate-induced osteoarthritis [25], wound heal-\nCurr. Issues Mol. Biol. 2023, 45 1193\ning [57], and silicate induced immune-mediated glomerulonephritis [26]. Additionally, animals experimented with renal I/R surgery presented exaggerated apoptosis, comprising enhanced Bax gene expression, and reduced Bcl2 gene expression. Pretreatment with myrrh essential oil resulted in apoptosis alleviation, as established by lowered Bax and increased Bcl2 gene expression levels, confirming the anti-apoptotic effect of the oil. Similarly, pretreatment with myrrh exhibited an anti-apoptotic effect via up-regulating Bcl-2 in the kidney of methotrexate-induced renal toxicity rats [38]. Several natural oils, such as lavender oil [58], and natural compounds, such as senkyunolide I [59], attenuated renal I/R injury via suppressing apoptosis."

Additionally, pretreatment with myrrh essential oil inhibited the TLR4/NF-\u03baB pathway, a mechanism that might be behind myrrh\u2019s beneficial protective effect. Inhibiting the TLR4/NF-\u03baB pathway was reflected by reductions in multiple inflammatory and apoptotic markers.
