The change in the slope of\nthe electrically evoked compound action potentials (eCAP), amplitude growth\nfunction (AGF) as a response to increased interphase gap (IPG) (IPGEslope) has been introduced as a potential measure of cochlear health. Although this measure\nhas been widely used in research, its relationship to other parameters requires\nfurther investigation.\nMethods: This study investigated the relationship between IPGEslope, demographics and speech intelligibility by (1) considering the relative importance\nof each frequency band to speech perception, and (2) investigating the effect\nof the stimulus polarity of the stimulating pulse. The eCAPs were measured in\nthree different conditions: (1) Forward masking with anodic-leading (FMA) pulse,\n(2) Forward masking with cathodic-leading (FMC) pulse, and (3) with alternating\npolarity (AP). This allowed the investigation of the effect of polarity on the\ndiagnosis of cochlear health. For an accurate investigation of the correlation\nbetween IPGEslope and speech intelligibility, a weighting function was applied to the measured IPGEslopes on each electrode in the array to consider the relative importance of each frequency band for speech perception. A weighted\nPearson correlation analysis was also applied to compensate for the effect\nof missing data by giving higher weights to the ears with more successful\nIPGEslope measurements.\nResults: A significant correlation was observed between IPGEslope and speech perception in both quiet and noise for between-subject data especially when the\nrelative importance of frequency bands was considered. A strong and significant\ncorrelation was also observed between IPGEslope and age when stimulation was performed with cathodic-leading pulses but not for the anodic-leading\npulse condition.\nFrontiers in Integrative Neuroscience 01 frontiersin.org\nConclusion: Based on the outcome of this study it can be concluded that\nIPGEslope has potential as a relevant clinical measure indicative of cochlear health and its relationship to speech intelligibility. The polarity of the stimulating pulse\ncould influence the diagnostic potential of IPGEslope.\nKEYWORDS\ncochlear implant, cochlear health, speech recognition, neural degeneration, band importance function, age"

            "text": "Cochlear implants (CIs) are the treatment of choice to restore hearing in patients with severe to profound hearing loss (HL). The success of the treatment depends on individual factors such as the cognitive abilities of the patient or the reaction of the immune system to the implant, as well as on implant type and the depth of insertion of the electrode array. One influential factor is the condition of the cochlea \u2013Specifically the survival and the physiological status of the spiral ganglion neurons (SGN). Although the importance of this factor is clear, relevant data are sparse.\nSpiral ganglion neurons are the target neurons for electrical stimulation with cochlear implants. Large variations have been documented in the number and condition of surviving SGNs in CI recipients, and this could contribute to the similarly large variability in auditory performance observed (Seyyedi et al., 2014). The parameters describing the status of the auditory nerve include the number of SGNs (neural count), the presence, density, and myelination of their peripheral processes (PP), and metabolic and genetic factors. In this paper, we will use \u201ccochlear health\u201d as a generally inclusive term to encompass all of these parameters.\nSome of the early attempts to correlate speech recognition in CI users with cochlear health used post-mortem histology of the temporal bone. These studies showed either negative (Nadol et al., 2001) or no correlation (Khan et al., 2005) between residual SGN counts and word recognition. Potential reasons for the lack of correlation include the long duration between speech recognition testing and histological analysis, the limited datasets, the use of pooled data across the electrode array, the use of only neural count, excluding condition, and the inter-individual differences in cognitive abilities. Seyyedi et al. (2014) presented the first study data which showed a positive correlation between the number of surviving SGNs and word recognition score. In a within-subject comparison of left and right ears, eliminating any between-subject confounding factors, the number of SGNs was consistently higher in the ear which produced the better word recognition scores. Despite the positive correlation observed between cochlear health and auditory performance in CI users, several of the limitations of previous studies were also present here. The study was also conducted post-mortem, the demonstrated differences were small, histological data were again pooled across the cochlea, and only very limited data were available.\nAnother aspect of cochlear health, genetic factors, can influence the function of the auditory nerve (Shearer et al., 2017; Shearer and Hansen, 2019; Usami and Nishio, 2022). Several attempts have been made to establish Cochlear Nerve Deficiency (CND) as a\nreference model for verifying cochlear health measures (He et al., 2018, 2020; Xu et al., 2020). However, these findings were not as expected, and some measures for cochlear health were found to be contrary to the initial hypothesis (Xu et al., 2020). This may be due to the pathogenesis of CND, in which the status of the auditory nerve is affected during embryogenesis (Jackler et al., 1987) and the frequent presence of concurrent neurological deficits (Huang et al., 2010). These findings may suggest that patients with CND may not be a suitable model for general investigation of cochlear health (Xu et al., 2020).\nElectrically evoked compound action potentials (eCAPs) may provide a means for the estimation of cochlear health in live individuals. The eCAP represents the synchronous ensemble activity of electrically stimulated auditory nerve fibers, and has the same neural origin as Wave I of the electrically evoked auditory brainstem response (eABR). Its primary constituents are a negative (N1) peak, which occurs at approximately 0.2\u20130.4 ms after stimulus onset, followed by a positive (P2) peak at 0.6\u2013 0.8 ms. Several characteristics of the eCAP could potentially be examined to glean information regarding cochlear health (van Eijl et al., 2017). DeVries et al. (2016) observed a negative correlation between eCAP amplitude and behavioral thresholds, and reported a tendency toward better speech perception for subjects with higher eCAP amplitude and lower behavioral thresholds. Kim et al. (2010) observed a significant correlation between the slope of eCAP amplitude growth function (AGF) and speech recognition in quiet and in noise, although only for the sub-group of participants with short electrode arrays.\nTo mitigate the site-specific variation in eCAP response caused by non-neural factors such as the distance between each electrode and its target SGNs, as well as tissue or bone growth, Prado-Guitierrez et al. (2006) introduced a method based on alteration of the interphase gap (IPG, Figure 1A). The IPG is the short zero-amplitude portion between the anodic and cathodic phases of a symmetric, charge-balanced biphasic pulse used in CIs. The effect of increasing the IPG (IPG effect, IPGE) of the stimulating pulse on eCAP characteristics has become widely used as a measure of cochlear health. Ramekers et al. (2014) measured the IPGE on different eCAP AGF characteristics such as amplitude, threshold, slope, and latency in implanted normal-hearing (NH) and pharmaceutically deafened guinea pigs to investigate the consequences of secondary degeneration of SGNs after severe hair cell loss through chemical ablation. A significant correlation between spiral ganglion cell packing density and the IPGE on some of the AGF characteristics, including slope, was shown.\nFrontiers in Integrative Neuroscience 02 frontiersin.org\nThe same method was used by Schvartz-Leyzac and Pfingst (2016) for estimation of cochlear health in human subjects. The authors measured the IPGE on the AGF slope (IPGEslope) and observed across-site profiles reflecting the local variability along the cochlea. In a subsequent study (Schvartz-Leyzac and Pfingst, 2018), each ear was represented by the across site mean (ASM) of the measured IPGEslope for all electrodes. Similarly to Seyyedi et al. (2014), by calculating the ear-difference in the IPGEslope ASM in bilateral CI users, the between-subject bias stemming from variation in central cognitive ability could be reduced. A significant correlation between ear-differences in IPGEslope and ear-differences in speech reception threshold (SRT) was shown. The approach proposed by Schvartz-Leyzac and Pfingst (2018) was challenged by Brochier et al. (2021) who investigated the IPG effect on the eCAP AGF in computational and animal models. Based on both models, they concluded that IPGEslope did not successfully control for non-neural factors. Instead, they proposed the IPGE on offset (IPGEoffset), defined as the average dB offset between the overlapping linear regions of the two eCAP AGFs obtained with a short and a long IPG (Figure 1B) that are expressed on logarithmic input-output axes. The contradictory conclusions of the two abovementioned studies emphasized on the necessity of further research to clarify the suitability of each measure for estimation of cochlear health.\nSpeech information in different frequency bands, transmitted from different sections of the cochlea to the brain, is not of equal importance (ANSI, 1997). Because of this, two ears with the same ASM of the IPGE on eCAP characteristics may differ in speech perception if the distribution of surviving SGNs differs between each cochlea. Regardless of the type of cochlear health measure, when it comes to relating the measure to speech recognition performance, any such measure may benefit from an adjustment using a band importance function that reflects the human auditory system mechanisms of speech perception.\nBetween-subject variations in the site-specific cochlear capacity for transferring speech information has been considered for other measures related to speech intelligibility. The speech intelligibility index predicts the intelligibility of speech based on the sum of speech audibility in different frequency bands multiplied by the importance of each band, which is determined by that band\u2019s contribution to the intelligibility of total speech information (ANSI, 1997). This function has been estimated in normal hearing subjects using recognition scores of successively low- and high-pass filtered speech. The importance of a band is then determined by comparing the recognition scores across two successive cutoff frequencies (Healy et al., 2013). The perception of the masked speech signal depends on the noise spectrum and differs through variations in sub-band signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) even for the same subject as reported by Pollack (1948) who measured the intelligibility of low- and high-pass filtered speech masked with white noise. The author reported a relative contribution of the various speech frequencies as a function of SNR. On the other hand, the speech perception of hearing impaired individuals with different patterns in their audiograms varies even under the same noise condition. In case of profound HL and in the absence of functional hair cells, variation in neural survival along Rosenthal\u2019s canal influences the transmission of speech in each frequency band. We therefore conclude that it may be advisable to refine the method developed by\nSchvartz-Leyzac and Pfingst (2018) and to consider the speech band importance function when relating the IPGE to speech perception.\nAnother factor that might affect the diagnostic power of the IPGE is the polarity of the stimulating pulse. Histological studies have shown that SGN degeneration occurs over an extended period of time in the human and after loss of supporting cells and degeneration of SGN PPs can also survive as monopolar neurons (Liu et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2019). Models predict that SGNs with degenerated PPs require 5 to 6 times more current than healthy neurons to respond to cathodic-leading pulses, however, this is not true for anodic-leading pulses (Rattay et al., 2001a,b; Joshi et al., 2017; Resnick et al., 2018). Single-fiber recordings (Shepherd and Javel, 1997) and investigations of pseudo-monophasic and triphasic pulses (Undurraga et al., 2010, 2013) have provided electrophysiological evidence for this hypothesis. Biophysical considerations on the effect of externally applied electrical fields on neuronal excitation assign an important role to the polarity of the stimulus (Kalkman et al., 2022). Here, a significant factor is the orientation of the neuron in relation to the orientation of the voltage gradient caused by the electric field. In general, cathodic stimulation is seen as more effective for neuronal stimulation (Rattay, 1998). The electrode generates negative potentials in the extracellular space, such that the intracellular potential is no longer negative (Brocker and Grill, 2013) and the transmembrane potential is depolarized, leading to an action potential. This is, however, dependent on the distance of the electrode to the target neuron, which in the case of CI stimulation never are in close contact and are separated by perilymph as well as multiple tissues. In an analogous way, anodic stimulation can create \u201cvirtual cathodes\u201d in locations distant from the electrode. CIs often evoke larger eCAPs with anodic stimulation (Macherey et al., 2008; Herrmann et al., 2021). Degeneration and demyelination of the SGN peripheral process effectively moves the neuron further away from the electrode, compared to a healthy SGN (Kamakura et al., 2018). Factors increasing electrode-neuron distance may be creating a preference for anodic stimulation by an electrode. The \u201cgeneralized activating function\u201d (Rattay, 1999) observes spatial and temporal local voltage changes, which depend on extracellular voltages, axonal resistance, and membrane capacitance. On a single-cell level, the simulations showed that the amount of threshold increase following the loss of the peripheral processes essentially depended on the electrode position and the polarity of the stimulus. Degeneration and demyelination of PPs is predicted by all these models to lead to more significant loss of efficiency for cathodic stimuli, due to more suitable alignment of excitable regions of the SGN and excitatory extracellularly applied potentials in the anodic case. However, often both anodic-leading and cathodic-leading stimuli are used in a single eCAP measurement and then averaged for purposes of artifact reduction (alternating polarity, AP), making a differentiated observation for single polarities impossible. The model outcomes motivated a comparison of the diagnostic potential of anodicleading stimuli versus that of cathodic- leading stimuli alone for objective assessment of cochlear health. The forward masking (FM) artifact reduction method uses two biphasic pulses with the same leading phase polarity, most commonly a cathodic-leading pulse (He et al., 2017). It is also possible to implement FM with an anodic-leading pulse. The hypothesis of this study is not directed at the polarity effect on excitability as investigated in previous\nFrontiers in Integrative Neuroscience 03 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 1 Illustration of the methods employed to calculate IPGEslope (A) and IPGEoffset (B). The eCAP AGFs obtained by IPG 2.1 and 30 \u00b5s are plotted in black and gray, respectively. In panel (A), the green lines mark the AGFs steepest slopes. In panel (B), the green horizontal lines indicate the offset between the AGFs with short and long IPGs for several N1-P2 amplitudes.\nstudies (Hughes et al., 2017, 2018; Jahn and Arenberg, 2019a,b), which focused on the average differences of the responses to anodic-leading and cathodic-leading stimuli. Instead, both polarities are investigated separately in the current study to examine the sensitivity of each polarity separately for use as an electrophysiological biomarker for SGN degeneration.\nIn summary, the goals of this study were to investigate the relationship between IPGEslope, demographics, and speech intelligibility in CI users by (1) by investigating the effect of the polarity of the stimulating pulse, and (2) considering the band importance weighting function when investigating the correlation between the speech perception measures and IPGEslope within the study."

We recruited CI users implanted with MED-EL devices to ensure compatibility with the custom-made eCAP measurement software described below. Etiology varied between subjects, with the most common etiology being progressive sensorineural HL (10 subjects, at least in one ear). All subjects were native German speakers and were stimulated in monopolar mode. For all the subjects the FS4 coding strategy was used and the lowest frequency was set to 70 Hz. Individuals whose HL was secondary to meningitis were excluded from this study, due to the reduced incidence of recordable eCAPs in this condition (Guedes et al., 2007). Subjects 7, 9, 12, and 13 suffered from progressive hearing impairment which was detected prelingually. Subjects 7 and 13 had restricted speech development and were diagnosed with mild auditory dyslalia. Electrode 12 of the right ear of subject 12 and electrodes 4 and 5 of the left ear of subject 7 were deactivated clinically. In the left ear of subject seven, the IPGEslope measurement of electrodes 3, 7, and 10 was interrupted due to the subject\u2019s complaint of an unpleasant sensation. The left ear of\nsubject seven was the only ear implanted with a relatively short electrode array (Flex24 EAS).

This method exploits the absolute refractory period of SGNs by implementing a double-pulse paradigm with a sufficiently short inter-pulse-interval.

In this study, all eCAPs were measured both with anodicleading (FMA) and with cathodic-leading (FMC) pulses, in order to investigate the polarity-specific behavior of neural responses. For each parameter set, 50 sweeps were recorded and averaged. An AP artifact reduction method was implemented by averaging the FMA and FMC probe responses. It should be noted that FMA and FMC probes were not measured consecutively, which is different to how AP is implemented in clinical software. In all cases, eCAPs were measured using two IPGs, 2.1 and 30 \u00b5s. The combination of polarities and IPGs resulted in six different conditions: FMA 2.1, FMA 30, FMC 2.1, FMC 30, (virtual) AP 2.1, and (virtual) AP 30.\nECAP recordings were performed in monopolar configuration at a rate of approximately 60 Hz using the standard stimulation ground of the implant. Recording electrodes were by default set to the next more apical active electrode relative to the stimulating electrode (n\u22121, where n is the electrode number), except for electrode 1 (the most apical electrode) which had electrode 2 as the default recording electrode. When necessary, the location of each recording electrode could be altered by the investigator to yield a clear eCAP based on visual inspection following an initial test pulse. The recording electrode was neighboring the stimulating electrode in nearly all cases. ECAP recordings were obtained with high temporal resolution (stimulator internal sampling rate 1.2 MHz). The measurement delay was set to 120 \u00b5s for stimuli with IPG = 2.1 \u00b5s and to 149 \u00b5s for stimuli with IPG = 30 \u00b5s to compensate for the different durations of the respective biphasic stimuli. Both masker and probe signals were measured with the same recording electrode pair. The masker level was 10% higher than that of the probe, except for the highest amplitude step, for\nFrontiers in Integrative Neuroscience 07 frontiersin.org\nwhich the masker was set to MAL and the probe was set to 95% of MAL. This procedure led to a smaller increase for the last stimulus step in the AGF and to potentially less effective masking, however, it ensured that MAL would not be exceeded.\nThe default phase duration was set to 30 \u00b5s and the default masker-probe interval to 350 \u00b5s, but both parameters could be adjusted by the investigator when necessary. For subjects 7 and 10 the phase duration was increased to 40 and 50 \u00b5s, respectively, to record eCAPs with sufficient reliability. Subject 14 had different phase durations in right (30 \u00b5s) and left (50 \u00b5s) ears. AGFs were recorded on all active electrodes, with 10 amplitude steps between and including threshold and MAL, as well as two sub-threshold measurements. The amplitude increment was equidistant. This resulted in a total of 576 eCAPs for each ear, in the case of 12 clinically active electrodes.\nTo further reduce the influence of the measurement noise, the recorded eCAPs were filtered with a fifth-order Butterworth lowpass filter having a cut-off frequency of 5 KHz. Zero-phase filtering was applied, which effectively doubled the filter order to ten. To avoid potential tilt of the responses, caused by remaining stimulus artifact, biasing the determination of eCAP characteristics, the filtered eCAPs were detrended. To estimate the trend, a weighted linear least-square analysis was applied to the eCAP. Each eCAP trace was divided into three equally long parts and samples within the first, second and third part were multiplied with weights of 0.1, 0.5, and 1, respectively, to emphasize the tail of the response in the estimation of the trend where the presence of the artifact is more pronounced. This allowed more accurate estimation of the trend. This estimated trend was then subtracted from the eCAP. Finally, in order to eliminate the artifact caused by internal circuitry, the response to the lowest subthreshold current level was subtracted from the detrended eCAP.\n2.7. AGF slope calculation and IPGEslope\nThe extrema of the eCAP amplitude time-course falling into the time intervals of approximately 0.02\u20130.4 ms and 0.3\u20130.8 ms were chosen to determine the N1 and P2 peaks, respectively. The earliest extremum of the corresponding time interval was chosen as the N1 peak. For the detection of P2 the extremum with the largest amplitude was selected to allow a consistent definition of the peak in cases of double peaks. The default time intervals were modified if no peak was detected, (in particular in the case of a missing N1). Absence of the N1 peak could be driven by an early response of the neurons occurring during the blanking delay and therefore hidden from the measurement system (Lai and Dillier, 2000). Therefore, in such a case, the N1 peak was defined arbitrarily as the amplitude of the signal at 0.03 ms after stimulus onset. For the selection of the P2 peak, the above-mentioned time interval was expanded toward the onset of the signal to compensate for the delay in the recording and to allow the detection of any peaks that occurred earlier than expected.\nAmplitude growth function, i.e., the N1-P2 peak amplitude difference as a function of stimulating current level, were calculated for each electrode, each IPG, each polarity and each artifact reduction approach (FM/AP). An automatic AGF selection was performed in order to only estimate AGFs with adequate reliability.\nThe criteria for AGF selection were based on the maximum eCAP amplitude (the N1-P2 peak-amplitude for highest current level must be larger than 120 \u00b5V), impedance of the stimulating electrode (must be lower than 10 k ), monotonicity of the AGF and the comparison between the maximal AGF slope and the slope of a line fitted to the first three points of the AGFs (the response to the subthreshold and threshold currents) as an estimation of the artifact. For the last criterion, the slope difference should be larger than 0.5 (\u00b5V/ \u00b5A) unless the slope of the line fitted to the eCAP amplitude measured with subthreshold and threshold currents was smaller than 0.3 (\u00b5V/ \u00b5A), indicating a mild level of artifact.\nThe AGF slopes were estimated according to the window method introduced by Skidmore et al. (2022). The input was converted to charge (nC). ECAP AGFs were resampled at 13 data points to handle the non-uniformly sampled data in the original AGF. Subsequently, first order linear functions were fitted to different subsections of the resampled AGF and the slope of the steepest linear function was determined as the slope of the eCAP AGF. Each subset consisted of four points of the resampled AGF, with overlap of three points between subsequent subsets. Only the data points above the noise floor (set to 20 \u00b5V) were considered for the analysis. The final AGF slope was the maximum slope that had been determined using this moving window approach. IPGEslope was then obtained by subtracting the AGF slope calculated for IPG 2.1 \u00b5s from the AGF slope for IPG 30 \u00b5s. Figure 1 depicts two exemplary AGFs obtained with IPG 2.1 \u00b5s and IPG 30 \u00b5s and their corresponding maximum slope."

In general, the SRTs ranged between \u22125 and 12 dB SNR, with only subject 13 and subject 7L showing SRTs higher than 1 dB SNR. These two subjects were the only ones with (mild) auditory dyslalia. Subject 13 was one of the few subjects of this study who had had a long duration of progressive prelingual HL which probably had a detrimental influence upon speech perception. All these factors have the potential to manifest themselves in the SRT outcome. As subject 13 had notably worse SRT scores in both ears than the other subjects, subject 13 was determined as an outlier and excluded from the analysis related to correlation between speech scores and cochlear health metrics, but was included in the rest of the analysis (with demographic data). Subjects 2, 9, and 10 reached the lowest (best) SRTs. Only subjects 6, 7, 11, 13, and 16 showed eardifferences larger than 1 dB SNR. Given the high measured SRTs for subject 7L and subject 13 (both ears), at least part of the eardifference in SRT might fall into the test-retest reliability for the matrix sentence test (Hey et al., 2014).\nFor the FMT, scores ranged between 25 and 95%.

Both tests ranked subject 9 and 13 as good and poor performers, respectively. Nevertheless, in case of ear-differences, a comparison of the tests revealed differences in their outcome. A clear difference was apparent for subject 8 who showed the smallest eardifference for SRT and one of the largest differences for FMT. No correlation was observed between the outcome of the tests for ear-differences (Figure 4, right panel).

Black crosses indicate clinically deactivated electrodes.\nAn exemplary case of a successful measurement is subject 16. For subject 16L an acceptable monotonic AGF was obtained for all electrodes and both polarities of the stimulating pulse.\nFrontiers in Integrative Neuroscience 09 frontiersin.org\nSubject 5 is an example for incomplete measurements. For this subject, successful eCAP measurements were obtained for only four electrodes. The calculated IPGEslope values for these electrodes were relatively low across the electrodes, possibly indicating poor cochlear health. A clear variation in IPGEslope along the cochlea was observed in subject 2L with electrode 2 and 9 (examples of higher IPGEslope values) in contrast to electrode 4 and 11 exemplary cases that result in lower IPGEslope values. For some of the subjects such as subject 9 a large difference was observed between the right and left ears in terms of the number of electrodes for which IPGEslope was available. For subject 9L (who had a congenital component to their HL), successful measurements were obtained for all the three conditions for most of the electrodes. For the right ear of this subject, eCAP measurement was not possible.\nFor the three conditions further differences were observed between the ears. For example, for subject 4R, the difference in IPGEslope between conditions was minor. For subject 10R, however, a difference between polarities was apparent in the estimated IPGEslope. In the case of FMA and AP, measurements were successful for most of the electrodes, in contrast to FMC which resulted in successful measurements on only 2 electrodes. A noticeable difference was also observed between FMA and AP for the estimated IPGEslope. Subject 7L and subject 9R were excluded\nfrom all analyses due to the extent of the missing data for these ears. Both subjects had a congenital component to their HL. In cases of analyzing ear-differences, data of subject 7 and 9 was excluded for both ears since calculation of ear-differences was not possible.\nA comparison of IPGEslope measured in this study with the ones measured in a guinea pig model (Figure 7 of Ramekers et al., 2014) showed a smaller magnitude of this cochlear health measure for human subjects. For the 6-week deafened animals in the study of Ramekers et al.

Here too, a weighted Pearson correlation was calculated. No correlation was observed between IPGEslope and SRT when the effect of missing data was not compensated for and when the relative importance of frequency bands was not taken into account (upper panel). For FMC, a weighted Pearson analysis resulted in a weak but significant correlation (middle panel). In general, for both polarities (FMA and FMC) the highest correlation was observed when the effect of missing data was compensated and the relative importance of frequency bands for speech intelligibility was considered (FMA: R2w = 0.25 \u2217, p-val = 0.02, t-val = \u22122.45, df = 18.10, Rw = \u22120.50, FMC: R2w = 0.33 \u2217\u2217, p-val = 0.00, t-val = \u22122.95, df = 17.75, Rw = \u22120.57). For AP,\nFrontiers in Integrative Neuroscience 12 frontiersin.org\nhowever, this observation resulted in a trend but showed no significant correlation (lower panel).\nThe purpose of the weighted correlation was to compensate for missing data. Therefore, a comparison was made between the results of the weighted correlation analysis of all ears and a standard correlation analysis of a subset of ears with relatively complete measurements, which we define as AGF for at least 8 out of 12 electrodes in both polarities and for both IPGs (in total, 9 ears). This standard correlation analysis is shown in Figure 7. A stronger IPGEslope \u2013 SRT correlation was observed for the subset of ears with more successful eCAP measurements in comparison to the result of the weighted correlation analysis of all subjects (Figure 6, lower panel). For the subset of the ears with more successful measurements, the magnitude of the coefficient of determination was comparable between the three conditions (FMA: R2 = 0.55\u2217, p-val = 0.02, t-val = \u22122.92, df = 7, R = \u22120.74, FMC: R2 = 0.50\u2217, p-val = 0.03, t-val = \u22122.66, df = 7, R = \u22120.71, AP: R2 = 0.54\u2217, p-val = 0.02, t-val =\u22122.85, df = 7, R =\u22120.73).\nNo significant correlation was observed between eardifferences of SRT and ear-differences of IPGEslope either for the standard (FMA: R2 = 0.06, FMC: R2 = 0.00, AP: R2 = 0.04) or the weighted (FMA: R2w = 0.06, FMC: R 2 w = 0.00, AP: R 2 w = 0.04) Pearson correlation analyses. Applying the weighting to IPGEslope to account for the relative importance of each frequency band for speech intelligibility did not result in a significant correlation with SRT (FMA: R2w = 0.06, FMC: R 2 w = 0.02, AP: R 2 w = 0.13) when ear-differences were analyzed (data not shown). Figure 8 depicts the FMT scores as a function of the IPGEslope for monaural data and has the same structure as Figure 6. A weak but significant correlation was observed between monaural FMT scores and monaural IPGEslope ASM for FMC, as well as for the standard Pearson correlation analysis and in the absence of applying the weighting to account for the relative importance of each band for speech intelligibility. The magnitude of the coefficient of determination was improved when the weighted Pearson correlation analysis was employed. The highest correlation was observed when, in addition to the weighted correlation, the speech-related weighting was also applied, although the correlation was not significant in case of AP (FMA: R2w = 0.28\n\u2217, p-val = 0.01, t-val = 2,64, df = 18.10, Rw = 0.52, FMC: R2w = 0.25\n\u2217, p-val = 0.02, t-val = 2.46, df = 17.75, Rw = 0.50, AP: R2w = 0.19, p-val = 0.05, t-val = 2.09, df = 18.67, Rw = 0.43). No significant correlation was obtained between IPGEslope ASM and FMT scores either for standard or Pearson correlation or after applying the speech-related weighting when ear-differences were analyzed (FMA: R2w = 0.18, FMC: R2w = 0.01, AP: R 2 w = 0.04, data not shown).\n3.5. IPGEslope and demographic data\nFigure 9 depicts age as a function of IPGEslope for the three artifact reduction methods with monaural data. The correlation analysis showed a clear effect of the polarity of the stimulating pulse: a significant correlation was observed only when a cathodic-leading pulse was used for stimulation. The strength of the correlation (R2 = 0.38, p-val = 0.00, t-val = \u22123.71, df = 22, R = \u22120.62) for the AP condition was intermediate between those obtained with FMA and FMC. No correlations were observed between hearing\naid experience, duration of HL or CI experience and the IPGEslope (data not shown).\nFigure 10 shows the correlation between IPGEslope and age only for the subset of ears with relatively successful eCAP measurement on at least 8 out of the 12 electrodes. This strict inclusion criterion (applied post hoc) strengthened the correlations between the two parameters for all the three artifact reduction approaches. Notably for FMC, a strong and highly significant correlation (R2 = 0.84, p-val = 0.00, t-val = \u22125.98, df = 7, R = \u22120.91) was observed which was considerably higher than the correlations observed in FMA and AP (R2 = 0.60, p-val = 0.01, t-val =\u22123.26, R =\u22120.77) conditions."

The model was also used to investigate whether considering demographic data and classical impedances in addition to cochlear health, in one model, explains the variation in speech intelligibility to a greater extent. The obtained results for the multiple linear analysis were compared to the standard Pearson correlation in a two-dimensional domain as the reference point. The choice of standard instead of weighted Pearson correlation here was to avoid implementation of weighted multiple regression analysis which requires complex calculations. Two-, three-, fourand five-dimensional models were used. If the dimensionality was higher than two, adjusted coefficients of determination (Radj2) were reported to compensate for overfitting, resulting from an increase in dimensionality. The analysis showed that only age was a significant predictor of IPGEslope for FMC and AP conditions. Addition of other investigated demographic factors or electrode impedances did not result in an improvement of model prediction.\nTable 2 describes the variations in SRT as a function of the cochlear health measure alone (first row) and together with CI experience. By considering these two variables, more than 50% of the variation in SRT was explained in the case of FMC. Considering both CI experience and IPGEslope significantly improved the model prediction in comparison with considering only IPGEslope as the independant variable [df(1,19), F-val = 15.61\u2217\u2217\u2217, p-val = 0.00].

They showed a significant correlation between IPGE on level 50% and SGN density in the animal model. No correlation was observed for IPGEslope in the same animal model. They concluded that IPGEslope in either the linear or logarithmic domain is vulnerable to non-neural factors such as electrode-to-modiolus distance or impedances of the stimulating and/or recording electrodes.

The purpose of analyzing the eardifferences was to provide a controlled experimental condition as reported by Schvartz-Leyzac and Pfingst (2018) by factoring out the interindividual variability in cognitive abilities and other aspects related to processing of the central auditory system in CI users. Furthermore, the influences of stimulus polarity, artifact reduction technique, demographic data and the impact of the application of a weighting function related to the speech band importance function on a measure of cochlear health were all investigated.\n4.1. Correlation between IPGEslope and speech intelligibility and the effect of weighting\nFor both monaural data and ear-differences, insignificant or very weak correlations were observed between absolute values\nof IPGEslope and speech test outcomes when a standard Pearson correlation was applied, regardless of stimulus polarity. One factor limiting the potential applicability of a correlation analysis was missing data due to unsuccessful eCAP measurements on several electrodes. The extent of missing data was heterogeneous across ears and for both polarities. A weighted Pearson correlation analysis was employed to compensate for the influence of missing data. This resulted in a weak but significant correlation between monaural IPGEslope and speech test outcomes for some of the conditions as shown in the middle row of Figures 6, 8.\nAnother factor influencing the relationship between IPGEslope and speech test outcome was the relative importance of each frequency band for speech intelligibility. The importance of speech information is not uniform across the spectrum, but is frequency dependent. Consequently as a result of cochlear tonotopy, degeneration of spiral ganglion cells along Rosenthal\u2019s Canal does not equally impair CI speech outcomes. It is essential to account for this relative importance when relating cochlear health measures to speech intelligibility. This was implemented in this paper by applying the weighting function depicted in Figure 2 to AGF slopes. Employment of this weighting function together with the weighted correlation analysis resulted in an improved significant correlation between IPGEslope and speech test outcomes for monaural data and in FMA and FMC conditions. A comparison of the upper rows of Figures 6, 8 with the lower rows reveals the effect of compensation for these two factors. No correlation was observed for ear-differences in any condition.\nThese findings are in line with those of Imsiecke et al. (2021), who found no correlation between IPGEslope and speech intelligibility in CI listeners with residual hearing for the case where the effect of missing data and relative importance of speech information were not considered. In contrast, Schvartz-Leyzac and Pfingst (2018) observed a strong correlation between eardifferences of IPGEslope and SRT. The observed difference might partly be due to differences in calculation of IPGEslope ASM. In this study, first changes in AGF slopes in response to changes in IPG were calculated for each electrode and subsequently the mean of slope changes for all the electrodes was calculated. In SchvartzLeyzac and Pfingst (2018), the difference of the means of AGF slopes for single IPGs was reported (most probably to overcome\nFrontiers in Integrative Neuroscience 14 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 8 Freiburg monosyllable (FMT) scores as a function of IPGEslope ASM for monaural data.

The two approaches would have been identical in the absence of missing data. In both studies, for some of the electrodes no AGF was obtained at least for one of the IPGs resulting in a difference when changing the order of averaging and subtraction.\nAnother potential reason behind the contradictory conclusions of the two studies might be the differences in speech understanding scores of the subjects in each study. The ear-differences in SRT for several participants of the study of Schvartz-Leyzac and Pfingst (2018) ranged from a few dB to 10 dB SNR. Whereas in this study, ear-differences higher than 1 dB SNR were measured only for four subjects. Two of these four subjects, subject 7, and subject 13, who showed the largest ear-differences were excluded from IPGEslopeSRT correlation analysis. The reason behind the exclusion of subject 13 was identification as outlier in terms of speech intelligibility. In case of subject 7, the eCAP measurement of the worse ear was interrupted by the subject, leading to incomplete data. These two subjects were also the only ones who had (mild) auditory dyslalia which is an indication of irregular speech development, possibly leading to a relatively large effect of cognitive processing on performance (Lang-Roth, 2014).

Consideration of sequential delays between implantation dates on both sides also played a role for subject inclusion. Subjects who received their second implant shortly after the first implantation were prioritized (except for subject 9). A comparison of the ear-differences in CI experience showed a tendency toward larger differences for the study of Schvartz-Leyzac and Pfingst (2018). Differences in speech testing materials used may also contribute to the difference in speech-test outcomes. The tests might not be equal in their semantic content and consequently in engagement of cognition. In terms of SRT measurement, two methodological differences were observed between the two studies. First, Schvartz-Leyzac and Pfingst (2018) employed a step-size of 2 dB to obtain the adaptive track. However, in this study an adaptive step-size was used which was varied depending on the subject\u2019s response and might have enabled a more accurate estimation of the speech reception threshold. Second, Schvartz-Leyzac and Pfingst (2018) kept the level of the mixed signal (speech + noise) constant. In present study, the level of noise was kept constant and the level of speech was varied to obtain the desired SNR. Additionally, differences in electrode array types, test language, and inclusion of two subjects with the history of explantation/reimplantation by Schvartz-Leyzac and Pfingst (2018) may contribute to the differences in the outcome of the two studies. Standard Pearson correlation analysis of the ears with the most successful eCAP measurements showed mild but significant correlations between IPGEslope and SRTs. This result supported the validity of weighted correlation as a method to partly compensate for the effect of missing data. It also supported the assumption that IPGEslope would be more suitable for assessing cochlear health if complete eCAP measurement sets were available. The strength of correlation was roughly similar for the three conditions. Based on this result, it could be concluded that, in case of high quality eCAP measurement, polarity might not be influential in correlating cochlear health to speech intelligibility in quiet or in stationary noise. However, an analysis with the same subset of subjects relating age to IPGEslope did exhibit differences between the three conditions (Figure 10). Significant correlations were observed between SRT and FMT scores for monaural listening but not for ear-differences of the two measures. The same pattern was obtained for the analysis of IPGEslope and SRTs. The large number of subjects in this cohort with progressive HL as the etiology may suggest a high number of genetic causes, which can be more likely to be symmetric. These findings give rise to doubts about the general applicability of an analysis of ear-differences of speech test results. While it appears feasible in certain groups of listeners with relatively large ear-differences in SRT, such as those reported by Schvartz-Leyzac and Pfingst (2018), transferring the approach of\nFrontiers in Integrative Neuroscience 16 frontiersin.org\nanalysis of ear-differences to a random selection of bilateral CI users might not always yield a useful result.\n4.2. Correlation between IPGEoffset and speech intelligibility\nBrochier et al. (2021) compared different methods used for interpretation of changes in eCAP AGF due to changes in IPG using both computational and animal models. They showed a significant correlation between IPGE on level 50% and SGN density in the animal model. No correlation was observed for IPGEslope\nin the same animal model. They concluded that IPGEslope in either the linear or logarithmic domain is vulnerable to non-neural factors such as electrode-to-modiolus distance or impedances of the stimulating and/or recording electrodes. As a solution, for human subjects, the authors proposed the IPGEoffset which was defined as average offset (in dB re 1 nC) in stimulus amplitude between the linearly growing portions of the eCAP AGFs (obtained with short and long IPGs) expressed on logarithmic input-output axis [Figure 9 in Brochier et al. (2021)].\nOne potential reason behind the observed difference in the outcome of this study and findings of Brochier et al. (2021) might be due to differences in assessment approaches. Unlike with computational and animal models, the accurate estimation\nFrontiers in Integrative Neuroscience 17 frontiersin.org\nof level 50% is difficult in most of the human subjects. When the AGF is sampled at only 12 current levels, as was done in the present study, a robust estimation of level 50% requires the AGF to reach the inflection point. This was rarely observable in our data and is generally difficult to measure post-operatively with stimulation levels below the loudest applicable presentation level. As a substitution to level 50%, the method based on averaging of current offset for different voltage levels (and not only level 50%) was implemented as suggested by Brochier et al. (2021). This change in the approach for estimation of IPGEoffset might at least partly explain the difference in the outcome of these two studies. The results obtained in this study are in line with the findings of Kim et al. (2010) who employed a very similar approach for the calculation of IPGEoffset and reported no significant correlation between this measure and the speech performance in human subjects."

            "text": "Many studies have investigated the proper unit for analysis of psychophysical and physiological measurements in CI users. McKay (2012) investigated the psychometric probe threshold measured using a forward masking paradigm. The author argued that the ratio or logarithmic units are the best for estimation of probe thresholds because only in these domains are the effects of electrode-neuron distances canceled out, and only the effective change that neurons experience remains. For example, increasing the stimulation current from 100 to 200 \u00b5A might result in an increase of 0.5\u20131 \u00b5A in one case and from 1 to 2 \u00b5A in other case. In both cases the effective current received by neurons was doubled as a response to doubling the stimulation current, but there is a difference in the raw increment. The author argued that the ratio and logarithmic domain can reflect this effect but not the linear domain.\nBrochier et al. (2021) used the same argumentation for the calculation of IPGEoffset and applied the IPGEoffset in the logarithmic domain as a cochlear health measure robust against non-neural factors such as variation in electrode-neuron interfaces or variation in the stimulating current level. It should be noted that as IPGEoffset is a differential measure, a logarithmic transformation not only compensates for different field gradient strengths, i.e., effect current at the recruited population, but also removes any time related effects. Degeneration affects the degree of the temporal integration of neurons. Therefore, a reliable estimation of cochlear health requires a measure which should be sensitive to changes in temporal integration. This argumentation was confirmed with the outcome of this study which showed a significant correlation between IPGEslope in the linear domain and speech test outcome but no significant correlation for IPGEoffset in the logarithmic domain. The observation that the IPGE in the linear domain showed only a significant effect could therefore be explained by differences in how the neural population could integrate over time, and that this information is removed by an analysis in the logarithmic domain.\nThe findings of this study are in line with the study of Takanen et al. (2022) who modeled three cochlear health measures, (1) IPGEslope in the linear domain, (2) relative IPGEslope (ratio\nof slopes), and (3) IPGEoffset in the logarithmic domain. They investigated the effect of electrode-neuron interfaces and cochlear health (defined as the number of surviving SGN). They reported that only IPGEslope in linear domain was sensitive to cochlear health, although it was also affected by variation in electrodeneuron distance. Relative IPGEslope and IPGEoffset in logarithmic domain were not sensitive to either factor."

            "text": "Cochlear implant research has already shed light on the relationship between some of the cochlear health measures and demographic data. A correlation between the duration of HL and AGF slope was reported by Schvartz-Leyzac and Pfingst (2016). IPGE on threshold and level 50% were also correlated to duration of HL in the study of Imsiecke et al. (2021). In the present study, a strong correlation was observed between age and IPGEslope for FMC but not for FMA (Figures 9, 10). This may highlight a higher diagnostic power of cathodic-leading pulses for a particular aspect of cochlear health. The physiological decrease in human SGN populations (Zimmermann et al., 1995; Otte et al., 2015) with age suggests that a measure sensitive to degenerative processes such as demyelination and loss of SGN PPs as well as subsequent SGN death would therefore exhibit a negative correlation with age. Modeling studies (Rattay, 1999; Rattay et al., 2001a,b; Resnick et al., 2018) elaborated on why cathodic leading pulses are less effective than anodic pulses in eliciting spikes in the region beyond the cell body of SGNs with degenerated PPs. PPs of SGNs degenerate as a consequence of sensorineural deafness (Glueckert et al., 2005) or age-related HL (Kumar et al., 2022) following decreased neurotrophic support from the organ of Corti and from supporting cells (Zilberstein et al., 2012). One finding of this study is that cathodic-leading stimuli are better suited as an electrophysiological marker for SGN degeneration than anodic-leading stimuli. Degenerated PPs should consequently be assessed more reliably with FMC. Observation of a strong negative correlation between age and IPGEslope for FMC but not for FMA in this study (Figure 9) suggests that cathodicleading pulses may in fact be more sensitive for assessment of degeneration of peripheral process and thereby of cochlear health. Previous studies (Jahn and Arenberg, 2019a,b) investigated the relationship between the polarity effect on behavioral thresholds using triphasic stimuli without interphase gap found evidence for increasing cathodic thresholds with increasing age, which are in agreement with the findings of the present study. However, previous electrophysiological investigations have been conducted with similar hypotheses regarding the polarity effect and cochlear health, but generated less conclusive results (Hughes et al., 2017, 2018). The relatively small sample size in such studies is always a statistical obstacle when attempting to generalize and compare results. However, the current investigation differs from the previous studies in various factors, such as the focus on cathodic-leading stimuli (in contrast to anodic minus cathodic, polarity effect), investigation of individual subjects (in contrast to averaging across all or groups of subjects), correlating with age in years, and investigating the IPGE between 30 and 2.1 \u00b5s for different polarities\nFrontiers in Integrative Neuroscience 18 frontiersin.org\n(in contrast to comparisons between polarity effect on eCAP threshold, AGF slope or on MCL). One or several of these factors, as well as a different subject selection may be used to argue for the more conclusive results in this study.\nTaken together, our findings provide evidence for the initial hypothesis, that IPGEslope may be used as an electrophysiological biomarker for cochlear health when measured with cathodicleading stimuli. Partial degeneration and / or complete loss of SGNs may both play an important role and this differentiation requires further research. Demyelination of the peripheral process will increase membrane capacitance (Rattay et al., 2001b) and along with possible downregulation of ion channel expression (Pan et al., 2016, 2021), the response times of SGNs to extracellular stimulation will increase. Further models investigating demyelination suggested that response thresholds may be largely unaffected, but response timing may change significantly (Resnick et al., 2018). The vulnerable period in which the second phase can still prevent depolarization caused by the first phase to pass threshold (van den Honert and Mortimer, 1979) has been suggested to range between 8.7 and 16 \u00b5s (Rubinstein et al., 2001) but may likely extend during years of deafness such that a 30 \u00b5s IPG is no longer sufficient to allow spike initiation in neurons close to threshold and at the borders of the excited SGN population. Setting the shorter IPG to 2.1 \u00b5s was suited to have samples of the second phase interrupting the vulnerable period, longer IPGs may not be suited for the choice as the shorter IPG. The etiology of HL was progressive in 10 of 13 subjects (77%) in this study, suggesting ongoing degenerative processes as well as the presence of remaining hair cells and PPs. Further research is required for more detailed investigation of the principles underlying preferential polarity sensitivity in CI users."

            "text": "Although a significant correlation was observed between cochlear health and speech measures, variations in speech perception among CI users are still large. In order to explain the interindividual variability in speech perception of CI users, more than one factor needs to be taken into account. To realize this goal in the present study, a multiple linear regression model was employed and the variation in speech intelligibility was partly explained. IPGEslope was used as the main independent variable. Integration of CI experience in the model in addition to IPGEslope resulted in the greatest performance of the model. This is most probably because IPGEslope was correlated to age and inclusion of age therefore did not provide complementary information to the model. For the case of FMA, the observed correlation was most likely due to CI experience.\nIt is important to consider the effect of overfitting with high dimensional models, particularly in cases of a smaller sample size as in the one employed here. Adjusted R2 values were reported to compensate for the effect of overfitting. Nevertheless, caution should be taken in interpreting the outcome of these models in particular with respect to the data size of 24 ears. Therefore, it is suggested to repeat this analysis with a larger dataset and (if possible) with less missing data. For the multiple regression analysis, it was not possible to include only the ears with relatively\ncomplete eCAP measurements. However, based on the higher correlation observed in case of considering only ears with successful measurements on at least 8 electrodes, it can be concluded that employing such a model with a dataset with less missing data might result in an increase in the predictive performance of the model.\nWalia et al. (2022) also employed multiple regression models to predict the speech intelligibility of CI users in noise, however, considering different factors to the ones employed in this study. They explained up to 60% of the variation in speech intelligibility by considering electrocochleography (EcochG) and cognition. Complementary to their study that used EcochG as the cochlear health measure, this study employed IPGEslope. EcochG has the advantage of being measurable in CI candidates prior to implantation and therefore can be used in the process of decision making for implantation. However, since it is not channel specific, it has limited applications to post-implantation. Whereas eCAP based cochlear health measures, as used in this study, have the potential to determine the cochlear health locally, post-implantation and to be employed for individualized fitting. Walia et al. (2022) reported coefficient of determination (R2) and not the adjusted coefficient of determination (R2adj), which might have an increased contribution from overfitting.\nFor future studies additional factors such as deficits in the fitting of CI processors or issues related to rehabilitation measures may be of interest."

The study design controlled for many of the covarying factors affecting speech intelligibility. The variability in electrode array type was kept as low as possible. However, to completely factor out the interindividual variability in reconstruction of cochlear tonotopy, the information about the length of electrode array should be assessed together with the respective insertion angle and cochlear size. To avoid such a bias, this information should be considered in future.\nIn an attempt to control for the cognitive ability of the subjects, ear-differences in cochlear health measures and speech intelligibility were employed. However, analysis of the eardifferences revealed limitations to this approach. These limitations include the difficulty in recruiting a large enough number of subjects with between-ear SRT differences higher than 1 dB SNR, and the difficulty of obtaining complete eCAP measurements for both ears in some subjects. Therefore, the analysis of monaural data was preferred in the present study. However, this approach came at the expense of losing control over the cognitive ability (which is a highly individual variable and demonstrated in many studies to be related to performance). Therefore, it might be useful for future studies to assess the cognitive ability of the subjects via additional testing in order to describe some of the remaining unexplained variation in speech intelligibility of the CI users.\nOne other uncontrolled factor influencing speech intelligibility is the spread of excitation. Patterns of spread of excitation vary among the CI users and are affected by features of electrode\nFrontiers in Integrative Neuroscience 19 frontiersin.org\npositioning such as distance from the lateral wall, by the electrode impedances, and by the parameters of the stimulating pulse e.g., pulse amplitude. A large spread of excitation results in interaction between neighboring channels and consequently deteriorates the speech cues. Reliable transmission of speech cues requires focused excitation as well as functioning SGNs. Transmission of deteriorated speech cues by functioning SGNs may result in degraded speech intelligibility. Therefore, to assess the influence of cochlear health on speech intelligibility it is important to control for the spread of excitation. However, it might be difficult to find a measure of the spread of excitation that controls for the survival of SGNs (He et al., 2017). Garcia et al. (2021) took an initial step in disentangling the effect of these two inter-related factors and introduced an approach for estimation of spread of excitation while using neural health vectors to control for SGN survival. Measures based on imaging techniques might also be helpful in bypassing these confounding effect (Noble et al., 2013). Considering the variation in the spread of excitation might help to better explain the outcome of this study.\nElectrode impedances also might be indicative of the influence of non-neural factors on cochlear health measures. Impedance measures are regularly assessed in clinical visits and could be used to modify an index of cochlear health without additional effort by the clinician. In animal models, impedance measures have been shown to correlate with intrascalar fibrosis (Ramekers et al., 2021) and with ossification (Colesa et al., 2022), while a distinct relationship between impedance and CI speech outcomes cannot be shown (Prenzler et al., 2020). In future, the relationship between electrode impedances and cochlear health should be investigated to assess the impact of electrode impedances on cochlear health measures.\nIn addition to objective measures of cochlear health, a subjective measure called charge integration efficiency has been introduced by Zhou et al. (2020). Loudness grows more slowly with an increase in pulse phase duration in comparison with pulse amplitude (for the same delivered charge). The dB difference between pulse amplitude and pulse phase duration dynamic range, i.e., the established chronaxie measure, may be used to estimate the extent of neural degeneration. Zhou et al. (2020) correlated the charge integration efficacy with duration of HL, an indirect measure of cochlear health, as well as with speech recognition (Zhou et al., 2021). In comparison with IPGEslope, charge integration efficacy might be a faster measure of cochlear health as it can be measured psychophysically in a co-operative subject. Nevertheless, its subjective nature might restrict its possible application e.g., for pediatric cases. Further studies are required to compare IPGEslope and charge integration efficacy in terms of their accuracy as well as their vulnerability to missing data.\nTo calculate the relative importance of each band for speech intelligibility, the band importance function introduced in ANSI S3.5 (1997) was adapted to the MED-EL default filter bank setting. In general, the estimation of speech band importance function could be affected by several factors such as the characteristics of the frequency bands (center frequency and bandwidth, compare Supplementary Table 1 to Supplementary Table 2 for ANSI S3.5-1997) or the language (Jin et al., 2016). Also, natural acoustic speech is different in terms of content from the CIcoded speech (Bosen and Chatterjee, 2016). This latter factor is still an active research topic for CI studies. Even for a certain\nlanguage, variation in speech material results in differences in the estimated band importance function (CID-22 v.s., NU6, Supplementary Table 2, ANSI S3.5-1997). For any application of band importance function, it is desirable to consider as many of these factors as possible to obtain a function which is tailored to that particular application. It is hypothesized that a tailored band importance function together with complete electrophysiological measurement results in a more accurate prediction of speech intelligibility.\nThe clinical map of some of the subjects might be different than the default map. Various factors determine the suitable fitting map for individual users in terms of the filter bank setting. The presence of low frequency hearing usually results in a change in the filter bank setting because in such a case the listeners are able to hear the low frequencies acoustically and the CI codes a restricted frequency bandwidth. Another influential factor might be the usage of the anatomy-based fitting which aims at preserving the natural frequency-place map. Here, the amount of the change depends on the insertion depth and the position of the electrodes in the cochlea. Electrode deactivation also affect the filter bank setting and consequently the band importance function. Facial nerve stimulation, open or short circuitry are exemplary common reasons for electrode deactivation which results in the frequency redistribution among the remaining electrodes and depends on the number of deactivated electrodes. The extent of the variation from the default map is individual and ranges from a slight change to a moderate one. Employment of band importance functions adapted to individual maps of the CI users is worthwhile to be tested in future."

            "text": "This study investigated the applicability of cochlear health measures for prediction of speech perception capabilities in CI users. We focused particularly on investigating the effect of the polarity of the stimulating pulse and the utility of the band importance function. In conclusion, significant correlations were observed between IPGEslope and speech perception outcomes, with equal correlation strength for anodic-leading and cathodic-leading pulses, but not for the ear-differences. We found that reliable relationships between the investigated parameters of cochlear health could only be established when the relative importance of each frequency band for speech intelligibility was taken into account. A significant negative correlation was observed between IPGEslope and age. In this case, cathodic-leading pulses resulted in a significant and strong correlation, while anodic-leading pulse showed no significant correlation, supporting the hypothesis that cathodic-leading pulses are better suited for detection of degenerated SGN PPs. The higher sensitivity of younger CI users to cathodic-leading may be due to a larger number of excitable PPs in regions closer to the electrode contact where a cathodic stimulus leads to depolarization more effectively. Missing data was particularly detrimental to the analysis. The highest correlations were observed when the effect of missing data was compensated either by implementation of a weighted correlation or when\nFrontiers in Integrative Neuroscience 20 frontiersin.org\nonly ears with relatively complete measurements were included into the analysis. For an accurate estimation of cochlear health (neural status), measurements of high quality eCAPs were essential. Stimulation with a cathodic-leading phase might help to improve the estimation of cochlear health. The results of this study together with further information about current spread, which is assumed to be an individual factor and degrades the spectral resolution of the coded speech, have the potential to explain the observed variation in performance achieved by CI users, partly due to variation in the degeneration level of the auditory periphery."
