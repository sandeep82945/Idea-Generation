    "abstractText": "87 Introduction: Current stroke guidelines do not give uniform recommendations regarding the use of 88 CT perfusion (CTP) for the selection of patients presenting within six hours after symptom onset for 89 endovascular treatment (EVT). Model-based analyses can be used to estimate the potential long90 term costs and health effects of CTP for patient selection. 91 Methods: In this nationwide retrospective cohort study with model-based health economic 92 evaluation, 703 large vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke patients with CTP imaging and EVT 93 within six hours after symptom were included (Inclusion: January 2018\u2013March 2022; 94 trialsearch.who.int:NL7974). CTP-based EVT patient selection using varying ischemic core volumes 95 (ICV) and core-penumbra mismatch ratios (MMR) was compared with providing EVT to all patients. 96 Net monetary benefit (NMB) at a willingness to pay of \u20ac80,000 per quality-adjusted life year, the 97 incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), the difference in costs (\u0394Costs), and quality-adjusted life 98 years (\u0394QALY) per 1000 patients were the outcome measures. 99 Results: The cohort of patients with CTP and EVT used for simulations consisted of 391/703 males 100 with a median age of 72 (IQR:62;81). Considering the most optimal ICV (\u2265110mL) and MMR (\u22641.4) 101 thresholds, CTP-based selection for EVT resulted in a loss of health (\u0394QALYs: ICV-median:-3.3[IQR:102 5.9;-1.1], MMR median:0.0 [IQR:-1.3;0.0]), limited additional costs or cost savings (\u0394Costs: ICV103 median:-\u20ac348,966[IQR:-\u20ac712,406;-\u20ac51,158], MMR-median:\u20ac266,336[IQR:\u20ac229,403;\u20ac380,095]), and 104 an ICER and NMB with a wide IQR (ICER ICV-median:71,346[IQR:-16,517;181,241], MMR105 median:312,955[IQR:-141,379;infinite]) (NMB ICV-median:\u20ac102,227[IQR:-\u20ac282,942;\u20ac431,923], 106 MMR-median:-\u20ac278,850[IQR:-\u20ac457,097:-\u20ac229,403]). 107 Conclusion: In EVT-eligible patients presenting within six hours after symptom onset, excluding 108 patients based on CTP parameters was not cost-effective and could potentially harm patients. 109 110 All rights reserved.

However, it remains largely 67 unclear what the associated costs and health implications are in the long run of CT perfusion (CTP) 68 based patient selection for EVT in patients presenting within six hours after symptom onset. 69\nWhat this study adds: At optimized ischemic core volume (ICV) and core-penumbra mismatch ratio 70 (MMR) thresholds, CTP-based selection for EVT resulted in a loss of health (\u0394QALYs: ICV\u2265110mL 71 median:-3.3[IQR:-5.9;-1.1], MMR\u22641.4 median:0.0 [IQR:-1.3;0.0]) for similar costs (\u0394Costs: ICV\u2265110mL 72 median:-\u20ac348,966[IQR:-\u20ac712,406;-\u20ac51,158], MMR\u22641.4 median:\u20ac266,336[IQR:\u20ac229,403;\u20ac380,095]) 73 per 1,000 patients. 74\nHow this study might affect research, practice or policy: Selecting patients using CTP will likely 75 result in a loss of health and at best a minor cost saving. Even in scenario\u2019s considering unfeasibly 76 low EVT benefit and in patients aged\u226580 years CTP based patient selection for EVT was not cost-77 effective. 78\n79\n80\n81\n82\n83\n84\n85\n86\nAbstract 87\nIntroduction: Current stroke guidelines do not give uniform recommendations regarding the use of 88 CT perfusion (CTP) for the selection of patients presenting within six hours after symptom onset for 89 endovascular treatment (EVT). Model-based analyses can be used to estimate the potential long-90 term costs and health effects of CTP for patient selection. 91\nMethods: In this nationwide retrospective cohort study with model-based health economic 92 evaluation, 703 large vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke patients with CTP imaging and EVT 93 within six hours after symptom were included (Inclusion: January 2018\u2013March 2022; 94 trialsearch.who.int:NL7974). CTP-based EVT patient selection using varying ischemic core volumes 95 (ICV) and core-penumbra mismatch ratios (MMR) was compared with providing EVT to all patients. 96 Net monetary benefit (NMB) at a willingness to pay of \u20ac80,000 per quality-adjusted life year, the 97 incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), the difference in costs (\u0394Costs), and quality-adjusted life 98 years (\u0394QALY) per 1000 patients were the outcome measures. 99\nResults: The cohort of patients with CTP and EVT used for simulations consisted of 391/703 males 100 with a median age of 72 (IQR:62;81). Considering the most optimal ICV (\u2265110mL) and MMR (\u22641.4) 101 thresholds, CTP-based selection for EVT resulted in a loss of health (\u0394QALYs: ICV-median:-3.3[IQR:-102 5.9;-1.1], MMR median:0.0 [IQR:-1.3;0.0]), limited additional costs or cost savings (\u0394Costs: ICV-103 median:-\u20ac348,966[IQR:-\u20ac712,406;-\u20ac51,158], MMR-median:\u20ac266,336[IQR:\u20ac229,403;\u20ac380,095]), and 104 an ICER and NMB with a wide IQR (ICER ICV-median:71,346[IQR:-16,517;181,241], MMR-105 median:312,955[IQR:-141,379;infinite]) (NMB ICV-median:\u20ac102,227[IQR:-\u20ac282,942;\u20ac431,923], 106 MMR-median:-\u20ac278,850[IQR:-\u20ac457,097:-\u20ac229,403]). 107\nConclusion: In EVT-eligible patients presenting within six hours after symptom onset, excluding 108 patients based on CTP parameters was not cost-effective and could potentially harm patients. 109\n110\nIntroduction 111\nAcute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with a large infarct region due to a large vessel occlusion (LVO) 112 had a better outcome after endovascular treatment (EVT) compared to best medical management in 113 three recent randomized clinical trials (RCTs).1\u20133 This is in contrast to earlier studies where no 114 statistically significant benefit of EVT was found in patients with a large infarct who present within 115 six hours after symptom onset.4 Furthermore, the benefit of EVT was higher in RCTs that used CTP 116 measures such as ischemic core volume (ICV) and core-penumbra mismatch ratio (MMR) as an 117 inclusion criteria.4 Additionally, the benefit of EVT declines depending on ICV in patients aged \u226575 118 years.5 Since recent large stroke trials had restrictive inclusion criteria, varying imaging protocols, 119 and only evaluated patient outcome at 90 days follow-up,1\u20133 it remains partially unclear what the 120 long-term costs and health effects are of selecting patients for EVT based on CTP measures. Health 121 economic model-based analyses could be used to estimate long-term costs and health effects for 122 various scenarios and uses of CTP for EVT patient selection. 123\nThree previous model-based studies had conflicting results regarding the cost-effectiveness of CTP 124 for patients presenting within six hours.6\u20138 These three studies were based on fixed assumptions for 125 the EVT effect, EVT effect modification due to CTP measures, and fixed decision threshold based on 126 CTP measures. As a result, these studies do not consider population variations and uncertainty in 127 current evidence.9,10 Namely, the EVT effect could be lower in patients with a large infarct or in 128 elderly subgroups.5 In addition, the optimal ICV or MMR thresholds for EVT selection remain a 129 matter of debate. Furthermore, due to improvements in CTP acquisition and analytical software, 130 previous evidence for ICV and MMR-based EVT effect modification and associations with functional 131 outcome might be inaccurate.11 Finally, costs and health effect estimates from previous studies were 132 adapted from a US perspective which might not apply to European and other healthcare systems.6\u20138 133\nWe aimed to quantify the long-term costs and health effects of CTP-estimated ICV and MMR to 134 select patients within six hours after stroke onset for EVT in the Netherlands compared to providing 135\nEVT to all patients. Furthermore, we aimed to identify scenarios where CTP-based patient selection 136 for EVT might be cost-effective. 137\nMethods 138\nStudy design 139\nThe Cost-effectiveness of CT perfusion for patients with acute ischemic stroke (CLEOPATRA) is a 140 Dutch nationwide, retrospective, multicenter health economic modeling study using patient-level 141 data and literature parameters.12 A cohort of patients with an LVO that received EVT after CTP 142 imaging with 90-day functional outcome according to the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) was 143 considered. During inclusion, the standard of care was to provide EVT to all patients regardless of 144 the CTP measures.13 We compared CTP-based patient selection for EVT (\u201cCTP select EVT\u201d arm) with 145 providing EVT to all patients (\u201call EVT\u201d arm). The decision to offer or withhold EVT in the CTP arm 146 was dependent on an ICV or MMR threshold per patient. Since we used observational data of 147 patients who underwent EVT, available ORs for treatment effect, 9,14 and treatment effect 148 modification due to CTP measures10 were used to generate the 90-day mRS as if those patients did 149 not undergo EVT (referred to as the \u2018no EVT group\u2019). We assumed that EVT could directly follow after 150 imaging and that CTP would not delay time to EVT. The methodology for the no EVT group 151 generation is described in Online Supplement A. 152\nData collection 153\nPatients who had CTP before EVT in an EVT-capable stroke center for an anterior circulation LVO 154 between January 2018 and March 2022 were included from the following data sources: the 155 Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke in The 156 Netherlands (MR CLEAN)-NO IV (ISRCTN80619088),15 MR CLEAN-MED (ISRCTN76741621),16 the MR 157 CLEAN Registry,17 and a local cohort of patients from our comprehensive stroke center (Amsterdam 158 UMC location University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). A detailed overview of the 159\nstudy-specific inclusion and exclusion criteria were previously published together with predefined 160 modeling procedures and study endpoints.12 Online Supplement B describes minor changes to the 161 protocol.12 CTP acquisition, post-processing, and quality assessment are presented in Online 162 Supplement C. 12 For patients included in the MR CLEAN-MED and MR CLEAN-NO IV trials, deferred 163 consent was received, for patients included in the MR CLEAN Registry and the retrospective local 164 cohort a waiver for informed consent was provided by the institutional review board. Data is 165 available upon reasonable request and following local privacy regulations. 166\nModeling approach 167\nA Markov model with patient-level micro-simulations was used to simulate 5- and 10-year follow-up. 168 The model consisted of a short-term 90-day post-AIS model to simulate EVT patient selection 169 strategies followed by a long-term yearly model (Figure 1) and was used to simulate functional 170 outcome measured with the mRS. In the long-term model, deterioration of mRS was simulated 171 based on the probability of stroke recurrence18 and death19 inflated with patient-specific Hazard 172 Ratios (HR).20 Simulations and analyses were performed with publicly available custom-developed 173 Python software (github.com/anonymous/CLEOPATRA). All model input parameters are described in 174 Online Supplement D. 175\n176\n177\nfor EVT was based on varying thresholds for ischemic core volume and core-penumbra mismatch ratio. In the 182 conventional arm, all patients underwent EVT. B) after EVT or no EVT the 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 183 was modelled based on observed mRS (EVT group) or adjusted mRS with ORs (no EVT group). C) After the 90-184 day outcome, yearly mRS transitions were modelled based on death and recurrent stroke rates. *: The proportion 185 of patients that do not receive EVT differs based on the set ischemic core volume or core-penumbra mismatch 186 ratio thresholds. 187 188\nCosts and QALYs 189\nCosts in euros (\u20ac) from a healthcare payer perspective and QALYs over the simulated period were 190 derived per mRS sub-score in a previous study21 and predefined in our protocol.12 Online 191 supplement D describes the acute care and long-term follow-up costs. Acute care costs included 192 personnel cost, radiological imaging, EVT procedure, and thrombolysis costs. Long-term follow-up 193 costs considered In-hospital care use, outpatient clinic visits, rehabilitation, formal homecare, and 194 long-term institutionalized care. Present values of simulated costs and QALYs were calculated based 195 on a discounting rate of 4% for QALYs and 1.5 % for costs yearly.22 Historical and forecasted inflation 196 rates for healthcare costs were used to adjust the costs over time.23,24 197\nOutcome measures 198\nThe primary outcome was the net monetary benefit (NMB: Formula 1) at a willingness to pay (WTP) 199 of \u20ac80,000 per QALY of CTP-based EVT patient selection (CTP) compared with the conventional 200 imaging arm (no CTP). Secondary outcome measures were the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 201 (ICER: Formula 2), and differences in cost (\u0394Costs) and quality-adjusted life-years (\u0394QALYs) between 202 the simulated CTP and no CTP arms. 203\n\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc35 = \ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc43 \u2217 (\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc47 \u2212 \ud835\udc44\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59 \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc47) \u2212 (\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc47 \u2212 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59 \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc47) 204\nFormula 1 205\n\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc45 = (\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc47 \u2212 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59 \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc47)\n(\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc47 \u2212 \ud835\udc44\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc4c\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59 \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc47) 206\nFormula 2 207\nBaseline and sensitivity analyses 208\nMean values of the model inputs were used for the baseline simulation including all patients once. 209 Baseline simulation EVT patient exclusion thresholds were \u226570mL for ICV and \u22641.8 for MMR. In the 210 one-way sensitivity analyses, the effect on outcomes of a 10% increase or decrease of input 211 parameters relative to the baseline simulation was simulated. In the probabilistic sensitivity analyses 212 (PSAs), 1,000 cohorts of 703 patients were sampled with replacement from the original data. Each 213 cohort contains a proportion of patients that did not receive EVT in the CTP arm since they had an 214 ICV above or MMR below the decision threshold. ICV and MMR values were varied with increments 215 of 10 between 0 and 150 mL and increments of 0.2 between 1.4 and 2.4, The decision threshold with 216 the highest median NMB across all cohorts was chosen as the optimal setting. Per simulated cohort, 217 the \u0394Costs and \u0394QALYs between the CTP and no CTP arms were computed. All PSA results were 218 reported as the median with interquartile range (IQR) over the 1,000 simulated cohort per 1,000 219 patients. 220\nA baseline PSA was conducted using an OR for the EVT effect from the MR CLEAN trial 221 (OR:1.67[95%CI:1.21-2.30]).14 We performed dedicated PSAs altering the OR and 95%CI for EVT 222 effect with -0.5, -0.3, +0.3, and +0.82. The lower bound (-0.5) corresponds to the EVT effect in 223 patients with a large infarct in NCCT (Alberta Stroke Program Early CT [ASPECTS] score\u22645) and the 224 upper bound (+0.82) refers to the pooled EVT effect in the HERMES meta-analysis.9 The regression 225 analyses for EVT effect modification due to CTP estimated ICV and MMR by Campbell et al. were 226 repeated as the initial work only reported p-values (full analyses in Online supplement D).10 An OR 227 for EVT effect modification due to ICV (OR:0.98 [95%CI:0.881-1.091] per 10 mL) and MMR 228 (OR:1.010[95%CI:0.994;1.026]) per one point change) were used for baseline simulations. Since 229 these ORs were based on CTPs from trials published between 2015 and 2017 with limited brain 230 coverage,10,25 the ORs and 95%CIs for effect modification were altered by -0.1 and -0.05 for ICV, and 231 +0.1 and +0.05 for MMR to consider technological improvements in CTP software. Finally, we 232\nsimulated the most favorable CTP-based EVT patient selection PSA scenario considering patients 233 aged \u226580 years, a 0.3 decrease of the EVT effect OR (OR:1.37[95%CI:0.91-2.0]), and a 0.1 decrease of 234 the ICV or MMR based EVT effect modification (OR:0.88[95%CI:0.781-0.991]). 235\nResults 236\nDescriptive statistics 237\nA total of 703/1,122 patients from the CLEOPATRA database were considered in this study. Online 238 Supplement E contains the exclusion reasons (Figure E1) and tables with baseline characteristics 239 (Tables E1-3). The main exclusion reasons were: presentation beyond six hours after symptom onset 240 and CTP source data that could not be processed due to anonymization at local sites or discrepancies 241 between local hardware and our CTP software. There were 70/703(10.0%) patients with an 242 ICV\u226570mL, 23/703(3.3%) patients with an ICV\u2265110mL, 19/703(2.7%) patients with an MMR\u22641.8, and 243 5/703(0.7%) patients with an MMR\u22641.4. 244\nBaseline model and one-way sensitivity 245\nIn the baseline simulations, excluding patients with an ICV\u226570mL for EVT resulted in a loss of health 246 (\u0394QALY:-33.8), higher costs (\u0394costs:\u20ac385,866), an ICER of -11,432, and an NMB of -\u20ac3,086,208 per 247 1,000 patients. Excluding patients with an MMR\u22641.8 for EVT resulted in a loss of health (\u0394QALY:-5.8), 248 higher costs (\u0394costs:\u20ac54,836), an ICER of -9,834, and an NMB of -\u20ac500,913 per 1,000 patients. Figure 249 F1 (Online Supplement F) describes the ten model parameters that affected the NMB the most in 250 strategies using ICV or MMR for EVT patient selection. For the ICV simulations, the QALYs for mRS 0-251 2, long-term costs in the third year and beyond for mRS 5, and costs of EVT affected NMB the most. 252 For the MMR simulations, the QALYs in mRS 3-4, costs of EVT, and the costs related to mRS 4 in the 253 first year after AIS affected NMB the most. 254\nProbabilistic sensitivity analysis 255\nFigure 2 depicts the PSA results in incremental cost-effectiveness ratio plots (Figures 2A-B), and the 256 NMB per decision threshold for ICV and MMR-based patient selection (Figures 2C-D). A more 257 detailed overview of the results is provided in Online Supplement F. For all PSAs the optimal 258 thresholds for EVT patient exclusion using were ICV\u2265110 mL and MMR\u22641.4. Using ICV to exclude 259 patients for EVT resulted in a loss of health (\u0394QALYs 5-year median:-3.3[IQR:-5.9;-1.1], 10-year 260 median:-4.3[IQR:-9.1;-0.7]), a limited cost saving (\u0394Costs 5-year median: -\u20ac348,966[IQR:-\u20ac712,406;-261 \u20ac51,158], 10-year median:-\u20ac246,679[IQR:-\u20ac733,714;\u20ac191,840]), a wide IQR for the ICER (ICER 5-year 262 median:71,346[IQR:-16,517;181,241], 10-year median:31,244[IQR:-48,780;141,749]), and an NMB 263 close to zero (NMB 5-year median:\u20ac102,227[IQR:-\u20ac282,942;\u20ac431,923], 10-year median: -\u20ac97,781 264 [IQR:-\u20ac644,889;\u20ac420,136] per 1,000 patients. Using MMR to exclude patients for EVT resulted in a 265 limited to no loss of health (\u0394QALYs 5-year follow-up median:0.0[IQR:-1.3;-0.0], 10-year follow-up 266 median:0.0[IQR:-1.6;-0.0]), higher costs (\u0394Costs 5-year follow-up 267 median:\u20ac266,513[IQR:\u20ac229,403;\u20ac380,110], 10-year follow-up 268 median:\u20ac279,661[IQR:\u20ac229,403;\u20ac464,756]), a wide IQR for the ICER (ICER 5-year follow-up median: 269 312,955[IQR:-141,379;infinite], 10-year follow-up median:249,523[IQR:-118325;infinite]), and a 270 negative NMB (NMB 5-year follow-up median:-\u20ac278,626[IQR:-\u20ac456,559;-\u20ac229,403], 10-year follow-271 up median:-\u20ac279,614 [IQR:-\u20ac555,168;-\u20ac228,836]) per 1,000 patients. Due to the limited number of 272 patients with an ICV above (\u2265110mL) and MMR below (\u22641.4) the optimal decision threshold for EVT 273 patient exclusion, the \u0394QALY results were low. This effect was more profound for MMR compared to 274 ICV-based patient selection; low MMR values were less common than high ICV values. The effect on 275 costs in this small group of patients excluded for EVT was due to a decrease in long-term care costs, 276 related to earlier death, and due to the absence of EVT costs. Subsequently, low \u0394QALY values 277 resulted in an ICER with a wide IQR. 278\n279\n280\nTable 1 describes the ICERs for different shifted values for the EVT effect and EVT effect modification 302 due to ICV or MMR from the baseline levels. Online Supplement F contains more scenarios and 303 reports the ICER, \u0394Costs, and \u0394QALYs. For the simulations using ICV, a higher EVT effect resulted in a 304\nhigher cost saving, a higher QALY loss, and a higher ICER and NMB. A decrease in the ICV-based EVT 305 effect modification resulted in a higher cost saving, a higher QALY loss, with a higher ICER and NMB. 306 For the simulations using MMR, changes in EVT effect or the MMR-based EVT effect modification 307 had a negligible effect on the outcome measures. This was mainly due to the small proportion of 308 patients that had an MMR\u22641.4. Even at the lowest EVT effect and ICV or MMR-based EVT effect 309 modification (lower left corner in the table), the IQR of ICER and NMB included zero indicating no 310 benefit of the use of CTP-based patient selection. 311\n312\nCTP measure and optimized\nthreshold Follow-up\nhorizon (years)\nEffect modification due to ICV or MMR (OR)\nNet monetary benefit (NMB) in \u20ac\nEVT effect OR\n1.17\n(95%CI:0.71;1.8)**\n1.37\n(95%CI:0.91;2.0\n)\n1.67\n(95%CI:1.21;2.3)\n*\n1.97\n(95%CI:1.51;2.6)\n2.49\n(95%CI:2.03;3.12)*\n**\nICV\u2265110mL\n5 0.98 (95%CI:\n0.881;1.091)* 75,260\n(-256,606;356,220)\n92,540\n(-\n274,492;387,168)\n102,227\n(-282,942;431,923)\n115,014\n(-282,947;472,304)\n126,436\n(-294,179;516,591)\n5 0.93 (95%CI:\n0.831;1.041) 52,532\n(-158,294;247,178)\n58,740 (-\n171,751;270,871)\n71,360\n(-189,586;298,635)\n81,540\n(-202,099;334,318)\n95,139\n(-235,410;378,627)\n5 0.88 (95%CI:\n0.781;0.991)\n44,361 (-84,207;180,651)\n45,137 (-97,373;189,920) 52,380 (-117,014;211,993) 57,805 (-131,228;233,197) 69,596 (-146,628;265,746)\n10 0.98 (95%CI:\n0.881;1.091)* -119,896\n(-587,168;333,612)\n-112,504\n(-\n620,679;366957)\n-97,781\n(-644,889;420,136)\n-103,484\n(-659,676;460,891)\n-74,712\n(-685,404;519,196)\n10 0.93 (95%CI:\n0.831;1.041) -82,733\n(-430,820;215,513)\n-89,848\n(-\n460,125;247,493)\n-95,305\n(-508,231;268,169)\n-94,125\n(-521,341;297,295)\n-96,801\n(-565,620;347,538)\n10 0.88 (95%CI:\n0.781;0.991) -24,078\n(-262,408;153,870)\n-38,411 (-\n295,091;163,770)\n-47,193\n(-327,253;184,168)\n-56,497\n(-369,169;205,562)\n-69,079\n(-415,466;234,382)\nMMR\u22641.4\n5 1.010 (95%CI:\n0.994;1.560) -263,889 (-433,414;-\n222,141)\n-267,393 (- 443,666;-\n225,803)\n-278,626 (-\n456,559;-229,403)\n-279,614 (-\n465,361;-229,379)\n-279,614 (-477,472;-\n229,403)\n5 1.060 (95%CI:\n1.044;1.610) -264,070\n(-433,655;-222,185)\n-267,548 (-444,090; -225,943)\n-278,740 (-456,835;-\n229,403)\n-279,614 (-465,472;-\n229,360)\n-279,614\n(-477,681;-229,403)\n5 1.110 (95%CI:\n1.094;1.660) -264,073 (-433,887;-\n222,227)\n-267,696 (-\n444,428;- 226,076)\n-278,850 (- 457,097;-229,403) -279,614 (- 465,577;-229,342) -279,614 (-477,880;- 229,403)\n10 1.010 (95%CI:\n0.994;1.560) -271,910\n(-520,757;-219,184)\n-279,614\n(-534,853; -222,380)\n-279,614\n(-555,168;- 228,836)\n-279,614\n(-570,464;- 229,403)\n-279,614 (-589,096;-229,403)\n10 1.060 (95%CI:\n1.044;1.610) -272,133\n(-521,893;-219,316)\n-279,614\n(-535,771; -222,362)\n-279,614\n(-555,982;-\n228,996)\n-279,614\n(-571,036;-\n229,403)\n-279,614\n(-589,859;-229,403)\n10 1.110 (95%CI:\n1.094;1.660) -272,027\n(-521,338;-219,251)\n-279,614\n(-535,334; -222,371)\n-279,614\n(-555,585;-\n228,917)\n-279,614\n(-570,770;-\n229,403)\n-279,614\n(-589,487;-229,403)\n313\nTable 1. NMB for alternative scenarios of EVT effect and effect modification due to ICV and MMR per 314 1000 patients. Results are presented as median with IQR, the baseline follow-up horizon of 5-year was used. 315 The optimal ICV threshold for patient exclusion for EVT was in all scenarios \u2265110mL, the optimal MMR 316\nthreshold for patient exclusion for EVT was \u22641.4 in all scenarios. Optimal thresholds were based on the 317 maximum net monetary benefit at a willingness to pay of \u20ac80,000. *: The baseline ORs from the MR CLEAN 318 trial for EVT effect (9) and the study by Campbell et al. for ICV based effect modification (4). **: Just below the 319 mean EVT effect of patients with a large infarct on NCCT (ASPECTS<6) in the HERMES pooling. ***: EVT effect 320 found in the HERMES pooling (1). A lower EVT effect and a lower ICV or MMR based EVT effect modification 321 are more beneficial scenarios for using CTP for EVT patient selection. ICER: incremental cost effectiveness 322 ratio.

CTP: CT perfusion. 324\n325\nElderly subgroup: most favorable CTP for EVT selection scenario 326\nThe reduced life expectancy in the subgroup of patients \u226580 years resulted in a less profound loss of 327 QALYs (\u0394QALYs ICV median:0.0[IQR:-0.8;0.5], MMR median:-1.2[IQR:-8.8;0.0]) and additional costs 328 (\u0394Costs ICV median:\u20ac34920[IQR:-\u20ac293,371;\u20ac524,269], MMR median:-\u20ac229,448[IQR:-329 \u20ac1,178,568;\u20ac461,962]). However, IQRs of the ICER (ICV median: 120,757[IQR:-343,877;932,702], 330 MMR median:88,483[IQR:-61,501;65,3609]) and NMB (ICV median:\u20ac23,425[IQR:-331 \u20ac461,957;\u20ac305,633], MMR median:\u20ac108,270[IQR:-\u20ac775,446;\u20ac1,004,928]) per 1,000 patients still 332 included zero. Figure 3 contains the ICER plot for the elderly subgroup PSA with the most favorable 333 scenario for ICV and MMR based patient selection. 334\n335\n336\n337\n338\nDiscussion 350\nIn the baseline scenario, using the baseline CTP parameter estimates ICV or MMR for EVT patient 351 selection within six hours after symptom onset resulted in no additional costs or cost savings, a loss 352 of health, an NMB close to zero, and an ICER with a wide IQR compared to providing EVT to all 353 patients. We observed a reduction in the loss of health and an increase in costs if the EVT benefit 354 would be lower and when the benefit of EVT diminishes further for patients with a larger ICV and a 355 lower MMR. For a low EVT effect and high reduction of EVT effect modification due to ICV and MMR, 356 the simulation resulted \u2013 at best \u2013 in a negligible loss of health for no additional costs and thus an 357\nNMB close to zero. Even under unlikely favorable conditions, in patients aged \u226580 years, assuming a 358 low EVT benefit, and a high decline of EVT effect due to ICV or MMR, CTP-based EVT patient 359 selection was not cost-effective. 360\nTo interpret the results of this study, the presented scenarios should be compared with the best 361 available evidence. The EVT effect and EVT effect modification due to ICV and MMR were more 362 conservative compared to the three recent EVT trials.1\u20133 Therefore, the results from this study at 363 baseline simulation values might present a scenario less favorable for outcomes after EVT and thus 364 more favorable for CTP-based patient selection. In light of recent and ongoing AIS workflow 365 improvements, it seems likely that the benefit of EVT will only increase in the coming years.26 Since 366 we did not observe a benefit of CTP-based patient selection in more favorable scenarios, 367 technological improvements of CTP acquisition and software analyses might be futile to further 368 improve CTP-based EVT patient selection.10 Finally, in the most favorable CTP-based EVT patient 369 selection scenario, we considered a lower EVT effect for patients aged \u226580 years. However, current 370 evidence suggests a higher EVT effect for patients aged \u226585 years while we used a reduced EVT 371 effect.27 Other research suggests that patients aged \u226575 years with ICV \u226550 or \u226585 mL might have a 372 lower EVT effect.5 373\nOur study has limitations. First, we did not use prospectively collected data regarding treatment 374 effect and CTP-based effect modification, long-term mRS follow-up, and cost data. Due to the 375 retrospective nature of this study, we could have missed patients that would not benefit from EVT 376 such as patients with a worse pre-morbid functional status. Second, we used cost data from a 377 healthcare payer perspective, neglecting potential effects due to indirect costs related to for 378 example labor productivity in young AIS patients. Third, CTP might be used to improve occlusion 379 detection and IVT administration.9,28 Thus, the actual added value of CTP in the diagnostic workup of 380 patients with AIS might be higher due to the beneficial effect on occlusion detection. Fourth, we only 381 included CTP results from one single vendor with fixed settings. This reduces part of the variation in 382\nmeasurements compared to real-world measurements which likely vary between centers due to the 383 variation of analytical CTP software packages.29,30 As a result \u2013 even though no benefit of CTP for 384 patient selection for EVT was found \u2013 findings from this study may be too optimistic, making it very 385 unlikely that using CTP for the selection for EVT within 6 hours after symptom onset is currently \u2013 386 or, with improvements, will soon become \u2013 cost-effective. Further improvements in the CTP 387 acquisition and analysis could also alter the association between the CTP measures and outcome, 388 without EVT effect modification, and thus affect the cost-effectiveness. This effect is not covered in 389 this study. 390\nFuture work should investigate the cost-effectiveness of CTP-based patient selection in sub-391 populations with a high risk of poor functional outcome. For example, patients presenting after six 392 hours from stroke onset, elderly patients, patients with pre-morbid disability, or complex co-393 morbidities as these patients might have a reduced benefit from EVT.31 However, as represented by 394 the baseline characteristics in this study, this combination of highly unfavorable baseline 395 characteristics is rare in our AIS population.5 Furthermore, long-term follow-up studies and cost-396 effectiveness analyses of the large infarct RCTs will provide a higher level of evidence.1\u20133 397\nConclusion 398\nIn this Dutch, nationwide cohort study with a model-based health economic evaluation, the use of 399 CTP-estimated ischemic core volume or core-penumbra mismatch ratio to exclude patients 400 presenting within six hours after symptom onset from endovascular treatment resulted in a loss of 401 health and no cost savings. Additional simulations revealed that under unlikely favorable conditions, 402 these findings did not change. The use of CTP-based parameters to exclude patients from EVT is 403 unlikely to be cost-effective and may potentially harm EVT-eligible patients who present within six 404 hours after onset. 405\n406\nReferences 407\n1.

Data can be obtained 502 from https://www.contrast-consortium.nl/data-request-form/. The data will be made available to 503 researchers who are CONTRAST consortium members or collaborators, and whose proposed use of 504 the data has been approved by the CONTRAST data access and writing committee. The data will be 505 made available for specified purposes, as defined in the sub study proposal and approved by the 506 CONTRAST data access and writing committee. The data will be made available after approval of the 507 proposal by the CONTRAST data access and writing committee. To ensure publication transparency 508 and quality, researchers should adhere to the CONTRAST publication policy, accessible on 509 https://www.contrast-consortium.nl/publication- policy-contrast/. For the patients included in the 510 MR CLEAN Registry and the local cohort, individual patient data cannot be made available under Dutch 511 law since we did not obtain patient approval for sharing individual patient data. All syntax files and 512 output of statistical analyses are available on reasonable request to the corresponding author. 513 514"
