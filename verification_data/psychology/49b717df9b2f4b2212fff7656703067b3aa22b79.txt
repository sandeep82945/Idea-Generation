"The greatest electrochemical activity of the Co-MOF/50% CNTs composite over the other catalysts may be due to the existence of CNTs in the composite with fewer aggregations, higher active sites due to the open structure, and lower electrode resistance. These features endow the structure with great electronic conductivity, enhance the surface area, and facilitate ion transportation during redox reactions. Furthermore, in Co-MOF/50% CNTs, the acceptable percentage of CNTs, uniform distribution between Co-MOF layers, and co-existence of Co2+ and Co3+ oxidation states caused an increase in the current density from 4.5 mA cm−2 to 35 mA cm−2 at 0.335 V and a scan rate of 50 mV s−1, and improved its stability for up to 3600 s with a retention of 87.6%. Undoubtedly, the proposed strategy can be extended to open an avenue toward the synthesis of numerous composites of mixed-metallic MOFs with carbon-based material nanostructures to achieve low-cost, efficient, and stable catalysts for methanol oxidation in fuel cell applications."
