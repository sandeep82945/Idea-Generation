Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) act as crucial regulators of diverse biological processes. However, lncRNAs in ginger are not yet identified so far, and their potential roles in gingerol biosynthesis are still unknown. In this study, metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses were performed in three main ginger cultivars (leshanhuangjiang, tonglingbaijiang, and yujiang 1 hao) in China to understand the potential roles of the specific lncRNAs in gingerol accumulation. Results A total of 744 metabolites were monitored by metabolomics analysis, which were divided into eleven categories. Among them, the largest group phenolic acid category contained 143 metabolites, including 21 gingerol derivatives. Of which, three gingerol analogs, [8]-shogaol, [10]-gingerol, and [12]-shogaol, accumulated significantly. Moreover, 16,346 lncRNAs, including 2,513, 1,225, and 2,884 differentially expressed (DE) lncRNA genes (DELs), were identified in all three comparisons by transcriptomic analysis. Gene ontology enrichment (GO) analysis showed that the DELs mainly enriched in the secondary metabolite biosynthetic process, response to plant hormones, and phenol-containing compound metabolic process. Correlation analysis revealed that the expression levels of 11 DE gingerol biosynthesis enzyme genes (GBEGs) and 190 transcription factor genes (TF genes), such as MYB1, ERF100, WRKY40, etc. were strongly correlation coefficient with the contents of the three gingerol analogs. Furthermore, 7 and 111 upstream cis-acting lncRNAs, 1,200 and 2,225 upstream trans-acting lncRNAs corresponding to the GBEGs and TF genes were identified, respectively. Interestingly, 1,184 DELs might function as common upstream regulators to these GBEGs and TFs genes, such as LNC_008452, LNC_006109, LNC_004340, etc. Furthermore, protein\u2013protein Wenlin Zhang, Yang Yang and Xuedong Zhu contributed equally to this work. *Correspondence: Jianmin Tang tangjmjy@163.com Guohua Zhao zhaogh@swu.edu.cn Lin Wu wulin2022@swu.edu.cn Full list of author information is available at the end of the article Page 2 of 15 Zhang et al. BMC Genomics (2023) 24:490 interaction networks (PPI) analysis indicated that three TF proteins, MYB4, MYB43, and WRKY70 might interact with four GBEG proteins (PAL1, PAL2, PAL3, and 4CL-4). Conclusion Based on these findings, we for the first time worldwide proposed a putative regulatory cascade of lncRNAs, TFs genes, and GBEGs involved in controlling of gingerol biosynthesis. These results not only provide novel insights into the lncRNAs involved in gingerol metabolism, but also lay a foundation for future in-depth studies of the related molecular mechanism.",

Among them, the largest group phenolic acid category contained 143 metabolites, including 21 gingerol derivatives. Of which, three gingerol analogs, [8]-shogaol, [10]-gingerol, and [12]-shogaol, accumulated significantly. Moreover, 16,346 lncRNAs, including 2,513, 1,225, and 2,884 differentially expressed (DE) lncRNA genes (DELs), were identified in all three comparisons by transcriptomic analysis. Gene ontology enrichment (GO) analysis showed that the DELs mainly enriched in the secondary metabolite biosynthetic process, response to plant hormones, and phenol-containing compound metabolic process. Correlation analysis revealed that the expression levels of 11 DE gingerol biosynthesis enzyme genes (GBEGs) and 190 transcription factor genes (TF genes), such as MYB1, ERF100, WRKY40, etc. were strongly correlation coefficient with the contents of the three gingerol analogs. Furthermore, 7 and 111 upstream cis-acting lncRNAs, 1,200 and 2,225 upstream trans-acting lncRNAs corresponding to the GBEGs and TF genes were identified, respectively. Interestingly, 1,184 DELs might function as common upstream regulators to these GBEGs and TFs genes, such as LNC_008452, LNC_006109, LNC_004340, etc. Furthermore, protein\u2013protein\n\u2020Wenlin Zhang, Yang Yang and Xuedong Zhu contributed equally to this work.\n*Correspondence: Jianmin Tang tangjmjy@163.com Guohua Zhao zhaogh@swu.edu.cn Lin Wu wulin2022@swu.edu.cn Full list of author information is available at the end of the article\ninteraction networks (PPI) analysis indicated that three TF proteins, MYB4, MYB43, and WRKY70 might interact with four GBEG proteins (PAL1, PAL2, PAL3, and 4CL-4).\nConclusion Based on these findings, we for the first time worldwide proposed a putative regulatory cascade of lncRNAs, TFs genes, and GBEGs involved in controlling of gingerol biosynthesis. These results not only provide novel insights into the lncRNAs involved in gingerol metabolism, but also lay a foundation for future in-depth studies of the related molecular mechanism.\nKeywords Ginger, Metabolomics, Transcriptomics, Long non-coding RNAs, Gingerol biosynthesis"

            "text": "Ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe), a perennial herb belonging to the Zingiberaceae family, has been widely used worldwide as a spice and medicine for over 2,000\u00a0 years [1, 2]. Ginger contains more than 60 bioactive compounds, such as phenolic compounds, terpenes, polysaccharides, lipids, and raw fibers. Among them, phenolic compounds, especially gingerols, representing a series of phenol analogs consisting of shogaols, paradols, and gingerone, are the characteristic health-promoting constituent for ginger [2, 3]. Notably [6]-gingerol is of higher abundance component [2, 4]. For example, Jiang et\u00a0 al. monitored the contents of gingerols in ginger rhizomes by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS) analysis. The results exhibited that [6]-gingerol was the major constituent of gingerols with a mean value of 195.87\u00a0\u03bcg/g; whereas the contents of other gingerols, such as [8]-gingerol and [10]-gingerol, were much lower [5]. Now, clinical studies have shown that gingerols, specifically [6]-gingerol, are promising in the treatment of degenerative disorders, vomiting, and cancer [6]. Additionally, gingerols are also proved to exhibit anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties [7]. Therefore, gingerols possess important medicinal value.\nRecently, based on available findings, we proposed a backbone biosynthetic pathway for gingerols based on chromosome-scale reference genome assembly, metabolomics, and transcriptome analysis [2]. Briefly, this complicated pathway is composed of two consecutive steps and 12 gingerol biosynthesis enzyme gene (GBEG) families involved in phenylalanine ammonia lyase gene (PAL), cinnamate 4-hydroxylase gene (C4H), 4-coumarateCoA ligase gene (4CL), p-coumaroyl shikimate transferase gene (CST), p-coumaroyl 5-O-quinate/shikimate 3\u2019-hydroxylase gene (C3\u2019H), caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase gene (C3OMT), caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase gene (CCOMT), caffeoylshikimate esterase gene (CSE), polyketide synthase gene (PKS), NADPH-dependent alkanal/one oxidoreductase gene (AOR), dehydrogenase gene (DHN), and dehydratase gene (DHT) [2]. The first part is mainly composed of the catalysis the formation of feruloyl-CoA catalyzed from L-phenylalanine, which is also the main synthesis pathway of lignin or anthocyanins\n[8, 9]. Therefore, the enzymes that participate in this process are relatively conserved in most plants [2]. The specific enzymes to the Zingiberaceae family, such as PKS, AOR, DHN, and DHT, are involved in the second steps of the pathway and contribute to the catalysis the formation of gingerols from feruloyl-CoA [2, 10]. Meanwhile, transcription factors (TFs) from several families are involved in controlling gingerols biosynthesis, such as v-myb avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog (MYB), basic leucine zipper (bZIP), DNA binding with one finger (DOF), and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) [2, 4].\nLong non-coding RNA genes (lncRNAs), previously considered as expression noise of protein-coding genes, are a class of transcripts with a length > 200\u00a0bp and lack of coding ability [11, 12]. Notably, lncRNAs are primarily divided into three categories according to their location in the genome, including long intergenic lncRNAs (lincRNAs), intronic lncRNAs, and antisense lncRNAs [13]. With the development of next-generation sequencing technologies, abundant lncRNAs have been identified in diverse plant species, such as melon (Cucumis melo L.), kiwifruit (Actinidia chinensis), rice (Oryza sativa), Chinese plum (prunus mume), and cabbage (Brassica rapa L.) [12, 14\u201317]. The expression levels of most human lncRNA genes are lower than those of protein-coding genes, and lncRNA genes are not conserved even for closely related species [18]. In recent years, a number of lncRNAs have been reported to involve in diverse plant biological processes, such as plant growth, flowering, anthocyanin biosynthesis, and biotic/abiotic stress. For example, a lncRNA salicylic acid biogenesis controller 1 (SABC1) functions as a molecular switch to balance plant defense and growth in Arabidopsis [19]. In healthy plants, SABC1 represses the expression of its neighboring gene NAC3 via H3K27me3, which further inhibits the transcription of the isochorismate synthase 1 (ICS1) responsible for salicylic acid (SA) biosynthesis. Conversely, the repression by SABC1 was released to enhance plant resistance to pathogen infection [19]. Moreover, the lncRNA AUXIN REGULATED PROMOTER LOOP (APOLO) interacts with the transcription factor WRKY42 to control the transcription of ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE 6 (RHD6), ultimately leading\nto the root-hair elongation [20]. In apples, the lncRNA MdLNC610 positively regulates high light-induced anthocyanin accumulation through modulating the expression of MdACO1 and inducing the ethylene production [21]. Furthermore, two lncRNAs, cold-induced antisense intragenic RNA (COOLAIR) and cold-assisted intronic non-coding RNA (COLDAIR), are identified to promote flowering in Arabidopsis by silencing the floral repressor Flowering Locus C (FLC) [22, 23]. Interestingly, some lncRNAs act as endogenous target mimics (eTM) to interrupt the binding of microRNAs (miRNAs) to their targets [24]. For example, overexpression of the lncRNA TCONS_00021861 confers tolerance to drought stress in rice by means of attenuating the repression of miR5283p to the expression of critical auxin biosynthesis gene YUCCA7 [25]. These findings clearly demonstrated that lncRNAs play a vital regulatory role in plant growth and secondary metabolism.\nHowever, lncRNAs in ginger are not yet identified so far, and the relationship between lncRNAs and gingerol biosynthesis remains still unknown. Recently, a study based on integrative transcriptome and phytochemical analyses has unraveled the critical lncRNAs modulating secondary metabolites in Oolong tea [26]. Accordingly, in this study, we firstly characterized metabolites in the mature rhizomes of three main ginger cultivars in China: leshanhuangjiang (lshj), tonglingbaij (tlbj), and\nyujiang 1 hao (yj1h). To identify ginger lncRNAs and to investigate the regulatory role of them in gingerol biosynthesis, genome-wide high-throughput sequencing was performed. Subsequently, lncRNAs involved in gingerol biosynthesis were tentatively identified and characterized through integrating analysis of transcriptome and metabolome. Finally, a putative regulatory network of lncRNAs, GBEGs, and TF genes, were proposed. The results not only highlight novel insights into the understanding of the gingerol biosynthesis in ginger, but also lay a basis for functional research of the candidate lncRNAs."

            "text": "In total, 744 metabolites were identified by an ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem triple quadrupole /mass spectrometry (UPLCESI\u2013MS/MS), which were divided into eleven categories (Fig.\u00a0 1B, Fig. S1, Table S2). Among them, the phenolic acid category contained 143 metabolites, which was the largest group, followed by lipids, flavonoids, amino acids and derivatives, others, organic acids, nucleotides and derivatives, alkaloids, lignans and coumarins, terpenoids, and tannins (Fig.\u00a01B). The amounts of [6]-gingerol, [8]-gingerdione, [6]-shogaol, [10]-shogaol, and [8]-gingerol were the top five compounds in phenolic acid category (Table S2). Moreover, lysoPC 18:2(2n isomer),\ndiosmetin-7-O-rutinoside (diosmin), L-isoleucine, 5-hydroxy1,7-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)heptan-3-one, citric acid, adenosine, spermine, 7-methoxy-5-prenyloxycoumarin, nootkatol, and procyanidin B3, were the highest compound in other ten metabolic categories, respectively (Table S2). These results imply that ginger rhizomes are rich in various bioactive compounds, especially phenolic acids.\nNext, these metabolites were analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA). The results showed that lower variability was found among the three biological replicates for each ginger cultivar (Fig.\u00a0 1C). Principal component 1 and principal component 2 accounted for 50.76% and 28.84% of the metabolic variance among these samples, respectively, and resulting in a distinct separation of three cultivars. Furthermore, hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was conducted to detect changes in metabolites in all samples based on their relative contents (Fig.\u00a0 1D). Consistent with the results of the PCA analysis, the HCA results showed that the contents of most metabolites detected in the rhizomes had high heterogeneity between different ginger cultivars, while there was high homogeneity among the three biological replicates of each variety. Furthermore, the correlation among\nall metabolite data was analyzed, as shown in Fig. S2. These results suggest that there was a good correlation among replicates.\nThe metabolic diversity in\u00a0the\u00a0rhizomes of\u00a0three ginger cultivars The contents of 200 metabolites were differentially accumulated between leshanhuangjiang (lshj) and yujiang 1 hao (yj1h); 109 metabolites showed diverse enrichment in tonglingbaij (tlbj) vs. leshanhuangjiang (lshj); and 228 metabolites exhibited different changes in tonglingbaij (tlbj) vs. yujiang 1 hao (yj1h) (Fig.\u00a0 2C, Tables S3-S5). Of them, 35 metabolites showed altered accumulation among all pairwise comparisons, including one amino acid and its derivative, fifteen flavonoids, two lignans and coumarins, five lipids, one nucleotide, and its derivative, four organic acids, three phenolic acids, one tannin, and three other metabolites (Fig.\u00a0 2C). Additionally, based on K-means analysis, all metabolites with diverse accumulation in three cultivars could be divided into eight subclasses (Fig.\u00a0 2A). In these subclasses, cultivarspecific subclasses were identified. For instance, tlbj was rich in metabolites in subclasses 1 and 4; and lshj was rich in metabolites in subclasses 2, 3, and 7. However, the\nmetabolites in subclasses 5 and 8 were the richest in yj1h (Fig.\u00a02A).\nAs for the importance of gingerols in ginger, we specifically compared the contents of the gingerols and gingerol biosynthetic substrates in this study. Noticeably, a total of 24 gingerol analogs were identified in these metabolites (Fig.\u00a02B). Of which, 21 gingerol analogs were identified in the phenolic acid category and the other three were monitored in the others group (Table S2). Moreover, five gingerol biosynthetic substrates (L-phenylalanine, cinnamic acid, p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, and ferulic acid), were also identified (Fig.\u00a02B, Table S2). Notably, three derivatives of gingerols were clearly different. The [8]-shogaol (p < 0.001), [10]-gingerol (p < 0.001), and [12]-shogaol (p < 0.001) contents in the rhizomes of lshj were significantly higher than those in yj1h (Fig.\u00a0 2B, Table S3). Similarly, the amounts of [12]-shogaol in tlbj were markedly higher (p < 0.001) than those in yj1h (Fig.\u00a02B, Table S5). Additionally, compared to lshj, the accumulation of [8]-shogaol was significantly lower (p < 0.001) in tlbj (Fig.\u00a02B, Table S4).\nHigh\u2011throughput sequencing and\u00a0genome\u2011wide identification of\u00a0lncRNAs in\u00a0ginger Totally, 93,500,930, 87,662,184, 88,946,816, 81,385,016, 95,576,162, 93,040,956, 185,002,632, 89,949,264 and 92,583,882 raw reads were gained from 9 libraries, respectively. Correspondingly, 92,361,278, 86,356,308, 87,596,080, 80,088,006, 94,078,706, 91,776,760, 181,826,106, 88,852,328, and 91,640,532 clean reads with high Q20 and Q30 were obtained from each library, respectively (Table S6). Of the 69.60%\u201380.88% clean reads which could be mapped to our Z. officinale Roscoe genome, 56.80%\u201364.13% of them were uniquely mapped reads (Table S7). In total, 16,346 lncRNAs were identified (Fig.\u00a0 3A, Tables S8). According to the genomic location relationship between lncRNAs and known protein-coding genes, these lncRNAs were divided into three categories: 12,661 (77.4%) long intergenic lncRNAs (lincRNAs, that do not overlap with the exons of any other genes), 978 (6.0%) antisense lncRNAs (those are located on the opposite strand of a known protein-coding gene and transcribed in the antisense direction), and 2,707 (16.6%) intronic lncRNAs (that are located and transcribed within introns of known protein-coding genes) (Fig.\u00a03B). Moreover, the length, exon number, and chromosome distribution of the lncRNAs were compared with those of the protein-coding genes. The results showed that the length of most lncRNAs was 201\u20131,000 nt, and the number of lncRNAs gradually decreased along with increasing transcript length. Furthermore, the length of the lncRNAs ranged from 201 to 11,020 bp, with an average length of 789 bp (Table S8). Interestingly, protein-coding genes over 4,000 nt in length were higher in number in our RNA-seq data (Fig.\u00a03C). Furthermore, most lncRNAs had fewer than six exons, whereas more than 15,000\nprotein-coding genes possessed more than 10 exons (Fig.\u00a0 3D). Additionally, these lncRNAs were distributed on 11 chromosomes, with the largest numbers on chromosomes 4 and 6, respectively (Fig.\u00a0 3E). It also showed that the expression levels of lncRNAs were lower than those of protein-coding genes (Fig. S3).\nIdentification of\u00a0differentially expressed lncRNA genes (DELs) and\u00a0protein\u2011coding genes (DEPCGs) To screen for differentially expressed (DE) lncRNA genes and protein-coding genes in the three ginger cultivars, three pairwise comparisons were analyzed in this study. Based on the threshold value of |log2(fold change)|> 1 and an adjusted p-value < 0.05, 2,513 (2,013 upregulated and 510 downregulated), 1,225 (791 upregulated and 434 downregulated), and 2,884 (2,520 upregulated and 364 downregulated) DELs were identified in the comparisons between lshj vs. yj1h, tlbj vs. lshj, and tlbj vs. yj1h, respectively (Fig. S4A-C, Table S9-S11). Venn analysis revealed that 129 DELs exhibited transcriptional changes in all three comparisons (Fig. S4D). In addition, 3,898 (2,339 upregulated and 1,559 downregulated), 2,281 (1,104 upregulated and 1,177 downregulated), and 4,221 (2,613 upregulated and 1,608 downregulated) DEPCGs were identified in the comparisons of lshj vs. yj1h, tlbj vs. lshj, and tlbj vs. yj1h, respectively (Fig. S5A-C, Table S12-S14). Of which, 181 DEPCGs were shared in all three comparisons via the Venn analysis (Fig. S5D). Additionally, the K-means analysis showed that these DELs were divided into four types of expression patterns in the three ginger cultivars. The expression levels of DELs in subclasses 1 and 4 were the highest in the rhizomes of yj1h. Conversely, the DELs transcripts in subclasses 2 and 3 were higher in lshj and tlbj, respectively (Fig. S6A). Noticeably, the K-means analysis exhibited that these DEPCGs were divided into ten types of different expression patterns. For example, the DEPCGs expression levels in subclasses 1, 4, 7, and 8 were higher in yj1h, while the transcripts of DEPCGs in subclasses 6, 9, and 10 were higher in tlbj; conversely, the DEPCGs in subclasses 2, 3, and 5 showed higher expression levels in lshj (Fig. S6B)."

            "text": "DEPCG targets located within 100\u00a0kb upstream or downstream of DELs were screened as potential cis-regulated targets of DELs [27]. 883 out of 2,513, 350 out of 1,225, and 1,123 out of 2,884 DELs identified potential cisregulated targets in lshj vs. yj1h, tlbj vs. lshj, and tlbj vs. yj1h, respectively. Several DELs possessed at least two DEPCG targets (Fig. S7A, Table S15-S17). In addition, we screened DEPCGs showing similar expression patterns to those of DELs, which were defined as potential trans-regulated targets of DELs [28]. 1,437 out of 2,513,\n1,222 out of 1,225, and 1,358 out of 2,884 might play a trans-acting role in the regulation of DEPCGs. Similarly, those DELs might function as common upstream regulators to abundant DEPCGs (Fig. S7B, Table S18). Next, to validate the results of potential DEPCG targets of DELs, qRT-PCR was performed. The expression patterns of 11 DEPCGs and 11 corresponding DELs were monitored. Among them, ZoLNC_008531, ZoLNC_008529, ZoLNC_010979, and ZoLNC_007353 regulated the expression levels of ZoPAL1, ZoPAL2-like, ZoCSE7, and ZoAOR1, respectively, in the cis-acting model. The ZoLNC_003688, ZoLNC_002194, ZoLNC_011938, ZoLNC_006429, ZoLNC_000552, ZoLNC_005593, as well as ZoLNC_000739 responded to control the transcripts of ZoPAL2, Zo4CL-like, ZoPAL6, ZoPAL-like, Zo4CL-4, ZoPAL3, and ZoPKS14 in the trans-acting model. The expression patterns of the selected DELs and DEPCGs determined by qRT-PCR were consistent with those in the RNA-seq data (R2 = 0.8832) (Fig.\u00a04, Fig. S8). This suggested that the results of potential DEPCG targets of DELs were highly reliable.\nFunctional analysis of\u00a0DELs based on\u00a0their potential targets Based on the cis- and trans-acting models, the functions of the DELs were first analyzed through Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis in the three comparisons. For instance, the DELs involved in the secondary metabolite biosynthetic process (GO:0044550), response to plant hormones (GO:0009753, GO:0010337), and phenol-containing compound metabolic process (GO:0018958), etc., were enriched (Fig. S9).\nIn addition, functional prediction of the DELs was performed using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses (Fig.\u00a0 5). The DELs functioned in the plant hormone signal transduction (ko04075), biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (ko01110), phenylpropanoid biosynthesis (ko00940), MAPK signaling pathway (ko04016), etc., were enriched (Fig.\u00a05).\nThe contributions of\u00a0DELs to\u00a0gingerol biosynthesis by\u00a0targeting the\u00a0key enzyme genes and\u00a0transcription factor genes in\u00a0ginger rhizomes To obtain the DELs that participated in the regulation of gingerol biosynthesis, we first screened differentially expressed (DE) gingerol biosynthesis enzyme genes (GBEGs) in the three comparisons. Totally, 22 DE GBEGs were identified (Fig.\u00a0 6A). Subsequently, a correlation analysis was constructed between three significantly different gingerols ([10]-gingerol (mws1561), [12]-shogaol (Hmsp008976), and [8]-shogaol (Hmsp008707)) and 22 DE GBEGs (Table S19). Interestingly, the expression\nlevels of 11 DE GBEGs (PAL-like, PAL1, PAL2, PAL2-like, PAL3, PAL6, AOR1, 4CL-4, 4CL-like, CSE7, and PKS14) showed a high correlation coefficient with the contents of three gingerol analogs (p-value < 0.01), Table S20). Moreover, DELs with a potential role in controlling the 11 GBEGs were screened. Among them, PAL1, PAL2like, PAL3, CES-7, and AOR1 could be targeted by 7 DELs using a cis-acting model (Table S21). Using a trans-acting model, 1,200 DELs were identified as upstream regulators to the 11 GBEGs (Fig.\u00a06B, Table S22). Interestingly, some DELs may target several gingerol biosynthesis enzyme genes. For example, three DELs (LNC_014041, LNC_008010, and LNC_005460) have been identified as potential regulators of at least seven gingerol biosynthetic enzyme genes (Fig.\u00a06B, Table S21, S22).\nNext, we screened the differentially expressed transcription factor (DE TF) genes, which expression patterns shown a high correlation coefficient with the contents of three gingerol analogs in three ginger cultivars (p-value < 0.01). A total of 190 DE TF genes were identified, which were grouped into 32 TF families (Fig.\u00a06C, Table S23). Among them, 24 TF genes belonged to MYB TF family, which were the largest group, followed by ERF TF family (19 members), NAC TF family (16 members), C3H TF family (15 members), HD-ZIP TF family (14 members), etc. (Fig.\u00a06C, Table S23). Cis-acting model analysis indicated that 83 out of 190 TF genes possessed their corresponding 111 upstream cis-regulating\nDELs (Table S24). Interestingly, all 190 TF genes could be targeted by 2,225 trans-regulating DELs (Fig.\u00a0 6D, Table S25). Moreover, we analyzed the potential interaction proteins to 11 GBEGs by protein\u2013protein interaction networks (PPI) analysis. 44 proteins were identified to interact with 4 GBEGs including PAL1, PAL2, PAL3, and 4CL4. Among them, 3 TF proteins (MYB4, MYB43, and WRKY70) and 2 flavonoid biosynthesis related proteins (TT4 and TT7) were found (Fig.\u00a06E). Based on these results, a network of multiple critical lncRNAs in gingerol biosynthesis was constructed (Fig.\u00a0 6F). However, further studies are needed to better understand their molecular mechanisms."

Furthermore, lncRNAs could directly or indirectly control the transcripts of TFs genes under cis/trans-acting models, which then directly or indirectly modulate GBEGs expression to regulate gingerol biosynthesis. Meanwhile, these TFs also could directly or indirectly feedback control lncRNAs expression\nmetabolites could be divided into eight subclasses, and the cultivar-specific subclasses were identified using K-means analysis (Fig.\u00a02A). These results could not only help us to better evaluate the edible and medicinal value of the three ginger cultivars, but also provide a theoretical basis to manipulate different gingerol content in ginger breeding.\nNoticeably, the contents of [10]-gingerol, [12]-shogaol, and [8]-shogaol were significantly different among the three cultivars (Fig.\u00a02, Tables S3-S5). The concentrations of [10]-gingerol and [12]-shogaol in the rhizomes were in the order tonglingbaijiang (tlbj) > leshanhuangjiang (lshj) > yujiang1hao (yj1h) (Fig.\u00a0 2, Table S2). The accumulation of [8]-shogaol was higher in lshj than in tlbj and yj1h, whereas no significant difference was found between tlbj and yj1h (Fig.\u00a02, Table S2). This is consistent with our previous report that the yj1h is more suitable for use as a table vegetable because of its lower gingerol content [30].\nMoreover, a total of 16,346 lncRNA genes were identified in ginger by RNA-seq, including 12,661 (77.4%) long intergenic lncRNAs (lincRNAs), 978 (6.0%) antisense lncRNAs, and 2,707 (16.6%) intronic lncRNAs (Fig.\u00a0 3). The results showed that ginger contains a higher number of lincRNAs than other plant species, such as maize and rice [16, 31]. Furthermore, the structural analysis revealed that the average length of lncRNA genes was shorter than that of protein-coding genes, and the expression levels of lncRNA genes were lower than those of protein-coding genes (Fig.\u00a0 3C, Fig. S3), which are in agreement with those of previous studies [32]. Interestingly, the mean length (789\u00a0bp) of the lncRNAs in ginger was longer than that of other species, that is, 285, 364, 463, and 323\u00a0 bp for Arabidopsis, maize, kiwifruit, and rice, respectively. It is because the average length of lncRNAs is different in species [33].\nAdditionally, 2,513, 1,225, and 2,884 differentially expressed lncRNAs (DELs) were identified in the comparisons of lshj vs. yj1h, tlbj vs. lshj, and tlbj vs. yj1h, respectively (Fig. S4, Table S9-S11). Among them, 7 cis-acting and 1,200 trans-acting DELs were respectively identified as upstream regulators to 11 gingerol biosynthesis enzyme genes (GBEGs), which showed a highly significant correlation coefficient (p-value < 0.01) with three differentially accumulated ginger analogs (Fig. S7, Table S21 and S22). In particular, 4CL is a critical gene for catalyzing steps involving p-coumaroyl-CoA and feruloyl-CoA, thereby generating enough substrates for the synthesis of gingerols [1, 34]. In the present study, we found that the transcripts of two 4CL genes (4CL-4 and 4CLlike) showed a strongly positive correlation of expression levels with the contents of [10]-gingerol (mws1561, index = 0.937, p-value = 0.00018) and [12]-shogaol\n(Hmsp008976, index = 0.931, p-value = 0.00027) in ginger rhizomes and might be targeted by 512 and 352 transacting DELs, respectively (Fig.\u00a0 6A and B, Tables S21 and S22). These data provide evidence that lncRNAs are related to ginger analogs biosynthesis via the regulation of various GBEGs, specifically 4CL expression. In oolong tea, 4CL expression was inhibited by the low expression of lncRNA LTCONS-00054003, which participates in the regulation of flavonoid accumulation [26]. Interestingly, the DE C3OMT family gene, C3OMT-2, its expression levels did not exhibit a high correlation coefficient to the contents of [8]-shogaol (index = 0.027, p-value = 0.944) in our research, which has been identified as a critical gene that participated in gingerols biosynthesis in previous study [1].\nOn the other hand, we also found that 32 transcription factor (TF) families including 190 TF genes had a highly significant correlation coefficient (p value < 0.01) with the amounts of [8]-shogaol, [10]-gingerol, or [12]-shogaol. (Fig.\u00a0 6C, Table S23). These TF genes were significantly enriched in all DEGs by 2 \u00d7 2 Fisher exact test (p-value = 1.433e-13). Furthermore, among these TF proteins, MYB4, MYB43, and WRKY70 might interact with PAL1, PAL2, PAL3, and 4CL4 (Fig.\u00a0 6E). These results suggested that TFs genes might participate in gingerol biosynthesis not only through regulation of GBEGs gene expression at transcriptional level, but also by affecting GBEGs enzyme activities at post-transcriptional level. We also found that 111 cis-acting and 2,225 trans-acting DELs could regulate these TF genes expression levels, suggesting that lncRNAs also participate in controlling gingerol biosynthesis by regulating the transcription of TFs genes (Fig.\u00a06D, Tables S24 and S25). Similar results have demonstrated that the lncRNA/TF regulatory module controls other secondary metabolic biosynthesis, such as anthocyanin biosynthesis. For example, in sea buckhorn fruits, one lncRNA LNC1 promotes anthocyanin biosynthesis by acting as endogenous target mimics of miR156a to reduce the expression levels of SPL9; in contrast, LNC2 reduces anthocyanin biosynthesis by inducing transcripts of MYB114 [32]. Moreover, it was recently reported that the MdWRKY1-MdLNC499MdERF109 transcriptional cascade is involved in lightinduced anthocyanin accumulation in apples [35].\nIn addition to controlling gingerol biosynthesis, we also found DELs involved in other biological processes, such as plant hormone signal transduction (ko04075), plant\u2013pathogen interactions (ko04626), and MAPK signaling pathway (ko04016) (Fig.\u00a05). It is supported by the previous conclusions [34]. For example, in apples, the lncRNA MdLNC610 positively regulates high light-induced anthocyanin accumulation by modulating the expression of MdACO1 and inducing ethylene\nproduction [21]. This is also consistent with kiwifruits in response to Psa infection [36]. The related transgenic evidence was reported in Chinese cabbage, and when a long noncoding natural antisense transcript of the MAPK gene (MSTRG.19915) was silenced, the resistance to downy mildew was enhanced [12]."

Among them, the concentrations of three gingerol analogs, [8]-shogaol, [10]-gingerol, and [12]-shogaol, accumulated significantly. Moreover, the expression levels of 11 gingerol biosynthesis enzyme genes and 190 transcription factor (TF) genes were highly correlated with the content of the three gingerol analogs. Additionally, 16,346 lncRNAs were identified, of which 2,513, 1,225, and 2,884 were differentially expressed in the three comparisons, respectively. Noticeably, DE lncRNAs, such as ZoLNC_008531, ZoLNC_008529, and ZoLNC_007353, might contribute to gingerol biosynthesis by controlling the key enzyme genes or TF transcripts via a cis-acting or trans-acting model. Overall, our results not only provide novel insight into gingerol metabolism, but also lay a foundation for future in-depth studies of the related molecular mechanism."

For metabolomics and transcriptomic analyses, ginger plants were randomly harvested after 180 d of growth (Fig.\u00a0 1A) [1, 2]. Three biological replicates of each cultivar were collected, and each replicate consisted of pooled five mature rhizomes of each ginger cultivar. After rinsing with Milli-Q water, the rhizomes were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u00a0\u00b0C until subsequent analyses.\nMetabolite extraction and\u00a0ultra\u2011performance liquid chromatography\u2011electrospray ionization tandem triple quadrupole/mass spectrometry analysis Sample preparation and extraction were performed according to the methods described by Metware Biotechnology Co., Ltd.

For metabolite extraction, the samples were first desiccated using vacuum freeze-drying. The dried samples were then crushed into a powder using a mixer mill (MM 400, Retsch) at 30\u00a0Hz for 1.5\u00a0min. One hundred milligrams of powder were dissolved in 1.2\u00a0 mL of 70% aqueous methanol.

            "text": "It has been reported that lncRNAs participate in the regulation of target gene expression mainly via cis-acting\nregulation (genes in close genomic proximity) or transacting regulation (genes with long distances and similar expression patterns) [27]. Thus, these DEPCGs within 100 kb upstream or downstream of the DELs were screened as cis-targets. Moreover, the protein-coding genes were identified as the trans-targets of DELs based on the correlation coefficient in expression levels between DELs and DEPCGs, with a p-value < 0.01 [28].\nFunctional enrichment analyses of DELs were performed by Gene Ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses [28, 43]. The GO ontologies were assigned using Blast2GO [28]. Among them, the GO terms (adjusted p-values < 0.05) were identified as significantly enriched [11]. Additionally, to understand the main pathways of DELs involved, the targets of DELs were mapped to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG, www. kegg. jp/ kegg/ kegg1. html), and enrichment analysis was conducted using KOBAS 2.0 (https:// www. biost ars. org/p/ 200126/) [43]. Significantly enriched pathways were considered when p-values < 0.05 [14]."
