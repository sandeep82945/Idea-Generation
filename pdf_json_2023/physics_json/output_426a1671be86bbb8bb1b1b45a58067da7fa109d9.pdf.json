This deciency is evident considering the predicted lifetimes of interstellar PAHs of a few 108 years limited through their destruction by shock waves and galactic cosmic rays,16,29\u201332 while the time scale for the injection of new PAHs from circumstellar envelopes to the interstellar medium exceeds some 109 years.32 This controversy suggests PAHs should not exist in extraterrestrial environments and in meteorites, thus implying that our knowledge on the underlying formation mechanisms to even the simplest representatives of PAHs \u2013 the 10p H\u00fcckel aromatic naphthalene (C10H8) molecule \u2013 in carbon rich circumstellar envelopes is still in its infancy.\nHansen and coworkers investigated molecular-growth pathways in propyne-doped low-pressure premixed ames of benzene and toluene and suggested that benzyl \u00f0C7H 7\u00de radicals contribute to naphthalene formation through reactions with propargyl \u00f0C3H 3\u00de radical along with the involvement of phenylsubstituted butadienyl and vinylacetylene isomers.33 The kinetics and mechanisms of the recombination reaction between benzyl \u00f0C7H 7\u00de and propargyl \u00f0C3H 3\u00de radicals have been theoretically studied by utilizing the B3LYP, CBS-QB3, and CASPT2 quantum chemical methods, as well as the steady-state unimolecular master equation analysis based on the Rice\u2013 Ramsperger\u2013Kassel\u2013Marcus theory.34 Here, we report on the results of molecular beams experiments combined with electronic structure calculations along with computational uid dynamics (CFD) and kinetic modeling of the reaction between the resonantly stabilized benzyl \u00f0C7H 7\u00de and the propargyl \u00f0C3H 3\u00de radicals.

            "text": "With the detection of hydrocarbon molecules of the molecular formula C10H10 and C10H8, it is our objective to elucidate the nature of the structural isomer(s) formed in the reaction of the benzyl with the propargyl radicals. A detailed analysis of the corresponding photoionization efficiency (PIE) curves for ions from m/z = 128 (C10H8 +) to 130 (C10H10 +) allows an elucidation of the structural isomers formed in the reaction. This PIE curve reports the intensity of a well-dened m/z ratio as a function of the photon energy from 7.90 to 10.0 eV (Fig. 3). The experimentally derived PIE curve atm/z = 128 (red) can be reproduced effectively by the reference PIE curve of naphthalene (C10H8, blue) at the highest temperature of 1473 K.40 The PIE curves of m/z = 129 (cyan) and m/z = 128 (red) are superimposable aer scaling suggesting that ions at m/z = 129 at 1473 K are associated with 13C-naphthalene (13CC9H8\n+), being congruent with our discussion about the composition of m/z = 129 above. Hence, we conclude that within our error limits, naphthalene (C10H8) denotes the only contribution to signal at m/z = 128. An elucidation of the structural isomers at m/z = 130 (Fig. S1\u2020) is tricky since no experimental PIE curves exist for any C10H10 isomer. Therefore, these are provided via electronic structure calculations (ESI; Fig. S2 and S3\u2020). However, the evaluated adiabatic IE of 1,2-dihydronaphthalene has been reported as 8.0 eV,41 which does not match the onset of the experimental PIE curve at m/z = 130 at 8.95 \u00b1 0.05 eV. Hence, 1,2-dihydronaphthalene is not formed in the reaction. Altogether, the analysis of the PIE curves at m/z = 128 and 130 reveals the formation of naphthalene and possibly to a minor extent benzofulvene (C10H8; 128 amu) as well as 3-butynylbenzene (HCCCH2CH2C6H5; C10H10; 130 amu).\nReaction mechanisms \u2013 formation of methyleneindanyl radicals\nThe C10H10 potential energy surface (PES) accessed by the benzyl\u2013propargyl radical reaction has been described in detail in previous publications;34,42 here we focus on the channels which are relevant to the experimental conditions of the present study and to conditions in high temperature circumstellar envelopes (Fig. 4a, b, 5, S2\u2013S5 and Table S1\u2020). The resonance stabilized propargyl radical \u00f0C3H 3\u00de can recombine barrierlessly with its radical center located at the methylenic (CH2) or acetylenic (CH) moiety with the benzyl radical \u00f0C7H 7\u00de (Fig. 4a) forming intermediates i1 (3-butynylbenzene, C10H10) and i2 (2,3-butadienylbenzene, C10H10), respectively; these are stabilized by 283 and 287 kJ mol\u22121 with respect to the separated reactants. The subsequent reaction mechanism features a closure of the vemembered ring involving the newly added C3H3 moiety producing various methylene-indane isomers (i3\u2013i5; i7\u2013i9), followed by hydrogen atom migrations conserving the same methylene-indane skeleton, and completed by an atomic hydrogen loss leading to isomers of the methylene-indanyl radical (p3\u2013p5). In particular, i2 undergoes ring closure to 1- methylene-indane i3; the latter can eliminate atomic hydrogen forming the 1-methylene-2-indanyl p4 product via a low exit barrier of only 6 kJ mol\u22121 above the products with the overall\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nreaction exoergicity of 70 kJ mol\u22121. Alternatively, hydrogen atom shis in i3 can lead to i4 or i5 via barriers which are higher than that for the hydrogen atom loss. In turn, i4 can decompose without exit barriers to p4 and also to 3-methylene-1-indanyl p5. The i5 intermediate can dissociate via hydrogen atom loss to p5 without an exit barrier and may also eliminate a molecular hydrogen producing benzofulvene (1-methylene-1H-indene) p1 via a tight exit transition state. Although these products are thermodynamically favored compared to the hydrogen atom loss products p4/p5, the molecular hydrogen loss is not competitive with the atomic hydrogen loss pathways according to the kinetics calculations (Fig. S4\u2020). The ve-membered ring closure in the initial complex i1 has to be preceded by a shi of the C3H3 moiety to the ortho carbon atom in the ring, i1/ i6; in principle, i6 can be also accessed by the addition of propargyl by its CH end to the ortho carbon of benzyl. Next, the ve-membered ring closure in i6 results in 2-methylene-indane i7. A facile 1,2-H migration in i7 from the edge connecting the six- and vemembered rings to the neighboring CH group in the vemembered ring requires a barrier of only 25 kJ mol\u22121 and produces a low-lying C2v symmetric isomer i8. The latter can eliminate one of four symmetric hydrogen atoms from CH2 groups in the ve-membered ring forming 2-methylene-1indanyl p3 without an exit barrier; alternatively, a molecular hydrogen loss leading to 2-benzofulvene (2-methylene-2Hindene) p2 via a tight transition state and high transition state was computed; again, this channel is not competitive with the hydrogen atom loss. Two other hydrogen atom shis in i7 can lead to i9 and i10, but they feature higher barriers as compared to the one for i7/ i8. The i9 and i10 isomers are also connected via a hydrogen atom migration; both of them can split a hydrogen atom forming p3 without exit barriers. In summary, themost favorable exit channels of the benzyl\u2013propargyl reaction\nChem. Sci., 2023, 14, 5369\u20135378 | 5373\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

These lead to the formation of methyleneindanyl radicals, which are precursors of benzofulvene and naphthalene as discussed in the following paragraph.\nThe total and individual product channel reaction rate constants computed at the pressure of 30 torr representative of the hot reactive zone in the micro reactor are illustrated in Fig. S4a.\u202036,43 At lower temperatures, the radical recombination is followed by collisional stabilization of i1 and i2, which is preferable up to 1500 K. According to the computed rate constants for the unimolecular decomposition of these two C10H10 isomers, their lifetime in the 1375\u20131500 K range is on the order of 2\u201319 ms, and the prevailing decomposition channels lead back to the reactants. Since the computed adiabatic ionization energy (IE) of 3-butynylbenzene i1, of 8.8 \u00b1 0.1 eV, reveals a good match with the experimental onset of the PIE curve of m/z = 130 of close to 8.9 eV (Fig. S1\u2020), a sufficient fraction of i1 survives long enough to exit the micro reactor. On the other hand, 2,3-butadienylbenzene i2 has a much lower computed IE of 8.4 \u00b1 0.1 eV. The computational method employed here for the determination of the IEs typically underestimates the experiment by about 0.1 eV, e.g. the computed values for phenylacetylene and naphthalene are 8.68 and 8.01 eV versus the NIST evaluated values of 8.82 and 8.14 eV, respectively;44 therefore, it is unlikely that i2 contributes to the experimental PIE curve for m/z = 130 (Fig. S1\u2020). The computationally predicted relative yield of i2 is signicantly lower than that of i1 under the reactor conditions and hence, the amount of i2 molecules that survive to exit the reactor was insufficient for their detection. At higher temperatures, the endoergic products 1-phenyl-2-butyn-4-yl (C6H5CH2CCCH2) plus atomic hydrogen (p6) and phenyl (C6H5) plus 1,3- butadien-2-yl (i-C4H5) (p7) take over and become dominant; but their formation does not open any pathways toward naphthalene. On the other hand, the yield of 1-methylene-2-indanyl p4 maximizes in the 1250\u20131750 K temperature range, where the rate constant for its production reaches 6\u20137 \u00d7 10\u221214 cm3 molecule\u22121 s\u22121 (Fig. S4\u2020). In the same temperature interval, the rate constants to form alternative methylene-indanyl radicals p3 and p5 also reach their maximal values of about 9 \u00d7 10\u221215 and 3 \u00d7 10\u221215 cm3 molecule\u22121 s\u22121, respectively, but they are appreciably lower than that for the formation of p4. It should be also noted that the rate constants to form benzofulvene isomers p1 and p2 along with molecular hydrogen are more than two orders of magnitude lower than that for the atomic hydrogen loss exit channel forming p4. While the pathway toward naphthalene plus molecular hydrogen also exists in the primary reaction, the calculated rate constant is on the order of 10\u221217 cm3 molecule\u22121 s\u22121 in the relevant temperature range. Below we seek to answer, how then can the experimentally detected naphthalene isomer be formed in the microreactor?\nReaction mechanism \u2013 reaction of methyleneindanyl radicals to benzofulvene and naphthalene\nPrevious calculations of the C10H9 PES rmly established the methylene-indanyl radicals as critical precursors of\n5374 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 5369\u20135378\nbenzofulvenes (p1, p2) and naphthalene (p0) (Fig. 4b) at elevated temperatures.45 Here, we briey highlight the results by discussing the most signicant reaction pathways as compiled in Fig. 4b. 1-Methylene-2-indanyl p4 can decompose via atomic hydrogen loss to benzofulvene p1 via a barrier of 178 kJ mol\u22121 or undergoes a 1,2-H shi forming 3-methylene-1-indanyl p5 via a 156 kJ mol\u22121 barrier. The latter can also dissociate to p1 via atomic hydrogen loss or isomerize to naphthalene (p0) via a multistep isomerization sequence involving one additional hydrogen atom migration to the ipso position, i6 / i11, insertion of the methylene group into the C\u2013C bond in the vemembered ring leading to the ring expansion, i11 / i12 / i13, and hydrogen atom loss from i13 producing naphthalene p0. The highest barrier on the naphthalene formation pathway is 172 kJ mol\u22121 relative to p4, which is slightly lower than that for the formation of benzofulvene. However, p1 is produced both from p4 and p5 via relatively loose hydrogen atom loss transition states; hence, this channel is preferable from the point of view of entropy. The preference for the formation of p1 over p0 in unimolecular decomposition of p4 is displayed in the rate constants for these product channels illustrated in Fig. S4c.\u2020 The RRKM\u2013ME rate constant calculations take into account both barrier heights and entropies of activation and the multistep character of the p4/ p0 + H pathway as compared to the direct p4 / p1 + H dissociation. In particular, at 1000 and 1250 K, the computed p4/ p1 + H rate constant is respectively, factors of 5.9 and 4.6 higher than that for p4 / p0 + H. 2- Methylene-1-indanyl p3 can dissociate only to the high-lying 2- benzofulvene p2 plus atomic hydrogen without an exit barrier, but with a high energy demand of 267 kJ mol\u22121. The alternative pathway to p0 plus atomic hydrogen involves a hydrogen atom shi to the ipso position, p3 / i15, followed by a facile CH2 insertion into the ve-membered ring, i15 / i12 / i13, and subsequent atomic hydrogen elimination.\nThe calculated rate constants for decomposition of the methylene-indanyl radicals (p3\u2013p5) to benzofulvene and naphthalene are illustrated in Fig. S4c.\u2020 The rate constants are high at temperatures above 1000 K. For instance, for p4 \u2013 the main product of the primary benzyl\u2013propargyl radical reaction \u2013 the values at 1250 K reach 1.7 \u00d7 105 and 7.7 \u00d7 105 s\u22121 for the p0 plus atomic hydrogen and p1 plus atomic hydrogen channels, respectively, corresponding to the lifetime of about 1 ms. Moreover, at higher temperatures, the calculations predict p4 not to exist as a chemical species but to merge/equilibrate with p0/p1 plus atomic hydrogen on the time scale which is faster than its collisional relaxation. Thus, at our higher experimental temperatures, p4 is expected to rapidly dissociate to p1 plus atomic hydrogen which is corroborated by the signicant reduction in them/z = 129 signal with the temperature increase (Fig. 2) accompanied with a growth of the m/z = 128 signal. The p5 species decomposes faster and is less thermally stable than p4, whereas p3 is more stable. The latter can survive up to 1650 K but the calculated p3 / p0 plus atomic hydrogen rate constant at 1500 K for its prevailing dissociation channel to naphthalene (p0), 3.5 \u00d7 105 s\u22121, corresponds to the lifetime of only about 3 ms.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

The isomerization rate constant is known to be high, 4 \u00d7 10\u221211 cm3 molecule\u22121 s\u22121, in the relevant temperature range (Fig. S4d\u2020).45 While naphthalene (p0) has been clearly observed experimentally, the unequivocal identication of benzofulvene is impossible due to the unavailability of its measured PIE; this species is unstable under normal conditions. The fact that the calculated IE of benzofulvene (p1), 7.97 eV, is very close to that of naphthalene (p0), 8.01 eV, prohibits any distinction between the two isomers solely based on the onset of the experimental PIE curve. 2-Benzofulvene (p2) can be clearly ruled out since its calculated IE is much lower, 7.14 eV, and no ion signal is observed at this range for m/z = 128. To evaluate the naphthalene (p0)/ benzofulvene (p1) branching ratio under the experimental conditions and to assess the role of the hydrogen assisted isomerization between them, we carried out computational uid dynamics (CFD) and kinetic modeling of the processes in our microreactor (ESI\u2020). According to the results (Fig. 5), at the exit of the reactor, the relative yield of naphthalene constitutes 62% of the total C10H8 yield. The contribution of the hydrogen-assisted isomerization is signicant. When the hydrogen assisted isomerization (p1 + H / p0 + H) is intentionally excluded from the kinetic model, the nal yield of naphthalene drops to only 14% of the total. Thus, the CFD and kinetic modeling conrms that naphthalene (p0) is the prevalent C10H8 isomer observed experimentally, but it forms mostly via benzofulvene (p1) and the contribution of the latter to the observed PIE curve at m/z = 128 cannot be discounted. Overall, we can conclude that the fast secondary decomposition of methylene-indanyl radicals (C10H9) is predicted to be responsible for the formation of benzofulvene (p1) and naphthalene (p0) via the following (simplied) reaction mechanism including the hydrogen assisted isomerization of benzofulvene (p1):\nC7H7 + C3H3 / C10H9 (p3 + p4 + p5) + H (1)\nC10H9 (p3 + p4 + p5) / C10H8 (p0) + H (2)\nC10H9 (p3 + p4 + p5) / C10H8 (p1) + H (3)\nC10H8 (p1) + H / C10H8 (p0) + H (4)\nReaction mechanism \u2013 circumstellar envelopes and cold molecular clouds\nLet us now consider the reaction kinetics under conditions of circumstellar envelopes, i.e., at high temperatures and low pressures. Fig. S4b\u2020 illustrates the reaction rate constants for the benzyl\u2013propargyl process computed in the limit of low pressure, but considering infrared radiative stabilization of the C10H10 intermediates (ESI\u2020). One can see that in this case, stabilization of i2 is no longer signicant, whereas stabilization of i1 prevails only up to 600 K. Above 600 K and up to 1400 K, p4\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nis the main product with its rate constant being in the range of 2 \u00d7 10\u221212 to 1 \u00d7 10\u221213 cm3 molecule\u22121 s\u22121, more than an order of magnitude higher than its values at 30 torr. Clearly, the reduction of pressure strongly favors the production of 1-methylene2-indanyl p4, which is a critical precursor of benzofulvene (p1)/ naphthalene (p0) at high temperatures. Even though the yield of the endoergic p6 and p7 products exceeds that of p4 above 1400 K, the benzyl plus propargyl rate constant to p4 plus atomic hydrogen does not fall below 10\u221214 cm3 molecule\u22121 s\u22121 up to 2000 K. Thus, the reaction mechanism is applicable to the conditions of circumstellar envelopes of carbon rich stars with lower pressures stimulating the higher yield of the C10H8 isomers. In contrast, the benzyl\u2013propargyl reaction is predicted\nChem. Sci., 2023, 14, 5369\u20135378 | 5375\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle . P\nub lis\nhe d\non 1\n9 A\npr il\n20 23\n.

The rate constants computed in the 70\u2013200 K range are illustrated in Fig. S5 (ESI).\u2020 While the total rate constant rises above 10\u221210 cm3 molecule\u22121 s\u22121 at low temperatures, the reaction nearly exclusively forms C10H10 (i1) via radiative stabilization. A small fraction of p4 is produced with the rate constant on the order of 10\u221214 cm3 molecule\u22121 s\u22121, however, at such low temperatures, the 1-methylene-2-indanyl radical (p4) does not possess sufficient energy to decompose via atomic hydrogen loss. The rate constants for the production of benzofulvene (p1) and naphthalene (p0) along with molecular hydrogen in the primary reaction are evaluated to be as low as 10\u221217 and \u223c10\u221219 cm3 molecule\u22121 s\u22121, respectively, and hence can be neglected. Therefore, despite being classied as a radical\u2013radical reaction, bimolecular reactions between the propargyl and the benzyl radicals are closed in cold molecular clouds, and radiative stabilization of the initial collision complex may control the outcome of the reaction, whereas in circumstellar envelopes, naphthalene (p0) along with minor fractions of benzofulvene (p1) can be formed via a complex sequence of chemical reactions (1) to (4)."

Each PAH carrying a benzyl moiety in conjunction with a nonsubstituted carbon atom at the ortho position of the methylene group \u00f0 CH 2\u00demay undergo ring annulation upon reaction with the propargyl radical (Fig. 6). In strong analogy of the benzyl\u2013propargyl system leading via benzannulation through hydrogen assisted isomerization to the simplest PAH carrying two six-membered rings, i.e. naphthalene (C10H8), reactions of 1\u2032- and 2\u2032-methylnaphthyl \u00f0C10H7CH 2\u00de with propargyl may eventually access anthracene and phenanthrene (C14H10), which carry three six-membered rings. In deep space, 1\u2032- and 2\u2032- methylnaphthyl \u00f0C10H7CH 2\u00de can be generated easily via photodissociation of 1- and 2-methylnaphthalene (C10H7CH3), respectively, which in turn can be formed via the barrierless reactions of tolyl radicals (C6H4$CH3) with vinylacetylene (C4H4) as demonstrated recently in crossed molecular beams experiments.46,47 Further molecular mass growth processes commence with the photolysis and carbon\u2013hydrogen bond cleavage within the methyl group of distinct isomers of methylated phenanthrenes and anthracenes; upon reaction with the propargyl radicals and eventual molecular hydrogen loss, ve distinct C18H12 isomers including the simplest representatives of helicenes ([4]helicene), acenes (tetracene), and phenacenes ([4] phenacene) can be synthesized in deep space via entrancebarrierless, exoergic bimolecular reactions involving the propargyl radical (Fig. 5). Therefore, this novel reaction mechanism, which we designate Propargyl Addition\u2013BenzAnnulation (PABA), may represent a critical sink of interstellar propargyl\n5376 | Chem.
