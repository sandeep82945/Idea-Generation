    "abstractText": "We have developed a highly sensitive promoter trap vector system using transposons to generate reporter cells with high efficiency. Using an EGFP/luciferase reporter cell clone responsive to forskolin, which is thought to activate adenylate cyclase, isolated from human chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line K562, we found several compounds unexpectedly caused reporter responses. These included tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as dasatinib and cerdulatinib, which were seemingly unrelated to the forskolin-reactive pathway. To investigate whether any other clones of forskolinresponsive cells would show the same response, nine additional forskolin-responsive clones, each with a unique integration site, were generated and quantitatively evaluated by luciferase assay. The results showed that each clone represented different response patterns to the reactive compounds. Also, it became clear that each of the reactive compounds could be profiled as a unique pattern by the 10 reporter clones. When other TKIs, mainly bcr-abl inhibitors, were evaluated using a more focused set of five reporter clones, they also showed unique profiling. Among them, dasatinib and bosutinib, and imatinib and bafetinib showed homologous profiling. The tyrosine kinase inhibitors mentioned above are approved as anticancer agents, and the system could be used for similarity evaluation, efficacy prediction, etc., in the development of new anticancer agents.",

This promoter trap system efficiently produces reporter cells expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and firefly-luciferase (Fluc) as reporter genes in response to arbitrary conditions and is sufficiently sensitive to amplify and detect changes of the promoter activity in response to a reactant, even with limited endogenous gene induction [1,3]. Using this system, we produced reporter cells that respond to the expression of the c-Myc gene [1], endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stresses [1], glucocorticoids [3], or vitamin A/D [4]. Although identifying the responding gene in the reporter cell is not always necessary, once identified, an unexpected gene is occasionally found as a novel marker. For example, OSBPL9 was identified as a novel ERstress-responsive gene but was overlooked in public data because of the low score [1].

            "text": "To determine which genes the trap vectors were inserted into and affected under the control of expression, we analyzed the vector insertion site of the genome by sequencing the DNA band of the splinkerette PCR (Figures S2 and S6) or the transcripts fused to the reporter gene (GAL4FF) by 5\u2032RACE (Figures S7 and S8). As a result, we succeeded in identifying response genes (Table 1). MALRD1 (also known as DIET1) encodes a conserved protein characterized by multiple MAM (Meplin-A5-protein tyrosine phosphatase \u00b5) and LDLR A2 (low-density lipoprotein receptor A2) domains [14]. CXCL3 gene encodes a member of the CXC subfamily of chemokines, and this protein is a secreted growth factor that signals through the G protein-coupled receptor, CXC receptor 2 [15,16]. CXCL3 is an autocrine ligand for CXCR2, and the signaling pathway originating from CXCR2 activates PPAR\u03b3 to activate CXCL3 transcription [17]. Since PPAR\u03b3 expression is activated by forskolin stimulation [18], CXCL3 could be induced by forskolin stimulation. LGALS1 gene encodes Gal1, one of 15 members of a family of \u03b2-galactoside-binding proteins called galectins, which are described to function as homodimeric proteins consisting of 14.5 kDa subunits. Gal1 expression is regulated via the luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor (LHCGR), a common receptor for LH and hCG [19]. Interestingly, hCG stimulation in hGL5 cells stimulated intracellular accumulation of cAMP in hGL5 cells [20]. So, if some feedback exists, there may be a common mechanism for responding to forskolin. To examine whether the endogenous genes also respond to forskolin in the same manner as a reporter, we evaluated their mRNA expression by real-time PCR. The expression of all identified genes was upregulated by the addition of forskolin (Figure 7). Since the fold change is less than twofold for any of the identified genes, the amplification mechanism by the GAL4-UAS system in the reporter cells seem to be essential for detection of response and reliable quantitative analyses.

For the calcitriol-responsive cells mentioned above, the TSKU gene was identified as a responsive gene that had multiple RARE and VDRE sequences where nuclear receptors for vitamins A and D, respectively, can bind. This may be the reason why multiple vitamin compounds react in these cells. Conversely, dasatinib has not been reported to bind to nuclear receptors but is a potent inhibitor of BCR-ABL and is a standard drug of choice for molecular targeted therapy for malignant tumors. Reporter cells were significantly less responsive to imatinib and nilotinib (Figure 6c), which are standard BCR-ABL inhibitors, suggesting that a pathway different from the BCR-ABL pathway is involved in responsiveness. Dasatinib is not a selective BCR-ABL inhibitor but a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, e.g., EGFR, EPHA2, EPHB1, BTK, MAP3K4, MAP3K14, DDR1, GAK, etc. [21,22]. Similarly, imatinib and nilotinib also target proteins beyond BCR-ABL, each with specific differences compared to dasatinib. Notably, they are known to commonly bind and inhibit the non-kinase target NQO2 [23]. Thus, it is likely that there are multiple pathways in common with the forskolin response pathway that are different from BCR-ABL pathway. When trying to directly generate dasatinib- or imatinib-responsive cells, reporter cells could not be generated without the prior generation of dasatinib- or imatinib-resistant cells. Our procedure for generating reporter cells is disadvantaged by requiring that clones cannot be selected unless they are stimulated at least once, and therefore the cells must survive the stimulation and reversibly return to a steady state. If the cells\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 13863 9 of 14\nare addicted to BCR-ABL, they will probably not survive in the presence of its inhibitors unless the stimulation and concentration conditions are appropriate. Even if dasatinibor imatinib-resistant cells are created, the cells may not respond to them depending on the resistance mechanism involved. However, this study found that another stimulus can be substituted when producing dasatinib- or imatinib-responsive cells, providing a way around this problem. Comprehensive analysis could discover cells that report a drug that inevitably cannot produce reporter cells. Therefore, it is highly valuable to continue to generate and pool randomly obtained reporter cells that are unconstrained by existing models. As promoter trapping is almost random (although some bias toward transcriptionally active regions has been recognized [24]), it would be better if the stimuli for producing reporter cells were also random. Furthermore, if the goal is to obtain multiple reporter cells, no matter what the reaction is, a single stimulus to produce responsive cells is not needed. For example, a mixture of serum, culture supernatant (conditioned medium), or other biological liquid samples could be used as a stimulant. This conceptual methodology has the potential to save a significant amount of time and cost compared with carefully handling each single stimulus, and can find undiscovered bioactive substances. The luciferase assay data were obtained with high sensitivity and accuracy. It would be impossible to obtain data from microarrays with the same level of detection. In realtime PCR analysis, the fold change value for forskolin-induced mRNA level was smaller than 2 for every responsive endogenous gene (Figure 7). Reporter cells obtained by the promoter trap method express the reporter gene via the GAL4-UAS system [5,6,25] and can thus respond to stimuli with extreme sensitivity. This is the greatest advantage of this evaluation system. Since a cellular organism is used as a detector, this can be termed as a highly sensitive bioanalyzer system. For simplicity, we limited the profiling to a single concentration condition, but we believe that dose analysis will further deepen our understanding of the drug\u2019s properties. In fact, analysis of the 5 response clones at 2 concentrations of dasatinib showed difference in response depending on the dose, especially for #F2 (Figure S9). Although new ideas for data processing still need to be developed, the use of such dose dependency for profiling in the future will make it an even more reliable analytical tool."

Immediately after electroporation, all the cells were suspended in media, centrifuged, resuspended, and then spread onto a 12-well plate in 1 mL culture medium. After cell propagation, the EGFP-positive population (considered to express EGFP constitutively) was removed by three to four rounds of cell sorting using SH800Z cell sorter (Sony, Tokyo, Japan). Sorted cells were then propagated on a 10 cm dish scale and were stimulated with 10 \u00b5M forskolin overnight at 37 \u25e6C in a CO2 incubator; subsequently, high EGFP-expressing cells were single-cell sorted into 96-well plates.
