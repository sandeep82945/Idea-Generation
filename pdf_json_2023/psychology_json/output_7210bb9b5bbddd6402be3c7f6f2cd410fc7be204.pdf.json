            "text": "Colloidal metal nanopartciles (NPs) have vast appeal as candidates in applications such as catalysis,1 plasmonics,2 imaging,3 electronics,4 sensing,5 photonics,6 medicine,7 and as building blocks for nanoscale devices.8 Controlling their shape is critical to tailoring their physicochemical properties and influencing performance, since the shape of a nanoparticle determines which crystal facets are exposed at its surface.9\u201311 Additionally, surface composition plays an essential role in defining properties,12 as element intermixing controls the details of active sites, electron donor/acceptor effects, interfacial properties, and the occurrence of surface defects.13,14 Overall, control of shape and composition are vital to optimizing performance.15\nAmong the shapes reported for colloidal metal nanoparticles, branched morphologies,16 such as nanopods17 and nanodendrites,18 have attracted interest. This is because while the catalytic activity of pseudospherical NPs has been linked to their high surface-area-to-volume ratios, this ratio is enhanced by branching.9 This exposes more surface active sites19 and allows the use of lower catalyst loadings.20 However, branched\nnanostructures have high surface energies and thermodynamically convert to pseudospheres or near-pseudospherical polyhedra by the migration of adatoms to exposed low energy facets.21 Additionally, many NP catalysts are based on noble metals, whose face-centered cubic (fcc) structures disfavour anisotropic growth.22\nThe syntheses of branched NPs for transition metals, including Pt,23 Ni,24 Co,25 Pd,21 Ag,26 Au,27 and advances in making individually bimetallic alloys,17,28\u201332 have been reported. In particular, for nanopods, external factors encourage kinetic NP growth, whereby high-energy facets evolve faster than low-energy facets, yielding branched nanoparticles.16 These external factors can include capping agents and mixtures thereof that selectively cap specific facets,33\u201336 or temperature and precursor concentration that encourage growth in the kinetic regime.20,37 Two theories have been developed to explain branching; atomic deposition38 and oriented attachment.39 In the first, atoms continuously add to high energy NP facets, with branching seen when the deposition rate exceeds that of the subsequent migration of these adatoms to lower energy facets.16 In the second, nanocrystallites coalesce before reorienting to co-align their crystallographic orientations.40 (Methods like selective etching33,41 and template-directed growth42 have been investigated, but bring cost and complexity.)

In turn, this is important because compositional changes reflect competition between (1) rates of metal atom production, (2) particle seeding, collision and reorientation, and (3) atomic deposition and migration. These effects further feed into the shape and size of the resulting NPs.17,43 It is, therefore, of primary importance \u2013 yet still extremely challenging \u2013 to controllably manipulate both nanopod shape and composition.\nMoving from nanopods to nanodendrites, synthesis has hitherto been essentially empirical, with growth mechanisms eluding full explanation.44\u201347 Simulations of dendrite formation by diffusion-limited aggregation suggest randomly diffusing preformed NPs attach sequentially to a seed particle to evolve a dendrite structure.48\u201350 While this stepwise mechanism is artificial, it is accepted that a similar collision motif can explain randomized nanoobjects, particularly at high NP concentrations.51,52 However, a more rigorous understanding of the growth mechanism(s) promises a unified approach and the targeted design of nanopods and nanodendrites.\nIn this paper, Pt is systematically combined with Fe in onepot processes using routine reagents. Reactions done under a range of conditions yield individually bimetallic nanoparticles whose construction sheds new light on the growth mechanisms operating during nanopod and nanodendrite formation. Initially, the importance of avoiding excess nucleation in the formation of nanopods is highlighted. Thereafter, the fine control of capping agent and reductant addition, metal reagent addition, and temperature is used to manipulate nucleation and growth steps. This enables the controlled variation of morphology and of composition. Finally, the maintenance of a controlled nanopod level in reaction systems underpins the establishment of a collision-based mechanism whereby nanopod arms undergo branching. Control of nanopod levels is then used to predictably and selectively achieve nanodendrites."

            "text": "Varying the type and relative concentration of chemical species such as reducing agent(s) and metal salt(s), as well as changing conditions like temperature, have previously been effective in controlling the shapes of NPs through changes to the overall rate of metal ion reduction.20 However, for heterobimetallic systems any change can alter both morphology and composition.17,43,53 Hitherto, one practical effect of the way Ptbased bimetallics have been targeted was that product for-\nmation was significantly affected by the noble metal\u2019s positive reduction potential and products were therefore Pt-rich or equimolar.17,43,54,55 We reasoned that more effective compositional variations could be achieved by using multiple variables to ensure a thermodynamic reaction pathway (Scheme 1(a)). Changes to composition in bimetallic NPs are generally accompanied by morphological changes.17,30 By logical extension though, understanding the symbiotic relationship between multiple condition changes would offer to maintain morphology while varying composition and vice versa. This should make it possible to obtain low-Pt products and to manipulate either morphology or composition.\nSolution-phase NP synthesis comprises nucleation and growth processes. Though shape and twinning of nuclei can influence final NP morphology,56 the dominant effect is had by growth,10 which is either thermodynamically or kinetically controlling, giving rise to different morphologies. Examples of this, shown in Fig. 1(a)\u2013(d), result from the synthetic approach we adopt here. Specifically, a 1 : 1 metal salt mixture has been treated with the same total volume (to ensure equivalent metal reagent concentrations) of capping agents oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) and a strong reductant. The last is 1,2-hexadecanediol (1,2-HDD). Based on our previous work57,58 and literature on Pt/Fe59,60 and Pt/Ni61,62 systems, these conditions are expected to ensure the smooth generation of Pt0 and Fe0 (see ESI\u2020 for confirmation from PXRD of this in the current work). While doing this, we have tested the symbiotic relationship between parameters that offers a route to modulate the morphological and compositional outcome of the reaction (Scheme 1(b)). Fig. 1(a) shows prototypical (near-)pseudospheres of the type expected from a low flux of reduced metal monomers (relatively low reduction rate) triggering thermodynamic growth (purple region in Fig. 1(e)).

This is either because atomic deposition at high-energy facets now outstrips the migratory aptitude of adatoms to lower energy facets,21 or because nanocrystallites undergo collision and oriented attachment.39 In this regime, pod size and the extent of anisotropy would be influenced by the availability of feedstock in the growth phase. Hence, raising the reduction rate would give more nucleation (Fig. 1(e), green) but leave sufficient feedstock for the kinetic growth of larger particles. However, continuing to raise the rate (Fig. 1(e), yellow) would cause extensive nucleation and a truncated kinetic growth phase. These scenarios are illustrated in Fig. 1(b) and (c), respectively. Finally, the most strongly reducing conditions would cause reversion to the thermodynamic regime (Fig. 1(e), red) and near-pseudospheres (Fig. 1(d)), with particle growth at all facets or with sufficient thermal energy to migrate surface atoms to lower energy facets. These arguments guided our initial attempts to systematically contrive the growth of anisotropic Pt/Fe NPs."

            "heading": "The role of capping agents",
            "text": "Steric capping agents are fundamental controllers of NP development, and combining alkylamines with carboxylic acids and/or phosphines and thiols offers fine-control over products.63 This work utilizes the fact that OA and OAm capping agents both combine to induce a range of product morphologies,64 and that they can offer multifunctionality. OA generally acts as a facet-indiscriminate capping agent,65 and increasing its contribution induces only a transition away from anisotropic growth and the agglomeration of pseudospheres.43,57 In contrast, OAm is established as acting as a facet-selective capping agent65 and reductant.58,63,66 Harnessing this promises an additional level of fine-control over the reducing power available in our systems, and this is investigated in Fig. 1(a)\u2013(d) (see ESI, Fig. S1\u2020).\u2021 Data show the results of initial experiments where equimolar Pt:Fe mixtures were treated with 1,2-HDD at 250 \u00b0C, with increases in the proportion of OAm relative to OA (maintaining a 2 mL total volume of the two to ensure constant initial metal reagent concentrations in each experiment) gradually rendering the system more strongly reducing. Fig. 1(a) shows small pseudospherical seeds made with 1 : 1 OA : OAm, suggesting a modest reduction rate (Fig. 1(e), purple). Increasing the proportion of OAm gives nanopods, with arm formation giving larger particles on account of an initial nucleation event that leaves sufficient feedstock for subsequent kinetic anisotropic growth (Fig. 1(b), green; compare 4.7 \u00b1 1.1 nm vs. 8.6 \u00b1 1.6 nm in Fig. S2\u2020). More strongly reducing conditions next induce more nucleation that consumes potential feedstock for growth and yields smaller nanopods (Fig. 1(c), yellow; 4.3 \u00b1 0.8 nm in\nFig. S2\u2020). This situation is exacerbated if the rate (proportion of OAm) is further increased, with rapid reduction now causing extensive nucleation and inhibiting anisotropic growth (Fig. 1(d); 3.5 \u00b1 0.6 nm in Fig. S2\u2020). A closer inspection of this high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) figure reveals that alongside the small, brightly contrasting particles, large and less clearly contrasting pseudospheres have formed (examples circled red, see below). Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) maps of the 0.8 : 1.2 and 0 : 2 OA : OAm systems establish that the brighter particles are uniformly intermixed and bimetallic (see Fig. S3 and S4\u2020). Meanwhile, high-resolution (HR) TEM imaging points to anisotropic growth by collision-based oriented attachment; monocrystalline seeds form under strongly reducing conditions whereas nanopods generated under less strongly reducing conditions show randomly oriented lattice fringes attributable to the 111 and 200 planes of fcc PtFe (Fig. S5\u2020).67,68 Data suggest the relatively short reaction time prevents the crystallographic alignment of aggregated seeds.\nMoving to composition, Pt(II) can be more easily reduced than Fe(III), to create Pt-rich bimetallic NPs through a kinetically controlled reaction.69 In this work, we aim to avoid this. From Fig. 1(f ), Pt1Fe1 forms if both metal precursors and capping agents OA and OAm are each used in 1 : 1 ratios. If the proportion of OAm is then increased, product composition can be skewed towards Fe. In particular, for OA : OAm 0.5 : 1.5, the product reveals an Fe contribution of \u223c90 At%. However, when only 2 mL OAm is used (i.e. OA is excluded), this drops to \u223c65 At%. As noted above, this sample also reveals the appearance of pseudospherical NPs. These analyze as Fe-based by STEM EDX (Fig. S4\u2020), suggesting the formation of Fe NPs that oxidize to magnetite.64 While they are not common enough to significantly affect composition in this sample (Fig. S7\u2020), their development alongside truncated nanopods helps explain the depleted Fe-content of the latter relative to the more highly anisotropic nanopods obtained in the 0.5 : 1.5 system. Taken together, these data point to reduction preferentially depleting Pt(II), with any subsequent promotion of reduction by increasing the proportion of OAm favouring the reduction of Fe(III). This increases the Fe contribution in individually bimetallic particles and ultimately yields monometallic Fe NPs. To probe this further, we explored the mechanism operating by varying OA : OAm whilst maintaining a constant level of the former. According to the view above, this should result in Fe content initially increasing as OAm levels are raised, before dropping again in the most reducing systems.\nBased on the results above, the Fe-rich product obtained when OA : OAm = 0.5 : 1.5 (Fig. 1c and Fig. S1(g)\u2013(i)\u2020) was investigated to see how morphology and composition changed when varying OAm (1\u20133 mL) while using constant OA (0.5 mL). Data are presented in Fig. S1, S2 and S8, S9.\u2020 The system in Fig. S8(a)\u2013(c)\u2020 incorporates less OAm (and a lower reduction ability) than that in Fig. S1(g)\u2013(i).\u2020 That the nanopods formed are marginally bigger (4.8 \u00b1 0.9 nm in Fig. S9(a) vs. 4.3 \u00b1 0.8 nm in Fig. S2(c)\u2020) is attributed to volume dictating whether \u2021High-angle annular dark field (HAADF) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) imaging, scanning TEM (STEM) energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis and maps, and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data are available as ESI.\u2020\nThis journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023 Nanoscale, 2023, 15, 8814\u20138824 | 8817\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

That is, while adding more OAm provides additional reductant, dilution of the metal salts offsets this, preventing distinctly larger NPs from forming. However, using yet more OAm, Fig. S8(d)\u2013(f )\u2020 emerge. These contain similarly shaped but larger nanopods (6.4 \u00b1 1.3 nm in Fig. S9(b)\u2020), which suggest the additional OAm now has proportionately less diluting effect (see below) and that the increased reducing ability of more OAm more than offsets the influence of increased volume. The mean compositions for each sample shown in Fig. S8\u2020 reinforce the view established by Fig. 1(f ) and Fig. S1(i),\u2020 that using additional OAm initially raises and then lowers Fe contribution in the bimetallic product. Interestingly, Fig. S8(d)\u2013(l) and S9(b)\u2013(d)\u2020 present similar morphologies, sizes and compositions. Overall, results back-up our view that adding OAm makes the system more reducing and that the first effect of this is to promote Fe(III) reduction and Fe inclusion, with more Pt finally incorporated under only the most reducing conditions. With this in mind, experiments next turned to investigating temperature effects."

Representative imaging is shown in Fig. 2 with corresponding particle size analysis in ESI Fig. S10.\u2020 An OA : OAm ratio of 0.8 : 1.2 at 250 \u00b0C gives the nanopods shown in Fig. 2(b). The same process at 225 \u00b0C retains polycrystalline nanopods (Fig. 2(a) and Fig. S11, S12) though particle size is decreased (5.7 \u00b1 1.5 nm vs. 8.6 \u00b1 1.6 nm, Fig. S10\u2020), while 300 \u00b0C decreases arm number and nanopod size to 6.4 \u00b1 1.2 nm (Fig. 2(c) and Fig. S10, S11\u2020). This is attributed to the reduction rate being greatly increased at higher temperature. As mentioned before, in this regime nucleation outstrips particle growth.\nNPs in Fig. 2(d)\u2013(f ) are produced using the same total volume of capping agent as those in Fig. 2(a)\u2013(c), but with a higher proportion of OAm. Hence, nanopods in Fig. 2(e) are smaller than those in Fig. 2(b) (4.3 \u00b1 0.8 nm vs. 8.6 \u00b1 1.6 nm), on account of the higher reducing ability of the former system. Fig. 2(f ) (see also Fig. S13\u2020) reveals similar performance to that in Fig. 2(c) at the higher temperature of 300 \u00b0C. However, looking at lower temperature syntheses, Fig. 2(d) suggests a weaker reducing ability than in Fig. 2(a) even though more OAm is present. This surprising result is reflected too by visual assessment of the samples, where the 0.5 : 1.5/225 \u00b0C sample is less intensely black than the 0.8 : 1.2/225 \u00b0C sample, suggesting a lower yield of NPs. Consistent with this, HAADF-STEM shows only very small particle sizes in this sample (Fig. S13\u2020). These data suggest an effect due to OA that is only evident when the system is not rendered strongly reducing on account of high levels of OAm and/or high temperature and which is therefore only evidenced Fig. 2(a). A possible explanation is furnished by a previous report on the use of mixed OA\u2013OAm systems. In that work, Fe(acac)3 underwent ligand substitution to incorporate the oleate conjugate base of OA (OA\u2032). The resulting complex, Fe(acac)x(OA\u2032)y, was shown to\ninduce extensive nucleation.63 In our work, any such behavior would be most significant in Fig. 2(a), and indeed those product nanopods are very Fe-rich. The same prior art pointed to higher temperatures or the use of a greater proportion of OAm depleting OA through a condensation reaction with the amine to yield weak reductant N-(cis-9-octadecenyl)oleamide.63\nFig. 2(g)\u2013(i) and Fig. S13\u2020 report samples prepared using 0.5 mL OAm more than comparable samples in Fig. 2(d)\u2013(f ). The effect on reducing ability at 225 \u00b0C is clear, with significantly more reduction giving nanopods, though still slightly smaller than those in Fig. 2(a) (4.2 \u00b1 0.8 nm vs. 5.7 \u00b1 1.5 nm). A similar, strongly reducing situation is seen in Fig. 2(h), where nanopods possess either more or more distinct arms and are bigger than those in Fig. 2(e) (6.4 \u00b1 1.3 nm vs. 4.3 \u00b1 0.8 nm, also see Fig. 1(b) and (c)). This effect is even more pronounced at 300 \u00b0C (cf. Fig. 2(f ) and (i), 5.4 \u00b1 0.9 nm vs. 7.2 \u00b1 1.3 nm), suggesting that the higher temperature exacerbates the strongly reducing (OAm-rich) conditions, giving nanopods with increasingly well-defined arms.\nMoving to composition, Fig. 2( j) shows how samples produced using OA : OAm = 0.5 : 1.5 and 0.5 : 2 present similar trends. In these, Pt inclusion increases with temperature, but products contain a lower proportion of Pt at any given temperature for the (less strongly reducing) 0.5 : 1.5 systems. Samples made using OA : OAm = 0.8 : 1.2 present mean compositions similar to the 0.5 : 2 system at 225 and 300 \u00b0C. However, at 250 \u00b0C results are quite different, and suggest that a higher proportion of OA enables a higher Pt composition at rather less than 300 \u00b0C. Overall, these data establish that products with not only specific shapes and sizes, but also desired compositions from low-Pt to approaching equimolar, can be made by manipulating both OA and OAm levels (absolute and relative) as well as temperature. Lastly, the systems in Fig. 2 were used to verify product stability. Data reported in Fig. S15\u2020 show the results of comparable experiments notwithstanding the use of 15 rather than 30 min of heating at either 250 or 300 \u00b0C. The similar morphologies and compositions testify to the nanomaterials prepared here being completely formed in <15 min and undergoing no further alterations. This contrasts with previous work, in which extended heating caused morphological changes.70"

Additional OAm completes this transition, giving the substantial (27.1 \u00b1 4.7 nm) nanodendrites in Fig. 3(c) and Fig. S16(b).\u2020 Adding yet more OAm or raising temperature then causes reversion to nanopod formation. In the case of more OAm, nanopods co-exist with less large nanodendrites (20.3 \u00b1 4.2 nm). Meanwhile, using 300 \u00b0C, only nanopods are seen (Fig. 3(d), (e) and Fig. S16(c)\u2013(e)\u2020).\nMore straightforward than the morphological variations in Fig. 3(a)\u2013(e), the Pt contribution to products obtained using Fe-deficient conditions is increased, including to >50 At%. Overall, the two sets of compositional data in Fig. 3(f ) still show similar trends; increasing reducing strength of the system initially raises Fe contribution to the product, before it finally falls back again (viz. Fig. 1 and Fig. S8\u2020). However, the minimum in Pt contribution is shifted to higher OAm levels in the 2 : 1 Pt : Fe system. This is unsurprising given we now expect increased OAm to mainly promote Fe reduction. Moreover, we revisit an effect seen in Fig. S8,\u2020 where the\nFig. 2 Representative HAADF images of Pt/Fe NPs synthesized at different temperatures using OA : OAm 0.8 : 1.2 (a)\u2013(c), 0.5 : 1.5 (d)\u2013(f ), 0.5 : 2 (g)\u2013 (i); ( j) mean STEM EDX composition of particles shown in (a)\u2013(i).

Again, the offsetting of stronger reducing ability by increased volume is suggested.\nNanodendrites have previously been produced largely empirically.44\u201347 However, these new data suggest a method for doing this predictably, potentially also controlling arm numbers. Current results suggest that making the system more strongly reducing (more OAm, higher temperature) raises the concentration of nanopods, and that this triggers nanodendrite formation (Fig. 3(a) and (b)). Further increasing nanopod concentration using more OAm continues this trend, with Fig. 3(c) showing more complex, larger nanodendrites. However, the continued addition of OAm then reaches a point where increased reducing ability is offset by the diluting influence of increased volume; this explains Fig. 3(d), where both nanopods and nanodendrites are seen. The data in Fig. 3(e) suggest the nanopod concentration is important in dictating whether nanodendrites form. This sample exhibits nanopods even though it should have a higher nanopod concentration due to the higher temperature. Overall, data suggest that moving from low to intermediate nanopod concentrations favours dendrite formation, but that continuing to raise this concentration then causes nanopods to be retained. This suggests the collision-based formation of nanodendrites, with low nanopod concentrations (weakly reducing systems) not exhibiting enough collisions. In very strongly reducing conditions (excess OAm), we speculate that nanopods express a surfactant double layer with OA closest to the particle surface and OAm forming an outer layer, and that this hinders col-\nlisions. The resulting avoidance of agglomeration leads nanopods synthesized in 0.5 : 2.0 OA : OAm at 300 \u00b0C to be highly stable \u2013 resisting separation by centrifugation, and remaining dispersed in hexane for weeks without precipitation. Similar behaviour has been seen for gold NPs in hexane stabilized by OA and OAm.71\nNanopod formation can be ascribed to seeds undergoing rapid atomic deposition or particle collisions. Polycrystallinity in Fig. S3\u2020 suggests the latter in our case, with short reaction times preventing the crystallographic realignment of individual nanocrystallites. HRTEM data obtained for the nanopodal 0.8 : 1.2 OA : OAm system in Fig. 3(a) support this view (Fig. S18\u2020). Meanwhile, similar data for the 0.5 : 2.0 OA : OAm system, extend the idea to uniformly intermixed polycrystalline nanodendrites (Fig. 3(c) and Fig. S20\u2020), before a reversion to polycrystalline nanopods is seen at higher temperature (Fig. 3(e) and Fig. S21\u2020)."

In this concentration range, the arms of some nanopods become branched by virtue of coalescence events that occur following collisions between themselves and other nanopods (Scheme 2).

Elevating the system to the usual reaction temperature would then allow reduction of the remaining feedstock (250 \u00b0C for 30 min, step 2). Three possible outcomes were envisaged depending on the duration of step 1. First, few seeds might form during a short step 1, with there being no or little influence on the consumption of monomer in step 2. This would\nallow sufficient nucleation in this step for nanopods to result. Second, a significant number of seeds could form if step 1 was of intermediate duration. Feedstock depletion would then restrict (or even prevent) nucleation in step 2, limiting nanopod generation and triggering nanodendrite formation. Third, extensive nucleation in an extended step 1 would give a dearth of feedstock for nucleation in step 2, but the nanopod concentration already achieved would be higher than that at which nanodendrites form.\nPt/Fe nanopods and nanodendrites made using 2 : 1 Pt : Fe reagents and a 0.8 : 1.2 OA : OAm volume ratio (total volume 2 mL) were tested and data are shown in Fig. 4(a)\u2013(c) and Fig. S22, S23.\u2020 Microscopy on product obtained if step 1 was omitted (t = 0 min) reveals nanopod formation (Fig. 4(a)). A transition to nanodendrites is seen if step 1 lasted 10 min (Fig. 4(b)) before, in line with expectation, creating a higher concentration of seeds (20 min step 1) led to nanopods again dominating (Fig. 4(c)). While different morphologies are incurred, it is important to look for compositional variations.\nScheme 2 Proposed mechanism for making polycrystalline nanodendrites. Nanopods form initially (left). Subsequent collisions result in branching of the arms in some nanopods, giving nanodendrites (middle). Continued collisions between nanopods and the arms of nanodendrites exhausts the supply of nanopods (right).\nFig. 4 (a)\u2013(c) Representative HAADF images of Pt/Fe NPs made using 2 : 1 Pt : Fe and 0.8 : 1.2 mL OA : OAm at 250 \u00b0C for 30 min after mixing at 200 \u00b0C for 0\u201320 min; (d)\u2013(h) Representative HAADF images of Pt/Ni NPs synthesized using 1 : 1 Pt : Ni and 0.4 : 1.2 mL OA : OAm at 250 \u00b0C for 30 min after mixing at 200 \u00b0C for 0\u201340 min; (i) Pt (At%) as a function of 200 \u00b0C mixing time (step 1) for products in (a)\u2013(h).\nThis journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023 Nanoscale, 2023, 15, 8814\u20138824 | 8821\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

If genuine, this could be attributed to the ease of Fe(III) reduction.\nGiven the ambiguity over whether Pt/Fe composition alters in tests with a 200 \u00b0C mixing step, we undertook a similar study using equimolar Pt(acac)2 and Ni(acac)2 and a 0.4 : 1.2 OA : OAm volume ratio (total volume 1.6 mL). Step 1 (mixing at 200 \u00b0C for 0\u201360 min) preceded an unchanged step 2 (250 \u00b0C for 30 min), with the longer Step 1 offering greater scope to probe for compositional variations as a function of mixing time. Fig. 4(d) and (e) show that nanopods formed with either no or a short 200 \u00b0C step (t = 0, 10 min, also Fig. S24\u2020). Using a 20 min mixing step increases the morphological complexity of the product (Fig. 4(f )), which we attribute to simple nanodendrites (27.8 \u00b1 4.6 nm, Fig. S24 and S25\u2020). In line with expectation, moving to a 40 min mixing step yields the much more substantial (45.0 \u00b1 7.7 nm) dendrites of fcc PtNi seen in\nFig. 4(g) and Fig. S24\u2013S26.\u202067 As now expected, a 60 min step 1 yields nanopods once more (Fig. 4(h) and Fig. S24\u2020). These data plainly suggest a method for the controlled and selective formation of nanopods and nanodendrites in different bimetallic systems. The greater range of mixing times also allows a more confident analysis of composition in Ni/Pt nanopods/dendrites; all samples demonstrate essentially identical compositions (Fig. 4(i)), verifying the ability to modulate morphology but maintain composition."

            "text": "While branched NPs represent an exciting avenue of research into nanomaterials with high surface areas, the empirical nature with which they have often been made has hindered attempts at their systematic production. In addition, the desire to introduce a second metal has added complexity; namely the tendency for a change in composition to promote morphological change, and vice versa. The difficulty of systematically changing just one variable has interfered significantly with applications development.\nHere, the systematic combination of Pt with Fe under a range of conditions yields bimetallic NPs that undergo specific condition-dependent aggregation by a collision-based mechanism to yield either nanopods or nanodendrites. The result is an ability to transition from one regime to the other selectively and predictably for, as far as we are aware, the first time. The transition is based on reaction stoichiometry, meaning that morphology can be altered independently of composition. Meanwhile, capping agent and temperature have controlled composition independently of morphology. Taken together, these developments allow the selection of both morphology (nanopod, nanodendrite) and composition (Pt-poor to Pt-rich).\nOur group is now extending these ideas to other bimetallic combinations, seeking to generate a wider understanding of Pt/M nanopods/-dendrites where M is a base, 3d metal. Following the preparation of Pt/M contenders with systematic composition and morphology control, they will be heterogenized for catalysis of the oxygen reduction reaction."
