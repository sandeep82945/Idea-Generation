"The topical application of dsRNA as active molecules presents a highly versatile crop management strategy that does not require plant transformation methods. Since naked dsRNAs are susceptible to degradation upon exposure to the environment, dsRNAs can be encapsulated or layered with biocompatible nanoparticles to prolong the RNA stability and increase silencing efficiency when applied in field-like conditions. However, the design and selection of RNA carriers will depend on several factors such as the RNA size (e.g., siRNAs and long dsRNAs), the target (e.g., fungi, insects, endogenous plant genes and viruses) and the method of delivery (e.g., trunk injection, spraying, petiole adsorption, etc.)."
