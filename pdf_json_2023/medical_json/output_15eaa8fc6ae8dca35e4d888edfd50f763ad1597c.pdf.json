    "abstractText": "Introduction: Drowsy driving is a significant factor causing dire road crashes and casualties around the world. Detecting it earlier and more effectively can significantly reduce the lethal aftereffects and increase road safety. As physiological conditions originate from the human brain, so neurophysiological signatures in drowsy and alert states may be investigated for this purpose. In this preface, A passive brain-computer interface (pBCI) scheme using multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) brain signals is developed for spatially localized and accurate detection of human drowsiness during driving tasks.",

Detecting it earlier and more effectively can significantly reduce the lethal aftereffects and increase road safety. As physiological conditions originate from the human brain, so neurophysiological signatures in drowsy and alert states may be investigated for this purpose. In this preface, A passive brain-computer interface (pBCI) scheme using multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) brain signals is developed for spatially localized and accurate detection of human drowsiness during driving tasks.\nMethods: This pBCI modality acquired electrophysiological patterns of 12 healthy subjects from the prefrontal (PFC), frontal (FC), and occipital cortices (OC) of the brain. Neurological states are recorded using six EEG channels spread over the right and left hemispheres in the PFC, FC, and OC of the sleep-deprived subjects during simulated driving tasks. In post-hoc analysis, spectral signatures of the \u03b4, \u03b8, \u03b1, and \u03b2 rhythms are extracted in terms of spectral band powers and their ratios with a temporal correlation over the complete span of the experiment. Minimum redundancy maximum relevance, Chi-square, and ReliefF feature selection methods are used and aggregated with a Z-score based approach for global feature ranking. The extracted drowsiness attributes are classified using decision trees, discriminant analysis, logistic regression, na\u00efve Bayes, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, and ensemble classifiers. The binary classification results are reported with confusion matrix-based performance assessment metrics.\nResults: In inter-classifier comparison, the optimized ensemble model achieved the best results of drowsiness classification with 85.6% accuracy and precision, 89.7% recall, 87.6% F1-score, 80% specificity, 70.3% Matthews correlation coefficient, 70.2% Cohen\u2019s kappa score, and 91% area under the receiver operating characteristic curve with 76-ms execution time. In inter-channel comparison, the best results were obtained at the F8 electrode position in the right FC of the brain. The significance of all the results was validated with a p-value of less than 0.05 using statistical hypothesis testing methods.\nConclusions: The proposed scheme has achieved better results for driving drowsiness detection with the accomplishment of multiple objectives. The predictor importance approach has reduced the feature extraction cost and computational complexity is minimized with the use of conventional machine learning classifiers resulting in low-cost hardware and software requirements. The channel selection approach has spatially localized themost promising brain region for drowsiness detection with only a single EEG channel (F8) which reduces the\nOPEN ACCESS\nEDITED BY Shujaat Khan, Siemens Healthineers, United States\nREVIEWED BY Nauman Khalid Qureshi, ETH Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland Farzan Majeed Noori, University of Oslo, Norway Haroon Khan, Oslo Metropolitan University, Norway Muhammad Sohail Ibrahim, Zhejiang University, China\n*CORRESPONDENCE Hashim Ali, hashim.ali@nu.edu.kz\nSPECIALTY SECTION This article was submitted to Computational Physiology and Medicine, a section of the journal Frontiers in Physiology\nRECEIVED 29 January 2023 ACCEPTED 09 March 2023 PUBLISHED 30 March 2023\nCITATION Arif S, Munawar S and Ali H (2023), Driving drowsiness detection using spectral signatures of EEGbased neurophysiology.

            "text": "Sleep deprivation and persistent tiredness due to environmental noise and excessive traffic could be the leading cause of driving fatigue. Mental exhaustion and fatigue may cause driving drowsiness onset. Vehicle drivers are more likely to nod off at the steering wheel during long stretches of uninterrupted driving on smooth highways and straight road patches. All these reasons contribute to drowsy driving, which is a leading cause of car accidents (Ahn et al., 2016). These accidents can have devastating personal, societal, and monetary consequences, along with fatalities. So, vehicular safety and driving drowsiness detection methods to avoid dire losses are always motivational aspects for researchers.\nThere are several subjective and objective methods to detect drowsiness in drivers. Subjective methods include self-assessment report-based test questionnaires to measure the level of drowsiness. Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS), Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), visual analog scale (VAS), and observer-rated sleepiness (ORS) are some self-assessment approaches (Poursadeghiyan et al., 2017; Baiardi et al., 2018). These reports ask individuals to rate their tiredness by answering questions, but most subjects overestimate their drowsiness. Objective methods for driver drowsiness detection rely on measurements of the driver\u2019s physiological and behavioral characteristics or on-road vehicle response to detect signs of drowsiness (Hu, 2017b). These methods do not rely on the driver\u2019s self-assessment report and are considered more reliable than subjective methods. Behavioral methods incorporate computer vision algorithms that use onboard cameras to detect changes in the driver\u2019s behavior (Akrout and Mahdi, 2021). Drowsiness is characterized by facial recognition, frequent yawning, delayed eye closures, rapid blink rates, lowered head posture, microsleep, or dozing-off behaviors (Rundo et al., 2021). However, identifying tiredness with behavioral cues, such as eye blinks, lipmovement, yawn frequency, and facial features,may cause false detections. These methods are accurate for online drowsiness detection but require excessive computational power and expensive equipment to run computer vision algorithms on live video feeds (Bamidele et al., 2019). Background variation and poor ambient light might cause erroneous detections. Vehicular methods measure the drowsiness with the driving performance, which is assessed through vehicle response measured with onboard sensors. Parameters such as vehicle speed, driver\u2019s reaction time, continuous lane deviation, missed traffic signs, and steering jerking are used to detect signs of drowsiness (Collet and Musicant, 2019). Tesla, Mercedes Benz, and others use behavioral driver assistance technologies to avoid accidents. Samsung and Eyesight collaborated to track driver attentiveness using facial patterns and features (Jabbar et al., 2020). They introduced assisted steering, automatic braking, lane departure warnings, and variable cruise control. Vehicular methods are not suitable for earlier detection as they ascertain the driver\u2019s drowsiness when an accident ismore likely. On the\nother hand, physiological methods measure various physiological parameters, such as eye movement with electrooculography (EOG), heart rate variability (HRV) with electrocardiography (ECG), and neurophysiological measures with electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). These methods can detect fatigue and drowsiness using bodily organs such as the heart, muscles, eyes, and brain (Kartsch et al., 2018). Some studies additionally examine the link between drowsiness and alertness using respiratory rate, skin electrochemistry, body temperature, etc. (Ad\u00e3o Martins et al., 2021). These methods are disruptive to the normal driving task and potentially cause the driver discomfort but have shown promising results in detection accuracy (Arif et al., 2021b). As each method has its pros and cons, deciding between vehicular, behavioral, and physiological measures is a challenging task. Drivers require detection systems to be less intrusive as well as more accurate with earlier detection; it is a trade-off between these two aspects. However, all the bodily states primarily originated from the human brain, so it could be a potentially useful location for earlier drowsiness detection if the intrusiveness of the physiological measurement system could be reduced.\nBrain activities are classified into three categories: active (intentional tasks like mental arithmetic, computation, and body motion), reactive (response to some external stimulus such as pain, audio, or video), and passive (unintentional activities like drowsiness, intelligence, possessiveness, stress, and fatigue) (Naseer et al., 2016; Qureshi et al., 2017; Nazeer et al., 2020a). Passive brain states aremore difficult to detect than active and reactive brain states (Alimardani and Hiraki, 2020; Belo et al., 2021). Detection of sleep or drowsy passive states during attention-seeking tasks like driving is most crucial due to the life risks involved. Non-invasive brain\u2013computer interfaces (BCIs) record the hemodynamic response of the brain, like changes in blood oxygen level, blood flow, and volume with fNIRS or electrophysiological signals and electrical neuronal activity with EEG. Due to low cost and effective utility, EEG and fNIRS-based BCIs are more widely used to detect activities of the brain (Arif et al., 2021b). EEG has comparatively better temporal resolution with less complex hardware, while fNIRS has good spatial resolution and more stable signals (Khan et al., 2018). Some studies are based on hybrid solutions to merge the benefits of both techniques and the application of these methods on real-life subjects (Khan et al., 2021). EEG-based passive BCI (pBCI) for drowsiness detection is a widely used method for measuring and analyzing brain activities during alertness or drowsiness (Min et al., 2017; LaRocco et al., 2020) due to its good temporal resolution. Various methods can be used to analyze the EEG signals and determine the level of drowsiness, such as frequency analysis, correlation analysis, and time domain analysis with machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques (Aboalayon et al., 2016). DL techniques may achieve more accuracy; however, they have several potential drawbacks, including data requirements, intensive\nFrontiers in Physiology frontiersin.org02\nArif et al. 10.3389/fphys.2023.1153268\ncomputations, black box problems, overfitting, and biases. ML algorithms are more promising and effective in avoiding such drawbacks (Khan et al., 2021).\nThe performance of the activity classification algorithm in the pBCI scheme mainly depends upon the number of features and their extraction complexity. Feature extraction is the process of extracting relevant and informative characteristics from the raw EEG signal to represent the drowsiness level of a driver. These characteristics, also known as features or attributes, are used as input to the classifier. There are several common feature extraction methods used in driving drowsiness detection, including temporal features extracted from the raw EEG signals in the time domain, and they include statistical measures, such as mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis (Nazeer et al., 2020b; Arif et al., 2021b; Khan et al., 2021). Frequency domain features are extracted from the EEG signals after transforming them into the frequency domain using methods such as Fourier transform, wavelet transform, or short-time Fourier transform. Examples of frequency domain or spectral features include power spectral density (PSD), alpha and beta band powers, and the ratio of different EEG frequency bands (Huang et al., 2014; Hong et al., 2018; Sasaki et al., 2019). Non-linear features are extracted using non-linear methods, such as fractal dimension, approximate entropy, and sample entropy (Li et al., 2018; Zhou and Li, 2020). Thesemethods are used to capture the complex and non-linear dynamics of the EEG signals. However, studies have shown better classification results using spectral features with temporal correlation (Awais et al., 2017).\nThe channel selection approach to reduce the number of measurement electrodes is effective in reducing the intrusiveness of pBCI. EEG channel selection is the process of selecting specific electrodes on the scalp to measure brain activity from spatially localized regions. It is an important step in EEG-based drowsiness detection systems as it can affect the accuracy and reliability of the detection results. There are multiple methods for EEG channel selection, including statistical methods which use statistical significance tests to select the most informative EEG channels, such as mutual information, entropy, or variance (Alotaiby et al., 2015; Min et al., 2017). Feature-based methods use features extracted from the EEG signal, such as PSD, to select the most relevant channels with maximum information gain (Arif et al., 2021a). ML-based methods use ML algorithms to learn the relationship between the EEG signals and the drowsiness state to select the most relevant channels based on the model performance (Hu, 2017a). The commonly selected channels used in drowsiness detection include the electrodes located over the prefrontal cortex (PFC) (Fp1, Fp2), the central region of the scalp (C3, C4), frontal cortex (FC) (F7, F8), occipital cortex (OC) (O1, O2), and parietal region of the scalp (P3, P4) (Quercia et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2022). These regions are known to be associated with sleep and wakefulness and are commonly used in drowsiness detection studies (Hong and Khan, 2017; Tanveer et al., 2019).\nIn the preview of the aforestated introduction, this study aimed to develop an EEG-based pBCI scheme that is capable of effective drowsiness detection with less intrusion for drivers and is computationally inexpensive. For this purpose, the primary focus is on feature selection to reduce the feature extraction cost and channel selection to reduce the number of required EEG channels while obtaining higher classification results with ML-based classifiers. In this research work, raw EEG data are collected from drowsy drivers during simulated driving tasks. In a post-hoc analysis of\nneurophysiological signals, spectral features are extracted from multichannel EEG data. Then, various feature selection approaches are applied to find the optimal features that are best representative of drowsy and alert brain states. After feature selection, extensive classification is carried out to find the single EEG channel of interest (COI), which is the significant contribution of this study. The experimental setup and adopted methodology are explained in Section 2, with detailed results presented in Section 3 and discussion in Section 4. Section 5 concludes the study with the main findings of the work."

Normalizing the importance scores in the same range with typical normalization methods and calculating their mean is not a viable solution either because this approach results in altering the skewness and kurtosis of the original shape distribution (Nazeer et al., 2020b; Singh and Singh, 2020). The considerable drop in the\nfeature importance score of adjacent ranked features is a considerable factor in feature selection as it shows the decrease in response predictive power of low-ranked features. Skewness and kurtosis of the original distribution must be retained when getting the cumulative effect. For this purpose, the GPI is calculated as follows, using the \u0396-scorebased standardization of feature importance scores to gauge all the results on the same basis and then averaging out to get the GPI:\nGPI 1 3 \u22113 i 1 \u0396\u2200f,i 13\u2211 3 i 1 x\u2200f,i \u2212 \u03bc\u2200f,i \u03c3\u2200f,i ( ) (12) where xf,i is the feature importance score of a feature f in the ith feature selection method, \u03bc and \u03c3 are the mean and standard deviation of the feature importance score, respectively, and \u0396 is the \u0396-score-based standardized value of the feature importance score. In this way, all the feature scores of all schemes are represented with zero mean value and score spread in the same standard deviation bounds. The \u0396-score standardization is performed in MATLAB 9.12 using its built-in function normalize. All the feature selection methods are applied to the channel-wise combined EEG data of all the subjects.\n2.7 Classification\nMultiple supervised learning-based classification methods are used to perform binary classification of drowsiness and alert neurophysiological states of driving subjects. Seven classifiers are used in this study: decision trees (DT), discriminant analysis (DA), logistic regression (LR), na\u00efve Bayes (NB), support vector machines (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (kNN), and ensembles. All the classifiers are trained, tested, and validated on a complete feature set and a GPI-based selected feature set. In addition, 10-fold cross-validation is incorporated in all training sessions to overcome the overfitting issues and maintain the generalization in predictions of the classifiers. An exhaustive approach is used for activity classification to achieve optimum results using various variants of all the classifiers and multiple feature sets. An analysis is performed independently for all the selected EEG channels to find the most promising brain region in terms of COI to achieve the best results for drowsiness detection. Furthermore, the hyperparameters of the bestperforming classifier are optimized with the Bayesian optimization technique to achieve optimum performance of classification results."

LDA draws linear class separation boundaries with the assumption of Gaussian distribution of the classes, while QDA draws non-linear class separation boundaries of parabolic, hyperbolic, or elliptical trends for blended data dispersion.

            "text": "The SVM classifier establishes the hyperplanes for class separation boundaries using the polynomial kernel function and\nradial basis function (RBF) kernels. The objective of the algorithm is to find the hyperplane with the maximum margin. The linear, quadratic, and cubic polynomial kernel functions are used to generate respective hyperplanes, but they are computationally expensive for higher dimensional data and take a significant amount of training time without a significant increase in accuracy (Qureshi et al., 2016). On the other hand, the RBF kernel-based Gaussian SVM achieves better classification accuracies with less training time for higher dimensional data as well. They are also effective for classifying the non-linear boundaries of mixed-class data dispersions. The SVM is applied using the fitcsvm function of MATLAB for this binary classification problem. Three Gaussian SVM presets are used here, namely, fine, medium, and coarse Gaussian SVM, which differ by Gaussian kernel scale of values P \u221a 4 , P \u221a , and P \u221a \u00d7 4, respectively, where P is the number of features. The hyperparameter of respective kernel scale values is 0.71, 2.8, and 11 for the drowsiness detection scheme with eight features. The SVM variants accordingly create fine, medium, and coarser distinctions and separation hyperplanes between detection classes. Fine Gaussian SVM is preferred over other variants with highly non-linear and blended data dispersion of different classes. The other hyperparameter is the box constraint parameter level C, which is set to 1 to allow the flexible soft margin penalty due to highly non-linear data dispersion.\n2.7.6 k-nearest neighbor The kNN algorithm classifies the data points in respective classes based on the classes of their k-nearest neighbors found with different distance metrics. This classifier is implemented using the fitcknn function of MATLAB with its presets. The available hypermeters are the number of nearest neighbors, distance metrics used to find nearest neighbors, and distance weights which make multiple presets with different combinations. The fine, medium, and coarse kNN made fine, mid-level, and coarser distinctions and class separation boundaries with 1, 10, and 100 numbers of nearest neighbors, respectively, while classifying the neighboring new data points in the neighborhood of their respective classes. These three presets use the Euclidean distance metric with unbiased and equal-distance weighting function, with the only difference being the number of nearest neighbors. The other three presets\u2014cosine, cubic, and weighted kNN\u2014are the subtypes of medium kNN (10 number of nearest neighbors) with the difference of distance metric and distance weighting functions. Cosine and cubic kNN use cosine and Minkowski (cubic) distance metrics, respectively, with no distance weighting function or equal weights. Weighted kNN is the same as medium kNN, with the only difference in biased distance weights. Distanceweighting functions used in weighted kNN are inverse ( 1D weight) or squared inverse ( 1D2 weight), where D is the distance between neighboring data points. Among all these presets, weighted kNN ismore likely to outperform due to highly non-linear data dispersion between feature pairs of both the EEG feature spaces. kNN algorithms are among the classifiers with higher classification accuracy, relatively faster convergence, and less training time.\n2.7.7 Ensemble classifier The ensemble classifier aggregates the cumulative performance of various weak learners to achieve higher accuracy. It is\nFrontiers in Physiology frontiersin.org10\nArif et al. 10.3389/fphys.2023.1153268\nimplemented using the fitcensemble function of MATLAB with various hyperparameters like the ensemble method, the maximum number of splits for DT learners, the number of weak learners, and the learning rate. The number of learners is set to 30 to avoid delayed convergence and yet achieve higher detection accuracy. The adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) and random undersampling boost (RUSBoost) ensemble methods with a learning rate of 0.1 and 20 maximum splits are the boosted trees and RUSBoosted trees, respectively. The bootstrap aggregating (bagging) ensemble method with random forest DT and 3002 number of splits is bagged trees. The subspace discriminant (DA learner) and subspace kNN (kNN learner) ensemble methods use randomly selected 4D subspace of features in datasets with a large number of predictors. The bagged and boosted trees tend to achieve higher accuracies for datasets with a smaller number of predictors due to fine DT learners performing well in non-linear class separation boundaries and blended data dispersion (Ali et al., 2023)."

In inter-cortex comparison, the FC (F7, F8) contains comparatively more power in each frequency band ranging from 40 to 80 dB/Hz for most of the subjects. For other selected channels, this range varies among many subjects and drops to 10 dB/Hz in some cases. In lateral brain regions, the right\nFrontiers in Physiology frontiersin.org13\nArif et al. 10.3389/fphys.2023.1153268\nhemisphere is comparatively more dominant, with Fp2, F8, and O2 having higher power magnitudes in all the bands as compared to their left hemisphere counterparts. This observation indicates the reliability of FC for spectral analysis.\nAfter the PSD estimates, the spectrograms were visually analyzed to access the effectiveness of the selected channels in representing the frequency distribution among the EEG bands. Figure 6 represents the spectrograms computed for each selected channel over the complete length of the experiment showing the spectral band power distribution. The vertical orange spikes rising above 20 Hz are the time instances of alert states when subjects were engaged in mental computation during the driving task. In such scenarios, band powers are higher among all the bands, especially in the \u03b2 band, as can be seen more clearly in PFC and FC. In drowsy instances and eye closures, higher band power can be observed in the \u03b1 band, as shown in O2 at about 10 Hz, and in the \u03b4 band at various individual frequencies in O2 and F7 (Arif et al., 2021a). Here, the F8 channel is the most promising in distinguishing intermittent brain states as it shows more crisp and differentiable peaks of alert states from the drowsy periods. Interband power variations can be seen more distinctively in this channel, and it distinguished relatively more alert instances among all. This spectral analysis declares the F8 channel as the best candidate for COI.\nThe F8 channel was further investigated band-wise to ascertain the individual band powers as representative features for brain state classification. The subject was alert at the start and end of the experiment, with intermittent alert states at the 16th, 17th, and 19th minutes, as shown in Figure 7. During these instances, the higher band power spikes in all the bands can be observed with up to 35 dB,\n40 dB, 45 dB, and 50 dB magnitudes in \u03b2, \u03b1, \u03b8, and \u03b4 bands, respectively. There is a significant loss in \u03b2 band power magnitude in drowsy periods, while total band power magnitude is only contained in the drowsiness-related bands (Cui et al., 2022). Even the \u03b1 band power significantly drops in more drowsy instances like the 9th and 10th minutes, with all the power contained only in the \u03b8 and \u03b4 bands (Awais et al., 2017). These inter-band power variations with changing neurophysiological states support the confidence in using spectral band power and BPR indices as features for drowsiness classification."

Figure 9A shows the ensemble classification accuracy for all 2D feature pairs and higher-order combinations. All combinations of \u03b4 band power achieved higher classification accuracies (\u226570%) than other feature combinations. This aspect validates the highest significance of the \u03b4 band power, as shown by its highest GPI score in Figure 8. The ternary combinations of \u03b4 with other band powers achieved almost 79% accuracy. The tertiary combination of all band powers achieved a classification accuracy of almost 82%, whereas the inclusion of the fifth significant feature (R3 BPR) did not further increase the accuracy significantly. The results of this approach agree with the global feature ranking. To minimize the feature extraction cost and yet achieve promising results, only the four most significant features (band powers) are selected.\n3.3 Classification performance\nFigure 9B shows the channel-wise average classification accuracies obtained using the seven classifiers under consideration over all subjects\u2019 data.

The average classification accuracy with the ensemble is highest for all channels, followed by the kNN, except for Fp1, while DT and SVM also performed similarly after the two aforementioned classifiers. This variation in the classifier\u2019s performance exists due to the use of different presets.\nA similar classification process is also performed for all the subjects individually.

These accuracies were obtained over five classification trials of each method in each channel. In addition, 10-fold cross-validation was used in each trial. All the classifiers achieved 60% and above classification accuracy, which is the minimum confidence threshold for BCI applications. Overall, the ensemble method achieved the best classification results among all the classifiers in all channels, with 85.6% highest accuracy obtained in the F8 channel of the right FC. The Fp2 is ranked second, followed by OC, and the left hemisphere is the last in this channel ranking. Figure 10B shows the execution time in milliseconds (ms) for all the classifiers. The LR classifier has the minimum execution time but achieved the minimum accuracies among all. In the best-performing classifiers, the ensemble model took the least execution time of 76 ms. The statistical significance of these results is validated with 2- way ANOVA tests. The inter-classifier comparison shows the\nstatistically significant performance of the ensemble classifier (p< 0.05) for both the accuracy and execution time. In interchannel comparison, significantly higher accuracies are achieved in F8 as compared to the others (p< 0.05), while there is an insignificant difference observed among them for classifier execution time (p> 0.05). These results recommend the F8 channel as COI for single channel-based drowsiness detection.\nThe corresponding confusion matrices and ROC curves for binary classification in each channel with the optimized ensemble are shown in Figure 11.

Multiple optimization sessions supported the confidence in using bagged trees to obtain the best classification results. All these reported results are obtained with bagged tree-based ensemble classifier and GPI ranked features, for all subjects\u2019 data. The best results of all the metrics are obtained in the F8 channel, with 85.6% accuracy and precision, 89.7% sensitivity, 87.6% F1-score, 80% selectivity, 70.3% MCC, 70.2% kappa score, and 91% AUC. The single COI selection is validated with multiple paired Student\u2019s t-tests between the results of F8 and all other channels. Formultiple hypotheses testing (m 5), Bonferroni correction is applied to obtain the new significant alpha threshold (\u03b1 0.01). All t-statistics validated the statistical significance of F8 channel metrics (p< 0.01) compared to highly correlated metrics of other EEG channels (r> .5)."

Cui et al. (2021), Shen et al. (2021), Cui et al. (2022), and Kim et al. (2022) used DL models for feature extraction and classification, which incur higher computational costs, but they used spectral features, which are more effective and representative of physiological brain states. On the other hand, Awais et al. (2017), Wei et al. (2018), and Choi et al. (2019) used self-extracted spectral features and conventional ML classifiers for drowsiness detection, similar to this study. It is to be noted that the mentioned ML-based studies achieved higher classification accuracies and other metrics as compared to DL-based works. A possible reason for this difference is the use of hybrid physiological measures as Awais et al. (2017) and Choi et al. (2019) used ECG in addition to EEG measurements; Awais et al. (2017) also used statistical temporal features in their work. Both these studies used t-tests to find an important feature in the feature selection process. The proposed hybrid feature ranking scheme used in this study achieved the best\nFrontiers in Physiology frontiersin.org20\nArif et al. 10.3389/fphys.2023.1153268\nresults among all, with only four spectral features extracted from timecorrelated spectral data and classified by ML classifiers with the least execution time. The minimum execution time of the overall scheme also resulted from reducing the number of channels required to be processed for activity classification. Shen et al. (2021) and Kim et al. (2022) used\u226530 EEG channels frommultiple cortices, while other studies mentioned in Table 3 used fewer EEG channels (1\u20137) from selected cortices of the brain (PFC, FC, OC, TC, and mastoids). It is to be noted that all the studies have includedOCchannels (O1,O2,Oz) in theirwork, while FC channels (F7, F8) are among the selected channels inWei et al. (2018), Choi et al. (2019) and this study. PFC channels (Fp1, Fp2) are also included in the analysis of this work and that of Choi et al. (2019). All the findings of the channel-wise performance of this study are positively correlated with all these comparative works. Awais et al. (2017), Cui et al. (2021), and Cui et al. (2022) effectively performed channel reduction up to a single COI for drowsiness detection in OC, whereas Awais et al. (2017) achieved higher accuracy due to hybrid physiology measures (EEG + ECG). In this study, these selected OC channels are promising and second in performance with comparatively better classification accuracy. However, our work has revealed significantly better results in FC channels which also performed better individually as compared to OC channels (Wei et al., 2018; Choi et al., 2019). These aspects support the confidence in our channel selection approach, which selected F8 as a single COI for drowsiness detection. In the comparison of performance assessment metrics, the proposed study achieved the best results with only a single COI andML-based classifier. Overall accuracy, subject-wise highest accuracy, AUC, sensitivity, and F1-score are significantly higher than those in other works. The only exception is the specificity, which is higher in Choi et al. (2019) by 1.71%. The reason for the lower specificity of our work is the class imbalance in the dataset, as shown in Figure 11A. Additionally, the use of ECG (Choi et al., 2019) also contributed to the change in specificity results as HRV significantly varies in alert and drowsy states. The dataset of the proposed work contains 57.1% drowsy state and 42.9% alert state samples. This class imbalance of 7% induced bias in state detection probabilities, resulting in lower specificity. However, the performance results are still promising, with 76.8% and 88% correct detection rates of alert and drowsy states, respectively, with only a single EEG channel. As the number of subjects in our work is higher than in other studies, itmay be a reason for achieving better results due to the availability of bigger training data. This aspect is promising as it provides more generalization effect and applicability for a bigger population.\nThe experimental procedure, collected dataset, used feature set, and time of drowsiness detection window have posed a few limitations in this study. As the dataset is collected during a simulated driving environment with offline data processing of the experiment, real driving experience may pose different issues for the proposed work. The participants belong to a certain age group with less frequent driving experience, so the proposed scheme should be adaptive for different classes of subjects. This study is focused on EEG spectral signatures only, so limited feature domains may have performance limitations. This work is effective for drowsiness detection in a 10-s timewindow, which should be reduced for earlier detection. In our ongoing research, neurophysiological data in controlled real driving experiments are being collected from comparatively aged subjects with higher commute frequencies as they are more likely to experience driving drowsiness. Furthermore, a new pBCI scheme is being developedwith a significantly shorter timewindow for earlier drowsiness detection. The time domain characteristics of EEG,\nhybrid physiological measures, and DL-based classifiers are also being explored for further performance enhancement."

            "text": "This study is aimed at designing a passive brain\u2013computer interface (pBCI) scheme for driving drowsiness detection with minimum disruption to the driving task. As all the physiological states originate from the human brain, it is a promising location for earlier drowsiness detection in objective methods than that of behavioral and vehicular measures. The objective is to develop such a pBCI system that must be ergonomically less intrusive and easy to wear or place at the driver\u2019s brain. It is possible if the pBCI scheme uses a fewer number of electrodes. To find out the single channel of interest is the main objective of this work.\nThe computational cost and algorithm execution time are minimized by introducing the feature ranking scheme in the feature extraction process. Multiple filter-type feature selection methods are ensembled with \u0396-score-based global feature ranking, and exhaustive embedded-type feature selection validated the feature ranking results. \u03b4, \u03b8, \u03b1, and \u03b2 band powers were the most promising spectral features, with 85.6% best classification accuracy in a 10-s detection window. Multiple machine learning classifiers were tested for drowsiness classification in which bagged tree-based ensemble classifiers achieved the best results of confusion matrice-based performance assessment metrics. It reduced the execution time to 76 milliseconds, with the highest performance as compared to deep learning-based models. In inter-channel comparison, the best accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, specificity, Matthews correlation coefficient, Cohen\u2019s kappa, and area under the curve are achieved for the F8 channel of the frontal cortex in the right hemisphere of the brain. All the results are validated with statistical significance tests (t-tests and ANOVA), which ascertained the F8 electrode position as COI having maximum spectral information gain and utility.\nThe presented single COI-based EEG neurophysiology scheme has a minimal ergonomic design which is easy to wear and less disruptive to normal driving tasks and practically detects the drowsiness correctly at an earlier stage to avoid life loss in vehicular driving scenarios. Improving the detection results with statistical temporal and spatiotemporal features in a smaller detection window or deep learning-based automatic feature extraction methods is the future direction of this study.\nData availability statement\nThe raw data supporting the conclusion of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.\nEthics statement\nThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by the research ethics committee of HITEC University Taxila, Pakistan.
