    "abstractText": "An Aspergillus fumigatus KMM 4631 strain was previously isolated from a Pacific soft coral Sinularia sp. sample and was found to be a source of a number of bioactive secondary metabolites. The aims of this work are the confirmation of this strain\u2019 identification based on ITS, BenA, CaM, and RPB2 regions/gene sequences and the investigation of secondary metabolite profiles of Aspergillus fumigatus KMM 4631 culture and its co-cultures with Penicillium hispanicum KMM 4689, Amphichorda sp. KMM 4639, Penicillium sp. KMM 4672, and Asteromyces cruciatus KMM 4696 from the Collection of Marine Microorganisms (PIBOC FEB RAS, Vladivostok, Russia). Moreover, the DPPH-radical scavenging activity, urease inhibition, and cytotoxicity of joint fungal cultures\u2019 extracts on HepG2 cells were tested. The detailed UPLC MS qTOF investigation resulted in the identification and annotation of indolediketopiperazine, quinazoline, and tryptoquivaline-related alkaloids as well as a number of polyketides (totally 20 compounds) in the extract of Aspergillus fumigatus KMM 4631. The metabolite profiles of the co-cultures of A. fumigatus with Penicillium hispanicum, Penicillium sp., and Amphichorda sp. were similar to those of Penicillium hispanicum, Penicillium sp., and Amphichorda sp. monocultures. The metabolite profile of the co-culture of A. fumigatus with Asteromyces cruciatus differed from that of each monoculture and may be more promising for the isolation of new compounds.",

Introduction\nMarine microbial ecosystems are characterized by high competition and an uneven ratio between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Studies of the microbiome of marine communities are often limited to prokaryotes, and only a few relevant papers include studies of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Their results show that against the background of a large diversity of species of bacteria and archaea, fungi are represented by only a few phyla [1,2]. This interspecific competition for resources stimulates the production of various secondary metabolites by all members of the community. Moreover, a marine bacteria\u2013fungus symbiosis was discovered, in which the bacterium can stimulate the fungus to produce an antibiotic, spiromarmycin, to protect against other bacteria [3]. Understanding the interactions of microbial communities led to the development of chemical ecology-related cultivation-based strategies, now called the \u201cone strain many compounds\u201d (OSMAC) approach, in which the microbial co-culture is used to stimulate the production of new metabolites [4]. One of the first reports was about the isolation of new diketopiperazines glionitrins A and B from a laboratory co-culture of Aspergillus fumigatus fungal strain KMC-901 and Sphingomonas bacterial strain KMK-001 [5,6]. Glionitrin A had high antibacterial and cytotoxic activity [5], while glionitrin B inhibited the invasion of\nMetabolites 2023, 13, 1138. https://doi.org/10.3390/metabo13111138 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/metabolites\nMetabolites 2023, 13, 1138 2 of 46\nDU145 cancer cells [6]. This example confirms the leading role of microbial exolites in regulating relationships in microbial communities. For about two decades, this approach has been successfully used to obtain a variety of low-molecular weight compounds from the co-culture of terrestrial and marine microorganisms. Caudal et al., from 2010 to 2020, reviewed three papers on marine fungi\u2013bacteria co-cultivation, 11 papers on marine bacteria\u2013bacteria co-cultivation, and 14 papers on two marine fungal strain co-cultures [7]. Co-culture has the potential to induce the production of novel metabolites, increase the yield of specific target metabolites with pharmacological potential, or inhibit the production of metabolites found in axenic culture. Since the diversity of secondary metabolites allows fungi to adapt more or less successfully to various environmental conditions, in some particularly successful cases fungi can become pathogenic to humans. This happens with the widespread Aspergillus fumigatus. A. fumigatus is a saprotrophic fungus that is pathogenic in highly immunocompromised patients because it is found in high concentrations in the atmosphere; it grows faster than any other airborne fungi at 40 \u25e6C [8]. The A. fumigatus genome sequence and a metabolomics analysis revealed the potential for synthesizing more than 200 compounds and the presence of over 30 gene clusters associated with secondary metabolites. The nonribosomal peptide gliotoxin, anthraquinone-derived trypacidin, meroterpenoids fumagillin and pyripyropene A, heteropolymer dihydroxynaphthalene melanin, tryptophan-derived indole alkaloids fumigaclavines, diketopiperazine alkaloids fumitremorgins and verruculogen, and fusidane-type triterpenoid helvolic acid are the primary described secondary metabolites which provide high environmental stability and defensive function against (microbial) predators [9]. However, the comparative investigation of the secondary metabolite profile of several A. fumigatus strains isolated from human as well as soil samples showed that soil-derived A. fumigatus conidia and culture media did not produce toxic compounds as toxic as fumitremorgins A\u2013C, pyripyropenes E and O, fumigaclavines A\u2013C, helvolic acid, and pseurotins A, B, D [10]. A. fumigatus fungi are also common in a variety of marine ecosystems. The marine fungus Aspergillus fumigatus KMM4631 associated with the soft coral Sinularia sp. was reported as a producer of a number of diketopiperazine and quinazoline alkaloids as well as triterpenoids, and some of them show promising bioactivity [11\u201313]. Moreover, promising marine fungal strains such as Penicillium hispanicum KMM 4689, Amphichorda sp. KMM 4639, Penicillium sp. KMM 4672, and Asteromyces cruciatus KMM 4696 were found and stored in the Collection of Marine Microorganisms (KMM, Vladivostok, Russia). Recently, some new secondary metabolites were isolated from the co-culture of Amphichorda sp. KMM 4639 with Aspergillus carneus KMM 4638 [14] and continuing this investigation is promising. There are several methods of metabolomic analysis, including NMR, GC-MS, LC-MS, and FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy), each of which has its own limitations and capabilities. At the same time, the LC-MS method has the best combination of simplicity, speed, selectivity, and repeatability, and therefore is most widely used for the analysis of metabolomes [15]. The aim of the present work is the investigation of the secondary metabolite profiles of Aspergillus fumigatus KMM 4631 culture and its co-cultures with Penicillium hispanicum KMM 4689, Amphichorda sp. KMM 4639, Penicillium sp. KMM 4672, and Asteromyces cruciatus KMM 4696, using the UPLC-MS-qTOF technique. Moreover, the DPPH-radical scavenging activity, urease inhibition, and cytotoxicity of joint fungal cultures\u2019 extracts on HepG2 cells were tested.\n2. Materials and Methods 2.1. General\nAn Olympus CX41 microscope (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an Olympus SC30 camera (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) was used for the examination of fungal cultures and the preparation of photography.\nMetabolites 2023, 13, 1138 3 of 46\n2.2. Fungal Strains\nThe fungal strain KMM 4631 was isolated from soft coral Sinularia sp. collected near Kunashir Island (Kuril islands, north west Pacific Ocean) and identified based on morphological features as Aspergillus fumigatus [11]. The fungal strain KMM 4639 was isolated from a sediment sample collected in Van Phong Bay (the South China Sea, Vietnam) and identified based on molecular features as Amphichorda sp. [14]. The fungal strain KMM 4672 was isolated from brown algae Padina sp. collected in Van Phong Bay (the South China Sea, Vietnam) and identified based on molecular features as Penicillium sp. [16]. The fungal strain KMM 4689 was isolated from identified soft coral collected near Con Co Island (the South China Sea, Vietnam) and identified based on molecular features as Penicillium hispanicum [17]. The fungal strain KMM 4696 was isolated from brown algae Sargassum pallidum (Vostok Bay, the Sea of Japan) and identified based on molecular features as Asteromyces cruciatus [18]. All used fungal strains are stored in the Collection of Marine Microorganisms (PIBOC FEB RAS, Vladivostok, Russia). The strain Penicillium hispanicum KMM 4689 also stored in the collection of the Nhatrang Institute of Technology Research and Applications under the code VO49-30.5.\n2.3. DNA Extraction and Amplification The fungal mycelia (mycelium) grew on MEA (malt extract agar) at 25 \u25e6C for 7 days, and then genomic DNA was isolated using the MagJET Plant Genomic DNA Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. PCR was conducted using GoTaq Flexi DNA Polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The ITS region and partial BenA gene were amplified and sequenced as described in [14]. For amplification of the partial CaM gene, the standard primer pair cmd5 and cmd6 was used [19]. The reaction profile was 95 \u25e6C for 300 s, 35 cycles of 95 \u25e6C for 30 s, 55 \u25e6C for 45 s, and 72 \u25e6C for 90 s, and finally 72 \u25e6C for 300 s. For amplification of the partial RPB2 gene, the standard primer pair RPB2-5F and RPB2-7CR was used [20]. The reaction profile was an initial denaturation at 95 \u25e6C for 300 s, followed by 5 cycles at 95 \u25e6C for 30 s, 60 \u25e6C for 45 s, 72 \u25e6C for 120 s, then 5 cycles at 95 \u25e6C for 30 s, 58 \u25e6C for 45 s, 72 \u25e6C for 120 s, and finally 30 cycles of 95 \u25e6C for 30 s, 54 \u25e6C for 45 s, 72 \u25e6C for 120 s, and a final elongation at 72 \u25e6C for 420 s. The amplified partial CaM and RPB2 genes were purified and sequenced as described in [14]. Gene sequences were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers OR578448 for ITS, OQ466614 for the partial BenA, OR600992 for the partial CaM, and OR600993 for the partial RPB2 (Table 1).\nMetabolites 2023, 13, 1138 4 of 46\n2.4. Phylogenetic Analysis\nThe ITS region, the partial BenA, CaM, and RPB2 gene sequences of the fungal strain KMM 4631 and members of genus Aspergillus section Fumigati series Fumigati were aligned via MEGA X software version 11.0.9 [21] using the Clustal W algorithm. The ex-type homologs were searched in the GenBank database (http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, accessed on 7 September 2023) using the BLASTN algorithm (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST, accessed on 14 September 2023). The phylogenetic analysis was carried out using MEGA X software [21]. The ITS region and partial BenA, CaM, and RPB2 gene sequences were concatenated into one alignment. A phylogenetic tree was constructed according to the Maximum Likelihood (ML) algorithm based on the Kimura 2-parameter model [22]. The tree topology was evaluated via 1000 bootstrap replicates. The Talaromyces marneffei CBS 388.87T was used as outgroup (Table 1).\n2.5. Cultivation of Fungi\nBefore co-cultivation, fungal strains were grown in test tubes on slanted wort agar in sea water for 7 days at 22 \u25e6C. Pairs of fungal strains were inoculated onto rice medium simultaneously by transferring a small block of agar medium containing mycelium and conidia. Inoculation of each strain in a pair was carried out at three points and at some distance from each other. Co-cultivation was carried out for 21 days at 22 \u25e6C in 500 mL Erlenmeyer flasks, each containing natural sea water (Vodolaznaya bay, Troitsa bay, the Sea of Japan), rice (20.0 g), yeast extract (20.0 mg), and KH2PO4 (10 mg). Fungal monocultures were obtained in a similar manner.\n2.6. Extraction and HPLC MS Analysis 2.6.1. Extraction of Fungal Cultures\nEach fungal culture with medium was extracted using EtOAc (100 mL) and then evaporated in vacuo to prepare a crude extract (Table 2). Then, each extract was dissolved in methanol and passed through column with C18-SiO2 (YMC Gel ODS-A, 12 nm, S\u201475 \u00b5m, YMC Co., Ishikawa, Japan).\nHPLC MS analysis was performed using a Bruker Elute UHPLC chromatograph (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) connected to a Bruker Impact II Q-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). An InfinityLab Poroshell 120 SB-C18 column (2.1 \u00d7 150 mm, 2.7 \u00b5m, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used for chromatographic separation. Chromatographic separation and mass spectrometric detection were performed as previously described [17].\nMetabolites 2023, 13, 1138 5 of 46\n2.6.3. UHPLC-Q-TOF Data Analysis\nUHPLC-Q-TOF data were converted from Bruker \u201c.d\u201d formatting to \u201c.mzXML\u201d using MSConvert 3.0 (part of ProteoWizard 3.0 package, Palo Alto, CA, USA) [23], and further processing was performed using MZMine (version 2.53) [24] as described previously [17]. Metabolite dereplication was also carried out with an in-house MS/MS spectral library, comparing experimental spectra and retention times (RTs) with the spectra and RTs obtained for reference compounds. A set of compounds previously isolated from Aspergillus fumigatus KMM 4631, Penicillium hispanicum KMM 4689, Amphichorda sp. KMM 4639, Penicillium sp. KMM 4672, and Asteromyces cruciatus KMM 4696 was used as standards for the microbial secondary metabolites. Structures of these compounds were established using various methods including 1D and 2D NMR spectra. Compounds were dissolved in 75% MeCN (0.1 \u00b5g/mL) and 3 \u00b5L of solution was subjected to UHPLC-Q-TOF MS analysis in the same condition as the studied samples. The full list of the standards for the microbial secondary metabolites is given in the Supplementary Materials. In addition, the annotation of some metabolites was performed by comparing the experimental MS/MS spectra with compounds from the PubChem database using in-silica fragmentation via the MetFrag service [25].\n2.7. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\nPCA analysis, a hierarchical dendrogram, and visualization of the resulting graphs were performed using the \u201cgoogle colab\u201d web resource based on Python 3.8 using Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib libraries. Below is a link to the notepad with the code used in the analysis: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qov-yZHRKp-L3Qq6 9iiLTakfzxGOpBYI?usp=drive_link (accessed on 7 September 2023).\n2.8. Bioassays 2.8.1. Urease Inhibition Assay\nThe inhibitory activity of the extracts on urease (from Canavalia ensiformis, 1U final concentration) was estimated by determining ammonia production using the indophenol method. A reaction mixture consisting of 25 \u00b5L enzyme solution and 5 \u00b5L of extracts (100.0 \u00b5g/mL final concentration) was preincubated at 37 \u25e6C for 60 min in 96-well plates. Next, 55 \u00b5L of phosphate-buffered solution with 100 \u00b5M urea was added to each well and incubated at 37 \u25e6C for 10 min. Next, 45 \u00b5L of phenol reagent (1% w/v phenol and 0.005% w/v sodium nitroprusside) and 70 \u00b5L of alkali reagent (0.5% w/v NaOH and 0.1% active chloride NaClO) were added to each well for 50 min. The pH was maintained at 7.3\u20137.5 in all assays. DMSO (5%) was used as a positive control. Optical density at 630 nm was measured after 50 min at 630 nm using a MultiskanFS microplate reader (Thermo Scientific Inc., Beverly, MA, USA).\n2.8.2. DPPH Radical Scavenger Assay DPPH (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) solution at a concentration of 7.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 M was used for this assay. The concentrations of the test extracts in the mixtures were 100 \u00b5g/mL. The mixtures were shaken and left to stand for 30 min, and the absorbance of the resulting solutions was measured at 520 nm using a microplate reader MultiscanFC (Thermo Scientific, USA). The radical scavenging activity of the extracts was presented as % to the control (MeOH).\n2.8.3. Cell Culture\nThe human hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA). The cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% of fetal bovine serum and 1% of penicillin/streptomycin (BioloT, St. Petersburg, Russia). For experiments, HepG2 cells were seeded at concentrations of 5 \u00d7 103 cell/well and the experiments were started after 24 h.\nMetabolites 2023, 13, 1138 6 of 46\n2.8.4. Cell Viability Assay\nThe cells were treated with the extracts at a concentration of 10 \u00b5g/mL for 24 h, and cell viability was measured using an MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay, which was performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (SigmaAldrich, St.-Louis, MO, USA). Optical density at 570 nm was detected using a MultiskanFS microplate reader (Thermo Scientific Inc., Beverly, MA, USA). The results were presented as percentages of the control (vehicle) data.\n2.8.5. Statistical Data Evaluation\nAll bioassay data were obtained in three independent replicates, and the calculated values are expressed as a mean \u00b1 standard error mean (SEM). Student\u2019s t-test was performed using SigmaPlot 14.0 (Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA, USA) to determine statistical significance. Differences were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05.\n3. Results 3.1. Molecular Identification of the Fungal Strain\nTo clarify the taxonomic position of the strain KMM 4631 we sequenced the molecular markers, such as ITS, the partial BenA, CaM, and RPB2 regions. Approximately 1300 bp fragments of the ITS region, about 650 bp fragments of the partial BenA, and about 650 bp and 1200 bp fragments of the CaM and RPB2 genes, respectively, were successfully amplified. A BLAST search showed that the ITS region, the partial CaM, and RPB2 gene sequences were 100% identical with the sequences of the ex-type strain Aspergillus fumigatus CBS 133.61T, while the partial BenA gene sequence was more than 99% identical. Phylogenetic ML tree of the concatenated ITS-BenA-CaM-RPB2 gene sequences clearly showed that the strain KMM 4631 clusters with the ex-type strain Aspergillus fumigatus CBS 133.61T (Figure 1).

PCA Analysis of the HPLC MS Chromatogra s of Fungal Extracts Principal component analysis (PCA) was utilized to differentiate between the extracts\nanalyzed via UHPLC MS. The PCA model revealed an optimal number of principal components (PCs) equal to two, so two PCs (PC1 and PC2) were chosen to describe \u224840% of the variation in the samples. The first principal component describes approximately 21% of the variance, and \u224819% of the variation is described by the second principal component (Figure 16).\nFigure 16. The principal component analysis (PCA) of all studied extracts.\nThe results of the PCA analysis showed that the extracts of both Penicillium strains Ph and Ps are very close to their co-cultures with A. fumigatus, AfPh and AfPs, in terms of the two principal components. The AfAc extract is the closest to the Af in PC1, and the Ac extracts is the most different from other extracts in PC1. The AfAs extract is a bit closer to the As than to the Af extract in PC2.\nThe studied extracts were divided into three clusters based on the PCA of the UHPLC MS data, which was visualized in a dendrogram (Figure 17).\nFigure 16.

Discussion In the present work, the metabolite profiles of marine A. fumigatus strain KMM 4631 and other marine fungi Amphichorda sp. KMM 4639, Penicillium sp. KMM 4672, and Asteromyces cruciatus KMM 4696 were investigated for the first time. This helps us to study the metabolite profiles of co-cultures of A. fumigatus with Amphichorda sp., Penicillium sp., Asteromyces cruciatus, and Penicillium hispanicum KMM 4689. In total, 20 known compounds were analyzed in this marine A. fumigatus strain and some of them had not yet been isolated from this fungus. A number of secondary metabolites such as gliotoxin, fumagillin, fumigaclavines, fumitremorgins, and fumiquinazolines have previously been described as the main virulence factors of A. fumigatus [51]. The strains isolated from environmental sources may display a decreased production of these metabolites [10], which can result in the higher stress sensitivity of non-pathogenic strains. It has been reported that non-pathogenic A. fumigatus Af293, isolated from decaying organic and plant matter, exhibits moderate tolerance to the cell wall stress caused by Congo Red and Calcofluor White, and moderate sensitivity to the oxidative stress induced by menadione and H2O2 [52]. Fusidane-type triterpenoid helvolic acid [53], which aids in the colonization of mammalian cells by A. fumigatus, decreasing the beat frequency of the ciliated respiratory epithelium, as does as fumagillin [51], was not identified in the marine isolate of A. fumigatus studied in the present investigation. On the other hand, an unusual nordammarane triterpenoid was isolated from this marine A. fumigatus strain [13], and its biological role may be related to adaptation to marine environments like the anti-inflammatory nordammarane triterpenoid decurrencyclic A [54].\nFigure 18.

The strains isolated from environmental sources may display a decreased production of these metabolites [10], which can result in the higher stress sensitivity of non-pathogenic strains.

On the other h d, an unusual nordammarane trit rpen id was isolated from this marine A. fumigatus strain [13], and its biologic l role may be related to adaptation to mari e environm nts like the tiinflammatory ordamma ane triterp noi decurrencyclic A [54]. Moreover, nine intensive peaks in the LC-MS chromatogram of th A. fumigatus extract were not annotate with any common metabolites of A. fumigatus, and this 15-year-ago-investigated strain may have become \u201csecond bor \u201d, via the use of actual techniques for th isolation and identificati n of minor natural compou ds. The joint cultivation of fungi mimics natural com unities and can have significant eff cts on the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. In addition o resource limitations, physical contact during co-culture induces cell wall integrity (CWI) stress [55], both of which ca se changes in th p oduction of compounds that act as second messengers r\nirectly (e.g., direct a tioxidants). The metabolite profiles of co-cultures of A. fumigatus with two Penicillium strai s, KMM 4672 and KMM 4689, were very close to the profiles of the monocultures of those Penicillium fungi. Nevertheless, their co-cultivation with P. hispanicum KMM 4689 resulted in the\nMetabolites 2023, 13, 1138 22 of 46\ndetection of two new unidentified compounds. Furthermore, three previously unidentified compounds were detected in significantly higher amounts in the co-culture of A. fumigatus and Penicillium sp. KMM 4672. The mixed cultivation of A. fumigatus and P. hispanicum resulted in the increased DPPH radical scavenging and urease inhibition activities of the co-culture extract. However, these activities have not been previously reported for the known metabolites identified in the A. fumigatus and Penicillium hispanicum co-culture. The metabolite profile of the co-culture of A. fumigatus with Amphichorda sp. was like that of the Amphichorda sp. monoculture. Three metabolites that were previously reported for Amphichorda sp. were detected only in the co-culture extract, but no new unidentified compounds were observed when A. fumigatus was cultivated with Amphichorda sp. A significant increase in cytotoxic activity was observed for an extract of this co-culture and it was accompanied by the detection of oxirapentyn G, isariin C, and isariin D in this extract. Isariin C has been reported as insecticidal against Galleria mellonella [56], as has isariin D [57], but cytotoxic activity has not yet been published for these depsipeptides. The cytotoxic activity of oxirapentyn G has also not been reported. Thus, the extract of the A. fumigatus and Amphichorda sp. joint culture may contain unidentified cytotoxic compounds. The metabolite profile of the co-culture of A. fumigatus with Asteromyces cruciatus is more distinct from those of each monoculture. Three known fungal metabolites were detected only in this co-culture and three unidentified compounds were observed in significantly higher amounts compared with the monocultures. In addition, the co-cultivation of A. fumigatus with Asteromyces cruciatus resulted in the production of two new unidentified compounds in significant amounts. As noted above, gliotoxin was not identified in the extract of A. fumigatus KMM 4631, and its derivative bisdethiobis(methylthio)gliotoxin was observed only in the coculture of A. fumigatus with Asteromyces cruciatus. Gliotoxin via the action of gliotoxin bis-thiomethyltransferase (GtmA) can transform into bisdethiobis(methylthio)gliotoxin [58]. This mechanism of self-protection against toxicity induced by cycling between the oxidized and reduced dithiol form and the generation of reactive oxygen species was reported for A. fumigatus [59], but could also be true for other fungi. Thus, gliotoxin, dehydroxybisdethiobis(methylthio)gliotoxin, and bisdethiobis(methylthio)gliotoxin were isolated also from a marine Pseudallescheria fungus [60]. It was previously reported that the production of gliotoxin was changed in response to contact with other microorganisms during co-cultivation [61]. So, gliotoxin plays a double role, i.e., it can both regulate the growth of a competitor fungus [62] and protect the producing fungus, as an antioxidant [63] during CWI stress. In the present work, the derivative of gliotoxin was detected only in the co-culture of A. fumigatus with Asteromyces cruciatus. At this stage of our investigation it is difficult to say which of them is responsible for the production of this gliotoxin derivative\u2014it could be either the result of A. fumigatus\u2019 self-protection or the result of a defense strategy of Asteromyces cruciatus. The co-culture extract exhibited a significant increase in both DPPH radical scavenging and urease inhibition activities. Previously, urease inhibition activity has been reported for trans-3,4-dihydroxy-3,4-dihydroanofinic acid and 7-hydroxymethyl-1,2-naphthalenediol from Asteromyces cruciatus [41], but the detection of only these two metabolites in the co-culture of A. fumigatus and Asteromyces cruciatus cannot explain the increase in the urease inhibition activity of the joint culture extract. Furthermore, the observed increase in DPPH radical scavenging activity of the co-culture extract raises further questions. These results confirm that competition between fungi in the communities is carried out, among other things, through chemical communication. Exolites that are capable of scavenging active radicals play a protective role in the interactions between community members. An increase in the radical scavenging activity of extracts directly indicates the activation of the defense system of one or both fungi in their joint culture [64]. The urease enzyme is important in modifying microenvironmental conditions and is utilized by a wide range of prokaryotes and microeukaryotes, including fungi [65]. The inhibition of urease activity can reduce the virulence and the viability of its producers. Therefore, the\nMetabolites 2023, 13, 1138 23 of 46\neffectiveness of a well-known drug targeted at Helicobacter pylori is based on the suppression of urease activity [66]. The enhanced ability to inhibit urease activity found in extracts of A. fumigatus and Asteromyces cruciatus, as well as the A. fumigatus and P. hispanicum co-cultures, indicates that fungi use a tactic involving affecting another member of the community. An increase in the cytotoxic activity of the extract of another joint culture also confirms the use of an aggressive strategy by fungi in the community [67].\n5. Conclusions\nThus, the joint cultivation of the marine non-pathogenic strain Aspergillus fumigatus KMM 4631 with two marine Penicillium fungi may result in the production of some novel compounds. The co-cultivation of Aspergillus fumigatus with Asteromyces cruciatus KMM 4696 resulted in more pronounced changes in secondary metabolite biosynthesis and may be the most promising for the isolation of unknown compounds or for enhancing the production of known bioactive metabolites.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/metabo13111138/s1, Figures S1\u2013S9: UPLC MS chromatograms of the investigated extracts, Figures S10-S40: MS/MS fragmentation of compounds 3\u20136, 9\u201321, 54\u201356, 58, 60\u201364, 75\u201378, 86, 88, 89, 94, Table S1: Experimental UPLC MS data for reference compounds.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, E.A.Y.; data curation, E.A.Y.; formal analysis, L.E.N.; funding acquisition M.P.I.; investigation, L.E.N., R.S.P., N.N.K., V.E.C., E.A.C., and E.A.Y.; methodology, R.S.P. and M.P.I.; project administration, M.P.I.; resources, A.N.Y. and M.P.I.; supervision, A.N.Y.; validation, A.N.Y., M.P.I., and E.A.Y.; visualization, L.E.N., N.N.K., V.E.C., and E.A.C.; writing\u2014original draft, A.N.Y., N.N.K., and V.E.C.; writing\u2014review and editing, R.S.P., M.P.I., and E.A.Y.
