    "abstractText": "Background: Women with pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain (PPGP) report diminished ability to perform physical activities and experience higher rates of mood disorders, such as anxiety and depression, than pregnant women without PPGP. Despite these physical and psychological impacts, little is known about the lived experiences of PPGP amongst Australian women and the ways in which they cope. Situated within biographical disruption and social support theories, this study sought to gain a conceptual understanding of the experience and impact of PPGP on daily life, and how women cope with this condition during pregnancy. Methods: A qualitative research design, situated within a phenomenological framework, using individual, semistructured interviews consisting of open-ended questions was used with a flexible and responsive approach. Purposive sampling of pregnant women attending a single hospital included 20 participants between 14 and 38 weeks gestation, classified with PPGP as per recommended guidelines, with a mean (SD) age of 31.37 (4.16) years. Thematic analysis was performed where interview data was transcribed, coded, grouped into meaningful categories and then constructed into broad themes. Results: Three themes were identified: 1. a transformed biography; 2. coping strategies; and 3. what women want. The pain experienced created a dramatic change in women\u2019s lives, making the pregnancy difficult to endure. Women utilised social support, such as family, to help them cope with pain, and a self-care approach to maintain a positive mindset and reduce stress. Although a few women received support from healthcare professionals, many reported a lack information on PPGP and limited societal recognition of the condition. Women wanted early education, personalised information and prompt referral to help them cope with PPGP. Conclusions: Findings from this study highlighted the complexity of living with PPGP as women attempted to deal with the unexpected impact on daily life by seeking support from partners and families, while also struggling with societal expectations. Although women with PPGP used a number of coping strategies, they sought greater support from healthcare professionals to effectively manage PPGP. These findings have important implications for the provision of health care to women living with PPGP.

BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022) 22:96 Background Pregnancy tends to be perceived as a joyous time in women\u2019s lives. Society portrays a picture of bliss and happiness during pregnancy, often highlighting the positive moments such as feeling the baby\u2019s first movements \u201ckicking\u201d and the pregnancy \u201cglow\u201d. However, there are unpleasant physical symptoms associated with pregnancy, including nausea, fatigue, heartburn and musculoskeletal pain which do not attract the same amount of media attention [1]. Of these physical symptoms, pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain (PPGP) is a common pain reported universally during pregnancy [2]. Pain is located within the pelvic area between the posterior iliac crest and gluteal folds, with or without leg pain [3]. Although prevalence rates globally have been reported to range from 7 [4] to 84% [5], a prevalence rate of 44% was determined recently in an Australian population [6]. Women with PPGP report a significant reduction in their ability to perform daily activities, such as standing, walking and turning in bed, and face major challenges in their role as a mother, undertaking household chores and work-related tasks [2, 3, 7\u201312]. However, PPGP does not only cause physical impacts. Women with PPGP experience higher rates of mood disorders, such as anxiety and depression, suffer sleep disturbances, and have a lower quality of life than their pregnant counterparts who do not experience pain [4, 7, 10, 13]. Despite the physical and psychological impact on daily life, little is known about the lived experiences of PPGP and the ways women cope with it. Coping has been defined as any cognitive or behavioural attempt, successful or unsuccessful, to manage conditions that are perceived as difficult or induce stress [14]. In order to understand the lived experience and coping strategies adopted by women, a qualitative approach is essential to allow for a deeper exploration and understanding from the perspective of women who live with PPGP [15]. A recently published systematic review of eight studies describing the experiences of women found that pain had a major impact on women\u2019s lives and families [7]. However, of the eight studies, only three included women classified with PPGP using recommended guidelines [9, 11, 12]. These three studies, all conducted in Sweden, reported that women struggled with daily life, avoided movement at home and work, and redistributed household tasks to partners, parents and other relatives [7, 9, 11, 12]. Although these studies reveal valuable information about the Swedish experience of coping with PPGP, there has been limited investigation into PPGP using qualitative methodology in Australian women, and the strategies Australian women use to deal with pain remain unknown. Previous studies have identified that women value support of health care professionals and the interventions that they provide, as well as information about the condition [7, 13]. However, it has been suggested that current health care services do not meet the needs of women struggling to cope with PPGP [2, 8, 11, 12, 16]. In an Australian study, only 25% of women with lumbopelvic pain received any type of treatment for their condition, despite telling their health care provider about their pain [8]. The reasons for low treatment rates are unknown, but a lack of knowledge about PPGP has been suggested to result in poor management and outcomes [7, 16]. In order to deliver healthcare that truly meets women\u2019s needs, efforts must be made to explore what existing and /or additional supports women feel may assist them to cope with PPGP. This has not been extensively examined previously worldwide. Thus, this paper aimed to explore the lived experience of Australian women with PPGP including the impacts on daily life, the coping strategies they adopted, and what additional supports they may require to help them better cope with PPGP. Knowledge gained from this qualitative enquiry will inform healthcare professionals of the care needs of the women they seek to support during pregnancy. Theoretical frameworks This study is situated within biographical disruption theory [17] and social support theory [18]. These theoretical lenses allow for examination and interpretation of the responses from women which are complex, real-world problems. Biographical disruption theory, coined by British sociologist Michael Bury (1982), provides insight into how people respond and adapt to illness, suggesting that it is a \u201cmajor kind of disruptive illness\u201d [17]. The theory highlights that biographical disruption does not result from a disorder, but from the ways that disorder impinges on one\u2019s physical ability to engage with daily life [19]. Suffering from pain during pregnancy can bring disorder to a woman\u2019s life and impact on her ability to perform activities of daily living. Bury (1982) also suggested that attention needs to be provided to the actions that individuals actively seek to counter the impact on their lives [17]. Therefore, the strategies cultivated by women to help them cope with PPGP were explored.",

            "text": "Methods: A qualitative research design, situated within a phenomenological framework, using individual, semistructured interviews consisting of open-ended questions was used with a flexible and responsive approach. Purposive sampling of pregnant women attending a single hospital included 20 participants between 14 and 38 weeks gestation, classified with PPGP as per recommended guidelines, with a mean (SD) age of 31.37 (4.16) years. Thematic analysis was performed where interview data was transcribed, coded, grouped into meaningful categories and then constructed into broad themes.\nResults: Three themes were identified: 1. a transformed biography; 2. coping strategies; and 3. what women want. The pain experienced created a dramatic change in women\u2019s lives, making the pregnancy difficult to endure. Women utilised social support, such as family, to help them cope with pain, and a self-care approach to maintain a positive mindset and reduce stress. Although a few women received support from healthcare professionals, many reported a lack information on PPGP and limited societal recognition of the condition. Women wanted early education, personalised information and prompt referral to help them cope with PPGP.\nConclusions: Findings from this study highlighted the complexity of living with PPGP as women attempted to deal with the unexpected impact on daily life by seeking support from partners and families, while also struggling with societal expectations. Although women with PPGP used a number of coping strategies, they sought greater support from healthcare professionals to effectively manage PPGP. These findings have important implications for the provision of health care to women living with PPGP.\nTrial registration: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN 12618 00142 3202.\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

            "text": "Pregnancy tends to be perceived as a joyous time in women\u2019s lives. Society portrays a picture of bliss and happiness during pregnancy, often highlighting the positive moments such as feeling the baby\u2019s first movements \u201ckicking\u201d and the pregnancy \u201cglow\u201d. However, there are unpleasant physical symptoms associated with pregnancy, including nausea, fatigue, heartburn and musculoskeletal pain which do not attract the same amount of media attention [1]. Of these physical symptoms, pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain (PPGP) is a common pain reported universally during pregnancy [2]. Pain is located within the pelvic area between the posterior iliac crest and gluteal folds, with or without leg pain [3]. Although prevalence rates globally have been reported to range from 7 [4] to 84% [5], a prevalence rate of 44% was determined recently in an Australian population [6].\nWomen with PPGP report a significant reduction in their ability to perform daily activities, such as standing, walking and turning in bed, and face major challenges in their role as a mother, undertaking household chores and work-related tasks [2, 3, 7\u201312]. However, PPGP does not only cause physical impacts. Women with PPGP experience higher rates of mood disorders, such as anxiety and depression, suffer sleep disturbances, and have a lower quality of life than their pregnant counterparts who do not experience pain [4, 7, 10, 13].\nDespite the physical and psychological impact on daily life, little is known about the lived experiences of PPGP and the ways women cope with it. Coping has been defined as any cognitive or behavioural attempt, successful or unsuccessful, to manage conditions that are perceived as difficult or induce stress [14]. In order to understand the lived experience and coping strategies adopted by women, a qualitative approach is essential to allow for a deeper exploration and understanding from the perspective of women who live with PPGP [15]. A recently published systematic review of eight studies describing the experiences of women found that pain had a major impact on women\u2019s lives and families [7]. However, of the eight studies, only three included women classified with PPGP using recommended guidelines [9, 11, 12]. These three studies, all conducted in Sweden, reported that women struggled with daily life, avoided movement at home and work, and redistributed household tasks to partners, parents and other relatives [7, 9, 11, 12]. Although these studies reveal valuable information about the Swedish experience of coping with PPGP, there has been limited investigation into PPGP using\nqualitative methodology in Australian women, and the strategies Australian women use to deal with pain remain unknown.\nPrevious studies have identified that women value support of health care professionals and the interventions that they provide, as well as information about the condition [7, 13]. However, it has been suggested that current health care services do not meet the needs of women struggling to cope with PPGP [2, 8, 11, 12, 16]. In an Australian study, only 25% of women with lumbopelvic pain received any type of treatment for their condition, despite telling their health care provider about their pain [8]. The reasons for low treatment rates are unknown, but a lack of knowledge about PPGP has been suggested to result in poor management and outcomes [7, 16]. In order to deliver healthcare that truly meets women\u2019s needs, efforts must be made to explore what existing and /or additional supports women feel may assist them to cope with PPGP. This has not been extensively examined previously worldwide.\nThus, this paper aimed to explore the lived experience of Australian women with PPGP including the impacts on daily life, the coping strategies they adopted, and what additional supports they may require to help them better cope with PPGP. Knowledge gained from this qualitative enquiry will inform healthcare professionals of the care needs of the women they seek to support during pregnancy."

            "text": "This study is situated within biographical disruption theory [17] and social support theory [18]. These theoretical lenses allow for examination and interpretation of the responses from women which are complex, real-world problems.\nBiographical disruption theory, coined by British sociologist Michael Bury (1982), provides insight into how people respond and adapt to illness, suggesting that it is a \u201cmajor kind of disruptive illness\u201d [17]. The theory highlights that biographical disruption does not result from a disorder, but from the ways that disorder impinges on one\u2019s physical ability to engage with daily life [19]. Suffering from pain during pregnancy can bring disorder to a woman\u2019s life and impact on her ability to perform activities of daily living. Bury (1982) also suggested that attention needs to be provided to the actions that individuals actively seek to counter the impact on their lives [17]. Therefore, the strategies cultivated by women to help them cope with PPGP were explored.\nKeywords: Pregnancy, Women, Pelvic girdle pain, Qualitative, Interview, Experience, Coping\nSocial support has been theorised as needing to be mobilized in response to the changes in life and social relationships [17]. In social support theory, the effects of stressful life events on health are reduced through the supportive actions of others or the belief that support is available [18]. Supportive actions may enhance coping and are categorised into four behaviours including emotional, instrumental, informational and appraisal. Thus, the social support theory provided real-world knowledge about what women need to be able to cope with PPGP."

Qualitative research was deemed vital as little is known about the lived experience of women with PPGP in Australia. This study was situated within a phenomenological framework in order to understand what the first-hand experience means for women with PPGP [15]. In line with the phenomenological framework, the semi-structured individual interviewing method was used to collect the data in this study. The method allowed the participants to articulate their lived experiences in detail [15].\nThis study was conducted at Westmead Hospital in Sydney, Australia, from November 2019 to February 2021. Westmead Hospital is a large teaching and tertiary referral government funded hospital in an urban centre with over 5200 births recorded annually [21]. The hospital has a catchment area that includes women from a diverse range of socio-economic and ethno-cultural backgrounds, educational levels and working status [6, 21]."

Potential volunteer participants were also informed that they could withdraw from the study at any time without their ante-natal or health care being affected.\nWomen were included if they were over 18 years of age, between 14 and 38 weeks gestation, classified with PPGP and had a sufficient command of the English language to be able to be able to provide written and informed consent and complete the interview. All participants were classified as having PPGP according to recommended guidelines, which included a physical examination [3].\nParticipants were excluded if they self-reported any medical or obstetric complication(s) that may have affected pregnancy including pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, serious intellectual or psychiatric impairment, systemic disease(s), or recent spinal fracture, trauma or surgery.\nStratified purposive sampling was used to ensure that the sample was representative of women with PPGP who attended Westmead Hospital such that participants were intentionally selected according to the needs of the study [15, 22\u201324]. Attempts were made to include women with a culturally and linguistically diverse background who were able to speak English. This ensured that a range of voices were heard and provided opportunities for women to be able to share their individual experiences who may otherwise not be included in this type of research [15]. In addition, a broad sample of women was sought, including those who had a partner and those who did not, women of differing paid employment status, and there were no restrictions placed on parity."

Studies situated within the phenomenological methodology have suggested that this requires between 5 and 25 participants [25]. In this study, it was planned that at least 25 women would be interviewed to ensure richness of the data with a broad and diverse sample. However, no new information emerged after the tenth participant interview. After discussion amongst the research team, the decision was made to continue to collect data in order to further probe and explore themes to be certain that that no further information became available with more interviews and to allow for deeper understating of issues raised by women. Previous research has reported that \u201ccode saturation\u201d may indicate when researchers have \u201cheard it all\u201d, but \u201cmeaning saturation\u201d is needed to \u201cunderstand it all\u201d [26]. Thus, our final sample included 20 women with PPGP in order to develop a richly textured understanding of the lived experience of women with PPGP. Ethical approval was granted by the Westmead Hospital (2019/ETH02528) and Western Sydney University (H12532) human research ethics committees."

However, all participants chose to attend a face-to-face interview. The interview was scheduled at a mutually convenient date and time at Westmead Hospital with each participant receiving reimbursement for the cost of transport or parking to the value of AUD$20.00.\nOn attendance, each participant completed a written questionnaire to determine anthropomorphic characteristics (age, height, body mass) and information about their current pregnancy, including weeks of gestation, parity, pregnancy type (singleton, multiples), and current pain level using a visual analogue scale [28]. Further information that was collected included country of birth, self-identified ethnicity, marital status, current physical activity level, and work status."

Key questions were followed by further prompts as relevant to the individual interviewee. Although, follow up questions differed slightly between participants, using an interview guide ensured the key topics were covered in all interviews [15]. The interview guide was developed by the researchers and the questions aimed to determine the lived experience of\nhaving PPGP. Women were questioned about how PPGP impacted their daily life, what changes to the performance of daily activities they had made, and how they felt they coped, including what strategies they used to help them cope with PPGP. Women were also asked about what other support(s) or information should be provided to help them be able to better cope with PPGP.\nThe interviews were digitally recorded and all participants were assigned a coded number and pseudonym. The interviews ranged between 45 to 60 min in duration. The interviewer made written notes during and after each interview which included observations, thoughts and ideas about the participants\u2019 responses [29]. These notes were then discussed amongst the research team to determine whether changes to the interview guide were needed to further explore the responses and themes offered by women. For example, based on a response by a participant early in the study, a question was added to the interview guide asking women about their views on judgement by others whilst experiencing pain during pregnancy. Similarly, women were questioned as to whether they felt they needed to plan ahead as a coping strategy when trying to deal with PPGP.\nThe interviews were transcribed verbatim by the first author (DC) within a week of completion and the transcript was then provided to participants.

A realist approach was adopted to explore women\u2019s experiences, meaning data were accepted at face value, participant\u2019s responses were taken to be a true reflection of their experiences, and quotes were interpreted literally [30]. Open coding was conducted by naming sections of the participants\u2019 narratives in the text [31]. There was regular discussion between all authors to ensure thorough and consistent coding patterns of the data. To enhance trustworthiness, codes were then grouped to form meaningful categories as agreed upon by all authors. Further, analysis of three transcripts was conducted by two authors (DC and AG) independently to see if similar categories emerged. The next step was to construct broader themes from the categories. Two authors met initially and discussed themes (DC and PL) with further discussion and comparison amongst all authors, moving back and forth between text and categories to enrich data credibility. As a consequence, some of the original categories were combined, while others were separated until the final framework of broad themes was established [32]. An audit trail was also adopted to ensure the rigour of the study, providing detailed clarification of the reasons for analytical and theoretical choices [15]. In accordance with accepted qualitative methods, data collection, transcription and analysis was carried out concurrently to be able to determine when saturation was reached [33].\nThe consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ) checklist was followed [34]. A published protocol details the rationale and proposed methodological approach of the design for this study [27]. Changes to the methods were needed due to the COVID19 pandemic. As a consequence, the study deviated from the published protocol by only utilising individual interviews as physical distancing measures, in line with government guidelines, restricted the use of focus groups."

I asked twice, thrice and then they said we will send you to physio\u201d (Emma).\nMany suggested they would give other women suffering from PPGP advice to seek help early as they had found it easier to deal with the pain.\n\u201cI would say go and get help early. Ask to see the physio and don\u2019t leave until they give you the referral. See the physio and do the stretches. The stretches are really the best thing. And you don\u2019t know what you should do without the physio\u201d (Eloise)\nWomen largely attempted to avoid taking medication, as they were unsure about the safety of medication during pregnancy or the effects it may have on their baby. For many, medication was a last resort if there were no other options."

Women felt cared for if they had a good relationship with midwives, doctors and physiotherapists. They felt reassured when examined by someone they considered an expert and greatly appreciated the recognition, support and care provided.\n\u201cYes, the physio saw me and gave me information, had a look at my back and pelvis. I am not saying you come out of the pain like magic or something, but at least you feel supported\u201d (Cassie)\nIn contrast, women who did not receive an assessment were not satisfied with their health care and did not feel comforted: \u201cNo one checked where the pain was or looked at it. How can I feel reassured that it is nothing serious when no one even looked at it?\u201d (Sofia).\nSome women felt they were brushed off by health care workers, saying their \u201cconcerns were dismissed\u201d, the pain was \u201cnormalised\u201d and they were left to \u201cfend for themselves\u201d. Some went even further stating that they felt the focus was entirely on the baby in pregnancy, with a lack of attention towards the mother.\n\u201cI think some recognition of the pain and some empathy would have been nice. Like as soon as you mention you have pain to the midwife or doctor, it\u2019s just shut down. Like the conversation ends. No one follows up, they don\u2019t ask you anything more about it. I think there is no focus on the mother in pregnancy, it\u2019s all around the baby\u201d (Sara)"

Those who received information found it increased their knowledge about PPGP, assisting them to manage the pain. However, the majority of women reported a dearth of information regarding PPGP, with some suggesting they had not received any information at all so they were \u201cin the dark\u201d about PPGP. Many commented that receiving information earlier during their pregnancy about PPGP in the form of written material and brochures may have been helpful. However, some indicated a preference for education and advice to be tailored to their individual needs, including the opportunity to ask questions.\n\u201cI gather that everyone is busy in the hospital, but it doesn\u2019t take much to ask about the pain and then give information to the person so they can know about it and ask questions. I guess that would help make us feel empowered\u201d (Sara)\nOther women reported seeking information on the internet due to the limited material from health care services or providers. A few women found information from the internet helpful, yet most suggested that it was hard to find credible information from Australian sources. Women spoke of having to \u201ctrawl through a lot of information\u201d, and being unsure of what was good information, preferring hospital sources of information for their trustworthiness and credibility.\n\u201cYou are not sure who you can trust on the internet and what information is true.

            "heading": "Discussion",
            "text": "The findings of this study revealed that PPGP transformed the biography of the women as it was an unexpected reality of pregnancy. The experience of pain made the pregnancy difficult, both psychologically and physically. Women reported a number of strategies that helped them cope including having social support and accessing health care services. These findings are supported by previous studies conducted in Sweden and\nEngland [9, 11\u201313], with the further finding that women expressed self-care as a strategy to coping with pain during pregnancy.\nAs theorised by the biographical disruption theory [17], the impacts of pain were both unexpected and unwanted, and caused a change in the physical ability of women to engage with daily life. The pain also had negative effects on women\u2019s body perception, self-identity and psychological wellbeing, which all combined to further disrupt their biography [17]. As Bury posited, in response to the changes in life and social relationships, resources must be mobilized [17]. In this study, resources in the form of support from others, including partners, family members and health care professionals, assisted women to cope with the interruption caused by PPGP. In particular, help from partners and families with household chores was paramount.\nWomen with PPGP placed a high value on credible information and empathetic care from healthcare services. This is consistent with previous studies of people in pain who have a desire for personalised information [35] and in studies of pregnant women with gestational diabetes who expressed a need for clear information from trustworthy sources [36]. Women also appreciated treatment by physiotherapists, preferring an active approach to management rather than a pharmacological one. Thus, the provision of information early in pregnancy and timely referrals to relevant healthcare professionals for personalised management may lessen the impact of biographical disruption to women\u2019s lives.\nWomen\u2019s ability to cope with PPGP was hampered by a perception of judgement from others. Women commented that they felt like failures if they were not seen as having a \u201cgood\u201d pregnancy. They were also keen to not \u201ccomplain\u201d or \u201cwhinge\u201d for fear of being labelled as weak or demanding. In the face of this perception of judgement, many women were reluctant to reveal the truth of their experiences, hiding their pain from others, suffering in silence and not seeking support to cope with pain. While not directly captured in this study, the perception of this external judgement has been identified previously to impact on women\u2019s moods [11]. Judgement of women is not a new phenomenon, but our work in pregnancy identifies the need to address community attitudes enabling women to voice their concerns without fear of repercussions and seek required support.\nExpanding on the concept of self-care as a coping strategy in Australian women, self-care has been defined as positive actions and the adoption of behaviours to minimise the impact of illness [37]. To combat the negative emotional effects associated with pain, such as low mood and anxiety, in our study, women adopted self-care approaches such as a positive mindset, and prioritised\ntheir needs to reduce pressure on themselves and minimise stress. Women may assume this approach because they perceive there to be limited options to help them cope, or to exert their own independence and take responsibility towards self-management of pain, perhaps motivated by a maternal desire to be able to nurture their growing baby.\nAustralian women discussed their experience of pain as creating some strain on their family, although it was not to the degree described by Swedish women in Elden et\u00a0al. (2013) who spoke of \u201cbreaking points\u201d in relationships [11]. The reasons for the differences in this finding may be due to ethno-cultural differences in the sample populations or the practice of self-care emphasized by the women in the current study. Possibly, Australian women may be reducing the stress placed on family relationships by utilising self-care approaches to maximise coping. Further investigation of the outcomes afforded by self-care is clearly warranted [37]. Nonetheless, health services may need to explore opportunities to promote self-care behaviours to women with PPGP, which may include provision of education, skills training and e-health options, to improve patient outcomes."

            "text": "The methodology for sampling ensured a large cohort of women from various backgrounds who provided rich, authentic experiences. The catchment of the hospital in Western Sydney includes women from a wide range of ethno-cultural backgrounds with over 50% of residents born overseas [6, 21]. This diversity is common to many urban cities in Australia and globally, thus providing a voice to women who may otherwise not be heard to tell their stories of pain during pregnancy. The thorough process of probing the emerging narratives provided opportunities for more women to share their lived experiences regarding themes, leading to increased confidence with saturation of information in this study. Women expressed gratitude for having the opportunity to share their experiences, provide opinions and articulate concerns, which was empowering and helped validate their pain, common to previous qualitative studies investigating PPGP [9, 11\u201313].\nThere are a few limitations to the cohort of participants. For example, all pregnancies were singletons. The majority (90%) of participants were in the third trimester, thus the impacts of PPGP may be different earlier in pregnancy. However, we know PPGP prevalence increases with advancing gestation [6], hence the reported themes will be common to most women experiencing pain. All the participants were married or in de-facto relationships, hence the findings may have been different if single women were included as they may report different social\nsupport(s) or a lack thereof. The use of focus groups may have added to the richness of the information, but were not able to be conducted due to the social distancing restrictions during the COVID-19 global pandemic. Therefore, it is not known if the information offered in a group setting would be different to the responses provided in a one-to-one interview."

The plight of women, as told in this study, highlights the need to improve attitudes and approaches in caring for pregnant women, both in the community and in the health care sector.\nPublic health approaches, such as education campaigns, may be required to promote the important role partners and families have in supporting pregnant women, and aid change in community attitudes towards women, enabling them to seek assistance without fear of judgement. Government policies may also need to be examined, such as flexible working arrangements and childcare rebates, to ensure adequate social support is provided in pregnancy. It is essential that health care services provide timely education, endorse self-care approaches, and adopt patientfocused models of care, including expert assessment and referral pathways, to ensure all women have access to the right care, by the right person, at the right time."

            "text": "The unexpected reality of pain and associated limitations in physical capability, compounded by feelings of judgement from others, creates a need for timely intervention and resources for women with PPGP. Women expressed that this was not how they had envisaged their pregnancies would be and experienced a disruption that dramatically transformed their daily lives and social interactions. Women rely on social supports to cope with the emotional and functional impacts of PPGP on daily life, and advocate for a self-care approach to maintain a positive mindset and reduce stress. The findings suggest women seek more from health care professionals, including early education, personalised information, and prompt referrals for treatment, to assist in the management of PPGP. There is a clear need for the provision of empathetic community support and responsive healthcare services to support women with pain to better cope during pregnancy and improve their experiences at this critical time of their lives.\nAbbreviations PPGP: Pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain; COREQ: Consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research; COVID-19: Coronavirus disease of 2019; SD: Standard deviation.\nAcknowledgements Not applicable.\nAuthors\u2019 contributions All authors contributed to the design of the study.
