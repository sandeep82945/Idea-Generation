    "abstractText": "University students experience a high level of stress, which could potentially affect how they manage stressful situations beyond university, such as when entering the workforce. Although universities offer counseling services and various health promotion programs, there is reluctance and negative perceptions about utilizing these from students. Further research is needed to explore the effectiveness of therapy dog interventions in human interactions that is quantifiable and embraces the elements of health promotion. This study aimed to investigate the impact of therapy dog interventions on students\u2019 moods across a multi-campus university during a 2-week final examination period. Two hundred and sixty-five students participated in the study involving a multi-campus university. The intervention group and control group completed a questionnaire involving the positive affect negative affect schedule (PANAS), a 20-item scale that measures a person\u2019s affect at the time. The intervention group (n = 170) had a higher average of total PANAS scores (mean = 77.63, standard deviation = 10.975) compared to the control group (n = 95) (mean = 69.41, standard deviation = 13.442). The results were statistically significant (mean difference = 8.219, 95% CI = 5.213\u201311.224, p < 0.05) with a t-score of 5.385. Students who engaged with therapy dogs on campus during the examination period were more likely to have a more positive affect. The results suggest that universities should include therapy dog programs within their health promotion programs for students, as these may help improve their mood and reduce the stress associated with university examinations.",

            "text": "Animal-assisted therapy is a goal-oriented health intervention using a trained animal for a wide range of people to achieve specific therapeutic outcomes, such as reducing stress levels [1\u20133]. Any species of animal can possibly be part of the intervention [2,4]. However, the bulk of animal-assisted therapy studies and health benefits demonstrated have focused on dogs because they are easily trainable compared to other species [2,4]. Animal-assisted therapy has the goal of improving a person\u2019s cognitive, emotional, social, and physical functioning [4]. Studies have found that relationships between humans and animals have shown benefits in physiological and psychological wellbeing [1]. Trained professionals can therefore implement a goal-directed intervention with a trained animal to achieve outcomes such as stress reduction [5]. The therapeutic use of animals has existed for decades, such as in clinical settings with mental health conditions for people with schizophrenia, and depression or with patients with drug or other substance addictions [2,4]. Other populations benefiting from animal-assisted therapy include patients with cancer, heart conditions, and neurological conditions [2,4]. Hospitalized children and elderly patients have also been seen to benefit from animal-assisted therapy [2,4]. The benefits of having a relationship with animals include improved communication and social behaviors, quality of life, and an internal locus\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 4759. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph20064759 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerph\nof control [2,4]. Being with animals also benefits patients by creating a calming, happy and comfortable feeling [2,4]. In populations with mental health conditions, interacting with animals has been shown to produce significant decreases in depression, anxiety, pain, and pulse [6]. Animal-assisted therapy has also been shown to reduce anxiety in patients diagnosed with major depression [7]. Children with disabilities show improvements in their behavioral management, and animals can also provide comfort before medical procedures [8]. Hospital patients in animal-assisted therapy groups have significant decreases in depression and anxiety levels based on measurements of their blood pressure, pulse, and salivary cortisol levels [9]. In patients with post-traumatic stress disorder, there have been significant decreases in symptoms of depression and anxiety, emotional distress, and alcohol use [2]. Psychiatric inpatients were seen to have improvements in their communication and social behaviors [4]. Furthermore, there were significant improvements noted in the living profile skills and social contact scores of inpatients with schizophrenia in the therapy dog intervention group [2]. However, despite these positive results, existing research is largely descriptionbased, using small samples of participants and rarely including a control group [3]. In studies that did use a control condition, it was often difficult to compare the effectiveness of animal-assisted therapy for specific conditions as different scales were used amongst the studies [5]. The generalizability of results is inconsistent due to the study format, study duration, and sample size [5]."

            "text": "University students have substantially low mental health functioning and experience stress at a high level [10,11]. Studying at university is linked to social and academic challenges that cause high rates of psychological stress [12,13]. Exams are an important aspect of university assessment; however, they can cause negative outcomes in the form of stress and anxiety, increased tension, depression, negative impacts on immune functioning, lower expectations, and lower confidence in grades and capabilities [14,15]. This can lead to poor academic performance and a negative view of their course and overall university experience [14,15]. Strategies to address the stress of university students are available with varying degrees of effectiveness and include cognitive behavior therapy and mindfulness activities [16]. These strategies are often underutilized, as students refrain from using services where they are required to disclose their problems [13]. Existing mainstream interventions for university students, such as mindfulness programs, are often limited by a lack of specific training, resources, time, and accessibility to large groups of students [15]. Thus, some students perceive existing supports as inaccessible or inconvenient and, as such, continue to experience anxiety regarding the examinations [1]. There is a need for preventative programs that address wellbeing and mental health that are widely available and can attract large numbers of students [16]. Interest has risen for therapy dog interventions at universities as these are cost-effective, easily accessible, require no training for students or university staff, and can reach many students who experience stress before exams [14,15]. Therapy dogs in a university environment, embedded as part of the institution\u2019s student wellness program, are an exemplar of a health promotion initiative using the Ottawa Charter (1986). Specifically, the initiative demonstrates achievement of health and wellbeing through institutional policy that creates a supportive environment, develops students\u2019 personal skills and connections to others, and reorients student support to broader initiatives that are inclusive of all students [17]. Evidence is growing for non-clinical population groups [11]. Animal-assisted therapy has shown stress-relieving effects in environments of high stress and anxiety [1], such as in residential health and educational contexts [9]. The use of therapy dogs for university students has shown significant reductions in outcome measures of psychological and physiological stress [18]. There is a substantially larger statistical effect size compared to standard interventions for addressing student wellbeing, such as counseling and mindful-\nness programs [19]. Students who lived away from home also reported less homesickness and increased satisfaction due to having the dogs on campus, which created a relaxed and soothing environment [19]. It was found that the use of dogs improved student perceptions of the accessibility of counseling services and was able to reach many students [20]. Generally, throughout various studies, therapy dogs were seen to be a source of comfort and stress relief that promoted a sense of belonging within the university community [9]. Although therapy dog interventions are seen as a suitable, cost-effective, and effective method for student mental health and wellbeing, only a few studies have reported their effectiveness with a standardized measure of stress [15,19]. Various studies have explored the impact of therapy dog interventions on students\u2019 physiological stress factors, such as blood pressure [18], nerve growth factor, and alpha amylase [14]. Barker et al. [14] conducted a randomized exploratory study with students (n = 78) randomly assigned to a 15-min therapy dog intervention or a control condition group. It was concluded that lower scores were obtained for nerve growth factor and alpha amylase from saliva were found among the intervention group, indicating a reduction in physiological stress (intervention first, p = 0.0001, d = 1.87; intervention second, p = 0.0004, d = 1.63) [14] In another study, Wood et al. [14] ran unstructured group interventions with a guide dog and found that the intervention group had statistically significant results post-intervention based on a reduction in blood pressure [14]. The study by Jarolmen and Patel [1] with 86 students divided into the intervention or control group had their blood pressure readings measured using ReliOn at 15-min intervals. The intervention group was permitted to interact with the therapy dogs between the readings, while the control group only had their blood pressure measured [1]. It was found that there was a statistically significant decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure for the experimental group and a significant decrease in blood pressure compared to the control group [1]. Several therapy dog studies have also found improvements in psychological factors such as stress. An intervention where participants (n = 132) had a duration of 20 min with therapy and dog handlers was found to improve mood measured on the Mood Adjective Checklist based on 20-min durations. When comparing a therapy dog and handler group to controls of therapy dog only and handler only groups, the mean difference was 2.62, 4.15, and \u22120.26 (p < 0.001), respectively [11]. Additionally, a decrease in anxiety was observed on the State Trait Anxiety Inventory; the mean difference was \u221213.73, \u221212.98, and \u22122.02 (p < 0.001) for the therapy dog and handler group, the therapy dog only group, and the handler only group, respectively [11]. Furthermore, interacting with a dog (n = 67) was found to reduce negative mood and increase positive mood on the Positive Affect Negative Affect Schedule compared to the control condition, with t score = \u22123.57 and t score = 3.52 for negative and positive affect, respectively [21]. In the study by Ward-Griffin et al. [22], students (n = 246) completed a questionnaire before and after the therapy dog session and reported improvements such as reducing negative affect, increasing perceived social support, and decreasing perceived stress compared with those in the delayed-treatment control group. Lannon and Harrison [9] completed a study where the university librarian asked participants to complete a questionnaire to rank their stress before and after interacting with the therapy dogs on a 0\u20134 scale from not stressed to extremely stressed. The undergraduate students (80.7%) reported a two-point drop in stress, while 38.6% reported a one-point drop, and 5.3% reported no change in stress [9]. Wood et al. [18] ran unstructured group interventions with a guide dog for students (n = 131) and found some clinically significant reductions based on the State Trait Anxiety Inventory with no comparison group. Additionally, it was found that therapy dog interventions had resulted in the lowering of stress visual analog scale (SVAS) scores (first p = 0.0001, d = 1.87; second p = 0.0004, d = 1.63) whereas there were no SVAS differences for the control group [14]. Studies also discussed students\u2019 perceptions of the use of therapy dogs on a university campus. Some studies have reported that students responded positively to the use of therapy dogs within the university [15,21]. Barker et al. [15] conducted a study where students\n(n = 694) completed pre-and-post surveys in which participants included demographic data and comments indicating their perceived stress immediately before and after interacting with the therapy dogs in a large meeting room, a week before the final exam week. Of these participants, 92.9% reported less stress after the interaction, 80.5% reported providing positive comments about their experience, and 4.1% provided negative comments [15]. Although there are existing studies on the impact of therapy dog interventions on university students, there are limitations on the sample size and the use of a control group to compare the effects of the intervention. Limited studies found conclusive results by measuring stress levels associated with exams [15,18]. Therapy dog interventions are still used for the purpose of managing student stress as they are resource-efficient, can target a large number of students, and can capture the interest of students more than other mainstream interventions [1,15]. Due to the non-conclusive findings on the efficacy of the use of therapy dogs and their effectiveness in lowering student stress [15,18], there is a need to further investigate the impact that therapy dogs may have on a large sample of university students of varying contextual backgrounds with the use of an appropriate outcome measure that may add value to health promotional practices. Furthermore, it would be valuable to explore whether any independent factors influenced the effectiveness of the therapy dog interventions for the students. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of dog exposure on the mood and affect of student participants on a multi-campus university during the end of semester exams, with three sub-questions.\n(1) How does exposure to therapy dogs on a university campus impact students\u2019 affect and mood during the final examination period compared to no exposure? (2) Were PANAS scores influenced by gender, age, year group, enrolment factors, and surveys on campus? (3) What were the students\u2019 perspectives regarding having therapy dogs on campus and having the university fund the program through their Student Services Fees?"

The quantitative component allows for reliability, validity, and generalizability of the results to the research questions [23]. This methodological approach examines the differences found in outcomes between groups and investigates the influences of other independent factors [24]. Thus, there is an exploration of causal relationships [24] and whether the use of therapy dogs impacts students\u2019 mood and affect. The qualitative component examines the perceptions the students have of how dogs impact them and their perspective on the use of funding for such programs at the university. The use of the qualitative findings can help to bring understanding to the changes in mood and affect of university students."

There were announcements on the university\u2019s main Facebook page during the examination period notifying students\nof the days, campus, location, and time the therapy dogs sessions were programmed. For each day, a campus was selected for the therapy dog sessions based on the high number of students attending exams. Therapy dogs and their handlers were placed in areas that many students would pass by, such as outside of the campus library and in group seating areas of the campus, where students were able to interact with the dogs. After approximately 30 s of interacting with the therapy dog(s), students were approached to confirm that they were a student enrolled in the university and to ask for their consent in participating in the study. Participants completed the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) survey on an iPad. Consent was obtained in response to the first question of the survey. To be eligible to participate in the study within the intervention group, participants needed to be (i) students at the university and (ii) observed to have interacted with the therapy dogs for at least 30 s. Students who did not provide consent were still able to interact with the dogs but were identified wearing a dot sticker to prevent them from being involved in the research data collection."

Intervention and Control Group Surveys\nThe intervention and control groups completed a survey, including the PANAS, a 20-item self-report instrument measuring positive and negative affect [26]. A total of 10 items of the PANAS represent negative affect and another 10 represent positive affect self-rated on a Likert scale of 1\u20135 from 1\u2014\u201cvery slightly or not at all\u201d\u2014through to 5\u2014\u201cextremely\u201d based on the present moment [26]. The instrument was used in the study to measure the mood and affect of students engaging with the dogs. The PANAS has been reported to have good psychometric properties, such as construct validity and testretest correlations [27]. The positive and negative items of the PANAS demonstrated good internal consistency, \u03b1 = 84 and \u03b1 = 0.88, respectively [27]. The survey also included various questions to classify the cohort of the participants, demographic questions about dog ownership and opinions on funding for therapy dogs on campus were included. Additional open-ended questions developed by the authors based on the literature were added to the survey for the intervention group to understand the student participants\u2019 perception of dogs and their opinions on student funding being used for therapy dog programs, as below:\n(i) Why did you approach the dogs?\n(ii) Select an option for this statement: I approve my student university funding being used on a project such as PAWS. (Options: strongly disagree, disagree, neither agree nor disagree, agree, strongly agree). Why?\n2.5.2. Follow Up Group Survey\nThe surveys for both the therapy dog group and control group included a question regarding whether the participant would like to consent to a four-week follow-up survey. The participants who provided an email and consented to a follow-up survey were sent an email containing another survey sent four weeks after the sessions to examine if there have been changes to their positive and negative affect. The therapy dog group and control group were sent the same follow-up survey. The groups were distinguished by the inclusion of the question about whether they had interacted with the therapy dogs on campus as the last question of the survey. The survey also consisted of the PANAS as a measure for changes in participants\u2019 positive and negative affect four weeks after the time of survey completion. Having post-intervention and follow-up scores would allow to compare whether the intervention group had a statistically significant difference in PANAS scores four weeks after intervention for each cohort sample [28]. Other survey questions included were based on the participants\u2019 health seeking behaviors, such as:\n(i) If they sought health services in the past four weeks; (ii) If they plan to seek health services in the near future."

The ANOVA was statistically significant for factors \u201cstudy group\u201d, \u201cyear of study\u201d, and \u201csurveyed campus\u201d (p = 0.000, p = 0.012, and p = 0.010, respectively) and suggests there is an association between the PANAS total scores and these independent factors, as shown in Table 5.\nNote: Follow-up groups not included in the ANOVA.\nTo evaluate the impact of the study group combined with the independent factors\u2014 age, gender, student type, enrolment type, year of study, surveyed campus, and course groups\u2014a factorial ANOVA was used. When combined with the \u201cstudy group\u201d factor, age, gender, the surveyed campus, and course groups were statistically significant p < 0.05, as shown in Table 5. This suggests that the PANAS total scores has an association with these independent factors in combination with the \u201cstudy group\u201d factor. The therapy dogs had a large impact on the 16\u201324 and 35\u201344 age groups. Although both the female and male factors benefited from the therapy dogs, the females had a bigger impact. For the \u201csurveyed campus\u201d factor, Campbelltown and Parramatta South are seen to have a large impact from the therapy dogs compared to the other two campuses. The course group \u201cNursing, social sciences, psychology, medicine, health, science\u201d was seen to have a greater impact from the therapy dogs compared to the other course groups."

Participants stated that they missed their own dog at home or had previously owned a dog. Many participants made positive comments about the characteristics of dogs. For example, one participant stated \u201ccause they are calm and cute\u201d.\n(2) Dogs having an effect on their own feelings and psychological wellbeing\nForty-eight participants implied that dogs have an effect on their feelings and psychological wellbeing. Seven participants mentioned that it made them feel better for exams and helped with their stress.

            "heading": "4. Discussion",
            "text": "The effectiveness of therapy dog interventions for university students was investigated in this study. It was found that exposure to therapy dogs showed on average a higher mood and affect, and predominantly positive qualitative responses were obtained, as is evidenced by \u201cDon\u2019t have my own but I love dogs. I have anxiety and [dogs] reduces this\u201d. Participants in the intervention group were voluntary and self-selected their participation. The control group did not interact with or view the animals and acted as a comparison group [24], which aims to identify whether the therapy dogs were associated with the PANAS difference. The current study found that participants who interacted with the dogs had a significantly better mood and affect score compared to those who were not exposed to the dogs. This is supported by the previous literature where therapy dogs increased the mood and affect of students studying at university [22,33]. This has been supported\nby previous studies where there has been a reduction in stress [11,22], a reduction in negative mood, and an increase in positive mood [33]. Furthermore, these findings are in line with other studies that found that psychological stress was reduced after interacting with the therapy dogs [1,19]. The current study contributes to the existing information regarding the use of therapy dogs for university students, with a larger sample size than most previous studies. In the current study, follow-up groups were included to investigate the post-effects of the therapy dog programs. However, with the low response rate, it is difficult to make statements about the lasting effects of exposure to the therapy dogs. There was not a statistically significant mean difference between the follow-up groups, and there is limited information on how the intervention affected participants\u2019 health-seeking behaviors. Studies using follow-up data and associating this with health-seeking behaviors require further investigation. The influence of independent factors on PANAS total scores for the effectiveness of therapy dogs was investigated. Studies have found that therapy dog interventions may have more benefit for female students than male students [34]. This is supported by the findings of the study, as females in the intervention group were seen to have a higher average PANAS total score than the males. The study explored the influence of other independent factors, as it is important to consider these influences on the effectiveness of the therapy dog interventions [34]. No other studies to date have reported findings on these other influences, and this study adds new information to the investigation of factors associated with the effectiveness of therapy dog interventions. It was found that, on their own, the factors \u201cstudy group\u201d, \u201cyear of study\u201d, and \u201ccampus of survey\u201d were statistically significant and had an association with the positive PANAS total scores of the participants. When combined with \u201cstudy group\u201d, all factors of \u201cage\u201d, \u201cgender\u201d, \u201csurveyed campus\u201d, and \u201ccourse groups\u201d had a significant influence on the PANAS total scores of participants. Thus, independent factors of the participants are important to consider and may play a role in affecting the effectiveness of the therapy dog interventions. It was found that the 16\u201324 and 35\u201344 age groups had a higher PANAS score than the 25\u201334 age group. It is difficult to ascertain why this may be. In Australia, pet ownership is highest for those aged 18\u201324 years (70%) followed by those aged 40\u201354 years (66%) [35], and this may help explain a pre-existing familiarity with and appreciation of the calming effect of dogs in these age groups. Women are also the group with the highest proportion of pet owners [36], and this may help explain the more dominant affectionate connection to and calming effects on this gender. Thematic analysis was conducted to understand the reactions to the therapy dogs and the use of university funding from the participants in the intervention group. The responses obtained from the participants support the literature on students\u2019 perceptions of therapy dogs on campus. As in the previous literature, therapy dogs were found in this study to create calm and happy feelings [2,15]. Shared by one participant, where the dogs do not require anything extra from participants \u201cBecause they are so friendly and they don\u2019t want anything from you except company\u201d. Similarly, for studies conducted in the university environment, student responses indicated that the therapy dogs did promote a relaxed and comfortable environment [9,20]. This was supported by participants statements \u201cjust had a bad exam and this would make me feel a little better\u201d and \u201cJust had a bad exam and this would make me feel a little better\u201d. Furthermore, the majority of the responses were positive comments regarding the therapy dogs and the program [1], supported by many statements of \u201cI love dogs\u201d This supports the quantitative findings suggesting that having therapy dogs on campus can improve mood and psychological wellbeing during examination time. The study highlighted how a relatively simple health promotion intervention using dogs created an environment that supported student health and well-being. Such health promotion interventions are good examples of how educational institutions can fulfill their social responsibility by promoting the health and wellbeing of students and staff in\naddition to their core businesses of education and research generation [36]. Additional benefits may include improved student retention and progression, given the program may have also initiated student connection and community, a known contributor to reducing attrition [37]. Future studies could also investigate these longer-term benefits for students and universities."

            "text": "Despite using a standardized assessment tool, it is difficult to generalize the study findings to the university population due to the sample size, the unequal distribution of the sample characteristics, and the unequal number of participants among the intervention and control groups. Sampling bias may be caused by the recruitment method using voluntary participants and the low response rate for the follow up surveys. Furthermore, it is difficult to ascertain whether the PANAS scores were directly influenced by the interaction with the therapy dogs."

However, due to challenges with the natural university location and program arrangements, the current study was unable to create an experimental environment where participants could be surveyed before interacting with the therapy dogs. It was also difficult to arrange data collection after interacting with the therapy dogs, as students wanted to go directly to their examinations. Future studies should investigate the direct effect of the exposure to therapy dogs using a confirmatory trial with pre-and-post intervention with a standardized outcome measure. Also, future studies should investigate the intricacies behind the influence of certain independent factors. The study should also be applied to other population groups."

As a result, health promotion professionals in education and health settings should explore the use of therapy dogs to improve mood and affect for students, staff, and clients during exams and other times of stress within the university environment.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization: N.P. and C.T.; Methodology: N.P. and C.T.; Software: C.T.; Validation: N.P. and C.T.; Investigation: N.P., C.T. and K.N.; Resources: N.P. and C.T.; Data curation: K.N.; Writing\u2014original draft: K.N.; Preparation: N.P. and C.T.; Writing\u2014review and editing: N.P. and C.T.
