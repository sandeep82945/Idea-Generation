    "abstractText": "The current investigation is focused on the development of composite membranes based on polymeric ionic liquids (PILs) containing imidazolium and pyridinium polycations with various counterions, including hexafluorophosphate, tetrafluoroborate, and bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide. A combination of spectroscopic methods was used to identify the synthesized PILs and characterize their interaction with carbon dioxide. The density and surface free energy of polymers were performed by wettability measurements, and the results are in good agreement with the permeability and selectivity obtained within the gas transport tests. It was shown that the membranes with a selective layer based on PILs exhibit relatively high permeability with CO2 and high ideal selectivity CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2. Additionally, it was found that the type of an anion significantly affects the performance of the obtained membranes, with the most pronounced effect from bis-triflimide-based polymers, showing the highest permeability coefficient. These results provide valuable insights into the design and optimization of PIL-based membranes for natural and flue gas treatment.",

            "text": "Modern society is moving towards the transition to the sixth technological paradigm, sustainable technologies, and ESG (Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance) [1]. In this regard, chemical engineering is actively searching for economically beneficial and environmentally friendly approaches to meet the current needs of holistic chemical and petroleum production. Membrane technologies are in a large part considered the main alternative to traditional methods of purification and separation of substances due to their high energy efficiency. This is because they enable continuous processes without the need to replace or regenerate the chemical sorbent [2]. Moreover, membrane processes\u2019 hardware is\nMembranes 2023, 13, 539. https://doi.org/10.3390/membranes13060539 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/membranes\nMembranes 2023, 13, 539 2 of 18\ncompact, and easy to operate, manage, and scale when compared to sorption separation of substances. These advantages have caused the rapid development of membrane technologies since the 1960s [3]. Since then, the variety of membranes and membrane systems has grown more than a hundredfold, and the annual production of membrane materials exceeds several tens of millions of square meters. Industrial applications of membrane processes fall into six main groups: reverse osmosis, ultrafiltration, microfiltration, electrodialysis, gas separation, and pervaporation [4]. Baromembrane processes, which include the first three groups, as well as the use of electrodialysis for the desalination of brackish groundwater, are the most commercially developed areas of membrane technology [5]. However, the commercial application of diffusion processes\u2014gas separation and pervaporation\u2014is also growing, with nearly twenty companies worldwide implementing membrane gas separation and pervaporation systems. The potential of membrane applications for obtaining high-purity gases for microelectronics, the production of liquid nitrogen, hydrogen purification for ammonia production, the drying of organic solvents, and especially acid gas and other impurities separation from natural gas has led to a scientific trend in the study of diffusion processes [6]. Currently, the leading industrial application of diffusion processes is natural gas prepipeline treatment [7]. Although the composition of natural gas varies depending on the certain source, the main impurities, such as water, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and hydrogen sulfide, are always present in the stream. Membrane gas separation techniques are mostly focused on removing acid gases from light alkanes, particularly methane. Carbon dioxide is the main target for membrane separation due to its significant presence in the vast majority of natural gas sources. The presence of CO2 can cause undesirable issues, such as corrosion and a reduction in the energy impact of the fuel [8]. Besides the natural gas treatment, membrane technology is also applicable to CO2 separation from flue gas and biogas. Polymeric materials currently dominate the market in membrane-based gas separations [6], driving further development of polymer membrane science. Several types of polymer materials have been extensively studied for CO2 separation and capture, including polymeric ionic liquids, rubbery polymers with a high content of ether oxygen, perfluoropolymers, and polymers of intrinsic microporosity, among others [9]. In this study, we focus on polymeric ionic liquids as a promising type of polymer matrix for membranes, providing high CO2/CH4 or CO2/N2 selectivity. Ionic liquids (ILs) have been attracting much attention in the field of membrane gas separation [10] since the first report of CO2 capture by this class of salts [11]. Liquid at ambient conditions ILs, also known as room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) [12], have been widely studied as liquid phase absorbent of CO2 in supported liquid membranes (SILMs) [13\u201318], mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) [19] and in advanced materials based on inorganic oxides for CO2 capture [20,21]. SILMs are obtained by impregnating RTILs into porous polymer supports, and MMMs are synthesized by mixing RTILs with polymer solution before membrane casting. While ILs-based membranes have shown great potential for CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 separations [13\u201315], they cannot withstand high transmembrane pressure, as RTILs tend to leak out from a porous support [22]. To solve this problem, their polymerized analogues\u2014polymeric ionic liquids (PILs)\u2014have been implemented instead of low molecular weight substances, allowing the combination of macromolecular features with the unique properties of ILs [23\u201325]. PILs are formally composed of \u201cIL\u2019s moieties\u201d covalently linked into a polymer backbone. Two main strategies are used for PILs synthesis: (1) the polymerization of the corresponding monomeric IL [26\u201329] or (2) the modification a polymer precursor [30\u201334]. Although the first route allows precise control of polymer composition and structure, the polymerization process is complicated by the redistribution of electron density caused by ionic groups, which limits the achievement of high degrees of conversion during polymerization and obtaining high molecular weight polymers [28]. The second approach allows the synthesis of high molecular weight PILs, but the composition of the polymer may not be entirely uniform due to the less than 100% degree of modification caused by\nMembranes 2023, 13, 539 3 of 18\nsteric hindrance of the polymer chains [34]. Since the pioneering work was published by Nobel\u2019s group [35], PILs have been extensively studied as a membrane material in a gas separation field [10,36\u201339]. Although some PILs in combination with ILs exhibit extraordinary selectivity for CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2 gas pairs and overcome the Robeson upper bound [40,41], they also have some disadvantages as a membrane material. Most PILs proposed as membrane matrix for CO2 separation form brittle films incapable of withstanding the pressure drop of the gas flow. Another problem is the drastic decrease of CO2 permeability in the direct ratio to polymer molecular weight [42]. However, a wide range of possibilities for polymer design through a reasonable choice of monomeric units, as well as polymer structure, may significantly improve a polymer\u2019s performance as a membrane material for CO2 separation. In the case of PILs, both the type of ions and the nature of the polymer backbone play a significant role in membrane separation performance [28,43\u201345]. Recently, polymerizable ILs based on vinylbenzyl chloride (VBCl) modified with ammonium moieties have been proposed and investigated as CO2 adsorbents and gas separation membrane matrices [27,44,46\u201350]. Noble\u2019s group has shown that styrene-based PILs are more CO2selective than vinyl-based PILs [48]. Polystyrene is indeed a good choice for a PIL backbone due to its exceptional mechanical properties and relatively high Tg. Incorporating ionic substitutes undoubtedly influences the overall properties of PILs, however, styrene and VBCl are cheap, available, and easy-to-modify starting materials. In Table 1, we have summarized the gas separation properties of membranes synthesized from VBCl homopolymer derivatives that have been previously reported in the literature.\nAlthough some advantages of applying styrene-based PILs in membrane design have been demonstrated, there remains a need for a deeper understanding of how ionic composition affects CO2 separation performance for this class of polyelectrolytes. This work focuses on the synthesis and characterization of PILs with polystyrene as the polymer backbone, utilizing either methylimidazolium or pyridinium cationic substitutes and a range of counter-anions: chloride [Cl], tetrafluoroborate [BF4], hexafluorophosphate [PF6], and bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [Tf2N]. Composite gas separation membranes based on the synthesized PILs were prepared and tested for individual gases (CO2, CH4, and N2) permeation to investigate the influence of polycation functionality and anion type on the CO2 separation performance of styrene-based PILs.\nMembranes 2023, 13, 539 4 of 18"

            "text": "It was previously shown by L. C. Tom\u00e9 [42] that PIL properties strongly depend on the polymer\u2019s molecular weight. Medium-molecular-weight polymers (~200 kDa) demonstrated optimal thermal, mechanical, and transport properties. In the current case, PILs were synthesized by the functionalization of a polymer precursor\u2014pVBCl. The results of pVBCl molecular weight and polydispersity determined by GPC are represented in Table 3.\npVBCl synthesized by radical polymerization is characterized by a high polydispersity expected for a radical process without the use of chain transfer agents. Since functionalization does not significantly influence the length of polymer chains, PILs\u2019 molecular weight could be defined as medium (~200 kDa). PILs synthesis includes stages of tertiary amine quaternization and anion exchange. Both reactions are complicated by a sterical hindrance related to the polymeric nature of the substrate. This leads to incomplete functionalization of the initial pVBCl. FD and ExD, determined conductometrically, are listed in Table 4.\nA notable difference in ExD is observed for PILs containing Tf2N anions if compared with BF4 and PF6. For both pVBmimTf2N and pVBPyPyTf2N, ExD is much higher, which might be caused by the formation of a polymer with a loosened structure that facilitates an ion exchange reaction. The formation of PILs was confirmed by a combination of 1H NMR and ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. The data is represented in Supplementary Materials in Table S2 for 1H NMR and in Figures S1\u2013S6 for ATR-FTIR. ATR-FTIR spectra for PILs containing Tf2N anion are represented in Figures 2 and 3. After exposure to the CO2 atmosphere, a strong CO2 asymmetric stretch (\u03bd3) bond is observed for PIL spectra in the region 2333\u20132341 cm\u22121.\nMembranes 2023, 13, 539 9 of 18\nMembranes\u00a02023,\u00a013,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 9\u00a0 of\u00a0 19\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nand\u00a0in\u00a0Figures\u00a0S1\u2013S6\u00a0for\u00a0ATR-FTIR.\u00a0ATR-FTIR\u00a0spectra\u00a0for\u00a0PILs\u00a0containing\u00a0Tf2N\u00a0anion\u00a0are\u00a0 represented\u00a0in\u00a0Figures\u00a02\u00a0and\u00a03.\u00a0After\u00a0exposure\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0CO2\u00a0atmosphere,\u00a0a\u00a0strong\u00a0CO2\u00a0asymmetric\u00a0stretch\u00a0(\u03bd3)\u00a0bond\u00a0is\u00a0observed\u00a0for\u00a0PIL\u00a0spectra\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0region\u00a02333\u20132341\u00a0cm\u22121.\u00a0 \u00a0\nFigure\u00a02.\u00a0FTIR\u00a0spectra\u00a0of\u00a0pure\u00a0pVBmimTf2N,\u00a0pVBmimTf2N\u00a0after\u00a0CO2\u00a0adsorption,\u00a0and\u00a0pVBmimTf2N\u00a0\nafter\u00a0CO2\u00a0desorption.\u00a0\nFigure\u00a03.\u00a0FTIR\u00a0spectra\u00a0of\u00a0pure\u00a0pVBPyTf2N,\u00a0pVBPyTf2N\u00a0after\u00a0CO2\u00a0adsorption,\u00a0and\u00a0pVBPyTf2N\u00a0after\u00a0\nCO2\u00a0desorption.\u00a0\nTable\u00a05\u00a0compares\u00a0 the\u00a0position\u00a0of\u00a0 the\u00a0 \u03bd3\u00a0CO2\u00a0bond\u00a0after\u00a0 interaction\u00a0with\u00a0PILs\u00a0with\u00a0 those\u00a0of\u00a0free\u00a0CO2\u00a0of\u00a0solid\u00a0and\u00a0gas\u00a0states.\u00a0It\u00a0is\u00a0worth\u00a0noting\u00a0that\u00a0\u03bd3\u00a0CO2\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0PILs\u00a0spectra\u00a0 (2339\u00a0cm\u22121)\u00a0shifts\u00a0for\u00a0~10\u00a0cm\u22121\u00a0in\u00a0comparison\u00a0to\u00a0free\u00a0carbon\u00a0dioxide\u00a0in\u00a0a\u00a0gas\u00a0phase\u00a0(2349\u00a0 cm\u22121),\u00a0which\u00a0confirms\u00a0the\u00a0emergence\u00a0of\u00a0interaction\u00a0between\u00a0CO2\u00a0and\u00a0PILs.\u00a0A\u00a0small\u00a0value\u00a0 of\u00a0shift\u00a0is\u00a0in\u00a0favor\u00a0of\u00a0a\u00a0physical\u00a0nature\u00a0of\u00a0interaction\u00a0and\u00a0not\u00a0chemical.\u00a0The\u00a0disappearance\u00a0 of\u00a0the\u00a0\u03bd3\u00a0CO2\u00a0band\u00a0caused\u00a0by\u00a0the\u00a0quick\u00a0desorption\u00a0during\u00a0vacuum\u00a0treatment\u00a0without\u00a0a\u00a0\ne branes\u00a02023,\u00a013,\u00a0x\u00a0F \u00a0PEE \u00a0 E IE \u00a0 9\u00a0 of\u00a0 19\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\na \u00a0i \u00a0 i res\u00a0 1\u2013 6\u00a0f r\u00a0 - I .\u00a0 - I \u00a0s ectra\u00a0f r\u00a0 I s\u00a0c tai i \u00a0 f2 \u00a0a i \u00a0are\u00a0 re rese te \u00a0i \u00a0 i res\u00a02\u00a0a \u00a03.\u00a0 fter\u00a0e s re\u00a0t \u00a0t e\u00a0 2\u00a0at s ere,\u00a0a\u00a0str \u00a0 2\u00a0as - etric\u00a0stretc \u00a0( 3)\u00a0 \u00a0is\u00a0 ser e \u00a0f r\u00a0 I \u00a0s ectra\u00a0i \u00a0t e\u00a0re i \u00a02333\u20132341\u00a0c \u22121.\u00a0 \u00a0\nFig re\u00a02.\u00a0F I \u00a0s ectra\u00a0of\u00a0 re\u00a0 i f2 ,\u00a0 i f2 \u00a0after\u00a0 2\u00a0a sor tio ,\u00a0a \u00a0 i f2 \u00a0\nafter\u00a0 2\u00a0 esor tio .\u00a0\nFig re\u00a03.\u00a0F I \u00a0s ectra\u00a0of\u00a0 re\u00a0 y f2 ,\u00a0 y f2 \u00a0after\u00a0 2\u00a0a sor tio ,\u00a0a \u00a0 y f2 \u00a0after\u00a0\n2\u00a0 esor tio .\u00a0\na le\u00a05\u00a0c ares\u00a0 t e\u00a0 siti \u00a0 f\u00a0 t e\u00a0 3\u00a0 2\u00a0 \u00a0after\u00a0 i teracti \u00a0 it \u00a0 I s\u00a0 it \u00a0 t se\u00a0 f\u00a0free\u00a0 2\u00a0 f\u00a0s li \u00a0a \u00a0 as\u00a0states.\u00a0It\u00a0is\u00a0 rt \u00a0 ti \u00a0t at\u00a0 3\u00a0 2\u00a0i \u00a0t e\u00a0 I s\u00a0s ectra\u00a0 (2339\u00a0c \u22121)\u00a0s ifts\u00a0f r\u00a0~10\u00a0c \u22121\u00a0i \u00a0c aris \u00a0t \u00a0free\u00a0car \u00a0 i i e\u00a0i \u00a0a\u00a0 as\u00a0 ase\u00a0(2349\u00a0 c \u22121),\u00a0 ic \u00a0c r s\u00a0t e\u00a0e er e ce\u00a0 f\u00a0i teracti \u00a0 et ee \u00a0 2\u00a0a \u00a0 I s.\u00a0 \u00a0s all\u00a0 al e\u00a0 f\u00a0s ift\u00a0is\u00a0i \u00a0fa r\u00a0 f\u00a0a\u00a0 sical\u00a0 at re\u00a0 f\u00a0i teracti \u00a0a \u00a0 t\u00a0c e ical.\u00a0 e\u00a0 isa eara ce\u00a0 f\u00a0t e\u00a0 3\u00a0 2\u00a0 a \u00a0ca se \u00a0 \u00a0t e\u00a0 ic \u00a0 es r ti \u00a0 ri \u00a0 ac \u00a0treat e t\u00a0 it t\u00a0a\u00a0\nTable 5 compares the position of the \u03bd3 CO2 bond after interaction with PILs with those of free CO2 of solid and gas states. It is worth noting that \u03bd3 CO2 in the PILs spectra (2339 cm\u22121) shifts for ~10 cm\u22121 in comparison to free carbon dioxide in a gas phase (2349 cm\u22121), which confirms the emergence of interaction between CO2 and PILs. A small value of shift is in favor of a physical nature of interaction and not chemical. The disappearance of the \u03bd3 CO2 band caused by the quick desorption during vacuum treatment without a temperature increase is in the line with abovementioned observations. Thus, it could be concluded that the interaction between carbon dioxide and PILs is that of a physisorption type. However, ILs with Tf2N and carboxylate anion demonstrate chemosorption of CO2 [56,58]. The position of the bond varies depending on the nature\nMembranes 2023, 13, 539 10 of 18\nof the anion in polyelectrolyte. The frequency of the \u03bd3 CO2 band demonstrates the most significant shift (14 cm\u22121) when PILs with Cl-anion are considered. Apparently, it proceeds due to the higher polarizing effect of small Cl-anion in comparison to other investigated anions with a larger radius. In the case of gas separation membranes, weaker interaction is preferable because it provides faster sorption\u2013desorption acts in a mass-transfer process acting by the solution\u2013diffusion mechanism.\n\u00a0\nFigure\u00a04.\u00a0Density\u00a0of\u00a0nonporous\u00a0polymer\u00a0films\u00a0based\u00a0on\u00a0synthesized\u00a0PILs.\u00a0\n3.2.\u00a0Membrane\u00a0Characterization\u00a0 \u00a0 Most\u00a0previously\u00a0reported\u00a0PILs\u00a0are\u00a0characterized\u00a0by\u00a0low\u00a0breaking\u00a0strength\u00a0and\u00a0high\u00a0 fragility\u00a0[28,42,46,51].\u00a0This\u00a0drawback\u00a0could\u00a0be\u00a0solved\u00a0by\u00a0developing\u00a0a\u00a0composite\u00a0membrane\u00a0with\u00a0a\u00a0porous\u00a0support\u00a0providing\u00a0the\u00a0required\u00a0mechanical\u00a0strength.\u00a0Thereby,\u00a0composite\u00a0membranes\u00a0composed\u00a0of\u00a0porous\u00a0fluoropolymer\u00a0support\u00a0and\u00a0a\u00a0thin\u00a0selective\u00a0layer\u00a0 based\u00a0on\u00a0a\u00a0synthesized\u00a0polymers\u00a0were\u00a0developed.\u00a0Membrane\u00a0cross-sectional\u00a0microstructure\u00a0and\u00a0surface\u00a0topography\u00a0registered\u00a0by\u00a0SEM\u00a0are\u00a0shown\u00a0in\u00a0Figures\u00a05\u00a0and\u00a06.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\n(a)\u00a0 (b)\u00a0\nFigure\u00a05.\u00a0SEM\u00a0microphotographs\u00a0of\u00a0pVBCl/MFFK\u00a0cross-section\u00a0(a)\u00a0and\u00a0surface\u00a0(b).\u00a0\nMembranes 2023, 13, 539 11 of 18"

Layers (ii) and (iii) belong to the commercial microfiltration membrane used as a support. PILs demonstrate good adhesion to the fluoroplastic layer. Penetration of PILs into the porous of the support is not observed. The values of selective layer thickness obtained from SEM cross-sectional microphotographs were used to calculate permeability coefficients for each PIL. The average thickness is about 50 micrometers, which is several times higher than in advanced reverse osmosis or pervaporation membranes. In this case, thick selective layer prevents mechanical defects that drastically influence membranes performance. Another way to provide mechanically stability to a thin PIL layer is mixing with compatible IL [63]. The obtained PILs form a homogeneous defect-free layer on the surface of porous fluoroplastic support. Comparison of SEM microphotographs of the surface for the initial pVBCl (Figure 5) with PILs (Figure 6) shows conformity. The flexible pVBCl backbone structure determines the appearance of the PIL surface in this case. Densely packed polymeric chains form uniform amorphous structures. Despite the PILs\u2019 selective layers having a similar topography, the nature of ionic substitute in a polymer significantly influences the energetic characteristics of the membrane surface. The surface free energy and its polar and dispersive components were evaluated using the Owens\u2013Wendt method based on wettability measurements. The results are shown in Figure 7.

Due to the a i ilic t r f I s, t s rfaces of composite membranes are well wetted by the nonpolar test liquid diiodomethane as well as by water and glycerol; however, there are some differences in wettability as a result of different surface free energy, depending\nMembranes 2023, 13, 539 13 of 18\non the nature of the tertiary amine and counter ion. As was shown by Bogdanova and Dolzhikov [64] for glassy polymers the dispersive component is linearly correlated with the free volume of the polymer since both values are impacted by the density of pacing in the polymer matrix. The results of dispersive energy component calculation support the previously discussed results of the density measurements. The dispersive energy changes the same way as the density of PILs and follow the order: Tf2N\u2212 < BF4\u2212 < PF6\u2212. The polar component of surface free energy is slightly lower for polycations with Tf2N\u2212 counter ion in comparison to other PILs. Overall, the results demonstrate that polycationic PIL surface free energy is insignificantly altered by the type of tertiary amine in the polymer structure and, to a greater extent, depends on the nature of the anion. The density of the polymer and its surface properties are in a close correlation with gas transport properties. According to the results of density measurements and surface free energy calculations, a greater permeability of Tf2N\u2212-containing PILs was expected and confirmed experimentally. The permeability coefficients of the obtained membranes are represented in Figure 8.

In this study, the design and performance of composite membranes based on imidazolium and pyridinium polycationic salts with different anions, such as hexafluorophosphate, tetrafluoroborate, and bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, were investigated. PILs were synthesized using a simple ion exchange reaction from a basic polymer precursor, pVBCl. It was found that the functionalization degree and anion exchange degree depend on the nature of substitute. The formation of PILs was confirmed by a combination of NMR and ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. ATR-FTIR was also used to characterize PILs interaction with CO2. Several studies [56,58] have previously reported chemosorption of CO2 by ILs containing Tf2N and carboxylate anions. Spectroscopic data on PILs interaction with CO2 is more in favor of physisorption in the case of polymerized ionic liquids. Properties of the synthetized PILs and gas separation properties of PIL-based composite membranes are summarized in Table 6.\n* \u201c-\u201d\u2014was not measured.\nIn general, PILs showed properties comparable to the previously reported (Table 1) properties and could be further investigated as a membrane matrix material. PILs that contain Tf2N\u2212 anions exhibited superior separation performance compared to other polymers. The further investigation of pVBCl-based gas separation membranes could be focused on, combining polycations with carboxylate anions that also show a good CO2 absorption [56,58], as well as the influence of water presence on the membrane performance.\nMembranes 2023, 13, 539 15 of 18\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/membranes13060539/s1, Figure S1: ATR-FTIR spectra for pVBmimCl, Figure S2: ATR-FTIR spectra for pVBmimBF4, Figure S3: ATR-FTIR spectra for pVBmimPF6, Figure S4: ATR-FTIR spectra for pVBPyCl, Figure S5: ATR-FTIR spectra for pVBPyBF4, Figure S6: ATR-FTIR spectra for pVBPyPF6, Figure S7: The time course of CO2 pressure in permeation cell for a membrane with pVBmimTf2N selective layer; Table S1: Mixtures of liquids used for PILs density evaluation, Table S2: NMR data, Table S3: Supplementary Information for SEM images\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, K.V.O. and O.V.K.; methodology, A.N.P. and A.V.V.; software, A.A.A. and A.A.K.; validation, K.V.O. and S.S.S.; formal analysis, D.G.F., Y.B.M. and A.V.B.; investigation, K.V.O., A.A.M., I.D.Z. and E.S.D.; resources, I.V.V.; data curation, K.V.O.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, K.V.O.; writing\u2014review and editing, O.V.K.; visualization, T.S.S.; supervision, O.V.K.; project administration, I.V.V.; funding acquisition, O.V.K.
