    "abstractText": "Because of serious electromagnetic pollution caused by the widespread use of radio frequency equipment, the study of electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials has been a long-standing topic. Carbon fiber and graphene composites have great potential as EMI shielding materials due to their unique microstructure and electrical conductivity. In this work, a novel kind of core-shell composite is fabricated based on the pore-rich pine needles-derived carbon fibers (coded as PNCFs) core and the graphene shell. The pore-rich PNCFs are created by KOH activation, and the integration between the pore-rich PNCFs and the graphene relies on a plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) method. The conductivity of the pore-rich PNCFs@graphene core-shell composite reaches 4.97 S cm\u22121, and the composite has an excellent EMI shielding effectiveness (SE > 70 dB over X-band (8.2\u201312.4 GHz)) and achieves a maximum value of ~77 dB at 10.4 GHz, which is higher than many biobased EMI shielding materials in the recent literature. By calculation and comparison, the large absorption loss (accounting for 90.8% of total loss) contributes to reducing secondary radiation, which is quite beneficial for stealth uses. Thus, this work demonstrates a promising design method for the preparation of green high-performance composites for EMI shielding and stealth applications (such as warcrafts, missiles, and stealth wears).",

            "text": "With the rapid development of electronic information technology, radio frequency equipment has been widely used in various fields such as communications, biological medicine, and remote sensing. Radio frequency equipment brings us convenience, but it also brings serious electromagnetic pollution. Electromagnetic pollution will not only disturb the normal operation of precision instruments, but also cause harm to people\u2019s health. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop high-performance electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials [1\u20134]. EMI shielding materials can be roughly divided into three categories: carbon materials, metals, and conductive polymers. Among them, carbon materials have suitable electrical conductivity, strong oxidation resistance, and superior thermal stability. They are quite suitable for electromagnetic shielding materials. As people\u2019s awareness of environmental protection continues to increase, more and more attention has been paid to green chemistry and materials [5,6]. Graphite and petroleum coke-derived carbon materials are non-renewable and contaminated. Biomass, including renewable crops or animals, can be considered an environmentally friendly precursor that can be sustainably produced on a large scale and at low prices. Moreover, due to its structural diversity and tunable physical/chemical properties, biomass can be formed into specific porous and layered carbon\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 174. https://doi.org/10.3390/nano13010174 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 174 2 of 19\nmaterials by simple methods [7,8]. In recent years, biomass-derived carbon materials have been widely used for electrochemical energy storage [9,10], catalytic adsorption [11], and biosensing [12], but the development of biomass-based derived carbon for electromagnetic shielding materials is still in the early stage. For example, Shen et al. [13] prepared aerogel (Cs)/epoxy EMI shielding composites by carbonizing natural wood to obtain Cs and then backfilling them with epoxy resin to achieve an electromagnetic shielding effectiveness of 28 dB at X-band. Li et al. [14] prepared the aerogel-like carbon (ALC) based on sugarcane, and the average EMI shielding effectiveness of ALC in the X-band is 51 dB. Zhang et al. [15] employed the cotton fabric as the skeleton, and the polyethyleneimine/phytic acid (PEI/PA) layer and silver nanowires (AgNWs) conductive networks are formed on the surface of cotton fibers through layer-by-layer assembled technology and the dip-coating method. The strong electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding effect play key roles in their interface bonding. This kind of multilayer-coated cotton fabric is flame-retardant and has an EMI shielding effectiveness of 32.98 dB in the X-band. Pine trees are widely distributed throughout the world due to their environmental adaptability, while pine needles exhibit a rich stratification of pores. In most cases, the dropped pine needles are discarded and decay into the soil. There is evidence that pine needle-derived porous carbon has excellent electromagnetic wave absorption properties [16]. Further studies on the electromagnetic shielding properties of pine needle-derived carbon are necessary. Meanwhile, carbon nanomaterials (carbon fibers, carbon nanotubes, graphene, etc.) have attracted the interest of outstanding scholars in different fields in the past few years due to their superior various performance. For example, Zhang et al. [17] prepared selfsupporting x Ni-WC@CFP catalysts with fold-like structures using carbon fiber paper (CFP) as the carbon source by a one-step molten salt method. This Ni-doped WC-based selfsupporting electrocatalyst exhibited excellent catalytic performance for efficient hydrogen production on the CFP surface by taking advantage of properties such as high specific area and high conductivity of CFP. Luo et al. [18] recently reported a new type of stretchable polymer carbon nanotube (CNF) composite electrode. Due to the excellent electrical and mechanical properties of CNF, the composite electrodes embedded with long CNF not only form an excellent conductive network (low sheet resistance of 30\u223c50 \u2126/sq) but also have suitable tensile properties (recoverable stretching rate up to 200%) and excellent stability (over 20,000 bending and stretching cycles). The excellent work of A. Mohammadnejad et al. [19] also showed that CNT has a significant positive effect on Ni structure and mechanical properties. The authors demonstrate that the introduction of CNT can cause lattice deformation of the alloy and simplify the diffusion of alloying elements, which can accelerate the sintering kinetics. It was also demonstrated that the addition of CNT could improve the hardness and ductility of the alloy. Graphene, one of the most basic elements of carbon materials, has a perfect hybrid structure and a large conjugated system whose \u03c0-electron network can offer suitable conductive channels and reaches fast electron mobility at room temperature of 15,000 cm2 V\u22121 S\u22121 [20\u201323]. As a result, graphene has aroused great interest in the field of EMI shielding. It is believed that combining graphene with other EMI shielding active materials can realize a striking EMI shielding effectiveness because of the synergistic effects between them. In addition, developing a smart 3D structure has been demonstrated as a portal factor for the improvement of EMI shielding effectiveness due to the reinforced multiple reflection effects in the complex micro-nano structure. Xu et al. [24]. Silkworm cocoon\u2013co-graphene (SC-Co-G) composites were prepared using cocoons as precursors of biomass carbon, which exhibited a maximum electrical conductivity of about 0.22 S cm\u22121 and electromagnetic shielding effectiveness is 55.0 dB at 12.4\u201318 GHz. The porous structure will greatly increase the specific surface area of the materials, and the specific surface area of the shielding materials is also a key parameter that affects the EMI shielding performance. For instance, Chen et al. [25] prepared a graphene@polydimethylsiloxane composite three-dimensional porous material using a three-dimensional nickel foam template. Graphene formed a three-dimensional conductive path. When the thickness of the composite is 2 mm or 3 mm, their EMI shielding\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 174 3 of 19\neffectiveness is 26~27 dB or 36~37 dB, respectively. Moreover, in our recent work [26], we have successfully constructed a sandwich nano heterostructure composed of carbon fibers, metallic nickel nanoparticles, and dandelion-like graphene. This top-down structural design method enhances the electromagnetic shielding effect of the material with the help of the micro-nano structural characteristics and synergy of these three components, and the final X-band electromagnetic shielding effectiveness reaches 50.6 dB. This work also proved that graphene nanosheets and carbon fibers can construct a dense conductive network and supply many mobile charge carriers and conductive channels. The electromagnetic shielding effectiveness of the 2-mm-thick composite in the X-band is as high as 58.4 dB. However, it is still meaningful to further construct a new smart nanostructure of graphenebased hybrid materials for the development of high-performance EMI shielding products. Herein, we use pine needles as raw materials and carbonize them into carbon fibers (coded as PNCFs) to integrate with graphene after an activation treatment. The activation treatment is conducted by a combined process of KOH immersion and calcination. The growth of graphene is carried out on the surface of pore-rich PNCFs by virtue of plasmaenhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) [27,28]. Figure 1 depicts the preparation process of the pore-rich PNCFs@graphene core-shell composite. This core-shell composite can achieve a maximum EMI shielding effectiveness of ~77 dB in the X-band, higher than its precursor (pore-rich PNCFs, 52 dB). Moreover, the absorption shielding effectiveness (SEA) and reflection shielding effectiveness (SER) of the pore-rich PNCFs@graphene account for 90.8% and 9.2% of the total effectiveness, respectively, revealing an absorption-dominate EMI shielding mechanism. In addition, a possible mechanism analysis on the EMI shielding process is proposed.\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 20\neffectiveness is 55.0 dB at 12.4\u201318 GHz.

First, 50 mL of KOH solution was used to soak the PNCFs for 24 h (the mass ratio of PNCFs to KOH is 1:4). After being dried at 105 \u25e6C to remove moisture, the PNCFs and powder-like KOH were transferred to a nickel ark for heat treatment. The temperature was first raised from room temperature to 800 \u25e6C at a heating rate of 10 \u25e6C min\u22121 under the protection of argon gas (flow rate 250 scc/min) and then kept at 800 \u25e6C for 5 h. After that, the sample was naturally cooled to room temperature. Then the sample was washed with 10% HCl until the pH value approached 7. Then the sample was dried at 60 \u25e6C. The activation mechanism using KOH as the activator can be described as follow. During the heating process, the KOH crystallizes into small particles and intercalates into PNCFs. When the temperature rises to 800 \u25e6C, the activator KOH reacts with PNCFs, leading to the production of K2CO3, K2O, etc. Subsequently, these products further react with PNCFs. These reactions not only produce abundant new micropores but also enlarge the specific surface area [29].

[30] first proposed the density functional theory (DFT) in 1989, coupled with Monte Carlo (MC) molecular simulations, to calculate pore size distribution more precisely from adsorption isotherms. The DFT allows for the description of the adsorption and phase behavior of fluids in pores at the molecular level and obtains an accurate pore size distribution over the complete micro- and mesopore range. DFT provides a microscopic model of adsorption, which reflects pore size distribution more accurately than traditional thermodynamic methods (including BJH, HK, and SF).\n2.7.1. Adsorption Experiment\nThe pore structure and surface area were analyzed by N2 adsorption\u2013desorption tests using an accelerated surface area and porosimeter system (3H-2000PS2 unit, Beishide Instrument S&T Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) at 77.4 K. High-purity nitrogen (99.99%) was used. Sample density was controlled at 1.000 g/cm3. All samples were degassed at 300 \u25e6C for 2 h prior to measurements.\n2.7.2. DFT Calculation Method\nThe International Organization for Standardization (ISO) recommends the use of DFT to calculate the pore size distribution [31]. The theory relies on the pore size distribution fundamental relationship with the experimental adsorption isotherm, V, given in the form of the following adsorption integral equation [32]:\nV(p) = \u222b \u03b2 \u03b1 \u03c1(p, w) f (w)dw (4)\nwhere V(p) denotes the volume adsorbed as a function of pressure, and \u03c1(p, w) is the model adsorption isotherm given in terms of the adsorbate density calculated for model pores as a function of pore width (w) and equilibrium pressure (p). The pore size distribution, f (w), is the distribution of pore volumes as a function of pore width. The lower and upper limit of the integration range are the widths of the smallest and largest pores (where the pore width is the distance between the nuclei of C atoms on opposing pore walls) [33]. In this approach, the individual pore model isotherm \u03c1(p,w) comes from the molecular model for nitrogen adsorption on the basis of nonlocal or smoothed density approximation, and it is also the kernel file in the DFT software we use. In this study, the DFT pore distribution model was calculated by using the ASIQwin software released by Quantachrome Instruments (Boynton Beach, FL, USA), and the model (kernel) \u201cN2@77K on carbon materials (slit-shaped/spherical pores, NLDFT method, calculated using desorption curves)\u201d was selected."

As shown in Figure 2a,b, the pyrolysis treatment transforms the rough surface of pine needles to the smooth surface of PNCFs. The surface color of pine needles changes from green to black, revealing the formation of carbon components. After the activation treatment, the surface of PNCFs becomes rough again (Figure 2c), and the surface of pore-rich PNCFs becomes rougher after the growth of graphene by PECVD (Figure 2d). As can be seen from Figure 2e\u2013g, under higher magnification of SEM images, there are no micropores on the surface of the original pine needles and PNCFs. The surface of PNCFs that has undergone pore formation treatment is covered with uniformly distributed micropores. After depositing graphene using PECVD on the pore-rich PNCFs substrate for 60 min, the surface of the pore-rich PNCFs is covered with a film containing graphene nanosheets, as shown in Figure 2h. Therefore, a binary core-shell structure pore-rich PNCFs@graphene is created. Studies have shown that the junction interface and defects between two different nano-carbons can cause charge delocalization that will favor the attenuation of electromagnetic energy [35,36]. In addition, for heterogeneous and concentric nanomaterials, their activity is higher than the activity of their individual components [37,38].

Therefore, the graphene shell can effectively shield electromagnetic waves.\nTo further study the microstructure of composite, the crystal structure of the porerich PNCFs and pore-rich PNCFs@graphene are monitored by XRD (Figure 4a). The XRD patterns for the pore-rich PNCFs and pore-rich PNCFs@graphene consist of two broad peaks positioned at 2\u03b8 = ~23.2\u00b0 and 43.4\u00b0, which correspond to the (002) and (100) planes of carbon structure, respectively. By comparing the XRD patterns of pore-rich PNCFs and pore-rich PNCFs@graphene, both XRD patterns show a distinct amorphous carbon structure, and the relatively intact crystal structure of graphene after growing graphene by PECVD causes the carbon (002) and (100) peaks in pore-rich PNCFs@graphene to become narrower and sharper [35,39].

The high ID/IG value of the pore-rich PNCFs@graphene composite reveals a large disorder/defect density. The residual defects/groups of graphene may be beneficial for the electromagnetic wave absorption of the pore-rich PNCFs@graphene core-shell composite.\nThe large surface area of the conductor is conducive to enhancing the interaction effect between it and electromagnetic waves, so the surface area of the shielding material has been proven to be a key parameter that affects the performance of EMI shielding [42]. The surface area and porosity of pine needles, PNCFs, pore-rich PNCFs, and pore-rich PNCFs@graphene composite have been determined using the BET method. Through the pyrolysis process, the BET surface area increases from 3.0 m2 g\u22121 (pine needles) to 333.2 m2 g\u22121 (PNCFs). A combined method of KOH immersion and calcination was used to make pores for PNCFs, and the introduction of graphene by PECVD is to make the surface of PNCFs rougher, thus further increasing the specific surface area of the material. The specific surface area of the material increases from 333.2 m2 g\u22121 (PNCFs) to 498.1 m2 g\u22121 (porerich PNCFs) and eventually to 699.1 m2 g\u22121 (pore-rich PNCFs@graphene) (Table 1). Larger surface area and interface space provide more sites for electromagnetic wave scattering and multiple reflections. Nanomaterials with a larger specific area are expected to possess more superior ability to attenuate electromagnetic waves because there are more nanoparticles to be polarized to cause magnetic domain resonance and eddy loss as well as electric-thermal conversion loss when electromagnetic waves penetrate the materials. It is expected that such a high surface area of pore-rich PNCFs@graphene is effective for the attenuation of electromagnetic waves [43,44].\ni f t e crystal structure, chemical composit on, and pore structure of the pore- ich site: (a) XRD patterns; (b) Raman spectra; (c) N2 adsorption\u2013desorption\nisother s; ( ) FT odel incremental pore volume vs. pore width.\nl f f t c t is conduci e to enhancing the interaction effect between it and electro a etic a es, s the surface area of the shielding material has been proven to be a key parameter that affects the performance of EMI shielding [42].

It is expected that such a high surface area of pore-rich PNCFs@graphene is effective for the attenuation of electroma netic waves [43,44].\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 174 10 of 19\nFrom the N2 adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms (Figure 4c), the original pine needles almost have no adsorption capacity. By comparison, other materials, including PNCFs, pore-rich PNCFs, and pore-rich PNCFs@graphene, exhibit remarkable uptakes in the P/P0 range of 0\u20130.2, revealing the presence of micropores [45]. The appearance of hysteresis loops suggests the existence of mesopores [46]. The DFT model illustrates the incremental contribution of different pore sizes to pore volume, so we can infer the different pore width distributions of the material (Figure 4d). We can find that pore-rich PNCFs@graphene displays clearly stronger peak intensities compared to others. Meanwhile, the graphene grown in PECVD itself has defects ranging from sub-nanometers to several nanometers, and during the growth process, the interconnection and accumulation between graphene sheets and lamellar form pores composed of single or several layers of graphene sheets, all of which lead to wider pore distribution in the richly porous PNCFs@graphene. In addition, by comparing the brown line (pore-rich PNCFs) and the blue line (PNCFs), the peak intensity in the region of micropores increases while that in the region of mesopores and macropores decreases, suggesting that some mesopores and macropores are possibly transformed into micropores after the KOH activation treatment. The calculated average pore size decreases from 6.55 nm (the calculated average pore size) to 2.20 nm (pore-rich PNCFs) when the calculated total pore volume increases from 0.17 cm3 g\u22121 (PNCFs) to 0.22 cm3 g\u22121 (pore-rich PNCFs) after pore formation (Table 1). The phenomena are associated with the formation of a large number of micropores by the pore formation treatment. Moreover, the graphene growth increases the total pore volume from 0.22 cm3 g\u22121 (pore-rich PNCFs) by 1.8 times to 0.40 cm3 g\u22121 (pore-rich PNCFs@graphene). This is related to the growth of graphene films and the formation of core-shell structures. Thus, the final pore-rich PNCFs@graphene has a suitable porous structure. The enhancement of the surface area and pore volume of pore-rich PNCFs@graphene and its close impedance matching with free space may accelerate the incident electromagnetic waves entering the composite material. The existence of pores in the pore-rich PNCFs@graphene can also provide channels for the penetration and transmission of electromagnetic waves to promote multiple scattering, thus further increasing the attenuation of electromagnetic waves in the composite [47]. The porous structure of pore-rich PNCFs@graphene also shows that it can be used as a lightweight EMI shielding material."

            "text": "Theoretically, for plane waves propagating to the material surface, they will be reflected and absorbed. The remaining electromagnetic wave will penetrate the material and cause multiple reflections inside the material, thereby inducing further dissipation of electromagnetic wave energy. The EMI shielding property is measured by the EMI SE, which is expressed using decibels (dB) as a unit. As electromagnetic waves propagate to the surface of the material, part of the incident power (PI) will be reflected, part of the energy will be absorbed and dissipated, and the rest (PT) will pass through the shielding material [48]. The SET is equal to the sum of electromagnetic wave reflection SER, electromagnetic wave absorption SEA, and electromagnetic wave internal multiple reflection loss (SEM), expressed as:\nSET = 10log PI PT = SER + SEA + SEM (11)\nSEA = 20loged/\u03b4 \u2248 8.7d \u221a f \u03c0\u00b5\u03c3 (12)\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 174 11 of 19\nSER \u2248 39.5 + 10log \u03c3\n2 f \u03c0\u00b5 (13)\nSEM = 20log ( 1\u2212 e\u2212 2d \u03b4 ) (14)\nwhere \u03c3 means the conductivity of the shielding material, \u00b5 is the relative permeability of the shielding material, f is the frequency of a certain frequency point, d represents the thickness of the shielding material, and \u03c3 represents the skin depth of the material. Reflection loss and absorption loss are the two main mechanisms of electromagnetic shielding. The internal multiple reflection loss is the electromagnetic radiation trapped between the two boundaries of the material; that is, the electromagnetic wave reflected from the second boundary returns to the first boundary, and continues to reflect from the first boundary to the second boundary, and so on. The larger surface area of the porous structure and the larger surface-interface space contribute to providing more sites for electromagnetic wave scattering and multiple reflections. To acquire more reflected waves, shielding materials must possess abundant load carriers (electrons and holes) to interact with each other. According to electromagnetic shielding theory, SEA and SER are the main ways of electromagnetic shielding. Both SEA and SER are proportional to the conductivity of the material. So the electrical conductivity is tightly responsible for the EMI shielding property. As the conductivity increases, the ability of the material to lose the incident radiation increases. According to the free electric theory, the electrical conductivity \u03c3r in an alternating electric field could be evaluated by the following Equation (15):\n\u03c3r \u2248 2\u03c0 f \u03b50\u03b5\u2032\u2032 (15)\nwhere f is frequency, \u03b50 is the permittivity of free space (\u03b50 = 8.854 \u00d7 10\u221212 F/m), and \u03b5\u201d is the imaginary permittivity [49,50]. The electrical conductivity of the PNCFs, pore-rich PNCFs, and pore-rich PNCFs@graphene are depicted in Figure 5. The electrical conductivity of the PNCFs that are pyrolyzed from the pine needle product reaches 1.13 S cm\u22121, and the conductivity of the pore-rich PNCFs rises to 1.57 S cm\u22121. The difference between them is mainly attributed to the construction of conductive networks. The conductive networks promote the movement of charge carriers and provide more pathways for the transport of electrons in the pore-rich PNCFs, thereby improving the electrical conductivity of pore-rich PNCFs. The unique graphene \u201cshell\u201d in the composite is very important in improving conductivity. Due to the high conductivity of the graphene shell in the pore-rich PNCFs@graphene, the pore-rich PNCFs@graphene reaches 4.97 S cm\u22121 at 8.2 GHz, 216.6% higher than that of the pore-rich PNCFs (1.57 S cm\u22121). High electrical conductivity facilitates the efficient mobilization of charge carriers in the pore-rich PNCFs@graphene, which leads to the promotion dissipation of incident electromagnetic waves on the surface of the core-shell composite and improves the EMI SE of the composite. To investigate the EMI shielding property of the pore-rich PNCFs@graphene, the composite is tested in the frequency range of 8.2\u201312.4 GHz (X-band, a quite common band for military and communication, such as radar, telephones, and TVs). Generally, the total EMI shielding effectiveness (SET) is the summation of all attenuating functions. The pine needles present an extremely low SET value, indicating that pine needles almost have no EMI shielding ability. By contrast, the PNCFs deliver a much higher SET maximum value of ~36 dB. The maximum value of SET rises to ~52 dB for the pore-rich PNCFs. As the graphene is introduced, the maximum value of SET increases to ~77 dB for the pore-rich PNCFs@graphene (Figure 6a). Such a high EMI SE proves the excellent effect of this unique core-shell and porous structure pore-rich PNCFs@graphene composite on electromagnetic shielding. The possible shielding mechanism is shown in Figure 6b. In addition, this high SE is superior to that of many recently reported biomass-based EMI shielding products, such as the Cs/epoxy (28 dB) [14], PEI/PA@AgNWs (32.9 dB) [16], honeycomblike lignin-based carbon/graphene foams (28.5\u201370.5 dB) [51], loofah sponge-derived carbon/paraffin/urethane (32 dB) [52], epoxy/CNT sponge (33 dB) [53], Fe3O4@reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/natural rubber (37 dB) [54], rGO/polystyrene (45.1 dB) [55], multi-\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 174 12 of 19\nwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT)/water-borne polyurethane (49.2 dB) [56], ALC based on sugarcane (51 dB) [15], SC-Co-G (55 dB) [21], and cotton fiber-derived carbon/CoFe alloy (~62 dB) [57], as summarized in Table 2. To study the effect of structural damages of the carbonized needles on the EMI shielding property, we blended the powder-like pore-rich PNCFs@graphene sample with paraffin, and the sample shows a similar EMI SE value, as compared to that of the sample based on non-grinding pore-rich PNCFs@graphene. The maximum difference between them is only 2 dB (Figure 6a). Therefore, the common physical treatment (such as grinding) on the carbonized needles will not notably affect the EMI shielding property.

The SET, SER, and SEA values of the PNCFs, pore-rich PNCFs, and pore-rich PNCFs@graphene are presented in Figure 7a\u2013c. With the formation of porous and core-shell structure, the maximum A increases from 83.6% for PNCFs to 85.8% for the pore-rich PNCFs and eventually to 90.8% for the porerich PNCFs@graphene (Figure 7d), shows absorption-dominating shielding mechanism. The maximum A of the pore-rich PNCFs@graphene in this work is 90.8%, which is much higher than the maximum value of other shielding materials in the X-band [60,61]. Clearly, combining Equations (7)\u2013(9), the growth of A is due to \u03c3AC, and \u03c3AC is clearly attributed to graphene. This core-shell structure with graphene as the shell introduces an interface with impedance mismatch, and the multilayer nanostructure provides a new reflection interface for electromagnetic waves so that electromagnetic waves are first dissipated on the surface of the graphene shell. The incoming electromagnetic wave is trapped in the porous structure and attenuated by the absorption and multiple reflections between the\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 174 14 of 19\ncore and shell in pore-rich PNCFs@graphene. This highly porous structure can significantly enhance internal multi-reflection, and the internal absorption in the pores can be repeatedly used to enhance A. Moreover, due to the larger surface area and surface-interface space of the pore-rich PNCFs@graphene, there are more sites for the scattering and multiple reflections of electromagnetic waves. The remaining electromagnetic waves will produce multiple internal reflections in the porous structure of the pore-rich PNCFs@graphene, which will cause the electromagnetic energy to be further dissipated and scattered until most of the electromagnetic waves are absorbed. In addition, the porous core-shell structure provides abundant polarization centers, thereby capturing electromagnetic waves and promoting attenuation through additional dielectric loss. Therefore, the higher absorption loss is mainly attributed to the conductive network structure formed by graphene and carbon fibers, a time-varying electromagnetic field-induced current occurs therein, and induced current in the resistance network and converted into heat energy and multiple reflections of electromagnetic waves in the porous structure, resulting in the rapid decay of electromagnetic waves. In our work, the maximum A of pore-rich PNCFs@graphene reaches 90.8%, which is much higher than that of congeneric porous shielding materials. The absorption-based shielding mechanism contributes to stealth applications (such as warcrafts, missiles, and stealth wears). Nanomaterials 2022, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 15 of 20\nFigure 7.

As seen in Figure 8a, the \u03b5\u2032 decreases with the increase in frequency.

Similarly, the \u03b5\u2033 value improves significantly after the graphene film is grown. The higher permittivity leads to a higher dielectric loss due to the presence of graphene film on the surface of pore-rich PNCFs.

SET, SEA, and SET values of the (a) PNCFs, (b) pore-rich PNCFs, and (c) pore-rich PNCFs@graphene, respectively; (d) the A value of X-band PNCFs, pore-rich PNCFs and pore-rich PNCFs@graphene.\nThe electromagnetic property of the pore-rich PNCFs@graphene is determined by complex permittivity (\u03b5 = \u03b5\u2032 \u2212 i\u03b5\u2033) and permeability (\u03bc = \u03bc\u2032 \u2212 i\u03bc\u2033). The real part of the electromagnetic parameters (\u03b5\u2032, \u03bc\u2032) is a measure of the polarization amount and means the capability for electric or magnetic energy storage, while the imaginary part (\u03b5\u2033, \u03bc\u2033) represents the energy loss ability. As seen in Figure 8a, the \u03b5\u2032 decreases with the increase in frequency. This behavior is raised by the lag of the induced electric field reversed external electric field at high frequency [62]. After the graphene film is grown on the pore-rich PNCFs@graphene surface, the value of \u03b5\u2032 increases obviously. The result indicates the remarkably improved electric energy storage capacity of the composite. Figure 8b shows the imaginary part of the complex permittivity of the PNCFs, porerich PNCFs, and pore-rich PNCFs@graphene. Similarly, the \u03b5\u2033 value improves significantly after the graphene film is grown. The higher permittivity leads to a higher dielectric loss due to the presence of graphene film on the surface of pore-rich PNCFs. In addition, because of the weak magnetic property of carbon materials, the magnetic permeabilities of \u03bc\u2032 and \u03bc\u2033 are very low, almost negligible.\nFigure 8b shows the imaginary part of the complex permittivity of the PNCFs, porerich PNCFs, and pore-rich PNCFs@graphene.

The tensile stressstrain curves of the pure paraffin and paraffin/pore-rich PNCFs@graphene are shown in Figure 9b. The curves and data reveal that the pure paraffin matrix presents distinct plastic characteristics. By calculation, the paraffin/pore-rich PNCFs@graphene shows the tensile modulus, tensile strength, and maximum tensile force of 93.34 MPa, 0.72 MPa, and 13.56 N, respectively. These data are 3.36, 3.79, and 4.54 times those of the paraffin (Figure 9c). The main reason for these increases is the decrease in the amount of lowmolecular-weight paraffin due to the loading of the pore-rich PNCFs@graphene fillers. Paraffin itself has very low tensile strength, and paraffin crystals in the amorphous phase easily act as defect spots for the initiation and propagation of stress cracking. In addition, the high plasticity of paraffin can fill the voids, contributing to the interaction between the pore-rich PNCFs@graphene fillers and the paraffin matrix.

Larger surface area and interface space provide more sites for electromagnetic wave scattering and multiple reflections. \u2022 After the growth of graphene with the help of PECVD, total pore volume increased 1.8-fold from 0.22 cm3 g\u22121 (pore-rich PNCFs) to 0.40 cm3 g\u22121 (pore-rich PNCFs@graphene). This porous structure will facilitate the multiple reflections of the incident electromagnetic waves. \u2022 The generation of conductive networks promoted by the growth of graphene, the as-prepared core-shell structure has a greatly improved conductivity from 1.13 S cm\u22121 (PNCFs) to 4.97 S cm\u22121 (pore-rich PNCFs@graphene). \u2022 Because of the combination of high electrical conductivity and unique core-shell\nporous structure, the PNCFs@graphene composite delivers a high EMI shielding effectiveness of ~77 dB, much higher than its precursors (PNCFs: ~36 dB; pore-rich PNCFs: ~52 dB), respectively.\n\u2022 Due to the enhanced surface area and pore volume of porous PNCFs@graphene to promote the dissipation of electromagnetic waves in the composite, the absorption ratio increases from 83.6% for PNCFs to 85.8% for the pore-rich PNCFs and eventually to 90.8% for the pore-rich PNCFs@graphene. This absorption-based shielding mechanism will have great potential for developing stealth materials.\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 174 17 of 19\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, C.W.; methodology, C.W.; investigation, Y.Y.; resources, C.W.; data curation, Y.Y.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, Y.Y. and C.W.; writing\u2014review and editing, Y.Y.; supervision, Q.H.; project administration, J.H.; funding acquisition, Q.H.
