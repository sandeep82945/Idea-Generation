199 compounds that make up XHP utilizing UPLC-QTOF/MS, including 43 flavonoids, 34 organic acids, 25 esters, 16 saponins, 16 glycosides, 11 ketones, 9 aldehydes, 5 coumarins, and 5 alkaloids. Additionally, the hepatoprotective mechanism of XHP was further investigated by network pharmacology. Among them, 103 targets regulated by 163 chemical XHP components may play an important role in the liver protection effect of XHP. The core targets and their related compounds including Nicotiflorin, Diosmetin, Genkwanin, Naringenin, Formononetin, and Neocnidilide were verified by molecular docking experiments. The eight key targets were further verified by proteomics, which provided a mechanistic insight into the effects of XHP as an ALD treatment. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that XHP exerted protective effects in an animal model of ALD and enriched our knowledge of the chemical constituents and hepatoprotective mechanism of XHP.
