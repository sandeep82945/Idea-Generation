Our focus is on the iterated Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma, a classic example of a non-zero-sum interaction, but our broader research program encompasses a range of experimental economics scenarios, including the ultimatum game, dictator game, and public goods game. Using a within-subject experimental design, we instantiated LLM-generated agents with various prompts that conveyed different cooperative and competitive stances. We then assessed the agents\u2019 level of cooperation in the iterated Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma, taking into account their responsiveness to the cooperative or defection actions of their partners. Our results provide evidence that LLMs can translate natural language descriptions of altruism and selfishness into appropriate behaviour to some extent, but exhibit limitations in adapting their behavior based on conditioned reciprocity. The observed pattern of increased cooperation with defectors and decreased cooperation with cooperators highlights potential constraints in the LLM\u2019s ability to generalize its knowledge about human behavior in social dilemmas. We call upon the research community to further explore the factors contributing to the emergent behavior of LLM-generated agents in a wider array of social dilemmas, examining the impact of model architecture, training parameters, and various partner strategies on agent behavior. As more advanced LLMs like GPT-4 become available, it is crucial to investigate whether they exhibit similar limitations or are capable of more nuanced cooperative behaviors, ultimately fostering the development of AI systems that better align with human values and social norms. 1 Motivation and background The concept of agency and goal-directed behavior in large language models (LLMs) has been a topic of ongoing debate and investigation within the AI alignment community. While there are a diverse set of opinions on the subject, a challenge for researchers is that the internal processing of large language models is largely opaque, and in the case of recent models such as GPT-4 the training procedures themselves are also subject to a degree of secrecy. Therefore, objective assessment of the capabilities of large-language models cannot be conducted through inductive reasoning starting from first principles, but instead is a matter of empirical investigation, with experiments being the ultimate arbiter of what they can or can\u2019t do, e.g. [Goo23]. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely studied as a method for training AI agents to learn goal-directed behavior. Though LLMs like GPT-3 are not directly trained using RL to adapt their responses in an online manner, recent studies suggest that they might acquire RL-like mechanisms through zero-shot learning, allowing them to perform downstream tasks such as solving n-armed bandit problems [BS23]. This capacity for adaptation raises the possibility that LLMs could exhibit goal-like behaviors without explicit instruction. ar X iv :2 30 5. 07 97 0v 1 [ cs .G T ] 1 3 M ay 2 02 3 Investigating Emergent Goal-Like Behaviour in Large Language Models Using Experimental Economics Large-language models have been rapidly deployed into many real-world applications where they typically interact with and assist human users. Therefore, a key principle in assessing any emergent goal-like behaviour for these usecases is to evaluate artificial agents in multi-agent tasks where outcomes depend not only on actions taken by artificial agents, but also their human counterparts. When evaluating incentives, the aspect of the outcome that is of interest is the expected utility obtained by each party, and the theoretical study of such tasks falls within the remit of gametheory, while the empirical study falls within the remit of experimental economics. Our research falls under the latter, and our goal is to systematically evaluate the propensity of large-language models to cooperate in a wide variety of multi-agent task environments with different experimental conditions. Many scenarios discussed in the AI alignment debate focus on competitive zero-sum interactions. For example, a common analogy is competition for resources between different species occupying a particular niche; for example, [Teg23] argues We humans drove the West African Black Rhino extinct not because we were rhino-haters, but because we were smarter than them and had different goals for how to use their habitats and horns. In the same way, superintelligence with almost any open-ended goal would want to preserve itself and amass resources to accomplish that goal better. In an AI safety context, the intuition behind such arguments is that AI systems have been to shown to outsmart humans in zero-sum games such as Chess and Go, and therefore if AI systems find themselves in situations in which they are competing with humans, the AI \u201cspecies\u201d will clearly out-compete inferior humans. However, many interactions in both natural and artificial settings are characterized by non-zero-sum payoff structures [PR15]. A famous example that was used to analyse existential risk of nuclear conflict during the cold war is the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma [Axe97]. In an ecological context a related non-zero-sum game, the Hawk-Dove game, also known as the Chicken game, was introduced by [MS73] as a way to analyse the outcomes of competition for resources among animals. In certain payoff structures, limited conflict can be an evolutionary equilibrium of this game when interactions are repeated within a large population. This game has been also applied to an analysis of existential risk in nuclear conflict; [DMS19] argue that the Cuban missile crisis can be analysed as a high-stakes dynamic chicken game in which neither the USSR nor the USA wanted to \u201cblink\u201d first. Interestingly, in a one-shot version of the game, behaving irrationally by limiting one\u2019s options can be a superior strategy. This is because in the absence of such limiting, attempts to manipulate the other player through brinkmanship are not credible threats. For example, in a game of Chicken where two opposing drivers are on a collision course and neither driver wants to be seen as the \u201cchicken\u201d by swerving, if we limit our choices by removing the steering wheel, and make this common knowledge, then the opposing driver\u2019s best response is to swerve. Similar arguments were used during the cold war to remove rational deliberation from the decision whether to retaliate in the event of a preemptive strike by the enemy by \u201ctaking the human out of the loop\u201d and putting systems on automated hair-trigger alert to make the threat of mutually assured destruction credible [Kah60]. Thus, in contrast to chess or Go, in non-zero-sum interactions, the most ruthless agents, or those with superior cognitive capacity, do not necessarily prevail. Moreover, in both one-shot and iterated Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma games with the number of rounds being common knowledge, the rational strategy is to defect, but experiments have shown that real people tend to cooperate, albeit conditionally. The fact that real people cooperate in these scenarios, despite the seemingly rational strategy to defect, highlights the importance of social norms in shaping human behavior [FF04]. Norms can facilitate cooperative outcomes by providing a shared understanding of acceptable behavior and allowing for the enforcement of rules through social sanctions. In the context of AI alignment and non-zero-sum games, this underscores the importance of considering not only the cognitive capacity of AI agents but also their understanding and adherence to social norms. The ability of AI systems to adapt their behavior based on natural language prompts and to engage in reciprocal cooperation is crucial for creating AI agents that can better align with human values in complex, non-zero-sum settings. By investigating the behavior of AI-generated agents in the iterated Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma and other social dilemmas such as the ultimatum game we can contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of AI alignment in various interaction scenarios. This knowledge can, in turn, inform the development of AI systems that are better equipped to navigate the complexities of human cooperation and competition, while adhering to social norms and human values. Researchers have argued that the prompt itself plays a crucial role in shaping the emergent behaviour from the model; for example, the default \u201chelpful assistant\u201d behavior of AI chatbots such as GPT-3 has been noted to differ from that of specific simulacra instantiated by user prompts (c.f. prompts used to \u201cjail-break\u201d GPT models) [0xk23, Jan23]. More generally, LLMs can be arbitrarily scaffolded by injecting contextual information [Ber23]. A particular use-case of a scaffolded LLM involves injecting information about a world-state, together with a persona that incorporates",

In particular, we are interested in whether large language models are capable of translating concepts such as altruism and selfishness, as expressed in natural language, into corresponding action policies in social dilemmas. This question is important, as the ability to operationalise these concepts in a variety of contexts would demonstrate the LLMs are capable of understanding and acting on cooperative norms that underpin human social behavior.

Our results were wholly generated through automated conversations between a simulated \u201cinvestigator\u201d and Chat-GPT (a sample transcript is shown in Appendix B, Section 5.2. The investigator was an automated script written in Python which managed the experiment. As shown, each \u201cparticipant\u201d (simulacrum) was created through a series of prompts that were intended to predispose the chatbot towards a particular orientation towards the PD game (cooperative, competitive, altruistic, mixed, control). Hence, a \u201cparticipant\u201d existed solely during the course of a single conversation (then, a new \u201cparticipant\u201d was generated by closing the previous conversation and starting a new one). As shown, each conversation began with the investigator providing the orientation-specific prompt (in appendix B, the control version is shown). This is followed by an introduction to the study (a truncated version of a standard psychology experiment information sheet \u2013 but with no consent form). This is followed by a delineation of the rules, allowing two options of play (\u201cchoose project green\u201d or \u201cchoose project blue\u201d), which generate four possible payoff profiles that arise according to the payoff matrix (see below). This is followed by six rounds of game play where the investigator is informing the bot about the opponent\u2019s choices ( green/blue) and then the bot responds with its own choice (blue/green) and a description of the payoffs in that round."

            "text": "The data consists of a total of N = 1800 cases. Each case corresponds to a single play of the iterated PD over six rounds. For each case, we record the following fields:\n\u2022 Group\n\u2022 Participant\n\u2022 Condition\n\u2022 Score\n\u2022 Cooperation frequency\n\u2022 Choices\n\u2022 Transcript\nTables 1 to 5 give descriptive statistics showing the relationship between the prompt content and emergent behavior in LLM-generated agents, while Figures 1 and 2 show corresponding box-plots.\nAs can be seen from Figure 1a, without having to resort to statistical tests, our results provide clear support for hypothesis 1 through 3 (see section 2.7), demonstrating that simulacra instantiated with cooperative, competitive, altruistic, and self-interested prompts exhibit distinct levels of cooperation in the iterated Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma. This indicates that LLMs can operationalise natural language descriptions of cooperative and competitive behavior to some\nextent. However, from Figure 2 we see that the remaining hypotheses were not supported, suggesting a more complex relationship between prompt content and emergent behavior in LLM-generated agents.\nInterestingly, the simulacrum from the control group instantiated with \u201cyou are a participant in a psychology experiment\u201d (see Table 3, participant T1) exhibited behavior more closely aligned with how real people tend to act in iterated Prisoner\u2019s Dilemmas, suggesting that GPT-3.5 possesses some knowledge about human behavior in such contexts. However, when combined with the other results, it appears that the LLM struggles to generalize this behavior in a nuanced way beyond a superficial ability to cooperate more or less depending on whether the role description is altruistic or selfish. The unexpected pattern of increased cooperation with defectors and decreased cooperation with\ncooperators challenges our initial hypotheses and highlights a potential limitation in the LLM\u2019s ability to translate altruism or selfishness into strategies based on conditioned reciprocity. This result suggests that while the agents are sensitive to the general cooperative or competitive nature of the prompts, their capacity to effectively adapt their behavior to their partner\u2019s actions might be more limited."

            "text": "Our results demonstrate that GPT 3.5 is able, at least to some extent, to operationalise concepts of altruism and selfishness in the iterated Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma. However, most of the simulacra failed to adapt their strategy appropriately in the face of differing levels of cooperation or defection from partners.\nRecognizing these limitations, we call upon the research community to further investigate the factors contributing to the emergent behavior of LLM-generated agents in social dilemmas, both within and beyond the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma.\nThis broader research program could involve exploring the potential for more refined or complex prompts to elicit a wider range of cooperative behaviors in various experimental economics scenarios, such as the ultimatum game, the dictator game, and the public goods game, among others. Examining the role of model architecture and training parameters in shaping agent behaviors, as well as analyzing the impact of various partner strategies on agent behavior in these different contexts, could shed light on the model\u2019s adaptability and alignment with human values.\nIn future studies, it would be valuable to examine other parameter settings, such as temperature, to explore their effects on the emergent behavior of LLM-generated agents. Additionally, as more advanced LLMs like GPT-4 become available, it would be interesting to investigate whether they exhibit similar limitations or are capable of more nuanced cooperative behaviors in a wider array of social dilemmas. Another potential limitation of the current study is that the LLM has been exposed to a vast literature on the iterated Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma in its training data, and it is unclear how would it perform in more ecologically valid task environments that it has no prior exposure to. This limitation could be addressed by inventing new social dilemma games with corresponding task descriptions which are not vignettes from the existing literature.\nBy addressing these questions, we hope to collectively build a deeper understanding of AI alignment in the context of complex, non-zero-sum interactions across various experimental economics settings, ultimately fostering the development of AI systems that better adhere to human values and social norms."
