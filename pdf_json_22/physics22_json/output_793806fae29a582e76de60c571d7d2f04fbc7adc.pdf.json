    "abstractText": "The method deriving the L self-absorption spectrum from L\u03b1,\u03b2 emission spectra obtained at different accelerating voltages has been optimized for analyzing the chemical state of Fe in solid materials. Fe L\u03b1,\u03b2 emission spectra obtained are fitted using Pseudo-Voigt functions and normalized by the integrated intensity of each Fe Ll line, which is not affected by L2,3 absorption edge. The self-absorption spectrum is calculated by dividing the normalized intensity profile collected at low accelerating voltage by that collected at a higher accelerating voltage. The obtained profile is referred to as soft X-ray self-absorption structure (SX-SAS). This method is applied to six Fe-based materials (Fe metal, FeO, Fe3O4, Fe2O3, FeS and FeS2) to observe different chemical states of Fe in those materials. By comparing the self-absorption spectra of iron oxides, one can observe the L3 absorption peak structure shows a shift to the higher energy side as ferric (3+) Fe increases with respect to ferrous (+2) Fe. The intensity profiles of self-absorption spectra of metallic Fe and FeS2 shows shoulder structures between the L3 and L2 absorption peaks, which were not observed in spectra of Fe oxides. These results indicate that the SX-SAS technique is useful to examine X-ray absorption structure as a means to understand the chemical states of transition metal elements.",

            "text": "Chemical state analysis using spectral shapes of characteristic X-ray emissions is a widely recognized technique and the method has been conducted mainly using wavelength dispersive (WD) spectrometry on electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA). Recently, a soft X-ray emission spectroscopy (SXES) instrument was developed as a new type of WD spectrometer that can be attached to either an EPMA or scanning electron microscopes (SEM) [1,2]. X-ray dispersion of the SXES instrument uses fixed varied-line-spacing diffraction gratings, which were designed to focus X-rays onto a CCD detector plane in a certain energy range [3\u20135]. The SXES instrument is capable of a parallel detection of multiple characteristic X-ray spectra with a high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). Current spectrometers have a detectable energy range from 50 to 210 eV and from 100 to 2300 eV.\nThe L\u03b1,\u03b2 emission lines of first-transition metal elements are originating from the electronic transitions from the valence bands to the inner L2,3-shell (2p) levels. These transition energies contain information on the energy distribution of 3d and show chemical shift of the 2p inner-shell levels. Thus, the analyses of L-emission spectra of first-transition metal elements have been applied for chemical state analyses and quantitative analyses. For example, the flank method\nis available for the measurement of Fe valence number in the silicate (mainly garnet-type) minerals using EPMA [6\u20138]. This method evaluates the differences between the spectra of divalent and trivalent Fe-bearing minerals by comparing L\u03b2/L\u03b1 intensity ratios, which were measured at fixed L\u03b2 and L\u03b1 wavelength positions.\nOn the other hand, it has been pointed out in previous studies that the spectral shapes and the peak energies of L-emission spectra from the same chemical species containing several transition metal elements can vary depending upon the accelerating voltage of the incident electron beam [7,9,10]. Figure 1a shows Fe L\u03b1,\u03b2 emission spectra of FeO acquired at various accelerating voltages using an SXES instrument attached to an EPMA. The peak positions of L\u03b1 shows shifts depending on the accelerating voltages. This apparent peak shift is due to the self-absorption effect for L\u03b1,\u03b2 emission because L\u03b1,\u03b2 emission energy is almost overlapped with L2,3 absorption edge energy, and an incident electron beam of a higher accelerating voltage causes an X-ray emission source at a deeper region form the specimen surface than that of a lower accelerating voltage [7,9,10]. These self-absorption effects can be visualized as self-absorption spectra by calculating logarithmic intensity ratios of X-ray emission spectra obtained at various accelerating voltages as shown in Fig. 1b [11].\nReceived 16 November 2021; Revised 2 February 2022; Editorial Decision 13 February 2022; Accepted 17 February 2022 \u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

The present systematic study of the use of self-absorption spectra themselves for chemical state analysis represents a new analytical technique. Conventional wavelength dispersive spectroscopy (WDS) requires serial detection of X-rays and scanning by simultaneous mechanical movement of the crystal and detector, which increases the counting time. In contrast to the WDS, the parallel detection system of SXES is an ideal solution for the collection of X-ray spectra, which offers the ability to collect an X-ray spectrum in relatively short acquisition time and offers an easier approach to collecting spectra at varying accelerating voltages to derive a self-absorption\nspectrum. Another significant advantage of the fixed grating spectrometer is that it provides a high reproducibility of measurement of X-ray energy in multiple measurements with varying conditions compared to the traditional WD spectrometry.\nWe investigate the application of obtaining self-absorption spectra from a series of Fe-based materials using an SXES instrument attached to an EPMA. The chemical shifts and changes of intensity profile of derived self-absorption spectra are discussed."

The SXES instrument used in this study was an SXES-ER using a JS2000 grating (dispersive range: 230\u20132300 eV) attached to a field emission EPMA, JEOL JXA-iHP200F. Fe L-emission spectra were acquired at accelerating voltages of 2, 5, 7, 10 and 15 kV to measure differences in the self-absorption spectra under each condition. Probe current was from 10 to 50 nA. Probe diameter was 20\u00b5m. The acquisition time for each spectrum at each accelerating voltage was 5min.\nFe L-emission is composed of four components, L\u03b1, L\u03b2, Ll and L\u03b7. L\u03b1,\u03b2 emission energy of about 710 eV is almost the same energy range with that of L2,3 absorption edge. Thus, L\u03b1 and L\u03b2 emission is affected by L2,3 absorption edge, better known as the self-absorption effect. This effect causes a change in peak shape depending on accelerating voltages. By comparison, Ll,\u03b7 emission energy of about 615 eV is lower than the L2,3 absorption edge and consequently unaffected. Figure 2 shows Fe Ll and L\u03b1 emission spectra of metallic iron obtained at various accelerating voltages. A fitting curve for the spectrum obtained at 15 kV is also shown. Each intensity was normalized by each peak height of intensity. It is seen that theLl peak shape is not changed by accelerating voltages, confirming no absorption effect of L2,3 edge (Fig. 2a). In contrast, L\u03b1 emission peak profile changes depending on the accelerating voltage due to the absorption effect of L2,3 edge (Fig. 2b). The energy calibration of the spectrometer was carried out by\nFig. 2. (a) Fe Ll line and (b) Fe L\u03b1 line spectra of metallic iron obtained at 2, 5, 7, 10 and 15 kV.

The intensity profiles reflect the chemical bonding states of materials examined. The intensity profiles are not necessarily symmetric [10]. These peak positions are also affected by a chemical shift of L2,3 inner-shell levels, which depend on the valence of the Fe atom [13]. An additional effect leading to a change of L\u03b1 and L\u03b2 intensity profile is the self-absorption effect due to a presence of L2,3 absorption edge in the same energy region.\nPrior to calculating the experimental intensity profiles, each spectrum intensity was normalized so that the maximum signal intensity was set to 100, enabling the residual in the fitting evaluations to be comparable across each spectrum. Then, the least square fitting calculations were performed for L\u03b1,\u03b2 intensity profile using multiple Pseudo-Voigt functions (PVFs) [14]. The background intensity was fitted using a linear function. In the fitting calculation, the noise level of the selfabsorption spectra finally obtained changes depending upon the fitting algorithm employed. The relational between the measured intensity and the fitting functions is expressed as\nIO = f1 (E)+ f2 (E)+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 fn (E)+B(E)+ \u03b5,\nwhere fn(E) are PVFs, B(E) is a linear function for the background intensity, and \u03b5 is the residual error between the measured value and the reproduced value by fitting.\nFigure 3a shows L\u03b1 and L\u03b2 peaks of Fe2O3 obtained at an accelerating voltage of 7 kV. Fitted curves by using different numbers of PVFs are also shown, and all fitting curves are plotted by calculating the relative intensity per 0.1 eV from the fitting function. When theL\u03b1 andL\u03b2 region is fitted using two PVFs, the intensity profile cannot be reproduced well seen as a large residual error \u03b5 in Fig. 3b. By adding a further PVF to the L\u03b1 region (three PVFs), the residual error is significantly\nreduced in the region. By adding another PVF to the L\u03b2 region (four PVFs), the residual errors around 720 eV are reduced as seen in Fig. 3b. The fittings using five and six PVFs did not show a further improvement compared with that of four PVFs. Thus, intensity profiles of L\u03b1,\u03b2 peak are fitted by using four PVFs in the following analysis.\nExtraction and comparison of Fe self-absorption spectra SXES instrument used can detect Fe Ll, L\u03b7, L\u03b1 and L\u03b2 spectra at the same time. Since the Fe Ll line is not affected by L2,3 absorption edge, the spectral intensity IL is normalized by the integrated peak intensity of Ll, ILl for comparing the self-absorption effect on L\u03b1,\u03b2 intensity profile due to L2,3 absorption (Fig. 4),\nIN = IL ILl .\nIN is the normalized intensity distribution. Self-absorption spectrum is displayed in the natural logarithm from a normalized intensity distribution INL obtained at a lower accelerating voltage divided by INH obtained at a higher accelerating voltage, ln(INL/INH), should be taken [11]. In practical experiments as shown in Fig. 4, the intensity ratio of INL/INH in L\u03b1,\u03b2 region ranges from 1 to 10. The ln(INL/INH) could be approximated by INL/INH, which is simpler to evaluate. Selfabsorption spectra (A) in this report are evaluated by the following manner,\nA= INL INH .\nSpectral shapes and energy positions of self-absorption peaks Figure 5 shows normalized Fe L\u03b1,\u03b2 emission intensities of (a) FeO (Fe2+) and (b) Fe2O3 (Fe3+) obtained at accelerating voltages of 2, 5, 7, 10 and 15 kV. A clear shift of Fe L\u03b1 peak to the lower-energy side occurs as the accelerating voltage increases for each material. Self-absorption spectra A of the materials are derived from intensity profiles INL of 2 kV divided by INH of 5, 7, 10 and 15 kV. The self-absorption spectra are shown\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /jm icro/article/71/3/169/6532032 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nFig. 4. Fe L spectra of L\u03b1, L\u03b2, Ll and L\u03b7 normalized by integrated intensities of Fe Ll line.\nFig. 5. Fe L-emission and obtained self-absorption spectra of (a) FeO (Fe2+) and (b) Fe2O3 (Fe3+). Although the emission peak position depends on the accelerating voltage due to self-absorption effect, absorption peak derived is not.\nby dotted lines below the Fe L\u03b1,\u03b2 emission intensity profiles of each material. It can be seen that the absorption peak position at about 710 eV is unchanged by the accelerating voltage. The fact that the absorption peak position is fixed enables this approach to be made. The self-absorption spectrum is referred to as the soft X-ray self-absorption structure (SX-SAS).\nThe absorption peaks at 708.5 eV for FeO and 710.1 eV for Fe2O3 should correspond to L3 absorption peaks of the materials. A structure in 720\u2013725 eV of each material should correspond to L2 absorption peak structure. The higher L3 absorption peak energy of Fe2O3 by 1.6 eV than that of FeO appears to be due to a chemical shift of Fe L3-level resulting from the higher valence of Fe3+ in Fe2O3 compared to Fe2+ in FeO. A chemical shift of a core-level electron should result in a shift in both the self-absorption and the emission intensity. However, the L\u03b1 shift with accelerating voltage of FeO is\nlarger than that of Fe2O3 as indicated in Fig. 5 by lateral arrows. Thus, the difference is originated from a different intensity distribution of L\u03b1 emission and L3 absorption peaks and the energy separation, which are shown for different materials; see Fig. 5.\nFigure 6 shows self-absorption spectra obtained for Fe metal, FeO, Fe3O4, Fe2O3, FeS and FeS2. The peak structures at about 710 and 720 eV correspond to L3 and L2 absorption edges, respectively. The L3 peaks of Fe oxides are systematically shifted to the high-energy side with an increase in the oxidation state of Fe from Fe2+ of FeO to Fe3+ of Fe2O3, and the L3 peaks of sulfides of FeS (Fe2+) and FeS2 (Fe4+) also show a similar shift to the high-energy side with a higher oxidation state. The systematic shifts of the L3 absorption peak with the change in oxidation state have been reported by electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) studies [15,16],\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /jm icro/article/71/3/169/6532032 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nand the SX-SAS results are consistent with these previous studies. The self-absorption spectra of metallic Fe and FeS2 show additional shoulder structures at around 715 eV, which are consistent with EELS [17] and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) experiments [18]. Although chemical shifts in different oxidation states of Fe were successfully observed by present SX-SAS method, more fine separated structures of energy states than Fig. 6 have been reported by EELS and XAFS experiments [16,19]. As the energy resolution of this method depends on the resolution of SXES, a further development of SXES spectrometer is necessary. Another factor that affects the energy resolution of this method, which is not taken into account in the present evaluation, is the spatial distribution of X-ray emission sources produced by the incident electron probe."

            "text": "A systematic method to derive a FeL self-absorption spectrum from experimental L-emission spectra, named SX-SAS, is presented. This method could also be done by using a conventional EPMA of serial detection in principle, except problems of reproducibility and an S/N of data. The parallel detection of a recent SXES instrument without a moving mechanism realizes a good signal-to-noise ratio in a shorter acquisition time. Fitting calculation using four PVFs was able to reproduce the L\u03b1,\u03b2 emission spectra with a small enough residual error for Fe-based materials. The self-absorption spectra of SX-SAS were evaluated by a simple division of INL/INH. The present energy resolution of SX-SAS is not enough compared with those of EELS and XANES, but chemical shifts in different charged states of Fe were successfully observed. Further application of this method by using a recent SXES system for 3d-transition metal elements is interesting, especially in Li-ion battery materials [20]."
