    "abstractText": "Hilbert space fragmentation is a novel type of ergodicity breaking in closed quantum systems. Recently, an algebraic approach was utilized to provide a definition of Hilbert space fragmentation characterizing families of Hamiltonian systems based on their (generalized) symmetries. In this paper, we reveal a simple connection between the aforementioned classification of physical systems and their coherence generation properties, quantified by the coherence generating power (CGP). The maximum CGP (in the basis associated to the algebra of each family of Hamiltonians) is exactly related to the number of independent Krylov subspaces K, which is precisely the characteristic used in the classification of the system. In order to gain further insight, we numerically simulate paradigmatic models with both ordinary symmetries and Hilbert space fragmentation, comparing the behavior of the CGP in each case with the system dimension. More generally, allowing the time evolution to be any unitary channel in a specified algebra, we show analytically that the scaling of the Haar averaged value of the CGP depends only on K. These results illustrate the intuitive relationship between coherence generation and symmetry algebras.",

Recently, an algebraic approach was utilized to provide a definition of Hilbert space fragmentation characterizing families of Hamiltonian systems based on their (generalized) symmetries. In this paper, we reveal a simple connection between the aforementioned classification of physical systems and their coherence generation properties, quantified by the coherence generating power (CGP). The maximum CGP (in the basis associated to the algebra of each family of Hamiltonians) is exactly related to the number of independent Krylov subspaces K, which is precisely the characteristic used in the classification of the system. In order to gain further insight, we numerically simulate paradigmatic models with both ordinary symmetries and Hilbert space fragmentation, comparing the behavior of the CGP in each case with the system dimension. More generally, allowing the time evolution to be any unitary channel in a specified algebra, we show analytically that the scaling of the Haar averaged value of the CGP depends only on K. These results illustrate the intuitive relationship between coherence generation and symmetry algebras.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nNon-equilibrium quantum dynamics of closed systems has been an extensively studied issue in recent years. Generic isolated quantum systems are expected to thermalize in the thermodynamic limit, in the sense that for any small subsystem the rest of the system acts as a bath, so that the expectation value of local observables coincides with that derived by statistical mechanical ensembles [1, 2]. A central role in the understanding of this phenomenon is played by the so-called eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) [3\u20135], according to which, under certain conditions, the energy eigenstates are conjectured to be thermal, i.e. the expectation values of observables with local support over the energy eigenstates coincide with those of a thermal ensemble with temperature related to the energy [6].\nWhile ETH is expected to hold for generic systems [5, 7\u2013 15], several ETH-violating classes of models are known. Integrable systems and many-body localized (MBL) systems are the two prime examples, where an extensive number of conserved quantities prevent the system from thermalizing. The conserved quantities are a result of symmetries readily encoded in the Hamiltonian (in the integrable systems) or from emergent symmetries created by strong disorder (in the MBL case). More novel types of disorder-free ergodicity breaking models were recently observed and studied, dubbed quantum many-body scars (QMBS) [16\u201340] and Hilbert space fragmentation [29, 41\u201353]. QMBS correspond to a weak violation of ETH, in which only a small set of eigenstates in the bulk of the spectrum are non-thermal. Emergence of scar dynamics has been linked with the existence of dynamical symmetries [38, 54\u201356], that allow the formation of towers of scar eigenstates inside an invariant subspace. Hilbert space fragmentation\n\u2217 e-mail: fandread@usc.edu \u2020 e-mail: zanardi@usc.edu\ncorresponds to the broader phenomenon of \"shattering\" of the Hilbert space in exponentially many dynamically disconnected subspaces (referred to as Krylov subspaces) with no obvious associated conserved quantities. In addition to weak violation, such systems can exhibit a strong violation of ETH, where a nonzero measure subset of all the eigenstates is non-thermal.\nRecently, an algebraic framework was utilized to analyze the phenomenon of Hilbert space fragmentation for families of Hamiltonians [53], establishing the role of non-conventional symmetries. Such an approach reveals the central role of the symmetry algebra in the classification of the system, and is applicable to conventional models as well [57]. Another inherent advantage is that the properties exhibited by the families of Hamiltonians are free from fine-tuning. In general, systems exhibiting novel ergodic behavior (such as QMBS and Hilbert space fragmentation) belong to special classes of Hamiltonians [53] that are of great interest in attempts to fully describe the behavior of non-equilibrium closed quantum systems [20, 22, 42, 58\u201360].\nThe ergodic properties of a system are correlated with information-theoretic signatures, such as eigenstate entanglement [61\u201363] and information scrambling [18, 64, 65]. In this paper, we establish a connection between the classification framework introduced in [53] and coherence, quantified by the coherence generating power (CGP) [66\u201369]. The CGP bound established in this paper becomes particularly relevant for the aforementioned special classes of Hamiltonians exhibiting Hilbert space fragmentation.\nThis paper is structured as follows. In Section II, we present an analytical upper bound of the CGP of families of Hamiltonian evolutions, with respect to a basis induced by the algebra of each family; this bound is fully described by the aforementioned classification of the families of Hamiltonians. We, also, provide numerical results of systems with both ordinary symmetries and Hilbert space fragmentation and compare the behavior of the CGP as we increase the system size. In\nar X\niv :2\n21 2.\n14 40\n8v 2\n[ qu\nan t-\nph ]\n8 J\nun 2\n02 3\n2 Section III, we allow the evolution to be any unitary channel in a prescribed algebra and show that the Haar average value of the CGP is typical and its scaling with the system size is fully described by the classification of unitary evolutions in the algebra. In Section IV, we\nconclude with a brief discussion of the results. The detailed proofs of the analytical results are included in the Supplemental Material A."

Letting Z(A) := A \u2229 A\u2032 denote the center of A with dZ := dimZ(A), a fundamental structure theorem for C\u2217-algebras implies a decomposition of the Hilbert space of the form [70]\nH \u223c= \u2295dZJ=1 C nJ \u2297 CdJ , A \u223c= \u2295dZJ=1 1nJ \u2297 L(C dJ ), A\u2032 \u223c= \u2295dZJ=1 L(C nJ )\u2297 1dJ .\n(1)\nDue to the above decomposition,\ndimH \u2261 d = dZ\u2211 J=1 nJdJ ,\ndimA = dZ\u2211 J=1 d2J =: d(A),\ndimA\u2032 = dZ\u2211 J=1 n2J =: d(A\u2032).\nIn general the algebra A\u2032 is non-Abelian and we will denote as M \u2282 A\u2032 the (possibly not unique) maximal Abelian subalgebra of the commutant with dimension K := dimM = \u2211dZ J=1 nJ . Note that K is exactly the number of linearly independent common invariant subspaces of all operators in A. Given a basis B = {|i\u27e9}di=1 of H, one can always express a pure state as a linear superposition of the states |i\u27e9. This fact is experimentally materialized as what is called quantum coherence [71]. In general, one defines B-incoherent states \u03c1 (\u03c1 \u2265 0,Tr \u03c1 = 1) as states diagonal in B (coherent states are all states that are not incoherent). Given a unitary operator U \u2208 L(H) a measure of its coherence generating power (CGP) with respect to the basis B is given by [67]\nCB(U) = 1\u2212 1\nd d\u2211 i,j=1 | \u27e8i|U |j\u27e9|4 (2)\nlogK Class representative \u223c O(1) Discrete global symmetry \u223c logL Continuous global symmetry \u223c L Fragmentation\nTable I: Classification of families Hamiltonians of the form Eq.

[53] introduced an algebra based classification of multi-site Hamiltonian models. Given an algebra A that can be generated by local operators hj , one considers the family of Hamiltonians\nH = \u2211 j Jj hj (3)\nwhere Jj are arbitrary coupling constants. Then, the symmetries of the system are characterized by the scaling of K with the system size. For example, for 1D systems of size L, if logK \u223c L, then the family of Hamiltonians in Eq. (3) possesses an exponentially large number of dynamically disconnected subspaces, which serves as the definition of Hilbert space fragmentation (see Table I). The models exhibiting Hilbert space fragmentation were shown to exhibit nonlocal conserved quantities, dubbed as statistically localized integrals of motion (SLIOMs) [44, 53].\nB. Coherence generating power bound\nWe consider an algebra A = \u27e8hj\u27e9 and families of Hamiltonians of the form Eq. (3). Clearly, H \u2208 A and due to Eq. (1)\nU := exp(\u2212itH) = \u2295dZJ=11nJ \u2297 UJ (4)\nWe also consider a basis BA = {|\u03d5J\u27e9 \u2297 |\u03c8J\u27e9 | J = 1, . . . , dZ , \u03d5J = 1, . . . , nJ , \u03c8J = 1, . . . , dJ}, where |\u03d5J\u27e9 and |\u03c8J\u27e9 span CnJ and CdJ of the decomposition Eq. (1). We can, then, show that\nProposition 1. i) The CGP of U = exp(\u2212itH) \u2208 A in a basis BA induced by the algebra decomposition is\nCBA(U) = 1\u2212 1\nd \u2211 J,\u03c8J ,\u03c8\u2032J nJ | \u27e8\u03c8J |UJ |\u03c8\u2032J\u27e9|4\n=: 1\u2212 1 d fBA(U)\n(5)\nii) The maximum value of the CGP is\nmax U\u2208A\nCBA(U) = 1\u2212 1\nd K (6)\nand is achieved when | \u27e8\u03c8J |UJ |\u03c8\u2032J\u27e9| = d \u22121/2 J for all J .\n3 We note that if U is any unitary operator in L(H), then the maximum CGP is Cmax = 1\u2212 1d [67, 72, 73]. The difference in the bound of Eq. (6) is an extra factor of K, which is exactly the number of independent common invariant subspaces for all evolutions generated by the family of Hamiltonians in Eq. (3). The scaling of K with the system dimension provides a classification of this family (see e.g. Table I), thus from Eq. (6) the scaling of the maximum CGP of the entire family of Hamiltonians is also dependent solely on this classification as well. This observation constitutes an exact, analytical implementation of the intuitive connection between (generalized) system symmetries and coherence generation. Note that the Hilbert space decomposition Eq. (1) is a basic element for the protection of quantum coherence in information processes, e.g. by decoherence-free subspaces and subsystems [74\u201377]. There, the algebra A is generated by the system operators of the interaction Hamiltonian and K is simply the total dimension of decoherence-free subsystems CnJ ."

As so, if we choose randomly a Hamiltonian from Eq. (3), the resulting evolution need not be typical. In order to evaluate the behavior of the CGP in such a case, we numerically simulate the evolution of spin-chain models in 1D with L sites: (i) the spin-1/2 XXZ model with on-site magnetic field, (ii) the spin-1 Temperley-Lieb (TL) model, and (iii) the fermionic t\u2212 Jz model.\nHXXZ = \u2211 j ( J\u22a5j ( \u03c3xj \u03c3 x j+1 + \u03c3 y j \u03c3 y j+1 ) +\n+Jzj \u03c3 z j\u03c3 z j+1 + hj\u03c3 z j ) HTL =\n\u2211 j Jjej,j+1, where ej,k = 3(|\u03c8sing\u27e9 \u27e8\u03c8sing|)j,k\nand |\u03c8sing\u27e9j,k = 1\u221a 3 \u2211 \u03b1\u2208{0,1,2} |\u03b1\u03b1\u27e9j,k\nHt\u2212Jz = \u2211 j \u2212tj,j+1 \u2211 \u03c3\u2208{\u2191,\u2193} ( c\u0303j,\u03c3 c\u0303 \u2020 j+1,\u03c3 + h.c. ) +\n+Jzj,j+1S z j S z j+1 + hjS z j + gj ( Szj )2) ,\nwhere Szj := c\u0303 \u2020 j,\u2191c\u0303j,\u2191 \u2212 c\u0303 \u2020 j,\u2193c\u0303j,\u2193 and c\u0303j,\u03c3 := cj,\u03c3 ( 1\u2212 c\u2020j,\u2212\u03c3cj,\u2212\u03c3 ) (7)\nHere, \u03c3\u03b1j , \u03b1 \u2208 x, y, z denote the Pauli matrices. The XXZ model has shown to be integrable by Bethe ansatz [78] and possesses a conventional U(1) symmetry with the associated conserved quantity \u03c3ztot = \u2211 j \u03c3 z j . The sectors of Eq. (1) are labeled by this conserved quantity (J = L/2\u2212 \u03c3ztot = 0, . . . , L) and the dimensions of the irreducible representations of A and A\u2032 are dJ = ( L J\n) and nJ = 1 respectively [53]. For a given J there is one common Krylov subspace (since nJ = 1) and is spanned\nby the z \u2212 basis product states with \u03c3ztot = L/2\u2212 J). Note that KXXZ = L+ 1, which scales linearly with the system size.\nThe TL model is an example of Hilbert space fragmentation. The dynamically disconnected Krylov subspaces are understood by the use of a basis of dots and noncrossing dimers [53, 79, 80]. Each basis state consists of a pattern of dimers that connect two sites and represent the state |\u03c8sing\u27e9j,k. The rest of the sites (that are not connected to either end of a dimer) make up the dots and the state |\u03c8dots\u27e9 is chosen such that it is annihilated by all projectors |\u03c8dim\u27e9m,m+1 \u27e8\u03c8dim|m,m+1 (where m labels all dots while excluding the dimers). The algebra formed by the L \u2212 1 generators ej,j+1 is the Temperley-Lieb algebra TLL(q), where q+ q\u22121 = 3 (which is the number of local degrees of freedom in a spin-1 model)[53]. It has been shown that, for even L, the sectors of the decomposition Eq. (1) are labeled by J = 0, . . . , L/2 with corresponding dimensions\nnJ = [2J + 1]q, dJ =\n( L\nL/2 + J\n) \u2212 ( L\nL/2 + J + 1 ) where [n]q := (qn \u2212 q\u2212n)/(q \u2212 q\u22121) is a q-deformed integer [79]. It is, then, straightforward to show that K = q\u2212L(qL+2\u22121) 2\n(q2\u22121)2 , which scales exponentially with the system-size.\nThe t\u2212 Jz also falls into the category of Hilbert space fragmentation. The Hamiltonian acts effectively in the Hilbert space with no double occupancy and it has been shown that all operators in the commutant algebra are diagonal in the product state basis[53]. The sectors are characterized by the pattern of spins \u2191 and \u2193, which remains invariant under the action of the Hamiltonian[44]. For open boundary conditions (OBC) there are 2L+1 \u2212 1 such sectors (all with nJ = 1), so K = 2L+1 \u2212 1 which scales exponentially with L[53]. We simulate exact dynamics for the above systems and for different system-sizes with the coupling constants randomly drawn from [0, 1] (each time we increase the system-size we add one more set of randomly chosen couplings to the previously drawn ones). The choice of the coupling constants sets the energy scale of the Hamiltonians, and in turn the timescale of the dynamics. For each model we construct the relevant bases described above and compute the long-time average of the CGP of the unitary evolution. In Fig. 1a, 1b we observe that for the fragmented models the long-time average of the quantity fBA(U) (related to the CGP via Eq. (5)) has a similar behavior with the number of Krylov subspaces K. Specifically, we find that (see also Appendix A 4)\nfBt\u2212Jz (Ut) t \u223c d0.83(compared to Kt\u2212Jz \u223c dlog3 2) fBTL(Ut) t \u223c d0.95 (compared to KTL \u223c dlog3 q,\nq = (3 + \u221a 5)/2 \u2243 2.62)\nFragmented systems can be further characterized into strongly or weakly fragmented depending on the size maxJ dJ of the biggest Krylov subspace; specifically for strongly (weakly) fragmented systems, maxJ dJ/d\u2192 0\n(maxJ dJ/d\u2192 1) as d\u2192 \u221e [42, 53]. When the size of the fragments is large enough (in the thermodynamic limit) and the Hamiltonian is non-integrable in these fragments, signatures of thermalization within the fragment can be observed, a phenomenon referred to as Krylov-restricted thermalization [47]. In fact, the TL model has been shown to exhibit thermalization in some\nof its exponentially large Krylov subspaces [47], which implies that the behavior of the CGP is expected to be closer to that of a generic model (see also Section III). In contrast to the fragmented models, the behavior of the CGP of the integrable XXZ model with the system dimension is far away from the bound Eq. (6) (Fig. 1c). This aligns with the expectation that integrable models do not showcase features of generic evolutions, even after resolving for the symmetries. Fig. 2 emphasizes the vastly different CGP behaviors of the different classes of models simulated; for finite dimensions the bound Eq. (6) forces the CGP of the fragmented models to remain much lower than that of the integrable model. This shows that despite the fact that fragmented models are in general non-integrable, emergent generalized symmetries from kinetic constraints lead to a milder mixing of different parts of the Hilbert space, with possible physical importance for information processing tasks, e.g. protection of information via decoherence free subspaces [76, 81, 82] or utilization of (dynamical) localization for quantum memory implementations [46, 83].\n5"

            "heading": "IV. CONCLUSION",
            "text": "In this paper we revealed a connection between a classification of families of Hamiltonian evolutions and their coherence generating power (CGP) with respect to a basis induced by the family. Specifically, the families of Hamiltonians were previously classified based on the scaling of the number K of independent dynamically disconnected subspaces (called Krylov subspaces) with the system size[53]. Each family of Hamiltonians is defined with respect to an algebra A generated by local terms that are used to compose the Hamiltonians. The generalized symmetries of the system are captured by the commutant algebra A\u2032 and K coincides with the dimension of the maximally Abelian subalgebra of A\u2032. The Krylov subspaces are described\nby an algebra-induced Hilbert space decomposition, which also specifies a relevant basis. Our main result was then the demonstration that the maximum CGP (with respect to this relevant basis) of such a family of Hamiltonians is exactly related to K, hence its scaling with the system dimension is precisely dependent on the classification of the system. This gives an exact quantitative implementation of the intuitive connection between (generalized) symmetries and coherence generation. A principal example is the situation of Hilbert space fragmentation, in which case K scales exponentially with the system size, leading to a substantially lower upper bound for the CGP in finite dimensions.\nIn order to further investigate the above observations, we numerically simulated different families of 1D spinchain models and computed long time averages of their CGP with respect to the basis induced by the algebra of each family. We observed that for the fragmented systems, fermionic t\u2212 Jz and spin-1 Temperley-Lieb (TL) models, the CGP follows closely the exponential behavior of the bound induced by the exponential number of Krylov subspaces. The particularly significant agreement in the TL case was connected with the previously observed Krylov restricted thermalization in some of its large Krylov subspaces in the thermodynamic limit. In contrast, in the case of the integrable spin-1/2 XXZ model the CGP greatly deviates from the bound set by the linear number of Krylov subspaces. Naturally, the above picture ties into the fact that the maximum (or close to the maximum) CGP is expected from systems that exhibit generic features inside sufficiently large Krylov subspaces.\nThe above observation is made precise by allowing the unitary evolution to be generated by any unitary in A and performing the Haar average of the CGP over all unitaries in A. We show that the scaling of this average value with the system size depends exactly on the classification of the model in terms of the system size scaling of K. In addition, Levy\u2019s lemma ensures that the Haar average will be typical for sufficiently large Krylov subspaces.\nA natural question one may ask is if there are more information-theoretic quantities that can be linked (in an exact fashion) with the classification of models induced by their symmetry algebra. Moreover, it would be interesting to further investigate the conditions under which families of models exhibit CGP close to the bound, as well as derive explicit connections with their ergodic and integrability properties inside the various Krylov subspaces.\nV.

Proof of Proposition 2\nDue to Eq. (4), taking the Haar average over all U \u2208 A corresponds to taking the Haar average over the unitaries in the subsystems CdJ . Defining \u03a0\u03c8J = |\u03c8J\u27e9 \u27e8\u03c8J | we can rewrite Eq. (5) as\nCBA(U) = 1\u2212 1\nd \u2211 J,\u03c8J ,\u03c8\u2032J nJ ( Tr [ \u03a0\u03c8JUJ\u03a0\u03c8\u2032JU \u2020 J ])2 = 1\u2212 1 d \u2211 J,\u03c8J ,\u03c8\u2032J nJ Tr [ (\u03a0\u03c8JUJ\u03a0\u03c8\u2032JU \u2020 J \u2297\u03a0\u03c8JUJ\u03a0\u03c8\u2032JU \u2020 J) ]\n= 1\u2212 1 d \u2211 J,\u03c8J ,\u03c8\u2032J nJ Tr [ \u03a0\u22972\u03c8JU \u22972 J \u03a0 \u22972 \u03c8\u2032J U\u2020J \u22972] (A5)\nBy Schur-Weyl duality the commutant of the algebra MJ generated by {M\u22972J |MJ \u2208 L(CdJ )} is M\u2032J = CS2, where S2 = {1, S} is the symmetric group over the copies in CdJ \u2297 CdJ [84]. Since we can always find a unitary basis of L(CdJ ), it follows that MJ is equivalently generated by {U\u22972J |UJ \u2208 L(CdJ ), UJ U \u2020 J = 1dJ}. Also, note\nthat PM\u2032J [\u2022] := U \u22972 J [\u2022]U \u2020 J \u22972 UJ is an orthogonal projector on M\u2032J [85]. So, we can express PM\u2032J in terms of the orthonormal basis {\n1+S\u221a 2dJ (dJ+1) , 1\u2212S\u221a 2dJ (dJ\u22121)\n} of CS2:\nPM\u2032J [\u2022] = U \u22972 J [\u2022]U \u2020 J\n\u22972 UJ = \u2211 \u03b7=\u00b11 1+ \u03b7 S 2dJ(dJ + \u03b7) \u27e81+ \u03b7 S, \u2022\u27e9 (A6)\n9 Taking the Haar average over the unitaries in CdJ in Eq. (A5) and using Eq. (A6) we get\nCBA(U) U\u2208A = 1\u2212 1 d \u2211 J,\u03c8J ,\u03c8\u2032J nJ Tr [ \u03a0\u22972\u03c8J \u2211 \u03b7=\u00b11 1+ \u03b7 S 2dJ(dJ + \u03b7) \u27e81+ \u03b7 S,\u03a0\u03c8\u2032J \u27e9 ] = 1\u2212 1 d \u2211 J,\u03c8J ,\u03c8\u2032J nJ Tr [ \u03a0\u22972\u03c8J 1+ S dJ(dJ + 1) ]\n= 1\u2212 1 d \u2211 J,\u03c8J ,\u03c8\u2032J nJ 2 dJ(dJ + 1) = 1\u2212 1 d \u2211 J 2dJ dJ + 1 nJ\n(A7)\n3. Typicality inside sufficiently large Krylov subspaces\nThis follows from Proposition 4 of [67]. The key ingredient is Levy\u2019s lemma for Haar distributed unitaries in CdJ . The operator norms used are the Schatten k-norms[86] defined as \u2225X\u2225k := (\u2211 i s k i )1/k, where {si}i are the singular values of X. For k \u2192 \u221e, \u2225X\u2225\u221e = maxi{si} is the usual operator norm. Lemma 1 (Levy\u2019s lemma). If X : U(dJ) 7\u2192 R is a Lipschitz continuous function of constant \u03bb, i.e. |X(UJ)\u2212 X(VJ)| \u2264 \u03bb\u2225X(UJ)\u2212X(VJ)\u22252, then\nPr (\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223X(UJ)\u2212X(UJ)UJ\u2208CdJ \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2265 \u03f5) \u2264 e\u2212 dJ \u03f524\u03bb2 (A8) We shall also need known norm inequalities such as\n|Tr[AB]| \u2264 \u2225A\u22251\u2225B\u2225\u221e (A9) If T is a positive, trace-preserving map, \u2225T (X)\u22251 \u2264 \u2225X\u22251 (A10) 1 2 \u2225|\u03c8\u27e9 \u27e8\u03c8| \u2212 |\u03d5\u27e9 \u27e8\u03d5|\u22251 \u2264 \u2225|\u03c8\u27e9 \u2212 |\u03d5\u27e9\u2225 \u2264 2 (A11)\nChoose U = \u2295J1nJ \u2297 UJ , V = \u2295J1nJ \u2297 VJ \u2208 A. Note that using the swap trick Tr[AB] = Tr[SA\u2297B], we can rewrite\nCBA(U) = 1\u2212 1\nd \u2211 J nJ \u2211 \u03c8J ,\u03c8\u2032J | \u27e8\u03c8J |UJ |\u03c8\u2032J\u27e9|4 = 1\u2212 1 d \u2211 J nJ \u2211 \u03c8\u2032J Tr [ SJ ( DJUJ(\u03a0\u03c8\u2032J ) )\u22972] (A12) where DJ(\u2022) = \u2211 \u03c8J \u03a0\u03c8J \u2022 \u03a0\u03c8J , UJ(\u2022) = UJ \u2022 U \u2020 J and SJ is the swap in CdJ \u2297 CdJ .

System dimension scalings\nThe scaling of fBt\u2212Jz (Ut) t and fBTL(Ut) t in Section II C is found by finding the best exponential-law (f(x) = A xB) fit of the numerical data. Specifically, we find fBt\u2212Jz (Ut) t \u223c d\u03bb with \u03bb = 0.8340\u00b1 0.0023 and RMSE = 2.989 and fBTL(Ut) t \u223c d\u03bb with \u03bb = 0.9468\u00b1 0.0016 and RMSE = 2.192.\nThe scalings of Kt\u2212Jz and KTL follow directly from the expressions Kt\u2212Jz = 2L+1 \u2212 1 and KTL = q\u2212L(qL+2\u22121) 2\n(q2\u22121)2 , where in both cases L = log3 d. Explicitly:\nKt\u2212Jz = 2 L+1 \u2212 1 = 2log3 d+1 \u2212 1 \u223c 2log3 d = dlog3 2\nKTL = q\u2212L\n( qL+2 \u2212 1 )2 (q2 \u2212 1)2 \u223c qL = qlog3 d = dlog3 q"
