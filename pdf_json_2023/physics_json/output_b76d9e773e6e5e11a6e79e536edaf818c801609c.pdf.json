    "abstractText": "Curcumin possesses a wide spectrum of liver cancer inhibition effects, yet it has chemical instability and poor metabolic properties as a drug candidate. To alleviate these problems, a series of new mono-carbonyl curcumin derivatives G1\u2013G7 were designed, synthesized, and evaluated by in vitro and in vivo studies. Compound G2 was found to be the most potent derivative (IC50 = 15.39 \u03bcM) compared to curcumin (IC50 = 40.56 \u03bcM) by anti-proliferation assay. Subsequently, molecular docking, wound healing, transwell, JC-1 staining, and Western blotting experiments were performed, and it was found that compound G2 could suppress cell migration and induce cell apoptosis by inhibiting the phosphorylation of AKT and affecting the expression of apoptosisrelated proteins. Moreover, the HepG2 cell xenograft model and H&E staining results confirmed that compound G2 was more effective than curcumin in inhibiting tumor growth. Hence, G2 is a promising leading compound with the potential to be developed as a chemotherapy agent for hepatocellular carcinoma.",

            "text": "Curcumin (Curc), a well-known active polyphenolic component from the rhizome of the plant Curcuma longa, demonstrates a variety of pharmacological properties, particularly anticancer activity, which has attracted widespread interest among medicinal chemists in recent years [1\u20133]. Curcumin is being developed as a potential anti-hepatoma drug, although there have been absorption issues. One of the primary causes of chemical instability and poor metabolic characteristics, which lead to low bioavailability and limited therapeutic value, is the instability of the \u03b2-diketone group in the curcumin structure [4,5]. The curcumin \u03b2-diketone structure has undergone some changes, including the retention of the aryl rings\u2019 3-, 5-, and 7-carbon spacers [6\u201317]. The structure\u2013activity relationship (SAR) study of curcumin derivatives could be concluded as shown in Figure 1: (1) shortening the linker from seven carbon atoms (C7) to five carbon atoms (C5) or three carbon atoms (C3) can improve the stability and anticancer activity, as demonstrated by compound 4 [6,18,19]; (2) introducing a five- or six-carbon ring or a heterocyclic ring (N, O, and S atoms) into the \u03b2-diketone moiety can increase molecular rigidity and improve anticancer activity, as is the case for compound EF24, which is now in clinical trials [20]; (3) metallo-curcumin-conjugated DNA complexes by using Cu2+/Ni2+/Zn2+ metal ions can improve curcumin solubility and enhance DNA-binding ability, an example being Cu2+-conjugated DNA complexes [21]; (4) introducing a methyl group at the C-2 and C-6 positions exhibits a steric hindrance effect toward metabolizing\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6796. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28196796 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6796 2 of 15\nenzymes, such as alcohol dehydrogenase, and demonstrates significantly higher activity than curcumin, as shown by compound 1 [22]; (5) the hydrogenation function of the \u03b2-diketone moiety is also important, like in dihydrocurcumin and tetrahydrocurcumin derivatives [23,24]; (6) the presence of a coplanar hydrogen donor group at the C-4 position can improve anticancer activity, exemplified by compound 10 as a potential antiandrogenic agent for the treatment of prostate cancer [25]; (7) masking the 4-OH groups of the benzyl rings enhances curcumin\u2019s water solubility and kinetic stability, as demonstrated by compound 11b [26,27]; (8) introducing suitable substituents such as a methoxy group on the aromatic ring can also improve the antitumor activity, shown by, for example, the inhibitory activity of compound F10 against human prostate cancer cell line PC-3, which is 73 times that of curcumin [28].\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 17\nDNA-binding ability, an example being Cu2+-conjugated DNA complexes [21]; (4) introducing a methyl group at the C-2 and C-6 positions exhibits a steric hindrance effect toward metabolizing enzymes, such as alcohol dehydrogenase, and demonstrates significantly higher activity than curcumin, as shown by compound 1 [22]; (5) the hydrogenation function of the \u03b2-diketone moiety is also important, like in dihydrocurcumin and tetrahy-\nrocurcumin derivatives [23,24]; (6) the presence of a coplanar hydrogen donor gr up at the C-4 p sition improve anticancer activity, exemplified by compound 10 s a potential antiandrog nic agent for the tre tment of prost te cancer [25]; (7) masking the 4-OH groups of the benzyl ring enhances curcumin\u2019s wa er olubility and kinetic stability, as demonstrated by compoun 11b [26,27]; (8) introducing suit ble substituents such as a methoxy group on the aromatic ring can also improve the antitumor activity, shown by, for example, the inhibitory activity of comp und F10 against human prostate cancer cell line PC-3, which is 73 times that of curcumin [28].\nFigure 1. The SAR analysis and the structures of the most important compounds.\nAccording to the SAR study, converting the -diketone structure into a single ketone can greatly increase stability and pharmacological activity [7,9,13\u201315]. Additionally, curcumin\u2019s hydroxy on benzene can be changed to improve anticancer biological activity using compounds like mono-carbonyl curcumin cinnamyl ester B5 and dimethyl curcumin (ASC-J9) [29\u201331]. Therefore, the major emphasis of curcumin structural alteration is on the benzene hydroxyl group and the \u03b2-diketone structure, which might significantly improve stability, bioavailability, and anticancer activity [32\u201334]. However, the structural diversity is relatively constrained and the underlying mechanism involved in the effect of curcumin is not well elucidated, especially in antitumor activity. In this study, we introduce natural products such as benzoic acid analogs or niacin on the hydroxy of mono-carbonyl curcumin to increase the anti-human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) activity."

Biological Assays 2.2.1. Cell Culture\nHuman hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 was obtained from Nanjing Forestry University. MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) was purchased from Sigma, and 6-well, 24-well, and 96-well plates were purchased from Beyotime Biotechnology. Cells were grown in DMEM medium with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 \u25e6C and 5% CO2. All compounds were dissolved in DMSO of pure analytical grade, diluted using DMEM medium, and the final concentration had no effects on cell viability.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6796 4 of 15\n2.2.2. MTT Assay\nHepG2 cells (5000 cells/well) in the logarithmic phase were treated with 5, 10, and 15 \u00b5M curcumin derivatives G1\u2013G7 in 96-well culture plates for 48 h. Then, 20 \u00b5L, 4 mg/mL MTT of PBS solution was added to each well. After incubation for 4 h, the medium was carefully removed and formazan crystals were dissolved in 200 \u00b5L of DMSO in the dark, and then absorbance values at 490 nm wavelength were read on a Super Microplate Reader (MQX2OO) (BioTek, the United States). Compound G2 was then selected to treat HepG2 cells with different concentrations (0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 \u00b5M) for 48 h, and IC50 values were calculated using GraphPad Prism 8 software. Each assay was performed with at least three independent experiments [37].\n2.2.3. Clone Formation Assay HepG2 cell line (500 cells per well) was incubated in a 6-well plate at 37 \u25e6C and 5% CO2 for 12 h. Compound G2 was added containing the indicated concentrations (0, 1, 2, 4 \u00b5M) in DMEM medium and then incubated for 2 weeks. Subsequently, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.1% crystal violet solution for about 20 min. The cells were washed with PBS, dried, and photographed, and the clone formation rate was calculated [38].\n2.2.4. Wound Healing Assay\nHepG2 cells (1.5 \u00d7 105 cells/well) were put into 24-well plates and cultured in DMEM to a nearly confluent cell monolayer. Then, the scratch was performed using a 10 \u00b5L plastic pipette tip. The debris or detached cells were washed twice with serum-free DMEM medium. The cells were subjected to target compound G2 at different concentrations (0, 2.5, 5, 10 \u00b5M) in fresh DMEM medium and subsequently cultured for 24 h or 48 h. The migration rate was measured and photographed under a DMIL LED 3000 inverted microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) [39].\n2.2.5. Transwell Migration Assay\nHepG2 cells (5 \u00d7 104 cells/well) were incubated in 200 \u00b5L serum-free DMEM in the upper transwell chamber and 700 \u00b5L DMEM at the bottom. The cells were treated with G2 (0, 5 \u00b5M) for 48 h. The filter was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 15 min. The migrated cells on the lower surface were counted three times under an inverted microscope [40].\n2.2.6. Mitochondrial Membrane Potential Assay\nHepG2 cells were treated with compound G2 (0, 2.5, 5, 10 \u00b5M) in a 6-well plate for 48 h. The cells were washed with PBS and 1 mL JC-1 staining (Beyotime, C2006) was added for 20 min at 37 \u25e6C. After being rinsed twice with PBS, the samples were examined by a Nikon fluorescence microscope (TE2000-U, Nikon Inc., Tokyo, Japan) at 40\u00d7 g magnification under 488 nm and 550 nm [31].\n2.2.7. Western Blot Analysis\nHepG2 cells in 6-well plates were rinsed twice with cold PBS and lysed on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation, the protein concentrations were measured using the BCATM protein quantification kit (Beyotime Biotechnology). Antibodies against AKT (C67E7), Bcl-2 (D55G8), phospho-Bcl-2 (5H2), caspase 3 (D3R6Y), cleaved caspase 3 (5AE1), and \u03b2-actin (13E5) were purchased from CST or ABCAM. Briefly, the quantified protein samples were subjected to an SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a PVDF membrane. After incubating with primary antibodies at 4 \u25e6C overnight and secondary antibodies at room temperature for 2 h, the membrane was illuminated with ECL solution and the density was analyzed using Image J [41].\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6796 5 of 15\n2.2.8. Xenograft Model and In Vivo Study\nThe BALB/c nude mice (female, 6\u20138 weeks, 18\u201320 g) were purchased from Nanjing Junke Biological Co., LTD. (Nanjing, China). Animal welfare and experimental procedures were followed according to the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) and the system guidance of the Anhui University of Science and Technology Animal Management Committee. Briefly, HepG2 cells were washed with PBS and the suspension (2 \u00d7 106 cells in 0.1 mL) was injected into the right flank of nude mice. The treatment was initiated when the tumor volume reached approximately 100 mm3 and mice were randomly divided into 3 groups: the control group (5 rats), the curcumin group (5 rats), and the G2 group (5 rats). The compounds at the desired concentration in olive oil were intravenously injected at a frequency of one dose per day. Body weights and tumor volumes were measured every 3 days and tumor volumes were calculated using the following formula: 0.5 \u00d7 L \u00d7 (W)2, where L and W are the length and width of the tumor mass, respectively [42].\n2.2.9. H&E Staining Analysis\nLiver tissues from different model groups were isolated and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. After being dehydrated using ethanol and xylene, the liver tissue was embedded in paraffin using a tissue embedding machine. Subsequently, the paraffin-fixed tissue samples were sliced to a thickness of 4\u20135 \u00b5m, and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed [43]."

The derivatives G1\u2013G7, curcumin, mono-carbonyl curcumin, and endogenous ligand were docked by standard precision (SP), extra precision (XP) glide, and flexible dock according to the protocols. As shown in Table 1, the docking score of G1\u2013G7 to AKT protein was stronger than endogenous ligand, mono-carbonyl curcumin, and curcumin, playing a pivotal role in protein inhibition and stability no matter the SP or XP method. Importantly, the docking score of G2 was the highest among all of the derivatives, which was consistent with the result of the MTT assay. As shown in Figure 3, compound G2 was well extended into the active pocket, which was consistent with the result of the MTT assay and docking score. G2 was bound to key residues GLU85 (2.5 \u00c5), ARG273 (2.7 \u00c5), and GLY294 (2.6 \u00c5) of AKT through intermolecular hydrogen bonds and formed \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking with key residue TRP80.

As shown in Figure 4A\u2013C, the cell monolayer was incubated with curcumin derivatives G1\u2013G7 at three concentrations of 5, 10, and 15 \u00b5M for 48 h. Curcumin and sorafenib (Sora) were used as positive controls. It was obvious that most of these compounds exhibit more potent toxicity in HepG2 cells when compared with the blank control (only cells sap added group) and the curcumin group. Remarkably, derivative G2 was the most active at different doses and may be chosen for further studies. The structure\u2013activity relationship (SAR) was discussed briefly: (1) substituents on the C-4 position of the benzyl rings exhibited more effective inhibitory activity than the substituents on the C-2 position comparing G2 to G6; (2) the contribution of the inductive effect of the halogens (such as F, Cl, Br) to anticancer activity was demonstrated by the differences in the activity of compounds G2, G3, and G4 with compounds G1, G5, and G6; (3) introducing a carbon ring caused a more significant inhibition than a heterocyclic ring, comparing G1 with G7. The preliminary results could lay the foundation for further structure optimization, and more curcumin derivatives should be synthesized to enrich the SAR. As shown in Figure 4D, the cells were treated with G2 with different concentrations (0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 \u00b5M) for 48 h. The IC50 values of G2 and curcumin were 15.39 and 40.56 \u00b5M, respectively, and the anti-proliferation activity of G2 was about 2.64 times higher than that of curcumin. As shown in Figure 4E, the clone formation assay also displayed that G2 (0, 1, 2, 4 \u00b5M) inhibited the clone formation ability of HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner for 48 h. The results of MTT and clone formation assay indicated that G2 exhibited promising anti-proliferation activity in HepG2 cells."

When the tumor volumes reached approximately 100 mm3, the mice were randomized into three groups with five ice in each group. Taking an injection of saline as the solvent vehicle control, curcumin (5 mg/kg) and G2 (5 mg/kg) of 200 \u00b5L were injected into mice intraperitoneally administered every day for 21 days. The body weight (Figure 8A) and tumor volume of nude mice (Figure 8B) were recorded every three days. During treatment, all the animals in different treatment groups were kept at relatively stable body weights, suggesting the low toxicity of G2. When the tumors were dissected and weighed after compound treatment, the inhibition rate of the average tumor volume of G2-treated mice (53.61%) was significantly better than curcumin (30.41%) (Figure 8C). Then, H&E staining of rat liver cells was conducted to observe the difference in cell morphology in different groups of tumor tissues.

The results showed that G2 exerted greater potential than curcumin against liver cancer in in vitro studies. Additionally, data from the HepG2 cell xenograft model and H&E staining suggested that the curcumin derivative G2 had a superior therapeutic impact on tumor development. All in all, G2 was discovered and identified as a potent anti-hepatoma agent and a new curcumin-like candidate, to be further evaluated in subsequent studies.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28196796/s1, Figure S1: 1H-NMR spectrum of compound 2; Figure S2: 13C-NMR spectrum of compound 2; Figure S3: 1H-NMR spectrum of compound G1; Figure S4: 13C-NMR spectrum of compound G1; Figure S5: 1H-NMR spectrum of compound G2; Figure S6: 13C-NMR spectrum of compound G2; Figure S7: 1H-NMR spectrum of compound G3; Figure S8: 13C-NMR spectrum of compound G3; Figure S9: 1H-NMR spectrum of compound G4; Figure S10: 13C-NMR spectrum of compound G4; Figure S11: 1H-NMR spectrum of compound G5; Figure S12: 13C-NMR spectrum of compound G5; Figure S13: 1H-NMR spectrum of compound G6; Figure S14: 13C-NMR spectrum of compound G6; Figure S15: 1H-NMR spectrum of compound G7; Figure S16: 13C-NMR spectrum of compound G7.\nAuthor Contributions: W.C.: Conceptualization, Methodology, Validation, Investigation, Writing\u2014 original draft.
