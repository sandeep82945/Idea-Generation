Organoid engineering extends this to create more 28 extensive synthetic tissues. We aim to merge morphogenesis, assembloid technology, 29 and biomatrices to advance tissue engineering. Our methods aid in modeling liver 30 organogenesis and establishing guidelines for synthetic tissue construction. 31 32 ABSTRACT: 33 Chronic liver disease has reached epidemic proportions, affecting over 800 million people 34 globally. The current treatment, orthotopic liver transplantation, has several limitations. 35 Promising solutions have emerged in the field of liver regenerative medicine, with liver 36 organogenesis holding significant potential. Early liver organogenesis, occurring between 37 E8.5 and 11.5, involves the formation of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions leading to 38 morphogenesis, hepatic cord formation, and collective migration. However, there is a lack 39 of methods for in vitro modeling of this process. In this study, we present a detailed series 40 of methods enabling the modeling of various stages and aspects of liver organogenesis. 41 In one method series, we utilize assembloid technology with hepatic and mesenchymal 42 spheroids, which replicate early structures found in liver organogenesis, model early 43 morphogenesis, and demonstrate interstitial cell migration as seen in vivo. These 44 innovative assembloid systems help identify factors influencing assembloid formation and 45 migration. Hepatic spheroid cultivation systems were also employed to model collective 46\n.CC-BY-NC 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Fibroblast-conditioned media play a significant 47 role in initiating dose-dependent branching migration. Future work will involve high 48 temporal and spatial resolution imaging of hepatic and mesenchymal interactions to 49 determine the cascade of cellular and molecular events involved in tissue formation, 50 morphogenesis, and migration. 51 52 INTRODUCTION: 53 Liver cell migration plays a significant role in liver organogenesis, disease, and cell 54 therapy. During liver organogenesis (E8.5-9.0, mouse), the ventral foregut pre-hepatic 55 epithelium begins to express liver genes, due to the inductive signals emanating from the 56 surrounding mesenchyme and heart. At E9.0, the foregut epithelium thickens as the cells 57 transition from a cuboidal to a pseudostratified columnar morphology, to form the liver 58 diverticulum (Gualdi, Bossard et al. 1996); (Bort, Signore et al. 2006). At this critical 59 stage, the liver diverticulum is comprised of only ~1,500 cells. Next, the hepatic 60 endoderm lining the liver diverticulum thickens, delaminates, and forms cords of 61 hepatoblasts that co-migrate with endothelial cells and mesenchymal cells and branch 62 into the surrounding mesenchymal tissue, thus initiating three-dimensional collective cell 63 migration to form the liver bud (Ogoke, Oluwole et al. 2017); (Ogoke O. 2022). In fact, 64 during this stage, the cells collectively undergo; 1) co-migration, or movement together 65 with other cell types, 2) branching morphogenesis or formation of branching tube-like 66 structures, and, 3) interstitial migration, or migration on top of other cells. By E11.5, 67 migration ceases, the primitive liver has formed and has expanded 103-fold (Ogoke O. 68 2022). Liver cell migration may also be required in later stages of liver organogenesis, 69 as rat fetal hepatoblasts (HBs) expression have shown evidence of highly upregulated 70 genes associated with 3D collective cell migration, morphogenesis, and extracellular 71 matrix remodeling (Petkov, Kim et al. 2000). In addition to its role in early liver 72 organogenesis, 3D collective migration is intricately linked to the local spread and 73 metastasis of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), ultimately leading to worsened 74 prognosis and increased treatment resistance (Yang, Chen et al. 2009). Adult and fetal 75 hepatocytes also employ collective migration when moving from the spleen to within the 76 liver during liver repopulation; in vivo imaging studies have demonstrated that 77 transplanted hepatocytes enter the portal vein and then the capillaries within hours, 78 migrate across the liver sinusoids, and through the liver tissue (Rajvanshi, Kerr et al. 79 1996);(Gupta, Rajvanshi et al. 1999);(Koenig, Stoesser et al. 2005). Finally, recent 80 studies demonstrate that migrating hepatoblasts arise during murine and human liver 81 regeneration with some evidence of movement in sheets (Matchett KP 2023). Overall, 82 liver collective migration, capable of multiple modes of morphogenesis, plays a significant 83 role in organogenesis, cancer, hepatocyte cell therapy, and liver regeneration. 84 85 Numerous genetic studies have investigated the molecular pathways that drive 3D liver 86 collective cell migration. These studies demonstrate that ablation of the hepatic cords 87 blocks liver formation and demonstrates that therefore, formation of hepatic cords and 88 their ensuing interactions with supporting cells are required for liver formation (Bort, 89 Signore et al. 2006); (Suzuki, Sekiya et al. 2008); (Sosa-Pineda, Wigle et al. 2000, 90 Matsumoto, Yoshitomi et al. 2001). These studies also demonstrate that liver growth is 91 initiated by fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) secreted from the cardiac mesoderm, BMP4 92\n.CC-BY-NC 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Overall, genetic studies support the fact 95 that soluble factor signaling with transcription factor expression is responsible for driving 96 migration, signaling, and molecular interactions between hepatoblasts and their 97 surrounding mesenchyme. 98 99 Although cell migration in early liver organogenesis has been extensively investigated, 100 the current in vitro hepatic migration studies frequently utilize 2D assays consisting of 101 highly migratory HCC cells combined with in vivo tumor models (Ng, Tung-Ping Poon et 102 al. 2013). These studies have provided insight into several factors that play a role in 103 hepatic migration including TGFB1 (Fransvea, Angelotti et al. 2008) c-Myc (Zhao, Jian 104 et al. 2013), Yes associate protein (YAP) (Fitamant, Kottakis et al. 2015), goosecoid 105 (Xue, Ge et al. 2014), actopaxin (Binam\u00e9, Lassus et al. 2008), and miRNAs (Zeng, 106 Liang et al. 2016);(Chen, Liang et al. 2017);(Yang, Xu et al. 2017). Despite the 107 advancements in understanding the molecular mechanisms in 3D hepatic cell migration, 108 the fundamental mechanisms between 2D and 3D cellular migration are distinct which 109 suggests 2D assays have their limitations. Furthermore, these models typically do not 110 implement mesenchymal cell types, which are essential to migration/growth. There has 111 been progress in the development of 3D models for liver migration that incorporate the 112 supporting mesenchyme, however, they are solely focused on co-migration rather than 113 the different modes of collective migration. 114 115 The ability to form tissues from spheroids through various self-assembly and 116 morphogenetic processes enables the scientific study of synthetic tissues for applications 117 for drug development and screening, disease modeling, therapy, and other biomedical 118 and biotechnological applications. Here we present methodological details for several 3D 119 in vitro cultivation systems which were engineered to exhibit different modes of liver 3D 120 collective migration. These systems include the following: (1) co-spheroid culture with 121 hepatic and mesenchymal-derived spheroids in matrix, (2) spheroid matrix droplet 122 cultured with fibroblast conditioned medium, and (3) mixed spheroids (hepatic and 123 mesenchymal-derived cells). These systems enable robust modeling of liver 3D collective 124 migration which will improve our molecular and cellular understanding of liver 125 organogenesis, cancer, and therapy. 126 127 PROTOCOL: 128 129 1.

In this field, hPSC-derived organoids or spheroids, and cells can be converted 394 into more synthetic, complex, and larger tissues. To accomplish this, principles of 395 morphogenesis, tools like microfabrication, and biomatrices can be applied to cells and 396 spheroids to engineer these synthetic tissues more precisely (Figure 6). We present 397 several methods here with this theme in mind. 398 399 Effects of clustering on spheroid formation 400 The methods developed here were contingent upon successful 3D spheroid formation. 401 Spheroid formation is considered successful if cells fuse to form a full spheroid within five 402 to nine days. An early indication of successful spheroid formation is clustering of the cells 403 in the center of the well after centrifugation of the cultivation plate. Despite the significance 404 of clustering, spheroid formation did occur, but less frequently, when cells were initially 405 scattered rather than clustered, therefore demonstrating that successful spheroid 406 formation could still occur. Spheroid formation is considered unsuccessful if cells do not 407 spread and fuse together within nine days after plating. 408 Spheroids were cultured at two different sizes to perform this experiment; small 409 spheroids (S) were plated at a concentration of 1,500 cells per well and large spheroids 410\n.CC-BY-NC 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Hepatic spheroids compacted 411 and fully cultured by day five, irrespective of the spheroid size. The cell density per well 412 did not impact the rate at which the spheroid formed and had a significant difference in 413 spheroid size (Figure 7). In this case, it is important to observe an increase in opacity 414 which demonstrates thickening of the initial disc-shaped tissue, which is more translucent, 415 to a spheroid configuration, which has increased opacity. Unlike hepatic spheroids, 416 mesodermal-derived spheroids compacted within 24 hours irrespective of cell seeding 417 density as well. Notably, HFF/MRC-5 cells compact much tighter than HepG2-WT cells, 418 likely resulting in cell density having little impact on spheroid size. 419 420 Factors that affect hepatic and mesenchymal (mesodermal-derived) assembloid 421 formation 422 Hepatic and mesodermal-derived spheroids of varying sizes were cultured to determine 423 the effect of size on the compaction time of spheroid formation. Hepatic and mesodermal-424 derived spheroids were co-cultured in Matrigel (MG) or Collagen Gel (CG) at a 1:5 dilution 425 with complete growth medium or fibroblast-conditioned medium, to determine if matrix 426 and conditioned medium influences assembloid formation. Both cell types were dye-427 labeled prior to spheroid formation to demonstrate the interaction between spheroids. It 428 was observed that assembloid formation occurs irrespective of matrix and medium 429 (Figure 8). We studied the effects of CG, effects of MG, and effects of conditioned 430 medium (MRC-5 conditioned medium or MCM-5). We observed assembloid formation in 431 all cases, although the morphological details varied slightly (Figure 8). Details regarding 432 these images will be re-used in later figures. To determine the effects of inter-spheroid 433 distance on assembloid formation, distance was measured together with success of 434 assembloid formation. It was observed that the compaction time of an assembloid is 435 directly proportional to the initial distance of the hepatic and mesodermal-derived 436 spheroids (Table 1). 437 438 Building more complex assembloids with arm-like structures 439 Methods were also developed to build assembloids that have branching cords (Figure 440 9A). To accomplish this experimentally, hepatic spheroids are mixed with biomatrix (MG), 441 in 384-well plate, and surrounded by single fibroblasts at high density. These fibroblasts 442 cluster and provide guides to which hepatic cells migrate towards and thicken, forming 443 thick cords over time. Hepatic spheroids were cultivated in the MG droplet system 444 containing a high density of MRC-5 cells (300,000 cells) in 384-wells and demonstrated 445 small clusters of MRC-5 cells that formed in the MG (Figure 9B, days 3-4). Next, the liver 446 spheroids formed thick migrating strands protruding out to the fibroblast clusters forming 447 thick strands containing both cell lines (Figure 9B, days 9-12). This approach led to 448 longer arms or cords, likely containing a mix of hepatic and fibroblast cells. Another 449 approach involved building bridges or small interconnections (arms) between spheroids. 450 To build small armed structures, a larger HEP spheroid can be co-cultured in 384-well 451 plate with a smaller mixed spheroid (Figure 9C). This leads to small, knob-like arms. 452 Overall, we present two approaches for forming additional arms to spheroids. 453 454 Spot-welding (fused edges) of complex assembloids 455 Methods were used to build assembloid with fused edges.

In M-CM, and CG conditions, the addition of MES and HEP 465 spheroids results in a different type of fusion in which we observe an infiltrative pattern 466 (Figure 9H). Further, we can obtain a layering pattern by placing single MES (human 467 mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC)) in MG at high density and allowing them to migrate 468 towards a HEP spheroid and layer on the surface without infiltration, as shown with dye 469 labeling of the hMSC (Figure 9I). We note that this is a different phenotype than when 470 we employed HFF. This latter arrangement is observed in the liver diverticulum stage and 471 many other endoderm-derived tissues. Here we present two approaches that are relevant 472 for modeling of the developing liver diverticulum and for creating aspects of synthetic 473 tissues. 474 475 Fused hepatic and mesenchymal (mesodermal-derived) assembloid formation 476 The fusion of two spheroids to form assembloids are critical for modeling the liver 477 bud. This is because when two spheroids fuse, the cells likely migrate on top or between 478 other cells, which we term interstitial migration. Interstitial migration occurs in the liver 479 bud, when early migrating hepatoblasts migrate through mesenchyme, potentially on top 480 of other cells. Therefore, fusion of two spheroids is a model of interstitial migration which 481 occurs during liver organogenesis. Methods were developed to build assembloids that 482 fuse completely with separate layers (Figure 10A). HEP and MES (MRC5 fibroblasts) 483 spheroids in MG form a fused assembloid by day 9 (Figure 10B). Dye-labeling analysis 484 demonstrated that MES tissue remained inside, while the HEP tissue remained outside 485 (Figure 10C). Importantly, the final spheroid is approximately the same size as the 486 original spheroids. This suggests that the cells are packed at high density. Notably, the 487 same phenomena occur in the absence of MG in 384-well plates, when multiple MES 488 spheroids are placed with a single HEP spheroid (Figure 10D). HEP-MES assembloids, 489 in the absence of matrix, also form under low serum (2% FBS) and extremely low serum 490 (0.2% FBS) conditions (Figure 10E). We then determined that large distances 491 (approximately 3 diameters of the spheroid), assembloids did not form (Figure 10F). To 492 determine how spheroid composition determines spheroid fusion, we demonstrated that 493 mixed spheroids (containing MES and HEP cells) can fuse with MES spheroids by day 5, 494 accompanied by an increased packing density, as expected (Figure 10G). 495 496 Partially fused or cupping in complex assembloid formation 497 Successful assembloid formation in MG demonstrates several phenotypes, 498 including the observation that the HEP spheroid undergoes \u201ccupping\u201d of the MES 499 spheroid to form a partially fused assembloid (Figure 10H). This also establishes a visual 500 model of interstitial migration, and points toward the current mechanism of fused 501 assembloid formation. Time series studies of HEP and MES spheroids demonstrate with 502\n.CC-BY-NC 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

This is further demonstrated 503 using dye-labeling (Figure 10J). Finally, the same phenomena is clearly illustrated when 504 multiple HEP spheroids are used with a large, single MES spheroid (Figure 10K). The 505 data suggests that cupping without fusion can occur in MG or in cases where the MES 506 spheroid is much larger than the HEP spheroids. 507 508 Induced hepatic branching and linear migration via mesenchymal (mesodermal-509 derived) conditioned growth medium 510 Collective migration is a key morphogenetic process during liver organogenesis. 511 Here we describe tools for inducing collective migration in vitro. Successful droplet 512 formation of HEP spheroids and utilization of M-CM (MES-conditioned media) 513 demonstrate outgrowth branching from the HEP spheroids (Figure 11A-B). HEP 514 spheroids cultivated in the MG droplet system demonstrated that M-CM induces collective 515 migration, and the data demonstrates a concentration-dependent effect (Figure 11B, 516 right). Cellular strands protruding from the hepatic spheroid are present with small 517 branching, thick strands, and multiple levels of branching (Figure 11B, left). On day 11, 518 the protrusions were increased with inter-connections and sheet formation (Figure 11B, 519 right). M-CM is potent, as a 1:7 dilution or M-CM present for one day still leads to 520 migration (Figure 11B, right). It was hypothesized that the M-CM induced cell migration 521 via TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway. A83-01, a TGF\u03b2 pathway inhibitor, was incorporated into 522 the M-CM at varying concentrations, and migration was significantly inhibited in a dose-523 dependent manner (Figure 11C). To determine the effects of extracellular matrix on 524 collective migration, HEP spheroids cultivated in the CG droplet system demonstrate that 525 M-CM induces cell migration. However, the protrusions were thin linear strands and less 526 branching by day 7 compared to the migration observed in MG (Figure 11D). We also 527 tested fibrin hydrogels, and we observed thin, hair-like, narrow, radial protrusions of both 528 HEP and MES cells (Figure 11E). 529 530 Inducing hepatic co-migration via MES conditioned medium 531 Mixed spheroids (HEP-MES spheroids) were also employed for collective 532 migration, as a model of co-migration which occurs during early liver organogenesis 533 (Figure 11F). These mixed spheroids in MG result in migration, and when TGF\u03b21 growth 534 factor was added, it resulted in significantly increased collective migration (Figure 11G). 535 Thus, co-migration can also be modeled with mixed spheroids. 536 537 FIGURE AND TABLE LEGENDS: 538\nFigure 1.

Hepatic spheroids and 692 mesodermal-derived spheroids were transferred to an agarose-coated well. The cells 693 were dye-labeled prior to spheroid formation to demonstrate the interaction between 694 spheroids. The spheroids were suspended in a 1:5 solution of the matrix (Matrigel or 695 Collagen) and cDMEM or fibroblast-conditioned media (M-CM). The initial distance 696 between the spheroids was measured using ImageJ and the corresponding compaction 697 time of the assembloid formation was observed. The compaction time of assembloid 698 formation is directly proportional to the initial distance between the spheroids, irrespective 699 of the matrix or media. 700 701 DISCUSSION: 702 In this protocol, several methods are presented for cultivating simple and complex 703 assembloids, and methods for inducing 3D collective cell migration in early liver 704 organogenesis. We have presented several protocols many of which have critical steps. 705 Spheroid formation is a critical step in the process in all these methods. Spheroid 706 formation can be accomplished using microwells (96- or 384-wells) with either non-707 adherent or agarose-coated plates. Considerable expertise is needed to handle 708 organoids regarding formation of spheroids (or organoids), transferring between wells, 709 addition of biomatrices upon spheroids, and addition of multiple spheroids per well. 710 Formation of the spheroids requires critical attention to repeatable cell counting and 711 seeding, agarose coating (or non-adherent), regular medium changes, dye-labeling 712 methods, and gentle handling of spheroids and plates together with microscopy. We also 713 note that dye-labeling should be experimentally determined in terms of cell number and 714 type, and amount of labeling time. 715 716 For example, preparation of agarose solution must be stringent in terms of maintaining 717 appropriate concentrations and seeding wells with appropriate volumes, such that a 718 meniscus (curvature develops) and enables collection of cells in the center. We 719 recommend careful attention to agarose concentration, volumes, and solidification of gel. 720 Determining correct micropipette tip size and transferring techniques is critical for proper 721 handling of spheroids. Glass wells can be used for improved visualization. As we have 722 noted in the paper, spheroids can first appear as translucent discs that become more 723 opaque over time, which can be used to monitor spheroid formation, and several factors 724 affect this time. Finally, assembloid formation requires careful transfer of spheroids, and 725 they need to be placed within a couple of spheroid diameters or less to effectively observe 726 changes. 727 728 Here, using cell lines, a toolbox of methods to develop complex assembloids and 729 migrating spheroids have been created. It is important to note that cell lines were 730 employed. While this enabled focus upon methods, using primary cells or hPSC-derived 731 cells would be advantageous with the use of human personalized tissues.

A significant 733 limitation of these systems is the matrix. Matrigel, a mouse tumor extracellular matrix 734 protein mixture, is primarily used as the matrix in these cultivation models. However, it is 735 a major limitation due to its tumor-derived origin and high cost. Furthermore, the droplet 736 formation system can only last 2 weeks before significantly degrade, and thus alternative 737 gels could be implemented such as collagen mixtures or sodium alginate. Furthermore, 738 the current systems can only grow to on the order of dimensions of the spheroids, but not 739 beyond. Thus, determining and addressing limitations to growth is critical. 740 741 There is a lack of methods to specifically study early events in early liver organogenesis, 742 and more generally, methods to generate synthetic tissues. The methods developed here 743 address this gap. With further study and characterization, he assembloids and tissues we 744 generate can be used to build larger tissues that can be used for improved modeling of 745 solid tissues and organs. This is not currently possible using current techniques. 746 747 These methods provide a toolbox that can be used to further build assembloids and 748 assemble larger, more complex tissues for better ex vivo organ modeling, and potentially 749 for in vivo therapeutic approaches, in addition to modeling structures during 750 organogenesis (liver bud) and being employed for biopharma applications. 751 752 The protocols we develop here enable models of different modes of liver cell migration 753 such as, co-migration, interstitial migration, and branching morphogenesis, as well as 754 assembloids that, together, can be used to build more complex tissues for various 755 biomedical and biopharma applications. 756 757 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS: 758 NP was supported by the UB CBE startup funds, a Mark Diamond Fellowship, the New 759 York State Stem Cell Science C024316, the UB the Stem cells in regenerative medicine 760 (ScIRM) center, the University at Buffalo Center for Cell, Gene, Tissue Engineering 761 (CGTE). 762 763 DISCLOSURES: 764 NP is the founder of Khufu Therapeutics, an organoid engineering company that develops 765 treatments for acute and chronic liver disease. 766 767 REFERENCES: 768 Binam\u00e9, F., P.
