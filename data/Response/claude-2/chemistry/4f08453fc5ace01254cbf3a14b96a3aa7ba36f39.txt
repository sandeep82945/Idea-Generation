 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Test the cell-penetrating peptides in different cell types like intestinal epithelial cells, immune cells, etc. to see if they can enter other physiologically relevant cell types.

2. Investigate if the peptides have other anti-inflammatory effects besides NF-kB, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, like effects on other cytokines or inflammatory pathways. 

3. Explore whether the peptides have intracellular effects once inside cells, such as interactions with signaling proteins, DNA/RNA, etc.

4. Examine if the peptides can act as carriers to transport therapeutic cargos into cells. Test attachment of small molecules or nanoparticles to the peptides.

5. Study the peptides in animal models of inflammatory diseases like colitis to determine if they have anti-inflammatory effects in vivo when administered orally.
