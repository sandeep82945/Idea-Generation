    "abstractText": "Background and Objective Corticosteroids are used to treat the early stages of idiopathic facial paralysis (Bell\u2019s palsy) in ch ildren, but their effectiveness is uncertain. We set out to determine if prednisolone improves the proportion of childre n with Bell\u2019s palsy with complete recovery at one month. Methods We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, ra ndomised trial of prednisolone in children presenti ng to emergency departments with Bell\u2019s palsy. Patients a ged 6 months to less than 18 years, recruited withi n 72 hours after symptom onset, were randomly assigned t o receive 10 days of treatment with oral prednisolo ne (approximately 1 mg/kg) or placebo. The primary out c me was complete recovery of facial function at 1 month rated on the House\u2013Brackmann scale. Secondary outco mes included facial function, adverse events and pa in up to 6 months. Target recruitment was n=540 (270 per group). Results Between 13 October 2015 to 23 August 2020, 187 chil dren were randomised (94 to prednisolone and 93 to placebo) and included in the intention-to-treat ana lysis. At 1 month, the proportions of patients who had recovered facial function were 49% (n=43/87) in the pr dnisolone group compared with 57% (n=50/87) in the placebo group (risk difference -8.1%, 95% CI -22.8 to 6.7; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.7, 95% CI 0.4 t o 1.3). At 3 months these proportion were 90% (n=71/79) for th e prednisolone group versus 85% (n=72/85) for the placebo group (risk difference 5.2%, 95%, CI -5.0 t o 15.3; aOR 1.2, 95% CI 0.4 to 3.0) and at 6 months 99% (n=77/78) and 93% (n=76/82) respectively (risk diff erence 6.0%, 95% CI -0.1 to 12.2; aOR 3.0 95% CI 0. 5 to 17.7) There were no serious adverse events and litt le evidence for group differences in secondary outc omes.",

            "text": "Bell\u2019s palsy or acute idiopathic lower motor neurone facial paralysis is characterised by sudden onset paralysis or weakness of the muscles to one side of the face controlled by the facial nerve.1 Population-based data from Northern California in children up to 18 years of age report an overall incidence rate of Bell\u2019s palsy of 18.8 per 100,000 person-years with incidence increasing withage, and higher in females.2 In an emergency department (ED) based study of stroke mimics in children,3 Bell\u2019s palsy was the third most frequent diagnosis in those with sudden onset neurological dysfunction.\nIn adults, up to 30% of untreated patients with Bell\u2019s palsy fail to make a complete recovery and may experience motor synkinesis.4 In children, while 90% to 100% recover from Bell\u2019s palsy within 12 months, there is frequently a prolonged period of functional impairment, disfigurement and emotional distress.4-8\nThe main agents used for the treatment of Bell\u2019s pal y re corticosteroids such as prednisolone. The antiinflammatory effect of corticosteroids is assumed to minimise facial nerve swelling, compression and damage within the temporal bone, therefore reducing the time to recovery and increasing the likelihood of ultimate complete recovery.1,9 Two large, blinded randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of corticosteroids in adults10,11 (combined n=1,309) and a meta-analysis9 reported statistically and clinically significant improvements in the proportion of patients who reached complete recovery when treated with steroids compared with placebo.\nCopyright \u00a9 2022 American Academy of Neurology. Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited\nDespite the conclusive evidence of benefit from corti steroids in adults with Bell\u2019s palsy, there has only been one small RCT of corticosteroid use in children with Bell\u2019s palsy where 42 children received corticosteroids or no treatment.6 Although all children fully recovered within 12 months regardless of treatment, corticosteroids appeared to hasten the time to recovery. The lack of a placebo, small patient numbers, and inclusion of only children with severe signs and symptoms at presentatio limit the generalisability of these results. The lack of evidence on the utility of steroids in children with Bell\u2019s Palsy, has led to variable practice in their treatment.7,12,13\nWe set out to determine if prednisolone improves recov ry of facial function in children with Bell\u2019s palsy by undertaking a multi-center placebo-controlled randomised trial. Our research question was whether prednisolone increased the proportion of children with Bell\u2019s palsy with complete recovery of facial function at one month using the House-Brackmann scale compared to placebo.10,14"

Prednisolone (Redipred\u00ae) and matched placebo was donated by Aspen Pharmacare Pty Ltd (St Leonards, NSW, Australia) who played no role in study design, execution, analysis or manuscript writing. The study drugs (prednisolone or placebo) were supplied based on a pre-calculated weight-based table as a once daily dose (eTable 1).\nIn the event of the presentation of a child with suspected Bell\u2019s palsy, ED staff at participating site were asked to notify the senior medical doctor on duty who performed an initial assessment of potential eligibility. The pragmatic entry point into the study was the clinician decision to diagnose Bell\u2019s palsy, i.e. the point where the decision to use or not use steroids would occur in the clinical setting as well. If then thought to be eligible, the senior doctor or a member of the investigator team approached the participant and their parent/guardian(s) to inform them of the study, determine their interest in participating, confirmed eligibility and (where applicable) obtained written informed consent. The relevant clini al teams at each site received standardised, stuy pecific education based on centrally developed education materials. Following consent, demographics and relevant clinical and study information was collected. Following randomisation, ED clinicians administered the first dose of the study drug from the relevant study pack in the ED. The parent or guardian was then provided with the remaining study drug along with written instructions regarding dosing and storage.\nFourteen days after randomisation, the parent/guardian/participant received a phone call from the study team to assess medication compliance, adverse events and ongoing palsy symptoms. One month after randomisation, participants attended a visit at the study site where they had been recruited. If the participant was unable to attend the study site, this was completed via videoconferencing. A specialist clinician (a pediatric neurologist; otolaryngologist; pediatrician or emergency physician to accommodate site specific resources) reviewed the participant to exclude an alternative diagnosis for the Bell\u2019s palsy symptoms; determined House-Brackmann grade (the primary outcome) and the Sunnybrook scale of the Bell\u2019s palsy; determined the presence of synkinesis using the Synkinesis Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ), adverse events, ongoing palsy symptoms,\nCopyright \u00a9 2022 American Academy of Neurology.

A further follow-up assessment at 3 and 6 months was arranged for participants deemed at their previous visit not to be completely recovered (defined as a HouseBrackmann score greater than 1). Participants deemed to have complete recovery at a prior visit (at 1 or 3 months) were instead asked to complete the subsequent follow-up assessment via telephone or online.

We therefore powered the study to find an increase in the proportion with complete recovery from 60% in the placebo group to 72%. With 80% power at 5% significance this required 244 subjects in each treatment group or 270 per group (540 in total) to all w for 10% loss to follow-up at 1 month. Due to lower than expected recruitment we extended the study by a year from the original plan and increased the number of participating sites. Enrolment was stopped when funding expired; we did not achieve the planned sample size.\nData were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. Summaries of baseline and outcome variables are present d using the available data. Baseline characteristics are described by treatment group using median and interquartile range (IQR) for continuous outcomes and number and percentage for categorical outcomes. The primary outcome of complete recovery at 1 month post randomisation on the House-Brackmann scale is presented as the number and proportion in each treatment group, with a comparison between the groups presented as a difference in proportions and as oddratio (OR) from a logistic regression model adjusted for site, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for the hypothesis that there was no difference between the prednisolone and placebo group.\nParticipants who were deemed to have fully recovered according to the House-Brackmann scale (i.e., achieved a House-Brackmann score of 1) at the 1 month or subsequent visits were not required to attend the study site for the remaining study time points. These participants were assumed to be fully recovered at the later assessments and the House-Brackmann score at subsequent time points were set to 1.\nSimilarly, participants who were determined to be fully recovered on the Sunnybrook scale (score = 100) were assumed to have a score of 100 at later visits if the r score was missing. Multiple imputation was used to handle missing data for the primary analysis of all outcomes using a single (joint) imputation model for 1 month outcomes, and separate imputation models for 3 and 6 month outcomes, conducted using fully conditional specification with 50 imputed datasets.24 Binary variables were imputed using logistic regression, normallydistributed continuous variables using linear regression, non-normal continuous variables using predictive mean matching (k = 5), and multinomial logistic regression for nominal variables. Child sex, age, and weight, as well as time to treatment (<24h or \u226524h to 72h), ED site and baseline House-Brackmann score (severe = HouseBrackmann grade 5 or 6, non-severe = House-Brackmann grade 1 to 4) were included in the imputation model to improve the accuracy of the imputed values.

Of 188 participants enrolled and consented, 187 were randomised with one family withdrawing consent after enrolment and prior to randomisation. There were no further withdrawals of consent. One patient was enrolled and had received study drug but was later found to have had Bell\u2019s palsy previously and therefore was technically ineligible. This participant was followed up as per the protocol and was included in the analysis. One randomised participant received no drug after randomisation (refused study drug; included in analysis) and none received the incorrect study drug. Of the 187 children randomised 93 were assigned to prednisolone and 94 to placebo and all were included in the intentionto-treat analysis. Thirteen (7%) had no primary outc me recorded at 1 month, including the one participant who did not receive any study drug; therefore 174 (93%) were included in the complete case analysis.\nTable 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the study participants by treatment arm which were similar in terms of sex, time from onset of symptoms to treatmnt and House-Brackmann scores. Median age at baseline in the intention-to-treat population was 9.9 years (IQR 5.1 to 12.9), 51.9% were female, median time to treatment was 24.0 hours (IQR=11.5 to 48.0) and median House-Brackmann score at enrolment was 4 (IQR=3 to 4). Median age in children who received prednisolone was 11.1 years (IQR 5.2 to 14.0) and for those receiving placebo was 9.4 years (IQR 5.1 to 11.8).\nIn terms of medication compliance, 14 (7.5%) participants received less than all 10 required doses of study drug but at least one dose, five (2.7%) participants received more than 10 doses of study drug (with 4 receiving 1 or 2 extra doses). One participant received 20 doses of their study drug. Due to safety concerns, the randomisation code was broken, revealing that they had received pr nisolone, and the participant was placed on a steroid taper with uneventful recovery.

The participant was lost to follow up in terms of primary and secondary outcomes but included in the intention-totreat analysis. One participant developed bilateral Bell\u2019s palsy after completing the study drug (third of three where randomisation code was broken); MRI imaging confirmed Bell\u2019s palsy. The participant continued in the study. One participant developed Ramsey-Hunt syndrome post randomisation. The participant received an antiviral agent after completing the study drug andcontinued in the study.\nAt 1 month, the proportions of patients who had recov red facial function (House-Brackmann grade 1) (Table 2, Figure 2) were 49% (n=43/87) in the prednisolone group compared with 58% (n=50/87) in the placebo group (risk difference -7.4%, 95% CI -22.5 to 7.6; aOR 0.7, 95% CI 0.4 to 1.4). Data on recovery rates by age (<12 years or >12 years), time to treatment (<24h or >24h to 72h) and initial severity (House-Brackmann grade 5 or 6 vs. 1 to 4) are shown in eTable 2. Recovery in children <12 years at 1 month was 43% for prednisolone versus 60% for placebo (risk difference -16.0%, 95% CI -34.2 to 2.2; aOR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3 to 1.1) and in children >12 years 58% versus 50% respectively (risk difference 8.9%, 95% CI -18.2 to 35.9; aOR 1.4, 95% CI 0.5 to 4.3).\nAt 3 months the proportion of participants with complete recovery (House-Brackmann grade 1) was 90% (n=71/79) for the prednisolone group versus 85% (n=72/85) for the placebo group (risk difference 3.4%, 95%, CI -7.6 to 14.4; aOR 1.3, 95% CI 0.5 to 3.4) and at 6 months 99% (n=77/78) versus 93% (n=76/82) respectively (risk difference 5.1%, 95% CI -2.6 to 12.8; aOR 3.1 95% CI 0.5 to 20.2) (Table 3). Recovery in children >12 years was 94% versus 75% and 97% versus 84% in predisolone versus placebo at 3 months and 6 months respectively (eTable 2). Complete case analysis and a secondary sensitivity analysis adjusted for age, sex, baseline severity of facial nerve dysfunction and time to treatment showed similar results.\nA similar pattern of results was seen with complete r covery of facial function on the Sunnybrook scale (Table 2). Synkinesis and pain were very low at all time points over the 6 month follow up period (Table 3).\nAdverse events not attributed to the underlying disease or unrelated to disease or intervention are shown in Table 4.

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "We found that children with Bell\u2019s palsy generally have a good functional outcome with 57% of placebo participants having complete recovery at 1 month and 93% at 6 months. The study was underpowered with only 187 participants recruited versus the planned 540. Despite this we found little evidence that treatment with prednisolone within 72 hours of the onset of symptoms increased the rate of complete recovery of facial function at 1, 3 and 6 months by a clinically relevant amount.\nTwo major trials10,11 and a subsequent systematic review9 have indicated that corticosteroid use in adults is associated with improved outcome for Bell\u2019s palsy compared with placebo. Similar definitive evidence is not available for children and to date their care has often been extrapolated from adult data. Based on prior reviews there are no prior placebo-controlled trials of corti steroid use in children.6,26 There are numerous retrospective and prospective cohort studies, but the only randomised trial in children by Un\u00fcvar et al6 was single center and not placebo controlled. In that trial, while all children fully recovered within 12 months regardless of treatment, consistent with our trial, more children in the methylprednisolone group had recovered at 4 and 6 months compared with the no treatment group (86% vs 72% at 4 months and 100% vs 85% at 6 months).\nWe used the House-Brackmann scale to assess recovery of facial function similar to the two largest adult RCTs,10,11 and the prior RCT in children.6 The House-Brackmann scale is easily applied and widely used but there is some debate on the optimal scale to use in B ll\u2019s palsy and data on use in children are limited.6,10,11,27 The House-Brackmann scale provides a single global assessment, whereas the Sunnybrook scale provides a regionally weighted facial assessment including resting symmetry, degree of voluntary movement and synkinesis. Our study indicates that both Sunnybrook and House-Brackmann assessed complete facial recovery similarly (House-Brackmann 1 or Sunnybrook 100). In adults, complete recovery over all time points using the Sunnybrook is somewhat lower than with House-Brackmann.11\nCopyright \u00a9 2022 American Academy of Neurology. Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited\nIn adult RCTs of prednisolone versus placebo for the management of Bell\u2019s palsy a group difference of between 10-12% has been considered clinically meaningful.10 We powered our study to find an improvement of 12% with prednisolone treatment. Although not meeting our calculated sample size, mainly due to exclusion criteria of presentation after 72 hours and pre-treatment with prednisolone, the point estimate for the proportion with complete recovery was higher in the placebo group. In addition, the 95% CI around the difference betwen the groups for our primary outcome of complete recovery of facial paralysis measured via House-Brackmann at 1 month did not include a 10-12% improvement with prednisolone treatment (difference between groups -7.4%, 95% CI -22.5 to 7.6%). However, in this underpowered sample the 95% CI of all secondary outcomes measuring recovery of facial function (House-Brackmann at 3 and 6 months; Sunnybrook at 1, 3 and 6 months) all included the possibility of a 10-12% improvement. The results of these secondary outcomes suggest caution in interpreting the primary outcome result in isolation as evidence that prednisolone provides no clinical benefit in the management of Bell\u2019s palsy in children.\nThere is currently little evidence for the optimal prednisolone dose in children with Bell\u2019s palsy with doses reported from 0.5 mg/kg up to 2 mg/kg.13,26 We chose 1 mg/kg for 10 days which is consistent with two large adult RCTs which used 50 mg prednisolone daily for 10 days,10 or 60 mg prednisolone daily for 5 days then weaning over 5 days11 and the only other pediatric RCT used methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg/day (equivalent to 1.25 mg/kg/day prednisolone) for 10 days, then weaned over 3-5 days.6 In our study adverse events from this dose were limited to temporary behaviour changes and increased appetite.28\nBaseline facial pain in children with Bell\u2019s palsy was infrequent and mild if present, with few children having pain at follow up at any time point. Furthermore, fewer children developed synkinesis over the 6 month study period in either group than in adults.9 Together these findings indicate that Bell\u2019s palsy in children is a milder disease than that seen in adults, with morbidity prima ily confined to facial weakness and that recovery is considerably more rapid and more likely to be complete, thus reducing the need for treatment.\nThe decision to use prednisolone to treat Bell\u2019s pal y in children must also be considered in light of p tential side effects. While as expected, on the whole these wer mild in participants, in Bell\u2019s palsy there is the increased concern that corticosteroid use may mask facial paralysis as first presentation of an oncological diagnosis, both delaying diagnosis and potentially complicating management and prognosis.29 This event\nCopyright \u00a9 2022 American Academy of Neurology.

The potential effect of prednisolone on the oncological presentations should ensure that clinicians only use prednisolone in Bell\u2019s palsy in children when there is clear evidence of clinically meaningful efficacy.\nThe main limitation of the study was that it study was underpowered compared to the original sample size calculations which reduced our power to identify group differences in all outcomes and analyses. The main reasons patients were ineligible for inclusion were lat presentation to the ED (more than 72 hours after onset) and treatment with prednisolone by a general practitioner before presenting to the ED. Further limitations include that the study was conducted in EDs at mainly tertiary centers. If more severely affected patients were referred selection bias may have resulted in our trial recruiting more patients less likely to respond to steroids. In addition, while research and site clinical staff received standardised education for the study, we did not test for interrater reliability of clinician diagnosis of Bell\u2019s palsy or their use of the rating scales. Lyme disease, which does not exist in Australasia, can cause facial paralysis and may be an important consideration in early diagnostic and management decisions in patients conidered for a treatment in Lyme endemic areas.26,30\nDespite our insufficient sample size the 95% CIs around the effect size for the primary outcome of complete recovery from Bell\u2019s palsy at 1 month ranged from 22% in favour of placebo to only 6% in favour of prednisolone. There was also high spontaneous recovery by 6 months, low rates of morbidity from pain or synkinesis, clinical concern regarding prescribing of prednisolone in children with Bell\u2019s palsy that may represent the first presentation of an oncological diagnosis and concern regarding the use of prednisolo e in Lyme disease. Together these lead us to conclude that there is no more than a marginal likelihood that prednisolone is beneficial when used in Bell\u2019s palsy in children.\nWNL-2022-201093_etab --- http://links.lww.com/WNL/C272"
