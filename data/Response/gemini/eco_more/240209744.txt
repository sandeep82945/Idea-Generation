1. **Develop a test for Granger causality in quantiles that is robust to both structural breaks and heteroskedasticity.** The test proposed in the paper is robust to structural breaks, but it assumes that the error variance is constant. In practice, the error variance is often not constant, so a test that is robust to both structural breaks and heteroskedasticity would be more useful.
2. **Extend the test to allow for a more general class of structural breaks.** The test proposed in the paper assumes that the structural break is a single, abrupt change. In practice, structural breaks can be more gradual, so a test that allows for a more general class of structural breaks would be more useful.
3. **Develop a test for Granger causality in quantiles that is based on a different test statistic.** The test proposed in the paper is based on the supWald statistic. There are other test statistics that could be used, so it would be useful to develop a test that is based on a different test statistic.
4. **Apply the test to a real-world dataset.** The test proposed in the paper has been tested on simulated data, but it has not been tested on a real-world dataset. It would be useful to apply the test to a real-world dataset to see how well it performs.
5. **Develop a theoretical framework for Granger causality in quantiles.** The test proposed in the paper is based on a heuristic argument. It would be useful to develop a theoretical framework for Granger causality in quantiles that could justify the test.
