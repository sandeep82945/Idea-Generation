"Although there are reports on the mitigation of harmful algal blooms using SLs [16], there is currently no report on the use of lactone-type or acid-type SLs and exploration of the effects of different mixing ratios on cyanobacterial degradation. From the results above, the lactonic SLs seem to exhibit better antimicrobial activities than acidic SLs." 

"Therefore, further research directions include exploring the combination of SLs with clay for cyanobacterial control in diverse water environments [31,32]. For example, mixing SLs with clay can help sediment the cells to the bottom of the water while lysing them, utilizing the sedimentation capacity of the riverbed to reduce the contamination of cyanotoxin in the water. Additionally, the timing of using SLs to control cyanobacteria is preferably selected during months when cyanobacterial reproduction is slower, allowing for their control before a significant increase in cell proliferation occurs."
