    "abstractText": "The specific objective of the present work study is to propose an anisotropic slip boundary condition for three-dimensional (3D) simulations with adjustable streamwise and spanwise slip length by the discrete unified gas kinetic scheme (DUGKS). The present boundary condition is proposed based on the assumption of nonlinear velocity profiles near the wall instead of linear velocity profiles in a unidirectional steady flow. Moreover, a 3D corner boundary condition is introduced to the DUGKS to reduce the singularities. Numerical tests validate the effectiveness of the present method, which is more accurate than the bounce-back and specular reflection slip boundary condition in the lattice Boltzmann method. It is of significance to study the lid-driven cavity flow due to its applications and its capability in exhibiting important phenomena. Then, the present work explores, for the first time, the effects of anisotropic slip on the two-sided orthogonal oscillating micro-liddriven cavity flow by adopting the present method. This work will generate fresh insight into the effects of anisotropic slip on the 3D flow in a two-sided orthogonal oscillating micro-lid-driven cavity. Some findings are obtained: The oscillating velocity of the wall has a weaker influence on the normal velocity component than on the tangential velocity component. In most cases, large slip length has a more significant influence on velocity profiles than small slip length. Compared with pure slip in both top and bottom walls, anisotropic slip on the top wall has a greater influence on flow, increasing the 3D mixing of flow. In short, the influence of slip on the flow field depends not only on slip length but also on the relative direction of the wall motion and the slip velocity. The findings can help in better understanding the anisotropic slip effect on the unsteady microflow and the design of microdevices.",

            "text": "Surface characteristics play a critical role in designing and fabricating microfluidic devices. Superhydrophobicity is an important aspect of surface characteristics, which can significantly control flow and reduce drag [1\u201310]. Based on the knowledge of fluid mechanics, the no-slip boundary condition is valid at the solid\u2013liquid interface. However, the liquid slip velocity is observed on the superhydrophobic surface. Unlike gas slip caused by Knudsen effects, liquid slip is modelled with two strategies [11]: introducing the force that repels water in the multiphase system; and modelling the slip boundary condition. For the former strategy, the forces are not well understood and determined. Existing research recognizes the critical role played by the latter strategy; therefore, it is emphasized in the present work. The appropriate boundary condition is an important area in the simulation of fluid flows [12,13]. Recently, researchers have shown an increased interest in slip boundary conditions. For example, Min and Kim [14,15] directly modelled the hydrophobic wall with Navier\u2019s slip boundary condition by direct numerical simulation (DNS) based on the macroscopic Navier\u2013Stokes equations. However, the Navier\u2019s slip boundary condition cannot be\nEntropy 2022, 24, 907. https://doi.org/10.3390/e24070907 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/entropy\nEntropy 2022, 24, 907 2 of 34\nintroduced to the lattice-Boltzmann-based methods, because the lattice-Boltzmann-based methods track the particle distribution function instead of the macroscopic variables. The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is appropriate for simulating mesoscopic physics that are hard to describe macroscopically. It has the advantages of simple algorithms, natural parallelization, and saving computing costs for simulating microflow [16], which proves to be a promising tool. Slip boundary conditions have been proposed and employed in the LBM, such as bounce-back and specular reflection (BSR) [11,17], discrete full diffusive and specular reflection (DSR) [18,19], discrete full diffusive and bounce-back (DBB) [20,21], and tangential momentum accommodation coefficient (TMAC) scheme [22]. Coupled with Navier\u2019s slip model [23], liquid slip can be characterized and adjusted by slip length. With assumption of the 2D unidirectional flow at a lower Reynolds number, the relation between the slip length and combination parameter of the coupled schemes [24\u201326] is determined. However, it is not valid in three-dimensional (3D) flows and turbulent flows. Moreover, the slip should be considered in streamwise and spanwise directions [1]. Existing studies about rice leaves have found that the anisotropic groove-like microstructures can lead to the anisotropic slip behavior of water droplets on the surfaces [27\u201329]. More recent studies have considered superhydrophobic surfaces with randomly distributed textures in streamwise and spanwise directions [8,30\u201335], indicating that the slip is anisotropic. For example, both spanwise and streamwise slip lengths have been measured on a randomly textured superhydrophobic surface [35]. Therefore, the present study considers the anisotropic slip in streamwise and spanwise directions for the 3D system based on the nonlinear velocity profiles near the wall, which is close to the actual situation. Moreover, Guo et al. proposed a new finite-volume scheme named discrete unified gas kinetic scheme (DUGKS) based on the lattice Boltzmann equation [36]. The DUGKS has also been proved to be a promising numerical tool to simulate fluid flow [37\u201342], such as 3D turbulent channel flow. It is found that the DUGKS, even with a coarse nonuniform mesh, is overall better than the LBM [37]. So, the numerical simulation will be performed by the DUGKS in this work. Up to now, no attention has been paid to the 3D slip boundary condition in the DUGKS. Therefore, in the present study, the new slip boundary condition is proposed for the DUGKS instead of the LBM. The DUGKS is performed to simulate 3D flows with the proposed slip boundary condition. It is hoped that we provide a superior method to describe and characterize anisotropic slip on superhydrophobic surfaces. To study the effect of anisotropic slip on flows in benchmark geometries, the present method is applied to the lid-driven cavity flow. It is an important problem in the field of fluid mechanics due to its applications, such as cooling of electronic gadgets, oil extraction, design of heat exchangers, solar ponds, acoustic liner, float glass productions, insulation materials, multiscreen gadgets for nuclear reactors, coating, food processing, crystal growth, etc. [43\u201349]. Moreover, it has capability in exhibiting important phenomena such as eddies, secondary flows, instabilities, transition, and turbulence [50]. The liquid slip flow in two-sided, orthogonal, oscillating, micro-lid-driven cavities has largely been oversighted. Recently, two-sided motion [51\u201354] and oscillatory flows in the cavity have also caught the necessary attention, except single-sided steady flows. The purposes of the literature cornering oscillatory flows in lid-driven cavities include: 1. To test and validate numerical solvers, such as least-squares finite element methods [55], Taylor-series-expansion- and least-squares-based lattice Boltzmann methods [56] and conservative level-set methods [57]. 2. To understand industrial applications, such as surface viscometer [58] and optimization of fluid mixing [59,60]. 3. To understand the flow characteristics, such as the single-sided oscillatory rarefied gas flows inside two- and three-dimensional cavities [61\u201363], and two-sided oscillating flows in two-dimensional lid-driven cavities [64]. The studies mentioned above have been solely restricted to the no-slip flow; the liquid slip flow in lid-driven cavities have largely been oversighted. Slip should be carefully considered in the design of micro-devices with moving parts.

            "text": "Then, the relation between combination parameters (\u03c3\u2032x, \u03c3\u2032y) and slip lengths (bx, by) is deduced to implement the new slip boundary condition. Previous research on the derivation of the relation is studied by taking the two-dimensional unidirectional steady flow as an example, which is expressed as [24\u201326]:\n\u03c1 = const, uy = 0, ay = 0, \u2202\u03c6\n\u2202x = 0,\n\u2202\u03c6 \u2202t = 0 (38)\nwhere \u03c6 denotes flow variable, such as the velocity or density. In this work, it is assumed that the anisotropic slip includes two components in streamwise and spanwise directions. Take the liquid slip on a horizontal plane (perpendicular to the z-axis) as an example. The slip length includes two components, bx, by in the x and y directions, respectively. With the assumption of anisotropic slip, the simulation and characterization of the slip effect on a superhydrophobic surface can match the actual situation. The upper wall in 3D is employed to derive the relationship between the parameters \u03c3\u2032x, \u03c3\u2032y and the slip lengths bx, by.\nThe flow near the wall satisfies the continuity equation:\n\u2202\u03c1 \u2202t + \u2202\u03c1ux \u2202x + \u2202\u03c1uy \u2202y + \u2202\u03c1uz \u2202z = 0 (39)\nEntropy 2022, 24, 907 9 of 34\nWith the assumption of no density change in the incompressible flow, the continuity equation can be written as,\n\u2202ux \u2202x + \u2202uy \u2202y + \u2202uz \u2202z = 0 (40)\nIn the 3D directional flows, the velocity distribution near the wall is assumed to be satisfied the following equations:\n\u2202ux \u2202y = 0, \u2202uy \u2202x = 0, uz = 0 (41)\nAs shown in Figure 2, the local coordinate system (x, y, z) in 3D is established in the lattice unit, where a node on the wall is served as the origin. The x\u2212 y plane is located on the wall. The z direction is normal along the wall. In the local coordinate system, the boundary of the upper wall is located at the plane z = 1, and the solid is located in the region (z < 1), e.g., the plane z = 0. As shown in Ref. [68], the measured velocity profiles across the channel with a parabolic fit are observed and recorded. Therefore, in this work, it is assumed that the nonlinear velocity profiles near the wall are parabolic in the z direction, conforming to the quadratic term fitting. The velocity profiles can be linear when the quadratic coefficient is 0. Then, the function of velocity profiles near the wall will be simplified as follows:\nux(x, z) = ux(x) + \u03b11z2 + \u03b21z + e1 (42)\nuy(y, z) = uy(y) + \u03b12z2 + \u03b22z + e2 (43)\nThe acceleration can be approximated by relations as follows [69]:\nax \u2248 \u2212\u03bd \u22022ux(x, z)\n\u2202z2 , ay \u2248 \u2212\u03bd \u22022uy(y, z) \u2202z2 . (44)\nThen, the coefficients can be obtained by the acceleration, \u03b11 = \u22120.5 ax/\u03bd, \u03b12 = \u22120.5 ay/\u03bd. The slip velocity can be expressed as:\nusx = ux(x, z)|z=1 \u2212UWx, usy = uy(y, z)|z=1 \u2212UWy. (45)\nThe slip velocity on a wall is characterized in the form of a Navier slip boundary condition in both the streamwise direction and the spanwise direction [35]:\nusx = bx \u2202ux \u2202z |wall , usy = by \u2202uy \u2202z |wall (46)\nConsidering Equations (42) and (43), (46) can be written as:\nusx = bx \u2202ux \u2202z |z=0 = bx\u03b21, usy = by \u2202uy \u2202z |z=0 = by\u03b22.

            "heading": "2.5. Corner Boundary Condition",
            "text": "The above discussion on boundary conditions focuses on straight surfaces. Considering the singularity, the treatment of corners should not be ignored in numerical simulations of the flow, such as the lid-driven cavity flow. Although corners account for only a few nodes, these corners should not be underestimated because the particle can stream in the fluid domain, which has influences on the performance of the numerical simulation. One single point may contaminate the numerical solution everywhere [71]. One of the earliest systematic approaches to treating corners in DUGKS was proposed by Guo et al. [72]. However, this approach is limited to 2D implementations. In this work, to reduce the singularities and improve the performance of numerical simulation, an approach to treating the corner boundary condition is proposed for the DUGKS based on the D3Q19 model with 19 independent moments [73].\n0th : \u03c1 = \u2211 i fi; 1st : \u03c1u\u03b1 = \u2211 i fi\u03bei\u03b1; 2nd : \u03a0\u03b1\u03b2 = \u2211 i fi\u03bei\u03b1\u03bei\u03b2; 3rd : Q\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 = \u2211 i fi\u03bei\u03b1\u03bei\u03b2\u03bei\u03b3; 4th : S\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 = \u2211 i fi\u03bei\u03b1\u03bei\u03b2\u03bei\u03b3\u03bei\u03b4. (68)\nThe 0th moment has 1 equation, the 1st moment has 3 equations, the 2nd moment has 6 equations, the 3rd moment has 6 equations, and the 4th moment has 3 equations.

Velocity profiles for W on the horizontal centerlines of plane at y/L = 0.5.\nSo, the spatial discretization with resolution 120 \u00d7 120 \u00d7 120 is used for performing\nsubsequent numerical simulations with two-sided orthogonal oscillating wall motions. To\nkeep Re = 400, U0lattice = 1.0/15 and the kinematic viscosity is set to \u03bdlattice = 0.02. The present\nslip boundary condition is applied to the top and bottom wall, and the corner boundary\ncondition is applied to four corner nodes in the cavity. The four side walls remain at rest\nwith the no-slip boundary condition.\n4.3. Results and Discussion\nThere are mainly two types of slip distribution: pure streamwise slip emerges on both\nthe top and bottom wall surfaces; and both streamwise and spanwise slips emerge on the\ntop wall surface.

The slip length bx has greater influence on U than by. It is found that velocity profiles in each group are very close. Therefore, for bx at the same level, the existence of by on the top or bottom wall has almost no influence on the change in U along the centerline Z-axis. The greater bx is, the greater the influence it has on the change in U along the centerline Z-axis for z/L < 0.9 (U < 0). For z/L > 0.9, U increases rapidly, and the closer the location is to the top wall, the faster U increases, and the greater the velocity gradient. When the curves intersect, the relative magnitude of the curves changes. The distribution of the intersection points is chaotic, as shown in the red circle in Figure 10. Therefore, when bx = 0.1, the promotion effect of by on increasing U will change with the change in of z.\nEntropy 2022, 24, 907 21 of 34\nEntropy 2022, 24, x FOR PEER REVIEW 24 of 41\nFigure 11.

As shown in Figure 11, U is negative along the centerline Y-axis in cases (c-n), which indicates that the existence of by on the top wall or bottom wall results in the negative U along the centerline Y-axis. The anisotropic slip on the top wall with a larger slip length has a greater influence on the negative U along the centerline Y-axis, such as case (l) and case (n).

Maybe there are more intersecting points near y/L = 0.5 and y/L = 0.915 because of the motion of the top and bottom walls and the interaction of the sidewalls and fluid.\nEntropy 2022, 24, 907 22 of 34tropy 2022, 24, x FOR PEER REVIEW 25 f 41\n. l rese t t e i ts of intersection.\nFigure 12 shows V (the velocity component in the Y direction) along the centerline Z-axis at t = T and its magnified view. As shown in Figure 12, the results of different slip combinations are relatively close with a slight difference, indicating that anisotropic slip has a minor influence on V along the centerline Z-axis. However, it can still be seen that the slip combination in case (l) has the greatest influence on V along the centerline Z-axis, where the absolute value of negative V is the largest, as shown in the magnified view. Near the top wall, the anisotropic slip in case (l) results in the maximum positive V. For z/L > 0.06554, the intersection points of the curves are mostly evenly distributed along the centerline Z-axis, indicating that the strong or weak influence of slip distribution on V will change at most positions along the centerline Z-axis. It may be caused by the time-dependent motion of both top and bottom walls. Maybe, in this condition, the velocity V is mainly influenced by the disordered flow driven by the walls, and the influence of slip on V is negligible. So, the effect of slip may be greatly reduced in the disordered flow.\nEntropy 2022, 24, 907 23 of 34 Entropy 2022, 24, x FOR PEER REVIEW 26 of 41\nFigure 13.

The slip condition makes the troughs closer to the center than the no-slip condition. Under the action of anisotropic slip, two peaks appear in the curve. The fluctuation range is large at large slip lengths, such as case (l) and case (n). Compared with pure slip in both top and bottom walls, anisotropic slip on the top wall results in stronger fluctuation disturbance and increases the 3D mixing of flow. The results of different slip combinations are similar near the side walls, and a great difference occurs in the cavity (0.2 < x/L < 0.8). The influence of slip on flow hardly propagates to the side walls, but mostly to the cavity.\nEntropy 2022, 24, 907 24 of 34ntropy 20 , , x FOR PEER REVIEW 27 of 41\nFigure 14.

For x/L \u2248 0.5, the direction of W reverses under the interaction of the top and bottom walls.

As shown in Figure 15, the large slip length will enhance the oscillation phenomenon of W along the centerline Y-axis and promote the increase in fluctuation amplitude, such as case (m) and case (n). This can be explained by the fact that the large slip length significantly increases the moving velocity of the wall. The existence of by on the top wall has a stronger effect on enhancing the amplitude of the left peak, and the existence of by on the bottom wall has a stronger effect on enhancing the amplitude of the right peak. The direction of by intersects with the motion direction of the top wall vertically, enhancing the disturbance of W near the left side wall; the direction of by is the same as the motion direction of the bottom wall, enhancing the disturbance of W near the right sidewall. So, the influence of slip on flow also depends on the slip direction and wall motion direction.\nEntropy 2022, 24, 907 26 of 34\nEntropy 2022, 24, x FOR PEER REVIEW 29 of 41\nFigure 16.

It is found that velocity profiles for U in each group are very close. Therefore, for bx at the same level, the existence of by on the top or bottom wall has almost no influence on the change in U along the centerline Z-axis. So, the direction of slip is also an important consideration. The larger bx results in a larger peak near the top wall, which has a greater influence on the change in U along the centerline Z-axis. When bx and by are fixed, the anisotropic slip on the top wall has a greater effect on the positive U than the pure slip on the top and bottom walls. This may be explained by the directional inconsistency. When U > 0, there is no intersection point in 14 curves, and with fixed bx = 1, larger by on the top wall results in larger U. With the existence of by on the top wall, the increase in velocity is facilitated. Figure 17 shows U (the velocity component in the X direction) along the centerline Y-axis at t = 0.25 T. As shown in Figure 17, the pure slip on the top and bottom walls makes the curve symmetrical, and the anisotropic slip on the top wall makes the trough closer to the right-side wall. The asymmetry can be caused by the direction of slip normal to the wall motion direction.\nEntropy 2022, 24, 907 27 of 34 Entropy 2022, 24, x FOR PEER REVIEW 30 of 41\nFigure 17.

The other five types of profiles at t = 0.5 T show some approximative mirror symmetry with those at t = T.

As shown in Figures S1, S5, S6, S10, S11 and S15 in the Supplementary Materials, the contour of vorticity magnitude is concentrated on the top and bottom walls, owing to shear stress affected by the motion of the top and bottom walls. As shown in Table 2, the maximum vorticity magnitude at t = T and 0.5 T is about an order of magnitude larger than that at t = 0.25 T, owing to the time-dependent oscillating velocity of the top and bottom walls. Compared to the no-slip case, the maximum vorticity magnitude in slip cases changes very little at t = T and 0.5 T, and the maximum percentage change is 3% in case (k).

            "text": "The present method is validated by simulating the microchannel flow in 3D. Compared with the reference data, the present method is more accurate than the bounce-back and specular reflection slip boundary condition in LBM in Ref. [11]. The effect of anisotropic slip boundary conditions on turbulent flow is investigated by considering different slip lengths in streamwise and spanwise directions. Good agreement with DNS results shows that the present method is also accurate and stable to simulate fluid slip on 3D hydrophobic microchannel walls in a turbulent flow. The present method is effectively accurate and stable to capture velocity profiles and predict drag changes to study the effect of anisotropic slip. Then, the present method is applied to the two-sided, orthogonal, oscillating, microlid-driven cavity flow. Some findings are obtained from the simulation results, which can help in better understanding the anisotropic slip effect on the unsteady microflow and the design of microdevices: The oscillating velocity of the wall has a weaker influence on W than on U and V. In most cases, large slip length has a more significant influence on velocity profiles than small slip length. However, for V along the centerline Z-axis at t = 0.25 T, the larger streamwise slip length on the top wall results in a smaller peak value with a fixed spanwise slip length. Compared with pure slip in both top and bottom walls, anisotropic slip on the top wall has a greater influence on flow, increasing the 3D mixing of flow. In short, the influence of slip on the flow field depends not only on slip length but also on the relative direction of the wall motion and the slip velocity.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/e24070907/s1.
