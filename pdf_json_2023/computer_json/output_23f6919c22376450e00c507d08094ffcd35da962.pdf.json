    "abstractText": "In this paper, the privacy of wireless transmissions is improved through an efficient technique termed dynamic directional modulation (DDM) and is subsequently assessed in terms of the measure of information leakage. Recently, a variation of DDM termed low-power dynamic directional modulation (LPDDM) has attracted significant attention as a prominent secure transmission method owing to its ability to improve the privacy of wireless communications. Roughly speaking, this modulation operates by randomly selecting the transmitting antenna from an antenna array whose radiation pattern is known. Thereafter, the modulator adjusts the constellation phase so as to ensure that only the legitimate receiver recovers the information. To begin with, we highlight some privacy boundaries inherent to the underlying system. In addition, we propose features that the antenna array must meet in order to increase the privacy of a wireless communication system. Last, we adopt a uniform circular monopole antenna array with equiprobable transmitting antennas in order to assess the impact of DDM on information leakage and the bit error rate (BER).",

In contrast to the traditional approach, which addresses information security through mathematically derived encryption techniques in the upper layers of the wireless network protocol stacks, PLS or information-theoretic security is implemented at the lowest layer of the Open System Interconnect (OSI) stack, i.e., the physical layer. It exploits the unique physical features of wireless propagation channels to prevent the information being obtained by unintended receivers through eavesdropping or malicious attacks [4]\u2013[7]. Owing to its promising benefits, PLS has been widely investigated in the literature as a potential candidate to safeguard fifth-generation (5G) and beyond wireless communications, complementing the encryption-based method. However, there are drawbacks associated with the PLS implementation, such as the significant memory consumption, which may impose strict requirements on wireless devices in the context of 5G technology [8].\nA recent PLS technique referred to as directional modulation (DM) (see [9]\u2013[12] and the references therein) has emerged as an efficient and secure transmission approach suitable for wireless communications, including millimeterwave (mmWave), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), satellite communication, and smart transportation [13], [14]. DM has the potential to steer the intended baseband information in the desired direction while transmitting distorted signals in other directions. Specifically, the original information-bearing signal is only transmitted in a narrow directive beam toward the intended user. The genesis of DM stems from [9], which uses phased arrays (PA) to improve security as long as the eavesdropper is not in the same direction as the legitimate receiver.\nRecent studies have revealed a high complexity for combining an antenna array with complex signal processing techniques. For instance, the authors in [15] propose a zero-forcing (ZF) technique to reduce the computational complexity of DM; although the proposed solution addresses the complexity issue, it comes at the expense of a large antenna array. The works [11], [16] propose means to miniaturize the antenna array but at the cost of hardware complexity since the system requires individual amplitude and phase control over each port and additional radio frequency (RF) chains. The authors in [17] synthesize multicarrier directional modulation symbols for PLS through a meticulous design of a time-switching sequence and time-modulated PA. However, this approach is impractical for Internet of Things (IoT) devices or other low-cost devices because of the high complexity deriving\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License. For more information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n2 from the synchronization with high-degree accuracy in the switching mechanism [18]. Similarly to [17], [7] proposes a practical and simplified scheme for IoT devices that provides energy efficiency and cost-effectiveness through a single RF chain and an array of closely spaced antennas. It requires a switchable antenna array and a random number generator at the transmitter, along with a simple receiver. Moreover, it does not introduce additional artificial noise in the direction of the legitimate receiver.\nDespite the growing interest in DM-based PLS transmission, the existing literature has evaluated only a few metrics. In [10], the authors assess error vector magnitude (EVM), bit error rate (BER), and secrecy rate (SR). EVM calculates the normalized mean of the square of the difference between the measured streams and the reference symbols in the in-phase and quadrature (IQ) space. It is commonly adopted to quantify the system performance without executing the demodulation process and to distinguish physical sources from distortion. Albeit BER, EVM, and SR are equivalent for dynamic DM systems under the assumption of a zero-mean Gaussian distributed orthogonal interference, the authors in [10] point out a discrepancy between such metrics for static DM systems. Recently, several studies have used BER or a variation of SR as a metric to evaluate the system performance [7], [8], [11], [19]. In [8], the system performance is evaluated in terms of average secrecy capacity (ASC), secrecy outage probability (SOP), and BER. It is worthwhile recalling the dependence of both the ASC and the SOP on the SR, which is intrinsically linked to mutual information. However, mutual information is not an adequate security metric1. A closely related work to our proposed study is [7], where a uniform circular array of monopole antennas with equiprobable transmitting antennas is proposed. In that work, Narbudowicz et al. show that the privacy of wireless communication can be achieved by randomly switching the transmitting antenna. Furthermore, the authors rely on BER as a performance metric to evaluate the privacy of the system.\nMotivated by the preceding discussion, our proposed work aims at adopting other performance metrics as a means to evaluate the security of a wireless communication system in terms of vulnerability. Our approach is prompted by the inefficacy of the BER (equivalent to EVM and SR for dynamic DM systems [10]) in conjunction with trivial demodulation\u2014this procedure has been widely adopted in the technical literature as a security performance metric for wireless communications, e.g., in [8], [11], [19] in gauging information leakage. To the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, our work is the first that adopts a theoretical approach to information and security for the DM scheme. The contributions of this work are as follows: \u2022 We highlight some privacy boundaries inherent to the\nunderlying system and provide insights into how an eavesdropper can intercept confidential information intended for a legitimate receiver. \u2022 We propose a design of an antenna array that minimizes the system vulnerability for an acceptable level of privacy. More precisely, we show that the system\n1This will be subsequently discussed in the manuscript.\nvulnerability can be significantly reduced for a large number of transmitting antennas. Moreover, we derive the fundamental limits of the system vulnerability. \u2022 We adopt a uniform circular monopole antenna array with equiprobable transmitting antennas and then evaluate its impact on the measure of information leakage. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the transmission of constellations can ensure privacy in the context of data confidentiality.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. The system model is described in Section II, and the proposed vulnerability approach is elaborated in Section III.

            "text": "The energy-efficient DM system proposed in [7] consists of a standard modulator, a phase delayer, a circular antenna array, and a random integer generator. The block diagram of the system and the phase displacement are presented in Fig. 1. The standard modulator block performs IQ modulation of the data. It is worth mentioning that phase-based modulation (e.g., M -ary phase-shift keying or quadrature amplitude modulation) represents the worst-case scenario for eavesdroppers to perform a successful attack; in brief, the security of the DM scheme is based on phase distortion, and thus, modulations whose information is not somehow contained in a phase are more susceptible to a successful attack. For the sake of simplicity, we assume that the phase displacement at the modulator output is null. Let \u03b8n(\u03d5) be the phase shift generated by the radiation pattern (including the displacement) of the nth antenna in the direction \u03d5. The phase delay rotates the symbol by \u03b8DM(\u03d5Bob, n) radians, with \u03d5Bob and n \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , N} being the direction of the legitimate (intended) receiver and the transmitting antenna, respectively. For the proposed DM scheme, this phase shift added to the phase delay block is given by\n\u03b8DM(\u03d5Bob, n) = \u2212\u03b8n(\u03d5Bob). (1)\nThe phase delay block works as a predistortion phase of the transmitted signal, which allows its correct reconstruction only along the intended direction \u03d5Bob. Therefore, the total phase shift at the receiver is given by\n\u03b8Rx(\u03d5, n) = \u03b8DM(\u03d5Bob, n) + \u03b8n(\u03d5) + \u03b8Ch,n, (2)\nwhere \u03b8Ch,n is defined as the phase shift of the channel between the nth antenna and the receiver, as indicated in Fig. 1. Hereafter, we will omit the \u03b8Ch,n dependence on the transmitting antenna n in order to simplify the notation. Note that \u03b8Ch,n\u2200n \u2208 1, 2, . . . , N are statistically identical. After substituting (1) into (2), it can be seen that the phase shift from the phase delay block and the antenna array cancel each other out in the direction \u03d5 = \u03d5Bob, leaving the phase shift at the legitimate receiver to be caused exclusively by\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

On the other hand, there is an additional phase component that changes as a function of the direction \u03d5, leading to the distortion of the transmitted signal for \u03d5 \u0338= \u03d5Bob\u2014with the severity of the distortion being dependent on the antenna array design.\nHowever, if the eavesdropper obtains information about the radiation pattern used, it can somehow compensate for the additional phase shift. The system aims to preclude this by randomly switching between different antennas in the array, i.e., it is the primary function of the random integer generator. In this way, the eavesdropper cannot squarely distinguish the phase artificially generated by the DM system from the phase modulation. Therefore, the system may provide a certain level of security for the secret information while transmitting via only one antenna at each given time; the other antennas of the array remain disconnected. Thus, we can use a single RF chain leading to a significant hardware simplification compared with other DM schemes [7]. Before the data transmission phase, most wireless systems require a handshake. Here, the transmitter and the legitimate receiver perform a handshake through a reference antenna nR, which is not used later for data transmission. Hereafter, we will assume that the antenna array is composed of N+1 antennas in such a way that we have the transmitting antenna n \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , N}; in the sequel, when referring to the antenna array, we allude to the N antennas usable in the transmission phase after the handshake.\nIn a nutshell, the transmission method consists of the following chronological sequence of actions: 1) modulate the data using any modulation pattern; 2) randomly select a transmitting antenna for each new symbol; 3) correct the symbol phase based on the drawn antenna; 4) transmit the symbol with the corrected phase.\nIn order to facilitate the visualization of the transmission procedure, we present Algorithm 1 that exemplifies how to generate L output symbols given L\u00d72 input bits with a QPSK modulation. Note that the legitimate receiver can trivially demodulate the received signal.\nIII. VULNERABILITY APPROACH\nIn this section, we briefly recall the concept of vulnerability as a measure of information leakage proposed by Smith in [20] (closely related to the Bayes risk). The measure of information\nAlgorithm 1 Complex symbol transmitted in the direction \u03d5 with the energy-efficient DM Require: Data \u2208 {0, 1}L\u00d72 Ensure: Symbol \u2208 CL \u03d5BOB \u03d5 for l = 1, . . . , L do\nantenna\u2190 rand \u2208 {1, . . . , N} \u03b8DM \u2190 phase(\u03d5BOB, antenna) \u03b8n \u2190 phase(\u03d5, antenna) Symbol[l]\u2190 QPSK(Data[l, :]) Symbol[l]\u2190 Symbol[l]\u00d7 exp(\u2212i(\u03b8n \u2212 \u03b8DM))\nend for\nleakage or vulnerability\u2014which is, in a way, the opposite of uncertainty\u2014uses R\u00e9nyi\u2019s min-entropy rather than Shannon entropy.\nIn the secure information flow analysis, the question that arises is whether a broadcast transmission could leak information about confidential data to unintended receivers. If there is indeed an information leakage, one of the main concerns is how to measure it. Intuitively, one can expect that initial uncertainty = information leaked + remaining uncertainty. This claim plainly suggests Shannon\u2019s traditional mutual information as the measure. However, [20] indicates that Shannon\u2019s mutual information may be inadequate to measure information leakage. A more efficient way to measure information leakage would be based on the notion of vulnerability and minentropy [20]. We briefly revise these concepts here.\nLet the triple (S,O,C) represent a discrete channel. S is a finite set of secret input values, O is a finite set of observable output values, and C is a |S|\u00d7|O| channel matrix such that the element ci,j in the ith row and the jth column represents the conditional probability of obtaining the ith element of O in the output given that the input is the jth element of S. Assuming any a priori probability mass function (PMF) pS(s) on S, we have the random variable (RV) S that represents secret input values. Furthermore, taking pS(s) and C, we can define the output RV O with a PMF given by pO(o) = \u2211 s pO(o|s)pS(s).\nDefinition 1 (Vulnerability). Suppose a potential eavesdropper A wishes to guess the value of S in one try and, in\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License. For more information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n4 the worst-case assumption, admit that A knows pS(s) and C; therefore, the a priori vulnerability is mathematically formulated as\nV (S) = max s\u2208S pS(s), (3)\nand the a posteriori vulnerability is given by V (S|O) = \u2211 o\u2208O pO(o)max s\u2208S pS(s|o)\n= \u2211 o\u2208O max s\u2208S (pO(o|s)pS(s)), (4)\nwith 0 < V (S) \u2264 V (S|O) \u2264 1.\nWe obtain the uncertainty measure by taking the negative logarithm of vulnerability V (\u00b7), i.e., R\u00e9nyi\u2019s min-entropy [20], [21]. Thus, we have the following definitions.\nDefinition 2 (Initial Uncertainty). The initial uncertainty is given by\nH\u221e(S) = \u2212 log2(V (S)). (5)\nDefinition 3 (Remaining Uncertainty). The remaining uncertainty is given by\nH\u221e(S|O) = \u2212 log2(V (S|O)). (6)\nDefinition 4 (Information Leakage). The information leakage is given by the difference between the initial uncertainty and the remaining uncertainty. In mathematical terms, we have\nI\u221e(S;O) = H\u221e(S)\u2212H\u221e(S|O) = log2 ( V (S|O) V (S) ) . (7)\nDefinition 4 reveals how vulnerable S is to one guess (in one try), given that the eavesdropper A knows O. On the other hand, one can assume multiple guesses for A; hence, I\u221e(S;O) might become inadequate [22]. Nevertheless, we can derive a mathematically tractable bound for at most gguesses made by A as a factor of g. Namely, we have Vg(S) \u2264 gV (S) and Vg(S|O) \u2264 gV (S|O), with Vg(S) being the vulnerability for g-guesses [22].\nAn optimal strategy is to guess the value of S according to a decreasing order of the probabilities of S\u2014Definition 1 assumes exactly the same if only one try is allowed. Let p1, p2, . . . , p|S| be the probabilities of S such that p1 \u2265 p2 \u2265 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2265 p|S|. Thus, the expected number of guesses required to guess S optimally, i.e., the guessing entropy of S, is given by\nG(S) = |S|\u2211 l=1 lpl. (8)\nMassey\u2019s guessing entropy bound in [23] establishes a lower bound on the expected number of guesses required to find S given O as a function of Shannon\u2019s conditional entropy H(S|O). It claims that the guessing entropy of S given O meets\nG(S|O) \u2265 2H(S|O)\u22122 + 1. (9)\nHowever, this expected number of guesses may be arbitrarily large even when H(S|O)\u2014and, accordingly, Massey\u2019s lower bound\u2014is arbitrarily small. Moreover, [20] indicates through examples that G(S) or G(S|O) can be high even when the\nattacker can guess S reasonably well in one try. A similar conclusion can be drawn by assuming that p1 and |S| are large enough in (8). In contrast, as the conditional min-entropy H\u221e(S|O) satisfies\nV (S|O) = 2\u2212H\u221e(S|O), (10)\nit provides immediate security guarantees about the vulnerability of S given O since both quantities, V (S|O) and H\u221e(S|O), are directly related."

It follows that the phase of the local oscillator of A after the handshake is given by\n\u03c1LO = \u03b8DM(\u03d5Bob, nR) + \u03b8nR(\u03d5E) + E[\u03b8Ch], (11)\nwith E[\u00b7] denoting the expectation operator. If the channel is additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), then we have E[\u03b8Ch] = 0. The phase shift of symbols received by A after the handshake (confidential data) is given by\n\u03c1S = \u03b8DM(\u03d5Bob, n) + \u03b8n(\u03d5E) + \u03b8Ch, (12)\nand the phase error in A can be written as\n\u03c1 = \u03c1S \u2212 \u03c1LO = \u03b8DM(\u03d5Bob, n) + \u03b8n(\u03d5E) + \u03b8Ch\n\u2212\u03b8DM(\u03d5Bob, nR)\u2212 \u03b8nR(\u03d5E)\u2212 E[\u03b8Ch]. (13)\nFinally, the complex received symbol is given by\nr = |m+ w| exp(i(\u03c1+ \u03b2)), (14)\nwhere m represents the complex transmitted symbol with the phase \u03b2, w is a complex Gaussian RV with zero mean and variance \u03c32, and i = \u221a \u22121.\nThe eavesdropperA must maximize the information leakage I\u221e(S;O), with S being the secret symbol whose complex representation is given by m, and O is the received symbol. Note that the mapping of S into m depends on the adopted modulation. The eavesdropper\u2019s demodulation function (or demodulation map) can be defined as d : C \u2192 O; thus, the received symbol can be written as o = d(r). Therefore, the task of the eavesdropper A is to choose a function d(\u00b7) that maximizes the chance of guessing S; this can be mathematically formulated as\nmax d(r) I\u221e(S;O) (15) s.t. |S| \u2264 |O| \u2264 |S|N,\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

In fact, the totality of symbols sent through the channel by the transmitter is less than or equal to |S|N ; therefore, a set of output symbols O\u2217 with |O\u2217| > |S|N has spare elements. |S| \u2264 |O| can be trivially understood, as the output set cannot be smaller than the input set without a loss of information in this particular context. As will become clear throughout the remainder of the paper, we commonly have |O| = |S|N .\nLemma 1. Assume that pR,S(r, s) is the joint probability density function (PDF) of the complex received symbol R and the secret input values S. Let Ps be a complex plane such that pR,S(r, s) > pR,S(r, s\n\u2217)\u2200 r \u2208 Ps and s \u0338= s\u2217. Then, V (S|O) is maximized if and only if d(r) maps all r \u2208 Ps for the same observable output value o.\nProof. Let the complex plane R be the sample space of R and assume that d(r) = o \u2200r \u2208 Ro such that Ro \u2282 R and Ro \u2229 Ri = \u2205 \u2200i \u0338= o. Given the characteristics of d(r), we can then write\npO(o|s) = \u222b Ro pR(r|s)dr,\nand\npO(o|s)pS(s) = \u222b Ro pR,S(r, s)dr.\nNow, let so be the value of s which maximizes a term of the following summation\u2211\no\u2208O max s\u2208S\n(pO(o|s)pS(s)).\nThus, we can write\nmax s\u2208S (\u222b Ro pR,S(r, s)dr ) =\n= \u222b Ro\u2229Pso pR,S(r, so)dr + \u222b Ro\u2212Pso pR,S(r, so)dr\n\u2264 \u2211 a\u2208S \u222b Ro\u2229Pa pR,S(r, a)dr = \u222b Ro max s\u2208S pR(r|s)pS(s)dr.\nIt follows that\u2211 o\u2208O max s\u2208S (pO(o|s)pS(s)) \u2264 \u222b R max s\u2208S pR(r|s)pS(s)dr (17)\nwith the equality condition being met only if Ro = Pso \u2200o \u2208 O.\nTheorem 1. Let Ps,n be a complex plane such that pR,S,n(r, s, n) > pR,S,n(r, s\n\u2217, n\u2217)\u2200 r \u2208 Ps,n and s \u0338= s\u2217 \u2228 n \u0338= n\u2217 with pR,S,n(r, s, n) being the joint PDF of the complex received symbol R, the secret input values S, and the transmitting antenna n. The eavesdropper A can maximize the system vulnerability by designing the demodulation function\ndA(r) in such a way that for all r \u2208 Ps,n, it is mapped to the same output o.\nProof. One can easily extend the proof of Lemma 1 by considering the secret input values with a combination of s and n as follows. Let the modulation function be c : S \u00d7{1, 2, . . . , N} \u2192 C. Then, we can define the transmitting symbol M as an RV given by m = c\u03d5(s, n) for the direction \u03d5. Furthermore, the sample space of M contains at most |S|N elements, and the PMF of M is given by pM (m) = pS(s)pn(n). Thus, we can apply Lemma 1 by considering M as the secret input.\nOne way to interpret Theorem 1 is as follows: the vulnerability maximization forA refers to finding the optimal decision areas (or boundaries) for a finite output alphabet. For a practical approach, the use of Theorem 1 solely requires knowledge of the joint PDF of the complex received symbol R, the secret input values S, and the transmitting antenna n. Hereafter, we will assume that the eavesdropper has precise knowledge about pR,S,n(r, s, n) in order to establish the worst-case scenario regarding vulnerability. Note that any mismatch between the prior pR,S,n(r, s, n) at A and the correct pR,S,n(r, s, n) can lead to information leakage less than or equal to that obtained with perfect prior knowledge of pR,S,n(r, s, n).\nOne can note that dA(\u00b7) is always a noninjective surjective function. Furthermore, for a sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), we have a bijective function from S and n to O; therefore, the information leakage would be maximum given that A would be able to recover precisely S."

In this subsection, we assess how the arrangement of transmitting antennas impacts the vulnerability of the system. Assuming the worst-case scenario (from a security viewpoint) where the eavesdropper is in its optimal operation, we provide some guidelines on the design of an antenna array that minimizes the information leakage.\nLemma 2. For the eavesdropper A that uses the demodulation function dA(r) according to Theorem 1, the vulnerability of the system is then given by\nV (S|O) = N \u2212 \u2211 o\u2208O \u03f5o,so , (18)\nwhere \u03f5o,s = Pr[dA(r) \u0338= o \u2229 S = s] is the error probability and so = argmaxs\u2208S pO(o|s)pS(s).\nProof.

Because pR(r|so, n) is a 2\u03c32 variance, complex Gaussian whose center is at cA(so, n), one can notice that lim\u03c3\u21920 V (S|O) = 1 and lim\u03c3\u21920 I\u221e(S;O) = H\u221e(S). In other words, the information leakage of the system tends to its maximum value insofar as the SNR increases.\nTheorem 2. For equiprobable secret symbols and a uniformly distributed phase \u03b8An (i.e., the antenna array in conjunction with the Random Integer Generator produces a uniform phase shift), the information leakage to an eavesdropper in the direction \u03d5 \u0338= \u03d5Bob is given by\nI\u221e(S;O) = log2\n( L\u2211\nl=1\nQ1 (ml \u03c3 , rl\u22121 \u03c3 , rl \u03c3 )) , (22)\nwith the set of nonrepeating elements in an ascending order {m1,m2, . . . ,mL} being the modules of complex symbols m, {r1, r2, . . . , rL\u22121|r1 < r2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < rL\u22121} are the radii of the circular decision regions of the output symbols O, r0 = 0, rL = \u221e, Qm(a, b) =\u222b\u221e b 1 2x ( exp ( \u2212 ( a2 + x2 ))) ( x a )m\u22121 Im\u22121(ax) dx is the Marcum Q-function [24], and Qm(a, b0, b1) = Qm (a, b0)\u2212Qm (a, b1).\nProof. Let \u03b8An[k] be the kth sample of \u03b8n(\u03d5) over time and assume that \u03b8An[k] \u2200k \u2208 {1, 2, . . . } has a circular uniform distribution in the interval [\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0), i.e., p\u03b8An(\u03b8An) = 1/(2\u03c0). Because the phase error in the direction \u03d5 is given by \u03c1 = \u03b8DM(\u03d5Bob, n)+ \u03b8n(\u03d5)+ \u03b8Ch\u2212\u03c1LO with \u2212\u03c0 \u2264 \u03c1 < \u03c0, the PDF of \u03c1 can be obtained as\np\u03c1(\u03c1) = \u2211 \u03b8DM \u222b \u03c0 \u2212\u03c0 p\u03c1(\u03c1|\u03b8DM, \u03b8Ch)p\u03b8DM(\u03b8DM)p\u03b8Ch(\u03b8Ch)d\u03b8Ch\n= \u2211 \u03b8DM \u222b \u03c0 \u2212\u03c0 1 2\u03c0 p\u03b8DM(\u03b8DM)p\u03b8Ch(\u03b8Ch)d\u03b8Ch = 1\n2\u03c0 . (23)\nNote that p\u03c1(\u03c1|\u03b8DM, \u03b8Ch) has a distribution identical to that of \u03b8n, but with the mean shifted due to the addition of \u03b8DM(\u03d5Bob, n), \u03b8Ch, and \u03c1LO.\nFrom Lemma 1, we have the boundaries of the optimal decision regions as circles. Let the radii of the decision regions be given by {r1, r2, . . . , rL\u22121|r1 < r2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < rL\u22121}, we have that\npO(o = ol|s) = \u222b rl rl\u22121 |r| \u03c32 exp ( \u2212m2l \u2212 |r|2 2\u03c32 ) I0 ( ml|r| \u03c32 ) dr\n= Q1 (m \u03c3 , rl\u22121 \u03c3 , rl \u03c3 ) ,\nwith r0 = 0, rL =\u221e, and l = {1, 2, . . . , L\u2212 1}. Then, the vulnerability expression can be written as\nV (S|O) = 1 |S| L\u2211 l=1 Q1 (ml \u03c3 , rl\u22121 \u03c3 , rl \u03c3 ) .\nFinally, the information leakage is given by\nI\u221e(S;O) = log2\n( L\u2211\nl=1\nQ1 (ml \u03c3 , rl\u22121 \u03c3 , rl \u03c3 )) .\nCorollary 1. For equiprobable secret symbols and uniformly distributed phase \u03b8An = \u03b8DM(\u03d5Bob, n)+\u03b8n(\u03d5), the information leakage in the direction \u03d5 \u0338= \u03d5Bob is null in phase shift key modulation.\nProof. For the phase-shift keying modulation, we have L = 1 in Theorem 2. Therefore, the mutual information simplifies to\nI\u221e(S;O) = log2 ( Q1 (m1 \u03c3 , 0,\u221e )) = log2(1) = 0.\nAmong other ways, we can understand Corollary 1 as an optimal limit for the communication security of the proposed system. Corollary 1 establishes the possibility of secure communication between the transmitter and the legitimate receiver. In other words, from the viewpoint of information leakage, Corollary 1 points to the condition that the proposed system becomes impossible to decipher. Note that an eavesdropper or a legitimate receiver in the direction \u03d5Bob would be able to intercept the message, even though \u03b8An follows a uniform distribution."

In addition, we assume that the legitimate receiver is in the direction of \u03d5 = \u03c0, i.e., \u03d5Bob = \u03c0, quadrature phaseshift keying (QPSK) modulation, \u03c0D/\u03bb = 1, and n are equiprobable for all the following cases.\nFor Case I and Case II, we adopted two distinct demodulation processes for the eavesdropper as follows: the eavesdropper Aopt adopts the demodulation function dA(r) according to Theorem 1, and the eavesdropper A has the demodulation function dA(r) like a traditional QPSK. In this way, we call BERopt the bit error rate of Aopt and BERQPSK the bit error rate of A.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

            "text": "Fig. 2 depicts two constellations on the receiver. One is in the direction \u03d5 = 60\u00b0, see the blue circles, and the other is in the direction \u03d5 = 120\u00b0, see the red \u00d7\u2019s. We present constellations with different energy configurations for the sake of better visibility. The ordered pair next to the symbols consists of the transmitted secret symbol S and the transmitting antenna n as (Sn) with S \u2208 {0, 1, 2, 3} and n \u2208 {1, 2}. For example, the ordered pair denoted by 12 means that the secret symbol S is 1, and the transmitting antenna n is 2. These two constellations were chosen because they represent extreme cases. In both constellations, the modulation process produces symbols m = c\u03d5(s, n) identical for different values of n. However, the symbols m that are superimposed for \u03d5 = 60\u00b0 represent distinct secret symbols S while overlapping symbols m for \u03d5 = 120\u00b0 represent the same secret symbol S. For instance, we have c60\u00b0(3, 2) = c60\u00b0(1, 1) and c120\u00b0(1, 2) = c120\u00b0(1, 1); therefore, it is impossible to decide whether the transmitted symbol is s = 3 or s = 1 for the direction \u03d5 = 60\u00b0 if it receives c60\u00b0(3, 2), whereas an eavesdropper in the direction \u03d5 = 120\u00b0 can properly recover S. This distinction can be explained as follows. An eavesdropper in the direction \u03d5 = 120\u00b0 obtains two bits of information whenever it correctly estimates m, whereas another eavesdropper in the direction \u03d5 = 60\u00b0 only gets one bit of information on average\u2014the uncertainty about S is reduced by 1 bit (to two possibilities) for the direction \u03d5 = 60\u00b0 given the reception of m.\nLet us now introduce the AWGN such that the SNR equals 10 dB. This scenario is depicted in Fig. 3. We focus on the constellations as previously discussed: \u03d5 = 60\u00b0 and \u03d5 = 120\u00b0. As aforementioned, there is an information leakage of approximately 2 bits and 1 bit in the directions \u03d5 = 120\u00b0 and \u03d5 = 60\u00b0, respectively. However, information leakage cannot be assessed directly through the BERQPSK. In other words, the BERQPSK can somewhat conceal the potential vulnerability of the system.

BER and information leakage I\u221e(S;O) versus the direction \u03d5 for case N = 2.\n\u03d5 = 120\u00b0 is high, the BERQPSK for the case \u03d5 = 120\u00b0 is also high. This counterintuitive effect can be explained as follows: the information leakage is calculated assuming that the eavesdropper applies Theorem 1, while the BERQPSK calculation cannot incorporate the peculiar characteristics of the system. On the other hand, the BERopt for \u03d5 = 120\u00b0 is low by meeting Theorem 1, i.e., extracting the maximum information from the signal.\nFig. 3 also reveals the sensitivity (in the context of vulnerability) of the system concerning several directions. As a result, we notice the maximum information leakage for a vast set of \u03d5. At best, the system provides information leakage of around 1 bit. In general terms, we can say that the system with three antennas is vulnerable to attacks. Furthermore, the BERopt has values lower than the BERQPSK, corroborating Theorem 1. Next, we consider larger N cases for the sake of completeness."

For example, the ordered pairs 11, 33, 22, and 04 constitute one set. For any of the four sets, it can become almost infeasible, in the presence of noise, to distinguish between the four symbols belonging to a set. Furthermore, each of the four symbols of a set comes from a different S. This characteristic of the constellation transfers little or almost no information to the receiver about the secret input S when operating under noise. Therefore, it is to be expected that it will lead to greater security for communication.\nIn order to verify the efficiency of the constellation shown in Fig. 4, we assume that the system is subject to an SNR of 10 dB. Fig. 5 depicts BERQPSK, BERopt, and information leakage for this case. Note that the information leakage is low for \u03d5 = 10\u00b0. Again, the BERQPSK does not satisfactorily measure the behavior of the system regarding its vulnerability. As can be seen in the figure, there is no symmetry between the BERQPSK and information leakage. There is a significant reduction in the number of spikes in information leakage as N increases from 2 to 4. In addition, we obtain values below 1 for the information leakage with four antennas. The system is still somewhat vulnerable, as the information leakage is mostly above 1 bit, with a significant proportion above 1.5 bits. Lastly, we have an improvement (a decrease in BER) in the performance of the optimized eavesdropper Aopt compared with A, corroborating Theorem 1. The following scenario discusses the case with a higher number of antennas."

It is evident that an increase in the value of N yields a decrease in the information leakage in certain directions of \u03d5. On the other hand, no significant change in BER can be observed with respect to a variation in the number of antennas. Note that although there is a substantial increase in the number of antennas from N = 34 to N = 299, we do not obtain a significant improvement with respect to the vulnerability of the system.\nFig. 7 depicts the mean of I\u221e(S;O) and BER concerning \u03d5 for N ranging from 10 to 300. On the one hand, the system vulnerability improves dramatically with the increase in the number of antennas for 10 < N < 50, i.e., I\u221e(S;O) has a descending behavior. On the other hand, there is no significant improvement in the system vulnerability for N > 50. Also, in Fig. 7, it can be observed that the BER does not vary as N increases, thus, making it impossible to understand how the system vulnerability behaves as the number of antennas increases.

Note that the leakage information reaches the maximum, and the BER tends to 1 in the direction \u03d5 = 260\u00b0 for SNR = 15 dB. Such an effect can be understood as follows. For QPSK modulation and Gray mapping under high SNR, one can obtain BER = 1 by shifting the constellation so that the phase error in A for \u03d5 = 260\u00b0 is 135\u00b0 < \u03c1 < 225\u00b0 \u2200n \u2208 {1, . . . , 6}. However, the information leakage is not affected; the system leaks two bits of information. This case study highlights the interdependence between noise and the vulnerability of dynamic directional modulation (DDM).\nGiven the four previous cases, we propose the following statement.\nConjecture 1. The closer the values of cA(s, n)\u2200s \u2208 S for the same n are, the less vulnerable the wireless system becomes.\nConjecture 1 can be explained, among other ways, as follows. The vulnerability of a system depends on the format of the constellation generated by the DDM. In addition, constellations that coalesce symbols from the same secret input S are more vulnerable. Therefore, two design guidelines can be established: (i) given an antenna array, security can be increased in a specific direction by selecting for transmission only those antennas that meet Conjecture 1; and (ii) the antenna array design should be based on Conjecture 1."

Sufficient conditions for a null information leakage in the direction \u03d5 \u0338= \u03d5Bob are presented in Corollary 1. Although the proposed work provides some useful insights, it assumes an ideal eavesdropping model where the eavesdropper has perfect knowledge of the channel statistics, which is impractical in realistic models. Thus, one could investigate the impact of imperfect channel estimation on the eavesdropper performance as a possible future extension of the work presented here."
