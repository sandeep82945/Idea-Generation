In this study, we aimed to determine the rate of emergency and planned physical health hospitalisations in those with SMI, compared to matched comparators, and to investigate how these rates differ by SMI diagnosis. Methods.We used Clinical Practice Research DataLink Gold and Aurum databases to identify 20,668 patients in England diagnosed with SMI between January 2000 and March 2016, with linked hospital records in Hospital Episode Statistics. Patients were matched with up to four patients without SMI. Primary outcomes were emergency and planned physical health admissions. Avoidable (ambulatory care sensitive) admissions and emergency admissions for accidents, injuries and substance misuse were secondary outcomes. We performed negative binomial regression, adjusted for clinical and demographic variables, stratified by SMI diagnosis. Results. Emergency physical health (aIRR:2.33; 95% CI 2.22\u20132.46) and avoidable (aIRR:2.88; 95% CI 2.60\u20133.19) admissions were higher in patients with SMI than comparators. Emergency admission rates did not differ by SMI diagnosis. Planned physical health admissions were lower in schizophrenia (aIRR:0.80; 95% CI 0.72\u20130.90) and higher in bipolar disorder (aIRR:1.33; 95% CI 1.24\u20131.43). Accident, injury and substance misuse emergency admissions were particularly high in the year after SMI diagnosis (aIRR: 6.18; 95% CI 5.46\u20136.98). Conclusion. We found twice the incidence of emergency physical health admissions in patients with SMI compared to those without SMI. Avoidable admissions were particularly elevated, suggesting interventions in community settings could reduce hospitalisations. Importantly, we found underutilisation of planned inpatient care in patients with schizophrenia. Interventions are required to ensure appropriate healthcare use, and optimal diagnosis and treatment of physical health conditions in people with SMI, to reduce the mortality gap due to physical illness.",

Accident, injury and substance misuse emergency admissions were particularly high in the year after SMI diagnosis (aIRR: 6.18; 95% CI 5.46\u20136.98). Conclusion. We found twice the incidence of emergency physical health admissions in patients with SMI compared to those without SMI. Avoidable admissions were particularly elevated, suggesting interventions in community settings could reduce hospitalisations. Importantly, we found underutilisation of planned inpatient care in patients with schizophrenia. Interventions are required to ensure appropriate healthcare use, and optimal diagnosis and treatment of physical health conditions in people with SMI, to reduce the mortality gap due to physical illness.\nIntroduction\nPeople with severe mental illness (SMI) have poorer physical health (Launders, Hayes, Price, & Osborn, 2022), a higher rate of non-mental health hospitalisations (Germack, Caron, Solomon, & Hanrahan, 2018; Jansen, van Schijndel, van Waarde, & van Busschbach, 2018), and a higher risk of mortality than the general population (Hayes, Marston, Walters, King, & Osborn, 2017; Walker, McGee, & Druss, 2015). A recent meta-analysis found elevated rates of non-mental health admissions in people with SMI, even when controlling for underlying physical health (Ronaldson et al., 2020), suggesting that increased prevalence of physical health conditions is not the only driver of elevated non-mental health admissions in those with SMI.\nBarriers to timely preventative care and to services aimed at the management of chronic disease, may lead to increased emergency admissions. Barriers to appropriate physical health care for those with SMI include healthcare-related factors such as diagnostic overshadowing resulting in delayed diagnosis of physical health conditions, and fragmented healthcare systems hampering a patient\u2019s ability to access appropriate and timely care, as well as patient-level factors such as cognitive impairment, reduced motivation or social isolation reducing healthcare access. There is also evidence that patients with SMI are at increased risk of 30-day readmissions for physical health conditions (Germack et al., 2018; Jansen et al., 2018), suggesting treatment failure and suboptimal follow-up care and management may be responsible for\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291722002811 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nsome of the increased emergency hospital use in this population. Understanding the use of planned and emergency hospitalisation is therefore important to implement appropriate actions, aimed at providing accessible physical health services, reducing emergency admissions with the aim of reducing premature mortality in people living with SMI.\nA subset of emergency admissions is thought to be avoidable if appropriate disease management services are in place (Purdy, Griffin, Salisbury, & Sharp, 2009). In the general population, analyses of these admissions have been used to identify subsets of patients for whom interventions in primary care may impact their emergency hospital use (Orlowski et al., 2021). In the context of people with SMI, previous studies have found elevated rates of avoidable admissions (Davydow et al., 2016; Lin, Huang, Chen, & Chen, 2011), but few if any have put this in the context of emergency admissions for other causes.\nWhile there is evidence that non-mental health admissions are elevated in those with SMI, there is a need to investigate the contribution of physical health admissions separately from accident and injury admissions, and avoidable admissions in comparison to emergency admissions for other causes. Furthermore, there is a paucity of evidence on the impact of having SMI on planned v. emergency physical health admissions. The objective of this cohort study was to determine the rate of emergency and planned physical health hospitalisations in those with SMI, compared to matched comparators, and to investigate how these rates differ by SMI diagnosis."

At the time of this study, these databases held deidentified primary care medical records for over 39 million patients in the UK. We defined patients with a diagnosis of SMI using medical codes for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or other non-affective psychotic illnesses (online Supplementary Table S1). Patients with SMI were matched to individuals who had never had a diagnosis of SMI on sex, five-year age band, primary care practice and year of primary care practice registration to comparators. Exact matching was performed by CPRD prior to receipt of the dataset and comparators were matched at least 1:1 and up to 1:4 based on the availability of comparators. Hospitalisation data were available from 1 April 2000 to 31 March 2017, we therefore included patients with a first diagnosis of SMI between 1 April 2000 and 31 March 2016 to allow for at least one year\u2019s follow up. The index date was the date of diagnosis, or for comparators, the date that their matched patient with SMI was diagnosed. We excluded patients under the age of 18 or over 100 with less than one year of active follow up at index. Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Independent Scientific Advisory Committee of CPRD (protocol no. 18_288)."

We also linked data from the Office for National Statistics to obtain the 2015 Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) (Office for National Statistics, 2015). The 2015 IMD provides a relative measure of deprivation across small areas in England as calculated in 2015. The IMD quintile was then determined for patients in CPRD based on patient postcode.

We defined admissions as spells of continuous hospitalisation in a single hospital. We excluded hospital spells where a patient was transferred from another hospital (1.8% of admissions) or where the source of admission was not given (0.1%). The reason for admission was identified based on ICD-10 codes for the primary diagnosis of the first episode of care within a spell.

We defined age as age at index based on year of birth as a continuous variable. Sex and ethnicity were reported as recorded in the patient\u2019s primary care medical records. Ethnicity was grouped based on the UK 2011 Census Ethnic Group categories (Office for National Statistics, 2014): \u2018Asian\u2019, \u2018Black\u2019, \u2018Mixed\u2019, \u2018White\u2019 or \u2018Other\u2019. Where multiple ethnicities existed for an individual, we selected the most frequent, and where frequencies were equal, the most recent ever recorded. Region was based on primary care practice postcode, and IMD was based on patient postcode and, where this was missing, the primary care practice postcode.\nWe also investigated physical health, substance misuse, smoking and obesity as potential confounders. Underlying physical health conditions and multimorbidity are key drivers of\n5604 Naomi Launders et al.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291722002811 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nadmissions, while substance misuse, obesity and smoking may increase the severity or result in poor self-management of physical health conditions and may be precursors to physical disease. We included a count of 24 physical health conditions, defined from code lists for the Elixhauser and Charlson Comorbidity Index (Launders et al., 2022; Metcalfe et al., 2019). For investigation of avoidable admissions, angina was also included, defined using the Caliber code list (https://www.caliberresearch.org/portal/codelists). We defined alcohol and drug misuse using the code lists for the Elixhauser comorbidity index (Metcalfe et al., 2019). We categorised smoking status as never-smoker, ex-smoker, or current smoker using medical code lists, taking the most recent category prior to index, and recording any neversmokers with a historical code for smoking as ex-smokers. We took the most recent BMI prior to index, categorised as obese (BMI\u2a7e 30), overweight (BMI 25 to 29.9), healthy weight (BMI 18.5 to 24.9) or underweight (BMI < 18.5), derived from the recording of obesity, BMI, and BMI calculated from weight and height recording."

We coded ethnicity as White ethnic group where this variable was missing. This approach is in line with previous research using primary care data, which suggests that more than 93% of individuals without ethnicity recorded are from a white ethnic group (HippisleyCox et al., 2008). Furthermore, sensitivity analyses comparing physical health outcomes using this method found similar effect estimates as using multiple imputations (Launders et al., 2022)."

We investigated the effect of covariates updated at one-year post-diagnosis, to account for potential increased capture of physical health conditions around the time of SMI diagnosis. We limited the population to those with at least one year of registration prior to the start date, to investigate the impact of possible incomplete baseline data, and reran the main analysis with individual physical health conditions rather than a count to investigate the potential of residual confounding. Finally, we ran the models to account for the use of primary (online Supplementary Table S4), and secondary (planned and emergency non-mental health admissions) care use in the year prior to the start date. A final post-hoc sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the impact of using a zero-inflated negative binomial model for the primary outcomes."

Patients with schizophrenia had fewer planned admissions compared to comparators (aIRR: 0.80; 95% CI 0.72\u2013 0.90), while those with bipolar disorder had more (aIRR: 1.33; 95% CI 1.24\u20131.43; Table 2 & Fig. 2). As with the emergency physical health admissions, controlling for health risk factors (BMI, smoking, alcohol, and drug misuse) and underlying physical health conditions did not alter the findings, and controlling for physical health decreased the aIRR for patients with bipolar disorder and other psychoses; but increased the aIRR for patients with schizophrenia.\nThe E value for the fully adjusted IRR of planned physical admissions in people with schizophrenia compared to those without SMI was 1.85, suggesting an unmeasured confounder would need an effect size of 1.85 in relation to both schizophrenia and\nhospitalisation to confound this finding.

When pooled across diagnoses, patients with SMI had a higher incidence of emergency avoidable admissions than those without SMI (aIRR: 2.88; 95% CI 2.60\u20133.19). This remained, even after controlling for prior diagnosis of individual physical health conditions included in the ACSC definition and a count of other physical health conditions (aIRR: 2.39; 95% CI 2.17\u20132.64); and was higher than for emergency physical health admissions not defined as avoidable (Table 2). When stratified by type of avoidable admission, the aIRR was highest for admissions due to chronic physical health conditions (aIRR: 3.46; 95% CI 2.97\u20134.02; Table 2).\nRates of emergency accident, injury and substance misuse admissions were lower than emergency physical health admissions (Fig. 1), however patients with an SMI had markedly elevated rates of emergency accident, injury and substance misuse admissions compared to the non-SMI comparator population (aIRR: 4.84; 95% CI 4.48\u20135.22).\n5610 Naomi Launders et al.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291722002811 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nThe E value for the fully adjusted IRR of emergency avoidable admissions in those with v. without SMI was 4.21, and for admissions for accidents, injuries and substance misuse admissions was 7.60"

            "text": "Physical health admissions in NHS secondary care were the most frequent non-mental health reason for hospital admissions for those with and without SMI. People with SMI were over twice as likely to have an emergency physical health admission during the study period than those without SMI, and the rate of admissions was similar across SMI diagnoses. This remained true after controlling for a wide range of demographic and clinical factors.\nEmergency admissions due to chronic avoidable conditions were almost three and a half times the admission rate in patients with SMI compared to those without SMI. Given the high prevalence of diabetes, COPD and neurological disease in people with SMI (Launders et al., 2022), this represents a major burden on the NHS. Controlling for pre-existing physical health conditions did not alter our findings, suggesting that the number of underlying physical health conditions that a patient has recorded in primary care is not the only driver of the high rate of physical health admissions in people with SMI. In contrast, the high rate of avoidable admissions for chronic conditions suggests that severity or control of pre-existing physical health conditions leads to high emergency admissions for physical health. As these conditions are thought to be preventable or can be reduced by actions in primary care or community settings, this suggests that targeted approaches to improving physical health screening, and the monitoring and treatment of chronic physical health conditions in community settings are needed to reduce emergency hospital admissions in this population. While physical health checks are incentivised in primary care in the UK, a previous study found that while care plans reduced avoidable admissions in those with SMI, physical health checks for BMI, blood pressure,\ncholesterol and glucose did not (Ride et al., 2018). A range of interventions are therefore likely required to reduce avoidable admissions in those with SMI, such as physical health clinics in psychiatric services, more thorough physical health checks and screening, improved uptake of care plans, and personalised care and support to better manage existing physical health conditions.\nFurthermore, people with SMI also have a high prevalence of modifiable health risk factors (Launders et al., 2022), which may increase the severity or affect the management of physical health conditions. Interventions aimed at reducing these, such as smoking or alcohol cessation services have been shown to be effective (Gilbody et al., 2019; McDonell et al., 2017), and may also act to reduce emergency admissions.\nThe year following SMI diagnosis appears to be a time of high emergency hospital admissions utilisation in people with SMI. We found that people with SMI were over five times as likely to be admitted for accidents, injuries and substance misuse, and almost three times as likely to have an avoidable admission in the year following SMI diagnosis. This suggests that targeted interventions around the time of diagnosis are required, particularly focusing on risk reduction and management of existing physical health conditions.\nExcess emergency admissions reduce the quality and length of life for those with SMI and represent a cost burden to the NHS. Using a prevalence of SMI in 2015/2016 of 0.89% (Grigoroglou et al., 2020), and a population of 43.8 million people aged 18 or over in 2017 in England; this suggests an excess of between 35 000 to 45 000 admissions per year, likely to cost in excess of \u00a355 million (using an average emergency admission cost of \u00a31603 in 2017/2018) (NHS Improvement, 2019).\nIn contrast to the findings of all emergency admission outcomes, there were marked differences by SMI diagnosis for planned physical health admissions, and we found that pooling results for all SMI diagnoses potentially masks differences in planned healthcare utilisation. People with bipolar disorder had elevated rates of planned physical health admissions, while those with schizophrenia had far lower rates. While low rates of emergency inpatient admissions are usually deemed to be a sign of good preventative and primary care, the lower-than-expected rates of planned admissions for physical health in people with schizophrenia are of concern, and suggest potential barriers to access of planned inpatient care in this population. However, while there has been research into barriers to attending screening and other disease-specific specialist services (Bramberg, Torgerson, Kjellstrom, Welin, & Rusner, 2018; Melamed et al., 2019; Murphy et al., 2021), as well as primary care (Bramberg et al., 2018; Decoux, 2005; Kohn et al., 2021; Mitchell et al., 2022), there is less information on barriers to planned inpatient admissions. We need to understand the reasons for reduced rates of planned care specifically in people with schizophrenia as this may contribute to the mortality gap for this group of patients."

            "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate both planned and emergency admissions in people with SMI, and the first longitudinal study based in England investigating admissions in people with SMI compared to matched comparators. While previous studies have found high rates of potentially avoidable admissions in those with SMI (Davydow et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2011; Mai, Holman, Sanfilippo, & Emery, 2011), the size of this cohort allows for stratification by SMI diagnosis and investigation of causes other\nPsychological Medicine 5611\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291722002811 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nthan avoidable ACSC admissions, furthering the understanding of the differences in hospital utilisation in people with SMI.\nThe use of linked primary and secondary care records is a major strength of our study. Many studies of hospital admissions use only hospital data and are therefore limited to patients who attend hospital during a baseline period. The longitudinal nature of primary care records in England, and richness of data they contain, allows for a more complete capture of demographic and clinical data and a more accurate comparison of hospital admission rates between those with and without SMI in the general population.\nWe were able to control for known causes of variation in hospital admissions at the patient level, such as age, sex, ethnicity and deprivation (Busby, Purdy, & Hollingworth, 2017a). Patients with SMI were matched with comparators in the same primary care practice, reducing the known variation in hospital admission rates between practices, and regionally in England (Busby et al., 2017b). Controlling for pre-existing physical health conditions did not alter our findings, suggesting that the number of underlying physical health conditions that a patient has recorded in primary care is not the only driver of the high rate of physical health admissions in people with SMI. This is supported by a previous study of avoidable ACSC conditions in those with SMI (Davydow et al., 2016). For those with schizophrenia, controlling for pre-existing physical health conditions did not reduce the IRR of any of the hospital outcomes, possibly due to an underascertainment of physical disease in this population (Gabilondo, Alonso-Moran, Nuno-Solinis, Orueta, & Iruin, 2017; Launders et al., 2022; Smith, Langan, McLean, Guthrie, & Mercer, 2013).\nWhile we controlled for physical health conditions, we did not control for other mental health diagnoses. It is recognised that physical health admissions are elevated in people with anxiety and depression (Guthrie et al., 2016) and high rates of these diagnoses in those with SMI may therefore contribute to high admissions. However, whether depression and anxiety is a symptom of SMI or a separate condition may not be clear (Upthegrove, Marwaha, & Birchwood, 2017), and therefore the role of other mental health diagnoses on hospitalisations in this population is hard to determine.\u201d\nWhile we were able to control for a range of covariates, the matching strategy of this cohort could have introduced bias. People with SMI were matched to those who did not develop SMI at any time prior to or during follow up. Given those with SMI are known to use more healthcare resources in the years prior to SMI diagnosis (Wallace et al., 2020), this could have resulted in the under-estimation of hospital utilisation in the comparator population. However, given that the incidence of SMI is low (Hardoon et al., 2013) the probability of matching a person with SMI to a person who will develop SMI in the future is also low, and therefore the impact is probably limited.\nIn the general population, hospital use in the year prior to outcome period may be the strongest predictor of hospital admissions (Donnan, Dorward, Mutch, & Morris, 2008; HippisleyCox & Coupland, 2013), and therefore useful for predicting which individuals will use hospital services. However, in models comparing admissions between groups it may represent overadjustment, since the same causal factors driving admissions may be present prior to and after index date, particularly in the year prior to SMI diagnosis, where healthcare use may be elevated (Wallace et al., 2020). In our study, including these variables attenuated all effect sizes but did not alter the main findings.\nWhile CPRD is broadly representative of England\u2019s population (Herrett et al., 2015; Wolf et al., 2019), there may be residual\nconfounding due to missing data or linkage bias. In particular, the capture of physical health diagnoses in primary care may be subject to surveillance bias, whereby those who attend primary care more often have more opportunities to have physical health conditions diagnosed and recorded.\nFinally, we did not investigate the length of stay in this study. Previous research has found that people with SMI have longer non-mental health hospital stays than those without SMI (Ronaldson et al., 2020) and higher hospital costs for avoidable admissions (Sporinova et al., 2019). These periods of admission and stays in inpatient psychiatric care represent periods of time where the patient is unable to experience admissions and could therefore have lowered the admission rate in those with SMI.\nWhile the average length of stay is elevated, those with SMI may also be at increased risk of discharge against medical advice. While we could find no studies investigating discharge disposition for physical health admissions in people with SMI, this could result in a greater risk of multiple short admissions, and drive some of the high 30-readmission rates observed in this population (Germack et al., 2018; Ronaldson et al., 2020). The likely complex pattern of the length of stays for physical health admissions, reasons for discharge, and the impact this has on hospital utilisation in those with SMI requires further research."

We also identified an under-utilisation of planned physical health hospital services in those with schizophrenia. Further research is required to determine the drivers of high-frequency admissions in those with underlying physical disease, and potential barriers to optimal use of healthcare services in this population. To reduce physical health admissions in people with SMI, targeted interventions are required in community and psychiatric services, aimed at improving access to appropriate care, ensuring effective physical health screening, and providing support to enable appropriate treatment and control of chronic physical health conditions.\nSupplementary material.
