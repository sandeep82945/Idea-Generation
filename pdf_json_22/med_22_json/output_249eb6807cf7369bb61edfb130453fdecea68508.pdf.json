    "abstractText": "This study aims to improve the operational safety of reinforced concrete-ribbed beam bridge decks and prolong their service life by performing fatigue analysis of deck slabs reinforced with carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers (CFRP) and other materials. Based on a 16-m-span ribbed girder bridge, five test beams were designed: three reinforced (with CFRP cloth, CFRP mesh, and strip steel plates) and the remaining unreinforced. To simulate the real force of the bridge deck slabs, a PLS-500 electro-hydraulic servo dynamic and static test system was used and static load failure (monotonic graded loading) and fixed-point constant-amplitude fatigue loading tests (fatigue load of 0.515, loading frequency of 5 Hz) were performed. The main fatigue crack appeared when the number of load cycles exceeded 90% of the fatigue life. In the middle of fatigue, the reinforcement material can reduce the deterioration value of the bridge deck by approximately 50%. When it is reinforced at the cumulative damage degree of 0.4, its fatigue life extends by approximately 53.3\u201378.9%. The fatigue life of the bridge deck slabs reinforced with CFRP cloth or mesh was 22.1\u201325.6% more than that of those reinforced with strip steel plates. CFRP cloth is best suited for the reinforcement of bridge",

            "text": "Reinforced concrete ribbed girder bridge deck slabs are subjected to material deterioration and fatigue under the repeated activity of large vehicles. The load and fatigue resistance of the bridge deck slabs gradually decrease. To resolve the low performance problems caused by material deterioration and fatigue of reinforced concrete ribbed girder bridge deck slabs, reasonable and effective strengthening of bridge deck slabs has gradually attracted the attention of scientists and technicians. Rahman et al. [1] selected a CFRP grid for the reinforcement of bridge deck slabs and carried out fatigue performance tests in the laboratory. Kongguo et al. [2] selected CFRP sheets for strengthening the deck slab of a solid bridge and analyzed the strengthening effect. Christina et al. [3] carried out comparative tests by selecting different types of mounted bars for bridge deck slabs. Yi et al. [4] analyzed the maintenance and reinforcement technology of a highway bridge deck and reinforcement layer. Li [5] selected FRP for reinforcing reinforced concrete one-way slabs and carried out bending tests. Biliang [6] selected CFRP for strengthening the bridge deck slab and carried out ductility tests. Chanhao [7] selected CFRP sheets for the reinforcement of bridge deck slabs and evaluated the fatigue resistance. Fang [8] selected BFRP grids for strengthening the bridge deck slab and carried out bending tests, while Yu et al. [9] selected FRP bars reinforcement for bridge deck slabs and carried out bending tests. Damaged concrete bridge deck slabs can be reinforced with various materials used for damage patching, primarily steel plates and composite fiber-reinforced materials [10,11]. The reinforcement methods are mainly divided into three: external bonded reinforcement, external prestressing reinforcement, and near-surface mounted reinforcement. The external\nPolymers 2022, 14, 3814. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym14183814 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2022, 14, 3814 2 of 21\nprestressing reinforcement involves using CFRP bars [12] or steel bars [13] for achieving reinforcement outside the structure. This method is difficult to implement and is limited by the space between the bridge deck slabs. The near-surface mounted reinforcement involves embedding the reinforcement materials into the original structure for reinforcement [14]. This method damages the original structure when implemented. The comparison shows that the external bonded reinforcement is the most ideal. The application of steel plates in a concrete bridge deck slab reinforcement is somewhat limited because they are prone to corrosion and have poor durability [15\u201317]. In contrast, composite fiber-reinforced materials are corrosion-resistant, have high specific strength, and are fatigue-resistant. Currently, many scholars are conducting research on external carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers (CFRP) reinforcement technology. Mhanna et al. [18] conducted an experimental study on the shear load capacity of reinforced concrete beams strengthened with CFRP laminates. Al-Saawani et al. [19] conducted an experimental study on FRP U-wrap anchorage. AlHuthaifi et al. [20] conducted an experimental study on reinforced concrete beams with longitudinal circular holes, using the CFRP strips strengthening method. Toutanji et al. [21] conducted a fatigue test study on concrete beams reinforced with CFRP. Al-Ghrery et al. [22] explored the effect of surface concavity of concrete structures on the performance of adhered CFRP reinforcement. Li [23], Yang [24], and Yang [25] collated, summarized, and analyzed the reinforcement technology of FRP in concrete structures. Zhou [26] concluded from an experimental study that the damage modes of CFRP-strengthened reinforced concrete beams under fatigue loading are mainly fatigue crushing of concrete in the compression zone, fatigue fracture of steel, and fatigue peeling at the interface. Research on U-shaped jacket [27], anchorage [28], and near-surface mounted reinforcement techniques [29] has advanced and developed to address the fatigue peeling damage of CFRP. In addition, CFRP is used for non-conventional reinforcement, such as the use of CFRP ropes for reinforcing RC joints under seismic loading [30]. CFRP reinforcement in concrete structures has been tried in various ways and the technology has matured. Jinping [31] repaired and strengthened the deck slab of an existing bridge by increasing the deck slab thickness and the amount of reinforcing steel, which improved the bearing capacity of the deck slab. This reinforcement method increases the self-weight of the structure, but its cost is large. External CFRP reinforcement is non-destructive to the structure and has a low cost. Therefore, reinforcement methods such as external CFRP cloth and CFRP mesh have certain advantages for concrete bridge deck slab reinforcement. The fatigue damage process of reinforced concrete ribbed girder bridge deck slabs is complex, making it difficult to determine a reasonable and effective reinforcement method to extend their service lives. At present, research on deck slab strengthening technology is far less than that on other components, such as beams and columns [32], and studies on fatigue-strengthening technology of reinforced concrete ribbed girder bridge deck slabs are even fewer. Therefore, it is of practical significance to develop an external laminated steel plate and CFRP material to strengthen a bridge deck slab and study the changes in its fatigue life. To facilitate inspection and maintenance, the external steel plate reinforcement can be cut into strips, pasted at a certain distance from the bottom of the plate, and anchored at the end [33\u201336]. Liqiang et al. [37] conducted a fatigue test study on steel-UHPC bridge deck slabs reinforced with steel plate strips. Xiaosan et al. [38] carried out a computational analysis of reinforced concrete slabs strengthened by compression steel plates. Qing et al. [39] carried out the theoretical derivation by reinforcing the original structure with a combination of steel plate and concrete. An experimental study of the strip-steel plate reinforcement of reinforced concrete (RC) ribbed girder bridge deck slabs has not yet been conducted. The strip-shaped steel plate reinforcement refers to the deck plate reinforcement method of the Shadun Port Bridge in China, with a steel plate size of 1150 mm \u00d7 200 mm \u00d7 10 mm, net distance between the strips of 200 mm, and anchor bolt size of M12 \u00d7 150 mm. Oh et al. [40,41] used CFRP cloth to strengthen bridge deck slabs and concluded that the life of bridge deck slabs was significantly extended after strengthening. Drar et al. [42]\nPolymers 2022, 14, 3814 3 of 21\nperformed a fatigue analysis on FRP-strengthened reinforced concrete slabs under moving loads. Teng et al. [43] conducted structural performance analysis on FRP-strengthened reinforced concrete slabs under cyclic loading of moving wheels. Shill et al. [44] conducted a flexural test study on a two-way concrete slab reinforced with basalt, and Martin No\u00ebl et al. [45] studied the shear performance of the post-tensioned FRP reinforced concrete slabs, under static and fatigue loading. In general, few studies have been conducted on CFRP-cloth-reinforced RC ribbed girder bridge deck slabs. Referring to literature [7,46] on the CFRP cloth-reinforcement method, the width of the cloth strips was selected as 150\u2013200 mm, and the net distance between the strips was selected as 200\u2013300 mm for the reinforcement of RC ribbed girder bridge deck slabs. At present, there are no reports related to CFRP mesh in the reinforcement of RC ribbed girder bridge deck slabs. Referring to the literature [8,47], CFN200/200 bidirectional CFRP mesh was selected to strengthen the deck slab of an RC ribbed girder bridge in this study. This study focused on the fatigue damage of concrete ribbed girder bridge deck slabs by performing fixed-point equal-amplitude fatigue loading tests with reduced-scale test girders to explore the complementary effect of commonly used strengthening methods on the fatigue resistance of RC ribbed girder bridge deck slabs and the ability to restore and extend their service life. The novelty of the research reported in this paper is that it explores suitable strengthening methods for the fatigue resistance of reinforced concrete ribbed girder bridge deck slabs. The research addresses the safe operation of the deck slabs of reinforced concrete ribbed girder bridges in service and provides guidance on the engineering application, which will be carried out in depth in real bridge strengthening in the future."

Failure Modes and Crack Development Patterns\nA static load damage test was performed on the PL1 test beam with a cracking load of 31.45 kN and ultimate load of 74.23 kN. Punching shear damage occurred at the loading point of the bridge deck slab, as seen in Figure 8. The minimum value of the reciprocating load of the PL2\u2013PL5 test girders was 1 kN, and the maximum value was 37.4 kN. The maximum value was because of the PL1 ultimate load and fatigue load level of 0.515. The PL2 deck slab exhibited a fatigue fracture at the main crack. At the moment of fracture, the concrete in the compressed area at the loading point was crushed, and punching shear damage occurred, as shown in Figure 9. During the fatigue test, all reinforced deck slabs exceeded two million fatigue cycles. The fatigue life was approximately 1.6 to 2 times that of an unreinforced beam. The reinforced deck slab was fatigue-fractured at the main crack, and a fracture sound could sometimes be heard at the time of fracture. At the moment of fracture, the concrete in the pressure zone at the loading point was crushed, and punching shear fatigue damage occurred. As the PL4 cracks were difficult to observe, the CFRP mesh was broken and lifted for observation after the test. The fatigue damages of PL3, PL4, and PL5 are shown in Figures 10\u201312. The fatigue damage of the reinforced deck slab appeared as brittle damage. The area around the hole was similar to that of the fatigue damage of the unreinforced deck slab, and it was smaller than the area around the hole in the static load damage. Regarding the fatigue failure characteristics, the fatigue failure of reinforced bridge deck slabs is mainly in the form of brittle fracture of reinforced steel. In fatigue failure, the reinforcing material peels. Finally, under the shear of the load, the steel will be pulled out by fatigue, and the bridge deck will collapse and lose its bearing capacity.

            "text": "A static load damage test was performed on the PL1 test beam with a cracking load of 31.45 kN and ultimate load of 74.23 kN. Punching shear damage occurred at the loading point of the bridge deck slab, as seen in Figure 8. The minimum value of the reciprocating load of the PL2\u2013PL5 test girders was 1 kN, and the maximum value was 37.4 kN. The maximum value was because of the PL1 ultimate load and fatigue load level of 0.515. The PL2 deck slab exhibited a fatigue fracture at the main crack. At the moment of fracture, the concrete in the compressed area at the loading point was crushed, and punching shear damage occurred, as shown in Figure 9. During the fatigue test, all reinforced deck slabs exceeded two million fatigue cycles. The fatigue life was approximately 1.6 to 2 times that of an unreinforced beam. The reinforced deck slab was fatigue-fractured at the main crack, and a fracture sound could sometimes be heard at the time of fracture. At the moment of fracture, the concrete in the pressure zone at the loading point was crushed, and punching shear fatigue damage occurred. As the PL4 cracks were difficult to observe, the CFRP mesh was broken and lifted for observation after the test. The fatigue damages of PL3, PL4, and PL5 are shown in Figures 10\u201312. The fatigue damage of the reinforced deck slab appeared as brittle damage. The area around the hole was similar to that of the fatigue damage of the unreinforced deck slab, and it was smaller than the area around the hole in the static load damage. Regarding the fatigue failure characteristics, the fatigue failure of reinforced bridge deck slabs is mainly in the form of brittle fracture of reinforced steel. In fatigue failure, the reinforcing material peels. Finally, under the shear of the load, the steel will be pulled out by fatigue, and the bridge deck will collapse and lose its bearing capacity. Overall, after reinforcement, the bridge deck slab improved its ability to resist dynamic loads, reduced its brittleness, and slightly improved its ductility. In the fatigue test, the crack development in the reinforced bridge deck slabs was relatively slow. The PL2 deck slab cracks were divided into four stages. In the initial development stage, fine cracks developed mainly in one direction. In the stable development stage, transverse and longitudinal cracks with lattice-like signs were observed. In the rapid development stage, cracks with a seam width of 0.2 mm or more propagated rapidly, and new cracks appeared between the existing cracks. In the damage stage, the longitudinal cracks instantly became the primary damage cracks, and the crack width reached 0.45 mm. The cracks were roughly distributed radially, with lattice-like signs in the center, and the number and length of crack roots were greater than those in the static load test. PL3, PL4, and PL5 were subjected to fatigue loading before reinforcement approximately 500,000 to 750,000 times. Reinforcement was performed when cracks with lattice signs appeared. The fatigue crack development processes of PL3 and PL5 bridge deck slabs were similar. During the initial development stage, cracks with lattice signs developed to some extent with the increase in fatigue loading cycles; however, because of the restraining effect of the reinforcement material, lattice-like cracks tended to propagate slowly. During\nPolymers 2022, 14, 3814 10 of 21\nthe stable development stage, transverse, longitudinal, and lattice cracks formed. In the rapid development stage, cracks with a width of more than 0.2 mm rapidly increased, and new cracks appeared between the existing cracks. At this point, the concrete and reinforcement material interfaces began to separate. In the damage stage, transverse or oblique cracks quickly became the main cracks of destruction. The crack width reached 0.4\u20130.5 mm, and the cracks were roughly radially distributed during damage. There were lattice-like signs in the center, and the number and length of crack roots were greater than those of unreinforced PL2. The PL4 deck slab, because of the two-way restraint effect of the CFRP mesh, had a lower crack expansion speed than those of PL3 and PL5. The number and length of crack roots were smaller than those of PL3 and PL5 during the damage stage. There were no radial cracks, and the punching and cutting cracks at the junction of the deck slab and beam rib were the main damage cracks. The experiments showed that the tensile effect of the reinforcement material restrained the development of longitudinal deck slab cracking.

The slow propagation of the main cracks leads to many new cracks in the bridge deck in the rapid development stage, and the crack density increases accordingly.

            "text": "The data obtained from the measurement and observation system were combined and plotted against the change in the concrete tensile strain under the test beam slab with the number of fatigue cycles, as shown in Figure 13. PL4 is missing in Figure 13 because the observation system could not directly observe the PL4 concrete tensile strain. As shown in Figure 13, the concrete tensile strain exhibited linear growth with plastic accumulation damage during the early stage of fatigue. The concrete plastic deformation under the slab slowed down at the middle stage of fatigue, and at the late stage of fatigue, the concrete tensile strain increased rapidly, while the damage continued to increase. The transverse tensile strain of the PL2 bridge deck slab was always larger than the longitudinal tensile strain, and the transverse tensile strain became the main tensile strain for fatigue damage in the late fatigue stage. The transverse tensile strains of the PL3 and PL5 bridge deck slabs developed slowly with the restraining effect of the reinforcement material. In comparison, the longitudinal tensile strain developed more rapidly than the transverse tensile strain and finally became the main tensile strain of the fatigue damage. From the reinforcement materials, the performance of the CFRP cloth in inhibiting the cumulative fatigue deformation of the tensile strain was better than that of the strip steel plate. Regarding the growth rate, the growth rate of the concrete transverse tensile strain of reinforced deck slabs is significantly lower than that of unreinforced deck slabs. As shown in Figure 13b,c, at the late stage of degradation, the degradation rate of unreinforced concrete in the longitudinal direction of the bridge deck slab is greater than that of transverse concrete. This indicates that in one-way slab reinforcement, two-way reinforcement is more beneficial for extending the remaining life of the bridge deck slab. Figure 14 shows the variation in the tensile strain of the reinforcement in the test beam deck slab under fatigue loading. As shown in Figure 14, the transverse tensile strain of PL2 was closer to the longitudinal tensile strain, and its value was lower than those of PL3 and PL5. In the middle and early stages, the longitudinal tensile strain was less than the transverse tensile strain; in the later stage, the longitudinal tensile strain exceeded the transverse tensile strain. Finally, the longitudinal tensile strain significantly increased. The transverse tensile strain of the PL4 bridge deck was relatively close to the longitudinal tensile strain, and its value was lower than those of PL3 and PL5. When the fatigue cycle is 1 million times, the incremental value of the transverse tensile strain of reinforcing steel in the reinforced deck is approximately 50\u201375% of that of the unreinforced deck, and that of the longitudinal tensile strain of reinforcement is approximately 40% to 50%. In terms of growth rate, the degradation process of reinforcement steel in reinforced deck slabs is slower than in unreinforced deck slabs. These test results indicate that the CFRP mesh can strengthen the bridge deck in both directions, and the fatigue damage of the steel bars develops slowly after the bridge deck is reinforced.\nPolymers 2022, 14, 3814 13 of 21Polymers 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 14 of 23\n(a) (b)\n(c)\nFigure 13.

D was 0\u20130.2 during the latent period, 0.2\u20130.5 during the progressive period, 0.5\u20130.8 during the accelerated period, and 0.8 to 1.0 during the deterioration period. From the perspective of prevention and preservation, Japan\u2019s longlife repair plan states that the reinforcement period after the bridge deck is damaged must be between the advanced and accelerated periods. A previous study [7] determined that the reinforcement period of the PL3\u2013PL5 bridge decks after damage is approximately at the end of the progress period (D = 0.41), which is similar to the longlife repair concept of the Japanese bridge deck and conforms to the prevention and preservation strategy. From the test data of PL3\u2013PL5, after the bridge deck is reinforced once, the service life of the bridge deck is extended by approximately 53.3\u201378.9%, indicating that the reinforcement has a significant influence on the service life of the bridge deck. In terms of reinforcement materials, lightweight, high-strength, and corrosion-resistant CFRP materials have better fatigue reinforcement prospects than strip steel. Therefore, CFRP cloth strip reinforcement is more suitable for the fatigue reinforcement of bridge deck slabs."

            "text": "Wang [49] established a fatigue life prediction model for reinforced concrete ribbed girder bridge deck slabs based on fatigue damage product theory and test data under fatigue loading of concrete deck slabs with wheel movement, and the resulting S-N curves were as follows:\nLog (Fi/Fu) = \u22120.0557LogN \u2212 0.1737 (5)\nwhere, Fi is the base load value (KN), Fu is the ultimate punching shear load capacity of the concrete deck slab (KN), and N is the number of cycles. Combining the fatigue test data in this paper and the punching and cutting theory of the bridge deck slab, the S-N curve of the fatigue strengthened reinforced concrete ribbed girder bridge deck slab is obtained on the basis of Equation (5), as shown in Equation (6):\nLog (Fi/Fu,c) = \u22120.0361LogN \u2212 0.1037 (6)\nwhere Fu,c is the impact shear- bearing capacity of the bridge deck plate after reinforcement. In the literature [7], the fatigue performance of reinforced concrete bridge deck slabs with FRP material reinforcement was studied, and the S-N curve of reinforced concrete slabs was established, as shown in Equation (7):\nLog (P/PSX.c) = \u22120.06417LogN + Log0.850 (7)\nwhere PSX.C is the punch-cut load capacity of the reinforced concrete deck slab reinforced by FRP. Comparing Equations (6) and (7), it can be concluded that the two S-N curves have the same form and the parameters do not differ much; however, the slope of the S-N curve of Equation (6) is smaller, and the curve is relatively flat. Since a steel\u2013concrete composite girder deck slab was the target in the literature [7], this indicates that the S-N curves of the reinforced deck slab will be different depending on the type of deck slab."

            "text": "In this study, deck slabs of a reinforced concrete ribbed girder bridge with a reduced dimensional design were strengthened, and fatigue tests were conducted, which led to the following conclusions.\n1. Under fixed-point equal-amplitude fatigue loading, reinforced deck slabs produced radial cracks and punching shear damage. 2. When the number of load cycles exceeded 90% of the fatigue life, fatigue main cracks appeared in the reinforced deck slab at the loading point. 3. The fatigue life of bridge deck slabs was approximately 53.3\u201378.9% longer, when they are reinforced at the accumulated damage degree of 0.4. The fatigue life of bridge deck slabs reinforced with CFRP cloth or CFRP mesh was 22.1\u201325.6% more than that of bridge deck slabs reinforced with strip steel plates. 4. Under the same fatigue load, both CFRP cloth and CFRP mesh were more effective than the strip-steel plate reinforcement for the fatigue reinforcement of bridge deck slabs. From a health monitoring perspective, CFRP cloth is more suitable for the fatigue reinforcement of bridge deck slabs.\nThis study, based on experimental data, explores the feasibility of strengthening bridge deck slabs with CFRP and other materials. In the future, finite element modeling and analytical modeling of prefabricated specimens will be carried out to obtain the fatigue damage law under different reinforcement conditions.\nPolymers 2022, 14, 3814 20 of 21\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, S.T.; methodology, S.T.; software, X.Z.; validation, S.T., X.Z. and W.H.; formal analysis, S.T.; investigation, S.T.; resources, S.T.; data curation, X.Z.; writing\u2014 original draft preparation, S.T.; writing\u2014review and editing, W.H.; visualization, X.Z.; supervision, S.T.; project administration, S.T.; funding acquisition, S.T.
