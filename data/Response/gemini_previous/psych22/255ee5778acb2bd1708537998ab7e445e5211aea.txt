1. **Investigate the use of different facial feature extraction networks.** The paper uses the FaceNet architecture as the facial feature extractor. However, there are many other facial feature extraction networks available, such as OpenFace and VGGFace2. It would be interesting to see how these different networks perform on the task of dynamic facial expression recognition.
2. **Explore the use of different time series classification algorithms.** The paper uses the InceptionTime algorithm as the time series classifier. However, there are many other time series classification algorithms available, such as ResNet and FCN. It would be interesting to see how these different algorithms perform on the task of dynamic facial expression recognition.
3. **Investigate the use of different synthetic data generation methods.** The paper uses the MakeHuman toolkit and the FACSHuman plugin to generate synthetic data. However, there are many other synthetic data generation methods available, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs). It would be interesting to see how these different methods perform on the task of dynamic facial expression recognition.
4. **Explore the use of audiovisual data for dynamic facial expression recognition.** The paper focuses on using only visual data for dynamic facial expression recognition. However, audiovisual data can also be used for this task. It would be interesting to see how the addition of audiovisual data can improve the performance of dynamic facial expression recognition systems.
5. **Investigate the use of dynamic facial expression recognition systems for human-robot interaction.** The paper focuses on the development of dynamic facial expression recognition systems for use in human-robot interaction. However, there are many other potential applications for these systems, such as healthcare, education, and entertainment. It would be interesting to explore these different applications and see how dynamic facial expression recognition systems can be used to improve them.
