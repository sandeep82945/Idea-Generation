    "abstractText": "10 Cytosine deaminases have important uses in the detection of epigenetic modifications and in genome 11 editing. However, the range of applications of deaminases is limited by a small number of well 12 characterized enzymes. To expand the toolkit of deaminases, we developed an in-vitro approach that 13 bypasses a major hurdle with their severe toxicity in expression hosts. We systematically assayed the 14 activity of 175 putative cytosine deaminases on an unprecedented variety of substrates with 15 epigenetically relevant base modifications. We found enzymes with high activity on doubleand single16 stranded DNA in various sequence contexts including novel CpG-specific deaminases, as well as enzymes 17 without sequence preference. We also report, for the first time, enzymes that do not deaminate 18 modified cytosines. The remarkable diversity of cytosine deaminases opens new avenues for 19 biotechnological and medical applications. Using a newly discovered non-specific, modification-sensitive 20 double-stranded DNA deaminase, we developed a nondestructive single-enzyme 5-methylctyosine 21 sequencing (SEM-seq) method. SEM-seq enables accurate, high-coverage, base-resolution methylome 22 mapping of scarce biological material including clinically relevant cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and single-cell 23 equivalent 10 pg input DNA. Using SEM-seq, we generated highly reproducible base-resolution 5mC 24 maps, accounting for nearly 80% of CpG islands for a low input human cfDNA sample offering valuable 25 information for identifying potential biomarkers for detection of early-stage cancer and other diseases. 26 This streamlined protocol will enable robust, high-throughput, high-coverage epigenome profiling of 27 challenging samples in research and clinical settings. 28 Introduction 29 Cytosine deaminases are widespread enzymes that are involved in numerous important cellular 30 processes. In eukaryotes, the APOBEC (Apolipoprotein B mRNA Editing Catalytic Polypeptide-like) family 31 of proteins plays important roles in antibody diversification and innate immunity against retroviruses. 32 In bacteria, deaminases are found in polymorphic toxin systems (PTS), which are multi-domain proteins 33 involved in intraand interspecies competition. Deaminases which act on nucleic acids have been 34 used in many biotechnological applications, including as key components of base editing tools and in 35 assays to detect various DNA and RNA modifications. 36 .

            "text": "editing. However, the range of applications of deaminases is limited by a small number of well 12 characterized enzymes. To expand the toolkit of deaminases, we developed an in-vitro approach that 13 bypasses a major hurdle with their severe toxicity in expression hosts. We systematically assayed the 14 activity of 175 putative cytosine deaminases on an unprecedented variety of substrates with 15 epigenetically relevant base modifications. We found enzymes with high activity on double- and single-16 stranded DNA in various sequence contexts including novel CpG-specific deaminases, as well as enzymes 17 without sequence preference. We also report, for the first time, enzymes that do not deaminate 18 modified cytosines. The remarkable diversity of cytosine deaminases opens new avenues for 19 biotechnological and medical applications. Using a newly discovered non-specific, modification-sensitive 20 double-stranded DNA deaminase, we developed a nondestructive single-enzyme 5-methylctyosine 21 sequencing (SEM-seq) method. SEM-seq enables accurate, high-coverage, base-resolution methylome 22 mapping of scarce biological material including clinically relevant cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and single-cell 23 equivalent 10 pg input DNA. Using SEM-seq, we generated highly reproducible base-resolution 5mC 24 maps, accounting for nearly 80% of CpG islands for a low input human cfDNA sample offering valuable 25 information for identifying potential biomarkers for detection of early-stage cancer and other diseases. 26 This streamlined protocol will enable robust, high-throughput, high-coverage epigenome profiling of 27 challenging samples in research and clinical settings. 28\nIntroduction 29 Cytosine deaminases are widespread enzymes that are involved in numerous important cellular 30 processes. In eukaryotes, the APOBEC (Apolipoprotein B mRNA Editing Catalytic Polypeptide-like) family 31 of proteins plays important roles in antibody diversification and innate immunity against retroviruses1. 32 In bacteria, deaminases are found in polymorphic toxin systems (PTS), which are multi-domain proteins 33 involved in intra- and interspecies competition2\u20134. Deaminases which act on nucleic acids have been 34 used in many biotechnological applications, including as key components of base editing tools5\u20137 and in 35 assays to detect various DNA and RNA modifications8\u201312. 36\nRecently, APOBEC3A deaminase was featured as a non-destructive enzymatic alternative to bisulfite 37 conversion to detect 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) DNA modifications 38 (EM-seq9 , LR-EM-seq10 and ACE-seq11). APOBEC3A deaminates cytosine (C) to uridine (U) in single-39 stranded DNA (ssDNA). APOBEC3A also deaminates 5mC and 5hmC, albeit with reduced activity, but 40 does not deaminate 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) and glucosylated 5hmC (5gmC). In ABOBEC3A-based 41 modification detection assays, 5mC can be protected through conversion to 5caC and 5gmC by 42 combined Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2) and T4-phage beta-glucosyl transferase (T4-BGT) 43 activity. 44\nCompared to bisulfite conversion-based sequencing methods13, enzymatic deamination protocols do not 45 damage DNA, require lower amounts of input DNA, produce less biased data, and are more compatible 46 with long read sequencing and enrichment of long amplicons9\u201311. We envisioned that the discovery of 47 deaminases with new properties would open the possibility of leaping beyond some of the limitations of 48 current enzymatic methods. Specifically, sequence-agnostic robust activity on double-stranded DNA 49 (dsDNA) combined with a lack of activity on 5mC and 5hmC would enable a streamlined, one-step, one-50 enzyme protocol for 5mC mapping. 51\nAbout a decade ago, Iyer, Zhang, and colleagues reported extensive computational analyses of the 52 diversity and phylogenetic distribution of enzymes with the deaminase fold, including a large variety of 53 putative cytosine deaminases found in bacterial polymorphic toxin systems2,3. For many years, most of 54 that sequence space remained unexplored experimentally. Recently, Mok, de Moraes, and colleagues 55 described the characterization, engineering, and application to base editing of DddA, of a cytosine 56 deaminase from bacterial toxin systems acting on dsDNA substrates5\u20137. We considered DddA unsuitable 57 for epigenetics modification detection due to its overall low activity and strong sequence preference. 58 Nevertheless, inspired by these earlier works, we endeavored to discover and characterize a broader 59 range of putative cytosine deaminases and assess their suitability for cytosine modification detection 60 and other applications. 61\nIn this study, we report an extensive survey of the enzymatic activity of cytosine deaminases from 62 bacterial polymorphic toxin systems, phages, and gene cassettes. We expressed deaminases using an in-63 vitro system that circumvents their well-documented host toxicity and assayed 175 enzymes from 13 64 deaminase families. Combining Liquid Chromatography\u2013Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) and Next 65 Generation Sequencing (NGS) methods, we measured their deaminase activity and substrate selectivity 66 on ssDNA, dsDNA, using unmodified and modified substrates incorporating 5-methylcytosine (5mC), 5-67 hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC), 5-carboxycytosine (5caC), 5-68 glucosyloxymethylcytosine (5gmC), and N4-methylcytosine (N4mC). Our work uncovered bacterial 69 deaminases with diverse activities, including enzymes with a wide range of sequence preferences and 70 modification sensitivities on ssDNA and dsDNA. We identified a subset of enzymes with properties 71 desirable for improving epigenetic modification detection methods. Most notably, we found a 72 modification-sensitive deaminase that is active on dsDNA without sequence constraints. We 73 demonstrated the application of this enzyme in a new one-tube deaminase-mediated sequencing 74 method, SEM-seq, for human methylome profiling. 75\nResults 76\nIn-vitro screening of 175 deaminase sequences 77 We developed a bioinformatics strategy to look for putative DNA deaminase sequences from public 78 databases. Then, we devised an experimental pipeline to test deamination activity in-vitro (Fig. 1a). 79\nUsing as queries, HMMER314 deaminase family profiles from Pfam15 and reports by Iyer, Zhang and 80 colleagues2,3 (Supplementary Fig. 1), we searched for new deaminases in six different databases, with 81 most candidates coming from UniProt16 or Mgnify17. We picked hits from diverse deaminase families 82 with the intent to cover a broad range of the sequence space and thus catalog deaminase activities. 83 Candidate selection was performed over many iterations. Active enzymes in our initial screen primarily 84 derived from bacterial polymorphic toxin systems. Later rounds focused on sequences in the same 85 families as those of the active enzymes from previous selections. 86\nBecause of their inherent toxicity to expression hosts, deaminases are often obtained in low yields, or 87 are subjected to mutations that inactivate enzymatic activity. As such, putative deaminase proteins were 88 expressed using an in-vitro protein synthesis system. An LC-MS-based assay was developed to quantify 89 deaminase activities on unmodified cytosines in ssDNA, dsDNA, and RNA substrates. The single-stranded 90 \u03a6X174 Virion DNA and the double-stranded \u03a6X174 RF I DNA, sharing the same template sequence were 91 used as DNA substrates. These 5,386-nucleotide (nt) length substrates present C in a rich diversity of 92 sequence contexts, thus allowing the detection of deaminase activities regardless of the sequence 93 specificities. Isotope labeled firefly luciferase (Fluc) mRNA was used as the substrate for testing 94 deaminase activity on RNA for a subset of deaminases. 95\nWe validate our screening assay on the previously published SsdA and DddA enzymes. Considering the 96 potential mutagenicity of DNA deaminases, we compared the use of the PURExpress in-vitro protein 97 synthesis system with different transcription templates. These were composed of either unmodified 98 DNA or of DNA with 5hmdC in place of dC to potentially block template mutation during the 99\ntranscription and translation reactions. Of note, DNA templates constructed from the 5hmdCTP and 100 dCTP generated similar results (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Further investigation showed that deaminase 101 activity is inhibited by the 1X PURExpress buffer (Supplementary Fig. 2b) but can be rescued in the 102 diluted buffer. Our data suggested this is a viable approach to efficiently produce active proteins of toxic 103 deaminases for further characterization. As a case in point, we showed by LC-MS analysis that SsdA, like 104 APOBEC3A, prefers ssDNA, and DddA is active on dsDNA (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 2 c,d), which is 105 in agreement with the published results. We further uncovered that all these three enzymes have equal 106 or better activity in a lower pH buffer (pH 6)18 than that of a previously published buffer (pH 7.5)7 (Fig. 107 1b,c). 108\nWe screened a total of 175 new enzymes across 13 cytosine deaminase families (Fig. 1d,e, 109 Supplementary Fig. 1). Our assay revealed that many bacterial DNA deaminases act on both ssDNA and 110 dsDNA, with some deaminating both types of substrates with equal efficiency. Five deaminase families, 111 DddA-like, SsdA-like, Pput2613, MafB19, and MsddA-like, accounted for nearly all enzymes with DNA 112 activity detectable by LC-MS (Fig. 1d,e). In four of the five families, at least one deaminase was found 113 with higher RNA deaminase activity than APOBEC3A (Supplementary Fig. 3), which has previously been 114 reported to have activity on RNA substrates19. Examples of enzymes highly active on DNA were CseDa01, 115 MGYPDa06, and LbDa02, which deaminated close to 100% of cytosines in dsDNA and ssDNA substrates; 116\nCrDa01, which deaminated 87% and 97% of cytosines in dsDNA and ssDNA, respectively; and 117 MGYPDa829 and LbsDa01, which deaminated about 75% of cytosines in both dsDNA and ssDNA 118 substrates. When we tested at lower concentrations, MGYPDa829 (DddA-like) showed equal activity on 119 ssDNA and dsDNA, whereas CseDa01 (SsdA-like) preferred ssDNA (Supplementary Fig. 4). Overall, most 120 of the active bacterial deaminases display a preference for ssDNA substrates. While we found a few 121 cytosine deaminases that strongly prefer single-stranded substrates, such as HcDa01 and StsDa01, we 122 did not find a single bacterial deaminase that only acts on dsDNA. For simplicity, herein we will use the 123 term \u201cdsDNA deaminase\u201d for enzymes that act on dsDNA, even though they also deaminate ssDNA to 124 some extent. 125\nA wide spectrum of sensitivity to DNA cytosine modifications 135 We next measured deaminase activity on a variety of physiologically relevant cytosine modifications. We 136 developed an NGS assay to characterize deaminase sequence preference and sensitivity to 5C-137 methylation, 5C-hydroxymethylation, 5C-glucosylation, and N4-methylation (N4mC) in both single-138 stranded and double-stranded DNA. In addition, we used the LC-MS assay to examine activity on 5C-139 formylated, and 5C-carboxylated substrates. To validate these methods, we showed that the 140 deamination efficiency on unmodified substrates measured by NGS was broadly consistent with that of 141 LC-MS (Pearson r = 0.85 and 0.86 for ssDNA and dsDNA respectively) (Supplementary Fig. 5). 142\nWe found that the screened enzymes generally had low activity on N4mC (Supplementary Fig. 6) but 143 displayed a wide spectrum of activities on different modification types at the cytosine 5-position (Fig. 2, 144 Supplementary Fig. 7). We clustered the deaminases into five functional clusters based on their 145 specificity for C, 5mC, 5hmC and 5gmC in dsDNA. Most deaminases showed a moderate decrease of 146 activity toward 5mC and 5hmC modifications, and a strong decrease of activity toward 5gmC compared 147 to unmodified dsDNA substrates (Fig. 2a,b, clusters #2 and 4). A subset of deaminases displayed similar 148 activities across all the cytosine types (Fig. 2a,b, cluster #1). This group includes CseDa01, which 149 efficiently deaminates C, 5mC, 5hmC, and even gmC to nearly 100%. Another interesting subset showed 150 decreased activity on 5mC and 5gmC, but not on 5hmC (Fig. 2a,b, cluster #3). This subset, which includes 151 PfDa01 and SsdA, can potentially be used to distinguish 5hmC from 5mC. Enzymes from clusters #1-4 152 tended to have more relaxed modification sensitivity to ssDNA compared to dsDNA (Supplementary Fig. 153 7). The most exciting discovery was of a unique functional cluster with very low or no activity on 154 modified substrates (Fig. 2a,b, cluster #5). The enzymes from cluster #5 with the highest deamination 155 activity of unmodified C were found to be phylogenetically related (Fig. 1e). We referred to the most 156 active enzyme of this group (92% of unmodified cytosine deaminated and less than 3% of the modified 157 cytosines), originating from human mouth metagenome (European Nucleotide Archive accession 158 ERZ773077)20, as \u201cModification-Sensitive DNA Deaminase A\u201d (MsddA) and the family of deaminases 159 related to it as MsddA-like. 160\nWe also examined deamination activities on 5fC and 5caC of representative enzymes from each family 161 using ssDNA oligonucleotide substrates containing four cytosines in a \u2018Cg\u2019 context in which all cytosines 162 were either unmodified, 5-formylated, or 5-carboxylated (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Fig. 8). We observed 163 that MsddA, EcDa01 (MafB19 family), and the two enzymes from the Pput2613 family did not 164 deaminate either modified substrate. In contrast, all other tested deaminases displayed some activity on 165 5fC, and the three enzymes from the DddA-like family had activity on both 5fC and 5caC. 166\nA wide variety of DNA sequence preferences 174 The single-base resolution of our NGS assay and the use of a large size and sequence complexity of 175 substrates enabled us to accurately survey the sequence preference landscape for our deaminase 176 library. Sequence Logo plotting22 of 10-base context on either side of sites deaminated in unmodified 177 dsDNA uncovered a diversity of context preferences (Fig. 3a-c, Supplementary Fig. 9), including a subset 178 of enzymes that display no sequence constraints (Fig. 3a). The non-specific enzymes also tend to have 179 high overall activity (Fig. 3d). In addition to displaying different preferences for sequences at the 5\u2019 end 180 position(s) to the deaminated cytosine, reminiscent of enzymes from the eukaryotic APOBEC deaminase 181 family18, many bacterial deaminases display sequence selectivity for the immediate 3\u2019 position, some 182 specifically recognizing CpG dinucleotides (Fig. 3b,d). Deaminase recognition sequence sites can extend 183 beyond the nCn context, with preferences for sequences of various lengths and compositions (Fig. 3c). 184\nAs a more systematic analysis of sequence preference across different substrate types, we calculated 185 the average deamination efficiency of all nCn sequences in unmodified and modified dsDNA and ssDNA 186 substrates and conducted clustering analysis across diverse enzymes and specificities (Fig. 3d, 187 Supplementary Fig. 10). We observed that enzymes from the same family tend to cluster together. For 188 example, MafB19 deaminases tend to prefer Cg, DddA-like deaminases tend to prefer tC, and MsddA-189 like deaminases tend to have reduced activity on Ca. However, all five families contained examples of 190 non-specific deaminases (Fig. 3a). Specificities were generally consistent across substrates, noting that 191 enzymes tend to display more context specific preferences on substrates on which they had lower total 192 activity (Supplementary Fig. 10). 193\n194\n204\nSEM-seq, a nondestructive streamlined single-enzyme methylation sequencing method 205\nfor accurate base-resolution methylome analysis 206 The discovery of the non-specific methylation-sensitive dsDNA deaminase MsddA enabled us to perform 207 SEM-seq, a single-enzyme method for methylation sequencing at single base resolution. SEM-seq 208 eliminated the need for TET2/T4-BGT protection and denaturing steps that are required of APOEC3A-209 based protocols (Fig. 4a). 210\nWe validated SEM-seq using genomic DNA from the human GM12878 cell line and benchmarked it 211 against two published datasets from standard EM-seq9 and WGBS (ENCODE accession ENCSR890UQO)23 212 protocols. Unmethylated lambda and CpG-methylated pUC19 DNA were spiked in as controls to 213 estimate deamination rates. Two technical replicates of SEM-seq were sequenced on the Illumina Nova-214 seq platform. 277 million paired-end reads from two replicates of each method were used for the 215 comparative analyses. 216\nThe library quality metrics and methylation results were highly consistent between technical replicates, 217 suggesting a high reproducibility and robustness of SEM-seq (Supplementary Fig. 11). SEM-seq libraries 218 produced very similar CpG methylation results for human GM12878 as those of EM-seq and WGBS (Fig. 219 4b-d), despite a slightly lower deamination rate on unmodified cytosines for lambda phage DNA (SEM-220 seq 98.0%, EM-seq 98.8%; WGBS 99.4%). The 5mC conversion rates calculated from the CpG-methylated 221 pUC19 DNA were 95.4% and 95.7% for each of the two SEM-seq replicates. These data were nearly 222 identical to that of EM-seq (~96%) (Fig. 4b), but without requiring protection by TET2 and BGT. After 223 combining the data of the two technical replicates, SEM-seq identified 40.4 million high-confidence 224 methylated CpG sites, of which 86% and 84% agreed with EM-seq and WGBS datasets, respectively (Fig. 225 4c). The methylation levels of commonly methylated CpG sites are also highly correlated between SEM-226 seq and the other two methods (Pearson correlations: SEM-seq vs. EM-seq 0.91, SEM-seq vs. WGBS 227 0.88, EM-seq vs. WGBS 0.90). SEM-seq accurately produced the expected CpG methylation profiles for 228 key epigenomic features, such as an enrichment of methylation in CpG islands, a reduced methylation 229 levels near transcription start sites and at active chromatin markers and enhancers, and a typical 230 regularly spaced oscillation pattern surrounding CTCF binding sites with depleted methylation at the 231 center24 (Fig. 4d). Furthermore, SEM-seq, like EM-seq, is non-destructive and gives more even read 232 coverage across genomic regions of variable GC contents than the bisulfite-based WGBS method (Fig. 233 4e). 234\nSEM-seq for cfDNA and 10 pg input 235 The streamlined, robust protocol of SEM-seq makes it an advantageous method for obtaining accurate 236 and highly reproducible methylome information from scarce biological samples such as cell free DNA 237 (cfDNA), which has important clinical applications for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis and early cancer 238 detection and monitoring25. We applied SEM-seq to human cell free DNA (cfDNA) and sequenced two 239 replicate SEM-seq libraries each using 3 ng of cfDNA, generating 187.0 million and 204.5 million paired-240 end reads. The two cfDNA libraries covered 26.6 million and 30.6 million CpG sites respectively with at 241 least 3X coverage. Among them, 25.6 and 29.4 million methylated CpG sites were identified with 18.5 242 million agreeing between the two replicates (Supplementary Fig. 12a). The methylation levels of 243 individual CpG sites also correlated well between the replicates (Pearson correlation=0.71) 244 demonstrating accurate, base resolution quantification. A single cfDNA SEM-seq library generated 245 accurate 5mC profiles in epigenetic important genomic features resembling those of the human 246\nGM12878 genomic DNA (Fig. 5a, Supplementary Fig. 12b). Remarkably, SEM-seq was able to provide 247 single-base-resolution 5mC quantification of 21536 CpG islands accounting for 78% of annotated CpG 248 islands in the human genome, leading to the detection of 11426 hypomethylated (methylation level 249 <20%) and 6712 hypermethylated (methylation level >70%) CpG islands and their associated genes 250 (Supplementary Fig. 12c, Supplementary Table S1). As expected, gene promoter regions are depleted in 251 5mC globally. SEM-seq allowed us to further examine the distribution and methylation level of individual 252 cytosine sites of each gene at a finer resolution. Consistent with the global trend, many promoter 253 regions are hypomethylated, for example the N-glycanase 1 (NGLY1) promoter (Fig. 5b). However, a 254 subset of genes are heavily modified in the promoter, such as BCL6 corepressor like 1 (BCORL1) (Fig. 255 5c)\u2014a transcriptional corepressor that was suggested a prognostic factor that promotes tumor 256 metastasis26, and LDL receptor related protein 5 like (LRP5L), of which a CpG island near the TSS is also 257 hypermethylated (Fig. 5d). Such high-resolution methylation information is very valuable for detecting 258 aberrant DNA methylation in cancer and other diseased samples and identify potential biomarkers for 259 detection and classification of early-stage cancer. 260\nWe also made SEM-seq libraries from only 10 pg of human GM12878 DNA, equivalent to single cell 261 input27. With 28 million paired-end reads, a single 10 pg library covered 9.3 M CpG sites and 8219 (30%) 262 CpG islands. It revealed similar methylation patterns to the 50 ng EM-seq and SEM-seq libraries, with 263 low GC coverage bias (Fig. 4e), and the expected 5mC distributions at various key genomic features (Fig. 264 4d). This result suggests that SEM-seq is suitable for single-cell methylome studies. 265\n281\nDiscussion 282 This work presents a systematic experimental screening of 175 new cytosine deaminases spanning 13 283 distinct deaminase families. Screened enzymes cover most deaminase families that have been 284 hypothesized to act on cytosines2,3. Nearly all the active bacterial deaminases we characterized are 285 found in polymorphic toxin systems (PTS) and come from five of the 13 families: SsdA-like, DddA-like, 286 MafB19, Pput2613, and MsddA-like. The last of which we christened in reflection of the sensitivity to 287 modified cytosines displayed by many of its members. 288\nOur screen reveals that bacterial deaminases are a versatile group of enzymes with diverse and 289 previously unknown properties. We show that many bacterial deaminases act on dsDNA, contrasting 290 with earlier observations that most DNA cytosine deaminases strongly prefer ssDNA substrates. While 291 some bacterial DNA deaminases are strictly single-strand specific enzymes, which parallels all the known 292 eukaryotic DNA deaminases, we did not find any deaminases that only accept double-strand DNA 293 substrates. This suggests that the deamination activity on single-stranded substrates may be the 294 ancestral state of all the bacterial deaminases. 295\nSeveral recent studies have reported a functional characterization of enzymes from the DddA-like 296 family28\u201330. One study28 showed that deletion of SPKK-related motifs at the C-terminus of DddA 297 abrogates its activity on dsDNA. In agreement with those results, we found that StsDa01, a deaminase 298 from the DddA-like family, lacks a C-terminal SPKK-related motif and strongly prefers ssDNA substrates. 299 Furthermore, we found that by truncating the C-terminus of MGYPDa829, this enzyme was converted 300 from having similar activity on both dsDNA and ssDNA to strongly preferring ssDNA (Supplementary Fig. 301 13). The enzyme resulting from a swap of the C-terminus from MGYPDa829 onto StsDa01 retained a 302 strong preference for ssDNA. We observed that dsDNA deaminases outside the DddA-like family lack 303 SPKK-related motifs, therefore the association between dsDNA activity and the SPKK-related motif does 304 not seem to generalize beyond the DddA-like family. 305\nBacterial deaminase activities also vary widely across DNA modification types including 5mC, 5hmC, 5fC, 306 5caC, 5gmC, and N4mC. In contrast to a wide spectrum of activities on modifications at C-5 (Fig. 2), 307 including the first report of deaminases with strong activity on 5caC and 5gmC, the screened enzymes 308 generally had low activity on N4mC (Supplementary Fig. 6). Finally, we found that bacterial deaminases 309 display a broad spectrum of sequence specificities, including enzymes with no apparent biases, enzymes 310 with diverse sequence preferences at the 5\u2019 end position relative to the target C, and enzymes with 311 strong sequence preferences at the 3\u2019 end positions, particularly a strong bias toward CpG 312 dinucleotides. 313\nThe diverse properties of bacterial deaminases lend themselves to various applications, including as 314 base editors and for epigenetic modification mapping. Information on substrate preference serves as a 315 key for selecting suitable enzymes for different applications. In base editing applications, their small size 316 (100-200 amino acids) (Supplementary Fig. 14) could provide advantages for therapeutic delivery. Also, a 317 strong ssDNA preference coupled with different context specificities will likely help reduce off-target 318 editing. For detecting the important epigenetic mark 5mC, a sequence independent cytosine deaminase 319 that can discriminate between methylated and unmethylated sites would be ideally suited for broad 320 methylome analysis. Indeed, we demonstrate the successful application in human whole methylome 321 mapping of the non-specific, modification-sensitive dsDNA deaminase MsddA. Our streamlined 322 methylation sequencing protocol, SEM-seq, not only is free of the damage-inducing bisulfite treatment, 323\nbut also does not require any accessory protection proteins (TET2 and T4-BGT) nor harsh denaturing 324 steps. We leveraged the advantages of SEM-seq by successfully applying it to methylome analysis in 325 clinically relevant cfDNA and in challenging, single-cell equivalent, 10 pg input DNA samples. 326\nOur study unravels another example of the great potential for developing biotechnological tools from 327 previously unexploited bacterial and bacteriophage enzymes, in our case DNA methylation mapping 328 using bacterial DNA deaminase enzymes with diverse substrate preferences and modification 329 sensitivities. 330\nMethods 331\nCandidate selection 332 To guide the search for new enzymes, we first curated a list of HMMER314 cytosine deaminase sequence 333 profiles. 29 profiles came from the CDA clan (CL0109) from the Pfam15 database (version 34) (excluding 334 the TM1506, LpxI_C, FdhD-NarQ, and AICARFT_IMPCHas, which are thought to not encode deaminases), 335 17 profiles were built from multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) of deaminase families defined by Iyer 336 et al. (2011)2, and one profile was built from a multiple sequence alignment found in Zhang et al. 337 (2012)3. The profiles from Iyer largely overlap with the Pfam profiles, with a few differences, despite 338 some similar names (Supplementary Fig. 1). The Pfam MafB19-deam (PF14437) profile and the similarly 339 named profile from Iyer were found to be different from each other. None of the enzymes we screened 340 had a best profile match to the Pfam MafB19-deam profile, so our usage of MafB19 corresponds to the 341 Iyer profile. 342\nThe Pfam DYW_deaminase (PF14432) profile is biased towards eukaryotic members of that family, 343 whereas the similarly named profile from Iyer captures both eukaryotic and bacterial DYW deaminases. 344 We therefore split the Iyer DYW profile into three separate profiles, the one comprising mostly bacterial 345 enzymes we called SsdA-like, as it contains the previously described SsdA deaminase7, the other, which 346 more closely resembles the DYW profile from Pfam, we called Iyer2011_DYW, the combined profile we 347 called Iyer2011_DYW_combined (giving a new total of 18 profiles from Iyer). We found experimentally 348 that the enzymes with strong matches towards the profile from Zhang et al. 20123 tended to have poor 349 deamination activity on modified cytosines. We therefore renamed this profile MsddA-like, for 350 \u201cmodification sensitive DNA deaminase A-like\u201d. 351\nSome candidate sequences were selected directly from the MSAs listed in Iyer et al. (2011) and Zhang et 352 al. (2012). Others were selected from hmmsearch hits of the profiles described above against six 353 different databases: UniProt16, Mgnify17, IMG/VR31, IMG/M32, gene cassette metagenomes33, 354 wastewater treatment plant metagenomes34, and GenBank35. Candidate selection and experimental 355 screening were performed over many iterations. Candidates were selected from the hmmsearch hits 356 with the intent to cover a broad range of sequence space, but with a focus on sequences similar to those 357 that were shown to be active in earlier rounds. Mok et al. (2020)5 and de Moraes et al. (2021)7 358 previously reported on the active bacterial DNA deaminases, SsdA, DddA, and BadTF3, so similarity to 359 those enzymes was also used as a criterion for candidate selection. 360\nMost of the deaminases we tested were found as fusions to larger proteins, for example as parts of 361 polymorphic toxin systems. In our assays we only expressed the deaminase domain rather than the full 362 proteins. To determine the boundaries of the deaminase domain, we ran AlphaFold236 via the 363 LocalColabFold37 package on the deaminase domain plus up to about 1000 amino acids upstream and 364 downstream. We visualized the AlphaFold2 predicted structures in PyMOL. N-terminal truncation sites 365 were generally selected at several amino acids before helix 1 of the deaminase domain. The deaminase 366 domains were typically found at the C-terminus of the fusion protein, so for most sequences C-terminal 367 truncations were not necessary. For cases where the boundaries of the deaminase domain were difficult 368 to distinguish, we either tried several different truncations (Supplementary Fig. 15) or relied on the 369 Predicted Aligned Error (PAE) metric reported by AlphaFold2. We found that residues with a low PAE to 370 residues in the core of the deaminase domain corresponded to our intuitive notions of the boundaries 371 of the deaminase domain. To aid in the visualization of PAE, we developed a Colab notebook called 372\nPAEView 373 (https://github.com/seanrjohnson/proteinotes/blob/master/colab_notebooks/PAEView.ipynb). 374\nSequence naming 375 For convenience, each screened sequence was given a short name. The names are related to the 376 database or species of origin for the sequence. Da = deaminase, MGYP = Mgnify protein, Hm = hot 377 metagenome, VR = IMG/VR, WWTP = wastewater treatment plant, SoCa = soil gene cassette, chimera = 378 chimeric sequence. Other prefixes are mostly two or three letters drawn from the name of the source 379 organism or the source environment of the metagenome data. Some sequences also have prefixes or 380 suffixes of the form extN#, extC#, d#, Cd#, which indicate, respectively, N-terminal extensions, C-381 terminal extensions, N-terminal deletions, and C-terminal deletions of the indicated number of residues, 382 compared to the candidate with the un-affixed name. 383\nPhylogenetic Tree 384 Amino acid sequence alignments were all calculated using MUSCLE38. Trees were generated using raxml-385 ng (v. 1.1)39. The tree was rooted at the midpoint and rendered using ETE340. 386\nHmm profile comparison 387 Similarity between deaminase hmm profiles was computed using hmmer_compare.py, a new python 388 implementation of the algorithm described by S\u00f6ding41. Scores were calculated for each pair of profiles. 389 Scores were converted to distances using the formula: 390 391 distance = 1 - (pairwise_score / min(profile1_self_score, profile2_self_score)) 392 393 A UPGMA tree was generated from the distance matrix using scikit-learn42 and rendered with Geneious 394 Prime (https://www.geneious.com/) to visualize distances between profiles. 395 Code for generating hmmer3 profile trees and alignments is available at: 396 https://github.com/seanrjohnson/hmmer_compare 397\n398\nSources of DNA and RNA substrates 399 Unmodified DNA oligonucleotides were purchased from IDT Coralville, IA), 5caC and 5fC containing 400 oligonucleotides were synthesized by NEB (Ipswich, MA). dsDNA oligonucleotides were annealed in 10 401 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 8.0 buffer. E. coli C2566 genomic DNA was purified using Monarch Genomic DNA 402 Purification Kit (NEB Ipswich, MA), GM12878 genomic DNA was obtained from Coriell Cell Repositories 403 (Camden, NJ). Single donor human plasma was obtained from Innovative Research (Novi, MI) and cfDNA 404 was extracted using the BioChain (Newark, CA) cfPure MAX V2 Cell-Free DNA Extraction Kit. 405 Unmethylated cl857 Sam7 Lambda DNA (Promega, Fitchburg, WI), fully C-methylated XP12 phage DNA 406 (Dr. Yan-Jiun Lee, NEB Ipswich MA), fully C-hydroxymethylated T414743 and fully C-hydroxy-methyl-beta-407 glucosylated T4 alpha-glucosyl-transferase knockout (AGT-) genomic DNAs (Dr. Lidija Truncaite, Vilnius 408 University Life Sciences Center, Vilnius Lithuania), pRSSM1.PleII plasmid (containing N4mC at cacCgc 409 sites) (Dr. Iain Murray, NEB Ipswich MA) were used as spike in controls in NGS deamination assay. 410\nIsotope labeled firefly luciferase (Fluc) mRNA was synthesized by HiScribe T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis 411 Kit (E2040S, NEB, Ipswich) using stable heavy isotopes of ATP and CTP (NLM-3987-CA and CNLM-4267-412 CA-20, Cambridge Isotope Laboratory, Tewksbury, MA). Resulting Fluc mRNA was purified twice by 413 Monarch RNA cleanup kit (T2040S, NEB, Ipwsich, MA) to ensure that unincorporated nucleotides were 414\ncompletely removed. RNA was eluted in nuclease-free water, quantified by Qubit RNA broad range 415 assay (Q10211, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA) and stored at -20 \u00b0C. 416\nIn-vitro expression of deaminases 417 The candidate DNA deaminase genes first were codon-optimized then added flanking sequences 418 containing T7 promoter at 5\u2019 end (GCGAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCTTAAGTATAAGGAGGAAAAAAT) 419 and T7 terminator at 3\u2019 end (CTAGCATAACCCCTCTCTAAACGGAGGGGTTTATTTGG) and ordered as linear 420 gBlocks from IDT (Coralville, IA, USA). Template DNA for in vitro protein synthesis was generated with 421 Phusion\u00ae Hot Start Flex DNA Polymerase (NEB. Ipswich MA) using gBlocks as template and flanking 422 primers (Supplementary Table S2). The PCR products were purified using Monarch PCR and DNA 423 Cleanup kit (NEB, Ipswich, MA). DNA concentration was quantified using a NanoDrop 424 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA). 100 - 400 ng of PCR fragments were 425 used as template DNA to synthesize analytic amounts of DNA deaminases using PURExpress In Vitro 426 Protein Synthesis kit (NEB, Ipswich, MA) following manufacturer's recommendations. 427\nDeamination activity assay on single and double stranded \u03a6X174 DNA substrates 428 To test the activity of in-vitro expressed DNA deaminases, 2 \u03bcL of PURExpress sample was mixed with 429 300 ng of \u03a6X174 Virion DNA (ssDNA substrate, NEB Ipswich MA) or \u03a6X174 RF I DNA (dsDNA substrate, 430 NEB, Ipswich MA) into buffer containing 50 mM Bis-Tris pH 6.0, 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated for 1 h 431 at 37\u00b0C for a total volume of 50 \u03bcL. The deaminated \u03a6X174 DNA was purified using Monarch PCR and 432 DNA Cleanup kit (NEB, Ipswich, MA). DNA concentration was quantified using a NanoDrop 433 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA). 150 ng of deaminated DNAs were 434 digested to nucleosides with the Nucleoside Digestion Mix (NEB, Ipswich, MA) following manufacturer's 435 recommendations. LC-MS/MS analysis was performed by injecting digested DNAs on an Agilent 1290 436 Infinity II UHPLC equipped with a G7117A diode array detector and a 6495C triple quadrupole mass 437 detector operating in the positive electrospray ionization mode (+ESI). UHPLC was carried out on a 438 Waters XSelect HSS T3 XP column (2.1 \u00d7 100 mm, 2.5 \u00b5m) with a gradient mobile phase consisting of 439 methanol and 10 mM aqueous ammonium acetate (pH 4.5). MS data acquisition was performed in the 440 dynamic multiple reaction monitoring (DMRM) mode. Each nucleoside was identified in the extracted 441 chromatogram associated with its specific MS/MS transition: dC [M+H]+ at m/z 228.1\u2192112.1; dU 442 [M+H]+ at m/z 229.1\u2192113.1; dmC [M+H]+ at m/z 242.1\u2192126.1; and dT [M+H]+ at m/z 243.1\u2192127.1. 443 External calibration curves with known amounts of the nucleosides were used to calculate their ratios 444 within the samples analyzed. 445\nDeamination activity assay on single and double-stranded oligonucleotide DNA 446\nsubstrates 447 To test the activity of in vitro expressed DddA and SsdA DNA deaminases on oligonucleotide substrates 448 (Supplementary Table S3), a 2 \u00b5L of PURExpress sample was mixed with 300 ng of 44 bp single-stranded 449 or double-stranded DNA substrates (annealed in 10 mM TRIS ph=8.0) with single cytosine in the contexts 450 TC, AC, CC, and GC in a buffer consisting of 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT for a total 451 volume of 50 \u03bcL. Cytosine deamination to uracil percentage was measured with LC-MS/MS as described 452 above. 453\nSynthesis of 5fC and 5caC modified DNA substrates 454 Oligonucleotides with 5fC and 5caC modified bases were synthesized in-house using standard 455 phosphoramidite chemistry and supplier deprotection protocols (Glen Research, Sterling, VA). Control 456 oligonucleotide (4CpG_contr) was purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT, Coralville, IA). 457\nDeaminase activity assay on 5fC and 5caC modified DNA 458 To test activity on 5fC and 5caC modified DNA, we designed a set of substrates (40 bp) containing 4 459 modified cytosines (Supplementary Table S4). The set of oligonucleotides included preferable 460 deamination sites for 11 DNA deaminases from 5 representative clades. In each reaction, we mixed each 461 modified oligonucleotide (dcaC or dfC) with the control oligonucleotide (C only) in a ratio of 1:1 (800 462 ng+800 ng) to monitor deamination of cytosine to uracil. After incubation for 5 h at 37\u00b0C in - reaction 463 buffer containing 50 mM Bis-Tris pH 6.0, 0.1% Triton X-100 with different DNA deaminases, DNA was 464 purified using Monarch PCR and DNA Cleanup kit, digested to nucleosides with the Nucleoside Digestion 465 Mix (NEB, Ipswich MA) and the reaction products were quantified with LC-MS/MS. 466\nDeamination activity assay on RNA substrate 467 To test the activity of in-vitro expressed deaminases on RNA, 2 \u03bcL of freshly made PURExpress sample 468 was mixed with 200 ng of heavy isotope labeled Fluc mRNA into buffer containing 50 mM Bis-Tris pH 469 6.0, 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C for a total volume of 50 \u03bcL. Then, deaminase 470 treated RNA was purified with NEBNext sample purification beads (E7104S, NEB, Ipswich, MA) using 1.2x 471 beads to sample volume ratio, eluted in 40 \u03bcL nuclease free water. RNA sample was filtrated using a 472 0.22 \u00b5m centrifugal filter (UFC30GV00, MilliporeSigma, Darmstadt, Germany) to ensure all the beads 473 were removed from the sample. Purified and filtrated RNA was then digested to single nucleoside by 474 Nucleoside Digestion Mix (M0649S, NEB, Ipswich, MA). LC-MS/MS analysis was performed by injecting 475 digested stable isotope labeled RNAs on an Agilent 1290 Infinity II UHPLC equipped with a G7117A diode 476 array detector and a 6495C triple quadrupole mass detector operating in the positive electrospray 477 ionization mode (+ESI). UHPLC was carried out on a Waters XSelect HSS T3 XP column (2.1 \u00d7 100 mm, 2.5 478 \u00b5m) with a gradient mobile phase consisting of methanol and 10 mM aqueous ammonium acetate (pH 479 4.5). MS data acquisition was performed in the dynamic multiple reaction monitoring (DMRM) mode. 480 Each nucleoside was identified in the extracted chromatogram associated with its specific MS/MS 481 transition: rC* [M+H]+ at m/z 256.1\u2192119.1; rU* [M+H]+ at m/z 256.1\u2192119.1 (*: Stable isotope labeled 482 nucleosides) External calibration curves with known amounts of the nucleosides were used to calculate 483 their ratios within the samples analyzed. The conversion rate was calculated using the following 484 formula: 485\nlabeled Uridine / (labeled Uridine + labeled C) 486\nDNA deamination NGS assay 487 50 ng of unmodified E. coli C2566 genomic DNA was combined with control DNAs with various DNA 488 modification types (Supplementary Table S5) in 50 \u00b5L of 10 mM Tris pH 8.0. 489\nThen the DNA was transferred to a Covaris microTUBE (Covaris, Woburn, MA) and sheared to 300 bp 490 using the Covaris S2 instrument. 50 \u00b5L of sheared material was transferred to a PCR strip tube to begin 491 library construction. NEBNext DNA Ultra II Reagents (NEB, Ipswich, MA) were used according to the 492 manufacturer\u2019s instructions for end repair, A-tailing, and adaptor ligation. The custom made Pyrollo-dC 493 adaptor (NEB Organic Synthesis Division, Ipswich MA), where all dCs are replaced with Pyrollo-dC, was 494\nused: (ACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATC*T and 495 [Phos]GATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA). The ligated samples were mixed with 110 \u00b5L of 496 resuspended NEBNext Sample Purification Beads and cleaned up according to the manufacturer\u2019s 497 instructions. The library was eluted in 17 \u00b5L of water. For ssDNA libraries, prior to deamination the DNA 498 was denatured by heating at 90oC for 10 minutes followed by cooling for 2 minutes on ice. The DNA was 499 then deaminated in 50 mM Bis-Tris pH 6.0, 0.1% Triton X-100, using 1 \u00b5L of dsDNA deaminase 500 synthesized as described above with an incubation time of 1 hour at 37oC. After deamination reaction, 1 501 \u00b5L of Thermolabile Proteinase K (NEB, Ipswich, MA) was added and incubated additional 30 min at 37oC 502 followed by 10 min at 60oC. 5\u00b5M of NEBNext Unique Dual Index Primers and 25 \u00b5L NEBNext Q5U Master 503 Mix (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) were added to the DNA and PCR amplified. The PCR 504 reaction samples were mixed with 50 \u00b5L of resuspended NEBNext Sample Purification Beads and 505 cleaned up according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The library was eluted in 15 \u00b5L of water. The 506 libraries were analyzed and quantified by High sensitivity DNA analysis using a chip inserted into an 507 Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100. The libraries were sequenced using the Illumina NextSeq and NovaSeq 508 platforms. Paired-end sequencing of 150 cycles (2 x 75 bp) was performed for all the sequencing runs. 509 Base calling and demultiplexing were carried out with the standard Illumina pipeline. 510\nMeasure deaminase activity on N4mC 511 Deaminase activity on N4mC was measured from all the cacCgc sites in the genome of pRSSM1.PleII 512 plasmid, of which the capitalized C is N4 methylated. To avoid the confounding effect of sequence 513 selectivity, we only considered enzymes that have a minimum 10% activity on unmodified cacCgc sites in 514 the E. coli DNA and calculated a relative deamination efficiency value, which is the percentage of one 515 enzyme\u2019s activity on N4mC compared to that on unmodified C in the same sequence context. 516\nSEM-seq library preparation of human genomic DNA 517 50 ng of human GM12878 genomic DNA spiked with 0.15 ng CpG-methylated pUC19, 1 ng unmethylated 518 lambda DNA and 1 ng methylated XP12 DNA were sonicated with the Covaris S2 instrument, end 519 repaired and ligated to the Pyrollo-dC adaptor as described above. The deamination of the resulting 520 ligation product was performed with 1 \u00b5L of dsDNA deaminase (MsddA) in Low pH buffer (50 mM Bis-521 Tris pH 6.0, 0.1% Triton X-100) with the addition of 50mM NaCl and 1mM DTT in 20 \u00b5L total reaction 522\nvolume for 3 h at 37 C. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 \u00b5L of Thermolabile Proteinase K (NEB, 523\nIpswich, MA) and incubating for 30 min at 37C then an additional 10 min at 60C. 15 \u00b5L of reaction 524 without purification was directly used for PCR amplification (6 cycles) in 50 \u00b5L total volume and cleaned 525 up as mentioned above. The whole genome libraries were sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 526 platform (100 bp paired-end). 527\nLow input SEM-seq libraries 528 50 ng of human GM12878 genomic DNA spiked with 0.15 ng CpG-methylated pUC19, 1 ng unmethylated 529 lambda DNA and 1 ng methylated XP12 DNA were sonicated with the Covaris S2 instrument. Sheared 530 DNA was diluted to a concentration of 0.2 pg/\u00b5L, from which 50 \u00b5L (10 pg) of were used for end repair 531 and adaptor ligation as described above. For adaptor ligation Pyrollo-dC adaptor was diluted 25 times. 532 The deamination of the resulting ligation product was performed with 1 \u00b5L of dsDNA deaminase 533 (MsddA) in Low pH buffer (50 mM Bis-Tris pH 6.0, 0.1% Triton X-100) with the addition 15 ng of Lambda 534 DNA (Promega, Fitchburg, WI) in 20 \u00b5L total reaction volume for 3 h at 37 C. The reaction was stopped 535\nby adding 1 \u00b5L of Thermolabile Proteinase K (NEB, Ipswich, MA) and incubating for 30 min at 37C then 536\nan additional 10 min at 60C. 15 \u00b5L of reaction without purification was directly used for PCR 537 amplification (12 and 14 cycles) in 50 \u00b5L total volume and cleaned up as mentioned above two times. 538 The whole genome libraries were sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform (100 bp paired-539 end). 540 541\nData analysis 542\nRead processing and mapping 543 Raw Illumina reads were first trimmed by the Trim Galore software 544 (https://github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore) to remove adapter sequences and low-quality bases from 545 the 3\u2019 end. Unpaired reads due to adapter/quality trimming were also removed during this process. The 546 trimmed read sequences were C to T converted and were then mapped to the corresponding reference 547 using the Bismark program44 with the default Bowtie2 settings45. For the NGS deamination assay, a 548 composite reference was created by combining the complete genome sequences of E. coli C2566, phage 549 lambda, phage XP12, phage T4, plasmid pRRSlac, and Adenovirus. For human libraries made by SEM-seq, 550 EM-seq and WGBS, a composite reference included the human genome (GRCh38) and the complete 551 sequences of unmethylated lambda and CpG-methylated pUC19 controls. 552\nThe first 5 bp at the 5\u2019 end of R2 reads were removed to reduce end-repair errors and aligned read pairs 553 that shared the same alignment ends were regarded as PCR duplicates and were discarded. For human 554 libraries, aligned reads that contained excessive cytosines in non-CpG context (more than 4 in 100bp) 555 were removed before calculating methylation level for individual sites because these reads likely contain 556 high conversion errors. 557\nThe numbers of Ts (converted not methylated) and Cs (unconverted modified) of each covered cytosine 558 position were then calculated from the remaining good quality alignments using Bismark methylation 559 extractor. 560\nAnalysis of deamination efficiency and sequence preference from the NGS data 561 Deamination events were inferred from C to T changes at each covered cytosine position in the 562 genomes based on Bismark methylation extractor output. The 20 bp flanking sequences (10 bp 563 upstream and 10 bp downstream) were extracted from all the covered cytosines that had at least 10X 564 read coverage from the individual genomes and divided the cytosines sites into different groups based 565 on their deamination rates (e.g., >=90%, >=50%). Flanking sequences of each cytosine group were used 566 to make sequence logo using WebLogo 322 to infer deamination sequence preference. 567\nDetermination of methylated CpG sites in human genome by Binomial correction 568 For all samples except the 10 pg SEM-seq libraries, to avoid false identification of methylated positions 569 due to the incomplete conversion of unmodified cytosines, we used Binomial statistics with Benjamini-570 Hochberg correction to determine the methylated CpG sites that have significantly higher methylation 571 levels compared with the background. The P-value of the one-sided binomial test (\ud835\udc3b0: \ud835\udc43 \u2264 \ud835\udc430, \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc4e: \ud835\udc43 >572 \ud835\udc430) can be calculated as \ud835\udc43 = 1 \u2212 \ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc58; \ud835\udc5b, \ud835\udc430), where \ud835\udc39 is the cumulative distribution function of the 573 binomial distribution, \ud835\udc58 is the number of unmethylated cytosine, \ud835\udc5b is the coverage (number of 574 methylated and unmethylated cytosine), \ud835\udc43 is the sample methylation level for each region, and \ud835\udc430 is the 575 background methylation level which is the non-conversion rate estimated from unmethylated lambda 576 genome. The P-value was further adjusted using Benjamini-Hochberg method. Only the CpG positions 577 with coverage above a certain cutoff and FDR (false discovery rate) < 0.05 were defined as methylated 578\nCpG sites. For a single replicate and replicates combined data, we require a minimum of 3X and 5X 579 coverage, respectively. 580 581\nGenome-wide coverage analysis 582 We combined the filtered bam files from the two technical replicates to investigate the sequencing 583 coverage across the genome. The GC content bias statistics were calculated using Picard (version 584 2.26.11) CollectGcBiasMetrics (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard) and was plotted using a custom 585 python script. 586\nDetermination of coverage around CpG islands and transcription start sites (TSS) 587 We combined the filtered bam files from the two technical replicates to examine the sequencing 588 coverage of different methods around the CpG islands and transcription start sites. The reference bed 589 files of human CpG islands and TSS were downloaded from UCSC Table Browser46. and The coverage 590 was computed using bamCoverage from deepTools (version 3.3.1)47 with the following parameters: --591 binSize 50 --normalizeUsing RPGC --effectiveGenomeSize 2913022398 \u2013ignoreDuplicates. Then the 592 coverage was calculated for per genome regions using computeMatrix from deepTools with -a 1000 -b 593 1000; and scale-regions and reference-point option were used for CpG islands and TSS, respectively. 594\nDetermination of methylation status of CpG sites at epigenomic regions 595 We studied the methylation status of defined CpG sites at key epigenetic regions. We used GM12878 596 ChIP-seq data sets (processed hg38 bed narrowPeak files) from ENCODE portal23: ENCFF023LTU 597 (H3K27ac), ENCFF188SZS (H3K4me3), and ENCFF796WRU (CTCF). The methylation of CpG sites around 598 these epigenetic regions was calculated using computeMatrix reference-point from deepTools with the 599 following parameters: -a 1000 -b 1000 --skipZeros --referencePoint center. 600\nSupplementary information 601 Supplementary Table 1: Supplementary_Table_1.xlsx 602\nSupplementary Figures 1-16, and Supplementary tables S2-S6: Supplementary_Figures_and_tables.pdf 603\nData Availability 604 NGS substrate specificity libraries and SEM-seq libraries are available at NCBI GEO accession: GSE233932 605\nAcknowledgements 606 We thank Yan-Jiun Lee and Peter Weigele for providing XP12 phage DNA, Dr. Lidija Truncaite, Vilnius 607 University Life Sciences Center, Vilnius Lithuania for fully C-hydroxymethylated T4147 and fully C-608 hydroxy-methyl-beta-glucosylated T4 alpha-glucosyl-transferase knockout (AGT-) genomic DNAs, Dr. 609 Chen Song for cfDNA. pRSSM1.PleII plasmid (containing N4mC at cacCgc sites was obtained from Dr. Iain 610 Murray and Richard J.
