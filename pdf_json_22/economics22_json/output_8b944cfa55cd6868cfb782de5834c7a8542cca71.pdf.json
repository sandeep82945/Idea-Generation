    "abstractText": "Understanding the processes of residential solar PV uptake is critical to developing planning and policy energy transition pathways. This paper outlines a novel hybrid Agent-Based-Modelling/statistical adoption prediction framework that addresses several drawbacks in current modelling approaches. Specifically, we extend the capabilities of similar previous models and incorporate empirical data, behavioural theory, social networks and explicitly considers the spatial context. We provide empirical data affecting households\u2019 propensity to adopt, including perceptions of solar PV systems, the role of tenure and urban location. We demonstrate the approach in the context of Melbourne metropolitan region, Australia; and draw on housing approval data to demonstrate the role of housing construction in accelerating adoption. Finally, we explore the approach\u2019s validity against real-world data with promising results that also indicate key areas for further research and improvement.",

It is largely known how to deal with such issues, but this will require timely investments and planning. Therefore, it is important that planners and decision-makers have the best available data, models, and projections to analyse likely uptake rates and requirements for infrastructure investments that result from future developments and responses to policy and planning initiatives. This sentiment is reinforced by Alipour and colleagues who note that efforts \u201cthat exploit accurate empirical and demographic data to underpin robust methods and models will help improve policy analysis and decision-making and accelerate the rate of appropriately located household PV adoption\u201d (Alipour et al. 2021, p.487).\n1.3 To understand the processes that drive the adoption of residential solar PV systems, a variety of methodologies have been used, many of which are already present in the literature. Examples include Machine Learning drawing on artificial neural networks (Bhavsar & Pitchumani 2021; Parsad et al. 2020); Agent-Based Modelling (ABM)\nJASSS, 25(4) 2, 2022 http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/25/4/2.html Doi: 10.18564/jasss.4921\n(Palmer et al. 2015; Rai & Robinson 2015; Zhang et al. 2016; Zhao et al. 2011); systems dynamics modelling (Hsu 2012); logistic regression (Gupta et al. 2020); time-series modelling (Currie et al. 2019); and structural equations modelling (Kumar et al. 2020). In this article, we present a hybrid approach drawing both on statistical methods as well as ABM."

            "heading": "Why a hybrid approach?",
            "text": "1.4 Zhang & Vorobeychik (2019) critically explores the empirical foundation of ABMs that describe innovation diffusion processes, and conclude that statistical methods (or Machine Learning) can be naturally embedded into innovation diffusion ABMs to improve their empirical foundations, whilst maintaining the benefits of ABM.\n1.5 Similarly, to make sense of the diversity of methods for predicting solar PV adoption behaviours, Alipour et al. (2021) systematic review of approaches categorised approaches into statistical and non-statistical approaches. They concluded that in a predictive capacity sense, statistical methods tend to be more reliable than modelling approaches (i.e., ABM). However, this is largely due to limited theoretical or empirical basis for many ABMs, rather than a limitation in the approach itself (Alipour et al. 2021).\n1.6 Alipour et al. (2021) also note several common modelling concerns and knowledge gaps in the literature. Firstly, many models were based on only limited statistical samples and this puts in question the validity and reliability of the results. Secondly, whilst being central for shaping solar PV uptake behaviour, psychological parameters are often lacking both in literature, as well as in inputs into both statistical approaches and models. Thirdly, many reported models are also found to be based on an insufficient exploration of validity. Fourthly, and importantly, many approaches rely on a single theoretical model of behaviour, and by doing so limited themselves to not consider any other potentially important factors.\n1.7 Finally, Alipour et al. (2020) and Alipour et al. (2021) found that only 8% of reviewed ABMs are 1) empiricallybased, 2) draw on behavioural theory and 3) are spatially sensitive; and they describe this combination of attributes to reflect a desired level of sophistication. The most sophisticated models included all these features.\n1.8 To address concerns about ABMs that describe solar PV system adoption and provide more accurate prediction at a both a micro and macro level, this article describes the development of an Agent-Based Model that expands on the capabilities of logistic regression modelling and allows for calibration of additional parameters. The ABM framework\u2019s future-looking capability is particularly well-suited to scenario exploration (Alipour et al. 2021; Moglia et al. 2017). This feature of ABM is therefore also critical to enabling more agile policy making (Moglia et al. 2017).\n1.9 We have found only two examples in literature of what are formally described as hybrid statistical/ABM models describing the adoption of solar PVs (Lee & Hong 2019; Zhao et al. 2011). Zhao et al. (2011) incorporate financial payback calculations, but otherwise lacks an extensive empirical foundation or consideration of behavioural theory. Lee & Hong (2019) developed behavioural rules based on logistic regression, and integrated the modelling with a Geographical Information System, to help simulate market diffusion of solar PV systems in Korea. However, they do not consider beliefs, the role of housing construction, and local constraints such as those associated with building regulations.\n1.10 We also note that other examples exist that adopts a mix of statistical methods and ABMs to predict solar PV adoption, even if those are not described as hybrid models. For example, Zhang et al. (2016) describe a mixed model that incorporates aspects of the local context (tenure, access to a pool, size of home, etc), combined with agent decision-making that describes financial choices. While important steps forward, price elasticities are theoretically based, rather than empirically based; especially in relation to the capacity to pay any upfront cost, and only considers a subset of the contextual micro-level factors that are relevant.\n1.11 Rai & Robinson (2015) utilise a longitudinal survey of solar PV adopters and draw on agent-behaviour (using the Theory of Planned Behaviour) and statistical analysis for estimating model parameters. Their model achieves relatively high level of predictive capacity, but only considers very few contextual household parameters like tenure, dwelling type, economic circumstances, and so on."

However, our model has a more extensive empirical basis. It considers environmental attitudes, peer-effects via social networks, variability in financial capacity, local building constraints,\nJASSS, 25(4) 2, 2022 http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/25/4/2.html Doi: 10.18564/jasss.4921\nand the role of housing construction. This is a hybrid approach that draws heavily on empirical data/analysis, behavioural theory and explicitly considers the spatial context of solar PV adoption in Melbourne metropolitan region, Australia. As such, our study contributes to the emerging knowledge of hybrid ABM approaches and how to construct them in the context of solar PV adoption modelling. Specifically, we provide methodological contributions through:\n\u2022 An example of a more comprehensive hybrid model of solar PV adoption behaviour in addition to the small number previously available. This is a step forward because it allows for more empirically robust modelling platforms that have the flexibility of the ABM frameworks.\n\u2022 Illustrating how different data sets can be integrated in a way that combines the rigor of statistical methods, with the complexity and flexibility that can be leveraged using ABM. Specifically, we have demonstrated how macro-level adoption data and housing construction data can be integrated into the modelling process.\n\u2022 Exploring calibration and validation methods for such a method.\n\u2022 Exploring one of the most comprehensive lists of factors that predict solar PV adoption behaviour of any similar study.\n1.13 We also make key knowledge contributions to the understanding of solar PV adoption processes, with insights for Melbourne metropolitan region, but likely of wider application. Specifically, we make the following substantive contributions i.e., we demonstrate the:\n\u2022 Important role of the properties of the home, tenure and construction of new homes in the adoption behaviours. In other words, the housing context influences decisions both in terms of access to space for installation, local building regulations, heritage overlays and whether someone is renting or not. It is also the case, clearly demonstrated in this paper, that those that are building new homes often take the opportunity to install solar PV systems at the same time or at least in the year after. This has not previously been demonstrated in a comprehensive manner.\n\u2022 Role of perceptions of solar PVs in the context of a highly contested socio-political environment. This shows a somewhat counter-intuitive result in that both negative and positive perceptions about solar PVs can occur in the same individual, and that both perceptions have a statistically significant impact on the likelihood of purchasing a solar PV system.\n\u2022 Finding that adoption is likely to keep accelerating in Melbourne metropolitan region, even if there are structural barriers, for example linked with high rates of renting, and areas with low rates of new home construction and restrictions on installations associated with building regulations.\n\u2022 Current perceptions and level of adoption of solar PVs in the Melbourne metropolitan region context, one of the locations with the highest rates of residential solar PV adoption in the world.\n1.14 Finally, whilst our approach, and associated empirical analysis, applies to the context of the case study; the methods should be replicable and repeated in new contexts. There may be some upfront effort required i.e., to collect survey data combined with calibration and evaluation of validity."

Such issues can be managed through infrastructure investments in large-scale batteries, grid interconnections, and complementary electricity generation (Webb et al. 2020) but this requires insights as to when and where new renewable electricity generation capacity will become available. Therefore, for improved electric utility planning and operation, there is a need to develop predictive modelling tools for renewable energy system outputs (Sweeney et al. 2020), and the adoption of renewable energy systems such as residential solar systems (Bhavsar & Pitchumani 2021). Such tools will help reduce the uncertainty in decision making by better understanding uptake rates of residential solar PV systems, and therefore the need for investments in transmission and storage capacity, as well as the need for alternative electricity generation. This will provide cost savings by avoiding alternative and costly risk mitigation strategies, as well as reducing the risk of stranded infrastructure assets."

We used quotas on education, gender and age to replicate distributions like those in the Australian Bureau of Statistics census (Australian Bureau of Statistics 2016). Participants that passed quota limitations and geographical and age-based screening were recruited from an online panel. The survey questions are available in the appendix. The size of the sample was 1,042 with all respondents residing in the Melbourne Metropolitan Region. The survey explored 132 questions. The average completion rate amongst participants was 64% and the average time spent on the survey was 13 minutes. The survey was consistent with CSIRO\u2019s Ethical Conduct in Human Research Policy and received ethics clearance (#081/19).\n3.9 In the sample, 23% of respondents reported owning a solar PV system, and a further 15% noted an intention to purchase in the next 6 months, with 63% noting that they neither own nor intend to purchase such a system. In comparison, at the time of the survey, only 14% of households across Melbourne metropolitan region owned solar PV systems, indicating a selection bias towards those with solar PV systems.\n3.10 Acknowledging that the sample is biased towards those more likely to adopt solar PV systems, we adjust for this in the model, both by adopting weighted estimates, adjustment factors (see Section 4.1 on the calibration), as well as through the way that agents are initialised to represent known distributions of socio-economic attributes.\n3.11 There were 48% male and 51% female respondents, with 1% either no response or other gender. 9% of respondents were in the age group 18-24, 20% were 25-34, 18% were 35-44, 17% were 45-54, 15% were 55-64, 12% were 65-74 and 8% were 75 and older. This shows an acceptable distribution of gender and age groups.\n3.12 We note some sampling bias towards higher education i.e., 12% had a postgraduate qualification, 24% had an undergraduate degree (compared with 22% of the general population who have an undergraduate or postgraduate degree) but only 0.5% of the respondents had primary school education as their highest level of attainment (compared with 9% in the general population). For estimates of propensities in the general population, the 2016 census is referred to Australian Bureau of Statistics (2016).\n3.13 Apart from the survey data, we also use census data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (Australian Bureau of Statistics 2016); spatially (per postcode) and temporally (per month) granular adoption data from the Clean Energy Regulator (Clean Energy Regulator 2020); as well as data on building approvals from local councils (.idcommunity 2020)."

In other words, we found that someone who thinks that solar PV systems are mainly about showing off is also more likely to think that they are ugly. Therefore, we created latent constructs that are more suitable for use in regression modelling, and identified three variables:\n\u2022 Solar PV systems are good: explained by variables indicated by # in Table 2;\n\u2022 Solar PV systems are bad: explained by variables indicated by \u2227 in Table 2;\n\u2022 Solar PV systems are inappropriate where I live: explained by variables indicated by & in Table 2.\n3.16 Interestingly, we identified these three beliefs based on Factor Analysis where positive and negative beliefs seemingly should be two sides of a spectrum, but we found they are not. In fact, the belief that solar PVs are good (a construct of several beliefs), and the belief that solar PVs are bad (a construct of another set of beliefs) are uncorrelated. In other words, the same person could simultaneously hold beliefs that solar PVs are good, and that solar PVs are bad.\nJASSS, 25(4) 2, 2022 http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/25/4/2.html Doi: 10.18564/jasss.4921\n3.17 These beliefs do influence the decision to adopt solar PV systems. Among the participants who had on balance a more positive view of solar PV systems, 25% had already adopted these systems. Among those who were on balance neutral, 20% were adopters. Among those with a negative view of solar PV systems, only 5% reported ownership.\n3.18 Furthermore, dwelling type influences whether respondents report that there is space for solar PV systems at their property (house: 80%, detached dwelling: 61%, other: 73%, apartment: 31%). Rates of solar PV ownership for those with self-reported space for a system is 30%, compared to 9% for those who report that they do not have space (presumably for an additional system).

The survey data, as well as the logit model was embedded into a hybrid ABM. This hybrid model is similar to that which was previously described by Lee & Hong (2019) in that the core engine is a Logit model, around which a micro-simulation model has been wrapped, allowing for describing the heterogeneity of the population as well as the influence of the key opportunity for solar PV installation associated with new construction of a house as well as the peer-influence on decisions. We describe the model using a commonly used protocol for describing ABMs, the Overview, Design concepts and Details protocol (Grimm et al. 2010), with descriptions provided in Appendix A. Calibrated model parameters are shown in Table 5, Table 6 and Figure 3.\n3.23 Social network: As there is no social network data available, households are connected in a social network according to a theoretically constructed Barabasi-Albert graph (a scale-free network). This is an algorithm that generates a random scale-free networks using a preferential attachment mechanism, which has been sometimes considered when developing ABMs (Sabzian et al. 2020; Sznajd-Weron et al. 2014; Wang & Collins 2015). Further description of the social network type is provided by Barab\u00e1si & Albert (1999).\n3.24 Scale: The model is being applied at numerous local government areas within which synthetic populations are generated based on existing demographic data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics and local government resources (.idcommunity 2020; Australian Bureau of Statistics 2016).\n3.25 Initialisation: Households are generated at the start of the simulation period representing the known population size, and number of households at that time. The representativeness of attribute assignment similar to that used by Moglia et al. (2017) where assignment is based on individual responses. Representativeness therefore relies on having enough responses (approximately >30) in each combination of key attributes, which we do. To represent housing growth i.e., construction, new households are generated in each yearly timestep, based on building approval data.\nJASSS, 25(4) 2, 2022 http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/25/4/2.html Doi: 10.18564/jasss.4921\n3.26 Heterogeneity: All household attributes are assigned so that distributions, correlations and conditional probabilities are consistent both with the household survey as well attribute distributions as per the Australian Bureau of Statistics community profiles for each local government area based on the 2016 census data (Australian Bureau of Statistics 2016) and community profiles from the profileid website (.idcommunity 2020).\n3.27 Simulation process: the process overview and schedule are illustrated in the diagram in Figure 4 showing the sequence of steps in the simulation. The simulation process is also described in pseudo-code in Algorithm 1. From a household perspective, the adoption of solar PVs is a two-step process, i.e. first the household needs to reach a decision point where the chance of adoption is based on household attributes etc, and the second, the outcome of that decision is to adopt solar PVs (with the probability of this decision described by Equation 2). Within the simulation schedule, the household adoption probability is calculated using these equations and parameter values in Table 5:\nP (Yi,j,k = 1|Yi,j\u22121,k = 0) = \u03c9\u03b4t\u03b3i\u03b8k,t\u00b5k,jrj\n1 + exp(\u03b20 + \u03b21x1 + \u03b22x2 + . . . \u03b2nxn) (2)\n\u00b5k,t = 1 + \u00b50Yk,t (3)\nE(Yi,j,k) = \u03b4t\u03b3i\u03b8k,t\u00b5k,t\n1 + exp(\u03b20 + \u03b21x1 + \u03b22x2 + . . . \u03b2nxn) j\u2211 t=2007 (1 + \u00b50Yk,t)P (Yi,t\u22121,k = 0) (4)\n3.28 Here,YI,j,k is the stochastic variable describing whether agent k, within LGA I and in year j, have adopted solar PVs. \u03b2 model parameters are described in Table 5. Importantly, each household has a probability of \u201cmaking a choice\u201d each time step (2.3% chance each month as per Table 5) \u2013 whilst those that build a new home definitely (100%) make a choice. At this time, once making a choice whether to install solar PVs, the probability of choosing to install is described by Equation 2. \u03c9 is a generic adjustment effect that is calibrated. \u03b4t is the year-effect factor describing the different policy settings and temporal contexts for each year, \u03b3i is a spatial effect describing the differences between local government areas (LGAs) not otherwise explained in the demographics and housing stock. \u00b5k,j is the new dwelling effect for agent k in year j. rj is the rebate factor applied in year 2019, and in 2020. The new dwelling effect is one except in the year that a building is being constructed. Equation 4 shows the statistical expectation value for the variable Y .\n3.29 Contagion effect: The contagion effect \u00b5k,j is calculated using Equation 3, where Yk,t is the average adoption rate of solar PV systems within the connected nodes in the householdk\u2019s social network at year t. As per Kiesling et al.

The overall predictive accuracy of Equation 1 is 79%, although non-adoption is predicted more accurately than adoption. This issue is unsurprising because other determinants trigger a household\u2019s choice to install solar PVs beyond, such as opportunity, practice, social influence and contextual or emotional factors present at a moment in time, but which are difficult to capture in a survey. It should be noted that the intention is not to accurately predict individual behaviour, but instead to estimate aggregate behaviours which the model does well.\n4.10 Based on Table 7, we can calculate the: \u2022 Accuracy \u2013 percentage of predictions that are accurate: 79%\n\u2022 Precision \u2013 ability to accurately predict adoption: 60%\n\u2022 Sensitivity \u2013 proportion of adopters correctly predicted: 26%\n4.11 In other words, a relatively high accuracy, but a relatively lower sensitivity.

To evaluate the macro-level predictive capacity, we calculate the R-Squared (as traditionally defined: 1 minus the unexplained variance divided by the total variance) for each of the LGAs and each of the years. The total variance is the statistical variance of all observations, while the unexplained variance is the statistical variance of the errors. The R-Squared results are shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6, representing the results from the full calibration period. Spatially, the R-Squared ranges from 0.62-0.97 with only Glen Eira and Moreland having values below 0.85. Temporally, the predictive capacity ranges from 0.40-0.96. For the validation year in 2020 (i.e., the forward data), the R-Squared was first 0.66, indicating a reasonable goodness-of-fit which can nonetheless be improved. After deliberation, it was deemed that the major difficulty was the introduction of a new rebate for households with certain eligibility criteria that limited uptake. After calibrating a rebate effect (see Calibration Section, 4.1) the R-Squared was 0.86. Although there is variation spatially and temporally in predictive capacity, the aggregate predictive capacity is relatively high across either dimension. Unfortunately, similar models are not reporting R-Squared (which we think is the appropriate measure here) for their approaches, so it is difficult to compare (Lee & Hong 2019; Zhao et al. 2011).\nJASSS, 25(4) 2, 2022 http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/25/4/2.html Doi: 10.18564/jasss.4921"

For example, in outer suburban areas there can be relatively lower adoption due to extensive industrial or parkland areas, or university precincts. In more densely built-up areas or areas with larger proportions of rental properties, property rights dimensions (such as body corporate restrictions, air-rights, common space, ownership of usable surfaces) as well as coordination barriers (i.e., decisions may need coordination of multiple users and owners to maximise efficiency of microgrids rather than individual rooftop solar PV systems) may inhibit the uptake of rooftop solar PV systems.\nHousing construction as a catalyst of solar PV adoption\n5.13 A key finding in this article is how construction of new housing, at the very least in the context of Melbourne metropolitan region, is a key driver of solar PV adoption. To show this effect, we have drawn on building approval data and this contributes significantly to the accuracy of predictions. Alipour et al. (2021) noted that this type of data, on construction, was previously only incorporated in one other study on this topic, and never within a comprehensive framework such as the one described here.\n5.14 In this article, we have described the adoption of solar PVs on newly constructed homes in a relatively crude way based on: 1) the notion that construction triggers a decision whether to install solar PVs, due to the opportunity that has arisen, and 2) that the likelihood of adoption is a factor\u00b5k,j (here calibrated to 5.74) larger than in other circumstances for the same household. With the available data, only such a relatively crude model is feasible, which is to some extent regrettable.\n5.15 This lack of appropriate data that connects solar PV adoption with new home construction shows a key knowledge gap. Importantly, when we designed the survey, the role of construction was not considered. This is because the role of housing construction in driving solar PV adoption was not widely acknowledged in literature (if at all), and that we only learnt about this effect after interrogation and validating the model, which led us to make adjustments, which was also confirmed by solar PV experts that we conferred with about this result. In other words, we propose that further research undertaken so that:\n\u2022 Data is collected specifically on solar PV adoption for new homes. Experts argue that there is a window of about 2 years after construction when there is an increased chance of adoption. Either because of the opportunities associated with construction, and secondly as experts report that households commonly find the energy efficiency of the new home to be lacking, and therefore commonly opt for installing solar PVs to compensate.\n\u2022 Data is collected to better understand the socio-psychological and economic drivers for adoption of those who build new homes, or that retrofit existing homes.\nData improvement for energy transition\n5.16 The 79% accuracy of the predictions of ownership or intentions at an individual level could be improved. This indicates opportunities for gathering further data, and based on our analysis, there are areas of interests, specifically:\n\u2022 Whether residents are living in recently constructed housing,\n\u2022 Peer-influence,\n\u2022 Awareness and access amongst participants relating to financial incentives, and\n\u2022 Whether participants have been contacted by solar PV sales companies.\n5.17 We also know that visual cues play a role in influencing adoption in some contexts (Bollinger & Gillingham 2012; Copiello 2018; Parkins et al. 2018). We propose that research is undertaken in Australia to confirm and quantify this effect, as well as to further build this into the quantitative approach.\n5.18 Finally, there is an opportunity for more comprehensive modelling of the actor ecosystem. This more comprehensive approach for exploring the complexities of the residential Solar PV market in Australia could be enabled by incorporating the ecosystem of actors, providing a more integrated exploration of policies and interventions; for example, similar to that done by Moglia et al. (2018) when exploring residential energy-efficiency.\nJASSS, 25(4) 2, 2022 http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/25/4/2.html Doi: 10.18564/jasss.4921"

Firstly, we imagine that this model could be usefully employed by electricity network planners, to inform infrastructure investment decisions. Secondly, we imagine that this model could be usefully employed by planners in government departments, whose job it is to fine-tune policies and regulations to boost the adoption rates of solar PV systems in a fair, equitable and cost-effective manner.\n5.20 Therefore, our approach has been informed by discussions by energy distribution companies who require better predictive capacity for solar PV adoption, so that they can plan to have the required infrastructure. Among other things, this has informed our choice of spatial granularity (local government areas i.e., LGAs)."

            "heading": "Conclusions",
            "text": "6.1 This paper reports on the development of a hybrid model to improve modelling and policy analysis for solar PV uptake. The modelling results show that high rates of adoption will likely accelerate into future years, but also that structural barriers can vary across the cities.\n6.2 Methodologically, our study contributes to an emerging understanding of so-called hybrid approaches that integrate statistical methods within an ABM simulation framework. This combines the flexibility and exploratory capabilities of ABM with the empirical rigor of statistical methods. Our approach, as one instance of a hybrid approach, is shown to provide relatively accurate predictions at an aggregate level, but with clear directions of opportunities for improvements. The model also shows promising predictive capacity at a micro-level.\n6.3 Methodologically, the hybrid approach provides a series of analytical advantages. First, greater flexibility for policy analysis. There is very considerable opportunity in an ABM to specify hypothetical scenarios without having to formulate such scenarios in terms of exact equations. Second, opportunity for calibration of parameters where appropriate statistical data is unavailable. In this article, we have included the proposed impacts of peer influence and construction of housing, even when statistical data is missing. Third, population heterogeneity. This allows for a richer understanding of how individual agents interact with each other and their environment. Fourth, model extensions are relatively straightforward, even when such extensions include nonlinear and complex interactions. Extendibility is important because these types of models have the capacity act as knowledge representations, or knowledge artefacts that support ongoing learning.\n6.4 In terms of the substantive contribution about modelling the adoption of residential solar PVs, the choice of predictors and collection of data on those predictors is the most important step for improving the accuracy of predictions. Despite reviewing a large body of literature on factors that influence solar PV adoption behaviour, and collecting data on those factors, we still seem to have missed some of the factors that focus on housing construction and peer influence. In fact, there seems to be no solar PV adoption model in existence that uses the full and comprehensive list of predictive factors. Our study represents one of the most comprehensive models in this respect.\n6.5 We also note that to maximise predictive capacity unfortunately requires surveys of the community which comes at a cost. Modelling without such surveys may still provide somewhat accurate results, especially when it is possible to draw on accurate census data, solar PV adoption data and housing construction data. The most important dataset for enabling the hybrid approach is the solar PV adoption data provided by public agencies. This data proved very useful as it allows for calibration of model parameters. This data would be even more useful if there was a further breakdown of the characteristics of adopters, for example providing demographic or socio-economic data. We also note the role of policy settings, especially around financial incentives and this remains a topic that needs further exploration, although a key barrier in the current settings in Melbourne seems to relate to income and property value tests that exclude part of the population from access to rebates.\n6.6 Furthermore, as perhaps the first study to do so, we have been able to demonstrate the role of housing construction in these adoption processes. Specifically, we have shown that, at the very least in the Melbourne context, housing construction is a critical mechanism by which uptake is accelerated, and conversely, we have identified that high rates of renting, and apartment living, or high rates of housing where local building regulations make adoption difficult, leads to significantly slower adoption. This shows the need for financial innovation and/or policy innovations and interventions that help overcome such barriers, as this would help to improve sustainability and equity outcomes.\n6.7 As a next step, because we have embedded our modelling into an ABM framework, it is also possible/recommended to further explore the impact of more complex interventions in the market, for example, innovations that support renters or apartment dwellers to more easily adopt solar PV systems, or to provide more targeted interventions for those constructing new homes.\nJASSS, 25(4) 2, 2022 http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/25/4/2.html Doi: 10.18564/jasss.4921\n6.8 In summary, the comprehensiveness, design and details of this framework combined with a hybrid approach makes it a novel and useful contribution that can inform policy analysis as well as infrastructure planning decisions and support the transition towards greater uptake of renewable energy."
