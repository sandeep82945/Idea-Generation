    "abstractText": "Fibrinolytic enzymes are the most effective agents for the treatment of thrombotic diseases. In the present study, we purified and characterized an extracellular fibrinolytic serine metalloprotease (named Velefibrinase) that is produced by marine Bacillus velezensis Z01 and assessed its thrombolysis in vivo. SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF-MS analyses showed that the molecular mass of Velefibrinase was 32.3 KDa and belonged to the peptidase S8 family. The optimal fibrinolytic activity conditions of Velefibrinase were 40 \u25e6C and pH 7.0. Moreover, Velefibrinase exhibited high substrate specificity to fibrin, and a higher ratio of fibrinolytic/caseinolytic (1.48) values, which indicated that Velefibrinase had excellent fibrinolytic properties. Based on the degradation pattern of fibrin and fibrinogen, Velefibrinase could be classified as \u03b1/\u03b2-fibrinogenase. In vitro, Velefibrinase demonstrated efficient thrombolytic ability, anti-platelet aggregation, and amelioration of blood coagulation (APTT, PT, TT, and FIB), which were superior to those of commercial anticoagulant urokinase. Velefibrinase showed no hemolysis for erythrocyte in vitro and no hemorrhagic activity in vivo. Finally, Velefibrinase effectively prevented mouse tail thrombosis in a dose-dependent (0.22\u20130.88 mg/kg) manner. These findings suggested that Velefibrinase has the potential to becoming a new thrombolytic agent.",

            "text": "The accumulation of insoluble fibrin in a blood vessel usually leads to thrombosis, which further result in thrombotic diseases (TDs), such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and venous thromboembolism [1]. TDs account for approximately 31% of all worldwide deaths and are rapidly increasing in developing countries [2]. The imbalance between coagulation and fibrinolysis is one of the essential pathophysiological processes of TDs [3]. Under pathophysiological conditions, owing to the overproduction of thrombin and uncontrolled hydrolysis from fibrinogen (FIB) to fibrin, insoluble fibrin fibers can precipitate in the blood vessel, which poses a clinical challenge for treatment [4]. Therefore, there is a significant demand for thrombolytic agents to treat patients with TDs. Fibrinolytic enzymes are proteases responsible for degrading fibrin in thrombus. Based on their mechanism, fibrinolytic enzymes can be divided into two types: One is plasminogen activators, such as tissue type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and urokinase, which can hydrolytic plasminogen into plasmin; the other is fibrin(ogen)olytic enzyme, such as nattokinase and lumbrokinase [5]. Recently, several fibrinolytic enzymes have been applied clinically as thrombolytic agents. However, these agents have limitations in clinical settings, such as the high cost, short half-life, and side effects, which include excessive bleeding and low specificity for fibrin [6,7]. Therefore, significant research efforts have been devoted to identifying more effective and specific fibrinolytic agents from natural sources, especially marine environments.\nMicroorganisms 2022, 10, 843. https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms10050843 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/microorganisms\nMicroorganisms 2022, 10, 843 2 of 17\nAlthough certain fibrinolytic enzymes from marine environments have been purified and characterized, the vast diversity of marine resources can be exploited further [8]. Given that marine organisms are exposed to extreme environments of high pressure, temperature, and salinity over a prolonged period, enzymes produced by marine microorganisms likely have advantages over those produced by terrestrial microorganisms [9]. Moreover, it is believed that the saline content of seawater in natural and chemically is very similar to human blood plasma, thus these enzymes may have lower or even no toxicity and side effects when used for thrombus therapy [10]. Therefore, the marine environment will have strong potential to discover novel fibrinolytic enzymes with unique biochemical properties. Bacillus velezensis was found on the river-bank of V\u00e9lez in M\u00e1laga, Spain in 2005 and produces various metabolic intermediates, such as antibiotics, antioxidants, antifungal factors, and growth promoters [11,12]. Data on Bacillus velezensis have been applied widely to the field of biological control and promotion of plant growth [13] and have shown its potential as a probiotic [14]. However, several studies only reported the discovery of and cloned fibrinolytic enzyme in Bacillus velezensis [15\u201318], therefore, it is a topic of further research. In the present study, a fibrinolytic protease (named Velefibrinase) was purified from marine B. velezensis Z01, which was screened from sea mud and its biochemical property was characterized. In addition to determining the thrombolytic pattern and the antiplatelet and anticoagulation properties of Velefibrinase, we evaluated the safety of its clinical application. Finally, the therapeutic potency of Velefibrinase was tested on in a rodent animal model."

The plates were incubated at 37 \u25e6C for 48 h, and the fibrinolytic potency was evaluated by the diameter ratio of transparent circle to bacterial colony. The promising strains were selected according to the diameter ratio. From the above results, one potential bacterial strain with the highest fibrinolytic to caseinolytic (F/C) ratio was selected for further study. The taxonomic identification of the potential strain was performed by (a) biochemical properties and phenotypic characterization; (b) sequencing of the 16S rRNA, gyrB and rpoB genes and phylogenetic analysis; (c) observation of cell morphology using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The deduced nucleotide sequences were searched using BLASTn, and homologous sequences were retrieved from GenBank databases. Using the MEGA7 multiple sequence alignment program, the partial 16S rDNA, gyrB, and rpoB genes were aligned with homologous DNA sequences deposited in the NCBI databases. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining method."

The supernatant was obtained by centrifuging at 10,000 rpm for 10 min after allowing to stand for 12 h, and was filtered and concentrated in a tangential flow membrane filtration system (GE, Amersham, Westborough, MA, USA]. Subsequently, the concentrated supernatant was applied to the t-Butyl HIC column (Macro-Prep\u00ae, Hercules, CA, USA) pre-equilibrated with 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer containing 1.9 M ammonium sulfate, and then eluted with 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer with pH 7.5. Next, the fractions of fibrinolytic activity were pooled, dialyzed against a glycine-sodium hydroxide buffer (pH 10.0), concentrated and loaded up to a DEAE-Sephadex (Macro-Prep\u00ae, Hercules, CA, USA) column, and eluted with the same buffer containing 1 M sodium chloride. Finally, the active fractions were collected, desalted, lyophilized, and identified using 12% SDS-PAGE. The secondary structure of the enzyme was determined using a circular dichroism (CD) analyzer (MOS-450, CBIO-LOGIC, France) as per a previously described method [20]. The CD spectrum of Velefibrinase was analyzed, and a secondary structure was inferred using CDPro (http://lamar.colostate.edu/~sreeram/CDPro, accessed on 12 August 2021). Moreover, an aliquot of trypsin-digested peptide fragments of purified and desalted enzymes (1.0 \u00b5g) was ascertained by MALDI-TOF-MS (4800, Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA, USA) analysis using a synapinic acid matrix [21]."

The absorbance was determined at 595 nm using a plate reader (MULTISKAN GO, Thermo Scientific, Vantaa, Finland). BSA was used as standard, according to manufacturer instructions. Both plasminogen-free and plasminogen-rich fibrin plates were used to measure fibrinolytic activity following the method described by Astrup [23]. Subsequently, samples were carefully added into each hole, which was punched into the plate and incubated at 37 \u25e6C for 12 h. Fibrinolytic activity was evaluated by the area of the clear zone around each hole and the urokinase as a control. The degradation patterns of FIB and fibrin were analyzed following the method described by Liu [5] with minor modifications.

            "text": "In this study, a strain that produce fibrinolytic enzyme was screened from marine mud of the South China Sea. By sequencing and conducting blast alignment of three conserved genes, 16 rDNA, gyrB, and rpoB, combined with physiological and phenotypic characteristics analysis, it was confirmed that the strain belonged to B. velezensis named Z01. B. velezensis has been widely used in the agro-industrial field, such as for biological control and yield improvement [14]. Moreover, Ye et al. [30] reported that the use of B. velezensis as a feed additive to replace feed antibiotics enhanced production performance and egg quality and demonstrated its potential as a probiotic. However, there are a few reports on fibrinolytic protease from B. velezensis. Velefibrinase (a fibrinolytic protease) was purified to homogeneity following four steps, with a 6.58% recovery and a 7.77-fold increase in specific activity. It is worth noting that a large amount of enzyme activity was lost during the alcohol precipitation step, which may have been caused by the limited range of alcohol concentrations in alcohol precipitation. Nevertheless, this selection was beneficial for the removal of impurities and subsequent purification. According to SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF-MS, the molecular mass of Velefibrinase was approximately 32.3 KDa, which was comparable to the molecular mass of other fibrinolytic enzymes (18\u201338 KDa) isolated from other genera of Bacillus [31]. The molecular mass of Velefibrinase was lower than that of many other fibrinolytic enzymes, such as Brevithrombolase (56 KDa) [32] and Russelobin (51.3 KDa) [27], but also higher than that of several fibrinolytic enzymes such as PAIEM (14.9 KDa) [33] and C142 (23.5 KDa) [34]. Moreover, Velefibrinase belonged to the peptidase S8 family (subtilisin family, clan SB), which is similar to other fibrinolytic enzymes purified from B. velezensis SW5 [18]. Velefibrinase maintained fibrinolytic activity across a broad range of pHs and temperatures, with an optimum pH and temperature 7.0 and 40 \u25e6C, which is in line with the physiological environment of the human body. This finding is the same as that of other fibrinolytic enzymes from Streptomyces radiopugnans VITSD8 [35] and Serratia marcescens [36], which are all derived from the marine environment. In addition, Velefibrinase became unstable at temperatures above 70 \u25e6C, which verified that the enzyme had good thermal stability. In the CD spectrum, Velefibrinase showed a depth negative ellipticity at 221 nm, which can explain the good thermal stability [20]. Inhibition studies can offer valuable insight into the nature of the active center of enzymes [37]. Because PMSF and EDTA strongly inhibited the fibrinolytic activity of Velefibrinase, this suggested that Velefibrinase is a serine and metalloprotease enzyme. Moreover, the inhibition of enzyme activity in the presence of a \u03b2-mercaptoethanol environment indicated that intramolecular disulfide bonds may exist in protease. Generally, metal cations play an essential role in the regulation of enzyme activity. In this study, Cu2+, Zn2+, Fe3+, and Co+ significantly inhibited enzyme activity, which reveal that these cations intrude and bind to carboxyl groups that may be an essential component of the active center of the enzyme. In contrast, Ca2+ and Mg2+ significantly improve fibrinolytic activity, which is similar to the novel fibrinolytic enzyme isolated from Lyophyllum shimeji [38]. Fibrinolytic enzymes are usually classified into \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b1/\u03b2 fibrinogenases on the basis of degradation of A\u03b1-chain or B\u03b2-chain of FIB [37]. Based on degradation pattern of fibrin and FIB, Velefibrinase should be classified as \u03b1/\u03b2-fibrinogenase. On the one hand, the Km of Velefibrinase to fibrin was 8.57 \u00b5mol/L (2.91 g/L), which was lower than that of Bvsp (3.19 g/L) which was from a marine bacterium B. vallismortis, and JP-I (0.43 mmol/L), II (0.69 mmol/L) which was from a Korean traditional fermented food, but higher than that of lumbrokinase (2.67 g/L) [39,40]. On the other hand, the Km of Velefibrinase to FIB was 18.16 \u00b5mol/L (6.17 g/L), which was higher than FIB content in human plasma (2.4\u20135.0 g/L) and that of nattokinase (2.19 g/L) [2]. Therefore, Velefibrinase preferentially degrades fibrin and may not induce side effects, such as excessive bleeding. A higher F/C ratio indicated that fibrin could be degraded efficiently and quickly [37]. Moreover, the F/C ratio of Velefibrinase (1.48) was higher than that of human plasmin (1.33) and other bacterial fibrinolytic enzymes, such as FCF-11 (0.71), Subtilisin BPN (0.32), Subtilisin Carlsberg\nMicroorganisms 2022, 10, 843 14 of 17\n(0.92), protease from B. licheniformis (0.93) and fibrinolytic serine metalloprotease from marine S. marcescens subsp. sakuensis (0.31) [36,41,42]. However, it has also been reported that the F/C ratio of Velefibrinase is lower than that of Brevithrombolase (2260.0) [32] and Bacethrombase (24.0) [43]. Furthermore, Velefibrinase converts plasminogen into plasmin, which further demonstrates its efficient thrombolytic ability. In summary, these findings indicate that Velefibrinase has high fibrinolytic efficiency to degrade the thrombus. Platelet aggregation plays an essential role in physiological hemostasis and thrombosis [44]. Velefibrinase inhibits platelet aggregation; however, its anti-platelet aggregation ability is lower than that of other fibrinolytic enzymes [43]. Conversely, this mild inhibition of platelet aggregation can reduce the risk of bleeding, which is more conducive to clinical applications. The anti-platelet aggregation activity of Velefibrinase in PRP was lower than that in WP, which suggested that Velefibrinase acts on other proteins in plasma. Thus, this influences the anti-platelet ability of Velefibrinase in PRP. Moreover, we noted that Velefibrinase inhibited platelet aggregation in WP. Because Velefibrinase is a macromolecule, it is unlikely to interact with intercellular factors in signaling pathways. Therefore, Velefibrinase may act directly on platelet membrane receptors and/or integrins to inhibit platelet aggregation. In addition to the inhibition of platelet aggregation, Velefibrinase may also intervene with coagulation cascades. The blood coagulation cascade is divided into intrinsic, extrinsic, and common pathways. APTT was used to evaluate the factors in the intrinsic and common pathways of blood coagulation, such as factors VIII, IX, XI, and vWF, whereas PT was used to assess extrinsic coagulation factors, such as factors V, VII, and X. TT reflected the fibrin polymerization process and was considered the third coagulation phase, together with FIB [26]. These results demonstrated that the anticoagulant action of Velefibrinase during dose-dependent treatment is modified by both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of the blood coagulation cascade. To preliminarily investigate the safety of Velefibrinase as a clinical application, we carried out hemolysis and hemorrhagic activity tests. They indicated that Velefibrinase exhibited no hemolysis for erythrocyte in vitro and no hemorrhagic activity in vivo. This result is similar to other fibrinolytic enzymes from Bacillus, which has a good safety profile [32,37,43]. Moreover, the thrombolytic activity of Velefibrinase in vivo was measured in a \u03ba-carrageenan-induced tail thrombus model, which has the major advantages of visibility of the thrombus infraction region and accuracy [45]. Results indicated that the Velefibrinase significantly ameliorated the length of the tail thrombus, and the therapeutic efficacy significantly surpassed that of an equal dose of urokinase. Moreover, the thrombolytic activity of Velefibrinase in vivo was found to be superior to that of Subtilisin QK [45], DEF [46], u-PA [47], and lumbrokinase [48], but inferior to that of streptokinase [43]. Therefore, this suggested that Velefibrinase is a safe thrombolytic or blood-thinning agent for clinical applications in patients with hyperfibrinogenemia and associated thrombolytic disorders."
