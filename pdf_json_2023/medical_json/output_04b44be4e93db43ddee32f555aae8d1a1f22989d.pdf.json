Using data from the TREATgermany registry, this study investigated how patients rated the severity of their itch and how it affected their dermatological quality of life. The results show that patients associated itch more strongly with selfreported outcomes than with physician\u2019s assessments. This indicates that the reduction in itch should be a central focus of patient-centred care for patients with atopic dermatitis. TREATgermany is an investigator-initiated prospective disease registry. It investigates physician- and patient-reported disease severity (Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), objective Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (oSCORAD), Investigator Global Assessment, Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM), Patient Global Assessment (PGA)), patient-reported symptoms (itch, sleep loss, depressive symptoms), therapy courses and dermatological quality of life (DLQI) in moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis with SCORAD > 20. 1,134 atopic dermatitis patients (mean age 41.0 \u00b1 14.7 years, 42.5% females) were enrolled by 40 German recruiting sites (dermatological clinics and practices) between June 2016 and April 2021. The current analysis focuses on itch scores obtained with a numerical rating scale (NRS)) documented for the previous 3 days prior to baseline visit. The results show that 97.2% (1,090 of 1,121) patients experienced itch. Itch severity correlated moderately with severity of atopic dermatitis oSCORAD (rho = 0.44 (0.39\u20130.48)) and EASI score (rho = 0.41 (0.36\u20130.46)). A strong correlation was found with self-reported disease severity as PGA (rho = 0.68 (0.65\u20130.71)), POEM sum score (rho = 0.66 (0.63\u20130.69)) and dermatological quality of life impairment DLQI (rho = 0.61 (0.57\u20130.65)). Itch as a subjective complaint is more closely correlated with patient-reported outcomes than with objective assessments by the physician.\nKey words: EASI; POEM; pruritus; quality of life; registry.\nAccepted Jan 4, 2023; Published Jan 23, 2023\nActa Derm Venereol 2023; 103: adv00854.\nDOI: 10.2340/actadv.v103.4426\nCorr: Elke Weisshaar, Occupational Dermatology, Department of Dermatology, University of Heidelberg, DE-69115 Heidelberg, Germany. E-mail: elke.weisshaar@med.uni-heidelberg\nTreatment and medical care of patients with moderate-to-severe Atopic Dermatitis (TREATgermany) is an investigator-initiated prospective disease registry of patients with moderate to severe affected atopic dermatitis (AD) in Germany and it is part of the European registry family TREAT. It represents a standardized assessment of treatment and outcomes in daily routine care of patients with AD. TREATgermany includes patients 18 years or older with moderate-to-severe AD (objective Scoring Atopic Dermatitis; oSCORAD > 20) consulting a dermatology department or a dermatology practice in\nA ct\naD V\nA ct\naD V\nA d v a n\nc e s\nin d\ne rm\na to\nlo g y a\nn d v\ne n\ne re\no lo\ng y\nA c ta\nD e rm\na to\n-V e n\ne re\no lo\ng ic\na\nActa Derm Venereol 2023\nGermany (A separate TREATkids for patients under 18 years was started in 2020. This data is not analysed here). First analyses demonstrated a high disease burden and a great need for systemic treatments (1, 2). Dupilumab, the first biologic for AD, which was launched in Germany in December 2017, showed similar effectiveness on clinical signs, symptoms and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) as in clinical trials (3). Itch was significantly reduced 3 months after dupilumab treatment (3).\nItch is the defining symptom of AD and occurs chronically (4\u20136). It affects patients in severe bouts occurring for minutes to hours, as well as constantly, on a daily basis. Itch constitutes a dominant symptom that characterizes active disease, but patients with AD also report that itch often occurs when the skin looks (macroscopically) nondiseased. Often, itch may be the first symptom of an AD relapse/flair (7). Patient focus groups reported AD-related itching to be the most bothersome AD symptom (8). The German Atopic Dermatitis Intervention Study (GADIS), including 823 children and adolescents, showed significant, but weak, correlations between itch intensity and AD disease severity (9). Another study showed similar relationships (10). Consequentially, studying the symptom of itch in AD remains important and challenging. TREATgermany provides an opportunity to gain more insight into itch in daily routine care. Since 89.0% of patients with AD in TREATgermany stated that it is \u201cvery important\u201d for them to be free of itch, it was the aim of this analysis to investigate itch in relation to physician- and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs)."

Patients are recruited at dermatological practices, clinics and university hospitals. The registry has been described in detail elsewhere (2). Patients with moderate-to-severe AD, current or prior (in the past 2 years) systemic anti-inflammatory treatment and/or objective SCORAD (Scoring Atopic Dermatitis, oSCORAD) > 20 are prospectively followed over the course of at least 24 months. A broad set of physician- and patient-reported outcome measures are documented using validated measurement instruments (1, 2).\nIn SCORAD, mean itch intensity caused by AD during the past 3 days, was rated by the patients on a numerical rating scale (NRS) ranging from 0 (no itch) to 10 (maximum imaginable itch). The association between various verifiable (documented by the treating physician) and PROMs and itch of patients enrolled in the registry from June 2016 until April 2021 was examined. Investigator-reported outcomes were oSCORAD (11), Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) (12) and Investigator Global Assessment (IGA; levels 0 (healed) to 5 (extremely severe)) (13).\nPROMs were Patient Global Assessment (PGA), PatientOriented Eczema Measure (POEM) (14), Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) (15), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) (16) and the Patient Benefit Index (PBI) (17). In addition, pain and sleep loss caused by AD during the past 3 days rated on a numerical\nrating scale ranging from 0 (no disturbance) to 10 (unbearable disturbance) were examined. This approach is identical to the SCORAD to ensure comparability. The analysis focuses on the baseline visit. Software Package Stata 15 (StataCorp LLC, Texas, USA) was used for descriptive and explorative data analyses: Pearson\u2019s \u03c72 test, Spearman\u2019s rank sum test and rank correlation including 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were used for describing associations. The qualitative interpretation of the strength of correlation follows Landis and Koch (18)."

At baseline registry patients had mean oSCORAD of 40.8 \u00b1 16.0 and EASI scores of 16.2 \u00b1 12.9. 53.5% of them (n = 603) were mildly/ moderately (mild respectively moderate erythema, papule forming and infiltrate) and 39.0% (n = 440) were (very) severely affected (severe erythema, papule forming and infiltrate (with oozing/crusting)) by AD according to the IGA (Table I).\nItch severity in the study population A total of 1,121 patients (98.9%) provided data on their itch in the past 3 days prior to baseline visit. 97.2% (n = 1,090 ) of those patients with itch (NRS score > 0). 504 (45.0%) had itch scores of 7 and higher, indicating severe itch (19). Mean itch severity was 5.7 \u00b1 2.7 and was significantly higher in females (6.1 \u00b1 2.8) compared with males (5.5 \u00b1 2.7) (rank-sum test, p < 0.001). There was no relevant (linear) correlation between itch and age (Table II). Compared with pain (3.7 \u00b1 2.8) and sleep loss (4.6\u00b13.4), which were gathered in the same way as itch, itch was the symptom with the highest rating (20). There was no significant association between itch severity and self-reported allergic comorbidities, asthma, allergic rhinitis or food allergy.\nThe relationship between disease duration of AD and itch severity was analysed according to age and sex (n = 1,101). As expected, due to the typical manifestation of AD early in life, the mean disease duration increased with increasing age, with the age group 51\u201360 years having the longest disease duration (n = 219, 39.9 \u00b1 18.0 years). However, the proportion of patients who reported having only had AD for a relatively short time (2 years or less) was higher in the group of patients over 60 years of age than in younger patients (16.1%\nvs 1.5%). The mean itch according to the disease duration stratified by age and sex is shown in Table III. No correlation between duration of disease and itching is apparent; however, recall bias might reduce the reliability of the data.\nTable IV shows the influence of itch severity on the importance of being free from itch measured by the PBI. Regardless of sex and reported itch severity, this issue was rated to be \u201cquite\u201d or \u201cvery important\u201d in 93.8% and up to 100% of cases. This underlines the high importance of effectively treating this AD symptom and understanding its correlation with other outcomes.\nA weak positive correlation was observed between itch severity and physician-rated severity of AD measured by oSCORAD (rho = 0.44 (0.39\u20130.48)), EASI score (rho = 0.41 (0.36\u20130.46)) and IGA (rho = 0.46 (0.42\u20130.51)) (Fig. 1). A strong positive correlation was found between itch and patient-reported disease severity, as assessed by means of the PGA (rho = 0.68 (0.65\u20130.71)) and POEM sum score (rho = 0.66 (0.63\u20130.69)). The results are describ ed in detail in Fig. 2. Strong positive correlations were also found for itch and DLQI (rho = 0.61 (0.57\u20130.65)) (Fig. 2).\nTable II.

            "text": "This study found strong correlations between itch severity and PROMs, such as POEM, DLQI, and PGA. This indicates that itch places substantial burden on patients with AD. On the other hand, physician-rated disease severity was not as closely correlated with itch. This suggests that it is important for clinicians who treat patients with AD to regularly assess itch. If itch and other patient-reported outcomes are not assessed, physicians may underestimate the burden of disease and patient needs.\nIn a recent analysis in TREATgermany, patients with AD who smoke cigarettes showed a higher disease burden, including higher itch scores compared with non-smokers (21).\nThe frequency of itch and the impairment of dermatological quality of life in patients with AD have been described previously; however, the current study results demonstrates that itch as a subjective complaint is more closely associated with patient-reported outcomes than with objective assessments by the physician. This reflects the difficulty of assessing AD with its range of phenotypes, clinical pictures and symptoms. HOME (Harmonizing Outcome Measures in Eczema) is an initiative of experts who defined a core outcome set containing clinical signs, patient-reported symptoms, long-term control and dermatological quality of life (www.homeforeczema. org). The peak itch numerical rating scale (NRS) of the past 24 h is the recommended instrument for measuring the intensity of itch in the symptom domain in trials of older children and adults (20). Since the TREATgermany registry was started before this recommendation, this method of measuring itch was only implemented in the data collection in 2021, so it could not yet be used for\nA ct\naD V\nA ct\naD V\nA d v a n\nc e s\nin d\ne rm\na to\nlo g y a\nn d v\ne n\ne re\no lo\ng y\nA c ta\nD e rm\na to\n-V e n\ne re\no lo\ng ic\na\nActa Derm Venereol 2023\nthis analysis. Recap of AD (RECAP) was developed recently and introduced to capture the experience of eczema control over the past week. Two of the 7 questions address itch explicitly within 5 answer options, which are \u201cno days\u201d, \u201c1\u20132 days\u201d, \u201c3\u20134 days\u201d, \u201c5\u20136 days\u201d and \u201cevery day\u201d, respectively (22).\nIn a study with 410 patients with AD, changes from the baseline in NRS, VRS and frequency of itch were weakly to moderately correlated with other patient-reported outcomes (POEM, SCORAD-itch, DLQI) (23). Another study showed a significant decrease in DLQI scores for patients with itch improvement after 16 weeks of treatment (24). Mediation models also showed an indirect effect of AD treatment on DLQI scores via reduction in the severity of pruritus (25).\nIt is known that patient-reported AD severity appears to be sufficiently valid for assessing AD severity in the clinical and epidemiological setting (26); however, physician-reported outcome measures show low or moderate correlation to itch.\nThe FSS has been shown to be a valuable tool to assess and quantify fatigue (27). The awareness and assessment of fatigue has also been underestimated previously and remains an under-recognized problem in AD. In addition to being a disease-related symptom, fatigue can be induced by systemic medications. Fatigue may be caused in AD by sedating antihistamines.\nThe growing list of comorbidities was also confirmed in TREATgermany and reflects the increasing appreciation of its high burden (28). More knowledge about this is necessary to improve the possibilities of medical and psychological interventions.\nPathophysiology and pathogenesis of itching in AD are still not fully understood. A crosstalk between the nervous system, the cutaneous immune system and keratinocyte population explain the origin and persistence of itch in AD (29). Itching in AD is influenced by various factors, such as triggers (e.g. sweat, clothing, allergens, such as dust mites, pollens, food allergens, as well as infections and psychological factors) (4, 5, 30). This explains why treating atopic itch remains a great challenge. Novel approaches have been described, however, with variable effects on itch (29). It is most likely that treating itch sufficiently means targeting inflammation, neural and neuroimmune pathways. Elucidating the roles of peripheral and central sensitization and hypersensitization in AD is a future task (29); however, investigating patient-reported outcomes of atopic itch supports this task.\nThe strength of these analyses can be summarized as follows: this study investigated itch in a large cohort of patients with AD. As TREATgermany is a registry study the data are obtained in a very similar and uniform pattern in AD clinics. The results attain special importance because the impact of measuring patient-reported outcomes in dermatology has been underestimated in the past, but has also gained increasing significance for drug\ndevelopment (31). As itch is a subjective symptom, which is not easy to score, it is not surprising that itch is more closely associated with patient-reported outcomes than with objective physician assessment.\nA limitation of this analysis is measuring itch in only the previous 3 days, as is done in SCORAD, because itch in AD is chronic and long-lasting. The data were obtained in a single country not resembling cultural and ethnic aspects of itch (32). It remains to be seen if these results will be confirmed, for example in TARGET-DERM AD study, a longitudinal cohort study that plans to include 4,000 patients with AD in up to 100 clinical centres in the USA (33). The representativeness of the data is limited by the fact that participation in the registry is voluntary (on the part of both centres and patients).\nIn the future, TREATgermany may improve our understanding of how AD can be treated more effectively over time to reduce its impact, especially the impact of itch, on all domains of life, including cumulative life impairment."
