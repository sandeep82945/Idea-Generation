            "text": "Compared with traditional chemotherapy, phototherapy has many advantages, such as less invasiveness, high selectivity, and little cosmetic damage to the patients [1]. Because of these substantial advantages, phototherapy is considered as a viable strategy for cancer treatment. Now, phototherapy is being extensively researched, including photothermal therapy (PTT), photodynamic therapy (PDT), light-responsive molecule delivery, and light-controlled combination therapy [2, 3].\nAs a minimally invasive therapeutic strategy, PDT has gained widespread attention in the treatment of many superficial and confined tumors [4, 5]. PDT is an effective way to treat tumors, which can induce apoptosis in tumor cells by generating cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) [6\u20139]. Oxygen plays an important role in the efficacy of PDT. However, in the development of tumors, the oxygen supply from surrounding blood vessels cannot meet the huge demand for oxygen by tumor cells, leading to the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, with the consumption of oxygen in PDT, the oxygen available for the generation of cytotoxic ROS will be further reduced, which can strongly restrict the efficacy of PDT [10]. Many approaches were reported to overcome the limitations of PDT efficacy by enhancing oxygen supply [11]. For example, hemoglobin was used as the oxygen carrier to relieve the hypoxic microenvironment for enhanced photodynamic cancer therapy [12]. MnO2 is another important compound for the modulation of the tumor hypoxic microenvironment, which can induce the decomposition of H2O2 into oxygen [13, 14]. Reducing oxygen consumption by tumor cells might be another strategy to relieve the tumor hypoxic microenvironment [15, 16]. For example, cellular respiration can consume oxygen. Tumor hypoxia might be relieved by inhibiting cellular respiration, which might provide an important way to relieve tumor hypoxia. However, the relief of tumor hypoxia by reducing oxygen consumption is still rarely reported [17].\nPhotothermal therapy (PTT) is another widely adopted form of phototherapy, which can convert light energy into heat energy using photothermal agents after light irradiation. Localized hyperthermia can lead to the denaturation of cancer cell proteins, cell membrane damage, and other cytotoxic effects, which can lead to cell death [18\u201321]. However, in the practical application of PTT in treating tumors, relative high temperature (> 50\u00a0\u00b0C) at the tumor site is usually required, which will damage normal tissues near the tumor, causing a series of adverse effects. What\u2019s more, the hyperthermia of tumor cells by PTT will stimulate their own repair mechanism and obtain tolerance to heat stress, which greatly reduces the efficacy of PTT. Therefore, there is an urgent need to reduce the thermal tolerance of tumor cells to achieve effective\nPTT. It has been found that the rapid production of heat shock proteins (HSPs) is widely observed in mammalian cells facing thermal stimuli [22]. HSPs are protective proteins that improve thermal tolerance and the self-stability of cells [23, 24]. The traditional method of inhibiting heat shock protein synthesis is mainly achieved by small molecular inhibitors (e.g., garcinic acid, 17-AAG, JG-98, etc.) or siRNA [25, 26]. However, most HSP inhibitors suffer from poor water solubility and high toxicity, while siRNAs are unstable and tend to have low delivery efficiency, limiting the application of these methods in the process of low-temperature photothermal therapy. Some methods were also reported to inhibit HSPs through gas therapy [27]. Since the production of HSPs is energy dependent, the inhibition of HSPs can also be achieved by reducing intracellular ATP production [28].\nThere are also many studies combining PDT and PTT for tumor treatment. The combination of PTT and PDT shows multiple advantages in improving the efficiency of tumor therapy [29, 30]. The combination of PDT and PTT inherits the advantages of low toxicity and side effects of phototherapy, and also enables the two treatment modalities to complement each other, which is an effective strategy to improve efficacy and reduce the side effects. In some studies, different photosensitizers and photothermal agents were integrated into one system. However, they are limited by the fact that they cannot be stimulated by the same light source to produce PDT and PTT effects [31]. The molecules that can be simultaneously used as photosensitizers and photothermal agents are more promising. For example, IR780 can absorb nearinfrared (NIR) light, and subsequently produce both PDT and PTT effects under the stimulation of near-infrared light (808\u00a0 nm) [32\u201334]. Compared with the commonly used near-infrared fluorescent dye, indocyanine green (ICG), IR780 shows better photostability and has a stronger fluorescence intensity, which deserves our attention [35, 36].\nHerein, we put forward an innovative strategy to use the glycolysis inhibitor LND to enhance PDT and PTT of IR780 (Scheme 1). Due to the low toxicity and immunogenicity of liposomes, liposomes are used as drug delivery vehicles to encapsulate IR780 and LND. Lonidamine (LND) is an inhibitor of hexokinase and mitochondrial pyruvate carrier of glycolysis [37, 38]. LND might be used as a hypoxia ameliorator by reducing oxygen consumption, which can increase intracellular oxygen accumulation. Therefore, under the action of LND, more oxygen can be used as raw material to generate toxic ROS through PDT. As an important reducing agent in the body, glutathione (GSH) can consume ROS during PDT, which can restrict the therapeutic efficacy of PDT. Meanwhile, the decrease of GSH level by LND is also expected to improve PDT effect in cancer therapy. At the same\ntime, LND is expected to inhibit cellular respiration to cut off energy production [39\u201341]. We intend to downregulate the expression of HSPs in cancer cells by inhibiting the production of ATP, improving the therapeutic efficacy of PTT [42\u201344]. All these actions of LND may promote the production of ROS in PDT and simultaneously achieve reduced thermotolerance of tumor cells in PTT."

The drug encapsulated liposomes, Lip-IR780, Lip-LND, and Lip-IR780/LND, were prepared by the classical lipid film hydration method. The drug loading content (DLC) and entrapment efficiency (EE) of Lip-IR780, Lip-LND, and Lip-IR780/LND were calculated and the results were shown in Table S1. To confirm the formation of liposomal nanodrugs, the morphologies were revealed by cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM). All of the liposomes exhibited monolayered liposomal structures with a diameter of approximately 100\u00a0nm (Fig.\u00a01a-c). The surface charge of the liposomes was then studied by measuring zeta potential. As shown in Fig.\u00a01d, the zeta potential of Lip-IR780, Lip-LND, and Lip-IR780/LND were \u2212 14.9 mV, -14.0 mV, and \u2212 13.2 mV, respectively. Furthermore, the intensity average hydrodynamic diameters of Lip-IR780, Lip-LND, and Lip-IR780/ LND were 123.9\u00a0 nm, 103.0\u00a0 nm, and 134.8\u00a0 nm, respectively, measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS), as shown in Fig.\u00a0 1e-g. Thus, we demonstrated that drugloaded liposomes with the size of about 100\u00a0nm were successfully prepared, which can be used for systemic drug delivery via blood transport and also for passive targeting of tumors via the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR) effect.\nThe excellent stability of nanoparticles is a key requirement for their systemic intravenous administration. We then determined the stability of liposomal nanodrugs by measuring the size of the three nanodrugs in PBS using DLS consecutively. The results of DLS showed that the liposomal nanodrugs did not undergo significant particle size changes, and the polydispersity index (PDI) was almost unchanged after 7 days\u2019 incubation (Fig.\u00a01hj). These results demonstrated that the dug-loaded liposomes prepared by this method exhibited good stability.\nIR780 was used as a photosensitizer and photothermal agent simultaneously in this research. The photodynamic effect of Lip-IR780 was investigated at first. 2\u2032,7\u2032-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) was used\nas an ROS fluorescent probe to evaluate the ability of Lip-IR780 to generate ROS after laser irradiation since DCFH-DA can be oxidized to 2\u2032,7\u2032-dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCFH) by ROS. As shown in Fig.\u00a02a, the fluorescence intensity increased significantly with the increase of laser irradiation time, which indicated that Lip-IR780 could effectively generate ROS after 808\u00a0nm laser irradiation. The photothermal effect of Lip-IR780 was then studied. A significant increase of solution temperature was observed after Lip-IR780 solution was exposed to 808\u00a0nm laser irradiation. As the light intensity increased, the final temperature and heating rate increased accordingly, indicating the generation of heat can be well controlled by the light intensity (Fig.\u00a02b). Meanwhile, by comparing the photothermal effect of Lip-IR780 with different concentrations under the same light intensity, a higher concentration of IR780 induced a higher final temperature and a faster heating rate (Fig.\u00a02c). In addition, the increase of solution temperature after laser irradiation was also visually observed in infrared thermograms (Fig.\u00a02d). All these results indicated that IR780 could be used as an excellent photosensitizer and photothermal agent."

            "text": "Liposomes should be uptaken by cells to play the role. The internalization of drug-loaded liposomes by LM3 cells was first investigated by fluorescent microscopy. Although LND is non-fluorescent, IR-780 can be used as a fluorescent probe to study the internalization of liposomes. As shown in Fig. S1, strong red fluorescence of IR780 could be observed after LM3 cells were incubated with Lip-IR780 and Lip-IR780/LND, indicating efficient internalization of liposomes by LM3 cells. Meanwhile, a time-dependent increase in intracellular red fluorescence was observed (Fig. S1). LND is an anticancer drug that interferes with the energy metabolism of cancer cells, principally inhibiting glycolysis, by its inhibition effect of mitochondriallybound hexokinase (HK). As HK-II is the first key enzyme involved in glycolysis, it can be used as an indicator to evaluate the rate of glycolysis. As an HK inhibitor, LND\ncan block energy supply by inhibiting glycolysis, so LipLND might ultimately affect intracellular oxygen consumption. After incubation of Lip-IR780 and Lip-LND with LM3 cells for 24\u00a0 h, the relative intracellular HK level was evaluated by hexokinase activity assay kit. As shown in Fig.\u00a03a, the intracellular HK level almost did not change after incubating with different concentrations of IR780. However, if LM3 cells were incubated with LipLND, the intracellular HK level could be significantly reduced, suggesting the excellent inhibitory effect of LND on HK activity. During glycolysis, glucose undergoes a series of oxidative phosphorylation processes to produce lactose and pyruvate, which can then enter the mitochondria and participate in oxygen production via the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Therefore, the inhibition of glycolysis can be assessed by measuring lactate level. Lactate level was measured using a lactate assay kit to determine the extracellular lactate level after different treatments. As shown in Fig.\u00a03b, the extracellular lactate content was not affected after incubation with Lip-IR780. When LM3 cells were treated with Lip-LND, the extracellular lactate content decreased with increasing LND concentration, indicating that LND could effectively inhibit glycolysis. The reduction of lactate can further inhibit energy production in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of LM3 cells after different treatments was also measured using the OCR assay kit (Fig.\u00a03c). As consistent with the above results, the OCR of LM3 cells could be effectively reduced after incubation with Lip-LND. To sum up, Lip-LND could inhibit glycolysis to reduce oxygen consumption by inhibiting HK activity, which might increase intracellular oxygen accumulation. Since oxygen is the raw material in PDT, the integration of LND in PDT might relieve tumor hypoxia to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of PDT. GSH is an important intracellular antioxidant that can consume ROS to restrict the therapeutic efficacy of PDT. It is an effective way to improve the therapeutic efficacy of PDT by reducing intracellular GSH level. The influence of Lip-LND on intracellular GSH level was then evaluated. As shown in Fig.\u00a0 3d, intracellular GSH level was unaffected by Lip-IR780. In contrast, the intracellular GSH level was significantly reduced after incubating LM3 cells with Lip-LND or Lip-IR780/LND, which implied that LND could reduce the intracellular GSH level. The decrease of intracellular GSH level by LND was advantageous for photodynamic cancer therapy. The intracellular photodynamic effect of IR780 with or without LND was then investigated after 808\u00a0 nm laser irradiation. Intracellular ROS production was detected after incubating LM3 cells with Lip-LND, Lip-IR780 with laser irradiation (Lip-IR780 + L), and Lip-IR780/LND with laser irradiation (Lip-IR780/LND + L) using DCFHDA as the ROS probe (Fig.\u00a0 3e). The intracellular green fluorescence of the ROS probe was barely observed after Lip-LND treatment as observed microscopically. This is because even though LND could lead to a decrease of intracellular oxygen consumption and an increase in\noxygen accumulation, ROS cannot be produced in the absence of photosensitizers. However, strong green fluorescence was observed after LM3 cells were treated with Lip-IR780 + L or Lip-IR780/LND + L, which indicated the production of ROS due to the photodynamic effect of IR780. Interestingly, Lip-IR780/LND-treated cells exhibited stronger green fluorescence than Lip-IR780-treated cells, suggesting that LND could increase the production of ROS intracellularly, which implied that LND could enhance the photodynamic effect of IR780."

            "text": "As discussed above, LND could promote photodynamic effect by inhibiting cellular respiration. Cellular respiration is coupled to energy production in mitochondria. We elaborated on the effect of LND on mitochondrial energy production. Firstly, mitochondrial integrity was evaluated by observing the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) using the JC-10 mitochondrial membrane potential assay kit (Fig.\u00a0 4a). Under normal conditions, JC-10 assumes an aggregated form (JC-aggr) and accumulates in the mitochondrial matrix with red fluorescence. However, if the mitochondria are damaged and the membrane potential is lowered, JC-10 assumes a monomeric form (JC-mono) and appears to green fluorescence. After 24\u00a0h\nincubation of LM3 cells with Lip-IR780, JC-10 aggregated and showed red fluorescence under confocal fluorescence microscopy, suggesting intact mitochondrial membranes and healthy mitochondria. In contrast, LM3 cells incubated with Lip-LND and Lip-IR780/LND for 24\u00a0 h showed more intense green fluorescence of JC-10 monomers. The results suggested that LND-loaded liposomes can disrupt mitochondrial integrity.\nHSPs are key initiating proteins in the heat-resistant defense mechanisms triggered by tumors; thus, the overexpression of HSPs severely limits the anti-tumor efficacy of PTT. The production of HSPs is dependent on ATP provided by mitochondria. Intracellular ATP level after different treatments were then measured using the ATP kit. As shown in Fig.\u00a0 4b, Lip-IR780 had no effect on intracellular ATP production. However, the intracellular ATP level was significantly reduced after LM3 cells were incubated with Lip-LND, indicating that Lip-LND could effectively block energy supply. HSP90 is one of the most widely studied heat shock proteins. The expression of HSP90 after incubation of LM3 cells with Lip-IR780, Lip-LND, and Lip-IR780/LND was subsequently investigated by Western blot. As shown in Fig.\u00a0 4c and S3, the expression of HSP90 was unaffected after incubation of LM3 cells with Lip-IR780. In contrast, the expression of\nHSP90 was significantly reduced after incubation with Lip-LND and Lip-IR780/LND, indicating that LND could effectively inhibit the expression of HSP90 and increase the heat sensitivity of tumor cells.\nAfter confirming the multiple roles of LND in reducing oxygen consumption, down-regulating intracellular GSH level, and inhibiting HSPs expression, we further investigated whether LND could improve the therapeutic effect of IR780-triggered phototherapy. To demonstrate the therapeutic potential of LND in phototherapy, cell viability after different treatments was examined using the CCK-8 assay. As shown in Fig.\u00a0 4d, LM3 cells incubated with Lip-LND exhibited weak proliferation inhibition, indicating that inhibition of glycolysis by LND alone is not sufficient to inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells. The viability of LM3 cells was as high as 80% after incubating with 15\u00a0\u00b5g mL\u2212 1 Lip-LND (LND equivalent). Meanwhile, Lip-IR780 didn\u2019t show an obvious inhibitory effect on the proliferation of LM3 cells in the absence of light irradiation. In contrast, Lip-IR780 could inhibit the proliferation of LM3 cells under 808\u00a0nm laser irradiation. The viability of LM3 cells was about 60% after incubating with 7.5\u00a0\u00b5g mL\u2212 1 Lip-IR780 (IR780 equivalent) under laser irradiation. When LM3 cells were treated with LipIR780/LND under 808\u00a0 nm laser irradiation, the combined therapy group was found to reduce the survival rate of cancer cells to about 20%, achieving a powerful anti-tumor therapy. The remarkable proliferation inhibition ability of Lip-IR780/LND under laser irradiation might be attributed to the excellent glycolysis inhibitory effect of LND. LND could improve the therapeutic efficacy of photodynamic and photothermal therapy by reducing oxygen consumption, down-regulating intracellular GSH level, and inhibiting HSPs expression. Furthermore, the excellent phototherapy efficacy of Lip-IR780/ LND under laser irradiation was reconfirmed by live/ dead staining (Fig.\u00a0 4e). Firstly, the untreated group was unable to induce cell death with or without laser irradiation, demonstrating that light alone didn\u2019t show any antitumor effect. LM3 cells incubated with Lip-LND could only kill very few cancer cells, which indicated that 15\u00a0\u00b5g mL\u2212 1 LND might not be enough to induce efficient cell death. Due to the photodynamic and photothermal effects of IR780 under laser irradiation, many cancer cells were killed in \u201cLip-IR780 + L\u201d group. Compared to the \u201cLip-IR780 + L\u201d group, Lip-IR780/LND treatment\nwith laser irradiation can lead to much more cell death. After treatment with Lip-IR780/LND under 808\u00a0nm laser irradiation, almost all of the LM3 cells were dead, which further indicated that LND could effectively enhance the therapeutic efficacy of IR780-induced photodynamic and photothermal therapy."

After Lip-IR780/LND or free-IR780 were intravenously injected into LM3-bearing nude mice, the in vivo biodistribution of IR780 was recorded by whole body fluorescent imaging after 2\u00a0h, 6\u00a0h, 10\u00a0h, and 24\u00a0h. As shown in Fig.\u00a05a, a much stronger fluorescent signal of IR780 was observed in the tumor tissue of Lip-IR780/LND-treated mice than that of free IR780-treated mice. Therefore, LipIR780/LND could be effectively accumulated in tumor tissues, which was beneficial to the treatment of tumors. In addition, we explored the pharmacokinetics of liposomal drugs in mice.The tumor-free ICR mice were used to investigate the pharmacokinetics of Lip-IR780 after intravenous injection. As shown in Figure S3, the concentration of IR780 decreased to lower than 50% of the injected dose in plasma within 0.5\u00a0 h in free-IR780/LND treated group. However, the blood circulation time of IR780 was significantly prolonged in Lip-IR780/LND-treated group, with the circulation half-life of 23.06\u00a0h.\nSince LND could reduce oxygen consumption by inhibiting glycolysis, we further investigated whether LND can relieve tumor hypoxia in vivo. Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1 Alpha (HIF-1\u03b1) Kit and Hypoxyprobe-1 (HP-1) Kit were used to assess the level of hypoxia in tumor [45]. HIF-1\u03b1 and HP-1 are two markers of tissue hypoxia, which can reflect the degree of hypoxia within the tumor tissues and can be observed by immunofluorescence staining [46, 47]. When the tumor tissues are at a hypoxic level, bright green fluorescence can be observed. The fluorescent intensity will decrease when the hypoxia is relieved. According to the fluorescent signal of HIF-1\u03b1 in Fig.\u00a05b and c, the level of hypoxia in tumor tissues could be effectively relieved after the mice were treated with LipLND and Lip-IR780/LND. However, Lip-IR780 cannot influence tumor hypoxia. Moreover, the relief of tumor hypoxia by Lip-LND and Lip-IR780/LND was also confirmed by hypoxic probe HP-1 based tissue section (Fig. S4 and S5) All these results demonstrated that LND could relieve tumor hypoxia by reducing oxygen consumption,\nwhich could provide more oxygen for IR780-triggered PDT.\nDuring PTT in tumor therapy, the obvious temperature increase in tumor tissue was observed after 808\u00a0nm laser irradiation (Figure S6). Cytoprotective pathways of cancer cells can be activated under hyperthermia, leading to serious thermoresistance. HSPs are the key factor in thermoresistance, which are generally overexpressed under hyperthermia. The therapeutic effect of PTT can be improved by reducing the expression of HSP90. The expression of HSP90 in tumor tissues was then investigated by Western blot after different treatments. As shown in Fig.\u00a0 5d and e, the expression of HSP90 in the Lip-IR780 treated group was significantly increased after laser irradiation, which implied that IR780-triggered PTT can lead to thermoresistance. Interestingly, LipLND treatment could remarkably reduce HSP90 level to 44.8% in tumor tissues, which implied that LND could overcome thermoresistance in PTT. Therefore, compared to phototherapy with IR780 (Lip-IR780 + L group), the expression of HSP90 was reduced to 61.2% after combined therapy with IR780-triggered phototherapy and LND. In conclusion, we demonstrated that LND could effectively reduce HSP90 expression to overcome thermoresistance in PTT, which was critical in improving the therapeutic efficacy of PTT.\nThe in vivo antitumor effect of Lip-IR780/LND under laser irradiation was then evaluated by tracking the tumor volume change after LM3-bearing nude mice were injected with Lip-IR780/LND. The LM3 tumor-bearing nude mice were randomly divided into five groups (five mice in each group) and injected with different formulations (saline, Lip-IR780, Lip-IR780 + L, Lip-LND, and LipIR780/LND + L). When the tumor volume reached about 100 mm3, Lip-IR780, Lip-LND, and Lip-IR780/LND were injected into the mice by tail vein at days 1, 3 and 5. After 6\u00a0 h, the tumor tissues in Lip-IR780 + L and Lip-IR780/ LND + L treated groups were irradiated with 808\u00a0nm laser for phototherapy. Monitoring of tumor volume showed that Lip-LND alone was not effective in inhibiting tumor growth. Lip-IR780 with laser irradiation can inhibit tumor growth. However, Lip-IR780/LND with laser irradiation had the best therapeutic efficacy. (Fig.\u00a0 5f ). 18 days after treatment, the mice were sacrificed. The tumor tissues were harvested and weighted. The weight of the tumors after treated with saline, Lip-IR780, LipIR780 + L, Lip-LND, and Lip-IR780/LND + L were 0.83\u00a0g, 0.79\u00a0 g, 0.23\u00a0 g, 0.45\u00a0 g, and 0.07\u00a0 g, respectively (Fig.\u00a0 5g). The optimal therapeutic effect of Lip-IR780/LND + L was subsequently demonstrated by calculating the tumor inhibition rate. The tumor inhibition rate of Lip-IR780/ LND + L reached 90%, which was significantly higher than that of other treatment groups (Fig.\u00a05h). The above results demonstrated its favorable tumor-suppressive\neffect. Subsequently, in order to observe the tumor inhibition effect more directly, the dissected isolated tumors were photographed (Fig.\u00a05i), and the results showed that Lip-IR780/LND + L treatment had the smallest tumor size, once again demonstrating its excellent anti-tumor effect in vivo.\nTo further obtain insight into the antitumor activity of Lip-IR780/LND under laser irradiation, the histologic sections of tumor tissues were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, including H&E staining and TUNEL assay. As expected, the highest apoptosis and lowest proliferation levels were observed in Lip-IR780/LND-treated tumor tissues after laser irradiation (Fig. S7). All these results above further indicated the excellent antitumor capability of Lip-IR780/LND under laser irradiation."

Firstly, we monitored the weight of the mice during the treatment period and did not find any significant weight changes (Fig. S8). Then, hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining of the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys of mice after different treatments didn\u2019t show\nsignificant damage or histopathological toxicity, demonstrating the biological safety of the liposomal drugs (Fig.\u00a0 6). Finally, by assessing blood routine indicators including red blood cells, white blood cells (including the classification of white blood cells), platelets, and so on, no statistical differences were observed after different treatments (Fig. S9). All of these results indicated that the liposomal drugs showed excellent biosafety."

            "text": "In summary, we successfully prepared NIR probe IR780 and glycolysis inhibitor LND-loaded liposome LipIR780/LND for combined PDT/PTT. IR780 could perform both photodynamic therapy and photothermal therapy under the same light, while LND could effectively inhibit glycolysis after being taken up by LM3 cells. As an HK inhibitor, LND could effectively inhibit cellular respiration to reduce intracellular oxygen consumption to alleviate the hypoxic microenvironment of the tumor. Meanwhile, LND could also reduce intracellular GSH level. Therefore, more ROS can be generated in PDT. At the same time, LND could reduce energy supply by inhibiting glycolysis, which could down-regulate HSP90 level\nand therefore alleviate thermotolerance in tumor photothermal therapy. The in vivo results further confirmed the excellent tumor suppressive effects of LND enhanced. This study provides inspiration for future innovative designs of nanocarriers for enhanced photodynamic and photothermal therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https://doi. org/10.1186/s12951-023-02260-z.\nSupplementary Material 1\nAuthor contributions Lei Lei, Qiao Jin, and Zhe Tang designed experiments.
