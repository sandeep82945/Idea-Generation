The negative-parity, complex-structure final states in 38Ca were observed following the in-beam \u03b3-ray spectroscopy of events in the 9Be(38Ca, 38Ca + \u03b3)X reaction in which the scattered projectile lost longitudinal momentum of order \u2206p|| = 700 MeV/c. The characteristics of the observed final states are discussed and found to be consistent with the formation of excited states involving the rearrangement of multiple nucleons in a single, highly-energetic projectile-target collision. Unlike the far-less dissipative, surface-grazing reactions usually exploited for the in-beam \u03b3-ray spectroscopy of rare isotopes, these more energetic collisions appear to offer a practical pathway to nuclear-structure studies of more complex multi-particle configurations in rare isotopes \u2013 final states conventionally thought to be out of reach with high-luminosity fast-beam-induced reactions.\nBeyond the proof of existence of a rare isotope and the determination of its ground-state half-life, the energies of excited states are typically the first observables that become accessible in laboratory experiments. For excited bound states, depending on their lifetime, prompt or delayed \u03b3-ray spectroscopy is frequently used to obtain precise excitation energies from the measured transition energies [1]. In short-lived rare isotopes, excited states can be populated efficiently in (direct) nuclear reactions [2] or \u03b2 decay [3], for example, most often exploiting the unique selectivity inherent to each of these different population pathways. The selectivity of one- and two-nucleon transfer and knockout reactions, or inelastic scattering [2, 4\u2013 8], often enhances the population of excited states at moderate spin associated with the single-particle or collective degree of freedom. Here, we report the novel, complementary in-beam \u03b3-ray spectroscopy of higher-spin, negative-parity states in 38Ca, observed to be populated in the 9Be(38Ca, 38Ca + \u03b3)X inelastic scattering at high momentum loss. From the peculiar final states observed, we argue that these complex-structure, projectile excited states are formed by the rearrangement of multiple nucleons in a single, highly-energetic projectile-target collision, giving access to multi-particle configurations not expected to be in reach of high-luminosity fast-beam reactions.\nThe reaction channel analyzed here is populated in the same experiment as reported on in Ref. [9] where the focus was on 40Sc produced in the pn pickup reaction onto the 38Ca projectile. Here, we briefly summarize the experimental scheme below and refer the reader\nto Ref. [9, 16] for more details. The 38Ca rare-isotope beam was produced by fragmentation of a stable 40Ca beam, accelerated to 140 MeV/nucleon by the Coupled Cyclotron Facility at NSCL [10]. The momentum width transported to the experiment was restricted to \u2206p/p = 0.25%, resulting in 160,000 38Ca/s impinging upon a 188- mg/cm2-thick 9Be foil located at the target position of the S800 spectrograph [11]. The setting subject of this publication ran for less than 40 hours. The constituents of the incoming beam and the projectile-like reaction products were identified on an event-by-event basis using the S800 analysis beam line and focal plane with the standard detector systems [12]. As the magnetic rigidity of the S800 spectrograph was tuned for 36Ca, only part of the outermost (exponential) low-momentum tail of the reacted 38Ca distribution was transmitted to the focal plane. Specifically, the S800 momentum acceptance at this setting is p0 \u00b1 330 MeV/c, with p0 = 11.222 GeV/c.\nWhen compared to the parallel momentum distribution of the unreacted 38Ca passing through the target, having suffered only in-target energy losses (p0 = 11.932 GeV/c), the low-momentum, reacted 38Ca events detected in the reaction setting have undergone an additional longitudinal momentum loss of about 700 MeV/c (see Fig. 1). That is, approximately 18 MeV/c per nucleon in momentum or 5.4 MeV/nucleon in energy. The cross section for finding 38Ca with such large momentum loss was extracted to be \u03c3(p0 \u00b1 330 MeV/c) = 3.8(4) mb, making these inelastic large-momentum-loss events rather rare.\nThe mid-target energy of 38Ca in the 9Be reaction tar-\n2 38Ca (direct) p0=11.932 GeV/c\np=p-p0 Co un ts /b in\n0\u2212300 \u2212200 \u2212100 100 200 300 p (MeV/c)\n500\n400\n300\n200\n100\n0\n10 5\n30\n0\u2212200 \u2212100 100 200\n100\n300\n1000\n6000 2000 p0=11.222 GeV/c38Ca\nEnergy (keV)\n0\n0\n1\n2\n500 1500 2500\n25001500500\n100\n200\n300\nCo un\nts /k\neV direct dissipative\ndissipative\n(a)(b)\n(c)\nFIG. 1.

Insets (b) and (c) confront the \u03b3-ray spectra in coincidence with less than 100,500 38Ca at high momentum loss (black) and from nearly 179,000 38Ca in the direct setting (magenta), highlighting a stark difference in excitation probability.\nget was 60.9 MeV/nucleon. The target was surrounded by GRETINA [13, 14], an array of 48 36-fold segmented high-purity germanium crystals assembled into modules of four crystals each, used for prompt \u03b3-ray detection to tag the final states of the reaction residues. Signal decomposition was employed to provide the \u03b3-ray interaction points. Of these, the location of the interaction with the largest energy deposition was selected as the first hit entering the event-by-event Doppler reconstruction of the \u03b3 rays emitted from the reaction residues in-flight at about 33% of the speed of light [14].\nThe event-by-event Doppler reconstructed \u03b3-ray spectrum obtained in coincidence with the 38Ca reaction residues detected in the S800 focal plane at large momentum loss is shown in Fig. 2. Nearest neighbor addback, as detailed in [14], was used. Of the seven \u03b3-ray transitions compiled in [15], those at 2213(5), 1489(5), 489(4) and 3684(8) keV are observed here, while the transitions at 214(4), 1048(6), 2417(7), 2537(6), 2688(7), and 2758(7) keV are reported for the first time in the present work. This letter discusses the strongly-populated states. The reader is referred to the companion paper for details on some other weakly-populated states [16].\nTo construct the level scheme, \u03b3\u03b3 coincidences are used. Figure 3 shows the coincidence analysis of the low-energy part of the 38Ca spectrum. From Fig. 3, it is clear that the 1489-keV \u03b3 ray feeds the 2213-keV line, the 489-keV transition feeds the level depopulated by the 1489 keV, and the 214-keV transition lies on top of the level depopulated by the 489-keV transition.

These relative \u03b3-ray intensities were deduced from the efficiency-corrected peak areas from the spectrum displayed in Fig. 2. Remarkably, the fourth strongest \u03b3 ray, at 214 keV, has not been reported previously. The relative intensities and a more complete level scheme, including all \u03b3-ray transitions observed, is provided in Ref. [16].\nThe 1489-keV transition in coincidence with the 2+1 \u2192 0+1 decay is consistent with the previously reported (3\n\u2212) state at 3702 keV. The 489-keV transition in coincidence with the 3702-keV (3\u2212) state suggests a level at 4191 keV, which is consistent with a previously reported state at 4194 keV. However, the J\u03c0 assignment proposed in the literature of (5\u2212) [15] is unlikely as the 489-keV transition in our work is prompt, on the level of a few ps or faster as evident from the good resolution and absence of a lowenergy tail, which \u2013 if of E2 character \u2013 would indicate a B(E2; 5\u2212 \u2192 3\u2212) strength exceeding the recommended upper limit of 100 W.u. [17]. From comparison with the mirror nucleus, 38Ar, which has a 4480-keV 4\u2212 level with a sole transition of 670 keV connecting to the first 3\u2212\nstate, resembling the situation described here, we propose J\u03c0 = (4\u2212) for the 4191-keV state in 38Ca. The new 214- keV transition feeding the (4\u2212) level establishes a state at 4405 keV which appears to correspond to the 4586-keV 5\u2212 level in the 38Ar mirror whose far-dominant decay is a 106-keV transition to the 4\u2212. Based on mirror symmetry, a (5\u2212) assignment is proposed here for the 4405-keV level in 38Ca. This establishes (5\u2212) \u2192 (4\u2212) \u2192 (3\u22121 ) \u2192 2 + 1 as the most intense cascade seen following the 38Ca inelastic\n3 0\n0 1000 2000500 1500\n700\n400\n500\ncoinc. 489 keV\ncoinc. 214 keV\nEnergy (keV)\nCo un\nts /\n8 ke\nV\n0\n500 coinc. 1489 keV\n2213 keV\n0\n400 coinc. 2213 keV214 keV 489 keV\n1489 keV\n10 48\nk eV\n10 48\nk eV\n2213\n3684\n36 84\n3702\n4191\n4405\n21 4\n4750\n25 37\n10 48\n38Ca\n0+\n2+\n2+ (3-)\n(4-)\n(5-)\n(3-)\n14 89\n22 13\n48 9\n3084 0+\n87 1\nFIG. 3.

The width of the arrows is proportional to the \u03b3-ray intensity of the corresponding transition. The proton separation energy of Sp = 4.54727(22) MeV [19] places the second 3\u2212 state above the proton separation energy. The 0+2 state is shown but was not populated in the present work.\nscattering populated at large momentum loss. The next strongest populated level is the 2+2 state at 3684 keV for which only the transition to the ground state is observed here. A 0+ state at 4748(5) keV is claimed in 38Ca from the (3He, n) transfer reaction, however, with the suspicion of a doublet [15]. Due to the transition to the (3\u2212) state, a 0+ assignment is excluded and the level established here is tentatively assigned (3\u22122 ), consistent with the 4877-keV 3\u22122 level in the\n38Ar mirror, which also decays predominantly to the 2+1 and 3 \u2212 1 states [15].\nIt is interesting to explore which low-lying levels have not been observed in the present experiment. This is, most prominently, the 0+2 state reported at 3084 keV which would decay to the first 2+ state with a 871-keV transition [15]. There is no evidence for an appreciable presence of that transition in Figs. 2 and 3 (the 871- keV transition would be 13 keV above the background feature originating from neutron-induced background as indicated in Fig. 2).\nIn the following, we discuss the configurations of the states observed. Many properties of 40Ca and the surrounding nuclei can be interpreted relative to a doubly-\nclosed shell structure for the ground state of 40Ca with the sd shell filled and the pf shell empty. The first excited state of 40Ca has J\u03c0 = 0+ and is qualitatively associated with a four-particle four-hole (4p-4h) state relative to the 40Ca closed-shell ground state [18]. We will use \u2206, the number nucleons moved from sd to fp orbitals, to characterize the structure of the states. In this notation, the 4p-4h states in 40Ca have \u2206 = 4. (To remove spurious states, the \u2206 basis includes all components associated with the \u2206~\u03c9 basis constructed in the 0s-0p-0d1s-0f1p model space).\nIn Ref. [20], a Hamiltonian was developed for these pure \u2206 configurations. This Hamiltonian served as the starting point for the new Florida State University (FSU) Hamiltonian for pure \u2206 states [21, 22]. The A = 38, FSU results are compared to experiment in Fig. 4, the overall agreement with experiment being good. The calculated configurations can be divided into those with \u2206 = 0 with positive parity (green), those with \u2206 = 1 with negative parity (blue) and those with \u2206 = 2 with positive parity (red).\nIn the present 38Ca level scheme, the strongest \u03b3 rays come from the 2+1 state, which is predicted to be of sdshell origin, and from states with \u2206=1, including the highest J\u03c0 = 5\u2212 level possible for this \u2206. The \u03b3-ray decay of the 2+2 state is also observed. In the\n36Ar(3He, n) reaction in [23] this state is found to have a strong (f7/2) 2 form factor which would come from \u2206 = 2 configurations in the FSU spectrum. However, the 0+2 state, which also has \u2206 = 2, was not populated.\nIn the following, we propose a view that puts the pop-\n4 ulated states within the context of the observed highmomentum-loss reaction events. From the approximately 200 MeV of energy loss in the reaction, and given that the detected 38Ca are largely within laboratory scattering angles of 3-4\u25e6, about 150 MeV must be dissipated in the 9Be nuclei, with a total binding of 58 MeV. Thus, there must be disintegration of the target nucleus into a number of energetic fragments. The emerging picture is then one of multiple nucleons interacting in a single collision with the formation of complex multi-particle multi-hole configurations, in contrast to the situation in far-less-dissipative, surface-grazing collisions. We exclude scenarios where a 38Ca projectile undergoes multiple collisions within the target as an explanation for the observed cross sections. High-momentum loss events creating mp-nh excitations in such a scenario would require a sequence of knockout and/or pickup processes and such pickup mechanism cross sections are small \u2013 with a typical upper limit of 2 mb at these beam energies [24].\nConnecting to the shell-model picture, excitations within the FSU model space are described by many-body transition densities. In the simplest scenario, excitation of the \u2206 = 1 negative-parity states involve the \u2206 = 0 to \u2206 = 1 one-body transition densities (OBTD). The OBTD to those states observed are all large. The \u2206 = 2, 2+2 state involves the \u2206 = 0 to \u2206 = 2 two-body transition density (TBTD). The TBTD connecting the \u2206 = 0 and \u2206 = 2 0+ wave functions are the same ones that enter into the Hamiltonian matrix for mixing these two states. We expect that the microscopic, two-nucleon excitation mechanism should involve an operator similar to that of the two-body mixing Hamiltonian (e.g. dominated by pairing). This would explain why excitation of the 0+2 is not observed \u2013 the mixed 0 + 1 and 0 + 2 eigenfunctions are orthogonal with respect to the two-nucleon excitation operator. We note that in 40Ca(p, t) [25] the 0+2 state is only very weakly populated compared to the 2+2 state (see Fig. 1 in Ref. [25]).\nThe events at momentum losses of 600-700 MeV/c, studied here, are also reminiscent of observations in the work of Podolyak et al. [30]. There, in the two-neutron knockout from 56Fe to 54Fe at 500 MeV/nucleon, the population of a 10+ isomer of complex structure was observed in the low-momentum tail of the parallel momentum distribution at about the same absolute momentum loss. The authors attributed this population to the excitation of the \u2206(1232) resonance at their relativistic beam energies. This mechanism is not available to our intermediate-energy beams of tens of MeV/nucleon. One may speculate that the population of the complexstructure state in the two-neutron knockout from 56Fe is rather due to a simultaneous multi-nucleon rearrangement as hypothesized here, without evoking quark degrees of freedom and consistent with the reduction of multi-step processes at their relativistic energies. For example, population of the 10+ state could be due to\nthe \u2206J = 6 excitation of a (f7/2) 2 6+ configuration in 56Fe combined with the removal of two neutrons from the 1p3/2 and 0f7/2 orbitals having \u2206J \u2265 4.\nIn Ref. [16], from the high-spin spectroscopy of states up to J = 15/2 in 39Ca, we argue that such simultaneous multi-nucleon rearrangement is also at play in intermediate-energy nucleon transfer reactions, such as 9Be(38Ca \u2217 , 39Ca+\u03b3)X. Once again, these excitations are\nseen in events in the tail of the longitudinal momentum distribution at a momentum loss of 600-700 MeV/c.\nIn the present work, the specific reaction dynamics at play in the observed large momentum loss collisions are unclear and remain a challenge for future, more complete and exclusive measurements. Specifically, it would be critical to detect the dissociation of the 9Be target nuclei in the large-momentum-loss events and clarify the kinematics of the residues.\nWhile there is much to be discovered about this type of reaction, it is evident that this presents a new opportunity in the fast-beam regime which uniquely complements classic low-energy reactions, such as multi-step Coulomb excitation and multi-nucleon transfer. Fast beams allow for the use thick targets and capitalize on an increase in \u03b3-ray yield by a factor of about 4300 for the specific example of a 188-mg/cm2 9Be target used here vs. a 1-mg/cm2 Pb target often employed for multi-step Coulomb excitation, for example. Also, strong forward focusing enhances the collection efficiency as compared to low-energy reactions that fill a larger phase space.\nMulti-step Coulomb excitation studies with low-energy rare-isotope beams have been performed at beam intensities similar to those used here, but have been limited to a complementary level scheme selectively comprising cascades connected by strong E2 transitions, with at most the first 3\u2212 state [7, 26]. We illustrate this with the example of the state-of-the art low-energy Coulomb excitation of the neighboring Ca isotope 42Ca on Pb [27]. The measurement was performed at 1 pnA stable-beam intensity for 5 days (resulting in more than 110,000 times the number of Ca projectiles on target as in the present measurement) \u2013 excited states up to the 4+1,2 states were reported with no evidence for any of the negative-parity cross-shell excitations observed here.\nMulti-nucleon transfer, largely limited to stable beams at pnA beam intensities, is known to populate complexstructure states, however, without efficiently reaching 38Ca in spite of 40Ca being an often-used beam (see [28] and references within). When low-energy neutronrich beams become available at near stable-beam intensities, multi-nucleon transfer may become an alternative to access such states in selected neutron-rich nuclei [29]. While it is interesting to also extend our approach to collective nuclei, it already promises to be a unique method to probe cross-shell excitations near magic numbers, elucidating shell evolution in rare isotopes and exploring the necessary model spaces for a region\u2019s description on the\n5 quest for a predictive model of nuclei.\nIn conclusion, the in-beam \u03b3-ray spectroscopy is reported of higher-spin, complex-structure negative-parity states in 38Ca populated in highly-dissipative processes induced by a fast 38Ca projectile beam reacting with a 9Be target. This work constitutes the first highresolution \u03b3-ray spectroscopy of 38Ca with a modern HPGe \u03b3-ray tracking array. The final states observed in the inelastic scattering, 9Be(38Ca, 38Ca+\u03b3)X, at large momentum loss are characterized through their particlehole character relative to the 40Ca closed-shell ground state. Excellent agreement is obtained with shell-model calculations using the FSU cross-shell effective interaction. Based on the strongly populated negative-parity states and the non-observation of the first excited 0+2 state, we propose a consistent picture in which these multi-particle multi-hole states are formed by simultaneous rearrangement of multiple nucleons in a single, highly-dissipative collision. These reaction processes, seen here in the extreme low-momentum tail of 38Ca+9Be inelastic scattering, identify a new pathway to gain access to excited states not usually observed in fast-beam induced reactions and likely out of reach for low-energy reactions.\nThis work was supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) under Grants No. PHY-1565546 and PHY-2110365, by the DOE National Nuclear Security Administration through the Nuclear Science and Security Consortium, under Award No. DE-NA0003180, and by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Nuclear Physics, under Grants No. DE-SC0020451 (MSU) and DE-FG02-87ER-40316 (WashU) and under Contract No. DE-AC02-06CH11357 (ANL).
