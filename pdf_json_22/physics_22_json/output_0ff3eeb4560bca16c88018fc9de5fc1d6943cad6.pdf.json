The method is based on the formulation of linearized elasticity as a weighted vector Laplace problem. By introducing the solid rotation and fluid flux as auxiliary variables, we form a four-field formulation of the Biot system, which is discretized using conforming mixed finite element spaces. The auxiliary variables are subsequently removed from the system in a local hybridization technique to obtain a multipoint rotation-flux mixed finite element method. Stability and convergence of the four-field and multipoint mixed finite element methods are shown in terms of weighted norms, which additionally leads to parameter-robust preconditioners. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results.",

The cornerstone of this work is a reformulation of the linearized elasticity equations as a weighted vector-Laplacian on the displacement. The key is then to consider the mixed formulation of this problem by introducing the solid rotation as an auxiliary variable. This allows us to relieve the H1-regularity requirement that is typically placed on the displacement variable.\nRotation-based formulations of elasticity and poroelasticity were recently investigated in [8] and [7], where the displacement is sought in H1 and the rotation in L2. In contrast, we seek the displacement in the larger space H(\u2207\u00b7,\u2126) and the rotation in the smaller space H(\u2207\u00d7,\u2126). In turn, our variational problem requires its own, distinct a priori analysis and leads to a different choice of the finite element spaces.\nAn important advantage of the four-field formulation we consider is that it allows for mass-lumping techniques that are common to multipoint mixed finite element methods. The primary example of these methods is the multipoint flux mixed finite element method (MF-MFEM) [20]. The method, traditionally employed for elliptic problems such as Darcy\u2019s flow, employs the Brezzi-Douglas-Marini [11] space to model the Darcy flux and introduces a low-order quadrature rule on its inner product to obtain an approximation of the mass matrix that is easily invertible. In turn, the flux variable can be eliminated locally, leading to a scheme with cell-centered pressures that is closely related to the multipoint flux approximation (MPFA) finite volume method [2].\nThe MF-MFEM was extended to the case of linearized elasticity as the multipoint stress MFEM (MS-MFEM) [4], which has in turn been applied to the Biot equations [5] and Stokes flow [12]. From the perspective of exterior calculus, these hybridization techniques were recognized as a way to compute local coderivatives and subsequently generalized to a larger class of mixed finite element spaces [14]. Based on these results, the multipoint vorticity MFEM (MV-MFEM ) was recently developed for a\n\u2217Submitted to the editors DATE.

The similarities between the Stokes and the Biot equations were used in [19] to construct stabilized mixed finite element discretizations. Through a similar observation, we herein extend MV-MFEM for Stokes [10] to a multipoint rotation mixed finite element method (MR-MFEM ) for linearized elasticity and poroelasticity. As mentioned before, we obtain the MR-MFEM from a rotation-based formulation of elasticity. It therefore employs the Raviart-Thomas (RT0) space for the solid displacement, as opposed to piecewise constants (Pn0 ) in MS-MFEM. The coupling with fluid flow in a poroelastic setting is then naturally incorporated because the divergence of the displacement is well-defined on RT0.\nThe paper is organized as follows. First, the conventions concerning notation are introduced in Subsection 1.1 and the model problem is presented in Section 2. The ensuing sections contain the main contributions of this work, which are as follows:\n\u2022 Well-posedness analysis of a rotation-based, four-field formulation of poroelasticity with the solid rotation in H(\u2207\u00d7,\u2126) and displacement in H(\u2207\u00b7,\u2126), using parameter-weighted norms (Section 3). \u2022 Stability and convergence analysis of two families of mixed finite elements that conform to the four-field formulation (Section 4). \u2022 A stable and convergent multipoint rotation-flux mixed finite element method for the Biot equations that employs the RT0 \u00d7 P0 pair for the solid displacement and fluid pressure (Section 5). \u2022 Parameter-robust preconditioners for the mixed finite element methods based on the analysis in weighted norms (Section 6). \u2022 Numerical experiments that confirm the convergence of the methods and robustness of the preconditioner (Section 7).\nConcluding remarks are given in Section 8.\n1.1. Preliminaries and notation. Let \u2126 \u2282 Rn be a contractible, Lipschitz domain with n \u2208 {2, 3}. Let L2(\u2126) be the space of square integrable functions on \u2126 and let its inner product be denoted by \u3008\u00b7, \u00b7\u3009\u2126. The space L2(\u2126) is endowed with the norm \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016 := \u221a \u3008\u00b7, \u00b7\u3009\u2126. We apply the same notation for the inner product and norm of square-integrable vector functions in (L2(\u2126))n. Let H(\u2207\u00b7,\u2126) be the subspace of (L2(\u2126))n that contains functions with square integrable divergence. Let \u2207\u00d7 denote the conventional curl operator in 3D. Note that for n = 2, we simply have that \u2207\u00d7 r := (\u2212\u22022r, \u22021r) and \u2207\u00d7 u := \u22022u1 \u2212 \u22021u2 for sufficiently regular scalar fields r and vector fields u. In turn, let H(\u2207\u00d7,\u2126) be the subspace of (L2(\u2126))kn , with kn := ( n 2 ), consisting of functions with square integrable curl. For a Hilbert space X, let X \u2032 denote its dual, and the corresponding duality pairing is given by \u3008\u00b7, \u00b7\u3009X\u2032\u00d7X . For notational brevity, we omit the subscript on duality pairings since it can be deduced from context. Given an operator A : Z \u2192 Y and a subspace X \u2286 Z, let A|X be the restriction of A on X. We denote the kernel and range of the restriction by Ker(A,X) := Ker(A|X) and Ran(A,X) := Ran(A|X), respectively.\nFor a, b \u2208 R, the notation a . b implies that a constant C > 0 exists, independent of material or discretization parameters, such that Ca \u2264 b. However, the constant C may depend on the domain \u2126 and on the shape-regularity of the mesh. We use & analogously and a h b if and only if a . b . a.\n2. Model Problem. We start in Subsection 2.1 with linear elasticity to highlight the manipulation of the system that lies at the heart of the proposed numerical\nmethods. The coupling to flow is introduced afterward in Subsection 2.2.\n2.1. Linearized elasticity as a weighted vector-Laplacian. Let us consider the governing equations of linearized elasticity in terms of the Cauchy stress \u03c3 and displacement u:\n\u03c3 = 2\u00b5\u03b5(u) + (\u03bb\u2207 \u00b7 u)I, \u2212\u2207 \u00b7 \u03c3 = fu.(2.1)\nHere, \u00b5 and \u03bb are the Lame\u0301 parameters, fu is a body force, \u03b5 is the symmetric gradient and I \u2208 Rn\u00d7n the identity tensor. We reformulate these equations by recalling the following calculus identity:\n\u2212\u2207 \u00b7 \u03b5(u) = 1 2 \u2207\u00d7 (\u2207\u00d7 u)\u2212\u2207(\u2207 \u00b7 u).(2.2)\nWe substitute this identity and the definition of \u03c3 in the momentum balance equation and assume spatially constant \u00b5 to obtain\n\u2207\u00d7 (\u00b5\u2207\u00d7 u)\u2212\u2207(2\u00b5+ \u03bb)\u2207 \u00b7 u = fu(2.3)\nWe now define the rotation variable r := \u00b5\u2207 \u00d7 u, which leads us to the strong form of our 2-field formulation for linear elasticity in terms of (r, u):\n\u00b5\u22121r \u2212\u2207\u00d7 u = 0, \u2207\u00d7 r \u2212\u2207(2\u00b5+ \u03bb)\u2207 \u00b7 u = fu.(2.4a)\nsubject to the boundary conditions\n\u03bd \u00b7 u = 0, \u03bd \u00d7 r = 0, on \u2202r\u2126, \u03bd \u00d7 u = \u03bd \u00d7 u0, (2\u00b5+ \u03bb) Tr \u03b5(u) = \u03c30, on \u2202u\u2126. (2.4b)\nHere, \u2202r\u2126\u222a \u2202u\u2126 is a disjoint decomposition of the boundary \u2202\u2126 and \u03bd is its outward oriented, unit normal vector. To ensure uniqueness, we assume that the boundary decomposition is such that \u2016\u03bd \u00b7 \u03c6\u2016\u2202r\u2126 + \u2016\u03bd \u00d7 \u03c6\u2016\u2202u\u2126 > 0 for all non-zero rigid body motions \u03c6.\nTo derive the variational formulation of (2.4), we introduce the following Hilbert spaces in which to seek the rotation and displacement variables:\nR := {r \u2208 H(\u2207\u00d7,\u2126) | \u03bd \u00d7 r = 0 on \u2202r\u2126} , U := {u \u2208 H(\u2207\u00b7,\u2126) | \u03bd \u00b7 u = 0 on \u2202r\u2126} . (2.5)\nBy introducing test functions (r\u0303, u\u0303) \u2208 R \u00d7 U and using integration by parts, we obtain the variational formulation: find (r\u0303, u\u0303) \u2208 R\u00d7 U such that\n\u3008\u00b5\u22121r, r\u0303\u3009\u2126 \u2212 \u3008u,\u2207\u00d7 r\u0303\u3009\u2126 = \u3008u0, \u03bd \u00d7 r\u0303\u3009\u2202u\u2126, \u2200r\u0303 \u2208 R, \u3008\u2207 \u00d7 r, u\u0303\u3009\u2126 + \u3008(2\u00b5+ \u03bb)\u2207 \u00b7 u,\u2207 \u00b7 u\u0303\u3009\u2126 = \u3008fu, u\u0303\u3009\u2126 \u2212 \u3008\u03c30, \u03bd \u00b7 u\u0303\u3009\u2202u\u2126, \u2200u\u0303 \u2208 U. (2.6)\nRemark 2.1. The boundary conditions in (2.4) do not immediately translate into classical boundary conditions such as clamped boundaries, i.e. u = 0 on \u2202\u2126. We refer to [9] for techniques that handle this case.\n2.2. Coupling to porous medium flow. Next, we consider the setting of a poroelastic medium in which fluid flow and solid mechanics form a fully coupled system known as the quasi-steady Biot equations:\n\u03c3 = 2\u00b5\u03b5(u) + (\u03bb\u2207 \u00b7 u\u2212 \u03b1p)I, \u2212\u2207 \u00b7 \u03c3 = fu, q\u030c = \u2212K\u2207p, \u2202t(c0p+ \u03b1\u2207 \u00b7 u) +\u2207 \u00b7 q\u030c = f\u030cp, (2.7)\nwith q\u030c the Darcy flux and p the fluid pressure. Moreover, K is the hydraulic conductivity, c0 the specific storativity, and \u03b1 is the Biot-Willis constant.\nUsing the same steps as in Subsection 2.1, we rewrite the elasticity equations in terms of rotation and displacement. As time discretization, we choose an implicit method such as the backward Euler or Crank-Nicolson scheme with time step \u2206t.\nIn order to obtain an advantageous scaling with the time step, we introduce the scaled Darcy flux q := \u03b4q\u030c, with \u03b4 := \u221a \u2206t. Different scalings of q\u030c are possible, but may result in systems that either do not have favorable symmetries, which complicates the analysis, or contain negative powers of \u2206t, which can be undesirable in the case of small time steps.\nBy including quantities relative to the previous time step in the right-hand side fp, we obtain the semi-discrete, four-field formulation of the Biot equations: \u00b5\u22121 \u2212\u2207\u00d7 \u2207\u00d7 \u2212\u2207(2\u00b5+ \u03bb)\u2207\u00b7 \u2207\u03b1\nK\u22121 \u03b4\u2207 \u03b1\u2207\u00b7 \u2207 \u00b7 \u03b4 c0   r u q p  =  0 fu 0 fp  ,(2.8a) subject to the boundary conditions\n\u03bd \u00b7 u = 0, \u03bd \u00d7 r = 0, on \u2202r\u2126, \u03bd \u00d7 u = \u03bd \u00d7 u0, (2\u00b5+ \u03bb) Tr \u03b5(u)\u2212 \u03b1p = \u03c30, on \u2202u\u2126,\np = p0, on \u2202p\u2126, \u03bd \u00b7 q = 0, on \u2202q\u2126. (2.8b)\nWe assume that \u2202p\u2126 \u222a \u2202q\u2126 forms a disjoint decomposition of the boundary with |\u2202p\u2126| > 0. To facilitate the analysis in the next section, we define the following Hilbert spaces for the fluid flux and pressure:\nQ := {q \u2208 H(\u2207\u00b7,\u2126) | \u03bd \u00b7 q = 0 on \u2202q\u2126} , P := L2(\u2126).(2.9)\n3. Analysis of the semi-discrete problem. We continue by constructing and analyzing the variational formulation of system (2.8), which is continuous in space and discrete in time. As short-hand notation, we will use x := (r, u, q, p) and x\u0303 := (r\u0303, u\u0303, q\u0303, p\u0303) belonging to the Hilbert space:\nX := R\u00d7 U \u00d7Q\u00d7 P,(3.1)\nwith the spaces R,U defined in (2.5) and Q,P in (2.9). For simplicity, let all material parameters be homogenous in space and we moreover assume that the conductivity K is isotropic and thus given by a positive scalar. To highlight the structure of the system, we define the operators A : X \u2192 X \u2032 and B : X \u2192 X \u2032 and the functional f \u2208 X \u2032 as follows:\n\u3008Ax, x\u0303\u3009 := \u00b5\u22121\u3008r, r\u0303\u3009\u2126 + (2\u00b5+ \u03bb)\u3008\u2207 \u00b7 u,\u2207 \u00b7 u\u0303\u3009\u2126 +K\u22121\u3008q, q\u0303\u3009\u2126 + c0\u3008p, p\u0303\u3009\u2126, \u3008Bx, x\u0303\u3009 := \u3008\u2207 \u00d7 r, u\u0303\u3009\u2126 + \u3008\u2207 \u00b7 (\u03b1u+ \u03b4q), p\u0303\u3009\u2126, \u3008f, x\u0303\u3009 := \u3008u0, \u03bd \u00d7 r\u0303\u3009\u2202u\u2126 + \u3008fu, u\u0303\u3009\u2126 \u2212 \u3008\u03c30, \u03bd \u00b7 u\u0303\u3009\u2202u\u2126 \u2212 \u3008p0, \u03bd \u00b7 \u03b4q\u0303\u3009\u2202p\u2126 + \u3008fp, p\u0303\u3009\u2126.\nLet the compound operator A : X \u2192 X \u2032 be such that\nA := A+B \u2212B\u2217,(3.2)\nwith B\u2217 : X \u2192 X \u2032 the adjoint of B defined by \u3008B\u2217x, x\u0303\u3009 := \u3008Bx\u0303, x\u3009. The variational formulation of (2.8) is then given by: find x \u2208 X such that\n\u3008Ax, x\u0303\u3009 = \u3008f, x\u0303\u3009, \u2200x\u0303 \u2208 X.(3.3)\nBased on the scaling in the operator A, we endow X with the following parameterdependent norm:\n\u2016x\u20162X := \u00b5\u22121(\u2016r\u20162 + \u2016\u2207 \u00d7 r\u20162) + \u00b5\u2016u\u20162 + (2\u00b5+ \u03bb)\u2016\u2207 \u00b7 u\u20162\n+K\u22121\u2016q\u20162 + \u03b4 2\n\u03b7 + c0 \u2016\u2207 \u00b7 q\u20162 + (\u03b7 + c0)\u2016p\u20162.(3.4)\n3Here, \u03b7 := \u03b1 2\n2\u00b5+\u03bb + \u03b4 2K is a scaling parameter particularly chosen for the ensuing\nanalysis. In order for these norms to be well-defined, we assume that \u00b5, \u03bb, K, and (\u03b7 + c0) are positive. However, we do not explicitly bound these parameters away from zero, so that we do not rely on small, lower bounds in our analysis.\nIt is convenient to analyze problem (3.3) using an equivalent energy norm, which we introduce in the following lemma.\nLemma 3.1 (Energy norm). Let \u03a0 be the L2-projection onto Ran(\u2207\u00d7, R) and let the energy norm be given by\n|||x|||2 := \u00b5\u22121(\u2016r\u20162 + \u2016\u2207 \u00d7 r\u20162) + \u00b5\u2016\u03a0u\u20162 + (2\u00b5+ \u03bb)\u2016\u2207 \u00b7 u\u20162\n+K\u22121\u2016q\u20162 + 1 \u03b7 + c0 \u2016\u2207 \u00b7 (\u03b1u+ \u03b4q)\u20162 + (\u03b7 + c0)\u2016p\u20162.(3.5)\nThen the following equivalence holds:\n\u2016x\u2016X h |||x|||, \u2200x \u2208 X.(3.6)\nProof. Let us consider the lower bound \u201c&\u201d. We first show that \u2016u\u2016 & \u2016\u03a0u\u2016 follows immediately from the L2-orthogonality of \u03a0:\n\u2016u\u20162 = \u2016\u03a0u\u20162 + \u2016(I \u2212\u03a0)u\u20162 \u2265 \u2016\u03a0u\u20162.(3.7a)\nSecondly, we consider the norms on the divergence terms. The triangle-type inequality \u2016a+ b\u20162 \u2264 2(\u2016a\u20162 + \u2016b\u20162) and the lower bound \u03b7 + c0 \u2265 \u03b1 2\n2\u00b5+\u03bb yield\n1\n\u03b7 + c0 \u2016\u2207 \u00b7 (\u03b1u+ \u03b4q)\u20162 \u2264 2\n( \u03b12\n\u03b7 + c0 \u2016\u2207 \u00b7 u\u20162 + \u03b4\n2\n\u03b7 + c0 \u2016\u2207 \u00b7 q\u20162 ) \u2264 2 ( (2\u00b5+ \u03bb)\u2016\u2207 \u00b7 u\u20162 + \u03b4 2\n\u03b7 + c0 \u2016\u2207 \u00b7 q\u20162\n) .(3.7b)\nCollecting (3.7), we conclude \u2016x\u2016X & |||x|||. For the upper bound \u201c.\u201d, we once again first bound the norm \u2016u\u2016. The Poincare\u0301 inequality implies that a \u03b1u > 0 exists such that\n\u03b1u\u2016u\u2016 \u2264 \u2016\u2207 \u00b7 u\u2016, \u2200u \u22a5 Ker(\u2207\u00b7, U).\nSince \u2126 is contractible, we have Ker(\u2207\u00b7, U) = Ran(\u2207\u00d7, R) and we use the Poincare\u0301 inequality to derive\n\u00b5\u2016u\u20162 \u2264 \u00b5\u2016\u03a0u\u20162 + 1 \u03b12u \u00b5\u2016\u2207 \u00b7 ((I \u2212\u03a0)u)\u20162\n= \u00b5\u2016\u03a0u\u20162 + 1 \u03b12u \u00b5\u2016\u2207 \u00b7 u\u20162\n\u2264 max { 1\n2\u03b12u , 1\n}( \u00b5\u2016\u03a0u\u20162 + (2\u00b5+ \u03bb)\u2016\u2207 \u00b7 u\u20162 ) .(3.8a)\nIt remains to show a bound on the divergence terms. Using the same triangle-type inequality and lower bound on \u03b7 + c0 as in (3.7b), we derive\n1 \u03b7 + c0 \u2016\u2207 \u00b7 (\u03b1u+ \u03b4q)\u20162 \u2265 1 \u03b7 + c0\n( 1\n2 \u2016\u2207 \u00b7 \u03b4q\u20162 \u2212 \u2016\u2207 \u00b7 \u03b1u\u20162 ) \u2265 1\n2\n\u03b42\n\u03b7 + c0 \u2016\u2207 \u00b7 q\u20162 \u2212 (2\u00b5+ \u03bb)\u2016\u2207 \u00b7 u\u20162.\nFrom this result, we deduce\n(2\u00b5+ \u03bb)\u2016\u2207 \u00b7 u\u20162 + 1 \u03b7 + c0 \u2016\u2207 \u00b7 (\u03b1u+ \u03b4q)\u20162\n\u2265 (2\u00b5+ \u03bb)\u2016\u2207 \u00b7 u\u20162 + 2 3 1 \u03b7 + c0 \u2016\u2207 \u00b7 (\u03b1u+ \u03b4q)\u20162\n\u2265 1 3\n( (2\u00b5+ \u03bb)\u2016\u2207 \u00b7 u\u20162 + \u03b4 2\n\u03b7 + c0 \u2016\u2207 \u00b7 q\u20162\n) .(3.8b)\nCollecting (3.8), we have \u2016x\u2016X . |||x||| and the result follows. With the energy norm defined by (3.5), we are now ready to prove the key prerequisites for well-posedness of (3.3), namely the continuity and inf-sup conditions on A.\nLemma 3.2 (Continuity). The operator A : X \u2192 X \u2032 is continuous:\n\u2016Ax\u2016 := sup x\u0303\u2208X \u3008Ax, x\u0303\u3009 \u2016x\u0303\u2016X . \u2016x\u2016X , \u2200x \u2208 X.(3.9)\nProof. First, we apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to each of the terms, e.g.\n\u00b5\u22121\u3008r, r\u0303\u3009\u2126 \u2264 \u00b5\u22121\u2016r\u2016\u2016r\u0303\u2016, \u3008\u2207 \u00d7 r, u\u0303\u3009\u2126 = \u3008\u2207 \u00d7 r,\u03a0u\u0303\u3009\u2126 \u2264 1 \u221a \u00b5 \u2016r\u2016\u221a\u00b5\u2016\u03a0u\u0303\u2016.\nAfter summing all products, we use the Cauchy-Schwarz once more to conclude that \u3008Ax, x\u0303\u3009 . |||x||| |||x\u0303|||. The result in \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016X follows from the norm equivalence shown in Lemma 3.1.\nLemma 3.3 (Inf-sup). The operator A is bounded from below as\n\u2016Ax\u2016 & \u2016x\u2016X , \u2200x \u2208 X.(3.10)\nProof. We aim to show that, for given x \u2208 X, a test function x\u0303 \u2208 X exists with the properties\n\u3008Ax, x\u0303\u3009 & |||x|||2, |||x\u0303||| . |||x|||.(3.11)\nThe equivalence from Lemma 3.1 will then provide the result in the norm \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016X . We construct this test function explicitly in four parts. First, let x\u03030 := x = (r, u, q, p) for which we derive\n\u3008Ax, x\u03030\u3009 = \u3008Ax, x\u3009 = \u00b5\u22121\u2016r\u20162 + (2\u00b5+ \u03bb)\u2016\u2207 \u00b7 u\u20162 +K\u22121\u2016q\u20162 + c0\u2016p\u20162.(3.12)\nThe second test function we consider is given by x\u03031 := (0, \u00b5 \u22121\u2207 \u00d7 r, 0, 1\u03b70+c0\u2207 \u00b7 (\u03b1u+ \u03b4q)) with \u03b70 \u2265 0 to be chosen later. Using the orthogonality \u2207 \u00b7 \u2207\u00d7 r = 0, we derive using the Cauchy-Schwarz and Young\u2019s inequality:\n\u3008Ax, x\u03031\u3009 = \u00b5\u22121\u2016\u2207 \u00d7 r\u20162 + 1 \u03b70 + c0 \u2016\u2207 \u00b7 (\u03b1u+ \u03b4q)\u20162 + \u3008 c0 \u03b70 + c0 p,\u2207 \u00b7 (\u03b1u+ \u03b4q)\u3009\u2126\n\u2265 \u00b5\u22121\u2016\u2207 \u00d7 r\u20162 + 1 \u03b70 + c0 \u2016\u2207 \u00b7 (\u03b1u+ \u03b4q)\u20162 \u2212 \u2016p\u2016\u2016\u2207 \u00b7 (\u03b1u+ \u03b4q)\u2016 \u2265 \u00b5\u22121\u2016\u2207 \u00d7 r\u20162 + 1 2(\u03b70 + c0) \u2016\u2207 \u00b7 (\u03b1u+ \u03b4q)\u20162 \u2212 \u03b70 + c0 2 \u2016p\u20162.(3.13)\nThe last two components are constructed by exploiting the inf-sup conditions on the operators that compose B. The first of these implies that a \u03b2r > 0 exists such that for each u \u2208 U , there exists a r\u0303u \u2208 R with\n\u2207\u00d7 r\u0303u = \u03a0u, \u03b2r ( \u2016r\u0303u\u20162 + \u2016\u2207 \u00d7 r\u0303u\u20162 ) \u2264 \u2016\u03a0u\u20162.\nWe use r\u0303u to define x\u03032 := (\u2212\u03b2r\u00b5r\u0303u, 0, 0, 0). The Cauchy-Schwarz and Young inequalities give us:\n\u3008Ax, x\u03032\u3009 = \u03b2r\u00b5\u2016\u03a0u\u20162 \u2212 \u03b2r\u3008r, r\u0303u\u3009\u2126\n\u2265 \u03b2r\u00b5\u2016\u03a0u\u20162 \u2212 1\n2\n( \u00b5\u22121\u2016r\u20162 + \u03b22r\u00b5\u2016r\u0303u\u20162 ) \u2265 \u03b2r\n2 \u00b5\u2016\u03a0u\u20162 \u2212 1 2 \u00b5\u22121\u2016r\u20162(3.14)\nThe final test function is constructed similarly. Two constants \u03b2u, \u03b2q > 0 exist such that for each p \u2208 P , there exists a pair (u\u0303p, q\u0303p) \u2208 U \u00d7Q with the properties\n\u2207 \u00b7 u\u0303p = p, \u03a0u\u0303p = 0, \u03b2u ( \u2016u\u0303p\u20162 + \u2016\u2207 \u00b7 u\u0303p\u20162 ) \u2264 \u2016p\u20162,\n\u2207 \u00b7 q\u0303p = p, \u03a0q\u0303p = 0, \u03b2q ( \u2016q\u0303p\u20162 + \u2016\u2207 \u00b7 q\u0303p\u20162 ) \u2264 \u2016p\u20162\nThese allow us to define x\u03033 := (0,\u2212 \u03b12\u00b5+\u03bb u\u0303p,\u2212\u03b2q\u03b4Kq\u0303p, 0). Let us use the short-hand notation \u03b70 := 1 2 ( \u03b12 2\u00b5+\u03bb + \u03b2q\u03b4 2K ) .

It remains to show that x\u0303 is bounded. Clearly, we have |||x\u03030||| = |||x|||, so we continue with the bounds for the remaining xi:\n|||x\u03031|||2 = \u00b5\u2016\u00b5\u22121\u2207\u00d7 r\u20162 + \u03b7 + c0\n(\u03b70 + c0)2 \u2016\u2207 \u00b7 (\u03b1u+ \u03b4q)\u20162\n. \u00b5\u22121\u2016\u2207 \u00d7 r\u20162 + 1 \u03b7 + c0 \u2016\u2207 \u00b7 (\u03b1u+ \u03b4q)\u20162 \u2264 |||x|||2\n|||x\u03032|||2 = \u00b5\u03b22r (\u2016r\u0303u\u20162 + \u2016\u2207 \u00d7 r\u0303u\u20162) . \u00b5\u2016\u03a0u\u20162 \u2264 |||x||| 2 |||x\u03033|||2 = \u03b12\n2\u00b5+ \u03bb \u2016p\u20162 + \u03b22q \u03b42K\u2016q\u0303p\u20162 +\n1\n\u03b7 + c0 \u20162\u03b70p\u20162\n. \u03b7\u2016p\u20162 \u2264 |||x|||2.\n(3.17)\nCollecting (3.17), we have |||x\u0303||| . |||x|||. Together with (3.16), we have shown (3.11) and the result follows by Lemma 3.1.\nTheorem 3.4 (Well-posedness). Problem (3.3) admits a unique solution x \u2208 X that satisfies\n\u2016x\u2016X . \u2016f\u2016X\u2032 := sup x\u0303\u2208X \u3008f, x\u0303\u3009 \u2016x\u0303\u2016X .(3.18)\nProof. We aim to utilize the Babus\u030cka-Lax-Milgram theorem. For this, we need to show that for each x \u2208 X, a x\u0303 \u2208 X exists such that \u3008Ax\u0303, x\u3009 > 0. The symmetries of A allow us to write:\n\u3008Ax\u0303, x\u3009 = \u3008A(r\u0303, u\u0303, q\u0303, p\u0303), (r, u, q, p)\u3009 = \u3008A(r,\u2212u,\u2212q, p), (r\u0303,\u2212u\u0303,\u2212q\u0303, p\u0303)\u3009(3.19)\nIn turn, we use Lemma 3.3 to construct x\u0303 such that \u3008Ax\u0303, x\u3009 & \u2016x\u2016X > 0. Combining (3.19) with Lemmas 3.2 and 3.3, we invoke the Babus\u030cka-Lax-Milgram theorem to conclude that a unique solution exists that satisfies (3.18)\nCorollary 3.5. The elasticity problem (2.6) admits a unique solution (r, u) \u2208 R\u00d7 U that is bounded in the norm\n\u2016(r, u)\u20162R\u00d7U := \u00b5\u22121(\u2016r\u20162 + \u2016\u2207 \u00d7 r\u20162) + \u00b5\u2016u\u20162 + (2\u00b5+ \u03bb)\u2016\u2207 \u00b7 u\u20162.(3.20)\nProof. Let \u03b1 = 0, then the system (3.3) decouples into the elasticity problem (2.6) and a Darcy flow problem. If we neglect the Darcy problem, then Theorem 3.4 gives us that the unique solution x is bounded in the norm \u2016x\u2016X = \u2016(r, u, 0, 0)\u2016X = \u2016(r, u)\u2016R\u00d7U .\n4. Conforming four-field MFE discretization. In this section, we introduce a conforming mixed finite element discretization of the four-field formulation (3.3). Let \u2126h be a shape-regular, simplicial tesselation of the domain \u2126. We define the discrete space Xh := Rh \u00d7 Uh \u00d7Qh \u00d7 Ph such that the following assumptions hold\nA1. The finite element spaces are conforming, i.e. Xh \u2282 X. A2. The pairs Qh \u00d7 Ph and Uh \u00d7 Ph satisfy\nRan(\u2207\u00b7, Qh) = Ran(\u2207\u00b7, Uh) = Ph\nand are inf-sup stable for the mixed formulation of the Poisson equation, i.e.\nsup q\u0303h\u2208Qh \u3008\u2207 \u00b7 q\u0303h, ph\u3009\u2126 \u2016q\u0303h\u2016+ \u2016\u2207 \u00b7 q\u0303h\u2016 & \u2016ph\u2016, sup u\u0303h\u2208Uh \u3008\u2207 \u00b7 u\u0303h, ph\u3009\u2126 \u2016u\u0303h\u2016+ \u2016\u2207 \u00b7 u\u0303h\u2016 & \u2016ph\u2016, \u2200ph \u2208 Ph.\nA3. The pair Rh \u00d7 Uh satisfies Ran(\u2207\u00d7, Rh) = Ker(\u2207\u00b7, Uh) and\nsup r\u0303h\u2208Rh \u3008\u2207 \u00d7 r\u0303h, uh\u3009\u2126 \u2016r\u0303h\u2016+ \u2016\u2207 \u00d7 r\u0303h\u2016 & \u2016uh\u2016, \u2200uh \u2208 Uh.\nRemark 4.1. Assumptions A2 and A3 can be relaxed to general inf-sup stable pairs of finite elements that do not satisfy Ran(\u2207\u00b7, Qh) \u2286 Ph, Ran(\u2207\u00b7, Uh) \u2286 Ph, and Ran(\u2207\u00d7, Rh) \u2286 Uh. However, in order to ease the upcoming analysis, we consider these stronger assumptions.\nRemark 4.2. These assumptions are different from the Stokes-Biot stability conditions introduced in [19, Def. 3.1] since we do note require a Stokes-stable pair Uh \u00d7 Ph. On the other hand, we need the additional space Rh to capture the solid rotations.\nWe focus on two families of discretizations that satisfy these assumptions. For given polynomial degree k \u2265 0, the first of these families is given by\nX (1) h := ( N(1)k \u00d7 RTk \u00d7 RTk \u00d7 Pk ) \u2229X.(4.1)\nIn particular, the rotation variable is discretized using Ne\u0301de\u0301lec elements of the first kind [17]. Here, k denotes the polynomial degree of the tangential traces on mesh edges. The displacement and fluid flux are both discretized using Raviart-Thomas elements of order k, which implies that the normal traces of these functions on mesh faces are of polynomial degree k. Finally, the pressure variable is sought in the space of discontinuous, elementwise polynomials of degree k. The intersection with X ensures that the essential boundary conditions are respected.\nThe second family we consider is defined as:\nX (2) h := ( N(2)k+1 \u00d7 RTk \u00d7 BDMk+1 \u00d7 Pk ) \u2229X.(4.2)\nIn this case, the Ne\u0301de\u0301lec elements of the second kind are used to discretize the rotation variable. The notation N(2)k+1 implies that the basis functions of Rh are given by polynomials of degree k + 1 on the mesh edges. Similarly, the fluid flux is here given by the Brezzi-Douglas-Marini space BDMk+1 which has normal traces on mesh faces of polynomial degree k + 1.\nIn 2D, since rotation is a scalar, the two families of discrete spaces employ the continuous Lagrange elements of order k + 1 for the rotation space Rh, denoted by Lk+1.\nWith the discrete space Xh \u2282 X defined, we are ready to formulate the four-field mixed finite element method (4F-MFEM): find xh \u2208 Xh such that\n\u3008Axh, x\u0303h\u3009 = \u3008f, x\u0303h\u3009, \u2200x\u0303h \u2208 Xh.(4.3)\nThe two main results are presented next, namely the stability of the 4F-MFEM in Subsection 4.1 and its convergence in Subsection 4.2.\n4.1. Stability. The analysis of (4.3) follows the same steps as in Section 3. First, the continuity bound \u3008Axh, x\u0303h\u3009 . \u2016xh\u2016X\u2016x\u0303h\u2016X , \u2200xh, x\u0303h \u2208 Xh is immediate by Lemma 3.2 and the conformity A1. The inf-sup condition is considered in the following lemma.\nLemma 4.1 (Inf-sup). If Xh satisfies A1\u2013A3, then the following bound holds\nsup x\u0303h\u2208Xh \u3008Axh, x\u0303h\u3009 \u2016x\u0303h\u2016X & \u2016xh\u2016X , \u2200xh \u2208 Xh.(4.4)\nProof. First, we define the discrete analogue of the energy norm (3.5) as\n|||xh|||2h := \u00b5 \u22121(\u2016rh\u20162 + \u2016\u2207 \u00d7 rh\u20162) + \u00b5\u2016\u03a0huh\u20162 + (2\u00b5+ \u03bb)\u2016\u2207 \u00b7 uh\u20162\n+K\u22121\u2016qh\u20162 + 1\n\u03b7 + c0 \u2016\u2207 \u00b7 (\u03b1uh + \u03b4qh)\u20162 + (\u03b7 + c0)\u2016ph\u20162.(4.5)\nwith \u03a0h the L 2-projection on Ran(\u2207\u00d7, Rh). The equivalence \u2016xh\u2016X h |||xh|||h holds for all xh \u2208 Xh by the same arguments as in Lemma 3.1, using A1 and Ker(\u2207\u00b7, Uh) = Ran(\u2207\u00d7, Rh) from assumption A3.\nNext, we follow the proof of Lemma 3.3 for a discrete function xh \u2208 Xh and \u03a0 replaced by \u03a0h. Each of the test functions x\u0303h,i \u2208 Xh can be created in analogy to x\u0303i due to assumptions A2 and A3. Thus, defining x\u0303h := \u2211 i x\u0303h,i, we have \u3008Axh, x\u0303h\u3009 & |||xh|||2h and |||x\u0303h|||h . |||xh|||h. The equivalence of norms then provides the result. The stability of the mixed finite element method, which forms the main result of this section, now follows by the same arguments as in Theorem 3.4.\nTheorem 4.2 (Stability). If assumptions A1\u2013A3 are satisfied, then the discrete problem (4.3) admits a unique solution xh \u2208 Xh that satisfies\n\u2016xh\u2016X . \u2016f\u2016X\u2032h := sup x\u0303h\u2208Xh \u3008f, x\u0303h\u3009 \u2016x\u0303h\u2016X .(4.6)\n4.2. Convergence. Let \u03a0R, \u03a0U , \u03a0Q, and \u03a0P be the canonical interpolation operators onto the respective finite element spaces, defined for sufficiently regular (r, u, q, p) \u2208 X. These operators have the following approximation properties for the finite element families X\n(1) h and X (2) h from (4.1) and (4.2):\n\u2016(I \u2212\u03a0R)r\u2016 . hk\u0304+1\u2016r\u2016k\u0304+1, \u2016\u2207 \u00d7 (I \u2212\u03a0R)r\u2016 . hk+1\u2016\u2207 \u00d7 r\u2016k+1, \u2016(I \u2212\u03a0U )u\u2016 . hk+1\u2016u\u2016k+1, \u2016\u2207 \u00b7 (I \u2212\u03a0U )u\u2016 . hk+1\u2016\u2207 \u00b7 u\u2016k+1,\n\u2016(I \u2212\u03a0Q)q\u2016 . hk\u0304+1\u2016q\u2016k\u0304+1, \u2016\u2207 \u00b7 (I \u2212\u03a0Q)q\u2016 . hk+1\u2016\u2207 \u00b7 q\u2016k+1, \u2016(I \u2212\u03a0P )p\u2016 . hk+1\u2016p\u2016k+1.\nHere, \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016k denotes the Hk(\u2126)-norm and we have k\u0304 = k for Xh := X(1)h and k\u0304 = k+ 1 for Xh := X (2) h . Let the composite interpolant \u03a0X be defined for sufficiently regular elements of X such that\n\u03a0X(r, u, q, p) := (\u03a0Rr,\u03a0Uu,\u03a0Qq,\u03a0P p).(4.7)\nTheorem 4.3 (Error estimate). If x, the solution to (3.3), is sufficiently regular,\nand Xh is chosen as X (1) h or X (2) h with polynomial degree k \u2265 0, then the solution xh \u2208 Xh to (4.3) converges as\n\u2016xh \u2212 x\u2016X \u2264 Chk+1 ( hk\u0304\u2212k\u2016r\u2016k\u0304+1 + \u2016\u2207 \u00d7 r\u2016k+1 + \u2016u\u2016k+1 + \u2016\u2207 \u00b7 u\u2016k+1\n+ hk\u0304\u2212k\u2016q\u2016k\u0304+1 + \u2016\u2207 \u00b7 q\u2016k+1 + \u2016p\u2016k+1 ) ,(4.8)\nwith C \u2265 0 possibly depending on the material parameters. Proof. As shown in the proof of Lemma 4.1, for each yh \u2208 Xh, a y\u0303h exists such that \u3008Ayh, y\u0303h\u3009 & \u2016yh\u20162X and \u2016y\u0303h\u2016X . \u2016yh\u2016X . Consider yh = xh \u2212\u03a0Xx \u2208 Xh and let us use the properties of y\u0303h with the consistency Xh \u2282 X and continuity of A from Lemma 3.2 to derive\n\u2016xh \u2212\u03a0Xx\u20162X . \u3008A(xh \u2212\u03a0Xx), y\u0303h\u3009 = \u3008A(x\u2212\u03a0Xx), y\u0303h\u3009 . \u2016(I \u2212\u03a0X)x\u2016X\u2016xh \u2212\u03a0Xx\u2016X .\nA triangle inequality now gives us\n\u2016xh \u2212 x\u2016X \u2264 \u2016xh \u2212\u03a0Xx\u2016X + \u2016(I \u2212\u03a0X)x\u2016X . \u2016(I \u2212\u03a0X)x\u2016X ,\nand the approximation properties of \u03a0X conclude the proof.\n5. A multipoint rotation-flux MFE method. We continue by considering the lowest order instance of the finite element family of the second kind, i.e. X (2) h from (4.2) with k = 0. In 3D, this space contains two degrees of freedom per edge for the rotation r \u2208 N(2)1 and three degrees of freedom per face for the flux q \u2208 BDM1. By choosing an appropriate quadrature rule for the inner products in Rh and Qh, we can localize the mass matrix around the vertices. In turn, the variables (r, q) can be eliminated through static condensation and we obtain a multipoint mixed finite element method for the Biot system with (u, p) \u2208 RT0 \u00d7 P0 in Subsection 5.1. The stability and convergence of this method are shown in Subsection 5.2.\n5.1. Static condensation. Following [14], we consider a specific quadrature rule for functions \u03d5, \u03c6 on a simplicial mesh:\n\u3008\u03c6, \u03d5\u3009h := \u2211 \u03c9\u2208\u2126h |\u03c9| n+ 1 \u2211 x\u2208V(\u03c9) \u03c6\u03c9(x) \u00b7 \u03d5\u03c9(x)(5.1)\nin which \u03c6\u03c9 is the restriction of \u03c6 on an element \u03c9 \u2208 \u2126h and V(\u03c9) is the set of its vertices. The dot product herein reduces to the standard product for scalar \u03c6, \u03d5.\nWe emphasize that \u3008\u03c6, \u03d5\u3009h is non-zero if and only if the basis functions \u03c6, \u03d5 are non-zero at the same vertex of a mesh element. It has two more advantageous properties, which we highlight in the following lemma.\nLemma 5.1 ([14, Thm. 4.1]). The norm \u2016 \u00b7\u2016h induced by the inner product (5.1) is equivalent to the L2-norm on Rh and Qh:\n\u2016\u03c6\u2016h h \u2016\u03c6\u2016, \u2016\u03d5\u2016h h \u2016\u03d5\u2016, \u2200(\u03c6, \u03d5) \u2208 Rh \u00d7Qh.(5.2)\nMoreover, the quadrature rule is exact if the test function is elementwise constant:\n\u3008rh, r\u030ah\u3009h = \u3008rh, r\u030ah\u3009\u2126, \u2200rh \u2208 Rh, r\u030ah \u2208 R\u030ah := Pkn0 ,(5.3a) \u3008qh, q\u030ah\u3009h = \u3008qh, q\u030ah\u3009\u2126, \u2200qh \u2208 Qh, q\u030ah \u2208 Q\u030ah := Pn0 .(5.3b)\nWe will apply this quadrature rule on the L2-inner products on the two spaces Rh\u00d7Qh. In particular, we substitute \u3008\u00b7, \u00b7\u3009h in the definition of A to obtain the discrete operator Ah : Xh \u2192 X \u2032h:\n\u3008Ahxh, x\u0303h\u3009 := \u00b5\u22121\u3008rh, r\u0303h\u3009h + (2\u00b5+ \u03bb)\u3008\u2207 \u00b7 uh,\u2207 \u00b7 u\u0303h\u3009\u2126 + \u3008K\u22121qh, q\u0303h\u3009h + c0\u3008ph, p\u0303h\u3009\u2126. (5.4)\nIn turn, we define Ah := Ah +B \u2212B\u2217, which leads us to the following problem: find x\u0302h \u2208 Xh such that\n\u3008Ahx\u0302h, x\u0303h\u3009 = \u3008f, x\u0303h\u3009, \u2200x\u0303h \u2208 Xh.(5.5)\nNext, we aim to eliminate the variables r\u0302h and q\u0302h to obtain a multipoint mixed finite element method. For that, let us consider the matrix representation of (5.5). Let Mu and Mp be the mass matrices on the spaces Uh and Ph, respectively. Moreover, let Mr,h and Mq,h be the matrices corresponding to the quadrature rule, applied to the basis functions of Rh and Qh. Let Br, Bu, and Bq be the representations of the curl on Rh, the divergence on Uh, and the divergence on Qh, respectively. Finally, to shorten notation, we let B\u0302r = MuBr, B\u0302u = MpBu, and B\u0302q = MpBq denote the action of these differential operators in their respective range spaces.\nSince Mr,h and Mq,h are easily invertible, the variables r\u0302h and q\u0302h can now be eliminated by taking a Schur complement. We arrive at the algebraic formulation of the multipoint rotation-flux mixed finite element method (MR-MFEM): find (u\u0302, p\u0302) \u2208 Uh \u00d7 Ph such that [ (2\u00b5+ \u03bb)BTuMuBu + \u00b5B\u0302rM \u22121 r,h B\u0302 T r \u2212\u03b1B\u0302Tu\n\u03b1B\u0302u c0Mp + \u03b4 2KB\u0302qM \u22121 q,hB\u0302 T q\n] [ u\u0302 p\u0302 ] = [ fu \u2212 \u00b5B\u0302rM\u22121r,h fr\nfp \u2212 \u03b4KB\u0302qM\u22121q,hfq\n] , (5.6)\nwith u\u0302, p\u0302 the vector representations of u\u0302h and p\u0302h, respectively, and f = [fr, fq, fu, fp] T representing the right-hand side f \u2208 X \u2032h in (4.3). We will refer to (5.5) as the reducible problem and the equivalent (5.6) as the reduced problem. We remark that (5.6) is a discretization of the following system, in which we recognize the (1, 1)-block as the weighted vector Laplacian from (2.3):[\n\u2212\u2207(2\u00b5+ \u03bb)\u2207 \u00b7+\u2207\u00d7 \u00b5\u2207\u00d7 \u2207\u03b1 \u03b1\u2207\u00b7 c0 \u2212\u2207 \u00b7 \u03b42K\u2207 ] [ u\u0302 p\u0302 ] .(5.7)\nRemark 5.1. The more general case in which the conductivity K is an elementwise constant, full tensor can be handled by defining a new lumped mass matrix MKq,h such that qTMKq,hq\u0303 = \u3008K\u22121q, q\u0303\u3009h for all q, q\u0303 \u2208 Qh. However, we restrict our analysis to constant, scalar K and will only consider the more general case in the numerical examples of Section 7.\n5.2. Analysis. We devote this subsection to the theoretical results concerning the MR-MFEM (5.6). After presenting general findings, we present specific results for the two-dimensional case in Subsection 5.2.1.\nLemma 5.2 (Well-posedness). The operator Ah satisfies\n\u2016xh\u2016X h sup x\u0303h\u2208Xh \u3008Ahxh, x\u0303h\u3009 \u2016x\u0303h\u2016X , \u2200xh \u2208 Xh.(5.8)\nIn turn, the reducible problem (5.5) admits a unique and bounded solution x\u0302h \u2208 Xh.\nProof. The same arguments as in Theorem 4.2 are followed, using the equivalence \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016 h \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016h when necessary.\nAs in Lemma 5.1, we let R\u030ah := Pkn0 with kn := ( n2 ) and Q\u030ah := Pn0 be the spaces containing elementwise constant (vector) functions. Additionally, let \u03a0\u030aR and \u03a0\u030aQ be their respective L2 projections. These have the following approximation properties for sufficiently regular (r, q) \u2208 R\u00d7Q:\n\u2016(I \u2212 \u03a0\u030aR)r\u2016 . h\u2016r\u20161, \u2016(I \u2212 \u03a0\u030aQ)q\u2016 . h\u2016q\u20161.(5.9)\nLemma 5.3 (Convergence). The solution x\u0302h to (5.5) converges linearly to x, the solution to (3.3). I.e. a constant C exists, depending on the physical parameters and the regularity of x, such that\n\u2016x\u0302h \u2212 x\u2016X \u2264 Ch.(5.10)\nProof. We follow [14, Thm. 3.2] by first showing that the solutions x\u0302h and xh converge linearly to each other and then using Theorem 4.3 to obtain the result. We start by considering the norm of the difference and use Lemma 5.2 with the fact that Axh = Ahx\u0302h to derive:\n\u2016x\u0302h \u2212 xh\u2016X h sup x\u0303h\u2208Xh \u3008Ah(x\u0302h \u2212 xh), x\u0303h\u3009 \u2016x\u0303h\u2016X = sup x\u0303h\u2208Xh \u3008(A\u2212Ah)xh, x\u0303h\u3009 \u2016x\u0303h\u2016X\n= sup x\u0303h\u2208Xh \u3008(A\u2212Ah)xh, x\u0303h\u3009 \u2016x\u0303h\u2016X\nWe continue by bounding the numerator, which consists of the following terms:\n\u3008(A\u2212Ah)xh, x\u0303h\u3009 = \u00b5\u22121(\u3008rh, r\u0303h\u3009\u2126 \u2212 \u3008rh, r\u0303h\u3009h) +K\u22121(\u3008qh, q\u0303h\u3009\u2126 \u2212 \u3008qh, q\u0303h\u3009h)\nFor the first term, we derive the upper bound\n\u00b5\u22121(\u3008rh, r\u0303h\u3009\u2126 \u2212 \u3008rh, r\u0303h\u3009h) = \u00b5\u22121(\u3008rh \u2212 \u03a0\u030aRr, r\u0303h\u3009\u2126 + \u3008\u03a0\u030aRr \u2212 rh, r\u0303h\u3009h) \u2264 \u00b5\u22121(\u2016rh \u2212 \u03a0\u030aRr\u2016\u2016r\u0303h\u2016+ \u2016\u03a0\u030aRr \u2212 rh\u2016h\u2016r\u0303h\u2016h) h \u00b5\u22121\u2016rh \u2212 \u03a0\u030aRr\u2016\u2016r\u0303h\u2016\nThe second term is bounded analogously and we obtain\n\u3008(A\u2212Ah)xh,x\u0303h\u3009 . \u00b5\u22121\u2016rh \u2212 \u03a0\u030aRr\u2016\u2016r\u0303h\u2016+K\u22121\u2016qh \u2212 \u03a0\u030aQq\u2016\u2016q\u0303h\u2016\n.

We present these invariants formally in the following lemma and subsequent corollaries. The proofs are analogous to [10], but are included here for the sake of completeness.\nLemma 5.4. The application of the quadrature rule does not affect the curl of the rotation, i.e. \u2207\u00d7 r\u0302h = \u2207\u00d7 rh.\nProof. Let ur = \u2207 \u00d7 (r\u0302h \u2212 rh) and consider the test function x\u0303 = (0, ur, 0, 0). Using the fact that \u2207 \u00b7 ur = 0, we derive\n0 = \u3008Ahx\u0302h \u2212Axh, x\u0303\u3009 = \u3008\u2207 \u00d7 (r\u0302h \u2212 rh), ur\u3009\u2126 + (2\u00b5+ \u03bb)\u3008\u2207 \u00b7 (u\u0302h \u2212 uh),\u2207 \u00b7 ur\u3009\u2126 \u2212 \u3008p\u0302h \u2212 ph,\u2207 \u00b7 \u03b1ur\u3009\u2126 = \u2016\u2207 \u00d7 (r\u0302h \u2212 rh)\u20162.\nCorollary 5.5. In the decoupled case of \u03b1 = 0, the volumetric strain is not affected by the quadrature rule. I.e. \u2207 \u00b7 u\u0302h = \u2207 \u00b7 uh.\nProof. Let us consider x\u0303 = (0, u\u0302h \u2212 uh, 0, 0). Using \u2207 \u00d7 (r\u0302h \u2212 rh) = 0 from Lemma 5.4 and \u03b1 = 0, we derive:\n0 = \u3008Ahx\u0302h \u2212Axh, x\u0303\u3009 = (2\u00b5+ \u03bb)\u2016\u2207 \u00b7 (u\u0302h \u2212 uh)\u20162.\n5.2.1. The two-dimensional case. In the special case with n = 2, we obtain stronger results concerning the rotation variable, which we present in the following corollary and lemma, respectively.\nCorollary 5.6. In 2D, the rotation variable is entirely unaffected by the quadrature rule: r\u0302h = rh.\nProof. In 2D, the curl is given by the rotated gradient \u2207\u00d7 u = (\u2212\u22022u, \u22021u). In turn, Lemma 5.4 implies that r\u0302h \u2212 rh is a constant. For x\u0303 := (\u00b5(r\u0302h \u2212 rh), 0, 0, 0), we derive using R \u2286 R\u030ah and Lemma 5.1:\n0 = \u3008Ahx\u0302h \u2212Axh, x\u0303\u3009 = \u3008r\u0302h, r\u0302h \u2212 rh\u3009h \u2212 \u3008rh, r\u0302h \u2212 rh\u3009\u2126 = \u3008r\u0302h, r\u0302h \u2212 rh\u3009\u2126 \u2212 \u3008rh, r\u0302h \u2212 rh\u3009\u2126 = \u2016r\u0302h \u2212 rh\u20162.\nLemma 5.7 (Improved estimate). If n = 2, then we obtain second order convergence in the rotation variable:\n\u2016r\u0302h \u2212 r\u2016 = \u2016rh \u2212 r\u2016 . h2\u2016r\u20162(5.11)\nProof. The equality was shown in Corollary 5.6. For the second, we introduce the projection PR : R \u2192 Rh obtained by solving the following problem: find PRr \u2208 Rh such that\n\u3008\u2207 \u00d7 PRr,\u2207\u00d7 r\u0303h\u3009\u2126 = \u3008\u2207 \u00d7 r,\u2207\u00d7 r\u0303h\u3009\u2126, \u2200r\u0303h \u2208 Rh.(5.12)\nIn case \u2202r\u2126 = \u2205, we set \u3008PR, 1\u3009\u2126 = \u3008r, 1\u3009\u2126 to ensure uniqueness. Since \u2207\u00d7 is a rotated gradient in 2D, PRr is an L1 approximation of the solution to a Laplace problem, which gives us the approximation property\n\u2016(I \u2212 PR)r\u2016 . h2\u2016r\u20162.(5.13)\nLet the test function x\u0303 := (rh \u2212PRr,\u03a0h(uh \u2212 u), 0, 0) with \u03a0h the L2 projection onto Ran(\u2207\u00d7, Rh) \u2286 Qh, as in the proof of Lemma 4.1. We now use \u2207 \u00b7\u03a0h = 0 and the orthogonality property (5.12) to derive\n0 = \u3008A(xh \u2212 x), x\u0303\u3009 = \u00b5\u22121\u3008rh \u2212 r, rh \u2212 PRr\u3009\u2126 \u2212 \u3008uh \u2212 u,\u2207\u00d7 (rh \u2212 PRr)\u3009\u2126 + \u3008\u03a0h(uh \u2212 u),\u2207\u00d7 (rh \u2212 r)\u3009\u2126\n= \u00b5\u22121\u3008rh \u2212 r, rh \u2212 PRr\u3009\u2126 \u2212 \u3008\u03a0h(uh \u2212 u),\u2207\u00d7 (I \u2212 PR)r\u3009\u2126 = \u00b5\u22121\u3008rh \u2212 r, rh \u2212 PRr\u3009\u2126 = \u00b5\u22121(\u2016rh \u2212 r\u20162 + \u3008rh \u2212 r, (I \u2212 PR)r\u3009\u2126)\nCombining this with (5.13), we arrive at the following bound\n\u2016rh \u2212 r\u2016 = \u2212\u3008rh \u2212 r, (I \u2212 PR)r\u3009\u2126\n\u2016rh \u2212 r\u2016 \u2264 \u2016(I \u2212 PR)r\u2016 . h2\u2016r\u20162.\n6. Parameter-robust preconditioning for 4F-MFEM. We follow the preconditioning framework [16], which uses the Riesz representation operator as the canonical preconditioner. In particular, let \u3008\u00b7, \u00b7\u3009X be the inner product on X that induces the norm \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016X from (3.4). Then we define the preconditioner P : X \u2032h \u2192 Xh as the operator that satisfies\n\u3008Pf, x\u0303\u3009X = \u3008f, x\u0303\u3009, \u2200(f, x\u0303) \u2208 X \u2032h \u00d7Xh.(6.1)\nLet L(Xh, Xh) denote the space of linear maps Xh \u2192 Xh and let \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016L(Xh,Xh) be its norm. From Lemma 3.2, we have \u2016PA\u2016L(Xh,Xh) . 1 and, additionally, Lemma 4.1 implies that \u2016(PA)\u22121\u2016\u22121L(Xh,Xh) & 1. In turn, the condition number of the preconditioned system satisfies\n\u03ba(PA) = \u2016PA\u2016L(Xh,Xh)\u2016(PA) \u22121\u2016L(Xh,Xh) . 1.(6.2)\nSince our analysis is based on bounds with constants that are independent of material parameters, this condition number is bounded from above for all admissible parameters. In turn, the operator P is a parameter-robust preconditioner for 4FMFEM.\nDue to the definition of the norm \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016X , the operator P has a block-diagonal structure with the blocks defined according to their inverses:\n\u3008P\u22121r r, r\u0303\u3009 := \u00b5\u22121(\u3008r, r\u0303\u3009\u2126 + \u3008\u2207 \u00d7 r,\u2207\u00d7 r\u0303\u3009\u2126), \u3008P\u22121u u, u\u0303\u3009 := \u00b5\u3008u, u\u0303\u3009\u2126 + (2\u00b5+ \u03bb)\u3008\u2207 \u00b7 u,\u2207 \u00b7 u\u0303\u3009\u2126, \u3008P\u22121q q, q\u0303\u3009 := K\u22121\u3008q, q\u0303\u3009\u2126 + \u03b42\n\u03b7 + c0 \u3008\u2207 \u00b7 q,\u2207 \u00b7 q\u0303\u3009\u2126, \u3008P\u22121p p, p\u0303\u3009 := (\u03b7 + c0)\u3008p, p\u0303\u3009\u2126.\nWe emphasize that this preconditioner requires solving independent systems for the variables r, u, q, and p. In order to generate a preconditioner that is scalable for larger systems, these solves can be replaced by spectrally equivalent operators [16]. However, such extensions are beyond the scope of this work.\n7. Numerical results. In this section, we present numerical experiments to show the performance of the proposed schemes. We first perform convergence studies in Subsection 7.1 to verify the results from Section 4 and Section 5. Subsequently,\nSubsection 7.2 shows the robustness of the preconditioner introduced in Section 6. Finally, Subsection 7.3 presents the approximations for the Mandel problem computed by the proposed four-field and multipoint schemes.\nWe focus on the lowest order instances of the families of finite elements introduced in Section 4. We refer to the first as the two-field mixed finite element method for elasticity (2F-MFEM ), respectively the four-field MFEM for poroelasticity (4FMFEM ). For the second kind, we apply the quadrature rule from Section 5, and we use the acronym MR-MFEM to refer to the resulting multipoint rotation(-flux) mmixed finite element method.\nAll the numerical results are obtained with the libraries PorePy [13] and PyGeoN [1]. The scripts of all the test are publicly available at https://github.com/ compgeo-mox/rotation based biot.\n7.1. Convergence study. In this section we evaluate the performance of the method by considering the numerical errors. In particular, we consider problems (2.4) and (2.8) for n = 2 and n = 3, with the computational domain given by the unit cube \u2126 = (0, 1)n. For simplicity, all material parameters are set to 1 and we assume homogeneous essential conditions on \u2202\u2126.\n7.1.1. Linear elasticity. We consider the following exact solutions for n = 2 and 3 of Problem (2.4), respectively:\nu(x, y) = x2y2(1\u2212 x)2(1\u2212 y)2[4,\u22121]T ,(7.1a) u(x, y, z) = x2y2z2(1\u2212 x)2(1\u2212 y)2(1\u2212 z)2[4,\u22121, 2]T ,(7.1b)\nand we set r = \u2207\u00d7 u. The source term fu is computed accordingly. The relative L2 errors against the analytical solutions are reported in Table 7.1. We notice second order convergence of r for n = 2 for both 2F-MFEM and MR-MFEM as shown in Lemma 5.7. In all the other cases, the unknowns converge linearly with respect to the mesh size, as expected by Theorem 4.3 and Lemma 5.3. Moroever, the number of degrees of freedom is significantly smaller for MR-MFEM compared to the 2F-MFEM, and the errors are observed to be larger for the former than for the latter.\nIn Table 7.2, we compare the solutions of the two methods by computing the relative norms of their differences and associated convergence rates. We observe that the curl of the rotation \u2207 \u00d7 r and the divergence of the displacement \u2207 \u00b7 u are unaffected by the quadrature rule (5.1), as was shown in Lemma 5.4 and Corollary 5.5, respectively. Moreover, the computated rotation is identical for the two methods if n = 2, in agreement with Corollary 5.6.\n7.1.2. Poroelasticity. Next, we consider Problem (2.8). Let the exact solutions for the displacement be given by (7.1), while for the flow variables, we consider:\nq(x, y) = [sin(2x\u03c0) sin(2y\u03c0), xy(1\u2212 x)(1\u2212 y)]T , p(x, y) = xy(1\u2212 x)(1\u2212 y),\nq(x, y, z) = sin(2x\u03c0) sin(2y\u03c0) sin(2z\u03c0)xyz(1\u2212 x)(1\u2212 y)(1\u2212 z) y(1\u2212 y) sin(2x\u03c0) sin(2z\u03c0)  , p(x, y, z) = xyz(1\u2212 x)(1\u2212 y)(1\u2212 z). Moreover, we set r = \u2207\u00d7u, and the source terms in the second and fourth equations of (2.8a) are computed accordingly. For simplicity we have considered also a vector source term in the third equation of (2.8a), which does not affect the previously introduced theory.\nIn Table 7.3 we present the relative L2 errors against the analytical solutions of the unknowns for both methods in 2D and 3D. We notice that in all cases the errors decay at least with order one, which is expected by Theorem 4.3 and Lemma 5.3. The rotation in 2D is again second order convergent as observed in the previous example and supported by Lemma 5.7. We notice that in 3D, the errors for the MR-MFEM are higher than 4F-MFEM, also higher than in the previous example, probably due to the fact that we are now performing hybridization on two variables. The inital higher order of convergence are due to the high errors obtained on the coarse grids we start with.\nTable 7.4 contains the relative L2 errors for the differentials, i.e. the relevant curl and divergence, of the numerical solutions against their analytical counterparts. Also in this case we obtain at least order one for all variables, in agreement with the theory.\nFinally, in Table 7.5 and Table 7.6 we compare the solutions of the two numerical methods by computing the relative norms of their difference. As in the elasticity example, we notice that in 2D the curl of r is unaffected by the quadrature rule (5.1)\nin accordance with Lemma 5.4. For the other variables we get at least first order convergence, because both solutions converge linearly to the true solution.\n7.2. Parameter-robust preconditioning. In this part, we present the performance of the parameter-robust preconditioner for 4F-MFEM presented in Section 6 on the test case from Subsection 7.1. For this, we first symmetrize the system by negating the second and third rows of A in (2.8). We then consider the MINRES iterative algorithm with stopping criteria based on relative residual tolerance, which is\nset to 10\u22125. In Figure 7.1 we present the number of iterations obtained for n = 2 and 3 for a wide range of the material parameters. We see that the number of iterations is stable for most of the parameter values. We notice a slight dependency in a few cases, but the number of iterations remains moderate.\nFinally, we have applied the same strategy for the elasticity problem (2.4), which can be seen as the limit case of \u03b1 = 0. By varying its parameters and mesh size, we obtain a stable number of iterations between 2 and 5 (not reported in a figure), confirming the robustness of the preconditioner.\n7.3. Mandel\u2019s problem. In this section we consider Mandel\u2019s test case [3], which admits an exact solution in 2D and exhibits interesting time-dependent effects. Let us consider a two-dimensional, poroelastic domain between two rigid plates on the upper and bottom boundaries of the domains, that are free to slide. A force of 2F is applied on the plates causing a uniform displacement \u03bd \u00b7 u that is independent of x. The domain is displayed in the left of Figure 7.2. Due to the symmetries of the problem, we consider a quarter of the domain. Classically, the following boundary conditions are applied:\n\u03bd \u00b7 u = 0, \u03bd \u00d7 (\u03c3\u03bd) = 0, \u03bd \u00b7 q = 0, on \u03931 \u222a \u03932, \u03c3\u03bd = 0, p = 0, on \u03933,\n\u03bd \u00b7 u = const, 1 a \u222b \u03934 \u03bd \u00b7 (\u03c3\u03bd) = \u22122F, \u03bd \u00d7 (\u03c3\u03bd) = 0, \u03bd \u00b7 q = 0 on \u03934.\nWe adapt these conditions to our formulation of the problem by setting \u2202u\u2126 = \u2202\u2126, \u2202p\u2126 = \u03933, and \u2202q\u2126 = \u2202\u2126\\\u03933. First, on \u03931 and \u03932, we set \u03bd \u00b7u = 0 and, together with\nn = 2\n\u03bd \u00d7 (\u03c3\u03bd) = 0, we obtain r = 0, which is set as an essential condition. On the other hand, on \u03933 and \u03934, we set \u03bd \u00b7u to be equal to the analytical solution and r = 0. The exact solution for pressure, displacement and stress can be expressed as a series as in [18].\nThe values of the geometric and material parameters are reported in the table in the right of Figure 7.2.

The \u25e6 and \u00d7 markers are the solutions computed by 4F-MFEM and MR-MFEM, respectively.\n4F-MFEM and MF-MFEM, with the analytical solutions. Excellent matching is observed for both schemes. Moreover, we obtain zero rotation, numerically, everywhere in the domain, which corresponds exactly to the zero rotation in the true solution.\n8. Concluding remarks. We have proposed mixed finite element methods for rotation-based poroelasticity in which the rotation variable is approximated in H(\u2207\u00d7,\u2126). Through a hybridization technique, the rotation and flux variables can be locally eliminated, leading to a numerical scheme that uses RT0 \u00d7 P0 for the solid displacement and fluid pressure. A priori analysis shows that the proposed methods are stable and convergent. By using weighted norms, we moreover derive robust preconditioners.\nWe remark on the limitations of our approach. First, we note that the formulation (2.3) of the elasticity equations as a weighted vector Laplacian is based on a spatially constant Lame\u0301 parameter \u00b5. However, the techniques from [6] may be applicable for the more general case of varying \u00b5. Second, the natural boundary conditions for this formulation do not immediately accommodate the typical no-stress boundary condition. In our implementation of Mandel\u2019s problem, we therefore augmented the boundary conditions. Third, we note that nearly incompressible materials are not naturally handled by this formulation since large values of \u03bb lead to undesirable scaling in the matrix. To capture the incompressible limit of \u03bb \u2192 \u221e, it may be desirable to introduce a solid pressure variable similar to [15]. We aim to overcome\nthese limitations in future work. Finally, the numerical results presented show optimal convergence rates and, when the preconditioner is applied, a stable number of iterations for a wide range of data values, all in accordance with the developed theory.\nAcknowledgments.
