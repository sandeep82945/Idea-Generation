 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Further characterize the role of PI4KIIIÎ± and its protein complex in intestinal epithelial polarity and lumen formation. The paper suggests this complex may be important but more work is needed to elucidate the mechanisms. Future studies could look at intestinal organoid or animal models. 

2. Examine how different phosphoinositide species coordinate with Rab GTPases and vesicle trafficking pathways during epithelial polarization. The paper proposes vesicle trafficking is important for establishing membrane domains but details are lacking.

3. Investigate differences in phosphoinositide involvement between various epithelial tissues. The paper notes differences seen between kidney and intestinal models. More comparative work could clarify tissue-specific roles. 

4. Study how glycosphingolipids influence apical domain formation and protein localization. The paper suggests glycosphingolipids are enriched apically but their role in polarity is unclear. Lipid raft studies may reveal mechanisms.  

5. Determine how phosphatidylserine localization relates to phosphoinositide distribution during polarization. The interplay between these lipids seems important but is not well characterized. Imaging and lipid manipulation studies could provide insight.
