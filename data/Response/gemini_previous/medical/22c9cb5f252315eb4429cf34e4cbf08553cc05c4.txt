1. **Investigate the genetic basis of early-life activity traits and their relationship with reproductive performance.** This could be done through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) or other genetic analyses. Understanding the genetic basis of these traits would help to determine their heritability and potential for selection.


2. **Explore the relationship between early-life activity traits and other aspects of sow productivity and longevity.** For example, researchers could examine the relationship between early-life activity traits and sow longevity, sow health, or sow feed efficiency. This would help to determine the overall impact of early-life activity traits on sow productivity and profitability.


3. **Develop and validate a selection index that incorporates early-life activity traits for use in breeding programs.** This would allow producers to select for gilts that are more likely to have favorable reproductive performance and longevity. The selection index could be based on the results of the regression analyses conducted in this study, as well as other relevant research.


4. **Investigate the relationship between early-life activity traits and sow behavior in the farrowing crate.** This could be done through video recordings or other methods of behavior monitoring. Understanding the relationship between early-life activity traits and sow behavior in the farrowing crate could help to identify sows that are at risk for savaging or other aggressive behaviors.


5. **Conduct longitudinal studies to track the activity traits of gilts over time and examine their relationship with reproductive performance and longevity.** This would help to determine the stability of early-life activity traits and their impact on sow productivity over multiple farrowing cycles.
