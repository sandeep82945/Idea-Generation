 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct a study with biopsy-confirmed LN diagnosis to validate the findings in this claims data study. This would provide more definitive evidence of the increased burden in patients with biopsy-proven LN versus SLE without renal involvement.

2. Examine indirect costs, patient-reported outcomes, and quality of life in patients with LN versus SLE without LN to get a more comprehensive picture of disease burden. The current study only looked at direct healthcare costs. 

3. Investigate the effects of different LN treatment regimens on outcomes like flare rates, kidney function decline, and costs. This could identify optimal treatment strategies to manage LN.

4. Develop and validate a claims-based algorithm to identify renal flares in LN using criteria similar to clinical trials. Applying consistent flare criteria would improve research using claims data.

5. Conduct a prospective, longitudinal study following newly diagnosed patients to characterize long-term outcomes, healthcare utilization, and costs in LN. The current study was retrospective and cross-sectional. A long-term study could provide valuable natural history data.
