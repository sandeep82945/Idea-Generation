    "abstractText": "Distilled jujube liquor is an alcoholic beverage made from jujube, which has a unique flavor and a sweet taste. The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of mixed fermentation on the quality of distilled jujube liquor by comparing the performance of mixed fermentation between S. cerevisiae, Pichia pastoris and Lactobacillus. The results showed that there were significant differences in the quality of the jujube liquor between the combined strains. Moreover, Lactobacillus increased and P. pastoris reduced the total acid content. The results from an E-nose showed that the contents of methyl, alcohol, aldehyde, and ketone substances in the test bottle decreased significantly after decanting, while the contents of inorganic sulfide and organic sulfide increased. Fifty flavor compounds were detected, including nineteen esters, twelve alcohols, seven ketones, six aldehydes, three alkenes, one furan, one pyridine, and one acid. There were no significant differences in the type or content of flavor compounds. However, PLS-DA showed differences among the samples. Eighteen volatile organic compounds with variable importance in projection values > 1 were obtained. There were sensory differences among the four samples. Compared with the sample fermented with only S. cerevisiae, the samples co-fermented with Lactobacillus or with P. pastoris had an obvious bitter taste and mellow taste, respectively. The sample fermented by all three strains had a prominent fruity flavor. Except for the sample fermented with only S. cerevisiae, the jujube flavor was weakened to varying degrees in all samples. Co-fermentation could be a valuable method to improve the flavor quality of distilled jujube liquor. This study revealed the effects of different mixed fermentation modes on the sensory flavor of distilled jujube liquor and provided a theoretical basis for the establishment of special mixed fermentation agents for distilled jujube liquor in the future.",

            "text": "Jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill) is a plant from the family Rhamnaceae that originated in China [1]. Jujube has been cultivated for more than 4000 years and is grown in Xinjiang, Shandong, Hebei, Gansu, and Ningxia [2,3]. Jujube fruit contains a variety of vitamins, especially vitamin C and polysaccharides [4,5], and is considered a traditional medicinal with nutritional value [6,7]. The fruit usually matures in the autumn and winter. Fresh jujube can be stored for 3\u20134 days at room temperature, but the storage period can be extended to several weeks by refrigeration [8]. In addition to refrigeration, drying increases the storage period and enhances the flavor characteristics of the fruit [9,10]. A deep-processing method is required to convert dried jujube into alcoholic beverages. Jujube wine with unique flavors can be produced after fermentation. In recent years,\nFoods 2023, 12, 795. https://doi.org/10.3390/foods12040795 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/foods\nFoods 2023, 12, 795 2 of 14\nresearchers have conducted studies on the production technology and quality of jujube wine. For example, Lee et al compared jujube wine brewed from different raw materials and found that drying had a great impact on the quality and flavor of jujube wine [8]. Xia et al. used GC-O-MS to determine the main aroma compounds and odor activity values of jujube brandy. Through the calculation of odor activity values, the authors identified 27 aroma and 16 flavor compounds [11]. Zhao et al., who fermented jujube wine using Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Bacillus licheniformis, concluded that mixed fermentation effectively improved quality [12]. Xu et al. reported that pulse electric fields significantly enriched the floral and fruity volatile notes of jujube wine [13]. In addition, Cai et al. used HS-SPME-GC-MS to assess the effects of pretreatment and leaching on jujube wine quality. Their findings showed that blended-into-pulp and leached-pectinase treatments significantly improved the quality of jujube wine [14]. The production technology of jujube wine is similar to that of traditional port wine, i.e., it requires raw material pretreatment, leaching, fermentation, and aging [8,14,15]. The production technology results in a jujube wine with a strong jujube flavor but a low ethanol content. In general, a solid-state fermentation technology combined with distillation is used to produce distilled jujube liquor. However, the high levels of pectin in jujube [16] result in an excessive methanol content. Therefore, liquid fermentation coupled with distillation are used to improve the liquid ratio during fermentation. Additionally, pectinase and cellulase are used to reduce pectin in raw materials, thereby reducing their methanol content. Compared with non-distilled jujube wine and distilled jujube liquor produced by solid-state fermentation technology, there is less research on liquid fermentation technology and the special fermentation agents of jujube liquor. Brandy and Chinese Baijiu are traditional distilled liquors [17,18] that contain water, alcohols, esters, acids, aldehydes, ketones, and aromatic compounds [19,20]. These alcoholic beverages have unique flavor characteristics. Brandy has a strong fruit aroma, while Baijiu has a richer taste and mixed aroma. In this study, to obtain both the fruity flavor of brandy and the rich taste of Baijiu, probiotics [21,22] from Baijiu fermentation were used in the production of a new type of distilled jujube liquor. Sensory evaluation combined with gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (GC-IMS) were used to evaluate the effects of mixed fermentation with S. cerevisiae (SC), S. cerevisiae and Lactobacillus (SC.L), S. cerevisiae, and Pichia pastoris (SC.PP), S. cerevisiae, P. pastoris, and Lactobacillus (SC.PP. L) on the quality of distilled jujube liquor."

There were differences in ethanol, residual sugar, total acid, chromaticity, and transmittance.\nNote: Different letters in the same column represent statistically significant differences (p < 0.05).\nThe ethanol content of the jujube liquor fermentation broth in SC, SC.L, SC.PP, and SC.L.PP was 11.4%, 10.6%, 9.4%, and 11.2%, respectively. The ethanol content of SC.PP.L was slightly lower than SC, but the difference was not significant, indicating that Lactobacillus and P. pastoris had a certain impact on the ethanol production capacity of S. cerevisiae. The residual sugar content in SC and SC.PP.L was 0.26 and 0.24 g/L, respectively, with no significant differences. The highest content of residual sugar was in SC.PP (0.30 g/L), which had a negative correlation with the ethanol content. In other words, the content of residual sugar with a high ethanol content was relatively low because the sugar was converted into ethanol as a substrate. Wang et al. found that the residual sugar content in the mixed fermentation state was significantly higher than that in the pure S. cerevisiae fermentation, and the ethanol content in the pure S. cerevisiae fermentation was the highest, which was similar to the results of this study, indicating that the mixed fermentation of S. cerevisiae and non-S. cerevisiae would lead to the reduction of ethanol production [26]. The highest total acid content was in SC.L (5.48 g/L), followed by SC (5.05 g/L), SC.L.PP (4.88 g/L), and SC.PP (3.93 g/L). Lactobacillus converts sugars into lactic acid, so the total acid content in SC.L was the highest. S. cerevisiae produces acids during metabolism, while P. pastoris inhibits acid production [21,27]. Therefore, total acid was lowest in SC.PP. SC and SC.PP had the lowest and highest chromaticity, respectively. In contrast, transmittance was the highest and lowest in SC and SC.PP, respectively. Therefore, the color and light transmittance of jujube liquor fermentation liquor were affected by the different strains. At the same time, the chromaticity and transmittance of the sample seem to have some relationship with the residual sugar content. When the residual sugar content is low, the light transmittance is higher and the chromaticity is lower.\nFoods 2023, 12, 795 5 of 14\nThe author speculates that P. pastoris has poor ethanol production capacity, and it will compete with S. cerevisiae for carbon source, thus significantly reducing the ethanol concentration. In addition, some studies have shown that acid can reduce the activity of S. cerevisiae and even kill it [28], while the interaction between P. pastoris and S. cerevisiae can reduce the acid content, thus increasing the ethanol yield."

Compared with 0 min, the strength of sensors 6 and 8 for jujube\nFoods 2023, 12, 795 6 of 14\nwine placed for 5 min decreased, and the strength of sensors 7 and 9 increased significantly. It is speculated that the reason may be that methyl, alcohol and aldehyde, and ketone substances are more volatile, and the loss is greater during the placing process. However, inorganic sulfide and organic sulfide volatilize relatively slowly, so they are detected in large quantities after being placed. Similar to port wine, the sulfide in jujube liquor is mainly brought into the fermentation system when adding sulfur-containing fungicides. These compounds have a significant impact on port wine aroma attributes and quality [29]. When the sulfide concentration (such as H2S) exceeds the safe range, it will impart the aromas of rotten egg and sewage [30]. Similarly, these substances have a negative impact on the quality of jujube liquor, and the content of sulfide can be reduced by decanting."

In addition, the jujube\nFoods 2023, 12, 795 12 of 14\nflavor of the samples, with the exception of SC, was weakened to varying degrees. Above all, the results show that different microbial combinations have an impact on the quality of distilled jujube liquor. These combination strategies can be applied to improve the sensory characteristics of distilled jujube liquor, but the types and mixing proportion of microorganisms need to be further optimized until a special starter suitable for distilled jujube liquor can be established.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/foods12040795/s1, Table S1: The flavor compounds presented in the jujube liquor by GC\u2013IMS.\nAuthor Contributions: B.Z.: methodology, investigation, data curation, writing\u2014original draft, software, formal analysis; C.Z. and Z.S.: conceptualization, funding acquisition; L.L.: review, funding and editing; C.W.: software, funding.
