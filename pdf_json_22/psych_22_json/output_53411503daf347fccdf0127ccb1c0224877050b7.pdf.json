(1) Highest educational qualification (university or higher degree,\nprofessional qualification, \u2018A\u2019 level or equivalent, \u2018O\u2019 level or equivalent, below \u2018O\u2019 level or\nequivalent, and no formal qualification); (2) socioeconomic status at mid-life (based on the\nRegistrar General\u2019s classification of occupations (OPCS, 1980), ranging from social class I\n(professional) to social classes V (unskilled) and VI (out of labour force); (3) time in current job\n(in years); (4) number of times unemployed since age 30 (never, once, and twice or more); (5)\ncurrently unemployed; (6) not changed jobs since age 30 for better pay or promotion; (7) current\nhousing tenure (owner occupied vs all other tenures); (8) whether in a pension scheme.\nRelationships and social participation. Mid-life self-reported relationship and social participation\nhistories were reported as (1) never married or cohabited for at least one month; (2) number of\nmarital/partnership breakdowns (none, one, two, three, four or more) and (3) living alone at\nfollow-up (i.e., not living with partner, husband/wife, children, parents, or others). Participants\nwere also asked whether they had friends/family members they could rely on to (4) listen to their\nproblems and/or (5) provide help if needed (scale from 0 - \u201cnot at all\u201d to 4 - \u201ca lot\u201d). (6) We\ncreated an index of social participation (scored 0 to 10) from reports of any current participation\n(occasionally, monthly, weekly, or more often) in a range of organizations or voluntary activities\n(sports/social clubs; political parties; trade union; evening classes; charity/voluntary\norganizations; women\u2019s/men\u2019s groups; parents/school organization; tenants/residents association;\nother local activities; and church/religious groups). As a social exclusion indicator, participants\nwere also asked (7) if they voted in the last General Election (3 years prior to the mid-life follow-\nup).\nHealth. Study members at mid-life reported on (1) their current general health (good/excellent vs\nfair/poor); (2) any long-standing illness or disability; (3) ever registered disabled; (4) past week\nhazardous alcohol consumption defined as \u2265 21 units for males and \u2265 14 for females (Department\nof Health, 1995). (5) alcohol problems: scores of \u2265 2 on the 4-item CAGE alcohol problems screen\n(Mayfield, McLeod, & Hall, 1974); (6) current smoker; (7) psychological distress, using a sum\nscore of the 15 \u2018psychological\u2019 items from the Malaise Inventory (Rutter, Tizard, & Whitmore,\n1970), a widely used measure with good psychometric properties (Rodgers, Pickles, Power,\nCollishaw, & Maughan, 1999).\nPersonality. (1) Neuroticism, (2) extroversion) and (3) psychoticism personality traits were\nassessed using the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (Eysenck & Eysenck, 1991). These traits\nwere assessed by asking yes/no questions such as \u201cWould you call yourself a nervous person?\u201d\n(neuroticism) and \u201cCan you easily get some life into a rather dull party?\u201d (extroversion) and\nreverse-coded items such as \u201cDoes it worry you if you know there are mistakes in your work?\u201d\n(psychoticism). Questions were scored 0 or 1 and there were 12 items for each trait. Internal\nconsistency measured with Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 was acceptable for neuroticism (\u03b1=.92), extroversion\n(\u03b1=.94) and psychoticism (\u03b1=.75).\nSocial exclusion. We created an index of social exclusion from counts of: unemployed at follow-\nup; not owner-occupier; no occupational/private pension; living alone at follow-up; no support\nfrom family or friends; no participation in social groups; did not vote in last General Election;\nand registered disabled. We contrasted study members reporting 3 or more of these difficulties\nwith those reporting 0-2.\nAppendix S2. Model-based reliability indices\nWe used six indices to evaluate the bifactor model (Rodriguez, Reise, & Haviland, 2016):\n1) Reliability index omega (\u03c9), a model-based reliability estimate, analogous to the alpha\ncoefficient, but appropriate for tests that have varying factor loadings; 2) hierarchical omega\n(\u03c9H), the proportion of total variance attributed to the general or specific factors (\u03c9 and \u03c9H\ncoefficients vary between 0 and 1, where higher scores indicate greater reliability); 3) factor\ndeterminacy (FD): the correlation between the factor scores and the estimated factor (factor score\nreliability), which indicates that factor scores should be used if FD is at least .9; 4) H: a measure\nof construct replicability that quantifies how well each latent factor is represented by the items\nloading on it (H > .7 represents a well-defined latent variable) (Hancock, G. R & Mueller, R. O.,\n2001); 5) Explained common variance (ECV): the proportion of the total variance explained by\nthe general factor; 6) Percent uncontaminated correlations (PUC): the percent of all correlations\namong symptoms attributable the general factor. When \u03c9H is > .8 and ECV and PUC are >.7, the\nconstruct can be interpreted as unidimensional.\nAppendix S3. Measurement invariance\nWe also tested measurement invariance using multigroup CFA for models of parent and\nteacher reports. We tested if parent and teacher models are structurally similar (configural\ninvariance), if items are equally correlated with the latent factors (metric invariance, tested by\nconstraining the factor loadings to be equal across informants) and if items capture symptom\nseverity at an equivalent level (scalar invariance, tested by additionality constraining item\nthreshold to be equal across informants). \u0394CFI < .01 and \u0394RMSEA < .015 between nested models\nwith increasing levels of constraints indicate that mean level differences between teachers and\nparents are due to differences in the latent trait (i.e., psychopathology) and not due to other sources\nof variation and they are, therefore, invariant (Chen, 2007; Svetina, Rutkowski, & Rutkowski,\n2020). Of note, for the hyperactivity factor, we only used two items for equivalence testing\n(restless and fidgety).\nMeasurement invariance results are presented in Table S3. None of the increasing levels\nof model constraint (configural, metric and scalar) modified model fit beyond threshold levels of\n\u0394RMSEA < .015 and \u0394CFI < .01, revealing that differences found between parent and teacher\nreport are not due to differences in the structure, correlation among items and the latent factors or\ndifferences in the ability of each item to capture symptomatic severity across informants and,\ntherefore, that mean levels of parent and teacher ratings on the Rutter scale can be compared.\nAppendix S4. Descriptive table of baseline variables and outcomes\nTable S1 describes all predictors collected at ages 9 to 10 and 14 to 15 years, and Table\nS2 describes the mid-life outcomes, defined above, and shows the inverse probability weights for\nresponse at follow-up and parent response.\nAppendix S5. Correlation among baseline covariates and main predictors\nCorrelations among sum scores of the Rutter questionnaire items for parents (A) and\nteachers (B), as well as total sum scores, along with factor scores derived from questionnaires A\nand B can be seen in Table S4. Correlations among baseline social class, gender, IQ and all factors\nderived from the bifactor models are depicted in Table S5.\nReferences\nChen, F. F. (2007).
