Neurogenesis-dependent neuroplasticity seems to be\u00a0 critical to continuously adapt to internal and environmental changes. Stress is a potent environmental factor that can produce potent and enduring effects on brain structure and function. Acute and chronic stress is known to cause alterations in neurogenesis and microglia in classical adult neurogenic regions such as the hippocampus. The hypothalamus is one of the major brain regions implicated in homeostatic stress and emotional stress systems, but little is known about the effect of stress on the hypothalamus. Here, we\u00a0studied the impact of acute and intense stress (water immersion and restrain stress, WIRS), which may be\u00a0 considered as an inducer of an animal model of posttraumatic stress disorder, on neurogenesis and neuroinflammation in the hypothalamus of adult male mice, focusing on three nuclei: PVN, VMN and ARC, and also in the periventricular area. Our data revealed that a unique stressor was sufficient to provoke a significant impact on hypothalamic neurogenesis by inducing a reduction in the proliferation and number of immature neurons identified as DCX+ cells. These differences were accompanied by marked microglial activation in the VMN and ARC, together with a concomitant increase in IL-6 levels, indicating that WIRS induced an inflammatory response. To investigate the possible molecular mechanisms responsible for neuroplastic and inflammatory changes, we\u00a0 tried to identify proteomic changes. The data revealed that WIRS induced changes in the hypothalamic proteome, modifying the abundance of three and four proteins after 1 h or 24 h of stress application, respectively. These changes were also accompanied by slight changes in the weight and food intake of the animals. These results are the first to show that even a short-term environmental stimulus such as acute and intense stress can have neuroplastic, inflammatory, functional and metabolic consequences on the adult hypothalamus.\nKEYWORDS\nneurogenesis, microglia, inflammation, acute stress, hypothalamus, hypothalamic proteomic profile\nOPEN ACCESS\nEDITED BY Jos\u00e9 Luis Trejo, Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), Spain\nREVIEWED BY Pablo Galeano, IIBBA-CONICET Leloir Institute Foundation, Argentina Muriel Darnaudery, Universit\u00e9 de Bordeaux, France\n*CORRESPONDENCE Carmen Pedraza mdpedraza@uma.es Margarita P\u00e9rez-Mart\u00edn marper@uma.es\n\u2020These authors share first authorship\nRECEIVED 20 March 2023 ACCEPTED 23 May 2023 PUBLISHED 23 June 2023\nCITATION Infantes-L\u00f3pez MI, Nieto-Quero A, Chaves-Pe\u00f1a P, Zambrana-Infantes E, Cifuentes M, M\u00e1rquez J, Pedraza C and P\u00e9rez-Mart\u00edn M (2023) New insights into hypothalamic neurogenesis disruption after acute and intense stress: implications for microglia and inflammation.

            "text": "Stress can have an impact on the structure and function of the brain and can result in changes in mood and motivation, among other behaviors (Pizzagalli, 2014). The hypothalamus is considered the center of the limbic system (RajMohan and Mohandas, 2007). Situated at the convergence of many neural pathways, the hypothalamus serves as a regulator of several critical homeostatic processes and mediates emotional responses mainly through the autonomic nervous system (McCorry, 2007). There, many hormonal and autonomic responses take place, which seem to be\u00a0key for controlling the stress response system (Ulrich-Lai and Herman, 2009; Godoy et\u00a0al., 2018). In fact, hypothalamic outputs regulate functions that are significantly impaired by stress, such as metabolic, endocrine, behavioral, and sexual functions (Jurkowski et\u00a0al., 2020). However, the neurobiological changes that take place in the hypothalamus as a consequence of stress are not known in detail.\nIn recent decades, the hypothalamus has emerged as a new neurogenic area, containing new neurons generated after early development (Zhan et\u00a0al., 2013; Jurkowski et\u00a0al., 2020). The presence of neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs) in this area suggests the existence of a neurogenic niche with the ability to replicate and populate local neural circuits (Xu et\u00a0al., 2005; P\u00e9rez-Mart\u00edn et\u00a0al., 2010; Lee et\u00a0 al., 2012). Although the level of neurogenesis is low compared to those detected under basal physiological conditions in other conventional neurogenic regions, such as the hippocampus, there is a growing interest in clarifying the process of hypothalamic neurogenesis because of the functional implications of this region. Neurogenesis-dependent neuroplasticity is crucial for the hypothalamus to continuously adapt to internal and environmental changes (Pierce and Xu, 2010; Ming and Song, 2011).\nThe effects of stress on hippocampal neurogenesis are widely known, and it has been described that stress strongly suppresses adult hippocampal neurogenesis (Schoenfeld and Gould, 2012; Lu et\u00a0al., 2014; Llorens-Mart\u00edn et\u00a0al., 2016; Ito et\u00a0al., 2017; Lee and Giuliani, 2019), as these cellular disturbances are linked to the neuropathology of stress-related disorders (Campbell and Macqueen, 2004; Lucassen et\u00a0al., 2010; Snyder et\u00a0al., 2011). Similar to the hippocampus, various factors have emerged as potent modulators of hypothalamic neurogenesis. In fact, hormones such as gonadal hormones (Yoo and Blackshaw, 2018), behavioral and environmental stimuli such as social isolation (Lieberwirth et\u00a0al., 2012), changes in diet, mainly fat-based diet (McNay et\u00a0al., 2012), early life stress (Kisliouk et\u00a0al., 2014), heat stress (Bielefeld et\u00a0al., 2021), can affect hypothalamic neurogenesis. It is therefore not unreasonable to think that stress may have an impact on hypothalamic neurogenesis. Therefore, as a structure involved in the control of the organism\u2019s homeostasis, its study is of great interest.\nOn the other hand, in the hippocampus, although not entirely conclusive, it appears that changes in neuroinflammation mediated primarily via microglial cells may play an essential role in regulating neurogenesis (Ekdahl et\u00a0al., 2003; Monje et\u00a0al., 2003; Nieto-Quero et\u00a0al., 2021). However, it is not known whether microglial changes also mediate the effects of stress on hypothalamic neurogenesis. Although there are numerous studies aimed at understanding the neuroinflammatory response in brain regions involved in emotional regulation (hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, etc.), the information available on changes at the level of the hypothalamus is scarce, and it is unknown whether, as in the hippocampus, there is a possible\nrelationship between microglial response to stress and hypothalamic neurogenesis.\nSince the study of acute stress-induced effects can provide valuable information on the mechanisms involved in the stress response and pathological responses to stress, we\u00a0set out to study the neurogenic changes and neuroinflammatory response in the hypothalamus as a consequence of exposure to acute and intense stress, which can act as a model of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), an anxiety disorder associated with biological disturbances, with the hypothalamus being a particularly affected structure (Mironova et\u00a0al., 2017). We\u00a0have also addressed whether changes in hypothalamic microglia mediate neurogenic changes. For this purpose, we\u00a0have used an animal model of acute water immersion and restraint stress (WIRS), whose application has been associated with microglial morphological changes (Sugama et\u00a0al., 2007), neuroinflammatory conditions and hippocampal neurogenic alterations (Mao et\u00a0al., 2020), and numerous neuroendocrine and neurotransmitter system impairments that have been associated with numerous psychopathological disorders (Ohta et\u00a0al., 2017; Yasugaki et\u00a0al., 2019) such as anxiety-like, depression-like and memory impairment phenotypes (Purwoningsih et\u00a0al., 2022). In these animals, we\u00a0have measured neurogenic changes, analysing cell proliferation and immature neurons, inflammatory changes, hypothalamic microglial response and the relationship between both processes in three hypothalamic nuclei key in emotional regulation and stress response. Specifically, we\u00a0investigated the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) which is directly involved in regulating the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis (HPA) (Herman et\u00a0al., 2016), the ventromedial nucleus (VMN), because of its relation to food intake and metabolism (Eghbal-Ahmadi et\u00a0al., 1997; Tasker and Jo\u00ebls, 2015), the arcuate nucleus (ARC), which is crucial for the maintenance of energy homeostasis (Yi et\u00a0al., 2006), and the periventricular region (PE) which is consider a proliferative area of the adult hypothalamus (Lee and Ahima, 2012). To better characterize the response to stress, we\u00a0studied proteomic changes 1 h and 24 h after stress. Weight and food intake were recorded after exposure to stress to explore metabolic consequences."

The following biotinylated secondary antibodies were used at a 1:1,000 dilution: goat anti-rabbit IgG (Dako, CA, USA, cat. # E0432), rabbit anti-rat IgG (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, United\u00a0States, cat. # 31834), and donkey anti-goat IgG (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, United\u00a0States, cat. # PA1-28663, donkey).\nFirst, slices were washed in PBS three times for 10 min with agitation at room temperature. For the BrdU protocols, an additional step of antigen retrieval was necessary. It consisted of a 15 min incubation in 2 N HCl at 37\u00b0C followed by three quick PBS washes and three additional 10 min washes. Then, endogenous peroxidase was inactivated (10% H2O2, 10% methanol in PBS) by agitation for 45 min away from light at room temperature. After three 10 min washes in PBS, tissue saturation was followed by a 1 h incubation in PST (2.5% sheep serum, 0.75% Triton-X100\u00a0in PBS). Tissue was later incubated in primary antibody solution in PST o/n at 4\u00b0C with agitation.

Later, slices underwent three quick washes and three 10 min washes. For DCX, DAB was supplemented with 0.4% NiCl2 to intensify staining. Slices were mounted on a gelatine-coated slide following the rostrocaudal axis. For Iba-1 slides, a contrast staining was performed by staining for 5 s in 0.3% toluidine blue. Slides were dehydrated and mounted using Eukitt mounting media. For the negative control, the primary antibody was omitted.\nThe immunofluorescence protocol was similar to the previous protocol. The differences are as follows. No endogenous peroxidase inactivation step was needed, and therefore the tissue was directly blocked after antigen retrieval and subsequent washes. The same primary antibody and dilution for BrdU and DCX were used. In this case, they were incubated together in the same solution o/n at 4\u00b0C.

However, in the ARC, where the number of BrdU+ cells was higher, a significant decrease was observed after stress treatment [t(1,6) = 3.239, p = 0.017, N = 8]. The periventricular region of the hypothalamus (PE) was of interest to find that the majority of BrdU+ cells were arranged just below the ependymal layer and located along the entire wall of the third ventricle (Figure\u00a06C).

In control animals, the morphology of DCX+ cells in the hypothalamus differed from its hippocampal counterparts, as the cells were rounder and the ramifications were less apparent (Figures\u00a06H\u2013J vs. Figure\u00a06B). In addition to the aforementioned regions, the periventricular region (PE) was found to be\u00a0 of interest, as most of the young neurons identified as DCX+ were found there (Figure\u00a06D). In addition, it was in the PE where new neurons, identified as BrdU+/DCX+, with a round shape and no processes, were found in control animals (Figures\u00a06K\u2013N).\nIn any case, the number of hypothalamic immature neurons in the VMN, ARC, and PE was twice as abundant as that in the PVN, with approximately 20 and 10 cells per tissue section, respectively (Figure\u00a06P). After stress treatment, DCX+ cells were considerably reduced in all the regions studied (Figure\u00a06P). More specifically, DCX+ cells were practically abolished in the PVN and reduced to approximately five or fewer cells per section in the VMN, ARC, and PE (Figure\u00a06P)."

In the PVN, no significant changes were found for any of the studied parameters [t(1,10), p > 0.05, N = 12] (Figure\u00a08). However, the VMN showed significant alterations due to stress in all studied parameters except for the regularity index [t(1,10), p < 0.05, N = 12] (Figure\u00a08). Altogether, this showed an increase in cell density in the region and a shift toward an increase in soma size and a more ameboid phenotype, similar to Figure\u00a07M. This change was evidenced by the increase in cells considered to have a high reactivity phenotype (Figure\u00a08K). Moreover, the rise in the fraction of the area occupied by the threshold aligned with these results (Figure\u00a08T). For the ARC, the cells displayed a denser distribution after stress [t(1,10), p < 0.05, N = 12], and only two of the morphological parameters were altered, namely, solidity [t(1,10) = 2.986, p = 0.014, N = 12] and circularity [t(1,10) = 2.295, p = 0.044, N = 12] (Figures\u00a0 8F\u2013G).

            "text": "The hypothalamus is a core structure in regulating the neuroendocrine system and controls key physiological processes such as homeostasis and metabolism (Maggi et\u00a0al., 2015; Romanov et\u00a0al., 2020; Bielefeld et\u00a0al., 2021). In recent years, it has emerged as a new neurogenic area, generating new neurons after development (P\u00e9rezMart\u00edn et\u00a0al., 2010; Lee and Ahima, 2012; Langlet et\u00a0al., 2013). It is a widely established fact that the hypothalamus responds to environmental stimuli, and a reduction in hypothalamic neurogenesis has been increasingly linked to alterations in hypothalamic functions. However, to our knowledge, the neurogenic response of the hypothalamus to psychological stressors during adulthood has not been studied. The study of acute stress-induced neurological effects during the first phases following exposure to a stressor can provide valuable information to know better the response to stress. For this reason, we\u00a0have studied the impact of acute and intense stress on hypothalamic neurogenesis and neuroinflammation using an animal model that mimics some of the neurobiological and psychopathological alterations of PTSD (Nieto-Quero et\u00a0al., unpublished data), an anxiety disorder that has been associated with neurobiological alterations, with the hypothalamus being particularly affected (Mironova et\u00a0al., 2017). Our data reveal for the first time that even a short-term environmental stimulus such as intense and acute stress (WIRS) could have a significant impact on the hypothalamus by inducing a reduction in proliferation and immature neuronal cells in the parenchymal areas surrounding the 3rd ventricle of the hypothalamus. These changes were accompanied by an increase in microglia reactive to acute stress and a concomitant increase in inflammation, as revealed by the increased in IL-6 levels and the proteomics analysis. These changes were also accompanied by slight changes in the weight and intake of the animals.\nOur data revealed that acute stress reduced proliferation in the PE and ARC. Moreover, acute stress reduced the number of DCX+ cells in the parenchyma of all studied areas, indicating a negative effect on hypothalamic neurogenesis. The hypothalamus is a core structure in\nthe regulation of the neuroendocrine system and controls key physiological processes such as homeostasis and metabolism (Maggi et\u00a0al., 2015; Romanov et\u00a0al., 2020; Bielefeld et\u00a0al., 2021). Consequently, stimuli that alter neurogenesis may have functional effects on hypothalamic functioning. Importantly, it has been shown that environmental manipulation that reduced hypothalamic neurogenesis induced changes in leptin signaling, body adiposity, and diet responsivity (Maniam et\u00a0al., 2016; Yam et\u00a0al., 2017). Direct inhibition of adult PE neurogenesis results in impaired hypothalamic functions, resulting in problems in weight regulation, energy metabolism and body adiposity and alterations in the response to a high-fat diet (Lee and Ahima, 2012; McNay et\u00a0al., 2012; Yoo et\u00a0al., 2020). Inhibition of cell proliferation in the ventral regions of the hypothalamus caused weight loss and food intake deficits in mice. These effects revealed that hypothalamic newborn/immature neurons may play a critical role in the regulation of energy balance and be\u00a0 specifically required for weight management (McNay et\u00a0 al., 2012). Therefore, when hypothalamic plasticity is reduced, hypothalamic network adaptability may become compromised, resulting in simultaneous defective energy balance. It is therefore not surprising that acute stress can lead to homeostatic changes. Indeed, acute stress had a slight effect on intake and body weight, indicating that it had an impact on metabolism. Thus, despite very low levels of hypothalamic neurogenesis under basal conditions, small changes in this process may have potentially outsized effects on physiology and behavior. However, more long-term studies are needed to understand the extent of these effects and the long-term impact of intense acute stress on hypothalamic plasticity.\nHowever, how stress impacts hypothalamic neurogenesis remains unknown. Recent studies, which focus on other neurogenic regions, indicate that changes in inflammation, mediated primarily via microglial cells, may play an essential role in this process (Sierra et\u00a0al., 2010). Microglia are myeloid cells that may rapidly respond to even minor changes in the microenvironment. Among their numerous functions, microglia play a role in regulating adult neurogenesis (Ekdahl et\u00a0al., 2003; Kempermann and Neumann, 2003; Sierra et\u00a0al., 2010; Valero et\u00a0 al., 2016; Diaz-Aparicio et\u00a0 al., 2020). In both the hypothalamus and other neurogenic regions, in response to stress, microglia undergo several morphological changes (Sugama et\u00a0 al., 2007; Walker et\u00a0al., 2013), which, with exceptions, have been linked to functional changes. Here, we\u00a0 characterized the microglial cell population in the PVN, VMN and ARC. Under basal conditions, the degree of microglial activation is very similar among the three nuclei studied, although, as expected, the number and morphology of microglia in the ARC nucleus indicate a slightly higher degree of activation. The ARC is a circumventricular organ strategically placed to detect even small signals circulating in the blood and report on peripheral metabolic status (Djogo et\u00a0al., 2016; Garc\u00eda-C\u00e1ceres et\u00a0al., 2019). After acute stress, PVN microglia were surprisingly unresponsive to the stressor, despite their role in regulating the release of trophic hormones in response to several inputs from both the CNS and peripheral system (Sawchenko and Swanson, 1982; Biag et\u00a0al., 2012; Bouyer and Simerly, 2013; Rosin and Kurrasch, 2019). In contrast, microglia in the VMN and in the ARC responded to the acute stress protocol. As such, stress induced an increase in microglial density and a reduction in the distances between microglia in both hypothalamic nuclei. In parallel, a change in microglial morphology compatible with an amoeboid appearance was observed, which together with the changes in total microglial staining suggests an\nFrontiers in Neuroscience 14 frontiersin.org\nincrease in WIRS-reactive microglia. This assumption was corroborated by clustering analyses, which indicated an increased proportion of stress-reactive microglia. However, the use of markers of activated microglia by immunohistochemistry could be\u00a0a good complement to the morphological studies, allowing better characterization of the microglia in response to stress.\nMoreover, cytokine determination revealed a significant increase in the level of IL-6 1 h after stress. In this sense, although IL-6 may act as both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory molecule, acute stress is an \u201cinjury-like stimuli,\u201d under which IL-6 can act as a pro-inflammatory cytokine (Bobbo et\u00a0al., 2019). Marked microglial activation together with a concomitant increase in IL-6 levels indicate that WIRS induced an inflammatory response in the VMN and the ARC. Microglia may act as injury-responsive mediators of hypothalamic dysfunction. Environmental factors modulate microglia, which can regulate brain function, namely, neurogenesis, which participates in different stages and is necessary for proper adjustment of the process (Gemma and Bachstetter, 2013; Valero et\u00a0al., 2016; de Miranda et\u00a0al., 2017; Frank et\u00a0al., 2019; Rosin and Kurrasch, 2019; Diaz-Aparicio et\u00a0 al., 2020). Although there are some differences, we\u00a0have shown that in both the VMN and ARC, higher microglial density and larger area are associated with a lower number of immature neurons and lower body weight on a regular basis. In addition, there were statistically significant differences between controls and stressed animals in Factor 1, indicating that stressed animals had a higher number of WIRS-reactive microglia, a decreased number of DCX+ cells and a lower body weight.\nTABLE\u00a01 Cluster names, nodes, interactors and scores for topology-based densely connected regions in the enriched network provided by STRING and analysed by MCODE in Cytoscape.\nSample Cluster name\nN. of nodes in cluster\nN. of interactors\nCluster score\nGenes in cluster\nOverexpressed 1 h\npost-stress\nCluster 1 10 27 6,000 Mia3, Cdhr4, Brox, Arhgap15, Mon1a, Traip, Apeh, Ip6k1,\nHps6, Actl11\nCluster 2 21 58 5,800 Dlg2, Nrxn3, Dlg4, Anks1b, Gpx6, Pacsin1, Shank3, Snrpc,\nAnk3, Mpp2, Taf11, Gfap, Tcp11, Gad1, Cpne6, Agap2,\nScube3, Zfp523, Cntn4, D17Wsu92e, Rbfox3\nCluster 3 4 5 3,333 Mnat1, Arhgap33, Trip4, Tmtc4\nCluster 4 3 3 3,000 Camkv, Mst1r, Rnf123\nCluster 5 3 3 3,000 Syn2, Calm1, Calm3\nOverexpressed 24 h\npost-stress\nCluster 1 35 581 34,176 Snap47, Napa, Syt1, Sec22b, Vamp7, Stx6, Stx11, Stx18,\nStxbp5, Stx7, Vps33a, Snap29, Vamp1, Stxbp1, Stx1a,\nVti1b, Stx3, Stx1b, Vamp3, Cplx2, Vamp2, Snap23, Stx12,\nStx5a, Snap25, Stx19, Vamp8, Stx4a, Cplx1, Nsf, Stx16,\nStx2\nCluster 2 20 146 15,368 Syn1, Slc18a2, Rab3a, Rims1, Syt4, Ppfia1, Syn3\nCask, Unc13b, Lin7b, Gad1, Apba1, Gad2, Ppfia3, Lin7a,\nLin7c, Slc17a7, Bzrap1, Ppfia2, Ppfia4\nCluster 3 14 51 7,846 Slc32a1, Snap91, Exoc7, Sv2a, Bsn, Grin2b, Syt2\nUnc13a, Syp, Dlg4, Exoc3, Syt5, Slc18a3, Dnm1\nCluster 4 6 13 5,200 Scn2a1, Scn1a, Cdkl5, Pcdh19, Pnpo\nCluster 5 4 6 4,000 Sptan1, Ins1, Ins2, Uso1\nRepressed 24 h post-\nstress\nCluster 1 31 465 31,000 Rps26-ps1, Fau, Rps2, Rps13, Rps27a, Rps3a1, Rps11, Rps3,\nRps9, Rps6, Hba-a1, Rps5, Rps26, Rps15, Rps17, Rps8,\nRps14, Rps12-ps3, Rps20, Rps24, Rps28, Rps29, Rps10,\nRps16, Rps25, Rpsa, Rps23, Rps21\nCluster 2 19 171 19,000 Pnliprp1, Lipg, Acsl5, Pnlip, Acsl4, Acsl1, Mgll, Acsbg1, Lipf,\nPnpla2, Cel, Pnliprp2, ENSMUSG00000024209, Pnpla3,\nAcsbg2, Lpl, Lipc, Acsl3\nCluster 3 14 91 14,000 Hbb-bs, Apol9b, Apol7c, Apol7a, Apol9a, Apol11b, Apol7e,\nApol10b, Hp, Apol10a, Apol8, Apol11a\nCluster 4 11 50 10,000 Cnr2, Dse, Abhd12, Dagla, Trpv1, Naaa, Napepld, Abhd6,\nFaah\nCluster 5 4 5 3,333 Hba-a2, Alas2, Hbb-bt, Hbb-y\nCluster 6 3 3 3,000 Mogat1, Agk, Mogat2\nCluster 7 3 3 3,000 Lrp1, Cd163, Hpx\nNodes refer to protein/gene names.\nFrontiers in Neuroscience 15 frontiersin.org\nOn the other hand, we\u00a0 tried to determine whether proteomic changes take place at 1 h and 24 h after the application of WIRS. The data revealed that WIRS induced changes in the hypothalamic proteome, modifying the abundance of three and four proteins after 1 h or 24 h of stress application, respectively.\nThe modified protein data revealed that 1 h after stress, the levels of proteins were increased, including Cpne6, Camkv and AIDA-1 (Anks1b). These proteins have been directly or indirectly linked to calcium regulation, neuroplasticity and transcriptional activity (Liang et\u00a0al., 2016; Barylko et\u00a0al., 2022). More specifically, Cpne6 is a calcium sensor implicated in long-term potentiation and dendritic spine morphology in the hippocampus, and its deficiency has been linked to memory deficits and plasticity (Reinhard et\u00a0al., 2016; Burk et\u00a0al., 2018). Camkv has been found in mRNA form in vesicles near dendritic spines and is activated under neuronal activation to further activate gene expression via the Rho transcription factor in the hippocampus. Its deficiency has been linked to memory deficits and synaptic impairment (Liang et\u00a0al., 2016). AIDA-1, has been associated with the postsynaptic density scaffold, which is key for new synapse formation or already existent reinforcement. It also regulates NMDA receptor subunit composition, promoting a greater GluN2A presence and transport of GluN2B to the endoplasmic reticulum in the hippocampus (Younis et\u00a0al., 2019). GluN2B subunit transport to the ER could be\u00a0related to upregulation in ER transport found in the enrichment analysis 24 h after stress. This composition has been found to be\u00a0more prevalent in mature neurons than in young neurons (Sun et\u00a0al., 2018), which could indicate maturation in the neurogenic process of stressed animals. Among the impairments that have been associated with high levels of these proteins is the development of inflammation by an increase in IL-6 (Ahola-Olli et\u00a0al., 2017) and an impairment in body weight control (Younis et\u00a0 al., 2019). The normalization of Cpne6 and Camkv levels and downregulation of AIDA-1 expression observed 24 h after stress coincided temporally with the return to baseline values in IL-6 and corroborated this effect. These individual findings in the literature seem to be\u00a0supported by the enrichment analysis, which noted the activation of synaptic density-related proteins as well as calcium-dependent protein binding. This process is highly relevant for synapse homeostasis, as well as for synaptic generation and plasticity (Ho et\u00a0al., 2000; Borger et\u00a0al., 2014).\nOn the other hand, among the proteins under- or overexpressed 24 h after the application of the stressor, the Hba protein, a subunit of hemoglobin, is noteworthy. Expression of this protein in various brain regions (Genecards, HBA1) has been linked to the regulation of oxidative stress and has been identified in various neurodegenerative diseases (Zheng et\u00a0al., 2022). The functional network indicated that haem group capture from plasma as well as oxygen transportation and haem group binding were downregulated in stressed mice. This could be\u00a0indicative of poor oxygen conditions in the hypothalamus similar to ischaemia, which triggers necrotic cell death and a subsequent inflammatory response, including reactive oxygen species and inflammatory cytokine production (Kawabori and Yenari, 2015). This hostile environment could lead to poor neurogenic development and support lower immature neuron findings. Moreover, 24 h after stressor application, a reduction in Mgll, a lipase that has been associated with inactivation of endocannabinoids, has been observed (Dinh et\u00a0al.,\n2002). Endocannabinoids have been associated with the control of intake, appetite, and energy balance in the hypothalamus. Enrichment analysis further supported this finding, pointing toward a reduction in lipid-transporting proteins and lipid degradation, as well as in the endocannabinoid system. Lipid metabolism in the brain is tightly connected to brain injury and inflammation (Adibhatla and Hatcher, 2008), and alterations in lipid availability and transportation (for example, via APOE proteins) have been found to increase inflammatory disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s (Zhong et\u00a0al., 2019; Duro et\u00a0al., 2022). This could explain, at least in part, the reduction in weight and intake observed in stressed animals. Moreover, an upregulation of neurotransmitter release and the active zone in excitatory synapses was found 24 h after stress, which together with the upregulation in synaptic density and calcium-dependent protein binding found 1 h after stress, could indicate prolonged activation in excitatory synapses. Although excitation is related to long-term potentiation processes (Pradier et\u00a0al., 2018), in this study, we\u00a0found evidence supporting NMDA but not AMPA regulation, suggesting other possible mechanisms. One of them could be\u00a0excitotoxicity, where an excess in neurotransmitter activity can lead to cell death and hypoxia (Choi, 2020), which we\u00a0found in our results. Moreover, excitotoxicity has been linked to the CB1 endocannabinoid receptor and neurogenic progenitor proliferation (Aguado et\u00a0 al., 2007), which adds to the evidence found in this study. However, given the short time elapsed between the application of the stressor and the measurements taken, further studies are needed to determine the effect of an acute and intense stressor on metabolism. In this regard, the changes observed in microglia, together with the increase in inflammatory cytokines and proteomic changes could indicate an increase in the inflammatory response following WIRS application for 2 h.\nIn conclusion, our data revealed that following an acute stressor, particularly an intense stressor that may be\u00a0considered to establish an animal model of PTSD, many changes that provide valuable insights into the mechanisms involved in the impact of the stress response on the physiologically relevant hypothalamus were initiated (Campbell et\u00a0al., 2017). Thus, our results show that stress exposure restricted to 2 h induced structural (morphological changes in microglia), functional (protein changes and plasticity), and metabolic consequences (reduction of intake and body weight). These acute stress-related changes may contribute to explaining how limited exposure to acute stress results in the metabolic and autonomic impairment associated with stress-related disorders. Furthermore, we\u00a0have shown, at least in the VMN and ARC, that the microglial response is related to stress-induced neurogenic changes and metabolic impairment. Taken together, these data reveal that even a short-term stressor can have a significant impact on the hypothalamus, a central regulator of the neuroendocrine system that controls key physiological processes and may shed light on the neurobiological mechanisms involved in the development of PTSD.\nData availability statement\nThe data presented in this study are deposited and made publicly available in: Dataset Orbitrap Raw-Data Stress Hypothalamus(1h-24h): https://dx.doi.org/10.24310/riuma.26229.\nFrontiers in Neuroscience 16 frontiersin.org\nEthics statement\nThe animal study was reviewed and approved by University of Malaga Ethical Committe (CEUMA 51-2018-A) and corroborated by the Agriculture, Farming, Fishing and Sustainable Development Council (10/06/2019/114).\nAuthor contributions\nMII-L, AN-Q, and EZ-I: procedures with animals.
