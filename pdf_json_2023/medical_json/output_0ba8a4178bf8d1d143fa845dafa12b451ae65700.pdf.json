    "abstractText": "Introduction: Symptomatic dry eye disease is a multifactorial ocular surface condition caused by disruption of the precorneal tear film and is a common clinical finding in diabetic patients. However, there was no study on the prevalence and associated factors of symptomatic dry eye disease among diabetic patients in Ethiopia or in the study area. Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and associated factors of symptomatic dry eye disease among adult diabetic patients in Adare General Hospital, Hawassa City, Southern Ethiopia, in 2023. Methods: A hospital-based cross-sectional study design was conducted on 493 adult diabetic patients who were selected using systematic random sampling, from April 23 to June 8, 2023. Data were collected through a face-to-face interview using an ocular surface disease index questionnaire. Binary logistic regression was performed to identify factors potentially associated with symptomatic dry eye disease. Variable with a P value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: A total of 488 subjects participated in this study with a response rate of 99%. The prevalence of symptomatic dry eye disease was 34.8% (95% CI = 30.6\u201339.1). College and university educational status (AOR = 5.88, 95% CI = 2.25\u201315.38), government employed (AOR = 2.22, 95% CI = 1.05\u20134.68), use of visual display unit >5 hours (AOR = 4.41, 95% CI = 1.51\u201312.87), duration of diabetes \u226511 years (AOR = 3.57, 95% CI = 1.28\u20139.90), poor glycemic control (AOR = 2.13, 95% CI = 1.21\u20133.75), allergic conjunctivitis (AOR = 1.99, 95% CI = 1.12\u20133.54), and debris in the tear film (AOR = 3.63, 95% CI = 1.53\u20138.61) were positively associated with symptomatic dry eye disease. Conclusion: The study revealed a high prevalence of symptomatic dry eye disease. Higher educational status, government employed, use of visual display unit, longer duration of diabetes, poor glycemic control, allergic conjunctivitis, and tear film debris were significantly associated with symptomatic dry eye disease. Breaks in screen use, good glycemic control, and treatment of ocular morbidities such as allergic conjunctivitis and debris in the tear film were recommended for all diabetic patients.",

However, there was no study on the prevalence and associated factors of symptomatic dry eye disease among diabetic patients in Ethiopia or in the study area. Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and associated factors of symptomatic dry eye disease among adult diabetic patients in Adare General Hospital, Hawassa City, Southern Ethiopia, in 2023. Methods: A hospital-based cross-sectional study design was conducted on 493 adult diabetic patients who were selected using systematic random sampling, from April 23 to June 8, 2023. Data were collected through a face-to-face interview using an ocular surface disease index questionnaire. Binary logistic regression was performed to identify factors potentially associated with symptomatic dry eye disease. Variable with a P value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: A total of 488 subjects participated in this study with a response rate of 99%. The prevalence of symptomatic dry eye disease was 34.8% (95% CI = 30.6\u201339.1). College and university educational status (AOR = 5.88, 95% CI = 2.25\u201315.38), government employed (AOR = 2.22, 95% CI = 1.05\u20134.68), use of visual display unit >5 hours (AOR = 4.41, 95% CI = 1.51\u201312.87), duration of diabetes \u226511 years (AOR = 3.57, 95% CI = 1.28\u20139.90), poor glycemic control (AOR = 2.13, 95% CI = 1.21\u20133.75), allergic conjunctivitis (AOR = 1.99, 95% CI = 1.12\u20133.54), and debris in the tear film (AOR = 3.63, 95% CI = 1.53\u20138.61) were positively associated with symptomatic dry eye disease. Conclusion: The study revealed a high prevalence of symptomatic dry eye disease. Higher educational status, government employed, use of visual display unit, longer duration of diabetes, poor glycemic control, allergic conjunctivitis, and tear film debris were significantly associated with symptomatic dry eye disease. Breaks in screen use, good glycemic control, and treatment of ocular morbidities such as allergic conjunctivitis and debris in the tear film were recommended for all diabetic patients.

Since the Adare General Hospital in Hawassa City is one of the largest diabetic centers in Southern Ethiopia with an integrated eye care service, providing up-to-date information is important for formulating health policies and allocating adequate resources to address this problem in the study area as well in the country (Ethiopia). Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and associated factors of symptomatic dry eye disease among adult diabetic patients in Adare General Hospital, Hawassa City, Southern Ethiopia in 2023."

            "text": "Study Design, Setting, and Period A hospital-based cross-sectional study design was conducted at Adare General Hospital from April 23 to June 8, 2023. Adare General Hospital is located in Hawassa City, the capital of Sidama Regional State, which is found 275 km away from Addis Ababa. According to the hospital\u2019s planning and information office, Adare General Hospital provides both preventive and curative health care treatments, including eye care, to nearly three million people. With 1 ophthalmologist, 5 optometrists, and 1 ophthalmic nurse, the Department of Ophthalmology at Adare General Hospital provides comprehensive eye care to the surrounding community. Adare General Hospital is also providing care for at least 600 diabetic patients per month over five working days. Clinical care for diabetic patients has been provided by internists, general practitioners, and nurses.\nStudy Population and Eligible Criteria All adult patients aged \u226518 years with type I or type II diabetes who were receiving diabetologic care at Adare General Hospital during the survey period. However, adult diabetic patients who were unable to answer the questionnaire because of speech or mental health problem, patients who were admitted to the inpatient unit seriously ill, patients with media opacities such as corneal and vitreous opacities, and patients with a shallow anterior chamber angle, uveitis, and keratitis were excluded.\nSample Size Determination Sample Size Determination for Objective One The sample size was determined using a single population proportion formula that n \u00bc \u00f0Z\u03b1=2\u00de\n2p\u00f01 P\u00de d2 is with the following\nassumptions (n = Sample size, Z = the value of z statistic at 95% confidence level = 1.96, P = the expected proportion of\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/OPTH.S433679 DovePress Clinical Ophthalmology 2023:17 3430\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nsymptomatic dry eye disease was 49.8%, which was taken from a similar study in Kenya,30 and d \u2013 maximum allowable error (5%). The calculated sample size was 384.\nSample Size Determination for Objective Two Female sex was the consistent factor for symptomatic dry eye disease31 used to calculate the sample size for the second objective using the software EPI INFO version 7, considering a confidence level of 95%, power of 80%, a ratio of unexposed to exposed patients of 1.4, an odds ratio of 1.80, and the proportion of case in exposed and unexposed groups were 72.5% and 59.3%, respectively. So that the computer-generated sample size was 448. The sample size determined for the second objective was chosen because it was large and sufficient to meet both objectives. Adding a non-response rate of 10%, the final required sample size was 493.\nSampling Technique and Procedures Study participants were selected using a systematic random sampling procedure with an interval of 2. To select the first study participant, a single number was drawn by a lottery method, and then continued with every Kth interval. An interval was calculated by dividing the expected number of diabetic patients who visited the diabetes clinic during the data collection period by the calculated sample size (K = N/n, N = 1024, n = 493).\nOperational Definitions Symptomatic dry eye: was defined as those participants who had a score of 13 and above points based on the OSDI questionnaire.32,33\nBlood glucose control: was classified as good if the recorded current fasting blood glucose (FBS) level was less than 152 mg/dl and poor if the current FBS level was 152 mg/dl and above.34\nSmokers: participants who had smoked at least 100 cigarettes during their lifetime and currently smoked either every day or every other day per week.35\nBody Mass Index (BMI) (kg/m2): was classified based on the World Health Organization categorization and calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in square meters (m2). A BMI of <18.5 was considered underweight, a BMI of 18.5\u201324.9 kg/m2 was considered normal, a BMI of 25\u201329.9 kg/m2 was considered overweight, and a BMI of \u226530 kg/m2 was considered obese.36\nVisual impairment: was defined as a present visual acuity of less than 6/12 in the better eye based on 11th the International Classification of Diseases definition of visual impairment.37\nDuration of diabetes: was categorized as 1\u20135, 6\u201310, and \u226511 years.21 Diabetic retinopathy: was diagnosed and classified based on the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study.38\nMeibomian gland dysfunction: was diagnosed based on the presence of at least one of the following clinical findings: excessive and abnormal secretion of the meibomian glands, telangiectasia at the posterior lid margin, frothy discharge at the lid margin or in the inner Canthi area, and pouting or obstruction of the meibomian gland orifices.39\nAllergic conjunctivitis: was diagnosed based on the following clinical findings: Itching, lacrimation, mucoid discharge, conjunctival hyperemia or papillary reaction, variable chemosis, and eyelid edema.39\nAge: was categorized as 18\u201340, 40\u201349, 50\u201359, and \u226560 years.31\nData Collection Tools and Procedure Data were collected by personal interview, review of medical records, and an eye examination. The personal interview, review of medical records, and measurement of height and weight of study participants were performed by two trained nurses, whereas the eye examination was performed by two experienced optometrists.\nThe nurses conducted a face-to-face interview using a pretested and structured questionnaire that included information on socio-demographic characteristics such as age, sex, marital status, residence, educational and occupational status, and monthly income; behavioral data such as cigarette smoking, use of visual display devices, sleep duration, and sunlight exposure, ocular history such as use of artificial tears, intravitreal injections, history of cataract surgery, history of eye examination, history of medication use in the form of eye drops and use of eyeglasses, systemic comorbidities\nClinical Ophthalmology 2023:17 https://doi.org/10.2147/OPTH.S433679 DovePress 3431\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nsuch as asthma, sinusitis, antidepressant medications, and the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire. The OSDI questionnaire contained 12 questions assessing dry eye disease symptoms. The response to each question was scored from 0 to 4, in which 0 represents none of the time, 1 some of the time, 2 half of the time, 3 most of the time, 4 all of the time.32,33 The reliability of the items was checked by calculating Cronbach\u2019s alpha value (0.94). Clinical data such as type of diabetes, fasting blood glucose level, duration of DM, type of treatment, and systemic comorbidities such as hypertension, heart disease, dyslipidemia, diabetic neuropathy, vitamin A deficiency, dermatitis, arthritis, thyroid disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and use of diuretics were recorded in the medical records of the study participants. Weight was measured with a balance-beam scale and height with a wall-mounted stadiometer, and participants appeared in their underwear and without shoes. After completion of the interview, all study participants underwent a comprehensive eye examination. The presenting visual acuity of the study participants was measured in each eye using a Snellen chart at a distance of 6 meters under good room lighting. A slit-lamp biomicroscope with a 90-diopter Volk lens was used to examine the anterior and posterior portions of the eyes with the pupil dilated with 1% tropicamide eye drops to obtain clinical data such as meibomian gland dysfunction, allergic conjunctivitis, debris in the tear film, diabetic retinopathy, panretinal photocoagulation, and vitrectomy.\nData Quality Control At Hawassa University Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, 5% of the sample size was used to pretest a structured questionnaire in Amharic, which was used to control for data quality. Two nurses and optometrists who collected the data were trained in it and their work was supervised, which helped to maintain the quality of the data. In addition, the collected data were checked for completeness at the end of the day to ensure data quality.\nData Processing and Analysis After checking the completeness and consistency of the data, data were entered into the Epidemiological Information (EPI INFO) 7 program and then exported to the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25 for analysis. Multicollinearity was checked using the variance inflation factor and tolerance for controlling the effects of confounding variables on final results. Proportions and summary statistics such as mean, median and standard deviation were calculated for the descriptive data. Bivariable binary logistic regression followed by a multivariable binary logistic regression was performed to identify possible factors associated with symptomatic dry eye disease. The strength of the association between dependent and independent variables was expressed by an adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). The model fitness was ensured by the Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness of fit. A variable with a P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nEthical Consideration This study adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Ethical approval was obtained from the Ethical Review Committee of University of Gondar, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, School of Medicine. Besides, a formal permission letter was also obtained from the medical director of Adare General Hospital. After a full explanation of the purpose of the study, written informed consent was obtained from all study participants. All study participants were informed of their right to withdraw from the study at any time during the interview and eye examination. Confidentiality was ensured by avoiding any personal identifiers from the data collection tool. Finally, patients with sight-threatening diabetic eye complications were referred to an eye clinic for further examination and follow-up."

The odds of developing symptomatic dry eye disease were 3.57 times (AOR = 3.57, 95% CI = 1.28\u20139.90) higher in participants with diabetes duration since diagnosis \u226511 years than in participants with diabetes duration \u22645 years.\nParticipants with poor glycemic control were 2.13 times (AOR = 2.13,95% CI = 1.21\u20133.75) more likely to have symptomatic dry eye disease than participants with good glycemic control. Participants with allergic conjunctivitis were 1.99 times (AOR = 1.99,95% CI = 1.12\u20133.54) more prone to symptomatic dry eye disease than participants without allergic conjunctivitis. Individuals with debris in the tear film were 3.63 times (AOR = 3.63, 95% CI = 1.53\u20138.61) more likely to have symptomatic dry eye disease than those without debris in the tear film (Table 5)."

For example, in the studies conducted in Iran, Hoskote, Bangalore, Ghana, and Kenya, tear break-up time, Schirmer test, and ocular surface disease index questionnaire were used to diagnose dry eye, whereas in this study, only OSDI questionnaire was used to diagnose dry eye.\nParticipants with an educational status of secondary school, college, and university were 2.69 and 5.88 times more likely to have symptomatic dry eye disease, respectively, than those with an educational status of primary school or lower. This result was confirmed by a study conducted in France.46 This could be because as education levels increase, so does the likelihood of coming into contact with visual display devices such as computers, smartphones, and tablets. So, spending more time with screens while blinking less leads to dry eye disease.47\nParticipants who worked 3\u20135 and >5 hours at a VDU had a 3.03- and 4.41-fold higher risk of symptomatic dry eye disease, respectively, than participants who worked \u22642 hours per day at a VDU. Studies conducted on Japanese at VDU users,47 Turkey lecturer,48 and Chinese medical students49 reached similar conclusions. The possible reason for this association could be that individuals working at a VDU for a long period of time are exposed to a low blink rate and evaporation of the precorneal tear film contributes to the development of SDED.47\nParticipants with allergic conjunctivitis were 1.99 times more prone to symptomatic dry eye disease than participants without allergic conjunctivitis. A study conducted in Ethiopia among postgraduate students11 reached a similar conclusion. Allergic conjunctivitis is an inflammatory disorder of the conjunctiva that decreases goblet cell density, alters the lipid layer of the pre-corneal tear film, and increases meibomian gland duct distortion. Those conditions can increase the probability of developing dry eye disease.50,51 Besides, individuals who have used medications such as antihistamines for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis were more likely to develop dry eye disease than their counterparts.52\nThe odds of symptomatic dry eye disease for those participants with a duration of diabetes since diagnosis of 6\u201310 years and \u226511 years were 2.33 and 3.57 times higher than those participants with a duration of diabetes \u22645 years, respectively. This result was in line with the studies conducted in China,5,6 Albania,17 Iran,23 India,18\u201321,40 Pakistan,22 and Egypt.15 The impact of diabetes on the ocular surface is directly proportional to the duration of DM; that means as the duration of diabetes increases, diabetes could damage the accessory lacrimal gland, which leads to a reduction of basic tear secretion and instability of tear film, which facilitate the occurrence of dry eye disease in diabetic patients.53\nParticipants who had poor glycemic control were 2.13 times more likely to have symptomatic dry eye disease than participants with good glycemic control. This finding was consistent with the studies conducted in China,16 Albania,17 India,18\u201321 and Egypt.15 Uncontrolled high blood glucose damages the microvasculature of the lacrimal gland, causes autonomic neuropathy that affects the tear gland, and also disrupts the normal chemical composition and quality of the tear film by increasing the concentration of glucose in the tear film.17,53\nIndividuals with debris in the tear film were 3.63 times more likely to have symptomatic dry eye disease than those without debris in the tear film, which was similar finding in a study conducted in Egypt.15 The possible explanation for this association is that debris can cause blurring of vision and a foreign body sensation in the eye since the debris is the collection or accumulation of the lipid and mucin of the tear film that is found on the cornea and moves with each blink.\nParticipants who were government employed were 2.22 times more likely to have symptomatic dry eye disease than those who were employed in the private business. This is due to the fact that employed individuals spent more time on visual display units with a reduced blinking rate."

The result of this study might be underestimated because the data were collected using only the OSDI questionnaire instead of using a combination of OSDI tools with other objective tests such as the tear break-up time, Schirmer test, and tear osmolarity test. Current fasting blood sugar was used to assess glycemic control because of the lack of facilities to assess glycated hemoglobin in the study area.

            "text": "The study revealed a high prevalence of symptomatic dry eye disease. Higher educational status, government employed, use of visual display unit, longer duration of diabetes, poor glycemic control, allergic conjunctivitis, and tear film debris were significantly associated with symptomatic dry eye disease. Breaks in screen use, good glycemic control, and treatment of ocular morbidities such as allergic conjunctivitis and debris in the tear film were recommended for all diabetic patients. Moreover, further longitudinal studies using objective tests of dry eye are needed to identify the exact predictors of symptomatic dry eye among diabetic patients."
