1. **Investigate the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of isoflavones as Mps1 inhibitors.** This could be done by synthesizing and testing a series of isoflavone derivatives with different substituents and functional groups. This information could be used to design more potent and selective Mps1 inhibitors.


2. **Study the molecular mechanisms by which isoflavones inhibit Mps1 kinase activity.** This could be done using a variety of biochemical and biophysical techniques, such as enzyme kinetics, protein-protein interaction assays, and molecular modeling. This information could help to identify the key interactions between isoflavones and Mps1 that are responsible for inhibition.


3. **Evaluate the efficacy of isoflavones in inhibiting Mps1 activity in cancer cells.** This could be done using a variety of cell-based assays, such as cell proliferation assays, clonogenic assays, and apoptosis assays. This information could help to determine the potential of isoflavones as anti-cancer agents.


4. **Investigate the pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of isoflavones.** This could be done in animal models to determine the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of isoflavones, as well as their potential for toxicity. This information is essential for the development of isoflavones as clinical candidates.


5. **Conduct clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of isoflavones in cancer patients.** This is the ultimate goal of any drug development program, and it is necessary to determine whether isoflavones are safe and effective for use in humans.
