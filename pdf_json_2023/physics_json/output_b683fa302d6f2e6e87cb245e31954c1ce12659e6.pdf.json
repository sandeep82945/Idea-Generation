    "abstractText": "Aluminium adjuvants are commonly used in vaccines to stimulate the immune system, but they have limited ability to promote cellular immunity which is necessary for clearing viral infections like hepatitis B. Current adjuvants that do promote cellular immunity often have undesired side effects due to the immunostimulants they contain. In this study, a hybrid polymer lipid nanoparticle (HPLNP) was developed as an efficient adjuvant for the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine to potentiate both humoral and cellular immunity. The HPLNP is composed of FDA approved polyethylene glycol-b-poly (l-lactic acid) (PEG-PLLA) polymer and cationic lipid 1, 2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP), and can be easily prepared by a one-step method. The cationic optimised vaccine formulation HBsAg/HPLNP (w/w = 1/600) can maximise the cell uptake of the antigen due to the electrostatic adsorption between the vaccine nanoparticle and the cell membrane of antigen-presenting cells. The HPLNP prolonged the retention of the antigen at the injection site and enhanced the lymph node drainage of antigen, resulting in a higher concentration of serum anti-HBsAg IgG compared to the HBsAg group or the HBsAg/ Al group after the boost immunisation in mice. The HPLNP also promoted a strong Th1-driven immune response, as demonstrated by the significantly improved IgG2a/IgG1 ratio, increased production of IFN-\u03b3, and activation of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in the spleen and lymph nodes. Importantly, the HPLNP demonstrated no systemic toxicity during immunisation. The advantages of the HPLNP, including good biocompatibility, easy preparation, low cost, and its ability to enhance both humoral and cellular immune responses, suggest its suitability as an efficient adjuvant for protein-based vaccines such as HBsAg-VLP. These findings highlight the promising potential of the HPLNP as an HBV vaccine adjuvant, offering an alternative to aluminium adjuvants currently used in vaccines.",

            "text": "While combating the spread of infectious diseases, vaccination stands as a highly effective method for preventing hospitalization and fatality [1, 2]. Despite most marketed vaccines consisting of attenuated or inactivated pathogens, the trend is shifting towards the design of microbial subunit vaccines based on specific antigenic components from the pathogens. As microbial subunit vaccines do not contain live components of the pathogen, there is no risk of disease transmission, making them safer and more stable than vaccines containing whole pathogens [3]. Among subunit vaccines, virus-like particles (VLPs) formed by self-assembled viral proteins are highly desirable due to their exceptional immunogenicity [4, 5]. The Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines are well-known examples of VLP-based vaccines [6\u20138]. However, VLP-based vaccines face several interrelated pharmacological challenges, including rapid degradation and clearance, low accumulation in secondary lymphoid organs, and inefficient delivery of antigen to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigen processing pathway, which is crucial for inducing a CD8 + T cell response [9\u201311]. As a result, VLP-based antigens alone may not be immunogenic enough, and often require the addition of appropriate adjuvants to enhance the immune response [12].\nAdjuvants are immunomodulatory substances added to vaccines for several benefits, such as enhanced immunogenicity, antigen dose sparing, quicker immune response, prolonged duration of prophylaxis, and less booster vaccinations [13, 14]. Adjuvants act as an antigen reservoir and increase the duration of antigen presentation to immune cells. They also stimulate the recruitment and activation of antigen-presenting cells (APCs), which play a critical role in immunostimulation. APCs process vaccine antigens and transport them to draining lymph nodes, where they promote the proliferation and differentiation of T and B cells [15].\nTo date, most licensed VLP-based vaccines utilize the classic aluminium adjuvants, such as aluminium hydroxide or aluminium phosphate. These adjuvants are highly effective in enhancing antibody responses as they can adsorb antigens through electrostatic interaction, which helps to maintain the physiochemical properties and stability of the vaccine [16]. When injected, antigens that are bound with adjuvants diffuse more slowly from the site of administration, allowing antigen-presenting cells (APCs) to accumulate for better recognition, processing, and presentation of the antigens. Flach et\u00a0 al. [17] demonstrated that aluminium adjuvant could perturb the DC membrane and induce cell membrane lipid reordering without entering the cell, which further lead to antigen uptake and\nupregulation of CD4 + T cells. In 2019, global immunization coverage for the three-dose Hepatitis B vaccine reached an impressive 80% [18]. These vaccines are available as combination vaccines or single-antigen versions, with the latter commonly administered to high-risk individuals. The usage of aluminium adjuvants is widespread in recombinant Hepatitis B vaccines. In the United States, PreHevbrio, Recombivax HB, Engerix-B, and Heplislav-B are approved for use, with all except Heplislav-B utilizing aluminium adjuvants [19\u201324]. Similarly, in the United Kingdom, all three licensed Hepatitis B vaccines incorporate aluminium adjuvants [25]. In China, the recombinant Hepatitis B vaccines, including the Recombinant Hepatitis B Vaccine (Saccharomyces Cerevisiae), Recombinant Hepatitis B Vaccine (Hansenula Polymorpha), and Recombinant Hepatitis B Vaccine (CHO Cell), employ hydrated aluminium hydroxide as an adjuvant [26, 27]. However, aluminium adjuvants are usually associated with adverse reactions such as localized inflammation, pain and tenderness at the injection site, and allergic reactions, immunosuppression, and even teratogenic, carcinogenic, and mutagenic risks [28\u201333]. In some cases, they have also been linked to neurodegeneration, renal dysfunction, and the increased production of eosinophils and immunoglobulin E due to the propensity of Th2 immune bias [34]. Furthermore, substantial amounts of mechanistic studies have demonstrated that the aluminium salt-based adjuvants stimulate the Th2 immune responses, with minimum or no Th1 responses [35]. It is not ideal for viral diseases that require a Th1mediated immunity and activation of cytotoxic T cells for protection. Th1-type immune responses can be stimulated by using innate immunostimulants such as CpG oligodeoxynucleotides [36], monophosphoryl lipid A [37], and poly I: C [38], however, immunostimulants may produce adverse reactions such as autoimmune diseases while effectively inducing an immune response.\nIt has been known that Class I MHC (MHC-I) molecules present primarily endogenous antigens, i.e. antigens that are present in the cytosol and are subject to the cytosolic processing mechanisms that comprise the conventional MHC-I processing pathway, which plays important roles in generating CD8 T cell responses [39]. After phagocytic or endocytic uptake, some exogenous antigens can escape the vacuole system and penetrate into the cytosol, accessing the conventional MHC-I antigen processing mechanisms [40]. Thus, it is possible for adjuvants to deliver exogenous antigens to stimulate CD8 T cell responses by mechanisms that may contribute to the substitution of MHC-I processing pathways. The cationic delivery system with \u201csponge effect\u201d has the potential\nto allow for the exogenous antigen to escape from the endosomes and enter the cytosol for inducing CD8 + T cell responses via the MHC-I pathway [41].\nOver the past few decades, substantial research efforts have been dedicated to the development of alternative vaccine adjuvants. The development and synthesis of adjuvants to regulate the immune system and enhance vaccine efficacy have been widely studied for the improvement of vaccine design and treatment of infectious diseases. The properties of adjuvants depend largely on particle size [42], hydrophobicity [43], administration route [44], antigen release kinetics [45], and surface charge [46]. For example, positive-charged adjuvants like liposomes, cationic polymers, or emulsions interact well with negative-charged cell membranes of antigen-presenting cells (APCs), promoting the intracellular uptake of antigens [47, 48]. However, these adjuvants are often composed of multiple components and complicated to prepare, making overall quality control more complex. For instance, chitosan, a cationic polymer, acts as an adjuvant largely based on its structure, amphiphilicity, and surface charge of self-assembled structures [49]. However, the varying quality of chitosan in different batches due to its complicated synthesis can affect the immunogenicity of vaccines and limit its clinical use [50, 51]. There is a pressing need for the development of\nadjuvants which have a broad-spectrum of safety, good stability, ease of production and use, and can effectively activate humoral and cellular immune responses with no adverse reactions.\nBased on our previous work, hybrid nanoparticles provide a convenient approach for multiple functionalities and regulating properties [52, 53]. The structures and properties of hybrid nanoparticles can be easily regulated by changing the mixing ratios of different components rather than complicated synthesis. Cationic hybrid nanoparticles may be an effective vaccine adjuvant to potentiate the immune response, as they can delivery antigens and enhance the cellular uptake of antigens by APCs through electrostatic absorption. In light of the challenges posed by current vaccine adjuvants, we aim to develop a cationic hybrid polymer lipid nanoparticle (HPLNP) as an efficient vaccine adjuvant with multifaceted immune responses (Fig.\u00a0 1B). The HPLNP is composed of two FDA-approved materials: polyethylene glycol-b- poly (L-lactic acid) (PEG-PLLA) polymer and cationic lipid 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP). As shown in Fig.\u00a01A, the HPLNP can be prepared by a simple one-step method based on several minutes of mixing, stirring and organic solvent evaporation. The physicochemical properties of HPLNPs can be preciously controlled by regulating the mixing ratios of\npolymer and lipid. The size distribution, PDI, and zeta potential of HPLNPs were analysed through dynamic light scattering, and the morphology was confirmed through transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The HBsAg-VLP was used as a model antigen and mixed with the HPLNP to create vaccine formulations. Flow cytometry was applied to optimise the vaccine formulation through analysing the intracellular uptake of antigen by APCs. Finally, the in\u00a0vivo immunisation of the optimised vaccine formulation was carried out. The antigen depot effect and the lymph node drainage of the optimised vaccine formulation were studied by the small animal in\u00a0vivo imaging. The humoral responses of different formulations were compared by analysing the serum anti-HBsAg IgG concentration at specific time points. The IgG2a/IgG1 ratio was calculated to estimate the Th1/Th2 immune response trend. The secretion of cytokines in serum was evaluated by Elisa kit. Meanwhile, the activation of B cells and T cells in the spleen or lymph nodes was tested by flow cytometry. For biosafety assessment, the immunohistochemical staining of different organs and intramuscular injection sites post prime immunisation were finally analysed and the mice body weights were monitored during the immunisation."

After combining HBsAg and HPLNP at different mass ratios, several HBsAg/HPLNP formulations were obtained. Among them, the HBsAg/HPLNP (w/w = 1/600) demonstrated the highest antigen uptake without an excess of HPLNP, as shown in Fig.\u00a0 3C of \"Cellular uptake of vaccine formulations\" section. Therefore, the HBsAg/HPLNP (w/w = 1/600) formulation was selected as the representative one for characterisation here. The size distribution and zeta potential of HBsAg, HPLNP and HBsAg/ HPLNP (w/w = 1/600) have been shown in Fig.\u00a0 2A, B. The average size of the HPLNPs was 53.3 \u00b1 0.2\u00a0 nm in diameter, with a low polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.32 \u00b1 0.01 in Additional file\u00a0 1: Table\u00a0 S1. The HPLNPs had a positive surface charge, with an average zeta potential of 27.9 \u00b1 1.7\u00a0 mV. The morphology of the HPLNPs was observed through transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in Fig.\u00a0 2C, which revealed a uniform size distribution around 50\u201360\u00a0nm, consistent with the DLS data. After mixing with HBsAg antigen (35.9 \u00b1 0.8\u00a0 nm, \u2212 17.7 \u00b1 1.6\u00a0 mV), HBsAg/HPLNP formulations with different HBsAg to HPLNP mass ratios showed increased size distribution (around 57\u201375\u00a0nm) and positive surface charge (around 17\u201337\u00a0mV) in Additional file\u00a01: Table\u00a0S2. The HBsAg/HPLNP (w/w = 1/600) formulation exhibited an average size distribution around 56.7 \u00b1 0.3\u00a0 nm, which was slightly larger than that of the HPLNPs. The zeta potential of the HBsAg/HPLNP (w/w = 1/600) formulation was measured to be 33.6 \u00b1 0.7\u00a0mV as indicated in Additional file\u00a01: Table\u00a0S1. This value was lower than the zeta potential of the HPLNPs alone, but still positively charged, which is beneficial for the uptake of the formulation by APCs. Additional file\u00a01: Fig. S1 presented the UV absorption characteristics of HBsAg and HPLNP. HBsAg exhibited an absorption peak at 193\u00a0nm with an absorbance of 1.96, while HPLNP displayed a distinctive peak at 196\u00a0nm with an absorbance of 2.67. When HBsAg and HPLNP were combined in the HBsAg/HPLNP sample, a significant alteration in the UV absorption curve emerged, notably evident by the peak shift to 199\u20133\u00a0nm rightward compared to HPLNP\u2019s peak. The absorbance at 199\u00a0 nm was 2.93, notably different from the sum of their individual absorbance values (3.59). These outcomes strongly support the successful adsorption\nof HBsAg onto HPLNP\u2019s surface, as indicated by the distinctiveness of the new curve compared to the additive curve (dashed curve). Notably, the stability of the HBsAg/HPLNP formulation was maintained after storage at 4\u00a0\u00b0C for 7\u00a0days, as evidenced by the minimal deviation from the freshly prepared sample. In Additional file\u00a01: Fig. S2, the size distribution and zeta potential of the HBsAg/HPLNP formulation remained consistent at approximately 57.1 \u00b1 0.2\u00a0 nm and 33.5 \u00b1 1.3\u00a0 mV, respectively, after the 7-day storage period at 4\u00a0 \u00b0C. This negligible alteration in comparison to the freshly prepared sample, with dimensions of approximately 56.7 \u00b1 0.3\u00a0nm and a zeta potential of 33.6 \u00b1 0.7\u00a0 mV, further validated the robust stability of the HBsAg/HPLNP formulation. Additional file\u00a0 1: Fig. S3 showed the TEM graph of the HBsAg/HPLNP (w/w = 1/600) formulation. It revealed the presence of several prominent small round protrusions on the surface of the larger nanoparticles in the centre, indicating the successful surface adsorption of several smaller particles with a diameter of approximately 30\u00a0nm (HBsAg-VLP antigens). This confirmed the effective attachment of HBsAg to the surface of HPLNP."

Furthermore, the maximum cumulative release of BSA at 72\u00a0 h in the BSA/Al group and the BSA/HPLNP group was about 17.4% and 8.6%, respectively, which was significantly lower than that in the BSA group (****p < 0.0001). Meanwhile, the release of BSA in the BSA/HPLNP group was significantly lower than that in the BSA/Al group (****p < 0.0001). These results demonstrated the effective antigen absorption and depot effect of the HPLNPs. Consequently, the HPLNP showed a slower antigen release rate, increasing the likelihood of antigen presentation and subsequent cellular uptake by APCs. These findings suggest that the HPLNP may offer advantages over the Al adjuvant in terms of its ability to facilitate antigen presentation and cellular uptake."

The results indicated that the cell viability of RAW264.7 cells decreased as the concentration of HBsAg/HPLNP formulation increase. While an evident decrease in cell viability was noted in the HBsAg/HPLNP group with increasing HBsAg concentration, no statistically significant disparity was observed between the HBsAg/HPLNP and HBsAg/ Al groups in Fig.\u00a02E. Importantly, the cytotoxicity associated with HPLNP remained within acceptable limits and over 50% of cells exhibited sustained viability even at elevated concentrations. Additional file\u00a01: Fig. S5 demonstrated the cell viability of mouse spleen lymphocyte after treatment with different formulations. A similar trend was observed in comparison with the cell viability results obtained with RAW264.7 cells. The trend showed an increase in toxicity of HBsAg/HPLNP on splenocytes with higher concentrations. However, no significant difference was noted when compared to the Al adjuvant. The increased cytotoxicity was due to the positive charge accompanied with the HPLNPs. It is encouraging that\nHPLNPs had a negligible haemolysis rate of less than 5%, which was significantly lower than that of Al adjuvant (*p < 0.05). These results demonstrated that the HPLNP had low cytotoxicity and favourable biocompatibility, making it possible for further in\u00a0vivo studies."

            "heading": "Cellular uptake of\u00a0vaccine formulations",
            "text": "Antigen cellular uptake by APCs is the basis of the protective immune response mechanism in vaccination. Furthermore, cytoplasmic delivery of antigens is crucial for the induction of antigen-specific immune responses. It is well known that soluble antigens alone are poorly effective in protective immunity, mainly because of quick degradation and insufficient cellular uptake by APCs. Thus, adjuvants can make the vaccine more immunogenic by protecting antigen and promoting its cell uptake by APCs (Fig.\u00a0 3A). Herein, we formulated vaccine formulations using FITC-HBsAg adsorbed to HPLNPs and investigated the cellular uptake of formulations with different components in RAW264.7 cells using flow cytometry. Due to the positive charge of HPLNPs, HBsAg/HPLNPs formulations had a stronger electrostatic attraction to the negatively charged cell membrane, leading to a significantly higher cellular uptake compared to HBsAg alone. In Fig.\u00a03B, only ~ 10.4% of cells in the HBsAg group were FITC-positive, while nearly all of the cells (~ 98.9%) in the HBsAg/HPLNP (w/w) = 1/600 group were FITC-positive. When the mass ratio of HPLNP to HBsAg reached 600, a significantly higher percentage of FITC-positive cells (***p < 0.001) and intracellular MFI (****p < 0.0001) were observed compared with the HBsAg/HPLNP (w/w = 1/400) group. Meanwhile, the percentage of FITC-positive cells and the intracellular MFI were kept stationary when the mass ratio of HPLNP to HBsAg exceeded 600, indicating the saturation of the adjuvant effect of HPLNP. It convincingly demonstrated that the cellular uptake of HBsAg increases with an increase in the amount of HPLNPs in Fig.\u00a0 3C, D. The fluorescence confocal microscope images also confirmed that the HPLNP significantly enhanced the cellular uptake of HBsAg when the mass ratio of HPLNP to HBsAg reached 600. This was evident from the higher intracellular fluorescence intensity observed in the HBsAg/HPLNP group as compared to the HBsAg group in Fig.\u00a03E. We postulated that the maximum cellular uptake of the antigen could be achieved using the HPLNP formulation with an optimised adjuvant/antigen mass ratio of around 600. Henceforth, the terms \u201cHBsAg/HPLNP\u201d formulations mentioned hereafter will pertain to the adjuvant/antigen mass ratio of 600, unless explicitly stated otherwise.\nTypically, ingested antigens undergo degradation into short peptide fragments within the acidic intracellular environment due to enzymatic activity. This process\nleads to the formation of MHC II-antigen complexes on APCs, subsequently presented to CD4 + T cells, thus initiating humoral immune responses [56]. After incubation with HBsAg, HBsAg/Al or HBsAg/HPLNP formulation for 24\u00a0 h, flow cytometry was employed to assess the cell surface expression of MHC II molecules. Additional file\u00a01: Fig. S4 revealed a conspicuously elevated proportion of MHC II positive cells within the HBsAg/HPLNP group, in comparison to the HBsAg (****p < 0.0001) and HBsAg/Al (****p < 0.0001) groups. This disparity exhibited statistical significance, underscoring the capability of the HPLNP adjuvant to significantly augment the antigen presentation process.\nInjection site antigen depot and\u00a0lymph node drainage One possible mechanism by which adjuvants improve the immune response is by prolonging the retention of antigen at the injection site and enhancing lymph node drainage. Images obtained showed varying rates of antigen diffusion at the injection site among the HBsAg, HBsAg/ Al, and HBsAg/HPLNP groups (Fig.\u00a0 4A). The HBsAg group exhibited faster antigen diffusion compared to the HBsAg/Al and HBsAg/HPLNP groups, as evidenced by a larger fluorescence area after injection for 12\u00a0h. The HBsAg/HPLNP group retained the antigen at the injection site for up to 72\u00a0h with a much lower diffusion speed than that in HBsAg group, suggesting that HPLNPs effectively prolonged the antigen depot and reduced antigen diffusion. While fluorescence signals were still detectable at the injection site of HBsAg and HBsAg/Al groups 72\u00a0h post-injection, and their mean fluorescence intensities were significantly lower compared to the HBsAg/HPLNP group (as shown in Fig.\u00a04B). Within 12 to 72\u00a0h after the injection, the MFI of the HBsAg group decreased slowly (from 1.45 \u00d7 108 to 1.17 \u00d7 108) and the HBsAg/Al group showed little change (around 1.31\u20131.45 \u00d7 108). While the MFI of the HBsAg/HPLNP group at 72\u00a0h (2.08 \u00d7 108) was even higher than that at 12\u00a0h (1.72 \u00d7 108). This finding may be attributed to the strong antigen depot effect of HPLNPs, which efficiently condensed the antigen at the injection site and released it slowly over time. The observed increase in fluorescence was likely due to the gradual release of the antigen from the injected muscle site, further indicating that HPLNPs enhance and prolong the antigen depot effect, which is beneficial for enhancing the antigen uptake by APCs and the following immune response. Meanwhile, the fluorescence of the lymph node in HBsAg/HPLNP group at 12\u00a0h was obviously higher than that of the HBsAg (**p < 0.01) or HBsAg/Al (***p < 0.001)\ngroup, indicating a faster and stronger antigen drainage to the mesenteric lymph node (Fig.\u00a0 4C). On the other hand, there was a reduction in the signal observed at the lymph nodes after 48\u00a0 h, which was most likely due to the absorption of the vaccine nanoparticles into the lymphatic capillaries in the subcutaneous tissue. These nanoparticles were then transported into the lymph nodes, where the HBsAg could have been taken up by lymphocytes and broken down by the APCs. Over time, the antigen would be distributed throughout the circulatory and lymphatic system, resulting in a decrease in the signal observed at the lymph nodes (Fig.\u00a04D). Despite a decrease in fluorescence intensity over time, the HBsAg/ HPLNP group exhibited much higher fluorescence intensity in the lymph nodes compared to the HBsAg/ Al group after 72\u00a0 h (*p < 0.05). These results provide evidence for the advantages of HPLNP as an adjuvant, which include prolonging the antigen depot at the injection site, enhancing antigen lymph node drainage, and decreasing antigen diffusion. Moreover, the degradation of active vaccine constituents can result in functional loss, primarily attributed to enzymatic degradation causing a decline in antigen effectiveness. Al adjuvants aid in diminishing antigen degradation via the \"antigen depot effect\", curtailing antigen release kinetics and minimizing interaction with endogenous enzymes [57]. Similarly, electrostatic interactions facilitated the successful absorption of HBsAg-VLP antigen onto HPLNP, yielding a stable nanoformulation supported by DLS data in Fig.\u00a0 2A, B. Hence, the HPLNP-induced \"antigen depot effect\" might also attenuate HBsAg degradation. Furthermore, PEGylation, whether via chemical conjugation or nanoparticle encapsulation, has been demonstrated to heighten protein colloidal stability in numerous investigations [58, 59]. Drawing from our prior findings, nanoparticle PEGylation concurrently reduces serum protein adsorption [52, 53], thereby mitigating enzyme-HBsAg interactions. Consequently, the PEGylated HBsAg/ HPLNP formulation could mitigate HBsAg enzymatic degradation."

            "heading": "In vivo immunisation",
            "text": "Based on the promising results of cellular uptake and lymph node drainage, an in\u00a0 vivo immunization study was conducted using the schematic procedure shown in Fig.\u00a0 6A. The production of anti-HBsAg IgG tended to increase over time after the three intramuscular\ninjections. The HBsAg/HPLNP group had considerably higher anti-HBsAg IgG concentration than the HBsAg and HBsAg/Al groups after the prime immunisation on Day 14 (Fig.\u00a06B). After the first boost, the HBsAg/HPLNP group induced significantly higher anti-HBsAg IgG level compared to the HBsAg alone (*p < 0.05) or HBsAg/Al group (*p < 0.05) on Day 21 (Fig.\u00a0 6C). After the second boost, the anti-HBsAg IgG concentration of the HBsAg/ HPLNP group was still significantly higher than that of the HBsAg group on Day 35 (**p < 0.01, Fig.\u00a0 6D) and Day 42 (*p < 0.05, Fig.\u00a0 6E). These results indicated that the HPLNP adjuvant can induce a quicker and stronger humoral immune response (Th2 type) than the pure HBsAg group and Al adjuvant.\nFurthermore, a preferred adjuvant should promote both Th1 and Th2 responses. The Th1-type immune response is particularly important especially in chronic virus-related diseases like Hepatitis B virus infection. However, the frequently used Al adjuvants are biased towards a Th2-driven response. Then we analysed the anti-HBsAg IgG2a/IgG1 ratio to evaluate the ability of HPLNPs adjuvant for inducing a Th1-driven response. In Fig.\u00a0 6F, the concentrations of anti-HBsAg IgG1 isotype related to the humoral response (Th2) were similar in all groups after three injections on Day 42. However, the anti-HBsAg IgG2a reflecting the T cell activation (Th1) in HBsAg/HPLNPs group was significantly higher than that in HBsAg (** p < 0.01) or HBsAg/Al group (**p < 0.01) (Fig.\u00a0 6G). The anti-HBsAg IgG2a/IgG1 ratio of HBsAg/ HPLNP group was much higher than HBsAg group or HBsAg/Al group (**p < 0.01), while the HBsAg/Al group even reduced the IgG2a/IgG1 ratio compared to the pure HBsAg in Fig.\u00a06H (**p < 0.01). These results prove that the HPLNP is effective than Al adjuvant in stimulating the Th1-driven immune response, which correlates to the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) reactions.\nExcept for the antibody analysis, we also tested the serum cytokine secretion. In Fig.\u00a0 7A, the secretion of IL-6 in HBsAg/HPLNP group was obviously higher than that in HBsAg/Al group (*p < 0.05), which confirmed the promotion of humoral immunity by HPLNPs, as IL-6 plays an important role in B cell proliferation, differentiation and antibody production. Also, both the HBsAg/ HPLNP and HBsAg/Al groups had a much higher IL-4 production than the HBsAg group, which further confirmed the HPLNPs can induce a Th2-driven response as effectively as Al adjuvant (Fig.\u00a0 7B). Meanwhile, the HPLNPs significantly enhanced the serum concentration of IFN-\u03b3 than the HBsAg or HBsAg/Al groups, emphasizing the strong Th1 driving effect (Fig.\u00a0 7C). It was because IFN-\u03b3 was the typical cytokine secreted by Th1 or CD8 + T cells. This result made a good correlation with the IgG2a/IgG1 results in Fig.\u00a06H. Besides, the\ncytokine of Gzms-B was also analysed (Fig.\u00a0 7D). Taken together, the HPLNP adjuvant can effectively improve the Th2 immune responses but also has a strong propensity to induce the Th1 immune response, which was more advantageous than the aluminium adjuvant. Antigens typically degrade within the acidic and enzymatic environment of endosomes, generating short peptide fragments. These peptides subsequently interact with MHC-II molecules, forming MHC-II-antigen complexes transported to the cell surface, engaging CD4 + T cells for humoral immune responses. Exogenous antigens can access the MHC-I pathway through cytoplasmic processing and cross-presentation, wherein APCs process antigens into short peptides presented to CD8 + T cells, activating cellular immunity [60]. This cross-presentation is pivotal for robust immune responses against intracellular pathogens. Positively charged HPLNP induces a \"proton sponge effect\", aiding endosomal escape and antigen cytoplasmic delivery. Thus, this potentially leads to MHC-I-antigen complex formation, fostering cellular immunity activation.\nIntracellular cytokines secretion, activation and\u00a0proliferation of\u00a0splenocytes As the spleen is the most significant immune organ, we evaluated the activation of splenocytes and the intracellular cytokine secretion. After restimulated with HBsAg for 48\u00a0h, the number of IFN-\u03b3 secreting CD8 + T splenocytes in HBsAg/HPLNP group was significantly higher than that of the HBsAg or HBsAg/Al groups, indicating\na preference for cellular immune response (Fig.\u00a08A). For instance, a maximum of 1.5-fold or 1.67-fold of spots number could be observed for the HBsAg/HPLNP group, in comparison to the HBsAg group (*p < 0.05) or HBsAg/ Al group (**p < 0.01), respectively (Fig.\u00a08B). Furthermore, we observed a significantly higher antigen-specific proliferation of splenocytes in the HBsAg/HPLNP group than that in the HBsAg group at both 24\u00a0 h (*p < 0.05) and 48\u00a0 h (**p < 0.01) post-re-stimulation with HBsAg antigen (Fig.\u00a0 8C). Meanwhile, the activation of splenocytes including B cell and T cell were also analysed. The percentage of CD69 + CD19 + B cells in HBsAg/ HPLNP group was obviously higher than that of Al adjuvant in Fig.\u00a0 8D (*p < 0.05). No significant difference was observed in the CD69 + /CD4 + T cells among these groups (Fig.\u00a0 8E). However, both the CD69 + /CD8 + T and FasL + /CD8 + T cells in the HBsAg/HPLNP group were significantly increased compared to the HBsAg or the HBsAg/Al group, respectively (Fig.\u00a0 8F, G). It confirmed that the HBsAg/HPLNP group had great advantages in activating the cytotoxic T cells. Taken together, these results demonstrated the superior ability of HPLNP in potentiating both humoral immunity and cellular immunity."

            "text": "Here we developed a novel hybrid polymer lipid nanoparticle (HPLNP) as the HBsAg-VLP vaccine adjuvant. The HPLNP was composed of two FDA-approved materials, and can be prepared by a simple one-pot method based on several minutes of mixing, stirring and organic solvent evaporation. The optimised formulation with the mass ratio of HBsAg/HPLNP = 1/600 significantly improved the antigen cellular uptake by APCs. The optimised HBsAg/HPLNP formulation largely enhanced the antigen depot effect and prolonged the duration of antigen at the injection site. The lymph node drainage of antigen assisted by HPLNPs was obviously faster and higher compared to the use of Al adjuvant. Therefore, the serum anti-HBsAg IgG concentration of HBsAg/HPLNP group was much higher than the pure HBsAg group or HBsAg/ Al group after the boost immunisation in mice. Even after the second boost, the final anti-HBsAg IgG production of the HBsAg/HPLNP group was obviously higher\nthan the HBsAg group. Except for the effective humoral immunity, the markedly improved IgG2a/IgG1 of HPLNP group indicated a strong propensity for HPLNP to induce the Th1-driven immune response. Meanwhile, the elevated IL-4 and IL-6 secretion of HBsAg/HPLNP group further confirmed the improved humoral immunity as they were important in the B cell proliferation, differentiation and antibody production. Furthermore, the HPLNP enhanced the production of IFN-\u03b3 and FasL + /CD8+ T cells, which was obviously higher than the commercial Al adjuvant, emphasising the strong cellular immune stimulating effect. Last but not the least, there was limited systematic toxicity during the whole immunization in the HPLNPs group, demonstrated by the immunohistochemistry and mice body weights evaluation. Therefore, our newly developed HPLNP adjuvant, which offers advantages including good biocompatibility, easy preparation, low cost and the ability to improve both humoral and cellular immunity, would be a potential alternative to the aluminium adjuvant.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1186/ s12951- 023- 02116-6.\nAdditional file\u00a01: Table\u00a0S1.
