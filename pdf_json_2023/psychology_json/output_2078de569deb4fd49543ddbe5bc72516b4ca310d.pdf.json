            "text": "ammonia. Nitrogenase is tightly inhibited by the environmental gas carbon monoxide (CO). Many nitrogen fixing bacteria protect nitrogenase from CO inhibition using the protective protein CowN. This work demonstrates that a conserved glutamic acid residue near CowN\u2019s C-terminus is necessary for its function. Mutation of the glutamic acid residue abolishes both CowN\u2019s protection against CO inhibition and CowN\u2019s ability to bind to nitrogenase. In contrast, a conserved Cterminal cysteine residue is not important for CO protection. Overall, this work uncovers structural features in CowN that are required for its function and provides new insights into its nitrogenase binding and CO protection mechanism.\nMAIN TEXT:\nNitrogenase is the only enzyme capable of reducing dinitrogen gas (N2) into ammonia (NH3). It consists of two components proteins, the molybdenum iron protein (MoFeP) and the iron protein (FeP). MoFeP contains two metal clusters, the FeMoco, a [7Fe:9S:1Mo:1C] cluster that is the site of catalysis, and the [8Fe:7S] P-cluste.1, 2 FeP is a reductase that contains a [4Fe:4S] cluster. During nitrogen reduction, FeP sequentially delivers electron to MoFeP in an ATP-dependent process (Equation 1).\n\ud835\udc41! + 16 \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc43 + 8 \ud835\udc52# + 8\ud835\udc3b$ \u2192 2\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc3b% +\ud835\udc3b! + 16\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc43 + 16\ud835\udc43& (Equation 1)\nMolybdenum nitrogenase, the most common isoform of the enzyme, is inactivated by the environmental gas carbon monoxide (CO), which acts as a mixed inhibitor.3, 4 CO is produced anthropogenically during the combustion of fossil fuels, through natural geochemical and biological processes in the soil,5-7 and by plants, which use it is a signaling gas.8, 9 While CO potently inhibits nitrogenase in vitro, diazotrophs tolerate the gas quite well. The inhibition constants, Kis and Kii, are in the range of 1-2 \ud835\uddd1 10-4 atm and 1-2 \ud835\uddd1 10-3 atm, respectively, in vitro 3, 10, 11. In contrast, when nitrogenase activity is measured in vivo in diazotrophs the constants are an order of magnitude higher.3\nIn many \u03b1-proteobacteria, nitrogenase is protected by a small protein called CowN. Rhodobacter capsulatus12 and Rhodospirillum rubrum13 are able to grow diaoztrophically in 1% and 0.15% (0.01 atm and 0.0015 atm) CO, respectively, without apparent growth inhibition. However, when cowN in knocked out in either bacterium, diazotophic growth is nearly nonexistant, suggesting that cowN is vital in maintaining nitrogenase activity under CO. Our group recently described the mechanism of CowN protection in the diazotroph Gluconacetobacter\ndiazotrophicus (Gd). CowN binds to MoFeP and increases the inhibition constant for CO-binding about 10-fold.10 There was no evidence that CowN alters the structure of FeMoco, nor does CowN have any activity of its own, leading to the hypothesis that CowN prevents CO from reaching FeMoco. CowN specifically prevents CO binding, as it does not prevent the alternative substrate acetylene (C2H2) from reaching the active site. While we were able to determine that CowN and MoFeP interact, the binding surface on either protein is unknown. This goal of this work is to identify structural features in CowN that are important for its function and for MoFeP binding. Mutagenesis and crosslinking data suggest that a glutamate residue near CowN\u2019s C-terminus is necessary for CowN activity, however that a conserved cysteine residue is not essential for CO protection.\nOur group previously examined nitrogenase protection by CowN using the common model substrate C2H2 .10 Since the mechanism of C2H2 and N2 reduction are different,14-16 we wanted to\ndetermine if CowN protects nitrogenase under N2 turnover. As shown in Figure 1, CowN prevents CO inhibition when N2 is the substrate. The amount of protection for N2 and C2H2 reduction is nearly identical, suggesting that CowN\u2019s protective mechanism is likely the same for both gases. The result is consistent with our proposal that CowN blocks CO access to FeMoco and thus protects nitrogenase turnover for all substrates. Furthermore, these results directly explain the observations by Masepohl et al.,12 and Kerby et al.13 who demonstrated that CowN sustained diazotrophic growth in presence of CO.\nCowN is predicted to be a compact, 13 kDa 4-helical bundle. CowN\u2019s primary sequence is not particularly conserved, however, it commonly features a negatively charged C-terminal end that contains several Glu and Asp residues (Figure 2A and 2B). In Gd-CowN, the protein is polar with a negatively charged C-terminus and a more positively charged N-terminus (Figure 2C). A second conserved feature in CowN is the presence of a C-terminal sulfur containing residue (Figure 2A and 2B). CowN features a sulfur containing amino acid as either the penultimate or final residue. The residue is usually a Cys. In some cases, there are two thiol containing residues at the Cterminus, as is the case in Gd-CowN which ends in Cys90-Met91.\nThe conservation of acidic and sulfur-containing residues at CowN\u2019s C-terminus suggests functional relevance. To examine the importance of the negative C-terminus, we targeted Glu87, the only fully conserved residue in CowN, for mutagenesis, generating the E87A, E87D, and E87Q mutants. Furthermore, we investigated the role of the C-terminal Cys and Met residues by making a C90A, C90S, and M91A mutant as well as a C-terminally truncated version of CowN that lacks the final two residues (referred to as C-trunc CowN).\nMutant expression and purification were identical to WT CowN. All three E87 mutants and both C90 mutants expressed to similar levels as wild type, yielding approximately 3-4 mg protein per liter of growth media. Circular dichroism (CD) analysis suggests that the Glu87 and Cys90 mutants are folded \u03b1-helical proteins, as expected, (Figure 2A) and are identical to WT CowN. In contrast, M91A and C-trunc CowN expressed at lower levels (0.5-1 mg per liter of growth media). Most of the protein was present as a misfolded aggregate, however, a small amount of monomeric protein could be separated from the aggregate by gel filtration chromatography. CD spectra of monomeric M91A and C-trunc CowN indicates that the protein is less folded than wild-type CowN (Figure 2B). This suggests that residue Met91 is important for CowN stability. However, the reason for this is unclear. Met91 is not conserved. Structural modeling suggests that M91A CowN should be nearly identical to WT CowN (Figure S1). CowN has no predicted posttranslational modifications or ligand binding sites that would depend on Cys90 or Met91, and we did not detect modifications to either residue by mass spectrometry. Met91 is predicted to point towards the hydrophobic center of CowN (Figure S1). We therefore hypothesize that it may play a role in stabilizing hydrophobic packing between CowN\u2019s \u03b1-helices.\nTo test the role of the conserved residue Glu87, we carried out turnover experiments with acetylene. These experiments were conducted with a CO concentration of 0.02 atm, which\nabolishes approximately 90% of nitrogenase activity in absence of CowN. Consistent with previous reports,10 WT CowN leads to a partial rescue of activity to 30% of the uninhibited level (Figure 2C). E87A, E87D, and E87Q CowN do not protect nitrogenase from CO. Their levels of protection are within error of samples that do not have CowN and of an unfolded CowN negative control. Additionally, we investigated if E87A is able to recover nitrogenase activity if it is present in higher concentrations (Figure S2). However, recovery increased only slightly when the E87A CowN concentration was increased to 4 \u03bc\u039c (the highest amount that could be tested in our experimental setup), suggesting that the mutation is deleterious enough that it cannot be overcome by increasing the CowN concentration.\nBoth M91A and C-trunc CowN do not protect nitrogenase from CO inhibition (Figure 3D). This result was expected, given the fact that both mutants are partially unfolded. In contrast, both C90S and C90A CowN protect nitrogenase to the same degree as WT CowN (Figure 3D). Taken together, these data suggest that CowN function depends on residue Glu87 and that even mild substitutions to Gln and and Asp are not tolerated. At the same time, the data suggests that the conserved C-terminal Cys is not required for CO protection.\nWe hypothesize that the loss of CO protection in the Glu87 mutants is caused by a decreased affinity for MoFeP, as Glu87 may form a salt bridge with a positively charged MoFeP residue. To test this hypothesis, we carried out crosslinking experiments with diazirine labeled MoFeP. In this experiment, MoFeP is first labeled at Lys residues with a photoactivatable diazirine crosslinker using NHS-ester chemistry. The diazirine crosslinker then binds covalently to interacting proteins under illumination. We had previously used this method to determine that MoFeP interacts with WT CowN.10 As shown in Figure 3A and 3B, WT CowN and MoFeP form a diazirine-mediated crosslink band at 70 kDa. A representative MoFeP and CowN peptide peak from an excised crosslink band that was tryptically digested and analyzed by mass spectrometry is shown Figure 3C. Furthermore, a list of peptides belonging to WT CowN and MoFeP from the excised crosslink band and a sequence coverage map are shown in Tables S1-S3. The crosslinking band intensity for E87D and E87Q CowN is weaker than for the wild type, and E87A CowN does not crosslink at all (Figure 3A). These data support the hypothesis that Glu87 is important in mediating proteinprotein interactions with MoFeP. We also examined crosslinking of C90A and M91A CowN with diazirine-labeled MoFeP (Figure 3B). M91A did not crosslink with MoFeP, suggesting that its partially unfolded state prevents it from interacting with MoFeP. In contrast, C90A CowN bound to MoFeP, adding further evidence that mutations at residue Cys90 do not impair CowN function. Taken together, the crosslinking and turnover data are consistent with each other and suggest that residue Glu87 is important for CowN function as it is required for protein-protein interaction with MoFeP.\nGlu87 likely enables CowN to bind to MoFeP through ionic interactions with positively charged residues on MoFeP. Such electrostatic interactions may occur at the opening of a putative CO channel between the \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits, which is lined by four Lys residues.10, 14 This potential binding site is compatible with diazirine crosslinking results since the diazirine crosslinker is bound to MoFeP at a Lys residue. While the hypothesis that CowN blocks the mouth of a putative CO channel makes mechanistic sense, further work is needed to confirm this site. We carried out additional mass spectrometry experiments with different mass detectors and using methods for finding large peptides, however, we were unable to find peaks corresponding to crosslinked peptide pairs. The most likely explanation for the lack of detection is the low abundance of\ncrosslinked peptide fragments and their large size. A possible solution to overcome this problem is to utilize a cleavable heterobifunctional diazirine crosslinker to detect binding sites using MS3 methods.19, 20 However, such crosslinkers are not yet commercially available.\nOverall, the data presented herein suggests that CowN\u2019s negatively charged C-terminal is important for CowN binding to MoFeP and protection against CO inhibition. At the same time, this work raises the question about the role of the C-terminal Cys. We previously speculated, that CowN may have additional roles in nitrogen fixation that are unrelated to CO protection since CowN is upregulated under all nitrogen fixation conditions, not just when CO is present.10 Independently, other researchers have implicated CowN in nitrogenase cold protection.21, 22 Our group intends on investigating CowN further to uncover the full gamut of its roles in bacterial nitrogen fixation and to unambiguously determine where it interacts with MoFeP."
