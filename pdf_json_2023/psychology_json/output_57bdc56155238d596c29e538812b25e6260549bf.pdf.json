    "abstractText": "Novel core\u2013shell magnetic molecularly imprinted polymers (MMIPs) were synthesized using the sol\u2013gel method for the adsorption of cefixime (CFX). Fe3O4@SiO2 is the core, and molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are the shell, which can selectively interact with CFX. The preparation conditions, adsorption kinetics, adsorption isotherms, selective adsorption ability, and reutilization performance of the MMIPs were investigated. The adsorption capacity of MMIPs for CFX was 111.38 mg/g, which was about 3.5 times that of MNIPs. The adsorption equilibrium time was 180 min. The dynamic adsorption experiments showed that the adsorption process of MMIPs to CFX conformed to the pseudo-second-order model. Through static adsorption study, the Scatchard analysis showed that MMIPs had two types of binding sites\u2014the high-affinity binding sites and the low-affinity binding sites\u2014while the Langmuir model fit the adsorption isotherms well (R2 = 0.9962). Cefepime and ceftiofur were selected as the structural analogs of CFX for selective adsorption studies; the adsorption of CFX by MMIPs was higher than that of other structural analogs; and the imprinting factors of CFX, cefepime, and ceftiofur were 3.5, 1.7, and 1.4, respectively. Furthermore, the MMIPs also showed excellent reusable performance.",

            "text": "Cefixime (CFX), an important \u03b2-lactam ring antibiotic, is mainly used to treat throat infections, gonorrhea, and pneumonia [1,2]. Advantages such as strong antibacterial activity and good efficacy have enabled the wide use of CFX in the treatment of diseases in humans, poultry, and aquaculture [3,4]. However, its frequent use has raised concerns over harm to both the environment and human health. In the production process of CFX, the separation, extraction, purification, and other processes will produce high-concentration organic wastewater. CFX has been detected in the water and soil of many countries and regions; for example, high concentrations of CFX were found in hospital wastewater in Bangladesh [5], which is difficult to treat due to its strong polarity and biological enrichment [6]. At present, the removal technologies of CFX in the environment mainly include physical separation, biodegradation, chemical oxidation, etc. [7\u20139]. Vajihe Hasanzadeh et al. used metal hydroxide to activate jujube fruit residue at high temperature, which adsorbed CFX based on physical separation [10]. Physical separation is complex, requires high temperature, and has poor specificity for pollutants. Abotaleb Bay et al. developed a biofilm reactor for treating CFX in wastewater. The degradation rate could reach 70.9% at 92 mg/L, but the degradation efficiency was reduced to 34.8% at 122 mg/L [11]. In the process of biodegradation, there are disadvantages; for example, toxic substances may be produced, and rigorous temperature conditions are required. The operation cost of chemical oxidation is high, the operation is complicated, and toxic products may still be produced\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4464. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym15224464 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4464 2 of 14\nafter degradation. For example, Hasani et al. degraded CFX in water via the ultrasonic and electric Fenton method, but the cost was high, the operation was complicated, and toxic products might still have been produced after degradation [12]. Therefore, it is necessary to design a low-cost material, which can identify CFX in complex systems. MIPs are synthetic materials with a specific selection of target molecules [13], which, owing to their imprinted site, are complementary to the target molecules in shape and size [14,15], vividly described as artificially synthesized tailor-made polymers [16,17]. MIPs benefit from excellent properties, such as prominent selectivity, strong anti-interference ability, and convenient synthesis [18\u201320]. They have application opportunities in solid phase extraction, controlled drug release, sensors, and catalysis [21,22]. However, the use of traditional MIPs includes obstacles related to their low binding capacity and mass transfer [23\u201325]. By designing the molecular recognition sites on the surface of imprinted materials, the surface molecular imprinting technology improves the mass transfer between the recognition sites and target molecules, facilitates the elution and recombination of template molecules, improves the recognition efficiency and binding speed, and avoids the disadvantages of traditional methods. The molecular imprinting technique of graft on the surface of a carrier has been extensively studied. The commonly used carriers include SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3, magnetic nanomaterials, etc. Shichao Ding et al. designed and synthesized peptide-imprinted mesoporous silica using a combination of the sol\u2013gel method and molecular imprinting technology to specifically identify an immunostimulating hexapeptide from human casein; the adsorption capacity was 60.5 mg/g, and the imprinting factor was 4.51 [26]. In terms of the application effect, magnetic nanoparticles have received attention due to their good dispersion, controllability, small size, and excellent superparamagnetism [27,28]. MMIPs can not only specifically adsorb target molecules in a complex environment, but they can also be quickly separated by an external magnetic field, thus avoiding steps such as centrifugation, resulting in low cost, mild conditions, reducing material waste, and improving work efficiency [29,30]. Fatemeh Mirzapour et al. prepared the MMIPs of dextromethorphan via precipitation polymerization using Fe3O4@SiO2-C=C as the carrier and applied them to highly selective solid phase extraction; the recovery was 92\u201397%, and the adsorption capacity was 114.8 mg/g [31]. Chaoren Yan et al. used Fe3O4@SiO2 as the carrier and developed a combination of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), imprinting technology, and magnetic nanoparticles to obtain a somewhat promising nanomaterial (MINs@EGCG) for amyloid inhibition, drug carrier, and facile separation triple functions; the cleansing efficiency was up to 80% [32]. Shikha Bhogal et al. prepared MMIPs for phthalate adsorption via surface imprinting using Fe3O4@SiO2 as a carrier; the recovery was 88.53\u2013121.57%, with LOD ranging from 0.01 to 0.03 ng/mL [33]. Ziyang Lu et al. prepared a magnetic imprinted PEDOT/CdS nanoreactor for the adsorption and degradation of danofloxacin mesylate through the microwave-assisted surface imprinting technique, with a degradation rate of 84%; the adsorption capacity was 1.41 mg/g [34]. Mir Muhammad Gaho et al. prepared the MMIPs for norfloxacin adsorption through radical polymerization using oleic-coated Fe3O4 as the carrier, and the maximum adsorption capacity was 42.34 mg/g at 35 \u25e6C [35]. Ziyang Li et al. prepared the MMIPs for sulfamethoxazole using Fe-Mn impregnated peanut shell biochar as a functional monomer by using surface molecular imprinting technology, with a maximum adsorption capacity of 25.65 mg/g and an imprinting factor of 1.34 [36]. Notably, there are few reports on the adsorption of CFX on MMIPs, which is where our work was focused. In this work, the sol\u2013gel method was introduced to imprint molecules into the inorganic network structures to form a rigid structure. Compared with precipitation polymerization, radical polymerization, and other methods, this method is simple in operation, easy to control, and low cost [31,37\u201339]. Fe3O4@SiO2 was the core, and MIPs were used as the shell; silica was used as the intermediate carrier to connect the magnetic particles and the organic layer. CFX was used as the template, 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) as a functional monomer, and tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) as a crosslinker to be imprinted on\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4464 3 of 14\nthe surface of Fe3O4@SiO2 with the sol\u2013gel method. Thus, MMIPs with core\u2013shell were prepared and showed high selectivity toward CFX."

Subsequently, 0.2 g Fe3O4 was dispersed in a 125 mL solution of ethanol and ultrapure water (4:1, v/v), after which 1.8 mL NH3\u00b7H2O and 0.6 mL TEOS were added; the material was dried at 60 \u25e6C for 10 h in a vacuum to obtain Fe3O4@SiO2.\n2.3.2. Synthesis of MMIPs and MNIPs\nAmounts of 0.135 g CFX, 0.420 mL APTES, and 30 mL methanol were mixed and stirred; then, amounts of 2.67 mL TEOS, 0.20 g Fe3O4@SiO2, and 1 mL acetic acid (1 mol/L) were added, and the mixture was stirred for 10 h. The mixture was then separated with magnets, washed repeatedly, and dried. A mixture of methanol/acetic acid (9:1, v/v) was used to elute CFX from the MMIPs until there was no UV-Vis adsorption at 288 nm. Then, the MMIPs were vacuum-dried at 60 \u25e6C for 10 h. The MNIPs were prepared without CFX but using the same protocol.\n2.4. Binding Experiments 2.4.1. Static Adsorption\nAn amount of 5 mg of MMIPs or MNIPs was added to a 10 mL CFX\u2013methanol solution of 10\u2013200 mg/L, which was shaken for 180 min; magnets were used for separation, and the absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 288 nm with UV-Vis.

Adsorption Properties of MMIPs and MNIPs 3.4.1. Dynamic Adsorption\nThe adsorption kinetics of MMIPs and MNIPs were determined (Figure 8a), revealing that MMIPs could rapidly adsorb CFX in less than 150 min, after which the rate of adsorp-\ntion capacity growth gradually decreased, finally reaching saturation after 180 min. Since\nthere were imprinted sites on the surface of MMIPs at the initial stage of adsorption, CFX\nwas rapidly adsorbed. After 180 min, an increasing number of binding sites were occupied, and the mass transfer of CFX in solution to the internal pores was subject to resistance. The adsorption capacity of MMIPs was approximately 3.52 times higher than MNIPs because CFX was not involved in the preparation of MNIPs; as such, there were no specific recognition holes or imprinting sites. The adsorption of CFX by MNIPs was mainly caused by non-specific adsorption of van der Waals force and other forces. To study the mass transfer mechanism of polymer-adsorbed CFX, the equilibrium data were fitted using the two models of pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order binding as follows [50]:\nln(Qe \u2212 Qt) = lnQe \u2212 k1t (3)\nt Qt = t Qe + 1 k2Qe 2 (4)\nwhere Qe is the adsorption equilibrium capacity of MMIPs or MNIPs, and Qt is the adsorption capacity at time t; t (min) is the adsorption time; and k1 (min\u22121) and k2 (mg g\u22121 min\u22121) are the pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order rate constants of adsorption,\nrespectively.\nThe fitted data are shown in Table 1; the pseudo-second-order model (Figure 8c) was\nFigure 7.

Dynamic Adsorption\nThe adsorption kinetics of MMIPs and MNIPs were determined (Figure 8a), revealing that MMIPs could rapidly adsorb CFX in less than 150 min, after which the rate of\nadsorption capacity growth gradually decreased, finally reaching saturation after 180 min.\nSince there were imprinted sites on the surface of MMIPs at the initial stage of adsorption,\nCFX was rapidly adsorbed. After 180 min, an increasing number of binding sites were occupied, and the mass transfer of CFX in solution to the internal pores was subject to resistance. The adsorption capacity of MMIPs was approximately 3.52 times higher than MNIPs because CFX was not involved in the preparation of MNIPs; as such, there were no specific recognition holes or imprinting sites. The adsorption of CFX by MNIPs was mainly caused by non-specific adsorption of van der Waals force and other forces.\nPolymers 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 14\nconformed to the pseudo-second-order model, and the adsorption process was controlled by chemisorption.\nTable 1.

Static Adsorption The adsorption isotherms (at 25 \u00b0C) are shown in Figure 9a. At the same concentration, the adsorption capacity of MMIPs was higher than that of MNIPs, and the maximum adsorption capacity of MMIPs was 111.38 mg/g, which indicated that MMIPs had specific adsorption sites for CFX compared with MNIPs. To study the specific binding properties between MMIPs and CFX, Scatchard analysis was used to analyze the binding data. The results of the Scatchard analysis are shown in Table 2, and the Scatchard equation is as follows:\nQe Ce = Qm Kd \u2212 Qe Kd\n(5)\nwhere Qe (mg/g) is the adsorption capacity of the MMIPs at equilibrium; Qm (mg/g) is the maximum adsorption capacity; Ce (mg/L) is the concentration of the supernatant at equilibrium; and Kd (mg/L) is the equilibrium dissociation constant. As shown in Figure 9b, there were two distinct linear sections, indicating that two types of binding sites with different binding properties existed on the surface of the MMIPs. This is because a variety of complexes with different stabilities can be formed between CFX and APTES, and different types of complexes form binding sites with different adsorption properties during polymerization. Kd1 and Qmax1 for the linear section on the left were calculated to be 32.542 mg/L and 91.6043 mg/g, respectively, and those for the linear section on the right were calculated to be 96.618 mg/L and 163.217 mg/g, respectively. Because Kd1 < Kd2, the equation on the left corresponds to the high-affinity binding sites of MMIPs, while the equation on the right corresponds to the low-affinity binding sites of MMIPs. In contrast, the Scatchard fitted curve of the MNIPs (Figure 9c) shows only one straight line, which indicates that there was only one non-specific recognition site in the MNIPs. The binding data were analyzed using the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models to assess the maximum adsorption capacities of MMIPs and MNIPs. The Langmuir\nFigure 8.

The fitted data are shown in Table 1; the pseudo-second-order model (Figure 8c) was better than the pseudo-first-order model (Figure 8b).

The adsorption performance of MMIPs was evaluated through adsorption kinetics, adsorption isotherm, and reusability. The results showed that MMIPs could reach the adsorption equilibrium within 180 min, with a good imprinting effect and selectivity (imprinting factor 3.5), high adsorption capacity (111.38 mg/g), and excellent reuse performance (after five cycles of utilization, the adsorption capacity of cefixime could still be maintained at 90.3%). The synthesized molecularly imprinted polymer can be used as a new adsorption material, with high selectivity and high adsorption capacity for cefixime.\nAuthor Contributions: L.Z.: Investigation, Material preparation, Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing\u2014original draft; H.M.: Validation, Conceptualization, Writing\u2014review and editing; C.W.: Investigation, Data curation, Formal analysis; X.L.: Investigation, Data curation, Formal analysis; S.J.: Validation, Supervision, Conceptualization, Software; W.F.: Validation, Supervision, Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Writing\u2014review and editing; Y.Z.: Investigation, Conceptualization, Supervision.
