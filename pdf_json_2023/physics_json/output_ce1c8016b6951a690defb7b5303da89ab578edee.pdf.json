    "abstractText": "The present study investigates the relationship between the local structure, photocatalytic ability, and cathode performances in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) using Ni-substituted goethite nanoparticles (NixFe1\u2212xOOH NPs) with a range of \u2018x\u2019 values from 0 to 0.5. The structural characterization was performed applying various techniques, including X-ray diffractometry (XRD); thermogravimetry differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA); Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR); X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES/EXAFS), both measured at room temperature (RT); 57Fe M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy recorded at RT and low temperatures (LT) from 20 K to 300 K; Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller surface area measurement (BET), and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). In addition, the electrical properties of NixFe1\u2212xOOH NPs were evaluated by solid-state impedance spectroscopy (SS-IS). XRD showed the presence of goethite as the only crystalline phase in prepared samples with x \u2264 0.20, and goethite and \u03b1-Ni(OH)2 in the samples with x > 0.20. The sample with x = 0.10 (Ni10) showed the highest photo-Fenton ability with a first-order rate constant value (k) of 15.8 \u00d7 10\u22123 min\u22121. The 57Fe M\u00f6ssbauer spectrum of Ni0, measured at RT, displayed a sextet corresponding to goethite, with an isomer shift (\u03b4) of 0.36 mm s\u22121 and a hyperfine magnetic distribution (Bhf) of 32.95 T. Moreover, the DC conductivity decreased from 5.52 \u00d7 10\u221210 to 5.30 \u00d7 10\u221212 (\u03a9 cm)\u20131 with \u2018x\u2019 increasing from 0.10 to 0.50. Ni20 showed the highest initial discharge capacity of 223 mAh g\u22121, attributed to its largest specific surface area of 174.0 m2 g\u22121. In conclusion, NixFe1\u2212xOOH NPs can be effectively utilized as visible-light-activated catalysts and active cathode materials in secondary batteries.",

            "text": "Metal oxide nanoparticles (MO NPs) exhibit a large surface area and a pronounced quantum size effect due to superparamagnetism and the quantum tunnelling phenomenon, distinguishing them from bulk MO materials. Among the wide array of MO NPs, iron oxide NPs have emerged as a novel functional material class that has gained considerable attention across various domains. These include biomedical applications, wherein they demonstrate antimicrobial and anticancer activities [1], as well as catalysts [2], photocatalysts [3,4], and agents for environmental purification [5]. In particular, goethite (\u03b1-FeOOH) NPs represent the most readily available form of iron oxyhydroxide in nature. Their crystal structure comprises interconnected FeO3(OH)3\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 14300. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms241814300 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 14300 2 of 27\noctahedra with shared edge and vertex linkages. The versatile applications of \u03b1-FeOOH NPs encompass traditional roles as pigments, catalysts, photocatalysts [6], adsorbents, gas sensors, photoelectrodes [7], and battery electrodes [8,9]. Notably, the utilization of \u03b1-FeOOH NPs for wastewater purification and as secondary battery electrodes holds immense significance in realizing future sustainable development goals. This is primarily due to their ability, non-toxic nature, stability, electrical conductivity, and photocatalytic activity under visible-light exposure [10]. As for the UV- and visible-light-activated photocatalytic ability of \u03b1-FeOOH NPs, a first-order rate constant (k) of 7.4 \u00d7 10\u22124 min\u22121 was recorded for 15 mg of hematite (\u03b1-Fe2O3) NPs formed by the combustion method, in a reaction with 50 mL of an aqueous solution containing 10 mg of Rhodamine B (RhB) under UV light irradiation [3]. In this reaction, 95% of the RhB decomposed after 180 min [3]. In addition, the photocatalytic reaction between RhB\u2013H2O2 aqueous solutions and 10 mg of powdered, 4 mol% Cu-doped goethites under exposure to visible light resulted in a 60% degradation of RhB in 1 h, which could be attributed to the combined effect of nanoneedle morphology and Cu doping [11]. In relation to the developments of visible-light-activated photocatalysts and secondary battery electrodes of iron oxide NPs, we confirmed the methylene blue (MB) degradation effect of a mixture of Fe NPs and \u03b3-Fe2O3 NPs [12]. In this study, a 10-day MBaq degradation test using a 1:3 molar ratio of Fe NPs to \u03b3-Fe2O3 NPs mixed powder showed a significant decrease in MB concentration from 20.0 to 0.85 \u00b5M with a maximum k value of 2.84 day\u22121, indicating that iron oxide NPs effectively degrade organic compounds [13]. This result proves that the nano size of Fe and \u03b3-Fe2O3 showed larger reactivity because of their high surface area. Another result of methylene blue decomposition was reported on Snincorporated FeOOH NPs, showing a smaller band gap energy and higher decomposition performance compared to pure FeOOH. It is assumed that the band gap energy of \u03b1-FeOOH NPs decreased due to the introduction of SnIV [14]. On the other hand, as for the application of \u03b1-FeOOH as an electrode for a secondary battery, an excellent cycling performance with a reversible specific capacity of 870 mAh g\u22121 under the current rate of 100 mA g\u22121 of LIB was reported. The anode contained \u03b1-FeOOH corner-truncated prisms (CTPs) with a length of approximately 1 \u00b5m and a width of approximately 200 nm obtained by hydrothermal treatment [9]. An intriguing and notable characteristic of \u03b1-FeOOH NPs is their inherent capability to incorporate diverse metal cations into their crystal structure. This opens the field to the possibility of modifying various crystal properties, including morphology, size, crystallinity, and colour, by replacing Fe3+ ions within the structure. In particular, the doping of \u03b1-FeOOH NPs with a range of metal cations, such as Al3+, In3+, Cu2+, Cr2+, Mn2+, and Zn2+, was extensively investigated to enhance further the aforementioned physical properties [11,12]. These studies have explored the potential for improving and refining the characteristics of \u03b1-FeOOH NPs by introducing and incorporating these selected metal cations into their structure. In addition, Cu2+-for-Fe3+ substitution in goethite caused a gradual elongation and narrowing of nanorods with the formation of nanoneedles, which led to a slight decrease in direct and indirect optical band gaps compared with the pure phases [11]. The introduction of nickel (Ni) as a dopant in\u03b1-FeOOH NPs is anticipated to impact their crystalline structure and oxidation state. Ni can substitute for Fe ions within the crystal lattice of \u03b1-FeOOH NPs [12]. This incorporation of Ni is likely to result in slight modifications of the crystalline structure, which predominantly consists of interconnected FeO6 octahedra with shared edges and vertices [11,12]. Upon doping with Ni, the dopant ions can occupy available sites within the lattice [11,12]. The extent of the structural changes depends on many factors such as the concentration of the dopant and its compatibility with the lattice structure of \u03b1-FeOOH [15]. The oxidation state of Ni within the doped \u03b1-FeOOH NPs primarily depends on the specific synthesis conditions and the prevailing redox environment [15]. Typically, Ni is commonly found in a +2-valence state. However, it is important to note that the\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 14300 3 of 27\nlocal chemical environment and interactions with neighbouring atoms within the lattice structure can influence the oxidation state of the dopant ions. Herein, we report the relationship between the structure, photocatalytic ability, and active cathode property of a secondary battery of Ni-substituted \u03b1-FeOOH NPs prepared by hydrothermal synthesis. For this purpose, structural characterization was performed by X-ray diffractometry (XRD), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES/EXAFS), and 57Fe-M\u00f6ssbaur spectroscopy. Moreover, for the properties of photocatalytic ability, electrochemical performance, and active cathode evaluation, Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) surface area analysis, diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, impedance spectroscopy (IS), and active cathode performance of LIBs and SIBs were carried out."

The XRD peaks of goethite (ICDD card No. 00-029-0713) with the space group (Pbnm) were observed in all XRD patterns with increasing Ni content. Moreover, a new peak appeared at 2\u03b8 = 11.56\u25e6 corresponding to the (0 0 3) plane of \u03b1-Ni(OH)2 crystalline phase (ICDD card No.01-076-6904) with the space group (R3m: H), and the intensity of this peak increased with the increasing x content from 0.30 to 0.50, as shown in the yellow rectangle in Figure 1. The percentage of the \u03b1-Ni(OH)2 crystalline phase increased from 7.63% to 9.35% while \u2018x\u2019 increased from 0.30 to 0.50, as shown in Table 1. Additionally, the elevation of background intensity observed in the XRD patterns depicted in Figure 1, as the Ni content increased from 0.30 to 0.50, suggests the appearance of an amorphous Ni hydroxide phase. The diffraction lines of \u03b1-FeOOH were slightly shifted towards lower 2\u03b8 values with the increasing Ni content, implying a minor expansion in the unit cell due to Ni/Fe substitution. The unit cell parameters of goethite in the Ni0, Ni5, Ni10, Ni15, Ni20, Ni30, Ni40, and Ni50 samples obtained by Rietveld refinement of the XRD patterns are listed in Table 1. The slight variation in ionic radius between Fe3+ (0.645 \u00c5) and Ni2+ (0.69 \u00c5) [16] ions caused a small expansion of the unit cell of \u03b1-FeOOH. In line with the previous studies [17,18], it was observed that the expansion along the b-axis direction was most remarkable. The non-uniform expansion is likely to be attributed to different distortions in the octahedral sites occupied by Ni2+ and Fe3+ ions, stemming from their disparate electron configurations (3d8 and 3d5, respectively). The incorporation of Ni into \u03b1-FeOOH can be attributed partially to its incongruent release from the initial Fe-Ni hydroxide (Ni-ferrihydrite) [19]. The calculated average size of \u03b1-NixFe1\u2212xOOH NPs by the Scherrer equation from the FWHM of the (110) diffraction line is summarized in Table 1. Int. J. Mol.

The weight loss at temperatures up to approximately 140 \u25e6C corresponds to the release of H2O molecules adsorbed on the surface of NixFe1\u2212xOOH NPs crystals or trapped within the interstitial spaces between them [19,20]. This low-temperature weight loss increased in the NixFe1\u2212xOOH NPs samples with the increased Ni content, which can be explained by more adsorbed water in the NiFeOOH NPs samples with a large surface area [20]. Furthermore, different molar fractions of incorporated Ni2+ ions and different crystal facets in Ni-doped NixFe1\u2212xOOH NPs crystals can also affect the amount of adsorbed water in NixFe1\u2212xOOH NPs samples. The weight loss at temperatures between approximately 150 and 290 \u25e6C can be attributed to the dehydroxylation of the surface hydroxyl groups [18\u201320]. This weight loss also increases in the NixFe1\u2212xOOH NPs with a higher Ni content due to the larger surface area. The total weight loss percentage for NixFe1\u2212xOOH NPs in the temperature range from RT to 1000 \u25e6C increased when the Ni content increased, from 14.24% in Ni0 to 26.63% in Ni50, as shown in Figure 2a.

The DTA curve of NixFe1\u2212xOOH NPs showed a single endothermic peak in the temperature range from 230\u2013300 \u25e6C due to the phase transformation from \u03b1-FeOOH to \u03b1-Fe2O3 [18,19]. As the amount of Ni increased from 0 to 20 mol%, the endothermic peak became smaller and somewhat shifted to higher temperatures from 251 \u25e6C in Ni0 to 262 \u25e6C in Ni20, while in Ni30, it shifted in the opposite direction and was observed at 241 \u25e6C. The intensity of the endothermic peak of Ni30 was highly diminished compared to the rest of the samples. It seems to be related to the appearance of a second minor \u03b1-Ni(OH)2 crystalline phase in Ni30, see Figure 1. As the Ni increases, a new endothermic peak appears in Ni40 and Ni50 at lower temperatures 150\u2013200 \u25e6C, caused by the lower degree of crystallinity or the increased amorphous phase [19], in addition to the resolved second one at 250\u2013260 \u25e6C.

In this study, Ni substituted with Fe caused a shift toward lower wave numbers with the increasing Ni content from Ni0 to Ni30, while in Ni40 and Ni50, an increase in particle size caused a change to a higher wave number.

Figure 4a displays the normalized Fe K-edge XAFS spectra of \u03b1-NixFe1\u2212xOOH NPs. The Fe K absorption edge was observed at a normalized intensity = 0.5 for Fe-foil, Fe3O4, and Fe2O3 being 7117.26 \u00b1 0.02, 7120.67 \u00b1 0.02, and 7121.79 \u00b1 0.02 eV, respectively.

The increasing oxidation state of Fe results in a shift of the absorption edge to higher energy [27]; according to the above, the values of the absorption edge of \u03b1NixFe1\u2212xOOH NPs are higher than the values of Fe2O3 (Fe3+), this implies that none of the \u03b1-NixFe1\u2212xOOH NPs samples contained Fe2+, and they contained only Fe3+. The pre-edge peak was found at 7113 eV for \u03b1-NixFe1\u2212xOOH NPs and at 7114 eV for both Fe-foil and Fe2O3, being designated as the absorption edge. The pre-edge features in the XANES spectrum reveal electronic states and symmetry of the unoccupied orbitals in the absorbing atom [27,28]. Analyzing the intensity, energy position, and shape of pre-edge peaks helps understand the electronic structure, oxidation state, and local environment of Fe atoms in the material [29]. The intensity of the pre-edge peak is lower when the octahedral site has high symmetry. \u03b1-FeOOH with the octahedral structure of FeO6 shows an increase in the pre-edge peak intensity and, therefore, a decrease in symmetry with the increasing Ni content.\nInt.

The pre-edge peak of Ni foils, NiO, and NixFe1\u2212xOOH NPs was shown at 8321.40, 8319.68, and 8319.48 eV, respectively [30]. The height of the pre-edge peak intensity of NiO and NixFe1\u2212xOOH NPs has approximately the same value, and the change in the pre-edge is minimal. Therefore, we cannot find any significant difference in the oxidation state of Ni and the symmetry of the structure [31]. In contrast, the Ni-K normalized absorption peak of NixFe1\u2212xOOH NPs and reference materials are shown in the inserted figure in Figure 4c. The absorption edge of Ni-foil, NixFe1\u2212xOOH NPs, and NiO is at 8327.40, (8329.21\u20138329.48), and 8328.76 eV, respectively. According to the absorption edge\u2019s higher value compared to NiO, the oxidation state of Ni in all NixFe1\u2212xOOH NPs samples is higher than +2. Both Ni15 and Ni20 are samples containing less Ni3+, while Ni10 has the highest level of Ni3+. Figure 4b shows the Fourier transform of Fe-K-edge EXAFS (FT-EXAFS) for\u03b1-NixFe1\u2212xOOH NPs. The FT-EXAFS of \u03b1-NixFe1\u2212xOOH NPs, in the first coordination, was observed at 1.57 \u00c5, and the peak intensity decreased with the increasing \u2018x\u2019 from 0.10 to 0.50, and this\nInt.

Moreover, the second peak of Fe-foil, Fe3O4, and Fe2O3 was shown at 2.21 \u00c5, 2.91 \u00c5, and 2.68 \u00c5, respectively. The second peak of NixFe1\u2212xOOH NPs was also shown between the Fe2O3 and Fe3O4. Furthermore, this peak was shifted to a higher Fe-Fe distance, and the peak intensity decreased by reducing the Fe content from 1 to 0.50. All observed peaks in this range (2.21\u20132.91) \u00c5 are attributed to Fe-Fe (or Fe-Ni) [32,33]. Figure 4d shows the Ni-K FT-EXAFS of NixFe1\u2212xOOH NPs, and it was clear that the two peaks at 1.63 \u00c5 and 2.77 \u00c5 can be attributed to Ni-O and Ni-Me (Me = Ni or Fe), respectively [33\u201335]. The first peak was moved to a higher distance between Ni and O 1.75 \u00c5, but the second peak shifted to a lower Ni-Me distance of 2.62 \u00c5 for NixFe1\u2212xOOH NPs [35]. The intensity of the first peak decreased, and the peak position was moved to a higher radius with the increasing Ni content. These results obtained from Ni-K and Fe-K FT-EXAFS and XANES of the NixFe1\u2212xOOH NPs agree with the XRD results."

            "text": "Figure 5 shows the 57Fe-M\u00f6ssbauer spectra of \u03b1-NixFe1\u2212xOOH NPs \u2018x\u2019 from 0.00 to 0.50 measured at RT in the velocity range from 12 mm s\u22121 to \u221212 mm s\u22121 and from 3 mm s\u22121 to \u22123 mm s\u22121. The M\u00f6ssbauer parameters in these two velocity ranges are listed in Tables 2 and 3. Figure 5a shows the 57Fe-M\u00f6ssbauer spectra of Ni0, Ni10, Ni20, Ni30, Ni40, and Ni50 measured at RT in the wide velocity range from 12 mm s\u22121 to \u221212 mm s\u22121. The M\u00f6ssbauer spectra exhibit a sextet with M\u00f6ssbauer parameters characteristic of \u03b1-NixFe1\u2212xOOH NPs \u2018x\u2019 from 0.00 to 0.30 as the predominant component, while the sextet disappeared after increasing the Ni content to 0.30. The \u03b1-FeOOH NPs and \u03b1-NixFe1\u2212xOOH NPs spectra were analyzed by incorporating the hyperfine magnetic distribution (Bhf); their average values are presented in Table 2. The slight changes in isomer shift, except for the Ni0 sample, indicate that the site is distorted goethite, as shown in Table 2. Moreover, the presence of a quadrupole doublet, which increases as the Ni content increases, can be ascribed to the presence of Fe3+ ions in a low-crystalline or amorphous phase. This phase could be attributed to compounds such as Ni-Fe hydroxide, low crystalline Ni-ferrite, or Ni-goethite. The higher proportion of the low-crystalline or amorphous phase aligns with the increased background observed in the XRD patterns, as depicted in Figure 1. Moreover, the line width value increased from 0.196 to 0.53 mm s\u22121, possibly confirming the result obtained from XRD, wherein the amorphous phases increased with the increasing Ni content. In addition, the particle size of the goethite drops to a nanoscale, and the superparamagnetic component increases as a function of the increasing Ni content [11,14,15]. The presence of the doublet suggests nanosized goethite particles in Ni40 and Ni50. To analyze the doublet component of the M\u00f6ssbauer spectra of Ni20, Ni30, Ni40, and Ni50 measured at RT in the wide velocity range for more detail, a narrower velocity range from 3 mm s\u22121 to \u22123 mm s\u22121 was applied, and the spectra are presented in Figure 5b. One doublet shown in the Ni20, Ni30, Ni40, and Ni50 spectra in the wide velocity range from 12 mm s\u22121 to \u221212 mm s\u22121 was analyzed as a doublet component. The two doublets were considered to be derived from the superparamagnetic and amorphous (or ferrihydrite) components [15]. On the other hand, the M\u00f6ssbauer spectra of Ni0, Ni5, Ni10, and Ni20 were measured in the range of velocity from 12 mm s\u22121 to \u221212 mm s\u22121 at 86 K, as shown in Figure 6a. Goethite was present in all spectra, and a doublet derived from amorphous (or ferrihydrite) is also present in Ni10 and Ni20.

Therefore, it is considered that amorphous ageing is progressing, and ferrihydrite is being formed [17,19]. This is consistent with the fact that Ni50 has a specific surface area lower than Ni20, as was shown by BET analysis [35]. In addition, sample Ni20 contains goethite and an amorphous phase, while sample Ni50 also contains crystalline \u03b1-Ni(OH)2, which is a possible reason for the lower surface area. The M\u00f6ssbauer parameter spectra of Ni10 and Ni20 were measured at low temperatures from 20 K to 300 K, as shown in Figure S1, and the M\u00f6ssbauer parameters of Ni10 and Ni20 are summarized in Tables S3 and S4.\n(a) (b)\nFigure 6. 57Fe-M\u00f6ssbauer spectra of \u03b1-NixFe1\u2212xOOH NPs nanoparticles measured at 86 K in the velocity range of (a) \u00b112 mm s\u22121, with \u2018x\u2019 from 0.00 to 0.20 and (b) \u00b13 mm s\u22121 with \u2018x\u2019 of 0.20 and 0.50.\nAs shown in Table 2, the M\u00f6ssbauer parameters measured at room temperature indicated a sextet and a doublet related to goethite and the superparamagnetic phase.

These results are in good agreement with the XRD and XAFS measurements, as shown in Figures 1 and 4. From Table S2, the quadrupole splitting of the doublet derived from amorphous or ferrihydrite increased from 0.70 mm s\u22121 for Ni20 to 0.89 mm s\u22121 for Ni50. Therefore, it is considered that amorphous ageing is progressing, and ferrihydrite is being\nformed [17,19]. This is consistent with the fact that Ni50 has a specific surface area lower\nthan Ni20, as was shown by BET analysis [35]. In addition, sample Ni20 contains goethite\nand an amorphous phase, while sample Ni50 also contains crystalline \u03b1-Ni(OH)2, which is a possible reason for the lower surface area. The M\u00f6ssbauer parameter spectra of Ni10 and Ni20 were measured at low temperatures from 20 K to 300 K, as shown in Figure S1, and the M\u00f6ssbauer parameters of Ni10 and Ni20 are summarized in Tables S3 and S4. As shown in Table 2, the M\u00f6ssbauer parameters measured at room temperature indicated a sextet and a doublet related to goethite and the superparamagnetic phase. Furthermore, the doublet shown at RT is divided into two doublets related to the superparamagnetic and amorphous phases. Additionally, with the decreasing temperat re from 300 K to 20 K, the doublets disappeared in both samples Ni10 and Ni20."

The number of gas molecules adsorbed was quantified and graphed against the relative pressure, resulting in an isotherm. Figure 9 displays the isotherms of \u03b1-NixFe1\u2212xOOH NPs. Many factors influence the shape of the curve of an isotherm, such as the existence and dimensions of the pores and adsorption energy. In 1985, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) published a classification system comprising six types of adsorption/desorption isotherms. Over the past three decades, two additional types have been introduced. The isotherm shape observed for Ni0 and Ni10 is classified as type II according to this classification. Type II indicates the absence of pores or the potential presence of macropores (pores with sizes exceeding 50 nm) [36]. The IV and V types exhibit a unique phenomenon known as hysteresis, wherein the adsorption and desorption processes do not align as typically [37]. Int. J. Mol.

The established relationship between P/P0 values in the range of 0.05 to 0.35 reveals significant insights. The surface area, determined by applying the BET method, is presented in Table 5. Based on these calculations, the surface area of Ni0 was found to be 45.1 m2g\u22121. With an increase in the Ni content from Ni0 to Ni20, the surface area progressively rises, reaching the highest value of 174.0 m2g\u22121 for Ni20. However, as the Ni content is further increased, the surface area decreases, reaching 96.3 m2g\u22121 for Ni40. Based on this result, it can be expected that the electrochemical properties of Ni20 will be the best due to possessing the largest surface area compared to all prepared samples.\nFigure 9.

The hysteresis pattern observed can offer insights into the shape and structure of the pore. However, due to the diverse nature of hysteresis patterns, establishing a direct relationship between them and pore shape and structure is challenging. On the other hand, the adsorption isotherms for Ni20, Ni30, Ni40, and Ni50 fall into the H4-type hysteresis classification. Type H4 is indicative of the presence of slit-type pores. This type of hysteresis pattern can sometimes be observed when micropores (pores with sizes of 2 nm or less) are present, as seen in type I isotherms [39]. Based on the isotherm\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 14300 13 of 27\nshape depicted in Figure 9, it can be inferred that Ni0 to Ni10 possess macropores, while Ni20 to Ni50 exhibit micropores. The presence of micropores can also be deduced from the rapid increase in adsorption at low relative pressures and the characteristics of the hysteresis loop. The BET method can extract information regarding the adsorption process, specifically from monolayer adsorption to multilayer adsorption. The sample\u2019s surface area can be determined by accurately calculating the degree of monolayer adsorption. This can be achieved by multiplying the quantity of single-molecule adsorption by the cross-sectional area occupied by a single gas molecule, as follows [37].\nP V(P0 \u2212 P) = 1 VmC + ( C \u2212 1 VmC )( P P0 ) (1)\nP, P0, Vm, and C are parameters related to adsorption equilibrium pressure, saturation vapour pressure line, monolayer adsorption volume (e.g., adsorption volume when the gas molecules form a monolayer on a solid surface), and adsorption heat, respectively. The established relationship between P/P0 values in the range of 0.05 to 0.35 reveals significant insights. The surface area, determined by applying the BET method, is presented in Table 5.

Figure 10 displays the plot of (h\u03bd\u03b1)2 versus (h\u03bd) obtained from diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) measurements of NixFe1\u2212xOOH NPs, enabling the estimation of the Eg values. The Eg value for pure goethite (Ni0) was determined to be 2.71 \u00b1 0.01 eV. Table 5 shows that the Eg values for all Ni-doped samples were smaller than that of Ni0. Notably, the smallest Eg value of 2.06 \u00b1 0.01 eV was observed for the Ni30 sample, determined as the x-axis intercept of the fitted straight lines depicted in Figure 10b. The Eg values of Ni40 and N50 were increased to 2.13 \u00b1 0.01 eV and 2.15 \u00b1 0.01 eV, respectively. The existence of Ni(OH)2 precipitated in Ni100x with x larger than 30 was the reason for the increase in band gap energy because NiO6 in Ni(OH)2 has a similar environment to NiO [36]. This comparison highlights the greater effectiveness of Ni addition in reducing the band gap. Photogenerated carriers are produced when a photocatalyst absorbs photons with energy larger than its Eg. Consequently, in this study, the NixFe1\u2212xOOH NPs exhibit high excitability when exposed to a metal\u2013halide lamp emitting light with wavelengths ranging from 250 to 750 nm. This excitation greatly enhances the photocatalytic performance [47].

It is noted that no decrease in the MBaq appeared for the degradation test using Ni0, and a slight degradation showed for Ni30.

The corresponding plots depicting the variation of (c/c0) over time (t) under visible light conditions are presented in Figure 11b. The most rapid decrease in (c/c0) during the photo-Fenton reaction is observed with Ni10. This can be attributed to the oxidation of Ni that occurred in this sample. This sample has the highest Ni-K XAFS absorption energy, which leads to it being the Ni10 containing the most Ni(III), see Figure 4c. Figure 11c illustrates the relationship between ln(ct/c0) and t for \u03b1-NixFe1\u2212xOOH NPs. The values of k, representing the rate constant for MBaq decomposition, were determined and are presented in Table 5. For Ni0, the value of k is 6.4 \u00b1 0.1 \u00d7 10\u22123 min\u22121, while the maximum value of k, 15.8 \u00b1 0.6 \u00d7 10\u22123 min\u22121, is observed for Ni10. As Ni is added to goethite, the k values show an increasing trend from Ni5 to Ni10. However, for Ni15 and the subsequent samples, the k values are smaller than that for Ni0. In the case of Ni15 and the later samples, a decrease in goethite content is observed, accompanied by the generation of a significant amount of low-crystalline substances. This change in composition is believed to be the underlying cause of the lower k values observed. Notably, Ni10 exhibits the highest k value among the samples. This can be attributed to the findings from the DRS, XAFS, and FeMS data, which suggest a reduction in the band gap and non-oxidation processes occurring in the Ni10 sample."

            "text": "The experimental data obtained through solid-state impedance spectroscopy (SSIS) are presented in a complex impedance plane, known as the Nyquist diagram, see Figures 12a\u2013c and S2. The analysis of these plots involves employing electrical equivalent circuit (EEC) modelling, which utilizes a complex nonlinear least-square (CNLLSQ) fitting procedure. It is apparent that the impedance spectra observed in all examined samples exhibit a distinct semicircle, representing the bulk electrical process within the investigated \u03b1- NixFe1\u2212xOOH NPs. This behaviour can be effectively described by an equivalent R-CPE circuit. The parameters for each circuit element (R, A, and \u03b1) were directly derived from the measured impedance data using the CNLLSQ method. In the present study, we took a step further and examined the conductivity spectra of all the samples. The conductivity spectra of samples with Ni10 and Ni20 at different temperatures are shown in Figure 13a,b, respectively. Although the conductivity isotherms have a similar shape, overall spectral features can be observed as follows. First, there exists a frequency-independent conductivity plateau at low frequencies. This particular feature is associated with the long-range transportation of charge carriers and represents the overall resistance observed in the impedance spectra or DC conductivity. In addition, frequencydependent conductivity, commonly referred to as conductivity dispersion, manifests itself with increasing frequency in the form of a power-law. This behaviour arises from localized movements of charge carriers occurring over short distances. We used values of the fitting parameter R obtained from modelling along with sample geometry to determine the total DC conductivity, as shown in Table 6.

Moreover, at the same time, with Ni doping and a decrease in Fe content, the charge carrier concentration decreases.

The discharge capacity decreased with the increase in Ni content to 250 mAh g\u22121 for Ni30. Moreover, the capacity retention of all samples suddenly dropped after 10 cycles. The capacity retention of Ni0, Ni20, and Ni30 was less than 1%, while Ni10 was 7.4%. On the other hand, after a tenfold increase in the current rate to 50 mA g\u22121, the initial discharge capacity of Ni0, Ni10, and Ni20 was 333, 350, and 494 mAh g\u22121, respectively, and the discharge capacity increased with the Ni content. However, capacity retention decreased when the Ni content was increased. We can conclude that after increasing the current rate from 5 to 50 mA g\u22121, the initial capacity of all samples decreased, while the capacity retention was enhanced, as shown in Table 6 and Figure 15a.\nFigure 14. (a) Conductivity isotherms and (b) DC conductivity obtained at @110 \u25e6C with activation energy for DC conductivity, EDC, for all studied samples.\nHowever, it is important to note that our understanding of the electronic structure of iron oxides and oxyhydroxides, including goethite, remains incomplete. In our study on NixFe1\u2212xOOH NPs, the obtained values for the activation energy (0.75\u20130.85 eV), se Table 5, are almost three times lower in comparison to the goethites studied by Guskos et al. [48]. Our findings align more closely with the activation energy values ported for magnetite and hematite. Similar values re observed i the literature for various materials with disordere or partially disorde ed structures and dominant electron transport [49\u201352]. The goethite struc ure can be described as parallel double chains of edge-sharing octahedra. These chains consist of FeIII bonded to th ee oxide ions and three hyd xides extending along the [001] direction and are linked to the neighb uring double chains by corner sharing. Guskos et al. [48] conducte an electrical study goe hite and pr posed that charge transport occurs through thermally activat d thre -dimensional hopping of el ctrons via oxygen vacancies, based on DC electrical measurement conducted over a wide temper ture range.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 14300 20 of 27\nFurthermore, Vitaly et al. [53] showed that RT charge transport in goethite is primarily governed by the thermally activated hopping of small polarons, with the associated mobility being higher compared to other iron oxyhydroxide (FeOOH) polymorphs. Small polarons are formed when electrons self-trap onto an iron centre, resulting in conduction through phonon-mediated hops between centres [54]. Different inequivalent paths for electron hopping characterized by different Fe-Fe bond distances and species bridging two neighbouring Fe atoms are identified [53]. The pathway involving migration along the double chain ([001] direction) through shared octahedral edges, with electron transport mediated by O and OH species, is characterized by Fe atoms with parallel spins and with the shortest Fe2+-Fe3+ distance of approximately 3 \u00c5.

            "text": "The electrical properties were studied by solid-state impedance spectroscopy. Powder samples were pressed into cylindrical pellets 10 mm in diameter and with a thickness of approximately 0.5 mm under a uniform load of 2 tons using a hydraulic press. Gold electrodes 6 mm in diameter were sputtered onto both sides of the sample pellets using Sputter coater SC7620, Quorum Technologies for the electrical contact. The complex impedance was measured using an impedance analyzer (Novocontrol Alpha-AN Dielectric Spectrometer, Novocontrol Technologies GmbH & Co. KG, Montabaur, Germany) over a wide frequency range from 0.01 Hz to 1 MHz at temperatures between 30 \u25e6C and 170 \u25e6C (step 20 \u25e6C). The temperature was controlled to an accuracy of \u00b10.2 K. The experimental data were analyzed by the electrical equivalent circuit (EEC) modelling employing the complex nonlinear least-square (CNLLSQ) fitting procedure. Depending on the EEC used and the obtained fitting parameters, various process(es) can be identified and separated. Typically, a single impedance semicircle can be represented by an EEC that combines a resistor and a capacitor connected in parallel. Ideally, this semicircle should pass through the origin of a complex plot and yield a low-frequency intercept on the real axis, corresponding to the resistance, R, of the observed process. However, in cases where the experimentally observed semicircle appears depressed, an alternative component known as the constant-phase element (CPE) is used instead of the standard capacitor in the equivalent circuits. The CPE is an empirical impedance function of the type: Z*CPE = 1/A(i\u03c9)\u03b1 where A and \u03b1 are the constants. For the samples in this study, the complex impedance spectrum is described by an equivalent R-CPE circuit. The parameters for each circuit element (R, A, and \u03b1) were determined directly from the measured impedance data using the CNLLSQ method. The DC conductivity values are calculated based on the modelling process, considering both the parameters obtained and the sample geometry."

            "text": "To prepare the cathode, first, 250 mg of \u03b1-NixFe1\u2212xOOH NPs and 95 mg of acetylene black (AB, Strem chemicals 06-0025, Newburyport, MA, USA) were mixed by a ball mill (Planet M2-3F, Nagao System, Kanagawa, Japan) at 800 rpm for 15 min. Then, 5 mg of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, Wako, Japan, 165-13412) was added to the 95 mg ball-milled mixture powder and mixed in the mortar until the powder became semi-solid and then pressed in a pellet with a diameter of 1 cm and weight of 30 mg. For the sodium-ion battery, metallic Na (Kishida, Osaka, Japan, 750-70852) (90 mg) and an electrolyte of 1 M NaClO4/propylene carbonate solution (Tomiyama LIPASTE-P/S1, Tokyo, Japan) were\nInt. J.

The 2032-type coin battery was assembled in a glove box under an oxygen concentration less than 0.99 ppm. TOSCAT-3100SK (TOYO-SYSTEM, Fukushima, Japan) measured the charge\u2013discharge capacity performance at 30 cycles under the voltage range of 0.8\u20134.0 V, a current rate of 5 and 50 mA g\u22121, and a lower limit current of 0.1 mA.

            "text": "In this paper, we studied the relationship between local structure, photo-Fenton catalytic ability, and electrochemical properties in LIBs and SIBs of Ni-doped goethite with the composition of \u03b1-NixFe1\u2212xOOH NPs (x = 0, 0.05, 0.10,0.15, 0.20, 0.30, 0.40, and 0.50, abbreviated as Ni100*x). The XRD patterns of \u03b1-NixFe1\u2212xOOH showed the \u03b1-FeOOH crystalline phases in all prepared samples. Moreover, a new crystalline phase is related to Ni(OH)2, for Ni contents from 0.30 to 0.50. The weight loss at low-temperature increased in the NixFe1\u2212xOOH NPs with the increased Ni content, which can be explained by more adsorbed water in the NiFeOOH NPs samples with a large surface area. The transmission peak observed at 3130 cm\u22121 corresponds to the O-H stretching vibration of the hydroxyl group. The strong two transmission peaks were observed at 797 cm\u22121 and 895 cm\u22121, related to Fe-O-H bending vibrations out of the plane and in the plane, respectively. The absorption edge energy of \u03b1-NixFe1\u2212xOOH NPs is higher than the values of Fe2O3 (Fe3+); this implies that none of the \u03b1-NixFe1\u2212xOOH NPs samples contained Fe2+, and they contained only Fe3+. Moreover, the Ni-K absorption edge energy of NixFe1\u2212xOOH NPs is higher than that expected for pure Ni2+. Samples Ni15 and Ni20 contain less Ni3+, while Ni10 has the highest Ni3+ content. The 57Fe M\u00f6ssbauer spectrum of Ni0, measured at RT, displayed a sextet corresponding to goethite with an isomer shift (\u03b4) of 0.36 mm s\u22121 and a hyperfine magnetic distribution (Bhf) of 32.4 T. The absorption area of the superparamagnetic component increased from 4.8% to 82.9%, with an increase in Ni content up to an \u2018x\u2019 value of 0.2. The surface area of Ni100*x changed from 45.1 to 59.9, 73.9, 135, 174, 145, and 178 m2 g\u22121 with \u2018x\u2019 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.30, 0.40, and 0.50, respectively. In addition, the optical band of NixFe1\u2212xOOH NPs decreased from 2.71 eV to 2.15 eV with the increasing Ni content from 0 to 0.50. The largest first-order rate constant (k) of 14.6 \u00d7 10\u22123 min\u22121 was measured for Ni10. The DC conductivity decreased from 5.52 \u00d7 10\u221210 to 5.30 \u00d7 10\u221212 (\u2126 cm)\u22121 with \u2018x\u2019 increasing from 0.10 to 0.50. The highest initial capacity was recorded at 494 mAh g\u22121 for Ni30 at the current rate of 5 mA g\u22121 as a cathode material in LIB. Meanwhile, in SIB, the largest initial capacity was found as 233 mAh g\u22121 for Ni20 at a current rate of 5 mA g\u22121. In conclusion, \u03b1-NixFe1\u2212xOOH NPs can be effectively utilized as visible-light-activated catalysts and active cathode materials in secondary batteries.\nSupplementary Materials: The supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi. com/article/10.3390/ijms241814300/s1.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, A.I. and S.K.
