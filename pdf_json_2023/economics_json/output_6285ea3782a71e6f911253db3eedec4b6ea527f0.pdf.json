    "abstractText": "The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a change in food demand. In Central Java, during the pandemic (2021), the proportion of expenditure on the grain food group was higher than in 2020; meanwhile, the proportion of the ready-to-eat food group decreased. This study aims to analyze the pattern of food consumption of carbohydrate sources, the influencing factors, and the elasticity of consumption in households in Central Java before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study uses data from the National Socio-Economic Survey (Susenas) for 12 districts/ cities in Central Java consisting of 9,812 in 2019 and 10,636 households samples in 2021. Data analysis used the Linear Approximation Almost Ideal Demand System (LA-AIDS) method. Results of the study show that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused changes in the household consumption pattern of carbohydrate-source food in Central Java. The proportion of expenditure on rice, wheat flour, shelled corn, cassava, and potatoes has increased. On the other hand, wet corn, instant noodles, and white rice decreased. The price of food sources of carbohydrates and the number of household members positively affect the consumption of food sources of carbohydrates. At the same time, income has a negative effect. There are differences in the effect of the location of the residence on the consumption of food sources of carbohydrates before and during the pandemic. The value of own-price elasticity and income elasticity shows that before the pandemic, rice was a staple good whose consumption was inelastic. Before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, wheat flour, wet-skinned corn, shelled corn, potatoes, white rice, and cassava in the pre-pandemic period was Giffen because the price elasticity was positive, and the income elasticity was negative. Meanwhile, rice during the pandemic, instant noodles before and during the pandemic, and cassava were Veblen goods because their price and income elasticity were positive. Cross elasticity shows that before the pandemic, most of the relationships between food sources of carbohydrates were substitutes, while during the pandemic, most of the relationships between food sources of carbohydrates were complementary.",

Food consumption will produce a healthy body if contain element of carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals in sufficient and balanced quantities [3].\nThe calorie demands of the human body are mainly supplied by three dietary macronutrients: carbohydrates, fat, and protein [4]. Carbohydrates are the main source of energy in the diet (55\u201375%) for most people. Contribution of carbohydrates to total dietary energy consumption: 63% in the world, 53% in developed countries, 67% in the developing world, and 72% in Sub-Saharan Africa [5]. Carbohydrates provide the body with glucose, converted to energy used to support bodily functions and physical activity [6].\nGrain products, tubers, roots, and some fruits are rich in complex carbohydrates. Polysaccharides are commonly referred to as complex carbohydrates. They are found in a wide variety of natural and processed foods. Starch is a polysaccharide abundant in cereals (wheat, maize, and rice), potatoes, and processed food based on cereal flour,\n * Corresponding author: Wiwit Rahayu, Graduate School of Universitas Sebelas Maret, Surakarta, Central Java, Indonesia; Agribusiness Department, Faculty of Agriculture, Universitas Sebelas Maret, Surakarta, Central Java, Indonesia, e-mail: wiwitrahayu@staff.uns.ac.id, tel: +62-813-2755-3471 Darsono Darsono, Sri Marwanti, Ernoiz Antriyandarti: Agribusiness Department, Faculty of Agriculture, Universitas Sebelas Maret, Surakarta, Central Java, Indonesia\nOpen Access. \u00a9 2023 the author(s), published by De Gruyter.

Rice is a staple cereal in social nutrition and the primary food grain for more than a third of the world\u2019s population [8]. Rice is a great source of carbs, with roughly 87% of the grain being carbohydrates. It contains 7\u20138% protein, which is more digestible, biologically valuable, and nutritious, as well as less crude fiber and fat (1\u20132%). Rice provides around 20% of the world\u2019s dietary energy, which is more than maize or wheat [9].\nConsumption of staple foods such as rice, maize, and cassava is very high in low- to middle-income countries [10\u201313]. Staple food as a source of carbohydrates has an important role in human life, especially in developing countries such as Indonesia [14]. Rice is the main staple food and the main food source of carbohydrates for most of Indonesia\u2019s population [15\u201321]. In addition to rice, other carbohydrate sources commonly consumed are corn, cassava, sweet potatoes, and wheat and their derivatives, such as bread and instant noodles [22]. In 2018, rice consumption by Indonesian people was 81.60 kg/capita, a decrease from 2017, which was 86.82 kg. This shows a change in the consumption pattern from rice to other carbohydrate-source foods [22].\nChanges in food preferences are dynamic in line with changes in education level, income, number of household members, and age. Price increases or decreases will impact preferences [22]. Changes in the economy, nutrition policies, and food processing methods can affect the macronutrient composition and diet quality at the population level [19\u201321]. Food price positively determines people\u2019s real income for food traders and negatively for buyers, which will affect the distribution of income and investment, thus contributing to poverty, which also influences household access to food [23].\nDisasters such as the COVID-19 pandemic can disrupt the food system [24]. The spread of the COVID-19 virus has had a major impact on people\u2019s lives, economically and socially, to food [25,26]. The COVID-19 pandemic is a health and humanitarian crisis threatening the food security and nutrition of millions worldwide. High unemployment, loss of income, and rising food costs make access to food difficult for many [27]. Restrictivemeasures on daily life that the government has implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic have an impact on behavior and eating patterns [28\u201332]. In Indonesia, the Large-Scale Social Restrictions (PSBB) policies in various regions directly or indirectly have an impact on food commodity prices at the farmer level as well as changes in food demand at the consumer level. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a decline in food demand. Low-income households reduce the demand for nutritious food and consumemore carbohydrate sources [33]. The dynamics of food expenditure based on the food\ngroup of the population of Central Java shows that during 2016\u20132020 the proportion of food expenditure on grains tended to decrease, while for the processed food and beverage group, it tended to increase [34]. However, in 2021, the proportion of expenditure on the grain food group is 5.35%, higher than in 2020, which is 5.20%. Meanwhile, for the ready-to-eat food group, the proportion decreased from 17.03 to 16.40% [33].\nSeveral studies have been conducted to determine the relationship between carbohydrate consumption with health and socio-economic factors. Research to evaluate carbohydrate consumption and their associations with the metabolic disease was conducted by refs. [35\u201339]. Trends in carbohydrate consumption have been researched by ref. [9] and concluded that from 1999 to 2016, US adults experience a significant decrease in energy intake from low-quality carbohydrates and significant increases in energy intake from high-quality carbohydrates, plant protein, and polyunsaturated fat, and ref. [40] found that parboiled long-grain white rice is the most commonly consumed carbohydrate by urbanized Nigerians. Price change in carbohydrate sources has been proven to be more influential on the food demand in food-insecure provinces in Indonesia [41], the demand for carbohydrate-sourced food differs between rural and urban households which are influenced by price, income, and number of household members [42]; patterns of carbohydrate consumption in the city of Bengkulu showed that total rice consumption expenditures greater than the bulbs and factors affecting are the economic factor [43]. The dietary habits in Poland, Austria, and the United Kingdom have changed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The resulting data revealed an increased frequency of the daily consumption of food products such as dairy, grains, fats, vegetables, and sweets [44]. A study on the impact of the pandemic on nutrients and food intake of children and adolescents in Germany found that no significant changes in either the selected nutrients or food groups were observed. However, children and adolescents recorded a significantly lower TEI during the pandemic [33]. The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted the intake of dietary energy, carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, and the dietary intake of the lowincome group was significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic [45]. During lockdown, there was an increase in carbohydrate intake [46].\nMany studies on carbohydrate consumption had been conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic but they were limited during the pandemic. Some studies suggest changes in food consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, most studies do not include objective control data before the pandemic and therefore are based on subjective estimations\nby the participants themselves. The difference between this study and previous studies is that in this study, carbohydrate consumption patterns and the influencing factors are evaluated based on data before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The amount and type of food sources of carbohydrates in this study were also different from those of the previous studies [14,41].\nThis research aims to analyze the consumption pattern of carbohydrate-source food in households in Central Java, the influencing factors, and the response of households in consuming carbohydrate-source foods to income and price food changes before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study is important for policymakers to find out the household's behavior in consuming carbohydratesources food, before and during the pandemic. The result of the research will provide instructions for implementing appropriate food consumption policies."

The pattern of consumption of food sources of carbohydrates is seen based on the proportion of expenditure on food sources of carbohydrates to total expenditure on food (Table 1).\nTable 1 shows the largest proportion of rice expenditure compared to other carbohydrate sources. This shows that rice is the main source of carbohydrates consumed by households in Central Java. These results align with research [15\u201318,22] in which the rice is the main source of carbohydrates and the main staple food for the Indonesian population. In addition to rice, carbohydrates widely consumed consecutively are instant noodles, white rice, wheat flour, and cassava.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused a change in the consumption pattern of food sources of carbohydrates in households in Central Java. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the proportion of expenditure on rice, wheat flour, shelled corn, cassava, and potatoes increased. On the other hand, wet corn, instant noodles, and white rice decreased. Research [35] shows that the COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increase in the consumption of food sources of carbohydrates, namely grains, and a decrease in the consumption of processed food.\nThe analysis results based on place of residence show that during the pandemic, the proportion of expenditure on rice in cities decreased, while instant noodles and white rice increased. This indicates that in urban areas, the consumption of food sources of carbohydrates in the form of food is greater. Limiting activities outside the home makes households prefer food sources of carbohydrates in the form of ready-to-eat foods, namely white rice, or more practical foods, namely instant noodles."

            "text": "COVID-19 pandemic\nFood consumption analysis is conducted to study what and how different factors affect food consumption. In general, the factors that influence food consumption include the price of the goods, the prices of other related goods, income, preferences, technology, population size, and other factors [49]. Table 2 presents the determinants of household food consumption of carbohydrates in Central Java before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe results of the estimation of the AIDS model presented in Table 2 show that before and during the COVID19 pandemic, the price factor significantly affected the consumption of all carbohydrate-source food commodities. The price coefficient is positive, indicating that when the price of carbohydrate-sourced food increases,\nthe proportion of expenditure on that carbohydrate-sourced food increases. Household income is also a factor that significantly affects the consumption of all food commodities as a source of carbohydrates. The coefficient of household income is negative, indicating that when there is an increase in income, the proportion of expenditure on food as a carbohydrate source decreases. Bennett\u2019s law states that at lowincome levels, food consumption is prioritized on energydense foods derived from carbohydrates, and vice versa. When income increases, energy consumption from carbohydrates decreases [1].\nBefore and during the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of household members significantly positively affected the consumption of rice, wheat flour, shelled corn, instant noodles, and white rice. The number of household members also affects the consumption of cassava and potatoes during the pandemic. The positive coefficient of household members indicates that when there is an increase in the number of household members, the proportion of household expenditure on food commodities that are carbohydrate sources increases. This is because food sources of carbohydrates, especially rice, are staple foods, so when the number of household members increases, the amount that must be purchased will increase. The rice coefficient value during the pandemic (0.018821) was greater than in the pre-pandemic period (0.01292). This condition was caused during the COVID-19 pandemic, and therewas an increase in prices, so household expenditure on rice increased.\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic, the residence location significantly affected the consumption of rice and instant noodles. This means there are differences in the consumption of these commodities in rural and urban areas. The positive coefficient indicates that the proportion of spending on rice and instant noodles in urban areas is greater than in rural areas. During the COVID19 pandemic, location factors significantly affected the consumption of rice, wheat flour, wet-skinned corn, cassava, potatoes, and instant noodles with a negative coefficient except for instant noodles which were positive. This shows that the expenditure on rice, wheat flour, wet-skinned corn, cassava, and potatoes is greater in rural areas than in urban areas. Meanwhile, the proportion of instant noodle expenditure is greater in urban areas.\nHousehold consumption of carbohydrate food sources is also influenced by the prices of other commodities, namely cooking oil, chicken eggs, chicken meat, beef, tofu, tempeh, red chili, shallots, catfish, and preserved milkfish.\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic, the price of cooking oil positively affected the consumption of wet-skinned corn,\nshelled corn, and cassava and negatively affected the consumption of instant noodles and white rice. Meanwhile, during the COVID-19 pandemic, cooking oil had a positive effect on wet-skinned corn and a negative effect on wheat flour and cassava. This shows that before the COVID-19 pandemic, when the price of cooking oil increased, the proportion of spending on wet-skinned corn, shelled corn, and cassava increased, and the proportion of spending on instant noodles and white rice decreased. Meanwhile, during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the price of cooking oil increased, the proportion of expenditure for wet-skinned corn, wheat flour, and cassava decreased.\nThe price of chicken eggs positively affected the consumption of wet-skinned corn, shelled corn, cassava, and instant noodles in the period before the COVID-19 pandemic. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the price of chicken eggs positively affected rice consumption and negatively affected the consumption of cassava and white rice. The positive effect shows that when there is an increase in the price of chicken eggs, the proportion of expenditure for these commodities increases. At the same time, the negative effect shows that when the price of chicken eggs increases, the proportion of expenditure on food commodities that are carbohydrate sources decreases. The price of chicken meat harms consuming food sources of carbohydrates before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. When the price of chicken meat increases, the proportion of expenditure on rice, wheat flour, wet-skinned corn, cassava, potatoes, and instant noodles decreases. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the price of beef had a positive effect on the consumption of rice, wheat flour, and instant noodles.\nMeanwhile, during the pandemic, the price of beef positively affected the consumption of rice, wheat flour, potatoes, and white rice and harmed the consumption of cassava. The positive effect shows that when there is an increase in the price of chicken meat, the proportion of expenditure for that commodity increases. Meanwhile, the negative effect indicates that when the price of chicken meat increases, the proportion of expenditure on these food commodities decreases.\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic, the price of tofu did not affect the consumption of food sources of carbohydrates. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the price of tofu harmed rice consumption. A negative coefficient indicates that if there is an increase in the price of tofu, the proportion of spending on rice will decrease. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the price of tempeh had a positive effect on rice consumption and a negative effect on the consumption of wet-skinned and shelled corn. This shows that when the price of tempeh increases, the proportion of rice expenditure increases, while the proportion of expenditure\non wet and shelled corn decreases. Meanwhile, during the pandemic, the price of tempeh negatively affected the consumption of instant noodles, which means that when the price of tempeh increases, the proportion of spending on instant noodles decreases.\nThe price of red chili harms the consumption of rice, wheat flour, shelled corn, and cassava in the period before the COVID-19 pandemic. This means that when the price of chili increases, the proportion of expenditure on rice, wheat flour, shelled corn, and cassava decreases. Meanwhile, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the price of red chili positively affected the consumption of rice, wheat flour, and white rice and harmed the consumption of cassava and potatoes. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the price of shallots positively affected the consumption of wet-skinned corn and shelled corn and harmed the consumption of potatoes and instant noodles. Meanwhile, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the price of shallots positively affected the consumption of rice and cassava and negatively affected the consumption of wheat and white rice. The positive effect shows that when the price of shallots increases, the proportion of expenditure on these commodities increases. At the same time, the negative effect shows that when the price of shallots increases, the proportion of expenditure on food commodities that are carbohydrate sources decreases.\nBefore and during the COVID-19 pandemic, catfish prices negatively affected the consumption of rice, cassava, potatoes, wheat flour, and instant noodles. This shows that when there is an increase in the price of catfish, the proportion of expenditure on rice, wheat flour, cassava, potatoes, and instant noodles decreases. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the price of processed milkfish negatively affected rice and potato consumption. Meanwhile, during the COVID-19 pandemic, processed milkfish prices harmed rice consumption and positively affected white rice consumption. This means that when the price of processed milkfish increases, the proportion of expenditure on rice decreases, while that for white rice increases."

            "text": "Changes in the price of goods, income, and prices of other related goods, either substitutes or complements, will affect the demand for goods with different effects for each commodity. The sensitivity of consumption of carbohydratesource foods to these changes is measured by own-price elasticity, expenditure elasticity, and cross-price elasticity.\nTable 3 shows the price and income elasticity for each carbohydrate-source food commodity studied under conditions before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAccording to economic theory, the price elasticity of a commodity is expected to have a negative sign, which indicates a negative slope on the demand curve. Table 3 shows that prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the OwnPrice elasticity for rice was negative, while for other carbohydrate-source food commodities, it was positive. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Own-Price elasticity for all carbohydrate-source food commodities was positive.\nThe Own-Price elasticity of rice commodity has a negative sign of 0.0553, indicating that when there is an increase in the price of rice by 1%, the consumption of rice decreases by 0.0553%. An elasticity value of less than 1 indicates that rice consumption is inelastic. Rice is a staple food consumed by all households, so price changes do not affect rice consumption much. This result is in line with previous research, which shows that rice consumption is inelastic, namely the elasticity of rice prices in Java is \u22120.424 [47]; rice price elasticity of \u22120.42 for high-income households and \u22120.87 for lowincome households [50]; the price elasticity of rice in East Java is below 0.5 [40]; and the price elasticity of rice in South Sumatra is \u22120.59 [51].\nThe price elasticity of Own-Price for food commodities with a positive sign indicates that when prices fall, the consumption of food sources of carbohydrates decreases and vice versa. This condition is an exception to the normal conditions of the law of demand. Two types of items exhibit this behavior: Veblen items and Giffen items. Veblen goods are a status symbol, and their exclusivity makes them desirable, characterized by their price elasticity and their income elasticity is positive. While Giffen\ngoods are \u201cinferior\u201d goods, the price elasticity is positive [52].\nThe results of the income elasticity analysis show that before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, wheat flour, wet-skinned corn, shelled corn, potatoes, white rice, and cassava in the pre-pandemic period were inferior goods because the income elasticity was negative. These commodities are Giffen goods if it is associated with their positive price elasticity. This also happened to cassava before the pandemic. When prices fall, consumption of these commodities also decreases because households allocate income to food sources of carbohydrates that have higher social value, such as rice. This is because households will allocate the Giffen paradox phenomenon that has occurred in Ireland for potato consumption [53].\nIncome elasticity for rice and instant noodles before and during the pandemic and cassava during the pandemic was positive, indicating that all three were normal goods. An elasticity value of less than 1 indicates that all three staple goods are. If it is associated with the value of the price elasticity itself, which is positive, it indicates that the three commodities are Veblen goods. Veblen [54] reveals that a person\u2019s satisfaction in consuming is not seen by how much benefit is felt from the goods consumed but by how much the assessment of others is the effect of consuming the item or can be interpreted as a show-off effect (Veblen Effect). During the pandemic, household purchasing power decreased, so consuming rice and instant noodles was more prestigious than cheaper carbohydrate sources.\nTable 3 also shows that before and during the pandemic, the Own-Price elasticity of all carbohydrate-source foods except rice was greater than the income elasticity. This means that price changes than income changes more influence the consumption of food sources of carbohydrates other than rice. Meanwhile, rice consumption is more influenced by changes in income.\nCross-price elasticity shows the percentage change in the number of goods consumed due to changes in prices of other related commodities, cateris paribus. Cross-price elasticity is important because consumers will adjust the composition of the goods purchased if there is a change in the price of other related goods. A positive cross-price elasticity value indicates that the two commodities are substitutes, while a negative cross-price elasticity value indicates the complementary relationship between the two commodities. The cross-price elasticity of consumption of food sources of carbohydrates before and during the COVID-19 pandemic is presented in Table 4.\nTable 4 shows that the cross-price elasticity between food commodity sources of carbohydrates before the\npandemic was positive, except for white rice, which was negative. The positive cross-price elasticity indicates that the carbohydrate-source food commodities have a substitution relationship. This is in line with the study\u2019s results [22] that wheat flour and instant noodles are substitutes for rice. The cross-elasticity values of wheat flour and instant noodles to rice were 0.005 and 0.007. This means that for every 1% increase in flour prices, rice consumption will increase by 0.005%, and when the price of instant noodles rises by 1%, rice consumption will increase by 0.007%. The cross-price elasticity of rice to instant noodle consumption is 0.1125, which means that every 1% increase in rice price will increase the consumption of instant noodles by 0.1125%. This shows that changes in rice prices have more effect on instant noodle consumption than changes in instant noodle prices on rice consumption. Rice, as the Indonesian population\u2019s staple food, makes it less affected by changes in food prices for other carbohydrate sources. The negative cross-elasticity of white rice indicates that white rice has a complementary relationship with rice, wet-skinned corn, and shelled corn. During the COVID-19 pandemic, more carbohydratesource food commodities were complementary to other carbohydrate-source commodities than in the pre-pandemic period. Shelled corn and cassava are complementary to rice. Wet-skinned corn is a complement to\ncassava. Instant noodles complement cassava, and white rice complements cassava and instant noodles. Rice is a complement to instant noodles. During the pandemic, these three commodities were consumed to complement each other. Limited incomes and price increases during the pandemic have made the consumption of food sources of carbohydrates consumed as a complement.\nBefore and during the COVID-19 pandemic, most of the other food commodities, namely chicken eggs, chicken meat, beef, red chilies, shallots, and catfish, had a positive cross-price elasticity value, meaning that these commodities were substitutes for carbohydrate-source foods. When the prices of these commodities rise, their consumption decreases and they are replaced by food sources of carbohydrates. Meanwhile, preserved tofu andmilkfish are complementary goods for rice. Research [33] found that during the COVID-19 pandemic, low-income households (quintiles I, II, and III) reduced their demand for nutritious food and consumed more carbohydrate-sourced foods."

            "text": "There were differences in consumption patterns of food sources of carbohydrates before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The food consumption pattern of carbohydrate sources in this study was seen based on the proportion of expenditure on food sources of carbohydrates to total food expenditure. Household allocates higher consumption expenditures for rice compared to other commodities. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the proportion of expenditure on rice, wheat flour, shelled corn, cassava, and potatoes increased, while for wet corn, instant noodles, and white rice, they decreased.\nBefore and during the COVID-19 pandemic, price and income significantly affected the consumption of all carbohydrate-source food commodities. The price coefficient itself is positive, while the income coefficient is negative. The number of household members positively affects the consumption of most carbohydrate foods both before and during the study. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the location of residence affected the consumption of rice, wheat flour, wet-skinned corn, cassava, potatoes, and instant noodles, with a negative coefficient except for instant noodles.\nOwn-price and income elasticity show that before the pandemic, rice was a normal good with consumption being inelastic. Before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, wheat flour, wet-skinned corn, shelled corn, potatoes, white rice, and cassava in the pre-pandemic period\nwere Giffen goods because the price elasticity itself was positive and the income elasticity was negative. Meanwhile, rice during the pandemic, instant noodles before and during the pandemic, and cassava were Veblen goods because their price and income elasticity were positive. The cross-price elasticity shows that before the pandemic, most of the relationships between food sources of carbohydrates were substitutes, meanwhile during the COVID19 pandemic, more carbohydrate-source food commodities were complementary to other carbohydrate-source commodities. Before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, chicken eggs, chicken meat, beef, red chilies, shallots, and catfish were substitutes for food sources of carbohydrates. Tofu and preserved milkfish are complementary to rice during the pandemic.\nBefore and during the pandemic, rice was the main source of carbohydrates, and the consumption was influenced by prices and income. During the COVID-19 pandemic, more carbohydrate-source food commodities were complementary to other carbohydrate-source commodities. That means during a pandemic, the consumption of carbohydrates is more, which means that the quality of food is reduced. So effort is needed from the government to maintain the stability of prices of food in the market and to increase income in order to increase the quantity and quality of food consumption.\nAcknowledgments: The authors would like to thank to Universitas Sebelas Maret and the Central Statistic Agency of Central Java for their supports.\nFunding information: This article is part of a dissertation research called Consumption and Household Food Security in Central Java which Sebelas Maret University funds.\nConflict of interest: The authors state no conflict of interest.\nData availability statement: The datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request."
