            "text": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem disease that affects one or more organs, with periods of flare or remission. Its diagnosis is based on clinical evidence of characteristic serological abnormalities, for example antinuclear and more specific autoantibodies, like antidsDNA and anti-Sm [1]. Due to its multisystem characteristic, SLE has a wide spectrum of manifestations: since mild manifestations as fatigue, arthralgia, and oral ulcerations, until more severe manifestations: kidney, hematological and neurological diseases [2, 3].\nTreatments of flares of SLE are based on the severity of organ(s) involvement using drugs\nsuch as hydroxychloroquine or glucocorticoids [1]. The primary aim of the treatment is to achieve remission or low disease activity and prevention flares [1]. Although the use of glucocorticoids is necessary, prolonged use of this medication has adverse effects, such as changes in body composition (weight gain) and lipid profile [3].\nObesity and overweight are identified as risk factors for flare in patients with SLE, by the\nexpression of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) [4, 5]. In addition, serum lipid levels tend to increase during the active disease course compared to the non-active disease. Thus, it is important to manage obesity because it is a modifiable risk factor and comorbidity in patients with SLE since it may worsen disease activity that can limit functionality and quality of life [6]. Studies of other autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease) have shown that obesity can also negatively affect disease activity [7, 8].\nThe impact of overweight and obesity on disease activity and remission in SLE remains\nunclear, and most studies conducted focused on describing the nutritional status of patients with SLE [9] without evaluating the influence of overweight and obesity on disease activity and remission.\nThus, it is important to investigate this association since treatment is aimed at achieving\nremission of the disease. We aimed to provide a systematic review protocol to summarize the scientific evidence regarding the impact of overweight and obesity on disease activity and remission in SLE."

To diagnose overweight and obesity, the authors should adopt a reference from the World Health Organization [13], which people with body mass index (BMI) between 25\u2013 30 kg/m2 are considered with overweight and people with BMI over 30 kg/m2 are considered with obesity. We will include studies that evaluate overweight and obese groups measured by body mass index category or visceral fat or body composition (percentage of body fat).\nThe primary outcomes evaluated in this systematic review are disease activity and remission\nrates. These outcomes are chosen because measurement of disease activity in SLE is central to clinical research when evaluating clinical outcomes, comparing meaningful differences among SLE patient groups, and assessing disease activity longitudinally in observational and clinical trials [14]. The therapeutic goal of any given treatment intended for chronic use is to induce a clinically relevant reduction in the activity of the disease that is maintained in the long term [15].\nMany scales are available for disease activity. Composite disease activity measures are used\nfor overall disease activity, which often reflects multiple organ involvement with many serological abnormalities [16]. We will select studies that used the the main tool to evaluate disease activity, SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI), with scores ranging from 0 to 105 points, and the disease is classified as active when the patient presents above 1 point.

For patients receiving steroids, including those who are steroid-dependent, the goal of treatment is steroid-free or at least to achieve a low steroid dose to maintain remission [15].\nThe secondary outcomes are inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, lep-\ntin, homocysteine, and complement components C3 and C4), and other pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines measured in serum/plasma. Studies have shown that increased inflammatory markers are associated with active SLE or flare, indicating that treatment may fail. Few studies have evaluated the effects of overweight and obesity on these inflammatory markers in patients with SLE [17, 18]."

            "text": "Obesity is associated with complications in diverse autoimmune diseases and is very common in patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases, of which 27% and 37% of patients with\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287753 June 29, 2023 6 / 9\nrheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis, respectively have a body mass index\ufffd30 kg/m2 [24]. In patients with SLE, the frequency of obesity is similar or higher than that in the general population, with a prevalence ranging from 28% to 50%, and it has been implicated as a risk factor for exacerbation of clinical manifestations of disease and inflammatory processes [25]. It may be attributed because one of the characteristics of obesity is a state of chronic low-grade inflammation. This condition induces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and adipokynes such as leptin, produced by white adipose tissue [26]. A meta-analysis demonstrated that patients with SLE have higher levels of leptin compared to control group. Leptin is responsible for activating monocytes/macrophages to release proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a and IL-6, activates monocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages, and stimulates the differentiation of T lymphocytes into Th1 phenotype. [27] Furthermore, oxidative stress caused by obesity can lead inflammation through the transition of adipose tissue macrophages from M2 to M1, leading T cells recruitment [28]. Another study supported the hypothesis that obesity promotes disease activity in psoriatic arthritis [29]. In inflammatory rheumatic diseases, it has been hypothesized that patients with obesity tend to have low response rates for antirheumatic drugs (conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs) and biological drugs [24]. A study with patients with rheumatic diseases suggests that patients with obesity may require more time of treatment to achieve minimal activity disease [30]. But it is necessary to understand if patients with SLE have the same response.\nStudies on the impact of obesity on disease activity and remission in SLE are scarce and generally focus on describing the nutritional status of patients with SLE [9]. Therefore, this study will contribute to providing objective evidence about the impact of obesity on disease activity and remission in SLE, since obesity is a modifiable risk factor responsible for increased disease activity and an altered lipid profile. Excess adiposity is associated with a greater symptom burden, such as cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidemia), atherosclerosis, and metabolic syndrome, and they impact the quality of life, a neglected area by some clinicians. This evidence may help clinicians offer the best treatment for patients, optimize disease outcomes, and improve their quality of life [4, 6].\nThis systematic review may have limitations, as it will include only observational studies. If\nmost of the included studies are cross-sectional or case-control, it would preclude a reliable assessment of the causal relationship between obesity and disease activity and remission in SLE. Other limitations regarding study characteristics, such as sample size and the limited number of studies, can also influence the validity and reliability of the findings. Furthermore, BMI, one of the methods used to measure obesity, does not distinguish fat and leans mass. Despite these limitations, the review team will use a rigorous process to identify and analyze studies that respond to this systematic review. The purpose of the protocol was justified because systematic review findings may represent quality evidence proving that overweight and obesity impede treatment of SLE in adults. A better understanding of the impact of overweight and obesity on disease activity and remission in SLE is essential to optimize disease outcomes and offer patients a better quality of life."
