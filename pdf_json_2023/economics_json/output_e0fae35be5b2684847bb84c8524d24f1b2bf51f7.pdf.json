            "text": "In November 1896 when America\u2019s first large-scale power plant at Niagara Falls began transmitting electricity to the city of Buffalo about 20 miles away, the electricity came in the form of alternating current. The reason was that \u201cunlike direct current, alternating current [could] travel \u201d (Bakke, 2016, p. 48). Most electricity grids still rely on alternating current today. The frequency of the alternating current is an indicator of the mismatch between electricity demand and supply.\nThe purpose of frequency regulation is to insure electricity grids against unforeseen secondto-second supply and demand mismatches. Traditionally, this insurance has been provided by centralized power plants, often fired by fossil fuels. As wind and solar power plants replace fossilfuel-fired power plants, power generation becomes more weather-dependent, which may increase the demand for and decrease the supply of frequency regulation. Electricity storage could help to fill the gap. Lithium-ion batteries, in particular, are considered a promising source of frequency regulation,\nar X\niv :2\n30 6.\n02 98\n7v 1\n[ m\nat h.\nO C\n] 5\nJ un\n2 02\n3\nthanks to their fast dynamics and rapid cost decline (Ziegler and Trancik, 2021).\nSeveral studies (Wu et al., 2022; Hu et al., 2022) have claimed that it is or will be profitable to invest in lithium-ion batteries for frequency regulation in the near future. Such studies focused on battery costs and frequency regulation prices but they often did not explicitly model the uncertain demand for frequency regulation. In our previous work (Lauinger et al., 2022), we accounted for EU delivery guarantees on frequency regulation (European Commission, 2017) and found that they significantly reduce the expected profits from frequency regulation. We also showed that the profits depend on charging and discharging efficiencies, and on the dispersion of frequency deviations.\nIn this work, we focus on two research questions:\n1. How do charging and discharging losses influence frequency regulation profits?\n2. What regulatory changes would make frequency regulation with storage more profitable?\nTo answer these questions, we derive an analytical solution to a simplified decision-making problem of a storage operator selling frequency regulation in the continental European electricity grid and trading electricity on day-ahead wholesale or retail markets. We distill the following insights:\n1. Although frequency deviations vanish on average, the average power flow entering a storage\ndevice is nonincreasing in the amount of regulation power offered. The lower the roundtrip efficiency of the storage device and the higher the dispersion of the frequency deviations, the higher the dissipative losses incurred by the provision of regulation power. In a numerical case-study, we find that the losses amount to between 0.6% and 4.3% of the regulation power offered to grid operators. To our best knowledge, we are the first to quantify the expected dissipative losses as a function of roundtrip efficiency and frequency deviation dispersion.\n2. For storage devices that are constrained by their storage capacity and their initial state-\nof-charge, rather than their charging and discharging capacities, the profits from frequency regualtion over the lifetime of the devices are inversely proportional to the length of time for which frequency regulation must be committed.\n3. EU regulators can make frequency regulation with storage more profitable if they (i) make it\neasier for small-scale storage operators to access wholesale electricity markets, or (ii) establish an intraday market for frequency regulation.\nWhile the analytical solution provides general insights in storage operation, it requires several simplifying assumptions and may thus be of limited practical value for the operation of any specific storage device. The general insights can, however, be used as a base line against which storage operators can compare the results of more detailed operational models. We describe the simplifying assumptions below and explain how they can be addressed in operational models.\nFirst, we assume that charging and discharging losses are constant. In reality, the losses depend on the instantaneous state-of-charge of the storage device, the charging and discharging power, and temperature. Nguyen et al. (2019) formulated a dynamic program to account for decision-dependent losses and found them to reduce regulation profits by 10% to 20% for lithium-ion batteries.\nSecond, we assume that storage operators only trade on day-ahead markets and that they must commit to constant market bids throughout the entire day. In practice, they could participate on intraday markets for the wholesale of electricity. L\u00f6hndorf and Wozabal (2023) and Kraft et al. (2023) developed multi-stage stochastic programs for participation in day-ahead and intraday markets. They found higher expected profits on intraday than day-ahead markets. L\u00f6hndorf and Wozabal pointed out that these profits can only be fully realized by assets with a low price impact.\nThird, we assume no market power. This is reasonable for small storage assets, such as stationary batteries, whereas large storage assets, such as pooled pumped-hydro power plants may exert some market power. Bj\u00f8rndal et al. (2023) formulated a Stackelberg game to analyze the market power of monopolistic storage operators under various EU market regulations. Virasjoki et al. (2020) developed a bi-level optimization model to assess the market power of electricity producers. They found that electricity producers can reduce storage investments if they exert market power.\nFinally, we do not consider any battery degradation. Uddin et al. (2018) have shown that battery degradation can be negligible for electric vehicles providing frequency regulation depending on the operating conditions. Other storage technologies may experience different degradation dynamics. Vatandoust et al. (2019) formulated a stochastic mixed-integer linear program that accounts for battery degradation. They found that storage operators will want to protect themselves against deep battery discharges, which are particularly harmful to battery longevity, by limiting the amount of regulation power they sell to grid operators.\nIn terms of methodological development, we use a constraint on the expected terminal stateof-charge, rather than a value function as in Lauinger et al. (2022), to steer the storage operator\ntoward decisions that work well for both the present and the future.\nExpected value constraints have previously been investigated by Dentcheva and Ruszczy\u0144ski (2003) to establish stochastic dominance of the second order, by Rigollet and Tong (2011) in hypothesis testing, and by Fonseca and Junca (2021) as a generalization of mean-variance models.\nHere, we will use them for analytical tractability. We show in Section 3 that the amount of power bought on electricity markets is an implicit function of the amount of regulation power sold to grid operators under the expected value constraint. This leads to a one-dimensional decision problem, which we can be solved highly efficiently by bisection for general frequency deviation distributions (see Section 4) and analytically for two- and three-point distributions (see Section 5).\nTo ease readability, we refer to generic electricity storage devices as batteries and relegate all essential proofs to Appendix A and all other proofs to the supplementary material (SM). The SM also includes additional description and analysis of the case study presented in Section 6.\nNotation. We designate all random variables by tilde signs. Their realizations are denoted by the same symbols without tilde signs. For any z \u2208 R, we set [z]+ = max{z, 0} and [z]\u2212 = max{\u2212z, 0}. For any closed intervals T ,U \u2286 R, we define L(T ,U) as the space of all Riemann integrable functions f : T \u2192 U , and we denote the intersection of a set B \u2286 L(T ,R) with L(T ,R+) as B+. For any signed function \u03b4 \u2208 L(T ,R), we denote by |\u03b4| the absolute value function with |\u03b4|(t) = |\u03b4(t)| for every t \u2208 T . We use g\u2032\u2212 and g\u2032+ to denote the left and right derivatives of a univariate proper convex function g : R \u2192 (\u2212\u221e,+\u221e], respectively."

The power xb bought on the market is priced at p\u0303b(t). The expected cost over the planning horizon T thus amounts to\nE \u222b T p\u0303b(t)xb \u2212 ( p\u0303a(t)\u2212 \u03b4\u0303(t)p\u0303d(t) ) xr dt.\nThe net power flow leaving the grid at time t \u2208 T is given by xb + \u03b4(t)xr. In the following, we find it useful to distinguish the charging power y+(xb, xr, \u03b4(t)) = [xb+\u03b4(t)xr]+ from the discharging power y\u2212(xb, xr, \u03b4(t)) = [xb + \u03b4(t)xr]\u2212. We assume that the charging power is bounded above by the charging capacity y\u0304+ \u2208 R+, and the discharging power is bounded above by the discharging capacity y\u0304\u2212 \u2208 R+. When the battery is charging (y+ > 0), then only a fraction \u03b7+ of the charging power enters the battery, where \u03b7+ \u2208 (0, 1] represents the charging efficiency. The rest is dissipated during the charging process. Conversely, when the battery is discharging (y\u2212 > 0), then a multiple 1 \u03b7\u2212 of the discharging power leaves the battery, where \u03b7\n\u2212 \u2208 (0, 1] represents the discharging efficiency. The battery state-of-charge at any time t \u2208 T can thus be expressed as\ny ( xb, xr, \u03b4, y0, t ) = y0 + \u222b t 0 \u03b7+y+ ( xb, xr, \u03b4(t\u2032) ) \u2212 1 \u03b7\u2212 y\u2212 ( xb, xr, \u03b4(t\u2032) ) dt\u2032, (1)\nwhere y0 denotes the initial state-of-charge, and \u03b4 \u2208 L(T , [\u22121, 1]) is a given frequency deviation trajectory. Throughout the planning horizon, the battery state-of-charge must remain between 0 and the battery capacity y\u0304 > 0. We assume from now on that 0 \u2264 y0 \u2264 y\u0304. The following proposition establishes fundamental qualitative properties of the state-of-charge function y.\nProposition 1. All else being equal, the battery state-of-charge y(xb, xr, \u03b4, y0, t) is concave and strictly increasing in xb, concave in xr, concave nondecreasing in \u03b4, and affine nondecreasing in y0.\nProposition 1 slightly strengthens Proposition 1 by Lauinger et al. (2022).\nThe battery may be used beyond the immediate planning horizon T for selling more regulation power, for exchanging power on other electricity markets, or for supplying power to electric devices. The extent to which this is possible depends on the state-of-charge at the end of the immediate planning horizon. The value of any particular terminal state-of-charge y(xb, xr, \u03b4, y0, T ) could be captured by a reward-to-go function as in dynamic programming (Bertsekas, 1976). This allows the battery operator to trade off present and future costs when selecting xb and xr. Another approach is to constrain the terminal state-of-charge to be close to some target y\u22c6 that will guarantee satisfactory future performance. Both terminal costs and terminal constraints are widely studied in model predictive control (Mayne et al., 2000).\nThe terminal state-of-charge is uncertain at time 0 when the battery operator selects xb and xr because it depends on the frequency deviation trajectory \u03b4 during the planning horizon T . In fact, the battery operator can only be sure to meet a fixed target y\u22c6 if she sells no regulation power (xr = 0), which shields her from the uncertainty of the frequency deviations. If she sells regulation power (xr > 0), however, then all she can hope for is to reach a terminal state-of-charge that is close to the target y\u22c6 on average. In the following, we will thus require that the terminal state-of-charge be equal to y\u22c6 in expectation. We emphasize that this constraint is not dictated by physics but is simply a means to contain future operating costs, which are not modeled explicitly.\nThroughout the planning horizon, the battery operator must be able to honor all market commitments for all reasonably likely frequency deviation trajectories \u03b4. Anvari et al. (2020) show that extreme frequency deviation trajectories are very uncommon. It would thus appear overly conservative to impose the charging, discharging, and battery state-of-charge constraints robustly for all possible frequency deviation trajectories. Inspired by applicable regulations by the European Commission (2017), we assume instead that the battery operator must satisfy the constraints only for the frequency deviation trajectories in the uncertainty set\nD = { \u03b4 \u2208 L(T , [\u22121, 1]) : \u222b T |\u03b4(t)| dt \u2264 \u03b3 } parametrized by the uncertainty budget \u03b3 \u2208 (0, T ]. Note that \u03b3 represents the maximum amount of time for which a scenario \u03b4 \u2208 D may adopt an extreme value \u03b4(t) \u2208 {\u22121, 1}. Note also that D can be seen as an extension of the budget uncertainty sets introduced by Bertsimas and Sim (2004) to functional uncertainties. The following lemma establishes symmetry properties of D that will allow us to reduce the decision problem of the battery operator to a deterministic optimization problem.\nLemma 1. We have \u03b4 \u2208 D if and only if |\u03b4| \u2208 D+.\nIn summary, the battery operator\u2019s decision problem is to select xb and xr so as to minimize expected costs while meeting the battery state-of-charge target y\u22c6 in expectation and ensuring that the charger, discharger, and battery capacities are respected at all times and under all frequency deviation trajectories \u03b4 \u2208 D. This gives rise to the following robust optimization problem.\nmin xb\u2208R, xr\u2208R+ E \u222b T p\u0303b(t)xb \u2212 ( p\u0303a(t)\u2212 \u03b4\u0303(t)p\u0303d(t) ) xr dt\ns.t. y+(xb, xr, \u03b4(t)) \u2264 y\u0304+ \u2200\u03b4 \u2208 D, \u2200t \u2208 T\ny\u2212(xb, xr, \u03b4(t)) \u2264 y\u0304\u2212 \u2200\u03b4 \u2208 D, \u2200t \u2208 T\ny(xb, xr, \u03b4, y0, t) \u2264 y\u0304 \u2200\u03b4 \u2208 D, \u2200t \u2208 T\ny(xb, xr, \u03b4, y0, t) \u2265 0 \u2200\u03b4 \u2208 D, \u2200t \u2208 T E [ y(xb, xr, \u03b4\u0303, y0, T ) ] = y\u22c6\n(R)\nThe battery operator only needs to insure frequency deviation trajectories in D. For trajectories outside of D, the battery operator has to deliver regulation power up to the smallest time instant t\u03b3 such that \u222b t\u03b3 0 |\u03b4(t)| dt = \u03b3. At all time instants t > t\u03b3 , the battery operator does not need to deliver any regulation power and may assume that \u03b4(t) = 0. We thus assume that P[\u03b4\u0303 \u2208 D] = 1 throughout the rest of the paper. For later use, we note that any \u03b4 \u2208 D has a mean absolute deviation 1T \u222b T |\u03b4(t)| dt no greater than \u03b3 T .\nFor a fixed frequency deviation trajectory \u03b4, the textbook approach to solving the deterministic counterpart of problem (R) is to first discretize the planning horizon into N periods and then introduce N binary variables expressing whether the battery is charging or discharging during the respective periods (Taylor, 2015, p. 85). This results in a large-scale mixed-integer linear program. In the remainder, we will show that the robust opimization problem (R) is much easier to solve than its deterministic counterpart. In fact, we will see that for realistic values of the roundtrip efficiency \u03b7+\u03b7\u2212 the search space can be reduced to merely three candidate solutions. All candidate solutions can be computed highly efficiently by bisection. For specific distributions of the frequency deviations, problem (R) can even be solved in closed form. This implies that robustification reduces complexity. In the next section, we first show that the robust optimization problem (R) is equivalent to a one-dimensional deterministic optimization problem."

            "text": "In order to simplify problem (R), we first rewrite its objective function as an explicit linear function of the decision variables. Next, we show that the robust constraints are equivalent to deterministic linear constraints. Finally, we exploit the terminal state-of-charge constraint to express xb as an implicit function of xr, which allows us to reformulate problem (R) only in terms of xr.\nNote first that the objective function of problem (R) can be expressed as T (cbxb \u2212 crxr), where cb = E 1T \u222b T p\u0303 b(t) dt denotes the expected average market price of electricity, and cr = E 1T \u222b T p\u0303\na(t)\u2212 \u03b4\u0303(t)p\u0303d(t) dt denotes the expected average price of regulation power. In the following, we will assume without much loss of generality that cb > 0 and cr > 0.\nWe now show that the robust constraints are equivalent to deterministic linear constraints. This may be surprising because the state-of-charge is concave in the decision variables, implying that the upper bounds on the state-of-charge represent nonconvex constraints. Similarly, as the state-of-charge is concave in \u03b4, finding the worst-case frequency deviation trajectories for the lower bounds on the state-of-charge amounts to solving a nonconvex optimization problem. In addition to these complications, the bounds on the state-of-charge also need to hold for all time instants in the planning horizon. In general, constraints with such properties are severely intractable. Given that xb and xr do not depend on time, it is tempting to think that \u03b4 can be restricted to a constant function of time without loss of generality. This restriction of the uncertainty set, however, relaxes the feasible set, and one can show that the relaxed feasible set contains decisions that are infeasible in practice. Indeed, averaging the real frequency deviation signals underestimates the maximum state-of-charge and overestimates the minimum state-of-charge (Lauinger et al., 2022, Example 1).\nAlthough the robust constraints of problem (R) seem intractable, we can reformulate them as deterministic linear constraints. This is possible because the worst-case frequency deviation trajectories and the worst-case time instants can be evaluated a priori. The following proposition summarizes our results.\nProposition 2 (Constraint reduction). If 0 \u2264 y0 \u2264 y\u0304, then the following equivalences hold.\n(i) y+(xb, xr, \u03b4(t)) \u2264 y\u0304+ \u2200\u03b4 \u2208 D, \u2200t \u2208 T \u21d0\u21d2 xr + xb \u2264 y\u0304+\n(ii) y\u2212(xb, xr, \u03b4(t)) \u2264 y\u0304\u2212 \u2200\u03b4 \u2208 D, \u2200t \u2208 T \u21d0\u21d2 xr \u2212 xb \u2264 y\u0304\u2212 (iii) y(xb, xr, \u03b4, y0, t) \u2264 y\u0304 \u2200\u03b4 \u2208 D, \u2200t \u2208 T \u21d0\u21d2 xr +max { T\n\u03b3 xb, xb\n} \u2264 y\u0304 \u2212 y0\n\u03b7+\u03b3 (iv) y(xb, xr, \u03b4, y0, t) \u2265 0 \u2200\u03b4 \u2208 D, \u2200t \u2208 T \u21d0\u21d2 xr \u2212min { T\n\u03b3 xb, xb\n} \u2264 \u03b7\n\u2212y0 \u03b3\nProposition 2 is inspired by Theorems 1 and 2 by Lauinger et al. (2022). The proof critically exploits the monotonicity properties of y established in Proposition 1 and the symmetry of the uncertainty set D established in Lemma 1. The proof reveals that the upper bound on the charging power and the upper bound on the state-of-charge are valid for all frequency deviations signals \u03b4 \u2208 D and all time instants t \u2208 T if and only if they are valid for the time instants \u03b3 and T and for the particular frequency deviation signal \u03b4(+), defined as \u03b4(+)(t) = 1 if t \u2264 \u03b3 and \u03b4(+)(t) = 0 otherwise. Similarly, the upper bound on the discharging power and the lower bound on the state-of-charge are valid for all frequency deviations signals \u03b4 \u2208 D and all time instants t \u2208 T if and only if they are valid for the time instants \u03b3 and T and for the particular frequency deviation signal \u03b4(\u2212) = \u2212\u03b4(+).\nIntuitively, if xb \u2265 0, then the maximum state-of-charge is achieved at time T by any nonnegative frequency deviation trajectory that exhausts the uncertainty budget, i.e., that has a cumulative deviation of \u03b3, such as \u03b4(+). If xb < 0, then the maximum state-of-charge is achieved at time \u03b3 by the frequency deviation trajectory that exhausts the uncertainty budget as quickly as possible, i.e., that achieves a cumulative deviation of \u03b3 as soon as possible. Since \u03b4 \u2208 L(T , [\u22121, 1]), the nonnegative signal that exhausts the uncertainty budget as quickly as possible is \u03b4(+). As \u03b4(+)(\u03b3) = 1 and \u03b4(t) \u2264 1 for all \u03b4 \u2208 D and all t \u2208 T , the maximum charging power is achieved at time \u03b3 by the frequency deviation trajectory \u03b4(+). The intuition for the lower bound on the state-of-charge and the upper bound on the discharging power is similar.\nIn the following, we will exploit the constraint on the expected terminal state-of-charge to express xb as an implicit function of xr. To this end, we first compress the stochastic process {\u03b4\u0303(t)}t\u2208T to a single random variable \u03be\u0303 = \u03b4\u0303(t\u0303), where t\u0303 is a random time independent of \u03b4\u0303 that follows the uniform distribution on the planning horizon T . The marginal probability distribution P\u03be of \u03be\u0303 is defined through P\u03be[B] = P[\u03be\u0303 \u2208 B] for every Borel set B \u2286 R. One readily verifies that\nP\u03be[B] = P[\u03be\u0303 \u2208 B] = E [ P [ \u03b4\u0303(t\u0303) \u2208 B \u2223\u2223 t\u0303]] = 1 T \u222b T P [ \u03b4\u0303(t\u0303) \u2208 B \u2223\u2223 t\u0303 = t] dt = 1 T \u222b T P [ \u03b4\u0303(t) \u2208 B ] dt\nfor every Borel set B \u2286 T , where the third and the fourth equalities hold because t\u0303 is uniformly distributed on T and because t\u0303 is independent of \u03b4\u0303(t) for every t \u2208 T , respectively. Historical frequency deviation data suggest that the marginal distribution of \u03be\u0303 is symmetric around zero (see Figure 7 in SM B.1.3). From now on, we will thus make the following assumption.\nAssumption 1 (Symmetry). We have P\u03be[B] = P\u03be[\u2212B] for every Borel set B \u2286 T .\nIf the stochastic process {\u03b4\u0303(t)}t\u2208T is stationary, then the marginal distribution of \u03b4\u0303(t) coincides with P\u03be for every t \u2208 T . Based on data from the UK and the continental European electricity grid, Anvari et al. (2020) show, however, that frequency deviations may not be stationary on timescales of up to 24 hours but become stationary on longer timescales. The 24 hour threshold coincides with the typical length of planning horizons for frequency regulation. This suggests that P\u03be does not change from one planning horizon to the next and can thus be estimated from historical data.\nIn the following, we define F : R \u2192 [0, 1] as the cumulative distribution function corresponding to P\u03be, and we define \u03c6 : R \u2192 R+ as the antiderivative of F with \u03c6(\u22121) = 0. For short, we will refer to \u03c6 as the super-cumulative distribution function. We are now ready to investigate the expected terminal state-of-charge as a function of xb and xr. To this end, we define \u03b7d = 1\u03b7\u2212 \u2212 \u03b7+.\nProposition 3 (Properties of the expected terminal state-of-charge). The expected terminal stateof-charge is continuous, jointly concave in xb and xr, strictly increasing and unbounded above in xb, and nonincreasing in xr. In particular, it is given by\nE [ y(xb, xr, \u03b4\u0303, y0, T ) ] = y0 + T ( \u03b7+xb \u2212 \u03b7dxr\u03c6 ( \u2212x b\nxr\n)) \u2200(xb, xr) \u2208 R \u00d7 R+. (2)\nNote that xr\u03c6(\u2212xbxr ) represents the perspective function of \u03c6(\u2212xb), which is jointly convex in xb and xr because \u03c6 is convex (Boyd and Vandenberghe, 2004, p. 89). For xr = 0, the perspective function is defined as limxr\u21920+ xr\u03c6(\u2212x b xr ) and coincides thus with [x b]\u2212.\nWe know from Proposition 1 that the battery state-of-charge is strictly increasing in xb, and thus it is unsurprising that its expected value is also strictly increasing in xb. We emphasize, however, that the state-of-charge may display a complicated nonmonotonic dependence on xr. Nevertheless, Proposition 3 reveals that the expected state-of-charge is nonincreasing in xr, which means that, on average, providing frequency regulation causes energy losses and thereby discharges the battery. Even though the average frequency deviations vanish by virtue of Assumption 1, frequency regulation fails to be energy-neutral unless \u03b7+ = 1 and \u03b7\u2212 = 1. We will explain this phenomenon\nby reasoning about the power flow entering the battery as opposed to the power flow exiting the electricity grid. If there are no losses, then the power flow entering the battery and the power flow exiting the electricity grid coincide with xb + \u03b4(t)xr. They thus follow the same probability distribution as the frequency deviations with the mean value shifted from 0 to xb and the standard deviation scaled by xr. Providing frequency regulation hence only increases the dispersion of the power flow entering the battery but does not affect its mean. In the general case, when \u03b7+, \u03b7\u2212 < 1, the power flow exiting the electricity grid follows the same probability distribution as before, but the power flow entering the battery follows a different probability distribution. In fact, charging losses compress the positive part of the original distribution, while discharging losses stretch the negative part of the original distribution. The losses thereby decrease the average power flow entering the battery. The higher the dispersion of the power flow, the more pronounced the decrease. Since the dispersion increases in xr, the average power flow entering the battery and, by extension, the expected terminal state-of-charge of the battery decrease in xr. Figure 1 visualizes the distribution of the power flow entering the battery for xb = 0 with and without losses.\nThe monotonicity properties of the expected terminal state-of-charge established in Proposition 3 imply that the last constraint of problem (R) determines xb as an implicit function of xr. Instead of reasoning about the state-of-charge of the battery directly, we will continue to reason about the power flow entering the battery, which is independent of the initial state-of-charge y0 and of the length of the planning horizon T . By defining the average expected charging rate and the average desired charging rate as\ny\u0307(xb, xr) = E [ y(xb, xr, \u03b4\u0303, y0, T ) ] \u2212 y0\nT = \u03b7+xb \u2212 \u03b7dxr\u03c6\n( \u2212x b\nxr\n) and y\u0307\u22c6 =\ny\u22c6 \u2212 y0 T ,\nrespectively, the constraint E[y(xb, xr, \u03b4\u0303, y0, T )] = y\u22c6 can be reformulated equivalently as y\u0307(xb, xr) =\ny\u0307\u22c6. Since T > 0, the expected charging rate y\u0307 inherits the concavity and monotonicity properties of the state-of-charge established in Proposition 3. In particular, if xr = 0, then y\u0307(xb, 0) = \u03b7+[xb]+ \u2212 1 \u03b7\u2212 [x b]\u2212. Hence, y\u0307(xb, 0) = y\u0307\u22c6 is valid if and only if xb = 1 \u03b7+\n[y\u0307\u22c6]+\u2212\u03b7\u2212[y\u0307\u22c6]\u2212, which is fully determined by the desired charging rate y\u0307\u22c6 and by the charging and discharging efficiencies \u03b7+ and \u03b7\u2212. As xr increases, the expected charging rate y\u0307(xb, xr) may decrease due to increased charging and discharging losses. The battery operator, however, can compensate this decrease by increasing xb. Since y\u0307 is strictly increasing, continuous, and surjective onto R for any fixed xr, there is a unique xb that satisfies the equation y\u0307(xb, xr) = y\u0307\u22c6. This means that xb can be expressed as an implicit function of xr. This implicit function depends on the desired charging rate y\u0307\u22c6, the charging and discharging efficiencies, and the mean absolute deviation of the frequency deviations. The latter is defined as \u2206 = E[|\u03be\u0303|] = 2\u03c6(0), where the second equality can be proved via integration by parts.\nRemark 1 (Mean absolute deviation). We have \u2206 \u2264 \u03b3T because all relevant frequency deviation trajectories reside in D and have thus a mean absolute deviation no greater than \u03b3T . Formally,\nP [\u03b4 \u2208 D] = 1 =\u21d2 \u2206 \u2264 \u03b3 T .\nProposition 4 (Implicit function). The constraint y\u0307(xb, xr) = y\u0307\u22c6 defines a unique implicit function g : R+ \u2192 R such that y\u0307(g(xr), xr) = y\u0307\u22c6 for all xr \u2208 R+. The function g is convex, continuous, and nondecreasing with derivative\ng\u2032(xr) = \u03b7d \u03c6(\u2212xbxr ) + x b xrF (\u2212x b xr )\n\u03b7+ + \u03b7dF (\u2212xbxr ) (3)\n(if it exists), where xb = g(xr). We have g\u2032(xr) = 0 for all xr \u2208 (0, |g(0)|). In addition, the asymptotic slope m = limxr\u2192\u221e g\u2032(xr) \u2208 [0, 1) is the unique solution of the equation\nm = (1\u2212 \u03b7+\u03b7\u2212)\u03c6(m). (4)\nProposition 4 implies that for any fixed xr, the battery operator must buy the amount xb = g(xr) of power in order to meet the expected state-of-charge target. One can interpret g(0) as the amount of power needed to meet the target in the absence of frequency regulation. Accordingly, g(xr)\u2212g(0) reflects the amount of power needed to compensate the charging and discharging losses due to frequency regulation. These losses vanish for xr = 0 and increase in xr at a rate that is smaller than or equal to m. The asymptotic slope m is of particular interest because it is an upper bound\non the percentage of regulation power that the battery operator needs to purchase in order to cover the losses from providing frequency regulation.\nLemma 2 (Asymptotic slope). The asymptotic slope m is convex and nonincreasing in the roundtrip efficiency \u03b7+\u03b7\u2212 and nondecreasing in the mean absolute deviation \u2206 of the frequency deviations.\nProposition 4 further reveals that g\u2032+(0) = 0 whenever y0 \u0338= y\u22c6. Otherwise, we have g\u2032+(0) = m.\nLemma 3 (Linearity). If y0 = y\u22c6, then the function g is linear with slope m.\nIf y0 = y\u22c6, the losses increase exactly at rate m. Maybe surprisingly, the losses are thus smaller\nwhen the initial state-of-charge differs from the target.\nRemark 2 (Computability). For any fixed xr, the implicit function g can be evaluated as follows. If xr = 0, then y\u0307(g(0), 0) = y\u0307\u22c6 readily implies that g(0) = 1 \u03b7+\n[y\u0307\u22c6]+ \u2212 \u03b7\u2212[y\u0307\u22c6]\u2212. If xr > 0, we first compute m as the unique solution to equation (4) by bisection on [0, 1]. Next, we compute g(xr) as the unique root of the function y\u0307(g(xr), xr) \u2212 y\u0307\u22c6 on the interval [g(0), g(0) + mxr], again by bisection. Once xb = g(xr) is known, we obtain g\u2032(xr) from equation (3). \u25a1\nUsing Propositions 2 and 4, we can now reformulate problem (R) as the one-dimensional deter-\nministic optimization problem\nmin xr\u2208R+\nT ( cbg(xr)\u2212 crxr ) s.t. xr + g(xr) \u2264 y\u0304+\nxr \u2212 g(xr) \u2264 y\u0304\u2212 xr +max { T\n\u03b3 g(xr), g(xr)\n} \u2264 y\u0304 \u2212 y0\n\u03b7+\u03b3 xr \u2212min { T\n\u03b3 g(xr), g(xr)\n} \u2264 \u03b7\n\u2212y0 \u03b3 .\n(P)\nTheorem 1 (Constraint and dimensionality reduction). The problems (R) and (P) are equivalent.\nNote that the objective function of problem (P) is convex as the implicit function g is convex. The\nfeasible set of (P) can be represented concisely as X = {xr \u2208 R+ : \u2113(xr) \u2264 g(xr) \u2264 u(xr)}, where\n\u2113(xr) = max { xr \u2212min { y\u0304\u2212,\n\u03b7\u2212y0 \u03b3\n} , \u03b3\nT xr \u2212 \u03b7 \u2212y0 T } and\nu(xr) = min { min { y\u0304+,\ny\u0304 \u2212 y0 \u03b7+\u03b3\n} \u2212 xr, y\u0304 \u2212 y0\n\u03b7+T \u2212 \u03b3 T xr } .\nDue to the lower bounds on the convex function g(xr), the set X is nonconvex in general. However, if g(xr)\u2212 \u2113(xr) is monotonic, then there exists at most one intersection between \u2113 and g, which means that the constraint \u2113(xr) \u2264 g(xr) defines nevertheless a convex feasible set. This is the case under the following assumption.\nAssumption 2 (Roundtrip efficiency). We have \u03b7+\u03b7\u2212 > 13 .\nAssumption 2 is non-restrictive. Indeed, all relevant electricity storage technologies, as identified\nby the World Energy Council (2020), have a roundtrip efficiency higher than 13 .\nLemma 4 (Convex feasible set). If Assumption 2 holds, then the set X is convex.\nLemma 4 asserts that the feasible set X is a line segment under realistic parameter settings. As the objective function of problem (P) is convex, an optimal solution xr\u2217 coincides either with a boundary point of the line segment X or with a stationary point of the objective function in the interior of the line segment. All three candidate solutions can be computed conveniently via bisection. If Assumption 2 fails to hold, then X consists of two disjoint line segments, and it becomes necessary to check five different candidate solutions, all of which can be computed by bisection. A detailed discussion of this generalized setting is omitted because it has little practical relevance."

The line segment X is thus non-empty if and only if u(0)\u2212 g(0) \u2265 0 and g(0)\u2212 \u2113(0) \u2265 0. In this case, there exists a unique xru such that u(xru) = g(xru) and a unique xr\u2113 such that g(xr\u2113) = \u2113(x r \u2113). The line segment X is thus given by {xr \u2208 R+ : xr \u2264 xr\u2113 , xr \u2264 xru} = [0, x\u0304r], where x\u0304r = min{xr\u2113 , xru}. At least one of the points xr\u2113 and xru will be in [0, x\u0304r], where x\u0304r is the unique intersection between the strictly increasing lower bound \u2113 and the strictly decreasing upper\nbound u, and can be computed by bisection.

The set of all stationary points in X is thus X\u22c6 = {xr \u2208 [0, x\u0304r] : cr\ncb \u2208 \u2202g(xr)}, where \u2202g(xr) denotes the subdifferential of g at xr. Note that cr cb > 0 because cb > 0 and cr > 0. If x\u0304r = 0, then 0 is the only feasible solution to problem (P). If g\u2032\u2212(x\u0304r) < cr cb , then X\u22c6 is empty, and x\u0304r is the optimal solution to problem (P) because the marginal revenue of providing frequency regulation is strictly higher than the marginal cost for all feasible xr. Similarly, if g\u2032+(0) > cr cb , then X\u22c6 is again empty, and 0 is the optimal solution because the marginal cost of providing frequency regulation is strictly higher than the marginal revenue for all xr \u2208 (0,\u221e]. Otherwise, X\u22c6 is non-empty and may contain several stationary points, all of which are optimal solutions to problem (P). In this case, we assume that the battery operator selects the smallest stationary point to avoid unnecessary battery usage. Theorem 2 formalizes these results.\nTheorem 2. For x\u0304r \u2265 0, the smallest optimal solution to problem (P) is\nxr\u2217 =  0 if x\u0304r = 0 or x\u0304r > 0 and g\u2032+(0) \u2265 c r cb , x\u0304r if x\u0304r > 0 and g\u2032\u2212(x\u0304r) < cr cb ,\nminX\u22c6 otherwise.\nRemark 3. If y\u0307\u22c6 = 0, then g(xr) = mxr. Therefore, xr\u2217 = x\u0304r if m < cr cb and xr\u2217 = 0 otherwise. \u25a1 Remark 4. If X\u22c6 is non-empty, minX\u22c6 can be found by bisection on X as g\u2032 is nondecreasing. \u25a1\nTo compute the optimal solution xr\u2217, we first compute x\u0304r. If x\u0304r > 0, then we evaluate g\u2032(0) and min \u2202g(x\u0304r). By Proposition 4 and Lemma 3, we find g\u2032(0) = 0 if y\u0307\u22c6 \u0338= 0; = m otherwise. Finally, if X\u22c6 is non-empty, we compute its minimum. Since x\u0304r, g\u2032\u2212(x\u0304r), and minX\u22c6 can all be computed by bisection, the optimal solution xr\u2217 can also be computed highly efficiently by bisection.\nThe expected marginal cost of providing frequency regulation depends on the desired charging rate y\u0307\u22c6, which is only known to the battery operator but unknown to the grid operator. Nevertheless,\nthe grid operator knows that the expected marginal cost amounts to at most cbm and can therefore infer that it is profitable for the battery operator to offer all available regulation power if c r\ncb > m.\nThanks to Lemma 2, we know that m is convex and nonincreasing in the roundtrip efficiency \u03b7+\u03b7\u2212 and nondecreasing in the mean absolute deviation \u2206 of the frequency deviations, but we do not know the explicit dependence of m on \u03b7+\u03b7\u2212 and \u2206. In the next section, we will derive explicit lower and upper bounds on m that are tight for certain degenerate frequency deviation distributions. For these particular distributions, we will then derive analytical solutions to problem (P)."

We have \u00af g(xr) \u2264 g(xr) \u2264 g\u0304(xr) for all xr \u2208 R+ and m \u2264 m \u2264 m.\nIn order to calculate the optimal solution xr\u2217 under \u00af P\u03be and P\u0304\u03be, we need to compute the smallest stationary points, if they exist, as well as the boundary points of the feasible sets X\u0304 and X\u0304 . If they exist, the smallest stationary points occur either at kinks of the piecewise linear objective functions cb \u00af g(xr) \u2212 crxr and cbg\u0304(xr) \u2212 crxr or at xr = 0 because \u00af g and g\u0304 are piecewise linear. The left boundary points of both feasible sets are 0, as under P\u03be. The right boundary points are min{ \u00af xr\u2113 , x\u0304 r u} and min{x\u0304r\u2113 , \u00afx r u}, respectively, where \u00afx r \u2113 , x\u0304 r u, x\u0304r\u2113 , and \u00af xru are the unique points with \u00af g( \u00af xr\u2113) = \u2113(\u00af xr\u2113), \u00af g(x\u0304ru) = u(x\u0304 r u), g\u0304(x\u0304r\u2113) = \u2113(x\u0304 r \u2113), and g\u0304(\u00af xru) = u(\u00af xru). The points \u00af xr\u2113 , x\u0304 r u, x\u0304r\u2113 , and \u00af xru can be computed in closed form by evaluating the intersections of the affine functions \u2113 and u with the affine functions that generate \u00af g and g\u0304. The right boundary points min{ \u00af xr\u2113 , x\u0304 r u} and min{x\u0304r\u2113 , \u00afx r u} are then given by the minimum of six and eight rational functions of the problem parameters y0, y\u0307\u22c6, y\u0304, y\u0304+, y\u0304\u2212, \u03b7+, \u03b7\u2212, \u2206, \u03b3, and T , respectively. We omit the closed-form expressions because they are too cumbersome to be insightful in general.\nIn order to derive insightful solutions, we assume that y0 = y\u22c6 in the subsequent analysis. In this special case, the losses due to frequency regulation are higher than for any other value of y0 as explained in the discussion after Proposition 4. If it is profitable to provide frequency regulation in this special case, it will thus also be profitable to provide frequency regulation in any other case. As y\u0307\u22c6 = y \u22c6\u2212y0 T = 0, Lemma 3 implies that\n\u00af g(xr) = mxr, g(xr) = mxr, and g\u0304(xr) = mxr. Under any\nfrequency deviation distribution P\u03be, the optimal solution to problem (P) then satisfies xr\u2217 = x\u0304r if m < c r\ncb and xr\u2217 = 0 otherwise. Since \u2113 and u are piecewise linear functions with two pieces each, the\nright boundary point x\u0304r of the feasible set can be expressed as the minimum of only four rational functions of the problem parameters, and will admit an intuitive interpretation.\nProposition 5. If y0 = y\u22c6, then\nx\u0304r = min\n{ y\u0304\u2212\n1\u2212m, y\u0304+ 1 +m , \u03b7\u2212y0 \u03b3(1\u2212m) , y\u0304 \u2212 y0 \u03b7+(\u03b3 +mT )\n} . (5)\nThe first two terms in formula (5) for xr depend on the charging capacity y\u0304+ and the discharging capacity y\u0304\u2212, while the last two terms depend on the battery capacity y\u0304 and the initial state-ofcharge y0. We say that the battery is power-constrained if x\u0304r is equal to one of the first two terms. Otherwise, we say that the battery is energy-constrained. We now state the analytical solution.\nTheorem 3 (Analytical solution). If y0 = y\u22c6, then an optimal solution to problem (P) is\nxr\u2217 =  0 if m \u2265 cr cb ,\nx\u0304r otherwise,\nunder any frequency deviation distribution P\u03be. If P\u03be = \u00af P\u03be, then m = m. If P\u03be = P\u0304\u03be, then m = m.\nAs a direct consequence of Theorem 3, if m < c r\ncb , it is optimal to set xr = x\u0304r for any frequency\ndeviation distribution with mean absolute deviation \u2206, regardless of the shape of the distribution, because m \u2265 m. In the following, we describe the maximum amount x\u0304r of regulation power that can be offered by power- and energy-constrained batteries for the case y0 = y\u22c6.\nIf the battery is power-constrained, then x\u0304r depends on the charging and discharging efficiencies only through the marginal increase m in the expected power loss which, in turn, depends on these efficiencies only through the roundtrip efficiency \u03b7+\u03b7\u2212. Due to charging and discharging losses, the battery operator expects to lose energy while delivering frequency regulation and compensates the expected loss by purchasing the power mxr from an electricity market, which decreases the effective charging capacity and increases the effective discharging capacity of the battery. Accounting for the effective charging and discharging capacities, the battery operator may dimension the discharging capacity y\u0304\u2212 as a fraction 1\u2212m1+m of the charging capacity y\u0304 + without restricting x\u0304r.\nIf the battery is energy-constrained, then x\u0304r depends not only on the roundtrip efficiency \u03b7+\u03b7\u2212, through m, but also on the individual charging and discharging efficiencies. Charging losses increase the amount of energy that the battery can consume from the grid and therefore increase the effective storage capacity. Conversely, discharging losses decrease the amount of energy that the battery can deliver to the grid and therefore decrease the effective storage capacity. For given charging and discharging efficiencies, the initial state-of-charge y0 determines how much energy the battery can consume from and deliver to the grid. As the battery operator must be able to both consume and deliver regulation power, x\u0304r is maximized if the battery can absorb as much energy from the grid as it can deliver to the grid. This occurs at an initial state-of-charge of y\u22c60 and results in the maximum amount x\u0304r\u22c6 of regulation power that can be offered by energy-constrained batteries, where\nx\u0304r\u22c6 = min\n{ y\u0304\u2212\n1\u2212m, y\u0304+ 1 +m ,\n\u03b7\u2212\n\u03b3 T (1 + \u03b7\n+\u03b7\u2212 \u2212m) + \u03b7+\u03b7\u2212m y\u0304 T\n} and y\u22c60 =\n(1\u2212m)y\u0304 1 + \u03b7+\u03b7\u2212 + (\u03b7+\u03b7\u2212 T\u03b3 \u2212 1)m .\nAssuming that y\u0304\u2212 = 1\u2212m1+m y\u0304 +, the battery is thus energy constrained if y\u0304\n+\n1+m > x\u0304 r \u22c6, which occurs if\nthe battery\u2019s charge rate C = y\u0304 +\ny (C-rate) is no smaller than\nC = 1 T \u00b7 (1 +m)\u03b7\n\u2212\n\u03b3 T (1 + \u03b7\n+\u03b7\u2212 \u2212m) + \u03b7+\u03b7\u2212m.\nThe C-rate expresses the percentage of the battery\u2019s storage capacity that can be consumed from the grid within one hour.\nThe initial state-of-charge y\u22c60, which maximizes the amount of regulation power that energyconstrained batteries can provide, depends on the charging and discharging efficiencies only through the roundtrip efficiency \u03b7+\u03b7\u2212. It increases from y\u03042 to y\u0304 as the roundtrip efficiency decreases from 1 to 0. The maximum amount x\u0304r\u22c6 of regulation power that can be provided by energy-constrained batteries is equal to y\u03042\u03b3 in the absence of charging and discharging losses. The storage capacity y\u0304 is divided by 2\u03b3 because the battery operator must be able to both consume and deliver all of the regulation power she promised for a total time of at least \u03b3."

Since frequency 1https://clients.rte-france.com\nregulation is traded up to one day before delivery, we use the prices of the day-ahead market, which are equal to the delivery prices published by RTE (R\u00e9seau de transport d\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9, 2017, p. 68). Retail market prices vary from one electric utility company to another. We use the base tariff of Electricit\u00e9 de France, the largest French electric utility company. The French government regulates this particular tariff and publishes the corresponding prices.2 We will compare the operating costs of storage technologies with different roundtrip efficiencies, namely hydrogen, redox flow batteries, vehicle-to-grid, pumped hydro, and stationary lithium-ion batteries. In assigning roundtrip efficiencies to storage technologies, we follow Apostolaki-Iosifidou et al. (2017) for vehicle-to-grid and the World Energy Council (World Energy Council, 2020, p. 9) for all other storage technologies. Table 1 lists the roundtrip efficiencies of the storage technologies. In order to judge whether it is profitable to invest in lithium-ion batteries for frequency regulation, we follow Comello and Reichelstein (2019) and assume that investment costs in the year 2023 range from US$85 to US$165 per kWh of storage capacity with a lifetime of 10 years and from US$710 to US$860 per kW of charging and discharging capacity with a lifetime of 30 years. We assume an exchange rate of 1e = US$1.15 and annualize the investment costs with a yearly discount rate of 2%, which equals the long-term inflation target of the European Central Bank (2021). We use 2019 electricity prices, i.e., before the drop in prices during the Covid pandemic and the rise in prices since the war in Ukraine and the maintenance problems in the French nuclear power plant fleet. Based on these prices, we set the ratio cr cb of the expected average price of regulation power to the expected market price of electricity to 0.251 for wholesale market prices and to 0.059 for retail market prices. In terms of frequency regulation, we consider the common European market for frequency containment reserves, which has a daily planning horizon and thus set T = 24 hours. We approximate the cumulative distribution function corresponding to P\u03be by the symmetric logistic function F (\u03be) = 11+exp(\u2212\u03b8\u03be) with \u03b8 = 2 ln(2)\u2206 and mean absolute deviation \u2206 = 0.0816.

Figure 2 displays m as a function of the roundtrip efficiency for the estimated logistic distribution of frequency deviations, together with its lower bound m and its upper bound m, both parametrized to have the same mean absolute deviation as the logistic distribution. The bounds are tight when the roundtrip efficiency equals one and loosen as the roundtrip efficiency decreases. The upper bound loosens faster than the lower bound. For roundtrip efficiencies higher than 0.60, the lower bound, m = 1\u2212\u03b7 +\u03b7\u2212\n1+\u03b7+\u03b7\u2212\u2206, underestimates m by less than 4.59 \u00b7 10\u22124. At a roundtrip efficiency of 0.35, typical for inefficient hydrogen storage, m equals 4.30%. For inefficient redox flow batteries, with a roundtrip efficiency of 0.60, m decreases to 2.09%. For inefficient lithium-ion batteries, with a roundtrip efficiency of 0.85, m decreases further to 0.66%. Unsurprisingly, m vanishes for perfectly efficient storage devices. For storage operators buying electricity at retail prices, the ratio c r\ncb was\ngreater than 0.026 on all days in 2019. It would have therefore been profitable for them to use any of the storage technologies we consider at their full potential for frequency regulation, except for hydrogen storage. For storage operators buying electricity at wholesale prices, the ratio c r\ncb was\ngreater than 0.07 on all days in 2019, which means that it would have been profitable for them to use a hydrogen storage device at its full potential, too.\nAlthough charging and discharging losses may not cause storage operators to withhold regulation power from the market, they still reduce the profit cr \u2212mcb per unit of regulation power. Figure 3 shows the average profit per unit of regulation power as a function of roundtrip efficiency for storage operators buying electricity at wholesale and retail prices in the year 2019. Losses reduce the profit\nby 19% from 0.90 ctskW\u00b7h to 0.73 cts kW\u00b7h for the most inefficient storage devices if electricity is bought at wholesale prices. If electricity is bought at retail prices, losses reduce the profit by 72% to 0.24 ctskW\u00b7h . The reduction is four times higher at retail than at wholesale prices. A hydrogen tank with \u03b7\u2212\u03b7+ = 0.4 buying electricity at wholesale prices and an electric vehicle with \u03b7\u2212\u03b7+ = 0.8 buying electricity at retail prices achieve the same profit per unit of regulation power.\nLosses reduce not only the profit per unit of regulation power, but may also impact the amount of regulation power x\u0304r a storage device can provide. If the storage device is energy-constrained, then charging losses increase the amount of energy that the storage device can consume from the grid, while discharging losses decrease the amount of energy that the storage device can deliver to the grid. In principle, charging losses may outweigh discharging losses and increase the normalized regulation bid compared to storage devices with no losses. In practice, however, discharging losses usually outweigh charging losses. As examples, we consider lithium-ion batteries, vehicle-to-grid,\nand hydrogen storage, all of them operating at an activation ratio of 0.2. Hydrogen storage is unlikely to be energy-constrained because hydrogen can be stored at low cost in steel tanks, or at even lower cost in salt caverns (Victoria et al., 2019). Nevertheless, we include hydrogen in our comparison as an example of storage devices with low roundtrip efficiencies. For lithium-ion batteries with charging and discharging efficiencies of 0.92 each, losses reduce the normalized regulation bid from 1 to 0.98. For vehicle-to-grid with a charging efficiency of 0.88 and a discharging efficiency of 0.79, loosely based on Apostolaki-Iosifidou et al. (2017), losses reduce the normalized regulation bid to 0.91. For hydrogen storage with a charging efficiency of 0.80 and a discharging efficiency of 0.58, based on Victoria et al. (2019), losses reduce the normalized regulation bid to 0.77. For more details on the impact of charging and discharging losses on x\u0304r, see SM B.2.1."

            "text": "We will now analyze the profit that an energy-constrained storage device may earn per unit of storage capacity. First, we describe the operating profit made over the planning horizon of length T . For lithium-ion batteries, we then calculate the effective yearly profit as the difference between the operating profits made over one year and the annualized investments costs of the battery.\nThe operating profit is the product of the profit per unit of regulation power and the amount\nof regulation power the storage device can deliver. Formally, the operating profit is thus equal to\n(cr \u2212mcb) \u00b7 \u03b7 \u2212y\u0304\n\u03b3 T (1 + \u03b7\n+\u03b7\u2212 \u2212m) + \u03b7+\u03b7\u2212m.\nIt may be somewhat surprising that the operating profit depends on the length of the planning horizon T only through the activation ratio \u03b3/T . Intuitively, one may expect the operating profit to increase linearly with the length of the planning horizon because a longer planning horizon should allow the storage operator to sell the same amount of regulation power for a longer period of time. This reasoning is correct if the storage device is power-constrained. For energy-constrained storage devices, however, the storage operator can only deliver a fixed amount of regulation energy. The length of the planning horizon does therefore not influence the operating profit. Figure 4 summarizes the impact of losses on the profits per unit of regulation power, on the maximum normalized regulation power, and on operating profits at wholesale and retail electricity prices for the lithiumion battery, vehicle-to-grid, and hydrogen storage examples that we considered earlier. SM B.2.2 explains in detail how operating profits depends on the charging and discharging efficiencies.\nThe effective yearly profit determines whether it is worthwhile for a storage operator to invest into storage devices for frequency regulation. Based on the cost and lifetime data of lithium-ion batteries in Section 6.1, we estimate the annualized costs of lithium-ion batteries in the year 2023 to range from 8.2 ekWh to 16.0 e kWh for energy storage capacity and from 27.6 e kW to 33.4 e kW for charging and discharging capacity. Figure 5 shows the effective yearly profit for lithium-ion batteries with charging and discharging efficiencies of 0.92, buying electricity at wholesale prices, as a function of the length of the planning horizon, for activation ratios of 0.1 and 0.2, for low annualized investment costs of 8.2 ekWh and 27.6 e kW , and for high annualized investment costs of 16.0 e kWh and 33.4 e kW . At the current 24 hour planning horizon, lithium-ion batteries are profitable only at an activation ratio of 0.1 and low investment costs. Given that we only considered the cost of the battery itself but no additional costs related to installation, maintenance, administration, or land lease, investing in lithium-ion batteries for frequency regulation does not seem to be profitable in the near future. In the medium term, lithium-ion batteries may become sufficiently low-cost (Ziegler and Trancik, 2021) to be used for frequency regulation. Besides falling battery prices, grid operators might opt for an activation ratio of 0.1 rather than 0.2 to make the use of energy storage for frequency regulation more profitable. This would roughly double the operating profits from frequency regulation, but it would also shrink the uncertainty set D and therefore make grid operators more vulnerable to extreme frequency deviations that could cause black-outs.\nAlternatively, grid operators could reduce the length of the planning horizon T . If the planning horizon were to be reduced from 24 hours to 4 hours, for example, the operating profits accrued over a one-year period would increase by a factor 6. Similarly, the minimum C-rate required for the battery to be energy-constrained and thus the costs for charging and discharging capacity would\nalso increase by a factor 6. The increase in operating profits is well worth the increased charger costs. Under the reduced planning horizon, lithium-ion batteries could achieve an effective yearly profit of 10e per kWh of storage capacity, even at high investment costs and high activation ratios. A shorter planning horizon for frequency regulation does not necessarily make grid operators more vulnerable to extreme frequency deviations and is already common practice in intraday wholesale electricity markets.3 Adopting intraday markets for frequency regulation as well would make energyconstrained storage devices more competitive with power-constrained flexibility providers, such as thermal power plants and pumped hydro storage. The increased competition may decrease the total cost of frequency regulation, which is ultimately borne by the public."

            "text": "The European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas and Electricity (2022) estimates that they will need to store electricity in batteries with a total power of up to 240GW by the year 2050. Lithium-ion batteries are considered a promising source of frequency regulation, thanks to their fast dynamics. The investment costs of lithium-ion batteries have declined sharply in recent years, but we find that they are not yet low enough for lithium-ion batteries to be profitable in the frequency regulation market. Since Europe plans to increasingly rely on batteries in the future, their use should become profitable.\nWe identify two policy options that make electricity storage in general and battery storage 3https://www.entsoe.eu/network_codes/cacm/implementation/sidc/\nin particular more profitable in the frequency regulation market. First, regulators can decrease the marginal costs of frequency regulation by making it easier for small and medium-sized storage devices to access wholesale electricity markets. This is one of the aims of Order 845 by the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (2018). Second, regulators can decrease the length of the planning horizon, which is currently one day in the common European frequency regulation market. We show that the amount of regulation power that storage devices can provide may be constrained by their storage capacity and their initial state-of-charge. In this case, the profits from frequency regulation over the lifetime of the storage devices are inversely proportional to the length of the planning horizon. The planning horizon could be shortened by adopting intraday markets for frequency regulation, which already exist for the wholesale of electricity.\nAcknowledgements D.L. thanks Emilia Suomalainen, Ja\u00e2far Berrada, Fran\u00e7ois Colet, Willett Kempton, and Yannick Perez for helpful discussions, and the Institut Vedecom for funding."

            "text": "This appendix contains the proofs of all essential theorems, propositions, and lemmas in the main text. All other proofs are relegated to the supplementary material.\nThe proof of Proposition 2 relies on the following lemma, which involves the set D\u2193 of all nonincreasing left-continuous functions in D.\nLemma 7. For any xr \u2265 0, we have\nmax \u03b4\u2208D, t\u2208T y(xb, xr, \u03b4, y0, t) = max \u03b4\u2208D+\u2193 , t\u2208T y(xb, xr, \u03b4, y0, t). (6)\nProof of Proposition 2. We first show that the upper bound on the charging power and the upper bound on the state-of-charge are valid for all frequency deviation trajectories \u03b4 \u2208 D and all time instants t \u2208 T if and only if they are valid for the particular frequency deviation trajectory \u03b4(+), defined through \u03b4(+)(t) = 1 if t \u2264 \u03b3 and \u03b4(+) = 0 otherwise, and both time instants t \u2208 {\u03b3, T}.\nThe upper bound on the charging power is valid for all \u03b4 \u2208 D and all t \u2208 T if and only if it is valid for the maximum charging power that can be achieved by any \u03b4 \u2208 D and any t \u2208 T . We have\nmax \u03b4\u2208D, t\u2208T y+(xb, xr, \u03b4(t)) = max \u03b4\u2208D+, t\u2208T y+(xb, xr, \u03b4(t)) = max \u03b4\u2208D+, t\u2208T xb + \u03b4(t)xr = xb + xr,\nwhere the first equality holds because y+ is nondecreasing in \u03b4(t) and because D is symmetric. In fact, for any \u03b4 \u2208 D, we have |\u03b4| \u2208 D, and the maximum charging power for |\u03b4| is at least as high as the one for \u03b4. The second equaliy holds because y+ is linear in \u03b4(t) whenever \u03b4(t) \u2265 0. The last equality holds because \u03b4(t) \u2264 1 for all \u03b4 \u2208 D+ and t \u2208 T , and because the upper bound is attained at \u03b4 = \u03b4(+) and t = \u03b3, for example. Thus, assertion (i) follows.\nFor the upper bound on the state-of-charge, we first use Lemma (7) to obtain\nmax \u03b4\u2208D, t\u2208T y(xb, xr, \u03b4, y0, t) = max \u03b4\u2208D+\u2193 , t\u2208T y(xb, xr, \u03b4, y0, t).\nIf xb+xr < 0, then the battery is discharging for all t \u2208 T . The upper bound on the state-of-charge is thus valid if y0 \u2264 y\u0304, which we stated as a condition in Proposition 2.\nOtherwise, if xb + xr \u2265 0, one can show that\nmax \u03b4\u2208D+\u2193 , t\u2208T\ny(xb, xr, \u03b4, y0, t) =  max tc,\u03b4c y0 + t c\u03b7+(xb + \u03b4cxr) s.t. xb + \u03b4cxr \u2265 0, tc\u03b4c \u2264 \u03b3, 0 \u2264 \u03b4c \u2264 1, 0 \u2264 tc \u2264 T. (7)\nTo this end, we first show that any feasible solution to the maximization problem on the left-hand side of (7) gives rise to a feasible solution to the maximization problem on the right-hand side with the same or a larger objective value. For any \u03b4 \u2208 D+\u2193 and t \u2208 T , we construct the last time at which the battery is still charged as tc = maxt\u2032\u2208[0,t]{t\u2032 : xb + \u03b4(t\u2032)xr \u2265 0}, which exists because \u03b4 is left-continuous nonincreasing and hence upper semi-continuous. We also construct the\naverage frequency deviation signal during the charging process as \u03b4c = 1tc \u222b tc 0 \u03b4(t \u2032) dt\u2032, which satisfies xb+ \u03b4cxr \u2265 0 because xb+ \u03b4(t\u2032)xr \u2265 0 for all t \u2264 tc because \u03b4 is nonincreasing. As \u03b4 \u2208 D+\u2193 , we have tc\u03b4c = \u222b tc 0 \u03b4(t \u2032) dt\u2032 \u2264 \u222b T \u03b4(t\n\u2032) dt\u2032 \u2264 \u03b3. In addition, we have 0 \u2264 tc \u2264 T as t \u2208 T and 0 \u2264 \u03b4c \u2264 1 as \u03b4 \u2208 D+\u2193 . Since the state-of-charge y is nondecreasing in \u03b4, which is nonincreasing in time, we have\ny(xb, xr, \u03b4, y0, t) \u2264 y(xb, xr, \u03b4, y0, tc) = \u222b tc 0 y0 + \u03b7 +(xb + \u03b4(t\u2032)xr) dt\u2032 = y0 + tc\u03b7+(xb + \u03b4cxr), (8)\nwhere the second equality holds because \u03b4 is integrated against a constant function and can thus be set to its average value \u03b4c over the integration horizon.\nGiven a feasible solution (tc, \u03b4c) to the maximization problem on the right-hand side of (7), we can also construct a feasible solution to the left-hand side with the same objective value by setting t = tc and \u03b4(t\u2032) = \u03b4c if t\u2032 \u2264 tc and = 0 otherwise. It is clear that t \u2208 T since 0 \u2264 tc \u2264 T . In addition, \u03b4 is nonnegative and left-continuous nonincreasing as 0 \u2264 \u03b4c \u2264 1. Finally, \u222b T \u03b4(t \u2032) dt\u2032 = tc\u03b4c \u2264 \u03b3 ensures that \u03b4 \u2208 D+\u2193 . The construction satisfies again tc = maxt\u2032\u2208[0,t]{t\u2032 : xb + \u03b4(t\u2032)xr \u2265 0} and \u03b4c = 1tc \u222b tc 0 \u03b4(t \u2032) dt\u2032. The equality of the objective values thus follows from (8).\nIn summary, we have shown that the two problems in (7) have indeed the same maximum. The objective function of the right-hand side problem in (7) is nondecreasing in \u03b4c and tc since \u03b7+ \u2265 0, xr \u2265 0, and xb + \u03b4cxr \u2265 0. It is thus optimal to make \u03b4ctc as large as possible, i.e., setting it to \u03b3, because the box constraints on \u03b4c and tc only imply a weaker upper bound of T \u2265 \u03b3 on tc\u03b4c.\nBy substituting \u03b4c = \u03b3/tc we arrive at the equality\nmax tc,\u03b4c\ny0 + t c\u03b7+(xb + \u03b4cxr)\ns.t. xb + \u03b4cxr \u2265 0, tc\u03b4c = \u03b3, 0 \u2264 \u03b4c \u2264 1, 0 \u2264 tc \u2264 T\n =  max tc y0 + \u03b7 +(tcxb + \u03b3xr) s.t. tcxb + \u03b3xr \u2265 0, \u03b3 \u2264 tc \u2264 T. (9)\nWe will now analyze the one-dimensional linear program on the right-hand side of (9). If xb \u2265 0, then the inequality tcxb + \u03b3xr \u2265 0 is always valid and it is optimal to make tc as large as possible, i.e., setting it to T . Conversely, if xb < 0, then it is optimal to make tc as small as possible, i.e., setting it to \u03b3. In this case tc satisfies again the inequality tcxb + \u03b3xr \u2265 0 because xb + xr \u2265 0. Combining all of the above arguments, we thus obtain\nmax \u03b4\u2208D, t\u2208T\ny(xb, xr, \u03b4, y0, t) = y0 + \u03b7 + ( max{\u03b3xb, Txb}+ \u03b3xr ) ,\nleading to assertion (iii). One easily verifies that \u03b4(+) attains the maximum on the left-hand side.\nUsing similar arguments, one can show that the upper bound on the discharging power and the lower bound on the state-of-charge hold for all frequency deviation signals \u03b4 \u2208 D and all time instants t \u2208 T if and only if they hold for the particular frequency deviation signal \u03b4(\u2212) = \u2212\u03b4(+) and all time instants t \u2208 {\u03b3, T}. We omit the details for the sake of brevity.\nThe proof of Proposition 3 relies on the following symmetry property of \u03c6.\nLemma 8 (Symmetry of \u03c6). For all z \u2208 R, we have \u03c6(z) = \u03c6(\u2212z) + z.\nProof of Proposition 3. We first prove equation (2) for xr > 0. We have\nE [ y(xb, xr, \u03b4\u0303, y0, T ) ] = y0 + T E [ 1\nT \u222b T \u03b7+ [ xb + \u03b4\u0303(t)xr ]+ \u2212 1 \u03b7\u2212 [ xb + \u03b4\u0303(t)xr ]\u2212 dt ] = y0 + Tx r \u222b 1 \u22121 \u03b7+ [ xb xr + \u03be ]+ \u2212 1 \u03b7\u2212 [ xb xr + \u03be ]\u2212 P\u03be(d\u03be), (10)\nwhere the second equality follows from the definition of P\u03be. Setting z = xb/xr to simplify notation, we find \u222b 1 \u22121 [z + \u03be]+ P\u03be(d\u03be) = \u222b 1 \u2212z (z + \u03be)P\u03be(d\u03be) = zF (\u03be)|1\u2212z + \u03beF (\u03be)|1\u2212z \u2212 \u222b 1 \u2212z F (\u03be) d\u03be\n= (z + 1)F (1) + \u03c6(\u2212z)\u2212 \u03c6(1) = z + \u03c6(\u2212z).\nThe second equality follows from integration by parts, whereas the fourth equality holds because F (1) = \u03c6(1) = 1. In fact, as \u03c6(\u22121) = 0 by construction, Lemma 8 implies that \u03c6(1) = \u03c6(\u22121)+1 = 1. Following a similar reasoning and keeping in mind that F (\u22121) = 0, we obtain\u222b 1\n\u22121 [z + \u03be]\u2212 P\u03be(d\u03be) = \u2212 \u222b \u2212z \u22121 (z + \u03be)P\u03be(d\u03be) = (z \u2212 1)F (\u22121) + \u03c6(\u2212z)\u2212 \u03c6(\u22121) = \u03c6(\u2212z).\nSubstituting these expressions into (10) yields equation (2).\nFor xr = 0, the expectation E[y(xb, 0, \u03b4\u0303, y0, T )] is trivially equal to y0 + T (\u03b7+[xb]+ \u2212 1\u03b7\u2212 [xb]\u2212), which corresponds to the formula given in Proposition 3 thanks to the definition of the perspective function. In fact,\nlim xr\u21920+\nxr\u03c6 ( \u2212x b\nxr\n) = xb ( lim\nxr\u21920+ \u2202 \u2202xb xr\u03c6\n( \u2212x b\nxr\n)) = xb ( lim\nxr\u21920+ \u2212F\n( \u2212x b\nxr\n)) = [ xb ]\u2212 .\nWe now establish several useful properties of the expected terminal state-of-charge. Note first that \u03c6 is convex, Lipschitz continuous, and almost everywhere differentiable because it is a supercumulative distribution function. The expected terminal state-of-charge is jointly concave in xb and xr because \u2212xr\u03c6(\u2212xbxr ) is the negative perspective of the convex function \u03c6(\u2212xb) and therefore concave (Boyd and Vandenberghe, 2004, p. 89). As a perspective of a Lipschitz continuous convex function, the expected terminal state-of-charge is also globally continuous. To see that the expected terminal state-of-charge is strictly increasing in xb for every xr > 0, note that\n\u2202 \u2202xb E [ y(xb, xr, \u03b4\u0303, y0, T ) ] = T ( \u03b7+ + \u03b7dF ( \u2212x b xr )) > 0 \u2200(xb, xr) \u2208 R \u00d7 R++\nbecause \u03b7+ > 0, \u03b7d \u2265 0, and F is nonnegative. For xr = 0, E[y(xb, 0, \u03b4\u0303, y0, T )] = y0 + T (\u03b7+[xb]+ \u2212 1 \u03b7\u2212 [x b]\u2212), which is strictly increasing in xb since \u03b7+ > 0 and \u03b7\u2212 > 0.\nSimilarly, to see that the expected terminal state-of-charge is nondecreasing in xr, we note that\n\u2202 \u2202xr E [ y(xb, xr, \u03b4\u0303, y0, T ) ] = \u2212\u03b7dT ( \u03c6 ( \u2212x b xr ) + xb xr F ( \u2212x b xr )) \u2264 0 \u2200(xb, xr) \u2208 R \u00d7 R++.\nTo prove the inequality, we set z = \u2212xb/xr and show that the function \u2212\u03b7d(\u03c6(z) \u2212 zF (z)) is nonnegative. As \u03c6(z) = 0 for all z \u2264 \u22121, Lemma 8 implies that \u03c6(z) = z for all z \u2265 1. Thus, we have \u03c6(z) \u2212 zF (z) = 0 for all |z| \u2265 1. If z \u2208 [\u22121, 0], then \u03c6(z) \u2212 zF (z) \u2265 0 because \u03c6 and F are both nonnegative. Finally, if z \u2208 [0, 1] then we first note that\n\u03c6(1) = \u03c6(z) + \u222b 1 z F (z\u2032) dz\u2032 \u2264 \u03c6(z) + \u222b 1 z F (1) dz\u2032 = \u03c6(z) + F (1)(1\u2212 z). (11)\nHence, we have\n0 = \u03c6(1)\u2212 F (1) \u2264 \u03c6(z) + F (1)(1\u2212 z)\u2212 F (1) = \u03c6(z)\u2212 zF (1) \u2264 \u03c6(z)\u2212 zF (z)\nfor every z \u2208 [0, 1], where the second inequality follows from the monotonicity of F . Finally, the expected terminal state-of-charge is unbounded above in xb because\nlim xb\u2192\u221e y0 + T\n( \u03b7+xb \u2212 \u03b7dxr\u03c6 ( \u2212x b\nxr\n)) = lim\nxb\u2192\u221e y0 + T\u03b7\n+xb = \u221e,\nwhere the first equality holds because \u03c6(\u2212xbxr ) = 0 for all xb \u2265 xr.\nProof of Proposition 4. The average expected charging rate y\u0307 is a positive affine transformation of the expected terminal state-of-charge. Proposition 3 thus immediately implies that y\u0307 is continuous and jointly concave in xb and xr. In addition, y\u0307 is strictly increasing and unbounded above in xb, and nonincreasing in xr. As y\u0307 is concave and strictly increasing in xb, it is also unbounded below in xb. Overall, y\u0307 is continuous and unbounded below and above in xb, which means that the equation y\u0307(xb, xr) = y\u0307\u22c6 has at least one solution xb for any given xr \u2208 R+. As y\u0307 is strictly increasing in xb, this solution is also unique. The constraint y\u0307(xb, xr) = y\u0307\u22c6 defines therefore a unique implicit function g : R+ \u2192 R such that y\u0307(g(xr), xr) = y\u0307\u22c6 for all xr \u2208 R+. As y\u0307(xb, xr) is nonincreasing in xr and strictly increasing in xb, the equality y\u0307(g(xr), xr) = y\u0307\u22c6 remains valid if and only if the implicit function g is nondecreasing.\nAs y\u0307(xb, xr) is concave in xb and xr, the superlevel set C = {(xb, xr) \u2208 R \u00d7 R+ : y\u0307(xb, xr) \u2265 y\u0307\u22c6} is convex. As y\u0307 is strictly increasing in xb, a point (xb, xr) satisfies y\u0307(xb, xr) \u2265 y\u0307\u22c6 if and only if xb \u2265 g(xr). The set C thus coincides with the epigraph of g. The convexity of C then implies that g is a convex function (Boyd and Vandenberghe, 2004, p. 75).\nThe proof of Proposition 3 reveals that the partial derivatives of the expected terminal state of charge with respect to xb and xr exist on R and R++, which implies that the partial derivatives of y\u0307 also exist on R and R++. Since y\u0307 is partially differentiable and continuous, the univariate function g will be continuous and differentiable almost everywhere. By the implicit function theorem (Protter and Morrey, 1985, p. 395), the derivative of g is given by\ng\u2032(xr) = \u2212 \u2202y\u0307(xb, xr) \u2202xr\n\u2202y\u0307(xb, xr) \u2202xb\n= \u03b7d \u03c6(\u2212xbxr ) + x b xrF (\u2212x b xr )\n\u03b7+ + \u03b7dF (\u2212xbxr )\nif it exists. To show that g\u2032(xr) = 0 for every xr \u2208 (0, |g(0)|), assume that g(0) \u0338= 0, and note that\ny\u0307(g(0), |g(0)|) = \u03b7+g(0)\u2212 \u03b7d |g(0)|\u03c6 ( \u2212 g(0)|g(0)| ) = \u03b7+g(0)\u2212 \u03b7d [g(0)]\u2212 = y\u0307(g(0), 0),\nwhere the first and third equalities follow from Proposition 3, and the second equality holds because \u03c6(z) = 0 for z \u2264 \u22121 and \u03c6(z) = z for z \u2265 1. This implies that y\u0307(g(|g(0)|), |g(0)|) = y\u0307(g(0), 0), and thus g(|g(0)|) = g(0). As g is nondecreasing, it must be constant throughout the interval [0, |g(0)|], which means that g\u2032(xr) = 0 for all xr in the interior of that interval.\nNote that the asymptotic slope of g is given by m = limxr\u2192\u221e g\u2032(xr) = limxr\u2192\u221e g(xr) xr because g\nis convex. The limit exists and is bounded below because g is convex. In addition, we have\n0 = lim xr\u2192\u221e\ny\u0307\u22c6 xr = lim xr\u2192\u221e y\u0307(g(xr), xr) xr = lim xr\u2192\u221e \u03b7+ g(xr) xr \u2212 \u03b7d\u03c6\n( \u2212g(x r)\nxr\n) ,\nimplying that limxr\u2192\u221e g(xr) xr < +\u221e as limxr\u2192\u221e \u03c6(\u2212 g(xr) xr ) = 0. Thus, m = limxr\u2192\u221e g(xr) xr is finite, and m is a solution to the equation \u03b7+\u00b5\u2212\u03b7d\u03c6(\u2212\u00b5) = 0. As \u03b7d = 1\u03b7\u2212\u2212\u03b7+ and \u03c6(\u2212m) = \u03c6(m)\u2212m by Lemma 8, this equation is equivalent to m = (1\u2212\u03b7+\u03b7\u2212)\u03c6(m). It admits a unique solution within the interval [0, 1), because the function s(\u00b5) = \u00b5 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b7+\u03b7\u2212)\u03c6(\u00b5) is nondecreasing in \u00b5, nonpositive for \u00b5 = 0, and strictly positive for \u00b5 = 1. The function s is nondecreasing as its derivative 1\u2212 (1\u2212 \u03b7+\u03b7\u2212)F (m) is nonnegative because F (m) \u2264 1 for all m \u2208 R and because \u03b7+\u03b7\u2212 \u2208 (0, 1].\nProof of Lemma 2. We know from Proposition 4 that the asymptotic slope m is the unique solution to the equation s(\u00b5) = 0, where s(\u00b5) = \u00b5\u2212 (1\u2212 \u03b7+\u03b7\u2212)\u03c6(\u00b5). We have s(0) = \u2212(1\u2212 \u03b7+\u03b7\u2212)\u03c6(0) \u2264 0 and s\u2032(\u00b5) = 1\u2212(1\u2212\u03b7+\u03b7\u2212)F (\u00b5). As F (\u00b5) \u2208 [0, 1] for all \u00b5 \u2208 R and as \u03b7+\u03b7\u2212 \u2208 (0, 1], s\u2032 is nonnegative and s is nondecreasing in \u00b5. An increase in \u2206 = 2\u03c6(0) can decrease (but not increase) the intercept s(0), but it does not influence the slope s\u2032. An increase in \u03b7+\u03b7\u2212 can increase (but not decrease) the intercept s(0) and the slope s\u2032. The zero-crossing of s is thus nondecreasing in \u2206 and nonincreasing in \u03b7+\u03b7\u2212, and so is m.\nTo show that m is convex and nonincreasing in the roundtrip efficiency \u03b7+\u03b7\u2212, we first note that\nm = min \u00b5\n{ \u00b5 : \u00b5 \u2265 (1\u2212 \u03b7+\u03b7\u2212)\u03c6(\u00b5) } (12)\nas it is never optimal to set \u00b5 > (1\u2212 \u03b7+\u03b7\u2212)\u03c6(\u00b5) since \u03c6 is nondecreasing and continuous. Next, we characterize \u03c6 as a pointwise supremum of affine functions. As \u03c6 is a continuous convex function, it is closed. By the envelope representation theorem, any closed convex function is the\npointwise supremum of all affine functions below it (Rockafellar, 1970, p. 102). For \u03c6, specifically, we have \u03c6(\u00b5) = 0 for all \u00b5 \u2264 \u22121 and \u03c6(\u00b5) = \u00b5 for all \u00b5 \u2265 1. It thus suffices to consider all affine functions a\u00b5+ b with a \u2265 0 and b \u2265 0 such that \u03c6(\u00b5) \u2265 a\u00b5+ b. The highest possible slope of any such function is the highest possible slope of \u03c6, which is 1. Similarly, the highest possible intercept of any such function is the intercept of \u03c6, which is \u03c6(0). Let A = {(a, b) \u2208 [0, 1]\u00d7 [0, \u03c6(0)] : \u03c6(\u00b5) \u2265 a\u00b5 + b \u2200\u00b5 \u2208 R} be the set of all admissible coefficients for the affine functions. By the envelope representation theorem, we have \u03c6(\u00b5) = max(a,b)\u2208A a\u00b5+ b for all \u00b5 \u2208 R.\nSustituting this expression of \u03c6 into equation (12) yields\nm =min \u00b5\n{ \u00b5 : \u00b5 \u2265 (1\u2212 \u03b7+\u03b7\u2212) max\n(a,b)\u2208A a\u00b5+ b\n} = min\n\u00b5\n{ \u00b5 : \u00b5 \u2265 (1\u2212 \u03b7+\u03b7\u2212)a\u00b5+ b \u2200(a, b) \u2208 A } =min\n\u00b5\n{ \u00b5 : (1\u2212 a(1\u2212 \u03b7+\u03b7\u2212))\u00b5 \u2265 (1\u2212 \u03b7+\u03b7\u2212)b \u2200(a, b) \u2208 A } = max\n(a,b)\u2208A \u03c2(a, b, \u03b7+\u03b7\u2212), where \u03c2(a, b, \u03b7+\u03b7\u2212) = 1\u2212 \u03b7+\u03b7\u2212 1\u2212 a(1\u2212 \u03b7+\u03b7\u2212)b.\nThe first equality follows directly from substitution. The second equality holds because the inequality in the optimization problem is valid for all (a, b) \u2208 A if and only if it is valid for a pair (a, b) \u2208 A that maximizes the right-hand side of the inequality. Note that the embedded maximization in the inequality does indeed maximize the right-hand side since 1\u2212 \u03b7+\u03b7\u2212 \u2265 0. The fourth equality holds because 1\u2212 a(1\u2212 \u03b7+\u03b7\u2212) > 0 as a \u2264 1 and \u03b7+\u03b7\u2212 \u2208 (0, 1].\nWe will now show that \u03c2 is convex in \u03b7+\u03b7\u2212 for all (a, b) \u2208 A, which will later imply that m is also convex in \u03b7+\u03b7\u2212. Note that \u03c2 is twice differentiable in \u03b7+\u03b7\u2212. In fact,\n\u2202 \u2202(\u03b7+\u03b7\u2212) \u03c2(a, b, \u03b7+\u03b7\u2212) = \u2212 b (1\u2212 a(1\u2212 \u03b7+\u03b7\u2212))2 and \u22022 \u2202(\u03b7+\u03b7\u2212)2 \u03c2(a, b, \u03b7+\u03b7\u2212) =\n2ab\n(1\u2212 a(1\u2212 \u03b7+\u03b7\u2212))3 .\nAs a \u2265 0 and b \u2265 0 for all (a, b) \u2208 A, the first and second derivatives are always nonpositive and nonnegative, respectively, which shows that \u03c2 is convex and nonincreasing in \u03b7+\u03b7\u2212. Since the pointwise maximum of convex functions is a convex function (Boyd and Vandenberghe, 2004, p. 80), the asymptotic slope m is thus also convex and nonincreasing in \u03b7+\u03b7\u2212.\nProof of Lemma 3. If y\u0307\u22c6 = 0, then we have\ny\u0307(g(xr), xr) = 0 \u21d0\u21d2 y\u0307(g(x r), xr)\nxr = \u03b7+\ng(xr)\nxr \u2212 \u03b7d\u03c6\n( \u2212g(x r)\nxr\n) = 0 \u21d0\u21d2 g(xr) = mxr\nfor all xr > 0, where the second equivalence holds because m is the unique solution to \u03b7+m \u2212 \u03b7d\u03c6(\u2212m) = 0, which is equivalent to m = (1\u2212\u03b7+\u03b7\u2212)\u03c6(m), as revealed by the proof of Proposition 4. For xr = 0, we have g(xr) = 0 = mxr because g is continuous on R+. Thus, g(xr) = mxr.\nProof of Theorem 1. The robust constraints are replaced by their deterministic counterparts from Proposition 2. The constraint on the expected terminal state-of-charge is enforced implicitly by expressing the decision variable xb as the function g(xr), characterized in Proposition 4.\nProof of Lemma 4. The feasible set X is convex if the function q(xr) = g(xr)\u2212 \u2113(xr) is monotonic, in which case there exists at most one intersection between g and \u2113. In the following, we show that Assumption 2 implies that q is strictly decreasing. The slope of q is maximal when the slope of g is maximal and the slope of \u2113 is minimal. The maximal slope of g is m, while the minimal slope of \u2113 is \u03b3T . The function q is strictly decreasing if its maximal slope is strictly negative, which is the case if m < \u03b3T . As \u03c6(m) = \u03c6(\u2212m) +m by Lemma 8, we have indeed\nm = (1\u2212 \u03b7+\u03b7\u2212)\u03c6(m) = ( 1\n\u03b7+\u03b7\u2212 \u2212 1\n) \u03c6(\u2212m) \u2264 ( 1\n\u03b7+\u03b7\u2212 \u2212 1\n) \u03c6(0) < 1\n2\n( 1\n\u03b7+\u03b7\u2212 \u2212 1\n) \u03b3\nT \u2264 \u03b3 T .\nThe first inequality holds because \u03c6 is nondecreasing and m \u2265 0. The strict inequality holds because \u03c6(0) < \u03b32T by Remark 1. The last inequality holds because \u03b7 +\u03b7\u2212 \u2265 13 by Assumption 2.\nProof of Theorem 2. Problem (P) minimizes the net cost T (cbg(xr)\u2212crxr) over X = [0, x\u0304r]. Since g is convex by Proposition 4, its derivative g\u2032 is nondecreasing (where it exists). The net marginal cost T (cbg\u2032(xr)\u2212 cr) is thus nondecreasing. As g is also proper and closed, Theorem 24.1 by Rockafellar (1970) implies that the right and left derivative functions g\u2032+ and g\u2032\u2212 are nondecreasing and that g\u2032+ is a pointwise upper bound on g\u2032\u2212. If x\u0304r = 0, the only feasible and therefore optimal solution is xr\u2217 = 0. If xr > 0, we distinguish three cases based on the values of g\u2032+(0) and g\u2032\u2212(x\u0304r).\nIf g\u2032+(0) \u2265 c r cb , the marginal profit is nonpositive for all feasible values of xr, and xr\u2217 = 0 is the\nsmallest optimal solution. Conversely, if g\u2032\u2212(x\u0304r) < cr cb , then the marginal profit is strictly positive for all feasible values of xr and xr\u2217 = x\u0304r is the only optimal solution. Finally, if g\u2032(0)+ < cr cb and g\u2032\u2212(x\u0304 r) \u2265 cr cb , then the set X\u22c6 of roots to the net marginal cost in (0, x\u0304r] is nonempty and compact because g is convex and continuous. Any root would be an optimal solution and, in particular, the smallest root xr\u2217 = minX\u22c6 is an optimal solution. This solution exists because X\u22c6 is compact.\nProof of Lemma 5. As \u03be\u0303 is supported on [\u22121, 1] we have \u00af \u03c6(\u03be) = \u03c6(\u03be) = \u03c6\u0304(\u03be) for all |\u03be| \u2265 1. For any |\u03be| < 1, \u00af \u03c6(\u03be) \u2264 \u03c6(\u03be) as \u00af \u03c6 is the piecewise maximum of three affine functions that are tangent to the convex function \u03c6 at \u03be = \u22121, = 0, and = 1. Conversely, \u03c6\u0304(\u03be) \u2265 \u03c6(\u03be) since \u03c6\u0304 is the piecewise maximum of two linear interpolations of \u03c6 from \u03be = \u22121 to \u03be = 0 and from \u03be = 0 to \u03be = 1.\nProof of Lemma 6. For any xr \u2265 0, the constraint y\u0307(xb, xr) = y\u0307\u22c6 implies that \u00af g(xr), g(xr), and g\u0304(xr) are the unique roots of the functions s \u00af \u03c6, s\u03c6, and s\u03c6\u0304, respectively, where s\u03c6 is defined as\ns\u03c6(x b) = y\u0307\u22c6 + \u03b7d\u03c6 ( \u2212x b\nxr\n) xr \u2212 \u03b7+xb\nand the functions s \u00af \u03c6 and s\u03c6\u0304 are defined similarly. By definition, we have 0 = s \u00af \u03c6( \u00af g(xr)) \u2264 s\u03c6( \u00af g(xr)), where the inequality holds because \u00af \u03c6( \u00af g(xr)) \u2264 \u03c6( \u00af g(xr)), see Lemma 5, and \u03b7dxr \u2265 0. Since s \u00af \u03c6 and s\u03c6 are strictly decreasing by Proposition 3, we must have g(xr) \u2265 \u00af g(xr). A similar reasoning shows that g\u0304(xr) \u2265 g(xr). As \u00af g, g, and g\u0304 are convex, the inequality \u00af g(xr) \u2264 g(xr) \u2264 g\u0304(xr) implies the inequality on the asymptotic slopes m \u2264 m \u2264 m.\nProof of Proposition 5. If y0 = y\u22c6, then y\u0307\u22c6 = y \u22c6\u2212y0 T = 0 and so g(x r) = mxr by Lemma 3. Hence, the constraints in Problem (P) obey the following equivalences.\nxr + g(xr) \u2264 y\u0304+ \u21d0\u21d2 xr \u2264 y\u0304 +\n1 +m\nxr \u2212 g(xr) \u2264 y\u0304\u2212 \u21d0\u21d2 xr \u2264 y\u0304 \u2212\n1\u2212m xr +max\n{ T\n\u03b3 g(xr), g(xr)\n} \u2264 y\u0304 \u2212 y0\n\u03b7+\u03b3 \u21d0\u21d2 xr \u2264 y\u0304 \u2212 y0 \u03b7+(\u03b3 +mT )\nxr \u2212min { T\n\u03b3 g(xr), g(xr)\n} \u2264 \u03b7\n\u2212y0 \u03b3\n\u21d0\u21d2 xr \u2264 \u03b7 \u2212y0\n\u03b3(1\u2212m)\nThe last two equivalences hold because T\u03b3 \u2265 1 and g(xr) = mxr \u2265 0 since any feasible xr must be nonnegative and since m is nonnegative by Proposition 4.\nProof of Theorem 3. If y0 = y\u22c6, then y\u0307\u22c6 = y \u22c6\u2212y0 T = 0 and so g(x r) = mxr by Lemma 3. Hence, g\u2032+(0) = g \u2032 \u2212(x\u0304 r) = m. Theorem 2 implies that xr\u2217 = 0 if m \u2265 c r cb and = x\u0304r otherwise."

Next, we provide all proofs that are not essential enough to be included in Appendix A of the main paper.\nB.1 Detailed Model Parameters\nB.1.1 Frequency Regulation\nThe technical term for the type of frequency regulation we consider is frequency containment reserves (FCR). France participates in a common European market for frequency containment reserves with a daily planning horizon.4 We thus set T = 24 hours. In its regulation on frequency containment reserves the European Commission specifies that the \u201cminimum activation period to be ensured by FCR providers [is not to be] greater than 30 or smaller than 15 minutes\u201d and that storage operators \u201cshall ensure the recovery of [their] energy reservoirs as soon as possible, within 2 hours after the end of the alert state\u201d (European Commission, 2017, art. 156(10, 13)), where an activation period designates a period of consecutive extreme frequency deviations \u03b4(t) \u2208 {\u22121, 1}. The total activation period \u03b3 to be ensured over a period of 24 hours is thus between 2.75 hours and 5 hours. The uncertainty set D contains all frequency deviation signals that correspond to a given total activation period \u03b3. Some of these signals may exhibit activation periods that are longer than the minimum activation period prescribed by the European Commission. The uncertainty set D is therefore a conservative approximation of the regulation by the European Commission. The strength of the delivery guarantee required by the European Commission can nevertheless be measured by the activation ratio \u03b3/T , that is, the fraction of time during which a storage operator must be able to provide all the regulation power she promised. When studying the profits a storage operator can reap from frequency regulation over the lifetime of an electricity storage device, we will vary the length of the planning horizon T while keeping the activation ratio constant. In line with the regulation by the European Commission, we will consider activation ratios of 0.1 and 0.2. 4https://entsoe.eu/network_codes/eb/fcr\nB.1.2 Electricity Prices\nIn the year 2019, the expected average price of regulation power was the same as the expected average availability price because E 1T \u222b T \u03b4\u0303(t)p\u0303 d(t) dt vanished. In fact, the average value of 1T \u222b T \u03b4(t)p d(t) dt over all days was \u22128.77 \u00b7 10\u22125. The minimum availability, wholesale market, and retail market prices in any half-hour interval were 0.41 ctskW\u00b7h , \u22122.49 ctskWh , and 14.5 ctskWh , respectively. Averaged over each day, the minimum daily average availability, wholesale market, and retail market prices were 0.41 ctskW\u00b7h , 0.37 cts kWh , and 14.5 cts kWh , respectively, which are all strictly positive. The ratio of daily average availability prices to daily average market prices of electricity was between 0.070 and 2.168 with an average of 0.251 for wholesale market prices, and between 0.026 and 0.133 with an average of 0.059 for retail market prices. Figure 6 shows the empirical cumulative distribution function of this ratio for wholesale and retail market prices. When studying the profits from frequency regulation over the planning horizon T and over the lifetimes of electricity storage devices, we will set the ratio of the expected average price of regulation power cr to the expected average market price of electricity cb to c r\ncb = 0.251 for wholesale market prices and to c\nr\ncb = 0.059 for retail market\nprices.\nThe desired charging rate y\u0307\u22c6 for meeting the terminal state-of-charge target influences the quantity and the price of regulation power that a storage operator can offer. Ideally, the storage operator would be able to meet the terminal state-of-charge target y\u22c6 not just in expectation but exactly. In the following, we assume that this is the case and that the terminal state-of-charge target stays constant from one planning horizon to another. The desired charging rate vanishes therefore during any given planning horizon. In this case, the implicit function g is the linear function g(xr) = mxr by Proposition 4. The marginal cost of providing frequency regulation is thus Tmcb. If the desired\ncharging rate was nonzero, then the marginal cost would be lower as the slope of g would converge to m only asymptotically. We thus overestimate the marginal cost of providing frequency regulation when assuming that y\u0307\u22c6 = 0. Regardless of the particular value of y\u0307\u22c6, it is therefore always profitable for the storage operator to sell as much regulation power as possible if the marginal revenue Tcr of providing frequency regulation is higher than the marginal cost Tmcb given y\u0307\u22c6 = 0, i.e., if c r\ncb > m.\nB.1.3 Frequency Deviation Distribution\nOver the years 2017 to 2019, the cumulative distribution function corresponding to P\u03be can be approximated by a symmetric logistic function F with a maximum error of 0.018 with respect to the empirical cumulative distribution function constructed from about 9.5 million frequency recordings with a 10 second resolution. This justifies Assumption 1. Based on the logistic approximation, the cumulative distribution function and the characteristic function are given by F (\u03be) = 11+exp (\u2212\u03b8\u03be) and \u03c6(\u03be) = ln(1+exp (\u03b8\u03be))\u03b8 , respectively, where \u03b8 = 2 ln (2) \u2206 and \u2206 = 2\u03c6(0) = 0.0816, which satisfies the condition \u2206 \u2264 \u03b3T in Assumption 2 as \u03b3 T \u2265 0.1. The coefficient \u03b8 was chosen such that frequency deviations have the same mean absolute deviation \u2206 under the logistic distribution as under the empirical distribution. In principle, F should be a truncated logistic function as the support of P\u03be, \u039e = [\u22121, 1], is bounded. The truncation error, however, is just 2.5 \u00b7 10\u22128, which we deem to be negligible. We find that the mean absolute deviation of the frequency recordings is smaller than 0.1 on 96.7% of all days. If the uncertainty set D is parametrized by \u03b3 = 0.1T , the empirical frequency deviation signals fall thus outside of D on 3.3% of all days. On these days, the storage operator may stop delivering regulation power once the total absolute deviation \u222b t 0 |\u03b4(t\u2032)| dt\u2032 of the frequency deviation signal exceeds \u03b3. In principle, the frequency deviation distribution should thus be estimated based on past frequency deviation signals with mean absolute deviation capped at the activation ratio \u03b3/T . The distribution estimated directly on past frequency deviation signals will differ most from the distribution estimated on capped past frequency deviation signals if the activation ratio is equal to 0.1 rather than 0.2. In this case, the maximum difference between the two distributions is less than 0.001, which we consider negligible compared to the maximum difference of 0.018 between the empirical cumulative distribution function and the logistic function F .\nFigure 7 shows the empirical cumulative distribution function and its logistic approximation.\nB.2 Detailed Results\nB.2.1 Impact of Charging and Discharging Losses on the Amount of Regulation Power\nCharging and discharging losses may impact the amount of regulation power x\u0304r a storage device can provide. We have seen in Section 5 that, if y\u0307\u22c6 = 0, then the storage device may be either energy-constrained or power-constrained.\nIf the storage device is power-constrained, then the storage operator can account for the roundtrip efficiency by dimensioning the discharging capacity y\u0304\u2212 as a fraction 1\u2212m1+m of the charging capacity y\u0304 + without restricting x\u0304r. The fraction is 1 at a roundtrip efficiency of 1, and decreases to 0.92 as the roundtrip efficiency decreases to 0.35.\nIf the storage device is energy-constrained, then charging losses increase the amount of energy that the storage device can consume from the grid, while discharging losses decrease the amount of energy that the storage device can deliver to the grid. The storage operator can offer most regulation power x\u0304r\u22c6 to the grid operator if the initial state-of-charge is such that she can consume as much energy from the grid as she can provide to the grid. For roundtrip efficiencies in (0, 1), the optimal initial state-of-charge y\u22c60 is nondecreasing in the activation ratio. Given activation ratios between 0.1 and 0.2, y \u22c6 0 y\u0304 is between 0.52 and 0.53 for lithium-ion batteries with a roundtrip efficiency of 0.85, between 0.57 and 0.60 for redox flow batteries with a roundtrip efficiency of 0.60, and between 0.66 and 0.69 for hydrogen storage with a roundtrip efficiency of 0.35.\nFigure 8 shows that the normalized regulation power x\u0304r\u22c6/ y\u0304 2\u03b3 is indeed nonincreasing in the charging efficiency \u03b7+ and nondecreasing in the discharging efficiency \u03b7\u2212. The decrease in \u03b7+ is more pronounced and the increase in \u03b7\u2212 is less pronounced if the activation ratio is 0.2 rather than 0.1. Starting from a roundtrip efficiency of 1 and an activation ratio of 0.2, the normalized regulation\npower increases from 1 to 1.45 as the charging efficiency decreases from 1 to 0.35, and decreases from 1 to 0.51 as the discharging efficiency decreases from 1 to 0.35. At an activation ratio of 0.1, the normalized regulation power increases to only 1.37 as the charging efficiency decreases to 0.35, and decreases slightly further to 0.48 as the discharging efficiency decreases to 0.35. Although the normalized regulation power is lower, the absolute regulation power is considerably higher at an activation ratio of 0.1 rather than 0.2, because the normalization constant y\u03042\u03b3 is inversely proportional to \u03b3.\nB.2.2 Operating Profits\nWe established in Section 6.2 that the profit per unit of regulation power increases with the roundtrip efficiency, while the maximum amount of regulation power increases with the discharging efficiency but decreases with the charging efficiency. The operating profit thus increases with the discharging efficiency, but it is unclear how it depends on the charging efficiency. Intuitively, the higher the market price of electricity, the more pronounced the increase of the profit per unit of regulation power in the charging efficiency. Similarly, the higher the activation ratio, the more pronounced the decrease of the maximum amount of regulation power in the charging efficiency. Figure 9 shows that, for activation ratios of 0.2 and 0.1, the operating profit increases with the charging efficiency at retail electricity prices but not at wholesale electricity prices. In practice, however, the combined effect\nof charging and discharging losses is usually a decrease in the operating profit, even at wholesale prices. As examples, we consider again lithium-ion batteries, vehicle-to-grid, and hydrogen storage, with the same charging and discharging efficiencies as in Section 6.2. At an activation ratio of 0.2, the operating profit is 2.25 ctskWh in the absence of charging and discharging losses, regardless of the market price of electricity. For lithium-ion batteries, the operating profit reduces to 2.15 ctskWh at wholesale prices and to 1.96 ctskWh at retail prices. For vehicle-to-grid, the operating profit decreases further to 1.92 ctskWh at wholesale prices and to 1.53 cts kWh at retail prices. For hydrogen, finally, the operating profit falls to 1.49 ctskWh at wholesale prices and to 0.81 cts kWh at retail prices. If the activation ratio halves from 0.2 to 0.1, the operating profits roughly double.\nB.3 Additional Proofs\nProof of Proposition 1. The proof is similar to the one of Proposition 1 by Lauinger et al. (2022), which analyzes the state-of-charge of an electric vehicle battery providing frequency regulation. The difference is that we do not model any electricity consumption for driving. By definition,\ny ( xb, xr, \u03b4, y0, t ) = y0 + \u222b t 0 \u03b7+ [ xb + \u03b4(t\u2032)xr ]+ \u2212 1 \u03b7\u2212 [ xb + \u03b4(t\u2032)xr ]\u2212 dt\u2032\n= y0 + \u222b t 0 min { \u03b7+ ( xb + \u03b4(t\u2032)xr ) , 1 \u03b7\u2212 ( xb + \u03b4(t\u2032)xr )} dt\u2032,\nwhere the second equality holds because 0 < \u03b7+ \u2264 1/\u03b7\u2212. As \u03b7+ > 0, \u03b7\u2212 > 0, and xr \u2265 0, both \u03b7+(xb+\u03b4(t\u2032)xr) and 1\n\u03b7\u2212 (x b+\u03b4(t\u2032)xr) are nondecreasing in \u03b4(t\u2032) and strictly increasing in xb. The min-\nimum of two (nondecreasing/strictly increasing) affine functions is a concave (nondecreasing/strictly increasing) function (Boyd and Vandenberghe, 2004, p. 73). The function y is thus concave strictly increasing in xb, concave in xr, concave nondecreasing in \u03b4, and affine nondecreasing in y0.\nProof of Lemma 1. The claim follows immediately from the definition of D.\nProof of Lemma (6). We first note that D can be replaced with D+ on the left-hand side of equation (6) because y is nondecreasing in \u03b4 by Proposition 1 and because D is symmetric by Lemma 1.\nBy construction, D+\u2193 \u2286 D+. The claim thus follows if, for every signal \u03b4 \u2208 D+, we can construct a rearranged signal \u03b4\u2193 \u2208 D+\u2193 such that\ny(xb, xr, \u03b4, y0, t) \u2264 y(xb, xr, \u03b4\u2193, y0, t) \u2200t \u2208 T . (13)\nWe fix an arbitrary \u03b4 \u2208 D+ and define its rearrangement \u03b4\u2193(t) = sup{\u03c1 \u2208 [0, 1] : \u222b T 1\u03b4(t\u2032)\u2265\u03c1 dt\n\u2032 \u2265 t} involving the indicator function 1\u03b4(t\u2032)\u2265\u03c1 = 1 if \u03b4(t\u2032) \u2265 \u03c1, and = 0 otherwise. Note that the maximization problem is feasible because \u03b4 \u2208 [0, 1]. We will now show that \u03b4\u2193 \u2208 D+\u2193 .\nTo this end, we first note that, by definition, \u03b4\u2193(t) \u2208 [0, 1] for all t \u2208 T . The signal \u03b4\u2193 is also nonincreasing because the feasible set of the maximization problem becomes smaller as t grows. In addition, \u03b4\u2193 is left-continuous. To see this, consider the random variable Y = \u03b4(t\u2032), where t\u2032 follows the uniform distribution on T . Then, \u03b4\u2193(t) = sup{\u03c1 \u2208 [0, 1] : P[Y \u2265 \u03c1] \u2265 tT }, which is left-continuous because the function P[Y \u2265 \u03c1] is left-continuous and nonincreasing.\nSince \u03b4 is Riemann integrable, it is also Lebesgue integrable. By the definition of the Lebesgue\nintegral, we have \u222b T 1\u03b4(t)\u2208B dt = \u222b T 1\u03b4\u2193(t)\u2208B dt\nfor any Borel set B \u2286 [0, 1], which implies that\u222b T \u03b4\u2193(t) dt = \u222b T \u03b4(t) dt \u2264 \u03b3, where the inequality holds because \u03b4 \u2208 D+. In summary, we have thus shown that \u03b4\u2193 \u2208 D+\u2193 . We will now show the inequality in (13). The state-of-charge function can be written as\ny(xb, xr, \u03b4, y0, t) =y0 + \u222b t 0 min { \u03b7+ ( xb + \u03b4(t\u2032)xr ) , 1 \u03b7\u2212 ( xb + \u03b4(t\u2032)xr )} dt\u2032\n=y0 + \u222b T 0 min { \u03b7+ ( xb + \u03b4(t\u2032)xr ) , 1 \u03b7\u2212 ( xb + \u03b4(t\u2032)xr )} \u00b7 1t\u2032\u2264t dt\u2032\n\u2264y0 + \u222b T 0 min { \u03b7+ ( xb + \u03b4\u2193(t \u2032)xr ) , 1 \u03b7\u2212 ( xb + \u03b4\u2193(t \u2032)xr )} \u00b7 1t\u2032\u2264t dt\u2032 =y(xb, xr, \u03b4\u2193, y0, t),\nwhere the first equality follows from the definition of y and from 0 < \u03b7+ \u2264 1/\u03b7\u2212. The second equality follows from the definition of the indicator function. The inequality is a variant of the HardyLittlewood rearrangement inequality (Hardy et al., 1988, Theorem 378), which applies because 1t\u2032\u2264t is nonincreasing and because the integrand y\u0307(\u03b4(t\u2032)) = min{\u03b7+(xb + \u03b4(t\u2032)xr), 1\u03b7\u2212 (xb + \u03b4(t\u2032)xr)} is nondecreasing in \u03b4(t\u2032) and thus admits the nonincreasing rearrangement y\u0307(\u03b4\u2193(t\u2032)).\nProof of Lemma 8. We first prove that the symmetry of P\u03be implies that F (z)+F (\u2212z) = 1+P\u03be[{z}] for all z \u2208 R. To see this, note that\nF (z) + F (\u2212z) = P\u03be ((\u2212\u221e, z]) + P\u03be ((\u2212\u221e,\u2212z]) = P\u03be ((\u2212\u221e, z]) + P\u03be ([z,\u221e)) = 1 + P\u03be [{z}] .\nThus, h(z) = F (z)\u22121/2(1+P\u03be[{z}]) = 1/2(1+P\u03be[{z}])\u2212F (\u2212z) = \u2212(F (\u2212z)\u22121/2(1+P\u03be[{\u2212z}])) = \u2212h(\u2212z) is an odd function, which implies that\n\u03c6(z) = \u222b z \u2212\u221e F (z\u2032) dz\u2032 = \u222b \u2212z \u2212\u221e F (z\u2032) dz\u2032 + \u222b z \u2212z F (z\u2032)\u2212 1 2 (1 + P\u03be[{z\u2032}]) + 1 2 (1 + P\u03be[{z\u2032}]) d\u03be\n= \u03c6(\u2212z) + \u222b z \u2212z 1 2 (1 + P\u03be[{z\u2032}]) d\u03be = \u03c6(\u2212z) + z.\nThe last equality holds as \u222b z \u2212z P\u03be[{z\u2032}]) dz\u2032 = 0. Indeed, the function P\u03be[{z\u2032}]) is nonzero only for countably many values of z\u2032 and is thus almost surely zero with respect to the Lebesgue measure."
