1. **In vitro and in vivo evaluation of the antiviral activity of the identified lead compounds:** The next step would be to evaluate the antiviral activity of the identified lead compounds against PRRSV in vitro and in vivo. This could be done using cell culture-based assays and animal models of PRRSV infection.


2. **Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies:** SAR studies could be conducted to determine the structural features of the lead compounds that are responsible for their antiviral activity. This information could be used to design and synthesize new compounds with improved potency and selectivity.


3. **Mechanism of action studies:** It would be important to investigate the mechanism of action of the lead compounds to determine how they inhibit Nsp4 activity. This information could be used to develop strategies to overcome resistance to the compounds.


4. **Toxicity and safety studies:** Before the lead compounds can be advanced to clinical trials, it is essential to conduct toxicity and safety studies to evaluate their potential for adverse effects.


5. **Clinical trials:** If the lead compounds are found to be safe and effective in preclinical studies, they could be advanced to clinical trials to evaluate their efficacy and safety in humans.
