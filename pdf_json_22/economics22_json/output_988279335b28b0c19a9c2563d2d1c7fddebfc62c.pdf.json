However, a clear\ndefinition of PB, benefits, and challenges is still faded. This work aims to\nsystematically review evidence on PB use in mental health and ID contexts,\nfrom both a qualitative and quantitative perspective, and summarize the\nrecent research on interventions, outcomes, and cost-effectiveness of PBs in\nbeneficiaries with mental health conditions and/or ID. The present systematic\nreview is an update of the existing literature analyzed since 2013. We\nperformed a systematic search strategy of articles using the bibliographic\ndatabases PubMed and PsycINFO. Six blinded authors screened the works\nfor inclusion/exclusion criteria, and two blinded authors extracted the data.\nWe performed a formal narrative synthesis of the findings from the selected\nworks.

            "heading": "Introduction",
            "text": "Personalization is a key element of the healthcare policy, as underlined by the World Health Organization (WHO) (1). It is built on a conception of a health system prioritizing human principles and rights, like equality, participation, selfdetermination, and non-discrimination. This means treating patients from a person-centered perspective, listening to their needs, and recognizing their capacities and freedom to choose their health. A person-centered approach should also tailor integrated services and goods to the needs of the individual with the goal of personal wellbeing (1). In this perspective, the delivery of the innovative intervention to set people at the center of their care and meet their identified health and wellbeing needs is a public health system\u2019s strategic action.\nAmong organization and management models based on this healthcare approach, personal budget (PB) consists of a sum of money allocated to an individual with the specific aim of fulfilling personal health needs. It derives from an evolution of direct payment, introduced in the United Kingdom in 1997 for disabled people, and subsequently extended and implemented across all adult social care (2, 3). The budget can be directly given to the beneficiary, or it can be managed by an intermediary belonging to the social or the public healthcare, delegated to purchase the services according to the person\u2019s needs (4, 5).\nAlthough the adoption of PB for health and social care is a challenge for the healthcare system, implying a change from the traditional care model, several benefits have been identified. The patient is placed as a subject rather than an object of care and can be actively involved in deciding on how to spend the budget and which services may best suit their personal needs. PBs can promote autonomy and empowerment by giving the patient the chance to participate in care actively, and the beneficiaries may experience more control and flexibility over care providers. Moreover, PBs consider different kinds of essential parts of health, like housing, employment, education, relationships, cultural background, and greater integration between health and social care, finally enabling people to select services they need, may reduce costs, and improve care planning (6). However, concern has also been expressed on PBs. An inner risk of direct payment, for instance, can arise from spending money in ways that do not turn out to be effective or in abuse by PB holders (4). Other consequences may involve the lack of quality and assurance in employment conditions and the risk of creating an unregulated situation (7).\nPersonal budgets have been tested in different countries, including the United Kingdom, Belgium, Denmark, Italy, Finland, Austria, France, Sweden, Germany, Australia, and the United States, with different types of programs, varying\nfrom inclusion criteria related to commissioned services or the person\u2019s degree of choice. Most programs aimed to promote autonomy and independent living, whereas others focused on the caregiver\u2019s system. In Belgium, for instance, the aim was to reduce the use of expensive residential care, while in the United States it was a shortage of long-term staff. The target population also differed between countries. In Canada, PBs were directed to children with learning disabilities, whereas in the United Kingdom the focus was on the elderly and on subjects with long-term disabilities (8).\nNational and international PB\u2019s experience mainly refers to users in charge of mental health services and their carers (5, 6, 9\u201311). This population has reported personal satisfaction related to the greater choice and motivation (12), greater participation in community life and supported employment related to selfdirected initiatives (13), and overall better quality of life experienced with PBs\u2019 programs (6). For example, the \u201cFlorida Self-Directed Care Program\u201d offered to people with persistent mental illness resulted those participants rarely resorted to crisis stabilization units compared to non-participants (8). In a previous review, Webber et al. suggested positive outcomes regarding choice and control, impact on quality of life, service use, and cost-effectiveness for PB users in mental health. However, methodological limitations (i.e., different outcomes measures, limited follow-up periods, small sample size, and qualitative study design) limited the conclusions. Moreover, PB programs were implemented differently among countries, leading to additional difficulties in generalizing practices (14). Additional studies have been conducted in recent years, providing further evidence on the possible benefits of using PB in mental health settings. This is essential to inform current PB policies and practices with people with mental health conditions.\nWe believe that the inclusion, in the population benefiting of the PBs, of people with intellectual disability (ID) together with people with mental health conditions is important. Higher rate of mental illness in comparison with the general population is consistently observed in adults with ID (15, 16). A wide-ranging prevalence of 14\u2013 75% for clinically distinguishable mental illness in people with ID has been identified (17). ID is also considered among the leading psychiatric diagnoses and contributes, along with other mental disorders, to a major burden in terms of disability among young people (18). Mental health services should be prepared to meet the needs of people with ID.\nIn this study, thus, we aimed (a) to review the literature available from 2013 on PBs\u2019 use in mental health contexts, from both a qualitative and quantitative perspective, and (b) to summarize the recent evidence on interventions, outcomes, and cost-effectiveness of PBs in beneficiaries with mental health conditions and/or with ID.\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 02 frontiersin.org\nMicai et al. 10.3389/fpsyt.2022.974621\nFIGURE 1 Flow chart of the literature selection process."

We performed a systematic search strategy\n1 www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/\nof articles indexed from 01 April 2013 to 15 September 2021 using the bibliographic databases PubMed and PsycINFO. We choose to start our search strategy in April 2013 because the latest systematic review on the field ended its search strategy in that period (14). The search strategy focused on Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcomes (PICO) domains. Population: PB for people with mental health conditions and/or people with ID. Intervention: terms related to the PB; Comparison: not applicable; Outcome: desired and undesirable effects of PB. We developed the search strategy using a combination of MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) and terms to capture the available literature on the topic.

This search strategy was peer-reviewed by experts in the field. Details of the search strategy are presented in Supplementary Table 1.

Eleven studies were conducted in the United Kingdom, 11 in the United States, 6 in Italy, and 1 in Australia. Four quasi-experimental studies were found (26\u201329). Nine studies reported follow-up data (27, 30\u2013 37). A total of 11,541 people participated in the 29 selected studies (range = 9; (38) \u2013 6,908; (26); in studies conducted by the same authors, the participants may overlap). The mean ages of samples ranged from 26.08 (33, 34) to 58.7 (30) years. The proportion of females ranged from 26% (33) to 87% (39). Studies evaluated PB (n = 9), personal health budgets (n = 4), health budget (n = 1), individual budget (n = 1), self-directed care (n = 3), individual health budget (n = 2), patient-centered medical home (PCMH) (n = 1), person-centered planning (n = 1), Mental Health Access to Recovery or MHATR (n = 1),\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 08 frontiersin.org\nMicai et al. 10.3389/fpsyt.2022.974621\nTABLE 2 Findings\u2019 summary of the included works on PHB for people with mental health conditions.\nAdinolfi et al. (30) (Italy)\nHB led to significant cost savings, mostly associated with the reduction of the cases of institutionalization and the higher appropriateness of health care services. HB let to more suitable health treatment, reducing redundancies and omissions. HB led to improvement in problems related to alcohol and/or drug addiction; cognitive, physical or disability problems; problems associated with hallucinations and delusions, with depressed mood; mental and behavioral problems; problems with relationships, with activities of daily living, with living conditions, and with occupation and activities. Patients and informal caregivers expressed medium-high levels of satisfaction with the HB program.\nBowdoin et al. (26) (United States)\nNo statistically significant differences between participants who received patient-centered medical home (PCMH) care and participants who received non-PCMH care or usual care in terms service utilization, cost, or expenditures.\nCook et al. (31) (United States)\nThe budget-neutral self-directed care model achieved superior client outcomes and greater satisfaction with mental health care, compared with services as usual. Self-directed care users compared to the control group showed greater improvement over time in recovery, self-esteem, coping mastery, autonomy support, somatic symptoms, employment, and education. The costs of self-directed care users were lower, comparing with the control group. Self-directed care users reported higher satisfaction with mental health services.\nCroft and Parish (46) (United States)\nThe program participation helped the majority of responders to meet basic material needs that had been impeding them from achieving or setting personal goals. Six interviewees expressed confusion and frustration at what they saw as inconsistent policies, particularly for purchases that address basic needs like rent, transportation, and household goods.\nCroft et al. (27) (United States)\nSelf-directing participants were more likely to improve or maintain engagement in paid work (small effect size) and independent housing (small effect size).\nCroft et al. (28) (United States)\nSelf-directing users showed greater increases in outpatient and rehabilitation services compared to the non-self-directing group, in terms of hours of rehabilitation services. No differences in residential days or emergency service hours between groups.\nCroft et al. (29) (United States)\nNo difference in the percentage of individuals who used at least one service in each service category before and after participation to the program. Lower median standardized monthly mental health clinical outpatient costs compared to the past by a model of pre-post examination. No differences in the total service costs before and after program participation.\nFontecedro et al. (49) (Italy)\nThe Individual Health Budget (IHB) was used in patients with severe clinical and social problems. The beneficiaries were at higher risk compared to controls of severe problems with regard to aggressive or agitated behaviors, hallucinations and delusions, and impairment in everyday life activities. The risk of hospitalization in the IHB sample compared to controls was 1.4-fold higher, regardless of diagnosis. The clinical and functional impairment (HoNOS total scores) did not differ between IHB and controls.\nHamilton et al. (45) (United Kingdom)\nMost of the practitioners interviewed felt that they had already always worked in patient-centered ways. Most of all reported to be more affiliated with the dominant medical model, rather than the person-centered model. Some mental health nurses expressed that the PB is perceived as a distraction from the work of nursing. Other nurses argued that specific skills that characterized their profession were being side-lined to engage in implementing PBs. Several social workers described their priorities in terms of a medical model of mental health, requiring treatment first and social support later. They reported the perception of insufficient time to engage with the process of PBs, perceiving it as bureaucratic, complicated and time consuming. Social workers identified the voluntary or third sector as a potential resource for PB. Occupational therapists described PBs as fitting more closely with occupational therapy practice. They often found personalization to be an opportunity to reclaim their focus away from the medical model and back to the traditional goals of occupational therapy.\nHamilton et al. (50) (United Kingdom)\nCarers were commonly involved in decisions made through assessment, support planning and reviews the PB. Criticisms of the PB by carers: the process for accessing and reviewing PBs was not well designed for people with severe mental health conditions to manage: the \u201cpaperwork\u201d was stressful; carers felt the role to protect the service user from mental health systems and practitioners who were not making decisions in their best interests; carers perceived that PB funding was reduced because of practitioners\u2019 assumptions about carers\u2019 willingness and ability to provide support; conflicts with staff around appropriate involvement in decision-making. Parents often felt the need to help the service user to be heard in assessment and support planning meetings. Partners, when considering a PB, felt treated more as a unit.\nHamilton et al. (44) (United Kingdom)\nOpportunities of the PB perceived by user services and staff: users\u2019 power and control, collaboration with staff, and quality and continuity of the professional relationship. Challenges of the PB perceived by user services: few of them felt unable to manage the budget and saw the staff as an obstruction to the PB. Challenges of the PB perceived by staff: few of them were reluctant to engage the PB. The process of reaching decisions of local authority led them to feel a sense of distance that limited their power of influence.\nHarry et al. (48) (United States)\nAll participants were satisfied about the Cash and Counseling-based self-directed services program and perceived their personal care need met. All participants trusted their caregiver(s). Two women talked about how the program reduced financial stress on the family and young adult. Five representatives described financial concerns with the monthly allowance amount left after paying attendants and confusion about program rules.\nHitchen et al. (54) (United Kingdom)\nUsers, carers, and staff perceived the need for cultural change, PBs\u2019 effect on outcomes, and service-users\u2019 capacity to manage these responsibilities.\nKogan et al. (32) (United States)\nThe use of historical claims data can lead to an overestimation of eligible participants and, subsequently, a reduced study sample and an imbalance between intervention arms. Inclusion of multiple data sources in study design can improve data completeness. The use of a \u201ctrain-the-trainer\u201d model, \u201cwellness champions,\u201d and the use of a Learning Collaborative approach may help in overcoming training and intervention fidelity challenges (i.e., geographic dispersion of rural provider sites and staff turnover). Stakeholder engagement may mitigate these challenges critical to study progress.\n(Continued)\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 09 frontiersin.org\nMicai et al. 10.3389/fpsyt.2022.974621\nTABLE 2 (Continued)\nLarkin (43) (United Kingdom)\nPerceived positive effects of PB by carers: enhancement of the carer\u2013service user relationship, feeling happier, healthier and having more control over their lives. Perceived negative effects of PB by carers: less involvement in the service user\u2019s care, perception of the administration of the PB as stressful.\nLarsen et al. (52) (United Kingdom)\nMost participants identified positive outcomes from using PBs (e.g., mental health and wellbeing, social participation and relationships, and confidence). Some participants needed more support to identify goals and make use of the PB to take a more active part in the society.\nLeuci et al. (33) (Italy)\nSignificant effect of time on functioning and all the psychopathological and clinical variables in patients enrolled and not enrolled in PHB across the 2 years of follow-up. At the end of the 2 years follow-up, patients enrolled in the PHB intervention reported higher improvements in negative symptoms, disorganization, and activation dimension (including manic features and hyperactivity) and in HoNOS \u201cImpairment\u201d subscale (combining cognitive and disability problems). In the time between T1 and T2, patients enrolled in the PHB showed a further significant decrease in positive symptoms, activation, and affective dimension (including depressive characteristics, suicidality, and anxiety), improvements in functioning, and in HoNOS \u201cImpairment,\u201d \u201cPsychiatric Symptoms,\u201d and \u201cBehavioural Problems\u201d subscales. Significant \u201ctime x group\u201d interaction effects in BPRS \u201cDisorganization,\u201d HoNOS \u201cPsychiatric Symptoms,\u201d and GAF scores in patients enrolled in the PHB, suggesting an additional improvement both in symptoms and in functioning for those receiving the PHB intervention model.\nMitchell et al. (47) (United Kingdom)\nAll practitioners\u2019 focus groups reported that their authorities recognized the importance of involving carers in the service user personalization processes. Involvement in support planning of practitioners and carers was considered necessary. Moreover, a good support plan for service users was perceived as having indirect benefits for carers. Carers were reported to be often involved in the managing of the PBs. Staff reported that conflicts on service users\u2019 abilities and support needs between staff and service users and carers were most likely to arise during assessment and support planning of the PB. In the management of conflicts were considered important \u201cgood\u201d social work skills and practitioner sensitivity.\nNorrie et al. (39) (United Kingdom)\nThe 64% of personal assistants saw their current roles as congruent with PHBs, were willing to engage with PHBs and undertake health-related tasks. The 74% of personal assistants perceived the need of additional training if enacting PHB. Key informants perceived the development of HBs as complex.\nPelizza et al. (34) (Italy)\nPHB approach within an \u201cEarly Intervention in Psychosis\u201d program showed a significant effect of time on all Health of Nation Outcome Scales (HoNOS), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scores along the 2 years of follow-up. PHB multiaxial intervention was associated with longitudinal decrease in BPRS \u201cNegative Symptoms,\u201d HoNOS \u201cBehavioral Problems,\u201d and \u201cSocial Problems\u201d subscores.\nPelizza et al. (35) (Italy)\nPHB approach showed a significant decrease in all GAF scale, HoNOS and BPRS scores along the 2 years of follow-up. PHB multiaxial intervention was associated with longitudinal decrease in BPRS \u201cNegative Symptoms,\u201d and HoNOS \u201cSocial Problems\u201d subscores.\nPeterson et al. (40) (Australia)\nThe three over-arching categories impacting the lived experiences of shared management, person-centered and self-directed (SPS) consumers individuated by the authors were: (1) Access to individualized funds enabled practical and psychological benefits to consumers; (2) Consistent contact in shared management and person-centered relationships enhanced the provision of timely and meaningful staff\nsupport to consumers; (3) High quality shared management and person-centered relationships with staff and the opportunity to self-direct services enabled\nconsumers\u2019 change and growth.\nRidente and Mezzina et al. (36) (Italy)\nThe individual HB method boosted the shift toward personalized supported housing for people with severe mental health conditions and complex problems. For people, the use of HB method resulted in increased personal autonomy and higher personalization of interventions. For services, the use of HB method brought about significant changes is the way resources were used and in the personalized intervention approach within local Mental Health Department teams (transparency, clarity on spending decisions, and increased awareness of the importance of a rational use of resources based on an adequate turnover of projects). Regarding housing, the number and type of community organizations involved in the co-management of HBs has increased significantly by a closer collaboration and synergy among different third sector agencies.\nSnethen et al. (53) (United States)\nThe majority of people with serious mental illness can identify a number of goods or services not traditionally available through Medicaid that would facilitate their mental health. Fewer than 10% of requests across all participants were categorized within unique World Health Organization\u2019s International Classification of Function, Disability, and Health (ICF) codes. Needs changed depending on the diagnosis and were consistent with the ICF diagnostic core sets.\nSpaulding-Givens et al. (41) (United States)\nUsers reported that individualized budgeting and purchasing contributed to their mental wellness, stability, and self-esteem; enhanced their control over service choices, and provided some material relief in ongoing struggles with chronic poverty. Several participants reported that coaches played an important role in supporting participants\u2019 self-direction by mitigating potential purchasing barriers (lack of clarity and flexibility in purchasing guidelines, technicalities in purchasing procedures, perceived disconnect between purchases and goals, and participants\u2019 struggles with symptoms). Flexible spending guidelines and streamlined approval processes are needed; overly proscriptive policies may undermine participants\u2019 self-determination.\nTew et al. (51) (United Kingdom)\nSome participants did not find it easy to adjust to the opportunity to think and take responsibility for themselves. Participants highlighted how practitioners adopting a co-productive or coaching style of working could help them broaden their horizons. Several participants declared that an access to economic capital enabled them to have better quality of day-to-day life. Others saw their budget as a mechanism for organizing personal support in terms of how they were living their lives. The peer supporting has an emotional significance for the persons involved.\n(Continued)\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 10 frontiersin.org\nMicai et al. 10.3389/fpsyt.2022.974621\nTABLE 2 (Continued)\nThomas et al. (37) (United States)\nThe majority of participants reported experiencing greater choice and control in the selection of services for supporting recovery goals, as a result of their participation in self-direct care intervention. Competence, autonomy, and relatedness were well connected to participant\u2019s experiences of increased choice.\nWelch et al. (42) (United Kingdom)\nPHB-holders and front-line staff perceived the following opportunities: increase in choice and control; improvement in relationships between budget-holders and their care staff; increase in power to service providers and commissioners. PHB-holders and front-line staff perceived the following operational challenges: \u201cwhen\u201d to offer a PHB as often clients were referred at \u201ccrisis point\u201d; what support could be purchased from the PHB, and it was thought that more guidance was required; the budget was held by the commissioner; risk, accountability, and safety. The importance of strong leadership was viewed as a crucial factor by all staff groups.\nWilliams and Porter et al. (38) (United Kingdom)\nAll the participants relied on praise and encouragement, and when this was not forthcoming, they became anxious or unsure of themselves. People members of self-advocacy groups helped other people with intellectual disabilities and contributed toward society through voluntary work or within their family. Although relationships were key to participants, they played out very differently in the various contexts of their lives. Despite the lack of real engagement with the PB processes, people clearly valued their own choices. What was needed by all participants was a more personalized approach which would understand the detail of their sense of identity, the people in their lives, and their day-to-day living, for them to build a continued sense of control.\npersonalization of the care (n = 1), Cash and Counselingbased self-directed services program (n = 1), behavioral health home intervention arm (n = 1), shared management (n = 1), person-centered and self-directed (SPS) service (n = 1), and supported housing (n = 1), as defined by the authors, to define PB, which exist different acronyms (e.g., PB, PHB, and HB). We maintained definitions and acronyms used in each original work.\nEight studies [only two with quantitative data, (30, 31)] contained validated measures (e.g., Health of the Nation Outcome Scales, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, Global Assessment of Functioning, and World Health Organization\u2019s International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health).\nWe maintained the domains\u2019 classification given by Webber et al. (14) (i.e., choice and control of care and support; impact on life; service use; economic evaluations) and, for clarity seek, four authors classified the studies based on further subdomains (for choice and control of care and support: patient center-care, stakeholder engagement, involvement of carers or staff, timely and suitable access to treatment, phenotype assessment of HB patient, satisfaction of users, challenges of users, carers, and professionals; for impact on life: clinical improvement, quality of life, improvement in everyday life activities, engagement in work/independent housing, and frequency and quality of service use; for service use: frequency and quality of service use and lack of transitional support).\nChoice and control of care and support"

            "heading": "Discussion",
            "text": "The present systematic review has updated the existing literature since 2013 (14). More than 9,000 publications were screened. The scientific literature on PBs in the last 9 years is significantly increased (Table 3), and many valuable results have been achieved toward the definition of benefits and challenges of PBs for people with mental health conditions.\nThe studies have been conducted in the United Kingdom (n = 11), United States (n = 11), Italy (n = 6), and one in Australia. The majority of the studies have been conducted using qualitative methodologies (n = 20) based on not validated qualitative study-specific interviews. Only eight studies used validated tools to assess outcomes. One study did not specify the methodology used to assess the outcomes. In addition, the PBs\u2019 outcomes were explored for the most in adult populations (n = 26). Many of the studies (n = 7) did not provide the age of the population interviewed. More than the 50% of females were enrolled in the majority of the studies\u2019 samples (n = 20).\nThe studies included in the present systematic review show some limitations that make difficult in generalizing the results. First, the distribution of the countries among the\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 15 frontiersin.org\nMicai et al. 10.3389/fpsyt.2022.974621\nincluded studies is only representative of the state of art in the western world. Also, comparison of PBs among countries is complicated because of the profoundly different characteristics of the healthcare system of reference. Future research should seek to depict the situation of the PB for people with mental health conditions in the rest of the world and describe in detail the characteristics of the healthcare system. Second, many studies included a small sample size, were mostly qualitative design, and did not use validated instruments to measure the outcomes, and the studies\u2019 quality measured by the risk of bias was not always satisfactory. As Webber et al. (14) registered in their review, we also reported that most of the studies lacked justification for the research design and insufficient data analysis rigor. All qualitative studies lacked critical consideration of the researcher\u2019s role, potential bias, and influence. All cross-sectional studies lacked the application of strategies to deal with potential confounding factors. Future cohort studies should seek to consider strategies to deal with confounding factors, strengthen the association between exposure and outcome, complete large time-span followups, and recruit more homogenous experimental and control samples. More evidence-based research practice, longitudinal studies, and good quality studies using validated tools to assess the outcomes need to be conducted to explore in a more systematic manner the outcomes of the PBs. Third, the samples of the included studies were not representative of targeted population and lacked a full description of the phenotype of the participants with mental health conditions. For example, several studies did not describe the severity of the users\u2019 symptoms, if users have intellectual disabilities, communication, or language problems. Finally, the payments used in the PB were often omitted. Those are fundamental aspects to consider when users are called to manage their PBs and should be carefully considered in future research. Also, future studies should seek to explore how and whether the personal PBs may be beneficial for target populations such as women, children, adolescents, elderly, and people with mental health conditions in comorbidity with intellectual disabilities. Fourth, as Webber et al. (14) observed in the studies older than 2013, interpretation is limited by the heterogeneity of the PB protocols: different payment, support, funding mechanisms, outcome measures, and context were described in each study. It urges to conduct large number of studies to be able to combine similar protocols for improving the outcomes\u2019 interpretation.\nKeeping into consideration these limitations, we can draw some general lessons. Positive outcomes for patients with mental health conditions utilizing PBs have been confirmed in terms of choice and control. The use of PB for people with mental health conditions showed several benefits in patient empowerment, stakeholder engagement, involvement of carers or staff in the PBs, and timely and suitable access to treatment. In general, several studies showed\nsatisfaction for the PBs (30, 46, 48). Also, PBs improved users\u2019 clinical outcomes, quality of life, and engagement in paid work and independent living. PBs brought to significant changes in the way resources were used and in the personalized intervention approaches (36, 40). PBs brought also to cost savings for the families (48) and the national health systems (30).\nConcerns and challenges have been expressed on PBs in several studies. Users and carers perceived difficult and stressful the management and procedures of PBs (39, 43, 44, 46, 50, 51). Carers perceived difficulties in negotiating PBs with professionals (50) and felt less involvement in the care of their beloved ones (43). Professionals perceived the management of PBs as an additional burden in their work (43, 45, 47). Results on change in the frequency of the services\u2019 use, efficacy of the services, and cost savings for the families or healthcare systems are inconsistent. On the one hand, some studies showed no differences in the frequency of service utilization, no solution for the gap in transition services (26, 48), no differences in terms of expenditures (26), and concerns with allowance (48). On the other hand, other studies showed that PBs led to cost savings for the healthcare system (30, 36) and the families (48). Studies that explore potential cost savings led by PBs should be increased in terms of quantity and quality.\nThe studies included in the present systematic review explored the outcomes of follow-ups longer than 2 years [except for one study Adinolfi et al. (30): 1 year], and two studies had follow-ups even longer [4, 8 years: (27); 10 years: (36)]. A positive aspect is that the recent studies we included in this work extended the time of the follow-ups compared to the studies in Webber et al. conducted before 2013 [follow-ups of 1 year or even less, (14)]."

However, the present systematic review showed that several challenges and concerns arise from the application of PBs and highlight the need to make the management of PBs less stressful and burdensome for users, carers, and professionals.\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 16 frontiersin.org\nMicai et al. 10.3389/fpsyt.2022.974621"
