This study was not preregistered.\nThe organization of the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) model provides unique opportunities to evaluate whether neural risk measures operate as indicators of broader latent liabilities (e.g., externalizing proneness) or narrower expressions (e.g., antisociality, alcohol abuse). Following this approach, the current study recruited a sample of 182 participants (54% female) who completed measures of externalizing psychopathology (also internalizing) and associated traits. Participants also completed three tasks (Flanker \u2013 No-Threat, Flanker - Threat, and Go/No-Go tasks) with event-related potential (ERP) measurement. Three variants of two RDoC-based neurophysiological indicators\u2014P3 and error-related negativity (ERN)\u2014 were extracted from these tasks and used to model two latent ERP factors. Scores on these two ERP factors independently predicted externalizing factor scores when accounting for their covariance with sex \u2013 suggesting distinct neural processes contributing to the broad externalizing factor. No predictive relation with the broad internalizing factor was found for either ERP factor. Analyses at the finer-grained level revealed no unique predictive relations of either ERP factor with any specific externalizing symptom variable when accounting for the broad externalizing factor, indicating that ERN and P3 index general liability for problems in this spectrum. Overall, this study provides new insights about neural processes in externalizing psychopathology at broader and narrower levels of the HiTOP hierarchy.\nKeywords: HiTOP, psychopathology, externalizing, ERP, P3, ERN\nGeneral Scientific Summary: The Hierarchical Taxonomy Model of Psychopathology argues that some etiological factors might operate at broader levels of the psychopathological spectrum, conferring general risk for clinical problems Our results show that ERN and P3 responses are indicators of distinct neural processes and that both account for externalizing proneness.\nprocesses. However, several challenges have hampered progress in this area, including the complex nature of mental disorders, which often co-occur (diagnostic comorbidity) and vary in their clinical expression (diagnostic heterogeneity) (Clark et al., 2017; Haslam et al., 2020; Krueger et al., 2021). Efforts to understand mental health problems in neurobiological terms need to contend with the overlapping, complex nature of psychopathology \u2013 which is best represented by dimensional models like the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP).\nThe HiTOP model characterizes psychopathology in terms of hierarchically organized\ndimensions. Specific symptom dimensions load onto broader syndromes and subfactors that load, in turn, onto even broader spectrum dimensions. At the uppermost level is the \u201cp-factor\u201d \u2013 representing general propensity toward any form of psychopathology (Caspi et al., 2014; Caspi & Moffitt, 2018; Kotov et al., 2017). At the next level below, one can find the internalizing and externalizing dimensions. The internalizing dimension encompasses lower-order anxiousdepressive syndrome dimensions (e.g., phobias, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress), organized around subordinate fear and distress subfactors. The externalizing broad factor subsumes impulsive personality pathology along with antisocial and substance use disorders, which are organized around antagonistic and disinhibited externalizing subfactors. At the lowest levels of HiTOP, several symptom and trait dimensions are represented (DeYoung et al., 2022; Forbes et al., 2021; Kotov et al., 2017).\nThe hierarchical organization of HiTOP implies that some etiological factors operate at\nbroader levels of a spectrum, conferring general risk for problems, whereas others operate at the level of specific syndromes, or symptoms and traits associated with them (DeYoung et al., 2022). From this viewpoint, one would predict that neurobiological indicators of dysfunction would relate in some cases to broad risk dimensions, and in others to more specific expressions. Working from this perspective, this study examined the extent to which two brain eventrelated potential (ERP) components from the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) system (Clark\nthe response-elicited error-related negativity (ERN) (see Krueger et al., 2021 for an overview) \u2013 operate as indicators of transdiagnostic risk (broad externalizing psychopathology) or finegrained clinical expression (specific syndrome level). Another key question addressed was whether these ERPs overlap in their associations with externalizing problems, as co-indicators of a common dysfunctional process, or if they instead show independent associations, as indicators of specific problem dimensions. P3 and ERN as Neural Indicators of Externalizing Proneness\nThe P3 is comprised of various sub-components elicited by different tasks and stimuli,\nand has been functionally linked to different cognitive operations, such as context updating, attentional resource allocation, elaborative processing of motivational significance, inhibitory control, and behavioral adaptations (Friedman et al., 2001; Huster et al., 2013; Nieuwenhuis et al., 2005; Polich, 2007). Several overlapping functional processes contribute to P3 elicitation during the processing of motivationally significant events, including anterior-frontal processes mediating early attention-orienting responses, and temporal/parietal processes related to stimulus evaluation and context updating (see Polich, 2007 for a review).\nResearch to date suggests that reduced P3 amplitude indexes general risk for exter-\nnalizing problems of various types, rather than being disorder-specific (Krueger et al., 2021). Reduced P3 amplitude has been reported in different clinical conditions subsumed under the broad externalizing factor (Euser et al., 2013; Gao & Raine, 2009; Iacono et al., 2003; Pasion & Barbosa, 2019). One key study by Patrick et al. (2006) found a robust negative association for oddball target P3 amplitude with externalizing problems defined as the common factor linking substance dependence, childhood conduct disorder, and adult antisocial symptoms, and showed that no individual syndrome among these was uniquely associated with P3 amplitude after accounting for the broad externalizing factor. These findings were replicated subsequently using trait-scale measures (Krueger et al., 2007; Patrick et al., 2013). Twin research\ntributable to shared genetic variance, supporting the idea that reduced P3 indexes dispositional vulnerability to the broad factor of externalizing (Hicks et al., 2007; Krueger et al., 2021; Yancey et al., 2013).\nAnother ERP component that has been proposed as a potential biomarker for general\nexternalizing problems is reduced amplitude of ERN (e.g., Hall et al., 2007; Lutz et al., 2021; Pasion & Barbosa, 2019, for meta-analytic evidence). The ERN is an early (100-ms post-behavioral-response) frontocentral negative deflection that is enhanced following incorrect responses (Falkenstein et al., 1991; Gehring et al., 1993). While the ERN has been functionally linked to error/mismatch detection (Falkenstein et al., 2000), reinforcement learning (Holroyd & Coles, 2002), and/or post-response conflict processing (Yeung et al., 2004), all theoretical models converge around the idea that the ERN reflects an early signal for the implementation of control mechanisms following action mistakes (Gehring et al., 2012). The ERN has been consistently linked to the activity of structures in the posterior medial frontal brain, including the anterior cingulate cortex and pre-supplementary motor area (Herrmann et al., 2004; Iannaccone et al., 2015; van Veen & Carter, 2002) \u2013 regions found to be implicated in situations requiring increased cognitive control, such as response conflict, performance errors, and decision uncertainty (Ridderinkhof et al., 2004; Ullsperger et al., 2014). Aside from theories linking the ERN to cognitive control mechanisms, other theoretical views have highlighted the relevance of motivational factors, positing that variations in ERN amplitude may reflect, at least in part, a motivational defensive response to signals of potential threat (Hajcak & Foti, 2008; Weinberg et al., 2012).\nAlthough limited research has examined the extent to which the ERN might operate as\nan indicator of the broad externalizing factor vs. specific clinical syndromes (Krueger et al., 2021), it is worth noting that results from two meta-analyses have found little evidence for a moderating role of diagnosis in explaining blunted ERN amplitudes within the externalizing\nresent a transdiagnostic liability indicator of general proneness to impulse control problems, reflected by the broad externalizing factor. Notably, some prior studies have reported enhanced ERN in relation to internalizing psychopathology problems, but effect sizes appear to be more modest, especially when considering the diversity of internalizing expressions and when correcting for publication bias (Macedo et al., 2021; Pasion & Barbosa, 2019; Saunders & Inzlicht, 2020). Associations of P3 with internalizing conditions have been more mixed as well, with some studies reporting reduced P3 amplitude in distress disorders but enhanced P3 amplitude in relation to fear disorders (Watson et al., 2022 for a review). ERN and P3 as Distinct Processes Linked to Externalizing Problems\nFactor analytic studies reveal that P3 and ERN may index distinct neurocognitive pro-\ncesses. There is evidence of a common P3 factor emerging from P3 responses measured in separate tasks: however, variants of the ERN loaded onto a separate response-monitoring factor in one study (Burwell et al., 2016) and onto a distinct ERN/N2 factor in another study (Ribes-Guardiola et al., 2020). These findings indicate that these components may index distinct neurocognitive processes linked to externalizing symptoms, with the former reflecting diminished elaborative-associative processing of motivationally significant events and the latter reflecting deficits in the engagement of early, reactive cognitive control processes following\naction mistakes (Gehring et al., 2012; Polich, 2007).\nGiven these prior findings, a compelling need exists for characterizing the nature of\nexternalizing-related dysfunctions indexed by variants of the P3 and the ERN. Research has demonstrated the validity of combining several variants of the P3 response in conjunction with scale measures of externalizing psychopathology (Nelson et al., 2011; Patrick et al., 2013; Venables et al., 2018) but there is still a need to parse the nature of the externalizing-related reductions in other P3 variants vis-a-vis ERN measurements. Although a moderate degree of convergence between ERN\u2019s derived from different tasks is typically observed (i.e., in the .33 - .45 correlation range) (Burwell et al., 2016; Ribes-Guardiola et al., 2020; Riesel et al., 2013),\nexternalizing symptoms than other tasks (Pasion & Barbosa, 2019; Ribes-Guardiola et al., 2020). By contrast, a meta-analytic study reported no moderating effects of task type in studies assessing ERN-externalizing associations (Lutz et al., 2021). Thus, there is a need to further explore the convergence among distinct variants of the ERN in their relations with the broad externalizing factor and evaluate whether P3 and ERN index distinct externalizing-related processes. Current Study\nOur study sought to evaluate P3 and ERN amplitudes as indicators of broader vs. nar-\nrower dimensions of externalizing psychopathology and advance our understanding of the neurocognitive processes underlying externalizing-related reductions in these indicators. We used distinct variants of the P3 and ERN, extracted from three tasks administered to a relatively large sample also assessed for externalizing and internalizing problems. In line with the psychoneurometric approach to assessment (Patrick et al., 2013, 2019; Patrick & Hajcak, 2016), we sought to combine together sets of neurobiological indicators (i.e., ERN and P3 factors) and examine how these neurometric factors relate to a target psychological attribute (i.e., broad externalizing factor). In addition to addressing questions regarding diagnostic specificity and dimensionality, score aggregation is important when using ERP indicators because measures from different tasks are likely to contain method-specific variance separate from the target-construct related variance they share. This analytic plan corresponds with stages 3 and 4 of the psychoneurometric research strategy (Patrick et al., 2019), on which neurometric aggregates of neural indicators are created, and the psychological nature of such aggregated measures is clarified by assessing their predictive contributions to relevant criterion measures. Accordingly, we modeled internalizing and externalizing dimensions of HiTOP along with latent P3 and ERN factors and utilized these factors to test the following hypotheses:\n1 Models specified for a latent externalizing factor (defined using scale measures of effortful\ncontrol, antisocial behavior, and alcohol and other drug abuse) and distinct P3 and ERN\nFlanker-Threat, and Go/No-Go) will evidence acceptable fit (as per Burwell et al., 2016; Ribes-Guardiola et al., 2020).\n2 Based on previous factor analytic work suggesting that variants of the P3 and ERN load\nonto separate ERP factors indicative of distinct processes (Burwell et al., 2016; RibesGuardiola et al., 2020), we hypothesized that each ERP factor would show unique predictive relations with broad externalizing factor.\n3 Considering that P3 and ERN seem to operate as neurophysiological indicators of general\nsusceptibility to externalizing psychopathology (Lutz et al., 2021; Pasion & Barbosa, 2019; Patrick et al., 2006; Yancey et al., 2013), we predicted that specific problem dimensions loading onto the broad externalizing factor would not relate significantly to either ERP factor after accounting for the broad externalizing factor.\n4 Given that internalizing problems correlate positively with externalizing proneness (Caspi\net al., 2014; Caspi & Moffitt, 2018), we also performed some additional analyses for testing associations between the two ERP factors with internalizing psychopathology. Given the diversity of methods and findings for these ERPs across the internalizing spectrum (Macedo et al., 2021; Pasion & Barbosa, 2019; Saunders & Inzlicht, 2020), we did not have specific hypotheses for this domain and our analyses were exploratory in this regard.\nMethods\nData presented in this article are publicly available in (https://osf.io/hyjsf/).\nSample\nParticipants 18 years of age or older were recruited from the Portuguese community\nvia mailing lists and social media advertisements. Advertisements targeted common internalizing and externalizing symptoms to ensure adequate variability to effectively model these target psychopathology dimensions (Stanton et al., 2020; Van Dam et al., 2017). Limited exclusion criteria as follows were employed at the recruitment stage to optimize data quality:\ndeficits that could interfere with EEG.\nThe final sample included 182 participants (54% female) aged 18 to 60 (M = 30.1, SD\n= 9.84), with 15.2 years of formal education (SD = 3.38; range: 4-24 years). Fifty-one percent of participants reported having received a current or prior internalizing disorder diagnosis from a clinical specialist, and 31% reported experiencing one or more current or past externalizingrelated problem (e.g., substance abuse, criminal record). In addition, 26% of participants reported using psychiatric medication at the time of data collection, mainly antidepressants (89.7%) and anxiolytics (62.1%).\nThis study was approved by the local Ethics Committee, and all participants gave\ninformed consent. All procedures were conducted in a single session (2h00, approximately) and participants received a gift card (10\u20ac). The dataset published in this article are publicly available in (https://osf.io/hyjsf/). Self-report Measures\nThe Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI; Morey, 2004) measures several dimen-\nsions of personality and psychopathology (4-point Likert scale from \"Not true at all\u201d to \"Very true\"). Antisocial Behavior, Alcohol, and Drug Abuse subscales of the PAI were used to compute Externalizing scores. Total scores on the Effortful Control subscale (24 items, Likert scale from 1 \u2013 \u201cTotally false\u201d to 7 \u2013 \u201cTotally true) of the Adult Temperament Inventory (ATI; Evans & Rothbart, 2007) were employed as an additional Externalizing measure, to index variations in inhibitory control. Lower scores on this scale reflect deficits in effortful control, and thus higher impulsive tendencies.\nInternalizing subscales of the PAI \u2013 Depression, Anxiety, Posttraumatic Stress, Obses-\nsive-Compulsive, and Phobias \u2013 were used to model this psychopathology dimension in exploratory analyses of its relations with ERN and P3 factors. Lab-Behavioral Tasks\ning ERN responses while reducing fatigue effects in P3 measurement, each task finished at the end of the block whenever participants committed 20 errors (4 blocks, 240 trials). For all tasks, each trial (500 ms) was preceded by a fixation point (500 ms) and followed by a black screen during which the neuronal activity related to the response was recorded (800 ms). Stimuli were presented fully randomly.\nFlanker task \u2013 No-Threat. The arrowhead Flanker task (Eriksen & Eriksen, 1974)\ndisplays five horizontally aligned arrowheads in either congruent (\u2018\u2018<<<<<\u201d; 40%) or incongruent directions (\u2018<<><<\u201d; 60%). Participants were instructed to respond with the left or right button according to the direction of the central arrow (50% pointing to the right) as quickly as possible.\nFlanker task \u2013 Threat. A modified version of the arrowhead Flanker Task was ad-\nministered. It included a threat contingency for incorrect responses (Macedo et al., 2021; Pasion et al., 2018), consisting of an aversive white noise (50% probability) delivered within a random 5000-10000 ms interval following errors or omissions, succeeded by a black-silent display (1000 ms) to reduce punishment-related brain activity. During the punishment delay, an error-threat message [ERROR!] was presented in red.\nGo/No-Go task. Two letters (V and Y) were designated as the go (70%) and no-go\n(30%) stimuli. Letter assignment to the go and no-go conditions was counterbalanced across participants. Participants were instructed to respond to the go letter as quickly and accurately as possible and to inhibit responding to the no-go letter.\n[Figure 1]\nEEG Recording and Data Pre-Processing\nEEG was recorded using a 128-electrode Hydrocel Geodesic Sensor Net (Electrical\nGeodesics Inc., Oregon, USA). Data processing was conducted in EEGLAB V13.6.5b (Delorme & Makeig, 2004) and MATLAB 2017a (MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA) following procedures recommended by the Society of Psychophysiological Research (Keil et al., 2014).\nSection 1. ERP Data Analysis\nFor both stimulus-locked (P3) and response-locked (ERN, Correct-Related Negativity\n(CRN)) components, 1000 ms epochs (-200 ms baseline1) were extracted and averaged by condition (i.e., incongruent flankers and no-go trials for P3; errors and hit trials for responselocked components). Each of the tasks continued until participants had committed 20 response errors (calculated at the end of each block), ensuring that response-locked ERNs from each task incorporated a consistent number of data samples across participants. To also ensure consistency of data samples for the stimulus-locked P3s across tasks and participants, these ERPs were computed using data only from the first 240 trials of each task (i.e., block 1). Use of trials only from the first block also helped reduce the influence of task-duration factors such as fatigue and inattentiveness.\nThe selection of electrodes for quantifying the ERPs was based on prior research indi-\ncating a more anterior distribution for P3 in inhibitory control paradigms (Huster et al., 2013), and a frontocentral distribution for ERN (Gehring et al., 2012). As shown in Figure 2, P3 amplitudes were maximal at central electrodes (Cz cluster: E7, E31, E55, E80, E106, E129), and ERN amplitudes were maximal at frontocentral electrodes (FCz cluster: E5, E6, E7, E12, E13, E106, E112). These regions were used for quantifying P3 and ERN amplitudes, providing for consistency of measurement sites across tasks. Two independent raters analyzed the visual morphology of ERP by participant. Descriptive statistics for each brain region, missing data and the final number of trials included in the ERP averages are provided in the Supplementary Materials (Table S1).\n1 Following reviewers\u2019 suggestion, we conducted a control analysis testing for the consistency of results when using an ERN baseline period extending from -200 to -50ms (i.e., to remove timepoints close to 0 given the ERN can begin slightly before the execution of the motor response). Results remained virtually identical in all cases.\nwere defined around their peaks by averaging 6 time points (24 ms pre-peak - 24 ms postpeak) for each participant. Thus, P3 amplitudes from all conditions were extracted around the most positive peak within 250 to 550 ms (Ribes-Guardiola et al., 2020). ERN and CRN were quantified as the averaged activity around the most negative peaks for errors and hits, respectively (0 to 150 ms post-response; Pasion et al., 2018). Given prior evidence indicating that externalizing proneness relates specifically to error-related brain activity, but not to the counterpart activity elicited during correct trials, \u2013 i.e., CRN, putatively reflecting generic performance monitoring (Hall et al., 2007) \u2013 we isolated error-specific activity by computing residualized ERN scores (e.g., Meyer et al., 2017). Given the evidence for higher reliability of ERN residual scores as compared to subtraction-based difference scores (Sandre et al., 2020), separate linear regressions were performed for each task, with CRN and ERN amplitudes entered (respectively) as predictor and criterion, and residual scores were saved out to index error-specific brain activity (Meyer et al., 2017).\nThe internal consistency of P3 and ERN measures was computed using a split-half\napproach (odd and even-numbered trials; Spearman-Brown formula). Estimated reliabilities for these ERP measures ranged from .94 (P3) to .66 (ERN) (see Supplementary Material for details ).\n[Figure 2]"

First, score distribu-\ntions for study measures and ERP scores were screened for non-normality (i.e., skewness values between \u20132 and 2; kurtosis values between -3 and 3). The self-report measures pertaining to alcohol and drug use were found to exhibit mild to moderate non-normality. Therefore, primary analyses were conducted in Mplus version 8.4 using robust maximum likelihood\ntion for all other models. Missing data were handled using full information maximum likelihood (FIML).\nNext, a CFA was run to model relationships between the externalizing factor, residual\nERN components, and P3 components. The Antisocial Behavior, Alcohol Use, and Drug Abuse subscales of the PAI, along with the ATI Effortful Control scale, were used as indicators of the latent externalizing factor. Residualized ERN scores from the Flanker\u2013No-Threat, Flanker\u2013 Threat, and Go/No-Go tasks were employed as indicators of a residual ERN factor. Likewise, P3 scores from those same three served as indicators of a P3 factor. Given sex differences in psychopathology symptoms and brain-ERP scores (Eaton et al., 2012; Fischer et al., 2016; Hill et al., 2018; Larson et al., 2011; Melynyte et al., 2017), the externalizing and ERP factors were regressed onto participant sex2 to control for its effect in testing for the hypothesized associations. Model fit was evaluated using the Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), and standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) statistics. Fit was considered good if CFI and TLI values exceeded .95, and RMSEA and SRMR values were below .05\nFollowing specification of the joint CFA including the externalizing factor together with\nthe two ERP factors and participant sex, path models were run to examine the unique relationship of each ERP factor with the externalizing factor. In the first model (depicted in Figure 3), an additional pathway was specified in which the ERN factor was regressed onto the P3 factor. This model allowed for estimation of the association between the ERN factor and the externalizing factor after controlling for the variance shared between the ERN factor and the P3 factor.

We estimated total, direct, and indirect effects across the two levels of the dimensional hierarchy (i.e., higher-order HiTOP factors, and specific problem dimensions), allowing us to determine the degree to which variance in each ERP factor was best explained (i.e., statistically mediated) by the higher-order externalizing factor. Following Conway et al.\u2019 (2022), the rationale for the hierarchical mediation analyses was as follows: a) the total effect represents the zero-order correlation between variables, b) the direct effect calculates the extent to each individual indicator of externalizing relate to ERP factors, above and beyond any higher-order constructs, and c) the indirect effect reflects, in turn, the proportion of the association between variables that are mediated by higher-order constructs. As such, each mediation model was evaluated in terms of the indirect effect of the ERP factor on each specific indicator of externalizing via the externalizing factor.\nIn one set of hierarchical mediation analyses, the ERN factor was first regressed onto\nthe P3 factor, after which each indicator of externalizing (antisocial behavior, alcohol use, drug abuse, and effortful control) was individually regressed onto the ERN factor along with the externalizing factor.

For latent externalizing, standardized loadings for the antisocial behavior, alcohol use, drug abuse, and effortful control subscales were large and well-balanced (\u03bbs = 0.85, 0.64, 0.69, and -.57 respectively, ps < .001). For the ERN factor, standardized loadings for each task were also well balanced (\u03bbs = 0.84, 0.73, and .67, ps < .001). Similarly for the latent P3 factor, standardized loadings for each of the three tasks were fairly balanced (\u03bbs = 0.91, 0.86, and .61, ps < .001). Hypothesis 2: Unique Associations of ERN and P3 with the Broad Externalizing Factor\nTo investigate the unique relationship of each ERP factor with the externalizing factor,\npath models were run to isolate this association when controlling for the variance shared between the ERN and P3 factors. These analyses revealed that after regressing the ERN factor onto the P3 factor, the covariance of the ERN factor with externalizing was significant (\u03c8 = .21 [CI 95%: .019; .395], p = .031). Likewise, after controlling for variance shared with the ERN factor, the covariance of the P3 factor with the externalizing factor was also significant (\u03c8 = - .27 [CI 95%: -.420; -.111], p = .001). These results indicate that the ERN and P3 are each uniquely related to externalizing (Figures 3 and 4), with amplitudes in each case reduced (i.e., ERN less negative, and P3 less positive) as a function of higher externalizing.3\n3 Our approach of testing for the unique association between each ERP factor and Externalizing was based on evidence indicating that stimulus-related activity (P3) that overlaps with responserelated activity (ERN) can suppress \u2013 or account for \u2013 associations of the ERN with psychopathology (see Klawhon et al., 2020; Meyer et al., 2017). Covariance paths in the latent measurement model of ERN, P3 and Externalizing indicated that, without controlling for the ERN factor, the P3 factor was significantly associated with externalizing (\u03c8 = -.24, p = .003), whereas the association between the ERN factor and externalizing fell short of significance (\u03c8 = .17, p =\n[Figure 4]\nHypothesis 3: Hierarchical Mediation Analyses: Specific Symptom/Trait Indicators of the Externalizing factor\nHierarchical mediation analyses were used to examine the degree to which observed\nrelations of the ERN and P3 factors with the individual indicators of the externalizing factor could be accounted for by the externalizing factor. For each symptom or trait indicator of externalizing, the direct effect represents the extent to which ERP factors relate to one indicator independently of the common factor reflecting its covariance with other indicators. That is, it indexes the unique (residual) association of each latent ERP variable with each diagnostic indicator after accounting for its relationship to the broad externalizing factor.\nAs shown in Table 1, the majority of the total-effect association of the P3 factor with\neach diagnostic indicator was accounted for by the shared externalizing factor \u2013 and none of the individual indicators showed a significant direct-effect association with P3 (ps = .187 to .854). In the case of the ERN factor, a somewhat larger portion of indicator-specific variance accounted for its total-effect association with two of the diagnostic indicators \u2013 alcohol abuse and effortful control \u2013 but even in these cases, the direct effects for each were nonsignificant (ps = .059 and .149). These results indicate that much of the relationship between ERN and P3 factors with each indicator of the externalizing dimension was accounted for by their shared factor. Exploratory Analyses: ERN, P3, and the broad Internalizing Factor\nIn order to evaluate the relations between the ERN and P3 factors with internalizing\npsyhcopathology, analogous CFAs were run to test for associations of the residual-ERN and\n.100). These comparative results of analyses for each ERP factor controlling for the other indicate the presence of a cooperative suppressor effect for ERP factor in its association with the externalizing factor, and indicate that accounting for externalizing-related reductions in P3 amplitudes is important when examining associations of the ERN with externalizing symptom dimensions.\nceptably, \u03c72(49) = 119.3, p < .001, CFI = .92, TLI = .89, RMSEA = .09 [CI 90%: .069, .109], SRMR = .06. The standardized loadings for ERN and P3 factors were extremely similar to those reported for the externalizing model. For the latent internalizing factor, standardized loadings for the anxiety, phobias, depression, and posttraumatic stress scales were similarly high (\u03bbs = 0.90, 0.75, 0.80, 0.79, respectively, ps < .001). However, the loading for the obsessive-compulsive scale was smaller (\u03bb = 0.42, p < .001). After controlling for variance shared with the P3 factor, the covariance between the ERN factor and the internalizing factor was not significant (\u03c8 = .10, [CI 95%: -.082; .050], p = .295). Similarly, after the P3 factor was regressed onto the ERN factor, the covariance between the P3 factor and the internalizing factor was not significant (\u03c8 = -.12, [CI 95%: -.281; .272], p = .171). Thus, associations evident for ERN and P3 with general externalizing proneness were not observed for the broad internalizing factor.\nDiscussion\nResearch on neurophysiological indicators of externalizing problems such as P3 and\nERN has been dominated by single-disorder studies, without consideration of shared and unique dimensions of psychopathology (Krueger et al., 2021). HiTOP invites researchers to test for neurobiological correlates at different levels of a hierarchical organization of psychopathology, in which narrower symptom and trait dimensions build up to broader comorbidity dimensions (DeYoung et al., 2022; Forbes et al., 2021; Kotov et al., 2017; Ruggero et al., 2019). Working from a HiTOP perspective, this study sought to clarify the status of two RDoC neurophysiological indicators of externalizing psychopathology \u2013 P3 and ERN \u2013, at broader versus narrower levels of its hierarchical organization. We further tested whether these ERPs index a common externalizing-related process or separate neurocognitive processes. Neural Measures and Symptom Granularity: Brain ERPs as Indicators of Broader vs. Narrow Psychopathology Dimensions\nERN and P3 factors independently predicted variations in general externalizing prone-\nness (when accounting for their associations with sex), highlighting that these ERPs operate\ndiation analyses indicated that no individual indicator (i.e., antisocial, alcohol, or drug symptoms; effortful control) related significantly to either ERP factor when accounting for general externalizing scores. Collectively, these results indicate that ERN and P3 represent transdiagnostic rather than condition-specific biomarkers of externalizing psychopathology.\nConverging with the work of Patrick et al. (2006), our findings reveal that broad exter-\nnalizing factor accounted for the majority (i.e., 58% - 100%) of the total effect relationship of each specific diagnostic indicator with the P3 factor. This is also consistent with prior twin studies reporting a common genetic basis for the association between externalizing proneness and the P3 (Hicks et al., 2007; Yancey et al., 2013). Critically, research has reported associations between blunted P3 amplitude in adolescence and the development of externalizing problems in adulthood (Iacono et al., 2003). Therefore, reduced P3 seems to operate as a riskliability indicator of general proneness to externalizing problems.\nReduced ERN amplitude is less well established as an indicator of externalizing psy-\nchopathology (Krueger et al., 2021), and previous meta-analytic work yielded little evidence of specificity in its relations with externalizing problems (Lutz et al., 2021; Pasion & Barbosa, 2019). In this regard, our results evidence that blunted ERN operates as an indicator of common externalizing proneness. Furthermore, our finding that reduced ERN covaried with the externalizing factor separately from reduced P3 suggests that these two ERP measures index separate neural processes related to impulse control problems. We will return to this point in the next section.\nTo assess the specificity of the associations between externalizing and ERP factors,\nwe also performed analyses for general internalizing problems, modeled using scale measures of anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive, trauma, and phobic disorders as indicators. No evidence was found for a significant association of either ERP factor with the internalizing dimension \u2013 indicating that reduced amplitudes of these two neural measures in the current study were specifically indicative of general externalizing proneness. Previous meta-analytic\nERN (e.g., Pasion & Barbosa, 2019; Saunders & Inzlicht, 2020). For example, enhanced rather than reduced ERN has been reported in relation to internalizing-related symptoms of ruminative worry (Moser et al., 2013) and error sensitivity (Meyer, 2022). Moreover, it has been suggested that reduced P3 operates as a state marker (i.e., evident within active episodes only) of certain internalizing conditions such as depression, rather than as a risk indicator (Yanai et al., 1997). More research is needed to clarify which symptom features of internalizing psychopathology (e.g., anhedonia, rumination, worry) relate most to ERN and P3, and the extent to which observed associations reflect active versus latent risk.\nOf note, our null findings for P3 in relation to internalizing psychopathology appear at\nodds with results from a study by Bernat et al. (2020), which reported associations for two variants of oddball-task P3 with internalizing as well as externalizing symptoms. However, in contrast with the current study, these authors operationalized internalizing psychopathology as a composite of just two measures, a normative anxiety scale and a depressive symptom scale, and the variance in the internalizing dimension that related to P3 amplitude was that shared with externalizing proneness, as indexed by a more comprehensive measure of this latter problem domain (Krueger et al., 2007). Symptom Dimensions and Neural-Systems Granularity: P3 and ERN as Indicators of Distinct Externalizing-related Processes\nA notable feature of the current study is that it: 1) included multiple indicators of each\nERP allowing for a latent representation of each neural process, and 2) focused on two distinct ERPs of interest, P3 and ERN. This approach aligns with calls for RDoC-oriented research to characterize patterns of covariance among different neural indicators of clinical symptom dimensions in order to gain insights into the functional basis of their relations with psychopathology (Patrick & Hajcak, 2016; Patrick, Iacono, & Venables, 2019). To the extent separate neural indicators overlap in their associations with a given psychopathology dimension, it can be inferred that they tap a common psychopathological process; to the extent\nof variance in it), they can be presumed to tap distinct psychopathological processes.\nOur data revealed that latent ERN and P3 factors covaried only modestly (see Figures\n3 and 4) and exhibited independent associations with the broad externalizing factor. The implication is that nonoverlapping elements of the ERN and P3 accounted for separate portions of variance in general externalizing proneness \u2013 indicating that they tap distinctive neural and neurocognitive processes contributing to this general propensity. What might these distinctive processes consist of? Evidence from source localization and EEG-fMRI studies indicates that the ERN is principally generated by structures in the medial frontal cortex that are linked to attentional control and detection of response conflict (Dehaene et al., 1994; Herrmann et al., 2004; Iannaccone et al., 2015; van Veen & Carter, 2002). The P3, on the other hand, arises from widely distributed brain sources, including temporal and parietal areas believed to be involved in elaborative processing and context updating (Dien et al., 2003; Polich, 2007).\nConsidered in this light, ERN\u2019s association with general externalizing proneness may\nreflect the impaired engagement of unconscious, frontally-driven control mechanisms under conditions where the intended response does not match the executed response. P3\u2019s relationship with the externalizing factor, by contrast, may be indicative of reduced elaborative post-processing of motivational-salient events and/or impaired updating of internal representations of such events (for reviews, see: Gratton et al., 2018; Ullsperger et al., 2014). Impairments in each of these processes may increase the risk for persistent harmful behaviors characteristic of high-externalizing individuals (Patrick & Bernat, 2009; Patterson & Newman, 1993).\nIt should be noted that P3 and ERN differed somewhat in their patterns of association\nwith broader versus narrower dimensions of externalizing symptomatology. As noted in the preceding section, P3\u2019s associations with all four specific diagnostic indicators were mostly accounted for by the broad externalizing factor. By contrast, broad externalizing predominantly accounted for ERN\u2019s association with only two of the four diagnostic indicators: antisocial\ntrait effortful control, the greater part of their total-effect relations with blunted ERN response (59.7% and 57.2%, respectively) were accounted for by variance specific to each (i.e., separate from the broad externalizing factor). These results must be regarded as tentative, given that the specific (i.e., indirect) effects for these two indicators fell below significance, but they have intriguing implications that warrant follow-up investigation. In line with the foregoing interpretation, variants of the ERN may index a distinct process especially indicative of susceptibility to, or consequences of, alcohol use. Indeed, there is evidence that impairments in cognitive control relate both to familial risk for alcoholism (Pihl et al., 1990) and sustained excessive use of alcohol (Malone et al., 2021). Further research with more robust measures of problematic alcohol use is needed to effectively evaluate the possibility that ERN response taps a process that is specifically sensitive to alcohol-related impairments in control capacity.\nMore broadly, our results highlight how systematically studying covariance patterns\namong different neurophysiological indicators, and their converging and diverging relations with symptom dimensions at differing levels of the HiTOP model, can help to elucidate the nature of processes contributing to broader and narrower psychopathological phenotypes. In the same way that factor analytic research on clinical symptomatology has served to delineate distinctive dimensions of psychopathology, the application of structural modeling methods to neural indicators can help to delineate clear dimensions of neurocognitive functioning to broad and narrower clinical phenotypes. Systematic work of this kind can provide a means for effectively characterizing the nature of neural processes contributing to clinical phenomena that can feed back in turn to the HiTOP nosological system. Limitations and Future Directions\nSome limitations of the current work warrant mention. First, and although our\nrecruitment strategy targeted common internalizing and externalizing problems to ensure variability on these dimensions, the sample was recruited from the general population. Future studies oversampling individuals exhibiting clinical levels of both current internalizing and\nalso be noted that structural equation modeling requires larger sample sizes. Therefore, our hierarchical results need to be interpreted with caution given limits of statistical power. Considering that EEG data collection sessions are highly time-consuming, an international multicentric effort would be required to achieve larger sample sizes.\nAnother limitation is that our study focused only on P3 and ERN, but other ERPs can\nbe highly informative as well. For example, reduced ERP responses to fear-face stimuli (N170, P2) have been found to be related to callousness, but not disinhibitory traits (Brislin et al., 2018; Palumbo et al., 2020). Moreover, research examining neural responses to substance-related cues \u2013 such as the alcohol-cue P3 (Bartholow et al., 2007) \u2013 might bear more relevance to understanding neural processes (e.g., incentive salience) involved in the emergence, or stages of current manifest symptomatology, of substance-related problems.\nA more detailed characterization of the HiTOP hierarchy would also be needed. Alt-\nhough the scales employed in the current work captured a range of clinical symptoms, we were not able to model HiTOP in full. Follow-up studies using a wider range of candidate measures to effectively model narrower and higher-order dimensions of the HiTOP system are required (see Simms et al., 2022, for a description of multi-level symptom scales under development). For instance, it should be noted that ERN and P3 amplitude reductions have also been linked to schizophrenia and psychotic disorders (see Castro et al., 2019; Ford, 1999; Martin et al., 2019) \u2013 conditions subsumed by a separate thought disorder spectrum within the HiTOP system. Further research is needed to clarify overlap versus distinctiveness in the mechanisms underlying P3 and ERN amplitude reductions in psychotic as compared to externalizing disorders.\nFurther research is also needed to clarify the nature of associations of P3 and ERN\nwith internalizing psychopathology at finer-grained levels, given that we did not find associations of either ERP factor with general internalizing vulnerability. While our null findings might conceivably be attributable to insufficient sample size, it is also possible that\ngeneral. Recent evidence indicates, for example, that ERP modulation may relate more to symptom manifestations of internalizing at lower levels of the HiTOP hierarchy (e.g., anhedonia, worry, rumination, error sensitivity) than to general proneness to internalizing problems (Bruder et al., 2002; Klawohn et al., 2020; Macedo et al., 2021; Moser et al., 2013; Santopetro et al., 2022; Saunders & Inzlicht, 2020).\nA final limitation of the current study is its cross-sectional design. Longitudinal and twin\nstudies would be required to better disentangle whether P3 and ERN neurometric composites index causal risk factors (see Perkins et al., 2020, for an in-depth discussion). Longitudinal studies could also examine distinct developmental trajectories considering the ERN and P3 as separate risk factors for externalizing problems. Conclusion\nIn summary, we used data for different variants of ERN and P3 response to evaluate\nthese neurophysiological measures as indicators of general vs. specific propensities toward externalizing psychopathology. Our findings highlight not only that reduced ERN and P3 responses as indicators of a general externalizing factor, but also that these associations are indicative of distinct neural processes pertinent to externalizing proneness.\nThe current work illustrates how the application of a psychoneurometric approach to\nthe study of clinical phenomena at different levels of the HiTOP system can help to advance knowledge of the role of neural processes in symptom expression and feed back into an understanding of the bases of diagnostic nosology.\nBartholow, B.
