1. **Investigate the role of social networks and peer influence on farmers' adaptation decisions.** The current study focuses on individual learning, but social networks and peer influence can also play a significant role in shaping farmers' decisions. Future research could explore how these factors interact with individual learning to influence adaptation outcomes.


2. **Examine the impact of different types of extreme events on farmers' adaptation decisions.** The current study considers only one type of extreme event (drought), but farmers may respond differently to different types of events (e.g., floods, heat waves, or wildfires). Future research could investigate how the type of extreme event affects farmers' adaptation decisions and the effectiveness of different adaptation strategies.


3. **Explore the role of government policies and programs in supporting farmers' adaptation efforts.** The current study does not explicitly consider the role of government policies and programs in supporting farmers' adaptation efforts. Future research could investigate how these policies and programs can be designed to most effectively promote adaptation, considering both the economic and environmental costs and benefits.


4. **Assess the long-term sustainability of adaptation strategies.** The current study focuses on the short-term impacts of adaptation strategies, but it is important to consider their long-term sustainability. Future research could investigate how adaptation strategies affect the long-term productivity and resilience of agricultural systems, as well as their environmental impacts.


5. **Develop decision-support tools to help farmers adapt to climate change.** The findings of this study could be used to develop decision-support tools to help farmers adapt to climate change. These tools could provide farmers with information on the potential impacts of climate change on their farms, as well as guidance on how to develop and implement effective adaptation strategies.
