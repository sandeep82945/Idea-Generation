    "abstractText": "hargaff\u2019s second parity rule (PR-2), where the comlementary base and k-mer contents are matching ithin the same strand of a double stranded DNA dsDNA), is a phenomenon that invited many explaations. The strict compliance of nearly all nuclear sDNA to PR-2 implies that the explanation should lso be similarly adamant. In this work, we revisited he possibility of mutation rates driving PR-2 complince . Star ting from the assumption-free approach, e constructed kinetic equations for unconstrained imulations. The results were analysed for their PR-2 ompliance by employing symbolic regression and ac hine learning tec hniques. We arrived to a genralised set of mutation rate interrelations in place n most species that allow for their full PR-2 comliance . Impor tantl y, our constraints e xplain PR-2 n genomes out of the scope of the prior explanaions based on the equilibration under mutation rates ith simpler no-strand-bias constraints. We thus renstate the role of mutation rates in PR-2 through its olecular core, now shown, under our f orm ulation, o be tolerant to pre viousl y noted strand biases and ncomplete compositional equilibration. We further nvestigate the time for any genome to reach PR-2, howing that it is generally earlier than the composiional equilibrium, and well within the age of life on arth. i o s i u t a k o 2",

In 1968, Chargaff separated the strands of the acillus subtilis genome into individual strands and discovred that the same sets of identities found for a doubletranded DN A (dsDN A) in PR-1 also hold true on each ndividual strand of the same molecule, i.e. the amounts f bases are equal in G / C and A / T pairs in each separate trand of a dsDN A as well, form ulated as the second party rule (PR-2) ( 3 , 4 ). This observation holds true almost ni v ersally across e xtant genomes and has e v en been e xended to the frequency of higher-order oligonucleotides nd their re v erse complements, where the quantity of each -mer is equal to the quantity of the re v erse complement f that k-mer in the same strand (known as extended PR) ( 5\u201310 ).

Being somewhat less clear from the structural and mechanistic considerations of DNA, PR-2 is very robust, hence requires an explanation that is as \u201ccrystal clear\u201d and limiting as the Watson\u2013Crick base pairing is for the PR-1. Howe v er, re vie wing the scientific literature, an agreed consensus for the exact cause of Chargaff\u2019s second parity rule has not yet been determined. The current hypotheses behind PR-2 can be grouped into two schools of thought: intrastrand symmetry is (i) a feature of evolutionary convergence, and (ii) a feature of the primordial genome. To the best of our knowledge, the sub-categories of explanations are the following: (a) no strand biases for mutation and selection ( 6 , 14 ); selecti v e pr essur e f or the f ormation of stemloop structures ( 15 , 16 ); statistics-based approaches ( 17\u201319 ); maximum entropy with the double helix constraints ( 9 ); strand in version / in verted transposition / duplication of dsDNA f ollowed by in version ( 13 , 20 , 21 ); (b) original features of the primordial genome (as opposed to a feature of evolutionary convergence) ( 22 ).\nHere, we start by re-examining the tolerance in genomic compliance to Chargaff\u2019s PR-2 in three kingdoms of species. Re vie wing the major e xplanations proposed so far, we then adopt a completely assumption-free approach to find any possible link between mutation rate constants and PR-2. We demonstrate the contributory role of the equalities of mutation rates in dsDNA that are intrinsically present owing to its complementary double-stranded na ture. Showing tha t, overall, these equalities hold true at a large scale, for at least the human genome, adding a weight on the no-strand-bias (NSB) assumption for PR-2, we also note a substantial variation allowed for the mutation rate constants around the paired equalities. Further examination coupled with symbolic r egr ession and machine learning, leads us to a set of equations that define the universal and more permissive constraints on mutation rates. We demonstrate the better concordance of our equations with the experimental outcomes of genomes both compliant and non-compliant with NSB-dri v en equilibrium. Furthermore, we elaborate on the evolutionary convergence of genomes to PR-2, explaining why all dsDNA-based life complies with PR-2 at its present snapshot on Earth. The presented work reinstates the mutation rates as the major dri v ers behind the emergence of PR-2 e v en with strand biases in mutation rates and with an out-of-compositionalequilibrium state. This work demonstrates the simple principles behind the complex question and can serve as an important basis for future molecular evolution studies in genomics.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nGeneral notes on the performed calculations\nThe de v eloped wor kflows and analyses in this study employ ed the R progr amming language ( https://www.rproject.org/ ). The r esour ce-demanding computations wer e performed on a local Linux-based computing cluster at MRC WIMM, Uni v ersity of Oxfor d, by using nodes with 3 \u00d7 2.7 GHz 8-core E5-2680 Intel Xeon processors and\n256 GB random access memory. The analytical derivations and checks have been done via the Ma thema tica software ( https://www.wolfram.com/ma thema tica ). The server a pplication (GenomicPR2SimsWebA pp) was written in R, using the Shiny library ( https://cran.r-project. org/package=shiny ) and a server application ( https://shiny. rstudio.com ). Figur es wer e cr eated with the R base, ggplot2 ( https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org ) and gridExtra ( https:// cr an.r-project.org/package=gridExtr a ) libr aries. Handling of the datasets was done by using the R base and tidyverse ( https://cr an.r-project.org/package=tidyverse ) libr aries.\nProcessing of the eukary otic, prokary otic and DN A virus species\nWe hav e e xamined ov er 8000 genome sequences ranging from eukary otes, prokary otes, and DNA viruses. We accessed the Ensembl Genomes database via FTP ( ftp:// ftp .ensemblgenomes .or g ) and do wnloaded all genome sequences from, at the time of performing this work, the latest release for bacteria ( ftp://ftp .ensemblgenomes .org/pub/ bacteria/release-48 ) and eukaryotes ( ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/ pub/release-102/fasta/ ). For DNA viruses, we accessed the NCBI data base ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/la bs/virus/ vssi/#/find-data/virus ) and downloaded all species categorised as \u201cDNA viruses\u201d. For the bacteria and eukaryotes, we downloaded the genome sequences in an iterati v e process via the R code. We used the Biostrings ( https: //bioconductor.org/packages/Biostrings/ ) library to calculate the nucleotide composition for all three kingdoms (Supplementary Figure S1). We note that a significant number of sequences had to be removed because of, for instance, duplicates of a gi v en strain of a gi v en species. Taking prokaryotes as an example, there were a pproximatel y 44,000 species in the original file from the Ensembl database, but we noticed that a single species could have thousands of entries in the file which would skew the species-wide analysis and yield inaccurate results. The same problem also occurred with eukaryotes and DNA viruses. Thus, the goal was to filter the files with the following methodology: in a group of species with the same name, we only saved the first occurring row of the gi v en species name and repeat this process for the remainder. At the end of this process, we discarded many duplicates and filtered the data as consistently as we could, including manual filtering processes. Full details are on the corresponding GitHub repository.\nProcessing of the human and chimpanzee genomes\nAnalyses involving the human genome were performed using the unmasked version of the human r efer ence sequence hg19 / GRCh37, as accessed from Ensembl ( 23 ) genome database ( www.ensembl.org ). We used the unmasked chimpanzee genome, version 2.1.4.75, for calculating the genomic base and dyad contents (Supplementary Note S1). The fasta files were downloaded from the Ensembl da tabase. W hile also trying the masked genome, we noted only negligible differences on both single base and dyad contents. For counting dyads, both segmentation (into dimers) and sliding window methods were used, again with no significant differences noted.\nM\nT b ( v g s o w c H D c w i o o t q p f t t e t t t o o a s\nG\nT g r d r d m t p l p o s p p\nD\nS c c f w d ( v c\n( o t c m e d w a o v\nR\nT s\nT P g f a e e t t 1 1 p o i t k p m t e\nt i t u a t t C e a i o F r 1 o s \u00d7 t\nA\nO P\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/51/14/7409/7192623 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nutation rate constants for use in simulations\nhe mutation rate constants used in this work were all r ought fr om pre vious wor k using the Trek methodology 24 ), where the human genome muta tion ra tes were reealed through the remnants of LINE-1 elements in a sinle genome manner. We also re-calculated such rate contants using LINE-1 elements that reside in only +, and in nly -, strands to arri v e at strand-specific but still genomeide overall values for mutation rates. Strand-symmetry acounted for mutation frequencies for the following species: omo sapiens , Esc heric hia coli , Caenorhabditis elegans , rosophila melanogaster, Aotus thaliana and Saccharomyces erevisiae were obtained from ( 25 ). All such frequencies ere next brought into a scale of our rate constants for use n our simulation models. In the supplementary materials f ( 24 ), Supplementary Figure S3 shows the relationship f the mutation rate constants for the human genome obained with the Trek methodology versus the mutation freuencies reported from other datasets. We replicated Suplementary Figure S3a ( 24 ) with the obtained frequencies rom other species and the muta tion ra te constants from he Trek methodology and performed a linear r egr ession hr ough the zer o origin. This resulted in the k = 2 . 831 f quation. As w e w er e inter ested in the genomic average mua tion ra te constants in a time domain, we used an assumpion that this quantitati v e relationship between the mutaion rate constants and mutation frequencies holds for the ther (non-human) fiv e species. Thus , the frequency values , btained from the literatur e, wer e used as inputs ( f ) in the bove equation to generate the average mutation rate contants ( k ) in the time domain for our simulation.\neneration of simulations\nhe numerical analyses were performed using the R proramming language with its deSolve library ( https://cran. -project.org/package=deSolve ) for solving the system of if ferential equa tions. Random sampling of the muta tion ate constants for the continuous uniform distribution was one with the runif() function, and the truncated noral distribution was done with the rtruncnorm() funcion from the truncnorm library ( https://cran.r-project.org/ ackage=truncnorm ). All simulations were run in paralel execution using the foreach() ( https://cran.r-project.org/ ackage=foreach ) and doParallel() ( https://cran.r-project. rg/package=doParallel ) functions. For reproducibility, we et the initial seed to 1 and used the doRNG ( https://cran.rroject.org/package=doRNG ) library for the parallel child rocesses in our foreach loops.\nefining the equilibration time periods\nimulation of the replicates was done using symmetryonstr ained mutation r ate constants dr awn from a trunated normal distribution using the rtruncnorm() function rom the truncnorm library in R. Where the equilibrium as needed, we carried out the following fiv e-step process to efine a genome equilibr ation toler ance for the simulation: A) calculate the sum of the differences of base contents diided by four; (B) repeat the simulation 100,000 times; (C) alculate the mean fluctuation of (A) for the 100,000 times;\nD) check that the mean fluctuation is not greater than 1% f 25 of the mean fluctua tions tha t we define as the EQolerance; (E) calculate the absolute difference of each base ontent and find the difference between the maximum and inimum. When this time is less than or equal to the EQtolrance, the genome was considered equilibrated. Indepenently from the equilibration compliance, PR-2 compliance as defined as the time when both the C GC versus C AT skew re below their respecti v e tolerance values obtained for each f the three kingdoms: eukary otes, prokary otes, and DNA iruses, as discussed below.\nESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nhe universality of PR-2 in dsDNA genomes of different pecies\nhe re-examination of the uni v ersal nature of the Chargaff\u2019s R-2 compliance of dsDNA on an up-to-date collection of enomes is shown in Figure 1 A, where we bring the plots or C GC versus C AT skews, as defined by (G \u2013 C) / (G + C) nd (A \u2013 T) / (A + T), for the genomes of species across the ukary otes, prokary otes, and DNA viruses. Strong adhernce to PR-2 can be noted in all kingdoms (Figure 1 A) with he intr a-str and symmetry phenomenon holding true across he extant dsDNA genomes (standard deviations: 1.908 \u00d7 0 \u22123 , 1.907 \u00d7 10 \u22122 , 9.666 \u00d7 10 \u22122 for C GC , and 1.178 \u00d7 0 \u22123 , 9.400 \u00d7 10 \u22123 , 1.041 \u00d7 10 \u22121 for C AT across eukaryotes, rokaryotes and DNA viruses, respecti v ely), e xcept for the rganelle and other ssDNA genomes ( 7\u201310 ). While focusng on the low-density scatter in the C GC and C AT skews, he viral DNA genomes are narrowly spread, while the euaryotic organisms form a dense and localised cluster. In rokaryotes, the low-density scatter in the plots is not only or e diffuse, as compar ed to eukaryotes, but there seems o be an emerging diagonal pattern, linked, based upon our xperimentations, with the G+C content of a genome.\nBased on these plots, we can infer the allowed PR-2 flucuations for each of the three kingdoms. This allows the defnition of \u201ctolerance\u201d values for PR-2 compliance, essenial for our further studies. We examined the tolerance vales from the C GC and C AT skews as opposed to the C G / C nd C A / T ratios (see Supplementary Figure S2), because, in he former case, the range of allowed values is limited beween [ 0 , 1 ] while the ma thema tical na ture of the C G / C and A / T ratios allow a biased range from [ 0 , \u221e ] . The preferntial regions of PR-2 compliance were defined from the nalysed experimental genomes for each kingdom, by takng the mean value of the skews (usually tending to 0) and ne standard deviation allowed at both sides of the mean. or C GC skews, the PR2-compliant pr efer ential fluctuation egions wer e 7.780 \u00d7 10 \u22125 \u00b1 1.908 \u00d7 10 \u22123 , 1.425 \u00d7 10 \u22124 \u00b1 .907 \u00d7 10 \u22122 and 2.262 \u00d7 10 \u22122 \u00b1 9.666 \u00d7 10 \u22122 for eukarytes, prokaryotes and DNA viruses respecti v ely.

In 1995, Sueoka determined that, when there is no bias in mutation and selection between the complementary strands, base mutation may explain the parity phenomenon ( 14 ). For instance, for a C \u2192 T mutation in one strand of a dsDNA under NSB, the rate for the C \u2192 T mutation on the other, complementary, strand can be considered the same. Due to the first parity rule, C \u2192 T mutation leads to a G \u2192 A mutation on the complementary strand. Ther efor e, the C \u2192 T and G \u2192 A muta tion ra tes ma tch on the same strand too, since G \u2192 A mutation is the same C \u2192 T mutation on the complementary strand, and the rates of C \u2192 T mutations on both strands match under NSB. As a result, a mutation network of 12 unique mutation rates can be simplified down to only six independent rates ( 14 ). In the same year, Lobry deri v ed a set of differential equations that showed tha t, a t equilibrium, the base frequencies within each strand are equal, i.e. resulting in PR-2 ( 6 ). While a mutation network with NSB was a working hypothesis by both Sueoka and Lobry, it was shortly afterwards rejected by Lo-\nbry because the equations assume that both the mutation rates and the resultant genomes are constantly at equilibrium. It suggests that any deviation from PR-2 could either mean that the model is wrong or that the system is out of equilibrium. Considering known examples of genomes being out of equilibrium ( 26\u201328 ), as well as mutational processes bearing some strand asymmetries ( 29 ), this hypothesis cannot be the uni v ersal e xplanation for PR-2 ( 27 , 28 ). While Sueoka and Lobry used a base-mutation model to explain the cause of PR-2, in the same year, Forsdyke proposed that PR-2 is a product of selecti v e pr essur e favouring point muta tions tha t assist in the formation of stemloops ( 15 , 16 ). He argued that such formations may be advantageous for recombination e v ents, thus playing an important role in driving the symmetry between complementary oligonucleotides. Howe v er, similar to Sueoka and Lobry, Forsdyke\u2019s hypothesis has also been challenged. Zhang et al. suggested that most oligonucleotides (with sequence lengths of fiv e and longer) do not have a reverse complement nearby in the genome sequence and thus the short-range\nc t l (\na e g h a g m c t g t H i q c c p o H b o l ( e b t T D c b n h s p\ne d t s o m H i b D e l w s t g d t m p q\nv l t p t n i e a t s l f i t o u c e q s i t s\nw o c g g p b e w f q f t i\nA t\nO t a t o e a l s t s e o ( w d u s\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/51/14/7409/7192623 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nontribution of local stem-loop potential by complemenary oligonucleotides is limited ( 30 ). Chen et al. also chalenged the stem-loop hypothesis for human chromosomes 31 ).\nAlbrecht-Buehler proposed that PR-2 is the ine vitab le, symptotic product of the cumulati v e action of proposdly e v er-repeated inv ersions and inv erted transpositions in enomes ( 20 , 21 ). He extended his inversion / transposition ypothesis by observing that these mechanisms also generted a uni v ersal triplet profile for most of the evolving oranisms, i.e. the frequency of triplet oligonucleotides is alost equal to the frequency of their re v erse-complement, in ompliance with the extended PR-2. He further explained hat the evolutionary advantage of an almost universal enome may be to help with horizontal gene transfer beween species that are vastly different from one another. owe v er, the biological plausibility of such e v er-repeated nversions in the present limited evolutionary timescale is uestionable, and it is known that the point mutations ocur at an order of magnitude mor e fr equently than canonial indels ( 32 , 33 ). Thus, if PR-2 can be explained based on oint muta tions, tha t explana tion should have precedence ver the explanation based on a specific subtype of indels. is conclusions from this paper have also been challenged\ny Zhang et al. who found that at least among prokarytic genomes, two common triplet profiles existed, one for\now-G+C and the other for high-G+C content genomes 34 ). Similar to Albrecht-Buehler\u2019s hypothesis, Okamura t al. proposed that in versions, which ma y or may not e preceded by duplications, may be a major contributor o the phenomenon of the intr a-str and parity rule ( 13 ). hey found that when subjecting the human mitochondrial NA to inversions in silico , the frequencies of specific trinuleotides and their re v erse complementary oligonucleotides ecame broadly symmetrical, suggesting that this mechaism could lead a sequence to parity. It is worthy to note, owe v er, that the biological and mechanistic plausibility of uch repeated inversions and transpositions as a widespread henomenon in genomes remains to be confirmed. Se v eral scientists have used statistics-based approaches to xplain the cause of PR-2. For instance, Baisn \u0301ee et al. ( 7 ) emonstra ted tha t using simple, first-order Markov models o model biological sequences was not enough to explain ymmetries in dsDNA genomes. Instead, the emergence f symmetry may be explained through a combination of echanisms , such as inversions , among other possibilities. art et al. ( 17 ) showed that the Gibbs distribution, which s associated with the re v erse complementary relationship etween the nucleotide interactions on each strand of dsNA, can explain PR-2. An observation made by Shporer t al. ( 8 ) showed that when we consider a genome of a gi v en ength L , then the highest k-mer (substrings of length k ) for hich PR-2 holds true is gi v en by 0.7ln( L ), thereby demontra ting tha t the extended PR-2 rule holds true up to a cerain length of a k-mer. Howe v er, their observation has been eneralised in a recent paper by Fariselli et al. ( 9 ), which oes not impose an upper limit to the k-mer length for he PR-2 to hold true. They proposed a solution using the aximum entropy with the double helix constraints, which\nredicts that at equilibrium, in a long-enough dsDNA seuence, the probability of occurrence of a k-mer and its re-\nerse complement tend to be the same. In other words, the eading force shaping the symmetrical DNA duplex strucure is r andomness, r ather than biological / environmental r essur es. A r ecent paper by Cristadoro et al. ( 10 ) showed ha t Chargaf f \u2019s parity rules are not the only symmetry pheomena present in the genetic sequences of Homo sapiens ; nstead, there exists a hierarchy of symmetries at differnt structural scales. These observations are similar across ll nuclear chromosomes of Homo sapiens , thus suggesting hat some mechanisms that shape both the structure and ymmetry work at the same time in the chromosomes, the eading mechanism of which is currently unknown. They urther investigated the evolution of the genome dynamcs, in which they de v eloped a model to mimic the acion of inversion / transpositions of transposable elements n DN A, originall y motiv ated b y Albrecht-Buehler\u2019s simlations ( 20 , 21 ). The results show that the simultaneous ocurrence of symmetry and structure is an emergent proprty of the dynamics of transposable elements in DNA seuences ( 9 ). In particular, they found that symmetry and tructure change differently depending on the time scales, .e., for a large time interval, they were able to reproduce he same structure and symmetry as in extant genome equences.\nAn alternati v e school of thought on the cause of PR-2 as proposed by Zhang et al. ( 22 ). They suggest that the rigin of strand symmetry and oligonucleotide frequency onservation has existed from the very beginning of the enome evolution and thus, compositional features of the enome would be \u201crelics\u201d of the primordial genome as oposed to a feature of e volutionary conv ergence \u2013\u2013 the umrella hypothesis of the previously discussed scientific litrature. Zhang et al. argued that the primordial genome ould be composed of a pproximatel y equal amounts of uniormly distributed forward and their r everse-r epeated seuences, thus resulting in a strand-symmetric genome where requency conservation is a consequence of it, although hey note that the degree of strand symmetry decreases with ncreasing order of oligonucleotides.\nssumption-free approach to look for a link between mutaion rates and PR-2\nf all the prior hypotheses re vie wed abov e, we can see that he NSB approach ( 6 , 14 ) was the one that was proposing strong constraint at the core of the molecular processes hat govern dsDNA composition, thus being as strict as the bservation of the PR-2 compliance in genomes is. Howv er, the approach was dismissed ( 27 , 28 ) due to the expected berrations from NSB ( 29 , 35 ) and / or compositional equiibrium ( 26 ) regionally, in shorter dsDNA spans, and in ome species. In this work, we thus revisit the link between he mutation rate constants and PR-2, but with no initial asumption on the mutation rates and their equalities whatsov er. We numerically calculated the base content coming out f a 4.28 billion years (byr, the estimated age of life on Earth 36 )) dynamics of the unconstrained cross-mutational netor k, where e v ery base mutation is assumed to have an inependent rate constant, i.e. each conversion arrow in Figre 1 B to have an unconstrained k s\u2192 u value, where the subcript denotes the mutation of the base s into u .\nTable 1.

We also simulated systems A) starting from random { A, T , G, C } contents within a range of allowed base content values in eukaryotic and prokary otic organisms f or the first two randomly sampled bases, with the remaining two bases being sampled from 1 \u2212 re mainde r for the four bases to always sum to 1 for a complete genome, and B) starting from initial base content values such that the corresponding C GC and C AT skews are any of the following combinations: (1, 1), (\u20131, 1), (1, \u20131) and (\u20131, \u20131). Howe v er, the subsequent r esults wer e the same as starting from initial base contents at equal proportions of 0.25 each. We ran the simulation four times separately by randomly drawing the mutation rate constants from a uniform distribution. To allow for a broad range for our r andom r ate constants, we took the value of the symmetrycorrected maxim um m uta tion ra te ( k C\u2192 T /k G \u2192 A ) observed in the human genome from ( 24 ), added its standard deviation additionally scaled by multipliers 1, 2, 5 and 10. This resulted in [0, 1.799], [0, 2.490], [0, 4.561] and [0, 8.013] ranges, for all the multipliers respecti v ely. The discussion below operates on the outcomes with the multiplier 1, but we verified that the results did not differ much for the other tried cases. We did this for the following reason: w hile sim ulating the cases and allowing variation in the mutation rate constants, one approach would be to take the human rate constant values and fluctuate around them. Howe v er, as we do not know what kind of fluctuation is relevant in the original life, it is better to simulate cases where we go beyond a certain range, hence scaling the random sampling of the mutation rate constants. In this most general case, all 12 rate constants are unique, and the corresponding system is numerically e volv ed using the following four kinetic equations: dC A dt = k C\u2192 A C C + k T\u2192 A C T + k G \u2192 A C G \u2212 ( k A \u2192 C + k A \u2192 T + k A \u2192 G ) C A dC G dt = k A \u2192 G C A + k C\u2192 G C C + k T\u2192 G C T \u2212 ( k G \u2192 A + k G \u2192 T + k G \u2192 C ) C G dC T dt = k A \u2192 T C A + k G \u2192 T C G + k C\u2192 T C C \u2212 ( k T\u2192 A + k T\u2192 C + k T\u2192 G ) C T dC C dt = k A \u2192 C C A + k T\u2192 C C T + k G \u2192 C C G \u2212 ( k C\u2192 A + k C\u2192 T + k C\u2192 G ) C C (1)\nwhere C s is the content of the base S , and k s\u2192 u is the muta tion ra te constant for the s \u2192 u muta tion. Recording the base contents at the end of the 4.28 byr period, we can see that the final C GC and C AT skews have a wide range of distribution, peaking at 0 (Figure 1 C). That pr efer ence towards 0 is, howe v er, far from the observed PR-2 compliance in actual genomes, where the compliance region is much narrower at around the 0 value for the skews. This is demonstrated in Figure 1 D, where the centre of the plot is zoomed in with the compliance regions highlighted for eukaryotes, prokaryotes and DNA viruses.\nTwo other scenarios were also tried for the simulations, where e v ery independent mutation rate constant is assumed to have (i) a truncated normal distribution centred at their corresponding average values for Homo sapiens , and (ii) symmetry-constr ained r a tes from a trunca ted normal distribution centred at symmetry-averaged rates for Homo sapiens . The values for the mutation rates were taken from ( 24 ) and summarised in Table 1 . For each of the four separate simulations, the standar d de viation values were scaled by m \u2208 { 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 } multiplier values to examine the various spread scenarios around the averages.\nThese results are summarised in Figures S3 and S4. Interestingly, recording the final C GC and C AT skews at the end of the 4.28 byr period for the above two scenarios A) and B), there appears to be an over all, gener al skew observed. To the best of our knowledge, this is most likely an artefact of using a truncated normal distribution, where the sampling has an intrinsic slight positi v e ske wness. As muta tion ra te constants are positi v e r eal numbers and ar e mostly distributed between zero and one, we could not use the normal distribution. Instead, the truncated normal distribution made the most sense for the overall shape of the distribution to resemble the bell-shaped curve with as little skew as close as possible. We, ther efor e, do not belie v e the ske wness observ ed in Figures S3 and S4 is dri v en by a biological phenomenon. We also note tha t, a t 4.28 byr time point, the solutions to the simulation with the symmetry-constr ained r ates B) exhibit a distinct difference in behaviour, as compared to the simulations in A). The simulation B) re v eals pr efer ential islands in C GC v ersus C AT ske w plots (Supplementary Figure S4), and a diagonal spread that is scaled as we increase the standard deviation values for the mutation rate sampling range. Interestingly, the diagonal pattern is found in the actual skew plot for prokaryotic organisms (Figure 1 A).\nD P\nF \u201c t t P C 1 l i v o p t t a u 2 d i i s r o W t w o s f f u s ( t n t t l r t a b t\nL s\nF t u t e r E s u t e 2 t\ni o a m k p t i p w a T m\nt (\ne t a t d\nf t s e f e\nw k T G N\nc\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/51/14/7409/7192623 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\ne novo link between the unconstrained mutation rates and R-2\nor the 25 million in silico generated systems (section Assumption-free approach to look for a link between mua tion ra tes and PR-2\u201d of Results and Discussion), we obained the combinations of rate constants that resulted in R-2 compliant base contents after 4.28 byr. Examining the GC and C AT skews at the end of the simulations (Figure C), we can zoom into the area that is comparable to the seected PR-2 compliance regions, as inferred from the expermental genomes (Figure 1 A) defined in section \u201cThe uniersality of PR-2 in dsDNA genomes of different species\u201d f Results and Discussion. Figure 2 shows the ratios of k s\u2192 u airs that are expected to be equal under the NSB assumpion, but not pre-set as equal in these simulations. We show he distributions of the ratios of k s\u2192 u pairs for all the generted combina tions of ra te constants in Figure 2 A tha t end p with the system complying with PR-2. Those in Figure B show a classical ratio distribution shape heralding the ivision of two uniform distributions (Figure 2 B). Zoomng onto the strict PR-2 compliance region and investigatng the rate constants that resulted in low C GC and C AT kews in our simulations, the above-defined rate constant atios become distributed differently, peaking at the value f 1, though still showing a significant spr ead (Figur e 2 A). e observe the same behaviour with two separate simulaions, where A) the initial { A, T , G, C } contents are sampled ithin a range of allowed base content values in eukarytic and prokaryotic organisms for the first two randomly ampled bases, with the remaining two bases being sampled rom 1 \u2212 re mainde r for the four bases to always sum to 1 or a complete genome, and B) the initial base content vales are sampled such that the corresponding C GC and C AT kews are any of the following combinations: (1, 1), (\u20131, 1), 1, \u20131) and (\u20131, \u20131). Ther efor e, with no constraint on any inerdependence amongst the mutation rates (inter-mutation etwork brought in Figure 1 B), and a wide variety of iniial base compositions tried, we can see that the combinaions of those 12 independent rate constants (Eqs. 1 ) that alow for a PR-2 compliance reflect, at least in part, the NSB ate constant equalities (Eqs. 2 ) within the 4.28 byr evoluion. The combinations still allow a significant variation at round those equalities (Figure 2 A), potentially governed y a higher degree of interdependences in mutation rates hat we investigated in further sections.\nink between the mutation rates and PR-2 under the notrand-bias assumption\nrom section \u201c De novo link between the unconstrained mua tion ra tes and PR-2\u201d of Results and Discussion and Figre 2 A, we inferred that there is a wide range of combinaions in muta tion ra tes tha t can result in genomes tha t exrt Chargaff\u2019s PR-2 as a phenomenon emergent from those ate constants within the timeframe of the age of life on arth. Howe v er, a part of the PR-2 compliant rate contant combinations, springing from our unconstrained simla tions, showed ra te equalities similar to the NSB assumpion. Ther efor e, befor e going on to investigate the more genralised rules that may exist to link mutation rates with PRcompliance, here we first outline the simpler model under he NSB assumption. As discussed in prior literature, equal-\nties of certain mutation rates could be present in DNA wing to its complementary double-stranded nature, if we ssume NSB for muta tion ra tes ( 6 , 14 ). To clarify how the uta tion ra te equalities emerge, consider the example of C\u2192 T = k G \u2192 A (Figure 3 A). Central to the NSB model is a lausible assumption of the strand-invariance of the mutaion rates, i.e. the C \u2192 T mutation happens at the same rate ndependently from whether C is in the template or comlementary strand of the dsDNA. Ther efor e, each strand ill also have the complementary G to A conversions with rate similar to C to T conversion, hence k C\u2192 T = k G \u2192 A . his symmetry in rate constants significantly simplifies the utation network from 12 to 6 independent rate constants:\nk C\u2192 A = k G \u2192 T = i k A \u2192 C = k T \u2192 G = j k C\u2192 G = k G \u2192 C = k k A \u2192 T = k T \u2192 A = l k C\u2192 T = k G \u2192 A = m k A \u2192 G = k T \u2192 C = n\n(2)\nThe reduced number of independent rate constants from he NSB assumption produces a simpler mutation matrix Figure 3 B), and a simpler system of kinetic equations:\ndC A dt\n= iC C + lC T + mC G \u2212 ( j + l + n ) C A dC G dt\n= nC A + kC C + j C T \u2212 ( m + i + k ) C G dC T dt\n= lC A + iC G + mC C \u2212 ( l + n + j ) C T dC C dt = j C A + nC T + kC G \u2212 ( i + m + k ) C C\n(3)\nach describing the evolution of A, G, T and C base conents in fractions. At equilibrium, the system is fully solvble, and the equilibrium base contents are gi v en through he following equations (see Supplementary Note S1 for the erivation):\nC A = C T = ( i + m ) 2 ( i + j + m + n ) C G = C C = ( j + n ) 2 ( i + j + m + n )\n(4)\nThe solutions imply the C A = C T and C G = C C equalities or base composition at equilibrium under NSB for mutaion rates. These solutions also link the mutation rate contants (molecular le v el characteristics of a DNA) with the quilibrium genome composition. We can express that link or the overall G+C content of any genome (under NSB at quilibrium) as follows (Supplementary Note S1):\nn + j i + m = C G + C ( 1 \u2212 C G + C ) (5)\nhere the G+C content is naturally independent from C\u2192 G = k G \u2192 C and k A \u2192 T = k T \u2192 A mutation rate constants. his results in a plot in Figure 3 C, which shows where the +C contents of different genomes should lie under the SB assumption at equilibrium. The NSB assumption can lead to significant simplifiations also when considering oligomers of size > 1 for\nFigure 2.

This r epr esents the most general model, where all the 12 k s\u2192 u rate constants (Figure 1 A) are unique. The system is numerically solved to produce the time evolution of genomic base content within a 4.28 byr period, the current maximum estimate of the age of life on Earth ( 36 ). Plots ( A ) and ( B ) show the distributions of the ratios of k s\u2192 u pairs that are expected to be equal (Eqs. 2 ) according to the no-strand-bias (NSB) assumption, but not pre-set as equal in the simulations. The set of histograms in (A) show such ratios for all the rate combinations in the PR-2 compliance zone peak at the value of 1, showing that the solutions tend to the compliance with the parity rule when the rate constants tend to satisfy the equalities stemming from the NSB assumption, though also showing a substantial variation. The set of histograms in (B) show such ratios for all the ra te combina tions except those in (A), the compliance zone, and have the classical ratio distribution shape, which can be obtained by dividing two uniform distributions.\n,\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/51/14/7409/7192623 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\ncross-mutations. For instance, the dyad case intermutational network can be r epr esented by a tesseract (hypercube), with additional connections within, where each edge r epr esents a mutation in one of the two bases between the dyad of one node to the dyad of another node (Figure 3 C). We can see this in the example of the A pC \u2192 A pT mutation in Figure 3 D. Under the NSB assumption, the system of 16 kinetic equations consisting of 96 independent muta tion ra te constants can be reduced into 48 muta tion ra te constants. The solutions show that this system, independently from the initial rate constant of base composition values, always equilibrates into a set of 10 unique solutions for the base content (Figure 3 F, full derivation in Supplementary Note S2). Those 10 solutions, indeed, reflect PR-2, as follows: [ C Ap A = C TpT ] , [ C ApC = C GpT ] , [ C ApG = C CpT ] , [ C Cp A = C TpG ]\n[ C Gp A = C TpC ] , [ C CpC = C GpG ] , C CpG , C GpC , C ApT , C Tp A (6)\nIn an e v en simpler case, where we assume conte xt independence of the mutation rates, the number of the independent rate constants can further go down into three unique solutions at equilibrium (analytical solutions found in Supplementary Note S2).\n[ C Ap A = C TpT ] = [C ApT ] = [C Tp A ] = ( i + m ) 2\n4 ( i + j + m + n ) 2\n[ C ApC = C GpT ] = [ C ApG = C CpT ] = [ C Cp A = C TpG ] = [ C Gp A = C TpC ] = ( i + m )( j + n )\n4 ( i + j + m + n ) 2\n[ C CpC = C GpG ] = [C CpG ] = [C GpC ] = ( j + n ) 2\n4 ( i + j + m + n ) 2 (7)\nThe above expressions reflect the connection between the genomic dyad content and the underlying individual rate constants. As expected, the three equilibrium solutions from dyad NSB, without context dependence of muta tion ra tes, are the cross multiplica tions of the two unique\nFigure 3.

Thus, by using the princile of ma thema tical induction, there is no clear reason why e cannot extend this model to higher k-mers too.\nhe plausibility of NSB assumption in actual genomes\ns re vie wed abov e, no strand bias (NSB) in the mutation ate constants ( 6 , 14 ) may become in conflict with experiental observations, as any deviation of the mutation rates rom NSB, and / or genomic compositions from PR-2 would uggest that the model is wrong or that the system is out of\nquilibrium. In this section, we show that the NSB model an, overall, be considered a good reductionist assumpion for genomes, and highlight that there are indeed varitions a t a mor e r egional scale and for some of our tested enomes.

This results in a plot with interesting ehaviour shown in Figure 3 C. To investigate how close he present-day genomes lie along this ideal curve, we obained the strand symmetric mutation rate constants from\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/51/14/7409/7192623 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024 17 species across the eukaryotic and prokaryotic kingdoms along with their G+C content and overlaid it with the curve in Figure 4 A ( 25 , 37\u201346 ). On average, the G+C content of the 10 eukaryotes deviates away by a pproximatel y 10% and 18% for the 7 prokaryotes. Interestingly, for all of the 17 species, except for Aotus nancymaae , the observed mutation rate constants suggest that the true G+C content should, in fact, be lower than what we observe in the present day. This may suggest that the genome composition is yet to reach the full equilibrium under NSB. Indeed, as we shall explain in further detail in section \u201cGeneral implications for life: how long does it take to converge to PR-2?\u201d of Results and Discussion, the NSB model suggests that the average time to reach PR-2 compliance occurs within 4.28 byr, the current maximum estimate for the age of life on Earth ( 36 ). Howe v er, using the strand symmetric muta tion ra te constants for 6 of the 10 eukaryotes to numerically calculate the equilibrium base content, we find that Esc heric hia coli , Caenorhabditis elegans , Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens should be closer to or already reaching PR-2 compliance under NSB, while Aotus thaliana and Sacchar om y ces cerevisiae are expected to achie v e equilibrium much later (Supplementary Figure S7). These results broadly match the deviation of the G+C content between the theoretical value at equilibrium and the true value. To investigate the plausibility of NSB assumption further, we employed the Trek methodology ( 24 ), in which we studied the 7-meric context-dependent germline mutation rates for the human genome. We found that the 12 sets of mutation rate constants for each of the plus and minus strands of the dsDNA, still averaged across the whole genomic span for each strand, are, in fact, highly correlated for the human genome (Figure 4 B). This indica tes tha t, while allowing for a regional deviation, NSB holds true for the average mutation rates summarised across the wider length of the human genome. A generalised link between mutation rates and PR-2\nSince the prior considerations and our assumption-free simulation (section \u201cDe novo link between the unconstrained muta tion ra tes and PR-2\u201d of Results and Discussion) show a substantial variation of the mutation rates that can result in PR-2 while not conforming NSB (Figure 2 ), here, we tried to see whether a more generalised model can be found that can predict the PR-2 compliance of a genome, within 4.28 byr of evolution, not necessarily at compositional equilibrium, from mutation rates that are not necessarily NSB compliant. We used a symbolic r egr ession modelling engine, Eureqa (now part of DataRobot), to find interrelations between the constituent 12 mutation rate constants from the sets under the tolerance region of the PR-2 compliance ( 47 , 48 ). Eureqa, de v eloped by Schmidt et al. , determines the functional relationships to best describe the dataset in the simplest form via evolutionary search. The algorithm starts out with a random initial population of some unary (trigonometric, exponential, etc.) and binary (addition, subtraction, etc.) opera tors tha t collecti v ely make up the tree-based graph. Ne xt, e volutionary algorithm mechanisms take place, including mutation and crossover, each with an associated probability, to create offspring. A fitness\nscore is evaluated (mean squared error) on these newly crea ted of fspring. The fittest of fspring will be selected for reproduction, which, in symbolic r egr ession, is ev aluated b y which functional forms describe the data better than others. The least-fit offspring will be replaced by a new population and this process repeats.\nEach muta tion ra te constant was evalua ted as a function of the remaining 11 mutation rate constants in the PR-2 compliance zone, which re v ealed more general mathema tical dependencies tha t ar e mor e r elax ed than the simple equalities of muta tion ra tes under the NSB assumption. Our new set of generalised mutation rate constraints can be described through sets of equations comprised of simple linear combinations of interchangeable mutation rate constants. For each mutation rate constant, Eureqa generated se v eral equa tions, but we selected the ones tha t strike a balance between low error (most accurate) and complexity (measured by the size and ma thema tical complexity of the symbolic expression). At times, the symbolic expressions could reach a high complexity, thus making it difficult to understand the interrelations between the mutation rate constants in a simple manner. We found that a complexity in the range of 7-9 terms provided this simplicity yet maintained its high accuracy. The found 12 simplified constraint equations are as follows:\nk ag = \u22120 . 6 ( kcg \u2212 kgc + kat \u2212 kta + kct \u2212 1 . 3 ktc \u2212 kga \u2212 0 . 6 ) k ga = 0 . 7 ( kcg \u2212 kgc + kat \u2212 kta + kct \u2212 ktc + kag + 0 . 1 ) k tc = 0 . 8 ( 0 . 7 kcg \u2212 kgc + 0 . 8 kat \u2212 kta + kag \u2212 0 . 8 kga + kct + 0 . 4 ) k ct = \u22120 . 8 ( kcg \u2212 kgc + 0 . 8 kat \u2212 kta + kag \u2212 kga + 0 . 1 kca \u2212 ktc \u2212 0 . 3 ) k ac = \u22120 . 8 ( kgc \u2212 kcg + kat \u2212 kta + kgt \u2212 ktg \u2212 kca \u2212 0 . 3 ) k ca = 0 . 8 ( kgc \u2212 kcg + kat \u2212 kta + kgt \u2212 ktg + kac + 0 . 2 ) k gt = \u22120 . 8 ( kgc \u2212 kcg + kat \u2212 kta \u2212 ktg + kac \u2212 kca \u2212 0 . 2 ) k tg = 0 . 8 ( kgc \u2212 kcg + kat \u2212 kta + kgt + kac \u2212 kca + 0 . 1 ) k at = \u22120 . 5 ( \u22122 k ta + k ct \u2212 k tc + k ag \u2212 k ga + k gt \u2212 k tg + k ac \u2212 k ca \u2212 0 . 5 ) k ta = 0 . 5 ( + 2 k at + k ct \u2212 k tc + k ag \u2212 k ga + k gt \u2212 k tg + k ac \u2212 k ca \u2212 0 . 1 ) k gc = \u22120 . 4 ( \u22122 k cg + k tc \u2212 k ct + kga \u2212 k ag + kgt \u2212 k tg + k ac \u2212 k ca \u2212 0 . 06 ) k cg = 0 . 4 ( 2 kgc + ktc \u2212 k ct + kga \u2212 k ag + kgt \u2212 k tg + k ac \u2212 k ca + 0 . 9 ) (8)\nWe can thus state that any mutation rate combination that complies with the above set of equations will lead to a PR-2 compliant genome. To test the performance of the 12 equa tions, we repea ted the simula tion of replica tes following a non-symmetric, uniform distribution (equations in Figure 1 B) by generating 10 million systems and a ppl ying the same PR-2 tolerance values from eukaryotic organisms. Using the test set on the 12 equations, we re v eal that all equations show a strong, positi v e correlation between the true and predicted value (Supplementary Figure S6). This shows that the equations are, on av erage, ab le to capture the majority of the ma thema tical dependencies amongst the mutation rates that result in PR-2 genomes with high accuracy.\nAs initially discussed in section \u201cThe plausibility of NSB assumption in actual genomes\u201d of Results and Discussion, to examine how close the current PR-2 compliant lifeforms are to the fully equilibrated NSB solution (Figure 5 A), we took the mutation rate constants of various species from the eukary otic and prokary otic kingdoms ( 25 , 37\u201346 ) with their\nFigure 4.

We found that the majority of eukaryotic species are loser to the full equilibrium NSB solution, while prokarytic species tend to be further away, despite all species falling ithin the PR-2 tolerance region (Figure 5 B). Therefore, e can outline the presence of genomes that are far from SB / equilibrium but are still PR-2 compliant. If we a ppl y ur set of 12 generalised constraints (Eqs. 8 ), we can verify hat the mutation rates of such genomes are still within the elations to make a PR-2 compliant genome within 4.28 byr. mportantly, we belie v e this demonstration confirms that he dri v ers of PR-2 are still muta tion ra tes, though with contraints more permissi v e and de viant from the pre viously roposed stricter NSB equalities. To convert the mutation requencies into the genomic average muta tion ra te contants in a time domain (Trek-scaling), we used the equation = 2 . 831 f (see Materials and Methods for details on obaining this equation), where f is the mutation frequency for gi v en mutation k s\u2192 u for a gi v en species. The resulting mua tion ra te constants were passed through the generalised quations above (Eqs. 8 ). Here, we demonstrate that the reations are linear and highly correlated (Figure 5 C) for all he 12 constraint equations, more generalised than the simler NSB equalities. To reiterate, Eqs. 8 are obtained from a imulated system with no assumption and prior constraints n the mutation rates in our source simulations, but purely n the PR-2 compliance of the state after 4.28 byr of evolvng. These equations are then applied to PR-2 compliant pecies with known mutation rate constants. Despite some f those species being out of the NSB-dri v en equilibrium, ur r elax ed equations still pr edict their PR-2 compliance. his reinstates the early view that behind PR-2 are the mua tion ra tes, which we no w sho w do not necessarily need to omply with NSB, as soon as they conform to our more genr alised constr aints that seem to be in place for all the tried R-2 compliant species.\nb\nThe generalised equations (Eqs. 8 ) re v ealed abov e for ach of the 12 mutation rate constants were evaluated as function of the remaining 11 rate constants in the PR-2 ompliance zone. Still focusing on the complete spectrum f muta tion ra te constant r epertoir e, we ne xt e xplored a diferent approach. Can we have a machine learning model hat can predict the PR-2 compliance from only the iniial rate constants, without numerically solving the ODE ystem? To this end, we de v eloped a machine learning odel to classify PR-2 compliance as a function of the 12 ndependent, uniform distributed mutation rate constants section \u201cAssumption-free approach to look for a link beween mutation rates and PR-2\u201d of Results and Discussion). he model re v ealed tha t the four muta tion ra te constants A \u2192 T , k T \u2192 A , k G \u2192 C , and k C\u2192 G were the most important or classifying PR-2 compliance (see Supplementary Note 2 for details).\nener al implications f or life: how long does it take to conerge to PR-2?\ne v eloping our simulations to wards tar geting more generlised characteristics of life, here we seek to explore the folowing three questions. (i) W ha t is the average time it takes genome to reach PR-2 compliance? (ii) W ha t is the averge time it takes a genome to reach a compositional equiibrium? (iii) Are there significant differences between the imes of (i) and (ii)? To do this, we analysed the kinetic ystem of equations by starting from random { A, T , G, C } ontents within the range of allowed base content values n eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms for the first two andomly sampled bases, with the remaining two bases beng sampled from 1 \u2212 re mainde r for the four bases to alays sum to 1 for a complete genome, with symmetryonstrained mutation rate constants randomly drawn from normal distribution. Previously, all simulations started ith the initial base content of 25% for each of the four ases, howe v er, in the following work, we remove this re-\nFigure 5. Comparison between species in terms of their closeness to NSB-dri v en equilibrium and closeness to compliance to our generalised equations. ( A ) The base content solutions at equilibrium re v eal the dependencies between the genomic G+C content and the muta tion ra te constants (red line). The strand symmetric mutation rate constants were obtained from 17 species across the eukaryotic and prokaryotic kingdoms ( 25 , 37\u201346 ) and overlaid as a scatterplot with colourings based on their associated eukaryotic (purple) or prokaryotic (dark green) kingdoms. The difference in the G+C content between the true value and the theoretical value along the red curve was calculated for each species, coloured by kingdom, and r epr esented as a bar plot within, sorted in decreasing order: Photorhabdus luminescens A TCC29999, My cobacterium smegmatis, Daphnia pule x, Pristionc hus pacificus, Teredinibacter turnerae, Mus musculus domesticus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Arabidopsis thaliana, Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC948, Rhodosporidium toruloides, Pan troglodytes, Esc heric hia coli, Daphnia magna, Caenorhabditis elegans, Homo sapiens, Drosophila melanogaster, Aotus nancymaae.

Recording the base content C GC vs. C AT skew at the final 4.28 byr time point for all systems and zooming in the C AT skew range of \u00b10.015 and C GC skew range of \u00b10.03, the 2-dimensional kernel density estimate scatterplot in (B) is obtained. The same 17 species from (A) are overlaid and coloured in the same scheme as in (A). The dotted boxes represent the PR2 compliant zones for the eukaryotic (purple) and prokaryotic (dark gr een) kingdoms, wher e each edge of the box r epr esents the total x\u0304 \u00b1 s range for the corresponding axis (see main paper for exact values). ( C ) The strand symmetric mutation rate constants obtained from the 17 species across the two kingdoms, aligned to the Trek-scaling ( 24 ) and substituted the parameters of the 12 sets of mutation rate constant equations. Each plot r epr esents one of the 12 mutation rate constants where each point represents a species, coloured by their corresponding kingdom in the same colouring scheme as in (A) (Supplementary Figure S8 shows all 12 mutation rate constants in each plot, where any gi v en plot is one of 17 species). The Pearson correlation coefficient values are indicated on each graph, where the diagonal dotted line represents perfect correlation with a slope of 1.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/51/14/7409/7192623 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nstriction as we seek to explain the universal nature of PR-2 from a species-invariant perspecti v e. We used the PR-2 tolerance values obtained from the prokaryotic organisms because we learned from the simulation work that the number of systems that fall within the PR-2 compliance zone using the eukaryotic organisms is too small of a fraction from which we could draw any significant conclusions. We can, howe v er, circumv ent this prob lem by using the PR-2 tolerance values from the prokaryotic organisms instead and we also know that these species comply with PR-2.\nPerforming this simulation, we arri v e at an average time to reach PR-2 compliance well within 4.28 byr (Figure 6 ),\nthe current maximum estimate for the age of life on Earth ( 36 ). This happens independently from the initial genome composition and from the randomly selected wide range of muta tion ra tes a t around their human genome values. Interestingly, the system can start to comply with PR-2 e v en befor e r eaching the base content equilibrium. In fact, on average, the PR-2 compliance reaches a pproximatel y one byr before the time to reach compositional equilibration (see Materials and Methods for PR-2 tolerance and genome equilibrium definitions). The average time to reach PR-2 compliance and genome equilibration becomes earlier as we increase the scaling factor. This may be explained in the fol-\nFigure 6. Distribution of time for a genome to reach PR-2 compliance and compositional equilibration. 10 million systems with the simulation model were generated where the initial base content was randomly sampled from the maximum allowed range based on eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms. The strand symmetric mutation rate constants were randomly drawn from a truncated normal distribution. This process was performed four separate times, each with a different multiplier, m , applied to the standar d de viation of the random sampling of the mutation rate constants m { 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 } . The green histograms represent the distribution of time to reach PR-2 compliance and the purple histograms r epr esent the distribution of time to reach genome equilibrium (see Materials and Methods for details). The vertical line intercepts the x-axis at 4.28 billion years, the maximum current estimate of the age of life on Earth ( 36 ).\nl d c n r d i\no t r\nw m T s b M w n e o e a m t b E t t\na r 1 g e o t fi o b s a e\nA\nd D i y p l o c\nD\nT t p i i G l S a h l r\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/51/14/7409/7192623 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 19 January 2024\nowing way: as we increase the scaling factor, we indepenently pick from a wider range of values from which one an r andomly dr aw the mutation r ate constants. As we do ot consider the inter-dependence of the different mutation a te constants, we na turally arri v e a t a situa tion where the ifference between the forward and re v erse rate of reaction s gr eater, ther eby arriving a t an equilibra tion faster. These\nbservations explain the species-invariant and uni v ersal naure of PR-2, as all the genomes have had enough time to each compliance.\nTo compare this emergent behaviour to extant genomes, e obtained the strand-symmetry-accounted normalised utation fractions from work done by Michael Lynch ( 25 ). hese values first need to be converted to muta tion ra te con-\ntants in the time domain (average mutation rate per site per illion years) so we can use it in our simulation model (see aterials and Methods for details). Following conversion,\ne set these mutation rate constants as the mean value in the ormal distribution per species. As done previously, we genrate 10 million systems with the simulation model for each f the six species. Yeast and Arabidopsis thaliana take, on avrage, the longest time to reach equilibration of the genome nd PR-2 compliance. Caenorhabditis elegans , Drosophila elanogaster and Esc heric hia coli take a similar amount of ime to reach equilibration and PR-2 compliance and are all elow the current maximum estimate of the age of life on arth (Supplementary Figure S7). The difference between he time to reach PR-2 compliance and genome equilibraion averages well below two byr.\nOver all, our results demonstr a te tha t by using de novo ssumption-free simulations from kinetic equations and andom human mutation rate constants, we arri v e at a set of 2 equations, which if satisfied by mutation rates of a gi v en enome, would result in a genome compliant with PR-2 v en with strand biases in mutation rates and e v en with outf-compositional-equilibrium state. We show that, indeed, he dsDNA-based genomes, all the ones for which we could nd mutation rate data, conform to these equations. Thus, ur work reinstates the mutation rates as the major dri v ers ehind the emergence of PR-2 compliant genomes demontrating the simple principles behind the complex question, nd can serve as an important basis for future molecular volution studies in genomics.\nbbreviations\nsDNA, double-stranded DNA; ssDNA, single-stranded NA; NSB , no-strand-bias; PR-1, Chargaf f \u2019s first par-\nty rule; PR-2, Chargaff\u2019s second parity rule; myr, million ears; byr, billion y ears; SNP, single nucleotide polymorhism; XGBoost, extreme gradient boosting; ML, machine earning; AUC, the area under the curve; ROC, the recei v er per ating char acteristic; AUROC, the area under the reei v er operating characteristic curve.\nA T A A V AILABILITY\nhe computer code, necessary to process the species across he three kingdoms, perform the simulations, and emloy the machine learning strategy to perform the remainng computations, can be accessed through the followng GitHub repository: https://github.com/SahakyanLab/\nenomicPR2Simulations , and the Genomic PR-2 Simuation w e b application is accessible on https://github.com/ ahakyanLab/GenomicPR2SimsWebApp .
