1. **Investigate the long-term effects of social capital and psychological distress on adherence to the Mediterranean diet.** This could be done through a longitudinal study that follows participants over time to see how their social capital, psychological distress, and dietary habits change. This would help to determine whether the relationships observed in the current study are causal or simply correlational.


2. **Examine the role of other factors that may mediate the relationship between social capital and adherence to the Mediterranean diet.** For example, future research could investigate the role of factors such as physical activity, sleep, and stress. This would help to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the complex relationship between social capital, psychological distress, and dietary behavior.


3. **Explore the effects of social capital and psychological distress on adherence to other healthy behaviors.** For example, future research could investigate the relationship between social capital, psychological distress, and physical activity, smoking, or alcohol consumption. This would help to determine whether the relationships observed in the current study are specific to the Mediterranean diet or whether they generalize to other health behaviors.


4. **Develop and test interventions to improve social capital and reduce psychological distress among young adults.** This could be done through community-based programs, school-based programs, or online interventions. Such interventions could help to promote healthy dietary behaviors among young adults and reduce their risk of chronic diseases.


5. **Investigate the role of social capital and psychological distress in the relationship between the Mediterranean diet and other health outcomes.** For example, future research could investigate the relationship between social capital, psychological distress, and cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or cancer. This would help to determine whether the Mediterranean diet is protective against these diseases through its effects on social capital and psychological distress.
