Introduction Drug-resistant bacterial infections have become a major global public health concern, responsible for a signi cant portion of the total mortality rate globally. The issue of drug resistance has become increasingly prevalent and lead to a signi cant number of fatalities annually. Just in 2019, an estimated 4.95\u00a0million deaths were attributed to drug-resistant infections, with almost 929,000 of those being caused by the six superbugs of ESKAPE: Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp1. The current primary approach to address the challenge of drug-resistant bacterial infections involves modi cations of existing drug structures2, 3. However, the discovery of new antibiotics through this strategy is becoming increasingly di cult. There is a pressing need to explore alternative methods to tackle this problem4.\nAntimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a class of small host defense proteins that have been found to be potential to combat drug-resistant microorganisms5\u20137. But the potential of AMPs as a promising alternative to conventional antibiotics, had several obstacles of cytotoxicity, instability, and high cost, which had impeded their clinical application8\u201310. Several strategies have been developed to overcome these challenges11. For instance, the rational creation of novel AMPs through computational methods for addressing the issue of antibiotic resistance12, and the introduction of non-natural amino acids, such as D-amino acids13, or cyclization, or chemical modi cation to improve peptide stability14, 15,16; Studies showed that the D-isomeric forms of synthetic antimicrobial peptides could improve the stability, especially against enzymatic degradation17\u201319.\nPage 3/25\nIn this study, BamA20, a known bacterial vulnerability4, was used as the target for virtual screening natural amino acids from the Antimicrobial Peptide Database (APD3)21. The peptides were then modi ed through rational design to generate a positively charged helix composed of alternating hydrophobic and basic amino acids, resulting in a non-natural peptide sequence named 11pep. To further enhance the antimicrobial activity of 11pep against drug-resistant bacteria and reduce its resistance, a strategy to replace all the amino acids in 11pep with D-amino acids and reversed the sequence to preserve the alpha helix of the peptides was conducted22. The novel peptide D-11pep was then obtained. In this study, we report the design, synthesis, activity and stability of the BamA targeted antimicrobial peptides and their antimicrobial mechanisms.\n2. Material And Methods\n2.1 Docking-based virtual screening The BamA protein (PDB ID: 7NRE23) was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (https://www.rcsb.org/)24, and a virtual screen was conducted using 385 peptides from bacterial isolates, predicting antimicrobial peptides collected in the APD3 database (https://aps.unmc.edu)21. The active binding sites of the protein are the original ligand-binding sites. During the docking operation, standard precision docking was conducted using SYBYL under default settings. Then, the ne molecular docking of 10 antimicrobial peptides with good docking results using the CDOCKER module of Discover studio (2021). The secondary structures of the intended antimicrobial peptides were predicted using the ESMFold (https://esmatlas.com/)25. 2.2 Molecular dynamics simulation Amber20 was used for molecular dynamics simulations. Peptides were parameterized with the GAFF force eld26, 27, while proteins were parameterized with the AMBER ff19SB force eld28. To produce protein-peptide-membrane complexes, CHARMM-GUI (https://charmm-gui.org/)29 was used to generate phospholipid bilayers. The full cubic water box for each complex was set as the com box by the TIP3P water model {98, 95, 124}. In the AMBER20 package, we simulated the molecular dynamics of 100 ns protein-peptide-membrane complexes utilizing the pmemd.MPI and pmemd.cuda modules and computed their binding free energies by the MM/PBSA program30\u201332. 2.3 Antibacterial activity The strains used in the experiment of Acinetobacter baumannii (ATCC19606), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC27853), Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC700603), Escherichia coli (ATCC25922), Enterobacter cloacae (ATCC13047), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC29213), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC19434), were all standard strains. The drug-resistant strains of Carbapenem-resistant Escherichia coli (CRE), Methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CRPA) and Multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDRAB) used in the experiment were owned by our\nPage 4/25\nlaboratory. 11pep and D-11pep were synthesized from by Sangon Biotech. Imipenem was purchased from Solelybio, and all other chemicals were obtained from Solarbio unless otherwise specially stated.\nThe minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the designed peptides against the tested microbes were detected using standard method according to reference33. The colonies on the plates were rstly diluted with Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB) medium to 106 CFU/mL. Then, every 100 \u00b5L of a bacterial solution containing various concentrations of antimicrobial peptides were put into the 96-well plates, and the absorbance of each well at 600 nm was measured using an enzyme marker after 24 hours of incubation at 37\u00b0C. For the positive control, sterile water was substituted for the medication, and for the negative control, a sterile medium was substituted for the bacterial solution.\nAfter the MIC was determined, the MIC value sample was taken from the well which showed no signs of bacterial growth. This sample was then streaked onto a solid culture medium made of Luria-Bertani broth (LB). The culture was incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C overnight. The lowest concentration that showed the absence of bacterial growth was de ned as the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). 2.4 Time-kill curve Colonies inoculated overnight on LB solid medium were diluted to 108 CFU/mL with saline and subsequently diluted to 105 CFU/mL with LB medium. The bacterial solution was combined with antimicrobial peptides to create a combination concentration of 1/2\u00d7MIC, 1\u00d7MIC, and 2\u00d7MIC, respectively. OD600 was measured every 2 hours for 12 hours. 2.5 Prolonged induction of antimicrobial peptide resistance In order to assess the long-term effects of antimicrobial peptides on CRE, the changes of MIC values over a period of 10 days were evaluated.\nSub-inhibitory concentrations of CRE were rst cultured overnight in MHB, followed by measurement of the MIC of the antimicrobial peptide. The bacteria with the new sub-inhibitory concentration were then cultured overnight in MHB, and the MIC of the antimicrobial peptide was measured again. This process was repeated for 10 consecutive days, with the control of polymyxin B. 2.6 Protease, salt Ion, temperature and pH stability The nal enzyme concentration of trypsin, papain, pepsin, and proteinase K was 1 mg/mL after combining with the different concentration antimicrobial peptide solution, and then the mixture was incubated for one hour in a 37\u00b0C water bath. The MIC of the protease-treated antimicrobial peptides was measured and compared to the untreated control.\nTo further assess the effect of environmental conditions on the antimicrobial activity of the peptides, the MIC was evaluated in the presence of various salt ion solutions (150 mM NaCl, 6 mM NH4Cl, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 4 mM FeCl3, 2.5 mM BaCl2) through a 30-minute incubation at a 37\u00b0C. The\nPage 5/25\nantimicrobial peptides were also treated at various temperatures (0\u00b0C, 37\u00b0C, 100\u00b0C) and pH levels (4, 6, 8, 10) before their MICs were measured. 2.8 Serum stability Different concentrations of FBS (Fetal Bovine Serum) were added to the medium, and the nal concentrations of FBS in the medium-bacterial solution-FBS mixture were 0%, 5%, and 10%, respectively, which were incubated for 30 minutes to determine the MIC. 2.9 Cell viability assay The 104 CFU/mL cell suspension was seeded onto 96-well plates with 100 \u00b5L each well, incubated overnight with various concentrations of antimicrobial peptide solutions, incubated at 5% CO2 for 6 hours, and the cytotoxicity was measured using the MTT kits. 2.10 Hemolytic toxicity assay Sterile sheep blood cell suspensions contained different concentrates of peptides were transferred to 96- well plates. The absorbance at 414 nm was recorded to examine the release of hemoglobin. Positive controls included 10% Triton X-100 and sterile sheep blood cell suspension (ODT), whereas negative controls included PBS and sterile sheep blood cell suspension (ODPBS). The proportion of hemolytic toxicity was estimated using the equation below:\nHemolytic toxicity = 2.11 Cell membrane permeability assay ATCC 19434, CRE, CRPA, and MDRAB were diluted to 107 CFU/mL with a new medium, then treated with an antibiotic peptide of 1\u00d7MIC concentration and incubated at 37\u00b0C. After incubation for 0 h, 0.5 h, 1.5 h, 3 h, 6 h, and 12 h, respectively, the OD260 was determined following the ltration via a 0.22 \u00b5m aqueous membrane. PBS was the negative control, and Triton X-100 was a positive control. 2.12 Bio lm assay The CRE overnight cultures were rstly diluted to 108 CFU/mL with LB. Bacterial solutions containing various concentrations of antimicrobial peptides were added to 96-well plates and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h to immobilize the bacteria on the plates. After staining with crystalline violet stain, the OD450 was determined, and the effect of the antimicrobial peptide on initial bacterial adherence was calculated.\nThe bacterial solution was subsequently diluted to 105 CFU/mL. And the 96-well plate was lled with bacterial solutions containing various doses of antimicrobial peptides and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. The inhibitory effect of antimicrobial peptides on bio lm development was determined by crystalline violet staining.\n(ODtest \u2212 ODP BS) / (ODT \u2212 ODP BS) \u00d7 100%\nPage 6/25\nDiluted bacterial solution (104 CFU/mL) was applied to the 96-well plate, and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h to create a bio lm. After draining the liquid from the 96-well plate, different concentrations of antimicrobial peptide-containing media were added, and the plate was re-incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. The disruptive effect of the antimicrobial peptide on the formed bio lm was studied by crystalline violet staining. 2.13 Scanning electron microscope After overnight incubation, CRE broth was centrifuged at low speed, and then resuspended in PBS. After combining with antimicrobial peptide at a concentration of 2\u00d7MIC, they were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 h on a shaker. After low-speed centrifugation, 5% glutaraldehyde xing was performed for 4 hours, after centrifuging and sequentially the ethanol was added to dehydrate for scanning electron microscopy (JSM-IT700HR, Japan). The bacteria treated with PBS served as a negative control.\n3. Results\n3.1 Virtual screening results based on molecular docking We utilized the original ligand-binding site of the protein as the active binding site, which is the membrane-facing side gate of BamA produced by the \u03b21 and \u03b216 chains via the random coiling of the \u03b216 chain at residue Gly384 (Fig.\u00a01). The results are showed in Table\u00a01.\nTable 1 Molecular docking scores of the screened antimicrobial peptides\nPeptide Score CDOCKER Interaction Energy Sequence\nAP02776 11.74 115.5340 IRWRIRWVRRI\nAP02856 10.03 114.7220 WWWLRRRW\nAP00141 9.78 100.0890 RKWKWEW\nAP02664 9.64 99.2022 KWRRWVRWI\nAP02951 9.60 97.1249 AVWMTRSCVIWKR\nAP03489 9.58 96.8603 EKRWRRLIENYF\nAP02933 9.52 96.8030 TMSLRFWRWKVR\nAP00431 9.43 96.7271 TWLKKRRWKKAKPP\nAP01550 9.39 96.0413 SAVGRHGRRFGLRKHRKH\nAP01301 9.23 96.0282 DEKGPKWKR\n3.2 Rational design of antimicrobial peptides\nPage 7/25\nBased on the amphiphilic nature of antimicrobial peptides and the effect of secondary structure on antimicrobial activity, three antimicrobial peptide fragments (RWV, RRW, RKW) were combined to design a peptide sequence composed of alternating hydrophobic and basic amino acids, following the length criterion of AP02776.\nThe secondary structures were predicted by EMSFold. Subsequently the sequences with \u03b1-helical secondary were continued for ne molecular docking. Detailed information of the peptides was presented in Table\u00a02, among them, 11pep had the highest docking score.\nPrevious studies have suggested that the incorporation of D-amino acids is a promising strategy to enhance both the antimicrobial activity and stability of peptides. In order to preserve the directional orientation of the helix, we created a new peptide, D-11pep, by replacing the 11pep with D-amino acids and reversing its sequence.\nTable 2 The molecular docking scores and sequence of the designed antibacterial peptides\nPeptide CDOCKER Interaction Energy Sequence\n05 116.0800 RKWFRRWKRWV\n03 114.1040 RKWFRRWRRWV\n02 113.2040 RKWLRRWRRWV\n01 108.4460 RKWARRWRRWV\n04 78.8325 RKWFRRWHRWV\n3.3 Interaction of peptides with bacterial lipid membranes in silico The molecular dynamics simulations of the BamA-peptide (11pep and D-11pep)-membrane complexes have been carried out. The results demonstrate that the longitudinal diameter variations of the entire BamA complex treated with 11pep showed a decrease from 29.9\u00c5 to 27.1\u00c5, whereas the variation in the diameter of the complex treated with D-11pep decreased from 28.4\u00c5 to 25.9\u00c5 (Fig.\u00a02).\nFurther analysis reveals that 11pep is capable of forming hydrogen bonds with various residues on the BamA (Fig.\u00a03), including \u03b21 (Gly1, Ser2, Asn4), \u03b29 (Tyr162), \u03b215 (Met354), and \u03b216 (Thr387), as depicted in Fig.\u00a03. D-11pep binds to\u03b21 (Asn4, Phe5, Gly6, blue), \u03b29 (Leu158, Asp159, Arg160, Tyr162, Phe163, green), \u03b215 (Met354, orange), and \u03b216 (Lys385, Thr387, red), indicating that it binds to BamA more tightly than 11pep. These ndings imply that 11pep and D-11pep are capable of polymerizing \u03b21, \u03b29, \u03b215, and \u03b216 chains to ll the BamA cavity. Our molecular dynamics simulations have revealed that the binding mode of the antimicrobial peptides with BamA is highly similar to that of the three main binding\nfragments mentioned above. This observation supports the feasibility of the rational design of antimicrobial peptides through computational methods.\nThe binding free energy of BamA with 11pep and D-11pep were studied by using MM/PBSA. Results showed that the binding free energy of D-11pep was substantially more signi cant than that of 11pep (Table\u00a03), indicating that D-type amino acids may interact with BamA more strongly. The results provide insight into the interactions between BamA and the peptides and provide guidance for further exploration of this study.\nTable 3 Calculated binding free energy of 11pep and D-11pep\nPeptide The binding free energies (kcal/mol) sequence\n11pep -59.4803 RKWFRRWKRWV\nD-11pep -120.9716 vwrkwrrfwkr\n3.4 Antibacterial and bactericidal activity The sequences and molecular weights of the synthesized antimicrobial peptides 11pep and D-11pep are shown in Table\u00a04, all with a purity of over 98%.\nThe minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the antimicrobial peptides against 11 bacterial strains were determined using the microdilution method (Table\u00a05). Our results showed that both 11pep and D11pep exhibit broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, including e cacy against gram-negative bacteria that exhibit resistance to antibiotics.11pep exhibited lower bioactivities against Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC19434), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC27853), and carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CRPA) with MIC values of 8 \u00b5g/mL, 16\u00b5g/mL, and 16\u00b5g/mL, respectively. the MIC of D11pep against Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli (ATCC25922), CRE, and CRPA were 4 \u00b5g/mL, 4 \u00b5g/mL, 8 \u00b5g/mL, and 16 \u00b5g/mL, respectively. Therefore, D-11pep was more effective against drugresistant bacteria than 11pep.\nWe also found that the MBC of the AMPs was nearly twice the MIC, suggesting that a higher concentration of the AMPs was required to achieve bactericidal activity.\nPage 9/25\nN/A: Not applicable. 3.5 Time-kill curve analysis The time-kill curves of 11pep and D-11pep against CRE was evaluated in this study. Results showed that at a concentration of 2\u00d7MIC, both peptides signi cantly reduced the colony counts of CRE by nearly 99.9% (3 log10 of CFU/mL) after 12 hours of incubation, which was markedly lower than that of the control (P < 0.0001). However, the inhibitory effects of 1/2\u00d7MIC of D-11pep against CRE were only signi cant within 2 hours (P < 0.001) compared to the blank control, and this phenomenon disappeared after 2 hours of incubation. Furthermore, the bactericidal ability of 11pep and D-11pep was signi cantly different at different concentrations (P < 0.001) (Figs.\u00a04). Notably, both peptides showed bactericidal ability at a concentration of 2\u00d7MIC, whereas the inhibitory activity at the concentration of 1\u00d7MIC were mainly depended on the drug concentration. These ndings suggest that 11pep and D-11pep are effective in treating CRE infections and could be used as potential therapeutic agents against drug-resistant bacteria.\n3.6 Antimicrobial peptide resistance analysis\nPage 10/25\nCompared to traditional antibiotics, one of the most signi cant advantages of antimicrobial peptides is their reduced sensitivity to drug resistance. As illustrated in Fig.\u00a05, the MIC of D-11pep against CRE remained relatively stable even after 10 days of continuous exposure, whereas the MIC of 11pep increased threefold and the MIC of polymyxin B increased sevenfold. These ndings suggest that D11pep exhibits high e cacy against drug-resistant bacteria, and the replacement of L-amino acids with Damino acids confers an advantage in reducing drug resistance.\n3.7 Protease stability analysis One of the primary obstacles for the in vivo application of peptide medicines is the instability of proteases. To determine the tolerance of 11pep and D-11pep to proteases, their MIC values against CRE were examined after 1 hour of incubation with different concentrations of antimicrobial peptides with trypsin, papain, pepsin, and proteinase K, respectively. As shown in Table\u00a06, D-11pep demonstrated high stability in proteases, with its MIC remaining stable, while 11pep had virtually no antimicrobial activity. These results highlight the susceptibility of 11pep, consisting of L-type natural amino acids, to enzymatic digestion, while D-type amino acids are considerably more resistant to enzymatic degradation. The enhanced protease stability of D-11pep suggests its potential as a promising candidate for in vivo applications as an antimicrobial peptide.\nTable 6 The MIC values of 11pep and D-11pep in the presence of various proteases\nPeptide MIC (\u00b5g/mL) \u00a0\nTrypsin Papain enzyme Stomach protease Proteinase k Control\n11pep \u2265 256 256 \u2265 256 \u2265 256 64\nD-11pep 16 16 32 32 16\n3.8 Salt ion stability analysis The antibacterial activity of 11pep and D-11pep against CRE was tested in various physiological concentrations of salt ion environment to examine the effect of salt ions on the antimicrobial activity of antimicrobial peptides. Results showed that, the MICs of 11pep and D-11pep against CRE were stable in various physiological salts (Table\u00a07).\nPage 11/25\nTable 7 The MIC values of 11pep and D-11pep at different physiological salt ion concentrations.\nPeptide MIC (\u00b5g/mL) \u00a0\nNaCl NH4Cl CaCl2 MgCl2 FeCl3 BaCl2 Control\n11pep 64 64 64 64 64 64 64\nD-11pep 16 16 16 16 16 16 16\n3.9 Temperature and pH stability analysis The results shown in Table 8 indicate that D-11pep did not exhibit improved stability under different temperature and pH conditions compared to 11pep. Speci cally, the MIC values of D-11pep against CRE at 0\u00b0C, 100\u00b0C and under acidic conditions, both achieving a MIC of 2\u00d7MIC. However, in alkaline conditions, D-11pep had a 4 ~ 8 fold increase in MIC, suggesting that pH has a signi cant impact on its antibacterial activity. In contrast, 11pep maintained stability at different temperatures and under acidic conditions, and its MIC reached 2\u00d7MIC under alkaline conditions.\nTable 8 The MIC values of 11pep and D-11pep at different temperature and pH\nPeptide Control Temperature pH\n0\u2103 37\u2103 100\u2103 pH4 pH6 pH8 pH10\n11pep 64 64 64 64 64 64 128 128\nD-11pep 16 32 16 32 32 32 64 128\n3.10 Serum stability analysis The serum stability of a potential drug is a critical factor for evaluating its ability to be a drug. As shown in Table\u00a09, the levels of serum in the medium increased compared to the control (0% FBS), and the antibacterial effectiveness of the antimicrobial peptides against CRE decreased. When the FBS concentration reached 5%, the MIC of 11pep increased by about two-fold, while the MIC of D-11pep did not change even when the FBS level was increased to 10%. These results suggest that D-11pep has better serum stability compared to 11pep, indicating its potential as a drug candidate.\nPage 12/25\nPeptide MIC (\u00b5g/mL)\n0% 5% 10%\n11pep 64 128 128\nD-11pep 16 16 32\n3.11 Cell viability of antimicrobial peptides Cytotoxicity of 11pep and D-11pep on human normal lung epithelial cells (BEAS-2B cells ATCC CRL-9609) were assessed in vitro. Results showed that (Fig.\u00a06), both 11pep and D-11pep did not exhibit signi cant cytotoxicity at the MIC level. The cell viability was signi cantly reduced (P < 0.0001) when the concentration of 11pep and D-11pep was up to 256 \u00b5g/mL, but D-11pep still maintained a cell vitality of more than 60%.\n3.12 Hemolytic toxicity of antimicrobial peptides The hemolytic toxicity of 11pep and D-11pep against sterile sheep blood cells was investigated to evaluate antimicrobial peptides' safety on mammalian cells. Results showed that the straight-chain peptides had lower hemolytic toxicity. As it was shown in Fig.\u00a07, the hemolytic activity of 11pep and D11pep treated sheep erythrocytes was only 18.67% and 20.11%, respectively, even at the maximum concentration (256 \u00b5g/mL).\n3.13 Cell membrane permeability of antimicrobial peptides The ability to permeate cell membranes is a critical factor in the effectiveness of antimicrobial peptides. In this study, the cell membrane permeability of 11pep, D-11pep, and the positive control imipenem (IPM) were evaluated in four bacterial strains, including CRE, MDRAB, CRPA, and Enterococcus faecalis, at a concentration of 1\u00d7MIC. The results demonstrated that after 12 hours of treatment, all three agents caused signi cant changes in cell membrane permeability in the tested bacteria (P < 0.0001). Among the tested peptides, 11pep achieved a maximum cell membrane permeability of 52.65%, 56.15%, 59.91%, and 64.01% against the four strains, while D-11pep achieved substantially higher values of 86.87%, 74.05%, 87.28%, and 85.51%, respectively. Notably, D-11pep showed signi cantly different results compared to IPM (P < 0.0001), suggesting that D-11pep may act by disrupting the permeability of the cell membrane.\n3.14 Bio lm analysis This study aimed to investigate the effects of antimicrobial peptides on CRE bacterial bio lms, speci cally in terms of their ability to suppress bacterial adhesion, inhibit bio lm development, and\nPage 13/25\ndisrupt established bio lms. Results from Fig.\u00a09 (A) demonstrated that all three peptides, 11pep, D-11pep, and IPM, were able to inhibit initial bacterial adherence. At a concentration of 1\u00d7MIC, D-11pep was signi cantly more effective than both IPM and 11pep, reducing the adhesion rate to 58.79%. At higher concentrations (2\u00d7MIC, 4\u00d7MIC, and 8\u00d7MIC), D-11pep was also signi cantly more effective than IPM, while 11pep had no signi cant difference. These results suggest that D-11pep can effectively inhibit the initial attachment of CRE bacterial bio lm at a concentration of 1\u00d7MIC.\nThe results from Fig.\u00a09 (B) indicated that both 11pep and D-11pep were signi cantly more effective than IPM at concentrations as low as 1\u00d7MIC and 2\u00d7MIC in terms of inhibiting bio lm formation. All three peptides signi cantly suppressed bio lm formation compared to the control, with higher concentrations resulting in greater suppression. In Fig.\u00a09 (C), both 11pep and D-11pep caused signi cant disruption of established bio lms at 2\u00d7MIC and 4\u00d7MIC concentrations when compared to IPM. The disruptive effects of all three peptides were proportional to their concentrations on the bio lm, with D-11pep showing the greatest effect at lower concentrations (1\u00d7MIC and 2\u00d7MIC).\nOverall, the results suggest that D-11pep has the greatest in uence on all three bio lm characteristics and performs best at lower doses. The differences in bio lm inhibition and disruption between 11pep and D11pep were substantial at lower concentrations but decreased as concentrations increased. These ndings highlight the potential of antimicrobial peptides.\n3.15 Observation of the effects of antimicrobial peptides on membranes using Scanning Electron Microscopy SEM was used to evaluate the antibacterial mechanisms of 11pep and D-11pep on CRE after a 2-hour treatment. Results showed that the peptides could damage the surface of CRE (Fig.\u00a010). Compared to PBS, CRE surfaces treated with 11pep and D-11pep exhibited considerable wrinkling, damage, and rupture. Treatment with 11pep caused obvious crumpling of the CRE cell surface, while treatment with D11pep resulted in cell rupture and the discharge of cell contents. These ndings indicate that both 11pep and D-11pep have an antibacterial mechanism of breaking the cell membrane, and D-11pep being more potent than 11pep.\n4. Discussion And Conclusions Antimicrobial resistance is a complex and multifaceted issue that has emerged as a leading cause of death worldwide1. To combat this problem, novel antimicrobial agents are urgent needed to be developed 2, 34, 35. Rational design could create diverse peptide sequences and structures to enrich the precursor chemical library of antimicrobial drugs. Moreover, computer software could assist in targeted design, reducing redundancy and improving the overall e ciency of the process.\nBamA, a fundamental core component of the outer membrane protein (OMP) family36, plays a critical role in mediating the insertion of OMPs into the outer membrane37, which was considered to be the Achilles'\nPage 14/25\nheel of bacteria, and thought to be a potent target for antimicrobial agents. Compounds targeted to BamA are considered to be good antibacterial activity, such as Darobactin38, which showed excellent antimicrobial activity by closing the BamA lateral gate23. In this study two novel antibiotic peptides of 11pep and D-11pep, which were polymerized the \u03b21, \u03b29, \u03b215, and \u03b216 chains of BamA, were designed and synthesized. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the antibiotic peptides could bypassed the problem of resistance caused by BamA mutations through occupying the cavity and lateral gate regions of BamA.\nIn order to overcome the drawbacks of toxicity, instability, and high cost of antimicrobial peptides39. The strategies of reversing the sequence of the original antimicrobial peptide and incorporating D-amino acids, were conducted in this study. This not only could reserve the alpha-helix structure of the antimicrobial peptide, which is critical for its activity, but also could provide increased stability by generating peptide bonds that are resistant to enzymatic degradation40, and improving the half-life of antimicrobial peptides in vivo.\nAntibacterial activities result showed that both 11pep and D-11pep designed and synthesized by the above-mentioned strategies, had broad-spectrum antibacterial effects, while D-11pep had an 8-fold reduction in MIC comparing to that of 11pep, and were more effective than 11pep against drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (CRE and CRPA). This simple and cost-effective strategy has shown promising results, as D-11pep demonstrated a greater increase to 11pep in antibacterial activity19, 41.\nThe antibacterial mechanism of 11pep and D-11pep were also tested in this study. Results of SEM showed that both the peptides could damage the surface of CRE, and D-11pep could eliminated 69.31% of bacterial bio lm at 1\u00d7MIC concentration, once again consisted with the result of molecular dynamics simulations.\nStability tests of antimicrobial peptides revealed that, in comparison to 11pep, D-11pep exhibited greater stability, except for changes in temperature and pH, and was found to be less toxic.\nIn conclusion, the designed BamA targeted antimicrobial peptides have good antibacterial activities, and the replacement of natural amino acids with D-amino acids could enhance the antibacterial e cacy, stability, and toxicity of linear peptides, while decreasing their resistance. This study gives fresh insights into the rational design of novel BamA targeted antimicrobial peptides against drug-resistant bacteria via computational techniques and the D-amino acids replacement on antimicrobial peptides.\nAbbreviations CRE: Carbapenem-resistant Escherichia coli; MRSA: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus; CRPA: Carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa; MDRAB: Multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii; AMPs: Antimicrobial peptides; MIC: Minimum Inhibitory Concentration; MHB: Mueller-Hinton Broth; LB:\nPage 15/25\nLuria-Bertani broth; MBC: Minimum Bactericidal Concentration; SEM: Scanning Electron Microscopy; FBS: Fetal Bovine Serum.\nDeclarations Declaration of Competing Interest\nThe authors declare no competing nancial interest.\nAuthor's contribution\nYuanqiang Wang and Li Yang collaborated on the conception and design of the study, with Li Yang conducting the experiments, analyzing the data, and writing the manuscript.
