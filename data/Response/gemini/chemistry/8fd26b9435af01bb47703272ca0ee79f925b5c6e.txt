1. **Investigate the impact of various divalent cations on the kinetics of myosin and troponin in real-world conditions.** This could involve studying the effects of these cations on muscle contraction and relaxation in both healthy and diseased states.


2. **Examine the potential role of EF-hand proteins and the myosin ATP-binding pocket as molecular targets for toxic cations.** This could involve investigating the binding affinities of various cations to these proteins and determining how these interactions affect their function.


3. **Explore the possibility of using divalent cations as therapeutic agents for cardiovascular diseases.** This could involve investigating the potential of these cations to modulate the activity of EF-hand proteins and the myosin ATP-binding pocket in order to improve cardiac function.


4. **Investigate the potential role of divalent cations in the development of cardiovascular diseases.** This could involve studying the accumulation of these cations in the myocardium and examining their potential role in the pathogenesis of conditions such as heart failure and arrhythmias.


5. **Develop new methods for detecting and quantifying divalent cations in the myocardium.** This could involve developing new imaging techniques or biosensors that can specifically detect and measure the levels of these cations in cardiac tissue.
