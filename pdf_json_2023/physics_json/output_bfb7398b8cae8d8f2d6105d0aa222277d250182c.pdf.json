    "abstractText": "Both sulfonyl and phosphorothioate are important privileged structural motifs which are widely presented in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Herein, we describe an efficient approach to synthesizing sulfonyl-containing phosphorothioates by merging photoredox and copper catalysis at room temperature. This protocol is compatible with a wide range of substrates and can be applied to the late-stage modification of complex molecules. Control experiments are conducted to demonstrate the generation of the sulfonyl radical in the transformation.",

            "text": "In recent years, phosphorothioates have received continued attention owing to their remarkable biological activities and broad applications in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries [1\u20134]. These compounds not only can be used as potential therapeutic molecules, anticancer agents, antivirals and pesticides but also serve as valuable building blocks in organic synthesis [5\u20139]. In this context, numerous methodologies have been reported for their synthesis [10]. On the other hand, as a prominent class of organosulfur compounds, sulfones play a pivotal role in various drugs, pesticides and natural products [11\u201317]. To date, methods for the construction of sulfonyl compounds from sulfonyl chlorides, sodium sulfinates or sulfur dioxide surrogates have attracted considerable attention, and significant progress has been made in this area [18\u201324]. However, despite these achievements, the preparation of sulfonyl-containing phosphorothioates has been rarely explored. In the last few decades, the direct vicinal difunctionalization of alkenes has emerged as a powerful strategy to access complex molecules, which could introduce two functional groups into the double bond simultaneously [25\u201332]. Accordingly, substantial efforts have been devoted to the construction of sulfonyl-containing compounds via the difunctionalization of alkenes, such as hydrosulfonation, oxysulfonation, aminosulfonylation and selenosulfonation [33\u201335]. However, only limited examples have been developed for the thiosulfonylation of alkenes involving the simultaneous installation of two C\u2013S bonds (Scheme 1a). For example, Xu et al. reported a thiosulfonylation reaction of alkenes in the presence of a dual gold/photoredox catalysis system [36,37]. Lian and co-workers established a thiocyanatosulfonation of \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated amides/esters using TMSNCS, aryldiazonium tetrafluoroborates and sulfur dioxide to access \u03b2-thiocyanated sulfone compounds [38]. Our group also disclosed an intramolecular thiosulfonylation of alkenes\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7869. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28237869 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7869 2 of 9\nto deliver sulfonated [3,1]-benzothiazepines under metal-free conditions [39]. Given the importance of phosphorothioates and sulfones in organic and medicinal chemistry, we hypothesized that the introduction of these two functional groups into alkenes using the vicinal difunctionalization strategy would contribute to synthetic community and drug discovery. Herein, we describe a mild and efficient method to synthesize sulfonylcontaining phosphorothioates via the thiosulfonylation of alkenes using sulfonyl chlorides and phosphorothioic acids (Scheme 1b). In the presence of photoredox and copper catalysis, this practical reaction features a broad substrate scope and can be readily applied to the late-stage functionalization of bioactive molecules.\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 9\nunsaturated amides/esters using TMSNCS, aryldiazonium tetrafluoroborates and sulfur dioxide to access \u03b2-thiocyanated sulfone compounds [38].

Then, we explored the substrate scope of commercially availabl aromatic and aliphatic sulfonyl chlorides. As expecte , vari us sulfonyl chlorides with substituents on the aromatic ring underwent the reaction efficie tly, giving the corresponding sulfonyl-containing phosphorothioates 5a\u20135h with moderate to good yields. Remarkably, the aliphatic sulfonyl chlorides were also suitable substrates to deliver the desired products 5i\u20135m in reasonable yields. In addition, the scope of other alkoxy- or aryloxy-substituted phosphorothioic acids was evaluated and it was found that O,O-dimethoxy, diisopropoxy and diphenoxy phosphorothioic acid reacted well to afford products 5n\u20135p in 57\u201397% yields. Furthermore, the robustness of this three-component protocol was evaluated via the late-stage functionalization of bioactive molecules. As shown in Scheme 2, the alkenes derived from indomethacin, estrone, ciprofibrate and febuxostat were found to be compatible under the standard conditions to deliver the desired products 6a\u20136d in 55\u201394% yields. To illustrate the mechanism for this visible-light-mediated reaction, some additional control experiments were performed (Scheme 3). First, when three equivalents of radical scavenger (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl (TEMPO) were added to the model reaction under the standard conditions, the formation of product 4a was completely suppressed, suggesting that a free radical pathway might be involved in this reaction. Equally, a radical clock experiment was performed using vinyl cyclopropane 7, and the ring-opening product 8 was obtained with a 24% yield.

Flash column chromatography was performed using silica gel (60 \u00c5 pore size, 32\u201363 \u00b5m, standard-grade). Analytical thin-layer chromatography was performed using glass plates pre-coated with 0.25 mm 230\u2013400 mesh silica gel impregnated with a fluorescent indicator (254 nm). Thin-layer chromatography plates were visualized using exposure to ultraviolet light. The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded in parts per million from internal tetramethylsilane on the \u03b4 scale. The 1H, 13C and 19F NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 using a Bruker DRX 400 spectrometer (Bruker, Fallanden, Switzerland) operating at 400 MHz, 100 MHz and 376 MHz, respectively. All chemical shift values are quoted in ppm and coupling constants quoted in Hz. High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) spectra were obtained using a micrOTOF II instrument."

            "text": "In conclusion, we have developed a visible-light-mediated three-component reaction of alkenes, sulfonyl chlorides and phosphorothioates under blue LED irradiation at room temperature. This efficient protocol shows a broad substrate scope, high functional group tolerance and excellent chemoselectivity. Under the mild reaction conditions, a variety of sulfonyl-containing phosphorothioates were obtained with moderate to good yields. Moreover, the gram-scale synthetic capability and late-stage functionalization of the bioactive molecules demonstrated the applicability of this methodology.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28237869/s1, including the characterization data and 1H, 13C and 19F NMR spectra of products 4, 5, 6.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, J.W., G.L. and F.-S.H.; methodology, X.W.; software, F.-S.H.; validation, M.C. and S.Z.; formal analysis, F.-S.H.; investigation, X.W., M.C. and S.Z.; resources, J.W. and F.-S.H.; data curation, X.W. and F.-S.H.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, F.-S.H.; writing\u2014 review and editing, J.W., G.L. and F.-S.H.; visualization, X.W. and M.C.; supervision, J.W., G.L. and F.-S.H.; project administration, X.W., M.C. and S.Z.; funding acquisition, J.W. and F.-S.H.
