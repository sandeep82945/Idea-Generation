 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate binding of toxic divalent cations like Pb2+, Cd2+, and Hg2+ to cardiac troponin C and myosin regulatory light chains. The paper suggests these could be targets for toxic metals but more research is needed.

2. Examine how amino acid substitutions or post-translational modifications of EF-hand proteins like troponin C alter their affinity for different divalent cations. This could help explain mechanisms of cation toxicity. 

3. Study effects of physiologically relevant divalent cations at high concentrations on myosin ATPase kinetics and actomyosin interactions. This could give insight into muscle dysfunction in cation imbalances.

4. Compare binding and effects of divalent cations on different myosin isoforms. The paper notes isoforms may respond differently.

5. Research transport mechanisms and accumulation of less studied divalent cations in cardiomyocytes, like Ni2+, Co2+, to better understand their potential toxicity.
