 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming the given paper:

1. Develop more advanced and robust localization and mapping algorithms for autonomous vehicles to handle complex environments. The paper mentions challenges with localization and path planning causing issues. More research on SLAM, sensor fusion, etc. could improve this.

2. Explore reinforcement learning and adaptive control techniques for autonomous vehicle path tracking and control. The paper uses a model-based approach, but data-driven methods may be more flexible. 

3. Investigate how to make the fault detection system more explainable using methods like SHAP values. This could help debug issues faster.

4. Test the fault detection system on a wider variety of road conditions and traffic scenarios. The paper only evaluates on a motorway dataset. Testing on city roads would be important.

5. Look at integrating the fault detection system with vehicle health monitoring and anomaly detection systems. This could provide earlier warning of potential faults before they occur.
