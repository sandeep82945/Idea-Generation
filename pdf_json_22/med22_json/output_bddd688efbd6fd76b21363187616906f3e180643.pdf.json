    "abstractText": "Background: New vaccines that are initially approved in clinical trials are not completely free of risks. Systematic vaccine safety surveillance is required for ensuring safety of vaccines. This study aimed to provide a protocol for safety monitoring of COVID\u201019 vaccines, including Sputnik V, Sinopharm (BBIBP\u2010CorV), COVIran Barekat, and AZD1222. Methods: This is a prospective cohort study in accordance with a template provided by the World Health Organiza\u2010 tion. The target population includes citizens of seven cities in Iran who have received one of the available COVID\u201019 vaccines according to the national instruction on vaccination. The participants are followed for three months after they receive the second dose of the vaccine. For each type of vaccine, 30,000 people will be enrolled in the study of whom the first 1,000 participants are in the reactogenicity subgroup. The reactogenicity outcomes will be followed seven days after vaccination. Any hospitalization, COVID\u201019 disease, or other minor outcomes will be investigated in weekly follow\u2010ups. The data are gathered through self\u2010reporting of participants in a mobile application or phone calls to them. The study outcomes may be investigated for the third and fourth doses of vaccines. Other long\u2010term outcomes may also be investigated after the expansion of the follow\u2010up period. We have planned to complete data collection for the current objectives by the end 2022. Discussion: The results of this study will be published in different articles. A live dashboard is also available for man\u2010 agers and policymakers. All data will be available on reasonable requests from the corresponding author.The use of the good and comprehensive guidelines provided by WHO, along with the accurate implementation of the protocol and continuous monitoring of the staff performance are the main strengths of this study which may be very useful for policymaking about COVID\u201019 vaccination.",

With the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring COVID-19 disease as an epidemic on March 11, 2020, joint international efforts to develop a vaccine were intensified [4]. The vaccines, as one of the best interventions developed to control the COVID-19 pandemic, have saved countless lives [5]. However, evaluation of the performance of COVID-19 vaccines in the real world has always been necessary to understand the risks and benefits of vaccination programs, especially regarding the acceptance of the vaccines by the general public, as well as health care providers [6, 7]. Under such circumstances, local health-oriented researches increased with calls from policymakers, officials, and health executives [8]. Numerous studies have examined the efficacy and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines, as well as their short- and long-term side effects [5, 9\u201311].\nTo estimate the adverse events due to the vaccines, the WHO recommended designing and implementing prospective cohort studies. Such studies can follow up vaccinated individuals regularly and record the adverse events. Publishing study protocols, as well as informing the scientific community of the studies that have been done or are being done, helps to prevent duplication and results in better coordination of research efforts. On the other hand, making study protocols available to the public has the benefit of disseminating the most modern ideas with regard to study design and data analysis [12]. This study introduces the protocol of a national cohort study in Iran to monitor adverse events and also to detect safety signals after COVID-19 vaccination."

The seven study sites were selected based on the availability of tertiary hospitals with the capacity to diagnose the AESIs, the commitment of local authorities, and the availability of eligible co-investigators around the country. Based on the vaccination program in Iran, at the beginning of the study, mainly health care workers, people over 50\u00a0 years old, and those with underlying diseases were recruited. With the expansion of the vaccination program, all people over the age of five could participate in the study. Participation in this study is completely voluntary, and the recruitment is done after obtaining written informed consent from the participants. Samples of 1000 people for estimation of the incidence of local and systemic reactions and 30,000 people for other outcomes are planned\nto participate in each vaccine. In other words, for each vaccine, 30,000 people will be enrolled in the study, of whom the first 1,000 ones are in the reactogenicity subgroup. The Sinopharm vaccine has two subgroups of 30,000 people, one for the ones over 18 and the other for those under 18\u00a0years old. The sample size was calculated according to the guideline of the WHO to detect adverse events that occur in more than one case per 10,000 vaccinated individuals [13]."

The participants are also asked about systemic signs, including fever, nausea, chills, headache, joint pain, myalgia, malaise, and fatigue from three days before vaccination [13]. The first 1000 people for each vaccine (reactogenicity subgroup) will be under active surveillance on a daily basis for seven days after the vaccination for both the first and second doses. In the case of any local adverse effects (including pain, induration, swelling, warmness, redness, bruise, and itching at the injection site) or systemic adverse effects described above, the required data are recorded into the software. The severity of each reactogenicity adverse effect is also assessed by asking questions about the extent to which that adverse effect interferes (does not interfere, somewhat interferes, and considerably interferes) with the individuals\u2019 daily activities (Table\u00a01).\nTo gather the above data, a web application has been designed for participants to record their own reports. This application is installed on their mobile phones on the day of vaccination, and people are asked to record possible reactions for seven days after each injection of the vaccine. If the self-report is not done through the mobile application by 16:00, they are contacted by phone up to twice on the same day. If no response is recorded from the participants and their next of kin by 23:59, the follow-up of that day is recorded as loss to follow up for that day.\nThe trained officers (interviewers or data collectors) contact the participants on a weekly basis for three months (13\u00a0 weeks) for single-dose vaccines and four months (17\u00a0 weeks) for COVIran Barekat, Sinopharm (BBIBP-CorV), and Sputnik V. For the AZD1222 vaccine, the follow-up period is 25\u00a0weeks due to the longer interval between the two doses of the vaccine. In this study, any overnight hospitalization or reported death is recorded as a Serious Adverse Event (SAE). In addition to the active surveillance described above, weekly reports are also prepared through self-reporting of participants using the mobile application.\nAfter sending the data by the participants using the mobile application, the information is read instantly in the registration system and used in the live management dashboard. If a participant records an important event,\nthe trained officers are notified immediately and contact the person, and further follow-up is done actively."
