    "abstractText": "Donor-acceptor (D-A) type conjugated polymers are of high interest in the field of electrochromism. In this study, three novel conjugated copolymers (PBPE\u20131, PBPE-2 and PBPE-3) based on quinoxalino[2\u2032,3\u2032:9,10]phenanthro[4,5-abc]phenazine (A) as the acceptor unit and 4,8-bis((2octyldodecyl)oxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b\u2032]dithiophene (D1) and 3,3-didecyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-thieno[3,4b][1,4]dioxepine (ProDOT-decyl2, D2) as the donor units with different donor-to-acceptor ratios were successfully synthesized through Stille coupling polymerization. The polymers were then characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV), fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectoscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), spectroelectrochemistry, thermogravimetry (TG), electrochromic switching and colorimetry. Optical band gap values were calculated as 1.99 eV, 2.02 eV and 2.03 eV, respectively. The three copolymers have good solubility, distinct redox peaks, wide absorption spectra, good thermal stabilities, bright color changes and significant electrochromic switching properties. Compared to the other two copolymers, the PBPE-3 film exhibited high coloration efficiency values of 513 cm2\u00b7C\u22121 at 504 nm and 475 cm2\u00b7C\u22121 at 1500 nm. The films have the advantage of exhibiting cathodic and anodic coloration.",

            "text": "In the past few decades, the field of conductive conjugated polymers has made great breakthroughs, and many organic optoelectronic materials [1\u20133] with excellent properties have been developed. Conductive polymers have been widely used in military camouflage, organic light-emitting diodes (OLED) [4\u20136], energy-saving materials, optical displays, organic thin-film transistors (OTFT) [7,8] and other fields [9] because of their excellent optoelectronic properties. Only donor-type polymers have shown potential in completing the RGB color spectrum [10\u201314]. Furthermore, the donor-acceptor (D-A) type of electrochromic (EC) material conjugated polymers [15\u201319] has the advantages of high environmental stability, rich color change, easy film formation, band gap adjustment, high coloring efficiency and contrast. The optical and electrochemical properties of the D-A type conjugated conductive polymer can be effectively adjusted by molecular structure design and modification [20,21]. Adjusting the band gap can effectively control the optical and electrochemical properties of the electrochromic polymer. Reynolds\u2019 research group has done a lot of research by controlling the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) and LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) energy levels of the polymers to adjust the optical band gap [10\u201312]. In particular, the\nPolymers 2023, 15, 940. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym15040940 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2023, 15, 940 2 of 14\nsynthesis of low-band-gap polymers has been favored by researchers due to their low driving voltage, good p-type doping and n-type doping characteristics [22] and rich color rendering. Therefore, a large number of technical reports has been published on the design, synthesis and characterization of low-band-gap conjugated polymers [23\u201328]. The D-A type polymer containing an electron donor and an electron-accepting unit has a strong carrier-transporting ability, which is the most effective method to synthesize low-band-gap polymer materials. Therefore, the incorporation of alternating strong electron donor and electron acceptor units into a polymer is a common method for constructing low-band-gap system polymers because the donor-acceptor construction has higher HOMO and lower LUMO energy levels, which can effectively reduce the band gap for electron transition. In this study, an indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass was used as an electrode to cover the electrochromic polymer film to promote ion migration [29]. We used benzodithiophene derivatives (BDT, D1) and ProDOT-decyl2 (D2) as the donor units. The D1 unit has a large planar conjugate structure, forming \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking, which may result in high hole mobility and charge carrier transport rate [30\u201332]. At present, conjugated polymers based on benzodithiophene are mainly used in the construction of organic photovoltaic (OPV) [33,34], and there are relatively few reports on electrochromic properties [35]. In order to improve the solubility of polymer and achieve large-scale production and application of electrochromic materials, it is a useful and common method to incorporate long alkyl or alkoxy side chains into the backbone of the polymer molecular framework structure. In addition, Hou et al. found that the energy level and band gap of a polymer can be effectively adjusted by copolymerizing a benzodithiophene analog with different electron-rich or electron-deficient aromatic groups [30]. ProDOT exhibits excellent performance [36,37], with a high HOMO energy level and coloring efficiency, and the introduction of an alkyl side chain on the central carbon atom of the propylene bridge can also greatly increase the solubility of the copolymers. The optical and electrochemical properties of conjugated polymers are changed by the combination of electronic and spatial effects. Aromatic heterocyclic compounds containing C=N groups are often used as acceptors to construct polymers due to their electron-withdrawing ability and \u03c0-conjugated features. Structural modification of a traditional electron acceptor by hetero atom substitution or heterocyclic ringing can cause a change in energy band gap (Eg), thereby adjusting the photoelectric properties of the conjugated polymers. In this paper, a novel compound, quinoxalino[2\u2032,3\u2019:9,10]phenanthro[4,5-abc]phenazine was used as the acceptor unit, which has a large planar structure and more active sites where the chemistry occurs, inducing hypercrossed polymers [38]. The acceptor unit can enhance the degree of conjugated electron delocalization and facilitates the absorption of photons. On the foundation of above results, we used benzodithiophene derivatives (D1) and ProDOT-decyl2 (D2) as the donor units and a functionalized electron-deficient pragmatic molecule (A) as the acceptor unit. By changing the feed ratio of three monomers, three polymers were synthesized by Stille coupling reaction and named PBPE-1, PBPE-2 and PBPE-3, respectively. The structure, as well as electrochemical, kinetic, spectroelectrochemical and thermal stability, of the corresponding polymers, was researched in detail, as presented in the following sections."

All three polymers showed definite optical contrast, cycling stability, fast response time and high thermodynamic stability. Consequently, our results indicate that cross-linked D-A type and soluble conjugated polymers can be prepared by adopting a multi-functionalized unit (four) with a bisquinoxaline structure as the acceptor unit and alkylated BDT and ProDOT unit as the donor units. The photoelectric properties of the resultant polymers, including the light absorption range and electrochromic kinetic properties, can be modulated by changing the feed ratios of the donor units to the acceptor unit in a synthetic procedure. More efforts should be devoted to the development of this type of polymer due to their expectant properties, especially in the electrochromic field.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/polym15040940/s1, Figure S1: synthesis route of the donor 2; Figure S2: 1H NMR (a) and 13C NMR (b) spectra of 3,3-didecyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-thieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxepine, \u2018x\u2019 represents the CDCl3 solvent peak and \u2018y\u2019 represents the water peak; Figure S3: 1H NMR (a) and 13C NMR (b) spectra of 6,8-dibromo-3,3-didecyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-thieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxepine, \u2018x\u2019 represents the CDCl3 solvent peak and \u2018y\u2019 represents the water peak; Figure S4: 1H NMR spectra of PTPE-1(a), PTPE-2(b), PTPE-3(c); Figure S5: XPS spectra of polymer PBPE-2: (a) C1s, (b) N1s, (c) O1s and (d) S2p; Figure S6: XPS spectra of polymer PBPE-3: (a) C1s, (b) N1s, (c) O1s and (d) S2p; Figure S7: Electrochromic switching of PBPE-2 at 508 nm and 1500 nm with intervals of 10 s, 4 s, 2 s and 1 s; Figure S8: Electrochromic switching of PBPE-3 at 504 nm and 1500 nm with intervals of 10 s, 4 s, 2 s and 1 s; Figure S9: (a) Lightness (L*) and (b) colorimetry values (a* b*) for the PBPE-2 films in three different optical densities as a function of applied potential; Figure S10: (a) Lightness (L*) and (b) colorimetry values (a* b*) for the PBPE-3 films in three different optical densities as a function of applied potential.\nPolymers 2023, 15, 940 13 of 14\nAuthor Contributions: Writing-original draft preparation, Z.X.; Software, B.W.; Formal Analysis, L.K.
