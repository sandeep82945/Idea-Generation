    "abstractText": "We study the localization and topological transitions of the generalized non-Hermitian SSH models, where the non-Hermiticities are introduced by the complex quasiperiodic hopping and the nonreciprocal hopping. We elucidate the universality of the models and how many models can be mapped to them. Under the open boundary condition, two delocalization transitions are found due to the competition between the Anderson localization and the boundary localization from the nontrivial edge states and the non-Hermitian skin effect. Under the periodic boundary condition, only one delocalization transition is found due to the disappearance of the non-Hermitian skin effect. The winding numbers of energy and the Lyapunov exponents in analytical form are obtained to exactly characterize the two deloaclizateon transitions. It finds that the delocalization transitions don\u2019t accompany the topological transition. Furthermore, the large on-site non-Hermiticity and the large nonreciprocal hopping are all detrimental to the topological transitions. However, the large nonreciprocal hopping enhances the Anderson localizations. The above analyses are verified by calculating the energy gap and the inverse of the participation ratio numerically.",

Sun1, 1 and C. S. Liu1, 1, \u2217\n1Hebei Key Laboratory of Microstructural Material Physics,\nSchool of Science, Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, 066004, China.\n(Dated: March 23, 2023)\nWe study the localization and topological transitions of the generalized non-Hermitian SSH models, where the non-Hermiticities are introduced by the complex quasiperiodic hopping and the nonreciprocal hopping. We elucidate the universality of the models and how many models can be mapped to them. Under the open boundary condition, two delocalization transitions are found due to the competition between the Anderson localization and the boundary localization from the nontrivial edge states and the non-Hermitian skin effect. Under the periodic boundary condition, only one delocalization transition is found due to the disappearance of the non-Hermitian skin effect. The winding numbers of energy and the Lyapunov exponents in analytical form are obtained to exactly characterize the two deloaclizateon transitions. It finds that the delocalization transitions don\u2019t accompany the topological transition. Furthermore, the large on-site non-Hermiticity and the large nonreciprocal hopping are all detrimental to the topological transitions. However, the large nonreciprocal hopping enhances the Anderson localizations. The above analyses are verified by calculating the energy gap and the inverse of the participation ratio numerically.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nAs the topological edge states are protected by the symmetry, the topological phases are expected to be immune to the perturbations of disorders [1\u20133]. Nevertheless, the strong disorders induce the destructive interference of scattered waves and lead to the localization of all the states [4, 5]. The presence of the Anderson localized phase accompanies the disappearance of the topological nontrivial phase. The disorders connect the two unrelated quantum states which give rise to the topological Anderson insulators [6\u20138]. Recently, the ability to engineer non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and the related observations of unconventional topological edge modes attract a great interest to extend the topological band theory to non-Hermitian systems [9]. The interplays between the topology and non-Hermiticity result in a plethora of exotic phenomena that have no Hermitian counterparts, e.g., the Weyl exceptional ring [10], the point gap [11]. In particular, the realization of the nonreciprocal hopping induces the non-Hermitian skin effect. Comparing to the Hermitian case where the zero-energy states are localized at the boundary only, the non-Hermitian skin effect results in the asymmetrical localization where not only the nontrivial edge states, but also all the trivial states are localized at the boundary. The competition of the boundary localization and bulk localization must lead to the delocalization transitions. In the presence of the nonHermitian skin effect, a characteristic signature is the breakdown of the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence [9, 12\u201327]. The question arises as to whether or not the delocalization transitions accompany the topological transitions. Where are the phase boundaries and how the non-Hermitian skin effect modifies the phase transitions?\n\u2217 csliu@ysu.edu.cn\nThe Anderson localizations are generally studied with the Aubry-Andre\u0301-Harper (AAH) model which is the periodic lattice modulated by quasiperiodic potential. Quasicrystals constitute an intermediate phase between fully periodic lattices and fully disordered media, showing a long-range order without periodicity [28, 29]. This solves the problems of reliably controlling disorders in solidstate systems where the Anderson localization could only be studied indirectly or through numerical simulations. As the AAH model can be mapped to the lattice version of the two-dimensional integer Hall effect problem, it gives the opportunity to study the Anderson localization and topological properties simultaneously [30, 31]. The exact localization-delocalization transition can be obtained by the duality transformation between real and momentum spaces [32\u201342].\nWhen the non-Hermiticities are further introduced to the AAH model by the complex on-site quasiperiodic potentials, it was found that the self-dual symmetry still determines the transitions from topological nontrivial phase to localized phase [43\u201348]. The quantum phase transitions still have the topological nature characterized by the winding numbers. However, when the nonHermiticity is from nonreciprocal hopping, the induced non-Hermitian skin effect leads to the asymmetric localized states [45, 47, 48]. It find that the Anderson localization is not necessarily in accordance with the topological phase transitions. A dip is found in the quasiperiodic potential dependence of the averaged inverse participation ratios which indicates the delocalization transition [45]. The transition point can be exactly proved by the skin effect rescaling.\nUp to now, the studies of the non-Hermitian topological Anderson transitions mainly focus on the AAH models [38, 44, 45, 48, 49]. The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model for polyacetylene is the simplest one-dimensional topological insulator with the chirality symmetry [50]. As many non-Hermitian models can be mapped to var-\n2 ious non-Hermitian versions of the extended SSH models [27], they have become the typical models to study the non-Hermitian effects. In particular, in the presence of the non-Hermitian skin effect due to the nonreciprocal hopping, the generalized Brillouin zone of the nonHermitian SSH model is proposed to recover the bulkboundary correspondence [12\u201327]. The influence of the non-Hermitian skin effect on disordered SSH model is explored and the result shows that the non-Hermiticity can enhance the topological phase against disorders by increasing bulk gaps [51]. The onset of a mobility edge and the topological phase transition in the disordered SSH chain connected to two external baths was investigated the Lindblad equation method [52]. The localization/delocalization of the disordered chain can be recovered by the scaling properties of the nonequilibrium stationary current. However, the winding numbers and\nLyapunov exponents in analytical forms are still lacking to characterize the relationship between the topological transitions and Anderson transitions. In this paper, we study the non-Hermitian generalized SSH model, where the non-Hermiticities are introduced by both the complex quasiperiodic modulation hopping and the nonreciprocal hopping. The main results of this article include the following: (i) We find the equivalence and the universality of the models connected by the similarity transformation. (ii) The winding numbers and the Lyapunov exponents in analytic form are obtained to characterize the topological transition and localization transition. (iii) We clarify the origin of the two delocalization transitions. (iv) The influences of nonHermiticities on the localizations and topological phase transitions are given. The rest of paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II we present the Hamiltonian of the generalized nonHermitian SSH model and its various equivalent models. We explain the equivalence of the hopping terms and elucidate why the complex quasiperiodic modulation hopping can be applied in any of the terms. We also clarify how the nonreciprocal hopping can be transformed from one form to another by the similarity transformations. The winding numbers and the Lyapunov exponents are derived in Sec. III to characterize the topological transition and the Anderson transition. In Sec. IV, the phase diagram of the model is obtained by calculating the inverse of participation ratio. A brief summary is presented in Sec. V."

The irrational number is usually taken by the value of the inverse of golden ratio [\u03b2 = ( \u221a 5 \u2212 1)/2] which in practice approximated by rational numbers \u03b2 = Fn/Fn+1 with the nth Fibonacci number Fn. The nth Fibonacci number Fn = Fn\u22121 + Fn\u22122 and the 1th and 2th Fibonacci numbers are assumed to be F1 = 1 and F2 = 1 respectively. In numerical simulations, a finite (yet arbitrarily large) number of lattice sites L = Fn+1 is assumed usually to eliminate the domain wall of the PBC and to reduce the finite-size effects. The quasiperiodic term t1,n acts as the disorders and induces localizations of the states. It should be emphasized that t1,n, t2 and t3 are equivalent and the quasiperiodicity can be set to any of the terms. The reason is the model in Fig. 1 (a) is equivalent to the two-leg ladder model [pictorially shown in Fig. 1 (b)]. Exchanging t1,n and t2 terms, the AB lattice of the model becomes merely the BA lattice which corresponds to relabeling bn \u2192 bn+1. Similarly, the model remains unchanged when exchanging t2 and t3 terms.\n3 The introduction of parameters \u03b32 and \u03b33 do not lose the universality since the asymmetry of hopping t2\u00b1\u03b32 = \u03c4\u00b1 = t\u03042e\n\u00b1\u03c62 and t3 \u00b1 \u03b33 = t\u03043e\u00b1\u03c63 can be shifted from one term to another with the similarity transformations under the open boundary condition (OBC) [27]. After the similarity transformations, we obtain the equivalent models. For example, under the OBC, the Hamiltonian of this model in Eq. (1) can be transformed into\nH\u0302 = \u03a8\u0302\u2020h\u0302\u03a8\u0302 = \u2211\nn\n[\nt1,na\u0302 \u2020 nb\u0302n + t1,nb\u0302 \u2020 na\u0302n (3)\n+ (t2 \u2212 \u03b32) r\u221211 a\u0302\u2020n+1b\u0302n + (t2 + \u03b32) r1b\u0302\u2020na\u0302n+1 +(t3 \u2212 \u03b33) r1a\u0302\u2020nb\u0302n+1 + (t3 + \u03b33) r\u221211 b\u0302\u2020n+1a\u0302n ] ,\nby the similarity transformation h\u0302 = S\u221211 hS1 and \u03a8\u0302 = S\u221211 \u03a8 with\nS1 = diag{r1, r1, r21 , r21 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , r L/2 1 , r L/2 1 }. (4)\nWhen r1 = e \u03c63 , the non-Hermiticity in t3 term is killed and the non-Hermiticity is transformed into t2 term completely. However, when r1 = e\n\u2212\u03c62 , the non-Hermiticity in t2 term is eliminated and the non-Hermiticity remains in t3 term. In such case r1 = e \u2212\u03c62 , further doing the transformation h\u030c = S\u221212 h\u0302S2 and \u03a8\u030c = S \u22121 2 \u03a8\u0302 with\nS2 = diag{1, r2, r2, r22, r22 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , r L/2\u22121 2 , r L/2\u22121 2 , r L/2 2 }, (5)\nand r2 = e \u2212(\u03c62+\u03c63)/2, the model in Eq. (3) becomes\nH\u030c = \u03a8\u030c\u2020h\u030c\u03a8\u030c = \u2211\nn\n[ t1,nr \u22121 2 a\u030c \u2020 nb\u030cn + t1,nr2b\u030c \u2020 na\u030cn (6)\n+t\u03042a\u030c \u2020 n+1b\u030cn + t\u03042b\u030c \u2020 na\u030cn+1 + t\u03043a\u030c \u2020 nb\u030cn+1 + t\u03043b\u030c \u2020 n+1a\u030cn\n]\n.\nThe non-Hermiticity in t3 term is transformed into t1 term. It is easy to define the unity operator U which transforms the Numb creation operator \u03a8\u2020 in Eq. (1) to\n\u03a6\u2020 = \u03a8\u2020U = ( a\u20201, b \u2020 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, a\u2020L, b \u2020 L ) U\n= ( a\u20201, a \u2020 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7, a\u2020L,\u2212ib \u2020 1,\u2212ib\u20202, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7,\u2212ib\u2020L )\n= ( u\u2020, v\u2020 ) .\nWith the unity operator U , the Hamiltonian h in Eq. (1) under the PBC can be transformed into two block off-diagonal form\nh\u0303 = U \u2020hU = \u2212ih\u0303+\u03c3+ + ih\u0303\u2212\u03c3\u2212 (7)\nhere\nh\u0303+ =\n\n    \nt1,n t3 \u2212 \u03b33 t2 \u2212 \u03b32 t2 \u2212 \u03b32 t1,n . . . . . . t1,n t3 \u2212 \u03b33 t3 \u2212 \u03b33 t2 \u2212 \u03b32 t1,n\n\n     ,\nh\u0303\u2212 =\n\n    \nt1,n t2 + \u03b32 t3 + \u03b33\nt3 + \u03b33 t1,n . . . . . . t1,n t2 + \u03b32 t2 + \u03b32 t3 + \u03b33 t1,n\n\n    \nand \u03c3\u00b1 = (\u03c3x \u00b1 i\u03c3y) /2. Under the OBC, there aren\u2019t non-diagonal elements in the matrix h\u0303+ and h\u0303\u2212. In the new Numb operator \u03a6, the Hamiltonian in Eq. (1) becomes H = \u03a6\u2020h\u0303\u03a6 and the eigenfunction is given by h\u0303\u03a6 = En\u03a6. With the block off-diagonal form, the eigenvalue problem turns into\n\u2212ih\u0303+vn = Enun, ih\u0303\u2212un = Envn.\nWe then obtain\nh\u0303+h\u0303\u2212un = E 2 nun, h\u0303\u2212h\u0303+vn = E 2 nvn. (8)\nun and vn can be treated as the single-particle states, and have the same properties. We find the zero-energy states by sovling the Eq. (8). The merit is the dimmension of\nh\u0303+h\u0303\u2212 or h\u0303\u2212h\u0303+ is equal to half of that of h in Eq. (1). Replacing t2 \u2192 \u2212t \u2212 \u2206, t3 \u2192 \u2212t + \u2206, \u03b32 = \u03b33 = \u03b3 and t1,n \u2192 Vj , the non-Hermitian SSH Hamiltonian in Eq. (7) is mapped to non-Hermitian AAH models with p-wave pairing [47]\nH = \u2211\nj\n[\n\u2212 (t+ \u03b3) c\u2020jcj+1 \u2212 (t\u2212 \u03b3) c \u2020 j+1cj\n+\u2206cjcj+1 +\u2206c \u2020 j+1c \u2020 j\n]\n+ \u2211\nj\nVjc \u2020 jcj\n= \u03a8\u0303\u2020Lh\u0303\u03a8\u0303R, (9)\nin the Majorana fermion representation. c\u2020j is the creation operator of a spinless fermion at lattice site j and t is the hopping amplitude and set as the unit energy (t = 1). \u2206 is the p-wave pairing amplitude. The Majorana fermion operator\n\u03a8\u0303\u2020L = ( \u03bdA1 , \u03bd A 2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03bdAL , \u03bdB1 , \u03bdB2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u03bdBL ) ,\nwhere \u03bdAj \u2261 cj + c\u2020j and \u03bdBj \u2261 i(cj \u2212 c \u2020 j) are operators of two Majorana fermions belonging to one physical site. They satisfy relations (\u03bd\u03baj )\n\u2020 = \u03bd\u03baj and {\u03bd\u03baj , \u03bd\u03bbk } = 2\u03b4jk\u03b4\u03ba\u03bb (\u03ba, \u03bb = A,B) [55, 56]. In the case of \u03b3 = 0, localization and topological phase transitions of model (9) have been studied in Ref. [47]."

[12\u201326]. The topological transition can also be studied with its topological equivalent model in conventional BZ introduced in Ref. [27]. However, when the quasiperiodic potential in Eq. (2) is used to depict the disorder, a large order of Fibonacci number must be used to ensure the long term disorder which results in the complexity of the discussion. Alternatively, a phase \u03b4 is usually added in the complex quasiperiodic potential\nVj = 2V cos(2\u03c0\u03b2j + i\u03b1+ \u03b4/L),\nto introduce an additional dimension. The winding number of energy is often used to characterize the topological nontrivial phase and defined as\n\u03bd = lim L\u2192\u221e\n\u222e\nd\u03b4\n2\u03c0i \u2202\u03b4 [ln det (H)] ,\nhere the Hamiltonian H is defined under the PBC [11]. \u03bd can be used to depict how the complex spectral trajectory E encircles a base energy 0 in the complex energy plane, when \u03b4 changes from 0 to 2\u03c0.

We get the parameter \u03c4\u00b1 = t\u03042e \u00b1\u03c62 = t2 \u00b1 \u03b32.

            "heading": "B. Lyapunov exponent",
            "text": "Under the weak disorder perturbations, the energyband structure remains unchanged. For the topological nontrivial Hermitian system, the nontrivial edge states are almost localized at several sites while all the trivial states are Bloch waves and extend in the bulk. In such case, the localization is boundary localization which is from the nontrivial edge states. In the strong disorder case however, the energy-band structure is broken. The localization is determined by Anderson localization where all the states localize in the bulk. The nonreciprocal hopping induces the non-Hermitian skin effect and the asymmetrical (boundary) localization. The strong disorders also break the asymmetrical localization and lead to the Anderson localization. Accompanying the transition from boundary to Anderson localization, a delocalization must occur. The transition from extended to localized phases can be clarified by the Lyapunov exponent \u03b7 which is the inverse of localization length. In the localized phase, the wave function is exponentially decayed in the localization center n0, i.e. exp (\u2212\u03b7 |n\u2212 n0|). Concerning various localizations, four kinds of the Lyapunov exponents are needed to depict the localizations of the model. The first Lyapunov exponent is related to the nontrivial topological state whose definition is based on the transfer matrix approach [60]. If the system under OBC hosts a topological nontrivial state, the block off-diagonal Hamiltonian in Eq. (7) has the zero-energy mode which\nshould satisfy h\u0303+vn = 0. In transfer matrix form, the equation can be rewritten as\n(\nvj+1 vj\n)\n= Tj\n(\nvj vj\u22121\n)\n,\nwith\nTj =\n( \u2212 Vjt3\u2212\u03b33 \u2212 t2\u2212\u03b32 t3\u2212\u03b33\n1 0\n)\n.\nThe transfer matrix of the whole system is given by T = \u03a0Lj=1Tj with the two eigenvalues \u03bb1 and \u03bb2. Supposing |\u03bb1| < |\u03bb2|, the Lyapunov exponent of the edge states is defined as\n\u03b71 = \u2212 lim L\u2192\u221e ln|\u03bb2| L . (13)\nIn order to determine \u03b71, we perform a similarity transformation STjS \u22121 = \u03be\u22121/2T\u0303j with S = diag(\u03be 1/4, \u03be\u22121/4) and\n\u03be = t3 \u2212 \u03b33 t2 \u2212 \u03b32 .\nAfter the similarity transformation, the transfer matrix Tj of the non-Hermitian AB model modulated by disorder is transformed into\nT\u0303j =\n( Vj \u221a \u03be\nt3\u2212\u03b33 1\n1 0\n)\n,\n5 which is a transfer matrix of the Hermitian AA lattice. However, the non-Hermiticity and nontrivial topological properties of the model are transformed into the disorder term and an extra parameter \u03be\u22121/2. The transfer matrix of the whole system is given by T = \u03a0Lj=1Tj = \u03be\u2212L/2\u03a0Lj=1T\u0303j = \u03be \u2212L/2T\u0303 . Due to the deficiency of the edge state in the Hermitian AA lattice, the Lyapunov exponent of the model corresponding to the transfer matrix T\u0303j is zero obviously which lead to the Lyapunov exponent of the edge state \u03b71 = ln\u03be \u22121/2 from the Eq. (13).\nThe second Lyapunov exponent concerns the Anderson localization of all the states. According to the Thouless mechanism, the Lyapunov exponent of the Anderson localized state in the neighborhood of EB can be computed as [61]\n\u03b72 =\n\u222b\nd\u03b5\u03c1 (\u03b5) [ln |\u03b5\u2212 EB| \u2212 ln (\u01eb+)\u2212 ln (\u01eb\u2212)] ,\nwhere \u03c1(\u03b5) is the density of state. The parameters \u01eb+ and \u01eb\u2212 are introduced to reset the energy scale. EB is set to be 0 for the sake of simplicity since \u03b72 is energy-independent according to numerical analysis. \u03b72 is used to characterize the bulk localization. The following derivations of \u03b72 of the model are based on the Ref. [59]. Under the OBC, we therefore obtain the Lyapunov exponent \u03b72,\u00b1 = ln V e\u03b1\n\u01eb\u00b1 where \u01eb\u00b1 =\n\u221a\n(t2 \u00b1 \u03b32) (t3 \u00b1 \u03b33). Since the log function needs V e\u03b1 > \u01eb\u00b1, we can get two localization transition points VL,\u00b1 = e\n\u2212\u03b1\u01eb\u00b1. \u03b72,+ is meaningless since the system has been in Anderson localization phase when V > VL,\u2212 = e\n\u2212\u03b1\u01eb\u2212. When V > VL,+ = e\n\u2212\u03b1\u01eb+, the large quasiperiodic intensity modifies the decay exponent of the Anderson localized state according the formulae exp (\u2212\u03b7 |n\u2212 n0|). So the Lyapunov exponent is given by \u03b72,\u2212 = e\n\u2212\u03b1\u01eb\u2212 which indicates that the onsite non-Hermiticity \u03b1 and the nonreciprocal parameters (\u03b32, \u03b33) are all negative correlation with the Anderson transition. When the localization of the nontrivial topological state is further modulated by the Anderson localization of all the states, it gives the third Lyapunov exponent. Combining the boundary localization of the nontrivial state and bulk localization, the Lyapunov exponent is given by\n\u03b7 = \u03b72,\u2212 \u2212 \u03b71 = ln (V e\u03b1 \u2212 \u03c4\u2212) . (14)\nAs a result, the transition point of the nontrivial topological state is V = e\u2212\u03b1\u03c4\u2212 which equals to the topological transition point VT,\u2212. Under the PBC, the non-Hermitian skin effect vanishes even in the presence of the nonreciprocal hopping. In the absence of the asymmetrical localization, the calculation of Lyapunov exponent can consult the Ref. [47]. We can obtain two values of the fourth Lyapunov exponent \u03b7\u00b1 = ln V e\u03b1\n\u03c4\u00b1 which are the same as the winding numbers.\nSince the log function needs V e\u03b1 > \u03c4\u00b1, we can get two localization transition points V = e\u2212\u03b1\u03c4\u00b1 which are just the topological transition points VT,\u00b1."

            "text": "With the topological transition points VT,\u00b1 and the Anderson transition points VL,\u00b1 in analysis forms, we are ready to concretely discuss the two kinds of transitions and their relations of the model. It is no different that whether the inverse of the golden ratio or rational numbers Fn/Fn+1 is taken to be as \u03b2. When discussing the topological Anderson insulator under the OBC, the nontrivial zero-edge states are protected by the symmetry and the Anderson localized states determined by the disorder intensity, provided L is long enough. Under the PBC, the domain wall forms when bending the chain into a ring. The domain states are protected by the symmetry and can be characterized by the winding number [27, 62]. In particular, the Anderson localized states are from all the states of the ring and the contribution of the domain states is negligible. In addition, an open boundary can be taken as a special domain wall. As we know, the periodic boundary spectra can be well approximated by the open boundary spectra [26, 27]. The argument also supports the fact that we can obtain the same conclusion under two boundary conditions. As the result, we take the quasiperiodic parameter to be \u03b2 = ( \u221a 5 \u2212 1)/2 directly in numerical analysis. The metric is the chain limitation L = Fn+1 can be discarded.\nThe OBC spectra shown in Fig. 2 (a1) and PBC spectra in Fig. (b1) respectively. In the numerical analysis, t2 is set to be a unit parameter and other parameters are t3 = 0.8, \u03b1 = 0.4 and \u03b32 = \u03b33 = \u03b3 = 1/3. Comparing the two energy spectra, the zero-energy states are found in the OBC and PBC chains. To estimate the topological phase transitions, we plot semilog of the lowest |E2n| of the two spectra in Fig. 2 (a2) and (b2) under the two kinds of boundary conditions. It finds that the open/close of the gap in Fig. 2 (b2) is accompanied by the emerging of zero-energy in Fig. 2 (a2). Hence, the dip of the energy in Fig. 2 (b2) can be taken as an indicator to characterize the topological phase transition of the model. The first transition point in Fig. 2 (a1) is consistent with the prediction by the formula VT,\u2212 = \u03c4\u2212e\n\u2212\u03b1 = (t2 \u2212 \u03b3) e\u2212\u03b1 = 0.4469. However, the second transition point VT,+ = \u03c4+e \u2212\u03b1 = (t2 + \u03b3) e \u2212\u03b1 = 0.8938 don\u2019t accompany the gap closing of the OBC spectra in Fig. 2 (a1), and the small dip appears in the PBC energy spectra in Fig. 2 (b2). As previously pointed out, with increasing the disorder intensity V across VT,\u2212, the nontrivial edge state is destroyed. Further increasing the disorder intensity V across VT,+, the system has been in the topological trivial phase. As a result, the topological transition point is VT,\u2212. We will see that the dip near VT,+ is related to the Anderson transition.\nWe calculate the lattice length L dependence of two transition points in Fig. 2 (c) under the two kinds of boundary conditions. It finds that the topological transition approaches VT,\u2212 = \u03c4\u2212e\n\u2212\u03b1 under the OBC when L is larger than 900. Under the PBC however, the chain length L > 500 is enough to ensure the calculation ac-\n6\ncuracy. So L is taken to be 1200 in all the numerical calculations. To verify the effectivity of the above numerical method, we also present the semilog plots of the lowest values of En under the PBC with different chain length: L = F10 = 55 [black line] and L = F16 = 987 [blue line] in Fig. 2 (b2). Corresponding, \u03b2 are taken to be F9/F10 and F15/F16 respectively. In the short lattice length L = F10 = 55 case, the error of the second transition point VT,+ is obvious. With increasing the lattice length L = F16 = 987, all the two transition points are consistent with the case \u03b2 = ( \u221a 5\u2212 1)/2 and L = 1200. To further verify the topological transition of the model, we plot the semilog of the lowest |E2n| of the PBC spectra in Fig. 2 (d1) with different parameters. The amplitude of the quasiperidoic potential V is scaled by VT,\u2212 (d2) and VT,+ (d3) respectively. The two dips collapse to the points which indicate the effectiveness of VT,\u00b1 = \u03c4\u00b1e \u2212\u03b1 . The inverse of the participation ratio IPRn = L \u2211 m=1 |un(xm)|4 can be used to characterize the localization of a normalized state un(xm). For an extended state, IPRn is of the order 1/L, whereas it approaches to 1 for a localized state. When vn is used to calculate IPRn, the conclusions remain unchanged. the localization of the whole system can be characterized by the mean inverse of the participation ratio IPR = \u2211 n IPRn/L. We calculate IPR1 corresponding to the lowest |E2n| shown in Fig. 3 (a) to understand the localization of the nontrivial topological phase. As a demonstration of the topological phase, we also plot the zero-energy number versus V in Fig. 3 (a). In the low V region near VT,\u2212 = e \u2212\u03b1(t2 \u2212 \u03b3) = 0.4469, a dip V \u2248 0.45 dives in Fig. 3 (a). The appearance of the dip (delocalization) accompanying the topological transition is due to the localization competition between the nontrivial edge states and the disorders. The competition leads to the most extended case of the particle distributions (the smallest IPR1) in the transition point. As expected, the zero-energy edge states [Fig. 3 (c1) and (c2)] indicate the system in the topological nontrivial phase when V < VT,\u2212. When V > VT,\u2212, the edge state (nontrivial topological phase) is breakdown. Further increasing V > VT,+ = e \u2212\u03b1(t2 + \u03b3) = 0.8938, the edge state cannot exist. However, the other dip appears at V = 0.89 in Fig. 3 (a) and (b). As the result, the topological transition point is VT,\u2212 = e \u2212\u03b1(t2\u2212\u03b3). The consistence of the above numerical result with the formulae VT,\u2212 verifies that the topological transition accompanies the breakdown of the zero-energy edge state, and the large non-Hermitian parameters \u03b1 and \u03b3 are all detrimental to the topological transition.\n7 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 0.0 0.5\n0 100 1200\n0.0\n0.5\n0 640 1200\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n0 100 11001200\n0.0\n0.5\n0 100 1200\n0.0\n0.5\n0 640 1200\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n0 100 1100\n0.0\n0.5\nV\n(c2)\nVT,+\n(e1)(d1)(c1)\n(b)\nIP R\n(a)\nVL,-\n(d2) (e2)\nV=0.8 V=1.2\n|vn|\n|un|\nV=0.1 V=0.8 V=1.2\nVL,-\nn\nnn\nn\nn\nV=0.1\nn\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\nIP R 1\nN um\nbe r o\nf z er\noen\ner gy\nV\nVT,VT,+\n0.00\n0.35\n0.70\nFIG. 3.

The second row and the third row are the wave-function un and vn of the lowest |E2n| for the three different regions V under the OBC.\nWe calculate the averaged inverse participation ratios (IPR) over the right eigenstates un in Eq. (8) under two kinds of boundary condition in Fig. 3 (b) to understand the Anderson localization. In the low V region near VL,\u2212 = e \u2212\u03b1\u01eb\u2212 = e \u2212\u03b1\u221a(t2 \u2212 \u03b3)(t3 \u2212 \u03b3) = 0.3739, a deep V \u2248 0.38 dives in Fig. 3 (b) under the OBC which is different from that in Fig. 3 (a). The appearance of the dip indicates the Anderson transition of the whole system doesn\u2019t accompany the topological transition which is contrast to the case of IPR1. The inconsistence of the topological transition and Anderson transition can be understood as follow. When calculating IPR, the contribution of edge zero-energy states is negligible. The delocalization transition is due to the localization competition between boundary localization of the bulk states from the non-Hermitian skin effect and the Anderson localization from the disorders. It is that non-Hermitian skin effect leads to all the states to localize at the boundary. In the absence of the non-Hermitian skin effect, all the bulk states are Bloch waves and the nontrivial topological states localize at the boundary. The boundary localization is determined by the nontrivial topological states only, which the Anderson transition accompanies the topological transition. VT,\u2212 > VL,\u2212 also indicates that the topological edge states are protected by the symmetry, even in the non-Hermtian case, and the topological phases are expected to be immune to the perturbations of disorders. Further increasing V (> e\u2212\u03b1\u01eb+), the system has been in the Anderson localization phase. We get the other transition point VT,+ = e \u2212\u03b1\u03c4+ = 0.89. Across the dip, IPR increases remarkably and the system in the Anderson localization phase shown in Fig. 3 (e1) and (e2). In the intermediate region, VL,\u2212 < V < VT,+, the spatial distribution of wave functions is shown in Fig. 3 (d1) and (d2). This transition also occurs under the PBC where IPR increases rapidly across the transition point [bluecircle in Fig. 3 (b)]. In such case, the non-Hermitian skin effect and zero-energy edge states disappear. Therefore, there isn\u2019t the boundary-localization nature. The Anderson localization is completely due to the disorders which lead to the destructive interference of scattered waves. The consistence of the second transition points in Fig. 3 (a) and (b) indicates the delocalizations have the same origin. Although it can be characterized by the winding number, the Anderson localization is unrelated to the topological transition. According to the formula VT,+ = (t2 + \u03b3) e\n\u2212\u03b1, we conclude that the non-Hermitian skin effect enhances the Anderson localization."

            "text": "In summary, we have studied the localization and topological phase transitions of non-Hermitian SSH models, where the non-Hermiticities are introduced by the complex quasiperiodic hopping and the nonreciprocal hopping. In the presence of the nonreciprocal hopping, the\n8 induced non-Hermitian skin effect leads to asymmetric localization of all the states. Under the OBC, increasing the intensity of the complex quasiperiodic hopping destroys the nontrivial zero-energy edge state and asymmetric localized states, and drives all the states into Anderson localized states. The competition between boundary localization and Anderson localization leads to the delocalization transitions. Due to the non-Hermitian skin effect, the localization transitions are not necessarily accompanied by the topological transitions. By analysing the winding number of energy and the Lyapunov exponent, we find the large nonreciprocal hopping is detrimental to the topological phase transitions, and enhances the Anderson localization. However, the large on-site nonHermiticity is always detrimental to the Anderson localization and topological phase transitions. Since the models have many topological equivalent models, the results we studied are useful for further studying the topological Anderson insulator experimentally."
