    "abstractText": "Biotransformations are reactions mediated by microorganisms, such as fungi. These bioreactions have high chemoand stereoselectivity on organic substrates and can be applied in the search for new bioactive compounds. In this study, acanthoic acid (AA) was biotransformed using the fungus Xylaria sp., giving the novel compound 3\u03b2,7\u03b2-dihydroxyacanthoic acid (S1). Both the AA and the product S1 were tested against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. To identify and validate possible biological targets as enzymes or proteins involved in the activity observed in vitro, we used the molecular docking method. Hydroxylation at the C-3 and C-7 positions of the biotransformation product enhanced its activity against Escherichia coli as well as its binding affinity and interactions with superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1; PDB ID 4A7G). Based on our results, the SOD1 enzyme was suggested to be a possible target for the antioxidant activity of product S1.",

            "text": "Biotransformation methods are increasingly being used in chemical procedures for the formation of new products. Biotransformation, or biocatalysts, is a chemical process in which an organic compound is subjected to structural modification via whole-cell or isolated enzymes [1,2]. Whole-cell biocatalysts can be used for different types of processes, such as biotransformation, biodegradation, and fermentation. These processes can involve one or more steps to produce the desired chemicals [3,4]. Xylaria is one of 40 genera belonging to the Xylariaceae family and is globally distributed. Classification at the species level is difficult because of variations in the coloration, shape, size, and developmental stage [5,6]. Previous studies have demonstrated the enzymatic capacity of fungi for the genus Xylaria in biocatalyst processes, such as the\nAntibiotics 2023, 12, 1331. https://doi.org/10.3390/antibiotics12081331 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/antibiotics\nAntibiotics 2023, 12, 1331 2 of 16\nbiotransformation and biodegradation of the synthetic compounds assisting environmental processes [7] and the biotransformation of saponins [8]. In this context, Xylaria is a promising genus in biotransformation methods [5,6]. Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a serious public health issue and has resulted in the search for new antibiotic compounds, such as diterpenes, to improve the therapeutic arsenal used in the treatment of bacterial infections [9]. Casbane diterpene showed biocidal and biostatic activity against several clinically relevant species (bacteria and yeasts) [10]. Conidiogenone D diterpene, isolated from solid fermentation cultures of the endophytic fungus Leptosphaeria sp., showed antibacterial activity against Bacillus cereus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [11]. This bioactive potential has been attributed to the structural diversity of diterpenes [12\u201314]. Some diterpenes have been submitted to biotransformation to improve their bioactivity. For example, the fungal biotransformation of ent-pimaran-dienoic acid resulted in three products, one of which inhibited the growth of the main microbes responsible for tooth decay [15]. Acanthoic acid (AA) is a pimaradiene diterpene with a wide range of pharmacological activities, such as anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetes, liver protection, gastrointestinal protection, and cardiovascular protection activity. Structurally modified AA has cytotoxic and anti-inflammatory activity [16\u201318]. Thus, natural compounds modified via biotransformation are promising in the search for new bioactive compounds. In this work, we reported, for the first time, the biotransformation of AA diterpene using the endophytic fungus Xylaria sp., leading to the dihydroxylated product 3\u03b2,7\u03b2-dihydroxyacanoic acid (S1)."

Bactericidal antimicrobials can act by inhibiting DNA synthesis, RNA synthesis, cellwall synthesis or protein synthesis, and generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) [19,20]. With this in mind, molecular docking simulations were used to show the interaction patterns of AA and S1 with the penicillin-binding protein 2 protein (PBP2; PDB ID 6G9S) [21], DNA gyrase subunit b (GyrB; PDB ID 4DUH) [22], topoisomerase IV (Topo IV; PDB ID 4HZ0) [23] and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1; PDB ID 4A7G) [24] in the hope of finding the mode of action for compounds AA and S1 based on antimicrobial activity. To validate the docking configuration, the co-crystallized inhibitors of each protein were redocked into the active sites of FimH, PBP2, GyrB, Topo IV, and SOD1. This validation confirmed the suitability of the docking protocol used for this study. This was demonstrated by the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) values between the experimental pose of the co-crystallized inhibitor and the docked pose of 1.6146 \u00c5 in PBP2 (PDB ID 6G9S), 0.5448 \u00c5 in GyrB (PDB ID 4DUH), 0.3511 \u00c5 in Topo IV (PDB ID 4HZ0), and 0.7531 \u00c5 in SOD1 (PDB ID 4A7G), and by the ability of the docking conformation to reproduce all the key interactions achieved by the co-crystallized ligands in the active site. The analysis of the results from molecular docking simulations revealed that compound AA demonstrated an affinity for the catalytic site region of PBP2 with a docking score value of 50.47. On the other hand, compound S1 showed a better fit in the catalytic region of SOD1, with a docking score value of 42.45. Moreover, the detailed information and interactions of these ligands with PBP2, SOD1, GyrB, and Topo IV proteins are provided in Table 3.\nAntibiotics 2023, 12, 1331 5 of 16\nAA: acanthoic acid; S1: biotransformation product; KGM: (2S,3S,4S,5S,6R)-2-heptoxy-6-(hydroxymethyl)oxane3,4,5-triol; ET5: (3R,6S)-6-(aminomethyl)-4-(1,3-oxazol-5-yl)-3-(sulfooxyamino)-3,6-dihydro-2H-pyridine-1carboxylic acid; RLI: 4-[[4-[4-methyl-2-(propanoylamino)-1,3-thiazol-5-yl]-1,3-thiazol-2-yl]amino]benzoic acid; 1AV: 7-imidazol-1-yl-2-pyridin-3-yl-[1,3]thiazolo[5,4-d]pyrimidin-5-amine; 12I: 4-(4-methylpiperazin-1yl)quinazoline; A: Alkyl; APS: Amide-Pi Stacked; H: conventional hydrogen bond; PA: Pi-Alkyl; PPS: Pi-Pi Stacked; PS: Pi-Sigma; UDD: Unfavourable donor-donor; UB: Unfavourable Bump.\nIn Figure 3, possible chemical interactions that explain the binding of AA and S1 to the active site of the penicillin-binding protein 2 can be observed. At the Trp370 residue, hydrophobic interactions of the Pi-Alkyl and Pi-Sigma type with aromatic systems occurred.\nAntibiotics 2023, 12, 1331 6 of 16\nAdditionally, there were hydrogen\u2013bonding interactions with the carboxyl functional group of AA. In the case of S1, fewer interactions with the active site residues were identified. In this case, the aromatic systems interacted with the methyl group at position C-10, and hydrogen\u2013bonding interactions occurred between Ser387 and the carbonyl group present in the structure of S1 (Figure 4). In the binding site of the DNA gyrase subunit B (gyrB) protein, the AA ligand was involved in three alkyl-type hydrophobic interactions with Lys103, while hydrogen\u2013bonding interactions with Gly77 were recognized, interacting with the ligand\u2019s carbonyl group. Furthermore, hydrogen\u2013bonding interactions between Asn46 and Gly77, as well as hydrophobic binding to Lys103 in different regions of S1, as shown in Figure 4, were also observed.\nAntibiotics\u00a02023,\u00a012,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 5\u00a0of\u00a05\u00a0 \u00a0\n(sulfooxyamino)-3,6-dihydro-2H-pyridine-1-carboxylic\u00a0 acid;\u00a0 RLI:\u00a0 4-[[4-[4-methyl-2-(propanoylamino)-1,3-thiazol-5-yl]-1,3-thiazol-2-yl]amino]benzoic\u00a0acid;\u00a01AV:\u00a07-imidazol-1-yl-2-pyridin-3yl-[1,3]thiazolo[5,4-d]pyrimidin-5-amine;\u00a012I:\u00a04-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)quinazoline;\u00a0A:\u00a0Alkyl;\u00a0APS:\u00a0 Amide-Pi\u00a0Stacked;\u00a0H:\u00a0conventional\u00a0hydrogen\u00a0bond;\u00a0PA:\u00a0Pi-Alkyl;\u00a0PPS:\u00a0Pi-Pi\u00a0Stacked;\u00a0PS:\u00a0Pi-Sigma;\u00a0 UDD:\u00a0Unfavourable\u00a0donor-donor;\u00a0UB:\u00a0Unfavourable\u00a0Bump.\u00a0\nIn\u00a0Figure\u00a03,\u00a0possible\u00a0chemical\u00a0interactions\u00a0that\u00a0explain\u00a0the\u00a0binding\u00a0of\u00a0AA\u00a0and\u00a0S1\u00a0to\u00a0 the\u00a0active\u00a0site\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0penicillin-binding\u00a0protein\u00a02\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0observed.\u00a0At\u00a0the\u00a0Trp370\u00a0residue,\u00a0 hydrophobic\u00a0 interact ons\u00a0of\u00a0 the\u00a0Pi-Alkyl\u00a0and\u00a0Pi-Sigma\u00a0 type\u00a0with\u00a0aromatic\u00a0systems\u00a0occurred.\u00a0Additionally,\u00a0there\u00a0were\u00a0hydrogen\u2013bonding\u00a0interactions\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0carboxyl\u00a0functional\u00a0group\u00a0of\u00a0AA.\u00a0In\u00a0the\u00a0case\u00a0of\u00a0S1,\u00a0fewer\u00a0interactions\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0active\u00a0site\u00a0residues\u00a0were\u00a0 identified.\u00a0In\u00a0this\u00a0case,\u00a0the\u00a0aromatic\u00a0systems\u00a0interacted\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0methyl\u00a0group\u00a0at\u00a0position\u00a0 C-10,\u00a0 and\u00a0 hydrogen\u2013bondi g\u00a0 interact s\u00a0 occurred\u00a0 between\u00a0 Ser387\u00a0 and\u00a0 the\u00a0 carbonyl\u00a0 group\u00a0present\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0structure\u00a0of\u00a0S1\u00a0(Figure\u00a04).\u00a0\nFigure\u00a03.\u00a0Analysis\u00a0of\u00a0docking\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0active\u00a0site\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a06G9S\u00a0target\u00a0protein\u00a0of\u00a0Escherichia\u00a0coli.\u00a0(a)\u00a0AA.\u00a0\n(b)\u00a0Biotransformation\u00a0product\u00a0S1.\u00a0The\u00a0receptor\u2013ligand\u00a0interaction\u00a0is\u00a0represented\u00a0on\u00a0a\u00a02D\u00a0diagram\u00a0\n(Left)\u00a0and\u00a0a\u00a03D\u00a0diagram\u00a0(Right).\u00a0The\u00a0figure\u00a0was\u00a0generated\u00a0using\u00a0Biovia\u00a0Discovery\u00a0Studio\u00a0Visualizer\u00a0\nsoftware\u00a0(v.\u00a019.1.0.18287,\u00a0BIOVIA,\u00a0San\u00a0Diego,\u00a0CA,\u00a0USA).\u00a0\nIn\u00a0the\u00a0binding\u00a0site\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0DNA\u00a0gyrase\u00a0subunit\u00a0B\u00a0(gyrB)\u00a0protein,\u00a0the\u00a0AA\u00a0ligand\u00a0was\u00a0 involved\u00a0 in\u00a0 three\u00a0 alkyl-type\u00a0 hydrophobic\u00a0 interactions\u00a0with\u00a0 Lys103,\u00a0while\u00a0 hydrogen\u2013 bonding\u00a0interactions\u00a0with\u00a0Gly77\u00a0were\u00a0recognized,\u00a0interacting\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0ligand\u2019s\u00a0carbonyl\u00a0 group.\u00a0Furthermore,\u00a0hydrogen\u2013bonding\u00a0interactions\u00a0between\u00a0Asn46\u00a0and\u00a0Gly77,\u00a0as\u00a0well\u00a0\nAntibiotics 2023, 12, 1331 7 of 16\nAntibiotics\u00a02023,\u00a012,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 5\u00a0of\u00a05\u00a0 \u00a0\nas\u00a0hydrophobic\u00a0binding\u00a0to\u00a0Lys103\u00a0in\u00a0different\u00a0regions\u00a0of\u00a0S1,\u00a0as\u00a0shown\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a04,\u00a0were\u00a0 also\u00a0observed.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFigure\u00a04.\u00a0Analysis\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0docking\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0active\u00a0site\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a04DUH\u00a0target\u00a0protein\u00a0of\u00a0Escherichia\u00a0coli.\u00a0(a)\u00a0\nSubstrate\u00a0AA.\u00a0(b)\u00a0Biotransformation\u00a0product\u00a0S1.\u00a0The\u00a0receptor\u2013ligand\u00a0interaction\u00a0is\u00a0represented\u00a0on\u00a0\na\u00a02D\u00a0diagram\u00a0(Left)\u00a0and\u00a0a\u00a03D\u00a0diagram\u00a0(Right).\u00a0This\u00a0figure\u00a0was\u00a0generated\u00a0using\u00a0the\u00a0Biovia\u00a0Discovery\u00a0\nStudio\u00a0Visualizer\u00a0software\u00a0(v.\u00a019.1.0.18287,\u00a0BIOVIA,\u00a0San\u00a0Diego,\u00a0CA,\u00a0USA).\u00a0\nThe\u00a0interactions\u00a0between\u00a0AA\u00a0and\u00a0S1\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0residues\u00a0present\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0catalytic\u00a0site\u00a0of\u00a0 topoisomerase\u00a0IV\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0observed\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a05.\u00a0Hydrophobic\u00a0pi\u2013alkyl\u00a0interactions\u00a0between\u00a0 His95\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0vinyl\u00a0group\u00a0C15=C16\u00a0of\u00a0AA\u00a0differed\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0hydrogen\u00a0bonding\u00a0between\u00a0 the\u00a0residue\u00a0Asn42\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0carbonyl\u00a0group\u00a0of\u00a0S1.\u00a0\nFigure 4.

            "text": "The high-resolution mass spectrometry\u2013electrospray negative mode, HRMS-ESI (-), spectrum of S1 showed /z 333.2067 [M-H]- and IR spectrum was observed with an OH bond stretching band at 3.423 cm\u22121; these data are compatible to the molecular formula C20H30O4. This translates into two additional hydroxyl groups in the molecule of S1 compared to AA, which was confirmed by NMR data analysis. A comparison between the 1H NMR spectra of AA and S1 showed chemical shifts at \u03b4H 0.95 (s) and \u03b4H 0.97 (s), which could be attributed to the methyl groups Me-17 and Me-20, respectively; their signals did not suffer significant changes. F r methyl Me-18, we observed an increase in the shift from \u03b4H 1.24 to \u03b4H 1.36 (\u2206 = +0.12). The signals for vinylic hydrogens of the olefin group were observed as a double doublet (dd) at \u03b4H 5.85 (J = 17.4 and 10.7 Hz, 1H) to H-15, \u03b4H 4.91 (cis, J = 10.7 and 1.2 Hz, 1H) and \u03b4H 4.96 (trans, J = 17.5 and 1.2 Hz, 1H) to H-16a and H-16b. The signals at \u03b4H 1.85 and 2.08 (J = 17.4, 4.0 and 2.3 Hz, 1H) were attributed to hydrogens H-12a and H-12 .\nAntibiotics 2023, 12, 1331 11 of 16\nBased on the analysis of 13C and 2D NMR data, the signals characteristic to methyl groups at \u03b4C 21.6, \u03b4C 23.6, and \u03b4C 22.5 could be attributed to Me-17, Me-18, and Me-20, respectively. The signal at \u03b4 181.0 was typical to the carboxyl group of pimarane diterpenes and was attributed to C-19. For the olefin carbons, we observed signals at \u03b4C 145.7 (C-9), \u03b4C 119.9 (C-11), \u03b4C 149.7 (C-15), and \u03b4C 109.6 (C-16). The chemical shifts in the carbon C-10, C-12, and C-13 to S1 were similar to those observed for substrate AA. The signal for oximetinic carbon at \u03b4C 70.5 was attributed to C-3, according to the HMBC to Me-18 to 3J HMBC, as well as the HMBC with C-4 (\u03b4C 47.6). In the heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectrum, the signal at \u03b4H 4.12 correlated with \u03b4C 70.5 and was attributed to H-3. The signal at \u03b4C 39.5 was attributed to C-5 based on the HMBC between Me-17 and C-5. The location of the second hydroxylation was defined through the HMBC of H-5 and H-14 with the signal at \u03b4C 72.6 (C-7); this showed the HSQC correlation with signal \u03b4H 3.65, which was to H-7. Moreover, a correlation spin\u2013spin 1H\u20131H was observed for H-5, H-6, H-7, H-8, and H-14, confirming that the second hydroxylation was located at the C-7 position. Chemical shifts in the carbon C-1 (\u03b4C 34.8) and C-2 (\u03b4C 27.5) were compared with data from the literature, showing a similarity to pimarane diterpenes with the C-3 position being hydroxylated [25\u201329]. The NMR, MS and IV spectra for S1 are available in Supplementary Materials. The configuration of carbon C-3 and C-7 was determined based on the coupling constant observed. For H-3 (t, J = 2.8 Hz), equatorial\u2013equatorial coupling with H-2a and H-2b was suggested. The coupling constant for H-7 (ddd, J = 10.1, 9.0, and 4.9 Hz) showed axial\u2013axial coupling with H-6a and H-8 and axial\u2013equatorial coupling with H-6b. Thus, both OH-3 and OH-7 were \u03b2-oriented [30\u201334]. Therefore, the product S1, 3\u03b2,7\u03b2-dihydroxyacanthoic acid is novel and reported here for the first time. The main HMBC and COSY correlations for S1 are shown in Figure 2. Among the natural secondary metabolites, diterpenoids hold significant importance due to their broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. In recent years, several in vitro studies have shown that diterpenoid compounds have the capability to inhibit the growth of different strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which have emerged due to the indiscriminate use of antibiotics [35]. Biotransformation enables the generation of a variety of structural analogs that can be evaluated for their antimicrobial activity, thereby expanding the diversity of compounds available for the development of new therapeutic agents against microbial infections [36,37]. In this context, the fungus Xylaria sp. was employed to biotransform diterpene acanthoic acid, leading to the introduction of hydroxylation at the C-3 and C-7 positions of the resulting compound S1. This modification resulted in a more active molecule against Gram-negative bacteria. Specifically, hydroxylation at these positions improved the antibacterial activity of S1 against E. coli when compared to AA. Studies have reported that bactericidal antimicrobials have an inhibitory action on DNA synthesis, RNA synthesis, cell wall synthesis, and protein synthesis, as well as generating ROS [19,20]. These antimicrobial activities may involve the inhibition of DNA gyrase (Gyr) and topoisomerase IV (Topo IV), two essential enzymes for bacterial survival, as they perform complementary functions in bacterial DNA processing [38]. Penicillinbinding protein 2 (PBP2) is involved in the inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis and belongs to the group of enzymes known as transpeptidases. Penicillin-class antibiotics inhibit transpeptidases, resulting in the disruption of proper bacterial cell wall formation and consequential bacterial death [39]. This mechanism of action demonstrates its overall effectiveness against various bacterial species, including E. coli [21]. Additionally, bacteria employ defense mechanisms, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), to prevent oxidative stress caused by ROS and maintain a cellular redox balance [40]. To obtain a better understanding of the mechanism by which S1 exhibited superior inhibition against E. coli, in silico enzymatic evaluation assays were developed using molecular docking studies. This molecular docking technique was highly useful in determining the binding affinity of drug molecules to the biological target [41]. In this case, the docking\nAntibiotics 2023, 12, 1331 12 of 16\nsimulations evaluated the binding patterns of diterpenoids at the active sites of proteins 6G9S (PBP2), 4DUH (GyrB), 4HZ0 (Topo IV), and 4A7G (SOD1). In this study, a difference in affinity between AA and S1 for the active site region of the analyzed proteins was observed. An analysis of the molecular docking simulations revealed that AA showed an affinity for the catalytic region of PBP2 (PDB ID 6G9S), while S1 exhibited a better fit in the catalytic region of SOD1 (PDB ID 4A7G). It can be observed that AA interacts with residues Trp370, Ser387, and Ser545, which are part of the active site structure of PBP2 from E. coli (Ser330, Thr331, Val332, Lys333, Arg368, Asp369, Trp370, Lys371, Ser387, Ala388, Asp389, Ile453, Gly454, Gln455, Gly456, Lys544, Ser545, Gly546, and Thr547) [21]. This result suggests that the inhibition pathway of AA likely has an affinity for the same active site region as penicillin-class antibiotics [39], indicating its role in disrupting the proper formation of the bacterial cell wall. The docked pose clearly showed that both AA and S1 bound within the active site of the SOD1; however, the binding mode was improved in S1 because of significant hydrogen bonding within the catalytic active site with Ser25, Val103, Ile104, Ser105, Asp109, and His110. This result suggests that S1 inhibits E. coli via the superoxide dismutase pathway. Hydrogen bonds play a central role in protein\u2013ligand binding affinity, including enzymatic catalysis, to stabilize a ligand in a binding pocket [42,43]. Published results regarding the antimicrobial activity of pimarane diterpenes against different bacteria indicate that the presence of a hydrogen-bond donor group (HBD) is important for the antimicrobial activity of diterpenes. Moreover, the distance between HDB groups can interfere with antimicrobial activity [44]. Based on the observations above, we could assume that S1 showed improved activity against E. coli because of additional HDB groups at C-3 and C-7, favoring the chemical interactions between S1 and the protein target by the formation of a stable enzyme\u2013substrate complex. Therefore, molecular docking simulations provided a clearer understanding of the mechanisms of action for diterpenes AA and S1 on target proteins, revealing valuable insights into their interactions at the active site. These results contribute to a better comprehension of the results obtained in the in vitro tests. However, further experimental studies are needed to confirm the proposed association between SOD1 and the observed antioxidant activity of S1."
