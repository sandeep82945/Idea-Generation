    "abstractText": "This paper used Hobfoll\u2019s conservation of resources (COR) theory to investigate the extent to which interpersonal and financial resources predict the well-being of salaried employees in the United States. Data were collected from a nationally representative survey of adults in the United States conducted by the RAND Corporation. Two measures of well-being (depressive symptoms and life satisfaction), along with an actual loss of financial resources and a perceived lack of interpersonal and financial resources, were examined. The role of perceived control as a moderator in the relationship between resource deficit perceptions and wellbeing was also examined. The results of the regression analysis indicate that the perceived lack of resources was associated with a decline in well-being. Perceived control was found to buffer the negative effects of resource deficit perceptions. Employees with high levels of perceived control showed less of a reduction in well-being than those with low levels of perceived control as the perceived deficit of resources increased. The study also revealed that actual loss of resources, measured as a decrease in wages, is associated with a decrease in life satisfaction but is not associated with depressive symptoms. We conclude by discussing the theoretical and practical implications of our research on the relationship between resource deficits and well-being during a public health crisis.",

Evidence of the negative effects of the pandemic on people\u2019s well-being is accumulating. Several authors have emphasized the relationship between well-being and the socioeconomic status during the pandemic (Wanberg et al., 2020). Others have focused on well-being and employment situations (Wolfe & Patel, 2021). In addition, some authors have emphasized well-being as a function of resources (Youngmann & Kushnirovich, 2021). We focus on this last line of research on well-being, with a particular emphasis on actual resource losses and perceived lack of resources, as well as the role of perceived control over one\u2019s life as a moderator in the relationship between resource perceptions and employee well-being. Because perceptions of one\u2019s resources are crucial to one\u2019s well-being, it is important to consider them. Individuals are more likely to act, behave, and form attitudes based on perceptions than on any objective reality (Van den Broeck et al., 2014). Perceptions about one\u2019s resources may be formed on the basis of individual factors (individual competence, needs, and wants) and contextual features (workload, work environment, and rapid change in the financial markets) and their interaction. Therefore, perceptions about one\u2019s resources are integrative or holistic. The uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has evoked resource deficit perceptions in individuals. The same level of resources may indicate contentment for one individual but be overwhelming for another due to differences in responsibilities and expenditures (Leana & Meuris, 2015).\nPerceptions of a lack of resources are even more detrimental to the well-being of individuals with lower perceived control over their life outcomes (Lachman, 2006). Given the decline in well-being, widespread loss of resources, and perceived deficit of resources during this ongoing pandemic, the first objective of this study is to examine the extent to which actual and perceived resource deficits (deficits of interpersonal and financial resources) are associated with reduced well-being during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic for employees in the United States, after controlling for socioeconomic status, demographic factors, and general health status. The second objective of our study is to assess the role of perceived control as a moderator in the relationship between perceived resource deficits and well-being. Our study presents unique, nationally representative data collected in the United States. Using the conservation of resources (COR) theory, our study addresses the need to better understand the resource-based mechanisms that affect the well-being of employees amid this public health crisis. From a practical viewpoint, employee stress and a lack of well-being impose a significant financial burden on organizations in terms of absenteeism and reduced productivity (Cartwright & Cooper, 1997). It is, therefore, informative for organizations to understand employee well-being and the underlying resource-based mechanisms and perceptions (Christie & Barling, 2009). Our study contributes to the existing literature in three ways: It expands the literature on individual perceptions of resource deficits during the COVID19 pandemic and the association of such perceptions with two indicators of well-being: depressive symptoms and life satisfaction. It contributes to our understanding of the COR by examining how perceptions of resource deficits due to an external disruptive event are associated with well-being. Finally, we explore the role of perceived control in moderating the negative impact of perceived resource deficits on well-being.\nIn the following sections, we elaborate on theoretical arguments using existing empirical findings to develop our hypotheses. We then employ multiple regression analysis to test our hypotheses using data collected during the early stages of the COVID\u201019 pandemic in the United States. We conclude by discussing the theoretical and practical implications of our research on the relationship between resource deficits and well-being during a public health crisis."

            "text": "The COR offers a theoretical framework for understanding the association between one\u2019s resources and well-being. Specifically, COR theory is a resource-oriented model of well-being that posits (a) that individuals have a fundamental motivation to build, retain, and protect valued resources and (b) that the actual or perceived lack of resources produces stress and reduces well-being. Resources include objects (e.g., home, car), conditions (job security, a good marriage), personal resources (mastery, perceived control, self-efficacy, optimism, confidence), and energies (money, knowledge). Resources are linked to well-being because they enable people (a) to self-regulate their emotions, actions, behaviors, and attitudes; (b) to have meaningful life experiences; and (c) to define their roles and identities in their social ecology (Hobfoll, 1989, 2010; Roskies & Louis\u2010 Guerin, 1990). There is robust cross-sectional and longitudinal evidence supporting the COR theory. This evidence has been obtained across a wide variety of countries and contexts and has been supported in numerous disaster contexts, including the COVID-19 pandemic (Sattler et al., 2002; Shannonhouse et al., 2019; Wanberg et al., 2020).\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is characterized by either the actual loss of resources or the perceived threat to resources for individuals worldwide. Millions of employees were furloughed or laid off from their jobs or began working virtually or on-site under changed conditions. In the United States, millions of households reported having insufficient food and falling behind on rent. Furthermore, the stock market decline caused financial instability (Wolfson & Leung, 2020). High unemployment, food insecurity, and the instability of the financial markets reflect the loss of economic and financial resources. Family routines were disrupted due to school and daycare closures. Several services, public transportation, and entertainment options became limited or unavailable. In addition, the social distancing imposed to prevent the spread of the virus created loneliness and social isolation, reflecting a loss of social and interpersonal resources (Kim & Laurence, 2020). Of the many resources that fall under the umbrella of COR, we consider three key resources: financial resources, interpersonal resources, and personal control over one\u2019s life. Financial resources allow people to satisfy their needs and pursue many other goals in life. Income and wealth enhance an individual\u2019s freedom to live the life of their choosing (Annink et al., 2016). Loss of financial resources (e.g., decrease in wages), on the contrary, creates stress, anxiety, and depression and reduces well-being (Youngmann & Kushnirovich, 2021). Widespread loss of financial resources has been reported during this COVID-19 pandemic. Many people suffered a decline in wages due to COVID-19. Given the above, we expect the following hypotheses:\nH1a: Loss of financial resources will be positively associated with depressive symptoms.\nH1b: Loss of financial resources will be negatively associated with life satisfaction.\nWhile many people suffered actual losses of financial resources during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as decreases in wages, others were overwhelmed due to financial obligations and responsibilities. In other words, individuals who did not have enough financial resources to meet\nThe Role of Personal Control as a Moderator 1835\ntheir needs perceived a lack of financial resources. Therefore, the term \u201cperceived lack of financial resources\u201d refers to financial worries and the perception of overwhelming financial obligations. Previous research has shown that individuals who perceive a lack of financial resources report a reduced sense of well-being (Annink et al., 2016). Given the above, we expect the following hypotheses:\nH2a: The perceived lack of financial resources will be positively associated with depressive\nsymptoms.\nH2b: The perceived lack of financial resources will be negatively associated with life satisfaction.\nInterpersonal resources refer to having social support, social integration, or connectedness (Link & Phelan, 1995). In contrast, the term \u201cperceived lack of interpersonal resources\u201d refers to feelings of a lack of support and interpersonal connections, and such perceptions are linked with depressive symptoms (Teo et al., 2013). In a cross-national sample following Hurricane Georges, perceived social support was inversely related to psychological distress (Sattler et al., 2002). In the context of COVID-19, people were isolated from family and friends due to the lockdown and limited public transportation and entertainment options, and as a result, they reported anxiety and depression (Kim & Laurence, 2020). Therefore, we propose the following hypotheses:\nH3a: The perceived lack of interpersonal resources will be positively associated with depressive\nsymptoms.\nH3b: The perceived lack of interpersonal resources will be negatively associated with life\nsatisfaction."

            "text": "The COR theory suggests that people use the resources they already possess to offset resource deficits and build up other resources. For example, individuals may possess characteristics or traits such as resilience, self-esteem, hardiness, perceived control, and optimism, among others. These personal characteristics improve an individual\u2019s ability to cope with stress as well as act as a buffer against the negative effects of resource deficits. This paper considers one such personal characteristic, \u201cperceived control,\u201d which is the belief that one can influence one\u2019s situation/environment, determine one\u2019s behavior, and bring about desired outcomes. Individuals report a higher level of well-being when they can fulfill their goals, successfully solve their problems, and influence their life situations to bring about desired outcomes (Dulin et al., 2013; Lachman & Weaver, 1998). Recent research has shown that perceived control acts as a protective factor, buffering the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on general health and life satisfaction (Zheng et al., 2020).\nIt is argued that greater perceived control over one\u2019s situations enables individuals to effectively utilize resources, enhancing the individual\u2019s capability to handle stress (Alonso-Ferres et al., 2020; Lachman, 2006; Thompson & Prottas, 2006). Additionally, a sense of control alters an individual\u2019s perception of their capacity to handle the environment, which changes their perception of a threat (De Witte, 2005). This may mean that individuals with greater perceived control are better able to cope with the stress of resource deficits. Specifically, resource deficit perceptions may be less\nstressful for individuals with greater perceived control. Therefore, perceived control is a protective mechanism that buffers the negative impacts of resource deficits. Given the direct and indirect effects of perceived control on well-being, we expect the following hypotheses:\nH4a: Perceived control will be negatively associated with depressive symptoms.\nH4b: Perceived control will be positively associated with life satisfaction.\nH5a: Perceived control will moderate the relationship between the perceived lack of resources and\ndepressive symptoms.\nH5b: Perceived control will moderate the relationship between the perceived lack of resources and\nlife satisfaction.\nBased on the COR theory, we test a conceptual model proposing that (a) actual and perceived deficits of resources will impair well-being and that (b) perceived control over life outcomes will improve well-being as well as moderate the relationship between perceived deficits and well-being (see Figure 1)."

Data were collected from April 16 to April 19, 2020, during the first estimated peak of the COVID-19 pandemic (Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation [IHME], 2020). The RAND Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved all study procedures. This survey included questions on the perceived lack of financial resources and perceived lack of interpersonal resources since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as perceived control, a decrease in wages due to COVID-19, depressive symptoms, and life satisfaction. The participation rate was 64.5%, with 1143 adults responding to the survey. For the purposes of this study, we only included salaried employees\nThe Role of Personal Control as a Moderator 1837\n(employed full-time and part-time only, n = 456). Eighty-seven percent of full-time employees worked in health, education, sales, finance, or administration. The respondent\u2019s mean age in our study was 52 years (SD = 13). Demographic data for the sample are shown in Table 1. Females made up 58.1% of the total respondents, while males made up 41.9% of the total.\nTable 1: Socio-Demographic Characteristics of Respondents\nCharacteristics N %\nGender\nMale 191 41.9\nFemale 265 58.1\nEducation\nSome high school, no diploma 3 0.7 High school graduate or equivalent 37 8.1 Some college, no degree 95 20.8 Associate degree 57 12.5 Bachelor\u2019s degree 143 31.4 Master\u2019s degree 84 18.4 Professional school degree 16 3.5 Doctorate degree 21 4.6\nIncome\nLess than 5,000 5 1.1 5,000-7,499 3 0.7 7,500-9,999 2 0.4 10,000-12,499 2 0.4 12,500-14,999 5 1.1 15,000-19,999 7 1.5 20,000-24,999 7 1.5 25,999-29,999 11 2.4 30,000-34,999 18 3.9 35,000-39,999 15 3.3 40,000-49,999 32 7.0 50,000-59,999 34 7.5 60,000-74,999 69 15.1 75,000-99,999 62 13.6 100,000-124,999 60 13.2 125,000-199,999 73 16.0\n200,000 or more 50 11.0\nRace\nWhite 349 76.5 Non-White 107 23.5\n3.2. Measures\nDependent variables: Depressive symptoms were measured with eight items (e.g., \u201cOver the last 2 weeks, how frequently have you felt down, depressed, or hopeless?\u201d) on a 4-point scale (1 = not at all to 4 = nearly every day). Cronbach\u2019s alpha for this scale was .87. The average of item responses indicates the overall level of depressive symptoms. Life satisfaction was assessed with a single item (1 = very dissatisfied to 10 = very satisfied).\nIndependent variables: The perceived lack of financial resources was measured using three items; for example, \u201cSince the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, how often have you been worried about your financial situation?\u201d (Wanberg et al., 2020). These items were measured on a 5-point scale (1 = never to 5 = always). Higher scores reflect a greater lack of or more worries about one\u2019s financial resources. Cronbach\u2019s alpha for this scale was .858. The average of item responses indicates the overall level of perception of one\u2019s financial resource deficits. Actual loss of financial resources was measured with a single item (1 = decrease in wages due to COVID-19, 0 = no decrease in wages due to COVID-19).\nThe perceived lack of interpersonal resources was assessed using three items; for example, \u201cSince the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, how often have you felt isolated from others?\u201d (Hughes et al., 2004). These items were measured on a 3-point scale (1 = hardly ever, 3 = often). Higher scores reflect a greater perceived lack of one\u2019s interpersonal resources. Cronbach\u2019s alpha for this scale was .84. The average of item responses indicates the overall level of perceived lack of interpersonal resources.\nPerceived control over one\u2019s life was measured using seven items; for example, \u201cI have a great deal of control over the things that happen to me\u201d (Lachman & Weaver, 1998). These items were measured on a 4-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 4 = strongly agree). Higher scores reflect greater personal control over one\u2019s life. Cronbach\u2019s alpha for this scale was .812. The average of item responses indicates the overall level of perceived control.\nControl variables: Socioeconomic status was determined by (a) educational attainment and (b) annual household income. Respondents reported their level of education on a 9-point scale (1 = less than high school, 9 = doctorate degree). For analysis purposes, respondents were categorized as \u201cbachelor or above\u201d or \u201cother.\u201d Those with a bachelor\u2019s degree or less were assigned to the \u201cother\u201d category. Fifty-eight percent of the respondents in the sample reported having a bachelor\u2019s degree or above, while 42% reported having less than a bachelor\u2019s degree. Annual household income represents the total income of all family members 15 years of age or older on a 17-point scale (1 = less than $5000, 17 = $200,000 or above). Approximately 70% of the employees in our sample earned an annual income of $60,000 or more.\nAge and general health status were controlled because they are risk factors for COVID-19. General health status was measured with a single item (1 = poor to 5 = excellent). Race was controlled since racial disparities exist in health outcomes (House & Williams, 2000). To assess racial group membership, surveyors asked respondents to identify their race: \u201cWhat race do you consider yourself to be?\u201d For analysis purposes, respondents were categorized as \u201cWhite\u201d or \u201cother.\u201d White respondents made up 76.5% of the sample, while other respondents accounted for 23.5%. We controlled for gender because previous research indicates that women experience more depressive symptoms than men (Salk et al., 2017).\nThe Role of Personal Control as a Moderator 1839\n3.3. Methodology\nFirst, we present frequencies, descriptive statistics, and bivariate correlation (see Tables 1, 2, 3a, 3b, and 4). Second, we conducted multiple regression analyses to examine the potential effects of actual and perceived lack of resources on well-being, as well as the moderating effects of perceived control on the relationship between perceived lack of resources and well-being. Weights were incorporated into the estimation of coefficients. Specifically, six regression models were estimated to predict well-being. Three regression models were estimated to predict depressive symptoms (see Table 5) and life satisfaction (see Table 6). In the first model, socioeconomic status, demographic variables, and general health status were included. In the second model, resources (decrease in wages due to COVID-19, perceived lack of financial resources, perceived lack of interpersonal resources, and perceived control) were included. All of the variables mentioned above, as well as the two interaction terms expressing the interaction between resource deficit perceptions and perceived control, were included. The focus of the regression analyses is on the strength and form of the relationships between well-being (depressive symptoms and life satisfaction) and resources. Comparing the R-squared and coefficients of the baseline model with those of the subsequent ones enables us to examine how resource perception variables relate to well-being in the presence of socioeconomic, demographic, and general health status. We conducted a series of tests to detect multicollinearity among the independent variables in these linear regression models. First, bivariate correlations among the independent variables were low. Second, and most importantly, the variance inflation factors (VIF) in each of these models remained sufficiently below 20."

Almost 60% of the respondents in this study sample reported being worried about their financial situation since the start of the pandemic. On a scale from 1 to 10, 86% of respondents reported a score of 6 or above for life satisfaction. With respect to depressive symptoms, approximately 62% of the respondents reported feeling tired or having very little energy. In terms of socioeconomic status and demographic variables, 58% of the respondents in this study sample reported attaining a bachelor\u2019s degree or above. Approximately 70% of the employees in our study sample earned an annual income of $60,000 or more. Fifty-eight percent were females, and 42% were males. The average age of our study sample respondents was 52 years.\nWe performed bivariate correlation analyses between all independent variables as well as the two dependent variables. Overall, perceived lack of interpersonal resources is positively correlated with depressive symptoms (r = 0.46, p < 0.01) and negatively correlated with life satisfaction (r = \u22120.39, p < 0.01), suggesting that individuals who perceive themselves as socially isolated and disconnected report lower well-being. Perceived lack of financial resources is positively correlated with depressive symptoms (r = 0.37, p < 0.01) and negatively correlated with life satisfaction (r = \u22120.32, p < 0.01), suggesting that individuals who are worried and overwhelmed about their financial situation report lower well-being. Perceived control over life outcomes is negatively correlated with depressive symptoms (r = \u22120.46, p < 0.01) and positively correlated with life\nsatisfaction (r = 0.42, p < 0.01), suggesting that individuals who perceive themselves to be in control of their lives report higher well-being. The actual loss of resources, as measured by a decrease in wages, is negatively correlated with life satisfaction (r = \u22120.10, p < 0.05) but not with depressive symptoms, suggesting that individuals who suffer a decrease in wages due to the COVID-19 pandemic report a lower level of life satisfaction. Age is negatively correlated with depressive symptoms (r = \u22120.32, p < 0.01) and is positively correlated with life satisfaction (r = \u22120.32, p < 0.01). This means that older employed individuals report higher levels of well-being. Older employed individuals also report a higher level of perceived control over their lives (r = 0.11, p < 0.05). Females perceive a greater deficit of financial resources (r = 0.15, p < 0.01) and report earning less annual income compared to their male counterparts (r = \u22120.14, p < 0.01).

Together, these variables explain 48% of the variation in depressive symptoms. In this model, we found that perceived control has a negative moderating effect (coefficient of \u22120.13) on the relationship between perceived lack of interpersonal resources and depressive symptoms. This means that, when the perceived deficit of interpersonal resources is higher, employees who perceive a higher level of control over their lives report lower levels of depressive symptoms than employees who perceive a lower level of control. Said in another way, employees with high perceived control were protected from the negative effects of perceived lack of interpersonal resources to some extent (see Figure 2). Perceived control over life outcomes is an important protective personal characteristic in situations where the perceived lack of interpersonal resources is high. Furthermore, in Model 3, we found that the coefficient of perceived lack of interpersonal resources increases, suggesting that the relationship between resource deficit perceptions and depressive symptoms is dependent on the interaction with perceived control. It is interesting to note that the interaction between the perceived deficit of financial resources and perceived control is not significant. This means that perceived control can buffer the adverse effects of perceived interpersonal resource deficits but not financial resource deficits, suggesting only partial support for hypothesis H5a."

            "text": "Using a nationally representative sample during the first peak of the pandemic in the United States, this paper contributes to an emerging body of research on well-being by explicating the association between actual and perceived resource deficits and well-being reduction. We examined two indicators of well-being: depressive symptoms and life satisfaction. This study revealed that the actual loss of resources, as measured by a decrease in wages, has no effect on depressive symptoms. However, life satisfaction is negatively associated with the decrease in wages due to the COVID19 pandemic. Consequently, actual resource loss is salient for predicting life satisfaction but not depressive symptoms. Another contribution of this study is that it distinguished between three perceptions of resource deficits in terms of their saliency and strength in predicting well-being. The three perceptions of resource deficits considered were: perceived deficits of interpersonal resources, perceived deficits of financial resources, and perceived control. The role of perceived control as a moderator in the relationship between perceived resource deficits and well-being was also examined.\nOur study showed that during the first peak of the pandemic in the United States, more than half of the respondents in our study sample felt isolated from others (see Table 2). Such perceptions of a lack of interpersonal resources, that is, social isolation and disconnection, are associated with lower well-being, as measured by an increase in depressive symptoms and a lack of life satisfaction. Perceptions of discontent with interpersonal resources are a stronger predictor of\nThe Role of Personal Control as a Moderator 1847\ndepressive symptoms as compared to life satisfaction. The increase in depressive symptoms due to the perceived lack of interpersonal resources is much higher for individuals who perceive a lower degree of control over their life outcomes. With regard to financial resources, more than half of the respondents in our study sample reported being worried and overwhelmed about their financial situation (see Table 2). Such perceptions of dissatisfaction with financial resources are associated with lower life satisfaction. The decrease in life satisfaction due to the perceived lack of financial resources is much higher for individuals who perceive a lower level of control over their life outcomes.\nWe examined the direct and moderating effects of perceived control on well-being. Theoretically, our aim was to test the conservation of resources theory, which states that to compensate for resource deficits, individuals utilize certain personal traits, such as perceived control, which is the belief that one can influence one\u2019s situation/environment and produce favorable outcomes. The results suggested that perceived control was associated with a decrease in depressive symptoms and an increase in life satisfaction. Employees with high levels of perceived control showed less of a reduction in well-being than those with low levels of perceived control as the perceived deficit of resources increased."

As a result, one can conclude that the results obtained are representative of salaried employees in the United States. However, the study has several limitations. The data presented in this study comes from a crosssectional survey conducted during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Because of the cross-sectional nature of the survey, it is difficult to draw confident causal conclusions. This study is also limited by its use of self-reported perceptions of resources and wellbeing. Future research should use objective measures of well-being such as recorded sick days, absolute income in dollar amounts before and after the pandemic, and the absolute number of social connections before and after the pandemic. Longitudinal data are required to examine the longterm effects, as the study is limited to the initial peak of the pandemic. Since the first wave/peak of the pandemic, there has been an increase in human suffering, resource losses, and the perceived lack of resources, so longitudinal data is needed to better understand the association between resource losses and well-being."

In conclusion, the study revealed that depressive symptoms are higher among employees who perceive a lack of resources. Interestingly, depressive symptoms are not associated with the actual loss of resources. Interpersonal resources are more salient and stronger predictors of depressive symptoms compared to financial resources. Life satisfaction, on the other hand, is lower for employees who suffer actual losses of resources\nas well as for those who perceive a lack of resources. Financial resources are more pronounced predictors of life satisfaction than interpersonal resources. According to the findings of this study, employees with lower levels of perceived control over their lives experienced a greater increase in depressive symptoms as perceived lack of interpersonal resources increased. In addition, employees with lower levels of perceived control over their lives showed a greater decrease in life satisfaction as perceived lack of financial resources increased. The findings of this study are relevant not only for the COVID-19 pandemic but also for explaining factors predicting well-being during any crisis. Furthermore, the findings highlight the significance of an individual\u2019s perceived lack of resources during a crisis in explaining depressive symptoms and life satisfaction among employees in the United States. These findings may help organizational decision-makers develop tailored economic and social resource-based interventions in times of crisis.\nREFERENCES\nAlonso-Ferres, M., Imami, L., & Slatcher, R.
