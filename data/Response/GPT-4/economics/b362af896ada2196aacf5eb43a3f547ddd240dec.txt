Cross-country Analysis on Policy Interventions: Examine the effectiveness of different policy interventions across European countries aimed at reducing digital deprivation among school-aged children. This could include analyzing subsidies for internet and computer access, educational programs for parents, and targeted supports for low-income families or those in severe material deprivation. The goal would be to identify which interventions are most effective and under what conditions.

Longitudinal Impact of Digital Deprivation: Investigate the long-term effects of digital deprivation on educational outcomes, social integration, and future employability of children. This research could use longitudinal data to track digitally deprived children over time, comparing their progress with peers who had adequate digital access.

Digital Skills Development and Usage: While the paper discusses digital deprivation in terms of access, future research could focus on the 'second-level' digital divide related to digital skills and usage. This could explore how children with newly acquired digital access develop digital skills and how these skills impact their educational and social outcomes.

Role of Educational Institutions in Mitigating Digital Deprivation: Analyze the potential role of schools and other educational institutions in mitigating digital deprivation. This research could explore how schools can provide digital access and skills training, particularly in areas with high levels of digital deprivation, and the impact of such initiatives on closing the digital divide.

Socio-economic Characteristics and Digital Deprivation Dynamics: Conduct in-depth analyses of how socio-economic characteristics influence the dynamics of digital deprivation over time, especially in the context of economic downturns or crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. This research could focus on vulnerable groups identified in the paper, such as children from single-parent households, immigrant families, or large families, to understand how their digital deprivation changes in response to external shocks and policy interventions.
