    "abstractText": "Synthesizing arylamines with high selectivity via hydrogenation of nitroaromatics is a long-standing challenge because of the complex reaction pathways. Revealing the route regulation mechanism is the key to obtain high selectivity of arylamines. However, the underlying reaction mechanism of route regulation is uncertain owing to a lack of direct in situ spectral evidence of the dynamic transformation of intermediate species during the reaction process. In this work, by using in situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), we have employed 13 nm Au100\u2212xCux nanoparticles (NPs) deposited on a SERS-active 120 nm Au core to detect and track the dynamic transformation of intermediate species of hydrogenation of para-nitrothiophenol (p-NTP) into para-aminthiophenol (p-ATP). Direct spectroscopic evidence demonstrates that Au100 NPs exhibited a coupling route with the in situ detection of the Raman signal assigned to coupling product p,p-dimercaptoazobenzene (p,p-DMAB). However, Au67Cu33 NPs displayed a direct route without the detection of p,p-DMAB. The combination of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveals that Cu doping can favor the formation of active Cu\u2013H species owing to the electron transfer from Au to Cu, which can promote the formation of phenylhydroxylamine (PhNHOH*) and favor the occurrence of the direct route on Au67Cu33 NPs. Our study provides direct spectral evidence demonstrating the critical role of Cu in route regulation for the nitroaromatic hydrogenation reaction at a molecular level and clarifies the route regulation mechanism. The results have significant implications for revealing multimetallic alloy nanocatalyst mediated reaction mechanisms and help to guide the rational design of multimetallic alloy catalysts for catalytic hydrogenation reactions.",

The combination of X-ray photoelectron\nspectroscopy (XPS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveals that Cu doping can favor the\nformation of active Cu\u2013H species owing to the electron transfer from Au to Cu, which can promote the\nformation of phenylhydroxylamine (PhNHOH*) and favor the occurrence of the direct route on Au67Cu33 NPs.

Although many techniques are available to study the reaction mechanism, the dynamic transformation of intermediate species during the reaction process is difficult to be tracked in real-time owing to their small adsorption amount and short lifetime.12,14\u201317 Therefore, a technique with high sensitivity, is needed urgently to in situ study the route regulation mechanism in real-time over bimetallic alloy NPs.\nSurface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is a promising tool for in situ detecting surface species owing to its ultrahigh surface single-molecule sensitivity.18\u201324 During SERS measurement, the Raman signal from surface species can be amplied by using SERS-active Au23,25 or Ag.26,27 By using its high sensitivity, in situ SERS has been used to detect active species in biological systems by research groups including our group.28\u201335 Recently, it has begun to emerge in the study of the underlying catalytic reaction mechanisms.36\u201338 For example, by using bifunctional Au@Ni3FeOx structures, the Raman signal from intermediate species (O\u2013O\u2212) during the oxygen evolution reaction on Ni3FeOx NPs can be enhanced and seen because of the SERS enhancement from the Au core.39 Besides, the direct spectral evidence of active intermediate species (*OH and *OOH) in the oxygen reduction reaction was obtained on a metal Pt catalyst by using a Au core as the Raman signal enhancer.40 In addition, with the help of in situ SERS, the hydrogen spillover effect,41 size effect,42,43 as well as crystal effect44 were revealed by using the hydrogenation of paranitrothiophenol (p-NTP) to para-aminthiophenol (p-ATP) as a model reaction. That said, SERS is a highly surface-sensitive technique and can be employed to in situ track the dynamic transformation of intermediate species on bimetallic alloy NPs.\nHerein, with hydrogenation of p-NTP to p-ATP as the model reaction, we used in situ SERS to reveal the route regulation mechanism mediated by Au100\u2212xCux alloy nanocatalysts. Specically, 13 nm single-component Au100 NPs, as well as bimetallic Au90Cu10 NPs and Au67Cu33 NPs were prepared and deposited on a SERS-active 120 nm Au core covered with a very thin layer of SiO2, forming Au@SiO2@Au100, Au@SiO2@Au90Cu10, and Au@SiO2@Au67Cu33, respectively. Here, the SiO2 shell is essential to prevent the interaction between the 120 nm Au core and analytical targets. Then, the Raman signal of surface intermediate species during hydrogenation of p-NTP to p-ATP on nanocatalysts can be amplied and detected due to the SERS enhancement properties of the 120 nm Au core. Moreover, we studied the changes in the Raman signal of intermediate species by varying the Cu content. As a result, the direct spectral evidence demonstrating that the reaction route of p-NTP to p-\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Thus, Au100 NPs, Au90Cu10 NPs, and Au67Cu33 NPs were successfully obtained. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization studies further showed that Au100 NPs, Au90Cu10 NPs, and Au67Cu33 NPs possessed almost identical shape and similar size (13 nm) (Fig. 1a and S1a\u2212c\u2020).8 X-ray diffraction (XRD) data of AuCu alloys with different compositions show the typical face-centered cubic crystal phase with a similar diffraction pattern between the standard Au and Cu peaks (Fig. 1b), which is consistent with the reported AuCu alloys in the literature.52 The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of Au67Cu33 and Au90Cu10 shows an interplanar distance of about 0.22 nm, which matches well with the d-spacing value of the metallic AuCu(111) plane (Fig. S2\u2020). Further study of the p-NTP hydrogenation process on Au100 NPs, Au90Cu10 NPs, and Au67Cu33 NPs using in situ SERS is limited due to their less-SERS enhancement properties owing to their small size (Fig. S3\u2020).45 In this regard, SERS-active Au NPs with a diameter of 120 nm were prepared as the SERS enhancer (Fig. S4a and b\u2020).45,46 Aer that, the Au@SiO2 structure was further prepared by coating 120 nm Au NPs with a thin layer of silica (\u223c2 nm), which can prevent the interaction between 120 nm Au NPs and analytical targets (Fig. 1c).40,41 Then, Au100 NPs, Au90Cu10 NPs, and Au67Cu33 NPs were deposited on Au@SiO2, forming Au@SiO2@Au100, Au@SiO2@Au90Cu10, and Au@SiO2@Au67Cu33 catalysts, respectively. The UV-vis extinction spectrum results showed that the peak of plasmon resonance was shied from 604 cm\u22121 to 625 cm\u22121 aer depositing nanocatalysts on Au@SiO2, indicating the successful decoration of Au@SiO2 with nanocatalysts (Fig. S5\u2020). Fig. 1d shows the TEM characterization and elemental mapping images of a single Au@SiO2@Au67Cu33 catalyst with a 120 nm Au core and many Au67Cu33 NPs as the satellites. Therefore, the Raman signal from surface species on Au100 NPs, Au90Cu10 NPs, or Au67Cu33 NPs can be amplied by using a SERS-active Au core and detected using in situ spectra. These results make sure that the hydrogenation process of p-NTP on Au@SiO2@Au100, Au@SiO2@Au90Cu10, or Au@SiO2@Au67Cu33 catalysts can be investigated by using in situ SERS (Fig. 1e).\nFirst, to track the hydrogenation process of p-NTP on singlecomponent Au100 NPs, in situ SERS was used to track the\nChem.

Before the reaction, the catalyst was immersed in the p-NTP aqueous solution overnight, ensuring the adsorption of the p-NTP molecule at the catalyst surfaces with saturation. Then, the reaction started once the catalyst adsorbing p-NTP came into contact with the NaBH4 aqueous solution. During the reaction process, p-NTP can be reduced by the active hydrogen species (H*), which are formed from the dissociation activation of NaBH4 on the catalyst surface.42 And in situ SERS spectra of the hydrogenation reaction of p-NTP on different catalysts were collected at a certain time interval. First, the hydrogenation process of p-NTP on Au@SiO2 was rst studied by in situ SERS and is shown in Fig. 2a. At 0 s, the Raman peaks at 1332 cm\u22121 and 1570 cm\u22121, assigned to the NO2-stretching and C\u2013Cstretching band in the benzene ring of substrate p-NTP,41 were observed obviously, indicating the successful adsorption of pNTP on Au@SiO2. However, these peaks did not show any change during the reaction process even on extending the reaction time to 1800 s. And we did not detect any new Raman\n3556 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 3554\u20133561\npeaks, indicating that Au@SiO2 is inert in catalyzing the hydrogenation of p-NTP. Thus, Au@SiO2 acted merely as a platform to enhance the Raman signal of surface species. However, for the Au@SiO2@Au100 catalyst, the intensity of Raman peaks associated with substrate p-NTP at 1332 cm\u22121 and 1570 cm\u22121, was decreased gradually as the reaction proceeded from 0 s to 1800 s as seen in the in situ SERS spectra (Fig. 2b). Meanwhile, a new peak centered at 1594 cm\u22121, which was assigned to the stretching coordinate of the benzene ring of product p-ATP,41,47 was detected and the intensity of this new peak was increased gradually with the reaction time. These results indicate that p-NTP can be hydrogenated to p-ATP on Au@Au100. Besides, in addition to the observation of the peaks associated with substrate p-NTP and product p-ATP, three new peaks located at 1142 cm\u22121, 1388 cm\u22121 and 1429 cm\u22121 were detected in the in situ SERS spectra recorded on Au@SiO2@Au100. These three peaks were assigned to the C\u2013N stretching and N]N stretching vibrational band of coupling intermediate product p,p\u2032-dimercaptoazobenzene (p,p\u2032-DMAB).41 Interestingly, the intensity of peaks assigned to p,p\u2032-DMAB was rst\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

The above results conrmed that p,p\u2032-DMAB was directly involved in the p-NTP hydrogenation process on Au100 NPs, indicating the presence of the coupling route synthesizing pATP from p-NTP. The control experiment showed that there was no reaction without NaBH4, indicating that NaBH4 acted as the reduction agent in the hydrogenation of p-NTP (Fig. S6\u2020).\nThen, the hydrogenation of p-NTP on Au@SiO2@Au90Cu10 (Fig. 2c) and Au@SiO2@Au67Cu33 (Fig. 2d) catalysts was further studied by in situ SERS with the same measurement conditions as the Au@SiO2@Au100 catalyst. In situ SERS spectra obtained on Au@SiO2@Au90Cu10 were similar to that on Au@SiO2@Au100 except for the observation of the lower intensity of peaks assigned to p,p\u2032-DMAB during the detection time of 1800 s (Fig. 2c). On further increasing the mole percentages of Cu from 10 of Au@SiO2@Au90Cu10 to 33 of Au@SiO2@Au67Cu33, the peaks assigned to p,p\u2032-DMAB were not detected in the in situ SERS spectra recorded on Au@SiO2@Au67Cu33. To compare the discrepancy of chemical behaviors on Au@SiO2@Au100, Au@SiO2@Au90Cu10, and Au@SiO2@Au67Cu33 during the hydrogenation reaction of p-NTP, the initial coverage of p-NTP (Fig. S7\u2020) and time-dependent intensity variation curve of the Raman peaks for p,p\u2032-DMAB (at \u223c1142 cm\u22121) on the three catalysts were plotted (Fig. 2e). Based on the time-dependent coverage variation curves of p-NTP on the three catalysts, we found that the coverage of p-NTP on the three different catalysts\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\ndecreased when the reaction started. And the coverage of p-NTP on Au@SiO2@Au67Cu33 showed a faster decrease rate, indicating that Cu doping can improve the hydrogenation of p-NTP. The time-dependent intensity variation curve of the Raman peaks for p,p\u2032-DMAB results showed that the peak intensity of p,p\u2032-DMAB decreased in the order of Au@SiO2@Au100 > Au@SiO2@Au90Cu10 > Au@SiO2@Au67Cu33, proposing that the Cu doping can inhibit the formation of coupling product p,p\u2032DMAB. And p,p\u2032-DMAB might not the reaction intermediate during the hydrogenation of p-NTP to p-ATP over Au@SiO2@Au67Cu33. A control experiment, tracking the hydrogenation of azobenzene (DMAB) on Au@SiO2@Au67Cu33 by in situ SERS, further conrmed this deduction. In the in situ SERS spectra, ve peaks located at 1183, 1146, 1440, 1470, and 1492 cm\u22121, were observed obviously, which are assigned to the C\u2013N and N]N stretching modes of DMAB (Fig. 2f). And there was no change for the peaks assigned to DMAB with reaction time,48 conrming that p,p\u2032-DMAB was not the reaction intermediate during the hydrogenation of p-NTP to p-ATP over Au@SiO2@Au67Cu33. These results presented the direct spectral evidence of route regulation from the coupling route on Au100 NPs to the direct route on Au67Cu33 NPs for hydrogenation of p-NTP to pATP at a molecular level. That said, the reaction route can be regulated to the direct route owing to a higher Cu concentration in Au67Cu33 NPs.\nThe regulation of the reaction route from the coupling route to the direct route by alloying Cu in Au may have a great relationship with the change in its electronic structure.49,50 Thus,\nChem.

With an increase in the Cu concentration, the binding energies of both Au 4f7/2 and Au 4f5/2 for Au67Cu33 NPs were further positively shied to 84.7 and 88.4 eV, indicating the decrease in the electron density of Au,52 whereas the electron density of Cu\n3558 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 3554\u20133561\nincreased with the increase in Cu concentration based on the Cu 2p XPS spectra of Au90Cu10 and Au67Cu33 NPs (Fig. 3b). This clearly indicated that electrons were transferred from Au to Cu when these elements form alloy NPs. And a higher Cu concentration in Au100\u2212xCux NPs leads to an increase in the transfer number of electrons from Au to Cu.\nTo further understand the critical role of Cu in route regulation from the coupling route on Au100 NPs to the direct route on Au67Cu33 NPs for hydrogenation of p-NTP to p-ATP, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed based on Au(111) and AuCu(111). To reduce the complexity of computation, we focused on the hydrogenation process of nitrobenzene (PhNO2) to phenylamine (PhNH2) during DFT calculations. First, the charge distribution of AuCu(111) was analyzed through the charge density difference (Fig. 4a). We found that the charge accumulation is shown as the blue region close to Cu atoms, and the charge depletion is shown as the red region close to Au atoms, meaning that electrons can transfer from Au to Cu. This result is in accordance with the results from XPS characterization studies. The absorption energy of H species, an important active species during hydrogenation of PhNO2, was also calculated on the surface of Au(111) and AuCu(111) here (Fig. 4b). The absorption energy of H species on Au(111) was calculated to be \u22120.79 eV. However, for AuCu(111), H species is favored to adsorb on the Cu atom with a stronger absorption energy of \u22121.29 eV. This result proved that it is easier for the active Cu\u2013H species with stronger absorption energy to be formed on AuCu(111). Additionally, the adsorption energies of PhNO2 on AuCu(111) and Au(111) were further calculated, respectively. The results showed that the adsorption energy of PhNO2 on the surface of AuCu(111) (\u22121.37 eV) was stronger than that of Au(111) (\u22121.05 eV) (Fig. S8\u2020). The stronger adsorption energy of PhNO2 on AuCu(111) can suppress the formation of coupling products, favoring the formation of PhNH2 with a direct route.8\nich blue and red regions indicate electron accumulation and depletion, nd their corresponding adsorption energies.

Aer being adsorbed on the Au(111) or AuCu(111) surface, *PhNO2 formed PhNOOH* by combining with H*, which then quickly dissociated to form PhNO* andOH*. PhNO* further combined with H* to generate PhNOH*. There are two reaction routes for the further transformation of PhNOH*. (i) PhNOH* can couple with PhNO*, forming PhON = NPh* and facilitating the formation of PhNH2* via the coupling route; (ii) PhNOH* can undergo hydrogenation to form phenylhydroxylamine (PhNHOH*), which favors the occurrence of a direct route to form PhNH2*. However, the Gibbs free energies of the same intermediates on Au(111) and the AuCu(111) surface are different, leading to the existence of different reaction routes between Au(111) and the AuCu(111) surface. For the Au(111) surface, the energy for PhNOH* hydrogenation to PhNHOH* is 0.61 eV, which is higher than that for the coupling reaction between PhNOH* and PhNO* (0.42 eV) (Fig. 4c). This result shows that PhNOH* favors to couple with PhNO*, leading to the appearance of a coupling route at Au(111). For AuCu(111), the formation energy of PhNHOH* (0.10 eV) ismuch lower than that of coupling intermediate PhON = NPh* (0.30 eV), indicating that AuCu(111) favors the direct route to form PhNH2* by facilitating the formation of PhNHOH* (Fig. 4d). This unambiguously conrms that AuCu(111) can effectively reduce the energy barrier of PhNOH* hydrogenation to PhNHOH*, resulting in the favoring of the occurrence of a direct route on the surface of AuCu(111). In addition, the binding geometries of the reaction intermediates on Au(111) or the AuCu(111) surface, are shown in Fig. S9.\u2020\nBased on the results obtained from in situ SERS experiments, XPS characterization studies, and theoretical calculations, the route regulation mechanism mediated by bimetallic Au67Cu33 NPs for the catalytic PhNO2 hydrogenation reaction was proposed. First, NaBH4 is activated on the catalyst surface, forming active hydrogen species. The Cu\u2013H species formed on Au67Cu33 NPs has stronger adsorption energy than Au\u2013H species on Au100 NPs. For Au100 NPs, PhNOH* favors to couple with PhNO*, forming PhON = NPh* and promoting the occurrence of the coupling route. However, the formed active Cu\u2013H species on Au67Cu33 NPs with stronger adsorption energy can promote the direct hydrogenation of PhNOH* to form PhNHOH*, favoring the appearance of a direct route."

By combining XPS and DFT calculations, we found that Cu doping can favor the formation of active Cu\u2013H species owing to the electron accumulation of Cu, which can promote the formation of PhNHOH* and lead to regulation in the pathway to the direct route on Au67Cu33 NPs. Our study provides direct spectral evidence demonstrating the critical role of Cu in the route regulation for hydrogenation reactions of nitroaromatics on bimetallic Au67Cu33 NPs at a molecular level and claries the route regulation mechanism. This result has signicant implications for multimetallic alloy nanocatalyst mediated reaction mechanisms and helps to guide the rational design of multimetallic alloy catalysts for catalytic hydrogenation reactions."
