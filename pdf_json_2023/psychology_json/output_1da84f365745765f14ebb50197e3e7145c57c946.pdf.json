    "abstractText": "NADP(H) is a centralmetabolic hubproviding reducing equivalents tomultiple biosynthetic, regulatory and antioxidative pathways in all living organisms. While biosensors are available to determineNADP or NADPH levels in vivo, no probe exists to estimate the NADP(H) redox status, a determinant of the cell energy availability. We describe herein the design and characterization of a genetically-encoded ratiometric biosensor, termed NERNST, able to interact with NADP(H) and estimate ENADP(H). NERNST consists of a redox-sensitive green fluorescent protein (roGFP2) fused to an NADPH-thioredoxin reductase C module which selectively monitors NADP(H) redox states via oxidoreduction of the roGFP2 moiety. NERNST is functional in bacterial, plant and animal cells, and organelles such as chloroplasts and mitochondria. Using NERNST, we monitor NADP(H) dynamics during bacterial growth, environmental stresses in plants, metabolic challenges to mammalian cells, and wounding in zebrafish. NERNST estimates the NADP(H) redox poise in living organisms, with various potential applications in biochemical, biotechnological and biomedical research.",

Calcaterra1, Mathias Beller5, Nestor Carrillo 1 & Matias D. Zurbriggen 2,6\nNADP(H) is a centralmetabolic hubproviding reducing equivalents tomultiple biosynthetic, regulatory and antioxidative pathways in all living organisms. While biosensors are available to determineNADP+ or NADPH levels in vivo, no probe exists to estimate the NADP(H) redox status, a determinant of the cell energy availability. We describe herein the design and characterization of a genetically-encoded ratiometric biosensor, termed NERNST, able to interact with NADP(H) and estimate ENADP(H). NERNST consists of a redox-sensitive green fluorescent protein (roGFP2) fused to an NADPH-thioredoxin reductase C module which selectively monitors NADP(H) redox states via oxidoreduction of the roGFP2 moiety. NERNST is functional in bacterial, plant and animal cells, and organelles such as chloroplasts and mitochondria. Using NERNST, we monitor NADP(H) dynamics during bacterial growth, environmental stresses in plants, metabolic challenges to mammalian cells, and wounding in zebrafish. NERNST estimates the NADP(H) redox poise in living organisms, with various potential applications in biochemical, biotechnological and biomedical research.\nNADPH provides the reducing power for most cellular biosynthetic reactions, contributes to antioxidative defense mechanisms and plays key roles in signaling pathways, integrating developmental and environmental stimuli in eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea1\u20136. Enzymes catalyzing NADP(H)-associated reactions are distributed in different cellular compartments. Therefore, spatiotemporally-resolved detection of NADP(H) levels and redox states in living cells and subcellular compartments (as defined by the NADPH/NADP+ ratio or the redox potential ENADP(H)) is crucial for understanding the role of this cofactor in central and secondary metabolism, regulation and defense, and to\nReceived: 10 February 2022\nAccepted: 12 May 2023\nCheck for updates\n1Institutode Biolog\u00edaMolecular y Celular deRosario (IBR-UNR/CONICET), Facultad deCiencias Bioqu\u00edmicas y Farmac\u00e9uticas, UniversidadNacional de Rosario (UNR), 2000 Rosario, Argentina. 2Institute of Synthetic Biology, University of D\u00fcsseldorf, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany. 3Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology I, Medical Faculty and University Hospital D\u00fcsseldorf, Heinrich-Heine-University D\u00fcsseldorf, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany. 4Faculty of Biology and Signalling Research Centres BIOSS and CIBSS, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany. 5Institute of Mathematical Modeling of Biological Systems, University of D\u00fcsseldorf, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany. 6CEPLAS \u2013Cluster of Excellence on Plant Sciences, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany. 7Present address: INM - Leibniz Institute for New Materials and Department of Materials Sciences and Engineering, Saarland University, Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany. e-mail: carrillo@ibr-conicet.gov.ar; matias.zurbriggen@uni-duesseldorf.de\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:3277 1\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\nmonitor the energy status of the cell. Conventional methods for NADP(H) determination usually involve tissue destruction, are prone to sample oxidation during processing, display limited specificity and do not discriminate between cellular compartments7\u201310. Thus, noninvasive quantitative molecular tools are much needed.\nGenetically-encoded fluorescent sensors could overcome these limitations by detecting defined targets in specific tissues, cells and subcellular compartments. SoNar biosensors have been designed for both NADH11,12 and NAD+ (ref. 13), and can in combination estimate NADH/NAD+ ratios in vivo14,15. They are based on binding of the dinucleotides to the redox-sensing repressor Rex, which regulates transcription of respiratory genes in bacteria in response to the intracellular NADH/NAD+ redox poise. This ligand-binding domainwas fused to two circularly-permuted yellow fluorescent proteins (cpYFP), thereby coupling the conformational changes caused by NAD(H) docking to changes in fluorescence11\u201315. SoNar has been further engineered to switch its nucleotide specificity, generating the iNap series of NADPH probes16. NADP+ levels, in turn, could be determined by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) using Apollo-NADP+, a biosensor based on NADP+-dependent homodimerization of glucose6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) fused to different fluorescent proteins17. However, no sensor is currently available to directly report on cellular NADP(H) redox status. Smith et al.18 have recently identified this limitation as amajor pending issue, and indicated that sensors able to determine NADPH:NADP+ ratios and NADP(H) redox potentials (ENADP(H)) are badly needed to properly estimate energy availability in living organisms.\nRatiometric probes areparticularly well suited for in vivo imaging. By using two excitation wavelengths they generate an internally normalized signal that is independent of biosensor expression levels18,19. Redox-sensitive ratiometric sensors based on green/red/yellow fluorescent proteins (for instance, roGFP2 and rxRFP1) have been prepared by introducing vicinal cysteines in GFP/cpRFP that can equilibrate with cellular thiols, most conspicuously glutathione (GSH)20\u201323, but also thioredoxin (Trx)24. Fusion with various redox partners allowed changes in specificity and fast equilibration rates25,26.\nWe target here the development of a biosensor suitable to determine the cellularNADP(H) redox status. For this, we combine two molecularmodules: a rice NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase C (NTRC) and roGFP2 as NADPH sensing and output components, respectively. We thus exploit the ability of NTRC to mediate disulfide reduction specifically by NADPH27 to generate a probe that can monitor the NADP(H) redox status through oxido-reduction of vicinal dithiols/disulfides in roGFP2, which can be determined by live imaging or fluorescence spectroscopy. NTRC is fused in-frame to the N-terminal end of roGFP2 to yield NERNST (NADP(H)-estimating ratiometric non-destructive sensing tool). We show that NERNST maintains the ratiometric properties of roGFP2, and productively interacts with NADP(H) in vitro and in vivo. The fluorescent biosensor can be easily customized for use in mid-throughput experimental setups for pharmacological and genetic studies and in combination with advanced confocal microscopy approaches.We illustrate the potential applicability of NERNST in fundamental research and biotechnological practice through various proof-of-concept experiments in bacterial, plant and animal cells, in subcellular compartments including chloroplasts and mitochondria, and in whole plants and zebrafish."

            "text": "Design and in vitro characterization of NERNST To generate a genetically-encoded molecular probe capable of transducing reducing equivalents between the universe of pyridine nucleotides to that of dithiols/disulfides, we fused rice NTRC, the NADP(H) sensor, to the N-terminus of roGFP2, the output module (Fig. 1a; Supplementary Tables 1-3). The two components were connected by spacers of 30 or 45 amino acids (aa) to probe different\ngeometries through a flexible interaction between the linked modules (Fig. 1a; Supplementary Table 2; see Methods). NTRC has a built-in Trx domain at the C-terminal end of a canonical NADPH-Trx reductase (NTR) domain28. Inactive NERNST versions were generated for control purposes by replacing active-site cysteines by serines in both the NTR and Trx domains using site-directed mutagenesis (Supplementary Fig. 1a).\nNTRC has been proposed to act as a homodimer with head-to-tail orientation, so that reducing equivalents are conveyed from the NTR domain of one subunit to the Trx domain of the other27. Accordingly, we propose the reaction mechanism depicted in Fig. 1a for NERNST, and predict that electron exchange between the sensor and the NADP(H) pool should lead to changes in the fluorescence of the roGFP2 moiety (Fig. 1a, see below). To characterize the optical properties and redox performance of NERNST, wild-type (Wt) and mutant versions of the biosensor were cloned in the plasmid pET-TEV under control of the T7 promoter (Supplementary Fig. 1a) and expressed in chaperone-rich Escherichia coli strains (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Histidine-tagged recombinant products were purified by affinity chromatography (Supplementary Fig. 1c\u2013e). Dimers were the most abundant form, although variable amounts of monomer were also recovered from Ni-resins as revealed by native PAGE (Supplementary Fig. 1f). Dimeric forms were separated from the monomers by sizeexclusion chromatography (Supplementary Fig. 1d, f), and used as purified protein samples for in vitro characterization.\nAbsorption spectra of purified NERNST displayed maxima at 387 nm and 488 nm (Supplementary Fig. 2). The overall shape of the spectrum suggests that the probe was largely oxidized during purification by reaction with oxygen and indeed, little or no spectral changes were observed upon addition of 10mM H2O2 (Fig. 1b; Supplementary Fig. 2). Chemical reduction with excess dithiothreitol (DTT), instead, led to virtual disappearance of the 387-nm peak and a moderate increase at the 488-nm region (Supplementary Fig. 2). Extinction coefficients (\u03b5) of 13.0mM\u22121 cm\u22121 and 21.8mM\u22121 cm\u22121 at 488 nm were determined for the oxidized and reduced forms, respectively, whereas the 387-nm peak of oxidized NERNST had \u03b5387 = 17.7mM\n\u22121 cm\u22121 (Supplementary Table 4). The fluorescence excitation spectrum of purified NERNST displayed features similar to the absorption spectrum, with excitation maxima at 390nm and 490 nm (Supplementary Fig. 3a), and a single emission peak around 510 nm (Supplementary Fig. 3b). As expected, DTT reduction obliterated most of the 390-nm excitation peak, accompanied by a fluorescence increase at the 490-nm region, with the anticipated impact on the emission spectra (Supplementary Fig. 3c, d; Fig. 1b). Quantum yields increased from 0.66 to 0.91 upon reduction, with a concomitant enhancement in NERNST brightness (Supplementary Table 4). Spectral characteristics were thus similar to those displayed by other roGFP-based biosensors21, indicating that the optical properties of the fluorescent protein were not significantly affected by fusion with NTRC.\nThe ratio R of the fluorescence emission intensities after excitation at the twomaxima (390nm and 490nm; R = I390/I490) reflects the oxidation state of the probe (OxDNERNST; see Methods), with R values increasing with OxDNERNST as exemplified in Fig. 1a. The actual excitation wavelengths used in the calculations will depend on the equipment configuration (see below). On the other hand, the difference in the R values of the fully oxidized and reduced forms of the probe (Rox\u2013Rred), obtained by chemical reaction with strong oxidants and reductants, defines the dynamic range (DR) of measurements for each system25,26.\nIncubation of NERNST dimers with 500\u03bcM NADPH led to rapid reduction of the probe, as shown by the decline in the R value (Fig. 1b). Dimer variants with flexible arms of 30 or 45 aa yielded essentially the same results (Supplementary Fig. 4). NERNST reduction was complete in about 3min (SupplementaryFig. 5a).Under the sameconditions, the\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:3277 2\nbiosensor was not significantly reduced byNADHor GSH (Fig. 1b). Cysto-Ser mutations in NTRC completely abolished the NADPH effect, indicating that the NTRC moiety mediates roGFP2 reduction (Fig. 1c). As with other roGFP2-based bioprobes19\u201321,24,25, the mutant NERNST versions can still react chemically with DTT or H2O2, rendering the totally reduced and oxidized forms of the roGFP2moiety, respectively (Fig. 1c). Reduction by NADPH was concentration-dependent, and virtually complete at 1mM under the conditions employed (Fig. 1d). Unlike the dimeric forms, monomeric NERNST did not react with NADPH (Supplementary Fig. 5b, c). This observation agrees with the catalytic mechanism proposed for NTRC27, and lends support to the model of Fig. 1a. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 5, NERNST could be fully reduced by a brief incubation with DTT. After DTT removal by gel filtration, the reduced biosensor was slowly oxidized by dissolved oxygen, but reacted several-fold fasterwithNADP+ (Supplementary Fig. 6a, b), even\nc\nWt Mut Wt Mut Wt Mut 0.00\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\n0.04\n0.05\n0.06\nR\nns \u2731\u2731\u2731\u2731 ns\nNADPH H2O2DTT\nb\nH2O2 Non treated\nDTT NADPH NADH GSH 0.00\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\n0.04\n0.05\nR\n\u2731\u2731\u2731\u2731 ns ns\ne f\n6.0 6.5 7.0 7.5 8.0 0.00\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\n0.04\n0.05\npH\nR\nH2O2DTT NADP(H) Non treated\nd\n0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 0.00\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\n0.04\nR\nNADPH (\u03bcM)\na\nADF\nFAD\nS143C\nS140C\nS380C\nS377C CS\nCS\nC143S\nC140S\nC380S\nC377S\nNADPH\nNADPH\nS\nSC\nC\nR = I390 I490\nR = 0.505\nR = 0.243\nSS\nNTRC\nSS\nroGFP2\nSS\nInput module Output module\nspacer 30 or 45 aa\nNADP(H) sensor\nNTR Trx\nS\nSC\nC\nSH\nSHC\nC\n390 nm 490 nm\nWavelength (nm) 065045005084 025\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\nIn te\nns ity\n(a .u .)

Successive additions of NADPH and NADP+ led to the expected changes in NERNST redox status (Supplementary Fig. 6c), confirming that the reaction was fully reversible. When oxidizedNERNSTwas incubatedwith differentNADPH/NADP+mixtures at two NADP(H) concentrations, the degree of sensor oxidation (OxDNERNST) increasedwith the fraction of NADP+ in themix, and a plot of OxDNERNST versus ENADP(H), calculated from the corresponding NADPH/NADP+ ratios using the Nernst equation (see Methods), resulted in a typical titration curve for both 0.5mM and 1mM NADP(H) (Fig. 1e). TheR values obtained at a 1:1 NADPH/NADP+ ratio did not vary significantly between pH 6.5 and 8.0, but showed a moderate increase below pH 6.5 (Fig. 1f). Fluorescence emissions of the purified, fully oxidized and fully reduced sensors were largely insensitive to pH changes in the range assayed (Fig. 1f).\nRates of NERNST oxidation increased with NADP+ concentration (Supplementary Fig. 6b\u2013d). Upon completion of the reaction, R values were similar to those of oxidized NERNST, although the initial R values were higher than the ones measured for the fully reduced biosensor (Supplementary Fig. 6d). Most likely, these differences resulted from slow oxidation of the probe by dissolved O2 during the manipulations that preceded fluorescent measurements. Unlike NADP+, reaction of NERNST with plant or bacterial thioredoxins was very slow, not appreciably different from spontaneous oxidation (Supplementary\nFig. 7), suggesting that thioredoxins are not significant redox partners for the biosensor.\nThe kinetics of NERNST reduction by NADPH was largely unaffected by the presence of other redox-active metabolites such as GSH, GSSG, NADH, NAD+ or cysteine (Supplementary Fig. 8). Many developmental and environmental stimuli trigger cellular responses involving changes in H2O2 concentrations, as a key signaling molecule in multiple physiological processes31\u201333. It was therefore interesting to determine if NERNST output could be affected by H2O2. While the reduced biosensor did react with H2O2 in the presence of NADPH, oxidation only became apparent at 6mMH2O2 (Supplementary Fig. 9). Cellular levels of this oxidant have been reported at the low nM range in bacteria34, plants35 and mammals36,37, suggesting that this interference should be negligible in vivo.\nIf the fluorescence intensities of the fully reduced and oxidized forms of the biosensor can be determined experimentally, the resulting data can be employed to calculate OxDNERNST25,26 (see Eq. (2) in Methods), and the NADP(H) redox potential ENADP(H) estimated from OxDNERNST using the Nernst equation:\nENADP H\u00f0 \u00de = E 00 NADP H\u00f0 \u00de RT nF ln NADPH\u00bd NADP+ = E00NERNST RT nF ln 1 OxDNERNST OxDNERNST = ENERNST\nLiving organisms are open systems, and cellular redox pools are normally not in equilibrium with each other38, although redox pairs might remain in steady-state if the overall physiological conditions are stable (Supplementary note). This does not preclude the use of redoxresponsive probes to estimate redox potentials, which can provide a measure of the oxido-reduction status at a defined condition, as it is extensively documented and discussed in the literature25,29,30,39\u201346 (see also the Supplementary note). Chloroplast EGSH, for instance, could be reported by roGFP2 evenbywhole-plant imaging45.We favor the useof ENADP(H) over R values whenever possible, because redox potentials capture important features of redox systems that cannot be accounted for by R values,most remarkably, the key effect of the pH on the redox drive, which becomes particularly relevant when comparing compartments with pH differences, or biological processes involving pH shifts.\nThe results thus indicate that NERNST can provide estimations of the redox state of the NADP(H) pool and be used, in principle, to\ndetermine ENADP(H) in living organisms. In the following, we illustrate the application of this probe to various biological systems. Both the 30-aa and 45-aa NERNST variants could be expressed in the cytosol of bacterial, plant and animal cells, but only the NERNST version with the shorter linker accumulated in chloroplasts and mitochondria (see below). Supplementary Table 2 shows the specific variant(s) used and reported in each system.\nEstimation of NADP(H) redox changes in bacterial cells The redox-sensing properties of NERNST were first investigated in E. coli cells expressing the biosensor under control of the T7 promoter (Supplementary Fig. 1a) by monitoring fluorescence changes through laser-scanning confocalmicroscopy.Weevaluated the capability of the sensor to estimate the NADP(H) redox poise in cells growing on different metabolic regimes. Typical results are shown in Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 10a. NERNST showed significant fluorescence in all conditions, suggesting that assembly of the fused protein was not impaired by nutrient availability. Incubation of the cells with DTT or H2O2 led to the expected fluorescence changes (Supplementary\nFig. 10a,b), allowing determination of OxDNERNST and eventually ENADP(H) (Fig. 2b). Within this context, changes in biosensor fluorescence are considered to provide reliable calculations of redox potential between 5 and95%probeoxidation30, whichwouldcorrespond to a window of 80mV around an assumed E00NERNST of \u2212280 mV at pH 7. A pH correction needs to be applied toOxDNERNST values, corresponding to \u22126 mV for each 0.1 unit above pH 730. This would represent a useful range between \u2212270 mV and -350 mV for E. coli, assuming a cytosolic pH of 7.547.\nWhen E. coli cells are cultured aerobically in rich media such as the Luria-Bertani (LB) broth, the availability of nutrients supports rapid growth via glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle48. These pathways provide the bulk of NADPH (Supplementary Fig. 11), whose levels are reported to increase during the first hours of growth to progressively decline as cells enter the stationary phase48. Accordingly, a redox potential ENADP(H) of -308 mV was estimated with NERNST at the exponential phase (Fig. 2a, b). Oxidation of the NADP(H) pool became evident as bacteria entered the stationary phase (Fig. 2a), with ENADP(H) increasing to \u2212286 mV (Fig. 2b).\nGrowth of E. coli inminimalmedia allows studies on themetabolic effects of different carbon sources. Cultures in acetate display a number of characteristic features, such as the induction of the glyoxylate pathway and of the NADP+-dependent malic enzyme encoded by the maeB gene, which accounts for most NADPH production49 (Supplementary Fig. 12). Fluorescence measurements of cells expressing NERNST yielded an ENADP(H) of -335 mV at the exponential phase of growth (Fig. 2a, b), indicating that the NADP(H) pool was indeed more reduced under these culture conditions than in LB medium.\nGlycerol enters central metabolism as glyceraldehyde-3phosphate50, delivering carbon backbones to the PPP, MaeB and the TCA cycle, which is the major NADPH source under these growth conditions (Supplementary Fig. 13). When bacteria were grown in glycerol as the sole carbon source, the redoxpotential calculated using NERNST was slightly less negative (ENADP(H) = \u2212324 mV) than that obtained in acetate (Fig. 2a, b).\nDuring aerobic growth with glucose, most NADPH is generated through the PPP and the TCA cycle (Supplementary Fig. 14), although both pathways proceed at lower rates compared to those expected during growth fromother carbon sources48. Accordingly, the NADP(H) redox potential of glucose-fed cells estimated using NERNST was ENADP(H) = \u2212295 mV (Fig. 2a, b). DR values between 0.9 and 1.4 were obtained for all conditions except for cells grown in glucose, which showed a rather small dynamic range (Supplementary Fig. 10b). Aerobic culture in glucose minimal medium led to lower NERNST expression levels compared to other growth media, presumably\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:3277 4\nreflecting the extensively documented impairment of lacZ induction by glucose (reviewed by Studier51). As a general feature, dynamic ranges varied widely in different biological systems (see below). The mechanistic origin of these variations is unknown, but is a common feature of roGFP2-based biosensors22,29,52,53. Variable autofluorescence (especially at the lower-wavelength excitation maximum), the experimental setup, and the sensitivity of the fluorescent device can affect DR absolute values, and this should be considered by the user. Reliable quantitativemeasurements require a high signal-to-noise ratio, andwe verified that this was the case in all our proof-of-concept assays. We also searched the images for spectroscopic artifacts, avoiding samples with \u201cpatches\u201d that appeared to differ strongly in fluorescent readout between different areas of the same cell or organelle, thus contradicting general biophysical concepts ondiffusion.We confirmed inour measurements that NERNST was uniformly distributed in the cytosol, stroma, matrix, etc., as reflected by homogeneous fluorescent readouts within a continuous space confined by a membrane. Also, the ratiometric nature of the sensor is expected to mitigate these inconveniences, except when the DR is too small to allow meaningful determinations.\nTaken together, the results show that NERNST canmonitor redox changes of the E. coli NADP(H) pool under various nutritional conditions. They also agree with the progressive increase of cellular NADPH levels from glucose to glycerol to acetate, as determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry on exponentially growing E. coli cells54. To evaluate how precisely the biosensor estimates ENADP(H) values, we determined the intracellular NADP+ andNADPH levels using the enzymatic cycling method55. This comparison is useful as a validation in this system because all NADP(H) is confined to a single cellular compartment. Redox potentials obtained using NERNST or the destructive assay showed a good correlation, with no statistically relevant differences (Fig. 2b).\nNERNST fluorescence output most likely reflects the redox status of the free NADP(H) pool, while the extractive method estimates total NADP(H). A large fraction of this pool has been reported to be bound to cellular proteins inmammalian cells56, although little is knownabout the situation in bacteria. Then, thematch between the two approaches might reflect a significantly higher fraction of free NADP(H) in E. coli compared tomammals, or a similar redox status in the free and bound pools. Further research will be necessary to elucidate this question.\nDetermination of NADP(H) redox changes in the cytosol and chloroplasts of leaf cells Monitoring NADPH levels in leaves is of the utmost importance because it provides the reducing power for the assimilation of CO2, which ultimately represents the main source of reduced carbon that shapes life on Earth as we know it. Most NADPH is produced in chloroplasts by the light reactions of photosynthesis, and consumed there in key biosynthetic reactions or exported to the cytosol to engage in other metabolic, protective or signaling pathways57, underscoring the importance of estimating NADP(H) levels in different cellular compartments, especially plastids. In order to provide NERNST access to specific organelles, we utilized a transit peptide (TP) as N-terminal extension added to the biosensor to permit chloroplast import and NADP(H) detection in the stroma. Constructs encoding plastid- and cytosol-targetedNERNSTwereplacedunder control of the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter (P35S; Fig. 3a) and introduced in Arabidopsis and tobacco plants via Agrobacteriummediated stable transformation58,59. WhileNERNST variants containing both the 30-aa and 45-aa linkers were readily expressed in the cytosol, only the 30-aa version could be imported by chloroplasts, and thus used in further experiments (Supplementary Table 2). Typical images of leaf cells from transgenic lines of the two species grown under chamber conditions are shown in Supplementary Fig. 15a\u2013e.

Cytosolic expression was visualized in both epidermal (Supplementary\nFig. 15b, d) and mesophyll cells (Supplementary Fig. 15e). Transgenic plants displayed no obvious phenotypic alterations in development and reproduction due to expression of the biosensor (Supplementary\nFig. 15f), allowing selection of homozygous lines.\nFluorescence imaging revealed uniform biosensor responses to H2O2 and DTT in both plastids and cytosol and in the expected directions (Supplementary Fig. 15a\u2013d). Dynamic ranges were determined for both species (Supplementary Fig. 15g), and Rox/Rred values used to calculate the degree of oxidation of the reporter in each compartment, and from it the magnitude of ENADP(H), assuming pH values of 7.3 and 8.0 for the leaf cytosol and stroma, respectively, under light conditions60. This sets a lower threshold for ENADP(H) detection of \u2212338 mV in the cytosol and \u2212380 mV in chloroplasts. As expected, the NADP(H) pool was significantly more reduced in chloroplasts than in the cytosol for both species (Fig. 3a).\nSince NADPH is produced and consumed during photosynthesis, the response of the biosensor was studied in dark-adapted and illuminated tobacco leaves. Stromal ENADP(H) decreased from \u2212308 mV in the dark to \u2212352 mV in the light (Fig. 3b), assuming a pH shift of 7.2 to 8.0 upon illumination61,62. Average light ENADP(H) values estimated an NADPH/NADP+ ratio of ~1.5,which agreeswellwith previous reports for barley chloroplasts63. Determination of ENADP(H) for the cytosolic NADP(H) pool indicates that it was similar to that of dark-adapted chloroplasts, and slightly more positive (oxidized) in the light than in the dark (Fig. 3b). Using iNapbioprobes specific for NADPH, Lim et al.57 showed that the reduced form of the dinucleotide increased in the stroma but decreased in the cytosol during dark-light transitions of Arabidopsis seedlings, in line with the observations reported here. Similar results have been obtained in rapid fractionation experiments64, but not assigned any particular relevance in physiological terms.\nNADP+ and NADPH contents were also determined by extractive methods in whole extracts from illuminated and dark-adapted leaves. Results obtained with both tobacco and Arabidopsis showed a trend similar to those reported by NERNST in chloroplasts, namely, a redox shift toward reduction of the NADP(H) pool upon dark-light transition (Supplementary Fig. 16). It is not possible to advance in comparison with NERNST-derived data because the NADPH/NADP+ ratios obtained by this procedure reflect the contributions of all cellular compartments (including mitochondria, peroxisomes, etc.). They cannot thus be used to calculate redox potentials, nor can they be quantitatively compared to the ratios or potentials estimated in specific locations such as chloroplasts or cytosol. This analysis illustrates the shortcomings of destructive methods compared to genetically-encoded biosensors in monitoring the space- and time-resolved dynamics of redox couples in vivo.\nStress situations known to trigger oxidative stress, such as drought, led to a significant increase in ENADP(H), especially in chloroplasts (Fig. 3c). TheR values, per se, provide a comparative estimation of the NADP(H) redox status in those cases in which Rox and Rred cannotbe determined53, due to poor access of oxidants and reductants and/or excess damage to the tissue. Moreover, if the change to be analyzed does not involve a pH shift, the R readouts directly reflect the differences in redox state between the initial and final conditions. This possibility is illustrated for NERNST-expressing leaves exposed to salt (Fig. 3d) and biotic stress (Fig. 3e). As in the case of drought, the redox shift caused by salinity predominantly affected the chloroplast NADP(H) pool (Fig. 3d). Biotic stress, in turn, was assayed by inoculating leaves with the necrotrophic bacterium Pectobacterium carotovorum, which elicits an oxidative burst that uses NADPH as electron donor65. Accordingly, NERNST indicated significant NADPH oxidation in the proximity of the infection site (Fig. 3e). Data points are\ndistributed in two apparent populations at the 1-mm sampling site (Fig. 3e), likely reflecting the cellular heterogeneity in terms of both fluorescence output and biotic damage, which is particularly critical in this region close to the infection source. Oxidation of the chloroplast NADP(H) pool declined at longer distances, whereas the cytosolic redox status remained unchanged (Fig. 3e).\nConstitutive expression driven by the P35S promoter allowed visualization of the probe in various tissues including roots. Spaceresolved imagingof theNADP(H) redox state along an axis longitudinal to the tobacco root length revealed that the pyridine nucleotide pool became more oxidized when approaching the root tip (Fig. 3f). This observation concurs with previous reports showing that both the root cap and the columella have increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and redox potential66.\nThe NERNST-encoding construct was also amenable to transient expression methods such as those developed for Nicotiana benthamiana leaves, displaying high levels of fluorescence in both chloroplasts and cytosol (Fig. 3g), and providing a rapid tool to estimate ENADP(H) in different cellular compartments without the time investment needed for stable transformation.\nNERNST probes the NADP(H) redox status in isolated leaf protoplasts Plant protoplasts display features that make them attractive as an experimental model system: they retain important properties of the original cells, can be easily isolated from mutant or transgenic plants, and can be transformed in vitro leading to transient expression of genes of interest. Moreover, the removal of the cell wall makes them accessible to pharmacological approaches which are impaired in whole tissues, and opens their adaptation to mid-throughput experimental set-ups67,68. Accordingly, they represent valuable tools to investigate biochemical and physiological processes in a fast and reliable way, and it was therefore of considerable interest to evaluate the behavior of NERNST in this system.\nProtoplasts isolated from leaves of Arabidopsis and tobacco plants stably transformed with the biosensor displayed typical signals in both chloroplasts and cytosol (Fig. 4a). Exposure to H2O2 or DTT elicited fluorescence changes in the expected directions for the two species (Supplementary Fig. 17a\u2013d). Estimations of ENADP(H) for the chloroplast stroma and cytosol yielded results comparable to those obtained in whole leaves (Fig. 4b).\nTransient expression of NERNST in Wt Arabidopsis protoplasts using the vectors employed for stable transformation yielded essentially the same type of fluorescent images, as exemplified for the cytosolic reporter (Supplementary Fig. 17e). ENADP(H) values (Fig. 4c) and dynamic ranges (Fig. 4d) showed good correlations between stably and transiently transformed protoplasts, suggesting that the manipulations involved in protoplast transformation did not cause major shifts in the NADP(H) redox balance. The results indicate that NERNST can be employed to estimate ENADP(H) in experiments using the protoplast model system.\nMonitoring NADP(H) dynamics in cultured human cells and mitochondria To monitor NADP(H) in animal systems, we first expressed NERNST in the cytosol of cultured human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293T andHeLa cells by transfection with vectors expressing the biosensor under control of the constitutive SV40 promoter (Fig. 5a). Uniform and intense fluorescence was detected in cells of the two lines (Fig. 5b, c; Supplementary Fig. 18a\u2013c). Images were analyzed after various treatments. Addition of a bolus of H2O2 or DTT caused fluorescence changes in the expected directions (Fig. 5b; Supplementary Fig. 18a). Use of the thiol oxidizing agent diamide16 yielded similar results (Supplementary Fig. 18a, b). Fluorescence changes driven by exposure to H2O2 displayed a biphasic response, with a fast increase in R upon\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:3277 7\naddition of the oxidant, followed by a second, slower rise after a lag period of several minutes (Fig. 5b). Subsequent addition of DTT led to rapid reduction (Fig. 5b). HEK-293T cells behaved in a similar way (Supplementary Fig. 18c). Comparison of initial R values in untreated cellswith Rox and Rred indicates that NERNSTwas largely reduced prior to the addition of the oxidant (Fig. 5b; Supplementary Fig. 18c).\nWe then used the sensor to report the variations in intracellular NADP(H) redox status caused by two different types of perturbations: genetic and pharmacological. First, the NADP(H) redox poise of HeLa cells was altered by expressing the p40phox subunit of humanNADPH oxidase, which promotes O2 reduction at the expense of NADPH consumption69. The oxidase subunit was fused to the fluorescent marker mCherry70 (Fig. 5a) for cellular visualization of the transgenic product (NOX), and indeed, strong red fluorescence could be detected in the co-transfected cells (Fig. 5c). Image analysis of the NERNST reporter showed that the NADP(H) pool became more oxidized upon NOX expression (Fig. 5d). Addition of the NOX inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) to the cell suspension prevented NADPH oxidation in NOX-expressing cells (Fig. 5d), indicating that the effect was dependent on the activity of the oxidase. Finally, NOX had no effect on the R values displayed by HeLa cells expressing roGFP2 or the inactive Cys-to-Ser mutant of NERNST (Supplementary Fig. 19).\nG6PDH is the main source of cytosolic NADPH in resting HeLa cells16. Incubationof the cellswith theG6PDH inhibitorG6PDi-1 (ref. 71) in high-glucose medium is expected to impair NADP+ reduction, with concomitant oxidation of the NADP(H) pool. We monitored the NERNST fluorescence changes using the Operetta64 high-content confocal imaging system which allows mid-throughput parallel and fast analysis of set-ups inmulti-well format. AdditionofG6PDi-1 led to a significant increase in the cytosolic R values of NERNST in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5e). The time-course of NADP(H) oxidation shows a lag phase with little or no change in R values, presumably reflecting the time required to progressively deplete the NADPH pool by consuming pathways, under conditions of limited replenishment through NADPH-producing enzymes other than G6PDH.\nIn animals, the impact of mitochondrial oxido-reductive metabolism on physiology, disease and aging is well recognized72. Given its importance, we targeted NERNST to HeLa mitochondria to monitor the NADP(H) redox state, by fusing the mitochondrial targeting sequence of subunit 8 from the human cytochrome c oxidase\ncomplex to the N-terminus of the biosensor (Fig. 5a). As in chloroplasts, the biosensor carrying the 45-aa linker did not accumulate in mitochondria. In this case, however, significant fluorescence was observed in the cytosol (Supplementary Fig. 20), suggesting that this NERNST precursor could not be imported by the organelle. Instead, NERNST fluorescence was readily detected in the mitochondria of cells transfected with the biosensor carrying the 30-aa linker (Fig. 5f, left). The mitochondrial NADP(H) pool oxidized spontaneously (i.e., in the absence of G6PDi-1) after prolonged incubation in the LCIS solution used for imaging (see Methods). Oxidation was not caused by the dimethyl sulfoxide used as solvent for G6PDi-1 (Supplementary Fig. 21) and most likely relates to the nutrient paucity of the imaging medium, which might boost mitochondrial oxidative metabolism after prolonged incubation. Exposure to G6PDi-1 led to further oxidation of the mitochondrial NADP(H) pool, again showing a two-phase kinetics (Fig. 5f). It is not clear if this effect results from direct or secondary causes. Several pathways have been implicated in the shuttling of reducing equivalents between the cytosol and mitochondria7,56, and might explain the observed correlation in the responses of the two compartmentalized pools. It is also possible, however, that G6PDi-1 could inhibit the mitochondrial isoform of G6PDH, which is regarded as the main source of NADPH in the organelle73,74.\nThe collected results indicate that NERNST could be expressed and folded in a functional conformation in the cytosol and mitochondria of cultured mammalian cells, providing a reliable tool to monitor NADP(H) dynamics in different cellular compartments of the host cell. In combination withmid-throughputmicroscopy, the sensor can therefore be implemented as a versatile platform for pharmacological and genetic studies of metabolism and physiology dynamics in animal cells, with important applications in the biomedical field since perturbations of NADP(H) homeostasis have been associated with several pathological conditions2\u20134,75.\nDetection of NADP(H) changes upon injury responses in zebrafish larvae Wounding of zebrafish larvae leads to a localized oxidative burst and a concurrent decline of NADPH levels16. We therefore probed whether NERNST can detect these changes in NADP(H) redox dynamics in vivo.

Sensor fluorescence increased and spread up to 15min, then declined in intensity and began to recede (Fig. 6c).\nNERNST R values also increased after fin wounding, indicating oxidation of the NADP(H) pool (Fig. 6c). The time course was similar to that of HyPerRed except that NADPH oxidation proceeded unabated during the 31-min timeframe of the assay (Fig. 6d). Using the NADPH biosensor iNap, Tao et al.16 reported a decline in NADPH levels upon wounding which is consistent with the decrease in the NADPH/NADP+ ratio observed here, indicating that NERNST can be employed to measure the NADP(H) redox status in living zebrafish embryos."

            "text": "We describe herein the design and characterization of NERNST, a ratiometric biosensor for monitoring NADP(H) redox state in living cells, based on the fusion of NADP(H)-dependent NTRC27 to redoxsensitive roGFP221. Purified NERNST was able to reversibly react with NADPHandNADP+, andwashighly specific for theNADP(H) pair (Fig. 1;\nSupplementary Figs. 7\u20139). Under the conditions employed, full reduction and oxidation was completed in a few minutes (Supplementary Figs. 5\u20139), providing a measure of the time responsiveness of theprobe. TheNADP(H) reporter could be expressed inmanydifferent cell types and targeted to chloroplasts and mitochondria, allowing detection of changes in NADP(H) redox poise in bacteria (Fig. 2), leaf and root cells in whole plants and mesophyll protoplasts (Figs. 3, 4), mammalian cultured cells (Fig. 5) and live fish embryos (Fig. 6).\nNERNST shares many favorable properties with former roGFPbased reporters25,26,29,77, including intense fluorescence emission, ratiometric behavior and activity in heterologous biological systems. NERNST is largely insensitive to pH variations within physiological margins (Fig. 1f). Changes in fluorescence intensities can be followed by confocal microscopy and microplate reading, as done here, and potentially also by flow cytometry. When expressed in living organisms, sensors based on roGFP may interact, in principle, with multiple redox partners, although kinetic limitations are expected to exist for most of them as the electron transfer is normally dominated by the\nc R (NERNST)\n500\n0\n125\n250\n375\n9\n1\n3\n5\n7\nBrightfield FI (HyPerRed)\n0 min\n10 min\n16 min\n22 min\n27 min\n31 min\nb 543 nm488 nm\nd\n0 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n0\n140\n280\n420\n560\n700\nTime (min)\nR (NERNST) FI (HyPerRed)\nR\nFI\na\nCap\npAK001 NERNST HyPerRedpAK002 DNA\nmRNA poly(A)NERNST\nHyPerRed poly(A)\nTranscription\nCo-injection\n48 h Tail-fin cut\nSP6\nSP6\nSV40\nSV40\nFig. 6 | Simultaneous imagingofNADP(H)andperoxidedynamics inawounded region of zebrafish tail fin. a Experimental set-up to evaluate NADP(H) redox status and ROS levels in zebrafish embryos after wounding.

In the case of NERNST, the NADP(H)-specific NTRC module and roGFP2 are forced into close proximity in the fusion construct, favoring the kinetics of redox exchange between them over other possible competitive reactions, thus allowing the use of NERNST as a tool to monitor NADP(H) redox status in living organisms, within the timeframe and pH range reported. Indeed, proof-of-concept experiments designed to modify the NADP(H) status by genetic interventions, environmental challenges and different nutritional sources indicated that the biosensor effectively reflects the expected changes in the redox state of the NADP(H) pool (Figs. 2\u20136).\nNERNST does not measure absolute NADP(H) concentrations, estimating instead its oxido-reductive status, a most relevant physiological parameter to investigate metabolic dynamics and predict cellular responses to environmental, developmental and genetic inputs. Indeed, the NADP(H) redox status is a key player in physiology, development and defense of all living organisms, with profound implications for biology and medicine. So far, estimations of this allimportant parameter have relied on the use of destructive methods which cannot discriminate between cellular compartments anddisplay significant reproducibility shortcomings. Genetically-encoded bioprobes have been designed to detect absolute levels of either NADP+ or NADPH but not their ratio, precluding estimation of the NADP(H) redox poise. NERNST overcomes this limitation and allowsmonitoring in vivoNADP(H) dynamics in a direct and reliable way, thus providing a useful tool to investigate the role of this central metabolite in growth, disease and responses to environmental stimuli. Moreover, it can be combined, in principle, with sensors based on a binding mechanism such as Apollo-NADP+ and iNap16,17, which can be spectrally tuned for multi-parametric imaging78.\nThe genetically-encoded biosensor proved to be versatile, as exemplified by its functionality in a series of evolutionary distant organisms (bacteria, plants and animals), different subcellular localizations (cytosol, mitochondria, chloroplasts) and in combination with nutritional,metabolic, pharmacological andgeneticperturbations. It is readily customizable for use both in simple set-ups available in standard biochemistry/molecular biology labs and in mid-throughput experimental approaches employing advanced confocal microscopy set-ups. Generalized application of NERNST in biochemical, biotech and medical research will open up novel perspectives to study the contribution of NADP(H) in such fundamental biological processes as embryogenesis, aging, inflammation and cell death, tissue regeneration and disease responses."

Animals were handled in compliance with relevant international guidelines (Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and American Veterinary Medical Association, https://zfin.org/). The CICUAL (Comit\u00e9 Institucional para el Cuidado y Uso de Animales de Laboratorio; Institutional Committee for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals) from the University of Rosario, Argentina (Facultad de Ciencias Bioqu\u00edmicas y Farmac\u00e9uticas \u2013 Universidad Nacional de Rosario\u2014UNR), approved and monitored the research protocol involving zebrafish (Res. N\u00b0 207/ 2018). To obtain embryos, male and female specimens were mated in a 3:4 ratio. The study did not involve wild animals or samples collected from the field.\nDesign of the NADP(H) ratiometric sensor (NERNST) and plasmids construction DNA fragments coding for rice NADPH-thioredoxin reductase C (NTRC)28 and roGFP221 were amplified from previously described expression vectors28,52 (see Supplementary Table 1) with primers\noHB272/oHB273 for NTRC and oHB274/oHB275 for roGFP2 (Supplementary Table 3). The NERNST biosensor was generated by fusing the DNA sequence coding for roGFP2 downstream of NTRC. In-frame sequences encoding 30- or 45-amino acid (aa) linkers containing Gly, Ser and Ala in various arrangements (Supplementary Table 2) were introduced between NTRC and roGFP2 via Fusion-PCR to probe different geometries for electron exchange. Constructs were cloned into plasmid pWW301 digestedwith NdeI/HindIII using Gibson Cloning79 to generate pHB124 and pHB125 expression plasmids (Supplementary\nTable 1). Linker-encoding sequences were synthesized by gBlocks (Integrated DNA Technologies, Leuven, Belgium). Mutant versions of the biosensor (in pHB129 and pHB130) were prepared by simultaneously replacing functional cysteines by serines at positions C140, C143, C377 and C380 of NTRC (Supplementary Table 1), using PCR amplification and Gibson assembly with primers oHB181/oHB182 and oHB183/oHB184 (Supplementary Table 3).\nExpression and purification of recombinant proteins NERNST DNA sequences were obtained from the corresponding pHB plasmids by digestion with NdeI and HindIII, and cloned in pET-TEV under the control of the T7 promoter to yield pPM002, pPM003, pPM004 and pPM005 (Supplementary Table 1). These plasmids were used to transform Escherichia coliBL21(DE3). To improve foldingof the expressed proteins and recovery in the soluble fraction, cells were cotransformed with plasmids expressing various molecular chaperones under the control of the araB promoter (Supplementary Table 1, Takara Bio Inc, Kusatsu, Japan). Bacteria were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth supplemented with 40 \u00b5g/ml kanamycin and 25 \u00b5g/ml chloramphenicol at 37 \u00b0C for 5 h and induced overnight at 20 \u00b0C by the addition of 50\u03bcM IPTG and 0.5mg/ml L-arabinose. Cells cotransformed with plasmid pGRO7 expressing GroEL and GroES yielded the highest NERNST levels andwere used thereafter. Bacteria were lysed by sonication, and cleared lysates prepared by centrifugation. Recombinant proteins were bound to a Ni-NTA column (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) through the His-tag, eluted with 0.5M imidazole and then dialyzed against 100mMK3PO4 pH7.3, 1mMEDTA, 150mMNaCl. Eluates were analyzed by SDS- and native PAGE; the latter showed two major fluorescent bands corresponding to dimeric and monomeric forms. The dimer was purified by molecular exclusion chromatography (UNICORN Control System 1 software) on a Superdex-200 Increase 10/300GL column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Chicago, IL) developed in 100mM K3PO4 pH 7.3, 1mM EDTA, 150mM NaCl, and used for in vitro experiments."

Relative quantum yields were determined as described by W\u00fcrth et al.80, using fluorescein (Sigma Aldrich St. Louis, MO) as standard. In brief, the absorption spectra of oxidized or reducedNERNST in 100mMK3PO4 pH 7 and fluorescein in 0.1 N NaOH were recorded to identify a common isosbestic point of 471 nm. Concentrations of samples and standard were adjusted to yield the same absorbance at the isosbestic wavelength, which was used for excitation. Emission spectra were measured in a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer (Cary Eclipse software) with identical instrument settings for probes and standard, after excitation at 471 nm. Since the refractive index of the solutions and the absorbance at the excitationwavelengths were the same for samples and standard, the relative quantum yields of the samples (\u03a6f,s) were determined using the following equation80:\n\u03a6f,s =\u03a6f,st Fs Fst\n\u00f01\u00de\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:3277 11\nwhere\u03a6f,st is the quantum yield of the fluorescein standard (st) under these conditions (0.89)80, and Fs and Fst are the fluorescence emission of sample and standard, respectively.\nTo assay the redox properties of purified NERNST, dimers were incubated with 10mM H2O2, 10mM DTT or 0.5mM of either NADPH, NADH or GSH in 100mM K3PO4 pH 7. Fluorescence emission intensities of NERNST (I) weremeasured at 528/20 nm in a fluorimetric plate reader (Synergy 2 Biotek, Himex, Turku, Finland; Gen5 software) after excitation at 360/40 nm or 485/20 nm to determine the R parameter (R = I390/I490), using 90-\u00b5l solutions of the recombinant protein. The wavelengths correspond to those provided by the equipment, and their exact values will vary depending on the availability of filters in each fluorescence detection system, as indicated below. The pH response of the biosensor was assayed between 5.8\u20138.0 in a buffer containing 0.2M NaH2PO4 and 0.2M Na2HPO4.\nFor the determination of midpoint redox potentials, the recombinant dimer was mixed with different NADPH/NADP+ ratios at final concentrations of 0.5mM or 1mM total NADP(H). Fully oxidized and reduced samples were prepared by reaction with 10mM H2O2 and 10mM DTT under the same conditions. After 7min of incubation at 25 \u00b0C, I390 and I490 were recorded and employed to calculate the degree of oxidation of the biosensor (OxDNERNST) using (Eq. 2) (ref. 25,26,52.). The OxDNERNST values measured under each condition allowed determination of ENERNST by the Nernst equation (Eq. 3), and ENADP(H), assuming that the two potentials are equal at detection (Eq. 4).\nOxDNERNST = R Rred\nI490min I490max \u00f0Rox R\u00de+ \u00f0R Rred\u00de \u00f02\u00de\nENERNST = E 00 NERNST RT nF ln 1 OxDNERNST OxDNERNST \u00f03\u00de\nENADP H\u00f0 \u00de = E 00 NADP H\u00f0 \u00de RT nF ln NADPH\u00bd NADP+ = E00NERNST RT nF ln 1 OxDNERNST OxDNERNST = ENERNST\n\u00f04\u00de\nThe term R in Eq.

I490min and I490max refer to the fluorescence intensities measured with excitation at 490nm for fully oxidized and fully reduced NERNST. In Eqs.

Standard redox potentials (E\u00b0\u2019) used were \u2212320 mV for NADP(H) and \u2212280 mV for NERNST22,25 at pH 7.\nKinetic measurements were carried out in a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer after excitation at 390nm and 490nm. Emission was recorded at 510 nm. Dimeric NERNST responses to 0.5mM NADPH alone or in the presence of 0.5mM of either cysteine, GSH, GSSG, NADH or NAD+ were assayed in 100mM K3PO4 pH 7. Dimeric NERNST oxidation by H2O2 in the presence of NADPH was measured in the same reaction medium. The biosensor was initially reduced by 0.5mM NADPH and then exposed to successive additions of H2O2 (0.015\u201329mM). Monomeric NERNST was tested in the same medium with 0.5mM NADPH or 10mM DTT.\nFor oxidation experiments with NADP+, dimeric NERNST was initially reduced by 10mM DTT for 6min on ice, and the fully reduced protein was desalted withMicro Bio-Sin\u00ae 6 Chromatography Columns (BioRad). Oxidation was carried out with 0.5-1mM NADP+, 10 \u00b5M thioredoxin-A from Escherichia coli or 10 \u00b5M thioredoxin-h\nfrom peach, and the kinetics was followed in a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer after excitation at 390 and 490 nm. To test the oxidation of the biosensor by NADP+ in the presence of NADPH, dimeric NERNST was incubated with 0.25mM glucose-6phosphate (G6P), 1 unit of glucose\u22126-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and the indicated concentrations of NADP+. Fluorescence was recorded at 6min in the Synergy plate reader with the corresponding setup.\nGrowth of E. coli in rich and minimal media E. coli BL21 DE3 cells expressing NERNST were cultured in LB broth or M9minimalmedium81, in the latter case supplementedwith 0.2% (w/v) casaminoacids and either 0.5% (w/v) glucose, 1% (v/v) glycerol or 1.2% (w/v) acetate as carbon sources. Antibiotics (40\u03bcg/ml kanamycin and 25\u03bcg/ml chloramphenicol) were added to all media. Induction with IPTG and L-arabinose was carried out as described before, except that the temperature was set at 28 \u00b0C instead of 20 \u00b0C after the addition of the inducer for bacteria grown inminimal media. Cells were harvested by centrifugation to quantify NADPH by redox cycling or used for confocal imaging after loading 10 \u03bcl of the bacterial suspension on a slide.\nTransformation of Nicotiana and Arabidopsis plants The complete sequence encoding NERNST was PCR-amplified and cloned into the SacI/SalI sites of the plant binary vector pCHF3 under control of the constitutive cauliflowermosaic virus 35S promoter (P35S, Supplementary Table 1). The cytosolic version (pPM008) was amplified from pPM002 with primers oAK001/oAK002 (Supplementary\nTable 3). For chloroplast targeting, the biosensor-encoding DNA was amplified with the same primers and fused in-frame to the 5\u2019 end of a 122-bp sequence encoding the transit peptide (TP) of pea ferredoxinNADP+ reductase in plasmid pCHF3-TP-FLV182, from which the FLV1 sequence had been removed, to yield pPM006. These plant vectors were used to transform Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101 PMP90 by electroporation and selection with 100\u03bcg/ml spectinomycin in LB-agar plates. Stable transformations of Nicotiana tabacum cv. Petit Havana and Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia (Col-0) were carried out by published procedures58,59. In the case of tobacco, recombinant plasmidswere introduced into theplant genome through Agrobacterium\u2013mediated leaf disc transformation58. Discs were immersed in liquid culture of transformed Agrobacterium, and cocultivated in Murashige and Skoog (MS) 0,8% agar supplemented with 1 \u00b5g/ml kinetin (Sigma) and 0.1 \u00b5g/ml naftalen acetic acid (Sigma) (regeneration medium) for two days83. At the end of this period, discs were transferred to the regeneration medium supplemented with 50 \u00b5g/ml cefotaxime to kill the bacteria and 100 \u00b5g /ml kanamycin to select the transformed plants. After two months the rooted plantlets were transferred to soil. Homozygous lines were selected by following kanamycin resistance in the progeny of self-pollinated primary transformants up to the T3 generation. Seeds were germinated on halfstrength MS (0.5 \u00d7 MS) agar plates supplemented with 2% (w/v) sucrose and 50 \u00b5g/ml kanamycin. Arabidopsis plantswere transformed using the floral dip procedure59. Plants were grownuntil flowering, and the main inflorescence was cut to induce lateral branching and favor transformation by dipping the cut inflorescences in Agrobacterium cultures. T1 seeds were collected after 30/45 days. The selection of transformants was also conducted in 0.5 \u00d7 MS-agar plates without sucrose and supplemented with 50 \u00b5g/ml cefotaxime, 100 \u00b5g /ml kanamycin, and followed up to the T3 generation to obtain homozygous lines. Two cytosolic lines exhibiting good expression levels (101-3-3 and 101-9-10 of tobacco, 101-2-4 and 101-2-6 of Arabidopsis) and two chloroplast-targeted lines (99-3-2 and 99-7-1 of tobacco, 99-4- 6 and 99-4-11 of Arabidopsis) were used throughout this work. Tobacco plants were grown at 200 \u03bcmol quanta m\u22122 s\u22121, 16-h photoperiod and 25 \u00b0C (tobacco chamber conditions), whereas Arabidopsis\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:3277 12\nplants were cultured at 135 \u00b5mol quanta m\u22122 s\u22121, 8-h photoperiod and 22 \u00b0C/18 \u00b0C (Arabidopsis chamber conditions).\nTransient transformation of Nicotiana benthamiana was carried out by infiltrating the youngest fully expanded leaves of 22- day old plants84 using A. tumefaciens strain EHA105 carrying the pCHF3-derived vectors described above. Plants were grown under tobacco chamber conditions. Transiently expressed products showed maximum fluorescence at 72 h, as revealed by microscopic inspection.\nStress treatments on tobacco plants expressing NERNST The youngest fully expanded leaves of soil-grown 7-week-old tobacco plants were used for all assays. Unless otherwise stated, experiments were carried out under tobacco chamber conditions. For the analysis of light effects, leaves were illuminated at 200 \u03bcmol quanta m\u22122 s\u22121 or dark-adapted for 3 h. Drought stress was visualized in detached leaves that were air-dried for 3 h. Controls were kept in distilled water for the same time. Salt stress was imposed by incubating leaf discs (12mm in diameter) with either water, 0.25M NaCl or 0.5M NaCl for 16 h. For the biotic stress assay, detached leaves were punctured with 100\u03bcl of a suspension of the necrotrophic bacterium Pectobacterium carotovorum corresponding to 108 colony forming units (CFU)/ml in LB medium85, and incubated under tobacco chamber conditions for 16 h.\nFor image acquisition, leaf tissue of Arabidopsis or N. tabacum/benthamiana expressing NERNST targeted to the cytosol or chloroplasts were placed in a drop of distilled water on a microscope slide. Imaging of roots was performed in the same form. Leaf discs treated with DTT or H2O2 were vacuum-infiltrated for 20min in order to obtain the fully reduced or oxidized sensor."

Primers used for amplification were oPM001 and oPM002 for Wt and mutant NERNST, oPM028 and oPM029 for NOX and oPM019, and oPM002 for roGFP2 (Supplementary Table 3). For mitochondrial targeting, the transit peptide of subunit 8 from the human cytochrome c oxidase complex was amplified from pCDNA3.1-MitoGFP, using oPM034/oPM035 as internal and oPM036/oPM037 as external primers, in a nested PCR reaction placed in one tube (Supplementary Table 3). The amplified fragment was cloned in-frame to the 5\u2019-end of the NERNST coding sequence in plasmid pPM014, to yield pPM026 (Supplementary\nTable 1).\nSuspensions containing 2 \u00d7 105 cells were transfected using polyethyleneimine (PEI; Polysciences Inc. Europe, Hirschberg, Germany; no.23966-1) as described by M\u00fcller et al.89. Briefly, aliquots containing 3 \u00b5g of DNAwere diluted in 200 \u00b5l of OptiMEM (Invitrogen) and mixed with 10 \u00b5l of PEI solution in 200 \u00b5l of OptiMEM under vortexing. After 15min of incubation at 25 \u00b0C, the PEI-OptiMEM-DNA precipitate was added to the cells. The culture medium was replaced 4 h after the transfection. All plasmids were transfected in equal amounts (w:w). Cells were imaged at 24 h post-transfection in a confocal microscope.\nFor experiments carried out with the PerkinElmer Operetta CLS confocal high-content imaging system, 1 \u00d7 106 HeLa cells were seeded and transfected in Petri Dishes (Corning 430167, Corning, Inc) in\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:3277 13\nDMEMcomplete. Four h after transfection, the culture was trypsinised and 1.5 \u00d7 104 cells in fresh medium were transferred to optical quality 96-well plates (PerkinElmer Cell Carrier Ultra 96-well) and imaged the following day."

Cells were suspended in Live Cell Imaging Solution (LCIS, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA) containing 20mM HEPES pH 7.4, 140mM NaCl, 2.5mM KCl, 1.8mM CaCl2, 1mM MgCl2, supplemented with high glucose (4.5 g/l). Two hours later, a 2\u00d7 solution containing the G6PDH inhibitor (G6PDi-171, Biomol GmbH) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (for control) was added to each well andmeasured every 5min for 4 h. The entire experiment was carried out on a single plate.\nFor diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI, Sigma Aldrich St. Louis, MO) experiments, the reagent was added to a final concentration of 50 \u00b5M and its effects measured after 5min of incubation in a confocal microscope.\nIn vitro mRNA transcription, animal handling and microinjection of zebrafish embryos DNA sequences encoding NERNST and HyPerRed, a fluorescent H2O2 sensor76, were PCR-amplified from pPM003 and pC1-HyPerRed (Addgene plasmid # 48249; http://n2t.net/addgene:48249; RRID: Addgene_48249; Supplementary Table 1) using primers oAK003/ oAK004 and oAK005/oAK006, respectively (Supplementary Table 3). The amplified products were cloned in the pCS2+MT vector system between the SP6 promoter and SV40 terminator to yield plasmids pAK001 andpAK002 (Supplementary Table 1). Theywere purifiedwith the Wizard DNA purification system (Promega, Madison, WI) and linearized by digestion with NotI. Forty ng of linearized plasmid were in vitro transcribed with the mMESSAGE mMACHINE\u00ae SP6 Transcription Kit from Ambion (Thermo Fisher) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\nAdult zebrafish were maintained at 28 \u00b0C on a 14:10 h light:dark cycle as previously described90. Zebrafish matings were carried out by crossing three males and four females in the same spawning tank. All embryos were staged according to morphological development in hours post-fertilization (hpf) at 28 \u00b0C (ref. 91) and handled in compliance with relevant international guidelines (Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and American Veterinary Medical Association, https://zfin.org/). Embryoswere injected at the 1-cell stage into the yolk immediately below the cell using a gas-driven microinjection apparatus (MPPI-2 Pressure Injector, Applied scientific Instrumentation; Eugene,OR,USA). Five nl of 100ng/\u03bcl dilutions of the NADP(H) and H2O2 sensor mRNAs were co-microinjected. Embryos were allowed to developuntil 48 hpf at 28 \u00b0C,manually dechorionated, and treated with tricaine92. Larvae were placed on a 1.2% (w/v) agarose chamber and tail fin tips were cut with a sharper under a scope. The injured larvaeweremounted on a dropof 3% (w/v)methyl cellulose for visualization by confocal microscopy. The tail fin tip experiment and quantification were independently repeated three times with at least four specimens each.\nConfocal laser microscopy and image analysis Images of bacteria, whole plant and zebrafish were taken with a Zeiss 8000 laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss ZEN BLACK 2.3 software), whereas images of protoplasts and mammalian cells were obtained with a Nikon Eclipse Ti with C2 Plus confocal laser scanning microscope (NIS-Elements imaging 5.01. software). In both cases, samples were excited at 405/488 nm and the emission was collected at 510 nm52. Chlorophyll auto-fluorescence was detected following excitation at 488 nm and emission at 650 nm. For coimaging of NADP(H) and H2O2 dynamics, the intensiometric\nHyperRed sensor was excited at 543 nm and its fluorescence emission measured at 610 nm. The final processing of images was carried out with the ImageJ software.\nExcitation filters at 355\u2013385 nm and 460\u2013490 nm were used for images obtained with the PerkinElmer Operetta CLS confocal highcontent imaging system (Harmony 4.8 software). The emission filter was selected for light between 500 and 550 nm. To labelmitochondria, cells were incubated with the MitoTracker Red CMXRos probe (Invitrogen) and followed by excitation using a filter at 530\u2013560 nm, with the corresponding emission recording at 570-650nm. Images were analyzed with the CellProfiler software93 and KNIME.\nDynamic ranges were determined by image analysis after exposing the different systems to reductants (DTT) and oxidants (H2O2 or diamide) as follows: a) bacteria, 10min with 10mM DTT or 10mM H2O2; b)mammalian cells, 2min with 10mMDTT, 10mMH2O2, 10mM diamide; c) leaves, 20min in a vacuum chamber with 50mM DTT or 50mM H2O2; d) leaf protoplasts, 5\u201310min with 10mM DTT or 10mM H2O2."

Raw data were exported to ImageJ as 32-bit TIFF files and the complete field or a user\u2019s defined Region of Interest52 (ROI), when indicated, were taken for analysis. Determinations of R values were corrected for background emission intensity by subtracting the intensity of an adjacent cell-free ROI and using the Otsu algorithm threshold to generate masks of positive expression. The corrected 405-nm fluorescence intensity image was divided by the corrected 488-nm fluorescence intensity image to produce a ratio image on a pixel by pixel basis through the command \u201cImage Expression Parser\u201d. The grayscales of the ratio images were colored using the ImageJ look-up table \u2018Fire\u2019. Image analysis was automated through scripts we developed using ImageJ macros. Data obtained from ImageJ were imported, concatenated and prepared for analysis in RStudio (RStudio: Integrated Development for R, http://www. rstudio.com/). Images of zebrafish were taken from stacks acquired with an 18-\u00b5m Z-axis scaling. The maximum intensity projection of each stack was used for ratio processing, as previously described. Longitudinal studies in mammalian cells were carried out by using an ROI in the images obtained over time. This allowed \u201cCell-by-Cell\u201d tracking.\nFor experiments carried out in the PerkinElmer Operetta CLS confocal high-content imaging system, image analyses were performed with custom scripts and the CellProfiler93 image analysis software. Numeric data were further processed using the KNIME data analysis platform and the R programming language. Analysis pipelines for both software packages and R scripts are available in the GitHub repository found at https://github.com/PameeMolinari/NCOMMS-2205375-T 94.\nNADP(H) quantification by redox cycling The protocol of Slater et al.55 was modified to determine NADP(H) levels in bacterial extracts. Briefly, E. coli BL21 DE3 cells transformed with pM002/3 and pGroE7 (Supplementary Table 1) were grown for 16 h at 37 \u00b0C in LB or the corresponding minimal media and collected by centrifugation. For the determination of total NADP(H) contents, pellets were suspended in 400 \u00b5l of 0.2M NaOH, immediately neutralized with 100 \u00b5l of 1M Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and 200 \u00b5l of 0.2 N HCl, and centrifuged for 5min at 16,000 g. Then, 200 \u00b5l of the supernatants were adjusted to pH 8 with a microelectrode. For NADPH measurements, cellular pellets were suspended in 400 \u00b5l of 0.2M NaOH, and centrifuged. The NADP+ present in a 200-\u00b5l aliquot of the supernatants was destroyed by heating at 95 \u00b0C for 90 s, the solution cooled immediately in ice and neutralized as described before. The reaction was carried out in 1ml of 25mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 3.6mM G6P,\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:3277 14\n100mM 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol, 0.5mM phenazine methosulphate, 1 unit/ml G6PDH and 5-50 \u00b5l sample, following the change of absorbance at 600 nm in a Shimadzu spectrophotometer (UVProbe ver. 3.1. software). Concentrations were calculated from a standard curve (0\u2013400 pmol NADPH). NADP+ contents were calculated by difference.\nA similar protocol was employed to determine NADP(H) levels in whole-leaf extracts. Briefly, 100mg of tobacco or Arabidopsis leaves were collected in eppendorf tubes and immediately frozen in liquidN2. The youngest fully expanded leaves from 7-week-old tobacco or 4- week-old Arabidopsis plants were used. For the determination of NADP+ or NADPH contents, the tissue was ground and suspended in 0.2 N HCl or 0.2N NaOH, respectively. After centrifugation, an aliquot was separated and the NADPH or NADP+ present in the respective sample was selectively destroyed by heating at 100 \u00b0C for 60 s. The extracts were immediately neutralized and the reaction was carried out as described before. Concentrations were calculated from a standard curve."
