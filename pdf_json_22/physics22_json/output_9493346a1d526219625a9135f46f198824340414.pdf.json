Motivated by the recently reported strong occurrence of endogenous co-jumps (simultaneous price jumps of several assets) we extend QHawkes to a multivariate framework (MQHawkes), that is considering several financial assets and their interactions. Assuming that quadratic kernels write as the sum of a time-diagonal component and a rank one (trend) contribution, we investigate endogeneity ratios and the resulting stationarity conditions. We then derive the so-called Yule-Walker equations relating covariances and feedback kernels, which are essential to calibrate the MQHawkes process on empirical data. Finally, we investigate the volatility distribution of the process and find that, as in the univariate case, its tail exhibits power-law behavior, with a unique exponent that can be exactly computed in some limiting cases.\nKeywords: Multivariate QHawkes\nINTRODUCTION\nModelling the volatility of financial assets is a significant challenge for academics, market participants and regulators alike. In fact, models describing the statistics of price changes are widely used for, e.g., risk control and derivative pricing. When not in line with the behaviour of real markets, these models can lead to disappointing outcomes, or even major mishaps. Thus, it is important to account for the main stylized facts observed in real price time series, in particular: fat tails of the returns distribution, multi-timescale volatility clustering, price-volatility correlations and time reversal asymmetry.\nAmong the most widely used models, one can quote stochastic volatility models and GARCH models. However, these models often capture only poorly the above stylized facts. Indeed, the most popular stochastic volatility models lead to thin tails in the returns distribution, and to strict time reversal symmetry. Whereas GARCH models do present time reversal asymmetry, such asymmetry is actually stronger than that observed in real markets. Furthermore, GARCH volatility clustering is governed by a single time scale. Some of these problems are elegantly solved by the family of rough volatility models [1], in particular the multifractal random walk which is but a special member of that family [2, 3].\nHawkes processes, on the other hand, provide an interesting alternative to more traditional models, while\n\u2217 michael.benzaquen@polytechnique.edu\nclearly highlighting the feedback loop at the origin of the stylized facts characterizing financial prices. However, Jaisson and Rosenbaum [4] have shown that the continuous time limit of a (near-critical) Hawkes process is a fractional CIR Heston process, which is characterized by tails that are too thin to reproduce empirical returns distribution. Furthermore, such a process is again time reversal invariant.\nTo alleviate these problems, Donier, Blanc, Bouchaud in [5] introduced the family of \u201cQuadratic\u201d Hawkes (QHawkes) processes, which encodes a feedback between past price trends and future volatility, a clear empirical effect first discovered by Zumbach [6], see also [7]. The quadratic feedback allows one to overcome the limitations of standard (linear) Hawkes processes. QHawkes processes naturally generate fat tail distributions and time reversal asymmetry even in the continuous time limit.\nIn this paper, we generalize the monovariate QHawkes process of Ref. [5] to the multivariate case, allowing one to capture how the trend on one asset can impact the volatility of another asset. Like for the univariate case, we expect the multivariate expansion to capture some stylised facts that are not accounted for within a linear Hawkes framework. In order to motivate our study, we illustrate in Figure 1 the existence of a cross-asset leverage and Zumbach effects, i.e. the fact that past trends on the S&P500 (resp. tbond) increases volatility of the tbond (resp. S&P500), in a way that is asymmetric between past and future, much as the usual \u201cself\u201d Zumbach effect. Figure 2 reveals high activity episodes across the whole stock market, with the number of simultaneous co-jumps being distributed as a power-law. This suggests the existence ar X iv :2\n20 6.\n10 41\n9v 3\n[ q-\nfi n.\nT R\n] 1\n4 Fe\nb 20\n23\ndominant leverage effect). We plot the correlation between the volatility \u03c32t and the squared returns R2t,\u03c4 on scale \u03c4 , showing a clear asymmetry between past and future, specially from past tbond trends towards S&P500 volatility. The daily volatility \u03c32 is computed as the mean of the square returns on 5 min windows over one day (overnight excluded). Aggregated returns are defined as Rt,\u03c4 := P closet\u22121 /P open t\u22121+\u03c4 \u2212 1 for \u03c4 < 0 and\nRt,\u03c4 := P close t+1+\u03c4/P open t+1 \u2212 1 for \u03c4 > 0.

The data covers the period 2013-2018.\nof a propagation phenomenon similar to a branching process, which requires a specific non-linear cross-asset interaction of the type considered in this paper.\nThe outline of the paper is as follows. In Section I, we define the multivariate QHawkes model in full generality. Section II establishes generalized Yule-Walker equations that relate 2- and 3-point correlation functions to the various feedback kernels appearing in the definition of the model. These relations are the starting point for the calibration of the model to empirical data, a topic we will explore in a follow-up, companion paper [8]. Section III investigates the volatility distribution generated by the model and establishes the power-law nature of the tails, with an exponent that we analytically compute in several special cases. In Section IV we conclude.\nBesides, a notation table is provided after the bibliography to ease the reading (See Appendix 1).\nI. MODEL PRESENTATION\nIn this section, we introduce Multivariate Quadratic Hawkes processes (MQHawkes). We start by recalling the definition of Hawkes and Quadratic Hawkes processes in their univariate form. We then define their extension to the multivariate case, with a special focus on the bivariate case. Next we introduce a much simplified specification, where the quadratic feedback can be factorized into a product of trend indicators \u2013 a limit called ZHawkes in [5], after Zumbach\u2019s seminal work on the time reversal asymmetry of financial time series. We discuss endogeneity ratios and stationarity conditions for MQHawkes within the ZHawkes framework. Finally, we further generalize the MQHawkes model to take into account the possible intrinsic correlations between the underlying (inhomogeneous) Poisson processes.\nthe circle encodes the number of stocks simultaneously jumping in a given minute (see color bar). The insert shows the cumulative distribution function of the number of stocks in co-jumps for jumps that were classified as endogenous according to the methodology developed in [9], the slope is \u22121.25.\nA. Hawkes and QHawkes Processes\nHawkes processes were first introduced to model earthquakes [10, 11]. Their ability to consider the past events in the probability of a future event was indeed very useful to reproduce the aftershock phenomenon:\n3 an earthquake is in fact more likely to occur after another just took place. This same property appeared to hold in a variety of fields, like biological neural networks [12, 13], financial markets [14, 15], and also crime rates or riot propagation [16, 17].\nA Hawkes process (Nt)t\u22650 is an inhomogenous1 Poisson process with intensity \u03bbt defined from the past realisations of the process itself, according to:\n\u03bbt = \u03bb\u221e + \u222b t \u2212\u221e \u03c6(t\u2212 u) dNu (1)\nwith\nn = \u222b R \u03c6(u) du < 1, (2)\nwhere \u03bb\u221e is the baseline intensity, \u03c6 is the feedback kernel and n represents the \u201cendogeneity ratio\u201d, which needs to be strictly less than unity in order to guarantee that the process reaches a stationary state.\nLike Hawkes processes, QHawkes processes are inhomogenous Poisson processes with an intensity defined from past events. In the context of financial markets, the event process (Nt)t>0 represents the sequence of prices changing events, where the price change is defined by dPt = t\u03c8dNt [5] where t = \u00b11 (random sign), and \u03c8 is the tick size (the smallest unit of price change) which we set to one henceforth. The intensity self-exciting feedback loop is now defined on the returns dPt rather than on the events dNt. Hence, the sign of the returns influences the process intensity [5]:\n\u03bbt =\u03bb\u221e + \u222b t \u2212\u221e L(t\u2212 s) dPs\n+ \u222b\u222b t \u2212\u221e K(t\u2212 s, t\u2212 u) dPsdPu, (3)\nwhere \u03bb\u221e is again the baseline intensity, L(\u00b7) is the socalled leverage kernel (capturing the increase of activity following a drop in prices) and K(\u00b7, \u00b7) is the quadratic kernel.\nFollowing empirical findings of [5], we simplify the quadratic kernel K assuming it can be written as a general time-diagonal and a rank one contribution:\nK(s, u) = \u03c6(s)\u03b4(s\u2212 u) + k(s)k(u). (4)\nThis defines what we shall refer to as the ZHawkes\n1 Here, inhomogenous means that the intensity of the process is time dependent.\nmodel:\n\u03bbt =\u03bb\u221e + \u222b t \u2212\u221e L(t\u2212 s) dPs + \u222b t \u2212\u221e \u03c6(t\u2212 s) dNs\n+ (\u222b t \u2212\u221e k(t\u2212 s) dPs )2 ,\n(5)\nwhere we have used (dPs)2 = dNs. Note that the diagonal term precisely reproduces the standard Hawkes feedback.\nB. MQHawkes Processes\nLet us now consider N financial assets with prices (P it )t\u22650,i=1,...,N . We associate such price processes with jump processes (N it )t\u22650, with:\ndP it = i\u03c8idN i t , (6)\nwhere we set henceforth \u03c8i \u2261 1, \u2200i, without loss of generality. Each jump process (N it )t\u22650 is a conditionally independent2 Quadratic Hawkes process with intensity (\u03bbi,t)t\u22650\n\u03bbi,t =\u03bbi,\u221e + N\u2211 j=1 \u222b t \u2212\u221e Lij(t\u2212 s) dP js\n+ N\u2211 j\u2264k \u222b\u222b t \u2212\u221e Kijk(t\u2212 s, t\u2212 u) dP js dP ku . (7)\nNote that the superscript in the kernels indicates which asset is affected by the feedback, whereas subscripts indicate which assets are responsible for it.\nIn the following we shall generically call Kd the \u201cdiagonal\u201d feedback terms, i.e. the kernels Kijk with j = k. These terms describe the quadratic feedback from two price changes of the same asset j onto the activity of asset i. Similarly, K\u00d7 describes cross effects, i.e. Kijk with j < k, from two different assets j 6= k onto the activity of asset i. In order to guarantee that intensities \u03bbit remain positive at all times, kernels L,Kd and K\u00d7 need to verify some conditions, which are detailed in Appendix 2.\nAlthough all these terms could in principle play a role, in the present paper we shall restrict to cross terms Kijk such that either j or k are equal to i. The intuitive meaning of such terms will become clear below in the context of ZHawkes processes; in particular we shall see\n2 This means that for given intensities \u03bbi,t, the inhomogeneous Poisson processes dN it are independent. See further down for the case of correlated jump processes.\n4 why terms with j 6= i and k 6= i are not expected to play a large role in practice.\nFor the sake of clarity we will mainly focus on the bivariate case N = 2, for which the leverage kernel and the diagonal quadratic kernel are 2\u00d7 2 matrices:\nL := ( L11 L 1 2\nL21 L 2 2\n) ; Kd := ( K111 K 1 22\nK211 K 2 22\n) ,\nwhereas the cross quadratic kernel is a vector\nK\u00d7 := ( K112 K212 ) .\nIn the following 2 \u00d7 2 matrices and 2D vectors are respectively noted A and A, for example \u03bb := (\u03bb1, \u03bb2). We will also need to distinguish the \u201ctime diagonal\u201d of a matrix A(\u03c41, \u03c42), by which we mean A(\u03c4, \u03c4), from the \u201cdiagonal\u201d of A, which refers to the diagonal components in asset space Aii.\nC. ZHawkes Model\nThe multivariate generalisation of the ZHawkes model amounts to assuming that the quadratic kernels Kd and K\u00d7 can be written as arbitrary singular timediagonal and time-rank-one contributions, to wit:\nKijj(s, u) = (\u03c6d) i jj(s) \u03b4(s\u2212 u) + kijj(s)kijj(u)\nKiij(s, u) = (\u03c6\u00d7) i ij(s) \u03b4(s\u2212 u) + kiji(s)kiij(u) (i < j).\nHowever, as long as we consider independent Poisson processes, we can set \u03c6\u00d7 = 0. This is because the two processes will almost never jump simultaneously, such that for all u, dP iudP ju = 0 when i 6= j (see however Eq. (11) below when co-jumps are taken into account). Actually in the so-called Thinning Algorithm [18] for multivariate processes, commonly used to simulate inhomogenous Poisson process, at most one process can be jumping at each time step.\nD. Endogeneity Ratio and Stationarity Condition\nThe endogeneity ratios indicate by how much, on average, the feedback loop contributes to the future of the process, and thus, whether the process is stationary or not. To define them for the MQHawkes we use analogies with univariate QHawkes and multivariate linear Hawkes.\n1. Mean Intensity\nSince price changes are centred and processes are assumed to be independent, we have E(dP ) = 0 and\nE(dP isdP ju) = \u03b4ij\u03b4s,u\u03bb\u0304ids. Using this, we find that the vector of mean intensities \u03bb\u0304, when finite, writes:\n\u03bb\u0304 = ( I\u2212 \u222b \u221e 0 Kd(s, s)ds )\u22121 \u03bb\u221e. (8)\nThis expression must be interpreted with care when Kd(s, u) contains a singular time-diagonal contribution d(s) \u03b4(s\u2212u). In such a case, and throughout this paper, we will interpret Kd(s, s) as Kd,reg.(s, s) + d(s), where Kd,reg. is the regular part of the diagonal quadratic feedback. Equation (8) shows that the mean intensity diverges when the spectral radius3 of the matrix\u222b\u221e 0 Kd(s, s)ds tends to one from below.\n2. Endogeneity Ratio\nIn the multidimensional case, the endogeneity ratio of a standard linear Hawkes process is defined by the spectral radius of the kernel matrix involved in the expression of \u03bb\u0304 [14]. More precisely, introducing\n\u2016f\u2016 := \u222b +\u221e 0 f(s)ds\none constructs the matrix \u2016(\u03c6)ij\u2016 and determines its eigenvalue with largest modulus, which in turn defines the dominant endogeneity ratio n. Thus, n = \u03c1spectral(\u2016 \u2016), where \u03c1spectral is the spectral radius and \u2016 \u2016 stands for the matrix \u2016(\u03c6)ij\u2016.\nFor a general univariate QHawkes model, one can always decompose the endogeneity ratio n as the sum of the Hawkes endogeneity ratio nH associated with the singular time-diagonal contribution toK(\u00b7, \u00b7), and a regular contribution nQ:\nn = \u222b +\u221e 0 \u03c6(s)ds+ \u222b +\u221e 0 Kreg.(s, s)ds := nH+nQ. (9)\nIn the special case of a ZHawkes quadratic kernel, the regular contribution reads:\nnQ = nZ = \u222b +\u221e 0 k2(s)ds. (10)\nFor a general MQHawkes, the endogeneity ratio is then defined by the spectral radius of \u222b\u221e 0\nKd(s, s)ds, n = \u03c1spectral(\u2016Kd\u2016). However, when decomposing the kernel as a singular time-diagonal contribution and a regular contribution, one must be careful about the fact that the two matrices Kd,reg.(s, s) and d do not\n3 The spectral radius of a square matrix is the maximum of the absolute values of its eigenvalues.\n5 commute in general. Hence the spectral radius defining the endogeneity ratio cannot be simply expressed as the sum of a Hawkes contribution nH (i.e. the spectral radius of \u2016 d\u2016) and of a regular or Zumbach contribution (i.e. the spectral radius of \u2016Kd,reg.\u2016).\n3. Stationarity Condition\nFor linear Hawkes processes to be stationary, the endogeneity ratio n needs to be strictly less than one. Hence, only processes with finite mean intensity \u03bb\u0304 can be stationary. In the presence of a quadratic feedback, the situation is more intricate. In a previous communication [19] we found that for a univariate Z-Hawkes process to be stationary one needs nH < 1, but not necessarily n = nH + nQ < 1. When nH < 1 and n > 1 one has a stationary process with an infinite mean. In the present multivariate framework, we conjecture that a similar situation holds, with the following definitions: let nH be the spectral radius of \u2016 d\u2016, and n = \u03c1spectral(\u2016Kd\u2016), with in general n 6= nH+nQ. Then, there exists a value n? such that:\n\u2022 if nH < 1 and n < n?, the process is stationary with finite mean intensity;\n\u2022 if nH < 1 and n > n? the process is stationary with infinite mean intensity.\n\u2022 if nH > 1, the process explodes and no stationary state can be reached.\nWe have performed numerical simulations (not shown) that support this conjecture. The value of the critical point n? is however difficult to compute in the general case, but in the specific case of a weakly anisotropic two dimensional ZHawkes model, some progress can be made, see Section IIID 2 and Eq. (36). In particular, in the isotropic case, the univariate result n? = 1 is recovered.\nE. Correlated Poisson Processes\nOne may wonder if the hypothesis of independence of the dN it for different i = 1, . . . , N is not too strong to faithfully account for events happening in financial markets. In fact, as in [20], we find that co-jumps (i.e. simultaneous jumps in the price of different assets within 1 minute bins) occur fairly frequently, adding a new stylised fact to consider in this multivariate framework. In order to investigate co-jumps empirically, we use a jump detection method (see [9]) on 295 large cap. US stock prices from January 2015 to December 2020. We then count how many stocks display anomalous price jumps in a given minute, and represented such counts\nin Figure 2. Co-jumps are clearly seen to occur. On average, there are 4.5 co-jumps per day, and up to 68 co-jumps in one day. Using [9] to classify each jump as endogenous or exogenous, we compute the cumulative density function of number of stocks included in endogenous co-jumps which displays a power law of slope \u22121.25 (see insert in Fig. 2).\nCo-jumps may be due to either a common exogenous shock (like an external piece of news affecting several stocks), or to some endogenous instability triggering a jump for one given stock, which propagates to other stocks. The very interesting question of the exogenous/endogenous nature of co-jumps clearly needs a more refined investigation, in the spirit of [9], and is left for future work.\nIn [20], the authors show that multivariate linear Hawkes models with independent realisations of the Poisson process do not satisfactorily reproduce cojumps. Here we propose a way to enforce correlations between Poisson processes, and allow one to account for co-jumps within bivariate QHawkes processes.\n1. Bivariate Poisson Processes\nWe focus on the bivariate case N = 2. The extension to N > 2 is also possible, although beyond the scope of the present paper. In order to allow for the possibility of co-jumps, i.e. such that dP 1t dP 2t 6= 0, we consider three independent QHawkes counting processes (N1t , N2t , N ct )t\u22650 with intensities (\u00b51,t, \u00b52,t, \u00b5c,t) defined from past returns:\n\u00b5a,t =\u00b5a,\u221e + \u2211\nj\u2208{1,2}\n\u222b t \u2212\u221e Laj (t\u2212 s)dP js\n+ \u2211\nj\u2264k\u2208{1,2}\n\u222b\u222b t \u2212\u221e Qajk(t\u2212 s, t\u2212 u)dP js dP ku ,\n(11) with a = 1, 2, c, and we model price moves as:\ndP 1t = 1 t (dN 1 t + dN c t )\ndP 2t = 2 t (dN 2 t + dN c t ),\n(12)\nwhere it = \u00b11, with E( it) = 0 and E( 1t 2t ) = \u03c1t. While the sign correlation \u03c1t could indeed be time dependent, here we will assume that \u03c1t = \u03c1 is independent of time. Thus, price moves have both an idiosyncratic part, represented by dN i, i \u2208 {1, 2}, and a common part dN c, which make co-jumps possible4 (hence the subscript c).\n4 Note that if we relax the assumption that dP can only be equal to one tick, one can build a more general model\ndP 1t = 1 t (dN 1 t + C1dN c t )\ndP 2t = 2 t (dN 1 t + C2dN c t )\n6 In fact, because dN ct \u2208 {0, 1}, then (dN ct )2 = dN ct , one now has:\ndP 1t dP 2 t = 1 t 2 tdN c t . (13)\nWe can then define the total intensities (\u03bb1,t, \u03bb2,t)t\u22650 of the price jumps (P 1t , P 2t )t\u22650, according to the definition of Poisson processes:{\n\u03bb1,t := \u00b51,t + \u00b5c,t \u03bb2,t := \u00b52,t + \u00b5c,t,\n(14)\nand notice that the structure of the equations governing the dynamics of intensities is conveniently the same as in the independent case, with the following identifications:\nLi1 \u2190\u2212 Li1 + Lc1 Li2 \u2190\u2212 Li2 + Lc2 Ki11 \u2190\u2212 Qi11 +Qc11 Ki22 \u2190\u2212 Qi22 +Qc22 Ki12 \u2190\u2212 Qi12 +Qc12 \u03bbi\u221e \u2190\u2212 \u00b5i\u221e + \u00b5c\u221e.\n2. Mean Intensity\nNow correlations between instantanous price changes are non-zero, i.e. E(dP 1s dP 2s ) = \u03c1\u00b5cds 6= 0 (see Appendix 3), the expression for the mean intensity \u03bb\u0304 is modified and reads, for regular kernels:\n\u03bb\u0304 = ( I\u2212 \u222b \u221e 0 Kd(s, s)ds )\u22121\n(15)( \u03bb\u221e + \u03c1\u00b5c \u222b \u221e 0 K\u00d7(s, s)ds ) ,\nwith:\n\u00b5c = \u00b5c\u221e + \u03bb\u0304\n> \u00b7 \u222b\u221e 0 Qc(s, s)ds\n1\u2212 \u03c1 \u222b\u221e 0 Qc12(s, s)ds ,\nand\nQc = ( Qc11 Qc22 ) .\nIn the presence of a singular contribution to the K\u2019s, one should again take it into account by substituting all K(s, s) by the corresponding Kreg(s, s) + \u03c6(s), and similarly for Q\u2019s. The stationarity conditions are now that:\n1. The spectral radius of the Hawkes kernel || d|| is strictly less than 1\nwhich would lead to a richer correlation structure. Such a model would mean that co-jumps have a different size than usual price changes.\n2. The time-diagonal of the co-jump kernel must be such that:\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u03c1\u222b \u221e\n0\nQc12(s, s)ds \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 < 1. II. COVARIANCE STRUCTURE &\nYULE-WALKER EQUATIONS\nOf course, the feedback kernels L and K cannot be directly observed in data. However, as we now show, they can be computed from covariance functions, which can easily be estimated from empirical data. Here we introduce the covariance structures of a multivariate QHawkes process, thereby establishing the matrix YuleWalker equations (which link covariance structures and QHawkes kernels).\nIn order to fully characterise the kernels Kd and K\u00d7, we need covariance structures containing information on both the diagonal part of the kernels (\u03c41 = \u03c42) and their non diagonal part \u03c41 6= \u03c42. When time is discretized on a grid up to lag q, the number of unknowns is, for N assets, (q+q(q \u2212 1)/2)\u00d7N2 forKd and q(q \u2212 1)\u00d7N(N\u2212 1) unknowns for K\u00d7 (with i = j or i = k as considered in this paper and without explicit co-jumps).\nNow, Equation (20) below on two-point correlations can only provide q\u00d7N(N +1)/2 equations; three-point correlations are thus also needed to fully determine these kernels (see [5, 7] for the corresponding univariate case).\nA. Two- and Three-point Covariances\nThe first quantity of interest is the covariance of the activities of the process. For all \u03c4 6= 0:\nCij(\u03c4) := E (\ndN it dt dN jt\u2212\u03c4 dt\n) \u2212 \u03bb\u0304i\u03bb\u0304j . (16)\nAs for the univariate QHawkes, C is even, and its extension to \u03c4 = 0 can be worked out following [21]. Thus, for i = j, the extension will be the same as in [5], with C?ii(\u03c4) := Cii(\u03c4) + \u03b4\u03c4,0\u03bb\u0304i. (Note indeed that E((dN i)2) = E(dN i) = \u03bb\u0304idt, if we consider that events cannot overlap). For i 6= j, the extension must account for co-jumps and now reads C?ij(\u03c4) := Cij(\u03c4) + \u03b4\u03c4,0\u00b5\u0304c. Without co-jumps, one has C?ij(\u03c4) := Cij(\u03c4) for i 6= j.\nWe also define a relevant three-point correlation structure D as the following tensor:\nDijk(\u03c41, \u03c42) = E [(\ndN it dt \u2212 \u03bb\u0304i\n) dP jt\u2212\u03c41\ndt dP kt\u2212\u03c42 dt\n] . (17)\nSince price returns are assumed to be of martingales, Dijk(\u03c41, \u03c42) is only nonzero when \u03c41 > 0 and \u03c42 > 0.\n7 Note that when \u03c41 = \u03c42 and j = k, one has Dijj(\u03c4, \u03c4) = Cij(\u03c4).\nIn the bivariate case, D defines again two types of 2 \u00d7 2 matrices: \u201cdiagonal\u201d (j = k) and \u201ccross\u201d (j 6= k). We shall consistently use the following notations to distinguish them:\nDd(\u03c41, \u03c42) := ( D111(\u03c41, \u03c42) D122(\u03c41, \u03c42) D211(\u03c41, \u03c42) D222(\u03c41, \u03c42) ) , (18)\nand D\u00d7(\u03c41, \u03c42) = ( D112(\u03c41, \u03c42) D121(\u03c41, \u03c42) D212(\u03c41, \u03c42) D221(\u03c41, \u03c42) ) . (19)\nB. Two-point Yule-Walker Equations\nIn order to deduce kernels from empirical correlations, direct relations must be determined. The method we use to find such relations is very similar to that used in Appendix 1 of [5]. Assuming that prices are martingales,5 and without considering co-jumps, we find the following matrix equation for C:\nC(\u03c4) = Kd(\u03c4) + \u222b +\u221e 0+ Kd(u, u)C(\u03c4 \u2212 u)du\n+ 2 \u222b +\u221e 0+ \u222b +\u221e u+ Kd(\u03c4 + u, \u03c4 + r)Dd(u, r)drdu\n+ \u222b +\u221e 0+ \u222b +\u221e u+ K\u00d7(\u03c4 + u, \u03c4 + v)(D\u00d7) >(u, v)dvdu\n+ \u222b +\u221e 0+ \u222b +\u221e v+ K\u00d7(\u03c4 + u, \u03c4 + v)(D\u00d7) >(u, v)dudv,\n(20) where is a 2\u00d7 2 matrix defined as\n:= ( \u03bb\u03041 0 0 \u03bb\u03042 ) . (21)\nand where\nD\u00d7 := ( D112 D212 ) (22)\nThis Yule-Walker equation boils down to Eq. (8) of Ref. [5] in the univariate case.\nThe Yule-Walker equation for C accounting for cojumps can be found in Appendix 4.\n5 This assumption is often violated at high frequencies, and some amendments will need to be introduced when calibrating the model on actual HF data \u2013 see our Part II companion paper [8].\nC. Three-point Yule-Walker Equations\nThe full three-point Yule-Walker equations for the tensor D are quite intricate. In order to give a simplified version of these equations we restrict here to the case with no co-jumps, i.e. \u00b5c \u2261 0. We find that, for \u03c41 > \u03c42 > 0:\nDd(\u03c41, \u03c42) = 2Kd(\u03c41, \u03c42)Cd(\u03c42 \u2212 \u03c41)\n+ \u222b +\u221e \u03c4+1 Kd(u)Dd(\u03c41 \u2212 u, \u03c42 \u2212 u) du\n+ 2 \u222b +\u221e \u03c4+1 Kd(u, \u03c41)D0d(u\u2212 \u03c41, \u03c42 \u2212 \u03c41) du\n+ \u222b +\u221e \u03c4+1 K\u00d7(\u03c41, u)(D 1 \u00d7) >(u\u2212 \u03c41, \u03c42 \u2212 \u03c41)du\n+ \u222b +\u221e \u03c4+1 K\u00d7(u, \u03c41)(D 2 \u00d7) >(u\u2212 \u03c41, \u03c42 \u2212 \u03c41)du,\n(23)\nwhere we have introduced the two following diagonal matrices:\nCd(\u03c4) := ( C11(\u03c4) + (\u03bb\u03041)2 0 0 C22(\u03c4) + (\u03bb\u03042)2 ) , (24)\nD0d(\u03c41, \u03c42) := ( D111(\u03c41, \u03c42) 0 0 D222(\u03c41, \u03c42) ) , (25)\nas well as the notation D\u00d7 for the 2-vectors:\nD1\u00d7 :=\n( D121\n0\n) , D2\u00d7 := ( 0 D212 ) .\nFor the corresponding Yule-Walker equation for D\u00d7 see Appendix 4.\nD. Asymptotic Behavior with Power Law Kernels\nAn interesting special case for which the Yule-Walker equations can be asymptotically solved is when kernels are decaying as power-laws, as considered in [5]. Of special interest is the relationships between exponents governing the correlation functions and the kernel exponents when \u03c4 \u2212\u2192 +\u221e.\nThe general analysis is quite cumbersome and is relegated to Appendix 5 a. In the non-critical case (n < 1), the calculations are not particularly difficult and generalise the results of [5] to the multivariate case.\nThe critical case (n = 1), on the other hand, is much more subtle, in particular for the QHawkes processes.6 In order to treat this case, we have generalised\n6 For the linear version, one can refer to [7] or to [22] where Bacry, Jaisson and Muzy use convolution to link the Fourier transform of C with that of K.\n8 the method introduced by Hawkes in [23], which combines the Yule-Walker equations in the Fourier domain with Liouville\u2019s Theorem to find a direct relationship between exponents. This method is recalled in Appendix 5 b, from which the value of the exponents in the critical case can be derived, see Tables in Appendix 6. Some of the exponent values reported in [5] turn out to be incorrect; the correct values can be inferred from our new results. Note that in the critical case the decay of the correlation functions cannot be faster than \u03c4\u22121, as in the case of linear Hawkes models without ancestors (see the work of Br\u00e9maud & Massouli\u00e9 [24]).\nIII. POWER-LAW TAILS OF THE VOLATILITY DISTRIBUTION\nHere we investigate the distribution of volatility of a MQHawkes process. We adapt the methodology of Ref. [5] to the multivariate setting, restricting for simplicity to the two assets case. Our main goal is to establish that MQHawkes lead to fat (power-law) tails for the empirical intensity distribution, which translates into fat tails in the distribution of returns [5]. We limit our study to the ZHawkes specification with exponentially decaying kernels, that allow one to construct a tractable continuous time limit.\nA. ZHawkes Model with Exponential Kernels\nWe neglect the leverage feedback and set L = 0. We also neglect the possible presence of co-jumps, i.e. set \u00b5c \u2261 0 hereafter. Within the ZHawkes specification, we can rewrite the intensities as follows:{\n\u03bb1 = H 1 1 +H 1 2 + (Z 1 1 ) 2 + (Z12 ) 2 + Y 12 \u03bb2 = H 2 1 +H 2 2 + (Z 2 1 ) 2 + (Z22 ) 2 + Y 21\nwith\nHij := \u222b t \u2212\u221e (\u03c6d) i jj(t\u2212 s)dN js\nand\nZij = \u222b t \u2212\u221e kijj(t\u2212 s)dP js\nY ij = (\u222b t \u2212\u221e kiji(t\u2212 s)dP is )(\u222b t \u2212\u221e kiij(t\u2212 u)dP ju ) .\nTo keep things tractable, we choose all kernels to be exponentials and consider that only four \u201cfeatures\u201d are important to describe all feedback effects, namely:{\nh1(t) = \u03b21 \u222b t \u2212\u221e e\n\u2212\u03b21(t\u2212s)dN1s h2(t) = \u03b22 \u222b t \u2212\u221e e \u2212\u03b22(t\u2212s)dN2s , (26)\nfor activity feedback, and{ z1(t) = \u03c91 \u222b t \u2212\u221e e\n\u2212\u03c91(t\u2212s)dP 1s z2(t) = \u03c92 \u222b t \u2212\u221e e \u2212\u03c92(t\u2212s)dP 2s , (27)\nfor trend feedback, with \u03c9i\u2019s and \u03b2i\u2019s positive constants. From such features, we construct the quantities H,Z and Y as\nHi1 = n i H,1h1(t) H i 2 = n i H,2h2(t)\nZi1 = a i Z,1z1(t) Z i 2 = a i Z,2z2(t)\nY 12 = a 1 Z,\u00d7z1(t)z2(t) Y 2 1 = a 2 Z,\u00d7z1(t)z2(t).\nUnder such hypotheses, the intensities write:\n\u03bb1,t =\u03bb1,\u221e + n 1 H,1h1(t) + n 1 H,2h2(t) + (a 1 Z,1z1(t)) 2\n+ (a1Z,2z2(t)) 2 + a1Z,\u00d7z2(t)z1(t)\n\u03bb2,t =\u03bb2,\u221e + n 2 H,1h1(t) + n 2 H,2h2(t) + (a 2 Z,1z1(t)) 2\n+ (a2Z,2z2(t)) 2 + a2Z,\u00d7z2(t)z1(t).\n(28)\nB. Endogeneity Ratios\nAs mentioned earlier, the Hawkes endogeneity ratio nH is obtained as the spectral radius of the 2\u00d72 matrix of Hawkes coefficients, namely\nNH := ( n1H,1 n 1 H,2\nn2H,1 n 2 H,2\n) . (29)\nThe Zumbach endogeneity coefficient nZ is the spectral radius of the trend feedback kernel. In the monovariate case, one finds nZ = \u222b +\u221e 0\nk2(s)ds. From the features defined above, we now have kijj(t) = aiZ,j\u03c9je \u2212\u03c9jt. Noting that\n\u03c92 \u222b \u221e 0 e\u22122\u03c9s ds = \u03c9 2 ,\nwe simply need, in the present case, to find the top eigenvalue of the following 2\u00d7 2 matrix:\nNZ := 1\n2\n( (a1Z,1) 2\u03c91 (a 1 Z,2)\n2\u03c92 (a2Z,1) 2\u03c91 (a 2 Z,2) 2\u03c92\n) . (30)\nIn the simplest case when all coefficients and decay rates are equal, one finds that nH is equal to any of the coefficients niH,j (which are all equal), and nZ = a 2 Z\u03c9, where aZ := a i Z,j (again all equal).\nNote that in the general case, one needs to diagonalize the matrix NH +NZ , which leads to a total endogeneity ratio that is in general different from nH + nZ .\n9 C. Fokker-Planck Equation\nAs in [5], we consider the process on a time scale T > 0, that shall eventually tend to +\u221e, and simultaneously take all decay rates \u03b2, \u03c9 \u2192 0, but in such a way that \u03c9T and \u03b2T remain finite. For the Zumbach feedback not to disappear in this limit one needs to simultaneously scale up both (aiZ,j)i,j\u2208{1,2} as \u03c9\n\u22121/2 and (aiZ,\u00d7)i\u2208{1,2} as \u03c9\n\u22121. In this scaling regime, one can establish the following Fokker-Planck equation for the time dependent probability density pt of (h1, h2, z1, z2) (see Appendix 7):\n\u2202tpt =\u03b21\u2202h1 ( (h1 \u2212 \u03bb1,t)pt ) + \u03b22\u2202h2 ( (h2 \u2212 \u03bb2,t)pt ) + \u03c91\u2202z1 ( z1pt ) + \u03c92\u2202z2 ( z2pt\n) + \u03c921 2 \u22022z1z1 ( \u03bb1,tpt ) + \u03c922 2 \u22022z2z2 ( \u03bb2,tpt ) ,\n(31) where pt is a shorthand for pt(h1, h2, z1, z2), \u03bb1,t and \u03bb2,t are given by Eq. (28), and where we have disregarded co-jumps and direct correlations between the returns of asset 1 and asset 2, meaning that E(dP 1dP 2) = 0. The inclusion of such correlations can be considered and adds further cross-derivative terms \u22022z1z2 in the Fokker-Planck equation.\nSolving for the stationary distribution p\u221e of the Fokker Planck equation allows one to determine the tail behaviour of the distribution of intensities (which translate into volatilities since E[(dPt)2] = \u03bbtdt). In the monovariate case, Ref. [5] established that p\u221e decays as a power-law, with an exponent \u03b1 that depends on both nH and nZ . The general expression for \u03b1 is however not available in closed form, although asymptotic results in various regimes could be worked out, in particular when nH \u2192 0. The most important conclusion is that \u03b1\u2192\u221e when nZ \u2192 0, i.e. power-law tails disappear in the absence of a quadratic Zumbach coupling. Interestingly, the coupling between the Hawkes feedback with nH \u223c 1 and even a small Zumbach effect (nZ 1) was shown to generate an exponent compatible with empirical data.\nD. ZHawkes without Hawkes (nH = 0)\nTo make further analytical progress, we now consider the case in which the Hawkes coupling is absent (nH = 0), that is when h and z decouple, leading to a tractable two-dimensional Fokker-Planck for z1 and z2. In the stationary regime, the Fokker Planck equa-\ntion (31) becomes: 0 = \u03c91\u2202z1 ( z1p\u221e(z1, z2) ) + \u03c92\u2202z2 ( z2p\u221e(z1, z2) ) + \u03c921 2 \u22022z1z1 ( \u03bb1p\u221e(z1, z2) ) + \u03c922 2 \u22022z2z2 ( \u03bb2p\u221e(z1, z2) ) . (32) This equation describes the stationary measure of the stochastic path of the bivariate process (Z1, Z2)t defined as:\ndZ1 = \u2212\u03c91Z1dt+ \u03c91 \u221a \u03bb1,tdW 1 t\ndZ2 = \u2212\u03c92Z2dt+ \u03c92 \u221a \u03bb2,tdW 2 t ,\nwith\n\u03bb1,t = \u03bb1,\u221e + a 1 Z,\u00d7Z2Z1 + (a 1 Z,1Z1) 2 + (a1Z,2Z2) 2\n\u03bb2,t = \u03bb2,\u221e + a 2 Z,\u00d7Z2Z1 + (a 2 Z,2Z2) 2 + (a2Z,1Z1) 2. (33) These equations allow one to simulate paths (Z1, Z2)t numerically, from which an empirical determination of p\u221e(z1, z2) can be confronted to our analytical solution of Eq. (32). Note that the coefficients (aiZ,j)i,j\u2208{1,2} and (aiZ,\u00d7)i\u2208{1,2} must satisfy the following inequalities for \u03bb1,t and \u03bb2,t to remain positive at all times:\n4(aiZ,1a i Z,2) 2 \u2265 (aiZ,\u00d7)2, i = 1, 2.\nHow can one determine the tail exponent for such a two dimensional process? We first introduce polar coordinates (r, \u03b8), such that z1 = r cos \u03b8 and z2 = r sin \u03b8. We then surmise that when r2 max(\u03bb1,\u221e, \u03bb2,\u221e) the stationary distribution p\u221e(r, \u03b8) factorizes into an angular component F (\u03b8) and a power-law contribution, to wit: p\u221e(r, \u03b8) \u2248\nr\u2192\u221e F (\u03b8)r\u2212\u03b1, where \u03b1 is the tail exponent.\nNote that \u03b1 should be strictly larger than 2 for p\u221e to be normalisable, and strictly larger than 3 for the mean intensity to be non divergent. Injecting our factorized guess into Eq. (32) and taking the limit r2 \u03bb\u221e, we find a second order ODE on the function F , where \u03b1 appears as a parameter (see Appendix 8, Eq. (A.13)).\nThe value of \u03b1 is selected by the analogue of energy quantification in quantum mechanics: only for some special values of \u03b1 can one find a solution F of the above ODE that satisfies the correct boundary conditions compatible with symmetries of the problem. Clearly, F must be everywhere non-negative and, because of the symmetry z1 \u2192 \u2212z1 and z2 \u2192 \u2212z2, one must have F (\u03b8+\u03c0) = F (\u03b8) (see below for explicit examples). In principle, there can be more than one value of \u03b1 that allows one to find an acceptable solution F . This is the analogue of the energy spectrum in quantum mechanics. The value of \u03b1 that governs the tail behaviour of p\u221e(r, \u03b8) is then the smallest of all such acceptable values. Once the asymptotic tail behaviour of p\u221e(r, \u03b8) is known, it is easy to derive the tail behaviour of the marginals p\u221e(z1) and p\u221e(z2), which both behave as\n10\nz\u22121\u2212\u00b5 with \u00b5 = \u03b1\u2212 2. The volatility distribution then has the same tail behaviour.\nIn order to illustrate this general procedure on a simple example, we focus in the following on the case where ajZ,i = \u221a 2nZ/\u03c9i, \u2200i, j = 1, 2, such that the two eigenvalues of NZ are equal to nZ (the Zumbach endogeneity ratio) and 0. We also set aiZ,\u00d7 = 2\u03b3nZ/ \u221a \u03c91\u03c92, where \u03b3 is an arbitrary coefficient \u2208 (\u22122, 2) (such that \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 are always positive). When \u03c91 = \u03c92, Eq. (A.13) considerably simplifies and reads:\n[ (\u03b1\u2212 2) (\u03b1\u2212 \u03b10) + (\u03b1\u2212 2)2\u03b3 cos(\u03b8) sin(\u03b8) ] F (\u03b8) + [(1 + \u03b3 cos(\u03b8) sin(\u03b8))F (\u03b8)] \u2032\u2032 = 0, (34)\nwhere we have defined\n\u03b10 := 2 + 1\nnZ .\nNote that for a given value of \u03b1 this equation is invariant under the simultaneous change \u03b3 \u2192 \u2212\u03b3, \u03b8 \u2192 \u2212\u03b8. Hence the value of \u03b1 can only depend on |\u03b3|.\n1. The isotropic case \u03b3 = 0\nWhen cross terms aiZ,\u00d7 are absent and \u03c91 = \u03c92, the problem becomes isotropic in the sense that the dynamics of r2 = z21 +z22 decouple from that of \u03b8. The problem then boils down to the univariate ZHawkes model without Hawkes coupling, for which the value of \u03b1 is known, and given by \u03b10.\nFurthermore, the evolution of \u03b8 is that of a free Brownian motion on the unit circle, leading to a uniform distribution F (\u03b8) = F0, which is indeed a solution of Eq. (34) in this case. Note that other periodic solutions exist whenever\n(\u03b1\u2212 2)(\u03b1\u2212 \u03b10) = 4`2, ` = 0, 1, 2, . . .\nbut lead to larger values of \u03b1 when ` > 0.\n2. The case \u03b3 6= 0\nIn order to make progress, we posit that \u03b1 and F can be expanded as power series of \u03b3, namely\n\u03b1 = \u03b10 + \u03b11\u03b3 + \u03b12\u03b3 2 + . . .\nF (\u03b8) = F0 + F1(\u03b8)\u03b3 + F2(\u03b8)\u03b3 2 + . . .\nwhere \u03b10 = 2 + 1/nZ is the solution for \u03b3 = 0 and F0 is the constant solution found above. The coefficient \u03b11 must be zero for symmetry reasons.\nInserting this expansion in Eq. (34) and imposing that all Fn(\u00b7) remain \u03c0-periodic, the identification of terms of order \u03b3n finally leads to\n\u03b1 = \u03b10 + \u03b32\n32\n( 4\nnZ \u2212 1 n3Z\n) +O(\u03b34). (35)\nFigure 3 displays the numerical values of \u03b1 as a function of \u03b3 for nZ = 0.4 and nZ = 0.6 in with the corresponding theoretical parabolas, see Eq. (35). Note that the \u03b32 correction changes sign when nZ = 1/2.\nIn this case (nZ = 1/2), finding an exact solution of the associated Schrodinger solution is possible [25], and leads to \u03b1 = 4 for all values of \u03b3.7 The corresponding solution for F is also known in that case and is a constant independent of \u03b8, as can be directly checked from Eq. (34). An expansion around the special point nZ = 1/2 can in fact be performed and leads to first order to\n\u03b1 = 4 + 16\n4 + \u03b32\n( 1\n2 \u2212 nZ\n) + o ( 1\n2 \u2212 nZ\n) .\nFinally, note that the condition \u03b1 > 3 (ensuring that the mean activity is finite) reads, to first order in \u03b3:\nnZ < n ? \u2248 1 + \u03b3\n2\n8 +O(\u03b34). (36)\nThe isotropic case \u03b3 = 0 boils down to the univariate ZHawkes model, for which n? = 1, see [19].\n7 The other exact solutions found in [25] unfortunately correspond to sub-dominant, larger values of \u03b1.\n3. The case nZ \u2212\u2192 +\u221e\nEquation (34) can be easily analysed when nZ \u2212\u2192 +\u221e, in which case \u03b1 tends to the smallest possible value, 2, corresponding to a maximally \u201cfat\u201d distribution. The only periodic solution to Eq. (34) in that limit is\nF\u221e(\u03b8) = C\n2 + \u03b3 sin(2\u03b8) , (37)\nwhere C is a constant. When nZ is very large but not infinite, we posit that the solution writes\nF (\u03b8) = F\u221e(\u03b8) + 1\nn2Z G(\u03b8) +O(\n1\nn4Z ), (38)\ntogether with \u03b1 = 2 + \u03b6/nZ , with G(\u00b7) and \u03b6 to be determined. Inserting Eq. (38) in the ODE on F Eq. (34), one obtains the ODE for G:\n[(2 + \u03b3 sin(2\u03b8))G(\u03b8)] \u2032\u2032 = \u2212C 2\u03b6(\u03b6 \u2212 1) + \u03b3\u03b6 2 sin(2\u03b8)\n2 + \u03b3 sin(2\u03b8) .\n(39) Imposing G(\u00b7) to be \u03c0-periodic, that is imposing that the right hand side of Eq. (39) integrates to zero between \u03b8 = 0 and \u03b8 = \u03c0, sets the value of \u03b6:\n\u03b6 = ( 1\u2212 \u03b3 2\n4\n)\u2212 12 , (40)\nrecovering \u03b6 = 1 when \u03b3 = 0 and the small \u03b3 expansion result above, see Eq. (35). The function G(\u00b7) is plotted in Fig. 4 for \u03b3 = 1.\nWhen comparing the solution above with the histogram of simulated \u03b8 for nZ = 10 and \u03b3 = 1, we find an excellent match with F\u221e, without need of any correction, see Fig. 5. This is expected since the correction term G(\u03b8)/n2Z is of the order of 1% in that\nnumerical solution F found by looking for a solution couple (F, \u03b1) of a positive \u03c0-periodic solution F of Eq. (34) and a value \u03b1. The the dashed line for nZ = 10 and nZ = 0.9 shows the solution F\u221e for \u03b1 = 2 (nZ \u2212\u2192 +\u221e). The upper right figure, obtained for nZ = 10, matches very well the solution obtained when nZ \u2212\u2192 +\u221e since corrections are O(n\u22122Z ). Note\nthat when nZ = 1/2, the exact solution F (\u03b8) is independent of \u03b8 for all values of \u03b3.\ncase. When nZ decreases, corrections become more pronounced. The numerically computed F is in good agreement with the angular distribution obtained from a direct numerical simulation of the two dimensional stochastic process (Eq. (33)).\n4. The case nZ \u2212\u2192 0\nWhen nZ tends to zero, we expect that the exponent \u03b1 of the power-law tail diverges. Looking again for \u03b1 of the form \u03b1 = 2 + \u03b6/nZ , we find that Eq. (34) reads:(\n2\u03b6(\u03b6 \u2212 1) + \u03b62\u03b3 sin(2\u03b8) ) F (\u03b8)\n+ n2Z [(2 + \u03b3 sin(2\u03b8))F (\u03b8)] \u2032\u2032\n= 0. (41)\nWhen nZ \u2212\u2192 0, this equation looks self-contradictory because the remaining term can only be zero if F (\u03b8) = 0. However, the second derivative term is a singular perturbation, so it must be treated with care. The idea is to look for a solution F which is zero nearly everywhere, except very close to some special values of \u03b8 where the second derivative diverges. It turns out that all the action takes place close to \u03b8 = \u03c0/4 when \u03b3 > 0 and \u03b8 = \u2212\u03c0/4 when \u03b3 < 0. Choosing \u03b3 > 0, \u03b8 = \u03c0/4 + u \u221a nZ , and nZ \u2212\u2192 0, Eq. (41) becomes\n12\nthe Schrodinger equation of a harmonic oscillator, up to terms O(n2Z):[ \u2212(2 + \u03b3)d 2\u03a8\ndu2 + 2\u03b62\u03b3u2\u03a8\n] =\n2\u03b6(\u03b6 \u2212 1) + \u03b62\u03b3 nZ \u03a8,\nwith\n\u03a8(u) := F (\u03c0\n4 + u \u221a nZ\n) .\nThe smallest \u03b1 solution (or \u201cground state\u201d) is\n\u03a8(u) = C \u2032e\u2212\u03bau 2 +O(nZ), \u03ba = \u03b6 \u221a \u03b3\n4 + 2\u03b3 , (42)\nwhere C \u2032 is another constant, together with\n\u03b6 = 2\n2 + \u03b3 +\n\u221a 2\u03b3\n2 + \u03b3 nZ +O(n\n2 Z). (43)\nThis solution is only accurate in a region of width \u223c\u221a nZ around \u03c0/4, beyond which it quickly goes to zero. This is in perfect agreement with the numerical solution of Eq. (34) for small nZ , shown in Fig. 6. The parabolic shape in a semi-log plot around \u03b8 = \u03c0/4 agrees with the predictions of Eq. (42). Moreover, the value of \u03b1 = 2+\u03b6/nZ , with \u03b6 given in Eq. (43), also perfectly matches the numerical values reported in Fig. 7. Note that for \u03b3 < 0, the same results hold with |\u03b3| replacing \u03b3 in the above equations.\nE. The General Case\nIn the previous section, we have shown how to compute the power-law tail exponent in the case where only\nthe quadratic \u201cZHawkes\u201d kernel is present. We also restricted to simple cases where the frequencies \u03c9 and coupling constants aZ are symmetric. Although analytically more challenging, the method outlined above can be implemented more generally, and amounts to solving a problem akin to the quantification condition for the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Similarly to the monovariate case, the volatility distribution develops a power-law tail for all values of the Hawkes feedback nH , as long as some amount of Zumbach feedback nZ is present. When nH 6= 0, the equation setting the tail in the bivariate case is a three dimensional partial derivative equation generalizing the equation written in the appendix of Ref. [5]. We expect that even a tiny amount of Zumbach feedback coupled to the standard Hawkes effect brings the exponent \u03b1 into the empirical range, as found in the monovariate case [5].\nIV. CONCLUSION\nLet us summarise what we have achieved in this study. Building on the work of Blanc et al. [5], we extended the Quadratic Hawkes model to a multivariate framework (MQHawkes). We emphasized that in the multivariate case, both idiosyncratic and common jumps must be considered in the general case, leading to a quite complex framework that we only detailed in the bivariate case.\nWe defined the endogeneity ratio of MQHawkes, as well as the associated conditions for the process to be stationary. Within the ZHawkes approximation \u2013 where quadratic kernels write as a sum of a time diagonal component, reproducing a linear Hawkes feedback, and a\n13\nrank one component \u2013 we gave a deeper understanding of the roles of the different feedback terms in the stationarity condition. We found that, in particular, the spectral radius of the Hawkes component needs to be strictly inferior to 1, as for the 1D case. The rank one component contains both exciting and inhibiting realisations and is not involved in the condition, although such a contribution can lead to a divergence of the average intensity of the process, see [19].\nWe further defined the covariance structures for MQHawkes processed and established the associated Yule-Walker equations. The latter allow one to fully determine the quadratic kernels from data, and thereby pave the way for their empirical calibration.\nFinally, we studied the volatility distribution of a 2D MQHawkes process. Restricting our study to ZHawkes without Hawkes (nH = 0), with exponential kernels and in symmetric cases, we were able to characterize exactly the tail of the joint probability density function of the ZHawkes intensity terms. We found that it displays a power law behavior, in line with the observed fat tails of financial returns. Note that, interestingly, the coupling between assets imposes that the exponent \u03b1 is the same for all assets \u2013 a mechanism that may explain the apparent universality of the power-law tail observed in financial markets.\nIn a forthcoming companion paper [8], we shall calibrate the model on empirical data. On the theoretical side, while expected to be quite heavy, it would be interesting to further develop the analysis in the presence of co-jumps and correlations. Note that for the sake of clarity most of our explicit expressions are given in the 2D case. Expanding them further in the N -dimensional case will be necessary in order to calibrate the model on a large number of assets, say a pool of stocks [8].\nAlso, in the present analysis of the volatility distribution, we restricted to symmetric coefficients and exponential kernels. Confirming that our conclusions are qualitatively robust against changes in symmetry and kernel functionnals, and studying its quantitative implications would also be of interest. Furthermore, we have focused on the specific case of the quadratic Hawkes model because of its ability to reproduce multiple financial stylised facts, but it would also be interesting to consider the multivariate generalisation of other nonlinear Hawkes models, following the interesting insights and methods presented in Ref. [26].\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe would like to thank Riccardo Marcaccioli for sharing his work and ideas on detection of jumps in financial data, Natascha Hey and Swann Chelly for fruitful discussions and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Garnier-Brun, Rudy Morel\nand Samy Lakhal for their insights on numerical simulations.\nThis research was conducted within the Econophysics & Complex Systems Research Chair, under the aegis of the Fondation du Risque, the Fondation de l\u2019Ecole polytechnique, the Ecole polytechnique and Capital Fund Management.\n14\n[1] Gatheral J, Jaisson T, Rosenbaum M.

Conditions for Positive QHawkes Intensities\nInspired by the method in [27], we detail here sufficient conditions for the intensity of the process i to be positive, when considering N assets. We first consider the simple case L \u2261 0. First, considering that the kernels are negligible up to a value q, and using a discrete approximation of the integration, we rewrite the intensity associated with asset i:\n\u03bbi,t =\u03bbi,\u221e + N\u2211 j\u2264k \u222b\u222b t \u2212\u221e Kijk(t\u2212 s, t\u2212 u) dP js dP ku ' \u03bbi,\u221e + N\u2211 j\u2264k q\u2211 u=1 q\u2211 s=1 dP jt\u2212uK i jk(s, u)dP k t\u2212s\nSo we can write:\n\u03bbi,t = \u03bbi,\u221e + r > t Kirt\nwhere\nKi =  Ki11(1, 1) . . . K i 11(1, q) . . . 1 2 Ki1N (1, 1) . . . 1 2 Ki1N (1, q) ... . . . ... ... . . . ... Ki11(q, 1) . . . K i 11(q, q) . . . 1 2 Ki1N (q, 1) . . . 1 2 Ki1N (q, q) ... . . . ... 1 2 Ki1N (1, 1) . . . 1 2 Ki1N (1, q) . . . K i NN (1, 1) . . . K i NN (1, q) ... . . . ... ... . . . ...\n1 2 Ki1N (q, 1) . . . 1 2 Ki1N (q, q) . . . K i NN (q, 1) . . . K i NN (q, q)\n , rt =  dP 1t\u22121 ... dP 1t\u2212q ... dPNt\u22121 ...\ndPNt\u2212q\n\nSo Ki is a symmetric blocs matrix where the bloc j of the diagonal is blocjj = K i jj(1, 1) . . . K i jj(1, q) ... . . .\n... Kijj(q, 1) . . . K i jj(q, q)  and the bloc (k, j) when k < j is blockj = 12 K i kj(1, 1) . . . K i kj(1, q) ... . . .\n... Kikj(q, 1) . . . K i kj(q, q)  (when j < k the cross kernels is Kijk). Thus, in this case, where L \u2261 0, sufficient condition to keep the intensity positive is to have Ki positive semi-definite.\nIf we now consider the case where L 6= 0, following the same method, we can write:\n\u03bbi,t = \u03bbi,\u221e + Lirt + r > t Kirt\nwhere rt and Ki are the same as before and Li is\nLi = ( Li1(1) . . . L i 1(q) . . . L i N (1) . . . L i N (q) )> Assuming Ki is invertible, one can complete the square by writing:\n\u03bbi,t =\u03bbi,\u221e + Lirt + r > t Kirt\n=\u03bbi,\u221e + ( rt + 1\n2 K\u22121i Li\n)> Ki ( rt + 1\n2 K\u22121i Li\n) \u2212 1\n4 L>i K\u22121i Li\nIn conclusion, a sufficient condition for intensities to stay positive when L 6= 0 is to have all kernels Ki positive definite and\n\u03bbi,\u221e \u2265 1 4 L>i K\u22121i Li, \u2200i\n17\n3. Stationary Condition in Bivariate Case\nIn the bivariate case, we no longer have E(dP iudP ju) = 0 when i 6= j. Thus, when computing E(\u03bbt) to find the mean intensity and thus the stationary condition, we need to compute the mean of cross feedback.\nWe first introduce m(dt, d\u03be1, d\u03be2) the joint Punctual Poisson Measure associate to the jump processes of the prices (P 1, P 2). So it is a pure jump process with i.i.d jump sizes (\u03be1\u03be2) of common law p on (R,B(R)). We assume\u222b R \u03be1\u03be2p(d\u03be1, d\u03be2) = \u03c81\u03c82.\n1 \u03c81\u03c82 E (\u222b t \u2212\u221e \u222b t \u2212\u221e K12(t\u2212 s, t\u2212 u)dP 1s dP 2u ) = 1 \u03c81\u03c82 E (\u222b t \u2212\u221e K12(t\u2212 u, t\u2212 u)dP 1udP 2u )\n= 1 \u03c81\u03c82 E (\u222b\nR \u222b t \u2212\u221e K12(t\u2212 u, t\u2212 u)s1us2u\u03be1u\u03be2um(du,d\u03be1, d\u03be2) )\n= 1 \u03c81\u03c82 E (\u222b\nR \u222b t \u2212\u221e K12(t\u2212 u, t\u2212 u)s1us2u\u03be1u\u03be2u\u00b5cudup(d\u03be1, d\u03be2) )\n= 1 \u03c81\u03c82 E (\u222b t \u2212\u221e K12(t\u2212 u, t\u2212 u)s1us2u\u00b5cudu ) E (\u222b R \u03be1u\u03be 2 up(d\u03be 1, d\u03be2) )\n= \u222b t \u2212\u221e K12(t\u2212 u, t\u2212 u)E(s1us2u)E(\u00b5cu)du\n= \u03c1\u00b5c \u222b t \u2212\u221e K12(t\u2212 u, t\u2212 u)du\n4. Yule-Walker Equations: Complement\nWe write the Yule-Walker equations for the matrix and one for D\u00d7, the calculations can be made as in Appendix 1 of [5]:\nD\u00d7(\u03c41, \u03c42) = \u222b +\u221e \u03c4+1 Kd(u)D\u00d7(\u03c41 \u2212 u, \u03c42 \u2212 u)du\n+ 2 \u222b +\u221e \u03c4+1 Kd(u, \u03c41) ( D112(u\u2212 \u03c41, \u03c42 \u2212 \u03c41) 0 0 D221(u\u2212 \u03c41, \u03c42 \u2212 \u03c41) ) du\n+ \u222b +\u221e \u03c4+1 K\u00d7(u, \u03c41) ( 0 D211(u\u2212 \u03c41, \u03c42 \u2212 \u03c41) )> du+ \u222b +\u221e \u03c4+1 K\u00d7(\u03c41, u) ( D122(u\u2212 \u03c41, \u03c42 \u2212 \u03c41) 0 )> du\n(A.1)\nIn the bivariate case, we need to consider dNc. Thus, C becomes a 3\u00d73 matrix, and the three-point correlation now also considers the components Dcij . With this in mind, we can calculate the Yule-Walker equation for C in the bivariate case:\nC(\u03c4) = Qd(\u03c4) + \u222b +\u221e\n0\nQd(u, u)C(\u03c4 \u2212 u)du+ 2 \u222b +\u221e\n0\n\u222b +\u221e u+ Qd(\u03c4 + u, \u03c4 + v)Dd(u, v)dvdu\n+ \u222b +\u221e 0 \u222b +\u221e u+ Q\u00d7(\u03c4 + u, \u03c4 + v) D112D212 Dc12 > (u, v)dvdu+ \u222b +\u221e 0 \u222b +\u221e u+ Q\u00d7(\u03c4 + u, \u03c4 + v) D112D212 Dc12 > (u, v)dudv + \u03c1\n\u222b +\u221e 0 Q112Q212 Qc12  (u) Cc1Cc2 Cc3 > (\u03c4 \u2212 u)du+ \u222b +\u221e 0 Q111Q222 Qccc  (u) Cc1Cc2 Cc3 T (\u03c4 \u2212 u)du where is a 2\u00d7 2 matrix defined as\n:= ( \u03bb\u03041 \u00b5\u0304c \u00b5\u0304c \u03bb\u03042 ) .\n18\n5. Asymptotic Behavior of Decaying Power Law Kernels\na. Asymptotic Forms\nWe consider decaying power law kernels, such that:\nKd(\u03c4) \u223c \u03c4\u2212\u2192+\u221e\n( kd1\u03c4 \u22121\u2212 d k12\u03c4 \u22121\u2212 o\nk21\u03c4 \u22121\u2212 o kd2\u03c4 \u22121\u2212 d\n) Kd(\u03c4v1, \u03c4v2) \u223c\n\u03c4\u2212\u2192+\u221e\n( K\u030311(v1, v2)\u03c4 \u22122\u03c1d K\u030312(v1, v2)\u03c4 \u22122\u03c1o\nK\u030321(v1, v2)\u03c4 \u22122\u03c1o K\u030322(v1, v2)\u03c4 \u22122\u03c1d\n)\nK\u00d7(\u03c4) \u223c \u03c4\u2212\u2192+\u221e\n( kx1\u03c4 \u22121\u2212 \u00d7\nkx2\u03c4 \u22121\u2212 \u00d7\n) K\u00d7(\u03c4v1, \u03c4v2) \u223c\n\u03c4\u2212\u2192+\u221e\n( K\u0303112(v1, v2)\u03c4 \u22122\u03c1\u00d7\nK\u0303212(v1, v2)\u03c4 \u22122\u03c1\u00d7 ) Where K\u030311, K\u030312, K\u030321, K\u030322, K\u0303112 and K\u0303212 are bounded. Given the Yule-Walker equations of Section II B, we expect the correlation structure to have a similar form. So we look for them as decaying power law functions with parameters defined such as:\nC(\u03c4) \u223c \u03c4\u2212\u2192+\u221e\n( cd1\u03c4 \u2212\u03b2d c12\u03c4 \u2212\u03b2o\nc21\u03c4 \u2212\u03b2o cd2\u03c4 \u2212\u03b2d\n) Dd(\u03c4v1, \u03c4v2) \u223c\n\u03c4\u2212\u2192+\u221e ( D\u0303111(v1, v2)\u03c4\u22122\u03b4d D\u0303122(v1, v2)\u03c4\u22122\u03b4o D\u0303211(v1, v2)\u03c4\u22122\u03b4o D\u0303222(v1, v2)\u03c4\u22122\u03b4d )\nD\u00d7(\u03c4) \u223c \u03c4\u2212\u2192+\u221e\n( d112\u03c4 \u2212\u03b2\u00d7d d121\u03c4 \u2212\u03b2\u00d7o\nd212\u03c4 \u2212\u03b2\u00d7o d221\u03c4 \u2212\u03b2\u00d7d\n) D\u00d7(\u03c4v1, \u03c4v2) \u223c\n\u03c4\u2212\u2192+\u221e ( D\u0303112(v1, v2)\u03c4\u22122\u03b4\u00d7 D\u0303121(v1, v2)\u03c4\u22122\u03b4\u00d7 D\u0303212(v1, v2)\u03c4\u22122\u03b4\u00d7 D\u0303221(v1, v2)\u03c4\u22122\u03b4\u00d7 ) As in [5], we make the following hypothesis on the exponents: \u03c1d > 12 , \u03c1o > 1 2 , \u03c1\u00d7 > 12 , so the first and second moments\nare finite. Moreover, we focus on the cases: \u2022 Non critical case (nH < 1), where we assume 0 < d < 1, 0 < o < 1, \u2022 Critical case (nH = 1), where we assume 0 < d < 12 , 0 < o < 1 2 ,\nIn the non-critical case (n < 1), the method consists in replacing Kd, K\u00d7, C, Dd and D\u00d7 by their asymptotic expressions presented above in the Yule-Walker equations (Eq. (20), Eq. (23) and Eq. (A.1)) and study the limit \u03c4 \u2212\u2192 +\u221e.\nIn the following, we describe the method to find the relationship between the exponents of the correlation structures and the exponents of the kernels in the critical case. In a next section, we give the resulting relationships for both the critical and non critical case.\nb. Method for the Asymptotic Study in the Critical Case of QHawkes process\nIn critical case, when nH = 1, the relationship between auto-correlation structures exponents and kernel exponents can not be determined by looking at the limit \u03c4 \u2192 +\u221e. Thus, to overcome this difficulty, we use a second method to investigate asymptotic behavior using Fourier-domain.\nThis method for the linear Hawkes can be found in [23]. We present it now for the quadratic Hawkes process. For the sake of simplicity we limit ourselves to the 1D case here, the multivariate case can be worked out similarly.\nThe definitions of the autocorrelation structures in the 1D case can be found in [5] and are substantially similar to those used here.\nWe define the Fourier transform of a function f such as:\nf\u0302(\u03c9) = \u222b R f(t)e\u2212i\u03c9tdt\nStep 1: Find the regularity of the Yule-Walker terms: As for the linear case, we start from the Yule-Walker equation on C for \u03c4 6= 0 (see equation (9) in [5]):\nC(\u03c4) = K(\u03c4)\u03bb\u0304+ \u222b +\u221e\n0\nK(\u03c4 \u2212 u)C(u)du+ 2 \u222b +\u221e\n0+ \u222b +\u221e u+ K(\u03c4 + u, \u03c4 + r)D(u, r)drdu, (A.2)\nand its extension in 0 in Fourier domain gives: C\u0302\u2217(\u03c9) = \u03bb\u0304+ C\u0302(\u03c9). (A.3)\n19\nTo use the Fourier transform, we need to extend K and D for \u03c4, \u03c41, \u03c42 < 0. Thus, we consider the function K defined on R with K(\u03c4) = 0 for \u03c4 < 0 similarly for D. Thus, we expect to have K\u0302(\u03c9) and D\u0302(\u03c9) regular in the half plan Im(\u03c9) < 0.\nThe 2 first terms of Eq. (A.2) are the same as in the Yule-Walker equation for the linear case. Hence, the regularity arguments are the same as in [23].\nHowever, we need to study the last term of Eq.

Then, switching integration order and using Chasles relation we obtain:\nC\u03023(\u03c9) =2 \u222b +\u221e 0 \u222b +\u221e u+ \u222b \u2212u \u2212\u221e e\u2212i\u03c9R\u03c4e\u03c9I\u03c4K(\u03c4 + u, \u03c4 + r)D(u, r)d\u03c4drdu } C\u030231(\u03c9)\n+ 2 \u222b +\u221e 0 \u222b +\u221e u+ \u222b 0 \u2212u e\u2212i\u03c9R\u03c4e\u03c9I\u03c4K(\u03c4 + u, \u03c4 + r)D(u, r)d\u03c4drdu } C\u030232(\u03c9)\n+ 2 \u222b +\u221e 0 \u222b +\u221e u+ \u222b +\u221e 0 e\u2212i\u03c9R\u03c4e\u03c9I\u03c4K(\u03c4 + u, \u03c4 + r)D(u, r)d\u03c4drdu } C\u030233(\u03c9)\nWe study each term C\u030231 , C\u030232 and C\u030233 separately. We first have:\nC\u030231(\u03c9) = 2 \u222b +\u221e 0 \u222b +\u221e u+ \u222b \u2212u \u2212\u221e e\u2212i\u03c9R\u03c4e\u03c9I\u03c4K(\u03c4 + u, \u03c4 + r)D(u, r)d\u03c4drdu\nHere \u03c4 < \u2212u so \u03c4 + u < 0, so K(\u03c4 + u, \u03c4 + r) = 0, so C\u030231(\u03c9) = 0.\nFor the second term, we switch integration order, and we obtain:\nC\u030232(\u03c9) = 2 \u222b 0 \u2212\u221e \u222b +\u221e \u2212\u03c4 \u222b +\u221e u+ e\u2212i\u03c9R\u03c4e\u03c9I\u03c4K(\u03c4 + u, \u03c4 + r)D(u, r)drdud\u03c4\nIn this case, we have \u03c4 \u2265 \u2212u, so \u03c4 + u \u2265 0, and r \u2265 u+ \u2265 \u2212\u03c4 , so K(\u03c4 + u, \u03c4 + r) > 0. We are only interested in \u03c4 \u2212\u2192 \u2212\u221e, so C\u030232(\u03c9) is regular in the half plan \u03c9I > 0.\nFor C\u030233(\u03c9), we have \u03c4 + u > 0 and \u03c4 + r > 0, so K(\u03c4 + u, \u03c4 + r) \u2265 0. Since we are only worried about \u03c4 \u2212\u2192 +\u221e. C\u030233(\u03c9) is regular in half plan \u03c9I < 0.\nWith those results, we now introduce the Yule-Walker equation A.2 in Fourier domain and, as in [23], the function B\u0302:{ C\u0302(\u03c9) = K\u0302(\u03c9)D + K\u0302(\u03c9)C\u0302(\u03c9) + C\u030232(\u03c9) + C\u030233(\u03c9) B\u0302(\u03c9) = K\u0302(\u03c9)D + K\u0302(\u03c9)C\u0302(\u03c9) + C\u030232(\u03c9) + C\u030233(\u03c9)\u2212 C\u0302\u2217(\u03c9) (A.4)\nThus, C\u0302(\u03c9) = (1\u2212 K\u0302(\u03c9))\u22121(K\u0302(\u03c9)D \u2212 B\u0302(\u03c9) + C\u030232(\u03c9) + C\u030233(\u03c9)) (A.5)\nSince C is even, we have (C\u0302>(\u03c9) = C\u0302(\u2212\u03c9)) and Eq.

The exponent \u03b4d = \u03c1d can take 2 values:\n1. \u03b4d = \u03c1d 2. \u03b4d = 2\u03c1\u00d7 + \u03b4o \u2212 12 From empirical observations, we see that it makes sense if the diagonal terms persist longer in time than the non diagonal\nterms. Hence, we expect \u03b4d < \u03b4o. Considering this hypothesis, we would only keep the first case, \u03b4d = \u03c1d < \u03c1o. For the time diagonal exponent (\u03b2d,\u03b2o,\u03b2\u00d7d , \u03b2 \u00d7 o ), we need to make a difference between the non critical case (nH < 1), and the critical case (nH = 1). We call = min( d, o) and \u03c1 = 12 min(\u03b4d + \u03c1d, \u03b4o + \u03c1o, \u03b4d + \u03c1o, \u03b4o + \u03c1d, \u03b4\u00d7 + \u03c1\u00d7) = 1 2 min(\u03c1d + \u03c1o, 2\u03c1o, 2\u03c12, \u03b4\u00d7 + \u03c1\u00d7).\n22\n7. Computation of the Infinitesimal Generator\nWe consider the processes, introducing a time scale T > 0 that will eventually diverge, we define the processes h\u0304T1 (t) = h1(tT ) ,h\u0304T2 (t) = h2(tT ), z\u0304T1 (t) = z1(tT ) and z\u0304T2 (t) = z2(tT ), N\u03041Tt = N1tT , N\u03042Tt = N2tT with the parameters (\u03b21T , \u03b22T ) and (\u03c91T , \u03c92T ) that may depend on T . In the decaying exponential case, we have\n d(h1)t = \u03b21(\u2212(h1)tdt+ dN1t ) d(h2)t = \u03b22(\u2212(h2)tdt+ dN2t ) d(z1)t = \u2212\u03c91(z1)tdt+ \u03c91dP 1t d(z2)t = \u2212\u03c92(z2)tdt+ \u03c92dP 2t =\u21d2  d(h\u0304T1 )t = \u2212\u03b21T ((h\u0304T1 )tTdt+ nHdN1Tt ) d(h\u0304T2 )t = \u2212\u03b22T ((h\u0304T2 )tTdt+ nHdN2Tt ) d(z\u0304T1 )t = \u2212\u03c91T (z\u0304T1 )tTdt+ \u03c91TdP 1Tt d(z\u0304T2 )t = \u2212\u03c92T (z\u0304T2 )tTdt+ \u03c92TdP 2Tt\nThe intensity of, respectively, the first and second process are given by T [\u03bb1\u221e+n1H,1h\u0304T1 +n1H,2h\u0304T2 +(a1Z,1z\u0304T1 )2 +(a1Z,2z\u0304T2 )2 + a1Z,\u00d7z\u0304 T 1 z\u0304 T 2 ] and T [\u03bb2\u221e+n2H,1h\u0304T1 +n2H,2h\u0304T2 + (a2Z,1z\u0304T1 )2 + (a2Z,2z\u0304T2 )2 + a2Z,\u00d7z\u0304 T 1 z\u0304 T 2 ]. Moreover, the price processes can either go up or down with same probability 1 2 .\nThus, the infinitesimal generator can be written using Theorem 1.22 of Oksendal and Sulem:\n23\nAfT (h1, h2, z1, z2) =\u2212 T\u03b21Th1\u2202h1f \u2212 T\u03b22Th2\u2202h2f \u2212 \u03c91TTz1\u2202z1f \u2212 \u03c92TTz2\u2202z2f\n+ T [\u03bb1\u221e + n 1 H,1h1 + n 1 H,2h2 + (a 1 Z,1z1) 2 + (a1Z,2z2) 2 + a1Z,\u00d7z2z1] ( 1 2 f(h1 + \u03b2T1, h2, z1 + \u03c91T , z2) + 1 2 f(h1 + \u03b2T1, h2, z1 \u2212 \u03c91T , z2)\u2212 f(h1, h2, z1, z2)\n) + T [\u03bb2\u221e + n 2 H,1h1 + n 2 H,2h2 + (a 2 Z,1z1) 2 + (a2Z,2z2) 2 + a2Z,\u00d7z2z1]\n( 1 2 f(h1, h2 + \u03b2T2, z1, z2 \u2212 \u03c92T ) + 1 2 f(h1, h2 + \u03b2T2, z1, z2 + \u03c92T )\u2212 f(h1, h2, z1, z2)\n) As in [5], we use the scaling \u03b21T = \u03b2\u03041T , \u03b22T = \u03b2\u03042 T , \u03c91T = \u03c9\u03041T , \u03c92T = \u03c9\u03042 T\nand the Taylor development when T \u2192 +\u221e which result in:\nAfT (h1, h2, z1, z2) =\u2212 \u03b2\u03041h1\u2202h1f \u2212 \u03b2\u03042h2\u2202h2f \u2212 \u03c9\u03041z1\u2202z1f \u2212 \u03c9\u03042z2\u2202z2f\n+ T [\u03bb1\u221e + n 1 H,1h1 + n 1 H,2h2 + (a 1 Z,1z1) 2 + (a1Z,2z2) 2 + a1Z,\u00d7z2z1] ( \u03b2\u03041 T \u2202h1f + (\u03c9\u03041) 2 2T \u22022z1z1f + o( 1 T ) )\n+ T [\u03bb2\u221e + n 2 H,1h1 + n 2 H,2h2 + (a 2 Z,1z1) 2 + (a2Z,2z2) 2 + a2Z,\u00d7z2z1] ( \u03b2\u03042 T \u2202h2f + (\u03c9\u03042) 2 2T \u22022z2z2f + o( 1 T ) )\nThus, the infinitesimal generator is given by:\nAf\u221e(h1, h2, z1, z2) =\u2212 \u03b2\u03041h1\u2202h1f \u2212 \u03b2\u03042h2\u2202h2f \u2212 \u03c9\u03041z1\u2202z1f \u2212 \u03c9\u03042z2\u2202z2f\n+ [\u03bb1\u221e + n 1 H,1h1 + n 1 H,2h2 + (a 1 Z,1z1) 2 + (a1Z,2z2) 2 + a1Z,\u00d7z2z1] ( nH \u03b2\u03041\u2202h1f + (\u03c9\u03041) 2\n2 \u22022z1z1f ) + [\u03bb2\u221e + n 2 H,1h1 + n 2 H,2h2 + (a 2 Z,1z1) 2 + (a2Z,2z2) 2 + a2Z,\u00d7z2z1] ( nH \u03b2\u03042\u2202h2f + (\u03c9\u03042) 2\n2 \u22022z2z2f ) One can also include co-jumps, which would change the coefficients above and add a term of the form \u03c1\u22022z1z2f , where \u03c1 is the correlation between the Poisson processes driving 1 and 2.\nWhen considering only ZHawkes without Hawkes (nH = 0), we have h1 = h2 = 0, thus the infinitesimal generator results in:\nAf\u221e(z1, z2) =\u2212 \u03c9\u03041z1\u2202z1f \u2212 \u03c9\u03042z2\u2202z2f\n+ [\u03bb1\u221e + (a 1 Z,1z1) 2 + (a1Z,2z2) 2 + a1Z,\u00d7z2z1]\n(\u03c9\u03041) 2\n2 \u22022z1z1f + [\u03bb 2 \u221e + (a 2 Z,1z1) 2 + (a2Z,2z2) 2 + a2Z,\u00d7z2z1]\n(\u03c9\u03042) 2\n2 \u22022z2z2f\n8.
