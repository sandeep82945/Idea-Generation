Many studies have shown that the pandemic has negative effects on the mental health of individuals. Determining the factors that play a role in the psychological resilience and burnout levels of healthcare workers, who are at the forefront of the pandemic, will play an important role in preventive and therapeutic planning in pandemic management. Our aim is to evaluate the anxietyburnout levels and psychological resilience levels in healthcare workers and the factors affecting them. Method:Sociodemographic data form, State-Trait Anxiety Scale (STAI), Connor-Davidson Psychological Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) and Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), were created in Google Documents and applied to the Healthcare workers via mail and message groups and social media groups. A total of 257 people were included in the study. Results: In our study, high trait anxiety scores and increased working were associated with increased levels of burnout. Doctors and nurses showed more signs of burnout than auxiliary assistant staff. The emotional exhaustion and personal accomplishment were higher in females. Psychological resilience could predict personal accomplishment sub-dimension and total scores of MBI. Conclusions: Healthcare workers are at risk for burnout. Working conditions should be regulated and psychosocial support programs should be established for healthcare workers who are at the forefront in pandemic.",

Derg. 2022; 13 (1): 57-66\nThe new type of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019, spre-ad rapidly in a short time and affected the whole world. While COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 is seen as an upper respiratory tract infection with asymptomatic or mild symptoms in general, viral pneumonia may cause severe clinical manifestations that progress to acute respiratory failure in some cases. Depending on the clinical condition of the patients, outpatient or inpatient treatment may be required. The rapid spread of the virus, the variety of symptoms, and the absence of a definitive treatment have caused excessive intensity and burden in the health system.\nAlthough the prevalence of COVID-19 among healthcare workers varies in different countries, it constitutes a significant proportion of those affected. According to some reports, 10% of confirmed COVID-19 cases involved healthcare providers(1). Healthcare workers\u2019 burden continues to increase due to the pandemic and the overload in the health system. Healthcare workers found themselves working at the vanguard of responding to the COVID-19 pandemic and exposed to various risks to their psychological and physical health (2).\nThe fatal and uncontrollable nature of COVID-19, with no known effective cure, is coupled with a relatively high infection rate and mortality among healthcare providers. Separation from the family, the risk of transmitting the virus to family members, mental and physical fatigue caused by excessive working hours, problems in accessing protective equipment and medical supplies, working in a field outside of their specialties have provoked feelings of anxiety and stress on healthcare workers than ever before (3).\nBurnout is a psychological condition that is defined as a psychological, emotional, and physical stress state in response to prolonged exposure to occupational stress (4). Maslach et al described three subtitles of burnout as; emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and decreased professional success (4). Emotional exhaustion represents the primary dimension of personal stress, the depletion of emotional resources required to communicate with other people. Desensitization represents the interpersonal context dimension of burnout. It refers to developing negative feelings and cynical attitudes towards the person to whom the person provides service or care. The individual skills-achievement reduction component is the selfassessment dimension of burnout and refers to feelings\nof inadequacy and lack of success and productivity at work(5).\nBurnout can have severe outcomes for both patients and healthcare workers. It can cause dreadful physical and mental health consequences and reduce the quality of service provided by affected staff. Various systematic reviews in the literature have found that high burnout in healthcare workers is associated with less safe patient care (6,7).\nRecognizing the anxiety and burnout levels of healthcare professionals can contribute to planning preventive mental health services and providing mental well-being for healthcare workers. Therefore, we aimed to determine the anxiety and burnout levels in healthcare workers of the COVID-19 pandemic in a pandemic hospital in Turkey and reveal the potential protective and risk factors."

            "text": "In this cross-sectional study, we evaluated healthcare workers\u2019 burnout levels in the COVID-19 pandemic and revealed the factors that may affect burnout. We found that higher trait anxiety, working as a nurse or doctor, increased years of education and excessive weekly working hours are associated with increased burnout levels.\nCOVID-19 pandemic impacts the physical and psychological health of healthcare workers worldwide (14). Not surprisingly, it creates unprecedented challenges for healthcare professionals. Previous research on burnout has shown that the highest burnout rate is observed among hospital emergency departments (15). In the event of a pandemic that caused a crisis in healthcare provision, all healthcare workers tried to overcome this crisis by acting in collaboration. However, as the pandemic period extends, the burnout of healthcare workers is expected to increase.\nOur findings reinforce the multidimensionality of burnout. The total and three dimensions of burnout are related to a set of variables. It can be thought that these three sub-dimensions may be necessary for terms of considering the future burnout prevention program.\nWe have determined that female gender, marital status, parental status, working status in the COVID-19 clinics, excessive working hours, and living alone may contribute to burnout.\nAc\u0131badem Univ. Sa\u011fl\u0131k Bilim. Derg. 2022; 13 (1): 57-66\nAc\u0131badem Univ. Sa\u011fl\u0131k Bilim. Derg. 2022; 13 (1): 57-66\nAc\u0131badem Univ. Sa\u011fl\u0131k Bilim. Derg. 2022; 13 (1): 57-66\nAlthough there were findings in previous studies that being married and having a child could increase burnout (16,17), Burnout scores were lower in those married and had children in our study. This can be explained by reducing the workload outside the hospital with the spouse\u2019s support in married couples. It has been shown that having a child significantly reduces the depersonalization subscale values in our study. By increasing the healthcare worker\u2019s empathy, having children decreases the depersonalization towards the patients in business life. Also, total burnout scores of those living alone were found to be higher. It can be thought that with social isolation, the loneliness of the healthcare workers can increase burnout.\nOur study showed that working in the COVID-19 clinics increased all three dimensions of burnout. In a study conducted in China, burnout prevalence was high among frontline nurses (18). Another study in Switzerland showed a higher level of burnout in the group of healthcare workers who have direct contact with patients (19). In addition to the increase in healthcare workers\u2019 workload, the risk of being infected, increasing number of patients, increased disease severity, uncertainty in treatments, critical decision-making processes, the possibility of carrying the pathogen to their family was expected to increase burnout of healthcare workers.\nAc\u0131badem Univ. Sa\u011fl\u0131k Bilim. Derg. 2022; 13 (1): 57-66\nA previous study conducted with healthcare professionals in Italy showed that weekly working hours predicted three MBI sub-dimensions (20). In our study, both state anxiety and total burnout scores were higher in the group with excessive weekly working hours. Physical and mental fatigue and excessive working hours increased their anxiety and ultimately increased emotional exhaustion and depersonalization sub-dimensions.\nA significant positive correlation was found in our study between the duration of education (years) and the emotionally exhausting and depersonalization sub-dimension. It has also been shown that it can predict emotional exhausting sub-dimension and total MBI score. As the years of education increase, the role and responsibilities of individuals in critical decision-making processes increase. It can be thought that this may contribute to mental fatigue and burnout.\nWhen we examined the burnout sub-dimensions and total scores according to professional status in our study, we found that doctors were affected more than assistant staff in the depersonalization and personal accomplishment sub-dimensions. In terms of emotionally exhausting and total MBI score, we found that doctors and nurses were affected more than assistant staff. In addition to previous studies showing that nurses are at higher risk for burnout (20,21), in a study by Jalili et al., residents are at higher risk than nurses (23). Working as a doctor was found as a predictor in the depersonalization and personal accomplishment sub-dimensions in our study. Here, it can be thought that the uncertainty in COVID-19 treatment and the variability in response to treatment and prognosis may be compelling.\nResilience is defined as the power to cope with risk, trouble, and stress, even though an individual is subjected to a severe strain that can lead to various physical, behavioral, cognitive, and emotional symptoms (24,25). Studies have shown that there tend to be lower resistance rates to infectious disease outbreaks (26). It also suggests that those affected by deterrent events may, over time, overcome adversity and become resilient (27). The traumatic experience created by the pandemic is continuing on society and healthcare workers. In our study, we showed that resilience could predict personal accomplishment sub-dimension and total scores of MBI. We consider it a potentially protective factor against burnout, as shown in previous studies (16,28).\nWhile anxiety can be protective for people at a certain level and time, it becomes harmful by disrupting functionality as its severity and duration increase. COVID-19 pandemic period can be assumed as an example of this. The uncertainty in the treatment and the pandemic\u2019s prolongation laid the groundwork for the potentially harmful effects of anxiety.\nLimited data are available regarding the mental consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare workers with a history of psychiatric disorders. In a study conducted in Australia, it has been shown that those with psychiatric disorders in the past are associated with anxiety, depression, and burnout (29). In our study, consistent with the above study, the STAI-T, STAI-S, and total MBI scores were higher in the group with a history of psychiatric disorders.\nAccording to Spielberger, anxiety is divided into trait anxiety and state anxiety. Trait anxiety is the sensitivity of a person to anxiety, that is, the level of perceiving stressful situations as threats, and state anxiety is the response given after being regarded as threatening to a situation (30).\nIn our study, trait anxiety-related to anxiety sensitivity was higher in women, individuals living alone, nurses (according to health staff ), and those with a history of psychiatric disorders. It was also shown in the regression analysis that it could predict total MBI and its three subdimensions. State anxiety was higher in women, nurses (according to health staff ), those with a history of psychiatric disorders, and those whose weekly working hours increased. It has been shown that state anxiety predicts emotional exhaustion.\nIndividuals with high trait anxiety levels are more likely to experience state anxiety than those with low trait anxiety (in terms of intensity, frequency, duration) (31). In our study, there is a positive high-degree correlation between the trait and state anxiety. We can say that trait anxiety, which is related to the level of anxiety sensitivity determined by biological, environmental, and other factors, is more critical for burnout than state anxiety. However, the continuation of the pandemic and the prolongation of uncertainty causes the anxiety levels to continue increasing. As a result, the emergence of dysfunction and psychiatric disorders will be inevitable."

Firstly, the participants were evaluated cross-sectionally. In hospitals, depending on the pandemic pace, patient density and workload are different. This can affect burnout levels and resilience. In future studies, longer follow-ups evaluating the relationship between state anxiety changes and burnout and resilience can be planned. Secondly, in our study, people who are not interested in internet applications may have been excluded from the sample because the surveys were conducted online. However, in the COVID-19 pandemic, many studies have been conducted online, as face-to-face interviews are risky for the infection."
