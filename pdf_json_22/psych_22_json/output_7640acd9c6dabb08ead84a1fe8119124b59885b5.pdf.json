Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez et al. (2021) argue that the pandemic will have a persistently negative effect on investment, jobs, schooling, and international trade. Furthermore, in the context of the slow global economic recovery in 2021, new COVID-19 strains such as the Delta variant have added to the economic strain. According to the International Labor Organization, 8.8% of global work time was lost in 2020, equivalent to 255 million full-time jobs. In particular, young people aged 15\u201324 were among the most severely affected, with an unemployment rate of 8.7%. College graduates are members of the group most affected by the pandemic and the damage caused will expose them to employment difficulties in the future, which will, thus, affect the normal order of society. However, there are always two sides to the coin. While negatively impacting society and the economy, the changes brought about by the pandemic may be beneficial to certain types of businesses. Moreover, the high level of uncertainty it creates and the subsequent elevation of new, urgent needs present unique entrepreneurial opportunities, which provide room for the creation and growth of many new businesses in various sectors. For example, online education, home entertainment, telemedicine, e-commerce, medical devices, and other industries all flourished during the pandemic (Bacq and Lumpkin, 2021; Lungu et al., 2021; Zahra, 2021). Overall, the pandemic had a more lasting impact on people\u2019s values, jobs, lifestyles, and mindsets, in addition to their health (Davidsson et al., 2021). For college students, the restrictions on\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 1 March 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 870705\ngathering, social distance, and travel affected their studies, make them more educated online, while the impact on employers indirectly affected their regular employment. Furthermore, traditional employment channels have changed, with students\u2019 preferences moving from large corporations or government departments to start-ups and entrepreneurship (Akkermans et al., 2020; Ratten and Jones, 2021). Various studies found that, by creating, expanding, and substituting demand, the pandemic environment created a wealth of entrepreneurial opportunities and motivated people to replace regular employment with entrepreneurship (Maritz et al., 2020; Alvarez-Risco et al., 2021), which creates rich preconditions for entrepreneurship among college students. Moreover, when an individual perceives an entrepreneurial opportunity, they may favor the option of starting a business (Karimi et al., 2016).\nAlvarez-Risco et al. (2021) argue that promoting entrepreneurial activities can help to combat the crisis brought about by the pandemic. Therefore, with the urgent need to restart the economy, whether students are willing to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the pandemic regarding entrepreneurship and successfully guiding them to take full advantage of these opportunities and, thus, contribute to the maintenance of social order and the enhancement of economic vitality is a question worthy of our attention. Based on event system theory, regulatory focus theory (RFT), and affect-as-information theory, this article analyzes the impact of COVID-19 on college students\u2019 regulatory focus and fear of failure and then discusses its role on college students\u2019 willingness to start their own businesses. Based on event system theory, for the role of the pandemic as an external factor, this article introduces the attribute of event strength to measure the impact of the event on the entity (Morgeson et al., 2015), i.e., to analyze the direct and indirect effects of the strength of the pandemic event on college students\u2019 regulatory focus, fear of failure, and entrepreneurial intentions. RFT suggests that individuals possess two self-regulatory systems, promotion and prevention, which explain their behavioral motivations in depth; this theory was later applied in the field of entrepreneurship to provide a stronger explanation for entrepreneurial intentions (Higgins, 1997). In addition, affect-as-information theory suggests that an individual\u2019s response to a specific event in the external environment is expressed as emotions, while negative emotions arising from the potential threat of failure in entrepreneurship are reflected in the fear of failure (Welpe et al., 2012). When individuals perceive the possibility of failure, changes in their behavior may follow (Urbano et al., 2016). As people increasingly form experiences about pandemics through pandemic-related information, the infectiousness of the emotions and the perceived fear associated with such crises may influence their intentions and even their behaviors (Ratten and Jones, 2021). In turn, fear of failure is an inherent part of the entrepreneurial journey, a product of the experience of entrepreneurs or potential entrepreneurs in ambiguous entrepreneurial context, and is key to explaining individuals\u2019 choice to start a business or not (Morgan and Sisak, 2015; Cacciotti et al., 2020). Therefore, the fear of failure can be used as a bridge to explore the impact of the pandemic on the entrepreneurial intentions of college\nstudents. In summary, this article integrates event system theory, RFT, and affect-as-information theory to investigate the effect of event strength of COVID-19 pandemic on college students\u2019 entrepreneurial intentions, alongside the mediating roles played by promotion regulatory focus and fear of failure and prevention regulatory focus and fear of failure, respectively, in order to enrich the relevant theoretical research and provide a framework for college students\u2019 entrepreneurship during COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 eras.\nThe article will proceed as follows. First, we present six hypotheses based on a brief review of the literature related to event strength, regulatory focus, fear of failure, and entrepreneurial intentions. These relate to the effects of event strength on entrepreneurial intentions, the mediating role of fear of failure, and prevention and promotion regulatory focus on the relationship between them. We then describe the data collection, study measures, and sample characteristics of the data recovered. Finally, we report the empirical findings and describe the implications of this study."

            "text": "Entrepreneurial Intentions Event system theory dynamically examines the impact of events themselves and their attributes on individuals and organizations and mostly discusses them in three dimensions: strength, time, and space, where the event strength attributes include novelty, criticality, and disruptiveness (Morgeson et al., 2015). When considering the impact of an event on an entity, the effects of the three attributes need to be considered comprehensively. When the strength of an event is certain, the event that occurs at a time that meets the needs of the entity (timing) and continues (duration), originates at a higher level (origin), has a wider ripple effect (horizontal spread range), involves more levels (vertical spread range), and is closer to the entity (distance from the entity) is more likely to have an impact on the entity or to have a higher degree of impact. COVID-19 epidemic is a passive event and as of April 6, 2020, there are more than 131.4 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, which still continues to grow. In terms of time attributes, the event is detrimental to the development of the entity and has a higher negative impact. In terms of space attributes, the epidemic has swept the globe since its outbreak, without exception and there is no difference in the relationship between entities and the event. Therefore, when discussing the impact of COVID-19 epidemic on entities, the impact of differences in the perceived intensity of entities is mainly examined.\nFor college students, entrepreneurship is often motivated by personal pursuits, interest, and attitudes toward entrepreneurship and policy support for entrepreneurship is also an incentive for them to choose entrepreneurship as a career (Mensah et al., 2021). However, the economic recession\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 March 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 870705\nand recovery and the rise of some industries triggered by the unexpected event of COVID-19 have created more uncertainty about their career choices. Peter Drucker proposed that there are seven main sources of opportunity and the top two are unexpected success and unexpected failure, which means that opportunities mainly come from accidents. The massive outbreak of COVID-19 was clearly unexpected, causing a huge impact on all the industries while also disrupting the current business model and companies and individuals are in dire need of transformation under the crisis. The problem of rising unemployment caused by the spread of the pandemic is serious and encouraging young people to engage in entrepreneurship can reduce unemployment, promote the country\u2019s economic development, and make the country and society more aware of the value of entrepreneurship, thus to provide more support for college students to start their own businesses such as supportive policies and entrepreneurship education (Lopes et al., 2021; Zhang and Huang, 2021; Zulfiqar et al., 2021). Except that, after several months of development, despite the slowdown in economic growth and the serious downward trend in some countries, we found that the non-contact economy is developing rapidly, for instance, online education, internet healthcare, and livestream shopping have achieved remarkable results, which to a certain extent show that the epidemic has given rise to entrepreneurial opportunities. At the same time, the epidemic also brings new problems to people\u2019s working life such as daily protection, sterilization, transportation, and commuting. When individuals expand measures to solve the problems they face and help others to solve similar problems, they then develop into new businesses, i.e., user start-ups. Thus, we believe that the epidemic contains entrepreneurial opportunities that some individuals can identify and act upon. Economical factors can influence entrepreneurial intentions (Devece et al., 2016) and in a recession, there is a need to encourage the creation of new ventures by promoting identification and exploitation of entrepreneurial opportunities, thus stimulating economic dynamism (Ruiz-Rosa et al., 2020). The reduction in employment opportunities during the crisis reduces people\u2019s access to income, thereby reducing the opportunity cost of creating new ventures and giving people greater incentive to use entrepreneurship as an alternative to being employed (Sim\u00f3n-Moya et al., 2016). At the same time, related research found that by creating, expanding, and replacing demand, COVID-19 is creating a wealth of entrepreneurial opportunities (Maritz et al., 2020), thereby creating rich prerequisites for college students to start their own businesses. When an individual perceives an entrepreneurial opportunity, he or she may choose to create a business (Karimi et al., 2016). In addition, the pandemic negatively affects small- and medium-sized enterprises, causing massive unemployment (Ratten and Jones, 2021). This may put considerable pressure on college students, especially those who are about to graduate, to find employment. Thus, for college students, the employment pressure and entrepreneurial opportunities created by COVID-19 pandemic may enhance their willingness to start their own businesses. Accordingly, we hypothesize that:\nH1: The event strength of COVID-19 is positively associated with college students\u2019 entrepreneurial intentions."

            "text": "Fear of failure involves the fearful emotions caused by an individual\u2019s perceived expectation of environmental threats to the achievement of his or her goals. When COVID-19 arrived, there was a general lack of awareness, the anxiety and fear among the public was spreaded, while the number of infections and deaths reported each day increased. Especially, during home isolation, individual college students were separated from the group and had more time to spend alone or with their families. The way people live and learn has changed dramatically, from face-toface to online, and the spatial isolation makes people doubt the authenticity and richness of information, their psychological resources were severely depleted, their sense of control over the outside world and themselves were weaken, and generally lack a sense of security. They are still cautiously exposed even after the resumption of work and business and their daily life is gradually restored to order. After experiencing this epidemic, college students have a deep understanding of the uncertainty of the environment and are more uncertain about their future career development planning, showing a tendency to avoid it. College students are in the transition stage from school to society, full of confusion about their future, and fear increases when they actually feel the hardship of survival. According to the World Economic Outlook released by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the outlook for global growth remains highly uncertain and will depend largely on developments in the epidemic and the effectiveness of policy actions in 2021. Even in China, which is showing positive growth, its economic growth rate is still lower than before and the downward pressure on the economy has increased, many catering and entertainment enterprises have gone bankrupt and closed down, and most of them are struggling to survive, so it has become a common initiative to reduce staff and salary. The possibility of unemployment upon graduation has increased their fear of the unknown and in this case, they are in urgent need of an alternative, either going onto higher education or starting their own business. In contrast, entrepreneurship is more feasible, especially with the popularization of innovation and entrepreneurship education, college students are more aware of entrepreneurship itself and have acquired certain thinking and methods to engage in entrepreneurial activities and the fear of failure in entrepreneurship is not unacceptable, although it is there. Studies have shown that economic crises and high unemployment potentially reducing employment opportunities and resulting in individuals losing their jobs or opportunities to pursue other careers, while also lowering their opportunity costs and making them more likely to choose entrepreneurship (Dawson and Henley, 2012; Sim\u00f3n-Moya et al., 2016). Moreover, Morris et al. (2020) found that entrepreneurship is promising for individuals with limited economic circumstances, with the simple creation and maintenance of a business demonstrating the potential to provide a better life. In this context, for individuals, especially college students facing employment, the difficulty of finding employment and the emergence of entrepreneurial\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 3 March 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 870705\nopportunities may reduce the perceived risk of entrepreneurship compared with employment, making it more likely for them to set aside their fear of failure in order to choose entrepreneurship. On this basis, we hypothesize that:\nH2: The event strength of COVID-19 pandemic can positively influence college students\u2019 entrepreneurial intentions through the mediation of fear of failure."

The former is oriented to growth needs, focuses on self-actualization, pursues success, and adopts a convergence strategy; the latter is oriented to security needs, focuses on fulfilling obligations, emphasizes avoiding failure, and adopts an avoidance strategy. Crowe and Higgins (1997) suggested that both the promotion- and prevention-oriented regulatory systems exist in individuals, with trait tendencies or specific contexts determining their dominance. Under COVID19 pandemic, downward pressure on the economy has increased, business operations are generally difficult, and salary reductions have become a common measure. The employment pressure of college students has increased and become more difficult, bargaining costs have increased, and competition has become more intense. In particular, when faced with an employer enterprise whose own operations are difficult and whose future is uncertain, the risks and costs of choosing to work for that enterprise are not necessarily significantly lower than those of self-employment and at the same time, the freedom and potential benefits that come with self-employment are lost. Khoa et al. (2020) suggested that most individuals are more vigilant when they recognize that the situation they are facing may have negative outcomes such as greater losses and tend to take other means to prevent it. Today\u2019s college students, called Generation Z, care about their own experiences and when they find a certain experience better, they actively promote it to their surrounding friends and classmates, while constantly trying new things and working to uncover the best values and services. While COVID19 pandemic is still ongoing, the vaccine is not yet widely injected and the means of prevention and control are mainly prevention and isolation. Although the anxiety of the public has been eased, there is still a sense of insecurity. With prevention regulatory focus, individuals seek safety, avoid losses, and tend to live and work in a safer and healthier way. Entrepreneurship has a higher degree of work flexibility and freedom, which can avoid the insecurity brought by frequent exposure and the inability to choose autonomously.\nTrait theory suggests that a positive, proactive personality that facilitates opportunity exploration and problem solving in situations of crisis and uncertainty is an important factor influencing entrepreneurial intentions, which may be enhanced, if individuals hold positive expectations about future outcomes (Hern\u00e1ndez-S\u00e1nchez et al., 2020). According to EscamillaFajardo et al. (2020) and others, the best way to deal with\nthe opportunities presented by crises is to be proactive in seizing them to fill market gaps and that while COVID-19 epidemic poses many problems and challenges, the solution to the problem may well be where the opportunity lies. As we know, China\u2019s internet economy is growing rapidly and e-commerce companies represented by Alibaba and Jingdong, in particular, are dominating the market. Looking back at the history of the two companies, we can see that it was the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 that gave rise to the transformation of the two companies, which led to the takeoff of e-commerce in China. What new industries and business models will emerge from COVID-19 epidemic and what impact it will have on the future are not yet predictable, but the empirical data from China show that online education and livestream shopping are favored by consumers and are performing remarkably well. College students follow the trends of the times, have a good grasp of the trends, are willing to try new things, and are able to clearly articulate their needs and actively seek solutions. With the promotion regulatory focus, individuals emphasize self-actualization and when they find that their demands are not fully satisfied or they can provide better solutions, they are willing to put in efforts and expect to gain benefits. In particular, as the pandemic progresses, the leading firms have made a shift and produced positive results, a phenomenon that greatly boosts individuals\u2019 confidence that it is feasible to imitate or improve this business model. Accordingly, we propose the hypothesis that:\nH3a: The event strength of COVID-19 pandemic can positively influence college students\u2019 entrepreneurial intentions through the mediation of prevention regulatory focus.\nH3b: The event strength of COVID-19 pandemic can positively influence college students\u2019 entrepreneurial intentions through the mediation of promotion regulatory focus."

            "text": "Hern\u00e1ndez-S\u00e1nchez et al. (2020) pointed out that psychological, cognitive, and personality variables contribute to the development of entrepreneurial intentions in uncertain or risky environments and this article found that fear of failure and regulatory orientation play an intermediate role. COVID-19 epidemic stimulated feelings of anxiety and insecurity of public and in the face of employment, the college student groups generally exhibited fear of failure. When facing potential risks, individuals differ in their tendency to be autonomous about the event and their willingness to influence the environment and fear of failure relates to the individual\u2019s tendency to be stable in influencing their behavior and environment. This generates shame about the possibility of potential failure, requiring the expenditure of cognitive resources to regulate negative emotions (Hirst et al., 2020). In order to achieve the imperative task of employment, college students need to engage in self-regulation, which can be specifically categorized\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 4 March 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 870705\nas prevention and promotion orientations. According to Leder et al. (2013), when thinking about the likelihood of making poor decisions, individuals with both the prevention and promotion regulatory focus should focus on avoiding negative outcomes, where it is more likely for individuals with prevention regulatory focus to worry about potential losses and more likely for individuals with promotion regulatory focus to worry about no gains. College students with prevention regulatory focus are willing to take responsibility and see employment as something they must accomplish at the end of their college career, which are responsible for themselves, for their families, and for society. Sim\u00f3n-Moya et al. (2016) argued that the survival rate of new ventures is instead higher in times of economic crisis than usual. Moreover, they argued that during economic downturns, due to the increased scarcity of paid work and the lower opportunity cost of entrepreneurship, the risk of individuals choosing entrepreneurship is not necessarily higher than the risk of unemployment and individuals may be more willing to engage in entrepreneurship rather than risking a high unemployment rate to find a job. When the risk of unemployment is elevated and the risk of entrepreneurship is relatively lower, individuals tend to avoid risk and entrepreneurial intentions are elevated under prevention regulatory focus. Most businesses have difficulty in surviving under the epidemic, but it is not difficult to find that the digital economy is developing strongly, especially online education and platform live streaming, which are relatively low threshold for entrepreneurship and are accessible and well understood by college students on a daily basis. Under promotion regulatory focus domination, individuals focus on earnings and success, college students value more the \u201copportunity\u201d in danger and although they fear failure, they noticed that there are already successful examples, which can be imitated and realized. The level of fear of failure is higher under the epidemic, but compared with employment, entrepreneurship can bring more benefits and sense of achievement to individuals and considering individuals\u2019 desire for success, individuals\u2019 willingness to start a business increased under the promotion regulatory focus. Accordingly, we propose the hypothesis that:\nH4a: The event strength of COVID-19 pandemic can positively influence college students\u2019 entrepreneurial intentions through the continuous mediation of fear of failure and prevention regulatory focus.\nH4b: The event strength of COVID-19 pandemic can positively influence college students\u2019 entrepreneurial intentions through the continuous mediation of fear of failure and promotion regulatory focus."

Combining the theoretical research with the empirical study of data obtained via questionnaires, we found that the event strength of COVID-19 pandemic has a positive effect on college students\u2019 entrepreneurial intentions and this relationship can be transmitted through the continuous mediating role of regulatory focus and fear of failure.\nHowever, the empirical results showed that hypothesis H3 was not proven, i.e., the fear of entrepreneurial failure did not play a significant role in mediating the relationship between the event strength of COVID-19 and college students\u2019 entrepreneurial intentions. This suggests that the event strength of COVID-19 cannot affect entrepreneurial intentions through fear of failure without considering the role of regulatory focus. This may due to the fact that, from an agentic perspective, self-regulation is required for individuals to cope with dynamic changes in the environment by consuming limited cognitive resource capacity. Locking in a relatively static future through fear of failure alone may make it difficult to adapt to rapid changes and form effective strategies, thereby further increasing cognitive resource consumption to cope with negative emotions such as fear of failure (Neal et al., 2017; Hirst et al., 2020). Thus, it may be difficult to adequately transmit the impact of the dynamic changes brought about by COVID-19 pandemic on students\u2019 entrepreneurial intentions through fear of failure alone."

While research explored the impact of major events such as natural disasters, pandemics, and financial crises, COVID-19 pandemic, unlike previous events, is a long-running, persistent public health crisis causing significant changes to people\u2019s lifestyles on multiple levels (Zahra, 2021). In the field of management, particularly in entrepreneurship, research has not yet had time to fully expand. This study addresses its impact on the college students\u2019 entrepreneurial intentions in order to explore the willingness of college students affected by the pandemic to take advantage of entrepreneurial opportunities and the theoretical underpinnings of these choices, thereby enriching the theoretical findings in this field.\nSecond, Hern\u00e1ndez-S\u00e1nchez et al. (2020) suggested that studying the willingness of pandemic-affected students (potential entrepreneurs) to start a business needs to be approached in terms of personality. Regulatory focus provides insight into the motivation of individuals to engage in behaviors.\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 8 March 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 870705\nThis article began with the RFT to investigate whether the pandemic-affected college students were willing to engage in entrepreneurship, demonstrating that, under the employment difficulties and opportunities brought about by COVID-19, prevention regulatory focus and promotion regulatory focus made college students less willing to be employed and more willing to start a business. In previous studies, the roles of the two regulatory focuses were often shown to be contradictory, but in the pandemic crisis, the roles of the two regulatory focuses on college students\u2019 willingness to start their own businesses were finally unified from different directions. From this point of view, the evidence presented herein may help to draw some new conclusions.\nFinally, in practice, the research results in this article help college students facing employment to better understand the impact of COVID-19 on current employment and market opportunities and also lead them to fully self-analyze when they face the decision of whether to start a business, so that during the pandemic and postpandemic eras, college students can be more rational when facing employment or entrepreneurship decisions. In addition, the results of this research are also useful for governments to provide more reasonable and effective information and guidance to college students and the general public. Therefore, these groups could make more rational choices and individuals with entrepreneurial potential and ideas could be guided to engage in entrepreneurial activities, thus contributing to stimulating economic activity and rebooting the economy."

It is believed that, with continued follow-up of students affected by the pandemic, more in-depth study may be developed in the future.\nSecond, as the pandemic varies greatly from country to country around the world, the extent of its impact on economic development, employment, and other things is also variable. In order to ensure the availability of research data, this study only collected data from Chinese college students; therefore, the findings are more applicable to China\u2019s national conditions;\napplicability to other countries may be reduced. Future research may choose college students from other countries as subjects or collect more extensive data to explore more generalizable research results.\nFinally, this article analyzes the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on entrepreneurial intentions from the perspective of college students\u2019 personality traits and emotions, but the factors affecting college students\u2019 entrepreneurial intentions may be broader and future research could focus on the role of more variables such as entrepreneurship education and entrepreneurship policies."
