    "abstractText": "Triacylglycerols (TAGs) are among the most important ingredients in food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical products. Many physical properties of such products, incl. morphology, texture and rheology, are determined by the phase behaviour of the included TAGs. Triglycerides are also of special interest for the production of solid lipid nanoparticles, applied for controlled drug delivery and for encapsulation of bioactive ingredients. In this paper, we study the polymorphic behaviour of complex TAG mixtures, composed of 2 to 6 mixed TAGs, by differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray scattering techniques, aiming to reveal the general rules for their phase behaviour upon cooling and heating. The results show that two or more coexisting phases form upon solidification (\u03b1, \u03b2\u2019 and/or \u03b2), the number of which depends strongly on the cooling rate and on the number of components in the mixture. No completely miscible \u03b1or \u03b2\u2019-phases were observed. The structure of the most stable \u03b2 polymorphs, formed upon subsequent heating of the solidified samples, does not depend on the thermal history of the samples. For all mixtures studied, we observed one-component \u03b2 domains, coexisting with binary mixed \u03b2 domains with composition and structure which do not depend on the specific TAG ratio in the mixture. In other words, for a mixture with k saturated TAGs we observed (2k-1) different \u03b2 phases. These conclusions provide some predictive power when analysing the phase transition properties of TAG mixtures.",

Many physical properties of such products, incl. morphology, texture and rheology, are determined by the phase behaviour of the included TAGs. Triglycerides are also of special interest for the production of solid lipid nanoparticles, applied for controlled drug delivery and for encapsulation of bioactive ingredients. In this paper, we study the polymorphic behaviour of complex TAG mixtures, composed of 2 to 6 mixed TAGs, by differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray scattering techniques, aiming to reveal the general rules for their phase behaviour upon cooling and heating. The results show that two or more coexisting phases form upon solidification (\u03b1, \u03b2\u2019 and/or \u03b2), the number of which depends strongly on the cooling rate and on the number of components in the mixture. No completely miscible \u03b1- or \u03b2\u2019-phases were observed. The structure of the most stable \u03b2 polymorphs, formed upon subsequent heating of the solidified samples, does not depend on the thermal history of the samples. For all mixtures studied, we observed one-component \u03b2 domains, coexisting with binary mixed \u03b2 domains with composition and structure which do not depend on the specific TAG ratio in the mixture. In other words, for a mixture with k saturated TAGs we observed (2k-1) different \u03b2 phases. These conclusions provide some predictive power when analysing the phase transition properties of TAG mixtures.\nKeywords: triacylglycerol, polymorphism, fat blends, melting, freezing"

            "text": "Triacylglycerols (TAG), also called triglycerides for simplicity, are esters of glycerol\n(propane-1,2,3-triol) and three fatty acids. They are widely used in pharmaceutical, food and cosmetic products as lipophilic matrices for dispersal or dissolution of essential ingredients, or as structuring components of the final products [1-9]. TAGs also play an indispensable role in the human diet, providing essential fatty acids and many vital lipophilic actives, and serving as an important energy source [5-8]. Depending on the type and chain length of the fatty acid residues in the TAG molecules, they are divided into two major groups \u2013 monoacid triglycerides which have identical fatty acid residues and mixed-acid triglycerides with different chain lengths [10]. The natural oils and fats, e.g. coconut oil, palm kernel oil, sunflower oil, peanut butter, cocoa butter, lard, etc., usually consist of a multicomponent mixture of mixed-acid triglycerides [8,10,11].\nThe phase behavior of natural oils and fats plays a crucial role for the texture, solubility,\nplasticity, glossiness, firmness and many other properties of various consumer products, incl. ice-cream, chocolate, margarine, butter, whipped cream and others in the food industry, and lip balms, creams and lotions in cosmetics [10,12,13]. Therefore, a deep understanding of the phase behavior of these systems is of fundamental importance for controlling and predicting these properties, and for optimization of the fat-based formulations when using healthier and/or more sustainable raw materials.\nTriglycerides exhibit monotropic polymorphism [10,14,15], i.e. there is a single\npolymorphic phase (denoted as \u03b2), whose energy is the lowest in the whole temperature range in which it may exist, see Figure 1a,b. However, two other, less stable polymorphs, denoted as \u03b1 and \u03b2\u2019, are known to form in simple monoacid triglycerides [10,14-16]. The stability and melting temperature of the various polymorphs increase in the order \u03b1\u2192\u03b2\u2019\u2192\u03b2. Once any of the more stable phases is formed, the phase transition is irreversible, i.e. if a sample is arranged in \u03b2\u2019 phase and we want to obtain \u03b1 phase, we need to melt the sample into the isotropic liquid phase and then cool it again. The polymorphic phase transitions may occur in two different ways: (1) upon heating via the so-called \u201cmelt-mediated\u201d route, by melting of the less stable polymorph and subsequent recrystallization into the more stable one, or (2) upon prolonged storage at a temperature which is lower than the melting temperature of the respective unstable polymorph via the so-called \u201csolid-state phase transition\u201d [10,14-18].\nThe least stable \u03b1 polymorph has hexagonally packed vertical chains which have almost\nstatistical orientation [10,14], thus resembling in some aspects the rotator phases of alkanes\n4\n[19,20], although the chain mobility near the glycerol group in triglycerides is more restricted by steric constraints [21]. The intermediate in stability \u03b2\u2019 polymorph has an orthorhombic sub-cell with tilted chains, and the most stable \u03b2 phase has triclinic parallel sub-cell with tilted chains [10,14], see Figure 1c. The melting temperatures of pure triglycerides in different polymorphic phases and their characteristic interplanar spacings have been extensively studied and are summarized in Figure 1d [10,14,15].\ntheir properties. (a) Possible phase transitions between liquid, \u03b1, \u03b2\u2019 and \u03b2 phases in TAGs. (b) Schematic presentation of the free energy of the phases as a function of temperature. (c) Sub-cell structures of \u03b1, \u03b2\u2019 and \u03b2 polymorphs of TAG crystals. Schematics in (a-c) are adapted from Refs. [10,15]. (d) Characteristic lamellar thicknesses, melting temperatures and enthalpies for pure triglycerides: tricaprylin (CaCaCa), tricaprin (CCC), trilaurin (LLL), trimyristin (MMM), tripalmitin (PPP) and triolein (OOO). SAXS positions for LLL and MMM are determined in the current study, whereas the other data are taken from Refs. [14,22].\nThe crystallization of TAG mixtures has been studied mainly in the context of natural\noils and fats with molecules containing mixed fatty acid residues [10,23-29]. The data for the phase behavior of monoacid TAG mixtures are relatively limited and include phase diagrams for several binary mixtures [18,21,30-36]. We are not aware of structural data in the literature about the phase behavior of multicomponent mixtures of monoacid TAGs.\nIn the studies about binary TAG mixtures, different types of phase behavior have been\nreported, depending on the chain-length mismatch of the mixed molecules. For binary mixtures with a chain-length difference of 2 C-atoms, such as LLL+MMM [10,18] and PPP+SSS [21,30,31,34,36], the formation of completely miscible solid solution phases in \u03b1 and \u03b2\u2019 polymorphs was reported, whereas a phase separation and eutectic phase were reported for the\n5\nmost stable \u03b2 polymorphs. In contrast, the phase diagrams for mixtures with bigger chain-length differences are rather complex [10,18,24]. Partial immiscibility was reported even for the \u03b1 and \u03b2\u2019 polymorphs in LLL+PPP and LLL+SSS mixtures [18,24]. Further discussion of the properties of the binary TAG mixtures is presented in Section 3.1.2, after presenting our new results.\nThe major aim of the current study is to investigate the role of the: (1) TAG mixture\ncomposition and (2) cooling protocol on the polymorphic phases obtained upon crystallization of monoacid triglyceride mixtures, and (3) related polymorphic phase transitions occurring upon subsequent heating of the solidified samples. Twelve different mixtures were prepared and studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and small-angle and wide-angle X-ray spectroscopy (SAXS and WAXS). The obtained results allowed us to define several general rules for the phase behavior, and to expand and refine the current understanding of the crystallization and melting processes in such mixtures.\nThe paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the materials and methods used.\nSection 3 is divided into two main subsections \u2013 the phase behavior of various LLL+MMM binary mixtures is discussed in Section 3.1, whereas the main results for the other studied mixtures are presented in Section 3.2. The main conclusions are summarized in Section 4."

They are denoted as \u201cMXy\u201d, where \u201cX\u201d shows the number of triglycerides in the mixture and the letter \u201cy\u201d (varied between a and f) is used when several mixtures with a given number of triglycerides are studied. The TAG chain-length in the mixtures was varied between 8 and 16 C-atoms for the triglycerides with saturated chains, namely from tricaprylin (C8TG, CaCaCa) to tripalmitin (C16TAG, PPP). We also studied triolein (C18:1TAG, OOO) which has three unsaturated C18 chains with a double-bond in the middle of each chain and the natural coconut oil (CNO, produced under the brand Dragon Superfoods by Smart Organic, Bulgaria). Tricaprylin (purity \u2265 97 %), tripalmitin (\u2265 85 %) and triolein (\u2248 65%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, while the other triglycerides studied \u2013 tricaprin (purity > 98%), trilaurin (>98%) and trimyristin (> 95%) were products of TCI Chemicals. All TAGs were used as received and the studied mixtures were prepared by weighting the necessary amount of each triglyceride. The mixtures were homogenized by melting. The total fatty acid composition of the most complex mixture, M6, resembles that of the natural CNO. However, the main fraction of the triglycerides in CNO has mixed chains [37], whereas all triglycerides in the model mixture studied are with\n6\nmonoacid chains, thus allowing us to compare the behavior of monoacid vs. mixed-acid TAG mixtures.\nUSA). The samples were placed in Tzero aluminum pans, weighted, closed with Tzero aluminum lids and then sealed hermetically using a Tzero sample press. The cooling rate was varied between 1 and 20\u00b0C/min, whereas the heating rate was fixed at 1\u00b0C/min in most of the experiments. Before each cooling step, the samples were pre-melted at 60 or 70\u00b0C and kept at this temperature for 5 min to ensure that the crystal memory of the samples is erased. In preliminary experiments we tested also longer storage periods (up to 1 h) at high temperature, but we did not observe any significant difference between the signals detected after 5 min or 1 h storage in the molten state. Both the cooling and the heating curves were recorded and then analyzed using the build-in functions of the TRIOS data analysis software (TA Instruments). These experiments gave us qualitative information about the phase transitions occurring upon temperature variation in the samples and quantitative information about the enthalpies of each phase transition.\nSmall- and wide- angle X-ray scattering (SWAXS) To study the molecular order of the triglyceride molecules in details, we performed time\nand temperature-resolved SAXS and WAXS measurements (denoted below as SWAXS) using Xeuss 3.0 equipment (Xenocs, France) with Cu K-\u03b1 radiation source, \u03bb \u2248 1.54 \u00c5. The scattered signal was detected with an EIGER2 4M detector (Dectris AG, Switzerland) at a sample-todetector distance of 286.5 mm. The Xeuss 3.0 equipment allows one to work without a beam stopper included, with the transmitted signal of the direct beam being also measured. The latter is used for intensity calibration of the obtained 1D profiles in the so-called \u201cabsolute intensity\u201d mode, which allows a direct comparison of the intensities in the separate experiments. The\n7\nexposure time for a single image varied between 30 and 300 s, and a 60 s exposure time was used in most experiments. The temperature of the samples was precisely controlled using a HFSX350 high temperature stage, equipped with T96 temperature controller and an LNP96 liquid nitrogen pump, all products of Linkam Scientific Instruments Ltd., UK.\nSamples were placed in cylindrical borosilicate glass capillary tubes with outer diameter\nof 1 mm and 0.01 mm wall thickness, a product of WJM-Glass, M\u00fcller GmbH, Germany. Three cooling protocols were applied in most experiments to clarify the effect of the cooling rate on the phases formed upon crystallization: (1) Controlled cooling with 1 or 1.5\u00b0C/min rate from the molten sample. This protocol is referred within the text as \u201cslow cooling\u201d; No any detectable difference was observed with these two cooling rates. (2) Controlled cooling with 20\u00b0C/min from molten sample; and (3) \u201cRapid cooling\u201d protocol which involved pre-cooling of the temperature stage down to -20\u00b0C or -50\u00b0C and then inserting the pre-melted sample into the cold stage. In this case, the temperature of the sample decreased from T \u2248 +70\u00b0C to the given subzero temperature in a few seconds only, i.e. the cooling rate in these experiments was approximately 20-30\u00b0C/s (viz. 1200 to 1800\u00b0C/min). In the text we refer to this cooling protocol as \u201crapid cooling\u201d or \u201c25\u00b0C/s\u201d. In all experiments, heating rate of 1.5\u00b0C/min was used unless otherwise noted. All measurements were carried out at least in duplicate. All samples were kept in a molten state for at least 5 min before the cooling onset to ensure that the crystal memory of the samples has been erased. In the preliminary series of experiments, we checked also longer periods for storage in a molten state, but we did not detect any difference between these experiments and the final protocol chosen.\nThe scattering due to the sample holder was subtracted to obtain the correct scattering\nintensity. To obtain the peak positions, we performed peak deconvolution analysis using Gaussian functions. The scattering profiles presented in the article are shifted with respect to the y-axis for clarity. All d-spacing values in the text are calculated by averaging the data from the first and the third-order reflections from at least two independent experiments."

The DSC signal obtained upon 20\u00b0C/min cooling from melt shows a broad peak between 22.7 and -5\u00b0C with two maxima at 18.9 and 13.3\u00b0C, see the blue\n8\ndash-dot curve in Figure 2a. These two maxima indicate that two consecutive freezing events occurred in this sample.\nSingle exothermic peak is observed upon slow cooling (2\u00b0C/min, light blue dashed curve; 1\u00b0C/min, green solid curve; 0.25\u00b0C/min, purple dashed curve), whereas two crystallization maxima are observed upon cooling at 20\u00b0C/min (dot-dashed blue curve). Note that the peak formed at 2\u00b0C/min has asymmetric shape. (b) Effect of cooling rate on the phases formed upon crystallization: \u03b2\u2019 phases form when 10\u00b0C/min or lower cooling rate is applied, whereas \u03b1-phases are observed at higher cooling rates or when a molten sample is inserted into a precooled stage (results for both -20\u00b0C and -50\u00b0C are shown in the figure). Two mixed coexisting phases are observed in all these experiments. (c,d) SWAXS curves obtained upon (c) rapid cooling to -50\u00b0C and (d) slow cooling at 1\u00b0C/min. Enlarged pictures of the primary and tertiary peaks, along with their deconvolution analysis, are shown as insets. See text for more detailed explanations.\nThe structural data obtained with the highest cooling rate (rapid cooling down to -20\u00b0C or\nto -50\u00b0C) confirmed that two coexisting phases with different lamellar spacings were formed, see Figure 2c. The primary peak, observed at scattering vector q \u2248 1.3-2.0 nm-1, had an asymmetric shape due to the partial overlap of the peaks arising from the two distinct phases. Their lamellar\n9\nspacings can be obtained after performing peak deconvolution analysis, leading to d1 = 3.98 nm (q \u2248 1.58 nm-1) and d2 = 3.69 nm (q \u2248 1.71 nm -1). The presence of these two phases is confirmed also by the tertiary peaks, in which the maxima are better separated: the separation of 0.13 nm-1 between the two maxima in the primary peak is tripled in the tertiary peak. At high q values, the spectra show a single broad peak with maximum at 15.3 nm-1, characteristic of the hexagonal \u03b1 phase. Therefore, the two coexisting phases in this sample are two immiscible \u03b1 polymorphs.\nThe lamella spacings in these two phases are intermediate between the spacings in the \u03b1\nphases of the pure triglycerides, d\u03b1LLL \u2248 3.55 nm and d\u03b1MMM \u2248 4.07 nm. Hence, both \u03b1 phases should contain LLL and MMM molecules, mixed in different ratios. The phase with a larger spacing should contain predominantly MMM molecules with a smaller fraction of LLL molecules, whereas the opposite is valid for the phase with a shorter spacing. The fractions of these two phases are approximately equal, as their peak areas are similar. To make the latter conclusion we assume that the specific response factors [13] for the signal obtained from the different domains are similar, because the LLL and MMM molecules belong to the same homologous series.\nAs previously suggested by Pizzirusso and coauthors [34], the most probable explanation\nfor the intermediate spacing in the mixed domains is that the terminal ethyl groups of the longer fatty acid residues cause a \u201csteric repulsion\u201d between the adjacent lamellae. This steric repulsion increases the distance between the corresponding planes in the mixed phase when compared to\nthe pure phase of the shorter triglyceride molecules, viz. from 3.55 for pure LLL to 3.69 nm for the LLL-enriched phase in the 1:1 LLL+MMM. As expected, the lamellar spacing of 3.98 nm of\nthe MMM-enriched  phase in the same 1:1 LLL+MMM mixture is intermediate between that of\nthe mixed LLL-enriched  phase (3.69 nm) and the pure \u03b1MMM phase (4.07 nm). A schematic presentation of these explanations is shown in Figure 3a-c.\n3.1.2 Effect of the cooling rate for the phases formed upon cooling of M2a We tested various cooling rates between 1\u00b0C/min (0.017\u00b0C/s) and ca. 25\u00b0C/s and always\nobserved crystallization of 1:1 LLL+MMM sample (M2a) into two coexisting phases, see Figure 2b-d. The type of the obtained phases depended on the cooling rate. Complete crystallization into the least thermodynamically stable \u03b1-phase was observed only with the rapid cooling protocol (25\u00b0C/s) which ensures sample crystallization within several seconds. At the intermediate cooling rate of 20\u00b0C/min we obtained predominantly \u03b1 domains. However, at this lower cooling\n10\nrate (compared to the rapid cooling) we observed also a small fraction of \u03b2\u2019 domains as the WAXS peak was slightly asymmetric, see Supporting Figure S1b.\nand heating of binary monoacid LLL+MMM mixture. See text for detailed explanations.\nEven lower cooling rates of 1 to 10\u00b0C/min resulted in the formation of \u03b2\u2019 phases with an\nintermediate stability, see Figures 2d and 4a. The lamellar spacing in these \u03b2\u2019 phases, 3.57 nm and 3.41 nm, was intermediate between those in the \u03b2\u2019 phases of pure TAGs, d\u03b2\u2019LLL = 3.26 nm and d\u03b2\u2019MMM = 3.71 nm. Therefore, these two phases also presented mixtures of LLL and MMM molecules. The presence of these two phases is unambiguously evidenced by the third-order reflection peaks in SAXS spectra, which exhibit two distinct maxima, see the inset graphs in Figure 2d.\nThe crystallization of these two coexisting \u03b2\u2019 phases occurred at similar temperatures\nupon slow cooling, see the SWAXS spectra shown in Figure 4a and Supporting Figure S3a. For that reason, the exothermic DSC peak had a Gaussian shape at a cooling rate \u2264 1\u00b0C/min, see Figure 2a. However, the peak became asymmetric at the higher cooling rate of 2\u00b0C/min, due to the two consecutive crystallization processes: initially, an MMM-enriched phase with a larger lamellar spacing crystallized, followed by the crystallization of an LLL-enriched phase. This conclusion was confirmed by X-ray scattering experiments at a fixed temperature, see Figure 4c,d. In this experiment we cooled the sample from 70\u00b0C down to 33\u00b0C at 1\u00b0C/min and then observed its crystallization at 33\u00b0C for a period longer than 1 h. Initially, a peak centered at a\n11\nlow q-vector appeared, evidencing the formation of the phase with a larger spacing, d \u2248 3.57 nm. After a few minutes, second peak at a higher q-vector appeared corresponding to the formation of LLL-enriched phase with d \u2248 3.41 nm. The primary peak maximum shifted to a slightly higher scattering vector (due to the formation of the second phase) and two distinguishable maxima were formed in the ternary peak, Figure 4c,d. The WAXS spectra evidenced that these two phases were of type \u03b2\u2019.\nheating. (a) SWAXS curves obtained upon cooling and heating at 1\u00b0C/min rate. (b) SWAXS curves obtained upon 1.5\u00b0C/min heating after rapid cooling to -20\u00b0C. The full spectra obtained upon cooling and heating are shown in Supporting Figure S3. (c) Isothermal crystallization of M2a mixture at 33\u00b0C (this sample had been precooled from 70\u00b0C to 33\u00b0C at 1\u00b0C/min cooling rate). The numbers next to the right-hand axis show the time in minutes, elapsed after the constant temperature has been established. Note that the phase with a predominant content of the longer MMM molecules appears first with peak at q \u2248 1.76 nm-1, whereas longer time is needed for the LLL-enriched phase to crystallize with a shorter lamellar spacing (see the second peak at q \u2248 1.84 nm-1). No changes in the SWAXS patterns are observed between 34 and 78 min (curves not shown). (d) Peak deconvolution analysis for the first and third-order reflections observed after 78 min of isothermal storage at 33\u00b0C. All molecules arrange in two distinct \u03b2\u2019 phases.\n12\nOne should note that our results (partially) contradict the interpretation given by\nTakeuchi et al. [18] about the phase diagram of the same LLL+MMM mixture. These authors concluded in Ref. [18] that \u03b1 and \u03b2\u2019 phases are miscible, forming solid-solution phases in the entire concentration range, whereas the stable \u03b2 phases exhibited a eutectic behavior. These conclusions were based on experiments with a protocol including 100\u00b0C/min cooling from 100\u00b0C to 0\u00b0C. This specific cooling rate was not accessible in our experimental equipment. However, as explained above, our experiments with rapid cooling to subzero temperature showed unambiguously that two coexisting \u03b1 polymorphs were formed in the samples even at very high cooling rates (ca. 25\u00b0C/s = 1500\u00b0C/min), Figure 2c. We note that the spectra for the LLL+MMM system presented in Ref. [18] show only the overlapping primary peaks, whereas the third-order reflection peaks, in which the two coexisting phases can be resolved, appears at scattering angles between 6\u00b0 and 8.5\u00b0 which are not shown in Ref. [18]. Therefore, we expect that the experiments described by Takeuchi et al. [18] most probably also involved the formation of two mixed \u03b1-phases (LLL-enriched and MMM-enriched), as found in the current study.\nThe results from coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations made by Pizzirusso et\nal. [33] for PPP+SSS mixtures suggest that the molecules remain randomly distributed when \u03b1 phase is formed. However, these simulations correspond to cooling rates which are by 7 orders of magnitude higher than those achieved in our experimental study. Indeed, the sample is quenched within 450 ns from 173\u00b0C to -73 or -98\u00b0C in the simulations, which corresponds to a cooling rate of \u2248 3.5\u00d71010 \u00b0C/min. Therefore, the formation of completely miscible \u03b1 phases could be possible under extremely fast cooling. In our experiments, however, two coexisting \u03b1 phases were always observed to form.\nWe note that data for possible formation of two coexisting \u03b1 polymorphs can be found in\nthe study by Himawan et al. [31] about the phase behavior of PPP+SSS mixtures. However, these authors concluded that the driving force for the observed immiscibility is rather small [31]. No structural data about the spacing or the amount of the two coexisting \u03b1 phases are presented in Ref. [31].\nIn summary, the obtained results show unambiguously that two coexisting phases with\ndifferent molecular compositions and different lamellar spacings form upon crystallization in a 1:1 mixture of LLL+MMM. In the present study, the cooling rate was varied within more than 3 orders of magnitude \u2013 from 1\u00b0C/min to ca. 25\u00b0C/s. Cooling rates \u2265 30\u00b0C/min were needed to obtain \u03b1 polymorphs, whereas crystallization into \u03b2\u2019 phases was observed at lower cooling rates. Below, we discuss how the spacing in these coexisting phases depends on the composition of the LLL+MMM mixture.\n13\n3.1.3 Effect of the LLL+MMM mixture composition on the phases formed upon cooling The effect of mixture composition was studied with six mixtures containing LLL and\nMMM of different ratios: 15:85; 30:70; 50:50; 70:30; 78:22; 85:15. Three cooling protocols were applied \u2013 controlled cooling with 20 and 1.5\u00b0C/min rates and rapid cooling to -20\u00b0C with rate \u2248 25\u00b0C/s. These protocols allow the formation of \u03b1 and \u03b2\u2019 phases as shown in Sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2. The mixture composition changed the specific lamellar spacing for these \u03b1 and \u03b2\u2019 phases, while the qualitative behavior of the samples remained similar to that described above for the M2a mixture (1:1 LLL+MMM).\nFigure 5 presents the characteristic lamellar spacings measured in the phases formed in\nthe various mixtures, as a function of LLL fraction in the mixture; see also Supporting Figure S1 for the original SWAXS curves. Only \u03b1 coexisting phases formed upon rapid cooling, Figure 5a. Their lamellar spacing was intermediate between those in the pure \u03b1MMM and \u03b1LLL polymorphs. The increase of LLL fraction in the mixture decreased the lamellar spacing of the phases, as expected. The relative fraction of the two phases varied approximately linearly with the change in the mixture composition for LLL \u2264 80 wt.%, whereas the sample with 85 wt.% LLL deviated very significantly from this trend, see Figure 5b.\nMixed \u03b1 coexisting phases formed upon rapid cooling to -20\u00b0C. (b) Fraction of the phase with longer d-spacing formed after rapid cooling. (c) Effect of cooling rate on the d-spacing: 20\u00b0C/min (red symbols) and 1.5\u00b0C/min (green symbols). The blue curves are given for comparison and represent the trends shown in (a) for rapid cooling. The circles show phases which are of type \u03b1, and the reversed triangles \u2013 of type \u03b2\u2019. The dashed horizontal lines in all graphs represent the spacings for the respective polymorphs of the pure TAGs. Two or three data points are shown at given LLL fraction and cooling rate \u2013 these points represent data for coexisting phases. See the text for more detailed explanations.\n14\nTwo phases with characteristic spacings of 3.65 \u00b1 0.01 nm and 3.52 \u00b1 0.05 nm were\nobserved in the sample containing 85 wt. % LLL. Their peak areas were 71 \u00b1 7 % and 29 \u00b1 7 %, respectively. The spacing of 3.52 nm indicates that the corresponding phase is pure \u03b1LLL phase. It coexisted with mixed LLL+MMM phase which should contain ca. 56 wt. % LLL and 15 wt. % MMM present in this mixture. Therefore, the ratio between the LLL and MMM molecules in the mixed domains is \u2248 4:1. In other words, these LLL-rich mixed domains coexisted with domains containing LLL molecules only. This result suggests that there could be some optimal ratio between the LLL and MMM molecules for efficient incorporation of the longer MMM molecules into an \u03b1-phase with a predominant LLL content, viz. LLL:MMM \u2248 4:1.\nNext, we studied the effect of cooling rate on the type of phases formed upon TAGs\ncrystallization. The SWAXS curves obtained upon cooling at 20\u00b0C/min showed the formation of \u03b1 and \u03b2\u2019 coexisting phases (compare the WAXS curves in Figures S1a and S1b). The formation of \u03b2\u2019 polymorph was confirmed also by the measured lamellar spacing \u2013 phase with a shorter spacing than both \u03b1LLL and \u03b1MMM was present in these samples. Therefore, this phase cannot be of type \u03b1, see the reversed red triangles in Figure 5c. In M2a mixture (1:1 LLL+MMM) the phase with a shorter d had very similar spacing to that of \u03b1 phase in pure LLL, see the reversed red triangle in Figure 5c for 50 wt. % LLL. Nevertheless, the WAXS peak was asymmetric in this sample, thus indicating the presence of \u03b2\u2019 domains as well.\nInterestingly, the phase with the largest lamellar spacing obtained upon cooling at\n20\u00b0C/min was identical to the MMM-enriched phase formed upon rapid cooling ( 25\u00b0C/s),\nwhen the LLL fraction was \u2265 50 wt. % \u2212 see the uppermost red circles in Figure 5c which coincide with the upper blue line. In the mixtures with a predominant MMM content, the respective spacing was a bit shorter (by ca. 0.18 \u00b1 0.05 nm) compared to that observed in the same samples upon rapid cooling. These results evidence that the reduction of the cooling rate from ca. 25\u00b0C/s to 20\u00b0C/min affects only the arrangement of the shorter LLL molecules. In contrast, the longer MMM molecules adopted similar configuration at these both cooling rates. This difference in behavior could be explained by considering the different mobility of the two molecular species \u2013 the additional time available prior to nucleation and crystal growth at 20\u00b0C/min cooling appears to be sufficient for better rearrangement of the shorter LLL molecules and for formation of a more ordered phase. The bigger MMM molecules need longer time for rearrangement and, hence, they acquire similar packing at these two cooling rates.\nThe interpretation of the three distinct maxima, observed in the third-order reflection\npeak for the samples with 15 and 30 wt.% LLL after 20\u00b0C/min cooling, is more complicated. The spectra for these samples are shown with red and violet curves in Supporting Figure S1b and\n15\nthe respective spacings are shown with red symbols in Figure 5c. The presence of three maxima suggests that (at least) three distinct phases form upon crystallization in these samples. Note that the respective spacings are very similar in these two samples. The phase with largest spacing (d \u2248 3.95 nm) should be a mixed \u03b1LLL/MMM polymorph, because this spacing is larger than the lamellar thicknesses of both \u03b2\u2019 phases of the pure TAGs, see the red circles in Figure 5c. This phase has a peak area of \u2248 19% from the total peak area. Similarly, the peak observed at the highest q-value can be attributed to mixed LLL-MMM \u03b2\u2019 polymorph, because the corresponding spacing d \u2248 3.47 nm is shorter than those of the \u03b1 polymorphs in pure LLL and MMM. The peak area for this phase is 20 \u00b1 5% or 37 \u00b1 11% from the total peak area for the 15 or 30 wt. % LLL mixtures, respectively. The main fraction of TAG molecules in these two samples (15 and 30 wt. % LLL) is included in the phase with a spacing \u2248 3.70 nm (peak area of \u2248 62% for 15 wt. % LLL sample and 53% for 30 wt. % LLL sample). To identify the nature of these peaks we first assumed that this is a phase of type \u03b1. Then we compared the measured spacings to those of the mixed LLL+MMM \u03b1-polymorphs, see the blue curves in Figure 5c. The intersection points between the horizontal line drawn at d = 3.70 nm and the blue lines will be at LLL:MMM \u2248 54:46 and LLL:MMM \u2248 83:17 for the two coexisting \u03b1 phases. In other words, mixed \u03b1 phase with 3.70 nm spacing could be formed at ratio of LLL:MMM \u2248 54:46 or LLL:MMM \u2248 83:17. In the studied mixtures of 15 wt. % and 30 wt. % LLL molecules, however, the fraction of LLL is much smaller compared to that of MMM. Thus, we conclude that our initial assumption, that the phases with d \u2248 3.70 nm formed in the 15 wt. % and 30 wt. % LLL mixtures are of type \u03b1, contradicts the experimental data.\nThe next simplest explanation would be that the phases with d \u2248 3.70 nm are \u03b2\u2019MMM\nphases. However, similar phases were observed also in the experiments with slower cooling rate (1.5\u00b0C/min), see the coinciding green and red symbols for 15 and 30 wt. % LLL in Figure 5c. The WAXS curves for the samples cooled at 1.5 and 20\u00b0C/min were completely identical to each other and very different from those observed at higher LLL fractions, see Supporting Figure S1b,c. Therefore, even upon slower cooling, a fraction of the molecules in these LLL+MMM mixtures arrange in \u03b1-polymorph with a spacing of d \u2248 3.67 nm, whereas the remaining molecules form pure \u03b2\u2019MMM polymorph with very similar spacing. Then, the final conclusion for the peak observed at q \u2248 1.70 nm-1 (d \u2248 3.70 nm) at 20\u00b0C/min cooling of samples with 15 or 30 wt. % LLL is that it is caused by the presence of both \u03b1 mixed LLL-MMM phase and a pure \u03b2\u2019MMM phase.\nThe same interpretation applies also for the phases formed at slower cooling, 1.5\u00b0C/min.\nIn this case the areas of the peaks with d \u2248 3.67 nm were 88% and 70% for the samples with 15\n16\nand 30 wt. % LLL, respectively. Therefore, at least 3 phases (one of type  and two of type \u2019) should be present in these samples to explain the observed scattering signals, despite the fact that two main maxima are observed only, see Supporting Figure S1c.\nIn the other experiments with slow cooling (1.5\u00b0C/min), we observed the formation of \u03b2\u2019\npolymorphs in the samples containing \u2265 50 wt. % LLL, whereas in the samples with a predominant fraction of MMM, we observed coexisting \u03b1 and \u03b2\u2019 phases. The phase with a larger d-spacing, formed at 1.5\u00b0C/min, turned out to be similar to the phase with a shorter spacing formed at 20\u00b0C/min (see the coinciding red and green reversed triangles in Figure 5c), whereas the second phase formed at 1.5\u00b0C/min had shorter lamellar spacing.\nSummarizing, two or more coexisting phases form in all systems studied. Under rapid\ncooling (\u2248 25\u00b0C/s) from melt, two coexisting \u03b1 phases are formed. Lower cooling rate ensures longer time for molecular rearrangement and more ordered \u03b2\u2019 phases are formed. The slow cooling of 1.5\u00b0C/min allows the formation of \u03b2\u2019 polymorphs in the mixtures containing predominantly shorter and more mobile LLL molecules. In contrast, coexistence of \u03b1 and \u03b2\u2019 domains is observed in the mixtures containing predominantly MMM, at the same cooling rate. Further decrease of the cooling rate would be needed to obtain samples ordered entirely in \u03b2\u2019 polymorphs in MMM-rich systems. We do not observe a direct formation of \u03b2 polymorphs upon cooling of LLL+MMM mixtures from melt at any of the cooling rates tested \u2265 1\u00b0C/min.\n3.1.4 Phase behavior of the binary mixtures upon heating Upon cooling, all studied binary LLL+MMM mixtures crystallized in the\nthermodynamically unstable polymorphic modifications, \u03b1 and/or \u03b2\u2019. Therefore, polymorphic phase transitions took place upon prolonged storage and/or upon heating of these samples to form the most stable \u03b2 polymorph, see Figure 4a,b.\nIn the current study, we heated the samples at 1 or 1.5\u00b0C/min rate, after the preceding\ncooling stage. The \u03b2\u2019\u2192\u03b2 phase transition in slowly precooled 1:1 LLL+MMM mixture began at temperatures close to the melting temperature of \u03b2\u2019LLL \u2248 35\u00b0C, see Figure 4a. Similarly, the polymorphic phase transition for the same sample which was rapidly cooled to crystallize in \u03b1 phase began at temperature close to the melting temperature of \u03b1LLL \u2248 15\u00b0C, see Figure 4b. These results show that the phase transition temperatures of the mixed phases are close to those of the pure shorter-chain components, included in the respective binary mixture. Similar conclusion was also made for all other multicomponent TAG mixtures studied (see Section 3.2 below).\n17\nIn the next paragraphs we first describe the structure of the \u03b2 phases formed after the\npolymorphic phase transition and then, using the formulated conclusions, we argue that a direct \u03b1\u2192\u03b2 phase transition most probably occurs in the rapidly precooled samples, without the formation of a long living intermediate \u03b2\u2019 phase, viz. the \u03b2\u2019 phase could appear only as a shortliving transient phase in these samples."

            "text": "The cooling/heating history of the samples did not affect the structure of the \u03b2 phases\nformed after the polymorphic transitions. Furthermore, we were able to explain the first and the third-order reflections, observed for the \u03b2 phases in all binary LLL+MMM mixtures studied, using three types of \u03b2 phases only \u2013 pure \u03b2LLL (d \u2248 3.15 nm), pure \u03b2MMM (d \u2248 3.57 nm) and mixed \u03b2LLL/MMM phase (d \u2248 3.39 nm). In all cases studied, the standard deviation in d is estimated to be ca. \u00b1 0.015 nm, see Figure 6a,b.\nLLL+MMM (a) and 7:3 LLL+MMM samples (b). The peak positions and relative areas (compared to the total peak area) are denoted on the graphs: orange - \u03b2MMM; green - \u03b2LLL/MMM and blue \u2013 \u03b2LLL. The cumulative fit peak is shown with black dashed curves and the red curve represents the original spectra. Note that a fourth peak (shown with purple) is used in the\n18\nanalysis of third-order reflections. This is a mixed reflection peak. Its area has been disregarded in the area analysis. (c) Relative content (based on the peak areas) of the different types of \u03b2 domains, observed in LLL+MMM mixtures. The lamellar spacings are d \u2248 3.15 nm for pure \u03b2LLL, d \u2248 3.57 nm for pure \u03b2MMM and d \u2248 3.39 nm for the mixed \u03b2LLL/MMM domains. (d) Lamellar spacings as functions of the temperature for rapidly crystallized 1:1 LLL+MMM sample (SWAXS curves are presented in Figure 4b). The circles show \u03b1 phases and squares \u2013 \u03b2 phases. The size of the symbols denotes the relative area of the respective peek, see the legend inset. The size of the empty red squares has been increased 4 times to make these symbols visible on the graph.\nThe presence of different \u03b2 phases was further confirmed by the observations made when\nthe samples were heated above the LLL melting temperature (T \u2248 47\u00b0C). When the melting temperature of the pure \u03b2LLL phase was reached, both the small \u03b2LLL peak and the peak for the mixed \u03b2LLL/MMM phase disappeared, whereas the \u03b2MMM peak remained and even increased its absolute area. This observation shows that at least part of the MMM molecules included in the mixed LLL/MMM domains remains in a crystalline state even after the mixed domains disappear in the sample. The \u03b2MMM peak remained present in the spectra until the temperature was further increased up to the melting temperature of pure MMM, see Figure 4a,b. Two consecutive melting events were observed also in the DSC thermograms as a wide peak in the range between ca. 40 and 57\u00b0C, with two well-pronounced maxima showing the melting of the LLL and MMM molecules, respectively, see Supporting Figure S2. These transitions are schematically shown in Figure 3d,e.\nThe relative fractions of these three phases depended on the mixture composition, see\nFigure 6c. The mixed \u03b2LLL/MMM phase had a maximum in the 1:1 LLL+MMM mixture, while the fractions of the pure \u03b2LLL and \u03b2MMM phases increased almost linearly with the concentration of the respective components when it became > 50 wt. % in the overall mixture. Small \u03b2MMM peaks were observed in all mixtures with a predominant content of LLL. In contrast, pure \u03b2LLL peaks were not seen in the samples containing 15 wt. % or less LLL. The latter result indicates that all LLL molecules are included in the mixed \u03b2LLL/MMM phase at a much low LLL concentration. Based on the obtained peak areas, one can estimate the ratio of the LLL and MMM molecules in the mixed \u03b2 domains. For the mixtures with ca. 50-80 wt. % LLL, this ratio is LLL:MMM \u2248 2:1, whereas this ratio became much higher for the mixtures with LLL fraction > 80 wt.%. The fact that the d-spacing does not change even when the ratio varies from 2:1 to ca. 10:1 (in 3:7 LLL:MMM mixture) shows that this spacing is governed mostly by the longer MMM molecules in the mixed \u03b2LLL/MMM domains. We note that an overall decrease in the total peak area, as well as disappearance of the mixed \u03b2LLL/MMM phase is observed for these mixtures once the LLL\n19\nmelting temperature is exceeded. The average domain size estimated by the Scherrer equation [38] was \u2248 34 \u00b1 16 nm for the \u03b2LLL domains and \u2248 52 \u00b1 16 nm for both the \u03b2LLL/MMM and \u03b2MMM domains.\n\u03b1\u2192\u03b2 transition for rapidly crystallized mixtures\nThe analysis of the peak positions and areas for the SWAXS data obtained upon heating\nfor the rapidly crystallized 1:1 LLL+MMM mixture (shown in Figure 4b) is presented in Figure 6d. This sample crystallized into two coexisting \u03b1 phases \u2013 one enriched in LLL and another enriched in MMM molecules. As this is the least stable TAG polymorph, there are two possible consecutive phase transitions which may occur upon heating: \u03b1\u2192\u03b2\u2019 and \u03b2\u2019\u2192\u03b2. Complete transformation of the \u03b1 domains into \u03b2\u2019 domains was certainly not observed in our experiments; instead, WAXS peaks for the \u03b2 polymorphs appeared at T \u2248 18-20\u00b0C, see Supporting Figure S3c. Thus, we tried to analyze the whole transformation sequence assuming the possible presence of 5 different phases in total for the whole temperature range: two \u03b1 phases and three \u03b2 phases, as explained above. The analysis shows that such an interpretation is possible if one assumes that the phase transition for a given phase occurs in a given time interval, instead of being instantaneous when a certain temperature is reached. Indications for such a behavior can be seen from the areas of the red and blue circles in Figure 6d. Once \u03b1LLL melting temperature is approached, the \u03b1LLL/MMM phase (with a higher LLL content) starts to transform into \u03b2 phase, but the peak for \u03b1LLL/MMM does not disappears completely until further heating. Similar results were observed for the other \u03b1MMM/LLL phase. We note that some transient short-living \u03b2\u2019 phase may be present in this sample, but its existence cannot be confirmed by the obtained experimental results, because some of its characteristic peaks in the WAXS range overlap with those for the \u03b1 and \u03b2 polymorphs.\nIn summary, three different \u03b2 phases were observed in all LLL+MMM binary mixtures\nafter \u03b1-to-\u03b2 or \u03b2\u2019-to-\u03b2 phase transition: pure \u03b2LLL phase, mixed \u03b2LLL/MMM phase and pure \u03b2MMM phase. The relative fractions of these phases depended on the LLL/MMM ratio in the mixture: for LLL \u2264 30 wt. %, the \u03b2MMM domains prevailed; for 50 wt. % \u2264 LLL \u2264 70 wt. %, the mixed \u03b2LLL/MMM phase prevailed; the \u03b2LLL phase was the most abundant at LLL > 70 wt. %. A direct \u03b1\u2192\u03b2 phase transition was observed in the samples pre-crystallized in \u03b1 phases, without the formation of long-living intermediate \u03b2\u2019 phases.\nThe phase transitions between the various polymorphs occurred around the melting\ntemperature of the prevailing component in the respective phase, e.g. the \u03b1\u2192\u03b2 phase transition started at lower temperatures compared to the respective \u03b2\u2019\u2192\u03b2 transition, as the melting\n20\ntemperature of \u03b1LLL phase is lower than that of \u03b2\u2019LLL. The melting of the \u03b2 phases began with the melting of the \u03b2LLL and the mixed \u03b2LLL/MMM phases, after which the amount of the \u03b2MMM domains increased. The latter coexisted with the already melted shorter LLL molecules within a range of several degrees, until the sample was heated up to the melting temperature of the pure MMM, see schematics in Figure 3.\n3.2 Phase behavior of complex monoacid triglyceride mixtures\nThis section presents the results obtained upon cooling and heating of several monoacid\nTAG mixtures, containing three or more molecular species. The exact composition of these mixtures and their nomenclature are presented in Table 1 above. These mixtures were designed in the following way: we started with the ternary mixture which contained the three main fatty acid residues present in the coconut oil, mixed in equal fractions (1:1:1, mixture M3a) and in a ratio similar to that in CNO, viz. LLL:MMM:PPP = 60:25:15 (mixture M3b). Then we sequentially increased the sample complexity by adding other monoacid TAGs to finally obtain mixture M6 (CaCaCa:CCC:LLL:MMM:PPP:OOO = 7:8:50:18:10:7) with total fatty acid content equivalent to that of the natural coconut oil (CNO). Thus we studied the effect of triglyceride mixing and compared the obtained structural information to that for CNO. Note, however, that CNO has equivalent total fatty acid content to M6, but includes TAG molecules with mixed fatty acid residues. Thus, we could compare the monoacid TAGs with the mixed-acid TAGs of the same fatty acid chemical composition, while having different distributions of the fatty acid residues in the TAG molecules. To better understand the observed trends, several intermediate mixtures were studied as well.\nThe results for the phase transitions occurring in these samples, cooled at 1.5 and\n20\u00b0C/min rates, are shown in Figures 7 and 8, Tables 2-3 and Supporting Figures S4-S15. For some of these samples we studied also the phases formed upon rapid cooling to subzero temperatures. Polymorphism was observed in all studied samples. The respective phase transitions were detected as exothermic peaks in the DSC curves (see the green and blue regions in Figure 7b), while the peaks in the scattering experiments changed their positions to reflect the changes in the phases formed.\n21\ndifferent triglyceride mixtures. (a) Data, obtained upon cooling. All peaks are exothermic and show freezing processes. (b) Data obtained upon subsequent heating at 1\u00b0C/min rate. The green and blue regions represent exothermic peaks, corresponding to polymorphic phase transitions, whereas the orange and red regions represent endothermic peaks, i.e. melting processes. (a,b) For each sample, the first row shows the information obtained upon 20\u00b0C/min cooling and subsequent 1\u00b0C/min heating. The second row shows results obtained upon 1\u00b0C/min cooling and heating. The peak maxima are shown with black lines. The enthalpies are denoted with \u0394H and the subscripts \u201ccr\u201d, \u201cp\u201d and \u201cm\u201d correspond to crystallization, polymorphic transition and melting, respectively. The melting enthalpy is average of the two types of experiment with different heating rates and the experimental accuracy is \u00b1 2 J/g. The precise composition of the studied TAG mixtures is presented in Table 1.\n3.2.1 Phases formed upon cooling of multicomponent mixtures Ternary mixtures We investigated the phase behavior of two ternary mixtures, composed of LLL, MMM\nand PPP molecules and mixed in different ratios: LLL:MMM:PPP = 1:1:1 (denoted as M3a) and LLL:MMM:PPP = 60:25:15 (M3b). Three distinct phases were formed in M3a mixture upon rapid cooling to -20\u00b0C with characteristic lamella spacings of 3.68, 4.18 and 4.43 nm, see Supporting Figure S4a,b. Their peak areas were approximately 27, 39 and 34% from the total peak area, respectively, i.e. the phase with an intermediate thickness was the most abundant one. The WAXS profile showed that all these phases were of type \u03b1. A comparison between the measured spacings in the mixed sample and the characteristic spacings for the \u03b1 polymorphs of\n22\npure LLL (d\u03b1,LLL \u2248 3.55 nm), MMM (d\u03b1,MMM \u2248 4.07 nm) and PPP (d\u03b1,PPP \u2248 4.54 nm) shows that all \u03b1 domains formed upon crystallization of M3a mixture should contain mixed TAG molecules. The phase with the largest spacing most probably contains mixed MMM and PPP molecules, whereas the one with the shortest spacing contains a mixture of LLL and MMM molecules. Note that the latter phase is identical to the one formed upon rapid crystallization of LLL:MMM = 50:50 mixture, see the blue circles in Figure 6d above. Analyzing the TAG species distribution using the peak areas, one sees that the mixed phase with an intermediate thickness (d = 4.18 nm) should contain all three TAG species present in this mixture, with a predominant fraction of MMM. The PPP should be present because 4.18 nm > d\u03b1,MMM \u2248 4.07 nm, whereas some LLL molecules should be also present as the peak area for the mixed LLL+MMM peak is too small to accounts for all LLL molecules present in this sample.\nThe SWAXS spectra obtained upon cooling of M3a mixture at 20\u00b0C/min is presented in\nSupporting Information Figure S4c. The third-order peak analysis showed the formation of four phases \u2013 three phases with a spacings identical to those seen after the rapid cooling (d = 3.67 nm, 4.20 nm and 4.42 nm) and an additional phase with a shorter spacing of 3.38 nm.\nThe latter phase with the spacing of 3.38 nm was a very small fraction with a relative\npeak area of \u2248 10% only. Although the WAXS signal appeared as characteristic for \u03b1 polymorph with a single wide symmetric peak centered around \u2248 15.3 nm-1, this phase could not be of type \u03b1, as it has a characteristic spacing which is shorter than that for the shortest TAG in the mixture, d\u03b1,LLL \u2248 3.55 nm. Therefore, we conclude that upon 20\u00b0C/min cooling, three \u03b1 phases form in the M3a mixture, which coexist with a limited amount of \u03b2\u2019 phase containing predominantly LLL molecules, mixed with a small fraction of MMM molecules. Note that LLL and MMM have shorter fatty acid residues compared to PPP, thus they rearrange faster upon cooling and, due to their lower melting temperatures, LLL and MMM have longer time available for rearrangement.\nM3a sample (LLL:MMM:PPP = 1:1:1) crystallized into three coexisting \u03b2\u2019 phases when\ncooled at lower rate of 1.5\u00b0C/min, see Supporting Figure S4e. These phases had lamellar spacings of 3.35 nm, 3.76 nm and 3.98 nm, which are intermediate between those for the pure \u03b2\u2019 phases, i.e. these phases contain mixed TAG molecular species.\nWe also investigated the phase behavior of the ternary mixture LLL:MMM:PPP =\n60:25:15 (M3b). This sample crystallized in four distinct types of \u03b1 domains when was rapidly cooled, d = 3.50, 3.63, 3.90 and 4.23 nm, see Supporting Figure S5a,b. In this case, the 3.50 nm domains were about 10% and contained LLL molecules only, whereas the other three types of domains contained mixtures of molecules. We note that we were able to obtain a good fit to the cumulative peaks using only three distinct peaks. However, in the latter case, the peak areas\n23\n(45.5; 13.5 and 41 %) did not match with the lamellar spacings (4.24 nm, 4.10 nm and 3.65 nm, respectively) and the TAG composition of the samples. The 4.24 nm phase should contain mainly MMM and PPP molecules, but their total content is 40% in the mixture. At the same time, the phase with the shortest spacing should also contain MMM molecules, because its spacing is larger compared to the pure \u03b1LLL phase. Thus, the interpretation with the four distinct types of domains is more realistic.\nFour distinct phases were needed to explain the SWAXS curves obtained upon 20\u00b0C/min\ncooling of M3b sample with d \u2248 4.31, 3.99, 3.57 and 3.35 nm (first order peak maxima at q \u2248 1.46, 1.58, 1.77 and 1.87 nm-1, respectively), see Figure 8a and Supporting Figure S5a,c. In contrast to M3a sample, in this case \u03b1 domains were with slightly different spacings when compared to those observed after rapid cooling, however, again \u03b2\u2019 phase was formed (d \u2248 3.35 nm). Decrease of the cooling rate to 1.5\u00b0C/min led to the formation of three \u03b2\u2019 phases with d \u2248 3.69, 3.41 and 3.30 nm, see Supporting Figure S6. The peak areas were \u2248 4:3:3 for the three peak respectively.\nWe expect that the molecular mechanism determining the intermediate spacings in mixed\nTAG domains is similar to the one proposed by Pizzirusso et al. [34] for the binary PPP+SSS mixtures, see the schematics shown in Figure 3. Briefly, a \u201csteric repulsion\u201d is caused by the longer fatty acid residues included in the domains with a predominant content of shorter TAG molecules, thus increasing the overall interlamellar thickness. In the opposite case, when shorter molecules are included in domains with a predominant content of longer TAG molecules, they act as \u201cdefects\u201d in the crystalline order of mixed domains and leave free space for inclusion of the terminal groups of neighboring longer molecules, which leads to overall decreased lamellar thickness, see also the related discussion for the redistribution of the molecular species upon cooling and heating presented in Section 3.1.4 above. The only significant difference observed with the more complex mixtures compared to the binary TAG mixtures seems to be the higher number of combinations in which the individual species may mix together.\nMixtures containing \u2265 4 mixed TAG Four monoacid TAG samples containing 4 or more mixed species were studied to verify\nthat our conclusions are not limited to the simpler 2 or 3-component mixtures, but can be applied also to more complex systems. Sample M4 contained four TAG species: CCC:LLL:MMM:PPP = 15:50:20:15. Upon rapid cooling to subzero temperature, this sample crystallized into four coexisting \u03b1 phases: d \u2248 3.18 nm (10%), 3.62 nm (49%), 4.05 (17%) and 4.33 nm (24%), where the percentage denotes the relative area of the respective peak, see Supporting Figure S8a. The\n24\nmost abundant type of domains (d \u2248 3.62 nm) was identical to that observed with the 3- component mixtures, see above. Furthermore, the same phase was identified in more complex 5- and 6-component mixtures, see Table 2 and the related discussion below. The main fraction of the shortest CCC molecules was included in the domains with a 3.18 nm spacing.\nFour distinct phases were observed also when M4 sample was cooled at 20\u00b0C/min rate,\nsee Supporting Figure S7b. In this case, along with the \u03b1 domains (d \u2248 4.05 and 4.38 nm) containing predominantly the longer TAG molecules in the mixtures, \u03b2\u2019 domains were also formed (d \u2248 2.97 and 3.32 nm). The most abundant phase was the one with d \u2248 3.32 nm (peak area \u2248 46%). Finally, we tested also 1.5\u00b0C/min cooling rate to allow sufficient time for the molecular rearrangement of all different TAG species. Five distinct phases were observed when this protocol was applied: d \u2248 2.91 nm (8%), 3.29 nm (31%), 3.40 nm (11%), 3.60 nm (32%) and 3.88 nm (18%), see Supporting Figure S7a.\nTo check whether the long-chain molecules crystallize before the shorter TAGs (similarly\nto the process observed with 1:1 LLL+MMM, Figure 4c above), we performed isothermal crystallization experiment with this sample (CCC:LLL:MMM:PPP = 15:50:20:15). The molten sample was cooled at 1.5\u00b0C/min rate from 70 to 35\u00b0C and then the temperature was kept at 35\u00b0C for a period of 1 h. As seen from the results shown in Supporting Figure S7c, the crystallization began about 10 min after the constant temperature was established. Initially, a peak with maximum at q \u2248 1.62 nm-1 appeared, viz. the phase with the largest d-spacing formed first. The peak gradually increased its area, but no further peaks appeared at this temperature for 1 h. The main fraction of TAG molecules remained in a liquid state. Three new peaks appeared in the SAXS spectra when the temperature was decreased down to 27\u00b0C, due to the crystallization of the main fraction of LLL and MMM molecules. The CCC molecules remained in a liquid state even after a 30 min storage at this temperature. The peak corresponding to the smallest spacing (d \u2248 2.91 nm) appeared when the temperature was further decreased down to ca. 10\u00b0C. This result shows unambiguously that the crystallization behavior of the complex TAG mixtures is qualitatively similar to that observed in the simpler mixtures. However, larger number of phases is formed in such samples, due to the larger number of components mixed.\nVery similar phases were formed upon rapid cooling of M5a, M5b and M6 samples, see\nSupporting Figure S8. The main TAGs included in these samples are LLL (50 wt. %), MMM (18 wt. %), PPP (10 wt. %) and CCC (15% in M5a and M5b and 8 wt. % in M6). M5a sample contains also 7 wt. % CaCaCa, whereas the latter is exchanged by OOO in M5b. M6 sample contains both 7 wt. % CaCaCa and 7 wt. % OOO. The \u03b1 phases had slightly shorter spacings compared to the phases formed in M4 sample, due to the inclusion of shorter-chain molecules, d\n25\n\u2248 3.00 nm (\u2248 4% for M6 and \u2248 6.5% in M5), 3.33 nm (\u2248 8%), 3.61 nm (\u2248 43%), 3.96 (\u2248 24.5%) and 4.23 nm (\u2248 18%). Most abundant was the phase with 3.61 nm spacing.\nIllustrative results about the phases formed upon cooling in M5a, M5b and M6 samples\nupon 1.5\u00b0C/min and 20\u00b0C/min cooling are presented in Figures 8b,c and Supporting Figures S911. Coexisting domains of \u03b1 and \u03b2\u2019 type were observed upon 20\u00b0C/min cooling, whereas at 1.5\u00b0C/min rate \u03b2\u2019 and \u03b2 domains were formed. The respective spacings are presented in Table 2. In such complex mixtures, the specific spacing of the \u03b2\u2019 phases cannot be determined precisely, because no experimental conditions were found to arrange all molecules in \u03b2\u2019 domains. In the slowly cooled samples, the \u03b2\u2019 phase coexisted with \u03b2 domains, whereas in the mixtures cooled at 20\u00b0C/min rate \u03b1 domains always coexisted with \u03b1, \u03b2 and/or liquid phases. We note that although some spectra seemed to have only two main maxima in the first order peaks (see for example Supporting Figure S10a or S11c), the analysis of both the first and third-order reflection peaks revealed four to eight different types of coexisting domains formed upon crystallization. As for the simpler mixtures, these phases had intermediate spacings when compared to those of the pure monoacid TAGs included in the mixtures. As expected, the crystallization always started with the longest TAG species, whereas the shorter ones remained in a fluid state down to much lower temperatures. This is easily seen from the temperature-resolved SAXS curves obtained at 1.5\u00b0C/min cooling, see Supporting Figures S9, S10a and S11. In all these spectra, initially the first-order SAXS peaks at lower q-vectors appear, whereas additional peaks showing the crystallization of the shorter TAGs appear at lower temperatures.\n1.5\u00b0C/min heating of M3b sample after 20\u00b0C/min cooling.

The cooling curves for (c) are shown in Supporting Figure S9. See the main text for more detailed explanations of the scattering spectra. The mixture compositions are shown in Table 1.\n26\nThe present study is focused on the phase behavior of monoacid TAG mixtures.\nHowever, the natural oils and fats contain predominantly TAG molecules with mixed fatty acid residues. To check how our results compare with the respective properties of the natural CNO, we performed SWAXS experiment with CNO as well. We note that the total composition of M6 mixture resembles the total fatty acid content in CNO. However, our mixtures contain monoacid\nTAGs only, whereas  80% of the TAG molecules in CNO have mixed chains [37].\nSupporting Figure S12 shows the spectra for CNO. Two main peaks are observed upon\nrapid cooling from melt with d \u2248 3.30 and 3.82 nm. The primary peak in M6 sample could be fitted with these two spacings if the two separate maxima at q \u2248 1.53 and 1.71 nm-1 are combined into a single maximum at q \u2248 1.65 nm-1. This comparison shows that the averaged lamellar spacing of the phases formed in M6 sample is similar to that of the phases formed in CNO. However, due to the different fatty acid distribution in the model mixture, the monoacid TAG molecules prefer to pack with each other in separate domains instead of forming a single mixed phase with a larger number of mixed species. Furthermore, the temperature at which the 3.35 nm phase in M6 undergo polymorphic phase transition, T \u2248 4-5\u00b0C, coincides with the temperature for \u03b1+\u03b21\u2019\u2192\u03b22\u2019 phase transition in CNO. However, as the TAG molecules in M6 sample have monoacid chains, they pack more tightly in \u03b2 phase which melts at much higher temperature, whereas the mixed-acid chains in CNO allow formation of a single \u03b22\u2019 phase for all CNO molecules which then melts at a much lower temperature compared to M6, see Table 3.\nIn contrast, the phases formed upon slow cooling in M6 mixture with characteristic\nspacings of 4.12 nm (5%), 3.70 nm (25%), 3.34 nm (25%), 3.15 nm (41%), 2.70 nm (2%) and 2.24 nm (2%) differed significantly from the single thermodynamically stable \u03b22\u2019 phase formed in CNO (d \u2248 3.39 nm). This comparison shows that the monoacid triglyceride molecules can pack much better and phase separate from each other upon slow cooling which is not the case for"

            "text": "3.2.2 Polymorphic phase transitions in multicomponent mixtures upon heating After the initial crystallization of the model mixtures upon cooling, further polymorphic\nphase transitions occurred in these samples. These transitions began at significantly lower temperatures for the samples which were cooled at a faster rate, because they contained predominantly the least stable \u03b1 phase. This temperature was ca. 16 \u00b1 3\u00b0C for 2- and 3- component mixtures, whereas it was \u2248 0 \u00b1 3\u00b0C for 5- and 6-component mixtures, see the green regions in Figure 7b. For the samples cooled at lower rates, the temperature at which the\n27\npolymorphic phase transitions began (in this case \u03b2\u2019 \u2192 \u03b2) was significantly higher \u2013 compare the green and blue regions in Figure 7b.\nIn agreement with the obtained structural data, the freezing enthalpies were significantly\nhigher for the slowly cooled samples which arranged in \u03b2\u2019 or in \u03b2\u2019+\u03b2 phases, compared to the rapidly cooled samples which froze in \u03b1 or \u03b1+\u03b2\u2019 phases. This difference was compensated when the polymorphic phase transitions occurred to include the enthalpy for the \u03b1\u2192\u03b2 transition. For that reason, the polymorphic transition enthalpy for the quickly cooled mixtures, \u0394Hp, was by 10-25 J/g higher than \u0394Hp measured upon heating of slowly precooled samples, see Figure 7b.\nFigure 9 presents illustrative SAXS spectra for the \u03b2 phases formed in the\nmulticomponent mixtures. The structure of these phases did not depend on the thermal history of the samples, as explained above for the binary mixtures \u2013 the structure was exclusively determined by the molecular content of the mixtures. As explained in Section 3.1, the LLL+MMM mixtures were found to crystallize always in three coexisting \u03b2 phases: \u03b2LLL, \u03b2LLL/MMM and \u03b2MMM (see section 3.1.4 above). Hence, it was interesting to see whether this conclusion applies also when the mixtures contain more than two molecular species.\nTable 2. Structure of \u03b2 phases formed in TAG mixtures after cooling and subsequent slow\nheating. The fraction of the various phases was determined from the \u03b2 phase spectra obtained after rapid cooling to T = -20\u00b0C. The average standard deviation of the d-values is ca. \u00b1 0.01 nm for the pure \u03b2 phases and \u00b1 0.02 to 0.05 nm for the mixed \u03b2 phases. The interlamellar spacings are described (R2 = 0.999) by the equation 0.222 0.4682d n  + nm, where n is the average number of C-atoms in the fatty acid residues.\nq, nm-1 d, nm Phase abundance in TAG mixtures, %\nM2a M3a M3b M4 M5a M5b M6\n\u03b2CaCaCa 2.81 2.23 3 \u00b1 1 1 \u00b1 0.5 \u03b2CaCaCa/CCC 2.52 2.49 1 \u00b1 0.5 2 \u00b1 1 \u03b2CCC 2.34 2.68 2 \u00b1 0.2 7 \u00b1 3 4 \u00b1 2 4 \u00b1 3 \u03b2CCC/LLL 2.19 2.88 13 \u00b1 7 1 \u00b1 0.5 2 \u00b1 1 3 \u00b1 2 \u03b2LLL 2.00 3.15 11 \u00b1 3 8 \u00b1 2 39 \u00b1 4 31 \u00b1 8 46 \u00b1 3 54 \u00b1 5 52 \u00b1 2 \u03b2LLL/MMM 1.85 3.39 62 \u00b1 10 13 \u00b1 4 12 \u00b1 6 12 \u00b1 7 5 \u00b1 1 6 \u00b1 4 9 \u00b1 1 \u03b2MMM 1.75 3.57 27 \u00b1 10 24 \u00b1 9 21 \u00b1 2 13 \u00b1 4 14 \u00b1 12 15 \u00b1 1 14 \u00b1 1 \u03b2MMM/PPP 1.66 3.78 33 \u00b1 13 19 \u00b1 7 19 \u00b1 5 15 \u00b1 6 15 \u00b1 2 11 \u00b1 3 \u03b2PPP 1.56 4.02 22 \u00b1 3 9 \u00b1 4 10 \u00b1 4 8 \u00b1 4 4 \u00b1 2 4 \u00b1 1\nFive different \u03b2 phases were expected to form in M3 mixtures in which LLL, MMM and\nPPP molecules were included: \u03b2LLL (d \u2248 3.15 nm), \u03b2LLL/MMM (3.39 nm), \u03b2MMM (3.57 nm), \u03b2MMM/PPP (3.78 nm) and \u03b2PPP (4.02 nm). The d-spacings for the LLL+MMM phases are those\n28\ndetermined in the experiments described above, whereas the d-spacing for \u03b2MMM/PPP phase was determined in a separate experiment with binary 1:1 MMM+PPP mixture, see Supporting Figure S13. Indeed, using these 5 phases we were able to perform peak deconvolution analysis and to obtain very high R2-values for both M3a (LLL:MMM:PPP = 1:1:1) and M3b (LLL:MMM:PPP = 60:25:15) mixtures, see Figure 9c,d and Table 2. The only difference between these samples was the relative peak areas for the different phases: (\u03b2LLL + \u03b2LLL/MMM) : (\u03b2MMM + \u03b2MMM/PPP + \u03b2PPP) \u2248 21:79 \u00b1 6% for M3a and \u2248 51:49 \u00b1 4% for M3b samples. We note that the individual peak areas are determined with a relatively big error (see Table 2) because several different deconvolution analyses can be made yielding similar R2 values. Nevertheless, the ratios presented above are determined with better accuracy because the LLL peaks are well distinguished from the MMM/PPP peaks. Note that the total MMM+PPP content in both M3 samples is smaller when compared to the observed peak areas. Thus, we expect that some fraction of the LLL molecules is included in the mixed \u03b2MMM/PPP phase, but without changing it characteristic interlamellar spacing.\nmixtures. The peak deconvolution analysis for these spectra is presented in (c,d). Peak maxima\n29\nand relative peak areas are written on the graphs. (b) SWAXS spectra for 4- and 5-component mixtures. Samples composition is given in Table 1.\nThe further increase of the number of mixed TAG species increased also the number of\nphases that can be formed in the most stable polymorphic phase. Seven different \u03b2 phases were observed in M4 mixture (CCC:LLL:MMM:PPP = 15:50:20:15), see Table 2. They included the 5 phases already identified in M3 mixtures (i.e. in the absence of CCC) as well as \u03b2CCC/LLL and \u03b2CCC phases. Illustrative peak deconvolution analysis is presented in Supporting Figure S14.\nFigure 9b shows a comparison between the \u03b2 phases formed in M5 and M6 mixtures. To\nobtain these profiles we first cooled these samples to -20\u00b0C at 20\u00b0C/min rate, then heated them to 35\u00b0C at 1.5\u00b0C/min rate to allow for the polymorphic phase transitions to occur, and finally decreased the temperature down to -20\u00b0C again to allow for crystallization of all TAGs, because OOO and CaCaCa were in a liquid state at T \u2265 30\u00b0C (temperatures needed for the LLL rearrangement into \u03b2 domains). M5 and M6 mixtures have similar TAG composition to M4 sample (see Table 1) and, hence, they crystallized in similar \u03b1 or \u03b2\u2019 phases as explained in the previous section. Similar \u03b2 phases were observed as well upon heating. Once again, these \u03b2 phases were explained assuming the formation of pure \u03b2 domains containing different (saturated) TAGs, coexisting with binary mixed \u03b2 phases, Table 2. The only noticeable difference between the various spectra was that \u03b2CCC phase had a well pronounced peak in M5a mixture (the pink curve in Figure 9b), whereas this peak was missing when CaCaCa was exchanged by OOO (the green curve in Figure 9b), or it was smaller when both CaCaCa and OOO were present (the blue curve in Figure 9b). We note that separate peaks for OOO could not be identified in M5b and M6 samples because the position of the peak is similar to the one for PPP.\n3.2.3 Melting trends The DSC thermograms of the quickly cooled M4, M5 and M6 mixtures (see Table 1 for\ncomposition of these mixtures) showed small endothermic peak (\u0394H \u2248 3-10 J/g), prior to the polymorphic phase transitions and the subsequent main melting, see the red regions in Figure 7b and Supporting Figure S15. The structural analysis revealed that this peak corresponds to melting of the domains containing the shortest molecules in the mixtures \u2013 tricaprylin and/or tricaprin, see Figure 8c. The same process was also observed in the SAXS curves of the slowly cooled samples, see Supporting Figure S11a,b. However, this melting was not visible in the DSC experiments of the slowly cooled samples because it overlapped with the polymorphic phase transition occurring simultaneously with greater enthalpy, see Supporting Figure S15. This result\n30\nindicates coexistence between a small fraction of already molten molecules and frozen domains of the longer TAG molecules \u2013 these crystalline domains remain present up to much higher temperatures. We expect that the distinct crystalline domains are surrounded by the liquid phase of the shorter molecules, similarly to the melting behavior observed with the two-component mixtures, see Figure 3e.\nThe DSC analysis shows several important trends, regarding the main melting process\nobserved at T > 25\u00b0C. The melting enthalpy decreases with the complexity of the mixtures. This enthalpy decrease cannot be explained only by considering the fraction of molecules melting at lower temperatures (CCC or CaCaCa), because their contribution into the overall enthalpy of the mixture is relatively small. Furthermore, if one estimates the \u201ctheoretical melting enthalpy\u201d using \u0394Hm for the pure triglycerides and their fraction in the mixtures, much higher value of \u0394H \u2248 195 \u00b1 6 J/g is expected, instead of the observed experimentally \u0394H \u2248 140 to 156 J/g for 4-6 component TAG mixtures (see Figure 7). The measured smaller enthalpies evidence that the degree of ordering inside the crystal domains decreases greatly when different chain-lengths are mixed, due to the disturbed packing in the latter systems. Note that even lower enthalpy was measured with CNO, \u0394Hm,CNO \u2248 110 J/g. In addition, the melting temperatures of M6 and CNO are also quite different, reflecting the difference in the molecular packing \u2013 the complete CNO melting is observed at ca. 28\u00b0C, while the six-component mixture melts completely at T \u2248 55\u00b0C, see Table 3.\nThe melting temperatures of the other model mixtures were also determined primarily by\nthe longest TAGs in the mixture and varied between ca. 52\u00b0C for M2b (7:3 LLL+MMM) to 62\u00b0C for M3a which contains 33.3% PPP. The temperature interval of (complete) melting widens significantly when TAGs with a shorter chains and lower melting temperatures are present. For example, the melting interval is ca. 10\u00b0C for the binary LLL+MMM mixture, whereas it becomes nearly 20\u00b0C for the three-component mixtures and increases up to more than 30\u00b0C for the six-component mixture when the latter is slowly heated after quick cooling, see the orange regions in Figure 7b.\nThe melting of the saturated TAGs always started with the TAG having the shortest\nchains and proceeded consecutively until the melting temperature of the longest TAG in the mixture was approached. However, the melting temperature of the PPP phases in all mixed samples was by ca. 4-10\u00b0C lower compared to that of the pure bulk PPP (TmPPP \u2248 66\u00b0C), most probably due to the molecular solubility of the PPP molecules in the surrounding, already melted triglyceride phase.\n32"

            "text": "We studied the polymorphic phase behavior of various TAG mixtures, upon their cooling\nand subsequent heating. The experimental conditions, such as mixture composition, applied cooling rate, storage time and temperature, were varied systematically in wide ranges. The main observed trends are briefly summarized below:\nUpon rapid cooling with rate \u2265 30\u00b0C/min, two immiscible \u03b1 phases are formed in the\nbinary LLL+MMM mixtures. Each of these \u03b1 phases is a mixture of LLL and MMM molecules of different ratios and their interlamellar spacing increases with the MMM fraction in the overall mixture. Upon rapid cooling of three-component or more complex in composition mixtures, three or more mixed immiscible phases are formed which could be of \u03b1 and \u03b2\u2019 type.\nUpon slow cooling of 1\u00b0C/min, the TAG molecules in the two- and three-component\nmixtures arrange in mixed \u03b2\u2019 domains, whereas several \u03b2\u2019 and \u03b2 domains are formed in the mixtures containing four or larger number of components.\nUpon slow heating with ca. 1\u00b0C/min, these \u03b1 and \u03b2\u2019 phases transform into the most stable\n\u03b2 phases. The structure of the formed \u03b2 polymorphs does not depend on the thermal history and on the specific composition of the mixture. As a rule, (2k \u2013 1) different \u03b2 phases are formed in the mixtures containing k different even-numbered saturated TAG species: k single-component \u03b2 phases for all individual TAG species in the mixture, along with (k-1) binary mixed \u03b2 phases, composed of TAGs with neighboring chain-lengths. For example, \u03b2LLL, \u03b2LLL/MMM and \u03b2MMM phases were observed in all LLL+MMM mixtures. For all TAGs studied (C8 to C16 fatty acid residues) and their binary mixtures, the interlamellar spacing can be estimated as d \u2248 0.222n + 0.4682 nm, where n is the average number of C-atoms in the fatty acid residues, e.g. 13n = for the LLL+MMM mixture.\nThe actual melting of the TAG mixtures upon heating starts from the shortest molecular\nspecies with the lowest melting temperature. Coexistence between the already molten TAG species and still frozen domains is observed in wide temperature intervals, when TAGs with significantly different chain-lengths are mixed.\nThe current study advances significantly our understanding of the polymorphism in\nmixtures of monoacid TAGs which are often used as model systems for the natural oils and fats. Such knowledge is particularly important in several application areas, incl. foods, beverages, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. Our results can serve also as a basis for other studies in related areas, e.g. to clarify the effects of various additives (medical drugs, essential nutrients, solid\n33\nnanoparticles, etc.) and/or confinement (bulk vs layers vs microencapsulated/emulsified samples) on the polymorphic transitions.

SWAXS curves obtained at different cooling rates for LLL+MMM mixtures. (a) Rapid cooling to -20\u00b0C from melt. \u03b1-polymorphs form in the samples. (b) Controlled cooling with 20\u00b0C/min rate. Two or even three \u03b1 + \u03b2\u2019 co-existing phases form in the samples. (c) Controlled cooling with 1.5\u00b0C/min rate. Samples with \u2265 50 wt. % crystallize in two co-existing \u03b2\u2019 polymorphs, whereas in the samples with predominant MMM content, both \u03b1 and \u03b2\u2019 domains are formed. The phase identification is based on the WAXS spectra.\n40\nSupporting Figure S2. DSC curves obtained upon cooling and heating of M2a sample (LLL+MMM = 1:1). The cooling rate determines the crystallization temperature and polymorphic phase formed upon freezing: \u03b1 domains are formed upon 20\u00b0C/min cooling, whereas \u03b2\u2019 domains form upon slower cooling. Upon heating, the samples undergo polymorphic phase transition(s) forming the most stable \u03b2 polymorph. The melting of \u03b2 domains does not depend on the temperature history of the sample. In both cases \u2013 initially LLL molecules melt, followed by the melting of the longer MMM molecules at slightly higher temperature (see the double maxima).\n41\nSupporting Figure S3. SWAXS curves obtained for M2a mixture (LLL + MMM = 1:1) under different cooling-heating protocols. (a) 1\u00b0C/min cooling and subsequent heating. (b) 1.5\u00b0C/min heating of sample cooled at 20\u00b0C/min rate. (c) 1.5\u00b0C/min heating of sample cooled rapid at -20\u00b0C.\n42\nSupporting Figure S4. SWAXS curves for M3a mixture (LLL+MMM+PPP = 1:1:1). (a,b) Scattering curve obtained by rapid cooling to -20\u00b0C and the respective peak deconvolution analysis. (c,d) Scattering curves obtained upon 1.5\u00b0C/min heating of quickly cooled sample (cooling rate 20\u00b0C/min). Four co-existing phases form in the sample with predominant content of three \u03b1 phases and very small content of \u03b2\u2019 phase (the cyan peak). (e,f) Scattering curves obtained upon 1.5\u00b0C/min cooling from melt (c) and subsequent heating with 1.5\u00b0C/min. Two coexisting \u03b2\u2019 phases are formed upon cooling in this protocol with characteristic lamellar thicknesses of 3.39 and 3.90 nm, respectively.\n43\nSupporting Figure S5. SWAXS curves obtained upon rapid cooling to -20\u00b0C (a,b) and at 20\u00b0C/min cooling (a,c) of M3b mixture (LLL+MMM+PPP = 60:25:15). (b,c) presents peak deconvolution analysis for the spectra obtained at -20\u00b0C.\n44\nSupporting Figure S6. SWAXS curves obtained upon (a) 1.5\u00b0C/min cooling and (b) heating of M3b mixture (LLL + MMM + PPP = 60:25:15). The characteristic lamellar thicknesses of the \u03b2\u2019 phases formed in this case are 3.30, 3.41 and 3.69 nm, see the peak deconvolution shown in (c).\n45\nSupporting Figure S7. SWAXS curves for M4 mixture (CCC+LLL+MMM+PPP = 15:50:20:15) obtained at different temperature profiles: (a) Slow cooling and slow heating at 1.5\u00b0C/min. (b) Slow heating after fast cooling at 20\u00b0C/min. (c) Curves obtained upon cooling from 70\u00b0C to 35\u00b0C at 1.5\u00b0C/min cooling rate. After that the temperature is kept constant for 1 hour and the scattering signal is monitored at every few minutes. Note that only one phase appears with d \u2248 3.89 nm at this temperature. Another four phases appear consecutively upon further cooling and five distinct phases (in total) are observed at -20\u00b0C.\n46\nSupporting Figure S8. SWAXS curves for M4, M5a, M5b and M6 mixtures obtained upon rapid cooling from melt. All mixtures crystallize in \u03b1 mixed domains. Small differences are observed only in the phases with the shortest lamellar spacings (b). Mixtures compositions: M4: CCC+LLL+MMM+PPP = 15:50:20:15; M5a: CaCaCa+CCC+LLL+MMM+PPP = 7:15:50:18:10; M5b: CCC+LLL+MMM+PPP+OOO = 15:50:18:10:7 and M6: CaCaCa+CCC+ LLL+MMM+PPP+OOO = 7:8:50:18:10:7.

Both scattering profiles are obtained at temperature of -20\u00b0C, but CNO crystallize in different polymorphs, depending on the cooling rate: \u03b1-phase is observed upon direct cooling to -20\u00b0C from melt (green curve), whereas \u03b22\u2019 phase is detected upon slower cooling at 1.5\u00b0C/min (red curve).\n51\nSupporting Figure S13. \u03b2 phases observed in MMM+PPP = 1:1 mixture. Three distinct phases are identified: \u03b2PPP (d \u2248 3.95 nm), \u03b2PPP/MMM (d \u2248 3.79 nm) and \u03b2MMM (d \u2248 3.54 nm).\n52\nSupporting Figure S14. Peak deconvolution analysis for \u03b2 phases observed in M4 (CCC +LLL+MMM+PPP = 15:50:20:15) mixture. Seven different types of domains have been identified: PPP, PPP/MMM, MMM, MMM/LLL, LLL, LLL/CCC, and CCC. Peak maxima and relative peak area are denoted on the graphs. Note that the green peak (q \u2248 5.84 nm-1) in the right-hand-side graph is caused by mixed (hkl) reflection and it has been disregarded in the analysis.\n53\nSupporting Figure S15.
