1. **Investigate the long-term impact of cash transfer UHC+ interventions on TB treatment outcomes and catastrophic cost incurrence for TB-affected households.** This could be done through a longitudinal study that follows beneficiaries of a cash transfer UHC+ intervention over time to assess their TB treatment adherence, treatment outcomes, and household expenditures.


2. **Explore the feasibility and acceptability of integrating social workers into the health system to provide tailored psychosocial support to people with TB.** This could be done through a pilot study that implements a social work intervention in a TB clinic and evaluates its impact on patient satisfaction, treatment adherence, and treatment outcomes.


3. **Develop and evaluate a microcredit program specifically designed for TB-affected households.** This could be done through a partnership between a microfinance institution and a TB program, with the goal of providing TB-affected households with access to low- or no-interest loans to cover the costs of TB care and other essential needs.


4. **Conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of different social protection interventions for TB.** This could be done by comparing the costs of different interventions to their impact on TB treatment outcomes, catastrophic cost incurrence, and other relevant outcomes.


5. **Explore the potential for using mobile technology to deliver social protection interventions for TB.** This could be done through a pilot study that develops and evaluates a mobile app that provides TB-affected households with information about social protection programs, access to financial assistance, and other forms of support.
