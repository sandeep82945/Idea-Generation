The portion of the text that mentions future research directions is:

"Nevertheless, despite the intensive research efforts, clinically significant results have not been achieved yet, and further improvements are required. Mahmoud et al. recently highlighted that a focus should be put on the methods of preparation of the nanoparticle delivery systems in order to increase bench to bedside translation [9]. They suggested that novel, green, and ecofriendly methods that do not depend on organic solvents would improve the scalability of production and decrease production costs, while eliminating the risk of the presence of toxic residuals. This perfectly aligns with the formulation approach adopted in our investigation, which was based on an easy, organic, solvent-free, and efficient procedure leading to nanosized, stable, biocompatible vesicles."
