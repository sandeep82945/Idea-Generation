    "abstractText": "The physicochemical properties of binary systems are of great importance for the application of the latter. We report on the investigation of an ammonium sulfamate\u2013urea binary system with different component ratios using a combination of experimental (FTIR, XRD, TGA/DSC, and melting point) and theoretical (DFT, QTAIM, ELF, RDG, ADMP, etc.) techniques. It is shown that, at a temperature of 100 \u25e6C, the system under study remains thermally and chemically stable for up to 30 min. It was established using X-ray diffraction analysis that the heating time barely affects the X-ray characteristics of the system. Data on the aggregate states in specified temperature ranges were obtained with thermal analysis and determination of the melting point. The structures of the ammonium sulfamate\u2013urea system with different component ratios were optimized within the density functional theory. The atom-centered density matrix propagation calculation of the ammonium sulfamate\u2013urea system with different component ratios was performed at temperatures of 100, 300, and 500 K. Regardless of the component ratio, a regular increase in the potential energy variation (curve amplitude) with an increase in temperature from 100 to 500 K was found.",

            "text": "Urea (carbamide, diamide of carbonic acid) is a low-molecular-weight hygroscopic organic molecule composed of a carbonyl group attached to two amine residues [1,2]. It is a white crystal soluble in polar solvents (water, ethanol, and liquid ammonia) [3]. Urea is produced with a large capacity for use mainly as a nitrogen-release fertilizer [4,5]. Another important industrial application of urea is the synthesis of urea\u2013formaldehyde resins, which serve as adhesives in fiberboard and furniture production [6,7]. In addition, urea derivatives are known to be efficient herbicides [8,9]. Urea and its derivatives find application in medicine [1,10].\nMolecules 2023, 28, 470. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28020470 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 470 2 of 33\nThe physicochemical properties of mixtures of urea with various substances are important to investigate in order to establish the origin of intermolecular interactions and understand their interplay [11\u201313]. Ammonium sulfamate is a crystalline ammonium salt of sulfamic acid highly soluble in water [14]. It can be used as a herbicide [15], a fire-protecting additive [16], an additive in the fabrication of cigarette paper [17], and a deicer [18]. The physicochemical properties of ammonium sulfamate are being intensively studied to expand its application range [19\u201322]. In [18], the eutectic and other thermodynamic properties of a water\u2013urea\u2013ammonium sulfamate system were experimentally examined. The study was based mainly on thermodynamic modeling and, according to the results of the physicochemical analysis, only the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data on the solidus\u2013liquidus point were reported. In [23], the volumetric properties of this system were explored. Despite the increasing number of works on binary systems in general and urea in particular, the ammonium sulfamate\u2013urea system remains understudied. In this work, the ammonium sulfamate\u2013urea system with different component ratios is characterized experimentally (FTIR, XRD, and TDA/DSC) and theoretically (DFT, QTAIM, RDG, etc.)."

For all the investigated samples, many absorption bands were observed in the spectra within 3500\u20132800 cm\u22121, which correspond to the NH3+ and NH2 vibrations [24]. The abundance of absorption bands in the spectra is related to the amino and ammonium groups in ammonium sulfamate and urea, as well as to the effect of different groups on them, which lead to the protonation and deprotonation in the system [25]. The bands at 1250\u20131260 and 1060\u20131070 cm\u20131 can be attributed to the superposition of vibrations of the C\u2013N and SO3 groups in this region. To establish the thermal and chemical stability of the ammonium sulfamate\u2013urea system, samples with different component ratios were examined using FTIR spectroscopy after heating at 100 \u25e6C for 0\u201330 min (Figure 1). The data obtained (Figure 1) suggest that the chemical interaction between ammonium sulfamate and urea with the formation of new chemical bonds does not occur. In other words, this mixture is chemically and thermally stable at temperatures of up to 100 \u25e6C for up to 30 min. For more detail concerning the thermochemical properties, see Section 2.1.3 (TGA/DSC)."

We carried out the XRD investigations of the ammonium sulfamate\u2013urea samples with different component ratios processed at a temperature of 100 \u25e6C for different times (Figure 2). It can be seen in Figure 2 that a change in the component ratio in the ammonium sulfamate\u2013urea system is reflected in a change in the XRD spectra. In particular, the peaks at 35 and 45\u25e6 2\u03b8 increase significantly with the urea content in the system. Heating of the investigated system changes the XRD spectra. In general, in the region of 24\u201334\u25e6 2\u03b8, the intensity of the peaks lowers and they slightly shift. However, this is only observed at certain component ratios. At an ammonium sulfamate: urea ratio of 1:1 and a heating time of 5 min, the material is amorphized; as the processing time increases, its crystallinity returns.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 470 3 of 33Molecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 36\nMolecules 2023, 28, 470 4 of 33Molecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 36\nMolecules 2023, 28, 470 5 of 33Molecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 36\nHeating time\nASA:U ratio 1:1\n0\n5\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900\n1000\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70\nIn te\nns ity\nDegree, 2 theta\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900\n1000\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70\nIn re\nns ity\nDegree, 2 theta.

Kinetic Analysis of the Thermal Decomposition of the Ammonium Sulfamate\u2013Urea System\nTheoretical calculations of the decomposition of the ammonium sulfamate-urea system were carried out using the Coates\u2013Redfern kinetic model [29]. The kinetics of decomposition of the studied samples in the region of the main thermal destruction of the substance was analyzed (TGA data). The results are presented in Table 1.\nAs can be seen from the data in Table 1, with an increase in the content of urea molecules in the mixture to 2, the activation energy of the thermal destruction of the mixture decreases, while the pre-exponential factor increases, which reflects the frequency of collisions of active molecules. These characteristics give reason to believe that with this increase, the thermal stability of the mixture decreases (the number of less reactive interactions increases). At a ratio of 3, the activation energy slightly decreased, and with an increase in the ratio of components to 4, the value of the activation energy remained at the same level. Thus, it can be assumed that for samples 3 and 4, in the period of the main thermal decomposition, the bonds of groups with similar properties break. The activation energy of the decomposition of ammonium sulfamate (49.6 kJ/mol) is higher than the activation energy of sulfamic acid (46.8 kJ/mol) [30]. This also affects the values of pre-exponential factors: for ammonium sulfamate \u22127.2 \u00d7 106 s\u22121, and for sulfamic acid \u22122.1 \u00d7 105 s\u22121. In addition, these differences also affect their mixtures with urea. For mixtures of ammonium sulfamate with urea in ratios of 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, and 1:4, activation energies are observed: 54.7, 48.5, 45.5, and 45.4 kJ/mol, respectively. For a mixture of sulfamic acid with urea with similar molar ratios, the following activation energies are observed: 58.0, 53.4, 47.6, and 44.8 kJ/mol, respectively [30]. The values in these systems are insignificant due to the proximity of the structure of these substances.\n2.1.5. Melting Point and Thermodynamic Calculation\nThe melting point is an important characteristic of binary systems, including crystalline ones [31]. In the ammonium sulfamate\u2013urea system with different component ratios, the melting point of the mixture is generally lower than that of the initial materials (see Table 2) due to the eutectic phenomena in the mixture. The ammonium sulfamate\u2013urea system with a component ratio of 1:1 has the lowest melting point. Compared to the sulfamic acid-urea system [30], higher melting points are observed for similar ratios (Table 2). Based on the data on the melting points and results of the thermal analysis, we generalized the temperature dependence of the state of aggregation of the ammonium sulfamate\u2013urea mixture with different component ratios (Table 3).\nMolecules 2023, 28, 470 15 of 33\nIt should be noted that there is a certain error in the data obtained, which is composed from the instrumental error and the sample humidity influencing these characteristics. The melting points obtained were used to calculate the physicochemical parameters, including the chemical potential and effective interaction parameter. In the calculation, it was assumed that the ammonium sulfamate\u2013urea system is similar in some physicochemical properties to the sulfamic acid\u2013urea system, which is a deep eutectic solvent [30]. Further calculation of the characteristics is justified by comparing these two systems.\nThe \u2206\u00b5iT values calculated using Equation (1) are given in Table 4.\nAccording to the data given in Table 3, the \u2206\u00b5iT value for ammonium sulfamate in the ammonium sulfamate\u2013urea system ranges from \u22122.06 to \u22124.94 kJ/mol. For urea in this system, the \u2206\u00b5iT values are from \u22120.68 to \u22122.06 kJ/mol. In general, this parameter for the ammonium sulfamate\u2013urea system is comparable with that for the sulfamic acid\u2013urea system [30], differing only at some points. The effective interaction parameter \u03c7 calculated directly from the melting point of the mixture makes it possible to reliably describe the complete solid\u2013liquid equilibrium in the system [32]. The effective interaction parameter ranges from \u22122.46 to \u22122.77 for ammonium sulfamate and from \u22122.77 to \u22125.57 for urea (Table 5). With an increase in the number of urea molecules in the ammonium sulfamate\u2013urea system, the effective interaction parameter decreases from \u22122.77 to \u22125.57. In general, the effective interaction parameter \u03c7 of the ammonium sulfamate\u2013urea system is comparable to that of the sulfamic acid\u2013urea deep eutectic solvent [30].\nMolecules 2023, 28, 470 16 of 33\nTable 5.

Theoretical Study of the Ammonium Sulfamate\u2013Urea System Previously [30], we studied the mixture of sulfamic acid with urea, which represents a deep eutectic solvent.

Nevertheless, study of the interaction between these substances can be relevant for understanding its nature and determining the range of possible applications of the mixture. Quantum-che ical research methods are actively used to study binary syste s [33,34]. For small molecules, the DFT method in the B3LYP/6-311++G(d, p) basis set showed the highest efficiency [35,36]. The primary optimization of the structure of the ammoniu sulfamate\u2013urea system with different component ratios was carried out using the DFT method in the B3LYP/6311++G(d, p) basis set (Figure 5).\nMolecules 2023, 28, 470 17 of 33\nIt can be seen in Figure 5 that the change in the component ratios in the ammonium sulfamate\u2013urea system leads to a change in the ammonium sulfamate and urea bond lengths. In particular, the N\u2013H bond lengths in the ammonium cation of the ammonium sulfamate\u2013urea system with one urea molecule range within 1.019\u20131.580 \u00c5 (Figure 5a). When the second urea molecule is added to the system, this range changes for 1.021\u20131.074 \u00c5 (Figure 5b). In addition, it was observed that the addition of more urea molecules had little effect on the ammonium cation bond lengths in the studied system. The bond length for a sulfo group of ammonium sulfamate (S=O) in the system with one urea molecule is 1.467 \u00c5. One more urea molecule added elongates this bond to 1.489 \u00c5. Further addition of urea molecules changes this bond length insignificantly. For the S\u2013N bond in ammonium sulfamate, lengths of 1.688\u20131.700 \u00c5 were observed. It is worth noting that, in the sulfamic acid\u2013urea system studied in [30], the length of this bond decreased from 1.6658 to 1.6117 \u00c5 with an increase in the number of urea molecules in the system from one to four. At the same time, the length of this bond in aqueous ammonium sulfamate clusters [22] ranges from 1.6851 to 1.6975 \u00c5, while with an increase in the number of water molecules from one to four, the S\u2013N bond extends. Despite the data obtained, it has not been explained by a quantum-chemical approach yet why urea is a less efficient activator when arabinogalactan is sulfated with ammonium sulfamate [37] than when it is sulfated with sulfamic acid [38].\n2.2.1. HOMO-LUMO Analysis\nThe FMO theory, including the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMO-LUMO) is one of the best theories for explaining the chemical stability of molecules [39]. The HOMO and LUMO energies for ligands and complexes provide information on the energy distribution and energy behavior. Negative EHOMO and ELUMO values are indicative of the stability of compounds [40]. The difference between energies of LUMO and HOMO orbitals, that is, the energy gap (ELUMO-EHOMO), is indicative of the chemical reactivity and kinetic stability of molecules [41,42]: a molecule with a wide HOMO-LUMO gap is identified as having high chemical hardness and good stability, and is much less polarizable. Molecules with a narrow HOMO-LUMO gap have good chemical reactivity and chemical softness and are more polarizable. That is, a wide HOMO-LUMO gap suggests a high molecular stability and low chemical reactivity [43]. The HOMO and LUMO energies reflect the ability to donate and receive an electron, respectively. A high HOMO energy is characteristic of a molecule more active in reactions with electrophiles, while a low LUMO energy corresponds to molecular reactions with nucleophiles [44]. A molecule with a narrow boundary orbital gap is highly polarizable and exhibits a significant degree of intramolecular charge transfer from an electron donor to an electron acceptor and conjugation, which can affect the biological activity of a molecule [45].\nA three-dimensional view of HOMO-LUMO is presented in Figure 6.\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 18 of 36\ncules had little effect n th ammonium cation bond lengths in the tudied system.

It should be noted that the picture observed for the sulfamic acid\u2013urea system [30] was somewhat different: the energy gap decreased uniformly from 7.39 to 6.69 eV with an increase in the number of urea molecules from one to four. At the same time, the energy gap in water clusters of ammonium sulfamate [22] for a system with one to four water molecules ranges within 7.71\u20136.68 eV.\nFigure 6.

The maximum electron affinity, electronegativity, chemical potential, chemical softness, global electrophilicity index, charge transfer index, and optical softness and the minimum ionization potential, chemical hardness, and nucleophilicity index among the investigated systems were observed in the ammonium sulfamate\u2013urea system with four urea molecules. The calculation of the thermodynamic characteristics is widely used to predict the reactivity and other physicochemical characteristics of compounds [46,47]. Table 7 gives some thermodynamic parameters of the ammonium sulfamate\u2013urea systems with different contents of urea molecules.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 470 20 of 33\nAccording to the data listed in Table 7, the E(RB3LYP) value changes almost uniformly from \u2212962.23145 to \u22121638.1316 a.u. when the content of urea molecules in the ammonium sulfamate\u2013urea system changes from one to four. The dipole moment, in turn, changes nonuniformly. Thus, a decrease from 7.65 (in the system with one urea molecule) to 5.30 Debye (in the system with two urea molecules) is observed, after which the dipole moment increases to 11.87 Debye (in the system with four urea molecules). The values of other nonlinear-optical (NLO) parameters, including the hyperpolarizability and polarizability, also increase almost uniformly with the number of molecules in the ammonium sulfamate\u2013urea system. This phenomenon was also observed in the sulfamic acid\u2013urea [30], ammonium sulfamate\u2013water [22], sulfamic acid\u2013water [48], and thiourea\u2013water systems [49]. The correction factors (the zero-point energy correction, thermal energy correction, thermal enthalpy correction, and thermal free energy correction) also increase with the number of urea molecules in the system (see Table 7). It is noteworthy that the values of the other thermodynamic parameters (E (thermal), heat capacity, and entropy) also increase with the number of urea molecules in the system under study and this increase is almost linear. The results obtained are in good agreement with the data reported in [22,30].\n2.2.2. MEP Analysis\nIn [50\u201352], the MEP was considered as a fundamental factor that determines the nature and behavior of atoms and molecules and their ability for intermolecular interactions. In studies [53,54] aimed at finding the interplay between the experimentally observed properties and the electronic characteristics of particles obtained in the quantum-chemical calculation, the MEP properties were successfully used. The electrostatic potential map is plotted, as a rule, on the particle surface corresponding to an electron density contour close to the boundaries specified by the van der Waals radii. Local values of the total electrostatic potential are used to describe the properties, including the potential ability of particles to be involved in intermolecular interactions. The MEP analysis is related to the electron density and allows one to establish positions of the electrophilic and nucleophilic attacks and hydrogen bond interactions [55].\nThe obtained MEP and its contours are shown in Figures 7 and 8, respectively.\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 21 of 36\nAccording to the data listed in Table 7, the E(RB3LYP) value changes almost uniformly from \u2212962.23145 to \u22121638.1316 a.u. when the content of urea molecules in the ammonium sulfamate\u2013urea system changes from one to four.

In general, as compared with the data from [30], more intermolecular interactions were revealed by the QTAIM calculation because of the presence of an additional ammonium cation. At the same time, the interaction energy is of the same order of magnitude and ranges from \u22123 to \u221267 kJ/mol, which allows us to speak about the similar nature of the interaction. The stability of a molecular structure can be aided by molecular interactions; weak intra- or intermolecular interactions can be determined using the RDG calculation based on the analysis of noncovalent interactions (NCIs) [59]. The visual approach known as the RDG analysis is used to make the NCIs more specific and explore intra- and inter-molecular interactions in a molecular system [60]. The RDG function is a fundamental dimensionless quantity for describing the deviation from the uniform electron distribution, which is calculated using the formula [61].\nRDG(r) = 1 2(3\u03c02)1/3 |\u2207\u03c1(r)| \u03c1(r)4/3\n(1)\nThe RDG scatter plot versus sign of the second eigenvalue (\u03bb2)\u03c1 of the electron density provides information about the strength and nature of the interactions. The (\u03bb2)\u03c1 value and sign are used to explain the nature of the interactions; (\u03bb2)\u03c1 > 0 corresponds to the repulsive interaction and (\u03bb2)\u03c1 < 0, to the attractive ones; in the case of the van der Waals interactions, (\u03bb2)\u03c1 is close to zero [62]. The \u03bb2(r) function ranges from \u22120.030 to 0.020 a.u. in the RDG scattering spectra, which are divided into three colors: red, green, and blue. The red peak on the RDG isosurfaces shows the steric repulsion. The RDG scatter plot contains a red contour between 0.02 and 0.05 a.u., which points out the higher contribution of the repulsive exchange. The blue peak is indicative of the strong attraction between the ammonium cation and the urea molecule or the ammonium cation and the sulfo group of ammonium sulfamate and the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The blue contour in the RDG scatterplot between \u22120.05 and \u22120.03 a.u. points out the presence of a hydrogen bond, which is confirmed also by the effective interaction parameter \u03c7. It should be noted that, with an increase in the number of urea molecules, the blue region on the RDG isosurfaces grows. The mixed red-green peaks are observed near the interactions of the ammonium cation with the secondary oxygen atom of the sulfo group of ammonium sulfamate. The gradient scatter graphs (RDG) and non-covalent interactions (NCI) for the investigated system are plotted in Figure 10. The ELF maps highlight zones of molecular space; the maps of their color shades are shown in Figure 11. This topological surface analysis is based on covalent bonds, in which the electron pair detection is high. The ELF calculation takes into account the kinetic energy density [63,64].\nMolecules 2023, 28, 470 24 of 33Molecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 25 of 36\nMolecules 2023, 28, 470 25 of 33Molecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 27 of 36\nMolecules 2023, 28, 470 26 of 33\nThe ELF value \u03c4(r) ranges from 0.0 to 1.0; relatively full values of 0.5 and 1.0 correspond to the contours containing localized bonding and nonbonding electrons [62]. The low (<0.5) values correspond to the contours in which electrons should be delocalized [65]. Figure 11 shows the high ELF regions around hydrogen atoms, which are indicative of the presence of highly localized bonding and nonbonding electrons, and the blue regions around several oxygen and nitrogen atoms show a delocalized electron cloud around them."

            "text": "For the first time, the ammonium sulfamate\u2013urea binary system with different component ratios was studied comprehensively. It was shown with FTIR spectroscopy that this system remains stable at temperatures of up to 100 \u25e6C for up to 30 min without forming new chemical bonds. It was demonstrated using the X-ray diffraction analysis that temperatures below 100 \u25e6C and a time of 30 min barely affect the crystal structure of the system. The impact of temperature on the state of aggregation of the ammonium sulfamate\u2013urea system with different component ratios was determined using the thermal analysis and melting point data. Theoretical methods were used to find the parameter of the effective interaction of the system, which indicates a strong attraction of molecules in it. The blue RDG contour between \u22120.05 and \u22120.03 a.u. pointed out the presence of a hydrogen bond, which was confirmed also by the effective interaction parameter \u03c7. Using DFT methods, the molecular structures of the systems with different component ratios were optimized. The spectroscopy characteristics of the ammonium sulfamate\u2013urea system with different component ratios were theoretically established. The ADMP calculation of the ammonium sulfamate\u2013urea system at temperatures of 100, 300, and 500 K showed that, at all the investigated ratios, the potential energy (curve amplitude) change increases regularly with an increase in temperature from 100 to 500 K.
