ABSTRACT Introduction Most of the global noncommunicable disease (NCD)related death burden is borne by low and middleincome countries (LMICs). In LMICs like Pakistan, however, a major gap in responding to NCDs is a lack of highquality research leading to policy development and implementation of NCDs. To assess institutional opportunities and constraints to NCD research and training we conducted a situational analysis for NCD research and training at Aga Khan University Pakistan. Methods We conducted a descriptive exploratory study using grounded theory as a qualitative approach: semistructured interviews of 16 NCD stakeholders (three excluded) and two focus group discussions with postgraduate and undergraduate trainees were conducted. A simple thematic analysis was done where themes were identified, and then recurring ideas were critically placed in their specific themes and refined based on the consensus of the investigators. Results The major themes derived were priority research areas in NCDs; methods to improve NCD research integration; barriers to NCD research in LMICs like Pakistan; design of NCD research programme and career paths; and NCD prevention at mass level, policy and link to the government. In general, participants opined that while there was an appetite for NCD research and training, but few highquality research training programmes in NCDs existed, such programmes needed to be established. The ideal NCD research and training programmes would have inbuilt protected time, career guidance and dedicated mentorship. Most participants identified cardiovascular diseases as a priority thematic area and health information technology and data science as key methodological approaches to be introduced into research training. Conclusion We conclude from this qualitative study on NCD research and training that highquality research training programmes for NCDs are rare. Such programmes need to be established with inbuilt protected time, career guidance and mentorship for the trainees to improve their research capacity in Pakistan. INTRODUCTION With global industrialisation and consequent lifestyle changes, noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) now account for 72% of global deaths. Most of the NCDrelated death burden is borne by low and middleincome countries (LMIC). NCDs have deep economic and societal consequences and thus their rising burden, especially in fragile LMICs, is alarming. In Pakistan, an LMIC with a population of over 220 million and with a total health expenditure of 2.6% of the gross domestic product (GDP), NCDs now account for >50% of mortality among adults. Four NCDs including cancers, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes account for the most NCD mortality. Projection models derived from Global Burden of Disease 2010 data predict that there will be about 3.87 million premature deaths by 2025 from CVDs, cancers and STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY",

Interestingly, CVDs constitute a substantial proportion of projected deaths by 2025 in this analysis. In a bibliometric analysis of NCDs in LMICs, only 9% were published from countries in South Asia and only 1.7% from Pakistan.6 Also, presumably another reason for the lack of NCD data from LMICs could be a large amount of thesis work that never makes it to publication in indexed journals. More specifically to CVDs, we have shown in a bibliometric analysis over 10 years, LMICs contributed only 2.8% of the total research output.7 Pakistan as an LMIC also resembles social and human development indicators with other LMICs on the globe and NCD- related challenges are likely to be similar.8 (Table 1 shows a comparison of social indicators and human development indices of Pakistan with other lower middle- income countries.)\nAccording to the WHO NCD fact sheet for Pakistan, many NCD global action plan indicators either lack data or all goals of the action plan have not been met. A major gap in Pakistan\u2019s response to the NCD epidemic is a lack of a high- quality research workforce that could subsequently advise the government in prioritising, policy development and implementation of NCD prevention programmes.9 This is also demonstrated by the lack of budgetary resources allocated to primary and secondary\nprevention of NCDs.10 At present, provincial governments are the single largest institutional entity spending on health but most of this goes towards curative care, and the health system cannot allocate funds for NCD prevention and control.11 The package of essential NCD interventions for primary healthcare in low- resource settings from WHO has also faced implementation challenges.12 While inadequate research capacity is a pervasive, crossdisciplinary problem, understanding specific barriers and opportunities to develop NCD research capacity is necessary and foundational to endeavours aiming to build the capacity of a high- quality research workforce in Pakistan. To assess institutional opportunities and constraints to NCD research and NCD research and training we conducted a situational analysis for NCD research and training at Aga Khan University (AKU) Pakistan."

Additionally, we also invited policymakers and government officials, health and social service providers, NGOs and private businesses. Those who had at least five publications on NCD or were supervising master\u2019s students in NCD research or junior faculty with community- based research projects with a focus on NCD were considered NCD researchers. A sample of 10\u201315 participants were determined to explore the capacity for NCD research and training. The purposive sampling method was used to include stakeholders using a framework described by Schiller et al.16 Written informed consent was obtained from all participants who were interviewed at the start of the study. For the FGD, an email invitation was sent to the group of house staff, but individual informed consent was not obtained.\nData collection tool The semistructured interviews comprised open- ended questions and were focused on the following areas: priority NCD research areas; gaps in NCD research within the organisation\u2019s governance and administrative resources; factors that enable or impede implementation of an NCD training programme; opportunities for integration of NCD research in clinical hospital- based and\noutreach programmes, and existing non- NCD research programmes; barriers to trainee retention at AKU and Pakistan; barriers to translating research to policy and practice; type of research training programme (master\u2019s, PhD or research course) feasible for trainees; and methods to attract trainees towards a research training programme. We used the WHO definition for NCDs: \u2018NCDs are chronic diseases mainly including CVDs, cancers, diabetes, and chronic lung diseases\u2019. Additionally, we also included their risk factors.17 Semistructured study guides were pretested by the study team on two individuals who were not study participants. The study guide was developed and administered in English.\nFocus group discussion All postgraduates in the final year of training and medical students with an interest in NCD research as a career were invited to participate. A sample of approximately 10\u201314 (five to seven in each group) participants were determined to explore the perceptions of NCD research and training.18 Purposive sampling technique was used. A semistructured interview guide was used to conduct the FGD comprising three open- ended questions on the preference of clinical training over research as a career, opportunities, barriers on becoming an active NCD researcher and the kind of research training that suits them best.\nStudy procedures A total of 16 NCD stakeholders were invited to participate in the study. Once the stakeholders agreed to participate in the study, informed consent was obtained, and interviews were arranged. In total, 16 semistructured interviews were conducted as data reached saturation after 16 interviews and no added information, but only repetition of information was evident (one interview was incomplete and hence was not included). To maintain gender equity, nine men and seven women were interviewed. Each interview was of a 1- hour duration and was conducted by at least one primary investigator (PI) and a coordinator in a seminar room in the Department of Medicine or in offices of stakeholders where confidentiality could be maintained. The PI has an interest in NCDs and is a practising internist with a master\u2019s and doctoral research degree and did not have a direct reporting relationship with any of the study participants. Interviews were only voice recorded once permission for recording was obtained from participants and field notes were minimally used to aid the response to various questions in the semistructured interview. The PI had the required knowledge and research skills to perform the interviews. The coordinator ensured that all responses and comments by the stakeholders were recorded in an unbiased and uninterrupted way during the interview process. This was done to ensure reflexivity (more effective and impartial analysis) at the researcher\u2019s end (online supplemental table A: strategies to achieve rigour).

There is no dedicated training to conduct research at the undergraduate or postgraduate level in public sector medical universities. The research conducted by postgraduate medical trainees as part of their mandatory requirement for appearing in exit examinations is not of high quality. National- level academic organisations like the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan and the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Pakistan need to collaborate to build capacity in research in general and specifically NCD. Such training needs to\nbe organised both for trainees and the trainers or supervisors. Simultaneously, there is a dearth of high- quality, international- level research training in Pakistan. Most universities offer master\u2019s in public health, but the quality of graduates sometimes does not translate into independent research. There is also a need to develop a diseasespecific curriculum in epidemiology and NCD- specific courses. Also, there is a lack of coordination between apex tertiary care facilities and peripheral or basic health units (BHU; primary care). The BHUs can serve as a unit for NCD prevention by providing health services as well as data generation. There is a need to develop linkages with international organisations to promote the NCD research and training agenda in the right direction. A male, distinguished neurology researcher (ID_01) noted:\nNo centralized data system exists. These clinical centers are primarily designed for services. There is a need to develop an IT infrastructure between Afghanistan and other AKU centers through Aga Khan Development Network.\nParticipants also stated that there were no organised NCD prevention programmes led by the government\nFigure 1 Themes and subthemes developed from the semistructured interviews.

A male lead from an NGO (ID_06) noted:\nHealth is not a priority area for our governments.\nAn early career public health researcher from a public health institute (ID_06) stated:\nThe government should not only facilitate research training but also allocate small grants for trainees of Master level which can be utilized for NCD research in a transparent fashion.\nRoadblocks to NCD research and training in Pakistan Participants listed several barriers to NCD research and training in Pakistan. First, they indicated that few quality research training programmes exist, and these often have expensive tuition fees. Funding to attend these programmes becomes a challenge and is a major barrier for healthcare professionals to become trained in various research fields. There is a gap in commitment towards NCD research between researchers and policymakers. However, with the advent of the COVID- 19 pandemic, this gap has reduced to some extent as reflected by the success of policies implemented by the National Command and Operation Center of Pakistan, clinical trials conducted over a brief period and changes in hospital infrastructure according to the demand of the pandemic. Second, healthcare professionals are hesitant to pursue a career in research as it has slower career progression and poor monetary remuneration compared with building a successful clinical practice. Third, participants felt that there was a lack of invested mentorship for trainees and early career researchers. The lack of individuals with expertise in quantitative research methods (eg, with master\u2019s and PhDs in the research field) was reported as a barrier. Additional barriers included a lack of protected time for research for those who do acquire formal research training and subsequently struggle to achieve success as independent researchers. Participants also pointed out that cumbersome research administrative processes and insufficient research administrative staff further add to the stagnancy in research culture. A distinguished male neurology researcher (ID_01) stated:\nLack of training and funding opportunities, research career does not have any compensation model for research.\nNCD research as a career path in future Overall, the participants agreed that there is a lot of potential in developing a career in NCD, if there are suitable research training programmes, as Pakistan faces a heavy burden on NCDs. Most participants considered master\u2019s in a research area such as epidemiology and biostatistics or health policy and management as a feasible programme option for healthcare professionals. They suggested introducing postgraduate clinical programmes that have a built- in master\u2019s programme within them. Some\nparticipants, however, thought that long- term training such as PhD is especially important and having a cadre of PhD trained researchers is critical to furthering the long- term thematic research agenda for any university. Some participants also suggested that short- term research courses were also an alternate feasible solution. Better mentorship in research for trainees so they can pursue an independent research career is required to improve their research capacity. A female senior researcher (ID_04) with experience in implementing training grants suggested:\nOffering them a structured research program within and during clinical training might be best suited.\nIt was suggested that more seed grant funding opportunities are needed to facilitate early career researchers.\nNCD prevention priority as a policy at the government level Most participants thought that an important reason behind the population- level NCD prevention agenda never gaining attraction in Pakistan was the lack of coordination between the NCD researchers and the government. Most participants felt that this connection needs to be improved by creating national- level bodies with stakeholders from the government, health sector and corporate sector. Better data needed to be generated and provided to policymakers. This could be derived from establishing community- based surveillance sites using public\u2013private partnership models, using existing large governmental administrative data sets and leveraging other ubiquitous \u2018big data\u2019 resources. Participants felt that an often underemphasised yet important aspect of the research to policy link was the timely and comprehensive dissemination of research results. Participants felt that research results shared with the public using print and social media need to be highlighted. Research monitoring and evaluation systems are not sufficient in government institutions, while routine health information systems are also inadequate. There is a lack of interest and awareness about the dissemination and promotion of research results. There is a need to develop and improve a primary healthcare system in the country by strengthening the BHU system. Government hospitals and BHU should be connected through an information technology (IT)- based server. Additionally, postgraduate trainees should be given the chance to work for 1 month at BHU to improve community services. We need to develop facilities in BHUs, such as providing NCD preventive services."

Also, a few international funding agencies such as the National Institutes of Health- Fogarty, Wellcome Trust UK and International Diabetes Federation have funded NCDbased projects in Pakistan.34\u201337 But more national and international funding bodies need to reprioritise funding for NCD research based on public health needs.5\nBarriers to the development of such a skilled NCD research workforce highlighted in our study included lack of high- quality research training programmes, resources and facilitatory career pathways for NCD researchers. We found that while there was a great appetite for such training, potential trainees and experts felt that there was a dearth of high- quality training programmes and systemic support structures necessary for the long- term career success of NCD researchers. But at the same time, many opportunities and ideas to address these barriers were also highlighted. Previous work has shown that there are low numbers of competent researchers in LMICs.38 This is true for Pakistan too where a substantial increase in the number of medical graduates and postgraduates over the past few decades has not translated into more researchers or clinician- scientists. High- quality research training programmes for undergraduates and postgraduates are limited which is why there are few clinical scientists from Pakistan. Previously proposed solutions included strengthening \u2018in- house\u2019 research training to increase local capacity and reduce the \u2018brain drain\u2019 in Pakistan; strengthening research training programmes and developing schools of public health to develop health professionals: educators, practitioners and researchers who have critical thinking and research local solutions to fundamental health problems in LMICs.30 39 40\nCareer pathways that are defined, with adequate protected time, and invested mentorship are important ingredients to developing research careers. In a study that assessed 294 medical students in Pakistan, only 19.4% of the participants thought that they would choose research as a career.41 Important barriers cited included\nlack of protected time and mentorship. Lack of mentorship was also found to be an important barrier to understanding and pursuing research career paths in a study on postgraduates.42\u201344 It is known that mentorship early in one\u2019s career results in more productivity in terms of publishing, obtaining funding and transitioning to leadership. Similar challenges were reported through the focused group discussions with undergraduate and postgraduate students from this study including a lack in culture of mentorship and a dearth of clinical scientists who could serve as mentors. This highlights the urgent need for quality research training with in- built mentorship programmes that can develop a cadre of NCD researchers to serve as mentors in the future. In addition, structured mentoring individual career development frameworks need to be developed with institutional and facilitatory policies from the government; these include attractive compensation models for researchers, time protection, especially for early career researchers, and funded positions in leadership.30 45 46 Building a cadre of NCD researchers will contribute to the development of much- needed contextual and relevant evidence necessary to guide and implement effective local solutions and fill the data to policy gap.\nOur findings highlight the need to develop a menu of short, medium and long- term NCD research and training programmes tailored to the needs of different healthcare professionals at different career levels. Additionally, such programmes should have the flexibility for those pursuing clinical training.\nFrom a research method standpoint, IT and data science were areas that were highlighted as opportunities by participants. Digitised information acquired as a by- product of clinical care, the government- maintained administrative data sets and digital online footprints represent untapped opportunities for NCD surveillance and targeting risk- mitigating interventions in Pakistan. This approach would also capitalise on a robust historical investment in IT.21 25 47\u201351\nOur study generates new knowledge and highlights important addressable barriers and opportunities that if fully leveraged will lay down the foundation of a future robust NCD training programme at leading institutions in Pakistan that have the necessary infrastructure to train the next generation of NCD researchers. The long- term sustainability of such programmes requires government support and investment. Also, these findings serve as a guide map for other LMICs that face a similar challenge in tackling the NCD burden, in developing research career paths in NCDs. We also call on international funding agencies like the Gates Foundation, Medical Research Council, National Institutes of Health, Wellcome Trust and others to support NCD projects in Pakistan.\nThe strength of this study is that it highlights NCD research and training using in- depth interviews with experts while supplementing it with focused group discussion from novice trainees interested in NCD research.

Second, while researchers from different fields were included, only one policymaker and one NGO representative were interviewed for the study which could have affected the diversity of opinions. Third, no patient was interviewed as a stakeholder, which could have limited the findings to a predefined educated group of researchers, and the number of FGDs was minimum. Additionally, the findings are limited to NCD research in an urban setting from an LMIC; however, based on the similarity of the social and human development indicators of Pakistan with other LMICs, the findings can be reflective of these countries as well. While the study fulfilled most criteria to achieve rigour, peer debriefing was not done which is a limitation of the study."

Additionally, strong networking mechanisms between NCD researchers, policymakers and government need to be facilitated to prioritise NCD research.\nAuthor affiliations 1Department of Medicine, Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan 2Department of Medicine, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, USA 3Global health, Duke university, Durhum, North Carolina, USA 4Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan 5Community Health Sciences Department, Aga Khan University Medical College, Karachi, Pakistan 6Division of Women and Child Health, Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan 7Global Child Health, Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada 8Duke Clinical Research Institute, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, USA 9Department of Medicine and Global Health, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, USA 10Health Services & Systems Research Programme, Duke- NUS Medical School, Singapore 11Department of Global Health, Duke University, Durhum, North Carolina, USA\nTwitter Aysha Almas @drayshaalmas and Tazeen H Jafar @COBRAStudy\nAcknowledgements We thank all the study participants who gave their invaluable time in conducting this study.\nContributors ZS and AA designed the study and participated in getting ethical approvals, study implementation and writing the first draft.
