conclusions In this paper, we analyzed the inter-user interference in the new mixed near- and far-field communication scenario. Specifically, we first obtained a closed-form expression for the normalized interference power at the NU caused by the FU beam, based
on which, the effects of the number of BS antennas, FU angle, NU angle and distance were analyzed. Moreover, the explicit rate-loss expression caused by the FU interference was obtained, which was verified by numerical results.
