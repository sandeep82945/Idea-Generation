    "abstractText": "Low-molecular-weight peptide gelators are a versatile class of compounds able to form gels under a variety of conditions, even via simple ultrasound sonication. In this paper, the ability of Boc-L-Phe-D-Oxd-L-Phe-OBn to gelate three organic solvents (toluene, tert-butyl methyl ether, and ethanol) was evaluated. The rheological behaviour of the materials was assessed via strain sweep analysis, while the fibrous network was analysed via optical microscopy on the wet gels. The gel obtained from toluene is a highly transparent material, and the one from ethanol appears translucent, while the one from tert-butyl methyl ether is opaque. These gels were used to study the reversible light-induced transformation from spyropiran (SP) to merocyanine (MC) and back, as a model system to check the effect of the gel medium onto the rection kinetic. We observed that the solvent used to form the organogels has a crucial effect on the reaction, as gels from aprotic solvents stabilize the SP form, while the ones from protic solvents stabilize the MC form. We thus obtained a solid support to stabilize the two photochromic species just by changing the solvent polarity. Moreover, we could demonstrate that the self-assembled gels do not interfere with the light-driven conversion process, either starting from SP or MC, thus representing a valid and economical photochromic material.",

            "text": "Low-molecular-weight (LMW) gels are a class of soft materials comprising a fibrous network which entraps a solvent [1,2]. The network is formed by LMW gelators, molecules of reduced size, usually lower than 1000 Da, able to self-assemble through non-covalent interactions, such as hydrogen and halogen bonds [3\u20137], aromatic \u03c0-stackings [8,9], and hydrophobic interactions [10,11]. Peptides are an important class of LMW gelators, because they can self-assemble through a variety of weak interactions, they can be efficiently synthesised, and they facilitate the preparation of materials that are often biocompatible and biodegradable [5,12\u201315]. The self-assembly process is usually induced by the application of a trigger, which alters the solubility of the molecules [3\u20137]. The trigger can be chosen among several physical and chemical inputs (light, temperature, ultrasound sonication, pH, enzymes, salts), and its nature has a huge impact on the final properties of the obtained material [16\u201319]. The self-assembly of peptide gelators leads to the formation of fibres, usually possessing a \u03b2-sheet secondary structure [20\u201322], which entangle together and entrap the solvent. Being composed of weak interactions, these fibres are usually easy to break and reform (reversible gels) [12,23], and the gel formation can be easily tuned [24]. For this reason, LMW gels are useful for several applications, as water decontamination [25\u201330], optical sensors [31,32], template synthesis (crystals, nanostructures) [33\u201335], cell growth [36,37], drug delivery, and release of compounds [38\u201342]. The solvent of these materials can, in turn, be water for hydrogels, or an organic solvent for organogels [43\u201346], that can be formed through exposure to ultrasound sonication [11,26]\nGels 2023, 9, 932. https://doi.org/10.3390/gels9120932 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/gels\nGels 2023, 9, 932 2 of 13\nor temperature variation [14,47], often using terminally protected peptides [48,49]. LMW gels are also able to incorporate a variety of species that would not be soluble in the solvent itself. This property can be used to trap photochromic compounds inside a gel, to explore the behaviour of smart materials responding to light in this medium. Photochromism is a light-induced phenomenon, which causes the reversible transformation of a species between two forms with different absorption spectra, thus different colours [50,51]. There are many examples of photochromic compounds [52\u201356], such as azo dyes, spiro-derivatives (spiropyran and spironaphthoxazine), naphthopyrans, quinones, stilbenes, viologens, and diarylethene compounds, possessing different isomers, converting one into the other by changing the wavelength of irradiation. The possibility to transferring the properties of these compounds from solution to solid phase is an interesting topic, as it leads to the preparation of smart materials able to reversibly change optical properties [56\u201359]. Many photochromic compounds such as spiropyrans [60\u201366] were inserted into supramolecular gels, conferring new properties to the functionalized materials. The spiropyran unit (SP) is one of the most studied photochromic compounds [67] for its ability to respond to multiple stimuli, such as light, pH, temperature, and ions, and proved to be a suitable candidate to confer reversible properties to supramolecular gels [68\u201371]. In this work, we present the application of a previously reported organogelator [72] that was chosen as it forms transparent organogels with several solvents, thus allowing a large part of visible light to pass through them. We synthesised a SP that can be converted into its merocyanine (MC) form upon UV irradiation (Scheme 1). The reaction occurs through the formation of a cis-merocyanine (c-MC), a transient intermediate that isomerises to produce MC when irradiated with UV light, or closes to generate SP when irradiated with visible light. The SP was inserted into the gels prepared with different solvents, and we demonstrated that the SP/MC reaction reversibly occurs both in supramolecular gels and in the solution, being very sensitive to the solvent medium.\nGels 2023, 9, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 14\noptical sensors [31,32], template synthesis (crystals, nanostructures) [33\u201335], cell growth\n[36,37], drug delivery, and release of compounds [38\u201342].\nThe solvent of these materials can, in turn, be water for hydrogels, or an organic sol-\nvent for organogels [43\u201346], that can be formed through exposure to ultrasound sonication\n[11,26] or temperature variation [14,47], often using terminally protected peptides [48,49].\nLMW gels are also able to incorporate a variety of species that would not be soluble in the\nsolvent itself.

The formation of all these functionalized organogels was not hampered by the presence of the two light-responsive compounds. The properties of the new gels were studied by strain sweep analysis, under the above reported conditions (Figure S2). As depicted in the graph reported in Figure 4, organogels of toluene and TBME containing either the SP or the MC are weaker compared to the gels containing only the gelator, while the opposite phenomenon occurs in the case of ethanol. However, the differences are small, as the stiffness is in the same order of magnitude of the gels without either of the molecules, ranging between 3.52 and 12.3 kPa. Another piece of information necessary to study the formation of the fibres which constitute the gel is obtained via the analysis of the IR spectra of the wet organogels prepared in 1% w/w concentration (Figure S4). The stretching bands of NH groups in the aprotic solvents (toluene and TBME) are located at 3339 and 3336 cm\u22121, respectively. This is the typical position of the NH groups that are involved in hydrogen bonding, requested to form the supramolecular fibres. Unfortunately, the NH stretching band in the ethanol organogel is not visible as it is covered by the overwhelming signal of the OH group. Then, the effect of the three media on the equilibrium among SP and MC was studied both in the solutions and in the gels. First, we prepared three solutions of the product in the three solvents in 5 mg/mL concentration. The solutions in toluene and TBME are yellow,\nGels 2023, 9, 932 5 of 13\nindicating that the equilibrium in these solvents privileged the SP form. In contrast, the ethanol solution is red, suggesting that in this case the MC form is preferred [82]. These results agree with the different polarity of the solvents: aprotic solvents stabilise the SP structure, while the protic solvent stabilises the zwitterionic MC form.\nGels 2023, 9, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 14\nto the gels containing only the gelator, while the opposite phenomenon occurs in the ca\nof ethanol.

After this time, each solution reconverted to the starting point (Figure 5), thus confirming that the protic solvents stabilize MC, while aprotic solvents stabilize SP. To check if the solvent stabilization effect prevails also in organogels, the experiment was repeated by including SP or MC in the three gels, preparing two samples of each organogel. For this purpose, the gelator (1% w/v concentration) and SP (5 w/v concentration) were dissolved in the three solvents.

Unfortunately, we could not compare the UV-vis absorption spectra of the SP form in the gel and solution because the signal of the gelator covered the one of the SPs in the region below 400 nm (Figure 7a\u2013c).\nFigure 6.

            "text": "In this work, we prepared three organogels obtained from organic solvents of different polarity (toluene, TBME, and ethanol) and the gelator Boc-L-Phe-D-Oxd-L-Phe-OBn in 1% w/v concentration. The organogels were characterized in terms of rheological, morphological, and optical properties. These materials are highly transparent, and their transparency increases from TMBE, to ethanol to toluene, the last being highly transparent (transmittance of 99.2% at 630 nm). To apply this remarkable property, the gels were used to study the light-catalysed conversion between spiropyran and merocyanine, which are photochromic compounds. The presence of these light-sensitive species has no impact on the gelation ability of the gelator and a reduced impact on the final rheological properties of the materials, leaving mostly unaltered their stiffness, breaking point, and linear viscoelastic range. Moreover, the photochromic compounds always behave in the gel matrix as in solution, interconverting to the most stable form, that is, SP for aprotic solvents, and MC for protic solvents. Finally, the interconversion follows the same kinetics both in the gel and in the solution, as the use of a transparent gel does not interfere with the medium irradiation, both with UV and with visible light. We demonstrated that the organogels presented in this work are transparent smart materials that are good candidates to host photochromic compounds, as they never hinder the reversible interconversion between the SP and MC forms, while acting as solid and economic supports."

Gels of Boc-L-Phe-D-Oxd-L-Phe-OBn were prepared in 1% w/v concentration (10 mg/mL) of gelator in a glass test tube (diameter = 16 mm) with fresh solvents in a total volume of 2.5 mL. The mixture was sonicated for 20 min until a homogeneous phase was obtained, and then the samples were left to rest overnight to allow complete gel formation. Formation of Gels containing SP or MC. SP and MC solutions in 5 mg/mL concentration were freshly prepared by swirling the solid in toluene, TBME or ethanol. SP and MC solutions in 0.05 mg/mL concentration were prepared via dilution of the 5 mg/mL solutions with fresh solvent. Gels containing SP or MC for rheological analysis were prepared with the gelator in 1% w/v concentration (10 mg/mL) and either SP or MC in 0.5% w/v concentration (5 mg/mL) in a total volume of 2.5 mL. The mixture was sonicated for 20 min until a homogeneous phase was obtained, then the samples were left to rest overnight to allow complete gel formation. Gels containing SP or MC for spectrophotometric analysis were prepared with the gelator in 1% w/v concentration (10 mg/mL) and either SP or MC in 0.005% w/v concentration (0.05 mg/mL) in a total volume of 1.5 mL. The mixture was sonicated for 15 min until\nGels 2023, 9, 932 9 of 13\na homogeneous phase was obtained, and then it was pipetted in a quartz cuvette (path length 5.0 mm), sonicated for additional 5 min, and left to rest overnight to allow complete gel formation. Gels containing SP were prepared by pouring the solution of SP irradiated with white light (300 W) to ensure complete conversion, on the solid gelator. Then, the solutions were sonicated maintaining the visible irradiation with a LED lamp (2 W), and as they were removed from the sonicating bath, they were wrapped in aluminium foil to mimic dark conditions and left to rest overnight. Gels containing MC were prepared in the same way, replacing the use of white light with the use of UV light (365 nm, 10 W). All gels were prepared using an Elma (Singen, Germany) Elmasonic S 30 H ultrasound sonicator (37 kHz). Optical microscopy. The images were recorded using a Nikon (Tokyo, Japan) A1R optical microscope and a 40\u00d7magnifier. Gels used for optical microscopy were prepared as described, and then a small piece of the gel was transferred onto a glass microscope slide and gently covered with a cover slip. Rheology. All rheological measurements were performed using an Anton Paar (Graz, Austria) MCR102 rheometer. A vane and cup measuring system was used, setting a gap of 2.1 mm. The gels were prepared as described and tested directly in the glass test tube (diameter = 16 mm). Oscillatory amplitude sweep experiments (\u03b3: 0.01\u2013100%) were performed at a fixed temperature of 23 \u25e6C, controlled using an integrated Peltier system, using a constant angular frequency (\u03c9) of 10 rad/s. All analyses were performed after 16 h from the removal of the gel solution from the sonication bath, to allow a complete gel formation, and repeated in triplicate. Spectrophotometric characterization. Gels used for probing the transparency of the gels media were prepared as described, by using 1.5 mL of the homogeneous phase containing 1.0% w/v of 1 in the solvent chosen. Then, this amount was transferred in a quartz cuvette (path length 5.0 mm) during sonication before gelation occurred, and left to rest overnight to allow complete gel formation. Solutions of SP and MC were prepared by dissolving 0.05 mg/mL of SP in the required solvent and irradiating it with either white (300 W) or UV (365 nm) light, respectively, for 1 min to ensure complete conversion to the needed specimen. Gels used for studying the conversion from SP to MC, and vice versa, were prepared in the same way, replacing the fresh solvent with a 0.05 mg/mL solution of either SP or MC in the required solvent. The SP solution was obtained after irradiation with white light (300 W), and the MC solution was obtained after irradiation with UV light (365 nm).\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/gels9120932/s1, Figure S1: Photograph of the MGC study for the three solvents; Table S1: Transparency calculation starting from the spectrophotometric analysis in Figure 3a; Figure S2: Photograph of the cup and vane geometry adopted for the rheological experiments; Figure S3: Strain sweep experiments of the gels in toluene, TBME, and ethanol, each containing SP or MC in 0.5 w/v concentration; Figure S4: FT-IR spectra of the organogels obtained in 1% w/v concentration in toluene (top), TBME (middle) and ethanol (bottom); Figure S5: Normalised UV-vis absorption spectra over time of solutions and gels containing SP in 0.005 w/v concentration; Figure S6: Normalised UV-vis absorption spectra over time of solutions and gels containing MC in 0.005 w/v concentration.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, P.R. and C.T.; methodology, P.R.; validation, D.G. and P.R.; formal analysis, D.G.; investigation, P.R.; resources, C.T.; data curation, D.G.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, D.G. and C.T.; writing\u2014review and editing, D.G. and C.T.; supervision, C.T.; project administration, D.G.; funding acquisition, C.T.
