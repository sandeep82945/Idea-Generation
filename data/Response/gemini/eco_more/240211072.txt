1. **Investigate the role of uncertainty and new information on choice reversal.** The paper suggests that uncertainty and new information may affect choice reversal, but this has not been fully explored. Future research could examine how these factors influence the demand for commitment and flexibility devices.
2. **Measure the value of implicitly welfare loss.** The paper acknowledges that the value of implicitly welfare loss is not measured in the model. Future research could develop a method to measure this value and explore how it affects the demand for commitment and flexibility devices.
3. **Examine the effect of temptation on preferences for commitment.** The paper suggests that temptation may affect preferences for commitment, but this has not been fully explored. Future research could examine how temptation influences the demand for commitment devices and the welfare implications of these devices.
4. **Develop a model that incorporates both time-consistent and time-inconsistent preferences.** The paper uses a time-inconsistent discounting model to measure awareness of self-control problems. Future research could develop a model that incorporates both time-consistent and time-inconsistent preferences to explore how these preferences interact and affect the demand for commitment and flexibility devices.
5. **Test the model in different populations.** The paper tests the model in a sample of students. Future research could test the model in different populations, such as older adults, people with low incomes, or people with mental health conditions, to explore how the demand for commitment and flexibility devices varies across different groups.
