Entity linking aims to link ambiguous mentions to their corresponding entities in a knowledge base. One of the key challenges comes from insufficient labeled data for specific domains. Although dense retrievers have achieved excellent performance on several benchmarks, their performance decreases significantly when only a limited amount of in-domain labeled data is available. In such few-shot setting, we revisit the sparse retrieval method, and propose an ELECTRA-based keyword extractor to denoise the mention context and construct a better query expression. For training the extractor, we propose a distant supervision method to automatically generate training data based on overlapping tokens between mention contexts and entity descriptions. Experimental results on the ZESHEL dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art models by a significant margin across all test domains, showing the effectiveness of keywordenhanced sparse retrieval. Code is available at https://github.com/HITsz-TMG/ Sparse-Retrieval-Fewshot-EL. 1 conclusion In this work, we focus on the first-stage retrieval in few-shot entity linking (EL). Given the significant performance drop in dense retrievers for few-shot scenarios, we revisit the sparse retrieval method and enhance its performance with a keyword extractor. We also propose a distant supervision ap-
proach for automated training data generation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate our methodâ€™s superior performance, with case studies showing denoised context and mention-related keywords.
