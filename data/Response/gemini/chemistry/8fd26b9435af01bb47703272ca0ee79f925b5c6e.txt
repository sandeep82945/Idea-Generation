1. **Investigate the binding affinity of various divalent cations to cardiac troponin C and atrial and ventricular myosin regulatory light chains.** This would help to determine whether these proteins are potential targets for toxic cations and could provide insights into the mechanisms of cation-induced cardiotoxicity.
2. **Examine the effects of different concentrations of divalent cations on myosin ATPase activity.** This would help to determine the potential impact of cation accumulation on muscle function and could provide insights into the mechanisms of cation-induced muscle dysfunction.
3. **Investigate the effects of amino acid substitutions and post-translational modifications on the affinity of EF-hand proteins and other targets for divalent cations.** This would help to determine the potential impact of genetic and environmental factors on cation-induced cardiotoxicity and muscle dysfunction.
4. **Examine the effects of divalent cations on the kinetics of the interaction between myosin and actomyosin.** This would help to determine the potential impact of cation accumulation on muscle contraction and could provide insights into the mechanisms of cation-induced muscle dysfunction.
5. **Investigate the potential therapeutic applications of targeting divalent cation binding to EF-hand proteins and other targets for the treatment of cation-induced cardiotoxicity and muscle dysfunction.** This could lead to the development of new therapies for these conditions.
