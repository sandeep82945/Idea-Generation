    "abstractText": "The reduction of dinitrogen to ammonia catalyzed by nitrogenase involves a complex series of events, including ATP hydrolysis, electron transfer, and activation of metal clusters for N2 reduction. Early evidence shows that an essential part of the mechanism involves transducing information between the nitrogenase component proteins through conformational dynamics. Here, millisecond time-resolved hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry was used to unravel peptide-level protein motion on the time scale of catalysis of Mo-dependent nitrogenase from Azotobacter vinelandii. Normal mode analysis calculations complemented this data, providing insights into the specific signal transduction pathways that relay information across protein interfaces at distances spanning 100 \u00c5. Together, these results show that conformational changes induced by protein docking are rapidly transduced to the active site, suggesting a specific mechanism for activating the metal cofactor in the enzyme active site. https://doi.org/10.1038/s42004-023-01046-6 OPEN",

As a result, research on biological nitrogen fixation is of high agronomic, economic, and environmental significance1. Nitrogenase is responsible for biological nitrogen fixation, catalyzing the reduction of N2 to NH3. There are three evolutionarily related forms of the enzyme, which differ slightly in the composition of their metal-containing prosthetic groups2\u201310. Mo-dependent nitrogenase is the most common and well-studied form. This enzymatic complex has two separable components: the Fe and MoFe proteins. Catalysis is a multi-step process where the rates of the individual steps range from microseconds to milliseconds, making the Mo-dependent nitrogenase relatively slow-turnover enzyme11,12. There is ample evidence from studies over decades that N2 reduction involves association and dissociation of the Fe protein and MoFe protein, during which the P-clusters accept electrons from the Fe protein as an intermediate in the transfer of electrons to the FeMo-cofactors (FeMo-co) active sites where N2 is reduced to NH3 (Fig. 1)2,11,13\u201323. This Fe protein cycle must occur eight times to fulfill the minimum stoichiometry (Eq. 1), where the high energetic cost is attributed to the energy necessary for N2 triple bond activation.\nN2 \u00fe 8e \u00fe 8H\u00fe \u00fe 16MgATP ! 2NH3 \u00feH2 \u00fe 16MgADP\u00fe 16Pi \u00f01\u00de\nHow MgATP binding and hydrolysis within the Fe protein affects the chemistry at the FeMo-co ~30 \u00c5 away remains unclear. Growing evidence indicates long-range conformational changes within the complex are essential to catalysis12,23\u201331. Recent presteady-state kinetic studies uncovered evidence that electron transfer at one \u03b1\u03b2 dimer of the MoFe protein suppresses electron transfer in the other \u03b1\u03b2 dimer through a half-sites cooperativity mechanism12. It was proposed that the half-sites reactivity was imposed through protein conformational changes that allosterically suppress electron transfer in one \u03b1\u03b2 dimer until it is\ncompleted in the other. In support of these conformational controls, graph theory analysis and near-the-equilibrium hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) studies of the mechanical coupling in the nitrogenase complex suggested that largeamplitude correlated motions could enable communications between regions near the active site and the Fe protein within each half and between the two halves of the complex12,32. However, direct biophysical evidence of communication between the Fe protein and the FeMo-co on a catalytically relevant timescale is lacking.\nThis study investigates the solution-phase properties of MoFe protein and MoFe protein:Fe protein using HDX and computationally with normal mode analysis (NMA). HDX and NMA are orthogonal approaches that report on protein dynamics. HDX measures deuterium uptake by the protein backbone, reporting on the stability of the hydrogen bond network and solvent accessibility. HDX adds a temporal component to the dynamics by tracking the exchange rate. NMA describes the dynamics of a protein in thermal equilibrium and allows us to determine the type and magnitude of the correlation between the motion amino acids in the protein (or protein complex in the case of MoFe protein:Fe protein). In summary, NMA provides information on the magnitude and direction of motion, while HDX provides information on the time scale of the dynamics. Herein, we describe millisecond time-resolved HDX-MS studies correlating with pre-steady-state catalytic processes. Coupled with computational simulations, we provide molecular-level insights into how Fe protein alters the stability and dynamics of residues in the first coordination sphere of the FeMo-co in a nucleotide-dependent manner."

Quench-flow experiments allow measuring changes in solvent accessibility and hydrogen bond stability of MoFe protein on a catalytically relevant time scale. Here, HDX-MS was used to measure changes in deuterium uptake in free MoFe protein and the presence of MgATP-bound Fe protein under anaerobic conditions. Pepsin digests of the MoFe protein \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits with a 99% and 100% sequence coverage, respectively. The percent deuterium incorporation (%D) was normalized to the 24-h time point and is reported only for peptides that showed a high confidence deuterium incorporation score in HD Examiner and that were detected in all conditions and time points (37 peptides from the \u03b1 subunit and 26 peptides from the \u03b2 subunit can be found in Supplementary Data 1). A global analysis confirmed that Fe protein-dependent changes to the exchange rates in MoFe protein span the entire time course from pre-steady-state to equilibrium conditions. In addition, the magnitude of the changes in exchange is region-specific (Fig. 2). For example, we looked closely at the exchange pattern for the MoFe protein peptide \u03b2183-192, which, based on the crystal structure of the nitrogenase Fe protein\u2014 MoFe \u03b2,\u03b3-methylene MgATP complex (4WZB), makes contact with Fe protein (BLys170, BArg140 and BArg100). Upon Fe protein binding to the MoFe protein, a significant reduction in % D on the minutes time scale is observed. Another example is MoFe protein peptide \u03b1191-203, which resides close to FeMo-co, the P-cluster, and the Fe protein Switch I region (AGlu68). For this peptide, a nearly two-fold increase in exchange is observed in the presence of MgATP-bound Fe protein at the first four time points, 10-80 msec, consistent with the early stages of the catalytic cycle (pre-steady-state). MoFe protein peptides \u03b1365-372 and \u03b2223-231 highlight regions that change from locally lower levels of exchange to higher upon Fe protein binding. The results in Fig. 2 indicate the presence of widely distributed changes to the HDX rate in MoFe protein upon Fe protein binding, spanning the millisecond to hour time regime. To understand how Fe protein binding alters the environment around FeMo-co, we examined the exchange rate of MoFe protein peptides containing residues in the first coordination sphere of FeMo-co (Fig. 3a, b). HDX shows that MgATP-Fe protein binding causes site-specific, time-dependent changes in protein dynamics in the first coordination sphere of the FeMo-co. For example, in the first 10 msec after Fe protein binding, there was a 20-fold decrease in the exchange rate near Arg359, while other regions experienced insignificant changes (Fig. 3c). At 80 msec (consistent with the end of pre-steady-state) after Fe protein addition, HDX near Arg359 increased by 45-fold, while it decreased by 20-fold near Val70. On the minutes time scale, we also observed Fe protein-dependent changes in the dynamics of the residues surrounding FeMo-co. Changes on this time scale cannot directly be associated with catalysis. Instead, they report on changes in stability and dynamics related to equilibrium\nCOMMUNICATIONS CHEMISTRY | (2023) 6:254 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42004-023-01046-6 | www.nature.com/commschem 3\nmotions. The most sensitive to the presence of Fe protein on this time scale were Arg96 and His195. As a pair, they highlight changes imparted by Fe protein binding and show the specific nature of changes with the peptide containing Arg96, increasing the rate of exchange 15-fold. In contrast, the peptide containing His195 decreases its exchange rate by over 200-fold. These data are consistent with Fe protein binding triggering signal transduction that changes the protein environment surrounding the FeMo-cofactor. In some cases, dynamics increased, and in others, it decreased. Importantly, we observed a distinct timedependence of the changes in the FeMo-co environment from as early as 10 msec (pre-steady-state) to minutes (equilibrium motions) upon Fe protein docking.\nComputational analysis of protein dynamics. Coarse-grained modeling of large-amplitude motion can be used to track protein dynamics and to follow the correlation of amino acid displacements12,23,32,33. Our interest in clarifying communication pathways between the two halves of the nitrogenase complex and changes in protein dynamics revealed by our HDX analysis inspired us to investigate if Fe protein controls the amplitude of motion across the MoFe protein and how the nucleotide state of Fe protein influences that motion in two distinct conformations. Therefore, we completed normal mode analysis (NMA) based on two MoFe protein-Fe protein structural models with different nucleotides bound (4WZB having \u03b2,\u03b3-methylene MgATP and 2AFl bound by MgADP tetrafluoroaluminate). Motions within the MoFe protein tetramer and motion within and between Fe protein dimers are predominantly correlated (see Supplementary Fig. 1). However, the movement between MoFe protein and Fe protein dimers is almost exclusively anti-correlated. Nucleotide binding has a clear impact on protein motion. For example, the \u03b2,\u03b3-methylene MgATP-bound form has greater anti-correlation within MoFe protein (darker shade of blue in specific regions of \u03b12 subunits, dark red box) and more significant correlation between MoFe protein and Fe protein (darker shade of red in the regions of Fe protein, purple boxes). Additionally, the amino acid displacement is not identical when the two halves of the complex are compared (\u03b11\u03b21-A1B1 vs. \u03b12\u03b22-A2B2). This is most obvious\nbetween the corresponding regions of \u03b11 (green box) and \u03b12 subunits (dark red box), independently of Fe protein nucleotide status. Protein regions marked by the green/dark red boxes include the coordination sphere of the FeMo-co binding site, parts of the P-cluster environment, and the Fe protein binding interface.\nDifferences in the covariance matrix on a global level inspired us to look for dynamics at the active site FeMo-co that could be linked to Fe protein binding. To do this, we extracted correlation data for residues in the first coordination sphere of the MoFe-co. The amino acid displacement patterns of \u03b2,\u03b3-methylene MgATPbound Fe protein dynamics with respect to residues Val70, Arg96, His195, Cys275, Arg359, and His442 of the MoFe protein \u03b11 subunit have a complex pattern (Supplementary Fig. 2). While the Fe protein subunit motion is predominantly anti-correlated (negative values in line plots and blue color in the structure) with the first coordination sphere residues of FeMo-co, there are several regions in the Fe protein with positive correlation (positive values in line plots and red color in the structure): Switch I, Switch II, [4Fe-4S] cluster, and the Fe protein/MoFe protein interface (around Arg140 and Lys170). Each of the regions with positive correlation has a distinct function during protein binding and catalysis34\u201338. An asymmetry of the Fe protein subunits is also observed, even though it is a homodimer (magenta asterisks). Despite identical sequences and folds, all four Fe protein subunits have distinct dynamic properties that project an asymmetry in protein dynamics.\nWe next extended the analysis of the Normal Mode data to include the pairs of \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits in MoFe protein with respect to residues coordinating FeMo-co, specifically looking for any indication of asymmetric dynamics between structural halves of the enzyme. On a global scale, the most pronounced example is in the \u03b1 subunits, where residues in \u03b11(72-327) and \u03b12(72-327) regions showed predominantly correlated and anti-correlated protein motion, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 4 red boxes). Asymmetric dynamics also occur between \u03b2 subunits, where yellow and green boxes in Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4 highlight regions with nucleotideindependent (\u03b280-200) and nucleotide-dependent (\u03b2370-470)\n4 COMMUNICATIONS CHEMISTRY | (2023) 6:254 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42004-023-01046-6 | www.nature.com/commschem\nalternating protein motions. In the context of the quaternary structure, \u03b172-327 and \u03b2370-470 regions serve as the P-cluster environment and are involved in the Fe protein/MoFe protein interface, while \u03b280-200 regions form the \u03b11\u03b21/\u03b12\u03b22 interface. The magnitude and correlation of motion also have a nucleotide dependence, as seen by comparing the traces in complexes representing MgATP and MgADP bound states (Supplementary Fig. 3 vs 4, green boxes, and green asterisks). Interestingly, motion at the MgATP/MgADP binding site in Fe protein is independent of nucleotide type (Supplementary Figs 3 and 4, black asterisk).\nFe protein binding changes active site dynamics. The nucleotide-dependent differences in dynamics and the dynamic asymmetry between MoFe protein \u03b11\u03b21 and \u03b12\u03b22 subunits are evident in the first coordination sphere of FeMo-co (Fig. 4a). Motion within \u03b11 FeMo-co is always correlated (only red boxes in the first column of each pair). In contrast, specific sites of anticorrelation emerge in the active site on the opposite side of the complex (blue boxes in the second column of each pair). The pattern is nucleotide type-dependent (except Arg359), with significant asymmetry apparent in the MgATP-bound state. The degree of the asymmetry can be best appreciated when comparing the MgATP-bound state for His195, where 5 out of 6 residues involved in the FeMo-co coordination sphere in the \u03b12 subunit are anti-correlated with their counterparts in the \u03b11 subunit. The second example compares Arg96 and Cys275 and illustrates how ATP hydrolysis induces the asymmetry in protein dynamics between enzyme halves. While for Arg96 and Cys275, the FeMo-co protein environment in the \u03b11 subunit is positively correlated (6 out of 6 boxes are red in the first column of the pair, regardless of nucleotide type) in the \u03b12 subunit, several residues highlighted by blue color is different for MgATP-bound vs MgADP-bound form. These data strongly support the half-sites cooperativity mechanism by\ntetrafluoroaluminate-bound (PDB ID: 2AFI). Red and blue blocks indicate correlated and anti-correlated residue displacement, respectively. Each pair of columns uses a different amino acid as a fiducial. Note that all residues in the \u03b11 subunit are positively correlated, whereas correlation in \u03b12 depends on which position in \u03b11 is selected. The MgADP tetrafluoroaluminate-bound complex has more correlated motion between the selected residue in \u03b11 with all of \u03b12 (more red, less blue) than the ATP form. Therefore, ATP binding to Fe protein induces asymmetry in MoFe protein dynamics. b Time dependence of HDX rates for residues in the first coordination sphere based on peptide data. For visual clarity, the panels were simplified to show only key residues around the metal cluster. Amino acids are color-coded to indicate increased (purple) or decreased (green) rates of exchange during the indicated period after Fe protein binding to MoFe protein compared to exchange in MoFe protein alone. Residues in black were unaffected by Fe protein binding. Arg96His442-Arg359 have correlated pre-steady-state changes in dynamics (solid black double arrow). His195-Cys275 have anti-correlated pre-steady-state changes in dynamics (dotted black double arrow). In steady-state, Arg96 motion is always anti-correlated with the motion of His195 and Arg359 and less dynamic in the presence of the Fe protein (dashed black double arrow).\nCOMMUNICATIONS CHEMISTRY | (2023) 6:254 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42004-023-01046-6 | www.nature.com/commschem 5\ndifferentiating the two active sites. NMA shows unique connectivity across the MoFe protein-Fe protein complex, suggesting that the active site FeMo-co environment is tuned by dynamics directly related to Fe protein binding and nucleotide type.\nIf the active site dynamics are tuned and can be modulated by Fe protein, we reasoned that biophysical evidence may be present in the HDX-MS data. Therefore, we reanalyzed our HDX data, focusing on peptides in the first coordination sphere of FeMo-co, comparing the exchange rate with and without Fe protein. Labeling residues by the direction of change (increasing or decreasing) revealed that each time point has a distinct pattern of exchange (Fig. 4b). The changes in the exchange rate across time can be either parallel (correlated) or anti-parallel (anti-correlated). For example, in pre-steady-state Arg96, Arg359, and His442 act in concordance (solid black double arrow), while His195 and Cys275 are in opposition (dotted black double arrow) for the duration of the single turnover. In addition, the timing of the change in the exchange rate seems specific for each pair/triad. Similarly, in steady-state, the exchange rate of Arg96 is always anti-correlated with His195 and Arg359 and much slower in the presence of Fe protein (dashed black double arrow). These data provide direct biophysical evidence that Fe protein binding alters the protein stability and dynamics around the FeMo-co site on a catalytically relevant timescale and at system equilibrium. Because in vacuo FeMo-co is a trigonal prism (electronically symmetrical) while in the enzyme, the cluster is electronically asymmetric9,39, the temporally explicit exchange patterns of the first coordination sphere residues suggest protein dynamics as a means for tuning the properties of the FeMo-co.\nConcluding remarks. The biophysical and computational investigation of Fe protein-mediated electron delivery to MoFe protein has revealed long-range connectivity between Fe protein and the FeMo-co environment in the pre-steady-state and at equilibrium conditions. Our HDX measurements show that Fe protein docking initiates a wave of controlled increases and decreases in dynamics that traverses the complex from the [4Fe4S] cluster on Fe protein through the MoFe protein P-cluster and then FeMo-co (Fig. 5). This demonstrates the long-range coupling of protein motion in the MoFe protein-Fe protein complex on a time scale relevant to catalysis. In addition, NMA displayed asymmetry in the protein environment around FeMo-co that is distinct in the two halves of MoFe protein, providing the basis for negative cooperativity. NMA also revealed that MoFe protein motion was almost exclusively anti-correlated with respect to the motion of the two Fe proteins. In addition, Fe protein binding induces long-range structural changes largely dependent on the nucleotide type. All nucleotide type-dependent changes showed asymmetry in protein motion in MoFe protein. Overall, the role of protein dynamics and tuning of the conformational landscape during catalysis is consistent with classic models of negative cooperativity. However, unlike other allosterically regulated systems, Mo-nitrogenase must undergo multiple cycles to reduce nitrogen. Using a combination of in-solution and in-silico tools, nucleotide-dependent tuning of the active site cofactor via protein dynamics has emerged as the likely mechanism for the coordinated reduction of dinitrogen by Mo-nitrogenase."

Measured values were used to generate uptake curves to compare deuterium incorporation in all conditions. 37 peptides from the alpha subunit and 26 from the beta subunit showed a high confidence deuterium incorporation score (>0.70).

Calculations were performed on the crystal structure of the nitrogenase complex between Fe protein and MoFe protein from A. vinelandii with both two ATP analogs (\u03b2,\u03b3-methylene MgATP) (PDB ID: 4WZB29), and two MgADP (PDB ID: 2AFI29,) bound to each Fe protein. The presence of the various cofactors (iron/sulfur clusters, nucleosides, and homocitrate) was considered by adding beads as follows. (i) For the Fe protein cubane and the P-cluster, a bead was placed at the geometric center of each cluster. (ii) For the FeMo-co, two beads were added: one at the center of the Fe1, Fe2, Fe3, and Fe4 tetrahedron and the other at the center of the Fe5, Fe6, Fe7, and Mo tetrahedron. (iii) The homocitrate was described by a bead at its geometric center. (iv) ATP and ADP were modeled with three beads at the center of the adenine ring, the ribose ring, and the phosphate groups. As previously discussed, this representation of the nitrogenase complex accurately reproduces the relative magnitude of the experimental X-ray beta factors, giving confidence that the approach can describe the overall large amplitude motions of the nitrogenase complex12,32.\nReporting summary.
