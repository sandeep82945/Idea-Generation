1. **Investigate the role of proline in the development of fibrosis in endometriosis:** Explore the relationship between proline levels and the severity of fibrosis in endometriosis, and determine if proline can be used as a biomarker for fibrosis.


2. **Study the effects of oxidative stress on the metabolism of ketone bodies in endometriosis:** Examine the relationship between oxidative stress and the altered balance of ketone bodies in endometriosis, and investigate the potential role of ketone bodies as biomarkers for oxidative stress.


3. **Evaluate the impact of energy metabolism on immune function in endometriosis:** Investigate the effects of altered energy metabolism on the function of immune cells in endometriosis, and determine if these changes contribute to the development and progression of the disease.


4. **Explore the role of the kynurenine pathway in the immune dysregulation associated with endometriosis:** Investigate the relationship between the kynurenine pathway and immune dysfunction in endometriosis, and determine if metabolites of the kynurenine pathway can be used as biomarkers for immune dysregulation.


5. **Develop a multi-metabolite biomarker panel for the diagnosis of endometriosis:** Combine the identified metabolites (proline, Î²-hydroxybutyric acid, threonic acid, valine, and alanine) into a multi-metabolite biomarker panel and evaluate its diagnostic accuracy for endometriosis.
