    "abstractText": "The proteolytic active sites of the 26S proteasome are sequestered within the catalytic chamber of its 20S core particle (CP). Access to this chamber is through a narrow channel defined by the seven outer \u03b1 subunits. In the resting state, the N-termini of neighboring \u03b1 subunits form a gate blocking access to the channel. The attachment of the activators or regulatory particles rearranges the blocking \u03b1 subunit N-termini facilitating the entry of substrates. By truncating or mutating each of the participating \u03b1 N-termini, we report that whereas only a few N-termini are important for maintaining the closed gate, all seven N-termini participate in the open gate. Specifically, the open state is stabilized by a hydrogen bond between an invariant tyrosine (Y) in each subunit with a conserved aspartate (D) in its counterclockwise neighbor. The lone exception is the \u03b11\u2013\u03b12 pair leaving a gap in the ring circumference. The third residue (X) of this YD(X) motif aligns with the open channel. Phenylalanine at this position in the \u03b12 subunit comes in direct contact with the translocating substrate. Consequently, deletion of the \u03b12 N-terminal tail attenuates proteolysis despite the appearance of an open gate state. In summary, the interlacing N-terminal YD(X) motifs regulate both the gating and translocation of the substrate.",

            "text": "Careful removal of unwanted or unneeded proteins is necessary for cell survival. Eukaryotes have developed a complex yet controlled mechanism for precise proteolysis [1,2]. A multi-subunit protease, the proteasome, is the primary protease that carries out selective intracellular ATP-dependent protein degradation [3\u20135]. Regulation of this proteolytic pathway occurs at multiple levels, starting with the selection of substrates, recognition by the proteasome, and, once bound, the rate at which they are processed. In eukaryotes, proteasomes are typically found as a mixture of two main species: a 20S that consists only of a catalytic core and a 26S that is made up of the same 20S catalytic core attached to one or two regulatory particles (a.k.a. 19S or PA700) [6]. The 20S proteasome retains the basal ability found in archaeal proteasomes to proteolyze substrates with a significant disordered component [7]. By containing several ubiquitin-binding sites and six ATPase subunits (Rpts) in its regulatory particle, the eukaryotic 26S proteasome is selective for ubiquitinated proteins and can unfold globular domains; hence, its substrate repertoire differs from that of the 20S proteasome [1,3]. Indeed, in most cell lines under standard growth conditions, the majority of proteasomes are found as 26S holoenzymes [3,8,9].\nBiomolecules 2023, 13, 480. https://doi.org/10.3390/biom13030480 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/biomolecules\nThe 20S core particle is a cylinder-like structure composed of four stacked heptameric rings with C2 symmetry (\u03b17\u03b27\u03b27\u03b17) engendering a sequestered proteolytic chamber [6]. The two outer \u03b1 rings are each composed of seven structurally similar yet distinct subunits (\u03b11\u20137), and likewise, each of the two inner \u03b2 rings is formed from seven similar subunits (\u03b21\u20137). Only three of these \u03b2 subunits contain functional proteolytic active sites (\u03b21,2,5), while the outer \u03b1 rings define a gated channel leading into the inner proteolytic chamber (Supplementary Figure S1). Substrates traverse this channel on their way to being hydrolyzed by the proteolytic \u03b2 active sites [6]. In the 26S resting state, the gate through the 20S CP \u03b1 ring is closed, and the ATPase channel of the 19S RP is misaligned. Once a ubiquitin-conjugate is bound, ATPase conformational changes lead to gate opening and a contiguous channel through the ATPase ring to the catalytic core [10\u201313]. In this manner, regulatory complexes such as the 19S RP participate in channel gating through the 26S holoenzyme and facilitate substrate entry [14\u201320]. A gated channel at the entrance to the 20S is a feature of eukaryotic proteasomes [21\u201323]. In the simple homomeric archaeal 20S proteasome, the identical N-termini of \u03b1-ring subunits orient in a radial symmetry and thus do not necessarily regulate the 20S gate [18,20,24\u201330]. In contrast, in the closed-state eukaryotic proteasome, the N-termini of the seven different \u03b1-subunits extend into the center of the \u03b1-ring as each assumes a unique conformation that is accurately matched to form a plug. The longest N-terminal tail of \u03b13 runs across the diameter in the closed state, while the N-termini of other subunits curve upwards or downwards at the epicenter (Supplementary Figure S1). Support for the pivotal role of \u03b13 in gating was provided upon truncation of its N-terminal tail [23]. An atomic-level structure of these mutant proteasomes identified a pore at the center of the \u03b1 ring, and biochemical studies showed that these \u201copen gate\u201d proteasomes hydrolyze both peptides and proteins faster than WT [23,31\u201334]. During the transition from the closed to the open gate configuration, all N termini rearrange, pull away from the center, and interact through an invariant proline with a conserved tyrosine in the first \u03b1 helix (H0) of their neighbor [11]. A low occurrence of spontaneous rearrangement has been observed in free 20S CP, and the gate opening could be allosterically induced by signals from the active centers [29,35\u201338]. However, in the 26S proteasome, the open gate is induced and stabilized by the insertion of HbYX motifs at the C-termini of ATPase subunits into corresponding lysine-pockets on the outer \u03b1-surface of the 20S CP [18,20,39\u201343]. The open gate does not necessarily imply that the \u03b1 subunit N-termini are merely disordered or randomly rearranged. X-ray crystallography of a yeast 20S in complex with an activator (PA26 from T. brucei) identified a rearrangement in a cluster of four highly conserved residues (YD-P-Y) near the N-terminus of each \u03b1 subunit that stabilizes the open conformation [30]. Support for a role of the N-termini in defining a stable open conformation came from single-site substitutions of Tyr8 or Asp9 situated in the flexible N-terminal tail of the archaeal \u03b1 subunit that resulted in slower proteolysis even in the presence of proteasome activators [30], or from substitutions in a cluster of aromatic residues of \u03b12 and \u03b13 subunits in yeast that resulted in resistance to stress conditions that increase the need for unfolded protein response [11]. In order to provide further details of the contribution of different \u03b1-subunit N-termini to the stabilization of either closed or open states, we compared the effects of mutating a conserved tyrosine residue in the N-terminal tail of each of the seven \u03b1 subunits and found that they invariantly contribute to the open state. An open gate conformation is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the tyrosine side chain of each \u03b1 subunit and aspartate in the following \u03b1 subunit. Though not conserved, the third residue in the sequence (YD(X)) of each subunit points directly toward the epicenter and lines the gate. Specifically, phenylalanine of \u03b12 at this position engages the translocating substrate, as we reestablished from the published structures. We conclude that the N-terminal tail of \u03b12 plays a unique role in facilitating substrates processing of 26S proteasome."

The mutated DNA fragments were cloned into the pUC19 plasmids, and the resulting clone was sequenced.

In short, a purified proteasome sample was diluted with 5 mM Tris/HCl buffer pH 7.0 to obtain nanomolar concentrations of the protein. About 3 \u00b5L of the sample was deposited on a freshly cleaved muscovite mica surface. After about 5 min, the proteasomes, which attached electrostatically to the mica, were overlaid with 30 \u00b5L of the buffer used for dilution and mounted in the \u201cwet chamber\u201d of the NanoScope IIIa (Bruker Inc., Santa Barbara, CA, USA). Imaging was performed in a tapping mode in liquid using oxide-sharpened silicon nitride tips on cantilevers with a nominal spring constant of 0.32 N/m (Bruker Inc.). The resonant frequency of the tip was tuned to 9\u201310 kHz, with an amplitude of 200\u2013500 mV and a setpoint ranging from 1.4 V to 1.8 V. Fields of 1 \u00b5m2 were scanned at the rates of 2\u20133 Hz, with trace and retrace images collected. The apparent resolution of images collected in the height mode was 512 \u00d7 512 pixels, which translated into single-pixel dimensions of about 2 nm2. The height-mode imaging data remain \u201craw\u201d since the whole fields were subjected only to plane-fit and 1st-order flattening with the NanoScope IIIa (v. 5.12r3) or NanoScope Analysis (v. 1.7) Software (Bruker Corp., Billerica, MA, USA). For display purposes, images of single particles were zoomed in from the fields, their brightness and contrast were adjusted, and the occasional scan lines were removed\nwith the NanoScope IIIa or NanoScope Analysis. The \u201copen,\u201d \u201cintermediate,\u201d and \u201cclosed\u201d gate conformations for the single 20S proteasome particles in the top-view position were distinguished as previously described [47\u201349]. Briefly, the 6-pixel scan across the center of the \u03b1-ring was considered a representation of the proteasome \u201c\u03b1-face\u201d with the central gate. Numerical values for the heights of these pixels (\u201cscan lines\u201d) were collected with a practical vertical resolution of about 1 \u00c5. When a plot of the scan line revealed a local maximum, the gate (and the respective particle) was classified as \u201cclosed.\u201d Accordingly, the presence of a local minimum (a central dip) indicated the \u201copen gate.\u201d In turn, if a scan line presented a concave function without a local minimum, the gate was assigned an \u201cintermediate\u201d status [47\u201349].

Proteasomes were isolated from the yeast lysate by a set of differential centrifugations followed by ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography [36]. All procedures were carried out at 4 \u25e6C or on ice unless specified. Proteasome activity in each purification step and in chromatographic fractions was tested with SucLLVY-AMC, as described [36]. In short, the crude lysate after cell breaking was clarified by 20 min centrifugation at 10,000\u00d7 g and then centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000\u00d7 g. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged for 7 h at 100,000\u00d7 g to pellet high molecular weight proteins. The resulting pellet was re-solubilized by homogenization (Dounce homogenizer) in column buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 20% glycerol). The resulting high molecular weight protein fraction was treated with a mixture of 1 mg/mL RNase A and RNase mix (1% vol/vol each) for 1 h at 37 \u25e6C, followed by 10 min centrifugation at 15,000\u00d7 g. The pellet containing contaminating RNA fragments was discarded. The supernatant was filtered using a 200 \u00b5m syringe or a spin filter and subjected to anion exchange chromatography (Q Sepharose; Sigma-Aldrich, Burlington, MA, USA) with a gradient of 0\u20130.5 M NaCl in column buffer used to elute the proteasome. The proteasome-containing fractions were pooled, and the buffer was exchanged for 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 20% glycerol, using spin filters with 100 kDa molecular weight cut-off. The sample was then subjected to column chromatography on hydroxyapatite using a phosphate gradient. The resulting proteasome-containing fractions were gel filtrated on Superose 6.

Once thawed, aliquots were stored on ice and used within 48 h. The peptidase activity of the 20S proteasome was measured with commonly used fluorogenic peptide substrates (Bachem, Calbiochem): succinyl-LeuLeuValTyr-4-methylcoumarin7-amide (SucLLVY-MCA, for measuring ChT-L activity), butoxycarbonyl-LeuArgArg-MCA (BocLRR-MCA, for T-L activity), and carbobenzoxy-LeuLeuGlu-\u03b2-naphthylamide (Z-LLE\u03b2NA, for PGPH activity). The substrates were routinely used at the final concentration of 100 \u00b5M, except for Km and Vmax determination, when a range of at least 6 concentrations from 20 \u00b5M to 150 \u00b5M was used [50]. Stock solutions of the peptide substrates were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Enzyme activities were determined fluorometrically based on reaction rates calculated from reactions run for 60 min at 25 \u25e6C [36]."

            "text": "In the closed gate conformation, all seven N-termini of 20S CP \u03b1-subunits project in an extended secondary structure toward the center of the ring, forming a mesh of interactions (Supplementary Figure S1). All seven N-terminal sequences are notable for a YD(X) motif, conserved between eukaryotes and found even in the archaeal sequence (Figures 1A and S2A,B). To test the contribution of this conserved element to the stabilization of the closed conformation, we replaced the invariant tyrosine with alanine in all subunits. The whole-cell extract from the mutant yeast strains was resolved by nondenaturing PAGE to visualize proteasome peptidase activity (Figure 1B). Proteasome composition and activity in the resulting whole-cell extract were similar across mutants and WT. No discernable activity of free 20S proteasomes was detected. To compare the activities of WT and mutant 20S particles, free-20S CP was generated by disassembling 26S proteasomes upon exposure to high ionic concertation with 500 mM KCl [51\u201353]. The released free 20S CP from \u03b14Y/A mutant showed higher basal peptidase activities relative to WT or all other Y to A mutants, even without further stimulation by SDS (Figure 1B). Although all \u03b1-subunits harbor a tyrosine at an equivalent position in their N-termini, only a mutation of tyrosine in the \u03b14 subunit led to an increase in basal 20S peptidase activity (Figure 1B). A metadata analysis of the 20S structure (pdb: 1 ryp) for the molecular interactions of these N-terminal residues reveals that the tyrosine of the \u03b14 YD(X) motif forms a hydrogen bond with the aspartate of \u03b13 YD(X) (Figure 1C). Mutating the equivalent aspartate of the \u03b13 N-terminal tail shows similar stimulation of 20S peptidase activity (Figure 1B), supporting the importance of the H-bond between the YD(X) motifs of these two neighboring subunits. The only other YD(X) motif pair that is implicated in a similar Hbonding is between Tyr of \u03b16 and Asp of \u03b17 (Figure 1D); however, mutating the \u03b16 tyrosine of its YD(X) motif did not affect the free 20S peptidase activity. In addition, the N-terminus of \u03b14 is notable for projecting downwards into the 20S substrate translocation channel, positioning below the gate (Figure 1C). The only other N-terminus that is similarly positioned is that of \u03b12, observed in both yeast and human 20S CP (Supplementary Figures S1 and S2A).\nUnlike \u03b14, available model structures do not implicate \u03b12 in H-bonding with neighboring YD(X) in the closed state of the 20S CP.

Based on peptidase activity, no detectable changes to 30S/26S proteasome activity were observed; however, there was a noticeable increase in basal peptidase activities of 20S in extracts from \u03b12\u2206N, \u03b13\u2206N, or the double mutant \u03b13/\u03b17\u2206N compared to WT (Figure 2B).

Typica ly, 20S CP can be found in a mixture of closed, open, and intermediate conformers [47\u201349,54]. These three categories are identified in a representative AFM field of purified 20S particles from yeast (Figure 3A). To correlate between the peptidase activity measured for 20S particles in Figures 1 and 2 and \u03b1-ring gate dynamics, we performed AFM imaging on isolated 20S particles from WT and \u03b12\u2206N, \u03b16\u2206N, \u03b13\u2206N, \u03b17\u2206N, and the double mutant \u03b13/\u03b17\u2206N. For each mutant, we analyzed between 360 and 810 single particles imaged from 6 to 13 scanned fields. Conformer partitioning of 20S particles from WT yeast was 75% (\u00b14%) closed, 17% (\u00b14%) intermediate, and 8% (\u00b13%) open (Figure 3B,C), in concordance with the distribution of human 20S proteasomes [47\u201349,54]. No closed-gate particles were detected for the \u03b13\u2206N mutant; the overwhelming majority were open, albeit a well-detectable subpopulation (13% \u00b1 4%) displayed an intermediate conformer. The 20S proteasomes from the \u03b17\u2206N mutant were also heavily affected, with mostly open particles (66% \u00b1 4%), a sizable intermediate population (26% \u00b1 5%), and a low number of closed-gate forms\n(7% \u00b1 2%). Likewise, no properly formed closed forms were identified for \u03b13/\u03b17\u2206N 20S proteasomes; however, the majority were classified as a new form that we refer to as pseudoopen (Figure 3B,C). These double mutant particles appeared flatter than WT closed particles. The observation was confirmed by roughness analysis (a measure of flatness) of the images of the gate area, where the pseudo-open double mutant particles were significantly distinct from the closed control (Supplementary Figure S4). For comparison, the flatness of closed \u03b16\u2206N particles was neither significantly different from the control nor from the double mutant. Partitioning of conformers from \u03b12\u2206N and \u03b14Y/A mutants were similar, with more than double the number of complexes with open gate (17\u201318%) compared to wild type, a relatively large subpopulation of intermediate forms (25\u201327%) and 56\u201357% of the particles were distinctly closed (Figure 3B,C). Deletion of the \u03b16 N-terminal tail also led to the mild elevation of intermediate (23% \u00b1 3%) and open (10% \u00b1 3%) particles at the expense of closed (66% \u00b1 4%) forms in \u03b16\u2206N mutant as compared to the wild type.

Such images were also prevalent among the \u03b17\u2206N mutant proteasomes.

The populations of intermediate and open-gate forms became more numerous in \u03b12\u2206N and \u03b14Y/A mutants.

Mean + SD values are presented and computed for n fields with a total of x particles. From left (WT) to right (\u03b16\u2206N), the n-x values are 11\u2013688, 8\u2013446, 6\u2013361, 13\u2013625, 12\u2013810, 8\u2013546, and 8\u2013443.\n3D rendering of a typical plot of the gate area in closed conformation is markedly convex (Figure 3A). This is likely a result of the top-positioned N-terminal tails, most notably those from \u03b11, \u03b16, and \u03b17, interacting with the AFM probe and repelling it just above the closed gate. Since in the closed position, the N-terminal fragment of \u03b13 subunit traverses most of the \u03b1-ring surface and crosses the center of the gate, deletion results in severe destabilization of the closed gate. The resulting open and intermediate particles display elevated peptidase activity (Figure 2). The N-terminus of \u03b17 points upwards from the \u03b1-ring surface, explaining the apparent open state assigned by the AFM probe of \u03b17\u2206N 20S proteasomes (Figure 3B). When both \u03b13 and \u03b17 tails are deleted in the double mutant, the top layer of the gate is destabilized strongly enough for the AFM probe to start detecting the second layer of the gate closure, consisting of downward-pointing tails of \u03b12 and \u03b14. Indeed, the flatness of gate area images was a tell-tale of non-standard interactions between the AFM probe and the gate parts, defined as the pseudo-open conformation. Interestingly, deleting tails of other subunits\u2014\u03b12\u2206N, \u03b16\u2206N, and even the single substitution of the conserved YD(X) tyrosine of \u03b14 in \u03b14Y/A\u2014led to a greater portion of open and intermediate 20S conformers relative to wild type. The enhanced peptidase activity measure for the \u03b16 and \u03b14 mutants may be correlated with the role of their N-termini in securing neighboring subunits in the closed state (Figure 1). Deletion of the \u03b12 N-terminal tail also led to enhanced peptidase activity and seemingly greater gate dynamics, although it is not documented to form H-bonds with other tails. Therefore, we focused on the contribution of this tail to proteolysis."

            "text": "In the closed state, since the N-terminal tail of \u03b12 is buried below the top layer of the gate, without contacting other N-termini (Figure 1C), we wished to understand whether the elevated peptidase activity displayed for the \u03b12\u2206N 20S CP (Figure 2) holds for larger substrates. To do so, we compared intracellular proteolysis rates in \u03b12\u2206N and WT strains by pulse-chase experiment using two different short-lived substrates (Figure 4A). Degradation of GCN4-\u03b2gal and Ub-Pro-\u03b2gal was slower in the \u03b12\u2206N mutant compared to WT (Figure 4B,C). Likewise, in \u03b16\u2206N, the degradation rates were slightly decreased compared to WT. In contrast, the \u03b13/\u03b17\u2206N mutant degrades these two substrates faster than WT (Figure 4B) and [9,33,55,56], in accordance with its enhanced peptidase activity in Figure 2, supporting the critical role of \u03b13 and \u03b17 N-terminal tails in maintaining the closed gate conformation. PolyUb-conjugates accumulated in the \u03b12\u2206N mutant (Figure 4D),\nsuggesting that the 26S proteasome is rate-limiting for the conjugate removal in this mutant strain. Inefficient proteolysis was further demonstrated by the sensitivity of \u03b12\u2206N and \u03b16\u2206N strains to the amino acid analog Canavanine (Figure 4E). The combined phenotypes of the \u03b12\u2206N mutant suggest that the N-terminal tail of \u03b12 potentially regulates proteasome degradation function distinctly from other tails that participated in the closed gate state.

All seven residues are on the same plane, pointing inwards in an equivalent manner lining the central pore. Of note, four of the residues are positively charged or hydrophilic (five in human proteasomes), whereas two highly conserved residues are large hydrophobic amino acids (Phenylalanine in \u03b12; Leucine in \u03b17). To summarize, the open gate state is not merely a disruption of the N terminal tails positions in the closed state but a distinct arrangement of its own. In the open state, the N-termini are not \u201cflexible\u201d but rather locked into a given conformation (the N-ring) that may reflect their role in substrate translocation."

            "text": "Thorough insight to substrate processing by the 26S proteasome was advanced by two recent studies that imaged a trapped substrate polypeptide in the translocation channel [12,13]. In the substrate processing state, the substrate backbone was traced from the ATPase pore to the 20S \u03b1-ring. The 20S gate is in an open state with all seven N-termini locked into the N-ring, forming a contagious channel with the ATPases (Figure 6A). Upon further analysis, interestingly, we observed in both human and yeast 26S structures, the substrate was found close to the \u03b12 N-terminal tail. Specifically, in yeast proteasome, the substrate interacts with Phe7 of \u03b12 (Figure 6B), and likewise, the translocating substrate contacts Phe8 of human \u03b12 (Figure 6C). Both interactions are in the form of van der Waals interactions between hydrophobic groups (Supplementary Figure S5). The nature of this interaction is made possible due to the invariant Phenylalanine at position \u201cX\u201d that lines the channel among all the YD(X) motifs (Supplementary Figure S2). This interpretation supports our observation that the deletion of \u03b12 N-terminal tail attenuated substrate degradation by 26S proteasomes (Figure 4), consistent with a role for \u03b12 N-terminal tail in substrate translocation.

Discussion This study identifies a motif in the N-termini of 20S \u03b1 subunits that plays a dual role in both gating the translocation channel and facilitating substrate translocation. A prominent feature of eukaryotic 20S proteasomes is divergent and flexible N-termini that nevertheless share a conserved motif, referred to in this study as the YD(X) motif. These Nterminal tails inter-lace over more than one plane, hindering substrate entry in the 20S closed state yet pulling away from the center, defining an adequate pore for substrate entry in the open state. Rather than being merely disordered in the open state, this study provides evidence for a structured open state and participation of the N-terminal tails in regulating both the closed and open conformations of 20S CP. The concept of neighboring Y-D residues interacting in both closed and open states has been raised before [11,30]; here, we add that in the transition between closed and open states, some H-bond break, enabling the same residues to partner up with different neighbors. Specifically, interactions between three neighboring Y-D residues lock the gate in the closed state of the 20S translocation channel. Interactions between six Y-D pairs similarly stabilize the open gate conformation. The third residue of this motif-X, which lines the translocation channel, has a role in the 20S open state to interact with the translocating substrate.\nDisordering of the N-terminal tails alone is insufficient to allow unobstructed entry through the pore, and the blocking residues may need to be removed or anchored into a stable, open conformation to relieve obstruction of the channel. An implication is that the open gate, as defined by structural methods such as AFM, does not necessarily correlate with biochemical properties such as proteolytic activity. This property is exemplified by deleting the N-terminal tail of \u03b12, which appears partially \u201copen\u201d by AFM and is indeed enhanced for peptidase activity, yet in sharp contrast to \u03b13\u0394N proteasomes, displays\n6.

This suggests that conditions enhancing peptidase activity do not necessarily correlate with proteolytic efficiency due to the need for engagement of critical \u03b1-ring N-terminal tail residues during translocation of a long polypeptide. Interestingly, in the closed state, \u03b13 N-terminus does seem to serve as the linchpin. To a large extent, this could be attributed to its tight interaction with the N-terminal tail of \u03b14. Rearrangement necessitates the breaking of some key interactions that anchor the tails in the closed conformation while forming competing new interactions to stabilize them in an open state. The most dramatic movement is of \u03b12 and \u03b14 N-termini that flip from being buried below the surface (Figure 1) to being above the surface as part of the \u03b1 N-ring (Figure 5). In both cases, their YD residues establish new H-bonds. In the case of \u03b14, this transition is also accompanied by breaking H-bonds with neighbors formed in the closed state. This could explain how single-site substitutions in \u03b13 or \u03b14 tails are sufficient to destabilize the closed state. The important conclusion is that the open state of 20S CP is well-defined through the interlocking of the \u03b1-subunit N termini, as can be easily visualized in the published structures, PDB:6ef3 or PDB:6msk (Figures 5 and 6). Interestingly, our metadata analysis highlights that in the \u03b1 N-ring, all nearest neighbors are locked except for \u03b11\u2013\u03b12, which leaves room for flexibility and lateral movement in the ring. This may accommodate side chains or residual secondary structure of the substrate polypeptide or may be linked to their positioning in the translocation channel above the \u03b22 active site in the proteolytic chamber, next layer. Additionally, in the open gate state, \u03b12 interacts with the translocating substrate. The identity of X in the YD(X) motif defines the nature of interaction with substrates at the pore: for now, we know only of hydrophobic interactions between substrate and the invariant phenylalanine of \u03b12. However, the roles of other X residues in the rest of the \u03b1 subunits may become apparent with other substrates or other steps of the translocation."

The 20S \u03b1 subunits stabilize both closed and open states by reorganizing specific interactions between neigh-\nboring residues in their N-terminal tails. A characteristic YD(X) motif in these tails is a hotspot for interaction switches between closed and open conformations. The N-tail of the \u03b12 subunit predominantly participates in substrate proteolysis, most likely by directly interacting with the substrate. Through such interactions with substrate, the \u03b1 subunit N ring defines not only substrate selectivity but possibly even cleavage specificity and the nature of products generated. By mutating the X residue of the YD(X) motif in alpha2 and in the other critical alpha subunits, one could map their relative responsibilities in substrate translocation and subsequent proteolysis.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/biom13030480/s1: Figure S1: The \u03b1-ring of closed 20S gate; Figure S2: YD(X) motifs of \u03b1-subunit N-termini of human proteasome; Figure S3: YD(X) motif Interactions in closed state human 20S proteasome; Figure S4: Roughness analysis of the 20S gate area; Figure S5: Substrate interaction with Phe residue in N-terminal tail of the \u03b12 subunit.\nAuthor Contributions: M.B. and M.H.G. conceived the project.
