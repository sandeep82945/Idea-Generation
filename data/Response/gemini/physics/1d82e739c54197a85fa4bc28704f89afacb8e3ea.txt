1. **Investigate the potential of UA to modulate other NRs:** The paper primarily focuses on the interaction between UA and PPARs, LXRs, PXR/CAR, ROR, and FXR. However, there are other NRs that play crucial roles in various physiological processes. Future research could explore the effects of UA on these NRs, such as the estrogen receptor (ER), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), to gain a more comprehensive understanding of its NR-mediated bioactivities.


2. **Evaluate the synergistic effects of UA with other NR modulators:** The paper highlights the therapeutic potential of UA as a single agent. However, it is possible that combining UA with other NR modulators could lead to synergistic or additive effects. Future studies could investigate the potential benefits of combining UA with other NRs agonists or antagonists to enhance its efficacy and broaden its therapeutic applications.


3. **Explore the molecular mechanisms underlying UA's NR modulation:** The paper provides evidence of UA's interaction with various NRs, but the exact molecular mechanisms responsible for this modulation are not fully understood. Future research could employ techniques such as molecular docking, mutagenesis, and gene expression profiling to elucidate the specific binding sites, conformational changes, and downstream signaling pathways involved in UA's NR modulation.


4. **Investigate the tissue-specific effects of UA on NR modulation:** The paper mentions that UA's effects on NRs can vary depending on the cellular context and tissue type. Future studies could delve deeper into the tissue-specific differences in UA's NR modulation. This could involve comparing the effects of UA on NRs in different cell lines, tissues, and organs to identify potential variations in its NR-mediated bioactivities.


5. **Assess the long-term safety and efficacy of UA in NR-related diseases:** The paper primarily focuses on the short-term effects of UA on NR modulation and its associated bioactivities. However, the long-term safety and efficacy of UA in the context of NR-related diseases need to be thoroughly evaluated. Future studies could conduct long-term animal studies and clinical trials to assess the potential risks and benefits of UA in the management of chronic diseases such as metabolic disorders, autoimmune diseases, and cancer.
