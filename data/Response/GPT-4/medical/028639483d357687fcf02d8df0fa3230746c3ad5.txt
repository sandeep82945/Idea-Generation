Genetic Mapping of RSA Traits in Peach Rootstocks: Develop a genetic mapping study to identify specific genes or genomic regions associated with beneficial RSA traits. This research could use advanced genomics and bioinformatics tools to link phenotypic traits observed in the rhizobox studies to genetic markers. This would facilitate marker-assisted selection in breeding programs aimed at developing rootstocks with optimized RSA for different environmental conditions and soil types.

Long-term Field Performance of Identified Rootstocks: Conduct longitudinal field trials to assess the performance of the peach rootstocks (especially BC1251 and BC1256 due to their promising traits) in real-world conditions across different soil types in Florida and other regions with similar soil diversity. This would validate the predictive value of rhizobox studies for field performance and allow for the assessment of impacts on tree health, yield, and resilience to environmental stresses.

Rootstock Interaction with Soil Microbiome: Investigate the interaction between the root systems of different peach rootstocks and the soil microbiome in various soil types. This research could explore how RSA influences the establishment and composition of beneficial soil microbial communities and how these relationships impact nutrient uptake, growth, and disease resistance in peach trees.

Root Architectural Plasticity and Environmental Stress Response: Explore the plasticity of RSA in response to different environmental stresses, such as drought, flooding, and nutrient deficiency, across the promising rootstock genotypes. This research could provide insights into how root system plasticity contributes to peach tree resilience under climate change scenarios and inform breeding programs focused on enhancing stress tolerance.

Comparative Analysis of Root Architectural Traits Across Prunus Species: Given the wide genetic diversity within the Prunus genus, a comparative study of RSA traits across a broader range of species and hybrids could reveal novel traits and mechanisms for soil resource acquisition. This research could expand the genetic base for breeding programs and potentially identify new rootstock candidates for peach and other Prunus fruit crops facing similar horticultural challenges.
