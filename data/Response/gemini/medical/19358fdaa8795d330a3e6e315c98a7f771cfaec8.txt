1. **Investigate the use of different deep learning architectures for surgical tool classification.** The paper uses a ConvNext model for surgical tool classification, but other architectures, such as ResNet or EfficientNet, may also be effective. It would be interesting to compare the performance of different architectures on this task.


2. **Explore the use of different data augmentation techniques for surgical tool classification.** The paper uses the squish method for data augmentation, but other techniques, such as random cropping, flipping, and rotation, may also be effective. It would be interesting to investigate the impact of different data augmentation techniques on the performance of surgical tool classification models.


3. **Develop a method for automatically generating segmentation masks for surgical tool classification.** The paper uses manually generated segmentation masks for training the dynamic cropping model. However, it would be more efficient to develop a method for automatically generating these masks. This could be done using a deep learning model or a computer vision algorithm.


4. **Investigate the use of explainability techniques to interpret the predictions of surgical tool classification models.** The paper uses GradCAM and IntegratedGrad to interpret the predictions of the surgical tool classification model. However, other explainability techniques, such as SHAP or LIME, may also be effective. It would be interesting to compare the performance of different explainability techniques on this task.


5. **Apply the proposed method to other surgical tasks.** The paper focuses on surgical tool classification, but the proposed method could also be applied to other surgical tasks, such as surgical gesture recognition or surgical skill assessment. It would be interesting to investigate the performance of the proposed method on these tasks.
