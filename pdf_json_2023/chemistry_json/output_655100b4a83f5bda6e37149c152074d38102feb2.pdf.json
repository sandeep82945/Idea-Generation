    "abstractText": "In this study, we present a facile surface modification method using green solvents for a commercial polyimide (PI) nanofiltration membrane to exhibit good acid stability. To enhance acid stability, the PI organic solvent nanofiltration membrane was modified using Fenton\u2019s reaction, an oxidative cross-linking process, using environmentally friendly solvents: water and ethanol. The surface properties of the pristine and modified PI membranes were investigated and compared using various analytical tools. We studied the surface morphology using scanning electron microscopy, performed elemental analysis using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, investigated chemical bonds using attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and studied thermal stability using thermogravimetric analysis. The acid resistances of the pristine and modified membranes were confirmed through performance tests. The pristine PI nanofiltration membrane exposed to a 50 w/v% sulfuric acid for 4 h showed an increase in the normalized water flux to 205% and a decrease in the MgSO4 normalized rejection to 44%, revealing damage to the membrane. The membrane modified by the Fenton reaction exhibited a decline in flux and improved rejection, which are typical performance changes after surface modification. However, the Fenton-modified membrane exposed to 50 w/v% sulfuric acid for 4 h showed a flux increase of 7% and a rejection increase of 4%, indicating improved acid resistance. Furthermore, the Fenton post-treatment enhanced the thermal stability and organic solvent resistance of the PI membrane. This study shows that the acid resistance of PI membranes can be successfully improved by a novel and facile Fenton reaction using green solvents.",

            "text": "Water is vital for living organisms and is a crucial resource for the sustainable development of the earth\u2019s environment. Today, approximately 88% of developing countries face water shortages and scarcity [1]. Therefore, state-of-the-art water and wastewater treatment technologies are required to overcome this problem. Membrane separation processes are widely used in water and wastewater treatment. Among the various pressure-driven membranes, nanofiltration (NF) membranes, which have a pore diameter of approximately 0.5\u20132.0 nm, have recently attracted significant attention [2]. This is mainly attributed to their lower required pressure, high permeate flux, cost-effectiveness, high retention of multivalent salts, and ability to separate low molecular weight organic compounds (i.e., those with molecular weight in the range 200\u20131000 g mol\u22121)) from solutions containing monovalent ions. Recently, there has been an increasing demand for acid-resistant NF membranes, particularly for the recovery of target chemical compounds from highly acidic aqueous\nPolymers 2023, 15, 264. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym15020264 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2023, 15, 264 2 of 15\nand organic solutions. NF membranes are used particularly widely in the pulp and paper industries for the treatment of acidic effluents [3], the mining and metal industries for the removal of heavy metals [4] and sulfate ions [5], dairy cleaning-in-place processes for the regeneration of acid streams [6], gold ore processing for the removal of gold from solutions with high sulfuric acid concentrations [4], and sewage sludge treatment for the recovery of phosphorous [7,8]. Other uses of acid-resistant NF membranes include the separation of rare-earth elements, such as lanthanum and yttrium, from strong acids, such as nitric acid (HNO3), hydrochloric acid (HCl), and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) [9]. NF membranes are also used in the semiconductor industry for the treatment of the etching wastewater containing HCl, hydrobromic acid (HBr), and hydroiodic acid (HI) [10,11]. In all the aforementioned applications, membranes must operate in low pH solutions. Although high-performance commercial NF full-aromatic polyamide membranes, which are fabricated from piperazine (PIP) or m-phenylenediamine (MPD) with trimesoyl chloride (TMC), are available, their application is limited to the pH range of 2\u201311 [11\u201313]. Among a wide range of polymer materials, polyimide (PI) is known for its good chemical, thermal, and mechanical stability, as well as exceptional engineering processability [14,15]. Modified PI show enhanced chemical stability, that is, excellent resistance to many polar aprotic organic solvents, because of the rigid structure of the polymer backbone [16,17]. Diamines are the most commonly used crosslinkers for modifying PI membranes. Diamines react with a carboxylic group in the form of poly(amic acid) to form a bridge between two polymer chains. Modification with diamines is performed by adding them to the polymer casting solution. Zhao et al. [18] added a cross-linking agent to a polymer solution with a concentration of less than 5 wt.% to avoid gel formation. The modified PI membrane was more flexible than the unmodified PI membrane and demonstrated higher gas permeability and selectivity. This method of adding a cross-linking agent to the casting solution can only be used with polymer solutions of very low concentration to avoid gelation of the casting solution before film synthesis. Hence, its use is limited to the production of thin and dense PI films suitable for gas separation. At the same time, there are cases in which cross-linking is performed via post-treatment of the fabricated membrane. Toh et al. [19] modified Lenzing P84 PI membranes with aliphatic diamines (ethylenediamine (EDA), propylenediamine, 1,6-hexanediamine, and 1,8-octanediamine). The modified membranes showed excellent resistance to N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), and N,N\u2019-dimethylformamide (DMF); furthermore, using the filtration test with toluene, they elucidated that cross-linking reduces the flux by making the active layer denser. The membrane modified using EDA showed a high flux in DMF; moreover, its stable performance was confirmed even after 120 h. Vanherck et al. [20] modified Matrimid PI membranes with aromatic diamine p-xylenediamine to prepare stable membranes for the filtration of DMA, DMSO, NMP, tetrahydrofuran, and DMF. With increasing cross-linking time, the flux decreased, indicating that the active layer became denser. The membrane showed excellent performance in DMF, a flux of up to 5 LMH, and the rejection of methyl orange of up to 98%. In the development of membranes for the treatment of solutions containing both organic solvents and acids, it may be a promising strategy to impart acid resistance to organic-solvent-resistant PI membranes via post-treatment. Recently, sustainability and green chemistry have attracted considerable interest for reducing the worldwide usage of toxic chemicals and pollution. However, in most membrane fabrication and modification processes, conventional toxic solvents are used [21,22]; therefore, studies have been currently focused on replacing these solvents with non-toxic or green alternatives. Figure 1 presents the major merits of using green solvents as replacements for toxic solvents. The expression \u201cgreen chemistry\u201d was introduced to attract the attention of scientists worldwide to limit the utilization of hazardous and toxic reagents or solvents in the production of chemicals [23].\nPolymers 2023, 15, 264 3 of 15\nPolymers\u00a02023,\u00a015,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 3\u00a0 of\u00a0 16\u00a0

polybenzimidazole (PBI) backbone using pota sium persulfate as an oxidant; this method is categorized as \u201cgreen\u201d because of the use of an aqueous solution instead of toxic solvents [24]. In another study, Shin et al. modified a PBI organicsolvent-resistant NF membrane using oxidative cross-linking with an aqueous solution of potassium permanganate (KMnO4) [25]. Membrane science and technology is one of the crucial components f green chemistry because it plays a major role in the en iron ental friendliness of industrial processes. Al hough r cent dva cem nts in the field of membrane fabrication and performance enhancement are commendable, the materials used must be revised to reduce the pollution and pernicious effects of toxic chemicals [26\u201328]. Herein, a novel facile method for cross-linking the commercially available PI NF membranes via post-treatment is introduced to improve their acid stability. The Fenton reaction, an oxidative cr ss-linking process involving catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to hydroxyl radicals in presence of ferrous iron, wa applied to cr sslink and improve the acid resistance of the embrane. In this meth d, green solve ts (water and ethanol) are used, making it a sustainable approach to cross-linking/modification of PI membranes. The surface properties of the pristine and modified PI membranes were studied using various characterization methods; the acid stability of the membranes was investigated using 50 w/v% H2SO4, and the water flux and MgSO4 rejection were determined through a filtration test. Changes in the surface properties of the PI membranes after exposure to acid were evaluated using various analytical tools."

Unless indicated otherwise, acid-resistance tests were performed under these conditions. However, for the long-term exposure test, the membrane was exposed to 15 w/v% H2SO4 for 240 h.

Molecular Weight Cut-Off (MWCO) and Pore Size of Membranes\nMWCO of the membranes was determined by the molecular weight of the neutral solute, in which 90% of the solute was retained by the membrane. The MWCO values of the pristine and Fenton-modified membranes were obtained using the previously reported method [30\u201332].

The pH values of the H2SO4 solutions with pKa of \u22123 and 1.9 [34] are approximately \u22120.2. The flux and rejection of the PI membrane after exposure to 15 w/v% H2SO4 (Figure 2a and 2b, respectively) can be categorized into three phases. In phase I, the flux slightly increases, and the rejection remains almost constant. In phase II, the flux gradually increases, but rejection monotonically decreases. In phase III, the flux rapidly increases, and the membrane loses its capability to reject ions from the feed solution. From these results, it can be inferred that the PI membrane has a certain tolerance for acid, but beyond this range, the membrane degrades under acidic conditions.\nPolymers 2023, 15, 264 6 of 15\nPolymers\u00a02023,\u00a015,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 6\u00a0 of\u00a0 16\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\n3.\u00a0Result\u00a0and\u00a0Discussion\u00a0 \u00a0 3.1.\u00a0Performance\u00a0Degradation\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0PI\u00a0Membrane\u00a0owing\u00a0to\u00a0Acid\u00a0Exposure\u00a0\nThe\u00a0acid\u00a0resistance\u00a0of\u00a0PI\u00a0membranes\u00a0was\u00a0evaluated\u00a0by\u00a0exposure\u00a0to\u00a015\u00a0w/v%\u00a0H2SO4\u00a0 for\u00a0240\u00a0h.\u00a0The\u00a0pH\u00a0values\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0H2SO4\u00a0solutions\u00a0with\u00a0pKa\u00a0of\u00a0\u22123\u00a0and\u00a01.9\u00a0[34]\u00a0are\u00a0approxi\u2010 mately\u00a0\u22120.2.\u00a0The\u00a0flux\u00a0and\u00a0rejection\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0PI\u00a0membrane\u00a0after\u00a0exposure\u00a0to\u00a015\u00a0w/v%\u00a0H2SO4\u00a0 (Figure\u00a02a,b,\u00a0respectively)\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0categorized\u00a0into\u00a0three\u00a0phases.\u00a0In\u00a0phase\u00a0I,\u00a0the\u00a0flux\u00a0slightly\u00a0 increases,\u00a0and\u00a0 the\u00a0rejection\u00a0remains\u00a0almost\u00a0constant.\u00a0In\u00a0phase\u00a0 II,\u00a0 the\u00a0 flux\u00a0gradually\u00a0 in\u2010 creases,\u00a0but\u00a0rejection\u00a0monotonically\u00a0decreases.\u00a0In\u00a0phase\u00a0III,\u00a0the\u00a0flux\u00a0rapidly\u00a0increases,\u00a0and\u00a0 the\u00a0membrane\u00a0loses\u00a0its\u00a0capability\u00a0to\u00a0reject\u00a0ions\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0feed\u00a0solution.\u00a0From\u00a0these\u00a0results,\u00a0 it\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0inferred\u00a0that\u00a0the\u00a0PI\u00a0membrane\u00a0has\u00a0a\u00a0certain\u00a0tolerance\u00a0for\u00a0acid,\u00a0but\u00a0beyond\u00a0this\u00a0 range,\u00a0the\u00a0membrane\u00a0degrades\u00a0under\u00a0acidic\u00a0conditions.\u00a0 \u00a0\nFigure\u00a02.\u00a0(a)\u00a0Flux\u00a0and\u00a0(b)\u00a0MgSO4\u00a0rejection\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0PI\u00a0membrane\u00a0after\u00a0long\u2010term\u00a0exposure\u00a0to\u00a015\u00a0w/v%\u00a0\nH2SO4.\u00a0(c)\u00a0Normalized\u00a0flux\u00a0and\u00a0(d)\u00a0normalized\u00a0rejection\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0PI\u00a0membrane\u00a0after\u00a0exposure\u00a0to\u00a050\u00a0\nw/v%\u00a0H2SO4.\u00a0\nTo\u00a0ensure\u00a0that\u00a0the\u00a0experiment\u00a0is\u00a0systematic\u00a0and\u00a0time\u2010efficient,\u00a0the\u00a0concentration\u00a0of\u00a0 H2SO4\u00a0was\u00a0 increased\u00a0to\u00a050\u00a0w/v%.\u00a0The\u00a0pH\u00a0of\u00a050\u00a0w/v%\u00a0H2SO4\u00a0was\u00a0\u22120.7~\u22120.8.\u00a0The\u00a0perfor\u2010 mance\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0acid\u2010exposed\u00a0membrane\u00a0was\u00a0expressed\u00a0as\u00a0the\u00a0normalized\u00a0flux\u00a0and\u00a0normal\u2010 ized\u00a0rejection\u00a0and\u00a0compared\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0performance\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0pristine\u00a0membrane.\u00a0The\u00a0normal\u2010 ized\u00a0flux\u00a0after\u00a0exposure\u00a0to\u00a050\u00a0w/v%\u00a0H2SO4\u00a0for\u00a0various\u00a0time\u00a0intervals\u00a0is\u00a0shown\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a02c.\u00a0 The\u00a0flux\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0PI\u00a0membrane\u00a0after\u00a0exposure\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0acidic\u00a0solution\u00a0for\u00a01,\u00a02,\u00a04,\u00a0or\u00a08\u00a0h\u00a0increased\u00a0 to\u00a0139,\u00a0149,\u00a0205,\u00a0and\u00a0278%,\u00a0respectively,\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0normalized\u00a0rejection,\u00a0as\u00a0shown\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a0 2d,\u00a0decreased\u00a0to\u00a060,\u00a060,\u00a044,\u00a0and\u00a028%,\u00a0respectively.\u00a0Thus,\u00a0the\u00a0damage\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0PI\u00a0membrane\u00a0 is\u00a0strongly\u00a0dependent\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0exposure\u00a0time.\u00a0Exposure\u00a0to\u00a050\u00a0w/v%\u00a0H2SO4\u00a0for\u00a04\u00a0h\u00a0was\u00a0used\u00a0 as\u00a0the\u00a0standard\u00a0exposure\u00a0condition\u00a0in\u00a0further\u00a0experiments.\u00a0 \u00a0\n3.2.\u00a0Fenton\u00a0Reaction\u00a0to\u00a0Improve\u00a0acid\u00a0Resistance\u00a0of\u00a0PI\u00a0Membranes\u00a0 The\u00a0performance\u00a0of\u00a0pristine,\u00a0modified,\u00a0and\u00a0acid\u2010exposed\u00a0membranes\u00a0 is\u00a0shown\u00a0 in\u00a0 Figure\u00a03.\u00a0After\u00a0exposure\u00a0to\u00a050\u00a0w/v%\u00a0H2SO4,\u00a0the\u00a0normalized\u00a0flux\u00a0increased\u00a0to\u00a0205%,\u00a0and\u00a0 the\u00a0normalized\u00a0rejection\u00a0decreased\u00a0to\u00a044%\u00a0(dashed\u00a0line\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a03),\u00a0indicating\u00a0that\u00a0the\u00a0PI\u00a0 membrane\u00a0was\u00a0damaged\u00a0by\u00a0acid\u00a0exposure.\u00a0When\u00a0ferrous\u00a0ions\u00a0(Fe2+)\u00a0are\u00a0added\u00a0to\u00a0H2O2\u00a0\nTo ensure that the experi t i t tic and time-efficient, the concentration of H2SO4 as i crease to 50 w/v%. The pH of 50 w/v% H2SO4 was \u22120.7~\u22120.8. The performance of the acid-exposed membrane was expressed as the normalized flux and normalized rejection and compared to the performance of the pristine membrane. The normalized flux after exposure to 50 w/v% H2SO4 for various time intervals is shown in Figure 2c. The flux of the PI membrane after exposure to the acidic solution for 1, 2, 4, or 8 h increased to 139, 149, 205, and 278%, respectively, and the normalized rejection, as shown in Figure 2d, decreased to 60, 60, 44, and 28%, respectively. Thus, the damage to the PI membrane is strongly dependent on the exposure time. Exposure to 50 w/v% H2SO4 for 4 h was used as the standard exposure condition in further experiments."

            "text": "The performance of pristine, odified, and acid-exposed membranes is shown in Figure 3. After exposure to 50 w/v% H2SO4, the normalized flux increased to 205%, and the normalized rejection decreased to 44% (dashed line in Figure 3), indicating that the PI membrane was damaged by acid exposure. When ferrous ions (Fe2+) are added to H2O2 solution, ferrous ions are oxidized to ferric ions (Fe3+), and H2O2 is converted into hydroxyl free radicals and hydroxyl anions. Then, the ferric ions are again reduced to ferrous ions, generating protons and hydroperoxyl free radicals from other H2O2 molecules (Figure 4) [35,36]. Iron ions serve as catalysts for the generation of free radicals during the reaction. The generated free radicals reacted with the PI to lower the flux and slightly increase the rejection. This is likely due to the cross-linking of the membrane. More details on the reaction mechanism are provided in the analysis of ATR-FTIR spectra. The change in the pore size of the membrane by the Fenton reaction was evaluated through the rejection of a neutral solute passing through the membrane. The molecular weight of the solute at which the rejection reaches 90% is called MWCO. Figure 5 shows the rejection of PEG solutes with various molecular weights for both pristine and Fentonmodified PI membranes. The rejection of both membranes increases with increasing molecular weight of the PEG solute from 400 to 1200 Da. The MWCO of the pristine PI membrane was ~1060 Da, whereas that of the Fenton post-treated PI membrane was\nPolymers 2023, 15, 264 7 of 15\n~920 Da. These values correspond to the mean pore size of ~0.81 and ~0.74 nm, respectively. The reduction of pore size by the Fenton reaction explains the decrease in flux and a slight increase in the rejection, as shown in Figure 3.\nPolymers\u00a02023,\u00a015,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 7\u00a0 of\u00a0 16\u00a0

Fent n-modified membran t 50 w/v% H2SO4 resulted in 7% and 4% inc ases in normalized fl x and rejecti n, respectively. Compared with the pristine membrane, the modified membrane showed little hange in performance after exposure to H2SO4. Thus, Fenton modification enhanced the acid resistance of the membrane. The structure of PI membranes was characterized using SEM. Cross-sectional SEM images of pristine and Fenton-modified PI membranes after exposure to 50 w/v% H2SO4 for 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8 h are shown in Figure 6. As the exposure time to the H2SO4 solution increases, the pore size of the pristine PI membrane also increases. This indicates that harsh acidic conditions led to polymer degradation. This result is consistent with the deterioration of the membrane performance shown by the increase in flux and decrease in the rejection upon exposure to acid (Figure 2). However, the pore size of the Fenton-modified membrane did not increase with the exposure time to the H2SO4 solution. Therefore, the Fentonmodified membrane has superior acid resistance, which is attributed to the cross-linking of the PI membrane by the Fenton modification.\nPolymers 2023, 15, 264 8 of 15\nPolymers\u00a02023,\u00a015,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 8\u00a0 of\u00a0 16\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nThese\u00a0values\u00a0correspond\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0mean\u00a0pore\u00a0size\u00a0of\u00a0~0.81\u00a0and\u00a0~0.74\u00a0nm,\u00a0respectively.\u00a0The\u00a0 reduction\u00a0of\u00a0pore\u00a0size\u00a0by\u00a0the\u00a0Fenton\u00a0reaction\u00a0explains\u00a0the\u00a0decrease\u00a0 in\u00a0flux\u00a0and\u00a0a\u00a0slight\u00a0 increase\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0rejection,\u00a0as\u00a0shown\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a03.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFigure\u00a05.\u00a0PEGs\u00a0rejection\u00a0curves\u00a0of\u00a0pristine\u00a0and\u00a0Fenton\u2010modified\u00a0PI\u00a0membranes\u00a0for\u00a0MWCO\u00a0meas\u2010\nurement.\u00a0\nAt\u00a0the\u00a0same\u00a0time,\u00a0exposure\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0Fenton\u2010modified\u00a0membrane\u00a0to\u00a050\u00a0w/v%\u00a0H2SO4\u00a0re\u2010 sulted\u00a0in\u00a07%\u00a0and\u00a04%\u00a0increases\u00a0in\u00a0normalized\u00a0flux\u00a0and\u00a0rejection,\u00a0respectively.\u00a0Compared\u00a0 with\u00a0the\u00a0pristine\u00a0membrane,\u00a0the\u00a0modified\u00a0membrane\u00a0showed\u00a0little\u00a0change\u00a0in\u00a0performance\u00a0 after\u00a0exposure\u00a0to\u00a0H2SO4.\u00a0Thus,\u00a0Fenton\u00a0modification\u00a0enhanced\u00a0the\u00a0acid\u00a0resistance\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0 membrane.\u00a0 \u00a0\nThe\u00a0structure\u00a0of\u00a0PI\u00a0membranes\u00a0was\u00a0characterized\u00a0using\u00a0SEM.\u00a0Cross\u2010sectional\u00a0SEM\u00a0 images\u00a0of\u00a0pristine\u00a0and\u00a0Fenton\u2010modified\u00a0PI\u00a0membranes\u00a0after\u00a0exposure\u00a0to\u00a050\u00a0w/v%\u00a0H2SO4\u00a0 for\u00a00,\u00a01,\u00a02,\u00a04,\u00a0and\u00a08\u00a0h\u00a0are\u00a0shown\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a06.\u00a0As\u00a0the\u00a0exposure\u00a0time\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0H2SO4\u00a0solution\u00a0 increases,\u00a0 the\u00a0pore\u00a0size\u00a0of\u00a0 the\u00a0pristine\u00a0PI\u00a0membrane\u00a0also\u00a0 increases.\u00a0This\u00a0 indicates\u00a0 that\u00a0 harsh\u00a0acidic\u00a0conditions\u00a0led\u00a0to\u00a0polymer\u00a0degradation.\u00a0This\u00a0result\u00a0is\u00a0consistent\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0de\u2010 terioration\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0membrane\u00a0performance\u00a0shown\u00a0by\u00a0the\u00a0increase\u00a0in\u00a0flux\u00a0and\u00a0decrease\u00a0in\u00a0 the\u00a0rejection\u00a0upon\u00a0exposure\u00a0to\u00a0acid\u00a0(Figure\u00a02).\u00a0However,\u00a0the\u00a0pore\u00a0size\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0Fenton\u2010mod\u2010 ified\u00a0membrane\u00a0did\u00a0not\u00a0increase\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0exposure\u00a0time\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0H2SO4\u00a0solution.\u00a0Therefore,\u00a0 the\u00a0Fenton\u2010modified\u00a0membrane\u00a0has\u00a0superior\u00a0acid\u00a0resistance,\u00a0which\u00a0 is\u00a0attributed\u00a0 to\u00a0 the\u00a0 cross\u2010linking\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0PI\u00a0membrane\u00a0by\u00a0the\u00a0Fenton\u00a0modification.\u00a0 \u00a0\nFigure 7 shows the FTIR spectra of the DuraMem\u00ae900 PI membranes. Symmetric C=O stretching and C\u2013N\u2013C stretching of the imide peak are observed at 1720 cm\u22121 and at 1360 cm\u22121, respectively [19,20]. The peak of O\u2013H stretching is distributed at 2500\u20133300 cm\u22121 [37], and the peaks of the CONH structure of the amide group, known as amide I and amide II bands, are observed at 1650 and 1540 cm\u22121, respectively [21]. The amide I band was mainly attributed to C=O stretching, and the amide II band was ascribed to the combination of N\u2013H in-plane bending and N\u2013C stretching of the amide bond [38]. Both imide and imide functional groups were also detected in the pristine PI membranes. In the Fenton-modified membrane, the peak of O\u2013H stretching located between 3300 and 2500 cm\u22121 is more pronounced, and the CO peak of the secondary alcohol at 1100 cm\u22121 [39,40] is significantly more intense than in the pristine membrane. The PI membrane used in this study was a DuraMem\u00ae900 PI membrane (Evonik), which is a commercially av ilable organic-solvent-r sistant membrane. In the post-treatment for imparting orga ic solvent resistance to PI membranes, imide functional groups are commonly converted into amide and carboxylic groups [19]. When PI is immersed in an alkaline solution, the imide ring can be broken to form polyamic acid, which can react with other amines to form polyamide functional group [41]. According to ATR-FTIR, the organic-solvent-resistant PI membrane contains both amide and imide groups. It has been reported that amide bonds are vulnerable to acids [12,29]. The hydrolysis of amides begins when (i) the proton attacks the oxygen or nitrogen of the amide bond, followed by (ii) nucleophilic addition of water molecules to form a dihydroxy tetrahedral intermediate structure, (iii) transfer of the hydroxyl group from the oxygen to the nitrogen of the amide bond, and (iv) breakage of the amide bond [13,30]. During Fenton post-treatment of the membrane, the amine of the amide functional group can be attacked by hydroxyl radicals produced by Fenton reagents, leading to the radicalization of the amine. The radicalized amines react with each other to form a cross-linking bond (Figure 8). The cross-linking of the membrane might enhance the acid resistance of the membrane. The degree of stability of the amide bond is affected by the resonance between the electrons of the C=O \u03c0-bond and lone pair electrons of nitrogen [14]. When the nitrogen atoms of the amide bonds are bonded to each other (\u2013CO\u2013 .. N\u2013 .. N\u2013O\u2013) by Fenton post-treatment, the resonance structures of the two amide bonds overlap and expand, thereby strengthening the resonance structure and enhancing the acid tolerance of the membrane.\nPolymers 2023, 15, 264 9 of 15 Polymers\u00a02023,\u00a015,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 9\u00a0 of\u00a0 16\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Figure\u00a06.\u00a0SEM\u00a0 images\u00a0of\u00a0pristine\u00a0and\u00a0Fenton\u2010modified\u00a0PI\u00a0membranes\u00a0after\u00a0exposure\u00a0to\u00a050\u00a0w/v%\u00a0 H2SO4\u00a0for\u00a00,\u00a01,\u00a02,\u00a04,\u00a0and\u00a08\u00a0h.\u00a0Figure 6.

surface chemistry changes in the PI embrane owing th Fenton post-treatment were evaluated using XPS, and the results are shown in Table 1. The elemental composition of the pristine membrane was 73.0% carbon, 10.7% nitrogen, and 16.3% oxygen. However, in the Fenton-modified membrane, the atomic percentage of oxygen is significantly higher (58.3%). This result can be explained by the increase in the contents of hydroxyl and carboxylic functional groups generated in the PI membrane during the oxidation by H2O2 [42,43], as shown in the ATR-FTIR spectra (Figure 7). The decrease in the atomic percentages of carbon and nitrogen is attributed to the decrease in the total carbon and nitrogen content owing to the significantly increased oxygen content.\nPolymers 2023, 15, 264 11 of 15\nreaction. The effect of the cross-linking of the PI membrane can also be observed by its solubility in polar aprotic solvents such as DMAc. Figure 9b shows the residual weight of the pristine and Fenton-modified membranes after the solvent exposure test. The pristine PI membrane retained 69.4% of its original weight after soaking at 80 \u25e6C for 20 h, whereas the Fenton-modified membrane retained 81.6%, demonstrating successful cross-linking and enhanced solvent resistance compared to that of the pristine membrane. Thus, Fenton post-treatment not only increased the acid resistance but also further improved the thermal stability and organic solvent resistance.

Compared to other studies, the Fenton method requires less time for modification (1 h) and uses green solvents and non-toxic chemicals. The Fenton reaction of DuraMem\u00ae PI is a facil and sustainable process to enhance the acid resistance of PI membr ne for the treatment of solutions containing organic solvents and strong acids.\nPolymers 2023, 15, 264 12 of 15"

            "text": "In this study, the DuraMem\u00ae 900 PI membrane was modified using the strong oxidizing agent generated by the green solvent-based Fenton reaction. Pristine PI membrane exhibited a flux increase to 205% and a decrease in rejection to 44% after exposure to 50 w/v% H2SO4 at 25 \u25e6C for 4 h, which was used as the evaluation standard for acid resistance. These changes resulted from the degradation of the PI membrane in low pH environment. Fenton post-treatment induced cross-linking of the PI membrane, thereby reducing the flux and increasing the rejection. However, exposure of the Fenton-modified membrane to H2SO4 led to only a slight increase in flux and almost no changes in rejection. The modification through the Fenton reaction significantly improved the acid resistance of the PI membrane. The Fenton post-treatment of the PI membrane not only increased the acid resistance but also improved its thermal stability and organic solvent resistance. Furthermore, the performance of the acid-resistant and organic-solvent-resistant PI membranes was controlled using the MPD additive, thereby extending the application scope of the PI membrane modified via Fenton post-treatment.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, Y.-N.K.; methodology, W.-S.K. and H.-K.L.; formal analysis, Y.-I.P., H.P. and I.-C.K.; investigation, S.R., W.-S.K. and H.-K.L.; resources, Y.-I.P., H.P. and I.-C.K.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, S.R. and W.-S.K.; writing\u2014review and editing, S.R. and Y.-N.K.; supervision, Y.-N.K.; funding acquisition, Y.-N.K.
