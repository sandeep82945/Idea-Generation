    "abstractText": "Worldwide demand for oil, coal, and natural gas has increased recently because of odd weather patterns and economies recovering from the pandemic. By using these fuels at an astonishing rate, their reserves are running low with each passing decade. Increased reliance on these sources is contributing significantly to both global warming and power shortage problems. It is vital to highlight and focus on using renewable energy sources for power production and storage. This review aims to discuss one of the cutting-edge technologies, metal\u2013air batteries, which are currently being researched for energy storage applications. A battery that employs an external cathode of ambient air and an anode constructed of pure metal in which an electrolyte can be aqueous or aprotic electrolyte is termed as a metal\u2013air battery (MAB). Due to their reportedly higher energy density, MABs are frequently hailed as the electrochemical energy storage of the future for applications like grid storage or electric car energy storage. The demand of the upcoming energy storage technologies can be satisfied by these MABs. The usage of metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) in metal\u2013air batteries as a bi-functional electrocatalyst has been widely studied in the last decade. Metal ions or arrays bound to organic ligands to create one, two, or three-dimensional structures make up the family of molecules known as MOFs. They are a subclass of coordination polymers; metal nodes and organic linkers form different classes of these porous materials. Because of their modular design, they offer excellent synthetic tunability, enabling precise chemical and structural control that is highly desirable in electrode materials of MABs.",

Excess global warming is disturbing the whole ecosystem: marine life, wildlife, humans etc. The amount of water in the world's oceans and seas is rising owing to melting of glaciers, sea ice and polar ice sheets brought on by warmer temperatures. Extreme nancial setbacks might result from extreme weather. In addition to rising house and health insurance costs for customers, food and energy prices are also rising. Factors including declining tourism and industrial protability, rising energy, food, and water needs, disaster cleanup, and border tensions have an impact on governments and then on our economy.1\u20133 This has sparked considerable research into renewable and ecologically suitable energy sources. Effective energy storage systems must be created to put new sustainable energy sources in use efficiently. By offering sustainable power sources and fuel diversity, renewable energy sources improve energy security, lower the possibility of fuel leaks, and decrease the requirement for imported fuels. The nation's natural resources are also protected using these green energy sources. High demand can be reduced via energy storage, and any cost savings might be passed on to consumers. Energy storage can assist in meeting peak energy demands in highly populated places, reducing grid load and price increases.4,5\nEnvironmental degradation outweighs fossil fuels against renewable energy sources. Systems for storing energy can aid in the switching to renewable energy sources from fossil fuels. Due to the negative environmental effects of greenhouse gases (GHG) created by fossil fuels, electric power generation is altering drastically all over the world. By implementing energy storage systems (ESSs), the unpredictable daily and seasonal variations in electrical energy consumption can be addressed, reducing the additional GHG emissions into the atmosphere. Mechanical, electrochemical, chemical, thermal, and other energy storage methods are all possible. When there is an imbalance between supply and demand, energy storage systems\nDr Naseem Iqbal works as Professor at USPCAS-E, National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST).

Strongly reliant on weather resources with sporadic and variable characteristics are solar and wind energy. With benets like quick response time, sustained power delivery, and regional independence, battery energy storage systems have gained widespread acceptance among the possible methods to solve this problem of power shortage.8\nNickel\u2013cadmium, lead-acid, sodium\u2013sulfur metal\u2013air, lithium-ion, and other types of energy storage batteries are commonly employed for this purpose since they compared to engines and turbines, exhibit faster charge and discharge characteristics.9,10 One of the best ways to store energy is using batteries, which come in a variety of shapes and sizes. The primary focus of this review article will be metal\u2013air batteries, which harness the energy of atmospheric oxygen to create power. This has the benet that the oxygen does not need to be preserved inside the battery, unlike a standard alkaline or Li-ion battery (LIB). The theoretical specic energy of these metal\u2013air batteries is noticeably (3\u201330 times) greater than that of Li-ion batteries. Because safer aqueous electrolytes are employed, these batteries are also intrinsically safe in that they won't catch on re or explode while in use. Due to their comparably high energy density, exible metal\u2013air batteries have attracted a lot of attention lately and may compete with them for use in wearable or roll-up electronic devices. Flexible nonaqueous LIBs, aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs), and aqueous aluminum\u2013air (AlBs) batteries are a few examples of metal\u2013air batteries that have recently been produced.11,12\nResearchers are keen to nd cleaner energy technologies for storing and converting energy, including the smart grid, due to the effects of global warming and the shiing price of oil.

LIBs, which have a higher energy density than more traditional power sources like Ni-MH batteries, are projected to be able to meet these demands. However, electrode materials with a complex chemistry have a restriction on the highest energy density of modern lithiumion batteries, making them unsuitable for use in actual electric car applications. Metal\u2013air batteries have generated a lot of interest as a potential alternative due to their incredibly high energy density in comparison to traditional rechargeable batteries.13,14 For Li\u2013air batteries, it is possible to prevent unfavorable reactions and issues with electrolyte deterioration brought on by organic solvents by employing aqueous lithium salt solutions as the electrolytes. Aqueous electrolytes have a small potential window, which restricts their use in Li-based batteries. When employing high concentration hydrate-melt or water-in-salt (WiS) electrolytes, for example, one can get aqueous electrolytes to operate at high voltages by eliminating free water molecules from the electrolyte.15\nWe will also go over the application of MOFs and their derivatives which are being researched as prospective electrode materials because of their vast specic surface areas, numerous modular and programmable topologies, and enormous internal pore volume in metal\u2013air batteries. Due to their tunable pore widths and metal ions with redox activities, huge specic surface areas and enormous internal pore volumes have made MOFs gain a lot of interest recently as electrode materials with high energy capacities.16,17 An open framework that may be permeable characterizes the structure of MOFs (porous materials). This type of MOF was initially recognized and described by the Yaghi team in 1995.18 A coordination bond between a key core metal ion and a bolstering organic ligand self-assembles in this organic\u2013inorganic hybrid material. The MOF has signicantly changed over time, beginning with its rst direct synthesis, and ending with its current broad utilization. When compared to weak bonds like hydrogen bonds and van der Waals bonds, MOFs' coordination bond energy is much larger (usually 60\u2013350 kJ mol\u22121). MOFs are stable, as a result they can create permanent pores.19\nFurthermore, MOFs' structure, as well as their physical and chemical characteristics, are highly designable. Researchers have developed more than 20 000 MOFs since the MOF was coined; this numerical gure is continually rising. This is due to the fact that these various center-metal ions can combine with a wide range of organic ligands to generate a vast variety of MOF compounds.20 Zhang et al. created the PCN-128Wmetal\u2013organic framework in 2015 with the use of zirconium salt and chromophoric linker. The emission maximum shis from 470 to 538 nm, and the hue of PCN-128W reversibly changes from white to yellow. This piezouorochromic behavior is quite fascinating. Fluorescence spectroscopy was used to track the stepwise uorescence change, and it showed that consecutive compression gradually shied the emission maximum. To get profound understanding of the piezouorochromic process, structural studies are conducted on both the white and yellow phases.21\nRecently, there has been a lot of interest in rechargeable sodium\u2013air batteries (SABs), which have a high theoretical\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Based on the electrolytes utilized in the system, SABs are categorized into two classes: nonaqueous and aqueous/hybrid. The electrochemical performance of non-aqueous SABs is constrained by the insolubility of solid discharge products like Na2O and Na2O2, which impedes long-term operation by fouling the air electrode. The potential of carbon nanostructures produced from MOF as non-noble metal-based oxygen electrocatalysts for metal\u2013air batteries was investigated by Yuqi Wu et al. For the rst time, hybrid sodium\u2013 air batteries (SABs) with N-doped carbon nanotubes (MOFNCNTs) (OER) have shown improved electrocatalytic activity and stability for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution process.22,23\nThe sole purpose of this review is to provide the most recent developments in MOF-based materials utilized in MABs. A lot of signicant factors that have a major impact on how active water splitting reactions are discussed along with how to construct catalysts. In addition to a summary of the major challenges in the areas of photocatalytic and electrocatalytic water splitting, some information on recent developments in the production of MOF-based catalysts has also been included. Future research objectives are listed, with an emphasis on achieving the required. For identifying and comprehending the factors inuencing catalytic activity, MOF functionality and framework correlations are being developed. This paper highlights recent developments in this rapidly growing eld and offers some suggestions for constructing extremely effective photo- and electrocatalysts for water splitting/redox reactions that are based on electrode made of MOFs which take place inside MABs.24,25"

Additional benets of Zn include its abundance, affordable, environmentally friendly, low equilibrium potential, at discharge voltage, and long-time span of usability.

Traditional rechargeable batteries have a closed system for their cell arrangement. These batteries come in countless variations based on different metal types, and additional cell components are needed because of their unique reaction kinetics. Based on their electrolytes, these batteries are typically divided into two categories, the rst is a cell structure that is impervious to moisture and operates with an aqueous electrolyte. The alternative approach makes use of an electrolyte and aprotic solvents and is water sensitive, but moisture damages this type of system.28,29 The two main chemical reactions in metal\u2013air batteries are the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during charging and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) during discharging.30\nThe creation of extremely effective bifunctional electrocatalysts that perform with outstanding chemical stability in electrolytes containing oxygen is the main problem in the development of metal\u2013air battery technology. Although precious metals like Pt, Ru, and Ir are known to be efficient electrocatalysts for ORR and OER, their high cost has hindered their widespread accessibility. Recent studies have demonstrated the efficiency and affordability of carbon nanomaterials as platinum alternatives for ORR, including carbon nanotubes, porous carbon, carbon nitride, and N-doped graphene. The surface polarity and electrical properties of nitrogen can be modied by co-doping it with another heteroatom, such as S or P, which increases ORR catalytic activity. However, the OER activity of the bulk of these metal-free catalysts is subpar. The most efficient OER electrocatalysts to date, according to some research, are constructed using transitionmetal hydroxides and oxides.31,32\nA feasible method for using air as an electrode for batteries has long been desired by the battery industry. Theoretically, air is a material with no cost. If there were no obstacles to enhancing the practical specic energy, specic power, and cycle life of these batteries which commonly comprise earthabundant components like Zn, Al, Mg, Si, C, Mn, as mentioned before their market price would be far lower.33 Despite the existence of metal\u2013air batteries for more than a century, their application has been constrained by the performance and stability of the electrodes, electrolyte, and cell design. Recently, aqueous metal\u2013air batteries have undergone signicant advancements due to the necessary components that assist the enhancement of long-term\nTable 1 Various metal\u2013air batteries' energy densities.37\nBattery type Open circuit potential (volts) Energy density (W h L\u22121) Energy density (W h kg\u22121)\nZn\u2013air 1.68 5960 1045 Li\u2013air 2.96 6102 3458 Fe\u2013air 1.35 1431 763 Mg\u2013air 3.08 12 200 3991 Ca\u2013air 3.10 9960 2980 Al\u2013air 2.71 14 100 4116\n1140 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 1137\u20131161\nstability and the demonstration of superior electrochemical performance.34\u201336\nTable 1 compares energy density and open potential circuit of different MABs and showcasing that AlB has the highest value for energy density whereas iron air batteries have lowest. Not only does this iron air battery also has lowest potential value where cadmium air batteries having highest which is 3.10 volts. Batteries use chemical energy to store electrical energy. Because they have a theoretically higher density than lithium-ion batteries, metal\u2013air batteries are being researched. An Mdenoted metal anode is oxidized, releasing metal ions (M+), which travel through the electrolyte to the cathode and react with oxygen to form metal oxides as shown in the equations below.36,38 The metal on the anode oxidizes during discharge to release electrons, and the liberated metal ions mix with the hydroxide ions to form metal hydroxide:\nM + nOH\u2212 / M(OH)n + ne \u2212 (1)\nIn the next step hydroxide ions are created when oxygen molecules from the atmosphere react with water on the cathode, incoming electrons, and water.

One of the essential parts of a metal\u2013air battery is the air cathode, and reliable air electrodes guarantee that the battery operates effectively and consistently. An effective air electrode should typically have quick OH-migration, alkaline condition, good electrochemical stability.39 Oxygen evolution and reduction exhibit considerable electrochemical activity in rechargeable batteries as well as primary metal\u2013air batteries (especially under high potentials). The design of air electrodes is hindered by these contradicting and difficult requirements. According to the literature, the development of air electrodes with improved catalytic activity, longer life, and lower production costs has thus been the main emphasis of metal\u2013air battery research over the past 50 years.40,41\nWe have discussed almost all metal\u2013air batteries in this section but, in this paper, our primary focus will be on the most common ones which are lithium and zinc air batteries.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

As a technology for energy storage, LABs have generated interest due to their high energy and power density. By surpassing the energy capabilities of traditional LIBs, these batteries are anticipated to revolutionize both the electrochemical energy storage systems and the automotive sector (for usage in electric and hybrid vehicles). Non-aqueous (aprotic) solvents, aqueous solvents, and hybrid (non-aqueous/aqueous/aqueous) solvents are the basic types of Li\u2013air batteries as shown in Fig. 1 below it basically represents overall conguration of these batteries. Li salts are dissolved in all solid-state electrolytes. The anode and cathode materials in each of the four systems are formed of lithiummetal and oxygen gas, respectively. Nevertheless, the type of electrolyte utilized affects how they react. Non-aqueous LIBs have porous cathodes where oxygen is reduced and converted to solid Li2O2. As a result, the main constraints limiting the capacity of this battery system are the solid product obstruction and/or passivation of active surfaces at the porous cathode. The conguration of the non-aqueous electrolyte system is similar to that of traditional LIBs.42,43\nLike standard LIBs, the non-aqueous electrolyte system is congured. Anodes composed of carbon or alloy materials, cathodes constructed of Li metal oxides or phosphates, and electrolytes formed of aprotic solvents in which Li salt is dissolved are all used in conventional batteries. Because oxygen gas acts as the cathode in Li\u2013air batteries, porous carbon\nFig. 1 Schematic cell configurations for the three main types of Li\u2013air ba Library.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Since anodes are the lithium source in these batteries, this metal must be employed as the anode here. The primary difference between the two systems is that Li\u2013air batteries need an open system. Additional parts, including air-dehydration membranes, are needed for an open system. Li2O2 is a precipitate that forms when Li+ ions near the air cathode's surface in Li\u2013air batteries interact with oxide ions.42,44 Compared to previous rechargeable battery systems like nickel\u2013cadmium or lead-acid, LIBs and LABs batteries offer a higher energy density, which has led to their signicant success in the eld of portable devices.45\nSignicant research is currently being conducted on them with the goal of storing energy produced by electric vehicles as well as renewable energy sources like solar and wind energy.

New battery chemistries in addition to the next generation of electrochemical energy storage devices will require Li-ion technology. Due to its high specic gravity, lithiummetal is themost promising anode material for high energy density batteries.

The simplest net reaction envisioned for the aprotic battery is a twoelectron process:\n2Li + O2 / Li2O2 (4)\nLi2O2 / 2Li + O2 (5)\nThe basic processes in an aqueous cathode electrolyte are:\n2Li\u00fe 1\n2\nO2 \u00fe 2H\u00fe/2Li\u00fe \u00feH2O \u00f0acidic media\u00de\n2Li\u00fe 1\n2\nO2 \u00feH2O/2LiOH \u00f0alkaline media\u00de\nThe chemistry of the all-solid-state battery is most likely equivalent to the aprotic electrolyte battery, despite not yet being known. Due to its advantageous energy density and durability, LIBs are the ideal option for energy storage in portable devices. For usage as power sources for electric vehicles and smart grids, batteries must have a long lifespan, a high energy density, continuous safety performance, and a low price.50 Electrolyte additives have greatly improved in their ability to handle the problems with conventional electrolytes that lead to substandard cycle performance and unwanted gas generation because of advancements in electrode materials. The capacity of the cathode and anode materials, as well as the operating voltage, have a major impact on the energy density of LIBs. Reversible battery operation requires long-term electrode\u2013 electrolyte interfacial stability, even if high-energy-density LIBs can be created utilizing high-capacity electrode materials and a high operating voltage. Electrolyte additives' formation of electrochemically resistant interfacial layers and preservation of the interfacial structures of electrodes for high-performance LIBs will be advantageous for high-capacity electrodes to achieve electrochemical reversibility.51\nLarge pore volumes, clearly dened pores, and evenly dispersed catalysts are characteristics of materials generated from MOF that are benecial for large-scale transportation, redox processes involving oxygen discharged products (e.g., lithium oxide). One such substance, a cage-type graphitic porous carbon-Co3O4 (GPC-Co3O4) polyhedron made from core\u2013shell MOFs (ZIF-8@ZIF-67), provided low charge potentials and an exceptional cycle life when utilized as a cathode substance for lithium batteries. This was made feasible thanks to the advantages of the graphitic carbon component, which improves conductivity, and the cage-type and mesoporous structures, which can bind to Li2O2.52 Graphene/graphene-tube nanocomposites, cobalt\u2013manganese oxide, Co9S8@carbon porous nanocages, Fe2O3/carbon, and ZnO/ZnFe2O4/C nanocages are also listed as cathode materials for LABs.53\n1142 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 1137\u20131161\nLi2O2 may cause the carbon components of materials made from MOFs to break down, resulting in low cycle stability. To help in the development of suitable MOF-derived materials for use in real-world LABs, it would be wonderful to have a deeper knowledge of the fundamental chemistry of LABs. Due to their incredibly high theoretical capacities and energy densities, rechargeable LIBs and LABs are one of the most promising power sources for the upcoming generation of electric vehicles. The technology has gone through several revisions over the years, but signicant problems still need to be resolved before it can be successfully marketed. A few concerns that need to be resolved include its practicality, round-trip effectiveness, and riding time. The advantages of this type of battery are discussed in this review. The battery's electrolyte and electrode optimization are considered at the system level of design.

Oxygen cannot be used as a liquid at atmospheric pressure due to its extremely low solubility; rather, it must be employed as a gas. The catalyst then aids in reducing oxygen to hydroxyl ions in the alkaline electrolyte by using the electrons produced by the oxidation of zinc metal as the anode process. Due to the fact that the catalyst, electrolyte, and oxygen are all in three phases simultaneously, we refer to this process as a \u201cthree-phase reaction\u201d (gas).56 Zinc is oxidized with oxygen from the air in metal\u2013air batteries, such as non-rechargeable zinc\u2013air batteries and zinc\u2013air fuel cells, to generate power (mechanically rechargeable). These batteries are made at quite low prices and have great energy densities. From the comparatively small button cells used in hearing aids to the massive batteries used in grid-scale energy storage, batteries come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Additional battery sizes include those used in mercury-powered lm cameras and larger batteries for digital cameras. Interior and exterior of the cell, the porous carbon electrode can absorb atmospheric oxygen.48,57\nThese electrochemical processes taking place in the alkaline solution between the anode and cathode, which constitute the entire discharge process, are explained. How a zinc\u2013air battery works and how each electrode reacts. An electrolyte-saturated porous anode made of zinc particles forms aer discharge. To generate zinc hydroxide and release electrons to ow to the cathode, oxygen from the air and the cathode combine to make hydroxyl ions. Water is reintroduced into the electrolyte as the zincate converts to zinc oxide. The water is not used since the hydroxyl and water recycled at the cathode from the anode.58\nThe red circle in Fig. 2 above designates the position of this three-phase interaction. In zinc\u2013air batteries, oxygen absorption is facilitated by this shape. To nish the reaction, hydroxyl ions in the cell go from the zinc anode to the air cathode.

A higher potential is required for charging when the reverse process (the oxygen evolution reaction) is considered (blue line). It is clear from the preceding summary that using the ORR has advantages and disadvantages for zinc\u2013air cells. The positive point enables this cell to have a higher energy density despite the lack of oxygen active material. The subject has already been discussed. The zinc\u2013air cell experiences a considerable potential loss because of the negative point, which affects the cell's power density. As a result, many studies have concentrated on how to create novel catalysts and alter the designs of the air electrodes to lessen the signicant overpotential in the cathode reaction.62\nIn a primary zinc\u2013air cell, the zinc anode is not signicant since old zinc metal can be spontaneously replenished with new metal through electromechanical charging. To make a zinc\u2013air battery that can be electrically recharged, the electrochemical behavior of the zinc anode must be altered. The creation of a secondary zinc\u2013air battery may be hampered by other issues even if these two primary limitations of zinc\u2013air batteries are ignored.60,63 In zinc\u2013air batteries, the anode's active component is pure zinc metal, which oxidizes during discharge. Due to this, most of the research has concentrated on making the air electrode rather than the zinc anode. According to the equation Zn + 2H2O / Zn(OH)2 + H2, zinc corrodes at a slower pace than aluminum does in an alkaline solution, but hydrogen gas is still produced during this corrosion process (hydrogen evolution reaction, or HER). Considering zinc metal's electrochemistry in the alkaline electrolyte as opposed to just its electrochemistry in the gas phase makes more sense. The hydrogen evolution process (HER), which is not intended to take place during discharge, has been identied as the most critical area of study. It is envisioned that to gradually increase capacity of these\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nbatteries zinc metal should be utilized entirely during the process of discharging.58,64\nElectrolytes regulate the ion transport behavior in ZABs. The most advanced electrolytes for exible ZABs are hydrogels because of their cohesive exibility and capacity to transfer ions diffusively like liquids. The local segmental movements of polymer chains, which are responsive to temperature variations, are correlated with the ionic conductivity of hydrogel electrolytes. The hydrogel electrolytes also run the risk of becoming less exible and conductible at below-freezing temperatures because they are aqueous in nature. Recent studies have used low-molecular vicinal alcohols to generate organ hydrogels that can function at subzero temperatures by replacing some of the water in aqueous hydrogels. However, ORR/OER and the ionic conductivity of gel electrolytes are always degraded (or poisoned) by the addition of organic molecules. But the concentrated alkaline solute utilized in ZABs, enables the use of the solutions' natural capacity to collaborate to lessen the impacts of low temperatures. The introduction of potent alkaline solutions to hydrogel electrolytes can adversely compromise the structural integrity of polymer backbones. The interactions between the terminal groups on these hydrogel electrolytes' polymer backbones, the electrolyte ions, and the water are what keep them from freezing. Although this has not yet been veried, hydrogel electrolyte backbones for ZABs can adjust to low temperatures.63,65\nAqueous zinc\u2013air batteries are particularly commendable when working in high-temperature environments due to their inherent safety. However, the possibility of their functioning at high temperatures hasn't been studied very much. Systematically examining the practicability of high-temperature zinc\u2013air batteries is done here. To determine the positive and negative inuences of temperature, the impacts on the aqueous electrolyte, zinc anode, and air cathode are separated.

Additionally, zinc\u2013air batteries show that cycling is possible at 80 \u00b0C. This research shows how zinc\u2013air batteries may provide energy storage at high temperatures and directs future research into improved batteries toward challenging operating environments. Traditionally, the Zn\u2013air battery's performance-limiting electrode has been the air cathode. They are made by uniformly loading the proper electrocatalysts over porous gas diffusion layers that have been coated with polytetrauoroethylene (GDLs). Water retention (hydrophilic) and water repulsion (hydrophobic) characteristics in good GDLs are balanced. They have many gaselectrolyte-electrode triple-phase boundaries, a high current density of up to >1 A cm\u22122 and allow O2 gas to enter the system quickly. The primary factor accelerating the ORR and OER and, thus, affecting the total battery performance is electrocatalysts placed on GDLs (e.g., power density, energy efficiency and cycle life). You canmanually or electrically recharge zinc air batteries. Zn\u2013air batteries that are mechanically rechargeable can be recharged by replacing the anode and electrolyte with fresh ones. They are main rechargeable batteries that merely require ORR electrocatalysts to serve as the cathode.66,67"

When compared to an aluminium or zinc air battery, the iron\u2013air battery emits less energy, but it has the same charge and discharge characteristics and uses an excessive amount of electrode material. The projected operational voltage and capacity of an iron\u2013air battery are lower than those of an aluminium or zinc battery, thus this is accurate. However, compared to zinc\u2013air batteries or aluminum\u2013air batteries, iron\u2013air batteries are less likely to be used as primary batteries because the iron negative electrode's expected capacity and working voltage are lower than those of zinc and aluminium. Iron\u2013air batteries also have an abundance of electrode material. Iron's electrode response is also more difficult in several ways than zinc's, as this article has explained.68,69 Due to this, commercial iron\u2013air primary batteries are now extremely rare, and almost all of them feature a zinc negative electrode. The electrode reaction of iron in an alkaline electrolyte totally occurs in the solid state without engaging the deposition\u2013dissolution process because the discharge products from iron, such as iron hydroxides and iron oxides, are not highly soluble. Because of this iron feature, a negative electrode's tendency to change form over cycles is bad for primary batteries but good for secondary batteries.

Due to its lightness and toughness, aluminium is also well-known as a building and manufacturing material and is frequently used\n1144 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 1137\u20131161\nin industries like automation and construction. Due to the advancement of commercial alloys, metal\u2013air cells may be able to compete with established energy accumulating methods.71 Themain problem is that an oxide coating spontaneously forms on the electrode surface when Al is exposed to air or aqueous solutions. The active dissolving of aluminium is signicantly decreased by the presence of this protective oxide coating, which also positively affects the anode's corrosion potential. The amount of extractable energy is signicantly decreased by this alteration. Al quickly loses its attraction as a potential component of an energetic anode. Although it still has certain limitations, such as anode corrosion, slow discharge products, a high rate of self-discharge, cell irreversibility, and shelf life, the rechargeable Al\u2013air battery is one of the most promising technologies. By swapping out the current Al electrode, the battery system might be able to provide rapid mechanical recharging if electrochemical recharge is not available.72"

Electrocatalytic materials, which are not consumed during the reaction process, accelerate electrochemical reactions by interacting with reagents to change the reaction pathways and reduce the activation barrier. The majority of conventional single layer electrodes that have been created to date have substantial mass transport resistance and have subpar performance. The design of the double layer electrode also affects the reaction rate, most conventional single layer electrodes created to date have substantial mass transport resistance and have subpar performance. For ow batteries, a double-layer electrode has a backing layer and a catalyst layer. Therefore, by altering the electrocatalysts on the electrode surface, the electrochemical reaction rate can be managed.

To form molecular oxygen in OER, several proton/electron-coupled processes are necessary. Theoretically, a higher energy density might be achieved by using 4e\u2212 ORR rather than 2e\u2212. The properties of the electrode surface and any extra catalysts affect the complicated ORR path. The various critical steps of the multielectron reactions known as the ORR and the OER involve many reaction intermediates. The oxygen reduction reaction, sometimes referred to as the reduction half reaction, is a chemical process that turns oxygen (O2) into water or hydrogen peroxide. Oxygen consumption reaction.78 Electrocatalyst activity, affordability, toughness, and stability are crucial for practical application. Exceptional electrical conductivity, superior chemical stability in a range of electrolytes, and a strong catalyst support with a large surface area are also necessary. Metal oxide nanostructures can be regarded as an essential electrocatalytic material because of its very distinctive optical, electrical, andmolecular properties, easily functionalize nature, exceptional resistance to alkaline corrosion in an electrochemical environment, and other attributes.79\nTable 2 above shows that a high Tafel slope corresponds to a large band-gap energy, which results in a high overpotential\nFig. 3 Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction\nsince a lot of energy is required to produce activity and vice versa. The rate-determining phase of the electrochemical reaction is similarly described by the Tafel slope. The graph representing the relationship between the current produced in an electrochemical cell and the electrode potential of a specic metal is called a Tafel plot, which is frequently logarithmic. OER is a vital phase in energy conversion and storage, particularly in water electrolysis. Presently, the OER process makes extensive use of precious metals and their oxide complexes (Ir, Ru, IrO2, and RuO2) as cutting-edge catalysts to lower energy consumption and improve energy conversion efficiency.81 OER which provides the electrons needed for electrochemical conversion cycles between renewable electricity and chemical fuels, is signicantly reliant on these energy storage devices. In a metal\u2013 air battery, OER occurs on the cathode, and its activity and stability can be readily assessed. Electrocatalysts are necessary for MAB device charging and discharging as well as for critical electron transport, chemical bond formation, and rupturing.82\nElectrocatalysts can be used to increase the activity and stability of ORR and OER. Noble metals are effective oxygen evolution catalysts. However, they are unable to be reversible, which is required for all applications involving energy storage because only one sort of reaction is the focus of their high activity.

There is a constantly expanding interest in the creation of high-performance stable catalysts because these combinations and structures serve as the foundation for hybrid compositions, spinels, non-noble (mixed) transition metal oxides, and oxides of carbon.81,83\nIn OER, several proton/electron-coupled reactions are required to produce molecular oxygen. To enhance efficiency for practical applications, a full reduction is used. Furthermore, the slowness of OER and ORR reactions is well recognized. For OER and ORR to be benecial for energy storage devices like MABs, where OER occurs, it is imperative to keep in mind that oxygen molecules must renew when charging. A full water splitting process that utilizes a ground-based, dual-purpose electrocatalyst as both a cathode and anode. The development of inexpensive, effective, stable, and bifunctional electrocatalysts has attracted a lot of scientic interest, as have air battery-based energy storage technologies.84 The oxygen reduction reaction is a crucial electrochemical process for generating energy in fuel cells (ORR). Recently, this reaction has been enhanced by several study teams employing size-selected clusters. Fuel cells and metal\u2013air batteries both rely on the ORR. Although Pt-based nanoparticles exhibit excellent ORR activities, their high cost and limited shelf life preclude them from being widely used.85,86\nThe most difficult holdback of these advancements is the slow kinetics of electrochemical half-reactions like the (ORR) and (OER), which lowers the overall output efficiency throughout the process. Noble metal-based catalysts are frequently used to overcome these issues (such as Pt/C catalysts for ORR and Ru/Ir-based catalysts for OER), but their poor methanol tolerance, high cost, and low stability severely limit their future potential. The primary goal is to create a bifunctional catalyst with high catalytic activity and low-cost characteristics for the two distinct processes. A single active site catalyst is oen unable to provide strong bifunctional catalytic activity because ORR and OER use distinct routes. The hybrid or composite of Co2P/CoP is thus expected to demonstrate the enhanced bifunctional ORR/OER activity. CoP and Co2P can coexist thanks to an improved three-dimensional selfsupported electrocatalyst made of nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNT), which works by phosphorylating molecules at low temperatures rst. The resulting three-dimensional carbon network structure also enables rapid charge transfer. Additionally, the active sites of the carbon foam (CF) are greatly increased by hollow structural architecture.87 With only low overpotentials of 133 and 289 mV respectively, CoP/Co2P/ NCNT@CF displayed outstanding catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline media. The developed catalysts also have exceptional long-term stability; they continue to have signicant catalytic activity even aer 20 hours of continuous operation.88"

Due to their adaptability in terms of their chemistries and structural makeup MOFs have captivated the interest of scientists, engineers, and technologists ever since their discovery.89 The development of synthesis techniques has been the focus of countless studies and research publications since it directly affects how MOFs crystallize, which determines their characteristics and functional performance. MOFs can have multiple topologies for their frameworks, pore patterns, and sizes by selecting various metal centers and organic linkers. By chemically functionalizing linkers and subsequently applying modications, their chemical characteristics can be altered.90,91\nOne of the most common ligands utilized is the substance 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid, oen known as \u201cstruts\u201d or \u201clinkers\u201d (BDC). Metals are oen thought of as electron donors, whereas ligands are thought of as Lewis bases and acids. Among other things, ligands are classied according to their charge, size (bulk), kind of coordinating atom or atoms, quantity of electrons supplied to the metal, cone angle and other characteristics (denticity or hapticity), where cone angle is a measure of ligand magnitude.92 There are numerous alternate ranking systems for ligands and metal ions; one of them places emphasis on the \u201chardness\u201d of the ligand. Metal ions prefer certain ligands over others when binding. Strong-eld ligands bind metal ions in accordance with the Auau principle, while weak-eld ligands bind complexes in accordance with Hund's rule. In the process of joining with the ligands, themetal creates new HOMO and LUMO structures that specify the properties and reactivity of the nal complex as well as the conguration of the metal's ve d-orbitals (which may be lled, or partially lled with electrons).93,94\nMany different processes can be used to produce carbon materials, including physical or chemical carbonization from carbon, direct carbonization from organic precursors, the use of zeolites and mesoporous silica as template materials, high temperature solvothermal and hydrothermal processes, electrical arc techniques, and chemical vapor decomposition (CVD) procedures.

However, it cannot be effectively used in water electrolysis due to its low conductivity and inaccessible active sites. Lei Y., et al.97 developed a selfsupporting electrocatalyst by growing a MOF derivative on the surface of iron foam (IF) using a self-template partial transformation approach. The production of several catalysts with various morphologies was also accomplished by varying the Ni concentration and reaction duration. The resulting NiFeLDH@Fe-MOF/IF-2 exhibits excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity in an alkaline electrolyte with the required overpotentials of 183, 237, and 257 mV because of its distinct hierarchical structure, large active area, and abundant active sites, strong combination of highly active amorphous NiFe-LDH and Fe-MOF, high conductivity, and stability of the MOFs array in situ. Using a straightforward ultrasonic process, bimetal\u2013 organic framework nanosheets wrapped around polypyrrole nanotubes (NiCo-MOF@PNTs) were effectively produced. PNTs may effectively prevent the aggregation of NiCo-MOF nanosheets and boost the electronic conductivity of NiCo-MOF in NiCo-MOF@PNTs nanocomposites.

Since most MOFs composites just not only maintain the porous architectures of MOF precursor but also display superior electrical conductivity brought on by the carbon component, they have a greater probability of success as electrode materials. Overall, the development of materials linked to MOFs, such as MOF composites, and electrode materials made from MOFs, has been an intriguing cross-disciplinary area where opportunities and challenges coexist. There are countless opportunities for the discovery of potential electrode materials for various battery systems when electroactive sites are included in the designable MOF components.

Because the insulating Li2O2 particles are enclosed within carefully regulated holes and incorporate Co-based electrocatalysts, the unique structure successfully deposits insulating Li2O2 particles during charging and then expedites their breakdown. Due to its exceptional conductivity and crucial mechanical stability, the carbon framework itself is a superb conductingmatrix. By transforming a porous matrix into a self-standing catalytic structure, specic energy with a high energy density of up to 798 W h kg\u22121 cell can be signicantly increased.105\nThe scheme in Fig. 5 shows the shape size and types of different MOFs dimension-wise. 0D MOF composites which are also discussed later in the review can be synthesized utilizing the one-pot approach, and by following this simple and effective process, it is possible to improve catalytic performances while also lowering the cost of large-scale production.107,108"

Burning non-renewable fossil fuels like coal and oil accounts for the majority of global energy use, dramatically increasing atmospheric CO2 emissions as well as creating other severe environmental issues. Signicant efforts are being undertaken to address the problem of energy scarcity on a global scale. One such attempt is the search for clean, renewable energy sources to replace petroleum-based fuels. Despite their high cost, Pt catalysts are frequently used in electrochemistry. As a result, from an economic and environmental perspective, non-Pt catalysts such MOF composites are gaining popularity. The oxygen evolution process (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction are both electro catalyzed regularly using MOF composites (HER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).124\nHydrogen-based fuel cells, another form of electrolytic cell, also experience ORR at the cathode. The two-electron transfer reaction is an example of a catalytic intermediate that is widely used (HER). The two-step reaction, which needs energy in acidic environments, depends on H. The second stage produces H2 by either mixing two H* or H* with a proton. Thus, the overpotential of the HER is decreased by active electrocatalysts such MOF composites. The electrochemical oxidation of water results in the generation of oxygen, or OER. Two water molecules can be oxidized in acidic or neutral electrolytes to yield four protons and one oxygen molecule.124\nFig. 7 represents synthesis of bifunctional electrocatalysts.

A great lot of interest has also been generated by electrocatalysts in ORR for technologies like metal\u2013air batteries and fuel cells. Additionally, the nano-CuS concentrations affected the ORR's Eonset (onset potential). As the amount of nano-CuS was increased, its porosity shrank, and its electrical conductivity was more than 109 times greater than that of bare Cu-MOF.125 These values were all exceeded by the Eonset values of nano-CuS and bare Cu-BTC. However, when superabundant nano-CuS was introduced to or stacked on top of CuS (56 weight percent) @ Cu-BTC. These results demonstrated a substantial relationship between the materials' porosity and electrical conductivity and the ORR electrocatalytic performance of composite electrocatalysts.126,127\nWhen compared to pure nano-CuS and bare MOF, the electrocatalytic performance of the nano-CuS@Cu-BTC composite dramatically enhanced in terms of starting voltage, the number of electrons transported, and the density of the kinetic current. These outcomes are the result of interactions between nanoCuS, which increases electrical conductivity, and CuBTC, which improves porosity. He and his colleagues also developed Co/MIL-101(Cr), which was used as a bi-functional electrocatalyst by employing an oxidative or reductive method following the impregnation.128 They found that the surface's shiing CoII and CoIII composition signicantly affected the electrocatalyst's OER and ORR activities. However, neither the BET's surface area nor the overall amount of Co on it had any impact on how well it performed. As the catalyst's OER activity increased. More O2 will also be preferentially absorbed as the amount of CoII on the electrocatalyst surface increases, and in a basic electrolyte, electrons will be transferred to oxygen to produce hydro-oxide.129,130"

The ORR's slow reaction kinetics must be overcome, hence more potent air catalysts must be developed.144,145 Additionally, it is believed that developing an appropriate air cathode will enhance the triple-phase boundary and enhance battery performance. The efficiency of MA batteries is being increased by researchers working hard to create efficient air-cathodes and bifunctional electrocatalysts. However, the MA batteries' energy efficiency is still only predicted to reach 65%, which is still cause for concern. MOFs have only ever been utilized in Zn\u2013air batteries\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nas catalysts. The following sections provide numerous examples of this type.146\n5.2.3 Corrosion. Metal\u2013air batteries face challenges with the metal anode, air cathode, and electrolyte while having a high energy density. The most notable of them is dendrite growth, which causes the metal anode to corrode. When excess metal ions build up on the anode surface and are not quickly absorbed, dendrites form. These dendrites have the potential to shorten two electrodes and result in catastrophic failures over time. Fig. 8 shows us the effects of dendrite development, passivation, and corrosion at a metal anode. During experiments in the lab. Li\u2013air batteries offer a high open-circuit voltage and energy density, but corrosion causes them to degrade quickly.147\n5.2.3.1 Passivation layer. An electrode that was passivated could not be discharged further because an insulating coating on its surface prevented the discharge product from migrating. LiOH, ZnO, and Al2O3 served as the corresponding systems' passivation layers in MABs. A non-conductive layer will be generated on the metal surface from soluble species that were produced at the air cathode. This layer, which is nonconductive, raises the cell's internal electrical resistance and inhibits metal breakdown. The most effective way to prevent the production of passivation layers is to employ porous electrodes.149\n5.2.3.2 Dendrite formation and deformation. While the metal electrode cycles in an alkaline electrolyte, the metal anode releases metal ions during discharge and the metal ions redeposit on the anode during charging. The metal electrode will aerwards progressively change form and develop irregular thicknesses on its surface. When the irregular shape builds into dendrites during numerous charge and discharge cycles, the battery system becomes unstable or swi route. To reduce dendritic development and deformation, many methods have been tried. Using non-reaction additives in the zinc electrode or electrolyte, for instance, and covering the zinc metal alloying lithium with sodium, Mg, Al has been demonstrated to successfully suppress the growth Li's dendritic.\nIn conclusion, dendritic structures form in ZABs, LABs, and FABs, passivation layers appear in these materials, and corrosion can occur in any of these materials. Several strategies are needed to resolve these issues.150 Despite having higher ionic radii, sodium has a lower diffusion rate and a greater volume variance, which reduces rate capability and cycling stability. For any battery system, it is essential to nd suitable electrode materials with the necessary electrochemical (redox and catalytic activities), physical (electrical and ionic conductivities), and structural and chemical innovations.\nNickel has the potential to be an OER catalyst, however it is challenging to use in bifunctional catalysts because of its limitations. Due to the conversion of Ni3+ to Ni2+ and the formation of NiO impurities during high temperature heat treatment, which is frequently utilized in the production of catalysts, nickel ions have a tendency to migrate inside crystal structures, catalysts lose some of their capacity to carry out two tasks at once as a result of the limited reversibility of this structural change.

Nickel\u2013iron batteries have a lower energy density and specic power, or, to put it another way, are less efficient. The cells charge up slowly and discharge it gradually (cannot supply sudden large power spikes). This means that in order to attain the output of a \u201cnormal\u201d lead-acid based power system, more batteries and solar panels would be required. As a result of their high hydrogen production, daily gas is necessary to provide the desired performance. Because hydrogen gas is explosive, proper ventilation is crucial. Ni\u2013Fe batteries may endure such treatments without being harmed, although their performance will undoubtedly suffer. Weekly inspections and top-offs are recommended for Ni\u2013Fe batteries. Additionally, the electrolyte solution must occasionally be entirely replenished, which is a nasty and labor-intensive process.151 Last but not the least air electrode's extremely low efficiency is a serious problem for the iron/air and zinc/air batteries and is also susceptible to damage during charge at practical current densities. The stability of the air catalyst in the cathode and the conductivity of the electrolyte continue to pose problems. Researchers from all over the world are delving into these and other problems to realize the full potential of metal\u2013air batteries.152"

One or more of the benets that account for this is the potential of the\n1154 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 1137\u20131161\nelements and structures that support electrocatalytic activities to functionalize with semiconducting substrates like graphene, carbon nanotubes, and MXenes.153 The loaded metal nanoparticles accumulate as the temperature rises during pyrolysis because the carbon catalyst is unable to produce balanced nanostructures. Co3O4 nanosheets were assembled into 2Dmicroassemblies using vacancy engineering methods by Hou et al.154 By altering the annealing temperature, changes were made to the oxygen andmetal ion vacancy contents. It was discovered that the components' synergistic effects improved the Li\u2013O2 battery's electrochemical performance. The annealing temperature raises the amount of oxygen vacancies in Co3O4 from 200 \u00b0C to 400 \u00b0C, with the biggest aws appearing at 300 \u00b0C. By generating the active sites that speed up ORR during the discharge process, these faults also create railroads for O2 to travel across 2D microassembled Co3O4 nanosheets, increasing cycle stability.\nDespite the challenges faced by MOF composites, the following strategies have been devised to overcome them and improve their electrochemical properties: Low molecular weight functional materials and several redox active sites can function to a great extent when the right proportions of organic ligands, metallic ions, and ions are used. By fabricating MOF membranes using certain treatment techniques, such as pressing and phase change, it is possible to overcome their inherent sensitivity and processability restriction without endowing them with primitive characteristics. These restrictions can also be removed by carefully choosing organic ligands and metallic ions.\nCreating enhanced MOF composites by mixing MOF with novel conductive additives is one way to solve this issue.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

A solution to this issue is also indicated by the development of conductive MOF, even though the materials are still in their infancy.70\nField measurement, theoretical computation, and simulation must be used to conduct a thorough investigation into the electrochemical mechanism. Additionally, sophisticated characterization tools are crucial. The reduced rate capacity, high overpotential, and poor cycle stability of today's MOF and COF catalysts are mostly due to low OER activity, whether it be in ZAB systems or Li\u2013air batteries. In order to give MOFs and COFs distinct ORR and OER performance for the advancement of this type of material in the future, a \u201cstructure-oriented\u201d strategy will be developed.155\nSince so many of the tens of thousands of created MOFs and COFs are unstable in organic or aqueous electrolytes, it is challenging to understand the electrochemical process and they cannot be scaled for use in MABs. Therefore, the entire efficiency of electrochemical devices is determined by the stable design of this type of air cathode. Designing water-stable MOF and COFmaterials begins with the production of \u201cwater-in-salt\u201d electrolytes.156 It is frequently possible to use a variety of metal ions, carboxylate linkers containing azoles, and hydrophobic ligands to boost structural stability. Because of their remarkable conductivity, catalysts must be utilized as electrochemical components. Unfortunately, MOFs and COFs cannot be used in electrochemical devices like MABs because of their weak conductivity and conned ability to degrade the discharge products. An efficient strategy for raisingMAB performance is to carefully develop.157 In MOF and COF materials, there is better intrinsic conductivity as well as bifunctional ORR and OER capabilities. Conjugated organic linkers, conductive carbon materials/substrates such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, and foam nickel, as well as the development of p-type doping systems are further techniques to somewhat increase the conductivity of the framework materials.158 Using 3D-printed MOFs to create framework cathodes offers a creative, alternative way to increase the specic energy used in Li\u2013O2 batteries. Metal dust was applied to porous carbon to create an oxygen electrode for LABs. However, throughout the reversible liquid\u2013gas\u2013solid cycles, nanoparticles are susceptible to losing their bond. This problem was addressed by an electrocatalyst constructed from a carbon matrix with stereoscopic Ru nanoparticles dispersed throughout (Ru-MOF). Still aer nding solution there is still risk.159 With current densities of 500 mA g\u22121 and potentials of 0.2/0.7 V, a Ru/carbon electrocatalyst design achieved sustained charge\u2013discharge cycling capability with 800 cycles over 107 days at ambient temperature. It opens up a new opportunity for the oxygen electrode of lithium\u2013oxygen batteries (LOBs).160\nA nickel oxide-based catalyst that was created on graphene oxide by pyrolysis to produce metal oxide nanoparticles was examined and tested for redox reactions by Liu et al.175 When the metal oxide was coupled directly to the graphene oxide,\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nfurther advantages included improved conductivity for the ORR and metal active sites are dispersed uniformly across the graphene sheets. The performance of the OER activity outperformed that of other cobalt and platinum-based catalysts and Ni2+ was found to be the essential component in both the ORR and the OER. The conductivity was enhanced by graphene oxide, but the Ni-oxide catalyst's ORR activity was only marginal. It is necessary to enhance the creation and analysis of creative two-dimensional MOFs. One of the best materials for enabling intercalation may be a two-dimensional MOF. Superior cycle stability and better electrochemical properties can be found in two-dimensional MOFs with appropriately interacting metal clusters and connectors.161 Additionally, by combining two-dimensional MOF with additional two-dimensional functional materials, novel heterogeneous structures with intriguing properties can be created (such MXene).162,163\nAmethod for catalyst regeneration has been developed that separates monovalent metal ions with a selected cation and a thermally regenerating metal\u2013organic framework (MOF). Crosslinked MOF-808 with functionalized poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-acryloylamidobenzo-18-crown-6) (pNCE/ MOF-808) preferentially adsorbs Na+ and K+ while leaving Li+ behind. The size-match effect, ion dehydration effect, and stability constant of the cation-benzo-18-crown-6 complex are responsible for this. It exhibits a high capacity for adsorption of 1.04 mmol g\u22121 and excellent selectivity up to 29.4 for Na+/Li+ and 34.4 for K+/Li+ in the mixed solution including 0.5 M LiCl, 0.5 M NaCl, and 0.5 M KCl. Furthermore, at low temperatures (like 45 \u00b0C) in water, pNCE/MOF-808 with adsorbed Na+ and K+ ions could be effectively regenerated. Additionally, adding functional groups to MOFs enhances their adsorption properties and allows for the selective binding of desired ions. Due to the high binding of the added thiol, Li et al. produced a thiolfunctionalized MIL-68 with Hg2+ selectivity. The addition of functional groups to MOFs also improves their adsorption abilities and permits the selective binding of selected ions. However, the bulk of ion adsorbent regeneration reported up to this point has required concentrated salt solution, acid/base, or, which invariably results in secondary pollution, making it essential to identify a environmentally friendly regeneration method.164"

Due to their ease of use, components that respond to light and temperature are frequently utilized.165,166\nThe fabrication of a conductive MOF and its electrochemical characteristics are enhanced by the use of suitable organic connections for SCs. In conclusion, by using functional components to further improve the electrochemical behavior of virgin MOF, MOF composites have a signicant impact on the eld of EES. Research on MOF composites has recently evolved swily, despite certain persistent difficulties, and the development of innovative functional materials. The research presented in this review provides a solid platform for future study and is crucial for comprehending how MOF composites are being employed as potential energy storage materials.167,168 The electrochemical reaction for air cathodes consists of numerous electron transfer processes and the formation of a few transitional products. The development of MOF and COF catalysts in general may become more complicated because the actual catalytic centre and catalysis may be obscured and the disparity between catalytic activity and catalyst specications may grow. These methods may enable the precise computational synthesis of MOF and COF catalysts.169\nA number of developments have been made and were investigated here for the MOF and COF materials use as fundamental applications in MABs, especially as a cathode catalyst.153,170 According to past study, the development of new MABs devices that fully leverage the structural and compositional properties of MOF and COF materials would improve the market prospects for future energy. For instance, recent developments in catalysts for N2 electroreduction processes have made it possible to develop a unique class of Zn\u2013N2 aqueous batteries.171,172 Though there is currently little knowledge about it, nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) of MOFmaterials is highly anticipated in future. If MABs are selected as the intended applications, in order to indicate catalyst's useful performance, considerable battery research is also required. On the basis of similar working theories, it can be said that MOF materials could be potential candidates for usage in more MABs, such as sodium\u2013air batteries, aluminum\u2013air batteries, magnesium\u2013air batteries, supercapacitors etc. The COF and MOF derivatives created for ZAB systems and Li\u2013air batteries, however, have been included into the batteries on several occasions, particularly as cathode catalysts. Using pure MOFs and COFs directly in MABs, on the other hand, has received much less attention.173,174\nConflicts of interest\nThe authors declare no known competing conict of interests."
