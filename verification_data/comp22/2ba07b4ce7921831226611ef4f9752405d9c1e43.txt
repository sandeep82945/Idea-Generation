"The human gait is forthcoming behavioral excellence, and many related learning methods have proved that it has exceptional potential for biometric identification and recognition using IoT and fog computing. This research study demonstrated a simple yet efficient fog-based technique (FCML-Gait) for personal identification and gender recognition from gait sequences. We have used SURF, SRML, and SVM at the fog layer to achieve better recognition accuracy in the real-time instance. We have extracted the feature vectors using the SURF feature descriptor, and for verification of the system, an SRML and SVM-based classifier has been used at the fog layer. The accuracy of the proposed FCMLGait-based recognition system outperforms the previous SRML and other techniques as well. The average accuracy values of different samples (for the training set having n 75%, n 50%, and n 25%) are obtained as 95.49%, 93.07%, and 92.82%, respectively, which are higher than previous (SRML) also an alert is generated for an unauthorized human. Further, in terms of recognition time which is another crucial performance metric in recognition systems, the proposed FCML-based recognition system can achieve an average recognition time of 0.0834 s, which is very less than other existing methods available in the literature. In the cloud, records are kept for future use like decision making, prediction of gender ratio, and alert generation. Despite the benefits of the proposed system, it has some limitations as the dataset used is collected indoor, collection and use of outdoor data via IoT devices is needed. It is not implemented in real-world scenarios as having diversity in the datasets and security threats as well which are not taken into consideration. Qualitative features are not considered and have scope to improve the performance further via the concept of fused feature vectors with other advanced classifiers."
