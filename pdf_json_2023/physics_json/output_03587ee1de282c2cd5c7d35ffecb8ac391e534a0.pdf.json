Since HA possesses excellent biocompatible properties,2,3 it plays an important role in research and has been applied in biomaterials, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals.4\u20137 In particular, pure or modied HA has been widely studied as a supporting material to construct various drug delivery systems involving nanoparticles, liposomes, and microneedle patches to improve drug penetration and stability.8\u201310\nIn recent years, HA-coated gold nanoparticles (AuNP-HA) have attracted increasing interest for drug delivery and controlled release because of their large surface area,\nter (BMTC), Korea Institute of Industrial ngsangbuk-do 38822, Republic of Korea.\neering, Dongguk University-Seoul, Seoul\ntion (ESI) available.

In the case of the HA-based nanoparticles, HA is known to prevent opsonisation by acting as a non-adhesive polymer for most blood proteins and play a role in extending the circulation time of nanoparticles.16,17 Kumar et al. prepared AuNP-HA for metformin delivery, wherein AuNPs were synthesized by using an eggplant extract as a reducing agent and HA was utilized as a capping and targeting agent.18 Low molecular weight HA (5 kDa) was employed as surface functionalizing material of AuNPs to improve penetration ability of AuNP through the eye barriers and enhances stability of AuNPs in different media and pHs.19 In addition, smallinterfering RNA delivery system by utilizing AuNP-HA was reported for lung cancer treatment.20\nThe AuNP-HA is a promising biocompatible nanomaterial; however, the general synthesis of a AuNP-HA-based drug delivery system requires several chemical reaction steps. The process is unsuitable for scaled-up production as it is timeconsuming and causes material loss. To overcome these limitations, one-pot synthesis involving various chemical transformations without purifying the intermediate compounds is\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 5529\u20135537 | 5529\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

To the best of our knowledge, no study has been conducted to investigate inuence of molecular weight of HA for AuNP-HA-based drug delivery system.\nIn this study, we synthesized AuNP-HA incorporated with a poorly water-soluble drug, sulfasalazine (SSZ), to enhance its bioavailability with controlled release by using the one-pot synthesis strategy. The SSZ is a well-known drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. The solubility of SSZ in water is 0.57 mg mL\u22121 since the SSZ is a conjugate of 5-aminosalicylic acid and sulfapyridine, which indicates poorly water-soluble drug.23,24 Recently, several studies have been reported to deliver SSZ with micro or nanoparticles.25\u201327 However, they have drawbacks in initial release rate,25 long term release,26 or low encapsulation efficiency27 and they possess complex synthesis method. To overcome these limitations, we newly suggested the one-pot synthesis of AuNP-HA-SSZ as a controlled drug delivery system illustrated in Scheme 1. For the one-pot synthesis, all components, including gold ions(III), HA, and SSZ were mixed in deionized water (DW), and a reducing agent was applied to the mixture. In addition, to investigate the effects of molecular weight and size of HA on the one-pot synthesis of AuNP-HA and the controlled drug delivery system, HAs with different molecular weights were prepared by electron beam (e-beam) irradiation. E-beam irradiation is one of the HA degradation strategies that does not involve chemical property changes.28,29 We characterized the e-beam-irradiated HAs and AuNP-HA incorporated with SSZ through physicochemical and image analysis. The drug encapsulation efficiency (DEE) and drug loading capacity (DLC) of the AuNP-HA-SSZ were determined by quantifying the absorption of the supernatant using a UV-vis spectrometer. Finally, in vitro drug release patterns of the AuNP-HA-SSZs were investigated in various conditions including simulated body\nScheme 1 Schematic illustration for one-pot synthesis of the gold nanoparticle-hyaluronic acid-sulfasalazine (AuNP-HA-SSZ).\n5530 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 5529\u20135537\nuids with kinetic modelling of controlled drug release patterns."

In case of the e-beamirradiated HAs, the results show that the retention time increases as the e-beam irradiation dose of the sample increases. Since the retention time is faster as the size of the sample increases, low-energy-irradiated HA has a smaller polymeric size than the high-energy-irradiated HA. In case of pristine HA, GPC analysis was conducted by using a column different from that of e-beam irradiation HAs; therefore, the exact mass analysis should be required for accurate comparison of the HAs. The exact masses of the HAs were calculated using the GPC coupled with MALS system. As shown in Fig. 1b, the molecular weight decreased from 1360 kDa (pristine) to 4 kDa (50 kGy) with the increase in radiation dose due to HA degradation.

The AuNP-SSZ particle synthesized without HA showed severe aggregation of lots of small particles (Fig. 2a(i)) since any stabilizing agents, generally surfactant, were not applied during the reaction. On the other hand, spherical shape and smooth surface were found for all AuNPHA-SSZ particles (Fig. 2a(ii)\u2013(v)), which means the HA plays a vital role in stabilizing nanoparticles and preventing aggregation. According to the statistical analyses (Fig. 2b), the average particle diameters of the AuNP-HA(0, 2, 20, and 50 kGy)SSZ were determined as 24.42, 18.01, 14.53, and 12.70 nm, respectively. In addition, skewness and kurtosis values were evaluated to analyse the size distribution of the synthesized particles (Table S2\u2020). The smaller particles in case of the AuNPHA(20 and 50 kGy)-SSZ had a narrower distribution than the larger ones, indicating that the particles are uniform in size and shape. In Fig S3,\u2020 hydrodynamic diameters of the AuNP-SSZ and the AuNP-HA-SSZs were determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS), which decreased by using lowmolecular weight HA as the same with TEM image analysis.\nThe PDI values of the AuNP-SSZ and the AuNP-HA-SSZ are displayed in Fig. 3a. AuNP-SSZ showed a high polydispersity with a PDI value of 1.5, and AuNP-HA(0)-SSZ had a slightly lower PDI value than AuNP-SSZ. In contrast, the PDI values of AuNPHA(2, 20, and 50 kGy)-SSZ signicantly decreased, indicating that the particles prepared with low molecular weight HA were monodisperse. Fig. 3b shows that the zeta potential of AuNPHA-SSZ was highly negative with a narrow distribution at pH 7.0, conrming that HAs were fully coated on the AuNP surface. It is known that the surface charge plays a very important role in the interaction between nanoparticles and biological substances. The negative surface of AuNP-HA-SSZ would enhance the stability of nanoparticles in systematic circulation.40 Fig. 3c shows the UV-vis spectra of the nanoparticles. AuNP-HA(50 kGy)-SSZ exhibited a characteristic absorption band at about 540 nm, with a narrow half-peak width. Comparatively, AuNP-HA-SSZ synthesized with higher molecular weight HA showed red-shied absorption. When AuNP-SSZ was synthesized without HA, the absorption band was broad and weak, indicating that particle aggregation. As a result, low molecular weight HA is favourable for generating more\nFig. 3 (a) PDI value and (b) surface charge of AuNP by zeta-potential Student's t-test).

            "text": "The DEE and DLC of the AuNP-HA-SSZ were investigated by measuring the weights of the input amount of SSZ, free SSZ in supernatants, and nally synthesized nanoparticles. The DEE indicates the amount of drugs incorporated into the synthesized nanoparticles compared with the initial input amount of drugs, and the DLC indicates the mass ratio of drugs to the synthesized nanoparticles.30 As shown in Fig. 4a, a relatively high DEE value was obtained in the absence of HA, indicating SSZ was adsorbed on the surface of AuNPs due to the increased affinity or interactions between the hydrophobic moieties on SSZ and AuNPs.41 For the HA-coated AuNPs, more than half of the SSZ was successfully incorporated into the particles. Interestingly, the DEE increased signicantly when the molecular weight of HA decreased and reached 96% when 4 kDa HA was used. In the case of low molecular weight HA, since lots of covalent bonds constituting the polymer are decomposed compared to high molecular weight HA, contribution of intermolecular interactions increases over that of covalent bonds when synthesizing the HA layer of the AuNP-HA. Accordingly, SSZ might be more easily incorporated into the HA layer composed of low molecular weight HA, resulting that the DEE increased. On the other hand, DLC values were approximately\nanalysis (*indicates p-value <0.05 and ** indicates p-value <0.01 by SSZ.\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 5529\u20135537 | 5533\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

In vitro drug release study\nThe time-dependent release proles of SSZ in DW and PBS (pH 7.4) are displayed in Fig. 5a and b, respectively. All AuNP-HA-SSZ particles released inconsiderable amounts of SSZ (\u223c7%) in DW within 60 min, and there was no additional release aer 60 min. Compared to the dissolution rate of free SSZ in DW, about 47%, the low SSZ release data suggested that SSZ were strongly attached to the AuNP-HA-SSZ particles. In the PBS condition, the SSZ was much more released from AuNP-HA-SSZ particles, over 70% within 5 h, comparable with that of DW condition. To predict the drug release behaviour in the human body, AuNPHA-SSZ was treated with the simulated gastric uid and simulated intestinal uid (Fig. 5c and d) with long-term release of the SSZ (Fig. S5\u2020). The SSZ is an oral administration drug which passes through the stomach in acidic condition and is absorbed in the neutral-weakly basic intestinal condition. The maximum drug release (\u223c95%) occurred in simulated intestinal uid attributed to its high pH. As the pH increased, the HA matrix began to swell due to the dissolution of carboxylate groups\nFig. 5 Time-dependent release patterns of the SSZ from the AuNPSSZ and the AuNP-HA-SSZ in (a) DW, (b) PBS, (c) simulated gastric solution, and (d) simulated intestinal solution.\n(COO\u2212), facilitating the release of SSZ from the AuNP-HA. In addition, the HA polymeric layer shielded the encapsulated drug molecules, resulting in sustained release, reducing drug leakage and initial rapid release. Oral absorption of SSZ is affected by the physiological microenvironment. Each part of the digestive system increases from the stomach to the intestine and has a different pH value.42,43 Drugs may experience several pH-dependent reactions, such as oxidation, hydrolysis, or deamination, which decreased viability.44 HA generally interferes with drug release under acidic conditions in the stomach and small intestine, and promotes drug release in the high pH environment of the colon, preventing systemic adverse effects and improving therapeutic efficacy.45"

            "text": "The drug release behaviours of the SSZ from the AuNP-HA-SSZ in PBS and intestinal condition were tted using various empirical equations based on the nature of the polymer. Kinetic analysis was not conducted for the DW and the simulated gastric solution, since the release patterns were not appropriate for tting. The empirical equations used for tting include rst order, Elovich, parabolic diffusion, and Korsmeyer\u2013Peppas model, and their regression coefficients (R2) were calculated (Table 1). The kinetic models imply that the rst order model describes the release behaviour mainly by dissolution;46 the Elovich model explains a release process through bulk surface diffusion;35,46 parabolic diffusion model is based on ionexchange phenomena;36,46 and the Korsmeyer\u2013Peppas model assumes that the release occurs through diffusion from at surfaces.37,46 The results show that the Korsmeyer\u2013Peppas equation is considered an appropriate model to describe the SSZ release of the AuNP-HA-SSZ, while in case of the AuNP-SSZ, Elovich model was followed. Therefore, in case of the AuNP-SSZ, the SSZ is released through bulk surface diffusion. On the other hands, in case of AuNP-HA-SSZ, SSZ is released from at surfaces which implies the SSZ is well incorporated into the particle surfaces. In addition, the experimental release kinetics showed that the drug release did not reach equilibrium in the given time interval. The hydration process was in progress, and the swelling degree did not reach a plateau.46,47\nThe Korsmeyer\u2013Peppas model parameters obtained by tting are listed in Table 2. The Ksp and n values depend on the amounts of loaded drug and the molecular weight of the HA.\nuNP-HA for kinetic model fitting\nTable 2 Drug release kinetics parameters of AuNP-HA-SSZ in PBS and simulated intestinal solution\nCondition Sample Ksp n\nPBS AuNP-HA(0)-SSZ 2.924 0.379 AuNP-HA(2 kGy)-SSZ 2.789 0.457 AuNP-HA(20 kGy)-SSZ 2.817 0.440 AuNP-HA(50 kGy)-SSZ 2.818 0.439 Intestinal condition\nAuNP-HA(0)-SSZ 3.329 0.514 AuNP-HA(2 kGy)-SSZ 2.821 0.489 AuNP-HA(20 kGy)-SSZ 3.129 0.506 AuNP-HA(50 kGy)-SSZ 3.408 0.513\nFig. 6 Cytotoxicity test of the AuNP-HA-SSZ with control samples.\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

A lower Ksp indicates a lower drug release rate and a mild interaction between the drug and the carrier.48 For the PBS condition, there was no signicant differences among each samples, while under intestinal conditions, AuNP-HA(50 kGy)-SSZ had a signicantly higher Ksp value than that of AuNP-HA(2 kGy)SSZ, suggesting that low molecular weight HA accelerates drug release. The drug release also depends on the diffusion and swelling of the polymer, which represents n value in the Korsmeyer\u2013Peppas model. When n < 0.43, the drug release depend on the Fickian diffusion mechanism. The values of 0.43 < n < 0.85 is considered as non-Fickian drug diffusion mechanism.49,50 As shown in Table 2, n values were 0.43 to 0.85 (except for AuNP-HA(0)-SSZ in PBS), indicating an anomalous mechanism (non-Fickian) for drug release. It implies that drug diffusion and HA chain relaxation occurred simultaneously to release SSZ. HA swelling facilitates drug dissolution by enhancing the water permeability. Subsequently, the SSZ diffuses from the carrier owing to the chemical potential gradient."

For the assay, non-treated condition was employed as an assay control, AuNPHA(20 kGy) and free SSZ was used as control samples. The AuNP-HA-SSZs and the control samples were applied to each well with concentrations from 0.1 mg mL\u22121 to 400 mg mL\u22121 for 24 h. Fig. 6 shows the cell viability results of the AuNP-HA-SSZs with the controls. It can be found that the cell viability of the AuNP-HA(20 kGy) is higher than 90% compared to the assay control even at the highest concentration (400 mg mL\u22121). In addition, e-beam-irradiated HAs also showed high cell viability (Fig. S6\u2020), demonstrating that the HA and AuNP are biocompatible materials without cytotoxicity. In case of the free SSZ, cytotoxicity to the C2C12 cell was observed by applying over 100 mg mL\u22121 concentration of SSZ. Following the control result, the AuNP-SSZ and AuNP-HA-SSZ also showed cytotoxicity to the C2C12 cell by applying over 100 mg mL\u22121 concentration. Interestingly, as the molecular weight of HA decreased, the cell viability of synthesized nanoparticles decreased at 100 mg mL\u22121 concentration.

In the case of the AuNP-HA-SSZ using HA with a small molecular weight, it can be understood that the drug release efficiency is high, and thus the cytotoxicity is also high. Therefore, it is conrmed that the AuNP-HA can be used for potential application of drug delivery system with controlled release of drugs."

            "text": "This study reported the one-pot synthesis of the drug-loaded AuNPs assisted by the e-beam irradiated HA. The HA possessing negative charge plays an essential role in well-dispersed nanoparticle synthesis and drug encapsulation. The e-beam irradiation makes low molecular weight HAs without any change of chemical characteristics, and it helps to control nanoparticle morphology and drug encapsulation. The applicability of the AuNP-HA carriers for drug delivery was demonstrated by successful loading of SSZ, poorly water-soluble drug with high levels of the DEE and the DLC. The prepared AuNPHA-SSZ exhibited a slower release of SSZ over a short time and excellent sensitivity to different pHs and physiological conditions. The drug release was negligible in DW and gastric condition; in contrast, the release rate was the highest in simulated intestinal conditions. The drug release behaviour of the SSZ was tted using various empirical equations. The results show that the Korsmeyer\u2013Peppas equation is considered an appropriate model to describe SSZ release of the AuNP-HASSZ, which indicates the SSZ is released by bulk surface diffusion. In addition, the biocompatibility and efficacy of the AuNPHA-SSZ was investigated by cytotoxicity test. Therefore, the AuNP-HA demonstrates its potential as an advanced drug delivery carrier with controlled release characteristics.\nAuthor contributions\nHyoung-Mi Kim: conceptualization, methodology, formal analysis, validation, investigation, data curation, writing \u2013 original dra; Jae Hong Park: formal analysis, methodology, investigation; You Jin Choi: formal analysis, methodology, investigation; Jae-Min Oh: methodology, investigation, resources, writing \u2013 review & editing; Junghun Park: conceptualization, methodology, investigation, resources, writing \u2013 review & editing, supervision, funding acquisition.\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 5529\u20135537 | 5535\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .
