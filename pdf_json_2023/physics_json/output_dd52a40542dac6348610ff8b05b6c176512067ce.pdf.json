    "abstractText": "Lawsonia inermis, known as henna, has traditionally been utilized in cosmetics and folk medicine because of their valuable health effects. A lack of information about the processes that increase or decrease release, as well as the biological activities of constituents of natural origin, is an important pharmacological problem. This investigation evaluates the influence of moist heat on the flavonoid and phenolic contents of henna powder and their biological activities. HPLC analysis reflected the existence of 20 and 19 compounds of flavonoids and phenolics in the extract of unpretreated henna by moist heat (UPMH) and pre-treated henna by moist heat (PMH). Several compounds such as chlorogenic acid, ellagic acid, rutin, rosmarinic acid, kaempferol, and pyrocatechol occurred with high concentrations of 57,017.33, 25,821.09, 15,059.88, 6345.08, 1248.42, and 819.19 \u03bcg/mL UPMH while occurred with low concentrations of 44,286.51, 17,914.26, 3809.85, 5760.05, 49.01, and 0.0 \u03bcg/mL, respectively in PMH. C. albicans, C. tropicalis, and G. candidum were more affected by UPMH with inhibition zones of 30.17 \u00b1 0.29, 27 \u00b1 0.5, and 29 \u00b1 1.5 mm than PMH with inhibition zones of 29 \u00b1 0.5, 25.33 \u00b1 0.58, and 24.17 \u00b1 0.29 mm, respectively. UPMH henna exhibited less MIC and MFC against the tested yeasts than PMH. Moreover, UPMH henna showed good wound healing, where the rat of migration, wound closure %, and area difference % were 14.806 um, 74.938 um2, and 710.667% compared with PMH henna 11.360 um, 59.083 um2, 545.333%, respectively. Antioxidant activity of UPMH and PMH henna. Promising antioxidant activity was recorded for both UPMH or PMH henna with IC50 5.46 \u03bcg/mL and 7.46 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. The docking interaction of chlorogenic acid and ellagic acid with the crystal structures of G. candidum (4ZZT) and C. albicans (4YDE) was examined. The biological screening demonstrated that the compounds had favorable docking results with particular proteins. Chlorogenic acid had robust behavior in the G. candidum (4ZZT) active pocket and displayed a docking score of \u22127.84379 Kcal/mol, higher than ellagic acid\u2019s \u22126.18615 Kcal/mol.",

            "text": "Lawsonia inermis (Lythraceae family) is commonly recognized as henna and is native to subtropical areas of North Africa and Asia. Traditionally, it has been utilized as a dandrufffighting and a controller for fungi when functional to the hair, feet, and hands, besides coloring of skin, hair, and nails was attributed to henna [1,2]. Several pharmacological properties were associated with henna extract, such as alleviating and ameliorating wound\nLife 2023, 13, 1839. https://doi.org/10.3390/life13091839 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/life\nLife 2023, 13, 1839 2 of 19\nhealing, antifungal, antibacterial, antioxidant, nootropic, hepatoprotective, anti-ulcer, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer activity. However, the leaves of this plant represent the most valuable part, but roots, stem, and bark have been utilized in ethno medicine conventional medicine for over nine centuries [3,4]. Species of Candida are pathogenic yeast forming mucocutaneous and systemic complaints in humans, particularly in diabetes patients, transplant recipients, xerostomia, malignancy, malnutrition, and lowly oral hygiene (immunocompromised patients) [5,6]. Several species of Candida become resistant to antifungal compounds [7]. Therefore, there is a requisite for novel compounds to fight pathogenic yeasts with greater efficiency and low toxicity. Yig\u0306it [3] tested the paste of L. inermis extract against several clinical Candida isolates including Candida albicans, C. parapsilosis, C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, C. krusei, C. kefyr with different levels of inhibition, where the inhibition zone was more than 20 mm against 35.4% of the isolates, and was up to 15 mm against 38.0%, while the rest of isolates were resistance to the extract of L. inermis. As reported by Samadi et al. [8], henna extract can be applied to treat oral cavity infections resulting from C. albicans because of the promising anti-candidal activity of the extract, with 2.8 mg/ mL as the minimum inhibitory concentration. Besides Candida spp., the henna leaves extract reflected a fungicidal effect against filamentous fungi, including Penicillium ochrochloron, P. funiculosum, Aspergillus flavus, A. ochraceus due to the presence of apigenin 5-glucoside in the extract [9]. Trichophyton spp. Curvularia spp. and Geotrichum spp. were affected by henna leaf extract because of the existence of terpenes, aliphatic compounds, and flavonoids [10]. Different extraction solvents (chloroform, ethanol, and methanol) and methods (hot sequential extraction) were applied to evaluate the biological activities of L. inermis [11]. Despite the use of natural materials since the beginning of humanity, and even the demand for them is increasing daily, there is a big gap between how to apply, the correct extraction methods, and pre-treatments to evaluate its effects on the type and quantity of active ingredients. In the present investigation, moist heat was applied to the powder of henna before the extraction process and its biological activities. Some plants, such as Laurus nobilis, were subjected to microwave, and high temperature of oven up to 120 \u25e6C [12]. Also, Al-Rajhi et al. [13] studied the effect of moist heat on the phenolic and flavonoid contents of L. nobilis, where moist heat induced the release of constituents and increased its biological activities. To date, numerous studies have reported the biological activities of henna using several extraction solvents, but few, if any, investigations have assessed the phytochemical characterization and biological effect of pre-treated henna by moist heat. Therefore, the current investigation aimed to study the effect of moist heat on henna before extraction, anti-yeast and antioxidant activity, and healing properties. Also, the molecular docking interaction of the most detected constituents of henna extract with some tested yeasts."

            "text": "The effect of moist heat was evaluated on the contents of flavonoid and phenolic in Henna extract, as well as its anti-yeast properties and other biological activities were performed (Figure 1). From HPLC analysis, the extract of unpre-treated henna by moist heat (UPMH) reflected the existence of 20 compounds, while the extract of pre-treated henna by moist heat (PMH) reflected the existence of 19 compounds of flavonoids and phenolics with different retention times, area, area %, and concentrations (Figures 2 and 3 and Table 1). Chlorogenic acid, ellagic acid, gallic acid, rosmarinic acid, and rutin represent the highest concentrations in both UPMH and PMH henna extracts. The results indicated that the concentrations of the most detected compounds decreased in PMH henna extract compared to UPMH. For example, the concentrations of chlorogenic acid, ellagic acid, rutin, rosmarinic acid, kaempferol, and pyrocatechol were 57,017.33, 25,821.09, 15,059.88, 6345.08, 1248.42, and 819.19 \u00b5g/mL in UPMH, while become 44,286.51, 17,914.26, 3809.85, 5760.05, 49.01, and 0.0 \u00b5g/mL in PMH henna extract On the other hand, quercetin, naringenin, gallic acid, and coumaric acid concentrations were 96.76, 133.45, 9349.90, and 270.56 \u00b5g/mL in UPMH while becoming 1269.47, 2146.89, 32,349.91, and 402.02 \u00b5g/mL in PMH henna extract, respectively. Some studies reported that the effect of moist heat induced the discharge of extract constituents, unlike the current study. For example, Ju\u00e1niz et al. [17] found that phenolic constituents of vegetables liberated more if they were pretreated with heat due to cell wall destruction by heat. The decrease of most compounds in pre-treated henna extract or missing compound (pyrocatechol) indicated that these compounds are unstable at high temperatures or heat-sensitive and, at the same time, may easily oxidize and transform into other compounds. This explanation may match with Khoddami et al. [14]. While the concentration of some compounds increased, it may be due to high temperature causing the destruction of plant cell walls, causing the release of internal compounds. Another clarification of this phenomenon is that some phenolic and flavonoid constituents exist in an insoluble form. Heat may break these constituents, leading to the discharge of these bound constituents.\nLife 2023, 13, 1839 6 of 19\nLife 2023, 13, 1839 6 of 19 clarification of this phenomenon is that some phenolic and flavonoid constituents exist in an insoluble form. Heat may break these constituents, leading to the discharge of these bound constituents.\nPreviously, Routray and Orsat [18] revealed that some phenolic ingredients were degraded when the natural plant extracts were exposed to the high power of the microwave. Dezashibi et al. [19] found that ultrasound of henna extract increments the phenolic constituents. Moreover, the content of total phenolic was affected by storage temperature and period.

            "text": "In the current decade, molecular docking has attracted the attention of several investigators in drug design, development, and discovery. Structure-based computer modeling of ligand-receptor interactions is widely used in modern drug development. To identify conformational changes that vary with the environment and to characterize the interaction of the molecule with the protein with which it interacts inside the body, molecular docking calculations are commonly used in structure-based drug design investigations. Chlorogenic and ellagic acids were docked using MOE (Molecular Operating Environment) in a vital trial to get insight into the potential pathways through which these compounds exert their antibacterial action. Both target proteins interact effectively with inhibitor compounds. The docking results of compounds\u2019 interaction with the crystal structures of G. candidum (4ZZT) and C. albicans (4YDE) (4YDE code of the farnesyltransferase enzyme, and 4ZZT code of the enzyme cellobiohydrolase enzyme, which represent one\nLife 2023, 13, 1839 12 of 19\nof the virulence factors in yeast cells) revealed that chlorogenic acid was found the most promising than ellagic acid. Chlorogenic acid revealed substantial binding interactions within the (4ZZT) active site with a binding score of \u22127.84379 Kcal mol\u22121 according to five conventional hydrogen bonds between GLU 217 and O 19 with 2.80 \u00c5, GLN 175 and O 17 with 2.97 \u00c5, HIS 228 and O 19 with 3.24 \u00c5, TRP 380 and C 1 with 3.19 \u00c5, and TRP 371 and 6-ring with 3.61 \u00c5. Also, ellagic acid outlined four significant interactions with active site residues of G. candidum (4ZZT) between GLU 217 and O 20 with 2.67 \u00c5, THR 226 and O 22 with 3.20 \u00c5, ARG 399 and O 24 with 3.08 \u00c5, and ARG 251 and 6-ring with 4.09 \u00c5. Similarly, ranked the inhibitor compounds with C. albicans (4YDE) showed similar behavior and adopted direct H-donor and H-acceptor bonds with active site residues. Chlorogenic acid highlighted a binding score of \u22125.69876 Kcal mol\u22121, and exhibited several key interactions with (4YDE) with ASP 527, ASP 569, and LYS 512 via C 26, O 40, and O 23, respectively. While ellagic acid had a binding score of \u22124.5145 Kcal mol\u22121, and only one donor interaction between the O 20 atom and the ASP 527 amino acid residue, it demonstrated reduced effectiveness to (4YDE).

Moreover, the anti-yeast, antioxidant, and healing properties of un-pretreated henna were acceptable compared to pretreated henna by moist heat. In the search for new bioactive analogues, chlorogenic acid and ellagic acid exhibited good potential for G. candidum and C. albicans inhibition.
