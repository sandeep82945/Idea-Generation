    "abstractText": "Background Left ventricular (LV) circumferential and longitudinal strain provide important insight into LV mechanics and function, each contributing to volumetric changes throughout the cardiac cycle. We sought to explore this strainvolume relationship in more detail, by mathematically integrating circumferential and longitudinal strain and strain rate to predict LV volume and volumetric rates of change. Methods Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging from 229 participants from the Alberta HEART Study (46 healthy controls, 77 individuals at risk for developing heart failure [HF], 70 patients with diagnosed HF with preserved ejection fraction [HFpEF], and 36 patients with diagnosed HF with reduced ejection fraction [HFrEF]) were evaluated. LV volume was assessed by the method of disks and strain/strain rate were assessed by CMR feature tracking. Results Integrating endocardial circumferential and longitudinal strain provided a close approximation of LV ejection fraction (EFStrain), when compared to gold-standard volumetric assessment (EFVolume: r = 0.94, P < 0.0001). Likewise, integrating circumferential and longitudinal strain rate provided a close approximation of peak ejection and peak filling rates (PERStrain and PFRStrain, respectively) compared to their gold-standard volume-time equivalents (PERVolume, r = 0.73, P < 0.0001 and PFRVolume, r = 0.78, P < 0.0001, respectively). Moreover, each integrated strain measure differentiated patients across the HF continuum (all P < 0.01), with the HFrEF group having worse EFStrain, PERStrain, and PFRStrain compared to all other groups, and HFpEF having less favorable EFStrain and PFRStrain compared to both at-risk and control groups. Conclusions The data herein establish the theoretical framework for integrating discrete strain components into volumetric measurements across the cardiac cycle, and highlight the potential benefit of this approach for differentiating patients along the heart failure continuum.",

The Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication waiver (http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) applies to the data made available in this article, unless otherwise stated in a credit line to the data.\nMethods Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging from 229 participants from the Alberta HEART Study (46 healthy controls, 77 individuals at risk for developing heart failure [HF], 70 patients with diagnosed HF with preserved ejection fraction [HFpEF], and 36 patients with diagnosed HF with reduced ejection fraction [HFrEF]) were evaluated. LV volume was assessed by the method of disks and strain/strain rate were assessed by CMR feature tracking.\nResults Integrating endocardial circumferential and longitudinal strain provided a close approximation of LV ejection fraction (EFStrain), when compared to gold-standard volumetric assessment (EFVolume: r = 0.94, P < 0.0001). Likewise, integrating circumferential and longitudinal strain rate provided a close approximation of peak ejection and peak filling rates (PERStrain and PFRStrain, respectively) compared to their gold-standard volume-time equivalents (PERVolume, r = 0.73, P < 0.0001 and PFRVolume, r = 0.78, P < 0.0001, respectively). Moreover, each integrated strain measure differentiated patients across the HF continuum (all P < 0.01), with the HFrEF group having worse EFStrain, PERStrain, and PFRStrain compared to all other groups, and HFpEF having less favorable EFStrain and PFRStrain compared to both at-risk and control groups.\nConclusions The data herein establish the theoretical framework for integrating discrete strain components into volumetric measurements across the cardiac cycle, and highlight the potential benefit of this approach for differentiating patients along the heart failure continuum.\nKeywords Strain, Volume-time, Ejection fraction, Filling rate, Ejection rate\n*Correspondence: Michael D.

            "text": "The importance of evaluating left ventricular (LV) strain in clinical imaging studies of patients across the heart failure (HF) continuum is well established [1\u20133], with strain often outperforming volumetric measures, such as ejection fraction, for risk prediction [4\u20136]. However, the integrated effects of strain ultimately determine volumetric function and thus it is important to understand the relationship between the distinct strain components and volume changes. Due to the unique muscle fiber orientation of the LV, tissue deformation occurs in well characterized complex patterns [7\u20139] which results in the shortening and lengthening of the myocardial borders in the circumferential and longitudinal direction (i.e. circumferential and longitudinal strain) [9\u201312]. Circumferential and longitudinal strains on the endocardial surface, in particular, determine the changes in LV volume across the cardiac cycle [13\u201316]. Indeed, changes in volume of a prolate ellipsoid (the shape of LV) are linearly related to changes in chamber length and quadratically related to changes in chamber circumference [15\u201317]. This strainvolume relationship helps to explain how ejection fraction can be maintained despite abnormalities in systolic strain for one component [15, 18], and informs the relative contributions of each strain component to volumetric function.\nDespite a general appreciation for this strain-volume relationship, this concept has yet to translate to clinical populations or to relate systolic and diastolic strain rates to volumetric patterns of ejection and filling, respectively. As such, we leveraged a database of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging from individuals along the HF continuum enrolled from the University of Alberta site of the Alberta Heart Study [19] to test the hypothesis that measures of systolic and diastolic function (LV ejection fraction, peak filling rate and peak ejection rate) derived from circumferential and longitudinal strain (a) correlate to gold-standard volume-time relationships, and (b) differentiate patients along the heart failure continuum."

The LV basal and apical boundaries were identified using the long-axis views to further define the extent of the LV chamber. Papillary muscles and trabeculae were included as part of the ventricular lumen. LV volumes were calculated by the summation of the volumes for each short-axis slice. PERVolume and PFRVolume were defined as the maximal LV volumetric change between sequential temporal phases, normalized to the LV end-diastolic volume [20]."

This approximate volume is used here only to represent the linear and quadratic contributions of length and circumference to volume, respectively. Based on Eq.\u00a0 1, LV EF can be calculated by,\nwhere EDV and ESV are the LV end-diastolic and endsystolic volume, respectively.

Similar to Eq.\u00a07 above, Eq.\u00a011 links the commonly measured fractional changes in linear dimensions of the heart (length and circumference) and their rates of change (i.e. strain rates) to the corresponding rates of volume change. Importantly, dEF(t)/dt in Eq.\u00a011, like the strains and strain rates it is derived from, is a normalized measure of volumetric function that is independent of the heart volume, with units of (s\u22121), similar to strain rates. PERStrain was determined as the peak rate of blood ejection during systole and PFRStrain was determined as the peak rate of volumetric filling in early diastole, equivalent to the s\u2019 and e\u2019 on the integrated strain curve, respectively."

            "text": "Circumferential and longitudinal deformation of the LV occurs simultaneously in systole and diastole, with each component contributing to LV ejection and filling, respectively. Here, we extend previous literature examining this strain-volume relationship, by showing that LV ejection fraction, along with peak ejection and peak filling rates, can be accurately derived by integrating discrete strain components along the cardiac cycle. The utility of this approach is highlighted by demonstrating\nthat each integrated component effectively differentiates participants along the HF continuum.\nImpaired LV strain is a well-established indicator of poor clinical status in a variety of populations [15, 18, 22\u201324]. However, interpretation of LV strain is often complicated when one principal strain component is elevated while the other is reduced [15, 18, 25, 26]. The potential major advantage of integrating circumferential and longitudinal strain to calculate LV ejection fraction, over conventional discrete strain approaches, is that both measures are condensed into a single measure of overall LV volumetric function. Indeed, LV ejection fraction is the product of circumferential and longitudinal tissue deformation, each contributing independently to volumetric changes across the cardiac cycle. This strain-volume relationship therefore helps to explain how ejection fraction can be maintained (or even increase) despite abnormalities in systolic strain in one direction [15, 18], providing valuable insight into the relative contributions of each strain component to volumetric function (as illustrated in Fig.\u00a04).\nThe integration of circumferential and longitudinal strain rates to predict peak ejection and peak filling\nrates extends prior reports that have focused only on LV ejection fraction [13\u201316]. While the clinical utility of assessing peak ejection and peak filling rates is well established [20, 21, 27\u201333], the approach is typically dependent upon either invasive LV catheterization methods [21, 29] or on manual contouring of images of the LV to generate volume-time relationships [20, 27]. Indeed, invasive LV hemodynamic assessment is associated with high risk and is often not feasible in many clinical and sub-clinical populations. While non-invasive assessment of volumetric ejection and filling rates using image-based volume-time curves avoids many of these limitations, this approach is time-consuming and highly user-dependent, reducing its overall clinical utility and feasibility. Thus, the proposed integrated strain approach offers a major advantage, given that most strain analysis is semi-automated, with minimal user input. Integrating circumferential and longitudinal strain rates is also attractive because it has the potential to reduce the overall number of endpoint measurements reported and expresses the results in volume normalized units of measure.\nData are counts and percentages, mean \u00b1 standard deviation or median and interquartile range.

The theoretical framework for which the integrated strain concept is based is specific for endocardial strain and strain rates only. Indeed, due to the gradual change in fiber orientation and associated strain seen from the LV endocardial to mid-wall layers [7, 10\u201312], inclusion of information not exclusive to the endocardial border in-validates the mathematical assumptions of the current work. This is important, because strain is typically reported as a transmural strain.
