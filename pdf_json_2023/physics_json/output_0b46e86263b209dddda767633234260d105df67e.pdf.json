Actinomycetes are the largest reservoir of microbial natural products with interesting bioactivities and have been useful in diverse applications in agriculture and medicine [2]. As an alternative source to the conventionally used terrestrial microorganisms, actinomycetes are ubiquitous in marine environments and are considered an appealing source of novel structures for new drug discovery [3]. The genus Salinispora was reported as the first obligate marine actinomycetal genus. Until now, three closely related species from this genus, including Salinispora tropica, S. arenicola, and S. pacifica, have been identified [4]. Members of this genus were commonly found in various substrates in marine environments, including tropical and subtropical sediments, tropical sponges, ascidians, and seaweeds [5]. Although their discovery was relatively late, more than 50 secondary metabolites with a broad range of chemical scaffolds, such as salinosporamides, rifamycins, lomaiviticins, cyclomarins, and salinaphthoquinones, as well as many inspired muta- and semi-synthesis structures, have been reported from this genus [6]. Among the reported compounds, salinosporamide A showed significant activity against various types of cancer and has now entered clinical studies [7]. Based on the unique living conditions and diverse biosynthetic abilities, the genus is considered an emerging source of leading structures for future drug discovery. Rifamycins are a group of antibiotics produced by several actinomycetes, such as Amycolatopsis, Streptomyces, Micormonospora, and Salinispora [8\u201311]. The rifamycin group,\nMar.

The structures of rifamycins are quite unique and consist of an aromatic moiety bridged by an aliphatic chain. The aromatic part can be a naphthalene or naphthoquinone ring, and the aliphatic chain is called an ansachain [13]. The biosynthesis of rifamycins has been well studied, and their structures were confirmed by X-ray crystallography and total synthesis research [14]. To date, the absolute configuration of the ansa-chain was reported to be identical in all rifamycin derivatives [15]. As part of our ongoing research on natural products produced by actinomycetes near Dokdo island, Republic of Korea, the strain 225DD-027 was isolated from a sediment sample and was identified as Salinispora arenicola by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. The strain produced orange pigments, which were primarily speculated as rifamycin analogs from a literature review. In a small culture (1 L), the production of pigments was relatively low, and it was insufficient for structural elucidation. Therefore, a mass culture was conducted to obtain a sufficient amount and to determine the structures and biological properties of the pigments. As a result, eight rifamycin-related polyketides, including three new compounds (1, 6, and 7, Figure 1), were isolated, and the details of their isolation, structure determination, and bioactivities are described in this paper.\nMar.

The 1H and 13C NMR data of 1 were almost identical to those of the isolated compound, 34a-\u03b1-rifamycin W-M1-hemiacetal (2).

The 13C and HSQC spectra revealed signals of 36 carbons belonging to a ketone at \u03b4C 197.6 (C-11); two carbonyls at \u03b4C 172.3 (C-15) and 174.0 (C-35); sixteen sp2 carbons at \u03b4C 112.2\u2013175.5; a hemiketal at \u03b4C 108.5 (C-12); four oxygenated methines at \u03b4C 68.5\u201378.3; an oxygenated methylene at \u03b4C 62.1 (C-36); four methines at \u03b4C 34.5\u201341.8; and seven methyls at \u03b4C 8.8\u201321.5. The continuous 1H-1H COSY correlations from H-17 to H-29 via H3-31, H3-32, H3-33, and H3-34, as well as the HMBC correlations from H3-30 to C-15, C-16, and C-17, established the structure of an ansa-chain. The HMBC correlations from H3-14 to C-6, C-7, and C-8; from H-3 to C-1 and C-10; from H-8 to C-1, C-6, C-10, and C-14 established a naphthalene ring with three hydroxy groups at the C-1, C-4, and C-6 positions. The HMBC correlations from H-29 to C-12, H3-13 to C-11, and C-12 confirmed the structure of a furan ring and the connection of the ansa-chain with the aromatic moiety via an ether bond between C-29 and C-12. Further, the HMBC correlations from H-36a,b to C-35 determined the presence of glycolic acid. By comparison with data reported in the literature, the structure of 6 was determined as 8-deoxy-25-desacetyl-27-demethyl-rifamycin L [16] and named salinisporamycin D. Compound 7 was isolated as a colorless solid. The molecular formula of 7 was determined as C22H37NO6 by HRESIMS data (m/z 434.2496, [M + Na]+, calcd for [C22H37NO6Na]+ 434.2513, \u22123.9 ppm), five degrees of unsaturation. The 1H NMR spectrum of 7 (Table 2) revealed the presence of three olefinic protons at \u03b4H 6.17 (d, J = 11.1 Hz, H-3), 6.58 (dd, J = 15.2 and 11.1 Hz, H-4), and 5.78 (d, J = 15.2 and 8.3 Hz, H-5); five oxygenated methines at \u03b4H 3.46\u20134.05; four methines at \u03b4H 1.81\u20132.34; a methylene group at \u03b4H 2.63 and 2.75 (H-15a and H-15b); and six methyls at \u03b4H 0.95\u20132.18. The 13C and HSQC NMR spectra demonstrated the presence of 22 carbons, including a ketocarbonyl at \u03b4C 210.3 (C-16); a carboxyl at \u03b4C 175.1 (C-1); four olefinic carbons at \u03b4C 128.3\u2013142.1; five oxygenated methines at \u03b4C 75.6\u201383.5; four methines at \u03b4C 36.3\u201344.0; a methylene at \u03b4C 48.5 (C-15); and six methyls at \u03b4C 10.6\u201330.6. The 1H and 13C NMR data of 7 were similar to those of the co-isolated known compound, saliniketal A (8). The significant downfield chemical shifts of C-11 (\u03b4C 83.5), C-13 (\u03b4C 82.7), and C-14 (\u03b4C 80.8), and the HMBC correlation from H-14 (\u03b4H 3.95) to C-11 confirmed the partial structure of a tetrahydrofuran ring between C-11 and C-14. The NOESY correlation between H-11, H3-22, H-13, and H-15a,b indicated their co-facial relationship, and that of H-14/H-12 indicated that H-14 and H-12 were located on the opposite face of the tetrahydrofuran ring. Saliniketals A and B are bicyclic polyketides isolated from a Salininispora arenicola strain [15]. Their structures were elucidated by the 2D NMR techniques and were confirmed by total synthesis studies [8]. Saliniketals shared a partially similar structure with the ansa-chain of rifamycin derivatives isolated from the same strain. The biosynthesis studies also confirmed this relationship, and saliniketals and rifamycin derivatives shared the same absolute configuration [9]. By comparing 1H and 13C NMR data and the experimental ECD spectrum of 7 with those of saliniketal A (8) and considering their biosynthetic relationship, the absolute configuration of 7 was proposed to be the same as that of saliniketal A (8) and named salinifuran A.\nMar. Drugs 2023, 21, 494 7 of 13\nStructures of known compounds were identified as 34a-\u03b1-rifamycin W-M1-hemiacetal (2), 34a-\u03b2-rifamycin W-M1-hemiacetal (3) [9], rifamycin W (4) [17], protorifamycin I (5) [18], and saliniketal A (8) [19] by comparison of their spectroscopic data with those reported in the literature. Rifamycins are a group of antimicrobial drugs, and their mode of action, resistance, and biosynthesis have been well studied [20]. Previous studies showed that the biosynthesis of rifamycins starts with 3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid (AHBA) and chain extension by various rifamycin biosynthetic genes. The ansa-chain was established from two acetates and eight propionates [15]. Numerous structures of naturally occurring rifamycins are mainly due to the extensive post-PKS enzymatic tailoring conducted by enzymes encoded by pathway-specific genes [15]. Similarly, the possible biosynthesis pathway of the new compounds was proposed, as shown in Figure 4. Firstly, proansamycin X was synthesized, and then the compound was converted to rifamycin W. Rifamycin W was oxidized to rifamycin Z, and then this compound was converted to demethly-desacetyl rifamycin SV. Compound 1 could be originated from rifamycin Z by oxidation and decyclization at the C-5 position. Compound 6 could be synthesized from demethly-desacetyl rifamycin SV by deoxidation at C-8 and adding glycolic acid (from an acetate unit) at the C-4 position. The biosynthesis of 7 was proposed to be similar to saliniketals. Rifamycin W was converted to a percussor (11) via several steps, and 11 could be reduced and cyclized to give a tetrahydrofuran-containing derivative (13), and then the napthoquinone moiety was eliminated to yield salinifuran (7). Some isolated compounds were screened for their cytotoxicity against one normal, six solid, and seven blood cancer cell lines (Table 3). According to the guidelines of NCI, when a compound shows cytotoxicity with an IC50 value less than 4 \u00b5g/mL or 10 \u00b5M, the compound is considered to have cytotoxicity [21]. We defined the potency of compounds as significant (IC50 < 1 \u00b5M), moderate (IC50 = 1\u201310 \u00b5M), weak (IC50 = 10\u201330 \u00b5M), and non-cytotoxic (IC50 > 30 \u00b5M). Compound 1 showed moderate activity against all the tested cell lines with GI50 of 2.36\u20139.96 \u00b5M. Compound 6 exhibited weak cytotoxicity against solid cancer cells with GI50 values of 21.84\u201329.75 \u00b5M. Compound 7 showed weak activity against NALM6 (GI50 = 26.76 \u00b5M). Compound 8 was not active against all the tested cell lines (GI50 > 30 \u00b5M). From the activity results, it is noteworthy that rifamycin derivatives showed moderate or weak cytotoxicity, and the aromatic moiety is important for their cytotoxicity (1 and 6). Compounds 7 and 8 are composed of only an ansa-chain and showed weak or no cytotoxicity. The lack of a hydroxy group at the C-8 position (6) may reduce the activity. The results of this study were consistent with previous reports that naturally occurring\nMar. Drugs 2023, 21, 494 8 of 13\nrifamycins are generally not effective enough for new drug development.

Each sample was weighed to 1.0 g, placed on a sterile plate, and kept at 60 \u25e6C for 30 min in a dry oven. The samples were then successively diluted to 10\u22121, 10\u22122, and 10\u22123 by sterile seawater, and each aliquot (100 \u00b5L) was spread on humic acid\u2013vitamin agar (HV), actinomycetes isolation agar (AIA), and Bennett\u2019s agar (BN) media. The plates were kept in a BOD (bio-oxygen demand) incubator at 28 \u25e6C for\nMar. Drugs 2023, 21, 494 10 of 13\n1~4 weeks until colonies could be seen with the naked eye. Colonies that could be seen were picked up and transferred onto new BN agar plates. The purification procedure was carried out repeatedly several times until single pure colonies were obtained."

Firstly, the strain was cultured on Bennett\u2019s agar medium in a Petri dish for 14 days. The actively grown colonies were transferred aseptically into a 100 mL conical flask containing 50 mL of Bennett\u2019s broth medium and incubated on a rotary shaker (140 rpm) at 28 \u25e6C for 9 days. An aliquot (10 mL) was aseptically inoculated into a 2.0 L flask containing 1.0 L of BN broth. The strain was incubated at 28 \u25e6C for 7 days on a rotary shaker at 140 rpm, and then the culture broth was inoculated into a 100 L fermenter filled with 70 L of BN broth. The mass culture was carried out at 28 \u25e6C for 16 days and then harvested. The culture was separated into supernatant and mycelium by continuous centrifugation at 60,000 rpm, and the supernatant was extracted twice with an equal volume of EtOAc (70 L \u00d7 2). The EtOAc layer was evaporated under reduced pressure to obtain a crude extract (8.0 g).

The gross structures of the new compounds were elucidated by detailed analysis of their spectroscopic data (HRESIMS, 1D, and 2D NMR). Their absolute configuration was established by consideration of their biosynthetic relationship and comparison of their NMR chemical shifts, 1H-1H coupling constants, and ECD spectra with those of the co-isolated derivatives. The new compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxicity against one normal, six solid, and seven blood cancer cell lines, and 1 displayed moderate cytotoxicity against all the tested cancer cell lines with GI50 ranging from 2.36 to 9.96 \u00b5M. Further investigations should be performed to comprehend the mechanism of action of the active metabolites. The findings of this report have enriched the biological and chemical diversities of naturally occurring polyketides from the genus Salinispora.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/md21090494/s1.
