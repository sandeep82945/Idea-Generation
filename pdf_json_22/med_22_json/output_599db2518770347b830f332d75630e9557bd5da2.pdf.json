            "text": "Page 2/25\n56.06, 18.19 min\u2212 1mM\u2212 1 for NADP+, respectively, and those for NAD+ and NADP+ were 374.64 and 2001.64 min\u2212 1mM\u2212 1 using D-galactose, and 227.98 and 2661.27 min\u2212 1mM\u2212 1 using L-arabinose, respectively. TmAraDH exhibited complete conversion in 12 h at 70oC to D-galactonate with 5 mM Dgalactose. Modelling provides structural insights into the cofactor and substrate recognition speci city. Our results suggest that TmAraDH have great potential for the conversion of L-arabinose and D-galactose into rare sugar acids.\nIntroduction D-galactose is one of the diverse sugars found in nature, particularly present at 25\u201335% dry weight in red macroalgae (Kim et al. 2010; Liu et al. 2020), and 37.5% of the total dry material in whey (a lactose-rich resource) from the dairy industry (Siso 1996). L-arabinose is widely distributed in arabinose-containing hemicelluloses, such as arabinan, arabinoxylan, gumarabic, and arabinogalactan (such as 44.9% arabinose in Rice bran neutral xylan, 33.5% arabinose in Wheat arabinoxylan). These sugars have been utilized in the production of various biofuels and platform chemicals via biological and/or chemical methods (Dowdells et al. 2010). L-arabinose and D-galactose could be oxidized by L-arabinose/Dgalactose 1-dehydrogenase (AraDH) to sugar acids such as L-arabonate and D-galactonate, respectively. These sugar acids, being chemically similar to gluconic acid, are valuable raw materials for the cosmetic, pharmaceutical, food and construction industries and are of great economic value. (Ramachandran et al. 2006; Zhou et al. 2018). Microbial and enzymatic production of other sugar acids such as D-xylonate, Dgalactonate and L-arabonate has not been commercialized yet. Therefore, in recent years, more attention has been paid to thermal enzymes that improve industrial production and enable the conversion of lowcost substrates into rare products with high added value. Currently, different kinds of enzymes have been studied to produce sugar acids, including L-arabinose/D-galactose 1-dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.-), Larabinose 1-dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.46), D-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.117), and D-galactose 1-dehydrogenase. So far, L-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase has been found in Rhizobium (Margaret. 1979; Dilworth et al. 1986), Azospirillum Brasilense (Novick and Tyler 1982; Watanabe et al. 2006), Herbaspirillum seropedicae (Mathias et al. 1989) and Haloferax volcanii (Johnsen et al. 2013). Dgalactose 1-dehydrogenase has been obtained in Pseudomonas uorescens (Maier and Kurz 1982; Sperka et al. 1989), Pseudomonas saccharophila (Ueberschar et al. 1974) and Rhizobium leguminosarum bv.trifolii (Aro-Karkkainen et al. 2014). However, there are few reports on L-arabinose or D-\nPage 3/25\ngalactose 1-dehydrogenase from the thermophilic bacteria, and still a great need for nding better oxidoreductases than those currently tested, in order to compete with traditional chemical methods to produce sugar acids. With these prerequisites, higher activity, and stability of oxidoreductases from hyperthermophiles should attract considerable attention as characteristics of the most effective biocatalysts.\nThe hyperthermophile Thermatoga maritima grows optimally above 80\u00b0C, degrades a broad range of hexoses and pentoses as well as starch and xylan (Conners et al. 2006). It is of considerable interest because of the hyperthermostability of their enzymes (Huber et al. 1986), which possesses the largest number of proteins catalyzing industrially relevant oxidoreductions (Niehaus et al. 1999). A putative Larabinose/D-galactose 1-dehydrogenase (TmAraDH) from Thermatoga maritima was identi ed. The gene (tm0312) encoding the TmAraDH was cloned and overexpressed in E. coli and the resulting protein was puri ed. The thermostable enzyme is a catalyst that selectively oxidases L-arabinose and D-galactose to L-arabonate and D-galactonate at 75\u00b0C. L-arabonate has a wide range of medical applications as cholesterol-lowing drugs and L- arabonolactone, a derivative of L-arabonate, has been reported can treat calcium oxalate urolithiasis by promoting calcium absorption (Sanai et al. 2007; Sanai and Tanaka 2010). D-galactonate is an important intermediate in synthesis, which can be used to produce surfactants derived from carbohydrates, and it is also a valuable raw material in cosmetics, pharmaceutical, food and construction industries. In this view, the thermostable TmAraDH has broad industrial potential.\nMaterials And Methods\nStrains, plasmids, and culture conditions Thermotoga maritima was purchased from the American strain Collection Center, under the serial number ATCC43589. Escherichia coli (DE 3) (Promega, Madison, WI) was used as hosts for the expression of tm0312 from Thermotoga maritima via the T7 RNA polymerase expression system with pET-20b plasmids (Novagen, USA). Cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium supplemented with 100 \u00b5g ampicillin ml\u2212 1. Molecular cloning Regular DNA operations were performed as described in Molecular cloning (Chong 2001). Based on the DNA sequence of putative L-arabinose/D-galactose 1-dehydrogenase (TmAraDH) gene (tm0312) from Thermatoga maritima, two synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides P1 (5\u2032- CGCCATATGGTGAAGCCTTTGAGAAAAAT-3\u2032) and P2 (5\u2032-CCCAAGCTTCAACAGACTGGAAACGAAC-3\u2032) were used as primers. The TmAraDH gene was ampli ed using T. maritima genomic DNA as the template. The ampli ed DNA fragment was digested with Nde I and Hind III, which was then ligated into the E. coli expression vector pET-20b. The resulting pET-20b-TmAraDH was sequenced by Sangon Biotech (Shanghai). Overexpression and protein puri cation\nPage 4/25\nThe expression plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) and induced to express the recombinant TmAraDH with a C-terminal tag of six histidines by adding isopropyl-\u03b2-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a nal concentration of 0.8 mM at OD600 about 0.8 and incubated further at 37\u00b0C for about 8 h. The induced cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4\u00b0C for 30 min at 6,000\u00d7g. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice with water, resuspended in 10 ml binding buffer (50 mM Phosphate buffer, 0.3 M NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, pH 8.0) and disrupted by an ultrasonic cell crusher (working 5 s, resting 10 s). The crude extract was obtained by centrifugation at 6000\u00d7g, 4\u00b0C, 20 min and loaded onto an immobilized metal a nity column (IMAC) lling Ni-chelating resin (Novagen). Unbound proteins were washed off by binding buffer and then by washing buffer (50 mM Phosphate buffer, 0.3 M NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, pH 8.0), the his-tagged TmAraDH was eluted by eluting buffer (50 mM Phosphate buffer, 0.3 M NaCl, 500 mM imidazole, pH 8.0), and collected in 5 ml fractions. The fraction was used as the puri ed enzyme for subsequent analysis by the sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSPAGE) using 10% polyacrylamide running gels with 4% polyacrylamide stacking gels. Amio acid sequence alignment and Phylogenetic tree analysis By searching the literature and NCBI database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), the amino acid sequences of L-arabinose/D-galactose 1-dehydrogenase from different sources were obtained. These sequences were compared with TmAraDH by ClustalW (https://www.genome.jp/tools-bin/clustalw) and the results of sequence alignment were plotted and analyzed by ENDscript/ESPript (http://espript.ibcp.fr/ESPript/cgi-bin/ESPript.cgi). The phylogenetic tree was produced using the MEGA-X program. Enzyme assays L-arabinose/D-galactose 1-dehydrogenase activity was assayed routinely in the direction of L-arabinose oxidation by measuring the reduction of Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) or Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+) at 340 nm at 75\u00b0C using spectrophotometer. The standard assay mixture contained 10 mM L-arabinose in 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) buffer. The reaction was started by the addition of 10 mM NAD(P)+ solution with a nal reaction volume of 0.6 ml. The enzyme amounts used for determining the speci c activity of sugar substrates were 0.755 mg/ml. One unit of the dehydrogenase activity is de ned as the amount of enzyme which caused the reduction of 1\u00b5mol of NAD(P)+ per min under the above assay conditions whereas the speci c activity was calculated as enzyme activity per mg protein. Oxidation reactions with substrates (D-xylose, D-galactose, Darabinose D-fucose, D-glucose, D-Mannose, L-xylose, L-fucose, L-sorbose and D-fructose) were performed in the same conditions as for L-arabinose. Properties of the recombinant enzyme The pH on activity of the puri ed TmAraDH was determined with 10 mM L-arabinose and 1 mM NAD+ in the pH range from 4.5 to 9.0 using 100 mM phosphate buffer. The pH stability of enzyme was determined\nPage 5/25\nafter preserved in 100 mM phosphate buffer ranging from 4.0 to 9.0 at rooming temperature (37\u00b0C) for 1 h.\nThe temperature on activity of the puri ed TmAraDH was determined with 10 mM L-arabinose and 1 mM NAD+ at temperature range from 30 to 95\u00b0C using 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 8.0). The temperature thermostability of enzyme was determined after preserved in 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) at different temperature (30\u201390\u00b0C) for 1 h and at 60, 65, 70, and 75\u00b0C for 0\u201324 h.\nThe effect of metal ions and surfactants on enzyme activity was assessed under standard conditions in the presence of 1 mM various metal ions (Zn2+, Mn2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Cu2+, Li+, Ni2+), 1 mM EDTA and 5% surfactants (Tween 80 and Triton X-100). The activity of TmAraDH without metal ions, chemical agents or surfactants addition was de ned as 100%.\nVarious concentrations of D-galactose, L-arabinose (1\u201350 mM), and NAD(P)+ (from 0.1 mM to 10 mM) were used to determine kinetic parameters of the enzyme. The reactions were performed in phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) at 75\u00b0C for 5 min. The Km and kcat were determined by the Lineweaver-Burk plot from the Michaelis-Menten equation. To calculate the catalytic constant kcat, the amount of protein was divided by the subunit molecular mass of 36.54 kDa. Protein content was determined by the method of Bradford (Hammond and Kruger 1988), using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard protein. All reactions were done in triplicate, and the relative standard deviation was < 2%. Analytical methods Enzymatical reaction substrate D-galactose was analyzed by HPLC. Enzymatical reaction samples were prepared as follows: the sample solution was centrifuged for 2 min at 6000\u00d7g and added 10% acetonitrile, then ltered with a disposable organic membrane of 0.45 \u00b5m. 10 \u00b5l of this solution were then analyzed by HPLC. The retention time for D-galactose was 12.960 min.\nHPLC analysis was performed with an instrument equipped with an Agilent amino column (ZORBAX NH2, 4.6 mm \u00d7 250 mm, 5 \u00b5m). A mixed solvent of water/acetonitrile was used as the mobile phase at a ow rate of 1.0 ml/min at 40\u00b0C, and the elution of compounds was detected with a refractive index detector RID-10A. It was qualitatively determined by retention time, quanti ed by peak area, and calculated by external standard method. D-galactonate could not be accurately quanti ed using this HPLC method as it partially co-elutes with D-galactose. Therefore, the generated D-galactonate concentrations were measured by the hydroxamate method reported previously (Lien 1959), the sample (0.08 ml) was diluted in 0.1 ml of 0.05 M HCl for pH 1.5-2.0 and boiled at 100\u00b0C for 15 min (D-galactonate was rst converted to D-galactonolactone). The boiled sample (0.1 ml) was added into 0.2 ml of hydroxylamine reagent (2 M hydroxylamine HCl in 2 M NaOH), then added with 100 \u00b5l of 0.7 M HCl and nally with 100 \u00b5l of FeCl3 solution (100 g FeCl3 l\u2212 1 in 0.1 M HCl). Absorbance was immediately measured at 550 nm. D-galactonate was quanti ed against a standard curve.\nPage 6/25\nLC-MS analysis of the reaction product was performed using a Poroshell 120 HILIC_Z (2.1 mm \u00d7100 mm, 2.7 \u00b5m, Agilent, USA) coupled to AB Sciex Instruments Triple TOF 4600-1 Hybrid Quadrupole-TOF LC/MS/MS and operated in negative-ion mode. The enzyme puri ed from T. maritima was used for the product identi cation. Samples were ltered (0.45 \u00b5m, Millipore) and 10 \u00b5l was directed injected. The separation was performed using a Poroshell 120 HILIC_Z column (2.1 mm \u00d7 100 mm, 2.7 \u00b5m, Agilent, USA) protected by a pre-column with acetonitrile-10 mM NH4FA (pH 9.5) as the mobile phase. The curtain gas (CUR) was 35 psi, the ion source atomized gas (GS1) and the heating auxiliary gas (GS2) were 55 psi, the spray voltage (ISVF) was 4500 V, the atomization temperature (TEM) was 500\u00b0C, and the impact energy (CE) in the secondary mass spectrometry was 35 \u00b1 15 V.The pulse frequency was 15.392 kHz, and the StartMass and EndMass were 50 and 1000, respectively. The data was collected by Masshunter. Galactonate production from galactose using recombinant enzyme To evaluate the oxidation of TmAraDH towards galactose, 0.16 mg/ml of puri ed TmAraDH was added to the 0.3 ml of 5 mM galactose and 6 mM NAD+ in 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), and allowed to react at 70\u00b0C for 24 h. Reaction samples were taken at 5 min, 20 min, 40 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 12 h and 24 h, analyzed by HPLC to monitor the enzymatic hydrolysis process. Application of TmAraDH in galactonate production was performed with different concentrations of D-galactose (10 mM, 20 mM, 40 mM), equimolar concentration of NAD+ (10 mM, 20 mM, 40 mM) were performed in the same conditions as for above 5 mM galactose. Substrate-docking analysis The crystal structure of the L-arabinose/D-galactose 1-dehydorgenase from T. maritima (Protein Data Bank [PDB] accession code 1ZH8) was downloaded from the PDB database and was used for further docking studies. The 3D structures of ligand molecules D-galactose and L-arabinose were searched and downloaded from the PubChem Compound database on the NCBI website (D-galactose CID: 6036, Larabinose CID: 439195). The energy of small molecules D-galactose, L-arabinose, NAD+ and NADP+ was processed by ChemBioO ce 3D Ultral 3.0 software, and the 3D structure of ligand small molecules was con rmed and optimized by Minimize Energy of MM2 algorithm (the minimum RMS was set to 0.01 and terminated after 1000 iterations). Then the optimized stable structure was saved as PDB format for subsequent experiments. Hydrogen atoms were added to the protein crystal structure and ligand molecules AutoDock vina was used to dock the ligand (D-galactose and L-arabinose) with NADP-bound TmAraDH and Discovery studio (DS 3.1, Accelrys Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) was used to analyze the docking results.\nResults\nOverexpression and protein puri cation\nPage 7/25\nThe gene encoding a putative L-arabinose/D-galactose 1-dehydrogenase (TmAraDH) in Thermatoga maritima, tm0312, was cloned and ligated into the pET-20b expression vector. The resulting pET-20bTmAraDH plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) for TmAraDH expression. The recombinant TmAraDH was overexpressed, and was puri ed to gel electrophoretic homogeneity by immobilized Nia nity chromatography (Fig. 1,\u00a0Lane 2), and had apparent molecular masses of 36.54 kDa on SDS-PAGE, which was in accordance with the theoretically calculated molecular mass. Phylogenetic tree analysis and amino acid sequence alignment A search of the NCBI BLAST database revealed that TmAraDH had high homology to several putative Gfo/Idh/MocA family protein, which includes GFOR, D-xylose 1-dehydrogenase, dimeric dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (DD), and myo-inositol 2-dehydrogenase. In the unrooted phylogenetic tree, these enzymes containing L-arabinose dehydrogenase and D-galactose dehydrogenase formed a single subfamily B (Fig. 2). TmAraDH belongs to family A which belongs to same branch with family B, suggest TmAraDH is a thermophilic bacteria L-arabinose/D-galactose 1-dehydrogenase member of the the Gfo/Idh/MocA protein family. As BLAST analysis of the deduced TmAraDH with other known L-arabinose dehydrogenases (AraDHs) or D-galactose dehydrogenase (GalDHs), the translated TmAraDH sequence had 18.21% identity to Haloferax volcanii DS2 deduced D-galactose/L-arabinose dehydrogenase (Hartman et al. 2010) (GI: 291369903), 17.07% to Azospirillum brasilense L-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase (Watanabe et al. 2019) (GI: 1653017196), and 16.77% to Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. Trifolii D-galactose/L-arabinose dehydrogenase (Aro-Karkkainen et al. 2014) (GI: 695131843). It contained the conserved Asp186 and Tyr/His/Asn (His190 in TmAraDH) residues that have important roles in the catalytic activity of Gfo/Idh/MocA family members, putative cofactor binding pocket sequence motif Gly13-X-Gly15-Ile16-XAla18-Arg19, Ser40, Arg41, as well as a EKP motif Glu100-Lys101-Pro102 that has some key structural or functional role (Fig. 3). These regions are typical for reported AraDHs. These results show that TmAraDH is a thermophilic bacteria member of the the Gfo/Idh/MocA protein family. Simultaneously, these corresponding Lys101, Asp186, and His190 residues in the\u00a0TmAraDH are located in the substrate binding site of our 3D model, supporting the reliability. Properties of the recombinant enzyme The dependence of TmAraDH activity on pH was shown in Fig. 4a. TmAraDH displayed maximum activity at pH 8.0 and more than 60% of relative activity during the range of pH 7.0\u20139.0. The relative activity of TmAraDH was over 60% when enzyme incubated at pH 7.0\u20139.0 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C (Fig. 4b). The activity decreased rapidly when under acidic conditions for 1 h, with a relative activity below 32%. TmAraDH was almost inactivated by incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h at pH 4.5 while it held 3.27% activity without incubation.\nThe dependence of TmAraDH activity on temperature was shown in Fig. 4c. TmAraDH exhibited the highest activity at 75\u00b0C, and more than 50% of maximum activity over a temperature range (55\u201380\u00b0C). The enzymatic activity of TmAraDH was low at temperatures below 60\u00b0C with its relative activity below\nPage 8/25\n55%. With the increase of temperature, the relative activity of TmAraDH gradually decreased. After TmAraDH incubated for 1 h between 30\u201370\u00b0C, the relative activity did not change much and was close to 100% (Fig. 4d). When enzyme was incubated at 80\u00b0C for 1 h, 64.7% of activity remained. TmAraDH exhibited 63.7% relative activity after it was incubated for 24 h at 60\u00b0C. The half-life (t1/2) values of TmAraDH at 65, 70, 75\u00b0C were 22.2, 18.7, 11.0 h, respectively (Fig. 4e).\nThe effect of metal ions and surfactants on the activity of TmAraDH was investigated, and the results indicated that the activity was litter enhanced in the presence of the Li+, Zn2+, Mg2+ and obviously enhanced in the presence of Ca2+ and EDTA (Fig. 4f). The inhibitory effects of 1 mM Mn2+, Fe2+ and Ni2+ were observed, and retained 89.75%, 98.08% and 73.42% relative activity, respectively. However, when the activity of TmAraDH was determined in the presence of 1 mM Cu2+, 5% Tween 80 and 5% TritonX-100 only 6.18%, 17.23% and 27.47% of the initial activity was remained. In addition to L-arabinose, various pentoses and hexoses were tested as substrate for TmAraDH. Enzyme activities and the stereocon guration of these sugars are shown in Fig. 5. Activity was observed with Larabinose (100%), D-galactose (96%), D-fucose (72%), D-glucose (24%), D-Mannose (23%), D-xylose (20%), L-xylose (11%), D-arabinose (11%) and L-fucose (8%) and was not observed with L-sorbose and Dfructose. TmAraDH showed major activity towards pentose sugars (L-arabinose) and hexose sugars (Dgalactose and D-fucose), and favors L-arabinose, D-galactose and D-fucose, which indicates that the enzyme only accepts substrates with this speci c con guration at the C-2, C-3, and C-4 positions, indicating that the enzyme's activity is not dependent on the C-5 and C-6 con guration. In contrast, the overall low activity for D-xylose (the C-4 epimer of L-arabinose), D-glucose (the C-4 epimer of D-galactose) and D-mannose (the C-2 and C-4 epimer of D-galactose), suggest that the conformation at C-4 of the sugar is critical for substrate recognition by\u00a0TmAraDH. The kinetic parameters (Km, kcat, and kcat/Km) were determined for the two most preferred substrates (Larabinose and D-galactose) at pH 8.5 using xed concentrations of the cofactors (Table 1). The catalytic e ciency (kcat/Km) values of TmAraDH with L-arabinose and D-galactose in the presence of NAD+ were 123.85, and 179.26 min\u2212 1mM\u2212 1, and in the presence of NADP+ were 56.06 and 18.19 min\u2212 1mM\u2212 1, respectively. The kinetic parameters of D-galactose were very similar to those of L-arabinose in the presence of either NAD+ or NADP+, indicating that the enzyme functions not only as L-arabinose 1- dehydrogenase but also \u201cD-galactose 1-dehydrogenase\u201d, which is similar to L-arabinose/D-galactose 1- dehydrogenase from Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. Trifolii (Aro-Karkkainen N et al., 2014). Subsequently, kinetic constants for NAD+ and NADP+ were also measured using D-galactose and L-arabinose as the substrate. As can be seen at Table 1, the Km value for NADP+ with D-galactose as the substrate was about twofold smaller than for NAD+ and the speci city constant (kcat/Km) about sixfold higher, and the Km value for NADP+ with L-arabinose as the substrate was about sixfold smaller than for NAD+ and the kcat/Km about twelvefold higher, indicating that TmAraDH prefers NADP+ as its coenzyme. \u00a0\nPage 9/25\nTable 1 kinetic parameters of recombinant L-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase\nsubstrate coenzyme Km (mM) Vmax (U/mg)\nkcat (min\u2212 1) kcat/Km (min\u2212 1mM\u2212 1)\nDgalactose\nNAD+ a 5.59 \u00b1 0.37 27.23 \u00b1 0.92\n994.99 \u00b1 33.54 179.26 \u00b1 7.29\nNADP+ b 28.08 \u00b1 2.44\n13.28 \u00b1 0.97\n485.42 \u00b1 35.37 18.19 \u00b1 0.26\nLarabinose\nNAD+ a 6.88 \u00b1 0.64 23.09 \u00b1 1.17\n843.58 \u00b1 42.64 123.85 \u00b1 4.86\nNADP+ b 3.32 \u00b1 0.26 5.04 \u00b1 0.14 184.11 \u00b1 4.94 56.06 \u00b1 2.59\nNAD+ (D-galactose) c\n1.12 \u00b1 0.09 11.32 \u00b1 0.92\n413.46 \u00b1 33.61 374.64 \u00b1 16.76\n(L-arabinose) d\n2.59 \u00b1 0.08 14.45 \u00b1 0.32\n527.90 \u00b1 11.74 227.98 \u00b1 5.99\nNADP+ (D-galactose) c\n0.88 \u00b1 0.04 48.39 \u00b1 0.76\n1768.35 \u00b1 27.73\n2001.64 \u00b1 61.55\n(L-arabinose) d\n0.45 \u00b1 0.01 32.87 \u00b1 0.63\n1200.95 \u00b1 22.90\n2661.27 \u00b1 48.60\nVarious concentrations of D-galactose, L-arabinose (1\u201350 mM), and NAD(P)+ (from 0.1 mM to 10 mM) were used to determine kinetic parameters of the enzyme. The reactions were performed in phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) at 75\u00b0C for 5 min. a Determined with 1 mM NAD+. b Determined with 1 mM NADP+. c Determined with 10 mM D-galactose. d Determined with 10 mM L-arabinose.

Galactonate production from galactose using TmAraDH\nThe oxidative conversion of galactose (5 mM) to galactonate was investigated at pH 7.0 and 70\u00b0C using 0.16 mg/ml puri ed recombinant TmAraDH. As indicated in Fig. 6a, the yield of galactonate was continuously increased in the rst 120 min, the galactonate production was as high as 3.92 mM at 2 h in the reaction system, which approximated to conversion of 52%. The amount of galactonate obtained from 2 to 12 h increased slowly from 3.92 mM to 5.0 mM, and the galactose were almost completely digested at 12 h. The conversion reaches 85.31%, 60.44% and 34.84% with 10 mM, 20 mM, and 40 mM substrate for 24 h, respectively (Fig. 6b).\nThe product D-galactonate was identi ed by LC-MS. The result is shown in Fig. 6c. The MS experiment in negative spray ionization mode shows that D-galactonate shows [M-H]-ion (Tr = 3.543 min) at M/Z 195.0517 and [M] at M/Z 196.0552, which is consistent with molecular weight of 196.153 (Fig. 6c). The\nPage 10/25\nabove results showed that D-galactonate exists in the reaction product of recombinant enzyme\u00a0TmAraDH. Substrate-docking analysis The crystal structures of the L-arabinose/D-galactose 1-dehydorgenase from T. maritima (Protein Data Bank [PDB] accession code 1ZH8) databases was used for docking analysis. Similar to other members of the Gfo/Idh/MocA family, the AraDH molecule forms two domains composed of eleven \u03b1-helices and fteen \u03b2-strands, with root mean square (r.m.s.) difference of 2.0. An N-terminal domain (residues 9-127) forms a Rossmann fold that has six-stranded parallel \u03b2-sheet surrounded by four \u03b1-helices. The Cterminal domain (residues 129\u2013326) consists of a nine-stranded \u03b2-sheet, of which the one side is solvent exposed, and six \u03b1-helices.\nThe cofactor is a prerequisite for the substrate binding in L-arabinose/D-galactose dehydrogenase family (Taberman et al. 2016). The 2\u2019-phosphate of NADP+ is within the permissible distance to form hydrogen bonds with Ser40 in the side chain, and with the nitrogen atoms of Arg41, Thr42 and His45 in the main chain (Fig. 7a).\nThe side chain of Lys101 and Pro102 and the main oxygen atom of Lys101 can form hydrogen bonds with the 2\u2019-and 3\u2019-hydroxyl groups of the nicotinamide ribose ring. The docking results show that 3D pyranose structure of L-arabinose and D-galactose ts well with the substrate-binding cavity and that the stereochemistry of L-arabinose and D-galactose is very similar, which may be important for strong binding and catalysis at the substrate-binding site. Docking result show that some hydrogen bonds are displayed between the sugars hydroxyl groups and the amino acid of TmAraDH, which is helpful to anchor the substrate in the correct position (Fig. 7b and 7c). In the docking model, the C-4 of the nicotinamide ring of NADP+ contacts C-1 of L-arabinose and D-galactose and the distance between two carbon atoms is 4.9 0A for L-arabinose and 5.3 0A for D-galactose, suggesting TmAraDH belongs to the NAD(P)+-dependent Gfo/Idh/MocA family proteins that their C-4 of the nicotinamide ring of NAD(P) + removes a hydride ion from the substrate, and then the catalytic base residue extracts a proton from the substrate.\nMoreover, His190 in the L-arabinose-and NADP+-bound form of TmAraDH can make a hydrogen bond to the OH-group bonded to C-1 of L-arabinose (Fig. 7b), and amino acids Asp186 in the D-galactose-and NADP+-bound form of TmAraDH make hydrogen bond to the OH-group bonded to C-3 and C-4 of Dgalactose (Fig. 7c). In addition, Arg174 and Gly187 of TmAraDH can make a hydrogen bound to the OHgroup bonded to C-1 and C-3, respectively, of both L-arabinose and D-galactose. These observations suggested that His187, and Arg174 as a catalytic base residue, removes a proton from the hydroxyl group at C-1 position and C-4 of substrates, and that His190 and Asp186 seems to be responsible for the recognition substrate L-arabinose and D-galactose, respectively. Given that TmAraDH has a 5-fold higher speci c activity with L-arabinose than that with D-xylose (Fig. 5), the C4 epimer of L-arabinose, His190 may contribute to discrimination between L-arabinose and D-xylose; and about 4-fold higher speci c\nPage 11/25\nactivity with D-galactose than that with D-glucose, the C-4 epimer of D-galactose (Fig. 5), Asp186 may contribute to discrimination between D-galactose and D-glucose.\nDiscussion In this work, a novel thermostable L-arabinose/D-galactose 1-dehydrogenase from Thermotoga maritima (TmAraDH) was cloned and highly expressed in E. coli. Puri ed TmAraDH showed signi cant NADP+preferring activity with similar catalytic e ciency for L-arabinose and D-galactose. The enzyme effectively catalyzed oxidation of D-galactose to D-galactonate, and has been demonstrated great industrially applications.\nA search of the NCBI database revealed that TmAraDH belongs to Gfo/Idh/MocA family oxidoreductase and the alignment to highly homologous genes and L-arabinose/D-galactose dehydrogenase of other sources in the database revealed that TmAraDH belongs to the same branch with other L-arabinose dehydrogenases (AraDHs) or D-galactose dehydrogenase (GalDHs) (family B, Fig.\u00a02), which indicates tm0312 gene encodes a thermostable L-arabinose/D-galactose 1-dehydrogenase (TmAraDH).\nIn general, subunit structures of the Gfo/Idh/MocA family consists of two structural domains, the Nterminal, and the C-terminal. The N-terminal structural domain has a characteristic GXGXX (G/A) amino acid sequence (Wierenga et al. 1985) in the classical \u03b2\u03b1\u03b2 dinucleotide binding pocket (Michael et al. 1975). Recently, a new class of ngerprint motifs for dehydrogenases has been postulated with the consensus AGKHVXCEKP (X is any amino acid) (Thomas et al. 1997). These motifs are also conserved in L-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase with little deviations. The amino acid sequence of TmAraDH was observed to contain a conserved GXGXX (G/A) sequence at the N terminal and a KGVHVXCEKP ngerprint sequence was observed at sites 93\u2013102, where Lys93 and Val95 are not conserved. These amino acids seem to be responsible for the recognition and binding of coenzyme NADP+ and form many hydrogen bonds with TmAraDH. The C-terminal domain contains some essential amino acid residues (Asp186, Gly187 and His190) for enzyme catalysis or substrate binding (Fig.\u00a03, closed triangle).\nIt was reported that many L-arabinose 1-dehydrogenas reached the high activity in alkaline environments, such as L-arabinose/D-galactose 1-dehydrogenase from Rhizobium leguminosarum (RlAraDH) (AroKarkkainen et al. 2014) and L-arabinose dehydrogenase from the haloarchaeon Haloferax volcanii (HvAraDH) (Johnsen et al. 2013) (Table\u00a02). TmAraDH showed maximum activity when pH was 8, which was consistent with most of the reported L-arabinose/D-galactose 1-dehydrogenase. The optimum temperature of L-arabinose dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas uorescens (PfAraDH) (Maier and Kurz 1982), and HvAraDH were at 45, 30\u00b0C (Table\u00a02), respectively. TmAraDH shows maximum activity at 75\u00b0C, which is apparently higher than that of PfAraDH and HvAraDH. The C-terminal fusion tag will affect the stability of the enzyme (Kallnik et al. 2011), however, TmAraDH, which fused Lys-Leu-Ala-Ala-Ala-Leu-Glu(His)6 at the C-terminal in this research, showed high stability from 30\u201370\u00b0C and maintained the original activity of 63.7% at 60\u00b0C for 24 h. These results suggested that the recombinant TmAraDH could\nPage 12/25\nmaintain high activity at high temperatures compared to other L-arabinose dehydrogenase or D-galactose dehydrogenase, which makes TmAraDH highly suitable for industrial biological processes.\nTable 2 kinetic parameters of L-arabinose/D-galactose dehydrogenase of different organism\nOrganism Topt (\u00b0C)\npHopt substrate coenzyme Km\n(mM)\nkcat/Km\n(min\u2212 1 mM\u2212 1)\nReferences\nAzospirillam brasilense\n- - Dgalactose\nNAD+ 1.49 798 (Watanabe S. et al., 2006) NADP+ 0.109 14400\nLarabinose\nNAD+ 1.41 806\nNADP+ 0.255 7860\nAzospirillam brasilense (WT)\n- - Dgalactose\nNAD+ - - (Yoshiwara K et al., 2020) NADP+ - -\nLarabinose\nNAD+ 3.5 835\nNADP+ 0.082 48600\nRhizobium leguminosarum\n- 9.0 Dgalactose\nNAD+ 0.48 4810 (AroKarkkainen N et al., 2014) NADP+ 0.50 8400\nLarabinose\nNAD+ 0.93 4240\nNADP+ 0.33 3810\nHaloferax volcanii 45 8.5 Dgalactose\nNADP+ - - (Johnsen U et al., 2013)\nLarabinose\nNADP+ 2.1 -\nPseudomonas uorescens\n30 9.1\u2013 9.5\nDgalactose\nNAD+ 0.24 - (Maier E and Kurz G, 1982) NADP+ 2.3 -\nLarabinose\nNAD+ - -\nNADP+ - -\nPage 13/25\nThe kinetic parameters of L-arabinose dehydrogenases and D-galactose dehydrogenases were summarized in Table\u00a02. Watanabe S. et al. have reported the L-arabinose/D-galactose dehydrogenase from Azospirillam brasilense (AbAraDH), showed that AbAraDH was a higher kcat/Km value for Dgalactose than for L-arabinose using NADP+ as coenzyme (its Km was about twofold lower with Dgalactose than with L-arabinose), and higher kcat/Km value for NADP+ than for NAD+ (its Km value for NADP+ lower than for NAD+) using L-arabinose as the substrate, but had a nearly equal Km and kcat/Km against L-arabinose and D-galactose using NAD+ as coenzyme. Aro-Karkkainen N. et al. described that the L-arabinose/D-galactose dehydrogenase from Rhizobium leguminosarum (RlAraDH) had a higher kcat/Km value against D-galactose than L-arabinose using NADP+ or NAD+ as coenzyme (its Km was about twofold lower against D-galactose than L-arabinose with NADP+ as coenzyme, but was about twofold higher against L-arabinose than D-galactose with NAD+ as coenzyme). However, the Larabinose/D-galactose dehydrogenase from T. maritima (TmAraDH) had a higher kcat/Km value for Dgalactose than for L-arabinose using NAD+ as coenzyme (its Km was a little lower with D-galactose than with L-arabinose), and higher kcat/Km value for NADP+ than for NAD+ (its Km value for NADP+ much smaller than for NAD+ ) using L-arabinose and D-galactose as the substrate, but was higher kcat/Km value against L-arabinose than D-galactose using NADP+ as coenzyme (its Km was about nine-fold lower against L-arabinose than D-galactose). In the NAD(P)+-dependent Gfo/Idh/MocA family, the cofactor is a prerequisite for the substrate binding. The side chains of the two amino acids Ser37 and Arg38 in the NADP+-bound form of AbAraDH of strictly NADP+-dependent Gfo/Idh/MocA members has been shown to bind 2-phosphate of NADP+ by hydrogen bonds (Watanabe et al. 2019), the corresponding position of Ser40 and Arg41 in the TmAraDH are located close to the 2-phosphate of NADP+ forming salt bridges or hydrogen bonds (Fig.\u00a07), suggested TmAraDH more tightly interacts with NADP+, which has the 2- phosphate group, than NAD+.\nIn subsequent preparation of D-galactonate from D-galactose, the result shows that TmAraDH effectively catalyzed oxidation of D-galactose (5 mM) to D-galactonate. As expected in the absence of a cofactorregenerating system, the yield was gradually decreased from 100 to 85.31, 60.44, and 34.84% when the substrate concentrations increased from 5 to 10, 20, and 40 mM, respectively. This galactose-togalactonate conversion process is being optimized in which the NADH oxidase TmNox1 was used to convert NADH to the required NAD+ for galactose oxidation by TmAraDH. The result showed that the feasibility of TmAraDH in D-galactonate high conversion for NAD+ regeneration, using a system coupling TmAraDH and TmNox1. This work will be the subject of a separate paper (Menke et al. manuscript in preparation). Although the results reported in this work demonstrate a biocatalytic route to produce Dgalactonate from D-galactose, it can also be extended to produce L-arabonate from L-arabinose. Therefore, the L-arabinose/D-galactose 1-dehydrogenase from T. maritima, combined characteristics of high thermostability, constitutes a powerful tool for product rare sugar acid industry applications, food industry applications, and has a considerable potential application in food production.\nPage 14/25\nIn conclusion, a novel thermostable L-arabinose/D-galactose 1-dehydrogenase TmAraDH from Thermotoga maritima was characterised and shown to be a potential biocatalyst for production of Dgalactonate. It encodes a protein (calculated molecular mass 36.54 kDa) of 328 amino acids that is a thermophilic bacteria member of the Gfo/Idh/MocA protein family and catalyzes the oxidation of Larabinose and D-galactose with NADP+/NAD+ as a cofactor. Several properties of TmAraDH, including its substrate speci city, thermostability, and utilization of renewable resources like lactose produced in whey, sugars in red macroalgae and arabinose-containing hemicelluloses, suggest that this enzyme is a potential biocatalyst to produce rare sugar acid D-galactonate and L-arabonate that has numerous industrially applications.\nDeclarations\nAcknowledgements This work was supported by grants from \u201cNational Key Research and Development Project\u201d of China (Grant No. 2019YFA0706900).\u00a0\nFunding This work was supported by grants from \u201cNational Key Research and Development Project\u201d of China (Grant No. 2019YFA0706900).\nCompeting interests\u00a0 The authors have no relevant nancial or non- nancial interests to disclose.\nAuthors\u2019 contributions All authors contributed to the study conception and design.
