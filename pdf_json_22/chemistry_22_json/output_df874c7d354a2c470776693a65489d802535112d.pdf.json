    "abstractText": "An essential step in bacterial transformation is the uptake of DNA into the periplasm, across the thick peptidoglycan cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria, or the outer membrane and thin peptidoglycan layer of Gram-negative bacteria. ComEA, a DNA-binding protein widely conserved in transformable bacteria, is required for this uptake step. Here we determine X-ray crystal structures of ComEA from two Gram-positive species, Bacillus subtilis and Geobacillus stearothermophilus, identifying a domain that is absent in Gram-negative bacteria. X-ray crystallographic, genetic, and analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) analyses reveal that this domain drives ComEA oligomerization, which we show is required for transformation. We use multiwavelength AUC (MW-AUC) to characterize the interaction between DNA and the ComEA DNA-binding domain. Finally, we present a model for the interaction of the ComEA DNA-binding domain with DNA, suggesting that ComEA oligomerization may provide a pulling force that drives DNA uptake across the thick cell walls of Gram-positive bacteria.",

Neiditch 1\nAn essential step in bacterial transformation is the uptake of DNA into the periplasm, across the thick peptidoglycan cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria, or the outer membrane and thin peptidoglycan layer of Gram-negative bacteria. ComEA, a DNA-binding protein widely conserved in transformable bacteria, is required for this uptake step. Here we determine X-ray crystal structures of ComEA from two Gram-positive species, Bacillus subtilis and Geobacillus stearothermophilus, identifying a domain that is absent in Gram-negative bacteria. X-ray crystallographic, genetic, and analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) analyses reveal that this domain drives ComEA oligomerization, which we show is required for transformation. We use multiwavelength AUC (MW-AUC) to characterize the interaction between DNA and the ComEA DNA-binding domain. Finally, we present a model for the interaction of the ComEA DNA-binding domain with DNA, suggesting that ComEA oligomerization may provide a pulling force that drives DNA uptake across the thick cell walls of Gram-positive bacteria.\nNatural competence for transformation is a mechanism of horizontal gene transfer widespread in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as well as in some archaea (for reviews see1,2). The transformation process consists of two major steps: uptake and transport (Fig. 1A). Uptake is themovement of environmental transforming DNA (tDNA) into the periplasm, across the thick peptidoglycan cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria or the outermembrane and thin peptidoglycan layer of Gram-negative bacteria. Transport is the subsequent translocation of single-stranded tDNA from the periplasm to the cytoplasm where it can recombine with the chromosome to generate a transformant. The structure-function studies presented here focus on the first step, DNA uptake. Uptake is initiated at the cell surface when tDNA interacts with a transformation pilus (tpilus). Following this contact with the tpilus, the movement of tDNA into the periplasm is driven by its interaction with the widely conserved periplasmic protein ComEA (Fig. 1A). ComEA, was discovered in genetic screens for transformation deficiency in Bacillus subtilis. It was subsequently shown to be a nonspecific DNA-binding protein required for both stable binding of tDNA to the cell and for tDNA uptake3,4.

This membrane anchor and a C-terminal DNA binding domain are separated by a region of unknown function consisting of ~110 amino acids (Fig. 1B). In sharp contrast, ComEA in the Gram-negatives contains only a single (stand-alone) DNA-binding domain which is free to diffuse in the periplasm5\u20137 (Fig. 1C).\nIn both Gram-negative and positive bacteria, except for Helicobacter pylori8, uptake is initiated by type 4 pili that bind DNA and retract, pulling a segment of transforming DNA into the periplasmic compartment9,10. It has been proposed that in the Gram-negative Vibrio cholerae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the single-domain ComEA then binds to this introduced tDNA segment, preventing loss of tDNA by backward diffusion across the outer membrane6,11. Thus, the pilus initiates uptake while ComEA operates as a Brownian ratchet12, providing the driving force for uptake of the bulk of the tDNA into the periplasm. In all bacteria, following uptake to the periplasm, one strand of tDNA is degraded and the remaining strand is transported to the cytoplasm through the ComECmembrane channel (reviewed in1,2). In Gram-positives, the membrane-associated ATPase ComFA and its partner protein ComFC, appear to provide the energy for transport. Equivalent Gram-negative proteins have not been identified.\nThe complex structure andmembrane anchoring of ComEA in the Gram-positives suggests that it may act differently than the simple Brownian ratchet mechanism proposed for V. cholerae and N. gonorrhoeae. To investigate this complex structure and to gain insight into its mode of action, we conducted an in vitro and in vivo structurefunction investigation, centered on the B. subtilis protein. Here we present X-ray crystal structures of ComEA from B. subtilis (ComEABs) and Geobacillus stearothermophilus (ComEAGs) together with complementary genetic and biophysical analyses. These studies reveal that the DNA binding domain is an atypical helix-hairpin-helix domain, and, most importantly, that a previously unidentified domain lies within the Gram-positive ComEA region of unknown function. We show that this\ndomain drives ComEA oligomerization, and that oligomerization is required for genetic transformation.Wepostulate that the unexpected role of ComEA oligomerization in DNA uptake is explained by DNAprotein condensation providing a driving force for tDNAuptake across the thick cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria."

No electron density was evident for the ComEABs DNA-binding domain or linker region, but there was clear density corresponding to a previously undescribed domain (amino acids 60\u2013122) (Fig. 2A). There are seven of these domains arranged head-to-tail in the ComEABs crystallographic asymmetric unit, and we named this region the oligomerization domain (OD) (Fig. 2A).\nIn contrast to ComEABs, in the ComEAGs structure there was interpretable electron density corresponding not only to the OD (amino acids 62\u2013124) but also to one DNA-binding domain (amino acids 143\u2013207) per asymmetric unit, which contained two OD protomers again arranged head-to-tail (Fig. 2B). Because there is no interpretable electron density corresponding to the ComEAGs linker region (amino acids 125\u2013142) of either protomer, it is unknown which of the ODmonomers in the asymmetric unit OD dimer connects to the single modeled DNA-binding domain. In fact, we could model the DNAbinding domain in the ComEAGs structure only because it made fortuitous crystal contacts. We conclude from the ComEA structures that the linker domain is flexible, that there are minimal contacts between theOD andDNA-binding domains, and that the ODs have the potential to form multimers in solution.\nWe note thatODmultimerization extends beyond the asymmetric unit (Fig. 2A, B).More specifically, in the ComEABs structure, the seven-\nuptake transport\ntpilus\nComGB\n(ComGC)\nComGA ComEA\nComEC\ncytoplasm\nperiplasm\ntDNA\nComGB\nComGA ComEA\nComEC ComGB\nComGA ComEA\nComEC\nA\nB\nC\n1 10 20530 142\nN CTM DNA Binding\nHhH1 HhH2 ComEABs (Gram-positive)\n103\nN C DNA Binding\nHhH1 HhH2 ComEAVc (Gram-negative)\n25 51\nFig. 1 | Existingmodel of genetic transformation inGram-positive bacteria, and ComEA domain architecture in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.

Similarly, in the ComEAGs structure, examination of symmetry mates reveals that the two-membered asymmetric unit uses the OD multimerization interface to form a kinked-ring spiral along the crystallographic screw axis, containing 12 head-to-tail protomers per turn (Fig. 3C, D). A slight tilt between ComEAGs protomers (Fig. S1) has minimal effects on the ComEA inter-dimer bonds, but it causes ComEAGs to form a kinked-ring rather than a closed ring within the crystals.\nComEA oligomerization interface amino acids are conserved (Fig. S2) andmediate conspicuous intermolecular interactions between the OD domains of ComEA protomers, e.g., the side chains of ComEAGs Arg85 and Asp113 (corresponding to ComEABs Arg83 and Asp111) which form intermolecular salt bridges, (Fig. 3E). This suggested that ComEA may oligomerize not only in the crystals but also in solution and we proceeded to explore this possibility."

            "text": "To confirm that the OD observed in both ComEA X-ray crystal structures mediated reversible self-association in solution, we analyzed different concentrations of ComEAGs using sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation (SV-AUC)13. At 10.3 \u03bcM, the majority of ComEAGs has a sedimentation coefficient of 1.6 S, consistent with the ComEAmonomer. However, at 157 \u03bcM, the majority of ComEAGs has a sedimentation coefficient of 2.2 S, suggesting reversible dimerization as a function ofmass action (Fig. 4A). At an intermediate concentration of 31.3 \u03bcMweobserved bothmonomer and dimer, and were able to fit the sedimentation velocity data to a discrete monomer-dimer equilibrium model13, resulting in a Kd of 33.8\u03bcM (95% confidence intervals: 19.3\u03bcM, 48.4\u03bcM) (Table S4). The apparent ComEA dimerization\naffinity is likely an underestimation of its in vivo dimerization affinity, because diffusion of ComEA in vivo is limited to two dimensions in the cell membrane.\nConsistent with the SV-AUC analysis of ComEAGs, a truncated ComEAGs protein consisting of the OD alone (ComEAGs-OD) also multimerized in solution (Fig. 4B). However, ComEAGs-OD formed primarily monomers and dimers at low concentration (12.7 \u03bcM) and larger oligomers with a maximummolar mass around 100 kDa at high concentration (196 \u03bcM) (Fig. S3). One possible kinetic explanation for the differentmultimeric states of ComEAGs andComEAGs-OD at similar concentrations is that the presence of the ComEAGs DNA-binding domain slows the OD multimerization search, limiting collisions, thus slowing the OD multimerization rate (kon).\nTo confirm that ComEA multimerization is driven by the OD, we examined the X-ray crystal structures to identify a small amino acid buried in theODmultimerization interface thatwe could replacewith a larger amino acid, introducing steric bulk and disrupting multimerization. We identified ComEAGs Ala108 (corresponding to ComEABs Ala106) and substituted it with tyrosine (Figs. 3E, 4A, C, and S4). Indeed, ComEAGs-A108Y was monomeric at both 11.3 \u03bcM and 124 \u03bcM (Fig. 4A). These SV-AUC experiments demonstrate that the OD drives ComEAmultimerization in solution as predicted from the X-ray crystal structures."

            "text": "We further speculated thatComEAmultimerization plays an important role in its interaction with DNA. To test this, we usedmulti-wavelength analytical ultracentrifugation (MW-AUC)14\u201317 to measure the binding of wild-type ComEAGs and ComEAGs-A108Y to DNA. MW-AUC is a novel technique that permits the spectral separation of protein and DNA species based on their unique absorbance spectra. Consequently, it is possible tomeasure themolar stoichiometry of the complexes formed and identify the type of macromolecule(s) forming each hydrodynamic species. The hydrodynamic measurements depend on each species\u2019 molar mass and hydrodynamic radius.\nTo elucidate the interactions between ComEA and doublestranded DNA, we mixed wild-type and mutant ComEA with a 14-bp double-stranded DNA duplex at a 5:1 and a 10:1 molar protein excess and a 10:1 protein excess over a 40-bp double-stranded DNA duplex (Fig. 5A\u2013C and Table S2). In all cases, the DNA concentration was held constant at 1.5\u03bcM, and a well-defined complex was formed, with less than 10% of the DNA remaining free in the solution. The deconvoluted DNA sedimentation pattern suggests the presence of a saturated, homogeneous complex being formed in all cases. As expected, theDNA sequestered excess protein until it was fully occupied, and the 14-bp sequence accommodated fewer ComEA molecules than the 40-bp sequence.\nThe sedimentation coefficient of the complex differed for wildtype and mutant and depended on the length of the DNA. The 14-bp double-stranded DNA duplex sedimented at 2.0 S in isolation but formeda 3.3 S complexwithComEAGs-A108Y, and a 3.9 S complexwith wild-type ComEAGs in the 5:1 mixture (Fig. 5A). For this mixture, we measured a ~3:1 protein:DNA ratio for the complex formed with ComEAGs, and a ~2:1 ratio for the complex formed with the ComEAGsA108Y protein. For the 10:1 protein:DNAmixture, a slightly larger 3.5 S complex was formed with ComEAGs-A108Y, a 4.0 S complex was formed with wild-type ComEAGs, and the protein:DNA ratios did not change significantly (Fig. 5B).\nThe 40-bp DNA sediments at 3.3 S when examined by itself, but, when mixed in a 10:1 ratio with ComEAGs-A108Y resulted in a 6.3 S complex, while the samemixturewith wild-type ComEAGs resulted in a 8.1 S complex (Fig. 5C). For the 40-bp DNA, the difference between protein:DNA molar ratios of the formed complexes was more pronounced between wild-type and mutant. The wild-type ComEAGs displayed an approximately 7:1 ratio, but the complex between DNA and\nNature Communications | (2022) 13:7724 3\nComEAGs-A108Y suggested the presence of about a 4.7:1 ratio. While the accuracyof these ratios dependson the estimatedmolarextinction coefficients in the formed complexes, there is a clear difference in the amount of ComEA bound to DNA for the wild-type and mutant proteins.\nIn sum, these results suggest that wild-type ComEA, capable of oligomerizing, forms larger complexes with DNA than the A108Y mutant. Oligomerization facilitates efficient and cooperative packing of ComEA on DNA, which is further supported by gel shift analysis (detailed below).\nComEA oligomerization is required for transformation The conservation in Gram-positive bacteria of both the ComEA OD domain itself and, significantly, the residues buried in the multimerization interface (Figs. S2 and 3E), led us to hypothesize that the OD is important for transformation. We measured this in vivo by comparing B. subtilis transformation in strains containing wildtype ComEABs; ComEABs-D111N, which disrupts a conserved intermolecular salt-bridge between D111 and R83 (corresponding to ComEAGs Asp113 and Arg85, Fig. 3E); ComEABs-A106Y (corresponding to ComEAGs-A108Y), which, as shown above, sterically blocks OD multimerization (Fig. 4A, C); and ComEA-\u0394OD, containing a deletion of the entire OD, while leaving intact both the transmembrane region and the DNA-binding domain. In comparison to wild-type ComEABs, ComEABs-D111N reduced B. subtilis transformation nearly 100-fold (Fig. 6A). Even more striking were the ComEABs-A106Y and ComEA-\u0394OD mutations that reduced B. subtilis transformation about 1,000-fold, a phenotype equivalent to that of a complete comEA deletion. Western blot analysis showed that the wild-type and mutant ComEA proteins were similarly expressed in B. subtilis (Fig. 6B). To determine whether the A106Y oligomerization deficient mutant exerts its effect on transformation by preventing DNA uptake to the periplasm, we used rhodamine-labeled tDNA, which can be taken up into the periplasm but cannot cross the cell membrane18. As shown in (Fig. 6C), the A106Y mutation prevents stable DNA association with competence-expressing cells, which we have shown previously required uptake to the periplasm18. We conclude that\nNature Communications | (2022) 13:7724 4\nComEA oligomerization plays an unexpected and necessary role in the transformation of B. subtilis and likely of other Gram-positive bacteria as well.\nComEA-DNA interactions are required for transformation The ComEAGs X-ray crystal structure revealed not only the structure of the OD, but the three-dimensional shape of the ComEA\nDNA-binding domain. As predicted from sequence analysis and noted previously6, the ComEA DNA-binding domain structure contains two helix-hairpin-helix (HhH) motifs (Figs. 1B and 7A). Structures of canonical HhH-containing proteins showed that pairs of HhH motifs are typically connected by an \u03b1-helix, and these five helices together are referred to as (HhH)2 domains\n19. This linker helix that connects the HhH motifs is conspicuously absent in ComEA, and its two HhHmotifs are instead connected by a loop (Fig. 7B). The ComEA DNA-binding domain is, therefore, an atypical HhH domain that forms a well-folded and compact DNAbinding core without the use of a connector helix.\nTo explore ComEA-DNA interaction, we used Dali20 and HADDOCK 2.421 to generate a ComEAGs-DNAmodel (Fig. 7B). In addition to numerous hydrogen bonds between protein backbone nitrogens and DNA phosphate groups, which is typically how HhH domains interact with DNA19,22, we observed that the sidechains of Lys166, Lys195, and Thr196 formedhydrogen bondswithDNAphosphate groups. To begin tounderstand the importanceofComEA sidechain interactions toDNA binding and ComEA function, wemutated some of the corresponding interfacial residues in ComEABs (e.g., ComEABs K164 and K193) to alanine and tested their effect on transformation in B. subtilis (Fig. 7C). Furthermore, in the absence of an experimentally-determined ComEADNA structure, we considered the possibility that the in silico model was incomplete. For example, the ComEA-DNA model does not show possible interactions between ComEA DNA-binding domains that might occur when oligomers of ComEA bind DNA. Thus, we mutated additional ComEABs residues K197 and K199 (equivalent to ComEAGs residues K199 and K201) to alanine and tested their effects on transformation in B. subtilis.\nComEABs mutants K164A, K193A, K197A, and K199A were individually expressed from the chromosome in B. subtilis and their effects on transformation were compared to that of wild-type ComEA (Fig. 7C).Western blot analysis showed thatwild-typeComEABs and the ComEABs proteins containing mutations in the HhH motifs were expressed to similar levels (Fig. 7D). These in vivo studies also showed that the K164A and K199A mutations caused more than a 2-log decrease in transformation (Fig. 7C), in contrast to the reproducible 2-4-fold effects of K193A and K197A.\nIn the ComEAGs-DNAmodel, residue K166 (equivalent to ComEABs K164) contacts DNA. Consistent with this observation and the ComEABs-K164 loss-of-function for transformation in vivo (Fig. 7C), purified ComEAGs-K166A (Fig. S4) does not bind DNA as determined using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) (Fig. 7E). In contrast, in the ComEAGs-DNA model, residue K201 (equivalent to ComEABs K199) does not contact DNA (Fig. 7B). ComEABs-K199A, however, displays a loss-of-function in vivo (Fig. 7C), and the purified equivalent ComEAGs-K201A (Fig. S4) displayed only about a 2-fold decrease in apparent DNA binding affinity in vitro (Fig. 7E).We suspect that ComEAGs residue K201 (ComEABs residue K199) may mediate interactions between ComEA molecules when they bind DNA or participate in DNA binding interactions not apparent in the ComEAGsDNA model.\nWhile additional structural studies will be required to flesh out the details of the ComEA-ComEA and ComEA-DNA intermolecular interactions within a ComEA-DNA complex, ComEABs K164\nFig. 4 | AUCanalysis ofComEA, ComEA-A108Y, and theComEAoligomerization domain.

Among all residues evaluated in our studies, ComEABs K164 is the most well-conserved throughout both the Gram-positives and Gram-negatives (Fig. 7A and S2). In fact, it is at least as well conserved in ComEA as the HhH motif signature residues. The equivalent V. cholerae residue, K63, was shown by the Blokesch lab to play an important role in that organism, and in silicomodeling suggested it may contact DNA6, as it appears to do in our study (Fig. 7B).\nFig. 5 | AUC analysis of ComEA and ComEA-A108Y, and their interactions with 1.5 \u03bcMDNA.

Here, the DNA signals still suggest full saturation with protein, but the protein signals show more heterogeneous sedimentation coefficient distributions, consistent with more rapid exchange with the protein-DNA complex, which suggests a faster koff rate.

The ComEA signal closely tracks the DNA signal, suggesting a tight complex formation with a slow koff rate.

            "text": "This study presents several notable findings. First, we have demonstrated the existence of a multimerization domain in ComEA from B. subtilis and G. stearothermophilus, also apparent in other multidomain ComEA proteins encoded by the Gram-positives (Figs. S2 and 8A). Our AUC results confirm that the oligomerization interface deduced from the crystal structure is important for ComEA dimerization and the existence of ring structures in crystals of bothComEABs and ComEAGs, as well as an SV-AUC experiment with the isolated OD, show that ComEA may form extended multimers in vivo (Fig. 3A\u2013D, Fig. 4B). As determined by MW-AUC, wild-type and ComEA-A108Y formDNA complexes with differentmolar ratios because DNA binding favors ComEA oligomerization by bringing the protein molecules into\nclose approximation, thus providing a cooperative effect. The EMSA results displayed in Fig. 6E provide further strong support for cooperative DNA binding. While it is tempting to speculate that ComEA multimerization in vivo generates rings like those observed in the crystal structures, there is no evidence for this.\nFinally, we have shown that both oligomerization and the DNA binding HhH motifs are needed for DNA uptake to the periplasm (Figs. 6 and 7).We have shown previously that ComEA plays important roles in B. subtilis4,18. Although the initial binding of tDNA to the transformable cell takes place to a surface exposed tpilus, this attachment is labile. When a loop of tDNA is pulled into the periplasm, presumably by disassembly of the tpilus filament9, the association of tDNA with the cell becomes stable as ComEAmediates DNA uptake to the periplasm18. In Neisseria gonorrheae and V. cholerae, the equivalent role of ComEA in uptake has been convincingly ascribed to a Brownian ratchet mechanism5,6,11,12,24, in which binding to DNA prevents retrograde diffusion. Now we have shown that although the DNA binding activity of ComEA is indeedneeded for transformation, consistentwith a simple ratchet, so is oligomerization, hinting at a more complex process than just the rectification of diffusion. An attractive and testable possibility is that simultaneous interaction of ComEA molecules with one another and with tDNA causes condensation of the DNAprotein complexes, providing a driving force for uptake (Fig. 8B). This\nA\nB\nC Wild-type\nA106Y\nFig. 6 | Self-association of ComEA is required for transformation.

The DNA binding and oligomerization domains are connected by flexible linkers of 20\u201325 residues and the OD is separated from the periplasmic membrane surface by another linker of about 60 residues (Fig. 8A). Thus, there are considerable degrees of freedom for the two domains within the periplasm. This mobility may be an important component of the proposed condensation mechanism, permitting adjacent ComEA molecules to contact one another through their ODs while contacting different segments of tDNA through their DNA-binding domains, thus effectively cross-linking and condensing the tDNA (Fig. 8B). We propose therefore, that ComEA in Gram-positive bacteria may not be simply a Brownian ratchet but may function as a force-generating protein for the uptake of tDNA.\nA comparison of the Gram-positive and Gram-negative ComEA molecules begs two questions: why has ComEABs evolved as a membrane protein while its single-domain orthologs are free to diffuse in the periplasm, and why do only the Gram-positive ComEA proteins contain an OD? The first question may be answered by the absence of an outer membrane in Gram-positives. Membrane anchoring will prevent the diffusion and loss of small proteins through the cell wall. Indeed, some ligand-binding proteins, e.g., those that bind amino acids for uptake, are diffusible in the periplasm of Gram-negative bacteria, but are membraneanchored in the Gram-positives27\u201329. The presence of an OD only in the Gram-positives may also reflect a difference in surface structure compared to the Gram-negatives. In Gram-negative bacteria, diffusion of the transforming DNA through the characteristically thin cell wall may be rapid enough for a Brownian ratchet to effect efficient entry to the periplasm. But contacts of transforming DNA with the necessary channel in the thick peptidoglycan of Grampositives, may provide a frictional impediment to diffusion, requiring additional pulling force. This intuitive concept is supported by a study showing that the rate of diffusion through a channel is reduced as the channel is made longer30."

Sedimentation and diffusion transport in the ultracentrifugation cell are described by the Lamm equation, which is solved using adaptive finite element methods38,39. Whole boundary data obtained in SV experiments are fitted by linear combinations of such solutions using advanced optimization routines40\u201342 that are computationally intensive and are carried out on high-performance computing platforms43. SVEs were performed in a Beckman Coulter Optima AUC at the Canadian Center for Hydrodynamics at the University of Lethbridge. Data were collected using single- or multiwavelength UV detection. 0.45ml of sample was filled into doublesector epon-charcoal centerpieces equipped with sapphire windows and measured in intensity mode. All experiments were performed at 20 \u00b0C, and in a buffer containing 10mM Tris [pH 8], 100mM KCl. ComEAGs-OD was measured at 37 krpm. ComEAGs and DNA were measured at 60 krpm. MW-AUC data involving the 14-bp DNA sequenceweremeasured at 55 krpm,whileMW-AUCdata involving the 40-bp DNA sequence were collected at 43 krpm. MW-AUC data were recorded in the range of 235\u2013285 nm with 2 nm increments, providing 26 individual datasets for each sample. All data were analyzed using UltraScan 4.044. The processing of MW-AUC data is described in detailed inHenrickson et al., 202214. Briefly, data fromeachwavelength were analysed using the two-dimensional spectrum analysis (2DSA)40, following the workflow described in45. After generating timesynchronous SVEs, the hydrodynamic profile is spectrally deconvoluted into themolar extinction coefficient profiles of protein andDNA. Buffer density and viscosity correctionswere calculatedwithUltraScan using the partial concentration of each buffer component. Molar extinction profiles were determined by performing separate dilution series for each protein and DNA, collecting an absorbance spectrum across the spectral range of interest (220\u2013300nm) using a Genesys 10 s benchtop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The dilution series of each absorbance spectrum was fitted to an intrinsic extinction profiles as described previously44. The resulting intrinsic extinction profiles were scaled to molar concentration using an extinctioncoefficient of 7,450M-1 cm-1 at 280nm forComEAGs-A108Y and 5,960M-1 cm-1 at 280 nm for ComEAGs (as estimated by UltraScan from protein sequence). Diffusion-corrected sedimentaton coefficient profiles were generated using the enhanced van Holde \u2013 Weischet analysis implemented in UltraScan46. Van Holde \u2013Weischet results are shown as G(s) integral distribution plots, which display the integrated concentration of a sedimenting species on the y axis.

Cultures for thepreparationof extractsweregrown to competence andgrowthwas monitored in a Klett colorimeter. After collection by centrifugation, cellswere resuspended in slightly different volumes to compensate for minor differences in turbidity, ensuring that equivalent total protein was loaded in each lane. Because the strains all carried an ectopic gene encoding unfused YFP, an internal loading control was present in every lane."

The ComEAGs DNA-binding domain was aligned to XPF to generate the starting model of the ComEAGs DNA-binding domain in complex with 15 bp of DNA. This model was refined in HADDOCK 2.4 using the flexible refinement in explicit solvent approach21.\nElectrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described previously with slight modification6. Briefly, ComEAGs at the indicated concentrations and 0.5 \u03bcM 30 bp DNA were mixed in buffer containing 10mM Tris [pH 8], 100mM KCl, 2.5% glycerol, 0.5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and 1 mM MgCl2 at room temperature for 15 min. Subsequently, 0.5 volumes of loading dye containing bromophenol blue and 2.5% glycerol was added to the samples. The samples were then immediately loaded on an 8% native polyacrylamide gel prerun at 4 \u00b0C in 0.5X TBE buffer. The gels were stained with ethidium bromide and scanned using a BioRad ChemiDoc MP imager."
