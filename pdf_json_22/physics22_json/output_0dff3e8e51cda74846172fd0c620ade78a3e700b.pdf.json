    "abstractText": "The two-field vibroacoustic finite-element (FE) model requires a relatively large number of degrees of freedom compared to the monophysics model, and the conventional force identification method for structural vibration can be adjusted for multiphysics problems. In this study, an effective inverse force identification method for an FE vibroacoustic interaction model of an interior fluid-structure system was proposed. The method consists of: (1) implicit inverse force identification based on the Newmark-\u03b2 time integration algorithm for stability and efficiency, (2) secondorder ordinary differential formulation by avoiding the state-space form causing large degrees of freedom, (3) projection-based multiphysics reduced-order modeling for further reduction of degrees of freedom, and (4) Tikhonov regularization to alleviate the measurement noise. The proposed method can accurately identify the unmeasured applied forces on the in situ application and concurrently reconstruct the response fields. The accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency of the proposed method were evaluated using numerical models and an experimental testbed. A comparative study with the augmented Kalman filter method was performed to evaluate its relative performance.",

            "text": "The structural dynamics of liquid fluids subjected to vibration and/or transient excitations (e.g., launcher payloads, nuclear power plants, tanker ships, and automobiles) are important for aerospace engineering, nuclear engineering, civil engineering, mechanical engineering, and naval architecture. Various analytical (and semi-analytical) methods have been proposed to describe the dominant features of fluid-filled tankers by combining the structural mode shapes and acoustic fluid potential [1, 2, 3, 4]. Finite-element (FE) modeling is one of the most popular numerical\n\u2217Corresponding authors\nEmail address: jingyun.kim@khu.ac.kr ( Jin-Gyun Kim )\nPreprint submitted to Arxiv November 23, 2022\nmethods to design and analyze the interior fluid-structure interaction problem of modern structures with complex geometries [5]. The two-field coupled FE model is defined as a discretized second-order ordinary differential equation, and the system matrices (mass, stiffness, and damping) defined numerically are adjusted by conventional FE model updating techniques with experimentally measured data such as natural frequencies, damping ratios, and a frequency response function [6, 7, 8, 9].\nForce identification is also a primary process for achieving a precise FE model. However, in practice, direct measurement of the applied forces is difficult or impossible owing to various limitations. Therefore, inverse force identification methods have been studied to overcome this issue in terms of structural dynamics and vibration. Law et al. [10] proposed the time domain force identification method using explicit integration method to identify the moving forces. Zhu and Law implemented a method for multi-span bridges to identify moving forces[11, 12]. In addition, Law and Fang proposed a state-space-representation-based identification method [13] using a dynamic programming technique. Later, Kammer proposed an inverse force identification method based on a set of inverse Markov parameters [14], and Law et al. also used a Markov parameter system to identify time-varying wind loads. [15]. The Kalman filter technique is also implemented in inverse force identification methods to restrain the effect of inherent noise in the measured signal. Lourens et al. proposed a structural force identification method using the augmented Kalman filter (AKF) algorithm[16], and Naets et al. suggested a stable force identification process by adding dummy measurements at the position level[17]. Azam et al. implemented the dual Kalman filter concept to prevent numerical issues attributed to the unobservability and rank deficiency of input signals[18]. Recently, Kalman-filter-based methods have been extended to nonlinear systems by implementing an unscented Kalman filtering algorithm on the structural systems[19]. These Kalman-filter-based methods are also based on the state-space representation of the numerical model and explicit timeintegration methods.\nThese methods can successfully identify the unknown applied forces of the structural dynamics and vibration systems in the time domain. The problem is that inverse force identification has rarely been studied for the FE-based vibroacoustic interaction model of structural vibration containing interior liquid fluid, and conventional force identification methods can be adjusted based on the following aspects. (1) In structural vibration, the fluid domain idealized as a linear acoustic fluid is discretized using fluid pressure, velocity potentials, displacement potentials, etc., which implies that the number of fluid degrees of freedom (DOFs) is added to the empty tanker structure model. Therefore, the computational cost issue with conventional inverse force identification is severe in multiphysics problems. (2) Most existing time-domain force identification methods are based on the state-space form. It would be resolved with a reduced order modeling in linear structural vibration [20, 21, 22], but the state-space form with the virbo-acoustic multiphysics model reduction is another difficulty [5, 23, 24, 25]. This can be resolved by reduced-order modeling in linear structural vibration, but the state-space form with vibro-acoustic multiphysics model reduction is another difficulty. (3) Explicit algorithms and Kalman filtering within the state-space form have been successfully and widely used for inverse force identification [16, 18, 17]. This is sufficient for rigid-body system dynamics and a simplified structural dynamics model with relatively low dominant natural frequencies, such as high-rise towers, multistorey buildings, bridges, frames, and truss structures. However, the disadvantages of a large discretization error with a low sampling\nfrequency or a long sampling duration are well known; hence, Liu et al. proposed an explicit form of an implicit formulation for inverse force identification in structural dynamics[26]. The Tikhonov regularization method was then employed to cancel the noise within the Newmark-\u03b2 algorithm instead of the Kalman filter. (4) Several researchers have addressed inverse force identification for vibroacoustic systems [27, 28, 29]. . However, these were based on frequency-domain-based approaches and were only studied for noise source identification for NVH problems, such as cabin noise and room noise. This study was motivated by these aspects.\nThe aim of this study is to develop an efficient inverse force identification method for the structural dynamics of a liquid fluid subjected to vibration and/or transient excitations. The proposed inverse force identification method is based on the time-domain approach, which is capable of indirectly identifying the excitation forces using a limited amount of sensing information such as displacement and acceleration. It is then derived from the Newmark-\u03b2 time-integration algorithm in an implicit manner to achieve an unconditionally stable condition and computational efficiency with a relatively large time step. The second-order ordinary differential formulation is directly used instead of the state-space form to avoid an increasing number of DOFs of the vibroacoustic formulation. In this work, the well known displacement (u)-pressure (p) formulation is considered to describe the interaction between the elastic structure and acoustic liquid fluid. The Tikhonov regularization technique[30, 31] is then implemented to alleviate the measurement noise and control the ill-posedness of the numerical process within the Newmark-\u03b2 method. We also pursue an accurate and efficient reconstruction of the unmeasured response data (displacement, stress, strain, pressure, etc.) in the entire domain as well as the applied force identification. Projectionbased multiphysics reduced-order modeling is then employed in the proposed force identification method [23, 24]. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using numerical examples of an h-shaped pipe structure containing a liquid fluid. A numerical test is designed to investigate simple sinusoidal and random loads with different noise levels. Some measured response information is used to identify the unmeasured forces. Comparison studies of both accuracy and efficiency are performed using the AKF method [16]. For the experimental study, a test bed is set up with an L-shaped pipeline filled with liquid water. For the experimental test, a single-point displacement signal is used as the source displacement for the proposed inverse force identification process. The accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency of the proposed method are then evaluated by comparing the identified results with reference quantities.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In Section. 2, a general description of the inverse dynamic problem, the vibroacoustic reduced-order modeling, and the proposed implicit inverse force identification process is presented. The detailed numerical test conditions and results are discussed in Section. 3, The experimental test conditions and results are described in Section. 4. The conclusions are presented in Section. 5."

The force identification process can be defined as a minimization problem for determining the proper force values that can cause the measured physical responses of the\ntarget systems. Furthermore, the implied measurement errors in the measured physical quantities can significantly pollute the identified results owing to the ill-posedness of the inverse problem. Tikhonov regularization [30, 31] is a widely used regularization method to solve such types of inverse dynamics problems. In this method, considering the measurement errors of the measured quantities, the following damped least-squares error equation can be defined:\nJ(f, \u03b1) = \u2016zm \u2212 zn\u20162 + \u03b1 \u2016f\u20162 , (1)\nwhere J is the damped least-squares error and \u03b1 is the regularization parameter. The stability and accuracy of the regularized solution can be controlled by changing the parameter \u03b1, which can be obtained using various parameter estimation algorithms such as the L-curve method[32]. z is the input response vector, and subscripts m and n denote the measured and numerically predicted values, respectively. f is an unknown applied force vector. In practice, the system response can only be measured at a few points. Hence, the response information from the measurement point can be selected from the numerical prediction values using the following relationship:\nt+\u2206tzn =\n          Sd 0 0 0 Sv 0\n0 0 Sa\n                    d d\u0307\nd\u0308\n          , (2)\nwhere S is the selection matrix for choosing the measured response vector of the numerical model, and the subscripts d, v, and a denote the selection matrices for response vector and its first and second derivatives (Sd \u2208 Rnzd\u00d7nd , Sv \u2208 Rnzv\u00d7nvSa \u2208 Rnza\u00d7na). The selection matrices can be constructed in the form of a boolean matrix that specifies the locations of the applied force elements. To define the response vectors (d, d\u0307, d\u0308) of the system, an appropriate numerical model should be constructed. In this study, the FE model is used to describe the multiphysical properties of vibroacoustic systems. The (u, p) formulation is a classical method of generating an FE model of vibroacoustic systems. In the formulation, mechanical properties of both displacement (u) and pressure (p) fields of the vibroacoustic system can be described while considering their coupling effects. The undamped (u, p) formulation of the vibroacoustic system could be defined by the following equations of the motion:\nAd\u0308 + Bd = S f f, (3a)\nA =\n[\nMs 0\n\u03c1 f c2CT M f\n]\n, B =\n[\nKs \u2212C 0 K f\n]\n, d =\n[\nu p\n]\n, S f f =\n[\nf s f f\n]\n, (3b)\nwhere matrices A, B, and C are the mass, stiffness, and coupling matrices of the vibroacoustic system, respectively. \u03c1 f and c are the density and speed of sound values of the system, respectively. S f is the selection matrix of the force vector that connects the applied force elements to the equations of motion of the target system (S f \u2208 Rnd\u00d7n f ). The superscripts s and f denote the structure and fluid components of the system, respectively."

The domain transformation of the response vectors can be expressed as\nt+\u2206td = T\u0302t+\u2206td\u0302, t+\u2206td\u0307 = T\u0302t+\u2206t \u02d9\u0302d, t+\u2206td\u0308 = T\u0302t+\u2206t \u00a8\u0302d.

This enables the precise real-time identification of multiple responses for the entire target structure domain, including displacements, accelerations, strains, fluid pressure, and any other responses that can be computed by conventional FE dynamic analysis.

Table 3 presents the computed error factors for the identified displacement signals.\nAll error measures of the identified displacement signals are computed as values smaller than 0.079. Hence, the identified displacement results accurately describe the trend of the reference displacement signals.\nThe computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm is also evaluated by comparing the required computation time with the actual pre-computed numerical test duration. The required computation time for the numerical test is 0.324939 sec for 10 sec of reference signals. According to the efficiency test results, the process can be implemented on the test structure even in real time under the intended sample rates. The results demonstrate that the proposed identification process can be implemented in practical applications."

To test the stability of the force identification process under highly noisy conditions,\nthe accuracy of the identified forces is evaluated under various noise levels.

The noise rate coefficient \u03c4 is varied from 0 % to 5 % (\u03c4 = 0.00 to 0.05) in six increments. Each test case is performed 20 times iteratively, and three error coefficients are computed and averaged for all cases. The unknown applied forces are identified and their accuracy is evaluated. A single point of the identified force results (f1x ) is considered in the study, and the computed error levels of the remaining identified force results are observed to be similar to the represented results. The identified results are depicted in Fig 6. The computed error measures of the identified force data are also depicted in Fig 7.\nAs shown in the figures, the identification errors gradually increase with the magnitude of the error.

The test is performed in the same system and conditions as in the previous numerical tests, and the results obtained from the proposed and AKF[16] methods are compared to the real applied force values. The time increments of the methods are set to different values by considering their numerical properties. In the case of the proposed method, the Newmark-\u03b2 time-integration algorithm employed is unconditionally stable. Hence, the proposed method can be performed with relatively large time increment values. In this study, the time increment for the proposed method is set to 1E-04 sec. Otherwise, the solution to the AKF method is conditionally stable. Hence, sufficiently small time increments are required to implement the method. Therefore, various time increment values (from 2e-07 to 2E-08 sec) are tested for the AKF algorithm to check its convergence and relative accuracy. For all the test cases, 0.1 sec of identified force results and their required computation times are collected. The noise rate coefficient is set to 1 % (\u03c4 = 0.01) for all cases. In the original paper on the AKF method, the problem only considered monophysical structural systems without a reduced-order modeling process. Hence, the formulations of the method are modified by applying the strongly coupled vibroacoustic reduced-order modeling technique for equivalent comparison. A detailed derivation of the modified formulations can be found in Appendix B. Figure. 8 shows the first 0.005 sec of identified force results of the comparative study cases.\nThe results reveal that the proposed algorithm can accurately identify unknown applied forces even with relatively large time increment values compared to the AKF method. Figure. 9 shows the comprehensive error values of force element f1x for each case.\nThe computed comprehensive errors of the results from the AKF method cases decreased by reducing the size of the time increment. Meanwhile, the proposed method with a time increment of 1E-04 sec could give more accurate results than the results from the AKF with a time increment of 2E-08 sec. The required computation time for the test is listed in Table. 4.\nThe required computation time for the proposed method is less than that of the AKF method.

A vibroacoustic FE model of the structure is generated, and the proposed identification algorithm is then implemented on a PC. An experimental evaluation is performed by comparing the identified results with the experimentally measured quantities. In addition, the computational efficiency is evaluated at the end of this section.\nThe target structure of the testbed is a simple pipeline with an elbow component bent at 90\u25e6 in the middle of the structure. The pipe system is then fixed to a rigid fixture at both ends. The length of each straight section is 1m, and the diameters of the outer and inner sides of the pipeline are 27.2 mm and 23.9 mm, respectively. The entire target pipe structure is made of AISI 304 stainless steel and filled with water.\nFor the experimental study, the displacement is measured at two separate points. The first point is the source displacement, which is used as the measured displacement signal for the force identification process and is measured at the same point where the external force is applied. A laser displacement sensor (LK-G30, KEYENCE) is used to measure the source displacement signal of the structure. An additional laser displacement sensor (LK-G150) is mounted in the middle of the straight section of the structure and is used as the reference displacement signal to evaluate the identified result. Meanwhile, an external force is applied to the structure through a modal shaker (ET-139, LabWorks) on the top of the elbow component. The excitation signal is generated using a function generator (33500B, Keysight) and amplified using a signal amplifier (PA-138, LabWorks). The applied force is measured using a load cell (UMM 5 kgf, DACELL). Figure. 10 shows the constructed experimental testbed and the detailed geometry of the constructed target structure.\nThe vibroacoustic FE model of the structure is generated in the same shape as the target structure using hexahedral elements. A total of 18 560 and 14 400 elements are used for the fluid and structure parts, respectively. Figure. 11 shows the FE model generated for the target structure.\nThe Young\u2019s modulus E and density of the structure \u03c1s are 200 GPa and 8E-09 t/mm3 respectively, and the speed of sound in water c and the density of the fluid \u03c1 f are 1480 m/sec and 1.01E-09 t/mm3, respectively. The Poisson ratio of the structural part is 0.3. The material properties used are pre-calibrated values updated using conventional FE model updating techniques[7, 6, 8, 9].\nThe generated FE model is then reduced to an efficient form using the strongly coupled vibroacoustic reduced-order modeling technique. The modes used for the reduction process are 30 for the structural part (N s d ) and 30 for the fluid part (N f d ) of the full model. Hence, the total DOF counts of the model is reduced from 79212 DOFs to 60 DOFs after reduction. Figure 12 shows the relative eigenvalue errors between the original and reduced models."

The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method are evaluated on both numerical and experimental test beds, and the results show good agreement with reference force information. The displacement response of the structure and the identified forces are also well predicted in the proposed process. The required identification duration of the proposed method is measured while performing the evaluation test and compared with the actual duration of the experiment, which implies that in situ real-time force identification and response reconstruction of the vibroacoustic structure are possible with the proposed method. In particular, from a computational perspective, the proposed method has comparative robustness and computational efficiency compared to the AKF approach in the vibroacoustic problems considered in this work.\nOnly the vibroacoustic (u-p) formulation of certain tanker and/or pipe structures with fully filled liquid fluid is considered here, but the proposed inverse force identification method is not limited. The proposed force identification method can also be employed for a tanker with a free surface that has a similar (u-p) formulation [36, 5], and it can be derived from different vibroacoustic formulations, such as displacement (u) - potential (\u03c6) and displacement (u) - pressure (p) - potential (\u03c6) forms [5, 24]. The strongly coupled multiphysics model reduction method [23, 24] is employed here, but various projection-based model reduction techniques (such as proper orthogonal decomposition modes, coupled modes, and Krylov bases) can be directly employed in the proposed formulation. Finally, this work could be used for the development of real-time monitoring systems and model-driven digital twins for vibroacoustic engineering problems. However, the fluid domain and fluid-induced vibration have received less attention here, and this work does\nnot cover nonlinear responses such as geometrical nonlinearity, the sloshing effect, free surface tension, and prestressed structures. These challenges will be investigated in the future.\nAcknowledgements\nThis research was funded by National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2020M2C9A1062790\nand NRF-2021R1A2C4087079)."
