    "abstractText": "The facet-dependent adsorption of CO on oxidized and reduced CeO2 single crystal surfaces is reviewed, with emphasis on the effect of CO coverage and the ability of state-of-the-art quantum-mechanical methods to provide reliable energies and an accurate description of the IR vibrational frequency of CO. Comparison with detailed, high-resolution experimental infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy data obtained for single crystal samples allows the assignment of the different CO vibrational bands observed on all three low-index ceria surfaces. Good agreement is achieved with the hybrid density functional theory approach with the HSE06 functional and with saturation coverage. It is shown that CO is very sensitive to the structure of cerium oxide surfaces and to the presence of oxygen vacancies. The combined theoreticalexperimental approach offers new opportunities for a better characterization of ceria nanoparticles and for unraveling changes occurring during reactions involving CO at higher pressures. \u00a9 2023 Author(s).

INTRODUCTION\nCerium dioxide (CeO2 or ceria) is an important material in heterogeneous catalysis that has been used either as a catalyst or as a support material.1 In addition, this rare-earth metal oxide has found applications in a number of other fields including solid-oxide fuel cells and even biology.2,3 Powder ceria materials, the most important form for technological applications, consist of nanometer- or micrometer-sized particles that expose facets with different crystallographic orientations. The different surfaces have rather different structures (see Fig. 1), and, as a result, exhibit different chemical activities. This fact has been concluded from several careful studies of chemical reactions carried out with ceria nanocrystals of\ndifferent morphologies, such as nanooctahedra (mostly exhibiting {111}-facets), nanocubes (mostly exhibiting {100}-facets), as well as nanorods (mostly exhibiting {110}- and {100}-facets).4\u20139\nIn order to rationalize the chemical activities of oxide powders in general and ceria nanoparticles in particular, reliable, easy-to-use methods are required to determine the nature of the exposed facets. In addition, it is important to note that the surfaces of the nanoparticles are not static; under reaction conditions (high pressure and elevated temperatures), the facets can undergo restructuring.10\u201314\nWhen the particles are exposed to reducing conditions, this restructuring may include the creation of oxygen vacancies, the ease of which is strongly facet-dependent.15 Therefore, in order to get detailed insight into the mechanisms driving chemical reactions on\nJ.

This color code is used in all subsequent figures.\npure and metal-decorated ceria nanocrystals, it is mandatory to have available experimental methods capable of probing the surfaces of ceria-based catalysts under static and operando conditions with sufficient sensitivity to distinguish the different surface orientations and to provide information on the presence of oxygen vacancies. Among the existing experimental methods, the use of probe molecules like CO in connection with infrared (IR) vibrational spectroscopy, for example, in the surface-ligand IR (SLIR) approach,16 has been particularly successful. Carbon monoxide, or CO, is a popular probe molecule in the context of the SLIR approach. For numerous oxides [TiO2 (anatase and rutile), Fe2O3, Fe3O4, ZnO, and CeO2],17 it has been demonstrated that this probe molecule is very sensitive to the structure of oxide surfaces and can also be used to detect oxygen vacancies.18,19 In the case of ceria, numerous studies have been reported in the past for ceria powder samples exposed to CO.16,20\u201326\nHowever, there is no general consensus on the assignment of the different CO vibrational bands. For example, the band at about 2154 cm\u22121 has been attributed to several different species such as physisorbed CO weakly bound to surface hydroxyl groups22 or CO adsorbed at under-coordinated Ce4+ ions in the vicinity of O vacancies.21,26 In view of these rather divergent assignments of experimental stretch frequencies, reliable reference data for CO adsorbed on model systems are required. Since even for well-defined model systems, i.e., single-crystal surfaces with low defect densities, ambiguities often exist in the assignment of vibrational features, a consistent theoretical description is also required. For example, even if there is only one possible adsorption site, different CO adsorbate species with varied tilt angles might exist (see below). In addition, it is important to know what the effect of oxygen vacancies is on the adsorbate frequencies. This information is a necessary condition for the characterization of the technologically relevant powder materials, which need to be characterized under reaction conditions. The interpretation of IR data acquired under operando conditions at higher pressures and elevated temperatures for ceria powders inside reaction chambers requires such reference data together with a reliable assignment obtained from ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations.\nIn the past, the application of theoretical methods, most of them employing density functional theory (DFT) with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for exchange and correlation,\nFIG. 2.

These problems are in part due to the rather weak interaction of this small di-atomic molecule with oxide surfaces but also to inherent problems in describing the electronic structure of CO with DFT-GGA methods, e.g., the HOMO\u2013LUMO gap of CO is \u223c30% small when using such a standard method.28 In a recent paper,29 we have demonstrated that in the case of the oxidized (111)- and (110)-surfaces of ceria, the DFT-GGA problems in accurately describing vibrational\nJ.

The theoretical results are analyzed based on the comprehensive IRRAS (infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy) data of CO adsorbed on all three oxidized and reduced ceria single-crystal surfaces.12,31\u201333 In order to validate the importance of using the computationally rather expensive HSE06 functional to describe the CO-ceria interaction, we will, in all cases, compare the HSE06 results with those previously obtained using the standard PBE+U functional.\nThe paper is organized as follows. We will first discuss the theoretical results for the two nonpolar oxidized and reduced ceria (111) and (110) surfaces for two different CO coverages and compare them to the available experimental data. In the next step, we will consider the polar, reconstructed CeO2(100) surface, where the surface O atoms are removed in a checkerboard style, and demonstrate that with the HSE06 functional, a good agreement between experimental and theoretical data is also achieved for this surface.

            "text": "Spin-polarized DFT calculations were carried out using the slab-supercell approach34 with the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP, http://www.vasp.at; version 5.4.4).35,36 We treated the Ce (4f, 5s, 5p, 5d, 6s) and O (2s, 2p) electrons as valence states within the projector augmented wave (PAW) method with a planewave cutoff energy of 500 eV, whereas the remaining electrons were considered as part of the atomic cores. Strong correlation effects due to charge localization were considered by either adding a Hubbard U-like term37 (referred to simply as U) for the Ce 4f states (U = 4.5 eV)38,39 to the Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functional40 or by using the hybrid-DFT HSE06 functional,30,41\u201345 which increases substantially the computational cost of plane-wave calculations. We note that dispersion forces are involved in adsorbate-surface interactions.46,47 In a previous study,29 the effect of long-range dispersion corrections together with PBE+U and HSE06 was tested, and no significant effect was observed on either the calculated change in the C\u2013O bond length upon adsorption or on the calculated frequency shift, \u0394\u03bd, although they did result in an increase in the bonding strength of CO to the ceria surface of \u2a850.2 eV. Hence, in this work, dispersion corrections were not included in the calculations.\nBulk ceria has a cubic fluorite structure (Fm3m) with a calculated lattice constant of 5.485 \u00c5 (PBE+U) or 5.398 \u00c5 (HSE06). The low-index CeO2 (111), (110), and (100) facets were modeled employing slab models with surface unit cells of two different sizes, namely, (1 \u00d7 1) and (2 \u00d7 2), (1 \u00d7 1) and (2 \u00d7 2), and (1 \u00d7 1) and p(2 \u00d7 2) periodicities, respectively (see Figs. 1 and S1), with the corresponding DFT-optimized lattice parameter; the number of layers used in each slab model is described in Table S1. The Monkhorst\u2013Pack method48 has been used to sample the Brillouin zones, and the k-meshes used for each structure are also included in Table S1. All supercells were set with a vacuum space of at least 15 \u00c5.\nJ. Chem. Phys. 159, 034704 (2023); doi: 10.1063/5.0153745 159, 034704-3\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2023\n12 January 2024 17:35:33\nThe bulk-truncated oxygen-terminated (100) surface is polar, and thus surface reconstructions are expected. Different surface terminations with either Ce or O atoms in the outermost layer have been proposed in studies employing theoretical and experimental approaches.49\u201351 We here considered the checkerboard (100)\u2212O termination (4O\u20134Ce\u20138O\u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c54Ce\u20134O), in which 50% of the oxygen atoms in the bulk-truncated surface oxygen layer have been removed and placed at the bottom of the slab. This termination is 0.32 J/m2 more stable than the corresponding (100)\u2212Ce terminated one (2Ce\u20138O\u20134Ce\u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c58O\u20132Ce).15 It should be mentioned that a mixture of O- and Ce-terminations can reduce the surface energy. For instance, the calculated surface energy for an 87.5%/12.5% [(100)\u2212O]/(100)\u2212Ce] mixed termination [c(2 \u00d7 2) unit cell] is by 0.03 J/m2 smaller than that of the pure (100)\u2212O termination, in agreement with what was observed by Pan et al.49 We will not consider such mixed terminations of the (100) facet in more detail because it is beyond the scope of this work and only discuss the (100)\u2212O, hereinafter referred to as (100).15,49\u201351\nAll atoms in the bottom atomic layers were fixed, as indicated in Table S1, at their optimized bulk-truncated positions during geometry optimization, whereas the rest of the atoms were allowed to fully relax. Total energies and forces were calculated with a precision of 10\u22128 eV and 10\u22122 eV/\u00c5 for electronic and force convergence, respectively, for geometry optimization and the calculation of vibrational frequencies. When describing the outcome of the theoretical work and the experimental results, we will use the term \u201coxidized surface\u201d to describe the results of the theoretical work carried out for a surface with an ideal CeO2 stoichiometry. In the case of the experimental work, the term \u201coxidized surface\u201d describes experimental results for a surface that has been oxidized using, for example, exposure to oxygen gas at elevated temperatures. In the latter case, however, a small concentration of oxygen vacancies cannot be excluded. The experimental preparation of a fully stoichiometric, ideal oxide surface is virtually impossible. The term \u201creduced surface\u201d is used to describe the experimental results for a surface that has been reduced, for example, by annealing in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions at high temperatures. There are a remarkable number of oxygen vacancies on the reduced surface.\nThe reduced surfaces were modeled by removing a surface oxygen atom from the slabs with the larger surface unit cell. The localization of the excess charge corresponds to that of the most stable structure, as previously reported.15 For the cases of the (111) and (100) surfaces, the presence of subsurface oxygen vacancies has also been considered.\nThe adsorption energy per CO molecule on the CeO2 surfaces was calculated according to the following equation: Eads = (E[n \u22c5CO/CeO2] \u2212 E[CeO2] \u2212 n \u22c5 E[COgas])/n, where E[CO/CeO2] is the total energy of n CO molecules adsorbed on the surface, E[CeO2] is the total energy of the surface without the adsorbate, and E[COgas] is the energy of the CO molecule in the gas phase.\nThe vibrational modes of adsorbed CO were calculated from a finite difference approximation of the dynamical matrix with 0.015 \u00c5 for the displacements as implemented in the VASP code, and the IR intensities from a finite difference approximation of the gradient of the z component of the dynamic dipole moment.52 Only the adsorbed CO was considered for the vibrational analysis. To simulate the vibrational spectrum, a summation of Gaussian\nfunctions with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 10 cm\u22121 was employed. CO in the gas phase was modeled using a single molecule in a cubic unit cell (8 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 8) \u00c53, sampled with the \u0393-point. The computed CO stretching vibrational frequency for adsorbed CO on the ceria surfaces was scaled by the method-dependent factor \u03bb = vexpCOgas/v calc COgas with v exp COgas = 2143 cm\n\u2212115 and vcalcCOgas = 2127 and 2235 cm\u22121 for PBE+U and HSE06, respectively. The calculated C\u2013O bond length of CO in the gas phase is 114.34 and 113.15 pm with PBE+U and HSE06, respectively.26"

Finally, CO adsorbed on the oxidized (100) surface reveals an intense band at 2176 cm\u22121 with a shoulder at 2168 cm\u22121 and a second weaker peak at 2147 cm\u22121. Upon further reducing the surface by annealing to 800 K under UHV conditions, a shift of the main band from 2176 to 2168 cm\u22121 is observed, whereas the frequency of the low-lying band remains unchanged at 2147 cm\u22121 [Fig. 2(a)].\nIn the corresponding s-polarized IRRAS data [Fig. 2(b)], only a weak CO feature is resolved for the ceria (111) surface, while the CO vibrational signals are invisible for the (110) and (100) surfaces.

An adsorption site for CO atop Ce4+ is found, with the CO binding nearly perpendicular to the surface. At the (111) surface, there is only one type of Ce4+ ion exposed, which is 7-fold coordinated. At low CO coverage, the CO stretching frequency, \u03bd, calculated with HSE06 shows a larger blue shift (+18 cm\u22121) than that calculated with the PBE+U approach (+2 cm\u22121). Similar results are obtained at full CO coverage with \u0394\u03bd =+14 and+1 cm\u22121 with HSE06 and PBE+U, respectively (Figs. 3 and S2). Furthermore, we note that the calculated adsorption energies become significantly lower with increasing CO coverage, from \u22120.18 eV for PBE+U and \u22120.13 eV\nJ. Chem. Phys. 159, 034704 (2023); doi: 10.1063/5.0153745 159, 034704-5\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2023\nfor HSE06 at \u03b8 = 1/4 to \u22120.03 eV and \u22120.09 eV, respectively, at \u03b8 = 1 (Fig. S2).\nThe calculated results with PBE+U and HSE06 for CO adsorption on the oxidized CeO2(111) surface are summarized in Table I and compared to previously published results.31\u201333 At this point, we note that in order to compare the calculated shifts with those observed experimentally, it is very important to consider the CO coverage. For example, it is tempting to interpret the experimental \u0394\u03bd = +11 cm\u22121 shift using the values calculated with PBE+U at considerably low coverages such as 1/16 and 1/9 ML, with \u0394\u03bd = +932 and +1133 cm\u22121, respectively, but that is not correct. At CO saturation, the CO stretching vibrational frequency shift computed with the PBE+U approximation of about+1 cm\u22121 (Table I) is significantly smaller than the experimental value of \u0394\u03bd = +11 cm\u22121 (Fig. 2). However, the hybrid HSE06 functional predicts values of \u03bd = 2156 cm\u22121 and \u0394\u03bd = +13 cm\u22121 that are in good agreement with the experiment (\u03bd = 2154 cm\u221211, Fig. 2).\nInspection of the structures for the adsorption of CO on the CeO2(111) surfaces (Figs. 4 and S2) reveals that the Ce\u2013C distances are shorter with PBE+U than with HSE06. In addition, the C\u2013O bond length is longer with PBE+U than with HSE06, and the corresponding changes in the C\u2013O bond length, \u0394dC\u2013O, upon adsorption with respect to the calculated values for the gas phase molecule [114.34 (PBE+U) and 113.15 pm (HSE06)] show that (in most cases) \u0394dC\u2013O > 0 with PBE+U and \u0394dC\u2013O < 0 with HSE06. Specifically, the C\u2013O bond is calculated to be compressed by 0.06 pm (expanded by 0.04 pm) when using the HSE06 (PBE+U) functional at saturation coverage (Fig. 4). The shorter the C\u2013O bond, the higher the vibrational CO stretching frequency leading to a larger blue shift.\nThe overall change in the C\u2013O bond upon adsorption is the result of synergistic charge transfer effects, namely, CO \u2192 surface \u03c3 donation and surface \u2192 CO \u03c0 backdonation, which cause the shortening and lengthening of the C\u2013O bond length, respectively. In a recent study,29 we compared the density of states (DOS) for 1 ML of CO adsorbed on the oxidized CeO2(111) and (110) surfaces to that for the CO molecule in the gas phase. Figure 4 shows the DOS for 1 ML CO bound on top of a Ce4+ on all three oxidized low-index CeO2 surfaces, clearly illustrating the differences in the electronic structure of the bonded CO, as described with PBE+U and HSE06; the HOMO\u2013LUMO gap of CO is smaller when using the PBE+U method (cf. Table II). This occurs on all three lowindex CeO2 surfaces (cf. Table II). Moreover, compared to HSE06, the PBE+U approach predicts larger charge transfers, namely, CO \u2192 surface, as evidenced by the more pronounced electron density accumulation in the shorter Ce\u2013C bond, and surface \u2192 CO, as evidenced by the enhancement electron density at the O end of the longer C\u2013O bond, and as a result, \u0394dC\u2013O > 0 (Fig. 4)."

The most recent studies in the literature, independently of the specific implementation of periodic DFT calculations (different unit cell sizes, underlying exchangecorrelation functional, U value in DFT+U, etc.), generally agree that the subsurface vacancy (VSS) is more stable than the superficial one (VS) and that the Ce3+ ions prefer sites that are not adjacent to the vacancies, preferably in the outermost cationic layer (cf. Fig. S1). In the case of a reduced surface with (2 \u00d7 2) periodicity, the subsurface\nvacancy is more stable than the surface vacancy by \u223c0.4 eV (PBE+U), with the Ce3+ in the next-nearest neighboring cation sites to the vacant oxygen site for both types of vacancies, one in the outermost cationic plane and the other in the plane below.\nFigure 5 shows the optimized structures and the calculated frequency shifts for CO adsorption on the reduced CeO2\u2212x(111) surface with (2 \u00d7 2) periodicity (1 CO, \u03b8 = 1/4) with either one surface of subsurface oxygen vacancy in the outermost CeO2 oxide layer or the HSE06 approach. For the corresponding results with the PBE+U approach, see the supplementary material (Fig. S3, Table S2). The CO species on top of the nearest neighbor surface Ce4+ cation to the surface oxygen vacancy is more stable than that on top of the next-nearest neighbor surface Ce3+ cation (not shown). With HSE06, the latter structure is, in fact, unstable, and with the PBE+U approach, it is \u223c0.1 eV less stable than on top of a Ce4+, a configuration for which the calculated adsorption energies are comparable (Fig. S3, Table S2), cf. \u22120.22 (HSE06) to \u22120.24 eV (PBE+U). However, the calculated frequency shift with HSE06 (+24 cm\u22121) is much larger than that with PBE+U (+3 cm\u22121).

In addition, in this case, the calculated frequency shift with HSE06 (+27 cm\u22121) is larger than that with PBE+U (+17 cm\u22121).\nFor a higher CO coverage of \u03b8 = 1 (Figs. 5 and S3, Table S2), with 4 CO molecules, each of them on top of a surface cationic site (3 \u00d7 Ce4+ and 1 \u00d7 Ce3+), the calculated adsorption energies for both surface and subsurface vacancy types, and with both computational approaches, are slightly lower compared to those at the lower CO coverage of \u03b8 = 1/4 (cf. \u22120.19 to \u22120.24 eV with PBE+U and \u22120.18 to \u22120.22 eV with HSE06 for the example of the surface vacancy). However, similarly to the case of \u03b8 = 1/4, the frequency shifts are significantly influenced by the computational approach (cf. Figs. 5 and S3, Table S2).\nTwo factors need to be considered when comparing the calculated shifts with the experimental one of +20 cm\u22121 (cf. Fig. 2), namely, the approximation to exchange and correlation and the CO coverage. For instance, at 1/4 ML, PBE+U with shifts of +3 and +17 cm\u22121 for surface and subsurface vacancies, respectively (Fig. S3, Table S2), would erroneously suggest that CO could be used to probe the subsurface nature of the vacant sites,31,32 but that is not true as explained below. Moreover, upon increasing the CO coverage from 1/4 to 1 ML with PBE+U, the shift in the presence of a subsurface oxygen vacancy decreases dramatically from +17 cm\u22121 for CO coverage of \u03b8 = 1/4 to +2 cm\u22121 for \u03b8 = 1 (Fig. S3, Table S2). However, HES06, with a corresponding shift of +16 cm\u22121 at 1 ML (Fig. 5), provides a much better agreement with the experiment [+20 cm\u22121, cf.\nFigs. 5(c), 5(d), and 2]. Nonetheless, given the similarities of the values of \u0394\u03bd calculated for the cases of surface and subsurface vacancies (Fig. 5), CO would not allow unequivocally characterizing the nature of the oxygen vacancies near the surface, but O2 does.32"

An adsorption site for CO atop Ce4+ is found, with the CO binding nearly perpendicular to the surface. Interestingly, the calculations revealed that in addition to this upright adsorption geometry, two tilted configurations with slightly larger binding energies (by \u223c0.05 eV) were also found (Fig. 6). The difference between the tilted configurations is that in one case, the CO molecule points to the Ce4+ cation in the second oxide plane (Tilt.1, Fig. 6), and in the other one, to the Ce4+ cation on the surface (Tilt.2, Fig. 6).\nThe PBE+U calculated binding energy for the atop Ce4+ site \u2a850.2 eV (in absolute value, Fig. S4, Table S3) is consistent with that\nFIG. 7.

The HSE06 calculated binding energies are comparable to those obtained with PBE+U (Fig. S4, Table S3).\nOnly the HSE06 calculated CO stretching frequencies, \u03bd, and their shifts with respect to those of the free molecule, \u0394\u03bd, are in good agreement with the results of the IRRAS experiment, with deviations <9 cm\u22121. The more intense band at 2170 cm\u22121 and the less intense one at 2154 cm\u22121 observed with p-polarized light are assigned to CO bound to Ce4+ in atop and slightly tilted configurations, respectively (cf. Figs. 2 and 6). While the agreement with the HSE06 calculations is rather good, the deviations of the computed \u03bd and \u0394\u03bd values for CO adsorbed on the CeO2(110) surface with PBE+U from the experimental ones are substantial. In particular, for the tilted configuration, a red shift of \u0394\u03bd = \u221223 cm\u22121 is computed, clearly outside the experimental error (Fig. S4, Table S3). Herschend et al.56 reported a blue-shifted peak of +9 cm\u22121 for the top configuration obtained using hybrid-DFT embedded cluster calculations, but a red shift of \u22125 cm\u22121 and a smaller bandgap with a GGA functional (cf. Table II).\nAs in the case of the (111) orientation discussed earlier, the geometric and electronic structures for the adsorption of CO on the CeO2(110) surfaces were inspected. Figure S4 reveals that the Ce\u2013C distances are shorter with PBE+U than with HSE06. In addition, the C\u2013O bond length is longer with PBE+U than with HSE06, and the corresponding changes in the C\u2013O bond length, \u0394dC\u2013O, upon adsorption with respect to the calculated values for the gas phase molecule [114.34 (PBE+U) and 113.15 pm (HSE06)] show that (in most cases) \u0394dC\u2013O > 0 with PBE+U and \u0394dC\u2013O < 0 with HSE06. Specifically, the C\u2013O bond is calculated to be compressed by 0.18 pm and up to about 0.1 pm in the atop and tilted configurations, respectively, when using the HSE06 functional at saturation coverage. A compression of about 0.1 pm has been previously calculated for the atop configuration employing the hybrid B3LYP functional.57 However, for the tilted configurations, the PBE+U calculated C\u2013O bond is stretched by about 0.1 pm in both cases. As for the electronic structure, for all configurations, the HOMO\u2013LUMO gap of CO is smaller, and the CO\u2192 surface and surface\u2192 CO charge transfers are larger with PBE+U than with HSE06 (cf. Table II and Fig. 4 for the example of the top configuration at saturation coverage).\nThe coupling between adjacent CO molecules on CeO2(110) is rather weak. To demonstrate that we have performed additional calculations for differently ordered phases of CO on the CeO2(110) surface with (2 \u00d7 2) periodicity and 1 ML with HSE06 (Fig. 7). Five different arrangements for the four CO molecules have been explored, including configurations with 4 \u00d7 Tilt.1, 3 \u00d7 Tilt.1 and 1 \u00d7 Top, 2 \u00d7 Tilt.1 and 2 \u00d7 Top, 1 \u00d7 Tilt.1 and 3 \u00d7 Top, and 4 \u00d7 Top CO. The calculated vibrational frequencies indicate that the in-phase collective stretching of all four CO tilted molecules and that of all four atop molecules are hardly affected when the mixed structure is considered.29 In these cases, the concerted in-phase stretching mode of the four CO molecules is the one that has a non-negligible IR intensity, while the other three collective modes do (Fig. 7).\nFor the adsorption of 1/4 ML CO on to the oxidized (110) surface with (2 \u00d7 2) periodicity, a similar performance of the PBE+U and HSE06 approaches for the description of the interaction of the surface bound CO has been found, compared to the results for 1 ML (Fig. S4, Table S3).29 As for the (111) surfaces discussed earlier, the\nresults at saturation coverage with the HSE06 functional provide the best agreement with the experimental values."

However, when CO occupies all Ce-bridge sites at saturation coverage (\u03b8 = 1), the frequency shift of the collective in-phase stretch vibration is +14 cm\u22121 (Fig. 10). These results show once again the significant effect that CO coverage could have on the calculated frequencies.\nFigure 11 shows the assignments of the experimentally observed shifts (Fig. 2) for CO adsorption on the oxidized and reduced (100) surfaces at saturation CO coverage based on HSE06 calculations (cf. Figs. 9 and 10).\nWe note that the band shifted by +4 cm\u22121 is observed for both reduced and oxidized surfaces with similar intensity (Fig. 2). The intensity and sign of vibrational bands in IRRAS can vary strongly depending on the interaction of the transition dipole moment with the p- and s-polarized components of the incident light. For the reduced CeO2(100) surface, the intensity of the 2147 cm\u22121 band could be explained in terms of the slight modification of the chemical environment of this CO species on the reduced surface.

In both cases, a nearly perpendicular top Ce4+ adsorption site has been found, and on the (110) facet, two tilted configurations have also been found. The calculated blue shifts of \u0394\u03bd = +1, +8 cm\u22121 with PBE+U for a top configuration on the (111) and (110) facets at full coverage, respectively, and red shifts of \u221223 and \u221213 cm\u22121 for the tilted configurations on the (110), substantially deviate from the experimental values of \u0394\u03bd = +11 cm\u22121 for both top configurations and +27 cm\u22121 for the tilted ones. Moreover, it is observed that by decreasing the CO coverage from 1 to 1/4 ML, larger shifts are generally obtained with both computational approaches and for both oxidized and reduced surfaces. For example, for the top configurations, shifts of \u0394\u03bd = +2, +11 cm\u22121 on the oxidized (111) and (110) facets, respectively, have been obtained with PBE+U and 1/4 ML CO coverage, i.e., an increase of +1 and +3 cm\u22121, respectively, compared to 1 ML. The corresponding increases with HSE06 are +4 and +1 cm\u22121.\nFor the reduced CeO2\u2212x(111) surface at full CO coverage, it is difficult to discern whether the experimental shift of +20 cm\u22121 is due to the presence of a surface or subsurface vacancy since, with HSE06, shifts of +24 and +16 cm\u22121, respectively, have been obtained (Table III). The corresponding values with PBE+U are +2 cm\u22121 for both cases, which are clearly not in agreement with the experimental value of +20 cm\u22121. The reduced CeO2\u2212x(111) surface is another example of how important it is to consider both the actual experimental CO coverage in the model and the accuracy of the approximation to exchange and correlation in the DFT calculations. For example, shifts of +3 and +17 cm\u22121 due to the presence of a surface or subsurface vacancy have been obtained with PBE+U and 1/4 ML CO coverage, mistakenly suggesting that CO would\ndistinguish the nature of oxygen vacancies. Furthermore, for the reduced CeO2\u2212x(110) surface at full CO coverage, only the presence of surface vacancies has been considered, and at full CO coverage, a shift of +25 cm\u22121 has been obtained with HSE06, in good agreement with the experimental value of +32 cm\u22121, while the corresponding PBE+U result is +3 cm\u22121.\nFor the CeO2(100) surface, we provide a new CO band assignment as a result of having considered full CO coverage and the HSE06 functional (Table III). Our results with HSE06 indicate that the experimentally observed blue shifts of +33 and +4 cm\u22121 correspond to the adsorption of CO on the bridge and top sites of the oxidized (100) surface, whereas the shift of +25 cm\u22121 corresponds to the adsorption of CO on the reduced surface. In this case, it is also difficult to discern whether the experimental shift of +25 cm\u22121 is due to the presence of a surface or subsurface vacancy.\nThe HSE06 method is computationally very expensive compared to PBE+U. On average, the computational time, calculated as [Number of central processing units (CPUs)] \u00d7 (time), of a structure relaxation with HSE06 is 100\u00d7 more expensive than with PBE+U. As an example, 384 CPU hours (96 CPUs \u00d7 4 h) were required for the structure optimization of CO/CeO2(111) with 1 \u00d7 1 periodicity with the HSE06 method. However, the choice of the model (CO coverage) and the methodology are crucial to obtain a more accurate description of the geometric and electronic structures of the CO/CeO2 systems and, in turn, of the CO vibrational spectra. The HSE06 method does cure the shortcomings of the PBE+U, such as the small HOMO\u2013LUMO gap of CO and the large CO\u2192surface and surface\u2192CO charge transfers.\nJ. Chem.

Considering our results for the CO/CeO2 systems, we think that there is room for surprises if other CO/oxide systems are revisited. Our findings thus provide a theoretical basis for the detailed interpretation of experiments and open up the path to characterizing more complex scenarios, such as probing the surface of oxide-based catalysts with high specificity under operando conditions (e.g., using diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy, or DRIFTS), where changes in particle shape and faceting might occur.\nSUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL\nThe supplementary material includes top and side views of the unrelaxed ceria surfaces; details of the computations; and a comparison of the optimized structures of CO adsorption on the oxidized and reduced ceria surfaces obtained with the PBE+U and HSE06 approaches."
