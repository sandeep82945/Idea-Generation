    "abstractText": "Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Ischemia and hypoxia following myocardial infarction (MI) cause subsequent cardiomyocyte (CM) loss, cardiac remodeling, and heart failure. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are involved in vasculogenesis, angiogenesis and paracrine effects and thus have important clinical value in alternative processes for repairing damaged hearts. In fact, this study showed that the endogenous repair of EPCs may not be limited to a single cell type. EPC interactions with cardiac cell populations and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in ischemic heart disease can attenuate cardiac inflammation and oxidative stress in a microenvironment, regulate cell survival and apoptosis, nourish CMs, enhance mature neovascularization, alleviate adverse ventricular remodeling after infarction and enhance ventricular function. In this review, we introduce the definition and discuss the origin and biological characteristics of EPCs and summarize the mechanisms of EPC recruitment in ischemic heart disease. We focus on the crosstalk between EPCs and endothelial cells (ECs), smooth muscle cells (SMCs), CMs, cardiac fibroblasts (CFs), cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs), and MSCs during cardiac remodeling and repair. Finally, we discuss the translation of EPC therapy to the clinic and treatment strategies.",

Ischemia and hypoxia following myocardial infarction (MI) cause subsequent\ncardiomyocyte (CM) loss, cardiac remodeling, and heart failure. Endothelial progenitor\ncells (EPCs) are involved in vasculogenesis, angiogenesis and paracrine effects and thus\nhave important clinical value in alternative processes for repairing damaged hearts. In\nfact, this study showed that the endogenous repair of EPCs may not be limited to a\nsingle cell type. EPC interactions with cardiac cell populations and mesenchymal stem\ncells (MSCs) in ischemic heart disease can attenuate cardiac inflammation and oxidative\nstress in a microenvironment, regulate cell survival and apoptosis, nourish CMs, enhance\nmature neovascularization, alleviate adverse ventricular remodeling after infarction and\nenhance ventricular function. In this review, we introduce the definition and discuss the\norigin and biological characteristics of EPCs and summarize the mechanisms of EPC\nrecruitment in ischemic heart disease. We focus on the crosstalk between EPCs and\nendothelial cells (ECs), smooth muscle cells (SMCs), CMs, cardiac fibroblasts (CFs),\ncardiac progenitor cells (CPCs), and MSCs during cardiac remodeling and repair. Finally,\nwe discuss the translation of EPC therapy to the clinic and treatment strategies.\nKeywords: ischemic heart disease, endothelial progenitor cells, cardiac remodeling, cardiac repair, angiogenesis, crosstalk\nINTRODUCTION\nCardiovascular disease (CVD), primarily ischemic heart disease (IHD), remains the leading cause of global disability and mortality (1). IHD is characterized by a loss of myocardial cell function due to insufficient blood supply flowing from the coronary arteries to the heart, followed by ventricular dysfunction and progressive heart failure. After myocardial infarction (MI), tissue damage and necrosis initiate a series of pathological responses, such as inflammation, oxidative stress, neurohormonal system activation, and hemodynamic load regulation, which lead to fibrotic scarring during the replacement of lost cardiomyocytes (CMs) (2, 3). Subsequently, the injured heart undergoes remodeling which leads to further cardiac hypertrophy, ventricular dilation and reduced contractility involving cellular and interstitial changes at themyocardial tissue level, mainly fibrosis, which ultimately leads to fatal heart failure (4). The current treatment for IHD mainly involves percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) to achieve revascularization, increase blood supply and save the injured ischemic myocardium (5).\nStem cell therapy has been widely used to treat IHD, providing patients with drug-free and non-surgical treatment and encouraging safer and more feasible cardiac repair strategies (6). Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), also known as vascular endothelial precursor cells, exhibit the potential to enter the blood circulation and undergo proliferation and differentiation into multiple cell types (7). Studies have shown that EPC number and function are closely related to endothelial cell (EC) injury and dysfunction and can be used in the clinic as biomarkers of vascular function and cumulative cardiovascular risk (8). EPCs are involved in cardiac repair after MI through regulation of immune responses, neovascularization, extracellular matrix deposition and cardiac microenvironment formation. In this review, we introduce the biological characteristics and recruitment mechanism of EPCs, discuss the impact of crosstalk between EPCs and related cardiac cells and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on cardiac remodeling and repair after ischemic cardiomyopathy, and report the current clinical implications of EPC therapy."

            "heading": "THE DEFINITION, ORIGIN, AND BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF EPCs",
            "text": "In 1997, Asahara and colleagues were the first researchers to identify a population of cells capable of differentiating into mature ECs and undergoing postnatal angiogenesis, and they called the cells in this subset \u201cputative endothelial progenitor cells\u201d (9). It was initially thought that EPCs originated and resided in bone marrow (BM) and were mobilized to circulate in adult peripheral blood (PB) or umbilical cord blood (UCB) (10). Since no uniform isolation or culturing protocol for EPCs has been reported and because EPCs express different surface antigens at different stages of maturation or differentiation, EPC subpopulations exhibit various phenotypes (11). Two clear types of EPC have been identified on the basis phenotype and function: hematopoietic EPCs (myeloid) and endothelial lineage EPCs (12). The hematopoietic EPC lineage includes myeloid angiogenic cells (MACs), circulating angiogenic cells (CACs) and early EPCs. EPCs with this immunophenotype express CD45, CD14, and CD31 but not CD146 or CD133. These cells do not have the capacity to differentiate into ECs but promote angiogenesis through paracrine signaling. The endothelial lineage includes endothelial outgrowth cells (OECs) or late EPCs and endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs), which are also widely recognized as \u201cbona fide EPCs\u201d and show the ability to undergo clonal expansion and self-renewal, form blood vessels and intima, and continuously be incorporate into and contribute to the formation of the host vascular system (12\u201314). Recently, CD133, CD34, and VEGFR-2 (also known as KDR or Flk-1) have been the most commonly used biomarkers to identify or characterize EPCs (15). However, other recent studies have shown that circulating CD19\u2212 CD34+ EPCs do not express VEGFR-2, which is expressed only in CD19+ B cells (16). When expression of sca1+/flk1+ cells were observed in mice, the expression of B-cell-specific surface markers was found to be upregulated. It has been speculated that currently\ncharacterized EPCs are not truly EPCs but are lymphocytes, mainly B2 lymphocytes; therefore, scientists need to engage in further research and discussion (17). Although BM is considered the classic source of EPCs, Fujisawa et al. found that circulating EPCs isolated from vessel walls and PB of male patients who had undergone BM transplantation from female donors displayed XY genotype (18). In addition, Ingram et al. found that a complete hierarchy of EPCs can be identified in human umbilical vein ECs or human aortic ECs, showing that EPCs may originate from blood vessels (19). EPCs have been found to reside in the vasculature beds of various tissues, and CD157 or EPCR have been proposed as markers to identify tissue-resident EPCs (20). Surprisingly, a recent study reported marker genes, secreted factors, microRNAs (miRNAs), and growth factors of EPCs on the basis of single-cell transcriptomic analyses to better optimize and characterize the EPC subpopulation in adult PB. In this study, BMB2, BMP4, and Ephrin B2 were highly expressed only in EPCs, not ECs, in three different tissues. The neuropilin1, VEGF-C, Notch 1, PECAM-1, and MIR-21 genes were differentially expressed. CD62L and PLAUR expression levels can be used as markers for the isolation and characterization of EPCs derived from monocytes (21).\nEPCs participate in vascular and cardiac repair in coronary atherosclerosis (22), ischemic cardiomyopathy (23), and diabetic cardiomyopathy (24). During tissue or vascular injury, circulating EPCs are recruited to injury sites, enabling the growth of new blood vessels that are formed from an extension of existing ECs (angiogenesis) or de novo (vasculogenesis) (25). At the same time, soluble factors and EPC exosomes (EXs) and microvesicles (MVs) secreted by EPCs can attenuate a deleterious microenvironment formed during inflammation and oxidative stress (26), regulate cell survival and apoptosis (27), inhibit mesenchymal cell transformation and fibrosis (28), promote the homing of stem/progenitor cells (29), nourish CMs and induce angiogenesis (30), thereby exerting beneficial effects."

Receptors (Patch, CXCR4, CXCR7, VEGFR2, TNFR2, and Notch) and ligands (SHH, SDF-1, VEGF, TNF\u03b1, and Jagged 1) are shown on the membranes of EPCs. The SDF-1\u03b1/CXCR4/CXCR7, VEGFR, TNF\u03b1, SHH, and Notch signaling pathways engage in crosstalk with the intracellular PI3K/Akt/eNOS, ERK1/2, STAT3, and NF-kB pathways and regulate the development of EPCs in ischemic heart disease, including the mobilization, proliferation, migration, survival, and differentiation of EPCs.\nmobilization, proliferation, migration, invasion, angiogenesis, and differentiation (Table 1).\nMiRNAs are endogenous small non-coding single-stranded RNAs with regulatory activity that lead to degradation of target mRNA or reduced protein translation by binding to the complete or incomplete complementary site of the 3\u2019-untranslated region (UTR) of targetmRNA (49). Chang et al. identified the expression profiles of miRNAs in early EPCs, late EPCs, and human umbilical vein ECs, and this profile can be used to determine novel biomarkers for the prevention and treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD) (50). Previous reviews have presented summaries of the roles played by miRNAs in regulating EPC proliferation, mobilization, migration, differentiation, apoptosis, autophagy, senescence, adhesion, and tubule formation, as well as EPC-induced angiogenesis (51). EPCs face the challenge of hypoxia in ischemic tissue, and overexpression of miR-130a and miR-210-3p at the cellular level can enhance the proliferation, migration and tube formation of EPCs under hypoxic conditions (34, 35). Li et al. found that EPCs transfected with miR-3265p exhibited significantly increased tube formation in Matrigel plugs and angiogenesis in the MI model (36). Liu et al. observed that miR-144-3p in circulating exosomes disrupted the MMP9 pathway by targeting the expression of Ets1 in MSCs and inhibited the mobilization of EPCs after myocardial infarction (40). Notably, recent studies have revealed that overexpression of miR-324-5p and miR-126 in EPCs can reduce the apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production rates and prevent oxidative stress-induced EPC damage (38, 39). Maintaining\nthe cardiac microenvironment by regulating oxidative stress can maintain endothelial stability and promote angiogenesis and remodeling.\nLncRNAs are longer than 200 bp and exhibit regulatory ability but lack protein-coding capacity, and they play important roles in physiology and disease pathology (52). Li et al. found that the lncRNA WTAPP1 positively regulated the migration, invasion and angiogenesis of human peripheral blood-derived EPCs and mediated the effects of EPCs through the PI3K/Akt and autophagy pathways (41). By knocking down lncRNAp21 expression, the adhesion and migration of EPCs were weakened, and the repairing effect of EPCs after vascular endothelial injury was disrupted (42).

EPCs are precursors of ECs, and BM-EPCs can migrate to sites of ischemic injury, integrate into the original vasculature, differentiate into ECs, and restore the integrity of vascular ECs and their functions (25, 105). On the other hand, EPC-derived anti-apoptotic and pro-angiogenic factors (such as IGF, VEGF, FGF-2, HGF, and SCF) and anti-inflammatory factors stimulate the original ECs and promote new blood vessel formation (91).\nEC dysfunction is defined as a state in which reduced NO bioavailability and increased ROS-related oxidative stress cause impaired vasodilation and promote inflammation and coagulation (106). EPCs have been shown to express eNOS, and activated eNOS promotes NO production to prevent EC damage\n(107). In ischemic or inflammatory tissue microenvironments with elevated ROS levels, the expression of catalase, copperzinc superoxide dismutase (Cu/ZnSOD), manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2 in EPCs was increased, supporting the supposition that ECs are resistant to ROS-induced toxicity, thereby maintaining their viability and functional activity (26). In addition, recent studies have shown that the endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) is an important process in vascular endothelial injury and is closely related to plaque stability and endothelial microenvironment homeostasis in coronary atherosclerosis (108). The EndMT causes ECs to lose their endothelial characteristics and acquire a mesenchymal-like cell (SMC and fibroblast) phenotype (109, 110). EPCs undergo the EndMT to differentiate into smooth muscle-like cells after treatment with TGF\u03b2, and TGF-\u03b2 exacerbates promotes cardiac fibrosis by inducing the EndMT (109, 111). Zhang et al. found that overexpression of miR126 inhibited the EndMT of EPCs, suggesting that intimal hyperplasia in CAD is inhibited through the EndMT (92). Moreover, the upregulation of miR-221 expression repressed the EndMT of EPCs, possibly by interacting with PTEN to regulate FoxO3a signaling, and promoted EPC acquisition of the endothelial phenotype (93).\nNumerous studies have confirmed that EPCs and EPC-extracellular vesicle (EV)-carried miRNAs have angiogenic/vasculogenic properties (112). Templin et al. isolated CD34+ cells from patients with acute ST-segmentelevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and found that miR-378 expression was significantly upregulated and may have promoted angiogenesis through paracrine vascular growth factor signaling (94). Overexpression of miR-326-5p and miR-126-3p in EPCs significantly promoted tubular structure formation and angiogenesis. Furthermore, miR-326-5p- and miR-126-3p-overexpressing EPCs transplanted into an AMI animal model promoted a significant increase in angiogenesis in the area surrounding MI-damaged tissue and improved left ventricular hemodynamic function (36, 95). EPC-MV-carried miR-126 attenuated ROS-induced vascular endothelial injury and EC apoptosis in a hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury model (27). In addition, the content of EPC-EVs changes under inflammatory conditions and impairs the repair ability of EPC-EVs in ischemic heart tissue. Yue et al. found specific enrichment of integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and miR-375 in IL-10KO-EPC-Exos by IL-10 knockout mimicking systemic inflammatory conditions. By knocking down ILK and miR375 in IL-10KO EPC-Exos, NF-kB activation was inhibited in endothelial cells, and the inflammation-induced apoptosis and angiogenic capacity of EPCs and ECs were rescued (96, 97)."

Fibroblasts acquire endothelial-like functions through the mesenchymal-endothelial transition (MEndT) and participate in angiogenesis in damaged heart areas, reversing myocardial fibrosis (121).\nEXs derived from EPCs induced the upregulated expression of MEndT-related genes and reduced high mobility box 1 protein B1 expression to promote CF differentiation into ECs (122). Reduced basic fibroblast growth factor and increased angiogenesis in ischemic hearts after EPC EX treatment reduced the area of cardiac fibrosis. Therefore, it was inferred that the proangiogenic function of EPC-derived EXs may be partially attributable of the activated MEndT of CFs (117). However, how EPC-derived EXs regulate the MEndT has not been elucidated to date. By performing a microarray analysis, Huang et al. found differential expression of miRNAs in EPCs and EPC-derived EXs carrying miR-1246 and miR-1290 targeted the binding of the transcription factors ELF5 and SP1 in fibroblasts, inducing endothelial marker CD31 expression (123). In a prior study, p53 signaling was found to activate fibroblast MEndT, enhance vascularity, and improve cardiac function (121). Ke et al. found that EPC-EV-derived miRNAs, specifically the upregulated expression of p53 by miR-218-5p and the downregulated expression of JMY by miR-363-3p, might have alleviated myocardial fibrosis and improved cardiac function by inducing the MEndT to increase angiogenesis (124). Lin et al. performed YBX-1-mediated sorting of miR-133 into H/R-induced EPC-derived EXs and found that they increased fibroblast angiogenesis and the MEndT rate (28). Interestingly, EXs containing Shh protein secreted by Shh-modified CD34+ cells may have mediated the transdifferentiation of resident fibroblasts to ECs by activating the Shh signaling pathway (99).

On the one hand, coculturing MSCs and EPCs enhanced the therapeutic properties of the MSCs, and up-regulation of connexin 43 and integrin-5 expression promoted local intercellular communication and increased MSC engraftment integration capacity (132). Paracrine factors in EPCs stimulated MSCs while maintaining the adhesion and proliferation properties of ECs, thereby supporting efficient angiogenesis (133).

To ensure successful EPC engraftment and promote rapid endothelialization, circulating EPCs can be captured by an EPCs scaffold; that is, EPCs bind to the scaffold surface, and then, the EPCs differentiate into a functional endothelial layer (136). To date, EPC-specific antibodies (monoclonal antibodies against CD133, CD34, and CD146), aptamers (DNA aptamers), polypeptides (Arg-Gly-Asp peptides), and magnetic molecules (superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles) have been widely used in cardiovascular biomaterials to improve the therapeutic effect of EPC capture scaffolds (137). Multiple research groups have evaluated the safety and feasibility of EPCs via endocardial injection, direct injection into the infarcted myocardium, and intracoronary infusion in CVD (angina, MI, and heart failure) (138\u2013140). Stamm et al. found that injection of purified CD133+ progenitor cells into the myocardial infarct border zone during CABG found that left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was significantly higher in the CABG and cell combination treatment group than in the CABG-only group after 6 months (139).

The implantation of double-layered cell sheets constructed by coculturing EPCs with SMCs or MSCs improved the ability of tissues to form capillary-like networks and a functional vascular bed, while coculturing stimulated mutual paracrine effects to enhance cell survival and differentiation (113, 114, 132). New regenerative medicine approaches were used to treat CVDs through cell-free therapy by exploiting the paracrine signaling mechanisms of stem and progenitor cells, EXs derived from EPCs that carry proangiogenic and cardioprotective cargo, and transplantation of EPC EXs to promote myocardial angiogenesis and recovery of cardiac function after infarction (142). Chen et al. demonstrated sustained delivery of EPC-derived EVs to the ischemic myocardium via injectable hydrogels in a rat model of MI, followed by uptake by ECs, increased vascular density in the infarcted area, and improved cardiac hemodynamics and cardiac reshaping (143). The successful regeneration capacity mediated through cell therapy requires consideration of key factors such\nFrontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine | www.frontiersin.org 9 May 2022 | Volume 9 | Article 896782\nas the source of the transplanted cells, dose of the cells, efficacy of the cells, delivery time, and route of administration (144). Currently, EPCs are inconsistently defined, and therefore, the cell types used in clinical trials vary, particularly in terms of cell isolation, culturing methods, and characterization of cell surface markers. In addition, the cell dose and route of administration vary from trial to trial, making it difficult to compare results from different clinical trials (145). Studies have shown that obtaining sufficient ECFCs from PB is difficult in many cases; however, ECFCs isolated from umbilical cord blood show high proliferative potential and contain relatively high levels of telomerase activity to prevent aging (10). Human induced pluripotent stem cells can reproducibly form isolated homogeneous and stable populations with umbilical cord blood ECFC properties, which include high proliferative and no teratoma-forming potential (146). In addition, different degrees of tissue ischemia, hypoxia, inflammation, and oxidative stress in ischemic diseases cause EPCs to exhibit reduced proliferative capacity, dysfunction, and reduced angiogenic capacity, resulting in a low survival rate of transplanted cells in host tissues (147). EPCs and EPC-derived EXs can be used to correct diseaseinduced cellular dysfunction by enhancing in vivo functions through genetic modification and preconditioning. For example, the combination of gene modification realized by overexpressing genes such as the miR-326-5p (36), miR-126-3p (95), sonic hedgehog (99), and IL-10 (77) genes in EPCs and subsequent EPC transplantation into AMI animal models was found to be significantly correlated with EPC function and cardiac function recovery. Treatment with high-dose statins before PCI promoted an increase in EPC abundance (148). Thymosin \u03b24 preconditioning enhanced the survival and angiogenic capacity of EPCs during MI and enhanced the repair of the infarcted myocardium (149)."

            "text": "Accumulating evidence suggests that EPCs are important players in endothelial dysfunction repair and angiogenesis, offering great promise for the treatment of CVD. On the one hand, EPCs promote angiogenesis and vascular remodeling in ischemic tissue and accelerate the process of IHD repair. On the other hand, the\nparacrine mechanism of EPCs improves the microenvironment after myocardial infarction, enhances cardiac remodeling and repair, and improves cardiac function. In recent years, great progress has been made in research on the role of EPCs in ischemic heart disease, stroke, pulmonary hypertension, and diabetes. However, there are some pressing issues that need to be addressed in future research and clinical trials. How can EPCs be used to establish clear/uniform criteria for definition, separation and quantification? How do circulating EPCs precisely and specifically target ischemic and damaged tissue? How can EPCs reduce the negative effects of ischemia, hypoxia, inflammation, and oxidative stress in disease settings? The paracrine signaling mechanism of EPCs, which comprises a complex network of crosstalk with other cardiac cell types and stem progenitor cells, serves an important repair function; however, the mechanisms of action of specific paracrine components (cytokines, proteins, and miRNAs), the specific cells targeted by EPCs, and the communication and signal transduction mechanisms between EPCs and other types of cells have not been fully elucidated. Therefore, further studies on the molecular mechanisms of these biological processes are expected to contribute to the translation of EPC therapy to the practice of precision medicine."
