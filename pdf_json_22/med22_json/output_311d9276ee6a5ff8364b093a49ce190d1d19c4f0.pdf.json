Insomnia is associated with a reduced quality of life,4 and is a risk factor for other mental disorders, in particular depression and anxiety disorders,5 as well as for cardiovascular diseases.6 7\nSTRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY \u21d2 This randomised controlled trial will recruit 4268 patients and will be the largest clinical trial on insomnia. \u21d2 This trial will investigate three different versions of a stepped care model for insomnia which rely on treatment by general practitioners in the entry level and differ in the amount of guidance by e- coaches in internet- delivered cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia. \u21d2 The primary outcome is insomnia severity.

BMJ Open 2022;12:e058212. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2021-058212\nClinical guidelines recommend cognitive- behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT- I) as first- line treatment.8 9 CBT- I is a multicomponent intervention consisting of psychoeducation, relaxation therapy, sleep restriction therapy, stimulus control therapy and cognitive therapy. However, only a small proportion of patients with insomnia has access to this treatment. For example, data from BARMER, a large German public health insurance, indicate that around 1.6% of the insured persons received a diagnosis of insomnia in 2017, but only 10% of these patients received a psychotherapeutic treatment.10 Assuming a prevalence of insomnia of 5.7% in Germany,11 this suggests that only 2.8% of all insomnia patients in Germany receive psychotherapeutic treatment. Since CBT is not the only form of psychotherapy reimbursed by German health insurances and the focus of the psychotherapeutic treatment may, in many patients, be a comorbid disorder rather than insomnia, the assumption that 1% of all insomnia patients receive CBT- I might already be a very optimistic estimation. Instead, many insomnia patients are treated with benzodiazepine receptor agonists or sedating antidepressants on a long- term basis,12 which is potentially harmful and not recommended by clinical guidelines.8 9 This situation is unfortunate both from a clinical and from a health- economic perspective. Insomnia is associated with estimated annual costs of about \u20ac5900 per person in Germany due to absenteeism and presenteeism.13 Thus, given its prevalence, a reasonable estimate of the indirect costs of insomnia in Germany is \u20ac25 billion per year. This number is broadly in line with previously published socioeconomic data from the USA14 and Canada.15\nThe dissemination of CBT- I is a major healthcare challenge, and internet- delivered psychotherapy has been suggested as a possible mean to lower the treatment gap.16 Compared with face- to- face treatment, main advantages of internet- delivered CBT- I are convenience, increased accessibility and potentially lower costs. In particular,\ninternet interventions are easily accessible anytime and anywhere. Patients do not incur travelling expenses; they can work at their own pace; they may provide more honest answers in the privacy of their own home; and barriers related to the stigma of mental disorders may be reduced.17 Hence, offering internet- delivered CBT- I might increase the utilisation of psychotherapy in undertreated populations. Meta- analyses suggest that internetdelivered CBT- I is highly effective in comparison to waitlist control conditions,18 19 and that the effects appear to be comparable in size to those of face- to- face CBT- I.20 In addition, follow- up data of up to 3 years demonstrate a high long- term effectiveness of online CBT- I.21 22\nHowever, at least two questions with a high degree of healthcare relevance remain to be answered. First, it is unclear how internet- delivered CBT- I can be effectively integrated into existing healthcare systems that rely on general practitioners (GPs) to take the lead in coordinating patient care. Previous research has shown that the implementation of CBT- I techniques in primary care is challenging but promising.23 24 In line with a stepped care approach to the treatment of insomnia,25 GPs may serve as the entry level of a multistep model that offers more intense support for those with more complicated complaints in a cost- effective way. Although conceptually appealing, there are very few studies investigating such stepped care models for insomnia,26\u201328 and none of them included active treatment provided by GPs. Second, little is known about the optimal level of therapist guidance in the context of internet- delivered CBT- I. While it is generally thought that human support has positive effects on adherence and efficacy in online mental health interventions,29 many studies in the insomnia field have successfully implemented online interventions without any human support/guidance.16 22 30 31 One study has directly compared an online intervention for insomnia with and without guidance via email and found a superior efficacy in the guided group.32 However, there is limited knowledge about who needs and who does not need guidance and how this translates into cost- effectiveness estimates.\nThe central objective of this study is to improve the quality and efficiency of healthcare for patients with insomnia. In addition, it is intended to improve interdisciplinary and intersectoral cooperation between GPs, psychotherapists and medical specialists working in outpatient and inpatient settings. Three different versions of a stepped care model (intervention group 1, IG1; intervention group 2, IG2; intervention group 3, IG3) that differ in the amount of guidance that is provided by e- coaches in the internet- delivered intervention in step 2 will be compared with treatment as usual (TAU) in, to the best of our knowledge, the largest clinical trial to date on insomnia (see figure 1). At step 1, participating GPs will provide a brief psychoeducational treatment; at step 2, patients will receive an internet intervention based on CBT- I; and at step 3, patients will be referred to specialised medical face- to- face treatment. Patients who are unresponsive to the treatment at one step will proceed to the\nP atna).

The primary research question is the effectiveness of the interventions. We will also investigate differential treatment outcomes in four subgroups of patients as follows: (1) insomnia without any comorbidity; (2) insomnia with mental comorbidity; (3) insomnia with somatic comorbidity; (4) insomnia with mental and somatic comorbidity. In addition, an economic evaluation will be carried out and qualitative interviews will be conducted to explore barriers and facilitators of the stepped care model. In case of a positive evaluation, it is intended to include the stepped care model in the guidelines of the Federal Joint Committee, the highest decision- making body of the joint self- government of physicians, dentists, hospitals, and health insurance funds in Germany."

The treatment includes the following psychoeducational recommendations: (1) avoid alcohol as a hypnotic; (2) avoid clock- watching at night; (3) avoid afternoon caffeine use; (4) exercise regularly. In addition, the following stimulus control instructions will be given by the GPs: (1) use the bed only for sleep and sexual activity; (2) get out of bed when unable to sleep; (3) do not nap during the day. Of note, the GPs do not use standardised leaflets that summarise the psychoeducational recommendations. GPs can also consult a psychiatrist of the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of the Medical Centre\u2014University of Freiburg whenever they feel that discontinuation of hypnotic medication would be appropriate. After 4 weeks, all patients in the intervention groups will receive an email with a link providing the\nopportunity to access step 2 of the stepped care model without further consultation of the GPs. Importantly, for each patient, GPs can decide to skip step 1 of the stepped care model if they do not expect a substantial impact on insomnia severity.\nStep 2 At step 2 of the stepped care model, the GET.ON Institut f\u00fcr Online Gesundheitstrainings (operating under the registered brand \u2018HelloBetter\u2019) will provide an internet intervention based on CBT- I with an accompanying mobile sleep diary app. The intervention was initially developed at Leuphana University L\u00fcneburg by the team of author DL and was positively evaluated in three randomised controlled trials.39\u201341 Since the intervention was initially designed for workers, it has been adapted and technically updated for the current study by HelloBetter to meet the needs of all potential patients. Treatment content is based on CBT- I manuals and includes psychoeducation, relaxation therapy, sleep restriction therapy, stimulus control therapy, and cognitive interventions targeting rumination and worry. Delivery is structured into eight sessions, lasting approximately 45\u201360 min each. Participants are instructed to complete one session per week resulting in an overall duration of 8 weeks. However, participants are allowed to work through the sessions faster or slower accounting for interindividual differences in the therapeutic process.\nPatients of the three IGs receive an initial and a final consultation (each about 20 min) with one of a team of e- coaches of HelloBetter, who are trained and supervised psychologists. The consultations will be conducted by telephone, or, if this is not possible, by in- platform messages. In addition to the initial and final consultation, patients randomised to the \u2018standard\u2019 version of the intervention (IG1) receive written feedback and support by the responsible e- coach after each session. E- coaches are instructed to spend, on average, 25 min per session for writing this feedback. Patients randomised to the \u2018flex\u2019 version of the intervention (IG2) receive written on- demand support by the responsible e- coach. Patients randomised to the \u2018basic\u2019 version of the intervention (IG3) do not receive additional human guidance.\nThe treatment platform operates according to the ISO 27000 and NEN 7510 standards. All data is securely stored on ISO 27000- certified servers and transmitted via Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates (AES- 256 and SHA- 1, 2048- bit RSA). Industry- standard measures have been taken to ensure robust security for the platform.\nStep 3 In step 3 of the stepped care model, non- responders will be referred by their GPs to specialised medical treatment. The decision about this referral lies with the responsible GP and is based on clinical judgement of response. However, the responsible e- coach of HelloBetter will send a report to the GP summarising step 2 treatment\nP atna).

Hence, this issue has been discussed among the clinicians involved in the current trial who are nationally and internationally leading experts in the field of insomnia research. Most clinicians agreed that 1.5 or more points on the ISI (exhibiting a common SD of 6.0 points) are a reasonable minimally important difference corresponding to a minimally important effect size of d=0.25. Based on previous research, it is assumed that all intervention groups (IG1, IG2, IG3) exhibit a considerably larger difference to the TAU group of at least d=0.50.24 Because of this, for ethical reasons and to reduce costs, the sample size calculation is based on the comparisons between the IGs, and the GPs are randomised with an allocation ratio of 3:3:3:1 (IG1, IG2, IG3, TAU), which ensures sufficient power for both differences between any IG and TAU (of at least d=0.35) as well for differences between IGs (of at least d=0.25). Based on 320 GPs with a median recruitment rate of n=9 \u00b1 14 patients, an ICC of 0.02 (see Adams et al71 for comparison), a correlation of the outcome at T3 with the corresponding baseline assessment of r=0.5, d=0.25, an \u03b1 of 0.05 and (1-\u03b2) of 80%, the required sample size is n=1067 for each of the four subgroups of patients (IGs: n=320 each; TAU: n=107). Thus, a total sample size of N=4268 (IGs: n=1280 each; TAU: n=428) is required. Sampling procedures for the qualitative interviews follow theoretical data saturation principles.72 73"

The primary effectiveness analysis will be conducted according to the intention- to- treat principle based on all patients with their original treatment allocation. Additionally, per- protocol analyses based on the data of patients who completed a substantial proportion of the internet intervention (ie, 80% of the modules) will be conducted. Missing data will be handled via multiple imputation, using a multilevel imputation model to account for clustering.

Secondary outcomes will be analysed analogously to the primary outcome, using random effect regression models as appropriate for the respective type of data. Potential onset and remission of incident depression will be compared between study groups based on incidence rate ratios using multilevel Poisson regression. No interim analysis is planned for effectiveness or futility. Exploratory moderator analyses will be used to investigate whether pretreatment patient characteristics are associated with differential treatment effectiveness. Potential moderators include sociodemographic (eg, age) and clinical (eg, insomnia severity) variables. Exploratory mediator analyses will be employed to examine potential mechanisms of change. Among potential mediators are sleep- related (eg, DBAS) and intervention- related variables (eg, working alliance).\nEconomic evaluation The economic evaluation will be performed from the societal and public healthcare perspective. Two multilevel models (MLMs) will be specified, one for costs and one for effects, which take into account the hierarchical structure of the data. MLMs will be combined with cluster bootstrapping, which is recommended for resampling clustered data.76 Across the four study groups, mean costs and QALYs will be compared with assess if any of the treatments are less effective and more expensive than the other treatments. If so, incremental cost- effectiveness ratios (ICERs) will not be estimated in relation to that treatment.77 Otherwise, ICERs will be estimated by calculating the difference in costs between two treatment options divided by the difference in effectiveness of these two treatment options. We will bootstrap seemingly unrelated regression equation models to generate 5000 simulations of cost and effect pairs while allowing for correlated residuals of the cost and effect equations and adjusting for potential confounders.78 The joint uncertainty surrounding costs and effects will be summarised using cost- effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs) based on a net benefit regression framework.79 CEACs show the probability of an intervention being cost effective in comparison with the alternatives for a range of different willingness- to- pay thresholds. For patients insured by BARMER, the validity of the TiC- P will be assessed with secondary data from the health insurance.\nQualitative interviews Qualitative interviews of patients, GPs and e- coaches will be used to assess barriers and supporting factors of the stepped care model. The sample size will be determined according to the principle of theoretical saturation. Thus, data collection will continue until no further insights can be gained from additional interviews.80 81 Following the principles of theoretical sampling, for the stakeholder group patients, cases will be deliberately selected based\non the following criteria: remitters/non- remitters; male/ female; lower/higher age; intervention- adherers (defined as completing more than 80% of the intervention within 12 weeks)/non- adherers. Additionally, care will be taken to include participants from all three IGs and the TAU group. Given the limited number of GPs and e- coaches, all participants of these stakeholder groups will be invited to the interviews.\nFor each stakeholder group, a semi- structured interview schedule will be prepared. The content of the interview schedules will be primarily based on the dimensions of the Hierarchical Model of Health Service Quality (ie, interpersonal quality, technical quality, environmental quality, administrative quality)82 and will be supplemented by other relevant dimensions (eg, therapeutic alliance, adverse effects). The questions aim at exploring acceptance, perceived effectiveness, usage behaviour, barriers, facilitators and transferability into routine care as well as adverse effects. Interviews will be 60\u201390 min long and will be conducted by trained and supervised psychologists. Recordings will be transcribed according to the rules for computer- assisted evaluation.83 Following the principles of qualitative content analysis by Kuckartz,83 text units will be systematised and classified following an inductivedeductive approach.
