            "text": "would have benefits across the SDGs Those urging world leaders to take action on inequality should study why earlier efforts did not translate to changes in policy.\nL ast month, researchers from 67 nations wrote an open letter to United Nations secretary-general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres and World Bank president Ajay Banga, urging them to \u201credouble efforts to address rising extreme inequality\u201d. The move was\nmotivated, in part, by the lack of progress on the 10th of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Nature is examining each goal in a series of editorials.\nThe aim of SDG 10 is to \u201creduce inequality within and among countries\u201d. That means narrowing the difference between the incomes of the richest and the poorest, on both a national and an international level. The goal also proposes ensuring equality of opportunity. Unfortunately, the world is clearly failing to meet SDG 10. The letter\u2019s authors go further, saying that the goal is being \u201clargely ignored\u201d.\nThis is not the first time that researchers have tried to focus the world\u2019s attention on inequality. For a better chance of success, the letter\u2019s authors should study what happened to previous efforts \u2014 in particular, the 2009 publication of the influential text The Spirit Level by epidemiologists Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett. They showed that reducing inequality has a cascade of benefits, from better health to lower crime rates and better educational outcomes.\nThe book was a sensation. It was read avidly and quoted widely; its findings referenced by David Cameron, later UK prime minister, and Christine Lagarde, now president of the European Central Bank, among others. Yet despite being widely respected, the authors\u2019 careful synthesis of evidence on the benefits of equality \u2014 and subsequent invites to give talks and policy advice worldwide \u2014 did not change governments\u2019 approaches to inequality.\nNot all of the targets for SDG 10 are failing. Overall income inequality between countries is dropping. Another target, to reduce the costs incurred by migrant workers sending remittances to their families, is also on its way to being met \u2014 although not by the SDGs\u2019 2030 deadline.\nBut income inequality within countries is rising, as measured by the Gini index, a measure of income distribution across a population. Globally, in the 15 years to 2019, economic output in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) roughly doubled, but the share of economic output earned by the workers producing the goods and services behind the increase fell from 54.1% in 2004 to 52.6% in 2019.\nSo what has gone wrong?
