    "abstractText": "Pain is a very unpleasant experience that makes life extremely uncomfortable. The histamine H4 receptor (H4R) is a promising target for the treatment of inflammatory and immune diseases, as well as pain. H4R ligands have demonstrated analgesic effects in a variety of pain models, including inflammatory pain. Continuing the search for active H4R ligands among the alkyl derivatives of 1,3,5-triazine, we obtained 19 new compounds in two series: acyclic (I) and aliphatic (II). In vitro pharmacological evaluation showed their variable affinity for H4R. The majority of compounds showed a moderate affinity for this receptor (Ki > 100 nM), while all compounds tested in \u00df-arrestin and cAMP assays showed antagonistic activity. The most promising, compound 6, (4-(cyclopentylmethyl)-6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1,3,5-triazin-2-amine; Ki = 63 nM) was selected for further in vitro evaluation: blood-brain barrier permeability (PAMPA assay; Pe = 12.26 \u00d7 10\u22126 cm/s) and toxicity tests (HepG2 and SH-5YSY cells; no toxicity up to 50 \u03bcM). Next, compound 6 tested in vivo in a carrageenan-induced inflammatory pain model showed anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects (strongest at 50 mg/kg i.p.). Furthermore, in a histamineand chloroquine-induced pruritus model, compound 6 at a dose of 25 mg/kg i.p. and 50 mg/kg i.p., respectively, reduced the number of scratch bouts. Thus, compound 6 is a promising ligand for further studies.",

Introduction\nHistamine is an important biogenic amine and endogenous neurotransmitter that has a number of important functions in the body, including the mediation of inflammatory and allergic reactions, playing an important role in wakefulness or sleep, and involvement in the sensation of pain [1,2]. In the CNS, histamine has antinociceptive activity while it has nociceptive in the periphery [3]. Histamine acts through four histamine receptors (H1\u2013H4) that differ in their location, roles, and sensitivity to endogenous agonists [1,2]. Histamine H4 receptor (H4R) is located mainly in cells and tissues related to inflammatory state, such as eosinophils, mast cells, monocytes, lymphocytes, and macrophages [2,4]. H4R plays a significant role in the immune response that influences the inflammation process. Activation of H4R induces chemotaxis, not only of mast cells, eosinophils, and dendritic cells [5,6], but also migration of regulatory T-cells [7] and microglia [8]. In human mast cells, H4R activation induces the release of inflammatory mediators, such as\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4199. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28104199 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4199 2 of 25\nTh2 cytokines (IL-4 IL-5 IL-13), pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1beta), immunoregulatory cytokine IL-10 and chemokines (IL-8, MCP-1) [9]. In some experiments, microglial H4R activation led to the production of pro-inflammatory mediators [10,11] but in other experiments inhibited LPS-induced IL-1\u03b2 production [8]. Furthermore, H4R induces the secretion of IL-16 from CD4+ T cells [12] and increases the secretion of INF-\u03b3 and IL-4 from NK cells [13]. H4R expression was also found to change in the presence of immune mediators [14,15]. The presence of H4Rs in the CNS has been controversial and discussed by the research community in recent years [16\u201319]. Some reports indicate the presence of H4R on sensory nerves in the dorsal root ganglia and in the spinal cord [20\u201322]. The location of H4R coincides with the pathways of pain transmission (Figure 1) [23,24], supporting the modulatory role of H4R in this process [25,26].\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 27\ndendritic cells [5,6], but also migration of regulatory T-cells [7] and microglia [8].

Both H4R agonists [22,27\u201329] and antagonists [30\u201338] showed antinociceptive effects. H4R agonists induced analgesic activity when administered intrathecally [28] or intracerebroventricularly [22] which was\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4199 3 of 25\nperformed to measure the effect that comes from the central, not peripheral, H4R.

Furthermore, JNJ7777120 acted as an antagonist in in vivo studies and in primary cells [4]. H4R is G protein-coupled receptor (Gi/o) and upon stimulation activates a specific G-protein-dependent pathway and/or independent (\u03b2-arrestin) elements of the signal transduction cascade (Figure 3A) [50,51]. Ligands binding to this receptor may represent balanced activity towards all pathways (Figure 3B) or show preference toward one of them (Figure 3C) [52]. This unique behaviour is called functional selectivity or biased signalling. Moreover, H4R signalling pathways depend on cell background. In recombinant systems, H4R activation inhibits adenylyl cyclase activity, resulting in a decrease in intracellular cAMP [53,54], while in some cell types (i.e., mouse mast cells), endogenous activation of H4R led to Ca2+ mobilization, without influence on cAMP (in Gi protein-dependent manner proved by pertussis toxin) [5]. Functional selectivity with one signalling branch is proposed to be responsible for therapeutic effects, while the other signalling could cause unwanted side effects [55]. Thus, from the point of view of drug screening, it is not sufficient to rely only on one functional assay [49]. In our previous studies, TR7 (Figure 2) was shown to be an H4R antagonist in the cAMP accumulation assay of cAMP [56] and the Ca2+ efflux aequorin-based assay [57], while it showed agonist activity in the adhesion of eosinophils to the endothelium assay [57].\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 27\n[40].

The reaction was repeated three times but the product was the same every time. In these cases, \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated esters reacted via the Michael addition reaction with sodium methoxide and produced \u03b2-methoxylated derivatives. Analysis of mass spectrometry confirmed the formation of this product with a parent ion [M + H]+ = 267.23 with one greater than the theoretical mass of M = 266.35 (Scheme 2). This molecular mass was 33 greater than the mass of the expected structure (Scheme 2). Further, 1H NMR and COSY NMR spectrum for compound 13 (Supplementary Materials) confirmed the formation of the predicted structure. A similar observation was made by Kisanga et al. [63] who also obtained ethyl 3-methoxybutanoate, in methanol but in the presence of the catalytic amount of the nonionic strong base proazaphosphatrane (P(i-BuNCH2CH2)3N), which further underwent in that condition transesterification.\nTable 1.

In Vitro Phar acological S udies 2.3.1 Histamine H4 Receptor Affinity\nThe affi ity of c mpounds 2\u201320 for hH4R was evaluat d in a bind ng assay as previu ly d scribed [44]. [3H]Histamin was use as a radioligand and hH4R was expressed in Sf 9 cells with G protein G\u03b1i2 and G\u03b21\u03b32 subun ts. The pharmacological results represented s Ki values a listed in Table 1 (f r alicyclic deriv tives) and Table 2 (for aliphatic\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4199 8 of 25\nderivatives). The compounds showed variable affinities for hH4R, ranging from good (Ki < 100 nM) to very weak (Ki > 4000 nM). Results depended on the substituent in the four positions of a triazine (a main structure). In the group of alicyclic derivatives (2\u20139; Table 1), the affinity was related to the type of ring and its distance from the main structure. Compounds with 4- and 6-membered alicyclic moiety (3, 5) had better affinity than 3-membered (2) opposite to the 5-membered (4), which showed a much weaker affinity. The introduction of a methylene linker between the alicyclic ring (5- and 6-membered) and the triazine scaffold increased the affinity for hH4R (6 vs. 4 and TR-AF-49 vs. 5). The use of a larger adamantane ring resulted in a significant decrease in affinity (9 vs. TR-AF-49). Additionally, the presence of an unsaturated bond in the rings (7, 8) led to a lower affinity for these ligands. Among this group of alicyclic derivatives (2\u20139), two compounds (6 and 7) achieved higher binding affinity than the lead structure TR-AF-49. In the group of aliphatic derivatives (10\u201320; Table 2), the affinity was influenced by the presence of a methyl branch and/or a double bond in the main chain. Unbranched saturated aliphatic derivatives (10, 19) showed better affinity than branched compounds (11\u201314). An introduction of the methyl substituent into the butyl chain in the \u03b1- or \u00dfpositions to the triazine ring resulted in a decrease in affinity (10 vs. 11 vs. 12). On the contrary, the presence of this substituent in the \u03b3-position had little effect on affinity (14 vs. 10). The introduction of a double bond regardless of the position caused a decrease in affinity (10 vs. 15 vs. 16 or 19 vs. 20). In contrast, the presence of this bond in compounds with branching at the \u03b1- and \u00df-positions slightly increased receptor affinity (17 vs. 11 and 18 vs. 12). Thus, the presence of the double bond was profitable for the branched derivatives and unprofitable for straight-chain compounds. The exchange of a carbon atom for an oxygen atom similar to the series described earlier [61] led to a significant decrease in affinity (12 vs. 13). In this group, none of the compounds achieved the high binding affinity of the lead structure TR-AF-49. In comparison with our previous work [61] where an elongation of the chain from methyl to propyl resulted in an increase in hH4R affinity (Ki from 2664 nM to 185 nM), present results showed that the butyl chain is optimal as further increasing to the pentyl one caused a decrease in affinity. To sum up, the introduced modifications to the lead TR-AF-49 gave the very potent compound 6 (Ki = 63 nM). This compound showed higher affinity than thioperamide but worse than JNJ7777120 (Ki = 106 nM, and Ki = 32 nM, respectively [64]).\n2.3.2. Functional Characterization in \u03b2-Arrestin Recruitment Assay\n\u03b2-Arrestin recruitment assay was performed only for the ligands that had Ki < 1 \u00b5M in the binding assay (except compound 3: Ki = 1247 nM) (Tables 1 and 2). Compounds were tested using LiveBLAzerTM assay and Tango-H4-bla U2OS cells, allowing the estimation of the percentage of \u03b2-arrestin recruitment in response to tested treatments. Compounds were tested in agonist and antagonist mode of the assay and all showed antagonistic properties. For alicyclic derivatives (Table 1) we observed a similar structure\u2013activity relationship as in the case of hH4R binding affinity evaluation: 4-, 5- and 6-membered alicyclic moieties showed better activity in the \u03b2-arrestin recruitment assay than 3-membered (3\u20135 vs. 2) compound. The presence of a methylene linker between the alicyclic ring and the triazine scaffold improved the activity (6 vs. 4 and TR-AF-49 vs. 5). Addition of a double bond slightly improved activity only in the cyclohexylene derivative (compare TR-AF-49 vs. 8). The 5-membered ring compounds, 6 and 7, (without or with the double bond) most potently blocked the histamine-induced \u03b2-arrestin recruitment. In that particular assay conditions, these compounds performed better (IC50 < 15 nM) than JNJ7777120 (IC50 = 56 nM). For aliphatic derivatives (Table 2) addition of the methyl group in the \u03b2- or \u03b3-position, or elongation of the carbon chain (from butyl to pentyl) resulted in more active antagonists (12, 14, 19 vs. 10). Presence of the unsaturated bond at the chain diminished the activity\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4199 9 of 25\n(10 vs. 16, 12 vs. 18, 19 vs. 20). The most active compound 14 with an IC50 of 24 nM also showed better activity than JNJ7777120 (IC50 = 56 nM).\n2.3.3. Functional Characterization in cAMP Accumulation Assay\nIntrinsic activity via the G\u03b1 subunit was measured using a LANCE Ultra cAMP detection kit and CHO-K1 cells stably expressing hH4R. Adenyl cyclase was stimulated by forskolin (10 \u00b5M). Histamine (140 nM) was used with the tested ligands in the antagonist mode of the assay. Only compounds with binding Ki values < 1 \u00b5M (except compound 3: Ki = 1247 nM) were tested in this assay. Among the alicyclic derivatives (2\u20139; Table 1) SAR of cAMP accumulation directly reflected the binding affinity (see Section 2.3.1). Aliphatic derivatives (10\u201320; Table 2) showed a similar SAR pattern as compounds in the \u03b2-arrestin recruitment assay (see Section 2.3.2). The addition of methyl group in \u03b2- and \u03b3-positions of the main chain increased activity, while the introduction of methyl substituent in \u03b1-position decreased antagonist activity (12, 14 and 11 vs. 10). Elongation of the aliphatic chain had no influence on antagonist activity towards cAMP pathway (10 vs. 20). The most active antagonist in both series, compound 6 (IC50 = 10 nM) showed better activity than JNJ7777120 (IC50 = 49 nM) tested in the same conditions.\n2.3.4. Comparison of Intrinsic Activities\nIn the next step, we decided to compare the intrinsic activities of compounds toward two transduction pathways. Because both functional assays were conducted in different conditions, we first calculated Kb values using the Leff\u2013Dougall variant of the Cheng\u2013 Prusoff equation (Equation (1)) [65].\nKb = IC50/ ((2 + ([Ag]/[EC50]) n)1/2 \u2212 1) (1)\nwhere: IC50, concentration of antagonist that inhibits agonist response by 50%; [Ag], concentration of agonist employed in the assay; [EC50], agonist EC50 value in the assay; n, Hill slope of the concentration\u2013response curve of the agonist. To compare the two pathways, we transformed the data to pKb values and calculated the differences in pKb values between the two pathways (Equation (2)).\nBias factor = pKb \u03b2\u2212arr \u2212 pKb cAMP (2)\nwhere: pKb \u2212 log from Kb values; \u03b2-arr, \u03b2-arrestin pathway; cAMP, cAMP pathway. Calculated pKb values and bias factors are presented in Table 3. A bias factor above 0 suggests a ligand bias towards the \u03b2-arrestin pathway while a bias factor below 0 suggests a ligand bias toward the cAMP pathway.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4199 10 of 25\nTable 3.

Pain and pruritus are distinct unpl asant sensations, but, in many ways,\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4199 12 of 25\nthey are closely related. Both sensations share many integral similarities such as largely overlapping mediators and receptors [69,70]. It has been reported that H4R antagonists effectively attenuate experimental pruritus [71]. The above-mentioned data encouraged us to test compound 6 in animal models of inflammatory pain and itch.\n2.4.1. Antinociceptive Activity of Compound 6 in Formalin Test\nA commonly used screening method to test new molecules with analgesic potential is the formalin test. Local injection of formalin induces two phases of the nociceptive response. The early phase (I) is associated with immediate activation of the nociceptors mainly dependent on chemical stimulation of TRPA1 receptors and is related rather to acute neurogenic pain. The late phase (II) is the result of tissue damage, a subsequent inflammatory response, and sensitisation of the spinal reflex circuits. Furthermore, it has been suggested that formalin induces pathological changes that resemble those observed in nerve injury and neuropathic pain [72]. The biphasic response and a plethora of mechanisms involved in the nociceptive response to formalin make the formalin test a valuable tool in the assessment of the analgesic efficacy of a variety of compounds. The administration of compound 6 to mice did not significantly affect the duration of the nociceptive response in the acute phase of the formalin test [F(3,30) = 1.547, p = 0.22] (Figure 7), but at the doses of 50 mg/kg and 75 mg/kg it significantly attenuated the paw licking or biting behaviour in the late phase [F(3,30) = 2.955, p < 0.01]. The results show that compound 6 has no significant influence on acute pain but effectively attenuates inflammatory pain. Interestingly, the analgesic effect had no dose-dependent character. The most potent effect was observed at a dose of 50 mg/kg (44.02% of the control group). Administration of a higher dose of 75 mg/kg resulted in a less pronounced effect (56.62% of the control group). This u-shaped response is often observed in analgesic agents, and in this case, it may be the result of the fact that H4R plays a different role in inflammatory cells and neurones. The blockade of H4Rs expressed in inflammatory cells results in antiinflammatory and analgesic effects. On the contrary, the activation of neuronal H4Rs leads to analgesia [73]. We hypothesize that the higher dose of compound 6 could antagonize neuronal H4Rs in a more pronounced way than the lower dose, thus attenuating the overall analgesic effect.\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 12 of 27\nways, they are closely related.

To evaluate the influence of compound 6 on acute inflammation, such as oedema and hyperalgesia, we tested it in the carrageenan-induced inflammation model in rats. Subplantar injection of carrageenan significantly induced oedema (F(5,100) = 31.0, p < 0.0001). The paw volume increased from 0.92 \u00b1 0.03 cm3 before carrageenan injection to the values of 1.36 \u00b1 0.03 cm3, 1.64 \u00b1 0.03 cm3, 1.95 \u00b1 0.04 cm3, 1.98 \u00b1 0.07 cm3 and 1.98 \u00b1 0.07 cm3, respectively 1, 2, 3, 6, and 24 h after injection, which corresponds to the increase by 48.9%, 79.3%, 113.0%, 115.2% and 114.1%, respectively. The time course of the development of rat paw oedema (Figure 8A) shows that compound 6 significantly reduced paw oedema (F3,20) = 11.33, p = 0.0001). The effect was dose-dependent, and the administration of the most potent dose of 75 mg/kg also resulted in the paw volume increase but only by 22.1%, 46.3%, 72.6%, 76.8% and 55.8%. As oedema is one of the most significant symptoms of inflammation resulting from the release of inflammatory mediators, we may conclude that compound 6 has some anti-inflammatory activity. Experiments with analgesimeter and Plantar test apparatus showed that carrageenan induces significant mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia (F(3, 15) = 40.48, p < 0.001 and F(5, 25) = 9.85, p < 0.001). The response to mechanical stimuli was observed as the pain withdrawal threshold (Figure 8B) decreased from the value of 138.33 \u00b1 1.05 g (baseline) before carrageenan injection to the value of 120.83 \u00b1 2.0 g (87.3% of the baseline) 3 h after injection, 125.83 \u00b1 2.51 (90.9% of the baseline) 6 h after injection, and 124.17 \u00b1 2.0 (89.7% of the baseline). Compound 6 at the dose of 50 mg/kg significantly increased the pain withdrawal threshold to 122.1%, 119.5% and 111.7% of the baseline. Whereas at the dose of 75 mg/kg compound 6 significantly increased the pain withdrawal threshold to 107.5%, 113.2% and 113.8% of the baseline. The results obtained confirmed its analgesic activity in mechanical inflammatory hyperalgesia. The interesting fact is that the effect had a long-lasting character and was observed even after 24 h after compound administration. We claim that the effect may result from the inhibition of the release of inflammatory mediators and subsequent inhibition of peripheral and central sensitization. In the vehicletreated group, the response for thermal stimuli observed as the paw withdrawal latency (Figure 8C) decreased from the value of 11.90 \u00b1 0.98 s (baseline) before carrageenan injection to the values of 7.43 \u00b1 1.08 s (62.44% of the baseline), 7.75 \u00b1 0.89 s (65.13% of the baseline), 5.43 \u00b1 0.76 s (45.63 % of the baseline), 5.45 \u00b1 0.70 s (45.80% of the baseline) and 8.90 \u00b1 1.06 s (74.79% of the baseline) 1, 2, 3, 6 and 24 h after the injection, respectively. Compound 6 only at a dose of 75 mg/kg significantly (F(3,20) = 25.22, p < 0.0001) increased paw withdrawal latency. The effect was not as persistent as in the mechanical hyperalgesia and was observed only 1, 2 and 3 h after induction of inflammation. The administration of 75 mg/kg increased the latency of paw withdrawal to 129.5%, 103.6% and 86.3% of baseline 1, 2 and 3 after inflammation induction, respectively. The results (the level of pain reactivity over-reaching baseline) show that compound 6 attenuates inflammatory hypersensitivity and induces analgesia. Taking into account all the results of the analgesic activity of compound 6, we propose the hypothesis that its anti-inflammatory properties resulting from the antagonism of H4R are central to the overall in vivo analgesic profile of the compound. As an H4R antagonist, compound 6 can reduce inflammation by inhibiting the release of inflammatory mediators from immune cells decreasing the migration of immune cells to the site of inflammation. It may subsequently inhibit the process of inflammatory sensitization of the peripheral nerve endings and synapses in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. The results of the formalin test support the hypothesis. On the one hand, compound 6 did not affect the first phase, which resulted from the direct stimulation of nociceptors, proving that this compound had no impact on processes such as transformation and transduction. On the other hand, compound 6 significantly inhibited the late phase, which depends at least partly on inflammatory sensitization. Significant anti-inflammatory activity was additionally confirmed in the carrageenan-induced inflammatory model, where compound 6 reduced oedema formation and inflammatory hyperalgesia.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4199 14 of 25 Molecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 14 of 27\npose the hypothesis that its anti-inflammatory properties resulting from the antagonism of H4R are central to the overall in vivo analgesic profile of the compound.

The first type results from the stimulation of histamine H1 receptors (H1Rs) on itch-mediating primary sensory neurons. The second one results from the stimulation of distinct types of ion channels and receptors such as Mas-related G\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4199 15 of 25\nprotein-coupled receptors (Mrgprs), protease-activated receptors (PARs), bile acid receptors (TGR5), toll-like receptors (TLRs), and transient receptor potential subfamily V1/A1 (TRPV1/A1). An example of histamine-independent itch is the sensation induced by the MrgprA3 agonist\u2013chloroquine (CQ) [74]. Classical antihistamine agents, which are H1Rs antagonists, attenuate histamine-dependent itch, but not the histamine-independent [75]. We tested compound 6 in two different pruritus mice models to assess its potential to affect histamine-dependent and histamine-independent itch (Figure 9).

Histamine H1R antagonist pyrilamine (used as reference ligand) at the dose of 10 mg/kg significantly reduced scratching behaviour to the value of 28.56 \u00b1 3.55 scratch bouts. Intradermal injection of the CQ solution resulted in robust scratching behaviour manifested as 72.20 \u00b1 11.59 scratch bouts during the 30 min observation. A single administration of compound 6 at doses 25 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg significantly decreased the number of scratch bouts but the effects of doses of 6.25 mg/kg and 12.5 mg/kg were not statistically significant (F(5,44) = 19.14, p < 0.0001). The most effective dose of compound 6 was 50 mg/kg, which decreased the number of scratch bouts to 18.14 \u00b1 3.48 (25.12% of the control value) whereas pyrilamine (at the dose of 10 mg/kg) did not significantly reduce scratching behaviour. When comparing the activity of the tested in both used models, it should be noted that the efficacy (higher maximal effect) and potency (lower doses needed to obtain the same result) of the compound were better in histamine-induced pruritus. Nevertheless, compound 6 was also active in histamine-independent itch, which contrasts with the activity of pyrilamine representing a commonly used drug in the treatment of pruritus. This H1R antagonist showed activity in histamine-induced itch but was inactive in CQ-induced itch. The wide spectrum of antipruritic activity of compound 6 is very promising, considering that histamine-independent itch is still a crucial clinical problem in pruritus treatment.\n3.

After 24 h of incubation, the cells were checked under the microscope and the dilutions of tested compounds were prepared and added to the wells. In agonist mode compounds were added to the wells and plates were placed in the incubator (HERAcell240, Heraeus, Hanau, Germany) for 16 h. In antagonist mode, first, the compounds were added to the wells, plates were incubated for 30 min, then histamine solution (corresponding to EC80\u2014500 nM) was added and plates were put in the incubator for 16 h. After this time \u03b2-lactamase substrate mixture was prepared and added to wells (8 \u00b5L/well). Cells were incubated for 2 h at room temperature in the dark then the signal was read using an EnSpire microplate reader (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA). Drawing of dose-dependent curves and IC50 calculation for compounds were made using GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).\n3.2.3. cAMP Accumulation Assay\nIntrinsic activity in G protein-dependent pathway was measured with homogenous TR-FRET immunoassay, using LANCE Ultra cAMP kit and CHO-K1 H4R cell line or \u03b3irradiated recombinant CHO-K1 H4R cells (all from PerkinElmer). If frozen CHO-K1 H4R cells were used cells had been thawed in a 37 \u25e6C water bath and placed in the culture flask with DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10 % FBS the day before the experiment. If the CHO-K1 H4R cell line was used it had been cultivated in DMEM/F12 10% FBS 400 \u00b5g/mL geneticin and passaged three times a week. On the experiment day cells were detached using Tryple, collected, centrifuged and resuspended in stimulation buffer (HBSS, 100 mM RO-201724, 5 mM HEPES, 0.1% BSA, pH 7.4). The antagonist activity was measured in a white, opaque, 384-well microplate (PerkinElmer) with a total volume of 20 \u00b5L. Cells (1000 cells/well) were incubated with forskolin (10 \u00b5M), histamine (140 nM) and tested antagonists (0.003\u2013100 \u00b5M) for 30 min at room temperature. After incubation, 5 \u00b5L of europium chelate-labelled cAMP tracer and 5 \u00b5l of ULight-labelled anti-cAMP mAb working solutions were added, mixed and incubated for 1 h. TR-FRET signal was read using a microplate reader (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA).\n3.2.4. PAMPA Assay The GentestTM PAMPA Plate System, purchased from Corning (Tewksbury, MA, USA), was used for permeability evaluation. Caffeine (a reference) and the compound tested were dissolved in DMSO (10 mM stocks) and after dilution to 200 \u00b5M in PBS (pH 7.4), added to donor wells. Then, after incubation for 5 h at room temperature, concentrations of tested compounds in donor and acceptor wells were estimated by the mass spectra (LC/MS) method as described previously [68]. The UPLC/MS Waters ACQUITYTM TQD system\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4199 20 of 25\nwith the TQ Detector (Waters, Milford, CT, USA) was used for this detection. The assay was performed in triplicate. The permeability value (Pe) was calculated using the formula described by Chen et al. [76].\n3.2.5. Toxicity Evaluation The hepatoma cell line HepG2 (ATCC\u00ae HB-8065TM) and SH-SY5Y CRL-2266 neuroblastoma cell line were used to evaluate the toxicity of tested compounds. Tests were conducted as described previously [77]. CellTiter 96\u00ae Aqueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI, USA). Compounds were tested at 7 concentrations (0.78, 1.56, 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 50 \u00b5M). Cell viability was determined after incubation with compounds for 24 h (HepG2) or 48 h (SH-SY5Y). Each experiment was performed twice in triplicate.\n3.3. In Vivo Studies 3.3.1. Animals\nThe experiments were carried out on adult male Albino Swiss mice (CD-1, 18\u201325 g) and male Wistar rats (Krf:(WI) WU), 180\u2013250 g). The animals were housed in plastic cages in a room at a constant temperature of 20 \u00b1 2 \u25e6C, under a light/dark (12:12) cycle and had free access to a standard pellet diet and water. The experimental groups consisted of 6\u201312 animals, all the animals were used only once and they were killed by cervical dislocation immediately after the assay. The rats were previously anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg). The minimum number of animals was used needed to obtain definite and normally distributed results with the utilized test. Behavioural measures were scored by trained observers, which were blind to experimental conditions. The treatment of laboratory animals in the present study was in full accordance with the respective Polish regulations. All procedures were conducted according to the guidelines of ICLAS (International Council on Laboratory Animal Science) and approved by the Local Ethics Committee of the Jagiellonian University in Krak\u00f3w (105/2016 and 666/2022).\n3.3.2. Formalin Test\nThe procedure used was essentially the same as that described previously [77,78]. Briefly, the pain was induced by the intraplantar injection of 20 \u00b5L of 2.5% formalin solution into the right hind paw of the mice. The total time (in s) spent on licking the injected paw during periods of 0\u20135 min (early phase, neurogenic) and 15\u201330 min (late phase, inflammatory) was measured and was considered as an indicator of nociceptive behaviour. Before formalin injection different groups of mice were treated i.p. with vehicle (10 mL/kg, negative control) and the dose\u2013response of the investigated compound.\n3.3.3. Carrageenan-Induced Inflammatory Pain and Oedema\nThe procedure used was described previously [35]. Briefly, the inflammation and paw oedema was induced by subplantar injection of 0.1 mL of 1% carrageenan (made in PBS) into the right hind paw of the rat. The paw volume was measured by the dislocation of the water column of the plethysmometer (Plethysmometer 7140, Ugo Basile). The hyperalgesic response to mechanical stimuli was measured using Analgesy Meter 37215, Ugo Basile. The intensity of the applied force, in grams, was recorded when the paw was withdrawn (withdrawal threshold). Moreover, the hyperalgesic response to thermal stimuli was determined by using a plantar test apparatus (Commat Ltd., Ankara, Turkey). The latency to the heat stimulus was automatically recorded. Three subsequent applications of the heating stimulus were done, separated by 1- to 2-min intervals, and the mean of these measures was taken.\n3.3.4. Histamine- and Chloroquine-Induced Pruritus The surface (around 2 cm2) of the mice\u2019s nape was shaved at least 2 days prior to experiments. On the day of the experiment, mice were individually placed in plastic\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4199 21 of 25\nchambers (15 \u00d7 15 \u00d7 30 cm) and after the 30 min habituation period, they were given an intradermal (i.d.) injection of histamine dihydrochloride (10 \u00b5mol/site) or chloroquine (CQ, 200 \u00b5g/site), which were dissolved in physiological saline and administrated in the constant volume of 20 \u00b5L. Immediately after the injection, scratching (series of movements considered as a single scratching bout) of the injected site by the hind paw was counted for 60 min or 30 min after histamine and CQ administration, respectively [77\u201380]. Before pruritogens injection different groups of mice were treated i.p. with vehicle (10 mL/kg, negative control) or the dose\u2013response of investigated compound.\n4. Conclusions\nIn two series (alicyclic and aliphatic), nineteen new alkylaminopiperazinyl-1,3,5triazines were obtained and pharmacologically evaluated. Most compounds (eleven) showed comparable or weaker affinities for hH4R (100 < Ki < 600 nM) than the lead structure TR-AF-49 (Ki = 160 nM). Two compounds (6 and 7) had good affinities with Ki values below 100 nM whereas for six compounds very low affinities were observed (Ki > 1000 nM). The summary of SAR analysis is shown in Figure 10. Compounds with substituents such as a cyclobutyl (3), a butyl (10) or a 3-methylbutyl (14) had a comparable affinity to the lead TR-AF-49 (Ki ~ 200 nM). The introduction of a lower ring (a cyclopentyl instead of a cyclohexyl) increased hH4R affinity (Ki < 100 nM) and compound 6 is the most potent compound in both series. Other changes especially in the alkyl chain led to a decrease in affinity. Molecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 23 of 27\nFigure 10. SAR analysis of hH4R affinities of alkyl derivatives of 4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1,3,5triazin-2-amines.\nAll the compounds tested in functional assays (\u03b2-arrestin recruitment, cAMP accu-\nmulation) in the agonist and antagonist modes showed only antagonistic effects. Although the mode of action was the same (antagonistic), different behaviour was observed toward the tested signalling pathways. Most of the compounds favoured the \u03b2-arrestin pathway. Compound 6 showed the highest antagonist activity compared to the other compounds tested and the reference ligand JNJ7777120. The analysis of calculated bias coefficients clearly showed the balanced activity of this compound toward the cAMP and \u03b2-arrestin pathways. Further in vitro studies of compound 6 demonstrated low neurotoxicity to SHSY5Y cells and hepatotoxicity to HepG2 cells. The PAMPA assay allowed us to estimate the high capacity of compound 6 to penetrate BBB. In in vivo studies, we found that compound 6, decreased nociceptive response in some animal models of inflammatory pain also attenuating inflammatory oedema. Furthermore, we showed that the tested compound decreased scratching behaviour in mice in different models of itch. However, compound 6 showed better efficacy and potency in decreasing scratching behaviour than in decreasing the nociceptive response. This observed anti-inflammatory effect is not surprising as H4R is located in cells and tissues associated with inflammation. Our previous studies showed that the aryl derivatives of 1,3,5-triazine (e.g., TR7) tested in in vivo models of inflammation induced by carrageenan or zymosan decreased the production of inflammatory cytokines such as TNFa and IL-1b and reduced the production of reactive oxygen species [35].
