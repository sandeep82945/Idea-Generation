Online classes are a learning experience as a mode of instruction and their characteristics have met the requirements of various learners [2].

Education organizations are in a prime part in enhancing the effectiveness of online learning by assisting teachers, scholars, and content refinement [4]. -e union government has focused on ICT at tertiary level. For better execution of academic shift (from traditional pedagogy to online system), consequences of shift are required to be addressed [5].\nOnline learning is going to be instrumental for the college and university studies [6]. Considerable work has been done to check the feasibility of online classes for various parameters [7]. Several papers proposed the need of supporting academic organizations for improvement in the results of online learning [8]. Literature is deficient in case of dealing with the challenges of empowerment of online instructors and integrating techniques in methodological inquiry. Moreover, the past related work on online learning is hardly vocal about the critical optimization of competencybased teacher learning pattern [9].
