Exploration of Other Dye Families: The study focused on the degradation of anionic and cationic dyes, namely methyl orange (MO) and rhodamine b (Rhb). Future research could explore the photocatalytic degradation efficiencies of g-C3N4 for other families of dyes, including nonionic dyes and those that are commonly found in industrial waste but not covered in this study. This would help in broadening the applicability of g-C3N4 in wastewater treatment across different industries.

Advanced g-C3N4 Composites: Building upon the success of using g-C3N4 in a synergistic system with H2O2 and Na2S2O8, future studies could focus on creating composites of g-C3N4 with other materials (e.g., metals, metal oxides, or other 2D materials) to further enhance its photocatalytic activity, stability, and efficiency under visible light irradiation. Investigating the effects of doping or compositing with materials that have narrower band gaps could be particularly promising for improving light absorption and charge separation.

Mechanism and Kinetics Studies: The study provided insights into the degradation mechanism, highlighting the roles of ·OH and ·O2− radicals. Future research could delve deeper into the mechanistic aspects of the photocatalytic process, including detailed kinetics analyses. This could involve studying the intermediate products of dye degradation, mapping out the reaction pathways, and understanding how different factors (pH, temperature, light intensity) influence the rate and efficiency of degradation.

Real Wastewater Treatment: While the study demonstrated the efficacy of g-C3N4 in degrading dyes in a controlled laboratory setting, real wastewater contains a complex mixture of pollutants. Future research could focus on applying g-C3N4-based photocatalysis in the treatment of real wastewater samples. This would help in assessing the practical applicability of the technology, including challenges related to scalability, the presence of other contaminants, and the impact on water quality parameters beyond dye removal.

Life Cycle Assessment and Sustainability Studies: To fully understand the environmental impact of deploying g-C3N4-based photocatalysis for water treatment, future studies could conduct life cycle assessments (LCAs) of the photocatalyst production, use, and disposal processes. Additionally, research into regenerating and recycling the photocatalyst after its useful life could contribute to making this technology more sustainable and economically viable for large-scale applications.
