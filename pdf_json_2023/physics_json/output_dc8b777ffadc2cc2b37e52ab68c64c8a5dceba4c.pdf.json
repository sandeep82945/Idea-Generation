For example, traditional porous carbons, like activated carbons, are synthesized by carbonization of an organic precursor below 1273 K, followed by chemical or physical activation at 873\u20131173 K.6,7 Templated nanoporous carbons are generally synthesized by carbonization of the mixture of organic precursor and an inorganic template, typically below 1273 K, followed by template removal.8 Furthermore, post-synthesis heat treatment (HT) of porous carbons has proved popular to remove specic types of oxygen-functional groups9,10 and improve the degree of graphitization of porous carbons.3,11,12 HT above 1273 K is especially crucial to remove graphene-edge sites via zipping reactions and to achieve advanced carbon materials with high durability and electrical conductivity,13 whereas HT above 1273 K oen causes pore shrinkage due to graphitization.14\u201316\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Since CMS mesoporosity remains almost intact up to 2073 K,13 it is an interesting model system for analyzing graphene-zipping reactions and the resultant increase in graphene domain size at such high-temperatures (Fig. 1). It is also essential to elucidate the optimal conditions for facilitating graphene-zipping reactions without the development of graphene stacking to synthesize advanced functional carbon materials like graphene mesosponge (GMS), that are expected to show promise in a variety of applications due to its developedmesoporosity, high specic surface area, high electrical conductivity, high durability, and unique mechanical exibility.13\nHerein, the structural evolution of CMS is thoroughly analyzed by various methods, including transmission electron microscopy (TEM), N2 gas adsorption, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Raman spectroscopy, advanced temperatureprogrammed desorption (TPD) up to 2073 K (Fig. 1), neutron scattering, H2O-vapor adsorption, solid-state\n13C-NMR, so Xray emission spectroscopy (SXES), and magnetic susceptibility measurement using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). Moreover, structural properties relationships are examined, focusing on their thermal stability in the air, electrochemical stability, elasticity, and electric conductivity. This study delves into a profound comprehension of the intricate molecular-level structural transformations that transpire during the process of zippering reactions amid graphene sheets at a temperature range from 1273 K to 2273 K. The ndings furnish a roadmap towards attaining coveted attributes in ubiquitous porous carbon materials and other carbonaceous frameworks via HT, thereby propelling the advancement of superior porous carbon materials.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

The mixed powder was placed into a homemade quartz tube, and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) (20 vol%-methane in Ar, 1173 K for 2 h) was performed. We previously reported the optimal conditions for the deposition of almost single-layer graphene sheets onto Al2O3 based on the unique catalysis of oxygen-vacancy sites generated at the initial stage of CVD.25 Aer cooling to room temperature, the sample was sieved to separate the carbon-coated Al2O3-NP and the quartz sand. Finally, CMS was obtained by chemically etching the carboncoated Al2O3-NP with HF for 6 h at room temperature. Then, the CMS was annealed at designated temperatures between 1173 and 2873 K for 1 h. The HT was performed in a vacuum below 2073 K and in Ar above 2073 K. The heat-treated samples are denoted by the HT temperature (K). Note that 2273, 2573 and 2873 samples for TPD, SXES, electrochemical stability, elasticity, and electric conductivity measurements were prepared with an annealing time of 30 min."

            "text": "The nanostructures of the samples were observed with a transmission electron microscope (TEM: JEM-2010, JEOL Ltd.) with an accelerating voltage of 200 V. N2 adsorption measurements were carried out at 77 K using a volumetric sorption analyzer (BEL Japan, BELSORPMAX). The specic surface area (SBET) was calculated by the Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) method in the pressure range of P/P0 = 0.1\u20130.3. PXRD patterns of the samples were recorded by using an X-ray diffractometer (MiniFlex600, Rigaku Co.) with CuKa radiation generated at 40 kV and 15 mA. The average size of the planar graphene moiety (LPXRD) detected by carbon 10 peak is calculated using the Scherrer equation:\nLPXRD \u00bc Kl W10 cos q\n(1)\nwhere K is the Scherrer constant (taken as 1.84), l is the X-ray wavelength (0.15418 nm here), W10 is the FWHM of the diffraction peak of the carbon (10) plane, and q is the diffraction angle. The intensity was normalized using the peak at around 43\u00b0 assigned to the carbon (10) plane. Raman spectra were measured with a Jasco NRS-3300FL spectrometer with the 532.2 nm line, and the intensity was normalized using the Gband. To estimate the number of edge sites, a TPD measurement was performed up to 2073 K with a heating rate of 10 K min\u22121 using the advanced TPD system developed by our group (Fig. 1).26,27 The thermal decomposition of oxygenfunctional groups and hydrogen-terminated edge sites generates CO, CO2, H2O, and H2. The number of the terminated edgesites (Nedge [mmol g\n\u22121]) can be estimated from the amount of the desorbed gas as\nChem.

The interpretation of CO, CO2, and H2O is actually complicated. For example, when a phenol group is decomposed as CO, a H-terminated edge site is le, and it is desorbed as H2 by coupling with H desorbed from another Hterminated edge site. Thus, it causes an overestimation. On the other hand, if H2O is formed fromH-terminal edge sites and phenols, Nedge could be underestimated since two edge sites count as one. Since it is difficult to distinguish all the diverse reactions, we use the simplied eqn (2) in this work. Subsequently, the average size of the graphene layers (LTPD [nm]) can be estimated, where we assume that the shape of graphene sheets is coronene-type hexagonal as\nLTPD y 2NCa\nNedge (3)\nwhere a and NC correspond to the lattice parameter of the a-axis (0.2461 nm) and the number of carbon atoms (approximately 83.26 mmol g\u22121 when the size of the graphene sheet is much larger than a), respectively.26,28 To discuss the presence of carbon polygons and curvature in carbon frameworks, a highresolution-pair distribution function (PDF), g(r), was obtained using the neutron total scattering instrument, NOVA (BL21), at the Material and Life Science Facility of the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex. The structure factor, S(Q), was obtained by irradiating 100 mg of powder sealed in a V\u2013Ni null scattering sample container for 4.5 h at room temperature with a 500 kW spallation neutron source and correcting the obtained diffraction prole for the background, self-attenuation, number of incident neutrons, solid angle of detectors, multiple scattering, and incoherent scattering cross-sections. g(r) was derived by Fourier transformation of S(Q) in the Q range of 0.2\u2013 55.0 \u00c5. The adsorption isotherms of H2O vapor were measured at 298 K using a volumetric sorption analyzer (BEL Japan, BELSORPMAX). 13C cross polymerization-magic angle spinning (CP-MAS) NMR spectra were obtained on a JEOL JNM-ECA800 (800 MHz) spectrometer. SXES was performed on an original SXES attached to a scanning electron microscope of JSM6480LV.29,30 A varied-line-spacing grating, JS200N, with an average groove density of 1200 lines per mm, was used in these experiments. Because the acceptable energy range of this spectrometer is limited, the second-order spectrum of C Kemission, C\u2013K(2), was measured. The spin density in each carbon sample was calculated from its magnetic susceptibility.26,31 The measurement was performed with a SQUID magnetometer (MPMS-5SW, Quantum Design Inc.) under a eld strength of 1 T between 2 K and 300 K. The observed susceptibility c is expressed by using the Curie\u2013Weiss term cC and temperature-independent term c0 as\nc \u00bc cC \u00fe c0 \u00bc C\nT TC \u00fe c0 (4)\n8450 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 8448\u20138457\nwhere C, T, and TC are the Curie constant, temperature, and Weiss temperature, respectively. Eqn (4) can be transformed into\n1 c c0 \u00bc T C TC C (5)\nTo determine C, 1/(c \u2212 c0) was plotted against T. A suitable range of T was selected so that the 1/(c \u2212 c0) vs. T curve exhibits a linear relationship. The temperature-independent term c0 was determined to maximize the coefficient of determination (R2) of the tted line. Note that the plots were performed in a narrow temperature range below 20 K for the samples aer HT because temperature-dependent Landau diamagnetism was observed. Then, the spin density Nspin was calculated using C obtained from eqn (5), according to\nC \u00bc Nsping 2mB 2S\u00f0S \u00fe 1\u00de 3kB\n(6)\nwhere g, mB, S, and kB are the g-factor (assumed to be 2.002319), the Bohr magneton (= 9.274\u00d7 10\u221224 J T\u22121), the total spin quantum number, and Boltzmann constant (= 1.381 \u00d7 10\u221223 J K\u22121), respectively. S can take the value of 1/2 or 1 for unpaired electron spins. Here, Nspin is calculated assuming S is 1/2 for simplicity.26\nTheoretical simulations of zipping reactions\n2946 carbon atoms were randomly placed on the surface of a hypothetical spherical alumina of 4.66 nm in diameter using Monte Carlo simulation. Then, a quench molecular dynamics (QMD) simulation was performed to investigate the mechanism of carbon\u2013carbon interactions on the surface of the spherical alumina (self-made simulation code). The reaction state summation32 potential was applied for the interaction between carbon atoms and the Lennard Jones (LJ) potential for the interaction between carbon atoms and the alumina surface. The alumina surface structure was assumed to be a spherical shell with a uniform atomic density. To prevent the desorption of carbon atoms from the alumina surface during the QMD simulation, the energy parameter of the LJ interaction potential between solid atoms and carbon atoms was set to e/k= 70 000 K (k is the Boltzmann constant and the size parameter was s = 0.34 nm). The initial temperature was 10 000 K, and the system was quenched to 298 K during the QMD simulation using the velocity rescaling method (quench rate: 13 K ps\u22121). The equations of motion were integrated using the velocity Verlet method with a time step of 0.05 fs for 750 ps. Finally, the CMSmodel was obtained by deleting the alumina sphere and all carbon atoms with a coordination number of one from the spherical carbon.\nWe created a ri in the graphene wall of the CMSmodel, and the generated edges were terminated by hydrogen and oxygenfunctional groups. Specically, 4 ether, 11 hydroxyl, 20 methine, 10 carboxyl, and 4 carbonyl, were attached leading to a total of 2589 atoms present in the CMS model. The molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed using Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS)33\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

The simulation cell was 7.0 nm \u00d7 7.0 nm \u00d7 7.0 nm in size. Aer increasing the temperature from 298 K to 3000 K (17 K ps\u22121), the canonical ensemble MD simulation (NVT-MD) was performed for 125 ps while the temperature was controlled at 3000 K using the Nose\u2013Hoover method. In the nal step, gas molecules leaving the CMS model were removed from the simulation cell. Then, the NVT-MD simulation was run for 250 ps at 3000 K, and again gas molecules were removed from the simulation cell in the nal step. This was repeated twice. The temperature was then controlled at 3000 K for 125 ps and then lowered to 298 K (17 K ps\u22121) to generate the CMS model with partially fused ris.\nEvaluation of electrochemical and mechanical properties\nAir-oxidation durability was examined using a thermogravimetry analyzer (Shimadzu TGA-51). The samples were heated up to 1173 K for 180 min under air ow. Electrochemical oxidation resistance was also examined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) using a three-electrode cell at 298 K. The mesoporous carbon samples were mixed with a binder polymer (PTFE; PTFE 6-J, Du PontMitsui Fluorochemicals Co. Ltd.) and carbon black (Denka black, Denki Kagaku Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha) at a ratio of 90 : 5 : 5. The resulting mixture was molded into a square sheet (1 \u00d7 1 cm2, 5\u201310 mg), and sandwiched between a Pt mesh, to form a working electrode. The electrolyte was 1 M Et4NBF4/PC. An activated carbon ber (Unitika, A20) was used for the counter electrode, which was prepared in the same method as working electrodes except for its amount (ca. 20 mg). The reference electrode was Ag/AgClO4. The CV was performed as follows. First, the CV scans were performed in the potential range of \u22120.5 to 0.5 V with a scan rate of 1 mV s\u22121, and then the upperlimit potential was gradually increased by 0.1 V up to 2.1 V. In each potential range, the CV scan was repeated four times. The irreversible electric charge (Qir) was calculated as\nQir = Qpositive \u2212 Qnegative (7)\nwhere Qpositive and Qnegative are the total charges during a positive-direction scan above an open circuit potential and the one during a negative-direction scan, respectively.35 The bulk modulus of samples was measured from a mercury intrusion test using an Autopore IV 9510 (Micromeritics Instrument Corporation). The stress\u2013strain curve of a powdery sample can be obtained frommercury intrusion by choosing a relatively low Hg pressure region at which the nanopores are not yet impregnated by Hg.13,19 The bulk modulus is estimated from the slope of the curve according to the following equation.\nk \u00bc V0 DP DV\n(8)\nwhere k, V0, DP, DV are the bulk modulus, the initial volume, the changes of pressure, and the changes of volume, respectively. The electric conductivity of the carbon powders was measured by a two-probe method.13 The conductivity was measured while\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

            "text": "Each primary particle of the Al2O3-NP template was about 7 nm in diameter and partially connected (Fig. 2a). The size of secondary particles is around 30\u2013100 mm (the data are not shown here). Al2O3-NP has unique catalytic properties for the conversion of methane into graphene sheets, and the formation of the rst layer occurs about three times faster than the following layers.25,36,37 Thus, 1\u20132 layers of carbon sheets can be formed on the surface of the Al2O3-NP (Fig. 2b). The shape of the templated carbon (CMS) roughly imitates themorphology of the Al2O3-NP (Fig. 2c), with primary cells composed of curved graphene walls bonded to each other. The size of the primary cells of CMS does not change even aer HT at 2073 K (Fig. 2d), but becomes larger at higher temperatures (Fig. 2e and f). Although the change of graphene stacking number is difficult to see in Fig. 2e because of the limitation of the TEM resolution, the number of carbon layers increases aer HT above 2073 K, as shown later. CMS comprises of curved graphene walls, and the structure is retained up to 2073 K. These results indicate that HT below 2073 K does not signicantly change the cellular graphene structure, while the signicant rearrangement of carbon atoms occurs above 2073 K to form stacked graphene walls with larger cellular structures because of the progress of the graphitization.38\nN2 adsorption\u2013desorption isotherms are shown in Fig. S1,\u2020 and the BET specic surface areas (SBET) are plotted against the HT temperature in Fig. 3a. It should be noted that we plot the as-synthesized CMS data provisionally at room temperature (298 K) as a reference. Although the synthesis process of CMS includes CVD at 1173 K, the CVD-derived carbon is in a metastable state because of the protective effect of the inorganic template. Aer template removal, a structural change occurs, including the introduction of a signicant number of oxygenfunctional groups.39 Thus, the thermal stability of templated carbons is generally lower than expected from their CVD\nChem.

            "text": "PXRD was used to evaluate the crystallinity of graphene sheets (Fig. S2a\u2020).40,41 The peak at around 25\u00b0 is assigned to the carbon (002) plane, corresponding to the stacking structure of graphene layers. The peak at around 43\u00b0 is assigned to the carbon (10) plane, corresponding to the in-plane diffraction of graphene, typically found in turbostratic carbons.42 Interestingly, no signicant change is observed in the PXRD pattern up to 2273 K, while there is a noticeable increase in the 002 peak intensity above 2573 K, indicating the development of stacked graphene-sheets. Next, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 002 (W002) and 10 (W10) peaks are used as a measure for the degree of graphene stacking and the domain size of the graphene basal plane, respectively (Fig. 3b). Specically, the larger the W002, the lower the degree of graphene stacking, and the\n8452 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 8448\u20138457\nlarger the W10, the smaller the size of the basal plane. The generally observed trend is that W002 and W10 decrease as a function of HT temperature, indicating an increase in graphene stacking and domain size. W002 shows a rapid decrease above 2273 K, as seen from the intensive development of the carbon 002 peak in Fig. S2a.\u202043 The gradual reduction in W10 indicates a successive growth of the basal plane over the whole temperature range. Notably, from Fig. S2a,\u2020 we see that the carbon 002 and 10 peaks become asymmetric above 2573 K. This could be due to the broad and sharp peaks overlapping, suggesting that part of the carbon framework inhomogeneously turns into a highly crystalline structure. These PXRD results agree with the above structural discussion based on the TEM images and N2 adsorption isotherms.\nNext, Raman spectroscopy was performed to analyze the degree of disorder and defects in the graphene framework (Fig. S2b\u2020). Here, three peaks were observed in the samples, i.e., the D-, G-, and G\u2032- (also known as 2D) bands.44\u201346 The D-band stands for a breathing mode of a carbon hexagon, which becomes active at carbon defects.47 G-band and G\u2032-band are the characteristic peaks of the graphene structure. The position of the G\u2032-band is sensitive to the number of layers and the stacking arrangement of the graphene layers. In Fig. S2b,\u2020 the intensity of the D-band decreases with increasing the HT temperature, indicating fewer defects aer high-temperature HT. The intensity ratio of the D-band and G-band (ID/IG) is plotted in Fig. 3c. A higher ID/IG ratio generally indicates a higher concentration of defects or structural disorders in the material.48 Notably, the ID/ IG decreases between 1373 and 2073 K, at which nano-level morphology is still not remarkably changed, as found from TEM (Fig. 2) and N2 adsorption (Fig. 3a). This suggests the reduction of the microscopic defects that are not detected by TEM and N2 adsorption in this temperature range. The ID/IG further decreases above 2073 K because of the development of planar and stacked graphene structures, as suggested by TEM (Fig. 2) and PXRD (Fig. 3b and S2a\u2020). PXRD shows relatively broad carbon 002 and 10 peaks even at 2873 K, indicating that CMS can be categorized as a hardly graphitizable carbon (hard carbon). In conventional hard carbons, most edge sites are removed at 2073 K,26 but graphitization is prohibited by a rigid carbon framework consisting of stacked and curved structures even above 2773 K. Thus, hard carbons heat-treated above 2773 K still show intense D-band, because of the signicant curvature.49,50 However, the ID/IG ratio of CMS becomes almost zero at 2873 K. This means that the unique framework structure of CMS, i.e., rarely stacked graphene sheets, enhances the rearrangement of carbon atoms, and both carbon edge sites and topological defects are signicantly decreased at 2873 K. Also, the upshi of the G\u2032-band above 2073 K indicates carbon-atom rearrangement to form a stacked graphene structure.44 The IG\u2032/ IG ratio gradually increases with increasing HT temperature but should be discussed separately before and aer the development of graphene stacking. Before the occurrence of signicant graphene stacking below 2073 K, the increase in IG\u2032/IG is attributed to zipping reactions between small graphene sheets to form better quality single-graphene structures (a detailed discussion on edge fusion is given later).

This is possibly because of the formation of specic stacking angles giving an intense G\u2032 peak.52,53 The formation of turbostratic structures is also supported by the PXRD results (Fig. S2a\u2020)."

            "text": "An advanced TPD analysis was carried out to quantify the number of edge sites in the samples. Our TPD system can reach a temperature of 2073 K, which is necessary to determine the total gas evolution of H2, H2O, CO, and CO2 from oxygen functional groups and hydrogen-terminated edge sites in carbonmaterials.26 Fig. S3\u2020 shows each amount of desorbed gas from CMS and its heat-treated samples (see also Fig. S4\u2020 for the gas-evolution proles). CMS is synthesized by a hard template method, and many oxygen-functional groups are introduced upon template removal.39 Therefore, CMS emits a large amount of gases. H2 gas emission occurs in two steps, before and aer 1073 K (Fig. S4a\u2020). The former is ascribed to the H2 emission along with the decomposition of H-including oxygen-functional groups such as \u2013COOH from the intense H2O, CO, and CO2 emissions below 1073 K (Fig. S4b\u2013d\u2020). The latter is ascribed to graphene-zipping reactions.24 As shown in Fig. 3d, the total amount of desorbed gas signicantly decreases at temperatures below 1873 K, indicating the progress of the graphene zipping reactions,24 and then remains relatively low level up to 2873 K. Here, the average graphene-domain size (LTPD) can be estimated using the total number of edge sites analyzed by the TPD method (see Experimental section for calculation details).26 While LPXRD represents the size of the planar graphene moiety in a curved graphene sheet, LTPD can represent the entire graphene size regardless of the curvature (Fig. 4a). Table S1\u2020 summarizes LPXRD and LTPD of CMS and its heat-treated\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nsamples. LTPD shows a signicant change even below 2073 K, unlike LPXRD. LTPD increases 39 times aer annealing at 2073 K (from 6.9 nm to 270 nm). This means that approximately 1100 graphene fragments (size: 6.9 nm) coalesce to form a larger structure via zipping reactions. Thus, the material synthesized at 2073 K (called GMS) comprises of a continuous edge-free curved graphene sheet with nano-cellular structures (Fig. 2d). The evolution of the graphene size is estimated by TPD and depicted in Fig. 4b. LTPD stays almost constant from 2073 K to 2873 K, indicating that the zipping reactions are terminated at 2073 K and drastic rearrangement forming graphene stacking structures begins above this temperature. Interestingly, the total gas evolution amount slightly increases from 2073 K to 2273 K. This could be ascribed to the generation of some dangling bonds along with the carbon atom rearrangement forming stacking structures at 2273 K, as suggested by the decrease of SBET (see Fig. 3a). The dangling bonds formed during HT react with O2 and H2O when the sample is exposed to air aer HT, and TPD detects some gas evolution.\nThe zipping reactions between the graphene sheets are further discussed below. TPD results (Fig. 3d) indicate that the zipping reactions are almost complete at 1873 K. The Raman Dband is derived not only from edge sites but also from carbon 5- and 7-membered rings known as topological defects.24 Thus, even aer zipping reactions, the Raman spectrum still shows a relatively large ID/IG at 1873 K (Fig. 3c). Indeed, we have recently reported the origin of an intense D-band of GMS is derived from topological defects by atomic-resolution TEM and theoretical calculations.24 Fig. 4c shows an illustration of the progress of a zipping reaction. A decrease of the ID/IG from 1873 K to 2073 K suggests the partial rearrangement of topological defects into carbon hexagons because the total TPD gas evolution does not signicantly decrease. From 2073 K to 2873 K, ID/ IG successively decreases, indicating a further transformation of topological defects into carbon hexagons. Such structural change accords with the results of TEM (Fig. 2d\u2013f) and PXRD (Fig. 3b and S2a\u2020).\nThe zipping reactions of the edge sites were further investigated using molecular dynamics simulations. As shown in Fig. 4d, the carbon edge sites gradually fuse through the zipping reactions. As a result, topological defects of 5- and 7-membered rings are introduced throughout the boundary. These results support our experimental conclusions indicating topological defects are indeed formed by graphene zipping reactions.24\nWhen there is a signicant amount of carbon 5- and 7- membered rings, they can be detected by high-resolution-pair distribution function (PDF) obtained from neutron diffraction.54 The second nearest neighbor carbon distance are 2.33, 2.46, and 2.48\u20132.50 \u00c5 in carbon pentagons, hexagons, and heptagons, respectively (Fig. 5a).54 It was theoretically predicted that structures containing 19% pentagons and 23% heptagons show the corresponding resolve peaks, respectively.54 CMS and its heat-treated samples have nano-cellular structures, and should include carbon non-hexagon rings at their curvatures (Fig. 5b). The PDF patterns of these samples are shown in Fig. 5c, together with reference data from graphite and C60. Interestingly, the PDF patterns are almost identical in CMS and\nChem.

This means that CMS comprises a well-developed sp2-carbon network mainly consisting of carbon hexagons, and the number of non-hexagonal rings introduced by zipping reactions is insignicant. Indeed, the ratio of carbon polygons at the boundary of the graphene fragments in CMS (ca. 6.9 nm) is estimated to be as low as 7%. Note that not all the boundary sites become topological defects. Undetectable carbon 5- and 7-membered rings in Fig. 5c suggest that some of the boundaries form new carbon hexagons aer coalescence.\nThe presence of the edge sites is further analyzed by H2Ovapor adsorption measurements, as shown in Fig. S5.\u2020 The amount of H2O adsorption at low pressure generally decreases with increasing the HT temperature. Since carbon materials are hydrophobic, H2O can be adsorbed by carbon edge-sites at low pressure,18 and thus, this change corresponds to the decrease of the carbon edge sites upon annealing.\nChange of other physicochemical properties by HT\nThe solid-state 13C NMR spectra of CMS before and aer HT at 2073 K are shown in Fig. S6.\u2020 Both samples show a peak of around 115 ppm, typical in sp2-carbon materials, and are free from the peak of sp3-carbons around 40\u201360 ppm.55,56 These results suggest that the sp2-carbon network of the CMS framework is well developed and cannot be distinguished from the sample annealed at 2073 K by 13C NMR.\nSXES provides information on the valence electron structures of carbon materials.57 As shown in Fig. S7,\u2020 HT of CMS up to 2873 K hardly changes the spectrum shape. The SXES results accord well with the results of PDF (Fig. 5) and 13C NMR: CMS already comprises a well-developed sp2-carbon network of carbon hexagons. However, as shown below, its magnetic properties, chemical and electrochemical stability, mechanical properties, and electric conductivity greatly differ from its heattreated samples. This means that PDF, 13C NMR, and SXES cannot predict these properties of porous carbon materials.\n8454 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 8448\u20138457\nA magnetic susceptibility measurement was performed to determine the spin density. According to the Curie\u2013Weiss law, the magnetic susceptibility from unpaired electron spins is inversely proportional to measurement temperature.26,31 As shown in Fig. 6a, CMS shows clear Curie paramagnetism in the region below 50 K, which is reduced in the samples aer HT. In carbon materials, unpaired electrons are generally believed to exist at carbon edge sites.58 Therefore, the fusion of the edge sites by annealing should induce a decrease in the number of unpaired electron spins. Indeed, the annealing temperature dependence of the unpaired electron density (Nspin) and Nedge measured by TPD show similar trends (Fig. 6b). In the hightemperature range of 50\u2013300 K, the absolute value of magnetic susceptibility (c) is generally enhanced with increasing annealing temperature. The sample annealed at 2873 K shows the largest c, and the absolute value decreases with increasing the measurement temperature. This characteristic temperature dependence is ascribed to Landau diamagnetism originating from cyclotronmotion of conduction p-electrons in the carbon basal plane.59\u201361 Thus, HT at high temperatures enhances the diamagnetism because of the increase in the graphene-domain size and graphene stacking."

Our results show that the welldeveloped sp2-carbon network and the mesopore structure remain intact until 2073 K. At higher temperatures, pores collapse and graphene layer stacking occurs, accompanied by morphological changes and increased crystallization. Carbon edge sites, where oxidation initiates, are mostly removed at 1873 K, and a larger continuous graphene framework is formed as the result of graphene-zipping reactions that take place between neighboring graphene domains. Oxidation resistance, elasticity, and electrical conductivity are strongly related to the number of edge sites, topological defects, the size of the continuous graphene sheet, and the number of layers in the graphene structures. Therefore, HT at 1873\u20132073 K can achieve excellent electrical conductivity, high durability, and unique mechanical exibility due to the minimal number of edge sites, large continuous graphene sheet, and still intactmesoporous structure without graphene layer stacking. Beneting from these unique properties, it exhibits excellent potential on supercapacitors, lithium batteries, polymer-electrolyte fuel cells, catalyst supports, high-capacity adsorbents, and new types of heat pumps.
