            "text": "Polypropylene non-woven fabrics (PP NWFs) have been prevalent in industries such as medicine, sanitation and packaging, owing to their high mechanical strength and biocompatibility. However, in medical or sanitary applications, the presence of bacteria on the surface of PP NWFs can lead to serious problems, such as bacterial colonization and biofilm formation.1 Hence, various approaches for bacterial inhibition have been investigated.2\u20135 The antibacterial modification of device surfaces is a prevalent technique for preventing bacterial infections.6 Various antibacterial agents, including antibiotics and antibacterial drugs, have been utilised as coatings on medical devices.6\nAlthough many antibiotics and antibacterial drugs have been developed,7,8 the emerging antimicrobial resistance (AMR) of bacteria has made the control and treatment of bacterial infections difficult.9,10 For example, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) shows resistance against most b-lactam antibiotics, and the spread of MRSA in hospitals is an urgent problem.11,12 Hence, an antibacterial strategy that is independent of antibiotics is a desirable solution.\nRecently, antimicrobial peptides,13,14 cationic compounds,15\u201317 metal nanoparticles,18,19 and polymer nanoparticles20\u201322 have\nreceived considerable attention because of their broad-spectrum activities. They absorb on the membranes of bacterial cell and induce leakage of the cell contents. Membrane disruption is also effective against drug-resistant bacteria. For example, a surface modified with Ag nanoparticles has shown antibacterial activity against MRSA.23\nBy contrast, the direct modification of PP materials with antibacterial agents is difficult because they are hydrophobic and exhibit poor interactions with other molecules. Current methods for the antibacterial modification of PP NWFs are costly and require multiple steps, rendering them impractical for industrial use.24\u201328 Hence, there is a need for an efficient and cost-effective method for the antibacterial modification of PP NWFs.\nIn recent years, our group has developed a surface-modification method for polymer materials that uses photo-activated chlorine dioxide radicals (ClO2 ).\n29\u201332 The photo-activated ClO2 act as a strong oxidizing agent that is capable of cleaving C\u2013H bonds, thus introducing oxygen-containing functional groups onto the polymer surface. This technique improves the hydrophilicity of PP films for better reactivity. In addition, owing to the gaseous oxidants used, our method is applicable to the oxidative modification of threedimensional network structures such as PP NWFs.32\nIn this study, we found that oxidised PP NWFs exhibited excellent antibacterial properties against Escherichia coli (Gramnegative) and Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive). The modified PP NWFs were characterised using Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and toluidine blue O (TBO) assays. The antibacterial mechanism of the modified PP NWFs was also investigated by a Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Osaka University, Yamada-oka 1-6, Suita, Osaka, 565-0871, Japan.

The washed samples were then rinsed with distilled water three times, followed by drying in vacuo. The samples washed in ethanol and acetone, e.g., for Ox-80, are denoted as Ox-80-EtOH and Ox-80-Ac, respectively (Scheme 1b)."

The bacterial suspensions used to inoculate the samples were prepared as follows. One colony of bacteria was added to 20 mL of nutrient broth (NB) and incubated at 37 1C for 24 h (110 rpm). Next, 400 mL of the previous suspension was added to 20 mL of NB and incubated for 3 h at 37 1C (110 rpm). The bacterial concentration was measured and diluted with 1/20 NB (in distilled water) to approximately (1\u20133) 105 colony-forming units mL 1 (CFU mL 1). Then, each sample (six pieces each of the test sample and control sample) was inoculated with 200 mL of the prepared bacterial suspension.

The surface elemental compositions and bonding states of the PP NWF samples were determined via XPS using an ESCA 3057 instrument (Ulvac-PHI, Japan) with a dual-anode Mg Ka source (1253.6 eV) operating at 400 W. A pass energy (PE) of 117.40 eV was used to acquire wide-range survey spectra, while a PE of 29.35 eV was used to acquire narrow C 1s spectra. The XPS data were analysed using MultiPak software (version 9). All spectra were calibrated with the hydrocarbon C 1s photoemission set at the 285.0 eV binding energy. The surface morphologies of the PP NWF samples were observed via FE-SEM using a JSM-F100 microscope (JEOL, Japan) set at 3.0 kV.\nQuantification of surface carboxy groups on the PP NWFs\nThe surface carboxy (\u2013COOH) groups of the PP NWF samples were quantified using the toluidine blue O (TBO) assay, based on the 1 : 1 formation of TBO with \u2013COOH via electrostatic interactions.34 First, PP NWF samples (2 cm 2 cm) were incubated in 4 mL of the TBO solution (0.1% TBO in 1 mM NaOH) at 40 1C for 15 min (120 rpm). The samples were washed with 4 mL of 1 mM NaOH at 40 1C for 5 min with stirring (120 rpm). The washing process was repeated at least five times until the supernatant was clear. Finally, TBO was desorbed via incubation in 4 mL 20% SDS solution at 40 1C for 30 min (120 rpm). The TBO concentration in the SDS supernatant was calculated from the absorption at 630 nm using an ultravioletvisible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometer V-750 (Jasco, Japan). The results were calculated as the average of three replicates.\nAcetone washing of oxidised PP NWFs\nFirst, 10 pieces of the PP NWFs samples (4 cm 4 cm), including the non-treated, Ox-30, Ox-60, and Ox-80 samples, were prepared. The prepared samples were then placed in acetone (20 mL) and shaken for 1 min.\nOptical microscopy observation of acetone washing solution\nOptical microscopy of the acetone washing solution of the PP NWF samples was performed using a Spotlight 200i FT-IR microscope with a Spectrum Two spectrometer (PerkinElmer, USA).\nCharacterization of nanoparticles in the acetone washing solution of the PP NWFs\nOptical microscopy measurements were performed using a BX53M optical microscope (OLYMPUS, Tokyo, Japan). The diameter of the nanoparticles was evaluated via dynamic light scattering (DLS) using an ELSZ-2 particle size analyser (Otsuka Electronics Co., Ltd, Japan). The samples for DLS measurements were prepared as follows. The PP NWF samples oxidised at 80 1C were placed in acetone and washed with distilled water. The acetone solution was shaken for 1 min, and the PP NWF samples were removed. The acetone solution was centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 1 min for separation of the fibrous dispersion from the solution, and the supernatant including the nanoparticles was used for the DLS measurements. The zeta potential values of the nanoparticles in H2O were measured using the ELSZ-2 instrument (Otsuka Electronics Co., Ltd, Japan). For the zeta potential measurements, the nanoparticle solution was prepared as follows. The Ox-80 samples were placed in acetone and then washed with distilled water. The acetone solution was shaken for 1 min and the PP NWFs were removed. The acetone solution was centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 1 min for separation of the fibrous dispersion from the solution, and the supernatant including the nanoparticles was heated at 70 1C until the acetone had evaporated. The residue was dispersed in 60 mL of acetone followed by adding 3 mL of distilled water. Aqueous solutions were used for the zeta potential measurements. The results were calculated as the average of 10 replicates."

First, the functional groups were characterised using FT-IR spectroscopy (Fig. 1, and Fig. S1, ESI\u2020). In the oxidised samples, new peaks were observed at 1720 cm 1, corresponding to the stretching of the carbonyl (CQO) groups.32 Next, the oxidised PP NWF samples were washed with 70% ethanol and acetone. After washing, the characteristic carbonyl peaks at 1720 cm 1 were diminished, especially in Ox-80, indicating that the newly incorporated carbonyl groups were unstable in polar organic solvents.\nThe FE-SEM images obtained (Fig. 2) revealed mound structures on the surface of Ox-80, as previously reported.32 After washing with ethanol and acetone, the mounds on Ox-80 disappeared, indicating that the surface deposits were washed away by polar organic solvents. Considering the diminished\n1720 cm 1 peaks, the surface deposits are presumed to be rich in carbonyl groups.\nTo further characterize the surface of the PP NWF samples, the surface elemental and chemical compositions were determined via XPS (Fig. S2 in the ESI\u2020: the wide-scan XPS spectra). Only carbon was detected in the control samples, whereas Ox30 and Ox-80 contained 15.1% and 12.0% oxygen, respectively (Table 4). By contrast, Ox-80-EtOH contained 5.0% oxygen, indicating a decreased oxygen ratio after washing with ethanol. To further our understanding, the C 1s XPS spectra of the PP NWF samples were analysed. The C 1s XPS spectra exhibit five distinct peaks at 285.0, 286.3, 287.0, 288.3, and 289.1 eV, which are attributed to C\u2013C, C\u2013O, C\u2013Cl, C\u2013Cl2/CQO, and \u2013COO groups, respectively (Fig. S3 in ESI\u2020). Table 5 lists the ratios of the functional groups. In Ox-30 and Ox-80, the ratio of \u2013COO groups was 2.8% and 4.2%, respectively, suggesting that more carboxy groups were introduced to the PP NWFs during\nTable 2 Results of antibacterial testing in Ox-30 and Ox-80\nBacteria E. coli S. aureus Sample Non-treated Ox-30 Ox-80 Non-treated Ox-30 Ox-80 Log CFU t = 0 4.58 4.70 4.65 4.72 4.78 4.72 t = 20 7.80 7.65 2.30 8.02 6.63 2.90 A \u2014 0.27 5.57 \u2014 1.45 5.12 Percentage reduction (%) \u2014 46.3 99.9997 \u2014 96.5 99.9992\nTable 3 Results of antibacterial testing in Ox-80-EtOH and Ox-80-Ac\nBacteria E. coli E. coli Sample Non-treated Ox-80-EtOH Non-treated Ox-80-Ac Log CFU t = 0 3.74 3.83 4.45 4.41 t = 20 7.30 6.61 8.02 8.06 A \u2014 0.78 \u2014 0.08 Percentage reduction (%) \u2014 83.4 \u2014 20.2\nFig. 1 FT-IR spectra of PP NWFs over wavenumber ranges of (a) 4000\u2013 1000 cm 1 and (b) 2000\u20131500 cm 1: non-treated (black), Ox-30 (blue), Ox-80 (red), Ox-80-EtOH (purple), and Ox-80-Ac (pink).\nTable 4 Surface elemental compositions (%) of the PP NWF samples, as measured via XPS\nC N O Cl Non-treated 100.0 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Ox-30 69.7 \u2014 15.1 15.1 Ox-80 77.3 \u2014 12.0 10.7 Ox-80-EtOH 90.5 \u2014 5.0 4.5\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

In Ox-80-EtOH, the ratio of \u2013COO groups was only 0.1%, which is consistent with the decreased intensity of the carbonyl peak at 1720 cm 1 after ethanol washing.\nThe C 1s XPS spectra showed a decrease in carboxy groups upon washing with polar organic solvents. Here, we quantified the surface carboxy groups per unit mass of PP NWFs using the toluidine blue O (TBO) assay. Table 6 present the results of the TBO assay (the data are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI\u2020)). The non-treated samples exhibited limited TBO adsorption, whereas the oxidised samples exhibited good TBO absorption. The calculated surface carboxy groups on the non-treated, Ox-30, and Ox-80 samples were 0.5 0.2, 2.7 0.1, and 10.0 1.0 mmol g 1, respectively. By contrast, the calculated surface carboxy groups on Ox-80-EtOH and Ox-80-Ac were 0.8 0.1 and 12.0 0.1 mmol g 1, respectively. These results suggest a decrease in the surface carboxy groups after ethanol washing.\nAntibacterial mechanism of oxidised PP NWFs\nIn recent years, antibacterial nanoparticles with various surface potential values have been reported.20,21,35 In particular, Sarian et al. reported negatively charged cyanoacrylate nanoparticles (20\u2013250 nm) that show a growth inhibitory effect against Grampositive and Gram-negative bacteria.20 The authors considered that the antibacterial activity was derived from disruption of the bacterial membrane and the subsequent generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) via physical interactions.20 The cyanoacrylate nanoparticles also induced disorder of the cell walls and inhibited growth in green microalgae, such as Chlamydomonas reinhardtii,36,37 and several non-green algae.38 Here, we considered the formation of nanoparticles during oxidation with photoactivated ClO2 as a factor that governs the antibacterial activity. The experimental results showed that Ox-80 exhibited excellent antibacterial activity, whereas Ox-80-EtOH and Ox-80-Ac did not, indicating that washing with polar organic solvents affected the antibacterial activity. The physical and chemical characteristics of the samples washed with polar organic solvents were examined to identify their antibacterial mechanism. Acetone was selected as the washing solvent because it has a lower boiling point than ethanol. The soluble and insoluble components of the acetone\nwashing solution of Ox-80 were analysed. The results from the examination of the acetone-soluble components are shown in the ESI.\u2020\nTen pieces of the Ox-80 sample (571.2 mg) were prepared and washed with acetone (20 mL). After washing and drying, the weight decreased to 563.5 mg, which is a 1.35% loss (7.7 mg). Ten pieces of the non-treated and Ox-30 samples were also washed with acetone. By contrast, the weight loss from acetone washing in the non-treated and Ox-30 samples was only 0.04% and 0.34%, respectively. The difference in weight change is consistent with the disappearance of the surface mounds after washing with a polar solvent, as shown in Fig. 2. Therefore, we predict that this weight change is due to cleavage of the PP main chains during oxidation to form smaller products that are acetone-soluble.\nThe acetone-insoluble components of the washing solution were also examined. Fibrous dispersions were observed in the acetone solutions of both the non-treated and Ox-80 samples (Fig. S5 (ESI\u2020)). An optical microscope (Spotlight 200i) was used to for further examination, and revealed that PP fibers and middle-sized particles (B50 mm) are present in both samples (Fig. S6 and S7, ESI\u2020). By contrast, small particles (o1 mm) were observed only in the Ox-80 sample (Fig. S6, ESI\u2020). Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements were carried out, and it was determined that 94.4% of the small Ox-80 particles were distributed in the range of 65\u2013140 nm (Fig. 3). The average diameter of the nanoparticles in this area was 82.6 16.1 nm.\nThe zeta potential of nanoparticles in H2O was 25.0 2.7 mV. Here, we predict that the B80 nm nanoparticles found on the PP fibers are related to its antibacterial activity, and that the oxidation reaction temperature affects the number of\nTable 6 Amount of adsorbed TBO for quantification of the surface \u2013COOH groups in the PP NWF samples (n = 3)\nSample TBO (mmol g 1) Non-treated 0.5 0.2 Ox-30 2.7 0.1 Ox-80 10.0 1.0 Ox-80-EtOH 0.8 0.1 Ox-80-Ac 1.2 0.1\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

To examine the relative number of nanoparticles, an optical microscope (BX53M) was used to observe the acetone washing solution of the PP NWF samples (non-treated, Ox-30, Ox-60, and Ox-80 samples). The PP NWF samples were prepared (4 cm 4 cm; 55 1 mg) and washed with 5 mL of acetone. Fig. 4 and Fig. S8 (ESI\u2020) show the optical microscopy images of the acetone washing solutions. In the non-treated and Ox-30 samples, nanoparticles were hardly observed, whereas nanoparticles were observed at high density in the Ox-60 and Ox-80 samples, indicating that more nanoparticles were formed through oxidation at 60 1C and 80 1C compared with at 30 1C.\nBased on these results, we suggest that the excellent antibacterial activity of the Ox-60 and Ox-80 PP NWFs can be attributed to the B80 nm nanoparticles formed during oxidation. There was a correlation between the antibacterial activity of the PP NWFs and the number of nanoparticles formed, and the acetone extracts of Ox-80 that included the nanoparticles showed the growth inhibition of E. coli (ESI); however, other factors could not be ruled out in this experiment. Whether the nanoparticles themselves impart antibacterial properties to the PP NWFs remains to be examined. Further investigations focusing on the antibacterial mechanism of nanoparticles are ongoing in our laboratory.\nIn medical situations, PP NWFs are used for disposable equipment, such as masks or gowns, because of their low cost. Hence, the antibacterial modification method for PP NWFs is expected to be inexpensive for practical and industrial use. By contrast, our modification method has an advantage regarding the cost. The ClO2 utilized for our modification can be prepared simply using inexpensive reagents (NaClO2 and HCl). In addition, our method requires only a single step and the modification effects are stable in air and H2O (Fig. S9, ESI\u2020). Considering the above, our findings are of scientific and practical interest."

            "text": "We demonstrated that PP NWFs oxidised at 80 1C using photoactivated ClO2 exhibit excellent antibacterial activity against E. coli (Gram-negative) and S. aureus (Gram-positive). To investigate the underlying mechanism of antibacterial activity, we analysed the polar organic solvents used to wash the oxidised PP NWFs. We found nanoparticles of B80 nm in diameter in the solvent, particularly when the oxidation step was carried out at high temperature (60 1C and 80 1C). Our findings suggest that the nanoparticles are formed during oxidation, and are involved in the antibacterial properties of the oxidised PP NWFs. The detailed structure of the nanoparticles, their mechanism of antimicrobial activity, and the long-term stability of the oxidized non-woven fabrics are still under investigation and will be reported in the near future."
