Only patients in risk of rapid medical deterioration were excluded and forwarded to intensive care. Objectives: Discussion of this unprecedented experience. Methods: Analysis of 28 patients hospitalized during 3 months with both an acute psychiatric disorder and an SARS-CoV-2 infection; description of the multidisciplinary intervention made.\nResults:Our sample was characterized by amajority of patients with an acute psychotic episode derived from a schizophrenia spectrum disorder (42%) or a bipolar affective disorder (21%). Only 3% of the patients had a diagnosis of severe major depressive disorder. And 10% of patients developed severe respiratory symptoms requiring oxygen or urgent transfer to COVID medical wards. Most patients presented periods of psychomotor agitation, lack of impulse control and self-aggression. Psychopharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions had to be adapted to these unusual conditions. Most of them had already gone through a period of isolation in the buffer ward created to exclude false negatives, which promoted atypical deliriums and symptoms of post-traumatic stress. The psychiatric team was faced with the emergent need to adapt an intervention model based on trust to amodel that had to prioritize physical safety. Conclusions:Thepandemic experiencewas transformative for allwho lived through it. From the challenge perspective, it may have been enriching. But the maintained confrontation with the antithesis of therapy,definedby \u201ccaring, supporting, communicating, approaching\u201d, was devastating in ways that we consider essential to be debated.\nDisclosure: No significant relationships.

Ven\u00e2ncio\nVila Nova de Gaia Hospital Center, Psychiatry And Mental Health Service, Vila Nova de Gaia, Portugal *Corresponding author. doi: 10.1192/j.eurpsy.2022.1327\nIntroduction: Since the first outbreak, the Covid-19 pandemic has had and still has several implications worldwide, particularly in severe mentally ill patients, leading to multiple challenges in their management. Objectives: We aim to assess the impact and implications of the Covid-19 pandemic on patients with Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders (SSD) and the treatment recommendations available. Methods: We conduct an integrative review using PubMed database. Search terms included: \u201cpsychosis\u201d AND \u201cCOVID-19 pandemic\u201d, \u201cschizophrenia and COVID-19\u201d, \u201csevere mental illness\u201d AND \u201cCOVID-19\u201d. The search period was between 1st January 2020 and 31th July 2021. Results: Studies postulated that people with SSD are at a higher risk of COVID-19 infection with a poorer medical and social outcome which is attributed to factors such as higher rates of disadvantageous lifestyle behaviours, medical comorbidities, antipsychotic medication metabolic effects, psychosocial adversities, smaller social networks and poor engagement with general health services. The Covid-19 pandemic also demanded adjustments in treatment guidelines and monitoring, particularly in patients with SSD on Clozapine. Many studies address the importance of psychiatric care and treatment during the pandemic. They emphasize rapid implementation of measures to decrease the risk of COVID-19 transmission and maintain continuity care and research. An individualized and flexible approach is needed to promote safety of SSD patients.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2022.1326 Published online by Cambridge University Press"
