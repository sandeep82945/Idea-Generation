1. **Investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between CBEO and MAPKs, NF-κB, and PKB/AKT proteins.** This could be done using techniques such as co-immunoprecipitation and Western blotting to confirm the physical interaction between CBEO and these proteins, as well as kinase assays to measure the effect of CBEO on their enzymatic activity.


2. **Evaluate the effect of CBEO on the expression of MAPKs, NF-κB, and PKB/AKT target genes.** This could be done using quantitative real-time PCR or Western blotting to measure the mRNA or protein levels of genes known to be regulated by these signaling pathways.


3. **Determine the role of MAPKs, NF-κB, and PKB/AKT in the antitumor activity of CBEO in vivo.** This could be done using animal models of melanoma, such as the B16F10 mouse model, to assess the effect of CBEO on tumor growth and metastasis.


4. **Investigate the potential of CBEO to overcome resistance to conventional chemotherapy drugs.** This could be done by treating melanoma cells with CBEO in combination with drugs such as doxorubicin or cisplatin, and assessing the effect of this combination on cell viability and tumor growth.


5. **Explore the potential of CBEO as a chemopreventive agent against melanoma.** This could be done by administering CBEO to mice prior to exposure to a melanoma-inducing agent, such as ultraviolet radiation, and assessing the effect of CBEO on the development of melanoma.
