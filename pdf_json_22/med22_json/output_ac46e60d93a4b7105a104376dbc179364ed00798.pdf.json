This study was designed to establish a novel macrophage-associated prognostic model for HCC. Methods: Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) microarrays and clinical data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were analysed using a univariate Cox proportional regression model to select macrophage-associated prognostic lncRNAs. Multivariate Cox proportional regression models and survival analysis were used to establish a prognosis index (PI) model. Furthermore, to better understand the biological functions of differentially expressed macrophage-associated lncRNAs (MALs) in HCC, enrichment analysis was performed. Finally, the correlation between MALs and clinical features was further analysed in HCC. Results: We identified eight MALs with significant prognostic values for HCC. Next, a PI model for HCC was developed, and patients were classified into the high-risk or low-risk group based on risk scores. The overall survival (OS) of high-risk patients was significantly shorter than that of low-risk patients (P < 0.001). Univariate and multivariate factors indicate that risk scores can be used as independent prognostic factors for patients with HCC. Multiple receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plots show that the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the risk score is higher than that of other clinical features. The C-index of our nomogram was 0.768. Conclusion: The PI model has a prognostic efficacy superior to that of other clinical features.",

Methods: Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) microarrays and clinical data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were analysed using a univariate Cox proportional regression model to select macrophage-associated prognostic lncRNAs. Multivariate Cox proportional regression models and survival analysis were used to establish a prognosis index (PI) model. Furthermore, to better understand the biological functions of differentially expressed macrophage-associated lncRNAs (MALs) in HCC, enrichment analysis was performed. Finally, the correlation between MALs and clinical features was further analysed in HCC. Results: We identified eight MALs with significant prognostic values for HCC. Next, a PI model for HCC was developed, and patients were classified into the high-risk or low-risk group based on risk scores. The overall survival (OS) of high-risk patients was significantly shorter than that of low-risk patients (P < 0.001). Univariate and multivariate factors indicate that risk scores can be used as independent prognostic factors for patients with HCC. Multiple receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plots show that the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the risk score is higher than that of other clinical features. The C-index of our nomogram was 0.768. Conclusion: The PI model has a prognostic efficacy superior to that of other clinical features. Keywords: macrophage-associated lncRNAs, The Cancer Genome Atlas, prognosis index model, liver hepatocellular carcinoma\nIntroduction Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers and the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths.1 Although progress has been made in early diagnosis and treatment, the prognosis of HCC remains poor, with a median survival of 6\u201320 months.2 Therefore, new prognostic models providing more powerful prognostic biomarkers for patients with liver cancer are urgently needed.\nTumours are composed of not only cancer cells but also a series of stromal cells, such as tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs), which may regulate tumour growth and development, angiogenesis and adaptive immunity.3 Macrophages are immune cells derived from embryonic precursors and circulating CD14 + monocytes derived from bone marrow.

Macrophages that promote Th1-type inflammatory response and have microbicidal and tumour-killing activities are called M1 macrophages (also known as classically activated macrophages). M2 macrophages (also known as activated macrophages) are immunomodulators with almost no microbicidal activity can reside and proliferate in tissues and support Th2-mediated diseases, homeostasis and heat generation.4\u20136 Although both M1 and M2 macrophages have been observed in tumours, evidence suggests that M2 macrophages are the main subtype found in tumours and tend to promote tumour progression.7,8 Moreover, studies have shown that the number of TAMs (mainly M2 macrophages) in tumour tissue is related to the poor prognosis of patients and tumour development.9,10\nThere is evidence that long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) regulates many cell and developmental processes, including cell proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation.11\u201313 Abnormal expression of lncRNA is related to pathophysiological conditions, including diabetes, cancer, tissue fibrosis and cardiovascular diseases.14\u201316 Although efforts have been made to understand the mechanism of lncRNA in regulating gene expression, little progress has been made in studying the function of lncRNA in macrophages.17,18 Considering the important role of macrophages and lncRNA in tumours, we measured the expression of lncRNA in macrophages during the polarisation process from the M2 phenotype to the M1 phenotype.\nIn this study, microarrays were used to detect the differential expression of lncRNA in M1 and M2 macrophages. Subsequently, we screened eight lncRNAs from differentially expressed lncRNAs based on the previous study of our research group. Subsequently, we verified the expression of the eight lncRNAs in 251 pairs of matched HCC tissues and adjacent normal tissues using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and further analysed their correlation with clinicopathological parameters and overall survival (OS) of 251 patients with HCC. Finally, we developed a new model based on the eight lncRNAs, which can provide more powerful prognostic biomarkers for patients with liver cancer."

However, due to the small number of useful biomarkers, we usually cannot predict the effects of treatment. The malignant behaviour of HCC is a complex and precise process that requires the abnormal expression of specific genes to provide cancer cells the corresponding ability.23\u201325 Therefore, changes affecting the prognosis of patients with HCC may occur long before the detectable clinical pathological abnormalities, highlighting the important role of prognostic biomarkers in treating patients with HCC.\nThis is the first study that has established a macrophage-associated prognostic model for HCC. In this study, we used microarrays to detect the differential expression of lncRNAs in M1 and M2 macrophages. Subsequently, we screened eight lncRNAs from differentially expressed lncRNAs and constructed a PI model. The previous study of our group has shown that some lncRNAs are related to the prognosis of HCC.26\u201328 Furthermore, some lncRNAs were involved in the occurrence of various cancers, such as colorectal cancer and nasopharyngeal carcinoma.29,30 Bioinformatics analyses were performed to elucidate the possible mechanisms of the eight MALs in HCC. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of these genes was further performed. These genes were\nsignificantly enriched in spliceosomes, ubiquitinmediated proteolysis, cell cycle and endocytosis, among others. These pathways have been reported to be related to HCC.31,32\nClinical staging is essential as it helps in making decisions regarding available treatment options. Although there are some new HCC staging systems have been developed in different parts of the world, such as the Cancer of the Liver Italian Programme (CLIP) score, Model to Estimate Survival in Ambulatory HCC patients (MESIAH) score and BCLC staging.33 However, there is no globally accepted staging system because all systems are developed based on different populations and only perform well in similar populations. The BCLC staging system is considered the most comprehensive, considering all basic clinical parameters, and provides prognostic guidance for available treatment options. However, it represents only a treatment decision algorithm but not a prognostic evaluation.34 The later-developed classification systems have their inherent limitations and need further external validation in different population cohorts.35,36 In this study, we compared the ability of the PI model with clinical staging systems, such as BCLC and TMN, and other clinical features to assess the prognosis of liver cancer. The results indicate that the use of the risk model of the eight MALs improves the ability to predict survival in patients with HCC compared with the use of clinical factors.\nThe most significant advantage of this study is the universal applicability of the eight MALs in prognostic prediction because the robustness of our model has been verified in an independent dataset. The use of paired and unpaired HCC samples from TCGA database strictly guarantees the specificity and representativeness of MALs. More importantly, the MALs used for prognostic evaluation are also key lncRNAs for predicting the occurrence and development of HCC.\nThis study has some limitations. First, this was a retrospective study, so the findings in this study should be tested prospectively. Second, although we performed enrichment analysis to identify potential pathways, we did not validate these pathways. Despite these limitations, our results showed that the moderate prognostic efficacy of the PI model is better than that of other clinical features."
