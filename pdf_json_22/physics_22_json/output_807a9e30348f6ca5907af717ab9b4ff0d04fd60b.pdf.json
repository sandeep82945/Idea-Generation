( 2022 ) presented an additional paper on the modelling of 2020cxd.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/513/4/4983/6576341 by C onsejo Superior de Investigaciones C ientificas (C SIC ) user on 26 Septem ber 2022\nnd even authentic, though weak, Core-Collapse SNe. In particular, aint SNe explosions are expected to be produced when the subnergetic explosion of a very massive star leads to the fallback of the nner stellar mantle on to the core (Pumo et al. 2017 ). These SNe are haracterized by the ejection of tiny amounts of 56 Ni (e.g. Moriya t al. 2010 ). The collapse of an O\u2013Ne\u2013Mg core of a moderate\u2013mass uper-AGB star is also expected to produce faint transients known as lectron-capture SNe (ECSNe) (e.g. Nomoto 1984 ; Ritossa, Garciaerro & Iben 1996 ; Kitaura, Janka & Hillebrandt 2006 ; Poelarends t al. 2008 ), although there is no consensus yet on whether we have aleady witnessed such an e xplosion. Giv en their faintness and low synhesized 56 Ni mass, the so-called Intermediate-Luminosity Red Tranients (ILRTs; Botticella et al. 2009 ; Stritzinger et al. 2020 ; Cai et al. 021 ) are considered to be among the most promising candidates. he electron-capture SN scenario, ho we ver, can potentially produce ransients with different observable properties. The peculiar type II N 2018zd (Hiramatsu et al. 2021 ) has shown a remarkable comatibility with the ECSN scenario, although no consensus has been eached yet on the nature of this object (Zhang et al. 2020 ; Callis et al. 021 ). Together with this array of unusual and little-studied transients, here is a group of Low Luminosity SNe type IIP (LL SNe IIP) ying towards the upper end of the \u2018luminosity gap\u2019, showing plateau bsolute magnitude M V typically between \u221214 and \u221215 mag. The rst identified object of this class was SN 1997D (Turatto et al. 1998 ; enetti et al. 2001 ), which was reported as one of the faintest SN bserved to that date, peaking at M V = \u221214.65 mag. The late time ecline was also unusually faint, compatible with the ejection of just \u00d7 10 \u22123 M of 56 Ni, one order of magnitude lower than the typical alue for standard SNe IIP (a few 10 \u22122 M , Anderson et al. 2014 ). he first scenario proposed to explain this event envisioned a massive rogenitor (25\u201340 M ), and the fallback on the black hole formed uring the collapse would account for the low amount of energy mitted (Zampieri, Shapiro & Colpi 1998 ; Zampieri et al. 2003 ). mportant steps towards understanding the nature of LL SNe IIP rogenitors were taken thanks to observational studies on samples f standard type IIP SNe (Smartt et al. 2009 ; Smartt 2015 ), which etermined that the progenitor stars of SNe IIP were Red Super iants (RSGs) with low Zero Age Main Sequence (ZAMS) masses etween 8 and 18 M . These findings disfa v oured the scenario of he massive progenitor for LL SNe IIP (Eldridge, Mattila & Smartt 007 ; Crockett et al. 2011 ; Fraser et al. 2011 ). This study was ased on the direct detections of the progenitor star in archi v al mages before the SN explosion, and subsequent matching with heoretical e volutionary tracks. A dif ferent approach to determine he progenitor mass consists in computing hydrodynamical models o describe observed light curves and expansion velocities (e.g. trobin, Chugai & Pastorello 2007 ; Utrobin & Chugai 2008 ; Bersten, envenuto & Hamuy 2011 ; Pumo & Zampieri 2011 ; Lisakov et al. 018 ; Kozyre v a et al. 2021 ; Martinez et al. 2021 ). The mass estimates btained with this method (14\u201318 M ) do not reproduce the lower nd of the mass distribution observed through direct progenitor etection, possibly due to an o v erestimate of the ejected mass due o spherical symmetry approximation (Utrobin & Chugai 2009 ). here also exists a third approach (Fransson & Che v alier 1989 ; aguire et al. 2010 ; Jerkstrand et al. 2012 , 2014 , 2018 ; Lisakov t al. 2017 , 2018 ; Dessart et al. 2021 ): the nebular [OI] doublet \u03bb 6300 6364 observed in the late-time spectra is used as a tracer f the core mass of the progenitor star and hence of its ZAMS ass. The method described abo v e was dev eloped to study standard SNe IP, but it was also applied to LL SNe IIP, when possible. Spectral\nNRAS 513, 4983\u20134999 (2022)\nodelling results are so far consistent with the lack of massive rogenitors ( \u223c20 M ) for LL SNe IIP (M \u0308uller -Bra v o et al. 2020 ). tudies on the photometric and spectroscopic evolution of larger amples (up to 15 objects) of LL SNe IIP (Pastorello et al. 2004 ; piro et al. 2014 ) found that these transients share strikingly similar eatures. The light curves of LL SNe IIP are characterized by a quick ise to maximum (fe w days), follo wed by a plateau lasting \u223c100 d, efore finally settling on a late time linear decay compatible with he ejection of a small amount of 56 Ni ( < 10 \u22122 M ). The temperature volution is quite homogeneous among the various objects observed, ith a rapid cooling at early phases leading to a temperature of 0 4 K at 10 d, and a slower subsequent decline (6000\u20138000 K at 0 d). The expansion velocities inferred from the spectral lines also how a fast decrease from some 10 3 km s \u22121 in the first week after xplosion to \u223c 2000 km s \u22121 one month after. These findings are onsistent with those inferred for standard SNe IIP: transients with immer plateaus show lower expansion velocities and eject less 56 Ni Hamuy 2003 ; Guti \u0301errez et al. 2017b ). Pastorello et al. ( 2004 ) and piro et al. ( 2014 ) proposed that LL SNe IIP are the least energetic nd of the continuous distribution of SNe IIP in the parameter space progenitor mass, plateau luminosity, 56 Ni synthesized, expansion elocities). This proposition is corroborated by the presence of transitional\u2019 objects, showing intermediate properties between LL Ne IIP and standard SNe IIP, like SN 2009N (Tak \u0301ats et al. 2014 ) nd SN 2008in (Roy et al. 2011 ). Furthermore, Pumo et al. ( 2017 ) how that the parameter E/ M ej \u2018guide\u2019 the distribution of the SNe IP class in the parameters space, where LL SNe IIP form the nderluminous tail. In the context of LL SNe IIP, we present photometric and pectroscopic data that we collected for two objects belonging to his class: SN 2020cxd, 1 one of the faintest LL SNe IIP observed to ate, and SN 2021aai, which belongs to the brighter end of the class. n Section 2 , we discuss the methodology used to obtain and reduce he data, while in Section 3 , the photometric data are presented. In ection 4 , we analyse the spectra, and in Section 5 , we discuss the hysical parameters obtained through blackbody fits. In Section 6 , we stimate the 56 Ni ejected mass during the explosion and compare the esults with similar objects. In Section 7 , we perform hydrodynamic odelling on our targets in order to infer information about their rogenitor stars. Finally, in Section 8 , we summarize the results btained.\nDATA R E D U C T I O N\nhe objects in this paper were followed with several instruments t different facilities, whose details are reported in Table B1 .

Image reduction was performed hrough standard IRAF tasks (Tody 1986 ), removing the overscan and hen correcting for bias and flat-field.

SNOOPY is a collection of PYTHON scripts that all IRAF standard tasks like D AOPHO T through PYRAF , and it was esigned for Point Spread Function (PSF) fitting of multiwavelength ata acquired from different instruments and telescopes. The PSF odel was built from the profiles of isolated, unsaturated stars in the eld. The instrumental magnitude of the transient was then retrieved y fitting this PSF model and accounting for the background conribution around the target position through a low-order polynomial t. The error in this procedure was obtained through artificial stars reated close to the target, with magnitudes and profiles coincident ith those inferred for the object. The dispersion of the artificial stars nstrumental magnitudes was combined in quadrature with the PSF tting error given by D AOPHO T to obtain the total error associated ith that measure. Zero Point (ZP) and Colour Term (CT) corrections ere computed for each instrument by observing standard fields: the loan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) (Albareti et al. 2017 ) was used as reference for Sloan filters; the Landolt ( 1992 ) catalogue was used or Johnson filters; and the 2MASS (Skrutskie et al. 2006 ) catalogue as used for near infrared (NIR) filters. It is worth noting that in he NIR we assumed negligible CT, so we only computed the ZP orrection.\nIn order to account for non-photometric nights, we selected a series f stars in the field of each transient: by measuring the average magitude variation of the reference stars with respect to the catalogued agnitudes, we computed the ZP correction for each night in each filer. Applying ZP and CT corrections to the instrumental magnitudes f our targets, we obtained the apparent magnitudes reported in this aper. We adopted the AB magnitudes system for ugriz bands and ega magnitudes for BVJHK bands. For the \u2018Asteroid Terrestrialmpact Last Alert System\u2019 (ATLAS) data (Tonry et al. 2018 ), e combined the flux values obtained through forced photometry eported in their archive, 3 and converted the result into magnitudes s prescribed in the ATLAS webpage. Both objects discussed in this ork are well distinguishable from the surrounding environment. or this reason, we resorted to template subtraction only at very ate epochs, when the transients were too faint to be detected therwise. The template subtraction procedure was performed again ith SNOOPY , with template images taken from SDSS (Albareti et al. 017 ). The photometric measurements we obtained are reported in ppendix B . The original spectra presented in this work (see Table 1 ) were educed through standard IRAF routines contained in the package TIOSLIT . All spectra were corrected for bias and flat-field before xtracting the one-dimensional (1D) spectrum. Sky lines and cosmic ays were remo v ed, and wav elength and flux calibrations were pplied using arc lamps and spectrophotometric standard stars. inally, spectra were corrected for telluric lines, they were flux alibrated an additional time on the broad-band photometric data btained at the same phase, and they were corrected for redshift nd reddening (discussed in Section 3 ). In particular, spectra taken ith the NOT were reduced through the ALFOSCGUI 4 pipeline Cappellaro 2014 ), specifically designed to reduce spectra within he NUTS2 collaboration.

In this paper, we adopt a istance modulus of \u03bc = 31.60 \u00b1 0.20 mag (or 20.9 \u00b1 1.9 Mpc), y averaging the six different estimates obtained using the Tully\u2013 isher method and reported on the NED data base (Bottinelli et al. 985 ; Tully & Fisher 1988 ; Willick et al. 1997 ; Tully et al. 2013 ; orce et al. 2014 ; Tully, Courtois & Sorce 2016 ). We assumed a osmology where H 0 = 73 km s \u22121 Mpc \u22121 , = 0.73 and M 0.27 (Spergel et al. 2007 ), which will be used throughout this ork. The Galactic absorption in the direction of NGC 6395 is V = 0.11 \u00b1 0.03 mag, from Schlafly & Finkbeiner ( 2011 ), under he assumption that R V = 3.1 (Cardelli, Clayton & Mathis 1989 ; hich will be used throughout this work). Early spectra do not show vidence of the interstellar Na I D absorption doublet at the host alaxy redshift, implying a ne gligible e xtinction along the line of ight (see Section 4 ).\nIn Fig. 1 , we report the multiwavelength photometry of SN 020cxd collected up to 230 d after explosion. The early rise in uminosity was not observed, since the object was first detected hen it was already on the plateau. Ho we ver, thanks to a deep upper imit ( r > 20.3 mag) obtained just 3 d before the disco v ery by the wick y Transient F acility (ZTF; Graham et al. 2019 ), it is possible o constrain the explosion epoch with small uncertainty to MJD 58897.0 \u00b1 1.5. Even on the plateau, the brightness was not strictly onstant: at first, there was a decline, with the transient dimming rom M r = \u201314.13 mag at 10 d to M r = \u201314.00 mag at 22 d (typical hotometric error of 0.21 mag). This luminosity decrease was more arked in the blue bands. This behaviour is clear in the g band, here the absolute magnitude declined from M g = \u201313.97 mag o M g = \u201313.20 mag in the first 60 d. Thereafter, the brightness onsistently increased to M g = \u201313.58 mag and M r = \u201314.48 mag efore finally fading from the plateau at \u223c120 d.

The drop from the lateau was very sharp, with the object fading by 2.9 mag in the r and and 3.2 mag in the g band in just 10 d. Finally, the luminosity volution settled on a linear decline powered by the 56 Ni synthesized uring the explosion. More details about the estimate of the 56 Ni jected are given in Section 5 . .2 SN 2021aai photometric properties N 2021aai was disco v ered at the coordinates RA = 07 h 14 m 26 s . 86 ec = + 84 \u25e6 22\u2019 51\u201d.46 on 2021 January 12 (Munoz-Arancibia t al. 2021 ) in NGC 2268, an SAB(r)bc (de Vaucouleurs et al. 991 ) at a redshift of z = 0.007428 \u00b1 0.000007 (Springob et al. 005 ) and quickly classified as a LL SN IIP (Re guitti, P astorello & alerin 2021b ). Throughout this work, we adopt a distance modulus f \u03bc = 32.47 \u00b1 0.20 mag (31.2 \u00b1 2.9 Mpc), obtained through ne of the most recent Tully\u2013Fisher estimates (Tully et al. 2013 ). ccording to Schlafly & Finkbeiner ( 2011 ), the reddening internal\no the Milky Way along the line of sight towards NGC 2268 is V = 0.170 \u00b1 0.003 mag. Unlike in SN 2020cxd, the Na I D bsorption doublet was detected in the first two spectra obtained see Section 4 ), with an Equi v alent Width (EW) of 1.6 \u00c5. Some elationships between reddening and Na I D EW typically saturate ith such high values of EW (Poznanski, Prochaska & Bloom 012 ), so we estimate a lower limit to the absorption along the ine of sight through the relationship provided in Turatto, Benetti & appellaro ( 2003 ) for \u2018low reddening\u2019, obtaining a total absorption long the line of sight of A V = 0.8 \u00b1 0.1 mag. At the same time, e tried to make use of the homogeneity observed for this class f objects during the plateau (Pastorello et al. 2004 ; Spiro et al. 014 ): we estimated the absorption necessary to bring the colour volution of SN 2021aai closest to the colour evolution of a sample f LL SNe IIP (taken from Matheson et al. 2003 ; Pastorello et al. 004 , 2009 ) between 30 and 100 d. Similar procedures were already erformed, for example for SN 2001dc (Pastorello et al. 2004 ). hrough the method of the least squares, we obtained an absorption f A V = 1.92 \u00b1 0.06 mag ( A V = 2.09 \u00b1 0.06 mag, accounting for he internal reddening of the Milky Way), which will be referred ereafter as \u2018high reddening scenario\u2019. To compare the colour volution of SN 2021aai with the LL SNe IIP colours available in\nNRAS 513, 4983\u20134999 (2022)\nhe chosen sample, we converted the r magnitudes (AB magnitudes ystem) into Johnson R magnitudes (Vega magnitude system) by pplying a constant correction measured through spectrophotometry we adopt r \u2212 R = 0.28 mag, the average value measured during the lateau phase). The apparent light curves obtained during the six months of ollo w\u2013up are sho wn in Fig. 2 . The rise to maximum was not bserved, but the explosion epoch was well constrained at MJD 59223.4 \u00b1 1.0, thanks to an upper limit ( r > 20.5 mag) obtained y ZTF just 2 d before the first detection. The plateau phase was nusually long-lasting, with a duration of 140 d: a tentative physical xplanation will be discussed in Section 7 . During the plateau, the band displays a progressive brightening, spanning from \u221215.87 to 16.57 mag ( \u00b10.23 mag) in the high reddening scenario and from 14.77 to \u201315.47 mag in the low reddening scenario. A similar ehaviour is recorded in the NIR, where the transient became 1 mag righter in the J , H , and K bands from 13 to 130 d. The g band volution of SN 2021aai was different, with the transient reaching peak magnitude of \u201316.41 (\u201314.84) mag at 5 d after the explosion, nd then settling on a constant value of \u201315.68 (\u201314.11) mag up until he fall from the plateau in the high (low) reddening scenario. During he fall from the plateau, which was well-sampled in the r and i bands, here was a marked drop of 2.88 mag in 16 d.\n.3 Comparison with the LL SNe IIP class\ne compare SNe 2020cxd and 2021aai with LL SNe II and a borderine standard SN IIP that have good photometric and spectroscopic o v erage. F or this reason, we choose SN 1999br (Pastorello et al. 004 ), SN 1999em (Hamuy et al. 2001 ), SN 2003Z (Spiro et al. 2014 ), N 2005cs (Pastorello et al. 2009 ), SN 2010id (Gal-Yam et al. 2011 ), nd SN 2018hwm (Reguitti et al. 2021a ). In Fig. 3 , we plot the R band ight curves for the chosen sample of faint SNe IIP. We convert the loan r magnitudes of SN 2018hwm, SN 2020cxd, and SN 2021aai to ohnson R magnitudes by applying the constant correction discussed bo v e for SN 2021aai ( r \u2212 R = 0.16 mag for SN 2020cxd, r \u2212 R 0.23 mag for SN 2018hwm). While relatively brighter objects like N 2005cs or SN 2018hwm display a plateau at M r \u223c\u201315 mag, SN 020cxd lies towards the low luminosity end of core-collapse events, arked by the faint SN 1999br. SN 2021aai is located towards the righter end of the peak luminosity distribution, especially in the high\nr 1 i H e t r d S c p ( w t p p b 2 a \u223c S e\no L h a i r t b t W a b a t h r t\nFigure 4.

The difference in the plateau luminosity can be physically nterpreted as a different mass and density profile of the recombining powering the light curve, a different expansion velocity of the jected gas, or a different initial radius of the exploding star. During he first 50 d of evolution, the light curve of SN 2020cxd closely esembles that of SN 2010id. Ho we v er, the two light curv es become ifferent after \u223c50 d, when SN 2020cxd shows a rebrightening while N 2010id starts to fade. Indeed, both SNe 2020cxd and 2021aai are haracterized by an increase of brightness towards the end of the lateau. This behaviour is not unheard of, as shown by Galbany et al. 2016 ), and it is more common in the red bands of faint transients ith long plateau phases. Indeed, the plateau of SN 2021aai is among he longest observed with a duration of 140 d, outlasting even the eculiar SN 2009ib (Tak \u0301ats et al. 2015 ). For context, the average lateau duration for an SN IIP is 83.7 \u00b1 16.7 d (obtained for the V and by Anderson et al. 2014 ). In the low reddening scenario, SN 021aai shows a late time brightness close to those of 2018hwm nd 2003Z, while in the high reddening scenario, SN 2021aai is only 0.4 mag fainter than the standard event 1999em. On the other hand, N 2020cxd displays one of the faintest late time declines observed, ven for LL SNe. In Fig. 4 , we display the B \u2212 V and V \u2212 R colour evolution f SNe 2020cxd and 2021aai along with the colours observed for L SNe IIP. Qualitatively, the behaviour of LL SNe IIP is quite omogeneous, as was already shown by Spiro et al. ( 2014 ). After rapid increase in colour during the first 50 d ( \u223c 1.5 mag increase n B \u2212 V and \u223c0.5 mag increase in V \u2212 R ), the colours remain oughly constant up to \u223c120 d, when SNe IIP typically fall from he plateau, leading to a final increase in colour as the transients ecome redder. The g \u2212 r colour curve of SN 2020cxd, reported in he appendix (Fig. B1 ), shows an interesting behaviour after 120 d.\ne observe a steep increase in colour during the fall from the plateau, nd a subsequent inversion in the trend as the colour g \u2212 r becomes luer. Such feature was pointed out for the first time for SNe 1997D nd 1999eu (Pastorello et al. 2004 ). As for SN 2021aai, it is possible o appreciate the difference in the colour evolution for the low and igh reddening scenarios, respectively. By construction, in the high eddening scenario, the behaviour of SN 2021aai resembles that of he other LL SNe IIP.\nSPECTROSCOPIC E VO L U T I O N\n.1 Spectr oscopic featur es\nigs 5 and 6 show the spectral sequences for SNe 2020cxd and 021aai. The log of the spectroscopic observations is reported in able 1 . In the first two spectra of SN 2020cxd, we notice a blue ontinuum: a blackbody fit yields a temperature of 10000 K at d, which quickly declined to 8000 K at 9 d. Both spectra display rominent Balmer lines and few weaker lines, such as He I and Na ID isplaying a P Cygni profile. The absence of the interstellar sodium bsorption doublet leads us to estimate the internal absorption in he host galaxy as negligible. At 30 d, we notice the emergence f several new features: the Ca II NIR triplet ( \u03bb\u03bb\u03bb8498,8542,8662) ppears on the red part of the spectrum (Fig. 5 ). On the blue part of he spectrum, several metal lines are identified, especially those of e II triplet 42 ( \u03bb\u03bb\u03bb4924,5018,5169), Sc II ( \u03bb\u03bb5669,6246), and Ba II \u03bb\u03bb6142,6497). We note that the absorption dip on top of the H \u03b1 ine that is visible in the spectra is due to an e xcessiv e subtraction f the host galaxy in the background. Some of the most prominent etal lines are highlighted in Fig. 7 , where it is also possible to ppreciate the similarities between the spectra of SN 2020cxd and N 2021aai. The spectral features mentioned so far are e xtensiv ely observ ed n LL SNe (Pastorello et al. 2004 ; Spiro et al. 2014 ; M \u0308uller -Bra v o t al. 2020 ; Reguitti et al. 2021a ). The presence of a rele v ant amount f metals gives rise to \u2018line blanketing\u2019, where the flux in the bluest art of the spectrum is reduced by the metal absorption lines (see e.g. oriya, Mazzali & Tanaka 2019 ). For this reason, when estimating he blackbody temperature from the continuum, it is important to\nMNRAS 513, 4983\u20134999 (2022)\nM\ne t b i s t p\no p a s a r b p t 2 2 T t o b 4 v w\nFigure 6.

Taking this effect into account, the lackbody fit of the continuum at 31 d yields a temperature of 5460 K, n line with the expectations for H recombination. The last two pectra are taken after the drop from the plateau, during the late ail decline, when the [Ca II ] doublet and Ca II NIR triplet become rominent. In Fig. 6 , we present the spectral evolution of SN2021aai. We btained a high quality sampling of the target during the plateau hase, but unfortunately it was impossible to follow the object fter the fall from the plateau due to visibility constraints. The first pectrum, at 8 d, is dominated by H lines. The interstellar Na I D bsorption doublet is identified, suggesting a significant line of sight eddening towards SN 2021aai (see Section 3 ). At later phases, the road Na I D feature develops a clear P Cygni profile, at the same hases when the Ca II NIR triplet and the metal lines appear in he spectra. In Fig. 7 , we compare the spectra at \u223c 30 d of SN 020cxd and SN 2021aai with SN 1999br (Pastorello et al. 2004 ), SN 005cs (Pastorello et al. 2009 ), and SN 1999em (Hamuy et al. 2001 ). he similarity among this sample of objects is striking, considering\nhat they span over two magnitudes in peak luminosity. Besides the bvious P Cygni profile of H \u03b1, all the objects are characterized y evident Ca ii NIR triplet lines, Sc II \u03bb6246 and Fe II multiplet 2 ( \u03bb\u03bb\u03bb4924 5018 5169). The differences lie, of course, in the line elocities: the position of the minimum of the P Cygni profile and the idth of the H \u03b1 feature in SN 1999em suggests a significantly higher\nNRAS 513, 4983\u20134999 (2022)\nxpansion v elocity for this object, which separates this standard SN IP from the other LL SNe shown.\n.2 Expansion velocities\ne estimate the velocity of the expanding gas by measuring the osition of the minimum of the P Cygni absorption profiles. Different pecies yield different e xpansion v elocities, reflecting a different osition where the line forms through the ejecta (Guti \u0301errez et al. 017a ). Due to higher optical depth, H \u03b1 and H \u03b2 lines form in he outer layers of the expanding materials, therefore yielding igher velocities than other species. Fe II lines, especially those elonging to multiplet 42, have a lower optical depth, and have een widely used to estimate the e xpansion v elocity of the ejecta t the photosphere (Hamuy 2003 ). The Sc II line \u03bb6246 displays an ven lo wer optical depth, and is sometimes used as a proxy for xpansion v elocity instead of the Fe II lines (e.g. Maguire et al. 010 ). For SN 2020cxd in particular, the velocity measurements erformed on the H \u03b1 line showed that the line forming region o v es in v elocity space monotonically from 5900 km s \u22121 at 2 d, o 2560 km s \u22121 immediately after the drop from the plateau (134 d), nd finally to 1020 km s \u22121 at 245 d. The H \u03b1 e xpansion v elocity after 0 d is measured from the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of he line, since the rise of the Ba II \u03bb 6497 makes it impossible to dentify clearly the position of the minimum of the P Cygni profile. he results are reported in Table 2 and plotted in Fig. 8 , along with\nFigure 7. Comparison of SN 2020cxd and SN 2021aai together with LL SNe IIP (SN 1999br and SN 2005cs) and a standard event (SN 1999em). All spectra were collected between 30 and 36 d after explosion and corrected for redshift and reddening (in the high reddening scenario for SN 2021aai).

( 2004 ), astorello et al. ( 2009 ), and Spiro et al. ( 2014 ). From the comparison ith similar objects, we notice that SN 2020cxd displays low H \u03b1 nd Sc II expansion velocities in the early phases (before 50 d), ompatible with the values obtained for SN 1999br (Pastorello et al. 004 ). Later epoch v alues, ho we ver, appear to be more in line with igher velocity objects like SN 2006ov (Spiro et al. 2014 ). It is mportant to notice, especially for the Sc II measurements at 95 d, hat the resolution of the spectrum was poor, leading to a large rror.\nFor SN 2021aai, the velocities measured from the H \u03b1 P Cygni rofiles range from 7000 km s \u22121 at 8 d to 4200 km s \u22121 at 35 d. ubsequently, the rise of the Ba II \u03bb 6497 line in the absorption part of he P Cygni profile forces us to estimate the expansion velocities from he FWHM of the emission component of the H \u03b1 line, as previously\none by Yang et al. ( 2021 ) for SN 2020cxd. As already mentioned, etal lines are characterized by a lower optical depth, leading to heir formation closer to the photosphere compared to H lines, which orm in the outer layers of the ejecta and therefore yield higher elocity measurements. Both H \u03b1 and Sc II expansion velocities for N 2021aai are shown in Fig. 8 . SN 2021aai shows high velocities oth in the H I and Sc II measurements, located consistently at the top nd of the velocity distribution for the sample of objects considered. ince it is also among the most luminous LL SNe (adopting the high eddening scenario), this would fa v our the interpretation in which Ne IIP are characterized by a continuum of properties, spanning rom LL SNe IIP to the most luminous ones, with brighter objects howing higher velocities and a larger ejected 56 Ni mass, as suggested y Pastorello et al.

It is rele v ant to note that when stimating the temperature after \u223c30 d, we exclude the regions heavly affected by line blanketing since they would misleadingly reduce he estimated temperature: therefore we rely on V , r , o , i , z bands.\nhen estimating the bolometric luminosity, instead, at each epoch, e performed the blackbody fit on all the available pass-band fluxes. inally, the radius is estimated through the Stefan\u2013Boltzmann law.

At 121 d, the temperature starts eclining, along with the luminosity, as the object fades from the lateau. The bolometric luminosity of SN 2020cxd is presented in the iddle panel of Fig. 9 and shows a clear dip from 2.4 \u00d7 10 41 erg s \u22121 t 2 d to 1.0 \u00d7 10 41 erg s \u22121 at 22 d. During the following 90 d the ransient steadily rebrightens, reaching 1.9 \u00d7 10 41 erg s \u22121 at 111 d, efore finally falling from the plateau at 120 d. The radius (bottom anel) of the emitting blackbody quickly rises from 7 to 26 au in he first 30 d, followed by a slower increase. Between 50 and 120 d, he emitting radius remains roughly constant at \u223c35 au. When SN 020cxd is fading from the plateau, the radius shows a decrease, hich can be interpreted as the photosphere receding before the jecta finally becomes transparent. We do not fit a blackbody to the pochs in the linear decline, as the transient is transitioning from the hotospheric to the nebular phase, where the luminosity is mostly upported by lines rather than continuum opacity.\nFor SN 2021aai, we discuss both the low reddening case with V = 0.8 mag, obtained through the Na I D doublet absorption EW, nd the high reddening case with A V = 1.9 mag, obtained through he colour comparison with other LL SNe IIP. The low reddening cenario is characterized by lower temperatures at all epochs, with a lateau temperature of only 4300 K. The high reddening scenario is uch more promising in this situation, since the plateau temperature f SN 2021aai o v erlaps with the rest of the sample, at around 5500K. n particular, SN 2021aai in the high reddening case displays the ame temperature evolution as SN 2005cs, and it is only marginally righter when considering the bolometric luminosity. The clearest ifference between the two objects is the duration of the plateau: or SN 2005cs, the plateau ends \u223c120 d after the explosion, but he luminosity starts fading by \u223c75 d. SN 2021aai, on the other and, is definitely longer-lasting. In the high reddening scenario, its olometric luminosity has an early peak (7.2 \u00d7 10 41 erg s \u22121 ), similar o the other LL SNe IIP considered. After a few weeks of dimming, N 2021aai luminosity increases from 4.3 \u00d7 10 41 erg s \u22121 at 25 d to .5 \u00d7 10 41 erg s \u22121 at 130 d before the fall from its plateau. On the ther hand, in the low reddening scenario, there is no evidence of he early luminosity peak, and the bolometric luminosity steadily ncreases from 1.9 \u00d7 10 41 erg s \u22121 to 3.6 \u00d7 10 41 erg s \u22121 during the lateau phase. Unfortunately, we do not have enough multiband bservations or spectra during the first 10 d to perform a blackbody t to confirm if the similarity between SN 2021aai (in the high eddening scenario) and SN 2005cs is present in the earliest phases. he larger luminosity of SN 2021aai compared to SN 2020cxd leads o an estimate of a larger radius, given that their plateau temperature as comparable. While starting off with similar values, the emitting adius of SN 2021aai grows much more than the one of SN 2020cxd, p to 95 au at 143 d after the explosion. This behaviour appears to e unusual, compared to the other objects, where the radius varies ignificantly less during the plateau phase.\n56 N I ESTIMATE\nhe late tail of the light curve of SNe IIP is powered by the 56 Ni \u2192 6 Co \u2192 56 Fe decay chain, which deposits energy into the expanding as in the form of photons and positrons (Colgate & McKee 1969 ). e estimate the ejected mass of 56 Ni through a comparison of the ate time luminosity with the well studied SN 1987A, as previously one for other LL SNe IIP (e.g. Pastorello et al. 2004 ; Spiro et al. 014 ; Tomasella et al. 2018 ), through the following equation:\n( 56 Ni) SN = M ( 56 Ni) 1987 A \u00d7 L SN L , (1)\n1987 A\nhere we adopt a value for the 56 Ni ejected mass by SN 1987A f 0.073 \u00b1 0.012 M , which is the weighted average of the values eported in Arnett & Fu ( 1989 ) and Bouchet, Danziger & Lucy 1991 ). Due to a lack of information in the NIR during the late ecline, we have to perform some approximations. We compare he integrated luminosity in the observed bands ( r , i , z) for our bjects with the luminosity integrated through the same wavelength anges for SN 1987A (since SDSS filters were not available at the ime). With this method, we obtain for SN 2020cxd (1.8 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 0 \u22123 M of synthesized 56 Ni, quite low compared to the typical value f few 10 \u22122 M for an SN IIP event (see, for example M ( 56 Ni) avg 0.033 \u00b1 0.024 M , obtained by Anderson et al. 2014 ). For SN 021aai, we obtain a value of (7.5 \u00b1 2.5) \u00d7 10 \u22123 M for the low eddening scenario and (1.4 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 10 \u22122 M for the high reddening cenario, which is still a factor of 2 below the average SN IIP event eported by Anderson et al. ( 2014 ).\nIn Fig. 10 , we display the locations of SN 2020cxd and SN 2021aai n the diagrams comparing peak magnitude versus 56 Ni ejected mass,\nMNRAS 513, 4983\u20134999 (2022)\nM\na ( b b t t w d t o\n7\n7\nI 2 E p w 2 2 a v i o t c d q o ( r p t c s n a a t a S\n7\nA c p ( t d a p r m p M 1 r M\nFigure 11.

In the top panel, the bolometric luminosity is displayed. In the middle panel, the photospheric velocity obtained through the ScII lines as described in Section 4 . Notice that the second velocity measurement is affected by a large error due to poor spectral resolution, as displayed in Fig. 8 : for this reason a percentage error of 45 per cent is shown to account for the difference between that measure and the model. Finally, the temperature evolution is shown in the bottom panel.\nFigure 12. Same as Fig. 11 , but for SN 2021aai in the high reddening scenario.

At the same time, the bolometric luminosity shows a more extended plateau compared to our fit.\nc T a i m p d r m c t\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/513/4/4983/6576341 by C onsejo Superior de Investigaciones C ientificas (C SIC ) user on 26 Septem ber 2022\nnd peak magnitude versus expansion velocity, as done by Hamuy 2003 ) for SNe IIP. As we can see, there is no clear separation etween standard and LL SNe IIP, but rather a smooth transition etween the two classes. According to the classification adopted in he literature, SN 2021aai in the high reddening scenario would be in he transition region between low luminosity and standard objects, hen considering the 56 Ni ejected mass. Instead, SN 2020cxd is efinitely in the lowest end of the parameter spectrum. Considering he expansion velocities measured with Sc II \u03bb6246, instead, both bjects display average values for LL SNe IIP.\nH Y D RO DY NA M I C A L M O D E L L I N G\n.1 Model details\nn order to estimate the physical properties of SNe 2020cxd and 021aai at the explosion time (progenitor radius R, explosion energy , total ejected mass M ej ), we use the hydrodynamical modelling rocedure presented in detail in Pumo et al. ( 2017 ), and already ell\u2013tested on both faint and standard SNe IIP (e.g. Spiro et al. 014 ; Tak \u0301ats et al. 2014 ; Tomasella et al. 2018 ; Reguitti et al. 021a ). The procedure consists of a simultaneous \u03c72 minimization iming at reproducing the observed bolometric luminosity, expansion elocity and photospheric temperature. This operation is performed n two distinct steps. Firstly, a preliminary investigation is carried ut through the model presented by Zampieri et al. ( 2003 ), solving he energy balance equation under the assumptions of ejecta with onstant density in homologous expansion. The parameters obtained uring this first fit lay down the framework on which the subseuent detailed calculations are based. The second step makes use f a general-relativistic, radiation-hydrodynamics Lagrangian code Pumo, Zampieri & Turatto 2010 ; Pumo & Zampieri 2011 ), which eproduces the main observables of the SN, from the onset of the lateau phase up to the nebular phase. The code takes into account he gravitational effects of the compact remnant left by the core ollapse and the energy input from the decay of radioactive isotopes ynthesized during the explosion. It is important to note that we did ot try to reproduce the early phase of the explosions ( \u223c 15\u201320 d fter explosion), since temperature and luminosity during this phase re significantly affected by emission from the outermost shell of he ejecta, which is not in homologous expansion, rendering the ssumptions in our model inaccurate. The best-fitting models for Ne 2020cxd and 2021aai are shown in Figs 11 and 12 , respectively.\n.2 SN 2020cxd results and progenitor scenarios\ndopting the 56 Ni masses inferred in Section 6 and the wellonstrained explosion epochs in Section 3 , we find the initial arameters of the progenitor of SN 2020cxd to be: R = 4 \u00d7 10 13 cm \u223c575 R ), M ej = 7.5 M , and E = 0.097 foe (sum of kinetic and hermal energy). The errors on the free model parameters reported ue to the \u03c72 fitting procedure are about 15 per cent for M ej and R , nd 30 per cent for E . To obtain the main sequence (MS) mass of the rogenitor star of SN 2020cxd, we need to account for the compact emnant produced by the core collapse (1.3\u20132.0 M ) as well as the ass lost during the pre\u2013SN evolutionary phases ( 0.1\u20130.9 M , as rescribed in Pumo et al. 2017 ). Considering these corrections, the S mass of the progenitor of SN 2020cxd is estimated to be 8.9\u2013 0.4 M . We note that despite the different methodology applied, our esults are consistent with those obtained by Kozyre v a et al. ( 2022 ): ej = 7.4 M , E = 0.07 foe, and R = 408 R .\nNRAS 513, 4983\u20134999 (2022)\nThe parameters estimated through hydrodynamical modelling are ompatible with what is expected for a red supergiant (RSG) star. he radius is within the 500\u20131500 R range associated with RSG, lthough leaning towards the lower end of the distribution, as reported n the re vie w of Smartt ( 2009 ). Furthermore, the progenitor initial\nass is just abo v e the 8 \u00b1 1 M threshold that defines the minimum rogenitor mass needed to produce an SN explosion, based on direct etections of RSG progenitors of SNe IIP (Smartt 2009 ). For these easons, SN 2020cxd could be explained by the explosion of a low ass RSG, resulting in the emission of a limited amount of energy ompared to the explosion of more massive RSG. This corroborates he scenario where more massive RSG explode in SNe that are\nFigure 13. Correlations between the plateau luminosity (top panel) and 56 Ni mass (bottom panel) with the E/ M ej ratio. LL SNe are coloured in green, standard SN IIP are shown in blue, while transitional objects are displayed in red and black (Pumo et al. 2017 ; Tomasella et al. 2018 ).

In this context, we display in ig. 13 the correlation between the plateau luminosity and 56 Ni ith the parameter E/ M ej , as in Pumo et al. 2017 (see their table , figs 5 and 6), including also the two \u2018intermediate-luminosity\u2019 bjects presented in Tomasella et al. 2018 (i.e. SNe 2013K and 013am). Like in Pumo et al. 2017 (to which we refers for details), he error bars on the E/ M ej ratios are estimated by propagating the ncertainties on E and M ej , adopting a value of 30 per cent for the elative errors of E and 15 per cent for that of M ej . Both in the top nd bottom panels of Fig. 13 , SN 2020cxd is at the very end of the istribution of SN IIP, due to the low E/ M ej ratio inferred for the xplosion and the relatively low amount of 56 Ni synthesized. Considering its faint nature and the inferred best-fitting model arameters, SN 2020cxd also appears to be a fair candidate for being n ECSN from a super-asymptotic giant branch (super-AGB) star. he estimated mass of the progenitor is close to the upper limit of\nhe mass range typical of this class of stars, M mas (see Pumo et al. 009 and references therein). This seems to corroborate the results f Pumo et al. ( 2017 ), showing that some faint SNe IIP may also be xplained in terms of ECSNe involving massive super-AGB stars. To nvestigate this scenario in more detail, we compare the photometric nd spectroscopic properties of SN 2020cxd with those of other CSN candidates in Appendix A . We note, ho we ver, that we lack\nonclusi ve e vidence to confidently discriminate between an ECSN cenario and a standard faint SN IIP event with an RSG progenitor.\n.3 SN 2021aai results and progenitor scenarios\ne also perform hydrodynamic modelling of SN 2021aai in the igh reddening scenario, assuming it is the most reliable of the wo (Fig. 12 ). We obtained R = 4 \u00d7 10 13 cm ( \u223c575 R ), M ej 15.5 M , and E = 0.4 foe. Given the higher energy and ejected ass compared to SN 2020cxd, we fa v our the scenario where an SG explodes through an iron core collapse, excluding the ECSN rigin for SN 2021aai. Pumo et al. ( 2017 ) analyse a sample of objects ith physical properties in between those of LL SNe IIP and standard Ne IIP. This small group of transients includes SNe 2008in, 2009N, 009ib, and 2012A, with the subsequent addition of SNe 2013K nd 2013am (Tomasella et al. 2018 ). Their plateau magnitudes are ypically brighter than M r \u223c \u221216 mag, and the inferred 56 Ni mass ynthesized ( > 10 \u22122 M ) is comparable with that of standard IIP vents. Ho we ver, when considering the parameter E/ M ej , Pumo et al. 2017 ) note that these objects make up a transitional group which is abelled \u2018intermediate-luminosity\u2019 SNe IIP. In Fig. 13 , it is possible o appreciate that SN 2021aai belongs to this category of events hich bridge the classes of LL SNe IIP and standard SNe IIP. In articular, comparing SN 2021aai with SNe 2013K and 2013am, we ote that the three objects have similar plateau luminosity as well as imilar synthesized 56 Ni masses. Despite the different values for E nd M ej estimated from hydrodynamical modelling (0.34 foe, 0.4 foe nd 12 M , 11.5 M , respectively for SNe 2013K and 2013am), hen considering the ratio E/ M ej , the three objects appear to stick ogether, separated from both the standard IIP events and the LL SNe IP.\nAs we remark in Section 3 , this transient is characterized by an xtended plateau phase, lasting \u223c140 d. This feature is not well eproduced by our hydrodynamical model, which predicts a shorter lateau compared to observations (Fig. 12 , top panel). This difference etween the model and the observations could probably be explained n terms of a peculiar distribution of the 56 Ni within the ejected aterial. In f act, k eeping constant the basic parameters of the models i.e. M ej , R , E and the total amount of 56 Ni initially present in the jected env elope), different de grees of 56 Ni mixing primarily lead o different plateau durations (see e.g. Fig. 11 in Pumo & Zampieri 013 ). In particular, a lower degree of 56 Ni mixing (i.e. models where he Ni is more confined to the central region of the ejecta) is linked to a onger plateau, as observed for SN 2020cxd. We also perform some reliminary hydrodynamical modelling of SN 2021aai in the low eddening scenario. Firstly, we notice that the plateau temperature f 4300 K was too low to be fitted by our models, which makes the igh reddening a more reliable scenario. Fitting only the bolometric ight curve and the expansion velocities, we obtain values of R and reduced by a factor of \u223c1.5\u20132 and a ratio E / M ej almost unchanged ompared to the high reddening scenario.\nSUMMARY A N D C O N C L U S I O N S\ne present optical photometry and spectroscopy for two LL SNe IIP: 020cxd and 2021aai. SN 2020cxd appears to be sub-luminous even ompared to other transients in its class, with an absolute magnitude f M r = \u201314.02 \u00b1 0.21 mag at the start of the plateau, making t one of the faintest LL SNe IIP observed to date. On the other and, SN 2021aai is a transitional object between LL SNe IIP and ore standard SN IIP events, once corrected for the large extinction ffecting the target ( A V = 1.9 mag). Both transients display spectra\nMNRAS 513, 4983\u20134999 (2022)\nM\nt 2 a [ v P o w o r a p t 5\no b f\ni t p t = v c p e i n = t b c c M w t c t\nA\nW m d w U A O o d d o p d p w T 1 a i S\ns P t d I o N l o i o T L f a p U C p t f M f A a u t S 2 M f A u C p M P\nD\nT o\nR\nA A A B B B B\nB C C C\nC C C\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/513/4/4983/6576341 by C onsejo Superior de Investigaciones C ientificas (C SIC ) user on 26 Septem ber 2022 hat perfectly match those of other LL SNe IIP (Pastorello et al. 004 ; Spiro et al. 2014 ), characterized by H lines in the early phases nd followed by the rise of metal lines (mainly Fe II , Sc II , Ba II , Ca II ], and Ca II NIR triplet) during the plateau phase. The expansion elocities obtained by measuring the position of the minimum of the Cygni line profile, well visible for most lines, yields velocities f few 10 3 km s \u22121 , below those of standard SNe IIP, but in line ith what was observed for LL SNe IIP. The temperature trend btained through spectral energy distribution fitting shows a very apid decline during the early phases, dropping to \u223c5500 K at \u223c30 d fter explosion and maintaining this temperature throughout the lateau phase, as expected for H recombination. After fading from he plateau, both objects settle on the linear decline powered by the 6 Ni decay chain. By comparing their late time luminosity with that f SN 1987A at the same phase, we estimate the 56 Ni synthesized to e 1.8 \u00b1 0.5 \u00d7 10 \u22123 M for SN 2020cxd and 1.4 \u00b1 0.5 \u00d7 10 \u22122 M or SN 2021aai (considering the high reddening scenario). We also perform hydrodynamical modelling of our targets usng the procedure described in Pumo et al. ( 2017 ), which uses he general\u2013relativistic, radiation\u2013hydrodynamics, Lagrangian code resented in Pumo & Zampieri ( 2011 ). The physical parameters of he progenitor star of SN 2021aai at the moment of explosion are R 4 \u00d7 10 13 cm ( \u223c 575 R ), M ej = 15.5 M and E = 0.4 foe. These alues are consistent with the explosion of an RSG star after the ollapse of its iron core (Wheeler & Swartz 1993 ). The transitional roperties of SN 2021aai, linking LL SNe IIP and standard SN IIP vents, are e vident when considering its E/ M ej ratio (Fig. 13 ). The nterpretation of the parameters obtained for SN 2020cxd is more uanced. The best fit yields R = 4 \u00d7 10 13 cm ( \u223c 575 R ), M ej 7.5 M and E = 0.097 foe, values which can be compatible with he iron core collapse explosion of a low-mass (8.9\u201310.4 M ) RSG, ut they are also consistent with an explosion triggered by electron aptures involving a massive super\u2013AGB (i.e. with an initial mass lose to the upper limit of the mass range typical of this class of stars, mas ; see Pumo et al. 2009 , and references therein). In conclusion, e analyse two objects spanning the brightest and faintest edges of he LL SNe IIP class, with SN 2021aai bridging the low-luminosity lass with more traditional SNe IIP, and SN 2020cxd being so faint hat it can be reasonably considered a possible ECSN candidate.

Hiramatsu et al. ( 2021 ) found everal indicators fa v ouring the ECSN event for this transient, in articular the chemical composition of the progenitor and the results f the nucleosynthesis, the light curve morphology, and the presence f CSM. We also chose to include in this small sample SN 2008S Botticella et al. 2009 ), taken as a prototype of ILRTs. This class as associated to ECSNe due to their faintness (e.g. Humphreys t al. 2011 ), their progenitors (Prieto 2008 ; Thompson et al. 2009 ), nd the presence of circumstellar material, clearly evident in all heir spectra, which corroborates their origin from a Super-AGB rogenitor. In Fig. A1 , we show the R band (correction between R and r ands were applied as discussed in Section 3.2 ) light curves of the hree transients mentioned. For SN 2018zd we adopt both distances eported in Hiramatsu et al. ( 2021 ) and Callis et al. ( 2021 ). The ncrease in brightness during the plateau of SN 2020cxd is striking, ince it is the only object displaying this behaviour. SN 2018zd shows erhaps a more canonical plateau, slightly declining in brightness v er the course of \u223c 120 d. The late time decline of SN 2008S is lmost coincident with that of SN 2020cxd.\nTo better visualize the relationship between these objects and the ata shown in Section 6 , in Fig. A2 , we plot SN 2008S and SN 018zd on the M V - 56 Ni diagram already shown in Fig. 10 , We ote that a tight relationship between these two quantities was found or SNe IIP, but SN 2008S fits remarkably well in the lower end\nNRAS 513, 4983\u20134999 (2022)\nigure A1.

SN 2018zd appears to belong to the standard IP events when correcting for the distance reported by Callis et al. 2021 ), while it lies towards the region of transitional objects (like N 2021aai) when adopting the distance prescribed by Hiramatsu t al. ( 2021 ).\nIn Fig. A3 , we present a comparison between the spectra of this mall sample of ECSN candidates at early, middle, and late phases top, middle, and bottom panel, respectively). The earliest phase vailable for a spectrum of SN 2008S is at 15 d after the explosion, hile the spectra of SNe 2018zd and 2020cxd were taken within d from the explosion. Ho we ver, we note that the spectra of ILRTs volv e v ery slowly, as the y are dominated by CSM emission: for this eason, the main features characterizing the spectra do not change n short time scales. In the early spectrum of SN 2018zd it is ossible to notice some narrow H lines without P-Cygni profiles, omehow reminiscent of the ILRT spectrum (although with a much luer colour), which can be traced back to the presence of CSM, as iramatsu et al. ( 2021 ) infer from their analysis of the ultraviolet olour evolution. At the same phases, SN 2020cxd already shows -Cygni profiles and broad H lines, in line with the expectations or a LL SN IIP. At \u223c30\u201340 d, SN 2008S shows almost no sign of volution, with the narrow H and Ca lines completely dominating the pectrum. SN 2020cxd, on the other hand, develops an abundance of etal lines (the line-blanketing effect is already evident) and deep -Cygni profiles. In this phase, SN 2018zd transitions towards a ore standard SN IIP, although the metal lines are still much weaker ompared to SN 2020cxd, the line-blanketing effect is not marked, nd some signature features such as the Ca II NIR triplet are still issing. Finally, at late times the spectrum of SN 2008S has kept asically the same narrow lines it has shown throughout its evolution, ven without a continuum underneath them. SN 2018zd displays an rray of prominent emission lines, allowing the detailed analysis erformed by Hiramatsu et al. ( 2021 ), which stated that this object is ompatible with an ECSN event on the basis of the nucleosynthesis\nFigure A3. Comparison between the spectra of SN 2008S, SN 2018zd, and SN 2020cxd. In the top panel are shown the early spectra; in the middle panel are presented the spectra during the plateau phase; and in the bottom panel are shown the late spectra. All spectra were corrected for redshift and reddening.\na t s\n( c\ns h a\nc o\n6\ne p\nt r s w e\nt e 2 e\nA P\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/513/4/4983/6576341 by C onsejo Superior de Investigaciones C ientificas (C SIC ) user on 26 Septem ber 2022 nd chemical composition expectations. 6 Sadly, it was impossible o perform a similar analysis on SN 2020cxd, due to the very poor ignal-to-noise ratio obtained in our latest spectra. In conclusion, applying the criteria presented by Hiramatsu et al. 2021 ) to identify an ECSN event, we notice the following pros and ons: (i) The low energy characterizing SN 2020cxd and its light curve hape are consistent with an ECSN origin. As shown in Section 7.2 , ydrodynamical modelling points towards a progenitor between 8.9 nd 10.4 M , compatible with the expectations for a super-AGB star. (ii) We did not hav e an y direct detection of the progenitor, nor ould we investigate the nucleosynthesis and chemical composition f the progenitor through nebular spectra.\nDespite the presence of prominent emission lines, we note that Hiramatsu t al. ( 2021 ) and Callis et al. ( 2021 ) disagree on the presence of abundance atterns that support the ECSN hypothesis.\n(iii) The lack of CSM that can be inferred from the spectra seems o point towards a low-mass Red Giant Branch (RGB) progenitor, ather than a super-AGB, therefore favouring the iron core-collapse cenario for SN 2020cxd (although a Super-AGB star could explode ithout being surrounded by optically thick CSM in some cases, see .g Pumo et al. 2009 ).\nWe know that low-mass RGB progenitors were accurately idenified in the past, e.g. for SN 2008bk (Van Dyk et al. 2012 ; Maund t al. 2014 ; O\u2019Neill et al. 2021 ) and SN 2018aoq (O\u2019Neill et al. 019 ). A similar scenario could comfortably explain the SN 2020cxd vent.\nPPENDI X B: SUPPLEMENTA RY TA BLES A N D I CTURES\nMNRAS 513, 4983\u20134999 (2022)\nMNRAS 513, 4983\u20134999 (2022)\nTable B1.
