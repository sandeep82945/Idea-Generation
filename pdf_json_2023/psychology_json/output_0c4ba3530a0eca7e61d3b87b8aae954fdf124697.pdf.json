    "abstractText": "In the present work, the chemical synthesis of AgPt nanoalloys is reported by the polyol method using polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as a surfactant and a heterogeneous nucleation approach. Nanoparticles with different atomic compositions of the Ag and Pt elements (1:1 and 1:3) were synthesized by adjusting the molar ratios of the precursors. The physicochemical and microstructural characterization was initially performed using the UV-Vis technique to determine the presence of nanoparticles in suspension. Then, the morphology, size, and atomic structure were determined using XRD, SEM, and HAADF-STEM techniques, confirming the formation of a well-defined crystalline structure and homogeneous nanoalloy with an average particle size of less than 10 nm. Finally, the cyclic voltammetry technique evaluated the electrochemical activity of bimetallic AgPt nanoparticles supported on Vulcan XC-72 carbon for the ethanol oxidation reaction in an alkaline medium. Chronoamperometry and accelerated electrochemical degradation tests were performed to determine their stability and long-term durability. The synthesized AgPt (1:3)/C electrocatalyst presented significative catalytic activity and superior durability due to the introduction of Ag that weakens the chemisorption of the carbonaceous species. Thus, it could be an attractive candidate for cost-effective ethanol oxidation compared to commercial Pt/C.",

            "text": "The use of alcohols as fuels in electrochemical cells has increased over the last decade due to their potential application in self-sustainable energy production with minimal environmental impact [1\u20134]. In addition, liquid fuels are safer and more convenient for storage and transportation than compressed hydrogen. Furthermore, for their high efficiency, fast refueling, and low outgassing, direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFCs) are considered future portable power conversion devices [5\u20139]. Platinum (Pt) is one of the most important noble metals for manufacturing electrocatalysts used in DEFCs [10]. However, its commercialization is limited by its high cost and decreased oxidation potential due to the ethanol crossover effect (ECO), electrocatalyst poisoning by chemisorbed intermediate species during transport, and oxidation of ethanol through the membrane, which results in the obtaining mixed potentials for the ethanol oxidation (EOR) and oxygen reduction (ORR) reactions, with a significant loss of their performance [11\u201314].\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 1396. https://doi.org/10.3390/nano13081396 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2023, 13, 1396 2 of 16\nIn recent years, particular attention has been paid to designing cost-effective electrocatalysts with excellent resistance to carbonaceous intermediate species poisoning without compromising the high catalytic activity of EOR [15,16]. Furthermore, implementing heterogeneous Pt-based nanostructures in nanoalloys form with controlled size and morphology has improved suppression in the adsorption of poisonous species to monometallic Pt [17]. Due to the above, several noble metals (Rh, Pd, Au, Ni, Ru), as oxophilic components with relatively stable and considerable reactivity, have been used to form Pt nanoalloys, facilitating the formation of oxygen species at lower potentials to effectively oxidize intermediate species through the Langmuir\u2013Hinshelwood mechanism and improve electrocatalyst stability [18\u201321]. Moreover, silver (Ag) has been proposed as a functional and beneficial element with high chemical stability. It has an electronic structure and an atomic radius similar to that of Pt, fulfilling the conditions for forming substitutional solid solution rules; furthermore, their implementation in forming bimetallic nanostructures can modify the electronic valence bands, minimizing activation energies and developing new interfaces promoting electronic exchange between elements. The AgPt alloy during the ethanol oxidation reaction can simultaneously promote the oxidation of intermediates through the activation of the surface sites of Pt to reduce its poisoning by CO-like species due to weak surface adsorption originating from introducing Ag atoms to the system [22\u201325]. Therefore, the modification in the stoichiometric composition will affect the local elemental arrangement, affecting the electronic structure of the superficial sites of Pt and modifying its stability and catalytic activity. In addition, control of the size and morphology during the synthesis of the alloy can result in an increase in the surface area of the material and a preferential atomic arrangement, improving, in the same way, its catalytic performance [26]. Based on the considerations described above, this study presents the development of AgPt electrocatalysts using an easy and flexible synthesis method based on the polyol technique to obtain alloyed nanoparticles with a controlled size and morphology. In addition, by varying the molar ratio of the precursors, the relationship between the composition and its catalytic behavior toward the ethanol oxidation reaction was studied. Electrochemical measurements confirmed that AgPt nanoparticles with different molar ratios exhibit an enhanced electrocatalytic performance compared to commercial Pt/C, having the highest performance, with AgPt (1:3)/C showing better catalytic activity and stability."

            "text": "The crystallographic nature of the synthesized bimetallic nanoparticles (BNPs) was characterized using the X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique. Typical XRD patterns of the AgPt alloy BNPs are shown in Figure 1. All XRD patterns showed three broad diffraction peaks that were assigned to (111), (200), and (220) reflections indexed with the face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal structure with an Fm-3m space group. No other diffraction peaks were observed in the second phase. These three peaks were observed at different 2\u03b8 compared to pure Ag (JCPDS 04-0783) and Pt (JCPDS 04-0802) structures. The XRD patterns displayed diffraction peak shifts linear to higher 2\u03b8 as the amount of Pt increased in the AgPt BNPs. This indicated that AgPt (1:3) had a higher composition of Pt than AgPt (1:1). Therefore, the results suggest that the AgPt BNPs are uniformly alloyed. The miscibility of an alloy was determined according to the Hume\u2013Rothery rules [29], which indicate that the alloy is preferred when the crystal structure, atomic radii, valence, and electronegativity of the two elements are similar; therefore, Ag and Pt are capable of forming AgPt alloys. Furthermore, the corresponding phase diagram of the elements confirmed that the Ag-Pt system formed miscible heterogeneous alloys with atomic contents rich in Pt for the concentrations used in this study (1:1 and 1:3) [30]. Likewise, according to theoretical and experimental studies, the miscibility and diffusion improve with a decrease in particle size [31]. However, in some bimetallic nanosystems, it is also necessary to include the surface energy of the elements to determine their miscibility [32]. Vegard\u2019s law can be an indication of miscible binary alloys that form solid solution (Equation (2)) [33]:\na = a2\n( 1 +\na1 \u2212 a2 a2\n\u00d7 x1 )\n(2)\nwhere a is the calculated lattice parameter of AgPt BNPs, a1 and a2 are lattice parameters of two corresponding pure metals, Ag (0.4086 nm) and Pt (0.3923 nm), respectively, and x1 is the atomic fraction of component 1 (0.5 for AgPt (1:1), and 0.25 for AgPt (1:3)). The experimental lattice parameter was calculated from the Rietveld refinement, obtaining 0.3996 nm and 0.3965 nm for AgPt (1:1) and AgPt (1:3), respectively. According to Vegard\u2019s law, the average calculated atomic composition was Ag45Pt55, and Ag26Pt74, these values were corroborated by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis. The average crystallite size was determined based on the broad peak of the (111) plane using Scherrer\u2019s formula (Equation (3)) [34]:\nt = 0.9\u03bb\n\u03b2cos\u03b8 (3)\nwhere t is the crystallite size, 0.9 is a shape factor that is an attribute of the equipment, \u03bb is the X-ray wavelength (0.154 nm), \u03b2 is the full width at half maximum intensity, and \u03b8 is the Bragg angle.

XRD patterns obtained from AgPt bimetallic nanoparticles with different atomic ratios.\nFigure 2a shows the results of the analysis using UV-Vis spectroscopy. Several metal nanoparticles showed the surface plasmon surface (SPR) phenomenon. For Ag, this signal was between 350 and 600 nm, the position of which depended on the size and morphology of the nanoparticles [35,36]. An intense absorption band located at 401 nm was observed in the spectrum corresponding to the Ag seeds. According to some reports, this position indicates the presence of small particles [37,38]. On the other hand, the spectrum corresponding to the AgPt (1:1) bimetallic nanoparticles showed a significant decrease in the signal corresponding to the Ag seeds. This decrease was more evident when the Pt concentration increased, as observed in the spectrum corresponding to the AgPt (1:3) sample. This behavior is because Pt does not show the SPR phenomenon in the UV-Vis spectrum. Therefore, the alteration of the shape and intensity of the band located at 407 nm depended on the combination of Pt with Ag seed leads. Sometimes, the Ag absorption band was shifted, wider, or disappeared completely [39]. Some very weak signals can be distinguished in the spectra shown in the figure. However, it was not possible to determine whether they corresponded to Ag. Therefore, the derivation process was used to corroborate the type of synthesized nanoparticles, specifically the fourth derivative with which absorption bands masked by other signals were distinguished.

STEM is an invaluable tool for the characterization of nanostructures, mainly using the high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) detector, which is associated with the atomic number (Z) of the atoms on the specimen. The contrast in this imaging technique is strongly dependent on the chemical composition (Z-contrast). Therefore, HAADF-STEM allows easy identification of the elements present in the sample, elemental composition, and crystal information at an atomic scale. However, in this particular case, it was difficult to distinguish Ag and Pt as individual atomic columns by Z-contrast in the image because the atoms were randomly distributed, forming an alloy in contrast with the ordered alloys, where it was possible to distinguish individual atomic columns by Z-contrast in the images [42]. Figure 3a shows an HAADF-STEM image of the AgPt (1:3) BNP.

Meanwhile, the corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) reflects the fcc structure along the [101] zone axis (Figure 3b). It is clear that a well-defined truncated octahedron shape, enclosed by the {111} and {100} facets, appeared in the HAADF-STEM image.

For the Ag/C electrocatalyst, Hads/Hdes peaks were not observed due to its electron configuration. This element had a weak hydrogen chemisorption ability, the same as Au and Cu (group 11 of the periodic table). However, when the forward potential scan reached 0.15 V vs. NHE, the first stage of formation of silver oxides started [48\u201350]. Two oxidation regions (Ox1 and Ox2) were observed.

According to the present literature, Ag2O (or AgOH) monolayers originate first and then, through nucleation and a 3D growth mechanism, Ag2O multilayers. The Ox2 region was due to the subsequent oxidation of Ag2O to AgO and the direct oxidation of Ag to Ag (II) oxide through a two-electron process, which co-occurred simultaneously in the same potential range between 0.70 V vs. NHE and 0.85 V vs. NHE.

The spectra showed the presence of Ag, Pt, and C from the samples, Cu and Al from the holder samples, and low detection of the Cl element from the remainder of the precursor salts used. From the EDX analysis, elementary information and atomic (at%) and weight (wt%) percentages were easily obtained. In addition, the analysis revealed that the AgPt BNPs maintained the elemental ratio of (1:1) and (1:3).

All oxidation/reduction processes of pure Pt and Ag were present in the bimetallic electrocatalysts. In essence, these electrochemical reactions occurred at or near the catalyst surface, suggesting that both metals are electrochemically accessible regardless of the elemental composition. They were dispersed on the surface of the BNPs, supporting the presence of an alloy structure. In addition, from Figure 5a, a negative shift in the Pt oxide reduction peak may be observed on both AgPt surfaces; consequently, the bimetallic surface transforms more oxygen species because they require less energy than pure Pt/C. As a complement to the analysis, Figure 5b displays an increase in the current density of the Pt oxide reduction peak. The hydrogen underpotential deposition (HUPD) region did not change as the reverse potential limit increased. This behavior supports the synergy between the Ag and Pt elements. Thus, the generation and reduction of more Pt oxides were favored when the oxidation of Ag was achieved.\nThe electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) was determined using CV curves similar to a powerful surface-sensitive technique. For pure Pt and AgPt bimetallic surface, the ECSA was determined on the charge associated with the Pt-HUPD region, which is based on the adsorption/desorption of H atoms. Meanwhile, for pure Ag, the ECSA was determined by the coulomb charge of the redox reaction of the surface metal. This is the interaction between the surface atoms and oxygenated species, so the reduction peak of one monolayer of metal oxides was integrated. The resulting ECSA values are shown in Table 1. AgPt (1:3)/C presented an ECSA of 19.43 m2 g\u22121, which was higher than AgPt (1:1)/C (15.50 m2 g\u22121).

The Ag surface failed to interact actively with ethanol molecules. Since it was catalytically inactive for ethanol oxidation, the current density was normalized by the Pt charge to obtain the mass activity (MA), which mainly reflects the cost efficiency between similar electrocatalysts, considering that all atoms of the particle were active sites. Figure 6a displays the catalytic behavior toward the EOR of AgPt (1:1)/C and AgPt (1:3)/C electrocatalysts, along with commercial Pt/C as a reference. The current density of the forward peak indicates the maximum reaction rate; thus, it was a principal parameter for insight into catalytic properties. The AgPt (1:3)/C presented an enhanced MA of 0.62 A mg\u22121 and for AgPt (1:1)/C of 0.29 A mg\u22121, while the commercial Pt/C was 0.16 A mg\u22121. This result indicates an MA for AgPt (1:3)/C of 3.9-fold higher than the commercial Pt/C results. This confirms that alloying with a lower-cost metal in an adequate composition is an effective approach to achieve superior mass activity and thus cost-effective bimetallic electrocatalysts, using an engineering perspective to develop electrochemical devices. However, to evaluate the intrinsic electrochemical performance of the catalyst surface, the specific activity (SA) was obtained, and the corresponding CV curves are shown in Figure 6b. The AgPt (1:3)/C presented an enhanced SA of 3.19 mA cm\u22122 and for AgPt (1:1)/C of 1.86 mA cm\u22122, while the commercial Pt/C was 1.15 mA cm\u22122. This result indicates a SA for AgPt (1:3)/C of 2.8-fold higher than commercial Pt/C. The MA and SA are also present in Figure 6c for better visualization and are reported in Table 1. Likewise, we noticed new properties, such as the AgPt (1:3)/C electrocatalyst presenting an onset potential with more negative values than the rest of the materials. The dashed line in Figure 6d indicates that AgPt (1:3)/C reaches a SA of 0.1 mA cm\u22122, 160 mV earlier than the commercial Pt/C, indicating a lower energy barrier of the reaction, so the EOR was more facile on the AgPt (1:3)/C surface. A review of the literature supports the advancement of AgPt (1:3)/C compared to other transition metals as a co-catalyst element toward the EOR. For example, the forward peak current density of the octahedral Pt2.3Ni/C with an average size of 10 nm displayed an SA of 1.46 mA cm\u22122, and the authors explained that the improved catalytic performance implies the octahedral shape and alloying effect [52]. In other work, PtAg porous nanotubes with delicate 3D porous wall structures showed a specific current density of 1.97 mA cm\u22122 [45]. The previous materials showed lower performance than the AgPt (1:3)/C prepared in this work. With a similar current density, the ethanol oxidation performance of the ultrathin PtRu NWs/C was 3.78 mA cm\u22122 [53]. Additionally, the working group evaluated the PdPt/C electrocatalyst, showing an SA of 3.27 mA cm\u22122 [54]; however, Ru and Pd are expensive noble metals. Therefore, the AgPt (1:3)/C electrocatalyst has competitive performance toward the OER with the advantage of being a cost-effective material.

To verify the tolerance to poisonous species, following the CA test, with enough time to observe a stable state in the electrocatalytic response, a couple of voltammetry cycles were performed in a fresh alkaline solution for the same potential window and from a lower potential limit toward the anodic direction are displayed in Figure S3. It is assumed that the visualization of additional peaks or regions is due to the presence of active species that remained adsorbed on the electrode throughout the stability test. In this case, the effect of carbonaceous intermediates may be reflected in surface poisoning and correlated with the resulting stability test. Thus, the superior stability of AgPt (1:3)/C can be seen in Figure 7b, where a close-up of the anodic scan of the CV curves of Figure S3 is displayed to analyze the oxidative desorption of carbonous species on the different electrocatalysts. The main peak potential on AgPt (1:3)/C and AgPt (1:1)/C at \u22120.21 V vs. NHE was more negative than the value for Pt/C (\u22120.16 V vs. NHE); this indicates that the removal of COlike species is more facile on the bimetallic surface, which is caused by the weaker CO adsorption strength due to the possible change in the electronic structure by the incorporation of Ag atoms into the Pt structure. However, the cover layer was higher on AgPt (1:1)/C. Therefore, the highest residual EOR activity on AgPt (1:3)/C may have arisen from the lower accumulation of intermediate carbonaceous species, such as CO, due to its higher ECSA and more effective oxidation step for such species. In addition, a prominent and broad CO-like oxidation region on Pt/C might correspond to the two types of COads species due to its binding energy, which is stronger than AgPt/C samples.

Through the UV-Vis technique, the changes in the optoelectronic properties of the nanoalloys produced by the incorporation of Ag and Pt atoms into the Ag growth seeds were determined. The extinction of the SPR band characteristic of Ag seeds was defined with the increase in the atomic percentage of Pt, confirming the formation of AgPt nanoalloys.

SE and AADF-STE deter ined the particle size, morphology, and distribution of the nanoalloys, obtaining an average particle size of 6 and 10 nm for the ratios 1:1 and 1:3, respectively. The nanoparticles in both systems presented a good distribution along the support material (Vulcan XC-72 carbon). On the other hand, the particles exhibited a truncated octahedral morphology with exposed {100} and {111} surface planes related to highly stable surface energy densities and selectivity for specific catalytic reactions. The synergistic interaction between Ag and Pt was studied as an electrocatalyst for ethanol oxidation, verifying that the ratio between Pt and Ag significantly affected the electrocatalytic performance, although pure Ag has no activity toward the EOR. AgPt (1:3)/C presented a new catalytic surface exhibiting a MA/SA 3.9/2.8 times higher than the commercial Pt/C, as well as superior CO-like tolerance and the best stability. Alloying Pt with Ag is an attractive strategy for designing cost-effective electrocatalysts. Therefore, AgPt (1:3)/C has the competitive potential of being used as an electrode material for fuel cell applications.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/nano13081396/s1, Figure S1.
