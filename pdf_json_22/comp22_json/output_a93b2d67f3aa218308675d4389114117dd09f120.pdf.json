    "abstractText": "The emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been bringing the world to a standstill. Beyond all doubt, the most striking therapeutic target for antibody development is the spike (S) protein on the surface of virus. In contrast with an immunodominant receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein, little is known about neutralizing antibodies binding mechanisms of N-terminal domain (NTD), let alone the effect of NTD mutation on antibody binding and risk of immune evasion. Employing various computational approaches in this study, we investigated critical residues for NTD-antibody bindings and their detailed mechanism. The results showed that some residues on NTD including Y144, K147, R246 and Y248 are critically involved in the direct interaction of NTD with many monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), indicating that the viruses harboring these residue mutations may have high risk of immune evasion. Binding free energy calculations and the interaction mechanism study revealed that R246I, which is present in Beta (B.1.351) variant, may decrease or even abrogate the efficacies of many antibodies. Therefore, special attention should be paid to the mutations of the 4 residues for future antibody design and development.",

Beyond all doubt, the most striking therapeutic target for antibody development is the spike (S) protein on the surface of virus. In contrast with an immunodominant receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein, little is known about neutralizing antibodies binding mechanisms of N-terminal domain (NTD), let alone the effect of NTD mutation on antibody binding and risk of immune evasion. Employing various computational approaches in this study, we investigated critical residues for NTD-antibody bindings and their detailed mechanism. The results showed that some residues on NTD including Y144, K147, R246 and Y248 are critically involved in the direct interaction of NTD with many monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), indicating that the viruses harboring these residue mutations may have high risk of immune evasion. Binding free energy calculations and the interaction mechanism study revealed that R246I, which is present in Beta (B.1.351) variant, may decrease or even abrogate the efficacies of many antibodies. Therefore, special attention should be paid to the mutations of the 4 residues for future antibody design and development.\nKey Words: COVID-19; spike protein; R246I; NTD antibody; MM/GBSA"

            "text": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a serious threat to public health with severe socio-economic damage. As of August 2021, there are more than 213 million confirmed cases and about 4.44 million deaths worldwide1.\nThe pathogenic agent, namely SARS-CoV-2, is a kind of positive-sense RNA virus,\nconsisting of spike (S) glycoprotein, membrane protein, envelope glycoprotein, lipid bilayer and inner structures2. It belongs to the betacoronavirus genus whose family members include Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Similar to the two family members, SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells through S protein which can interact with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) entry receptor on host membranes with high affinity3-4. As a consequence, the S protein becomes the main target of neutralizing antibodies. S1 and S2 subunits are two functional components of the S protein, of which the former (S1) is further divided into receptor-binding domain (RBD) necessary for ACE2 binding, N-terminal domain (NTD) and other domains5-6. So far, plenty of mAbs recognizing RBD have been discovered such as REGN109337, S2M118. Compared with RBD-specific mAbs, a small number of antibodies targeted to NTD have been developed. Nevertheless, it is reported that some NTD-targeting mAbs are capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro with high potency 9-10. For instance, McCallum et al. described 41 NTD-specific human mAbs, among which S2X333 neutralized SARS-CoV-2 with an IC50 of 2 ng/mL, on par with the first-rate RBD mAbs S2E12 and S2M1111. Therefore, NTD may be another promising therapeutic target site.\nAlthough prophylactic and/or therapeutic drugs are being developed at an\nunprecedented pace, it is still unknown when the epidemic will be under effective control all over the world. One of the most crucial reasons is that a larger number of prevalent mutations and deletions in S glycoprotein have emerged since the start of the outbreak and this rapid viral evolution could either facilitate transmissibility, or lead to reduction in protective efficacy of vaccines and mAbs 12-14. Typically, SARS-CoV-2\nBeta (B.1.351/501Y.V2) variant, emerging in late 2020 in Eastern Cape, South Africa (SA), contains 9 S protein mutations including three mutations (K417N, E484K, N501Y) in RBD, a cluster of NTD mutations (e.g., 242-244del & R246I) and so on15. Wang et al. found that this variant is refractory to neutralization by convalescent plasma and vaccine sera16. McCarthy et al. found that 90% of deletion mutations occupied four discrete sites within the NTD12. What is worth mentioning is that SARS-CoV-2 Lambda (B.1.621) variant , a new variant of interest with higher infectivity and immune resistance, has T76I, L452Q, F490S and a unique 7-amino-acid insertion mutation (RSYLTPGD246-253N) in the N-terminal domain17. All of above have made the current drug development situation even grimmer. Hence, it matters laying emphasis on immunogenicity of different S protein domains and the specific mechanism of mAbs targeting them, including NTD.\nUp to now, there have already been numerous studies to learn the effects and\nmechanism of mutations in the RBD domain18-20. In particular, RBD mutations containing E484K, N501Y and K417N have attracted considerable attention from researchers21-23. Whereas, the details of the NTD mutations have been still elusive until now, owing to the absence of attaching great importance to this antigenic site. When it comes to researches about NTD, recent reports elucidated that several currently circulating variants, comprising Beta (B.1.351) and Alpha (B.1.1.7), harbors some NTD mutations like Y144del, R246I, etc., and these lineages will partially or completely escape neutralization mediated by a variety of mAbs16. The biochemistry experiments by McCallum and Wang et al. both give evidence of some NTD single-point mutations including R246I, R246A, K147T impairing immune therapies11, 16. Kimura et al. revealed that the RSYLTPGD246-253N insertion mutation in the N-terminal domain of the Lambda S protein, is responsible for evasion from neutralizing antibodies17. By comparison, even though A222V possesses a high mutation rate according to statistic by GISAID sequence database24, it makes no difference to immunogenicity11. Considering this, it is of great significance to understand binding modes of NTD antibody-antigen and distinguish detrimental mutations effectively from so much data.\nComplementary to time-consuming wet lab study, computational methods are\ncapable of providing a lot of details about protein-protein interaction binding pattern more than binding affinity. To our knowledge, no one has systematically studied the details of antibody-antigen binding and mutant effects for NTD yet using computing methods. Herein, we pay attention to in silico approaches to explore the crucial residues for NTD-antibody binding and predict mutational implications for neutralizing effectiveness. Methodically analyzing binding patterns by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and end-point molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA)25 binding free energy calculation helps to shed light on the binding mechanisms of NTD-antibody. Our results revealed that mutations of some residues on NTD including Y144, K147, R246, Y248 have the high hazard of immune evasion for many antibodies and R246I mutation may reduce the efficacies of most current NTD antibodies through abolishing the hydrogen bond and electrostatic interaction with antibodies. Our research findings could be beneficial for drug design and mAbs-based therapeutics in clinical."

These residues constitute\nantibodies\u2019 epitopes, which concentrate in N terminus (residue 14-19), a \u03b2 -sheet\nspanning residue 144-158 and a loop formed by residue 246-256, collectively forming an antigenic site on the pinnacle of the NTD (Figure 1, red surface).\nBinding interfaces of all 11 antibodies are highly overlapping and flanked by four\noligosaccharides at position N17, N74, N122 and N149, which may exert an impact on\nantibodies\u2019 binding.\nKey residues in NTD for neutralizing mAbs binding We performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulation for 11 prototype glycosylated NTD-antibody systems, and the frames extracted from 30-60ns trajectories were applied to subsequent analysis. The key binding residues were identified from analysis of the MM/GBSA binding free energy decomposition results, and the residues with energy contribution < -1.00 kcal/mol were chosen as pivotal residues.\nIn total, there are 38 key residues in S protein NTD for all 11 systems (Figure 2A).\nThe greater the energy contribution of the residues means that its mutations are more likely to affect the effectiveness of antibodies. As indicated in Figure 2A, R246 takes the most vital part in five systems viz. 5-24 (PDB ID: 7L2F), 4A8 (PDB ID: 7C2L), FC05 (PDB ID: 7CWS), 2-51 (PDB ID: 7L2C), 1-87 (PDB ID: 7L2D) (Figure 2A, Table S2). In the five systems, the energy contribution of R246 is over 9.90 kcal/mol (Table S2). Therefore, the mutations of R246 have the highest risk of immune escape. In addition, mutants of K147 may also affect the potencies of some antibodies. Research\nresults by McCallum et.al already showed that K147T mutant weakens the potencies of 4A8 (PDB ID: 7C2L), S2X333 (PDB ID: 7LXY) and S2M28 (PDB ID: 7LY2), but has little implication in S2L28 (PDB ID: 7LXZ)11, which is in accordance with our prediction about K147 (Figure 2A).\nWhen it comes to occupancy frequencies of key residues among 11 systems, there\nare 14 residues that have direct interaction with 3 or more antibodies, and 9 residues, concentrating in residues 144-147 and 246-252, that play an important role in 5 or more systems (Figure 2B). In particular, Y144 is involved in almost all mAbs binding except DH1052 (PDB ID: 7LAB), and the mutants of Y144 like Y144del and Y144F are already present in the real world26. Y144, K147, R246 and Y248 make a relatively large contribution in 8 or more antibodies binding, hinting mutations of these four residues have the high possibility to affect binding affinities of most NTD mAbs. Thus, we should pay special attention to these sites when optimizing antibodies to NTD.\nIn consideration of both binding free energy contribution and occupancy frequency,\nR246 on S protein has the strongest binding affinity to the antibodies among the first four residues with the high frequency, arousing our interest to do further investigation.\nfrequencies of key residues in all 11 systems.\nImpact of R246I mutation on S protein for NTD-specific antibodies binding In light of the research of Wibmer et al., R246I has already appeared in SARS-CoV-2 Beta (B.1.351) variant13. To evaluate the binding affinity between various antibodies and R246I mutant NTD, MM/GBSA calculations were carried out with wild type NTD as control based on 2 independent MD runs lasting 60ns.\nThe results of binding free energy (\u0394G) with glycans\u2019 contribution are hard to\nreproduce in each experiment (Table S3). In order to exploring more details, 500ns MD simulation was executed for 7L2F complex. As indicated in Figure S1, the three flexible sugars (N17, N74, N122 glycan), especially N17 glycan, move intensely and stay closed to the antibody within 3 angstroms most of the time for wild type complex (Figure S1A), while for R246I complex, the sugars are more than 5 angstroms away from the antibody in most of the time (Figure S1B). What\u2019s more, the energy contribution of glycans varies between -2.75 and -26.82 kcal/mol in the wild type complex, but only between -9.02 and 2.76 kcal/mol in the R246I mutant (Figure S1C). In conclusion, the flexibility of glycans allows their binding free energy contribution to vary greatly over time and have a big gap between the two systems. Whereas, provided that single point mutations don\u2019t cause large conformational changes, the contribution of sugars in the wild type and mutant should be similar. It's hard to sample statistically significant conformations of complexes with sugars at different positions over a limited period of simulation time. In this article we focus on the effect of residue mutations on antibody binding, rather than the role of sugars. Thus, when calculating binding affinities between NTD and antibodies, we excluded the contribution of sugars.\nAs shown in Figure 3 (Table S4 for details), \u0394G of wild type NTD is higher than\nthat of R246I mutant in 8 systems except for 4-18 (PDB ID: 7L2E), DH1052 (PDB ID: 7LAB), S2X333 (PDB ID: 7LXY), suggesting that R246I mutant has the potential to impact the effectiveness of these 8 antibodies. As was expected, the energy contribution changes of R246 and I246 to the overall binding energy show the same tendency as \u0394G (Figure 4). Moreover, we performed 500ns MD simulation for 7L2F complex, whose\ntrends of \u0394\u0394G in different length of simulation time are consistent with the result of 30- 60ns (Table S5). This demonstrated that 60ns simulation is enough to obtain the variation tendency. Recent studies show that R246I can weaken the affinity of some antibodies, to varying degrees, including 5-24 (PDB ID:7L2F), 4A8 (PDB ID: 7C2L), 2-17 (PDB ID: 7LQW), FC05 (PDB ID: 7CWS)16, 27, and our predictions of percentage change in the relative binding free energy for above four systems are -53.76%, -40.58%, -13.92%, -19.13% respectively (Figure 3, Table S4). Therefore, our predicted trends of the relative binding free energy percentage are in good agreement with existing experimental findings, proving that our method is reliable to a certain extent.\nAccording to our prediction, the percentage of relative binding free energy\nbetween wild type NTD and R246I mutant to antibodies are -28.85%, -16.95%, -13.87% and -13.72% for 1-87 (PDB ID:7L2D), 2-51 (PDB ID: 7L2C), S2M28 (PDB ID: 7LY2) and S2L28 (PDB ID:7LXZ) respectively, implying R246I mutation is possible to impair the efficacies of these four antibodies (Figure 3, Table S4). One of the most noteworthy things is that the affinity decreases the most for antibody 1-87 (PDB ID: 7L2D). These results suggest that it is best to avoid using these four types of antibodies alone, especially 1-87, against variants with R246I mutations. Moreover, the \u0394\u0394G for 4-18 (PDB ID:7L2E), DH1052 (PDB ID:7LAB) and S2X333 (PDB ID:7LXY) are around 0 kcal/mol (Table S4), which is indicative of negligible impact on binding affinity (P value > 0.01). These three antibodies may not be susceptible to R246I mutation, so when targeting a mutant strain of SARS-COV-2 that has R246I mutation, they may work even better. Our findings can provide guidance on the clinical use of NTD antibodies.\nMolecular mechanism for 5-24 binding to R246I mutant NTD\nIn order to understand the underlying mechanism of R246I mutation, we carried out a more detailed analysis for the trajectory of glycosylated NTD-(5-24) complex (PDB ID: 7L2F). Through energy decomposition of per residue, we found that R246 has a large negative value (-9.95\u00b11.28 kcal/mol), while I246 has an energy contribution close to zero (-0.15\u00b10.07 kcal/mol), which illustrates I246 has much less contact with 5-24 compared with R246 (Figure 5A). What\u2019s more, the contribution of residue D105 in 5- 24 tends to be reversed before and after the mutation (Figure 5A), suggesting that R246 are in close contact with D105.\nBased on above results, we analyzed hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interaction\nbetween D105 in 5-24 and R246 or I246 in NTD in the 500ns MD production phase. Statistically, R246 has various amounts of stable hydrogen bonds with D105, which stabilizes at 2 hydrogen bonds and goes up to 3 sometimes (Figure 5B). However, I246 has no such interaction with antibody during all the simulation time (data not shown). As expected, the positively charged R246 forms a strong electrostatic interaction with D105, while R246I mutation with a neutral charge abolishes that interaction (Figure 5C). To further demonstrate the stability of the electrostatic interaction, we analyzed the distance between R246 and D105 during the whole simulation process. The distance between R246 and D105 is less than 3.75 \u00c5 during 92% of the simulation time, while I246 is more than 6.00 angstroms away from D105 all the time (Figure 5D), corroborating the idea that this interaction between R246 and D105 is very stable and intense.\nIt should be noticed that the phenomenon of hydrogen bonds and electrostatic\ninteraction formed between R246 and antibody observed in the 7L2F is not unique. We noted that R246 in NTD is in close contact with glutamic acid in several antibodies, viz"

This paper applied a series of in silico methods to explore the binding patterns of different antibodies to S protein NTD. By per residue energy decomposition, some residues, including R246,\nY144, K147 and Y248, are found to play a crucial role in multiple NTD-specific antibodies binding. This result reminds us that mutations of these residues has the potential to cause immune evasion. By the means of MD simulation and MM/GBSA calculation, we predicted that R246I mutation may decrease or even invalidate the effectiveness of some mAbs. Further analysis of the molecular mechanism revealed that the immune escape of R246I mutation from 5-24 could be, to a great degree, attributed to the abolishment of the strong hydrogen bonds and electrostatic attractions between R246 of NTD and D105 of antibody. The findings in this study makes it possible to optimize existing therapeutic antibodies, thus making them more efficacious against COVID-19."
