 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Examine the effects of co-exposure to multiple air pollutants and heavy metals during pregnancy on ASD and epilepsy risk. The paper looked at pollutants individually, but co-exposures may have synergistic effects. 

2. Conduct animal studies to elucidate the biological mechanisms linking prenatal air pollution exposure to adverse neurological outcomes. This could shed light on how pollutants impact neurodevelopment.

3. Assess the roles of genetic susceptibility and gene-environment interactions in determining effects of prenatal air pollution on ASD/epilepsy. There may be genetic factors that confer vulnerability. 

4. Expand research to other neurodevelopmental disorders like ADHD, learning disabilities, etc. Air pollution could impact brain development more broadly.

5. Evaluate the efficacy of interventions to reduce prenatal air pollution exposure (e.g. air filters, policy changes) for preventing neurodevelopmental disorders. This could identify potential public health strategies.
