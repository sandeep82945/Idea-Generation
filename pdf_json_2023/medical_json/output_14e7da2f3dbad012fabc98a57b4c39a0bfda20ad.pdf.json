    "abstractText": "Hours after watering plants with 75 mM NaCl, the water potential of reproductive structures precipitously decreases. In flowers with mature gametes, this change in water potential did not alter the rate of fertilization but caused 37% of the fertilized ovules to abort. We hypothesize that the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in ovules is an early physiological manifestation associated with seed failure. In this study, we characterize ROS scavengers that were differentially expressed in stressed ovules to determine whether any of these genes regulate ROS accumulation and/or associate with seed failure. Mutants in an iron-dependent superoxide dismutase (FSD2), ascorbate peroxidase (APX4), and three peroxidases (PER17, PER28, and PER29) were evaluated for changes in fertility. Fertility was unchanged in apx4 mutants, but the other mutants grown under normal conditions averaged a 140% increase in seed failure. In pistils, PER17 expression increases three-fold after stress, while the other genes decreased two-fold or more following stress; this change in expression accounts for differences in fertility between healthy and stressed conditions for different genotypes. In pistils, H2O2 levels rose in per mutants, but only in the triple mutant was there a significant increase, indicating that other ROS or their scavengers be involved in seed failure.",

            "text": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as superoxide (O2\u2212), hydroxyl radicals (\u2022OH), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), are a group of highly active small molecules that can be naturally produced during cellular metabolism. In plants, ROS are mainly produced in chloroplasts, mitochondria, and peroxisomes during photosynthesis, respiration, or other metabolic processes [1,2]. Low to moderate amounts of ROS signal different responses and regulate many biological processes, e.g., development and defense responses [3,4]. Excessive ROS, however, change the redox homeostasis and leads to oxidative stress [5\u20137]. A classic example of redox signaling is the activation of lumen enzymes after illumination. Recently, mutants affecting thioredoxin and glutathione reduction changed auxin transport, which interfered with floral initiation, showed vasculature defects, and altered root morphology [8]. Furthermore, the specific isoforms that interact to form an active auxin receptor show differential responses to osmotic and salt stress and can lead to different ROS levels [9]. Among various ROS in plants, H2O2 is generally considered to be the main molecule that serves as a long-range signaling molecule because it is relatively stable and can diffuse relatively rapidly crossing membranes. ROS can damage proteins, break down fatty acids, damage DNA, and induce programmed cell death (PCD) [6,10,11]. Understanding how plants regulate ROS levels can permit hypotheses of mechanisms to prevent excessive ROS production. In plant cells, there are several ROS-scavenging enzymes to maintain redox homeostasis. Superoxide dismutases (SOD) convert superoxide to H2O2 and oxygen [12]. Catalases\nPlants 2023, 12, 2182. https://doi.org/10.3390/plants12112182 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/plants\nPlants 2023, 12, 2182 2 of 14\n(CAT) break down H2O2 into water and oxygen [13]. Glutathione peroxidases (GPX) reduce H2O2 by oxidizing glutathione (GSH), and glutathione reductases (GR) regenerate GSH utilizing NAD(P)H [14]. Ascorbate peroxidases (APX), which are members of class I peroxidases, reduce H2O2 by oxidizing ascorbate [15]. Each of these ROS scavengers is found in different cell compartments and locations [1,5,16]. The class III heme-containing peroxidases (PER or PRX) are unique to plants and make up a large gene family. In Arabidopsis, there are 73 of these annotated peroxidases [17,18]. Many of these peroxidases are predicted to localize to the cell wall or vacuole and affect lignification, defense responses, hormone metabolism, salt tolerance, and development [19,20]. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) is the best-known class III peroxidase. The radical products generated after this catalytic process trigger pathogen defense responses [21]. The functions of most of these class III peroxidases, however, remain unknown. ROS are recognized as key modulators of PCD [22,23]. Many environmental stresses, such as heat shock, chilling, salt, high light, and pathogen attack, cause ROS accumulation [7,13,24\u201327]. ROS accumulation was observed in salt-stressed ovules and was hypothesized to cause high abortion rates in Arabidopsis [26,28]; fertility is reduced because seeds arise from ovules. Research into stress effects on plant reproduction usually attributes decreases in seed set to pollen defects or pollen tube growth, but few studies evaluated the effects of stress on ovules or embryos. In natural populations, pollen limitation reduces fertility for 60% of plant species. Pollen becomes limiting when plant stress induces pollen abortion or the development of low-quality pollen where the pollen tube fails to transmit the sperm nuclei to the ovule. Pollen is particularly sensitive to stress, especially in monocots. In this work, plants were stressed after male and female gametophyte development was complete, and the effect on subsequent reproduction was evaluated. Pollination and fertilization rates were examined to determine the effect that the male gametophyte had on fertility. Previous work showed that the expression of a group of ROS-scavenging genes was significantly altered in Arabidopsis ovules following salt stress [28]. Here we analyze ROSscavenging mutants that were differentially expressed in stressed ovules at a critical stage of ovule development. We hypothesize that these ROS-scavenging genes may regulate the ROS levels during ovule abortion. In this study, we characterized the role of three PER genes in regulating ROS levels in Arabidopsis ovules, and we tested whether mutants of these loci affect ROS accumulation in ovules or seed failure."

            "text": "After male and female gametophyte development was complete, plants were stressed to determine the downstream effects on reproduction. Since flowers and gametophytes develop synchronously, the gametophyte stage can be inferred from the floral phenotype [29]. Flowering plants were watered once with 75 mM NaCl, the solution was absorbed until the soil reached 100% soil moisture content, and the excess salt solution was discarded. To determine how this osmotic stress affected flowers, inflorescence water potential was measured. Within 6 h, the water potential in flowers dropped significantly and fell to maximal levels within 3 days (Figure 1). Plants were watered every other day, so the water potential data oscillated as the soil dried and rehydrated (Figure 1). These measurements showed that watering with salt increases the number of solutes in the soil and lowers inflorescence water potential for days. Water potential could drop as a result of increased ion transport and accumulation in flowers or a drop in cell turgor in this region. Previous analyses showed that salt stress caused sodium ions to increase by 25% in flowers, but this increase was offset by a decrease in potassium ions [26], resulting in little change in flower osmotic potential. In flowers, salt stress primarily affected water potential and cell turgor.\nPlants 2023, 12, 2182 3 of 14\nPlants 2023, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 14\nlittle change in flower osmotic potential. In flowers, salt stress primarily affected water potential and cell turgor.\nFigure 1. Using a pressure chamber, the water potential of inflorescences was measured periodically after plants were watered once with 75 mM NaCl. The initial point shows the water potential in healthy plants. Following stress, water potential decreases and plateaus after a day. Plants were watered on day 2, 4, and 6, so a slight rise in water potential was observed on those days. Five or more inflorescences were measured at each time point. The best-fit line through the average at each time is plotted. Average \u00b11 standard deviation shown.\n2.2. Increased Ovule Abortion Rate in Peroxidase Mutants Fitness was evaluated in five ROS-scavenging genes (per17, 28, 29, apx4, and fsd2). RT-PCR showed that no full-length transcripts were present in the RNA population of leaves and flowers (Figure 2). Previous work identified these genes as differential during ovule abortion [28]. Since the mutation lesion in each of these mutant lines occurs within or upstream of the peroxidase or SOD domain, these are all loss-of-function mutants (Figure 2). Previous research showed that stage 12 flowers are especially susceptible to environmental stress [26]. Therefore, stage 12 flowers were marked, and the fertility was measured after plants were either salt-stressed treated with 75 mM NaCl for 48 h or under healthy growth conditions. Under normal growth conditions, three class III peroxidase mutants (per17, per28, per29) and a superoxide dismutase mutant (fsd2) caused significant increases in the ovule abortion rates (Table 1 ). The apx4 mutant did not significantly affect fertility. Except for fsd2, the stress treatment significantly altered the fertility of all genotypes. There was a highly significant interaction between the treatment and genotype when comparing the fertility of fsd2 with wild-type plants so, according to Seltman [30], the p values for the main effects (genotype and treatment) are ignored and assumed to be statistically significant. The double and triple mutants of PER genes were created, and the ovule abortion rates of these mutants also rose significantly. Ovule abortion rates were also scored for Arabidopsis under 75 mM NaCl salt stress for 48 h. The ovule abortion rates increased significantly in per17 mutant, per17per28 and per17per29 double mutants, and per17per28per29 triple mutants (Table 1).\n(a) (b)\nFigure 1.

In order to compare the fertility and abortion rates in different experimental replicates, the fertility of each mutant was normalized with wild-type controls that were grown in the same trays as the experimental plants. For the wild-type controls, 95% of the ovules successfully set seed under healthy growth conditions; for the salt-stressed controls, 55% of the ovules set seed. When compared to reproduction rates in the respective single mutants, relative fertility decreased even more in salt-stressed per17, per17per28 and per17per29 double mutants, and the per17per28per29 triple mutant (Table 1). Notably, the ovule abortion rates of these mutants significantly varied from those of wild-type fruits following salt stress (Table 1), indicating that their mutants responded more sensitively to salt stress. These results concur with the differential expression data reported by Sun et al.

            "text": "The genes in this study were chosen for analysis because they exhibited significant changes in expression at the initiation of ovule abortion. These ROS-scavenging genes were PER17, PER28, PER29, APX4, and FSD2. While PER17 expression increased, the levels for the other four genes were significantly lower following salt stress [26]. Previous investigation correlated ROS accumulation in ovules with the rate of ovule abortion [33]. Results show that mature gametophytes or developing ovules tolerate up to 8 h of 75 mM salt stress with minimal disruption to reproduction, but treatment with 200 mM NaCl for 12 h causes more than 90% of the ovules to abort [26]. From a global microarray study [28], five ROS scavengers that exhibited significant changes in gene expression at the critical developmental stage were selected for further analysis. Wide-scale mutational analysis revealed that organisms contain a small fraction of essential genes, but most genes were genetically redundant or exhibited distributed robustness [34,35]. Recent analysis indicates that the vast majority of genes serve a function, but these include chromatin effects, RNA interference, DNA modification, and components altering the genetic landscape (Encode Consortium, 2012). Partial redundancy and distributed robustness both lead to incremental phenotypes instead of lethality. While APX4 transcripts are abundant in leaves and developing embryos [32], mutation of the APX4 locus had no effect on ovule development or plant fertility (Table 1). The absence of an ovule or seed phenotype in apx4 mutants may be due to genetic redundancy with another ROS scavenger. ROS scavengers that are expressed in developing seeds can limit oxidative stress during seed desiccation and germination, thereby reducing seed deterioration [36]. Mutation of the APX4 locus primarily affects seedling growth and establishment [37]."

When water stress slowly increases, plants activate different regulatory networks, permitting acclimation and tolerance to water stress [38]. Once plants in this study were stressed, the rapid change in floral water potential allowed little time for this type of acclimation. Weeks after the imposition of stress, we observed a higher fraction of ovules formed seeds. This observation indicates plants acclimated to these soil conditions. Myouga et al. [39] reported that FSD2 is active in chloroplasts. When plants were grown at five-fold higher fluence rates than those described here, fsd2 leaves were chlorotic. At lower fluence rates, the other two Arabidopsis SOD loci were sufficient to protect chloroplasts from photo-oxidation. Reproductive analyses of fsd2 mutants revealed a significant reduction in fertility for actively photosynthesizing plants but had minimal effect on stressed plants (Table 1). The rather small effect of this mutation on fertility after stress demonstrates the reduction in photosynthetic rates creates less superoxide production in the chloroplasts. The absence of a fertility phenotype indicates that the other two SODs work redundantly and scavenge the residual superoxide generated."

            "text": "In this study, we measured how three class III peroxidase loci affected ROS metabolism and ovule abortion. The nomenclature of class III peroxidases in Arabidopsis varies, where both PER or PRX have been used. In earlier studies, PER17 was reported to modulate lignification and pod shatter [19], and PER28 was hypothesized to affect pollen-pistil interactions [40]. We found that PER17, PER28, and PER29 affected H2O2 production in ovules. Mutation of individual loci showed modest increases in peroxide accumulation (Figure 5). The significant increase in ROS shown in Figure 4 indicates these pistil-specific peroxidases work together to cause this increase in activity.\nPlants 2023, 12, 2182 9 of 14\nThe level of PER17 mRNA increased after 24 h of stress, while the expression of PER28 and PER29 was repressed under these conditions (Figure 3C). Following salt stress, per17, per17per28, per17per28, and per17per28per29 mutants exhibited significantly lower fertility (Figure 3B) than unstressed counterparts (Figure 3A). One simple explanation for this is that increased PER17 activity after salt stress limits ovule failure. Conversely, per28, per29, and per28per29 mutants showed significant ovule abortion rates in healthy plants, but not after environmental stress (Table 1), indicating that PER28 and PER29 scavenge peroxides in healthy plants but have negligible activity in those that are salt-stressed. These data suggest that under normal conditions, all three PER genes scavenge ROS in ovules or nearby areas to which this molecule can diffuse, thereby protecting ovules from abortion. When encountering salt stress, PER17 remains an influential peroxide scavenger that removes ROS. We observed ROS accumulation after salt stress in ovules of three peroxidase mutants (Figure 4), which indicated that either the rate of ROS removal decreased or its synthesis accelerated. ROS accumulation further increased in per double and triple mutants (Figure 4). However, the ovule abortion rates in some of the peroxidase mutants were not affected. We cannot distinguish which types of ROS accumulated in these tissues because CH2DCFDA stains many ROS. One or more types of ROS may reach a critical threshold, signaling the described physiological changes. Data reported here show that the induction of ROS accumulation by the mutation of peroxidases was sufficient to increase the rate of seed abortion. It is believed that H2O2 may be a better signaling molecule than other types of ROS because it can cross the plasma membrane and move into neighboring cells. In plants, class III peroxidases can reduce peroxides by using various donor molecules, such as auxin or secondary metabolites (e.g., lignin precursors and phenolic compounds) [19]. Some cell wall peroxidases modulate ROS levels, which affect plant defense or development, but this reaction is strongly pH-dependent [24,41\u201343]. Therefore, we quantified H2O2 levels in our peroxidase mutants. The H2O2 levels in peroxidase single and double mutants were higher than the wild-type controls but were not significantly higher as a result of the high variance. For given genotypes, this variance can be explained by variability in the activity in the family of 70+ peroxidases present in Arabidopsis, which might or might not be due to differences in ovule abortion rates among pistils. Purification of H2O2 is labor intensive, and samples cannot be stored frozen, so the sample size for each genotype was limited. The hydrogen peroxide levels were significantly higher in triple mutants under both unstressed (p < 0.05) and salt-stressed (p < 0.01) conditions (Figure 5). These data correlated with low fertility (Table 1 and Figure 3), indicating H2O2 may be the molecule that causes ovule abortion. According to the expression patterns from GUS staining results, three Class III peroxidases may modulate ROS signaling and/or affect the fertilization process, nutrient transport, and/or pistil growth. PER29::GUS revealed that this gene is active in ovules, especially around the gametophyte (Figure 6j). Sun et al. [28] reported that after salt stress, ROS initially accumulated in the gametophyte and then spread throughout the ovule. Thus, PER29 may be responsible for regulating ROS in the gametophyte prior to fertilization. Together with the fact that PER29 has high levels of expression in healthy controls (Figure 3C), these results explain why the per29 mutants exhibited the lowest relative fertility among the genotypes tested (Figure 3A). The tip growth of pollen tubes requires ROS buildup and the presence of an antioxidant that alters pollen growth in vitro [44]. Before fertilization, a pollen grain adheres to the stigma, and the pollen tube emerges and grows along the transmitting tract, which contains nutrients and signaling molecules that affect pollen tube guidance. Therefore, the fertilization of per17, 28, and 29 mutants was examined. Flowers were emasculated, and pollen tubes were stained 24 h after manual pollination [45]. After 24 h, pollen tubes entered 90% of the wild-type, per28, and per29 ovules, but only 50% of the per17 pollen tubes reached an ovule. Since per17 had 70% fertility (Table 1), we conclude that pollen tube\nPlants 2023, 12, 2182 10 of 14\ngrowth occurs more slowly or pollen tube guidance is disrupted in this genotype. Wild-type pollen fertilized significantly fewer per17 ovules, which is consistent with a pollen guidance problem. Future experiments are necessary to discriminate between these possibilities. PER28::GUS was expressed in the transmitting track (Figure 6g). When the stigma is most receptive to pollination, PER28 displayed maximal expression in the stigma (Figure 6H). The expression of these genes is consistent with a role in pollen-stigma interaction or pollen tube growth/tracking. However, the pollination and pollen tube growth appeared normal in the per28 mutant. During manual pollination of the pistil, it was noted that the pollen did not adhere as well to the stigma, which suggests the PER28 locus may affect pollen adhesion to the stigma."

            "text": "In a variety of plant cell types and plant species, PCD is induced with a pulse of ROS. Images in this paper show necrosis of the endothelium of stressed ovules, which coincides with ROS accumulation (Figures 3\u20136). Seed abortion is preceded by changes in mitochondrial potential [33]. Previous work shows that similar peroxidases can regulate apoplastic oxidative burst and then PCD in response to fungal infection [46]. When pollen nuclei are delivered to the synergids by the pollen tube, ROS induce PCD in these two cells [47]. This is mediated by the activity of a kinase MAP kinase cascade, which effects synergid PCD and immunity-associated PCD [48]. In tomatoes, disruption of fertilization leads to altered endothelium development and ectopic ROS spikes. This can produce parthenogenic seeds or altered developmental fates [49,50]. In wheat, drought stress increases ROS production and increases yield over a shortened fertility window [51]. In a number of different plants, ROS affect reproductive development by modulating PCD and changing cell fate."

After backcrossing these mutant alleles with wild-type Arabidopsis (Col-0), homozygous mutants were isolated by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Two gene-specific primers from upstream and downstream coding sequences were used to verify the presence of wildtype alleles. One gene-specific primer and one primer from the T-DNA border sequence were used to confirm the presence of the mutant allele (Table S1). All mutants are null mutants since none encode a full-length transcript (Figure 2). Plants were grown in 2 \u00d7 2 pots in a Percival plant growth chamber (Perry, IA) at 24 \u25e6C, 50% relative humidity, and continuous fluorescent light (100 \u00b5mol photon m\u22122 s\u22121). To stress plants, the pots were soaked in irrigated water containing 75 mM NaCl for 6 h, drained, then not irrigated with plain water for an additional 42 h. Healthy seeds and aborted ovules in each silique (developed from pistil) were recorded. From these data, ovule abortion rates and fertility with standard errors were calculated. Before performing ANOVA analysis using JMP8 software (Cary, NC, USA), ovule abortion rates were root arcsine transformed to generate a normal distribution. A normality test was done in JMP8 for all other ANOVA analyses."

Hydroponic propagation was described by Gibeaut et al. [52]. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA) from 1 \u00b5g of total RNA as suggested by the manufacturer. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed in optical 96-well plates using an ABI StepOnePlus machine (Applied Biosys-\nPlants 2023, 12, 2182 11 of 14\ntems, Grand Island, NY, USA). Each 10-\u00b5L reaction consisted of GoTaq qPCR Master Mix (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), 2 \u00b5L of 1:50 diluted cDNA, and 0.2 mM each of genespecific primer pairs (see Table S1). The following thermal profile was used for qPCR: 95 \u25e6C for 2 min; 30 cycles of 95 \u25e6C for 15 s and 60 \u25e6C for 1 min; and a melt curve analysis at 95 \u25e6C for 15 s, 60 \u25e6C for 15 s, and 95 \u25e6C for 15 s. CT and standard curve were extracted using ABI StepOne v2.2 software (Grand Island, NY, USA). The fold change of gene expression and standard deviations were calculated according to the guide from ABI (http://www.appliedbiosystems.com/absite/us/en/home/support/tutorials.html, accessed on 6 April 2023). Melt curve analyses were used to verify that a single product was produced from each qPCR."

In the presence of ROS, CH2DCFDA was oxidized to form carboxy-dichloro-fluorescein (CDCF), which is highly fluorescent. The CDCF was visualized by excitation between 490 and 510 nm, and the fluorescent emissions were detected using a 520 nm long-pass filter. This filter set detects both CDCF emission (green) and plant cell auto-fluorescence (red). Flowers were frozen in N2(l). Using a steel block immersed in N2(l) and frozen forceps, pistils were dissected from flowers, and pistil length was measured with a dissecting microscope. After the pistils were ground to powder, 0.1 mL of 0.2 M HClO4 was added to stop all protein activity. To ensure that wound-induced H2O2 was not produced, samples were kept frozen until they were dissolved in HClO4. Samples were kept in this buffer at 0 \u25e6C for 5 min and then centrifuged at 20,800\u00d7 g for 10 min at 4 \u25e6C. The supernatant was neutralized with 110 \u00b5L of 0.2 M NH4OH and was centrifuged again at 3000\u00d7 g. The supernatant was passed through a column of AG resin (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and then eluted with 0.1 mL deionized water. Amplex Red Peroxidase Assay Kit (Invitrogen, A22188) was used to quantify H2O2 levels in the extracts, as recommended by the manufacturer. Fluorescence was measured using Synergy HT fluorescence plate reader (Bio-Tek, Highland Park, IL, USA) with excitation/emission at 540/590 nm. Fluorescence intensity was measured every 10 min to ensure that fluorescence detection of the standards and unknown samples exhibited a linear relationship between accumulation and time. The concentration of H2O2 in the samples was calculated using a standard curve with HRP of known activity, which was included with the kit as a standard."

            "text": "The pEW201ML plasmid was created to contain the PER17 coding sequence (upstream) that is translationally fused to the GFP coding sequence (downstream) and is driven by the CAMV 35S promoter. Similarly, the pEW202ML and pEW203ML binary plasmids were created to contain PER28 and PER29 with translationally fused GFP, respectively. Plants were transformed with this A. tumefaciens containing the plasmid, according to Clough and Bent [53]. Transformants were selected by spraying 1000-fold diluted BASTA (Finale, AgrEvo, Pikeville, NC, USA). To synthesize proteins for the assay, PER17, 28, and 29 genes were ectopically expressed using CaMV 35S promoter. The pEW401ML plasmid (35S::myc-PER17) contains the PER17 coding sequence and an upstream in-frame myc tag (MEQKLISEEDL). The pEW402ML and pEW403ML plasmids contain, respectively, PER28 and PER29, each with a myc tag. Transformants containing each construct were generated as described above. Myc-tagged protein expression was confirmed in these transformants (Figure S1). Total soluble proteins were extracted from 12-day-old seedlings. The extraction buffer contained 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 1X protease inhibitor cocktail VI (RPI Corp), and 0.2 M \u03b2-mercaptoethanol. Prior to binding, each well of the FLUOTRAC 600 immunology plate (Greiner Bio-One, Monroe,\nPlants 2023, 12, 2182 12 of 14\nNC, USA) was coated with a 0.5 \u00b5g myc-tag antibody (Millipore, Billerica, MA) at 4 \u25e6C overnight as described by Pratt et al. [54]. After washing and blocking, myc-tagged proteins were fished from total protein extracts (1 mg of myc-PER17; 0.9 mg of myc-PER28; and 0.8 mg of myc-PER29). Following additional washes, Amplex Red was applied to determine the activity of myc-peroxidases as recommended by the manufacturer. Fluorescence was measured with excitation/emission at 540/590 nm. The relative fluorescence of each myc-peroxidase was normalized with wild-type controls in each experimental replicate. To construct PER17::GUS, 1.9 kbp of PER17 upstream sequence was PCR amplified and transcriptionally fused to the upstream of the uidA gene start codon [55]. PER28::GUS and PER29::GUS constructs were created similarly. GUS assays were done as previously described [56]."

A simple hypothesis explaining the results reported here is that PER17 and PER29 proteins, which are predominantly expressed in ovules, cause oxidative bursts in ovules, inducing ovule abortion.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/plants12112182/s1, Figure S1: SDS PAGE of Myc-PER fusion proteins; Table S1: Primers used for genotyping and cloning.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, Y.-Y.W. and B.A.H.; methodology Y.-Y.W. and B.A.H.; investigation, Y.-Y.W., D.J.H.; original draft preparation, Y.-Y.W.; writing, review, and editing, all authors; supervision, project administration, and funding acquisition, B.A.H.
