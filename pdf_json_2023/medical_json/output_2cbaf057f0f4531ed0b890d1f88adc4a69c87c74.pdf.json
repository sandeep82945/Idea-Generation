    "abstractText": "Owing to the potentially harmful adverse effects of current anti-inflammatory drugs, there is a need to identify new alternative substances. Thus, this study aimed to perform a phytochemical analysis of A. polyphylla to identify compounds responsible for its antiinflammatory activity. Several fractions of the A. polyphylla extract were obtained and evaluated in an ex vivo anti-inflammatory assay using fresh human blood. Among the evaluated fractions, the BH fraction displayed the highest percentage of PGE2 inhibition (74.8%) compared to the reference drugs dexamethasone and indomethacin, demonstrating its excellent potential for anti-inflammatory activity. Astragalin (P1), a known 3-O-glucoside of kaempferol, was isolated from the A. polyphylla extract for the first time. In addition, a new compound (P2) was isolated and identified as the apigenin3-C-glycosylated flavonoid. Astragalin showed moderate PGE2 activity (48.3%), whereas P2 was not anti-inflammatory. This study contributes to the phytochemical studies of A. polyphylla and confirms its anti-inflammatory potential.",

For data processing, the Lab solution\u00ae software was used. Analyzes were performed on a Shim-pack VP-ODS column (250 \u00d7 4.6 mm id, 5 \u00b5m; Shimadzu) with a flow rate of 1.0 mL.min-1 and preparative HPLC, separations were\nperformed using a Shim-pack pack VP Column -ODS (250 \u00d7 20 mm id, 5 \u03bcm; Shimadzu) at a flow rate of 10 mL.min-1 with UV detection 241 nm. The solvents used were acidified water (0.1% acetic acid) as solvent A and methanol as solvent C, in the isocratic mode as follows: 25% C in 23 minutes. This procedure allowed the isolation of two compounds astragalin P1 (2.5 mg) (Ghavam-Haghi; Sadeghi Dinani, 2017; Riaz et al., 2018) and a new apigenin-3-C-glycosylated type flavonoid P2 (2 mg, Kumamoto et al. 1986).\nPreparation of fractions for the anti-inflammatory assay\nSeveral traditional separation methods were used to obtain the fractions. Initially,\nusing approximately 4 grams of the crude extract of A. polyphylla, it was submitted to the column chromatography (CC) technique, where a common silica column of approximately 5 cm in diameter and 26 cm in height was used. The eluents were used in gradient mode: hexane, ethyl acetate, and methanol. The fractions were dried and grouped according to their chromatographic profile in sequence. Afterward, the two fractions with the most significant mass were separated. One was subjected to a column with an internal diameter of 2.5 cm and 2.0 m in height, packed with (1.8 meters) of Sephadex\u00ae LH20 Sigma polymer -Aldrich using methanol as eluent. Again, the samples were dried in the hood and sequence, the chromatographic profile was performed using TLC, and the fractions were grouped. Due to its high polarity, the other fraction was subjected to solid phase extraction, type C18 (Octadecylsilane); column conditioning was previously performed with 40 mL of methanol and 80 mL of water, using a manifold and a vacuum pump. Ultimately, the fractions of interest were reserved for the ex-vivo antiinflammatory assay (Figure S1)."

            "text": "In evaluating anti-inflammatory activity, a validated ex vivo assay using human\nblood was used (Rosa et al. 2021). Initially, the fractions samples were solubilized in EtOH:H2O 7:3 (v:v), and then the cleanup was performed in duplicate with 300 \u00b5L of hexane. Fresh, heparinized human blood was plated in 96-well plates (200 \u00b5l per well) and treated with 10 \u00b5g/ml of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce inflammation. Subsequently, the plate was incubated with samples obtained from fractionation (10 \u03bcg/mL), pure substances (1 \u03bcg/mL) from A. polyphylla and controls (1 \u03bcg/mL). The commercial drugs indomethacin and dexamethasone were used as the positive control. For the negative control, LPS was incubated with blood without any treatment. For\nnegative control, LPS was incubated with blood without any treatment. The final volume in each well was 250 \u00b5L, and all dilutions were made using PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline), a buffer solution of phosphate salts used as a cell culture medium. The test was performed in triplicates. After incubation at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 atmosphere for 24 h, the plate was centrifuged (1000 rpm for 5 min, 4\u00b0C). Thus, obtaining the plasma of the replica of each sample. Subsequently, plasma samples were subjected to protein precipitation and purification. 500 \u03bcL of MeOH:ACN 1:1 (v:v) was initially added to 100 \u03bcL of plasma from each replicate. The samples were homogenized in a vortex shaker, and for complete protein precipitation, the samples were centrifuged at 6000 rpm at 4 \u00b0C. The obtained supernatants were diluted in 4.5 mL of ultrapure water to reduce the amount of the MeOH: ACN mixture. Subsequently, purification by SPE was performed in three stages, namely:\n\u2022 Cartridge conditioning: 2 ml of MeOH was applied to the cartridge, and then 2\nml of a 0.1% acetic acid aqueous solution.\n\u2022 Insertion of the sample in the cartridge: after inserting the sample, another 2 mL\nof the 0.1% acetic acid solution was applied to purify and eliminate interfering elements from the plasma matrix.\n\u2022 Sample elution: Finally, 2 mL of MeOH containing 0.1% acetic acid is used to\nelute the sample.\nPurified samples were concentrated for 8 h in the Speed Vacuum equipment\nwithout light and heat. After this period, the dried samples were resuspended in an ACN solution containing the standard internal chloramphenicol (CAP, 25 ng/mL) and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Quantifying PGE2 was performed using the MRM method and comparing the area under the curve of the chromatographic peaks with a previously determined linear calibration curve. The blood was collected from healthy volunteers who had not used antiinflammatories or the antibiotic chloramphenicol (CAP) for at least 15 days before collection. Participation was authorized by the Research Ethics Committee of the Federal University of Alfenas (Unifal-MG) under number 60344622.1.0000.5142, and participants signed a consent form for data collection."
