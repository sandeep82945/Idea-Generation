    "abstractText": "Natural cellulose, a sustainable bioresource, is highly abundant in nature. Cellulosic materials, particularly those that explore and employ such materials for industrial use, have recently attracted significant global attention in the field of material science because of the unique properties of cellulose. The hydroxyl groups enable the formation of intraand inter-molecular hydrogen bonding and the arrangement of cellulose chains in a highly ordered crystalline zone, with the remaining disordered structure referred to as an amorphous region. The crystalline areas of cellulose are well-known as cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs). In the present study, we extracted CNCs from pure cellulose isolated from waste jute fibers by sulfuric acid hydrolysis, followed by characterization. Pure cellulose was isolated from jute fibers by treating with sodium hydroxide (20% w/w) and anthraquinone (0.5%) solution at 170 \u25e6C for 2 h, followed by bleaching with chlorine dioxide and hydrogen peroxide solution. CNCs were isolated from pure cellulose by treating with different concentrations (58% to 62%) of sulfuric acid at different time intervals (20 min to 45 min). The FTIR study of the CNCs reveals no peak at 1738 cm\u22121, which confirms the absence of hemicellulose in the samples. The CNCs obtained after 45 min of acid hydrolysis are rod-shaped, having an average length of 800 \u00b1 100 nm and width of 55 \u00b1 10 nm, with a high crystallinity index (90%). Zeta potential significantly increased due to the attachment of SO4 ions on the surface of CNC from \u22121.0 mV to about \u221230 mV, with the increment of the reaction time from 20 min to 45 min, which proved the higher stability of CNC suspension. Crystallinity increased from 80% to 90% when the reaction time was increased from 20 to 45 min, respectively, while a crystallite size from 2.705 to 4.56 nm was obtained with an increment of the acid concentration. Acid hydrolysis enhanced crystallinity but attenuated the temperature corresponding to major decomposition (Tmax) at 260 \u25e6C and the beginning of degradation (Ti) at 200 \u25e6C due to the attachment of SO4 ions on the surface, which decreased the thermal stability of CNC. The second degradation at 360 \u25e6C indicated the stable crystal structure of CNC. The endothermic peak at 255 \u25e6C in the DTA study provided evidence of sulfated nanocrystal decomposition and the recrystallization of cellulose I to cellulose II, the most stable structure among the other four celluloses. The proposed easy-to-reproduce method can successfully and efficiently produce CNCs from waste jute fibers in a straightforward way.",

            "text": "French scientist Anselme Payen discovered cellulose in 1838 after isolating it from plant tissue and figuring out its chemical composition [1]. Cellulose is a water-insoluble\nPolymers 2023, 15, 1530. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym15061530 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2023, 15, 1530 2 of 15\nfibrous material and the most prevalent natural polymer on the planet, as well as an essential structural constituent of the cell wall of a variety of plants. In addition to plants, it is also found in a vast array of other organisms, including algae, fungi, bacteria, and even tunicates [2]. Cellulose is made of glucopyranose units through \u03b2-1,4-linkage with the formation of a high molecular weight, long-chain homopolymer, in which each monomer component is coiled at an angle of 180\u25e6 concerning its neighbors [3,4]. Cellulose I, II, IIII, IIIII, IVI, and IVII are six interchangeable polymorphs whose constituents differ by source [5]. Native cellulose I is present in microorganisms, algae, higher plants, and tunicate [6,7]. Cellulose I conversion into cellulose II form is seen in mercerized cotton and regenerated cellulose. Cellulose III is developed by processing native cellulose with ethylamine or ammonia. Heating cellulose IIII or IIIII in glycerol at 260 \u25e6C generates polymorphs IVI and IVII [3,8,9]. Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), also known as nano-whiskers, are rigid, rod-shaped, or spherical particles of 30 nm or less in width and a few hundred (100\u20131000) nm long, composed of cellulose chain fragments with an almost flawless crystalline arrangement [3,10]. Nanocrystals are more robust, biocompatible, sustainable, stiffer, renewable, optically transparent, nontoxic, lightweight, gas impermeable, biodegradable, modulus, and liquid crystalline than bulk cellulose [11,12]. These outstanding properties draw the attention of global researchers, consequently leading to vast application of CNC in numerous fields, such as the pharmaceutical industry, food industry, polymer industry, paper-making industry, catalysis, energy and electronic sector, environment sector, and so on [4,13\u201316]. In the very beginning, Nickerson and Habrle used acid hydrolysis to prepare CNCs, where Rnby discovered micro-cellulose suspension in 1951 [4,12]. According to the literature, CNCs are also isolated from various natural resources, specifically from agro-waste such as rice straw, corn husk, cotton linter, sugar palm fibers, oil palm fronds, cassava bagasse, doum leaves, pineapple leaves, sugarcane bagasse, coconut husk fibers, banana, mengkuang leaves, apple pomace, kenaf bast, bamboo, and date palm [12,17,18]. To synthesize CNCs and nanocellulose, different methods and processes were addressed by various researchers, such as hydrolysis with sulfuric acid [18], hydrochloric acid [19], phosphoric acid [20], formic acid [21], the mechanical method [22], the enzymatic method [23], treatment with ionic liquid [24], the oxidative method [25], ultrasonic-chemical mixed [26], and the ultrasonic method [27]. The performance, morphology, and properties of CNCs greatly depend on the sources of cellulose and the extraction process [28]. The researchers of this work used waste jute fiber, an agro-waste, as the choice of starting material because of its excellent characteristics, such as biodegradability, low cost, low density, nontoxicity, and biocompatibility [29,30]. Jute bast fiber is made from the inner bast tissue of the plant\u2019s stem bark of Corchorus olitorius (Tossa jute) and Corchorus capsularis (white jute). The former is used in micro- and nano-research and commercial applications to obtain cellulose. Jute stem contains a high volume of cellulose (63% for capsularis and 59% for olitorius) that can be harvested in 4\u20136 months, saving the forest, and meeting the world\u2019s cellulose and wood needs [29\u201331]. According to the literature, waste jute fiber is very rarely used as the primary CNC source. In this study, we produced cellulose nano-whiskers from waste jute fibers using the most efficient method of sulfuric acid hydrolysis, followed by the application of a new technique for the extraction of CNC using a low-density organic solvent through centrifugation, which took significantly less time than the usual membrane dialysis method, which typically requires 4\u20135 days [32]. In contrast to employing organic solvents, in this instance, cellulose extraction was also carried out using low-concentration alkali pretreatment, followed by high-concentration alkali treatment at a high temperature with anthraquinone for cellulose pulping.\nPolymers 2023, 15, 1530 3 of 15"

These jute fibers were soaked in 1 wt% NaOH solution (solid:liquid = 1:10) and treated at 150 \u25e6C for 2 h in a High-Pressure Autoclave Reactor (Model IV; CarlRoth, Germany) to remove most non-cellulosic contents. After pretreatment, reacted jute fibers were removed from the reactor and rinsed with distilled water until red litmus paper showed neutralization. Finally, the washed fiber mass was dried at 60 \u25e6C for 24 h.\n2.2.2. Alkali Treatment of Jute Fiber with Anthraquinone\nTo eliminate hemicellulose, lignin, and other non-cellulosic structures from pretreated dry jute fibers, a 20% (w/w) NaOH and 0.5% anthraquinone mixed solution was used. Dry pretreated fibers were appropriately soaked in the above solution at a solid-to-liquid ratio of 1:20 and placed in the same reactor mentioned above. Delignification was performed at 170 \u25e6C for 2 h. Treated fibers were collected from the reactor and washed with distilled water until neutralization. Alkali-extracted pulp was bleached by several steps using ClO2 bleaching\u2013NaOH extraction\u2013ClO2 bleaching\u2013NaOH extraction\u2013H2O2 bleaching.

Additionally, suspended CNCs were then dispersed in 2:1 acetone in water and extracted by centrifuging several times at 8000 rpm for 5 min. Following each extraction, the sediment was collected and reconstituted in distilled water. Then, a probe sonicator (probe #6, start time 1 s, finish time 0.5 s) was used to sonicate the suspension at room temperature for 20 min in order to disperse the crystals into a stable suspension. Cellulose nanocrystal suspensions were dried in an oven drier at 100 \u25e6C for 30 h. A mortar and pestle smashed tiny film-like crystals into powder. A nano-sieve separated nanocrystal powder and collected it into vials, weighed, and leveled the CNC powder. The percent yield of nanocrystals was calculated based on the initial cellulose amount."

To measure the crystallinity of materials, a profile analysis was performed using a peak fitting tool using Gaussian line forms. With the help of a 10 kV X-ray generator (Rigaku RINT2000), the X-ray diffraction pattern was obtained using Kb-filtered Cu k\u03b1 radiation. Origin 2019 pro software was used to evaluate the crystallinity and crystallite size of each tested sample. The crystallinity index and crystallite size for all samples were determined using the formula described earlier [33,34].\n2.4.4. Thermal Analysis\nThe thermal stability, crystalline nature, and pyrolysis behavior of nanocrystal polymers were measured by different thermal analyses, such as TG (thermogravimetry), DTG (derivative thermogravimetry), and DTA (differential thermal analysis), with the help of the TG/DTA EXTAR 6000 STATION, Seiko Instrument Inc., Chiba, Japan.

            "text": "Nanocellulose can be prepared by hydrolyzing cellulose with acid (sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid), oxidation by TEMPO, the mechanical method, the biological enzyme method, and the steam explosion method [5,10,19]. The acid hydrolysis method is simple, and at the same time, the acid could be recovered. Its degraded sugar by-products can be used for fermentation to produce biofuel. Therefore, acid hydrolysis is still the main method for the rapid preparation of nanocellulose. While using sulfuric acid to prepare CNC, sulfate groups are attached to the surface of cellulose nanocrystals. This results in electrostatic repulsion among the CNCs, and thus stabilizes aqueous CNC suspensions. In addition to sulfuric acid, other acids such as hydrochloric acid and phosphoric acid can also be used to prepare nanocellulose, but their preference is less than that of sulfuric acid due to the production of less stable suspensions caused by the absence of charges at the CNCs\u2019 surface [10]. In the present study, we have used anthraquinone (AQ) as an oxidant in the soda pulping process of waste jute fibers to remove lignin from the jute fibers. It acts as a catalyst for redox reactions, which occur during the pulping process for the removal of lignin. AQ helps to increase the rate of removal of lignin, decrease the degradation of carbohydrate, increase the pulp yield, and enable the process with reduced time [12]. From the investigation, it was found that the cellulose nano-whiskers\u2019 particle size length was around 800 nm, with some variance. Kasyapi reported nano-whiskers from jute with a slightly different approach, approximately 550 nm, which is lower than this experiment [33]. In contrast, other sources, such as tunicates and valonia, produced cellulose nanocrystals greater than 1000 nm [35,36]. Table 1 demonstrates that a high reaction time with a comparatively high acid concentration yielded significantly smaller nanocrystals. Cellulose is a polysaccharide composed of D-glucopyranose linked by the 1,4-\u03b2 glycoside bond. The hydroxyl groups in each glucose unit form a strong hydrogen bond with the adjacent glucose unit in the same chain and with the different chain with the formation of a strong ordered hydrogen bond network, called the crystalline region\nPolymers 2023, 15, 1530 5 of 15\nand the amorphous region, corresponding to parts where the bonds are broken, and the ordered arrangement is lost [3]. Strong acid treatment of the cellulose causes it to hydrolyze the amorphous region, keeping the crystalline region unaffected. Treatment with a high concentration of acid for a long time completely degrades the amorphous region, which might be responsible for the smaller grain length of CNCs [10]. The percent yield value of the prepared CNCs also decreases due to the increased concentration of sulfuric acid and the treatment time.\nCellulose nanocrystal size distribution is shown in Figure 1, in which CN-1, CN-3, and CN-5 are positively skewed distribution curves, whereas CN-2, CN-4, and CN-6 infer standard distribution curves. It implies that a shorter reaction time produces nanocrystals with a higher range toward comparatively higher length sizes; on the other hand, a longer reaction time produces a smaller range of nanocrystals with shorter length sizes. Moreover, these size distribution curves manifest a slight increase in the acid concentration, giving rise to shorter lengths of cellulose nanocrystals. Other researchers have similarly documented the impact of the reaction temperature and acid concentration on the CNC length [37].\n1"

This electro-\nPolymers 2023, 15, 1530 6 of 15\nstatic repulsion constrains the particles from combining with each other and thus explains the stability of CNC particles in an aqueous suspension [38]. The average values of the zeta potential of different samples are listed in Table 1. Zeta potential frequency distribution curves are sketched in Figure 2 and depict the average zeta potential values of the prepared nano-whiskers\u2019 suspensions. A noteworthy change in zeta potential values took place in terms of the reaction time: nanocrystals produced with a higher reaction time (45 min) exhibited a greater surface charge, in the range of around \u221228 mV to \u221237 mV, in comparison with a lower reaction time (20 min), which developed a very minor level of surface charge of about \u22120.9 mV to \u22121.61 mV. A higher reaction time enhanced the attachment of SO42\u2212 ions on the surface of immediately produced nanocrystals, resulting in a greater surface negative potential. Cellulose nanocrystal suspensions are considered stable when the zeta potential value is more than 30 mV, whereas absolute values less than 15 mV are considered responsible for particle agglomeration; hence, CN-1, CN-3, and CN-5 showed larger particle sizes [38,39]. Figure 3 displays an inference that smaller nanocrystals produced for CN-2, CN-4, and CN-6, due to less agglomeration because of higher zeta potential values with a higher reaction time and concentration, attained more stability.\n1"

Between 250 \u00b0C and 350 \u00b0C, the weight loss of the samples was caused by the degradation of cellulose due to decomposition of glycosyl units with the formation of burnt residue. The weight loss of the samples at the end of the TGA run could result from the breakdown and oxidation of the burnt residue into volatile products with lower molecular weights [45]. The first degradation peak indicated the evaporation of water molecules from the sample [46,47].

Acid hydrolysis was conducted for 20 min and 45 min with 58%, 60%, and 62% sulfuric acid concentrations. These variations in parameters produced rod-shaped cellulose nanocrystals. These nanocrystals showed a high degree of crystallinity (above 90%) with a length of 800 \u00b1 100 nm and a diameter of 55 \u00b1 10 nm. As a potential candidate of cellulose nanocrystals, jute fiber produced nanowhiskers with an aspect ratio of above 14. These were characterized by using different techniques, such as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetry (TGA), differential thermal analysis (DTA), Nano Zeta Sizer (DLS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Ther fore, wa te jute fiber can be considered a romising source of cellulose nanocrystals for further bio-nanocomposite applications.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, A.A.C. and M.R.H.; methodology, A.A.C., M.S.R. and M.A.R.; software, M.S.R. and M.P.M.; validation, A.A.C., M.S.R. and M.F.K.T.; formal analysis, A.A.C. and M.S.R.; investigation, M.S.R., M.A.R., M.P.M. and M.F.K.T.; resources, J.A.C., S.K. and M.S.A.; data curation, M.S.R.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, M.S.R., A.A.C. and J.A.C.; writing\u2014review and editing, M.S.R., A.A.C., M.S.A., S.K. and J.A.C.; visualization, A.A.C., M.R.H., J.A.C. and M.S.A.; supervision, A.A.C.; project administration, A.A.C. and M.R.H.; funding acquisition, A.A.C. and M.R.H.
