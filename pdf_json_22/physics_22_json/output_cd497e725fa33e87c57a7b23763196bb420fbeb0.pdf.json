INTRODUCTION\nA Majorana fermion1 is a charge-neutral particle satisfying the Dirac equation and which, contrarily to ordinary Dirac fermions,2,3\ncoincides with its own antiparticle. In high-energy physics, all fermionic particles in the standard model are Dirac fermions with perhaps one exception, neutrinos, which might be instead Majorana fermions.4 In condensed matter, Dirac and Majorana fermions emerge as low-energy quasiparticle excitations5,6 realized in, e.g., superfluid helium-3,7,8 graphene,9 topological insulators, and superconductors.6,10\u201316 In particular, pointlike (0D) Majorana modes are spatially separated, zero-energy quasiparticle excitations localized at the vortices of a two-dimensional (2D) topological superconductor or superfluid17\u201323 or at the boundaries of the nontrivial phase of a one-dimensional (1D) topological superconductor.24\u201326 Majorana fermions in condensed matter physics and Majorana fermions in high-energy physics are connected by the fact that the effective theory describing collective\nexcitations in superconductors is analogous to the Dirac\u2013Majorana equation describing a Majorana fermion in quantum field theory, with the vacuum replaced by the superconducting condensate and particle\u2013antiparticle (charge) symmetry replaced by particle\u2013hole symmetry.27\nThe existence of spatially separated Majorana modes in topological superconductors can be explained in terms of topology. Topology studies the properties of geometrical objects which are invariant under continuous transformations. Under the lens of topology, for instance, spheres and cylinders are equivalent since they can be transformed one into the other via a continuous transformation. Conversely, spheres and toruses are distinct, inequivalent objects since they cannot be transformed one into the other via a continuous transformation. This approach can be applied to condensed matter physics: A topological superconductor is a phase of matter which is nontrivial, i.e., topologically distinct from an ordinary superconductor and from the vacuum. A very general statement underlying the physics of topological phases of matter is\nJ. Appl. Phys. 132, 231101 (2022); doi: 10.1063/5.0102999 132, 231101-1\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2022\n18 January 2024 22:46:27\nthat a topologically nontrivial phase must exhibit localized modes at its boundaries.28\u201330 Indeed, a topologically nontrivial phase cannot be connected by a smooth transformation to a trivial phase (e.g., the vacuum) unless the energy gap closes at their shared boundary. In other words, the gap must vanish at the boundary between trivial and nontrivial phases, allowing the topological invariant to change. This mandates the existence of localized modes at the boundary or domain wall between topologically inequivalent phases. These modes are exponentially localized and spatially separated, i.e., their mutual overlap vanishes in the limit of infinite system size, being exponentially small in their mutual distance.\nIntuitively, a Majorana mode corresponds to \u201chalf\u201d a fermion, in the sense that any fermionic operator c can be formally recast in terms of two Majorana operators as\nc \u00bc 1 2 (\u03b3A \u00fe i\u03b3B), (1)\nwhere the operators \u03b3A and \u03b3B are self-adjoint, idempotent, and obey the fermionic anticommutation rules, i.e.,\n\u03b3y\u03b1 \u00bc \u03b3\u03b1 , \u03b32\u03b1 \u00bc \u03b3y\u03b1\u03b3\u03b1 \u00bc 1, {\u03b3\u03b1 , \u03b3\u03b2} \u00bc 2\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 : (2)\nThe Majorana operators \u03b3A \u00bc cy \u00fe c and \u03b3B \u00bc i(cy c) correspond, respectively, to the \u201creal part\u201d and \u201cimaginary part\u201d or, more precisely, to the hermitian and antihermitian parts of the fermion operator c. Like fermions, Majorana operators anticommute but, unlike ordinary fermions, Majorana modes are their own antiparticle. Like bosons, creating two identical Majorana modes is not forbidden by the Pauli principle but, unlike bosons, this operation has no effect since Majorana operators are idempotent.\nThe seemingly harmless transformation in Eq. (1) has profound consequences in the case where the two Majorana modes are spatially separated. Spatial separation requires their wavefunctions to decay exponentially as e x=\u03beM and their mutual distance to be much larger than their localization length L \u03beM, i.e., the limit where their distance becomes effectively infinite L ! 1. Indeed, any spatially-separated mode in a superconductor exhibits very distinctive properties. Consider, e.g., a semi-infinite wire with one mode localized at its end. Due to particle\u2013hole symmetry, every mode with finite positive energy (particle-like) must correspond to a mode with opposite energy (hole-like). However, particle-like and hole-like modes must coincide since there is only one mode at the boundary. For this reason, spatially-separated modes must have zero energy, be self-adjoint, and invariant under the particle\u2013hole symmetry enforced by the superconducting pairing, i.e., must coincide with their own antiparticles. This also means that local perturbations cannot lift the energy of a lonely spatially separated mode from zero as long as the particle\u2013hole gap remains open. Indeed, spatially separated modes can be removed from the boundary only by going through a quantum phase transition which closes the particle\u2013hole gap. Moreover, being an equal superposition of particles and holes, they are necessarily charge-neutral and insensitive to electric and magnetic fields. Furthermore, time-reversal symmetry must be broken to lift the Kramers degeneracy between spin up and down electrons and allow the existence of only one zero-energy\nmode per boundary. Hence, this mode must be spinless, otherwise its energy would be lifted by the broken time-reversal symmetry (e.g., by a finite magnetic field). Spatially-separated zero-energy 0D Majorana modes in 1D systems are usually referred to as Majorana zero modes, Majorana end modes, or Majorana edge modes. A nonlocal fermionic mode c with zero energy which can be decomposed into two spatially separated Majorana zero modes as in Eq. (1) and with\n[H, \u03b3\u03b1] \u00bc 0, (3)\nis usually referred to as a Majorana bound state. The terms Majorana bound states, Majorana zero modes, Majorana end modes, or Majorana edge modes are usually considered nearsynonyms in the literature, with the term \u201cmode\u201d emphasizing the separation of two Majorana modes as distinct entities, and the term \u201cstate\u201d emphasizing the collective existence of two Majorana modes as a nonlocal fermionic state. The splitting of a single fermionic mode into two spatially separated Majorana modes is an example of \u201cfractionalization,\u201d31,32 i.e., the separation of an elementary excitation into distinct quasiparticles.\nNotice that perfectly spatially separated zero-energy modes can be achieved only in infinite-size systems. Unluckily, in the real world, everything is finite: In this case, Majorana modes localized at a finite distance L become hybridized due to the finite overlap between their wavefunctions. This hybridization results in a fermionic mode with a small but finite energy EM . 0. In particular, since Majorana modes are exponentially localized, this energy is exponentially small, i.e., it decreases exponentially with the mutual distance L, being\n[H, cy] \u00bc EMcy, EM / e L=\u03beM , (4) where \u03beM is the Majorana localization length, which depends on the system parameters and diverges at the quantum phase transition between the topologically trivial and nontrivial phases. This exponential scaling is a distinctive fingerprint of topological states of matter, analogous to the quantization of the quantum Hall conductance up to exponentially small corrections.33\u201337\nThere is a fundamental reason why realizing spatially separated Majorana modes is a big deal: these Majorana modes exhibit nonabelian exchange statistics, which make them ideal building blocks for the realization of topological quantum computers.18,38\u201342 A quantum many-body state has a well-defined symmetry under the exchange of identical fermions or bosons. Furthermore, the exchange is an abelian (i.e., commutative) operation, i.e., when applying several exchanges one after another, the final outcome does not depend on the order in which they are performed. Majorana modes are different. The exchange (braiding) of two or more Majorana modes is nonabelian (i.e., noncommutative),18,38,40,43\u201345 i.e., the final outcome does depend on the order in which exchanges are performed. Mathematically, these exchange operations are described by unitary matrices acting on a degenerate many-body groundstate: Applying two or more exchange operations consecutively corresponds to multiplying the groundstate by two or more unitary matrices consecutively. Changing the order of the exchange operations changes the order\nJ. Appl. Phys. 132, 231101 (2022); doi: 10.1063/5.0102999 132, 231101-2\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2022\n18 January 2024 22:46:27\nof the matrix multiplications and thus may change the final outcome, since matrix multiplication is noncommutative. All this requires the existence of a degenerate many-body groundstate: Indeed, the groundstate of a system of 2N Majorana modes is 2N-fold degenerate, with exchange operations corresponding to adiabatic unitary evolutions within the groundstate manifold. In a topological quantum computer, the quantum information is encoded nonlocally in the spatially separated Majorana modes, and the quantum information is manipulated via quantum gates realized via exchange operations. A fundamental advantage is that these exchange operations are independent of the fine details of the adiabatic evolution and only depend on the order in which the exchanges are performed. Moreover, being charge-neutral, nonlocal, and topologically protected, Majorana modes are robust, i.e., their existence remains unscathed as long as the energy scale of perturbations does not exceed the particle\u2013hole energy gap. Indeed, small local perturbations (having a length scale smaller than the distance between the Majorana modes) cannot remove a Majorana mode from one end of a 1D system without concomitantly removing the Majorana mode at the opposite end. Consequently, the only way to destroy Majorana modes is by a perturbation strong enough to close the particle\u2013hole gap, move them close to each other, make their wavefunctions overlap, and split their energy. In ideal conditions, Majorana modes are also free from decoherence since their decay is protected by fermionparity conservation and by the particle\u2013hole gap.24,39 These properties may give them an edge over other possible implementations of quantum computing.24,39,41 On the other hand, these same properties are somewhat a hindrance to the experimental detection and manipulation of Majorana modes and to the readout of the quantum information they encode.\nTheoretically, a topological superconductor supporting spatially separated Majorana end modes can be realized in a 1D lattice of spinless fermions with p-wave superconducting pairing.24 Despite its simplicity, this model is rather unrealistic since spinless fermions do not exist, superconductivity is not stable against quantum fluctuations in 1D,46 and spin-triplet p-wave superconductors are rare in nature.14,16,47 A more realistic proposal is to consider a heterostructure between a topological insulator and a conventional superconductor.23,48\u201353 In this system, the 1D helical edge modes of the topological insulator54\u201356 are gapped by the proximitized superconducting pairing, becoming effectively equivalent to a spinless superconductor. However, it was soon understood that a much simpler recipe to engineer nontrivial superconducting phases includes only three simple ingredients,25,26,57\u201364 i.e., conventional s-wave superconductivity (induced by proximity), spin-orbit coupling, and broken time-reversal symmetry (e.g., magnetic field). Indeed, since Majorana modes are equal superpositions of particle and hole excitations, one needs a superconducting state to enforce the particle\u2013hole symmetry. In addition, one needs to break timereversal symmetry to remove Kramers degeneracy between opposite spin channels, otherwise spin-degenerate modes would simply hybridize in the presence of local perturbations and lift their energy. Finally, spin\u2013orbit coupling is needed to tilt the spin of electrons with the same energy and opposite momenta in different directions: This tilting allows them to form a Cooper pair via proximization with a conventional spin-singlet superconductor and,\ntherefore, effectively realize a spin-triplet p-wave superconducting phase.\nPerhaps, the simplest proposal to realize this physics is that of a semiconducting nanowire with strong spin\u2013orbit coupling and proximitized by a conventional superconductor in an external magnetic field.25,26,61,63,64 These systems, usually dubbed Majorana nanowires, are so far the most actively studied platform to realize Majorana bound states, both theoretically and experimentally. Other nanowire-based setups are possible, e.g., semiconducting nanowires in the presence of magnetic textures,65 nuclear magnetic order,66,67 periodic arrays of nanomagnets,68,69 or helical-magnetic superconducting compounds,70 semiconducting nanowires fully coated with a superconducting shell (full-shell nanowires),71,72 or covered by both superconducting and ferromagnetic layers,73\u201378 metallic nanowires,79,80 topological-insulator nanowires,81\u201385 or second-order topological-insulator nanowires at zero fields.86 Furthermore, many other 1D platforms have been proposed, including 1D stripes in 2D semiconductor-superconductor planar heterostructures (e.g., planar Josephson junctions)87\u201398 or in topological insulator-superconductor heterostructures,99 thin films of proximitized 3D topological insulators covered by a strip of magnetic insulators,100 arrays of superconducting quantum dots,101\u2013103 arrays of magnetic atoms deposited on a conventional superconductor substrate,66,67,104\u2013117 carbon-based setups such as proximitized carbon nanotubes,118\u2013120 graphene nanoribbons,121,122 1D channels obtained via electrostatic confinement in bilayer graphene,123 or in armchair edge states of encapsulated bilayer graphene,124 and optically trapped 1D lattices of ultracold fermionic atoms in a Zeeman field with intrinsic attractive interactions or coupled to a surrounding molecular BEC cloud.125\u2013129 Moreover, dispersive 1D or 2D Majorana modes may be realized as edge or surface modes of 2D or 3D topological superconductors51,130\u2013137 (see Refs. 14, 16, and 138 for a review) or, alternatively, as the result of the hybridization of arrays of 0D Majorana modes139\u2013141 or in the presence of additional synthetic dimensions.142\nIn principle, Majorana modes should exhibit distinctive experimental signatures in the tunneling conductance,64,143\u2013147 ballistic point contact conductance,148 Josephson current,23,25,26,48,149\u2013163 and Coulomb blockade spectroscopy.164\u2013169 Besides, due to their topological nature, these signatures should persist in a large parameter range. Indeed, there are already many experimental observations compatible with the presence of spatially separated and topologically protected Majorana modes in Majorana nanowires, such as zero-bias conductance peaks,170\u2013186 fractional Josephson current,187,188 and Coulomb blockade experiments.176,189\u2013194 Nevertheless, there is still no consensus on the interpretation of these signatures, which may indeed have alternative explanations.195\u2013199 Furthermore, some concerns were raised about some of these experiments (see Refs. 200 and 201).\nThere are several popular accounts202\u2013208 and reviews on Majorana modes and topological superconductors,14,16,138,209\u2013216 mainly focusing on Majorana modes in 1D systems,209,214\u2013223 their experimental realization,222,224\u2013230 their applications in the field of topological quantum computation,41,211,215,231\u2013240 and their connection to other topological states of matter.6,10\u201312 In this tutorial, I will present a pedagogical review on Majorana modes and topological superconductivity in Majorana nanowires and their relevance\nJ.

For simplicity, we choose \u0394 to be real. Introducing the Nambu spinor \u03a8y(x) \u00bc [\u03a8y(x), \u03a8(x)], and by formally substituting \u03a8y(x)\u03a8(x) ! (\u03a8y(x)\u03a8(x) \u03a8(x)\u03a8y(x))=2, the continuum Hamiltonian can be rewritten in the Bogoliubov\u2013 de Gennes (BdG) form as H \u00bc 12 \u00d0 dx\u03a8y(x)H(x)\u03a8(x), with Hamiltonian density\nH(x) \u00bc p 2 x\n2m \u03bc\n\u03c4z \u00fe \u0394\nh px \u03c4y , (6)\nwhere \u03c4xyz are the Pauli matrices. Notice that, with the assumption \u0394 [ R, the Hamiltonian is real. In the momentum basis, the Hamiltonian becomes H \u00bc 12 \u00d0 dk\u03a8y(k)H(k)\u03a8(k) with\nH(k) \u00bc h 2k2\n2m \u03bc\n\u03c4z \u00fe \u0394k \u03c4y , (7)\nwhere the Nambu spinor in momentum space is \u03a8y(k) \u00bc [\u03a8y(k), \u03a8( k)]. The energy dispersion is given by a particle Ek 0 and hole Ek 0 branches with\nEk \u00bc ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi \u03b52k \u00fe \u03942k2 q , (8)\nwhere \u03b5k \u00bc h2k2=2m \u03bc. Contrarily to the case of a conventional s-wave superconductor which is always gapped, the energy dispersion becomes gapless at k \u00bc 0 for \u03bc \u00bc 0, i.e., when the chemical potential is fine-tuned to the bottom of the conduction band. This is a direct consequence of the odd-parity symmetry of the superconducting pairing \u0394k, which is an odd function of the momentum: The particle\u2013hole gap can close only at k \u00bc 0 if the bare electron dispersion \u03b5k vanishes altogether. The closing of\nthe particle\u2013hole gap at \u03bc \u00bc 0 coincides with a topological phase transition between topologically distinct phases for \u03bc , 0 and \u03bc . 0.\nNote that the phase with \u03bc , 0 remains gapped for \u0394 \u00bc 0 and, consequently, can be continuously deformed into a trivial insulator by switching off the superconducting pairing without closing the particle\u2013hole gap. Hence, this phase is topologically trivial. On the other hand, the gapped phase with \u03bc . 0 becomes gapless for \u0394 \u00bc 0 and thus cannot be continuously deformed into a trivial insulator. This phase is topologically distinct from the trivial phase. Topologically distinct phases correspond to topologically distinct mappings between the momentum k and the Hamiltonian density. To see this, let us rewrite the Hamiltonian density as\nH(k) \u00bc h(k) \u03c4, (9)\nwith\nh(k) \u00bc [0, \u0394k, \u03b5k], jh(k)j \u00bc Ek, (10)\nand consider the mapping between the momentum k[ [ 1, \u00fe1] to the unit vector u(k) \u00bc h(k)=jh(k)j moving on the yz plane of the unit sphere. The y component of the unit vector goes from negative to positive values from k \u00bc 1 to k \u00bc 1 for \u0394 . 0 (and from positive to negative for \u0394 , 0). For \u03bc , 0, one has \u03b5k . 0 for all momenta, and thus the z component of the unit vector is always positive with u(k) \u00bc [0, 0, 1] for k \u00bc 0 and k ! +1. In this case, the unit vector describes a circular arc as the momentum varies from k \u00bc 1 to \u00fe1, as shown in Fig. 1(a). For \u03bc . 0 instead, \u03b5k changes its sign from positive at k \u00bc 1 to negative at k \u00bc 0 and back to positive values at k \u00bc \u00fe1. Thus, the z component is positive at large momenta and negative at small momenta, with u(k) \u00bc [0, 0, 1] for k \u00bc +1 and u(k) \u00bc [0, 0, 1] for k \u00bc 0. In this case, the unit vector describes a full circle as the momentum varies from k \u00bc 1 to \u00fe1, as shown in Fig. 1(b). The trajectories followed by the unit vector are topologically distinct: a circular arc for \u03bc , 0 and a full circle for \u03bc . 0, characterized by a different winding number. The winding number W is defined as the total number of turns that the unit vector u(k) makes around the origin in the yz plane as the momentum varies from k \u00bc 1 to \u00fe1, with positive or negative signs corresponding to anticlockwise or clockwise directions, respectively. Hence, the winding number is W \u00bc 0 for \u03bc , 0, while it is W \u00bc +1 for \u03bc . 0 with the sign equal to the sign of the superconducting pairing \u0394. The phase with winding number W \u00bc 0 is topologically trivial, whereas the phases with W \u00bc +1 are topologically nontrivial. The trivial and nontrivial phases correspond to the so-called strong-pairing and weak-pairing, as I will discuss in Sec. II C.\nThe Hamiltonian in Eqs. (6) and (7) is equivalent to a 1D Dirac Hamiltonian with a Dirac mass M \u00bc \u03bc=\u03942 and a quadratic correction / k2 (assuming \u0394 . 0). The quantum phase transition between the topologically trivial M . 0 (i.e., \u03bc , 0) and nontrivial M , 0 (i.e., \u03bc . 0) phase coincide with the inversion of the gap M.6,241 The BdG Hamiltonian describing quasiparticle states in a superconductor is analogous to the Dirac equation of a Majorana fermion, where the vacuum is replaced by the superconducting condensate and the role of particle\u2013antiparticle symmetry by\nJ.

The connection to the Dirac equation (with quadratic corrections) and the identification of the sign of the Dirac mass with the topological invariant offers a unifying framework for understanding topological phases of matter, in particular topological insulators and superconductors, as highlighted in Refs. 6 and 241. In this framework, the emergence of boundary modes can be seen as a direct consequence of the change of the sign of the Dirac mass. Since phases with opposite Dirac masses are topologically distinct, they cannot be connected by a smooth transformation unless the Dirac mass becomes zero at their shared boundary. In other words, the energy gap must close at the boundary between topologically distinct phases, allowing the topological invariant to change. This mandates the existence of localized modes closing the energy gap at the boundary or domain wall between topologically inequivalent phases. This direct correspondence between the topological invariant and the existence of boundary modes is called the bulkboundary correspondence.28\u201330 With a slight abuse of language, one may say that the inversion of the energy gap (i.e., the sign change of the Dirac mass) requires the existence of a gapless boundary.\nDue to the bulk-boundary correspondence,28\u201330 Majorana modes localize at the boundary between topologically trivial and nontrivial phases or, equivalently, at the boundary between the nontrivial phase and the vacuum. To verify this directly, let us consider a semi-infinite 1D superconductor x 0 and look for the zero-energy modes of the Hamiltonian in equation (6) localized at x \u00bc 0. The eigenfunction of such zero-energy mode must satisfy\n\u03b7@2x \u03bc \u03c4z i\u0394@x \u03c4y \u03c8(x) \u00bc 0, (11)\nwhere \u03b7 \u00bc h2=2m. Since we are looking for the localized modes, we require the wavefunction \u03c8(x) to vanish at the boundary and at infinity, i.e., \u03c8(0) \u00bc \u03c8(\u00fe1) \u00bc 0. Multiplying the equation above\nby i\u03c4y yields\n\u03b7@2x \u00fe \u03bc \u03c4x \u00fe \u0394@x \u03c8(x) \u00bc 0: (12)\nSince the above equation contains only one Pauli matrix, the wavefunction \u03c8(x) must be an eigenstate of \u03c4x with eigenvalue s \u00bc +1. Moreover, since the wavefunction must vanish at infinity, we take \u03c8(x)/ e \u03bbx with Re(\u03bb) . 0. Thus, our trial solution is either\n\u03c8(x)/ 1 1 e \u03bbx , or \u03c8(x)/ 1 1 e \u03bbx: (13)\nSubstituting into Eq. (12) yields the algebraic equations\n\u03b7\u03bb2 \u0394\u03bb\u00fe \u03bc \u00bc 0, \u03b7\u03bb2 \u00fe \u0394\u03bb\u00fe \u03bc \u00bc 0: (14)\nAssuming \u0394 . 0, only the first equation has both roots with Re(\u03bb) . 0 for \u03bc . 0, given by\n\u03bb+ \u00bc 12\u03b7 \u0394+ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi \u03942 4\u03b7\u03bc q : (15)\nHence, the boundary conditions can be fulfilled for \u03bc . 0 by a zero-energy mode with a purely real wavefunction\n\u03c8(x) \u00bc 1 Z 1 1 e \u03bb\u00fex e \u03bb x , (16)\nwith 1=Z being a normalization factor where Z2 \u00bc j1=\u03bb\u00fe \u00fe 1=\u03bb 4=(\u03bb\u00fe \u00fe \u03bb )j. This wavefunction represents a self-adjoint Majorana zero mode which decays exponentially away from the boundary x \u00bc 0, with oscillating behavior in the case where Im(\u03bb+) = 0, as shown in Fig. 1(c). The decay rate is determined by the values of j\u03bb+j, which correspond to the characteristic lengths \u03be+ \u00bc 1=j\u03bb+j. The localization length of the Majorana mode is given by the largest of these two, i.e., \u03beM \u00bc max (1=j\u03bb\u00fej, 1=j\u03bb j). The Majorana mode at the origin\nFIG. 1.

(b) For \u03bc . 0, the unit vector describes a full circle on the yz plane, having winding number W \u00bc +1 (with the sign equal to the sign of the superconducting pairing \u0394) corresponding to a topologically nontrivial phase.

For example, in the case of a nonuniform chemical potential such that \u03bc(x) + 0 for x + 0, a Majorana mode localizes at the origin x \u00bc 0. The zero-energy mode obtained is analogous to Jackiw\u2013Rebbi solitons, which are solutions of the Dirac equation localized at the interface between regions with positive and negative masses.242,243 In particular, the wavefunction in Eq.

Notice that the phase f of the superconducting pairing can always be absorbed by a unitary transformation cn ! e if=2cn. Hence, without loss of generality and for the sake of simplicity, let us assume that f \u00bc 0 hereafter. Notice that the superconducting term couples only electron states on neighboring sites: This is because spinless electrons cannot doubly occupy the same lattice site due to the Pauli exclusion principle. Notice also that the superconducting term does not conserve the number of fermions: Electrons can be added or removed from the system. However, it still conserves the fermion parity, i.e., the number of fermions modulo 2, since the superconducting term can only create or annihilate 2 fermions at a time. Of course, particle conservation is not violated at a fundamental level. The superconducting pairing term is, in fact, a mean-field description of the quasiparticle excitations of a fermionic condensate, which is the many-body groundstate described by the Bardeen\u2013Cooper\u2013Schrieffer (BCS) theory.244,245 Therefore, added and removed electrons are just coming in and out of the BCS condensate, which acts as a reservoir.\nIt is useful to rewrite the Hamiltonian in the BdG form.246 This can be achieved straightforwardly by using the fermion anticommutation relations {cn, cm} \u00bc 0 and {cyn, cm} \u00bc \u03b4nm which give cncm \u00bc (cncm cmcn)=2 and cyncm \u00bc (\u03b4nm \u00fe cyncm cmcyn)=2.

The Hamiltonian above is identical to the Hamiltonian in Eq. (17) (up to a constant term). Notice that, in the gauge f \u00bc 0, the Hamiltonian is purely real, and therefore its eigenstates can be written in terms of real wavefunctions.\nIn the BdG formalism, the fermion degrees of freedom are doubled. Each fermionic \u201cparticle\u201d state (with creation operator cy) is mirrored by a fermionic \u201chole\u201d state (with creation operator ~cy \u00bc c). Indeed, the particle creation operator coincides with the hole annihilation operator. In other words, creating a particle with energy E is equivalent to annihilating a hole with energy E. The groundstate of the BdG Hamiltonian is the state where all quasiparticle hole states are occupied. On the other hand, the excited states coincide with the creation of a particle with energy E . 0, or equivalently the annihilation of a hole with energy E , 0. This particle\u2013hole symmetry can be formally described as an antiunitary symmetry that anticommutes with the Hamiltonian, as I will discuss in Sec. II D.\nThe Kitaev model in Eq. (17) corresponds to the discrete version of the continuum Hamiltonian of a spinless topological superconductor in Eq. (6), obtained via Eq. (A1) with t \u00bc \u03b7=a2 \u00bc h2=2ma2 the hopping parameter, and by redefining the superconducting pairing ~\u0394 \u00bc \u0394=2a and rescaling the chemical potential ~\u03bc \u00bc \u03bc 2t (see Appendix A)."

The continuum Hamiltonian in Eq. (7) and its discrete counterpart in Eq. (21) are approximately equivalent at small momenta k 0, as one can see by expanding Eq. (21) at the second order in k. However, the energy dispersion has a finite energy width in the discrete cases, whereas it is unbounded in the continuum case, being parabolic / k2 [see Eq. (8)]. In practice, this difference does not have any physical consequence as long as one is interested in the low-energy properties of the model.\nFigure 2 shows the energy dispersion Ek of superconducting electrons and the bare electron dispersion \u03b5k for different choices of the chemical potential \u03bc. The bare electron dispersion is gapped for j\u03bcj . 2t [see Figs. 2(a) and 2(f )], whereas it is gapless for j\u03bcj , 2t with a Fermi momentum kF determined by 2t cos (kFa) \u00bc \u03bc [see Figs. 2(c) and 2(d)].

As mentioned, this is a direct consequence of the odd-parity symmetry of the superconducting pairing (i.e., \u0394k \u00bc \u0394 k), which can vanish only at k \u00bc 0 and k \u00bc +\u03c0. Thus, the particle\u2013hole gap closes only if the bare electron dispersion \u03b5k vanishes altogether, which is indeed what happens for \u03bc \u00bc 2t and \u03bc \u00bc 2t where \u03b5k \u00bc 0, respectively, at k \u00bc 0 and k \u00bc +\u03c0.

This transformation defines a new set of fermion operators, i.e., the Bogoliubov quasiparticles dk \u00bc ukck \u00fe vkcy k, mixing creation and annihilation operators (particle and hole states) with opposite momenta. In the gauge f \u00bc 0, the two Bogoliubov coefficients can be chosen to be real numbers, such that the eigenstates\nare described by real wavefunctions. The groundstate of the Hamiltonian is the vacuum of the Bogoliubov quasiparticles, i.e., the state 0j i annihilated by all fermion operators dk, i.e., dk 0j i \u00bc 0 for all momenta k. The excitations of the system are the states dyk 0j i, which can be interpreted equivalently as the creation of a particle with energy Ek, or the annihilation of a hole with energy Ek. Creating a state with positive energy (particle) is equivalent to annihilating a state with negative energy (hole).\nFigure 3 shows the phase space of the Kitaev model. The gapless points \u03bc \u00bc +2t separate two qualitatively different regimes, the so-called strong-pairing (j\u03bcj . 2t) and weak-pairing (j\u03bcj , 2t) phases, following the definition of Read and Green.18 In the\nFIG. 2.

Gapped phases that can be connected by a continuous transformation without closing the energy gap and without breaking any symmetry are topologically equivalent. Different equivalence classes within the same symmetry class are characterized by a topological invariant, which is an integer number: the value of the topological invariant is not affected by small perturbations but can change only in correspondence to a\nquantum phase transition, e.g., when the particle\u2013hole gap of the superconductor closes and reopens again. In homogeneous systems with translational invariance, the topological invariant labels the different (inequivalent) homotopy classes partitioning all possible mappings between the d-dimensional Brillouin zone and the Hamiltonian H(k). The relevant symmetries which classify topological phases of matter are the antiunitary symmetries C and T defined by antiunitary operators that anticommute and commute with the Hamiltonian, respectively, and the unitary symmetry defined by their composition S \u00bc T C. The C symmetry coincides with the particle\u2013hole symmetry of the superconducting condensate, whereas the T symmetry usually coincides (but does not need to) with the ordinary time-reversal symmetry.\nIn a superconductor, each fermionic \u201cparticle\u201d (with creation operator cy) is mirrored by a fermionic \u201chole\u201d (with creation operator ~cy \u00bc c), as already mentioned.

Indeed, the p-wave pairing does not break time-reversal and chiral symmetries in 1D. This is because, contrarily to the case of 2D p-wave superconductors, the p-wave pairing term in 1D can be made real with a unitary phase rotation.254,255 Specifically, the phase f of the superconducting pairing can always be absorbed by a unitary rotation in 1D systems, and one can consider f \u00bc 0 without loss of generality.\nJ.

Unbroken time-reversal symmetry mandates that Hamiltonians in class BDI can be written in terms of only two out of three Pauli matrices, since Eq. (34) mandates {H(k), \u03c4x} \u00bc 0. Consequently, these Hamiltonians are real, or can be cast as real Hamiltonians up to a unitary transformation. In 1D, this class allows topologically nontrivial phases corresponding to a topological invariant that can take in principle all integer values \u03bd [ Z. On the other hand, Hamiltonians with broken time-reversal and chiral symmetries and unbroken particle\u2013hole symmetry with C2 \u00bc 1 belong to the symmetry class D.

In general, one is interested in the effects of perturbations on the Majorana modes, described by extra terms in the Hamiltonian.

(31) in terms of the vector h(k)\u00bc [Re(\u0394k), Im(\u0394k), \u03b5k]. Particle\u2013 hole symmetry mandates hy(k)\u00bc hy( k) and hz(k)\u00bc hz( k), while chiral symmetry mandates hx(k)\u00bcRe(\u0394k)\u00bc 0 [see Eqs. (33) and (34)].

The winding number counts the total number of turns that the vector h(k) (or equivalently, the unit vector u(k)) makes around the origin in the yz plane as k varies in the Brillouin zone k [ [0, 2\u03c0], with positive or negative signs for anticlockwise or clockwise directions. This number can only change when the trajectory of the vector h(k) passes through the origin, i.e., when the particle\u2013hole gap closes.\nFor the Kitaev model in Eq. (21) in the gauge f \u00bc 0, the vector h(k) \u00bc [0, 2\u0394 sin (ka), \u03bc 2t cos (ka)] and the corresponding unit vector u(k) \u00bc h(k)=Ek draw a closed loop in the yz plane when k runs from 0 to 2\u03c0, as shown in Fig. 4.

For j\u03bcj , 2t instead, the closed loop does encircle the origin, as shown in Fig. 4(c). The direction of the winding depends on the sign of the superconducting parameter \u0394, being anticlockwise for \u0394 . 0, which gives W \u00bc 1, and clockwise for \u0394 , 0, which gives W \u00bc 1. The transition between the two distinct topological phases with W \u00bc 0 and W \u00bc +1 coincides with the closing of the particle\u2013hole gap at \u03bc \u00bc +2t, as shown in Fig. 4(b).

(17), the Z2 topological invariant characterizing topological phases in class D in 1D is an integer that admits only two possible values \u03bd \u00bc 0, 1, and such that its value can only change when the particle\u2013hole gap closes. Notice that if the time-reversal symmetry is broken, the unit vector u(k) is not constrained anymore on the plane yz since on may have hx(k) = 0, and thus its winding number is not well-defined. However, even in this case, the timereversal and chiral symmetry in Eq. (34) are still unbroken for the two time-reversal symmetric momenta k \u00bc 0 and \u03c0, as one can verify since \u03940 \u00bc \u0394\u03c0 \u00bc 0 due to the particle\u2013hole symmetry. This mandates hx(k) \u00bc hy(k) \u00bc 0 with h(k) \u00bc [0, 0, \u03b5k] for k \u00bc 0, \u03c0. Consequently, the unit vector u(k) points to the positive hz(k) . 0 or negative hz(k) , 0 direction on the z axis for k \u00bc 0, \u03c0. In this case, one can define the Z2 topological invariant as\n( 1)\u03bd \u00bc sgn hz(0)hz(\u03c0)\u00f0 \u00de: (37)\nIf \u03bd \u00bc 0, the unit vector u(k) has the same direction for k \u00bc 0, \u03c0, and will follow a closed trajectory starting from the north (or south) pole when k \u00bc \u03c0, passing again for the same pole when k \u00bc 0, and returning back again when k \u00bc \u03c0. If \u03bd \u00bc 1, the unit vector u(k) has opposite directions for k \u00bc 0, \u03c0, and will start from the north (or\nsouth) pole when k \u00bc \u03c0, passing through the opposite pole when k \u00bc 0, and returning back when k \u00bc \u03c0. Notice that the signs of hz(0) and hz(\u03c0) are both changed by unitary transformations exchanging particle and hole operators. However, the sign of the product hz(0)hz(\u03c0) can change only by closing the particle\u2013hole gap at either k \u00bc 0 or \u03c0. Thus, trajectories with hz(0)hz(\u03c0) . 0 are topologically distinct from trajectories with hz(0)hz(\u03c0) , 0.\nIntuitively, the Z2 invariant in Eq. (37) is defined by assigning a parity to the Hamiltonian density H(k) at time-reversal momenta k \u00bc 0, \u03c0. This parity coincides with the sign of the component hz(k) of the vector h(k). However, there is another, more general way to assign a parity to the Hamiltonian. First, notice that the determinant of the Hamiltonian density H(k) at time-reversal momenta k \u00bc 0, \u03c0 is the square of the hz(k) component up to a minus sign, i.e., det(H(k)) \u00bc hz(k)2. Then, let us recall that the determinant of an antisymmetric matrix is the square of its pfaffian (see Appendix B). The matrix H(k) is not antisymmetric, but the matrix H(k)S is real and antisymmetric at k \u00bc 0, \u03c0 due to particle\u2013 hole symmetry, and satisfies det(H(k)S) \u00bc det(H(k)). Indeed, one can verify directly that hz(k) \u00bc pf(H(k)S) at the time-reversal momenta k \u00bc 0, \u03c0. Thus, the sign of the pfaffian of the matrix H(k)S coincides with the sign of hz(k) at the time-reversal momenta k \u00bc 0, \u03c0, and therefore, the Z2 topological invariant can be defined as24,255,256\n( 1)\u03bd \u00bc sgn pf(H(0)S)pf (H(\u03c0)S) , (38)\nwith S \u00bc \u03c4x , where pf(A) denotes the pfaffian of the antisymmetric matrix A (see Appendix B). The matrix H(k)\u03c4x is real and antisymmetric at the time-reversal symmetry points k \u00bc 0, \u03c0. This is a direct consequence of particle\u2013hole symmetry since (H(k)KC)T \u00bc CKH*(k) \u00bc CH( k)K \u00bc H( k)CK gives (H(k)\u03c4x)\nT \u00bc H(k)\u03c4x for k \u00bc 0, \u03c0. The topological invariant defined in Eqs. (37) and (38) is a quantity that admits only two possible values and such that its value changes only if the particle\u2013hole gap closes. Indeed, due to the symmetry of the p-wave pairing term, the particle-hole gap of a spinless superconductor may close only at the time-reversal symmetry points k \u00bc 0, \u03c0, with the concurrent change of the topological invariant. The trivial \u03bd \u00bc 0 and nontrivial \u03bd \u00bc 1 phases correspond to the cases where the pfaffian pf(H(k)S) has the same or opposite signs at the two time-reversal symmetry momenta k \u00bc 0, \u03c0. The change of the Z2 invariant from trivial (\u03bd \u00bc 0) to nontrivial (\u03bd \u00bc 1) coincides with the inversion of the particle-hole gap and with the energy level crossing at k \u00bc 0, \u03c0.\nThe two definitions of the Z2 invariant in Eqs. (37) and (38) coincide since hz(k) \u00bc pf(H(k)S). However, the pfaffian formula in Eq. (38) can be straightforwardly applied to more general cases, such as multiband or quasi-1D cases,79,257 and generalized to the case of spinful electrons (see Sec. IV E). Moreover, the pfaffian Z2 invariant can be rewritten in real space via a Fourier transform and generalized to cases where the translational symmetry is broken.256 In the case of unbroken time-reversal symmetry (class BDI), the Z2 invariant corresponds to the parity of the Z invariant,255 i.e., \u03bd ; Wmod 2.\nJ.

Hence, there is one Majorana mode at each end of a 1D system in the topologically nontrivial phase \u03bd \u00bc 1, and no Majorana modes in the topologically trivial phase \u03bd \u00bc 0. Moreover, since the topological invariant can change only when the gap closes, the existence of Majorana modes is robust against small perturbations which do not close the gap.\nFor the Kitaev model in Eq.

Notice that the two topological phases with winding numbers W \u00bc +1 (corresponding to \u0394 . 0 and \u0394 , 0) become equivalent in class D since they can be connected by smoothly rotating the phase of the superconducting pairing \u0394eif and correspond to the same topological phase with \u03bd \u00bc 1. Notice also that unitary rotations of the superconducting phase break time-reversal symmetry and are thus not allowed in class BDI.\nIt is worth mentioning that, by considering systems with unbroken time-reversal symmetry (class BDI) and longer-range couplings,254,258\u2013260 e.g., where both the hopping and superconducting pairing terms extend to the nearest and next nearest neighbors, one can realize topologically nontrivial phases with higher winding numbers j\u03bdj . 1.

Let us consider the case where only the Majorana modes on the same lattice sites are coupled, which is realized for \u0394 \u00bc t \u00bc 0 and \u03bc = 0, which yields\nH \u00bc 1 2 XN n\u00bc1 \u03bc(1\u00fe i\u03b3A,n\u03b3B,n) \u00bc XN n\u00bc1 \u03bccyncn: (45)\nIn this case, the energy spectrum has a bulk gap \u0394E \u00bc j\u03bcj with quasiparticle excitations described by the operators cyn corresponding to electrons localized on the same lattice site or, alternatively, to the superpositions of two Majorana operators localized on the same lattice site, as illustrated in Fig. 5(a). This gapped phase is topologically trivial, having j\u03bcj . 2t, as seen in Sec.

This phase is topologically nontrivial, having j\u03bcj , 2t, as seen in Sec. II D.\nNotice that we started with a lattice of N fermionic operators cn and ended up with N 1 single-particle states described by the operators dn, i.e., one less than the number of lattice sites. Where is the missing fermionic mode? The answer has to be sought in the Majorana operators \u03b3A,1 and \u03b3B,N , which are also missing from the Hamiltonian in Eq. (47). These \u201cdangling\u201d Majorana modes must commute with the Hamiltonian [H, \u03b3A,1] \u00bc [H, \u03b3B,N ] \u00bc 0 and can be combined to form an additional fermionic operator\ndN \u00bc 12 (\u03b3B,N i\u03b3A,1), (48)\nwhich satisfies the usual fermion anticommutation relations {dN , dN } \u00bc 0 and {dN , dyN } \u00bc 1.\nThe state defined in the equation above is the Majorana bound state: It is a nonlocal single-particle fermion which is the superposition of two Majorana end modes localized at the two opposite ends of the chain, as shown in Fig. 5(b). The Majorana bound state does not appear in the Hamiltonian and thus has zero energy. However, there is already one state with zero energy, i.e., the groundstate given by the vacuum of the quasiparticle excitations 0j i, i.e., the state annihilated by any fermionic operator dn 0j i \u00bc 0 for n \u00bc 1, . . . , N 1. It is now natural to define a number operator for the Majorana bound state as\nnM \u00bc nN \u00bc dyNdN \u00bc 1 2 (1\u00fe i\u03b3A,1\u03b3B,N ): (49)\nThe two groundstates are labeled by a different occupation number of the Majorana bound state (i.e., by the eigenvalue of the number operator). The vacuum state 0j i and the state 1j i have eigenvalues nM \u00bc 0 and 1, respectively,\nnM 0j i \u00bc 0, nM 1j i \u00bc 1j i: (50)\nMoreover, the two degenerate groundstates have a different fermion number F \u00bcPn cyncn and different fermion parity,24 which is defined by\nP \u00bc ( 1)F \u00bc Y n (1 2cyncn) \u00bc Y n ( i\u03b3A,n\u03b3B,n)\n\u00bc Y n (1 2dyndn), (51)\nwith PPy \u00bc P2 \u00bc 1. Although the superconducting pairing term in the BCS Hamiltonian does not conserve the total number of fermions, the fermion parity, i.e., the number of fermions modulo 2, is conserved. Thus, the parity operator commutes with the Hamiltonian, and thus any eigenstate has a well-defined fermion parity given by the eigenvalues p \u00bc +1 of the parity operator. Since creating or annihilating a fermion correspond to changing the fermion parity, the two degenerate groundstates 0j i and 1j i have different fermion parity. These groundstates are the vacuum of the Bogoliubov quasiparticles 0j i and the nonlocal single-particle state 1j i, i.e., the Majorana bound state, which is the superposition of two Majorana end modes localized at the opposite ends of the chain. The presence of two degenerate groundstates with opposite fermion parity is an example of quantum mechanical supersymmetry, i.e., the symmetry between bosonic and fermionic many-body states corresponding to even and odd fermion parities.141,261\u2013263"

More generally, for spatially dependent chemical potentials \u03bcn, Majorana modes localize at the boundary between the topologically trivial j\u03bcnj . 2t and nontrivial phases j\u03bcnj , 2t.\nThe localized Majorana zero modes can be found by solving the equation of motion and imposing open boundary conditions,24,31 analogously to the continuous case described in Sec.

This is a direct consequence of the fact that the Hamiltonian in Eq. (18) is purely real for f \u00bc 0.\nThe limiting case \u03bc2 \u00bc 4(t2 \u03942) can be obtained as the asymptotic limit of Eqs.

In particular, for \u03bc \u00bc 0 and \u0394 \u00bc t, one recovers the case described by the Majorana chain regime in the nontrivial phase, with Majorana nodes perfectly localized at the two opposite lattice sites of the chain, as in Eq. (47). Finally, at the topological phase transition \u03bc \u00bc +2t, which yields jz j \u00bc 1 and jz\u00fej \u00bc 1, respectively, the zero-energy modes are not localized anymore and become extended along the whole chain. Physically, this corresponds to the fusion of the two Majorana end modes into a single fermionic mode with a finite energy.\nIn terms of the Majorana operators, the zero-energy Majorana end modes in Eq. (52) can be written as\n\u03b3A \u00bc X n wn\u03b3A,n, \u03b3B \u00bc X n wN\u00fe1 n\u03b3B,n, (55)\nOne can verify that \u03b3A and \u03b3B are Majorana operators since they are self-adjoint, idempotent operators satisfying the fermionic anticommutation rules, as in Eq. (2). The superposition of these two\nMajorana modes forms a fermionic single-particle state, the Majorana bound state, given by\ndM \u00bc 12 \u03b3B i\u03b3A\u00f0 \u00de, (56)\nwhich again satisfies the usual fermionic anticommutation relations {dM, dM} \u00bc 0 and {dM, dyM} \u00bc 1. The equation above generalizes Eq. (48) to the case where the Majorana modes are not perfectly localized on the opposite lattice sites of the chain but have a finite localization length.\nFigure 6 shows the topological phase transition and the Majorana bound state calculated for j\u03bcj , 2t. The topological phase transition at \u03bc \u00bc 2t separates the trivial phase from the nontrivial phase with Majorana end modes. As shown in Fig. 6(b), the Majorana modes \u03b3A and \u03b3B localize, respectively, at the left and right ends of the chain and decay exponentially toward the center as j\u03c8nj/ e n=\u03beM , with the localization length \u03beM given by\n\u03beM \u00bc max 1 j log jz\u00fek , 1 j log jz k : (57)\nIn the Majorana chain regime \u0394 \u00bc t, one has z\u00fe \u00bc 0 or z \u00bc 0, which correspond to perfectly localized Majorana end modes with \u03beM \u00bc 0.\nNotice that the Majorana bound state in Eq. (56) is only an approximate eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, which becomes exact only in the infinite-size limit N ! 1. In fact, the wavefunctions in Eq. (52) satisfy the boundary conditions \u03c80 \u00bc \u03c8N\u00fe1 \u00bc 0 only up to exponentially small terms for a generic choice of the parameters: The wavefunctions of \u03b3A and \u03b3B evaluated at n \u00bc N \u00fe 1 and n \u00bc 0 do not vanish, being / e (N\u00fe1)=\u03beM . Indeed, the energy of the Majorana bound state in a finite chain decays exponentially as EM / e N=\u03beM with damped oscillations264\u2013266 due to the hybridization of the two Majorana modes at the opposite ends of the chain (see Refs. 265 and 266). The hybridization and energy splitting of the Majorana bound state can be described by an effective Hamiltonian24\nHeff \u00bc i2EM\u03b3A\u03b3B \u00bc EM nM 1 2 , (58)\nwhere nM \u00bc dyMdM is the number operator of the Majorana bound state defined in Eq. (56). The energy splitting EM between the Majorana bound state and the vacuum groundstate is zero in the limit of infinite system size. The crucial point is that the energy splitting scales exponentially with the linear dimension. Consequently, the energy splitting becomes negligible when the linear dimension is larger than the localization length N \u03beM. As mentioned in the introduction, this exponential scaling is a distinctive feature of topologically nontrivial states of matter. Analogously, in the quantum Hall effect,33\u201335 the conductance is exactly quantized up to exponentially small corrections in the linear dimensions.36,37 In the presence of small perturbations, e.g., weak disorder, the energy splitting remains exponentially small in the system size and smaller than the particle\u2013hole gap EM \u0394E, as long as the particle\u2013hole gap remains open.

            "text": "A general statement in quantum mechanics is that the manybody wavefunction describing a collection of identical particles must have a well-defined symmetry under the exchange or permutation of particles. In particular, bosons are symmetric under exchange, whereas fermions are antisymmetric. The exchange symmetry determines the particle statistics and is related to the particle spin by the spin-statistics theorem. Moreover, permutations of fermions or bosons are abelian (i.e., commutative) operations, in the sense that the outcome of a series of successive permutations does\nnot depend on the order in which these permutations are performed. However, these statements hold true only for pointlike particles living in our ordinary 3D world.\nIn a 2D world, or in a system that is effectively 2D, such as 2D topological superconductors, quasiparticle excitations may have an exchange statistics that differ from those of fermions or bosons.41,236,273 To understand the difference between the 3D and 2D cases, consider two consecutive adiabatic exchanges of two identical pointlike particles. This double exchange U2 can be realized by moving one particle around the other on a closed path that does not intersect the second particle. In 3D, this closed path can be continuously deformed to a point, i.e., to the case where the particle does not move at all: The double exchange is topologically equivalent to no exchange and must coincide with the identity U2 \u00bc 1. This leaves only two possibilities, i.e., U \u00bc 1 and U \u00bc 1 realized, respectively, by bosons and fermions. The exchange of identical bosons or fermions is equivalent to multiplying the manybody state by a phase factor equal to +1, respectively. In 2D, however, the closed path cannot be continuously deformed to a point without intersecting the second particle. Therefore, the unitary exchange U is not constrained anymore as in the previous case, and more possibilities arise: Pointlike particles in 2D may be bosons, fermions, as well as abelian or nonabelian anyons.43,274,275 The exchange of two abelian anyons is equivalent to the multiplication of the many-body state by a phase factor eif, where f is any rational multiple of 2\u03c0. On the other hand, the exchange of nonabelian anyons corresponds to a multiplication of the many-body state by a unitary matrix U. This necessarily requires the presence of a degenerate many-body groundstate where the unitary matrix U describes unitary evolutions within the groundstate manifold. Since matrix multiplication is nonabelian (i.e., noncommutative), the outcome of two successive exchange operations depends on the order in which the operations are performed.18,38,40,43,44 Exchange operations of nonabelian anyons are described by braid groups.41 Contrarily to ordinary electronic excitations in condensed matter, Majorana modes bounded to the vortex cores of a topological superconductor exhibit nonabelian exchange statistics.18,38,45 The nonabelian exchange statistics is a general property of Majorana modes which holds true even in 3D, as shown in Ref. 276. Essentially, this is due to the fact that the simple argument discussed before, which rules out the possibility of nonabelian exchange of pointlike particles in 3D, breaks down in the case of Majorana modes due to the intrinsic spatial orientation corresponding to the texture of the superconducting order parameter.276\u2013278\nIn 1D, however, there is a catch: there is simply no room in 1D to exchange the position of two identical particles moving one around the other via a continuous transformation. Hence, it is impossible to meaningfully define exchange operations since there is no way to exchange the positions of two Majorana modes living at the two opposite ends of a quantum wire without overlapping their wavefunctions and thus splitting their energy. This is essentially for the same reason why there is no way for two trains to pass each other when moving in opposite directions on the same track or exchange the position of the head and the tail of a train using one single track. However, trains avoid collisions by traveling on 1D tracks embedded into 2D (or even 3D) networks. Therefore, it is possible to assemble a collection of 1D wires into a network that\nJ. Appl.

The nonabelian nature of the exchange operations of Majorana modes, regardless of spatial dimensions, follows directly from fermion-parity conservation.14,279,280 Let us consider the adiabatic exchange U of two zero-energy Majorana modes \u03b31 and \u03b32. In the presence of a finite energy gap and in the adiabatic limit, these two modes remain Majorana modes during unitary evolutions \u03b3n \u00bc U\u03b3mUy. Since the energy spectra of topological superconductors are gapped and fermion-parity is conserved, the unitary evolution U of the many-body state of the two Majorana modes is constrained within the groundstate manifold with fixed fermion-parity. This mandates that the only possible exchange process is given by\nU\u03b31U y \u00bc \u03c72\u03b32, U\u03b32Uy \u00bc \u03c71\u03b31, (59)\nwhere \u03c71 and \u03c72 are phase factors.

This gives two possibilities, either \u03c7 \u00bc \u03c72 \u00bc \u03c71 \u00bc 1 or 1. The choice between \u03c7 \u00bc 1 and \u03c7 \u00bc 1 is determined by the Hamiltonian governing the unitary evolution.279\nOne can generalize the exchange operation to a system containing several Majorana end modes. The exchange of two Majorana end modes \u03b3n and \u03b3m is described by\n\u03b3n ! \u03c7\u03b3m, (61a)\n\u03b3m ! \u00fe\u03c7\u03b3n, (61b)\nwith \u03c7 \u00bc +1 depending on the details of the Hamiltonian. For \u03c7 \u00bc 1, this exchange corresponds to the unitary transformation \u03b3p !

The second equality in the equation above is a special case of the identity exp (\u03b1\u03b3n\u03b3m) \u00bc cos \u03b1 \u00fe sin \u03b1 \u03b3n\u03b3m, which can be obtained by expanding the exponentiation as a Taylor series and using the identity (\u03b3n\u03b3m) 2 \u00bc 1. Braids can be\nrepresented in a diagrammatic form, as illustrated in Fig. 7. The inverse transformation is the braid operator Uynm \u00bc Umn given by\nUmn \u00bc 1ffiffi 2 p 1 \u03b3n\u03b3m\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc exp \u03c0 4 \u03b3n\u03b3m , (63)\nwhich corresponds to the exchange in Eq. (61) with \u03c7 \u00bc 1. Hence, there are two inequivalent ways of braiding the two Majorana modes Umn = Unm. Intuitively, braid operations are a generalization of permutations to the case where the exchange of two objects can be performed in several inequivalent ways. Figure 7(a) represents the braid operator U12 and its inverse U21 \u00bc Uy12. Notice that braiding two Majorana modes \u03b3n and \u03b3m is not equivalent to a simple relabeling of their indices \u03b3n $ \u03b3m. In fact, by applying two times the unitary transformation in Eq. (62), one does not recover the initial configuration since one can immediately verify that U2nm \u00bc \u03b3n\u03b3m, which gives\n\u03b3n ! \u03b3m ! \u03b3n, (64a)\n\u03b3m ! \u00fe\u03b3n ! \u03b3m: (64b)\nFor a given set of 2N Majorana modes, the braid operators on neighboring Majorana modes Un,n\u00fe1 generate all braid operators Unm, their inverses Umn, and all their possible combinations, including the identity operator 1. In other words, the braid operators Un,n\u00fe1 are the generators of the unitary group describing all unitary evolutions of the 2N Majorana modes.\nThe braiding of Majorana modes is nonabelian, i.e., braid operators do not commute: The result of the composition of two or more braids may depend on the order they are performed. Braid operators commute with their inverse, i.e., [Unm, Umn] \u00bc 0. Also, braids of a pair of Majorana modes \u03b3n, \u03b3m and another pair and \u03b3p, \u03b3q (with n, m, p, and q all distinct) commute [Unm, Upq] \u00bc 0. However, braiding two Majorana modes \u03b3n and \u03b3m, and then braiding one of them with a third one \u03b3p, is not equivalent to the reverse process. In particular, one can verify that\n[Unm, Ump] \u00bc \u03b3n\u03b3p, (65)\nwith n, m, and p all distinct. This equation expresses the fact that the exchange statistics of Majorana modes is nonabelian (noncommutative): The final outcome depends on the order in which the braiding operations are performed, i.e., UnmUmp = UmpUnm. The operations U12 and U23 and their combinations U23U12 and U12U23 are shown diagrammatically in Fig. 7(b).

The key idea is to manipulate the chemical potential \u03bc (or another microscopic parameter) in order to slowly shift the boundaries of the trivial and nontrivial regions and, by doing that, adiabatically move the Majorana modes within the junction. Let us go through the process illustrated in Fig. 8(a) from left to right. We start from a configuration where one segment of the left branch is in the nontrivial phase j\u03bcj , 2t, and the rest of the junction is trivial j\u03bcj . 2t, with two Majorana modes \u03b31 and \u03b32 localized at the boundaries of the nontrivial segment of the left branch. We then slowly move the domain walls between the trivial and nontrivial phases, such that the two Majorana modes pass (one after the other) through the center of the junction to reach the lower branch. Likewise, the two Majorana modes may pass again through the center of the junction to reach the right branch and once again to the left branch. By doing so, the positions of the two Majorana modes \u03b31 and \u03b32 are exchanged\nfollowing a clockwise path on the 2D plane of the trijunction. This corresponds to the adiabatic exchange described by the braid operator U12 or U21 in Eqs. (62) and (63), depending on the Hamiltonian describing the trijunction, but not on the details of the exchange process.279 The reverse process (from right to left), where the Majorana modes are exchanged following an anticlockwise path on the 2D plane, corresponds to the inverse braiding operator, being either U 112 \u00bc U21 or U 121 \u00bc U12. Braiding protocols can be implemented by moving the domain walls between trivial and nontrivial phases (where Majorana modes localize) by tuning the chemical potential, superconducting pairing, or other parameters,42,279,280,286,287 in particular using arrays of electric gates,42,288,289 nanomagnets,141,290 tunable spin-valves,291 magnetic tunnel junctions,292,293 or magnetic stripes,65 or supercurrents.286\nPerhaps counterintuitively, braiding can also be performed by exchanging Majorana modes without physically moving them.284,285,294\u2013296 Let us consider a trijunction where all three branches are in the nontrivial phase.285 To understand where Majorana modes localize, imagine decoupling the three branches of the trijunction: This results in three separated segments in the nontrivial phase, arranged as in Fig. 8(b), with Majorana modes localized on the inner and outer ends. When the coupling between these three segments is restored to form the trijunction, the hybridization of the three inner Majorana modes forms a fermion at finite energy and a remaining unpaired Majorana mode at zero energy.42 Hence, three Majorana zero-energy modes \u03b3n with n \u00bc 1, 2, 3 are localized on the outer ends of the trijunction, and another one \u03b30 at the center.42,285 If the length L of the branches is finite, this\nFIG. 7.

These couplings can be controlled by changing the lengths of the branches or the Majorana localization lengths by varying, e.g., the chemical potential or other parameters. An essential requirement is that these coupling can be effectively turned off for L=\u03beM ! 1 up to exponentially small corrections. To move the Majorana modes on the trijunction, consider the process illustrated in Fig. 8(c). We start with a configuration where w1 \u00bc w2 \u00bc 0 and w3 . 0, where the Majorana modes \u03b31 and \u03b32 in the upper left and right branches are fully decoupled and have zero energy, while the other two modes are hybridized (with a finite energy splitting). Next, we increase the coupling w2 to a finite value, leaving the mode \u03b31 unaffected\n(w1 \u00bc 0). One can verify that in this configuration, there is a linear combination of the Majorana modes on the right and lower branches which commutes with the Hamiltonian and thus remains pinned at zero energy for all w2, w3 . 0. Therefore the mode \u03b32 becomes a superposition of the two Majorana modes on the right and lower branches. Then, we reduce the coupling w3 to zero, such that w1 \u00bc w3 \u00bc 0 and w2 . 0. By doing this, the mode \u03b32 localizes on the lower branch. In this configuration, the modes \u03b31 and \u03b32 become again fully decoupled zero-energy Majorana modes. This process amounts to moving the Majorana mode \u03b32 from the right branch to the lower branch. The exchange of the two Majorana modes \u03b31 and \u03b32 is then realized by three consecutive processes, shown in Fig. 8(d). First, the mode \u03b32 is moved from the right branch to the lower branch, then \u03b31 from the left to the right branch, and finally, \u03b32 from the lower branch to the left branch. The whole process amounts to exchanging the two Majorana modes \u03b31 and \u03b32 following a clockwise path. In the adiabatic limit, one can show that this process is described by the unitary operator U12 \u00bc exp( \u03c04 \u03b31\u03b32).284 This braiding protocol exchanges Majorana modes in parameter space without physically\nFIG. 8.

The quantum gates are implemented by unitary transformations on qubits composed of different combinations of braid operators. Consider a network of 2N localized Majorana modes \u03b3 i which commute with the Hamiltonian. These Majorana modes can be combined into pairs corresponding to a set of N nonlocal fermionic operators\ndi \u00bc 12 (\u03b32i 1 \u00fe i\u03b32i), (68)\nwhere \u03b32i 1 and \u03b32i are pairs of neighboring Majorana modes, separated either by a trivial or a nontrivial region. Notice that the way one combines Majorana modes into pairs is an arbitrary choice, with different choices being unitary equivalent and corresponding to unitary rotations of the basis of fermionic operators. The state of the system is fully described by the set of number operators ni \u00bc dyi di of each fermionic mode. The creation or annihilation of such fermionic modes does not change the total energy since the fermionic operators commute with the Hamiltonian, but it changes the fermion parity\nP \u00bc ( 1)F \u00bc YN i\u00bc1 (1 2dyi di) \u00bc YN i\u00bc1 ( i\u03b32i 1\u03b32i), (69)\nwhere F \u00bcPi ni is the fermion number [cf. Eq. (51)]. Thus, every fermionic mode can be either occupied ni \u00bc 1 or empty ni \u00bc 0, giving two degenerate states for each pair of Majorana modes. Consequently, the groundstate manifold has degeneracy 2N : The collection of these degenerate groundstates is spanned by the linear combination of all possible eigenstates n1; n2; . . . ; nNj i labeled by the occupation numbers ni of the fermionic modes. Notice that the groundstate manifold includes states with both even and odd fermion parities. Since braid operations do not break parity\nconservation, they do not mix the even and odd parity sectors. Hence, for a set of 2N Majorana modes, the dimension of the groundstate manifold with fixed fermion parity is 2N 1. Quantum gates correspond to braid operations Unm acting on this manifold, which is separated from higher-energy quasiparticle excitations by the particle\u2013hole gap.

For a set of 2N Majorana modes, the groundstate manifold with fixed fermion parity has dimension 2N 1 and corresponds to N 1 qubits. The set of all quantum gates acting on these N 1 qubits coincides with the unitary group U(2N 1). A single qubit (2N \u00bc 4 Majorana modes) corresponds to a two-level quantum system, and quantum gates acting on it correspond to the unitary group U(2). Each single-qubit quantum gate U [ U(2) can be represented as rotations on the Bloch sphere, which is the unit sphere spanned by the eigenstates 0j i and 1j i of the qubit, which corresponds to the many-body states with fixed fermion parity, e.g., 0j i \u00bc 00j i and 1j i \u00bc 11j i.

Some notable examples of single-qubit gates are the Pauli gates, given by the three Pauli matrices acting on a single qubit, i.e.,\nX \u00bc 1 1 , Y \u00bc i i , Z \u00bc 1 1 : (73)\nThe Pauli-X gate is also called the NOT gate since it is the quantum version of the logic NOT gate in classical computers. The Pauli gates X, Y, and Z perform rotations by \u03c0 around the x, y, and z axes of the Bloch sphere. Moreover, the square roots of the Pauli gatesffiffiffi X p , ffiffiffi Y p , and ffiffiffi Z p perform rotations by \u03c0=2 around the x, y, and z axes of the Bloch sphere, as shown in Fig. 9. Other examples of single-qubit gates are the so-called phase-shift gates\nP(f) \u00bc 1 eif , (74)\nwhich include the Pauli-Z gate as a special case, as well as the S and T gates\nZ \u00bc P(\u03c0) \u00bc 1 1 , (75a)\nS \u00bc P \u03c0 2 \u00bc\nffiffiffi Z p \u00bc 1\ni\n, (75b)\nT \u00bc P \u03c0 4 \u00bc\nffiffi S p \u00bc 4 ffiffiffi Z p \u00bc 1\nei\u03c0/4\n, (75c)\nwhere T2 \u00bc S and S2 \u00bc Z. The Z, S, and T gates above correspond, respectively, to rotations by \u03c0, \u03c0=2, and \u03c0=4 around the z axis of the Bloch sphere, as shown in Fig. 9. Another single-qubit gate is the Hadamard gate\nH \u00bc 1ffi i\np X ffiffiffi Y p \u00bc 1ffiffi\n2 p X \u00fe Z\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 1ffiffi 2 p 1 1 1 1 , (76)\nwith H2 \u00bc 1. The Hadamard gate corresponds to a \u03c0=2 rotation around the y axis followed by a \u03c0 rotation around the x axis, as shown in Fig. 9. Combinations of the S gate and the Hadamard H gate generate the Pauli gates X, Y, and Z up to a phase, as well as their square roots ffiffiffi X\np \u00bc HSH, ffiffiffiYp \u00bc ffiip XH, and ffiffiffiZp \u00bc S. Hence, the S gate and the Hadamard H gate generate all rotations around the three axes of the Bloch sphere by an angle multiple of \u03c0=2. A remarkable result is that only by adding rotations of \u03c0=4 around a single axis (e.g., using the T gate) one can generate all possible rotations (by arbitrary angles around arbitrary axes) up to arbitrary precision. Indeed, all unitary transformations on a single qubit can be performed using only the Hadamard H gate and the T gate: For any unitary transformation U [ U(2), there exists a finite product of H and T that approximates U with arbitrary precision, up to a complex phase.306 In other words, arbitrary rotations in the Bloch sphere can be efficiently approximated by a combination of the Hadamard H and T gates.\nExamples of two-qubit gates U [ U(4) are the controlled gates, where the state of the control qubit determines the quantum operation performed on the target qubit. A controlled-U gate performs a unitary operation U on a target qubit if the control qubit is in the state 1j i and leaves the target qubit unchanged if the control qubit is in the state 0j i and is represented by\nC(U) \u00bc 1 U : (77)\nNotable examples are the controlled Pauli gates, i.e., the controlled-X (CX), also called the controlled-NOT gate (CNOT), the controlled-Y (CY), and the controlled-Z (CZ) gates, respectively, with U \u00bc X, Y , Z.\nA set of quantum gates is called universal if any unitary evolution of N qubits can be approximated to arbitrary accuracy by a finite sequence of gates in the set. A universal quantum computer can thus implement all possible unitary operations on its qubits with arbitrary accuracy. Moreover, the Solovay\u2013Kitaev theorem307,308 guarantees that this can be done efficiently, i.e., the number of unitary operations required to approximate an arbitrary unitary operation to a given accuracy \u03b5 grows logarithmically with 1=\u03b5. A common choice (but not unique) for a universal set of quantum gates is given by the T gate, Hadamard H gate, and the CNOT gate: The unitary evolution of an arbitrary number of qubits can be efficiently approximated by a finite sequence of these gates. A smaller subset of unitary evolutions in U(2N 1) is represented by the Clifford group CN 1, which is generated by the Clifford gates, i.e., the S gate, Hadamard H gate, and the CNOT gate. The Clifford gates alone are not universal but become universal with the addition of the T gate.306 This is essentially because the Clifford gates\nJ. Appl.

Furthermore, the two-qubit CNOT gate can be implemented in a topologically protected way by combining fermion-parity projective measurements and single-qubit Clifford gates implemented by braiding.310\u2013313 Hence, Majorana modes can implement the full set of topologically protected Clifford gates.\nAn intrinsic limitation of Majorana qubits is that the T gate cannot be realized by braiding. Nevertheless, the T gate can still be implemented in a topologically unprotected way by bringing two Majorana modes close to each other and allowing them to dynamically dephase or by manipulating the geometric phase314,315 of the trijunction Hamiltonian in Eq. (67). The accuracy of topologically unprotected T gates can be significantly improved by using the so-called \u201cmagic-state distillation.\u201d305,312,316,317 Another route to provide the missing phase gate is by coupling topological qubits with conventional (nontopological) qubits.318\u2013323 However, all these approaches necessarily break topological protection and cannot provide universal quantum computation in a fully topologically protected way.\nFIG. 9.

Besides, the finite gap in the quasiparticle spectra in the superconducting phase suppresses thermal fluctuations and confines the unitary evolution within the degenerate groundstate. As a result, topological protection significantly reduces computational errors, providing a considerable advantage over nontopological quantum computation schemes. However, braiding errors cannot be completely avoided due to the occurrence of nonadiabatic processes287\u2013289,330\u2013335 or processes that break fermion parity conservation, such as quasiparticle poisoning, i.e., the tunneling of superconducting quasiparticles from the external environment that breaks fermion parity conservation.336\u2013338 Indeed, braid operations need to be performed slow enough to be adiabatic but fast enough to avoid decoherence. If the adiabaticity condition is not met, the braiding process will produce a superposition of many-body states with higher-energy excitations above the particle\u2013hole gap and away from the groundstate manifold. Therefore, the exchange process must be performed on time scales longer than the time scale determined by the particle\u2013hole gap \u03c4ph \u00bc h=\u0394Eph to avoid nonadiabatic effects, where \u0394Eph is the energy gap separating the excited states from the groundstate. This\ntime scale can be, in principle, reduced by implementing the so-called shortcuts to adiabaticity, i.e., by suppressing nonadiabatic effects via counterdiabatic terms in the Hamiltonian introduced via additional couplings between noncontiguous Majorana modes.285,339 On the other hand, the braiding process must be performed on time scales shorter than the coherence time of the Majorana qubit. The coherence time is determined by the inverse of the tunneling rate between Majorana modes at finite distance \u0393L / e L=\u03beM ,234,238,340 the rate of thermal excitations \u0393T / e \u0394=kBT ,234,238,340,341 and the quasiparticle poisoning rate \u0393QP. Moreover, as mentioned before, Majorana modes cannot realize universal quantum computation in a fully topologically protected way, since the T gate cannot be implemented only by braiding Majorana modes. From these considerations, it is clear that topological quantum computation still needs to be supplemented by quantum error correction schemes,39,307 which can be provided by the so-called Majorana toric code,342\u2013346 surface codes,347\u2013352 or color codes.352,353\nIn this section, I only discussed some specific aspects of topological quantum computation with Majorana modes.

Spinless electrons do not exist, and superconductivity is not stable against fluctuations in 1D.46 Naively, one may think to address the first issue by simply generalizing Eq. (17) to good old-fashioned spin-1/2 electrons by considering two copies of the Hamiltonian H\" and H#, one for each of the two spin channels. Hence, in an open chain H\" \u00feH# with j\u03bcj , 2t, one will obtain two Majorana end modes per boundary, having opposite spins \u03b3\" and \u03b3#. This system realizes the so-called Majorana Kramers pairs, which appear in time-reversal-invariant topological superconductors in 1D356\u2013364 (see Ref. 138 for a review on the topic). However, since Majorana Kramers pairs are protected by time-reversal symmetry, they are not robust against local perturbations which break this symmetry, e.g., magnetic impurities. Indeed, without any additional symmetry constraints, local perturbations may hybridize the two degenerate modes at each end. Consequently, their energies become finite, lifting the groundstate degeneracy. Hence, the Hamiltonian can be continuously deformed without closing the particle\u2013hole gap into a trivial Hamiltonian without end modes if time-reversal symmetry is not enforced.\nConsequently, to obtain unpaired Majorana modes localized at opposite ends and robust against local perturbations, one needs to lift the Kramers degeneracy between the two spin channels: The only way to escape Kramers theorem is to break time-reversal symmetry. This can be done, for example, by including a ferromagnetic insulator layer59,60 or a half-metal365,366 in the heterostructure or by applying an external magnetic field.25,26,57,58,60 The resulting\nJ.

In this heterostructure, electrons can tunnel between the superconducting bulk and the nanowire, such that electrons in the wire acquire finite superconducting correlations, which can be described as an effective long-range superconducting pairing.62,82,368\u2013371 The magnitude and symmetry of this proximity-induced superconducting pairing are largely determined by the bulk order parameter and interface transparency.\nThe superconducting pairing is described in momentum space by\nHSC \u00bc 12 \u00f0 dk \u03a8\"(k), \u03a8#(k) \u0394\u0302(k) \u03a8\"(k) \u03a8#(k) \u00fe h:c:, (80)\nwhere the superconducting pairing satisfies \u0394\u0302(k) \u00bc \u0394\u0302( k)T due to the antisymmetry of the fermionic wavefunction of the superconducting electrons.253 If no other degrees of freedom are involved, the pairing symmetry can be classified in terms of the spin and angular momentum of the coupled electrons (Cooper pairs). The total spin of the Cooper pairs can be either S \u00bc 0 (spinsinglet) or S \u00bc 1 (spin-triplet), which correspond to antisymmetric and symmetric spin states, respectively. Since the superconducting pairing needs to be antisymmetric, spin-singlet pairing requires even-parity angular momentum (e.g., L \u00bc 0, s-wave, or L \u00bc 2, d-wave) while spin-triplet pairing requires odd-parity angular momentum (e.g., L \u00bc 1, p-wave). Ideally, one would like to employ odd-parity, spin-triplet bulk superconductors14,16,47 to couple electrons with parallel spins and achieve an effective \u201cspinless\u201d superconductivity separately in the two spin channels. However, these unconventional superconductors have low critical temperatures , 1 K and a rather small superconducting gap. On the other hand, conventional s-wave singlet-paring superconductors have a relatively higher critical temperature (e.g., Tc \u00bc 9:25 K for niobium) and larger superconducting gap. Moreover, they are abundant in nature, and their physics is well understood in terms of the microscopic BCS theory.244,245\nIn a nanowire proximitized with a conventional superconductor, one expects a proximity-induced pairing comparable to or smaller than the bulk superconducting pairing. Proximity effects are effectively described by modeling the superconducting correlations of the semiconductor-superconductor interface at a meanfield level and integrating out the degrees of freedom of the bulk.62,82,368\u2013371 At low energies, the resulting proximity-induced pairing can be written as \u0394 \u00bc \u0393\u03940=(\u0393\u00fe \u03940), where \u03940 is the bulk\nsuperconducting pairing and \u0393 is the coupling between the bulk superconductor and the nanowire, which depends on the density of states and the transparency of the interface.61,62,64,82,368\u2013371 The proximity effect will also induce a renormalization of the other energy scales of the nanowire.64,82,369\u2013371 For a more extended discussion on the proximity effect in Majorana wires, see Ref. 218."

            "text": "The last ingredient is spin\u2013orbit coupling, which is necessary to avoid the closing of the particle\u2013hole gap in the topologically nontrivial phase. In a single-band 1D without spin-orbit coupling (neglecting orbital degrees of freedom) and in a magnetic field, electron spin is a good quantum number and a conserved quantity, and consequently, electrons with spin parallel and antiparallel to the field direction form two distinct bands with a finite energy splitting. In particular, electrons in the lowest energy band crossing the Fermi level have the same spin. In this case, the proximity-induced superconducting pairing cannot couple electrons within the same band, since spin-singlet pairing only couples electrons with opposite spins and momenta. Consequently, the particle\u2013hole gap closes even in the presence of a finite superconducting pairing. However, to realize topologically protected end modes, one needs to keep the particle\u2013hole gap open. This can be done by tilting the directions of the spin of electrons having opposite momenta. A finite spin\u2013orbit coupling induces an effective magnetic field in the direction of the electron momentum, which competes with the bare magnetic field in fixing the direction of the electron spin. Consequently, electrons with the same energy and opposite momenta have their spins tilted in different directions. This tilting allows electrons within the same band and opposite momenta to couple via the conventional superconducting pairing, thus avoiding the closing of the particle\u2013hole gap at finite magnetic fields. As I will clarify in Sec. IV B 4, the combined effect of spin-orbit coupling, time-reversal symmetry breaking, and proximitized conventional (spin-singlet) superconductivity is equivalent to an effective spin-triplet superconducting pairing between effectively spinless electrons.\nSpin\u2013orbit coupling in heterostructures can emerge as the direct effect of the presence of an electric field E. For a relativistic electron in an electric field, the Dirac equation can be approximated at the second-order perturbation theory in powers of 1=c by an effective low-energy Hamiltonian density372,373 that reads\nH \u00bc p 2 2m \u00fe eV p 4 8m3c2 e h 4m2c2 \u03c3 E p\u00f0 \u00de e h 2 8m2c2 \u2207E, (81)\nwith \u03c3 \u00bc [\u03c3x , \u03c3y , \u03c3z] being the vector of Pauli matrices. Here, the fourth term /\u03c3 (E p) is the spin\u2013orbit coupling induced by the electric field. Notice that this term does not break time-reversal symmetry since E is even, whereas p and \u03c3 are both odd under time-reversal. In nanowire heterostructures, the dominant contribution to the spin\u2013orbit coupling is due to the broken spacereflection symmetry at the interface between the wire and its substrate. This is the case of the so-called Rashba spin\u2013orbit coupling, which arises due to a net nonzero electric field E \u00bc \u2207V induced by the sudden variation of the electrostatic potential at the\nJ.

It can be shown that such a rotating field is unitarily equivalent to a system with a uniform field along a fixed direction and an effective spin\u2013orbit coupling with a strength proportional to the spatial derivative of the field angle67,68,378 (see also Ref. 223).

In addition, since the magnetic field inevitably suppresses the superconducting pairing, one would like to have a large g-factor to maximize the resulting Zeeman fields with relatively small externally applied magnetic fields. Finally, one would like to have large spin\u2013orbit couplings to keep the particle\u2013hole gap open in the nontrivial phase, even in the presence of disorder.\nSo far, the most promising physical systems are the so-called Majorana nanowires, i.e., semiconductor nanowires with strong spin\u2013orbit coupling (e.g., InAs, InSb) proximitized by a conventional superconductor in an external magnetic field,25,26 as in Fig. 10(a). The applied magnetic field B breaks the time-reversal symmetry, whereas the superconducting substrate induces a finite superconducting pairing in the nanowire by proximity effect. Moreover, a finite spin\u2013orbit coupling is provided by the broken space-reflection symmetry at the interface between the nanowire and the substrate and by the intrinsic broken space inversion symmetry of the semiconductor crystal lattice.376 An ideal Majorana nanowire, with a single electronic band with parabolic dispersion at the Fermi level and in an external magnetic field, proximityinduced pairing, and finite spin-orbit coupling, is described by an effective continuum Hamiltonian, known as the Oreg\u2013Lutchyn minimal model,25,26 which reads\nH \u00bc \u00f0 dx h \u03a8y(x)\np2x 2m \u00fe \u03b1 h \u03c3ypx \u03bc\u00fe b \u03c3 \u03a8(x)\n\u00fe\u03a8(x) 1 2 \u0394eifi\u03c3y \u03a8(x)\u00fe h:c:\ni , (82)\nwhere \u03a8(x) \u00bc [\u03a8\"(x), \u03a8#(x)] is the real-space electronic field, px \u00bc i h@x the momentum operator, m the effective mass, \u03b1 the spin\u2013orbit coupling strength, \u03bc 0 the chemical potential measured from the bottom of the electronic band, b \u00bc (g\u03bcB=2)B the Zeeman field, with g the effective Land\u00e9 g-factor, \u03bcB the Bohr magneton, B the applied magnetic field, and \u0394eif the proximity-induced superconducting pairing with \u0394 . 0. Again, since the phase of the superconducting pairing can always be absorbed by a unitary transformation, let us assume f \u00bc 0 for simplicity.

Precisely, one can show that the Oreg\u2013Lutchyn Hamiltonian is equivalent to two decoupled spinless p-wave superconductors corresponding to two energy bands with opposite helicity.60,395 Following Ref. 395, after a unitary rotation of the spin basis into the direction uk \u00bc rk=rk and a unitary Bogoliubov transformation, the Oreg\u2013Lutchyn Hamiltonian in Eq.

The fact that the effective pairing depends explicitly on the magnetic field, proximitized pairing, and spin-orbit coupling, confirms that all these ingredients are necessary to realize topological superconductivity. This Hamiltonian is topologically equivalent to the Hamiltonian of a 1D p-wave superconductor in Eq. (6). Indeed, at large momenta k ! 1, the quadratic term dominates H+(k) ( h2=2m)k2\u03c4x , and the energy levels are / k2, as in Eq. (6).

The Hamiltonian sector H (k) instead has two gapped phases with a positive and negative mass gap, respectively, for b2 + \u03bc2 \u00fe \u03942, separated by a topological quantum phase transition at b \u00bc ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi \u03bc2 \u00fe \u03942 p , where the particle\u2013hole gap closes at k \u00bc 0.

On the other hand, the gapped phase with a negative mass gap at large magnetic fields b . ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi \u03bc2 \u00fe \u03942 p is topologically nontrivial. The fact that the particle\u2013hole gap closes exactly at k \u00bc 0 is again not coincidental: it is a direct consequence of the p-wave symmetry of the effective superconducting pairing /\u03b1k\u0394=b. Since the p-wave pairing is an odd function of the momentum, it can only vanish at k \u00bc 0. Thus, the particle\u2013hole gap can close only at k \u00bc 0 if the mass gap ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi \u03bc2 \u00fe \u03942 p b vanishes altogether.\nFigure 12 shows the energy dispersion E+(k) of the superconducting quasiparticles compared with the bare electron dispersion \u03b5k for different regimes. Figure 12(a) shows the quasiparticle dispersion in the case of zero spin-orbit coupling and finite magnetic field. In this case, time-reversal symmetry is broken, the Kramers degeneracy is lifted, but the gap is closed at finite momenta. This is because electrons at zero energy have parallel spin, and thus their energy cannot be gapped by the spin-singlet superconducting pairing, which only couples antiparallel spin components. Figure 12(b) shows the case of finite spin-orbit coupling and zero magnetic field. In this case, the particle\u2013hole gap remains open, but the gapped phase does not break time-reversal symmetry and thus cannot realize nontrivial superconductivity. Figure 12(c) shows the case where both the spin\u2013orbit coupling and the magnetic field are nonzero, with the field perpendicular to the spin\u2013 orbit coupling. In this case, time-reversal symmetry is broken, and spin\u2013orbit coupling allows a finite superconducting pairing\nbetween electrons with opposite momenta.

The phase space of the Majorana nanowire is shown in Fig. 13.\nIn the above discussion, the magnetic field direction has been chosen to be parallel to the wire direction (x axis), perpendicular to the surface of the superconductor (z axis), or lying in the plane zx [see Fig. 10(a)]. Indeed, if the magnetic field is instead applied along the transverse direction y, i.e., parallel to the spin-orbit coupling field, the particle\u2013hole gap cannot remain open at finite magnetic fields. In this case, electrons have a well-defined spin along y (it is a good quantum number) and have a finite energy splitting between states with spin sy \u00bc + h=2. Consequently, electrons at zero energy have parallel spin, the superconducting pairing cannot lift their energy, and the particle\u2013hole gap remains closed. For arbitrary directions of the magnetic field by \u00bc b cos \u03b8, the particle\u2013hole gap decreases and finally closes for jbyj . \u0394, preventing the existence of the topologically nontrivial phase.396\u2013398"

For instance, the chemical potential, magnetic field, superconducting pairing, and spin\u2013orbit coupling may become spatial-dependent, i.e., \u03bc ! \u03bc(x), b ! b(x), \u03b1 ! \u03b1(x), and \u0394 ! \u0394(x), in order to describe, e.g., smooth variations of the chemical potential or partial proximization of the wire,146,195,399\u2013401 spatially dependent magnetic fields,65,68,70 or the effect of disorder.402\u2013404 Another straightforward generalization is to consider arbitrary directions of the spin\u2013orbit coupling, for example, by rewriting the spin\u2013orbit coupling term in Eq.

These setups include the so-called full-shell nanowires, i.e., semiconducting nanowires fully coated by a superconducting shell,71,72 shown in Fig. 10(d). In these devices, a magnetic field parallel to the wire induces a finite magnetic flux through the nanowire section and the consequent winding of the superconducting phase around the wire. Moreover, the breaking of the local inversion symmetry at the interface between the wire and the superconductor provides a radial electric field that corresponds to a finite spin\u2013orbit coupling. By approximating the hexagonal wire as a cylinder, the zero angular momentum sector of the Bogoliubov\u2013de Gennes Hamiltonian becomes\nequivalent to the Oreg\u2013Lutchyn Hamiltonian, with an effective Zeeman field determined by the magnetic flux.71 Another setup is realized by hexagonal nanowires where two side facets are covered by a ferromagnetic insulator (e.g., EuS), and two facets covered by a superconductor, with one facet covered by both,426 shown in Fig. 10 (e). In these hybrid nanowires, the role of the Zeeman field is played by the exchange coupling induced by proximity effect from the ferromagnetic insulator.73,75\u201378 Finally, the Oreg\u2013Lutchyn model can be employed to describe other 1D platforms, such as metallic nanowires88,90 or 1D stripes in epitaxial semiconductor-superconductor heterostructures (e.g., planar Josephson junctions).87\u201398"

            "text": "The first step to understanding the topological properties of the Oreg\u2013Lutchyn model and any of its generalizations is to determine its symmetry classification. For a superconductor made of ordinary spin-1/2 electrons, the particle\u2013hole, time-reversal, and chiral symmetries are defined by\nC \u00bc \u03c4xK, T \u00bc i\u03c3yK, S \u00bc T C \u00bc i\u03c3y\u03c4x , (105)\nin the basis where the Nambu spinor is given by \u03a8y(k) \u00bc [\u03a8y\"(k), \u03a8y#(k), \u03a8\"( k), \u03a8#( k)] or, alternatively,\nC \u00bc \u03c3y\u03c4yK, T \u00bc i\u03c3yK, S \u00bc T C \u00bc i\u03c4y , (106)\nin the unitary equivalent basis where the Nambu spinor becomes \u03a8y(k) \u00bc [\u03a8y\"(k), \u03a8y#(k), \u03a8#( k), \u03a8\"( k)] (see Appendix D). One has C2 \u00bc 1, T 2 \u00bc 1, and S2 \u00bc 1. In the superconducting state, particle\u2013hole symmetry is always unbroken, i.e., CHC 1 \u00bc H. Time-reversal symmetry is unbroken by spin\u2013orbit coupling and by the superconducting pairing term, as long as the superconducting phase f is uniform. Indeed, a uniform superconducting phase can always be gauged away f ! 0 such that the superconducting pairing term becomes manifestly invariant under the antiunitary transformation T . However, time-reversal symmetry is broken by the magnetic field since one has\nT (b \u03c3)T 1 \u00bc b \u03c3: (107)\nand in this case, chiral symmetry S \u00bc T C is broken as well. Unbroken particle\u2013hole and broken time-reversal symmetries correspond to the symmetry class D, where the topologically inequivalent phases in 1D are labeled by the Z2 invariant.\nGenerally, the symmetry operator T coincides with the physical time-reversal symmetry, which transforms the magnetic field as B ! B. However, concerning symmetry classes, the operator T does not need to coincide with the ordinary time-reversal symmetry, as already mentioned. Indeed, one may consider a second set of artificial \u201ctime-reversal\u201d and \u201cchiral\u201d symmetries255,409 defined by\nT 0 \u00bc K, (108a)\nS0 \u00bc T 0C (108b)\nwhere T 02 \u00bc 1 and S02 \u00bc 1 with S0 \u00bc \u03c4x or S0 \u00bc \u03c3y\u03c4y depending on the choice of the Nambu basis. The artificial \u201ctime-reversal\u201d T 0 and chiral S0 symmetries are still unbroken by spin\u2013orbit coupling and by superconducting pairings with a uniform phase. However, regarding the magnetic field, one has bxz ! bxz and by ! by under T 0: Hence, the artificial \u201ctime-reversal\u201d symmetry T 0 is broken by any finite component by . 0 of the magnetic field in the y direction, i.e., the direction of the spin\u2013orbit coupling field. Therefore, if the magnetic field is perpendicular to the direction of the spin\u2013orbit coupling y, the \u201ctime-reversal\u201d symmetry T 0 is unbroken. Unbroken particle\u2013hole and time-reversal symmetries with T 02 \u00bc S02 \u00bc 1 correspond to the symmetry class BDI, where\nthe topologically inequivalent phases in 1D are labeled by the Z invariant. Analogously to the spinless case in Eq. (36), the Z invariant can be calculated as the winding number of a vector constructed from the chiral-symmetric representation of the Hamiltonian255,256,409 (see also Ref. 218).\nIn a realistic experimental setup, the artificial \u201ctime-reversal\u201d T 0 symmetry is inevitably broken by magnetic disorder, misalignment of the magnetic field, or interband spin-orbit couplings in multiband nanowires.408 In all these cases, the topological invariant describing the Oreg\u2013Lutchyn model in symmetry class D is the pfaffian Z2 invariant, which can be defined as 255,256\n( 1)\u03bd \u00bc sgn pf H(0)S0\u00f0 \u00depf H(\u03c0)S0\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00de, (109)\nin momentum space, with S0 depending on the choice of the Nambu basis. The antisymmetry of the matrix H(k)S0 at k \u00bc 0, \u03c0 is guaranteed by particle\u2013hole symmetry, as in the spinless case [see Eq. (38)].\nFor the Oreg\u2013Lutchyn model on a discrete lattice with f \u00bc 0, using Eq.

            "text": "A 1D topological superconductor in the nontrivial phase exhibits Majorana modes at its boundaries due to the bulkboundary correspondence.28\u201330 A wire with open boundary conditions can be thought of as the same wire with the left and right ends connected to the vacuum, which is topologically trivial. Therefore, the wire ends separate two topologically inequivalent phases, i.e., the nontrivial phase of the topological superconductor and the trivial vacuum. However, topologically inequivalent phases cannot be connected by a smooth transformation without closing the particle\u2013hole gap. Consequently, the gap must vanish at the boundary between trivial and nontrivial phases. This mandates the existence of a zero-energy mode localized at the boundary. In the case of a Majorana nanowire, these zero-energy modes are the Majorana end modes \u03b3L and \u03b3R localized at the left and right ends of the wire. The same reasoning applies when the topological nanowire is connected through a barrier to a metallic lead, a\nJ. Appl.

To see this, let us consider the wavefunction of an end mode in a 1D superconductor, which can be written as\n\u03b3 \u00bc \u00f0 dx\u03c8(x)T \u03a8(x) \u00bc X s\u00bc\"# \u00f0 dx us(x)\u03a8s(x)\u00fe vs(x)\u03a8ys (x) ,\n(113)\nwhere \u03a8y(x) \u00bc [\u03a8y\"(x), \u03a8y#(x), \u03a8\"(x), \u03a8#(x)] is the Nambu spinor in real space, and where the wavefunction can be expressed as\n\u03c8(x) \u00bc u\"(x) u#(x) v\"(x) v#(x)\n2 664\n3 775: (114)\nDue to particle\u2013hole symmetry CHC 1 \u00bc H, the mode described by C\u03c8(x) must have opposite energy with respect to the mode \u03c8(x). Since we assumed the existence of only one mode on each side of the wire, and the hybridization between modes localized at the opposite ends can be neglected (assuming L \u03beM), the mode \u03c8(x) has zero energy and must coincide with its particle\u2013hole conjugate C\u03c8(x) \u00bc \u03c8(x), i.e., \u03c8(x) is an eigenstate of the particle\u2013hole symmetry operator C with zero energy. This mandates v*s (x) \u00bc us(x), which yields\nv \"\u00f0x\u00de v #\u00f0x\u00de u \"\u00f0x\u00de u #\u00f0x\u00de\n2 664\n3 775 \u00bc\nu\"\u00f0x\u00de u#\u00f0x\u00de v\"\u00f0x\u00de v#\u00f0x\u00de\n2 664\n3 775; (115)\nwhich gives \u03b3y \u00bc \u03b3, i.e., the localized zero-energy mode is described by a self-adjoint Majorana operator. Having zero energy, this mode commutes with the Hamiltonian. Hence, Majorana zero modes are described by\n\u03c8(x) \u00bc u\"(x) u#(x) u*\"(x)\nu*#(x)\n2 664\n3 775, (116)\nwhich is an eigenstate of the particle\u2013hole symmetry operator C and the Hamiltonian H.\nThe above argument is strictly valid only in the infinite size limit, i.e., when the spatial separation of the Majorana modes is infinitely larger than their spatial separation. Unfortunately, nanowires have a finite length in the real world. Consequently, Majorana modes localized at the opposite ends become partially\noverlapped and hybridized when the wire length L becomes comparable with their localization length L * \u03beM. Indeed, the Majorana wavefunction decays exponentially with fast oscillations430\u2013432 as \u03c8 / e x=\u03beMe+ikMx where \u03beM is the localization length and kM kF the wavevector associated with the Majorana modes.431 The resulting energy splitting becomes nonzero, being exponentially small in the system size146,427,431\u2013433 and given by431\nEM h 2kF\nm\u03beM cos kML\u00f0 \u00dee 2L=\u03beM : (117)\nHence, the energy of a Majorana bound state approaches zero (up to exponentially small corrections) only for long wires L \u03beM, being strictly zero only in the limit L=\u03beM ! 1. Notice that, at the topological transition, the localization length diverges \u03beM ! 1, and the Majorana modes become fully delocalized on the whole wire. Away from the topological transition instead, one has \u03beM \u03b1=\u0394 and kM 2kSO in the strong spin\u2013orbit regime ESO b, \u0394, and \u03beM (\u03b1=\u0394)bz=ESO \u00bc 2lSObz=\u0394 and kM kZ in the weak spin\u2013orbit regime ESO b, \u0394430,434 (see also Refs. 214 and 223). Since the wavevector kM depends on the magnetic field b and chemical potential \u03bc, the oscillating factor / cos (kML) in the equation above leads to oscillations of the Majorana energy splitting as a function of the magnetic field and chemical potential. These oscillations can be experimentally detected by measuring the variations in the differential conductance in tunneling experiments in the Coulomb blockade regime (see Secs. V A 2 and V C), which would provide a strong signature of the presence of Majorana modes in short nanowires.427,431 However, these oscillations may be suppressed by Coulomb interactions424,431 or the interaction with the dielectric surrounding.422\nFigure 14 shows the topological phase transition and the onset of the Majorana bound state in the nontrivial phase b .ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n\u03bc2 \u00fe \u03942 p\nfor different choices of the wire length. The topological phase transition at b \u00bc ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi \u03bc2 \u00fe \u03942 p [Figs. 14(a) and 14(c)] separates the trivial phase at low fields from the nontrivial phase at higher magnetic fields. In the nontrivial phase, Majorana end modes localize at the ends of the wire and decay exponentially toward the center [Figs. 14(b) and 14(d)]. For long wires, the Majorana modes are well separated in space, and their energy is zero up to exponentially small corrections, as one can see in Figs. 14(a) and 14(b). The hybridization between Majorana modes in short nanowires, due to the overlap between their wavefunctions, induces a finite energy splitting EM which oscillates as a function of the magnetic field, as one can see in Figs. 14(c) and 14(d). For short nanowires, the transition between the topologically trivial and nontrivial phase may occur without an apparent closing and reopening of the particle\u2013hole gap146,400,434\u2013436 with a subgap state at finite energy detaching from the bulk energy spectrum and gradually approaching zero energy,146,437\u2013439 as one can also see in Fig. 14(c).\nAs a direct consequence of their topological origin, Majorana modes are robust: Their existence and their properties are not affected by perturbations, as long as these perturbations are local and do not close the particle\u2013hole gap. Local perturbations having a length scale shorter than the Majorana localization length cannot\nJ. Appl.

For instance, a Majorana nanowire exhibits spatially separated Majorana modes in its nontrivial phase, even in the presence of disorder or other local perturbations, as long as the perturbations do not close the particle\u2013hole gap. Majorana modes are also expected to be free from quantum decoherence, which is a fundamental advantage over other physical implementations of quantum computing.39,41 This is the direct consequence of fermion-parity conservation, spatial separation, and the presence of a finite particle\u2013hole gap. Indeed, transitions between occupied nM \u00bc 1 to unoccupied Majorana bound state nM \u00bc 0 are forbidden by the fermion-parity conservation (the two groundstates have a different fermion parity). Moreover, the tunneling between contiguous Majorana modes is exponentially suppressed in their mutual distance, with tunneling rates / e L=\u03beM .234,238,340 Furthermore, transitions to excited higher-energy states are thermally suppressed by the particle\u2013hole gap, which separates the Majorana bound state from bulk excitations, with transition rates / e \u0394=kBT .234,238,340,341\nHowever, in the real world, fermion parity conservation breaks down as soon as the Majorana wire is coupled to an external system, which is practically unavoidable in any realistic setting. In a typical setup, the Majorana wire is proximitized by a bulk superconductor, capacitively coupled to external gates, and via tunneling junctions to metallic leads used to probe or manipulate Majorana modes. In this case, the conservation of fermion parity is broken due to the so-called quasiparticle poisoning,336 i.e., the tunneling of superconducting quasiparticles from the bulk superconductor337 or a metallic lead.338 These processes allow fermionic states to leak into the superconducting condensate and flip the fermion parity of the superconducting condensate. Furthermore, decoherence may arise at finite temperatures due to transitions into gapped states440 mediated, e.g., by charge fluctuations in the metallic gates,441,442 the residual charge of partially overlapping Majorana modes in finite wires,443 nonuniform chemical potentials,444 or electron\u2013 phonon interactions.445 Other sources of decoherence appear as soon as one tries to dynamically control the Majorana modes to\nFIG. 14.

A thorough account of the topic can be found in Ref. 221.\nAn emblematic example of such near-zero localized states are the so-called quasi-Majorana bound states (also called trivial Majorana bound states, partially-separated or partially overlapping Majorana bound states), which localize near smooth variations of the chemical potential146,195,401,429,437\u2013439,450\u2013453,455\u2013457 or superconducting order parameter.146,195,399,400,429,433,436\u2013439,451,455\u2013458,460\u2013467 To illustrate one of the possible mechanisms which can produce near-zero energy quasi-Majorana bound states, let us consider the case where the chemical potential \u03bc(x) is not uniform but smoothly drops from a finite value \u03bc(x) \u00bc \u03bc0 to zero \u03bc(x) \u00bc 0 at one end of the wire, as shown in the inset of Fig. 14(f).

Other than that, there may be values of the magnetic field such that one segment of the wire is in the nontrivial phase, and the rest remains in the trivial phase. In the specific example considered, for values of\nthe field b , j\u0394j ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi \u03bc(x)2 \u00fe \u03942 p , the whole wire is in the topologi-\ncally trivial phase, while for b . ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi \u03bc20 \u00fe \u03942 p . ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi \u03bc(x)2 \u00fe \u03942 p , the whole wire becomes nontrivial. For intermediate values j\u0394j , b , ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi \u03bc20 \u00fe \u03942 p instead, the leftmost segment of the wire becomes non-\ntrivial being b . ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi \u03bc(x)2 \u00fe \u03942 p , while the rest of the wire remains\ntrivial, being b , ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi \u03bc(x)2 \u00fe \u03942 p , as shown in the inset of Fig. 14(f). Thus, at these intermediate values, one may expect the presence of Majorana modes localized at one end of the wire and at the boundary between the nontrivial and nontrivial segments. Figure 14(e) shows the resulting energy spectra as a function of the magnetic field. At b j\u0394j, an energy level detaches from the bulk and becomes almost zero. Thus, a near zero-energy state may appear at\nlow fields before the closing and reopening of the bulk gap, i.e., before the onset of the topological phase transition to the nontrivial phase. Figure 14(f) shows the probability density of this lowest energy level. This state is given by a quasi-Majorana bound state formed by two overlapping Majorana modes, one localized at the left end of the nanowire, and the other close to one-fourth of the wire,\nwhere the quantity ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi \u03bc(x)2 \u00fe \u03942 p b changes sign, as shown in the inset of Fig. 14(f).

The hybridization between the two Majorana modes of the quasi-Majorana bound state induces a finite energy splitting, which is however very small, being comparable to the hybridization of the two Majorana modes of the nontrivial Majorana bound state. Indeed, the subgap energy level in Fig. 14(f) exhibits near-zero energy well before the topological transition."

In the presence of a Majorana mode at zero energy, the differential conductance exhibits a resonant peak at zero bias, which is quantized to the conductance quantum G0 \u00bc 2e2=h.\nThe differential conductance of an NS junction is the consequence of the so-called Andreev reflections. When an electron from the lead arrives at the NS interface, two distinct physical processes may occur: normal reflection and Andreev reflection. In the case of normal reflection, the electron is simply reflected at the interface back into the metallic lead. Normal reflection results in no net charge transferred through the barrier and zero current I \u00bc 0. In the case of Andreev reflection, the electron is transmitted through the barrier into the superconductor. For energies above the particle\u2013hole gap E . \u0394Eph, the transmitted electron produces a finite current into the superconductor. Below the gap E , \u0394Eph, however, there are no propagating modes available in the superconductor.

From the point of view of the normal lead, this process can be effectively described as an incident electron being reflected back as a hole with opposite momentum. The Andreev reflection from electron to hole results in a net charge transfer of 2e through the barrier. Normal and Andreev reflection can be conceptually described as the transmission through a double barrier, as shown in Fig. 15(b). In this description, the metallic lead is separated into two leads, with each lead having only electron and hole propagating modes, respectively. An incoming electron from the electron lead is then reflected back as an electron (normal reflection) or transmitted to the superconductor and then again transmitted as a hole into the hole lead, with the simultaneous creation of a Cooper pair into the superconductor (Andreev reflection). This transmission process is described by\n\u03c8\u00fee \u03c8\u00feh \u00bc See Seh She Shh\n\u03c8\ne \u03c8 h , (118)\nwhere \u03c8 e and \u03c8 h are the incoming and \u03c8 \u00fe e and \u03c8 \u00fe h the outgoing electron and hole wavefunctions, respectively. For a nanowire with M subgap modes and with an applied voltage E \u00bc eV , the scattering matrix is given by\nS(E) \u00bc See Seh She Shh , (119)\nwhere the different M M blocks S\u03b1\u03b2 describe the normal and the Andreev reflection processes. The diagonal blocks See and Shh describe the normal reflection from electron to electron and from hole to hole, which results in no net charge transfer through the barrier. The offdiagonal blocks She and Seh describe instead the Andreev reflection from hole to electron and from electron to hole, which results in a net charge transfer of 2e through the barrier. Below the gap E , \u0394Eph, assuming homogeneous and clean wires long enough to neglect transmission processes at the opposite end\nof the wire, the total amount of incoming electrons must equal the outgoing electrons (normally reflected) and outgoing holes (Andreev-reflected). Hence, the conservation of the probability current mandates that SyS \u00bc 1, i.e., the scattering matrix is unitary (see Refs. 213 and 473).\nThe differential conductance is given by the Landauer formula,213,474\u2013477 which at zero temperature and below the gap E , \u0394Eph gives\nG(E) \u00bc dI dV \u00bc 2e 2 h tr(SehS y eh) \u00bc 2e2 h XM m\u00bc1 sm, (120)\nwhere sm are the eigenvalues of the matrix SehS y eh. The factor 2 in the formula above is not due to the spin degeneracy but to the fact that the Andreev reflection of one electron e amounts to the transfer of a charge 2e into the superconductor. The eigenvalues sn are called the Andreev reflection eigenvalues and are equal to the transmission probabilities of each mode m, and are thus 0 sm 1, with sm \u00bc 0 and sm \u00bc 1 corresponding to perfect normal and perfect Andreev reflection, respectively.\nAt zero bias, the possible values of the differential conductance are entirely determined by symmetry considerations.49,50,63,213 In a superconductor, the scattering matrix must exhibit particle\u2013 hole symmetry\nCS(E)C 1 \u00bc \u03c4xS(E)*\u03c4x \u00bc S( E), (121)\nwhich at zero bias E \u00bc 0 mandates \u03c4xS(0)*\u03c4x \u00bc S(0), i.e.,\nSee Seh She Shh \u00bc S * hh S * he S*eh S * ee \u00bc See Seh S*eh S * ee , (122)\nthat is, See \u00bc S*hh and She \u00bc S*eh.

Hence, one can define a topological invariant \u03bd [ Z2 of the scattering matrix63,213,476,477 as\n( 1)\u03bd \u00bc det (S(0)) \u00bc +1, (123)\nwith trivial and nontrivial regimes corresponding to \u03bd \u00bc 0 and \u03bd \u00bc 1, respectively. Another consequence of particle\u2013hole symmetry is the B\u00e9ri degeneracy213,478 of the Andreev reflection eigenvalues sm: Due to particle\u2013hole symmetry, all Andreev reflection eigenvalues sm are degenerate, except for the values sm \u00bc 0 and sm \u00bc 1, corresponding, respectively, to perfect normal and perfect Andreev reflection. B\u00e9ri degeneracy enforced by particle\u2013hole symmetry is analogous to Kramers degeneracy enforced by timereversal symmetry.\nFor a single mode below the gap, particle\u2013hole symmetry gives det(S(0)) \u00bc jSeej2 jSehj2 \u00bc +1, and unitarity gives jSeej2 \u00fe jSehj2 \u00bc 1. These two conditions fully determine the scattering matrix in the trivial and nontrivial regime and the differential conductance, which in this case is simply given by G \u00bc (2e2=h)jSehj2. In the trivial case, one has det(S(0)) \u00bc 1 and, therefore, jSeej \u00bc 1 and jSehj \u00bc 0. This corresponds to a regime of perfect normal reflection with zero conductance at zero bias\nS(0) \u00bc e i\u03b8 0 0 e i\u03b8 , ( 1)\u03bd \u00bc 1, G(0) \u00bc 0, (124)\nas follows from Eqs.

This corresponds to a regime of perfect Andreev reflection, with a quantized conductance at zero bias\nS(0) \u00bc 0 e i\u03b8\ne i\u03b8 0\n, ( 1)\u03bd \u00bc 1, G(0) \u00bc 2e\n2\nh , (125)\nas follows again from Eqs. (120) and (123). The conductance exhibits a resonant zero-bias peak which is quantized and equal to the conductance quantum G0. This result can also be understood in terms of the B\u00e9ri degeneracy. The Andreev reflection eigenvalue s1 cannot be degenerate in the presence of one subgap mode. Consequently, due to the B\u00e9ri degeneracy, it must necessarily be s1 \u00bc 0 or 1, which thus corresponds to G \u00bc 0 or G \u00bc G0 in Eqs. (124) and (125). The regimes of perfect normal and perfect Andreev reflections are the only possible regimes allowed by particle\u2013hole symmetry and by the conservation of the probability current (unitarity).

The peak at zero bias has a lorentzian shape with quantized height G(0) \u00bc G0 and width \u0393. The values of the conductance at zero bias in the trivial and nontrivial regimes follow only from symmetry considerations and are, therefore, not affected by the height of the barrier, disorder, or other perturbations: The conductance can change from its quantized value to zero only by removing the Majorana bound state at zero energy, which requires the closing and reopening of the particle\u2013hole gap and the concomitant change of the topological invariant. Indeed, disorder may only affect the broadening of the peak, but not its height.63,404 However, this is strictly true only at zero-temperature T \u00bc 0 for Majorana bound states with exactly zero energy EM \u00bc 0, and if the effect of perturbations breaking fermion-parity conservation, e.g., quasiparticle poisoning, can be neglected.336\u2013338 Indeed, in finite-size wires, the Majorana modes localized at opposite ends hybridize, thereby resulting in a finite energy splitting EM . 0: In this case, the quantized conductance becomes145,431\nG(E) \u00bc 2e 2 h \u03932E2\n(E2 E2M)2 \u00fe \u03932E2 , (127)\nwhich describes two peaks centered at E \u00bc +EM with quantized conductance G(+EM) \u00bc G0, giving zero conductance at zero bias G(0) \u00bc 0, as shown in Fig. 15(c).

Moreover, zero and nearzero quantized peaks can also appear in d-wave high-temperature superconductors,487\u2013489 which were later proven to have a topological origin.490 Hence, quantized peaks at zero bias do not necessarily correspond to the presence of topologically protected Majorana bound states but may have alternative explanations. This fact motivates the investigation of alternative, and possibly stronger, signatures and alternative setups.\nFor example, the simultaneous appearance of Majorana modes at the opposite ends of a nanowire can be probed in multiterminal setups,438,451,491\u2013495 e.g., by measuring the differential conductance matrix\nS \u00bc SLL SLR SRL SRR \u00bc dIL=dVL dIL=dVR dIR=dVL dIR=dVR , (129)\nwhere diagonal terms correspond to the local conductances (conductance on the same lead) and the offdiagonal terms to the nonlocal conductances (conductance between leads), with IL,R and VL,R, respectively, the voltages and currents measured at the left and right leads connected to the opposite ends of the wire. This allows verifying the presence of zero-energy states simultaneously at the two ends of the nanowire and the concomitant closing and reopening of the bulk gap at the topological phase transition.\nA direct signature of fractionalization can be obtained by measuring the differential conductance through a spinless quantum dot coupled to the end of a Majorana nanowire.469,496 In the nontrivial regime, the Majorana mode at the end of the wire partially leaks into the quantum dot, inducing a resonant peak in the differential conductance through the dot with a quantized height given by\nG \u00bc G0 4 \u00bc e 2 2h : (130)\nThe value of the quantized peak G0=4 has to be contrasted to the quantized peak of a single spinless electronic mode in the dot G0=2 and that of a spin-degenerate electronic mode G0. This signature can be intuitively described as the resonant peak of \u201chalf\u201d an electronic mode, which corresponds to the leaked Majorana mode in the dot. Quantum dots coupled to nanowires can also be employed to probe the spin degree of freedom147,320,497,498 and the nonlocality147,469,499 of Majorana modes.\nAnother direct signature of Majorana bound states is the presence of quantized half-integer plateaus in the quantum point contact conductance in the ballistic regime.148 As a consequence of the B\u00e9ri degeneracy, the ballistic point conductance in the topologically nontrivial phase exhibits plateaus with quantized conductance given by\nG \u00bc (2n\u00fe 1)G0 \u00bc (2n\u00fe 1) 2e 2\nh with n \u00bc 0, 1, . . . , (131)\nas a function of the bias voltage, with the first plateau G \u00bc G0 being topologically robust against perturbations. This has to be contrasted with the quantized integer plateaus G \u00bc 2nG0 in the\ntopologically trivial phase and G \u00bc nG0 in normal (nonsuperconducting) quantum point contacts, with first plateaus G \u00bc 0 at zero bias. The height of the first plateau in the nontrivial phase is thus halved compared to the trivial phase. This signature as well can be seen as a consequence of fractionalization, i.e., a Majorana mode being \u201chalf\u201d the degree of freedom of an electron in a superconductor.\nOther conductance signatures which may distinguish between Majorana bound states and other trivial Andreev bound states can be obtained in alternative setups employing dissipative leads suppressing the contribution of trivial bound states,500,501 superconducting leads,502 or spin-polarized leads.472,503\u2013505"

This setup corresponds to a linear junction of two superconductors separated by a semiconducting barrier, as shown schematically in Fig. 16(a). In a normal Josephson junction (i.e., topologically trivial), the Josephson current506,507 is described by the Josephson equations\nI \u00bc Ic sinf, @tf \u00bc 2eV h , (132)\nwhere Ic is the so-called critical current, f \u00bc fL fR the (gauge-invariant) phase difference, and V is the voltage bias between the two superconductors. In a tunnel junction, the critical current is given by the Ambegaokar\u2013Baratoff formula508 Ic \u00bc (\u03c0\u0394=2eRN)tanh(\u0394=2kBT), where RN is the normal state resistance of the junction, given by 1=RN \u00bc (e2=h)TN, where TN is the transparency of the junction. Typically, Josephson junctions are driven either by direct or alternating currents. In the DC Josephson regime, the junction is current-driven, i.e., the current is kept constant in time with a value I [ [ Ic, Ic], corresponding to a zero voltage bias V \u00bc 0 and constant phase f. In the AC Josephson regime, instead, the junction is voltage-driven with a finite voltage bias V . 0. This results in the phase f increasing linearly in time and a current with amplitude Ic and frequency \u03c9J \u00bc 2eV= h. Alternatively, in the inverse AC Josephson regime, the junction is driven by microwave radiation \u03c9R, which induces a sinusoidal current in the junction. This results in a staircase pattern in the current\u2013voltage dependence, known as Shapiro steps,509 due to the resonances between the microwave frequency and the phase winding induced by the voltage bias, occurring for \u03c9J \u00bc n\u03c9R, with n integer (see Ref. 510). In all these setups, the phase difference is determined by the current and the voltage bias via Eq. (132). However, the phase difference of the Josephson junction can be directly controlled by embedding the junction in an Aharonov\u2013Bohm ring, i.e., a superconducting ring threaded by a magnetic flux, as shown schematically\nJ. Appl. Phys. 132, 231101 (2022); doi: 10.1063/5.0102999 132, 231101-36\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2022\n18 January 2024 22:46:27\nin Fig. 16(b). Due to the Aharonov-Bohm effect, the magnetic flux \u03a6 through the ring induces a finite phase difference f \u00bc 2\u03c0\u03a6=\u03a60, where \u03a60 \u00bc h=2e is the superconducting flux quantum. For an overview of the Josephson effect, see Refs. 508, 511, and 512.\nThe Josephson current can be directly calculated from the BdG Hamiltonian of the junction. Since the energy variation in a time interval is equal to the work done IV , from Eq. (132) follows that the energy increase over time is \u00d0 Edt \u00bc \u00d0 IVdt\n\u00bc ( h=2e) \u00d0 Idf. Therefore, the current is given by I \u00bc (2e= h)@fE, where E is the total energy of the junction, up to constant terms. This energy can be identified with the groundstate energy of the BdG Hamiltonian, which is the state with all quasiparticle hole states occupied, and is thus given by the sum of all occupied energy levels (with negative energy) E \u00bc Pn En. Hence, the Josephson current is\nI \u00bc 2e h @E @f \u00bc 2e h X n @En @f , (133)\nwhere the sum is extended over all occupied levels. Since the Hamiltonian is invariant up to a gauge transformation f ! f\u00fe 2\u03c0, one may naively expect that the energy levels En, and consequently the current, are always periodic in the phase with periodicity 2\u03c0. However, this is not the case in the presence of\nMajorana zero modes. The phase periodicity of the Josephson current doubles in the presence of Majorana modes, resulting in a 4\u03c0 periodic dependence.\nLet us consider a concrete example, e.g., a nanowire proximitized by two superconducting leads, as shown in Fig. 10(b), modeled as two 1D superconducting segments coupled by a tunneling barrier, as shown in Fig. 16(a). If both segments are in the nontrivial phase, they will both exhibit Majorana zero modes localized at their boundaries, with two inner Majorana modes localized across the junction and two outer Majorana modes localized away from the junction, one for each segment. If the Majorana delocalization length is smaller than the length of the wire, the effect of the outer Majorana modes localized away from the junction can be neglected. Hence, the low-energy effective Hamiltonian is just\nHeff (f) \u00bc i2EM(f)\u03b3L\u03b3R \u00bc EM(f) nM 1 2 , (134)\nwhere \u03b3L and \u03b3R are the Majorana modes localized at the left and right sides of the junction, nM \u00bc (1\u00fe i\u03b3L\u03b3R)=2 is the corresponding number operator [cf. Eq. (49)] of the fermionic operator dM \u00bc (\u03b3L \u00fe i\u03b3R)=2, and EM(f) is the coupling strength, which depends on the phase difference across the junction. This is the most general Hamiltonian of two coupled Majorana modes [see, e.g., Eq. (58)]. It has two energy eigenvalues 0j i and 1j i which are also eigenvalues of the number operator nM with a well-defined fermion parity: the even state with nM 0j i \u00bc 0 and the odd state with nM 1j i \u00bc 1j i with energies EM(f)=2 and EM(f)=2. The unique signatures of the Majorana zero modes can be understood from the Hamiltonian above using symmetry considerations. Let us slowly (adiabatically) change the superconducting phase fL ! fL \u00fe 2\u03c0 on the left side. Since the phase of the superconducting pairing can be absorbed by a unitary transformation cn ! e if=2cn [see Eq. (17)], this change corresponds to cn ! cn and \u03b3L ! \u03b3L, as one can verify from Eq. (40). Consequently, we end up flipping the number operator nM ! 1 nM and the fermion parity and reversing the sign of the Hamiltonian above. However, since the Hamiltonian must be invariant under the gauge transformation f ! f\u00fe 2\u03c0, one has that Heff (f\u00fe 2\u03c0) \u00bc Heff (f), which mandates EM(f\u00fe 2\u03c0) \u00bc EM(f), i.e., the energy of the junction is not 2\u03c0 periodic anymore. This also gives that EM(f\u00fe 4\u03c0) \u00bc EM(f), i.e., the energy EM(f) is 4\u03c0 periodic. Moreover, Eq. (133) yields\nI(f) \u00bc e h @fEM(f) 2nM 1\u00f0 \u00de: (135)\nAs one can see, the Josephson current depends explicitly on the occupation number of the Majorana bound state at the junction. If the fermion parity is conserved, the occupation number of the Majorana bound states at the junction is conserved as well: Consequently, the current I(f) is 4\u03c0 periodic and with I(f\u00fe 2\u03c0) \u00bc I(f), due to the periodicity of the coupling EM(f). Notice that the Josephson current is 4\u03c0 periodic, even though the Hamiltonian Heff is 2\u03c0 periodic due to gauge invariance. This apparent contradiction is resolved when one realizes that the fermion parity eigenstates 0j i and 1j i are not invariant under the gauge transformation f ! f\u00fe 2\u03c0, which indeed flips\nJ.

Therefore, the 4\u03c0 periodicity of the Josephson current is a direct consequence of fermion parity conservation.\nThe doubling of the current\u2013phase periodicity can be understood again as the effect of fractionalization: in the trivial phase, the Josephson current is carried by Cooper pairs (with charge 2e); in the nontrivial phase, the current is carried by the Majorana modes localized at the junctions, with each one being \u201chalf\u201d the degree of freedom of an electron. In the AC Josephson junction setup (voltage-driven junction), the doubling of the phase periodicity corresponds to the halving of the frequency of the Josephson current,149 which is now \u03c9J=2 \u00bc eV= h. The halving of the Josephson frequency can be probed by measuring the microwave radiation of the junction,157,159\u2013161 the current noise spectrum,157,158 or from the doubling of the width of the Shapiro steps in the nontrivial phase153,154,157,158,162,163 when the junction is driven by a current with both DC and AC components (induced by microwave radiation). Other signatures of the topological phase transition are the discontinuities in the derivatives of the Josephson critical current,513,514 the discontinuous jumps in the current\u2013 phase relation,515\u2013517 and the presence of nonzero Josephson current at f \u00bc 0 when the magnetic field has a finite component by . 0 in the direction of the spin\u2013orbit coupling field. 515,516"

The superconducting phases of the left and right sides of the junction can be absorbed by the gauge transformation defined by cn ! e ifL=2cn for n \u00bc 1, . . . , N and cn ! e ifR=2cn for n \u00bc N \u00fe 1, . . . , 2N , which gives\nH \u00bc X2N n\u00bc1 \u03bccyncn XN 1 n\u00bc1 tcyncn\u00fe1 \u0394cncn\u00fe1 \u00fe h:c:\nX2N 1 n\u00bcN tcyncn\u00fe1 \u0394cncn\u00fe1 \u00fe h:c: tJ eif=2cyNcN\u00fe1 \u00fe h:c: , (137)\nwhere f \u00bc fL fR is the phase difference across the junction. As\none can see from the equation above, this phase cannot be gauged away (it is gauge invariant), and thus the energy levels of the Hamiltonian will depend explicitly on f. In the nontrivial phase j\u03bcj , 2t, and if the two sides of the junction are completely decoupled tJ \u00bc 0, each side exhibit Majorana zero modes localized at the boundaries, i.e., at the lattice sites n \u00bc 1 and n \u00bc N (left side) and n \u00bc N \u00fe 1 and n \u00bc 2N (right side). In the Majorana chain regime with \u0394 \u00bc t and \u03bc \u00bc 0 [see Eq. (47)], the Majorana modes are fully localized and described by the operators\ndL \u00bc 12 (\u03b3B,N i\u03b3A,1), (138a)\ndR \u00bc 12 (\u03b3B,2N i\u03b3A,N\u00fe1), (138b)\nas in Eq. (48). For tJ = 0, the Majorana modes localized at n \u00bc N and n \u00bc N \u00fe 1 hybridize via tunneling, inducing a finite energy splitting between the modes. Since the Majorana zero modes at n \u00bc 1 and n \u00bc 2N are not affected, this regime is described by an effective Hamiltonian Heff obtained by projecting on the Majorana modes \u03b3B,N and \u03b3A,N\u00fe1, i.e., by taking cN \u00bc (\u03b3A,N \u00fe i\u03b3B,N )=2 ! i\u03b3B,N=2 and cN\u00fe1 \u00bc (\u03b3A,N\u00fe1 \u00fe i\u03b3B,N\u00fe1)=2 ! \u03b3A,N\u00fe1=2 in Eq.

Eq. (49)]. The Hamiltonian above, which is analogous to Eq. (134) when EM(f) \u00bc tJcos(f=2), has two energy eigenvalues that are also eigenvalues of the number operator. The state 0j i has even fermion parity and energy (tJ=2)cos(f=2), while the state 1j i has odd fermion parity with opposite energy (tJ=2)cos(f=2). Even though the Hamiltonian Heff is 2\u03c0 periodic, the energies of the two eigenstates are 4\u03c0 periodic. Indeed, the gauge transformation f ! f\u00fe 2\u03c0 flips both the fermion parity and the sign of the energy eigenvalues, leaving the Hamiltonian Heff unchanged. The energies of the two states cross at zero energy for f \u00bc +\u03c0: However, transitions between the two states are suppressed by fermion parity conservation. Using Eq. (133), the contributions to the Josephson current of the two states are given by\nI(f) \u00bc etJ 2 h sin f 2 2nM 1\u00f0 \u00de, (140)\nwhich is 4\u03c0 periodic in the phase f.

Therefore, the nontrivial contributions are larger than trivial ones in tunnel junctions TN 1.\nJ. Appl. Phys. 132, 231101 (2022); doi: 10.1063/5.0102999 132, 231101-38\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2022\n18 January 2024 22:46:27\nEquations (139) and (140) have been derived using the Kitaev model in the Majorana chain regime in Eq. (47), i.e., assuming that the Majorana edge modes are perfectly localized at a single lattice site with a localization length \u03beM \u00bc 0. One can expect these equations to be valid, up to exponentially small corrections, also in the case of finite Majorana localization lengths \u03beM. Furthermore, since the low energy sector of the Oreg\u2013Lutchyn Hamiltonian is equivalent to a spinless p-wave superconductor (as discussed in Sec. IV B 4), these results are still valid in the case of Josephson junctions realized by Majorana nanowires, as long as the Majorana localization length \u03beM is small compared with the wire length.\nFigures 16(c) and 16(d) show the energy levels and Josephson current as a function of the phase f. At f \u00bc 0, there is a finite energy splitting between the two states 0j i and 1j i, with energies E \u00bc +tJ=2, respectively, while the Josephson current carried by both states is zero. For f . 0, the energy splitting between the two states decreases and becomes degenerate at zero energy for f \u00bc \u03c0, while the current reaches the maximum values I \u00bc +Ic \u00bc +etJ=2 h. Consequently, for f . \u03c0, the energy splitting increases again, and at f \u00bc 2\u03c0, the energies of the two states 0j i and 1j i become E \u00bc +tJ=2, respectively, while the current becomes zero. Hence, an adiabatic evolution of the phase from f \u00bc 0 to f \u00bc 2\u03c0 does not bring back to the initial configuration: The energies of the two states at f \u00bc 2\u03c0 are inverted, and the initial configuration is reached only when f \u00bc 4\u03c0. The crossing of the two energy levels is protected by fermion parity conservation: Since the states 0j i and 1j i have different fermion parity, transitions between the two states violate parity conservation. Therefore, even when the two states are degenerate at f \u00bc +\u03c0, the transition between the two states is strongly suppressed. Hence, if fermion parity is conserved, the Josephson current is 4\u03c0 periodic in the phase.\nIn realistic systems, a direct probe of the 4\u03c0 periodicity of the Josephson current is rather hard to achieve: Spatially separated Majorana modes have a finite, although exponentially small, overlap. If the Majorana delocalization length is comparable with the length of the wire, this residual overlap cannot be neglected. In this case, the effect of the Majorana modes localized away from the junction, neglected in Eq. (134), has to be taken into account. This results in the hybridization of the Majorana modes with a finite energy splitting / e L=\u03beM , where L is the distance between contiguous Majorana modes. This energy splitting produces an avoided crossing of the two energy sectors of Eq. (139) at f \u00bc \u03c0 restoring the 2\u03c0 periodicity of the Josephson current in finite systems.151,155,156,518\u2013520 The total fermion parity of the Majorana modes at the junction and away from the junction is still conserved: However, the avoided crossing breaks the parity conservation of the two inner Majorana modes at the junction. Another process that breaks fermion parity conservation and restores the 2\u03c0 periodicity is quasiparticle-poisoning.48,336\u2013338 For this reason, experimental probes of the fractional Josephson effect need to be performed by sweeping the phase f on time scales shorter than the quasiparticle poisoning time \u03c4QP. On the other hand, rapidly changing the phase f breaks adiabaticity and drives the junction out of equilibrium. This may result in nonadiabatic (Landau-Zener) transitions to higher energy levels with the same fermion parity,155,156,521 which may produce 4\u03c0 periodicity even in topologically trivial regimes."

Let us consider a Majorana nanowire in a floating setup, i.e., isolated from the ground, connected to two metallic leads with a bias voltage V, and with an applied gate voltage VG, as shown schematically in Fig. 17(a). In this setup, known as \u201cMajorana island,\u201d the strong Coulomb repulsion between electrons becomes the dominant energy scale, and electron tunneling is energetically unfavorable. Consequently, the tunneling conductance is strongly suppressed at small temperatures and small bias voltages. In the constant interaction model, one assumes that the total energy due to the Coulomb repulsions of the electrons in the nanowire only depends on the total charge. This energy contribution is equal to the electrostatic energy Q2=2C \u00bc e2N2=2C, where Q \u00bc eN \u00bc e(Ne Ni) is the excess electronic charge, given by the sum between the ionic charge eNi and the bare electronic charge eNe, N \u00bc Ne Ni the number of excess electrons, and C the total capacitance of the wire. Hence, the energy required to add one electron to a neutral system, i.e., the so-called charging energy, is given by EC \u00bc e2=2C. If one applies a finite voltage VG by gating, the total energy of the island gains an additional term eNVG, due to the Coulomb repulsion between the excess electronic charge and the gate charge eNG \u00bc CVG. The sum of the electrostatic energy due to Coulomb repulsion between the excess charges e2N2=2C \u00bc ECN2 and between the excess charges and gate charge eNVG \u00bc 2ECNNG amounts to the total energy of the island in the normal (i.e., nonsuperconducting) phase, given by\nE(N) \u00bc EC(N NG)2, (141)\nup to terms not depending on N. In the superconducting phase, the total energy acquires an extra term that depends on the fermion parity of the condensate.

In this regime, the lowest single-particle energy level available is the Majorana bound state, \u0394E \u00bc EM / e L=\u03beM , which is exponentially small in the wire length L. If the Majorana localization length is much shorter than the wire length \u03beM L, one has that \u0394E \u00bc EM 0. In this case, the conductance peaks at the degeneracy points given by\neNG \u00bc e N \u00fe 12\nfor N [ Z, (147)\nas follows from Eq. (146) by taking \u0394E \u00bc 0. Hence, the Coulomb blockade peaks are now evenly spaced and periodic in the gate charge with periodicity e. The Coulomb blockade peaks correspond to the tunneling in and out of the two spatially separated Majorana modes at the opposite ends of the island, which effectively amounts to the tunneling through a single fermionic state, i.e., the Majorana bound states formed by the combination of the two Majorana modes. This single-electron tunneling process thus corresponds to a peak with a maximum height quantized to G \u00bc G0=2 \u00bc e2=h164,166 in the limit of large charging energies EC, which is half the conductance of the resonant zero-bias peak through a Majorana mode in the noninteracting case discussed in Sec. VA. Remarkably, this tunneling of single electrons mediated by the Majorana zero modes through two opposite terminals is independent of the length of the Majorana island, i.e., independent of the distance between the spatially separated Majorana modes. Hence, this process is referred to as \u201cteleportation.\u201d Figure 17(d) shows the energies of the many-particle states for \u0394E \u00bc 0 and the corresponding degeneracy points of energy levels with different fermion parity. The spacing between consecutive peaks with even and odd fermion parity is e, i.e., the peaks are periodic in the gate charge eNG with period e, as in Fig. 17(e) for \u0394E=EC \u00bc 0. Therefore, at the topological phase transition, the Coulomb blockade peaks suddenly split, and their periodicity changes from 2e in the trivial phase [as in Eq. (144)] to e in the trivial phase [as in\nEq. (147)].

The halving of the period of the peaks is thus a direct signature of the presence of a Majorana bound state at zero energy and a direct probe of its nonlocal nature. Furthermore, in short wires, i.e., with a length comparable to the Majorana localization length \u03beM L, the energy \u0394E \u00bc EM . 0 is not negligible. In this regime, the Coulomb peaks are not evenly spaced but follow a periodic pattern with periodicity 2e described by Eq. (146), where the fermion parity depends on the occupation number of the Majorana bound state nM, being P \u00bc ( 1)N \u00bc ( 1)nM . Therefore, the spacing between consecutive peaks can be used to measure the Majorana energy splitting EM and the oscillations of the Majorana energy,168 providing an estimate of the localization length \u03beM via Eq.

Similar devices were used in the following zero-bias peaks experiments on InAs/Al,171 InSb/Nb,172 InAs/NbN,173 InSb/ Ti/NbTiN174 nanowires, and Coulomb blockade spectroscopy in InSb/Nb189 devices. Common issues of these early experiments were the zero-bias peak being much lower than the theoretically predicted quantized value and the presence of a so-called soft gap, i.e., a finite conductance below the superconducting gap even at zero magnetic fields, indicating the presence of spurious quasiparticle states near zero energy.\nAn engineering breakthrough came in 2015 with the development of a new fabrication technique where a superconducting thin film is epitaxially grown on the surface of hexagonal nanowires,529 as in Fig. 10(c). This led to a second generation of hybrid InAs/ Al,387,529 InSb/NbTiN,388,389 and InSb/Al193 nanowire devices. Due to an epitaxially clean and homogeneous superconducting\u2013semiconducting interface, these partially covered nanowires exhibit hard gaps,387\u2013389 i.e., a very low conductance below the superconducting gap with a strong suppression of quasiparticle states near zero energy, in contrast with earlier experiments. Crucially, this led to more convincing experimental signatures, e.g., resolving separate trivial and nontrivial regions in the phase diagram in InSb/ NbTiN,177,179 larger zero-bias peaks in InSb/Al185 devices, a direct observation of the nonlocality of Majorana bound states via tunneling spectroscopy with a quantum dot in InAs/Al nanowires,176,178 the fractional Josephson effect via the Josephson radiation frequency in InAs/Al nanowire-based junctions.188 Other signatures were provided by Coulomb blockade spectroscopy in isolated InAs/ Al190\u2013192,194,530 and InSb/Al193 Majorana islands. A second breakthrough was the fabrication of multiterminal devices in InAs/ Al181\u2013183,531 and InSb/Al184 nanowires. This setup allows to directly probe the nonlocal signatures of Majorana bound states by investigating the presence of zero-bias peaks at both ends of the wire,182\u2013184,531 measuring the full conductance matrix182,183 and simultaneously detecting the closing and reopening of the topological gap.181,183\nJ.

These devices present several advantages: The full-shell covering protects the wire from surface impurities and, moreover, the topological phase may be reached at relatively low magnetic fields. Signatures of Majorana bound states in InAs/Al full-shell nanowires at low magnetic fields have been reported via tunneling and Coulomb blockade spectroscopy.71 However, these Majorana bound states may not be fully topologically protected against the mixing between subbands with different angular momenta, which arise when considering realistic experimental conditions, such as broken axial symmetry (e.g., due to the hexagonal section of the wire) and interface disorder.72 Another possible issue is that the spin\u2013orbit coupling induced in the wire may be rather small, requiring a finetuning of the nanowire radius to reach the topologically nontrivial phase.532 Moreover, these systems may also present zero-bias peaks unrelated to topological superconductivity.533,534\nAnother promising setup is realized by hexagonal nanowires epitaxially covered by both superconducting and ferromagnetic layers, as in InAs/EuS/Al hybrid nanowire devices,535,536 shown in Fig. 10(e). In these doubly covered nanowires, the time-reversal symmetry is broken by the exchange field induced by proximity with the ferromagnetic insulator,59,60 allowing for the emergence of a stable zero-bias peak at zero applied magnetic field, as observed in a recent experiment.426\nOther 1D platforms that exhibit signatures compatible with the presence of Majorana bound states are metallic nanowire heterostructures537 and effectively 1D systems obtained in 2D semiconductor\u2013superconductor planar heterostructures484,538\u2013540 or in proximitized topological insulators (HgTe).541\u2013544\nVery recently, evidence of a topologically nontrivial phase and Majorana bound states have been reported in an InAs/Al hybrid device, where a 1D quantum wire has been obtained by deposition of a narrow strip of Al over an InAs quantum well545 in a three-terminal setup.451,492\u2013494 As a first step, the experiment determined the regions of the parameter space where zero-bias peaks occur at both ends of the wire by measuring the local conductances at both ends. As a second step, the full local and nonlocal conductance matrix was measured in these regions, including the nonlocal cross-conductance between the two ends, as a function of the applied magnetic field and gate voltage. Since the nonlocal conductance can reveal the closing and reopening of the bulk gap, this two-step protocol allows finding the regions of the parameter space with zero-bias peaks at both ends of the wire, which are stable for a reasonably extended range of the applied magnetic field, and which appear after the closing and reopening of the bulk gap. Ideally, these regions correspond to the nontrivial phases of the device, where the bulk is gapped with stable Majorana bound states. As claimed by the authors,494 this procedure removes the subjectivity and the possible biases in the experimental search and reduces possible mistakes in the identification of Majorana bound states which, however, cannot be ruled out completely."

Indeed, many of the reported signatures may have alternative explanations, including zerobias Kondo resonances,196 disorder,197\u2013199,400,427,429,446\u2013452,558 localized impurities,401,450 strong interband coupling,199,453 or finite-size effects,454 which may produce zero-energy or near zero-energy modes even in the topologically trivial phase. In particular, subgap Andreev modes221 may appear as zero or near-zero energy excitations in the trivial phase induced by smooth potentials, accidental quantum dots, partial proximization of the nanowire, finite-size effects, or disorder,146,195,197,198,265,399\u2013401,429,433,436\u2013439,446\u2013452,452\u2013463,463\u2013468,485, 486,559\u2013561 not necessarily localized at opposite ends and with experimental signatures which may mimic those of Majorana bound states.175,531,533,534,554,562\u2013570 These modes, known as quasi-Majorana bound states, trivial Majorana bound states, partially separated or partially overlapping Majorana bound states, materialize as a superposition of a pair of Majorana modes, partially separated in space but with a sizable overlap, typically appearing without a sharp quantum phase transition.146,400,434\u2013436,468 However, whereas Majorana bound states are exponentially localized at the nanowire ends, quasi-Majorana bound states are typically localized near inhomogeneities or impurities and do not necessarily exhibit exponential localization.437,438,452,456,457 Note that the Majorana modes forming a quasi-Majorana bound state may still have a large degree of separation with a small overlap and almost zero energy437,439 and, in this case, exhibit a full Majorana character, being self-adjoint and particle\u2013hole symmetric with nonabelian braiding statistics.439,571 Indeed, there exists a smooth crossover between quasi-Majorana bound states and Majorana bound states in nonuniform nanowires.438,439,450,456,457,468,561 In this case, subgap states typically detach from the bulk excitation spectrum and gradually approach zero energy without a sharp topological phase transition.146,400,434\u2013436,468 Another source of zero-energy states in topologically trivial nanowires is the coupling to external reservoirs (e.g., metallic leads, gates), which may induce the presence of exceptional points in the nonhermitian complex energy spectrum456,572 (see Ref. 221).\nIn light of the above, stronger evidence of topologicallynontrivial Majorana modes has been provided by the observation of their nonlocal signatures in the differential conductance in\nJ.

As mentioned, evidence of Majorana bound states has been reported in an InAs/Al hybrid device in a three-terminal setup,545 by mapping the regions of the parameter space where zero-bias peaks appear at both ends of the system with the concurrent opening and closing of the bulk gap. Other conductance signatures of Majorana bound states may be obtained by suppressing the contribution of trivial Andreev bound states to the differential conductance via dissipative leads,500,501 as in a recent experiment,186 measuring the half-integer plateaus in the quantum point contact conductance in the ballistic regime,148 or probing the tunneling current through superconducting leads502 or spin-polarized leads.472,503\u2013505 Direct evidence may also be obtained by probing the spin degree of freedom of Majorana modes,147,320,472,497,498,503\u2013505 their nonlocality,147,480,495,499,573,575\u2013577 and by quantifying their lifetimes, coherence times,336,574 and degree of mutual overlap.431,437,573 Another approach is to directly probe the signatures of the topological phase transition,63,434,435,497 e.g., in the Josephson critical current90,410,513,514 or spin susceptibility,578 as experimentally measured in Majorana nanowire junctions579 and planar Josephson junctions,540 or the fermion parity anomaly in the Coulomb blockade regime.526 Further evidence may be provided by the interplay between Kondo and Majorana physics580,581 or signatures of the topological Kondo effect stemming from the coupling between conduction electrons and the nonlocal Majorana bound state.582\u2013586 Ideally, only the experimental observation on the same sample of multiple, independent, and mutually consistent signatures on a reasonably large parameter range may prove beyond reasonable doubt the existence of Majorana bound states in Majorana nanowires,227 e.g., by performing both tunneling and Coulomb spectroscopy on the same device.71,534 For an overview of the recent experimental advances in the field, see Refs. 222, 224, 225, and 227\u2013230.\nThe next milestones in the route to topological quantum computation with Majorana modes are the experimental demonstration of their nonabelian braiding statistics and the realization of scalable architectures employing Majorana-based topological qubits298,303,304 in networks of Majorana nanowires.42,279,280,284,295,296,298,302\u2013305 A first indirect demonstration of the nonabelian statistics may be achieved by verifying the fusion rules by measuring the fermion parity of the qubit during a fusion experiment.298,303,325\u2013329 A more direct demonstration of nonabelian braiding instead requires the adiabatical exchange of the Majorana modes in physical space42,279,280,286 or in parameter space,284,285,294\u2013298 or by measurement-only approaches via projective measurements of the fermion parity.299\u2013304 Nevertheless, braiding alone cannot realize universal quantum computation in a fully topological-protected way: Majorana qubits need to be complemented by auxiliary topologically unprotected quantum operations.298,304,305,312,314\u2013322 Furthermore, even the topological-protected braidings of Majorana modes are still prone to decoherence due to quasiparticle poisoning336\u2013338,440\u2013445 and nonadiabatic processes.287\u2013289,330\u2013335\nHence, to implement fault-tolerant quantum computation, Majorana-based qubits still need to be supplemented by quantum error correction codes.347,349\u2013353,587\nIt is worth mentioning that the relevance of Majorana modes and topological superconductors goes well beyond their immediate applications in the field of topological quantum computing described here. For example, the realization of hybrid Majorana-transmon qubits296,297,588\u2013592 may have an impact in the field of superconducting quantum computing, where qubits are implemented through superconducting circuits (see Ref. 240). Moreover, the braiding of Majorana modes and the corresponding topological quantum gates can be mapped into the time evolutions of a quantum simulator realized, e.g., by trapped ions, ultracold atoms, superconducting circuits, or photonic systems, as in recent experiments.593,594 Finally, the experimental and theoretical effort to realize Majorana modes may lead to the development of more advanced platforms for topological quantum computation: Parafermions, a generalization of Majorana fermions may provide a larger set of fully topologically protected quantum gates, as opposed to topological Majorana qubits595\u2013603 (see Refs. 604\u2013606 for a review). On top of this, Majorana modes may be employed as building blocks of strongly interacting models such as Kitaev spin models,607,608 the topologically ordered Majorana toric code,342\u2013346 and other stabilizer and error-correcting codes,347\u2013353 which could lead to fault-tolerant topological quantum computation.39,45,307\nBeyond quantum computation, Majorana modes are also relevant for studying supersymmetric theories in condensed matter, in particular emergent space-time supersymmetry609\u2013613 and emergent quantum-mechanical supersymmetry.141,261\u2013263 Finally, the Sachdev\u2013Ye\u2013Kitaev model,614\u2013617 realized by a collection of Majorana modes with infinite-range (i.e., one-to-all) many-body interactions with random couplings, has been studied in connection with strongly correlated non-Fermi liquids, quantum manybody chaos, quantum gravity, and black holes physics (see Ref. 618 for a review).\nThe route from theoretical models to experiments and from experiments to technological applications will hopefully lead to the design of viable technological platforms for topological quantum computation, which will constitute a breakthrough in quantum information science and simultaneously contribute to fundamental advances in understanding quantum physics."

If z \u00bc z+, the first diagonal element is zero, while the second is nonzero, and therefore the solutions of the eigenvalue equation in Eq. (C7) are the vectors [\u03b1, \u03b2]/ [1, 0]. If z \u00bc 1=z+, conversely, the second diagonal element is zero and the first is nonzero, and therefore the solutions of the eigenvalue equation are [\u03b1, \u03b2]/ [0, 1]. Therefore, there are two orthogonal zero-energy solutions given by\n\u03c8An \u00bc A\u00fe zn\u00fe \u00fe A zn 1\n0\n, (C10a)\n\u03c8Bn \u00bc B\u00fe z n\u00fe \u00fe B z n 0\n1\n, (C10b)\nwhere the coefficients B+ and A+ need to be determined by the boundary conditions in Eq.

In this case, the boundary conditions \u03c8B0 \u00bc 0 and \u03c8AN\u00fe1 \u00bc 0 can be satisfied in the limit N ! 1, whereas the boundary conditions \u03c8BN\u00fe1 \u00bc 0 and \u03c8A0 \u00bc 0 give B\u00fez N 1\u00fe \u00bc B z N 1 and A\u00fe \u00bc A ,\nrespectively. Taking A\u00fe \u00bc A \u00bc B\u00fez N 1\u00fe \u00bc B z N 1 , one gets\n\u03c8An \u00bc 1 Z zn\u00fe zn 1 0 , (C11a)\n\u03c8Bn \u00bc 1 Z zN\u00fe1 n\u00fe zN\u00fe1 n 0 1 , (C11b)\nwhere 1=Z is a normalization factor. In the particle\u2013hole basis, these wavefunctions yield Eq. (52). These zero-energy modes correspond to two Majorana end modes localized at the opposite ends of the chain in Eq. (55). In the Majorana chain regime \u0394 \u00bc t, one has that z\u00fe \u00bc 0 or z \u00bc 0 and formally can substitute z0+ ! 1 in the above equations for n \u00bc 0, formally recovering the open boundary conditions in Eq. (C6).\nIn order to obtain the zero-energy modes in Eq. (C11) satisfying the boundary conditions in Eq. (C6), one needs to assume that jz\u00fej, jz j , 1. In this case, indeed, the boundary conditions in Eq. (C6) are satisfied for N ! 1, and approximately up to exponentially small terms for N , 1. I will now show that this assumption is equivalent to assuming that j\u03bcj , 2t. This will guarantee the existence of the Majorana end modes. First, we start to notice that Eq. (C9) mandates that at least one of the two solutions z+ is smaller than one, i.e., one has z\u00fe , 1 or z , 1, or both jz\u00fej, jz j , 1. If only one solution is larger than one, i.e., jz\u00fej . 1 or jz\u00fej . 1, then \u03c8Bn and \u03c8An are both a sum of an exponentially increasing and exponentially decreasing component. For this reason, they cannot satisfy the boundary conditions, not even approximately. Let us consider separately the cases where z+ in Eq. (C8) are real and distinct [i.e., \u03bc2 . 4(t2 \u03942)], real and degenerate [i.e., \u03bc2 \u00bc 4(t2 \u03942)], or complex conjugates [i.e., \u03bc2 , 4(t2 \u03942)]. If z+ are complex conjugate numbers, i.e., for \u03bc2 , 4(t2 \u03942) , (2t)2, Eq. (C9) mandates jz\u00fez j \u00bc jz\u00fej2 \u00bc jz j2 , 1. If z+ are real numbers instead, i.e., for \u03bc2 . 4(t2 \u03942), Eq. (C9) mandates jz\u00fez j \u00bc jz\u00fekz j , 1. In order to have both jz\u00fej , 1 and jz j , 1, one may impose (jz\u00fej2 1)(jz j2 1) \u00bc (4t2 \u03bc2)=(t \u00fe \u0394)2 . 0. Thus, one has jz\u00fej, jz j , 1 if j\u03bcj , 2t. In the limiting case \u03bc2 \u00bc 4(t2 \u03942), the two real roots are degenerate z\u00fe \u00bc z , and the zero-energy modes \u03c8An and \u03c8 B n can be obtained by taking the limit \u03bc ! + ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 4(t2 \u03942) p . Hence, whether z+ are real or complex numbers, one has jz\u00fej, jz j , 1 as long as j\u03bcj , 2t. In this case, the Hamiltonian allows the existence of Majorana modes localized at the ends of the chain. On the other hand, for j\u03bcj . 2t, one has jz\u00fej . 1 or jz j . 1. In this case, there are no zero-energy end modes. Finally, at the closing of the particle\u2013hole gap j\u03bcj \u00bc 2t, one has either jz\u00fej \u00bc 1 or jz j \u00bc 1. In this case, the zero-energy modes \u03c8An and \u03c8 B n become extended along the whole chain.

For this reason, it is useful to perform a change of basis into the Nambu spinor \u03a8y(k) \u00bc [\u03a8y\"(k), \u03a8y#(k), \u03a8#( k), \u03a8\"( k)] via the unitary transformation U \u00bc diag(1, i\u03c3y) which yields\n1 0\n0 i\u03c3y\nh(k) \u0394i\u03c3y \u0394i\u03c3y h( k)* \" # 1 0 0 i\u03c3y y\n\u00bc h(k) \u0394 \u0394 \u03c3yh( k)*\u03c3y , (D2)\nwhich gives Eq. (92). The symmetry operators in the new Nambu basis in Eq. (106) are obtained from Eq. (105) via the unitary transformation defined above. Notice that the time-reversal symmetry operator T \u00bc i\u03c3yK is not affected by the change of basis."
