This study first manipulated relevant subjects\u2019 experimental materials through a contextual experiment and used a one-way ANOVA to test the effects of competence stereotypes and occupational stereotypes on hotel interns\u2019 stigma perceptions, respectively, and then used partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) as a statistical tool and the SmartPLS 3.0 program to validate the model of hotel interns\u2019 occupational stigma perceptions-intention. The effects of both competence stereotypes and occupational stereotypes on hotel interns\u2019 perceptions of occupational stigma were significant. The results of the partial least squares structural equation model showed that hotel interns\u2019 perceptions of occupational stigma significantly contributed to emotional exhaustion and that emotional exhaustion significantly influenced hotel interns\u2019 retention willingness, hotel interns\u2019 perceptions of occupational stigma had a significant effect on their retention willingness, while the role of emotional exhaustion as a mediating variable and occupational commitment as a moderator. The inner psychological and behavioral linkage mechanisms of hotel interns\u2019 occupational stigma perceptions and their retention willingness under COVID-19 were explored, and the resource dynamics operating mechanism and professional commitment were also confirmed.\nKeywords: occupational stigma theory, social learning theory, retention willingness, emotional exhaustion, organizational behavior\nINTRODUCTION\nThe impact of COVID-19 on the hotel hospitality industry is incalculable, and hotels suffer from the lower numbers of guests and the challenges of human resource retention. Hotel demand for human resource planning and management has increased. For the hospitality industry, interns are a positive addition to the workforce, and a focus on interns as new human capital reduces labor\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 1 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 798526\ncosts for hotels and provides an organizational framework for building talent pipelines within hotels. Existing research has focused on generation Z as the largest proportion of hospitality workers, and studies have suggested that the existing hospitality research needs to address the changing workforce (Solnet et al., 2016), Moreover, the survival of the hospitality industry is highly dependent on a stable source of labor in the face of traditionally high and constant turnover rates and a shrinking labor market, there is a need to attract the next generation of hospitality talent (Goh and Okumus, 2020). Therefore, in the long term the hotel intern segment provides the opportunity and resource pool to observe, assess, and select regular employes. However, existing studies have shown the high turnover rate of hotel interns is a long-term challenge for the global hospitality industry, and the loss of interns increases the cost of COVID-19 human resource planning and employes\u2019 output effectiveness in the hospitality industry. Consequently, this is detrimental to the optimization and implementation of human resource management and planning. Existing studies have conducted empirical research related to influencing factors on hotel interns\u2019 turnover, indicating aspects like negative emotions and job stress from perceived occupational stigma can lead to low job performance and high turnover intentions among interns (Hobfoll, 1989; Pinel and Paulin, 2005). Related studies have highlighted the role of emotional exhaustion in individual turnover (Hobfoll, 2001), and more studies have explored the potential of organizational resources and occupational commitment to reduce burnout and turnover from a positive organizational behavior perspective (Blau, 1985; Chang, 1999; Cuyper et al., 2012). Existing stigma studies have empirically studied and analyzed disease stigma using COVID19 as a lens, involving both health and non-health workers (Anda\u00e7 Demirtas\u0327-Madran, 2020; Mostafa et al., 2020) but interns, who are hospitality reservists, encountering front-line work in occupational stigma research has been neglected, and as a typical representative of non-health workers, existing stigma research needs to expand knowledge on occupational stigma research based on organizational behavior (Ramaci et al., 2021) to hotel interns who are not health workers but perform service output at high frequencies and lack a protection system.\nExisting research approaches have also explored factors associated with human resource attrition in hotels concerning quantitative causal mechanism exploration and diverse influence pathways, as well as qualitative exploratory studies. However, existing research has overlooked the importance of hotel interns as a scarce resource in the hospitality industry and as individual resources in terms of talent management (Goh and Okumus, 2020). Thunnissen (2016) showed the complexity of the \u201cblack box\u201d of hospitality industry talent management because it encourages research on the multiple levels and stakeholders involved in talent management. Thus, exploring hotel interns\u2019 willingness to stay combines micro psychology and behavior from a positive psychology perspective where the public perspective becomes the starting point and focus of this study. Based on this, this study integrates resource retention theory and social learning theory to explore the inner mechanism of resource dynamics and the contextual interaction of social learning among hotel interns. Although few studies have examined hotel\ninterns\u2019 willingness to stay as a resource path for hotel human resource planning and development, this study attempts to reveal the micro-operational processes of hotel interns\u2019 resources through the perspectives of positive organizational behavior and social psychology.\nTherefore, the specific objectives of this study are as follows:\n1. Determine how the intrinsic influence mechanism between hotel interns\u2019 perceived career stigma and willingness to stay allocates and optimizes resources through the integration of resource conservation theory and social learning theory. 2. Explore the boundary condition mechanisms of different occupational stigma and emotional exhaustion levels by introducing occupational commitment as a moderating variable. 3. Taking a public perspective, determine the antecedent intrinsic influences on hotel interns\u2019 perceptions of occupational stigma.\nTo address the above groundbreaking research objectives, this study combines a contextual experimental approach and quantitative analysis of causal mechanisms. These are used to validate a career stigma perception intention to stay model based on a theoretical framework integrating resource conservation theory and social learning theory. The results will inform management and internship effectiveness enhancement decisions in the post-COVID-19 hospitality industry. Moreover, it will provide a micro-behavioral and psychological theoretical reference framework for hotel interns to achieve resource selfenhancement, career planning, and psychological adjustment in the workplace from the perspective of human capital and psychological capital."

            "text": "Resource conservation theory originates from stress theory, which focuses on physiological, psychological, and behavioral responses, and the most representative ones are the processoriented stress and environmental equilibrium models (McGrath, 1976). However, the process-oriented stress model has three significant limitations. It does not provide a clear definition of individual needs and resource capacity, it does not provide a mechanistic explanation of the relationship between the two aspects, and it does not provide a standardized tool for comparing individual needs and resource capacity (Xu et al., 2021a,b). Therefore, resource conservation theory can better explain and reveal individual behavior in stressful situations (Dohrenwend and Dohrenwend, 1978). Conceptually, Hobfoll (1989) defined resources as individual characteristics, conditioned energy, and other things that make individuals feel valued, such as material resources, conditioned resources, personality traits, and energy resources. Lee and Ashforth (1996) further found that resources satisfy individual needs, and also help them in self-identification and social orientation. On the other\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 798526\nhand, Arkin (1981) found resources have two spiral effects, the loss spiral and the value-added spiral, and thus resource conservation theory extends three theoretical corollaries: the primacy of resource conservation (Arkin, 1981). The secondary importance of resource acquisition and the creation of resource surpluses by individuals (Kobasa, 1979; Kobasa and Courington, 1981). Existing research perspectives are developed based on work situations, and in terms of resource depletion from the perspective of occupational demands. Brotheridge and Lee (2002) found that employes\u2019 occupational demands cause resource imbalance and employes require significant internal resources for emotional regulation. Additionally, environmental factors and management styles can disrupt employes\u2019 individual resource balance, leading to emotional depletion (Cuyper et al., 2012), It has also been shown that a lack of adequate resources (personality traits, social relationships, etc.) can lead to emotional exhaustion and affect performance (Buchwald, 2010; Barnetta et al., 2012). Some scholars have also empirically investigated resource conservation theory from the perspective of individual traits and resources. Starting with an empirical exploration of resource conservation theory, recent studies confirmed the association between individual resource characteristics and job burnout (Cordes and Dougherty, 1993); while Neil and Christopher (2012) found that individual psychological values can influence one\u2019s resource evaluations and this influences the individual\u2019s response to stressors. Wright and Bonett (1997) highlighted the importance of psychological well-being as a positive emotional resource, demonstrating a positive relationship between psychological well-being and performance. Hobfoll (2001) highlighted that people with more primal psychological resources have a greater ability to release stress. In summary, resource preservation theory reveals the psychological motivation of individuals to preserve, acquire, and utilize resources through the dynamic process of a resource\u2019s intrinsic mechanism, adding new paths for the resource depletion and gain perspective to solve and reveal stress and emotional depletion problems (Tang et al., 2022).\nIn this study, the formation process of hotel interns\u2019 stress is analyzed from the perspective of resource flow, and the behavioral decisions of interns under limited resources, which has predictive and explanatory power and can reveal the mechanism of hotel interns\u2019 behavior and work outcomes."

            "text": "Social learning theory is derived from the reinforcement learning theory of the behaviorist school, which explores the influence of individual cognition, behavior, and environmental factors and their interaction on human behavior, as well as the role of learning and self-regulation in triggering human behavior (Bandura and Walters, 1977), which highlights that people\u2019s complex intentions and behaviors are mainly acquired, including direct and indirect knowledge (Fellnhofer, 2017). Hotel interns belong to the transitional stage from educated to working people, and they hold individual resources and processes of resource preservation and operation that are more critical in hotel work scenarios. Social learning theory emphasizes the role of hotel interns in achieving socialization, while the dynamic operational\nprocess of resources requires education to provide learning sites and knowledge (Fellnhofer, 2017). Social learning theory provides a rationale for how workplace education influences hotel interns\u2019 willingness to stay in the workplace, career commitment, and so on. The three corollaries extended by social learning theory are interactive decision, self-regulation, and self-efficacy, highlighting the factors that influence the intrinsic mechanisms of human behavior in social learning (Bandura, 1986). Therefore, in this study, the theory explains how hotel employes\u2019 perceived career stigma and willingness to stay are influenced by occupational commitment (competence), organizational resources (learning), and emotional exhaustion (affect), which are influenced by internal and external resources."

            "text": "Resource conservation theory has been systematically and adequately argued and developed from stress theory, theoretical assumptions, core ideas, corollaries, and research perspectives. There are rich research results in positive psychology and organizational behavior. However, the existing studies mainly explain the mechanism of burnout, workplace stress, and industry performance from the perspective of individual resource input-output imbalance, but the mechanism of the inner influence of the positive side of the resource value-added spiral has not been explored sufficiently. It also provides a theoretical framework for how hotel interns achieve resource integration and optimization and high-return output through the process of social learning in this study. Therefore, this study builds the theoretical integration content framework shown in Figure 1. Combining the resource cultivation in the dynamic formation process of resource preservation theory with the process in social learning theory to realize the transformation of the efficacy of the social learning process and enhance the cultivation value of the resource value-added spiral, the theoretical framework integrated in this study therefore attempts to respond to the argumentative basis of the following research questions: First, to make up for the lack of research on the intrinsic influence mechanism and dynamic decision-making process of a resource value-added spiral in existing studies; second, the research content framework after integrating social learning theory and resource conservation theory can clarify the whole process of dynamics of hotel interns\u2019 self-resource allocation; and third, to integrate the value orientation of the positive psychology perspective in resource conservation theory using three key nodes in social learning theory, such as association, reinforcement, and observation. This provides a reference basis for learning mechanisms in the acquisition, transformation, and integration of resources in the workplace for hotel interns in this study and provides a theoretical framework for the basis of the theoretical framework for the next research hypotheses."

Negative occupational stigma stereotypes are widespread across industries and tend to reduce practitioners\u2019 identity and enhance negative perceptions of their occupation (Ashforth and Kreiner, 1999; Baran et al., 2012). Existing studies on occupational stigma\u2019s antecedents, consequences, and coping strategies have received more attention and the association between occupational stigma and the propensity to leave has been clarified. Wildes (2005) found through an empirical study in the restaurant industry that occupational stigma was associated with specific job types and that the sense of stigma associated with occupational stigma was a reason practitioners left jobs. Pinel and Paulin (2005) also concluded that employes\u2019 awareness of occupational stigma would lead them to perceive a lack of respect at work and thus show a willingness to leave; Barbier et al. (2013) further identified professional stigma as an identitythreatening factor, where individuals perceive that the group they are embedded in will be exposed to the threat of a bad reputation, resulting in emotional exhaustion over time and a tendency to leave. From a resource conservation theory perspective, studies have confirmed the association between perceptions of occupational stigma and turnover intentions; it also found occupational stigma perceptions trigger individuals to protect resources, and some empirical studies focusing on occupational stigma outcomes highlight that employes who experience negative emotions and job stress from occupational stigma exhibit high job burnout, low job performance, and high turnover intentions (Hobfoll, 1989; Pinel and Paulin, 2005; Lai et al., 2013). Abel (2011) proposed from a psychological perspective that the constant vigilance and caution generated by occupational stigma contributes to employes\u2019 anxiety and fear of social interactions, which further limits social interactions in the process of dressing to avoid interpersonal resource depletion, alleviate the interpersonal pressure around them, and adopt a departure coping style. It has been established that occupational stigma has negative effects on self-concept, life satisfaction and quality of professional life, stress, willingness to stay and ego (Ramaci et al., 2020). Therefore, the following hypotheses were formulated for this study on the perceived and behavioral outcomes of occupational stigma and related interns, using hotel interns as the study population. Therefore, this study takes hotel interns as the research object and proposes the following hypotheses: H1. Hotel interns\u2019 perceived professional stigma positively influences emotional exhaustion. H2. The emotional exhaustion of hotel interns negatively influences their intention to stay in their jobs. H3. Hotel interns\u2019 perceived occupational stigma negatively influences their willingness to retain their jobs. Emotional exhaustion is a strong emotional and physiological arousal of employes in response to the great potential stress in the service industry and is also a chronic state resulting in excessive stress and depletion of employes\u2019 psycho-emotional and behavioral well-being (Lazarus et al., 1985). Existing studies have explored the inner mechanism of the emotional exhaustion process from the perspective of the dynamic consumption of resources in resource conservation theory, for example, hotels require employes to provide quality services to customers\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 4 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 798526\nwith sincere attitudes, meaning that work itself is the process of psychological resource consumption (Brotheridge and Lee, 2002), and negative customer behaviors make employes\u2019 work consumed resources go uncompensated, this further increases their work stress and eventually causes an imbalance of resources and generates emotional exhaustion (Koopmann et al., 2015). Therefore, employes face situations where customer stigma is imposed and employes must deplete their emotional resources to adopt effective self-motivation to maintain good performance (Harris and Reynolds, 2003). Further demonstrated that client misconduct and stigmatization can cause emotionally draining psychological responses such as anxiety and insomnia in frontline employes. Grandey et al. (2004) clarified that frontline employes are emotionally drained in relation to client abuse and that employes experience conflict when they are on duty. Therefore, when feeling personal resource depletion is not adequately compensated, there is a motivation to protect existing resources and compensate for depleted resources; emotional depletion is a good predictor of an individual\u2019s willingness to leave (Hobfoll, 2001). Individuals who have experienced emotional depletion will defend behaviors that may produce more resource depletion and use exit strategies to protect and maintain emotional resources (Hobfoll, 2001). In summary, based on the fact that extreme customer behavior has a positive relationship with the emotional exhaustion of frontline employes in the service industry, customer stigma imposed on employes becomes a cause of emotional exhaustion (Grandey et al., 2004). And there have been reviewed studies that have explored the changes and effects of perceived occupational stigma and individual emotions with individual-level sociological theories (Anda\u00e7 Demirtas\u0327Madran, 2020). Based on this, this study proposes the following hypothesis. Therefore, hypothesis H4 was proposed.\nH4. Emotional exhaustion presents a mediating effect between perceived occupational stigma and retention willingness in hotel internships.\nOrganizational factors play a role in coping with the negative impact of addressing customers, and effective organizational commitment reduces the impact of employes\u2019 willingness to leave (Hayes, 2013). Whereas when employes encounter negative situations where their intrinsic emotions are inconsistent with the organization\u2019s standards and they exhibit the organization\u2019s required emotional behavior, they become burdened with the highest emotional labor levels, exacerbating individual resources. Therefore, when employes lack effective resources to control their behavior, organizational resources are an important external resource and become the main form of compensation seeking. Organizational care can maintain the balance of employes\u2019 resources and increase their effectiveness in coping with negative situations, and organizational care can effectively reduce resource depletion caused by work stress or external non-organizational factors, such as negative violence, and alleviate emotional exhaustion, thus reducing the willingness to leave (Hobfoll, 2001). Cuyper et al. (2012) also found when individuals receive supportive resources from the organization, they become committed to and trusting of the organization, which reduces\nburnout and turnover. Falco et al. (2021) confirmed a stronger association between perceived risk and emotional exhaustion among employes with weak organizational commitment. Based on the reasoning of the variables in the above this study proposes the research hypothesis H5.\nH5. Professional commitment moderates the relationship of perceived occupational stigma with emotional exhaustion among hotel interns.\nProfessional commitment is an individual\u2019s attitude toward a career, the intensity of motivation to engage in a selected career and is an individual commitment to a career, distinct from job embeddedness or organizational commitment (Blau, 1985). Aryee and Tan (1992) found that high professional commitment promotes employes to improve their skills and reduces willingness to leave, while Chuang et al. (2007) showed professional commitment is an important predictor of hospitality graduates\u2019 willingness to stay as hospitality management interns. They found that when interns form a high degree of organizational socialization in hotels, they will further clarify their career plans and industry development prospects in hotels, develop a sense of identity and belong to the hospitality industry, and show a higher willingness to stay in their jobs. Ashforth et al. (1998) responded that successful organizational socialization helps employes adapt to the environment and increase their motivation and initiative: the higher the degree of socialization, the stronger the organizational identity commitment and the higher the willingness to stay. Chang (1999) verified career commitment\u2019s role in moderating the effect of employes\u2019 affective commitment on willingness to leave, while Luthans et al. (2007) suggested employes\u2019 positive psychological capital is positively related to their willingness to stay and affective commitment. Falco et al. (2021), further proposed a model for the application of the job demand-resource model to workplace safety during COVID-19, which highlights the moderating effect of occupational commitment as a job resource on employes\u2019 perceptions of emotional exhaustion and occupational expectations. Thus, hypothesis H6 was proposed.\nH6. Professional commitment moderates the relationship of emotional exhaustion with hotel interns\u2019 retention willingness.\nTherefore, this study proposes a research hypothesis framework as shown in Figure 2."

Lastly, PROCESS analysis was conducted in SPSS to examine the moderated moderation effect.\nThis study adopts PLS-SEM as a statistical tool and uses the Smart PLS3.0 program to implement the statistical process. PLS-SEM is a suitable method for data processing (Hayes and Preacher, 2013). Firstly, it is applicable to the moderation analysis and is better suited to dealing with constructs containing fewer items, even one or two (Hair et al., 2011, 2014). Secondly, it presents the advantages of mathematical computation and facilitates solving the small sample size requirement problem, which is suitable for mechanism analysis, theory exploration and validation (Ali et al., 2018). SPSS PROCESS is a more suitable method in the special case when researchers hypothesize based on theory that a path of both first and second stage in a mediation process is moderated.\nTo avoid common method bias, this study controlled for measurement items and data acquisition channels. First, it passed the Harman one-way test in SPSS 21.0, which showed that the first factor extracted explained only 33.772% of the variance, which is less than the threshold of 38.77% (Podsakoff et al., 2016). Second, following Hair et al. (2011), we examined the inner variance inflation factor (VIF) of constructs between occupational stigma perception and emotional exhaustion. The result remains 2.464, which is below 5 (Hair et al., 2011), providing information on a low level of multicollinearity. It indicates that there is unlikely to be a serious common method bias for this study."

Convenience sampling has the simplicity of sampling and convenience of research in this study, helps in research hypothesis generation, collects in a shorter period of time, and lower costs.

Moreover, R2 and path coefficients were used to explain the study model. In a PLS path model, R2 values of 0.19, 0.33, and 0.67 in a PLS path model. Chin et al. (2003) were described as weak, moderate, and substantial, respectively, by Chin (1998a, p. 323) and were associated with reflective indicators. Table 3 presents the statistical data analysis results obtained using PLS-SEM. When the factor loading of an item was <0.7, the item was deleted. This deletion led to an increase in the average variance extraction and composite reliability. The scale items S1, S2, E2, C1, and In4 were deleted because their factor loadings did not reach the specified standards.\nFor other scale items, the factor loadings were between 0.702 and 0.937. The R2 values of emotional exhaustion and retention willingness were 0.594, 0.177 respectively, which were the ideal predictive validity of the structural model.

The average variance extractions (AVE) were 0.627\u20130.732. These statistical analysis results confirm that the study model has high convergent validity. The results are presented in Table 5.\nDiscriminant Validity Fornell-Larcker criterion is used to determine discriminant validity (Fornell and Larcker, 1981), which compares the square root of AVE values with latent variable correlations. Satisfactory discriminant validity is evidenced by the square roots of AVE values being higher than inter-variable correlations. For the\ndiscriminant validity of the PLS model, the AVE value of each construct must be >0.5, and the AVE square root must be larger than the coefficient value of each construct pair (Fornell and Larcker, 1981). In our model (excluding negative emotions), all AVE values and AVE square roots satisfied the discriminant validity requirements. In addition to this, the study used the heterotrait-monotrait ratio of correlations (HTMT) criterion (Henseler et al., 2015) based on the multitrait-multimethod matrix, which is considered a stricter method to evaluate discriminant validity. According to Table 3, the largest HTMT value was 0.867, below the maximum cut-off of 0.9. The results are shown in Table 6."

If the 95% CI does not contain zero, then population conditional indirect effects differ significantly from zero at the 0.05 level (Preacher et al., 2007). In this study, a bootstrapping procedure with 5,000 iterations and 95% bias-corrected CIs was conducted using the SPSS PROCESS macro. The built-in Model 58 (see Hayes, 2013) was chosen as the base model for the moderated mediation\nmodel. The moderating effects of commitment were verified using hypotheses H5 and H6.

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "The above study found that hotels are a stressful and emotionally risky place to work. From the beginning of internship, hotel interns are faced with a change in identity and integration into the social organization, so the entire internship process and subsequent employment is a stress management process (Lazarus and Folkman, 1984). Resource conservation theory suggests that when individuals invest many resources such as time and energy, but the return is not proportional to the investment, they suffer from burnout and other negative outcomes due to the imbalance of total resources (Hobfoll, 2001). Therefore, the empirical analysis of this study confirms that emotional exhaustion as a mediating variable significantly affects the relationship between perceived career stigma and hotel interns\u2019 retention willingness, which reveals that behind the phenomenon of hotel interns\u2019 emotional exhaustion, there was potential resource loss due to clients that are demanding or bullying employes. When the client performs demanding or bullying behavior toward hotel interns and projects career stigma through career stereotypes, hotel interns will perceive a strong occupational stigma, and perceived occupational stigma consumes a lot of internal resources for emotional regulation. Over time, it gradually accumulates to form emotional depletion, which ultimately affects their willingness\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 10 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 798526\nto stay in the job due to inadequate regulation. This mediating path also demonstrated the mechanism of the influence of hotel interns\u2019 psychological resources. This study also determined that professional commitment as a moderating variable positively moderated the relationship between perceived occupational stigma, emotional exhaustion, emotional exhaustion, and retention willingness in the hotel, respectively, which further explored the internal dynamic mechanism of the resource retention theory\u2019s resource appreciation spiral. As an important organizational resource for hotel interns to form a higher degree of organizational socialization in hotels, they can continually self-replenish resources for themselves through organizational resources. Thereby they can further clarify their career planning development in hotels and develop a sense of identity and belonging to the hospitality industry, thus achieving greater resource increments and virtuous circles. Therefore, organizational commitment can activate the resource regeneration capacity held by hotel interns when they suffer from resource shortages and emotional depletion loads, driving hotel interns to achieve the value-added spiral effect, which diminishes perceptions of occupational stigma and enhances beliefs about job retention willingness. This study also revealed the moderating effects of high professional commitment on emotional exhaustion and perceived occupational stigma, respectively, and unexpected findings demonstrated that higher occupational commitment significantly reduced emotional exhaustion and diminishes hotel interns\u2019 perceptions of occupational stigma. Professional commitment is different from job embeddedness or organizational commitment, as it is an individual career commitment; it is a self-storage and accumulation of resources in the medium and long term, and it is a continuous realization of psychological capital. When hotel interns consider the existing resources invested as a supplement and reserve for their future long-term career planning, they are more motivated to invest in resources, form positive work attitudes and performance behaviors, and perceive lower levels of career stigma and a more proactive approach to dismantling extreme emotions such as emotional exhaustion through available resources, which eventually leads to a lower willingness to leave and a stronger willingness to stay at the hotel. In the process of forming high professional commitment,\nhotel interns integrate their personal attitudes, behaviors, emotions, and environmental factors to optimize and reserve resources. These interactions ultimately result in relatively weak perceptions of career stigma, stable emotions, and willingness to stay in their jobs. The mechanism of the effect of perceived career stigma on hotel interns\u2019 willingness to stay in this study echoes previous research on organizational behavior, such as in the hospitality industry, in terms of the effect of perceived occupational stigma, Kreiner and Murphy (2016) confirmed that resource shortages due to stress generated by perceived career stigma increase employes\u2019 willingness to leave, while the constant vigilance and caution generated by perceived occupational stigma motivates hotel practitioners to devote significant resources to a defensive state, further limiting normal social interactions, and they avoid interpersonal resource depletion and can only resort to leaving their jobs in response (Abel, 2011). With retention willingness level as an outcome variable, the professional commitment as a moderating variable of strong relationships proposed in this study also responds to hotel interns\u2019 career commitment in terms of career planning and willingness to stay. In reality, hotel interns self-identify as cheap labor, lower their standards, and are less motivated to work, which eventually leads to leaving the hotel industry at the end of their internship (Nifadkar et al., 2012). Strong career commitment is also an overlapping effect of positive psychological capital, and it positively influences hotel interns\u2019 attitude-behavior performance\nTABLE 9 | Moderating mediation effects of PC.\nHypothesis Coefficients LLCI ULCI t-Statistics H5: Occupational Stigma Perception \u00d7 Professional Commitment\u2192 Emotional Exhaustion 0.1070 0.0589 0.1551 4.3749*** H6: Emotional Exhaustion \u00d7 Professional Commitment\u2192 Retention Willingness 0.0872 0.0370 0.1374 3.4171*** ***Represents p < 0.001.\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 11 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 798526\nand reduces the negative emotion (Abbas et al., 2012). Luthans et al. (2007) also agreed that there is a positive relationship between positive psychological capital and intention to stay and affective commitment. The effect of emotional depletion as a mediating variable on perceived career stigma and intention to stay, as confirmed by this study, confirmed the resource depletion caused by the job demands perspective, the environmental factors and management style that trigger resource imbalance among interns, and the psychological stress of frontline interns caused by job insecurity and bullying by customers that disrupt individual resource balance. This highlights the significant role of emotional depletion in perceived occupational stigma and retention willingness (Cuyper et al., 2012). This study responds to Ramaci et al.\u2019s (2021) related research on the impact of occupational stigma on organizational cognitive variables and outcomes, highlighting that occupational stigma moderates the relationship between job demands and outcomes, highlighting the importance of appropriate interventions in hotel interns, and highlighting that hotel interns are among those at high risk of being stigmatized, prompting existing research to focus on the impact of occupational stigma on frontline hotel interns\u2019 physical and mental health effects (Wagner et al., 2014), and the perceived risk of stigmatization among hotel interns as a non-habitual environment will be valued (Xiang et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2021a), and the value added and nurturing of individual resources and the importance of career commitment in this study echoes Falco et al. (2021) for the role of work resources in the relationship between perceived risk and emotional exhaustion, and since this model of association has been little studied in past research, this study considers resources and social learning pathways as a psychological adjustment tool for hotel interns to combat emotional exhaustion and willingness to stay in their jobs, broadening the context of Di Fabio (2017) research on organizational behavioral stress in human resource management for individuals. This study expands on existing research on illness stigma by exploring the associative value of behavioral and psychological\nresearch on non-medical staff to explore the emotional and behavioral responses of hotel interns (Barattucci et al., 2020; Pagliaro et al., 2021)."

The theoretical integration model explains the process of resource self-allocation and transformation of hotel interns and highlights the mechanism of contextual interaction of social learning implied behind the highly regulative role of professional commitment. To explore boundary-action mechanism conditions, this study used career commitment as a variable in the moderating mechanism of action. Previous studies explored career commitment as an outcome variable of organizational socialization, while this study explored the association between perceived career stigma and emotional exhaustion, as well as emotional exhaustion and retention intention, by using professional commitment as a resource trait. The dynamic processes of resource flow, input, output, and transformation in professional commitment were explored, and the influence of professional commitment as a resource allocation process and value-added spiral effect in hotel interns\u2019 occupational stigma perception and retention willingness was explained from a dynamic perspective. Professional commitment was a variable linking resource conservation theory and social learning theory provided a framework for exploring the existing segmentation of hotel interns\u2019 positive organizational behavior. In terms of exploring the antecedent influences of occupational stigma, this study confirmed the significant effects of public stereotypes of occupational competence and occupational information on occupational stigma in hotels through contextual experiments. Previous studies explored the differential distribution patterns of occupational stigma by examining dirty jobs in hotels, confirming the significant effects of public stereotypes of occupational competence and occupational information on occupational stigma through contextual experiments and manipulated positive and negative information environments to confirm public stereotypes\u2019 influence on hotel practitioners\u2019 perceived occupational stigma. Moreover, it reflected the boundaries of hotel occupational stigma perceptions and the perceptual processes and effects of hotel practitioners behind the boundaries through the different public observation perspectives (Dick, 2005). This study constructs an antecedent model of information-stereotypeperception in a stigmatization context, which provides a causal mechanism basis for the subsequent cognitive behaviors of hotel interns\u2019 acceptance of and reactions to resources after encountering a stigmatizing experience and opening the black box of hotel interns\u2019 stigmatization perception self-mechanism.\nPractical Implications The practical significance of this study is to provide a relevant decision basis for improving human capital effectiveness, human organization optimization, and structural framework stability in the hotel industry in the post-COVID-19 period. In terms of human capital effectiveness, when the hotel industry is experiencing a public health crisis, the emotional and psychological behaviors of hotel employes need attention, especially since the interaction between customers and hotel employes is more sensitive and vulnerable to a public health crisis, and the more sudden bullying hotel employes are subjected to it, hotels need to offer multiple case-led career awareness workshops to achieve stress management for employes, especially\nfor hotels implementing management trainee programs, they need to reduce the loss of human capital effectiveness and enhance the risk prevention and effectiveness of human capital transformation through various forms of workshops at the early stage of interns\u2019 induction and socialization. Regarding human organization optimization, interns are the reserve strength and useful supplement of the hotel workforce. Internship resources guarantee hotel manpower cost optimization and new strength. Therefore, the hotel needs to customize the individual development plan for interns through the design of job-level optimization and professional career planning paths, so that interns can feel the importance of the hotel\u2019s individual career development and promote interns to establish good interpersonal relationships and be in a positive organizational culture, so that hotel interns can develop a sense of professional identity, belonging, and commitment, and then enhance their sense of self-efficacy and belonging. In terms of the human resource structural framework stability, COVID-19 underscores the fact owing to a large number of departures and rotations, hotel interns are an important organizational factor for the human resource structural framework stability. This requires hotels to pay attention to risk warning, prevention, and timeliness of talent development programs, introduce positive reward mechanisms to accelerate the organizational socialization of interns, improve their career commitment, enhance the internship experience, and ultimately form a stable working environment. The hotel needs to focus on risk warning, prevention, and the timeliness of talent development programs. Also at the level of human organizational development, hotels should encourage their organizations to optimize the balance between hotel interns\u2019 work demands and resources (Falco et al., 2021) and considering that hotel interns need to invest additional psycho-physical energy for resource integration and social learning effectiveness, hotels should provide interns with more time and resources (e.g., equipment, adequate social space) to realize self-worth and strengthen selfefficacy (Falco et al., 2021), achieving a good balance between hotel interns\u2019 work demands and work resources, and prevent the influence and spread of negative psychological and behavioral aspects of individuals."

            "text": "With the foundation of resource conservation theory and social learning theory, although this study further expands the depth of research on resources in organizational behavior and micropsychological behavior in terms of theoretical integration, the discussion on the contextual interaction mechanism of social learning theory is insufficient, and future studies can be realized through in-depth interviews and focus group interviews with hotel interns to explore the diversified influencing factors and paths of hotel retention intentions. Second, another limitation is that the research data on occupational stigma perceptions were collected and conducted through a one-time cross-sectional data through a contextual experiment, which has certain bias interference, and the fact that most of the participants in the experiment are hotel residents also affects the results of data analysis. Third, the convenience sampling used in this study is susceptible to high levels of sampling error from selection\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 13 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 798526\nbias and influences beyond the control of the researcher, and reliability can be questioned, making the sampling method a major limitation of this study as well. Future studies can adopt diverse research methods to improve the data quality, and improve the study\u2019s rigor by manipulating more variables and experimental environments. Future research can focus on the combined effect of resource interaction and social learning under the professional commitment traits of hotel interns and can further theorize and analyze the specific mechanisms of resource allocation and flow at the micro-level through a deeper psychological understanding of hotel interns."
