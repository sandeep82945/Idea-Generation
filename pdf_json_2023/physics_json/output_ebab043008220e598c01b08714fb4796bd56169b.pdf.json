    "abstractText": "Recently, certain challenges have persisted in PH sensor applications, especially when employing hafnium oxide (HfO2) thin films as sensing layers, where issues related to sensitivity, hysteresis, and long-term stability hamper performance. Microwave annealing (MWA) technology, as a promising solution for addressing these challenges, has gained significant attraction due to its unique advantages. In this article, the effects of microwave annealing (MWA) treatment on the sensing behaviors of Extended-Gate Field-Effect Transistors (EGFETs) utilizing HfO2 as a sensing film have been investigated for the first time. Various power levels of MWA treatment (1750 W/2100 W/2450 W) were selected to explore the optimal processing conditions. A thorough physical analysis was conducted to characterize the surface of the MWA-treated HfO2 sensing thin film using techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Our findings reveal that MWA treatment effectively increased the surface sites (Ns) in the HfO2 sensing thin film, consequently leading to an increase in the pH sensitivity of EGFETs to 59.6 mV/pH, as well as a reduction in hysteresis and an enhancement in long-term stability. These results suggest that MWA offers a straightforward, energy-efficient method to enhance overall HfO2 sensing film performance in EGFETs, offering insights for HfO2 applications and broader microelectronics challenges.",

            "text": "In 1970, the pioneering work of Bergveld led to the development of the ion-sensitive field-effect transistor (ISFET), marking a substantial milestone in the field of pH sensing and the measurement of ion concentrations [1,2]. Since then, numerous studies have been devoted to improving the sensing capabilities of the ISFET due to its inherent issues of low sensitivity and instability [3,4]. Given that ISFETs are directly integrated onto the FET electrode, they come with several disadvantages such as device instability, low current sensitivity, susceptibility to light interference, etc. [5]. Optical effects, hysteresis, and drift are the three non-ideal characteristics observed in ISFET-based pH sensors. To overcome these drawbacks, researchers introduced the Extended-Gate Field-Effect Transistor (EGFET), which has gained widespread popularity in biosensor applications [6\u201310]. EGFETs are favored for their long-term stability, insensitivity to light and temperature drift, and disposability. Functioning on the same working principles as ISFETs, EGFETs comprise a sensing structure and an independent MOSFET [6,11]. The sensing structure includes a sensing thin film in direct contact with the electrolyte, which is directly connected to the FET via a metal line. The sensing film, when exposed to an electrolyte solution, changes in response to variations in the H+ concentration of the tasted solution [11\u201315]. As a result, selecting an appropriate sensing film compatible with CMOS technology becomes crucial for achieving both the sensitivity and long-term stability of the sensor.\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 1854. https://doi.org/10.3390/mi14101854 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/micromachines\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 1854 2 of 12\nSensitive materials have become the focal point of recent advancements in pH sensing technology, emphasizing miniaturization, affordability, convenience, and real-time sensing. In addition, the sensitivity [16] and corrosiveness [17] to alkali metal ions restrain the application of pH measurements in strongly acidic and alkaline solutions. In order to be compatible with advanced complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology, thin high-k dielectric films are promising candidates for the manufacturing of pH sensors. In Table 1, several high-k dielectric materials, such as SiO2, Si3N4, Al2O3, IGZO, and Ta2O5, are presented with relatively high sensitivity. However, these materials come with their own set of challenges. For example, SiO2 and Si3N4-gated ISFETs [18,19] exhibit non-uniform sensitivity responses to variations in pH levels. The Al2O3 layer [20\u201322] tends to detach after prolonged contact with the test liquid, while the IGZO layer [23,24] demonstrates pronounced susceptibility to corrosion in alkaline environments. Additionally, Ta2O5 [18,25] displays considerable sensitivity to light. These disadvantages impose limitations on their application in pH detection. On the other hand, ultra-thin hafnium oxide (HfO2) has attracted much attention due to its exceptional sensitivity and stability [26\u201328].\nHowever, several instability phenomena arising from defects in the sensing film, such as charge traps, buried points, and slow reactions, hinder the application of EGFETs. Therefore, it is necessary to fabricate high-quality films with minimal defects to serve as sensing thin films. The commonly accepted sensing mechanism of a pH sensor could be explained with the site dissociation model, referring to the chemical reaction between free hydrogen ions in the electrolyte and amphoteric groups on the surface of the sensing thin film. Among these surface treatment methods, microwave annealing (MWA) treatment holds unique advantages, including reduced heat impact, as well as instantaneous and uniform heating. The ability of MWA to provide rapid and even heating holds significant promise, especially in the context of treating PH-sensitive films, offering a more controlled and precise treatment process. In this article, the pH sensing characteristics of HfO2 sensing layers were investigated, where their response was examined through a series of experiments with various MWA treatment powers. These evaluations were carried out using an EGFET structure, with the HfO2 sensing layers being fabricated using atomic layer deposition (ALD). Notably, MWA treatment yielded significant improvements in sensing performance, particularly in enhancing the pH sensitivity to 59.6 mV/pH, close to the Nernst limit. The linearity of sensitivity exceeds 99.9%. MWA also improved long-term stability, with sensitivity only dropping to 5% during tests up to 20 days. Furthermore, a monotonical relationship between increased sensitivity and MWA treatment power was established. The annealing power of 2450 W was identified as optimal, delivering markedly improved pH sensitivity and long-term stability. The above results indicate that microwave annealing is an effective method to improve the sensing ability of HfO2-EGFET pH sensors. The researchers used X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to analyze the surface composition and morphology of HfO2 to explain the mechanism of MWA treatment. Our findings indicate that the increase in surface roughness following annealing may be the underlying reason for the enhanced pH response.\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 1854 3 of 12"

For comparison, Figure 3a\u2013d show the morphologies of the HfO2 films with the 0 W, 1750 W, 2100 W, and 2450 W conditions, respectively. The HfO2 films exhibited a columnar microstructure. Notably, under the 2450 W condition, the columnar grain size was found to be larger compared to the conditions at 0 W, 1750 W, and 2100 W. Additionally, the root mean square (Rq) roughness values for the films, corresponding to microwave-assisted (MWA) powers of 0 W, 1750 W, 2100 W, and 2450 W, were measured at 0.674 nm, 0.865 nm, 1.10 nm, and 1.18 nm, respectively. As the MWA power increased, the surface roughness of the HfO2 film gradually increased. The 2450 W condition showed the roughest surface. From the above-mentioned results, we assumed that the improvement in roughness of the film occurred as the MWA power increased. Actually, the surface morphologies are relevant to the increase in Ns. The observed transition of the film microstructures from a homogeneous surface to a rough surface may be ascribed to the greater quantity of -OH groups in the HfO2 film to transform its structure, as shown in Figure 3e.\n(a) (b)\nAs fabricated\n1750 W\nRq=0.865nm\n2100 W 2450 W\nFigure 2.

The observed transition of the film microstructures from a homogeneous surface to a rough surface may be ascribed to the greater quantity of -OH groups in the HfO2 film to transform its structure, as shown in Figure 3e. Apart from the film morphology and structure, the chemical compositions of the HfO2 films after MWA at three different powers were examined using XPS. Figure 4a\u2013d present the O 1s XPS spectra of the HfO2 films performed at the three MWA powers, respectively. The O 1s peak is de-convoluted into two components: one at 529.8 eV, corresponding to the Hf-OH bonds, and the other at 532.1 eV, corresponding to the Hf-O-Hf bonds. Table 2 provides detailed composition information for the HfO2 films. It can be seen that the area of the Hf-OH shows a growing trend with the increase in MWA power. The \u2013OH groups near the surface acted as buried sites resulting in hysteresis, so hysteresis increased with the increase in the \u2013OH groups after the MWA treatment [21]. The red line and black line were expressed as the fitted data and experimental data, respectively. The O 1s core-level spectra of the HfO2 films with multiplet splitting are shown in Figure 4. We define the peak at 529.8 eV as the peak of Hf-O, with the peak variation attributed to the partial Si-O production; 532.1 eV is the peak of Hf-O-Si, which decreases in area as the annealing power increases, and therefore the silicate content decreases. Finally, the area of the 529.2 eV Hf-O peak varies as a function of annealing temperature and is maximal at 2100 W, which means that the oxygen containing groups have the highest content at this time.\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 1854 6 of 12\nMicromachines 2023, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 12\n(a) (b)\n(c) (d)\n(e)\nFigure 3.

When the surface amphiphilic group reacts with H+, the surface sites exist in the form of Hf-O, Hf-OH2+, and Hf-OH, and the number of surface sites Ns is the sum of these three sites. Based on Figure 5, Ns as well as the sensitivity showed a significant increase with the increasing power of the MWA treatment, showing a monotonic increasing trend [20]. In addition, with the increase in the MWA power, the particles inside the film get more energy and a stronger lateral movement ability, and the refinement of the spikes on the surface of the film is more obvious, which leads to the increase in roughness, which could increase sensitivity [29]. To acquire further understanding of the HfO2-EGFET pH sensor\u2019s sensing behaviours, it was tested in real-time in this experiment by cycling the buffer solution from pH 10 to pH 4, and back. During this process, we maintained a constant gate bias voltage (VM) of MOSFET at 3.8 V to ensure the device works in the linear region. The shift of the threshold voltage (VM \u2212 Vt) was calculated using the formula VM \u2212 Vt = Ids/gm, where gm represents the transconductance. The phenomenon of hysteresis is that VM \u2212 Vt is not consistent for the same pH during multiple cycles of the test. Here, the hysteresis width (4Vt) is defined as the difference in VM \u2212 Vt between the pH 7 of the neighboring loops (as shown in Figure 6a\u2013d). The hysteresis of the devices without microwave annealing treatment was about 3 mV at a minimum, while the hysteresis showed a noticeable increase with the increase in the MWA power. In this case, the average hysteresis value of multiple devices after microwave annealing treatment at 2450 W for 600 s was 44 mV. Such hysteresis was attributed to defects in the sensing membrane. Typically, the device\u2019s response is primarily attributed to the interfacial reaction occurring between the solution and the sensitive membrane. This interaction encompasses both rapid and gradual response processes. The fast response is mainly caused by the reaction between the surface amphiphilic groups and the hydrogen ions in the electrolyte; the slow response mainly has an overall response between the hydrated ions in the buried sites below the sensing membrane. After MWA, the oxygen-containing group Hf-OH on the surface of the sensitive membrane increases and the surface defects become larger, resulting in an observable increase in immediate hysteresis. To investigate the long-term stability of MWA-treated devices, sensing behaviours of multiple sets of devices were continuously evaluated over a 20-day duration. The comparisons of sensitivity and hysteresis characteristics over the 20-day period are shown in Figure 7. It was found that the sensitivity and hysteresis of the devices decreased with increasing time, and basically reached stability after about 6 days. The sensitivity of the unannealed device decreases from the initial 51.43 mV/pH to 48.45 mV/pH after 20 days, while the hysteresis basically maintains a fluctuation range of 3 mV, ranging from 7 mV to 5.7 mV. In contrast, the device annealed at 2450 W exhibited a decrease from the initial 59.60 mV/pH to 54.57 mV/pH after 20 days, which is greater than the 20-day sensitivity of the other three groups of devices, and also greater than the unannealed device, with only a 6.25% reduction. The hysteresis, on the other hand, decreases from an initial 44.2 mV on day 1, which decreases to 16.2 mV after day 5, and subsequently fluctuates around 10 mV, ultimately decreasing to 6.3 mV after 20 days.\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 1854 10 of 12\nMicromachines 2023, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 12 which depends entirely on the intrinsic properties of the sensing material such as the surface site number Ns and the equilibrium constants of Ka and Kb. \u03b2int can be expresses as: \ud835\udefd = 2\ud835\udc5e \ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc3e /\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc36 (2) where, when the material is identified as HfO2, the reaction constant and the dissociation constant associated with the acid\u2013base equilibrium are definite values that can be set to a constant value = 16 \u00b5F/cm2, in order for the sensitivity of the ISFET device to increase with the increase in the surface site density Ns.

In addition, with the increase in the MWA power, the particles inside the film get more energy and a stronger lateral movement ability, and the refinement of the spikes on the surface of the film is more obvious, which leads to the increase in roughness, which could increase sensitivity [29].\nTo acquire further understanding of the HfO2-EGFET pH sensor\u2019s sensing behaviours, it was tested in real-time in this experiment by cycling the buffer solution from pH 10 to pH 4, and back. During this process, we maintained a constant gate bias voltage (VM) of MOSFET at 3.8 V to ensure the device works in the linear region. The shift of the threshold voltage (VM \u2212 Vt) was calculated using the formula VM \u2212 Vt = Ids/gm, where gm represents the transconductance. The phenomenon of hysteresis is that VM \u2212 Vt is not consistent for the same pH during multiple cycles of the test. Here, the hysteresis width (\u25b3Vt) is defined as the difference in VM \u2212 Vt between the pH 7 of the neighboring loops (as shown in Figure 6a\u2013d). The hysteresis of the devices without microwave annealing treatment was about 3 mV at a minimum, while the hysteresis showed a noticeable increase with the increase in the MWA power. In this case, the average hysteresis value of multiple devices after microwave annealing treatment at 2450 W for 600 s was 44 mV. Such hysteresis was attributed to defects in the sensing membrane. Typically, the device\u2019s response is primarily attributed to the interfacial reaction occurring between the solution and the sensitive membrane. This interaction encompasses both rapid and gradual response processes. The fast response is mainly caused by the reaction between the surface amphiphilic groups and the hydrogen ions in the electrolyte; the slow response mainly has an overall response between the hydrated ions in the buried sites below the sensing membrane. After MWA, the oxygen-containing group Hf-OH on the surface of the sensitive membrane increases and the surface defects become larger, resulting in an observable increase in immediate hysteresis.\n(a) (b)\nMicromachines 2023, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 12\n(c) (d)\n(e)\nFigure 6.

The comparisons of sensitivity and hysteresis characteristics over the 20-day period are shown in Figure 7. It was found that the sensitivity and hysteresis of the devices decreased with increasing time, and basically reached stability after about 6 days. The sensitivity of the unannealed device decreases from the initial 51.43 mV/pH to 48.45 mV/pH after 20 days, while the hysteresis basically maintains a fluctuation range of 3 mV, ranging from 7 mV to 5.7 mV. In contrast, the device annealed at 2450 W exhibited a decrease from the initial 59.60 mV/pH to 54.57 mV/pH after 20 days, which is greater than the 20-day sensitivity of the other three groups of devices, and also greater than the unannealed device, with only a 6.25% reduction. The hysteresis, on the other hand, decreases from an initial 44.2 mV on day 1, which decreases to 16.2 mV after day 5, and subsequently fluctuates around 10 mV, ultimately decreasing to 6.3 mV after 20 days.\n4.

The investigation focused on how MWA treatment\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 1854 11 of 12\ninfluenced the sensing performance of HfO2 sensing film-based EGFETs. The AFM and XPS results reveal that the HfO2 sensing film exhibits increased surface roughness and a higher concentration of OH-related atomic groups on the surface. As a result, the EGFET demonstrates excellent sensing performance, including a notably high sensitivity up to 59.6 mV/pH and long-term stability with a fluctuation of less than 5% over a 20-day period.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, S.C. and H.Y.; methodology, S.C.; software, S.C.; validation, S.C., D.W. and H.Y.; formal analysis, H.Y.; investigation, S.C.; resources, D.W.; data curation, S.C., Y.Z.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, S.C.; writing\u2014review and editing, D.W.; H.Y., X.S.; visualization, H.Y.; supervision, D.W.; project administration, D.W.; funding acquisition, D.W.
