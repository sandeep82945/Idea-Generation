    "abstractText": "The coral-derived fungus Aspergillus austwickii SCSIO41227 from Beibu Gulf yielded four previously uncharacterized compounds, namely asperpentenones B\u2013E (1\u20134), along with twelve known compounds (5\u201316). Their structures were elucidated using HRESIMS and NMR (1H and 13C NMR, HSQC, HMBC), among which the stereo-structure of compounds 1\u20133 was determined by calculated ECD. Furthermore, compounds 1\u201316 were evaluated in terms of their enzyme (acetylcholinesterase (AChE), pancreatic lipase (PL), and neuraminidase (NA)) inhibitory activities. These bioassay results revealed that compounds 2 and 14 exerted noticeable NA inhibitory effects, with IC50 values of 31.28 and 73.64 \u03bcM, respectively. In addition, compound 3 exhibited a weak inhibitory effect against PL. Furthermore, these compounds showed the potential of inhibiting enzymes in silico docking analysis to demonstrate the interactions between compounds and proteins.",

            "text": "The coral-derived fungi, characterized by their easy cultivation and high productivity, have been demonstrated to be an essential source region for marine natural compounds [1]. Numerous novel secondary metabolites with remarkable bioactivities, including antitumor, antibacterial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and other biological activities, have been discovered in coral-associated fungi [2\u20134]. The fungal genus Aspergillus is a highly significant group of microorganisms derived from coral, encompassing more than 180 species capable of producing bioactive compounds such as terpenoids, polyketides, alkaloids, sterols, peptides, and others [5]. Furthermore, Aspergillus has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases affecting a wide range of organisms. An example is the occurrence of aspergillosis in sea fan corals which has resulted in mortality rates ranging from 20% to 90% in the Florida Keys [6]. Over thirty compounds have been documented from Aspergillus sydowii in the scientific literature, exhibiting diverse biological activities, such as phytocidal, antimicrobial, antiviral, and cytotoxic activity [7]. Their potential uses in medicine, agriculture, and other fields are vast and could lead to the development of new therapeutic agents, disinfectants, and pesticides. The pancreatic lipase enzyme plays a pivotal role in the metabolism of dietary fat and impedes its absorption through the small intestine, thereby exerting a direct impact on the underlying cause of obesity. The inhibition of PL directly influences the root cause of obesity [8]. Obesity, which has become an epidemic in many parts of the world, is a complex health issue that affects millions of people. Hence, the investigation of pancreatic\nMar. Drugs 2023, 21, 567. https://doi.org/10.3390/md21110567 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/marinedrugs\nMar.

However, it is important to note that the use of NA inhibitors for the treatment of pancreatic cancer is still in its early stages. NA inhibitors have been associated with the potential treatment of chemotherapy-resistant pancreatic cancer [9]. More research is needed to understand their full potential and the possible side effects they may cause. During our continued efforts to discover structurally novel and biologically active secondary metabolites from coral-derived fungi, we successfully isolated two unprecedented polyketides, namely asperpentenones B (1) and C (2), one new asperfuran named asperpentenone D (3), and a previously unreported kojic acid dipalmitate known as asperpentenone E (4) (Figure 1). In addition, twelve known compounds were also identified in the extract of Aspergillus austwickii SCSIO41227 obtained from the Beibu Gulf coral. The chemical diversity of these metabolites encompassed polyketides, alkaloids, and benzene derivatives. Notably, compound 1 displayed a rare cyclopentenone\u2013tetrahydrofuran moiety. Herein, we present the comprehensive isolation process, structural elucidation results, and bioassay screening outcomes of all the isolated compounds. Our findings contribute to the understanding of these compounds and pave the way for their further exploration and utilization in a wide range of industries.\nMar.

A comprehensive examination of its 1H NMR data (Figure S9) in DMSO-d6 revealed the presence of three methyls (\u03b4H 1.38 (d, J = 6.7 Hz, 7-CH3); 2.20 (s, 10-CH3); and 2.07 (s, 12-CH3)); one oxymethylene group (\u03b4H 4.35 (s, H-1)); and one alkene proton (\u03b4H 6.33 (s, H-3)). The diagnostic NMR data suggested the presence of six benzene carbons (\u03b4C 145.4, 103.6, 152.9, 108.1, 150.3, and 104.0) and a carbonyl group (\u03b4C 170.6). A comparison of its NMR spectroscopic data with compound 5 showed many similarities. The planar structure of 2 was deduced via 2D NMR spectra (Figures S11 and S12). In the HMBC spectrum (Figure 2), two tertiary methyl groups (\u03b4H 2.07, H-16, and 2.20, H-15, each 3H, s) correlating with C-13, C-12, and C-11 as well as C11, C-10, and C-9, respectively. The multiple HBMC correlations of H-14/C-7, C-8, C-6, H7/C-14, C-8, C-6, C-5, and C-13 indicated the position of C-7 and C-14 (Figure 2). The absolute configuration of compound 2 was further confirmed through ECD calculations (Figure 4). The compound was analyzed in two different configurations, as depicted in Figure 3. Comparing the calculated ECD with experimental ECD (Figure S14), it can be concluded that compound 2, possesses an absolute configuration of 7R. Consequently, the elucidated structure of compound 2 was unequivocally identified as asperpentenone C (2).\nFigure 4.

The multiple HBMC correlations of H-14/C-7, C-8, C-6, H-7/C-14, C-8, C-6, C-5, and C-13 indicated the position of C-7 and C-14 (Figure 2). The absolute configuration of compound 2 was further confirmed through ECD calculations (Figure 4). The compound was analyzed in two different configurations, as depicted in Figure 3. Comparing the calculated ECD with experimental ECD (Figure S14), it can be concluded that compound 2, possesses an absolute configuration of 7R.

The detailed analysis of the 1H NMR data (Figure S15) of 3 revealed the presence of one methyl (\u03b4H 1.75 (dd, J = 6.7, 1.6 Hz, H-15)); four alkene protons (\u03b4H 5.71 (m, H-11); 6.31 (dd, J = 15.2, 10.4 Hz, -12); 6.09 (ddd, J = 15.0, 10.3, 1.9 Hz, H-13); and 5.77 (m, H-14)); two methylene groups (\u03b4H 3.46\nMar.

The presence of fifteen carbon signals of 3, including a carbonyl group (\u03b4C 176.8) and six benzene carbons (\u03b4C 129.4, 110.8, 150.9, 104.0, 140.9, and 140.9), was deduced with the obtained NMR spectra (13C NMR and HSQC) (Figures S16 and S17). In comparison with the literature, its structure exhibited a close relationship with the known compound asperfuran [11], differing only in the presence of the ethylic acid at C-3, which aligned with the molecular formula. This assertion was further supported by the key HMBC correlations from H-2 to C-3, C-8 C-4, and C-1 (Figure 2 and Figure S18). The absolute configuration of 3 was additionally confirmed through ECD calculations (Figure 4). The ECD calculation of compound 3 was performed for two different conformations, and by comparing the experimental ECD curves (Figure S20), it was determined that the absolute configuration is 10S. Therefore, the depicted structure of 3 is firmly established. Compound 4, red oil, exhibited a molecular formula C8H10O4 as determined with the (+) HRESIMS ion at m/z 171.0654 [M + H]+ (Figure S25), indicating four degrees of unsaturation. A comprehensive analysis of 1H NMR data of 4 revealed the presence of one methyl group (\u03b4H 1.16, (t, J = 7.5 Hz, H-8)) and two methylene groups (\u03b4H 4.31, (s, H-1) and 2.14, (q, J = 7.5 Hz, H-7)). The 13C NMR data of 4 showed the presence of eight carbons, including a carbonyl group (\u03b4C 173.5) and one oxymethylene group (\u03b4C, 59.5). The diagnostic NMR data (Table 2, Figures S21\u2013S24) exhibited several similarities to compound 8 [12]. The only discernible difference was the identification of an ethyl group located at C-6, which was confirmed by the corresponding NMR signals (\u03b4H 2.14 and 1.16; \u03b4C 21.0 and 11.0), as well as key HMBC correlations from H-7 to C-6 and C-8 (Figure 2). Ultimately, the structure of 4 was further validated through single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, with a perspective ORTEP plot depicted in Figure 5. Thus, based on these findings, the structure of compound 4 was unequivocally determined as asperpentenone E.\nMar. Drugs 2023, 21, 567 6 of 12\nMar.

Initially, we carried out comprehensive screening for the enzyme inhibitory activities of AChE, PL, and NA at a concentration of 50 \u03bcg/mL. This initial screening was crucial as it helped us to identify the promising compounds for further research. The compounds chosen for IC50 value determination were those exhibiting an inhibition rate exceeding 50%. The outcomes of the bioassay results revealed the activity of compounds 1, 10, 13, and 14 against AChE, with inhibition rates ranging from 20% to 26% at a concentration of 50 \u03bcg/mL. This result suggested that these compounds could potentially slow down the breakdown of acetylcholine in the brain, which is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in memory and cognitive function. We identified three compounds with initial screening inhibition rates exceeding 50% and therefore determined the IC50 value for each of them. The standard curve of these compounds was established by measuring the inhibition rate of different concentrations, and the equation of the standard curve was derived. Subsequently, the concentration of the compound with an inhibition rate of 50%, known as the IC50 value, was determined. Ultimately, compound 3 demonstrated weak activity against PL, with an IC50 value of 127.11 \u03bcM, compared with the positive control, which was 0.078 \u03bc\u039c.
