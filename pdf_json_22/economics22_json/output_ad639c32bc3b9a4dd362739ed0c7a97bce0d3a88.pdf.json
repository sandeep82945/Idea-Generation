    "abstractText": "Overnight rates, such as the SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) in the US, are central to the current reform of interest rate benchmarks. A striking feature of overnight rates is the presence of jumps and spikes occurring at predetermined dates due to monetary policy interventions and liquidity constraints. This corresponds to stochastic discontinuities (i.e., discontinuities occurring at ex-ante known points in time) in their dynamics. In this work, we propose a term structure modelling framework based on overnight rates and characterize absence of arbitrage in a generalised Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) setting. We extend the classical short-rate approach to accommodate stochastic discontinuities, developing a tractable setup driven by affine semimartingales. In this context, we show that simple specifications allow to capture stylized facts of the jump behavior of overnight rates. In a Gaussian setting, we provide explicit valuation formulas for bonds and caplets. Furthermore, we investigate hedging in the sense of local risk-minimization when the underlying term structures feature stochastic discontinuities.",

            "text": "The discontinuation of the publication of Libor rates for the majority of currencies and tenors on January 1, 2022, and the cessation of the US dollar Libor panel on June 30, 2023, mark a major transition for interest rate markets.1 In the reform of interest rate benchmarks, overnight rates play a central role, such as SOFR (secured overnight financing rate) in the US, SONIA (Sterling overnight index average) in the UK and \u20acSTR (Euro short-term rate) in the Euro zone, sometimes generically referred to as risk-free rates (RFRs).\nA distinctive feature of overnight rates is the presence of stochastic discontinuities in their dynamics: jumps and spikes occurring at predetermined dates or at regular intervals, as a result of monetary policy interventions as well as regulatory and liquidity constraints. In particular, overnight rates tend to jump in correspondence with meetings of the monetary policy authority, and these meetings usually follow a set schedule. This is confirmed by the analysis in Backwell and Hayes (2022) documenting that most of the variation in the SONIA rate over the years 2016-2020 occurs in correspondence with the meeting dates of the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England. The recent analysis in Schlo\u0308gl et al. (2023) provides evidence of a similar phenomenon for SOFR, highlighting the importance of modelling scheduled jumps that coincide with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting dates.\nIn this work, the predetermined dates at which the overnight rate (and, potentially, forward rates) is expected to exhibit discontinuities will be called expected jump dates and denoted by S \u201c ts1, . . . , sMu. In the case of SOFR the presence of expected jump dates is well illustrated by Figure 1. As a particular example, consider the spike observed on September 17, 2019. According to Anbil et al. (2020), \u201cStrains in money markets in September seem to have originated from routine market events, including a corporate tax payment date and Treasury coupon settlement.

The analysis of Anbil et al. (2020) suggests that the date of this spike was known well in advance (a corporate tax payment date coinciding with a Treasury coupon settlement), while the magnitude of the jump was obviously not predictable.\nStarting from these observations, we develop a general framework for interest rate markets in the presence of overnight rates. A first key point is that the natural choice for the nume\u0301raire asset in this context corresponds to a rolled-over investment in the overnight rate, according to a schedule T \u201c tt1, t2, . . .u of roll-over dates. The nume\u0301raire can therefore exhibit jumps in correspondence with such roll-over dates, which represent an additional source of stochastic discontinuities, besides the expected jump dates mentioned above. Typically, the roll-over dates will be quite frequent, while expected jump dates will be less frequent, and it is not excluded that some expected jump dates coincide with roll-over dates. In this context, building on the results of Fontana et al. (2020), we extend the HJM approach by allowing for two different types of stochastic discontinuities. We characterize absence of arbitrage by means of generalized drift conditions, with specific no-arbitrage restrictions related to the stochastic discontinuities.\nAs a second main contribution, we develop a tractable class of models based on affine semimartingales, i.e. affine processes which allow for stochastic discontinuities (see Keller-Ressel et al. (2019)). We show that affine semimartingale models for an overnight rate provide a natural extension of classical affine short-rate models to the case of stochastic discontinuities. As illustrated by a simple example, this class of models allows reproducing several stylized features of overnight rates, in particular spikes and jumps at fixed times. Towards practical applications, we derive explicit pricing formulas for bonds and caplets in an extended Hull-White model with discontinuities.\nFinally, we study the hedging of derivatives related to risk-free rates (or, more generally, derivatives written on Libor fallbacks determined by RFRs). The presence of stochastic discontinuities induces market incompleteness and, therefore, we resort to local risk-minimization. We show that the locally risk-minimizing strategy admits a decomposition into two components: a dynamic continuous-time strategy representing the delta-hedging strategy, and an additional component that optimally rebalances the portfolio in correspondence to the expected jump dates. We exemplify this result by considering the problem of hedging a SOFR-caplet by trading in a SOFR futures contract, the most liquidly traded contract written on SOFR at the time of writing.\nRelated literature. The reform of interest rate benchmarks is receiving considerable attention and, therefore, we limit our review of the literature to some contributions that are specifically related to our work, referring to Henrard (2019), Piterbarg (2020), Klingler and Syrstad (2021) and Huggins and Scha\u0308ller (2022) for a general analysis of the challenges of the Libor reform. One of the earliest and most influential contributions is Lyashenko and Mercurio (2019), based on an extension of the Libor market model. Classical short-rate models have been revisited in the post-Libor universe by several authors, starting from Mercurio (2018). Several recent works employ the classical HullWhite model (see, e.g., Hofman (2020), Turfus (2020), Hasegawa (2021)). Always in a short-rate setup, Skov and Skovmand (2021) propose a multi-factor Gaussian model in order to analyze SOFR futures, while Fontana (2023) develops a model driven by general affine processes in view of pricing applications. Rutkowski and Bickersteth (2021) adopt a Vasic\u030cek model for SOFR and other reference rates and study the hedging of SOFR-based derivatives, also in the presence of funding costs and collateralization. A different approach is taken by Macrina and Skovmand (2020), who adopt a linear rational model for the savings account and derive several pricing formulas. We also mention Willems (2020), where an extended SABR model is applied to the pricing of caplets in the post-Libor setup.\nThe papers mentioned in the previous paragraph do not take into account stochastic discontinuities in the dynamics of overnight rates. To the best of our knowledge, the earliest works acknowledging this fact are Piazzesi (2001, 2005). In Kim and Wright (2014), a term structure model with jumps occurring in correspondence of macroeconomic announcements dates is presented. In recent works, stochastic discontinuities are playing an increasingly important role. In particular, Andersen and Bang (2020) develop a model that can generate spikes in the SOFR dynamics, both at totally inaccessible times and at anticipated times. Gellert and Schlo\u0308gl (2021) and Brace et al. (2022) show that a diffusive HJM model for instantaneous forward rates is compatible with the presence of jumps/spikes at fixed times in the short rate, consistently with the empirical evidence on SOFR. In Backwell and Hayes (2022), the SONIA rate is modelled via a short-rate approach by relying on a pure jump process with both unexpected and predetermined jump dates. Schlo\u0308gl et al. (2023) make use of a short-rate affine jump-diffusion framework to provide a model which is able to jointly fit the overnight US policy rate, SOFR and SOFR futures rates. Harju (2023) models US overnight rates, such as the effective Fed funds rate and the USD overnight Libor, in the setup of short rate models, also including jumps at fixed times. Finally, we mention that stochastic discontinuities also play an important role in credit markets (see Gehmlich and Schmidt (2018) and Fontana and Schmidt (2018)), while a general framework for multi-curve markets with stochastic discontinuities is developed in Fontana et al. (2020).\nStructure of the paper. In Section 2, we present a general view on post-Libor interest rate markets based on overnight rates. In Section 3, we develop a modelling framework based on the HJM approach extended to the case of stochastic discontinuities. In Section 4, we introduce a model based on affine semimartingales for overnight rates and provide explicit valuation formulas in an extended Hull-White model. Finally, in Section 5 we study locally risk-minimizing hedging strategies in the presence of stochastic discontinuities. Some of the more technical proofs are postponed to the Appendix."

            "text": "In this section, we give a fundamental description of an interest rate market in the presence of overnight rates. We replace the classical assumption of the existence of a savings account generated by an instantaneous short rate by a more general structure, which in particular allows for stochastic discontinuities. The first key point of our analysis is therefore a systematic study of the implications of a nume\u0301raire with stochastic discontinuities generated by overnight investment.\n2.1. The nume\u0301raire. The nume\u0301raire asset obtained by investing according to an overnight rate is generated by a roll-over strategy and as such is piecewise constant, being updated at every roll-over date. Those dates are predetermined (hence, deterministic) and we denote them by t1 \u0103 t2 \u0103 \u00a8 \u00a8 \u00a8 , usually corresponding to business days. We call those dates roll-over dates, as mentioned in the introduction, and collect them in the set T :\u201c ttn : n P Nu. Moreover, we set t0 :\u201c 0.\nIn this situation, the value at time t \u011b 0 of the overnight nume\u0301raire takes the following form: \u017a\ntn`1\u010ft\n` 1 ` rtn ptn`1 \u00b4 tnq \u02d8 , (2.1)\nwith rtn representing the overnight rate applicable to the time period rtn, tn`1s. To allow for greater generality, and in particular to include the classical framework into our setting (see Remark 2.1 below), we assume that the nume\u0301raire process S0 is given by\nS0t :\u201c exp \u02c6 \u017c t\n0 \u03c1u \u03b7pduq\n\u02d9\n, for all t \u011b 0, (2.2)\nwhere \u03b7 is a Borel measure on R` with the following structure:\n\u03b7pduq \u201c du` \u00ff\nnPN \u03b4tn pduq. (2.3)\nHere \u03b4tn denotes the Dirac measure in ttnu and \u03c1 is an adapted process satisfying \u015fT 0 |\u03c1t|\u03b7pdtq \u0103 8 a.s., for all T \u0105 0. We will refer to \u03c1 as the risk-free rate (RFR) process.\nRemark 2.1. (i) A discretely updated nume\u0301raire of the form (2.1) can be easily recovered from (2.2) by taking \u03c1tn \u201c logp1 ` rtn\u00b41 ptn \u00b4 tn\u00b41qq, for all n P N, and setting \u03c1 \u201d 0 outside of the set T .\n(ii) Classical interest rate models without stochastic discontinuities are based on the assumption of an absolutely continuous nume\u0301raire S0. This case can be recovered by simply setting T \u201c H, thus yielding S0t \u201c expp \u015ft 0 \u03c1u duq in (2.2), with \u03c1 representing the risk-free short rate.\n2.2. Notions of interest rates. The second key point in our analysis are the new features of postLibor markets. We therefore introduce several notions of interest rates which are important in such markets, relying mostly on Lyashenko and Mercurio (2019).\nWe denote by P pt, T q the price at date t of a zero-coupon bond with unit payoff at maturity T \u011b t. In the following, we will refer to zero-coupon bonds simply as bonds.\n2.2.1. The backward-looking rate. For each 0 \u010f S \u0103 T , the setting-in-arrears rate RpS, T q is the rate that is achieved over the period rS, T s by a rolled-over investment according to the roll-over dates T . This yields the rate\nRpS, T q :\u201c 1 T \u00b4 S\n\u02c6\n\u017a\nnPNpS,T q\n1 P ptn, tn`1q \u00b4 1 \u02d9 , (2.4)\nwhere NpS, T q :\u201c tn P N Y t0u : S \u010f tn and tn`1 \u010f T u denotes the set of indices of the roll-over dates tn for which the interval rtn, tn`1s is completely contained in rS, T s.\nThe setting-in-arrears rate RpS, T q is said to be backward-looking, since its value can be determined only at the end of the accrual period rS, T s and not at its beginning (as it would be the case for a forward rate). Backward-looking rates play a central role in post-Libor markets, having been adopted as the reference fallback rates for most Libor-based contracts and transactions.\nThe generality of our setup enables us to work with the exact definition (2.4) of the setting-inarrears rate regardless of the structure of S0 (in particular, also when S0 is absolutely continuous).\nRemark 2.2 (Relation to the nume\u0301raire). The overnight rate rtn mentioned in (2.1) can be obtained from bond prices via 1`rtn ptn`1 \u00b4 tnq \u201c 1{P ptn, tn`1q. Hence, if S0 is the overnight nume\u0301raire given in equation (2.1), then the setting-in-arrears rate RpS, T q can be directly written in terms of S0 as\nRpS, T q \u201c 1 T \u00b4 S\n\u02c6 S0T S0S \u00b4 1 \u02d9 . (2.5)\nIn the literature (see, e.g., Lyashenko and Mercurio (2019) and Skov and Skovmand (2021)), the nume\u0301raire S0 is usually assumed to be absolutely continuous (see part (ii) of Remark 2.1) and equation (2.5) is adopted as an approximation of the setting-in-arrears rate RpS, T q. As mentioned above, this approximation is not necessary in our setting with stochastic discontinuities.\n2.2.2. The forward-looking rate. The forward-looking rate F pS, T q is defined as the rate K that makes equal to zero the market value at time S of the payoff pT \u00b4SqpRpS, T q \u00b4Kq delivered at maturity T , for 0 \u010f S \u0103 T . Such an agreement is called a single-period swap. In contrast to the backward-looking rate, the forward-looking rate F pS, T q is determined at the beginning of the accrual period.\nRemark 2.3 (On the notion of forward-looking rate). The most widely adopted forward-looking rate is the CME term SOFR rate, which has been approved by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) in 2021 for use in cash products and, with some restrictions, derivatives. Moreover, since June 30, 2023, the CME term SOFR rates (plus the respective ISDA fixed spread adjustment) are\nused for calculation of the temporary synthetic 1-, 3- and 6-month USD-indexed Libor rates meant to facilitate the transition of the contracts that reference USD-indexed Libor (see the footnote on page 1). In theory, forward-looking rates should be determined as discussed above from market quotes of overnight index swaps (OIS), of which single-period swaps are the basic building blocks. However, the CME term SOFR rate is currently determined with a specific methodology, based on the work of Heitfield and Park (2019), that relies on market quotes of SOFR futures. This is due to the fact that liquidity in SOFR OIS is not deemed sufficient, while SOFR futures are traded in much larger volumes.2 Using futures prices to compute forward rates is a model-dependent procedure and also incurs into the issue of convexity adjustments. Therefore, in the current market environment of imperfect liquidity, it may happen that the CME term SOFR rate is not perfectly aligned with the forward-looking rate derived from SOFR swap quotes. In this paper, we shall not consider this issue, which will be addressed in a separate work.\n2.2.3. The forward term rate. Single-period swaps can be considered the basic contracts written on backward-looking and forward-looking rates in post-Libor markets, analogously to forward rate agreements in classical interest rate markets. For 0 \u010f S \u0103 T and t P r0, T s, the backward-looking forward rate Rpt, S, T q is defined as the rate K that makes equal to zero the value at time t of a single-period swap delivering the payoff pT \u00b4 SqpRpS, T q \u00b4 Kq at maturity T . Note that, differently from the classical concept of a forward rate, the backward-looking forward rate Rpt, S, T q is also defined inside the accrual period (i.e., for t P rS, T s), due to the backward-looking nature of RpS, T q.\nIn an analogous way, we define the forward-looking forward rate F pt, S, T q for any t P r0, Ss as the rate K that makes equal to zero the value at time t of a single-period swap delivering the payoff pT \u00b4 SqpF pS, T q \u00b4 Kq at maturity T . Clearly, the forward-looking forward rate satisfies F pS, S, T q \u201c F pS, T q, where F pS, T q is the forward-looking rate introduced above.\nComparing the notions of backward-looking and forward-looking forward rate, we notice that\nRpt, S, T q \u201c F pt, S, T q, for all t P r0, Ss. (2.6)\nHowever, while the forward-looking forward rate F p\u00a8, S, T q stops evolving at time S, the backwardlooking forward rate Rp\u00a8, S, T q continues to evolve until time T , when it reaches the terminal condition RpT, S, T q \u201c RpS, T q. Identity (2.6), which has been first pointed out in Lyashenko and Mercurio (2019), therefore implies that backward-looking forward rates and forward-looking forward rates can be consolidated into a single process Rp\u00a8, S, T q. In this work, we adopt this viewpoint and generically call the process Rp\u00a8, S, T q, considered in the whole time interval r0, T s, the forward term rate.\nRemark 2.4 (On the validity of (2.6)). The discussion in Remark 2.3 implies that, if F pS, T q is assumed to coincide with the CME term SOFR rate, then the identity F pS, T q \u201c RpS, S, T q may fail to hold in the current market environment, due to the CME term SOFR rate calculation methodology. In turn, this implies that violations to (2.6) cannot be excluded a priori. Allowing for violations to (2.6) would require to model F p\u00a8, S, T q separately from Rp\u00a8, S, T q, with the introduction of an intrinsic multi-curve dimension in the model. We will develop this aspect in a forthcoming work, where we will also provide a mathematical description of violations to (2.6) in terms of the strict local martingale property of solutions to a suitable BSDE. Here, howeover, we do not account for possible violations to (2.6), assuming implicitly that liquidity in SOFR swaps is sufficient for a robust determination of forward term rates, coherently with the viewpoint of Lyashenko and Mercurio (2019).\nIt is important to note that forward term rates can be expressed in terms of bond prices. Indeed, in view of formula (2.4), the backward-looking rate RpS, T q can be replicated by holding a static position in a bond with maturity S and investing the payoff P pS, Sq \u201c 1 received at time S into the overnight nume\u0301raire until time T . Since RpS, T q represents the floating leg of a single-period swap referencing the backward-looking rate, this implies that the forward term rate can be written as\nRpt, S, T q \u201c 1 T \u00b4 S\n\u02c6\nP pt, Sq P pt, T q \u00b4 1\n\u02d9\n, for all 0 \u010f t \u010f T,\n2CME has however announced that SOFR OIS will be used in the calculation of term SOFR rates once their volume will exceed 25% of the volume of SOFR futures (see https://www.cmegroup.com/market-data/files/ cme-term-sofr-reference-rates-benchmark-methodology.pdf).\nwhere we extend the definition of bond prices beyond maturity S by setting\nP pt, Sq :\u201c P pt, tnptqq\nP ptnptq\u00b41, tnptqq \u017a\nnPNpS,tq\n1 P ptn, tn`1q\nfor t \u0105 S,\nwith NpS, tq :\u201c tn P N Y t0u : S \u010f tn and tn`1 \u010f tu and nptq :\u201c inftn P N0 : tn \u0105 tu, for all t \u011b 0. The analysis developed in this section shows that, together with the nume\u0301raire S0, the family of bond prices tP p\u00a8, T q; T \u0105 0u constitutes the fundamental basis of a term structure model for a post-Libor market as considered here. This is the approach that we are going to adopt and develop in the next section, highlighting the role of stochastic discontinuities."

            "text": "In this section, we develop a general term structure model based on overnight rates in the presence of stochastic discontinuities. The main result of this section is Theorem 3.5, which provides a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for the risk-neutral property of a given probability measure.\nWe recall that, as mentioned in the introduction, in the considered interest rate market two different types of stochastic discontinuities arise naturally:\n(i) roll-over dates T \u201c tt1, t2, . . . u, corresponding to the discontinuities in the nume\u0301raire process S0, encoded in the atoms of the measure \u03b7 introduced in (2.3);\n(ii) expected jump dates S \u201c ts1, . . . , sMu, representing a set of deterministic times at which the RFR process \u03c1 and forward rates are expected to exhibit jumps.\nWe do allow for an overlap of these sets (i.e., T X S \u2030 H), meaning that stochastic discontinuities in the dynamics of the term structure of RFRs can occur simultaneously to some of the roll-over dates. In comparison to the roll-over dates in T , the expected jump dates in S are much less frequent, so that we consider only a finite number of them.\nRemark 3.1 (Extension to predictable times). The results of this section are also valid in the more general setting where S is a countable family of predictable times, see Fontana and Schmidt (2018). For simplicity of presentation and in order to treat S with the same techniques used for T , we suppose that S is a finite family of fixed dates.\nLet p\u2126,F ,F, Qq be a given stochastic basis, endowed with a filtration F \u201c pFtqt\u011b0 satisfying the usual conditions and supporting a d-dimensional Brownian motion W \u201c pWtqt\u011b0 and an integervalued random measure \u00b5pdt, dxq on R` \u02c6E, with compensator \u03bdpdt, dxq \u201c \u03bbtpdxqdt, where \u03bbtpdxq is a kernel from p\u2126\u02c6R`,Pq into pE,BpEqq, with P denoting the predictable sigma-field on \u2126\u02c6R` and pE,BpEqq a Polish space with its Borel sigma-field. The compensated random measure is denoted by \u00b5\u0303pdt, dxq :\u201c \u00b5pdt, dxq \u00b4 \u03bdpdt, dxq. We refer to Jacod and Shiryaev (2003) for all unexplained notions of stochastic calculus.\nThe analysis of Section 2.2 shows that the key ingredient of a term structure model in the postLibor framework as considered here is the family of bond prices tP p\u00a8, T q;T \u0105 0u together with the nume\u0301raire S0 defined in (2.2). To introduce a general modelling framework we consider an extension of the HJM approach allowing for discontinuous term structures.

Integration with respect to the measure \u03b7 in (3.1) is justified by the fact that, since the nume\u0301raire S0 jumps in correspondence of the atoms of \u03b7, bond prices are expected to be discontinuous (in maturity) at those points. More precisely, absence of arbitrage implies that bond prices have necessarily to be of the form (3.1) with respect to the same measure \u03b7 appearing in (2.2). This fact has been first pointed out in Gehmlich and Schmidt (2018), albeit in the context of default modelling.\nTo proceed further, we introduce the following technical requirements on (3.2).\nAssumption 3.3. The following conditions hold:\n(i) the initial forward curve T \u00de\u00d1 fp0, T q is pF0 b BpR`qq-measurable, real-valued and satisfies \u015fT\n0 |fp0, uq|\u03b7pduq \u0103 8, for all T \u0105 0, (ii) the drift process \u03b1 : \u2126\u02c6R2` \u00d1 R is progressively measurable3, satisfies \u03b1pt, T q \u201c 0 for 0 \u010f T \u0103 t,\nand \u017c T\n0\n\u017c u\n0 |\u03b1ps, uq|ds \u03b7pduq \u0103 8, for all T \u0105 0,\n(iii) the diffusive volatility process \u03c6 : \u2126 \u02c6R2` \u00d1 Rd is progressively measurable, satisfies \u03c6pt, T q \u201c 0 for 0 \u010f T \u0103 t, and\nd \u00ff\ni\u201c1\n\u017c T\n0\n\u02c6 \u017c u\n0 |\u03c6ips, uq|2ds\n\u02d91{2 \u03b7pduq \u0103 8, for all T \u0105 0,\n(iv) the jump function \u03c8 : \u2126 \u02c6 R` \u02c6 E \u02c6 R` \u00d1 R is a pP b BpEq b BpR`qq-measurable function satisfying \u03c8pt, x, T q \u201c 0 for 0 \u010f T \u0103 t and x P E, and\n\u017c T\n0\n\u017c\nE\n\u017c T\n0 |\u03c8ps, x, uq|2\u03b7pduq\u03bbspdxqds \u0103 8,\n(v) the stochastic discontinuity process V p\u00a8, T q \u201c pV pt, T qqtPr0,T s satisfies \u015fT 0 |\u2206V ps, uq|\u03b7pduq \u0103 8 for all s P S and \u2206V pt, T q \u201c 0 for all 0 \u010f T \u0103 t.\nAs a consequence of Assumption 3.3, all integrals appearing in the forward rate equation (3.2) are well-defined for \u03b7-a.e. T \u0105 0. The integrability requirements in parts (ii)-(iii)-(iv) of Assumption 3.3 ensure that ordinary and stochastic Fubini theorems can be applied, in the versions of (Veraar, 2012, Theorem 2.2) for Brownian integrals and (Bjo\u0308rk et al., 1997, Proposition A.2) for stochastic integrals with respect to the compensated random measure \u00b5\u0303.\nFor all 0 \u010f t \u010f T and x P E, we define\n\u03b1\u0304pt, T q :\u201c \u017c\nrt,T s \u03b1pt, uq\u03b7pduq,\n\u03c6\u0304pt, T q :\u201c \u017c\nrt,T s \u03c6pt, uq\u03b7pduq,\n\u03c8\u0304pt, x, T q :\u201c \u017c\nrt,T s \u03c8pt, x, uq\u03b7pduq,\nV\u0304 pt, T q :\u201c \u017c\nrt,T s \u2206V pt, uq\u03b7pduq.\nThe probability measure Q is a risk-neutral measure if P p\u00a8, T q{S0 is a local martingale under Q, for every T \u0105 0. The existence of a risk-neutral measure suffices to ensure absence of arbitrage, in the sense of no asymptotic free lunch with vanishing risk (NAFLVR, see Cuchiero et al. (2014)), for the large financial market where bonds of all maturities are traded. In turn, this ensures the validity of NAFLVR in the post-Libor market described in Section 2.2. We refer to Klein et al. (2016) and (Fontana et al., 2020, Section 6) for a detailed analysis of absence of arbitrage in interest rate markets.\nIn the proof of Theorem 3.5 below, we will use the following stochastic exponential representation of bond prices discounted by the nume\u0301raire S0.\n3This means that the map \u03b1p\u00a8, \u00a8q|r0,ts : \u2126 \u02c6 r0, ts \u02c6 R` \u00d1 R is pFt b Bpr0, tsq b BpR`qq-measurable, for all t P R`.\nLemma 3.4.

If Kp\u00a8, T q is a local martingale, it is also of locally integrable variation by (Jacod and Shiryaev, 2003, Lemma I.3.11). Since t\u2206Kp1qp\u00a8, T q \u2030 0u X t\u2206Kp2qp\u00a8, T q \u2030 0u \u201c H, it holds that |\u2206Kpiqp\u00a8, T q| \u010f |\u2206Kp\u00a8, T q|, for i \u201c 1, 2, and, therefore, both processes Kpiqp\u00a8, T q, i \u201c 1, 2, are of locally integrable variation. This implies that condition (3.5) holds and the random variable\ne\u00b4V\u0304 p\u03c4,T q\u03b4S p\u03c4q`pfp\u03c4,\u03c4q\u00b4\u03c1\u03c4 q\u03b4T p\u03c4q\nis sigma-integrable with respect to F\u03c4\u00b4, for all \u03c4 P S Y T (see (He et al., 1992, Theorem 5.28)). Taking into account the definition of V\u0304 pt, T q, equation (3.2) and the fact that pfp\u03c4\u00b4, \u03c4q \u00b4 \u03c1\u03c4\u00b4q\u03b4T p\u03c4q is F\u03c4\u00b4-measurable, the latter property is equivalent to the sigma-integrability of the random variable (3.6). Denoting by pKpiqp\u00a8, T q the compensator of Kpiqp\u00a8, T q, for i \u201c 1, 2, and making use of (He et al., 1992, Theorem 5.29), the local martingale property of Kp\u00a8, T q is then equivalent to the validity of\n0 \u201c \u017c \u00a8\n0 kps, T qds` pKp1qp\u00a8, T q \u201c\n\u017c \u00a8\n0\n\u02c6\nkps, T q ` \u017c\nE\n` e\u00b4\u03c8\u0304ps,x,T q \u00b4 1 ` \u03c8\u0304ps, x, T q \u02d8 \u03bbspdxq \u02d9 ds, (3.8)\n0 \u201c pKp2qp\u00a8, T q \u201c \u00ff\n\u03c4PSYT\n\u00b4\nE \u201c` e\u00b4V\u0304 p\u03c4,T q\u03b4S p\u03c4q`pfp\u03c4,\u03c4q\u00b4\u03c1\u03c4 q\u03b4T p\u03c4q \u02d8 \u02c7 \u02c7F\u03c4\u00b4 \u2030 \u00b4 1 \u00af 1rr\u03c4,8rr, (3.9)\nup to an evanescent set.

Taking T \u201c t in (3.10) yields condition (i), while condition (ii) follows by inserting condition (i) into (3.10). In view of (3.2) and the definition of V\u0304 pt, T q, equation (3.9) holds if and only if\nepfp\u03c4\u00b4,\u03c4q\u00b4\u03c1\u03c4\u00b4q\u03b4T p\u03c4qE \u201d e\u00b4 \u015f p\u03c4,T s \u2206V p\u03c4,uq\u03b7pduq\u03b4S p\u03c4q\u00b4\u2206\u03c1\u03c4\u03b4T p\u03c4q \u02c7 \u02c7\n\u02c7 F\u03c4\u00b4\n\u0131\n\u201c 1 a.s. (3.11)\nfor all \u03c4 P S Y T . Taking T \u201c \u03c4 in (3.11) yields condition (iii), while condition (iv) is then obtained by inserting condition (iii) into (3.11).\nConversely, if condition (3.5) is satisfied and the random variable in (3.6) is sigma-integrable, for every j \u201c 1, . . . ,M , then the compensator pKpiqp\u00a8, T q is well-defined, for i \u201c 1, 2. It is then straightforward to verify that if conditions (i)\u2013(iv) are satisfied, then equations (3.8)-(3.9) hold true. This implies that the process Kp\u00a8, T q given in (3.7) is a local martingale, thus proving the local martingale property of P p\u00a8, T q{S0, for every T \u011b 0. \u25a1\nIn the absence of stochastic discontinuities, it is well-known that P p\u00a8, T q{S0 is a local martingale if and only if the integrability requirement (3.5) and conditions (i)-(ii) of Theorem 3.5 hold, see (Bjo\u0308rk et al., 1997, Proposition 5.3). The presence of stochastic discontinuities is reflected in conditions (iii)-(iv) (together with the requirement of sigma-integrability of (3.6)). More specifically, condition (iii) relates the stochastic discontinuities T in the nume\u0301raire to the short end of the forward rate, while condition (iv) concerns the stochastic discontinuities S in the forward term rate. Taken together, conditions (iii)-(iv) exclude the possibility of predicting the size (or the direction) of the jump occurring at any discontinuity date, as this would be incompatible with absence of arbitrage (see Fontana et al. (2019) for an analysis of the arbitrage possibilities arising with predictable jumps).\nThe conditions of Theorem 3.5 admit a simplification under the following additional assumption.\nAssumption 3.6. The set tp\u03c9, tq P \u2126 \u02c6 T : \u2206\u03c1tp\u03c9q \u2030 0u is evanescent and S X T \u201c H.\nThis assumption corresponds to requiring that the RFR \u03c1 and the forward rates do not jump in correspondence of the roll-over dates of the nume\u0301raire S0. In this case, conditions (i) and (iii) can be\nrewritten in the following compact way: fpt, tq \u201c \u03c1t pQb \u03b7q-a.e.\nMoreover, under Assumption 3.6 the term \u2206\u03c1si\u03b4T psiq in condition (iv) vanishes.\nRemark 3.7 (Relation to Fontana et al. (2020)). The presence of the two distinct sets S and T of discontinuity dates distinguishes the present setup from the framework used for modelling multi-curve term structures in Fontana et al. (2020). For this reason, we have given full self-contained proofs of Lemma 3.4 and Theorem 3.5, which cannot be deduced in a straightforward way from Fontana et al. (2020). At the same time, we have simplified some of the original techniques of Fontana et al. (2020).\nThe next corollary provides the dynamics of the short end fpt, tq of the instantaneous forward rate. We omit the proof, which follows the same arguments of (Filipovic\u0301, 2009, Proposition 6.1).\nCorollary 3.8. Suppose that Assumption 3.3 holds. Assume furthermore that fp0, T q, \u03b1pt, T q, \u03c6pt, T q, \u03c8pt, x, T q are differentiable in T with \u015fT\n0 |Bufp0, uq|du \u0103 8, for all T \u011b 0, and such that conditions (ii), (iii), (iv) from Assumption 3.3 are satisfied for BT\u03b1pt, T q, BT\u03c6pt, T q, BT\u03c8pt, x, T q, respectively. Then it holds that\nfpt, tq \u201c fp0, 0q ` \u017c t\n0 \u03b6psqds`\n\u017c t\n0 \u03c6ps, sqdWs `\n\u017c t\n0\n\u017c\nE\n\u03c8ps, x, sq\u00b5\u0303pds, dxq ` V pt, tq,\nfor all t \u011b 0, where\n\u03b6psq :\u201c Bsfp0, sq ` \u03b1ps, sq ` \u017c s\n0 Bs\u03b1pu, sqdu`\n\u017c s\n0 Bs\u03c6pu, sqdWu `\n\u017c s\n0\n\u017c\nE\nBs\u03c8pu, x, sq\u00b5\u0303pdu, dxq\nand V pt, tq \u201c \u0159M j\u201c1 \u2206V psj , tq1tsj \u010ftu.\nRemark 3.9. In the classical HJM setup, the short end of the instantaneous forward rate is equal to the short rate, i.e., we have rt \u201c fpt, tq. In the presence of stochastic discontinuities, this must not necessarily be the case and absence of arbitrage implies only the equality fpt, tq \u201c \u03c1t pQ b dtq-a.e., as shown in Theorem 3.5 (i). It is interesting to see what happens if one assumes that the RFR \u03c1 is defined as the short end of the instantaneous forward rate by imposing\n\u03c1t :\u201c fpt, tq, for all t \u011b 0. (3.12) Condition (i) of Theorem 3.5 is of course automatically satisfied. Conditions (iii)-(iv) are equivalent to the validity of condition (3.9) in the proof of Theorem 3.5. Under (3.12), this condition becomes\nE \u201c e \u00b4\n\u015f\nrsi,T s \u2206V psi,uq\u03b7pduq\u02c7 \u02c7Fsi\u00b4 \u2030\n\u201c 1, for all i \u201c 1, . . . ,M. This in particular entails that, if all stochastic discontinuities in the model correspond only to rollover dates T (meaning that S \u201c H), then setting \u03c1 equal to the short end of the forward rate as in (3.12) implies that conditions (i), (iii) and (iv) of Theorem 3.5 hold and Q is a risk-neutral measure if and only if condition (ii) is satisfied, as in the classical HJM setup.\nTo illustrate the flexibility of the extended HJM approach, we show how a generalized version of the popular Cheyette model with stochastic discontinuities fits into our framework. In Section 4, we will develop an approach based on the philosophy of short-rate modelling.\nExample 3.10 (A Cheyette-style model). The Cheyette model is a Gaussian, multi-factor, Markovian model introduced in Cheyette (2001). This model class was independently considered also in Jamshidian (1991), Babbs (1993), Ritchken and Trevor (1992). We refer to Beyna (2013) for a detailed presentation of this class of models.\nIn this example, we illustrate an extension of the Cheyette model to a setup with stochastic discontinuities. We consider only the presence of the expected jump dates S, assuming T \u201c H for simplicity of presentation, so that S0 \u201c expp\n\u015f\u00a8 0 ru duq. We specify as follows the forward rates:\nfpt, T q \u201c fp0, T q ` \u017c t\n0 \u03b1ps, T qds`\n\u017c t\n0 \u03c6ps, T qdWs `\n\u00ff\nsi\u010ft\n` \u03b1ipT q ` \u03beigipT q \u02d8 ,\nwhere \u03b1, \u03c6, \u03b1i, gi, for i \u201c 1, . . . ,M , are deterministic functions and \u03bei \u201e N p\u00b5i, \u03c32i q, for i \u201c 1, . . . ,M , are independent normally distributed random variables which are also independent of W .\nThe central assumption underlying the Cheyette model corresponds to\n\u03c6pt, T q \u201c apT q aptq bptq,\nfor suitable functions a and b. This is a so-called separable volatility structure which allows separating t and T in the continuous part of the model. More precisely, denoting by f cp\u00a8, T q the continuous part of the process fp\u00a8, T q, we have that\nf cpt, T q \u201c fp0, T q ` apT q aptq X c t ` U cpt, T q, (3.13)\nwhere Xc is a mean-reverting Gaussian continuous Markov process with volatility function b and U cpt, T q is an explicitly known function, see (Beyna, 2013, Section 2.2).\nAnalogously, for the discontinuous part fdpt, T q of the forward rate it is natural to assume that gipT q \u201c BiApT q, for i \u201c 1, . . . ,M,\nfor suitable constants B1, . . . , BM and an integrable function A. Similarly as above, this separable structure leads to a representation of fdpt, T q analogous to (3.13). Indeed, defining the pure jump Markov process J :\u201c \u0159\nsi\u010f\u00a8 \u03beiBi, we obtain that\nfdpt, T q :\u201c \u00ff\nsi\u010ft\n` \u03b1ipT q ` \u03beigipT q \u02d8 \u201c Udpt, T q `ApT qJt, (3.14)\nwhere the explicit form of the function Udpt, T q can be deduced from condition (iv) of Theorem 3.5:\nUdpt, T q \u201c \u00ff\nsi\u010ft BiApT q\n` \u03c32iBiA\u0304psi, T q \u00b4 \u00b5i \u02d8 ,\nwith A\u0304psi, T q :\u201c \u015fT si Apuqdu, for all i \u201c 1, . . . ,M and T \u011b 0.\nIf in addition ap\u00a8q \u201c Ap\u00a8q, then combining equations (3.13) and (3.14) we directly obtain that\nfpt, T q \u201c fp0, T q ` apT q aptq Xt ` Upt, T q,\nwhere Xt :\u201c Xct ` aptqJt and Upt, T q :\u201c U cpt, T q ` Udpt, T q. Moreover, making use of equation (2.20) in Beyna (2013) and by means of straightforward computations, it can be proved that X is a mean-reverting Gaussian Markov jump-diffusion process with speed of mean reversion Bt logpaptqq, jumping only in correspondence with the predetermined stochastic discontinuities dates s1, . . . , sM . This example illustrates that the Cheyette model class can be easily extended to the case of stochastic discontinuities, retaining a remarkable level of analytical tractability."

            "heading": "4. The affine framework for overnight rate modelling",
            "text": "In this section, we present a modelling framework based on affine semimartingales. We focus here on the direct modelling of the overnight rate to provide a setup for developing extensions of the Hull-White and other affine models which are able to include stylized facts of overnight markets, namely spikes and jumps occurring at predetermined dates. Note that an affine specification of the HJM framework presented in Section 3 is also possible, leading to explicit conditions in Theorem 3.5.\nAffine semimartingales, as introduced in Keller-Ressel et al. (2019), generalize affine processes by allowing for discontinuities at fixed points in time with possibly state-dependent jump sizes and are therefore tailor-made to interest rate markets in the presence of overnight rates. We shortly introduce some general notions on affine semimartingales and then develop an affine model for overnight rates.\n4.1. Affine semimartingales. Consider a semimartingale X taking values in D :\u201c Rm` \u02c6 Rn. It is called affine when for all 0 \u010f t \u010f T \u0103 8 and u P U :\u201c Cm\u00b4 \u02c6 iRn,\nE \u201c exu,XT y|Ft \u2030 \u201c exp ` \u03d5tpT, uq ` x\u03c8tpT, uq, Xty \u02d8 , (4.1) where the functions \u03d5tpT, uq and \u03c8tpT, uq take values in C and Cd, respectively. We assume that convpsupppXtqq \u201c D, for all t \u0105 0, and that X is quasi-regular and infinitely divisible, in the sense that the regular conditional distribution QpXt P dx|Xsq is an infinitely divisible probability measure on D a.s. for all 0 \u010f s \u010f t \u0103 8.\nThe property that affine processes have affine semimartingale characteristics has a natural extension to the semimartingale case. More precisely, by (Keller-Ressel et al., 2019, Lemma 4.3 and\nTheorem 3.2), there is no loss of generality in assuming that X is a Markov process and the semimartingale characteristics pBX , CX , \u03bdXq of X with respect to a fixed truncation function h : Rd \u00d1 Rd, with d \u201c m ` n, have the following structure, where BX,c and \u03bdX,c denote the continuous parts of BX and \u03bdX , respectively:\nBX,ct \u201c \u017c t\n0\n\u00b4 \u03b2X0 psq ` d \u00ff\ni\u201c1 Xis\u00b4\u03b2 X i psq\n\u00af\nds,\nCXt \u201c \u017c t\n0\n\u00b4 \u03b1X0 psq ` d \u00ff\ni\u201c1 Xis\u00b4\u03b1 X i psq\n\u00af\nds,\n\u03bdX,cpdt, dxq \u201c \u00b4 \u00b5X0 pt, dxq ` d \u00ff\ni\u201c1 Xit\u00b4\u00b5 X i pt, dxq\n\u00af\ndt,\n\u017c\nD\npexu,xy \u00b4 1q\u03bdXpttu, dxq \u201c exp \u00b4 \u03b3X0 pt, uq ` d \u00ff\ni\u201c1 Xit\u00b4\u03b3 X i pt, uq\n\u00af\n\u00b4 1,\nwhere \u03b2Xi : R` \u00d1 Rd, \u03b1Xi : R` \u00d1 Sd, \u03b3Xi : R` \u02c6 U \u00d1 C, for i \u201c 0, 1, . . . , d, and p\u00b5Xi pt, \u00a8qqt\u011b0 is a family of Le\u0301vy measures on Dzt0u, with Sd denoting the cone of symmetric positive semidefinite d \u02c6 d matrices. In addition, it holds that \u03b3Xi pt, uq \u201c 0, for all i and for all pt, uq P pR`zJXq \u02c6 U , where JX :\u201c tt P R` : \u03bdXpttu, Dq \u2030 0u represents the set of stochastic discontinuity dates of the affine semimartingale X.\nThe functions \u03d5 and \u03c8 from equation (4.1) can now be described by the following generalized Riccati equations, see (Keller-Ressel et al., 2019, Theorem 3.2): first, for all pT, uq P R` \u02c6 U , the continuous parts \u03d5ctpT, uq and \u03c8ct pT, uq satisfy\nd\u03d5ctpT, uq dt \u201c \u00b4FXpt, \u03c8tpT, uqq, d\u03c8ct pT, uq dt \u201c \u00b4RXpt, \u03c8tpT, uqq,\nwhere the functions FX and RX are of Le\u0301vy-Khintchine form, for all i \u201c 1, . . . , d:\nFXpt, uq \u201c x\u03b2X0 ptq, uy ` 1 2xu, \u03b1 X 0 ptquy `\n\u017c\nDzt0u\n` exx,uy \u00b4 1 \u00b4 xhpxq, uy \u02d8 \u00b5X0 pt, dxq,\nRXi pt, uq \u201c x\u03b2Xi ptq, uy ` 1 2xu, \u03b1 X i ptquy `\n\u017c\nDzt0u\n` exx,uy \u00b4 1 \u00b4 xhpxq, uy \u02d8 \u00b5Xi pt, dxq.\nSecond, for all pT, uq P R` \u02c6 U , the discontinuous parts of \u03d5tpT, uq and \u03c8tpT, uq are determined by\n\u2206\u03d5tpT, uq \u201c \u00b4\u03b3X0 pt, \u03c8tpT, uqq, \u2206\u03c8tpT, uq \u201c \u00b4\u03b3\u0304Xpt, \u03c8tpT, uqq,\nwhere \u03b3\u0304Xpt, uq \u201c p\u03b3X1 pt, uq, . . . , \u03b3Xd pt, uqq P Rd. Finally, the terminal conditions are given by\n\u03d5T pT, uq \u201c 0 and \u03c8T pT, uq \u201c u.\nRemark 4.1. In order to be consistent with the framework of Section 3, we restrict our attention to affine semimartingales whose characteristics do not contain singular continuous parts. However, we point out that all results of this section can be generalized in a straightforward way to that case.\n4.2. Affine models for overnight rates. A widely used approach in interest rate theory consists in modelling the short rate and computing bond and derivative prices by risk-neutral valuation. If the short-rate model is sufficiently tractable (e.g., in the case of affine models as in (Duffie et al., 2003, Section 13)), then explicit valuation formulas for bond prices and interest rate derivatives can be obtained. In this section, we show how this short-rate approach can be extended to the case of affine semimartingales with stochastic discontinuities.\nWe assume that the RFR rate \u03c1 is given by\n\u03c1t \u201c \u2113ptq ` x\u039b, Xty, t \u011b 0, (4.2)\nwhere \u039b P Rd and \u2113 : R` \u00d1 R is a deterministic and ca\u0300dla\u0300g function such that \u015fT 0 |\u2113puq|\u03b7pduq \u0103 8, for all T \u0105 0, with measure \u03b7 from (2.3). The function \u2113 serves to fit the initially observed term structure of bond prices, similarly as in Brigo and Mercurio (2001).\nIn view of (4.1)-(4.2), the conditional characteristic function of the RFR is directly available. However, this does not suffice for the valuation of bonds and interest rate derivatives, since the discount factor and most types of payoffs depend on the integrated process R :\u201c\n\u015f\u00a8 0 \u03c1t \u03b7pdtq. The following\nproposition shows that the joint process pX,Rq is an affine semimartingale on the extended state space D \u02c6 R. This result, which can be considered of independent interest, represents a generalization to affine semimartingales of the enlargement of the state space approach of (Duffie et al., 2003, Section 11.2). The proof is technical and therefore postponed to the Appendix.\nProposition 4.2. Consider the pD \u02c6 Rq-valued process Y :\u201c pX,Rq. Then,\nE \u201c exu,XT y`vRT |Ft \u2030 \u201c exp ` \u03a6tpT, u, vq ` x\u03a8tpT, u, vq, Xty ` vRt \u02d8 , (4.3)\nfor all pu, vq P U \u02c6 iR and 0 \u010f t \u010f T , where the functions \u03a6tpT, u, vq and \u03a8tpT, u, vq take values in C and Cd, respectively, and solve the following generalized Riccati equations:\nd\u03a6ctpT, u, vq dt \u201c \u00b4FY pt,\u03a8tpT, u, vq, vq, d\u03a8ctpT, u, vq dt \u201c \u00b4RY pt,\u03a8tpT, u, vq, vq, (4.4)\nwith FY pt, u, vq \u201c FXpt, uq ` \u2113ptqv, RYi pt, u, vq \u201c RXi pt, uq ` \u039biv,\n(4.5)\nfor all i \u201c 1, . . . , d, and\n\u2206\u03a6tpT, u, vq \u201c \u00b4\u03b4T c ptq\u03b3X0 pt,\u03a8tpT, u, vqq \u00b4 \u03b4T ptq ` v\u2113ptq ` \u03b3X0 pt,\u03a8tpT, u, vq ` \u039bvq \u02d8 ,\n\u2206\u03a8tpT, u, vq \u201c \u00b4\u03b4T c ptq\u03b3\u0304Xpt,\u03a8tpT, u, vqq \u00b4 \u03b4T ptq ` v\u039b ` \u03b3\u0304Xpt,\u03a8tpT, u, vq ` \u039bvq \u02d8 , (4.6)\nsatisfying the terminal conditions\n\u03a6T pT, u, vq \u201c 0 and \u03a8T pT, u, vq \u201c u. (4.7)\nIn particular, the joint process pX,Rq is an affine infinitely divisible semimartingale.\nThe explicit characterization of the conditional Fourier transform of the joint process pX,Rq obtained in Proposition 4.2 allows for an efficient valuation of a variety of interest rate derivatives in the post-Libor environment. In particular, bonds can be priced by evaluating (4.3) at pu,wq \u201c p0,\u00b41q, whenever the expectation is finite. In turn, this leads to explicit pricing formulas for all linear derivatives such as swaps. Non-linear derivatives can be priced by relying on Fourier methods, analogously to the case of affine processes, see (Filipovic\u0301, 2009, Section 10.3) and Fontana (2023).\n4.3. A Hull-White model for the overnight rate. In this section, we present a tractable specification of an affine model for the overnight rate. More specifically, we generalize the Hull-White model to the case of stochastic discontinuities. We consider a finite set T \u201c tt1, . . . , tNu representing the roll-over dates of the nume\u0301raire S0, while S \u201c ts1, . . . , sMu denotes the set of expected jump dates of the RFR process.\nLet \u03c1 be the unique strong solution of the following stochastic differential equation:\nd\u03c1t \u201c ` \u03b1ptq ` \u03b2\u03c1t \u02d8 dt` \u03c3dWt ` dJt, (4.8)\nwhere \u03b1 : R \u00d1 R is a continuous function, \u03b2 P R, \u03c3 \u011b 0 and W \u201c pWtqt\u011b0 is a Brownian motion. The process J \u201c pJtqt\u011b0 in (4.8) is a pure jump process specified as follows:\nJ \u201c M \u00ff\ni\u201c1 \u03bei1rrsi,8rr, (4.9)\nwhere the random variables t\u03bei; i \u201c 1, . . . ,Mu are assumed to be independent of W . The following lemma gives the explicit solution to (4.8) and is an immediate consequence of Ito\u0302\u2019s formula.\nLemma 4.3. The solution \u03c1 \u201c p\u03c1tqt\u011b0 of the SDE (4.8) satisfies, for all 0 \u010f t \u010f T ,\n\u03c1T \u201c \u03c1te\u03b2pT\u00b4tq ` \u017c T\nt\ne\u03b2pT\u00b4sq\u03b1psqds` \u03c3e\u03b2T \u017c T\nt\ne\u00b4\u03b2sdWs ` M \u00ff\ni\u201c1 1tsiPpt,T su\u03be\nie\u03b2pT\u00b4siq. (4.10)\nAs illustrated in the following example, processes of the form (4.10), despite their simple structure, allow for different types of stochastic discontinuities that are in line with the empirical features of overnight rates, as discussed in the introduction (see Figure 1).\nExample 4.4 (A two-factor affine specification). Overnight rates are characterized by the presence of spikes and jumps, both potentially occurring at predetermined dates. While affine processes can exhibit a spiky behavior (e.g., shot-noise processes, see Schmidt (2008)), they do not accommodate spikes and jumps at predetermined dates. These features can be reproduced by affine semimartingales of the form (4.10). For the purpose of illustration, let \u03c11 and \u03c12 be two independent process satisfying (4.10), with parameters\n\u03c110 \u201c 0.01875, \u03b21 \u201c 0.20, \u03b11ptq \u201c \u03b11 \u201c 0.01, \u03c31 \u201c 0.012, \u03c120 \u201c 0, \u03b22 \u201c 80, \u03b12ptq \u201c \u03b12 \u201c 0, \u03c32 \u201c 0,\nfor all t \u011b 0. In this example, the process \u03c11 is assumed to have a single discontinuity at time s11 \u201c 150, while \u03c12 has discontinuity dates s21 \u201c 50 and s22 \u201c 100. We assume that all jump sizes are i.i.d. and distributed as N p0.1, 0.42q. Figure 2 shows a simulated path of the process \u03c1 :\u201c \u03c11 ` \u03c12. We can observe that \u03c1 exhibits spikes at t \u201c 50 and t \u201c 100 and a jump to a new level at t \u201c 150. The spiky behavior is generated by \u03c12, which has no diffusive component and very high mean-reversion speed (increasing \u03b22 further would produce even more pronounced spikes). The jump to a new level at t \u201c 150 is generated by the component \u03c11, which has a much slower mean-reversion.\nIn the next results, we shall make use of the following notation:\napt, T q :\u201c \u017c T\nt\ne\u03b2pT\u00b4sq\u03b1psqds.\nFor t \u201c 0, we simply write apT q :\u201c ap0, T q. In the following proposition, we compute the conditional characteristic function of the solution to SDE (4.10). While this result can be deduced from the general theory of affine semimartingales, we provide a direct proof exploiting the structure of (4.10).\nProposition 4.5. Let \u03c1 \u201c p\u03c1tqt\u011b0 be the solution of the SDE (4.10) and assume that the random variables t\u03bei; i \u201c 1, . . . ,Mu are independent. Then, for every u P iR and 0 \u010f t \u010f T , it holds that\nE \u201c eu\u03c1T \u02c7 \u02c7\u03c1t \u2030 \u201c exp ` \u03d5pu, t, T q ` \u03c8pu, T \u00b4 tq\u03c1t \u02d8 ,\nwhere\n\u03c8pu, T \u00b4 tq \u201c ue\u03b2pT\u00b4tq,\n\u03d5pu, t, T q \u201c u apt, T q ` pu\u03c3q 2\n4\u03b2 ` e2\u03b2pT\u00b4tq \u00b4 1 \u02d8 ` \u00ff i:siPpt,T s log\n\u00b4 E \u201d exppue\u03b2pT\u00b4siq\u03beiq \u0131\u00af .\nProof. From representation (4.10), we directly obtain that\nE \u201c eu\u03c1T \u02c7 \u02c7\u03c1t \u2030 \u201c exp ` ue\u03b2pT\u00b4tq\u03c1t \u02d8 \u00a8 exp \u02c6 u \u017c T\nt\ne\u03b2pt\u00b4sq\u03b1psqds` u 2\u03c32\n4\u03b2\n\u00b4 e2\u03b2pT\u00b4tq \u00b4 1 \u00af\n\u02d9\n\u00a8 E \u201e exp \u02c6 u M \u00ff\ni\u201c1 1tsiPpt,T su\u03be\nie\u03b2pT\u00b4siq \u02d9\u0237 .\nThis immediately yields that \u03c8pu, T \u00b4 tq \u201c u expp\u03b2pT \u00b4 tqq. The result of the proposition follows by relying on the independence of the random variables t\u03bei; i \u201c 1, . . . ,Mu. \u25a1\nExplicit expressions for bond prices can be obtained either by applying the general result from Proposition 4.2 or by a direct computation of the conditional characteristic function of the timeintegral \u015fT\n0 \u03c1t \u03b7pdtq, as illustrated in the next subsection under a specific assumption on the distribution of the jump sizes.\n4.4. A Gaussian Hull-White model for the overnight rate. Until the end of this section we assume that the random variables t\u03bei : i \u201c 1, . . . ,Mu are independent and normally distributed. In this case, we immediately see from (4.10) that \u03c1 is a Gaussian process (more precisely, a Markov process with Gaussian increments). Moreover, the random variable RT :\u201c \u015fT\n0 \u03c1t \u03b7pdtq is also normally distributed for all T \u0105 0. This immediately yields the following proposition.\nProposition 4.6. For all 0 \u010f t \u010f T , it holds that\nP pt, T q \u201c exp \u00b4 \u00b4 ErRT |\u03c1t, Rts `Rt ` 1 2 VarpRT |\u03c1t, Rtq \u00af .\nWe proceed to compute explicitly the conditional mean and variance ofRT appearing in Proposition 4.6. The proofs of the following two lemmata are based on rather lengthy computations and, therefore, are deferred to the Appendix. As a first step, we compute the conditional mean and covariance of \u03c1. We denote mi :\u201c Er\u03beis and \u03b32i :\u201c Varp\u03beiq, for each i \u201c 1, . . . ,M .\nLemma 4.7.

While \u03bei is the jump in the overnight rate at date si, its impact on bond prices is modulated by BpT \u00b4 siq ` \u0159N j\u201c1 1ttj Ppsi,T sue\n\u03b2ptj \u00b4siq in (4.14), with BpT \u00b4 siq defined in (4.13). In particular, since bond prices determine forward term rates, this allows generating forward term rates that exhibit less pronounced stochastic discontinuities than the overnight rate, in line with the empirical evidence in post-Libor markets based on overnight rates.\nRemark 4.10. In the present affine setup, the availability of exponentially affine formulas for bond prices implies that the backward-looking rate RpS, T q admits a tractable representation, being defined in (2.4) as a product of bond prices. This highlights the fact that our setting enables us to work with the exact definition of the backward-looking rate, while retaining complete analytical tractability.\nWe close this section by deriving an explicit formula for the price of a caplet in the context of the present Gaussian Hull-White model. In the post-Libor universe one may consider two distinct types of caplets, depending on whether the payoff is determined by the backward-looking rate RpS, T q or by the forward-looking rate F pS, T q, see for instance Lyashenko and Mercurio (2019), Fontana (2023). For illustration, we consider here a forward-looking caplet, whose payoff at date T is given by\nH \u201c pT \u00b4 Sq ` F pS, T q \u00b4K \u02d8` ,\nfor some K \u0105 0. We recall from Section 2.2.3 that F pS, T q \u201c RpS, S, T q \u201c p1{P pS, T q \u00b4 1q{pT \u00b4 Sq.

            "text": "The presence of stochastic discontinuities may induce market incompleteness, in the sense that perfect replication of payoffs by means of self-financing strategies is not always possible. This is for instance the case of the affine model of Section 4.3, which is affected by the jump risk generated by the process J . In this section, we aim at determining optimal hedging strategies in the sense of local risk-minimization. This corresponds to attaining perfect replication of payoffs while relaxing the self-financing requirement and minimizing the cost of the strategy according to a quadratic criterion (see Pham (2000) and Schweizer (2001) for an overview of the theory). In Section 5.1 we provide a general description of local risk-minimization with stochastic discontinuities, while in Section 5.2 we study an explicit example in the context of the Gaussian Hull-White model of Section 4.4.\n5.1. Local risk-minimization with stochastic discontinuities. In order to reduce the technicalities in the presentation and to focus on the impact of stochastic discontinuities, we assume the validity of the following assumption. We consider a finite time horizon T .\nAssumption 5.1. There exists a family p\u03be1, . . . , \u03beM q of random variables on p\u2126,F , Qq taking values in a measurable space pB,BpBqq such that \u03bei is Fsi -measurable, for each i \u201c 1, . . . ,M , and every local martingale N \u201c pNtqtPr0,T s on p\u2126,F, Qq admits a representation of the following form:\nN \u201c N0 ` \u017c \u00a8\n0 \u03b8tdWt `\nM \u00ff i\u201c1 fip\u03beiq1rrsi,T ss, (5.1)\nwhere \u03b8 P L2locpr0, T sq and fip\u00a8q : \u2126 \u02c6 B \u00d1 R is a pFsi\u00b4 b BpBqq-measurable function such that Erfip\u03beiq|Fsi\u00b4s \u201c 0 a.s., for each i \u201c 1, . . . ,M .\nAssumption 5.1 is for instance satisfied in the model of Section 4.3 if the filtration F is generated by the pair pW,Jq. Note that the assumption that the discontinuity dates T do not appear in the martingale representation (5.1) is only made for simplicity of presentation.\nWe suppose that the market contains a traded security with S0-discounted price process X \u201c pXtqtPr0,T s, assumed to be a special semimartingale with canonical decomposition\nX \u201c X0 `A`M, (5.2) where A \u201c pAtqtPr0,T s is a predictable process of finite variation and M \u201c pMtqtPr0,T s a squareintegrable martingale, with A0 \u201c M0 \u201c 0. The process X can represent for instance the price process of a SOFR future contract, at present the most liquid product referencing SOFR (see Section 5.2). Note also that in this section we do not necessarily assume that Q is a risk-neutral measure.\nAs a consequence of Assumption 5.1, the martingale M admits a representation of the form\nM \u201c \u017c \u00a8\n0 \u03b7udWu `\n\u00ff\nsi\u010f\u00a8 \u2206Msi , (5.3)\nwhere \u03b7 \u201c p\u03b7tqtPr0,T s is a predictable process such that Er \u015fT 0 \u03b7 2 udus \u0103 8 and \u2206Msi \u201c wip\u03beiq, where the function wi is as in Assumption 5.1, for each i \u201c 1, . . . ,M . We furthermore assume that X has non-vanishing volatility, in the sense that \u03b7t \u0105 0 a.s. for all t P r0, T s.\nBy absence of arbitrage, there exists a predictable process \u03bb \u201c p\u03bbtqtPr0,T s such thatA \u201c \u015f\u00a8 0 \u03bbudxMyu. In particular, this implies that \u2206Asi \u201c \u03bbsiErp\u2206Msi q2|Fsi\u00b4s, for all i \u201c 1, . . . , N . We furthermore\nassume that the expected mean-variance tradeoff is finite, i.e., Er \u015fT 0 \u03bb 2 udxMyus \u0103 8. This corresponds to assuming that X satisfies the structure condition (see Schweizer (2001)). LetH be a square-integrable FT -measurable random variable, representing a discounted payoff. By market incompleteness, H may not be attainable by self-financing trading. We then consider non-selffinancing strategies attaining the payoff H, as formalized in the following definition, where we denote by \u0398 the set of all predictable processes \u03b6 \u201c p\u03b6tqtPr0,T s such that Er \u015fT 0 \u03b6 2 udxMyu`p \u015fT 0 |\u03b6udAu|q 2s \u0103 8.\nDefinition 5.2. We call H-admissible strategy a pair \u03c6 \u201c p\u03b6, V q, where \u03b6 \u201c p\u03b6tqtPr0,T s P \u0398 and V \u201c pVtqtPr0,T s is an adapted square-integrable process such that VT \u201c H a.s. We say that an H-admissible strategy \u03c6 \u201c p\u03b6, V q is locally risk-minimizing if the associated cost process\nCtp\u03c6q :\u201c Vt \u00b4 \u017c t\n0 \u03b6udXu, for all t P r0, T s,\nis a square-integrable martingale strongly orthogonal to M .\nIn Definition 5.2, \u03b6t and Vt represent respectively the positions held in the traded security and the portfolio value at time t, for all t P r0, T s. By (Schweizer, 2001, Theorem 3.3), the definition of locally risk-minimizing strategy adopted in Definition 5.2 is equivalent to the original definition of Schweizer (1991) if the process A in (5.2) is continuous, as in the case of the example considered in Section 5.2. For general A, Definition 5.2 corresponds to the so-called pseudo-locally risk-minimizing strategy.\nIn view of (Schweizer, 2001, Proposition 3.4), finding a locally risk-minimizing strategy \u03c6 \u201c p\u03b6, V q corresponds to obtaining a decomposition of the payoff H of the form\nH \u201c H0 ` \u017c T\n0 \u03b6Hu dXu ` LHT , (5.4)\nwhere \u03b6H \u201c p\u03b6Ht qtPr0,T s P \u0398 and LH \u201c pLHt qtPr0,T s is a square-integrable martingale strongly orthogonal to M with LH0 \u201c 0. Decomposition (5.4) is known as the Fo\u0308llmer-Schweizer decomposition of H and a locally risk-minimizing strategy is then given by p\u03b6H , V Hq, where V H :\u201c H0 ` \u015f\u00a8 0 \u03b6 H u dXu `LH .\nUnder Assumption 5.1, we can explicitly derive decomposition (5.4) for a generic discounted payoff H. To this effect, let us define pZ :\u201c E p\u00b4\n\u015f\u00a8 0 \u03bbudMuq and assume that pZ is a strictly positive square-\nintegrable martingale under Q. This enables us to define the minimal martingale measure pQ by d pQ \u201c pZT dQ. We can then define the pQ-martingale pH \u201c p pHtqtPr0,T s by\npHt :\u201c pErH|Fts, for all t P r0, T s, where we denote by pE the expectation with respect to pQ. By Bayes\u2019 formula, it holds that pH \u201c N{ pZ, with Nt :\u201c Er pZTH|Fts, for all t P r0, T s.

We are now in a position to state the following theorem.\nTheorem 5.3. Suppose that Assumption 5.1 holds and assume that pZ as defined above is a strictly positive square-integrable martingale under Q. Let H be an FT -measurable random variable and suppose that suptPr0,T s pHt P L2pQq.

In turn, the latter property is equivalent to Er\u2206LHsi \u2206Msi |Fsi\u00b4s \u201c 0 a.s., for all i \u201c 1, . . . ,M .

In particular, formula (5.6) shows that the locally risk-minimizing strategy consists in a perfect replication at all times t P r0, T szS, when the only active source of randomness is the Brownian motion W . The first term on the right-hand side of (5.6) corresponds to the Delta-hedging continuous strategy. On the other hand, in correspondence of the expected jump dates S \u201c ts1, . . . , sMu, the strategy \u03b6Hsi is determined by a linear regression of \u2206 pHsi onto \u2206Xsi , conditionally on Fsi\u00b4.

We also remark that the associated cost process Cp\u03c6Hq is generated by the residuals of the regressions (5.8).\n5.2. An example. In this section, we illustrate the hedging approach described in Section 5.1 in the case of a forward-looking caplet using an RFR future as hedging instrument. This choice is motivated by the fact that, at the time of writing, SOFR futures represent the most liquidly traded products written on SOFR, while caps/floors are less liquid in the market.\nWe consider the model of Section 4.3, with Q playing now the role of the physical probability measure:\nd\u03c1t \u201c p\u03b1ptq ` \u03b2\u03c1tqdt` \u03c3dWt ` dJt, (5.9) where J is defined as in (4.9), where the random variables t\u03bei : i \u201c 1, . . . ,Mu are independent and independent of W , with distribution N pmi, \u03b32i q under Q, for each i \u201c 1, . . . ,M . For simplicity of presentation, in this subsection we assume that \u03b7pdtq \u201c dt (i.e., there are no roll-over dates).\nAs traded security, we consider a futures contract with reference period rS, T s, for some S \u0103 T . We denote by fpt, S, T q the corresponding futures rate at date t, for t P r0, Ss, and define\nBpt, S, T q :\u201c BpT \u00b4 tq \u00b4BpS \u00b4 tq T \u00b4 S \u201c e\u03b2pT\u00b4tq \u00b4 e\u03b2pS\u00b4tq pT \u00b4 Sq\u03b2 , for all t P r0, Ss.\nWe assume that the futures rate fp\u00a8, S, T q satisfies the following dynamics under Q:\ndfpt, S, T q \u201c hptqdt`Bpt, S, T q\u03c3dWt `Bpt, S, T qd rJt, (5.10)\nwhere rJ denotes the compensated jump process defined as rJt :\u201c Jt\u00b4 \u0159m i\u201c1 1tsi\u010ftumi, for all t P r0, T s, and h : r0, T s \u00d1 R is a bounded deterministic function. The local martingale part M of the discounted futures price process can be written as in (5.3), with\n\u03b7t \u201c pS0t q\u00b41Bpt, S, T q\u03c3 and \u2206Msi \u201c pS0si q \u00b41Bpsi, S, T qp\u03bei \u00b4miq, (5.11)\nfor all t P r0, Ss and i \u201c 1, . . . ,M . In the present setting, pZ :\u201c E p\u00b4\n\u015f\u00a8 0 hpuq{p\u03c3Bpu, S, T qqdWuq is a square-integrable strictly positive\nmartingale and, therefore, the minimal martingale measure pQ is given by d pQ \u201c pZT dQ. By Girsanov\u2019s theorem, the process xW \u201c pxWtqtPr0,T s defined by xWt \u201c Wt` \u015ft\n0 hpuq{p\u03c3Bpu, S, T qqdu, for all t P r0, T s, is a Brownian motion under pQ. Note that in the context of the present example the change of measure from Q to pQ leaves invariant all the properties of the random variables t\u03bei : i \u201c 1, . . . ,Mu.\nRemark 5.4. In the context of the model of Section 4.3, the futures rate fpt, S, T q can be explicitly computed. Suppose that, in line with the market convention for 1-month RFR futures contracts, the futures contract settles at date T at a rate quoted as pRT \u00b4RSq{pT \u00b4 Sq. By risk-neutral valuation under the minimal martingale measure pQ, it holds that\nfpt, S, T q \u201c pErRT \u00b4RS |Fts\nT \u00b4 S , for all t P r0, Ss.\nSimilarly as in Section 4.3, under the minimal martingale measure pQ it holds that\nRT \u00b4Rt \u201c \u03c1tBpT \u00b4 tq ` pApt, T q ` \u03c3 \u017c T\nt\nBpT \u00b4 sqdxWs ` M \u00ff\ni\u201c1 1tsiPpt,T suBpT \u00b4 siq\u03bei,\nwhere pApt, T q :\u201c \u015fT\nt \u03b1\u0302psqBpT \u00b4 sqds, for all t P r0, T s, with \u03b1\u0302ptq :\u201c \u03b1ptq \u00b4hptq{Bpt, S, T q denoting the\ndeterministic drift term in the dynamics of \u03c1 under pQ. The futures rate fpt, S, T q admits then the following representation:\nfpt, S, T q \u201c \u03c1tBpt, S, T q` pApt, T q \u00b4 pApt, Sq T \u00b4 S ` M \u00ff\ni\u201c1 1tsiPpt,SsuBpsi, S, T qmi`\nM \u00ff i\u201c1 1tsiPpS,T su BpT \u00b4 siq T \u00b4 S mi.\nWe suppose that the payoff H to be hedged corresponds to an RFR caplet with discounted payoff\nH :\u201c pT \u00b4 Sq ` F pS, T q \u00b4K \u02d8`{S0T ,\nfor some K \u0105 0, as considered in Section 4.4. To determine the locally risk-minimizing strategy, we first need to compute the price process pH \u201c p pHtqtPr0,T s of the payoff H under the measure pQ. This can be achieved by a direct application of Proposition 4.12, leading to\npHt \u201c Gp\u03c1t, t, S, T,Kq{S0t ,\nwhere the function Gp\u03c1t, t, S, T,Kq is explicitly given in Proposition 4.12, replacing Apt, Sq by pApt, Sq in the definition of the quantity \u039epS, T q and \u03b1psq by \u03b1\u0302psq in the definition of \u03931pt, Sq.\nIn view of Theorem 5.3, the component \u03b6H of the locally risk-minimizing strategy \u03c6H is determined by two terms: a first term representing the continuous Delta-hedging strategy and an additional term that takes into account the expected jump dates S \u201c ts1, . . . , sMu.\nProposition 5.5. Suppose that Assumption 5.1 holds. Consider a caplet delivering at date T the payoff pT \u00b4 SqpF pS, T q \u00b4 Kq`, for S P r0, T s and K \u0105 0. The locally risk-minimizing strategy \u03c6H \u201c p\u03b6H , vHq is determined by the process \u03b6H \u201c p\u03b6Ht qtPr0,T s defined by\n\u03b6Ht \u201c \u03b6 H,c t \u03b4Sc ptq ` \u03b6 H,d t \u03b4Sptq, for all t P r0, T s\nwhere, for all i \u201c 1, . . . ,M ,\n\u03b6H,ct \u201c \u00b4Gp\u03c1t, t, S, T,KqBpT \u00b4 tq `BpT \u00b4 Sqe\u03b2pS\u00b4tqP pt, Sq\u03a6pd1p\u03c1tqq\nBpt, S, T q , (5.12)\n\u03b6H,dsi \u201c ErGpy ` \u03bei, si, S, T,Kqp\u03bei \u00b4miqs|y\u201c\u03c1si\u00b4\nBpsi, S, T q\u03b32i . (5.13)\nProof. For brevity of notation, let us denote Gpx, tq :\u201c Gpx, t, S, T,Kq, for all px, tq P R \u02c6 r0, Ss. As follows from the proof of Theorem 5.3, the first term on the right-hand side of (5.6), corresponding to \u03b6H,c, is determined by the diffusive part of the process pH. To this effect, we compute\nBGpx, tq Bx \u201c \u00b4BpS \u00b4 tqGpx, tq `BpT \u00b4 Sqe \u03b2pS\u00b4tq`e\u00b4xBpS\u00b4tq\u00b4\u039ept,Sq\u03a6pd1pxqq \u00b4Gpx, tq \u02d8\n\u201c \u00b4Gpx, tqBpT \u00b4 tq `BpT \u00b4 Sqe\u03b2pS\u00b4tqe\u00b4xBpS\u00b4tq\u00b4\u039ept,Sq\u03a6pd1pxqq.\nIn view of equations (5.9) and (5.11), it follows that the first component \u03b6H,ct of the locally riskminimizing strategy is given by (5.12). To compute the second term on the right-hand side of equation (5.6), corresponding to \u03b6H,dt , observe that, in view of equation (5.11),\n\u03b6H,dsi \u201c Er\u2206 pHsi\u2206Msi |Fsi\u00b4s Erp\u2206Msi q2|Fsi\u00b4s \u201c Er pHsi\u2206Msi |Fsi\u00b4s Erp\u2206Msi q2|Fsi\u00b4s \u201c ErGp\u03c1si , si, S, T,Kqp\u03bei \u00b4miq|Fsi\u00b4s Bpsi, S, T q Varp\u03bei|Fsi\u00b4q ,\nfor i \u201c 1, . . . ,M . Due to the independence of the random variables t\u03bei : i \u201c 1, . . . ,Mu, it holds that\n\u03b6H,dsi \u201c ErGp\u03c1si\u00b4 ` \u03bei, si, S, T,Kqp\u03bei \u00b4miqs\npS0si q\u00b41Bpsi, S, T q\u03b3 2 i\n, for all i \u201c 1, . . . ,M,\nfrom which (5.13) follows due to the independence of the random variables t\u03bei, i \u201c 1, . . . ,Mu from the Brownian motion W . Finally, it remains to verify that suptPr0,Ss pHt P L2pQq and \u03b6L P \u0398. The first property can be shown to hold since pHt \u010f P pt, Sq for all t P r0, Ss and by means of standard estimates together with an application of Doob\u2019s maximal inequality. The fact that \u03b6L P \u0398 follows by noting that the integral Er \u015fS\n0 p\u03b6 H u q2dxMyus can be reduced to the integration of continuous functions\non the compact domain r0, Ss and that the function h in (5.10) is assumed to be bounded. \u25a1\nRemark 5.6. In the context of a Vasic\u030cek-type model, Rutkowski and Bickersteth (2021) derive an explicit replication strategy for a SOFR caplet based on SOFR futures. This is possible since their model is driven by a single source of randomness represented by a standard Brownian motion. In contrast, in our setting the presence of jumps at predetermined dates does not allow for perfect replication, thereby justifying the use of local risk-minimization."

Since the affine semimartingale X satisfies by assumption the conditions of (Keller-Ressel et al., 2019, Proposition 5.2), its associated enhanced parameter set is admissible, in the sense of (Keller-Ressel et al., 2019, Definition 5.1). In turn, this implies that the enhanced parameter set of Y , determined by p\u03b2\u0303Y , \u03b1\u0303Y , \u00b5\u0303Y q as defined above, is also admissible. Therefore, by (Keller-Ressel et al., 2019, Theorem 5.7), on the canonical stochastic basis p\u21261,F 1, pF 1tqt\u011b0, P 1q there exists an infinitely divisible Markov process Y 1 \u201c pY 1t qt\u011b0 with Y 10 \u201c px, 0q that is an affine semimartingale with characteristics pBY , CY , \u03bdY q as computed above. Since the two Markov processes Y \u201c pX,Rq and Y 1 have the same characteristics and the process Y 1 is unique in law, it follows that Y \u201c pX,Rq and Y 1 have the same law (compare with (Duffie et al., 2003, Lemmata 10.1 and 10.2)). Denoting by E1 the expectation under the measure P 1, this implies that\nErexw,YT ys \u201c E1rexw,Y 1 T ys \u201c e\u03a60pT,wq`x\u03a80pT,wq,xy, (A.2)\nfor all w \u201c pu, vq P U \u02c6 iR and 0 \u010f t \u010f T \u0103 8, where the functions \u03a60pT,wq and \u03a80pT,wq are solution to (4.4)-(4.7), as follows from (Keller-Ressel et al., 2019, Theorem 3.1) together with the specific structure of the characteristics pBY , CY , \u03bdY q computed in the first part of the proof. The conditional version of the Fourier transform (4.3) follows from (A.2) by relying on the Markov property of Y on the stochastic basis p\u2126,F , pFtqt\u011b0, P q. \u25a1\nProof of Lemma 4.7. Firstly, taking expectation of equation (4.10) immediately yields mpt, T q and thus (4.11). Regarding the covariance, for the continuous part we note that\nE\n\u201e \u017c T1\nt\ne\u03b2pT1\u00b4uqdWu \u00a8 \u017c T2\nt\ne\u03b2pT2\u00b4vqdWv\n\u0237 \u201c \u017c T1^T2\nt\ne\u03b2pT1`T2\u00b42uqdu \u201c e \u03b2pT1`T2q\n2\u03b2\n\u00b4 e\u00b42\u03b2t \u00b4 e\u00b42\u03b2pT1^T2q \u00af .\nNext, we compute the conditional covariance of the jumps:\nCov \u00b4\nM \u00ff i\u201c1 1tsiPpt,T1sue \u03b2pT1\u00b4siq\u03bei, M \u00ff i\u201c1 1tsiPpt,T2sue \u03b2pT2\u00b4siq\u03bei \u02c7 \u02c7 \u02c7 \u03c1t \u00af \u201c M \u00ff i\u201c1 1tsiPpt,T1^T2sue \u03b2pT1`T2\u00b42siq Varp\u03beiq.\nPutting the two parts together we obtain (4.11). l\nProof of Lemma 4.8.
