These have provided trong evidence for the long-term evolution of the scaling relations etween various properties of galaxies. Nevertheless, the relationship etween the evolution of individual galaxies and the evolution of caling relations as a whole is not yet well-understood. Unlike stellar volution, where the evolution track of a star with a given mass can e clearly defined, we do not yet have a credible model for tracing he evolution of individual galaxies.\nE-mail: wangy18@pcl.ac.cn (YW); napolitano@mail.sysu.edu.cn (NRN); ixiaod25@mail.sysu.edu.cn (XDL)\nn S i o\n2022 The Author(s) ublished by Oxford University Press on behalf of Royal Astronomical Society\nAmong all galaxy properties, the star formation rate (SFR) plays critical role in the evolution of galaxies. The SFR is shown to be ightly connected to the galaxy stellar mass, M \u2217, as SF R \u221d M \u03b2\u2217 , ith \u03b2 \u223c 1 up to at least z = 3 (Brinchmann et al. 2004 ; Daddi et al. 007 ; Elbaz et al. 2007 ; Noeske et al. 2007 ). The linear relationship etween the logarithm of stellar mass and the logarithm of SFR is lso referred to as the galaxy main sequence (MS). Observations ndicate that the intercept of MS evolves with redshift as \u223c(1 + ) 2.2 (Pannella et al. 2009 ; Stark et al. 2013 ; Schreiber et al. 2015 ; oogaard et al. 2018 ). The increase of intercept with time indicates higher specific star formation rate, which is most likely caused y the higher accretion rate of cold gas at high redshifts (Lilly t al. 2013 ; Tacchella, Trenti & Carollo 2013 ; Genzel et al. 2015 ; acchella et al. 2018 ; Cui et al. 2021 ). The scatter of the MS is small, bout 0.2\u20130.4 dex, and steady across time, indicating that there is o strong evidence of evolution with redshift (Whitaker et al. 2012 ; peagle et al. 2014 ; Schreiber et al. 2015 ). This stability of the MS s interpreted as the outcome of quasi-steady state of gas inflow, utflow, and consumption during galaxies\u2019 evolution (Bouch \u0301e et al.\nM\n2 D\nb o d T t e r p i\ni s ( p w t 2 a v d 2 e fi S i 2 l ( ( f c 2 e 2\nt g b l F z 2 a r ( o fl t t g I s e h p e b a t d\no o b a o\nm S f t p ( r p p v w p p r a s\nu i S f t t F t\n2\nT T h\n2\nT a M i a t a v t o v b 6 o o o t c A c\n1 ht tps://the300-project .org\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/515/3/3249/6643333 by U niversity of W estern Australia user on 31 August 2022\n010 ; Daddi et al. 2010 ; Dav \u0301e, Finlator & Oppenheimer 2012 ; ekel & Mandelker 2014 ; Rodr \u0301\u0131guez-Puebla et al. 2016 ). The abo v e-mentioned MS features describe a statistical mean ehaviour of the galaxies while the physics involved in the history f each individual galaxy suffers from various perturbations, causing eviations from the mean relations for the quantities of galaxies. hese variations appear to be dispersed randomly distributed (alhough it is possible that they are not random). Additionally, SFH ncodes the information pertaining to these physics. Hence, we easonably expect that we can gain additional knowledge about this hysics if we would be able to model relatively precise SFHs of ndividual galaxies.\nSo far, there have been numerous approaches to modelling ndividual galaxies\u2019 SFHs. One popular method is utilizing the tellar population synthesis and the spectral energy distribution SED) fitting. A galaxy\u2019s SED contains information about its stellar opulations within a galaxy. Using specific models parametrized ith the stellar population parameters like age, metallicity, and he timing of star formation episodes (see e.g. Bruzual & Charlot 003 ), SED fitting provides a metric to optimize the parameters nd consequently build up the SFH. This approach, ho we ver, is ery challenging because the fitting process contains numerous e generacies (P apo vich, Dickinson & Ferguson 2001 ; Shaple y et al. 001 ; Muzzin et al. 2009 ; Conroy 2013 ; Carnall et al. 2019 ; Leja t al. 2019 ). For instance, Ge et al. ( 2018 ) found that the SED t may be largely biased for dust-rich galaxies. Furthermore, the ED modelling can only reproduce the o v erall shapes of SFH but gnoring short-time variations (Ocvirk et al. 2006 ; Gallazzi et al. 009 ; Zibetti, Charlot & Rix 2009 ; Leja et al. 2019 ). These latter eave their imprint on the destruction of giant molecular clouds GMCs), SN feedback, cosmic rays, and photoionization feedbacks Iyer et al. 2020 ; Tacchella, Forbes & Caplar 2020 ). To compensate or this deficiency, dedicated investigations have been conducted to haracterize these short-time-scale variations in SFH (Sulli v an et al. 000 ; Boselli et al. 2009 ; Wuyts et al. 2011 ; Guo et al. 2016 ; Emami t al. 2018 ; Broussard et al. 2019 ; Faisst et al. 2019 ; Wang & Lilly 020 a , b ; ChavesMontero & Hearin 2021 ). Another way to study SFH is by using hydrodynamic simulaions, which can follow the formation and evolution of individual alaxies in a self-consistent manner. In recent years, there have een many extensive studies about SFH predictions, utilizing a arge number of hydrodynamic cosmology and zoom-in simulations. or e xample, Tacchella et al. ( 2016 ) investigated the SFH in the oom-in simulations VELA (Ceverino et al. 2014 ; Zolotov et al. 015 ) and disco v ered a tight correlation between the SFH variation nd the gas processes such as gas compaction, depletion, and eplenishment. Based on the EAGLE simulation, Schaye et al. 2015 ) and Matthee & Schaye ( 2019 ) have found that the scatter f MS comes from a combination of short- and long-time-scale uctuations in SFHs. The short-time-scale fluctuations are related o self-regulation from cooling, star formation and outflows, while he long-time-scale fluctuations are due to the dark matter halo rowth. Similar conclusions have been made and discussed in llustris (Sparre et al. 2015 ), IllustrisTNG (Torrey et al. 2018 ), FIRE imulation (Sparre et al. 2017 ), and the NIHAO simulation (Blank t al. 2021 ). Ho we ver, dif ferent sub-grid physics implementations in ydrodynamic simulation can result in significantly different SFH redictions across hydrodynamic simulations. Iyer et al. ( 2020 ), for xample, has analysed the power spectrum density of individual SFH ased on six cosmological simulations, two zoom-in simulations, nd additional semi-analytic and empirical models. They discovered hat there are obvious discrepancies between the SFHs produced by if ferent simulations/models, e ven though the stellar mass function\nNRAS 515, 3249\u20133269 (2022)\nf galaxies in these simulations and models all accord well with bservations. Therefore, further impro v ement of the recipes for aryon models in hydrodynamic simulations is still required, and deeper understanding of the physics behind the SFHs can help us n this endea v or. In this paper, we present a mathematical model that can be used to imic the evolution tracks of galaxies\u2019 SFHs in simulations. When FHs are described in a universal form, comparisons between SFHs rom different simulations become easier. In our model, we make he basic assumption that an individual galaxy SFH follows a simple attern: (1) it grows in lockstep with the trend of the main sequence hence abbreviated as \u2018MS part\u2019, denoted as MS ); (2) it evolves andomly from there, producing a path that deviates from the MS art and follows a Brownian motion (hence abbreviated as \u2018variation art\u2019, denoted as ). Moti v ated by Kelson ( 2014 ), we simulate the ariation part using fractional Brownian motion. A similar attempt as made by Caplar & Tacchella ( 2019 ), who proposed a stochastic rocess model for the variation of SFH characterized by a broken ower law. We validate this model by applying it to galaxy cluster e-simulation The Three Hundred (hereafter THETHREEHUNDRED , lso abbreviated as \u2018The300\u2019), the simulation Illustris-1, and the imulation TNG100-1.\nThis paper is structured as follows: We describe the data that we tilize in Section 2 . We construct the model in Section 3 , which s divided into two parts: Section 3.1 generates the MS part of the FH model based on the evolution of SFR \u2212 M \u2217 scale relations rom simulations; Section 3.2 generates the stochastic model for he variation part of the SFH. We merge two parts in Section 3.3 o build up a complete SFH model and assess its performance. inally, Section 4 summarizes our model\u2019s findings and discusses heir validity and future direction.\nSIMULA T I O N DA TA\nhe simulation data from THETHREEHUNDRED , Illustris-1, and NG100-1, as well as the methods to measure the star formation istory of simulated galaxies, are briefly introduced in this section.\n.1 THETHREEHUNDRED\nHE THREE HUNDRED project 1 consists of 324 re-simulated clusters nd 4 field re gions e xtracted from the MultiDark Planck simulation, DPL2 (Klypin et al. 2016 ). The MDPL2 simulation has cosmologcal parameters of M = 0.307, B = 0.048, = 0.693, h = 0.678, nd \u03c3 8 = 0.823. All the clusters and fields have been simulated using he full-ph ysics h ydrodynamic codes GADGET-X (Rasia et al. 2015 ) nd GADGET-MUSIC (Sembolini et al. 2013 ), which are impro v ed ersions of GADGET2 (Springel 2005 ). In the re-simulation region, he mass of a dark matter particle is 12.7 \u00d7 10 8 h \u22121 M and the mass f a gas particle is 2.36 \u00d7 10 8 h \u22121 M . The mass of star particles aries from 3.60 \u00d7 10 7 to 1.65 \u00d7 10 8 h \u22121 M with 99 per cent of them eing less massive than 4.60 \u00d7 10 7 h \u22121 M . The softening length is . 5 h \u22121 kpc . Each cluster re-simulation consists of a spherical region f radius 15h \u22121 Mpc at z = 0 centred on one of the 324 largest bjects within the host MDPL2 simulation box, which is 1h \u22121 Gpc n a side. The host haloes of galaxies range in mass from 2.54 \u00d7 10 10 o 2.63 \u00d7 10 15 h \u22121 M . The largest haloes within each of the 324 luster re-simulations vary from 8.15 \u00d7 10 14 to 2.63 \u00d7 10 15 h \u22121 M . more detailed description of the 324 clusters and the simulation odes can be found in Cui et al.

It employs the moving\nesh code AREPO (Springel 2010 ). Its cosmological parameters are onsistent with WMAP9 data release (Hinshaw et al. 2013 ), i.e. = .7274, m = 0.2726, b = 0.0456, \u03c3 8 = 0.809, n s = 0.963, and = 0.704. The simulation contains 1820 3 dark matter particles and 1820 3 nitial hydrodynamic cells. The mass resolution of dark matter articles is 6.26 \u00d7 10 6 M and the initial mass resolution of baryons s 1.26 \u00d7 10 6 M . The simulation evolves the initial condition rom redshift 127\u20130 with 136 output snapshots. Besides gravitation, t accounts for hydrodynamics and baryon processes such as gas ooling and photo-ionization, star formation, ISM model, stellar volution, stellar feedback, and AGN feedback. The star formation istories are provided by the SubLink merger trees (Rodriguezomez et al. 2015 ). Readers can refer to Nelson et al. ( 2015 ) for the ata release of Illustris-1 simulation. More details of the simulation an be found in Vogelsberger et al. ( 2014a , 2014b ), Genel et al. 2014 ), and Sijacki et al. ( 2015 ).\n.3 TNG100-1\nhe TNG100-1 simulation is a cosmological, large-scale gravity magnetohydrodynamical simulation with the moving mesh code REPO (Springel 2010 ). Its cosmological parameters are consistent ith Planck2015 (Planck Collaboration et al. 2016 ), i.e. = .6911, m = 0.3089, b = 0.0486, \u03c3 8 = 0.8159, n s = 0.9667, nd h = 0.6774. Its box size is 110.7 3 Mpc 3 . The simulation contains 820 3 dark matter particles and 1820 3 initial hydrodynamic cells. The ass resolution of dark matter particles is 7.5 \u00d7 10 6 M and the initial ass resolution of baryons is 1.4 \u00d7 10 6 M . The simulation evolves he initial condition from redshift 127\u20130 with 100 output snapshots. ompared with Illustris-1, the TNG100-1 simulation includes an pdated physical model to simulate the formation and evolution f galaxies (see Pillepich et al. 2018a ). The TNG model updates he recipes for star formation and evolution, chemical enrichment, ooling, and feedback (Weinberger et al. 2017 ; Nelson et al. 2018 ; illepich et al. 2018b ). It also presents a revised AGN feedback model o control the massive galaxies (Weinberger et al. 2017 ) and galactic inds model to shape the low-mass galaxies (Pillepich et al. 2018b ). eaders can refer to Nelson et al. ( 2019 ) for the data release of NG100-1 simulation. More details can be found in the introductory aper series of TNG100-1(Pillepich et al. 2018b ; Springel et al. 2018 ; elson et al. 2019 ; Naiman et al. 2018 ; Marinacci et al. 2018 ).\n.4 Galaxy Samples\nhe SUBFIND (Springel, Yoshida & White 2001 ) algorithm is used o locate the substructures. Within a subhalo, all gases, stars, and ark matter particles (or cells) are associated with a single galaxy. he galaxy\u2019s stellar mass ( M \u2217) is defined as the sum of the masses f all stellar particles contained inside a single substructure. The SFH of 243 810 galaxies with M \u2217( z = 0) > 10 9 M h \u22121 s extracted from the galaxy catalogue in THETHREEHUNDRED . he largest galaxy has a stellar mass of 10 13.4 M h \u20131 . There are a ew super large galaxies in this sample, which are in fact central CG + ICL. Their number is quite small, and thus they do not have oo much influence on building up the models. Therefore, we do not ry to separate the ICL for them. There are a few super large galaxies n this sample, which are in fact central brightest cluster Galaxies BCG) plus intra-cluster light (ICL). Their number is quite small, o they do not have too much influence on building up the models.\nherefore, we do not try to separate the ICL for them. Readers can efer to Cui et al. ( 2022 ) for more details. To a v oid contamination t the periphery of re-simulations, the selected galaxies are confined o a distance of 15Mpc from the host cluster\u2019s centre at z = 0.\nAt redshift 0, the final Illustris-1 catalogue has 4 366 546 subtructures. Among these, we selected the SFH of 21 795 galaxies ith M \u2217( z = 0) > 10 8 M h \u22121 for our analysis. The largest galaxy as a stellar mass of 10 12.0 M h \u22121 .\nAt redshift 0, the final TNG100-1 catalogue has 4 371 211 subtructures. Among these, we selected the SFH of 28 388 galaxies ith M \u2217( z = 0) > 10 8 M h \u22121 for our analysis. The largest galaxy as a stellar mass of 10 12.1 M h \u22121 .\n.5 The SFR of Simulated Galaxies\nn simulations, each gas cell/particle has its own star formation ate (SFR) to guide its star formation process in the subsequent hase. A galaxy SFR is computed by adding the SFR of all its as cells/particles. From an observational point of view, this is an nstantaneous star formation rate, which is not measurable in practice. herefore numerous studies derive the SFR estimates from the stellar ass formed o v er the last N Myr (Donnari et al. 2019 ; Hahn et l. 2019 ). In these approaches, the SFR measurement is strongly ependent on the choice of the time-scale, N . Since in our work we ocus e xclusiv ely on the SFH from the three reference simulations, in he following we will use the instantaneous SFR to minimize the unertainties introduced by the time-scale of SFR estimates. This is also ore appropriate for our analysis, where we want to model the impact f stochastic events that can produce sudden variations of the SFR. Due to the time resolution limitation of snapshots, we must elinquish fluctuation information with a time-scale shorter than he interval between snapshots (about \u03b4t = 0.135 Gyr). Principally, ur work is using the instantaneous SFR to represent the average FR in the following \u03b4t . Because the time-scale of instantaneous FR is shorter than \u03b4t , this will introduce bias to fluctuation at this ime-scale. Ho we ver, other methods to e v aluate the SFR within a ime-scale cannot a v oid contamination from mergers and the death f stars (e.g. Matthee & Schaye 2019 ). There is not a perfect method o probe into the SFR v ariance do wn to a very short time-scale. eaders should keep in mind that the variations around a time-scale f 0.135 Gyr or shorter are not accurate in this work. Notably, many simulated galaxies might have their instantaneous FR of 0 at some time. For brevity, we will refer to this as the 0SFR\u2019 stage. Galaxies at \u20180SFR\u2019 stage typically lack cold gas or ontain just hot gas cells/particles. These \u20180SFR\u2019 galaxies are more ikely the result of a resolution effect. At that time, galaxies may have small volume of gas that cannot be resolved, or a relatively low FR value, yet are numerically recognized as having zero SFR. In the FH of a simulated galaxy, a \u20180SFR\u2019 stage will show up as a sudden -peak, followed by a jump to a non-zero SFR. This is a condition hat is unlikely to occur in real galaxies. Additionally, \u20180SFR\u2019 stage an appear in a prolonged quenched phase that sometimes continues ntil redshift z = 0. To a v oid biased estimates from spurious events nd \u2212\u221e values in log SFR, we will either reset the value of \u20180SFR\u2019 ata points or omit them from our inferences, depending on our bjectives. We will specify which of these options we take in the ollowing, when necessary.\nFinally, for the sake of brevity, we will adopt the following efinitions throughout the rest of the paper:\n\u2261 log ( M \u2217/ (h \u22121 M )) (1)\n\u2261 log ( SF R/ ( M yr \u22121 )) .

We assume that these two components are unrelated n order to model them independently, as we detail in the following wo subsections.\n.1 Modelling the Main Sequence Part of SFH\n.1.1 Mesuring the main sequence SFR\nhe first part of our model can be derived from the analytical function or the main sequence star formation rate ( m , z) \u2261 log SFR ( m , ). Many observations indicate a strong correlation between the tellar mass and SFR of star-forming galaxies, dubbed the \u2018main equence\u2019 (e.g Noeske et al. 2007 ; Wuyts et al. 2011 ; Whitaker t al. 2012 ; Schreiber et al. 2015 ). Such a correlation is also eco v ered in simulations, as illustrated in Fig. 2 . Ho we ver, the precise ormula describing this relation depends on the sample selection and easuring method (see Pillepich et al. 2018b ; Donnari et al. 2019 ; isigello et al. 2018 , for reference). Here below, we describe the rocedure adopted to quantify the main sequence in this paper. We found that galaxies within a stellar mass bin [ m \u2212 m /2, m + m /2] have their ln SFR generally follow a normal distribution.\n( ln SF R) \u223c N ( \u03bc, \u03c3 2 ) = 1 \u03c3 \u221a 2 \u03c0 e \u2212 ( ln SFR\u2212\u03bc) 2 2 \u03c32 . (4)\nhe mass bin m is chosen to have a width of 0.3 dex in THETHREEUNDRED and 0.4 dex in Illustris-1 and TNG100-1. We can locate\nhe peak of the SFR distribution at SFR peak ( m ) = e \u03bc( m ) in each mass in about m by fitting the normal distribution to the lnSFR histogram. nly 0 SFR galaxies are excluded from the samples in this procedure. he mean and scatter of SFR distribution, \u03bc and \u03c3 , vary with the tellar mass and the redshift. The \u03bc has a linear relationship with m\nlog M \u2217, while the \u03c3 is found to be approximately between 0.2 and .5 de x.

After fitting with\nquation ( 5 ), we obtained the main sequence SFR function MS ( m ,\n), which is a function of stellar mass and redshifts. In practice, as llustrated in Fig. 2 , our fitting to the MS omits the data points with arge scatters at low mass or high mass end.\nThe resulted main sequence exhibits distinct slopes at low-mass nd high-mass regions. This is evident in the THETHREEHUNDRED imulation. MS appears to have a consistent at z = 0 in Illustris-1 nd TNG100-1. Ho we ver, at higher redshifts, their MSs also have istinct slopes for low and high masses. Fig. A1 shows the SFR \u2212 M \u2217 istribution at higher redshifts. From this figure, we can deduce that S is bending. To extract a universal function of main sequence SFR, e adopt piecewise linear function. For the MS in the THETHREEUNDRED simulation, we adopt a three-fold linear function,\nMS = \u23a7 \u23aa \u23a8 \u23aa \u23a9 k 1 ( m \u2212 m 1 ) + 1 m \u2264 m 1 1 \u2212 2 m 1 \u2212m 2 ( m \u2212 m 2 ) + 2 m 1 \u2264 m < m 2 k 2 ( m \u2212 m 2 ) + 2 m \u2265 m 2 .\n(6)\nor the MS in the Illustris-1 and TNG100-1 simulations, we adopt two-fold linear function as follows:\nMS = {\nk 1 ( m \u2212 m 1 ) + 1 m < m 1 k 2 ( m \u2212 m 1 ) + 1 m \u2265 m 1 .

To facilitate modelling, we ubstitute the universal lookback time t L for the redshift z. And in all he following context, we will use t L by default. We plot the 1 \u2212 1 m 1 as a function of t L in these figures rather than the 1 , because he former one represents the intercept in equations ( 6 ) and ( 7 ).\nThe best-fitting values for these parameters are indicated by orange ashed lines in the same figures, and for completeness, the final forms f fitting functions are shown below.

To illustrate ow the MSs vary, in Fig. 6 , we compare the MSs at redshifts , 0.5, 1, and 2 for the three simulations.

According to Figs 3 \u20135 and Table 1 , he MS in each simulation has distinct slopes and intercepts. The slope of MS ( k 1 or k 2 ) denotes how many more stars form hen the galaxy stellar mass is increased. It can be related to the pecific star formation rate ( SFR / M \u2217). A slope corresponding to k = indicates that the specific star formation rate is independent of the tellar mass. For k > 1, the specific star formation rate increases ith stellar mass, implying that massive galaxies form stars more fficiently . On the contrary , for k < 1 the specific star formation rate\nNRAS 515, 3249\u20133269 (2022)\nTable 1. A summary of the MS\u2019s parameters.

In THETHREEHUNDRED , both the slopes of the high mass S ( k 2 ) and the low mass MS ( k 1 ) decline slightly as t L increases. n Illustris-1 and TNG100-1, the high mass slopes decrease as t L ncreases, whereas the low mass slopes increase as t L increases. In HETHREEHUNDRED , the time dependency of slopes is considerably ore obvious. The high mass slopes in Illustris-1 and TNG100-1 ppear to be nearly constant. The intercept of MS ( 1 \u2212 k 1 m 1 , 1 \u2212 k 2 m 1 , or 1 \u2212 k 2 m 2 ) differs n three simulations. In THETHREEHUNDRED , the intercepts of both ow and high mass MS increase as t L increases in a similar slope, lbeit the latter one is approximately 5.7 dex smaller. In Illustrisand TNG100-1, the intercepts of higher mass MS increase as t L ncreases, whereas the intercepts of low mass MS slightly decrease ith t L . At an early epoch (about t L > 8.5 Gyr), all simulations xhibit abrupt decreases or increases in intercepts. We use a linear t to describe the evolution of intercepts that omits this part. Such a inearly time-dependent intercept was also adopted in Speagle et al. 2014 ) and Iyer et al. ( 2018 ). This form seems to contradict previous iterature claiming that the MS intercept grows with redshifts as (1 z) 2.2 (Brinchmann et al. 2004 ; Daddi et al. 2007 ; Elbaz et al. 007 ; Noesk e et al. 2007 ; Whitak er et al. 2012 ; Schreiber et al. 015 ). In Figs 3 \u20135 , we represent this trend of (1 + z) 2.2 as green ashed lines (converting z to t L ). Only the massive end of the MS in HETHREEHUNDRED has a comparable pattern. Ho we v er, be a ware hat the intercepts in Speagle et al. ( 2014 ), Iyer et al. ( 2018 ), and his work are the intercepts located at logM \u2217 = 0, while in some ther works they tend to use the intercept at logM \u2217 = 9 \u223c 10. The ifference between intercepts at different logM \u2217 depends on the slope f MS, which is time dependent. It\u2019s not fair to compare intercepts t different stellar masses.\nThe MS of THETHREEHUNDRED appears considerably different rom those two Illustris runs. It should be mentioned, ho we ver, that he low mass MS in THETHREEHUNDRED is roughly in the same mass ange as the high mass MS in Illustris-1 and TNG100-1 (see Fig. 6 ).\nhen the low mass MS in THETHREEHUNDRED is compared to the igh mass MS in Illustris-1 and TNG100-1, it appears to be more onsistent. While the THETHREEHUNDRED galaxies are mainly in lusters, the Illustris-1 and TNG100-1 galaxies live in various kinds f environments. One may argue that this is an explanation for the MS isparity between simulations. Ho we ver, some prior studies assert hat the underlying physics go v erning MS evolution are relatively nsensitive to the environments (Peng et al. 2010 ; Koyama et al. 2013 ; in et al. 2014 ). Therefore, we considered the difference between HETHREEHUNDRED and Illustris runs to be mostly due to their subrid physics recipes, rather than the effect from environments. The difference of MS across different mass ranges should mainly e attributed to the varied sub-grid physics at different masses. Many emi-analytical models have demonstrated that the intercept of MS s significantly connected with the gas inflow and outflow rates with alo mass (e.g. Guo & White 2008 ; Dave, Finlator & Oppenheimer 011 ; Dav \u0301e et al. 2012 ). Sparre et al. ( 2015 ) asserts that this holds rue for simulations as well. Although the gas flow in simulations annot be directly controlled, the strength of feedbacks and cooling ate can have an effect. The explicit division of MS into two mass alves reflects the fact that these simulations adopt quite different eedback models in different mass range in order to match the tellar mass function in all mass ranges. Although the resolution ffect is another possible reason, the values of MS turning point inimize this probability. Illustris-1 and TNG100-1 have a very lose resolution. Ho we ver, the knee point in TNG100-1 is about dex larger than that in Illustris-1. They should be comparable if the\nesolution effect dominates the difference in MS slopes. On the other and, no simulation maintains constant values for turning points. f the difference in MS between mass ranges is purely a resolution ffect, we would anticipate turning points to be independent of time, s resolution does not change o v er time in a single simulation. The emporal dependence of turning points, m 1 and m 2 , is best fitted by a ower function in THETHREEHUNDRED . In Illustris-1 and TNG100, their m 1 initially increases and subsequently decreases. Concerning he uncertainty at the early epoch, we fit m 1 at t L < 10 Gyr using a inear function (top left-hand panel in Figs 4 and 5 ).\n.1.3 Uncertainties in MS measurement\nonnari et al. ( 2019 ) demonstrates that some factors will affect he MS measured. When comparing theoretical models with obervations, as well as between observational data themselves, the ncertainties brought by measurements must be carefully examined. When researchers compare the MS from observations to that from imulations, they typically use an average SFR over a certain timecale, such as 10, 50, 100, or 1000 Myr (Donnari et al. 2019 ; Iyer et al. 020 ). Although the simulations provide the galaxy\u2019s instantaneous FR, it cannot be observed in observ ations. Ho we ver, the v arying ime-scales can result in different MS(see appendix A in Donnari t al. 2019 ). Because the goal of our work is to find the pattern of SFHs n simulations rather than to compare them to observations, we emloy the instantaneous SFR to focus on the more intrinsic variables. imilarly, we determine the SFR and stellar mass of all particles ound to a subhalo rather than taking a specific aperture, e.g. 30 kpc. The MS may also be affected by sample selection due to its efinition. Usually, the median or mean log SFR of a certain range f star-forming galaxies is defined as the MS ( M \u2217). The cut for ample selection results in inconsistency in the star-forming main equence across various works (Somerville & Dav \u0301e 2015 ). To avoid he uncertainty from selection effect, some works employ more omplex approaches to define the MS. Renzini & Peng ( 2015 ) resented an objective definition for the MS, defining it as the ridge ine that connects the peaks on the SFR \u2212 M \u2217 contour. Bisigello et al. 2018 ) used a multiple-Gaussian function to decompose the SFR \u2212 \u2217 distribution into three sequences: starburst, main sequence, and uenched galaxies. Hahn et al. ( 2019 ) identified the MS using a e xible data-driv en approach termed Gaussian mixture modelling. ll of these methods consider all galaxies while determining the MS, ithout making any selection from galaxy samples. Our method is airly similar to theirs. We begin by identifying the ridge line using a ingle Gaussian function and then fitting it with a linear function to btain the MS. As with previous works, this method is less affected y the sample\u2019s range. Therefore, we use all galaxies, except those ith SFR = 0, to define the MS.\n.1.4 A summary of the MS part\nhe MS part of the SFH can be modelled using the fitting formula or the main sequence of the \u2212 m distribution. For instance, we an build the evolution of main sequence by combining equations ( 6 ) nd ( 7 ) with equations ( 8 )\u2013( 10 ), to obtain\nMS ( t L , m ) = k( t L ) m ( t L ) + 0 ( t L ) (11) ( t L ) and 0 ( t L ) can be obtained from Table 1 .\nOne might construct a stellar mass growth history for galaxies s well as the SFR history, assuming that galaxies evolve exactly ollowing the modelled MS. In principle, if the growth of a galaxy\u2019s tellar mass can be represented as a function of time, the SFR history\nMNRAS 515, 3249\u20133269 (2022)\nM\no t f\nE t h t t S\n3\n3\nA h a q S\nA 2 f B f m k H s B f f a e\ni w\nw s m 0\nB t p t a p a I d\n2\nS s c t o f f l\nm m A \u03c3\n\u03c3 b s g\nt f S m h f p\na\ne t a s w s \u03c4 ( S \u03c4 a t\nb t\n\u03c7\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/515/3/3249/6643333 by U niversity of W estern Australia user on 31 August 2022\nMS ( t L ) can be modelled via equation ( 11 ). For an in situ growth f stellar mass, the m ( t L ) is an integration to ( t L ). By applying the ime-dependent regression of slope k and intercept 0 to the function or in situ mass growth, we can obtain the following result:\nd M \u2217( t L ) d t L = \u221210 0 M k \u2217 . (12)\nquation ( 12 ) describes an SFH model with mass growth following he MS without any perturbation. We refer to it as the \u2019MS model\u2019 ereafter. Solving equation ( 12 ) is difficult. We give a short descripion of the analytical solution to it in Appendix C . In practice, we ry to solve it in a numerical way. We will discuss its performance in ection 3.3 .\n.2 Modelling the SFH variation\n.2.1 Modelling method and result\npart from the evolution along the main sequence, our model as to reproduce the observed scatter in the M \u2217\u2013SFR diagram, by ccounting for the variation in the SFH of individual galaxies. We uantify the variation as an offset of a galaxy\u2019s position in the M \u2217\u2013 FR diagram relative to the main sequence:\n( t L ) = gal ( t L ) \u2212 MS ( t L , m ( t L )) . (13) These offsets are quite likely to occur in a stochastic process.\nccording to previous studies (Kelson 2014 ; Caplar & Tacchella 019 ), fractional Brownian motion (fBm) can describe the pattern ollowed by individual galaxies. For a standard Brownian motion ( t ), the increments B ( t ) \u2212 B ( s ) are stationary and independent and ollow the normal distribution N (0 , \u03c3 2 | t \u2212 s| ). Fractional Brownian otion is a Brownian motion with increments weighted by the ernel ( t \u2212 s ) H \u2212 1/2 (Mandelbrot & van Ness 1968 ). The parameter , satisfying 0 < H < 1, shows the self-similarity property of a tochastic process. When H = 0.5, the fBm becomes a standard rownian motion. When H < 0.5, a given step is more likely to be ollowed by a reversed step; that is, if B H ( t + 1) \u2212 B H ( t ) is deviates rom the mean, the subsequent step B H ( t + 2) \u2212 B H ( t + 1) will ttempt to revert to the mean. When H > 0.5, the stochastic process xhibits a long-term trend.\nWe proposed a model based on a stationary fBm with a small nclination. This model is applied to the simulation data to find out hether it is true. The model is described by the following equation:\n( t L ) = \u03b1t L + \u03b2 + A \u00d7 B H ( t L ) , A \u223c N ( \u03bcA , \u03c3A ) , (14) here \u03b1t L + \u03b2 part describes the o v erall trend of , \u03b1 is the average\nlope, and \u03b2 is the average intercept. With this item, our model can atch the ( t L ) regardless of whether this process is stationary ( \u03b1 = ) or non-stationary ( \u03b1 = 0). The latter part of the equation, A \u00d7 B H ( t L ), is scaled fractional rownian motion. The fBm B H ( t L ) is generated in PYTHON using he FBM module. 2 To begin, we build an fBm series with Np = 400 oints for each realization. It will produce a series B H subject to he constraint B H ( m ) \u2212 B H ( n ) \u223c N (0 , ( | m \u2212n | 400 ) 2 H ), where m and n re integers between 0 and 400, respectively, and H is the Hurst arameter. We then select the points from index 200 to 200 + [ T / \u03b4t ] s the series we want. The start point is arbitrarily chosen to 200. n this case, the initial fluctuation in modelled SFH is a normal istribution rather than 0. T denotes the o v erall duration of a galaxy\u2019s\nNRAS 515, 3249\u20133269 (2022)\nht tps://pypi.org/project /fbm/ 3\nFH in unit of Gyr. \u03b4t is the time interval. We set \u03b4t to be 0.135 Gyr, o that the number of data points of our modelled variation history is lose to that of SFHs with the same age from simulations. Be aware hat the time interval does not affect the majority of the properties f fBm series. For example, when the H parameter is the same, the Bm series with Np points, and \u03b4t time interval is equivalent to the Bm series with 2 Np and 0.5 \u03b4t at a time-scales of \u03c4 > \u03b4t , while the atter offers additional information at time-scales of 0.5 \u03b4t < \u03c4 < \u03b4t .\nGiven that the variation history ( t ) of each individual galaxy ay have a different amplitude, we rescale the fractional Brownian otion for each individual galaxy history using a random number . A has a normal distribution with a mean of \u03bcA and a variance of A . \u03bcA and \u03c3 A are free parameters. In summary, this model comprises five free parameters: \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03bcA ,\nA , and H . We generate the best-fitting models for each simulation y tweaking these parameters. In practice, we create modelled time eries model ( t L ), i.e. the variation of SFH, for each individual alaxies using a set of \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03bcA , \u03c3 A , and H . The number of model ( t L ) series is the same as the number of sampled SFHs from heir corresponding simulations. The length (age) of model ( t L ) also ollows the same distribution of length of corresponding simulated FHs. We first apply an initial estimation of free parameters to the odel, and then derive some statistics of the modelled variation istories. The same statistics are also applied to variation histories rom simulations. By comparing those statistics, we tweak the free arameters. We make use of the statistics of the following features:\n(i) the distribution of average variation ; (ii) the distribution of root square mean variation 2 ; (iii) the distribution of starburst time t b ; (iv) the distribution of starburst duration \u03c4 b ; (v) the distribution of quenching time t q ; (vi) the distribution of quenched duration \u03c4 b .\nThe former two features, and 2 , qualify the amplitudes of ( t L ). The \u20180SFR\u2019 points introduce a large bias in averaging the mplitudes, and are thus excluded from the SFHs when calculating and 2 . The latter four features, \u03c4 b , \u03c4 q , t b , and t q , are related to the starburst vents and quenching processes of the SFH. In this work, we define he galaxies located abo v e 2 \u03c3 3 from the main sequence as being in \u2018starburst stage\u2019, and galaxies located below 2 \u03c3 from the main equence as being in a \u2018quenched stage\u2019. t b (or t q ) is the time point hen a galaxy enters the starburst (or quenched) stage. Multiple tarburst or quenching times can exist within a single SFH. \u03c4 b (or q ) is the cumulative amount of time a galaxy spends in the starburst or quenched) stage. These four features pertain solely to the timing in FHs. \u20180SFR\u2019 data points are not remo v ed when calculating the t q and q . Because, while their SFR values are imprecise, their timing values re regarded to be correct and physically meaningful in characterizing he variation histories.\nWe generate and compare the distributions of each feature using oth models and simulations. To calibrate the comparison, we utilize he sum of mean squared differences,\n2 = ( P ( model ) \u2212 P ( sim )) 2 + ( P ( 2 model ) \u2212 P ( 2 sim )) 2 + ( P ( t b , model ) \u2212 P ( t b , sim )) 2 + ( P ( t q , model ) \u2212 P ( t q , sim )) 2 + ( P ( \u03c4b , model ) \u2212 P ( \u03c4b , sim )) 2 + ( P ( \u03c4q , model ) \u2212 P ( \u03c4q , sim )) 2 .

Fig. 7 llustrates the process mentioned abo v e graphically. Due to the ranom nature of the process used to generate histories, the best-fitting arameters are not exactly the same in each time of fitting. Therefore, e perform fitting 50 times and get the mean and variance of the tting parameters. The best-fitting parameters are listed in Table 2 . Each of the three models has a positive average slope \u03b1 and a e gativ e av erage intercept \u03b2. This suggests that, on av erage, the rajectories of SFHs in these simulations tend to travel from abo v e he main sequence to below the main sequence, which is in agreement ith earlier findings (see Iyer et al. 2020 ; Matthee & Schaye 2019 ). he average slopes of Illustris-1 and TNG100-1 are greater than hose of THETHREEHUNDRED . This implies that, on average, the FHs in THETHREEHUNDRED are more likely to be parallel to the ain sequence. The parameters concerning the amplitudes of variations, \u03bcA and A , are relatively similar in three simulations. Only in THETHREEUNDRED is the \u03bcA slightly larger than in Illustris-1 and TNG100-1, eflecting a more varied SFH there. The H parameter in three simulations is much smaller than 0.5.\nhis implies that the variations tend to converge around 0. In other ords, the SFHs in simulations tend to follow the main sequence. he H parameter in THETHREEHUNDRED (0.20) is significantly larger\nhan those in Illustris-1 (0.052) and TNG100-1 (0.070). This indicates hat the trends toward returning to the main sequence are significantly tronger in Illustris-1 and TNG100-1. Readers may note that Kelson 2014 ) proposed a Hurst parameter of 0.9 for his SFH model, which ooks quite different from our models. We emphasize that the small alue of H here is solely for the variation history. In Kelson ( 2014 ),\ne chose the value of H for SFHs, i.e. the MS part + variation art in this work. The entire SFH exhibits very significant longerm trends, which results in a larger H . We can also obtain a value f H \u223c 0.7 by measuring the Hurst parameters of SFHs in three imulations. It is difficult to tell which value is closer to the truth, ince both simulations and theories in Kelson ( 2014 ) are capable f reproducing realistic galaxy populations. The discussion of this istinction requires additional investigation, which is beyond the urpose of this work. Fig. 8 gives an o v ervie w of ho w well the variation histories in he models converge with those in simulations. The samples are eparated into different bins according to their stellar mass at z = 0. n each stellar mass bin, we randomly select 100 variation histories rom simulations and another 100 from corresponding models. These ariation histories are plotted together in each subpanel of Fig. 8 for omparison. Note that our current models are independent of the tellar mass. Without considering the \u20180SFR\u2019 points, the modelled ariation histories are well in agreement with those from simulations.\nHo we ver, the v ariation histories in simulations sho w some appreiable dependence on the stellar mass. For galaxies with a stellar ass more than 10 12 M h \u22121 and between 10 10 and 10 11 M h \u22121 in HETHREEHUNDRED , their variation histories are more concentrated o 0, which makes them less similar to the model. In Illustrisand TNG100-1, the simulated and modelled variation histories how a higher degree of agreement and merely no mass dependency. ariation histories of galaxies abo v e 10 11 M h \u22121 in Illustris-1 have hallower slopes of o v erall trends, which is different from the model. s illustrated in Fig. 8 , the models capture the variations within dex. When a galaxy\u2019s SFR falls below 1 dex below MS, e.g. when t enters a quenching stage, the random walk model can no longer redict its trajectory.\n.2.2 The goodness of modelling\ns mentioned abo v e, we use the distributions of six parameters to onstrain our variation history models. Prior evaluating our model\u2019s erformance, we have to demonstrate how well these parameters re matched. Fig. 9 shows the distributions of six parameters orresponding to our best-fitting models for three simulations.\nIn particular, the top two rows of Fig. 9 show that the distributions f and 2 in our models are closely matched with simulations. he primary divergence is the presence of tails at ne gativ e end in the istribution of from simulations (especially THETHREEHUNDRED nd TNG100-1), which cannot be reproduced by our models. Indeed, he Brownian motion patterns yield a normal distribution of by efinition. The existence of quenched stage in simulations that cannot e replicated using Brownian motion should take responsibility to his tail. On the other hand, the distributions of 2 of modelled istories nicely reproduce the distributions from simulations with ather good accuracy.\nThe histograms of t b , t q , \u03c4 b , and \u03c4 q are shown in the third to sixth ows of Fig. 9 . The t b distributions from all simulations (orange lines) eak at larger lookback times, indicating that starburst occurs at early pochs, whereas the t q distributions peak at lower lookback times, ndicating that quenching occurs at late epochs. In the majority of ases, our model accurately captures these characteristics, with some arger deviations for THETHREEHUNDRED . In the left two columns, e plot the duration of the starburst and quenched stages with respect o the total lifetime of galaxies. As we see, all distributions peak at uite low ratios ( \u223c0.1), meaning that both starburst and quenched hases last for less than 10 per cent of the galaxy\u2019s lifetime.

In particular, they predict slightly longer tarburst phases. Once again, the largest discrepancies from our odel predictions are found for the THETHREEHUNDRED simulation, hich may warrant further discussions. The THETHREEHUNDRED simulation shows that there is an excess f longer quenched phases ( \u03c4 q / \u03c4 total > 0.5 Gyr, see second column). e remark that this could be the cause of the discrepancies found in he MS scatter discussed abo v e in histograms of and 2 . The FHs with long durations of quenched stages populate the very e gativ e part of the distribution. One possibility to reco v er this ehaviour would be patch extra quenching process into our Brownian otion model. Ho we ver, this w ould lik ely require some fine tuning\nhat is beyond the scope of this paper and will be addressed in orthcoming works. Hence, we did not attempt to reproduce the \u03c4 q in HETHREEHUNDRED , as our models were still capable of accurately epresenting the distribution of t b , t q , \u03c4 b , and \u03c4 q in all simulations.\n.2.3 The position relative to the MS\nhe first test on our model follows the approach presented in atthee & Schaye ( 2019 ). The y e xamine the trend of median fluctua-\nions of SFR by selecting sub-sets of galaxies that are abo v e the main equence at z = 0.1 and measuring the fraction of these galaxies that emain abo v e the main sequence at other cosmic times. They show (in\nMNRAS 515, 3249\u20133269 (2022)\nM\nFigure 10. The fraction of galaxies located abo v e and below the main sequence in reference to the galaxy sample at z = 0.

Based on this evidence, they assert that current galaxy FRs retain a memory of the past star formation history. We select subgroups of galaxies abo v e (or below) the MS at z = 0 nd trace their progenitors to find out what fraction of them remains bo v e (or below) the MS line. Our results are shown in Fig. 10 . e calculate both the evolution of the fraction of galaxies abo v e solid lines) and below (dashed lines) the main sequence. The data rom Matthee & Schaye ( 2019 ) are added to Fig. 10 as red lines for eference. Additionally, the results from a variation history model onstructed using white noise (i.e. random fluctuation) are shown in his figure as green line. White noise means that the fluctuation has o memories of its former existence. So, their fractions of galaxies bo v e or below the MS remain constant of 50 per cent at all other imes except the time as reference. The fractions drop to 0 at earlier ime because the lifetime of SFHs is not infinity. Tracing on their rogenitors will come to a stop at some time, resulting in the demise f fraction. Because the SFHs in THETHREEHUNDRED have a shorter ifetime than the other two, we observe that their curv es be gin to ecline at lower t L . From t L = 0 to earlier epochs, the fraction of galaxies below the MS ecreases rapidly, while the fraction of galaxies abo v e the MS has a harp decline followed by a mild bend. Our model can well reproduce he curves for the fraction of galaxies below the MS, but there are bvious inconsistencies for the fraction above the MS. In our models, galaxy located abo v e the MS is more likely to maintain its position ompared to simulations. There are two possible explanations. If ome galaxies abo v e the MS hav e already e xperienced quenched tages at earlier time, the fraction of galaxies abo v e MS will drop ore quickly. On the other hand, if the variation histories contain a arge proportion of noisy-like fluctuations, as indicated by the green ines, the fractions will drop to 0.5 quickly. We hypothesize that while here are more galaxies in the quenched stages (including \u20180SFR\u2019 oints) in THETHREEHUNDRED , the noisy-like fluctuation appears to e more prominent in Illustris-1 and TNG100-1. This assumption ill be pro v ed by other outcomes in the following sections. The curve in Matthee & Schaye ( 2019 ) is different from the curves n the simulations we examine. We confirm that this distinction is ue to the incline of the stochastic process. Our variation history\nNRAS 515, 3249\u20133269 (2022)\ns specified as non-stationary stochastic process with an inclination t L + \u03b2 (see equation ( 14 )). When \u03b1 = 0 and \u03b2 = 0, the fractions bo v e and below the MS behave identically to the curve described in atthee & Schaye ( 2019 ).\n.2.4 PSD of variation history\nhe power spectrum density (PSD) enables us to quantify the mportance of different frequencies in any time series.\nFig. 11 compares the PSDs of ( t L ) obtained from simulations o those derived from our models. We randomly select 50 variation istories from simulations and 50 modelled variation histories, and lot their PSDs together in each panel. The figure shows that the SDs of our modelled variation histories closely match variation istories from simulations. Principally, The PSD of a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst arameter H is\nSD = {\nf \u2212(2 H+ 1) 0 < H \u2264 0 . 5 f \u22122 0 . 5 < H < 1\n(16)\nsee Mandelbrot & van Ness 1968 ; Majumdar & Oshanin 2018 ). part from fractional Brownian motion, our variation history model ncludes a linear change term \u03b1t L + \u03b2, which strengthens the ong-term component of PSD and hence makes the PSD steeper. hus, our models have PSDs with slopes of < \u22121.4 for THETHREEUNDRED , < \u22121.10 for Illustris-1, and < \u22121.14 for TNG100-1, espectiv ely. The av erage PSDs showed in Fig. 11 are consistent with heory.\nIt is worth noting that the PSDs of variation histories in Illustris-1 nd TNG100-1 also exhibit a secondary branch, in which the PSDs re nearly constant o v er all time-scales, i.e. PSD \u221d f 0 . Because white oise typically has a PSD \u221d f 0 , this part is referred to as white noise ode . The white noise mode in Illustris-1 and TNG100-1 is the eason for the shallower average PSDs than those in our models. Most theoretical works on the PSDs of SFHs fa v our a slope of \u22122 Iyer et al. 2020 ; Tacchella et al. 2020 ; ), which is steeper than the lopes observed in simulations and in our models. We need to clarify hat the PSDs of variations history discussed in this subsection are hallower than PSDs of SFHs, because the latter has extra longerm evolutions than the former, adding more power to the low\nFigure 11. The power spectrum density of ( t L ). PSDs of variation histories of 50 randomly chosen galaxies from simulations are shown in orange lines. 50 PSDs of corresponding modelled variation histories are plotted in blue lines. From left-hand to right-hand panels, the results are for data from the THETHREEHUNDRED , Illustris-1, and TNG100-1 simulations, respectively. The mean of 50 PSDs of models or simulations is plotted with green or red thick lines.

The average slopes of PSDs of SFHs are pproximately \u22122 for THETHREEHUNDRED but are still shallower or Illustris-1 and TNG100-1 at \u22121.5. The existence of variation istories with white noise mode in Illustris-1 and TNG100-1 may xplain why the slopes are shallower, as we will discuss in more etail in subsequent sections. The white noise mode can also explain the o v erprediction to the ractions of progenitors abo v e MS, which is discussed in Section .2.3 . Tacchella et al. ( 2020 ) suggests an analytical SFH model with a roken power-law PSD, SD ( f ) = C ( \u03c4x f ) \u03b2l + ( \u03c4x f ) \u03b2h . (17) ccording to their model, the total PSD is contributed mainly by he inflow process, the regulation of gas flow, and the star formation rocess related to the GMCs. Different physical processes have PSDs ith different break time-scale \u03c4 x and slope \u03b2h and \u03b2 l . This should stablish a connection between the slopes and break time-scales f PSDs and the physics of SFHs. Thus, the white noise mode in llustris-1 and TNG100-1 may imply a distinct sub-physics process, hich is different from that in THETHREEHUNDRED . One thing for sure is that those variation histories in white noise ode are unaffected by the long-term perturbations caused by host aloes or mergers. Ho we ver, due to the temporal resolution of SFHs, e are unable to identify fluctuations caused by processes with timecales smaller than \u223c1 Gyr. This suggests that these galaxies may be riven by the inner baryonic mechanisms such as stellar feedback, alactic wind, photoionization feedback or SNe (see Iyer et al. 2020 ). .2.5 ACF of variation history ig. 12 shows the test for convergence of the auto-correlation function ACF) between models and simulations. For one time series ( t ), he ACF is defined as\nCF ( \u03b4t) = Cov ( ( t) , ( t + \u03b4t)) \u03c3 ( t) \u03c3 ( t + \u03b4t ) . (18)\nt illustrates the relationship between data and their preceding points t \u03b4t time intervals. It is the Fourier transform of PSD. The ACF nables us to quantify the self-similarity of the signal o v er different ime-scales. A highly self-correlated series leads to ACF \u223c 1, hereas an uncorrelated time series leads to ACF \u223c 0 and anticor-\nelation with ACF \u223c \u22121. Hence, we can assess whether a galaxy\u2019s FR is correlated to its precursor\u2019s SFR at certain time-scales. Fig. 12 shows the ACF of variation histories ( t L ) obtained in hree simulations (top row) and their counterparts in our models bottom row). In the THETHREEHUNDRED simulation, the ACF is lose to 1 when the time delay \u03b4t is about 0.2 Gyr. This suggests that he SFHs retain their former state for a period 0.2 Gyr . In TNG100-1 nd Illustris-1, the ACF at this time-scale is much weaker than that f THETHREEHUNDRED . Especially in Illustris-1, the ACF(0.2 Gyr) oncentrates on the value < 0.5, implying that the variation histories n Illustris-1 are most likely uncorrelated at this time-scale. This is n consistent with the claim made by Caplar & Tacchella ( 2019 ) hat \u03c4 break is around 200 Myr. As suggested by Caplar & Tacchella 2019 ), the time-scale of 200 Myr is more likely to be associated ith the baryonic effect. The ACF finally drops down to 0 when t increases to 2 Gyr, which is close to the dynamical time of dark atter haloes. Therefore, the baryonic effects play a more important ole in shaping the SFH. Moreo v er, it is possible that some baryonic ffects in THETHREEHUNDRED lead to a stronger self-similarity of ariation histories at shorter time-scales.\nLooking at our model predictions (see bottom row in Fig. 12 ), they enerally reflect the ACF distributions obtained from simulations, ith a little difference. For THETHREEHUNDRED , the modelled ariation histories are less self-correlated than those from simulations hen \u03b4t < 1 Gyr. On the contrary, the modelled variation histories re more strongly self-correlated than those from the Illustris-1 and NG100-1 simulations when \u03b4t < 2 Gyr. In THETHREEHUNDRED , any SFHs experienced many short-time quenches, in which their FR dropped to 0. The strong self-similarity within a short period in HETHREEHUNDRED could be explained by those continued \u20180SFR\u2019 oints in SFHs. In the Illustris-1 and TNG100-1 simulations, there are hite noise components in their variation histories ( t L ), as shown n Fig. 11 . The white noise components reduce the self-correlation f a time series, resulting in ACF values closer to 0. Both models and simulations exhibit an uncorrelation (ACF \u223c ) at a time-scale of \u03b4t = 4 Gyr, indicating that the variations have otally forgotten their previous state prior to 4 Gyr.\n.3 The complete form of SFH model\nn previous sections, we built up the SFHs along with MS and their ariations separately.

(19) We generate the modelled SFHs in the following procedure: First, e copy the initial galaxies of each SFH from one simulation to form he initial stage of modelled SFHs. This means that the number of amples, the initial mass, and the initial time in a model are exactly the ame as in its corresponding simulation. The mass growth histories f these modelled galaxies are then generated using the formula quation ( 19 ) until redshift z = 0 is reached. In equation ( 19 ), the mo v ement of the MS part\u2019s intercept ( 0 = t L + d ) can merge with the inclination of the variation part ( \u03b1t L + ). We emphasize, ho we ver, that the exact value of these two items as to be measured and determined in two approaches.\nThe free parameter, \u03bc, also known as the mass-loss rate, is ntroduced here to represent the less-sufficient stellar mass growth Speagle et al. 2014 ). Except for the true mass-loss caused by physical rocesses, \u03bc is also affected by the variations of star forming and ergers on time-scales shorter than the time step of snapshots. It s preferable for this mass-loss rate to be time or mass-dependent Leitner & Kravtsov 2011 ; Speagle et al. 2014 ). Jungwiert, Combes & alou \u030cs ( 2001 ) proposed a recipe of cumulative mass-loss rate f ml ( t ) = 0 ln( t / \u03c4 + 1), in which C 0 and \u03bb are free parameters.

Ho we ver, the ituations are more complicated in simulations. We show the mass nd redshift dependence of the mass-loss rate in three simulations\nNRAS 515, 3249\u20133269 (2022)\nn Appendix D for readers who are interested in it. But we will not tudy it further in this work.\nIn this work, we simply test the performance of the mathematical odel described by equation ( 19 ) with arbitrary constant mass-loss ates of 0.5, 0.8, and 0.75 for simulations THETHREEHUNDRED , llustris-1, and TNG100-1, respecti vely. These v alues are determined y matching the stellar mass functions of models and simulations at = 0, which will be shown in next subsection. Keep in mind that the arameter \u03bc is the only free parameter to be fitted in this step. The arameters in the variation part and the MS part keep their values in able 2 hereafter.\n.3.1 Evolution of stellar mass function\no calibrate the performance of \u03bc and variation part of modelled SFH, e compare the final stellar mass functions from simulations and ifferent models.

Be aware hat, for one simulation, its corresponding models have the same istribution of m init . The m init distribution in THETHREEHUNDRED learly distinguishes from those in Illustris-1 and TNG100-1. The istribution of m init is not only affected by the physics and initial ass function. It is also affected by the resolution and algorithm sed to detect progenitors.

The mass-loss rate has a vital role in shaping the stellar mass unction, as can be seen. Without it, i.e. when \u03bc = 0, the galaxies in ur models will be about 1 magnitude o v ersized than in simulations. he effect of mass-loss rate in tuning o v er-sizing of galaxies is more mportant in Illustris-1 and TNG100-1 than in THETHREEHUNDRED . n the other hand, mass-loss rate mainly affects the amplitudes of tellar mass function. The slopes are not changed when mass-loss rate s different. Therefore, whether using a constant or time-dependent ass-loss rate affects little on the final slopes of stellar mass function. The variations of SFHs are also crucial for shaping the slopes f stellar mass functions, as seen in Fig. 13 . We present the m 0 istributions obtained by the model e xclusiv ely with mass growth long the MS (equation ( 12 ), referred as \u2018MS model\u2019 hereafter) or comparison(purple lines). With only the MS part, the final istributions of m 0 are like to keep the shape of distribution of initial tellar mass. This effect is significant in Illustris-1 and TNG100-1. In Fig. 13 , the low mass ends of stellar mass functions are not eco v ered by our model. There are too many small galaxies in our odels. This implies that the small galaxies may have different rowth paths from our model. .3.2 Avera g e PSDs of SFHs ig. 14 shows the PSDs of SFHs from simulations and our models. hree simulations\u2019 average PSDs for SFHs all have a slope of \u22121.5. he simulation THETHREEHUNDRED is different from Illustris-1 and NG100-1 in the PSDs of variations histories. With a slope of \u22121.4, he average PSD of variation histories in THETHREEHUNDRED is very lose to the average PSD of SFHs. In Illustris-1 and THETHREEHUNRED PSDs of SFHs and variation histories are clearly distinguished. heir PSDs of variation histories have less power at lower frequency\nlarger time-scale) region, with a slope of \u22121. This suggest that the ontributions of MS part and variation part in SFHs are different etween THETHREEHUNDRED and Illustris-1/TNG100-1. Be aware hat, although the average PSDs of SFHs from three simulations look lose, the PSDs of individual galaxies differ significantly. As Fig. 15 hows, the PSDs of SFHs in THETHREEHUNDRED are more scattered ut stay within one band. In Illustris-1 and THETHREEHUNDRED SDs are less scattered, but show at least three distinguished bands. Iyer et al. ( 2020 ) showed the average PSDs of SFHs from Illustris-1 nd TNG100-1 in different stellar mass bin. They find that these PSDs ave a slope around \u22122. There are two breaks in Illustris-1 around 0.6\u20131 Gyr and \u223c2.6\u20134.2 Gyr, and have one break in TNG100-1\nround \u223c1.1\u20132.6 Gyr for average PSDs in their work. Our analysis uggests a slope of \u22121.5 for the PSDs of SFHs from simulations. e aware that two works use distinct definitions of star formation ate. We use the instantaneous SFR given by the gas particles in ach snapshot of simulations. Iyer et al. ( 2020 ) tracks the SFH using he ages of star particles. The discrepancy between this work and yer et al. ( 2020 ) shows the impact of different SFR indicator. The reaks of PSDs we found are weak but still can be identified around requency of 1 Gyr \u22121 , as shown in Fig. 15 . PSDs in this work are for ll galaxies, whereas the data in Iyer et al. ( 2020 ) were divided into ifferent stellar mass bins. According to Iyer et al. ( 2020 ), the breaks lter depending on the mass bin. As a result, the breaks of average SDs will be obscured for the entire sample. Although the PSDs of variation histories are well matched between imulations and models, large discrepancy emerges when the MS part s taken into account in our model. When the MS part is added to ariation part, the PSDs rise at both low and high frequency ends. It akes our modelled SFHs have shallower slopes at high frequency nd steeper slopes at low frequency . Additionally , the mass-loss rate ffects the total amplitude of PSD, which does nothing with the slope f PSD. The PSDs of modelled SFHs are not impro v ed when we try o use the median evolutionary mass-loss rate shown in Fig. D1 . We eed SFHs with a higher temporal resolution to solve this problem.\nDI SCUSSI ON & C O N C L U S I O N\nn this work, we have investigated the evolution of SFR in three simlations: THETHREEHUNDRED , Illustris-1, and TNG100-1. We have roposed a mathematical model to match the SFR history of individal galaxy in the three simulations. The model, based on Brownian andom motions on the SFR-mass diagram, turned out to reproduce he major features of galaxy SFHs. Specifically, our model suggests hat the SFR of a galaxy evolves according to this general law:\n( t L ) = MS ( t L , M \u2217( t L )) + ( t L ) = [( at L + b) m + ct L + d] + [ \u03b1t L + \u03b2 + A \u00d7 B H ( t L )] = ( at L + b) m + ( c + \u03b1) t L + ( d + \u03b2) + A \u00d7 B H ( t L )\n\u2261 log SF R m \u2261 log M \u2217 A \u223c N ( \u03bcA , \u03c3A ) , (20)\nhere we separate the SFH of a galaxy into two parts: the trajectory ollowing main sequence ( MS ) and variation component ( ).

In Section 3.1 , we have discussed the evolution of the main equence, based on the function MS ( t L , M \u2217( t L )). We have noticed hat the main sequences differ between simulations, in both the lopes and intercepts. Moreo v er, none of the main sequences in hree simulations match the observational main sequence, despite he fact that they can all statistically reproduce some observational uantities, such as the star formation rate density and stellar mass unction. The differences of MS can pro vide quantitativ e information o understand the effect of the physics behind the simulations. Another important component of SFR evolution is the variation art of the MS, which is linked to the internal or external galaxy rocesses that regulate the SFR and produce sudden variations. e are moti v ated by pre vious works (e.g. K elson 2014 ; Caplar & acchella 2019 ; Iyer et al. 2020 ;Tacchella et al. 2020 ; ) to assume hat the variations of the SFR are stochastic processes that can be epresented by inclined fractional Brownian motions. In Section 3.2 , e have introduced our method to reproduce the variation in SFH. e have used the mean variation, mean squared variation, starburst ime, quenching time, starburst duration, and quenched duration to onstrain the parameters of our variation history model. The resulting odels can predict the majority features of the time series of the ariational histories, including their ACF and PSD. Although the odel does not fully reco v er all these quantities from simulations, e have shown that the fractional Brownian motion can reproduce ajority of variation histories. On the other hand, the divergence\netween models and simulations suggests that some processes like rolonged quenching and noisy-like fluctuation are not negligible. ccording to our results, the SFHs in THETHREEHUNDRED contain ore quench stages besides Brownian motions, compared with other wo simulations. On the other hand, Illustris-1 and TNG100-1 SFHs eed multiple kinds of stochastic process, like white noise, in addition o the fractional Brownian motion to reproduce their features (see igs 11 and 15 ). We try to combine two parts together in Section 3.3 . The complete odel can reco v er the stellar mass function. But the PSDs of odelled SFHs is quite different from simulations. We suggest that\nNRAS 515, 3249\u20133269 (2022)\nt is caused by the inaccuracy of mass-loss rate and low temporal esolution of SFH.\nCaplar & Tacchella ( 2019 ) proposed a method quite similar to ur model to construct the stochastic process of MS history. The ariation of SFH in their model was defined through a power pectrum density with a functional form of a broken power law, where he key characteristics are the time-scale of uncorrelation \u03c4 break and lope of power-law \u03b1. The fractional Brownian motion is basically subset of the stochastic process produced by the broken power aw. Since the broken power-law method can reproduce stochastic eries with all ranges of PSDs. The fractional Brownian motion x es its power-la w slope to \u22122 H \u2212 1 when H < 0.5 and to \u22122 hen H > 0.5. The Hurst parameter in fractional Brownian motion s quite close to the burstiness parameter in Caplar & Tacchella 2019 ). It can be related to \u03c4 break and slope of PSD. Figure A1 n Caplar & Tacchella ( 2019 ) shows the relations between Hurst arameter, \u03c4 break , and the slope. The power slope \u03b1 \u22122 is a v oured in most theoretical and observational works (e.g. Caplar & acchella 2019 ). But our model suggests that the variations in imulations are more likely to have a slope shallower than that, .g. \u223c\u22121.4 for THETHREEHUNDRED and \u223c\u22121.1 for Illustris-1 and HETHREEHUNDRED . Moreo v er, we find that the PSDs of variations nd SFHs do not have the same slope, which is observed in the imulations Illustris-1 and THETHREEHUNDRED .\nIn future works, we will impro v e our model\u2019s flaws. First, we ill experiment with various stochastic processes outside fractional rownian motion. We might try assigning different stochastic process o galaxies of various types or masses. Secondly, quenching process eeds to be considered besides a normal stochastic process. Third, e need to establish a compatible function for the mass-loss rate in imulations. Moreo v er a simulation with a higher output frequency an help us impro v e the model. As we find in this work, the large ime step between snapshots brings uncertainties in constructing the FH of an individual galaxy. On the other hand, we will explore the link between parameters of ur mathematical models and the sub-grid physics in simulations, hich will help calibrating the influence of sub-grid physics in\nFigure 15.

We conv ert their MS formula to be in the same nits as ours. For example, in Iyer et al. ( 2018 )\u2019s text, the original escription of MS is as follows: log SF R = (0 . 80 \u00b1 0 . 029 \u2212 0 . 017 \u00b1 0 . 010 t univ ) log M \u2217 \u2212 (6 . 487 \u00b1 0 . 282 \u2212 0 . 039 \u00b1 0 . 008 t univ ) .

(B2)\nBoth the Speagle et al. ( 2014 ) and Iyer et al. ( 2018 ) studies imply hat the MS has a higher slope and somewhat lower intercept at early tages. In Speagle et al. ( 2014 ), the stellar mass range of galaxies is round 10 9.7 \u201310 11.1 M . The samples in Iyer et al. ( 2018 ) range from 0 7 to 10 11 M . Lower mass galaxies have MS that is closer to the MS in Iyer et al. 2018 ) because they are less massive than \u223c7 in Illustris-1or sim 8 n TNG100-1. For MS of galaxies with a mass greater than 10 8 M ,\nhe discrepancy between simulations and observations cannot be gnored.\nIt\u2019s important to note that the observations do not all agree n how MS is evolving. For example, Whitaker et al. ( 2012 ) ound that the slope of MS is 0.70 \u2212 0.13 z, which is in direct ontrast to Speagle et al. ( 2014 ) (0.84 \u2212 0.026 t univ ) and Iyer et al. 2018 )(0.80 \u2212 0.017 t univ ). These uncertainties are most likely caused y SFR measurements and sample selection. Whitaker et al. ( 2014 ) ound that the evolution of the MS slope may differ for different SFR ndicators at M \u2217 < 10 10.2 M .\nGenerally, there are distinctions between simulations and simulaions, as well as between simulations and observations. To reconcile ll this contradictory evidence, it is important to match the evolution f the SFR main sequence between simulations and observations. ndeed, in order to fully understand the physical processes underlying he evolution of the SFR main sequence and possibly impro v e he hydro-dynamical recipes in simulations, it seems crucial to (1) omogenize the observational results and (2) match the definition of he quantities derived from simulations and observations.\nPPENDI X C : A NA LY T I C A L TERM O F MASS RO W T H FOLLO W I N G MS\nrom equation ( 12 ), we can expand 0 and k as follows:\nd M \u2217( t L ) d t L = \u221210 0 M k \u2217 = \u221210 ct L + d M at L + b \u2217 (C1)\nMNRAS 515, 3249\u20133269 (2022)\nM\n+ c H i t\nM\nw\ni t o\nA O\nT T F S c\nS t u m t i i I i r s t\nFigure D1.

Beause those points with SFR ( t ) = 0 will lead to infinity values for \u03bc( t ).\nFig. D1 depicts the change of mass-increment rates of individual FHs and their median trends in three simulations. As can be seen,\nhe mass-increment ratio of individual SFH is volatile. The main ncertainties come from the large fluctuations of star formation, ergers, and gas flows hidden between two snapshots. Because he time interval is substantially larger than the time-scale for nstantaneous SFR of particles in simulations, the integration of nstantaneous SFR across two snapshots has a significant bias. n this case, strictly following the mass-loss rate in simulations s almost impossible. Alternatively, using the average mass-loss ate in equation ( 19 ) will modify the pace of mass growth, and ubsequently change the characteristics such as PSD and ACF of he SFH.\nNRAS 515, 3249\u20133269 (2022)\nigure D2.
