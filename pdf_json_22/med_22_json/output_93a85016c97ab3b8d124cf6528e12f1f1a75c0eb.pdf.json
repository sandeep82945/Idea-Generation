We simulated three emerging variant scenarios: (1) no new variants; (2) 25% more infectious and immuneevading Omicron-level severity variants emerge annually and become dominant; (3) emerge biannually. We further explored the impact of varying seasonality, variant immune-evading capacity, infectivity, severity, timing, and vaccine infection blocking assumptions.

            "text": "Between December 2019 and May 2022, 529 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and [ 6.29 million COVID-19-related deaths were reported [1]. As of May 2022, [ 11.9 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses have been administered worldwide, but as SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to spread, increasing global vaccine coverage will be crucial. Rollout strategies for first and second vaccine doses are being combined with subsequent booster doses to bolster immunity levels. Rapid viral evolution and the relatively short period that COVID-19 vaccines have been available have limited our ability to observe vaccine efficacy and duration over long periods. For example, studies have reported effectiveness against symptomatic disease from the Omicron variant following a booster dose with an mRNA vaccine to resume to levels similar to those following dose 2 [2, 3]. This is reassuring for those who received their booster dose and are thus benefiting from a lower probability of becoming infected and developing COVID-19-related disease, but highlights the need for a longer-term vaccination strategy that accounts for waning immunity, particularly with the likelihood of the emergence of new immune-evading variants of concern.\nPrior to Omicron subvariants, new SARSCoV-2 variants had emerged and become dominant about every 6 months [4], and while the overall risk of severe disease or death from Omicron infection is lower than from the previously dominant Delta variant [5], Omicron subvariants are more infectious and their rapid spread is still causing health system stress. LongCOVID may also continue to contribute to the public health burden. Furthermore, variants of the Omicron lineage are continuing to evolve and make gains by eroding host immunity. If this continues, then SARS-CoV-2 epidemics may reach steady state and become endemic similar to influenza. In this case, however, when population-wide immunity declines, circulating variants with immune-evading mutations could become dominant and may potentially be more severe, and periodic waves may arise [4]. This emphasises the urgency for everyone to receive\nat least one COVID-19 vaccine and highlights the need for strategic delivery of vaccine booster doses.\nUsing our individual-based SARS-CoV-2 transmission model, OpenCOVID, we simulated a variety of vaccination strategies and model assumptions to identify the preferred frequency, timing, and target population for future vaccine booster doses in light of potential emerging viral variants. Model outcomes are used to assess the impact of different booster strategies on public health outcomes and health system risks."

            "text": "Our individual-based model, OpenCOVID, is a dynamic stochastic discrete-time model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and COVID-19 disease progression and response [6]. The model simulates viral transmission between infectious and susceptible individuals that come in contact through an age-structured, small-world network. The probability of transmission in each exposure stage is influenced by the infectiousness of the infected individual, the immunity of the susceptible individual (acquired through previous infection and/or through vaccination), and a background seasonality pattern (reflecting a larger proportion of contacts being in closer contact indoors as the temperatures became cooler). Infectiousness is a function of variant infectivity and time since infection. Once infected, a latency period is followed by a pre-symptomatic stage, after which an individual can experience asymptomatic, mild, or severe disease. Severe cases can lead to hospitalisation, intensive care unit admission, and ultimately death (see Table S1 in the Electronic Supplementary Material for further details on prognosis probabilities by age following infection with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant). Recovery after infection leads to development of immunity. This immunity is assumed to wane over time as illustrated in Figure S1, with the risk of new infection depending on the probability of exposure and\nproperties of existing and potential novel SARSCOV-2 variants (i.e., infectiousness and immune evading profile). Briefly, the model captures immunity decay for naturally acquired and vaccine-induced infection and seasonality (as illustrated in the Electronic Supplementary Material Figures S1 and S2, respectively); infection states and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) can be included (as further described in the \u2018\u2018Methods\u2019\u2019 section \u2018\u2018Non-pharmaceutical Interventions\u2019\u2019).

The best estimate for the seasonal scaling factor was taken from a previous study assessing the COVID-19 epidemic in Switzerland [6]. This previous study simultaneously fit this seasonal scaling factor parameter along with several other parameters to align the OpenCOVID model to epidemiological data.

However, since a proportion of the population will likely continue to wear masks in some situations such as on public transport in certain settings, this protective effect was captured indirectly by using the number of effective network contacts to calibrate the model to the effective reproduction number at the start of the simulation period."

Second, once infected, vaccines reduce the probability of developing severe symptoms, leading to reduced hospitalisations, intensive care unit admissions, and potentially death.\nIndividuals who previously received primary vaccination (doses one and two) prior to the start of the simulation period were considered eligible to receive booster doses. Default universal coverage of booster doses was set to 98% coverage of those eligible. We assume 1500 booster doses per 100,000 people per day (1.5% of the simulated population) could be administered based on achievable vaccine delivery rates across several countries [8].

We found that the biggest relative impact was from annual boosting of all those eligible, which was consistent with or without new emerging variants (Fig. 1, blue dashed and solid curves, respectively), given the assumptions modelled for waning immunity. In the case where no new variants emerge, boosting only those most vulnerable every 12 months led to a 32% (95% CI 24\u201340%) reduction in hospital admissions over a 2-year\nperiod compared with no boosters. If annual boosting were to be expanded to those eligible, a 70% (95% CI 65\u201373%) reduction in hospitalisations could be achieved over this period. If boosting frequency were increased to every 6 months and targeted to only those most vulnerable (while continuing to boost those eligible annually), then a 77% (95% CI 74\u201380%) reduction could be realised, an over two-fold decrease in admissions. Extending biannual boosting to those eligible is projected to have diminishing returns, with an 81% (95% CI 79\u201383%) reduction in hospitalisations over this period, keeping in mind that the numbers of booster doses required per 100,000 people per year for these four strategies (annual boosting of most vulnerable, eligible annually, vulnerable biannually with eligible annually, and eligible biannually) is 26,000, 78,000, 104,000, and 156,000, respectively, with those most\nvulnerable representing a third of those eligible to receive boosters.\nSimilar trends were observed when variants that are 25% more infectious and immune evading, but similar in severity as the Omicron variant, emerged annually and became dominant, although overall reductions in hospitalisations were more modest than when no variant emerged. Over the 2-year study period, if variants were to emerge biannually then 15% (95% CI 3\u201325%) of hospitalisations could be averted if only those most vulnerable were boosted yearly and 27% (95% CI 17\u201334%) if those eligible were boosted yearly compared with no boosters.

Assuming a new variant emerges annually, we find that hospitalisations could be reduced by 37% (95% CI 30\u201348%) with universal boosting (98% coverage of those eligible), dropping to 26% (95% CI 18\u201332%) with lower coverage (Fig. 3D, light and dark blue curves, respectively).\nTo reduce SARS-COV-2 infections and COVID-19-related hospital admissions when a new variant of concern emerges annually ahead of the winter season, we found that the best time to deliver annual COVID-19 booster doses is 3\u20134 months before peak winter when people tend to remain indoors most often and their\nnumber of contacts increases as does their probability of SARS-CoV-2 transmission (see Fig. 4, and Figure S16A in the Electronic Supplementary Material for details). The seasonality profile as illustrated in Figure S2 of the Electronic Supplementary Material, with the seasonality forcing scaler varied in the sensitivity analysis as shown in Fig. 5, will affect these results. In addition, for this modelling study by default it was assumed booster vaccines were rolled out to 1.5% of the population every day. No effect was observed if the daily boosting capacity was reduced to 0.75% or increased to 2.25% (results not shown in Fig. 5).\nFor all key parameters that were varied, annual boosting consistently provides the\nFig. 4 Projected cumulative annual impact on new SARSCoV-2 infections (A) and COVID-19-related hospital admissions (B) of delivering vaccine boosters to all those eligible 5 years of age and older from either 6 months before to 2 months after peak winter temperatures assuming a 25% more infectious and immune-evading\nnovel variant but with the same severity as the Omicron variant emerges prior to the fall season.

Higher variant infectivity and higher immune-evading capacity most reduced the effect of boosters (see Fig. 5L, M). The largest relative effect of biannual boosting was observed under lower seasonal effect (see Fig. 5H), in which case biannual boosting is responsible for half the percentage of hospitalisations averted [15% (95% CI 10\u201319%)] compared with annual boosters [30% (95% CI 26\u201334%)].\nAs an indication of cost-effectiveness, we found that more hospitalisations could be averted per booster dose through annual boosting of those most vulnerable versus all those eligible over the study period (see Figure S17 in the Electronic Supplementary Material for details). This can be attributed to the\nhigher likelihood of those most vulnerable needing hospitalisation following SARS-CoV-2 infection, in this case those 60 years of age and older or those living with comorbidities, compared with those less vulnerable to infection. This finding was robust even when key model parameters were varied, again showing diminishing returns per dose when boosting frequency is increased to every 6 months. However, only boosting those most vulnerable (60? or with comorbidities) may not be sufficient to prevent exceeding health system capacity thresholds (Fig. 6)."

At the time of writing, our findings were consistent with a commentary from the chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, who stated that, based on data for the UK, the country should be planning the roll-out of boosters to their entire population this autumn [13]. Consistent with our study, a review also found that booster vaccinations should be prioritised to high-risk groups, such as the elderly and people with immunodeficiency, but that not everyone needs\nto receive a booster dose 6 months after dose two [14]. We found that, under our current assumptions for naturally acquired and vaccineinduced immunity waning, only boosting those most vulnerable (defined as those 60 years of age or older or people living with comorbidities) may be insufficient to ensure reduced stress on health systems, whereas increasing the frequency of boosters to every 6 months (to those most vulnerable or all those eligible) showed diminishing returns. Importantly, we showed that boosting all those eligible protects those most vulnerable more than only boosting this vulnerable group, with important vaccine strategy implications for the forthcoming\nFig. 6 Cumulative projected impact of administering COVID-19 vaccine boosters to those most vulnerable or to all those eligible every 12 months on COVID-19-related hospital admissions by age and risk group over a 2-year period in a simulated population of 100,000 individuals when new SARS-CoV-2 variants with 25% more infectiousness and immune-evading capacity than the previously\ndominant variant but with the same severity as Omicron emerge annually.

Moreover, given the early and large influenza epidemic that has been ongoing in Australia over their winter season, which has led to increased health system stress, it is even more critical to re-evaluate vaccination strategies now. All efforts should be made to reduce COVID-19-related stress on health systems ahead of the anticipated influenza season in the Northern hemisphere. These results are robust when key model parameters were varied. However, for all results, the more frequently variants with mounting infectiousness emerge, the less effect vaccine boosters will have, regardless of whether boosters are administered annually or biannually.\nResources needed to administer booster doses more often and more extensively should be measured against the predicted benefit to public health and health systems capacity, as well as any potential health risks associated with ongoing booster administration. These include dose supply (including global equity in distribution), effort, and cost required to increase the frequency. Should the number of COVID-19-related hospital admissions averted per booster dose administered be used as a health savings proxy metric for cost-effectiveness, then more hospitalisations could be averted per booster dose through annual boosting of those most vulnerable versus all eligible even when assumption values for variant infectivity, immune-evading capacity, vaccine infection blocking, seasonality effect, variant severity, and variant timing are increased or decreased within assumed bounds, and under assumptions for waning immunity and study settings. However, only boosting those most vulnerable may be insufficient to prevent health system risk.\nVaccination hesitancy and fatigue must also factor into this assessment and be considered as part of vaccine booster campaigns and messaging; lessons can be learned from seasonal influenza strategies. Even if there were no challenges surrounding vaccine hesitancy and repeated booster fatigue, we cannot boost indefinitely against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease. Regardless, evidence from this study suggests that more frequent boosting to every 6 months has diminishing returns on\ninvestment (see Fig. 2). Should booster doses not be available or not be accepted particularly as more infectious and potentially more severe subvariants emerge, hospital admissions may once again overwhelm health systems. This compounded with the potential for double epidemics with influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (as has been reported in Australia [15]) escalates the need for stronger preparedness for such eventualities given the high mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 [16]. Therefore, it is prudent for countries to continue targeting and supporting vaccination boosting campaigns for all. Since it is anticipated that more infectious and immune-escaping variants will continue to emerge, existing vaccines may become insensitive to new variants, which reinforces the need for effective adapted and possibly multivalent vaccines with longer durations, coupled with plans for adjusted and improved strategies over the years."

While it is important to consider scaling up booster strategies, the WHO warns that broad-based COVID-19 booster programmes, including delivering additional booster vaccinations to groups at lower risk of developing severe disease may prolong the global pandemic by diverting supply to nations with already high coverage and therefore away from nations with low coverage, giving the virus more chance to spread and mutate [18]. Given that 2.7 billion people had still not even received their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine as of the end of May 2022 [19], WHO experts have urged prioritising first doses over boosters [18]. Similarly, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, advocates for the global community to focus on ensuring every adult receives at least one dose in 2022 [19]."

Medical oxygen supplies and distribution have been strengthened in many countries [21]. In addition, oral antivirals to treat COVID-19 have been authorised for inpatient and home use in several countries as well hospital-administered injectable monoclonal antibodies are now available. These pharmaceutical interventions, together with mask usage and physical distancing measures being observed to varying degrees across settings, and coupled with increasing vaccination rates and natural immunity from previous infection, may make certain settings better positioned to mitigate and respond to the subsequent COVID-19 waves. Nevertheless, with continuing spread of Omicron subvariants, even if Omicron infection causes less severe disease, should cases spike again, a smaller proportion of a large number of cases needing hospitalisation may again lead to health system stress.\nWhile increasing vaccination coverage is a good solution to reducing the burden from COVID-19, a sizable proportion of the population continues to refuse vaccination in high-, middle-, and even low-income settings [22]. Even though testing rates have begun to plateau [23], meaning cases are likely being underreported, ongoing SARS-CoV-2 transmission will inevitably result in the emergence of new SARSCoV-2 variants or subvariants of concern. This is why it is important to be strategic with COVID-19 vaccination campaigns. As we cannot continue to boost for COVID-19 indefinitely, in effort to avoid vaccination fatigue and to better protect against new variants, secondgeneration vaccines that are multivalent, meaning they protect better against more than one SARS-CoV-2 variant and will remain more effective, longer, are being developed and approved. Under the booster strategy recommended in this study, more effective (as shown in the sensitivity analysis conducted in this study) and longer lasting second-generation\nbooster vaccines will avert even more infections and hospital admissions than were predicted here using first-generation boosters."

Within our individual-based transmission model, transition between disease states and chance to be infected include probabilities for infection, transmission, and disease severity, based on studies cited in [6]. These probabilities will influence model outcomes and our conclusions on vaccination so sensitivity analysis was conducted on several parameters. First, we identified that Omicron\u2019s potential severity had little effect on the number of new cases projected, also because no impact on viral load was assumed. Higher viral load in the model is associated with increased transmissibility. Second, values higher or lower than 1.0 for the effective reproduction number at the start of the winter period, prior to introduction of Omicron, may influence peak hospital admissions estimates; however, the relative impact of vaccination is not sensitive to this parameter. Third, this study only considers direct admissions to hospital due to COVID-19, but does not consider COVID-19-related admissions due to certain long-COVID health consequences. Therefore, there is the potential for additional health system burden not modelled here. Fourth, we did not model the effect of any NPIs, but we assume re-implementing NPIs could be considered if thresholds for case numbers or health system capacity were reached. We also acknowledge that booster vaccines began to be rolled out as early as fall 2021 in certain countries, whereas we simulated booster administration starting in spring 2022. Last, depending on emerging variant profile and vaccine coverage levels, should naturally acquired and/or vaccine-induced immunity have different protection levels and/or should immunity wane differently (speed, decay type) than what was assumed, then the population would be more or less protected and our projected outcomes may prove to be too pessimistic\nor too optimistic. We did not model the effect of hybrid immunity, which occurs when an individual experiences both naturally acquired and vaccine-induced immunity. Recent studies have identified hybrid immunity to provide a higher level of protection against infection and severe disease than we assumed in the model [24\u201326]. Since new SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, and therefore infections, will continue to emerge, and vaccinations will continue to need to be implemented, the prevalence of hybrid immunity will increase. This will affect population susceptibility, especially in the long term. As more is known about hybrid immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease, this should be considered as part of future modelling studies and when interpreting these results."
