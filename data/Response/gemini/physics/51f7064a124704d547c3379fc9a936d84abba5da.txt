1. **Investigate the effect of different types of biomass on the properties of IPN bio-based silica gels.**

This study used Konjac mannan as the biomass source to prepare IPN bio-based silica gels. However, other types of biomass, such as cellulose, hemicellulose, and starch, could also be used. It would be interesting to compare the properties of IPN bio-based silica gels prepared from different types of biomass to determine the effect of biomass type on gel properties.


2. **Explore the use of IPN bio-based silica gels for other applications.**

The study focused on the use of IPN bio-based silica gels for insulation and fire-retardant applications. However, these gels could also be used for other applications, such as catalysis, drug delivery, and tissue engineering. It would be valuable to explore the potential of IPN bio-based silica gels for these and other applications.


3. **Investigate the long-term stability of IPN bio-based silica gels.**

The study did not assess the long-term stability of IPN bio-based silica gels. It would be important to conduct long-term stability studies to determine how these gels perform over time. This information would be valuable for assessing the potential of IPN bio-based silica gels for practical applications.


4. **Develop methods to functionalize IPN bio-based silica gels.**

The study did not explore methods to functionalize IPN bio-based silica gels. Functionalization could be used to improve the properties of these gels or to make them responsive to specific stimuli. It would be valuable to develop methods to functionalize IPN bio-based silica gels and to explore the potential of these functionalized gels for various applications.


5. **Investigate the use of IPN bio-based silica gels in combination with other materials.**

The study focused on the properties of IPN bio-based silica gels alone. However, these gels could also be used in combination with other materials to create composites with tailored properties. It would be interesting to explore the potential of IPN bio-based silica gels in combination with other materials for various applications.
