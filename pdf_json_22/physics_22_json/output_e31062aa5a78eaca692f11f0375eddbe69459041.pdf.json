            "text": "In order to study turbulent combustion in practical engines via computational analysis, it is necessary to establish sub-grid flamelet models which can be coupled with large-eddy simulations. The models must provide the burning rate based on the magnitudes of the strain rates and vorticity imposed by the larger turbulent flow. Since the flames are known to occur at smaller scales than the largest eddies in the flow, they often cannot be resolved by direct numerical simulation, thereby requiring a separate analysis. Fortunately, the flames typically occur on small scales where laminar behavior may be assumed. The purpose of this study is to give some foundation to recent threedimensional flamelet models1\u20133 based on vortex stretching. Specifically, those models assume an asymptotic form whereby the scalar variables and the three components of velocity vary with only one spatial variable. Our aim here is to show whether and how a three-dimensional structure consisting of a shear layer with vortex stretching will asymptotically, with growing downstream distance, yield a dependence on only the transverse position across the shear layer. Both reacting and non-reacting cases will be examined.\nA useful flamelet model must have a statistically accurate representation of the relative orientations on this smallest scale of the vorticity vector, scalar gradients, and the directions of the three principal axes for strain rate. Several studies with direct numerical simulations (DNS) exist that are helpful in understanding this important alignment issue for application to turbulent flows. Certainly for incompressible flow and generally for variable-density flow, one principal strain rate \u03b3 locally will be compressive, another principal strain rate \u03b1 will be tensile, and the third can be either extensional or compressive and will have an intermediate strain rate \u03b2 of lower magnitude than the other like strain rate. Specifically, \u03b1 > \u03b2 > \u03b3, \u03b1 > 0, \u03b3 < 0, and, for incompressible flow, \u03b1 +\u03b2 + \u03b3 = 0. Betchov4 indicates that, for incompressible, homogeneous, isotropic turbulence, the case with \u03b2 > 0 is most important for vorticity production and the turbulence energy cascade to smaller scales. Ashurst et al.5 and Nomura and Elghobashi6 show that the vorticity alignment with the intermediate strain direction is most probable in both cases of homogeneous sheared turbulence and isotropic turbulence but especially in the case with shear. They find that the intermediate strain rate is most likely to be extensive (positive). Dresselhaus7 predicts the tendency for alignment of the intermediate strain direction with the vorticity. Kerr8 reports that large\nvalues of helicity are not found in the turbulence cascade process, thereby indicating that vorticity does not have strong alignment with the major compressive or major tensile strain direction.\nNomura and Elghobashi9 find, for reacting turbulent flow, that in regions of heat release and variable density, alignment of the vorticity with the most tensile strain direction can occur. As the strain rates increase, the intermediate direction becomes more favored for vorticity alignment. The scalar gradient and the direction of compressive strain are commonly aligned5,6,9\u201311 . There is wide agreement that the most common intermittent vortex structures in regions of high strain rate are sheets or ribbons rather than tubes.\nBased on those understandings concerning vector orientations, one may construct a flamelet model based upon superposition of a strained counterflow and flow structure with vorticity. Such models have recently been created1\u20133. They are three-dimensional in the sense that three velocity components are determined, generally with some dependence on three spatial coordinates. However, the scalar variables in the counterflow configuration are dependent on one variable. Here, we attempt to provide support for the findings by showing it can easily occur as the downstream asymptote for a shear layer subject to a compressive strain in the transverse direction. Following the guidance from the cited DNS studies, we choose a shear-layer configuration with the scalar gradient and direction of compressive normal strain aligned with each other and orthogonal to the vorticity vector. Any shear layer is also a vortex layer because vorticity is present in the sheet-like configuration. The imposed counterflow in our situation results in a stretched vortex layer.\nAs noted above, there is evidence from the DNS literature that these vortex layers or sheets can exist in both non-reacting and reacting turbulent flows. Further evidence is provided by stability analyses for incompressible flows. For non-reacting flows, Neu12 works with Burgers stretched vortex sheet showing that it can be stable; however, for sufficient vortex strength (or insufficient imposed strain rate), it becomes unstable causing formation of a periodic array of rolled-up concentrated vortices with stretched braids. Corcos and Sherman13 address stability of a purely twodimensional viscous vortex sheet without describing it as Burgers stretched vortex sheet. The roll-up of the two-dimensional flow is examined. Corcos and Lin14 study the stability under threedimensional perturbations. Lin and Corcos15 study the phenomenon further exploring streamwise vorticity. The general implication for turbulent combustion and flamelet theory is that a vortical layer or sheet can exist. However, it can also become unstable through the roll-up mechanism leading to larger vortex-tube structures. This is consistent with the observation from DNS5,6,9\u201311 and experiment16 that both vortex layers and vortex tubes can exist in the same turbulent flow field.\nThis study relates to some interesting classical work on temporal, viscous vortex layers and vortex tubes subject to normal strain. A finding in those studies was that a balance between the diffusion and advection of vorticity could be achieved, resulting in a steady-state solution. Burgers17, followed by Rott18, examined the axisymmetric behavior of a stretched vortex tube for incompressible flow. The stretching (extensive or tensile strain) in the direction aligned with the vorticity vector resulted in an inward swirling motion. The steady-state solution of the axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equation (known as Burgers stretched vortex tube) requires a matching of vorticity strength and viscosity such that radially outward diffusion of vorticity and radially inward advection of vorticity are in balance. The two-dimensional analog of the stretched vortex tube involves a viscous shear layer, which is simultaneously a vortex layer, subject to normal compressive strain in a direction orthogonal to the shear-layer stream direction and with the associated tensile strain aligned with the vortex vector. The solution of the steady-state configuration for this vortex layer has been attributed to unpublished work presented in lectures by Burgers19. The two-dimensional analog is also mentioned without attribution by Batchelor20 where this layer is described as a vortex sheet. Neu12 refers to this two-dimensional layer as the \u201cstretched Burgers vortex sheet\u201d. Note that, in contrast, the description \u201cvortex sheet\u201d for an inviscid flow implies a mathematical discontinuity in velocity and a vortex sheet of zero thickness; see Saffman21.\nThe incompressible velocity field defined by Burgers stretched vortex sheet has ux, uy, and uz as the velocity components. The imposed normal strain rate S, kinematic viscosity \u03bd , and free-stream velocity magnitude U are taken as positive constants. As y\u2192 \u221e, ux(x,y,z, t)\u2192U , \u2202uy/\u2202y\u2192 \u2013S, and \u2202uz/\u2202 z\u2192 S. And, as y\u2192\u2212\u221e, ux(x,y,z, t)\u2192\u2212U , \u2202uy/\u2202y\u2192 \u2013S, and \u2202uz/\u2202 z\u2192 S. Then, the exact steady-state solution to the Navier-Stokes equations is found for the velocity components and the vorticity \u03c9z whereby\nux =U erf (\u221a S 2\u03bd y ) ; uy =\u2212Sy ; uz = Sz\nand\n\u03c9z =\u2212 \u2202ux \u2202y\n=\u2212U \u221a\nS 2\u03c0\u03bd\nexp ( \u2212 Sy 2 2\u03bd ) .\nAlthough the sheet is being stretched in the z-direction, diffusion of momentum and vorticity in the y-direction allows a balance with advection in the y-direction that results in a steady solution.\nOur analysis considers a steady, spatially developing shear layer in the x-direction with a twodimensional imposed strain in the yz-plane. The imposed strain can affect the growth of shear-layer\nwidth with downstream distance. In principle, if the imposed strain rate is constant with x, an asymptote should be reached downstream where layer thickness becomes constant, which resembles Burgers stretched vortex sheet. Variable density with low Mach number will be considered. Both reacting and non-reacting flows will be studied."

            "text": "Laminar, two-dimensional shear layers with mixing of fuel and oxidizer and resulting diffusion flames is a classical subject of study. See Williams22. Two-dimensional planar and axisymmetric counterflow configurations of laminar diffusion flames have been studied extensively: Lina\u0301n23, Peters24, Williams25, Pierce & Moin26. More recently, Rajamanickam et al.27 considered a threedimensional flame configuration with both counterflow and a mixing layer which resulted in a spanwise stretching; however, the use of a uniform Oseen velocity avoided the effects of shear and vorticity. In a series of papers, Sirignano28\u201331 has considered three-dimensional flame configuration with shear, counterflow (and associated stretching), mixing, and combustion. Here, we extend the work of Sirignano31 who considered similar and approximately similar solutions that reduced the order of the problem to one-dimensional equations. We will reduce the three-dimensional problem to a two-dimensional system of equations to consider spatial development of the layer.\nOur formulation builds on some classical treatments of shear layers and boundary layers with variable density. Crocco32 studied effects due to viscous heat generation for compressible flow over a two-dimensional flat plate. Howarth33, Illingworth34, and Stewartson35 found compressible solutions by using a modification factor for incompressible solutions for a suite of related boundary layer problems.\nSome time later, combustion scientists addressed counterflows where fuel and oxidizer streams oppose each other. Lina\u0301n23 found analytical solutions to such a counterflow problem using onestep Arrhenius chemistry. Bilger36 used a more robust expression for chemical rate. Lina\u0301n & Williams37 extended the problem to account for temporal variation. There is uniform agreement that the presence of strain due to counterflow inhibits flame growth and temperature. Essentially, residence time can be considered as the reciprocal of strain rate.\nThe recent study31 addresses three-dimensional, steady laminar flow structures with mixing, chemical reaction, normal strain and shear strain. The problem is reduced to a two-dimensional form. A one-dimensional similar solution is developed. This present study reconsiders the non-\nreactive and reactive case of the two-dimensional form of the governing equations. In particular, these equations are expressed as a stepwise algorithm to solve the two-dimensional flow numerically, which allows consideration of many different parameter cases related to Prandtl number, chemical composition, and free-stream velocity ratios. The analysis here of the non-reactive case focuses on the mixing between gaseous oxygen at a temperature of 800 K and gaseous propane at 23 \u00d7 800 = 533 K. The analysis of the reactive case considers both ambient streams to have a temperature of 300 K with an initial peak ignitor temperature of 2000 K. Both cases include imposed normal strain and shear strain. Various Prandtl numbers, free-stream horizontal velocity ratios, and free-stream enthalpy ratios are considered.\nIn Section II, the analysis is presented. Results for three different configurations are presented\nin Section III with Conclusions following in Section IV."

Radiation and gravity are not considered. At the low speeds considered, heat generation via viscous dissipation is neglected.\nThe compressive counterflow imposed in the y-direction causes a symmetry for pressure and an anti-symmetry for the w-component of velocity in the z-direction. w behaves according to the stagnation flow profile w = \u03baz neglecting terms of O(z2) in the yz-plane31. Positive values of \u03ba\nindicate that the flow field is stretched in the z-direction. To the same order, all other quantities are considered constant with z.

Under the boundary-layer approximation, pressure variation with y is neglected in the x-momentum equation. So, f is a function only of x. Therefore, the continuity equation (1) and z-momentum equation (3) become\n\u2202 (\u03c1u) \u2202x + \u2202 (\u03c1v) \u2202y +\u03c1\u03ba = 0 (7)\nand\n\u03c1u \u2202\u03ba \u2202x +\u03c1v \u2202\u03ba \u2202y +\u03c1\u03ba2\u2212 f (x)2 = \u2202 \u2202y (\u00b5 \u2202\u03ba \u2202y ) (8)\nrespectively. u, v, \u03c1 , and \u03ba vary with x and y, but not with z. Consistent with boundary-layer theory, Eq. (7) will be considered to govern velocity component v while Eqs. (2, 4, 5, 8) govern u,h,Ym, and \u03ba , respectively.\nFor the non-reactive case, \u03c9\u0307F = \u03c9\u0307O = 0. For the reactive case, a one-step chemical kinetics term appears in the energy and mass-fraction equations. One stream is composed of oxygen or a fuel-lean mixture while the other stream is composed of propane or a fuel-rich mixture. m = O corresponds to O2 and m = F corresponds to C3H8. The reaction rates of each gas are related by \u03c9\u0307m = \u03c9\u0307F/\u03bdm, where \u03bdm and is the stoichiometric ratio between propane and gas m by mass. \u03bd is provided in Table I for each species. Q is the heating value of propane per unit mass.\nWe follow the Westbrook & Dryer38 one-step reaction rate for propane,\n\u03c9\u0307F =\u2212A\u03c10.75Y 1.65O Y 0.10F e\u2212Ea/R1T\u221eh \u2217 , (9)\nwhere A = 4.788\u00d7108 (kg/m3)\u22120.75/s is a reaction rate constant.

The activation energy of propane in oxygen is Ea = 30.0 kcalmol .\nIn order to make the results more general, the following normalized non-dimensional variables\nare created:\nx\u2217 = xx0 ; u \u2217 = uu\u221e ; h \u2217 = hh\u221e ; \u03c1 \u2217 = \u03c1\u03c1\u221e y\u2217 = y\u03b40 ; v \u2217 = \u221a Re0 u\u221e v ; \u03ba\u2217 = x 2 0 \u03b40u\u221e \u03ba ; \u00b5 \u2217 = \u00b5\u00b5\u221e z\u2217 = z\u03b40 ; w \u2217 = \u221a Re0 u\u221e w ; f \u2217(x) = x0u\u221e\u221a\u03c1\u221e f (x \u2217) ; Q\u2217 = Qh\u221e Da = Ax0\u03c1 0.75 \u221e\nu\u221e ; Re0 = \u03c1\u221eu\u221ex0 \u00b5\u221e ; \u03b40 = x0\u221a Re0 .\nUpstream conditions are applied at x = 0. x0 is the positive value used to normalize the x dimension. Based on the value of x0, the Reynolds number is given as Re0. \u03b40 is an estimate of the boundary-layer thickness at x = x0 and is used to scale the results for y and z.

A non-dimensional Damko\u0308hler number Da is created to define a normalized reaction rate of fuel. This number offers a ratio between the chemical rate to the transport rate within the flow.

This study uses a hyperbolic tangent curve in these cases. For example, u\u2217(0,y\u2217) = 12(1+ u\u2212\u221e u\u221e )+ 12(1\u2212 u\u2212\u221e u\u221e ) tanh(y\u2217). For h\u2217 in the reactive case, an inflow with a temperature peak is given to allow ignition. In particular, a Gaussian curve is taken. We take v\u2217 = 0 at x\u2217 = 0 and v\u2217 = 0 at y\u2217 = 0.\nThe free-stream boundary conditions for u\u2217, \u03ba\u2217, h\u2217, and Ym are constant values. Later, \u03ba\u221e and\n\u03ba\u2212\u221e will be considered as functions of x.\nTaking gaseous oxygen at 300 K and 10 bar where \u03c1\u221e = 4.798 kgm3 , \u00b5\u221e = 42.43 \u00b5Ns m2 , and u\u221e = 1 ms , we find x0 = 0.88 mm for Re0 = 100. The estimate of the thickness of the shear layer \u03b40 under these conditions becomes 0.88/ \u221a 100 = 0.088 mm. In the two-dimensional case with no imposed counterflow, the actual shear layer thickness at x = x0 is found to be 0.39 mm, which is of the same order as our estimate; x0 is approximately 2.3 times the shear layer width that occurs at that x-position.\nThe specific heat at constant pressure is taken to be constant throughout the domain and equal to 1309 Jkg K . This value is the average between the expected specific heat at constant pressure of gaseous oxygen (988 Jkg K ) and gaseous propane (1630 J kg K ).

In Fig. 3(c), we see the increasing value of strain rate \u03ba\u2217 as a result of increasing f \u2217. As f \u2217 increases, the flow field is stretched more strongly in the z-direction. Accordingly, the vortex stretching is greater since the same integral of vorticity occurs in a thinner layer.\nOnly u\u2217 is shown in Fig. 4 because the ratio of the free-stream x-component velocities has a very minor effect on the downstream behavior of the other scalar quantities (v\u2217, \u03ba\u2217, h\u2217, YO, YF ) when all else is held constant. The use of u\u221e in the normalization results in a similarity of the behavior for many variables.

However, the scalar gradients and the normal strain rates in the y- and z-directions are not affected significantly.\nFigs. 5(c) through 5(e) reveal that as Pr increases, the mixing layers for the scalar quantities become thinner since thermal conductivity and mass diffusivity decrease and large scalar gradients are regained.

The analytical solution for A\u221e and A\u2212\u221e yielded two solutions (one positive pair and one negative pair); thus, here both cases are examined. In the case where the constants are positive, there is inflow with compressive normal strain rate in the y-direction and outflow with extensional normal strain rate in the z-direction. For this case, Fig. 6(a) shows that the inward y-velocity decreases with x\u2217. If the imposed compressive strain decreases with x\u2217, then so will the rate of inflow in the mixing layer. Fig. 6(b) shows the 1/x\u2217 behavior of \u03ba\u2217 in the free-streams. Clearly, the counterflow strength and its influence decreases here with increasing downstream distance.\nIn Fig. 7(b) for the case with the negative sign, the outer flow has inflow with compressive normal strain rate in the z-direction and outflow with extensional normal strain rate in the y-direction. However, reversal occurs in the interior mixing region. \u03ba\u2217 is negative in the free-streams and positive in the mixing regions, implying that there is inflow in the z-direction in the free-streams and outflow in the z-direction in the mixing region. Nonetheless, the \u22121/x\u2217 behavior of \u03ba\u2217 is clear in the free streams of Fig. 7(b). Fig. 7(a) shows the flow slowing in the y-direction in the free-streams because the magnitude of the imposed extensive strain is decreasing with x\u2217.\nIn comparing the results for the two cases with different signs for the constants, it appears that a tendency towards vortex stretching occurs even when the outer flow (with the negative constant) would favor vortex shrinking or compression. One might question the stability of the case with the negative constant. Stability analysis is left for a future task.\nLet us compare the behaviors far downstream for the cases from the prior subsection and this subsection. Figs. 8(a) and (b) show downstream similarity for u\u2217 and h\u2217 with regard to y\u2217. With an imposed normal strain that is constant along the stream, the shear layer\u2019s growth is stopped, and the need for a new similarity coordinate is eliminated because y\u2217 becomes the similarity variable downstream. Thus, it is clear that, asymptotically with increasing downstream distance, the shear-layer width becomes constant and a quasi-one-dimensional flow results, although three components of velocity are involved. In the incompressible limit, that asymptote for the non-reactive case is exactly Burgers stretched vortex sheet.\nA different observation is shown in Figs. 8(c) and (d) for the case where the imposed normal strain rate varies as the reciprocal of downstream distance. the shear-layer width grows approxi-\nmately with \u221a x\u2217, allowing a similarity coordinate, \u03b7 , as seen in classical shear layer theory."

            "text": "Here, we consider pure propane fuel in the free stream at y =\u2212\u221e and pure oxygen in the free stream at y = \u221e. Upstream, a region of high temperature is provided in the layer. Therefore, we expect mixing of the two reactants in the shear layer, ignition, and establishment of a diffusion flame.\nFig. 9 depicts the base reactive case (Case 6) at several stations in x\u2217 from 0 to 5. The results show that, if the imposed strain is constant with x\u2217, the reacting shear layer asymptotically reaches a constant width with increasing x\u2217. Here, we see an analogy with Burgers stretched vortex sheet with the resulting asymptotic quasi-one-dimensional flow and albeit that three velocity\ncomponents exist.\nFig. 9(c) shows an increase in peak temperature followed by a converging decrease with increasing downstream distance. The flame moves in the positive y-direction, towards the oxygenrich, higher-speed stream. This temperature peak causes a local decrease in density, which increases the outflow velocity in the z-direction as seen in Fig. 9(d). That is, the flow experiences a greater extensional strain in the z-direction near the flame. Where the density has decreased, the increased w\u2217-component of velocity maintains the imposed counterflow mass flux. Note that there is no increase of mass flux in the x-direction. The y-velocity above and below this region is locally increased near the reaction zone in order to maintain the mass flux at a lower density value, as seen in Fig. 9(b). Fig. 9(f) shows that the reaction rate of fuel decreases substantially downstream while the reaction zone shifts towards the oxygen-rich stream. The difference of magnitude indicates that a decreasing burning rate is required with downstream distance. The mixing-layer thickness varies to accommodate the reduced heat flux from the flame.\nFig. 10 compares the effects of two-dimensional flow ( f \u2217 = 0) to three-dimensional flow ( f \u2217 6= 0) for the reactive case. Fig. 10(d) shows that, in the two-dimensional case, the flame grows to be much wider and hotter than what was initialized upstream. When counterflow is imposed, the flame is constricted to smaller widths. This compression increases temperature gradients in the y-direction, resulting in faster heat transfer from the reaction zone. A sufficient amount of counterflow ( f \u2217 = 2) will extinguish the flame, altogether. Residence time is essentially the reciprocal of strain rate. Although the flame with counterflow is much smaller and cooler than without, Fig. 10(f) shows that the magnitude of reaction rate between the ( f \u2217 = 0) and ( f \u2217 = 1) cases are very similar. The difference is that the absence of counterflow allows the reaction zone to drift to a greater y-value, towards the oxygen stream. Fig. 11(f) shows that the reaction zone will still drift towards the oxygen stream, even if the oxygen stream is slower than the fuel stream.\nFor this reacting case as well as the prior non-reactive case, the ratio of the free-stream xcomponent velocities has a very minor effect on the downstream behavior of the scalar quantities when all else is held constant. A slight increase in burning rate is observed in Fig. 12(f) when the difference in speed between the two streams is lessened. As the velocity of the slower stream is increased, the velocity throughout the layer increases and less burning occurs near the high-speed stream as shown in Fig. 12(f). Nevertheless, mass diffusion brings the fuel to a region of larger reaction rate.\nFigs. 13(c) through 13(e) reveal that as Pr increases, the mixing layers for the scalar quantities\nbecome thinner for the same reasons discussed in the non-reactive case. In Fig. 13(f), the reaction zone does not drift as far in the positive y-direction with increased Prandtl number.\nFig. 14 compares the reactive Cases 6 and 10b to the non-reactive Case 10a. The effects of chemical reaction discussed for Case 6 in Fig. 9 are lessened with a decreased Damko\u0308hler number in Case 10b. When no reaction occurs, the mixing layer for the scalar quantities remains centered at y\u2217 = 0 rather than drifting towards the oxygen-rich stream."

This multi-flame Case 12 is achieved by changing the ambient mass fraction of oxidizer in the fast stream from 1 to 11/12 with propane added in the fast stream. The ambient mass fraction of fuel in the slow stream is decreased from 1 to 23 with oxygen added. Fig. 15(f) clearly shows multiple flames forming a steady structure far downstream.\nIn addition to the diffusion flame, a premixed fuel-lean flame is clearly visible in the temperature profiles of Fig. 15(c) as a downward concavity on the positive y-side of the diffusion flame. The premixed fuel-rich flame is not obvious in Fig. 15(c), but Fig. 15(f) shows that a fuel-rich premixed reaction is occuring, albeit at a slower rate than the diffusion and fuel-lean premixed flames. Consistent with previous findings,29\u201331 the premixed flames depend on heat flux from the stronger diffusion flame. At the particular Damko\u0308hler number, a premixed flame would not survive independently."

            "text": "A fundamental problem for configurations commonly found with turbulent mixing and combustion has been addressed. Specifically, mixing and reaction in a shear layer with vortex stretching has been examined analytically. The downstream asymptotes yield reduced-order behavior which can be helpful in developing flamelet models for turbulent combustion.\nA constantly imposed counterflow has significant effects on the width of a shear layer downstream. Rather than growing as the square root of downstream distance, as found in twodimensional shear considerations, the shear-layer width will reach a constant width when counterflow is imposed with constant strain rate at all streamwise positions. Far downstream, similarity is achieved as all flow variables, including three velocity components, exhibit one-dimensional behavior varying only with y\u2217 across the shear layer. When this counterflow varies as 1/x\u2217, similarity is still observed with \u03b7 , which agrees with classical shear-layer theory.\nWhen chemical reactions are introduced, downstream similarity with y\u2217 is still observed for constant strain rate imposed along the layer. For sufficient y-direction compression, a flame will extinguish downstream. Here, outward, spanwise flow decreases the residence time of combustion reactants and the thinner mixing layer results in faster heat transfer. Likewise, there is a range\nof imposed strain rate where a flame does not extinguish and maintains its form similarly downstream. Furthermore, multi-flame structures can become similar downstream, depending only on the y-position.\nFuture studies might use more rigorous multi-step chemical-reaction models. Gasses might be modeled as real for a high-pressure domain. Rather than selecting the linear behavior of the flow in the z-direction, a three-dimensional numerical solution might be developed, testing for\nhigher-order effects for the spanwise flow.\nThe asymptotic downstream quasi-one-dimensional behavior with three meaningful velocity components offers interesting possibilities for future computational and experimental research. This fully developed downstream behavior retains the major features of the flow: shear and vorticity, mixing, applied strain and counterflow, and three velocity components. Researchers often seek to examine new concepts in configurations that include key physics but reduce the dimensionality of the problem. Here, we have qualitative similarity to the fully developed Poiseuille channel flow where only one-dimension is needed to describe variation in the flow field. However, in this case, it retains three meaningful velocity components and is better suited for studies where heat and mass transport are important."
