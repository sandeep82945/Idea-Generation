Notably, the photocatalytic technology based on semiconductor materials provides us with a new way of thinking in energy utilization and environmental governance.\nThere are many excellent semiconductors in the literature dealing with the photocatalytic performance, especially for transition metal oxides. Among them, due to its excellent performance, V2O5 as a highly ordered two-dimensional layered oxide2 has aroused great interest for a variety of important applications, such as lithium batteries, medicine, and nonferrous metal processing. It was found that V2O5 has a narrow band gap (2.2 eV), requires little energy, and shows superior catalytic activity in partial oxidation.3\u20137 The crystal structure and band structure of V2O5 are shown in Fig. 1.

Initial research studies were performed on V2O5 photocatalytic raw material mainly extracted from vanadium ore directly, but its photocatalytic performance was low. With the continuous development of nanoscience and preparation technology, researchers worldwide are actively exploring to obtain V2O5 materials by means of hydrothermal/ solvothermal method, sol\u2013gel method, electrodeposition, and high-temperature calcination to study the photocatalytic degradation and other properties of V2O5. For example, owerlike V2O5 microspheres with a diameter of \u223c3 mm were synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method using ammonium metavanadate as a vanadium source, and the as-prepared V2O5 microspheres had a large surface area.8 Song et al. developed mesoporous V2O5 nanosheets by a simple hydrothermal method and subsequent instantaneous heating and calcination.9 The V2O5 nanosheets had a unique mesoporous nanostructure containing oxygen vacancies. A novel hierarchical starsh-like vanadium oxide was also synthesized by a direct hydrothermal method using a functional V2O5 sol as a vanadium source. Results demonstrated that the V2O5 material was composed of single crystals of a metastable VO2 (B) phase, which grew along the (110) plane, and four oblique sheets, which grew on the anks of the (110) plane.10 Then, the starshlike structure could be obtained aer phase transition to the orthorhombic V2O5 phase while sintering at 350 \u00b0C.

Furthermore, the excessive temperature was more likely to collapse a-V2O5 structures, which inevitably introduced a lot of defects. An interesting approach was described by Wahab et al. wherein a novel black V2O5 material was synthesized by a controllable and environmentally friendly physicochemical reduction method using NH4VO3 in an alumina crucible with heating at 550 \u00b0C. Furthermore, DFT analysis results revealed that tuning a high degree of surface oxygen vacancies considerably promoted the visible light photoactivity of practically inactive pristine V2O5.13\nAs a transition metal oxide of high oxidation state, V2O5 has quite a few advantages of narrow band gap, high oxygen density, high decomposition temperature, high temperature resistance, low cost, good chemical and optical stability. It shows much potential to be an excellent choice of photocatalyst.14\u201316"

            "text": "In terms of semiconductors, all valence electrons reside in the valence band. The band with higher energy than the valence band is the conduction band, while the gap between the valence band and the conduction band is called the forbidden band. Thus, the photocatalytic oxidation process is simply described as electrons in the valence band being excited by light and then jumping to the conduction band to form electron\u2013hole pairs, which trigger a series of other reactions.\nThe photocatalytic reaction process of V2O5 mainly includes three basic steps: rstly, when light with energy greater than the band gap width (Eg) is used to irradiate the photocatalyst, the electrons in the valence band of the photocatalyst are excited and jump over the band gap into the conduction band, generating electron e\u2212 in the conduction band and leaving positive hole h+ in the valence band; secondly, the photogenerated hole h+ with strong oxidizing property and the photogenerated\n22946 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 22945\u201322957\nelectron e\u2212 with strong reducing property combine to form a redox system; nally, when the photogenerated electron\u2013hole migrates to the surface, e\u2212 can reduce the electron acceptor adsorbed on the catalyst surface, while h+ can combine with the electron donor adsorbed on the catalyst surface to oxidize the substances.\nThe specic principle of the photocatalytic reaction of V2O5 is as follows:\ne\u2212 + O2 / cO2 \u2212 (1)\ne\u2212 + R / R\u2212 (2)\nh+ + H2O / cOH + H + (3)\nh+ + OH\u2212 / cOH (4)\nh+ + R / R+ (5)\ncO2 \u2212 + H+ / cHO2 (6)\ncO2 \u2212 + H2O / cOOH + OH \u2212 (7)\n2cOOH / O2 + H2O2 (8)\nH2O2 + e \u2212 / cOH + OH\u2212 (9)\n2cHO2 / O2 + H2O2 (10)\nH2O2 + cO2 \u2212 / cOH + OH\u2212 + O2 (11)\nH2O2 + hv / cOH (12)\nR (R\u2212, R+) + cOH / CO2 + H2O (13)\nHowever, the narrow band gap of V2O5 makes it easier for the photogenerated electrons and holes to recombine in the excited state, and the stored energy is instantly consumed due to carrier recombination.

The recombination process can be inhibited to a certain extent by generating appropriate defects in the catalyst or introducing appropriate impurity ions as electron\u2013hole trapping agents. Studies have shown that Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Pt, Cr, V, Ru, Y and other metal ions doped into the semiconductor lattice can change the phase transition temperature, and then affect the photocatalytic activity.\nThe ideal doping is a metal ion with an ionic radius close to the V5+ radius so that the doped metal ions can effectively enter the V2O5 lattice (Fig. 2). By doping metal ions into the V2O5 lattice, new impurity levels can be introduced to broaden the response range of V2O5 to sunlight and effectively inhibit the rapid recombination of charge carriers in V2O5 materials. For example, Fe3+ has a similar radius to V5+ and easily enters the V2O5 lattice.17 The transition metal ions Cu-doped V2O5 nanosheets were investigated for their photocatalytic efficiency using organic dye (methyl blue (MB) and rhodamine B (RhB)) under light illumination.18 The results (Fig. 3) showed that Cu\ntocatalytic activity, (d and e) photocatalytic degradation of MB, (f and g) sion from [Elsevier], copyright [2023]).\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 22945\u201322957 | 22947\nFig. 4 (a\u2013d) SEM of V2O5 and Ti-doped V2O5, (e\u2013g) photocatalytic degradation of MB (reproduced from ref. 19 with permission from [Elsevier], copyright [2022]).\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

However, the radius of Cu2+ differs greatly from that of V5+, so the photocatalytic efficiency cannot be improved signicantly by incorporation of metallic Cu. Neelima et al. investigated the visible-light-induced photocatalytic activity of V2O5 nanostructures doped with various amounts of Ti (Fig. 4). The radius of Ti4+ was close to that of V5+. It demonstrated that the Ti4+ introduced into the V2O5 lattice formed trap states within the forbidden gap. The Ti-doped V2O5 nanostructure exhibited a lower recombination rate than pure V2O5 and enhanced the photocatalytic activity.19 The\nFig. 5 (a\u2013d) Photocatalytic degradation of MB, (e) schematic represen activity (reproduced from ref. 21 with permission from [Elsevier], copyrig\n22948 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 22945\u201322957\nimprovement of the photocatalytic efficiency of Ti-doped V2O5 was higher than that of Cu-doped V2O5.\nThe choice of doped metal ions is an important factor. Suvijak et al. studied the effect of multiple metal ion doping on photocatalysis, such as Nb, La, Y, and Zr. They found that V2O5 modication by Nb or La dopants, which had the extra valence cations or larger ionic radius, suppressed the oxygen vacancies formation, leading to lower activity.20 Meanwhile, Y and Zr exhibited good capability of H2S removal, and the amount of surface oxygen and H2S conversion of the Y-doped V2O5 were more than that of the Zr-doped V2O5.\nThe concentration of metal ions is another important factor affecting the photocatalytic performance.

However, the high concentration of metal ions located at the lattice site would become the carrier recombination center, which inhibited the photocatalytic activity. In addition, if the doped metal ion concentration was too high, it was easier to form a thick layer of space charge on the surface, and to a certain extent, hinder the photon absorption, thus reducing the catalytic activity. For example, a series of Gd-doped V2O5 (1 wt%, 3 wt%, 5 wt% and 10 wt%) photocatalysts had been prepared through a facile wet chemical approach, as shown in Fig. 5. The results demonstrated that 5 wt% Gd\u2013V2O5 nanorod was in favor of MB photodegradation, and this optimum concentration probably occurred due to the quantum tunneling effect.21 Shahid et al. reported on Na-doped V2O5 nanorods for visible light-irradiated photocatalytic performance for the degradation of rhodamine dye, as shown in Fig. 6, and found that 5 wt% Na-doped V2O5 exhibited the maximum degradation with 88.9% degradation rate.22 Basu et al. found that the 2 mol% Nb-doped V2O5 nanorods achieved the maximum photocatalytic degradation of complex organic caffeine and removed 91% in 2 hours (Fig. 7).23\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

One theory states that the non-metallic elements enter the crystal lattice of the V2O5 photocatalyst.

The photocatalytic degradation of methyl blue was measured in approximately 30 min in water samples under xenon light.24 Because of the smaller ionic radius of B3+ compared to that of V5+, the presence of boron on the surface, grain boundaries or V2O5 matrix could easily be integrated into the V2O5 skeleton without changing the initial morphology of V2O5.

By combining the V2O5 semiconductor with materials with different bandgap widths, the composite semiconductors were prepared, so as to effectively improve the utilization efficiency of visible light of the V2O5 composite materials (Fig. 10). Different oxide or sulde semiconductors have different effects on the photocatalytic performance of\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\ncomposites. According to literature reports, the optimal band gap of the actual photocatalyst is about 1.8 eV. Therefore, the reasonable selection of composite is very important to improve the photocatalytic performance of V2O5.\nThe interfacial transfer rate of electrons and holes is much slower than that of the capture or recombination process of photogenerated charge. If the interfacial transfer rate of electrons and holes can be accelerated to reduce the accumulation of photogenerated charge in the semiconductor, the recombination probability of photogenerated electrons and holes can also be reduced and the efficiency of photocatalytic oxidation can be improved. The band gap of the V2O5 semiconductor is relatively narrow, and the photogenerated electrons and holes generated in the photocatalytic reaction are easy to recombine. However, the band structure and band gap width of different conductors are different. Therefore, the appropriate semiconductor can be selected to combine with V2O5. The characteristics of the band structure of the two semiconductors can be used to accelerate the interface transfer rate of electrons and holes, and improve the photocatalytic efficiency.\nTypically, when sunlight irradiates the V2O5\u2013TiO2 composites, the electrons in the V2O5 valence band are rst excited and jump to the conduction band, where e\u2212 is produced and h+ is le in the valence band. TiO2 is then activated to perform the same photogeneration carrier process inside the semiconductor. Due to the difference in their potential, h+ in the V2O5 valence band ows to the TiO2 valence band, while e\n\u2212 in the TiO2 conduction band ows to the V2O5 conduction band. Thus, photogenerated electrons and holes can be effectively separated, and the accumulation of photogenerated charges in semiconductor can be reduced.

            "text": "The Fermi energy levels between noble metals and semiconductors are signicantly different. When noble metals are deposited on the surface of semiconductors, photogenerated electrons will migrate from the semiconductors to the noble metals. Once the Fermi energy levels of the two arematched, the noble metals capture a large amount of negative charge, while the semiconductors obtain the corresponding positive charge, leading to the band bending and formation of the Schottky barrier, which can effectively prevent carrier recombination and improve the yield of photogenerated electrons (Fig. 13). Studies have shown that the photocatalytic activity of the composite materials modied by gold (Au), silver (Ag), platinum (Pt) and other noble metals is better than that of the photocatalytic materials prepared by pure semiconductor oxides. Adding an appropriate amount of noble metals can promote efficient electron\u2013hole separation,33 thus improving the photocatalytic effect. Recently, considerable research efforts have been devoted to Au or Pt nanostructures for modication of photocatalytic materials due to the excellent stability and signicant photocatalytic performance. For example, in Fig. 14, Audecorated V2O5 nanorods were prepared through a one-step template-free hydrothermal method by Kumar's group. These nanorods exhibited a higher degradation of R6G dye when compared to pure V2O5.34 It was found that superoxide radicals\n6G, (h) mechanism of Au-decorated V2O5 nanorods (reproduced from\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 22945\u201322957 | 22953\nFig. 15 (a\u2013g) Characterization, photocatalytic degradation and mechanism of Pt-decorated V2O5 nanorods (reproduced from ref. 35 with permission from [Elsevier], copyright [2020]).

Kumar et al. conrmed that Pt-decorated V2O5 nanorods also showed enhanced photocatalytic degradation of R6G dye under visible light irradiation, and the Pt NPs-assisted V2O5 increased the light response of the photocatalyst in the visible region with a maximum of 94% degradation with 1 wt% Pt,35 as shown in Fig. 15. Seralathan et al. also reported on the Pt/V2O5 nanocomposites for the efficient photocatalytic degradation of oxytetracycline.36\nHowever, the expensive price and complex preparation process of gold or platinum nanomaterials limited their practical application and large-scale promotion. In contrast, Ag is lower priced than Au or Pt, and may have more potential for commercialization. As can be seen in Fig. 16, the Ag/V2O5 nanocatalyst prepared by Sheshtawy et al. exhibited unique catalytic, photocatalytic and post-oxidation/reduction ability for the removal of organic, p-nitrophenol, methylene blue and inorganic water pollutants.37 On the one hand, by depositing Ag nanoparticles on the surface of V2O5, the recombination of\n22954 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 22945\u201322957\nphotogenerated electrons and holes was effectively inhibited by changing the electron energy level structure of the system. On the other hand, by depositing Ag nanoparticles on the surface of V2O5, the surface properties of V2O5 were changed and the photon yield of photocatalysis was improved. Moreover, the local surface plasmon resonance effect of Ag nanoparticles was used to enhance the visible light absorption capacity of the composites, and nally improved the photocatalytic performance of V2O5 system."

The use of special materials, such as MXene, graphene, gC3N4, black phosphorus, and others, was also used to overcome its own defects of V2O5. The Ti3C2 MXene/NiFe2O4/V2O5 ternary composites were constructed by Lam and Zeng et al., which exhibited improved photoactivity for the decomposition of RhB, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus.39\nApplication of V2O5 photocatalytic materials is not limited to the photodegradation of dyes. It is of great signicance to explore the wide range of applications where V2O5 photocatalytic materials have been utilized, including pollutant degradation,40 water splitting,41,42 CO2 reduction,43\u201345 and organic synthesis,46\u201348 and others.\nA variety of characterization techniques for V2O5 photocatalytic materials are benecial to understanding the nature of V2O5 and developing the photocatalysts. For example, the crystal growth of V2O5 nanopowders prepared by sol\u2013gel and hydrothermal methods was investigated by XRD, and further used with Scherrer's formula to obtain the particle size of V2O5 nanopowders.\nD \u00bc kl b cos q\n(15)\nThe average particle size of V2O5 nanopowders prepared by sol\u2013gel method was calculated to be 290 nm, while the average particle size for hydrothermally prepared V2O5 nanopowders was 242 nm.49 Of course, in the sol\u2013gel method, visual\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nagglomeration of V2O5 particles was also found by SEM, which was not conducive to photocatalytic activity. Dizaji et al. also used XRD and SEM to study the graphene oxide-V2O5 nanocomposite prepared by a simple hydrothermal method.50 It was observed that the V2O5 crystalline phase began to appear when the powder was treated at 300 \u00b0C. Meanwhile, it presented a higher degree of crystallinity upon increase of the heattreatment temperature to 400 and 500 \u00b0C, along with an increase of grain size, according to the Scherrer's equation. With the increase of calcination temperature, most of the V2O5 nanorods were converted to nanosheets, as seen from the SEM measurements. The specimen calcined at 400 \u00b0C was selected as the best one for preparing the nanocomposite in this work,50 which was conrmed by further photocatalytic properties. Sajid et al. also measured BET and obtained a nitrogen adsorption\u2013 desorption curve because the photocatalytic action was fundamentally related to the adsorption\u2013degradation.49 The results indicated that the enhanced surface area and larger pore size of V2O5 by hydrothermal method provided new active sites for the facile transfer of the charge carrier and efficient adsorption of the reactant molecules,49 leading to superior photocatalytic activity with 99.1% and 82% degradation in 180 min for Congo Red and Methyl Orange, respectively. The UV-visible analysis revealed an energy band gap of 2.3 eV, which demonstrated that V2O5 possessed a great affinity for visible light absorption, and helped us understand the photocatalytic mechanism better.49\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 22945\u201322957 | 22955\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

As a result, the well-distributed rGO nanosheets and V2O5 nanorods showed a photodegradation efficiency of 85% in 255 min for the decolorization of the methylene blue dye."

            "text": "The modied vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) catalysts can be used for the selective and effective photocatalytic degradation of dyes, organic pollutants, poisonous gas and other substances. The modied V2O5 theoretically has excellent photocatalytic performance. However, V2O5 catalysts that are sufficiently stable and efficient for practical use have not yet been realized, and there are still some limitations in commercial application. With regard to doping, whether for metallic ion doping or nonmetallic ion doping, it is inevitably subject to the inuence of the type and concentration of doping ions. This brings difficulty in the preparation and regulation of structure, in order to introduce them into the V2O5 lattice and form the stable structure. Concerning semiconductor recombination, there is an urgent need for a perfect match between the valence and conduction potentials of the two semiconductors to form an effective structure. It is not easy for an appropriate choice of semiconductors to recombine with V2O5. Moreover, some semiconductors, despite their outstanding photocatalytic activity, are toxic and not environmentally friendly, such as CdS and WO3. Noble metal deposition has been proved to be a kind of efficient and simple means to improve the photocatalytic performance, but the high cost of noble metals is not friendly to the commercial photocatalyst. These special materials do not exhibit stable performance, and their role in the photocatalytic mechanism is not clear. Moreover, the unmarketable MXene, graphene and black phosphorus materials greatly increase the cost of research and development. Therefore, the research direction of V2O5 photocatalytic materials in the future should improve the photocatalytic efficiency, as well as reduce the cost.\nOn the one hand, two or more modication methods can be combined to promote the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, improve the electron transfer rate, and thus enhance the photocatalytic efficiency. The combination of cheap semiconductors or metallic/non-metallic elements with noble metals may increase the photocatalytic activity of V2O5. On the premise of the effective improvement of the photocatalytic performance, it can also decrease the use of expensive noble metals.\nOn the other hand, during the process of modifying V2O5 photocatalytic materials in various ways, the reasonable design of composites needs further exploration and research, such as\n22956 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 22945\u201322957\nhow to control the morphology and structure, as well as how to implement interface regulation.\nFinally, V2O5 and V2O5-based composites are currently being extensively studied for the photodegradation of dyes, and have shown a relatively obvious photocatalytic effect. The following work should expand its application range, such as water splitting, organic synthesis, CO2 reduction, so as to be truly applied in practice."
