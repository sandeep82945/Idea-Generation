Hume1, \u2020\n1National Institute of Standards and Technology, Boulder, CO 2HEP Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, IL\n3Key Laboratory of Atomic Frequency Standards, Innovation Academy for Precision Measurement Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China\n4Department of Physics, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO (Dated: July 26, 2022)\nIn quantum logic spectroscopy (QLS), one species of trapped ion is used as a sensor to detect the state of an otherwise inaccessible ion species. This extends precision measurements to a broader class of atomic and molecular systems for applications like atomic clocks and tests of fundamental physics. Here, we develop a new technique based on a Schro\u0308dinger cat interferometer to address the problem of scaling QLS to larger ion numbers. We demonstrate the basic features of this method using various combinations of 25Mg+ logic ions and 27Al+ spectroscopy ions. We observe higher detection efficiency by increasing the number of 25Mg+ ions. Applied to multiple 27Al+, this method will improve the stability of high-accuracy optical clocks and could enable Heisenberg-limited QLS.\nExperiments on quantum systems face a common challenge of state detection, which requires amplifying tiny, quantum signals above the background noise. In the case of atomic systems, including trapped ions, the typical approach to state detection is to observe photons scattered from a particular quantum state [1]. This approach works well on a limited number of atomic species that have a suitable internal structure; however, numerous other atomic species are compelling targets for specific applications but do not have suitable transitions for direct state detection. For example, some species of molecular ions [2, 3], highly-charged ions [4], and even antimatter particles [5], offer unique opportunities for testing fundamental physics [6].\nQuantum logic spectroscopy (QLS) enables state detection of otherwise inaccessible ions by introducing a co-trapped logic ion (LI). The internal state of the spectroscopy ion (SI) is transferred via a shared mode of motion to the LI where it can be detected via photon scattering. The first demonstration of QLS was with 27Al+ [7, 8], which now serves as a frequency reference in atomic clocks [9\u201312]. Variations on the QLS technique have been developed with several aims: to demonstrate Hz-level precision spectroscopy for atomic clocks [9\u201312], to perform correlation spectroscopy [13], to work far offresonance from an optical transition [2, 14], or to operate in thermal motion [15, 16]. So far QLS has only been performed on up to two SIs [13] and the issue of scaling QLS techniques to larger ion numbers [17] is an open experimental question.\nIn this paper, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a new method of QLS that can be scaled to larger ion numbers. Our protocol employs multiple LIs as independent sensors to detect a state-dependent driving force applied to the co-trapped SIs. This technique does not require ground state cooling or individual ion addressing, both of which become more difficult with larger ion\nensembles [18, 19]. We apply the technique experimentally to ensembles of up to 3 LIs and 3 SIs. By scaling the number of LIs, we show that technical noise in the detection process can be suppressed.\nOur protocol relies on a Schro\u0308dinger cat state [20] of the LIs, which acts as an interferometric sensor for the state of the SIs (see Fig. 1). Several schemes have been explored to create the Schro\u0308dinger cat states [20\u201323], including the \u03c3\u0302\u03c6-type interaction [22, 24] employed here. To produce this, a bichromatic laser field is applied to the LIs with frequency components near resonance with the motional sidebands at frequencies \u03c90\u00b1\u03c9M , where \u03c90 is the qubit resonance frequency and \u03c9M is the frequency of a shared motional mode. In the Lamb-Dicke limit, the dynamics of a single LI driven by the laser are described by the interaction Hamiltonian [25],\nH\u0302 = ~\u03b7\u21260\n2 \u03c3\u0302\u03c6(a\u0302e\ni\u03c6M + a\u0302\u2020e\u2212i\u03c6M ), (1)\nwhere 2\u03c0~ is Planck\u2019s constant, \u21260 is the Rabi frequency, and \u03b7 is the Lamb-Dicke parameter, describing the coupling strength between the laser field and the motional mode of the ions. We use a rotated Pauli spin operator \u03c3\u0302\u03c6 = e\n\u2212i\u03c6S \u03c3\u0302+ + ei\u03c6S \u03c3\u0302\u2212 where \u03c3\u0302\u00b1, a\u0302, and a\u0302\u2020 are ladder operators of the spin mode and the motional mode, respectively. The phases of the red (\u03c6r) and blue (\u03c6b) components of the laser field control the spin phase, \u03c6S = (\u03c6b + \u03c6r)/2, and the motional phase, \u03c6M = (\u03c6b \u2212 \u03c6r)/2.\nIn the simplest case, consider a single LI prepared in a superposition state: |\u03c8\u3009L = |\u2193\u3009L = (|\u2192\u3009L + |\u2190\u3009L)/ \u221a 2, where |\u2191\u3009L and |\u2193\u3009L are the energy eigenstates of the LI and |\u2190\u3009L and |\u2192\u3009L are the eigenstates of \u03c3\u0302\u03c6. Applying the bichromatic laser field realizes a spin-dependent displacement on the LI (LI-SDD): U\u0302(t) = D\u0302(+\u03b1)|\u2192\u3009L\u3008\u2192|L + D\u0302(\u2212\u03b1)|\u2190\u3009L\u3008\u2190|L, where D is the motional phase space displacement am-\nar X\niv :2\n20 7.\n11 76\n8v 1\n[ ph\nys ic\ns. at\nom -p\nh] 2\n4 Ju\nl 2 02\n2\n2\nplitude and \u03b1(t) = \u2212i\u03b7\u21260te\u2212i\u03c6M /2. This is analogous to the first \u201cbeam splitter\u201d of an interferometer, creating the Schro\u0308dinger cat state shown in Fig. 1(c). Likewise, the second beam splitter in the interferometer (LISDD\u22121) can be produced by applying the same laser pulse, but shifting \u03c6M by \u03c0. If there is no additional displacement during the interferometer, this operation recombines the two motional components, recovering the initial state of the LI. However, displacements that occur between the two interferometer pulses generally produce a geometric phase, which can be detected in the final state of the LI. Here, we consider a state-dependent displacement (SI-SDD) produced by another bichromatic laser field applied to a SI coupled to the LI through their collective motion at frequency \u03c9M . For example, if the SI is prepared in the state: |\u03c8\u3009S = (|\u2193\u3009S + |\u2191\u3009S)/ \u221a 2 = |\u2192\u3009S it undergoes a displacement D\u0302(\u03b2) (marked as SISDD in Fig. 1(d)), which produces a geometric phase \u03b8 = 2\u03b1\u03b2 sin\u03c6M , rotating the state of the LI by e\n\u22122i\u03b8\u03c3\u0302\u03c6 . Measurement of the LI population P\u2193,L after the second beamsplitter gives:\nP\u2193,L = [1 + cos(4\u03b1\u03b2 sin\u03c6M )]/2. (2)\nThe parameter \u03b2 contains information about the interaction between the SI and the SI-SDD beams, which is detected interferometrically by the LI. We use this in two distinct ways. First, we perform spectroscopy directly on the |\u2193\u3009S \u2194 |\u2191\u3009S transition, where the phase, duration and detuing of the SI-SDD pulse itself modulates \u03b2 (Fig. 2). Second, we detect \u201cclock\u201d transitions from |\u2193\u3009S to the long-lived clock state (|c\u3009S) using the fact that only the ions in state |\u2193\u3009S interact with the SI-SDD pulse. This allows for spectroscopy on a narrow clock transition and is analogous to the electron-shelving technique used in conventional fluorescence measurements (Fig. 3).\nBoth protocols can be scaled to NL LIs and NS SIs. Assuming that all ions have nearly equal mode amplitudes and feel equal driving forces, all the LIs can be treated as independent sensors. The signal observed by the LIs increases linearly with NL [26]. In scaling NS , the\n3 force experienced by the ions during the SI-SDD pulse increases linearly with the number SIs in the state |\u2193\u3009S . By appropriate choice of parameters \u03b1 and \u03c6M this provides a means to count the number of ions remaining in |\u2193\u3009S after a clock pulse on multiple SIs.\nWe demonstrate this interferometer using 25Mg+ as the LI and 27Al+ as the SI confined in a linear Paul trap [12, 27]. The trap frequencies are approximately (\u03c9x, \u03c9y, \u03c9z) = 2\u03c0 \u00d7 (6.7, 6.3, 2.5) MHz for a single 25Mg+. The qubit states of the 25Mg+ ions are encoded in |\u2193\u3009L \u2261 |2S1/2, F = 3,mF = \u22123\u3009 and |\u2191\u3009L \u2261 |2S1/2, F = 2,mF = \u22122\u3009. Doppler cooling and state detection of 25Mg+ relies on resonance fluorescence from the |\u2193\u3009L \u2194 |2P3/2, F = 4,mF = \u22124\u3009 cycling transition driven by a circularly-polarized 280.4 nm laser beam.\nA pair of perpendicular 279.6 nm laser beams, referred to here as red Raman (RR) and blue Raman (BR) respectively, with wavevector difference \u2206k along the trap z-axis are used to generate Raman sideband pulses [27], and the LI-SDD. The BR beam consists of two frequency components, which are separated by 2\u03c9M . For the\n27Al+ ions, the qubit states are encoded in |\u2193\u3009S \u2261 |1S0,mF = \u22125/2\u3009 and |\u2191\u3009S \u2261 |3P1,mF = \u22127/2\u3009. A circular-polarized, bichromatic 266.9 nm beam line is applied at a 45\u25e6 angle with the trap z-axis for the qubit manipulation and the SI-SDD. Both the 266.9 nm and the 279.6 nm laser beams are intensity stabilized using photodiodes before entering the trap to generate carrier Rabi rates of approximately 300 kHz. When trapping one 25Mg+ ion and one 27Al+ ion, the Lamb-Dicke parameters of the 2.5-MHz center-of-mass (COM) mode along the z-axis are \u03b7L = 0.18 for the LI and \u03b7S = 0.10 for the SI, respectively. We use this mode to drive both the LI-SDD and the SI-SDD as the mode amplitudes z0 are nearly the same for ions in different positions. In addition, the motional phases of both SDDs need to be equal for all the ions and controllable between species, which can be satisfied using a bichromatic laser field [26]. When scaling to multiple number of ions, those Lamb-Dicke parameters decrease since the ground-state wavefunction size z0 \u221d (M\u03c9M )\u22121/2, where M is the total mass of the ion chain.\nWe first prepare a pair of 25Mg+ and 27Al+ to demonstrate features of the interferometer. The 25Mg+ ion is optically pumped to the |\u2193\u3009L state, while the 27Al+ ion is rotated to |\u2192\u3009S = (|\u2193\u3009S + |\u2191\u3009S)/2 using a \u03c0/2-carrier pulse. In order to control the geometric phase enclosed in the interferometer, it is necessary to maintain the relative phases between the LI-SDD on the 25Mg+ ions and SI-SDD on the 27Al+ ions. To accomplish this, we produce the red and blue tones for the two bichromatic laser beams by mixing radio-frequency signals that are used to drive two acousto-optic modulators (AOMs) from a single source [26]. The long-term phase coherence can be observed between these two pairs of laser beams by scanning their relative phase \u03c6M (Fig. 2(a)). In this ex-\n4 tion (\u03b4s) is scanned over a range of 300 kHz. Additional SBC pulses are applied for all the cases to suppress the coupling outiside the Lamb-Dicke regime. We note that when \u03b4s 6= 0, the 27Al+ ions and the collective motion undergo a complicated evolution, resulting in a complex line shape shown in the simulation results [26]. For the case of 6 ions, the ion chain has formed a zig-zag geometry, but we still observe a resonant response in the interferometer, although with reduced contrast.\nNow we introduce the SI clock state (|c\u3009S) encoded in the |3P0,mF = \u22125/2\u3009 state which has a lifetime of approximately 20.6 s [28]. Precision measurement of the |\u2193\u3009S \u2194 |c\u3009S transition is the basis for Al+ optical clocks. We use a single 27Al+ ion and vary the number of 25Mg+ ions from 1 to 3. The 27Al+ ion is driven periodically by a weak 267.4 nm laser that is close to resonance with the clock transition resulting in infrequent state changes. These \u201cquantum jumps\u201d are clearly observed (Fig. 3(a)) since the SI-SDD, and hence the fluorescence of the 25Mg+ ions is gated by the state of the 27Al+ ion.\nWe select the number of measurement repetitions via an adaptive Bayesian process [8]. The detection error probability is determined by comparing the results of two consecutive detection sequences (Fig. 3(b)), counting one detection error if they disagree. This assumes that the probability of two consecutive detection errors can be ignored, which is true for small, uncorrelated error probabilities. We expect this to be valid for shorter detection times (the initial slopes in Fig. 3(b)), but errors due to spontaneous decay at longer detection times will violate the assumption of uncorrelated errors [29]. We observe that increasing the number of 25Mg+ ions increases the measurement efficiency. In addition to the improved signal-to-noise ratio, given the same confinement conditions, the Lamb-Dicke parameters are also reduced with more LIs, improving the contrast by suppressing imperfections due to higher-order processes.\nIn Fig. 3(b), we also compare the efficiency of detection at the Doppler limit versus after sideband cooling the zCOM mode to near the motional ground state. Although the single-shot fidelity is lower with only Doppler cooling, the 1.25 ms additional duration of the sideband cooling sequence makes it less efficient.\nWe demonstrate the detection protocol with two 27Al+ and two 25Mg+ ions (NS = NL = 2). We introduce the number states |NS,\u2193\u3009 to represent the number of SIs remaining in state |\u2193\u3009S , where |NS,\u2193\u3009 \u2208 {|0\u3009, |1\u3009, |2\u3009}. In Fig. 4(a), we show expected fluorescence levels for each of these three cases as a function of the SI-SDD duration. Choosing the SI-SDD duration to be t1 = 14 \u00b5s results in an interferometer phase of \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 for the case NS,\u2193 = 2, corresponding to both logic ions flipping from bright to dark. However, for NS,\u2193 = 1 there is a 50 % transition probability for both LIs, and for NS,\u2193 = 0 both LIs remain bright. In Fig. 4(b) we prepare these states\n5 In summary, we have demonstrated a method of performing QLS based on the Schro\u0308dinger cat interferometer that allows for scaling both the number of spectroscopy ions and logic ions. This technique operates with ions in thermal motion and is insensitive to the position of the ions in the array. Technical improvements to the current experiment including higher laser power to address all ions equally and improved background gas pressure will allow this protocol to be scaled to longer ion chains. As shown in the supplemental material [26], the projection noise in a single detection cycle using this protocol depends on the number of logic ions in addition to the number of spectroscopy ions. In the future, this technique could allow quantum logic spectroscopy in even larger ion ensembles, where some of the same capabilities used here have already been demonstrated [31, 32].\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank D.

For the |\u2193\u3009L and |\u2191\u3009L states of the logic ion, we consider equal and opposite forces with amplitudes F\u2193,L = \u2212F\u2191,L \u2261 FL. Similarly, for the spectroscopy system, with states |\u2193\u3009S and |\u2191\u3009S we define F\u2193,S = \u2212F\u2191,S \u2261 FS . For both LI and SI, |\u2193\u3009 and |\u2191\u3009 represent the eigenstates of \u03c3\u0302i Paul operator.\nAt the beginning, the logic ion is prepared in an equal superposition |\u03c8\u3009L = (|\u2193\u3009L + |\u2191\u3009L) / \u221a\n2 while the spectroscopy ion is assumed to be in state |\u2193\u3009S . Application of the state-dependent force F (t) = \u00b1FL cos (\u03c9M t) for time tL results in state-dependent displacements (LI-SDDs) D\u0302(\u03b1) and D\u0302(\u2212\u03b1) for the |\u2191\u3009L and |\u2193\u3009L states, respectively. The displacement amplitude is given by \u03b10 = |\u03b1(tL)| = FLzLtL/2h\u0304, where zL is the extent of the logic ion wavefunction in the ground state. This results in a Schro\u0308dinger cat state,\n|\u03c8\u3009 = 1\u221a 2 (|\u2193\u3009L|+\u03b1\u3009M + |\u2191\u3009L|\u2212\u03b1\u3009M ) |\u2193\u3009S , (1)\nwhere the logic ion state is entangled with the motion. A subsequent state-dependent force F (t) = \u00b1FS cos (\u03c9M t+ \u03c6M ) applied to the spectroscopy ion for time tS results in another state-dependent displacement (SI-SDD) D(\u03b2) at an angle \u03c6M relative to the initial wave-packet separation. Here, equivalently to the logic ion case, we have \u03b20 = |\u03b2(tS)| = FSzStS/2h\u0304, where zS is the extent of the spectroscopy ion wave function in the ground state.\nThe interferometer is finally closed by reversing the original LI-SDD (marked as LI-SDD\u22121) via application of F (t) = \u2213FL cos (\u03c9M t). Note that a phase shift of \u03c0 is introduced. Using D\u0302(\u03b2)D\u0302(\u03b1) = D\u0302(\u03b2 + \u03b1)ei|\u03b1||\u03b2|sin\u03c6M , we can write the state after all three displacements:\n|\u03c8\u3009 = 1\u221a 2\n( e\u22122i\u03b10\u03b20sin\u03c6M |\u2193\u3009L + e2i\u03b10\u03b20sin\u03c6M |\u2191\u3009L ) |\u2193\u3009S |\u03b2\u3009M , (2)\nwhere we can see a relative phase 2\u03b8 = 4\u03b10\u03b20sin\u03c6M has been accumulated in this interferometer between the |\u2193\u3009L and |\u2191\u3009L state.\nWe can map the phase to populations by rotating our spin basis from \u03c3\u0302L,i to another orthogonal basis \u03c3\u0302L,j using |\u2193\u3009L,j \u2192 (|\u2193\u3009L + |\u2191\u3009L)/ \u221a 2 and |\u2191\u3009L,j \u2192 (|\u2193\u3009L \u2212 |\u2191\u3009L)/ \u221a 2. The resulting logic ion state is\n|\u03c8\u3009L = cos(\u03b8)|\u2193\u3009L,j + i sin(\u03b8)|\u2191\u3009L,j (3)\nwhere we can observe state populations,\nP\u2193,L = cos 2(\u03b8) = (1 + cos(2\u03b8))/2,\nP\u2191,L = sin 2(\u03b8) = (1\u2212 cos(2\u03b8))/2.\n(4)\nThis sinusoidal response can be used as a means of state detection for the spectroscopy ion system. Here, we suppose that a separate spectroscopy pulse, before the detection sequence, probes an auxiliary resonance |\u2193\u3009S \u2194 |c\u3009S . To maximize signal-to-noise in detecting the transition |\u2193\u3009S \u2192 |c\u3009S , we can choose parameters \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 such that we get maximum transition probability P\u2191,L = 1 when the spectroscopy ion remains in state |\u2193\u3009S .\nar X\niv :2\n20 7.\n11 76\n8v 1\n[ ph\nys ic\ns. at\nom -p\nh] 2\n4 Ju\nl 2 02\n2\n2 SCALING TO MULTIPLE LOGIC IONS\nWhen applying spin-dependent forces on multiple ions simultaneously, we rely on several simplifying conditions that can be met in our experiment. First, we assume equal force amplitudes on all logic ions in the ion chain. In our case that means that the laser beams used to produce an SDD have nearly equal intensity across the array. Second, we require that all the ions have nearly equal mode amplitudes for the mode of motion addressed. These two conditions together ensure that the characteristic displacement amplitude, |\u03b1|, for each logic ion is equal. Third, we assume that the phase of the force is equal for all the ions. Depending on the method chosen to produce the state-dependent forces, this can be satisfied experimentally to a greater or lesser degree.\nWith these conditions, the displacement amplitude for a particular logic ion state during the opening and closing pulses of the interferometer is given by \u03b1 = (NL,\u2191 \u2212NL,\u2193)\u03b10. Here NL,\u2191 and NL,\u2193 count the number of logic ions in the states |\u2193\u3009L and |\u2191\u3009L respectively. With strictly resonant interactions in terms of the motional frequency and qubit frequency, we show that these conditions result in each logic ion acting as an independent sensor of the displacement applied to the spectroscopy ions.\nWe expand the state of the logic ion system in terms of the collective angular momentum states |JL,mL\u3009 where JL = NL/2 and mL = (NL,\u2191 \u2212NL,\u2193)/2. The initial state of the logic ions can be written as,\n|\u03c8\u3009L = JL\u2211\nmL=\u2212JL cm|JL,mL\u3009. (5)\nThe amplitude is given by [1]\ncm =\n( 2JL\nmL + JL )1/2( 1\u221a 2 )2JL , (6)\nwhere ( N k ) is the binomial coefficient [1]. Each state in the basis |JL,mL\u3009 is displaced by |\u03b1| = 2mL\u03b10 during the opening interferometer pulse and subsequently by |\u03b1| = \u22122mL\u03b10 during the closing interferometer pulse. When thinking about the case of a single spectrosocpy ion, the full interferometer sequence produces the state,\n|\u03c8\u3009 = JL\u2211\nmL=\u2212JL cmLe\n4imL\u03b10\u03b20 sin(\u03c6M )|JL,mL\u3009|\u03b2\u3009M |\u2193\u3009S , (7)\nwhere each term |JL,mL\u3009 traces a unique path in phase space and acquires a geometrical phase of 4imL\u03b10\u03b20 sin(\u03c6M ). Since mL = (NL,\u2191 \u2212 NL,\u2193)/2, each phase factor e4imL\u03b10\u03b20 sin(\u03c6M ) contains NL,\u2191 factors of e2i\u03b10\u03b20 sin(\u03c6M ) and NL,\u2193 factors of e\u22122i\u03b10\u03b20 sin(\u03c6M ). Therefore, at the end of the interferometric sequence the logic ion state can be factorized as,\n|\u03c8\u3009L = [\n1\u221a 2\n( e\u22122i\u03b10\u03b20 sin(\u03c6M )|\u2193\u3009L + e2i\u03b10\u03b20 sin(\u03c6M )|\u2191\u3009L )]\u2297NL . (8)\nEach logic ion thus acts as an independent sensor of the spectroscopy ion displacement amplitude.\nDETECTION EFFICIENCY WITH MULTIPLE SPECTROSCOPY IONS\nIn considering multiple spectroscopy ions we make similar assumptions regarding the phase and amplitude of the state-dependent forces as we did for the logic ions. Namely, the forces are applied in-phase with equal coupling to each ion. The condition that controls the magnitude of the force is the internal state of the spectroscopy ion (i.e., |\u2193\u3009S , |\u2191\u3009S and |c\u3009S with corresponding force amplitudes FS,\u2193 = FS , FS,\u2191 = \u2212FS and FS,a = 0, respectively. Relative to the phase of the initial displacement on the logic ions, the phase of the spectroscopy ion displacement is set to \u03c0/2, such that the ion wavepackets trace out rectangles in phase space.\nA typical spectroscopy sequence consists of three operations: (1) A series of pulses on both the logic ions and the spectroscopy ions to prepare them to a desired initial state. (2) An interrogation pulse (or series of pulses) on the spectroscopy ions to excite the |\u2193\u3009S \u2194 |c\u3009S transition. We assume this operation has no coupling to the ions\u2019 shared motion such that the state of the spectroscopy system at the end of the interrogation operation can be written as |\u03c8\u3009S = (cS,\u2193|\u2193\u3009S + cS,c|c\u3009S)\u2297NS . (3) An interferometric sequence to determine the number of ions NS,\u2193 remaining in\n3 the ground state after the spectroscopy operation. After this operation, any coherence between the states |\u2193\u3009S and |c\u3009S should have no effect on the outcome of the measurement. We are interested only in the populations PS,\u2193 = |cS,\u2193|2 and PS,a = |cS,a|2 = 1\u2212 |cS,\u2193|2. We ensure that this is the case by interacting with the measurement procedure only through the |\u2193\u3009S state which has no coupling to |c\u3009S during this operation.\nAfter the spectroscopy sequence, state detection proceeds through the same interferometer sequence described for a single spectroscopy ion above. In the second step of the interferometer, a resonant force applied to the spectroscopy ions results in displacement D(\u03b2) where \u03b2 = iNS,\u2193\u03b20. The total phase accumulated between logic ion states |\u2193\u3009L and |\u2191\u3009L is proportional to NS,\u2193,\n\u03b8 = 2NS,\u2193\u03b10\u03b20 sin\u03c6M . (9)\nThe choice of 4NS\u03b10\u03b20 sin\u03c6M = \u03c0 bounds the geometric phase to \u03b8 \u2208 [0, \u03c0/2]. If we define the collective spin basis states of the spectroscopy ion system |JS ,mS\u3009 similarly to the case of the logic ions, the full state at the end of the detection sequence can be written as,\n|\u03c8\u3009 = JS\u2211\nmS=\u2212JS cmS (\u03a6)\n[ cos (\u03c0\n4 \u03b8S\n) |\u2193\u3009L + isin (\u03c0 4 \u03b8S ) |\u2191\u3009L ]\u2297NL |(JS \u2212mS)\u03b20\u3009M |JS ,mS\u3009, (10)\nwhere \u03b8S = 2(JS \u2212mS)/JS , cmS (\u03a6) is the amplitude of the state and |JS ,mS\u3009 as a function of the atom-laser phase at the end of a Ramsey sequence \u03a6 = (\u03c9L \u2212 \u03c9A)TR. Here,\ncmS (\u03a6) =\n\u221a( 2JS\nmS + JS\n) sinJS+mS ( \u03a6\n2\n) cosJS\u2212mS ( \u03a6\n2\n) , (11)\nThis results in all possible states of the spectroscopy ion system mapping to a unique transition probability in the logic ion system, PL,\u2191 = 1\u2212 PL,\u2193 = sin2(\u03c0NS,\u2193/2NS).\nTo determine the projection noise limit, we consider the signal-to-noise ratio for Ramsey spectroscopy as a function of the Ramsey phase \u03a6 = \u03b4TR. The uncertainty in a phase measurement is given by,\n\u2206\u03a6 = \u2206mL\n|d\u3008mL\u3009/d\u03a6| , (12)\nwhere (\u2206mL) 2 is the variance of a J\u0302L,z measurement on the LIs, and d\u3008mL\u3009/d\u03a6 is the slope of its expectation value as a function of the Ramsey phase. In general, projection noise of the logic ion system will add to projection noise of the spectroscopy ion system to set a fundamental limit to the signal-to-noise ratio achievable using this readout method. However, given a sufficient number of logic ions or, equivalently, a sufficient number of repetitions of the readout sequence, the added projection noise from the logic ion system can be made negligible. In that case, we recover the standard quantum limit \u2206\u03a6 = 1/ \u221a NS .\nIn Fig. S1 we numerically compute the projection noise limit for different cases of NS and NL assuming the optimum Ramsey phase \u03a6 = \u03c0/2. For NS = 1, independent of NL, the detection sequence produces a maximally entangled state of the two ions such that there is no additional projection noise from the logic ion. For NS > 1 added projection noise from the logic ion system causes a deviation from the standard quantum limit. This added noise is suppressed with increasing NL, or equivalently by repeated detections as described in the main text. One feature to note is that for NS > 2 the expectation value \u3008mL\u3009 does not vary sinusoidally as a function of the Ramsey phase. This higher error signal slope |d\u3008JL,z\u3009/d\u03a6| at \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 increases sensitivity to laser phase fluctuations and partially compensates for the additional projection noise from the logic ion system.\nNUMERICAL MODEL BEYOND THE LAMB-DICKE LIMIT\nThe geometric phases acquired through a Schro\u0308dinger cat interferometer as described here are first-order insensitive to the initial motional state, making this detection method applicable to cases outside the ground state or even approaching the Doppler cooling limit. However, we have thus far assumed that the ions remain in the Lamb-Dicke regime during the entire experimental sequence. This imposes a significant constraint in our experiments and, as we show below, violation of this assumption explains most of the observed loss of contrast in P\u2193,L as a function of |\u03b2|.\nThe state-dependent forces required for the logic and spectroscopy systems are typically produced using laser beams that have significant field gradients relative to the size of the ion motional state. Such field gradients can\n4 Fig. S1. Projection noise limit for Ramsey phase measurements using NS SIs and NL LIs based on simulation. In all cases, we assume a single repetition of the multi-ion readout sequence. The upper figures show expectation values (solid lines) and standard deviations (dashed lines) of mL measurements as a function of the Ramsey phase for two examples: NL = NS = 1 (upper left) and NL = NS = 32 (upper right). The projection noise as a function of NS is given in the lower plot for several values of NL. The standard quantum limit (dashed, black line) is determined only by NS , but there is added projection noise from the logic ion subsystem. We find the choice of NL = NS results in a small increase in the projection noise, above the standard quantum limit, which can be further suppressed with increasing NL, or equivalently by using multiple detection cycles.\nbe realized in multiple ways, which are usually broken into two categories. The first one acts on the \u03c3\u0302z logic basis (referred to as a \u03c3\u0302z-type force), and the second one acts on the orthogonal rotated basis \u03c3\u0302\u03c6 (referred to as a \u03c3\u0302\u03c6-type force). The \u03c3\u0302z-type force requires preparing |\u03c8\u3009z = |\u2193\u3009S,z (|\u2193\u3009L,z + |\u2191\u3009L,z) / \u221a 2 at the beginning, while the \u03c3\u0302\u03c6-type\nrequires |\u03c8\u3009\u03c6 = |\u2192\u3009S (|\u2192\u3009L + |\u2190\u3009L) / \u221a 2 = |\u2193\u3009L,z (|\u2193\u3009S,z + |\u2191\u3009S,z) / \u221a\n2 state. The rotation from |\u2193\u3009z to |\u2192\u3009 is done by employing a \u03c0/2 pulse on the qubit transition of the corresponding ion system. In this paper, we focus on the realization of a \u03c3\u0302\u03c6-type force using a bichromatic laser field. We note that it is possible to realize our scheme based on a \u03c3\u0302z-type force as well. In the following, we will drop the subscript z or \u03c6 without causing ambiguity to show the versatility.\nThe Hamiltonian that describing a two-level atomic ion trapped in a harmonic potential along the z\u0302-direction can be expressed as\nH\u03020 = h\u0304\u03c90\n2 \u03c3\u0302z + h\u0304\u03c9M (a\u0302a\u0302\n\u2020 + 1\n2 ), (13)\nwhere \u03c90 is the resonant frequency between the qubit |\u2193\u3009z and |\u2191\u3009z states, a\u0302 and a\u0302\u2020 are ladder operators of the harmonic oscillator. The interaction between this ion and a single mode laser can be expressed as [2]\nH\u0302I = h\u0304\u2126\n2 (\u03c3\u0302+ + \u03c3\u0302\u2212)[e\ni(kz\u0302\u2212\u03c9Lt+\u03c6L) + h.c.]. (14)\n5 where k = 2\u03c0/\u03bb = \u03c9L/c is the wave vector and \u03c6L is the phase of the laser. The Rabi frequency, \u2126, describes the coupling strength between the laser field and the ion\u2019s internal states. If the frequency of the laser \u03c9L is set close to resonance (\u03b4 = \u03c9L \u2212 \u03c90 \u2126), it is convenient to transform to the interaction picture using H\u0302int = U\u0302\u2020H\u0302I U\u0302 where U\u0302 = exp[\u2212(i/h\u0304)H\u03020t]. The interaction Hamiltonian becomes:\nH\u0302int = h\u0304\u2126\n2 [\u03c3\u0302+e\ni\u03b7(a\u0302e\u2212i\u03c9Mt+a\u0302\u2020ei\u03c9Mt)e\u2212i(\u03b4t\u2212\u03c6L) + h.c.] (15)\nWe introduce \u03b7 = k \u00b7 z0 as the Lamb-Dicke parameter, where z0 is the extent of the ground state wave function in direction z. If we strictly consider the Lamb-Dicke limit, (2\u3008n\u3009+ 1)\u03b72 1, where \u3008n\u3009 is the mean occupation number of the motional mode, we can simplify Eq. (15) by expanding it to the lowest order of \u03b7:\nH\u0302int = h\u0304\u2126\n2 [\u03c3\u0302+(1 + i\u03b7(a\u0302e\n\u2212i\u03c9M t + a\u0302\u2020ei\u03c9M t)e\u2212i(\u03b4t\u2212\u03c6L) + h.c.] (16)\nIf \u03b4 = 0, the laser field (named a \u201ccarrier pulse\u201d) would oscillate ions between |\u2193\u3009z and |\u2191\u3009z states. After neglecting the rapidly varying terms proportional to exp(\u00b1i(\u03c9L+\u03c90)t) terms (rotating-wave approximation, RWA), the Hamiltonian has the form:\nH\u0302car = h\u0304\u2126\n2 (\u03c3+e\ni\u03c6L + \u03c3\u2212e \u2212i\u03c6L). (17)\nSimilar to a single mode laser, we write the Hamiltonian of a bichromatic laser fields with frequency components \u03c91 = \u03c90\u2212\u03c9M +\u03b4s (the red detuned component) and \u03c92 = \u03c90+\u03c9M +\u03b4s (the blue detuned component) interacting with the ion simultaneously. Both components are detuned by \u03b4s from the motional sideband, where \u03b4s is the detuning of the mean frequency of the bichromatic field from the SI qubit resonance. Using the Lamb-Dicke approximation and RWA, the Hamiltonian becomes\nHint = Hrsb +Hbsb,\nHrsb = \u03b7\u2126\n2 (a\u03c3+e\ni(\u03b4t+\u03c6r) + a\u2020\u03c3\u2212e \u2212i(\u03b4t+\u03c6r)),\nHbsb = \u03b7\u2126 2 (a\u2020\u03c3+e i(\u03b4t+\u03c6b) + a\u03c3\u2212e \u2212i(\u03b4t+\u03c6b)).\n(18)\nIf we define \u03c6s = (\u03c6b + \u03c6r)/2 as the qubit phase and \u03c6m = (\u03c6b \u2212 \u03c6r)/2 as the motional phase, we can introduce a rotated basis \u03c3\u0302\u03c6 = e\n\u2212i\u03b4ste\u2212i\u03c6s \u03c3\u0302+ + ei\u03b4stei\u03c6s \u03c3\u0302\u2212. Note that \u03c3\u0302\u03c6 = \u03c3\u0302x for the case \u03b4s = 0, \u03c6s = 0 The interaction Hamiltonian now becomes:\nH\u0302 = \u03b7\u2126\n2 \u03c3\u0302\u03c6(a\u0302e\ni\u03c6M + a\u0302\u2020e\u2212i\u03c6M ). (19)\nWhen the detuning of both the red and blue components are set on resonance with the motional sideband (\u03b4s = 0), the unitary evolution of the Hamiltonian implements the state-dependent displacement operator:\nD\u0302(\u03b1(t)) = e\u03c3\u0302\u03c6[\u03b1(t)a\u0302\u2020\u2212\u03b1(t)\u2217a\u0302], (20)\nwhere \u03b1(t) = \u2212i\u03b7\u2126te\u2212i\u03c6M /2. When the condition (2\u3008n\u3009+ 1)\u03b72 1 is not satisfied, higher order terms in the Taylor expansion of ei\u03b7(a\u0302+a\u0302\u2020) must be included. This is done by replacing a\u0302 and a\u0302\u2020 with the matrix \u3008n|ei\u03b7(a\u0302+a\u0302\u2020)|n\u22121\u3009 and \u3008n\u22121|ei\u03b7(a+a\u2020)|n\u3009 respectively. We have[2]\n\u3008m|ei\u03b7(a+a\u2020)|n\u3009 = ei\u03b72/2\u03b7|m\u2212n|L|m\u2212n|n (\u03b72) ( n!\nm!\n)1/2 , (21)\nwhere n,m are Fock states included in the simulation and L\u03b1n is the generalized Laguerre polynomial\nL\u03b1n(X) = n\u2211\nm=0\n(\u22121)m ( n+ \u03b1 n\u2212m ) Xm m! . (22)\n6 Fig. S2. Comparison the numerical simulation with experimental data. All blue points represent experimental data taken with a pair of 25Mg+-27Al+ ions after ground state cooling of the COM mode. All orange traces are the results of numerical simulation using the same parameters calibrated from the experiments. (a) We first scan the duration of the driving force applied on the spectroscopy ion and manually adjust the \u03b7S and \u03b7L about 10% to make sure the period of the simulated result is the same with the experimental result. Then, we use the same parameters to run the simulation at t = t1 (a), t = t2 (b) and t = t3 (c). Note that the data used in (a) is the same one shown in Fig.1(b) in main text. An additional loss of contrast (24%) is added to all four simulation results.\nWe solve the following master equation pulse-by-pulse to get the evolution of the density matrix \u03c1(t) of the system consisting of LIs and SIs:\n\u03c1\u0307(t) = \u2212 i h\u0304 [H\u0302int(t), \u03c1(t)]. (23)\nInitially, the ions are prepared in |\u03c8\u3009 = |\u2193\u3009L(|\u2193\u3009S + |\u2191\u3009S)/ \u221a\n2 state. There are three laser pulses involved in our simulation: (1) a LI-SDD pulse on the LIs with \u03c6r = \u03c0/2, \u03c6b = \u2212\u03c0/2; (2) a SI-SD pulse on the SIs with \u03c6r = \u03c6b = 0; and (3) a LI-SDD\u22121 pulse on the LIs with \u03c6r = 3\u03c0/2, \u03c6b = \u03c0/2. As can be seen, our simulation requires knowledge of the Rabi frequency \u2126 of each laser and the Lamb-Dicke parameters, \u03b7, of LIs and SIs, respectively. We measure \u2126 of the SI-SDD and the LI-SDD by observing the Rabi oscillation of the qubit transitions of 25Mg+ and 27Al+ with a pair of 25Mg+-27Al+ ions. The Lamb-Dicke parameter is given by the ratio of the Rabi frequency of the first sideband and carrier transition after cooling to the motional ground state: \u03b7 = \u2126sb/\u2126carrier.\nIn Fig. S2, we compared experimental data with our numerical simulation results. The experiments here are done on a pair of 25Mg+-27Al+ ions after ground-state cooling. The simulation results for P\u2193,L(t) is first compared with the experimental data shown in Fig. S2(a) where t is the duration of the SI-SDD pulse. We observe that the measured Lamb-Dicke parameters for the LIs \u03b7L and SIs (\u03b7S) have a relative uncertainty of 10%, so we manually adjust both \u03b7S and \u03b7L a bit to make sure the Rabi frequency of the simulation result agrees with the experimental data. We also find that there is a loss of contrast (24%) in our experiments. The reason is not clear, so we simply reduce the contrast on the simulation results. Then, we use exactly the same parameters to simulate P\u2193,L(\u03b4s) at different pulse times: t1 = 14 \u00b5s, t2 = 28 \u00b5s and t3 = 14 \u00b5s. Note that the result at t2 = 14 \u00b5s (Fig. S2(b)) shows the same data as Fig. 2(a) in the main text. The rotation of the spin basis \u03c3\u0302\u03c6 creates complicated fringes when \u03b4s 6= 0, which is explained by our model.\nSince the Lamb-Dicke approximation requires (2\u3008n\u3009 + 1)\u03b72 1, it is straightforward to see that the non-zero temperature of the ions will lead to stronger coupling with higher-order terms. We use a pair of LI and SI to simulate the effect of this coupling. To simplify the discussion, we assume \u03b7L = \u03b7S = \u03b7 = 0.14, \u03c6M = \u03c0/2, and NS = NL = N . We define the contrast as 1\u2212P\u2193,L(\u03b8) where we set \u03b8 = \u03c0 to flip the state of the LIs. Both ions are cooled to a thermal\n7 Fig. S3. Loss of contrast due to coupling beyond the Lamb-Dicke limit. We assumed \u03b7L = \u03b7S = \u03b7, NL = NS = N in this simulation. \u3008n\u3009 indicates the mean occupation number of ion\u2019s thermal distribution of the motional mode. k = |\u03b1|/|\u03b2| is defined as the ratio of displacement on LI and SI. Although the contrast keeps decreasing when the ions move further from the Lamb-Dicke limit, reducing the Lamb-Dicke parameters (experimentally, by trapping more ions) suppressed this effect significantly.\ndistribution of the motional mode, whose temperature is described by \u3008n\u3009. As we expect, the contrast decreases as the temperature increases. In Fig. S3(a), We simulate and find that the loss of contrast is reduced as we add more ions, which reduces \u03b7 by a factor of \u221a N , where N is the total number of ions.\nAlthough one may freely choose |\u03b1| and |\u03b2| subject to the constraint 4|\u03b1||\u03b2| = \u03c0, it is wise to consider the maximum displacement in phase space \u03b4max = |\u03b1| + |\u03b2|. The mean motional occupation number at this point is \u3008n\u3009 = (|\u03b1| + |\u03b2|cos\u03c6M)2 + |\u03b2|2 should be minimized to avoid the coupling beyond the Lamb-Dicke limit. When we define k = |\u03b1|/|\u03b2| and assume \u03c6M = \u03c0/2, the simulation suggest a maximum contrast (Fig. S3(b)) when k = 1. Once again, this source of reducing contrast can be suppressed by trapping more ions.\nEXPERIMENTAL REALIZATION OF THE SPIN-DEPENDENT DISPLACEMENT\nIt is important to maintain the phase stability between the red and blue components of the bichromatic laser field. This is done through a radio-frequency (RF) mixing scheme as shown in Fig. S4. The 280 nm (for the 25Mg+ logic ions) and 266.9 nm (for the 27Al+ spectroscopy ions) laser beams are frequency and phase shifted using a series of acousto-optic modulators (AOMs). These AOMs are driven by direct digital synthesizers (DDSs) to control the frequency detuning, intensity, and phase of the lasers.\nIn the case of the 267 nm laser system, we use a double-passed AOM to provide a frequency tuning range of 50 MHz. Then, another single passed AOM centered at \u03c90,Al = 180 MHz is used for switching the beam. A DDS is employed to generate a RF signal at the motional frequency of the COM mode \u03c9M , which is mixed together with a second source at \u03c90,Al to drive the bichromatic laser field. When the 267 nm laser is tuned to be on resonance with the 1S0 \u2194 3P1 transition of 27Al+ ions, the mixed-signal \u03c90,Al\u00b1\u03c9m creates a bichromatic laser field consisting of two frequency components that are equally spaced from resonance. The mixing depth is selected that only the first-order sidebands are used to drive the motional sidebands.\nThe 280 nm laser system used for driving Raman transition on 25Mg+ uses two double-pass AOMs to split the laser into two parts, with a frequency difference of \u03c9HF = 1.2 GHz. Both the red Raman (RR) and blue Raman (BR) components go through additional single-pass AOMs centered at \u03c90,Mg = 300 MHz to provide switching of the beams. Similar to the single-pass AOM in the 267 nm laser beam line, an RF signal with a frequency of \u03c9M from the same DDS is mixed with \u03c90,Mg to generate the bichromatic laser field in the RR beam. This design makes both the LI-SDD and the SI-SDD insensitive to the motional phases of the ions [3], which will allow for scaling to larger ion crystals since the motional phases vary between different positions in the ion crystal.\nBoth \u03c90,Mg and \u03c90,Al are calibrated to drive the carrier transition of 25Mg+ ions and 27Al+ ions, respectively. The laser intensity of both the 266.9 nm laser and the 280 nm laser are controlled using separate calibration pulses at the beginning of the experimental sequence. Feedback control is applied to the drive amplitudes of the AOMs to stabilize the intensity of the laser beams. We noticed that the motional frequency drifts in a range of about 200 Hz during the experiments, so an interleaved lock-in method is used to track \u03c9M roughly every minute.\n8 Fig. S4. RF mixing scheme for the bichromatic laser field. The motionoal frequency \u03c9M is COM mode of the ions. \u03c90,Al and \u03c90,Mg are calibrated to drive the carrier transition on\n27Al+ and 25Mg+ ions, respectively (see the energy levels on the right panel).\n\u2217 cuikaifeng@apm.ac.cn \u2020 david.hume@nist.gov\n[1] F.
