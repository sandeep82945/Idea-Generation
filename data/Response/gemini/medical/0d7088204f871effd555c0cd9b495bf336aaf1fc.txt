1. **Investigate the effect of different types of nanocellulose (NC) on the properties of LFP/C composites.**

The paper demonstrates the successful synthesis of LFP/C composites using two types of NC: cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) and cellulose nanofiber (CNF). However, the study only scratches the surface of the potential of NC in this application. Future research could explore the use of other types of NC, such as bacterial cellulose, TEMPO-oxidized cellulose, or chitin nanocrystals, to further improve the properties of LFP/C composites.

2. **Optimize the synthesis conditions for LFP/C composites.**

The paper reports on the synthesis of LFP/C composites using a microwave-assisted hydrothermal method. However, the study only investigates a limited range of synthesis conditions. Future research could optimize the synthesis conditions, such as the temperature, reaction time, and NC concentration, to further improve the properties of LFP/C composites.

3. **Explore the use of LFP/C composites in different electrochemical applications.**

The paper demonstrates the potential of LFP/C composites as cathodes for lithium-ion batteries. However, LFP/C composites could also be used in other electrochemical applications, such as supercapacitors, fuel cells, and solar cells. Future research could explore the use of LFP/C composites in these applications.

4. **Investigate the long-term stability of LFP/C composites.**

The paper does not report on the long-term stability of LFP/C composites. Future research could investigate the long-term stability of LFP/C composites under different conditions, such as high temperature, high humidity, and cycling.

5. **Develop new methods for the synthesis of LFP/C composites.**

The paper reports on the synthesis of LFP/C composites using a microwave-assisted hydrothermal method. However, there may be other methods for synthesizing LFP/C composites that are more efficient, scalable, or cost-effective. Future research could develop new methods for the synthesis of LFP/C composites.
