    "abstractText": "The society for research into nicotine and tobacco established the racial equity task force in 2020 to support the Society moving \u201c... toward becoming anti-racist through the promotion of racial equity within Society for Research into Nicotine and Tobacco (SRNT), itself, as well as in the field of nicotine and commercial tobacco research\u201d.1 In January 2022 the Task Force published its final report2 that included recommendations specifically for this journal. These recommendations are related to creating safe editorial processes, enhancing capability within the editorial team, and supporting wise practice in racial equity research. The Nicotine and Tobacco Research (N&TR) editorial teams are in the process of developing responses to these recommendations that we look forward to sharing in the near future. In the meantime, this edition of N&TR contains a number of wise practice exemplars for conducting racial equity research.3\u20137 All of these papers point to the importance of not only expanding the evidence base on causes and solutions to racial and ethnic inequities but also thinking about the way we go about doing this. Kennedy\u2019s study6 investigated Indigenous-led cessation care. As part of the method, each author described their relationship to Aboriginal or Torres Straight Island peoples. Such positioning places the researcher within the research frame as opposed to being an objective onlooker. Such positioning invites both the researcher and the reader to reflect on how our experiences, relationships, and biases affect the way we understand racial and ethnic populations. This is a particular consideration where the researcher does not have a relationship with the population of interest. Inevitably these positions influence how we conceptualize, conduct, and interpret our research. Transparency in our positioning can help us examine the potential of research to contribute to tobacco-related inequities among racial and ethnic groups. Philosophers such as Foucault8 have recognized the intimate relationship between knowledge (the product of research) and power. In the context of commercial tobacco research examples include the power to influence what people think about a racial or ethnic group\u2019s tobacco use experiences and the power to influence how resources are used (or not) to address commercial tobacco use within these populations. As conduits of power making our positions transparent (particularly in relation to those exposed to racism and social injustices) can create opportunities to address power imbalances. For example, both Kennedy6 and Pattern7 place partnering and co-design with racial or ethnic communities as being central to their respective research methods. Such approaches highlight the importance of meaningful engagement with knowledge holders, owners, and users thereby prioritizing their needs. Three papers3\u20135 in this edition draw attention to the role of society and context when understanding racial and ethnic inequities. They caution against research that implies the causes of these inequities are inherent to those populations. Instead, they note how the mechanics of racism and colonization (often referred to as \u201cfundamental causes\u201d9) are often imbued within the institutions that produce the determinants of health (for example, education, employment policies, employment, and housing). As such, fundamental causes may affect how racial or ethnic populations access these institutions, the experiences they have, and how this ultimately affects their health and well-being. This raises important implications for how we think about commercial tobacco control research. For example, is it possible to understand the causes of smoking inequities (or how they might be addressed) if our studies are focused on the individual level and do not measure health determinants or fundamental causes? Alternatively, is it possible to address these \u201cwicked problems\u201d when the research we conduct is focused on interventions within the health sector? We hope that in responding to racial equity our evidence is more able to answer these questions. Finally, Choi et al4 and Jackson et al5 challenge us to think about what \u201crace\u201d or \u201cethnicity\u201d actually means. They note the importance of considering these constructs as representing a complex range of experiences within a social context rather than an individual or ethnic/racial population trait that can be \u201ccontrolled\u201d within the analysis process. Advancing how commercial tobacco research contributes to addressing racial and ethnic inequities requires careful reflection on wise practices for how research is conducted, analyzed, reported, and published. The examples, highlighted in this editorial provide important insights into how we can advance research processes. We look forward to extending these insights into the publishing process.
