    "abstractText": "Information on the spatiotemporal variability of soil properties and states within the agricultural landscape is vital to identify management zones supporting precision agriculture (PA). Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and electromagnetic induction (EMI) techniques have been applied to assess soil properties, states, processes, and their spatiotemporal variability. This paper reviews the fundamental operating principles of GPR and EMI, their applications in soil studies, advantages and disadvantages, and knowledge gaps leading to the identification of the difficulties in integrating these two techniques to complement each other in soil data studies. Compared to the traditional methods, GPR and EMI have advantages, such as the ability to take non-destructive repeated measurements, high resolution, being labor-saving, and having more extensive spatial coverage with geo-referenced data within agricultural landscapes. GPR has been widely used to estimate soil water content (SWC) and water dynamics, while EMI has broader applications such as estimating SWC, soil salinity, bulk density, etc. Additionally, GPR can map soil horizons, the groundwater table, and other anomalies. The prospects of GPR and EMI applications in soil studies need to focus on the potential integration of GPR and EMI to overcome the intrinsic limitations of each technique and enhance their applications to support PA. Future advancements in PA can be strengthened by estimating many soil properties, states, and hydrological processes simultaneously to delineate management zones and calculate optimal inputs in the agricultural landscape.",

            "text": "An increasing global population, coupled with the uncertainty of climate change, is resulting in an agricultural expansion to improve food security. This expansion is highlighting the need for the application of innovative technologies to increase and optimize food productivity. Consequently, agricultural expansion (i.e., the conversion of natural lands into agriculture) and the associated increased agrochemical inputs have resulted in adverse environmental impacts such as the pollution of land and water resources, thereby impacting the food chain and subsequently affecting the health of the soil, water, people, flora, and fauna [1\u20134]. The excessive use of agrochemicals increases the accumulation of harmful chemicals in the soil, groundwater, and water bodies [5]. Minimizing the environmental and socio-economic threats caused by the expansion and intensification of agriculture may be conducted by implementing precise agricultural strategies [1,6,7]. Precision agriculture (PA), supported by various technologies, is a rapidly emerging field for managing the agricultural landscape on a large scale by considering the field\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 2932. https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15112932 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 2932 2 of 36\nvariability for increasing agricultural productivity while minimizing negative environmental impacts and the production cost [6,8,9]. Agricultural practices such as irrigation, land preparation, and fertilization are typically applied uniformly across the entire field, treating the heterogeneous fields as homogeneous. However, the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the agricultural landscape can be effectively monitored through implementing different technologies to support PA, including (1) geographic information systems (GIS), (2) satellite-based global positioning systems (GPS), (3) remote sensing, (4) drones, (5) the Internet of Things, (6) artificial intelligence, and (7) different proximal sensors, for example, geophysical techniques [2,6,10]. These digital technologies are applied to collect, process, monitor, and map the spatiotemporal variability of the agricultural landscape. Their purpose is to improve agronomic performance, enhance crop productivity and develop decision support tools [4,6,9,11\u201317]. By utilizing the latest technologies, such as unmanned aerial vehicles, agricultural machinery, and robotic technologies, the required amounts of water, nutrients, and agrochemicals for plant growth and development can be accurately applied to specific locations within the agricultural landscape and within the appropriate timeframe [1,2,4,6,12,13,18,19]. PA offers several benefits, including improved soil fertility and health, increased water productivity and food security, minimized soil and water pollution, and reduced labor force requirements, as well as the overuse of resources such as water, fertilizer, seeds, and energy, leading to lower production costs [1\u20134,20]. The incorporation of spatiotemporal variability mapping with geo-statistics and GIS marked a major advance in PA to a new level to identify management zones [11,12,21]. The spatiotemporal variability of crop factors and subsurface physical, chemical, and hydrological properties, and processes are crucial in PA [6]. Hydro-geophysics is an efficient approach that includes multi-scale probing and high-resolution imaging techniques for accurately obtaining the spatiotemporal variability of the subsurface hydrological processes and soil properties [22\u201325]. Traditional methods such as soil sampling and laboratory analysis are destructive, labor-intensive, costly in large scales, time-consuming, and mainly provide point scale measurements only [6,22,26,27]. Commonly used geophysical techniques in hydro-geophysics are electrical resistivity tomography, electromagnetic induction (EMI), self-potential, ground-penetrating radar (GPR), induced polarization, surface nuclear magnetic resonance, gravity, magnetics, and seismic methods [25\u201328]. However, not all these techniques are commonly used in PA applications. The main limitations of these geophysical techniques are their complexity of use, poor automation ability, and high initial capital cost. In addition, they mainly provide indirect proxy information only; thus, some instruments, such as EMI, need site-specific calibration [17,25,29,30]. Among these geophysical techniques, this article mainly reviews applications of GPR and EMI as rapidly emerging electromagnetic techniques in soil studies to estimate the spatiotemporal variation of soil properties with particular emphasis on agricultural applications. GPR and EMI applications have some advantages in the agricultural landscape compared to the other geophysical methods. For example, the electrical resistivity method requires electrode installation. Therefore, it disturbs the subsurface and is time-consuming for large-scale applications. On the other hand, the sampling depth of the electrical resistivity and seismic methods is extensive and beyond the root zone. The use of GPR and EMI has been extensively studied and documented in various fields, including forestry, archaeology, engineering, geology/geoengineering, and environmental science [29,31,32]. Moreover, GPR and EMI use in agriculture is also well documented with a focus on elucidating soil properties and states such as bulk density, porosity, soil compaction, soil texture, cation exchange capacity (CEC), soil salinity, clay content, soil organic matter (SOM), soil water content (SWC), infiltration capacity, and water holding capacity [28,29,32]. Huisman et al. [33] reviewed the estimation of SWC using various methods with GPR, including the reflected wave velocity, ground wave velocity, transmitted wave velocity (in boreholes), and surface reflection coefficient, while van Dam [34] discussed different calibration functions to estimate SWC using GPR. Liu et al. [35] and Klotzsche et al. [36]\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 2932 3 of 36\nupdated the review of Huisman et al. [33] by including modern techniques applied to estimate SWC, such as full-waveform inversion, average envelope amplitude, and the frequency shift method. Recently, Zaj\u00edcov\u00e1 and Chuman [32] reviewed applications of GPR in soil studies, including SWC, stratigraphy, soil salinity, and soil texture, and Zhang et al. [37] reviewed GPR applications with SWC and soil hydraulic properties. Doolittle and Brevik [29] reviewed applications of EMI in soil studies, including soil properties such as soil salinity, SWC, soil texture, clay content, and CEC. The majority of previous reviews have focused on either GPR or EMI with a singular focus on estimating SWC. This review builds upon yet differs from the above-mentioned reviews by summarizing a wide range of applications previously conducted to determine soil properties and states using GPR, EMI, or both. Additional properties discussed in this review include soil salinity, bulk density, soil porosity, and soil hydraulic properties. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the use of GPR and EMI techniques in soil studies for estimating critical agricultural soil information. This article reviewed >250 peer-reviewed journal articles, conference papers, and books primarily related to the principles and applications of GPR and EMI in agriculture and soil studies (Figure 1). Metadata analysis was conducted using keywords associated with GPR and EMI applications in soil studies. GPR and EMI applications are graphically presented and summarized as percentage data (Figure 1). Co-occurrence term maps were developed for the past 15 years (2007\u20132022) by referring to the number of articles on GPR and EMI applications in agriculture based on keywords to focus on the latest research articles to support future directions (Figure 1). This review begins with the general background information and discusses electromagnetic methods, including their theoretical and empirical background. The review then discusses GPR and its fundamental principles, as well as their application to soil studies, including SWC, porosity, compaction, soil salinity, hydraulic properties, groundwater table, and capillary fringe reflection. Then, this review discusses EMI and its basic principles, along with its applications to soil studies, including soil salinity, SWC, bulk density, soil compaction, and some applications with magnetic susceptibility. Finally, the review offers insights, synthesis, and critical analysis, while the summary and future directions section presents an overview and highlights areas for future research.\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 2932 4 of 36 Remote Sens. 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 38\nFigure 1.

GPR and EMI are the most used near-surface geophysical techniques/proximal sensors in agriculture and related fields that use electromagnetic waves [17,28]. The advantages of\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 2932 5 of 36\nthese two techniques include the ability to survey a relatively large area within a short time and with the minimal land disturbance, thereby allowing for repeated measurements at the exact location, with a larger sample volume compared with the traditional methods and relatively low operational costs [29,41]. GPR uses high-frequency (VHF-UHF) electromagnetic waves, while EMI uses relatively low-frequency (VLF) electromagnetic waves in various applications. Low-frequency and high-frequency fields have different sensitivities with respect to their material properties, different operational methods, and applications in soil studies (Table 1).\n2.1. Theoretical and Empirical Equations and Models Used in Applications of Electromagnetic Methods 2.1.1. Topp\u2019s Equation\nTopp et al. [42] developed an empirical relationship, i.e., a third-degree polynomial equation,\n\u03b8v = \u22125.3 \u00d7 10\u22122 + 2.92 \u00d7 10\u22122\u03b5r\u22125.5 \u00d7 10\u22124\u03b52r + 4.3 \u00d7 10\u22126\u03b53r (1)\nbetween the soil\u2019s relative dielectric permittivity \u03b5r and volumetric water content (\u03b8v). This relationship was assessed against the effect of soil texture, bulk density, temperature, soluble salts, and hysteresis and found to be relatively independent of these properties [42]. Topp\u2019s equation is the most widely applied and accepted empirical equation in GPR applications since it is simple, relatively accurate, and valid for fully and partially saturated conditions [43]. However, in peat or organic-rich and heavy clay soils, the applicability of this relationship has limitations [44\u201346].\n2.1.2. Archie\u2019s Equation\nArchie [47] developed two empirical relationships between the apparent electrical conductivity (\u03c3a), soil water saturation (SW), pore water electrical conductivity (\u03c3w), and porosity (\u03d5) of porous rocks by conducting laboratory experiments. In this relationship, n is the saturation exponent and m is the cementation exponent. Archie\u2019s first equation was developed for the resistivity of fully saturated porous rocks, and the second law was developed for partly saturated porous rocks [47]. Shah and Singh [48], Ewing and Hunt [49], and Glover [50,51] modified Archie\u2019s equation,\n\u03c3a = 1 a \u03d5mSnw\u03c3w (2)\nand applied it to soils.\n2.1.3. Complex Refractive Index Model\nThe complex refractive index model (CRIM) is a three-phase (solid\u2014s, water\u2014w, and air\u2014a) volumetric mixing model. The CRIM equation is a theoretical approach that describes the bulk \u03b5r as a function of \u03d5 and SW [52]:\nE\u03b1r(b)= \u03d5SW\u03b5 \u03b1 r(w) + (1\u2212\u03d5)\u03b5 \u03b1 r(s)+\u03d5(1 \u2212 Sw ) \u03b5\u03b1r(a) (3)\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 2932 6 of 36\nThe geometric factor (\u03b1) is related to the orientation of the electric field concerning the geometry of the solid phase. In GPR applications, CRIM estimates properties such as SW and \u03d5with acceptable accuracy [53\u201355].\n2.1.4. Rhoades\u2019s Equation\nRhoades et al. [56] developed a relationship between \u03c3a as a function of SWC (\u03b8) and \u03c3w:\n\u03c3a = \u03c3w \u03b8T + \u03c3s (4)\nwhere T is the transmission coefficient considering the tortuosity of the flow path as water content changes.

            "text": "GPR is a near-surface electromagnetic proximal sensor commonly used in agriculture and environmental applications [57\u201359]. Commercially available GPR systems use unguided electromagnetic waves with frequencies ranging from 10 MHz to 3600 MHz [36,58]. Resolution and depth of penetration are vital factors of GPR applications. Radar wave propagation velocity and wave attenuation depend on primary electromagnetic properties such as the relative dielectric permittivity (\u03b5r), electric conductivity \u03c3, and magnetic permeability (\u00b5) of the soil/media [58,59]. \u03b5r is mainly controlled by the water content of the subsurface as the permittivity of liquid water overwhelms those of other soil constituents [42,58]. Equation (5)\nv = c\u221a \u03b5r\n(5)\nshows the relationship between velocity (v) and \u03b5r, where c is the propagation velocity of electromagnetic waves in free space, which is equal to the speed of light (0.3 m/ns) [58]. The penetration depth of GPR is mainly determined by the \u03c3 of subsurface materials and the operation frequency [33,41,57,58]. When EM waves travel through conductive materials, EM energy is lost as heat through the electrical current. In addition, energy loss in EM waves is due to increasing operating frequency and scattering. This energy loss is called attenuation and, therefore, reduces the penetration depth of GPR waves [57,58,60,61]. GPR wave attenuation also results from geometrical spreading in 3D wave propagation. The resolution of GPR increases with increasing frequency, increasing bandwidth, and decreasing wave velocity, since the wavelength (\u03bb) is inversely proportional to the frequency (f) and directly proportional to the velocity (\u03bb = v/f) [61\u201363]. The radiation pattern of a GPR antenna is the primary determinant of its footprint, which is the subsurface area illuminated by the radiation emitted from the antenna. The shape and extent of the radiation pattern depend on several factors, including the antenna design, frequency, size, shape, and dielectric properties of the subsurface. The beam width of the radiation pattern is also affected by the dielectric permittivity of the subsurface, with higher permittivity resulting in a narrower beam. The most common GPR system consists of an impulse generator that repeatedly sends a source of a particular voltage and frequency to a transmitting antenna. It is worth noting that frequency-domain radars are also available in addition to impulse radars and are also referred to as time-domain radars [64]. They operate by successively transmitting continuous waves over a specific frequency range. Ground-coupled and air-coupled horn antennas are used for on-ground and air-borne GPR surveys, respectively (Figure 2).\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 2932 7 of 36Remote Sens. 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 38\n(a) (b)\nFigure 2.

Capacitance\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 2932 9 of 36\nprobes, neutron probes, the gravimetric method, and time domain reflectometry (TDR) are used for validating GPR-estimated SWC [67,69\u201376].\na. Reflected wave velocity method\nThe reflected wave velocity method is used to acquire SWCV in deeper soil layers. However, reflectors such as isolated objects or interfaces are required to obtain the travel time of the reflected radar wave. Natural reflectors such as rocks and roots and artificial reflectors such as pipes are point reflectors, while lithologic layers and the water table are interfaces [41,71,72,77\u201379]. The two-way travel time of the GPR wave above the reflector is measured and converted into radar wave velocity, then to \u03b5r, and is then used to calculate the SWCV [76,80,81]. The velocity of the reflected wave is obtained using an FOM or multiple offset methods (MOM): CMP or WARR. When the depth of the reflector is known, the reflected wave velocity is estimated in the FOM by dividing the depth of the reflector by the two-way travel time. Lunt et al. [80] applied the reflected wave velocity method under natural conditions, while Stoffregen et al. [82], Loeffler and Bano [83], Ercoli et al. [81], and Zhou et al. [84] applied it under controlled conditions to obtain SWCV. With advanced analysis techniques, the average velocity of a reflector can be obtained by fitting a hyperbola [76,85\u201387]. On the other hand, CMP and WARR methods are applied as multiple offset methods when the depth of the reflector is unknown. However, data collection and processing in this method are time-consuming and labor-intensive [35,36]. Steelman and Endress [88] applied the multi-frequency CMP method in three different sites to estimate the vertical variation of SWCV with the reflected wave method during a complete annual cycle, including wetting/drying and freezing/thawing. The reflection method for determining SWCV has some limitations, as it depends on the continuous availability of reflectors, especially in shallow soils [76].\nb. Direct ground wave velocity method\nOn the other hand, the DGW velocity method of GPR can be used to estimate the SWCV of shallow (uppermost centimeters) soils without employing a reflector [35,67,71,74,89]. Both the FOM and MOM can be used to estimate SWCV from the direct ground wave, though the MOM is time-consuming and laborious compared to the FOM [67,89]. To address this, Sperl [63] established a method to estimate SWCV over a large area by combining the MOM and FOM. In this method, the MOM only decides the most suitable antenna separation to distinguish between the DGW and the direct airwave. Then, the FOM is applied with the decided antenna separation to collect data effectively over a large area [35,90]. Huisman et al. [89] assessed the accuracy of DGW to estimate and map SWCV over a large area with WARR and the FOM (single trace analysis). The accuracy of SWC estimated based on WARR measurements was \u00b10.030 m3/m3, while it was \u00b10.037 m3/m3 based on the FOM when compared with the TDR method. Therefore, the authors suggested that the available TDR calibrations, such as Topp\u2019s equation [42], can also be applied to GPR [89]. Furthermore, the authors suggested that the most appropriate assessment between electromagnetic methods (TDR and GPR) is \u03b5r, rather than SWCV. Galagedara et al. [67] and Huisman and Bouten [73] discussed the importance of accurate time-zero calibration to estimate SWCV using the DGW method. Huisman and Bouten [73] conducted a sensitivity analysis to study time-zero error at zero antennae offset with WARR measurements. The authors found that GPR simulations could not account for the meantime shift at zero offset due to the time-picking error and SWCV heterogeneity in the sensitivity analysis. Galagedara et al. [67] suggested an accurate and stable time-zero picking methodology to estimate SWCV with an error rate of less than 1% under variable water contents. Huisman et al. [91] found that GPR is an efficient technique to map SWCV over an agricultural landscape, and GPR-estimated water content matched well with TDR results. The accuracy and spatial and temporal variability of the SWC under different water contents, such as irrigation and drainage conditions, have been studied by several researchers [67,72,74,77,91\u201394]. In addition, SWC variation under dry and rainy seasons was\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 2932 10 of 36\nstudied by Thitimakorn et al. [95], while Cao et al. [96] studied three-dimensional soil water dynamics before and after heavy rainfall. These studies compared SWC estimated from the DGW and found good agreements with TDR or gravimetric methods as standard methods. Weiherm\u00fcller et al. [97] mapped the spatial variability of SWC with the DGW method at a silty loam site with 450 MHz center frequency antennas. However, Weiherm\u00fcller et al. [97] compared GPR (450 MHz)-estimated SWCV with TDR and volumetric samples and found that the results of the GPR did not agree well with that of the TDR and volumetric samples. The reason behind this was reported to be the high signal attenuation of the GPR due to the relatively high clay content present [97]. However, previous studies have also identified some issues with the DGW method. It is challenging to distinguish the direct airwave and DGW under dry conditions since the velocity of GPR is high. Therefore, the DGW also reaches the Rx rapidly and interferes with the direct airwave [67,77,94]. The effective penetration depth of the GPR DGW varies with the soil texture, antenna frequency, and wet/dry conditions present [67,70,74,90,98]. The heterogeneity of the upper soil layer can produce reflections which interfere with DGW. Radar wave attenuates with higher conductivity, and therefore, the penetration depth decreases with increases in high-conductive materials such as clay. Galagedara et al. [99] applied a numerical model to investigate the effective sampling depth of the GPR DGW in terms of antenna frequency and dry/wet two-layer conditions. The authors found that the penetration depth of the DGW decreases with increasing frequency and wetness since the sampling depth is a function of the wavelength [63,90,99]. Table 2 summarizes the previous studies related to the penetration depth of the GPR DGW when estimating SWC.\n* Modelling results: A\u2014dry over wet layer; B\u2014wet over dry layer.\nc. Transmitted wave velocity method\nIn the transmitted wave velocity method, both the Tx and Rx antennas are placed in boreholes or in surface drains, and the direct wave passing through the media is used to estimate the SWCV [68,69,101\u2013104]. In the early stage, ZOP and MOG measurements were widely applied. However, using ZOP and MOG, direct waves interfere with reflected and critically refracted waves in low-velocity zones and underestimate the SWC. Therefore, VRP was introduced [105\u2013107]. VRP requires only one borehole; thus, the ground disturbance and cost are relatively low. Across several studies, the transmitted wave velocity method\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 2932 11 of 36\nwas applied to estimate SWCV [68,101,103,104], even though the method is not widely used to estimate SWCV at the root zone in agriculture [68,102,104]. Nevertheless, Wijewardana and Galagedara [69] applied the transmitted direct wave method to estimate SWCV in raised bed agricultural fields, where Tx and Rx were moved along the surface drains of raised beds.\nd. Surface reflection coefficient method\nThe surface reflection coefficient method is an off-ground GPR technique; both antennas are moved above ground, and the SWCV is estimated based on the amplitude of the reflected wave at the soil surface. The underlying equations and modeling hypotheses are detailed and discussed in particular detail in Lambot et al. [108]. This method determines the reflection coefficient (R) using the amplitude of the reflections from the soil surface (A). The amplitude of the reflections from the perfect electric conductor (APEC) is positioned at the same distance as the soil (Equations (6) and (7)). Adekani. [94], al Hagrey and M\u00fcller [109], Redman et al. [110], and Redman et al. [111] applied this method to estimate SWC. This method is more suitable for agricultural applications such as optimizing seeding depth and irrigation management in very thin upper soil layers [0\u20130.10 m] [94]. However, the practical applicability of the GPR surface reflection coefficient method for estimating soil moisture is constrained by its sensitivity to calibration height, which is difficult to maintain consistently in real-world field applications. Moreover, the method relies on a simplified assumption of 1D propagation, which does not account for the antenna, further limiting its accuracy.\nR = 1 \u2212\u221a\u03b5r(soil) 1+\u221a\u03b5r(soil)\n(6)\nR = A\nAPEC (7)\ne. Average envelope amplitude method\nWhen estimating the SWC using the DGW with the FOM, differentiating the DGW and the direct air wave is often challenging. To avoid this problem, Pettinelli et al. [112] proposed a method to analyze early time signal amplitude (first arrival direct wave\u2014 a combined direct airwave and DGW) without considering the separate travel times of the direct air and ground waves. In the AEA method, SWC is assessed by correlating \u03b5r variation with attributes of the early time signal of GPR [112,113]. Furthermore, the AEA is sensitive to both \u03b5r and \u03c3a and changes in waveform attributes such as shape, amplitude, and duration with changing \u03b5r and \u03c3a [112,114]. Pettinelli et al. [112] applied the AEA of the early time signal to estimate the SWC in a controlled field condition, Ferrara et al. [115] applied it under natural field conditions, and Ferrara et al. [116] applied it under laboratory conditions. Algeo et al. [117] compared two early time signal analysis methods\u2014the AEA method and the carrier frequency amplitude method\u2014to map SWC and found that both methods have strengths and weaknesses. Another study assessed the applicability of AEA in early time signals to study SWC during irrigation and showed the possibility of this method in estimating SWC in clay-rich soils [114]. However, this AEA method is still in development, and further research studies are needed to estimate soil properties under different field conditions.\nf. Full waveform inversion method\nFWI is a numerical modeling method that retrieves the unknown \u03b5r and/or \u03c3 distribution from a known EM field by fitting a full-wave EM model to the radar measurements [64].

However, for frequencies below 100 MHz, the soil conductivity (\u03c3) can also significantly influence the reflection coefficient [108]. At these low frequencies, the sensitivity of the reflection to \u03c3 becomes higher than that of \u03b5r. Wu and Lambot [129] proposed a new method for mapping soil \u03c3 using relatively low-frequency drone-borne GPR and full-wave inversion techniques. Their method works best when the dielectric permittivity and conductivity are not too large. Although the sensitivity to \u03b5r is not negligible in this frequency range, their method demonstrated good agreement with the \u03c3 values obtained from EMI surveys.\nTraditionally, the reflection coefficient at the soil surface is assumed to depend solely on the contrast in dielectric permittivity (\u03b5r) between the soil and the air. However, for frequencies below 100 MHz, the soil conductivity (\u03c3) can also significantly influence the reflection coefficient [108]. At these low frequencies, the sensitivity of the reflection to \u03c3 becomes higher than that of \u03b5r.

Soil Porosity and Soil Compaction\nSoil porosity indirectly influences GPR propagation wave velocity and amplitude. When pore spaces are filled with water, it changes the \u03b5r, which changes the v. Therefore, \u03b5r at saturation can be used as an indicator of total porosity [43,53,134\u2013136]. Macro-pores can trap more water during saturation (irrigation and excess rainfall) since their infiltration rate is high, but water will drain quickly due to gravity and become dry [137]. This phenomenon will affect the velocity of GPR waves, where velocity decreases during infiltration and increases during drainage. This velocity variation is rapid in coarse-textured soils, and wetting and drying are faster than in fine-textured soils. Micropores can hold more water against gravity through capillary action, and micropores are more common in clay soil, even though the GPR waves attenuate due to the high \u03c3 of clay [134,137]. Different researchers initially assessed soil porosity using GPR wave velocity [43,53, 135,138]. However, a reliable method to estimate porosity, bulk density, soil compaction, or soil penetration resistance using GPR has yet to be developed and tested. In unsaturated\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 2932 13 of 36\nsoils, pore spaces are filled with both water and air. The relationship between soil porosity, soil water saturation, and SWCv is crucial when finding the porosity with GPR. If the soil water saturation is known, porosity can be estimated since SWCv can be obtained from GPR [136]. Additionally, under fully saturated conditions, SWCV is equal to the soil porosity [137,138]; thus, GPR can be used to estimate soil porosity by measuring the SWCV at saturation. Due to the difficulty of estimating porosity alone with GPR, researchers have integrated other geophysical techniques and different theoretical and empirical approaches with GPR. Laboratory-scale experiments were conducted to estimate soil porosity using GPR [53,54,135] and field-scale experiments [43,136]. However, the differences between the experimental scales and laboratory-scale measurements must be tested before their application to field conditions [54,135]. Turesson [43] estimated the porosity and soil water saturation of sand, and Khalil et al. [136] estimated the porosity and soil water saturation of a sandstone aquifer using GPR and resistivity techniques using both Topp\u2019s equation (Equation (1) and Archie\u2019s equation (Equation (2)). Ghose and Slob [135] assessed the porosity and soil water saturation of shallow subsoil by developing integrated GPR-seismic techniques through numerical modeling. Meanwhile, Lai et al. [53] proposed a new method to determine porosity using GPR, namely, the cyclic moisture variation technique. In this method, the authors determined the variation of \u03b5r and soil water saturation from a partially saturated state to a fully saturated state of the soil and modified the CRIM equation (Equation (3)) to obtain the porosity. Researchers have also applied GPR to assess the effect of heavy machinery on soil compaction, a serious problem in agricultural fields [139\u2013141]. With compaction, porosity decreases, consequently increasing the bulk density and penetration resistance, thereby reducing water infiltration [139,142]. Previous studies showed that compaction changes GPR attributes, i.e., propagation wave velocity and amplitude [139\u2013144]. Moreover, researchers found a negative correlation between GPR wave amplitude and compaction/penetration resistance [139\u2013142]. This negative correlation may be due to reduced free water and increased bound water in the soil structure, resulting in increased water-soluble salts in soil pore water, thereby increasing the soil\u2019s bulk \u03c3 and attenuating GPR waves and decaying the wave amplitudes [142]. Another reason could be that increasing the soil density increases the EM wave reflection more than the transmission; hence, the EM energy, wave amplitude, and penetration depth decrease [142]. On the other hand, Akinsunmade et al. [139] and Akinsunmade [140] found that GPR signals penetrate deeper depths in compacted areas than in uncompacted areas. With soil compaction, porosity, and SWC, \u03b5r decreases, while GPR wave velocity and wavelength increase, increasing the penetration depth [139\u2013141].\n3.2.3. Soil Salinity\nSoil \u03c3 is the best parameter to use to estimate soil salinity [57,145,146]. In agricultural fields, soil \u03c3 is temporally unstable since it frequently changes, mainly with SWC, due to, for example, irrigation, drainage, leaching, evapotranspiration, fertilizer application, and other soil amendments [146,147]. Soil \u03c3 is mainly measured using: (1) saturated paste extract electrical conductivity (\u03c3e); (2) apparent electrical conductivity (\u03c3a); and (3) soil water electrical conductivity (\u03c3w). The estimation of the \u03c3e of the soil using soil samples in the laboratory is the standard method [60,148] for soil salinity measurements. This standard method is time-consuming, laborious, and costly for large-scale applications. Therefore, electrical resistivity, EMI, and TDR techniques are widely used as alternative methods. However, these alternative methods provide the \u03c3a of the subsurface but not the \u03c3w or \u03c3e [146,149\u2013154]. The three main current flow pathways contributing to the \u03c3 are the liquid, solid\u2013liquid, and solid phases [150,155]. However, \u03c3w is the most appropriate measurement since it is the salinity experienced by plant roots. \u03c3w is impossible to obtain directly using alternative methods in the field, and it is difficult to measure in the laboratory [149,150].\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 2932 14 of 36\nIn the literature, soil salinity is expressed in different ways using terms such as \u03c3a, \u03c3w, \u03c3e, and \u03c3 at different soil: water (\u03c3 1:1, \u03c31:2, and \u03c31:5) ratios. The \u03c3 of the solid phase (\u03c3s) is an important property in agricultural soils and a key variable in PA. It strongly correlates to clay content, a textural property that strongly influences soil water storage, dynamics, and plant growth. Together with SWC, \u03c3s significantly impacts the measured \u03c3a, making it an excellent surrogate for mapping clay content, usually with EMI [149,150]. Researchers have identified that the influence of \u03c3 on GPR wave propagation limits GPR applications, including in agricultural soils. In most applications, such as locating buried objects or utilities and stratigraphic studies, a high \u03c3 restricts the GPR signal penetration due to attenuation [40,58,60,62]. Soils with high clay content (illite and montmorillonite) have a high CEC and high \u03c3, leading to higher GPR signal attenuation in clay-rich soils [57,61,62]. However, this limitation (i.e., the influence of \u03c3 on GPR wave propagation) can be used as an opportunity in other applications, such as contamination mapping, identifying highly saline areas in PA, and seawater intrusion. Mimrose et al. [156] studied the influence of irrigation water salinity on the GPR signals using different salt-water concentrations. The authors showed that the amplitude of the GPR reflected wave is inversely proportional to irrigation water salinity. Ferrara et al. [116] applied the early time GPR amplitude analysis method to find the influence of the \u03c3 on GPR wave amplitude under uniform \u03b5r conditions using salt-water. In this study, the authors found a high correlation between \u03c3 and GPR reflected wave amplitude. Alsharahi et al. [157] used a numerical modeling approach to estimate reflections from iron bars and plastic bottles to evaluate the effect of \u03b5r and \u03c3 on GPR waves and found that the reflected wave amplitude decreases as \u03c3 increases. Wu et al. [154] assessed \u03c3 variations by applying the waveform comparison method under different conductivities by implementing the GPR reflection coefficient method. In previous studies, GPR was applied to identify and map soil contaminants such as excess fertilizers, soil amendments, leachates from dump sites, and hydrocarbons. Wijewardana et al. [158\u2013160] studied the effect of inorganic contaminants produced from landfill leachate on the GPR responses through field studies, controlled lysimeters, and a modeling approach. The authors found that GPR signal strength decreases with increasing contaminant concentrations due to increasing \u03c3 in contaminant plumes. The reflected wave disappeared completely at high \u03c3 levels due to attenuation [160]. Reflected wave amplitude decreased with increasing \u03c3, and further research in this field was suggested, since these methods could potentially evaluate \u03c3 variation in the subsurface and contamination mapping using the reflected wave amplitude [156,160,161]. The R at an interface increases as the \u03c3 contrast increases. Nevertheless, as \u03c3 attenuates GPR waves in a given layer, it lowers the amplitude of the reflection amplitude for the lower interfaces. Under laboratory conditions, full-wave inversion was successfully used to retrieve soil conductivity (\u03c3), as demonstrated by Lambot et al. [64]. However, in field conditions with unknown subsurface layering, the inverse problem becomes ill-posed, and the retrieval of \u03c3 becomes challenging.\n3.2.4. Soil Hydraulic Properties\nAs described by the water retention curve and hydraulic conductivity function, unsaturated soil hydraulic properties govern subsurface water dynamics [137]. Hence, as GPR permits the characterization of SWC, time-lapse GPR offers the possibility to characterize these properties through the monitoring of SWC and its dynamics [37,162]. This requires the coupling of the GPR derived-soil moisture or a GPR data processing algorithm with a soil hydrodynamic model, for example, one based on Richards\u2019 equation [163]. For instance, Binley et al. [101], Rucker and Ferr\u00e9 [106], Cassiani and Binley [164], and Kowalsky et al. [165] applied borehole GPR and tomographic inversion to monitor the distribution of water between boreholes and infer soil hydraulic properties. Lambot et al. [64] remotely characterized the hydraulic properties of a laboratory soil column using full-wave GPR data inversion and subsequent soil hydrodynamic inversion. Lambot et al. [108] introduced an integrated 3D full-wave electromagnetic and 1-D hydrodynamic inverse modeling\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 2932 15 of 36\nprocedure to estimate the soil hydraulic properties from far-field GPR measurements. The method was further studied and applied in the field by Jadoon et al. [166,167]. Tran et al. [130] used data assimilation techniques based on a maximum likelihood ensemble filter to estimate the soil hydraulic properties and reconstruct continuous soil moisture profiles. Despite the promising perspectives for environmental engineering applications shown in these studies, the utilization of joint GPR and hydrodynamic modeling approaches has proven to be challenging, particularly in the agricultural context, because the parameterization of these models is complex and requires a detailed understanding of the soil stratigraphy, petrophysical relationships, and boundary conditions for the hydrodynamic model.\n3.2.5. Groundwater Table and Capillary Fringe Reflection\nDetermining the depth to the groundwater table (DGWT) is crucial in water management because DGWT affects groundwater recharge, water supply to plants, and contaminant accumulation and transport (especially agrochemicals) [168,169]. Capillary fringe and the groundwater table fluctuate with seasonal variations, affecting agricultural water management, especially during the growing season. Indirect geophysical techniques such as GPR and seismic and resistivity techniques have been employed as alternative methods to traditional destructive piezometer installation when estimating DGWT. GPR is appropriate to estimate the DGWT of shallow aquifers (0\u201330 m) non-destructively on a large-scale [165,170\u2013173]. Information on the groundwater table fluctuation during the growing season is vital to understand the water availability for crops through capillarity and groundwater contamination potentials due to agricultural inputs. The soil above (i.e., unsaturated) and the soil below (i.e., saturated) the water table have different SWCs and thus have different \u03b5r values [42,168,171,174\u2013176]. Therefore, due to the contrast in \u03b5r at the interface, the water table can be identified in the radargrams [171, 174,177]. Nevertheless, due to the capillary rise, the transition from the saturated zone to the unsaturated zone (capillary fringe) is not sharp, especially in fine-textured soils. Indeed, the observed reflection occurs some distance above the water table, depending on the shape of the capillary fringe. Under hydrostatic conditions, the shape corresponds to the soil\u2019s water retention curve [64]; otherwise, it can be relatively variable depending on the hydrodynamic conditions of the soil [168,175,177\u2013180]. The top of the capillary fringe is partly saturated and the bottom is fully saturated (the bottom is the water table). Thus, there is an SWC variation through the capillary fringe, and GPR wave velocity decreases from top to bottom (\u03b5r increases from top to bottom) [137,176,180]. Because of this heterogeneity, GPR wave reflection varies, along with the capillary fringe [168,171, 176]. The height of the capillary fringe varies with the texture, pore size, and pore size distribution [168,171,174,176,181]. In coarse grain soils (e.g., sand), the capillary height is less, and the contrast in \u03b5r between dry and saturated sand is sharp; consequently, the water table can be distinguished from easily GPR reflections [173,181,182]. Conversely, the capillarity is high in fine-grain soils. Therefore, it is difficult to distinguish the actual water table in clay soils due to low contrast at the interface, decreasing the accuracy of DTWT estimation using GPR [171,177\u2013180,182,183].\n3.2.6. Other Soil Properties\nOther than SWC, soil compaction, and soil salinity, GPR has been applied to estimate other soil properties, such as soil texture and clay content [184\u2013187] and SOM/soil organic carbon (SOC) [188\u2013192]. Soil profile stratigraphy studies focusing on other soil properties were carried out by Doolittle and Collins [193], Stroh et al. [194], Meadows et al. [184], Andr\u00e9 et al. [195], and Nov\u00e1kov\u00e1 et al. [196], and soil organic horizons were studied in particular by Winkelbauer et al. [197]. In agricultural soil studies, GPR is extensively used for SWC estimation, followed by the estimation of soil salinity, porosity, and bulk density, while other properties are currently being researched. In addition to soil properties and states, GPR estimates soil\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 2932 16 of 36\nhorizons, stratigraphy, and water table mapping. The estimation of these properties in the agricultural landscape using GPR will provide essential information needed for farmland management to support PA."

Therefore, without direct contact with the subsurface, EMI sensors measure the subsurface\u2019s \u03c3a and apparent magnetic susceptibility (\u03c7a) [29,198]. Three pathways of current flows are responsible for the soil \u03c3a (see Section 3.2.3). The interpretation of \u03c3a is complex and based on several soil properties such as soil salinity, SWC, soil porosity, bulk density (compaction), SOM, CEC, clay content, and temperature [147,150,153,199\u2013202]. \u03c3 increases with increasing temperature and is usually expressed at the reference temperature of 25 \u25e6C according to:\n\u03c325 = ft \u00d7 \u03c3t (8)\nft = 0.4470 + 1.4034e(\u2212t/26.815) (9)\n\u03c3measured at an actual temperature t (\u03c3t) can be converted into the \u03c3 at 25 \u25e6C (\u03c325) [150, 203]. In Equation (8), ft is the temperature conversion factor. Initially, EMI was used to measure soil \u03c3 and subsequently to estimate other soil properties such as SWC, soil texture (mainly the clay content), bulk density, SOM, CEC, and soil pH [29,202]. An EMI sensor primarily consists of two coils: a Tx coil and an Rx coil (Figure 6). The Tx sends the time-varying or frequency-varying alternative current through a coil. This alternating current produces a time-varying primary magnetic field, which interacts with the conductive subsurface to induce eddy currents. These eddy currents generate the secondary EM field. The amplitude and phase of the primary magnetic field (Hp) and the secondary magnetic field (Hs) are received by the Rx coil [204] (Figure 6). The ratio of the Hs and Hp is proportional to the subsurface \u03c3a under low induction number conditions according to the equation [204]:\n\u03c3a = 4( \u03c9\u00b50S 2 )( Hs Hp ) (10)\nwhere \u03c9 is the angular frequency, \u00b5o is the magnetic permeability of free space (4\u03c0 \u00d7 10\u22127 H/m), and S is inter-coil spacing (m).\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 17 of 38\nAlthough Equation (10) is the most widely used model for estimating the \u03c3 of soil from the EM field measurements, as it is i plemented in commercially available sensors, it relies o a series of simplifications, and its application requires specific calibration.\nSingle-to-multi-coil (MC) and single-to-multi-frequency (MF) are the commercially available EMI sensors used in agricultural and environmental fields (Figure 7). MC and MF sensors have different depth-sensitivity functions and different footprints and, therefore, characterize different soil volumes (Figure 8). MC EMI sensors have different coil separations between the Tx coil (usually one) and Rx coils (usually two or three) with one operating frequency to explore different integrated depths. In MF EMI sensors, one Tx coil and one Rx coil operate with different frequencies (Figure 8). The depth of investigation of MF sensors increases with decreasing frequency [206,207].\nBoth MC and MF EMI sensors can operate in horizontal dipole (EMh) (vertical coplanar) and vertical dipole (EMv) (horizontal coplanar) orientations and give different integrated depths of investigations (DOI) in each dipole or coil orientation (Figure 9). The EMh DOI is approximately 0.75 times the inter-coil spacing, while the EMv DOI is about 1.5 times the inter-coil spacing [204]. Current flow paths under different coil orientations (EMh and EMv) differ. The DOI of EMI sensors depends on field condition (height of operation, soil \u03c3, \u00b5, and stratigraphy), operating frequency, type of the sensor (MC or MF), and coil orientation (EMh or EMv). Even though theoretical DOI is based on homogeneous soil conditions, the actual DOI under heterogeneous field conditions (due to changing physical and chemical properties) can vary [147,208].\n. u rent flow paths in th lectromagnetic induction (EMI) technique (modified from De Carlo et al.

MC EMI sensors have different coil separations between the Tx coil (usually one) and Rx coils (usually two or three) with one operating frequency to explore different integrated depths. In MF EMI sensors, one Tx coil and one Rx coil operate with different frequencies (Figure 8). The depth of investigation of MF sensors increases with decreasing frequency [206,207].

The EMh DOI is approximately 0.75 times the inter-coil spacing, while the EMv DOI is about 1.5 times the inter-coil spacing [204]. Current flow paths under different coil orientations (EMh and EMv) differ. The DOI of EMI sensors depends on field condition (height of operation, soil \u03c3, \u00b5, and stratigraphy), operating frequency, type of the sensor (MC or MF), and coil orientation (EMh or EMv). Even though theoretical DOI is based on homogeneous soil conditions, the actual DOI under heterogeneous field conditions (due to changing physical and chemical properties) can vary [147,208].\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 2932 18 of 36\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 18 of 38\nFigure 7.

Soil Salinity\nThe spatial and temporal variability of soil salinity in the agricultural landscape can be assessed and monitored using EMI sensors by measuring \u03c3a [210\u2013212]. While some studies considered \u03c3a measured by EMI as a soil salinity indicator, others used \u03c3a to estimate actual soil salinity (e.g., \u03c3e) [212\u2013216]. However, the applications of EMI have limitations. The conversion of EMI measured \u03c3a into soil salinity is complex and needs to use different models (such as Rhoades\u2019 model (1976)) and regression equations [213, 217,218]. Furthermore, EMI applications that estimate soil salinity require site-specific calibration [213,219,220]. Several studies have been carried out to estimate soil salinity\u2019s spatial and temporal variation by developing simple regression models with \u03c3a. Diaz et al. [217] developed and compared two calibration methods, simple regression models derived from the design of the sensor: \u03c3a\u2013\u03c3e and \u03c3a\u2013\u03c31:5. The authors found that the \u03c3e estimations were more accurate when compared to the \u03c31:5 estimations using EMI measured \u03c3a. In another study by Doolittle et al. [218], simple linear regression (SLR) models were developed between \u03c3e measured in different depth intervals and \u03c3a measured using two different EMI instruments: EM38 (single frequency) and GEM300 (multi-frequency). Both instruments gave similar spatial and temporal variations, and in the 0\u20130.30 m depth interval, the coefficient of determination (R2) was >0.90 (p = 0.005) for both instruments [218]. Ganjegunte et al. [213] developed multiple linear regression (MLR) models to estimate the soil salinity (as \u03c3e) and sodium absorption ratio (SAR) in two study sites using \u03c3a. The authors found that the R2 values were 0.91 and 0.93 (p = 0.05) between the MLR model estimated and the measured \u03c3e, while the R2 values were 0.89 and 0.90 (p = 0.05) between the MLR model estimated and the measured SAR for two studied sites [213].\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 2932 19 of 36Remote Sens. 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 19 of 38\n4.2. Applications of Electromagnetic Induction in Soil Studies This section discusses the main applications of EMI in estimating soil properties and states such as SWC, soil compaction, soil salinity, soil texture, and SOM.\n4.2.1.

While some studies considered \u03c3a measured by EMI as a soil salinity indicator, others used \u03c3a to estimate actual soil salinity (e.g., \u03c3e) [212\u2013216].

The authors found that the \u03c3e estimations were more accurate when compared to the \u03c31:5 estimations using EMI measured \u03c3a. In another study by Doolittle et al. [218], simple linear regression (SLR) models were developed between \u03c3e measured in different depth intervals and \u03c3a measured using two different EMI instruments:\ni re 9.

Pathirana and L. Galagedara).\nGeostatistical methods such as ordinary kriging are often applied to observe and predict the spatial and temporal variation of soil salinity using easured \u03c3a data [212,214, 220]. A recent study researched variations in soil salinity using the time-lapse inversion of \u03c3a measured using an EMI sensor. The authors applied a 2D hydrological model, HYDRUS2D [221], by considering water contents and solute concentrations. The authors found that correlation (r) between \u03c3a and \u03c3e was 0.88 (p = 0.001) and showed the reliability of the EMI method in measuring soil salinity in salt-water-irrigated areas [205].\n4.2.2. Soil Water Content\nSWC and \u03c3w play a significant role in contributing to the variation of \u03c3a. Early stage research studies mapped the spatial or temporal variation of \u03c3a and SWC to investigate the influence of SWC and soil water dynamics on \u03c3a [199,222]. Based on the findings by the above researchers, subsequent studies have developed site-specific relationships between \u03c3a and SWC [151,152,223,224]. The latest research improved the modeling approaches [225\u2013228] to estimate the SWC from \u03c3a. Kachanoski et al. [222] conducted a field-scale experiment to determine the relationships between spatial variations of \u03c3a, SWC, and soil texture in areas with low soluble salts. The authors found that the spatial variation of the measured SWC correlated with \u03c3a (R2 = 0.77). An additional experiment evaluated the impact of air and soil temperature, as well as shallow hydraulic conditions such as SWC and water table depth, on the spatial\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 2932 20 of 36\nand temporal variation of \u03c3a, and the authors found that the \u03c3a was low under cold climatic conditions [199]. Additionally, the duration and intensity of rainfall and irrigation effects may influence the \u03c3a over a short period [199]. Using different soils, Brevick et al. [223] reported a linear relationship between \u03c3a and the SWC and found a significant impact of SWC on \u03c3a. Another study compared the spatial variability of \u03c3a under wet and dry conditions and evaluated the relationship between clay content and SWC [229]. The authors found significantly larger \u03c3a values during the wet days. The correlation between \u03c3a and SWC was found to be nearly two times greater in wet conditions (r = 0.54) than on dry days (r = 0.27) [229]. EMI surveys were also carried out to study \u03c3a variation under flood and drought (wetting and drying) conditions in a paddy field. Islam et al. [230] showed that flooding increased the stability of \u03c3a by reducing the micro-scale variability of \u03c3a due to the absence of soil moisture dynamics. The relationship between SWC and \u03c3a (MC and MF EMI sensors) was developed and evaluated in a managed podzolic soil [152]. Linear regression models were developed for SWC with MC and MF sensors separately. The authors found the highest predicting accuracy of SWC using \u03c3a measured by an MC EMI sensor (R2 = 0.79), rather than that of an MF sensor (R2 = 0.17) [152]. However, with a new calibration method, Robinet et al. [224] developed a non-linear relationship between SWC and \u03c3a measurements from an MC sensor for deeper depths, which was also influenced by \u03c3w. Hezarjaribi and Sourell [231] used electrical resistivity and EMI techniques (EM-38) to develop site-specific relationships between \u03c3a and the total available water content within the upper 0.60 m of the soil profile. According to the developed relationships, the resistivity technique gave a higher correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.77) for the total available water content. In contrast, EMI provided a lower correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.56, and R2 = 0.35 for vertical and horizontal dipoles, respectively) [231]. However, Huth and Poulton [232] studied the soil water extraction pattern of a 0.90 m soil profile with \u03c3a and found a good correlation between SWC and \u03c3a (R2 = 0.93). Soil water distribution estimations in wheat [200] and cotton [233] fields were carried out using EMI sensors which showed an accurate estimation of SWC (R2 > 0.70) using \u03c3a measurements within the root zone. Altdorff et al. [151] determined the accuracy of the correlation between \u03c3a measured using an MC EMI sensor and SWC measured using TDR under different agronomic treatments (dairy manure, inorganic nitrogen, and phosphorous). The major finding of their study was that the \u03c3a\u2013SWC correlation varied both spatially and temporally and was dependent on several soil properties, such as soil texture, bulk density, and site conditions, potentially due to the changes in ionic strength under different agronomic treatments [151]. Advanced electromagnetic models, combined with inversion techniques and multioffset measurements, can be used to reconstruct vertical conductivity profiles from the EMI measurements of soil \u03c3a. This method allows for the estimation of the SWC at specific depths using mathematical models applied to the depth-specific \u03c3a values [225\u2013228]. The spatiotemporal variability of SWC in irrigated maize fields was assessed using the probabilistic inversion of time-lapse \u03c3a data [225]. The authors showed that the time-lapse method is beneficial to use when identifying the spatiotemporal variability of the SWC and soil water dynamics [225]. In another study, \u03c3a related to SWC and potato tuber yield and established a two-layer model for \u03c3a with a mathematical model [226]. The least-square inversion algorithm was applied to determine the \u03c3a of soil layers to predict the SWC and spatiotemporal management zones during wet and dry conditions [228]. In this study, EMI-estimated SWC compared well with neutron probe measurements for wet and dry conditions, with Pearson correlations of 0.74 and 0.95, respectively [228]. No empirical or theoretical model or relationship has been developed to estimate SWC accurately from \u03c3a. The relationship between \u03c3a and SWC depends on several soil properties, states, and specific field conditions; thus, site-specific calibrations are required [234\u2013236]. Site-specific empirical relationships between the SWC and \u03c3a are reported as being linear in most of the literature [201,223,236,237]. At the same time, a few\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 2932 21 of 36\nstudies have shown that the relationship changes to being non-linear when the variability of the SWC is high [222,224,234]. However, SWC maps could be developed using \u03c3a to understand the spatial and temporal variability pattern of the SWC, being correlated weakly, moderately, or strongly with \u03c3a [151,152,208,233,238\u2013241].\n4.2.3. Bulk Density and Soil Compaction\nThe potential of \u03c3a as a proxy to estimate the spatial and temporal variation of soil compaction/bulk density has been studied previously as \u03c3a is a function of soil compaction/bulk density [47]. Previous research showed that \u03c3a increases as soil compaction increases [242\u2013244]. Galambo\u0161ov\u00e1 et al. [244] evaluated the potential of the EMI method or sensors to determine the compacted and non-compacted areas in silty clay soils and observed higher \u03c3a values in compacted areas (r = 0.66) than in non-compacted areas [244]. Al-Gaadi et al. [245] evaluated the potential of \u03c3a measured from EMI to estimate soil compaction by considering the influence of SWC. The authors found that \u03c3a measurement can predict soil compaction under low SWC conditions (below 7%) in sandy soil [245]. Besson et al. [246] discovered no clear correlation between soil compaction and \u03c3a in newly plowed land due to significant variation in soil properties such as SWC. A recent study also found that there was no good correlation between \u03c3a with bulk density and penetration resistance, even though the study showed a positive correlation (r = 0.61) between \u03c3a and clay content [247]. The authors suggested that the variability in clay content covers comparatively slight variation effects of soil compaction, and that subsurface heterogeneity (due to stones) would also affect \u03c3a measurements [247].\n4.2.4. Other Soil Properties\nOther than SWC, soil salinity, and compaction, \u03c3a measured using EMI has been used to estimate and map the spatial and temporal variation of soil texture and clay content [201,229,247\u2013251], SOM or SOC [191,201,248,249,251,252], CEC [250], and soil pH [248,249,251].\n4.2.5. Apparent Magnetic Susceptibility\nMost EMI applications in soil studies are related to \u03c3a measurements; however, \u03c7a also has the potential to be used in relation to soil properties and processes. However, very few soil studies have been conducted using \u03c7a (in-phase data), which is simultaneously measured by commonly available EMI sensors. The \u03c7a of soil is determined by the number of magnetic minerals present and is primarily controlled by magnetite and maghemite concentrations [253]. Similar to \u03c3a, \u03c7a is also influenced by soil layering, porosity, saturation, texture, SOM, and natural and anthropogenic features [254\u2013256]. Using metal targets, Sadatcharam et al. [254] studied the depth sensitivity of \u03c7a using MC and MF EMI sensors. Shirzaditabar and Heck [256] studied soil drainage characteristics of soil profiles using \u03c7a under different drainage conditions; the authors found that the \u03c7a values in poorly drained soil profiles were lower than in well-drain soil profiles. McLachlan et al. [257] studied physicochemical properties, such as SOM, nitrogen, CEC, and pH, using both \u03c3a and \u03c7a, reporting a potential relationship between \u03c7a and CEC and SOM. In soil studies related to agriculture, the EMI method is used in various applications. Based on the influence of several soil properties and states of \u03c3a, the relationships with interrelated soil properties are complex. Additionally, the use of the EMI method provides \u03c3a and \u03c7a simultaneously; therefore, the application range in soil studies can be expanded with future research."

            "text": "Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and electromagnetic induction (EMI) have been successfully applied in soil studies to assess various soil properties and their spatial and temporal variability. Compared to traditional methods, the non-destructive nature of GPR and EMI offers several advantages in terms of their application to the agricultural landscape, such as their ability to make repeated measurements, save on labor, and provide more extensive spatial coverage (in terms of both vertical and horizontal spatial variability) with geo-referenced data. Compared to the traditional point scale measurements, GPR and EMI applications in soil studies have a larger sampling volume (including a higher penetration depth and wider footprint), which is primarily controlled by the frequency, antenna separation, and coil orientation. Thus, mapping soil proxies related to EMI (apparent electrical conductivity: \u03c3a) and GPR (dielectric permittivity: \u03b5r) techniques in the agricultural landscape can predict and map the spatiotemporal variability of soil properties and states. The possession of this information is fundamental to obtain the information required to determine the management zones in support of precision agriculture (PA), where the application rate, amount, and timing of the agricultural inputs and their management can be optimized. Soil water content (SWC) and electrical conductivity (\u03c3) are the two main soil parameters influencing GPR and EMI proxies. GPR is widely used for SWC estimation and\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 2932 26 of 36\nis well-established with different data collection and processing methods; these include direct ground wave velocity, reflected wave velocity, transillumination method, and full waveform inversion, and their application to different soil types under different conditions. The application of EMI is comparatively broad as it has been tested for estimating SWC, soil salinity, and a few other properties. Furthermore, some EMI studies have considered several interrelated soil properties and states at the same time. The estimation of other soil properties such as soil compaction, soil texture/clay content, soil organic matter/soil organic carbon, soil pH, and cation exchange capacity, in addition to soil hydraulic properties such as water holding capacity, infiltration capacity, water repellency, and hydraulic conductivity, using both techniques is therefore warranted. Additionally, the responses of GPR and EMI techniques are favored for different soil properties, even though all these properties are directly or indirectly related to each other. Future directions of EMI and GPR require a focus on the estimation and mapping of many soil properties simultaneously within the agricultural landscape to support applications in PA. For example, the influence of different soil properties on EM field strengths (EMI) and wave propagation (GPR) under heterogeneous and variable soil conditions such as alternate wetting and drying, plowing and compaction, and high and low saline conditions should be investigated. Most research studies on advancing data analysis and the interpretation of these two techniques have been conducted under control conditions and through modeling approaches by only considering one or a few variables at a time. However, when it comes to the actual field application of these two techniques, the situation is more complex and heterogeneous under natural and managed conditions. Thus, the combined effect of different soil properties and states on the proxies of GPR and EMI should be further investigated under variable field conditions. This approach will provide the necessary information to enhance the prediction accuracy of soil properties and states and their variability in both spatial and temporal scales within the agricultural landscape. Prediction accuracy can be further enhanced using advanced modeling approaches such as artificial intelligence by incorporating heterogeneous (both temporally stable and variable) field conditions. The main disadvantages of these two techniques are the difficulty of the real-time data processing and interpretation of most of the properties. However, advanced, computerbased commercial solutions are progressively becoming available, such as gprSense (http:// www.gprsense.com, accessed on 26 December 2022) for real-time GPR full-wave inversion, in addition to SWAT (soil, water, and topography) maps (https://swatmaps.com, accessed on 25 March 2023) for agronomic decision-making in agricultural landscapes, such as that regarding variable-rate fertilizer, seed, soil amendment, pesticide applications, and precision water management. Both the GPR and EMI techniques are EM techniques, even though the operating principles of the techniques are quite different. Therefore, integrating these two techniques can provide the information needed to advance the PA by assessing several soil properties at once by amending the negative aspect of one technique with that of the other. Thus, the future direction of EMI and GPR applications in soil studies to support PA needs to focus on research questions for potential integration by considering both techniques\u2019 similarities, differences, and advantages and disadvantages.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, S.P. and L.G.; methodology, S.P., S.L. and L.G.; software, S.P.; validation, S.L., M.C., M.K., C.S. and L.G.; formal analysis, S.P.; investigation, S.P.; data curation, S.P. and S.L.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, S.P.; writing\u2014review and editing, S.L., M.C., M.K., C.S. and L.G.; visualization, S.P., S.L. and L.G.; supervision, L.G., C.S., S.L. and M.C.; project administration, L.G.; funding acquisition, L.G.
