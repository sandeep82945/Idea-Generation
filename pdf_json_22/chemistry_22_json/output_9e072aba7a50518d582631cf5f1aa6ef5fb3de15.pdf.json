Tilve *\nA domino condensation\u2013cyclization method is developed to synthesize indolizidine alkaloids using\na P4O10/TfOH reagent system without the employment of either a catalyst or solvent. The use of a few aliphatic and aromatic dicarboxylic acids is shown along with various primary amines. This method is\nsuitable for synthesizing pyrrolo[2,1-a]isoquinolines, pyrido[2,1-a]isoquinolines, and isoindolo[1,2-a]\nisoquinolinones in excellent yields. When phthalic acid is used, a workup with either NaBH4 or a saturated NaHCO3 solution provided 12b-H or 12b-OH isoindolo[1,2-a]isoquinolinones, respectively.\nIndolizidine alkaloids are structurally important molecules that belong to the broader class of natural products.1 These indolizidine alkaloids are isolated as lysine-derived metabolites from various animal and plant sources, like higher plants, invertebrates, vertebrates, fungi, and bacteria.2 With their core structure of a fused six- and ve-membered ring system with a bridgehead nitrogen atom, indolizidine compounds constitute 25\u201330% of all alkaloids.3 Benzoindolizidine alkaloids that contain benzene rings fused to one of the indolizidine rings are also known in nature. A few selected examples are shown in Fig. 1. For instance, crispine contains a benzene ring attached to the indolizidine piperidine ring. Jamtine and erythraline, in addition to the benzene ring, have a six membered cyclohexene ring attached to indolizidine pyrrolidine. In elaeocarpaceae, a phenanthrene ring is attached to the indolizidine piperidene ring. In nuevamine, a benzene ring is attached to both the indolizidine piperidine and pyrrolidine rings. Alkaloids like lamellarin, which are well studied for their wide range of biological activity, contain an indolizidine ring fused to a benzene and a coumarin ring, making them unique in the indolizidine family.\nAmong current pharmaceuticals, 40% are derived from or inspired by natural products.4 Scientists have extensively worked on the construction of indolizidine core structures from various synthons.5 The indolizidine compound class shows a wide range of promising biological activities such as cytotoxicity,6 antibacterial activity, antiviral activity,7 antioxidant activity,8 antileishmanial activity,9 antinociceptive activity,10 etc.\ny, Taleigao, Goa, 403206, India.

Moreover, practicing chemists usually require two or more steps to construct the indolizidine ring core from different substrates under various conditions.13 Ramanathan et al. elaborated a precise methodological syntheses of isoindoloisoquinolinones, pyrroloisoquinolinones, and benzo[a]quinolizinones using TfOH.

They synthesized a library of such compounds and even demonstrated the syntheses of many naturally occurring compounds in their racemic form. They have synthesized ( )-crispine A, ( )-trolline/oleracein E, ( )-erythrabine, and ( )-mescalotam from their respective imides in excellent yields. Later, they applied an iminium ion cyclization strategy to unsymmetrical succinimides to synthesize 1- or 2-alkylsubstituted pyrroloisoquinolinones and indolizinoindolones.14\nThe present study describes a one-pot protocol for constructing an indolizidine ring system from 2-arylethanamines and dicarboxylic acids."

            "text": "We examined the reagents required for a reaction between primary amines and dicarboxylic acids and settled on the use of phosphorus pentaoxide (P4O10) to carry out the reaction. Many reports have focused on the cyclization of 1- phenethylpyrrolidine-2,5-dione via an acyliminium ion. Thus, our methodology also depends on a one-pot formation of an acyliminium ion followed by its cyclization and reduction.\nInitially, a model reaction between 1 and succinic acid 2a was carried out in the presence of 2.5 equivalents of P4O10 in reuxing toluene (Table 1, entry 1). It did not cyclize to form tricyclic compound 3 but instead formed imide 4. Further reuxing in dry xylene, to test whether the formation of 3 was temperature-dependent, also failed to give the desired product\nTable 1 Optimization of the reagents\nEntry Reaction conditions (1)a Time\nYield\n3 4\n1 P4O10, dry toluene, D 12 h n.d. b 63% 2 P4O10, dry xylene, D 12 h n.d. 65% 3 Eaton's reagent, rt 8 h 28% n.d. 4 7.5 wt% P4O10/TfOH, rt 6 h 45% n.d. 5 7.5 wt% P4O10/TfOH, 60 C 6 h 65% n.d. 6 8.3 wt% P4O10/TfOH, 100 C 2 h 79% n.d.\na The reaction was performed with homoveratrylamine 1 (1.5 mmol) and succinic acid 2a (1 mmol) for the time periods indicated; this was followed by reduction with NaBH4 (1 mmol) in MeOH at rt.\nb n.d. \u2013 not detected.\n17702 | RSC Adv., 2022, 12, 17701\u201317705\n(Table 1, entry 2). The use of Eaton's reagent (7.5 wt% P4O10 in MsOH) has been reported for dehydration and cyclization reactions in many cases.15 So, in freshly prepared Eaton's reagent at room temperature another reaction was set between 1 and 2a (Table 1, entry 3). Tricyclic product 3 was formed, aer reduction, in a 28% yield and no imide 4 was isolated. The acidity of the reagents or the temperature are factors that could also affect the cyclization. Thus, with the same 7.5 wt% proportion of P4O10, we prepared a mixture of P4O10 in TfOH and carried out the reaction at room temperature (Table 1, entry 4). This reaction produced compound 3 in a 45% yield aer the reduction process. With the same mixture of P4O10 and TfOH at 60 C, a 20% increase in yield was found in comparison to the previous attempt (Table 1, entry 5). When the wt% of the P4O10 in TfOH mixture was increased to 8.3 wt% and the temperature was increased to 100 C, we could obtain the cyclized compound, aer reduction using sodium borohydride, in a 79% yield in just 2 h (Table 1, entry 6).\nAer successfully making 3a, the reactions of other primary amines with succinic acid and glutaric acid were conducted to synthesize tricyclic structures (Scheme 1). The reaction of mono and trimethoxy phenethylamines with succinic acid proceeded smoothly to furnish compounds 3b and 3c in 74% and 75% yields, respectively. Compound 3c is a naturally occurring compound, mescalotam, for which no biological activity study has been reported to date. The indole-containing heterocyclic amine tryptamine, a precursor for naturally occurring compound harmicine, was reacted with succinic acid to afford 3d in an 81% yield. Instead of succinic acid 2a, the ve carbon dicarboxylic acid, glutaric acid 2b, was incorporated into our methodology to assess its reactivity. The reaction of 2b with homoveratrylamine and tryptamine gave quinolizidine alkaloids 3e and 3f in 74% and 79% yields, respectively.\nFurthermore, these compounds were, using reduction and demethylation reactions, utilized to synthesize naturally occurring compounds such as ( )-crispine A, ( )-trolline/ oleracein E, and ( )-harmicine. The amide group in compound 3a was reduced using lithium aluminium hydride to get ( )-crispine A 5 in an overall yield of 66% (Scheme 2). Likewise, 3a was demethylated to its dihydroxy form using\nScheme 1 Syntheses of indolizidine and quinolizidine alkaloids.\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

We successfully synthesized 7 from compound 3c in an 89% yield by complete demethylation using the same method employed to synthesize ( )-trolline/oleracein E (Scheme 4). Using the method employed to synthesize ( )-crispine A, we obtained ( )-harmicine 8 from its amide precursor 3d in an overall yield of 74% starting from tryptamine (Scheme 5).\nIn addition, aromatic 1,2-dicarboxylic acids were also reacted with primary amines using the 8.3 wt% P4O10/TfOH reagent system. Four aryl/heteroaryl ethylamines were treated with phthalic acid 2c and heated in an 8.3 wt% P4O10/TfOH mixture at 100 C followed by reduction of the subsequent iminium ion to produce the nal adducts (Scheme 6). Compound 9awas prepared from homoveratrylamine 1 and phthalic acid 2c in an 89% yield. Whereas the monomethoxy compound 9b and the unsubstituted analog 9c were prepared successfully from 3-methoxyphenethylamine and phenylethylamine in 85% and 84% yields, respectively. In addition to simple aryl compounds, a heteroaryl derivative with a pentacyclic ring structure 9d was obtained from tryptamine and\nScheme 4 Synthesis of trihydroxy derivative of mescalotam.\nScheme 5 Total synthesis of ( )-harmicine.\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nphthalic acid 2c in an 87% yield. Successful incorporation of a hydride ion at the 12b-position furnished all the desired isoindoloisoquinolinone compounds successfully.\nAer accomplishing the target molecules, we synthesized their 12b-hydroxy analogs via a saturated sodium bicarbonate workup (Scheme 7). The respective aryl/heteroaryl ethylamines 11a, 11b, 11c, and 11d were condensed with two different phthalic acid derivatives. When condensed with simple phthalic acid 2c, four 12b-hydroxy isoindoloisoquinolinone derivatives, 10a, 10b, 10c, and 10d, were prepared from their corresponding amines using just a simple basic workup. Novel analogs like 10e, 10f, and 10g were prepared using 4-nitrophthalic acid 2d. When 2d was fused with homoveratrylamine, 10e was obtained in a 91% yield. The reaction of 3-methoxyphenethyl amine went smoothly to form 10f in an 89% yield. Also, tryptaminederived 12b-hydroxy analog 10g was synthesized in a slightly higher yield than the other amines.\nA speculative mechanism is proposed in Scheme 8. The combination of P4O10/TfOH produces triic anhydride which induces the activation of the diacid. The resulting mixed anhydride is attacked by the amine to form the amide acid. The amide acid is further activated by triic anhydride to form the imide via a mixed anhydride. The imide undergoes a Bischler\u2013 Napieralski reactionmediated by triic anhydride. Reduction of the resulting salt delivers the nal product.\nScheme 7 Syntheses of 12b-hydroxyisoindolo[2,1-a]isoquinolinone alkaloids.\nRSC Adv., 2022, 12, 17701\u201317705 | 17703\nScheme 8 Plausible mechanism for the formation of pyrrolo[2,1-a] isoquinolinone.\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

The reactions proceed via single pot domino reactions between phenethylamine derivatives and aliphatic and aromatic dicarboxylic acids in the presence of an 8.3 wt% mixture of P4O10/ TfOH. In total, seventeen 12b-H and 12b-OH derivatives of pyrrolo[2,1-a]isoquinoline and isoindolo[1,2-a]isoquinoline alkaloids are synthesized in very good yields. The utility of this methodology was demonstrated by synthesizing naturally occurring compounds such as, ( )-crispine A, ( )-trolline/ oleracein E, ( )-mescalotam and ( )-harmicine from commercially available synthons. A novel trihydroxy derivative of mescalotam was also synthesized successfully. Compounds such as CRR-203, CRR-204 were also synthesized in excellent yields."
