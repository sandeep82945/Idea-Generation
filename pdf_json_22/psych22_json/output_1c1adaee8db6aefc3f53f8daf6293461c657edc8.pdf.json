At perimenopause in the mid-forties, estrogen levels decline to remain persistently low after menopause. This period is hypothesized to increase relapse risk and reduce antipsychotic effectiveness in preventing relapse. Study Design: The cohort of persons with schizophrenia/ schizoaffective disorder was identified from Finnish nationwide registers (N = 61\u00a0889) and stratified by sex and age <45 vs. \u226545 years. Hospitalizations for psychosis were defined per 5-year age group during the follow-up 1996\u2013 2017. Risk of psychosis hospitalization (Adjusted Hazard Ratio, aHR) was assessed using within-individual design, by comparing antipsychotic monotherapy use to nonuse periods in the same individuals for seven dose categories in defined daily doses (DDDs/day). Results: Starting at age 45\u201350, women were consistently more often hospitalized for psychosis than their male peers. Women \u226545 had significantly higher aHRs than women <45 at antipsychotic monotherapy >0.6 DDDs/day, and than men at >1.1 DDDs/day. This female-specific age-dependent decrease in effectiveness was present for clozapine doses >0.6 DDDs/ day, olanzapine doses >1.4 DDDs/day, and for specific doses of quetiapine (0.9\u20131.1 DDDs/day) and risperidone (0.6\u20130.9 DDDs/day). Conclusions: While younger women have a lower risk of relapse and generally need a lower antipsychotic dose to prevent rehospitalization than men, antipsychotic effectiveness declines in women after the age of 45. Starting in mid-forties, older women with SSD should be regarded as a vulnerable group that deserve special attention.\nKey words: relapse/psychosis/menopause/sex/age"

            "text": "Every woman with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder (schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, SSD) will eventually face a period of lasting impact on their endogenous estrogen production: menopause. The onset of menopause is defined as the cessation of natural menstrual cycles for 12 months and on average occurs at the age of 49 world-wide, with European mean age at menopause of 50.5.1 In the years preceding menopause (i.e. perimenopause), menstrual cycles become irregular with longer periods between menses and ovarian hormone production starts to decline.2\nThroughout the life stages of women with SSD, an association between estrogen levels and disease severity is present. At the first psychotic episode, women tend to function better than men, a sex difference that has been attributed to estrogen\u2019s protective effects.3 Ovarian hormones strongly impact brain and behavior of women, both in physiological and in pathological states. Estrogens support cognition and maintain high cognitive functioning under chronic stress.4 They act as antioxidants, increase neuroplasticity, and facilitate neurotransmission.5 As a result, women with natural menstrual cycles, on average have more severe psychotic symptoms and more admissions for psychosis during low estrogenic phases, which occurs preceding and during menses, compared to high estrogen periods surrounding ovulation.6 During pregnancy, high estrogen states are associated with relatively mild symptom severity, while the sharp drop in sex hormone levels after delivery forms the prelude of more severe symptoms.7 After menopause, estrogen levels remain low which is associated with a deterioration in the clinical course.8 Therefore, women with SSD have sex-specific psychiatric needs, that differ according to their life stage.9,10\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /schizophreniabulletin/article/49/1/136/6748974 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 17 January 2024\nEstrogens also affect pharmacokinetics of antipsychotic medication.11 They inhibit the liver enzyme cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 1A2, which metabolizes many antipsychotic drugs, especially olanzapine and clozapine. Lower activity of this enzyme leads to higher blood levels of these antipsychotics. A notable exception is quetiapine, which is mainly metabolized by an enzyme facilitated by estrogens, CYP3A4. Risperidone is metabolized by both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, of which the latter is not dependent on estrogen levels. In addition, estrogens increase dopamine (D2) receptor sensitivity in the ventral tegmentum, which results in a higher D2 receptor occupancy of antipsychotics in women of fertile age, as compared to men, at equal plasma concentrations.12\nAfter menopause, women with SSD lose these neuroprotective and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects, as estrogen levels of postmenopausal women are no higher than those of men. While the process of aging causes a relative increase in plasma levels of antipsychotic medications in both sexes,13 the steep drop in natural estrogen production causes important additional changes in the CYP-metabolism of women. Low estrogen levels lead to lower activity of the CYP3A4 enzyme, while it leaves the CYP1A2 enzyme more active. The result may be that after menopause, plasma concentrations of specific drugs change. Due to the absence of estrogens, olanzapine and clozapine are metabolized more rapidly while that of quetiapine is slowed down.13 At the brain level, animal models of menopause show that dopamine receptor sensitivity declines in this life phase.14 This would suggest lower effectiveness of antipsychotic medication, especially of clozapine and olanzapine in postmenopausal women as compared to premenopausal women, but also as compared to men of similar age. Although the postmenopausal era is recognized as a period of increasing symptom severity, reduced efficacy of antipsychotic drugs and increased need for care,8,15 there is a remarkable paucity on quantitative data on this vulnerable period that all women with schizophrenia will experience.8 We here provide detailed, quantitative data on life-stage dependent clinical changes occurring in women with SSD, using an intra-individual design to prevent confounding. The main aims of this study are:\n1. To compare hospitalization rates for psychosis between women and men with SSD at different age groups. 2. To compare effectiveness of commonly used antipsychotic monotherapies in terms of dose-dependent psychosis hospitalization risk in men and women before and after the age of 45, as a proxy for menopausal status in women.16"

The lower effectiveness for older women was most pronounced for clozapine, where these women had significantly more rehospitalizations at all doses compared to younger women. For olanzapine, older women did particularly poorly at the higher dose groups. Quetiapine and risperidone appear to be less effective than olanzapine and clozapine in preventing hospitalization in all age and sex groups. Differences between the sex and age groups were smaller for quetiapine and risperidone, with older women doing significantly worse only at daily doses between 0.9 and 1.1, and above 1.6 for quetiapine, and daily doses between 0.6 and 0.9 for risperidone.\nThe timing when women start to show higher hospitalization rates than men coincides with perimenopause, usually starting in the mid-forties, when menses becomes less frequent and natural estrogen production declines. Exact menopausal dates were not known from the female participants. In Europe, menopause on average occurs at 49 years of age, but smoking and less physical activity tend to lower the mean age of menopause,1 while obesity, which is also common among women with SSD, tends to increase the age at menopause.1 We therefore do not expect significant differences in age at menopause for women with SSD. During the years of menopausal transition (i.e. perimenopause), the lower estrogen production not only affects the reproductive system but also the central nervous system,21 which worsens the course\nof neuropsychiatric disorders including psychosis. The sex difference in hospitalizations after age 45 may partly be caused by reduced efficacy of antipsychotic medication to prevent relapse in women with low estrogen levels. Menopause also affects the metabolism of selected antipsychotics, which could explain the antipsychoticspecific effects reported in this study. With much lower average estrogen levels after menopause, the induction of CYP1A2 decreases, leading to more rapid conversion of antipsychotics that are mainly metabolized by this enzyme (i.e. clozapine and olanzapine). This pharmacokinetic effect could explain the pronounced effect of age in women using clozapine. Our findings oppose an earlier study reporting that female sex was associated with more frequent admissions and lower responsiveness to clozapine.22 We showed that clozapine is similarly or even more effective in women before the age of 45 as compared to men of all ages. The earlier study did not account for age categories as a proxy for menopausal status, while this could have had a major impact on their conclusions. We found significant differences in effectiveness between younger and older women using olanzapine only for the higher dose groups. For olanzapine, the risk of overdosing women is very high before menopause,11 as blood levels are not monitored routinely as they are for clozapine, which could have affected the results.\nQuetiapine is metabolized by CYP3A4, which becomes somewhat less active after menopause, potentially\nFig. 2.

Risperidone is dependent on both CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, but its metabolite paliperidone is also active, so that changes in metabolism do not affect efficacy for relapse prevention. However, we did find lower effectiveness of quetiapine and risperidone after presumed menopause specifically for the optimal doses of these antipsychotics for younger women (0.9\u20131.1 DDD and 0.6\u20130.9 DDD, respectively), which may indicate that pharmacodynamic effects of estrogen decline (i.e. decreasing dopamine receptor sensitivity) may be more important than pharmacokinetic effects.\nThe effect of age as a proxy for menopause on women with SSD has been described before, but not in such a large cohort and in such great detail. This relative paucity in studies on menopausal women with SSD was recently mentioned by Gonza\u0301lez-Rodri\u0301guez et al.8 who found only 49 studies on this topic. This group did important research on menopause themselves and showed a negative effect of time since menopause on antipsychotic response in a sample of 64 postmenopausal women with SSD,23 which parallels our finding of increasing women: men ratio for relapse risk across the older age groups.\nShlomi-Polachek et al.24 compared the frequency hospitalizations in a sample of 5411 women and men. Women younger than 45 years had lower proportions of voluntary hospitalizations than men in the same age group (33.5% vs. 66.5%), while women older than 55 years had higher proportions of hospitalizations than men (57.2% vs. 42.8%). The age group 45\u201355 was excluded in this study. This study also assessed prescribed drug doses for intramuscular risperidone (n = 280) and clozapine (n = 192). Women younger than 45 years were prescribed similar doses of intramuscular risperidone and lower doses of clozapine (345.8 vs. 380.2\u00a0mg/day) and women older than 55 were prescribed higher doses of intramuscular risperidone (44.8 vs. 34.4\u00a0 mg/2 weeks) and clozapine (164.3 vs. 154.5\u00a0mg/day) than men in the same age group. Seeman et al.25 carried out a survey of schizophrenia patients who were treated by the same psychiatrist over a 3-year period. The sample consisted of 43 women and 58 men. When stratified by age, women under 40 were prescribed lower doses than age-matched men, while women over age 40 were given higher doses than men.\nBoth studies indicate that the deteriorating clinical course of women of postmenopausal age may have prompted their physicians to increase the dose. This dose increase is an understandable reaction to a declining clinical status, but it is unsure if this strategy is successful, as we showed that at higher levels, the effectiveness of antipsychotics in preventing relapse in postmenopausal women is very low, especially for quetiapine and risperidone. While relapse may not be prevented with higher doses, the risk of side-effects will increase, which is particularly worrisome for postmenopausal women as\nthey are most vulnerable for cardiovascular and metabolic side-effects.26 A better strategy could be to provide hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) or augmentation with a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), which mimics the effect of estrogens in the brain.27 The SERM raloxifene has proven to ameliorate positive, negative and cognitive symptoms and may even allow a lower dose of prescribed antipsychotics by improving treatment efficacy.9,28 While both raloxifene and HRT slightly increase the risk for thrombo-embolic complications, raloxifene reduces the risk for breast cancer, while HRT increases this risk.29 Age for starting HRT or raloxifene is critical, as beneficial effects of estrogenic therapy are probably absent when started several years after menopause.30 As estrogen levels and clinical course already start to decline several years before actual menopause, mid-forties may be the optimal age for such preventive actions."

            "text": "A clear strength of this study is its large sample size and the naturalistic design, which enables translation to realworld settings in similar populations. Importantly, analyses were conducted in a within-individual design where each person (within each age group) acts as their own control, minimizing confounding by selection. However, within subject analysis also has its limitations, as we could only include patients with a variation in exposure and experiencing relapse in pharmacological treatment. In addition, we used hospitalizations with psychotic disorders as the main diagnosis at discharge, thereby excluding hospitalizations for other reasons (e.g. somatic disorders), but the exact reasons for hospitalization were not available. The permanent decline of estrogens is a common denominator of women of menopausal age and the need for rehospitalization may have been triggered by combinations of potential consequences of this phenomenon (e.g. lower effectiveness of antipsychotics, psychotic exacerbations or menopause-associated stresses). Other limitations concern the use of age as an estimation of menopausal status and the absence of information on clinical outcome measures. Individual characteristics that influence drug efficacy, such as bodymass index, smoking status and protein binding of the antipsychotics were unavailable. In addition, aging may come with other sex-specific changes that are difficult to disentangle from menopause effects and may be intertwined with its hormone-related changes (for a review, see H\u00e4gg and Jylh\u00e4v\u00e431). In future studies, assessment of follicle-stimulation hormone levels would be helpful for estimating menopausal status, as estrogen levels have strong circadian variation. Finnish mental health care may resemble those of other European countries, Canada and Oceania, but may be different from that in US and non-western countries,32 which limits the generalizability of our findings.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /schizophreniabulletin/article/49/1/136/6748974 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 17 January 2024"

            "heading": "Conclusion",
            "text": "We showed that women with SSD aged 45 and older consistently need more hospitalizations for psychosis than their male peers. The effectiveness of antipsychotic drugs in preventing rehospitalizations for psychosis was much lower in women older than 45, as compared to women below this age, but also as compared to male peers. The most pronounced sex-specific effect of age was observed for clozapine, for higher doses of olanzapine, and for optimal doses of quetiapine and risperidone.\nIt is important to recognize that perimenopause is a critical period during which symptoms increase, while the effectiveness of antipsychotics declines as a consequence of estrogen deficiency. These processes are likely to reinforce each other, together leading to a major increase in relapse risk. Dose increase is a logical clinical response to symptom deterioration but may not be the best strategy, as effectiveness of antipsychotics in women over 45 was very low for higher dose ranges. Earlier studies showed that estrogenic treatment (either HRT or raloxifene) reduces symptoms and increases the effectiveness of antipsychotic medication, but also provide protection against cognitive decline, cardiovascular comorbidity, and osteoporosis, in postmenopausal women with SSD.27,33\u201335 As estrogen decline and deterioration of the clinical course already start in the mid-forties, this is the optimal age to consider such preventive actions."
