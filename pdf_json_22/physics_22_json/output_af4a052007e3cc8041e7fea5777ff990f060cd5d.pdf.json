    "abstractText": "Designing an ultra-wideband array antenna for fifth generation (5G) is challenging for the antenna designing community because of the highly fragmented electromagnetic spectrum. To overcome bandwidth limitations, several millimeter-wave bands for 5G and beyond applications are considered; as a result, many antenna arrays have been proposed during the past decades. This paper aims to explore recent developments and techniques regarding a specific type of phased array antenna used in 5G applications, called current sheet array (CSA). CSA consists of capacitively coupled elements placed over a ground plane, with mutual coupling intentionally introduced in a controlled manner between the elements. CSA concept evolved and led to the realization of new array antennas with multiple octaves of bandwidth. In this review article, we provide a comprehensive overview of the existing works in this line of research. We analyze and discuss various aspects of the proposed array antennas with the wideband and wide-scan operation. Additionally, we discuss the significance of the phased array antenna in 5G communication. Moreover, we describe the current research challenges and future directions for CSA-based phased array antennas.",

            "text": "In less than a decade, 5G has transformed from merely a distant concept to reality, with wireless access and services beginning to roll out across the globe. No doubt, 5G is not an evaluation but a big revolution, unlike predecessor generations. 5G mobile networks are an effective solution for the bandwidth scarcity led by the exponential growth of mobile devices and the ever-increasing demand for mobile applications [1,2]. In 5G, gigabits per second data rates are achieved by utilizing the unused millimeter-wave bands [3,4]. 5G technology will contain a range of networks to fulfill typical requirements of end-users such as voice, video, and data, along with the additional capabilities of seeming less connectivity across devices, machines, vehicles, sensors, and so on [5,6]. However, achieving the full potential of 5G requires end-to-end network transformations [7,8]. A phased array antenna is a crucial ingredient to unlock the true potential of 5G technology by attaining wider bandwidths and extended coverage, and better capacity at the millimeter-wave spectrum [9,10]. Although millimeter-wave systems can be relatively easily deployed for short-range indoor setups, many challenges are involved during their use for outdoor scenarios [11,12]. Many limitations should be resolved to realize millimeterwave-based architecture, such as propagation loss, rain fades, atmospheric absorption, and high attenuation and shadowing [13,14].\nSensors 2022, 22, 3329. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22093329 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 3329 2 of 25\nNonetheless, cell sites at millimeter-wave frequencies can cope with path loss, using antenna arrays with a large number of elements for steering multiple beams for superior coverage and capacity. Conventional base stations usually have between two to eight antennas, and this number can be in hundreds in 5G with antennas to form massive MIMO [15\u201317]. These electronically steered phased arrays enable signals steering/beamforming with greater precision. Phased arrays for commercial deployment borrow beamforming and RF technology from arrays developed and deployed initially for military applications [18]. However, the recent advancement in semiconductor technology led to cost-effective solutions. Thus, phased arrays are now also used for commercial applications like satellites [19,20], radars [21], and 5G systems [22\u201328].\nThe main contributions of the paper are summarized as follows.\n\u2022 Provide a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art antenna array designs based on the CSA approach for future wireless systems. \u2022 Provide an in-depth insight into the existing designs and analyze the strength and weaknesses. \u2022 Provide a discussion on the potential application areas in which these designs can be used. \u2022 To highlight the significant research challenges that need to be addressed in the near future.\nWe hope that this survey will provide a foundation of knowledge on the topic and a way forward for further progress in this research area. The remaining paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly discusses the historical perspective and provides some fundamental concepts related to CSA-based phased array antenna technology and its deployment in 5G. It also assesses the challenges that are faced during the designing of high-performance UWB wide-scan phased arrays. Section 3 presents the review and categorization of proposed designs from different aspects. The paper ends with concluding remarks and future research directions."

            "text": "A multi-layer frequency spectrum approach is necessary to fulfill such a wide range of user requirements and scenarios [29,30]. The 2 to 6 GHz spectrum provides the best compromise between coverage and capacity. The 26 GHz, 28 GHz, and 37 GHz bands facilitate users with the demand for high data rates. The utilization of spectrum below 2 GHz to provide deep indoor and wide-area coverage. This multi-layer frequency spectrum approach is further deliberated in Table 1. Due to the highly fragmented electromagnetic spectrum, antenna designers face challenges in developing solutions for unique frequency bands. The solution could be to consolidate several bands into a multifunctional aperture. Ultra-wideband (UWB) arrays can be used to accomplish this challenge. CSA is one of the array designs approaches that can provide antenna arrays with operational bandwidth of a decade and more. Therefore, such arrays can result in a single aperture with wideband capability for several band operations. Additionally, these arrays can reduce the integration cost and ease other system-level requirements.\nSensors 2022, 22, 3329 3 of 25\nTraditionally phased array antennas were developed for and deployed in military applications. In the recent past, low-cost semiconductor components used in microwave and millimeter-wave systems have been readily available and are cost-efficient, thus leading to the deployment of phased array designs for commercial applications. After the advent of the radar in the 1940s, there was continuous research to improve the scan capabilities of phased arrays. The current sheet was a theoretical concept proposed by Wheeler in the 1960s, which eventually led to the realization of CSA [31]. However, the first practical implemented CSA design was reported in 2003 [32]. In the last decade, many state-of-theart UWB and wide-scan array designs based on this concept have been reported in the literature.

CSA Design Approach\nThe CSA is a fundamentally different design approach from conventional methods\nto realize wideband arrays. CSA exhibits wider bandwidth when deployed as a frequency\nselective surface (FSS) [33]. This is due to the inherent capacitance between the closely\nspaced dipole elements. Mutual coupling is used as the main design parameter in CSA.\nThe capacitive coupling between the array elements is used to counteract the destructive\nshunt inductance originating from the ground plane. In this way, the array input imped-\nance is primarily real, even for low frequencies, with even minimal height above the\nground plane. Moreover, the impedance variation due to scan angle can be curtailed using\nclosely spaced array elements. This approach works very similarly to the theoretical \u2018cur-\nrent sheet\u2019 concept proposed by Wheeler, thus named CSA.\nFigure 1. Historical perspective and present state of CSA technology."

The benefits of inter-element coupling, low dielectric profile, and overcoming the resonant behavior, eradicate the sudden impedance variations and result in an array with UWB array design. The CSA unit elements are generally sized using the highest frequency, for instance, for a square array lattice with a size nearly half of the wavelength at the\nSensors 2022, 22, 3329 4 of 25\nhighest frequency or less. The small inter-element spacing eliminates the grating lobes within the desired band and offers better potential for the wide-angle scan. CSA also provides a low-profile aperture with a thickness generally on the order of \u03bb/10 at the lowest frequency. However, the thickness at the lower frequency band is determined keeping in view the maximum tolerable impedance mismatch. These attributes make CSA a suitable choice for low-profile and conformal applications [34\u201337]. The polarization characteristics of a phased array are dependent upon the type of radiating element selected. CSA also provides orthogonal array configuration to design a dual-polarized array with superior cross-polarization isolation. To obtain dual polarization each CSA unit cell is comprised of one horizontally (H) polarized radiator and one vertically (V) polarized radiator. The phase centers for V and H polarization are not coincident. CSA is easy to operate in dual-polarization due to the simple antenna structure. Moreover, CSA brings superior performance, in terms of total electrical thickness and maximum scan angle. Some of the salient benefits of CSA-based antenna design are presented in Figure 2.\nSensors 2022, 22, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 25\nThe benefits of inter-element coupling, low dielectric profile, and overcoming the\nresonant behavior, eradicate the sudden impedance variations and result in an array with\nUWB array design.

Therefore, to avoid the grating lobed appearance, the spacing of the elements needs to be set according to the mentioned guidelines. In TCDA, superstrate loading above the aperture can significantly improve the scanning performance of the array. However, this sometimes results in the excitation of surface waves, particularly for large scan angles. Thus, solutions to avoid these surface waves are needed. Moreover, a bulky dielectric superstrate is not required as this can lead to cost and weight increases. Furthermore, this can significantly increase the thickness of the array, more lately, low-profile arrays are in high demand [44,45]."

            "heading": "3.1. UWB Array Designs",
            "text": "The progress of antenna array designs with UWB, miniaturization, high-gain, and low-scattering features have attracted growing attention. Recently, several studies on UWB phased array designs have been reported, for instance. One of the first CSA-based array designs developed and validated through hardware measurements was [46] from Harris corporation back in 2007. This approach treated the aperture of the array as a periodic surface to ensure the performance of each element within the array environment. This was contrary to traditional array design based on isolated elements and did not make up for the mutual coupling amongst the elements when placed in an array environment. This design approach of tightly coupled elements set a pathway for array designs with bandwidths nearing a decade. Frequency selective surface (FSS) was incorporated in an array based on tightly coupled elements [47] to suppress the destructive interference by the ground plane. This resulted in an increase in the bandwidth of the array by a factor of more than two. Moreover, a superstrate is used to overcome the losses due to the FSS\u2019s resistive nature. This successful integration of FSS made this array a low-profile (0.055\u03bblow). The array achieved a 21:1 bandwidth (from 0.28\u20135.92 GHz) for the practical benchmark for UWB arrays of VSWR < 3. A tightly coupled spiral array to achieve a 20:1 impedance bandwidth array aperture is reported [48]. To model, the radiation impedance of this wideband array of equivalent circuits is proposed, including the representation of superstrates and higher-order grating lobes. The inclusion of higher-order modes was critical as these modes can influence array impedance. Interwoven arms made it possible for adjacent elements to overlap. These arms overlapping played a crucial to achieve the wideband performance. A patch array based\nSensors 2022, 22, 3329 7 of 25\non tightly coupled elements with low-profile and small size is reported [49]. Interestingly FSS is used as a radiating structure, and this approach exploited the different behavior of FSS when operated in passive and radiating modes. The broadband operation is achieved using periodic excitation and coupling amongst elements. However, due to the inherent narrowband property of patch antennas, the array failed to achieve wideband operation and has an impedance bandwidth of 5.6% at 2.07 GHz. In Table 2, the reported UWB arrays are compared in terms of bandwidth, scanning range, unit element dimensions, and gain. Notably, dimensions of the unit element are mentioned in terms of \u03bbh, i.e., wavelength at the highest operating frequency for a fair comparison. Moreover, all bandwidths are calculated under the criterion of active VSWR \u2264 3. A novel technique based on characteristic modes for aperture excitation of finite element UWB arrays is reported [50]. Notably, the proposed taper provided wideband matching for all array elements, including the edge elements. This approach is unlike the traditional excitation tapers that are mainly used for beam shaping. However, this method relies on the arrays M \u00d7 N mutual impedance matrix, which needs to be measured or precomputed. Since this technique caters to the good matching of edge elements, it is suitable for array designs based on CSA because edge element performance is significantly affected by the edge effect. This excitation approach assured superior performance and aperture efficiency in a planar array. Moreover, due to its simplicity, this method can easily be incorporated into the design process to optimize unit elements and finite array geometries. The famous planar Ultrawideband phased array (PUMA) is also based on the CSA concept. Its first design was reported [41] almost a decade ago. The distinct feature of PUMA is the introduction of a novel feeding scheme that facilitated the fabrication of prototypes using standard PCB technology. Moreover, the fabrication of the shorting posts and feed lines are implemented as plated vias. Moreover, the new feed method eliminated the need for the external balun. This dual-polarized array design achieved 5:1 bandwidth, with good cross-polarization and wide-angle scan operation to 45\u25e6 in all three planes. As mentioned in the previous section, common-mode resonance is catastrophic in CSA. PUMA design used shorting posts to overcome common-mode resonance. Another PUMA dual-polarized array with 3:1 bandwidth, unbalanced feed, and fabricated using standard multi-layer PCB technology is reported in [51]. The salient feature of this array aperture that constitutes tightly coupled dipoles is it\u2019s low-profile (0.15\u03bblow). Common-mode resonance was observed because of unbalanced feed and carted using a pair of plated vias connected to the ground, which moved the problematic resonance out of the band. A low-profile UWB phased array antenna with integrated balun [52] proposed an alternative solution instead of a non-uniform characteristic mode excitation scheme [50], as just discussed above. The alternative solution made periphery elements short circuits and employed standard uniform excitation for central array elements. Notably, the proposed technique resulted in around 3 dB more gain and much higher efficiency than the commonly used resistive termination technique for medium-sized arrays. A compact 10:1 balun is integrated into the design to feed the array. This design provided a better solution than using matched loads for edge effect alleviation. Although the matched loads method improves the array bandwidth, this is done at the trade-off of realized gain and efficiency. Interestingly, non-symmetric dipole arms with strong inter-element coupling are used as an aperture to design a planar array with X-band operation using a matching network with an integrated feed [53]. The array reported 60\u25e6 and above scan performance in principal planes. The only drawback is the oversampled size of the element which is 0.34\u03bbh. Moreover, the bandwidth of this array can be much larger, but the feed design limits it. As reported for the dual-polarized array with an integrated balun having more than 7:1 bandwidth used the reactance of a Marchand balun for impedance matching [38], reproduced in Figure 4. This feeding technique led to wideband, and since no external bulky balun was used, the size was reduced significantly.

Owed to the strong mutual coupling, an omnidirectional antenna array with a wideband 1-to-12 feed network is reported for 1.7\u20133.54 GHz [58].\nSensors 2022, 22, 3329 9 of 25\nSensors 2022, 22, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 25\nbulky balun was used, the size was reduced significantly.

Moreover, a fence made from periodic inter-spaced orthogonal baluns is used to overcome propagating modes. In a similar design technique, a resistive sheet is used in another array design to successfully suppress the in-band resonances, which resulted in more than 13:1 bandwidth [56].

Another 1-D design of tightly coupled dipole array (TCDA) used a vertical parasitic superstrate layer to compensate for the variation in impedance during beam scan [62]. An advantage of this design is its lightweight due to the vertical parasitic superstrate. This linear array achieved 5:1 bandwidth with a wide-scan \u00b160\u25e6. Eight tightly coupled printed dipole units are used to fabricate a linear array for sub 6 GHz 5G bands [63]. This array antenna can be an excellent choice for future multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) beamforming base station applications. Parasitic strips are used in this design to achieve a wide scan with a low-profile (0.176\u03bb2.2 GHz). Another array design for sub-6 GHz 5G communication is based on tightly coupled patch elements with multiple feeds as reported in [64]. The antenna array design characteristics are studied using a 2-port network model.

A 9:1 dipole array employed tightly coupled topology to 60\u25e6 scan in all azimuthal planes [67]. A wideband feeding network based on folded Marchand balun was used to achieve impedance transformation. Moreover, instead of a bulky superstrate, FSS is used to achieve wide-scan performance. This approach is somewhat similar to [60] and also achieved a low profile of 0.1\u03bb2GHz. Open folded dipoles are used to achieve UWB impedance matching with a large scan range [68]. The dielectric superstrates inevitably increase the weight of the array, this design is without dielectric superstrates. Compared to the normal diploes in this design, the gap between the open folded dipoles resulted in additional capacitance. This added capacitance resulted in ultra-wideband impedance matching.

Horizontally polarized dipoles are used to design circular arrays based on the CSA design of tightly coupled elements by placing conducting reflector behind the aperture [85]. The overlapped dipoles are placed above the ground with a capacitive structure at the front, a reflector is placed behind, and a ring of the dielectric slab above to achieve 3.5:1 bandwidth. The designed array has the advantage of using it as a four-sectoral array or omnidirectional array since it acquired a consistent radiation pattern. It is enlightening to inspect radiated fields as a function of scan angle (as mentioned in Tables 2 and 3). Full-wave simulation predictions of element patterns for infinite arrays may differ from finite array measurements (especially for electrically small arrays) but still are a good indicator of polarization performance.
