Development of Portable Electrochemical Sensor Devices for Field Analysis: Design and test compact, portable versions of the electrochemical sensor system described in the study for in-field or at-the-source authentication and quality assessment of olive oils. These devices could provide immediate, onsite analysis for farmers, producers, and quality control personnel, eliminating the need for sample transport and laboratory analysis.

Expanding the Scope to Other Edible Oils and Food Products: Investigate the application of this electrochemical sensor technology for the classification and authentication of other edible oils (e.g., canola, coconut, soybean) and food products rich in antioxidants. This research could explore the sensor's versatility and adaptability to various matrices and its effectiveness in detecting fraud or assessing quality in a wider range of food products.

Enhancement of Sensor Sensitivity and Selectivity with Novel Nanomaterials: Explore the use of emerging nanomaterials (e.g., quantum dots, conductive polymers, and MOFs) to enhance the sensitivity and selectivity of electrochemical sensors for phenolic compounds and antioxidants in olive oils. This could include designing sensors that target specific phenolic compounds known for their health benefits or as markers of authenticity.

Integration with Blockchain for Traceability: Combine the electrochemical sensor technology with blockchain technology to create a transparent, tamper-proof system for tracking the origin, quality, and authenticity of olive oils throughout the supply chain. This approach could help in building consumer trust and combating olive oil fraud.

Machine Learning for Improved Data Analysis and Predictions: Apply machine learning algorithms to the multivariate data analysis process for classifying and authenticating olive oils. By training models on extensive datasets of sensor responses from authentic and adulterated samples, the system could potentially offer more accurate predictions, identify new patterns associated with geographic origin or quality, and adapt to the introduction of new oil varieties or processing methods.
