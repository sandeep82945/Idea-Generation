    "abstractText": "Purpose: Since the prompt recognition of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) and the immediate initiation of treatment can significantly reduce the risk of death, we developed a deep learning (DL)-based application aimed to automatically detect PEs on chest computed tomography angiograms (CTAs) and alert radiologists for an urgent interpretation. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were used to design the application. The associated algorithm used a hybrid 3D/2D UNet topology. The training phase was performed on datasets adequately distributed in terms of vendors, patient age, slice thickness, and kVp. The objective of this study was to validate the performance of the algorithm in detecting suspected PEs on CTAs. Methods: The validation dataset included 387 anonymized real-world chest CTAs from multiple clinical sites (228 U.S. cities). The data were acquired on 41 different scanner models from five different scanner makers. The ground truth (presence or absence of PE on CTA images) was established by three independent U.S. board-certified radiologists. Results: The algorithm correctly identified 170 of 186 exams positive for PE (sensitivity 91.4% [95% CI: 86.4\u201395.0%]) and 184 of 201 exams negative for PE (specificity 91.5% [95% CI: 86.8\u201395.0%]), leading to an accuracy of 91.5%. False negative cases were either chronic PEs or PEs at the limit of subsegmental arteries and close to partial volume effect artifacts. Most of the false positive findings were due to contrast agent-related fluid artifacts, pulmonary veins, and lymph nodes. Conclusions: The DL-based algorithm has a high degree of diagnostic accuracy with balanced sensitivity and specificity for the detection of PE on CTAs.",

            "text": "Estimated at around 180,000 deaths per year, pulmonary embolism (PE) remains a leading cause of death in the United States [1]. It is the third most common cause of cardiovascular disease events, with only myocardial infarction and stoke having a higher prevalence [2]. Prompt recognition of acute PE and immediate initiation of anticoagulation and mechanical thrombectomy can greatly reduce the risk of death [3]. The most common cause of death from PE is a failure of diagnosis [4]. The clinical presentation of PE is often nonspecific and can be mimicked by a range of other conditions. The diagnostic approach to PE usually involves a series of investigations including echocardiography and D-dimer, establishing the necessity for further confirmatory examinations like chest CT angiography (CTA) and ventilation/perfusion scans [5]. CTA has become the gold standard diagnostic modality for PE and has almost eliminated the use of ventilation/perfusion scans [6].\nDiagnostics 2023, 13, 1324. https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics13071324 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/diagnostics\nDiagnostics 2023, 13, 1324 2 of 13\nCTA is a non-invasive, widely available, and rapidly performed modality. However, the diagnosis of PE in CTA is time-consuming and requires the expertise of radiologists. As a result, the interpretation process is susceptible to errors and delayed diagnosis [7]. The usage of CTA in emerging departments has increased over 27-fold in the last two decades [8,9]. Variations in concordance between general and subspecialist radiologists have been reported as well as between residents, fellows, and attending radiologists [10]. The workload increases in emergency settings, and fatigue from long work hours and overnight shifts may contribute to an increase in diagnostic errors [11\u201313]. Studies have shown that there is up to a 13% discrepancy rate between overnight radiologists and the day faculty [14\u201316]. The radiologist\u2019s sensitivity for detecting PE has been measured in the range of 67 to 87% with a specificity of 89 to 99% [17\u201319]. Studies have reported promising results in applying deep learning (DL) models to automate PE diagnosis on CTA [20\u201325]. In a systematic review with the meta-analysis of DL-based AI algorithms developed to detect PE on CTA, published in 2021, five studies provided enough data to calculate the test accuracies [26]. A pooled sensitivity of 88% per scan and a specificity of 86% per scan were shown. Furthermore, the authors noticed a patient selection bias in more than half of the studies with a failure of the study population description. The question on the potential generalizability of such algorithms remains on hold. Actually, generalization across institutions, particularly in the setting of varying CT scanner models and reconstruction methods, present another difficulty in the generalization of automated diagnosis. The objective of our study was to validate a commercially available AI-powered application, named CINA-PE v1.0.3, for suspected PE triage and prioritization. The algorithm was trained and tested on data from multiple clinical sites and vendors. The validation of the application presented in this study was performed on CTA exams acquired on various CT scanners from multiple clinical sites through the U.S. The diagnostic performance of the device to detect PE was measured by a comparison with the ground truth established by several expert U.S. board-certified radiologists. Furthermore, an evaluation of the triage effectiveness was performed by measuring the standalone per-case processing time (timeto-notifications) of the chest CTA images. Our results demonstrated good performance of this AI-based algorithm, opening the way for its use to help radiologists by highlighting the exams that are positive for PE in the worklist, thereby accelerating the diagnosis and communication workflow."

The first stage extracted the lung and main pulmonary artery pixels from the pixel volume. Then, the region proposal network generated a first segmentation of PEs, which were then sharpened by the false positive network using a CNN region proposal network. The post-processing stage eliminated false-positives outside the lung and the main pulmonary artery, and finally, a logic function between all voxel-wise masks was used to establish the final decision. For the training phase, a K-fold cross validation schema was implemented, allowing us to pre-compute masks for each fold without introducing bias. A dataset of 150 CTAs with a balanced proportion of healthy lungs and lung diseases (pneumonia, ground-glass opacity, pleural effusion, etc.) was used to train the lung and main pulmonary artery segmentation algorithm. Then, a dataset of 4795 CTAs was used to train the region proposal network and false positive reduction networks. A masked softmax cross entropy was used as the loss function. The datasets were provided from several U.S. clinical centers and were adequately distributed in terms of vendors (Canon Medical Systems Corporation, GE Healthcare, Philips Healthcare, Siemens Healthineers), patient age, slice thickness, and kVp. The training datasets were provided by an American Teleradiology Company on behalf of\nDiagnostics 2023, 13, 1324 3 of 13\na data sharing partnership.

Consequently, if the operators noticed only the presence of occlusions of the subsegmental arteries, they were asked to label the case as being negative. In the case of discrepancy between both radiologists, a third U.S. board-certified radiologist (PC) reviewed the axial CTA series. The final ground\nDiagnostics 2023, 13, 1324 4 of 13\ntruth (presence or absence of PE) was established by majority consensus.

The 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated for sensitivity and specificity using the exact binomial distribution (Clopper\u2013 Pearson). The lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI were compared to a performance goal of 80% for sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore, the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) was calculated to measure the quality of binary classifications, which generates a high score only if the binary predictor is able to correctly predict the majority of positive and negative data instances, and returns a value between \u22121 and +1, where a coefficient of +1 represents a perfect prediction. Positive and negative predictive values were also computed using sensitivity and specificity with varying prevalence values (from 10% to 50%, increment of 5%). A stratified statistical analysis on the imaging acquisition parameters (scanner makers, number of detector rows and slice thickness) and the patient groups (age, sex, and U.S regions) was also calculated (Supplementary Materials\u2014Table S1).

            "text": "We conducted a retrospective, multicenter, and blinded study to validate the standalone performance of a new AI-powered application for suspected PE triage and prioritization on chest CTA images and to test its generalizability. The data came from multiple U.S. clinical sites acquired on five different scanner makers and 41 different scanner models. They included 186 (48.1%) positive PE cases. This validation study focused on assessing the standalone diagnostic performance of the algorithm when compared to the ground truth established by three U.S. board certified expert radiologists. The results showed an accuracy of 91.5% when compared to the visual assessment of the operators. The sensitivity and specificity exceeded 91% with a ROC-AUC of 0.92. In addition, the TTN ranging between 26 and 82 s was well-adapted for practical use in emergency radiology. According to the literature, other DL solutions achieved performances inferior or similar to those of CINA-PE, but with important limitations. Indeed, Ajmera et al. developed a 2D segmentation model consisting of U-Net architecture to detect PEs on CTAs. They tested the model performance on a single external dataset consisting of CTAs from 251 patients of whom 55 presented PE. Sensitivity and specificity were 80% and 74% respectively with an accuracy of 0.76 [25]. Huang et al. developed and evaluated an end-to-end DL model capable of detecting PE using the entire volumetric CTA imaging examination. This model achieved an AUC of 0.84 for automatic PE detection on the hold out test set and 0.85 AUC on the external datasets [20]. Liu et al. trained a DL model on the CTAs of 590 patients (460 with PE and 130 without PE) for the segmentation of the clots. Validation was performed on an in-house dataset made of 288 patients (186 with PE and 102 without PE). The AUC was 0.92, the sensitivity was 94.6%, but the specificity was only 76.5% [22]. Huhtanen et al. also developed a DL model trained and validated on 600 CTAs, and tested their model on 200 CTAs. The model achieved good performances (AUC 0.94, sensitivity 93.5% and specificity 86.6%). However, they only used data from a unique institution and the majority of the data was acquired with CT scanners from one vendor [24]. Finally, Weiker et al. trained and validated a DL solution comprising a Resnet architecture (Briefcase, Aidoc Medical) on 28,000 CTAs acquired at various institutions for automatic PE prioritization and triage. The diagnostic accuracy, measured on a test dataset including 232 positive\nDiagnostics 2023, 13, 1324 10 of 13\nand 1233 negative examinations was high with a sensitivity of 92.7% and a specificity of 95.5% [23]. However, the dataset selection for the test was made from a single institution, missing the evaluation of potential generalizability. On the other hand, in a more recent publication, investigators used the Briefcase software to retrospectively assess the presence or absence of PE on CTA examinations performed in various emergency departments and sent to interpretation centers of three French cities (Bordeaux, Lyon, and Marseille), thus reinforcing the validation of the algorithm [27]. The objective of CINA-PE is to detect acute PE on CTAs. However, even if chronic PE is not generally an urgent finding that warrants immediate triage or an immediate need to treat the patient, particular attention must be paid for \u201cchronic PEs\u201d, which may be missed by the application as in six cases of our series, especially in the presence of acquisition artifacts. The other FNs observed in our study were difficult cases with PE locations close to the partial volume effect artifacts, at the limit of subsegmental arteries, with bad quality of the image acquisitions, or in the case of complete occlusion of the artery. As the CINA-PE application was not trained to flag subsegmental arteries, the cases of subsegmental PEs detected by the algorithm and confirmed by the radiologists were considered as false positives. Indeed, as reported by Carrier et al., the subsegmental pulmonary embolism diagnoses identified by CTA are unlikely to be clinically relevant and may not be worth diagnosing, provided that there is no evidence of deep vein thrombosis [28]. The other FP cases also reported in the literature [23,24] were due to the partial volume effect with hilar lymph nodes, pulmonary veins, or streaks of beam-hardening artifacts. Consequently, any positive result detected by the algorithm leads to an automatic notification for the radiologist who has to determine the quality of images and to decide if the case is positive, negative, or indeterminate with an option of additional investigations. In clinical practice, the majority of CTAs performed for suspicion of PE are negative [29\u201331]. According to the literature, the yield of positive cases varies from less than 10 to 20\u201330% [29,31\u201333]. As prevalence has a strong influence on positive and negative predictive values, this might translate into an application site-dependent performance. When the prevalence values varied from 10% to 30% in our study data, the extrapolated positive predictive value varied from 54.6% to 82.2% while the negative predictive value moved from 99% to 96.1%. In all cases of positive results detected by the algorithm, the radiologist was informed by an automatic notification, then had to review the images flagged by the software and decide between TP and FP. For the cases not flagged by the algorithm, they were ultimately reviewed through the standard of care workflow without interruption. The main clinical usefulness of the proposed DL-based solution is currently the prioritization of CTAs detected as positive for PE for an urgent and prompt interpretation by the radiologist. This is particularly beneficial when the workload increases in emerging settings. Beyond this primary objective, such automated triage and prioritization application could potentially improve the radiologist\u2019 performance and ultimately result in better patient clinical outcomes. However, the potential benefit of using this application to improve the performance of radiologists in diagnosing PE on CTAs remains to be assessed. Hence, our next objective step will be to compare the diagnostic performances of the AI-based device alone and radiologists alone with those of radiologists with full access to the AI output during their practice. Our study presented some limitations. First of all, a direct comparison between the DL algorithm and the performance of the radiologists was not carried out. Second, we did not use a multitask DL approach like that of other investigators who developed a two-phase multitask learning method that could recognize the presence of PE and its properties as the position, whether acute or chronic, and the corresponding right-to-left ventricle ratio, thereby reducing FN diagnoses [34]. Furthermore, we did not integrate both clinical and imaging data as Huang et al. did, who developed different multimodal fusion model architectures that were capable of utilizing both pixel data from CTAs and clinical patient data from the electronic health record to automatically classify PE cases [35].\nDiagnostics 2023, 13, 1324 11 of 13\nKey Points:\n1. To help radiologists to prioritize exams with a high suspicion of pulmonary embolism (PE), a deep learning (DL) algorithm was trained on 4795 CT angiograms from multiple U.S. clinical centers and adequately distributed in terms of vendors, patient age, slice thickness, and kVp. 2. In a retrospective, multicenter, and blinded standalone validation study, the DL algorithm achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.92 [95% CI: 0.88\u20130.94] (p < 0.0001). 3. Both the training and validation of the algorithm on data from multiple clinical sites through the U.S. and acquired on multiple scanner models promotes the generalizability of its use."

The validation phase of CINA-PE achieved a high accuracy (0.92 AUC) to detect suspected acute PEs on CTAs. The great heterogeneity of datasets used for both training and validation of the DL-based software should guarantee enough robustness for generalization of its use. The potential clinical benefit of using such an automatic PE detection system to improve the performance of the radiologists, and ultimately result in better patient clinical outcomes, remains to be assessed.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/diagnostics13071324/s1.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, A.A., P.D.C. and Y.C.; Methodology, A.A., P.D.C. and Y.C.; Software, M.T. and P.D.C.; Validation, A.A. and Y.C.; Formal analysis, A.A., D.S.C., B.D.W., P.D.C. and Y.C.; Investigation, B.D.W. and P.D.C.; Resources, M.M.; Data curation, S.Q. and M.T.; Writing\u2013original draft, P.A.G.; Writing\u2013review & editing, P.A.G., A.A., S.Q., M.T., M.M., D.S.C., B.D.W., P.D.C. and Y.C.; Project administration, P.A.G., D.S.C. and P.D.C.
