To fill the gap, we developed a digital VAS and conducted a digital cross-over clinical trial by comparing appetite responses measured by this digital tool versus paper-based VAS in 102 participants in a freeliving environment. Participants consumed either a 230 or 460 kcal breakfast in randomized order in two virtual sessions, and their appetite was measured over the next 4 h using both tools. The results revealed no significant difference in hunger, fullness, satiety, or desire to eat measured by digital and paper VAS. Paper VAS resulted in a higher prospective consumption score than digital VAS; the difference (1.1 out of 100 points) was statistically significant but not practically relevant. Bland and Altman analysis also indicated consistency in the results from the two methods. In conclusion, digital VAS on a smart phone is a validated tool for appetite measurement in the real world; it provides a new way for researchers to leverage participants\u2019 mobile devices for appetite data collection in digital",

            "text": "Designing foods with greater satiating properties is a potential approach to address increased consumer need for weight management. To assess satiating properties of food or to measure human appetite, certain tools have been developed and validated in laboratory settings. Typically, appetite is measured with paper and pen using self-reported questions with responses captured by lines or Likert scales; although unipolar unstructured line (visual analog scale, VAS) is the most widely used method to measure appetite in clinical trials [1]. In this case, surveys with appetite questions, such as hunger, fullness, satiety, desire to eat, and prospective consumption, can be administered using a piece of paper with responses captured using a 100 mm horizontal line with opposite statements anchored on each end (e.g., not at all, extremely). Participants are instructed to draw a vertical marker on the horizontal line, and the distance from the left end to the position marked by the participant is measured by researchers and recorded. Over the past two decades, various portable devices have been developed and validated for appetite measurement, such as the Newton-based electronic appetite rating system (EARS) [2,3], Palm-based EARS [4], EARS II with iPAQ [5], wristwatch-based EARS [6], Dell Pocket PC EARS [7], and iPad Mini-based EARS [8]. These are specialized devices provided to participants for use in research studies, either in laboratory settings or in free-living conditions. The use of portable devices offers the flexibility of measuring appetite in any place at any time, while providing a way of checking compliance since\nNutrients 2023, 15, 304. https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15020304 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nutrients\nNutrients 2023, 15, 304 2 of 10\nthe entered appetite data are time-stamped. Nonetheless, these portable devices can be cost-prohibitive for use in clinical trials with a large number of participants. Additionally, participants need to return the devices at the end of the study for data download by researchers, which can be a burden for both parties. Digital clinical trials have gained increased attention during the COVID-19 pandemic as researchers explore methods to virtually conduct clinical trials. This involves digital technology for execution of a clinical trial with participant recruitment, data collection, and analytics [9]. With regards to appetite research, the widespread use of smart phones in recent years now offers the possibility of \u201cBring Your Own Device\u201d as another way to collect appetite data in the real world, while participants do not have to physically visit a research facility, unlike in a traditional clinical study. This may reduce the cost of research studies by eliminating the use of researcher-supplied devices and related logistics of shipping or returning of the devices. It may also improve the efficacy of data collection and data quality since researchers may monitor data in real time. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no validated digital tool for measuring appetite using VAS through a mobile app with participants using their own smart phones in remote settings. Nonetheless, development and validation of such tools are of particular importance for future research applications, considering potential benefits such as reduced research cost, reduced burden to participants and researchers, convenience for use in largescale digital clinical trials or observational studies, and improved participant engagement and data quality. The objective of our study was to develop and validate a mobile app-based VAS for appetite measurement in digital clinical trials. Validity was assessed by comparing a newly developed digital VAS with the traditional paper and pen-based VAS for appetite measurements."

Participants were also asked to complete a paper appetite survey followed by uploading a picture of the completed paper survey, as well as a digital appetite survey, both using the OTS app, as a practice prior to the study. When completing the digital appetite survey, participants were also asked to\nNutrients 2023, 15, 304 4 of 10\nuse a ruler to measure the length of the digital VAS displayed on the screen of their smart phone and report the data to the study team via the OTS app. On the day prior to the first test session, participants were reminded to avoid heavy physical activity and alcoholic drinks and to maintain their normal diet. Later that day, participants were reminded not to consume any food or beverage, except water, after 10:00 p.m. On the next day, participants were instructed to prepare the test food for breakfast at 7:50 a.m., which included 1 or 2 servings of the biscuits with 8 ounces of water using a measuring cup, take a picture of the breakfast, and upload it using the OTS app. At 8:00 a.m., participants were instructed to complete both a digital and paper appetite survey, in random order, and start eating breakfast. They were asked to finish the entire breakfast in 15 min. Immediately after breakfast, participants were asked to complete another set of digital and paper appetite surveys. Subsequently, participants were asked to not eat or drink anything in the next four hours and avoid moderate or heavy physical activity, while not reading books, watching TV, or browsing the internet for any content related to food. Another set of digital and paper appetite surveys was completed 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 min after breakfast. Each time, the order of the digital versus paper appetite survey was randomized by asking participants to randomly choose from the two options in the app. After completing a paper survey, participants were asked to upload a picture of the completed survey using the OTS app and then immediately place the completed survey in the designated return envelope. The procedure for the second test session was similar to that of the first test session, except that a different serving of biscuit was consumed and a final survey about the participants\u2019 experience was administered. The survey collected information on preference for paper versus digital VAS and ease of use for each method using a 5-point scale. After the final survey, participants were debriefed and informed that the primary goal of the study was to compare the digital vs. paper VAS for appetite measurements. Participants were asked to return the completed paper appetite surveys to the study team by mail."

The significant differ nce may be due to the increased power resulting from the larg sample size in the study and the capacity to render very small differences significant. As envisioned, the difference in the least squares means was only 1.1 out of 100 points. A difference at this magnitude is likely to be non-relevant for practical purposes. Moreover, results from the Bland and Altman analysis, as well as results from the sensitivity analysis, further confirmed that both methods provided similar results. Theoretically, participants may give the same response when they are asked the same question using different tools by recalling their previous response. However, the VAS data\nNutrients 2023, 15, 304 8 of 10\nwas captured on a continuous scale with responses transcribed to a numeric value between 0 and 100 by the researchers, and participants did not directly see the numeric value from the survey they completed. Thus, recalling the exact position they marked on a VAS could be difficult in most cases unless they intentionally measured it. Additionally, to reduce the possibility of participants directly copying the answer from one tool to another tool, the app was programmed such that when the digital VAS was submitted, the data entry could not be retrieved by the participant. Similarly, when the paper VAS was completed, participants were asked to place it into a designated return envelope before completing the digital VAS. Some recent studies have used mobile phones to collect appetite data using a categorical scale. For example, the PREDICT 1 study used the Zoe study app to collect hunger data using a scale from 0 to 10 in free living conditions [16]. Recently, a digital app called APPetite measuring appetite using a 11-point Likert scale was validated [12]. While both the 11-point Likert scale and VAS have been used to measure appetite in laboratory studies, VAS is more commonly used [1]. Additionally, the use of 100 points in VAS may provide a higher level of sensitivity given that the responses can vary over a broader range than in an 11-point Likert scale, extrapolating conclusions from a study that compared line and categorical scales for measurement of flavor intensity and taste [17]. We could not find any previous study that directly compared VAS with categorical scales for appetite measurement; this could be an interesting question for study in the future. As such, VAS is likely to be more versatile than a Likert scale and certainly more consistent with appetite measurements in research over the last several decades. The new digital tool now offers another and potentially superior platform for appetite measurement in future nutrition studies. One potential technical challenge in developing a digital VAS with participants\u2019 own devices is that the length of the digital scale displayed on the screen may vary depending on the screen size of a smart phone or the orientation of the device (whether the phone is held in portrait or landscape position). This may not be an issue for responses captured by a 11-point Likert scale since these are essentially multiple choice questions displayed on the screen. To address the orientation issue, the app was programmed in such a way that the appetite survey could only be displayed and completed when the phone was detected to be held in landscape mode. We chose landscape mode rather than portrait mode because the physical length of a digital horizontal line in that situation would be closer to 100 mm, which is the standard length on paper VAS. Data from our study indicated that 74 participants used the iPhone (models varied from iPhone 8 to iPhone 13 Pro Max) and 28 used Android devices (manufacturers included LG, Samsung, Google, and OnePlus). The length of digital VAS displayed on smart phone screens in this study varied between 85 and 128 mm with a median of 105 mm, and 80% of the length data were between 90 and 110 mm. Visual examination of the appetite data did not reveal any specific data pattern related to the physical length of the scale, indicating that length may not be a critical factor. Indeed, Chaput et al. [18] compared 100 and 150 mm lines for paper VAS and concluded the scales were interchangeable for appetite measurement in response to meals in free living conditions based on the results showing no difference between the two tools. Compared to clinical trials conducted in traditional research facilities, digital studies conducted virtually may have greater external generalizability since participants can be followed up in the real world. However, this brings the potential issue of compliance. As appetite feelings are time dependent, responding to appetite surveys in a timely manner is crucial to ensure the quality of research data. In our primary analysis, we excluded a few subjects who completed multiple appetite surveys around the same time later in the day. We also conducted a sensitivity analysis by excluding subjects who responded to survey tasks at least 10 min late on average. The reason for not excluding these participants in the primary analysis was because missing data can be imputed using the last observation carried forward method in clinical research. When dealing with missing data, appetite data being late by 10 min could be a better option than replacing the missing data with an\nNutrients 2023, 15, 304 9 of 10\nearlier appetite response, which was usually 30 min earlier in this study. Eleven percent of participants were excluded based on this criterion in the sensitivity analysis. Our compliance was comparable to a previous study reporting that 82% of responses were received within 15 min after a text was sent to participants to report their appetite in a free-living condition [19]. Our study has several clear strengths. It provides a newly validated digital technology that may be used in future studies with the use of mobile devices from participants in a cost and time efficient manner, thus eliminating the requirement of device shipping and return using existing EARS. Our study also included a large sample size with participants recruited remotely in the US, demonstrating that this new tool can be used in large-scale virtual trials without geographic restrictions for participation. Moreover, the digital VAS was validated for use in various smart phone models available on the market today. Nonetheless, our study has certain limitations. First, test-retest reproducibility was not assessed. The reproducibility of paper VAS and EARS have been shown previously [11,20]. In our study, we chose to test the method in two conditions with different caloric preloads; our results revealed similar appetite data from the digital and paper tools in each condition. Second, the study consisted of healthy adult participants with normal or overweight status. Future studies may be needed for assessment of obese subjects, children, or participants with eating disorders. Lastly, the study app was installed on smart phones; it is unknown whether the same conclusion would be reached if the app were used on tablets or computers with much larger screen sizes. In conclusion, the mobile app-based digital VAS is a validated and preferred tool for measuring appetite in the real world, compared to the traditional paper-based VAS.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, Y.Z., J.E.B., N.M.H. and R.S.M.; methodology, Y.Z., J.E.B., N.M.H. and R.S.M.; software, R.M.; validation, Y.Z., J.E.B., N.M.H. and R.S.M.; formal analysis, N.M.H.; investigation, Y.Z., J.E.B., N.M.H., R.M. and R.S.M.; resources, Y.Z.; data curation, R.M. and N.M.H.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, Y.Z.; writing\u2014review and editing, Y.Z., J.E.B., N.M.H., R.M. and R.S.M.; visualization, Y.Z., N.M.H. and R.S.M.; supervision, Y.Z. and R.S.M.; project administration, Y.Z.; funding acquisition, Y.Z.
