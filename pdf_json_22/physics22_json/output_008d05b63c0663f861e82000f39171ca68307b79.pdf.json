    "abstractText": "The bound state in the continuum (BIC) is a nonradiative eigenstate of an open system the eigenvalue of which lies in the continuum of propagating waves [1\u20134]. The BICs were first found when solving the problem of the eigenenergy of a particle in a spherical quantum well [5]. Von Neumann and Wigner found special oscillating potentials tending asymptotically to zero far from the quantum well, the destructive interference on which allows a particle to stay localized even at the energies above the potential well. The BIC is a general wave phenomenon, which is always caused by the destructive interference of waves leaking from a system. For convenience, the BICs are classified, according to types of their formation, into symmetry-protected, Friedrich\u2013Wintgen, Fabry\u2013Perot, and accidental [6]. Theoretically, the BICs have an infinite Q-factor, since they do not radiate into the environment. To excite and detect the resonance, the BIC should be coupled with the propagating waves. Then, the BIC turns into a quasi-BIC with a finite Q-factor. Varying the parameters of a system near the BIC, one can control the coupling between the resonance and the continuum, i.e., the resonant Qfactor. The quasi-BICs with controllable Q-factor have been proposed for various photonics applications, e.g., lasers [7\u20139], light filters [10\u201312], sensors [13\u201315], waveguides [16\u201319], and amplification of nonlinear effects [20\u2013 22]. The BICs can be implemented in three-, two-, and onedimensional structures extended at least in one spatial dimension [1]. The BICs in a one-dimensional photonic structure were first implemented in [23], where the authors created a trilayer waveguide made of anisotropic Materials, which supported a BIC with a theoretically infinite path length. In one-dimensional structures based on photonic crystals (PhCs) with anisotropic layers, BICs were studied theoretically [24\u201327] and experimentally [28, 29]. In this work, we consider a one-dimensional anisotropic PhC consisting of alternating isotropic and anisotropic layers. Introducing one anisotropic defect layer in this PhC, one can engineer symmetry-protected BICs [24, 25] as well as Friedrich\u2013Wintgen BICs [26]. Here, we study the case of two anisotropic defect layers, which allow us to set up a Fabry\u2013Perot BIC. Since each separate defect can exhibit a BIC-induced resonance, they are equivalent to two perfectly reflecting mirrors arranged in such a way that the waves are reflected in antiphase and compensate each other making it possible to obtain a Fabry\u2013Perot BIC [30\u201334].",

Timofeev Kirensky Institute of Physics, Krasnoyarsk Scientific Center,\nSiberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences, Krasnoyarsk, 660036 Russia Siberian Federal University, Krasnoyarsk, 660041 Russia and\n\u2217pavel-s-pankin@iph.krasn.ru\n(Dated: November 1, 2022)\nAn anisotropic photonic crystal containing two anisotropic defect layers is considered. It is demonstrated that the system under can support a Fabry\u2013Perot bound state in the continuum (FP-BIC). A fully analytic solution of the scattering problem as well as a condition for FP-BIC have been derived in the framework of the temporal coupled-mode theory.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe bound state in the continuum (BIC) is a nonradiative eigenstate of an open system the eigenvalue of which lies in the continuum of propagating waves [1\u20134]. The BICs were first found when solving the problem of the eigenenergy of a particle in a spherical quantum well [5]. Von Neumann and Wigner found special oscillating potentials tending asymptotically to zero far from the quantum well, the destructive interference on which allows a particle to stay localized even at the energies above the potential well. The BIC is a general wave phenomenon, which is always caused by the destructive interference of waves leaking from a system. For convenience, the BICs are classified, according to types of their formation, into symmetry-protected, Friedrich\u2013Wintgen, Fabry\u2013Perot, and accidental [6].\nTheoretically, the BICs have an infinite Q-factor, since they do not radiate into the environment. To excite and detect the resonance, the BIC should be coupled with the propagating waves. Then, the BIC turns into a quasi-BIC with a finite Q-factor. Varying the parameters of a system near the BIC, one can control the coupling between the resonance and the continuum, i.e., the resonant Qfactor. The quasi-BICs with controllable Q-factor have been proposed for various photonics applications, e.g., lasers [7\u20139], light filters [10\u201312], sensors [13\u201315], waveguides [16\u201319], and amplification of nonlinear effects [20\u2013 22].\nThe BICs can be implemented in three-, two-, and onedimensional structures extended at least in one spatial dimension [1]. The BICs in a one-dimensional photonic structure were first implemented in [23], where the authors created a trilayer waveguide made of anisotropic Materials, which supported a BIC with a theoretically infinite path length. In one-dimensional structures based on photonic crystals (PhCs) with anisotropic layers, BICs were studied theoretically [24\u201327] and experimentally [28, 29].\nIn this work, we consider a one-dimensional anisotropic PhC consisting of alternating isotropic and anisotropic layers. Introducing one anisotropic defect layer in this\nPhC, one can engineer symmetry-protected BICs [24, 25] as well as Friedrich\u2013Wintgen BICs [26]. Here, we study the case of two anisotropic defect layers, which allow us to set up a Fabry\u2013Perot BIC. Since each separate defect can exhibit a BIC-induced resonance, they are equivalent to two perfectly reflecting mirrors arranged in such a way that the waves are reflected in antiphase and compensate each other making it possible to obtain a Fabry\u2013Perot BIC [30\u201334]."

The refractive index of the isotropic layer is no = \u221a \u03b5o and the layer thickness is do. The anisotropic layer with thickness de has the ordinary refractive index no = \u221a \u03b5o and the extraordinary refractive index ne = \u221a \u03b5e for the waves polarized along the y-axis (y-wave) and x-axis (x-wave) direction, respectively. The layer thicknesses are quarter-wave and are determined by the equation\nkodo = kede = k0\u03bbPBG\n4 =\n\u03c0\u03c9\n2\u03c9PBG , (1)\nwhere ko,e = k0no,e, k0 = \u03c9/c is the wavenumber in vacuum, \u03c9 is the light frequency, c is the speed of light, \u03c9PBG is the photonic band gap (PBG) center frequency, and \u03bbPBG is the corresponding wavelength.\nHalf-wave defect layers, ADL 1 and ADL 2, with the thickness dADL = 2de are made of the same materials as the anisotropic layer and characterized by the permittivity tensor. The dielectric tensor is determined by the direction of unit vectors\ne1,2 = (cos (\u03c61,2), sin (\u03c61,2), 0) \u2020. (2)\nwith reaspect to the coordinate axes. With given directions of vectors e1,2, the permittivity tensor takes the form\nar X\niv :2\n21 0.\n17 10\n3v 1\n[ ph\nys ic\ns. op\ntic s]\n3 1\nO ct\n2 02\n2\n2\n\u03021,2 =\n{ \u03b5e cos 2(\u03c61,2) + \u03b5o sin 2(\u03c61,2) sin (2\u03c61,2) (\u03b5e \u2212 \u03b5o)/2\nsin (2\u03c61,2) (\u03b5e \u2212 \u03b5o)/2 \u03b5e sin2(\u03c61,2) + \u03b5o cos2(\u03c61,2)\n} . (3)\nThe defect layers, ADL 1 and ADL 2, are separated by the PhC containing 2N+1 layers, where N is the number of full periods between defects.\nAll the PhC layers for the y-waves have the refractive index no, while the refractive index for the x-waves alternates along the z-axis. Therefore, a PBG arises for the x-waves only, while the y-waves form a continuum of propagating waves. The anisotropic PhC is transparent to y-waves and nontransparent for x-waves at the normal incidence. The above is illustrated by the spectra in Fig. 1 (b) calculated by the Berreman transfer matrix method [35] with finite number m of periods to the left and to the right of the ADLs. At the angles of rotation\nof the ADL optical axes \u03c61,2 = 0, both polarizations are fully decoupled [24]. Rotating the optical axes of the defect layers, one can mix the two polarizations and localize the x-wave. The localization manifests itself in the form of resonant features in the y-polarized spectrum in\nFig. 1 (b). One of the resonant features is extremely narrow, which is indicative of a high Q-resonance (Q \u2248 106) to be confirmed by a large amplitude of the localized wave shown in Fig. 1 (c). It can be seen that the x-component is localized within the ADLs similar to an ordinary defect mode. At the same time the y-component is localized between ADLs, which is distinctive for the FP-BIC [1].\n3"

            "text": "The collapses of the resonant lines result from the coupling between the resonant modes localized in both ADLs, which is evidenced by the avoided crossing. In Figs. 3 (a-c), the red dashed line shows the resonant frequency \u03c91 as a function of the rotation angle for the structure containing only ADL 1. The red solid line\nshows the resonant frequency \u03c92 for the structure containing only ADL 2, the rotation angle of which is fixed. Both lines are obtained using Eqs. (36). It can be seen that, in the system with two ADLs, the resonant lines pass below and above the resonance frequencies \u03c91,2. The coupling between the resonant modes is due to the\noff-diagonal elements of the matrix A\u0302, Eq. (32), see [39] for more detail. The tunneling coupling constant v (25) tends to zero with the increase of the number of periods between the ADLs\nlim N\u2192\u221e v = 0, (38)\nsince the field distributions E1,2 are evanescent functions decaying exponentially outside the ADL [40], i.e. I1,2 = 0 in Eqs. (21-22), see Fig. 1 in Suplementary Materials. This explains the repulsion of the resonant lines with decreasing N .\nIt can be seen in Fig. 4 that at large N the spectra replicate, see Fig. 4 (a, e, f), with a period of \u2206N = 4. This can be explained by the fact that in Eq (31) we\n6\ncan ignore the terms that include v at large N . The resulting equation does not change with an increase in L by an integer number ` of half-waves\n\u03c1(kL) = \u03c1(kL+ `\u03c0). (39)\nAccording to Eq. (37) it can be shown that with our calculation parameters kodo = \u03c0/2 and kode = \u03c0/4 for \u03c9 = \u03c9PBG, the smallest integer is ` = 3 at \u2206N = 4. The spectra obtained with the TCMT, Fig. 2, and Fig. 3 (d-e) are consistent with the spectra obtained by the Berreman method, Fig. 2, and Fig. 3 (a-c), also see Fig. 2 in Suplementary Materials. The difference between the two methods is observed when the approximations used to build the TCMT, \u03c61,2 1 and v 1, break down, see\nFig. 3 in Suplementary Materials. The parameters at which the resonant line collapses can be found by solving the eigenvalue problem, which is\nformulated as\nA\u0302|a\u3009 = 0. (40)\nThe BIC can be found as a solution of Eq. (40) with a real eigenfrequency \u03c9 = \u03c9BIC. However, there is a more convenient way to obtain the FP-BIC condition for N 1. The two ADLs can act as a pair of perfect mirrors that trap waves between them. The FP-BICs are formed when the resonance frequency or the spacing, L, between the two ADLs is tuned to make the round-trip phase shifts add up to an integer multiple of 2\u03c0 [1]. Then, the equation for the FP-BICs have the following form:\n\u03c8res + koL = \u03c0`, (41)\nwhere \u03c8res = arg(S11) found from Eq. (8) is the phase of the resonant reflection from the ADL, and ` is an integer\n7\nnumber. From the Eq. (35) \u03c8res has the following form:\n\u03c8res = 2\u03c8d = \u03c8 + \u03c0/2 = kodADL, (42)\nwhere \u03c8d = arg(d) is the phase of the coupling constant Eq. (10). Taking into account that ko = \u03c9BICno/c and the expression for L (37) we can obtain the equation for the FP-BICs frequencies\n\u03c9BIC = \u03c0`c\nno(dADL +N(do + de) + do) . (43)\nThe required value ` is defined using the equation (36) as follows\n\u03c9BIC = \u03c91,2(\u03c61,2). (44)\nThe solution of Eq. (43), and Eq. (44) is shown im Fig. 3, and Fig. 4 by red crosses. It can be seen that for N = 12,\nFig. 3 (f), the FP-BIC frequency found from the above equations matches the numerical data to a good accuracy,\nwhile for N = 24, 28, 30 it corresponds the exact position of the resonant line collapse. The deviation at N = 12 is because Eq. (41) neglects the tunneling coupling constant v, Eq. (38)."

The proposed model can be used to design microcavities with controllable Q-factor [28, 29]."
