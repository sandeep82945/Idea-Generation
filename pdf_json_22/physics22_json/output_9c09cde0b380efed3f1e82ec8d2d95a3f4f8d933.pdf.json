            "text": "The conditions for matter asymmetry generation, formulated by Sakharov, require the matter in the early universe to be out of thermal equilibrium [1]. For a specific field-theoretical model, the CPT and unitarity constraints provide a perturbative mechanism to check that no asymmetry is generated in equilibrium [2, 3]. Theoretical development and related diagrammatic formalism were focused mainly on using the classical kinetic theory and Boltzmann equation [4\u20138]. Quantum statistics has been considered for the leading-order asymmetries only [3, 9\u201311]. Using an unconventional diagrammatic approach introduced in Ref. [11, 12], we formulate CPT and unitarity constraints for higher-order asymmetries, including thermalmass effects in the leading-order asymmetry kinematics. In the rest of this section, we introduce two ingredients that we find particularly useful for early universe calculations. First, we explain the role of perturbative unitarity in reaching completeness in the quantum description of particles\u2019 interactions. Next, the use of cylindrical diagrams introduced in our previous work in Ref. [11], to account for quantumness in the kinetic theory of a many-body system, is briefly reviewed. In Sect. 2, the seesaw type-I leptogenesis model and top-Yukawa corrections to the leading-order asymmetries are considered. This study is not primarily focused on lepton number asymmetry generation and the model is only a working example. The anomalous thresholds in the relevant forwardscattering diagrams are shown to be related to the Higgs thermal mass. Finally, in Sect. 3, we demonstrate that taking all possible holomorphic cuts into account, including windings of propagators, while using zero-temperature rates, results in quantum thermal effects showing up in the unitarity relations."

            "text": "Before we dive into the kinetic description of the matter in the early universe, let us comment on the perturbative treatment of interactions by means of zero-temperature quantum field\n\u2013 1 \u2013\ntheory. Scattering matrix elements for any i \u2192 f reaction can be split as Sfi = \u03b4fi + iTfi. The transition probability per unit volume per unit time then equals\n1\nV4 |Tfi|2 = (2\u03c0)4\u03b4(4)(pf \u2212 pi)|Mfi|2. (1.1)\nThe amplitude squared can also be expressed as a product of two diagrams\n\u2212iM \u2020if iMfi (1.2)\nthat, in turn, can be interpreted as a Cutkosky cut of a forward-scattering diagram. It is important to note that to achieve the asymmetry cancelation when summing over the final states, and also to obtain infrared-finite results through the Kinoshita-Lee-Nauenberg theorem [13\u201315], for each initial state, one needs to consider a complete set of the final states at a given perturbative order. These final states follow from the diagrammatic structure of the theory. Starting with forward-scattering diagrams for an initial state i, one performs all their kinematically-allowed cuts. However, the standard Cutkosky cuts include complex conjugated diagrams, as seen in Eq. (1.2). It turns out to be very convenient to employ the so-called holomorphic cutting rules instead [16\u201319]. Using the S-matrix unitarity while expanding S\u2020 = S\u22121 into a geometric series, we obtain\n|Tfi| 2 = \u2212iTif iTfi + \u2211 n iTiniTnf iTfi \u2212 . . . (1.3)\nTherefore, instead of the single Cutkosky cut with complex conjugation, we may cut the diagrams multiple times with appropriate signs according to Eq. (1.3), simply putting the intermediate states on their mass shell. We emphasize that considering all kinematicallyallowed cuts, one often has to deal with anomalous thresholds [18, 20\u201322]. At low perturbative orders, these typically appear in the presence of unstable particles, such as right-handed neutrinos of the seesaw type-I leptogenesis. In the square of the amplitude, they emerge as interference between connected and disconnected diagrams. Theories with irreducible complex phases in couplings allow for CP violating interactions. Employing the unitarity expansion of Eq. (1.3), we obtain for the i \u2192 f reaction asymmetry [19]\n\u2206|Tfi|2 = |Tfi|2 \u2212 |Tif |2 = \u2211 n (iTiniTnf iTfi \u2212 iTif iTfniTni) (1.4)\n\u2212 \u2211 n,m (iTiniTnmiTmf iTfi \u2212 iTif iTfmiTmniTni)\n+ . . .\nwhere CPT symmetry has been assumed. Note that a non-vanishing asymmetry is obtained for forward-scattering diagrams with at least two simultaneous kinematically-allowed cuts. Usually, this condition is phrased in terms of the imaginary part of loop integrals. Furthermore, the two terms in each bracket only differ when complex couplings are present. Even at this level, we may appreciate the immediate insight from Eq. (1.4) generalizing the approach of Ref. [4] to higher-order asymmetries. When summing over the final states f , the terms in the brackets cancel pairwise and the sum of the asymmetries vanishes explicitly. Therefore, the CPT and unitarity constraints \u2013 the main objective of this work \u2013 are manifested in a simple diagrammatic way.\n\u2013 2 \u2013"

The circle refers to the use of zero-temperature quantum field theory, describing the interactions as if appearing in vacuum. In thermal equilibrium, the circled particle phase-space density f\u030ai corresponds to the Maxwell-Boltzmann exponential. How can we properly account for quantum effects in the above rates, going beyond the classical description represented by the Boltzmann equation? Naively, one may put the quantum statistical factors for the final states by hand. However, in higher-order calculations, a modification of the on-shell part of the propagators occurs. For a consistent treatment of such effects, and also to avoid double-counting of the on-shell intermediate states, we have to consider the evolution of the density matrix. This is usually achieved in a top-down approach [23\u201326], starting with the Keldysh-Schwinger formalism [27, 28] reduced to the Kadanoff-Baym kinetic equations [29]. Our approach is different. In generality we may write the density matrix as [30]\n\u03c1\u0302 = 1\nZ exp\n{ \u2212 F\u0302 } , where Z = Tr exp { \u2212 F\u0302 } (1.7)\nfor a Hermitian operator F\u0302 . Neglecting multiparticle correlations, we may also write F\u0302 = \u2211 p Fpa \u2020 pap (1.8)\nwhere p labels a single-particle state, while a\u2020p and ap denote creation and annihilation operators, respectively. Then for the mean occupation number, we obtain\nf(p) = Tr { \u03c1\u0302a\u2020pap } =\n1 exp { Fp } \u2213 1\n(1.9)\nwhere the upper (lower) sign corresponds to the bosonic (fermionic) particle species. In analogy to the equilibrium case, we define a circled density [11]\nf\u030a(p) = exp { \u2212 Fp } = f(p)\n1\u00b1 f(p) . (1.10)\nWe further assume the mean free path of particles is much bigger than the range of their interactions. Then we may use the asymptotic states necessary to describe the system\u2019s temporal evolution in terms of the S-matrix elements [31]\n\u03c1\u0302 \u2192 S\u0302\u03c1\u0302S\u0302\u2020. (1.11)\n\u2013 3 \u2013\nThis includes changes in higher occupation numbers represented by quantum or uncircled rates. While using the same S-matrix elements as in Eq. (1.5), the uncircled \u03b3fi is obtained from cuttings of diagrams with propagators wound up on a cylindrical surface (see Ref. [11] for more details). For each line entering the initial state, one power of the respective circled density is added. Summing over all possible winding numbers, quantum densities are obtained from the circled ones in the geometric series\nf(p) = \u221e\u2211 w=1 (\u00b11)w\u22121f\u030a(p)w. (1.12)\nSimilarly, for each intermediate-state cut in Eq. (1.5), a quantum statistical factor 1\u00b1 f(p) is obtained from the summation over the winding numbers. In the rest of this work, we stick to the equilibrium phase-space densities, as they are relevant to the asymmetry cancelations. The detailed balance principle then implies\u220f\n\u2200i f\u030ai(pi) = \u220f \u2200f f\u030af (pf ) (1.13)\nand, using Eqs. (1.4) and (1.5) \u2211 f \u2206\u03b3\u030afi = 0. (1.14)\nOur main goal is to generalize this relation, following from unitarity and CPT symmetry, for the uncircled or quantum-corrected rates at higher perturbative orders."

            "text": "In this section, we consider the seesaw type-I leptogenesis to study the connection between higher-order asymmetries and Higgs thermal-mass effects in the leading-order asymmetry kinematics.

In addition to that, the Lagrangian density\nL \u2283 \u22121 2 MiN\u0304iNi \u2212 (Y\u03b1iN\u0304iPLl\u03b1H + Ytt\u0304PLQH + H.c.). (2.1)\ncontains the interactions of right-handed neutrinos Ni and their Majorana masses. The couplings Y\u03b1i may come with irreducible complex phases responsible for the lepton number asymmetry generation [32\u201334]. The role of the top-Yukawa interactions in leptogenesis has been studied in the literature within the classical kinetic theory [35\u201342], thermal field theory [43\u201345], and non-relativistic effective theory [46\u201348]. To our best knowledge, CPT and unitarity constraints for higher-order asymmetries have only been formulated for the classical case1. For the purpose of this work, the relevant contributions of the O(Y 4Y 2t ) order are generated by the NiQ, NiQ\u0304, Nit, and Nit\u0304 initial states. We only consider the lepton number violating forward-scattering diagrams listed in Fig. 1 for the NiQ initial state. These have to be cut several times, respecting the kinematics, following Eq. (1.4).\n1Within the closed-time-path formalism the leading-order asymmetry cancelations have been considered in Ref. [49].\n\u2013 4 \u2013\nLet us examine a specific way of cutting the diagram in Fig. 1a, contributing to the NiQ\u2192 lHQ reaction rate asymmetry [19]\n\u2206\u03b3\u030a (1a) NiQ\u2192lHQ =\nl\u03b1\nH\nNj l\u0304\u03b2\nH\u0304\nt\nH\nNi\nQ\nNi\nQ\n+\nl\u03b1\nH\nNj l\u0304\u03b2\nH\u0304\nt\nH\nNi\nQ\nNi\nQ\n(2.2)\n\u2212\nl\u03b1\nH\nNj l\u0304\u03b2\nH\u0304\nt\nH\nNi\nQ\nNi\nQ\n\u2212 m.t.\nwhere the last diagram with three holomorphic cuts comes with a minus sign as indicated in Eq. (1.4). The l\u0304H\u0304 loop must be cut to violate CP or, alternatively, to produce the imaginary part of the loop integral. The other diagrams in Figs. 1b-1d can be cut similarly, contributing to the asymmetry of the same process. In Eq. (2.2), the m.t. stands for the abbreviation of the so-called mirrored terms. Here they originate in cutting the diagram\nNjl\u0304\u03b2\nH\u0304\nl\u03b1\nH\nt\nH\nNi\nQ\nNi\nQ\n(2.3)\n\u2013 5 \u2013\nobtained from Fig. 1a viewed in a mirror with all arrows reversed. No quantum statistics is considered at this place. Thus, no statistical factors are included in the intermediate states, and we only work with circled (i.e. zero-temperature) reaction rates. Considering the cuts of the box subdiagram appearing in Eq. (2.2), which can be attributed to the anomalous thresholds in the NiQ scattering [18], two remarkable observations can be made. First, putting one of the Higgses on its mass shell immediately puts the second one on the mass shell too, seemingly obtaining an ill-defined expression with delta function squared. Similar issues have been resolved in Refs. [15, 42], while the present NiQ\u2192 lHQ asymmetry has been studied in our previous work in Ref. [19]. To overcome this difficulty, we deal with the on-shell intermediate states using the distributional identity\n1\nk2 + i = P.V.\n1\nk2 \u2212 i\u03c0\u03b4(k2) or H\nNi l\u03b1\nQ t\n= P.V. H\nNi l\u03b1\nQ t\n+ 1\n2 H\nNi l\u03b1\nQ t\n(2.4)\nwhere only the positive-frequency part of the delta function has been included in the second equality. Applying Eq. (2.4) to the Higgs propagators cancels the last term with three simultaneous cuts in Eq. (2.2). The two remaining terms are equal, and we obtain [19]\n\u2206\u03b3\u030a (1a) NiQ\u2192lHQ = 2P.V.\nl\u03b1\nH\nNj l\u0304\u03b2\nH\u0304\nt\nH\nNi\nQ\nNi\nQ\n\u2212 m.t. (2.5)\nwhere the principal value refers to the uncut Higgs line. Now, we can employ [15, 42]\n2\u03b4+(k 2)P.V.\n1 k2 = \u2212 1 (k0 + |k|)2 \u2202\u03b4(k0 \u2212 |k|) \u2202k0 (2.6)\nwith \u03b4+(k 2) = \u03b8(k0)\u03b4(k2), and, up to a regularized infrared divergence, a well-defined result is obtained. Second, the cuts in Eq. (2.2) leave the Q momentum unchanged. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect the contribution to be a correction to the leading-order Ni \u2192 lH decay asymmetry. Indeed, similar relations, or the so-called mass-derivative relations, have been derived for the CP symmetric part of the rate, reading [12]\n\u03b3\u030aNiQ\u2192lHQ + \u03b3\u030aNiQ\u0304\u2192lHQ\u0304 + \u03b3\u030aNit\u2192lHt + \u03b3\u030aNi t\u0304\u2192lHt\u0304 = m\u030a 2 H,Yt(T )\n\u2202\n\u2202m2H \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 m2H=0 \u03b3\u030aNi\u2192lH . (2.7)\nOn the left-hand side, the rates have been obtained by cutting the box diagrams similar to those in Fig. 1, with no additional asymmetry-generating loops. The right-hand side contains the top Yukawa contribution to Higgs thermal mass\nm\u030a2H,Yt(T ) = 12Y 2 t \u222b [dpQ]f\u030aQ (2.8)\n\u2013 6 \u2013\nand its effect in the Ni decay kinematics. However, the usual definition of the thermal mass includes the uncircled Fermi-Dirac quark density, which is not the case here, and we will come to that later. In Eq. (2.7), we omitted the thermal part of the wave-function renormalization of the cut Higgs lines, as it vanishes when dimensional regularization is used [44]. A more general case can be found in Appendix B. One may naturally raise a question \u2013 can a relation similar to that in Eq. (2.7) be formulated for the Ni \u2192 lH decay asymmetry on the right-hand side? Remarkably, the answer is positive. Let us consider the cuts of the diagrams in Fig. 1 as seen in Eq. (2.2). Summing them up, we obtain the contribution to the circled NiQ\u2192 lHQ asymmetry\n\u2206\u03b3\u030a (1a) NiQ\u2192lHQ + \u2206\u03b3\u030a (1b) NiQ\u2192lHQ + \u2206\u03b3\u030a (1c) NiQ\u2192lHQ + \u2206\u03b3\u030a (1d) NiQ\u2192lHQ = (2.9)\n12Y 2t \u222b [dpNi ][dpQ]f\u030aNi f\u030aQ \u2211 j 6=i Im(Y \u2020Y )2ij 16\u03c02 Mj Mi [ M2i M2i \u2212M2j \u2212 1 2 ln M2i +M 2 j M2j ] .\nTo include other initial states with Q replaced by Q\u0304, t, and t\u0304, we only need to multiply this result by the factor of four. Unlike the contributions of particular diagrams, listed in Appendix A, the expression in Eq. (2.9) does not depend on the energy squared s = (pNi +pQ)\n2 of the reaction. In fact, the integration over the quark momenta and phase-space density can be factored out, suggesting a possible connection to the Higgs thermal mass due to its interaction with quarks in the thermal medium. Next we consider the Ni \u2192 lH asymmetry evaluated at a finite value of the Higgs mass. We compute its derivative and take the massless limit, obtaining\n\u2202\n\u2202m2H \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 mH=0 \u2206\u03b3\u030aNi\u2192lH = \u222b [dpNi ]f\u030aNi \u2211 j 6=i Im(Y \u2020Y )2ij 4\u03c02\n(2.10)\n\u00d7 Mj Mi\n[ M2i\nM2i \u2212M2j \u2212 1 2 ln M2i +M 2 j M2j\n] .\nThe result is four times the result in Eq. (2.9) and we see that the sum of the NiQ\u2192 lHQ, NiQ \u2192 lHQ\u0304, Nit \u2192 lHt, and Nit \u2192 lHt\u0304 asymmetries receives the contribution from the Higgs thermal mass, similarly to Eq. (2.7) for the symmetric part. However, we need to emphasize that the mass-derivative only stands for a part of these asymmetries. There are additional cuttings, namely\n\u2206\u03b3\u030aNi(Q)\u2192lH(Q) =\nl\u03b1\nH\nNj l\u0304\u03b2\nHH t\u0304\nNi\nQ\nNi\nQ\n+ l\u03b1\nH l\u0304\u03b2\nH H t\u0304\nNi\nQ\nNi\nQ\nNj \u2212 m.t.

            "text": "We may have noticed that each diagram in Eq. (2.11) comes with two left-handed quarks in an identical state \u2013 a contribution that may seem nonsense. Nevertheless, we must include those terms to achieve infrared finiteness [15, 19]. To better understand their physical origin, let us compare the cuts of a higher-order diagram contributing to the Ni \u2192 lH asymmetry\nl\u03b1\nH\nNj l\u0304\u03b2\nHH t\u0304\nNi Ni\nQ\n\u2212 m.t. (3.1)\nto the first term in Eq. (2.11). Up to a relative minus sign, the only difference between the two contributions is the presence of the f\u030aQ in the NiQ \u2192 lHQ asymmetry due to the definition of the circled rates in Eq. (1.5). In the previous section, the Higgs thermal mass entered via anomalous thresholds shown in Fig. 1. Here, we observe that including the diagrams in Eq. (2.11) brings quantum statistics in. Considering higher winding numbers of the Q line, cutting them accordingly, and summing the geometric series of Eq. (1.12) eventually generates a complete 1\u2212 fQ statistical factor in the respective cut. Next, we can open the same Q line in Eq. (3.1) without crossing, obtaining the NiQ\u0304 \u2192 lHQ\u0304 asymmetry contribution\nl\u03b1\nH\nNj l\u0304\u03b2\nHH t\u0304\nNi\nQ\u0304\nNi\nQ\u0304\n\u2212 m.t. (3.2)\nLet us add the cuts of the diagrams in Eqs. (2.11) and (3.2) together, including the Q line windings. The result can be seen as the zero-temperature Q propagator in Eq. (3.1) extended with an extra term that corresponds to the medium contribution [50]\ni p2Q + i \u2192 i p2Q + i \u2212 2\u03c0fQ(|p0Q|)\u03b4(p2Q). (3.3)\nThis observation uncovers the true nature of the cuttings in Eq. (2.11) necessary for infrared finiteness [15, 19]. The appearance of quantum statistics implies that the naive separation into a quantum description of the interactions and classical treatment of a many-body system does not survive the inclusion of higher-order perturbative corrections. In fact, when considering the cuttings in Eq. (2.11) using the classical-rate recipe of Eq. (1.5), we were computing quantum thermal corrections without knowing it. This turns out to be a consequence of the density matrix evolution, sketched in Eq. (1.11) and discussed in the last section of Ref. [11] in more detail."

            "text": "Turning our attention back to the mass-derivative from the classical rate asymmetries in Eq. (2.11), we can generalize the procedure to include quantum densities and statistical factors.\n\u2013 8 \u2013\nThe uncircled NiQ \u2192 lHQ asymmetry receives the contribution from Eq. (2.2) and the diagrams obtained by winding the propagators and external lines. Usually, the winding does not lead to a surprise \u2013 only powers of circled densities are produced. This can be observed in Figs. 2a and 2b, where w = 1 and w = 2 cases for the external Q line are shown, respectively. In both these cut diagrams, the S-matrix elements are the same as in Fig. 1a. However, we need to check if steps from Eq. (2.2) to Eq. (2.5) can be reproduced for nonzero winding numbers of the Higgs lines, as shown in Figs. 2c and 2d. These two diagrams formally contribute to the circled NiHQ \u2192 lHHQ asymmetry. Summing over all winding numbers, the uncircled NiQ \u2192 lHQ asymmetry contribution will be obtained. Cutting the diagram in Fig. 2c according to Eq. (1.4) leads to\n\u2206\u03b3\u030a (2c) NiHQ\u2192lHHQ =\nl\u03b1 Nj l\u0304\u03b2\nH\u0304\nt\nH\nNi\nQ\nNi\nQ\n+\nl\u03b1 Nj l\u0304\u03b2\nH\u0304\nt\nH\nNi\nQ\nNi\nQ\n(3.4)\n\u2212\nl\u03b1 Nj l\u0304\u03b2\nH\u0304\nt\nH\nNi\nQ\nNi\nQ\n\u2212 m.t.\nwhere, unlike in Eq. (2.2), the second and third diagrams cancel each other. We are thus left with the first term only, in which the second Higgs line remains uncut.\nThe diagram in Fig. 2d can be cut in more distinct ways, that, after several cancelations,\n\u2013 9 \u2013\ncan be reduced to\n\u2206\u03b3\u030a (2d) NiHQ\u2192lHHQ =\nl\u03b1\nH\nNj l\u0304\u03b2\nH\u0304\nt\nNi\nQ\nNi\nQ\n\u2212\nl\u03b1\nH\nNj l\u0304\u03b2\nH\u0304\nt\nNi\nQ\nNi\nQ\n\u2212 m.t. (3.5)\nWe may finally add Eq. (3.5) to the remaining first diagram of Eq. (3.4). Employing Eq. (2.4) for the uncut Higgs propagators, the diagram with three cuts is canceled, resulting in the expression\n\u2206\u03b3\u030a (2c) NiHQ\u2192lHHQ + \u2206\u03b3\u030a (2d) NiHQ\u2192lHHQ = 2P.V.\nl\u03b1\nH\nNj l\u0304\u03b2\nH\u0304\nt\nNi\nQ\nNi\nQ\n\u2212 m.t. (3.6)\nwith the same structure as seen in Eq. (2.5). Again, compared to the lowest-winding-number diagram, only an extra factor of f\u030aH appears in Eq. (3.6). The reader may verify, perhaps after some practice in drawing and cutting, that the same happens for any set of winding numbers. The inclusion of all windings then effectively leads to the replacement of the initial-state circled densities\nf\u030aNi f\u030aQ \u2192 fNifQ(1 + fH)(1\u2212 fl)(1 + fH\u0304)(1\u2212 fl\u0304) (3.7)\nmade in Eq. (2.5). The uncircled asymmetry derived from Fig. 1a can now be written as\n\u2206\u03b3 (1a) NiQ\u2192lHQ =12Y 2 t \u222b [dpNi ][dpQ]fNifQ \u2211 j 6=i Im(Y \u2020Y )2ij (2\u03c0)d\u22122 2MiMj M2i \u2212M2j\n(3.8)\n\u00d7 \u00b54\u2212d \u222b ddkF(k0,k) 2\u03b4+(k2)P.V. 1\nk2\nwhere k denotes the Higgs four-momentum, \u00b5 is a mass scale introduced to preserve the correct dimension of the expression, and\nF(k0,k) =\u03b4+[(pNi \u2212 k)2][1 + fH(k0)][1\u2212 fl(ENi \u2212 k0)] 2pQ.k\n2pQ.k + k2 (3.9) \u00d7 \u00b54\u2212d \u222b\n[dpH\u0304 ][dpl\u0304] (2\u03c0) d\u03b4(d)(pNi \u2212 pl\u0304 \u2212 pH\u0304) (pH\u0304 \u2212 k) 2(1 + fH\u0304)(1\u2212 fl\u0304).\nHere the energy dependence of the phase-space densities is only explicit when necessary. Further inclusion of uncircled asymmetries from cuttings of the diagrams in Figs. 1b-1d and their windings extends function F(k0,k) to a more complicated expression proportional to\n2pQ.k\n2pQ.k + k2 +\n2pQ.k\n2pQ.k \u2212 k2 . (3.10)\n\u2013 10 \u2013\nEmploying the identity in Eq. (2.6) and [12]\n\u2202\n\u2202k0 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 k0=|k| F(k0,k) (k0 + |k|)2 = \u2202 \u2202m2H \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 mH=0 F(Ek,k) 2Ek for Ek = \u221a m2H + k 2 (3.11)\nthe result can be transformed into a mass-derivative. The expression in Eq. (3.10) vanishes when derived as in Eq. (3.11), and may be replaced by an overall factor of two. The rest will not depend on the Q momentum, and thermal mass [43, 51]\nm2H,Yt(T ) = 12Y 2 t \u222b [dpQ]fQ = 1\n4 Y 2t T 2 (3.12)\ncan be factored out. Finally, we can write\n\u2206\u03b3NiQ\u2192lHQ = \u2206\u03b3Ni(Q)\u2192lH(Q) + 1\n4 m2H,Yt(T )\n\u2202\n\u2202m2H \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 m2H=0 \u2206\u03b3Ni\u2192lH (3.13)\nwith quantum-corrected asymmetries, in which the statistical factors in the intermediate states are included.\n3.2 NiQ asymmetries and unitarity constraints\nFrom the general considerations of the first section, we may expect the sum of all equilibrium asymmetries with the NiQ initial state to vanish. However, Eq. (1.4) offers a more powerful tool, as we can now track the asymmetry cancelations in pairs. The equilibrium NiQ \u2192 lHQ asymmetry from the diagram in Fig. 1a, shown in Eq. (2.2), is canceled by the part of the NiQ \u2192 l\u0304H\u0304Q asymmetry originating from the mirrored diagram in Eq. (2.3). The roles of the original and mirrored terms in these two contributions are exchanged, and thus, they come with opposite signs. Similarly, both diagrams in Figs. 1a and 1b lead to the NiQ\u2192 lt rate asymmetry from\n\u03b3\u030aNiQ\u2192lt =\nl\u03b1\nH\nNj l\u0304\u03b2\nH\u0304\nt\nH\nNi\nQ\nNi\nQ\n+\nl\u03b1\nH Nj l\u0304\u03b2\nH\u0304\nt\nH\nNi\nQ\nNi\nQ\n\u2212 m.t. (3.14)\ncanceled by the Ni(Q)\u2192 l\u0304H\u0304(Q) contribution from the respective mirrored diagrams. Combining everything together, we can derive the CPT and unitarity constraints [19]\n\u2206\u03b3\u030aNiQ\u2192lt + \u2206\u03b3\u030aNiQ\u2192lHQ + \u2206\u03b3\u030aNiQ\u2192l\u0304H\u0304Q + \u2206\u03b3\u030aNiQ\u2192l\u0304QQt\u0304 = 0. (3.15)\nHere the asymmetries, even though obtained within the classical kinetic theory, come with thermal-mass effects and a quantum statistical factor from the Ni \u2192 l\u0304Qt\u0304 decay asymmetry. This factor is obtained from\n\u03b3\u030aNiQ\u2192l\u0304QQt\u0304 =\nl\u0304\u03b2 Nj\nH\nl\u03b1\nH H t\u0304\nNi\nQ\nNi\nQ\n+\nl\u0304\u03b2\nNj\nH\nl\u03b1H H t\u0304\nNi\nQ\nNi\nQ\n\u2212 m.t. (3.16)\n\u2013 11 \u2013\nwith the mirrored terms shown in Eq. (2.11). The remarkable appearance of quantumness in higher-order CPT and unitarity constraints, earmarked in the abstract, is explicit now. The uncircled asymmetries differ from the circled ones by the replacements similar to Eq. (3.7). They can be transformed into infinite sequences of zero-temperature contributions of particular winding numbers in each forward-scattering diagram. For each set of winding numbers, a relation similar to Eq. (3.14) can be derived. Therefore, the uncircled asymmetries obey\n\u2206\u03b3NiQ\u2192lt + \u2206\u03b3Ni(Q)\u2192lH(Q) + \u2206\u03b3Ni(Q)\u2192l\u0304H\u0304(Q) + \u2206\u03b3NiQ\u2192l\u0304QQt\u0304 = 0 (3.17)\nwhere we used Eq. (3.13) to separate the mass-derivative of the leading-order part\n\u2206\u03b3Ni\u2192lH + \u2206\u03b3Ni\u2192l\u0304H\u0304 (3.18)\nvanishing independently. The second and third terms in Eq. (3.17) correspond to the fQ part of the 1 \u2212 fQ statistical factor appearing in the top-Yukawa corrections to the CP violating loops in the Ni \u2192 lH and Ni \u2192 l\u0304H\u0304 decay asymmetries, similar to Eq. (2.11) for the lowest-winding number case. In equilibrium, these are canceled by the NiQ \u2192 lt asymmetry together with a part the final-state statistical factor in the Ni \u2192 l\u0304Qt\u0304 asymmetry."

            "text": "In this work, we have derived the CPT and unitarity constraints for higher-order CP asymmetries within the seesaw type-I leptogenesis model. The right-handed neutrino and lefthanded top quark initial states have been used as an example. The inclusion of quantum thermal corrections makes tracking equilibrium asymmetry cancelations difficult, as the onshell parts of the propagators, which are essential to the asymmetry generation, are modified by quantum statistical factors. The obstacles have been overcome in two stages. First, we employed the holomorphic cutting rules [16\u201318], which allow for a diagrammatic representation of CP asymmetries at higher perturbative orders [19]. Then, cylindrical diagrams with all possible winding numbers of internal lines have been cut to systematically account for quantum thermal effects in reaction rates and their asymmetries [11]. Finally, the CPT and unitarity constraints, including thermal-mass effects and quantum statistics in both final states and asymmetry-generating loops, have been presented."

We also would like to thank our colleague Fedor S\u030cimkovic for his long-term support.\nA Circled asymmetries from the NiQ anomalous thresholds\nIn this appendix, we present the explicit results for the asymmetry in Eq. (2.2) and analogous cuts of the diagrams in Figs. 1b-1d. To regularize infrared divergences, we can perform the\n\u2013 12 \u2013\ncalculation in d dimensions, leading to\n\u2206\u03b3\u030a (1a) NiQ\u2192lHQ =12Y 2 t \u222b [dpNi ][dpQ]f\u030aNi f\u030aQ \u039b2d (4\u03c0)d\u22122 \u2211 j 6=i Im(Y \u2020Y )2ij (A.1)\n\u00d7 MiMj M2i \u2212M2j\n[ d\u2212 2 + 1\nd\u2212 4 2M2i s\u2212M2i ] where s = (pNi + pQ) 2 and\n\u039bd = 1\n2 ( Mi \u00b5 )d\u22124 \u0393(d/2\u2212 1) \u0393(d\u2212 3)\n(A.2)\nwith a scale \u00b5 fixing the dimension. For the rest of the NiQ\u2192 lHQ asymmetry contributions, the second line in Eq. (A.1) has to be replaced by\nMj Mi\n[ \u2212 1 +\nM2j M2i ln\n( 1 +\nM2i M2j\n) + ( d\u2212 3 + 1\nd\u2212 4 2M2i s\u2212M2i\n) F (M2j /M 2 i ) ] (A.3)\nMiMj M2i \u2212M2j\n[ d\u2212 2\u2212 1\nd\u2212 4 2M2i s\u2212M2i\n] (A.4)\nMj Mi\n[ \u2212 1 +\nM2j M2i ln\n( 1 +\nM2i M2j\n) + ( d\u2212 3\u2212 1\nd\u2212 4 2M2i s\u2212M2i\n) F (M2j /M 2 i ) ] (A.5)\nto reproduce the asymmetries from Figs. 1b, 1c, and 1d, respectively. The auxiliary function F (M2j /M 2 i ) is defined as\nF (x) = 1\u2212 (1 + x) ln(1 + 1/x) +O(d\u2212 4). (A.6)\nUsing Eqs. (A.1)-(A.5), we may verify that in four dimensions, the resulting asymmetry in Eq. (2.9) is obtained.\nB Infrared singularities and finite quark mass\nAnother way to deal with infrared singularities is to assign a small mass m to Q and t particles as in Refs. [12, 42]. In that case, the thermal part of the Higgs wave-function renormalization does not vanish, and we need to modify the mass-derivative relations in Eqs. (2.12) and (3.13). In analogy to the zero-temperature case, we define a circled Higgs self-energy\n\u2212i\u03a0\u030aT (k0,k) = H H\nt\nQ Q\n+ H H\nt\nQ\u0304 Q\u0304\n+ H H\nt\u0304 t\u0304\nQ\u0304\n+ H H\nt t\nQ\u0304\n. (B.1)\nwhere each quark or antiquark line includes momentum integration with circled density and summation over the discrete degrees of freedom. Correspondingly, the thermal mass and wave-function renormalization factor [12]\nm\u030a2H,Yt(T ) =\u03a0\u030aT (k 0,k)|k0=|k| = 12Y 2t \u222b [dpQ]f\u030aQ (B.2)\n\u03b4Z\u030aH,Yt(T ) = 1 2|k| \u2202 \u2202k0 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 k0=|k| Re\u03a0\u030aT (k 0,k) = \u22126Y 2t \u222b [dpQ]f\u030aQ m2 (k.pQ)2 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 k0=|k|\n(B.3)\n\u2013 13 \u2013\ncan be introduced, while the full thermal quantities are obtained via the inclusion of all higher winding numbers of the quark lines.

(B.4)\nresults from the diagrams with two scalar (Higgs or anti-Higgs) cut lines. In each of them and from each side of the cut, the factor of \u03b4Z\u030aH,Yt(T )/2 adds to the O(Y 4Y 2t ) asymmetries\n\u2206\u03b3\u030a\u03b4ZNi\u2192lH =12Y 2 t \u222b [dpNi ][dpQ]f\u030aNi f\u030aQ \u2211 j 6=i Im(Y \u2020Y )2ij 4\u03c02\n(B.5)\n\u00d7 Mj Mi\n[ M2i\nM2i \u2212M2j + 1\u2212\n( 1 +\nM2j M2i\n) ln ( 1 +\nM2i M2j\n)] .\nThe contributions from Figs. 1a-1d are now equal to\n\u2206\u03b3\u030a (1a) NiQ\u2192lHQ =3Y 2 t \u222b [dpNi ][dpQ]f\u030aNi f\u030aQ \u2211 j 6=i Im(Y \u2020Y )2ij 16\u03c02\n(B.6)\n\u00d7 MiMj M2i \u2212M2j\n[ 1 + s\nM2i \u2212 M\n2 i\ns\u2212M2i\n( ln\nM2i s\u2212M2i + ln m Mi )] \u2206\u03b3\u030a\n(1b) NiQ\u2192lHQ =3Y 2 t \u222b [dpNi ][dpQ]f\u030aNi f\u030aQ \u2211 j 6=i Im(Y \u2020Y )2ij 16\u03c02 Mj Mi [ \u2212 1 2 ln ( 1 + M2i M2j ) (B.7)\n+\n( s\nM2i \u2212 M\n2 i\ns\u2212M2i\n( ln\nM2i s\u2212M2i + ln m Mi\n)) F (M2j /M 2 i ) ] \u2206\u03b3\u030a\n(1c) NiQ\u2192lHQ =3Y 2 t \u222b [dpNi ][dpQ]f\u030aNi f\u030aQ \u2211 j 6=i Im(Y \u2020Y )2ij 16\u03c02\n(B.8)\n\u00d7 MiMj M2i \u2212M2j\n[ 3\u2212 s\nM2i + M2i s\u2212M2i\n( ln\nM2i s\u2212M2i + ln m Mi )] \u2206\u03b3\u030a\n(1d) NiQ\u2192lHQ =3Y 2 t \u222b [dpNi ][dpQ]f\u030aNi f\u030aQ \u2211 j 6=i Im(Y \u2020Y )2ij 16\u03c02 Mj Mi [ \u2212 1 2 ln ( 1 + M2i M2j ) (B.9)\n+ ( 2\u2212 s\nM2i + M2i s\u2212M2i\n( ln\nM2i s\u2212M2i + ln m Mi\n)) F (M2j /M 2 i ) ] and their sum, independent of m, is infrared finite. We can easily observe that it includes both the mass-derivative and the wave-function renormalization, as shown in Eq. (B.5). The formula in Eq.
