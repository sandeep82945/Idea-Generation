Advanced Morphology Control and Defect Engineering Techniques: Future research could focus on developing more precise and controlled methods for manipulating the morphology and creating defects in MoS2 catalysts. Investigating novel physical or chemical exfoliation techniques that can efficiently produce few-layer or monolayer MoS2 with high uniformity and yield could be pivotal. Additionally, exploring new methods for defect engineering, such as targeted etching or ion implantation, to create specific types of defects that enhance catalytic activity and selectivity would be valuable.

Exploration of Novel Metal Doping and Bimetallic Catalysts: While the review highlights the effectiveness of Co and Pt doping in improving HDO activity, future studies could explore the potential of other metals or combinations of metals in doping MoS2. Research could aim to identify new synergistic effects between MoS2 and other transition metals or rare earth elements, aiming to optimize the catalytic performance further and understand the underlying mechanisms at play.

Deactivation Mechanism Elucidation and Countermeasures: Although the review touches on sulfur loss and coking as deactivation mechanisms, comprehensive studies to understand these processes in greater detail are needed. Future research could aim to elucidate the microscopic processes leading to catalyst deactivation and develop novel strategies to counteract these mechanisms, such as advanced surface modification techniques, development of more robust catalyst structures, or innovative reactor designs that minimize deactivation risks.

Sustainable and Scalable Synthesis Methods for Unsupported MoS2 Catalysts: The review suggests various synthesis methods for MoS2 catalysts, including hydrothermal and solution-based approaches. Future research could focus on green synthesis methods that are more environmentally friendly and cost-effective, aiming for scalability and industrial applicability. Investigating the use of bio-based solvents, renewable energy sources for synthesis processes, and waste-derived materials as precursors for MoS2 synthesis could be highly impactful.

System Integration and Process Optimization for Bio-Oil Upgrading: Beyond catalyst development, future research could explore the integration of MoS2-based catalysts into complete systems for bio-oil upgrading, addressing challenges related to process engineering, reactor design, and the integration of HDO with other bio-oil processing steps. Studies could focus on optimizing process conditions, improving the efficiency and selectivity of bio-oil upgrading, and developing pilot-scale demonstrations to validate the technology's commercial viability.
