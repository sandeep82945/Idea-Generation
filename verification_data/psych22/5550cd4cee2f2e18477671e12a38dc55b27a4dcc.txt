"In the light of psychotherapies’ equivalent paradox— ‘treatments have equivalently positive outcomes despite non-equivalent theories and techniques’ (Stiles et al., 2008)— FSTR could help enhance treatment outcomes and the (cost-)effectiveness of psychotherapy for adolescents with personality disorders. As adolescents with low FSTR had little chance of positive outcome regardless of any improvement in the therapeutic relationship, it is worth considering stopping the treatment in consultation with the patient and family. A frank discussion with the patient and their parents about the low probability of a positive outcome provides an opportunity to adjust or stop the treatment, and to look for a more suitable treatment."
