However, in the last decade, LAB was under extensive study because of its potential to synthesize EPSs of high molecular weight,3 serve as a probiotic with other nutritional attributes, offer protection against bowel disorders, diarrhea, and allergies as well as boost the immune system.4 Many benecial effects including antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inammatory, antiviral, immunomodulatory, antitumor,\nalth and Nutritional Sciences, Research\nIslamabad, Pakistan.

Previously, single-factor optimization, i.e. change of one factor at a time keeping the other factors constant, has been used for bioprocess optimization. However, this method could not assess the affect between the interactions of the factors. Therefore, this has been done through appropriate statistical designs such as central composite rotatory design (CCRD) and response surface methodology (RSM) in recent years to optimize the conditions of a targeted response.8\nLactic acid food fermentation is an old process, whereby microbes convert fermentable sugars into lactic acid in the food substrate and other limited products via enzymatic activities. \u201cKanji\u201d is one of the fermentation products made from black carrots (Daucus carota), which is commonly consumed in the Indo-Pak subcontinent. Black carrots are rich in anthocyanin pigment with high antioxidant activity.

This drink is popular as a remedy for indigestion, anorexia and liver disorders. It is consumed extensively in the early summer season as an appetizer.9\nDespite the obvious benecial effects of black carrots and their drink, there are not many studies available in the literature on their processing. Although LAB has been explored in the kanji, the production of EPSs under optimized conditions has not been reported yet. Therefore, keeping in view the economic production of EPSs through LAB from fermentation products, this present study aimed to isolate LAB from kanji, explore the EPS-producing LAB and optimize the media composition for maximum EPS yield by the Plackett\u2013Burman design and response surface methodology. The fractional characterization and antioxidant potential of the selected lactic acid strain have also been studied."

Several L. brevis strains with probiotic nature have been reported previously.4,23,24 L. brevis B13-2 isolated from Chinese Kimchi revealed tolerance against bile salts and acids in an articial gastric environment and adhered to HT-29 cells.22 Moreover, probiotic attributes, especially resistance to bile, were linked with production of EPSs from L. brevis strain25 and indicated the probiotic behavior of the isolated strain."

Based on the PB design (Table S1\u2020), a tted rst-order model, presenting the correlation among the 11 variables and EPS production could be described as follows:\nY \u00f0EPS\u00de \u00bc 8:37\u00fe 0:5225X1 0:0610X2 0:137X3 \u00fe 0:652X4 \u00fe 0:0102X5 0:0815X6 0:4773X7 \u00fe 0:2219X8 0:393X9 0:545X10 \u00fe 0:1034X11\n(5)\nwhere Y was denoted as the yield of EPSs and Xi are the coded independent variable values and the coefficient of each variable representing the extent of the effect on EPS yield. The linear regression coefficient R2 was found to be 0.9957, and adjusted coefficient determination was adj-R2 = 0.9724, indicating that the variability of the data in the response yield could be well presented by the model. In this case, the p-values for the ve variables (glucose, sucrose, tryptone, CaCl2 and K2HPO4) were <0.05, indicating that these independent variables were the important factors that affect the EPS production (Table 4). The signicance of factors decreased in the following order: sucrose\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

It is evident that sucrose, yeast extract and peptone enhanced the yield of EPSs synthesized by Leuconostoc dextranicum NRRL B-1146 strain to increase the EPS yield. Similarly, in another study, tryptone and sucrose had a great impact on the yield of EPSs from Leuconostoc mesenteroides DRP105.12 Ref. 26 reported that Levilactobacillus sakei predominantly utilized glucose as a major carbon source for EPS production. It was earlier reported that glucose appeared as a better substrate than lactose for more EPS yields by Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus.27 In a recent study, it has been concluded that addition of CaCl2 increases the EPS yield without altering the growth of Lactobacillus plantarum K25 strain.28 Furthermore, by the addition of K2HPO4, a signicant increase could be seen in the EPS yield from 438 mg L\u22121 to 1673 mg L\u22121 by L. rhamnosus.29"

The regression coefficient values were found to be R2 = 0.9327 and nonsignicant lack of t value (p = 0.3848).

It is important to mention here that as per the general accepted notion whenever the ratio is bigger than ten (10), it indicates that transformation is required; however, if the ratio is <3%, the power transform has little effects. Therefore, in this background, the obtained results of experiment were adequate. The model equation was validated by performing one experiment under the conditions existing within the experimental range. The optimized value of tested independent factors was 10.56% glucose, 9.23% sucrose, 0.75% tryptone, 0.446% CaCl2 and 0.385% K2HPO4.

Moreover, aer heating, the cell-bound polysaccharide was also liberated in the medium and increased the overall yield. Similarly, further purication steps such as acidic/basic treatment and dialysis also played a signicant role in the purication of extracted EPSs. The total sugar content was found to be 96.45 \u00b1 0.06 g. 100\u22121 g while the absence of protein or nucleic acid resulted in a response to the Bradford test in the UV spectrum of 280 nm and 260 nm. Similarly, the total carbohydrate content in EPSs produced by Lactobacillus plantarum YW11 was reported to be 92.35%,10 and that in EPS produced by Lactobacillus helviticus MB2-1 was 95.45%.13"

Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nspectroscopy. Hydroxyl group stretching from glycosides was depicted at a wave number of 3275.48 cm\u22121, as reported previously.33 The peak at 2919.62 cm\u22121 was related to the C\u2013H stretching vibration. The indication of absorption bands of C\u2013C group stretching was also visible at 1644.73 cm\u22121. The band ranging from 1320 to 1000(s) wave numbers specically represented carboxylic acids, alcohols, ether and ester groups (C\u2013O), showing the typical attributes for polysaccharide. Therefore, in the present study, a sharp peak at 1010.61 cm\u22121 indicated the C\u2013O stretching vibration (Fig. 3). It may also be deduced that the appearance of stretching absorption at 1147 cm\u22121 assured the presence of b-1-4 glycosidic linkage. This absorption frequency at 1147 cm\u22121 is due to characteristic antisymmetric stretching of the b C1\u2013O\u2013C4 bond. The absence of peak in the range of 850 cm\u22121 depicted the absence of a linkage in the exopolysaccharide.34 Thus, it was shown that the produced EPS is an intricate polysaccharide having various functional groups, as reported earlier in various studies.14\n3.8 Monosaccharide composition and molecular weight (Mw)\nThe monosaccharide composition analysis depicted that NCCP 963 EPS was homopolysaccharide in nature (Fig. 4a), consisting of only glucose monomers.

As for the DPPH radical scavenging activity of NCCP 963 was concerned, an increasing trend was observed with the increase in concentration ranging from 0 to 10 mg mL\u22121, as shown in Fig. 5a. Maximum activity was found to be 88.45% at the concentration level of 10 mg mL\u22121 with an EC50 value of 1.56 mg mL\n\u22121. This is due to the existence of hydroxyl and other functional groups in the EPS-producing strain that may give electrons for the reduction of free radicals into a more stable form.12 In the present study, this activity of the EPS was found to be 6% higher than the EPS formed from L. plantarum LP6 (ref. 41) and almost similar, 88.60%, to the EPS isolated form L. plantarum C88.42\n3.9.2 ABTSc+ radical scavenging activity. ABTS radical scavenging activity is a convenient model to assess the antioxidant activity of organic compounds such as exopolysaccharide from Lactobacillus strains.41 In the present study, all of the levels displayed unpredictable levels of antioxidant activity in a dosedependent manner, as shown in Fig. 5b. The ABTS rate was found to be closer to that of the reference control at 0.8 mg mL\u22121 and an EC50 value of 0.31 mg mL\n\u22121, which showed signicant ABTS radical activity even at a very low concentration in comparison to other kinds of EPSs reported earlier.43,44 When it was compared with the DPPH activity, it was found that the EPS employed stronger ABTS scavenge radical ability, due to the diversied properties of the radical model. Naturally isolated EPSs possessed abundant hydroxyl groups essential for the antioxidant activity, which provides electrons for the reduction of radicals into a more stable form or may interact with free radicals to break the chain reaction of radicals.45 Moreover, it is also reported that high levels of protein content and a low molecular weight also had the same effect on the antioxidant\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nactivities8,42 radical scavenging activities; (c) hydroxyl radical scavenging activities; and (d) superoxide radical scavenging activities.\n3.9.3 Hydroxyl radical scavenging activity. The hydroxyl antioxidant activity of isolated EPSs and ascorbic acid (used as standard) is depicted in Fig. 5c. The maximum activity was found at the level of 86.78% at 10mgmL\u22121 with an EC50 value of 2.1 mg mL\u22121 and ndings were more or less similar, as previously reported in the literature.41 The reaction mechanism of the EPS in hunting hydroxyl radicals seemed to be different from the ABTS and DPPH radicals. The hydroxyl antioxidant capability of the EPS is attributed to inhibited to the free production of OH groups by chelating metallic ions such as Cu+2 and Fe+2.46 As per the ndings of the present study, the behaviors of hydroxyl groups and the DPPH activity of exopolysaccharide were almost similar. However, the ABTS radical scavenging activity was found to be different. This varied behavior of the EPS may be attributed to multiple mechanisms such as binding to transition metal ion catalysts, prevention of chain initiation, and breakdown of peroxides.2\n3.9.4 Superoxide anion scavenging activity. Biological macromolecules and tissue damage could also be caused by the presence of superoxide radicals with the generation of other ROS species such as hydroxyl radicals, singlet oxygen and H2O2 that further lead to severe oxidative damage to living cells.41 The ndings indicating the superoxide radical scavenging activity with different concentrations of EPSs are presented in Fig. 5d. A similar trend of dose dependence was found as other antioxidant activity models, with the highest rate of 82.45% at 10 mg mL\u22121 and an EC50 value of 6.7 mgmL\n\u22121.

Hence, they could be used in yogurt and dahi industry as an adjunct culture. Generally, solidication of 10% skim milk is difficult because of the low protein content and lactic acid formed by fermenting bacteria.48 Addition of 3% sucrose in skim milk is also attributed to interactions between proteins and EPSs, present in milk.21,31\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

The obtained EPS was homopolysaccharide in nature with a high molecular weight. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of sugar fractions. The signicant antioxidant potential with a high free radical scavenging capacity of DPPH, ABTS, hydroxyl, and superoxide alluded towards high potential usage in the pharmaceutical industry. Levilactobacillus brevis NCCP 963 has a high molecular weight of 5.48 \u00d7 104 Da. Based on the characterization data, the extracted EPS have a great potential to be used in dairy, yoghurt or similar industries, in which the hydrocolloid nature of product is required.\nAbbreviations\nEPS\n\u00a9 2023 The\nExopolysaccharide\nAuthor(s).
