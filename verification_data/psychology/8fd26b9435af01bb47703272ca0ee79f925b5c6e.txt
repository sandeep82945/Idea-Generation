"To summarize, further research is needed to better understand the concentration range of various cations in cardiomyocytes, a topic which is still is largely unknown, which makes it challenging to assess their potential toxic effects."

"Therefore, it is necessary to study whether cardiac troponin C and atrial and ventricular myosin regulatory light chains could be potential targets for these cations."

"Therefore, further investigation is necessary to fully understand the possibility of cations binding by a myosin ATP-binding pocket."

"It is important to consider the possibility that ATPase activity may be influenced not only by cation interactions with the myosin ATP-binding pocket but also by metal binding to the RLC."

"We hope that our review will help to provide direction for further investigations."
