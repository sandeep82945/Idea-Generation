1. **Investigate the effect of different culture conditions on the activity and selectivity of KstD2NS in Mycolicibacterium strains.** This could include varying the temperature, pH, and carbon source to optimize the bioconversion process and minimize the formation of undesirable byproducts.


2. **Explore the use of different Mycolicibacterium strains as hosts for heterologous expression of KstD2NS.** Different strains may have different metabolic capabilities and regulatory mechanisms that could affect the activity and selectivity of KstD2NS.


3. **Investigate the potential of KstD2NS to catalyze the 1(2)-dehydrogenation of other steroids, including those with different functional groups and ring structures.** This could expand the range of steroid substrates that can be converted using this enzyme.


4. **Study the mechanism of action of KstD2NS and identify the key amino acid residues involved in its catalytic activity and substrate specificity.** This information could be used to engineer improved variants of KstD2NS with higher activity and selectivity.


5. **Develop a scalable bioprocess for the production of 1(2)-dehydrosteroids using recombinant Mycolicibacterium strains expressing KstD2NS.** This could involve optimizing the fermentation conditions, developing efficient cell immobilization strategies, and integrating the bioconversion process with downstream purification and isolation steps.
