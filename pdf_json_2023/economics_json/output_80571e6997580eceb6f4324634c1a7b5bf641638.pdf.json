Additionally, SF 16 oxytocin leads to an economic burden on the healthcare system and society due to increased 17 treatment costs and productivity losses from sickness and premature death. While oxytocin is 18 widely accessible, there are concerns about its quality and the burden of SF oxytocin remains 19 understudied. 20 OBJECTIVE 21 To develop an impact model to estimate the health and economic burden of SF oxytocin in 22 Kenya. This paper presents the methodology and the findings of assessing SF oxytocin in Kenya. 23 METHODS 24 A decision tree model was developed to compare health outcomes and costs with and without SF 25 oxytocin from a healthcare sector and societal perspective. This model incorporates healthcare 26 seeking behavior, epidemiological parameters, medicine quality, health outcomes and costs. The 27 main assumption of the model is that lower active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) percentage 28 results in lower medicine efficacy. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate parameter 29 uncertainty. 30 FINDINGS 31 For 1.1 million pregnant patients delivering in a healthcare facility in Kenya and a 7% 32 prevalence of oxytocin with 75%-90% API, the model estimates that the presence of SF oxytocin 33 in Kenya is associated with 1,484 additional cases of mild PPH, 583 additional cases of severe PPH, 34 15 hysterectomies, 32 deaths, 633 DALYs accrued, 560 QALYs lost, and 594 years of life lost 35 yearly. The economic burden of SF oxytocin was $1,970,013 USD from a societal perspective,\n.

            "text": "43 1. INTRODUCTION 44 45 Maternal mortality is a major global health concern, especially in low- and middle-income 46 countries (LMICs).(1) Although global maternal mortality declined by 38% between 2000 and 2017, 47 it still remains alarmingly high. Each year, nearly 295,000 women die during and following 48 pregnancy and childbirth with 94% of these deaths occurring in LMICs.(1) In Kenya, the death rate 49 for pregnancy-related causes is 355 per 100,000 live births.(2) This equals approximately 5,000 girls 50 and women dying annually of pregnancy and childbirth complications, most of which could be 51 prevented.(3) 52 Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), defined as a blood loss of 500mL or more following 53 childbirth, is a leading direct cause of maternal mortality globally, accounting for 27.1% of all 54 maternal deaths.(4) Over 14 million women experience PPH every year causing 70,000 maternal 55 deaths due to bleeding complications related to pregnancy and childbirth.(5) Women who survive 56 PPH are at subsequent risk for severe maternal morbidities including organ dysfunctions and long57 term disabilities.(6,7) When PPH occurs, early identification and management of bleeding using 58 evidence-based guidelines can prevent most PPH-related severe complications and deaths.(8) 59 According to guidelines, the use of uterotonics is key for both the prevention and management of 60 PPH. Specifically, oxytocin is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the drug 61 of choice for preventing and treating PPH. (9) Oxytocin is included in the WHO Essential Medicines 62 list and in the United Nations Commission on Life-Saving commodities for Women and Children 63 list. (9\u201311) 64 While oxytocin is widely accessible, there are concerns about its quality in LMICs. 65 (10,12,13) A systematic review of the literature reported a median prevalence of 45.6% (range 0-\n.

(13) One study conducted in Ghana 68 reported that 74% of oxytocin purchased at private pharmacies did not meet manufacturer 69 specifications for percentage of API.(14) Due to lack of sufficient reporting on medication quality, 70 inconsistencies in study sampling methods and variability in product testing, the estimates of SF 71 oxytocin prevalence have limitations and are likely \u201cjust a small fraction of the total problem\u201d.(15) 72 Research groups have estimated the health and economic impact of selected SF medicines 73 especially antimalarials and antibiotics. However, the burden of SF oxytocin remains an 74 understudied problem.(16,17) A review of specific causes of maternal deaths in Kenya showed that 75 PPH is an issue that needs to be addressed and that over 80% of maternal deaths are attributed to 76 poor quality of care. (18,19) In recognition of the need to combat the threat of SF medicines and to 77 improve the quality of PPH care, we developed a comprehensive disease model to generate country78 specific evidence on the health and economic burden of SF oxytocin used for the prevention and 79 treatment of PPH among pregnant women from the first stage of labor until discharge or maternal 80 death. This paper describes the methodology of the model and findings for Kenya."

In the model, each group receives a prophylactic dose of oxytocin as recommended by 98 the WHO for PPH prevention. (9) 99 Model Inputs 100 There are four quality categories of oxytocin based on the percentage of the active pharmaceutical 101 ingredient (API): 102  Standard quality: 90 -110% of the API as defined by the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) 103 (28) 104 \u25cf Substandard quality and falsified level 1 (SF1): 75 \u2013 89% of the API required by the USP 105 standard (28) 106 \u25cf Substandard quality and falsified level 2 (SF2): 50 \u2013 74% of the API required by the USP 107 standard (21) 108 \u25cf Substandard quality and falsified level 3 (SF3): < 50% of the API required by the USP 109 standard (21) 110 A proportion of providers are expected to increase the dose (up dose) category SF1, SF2 or SF3 111 drugs based on a study that found that 41% of the healthcare providers at a healthcare facility in 112 Nigeria doubled the WHO-recommended dose and 10% used two to six vials instead of one to 113 achieve the desired outcome.(29) 114 After the initial prophylactic dose, a woman can either have an adequate response to the treatment 115 and is discharged or she can experience mild PPH (blood loss <500mL) (9,30) and is given another 116 dose of oxytocin as a first line of PPH treatment following WHO and UK guidelines.(31\u201333) After\n.

Incremental cases of 126 mild PPH, severe PPH, hysterectomies and deaths were obtained by multiplying branch probabilities 127 for each health outcome for the real-world scenario and for the ideal-world scenario and the 128 difference was calculated. 129 The decision tree incorporates the following health states: 130 1- Delivery, with no complications 131 2- Delivery, with mild PPH 132 3- Severe PPH without hysterectomy 133 4- Severe PPH with hysterectomy 134 5- Maternal death 135 Each of these health states was associated with a utility and a disability weight. Utility weights were 136 obtained from a cost-effectiveness study comparing oxytocin and carbetocin where EQ-5D-5L was 137 used to collect primary data on vaginal and cesarian deliveries with and without PPH that was then 138 converted to utility scores.(36) Utility weights for hysterectomy and secondary infertility were 139 obtained from cost-effectiveness studies examining the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding and\n.

After the six weeks, we assumed 143 that the utility weight retuned to 1, i.e., \u201cperfect health\u201d, for all the aforementioned health states, 144 except for severe PPH with hysterectomies, where the utility weight for secondary infertility was 145 assigned for the remaining of the woman\u2019s lifetime.(38) 146 We estimated YLLs associated with each health state then and QALYs and DALYs were calculated 147 by multiplying the number of years that the women were expected to be alive (converted from the 148 six-week cycle length used in the analysis) by utility scores and disability weights, respectively. 149 Six categories of model inputs were included: health-seeking behavior, epidemiological parameters, 150 medicine quality, treatment efficacy, outcome measures and costs. Health-seeking behavior inputs 151 consist of the percentage of women who have a healthcare facility delivery in the private, public or 152 faith-based sector. Epidemiological parameters include the annual number of pregnant women 153 delivering in healthcare facilities, percentage of hospitals and health centers and/or clinics in the 154 public and private sector, probability of hysterectomy if severe PPH occurs, probability of PPH155 related mortality and probability of dying by age (using life tables). Medicine quality inputs include 156 the percentage of standard quality medicines and percentage of SF medicines depending on their 157 levels of API. Treatment efficacy included oxytocin treatment effects, probabilities of mild and 158 severe PPH with and without oxytocin, and outcomes measures included health state utilities and 159 disability weights. 160 We gathered these inputs from peer-reviewed literature, public institutions, recent Kenya 161 Demographics and Health Surveys data (DHS) and secondary data collection from in-country 162 stakeholders in Kenya.(2) The secondary data was obtained through Kenyan subject matter experts\n.

The prevalence of SF medicines specifically 164 was the best available estimate provided by them; however, it is based on a small sample size for the 165 entire country, which makes the input highly uncertain. 166 As for cost inputs, using healthcare sector and societal perspectives, direct and indirect costs were 167 considered in the analysis. The direct medical costs included were drug costs, labor costs 168 (corresponding to time spent by healthcare providers) and hospital costs associated with 169 hospitalizations, operating units, blood transfusions, invasive procedures, and hysterectomy costs. 170 Direct medical costs were either derived from the literature or secondary data collection from a 171 Kenyan technical working group. Indirect costs consisted of productivity losses incurred by patients 172 due to days missed at work or premature maternal death. Productivity losses were estimated using 173 the human capital approach based on gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, duration of lost 174 productivity, and rate of employment. Productivity losses due to premature death were also estimated 175 using the human capital approach, life of years lost and employment rate.(39) All monetary units 176 were converted from Kenyan Shillings (KES) to US Dollars (USD) using the average annual 177 exchange rate for 2022 (1 USD = 122.935 KES) and were rounded to the nearest thousands. (40) 178 Base case inputs were identified as the \u201cmost likely\u201d estimates for each data input. For each 179 parameter, we also identified an uncertainty range to capture potential variation from base case 180 values.

(21) This assumption states that standard 199 quality medicines have 100% medicine efficacy. Medicines in the SF level 1 category with API 200 between 75 and 89%, have a 30% efficacy reduction. Medicines in the SF 2 category with API 201 between 50 and 74%, have a 60% efficacy reduction and medicines in the SF 3 category with API 202 less than 50%, have 100% efficacy reduction, i.e., equivalent to not receiving treatment. 203 Additionally, we assumed that oxytocin was the only uterotonic used for the prevention and 204 management of PPH and that the background risk factors for PPH were comparable among women 205 in the real-world scenario and ideal-world scenario. 206 Sensitivity analyses 207 To quantify the impact of parametric uncertainty on model results, a one-way sensitivity 208 analysis (OWSA) and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) were performed. 209 For each outcome, an OWSA assessed the influence of uncertainty in individual model parameters 210 on model results. This was achieved by varying each fixed parameter around the maximum and 211 minimum of its uncertainty interval and plotting the model results in a Tornado diagram. 212 The PSA was conducted to evaluate the range of plausible outcomes given joint uncertainty 213 in all inputs. We used Monte Carlo simulations with 10,000 iterations, where inputs were randomly 214 and simultaneously generated within a specific distribution.(65) Epidemiological inputs were 215 assumed to be normally distributed. Probabilities and percentages were assumed to have a beta 216 distribution for binomial data inputs or a Dirichlet distribution for multinomial data inputs. Cost 217 inputs were assumed to have a gamma distribution. 218 Model Validation\n.

(66) First, we verified that the model was parsimonious and sufficient to answer 222 the research question by incorporating the main assumptions about SF medicines and the current 223 care of disease progression and treatment strategies.(67) Because there are no other model that 224 examined SF oxytocin specifically, this was performed by comparing our model characteristics and 225 structure to existing models and approaches that estimated the impact of SF medicines and economic 226 evaluations of different uterotonics for the prophylaxis and treatment of PPH during third stage of 227 labor. 228 We assessed internal validity and consistency by checking that the mathematical equations, 229 calculations and code were accurate and consistent with the specifications of the model. 230 We performed external validation and consistency, whereby we compared the model outputs for the 231 real-world scenario with current in-country maternal outcomes to ensure that the model adequately 232 reflects the current situation in Kenya. This was performed by comparing the existing estimates of 233 number of PPH episodes, hysterectomies and PPH-related deaths in Kenya as a benchmark for our 234 model predictions. 235 Three technical working group meetings were held with key stakeholders from Kenya between 236 January and December 2021 to gather subject matter experts\u2019 opinion on data inputs for the model 237 and assumptions. All data inputs and uncertainty ranges were reviewed and discussed by local 238 experts and policymakers 239 from public health and public policy agencies and universities to reach consensus on the most locally 240 representative and recent data to be used in the model.\n.

            "text": "287 The decision tree model can be used to estimate the health and economic burden of SF 288 oxytocin in Kenya from the healthcare sector and societal perspectives. The model follows a cohort 289 of pregnant women of mean childbearing age in a real-world scenario where SF oxytocin is 290 compared to an ideal-world scenario without SF oxytocin. In both scenarios, the model incorporates 291 women\u2019s care-seeking behaviors, their mode of delivery, the progression from first to third stage of 292 labor and its management, the treatment outcomes, and associated costs. 293 Our findings indicate that every year, the presence of 7% SF oxytocin with API between 294 75% and 89% in Kenya contributes to the burden of PPH, the leading cause of maternal mortality in 295 the country, with a total of 10,580 episodes of severe bleeding due to SF oxytocin under base case 296 assumptions. A recent study using the Kenyan Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths (CEMD), 297 a database that includes all maternal deaths reported through the District Health Information system 298 (DHIS2), recently estimated that between 2014 and 2017, 728 deaths of a total of 2,292 maternal 299 deaths were due to PPH, or an average of 182 PPH-related death, annually.(68) Data frames and 300 time periods are different, so comparison should be cautious, but contrasting these findings with our 301 model estimates of 105 deaths due to PPH per year indicates that SF oxytocin may be contributing 302 significantly to annual PPH-related maternal mortality in Kenya. (68) That is particularly important 303 as the 7% prevalence of SF is highly uncertain and may not be representative of exposures across 304 the country. This input was based on the Kenyan technical group\u2019s expertise and not empirical 305 studies. The samples collected for medicine quality assessments by the Pharmacy and Poison Board 306 are typically small (n=100s) for the entire country and across many different pharmaceutical 307 categories. Because our findings are based on the assumed prevalence of 7% SF oxytocin, it is 308 important to interpret the findings of this study cautiously. Uncertainty was incorporated in the\n.

The economic burden of SF oxytocin is also 312 substantial as our model estimates that almost USD $8 million are expended on direct and indirect 313 costs every year due to SF medications. In our analysis, the main cost drivers are the management 314 of severe PPH, followed by productivity losses due to premature deaths. Despite the common 315 practice of updosing in Kenya, our model estimated that drug costs constituted only 0.5% of the 316 total cost of PPH management. These findings align with a study conducted in the United Kingdom 317 that found that drug costs also only accounted for 0.5% of the total cost of PPH management, 318 suggesting that the bulk of direct costs is allocated to medical procedures and to staff labor 319 necessary to stop severe PPH. (69) 320 Our model builds upon previous efforts by Bath et al. and Ozawa et al. that estimated the 321 health and economic burden of antimalarials and antibiotics. (21,70) For example, the efficacy 322 reduction assumption utilized in these models are comparable to the assumptions we use. However, 323 there are several limitations in our model. Our model uses decision tree modeling and cannot account 324 for national, regional and patient-specific variations, i.e., heterogeneity within the cohort of pregnant 325 women. However, we can change the mean age and the number of pregnancies of a cohort. Several 326 studies found that hypertension, prolonged labor, advanced maternal age, multiple pregnancies were 327 among the most common risk factors for PPH. (71\u201373) Because the same population is entering the 328 model in two different scenarios, i.e., real-world and ideal-world scenario, the distribution of risk 329 factors for PPH among women is similar; therefore, these factors are not accounted for in the model. 330 Another limitation of our analysis is that we assumed that oxytocin was the only uterotonic used for 331 the management of third stage labor, as it is WHO\u2019s recommendation for the prevention and\n.

We are not accounting for women who may be receiving other uterotonics 333 such as misoprostol, carbetocin or ergometrin. With this approach, we may be overestimating the 334 cost of maternal healthcare as oxytocin is more expensive to acquire, store and handle than some of 335 the other uterotonics used for the same purpose. Oxytocin may also not always be the best option 336 especially for women with pre-existing conditions or complications such as hypertension, heart 337 disease or allergies so we may also be overestimating maternal health outcomes. Lastly, the quality 338 of the data inputs inherently limits the findings of our model. We performed an extensive literature 339 search to ensure the most recent and highest quality peer-reviewed data were used. We also held 340 three meetings with subject matter experts from Kenya to validate all data inputs and their ranges to 341 ensure local relevance and performed a OWSA and a PSA with wide ranges to address uncertainty. 342 Our oxytocin-specific model can be used in Kenya and other countries where maternal mortality 343 is high to provide country-specific estimates of avertable health outcomes and costs due to SF 344 oxytocin or to evaluate the impact of interventions combatting SF oxytocin. The findings can be 345 leveraged by policy makers to respond with an evidence-based strategy to combat SF oxytocin at 346 the country level."
