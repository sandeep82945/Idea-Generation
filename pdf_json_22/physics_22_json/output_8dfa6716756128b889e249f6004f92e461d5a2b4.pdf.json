    "abstractText": "We study continuous variable systems, in which quantum and classical degrees of freedom are combined and treated on the same footing. Thus all systems, including the inputs or outputs to a channel, may be quantum-classical hybrids. This allows a unified treatment of a large variety of quantum operations involving measurements or dependence on classical parameters. The basic variables are given by canonical operators with scalar commutators. Some variables may commute with all others and hence generate a classical subsystem. We systematically study the class of \u201cquasifree\u201d operations, which are characterized equivalently either by an intertwining condition for phase-space translations or by the requirement that, in the Heisenberg picture, Weyl operators are mapped to multiples of Weyl operators. This includes the well-known Gaussian operations, evolutions with quadratic Hamiltonians, and \u201clinear Bosonic channels\u201d, but allows for much more general kinds of noise. For example, all states are quasifree. We sketch the analysis of quasifree preparation, measurement, repeated observation, cloning, teleportation, dense coding, the setup for the classical limit, and some aspects of irreversible dynamics, together with the precise salient tradeoffs of uncertainty, error, and disturbance. Although the spaces of observables and states are infinite dimensional for every non-trivial system that we consider, we treat the technicalities related to this in a uniform and conclusive way, providing a calculus that is both easy to use and fully rigorous. The data defining a quasifree channel are, first, a linear map from the output phase space to the input phase space, which describes how the Weyl operators are connected. The second element is a scalar \u201cnoise factor\u201d, which is usually needed to make the channel completely positive. Channels with noise factor 1 are called noiseless. These are homomorphisms in the Heisenberg picture. For any quasifree channel, the admissible noise functions are in one-to-one correspondence to states on a certain hybrid system. Since many basic tasks (e.g., joint measurement, cloning, or teleportation) are encoded in the linear phase space map, this gives a compact characterization of the possible noises for channels implementing the task. We establish a general Stinespring-like decomposition of any quasifree channel into the expansion by an additional system followed by a noiseless operation. The additional system is itself a hybrid and in the state characterizing the noise. This allows a clear distinction between classical and quantum noise of the channel. Technically, our main contribution is the clarification of the functional analysis of the spaces of states observables and channels. This required the resolution of a mismatch in the standard approaches to classical and quantum systems, respectively, which would have bogged down the theory with many case distinctions. In the scheme that we propose all hybrid systems and quasifree operations are treated in a uniform manner. For example, the noise analysis of dense coding and teleportation become virtually identical. All quasifree channels can equivalently be considered in the Schr\u00f6dinger picture or in a variety of Heisenberg pictures differing by the degree of smoothness demanded of the observables.",

Werner\nInstitut f\u00fcr Theoretische Physik, Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover, Germany June, 2023\nWe study continuous variable systems, in which quantum and classical degrees of freedom are combined and treated on the same footing. Thus all systems, including the inputs or outputs to a channel, may be quantum-classical hybrids. This allows a unified treatment of a large variety of quantum operations involving measurements or dependence on classical parameters. The basic variables are given by canonical operators with scalar commutators. Some variables may commute with all others and hence generate a classical subsystem. We systematically study the class of \u201cquasifree\u201d operations, which are characterized equivalently either by an intertwining condition for phase-space translations or by the requirement that, in the Heisenberg picture, Weyl operators are mapped to multiples of Weyl operators. This includes the well-known Gaussian operations, evolutions with quadratic Hamiltonians, and \u201clinear Bosonic channels\u201d, but allows for much more general kinds of noise. For example, all states are quasifree. We sketch the analysis of quasifree preparation, measurement, repeated observation, cloning, teleportation, dense coding, the setup for the classical limit, and some aspects of irreversible dynamics, together with the precise salient tradeoffs of uncertainty, error, and disturbance. Although the spaces of observables and states are infinite dimensional for every non-trivial system that we consider, we treat the technicalities related to this in a uniform and conclusive way, providing a calculus that is both easy to use and fully rigorous.\nThe data defining a quasifree channel are, first, a linear map from the output phase space to the input phase space, which describes how the Weyl operators are connected. The second element is a scalar \u201cnoise factor\u201d, which is usually needed to make the channel completely positive. Channels with noise factor 1 are called noiseless. These are homomorphisms in the Heisenberg picture. For any quasifree channel, the admissible noise functions are in one-to-one correspondence to states on a certain hybrid system. Since many basic tasks (e.g., joint measurement, cloning, or teleportation) are encoded in the linear phase space map, this gives a compact characterization of the possible noises for channels implementing the task. We establish a general Stinespring-like decomposition of any quasifree channel into the expansion by an additional system followed by a noiseless operation. The additional system is itself a hybrid and in the state characterizing the noise. This allows a clear distinction between classical and quantum noise of the channel.\nTechnically, our main contribution is the clarification of the functional analysis of the spaces of states observables and channels. This required the resolution of a mismatch in the standard approaches to classical and quantum systems, respectively, which would have bogged down the theory with many case distinctions. In the scheme that we propose all hybrid systems and quasifree operations are treated in a uniform manner. For example, the noise analysis of dense coding and teleportation become virtually identical. All quasifree channels can equivalently be considered in the Schr\u00f6dinger picture or in a variety of Heisenberg pictures differing by the degree of smoothness demanded of the observables.\nLars Dammeier: lars.dammeier@itp.uni-hannover.de Reinhard F.

            "text": "Canonical variables such as position and momentum can be defined in terms of their commutation relations. As von Neumann showed [1], for finitely many degrees of freedom, this uniquely fixes the standard description of a quantum system in a Hilbert space with explicitly given operators. This approach turns out to be very useful also for studying operations on such systems. For example, a symplectic linear transformation of the underlying phase space gives just another set of operators with the same commutation relations. Hence by von Neumann\u2019s Theorem, there must be a unitary implementing it. Here we generalize this approach in two directions: On one hand, we also allow dissipative operations, which turn some pure states into mixed states, and which are given by completely positive maps. On the other, we include a classical part described by operators commuting with all others, allowing for general quantum-classical hybrid systems. This allows treating problems with a mixture of classical and quantum information, such as various measurement scenarios. The defining property of the channels which can be studied in this way is that they intertwine two actions of the phase space translations or, equivalently, take Weyl operators into Weyl operators. Such operations have been called quasifree [2, 3]. However, an analytic treatment in the generality needed for a practical calculus and including hybrid systems does not seem to exist. It will be provided in this paper.\nWhile the main aim is to build an easy-to-use general calculus for quasifree hybrids, we had to go deeper into the functional analysis of such systems than we had anticipated. The reason is that, although the formal structures for states and observables for purely quantum systems and for the purely classical systems (probability) are well established, this cannot be said for the hybrid combination. Indeed, the standard approaches for the two extreme cases are not easily merged. These problems are aggravated when discussing operations (channels) between systems: Should they be described in the Schr\u00f6dinger or the Heisenberg picture? On which spaces should these act? Our answer is a setting, in which both pictures always make sense, for any quasifree channel. So in the practical calculus of quasifree channels, the technicalities and the conceptual issues, whose resolution forms the main body of this paper, can be taken as resolved. When questions of analytic properties of observables and channels come into play, details can be taken from our paper, but for many questions, these details can be ignored, and the calculus can be used and applied straightforwardly and rigorously to a large variety of measuring and control scenarios. It strictly includes the world of \u201cGaussian Quantum Information\u201d. But we no longer need separate definitions of Gaussian states and Gaussian measurements: Gaussianness is a property of arbitrary channel types, and it is immediate from our definition that the composition of Gaussian channels is again Gaussian. However, the quasifree setting is richer, including, for example, arbitrary channels with no input, i.e., arbitrary states.\nOur paper is organized as follows: We finish the introductory Sect. 1 with three subsections placing our problem in context. Logically they can be skipped, i.e., they contain no material needed to follow the formal development in later chapters. First (Sect. 1.1), we have some general remarks on how to choose good spaces of states and observables, how this issue has been viewed traditionally, and why hybrids pose a special challenge. We then (Sect. 1.2) give a very brief overview of the rich literature on the canonical commutation relations, mainly for the historical background and pointers to useful summaries. We do not take knowledge of this literature as a prerequisite, however. The body of the paper is mostly self-contained, i.e., we give arguments for the main steps, even when they could also be covered by a citation. The literature on quantum-classical hybrids, reviewed in Sect. 1.3, is more disparate, even including some approaches that fail. We provide a list of pertinent research projects with brief discussions of some aspects. We also note how these projects relate to our paper. The three background sections can be summarized by saying that we did not find any works covering all three aspects.\nAfter introducing the basic phase space variables, Sect. 2 deals with the \u201cgood states\u201d. Using the terminology introduced later, these are the ones with continuous characteristic functions (Thm. 4), and turn out to be the state space of a C*-algebra without unit, denoted C\u2217(\u039e, \u03c3). Observables are treated in Sect. 3. This is the most technical part of the paper. Here we get different choices of spaces of observables. Each is represented as a class of functions from the classical parameter\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-04, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 3\nspace to the bounded operators of the quantum subsystem with varying degrees of regularity, e.g., weak measurability, strong*-continuity, and norm continuity. The aim is to show later that these properties are preserved under arbitrary quasifree channels. A direct approach would be fraught with case distinctions concerning the separation and recombination of classical and quantum parts under the channel. Therefore we go another way (Sect. 3.1), namely giving a characterization of these properties in a general operator algebraic setting, which applies to classical, quantum, and hybrid systems alike. The preservation of properties is then almost trivial to show (Prop. 26).\nQuasifree channels are defined and characterized in Sect. 4. In order to get a feeling for the large variety of operations covered by that definition, we recommend skipping ahead to Sect. 5 for examples. Meanwhile, Sect. 4 focuses on general constructions. Basic ways to combine them are described in Sect. 4.6. A recurring theme is a correspondence between the quasifree channel and a state that we call its noise state. The complete positivity condition is exactly equivalent to the positivity condition for this state, which is a state on an explicitly given hybrid system. This may have a classical part, or may be entirely classical, even for channels between purely quantum systems. Thus the hybrid work needs to be done even if one wants to study only quantum channels. A key result is the factorization of any quasifree channel into preparing the noise state on some environment and then executing a noiseless quasifree operation, for which the noise state is pure and classical. Noiseless operations (Sect. 4.7) are homomorphisms, so this is a variant of the Stinespring dilation.\nSect. 5 sketches some of the possibilities of combining classical and quantum information in input and output. In particular, we parameterize covariant phase space instruments and their characteristic tradeoff between measurement accuracy and disturbance. Some aspects, like optimal cloning, the classical limit, and dynamical semigroup evolutions, are only sketched because they are treated in past or future articles of their own. In these cases, we merely indicate how these subjects fit into the framework."

            "heading": "1.1 The basic problem: Good spaces for states and observables",
            "text": "The basic statistical interpretation of quantum theory has two primitives, states and observables, which operationally stand for preparations and measurements. Mathematically they are represented in appropriate ordered Banach spaces, and the basic interpretation demands that there is a bilinear form allowing to evaluate the expectation value of any observable in any given state. In all the usual theories, however, this symmetric view is broken, and either the states or the observables are taken as primary and the dual objects as secondary, derived quantities. This section is about that chicken-and-egg situation. It is of special interest for hybrids since, in the end, we will settle for a third option.\nThe standard view of quantum mechanics has states described as density operators (positive trace class operators of trace 1 on a Hilbert space H). The maximal set of observables for which expectation value evaluations can be defined is the set of all bounded linear functionals on the trace class T (H), i.e., the Banach space dual, which in this case is equal to B(H), the space of bounded operators on H, where the expectation values are expressed by tr(\u03c1A) for \u03c1 \u2208 T (H) and A \u2208 B(H). For classical systems, two different choices are common. One can either take the algebra C(X) of continuous complex-valued functions on a compact space X as the observables. The dual then consists of all finite Borel measures on X. Or else, one can take the space L1(X,\u00b5) of probability densities with respect to some reference measure as the space of states, of which the dual is L\u221e(X,\u00b5). These basic options are visualized in Fig. 1.\nIn the classical case, the structure of C(X) is determined by the topology of X, whereas the structure of L1 is based on the measure theory of (X,\u00b5). In the non-classical setting of operator algebraic quantum theory [4, 5, 6, 7, 8] the distinction appears as the contrast between the C*algebraic approach, which generalizes the topological side, and the W*-algebraic approach, which generalizes the measure-theoretic side. As indicated by the letters C and W, the distinction is one between the abstract versions of norm closed *-subalgebras of B(H) versus weakly closed ones (also called von Neumann algebras). Then a famous characterization theorem [9] links this distinction to the chicken-and-egg problem mentioned in the first paragraph: The W*-algebras are precisely those C*-algebras that are dual Banach spaces, i.e., coincide with all bounded linear functionals on some state space.\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-04, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 4\nAs the classical case shows, neither view is in any sense more \u201ccorrect\u201d than the other: Topology and measure theory just capture different aspects of the system description. Curiously, one of the founding papers of the algebraic quantum field theory (AQFT) school [10] tries to make the point that the C*-algebras should be taken as primary. However, the arguments presented there can be straightforwardly dualized to give the dual conclusion, namely, that the states should be taken as primary. Luckily, the AQFT school has largely ignored the advice of [10], and did substantial work singling out subsets of \u201cphysically relevant states\u201d and separating the local part of the problem from the global aspects by defining canonical W*-algebras for local regions, while analyzing the structure at infinity (superselection sectors) in terms of the representation theory of a quasilocal C*-algebra. So it can be said that the mature version of AQFT [5] takes a rather refined and complex view of chicken and egg.\nIn axiomatic quantum mechanics, many schools have focused on the finite-dimensional case, where the problem does not arise: In that case, the spaces are reflexive, i.e., equal to their second duals. One traditional school allowing infinite dimension from the outset is the approach by Ludwig [11, 12]. According to him, a complete picture of quantum mechanics should be symmetric, even though his axiomatic reconstruction just returns the asymmetric standard view shown in Fig. 1. The problem of choosing an appropriate space of physically realizable observables (D \u2282 B(H) in Ludwig\u2019s notation) is left as an open problem. It is not one to be solved once and for all. A solution will have to depend on further specifics of the system [13]. This is analogous to the classical case: All L1-spaces are isomorphic (if X has no \u201catoms\u201d, i.e., points of positive measure, [14, Thm. III.1.22]), so the measure theory does not even see the dimension of X. Similarly, T (H) depends only on dim H, but any reasonable D will contain more structure.\nA minimal condition on a space of observables is that there are sufficiently many observables to distinguish the states. With only this minimal condition, it is guaranteed that the weak limits of observables span the full dual of the state space. That is, all choices are weak* dense in each other. One might use this to justify an asymmetric scenario including all these limits as idealized observable elements. However, what gets lost in this asymmetric picture is a description of the physical distinguishability of states. Therefore one loses the idealized states one would similarly find in the dual of the observable space. This is, in fact, the basis of the argument in [10], only that it works both ways (see [15] for a formal parallel development of both aspects from the Ludwig point of view). This symmetric view can be seen very clearly in the classical case (Fig. 1): Starting from just the bottom duality of probability densities and continuous functions, we can approximate arbitrary measures weakly by densities, including point measures. Dually we can take weak* limits in L\u221e to approximate arbitrary bounded measurable functions by continuous ones. Again we gain additional extremal elements, like indicator functions, which are typically not continuous. However, there is no natural evaluation of a point probability measure on an indicator function in L\u221e: The elements of L\u221e are classes with respect to almost everywhere equality, and so the value at a point (typically of measure zero) is not defined. Thus there is no natural pairing at the top level of the diagram of dualities (see, however, [16] for the existence of some non-constructive pairing). In the non-commutative case, the story is similar: By going to the full dual spaces, one gains\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-04, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 5\nidealized elements in the form of pure states and projections, whose abundance is guaranteed by the Banach\u2013Alaoglu and Krein\u2013Milman Theorems. These extremal elements are often the building blocks of an analysis, as in the decomposition of arbitrary states as an integral over pure states (Choquet Theory, [4, Ch. 4]) and, dually, in the spectral resolution of normal observables.\nThe explanation for the existence of pure states does not account for the many pure states |\u03c8\u27e9\u27e8\u03c8| \u2208 T (H), i.e., standard quantum mechanics, which we characterized as an instance of the W*-view. Indeed for W*-algebras of Murray\u2013von Neumann type II and III, there are no normal pure states (see also Lem. 10). However, the pure states can be related to another duality: The trace class T (H) is the Banach space dual of K(H), the space of compact operators. The unit ball of T (H), therefore, has to have many extreme points. It would be impractical, however, to use the compact operators as the basic observable algebra: It does not contain a unit, so we cannot express the normalization condition for POVM observables.\nThat 1I /\u2208 K(H) means that the normalization functional is not continuous in the weak* topology, so the states are not a weak*-closed subset of the unit ball and not compact. This is a crucial observation for limits in this topology. For example, consider a sequence of states averaged over an expanding range of spatial translations. Any cluster point would have to be translation invariant; but no such density operator exists, because translations have continuous spectrum. On the other hand, by the weak* compactness of the unit ball, cluster points must exist. Indeed the weak* limit is the zero functional. So it does happen that the limit of states fails to be a state. In close analogy, we can consider classical states represented by probability measures on Rn and their shifts or averages to infinity. These are in the dual of C0(Rn), the space of continuous functions vanishing at \u221e, and weak limits of shifted sequences are zero.\nSo in both cases, the natural state space can be located in the dual of an algebra A without identity, namely A = K(H) in the quantum case, and A = C0(Rn) in the classical case. But this does not mean going back to an asymmetric picture with observables taken as primary, i.e., another turn in the chicken-and-egg conundrum because A is not itself the algebra of observables. The full set of observables will be some set of functionals on the states in A\u2217, so a subspace of A\u2217\u2217. All such observables can be approximated weakly by elements of A. In particular, there is an approximate unit, so 1I is recovered. This scheme is outlined in Fig. 2. We propose to use it for hybrids, as well, and with the particular choice A = K(H) \u2297 C0(X) as the C*-tensor product of quantum and classical parts.\nIt turns out that this is equivalent to another way of identifying a good hybrid state space for systems of canonical variables. One takes, for each state, the expectation values of the Weyl operators (displacement operators). This is called the characteristic function of the state. Then the good states in A\u2217 are precisely (Thm. 4 and 5) those with a continuous characteristic function (usually called \u201cregular\u201d). Intuitively, these states live essentially in bounded regions of phase space, so the expectation of Weyl operators can be expected to depend continuously on its argument. This is in contrast to the observation that distinct Weyl operators have maximal norm distance because somewhere far out, even periodic functions with very similar periods will differ maximally. This regularity condition has an equally simple analog for quasifree channels, which is equivalent to the channel mapping regular states to regular states. We include this in our definition of quasifree channels. On the side of observables, things are more complex, however. On the maximal choice\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-04, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 6\nof observable algebra, the bidual A\u2217\u2217 the Heisenberg picture of a channel is defined as the Banach space adjoint. However, the bidual is a monster, even in the classical case. We devote Sect. 3 to the task of finding smaller, more manageable subalgebras, which nevertheless support a Heisenberg picture for arbitrary quasifree channels. That there is some choice here is a strength of our theory rather than a weakness: It amounts to a variety of analytic conditions (weak measurability, strong*continuity, norm continuity, and in some sense many more), which are all automatically preserved by the Heisenberg actions of quasifree channels.\nLet us contrast this with an approach that naively takes inspiration from the finite case, where dim H < \u221e, and the classical variables lie in a compact set X, and the appropriate observable algebra is the C*-tensor product A = B(H)\u2297C(X). WhenX \u223c= Rs locally compact and dim H = \u221e, we could just replace C(X) by the bounded continuous functions Cb(X), and consider the C*algebra A\u0303 = B(H) \u2297 Cb(X). This algebra contains the Weyl operators as well, so we can associate with every state on A\u0303 a characteristic function. In fact, we started our investigation of quasifree channels with this choice, running into more and more difficulties: Since the Weyl operators do not span a norm dense subalgebra of A\u0303, the characteristic function will fail to characterize a state. Moreover, many states on A\u0303 are singular in the following sense: The classical marginal will be a state on Cb(X), which is isomorphic to C(\u03b2X), where the \u03b2X denotes the Stone\u2013\u010cech compactification of X. But if such a state has any weight on the infinite points \u03b2X \\X, it will not be a probability measure on X. Similarly, on the quantum side, a state on B(H) may fail to be given by a density operator. For a usable calculus of quasifree channels, this is bad news because it would be unclear how to even define such channels on all of A\u0303, how to exclude that the output of any such operation is singular, and even if all that is worked out, whether the Heisenberg picture would map into the input counterpart of A\u0303."

            "text": "The description of physical systems in terms of canonical commutation relations constitutes a core part of modern mathematical physics. The tradition begins with Weyl and von Neumann and extends to the community that founded the journal Communications in Mathematical Physics in 1965. It was felt then that this structure, and more generally a C*-algebraic view of physics, was a key element of both quantum field theory in the approach of Haag, Kastler [17, 10], and Araki [18], and of statistical mechanics in the school of Verbeure and others (see [4, 19] for a textbook expounding these ideas). We are obviously building on this tradition and can hardly give due credit, not even to the major contributors.\nNotable expositions are [19] for a Fock space based view with statistical mechanics in mind and [20] for a field theoretical one. An encyclopedic work aiming at quantum optics is [21]. Irreversible operations, i.e., quasifree channels as developed in Sect. 4, came up in [3, 22]. These are, of course, also the focus of works on quantum information. In that community, the canonical systems are called systems with \u201ccontinuous variables\u201d as opposed to those composed of discrete quantum bits. The main interest has been in the Gaussian case because the vacuum at the empty port of a beam splitter, laser light, and cooled oscillators are all Gaussian. A collection of review articles is [23]. Systematic expositions of the Gaussian structure are [24, Ch. 12] and [25].\nHybrids did show up occasionally in this literature, but usually not as the main focus. For example, some core results in [21] are formulated without assuming the commutation form to be non-degenerate (see also [26]). This assumes the observable algebra on the classical side to be CCR-like, i.e., the almost periodic functions, which is not a good choice by the considerations of the previous section, but by far the most frequent choice in the literature described here."

The motivations are rather different, and after each brief description, we point out how the respective research project differs from the present study.\nQuantum Field Theory In quantum field theory, the algebra of canonical commutation relations provided a way to deal with the commutation relations of field operators in QFT without\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-04, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 7\ndiscussing tricky domain questions of these unbounded operators. In this way, quantum fields could be included in the newly forming C*-algebraic approach to quantum mechanics, which is crucially based on bounded operators. However, these works were not interested in going beyond the CCR-algebra, i.e., the C*-algebra generated by the Weyl operators. The technical difficulties coming from an infinite-dimensional test function space (phase space) and the resulting failure of von Neumann\u2019s uniqueness theorem (closely related to \u201cHaag\u2019s Theorem\u201d) seemed more relevant.\nIt was noted only later that even for field theory, the CCR-algebra has its drawbacks. Classically it corresponds [27] to the almost periodic functions, which by definition depend very sensitively on infinite values of the fields. This is reflected by the structure of the pure states on the algebra of almost periodic functions, which form the so-called Bohr compactification of R. Along with the points in R it contains further limit points. But these new points are in no sense \u201cat infinity\u201d and themselves dense, so that the finite and the infinite are highly intertwined. Of course, this is related to the observation that almost periodic classical variables are almost impossible to measure, so the topology of the Bohr compactification is unrelated to physical distinguishability. The same criticism applies to the use of the CCR-algebra. In particular, it is difficult to implement physical dynamics as a C*-dynamical system on this algebra [19, p. 345]. A more regular approach using resolvents rather than exponentials of the fields has therefore been proposed [28] (cf. Example 28).\nIn contrast to the QFT literature, we consider only finite-dimensional phase spaces in this paper. In other aspects, our approach is more general, particularly by including irreversible operations. QFT focuses on reversible dynamics, so irreversible operations play no role (but see [29]).\nHybrids and canonical structure Both classical and quantum systems employ Hamiltonians to generate the dynamics, and it appears almost like a minor difference that one uses commutators while the other uses Poisson brackets. Consequently, there have been many attempts to fuse these structures into one common framework (see [30] for a review). This gains further plausibility from systems with quadratic Hamiltonians, which generate isomorphic Lie algebras in the quantum and classical worlds. On the whole, however, this basic idea has proved to be a failure [31, 32]. Typical problems include dynamics, which do not preserve the positivity of states or allow non-local signaling due to some obscure non-linearity imported into the quantum system from the classical side. The core of these problems is actually a very familiar No-Go Theorem from quantum information theory: There is no information gain without disturbance [33]. That is, whenever an interaction leads to the possibility of measuring a variable of the classical subsystem and thereby gaining information about the initial quantum state, some irreversibility must be involved. Thinking of dynamics in terms of Hamiltonians and canonical structure is, however, so tied up with reversible dynamics that any approach based on canonical structures is bound to fail, at the latest, when there is a non-trivial interaction.\nFor our paper, this has the consequence that we do not even assume a symplectic structure on the classical system, i.e., the classical phase space is a real vector space without further structure.\nDissipation The No-Go Theorem strongly suggests the use of dissipative time evolutions to express the measurement interaction [34, 35, 36]. The quasifree case [35] benefits especially from the clarification of the complete-positivity conditions for channels ([22], our Sect. 4).\nIn [37], we show that, even without quasifreeness, this leads to a fusion of the classical theory of diffusion generators on one hand and Lindblad generators on the other, with a full understanding of the additional interaction terms that describe the information transfer from the quantum to the classical subsystem.\nEmbedding the classical system into a quantum one In the quantum information community, many researchers think of the observables of a classical system as the diagonal matrices embedded into a larger full matrix algebra. Similarly, for a classical particle described by position variables in Rn, one can get a quantum extension by including the generators of the spatial shifts, i.e., conjugate momenta, in a crossed-product [14] construction. This construction can be done at the von Neumann algebra level so that the enlarged quantum system has the full algebra of bounded operators over L2(Rn, dx) as observables. This is the approach to hybrids chosen, for\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-04, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 8\nexample, in [35]. In this setting, the distribution of the classical variables in a normal state always has an L1-density, which excludes the pure states of a hybrid. We will see later that the pure states of a modified hybrid also correspond to extremal quantum channels, so this approach excludes the optimal, e.g., minimal noise channels for some tasks.\nIn our approach, pure states are included from the outset, and the von Neumann algebraic crossed-product embedding is characterized as a special case for which states are norm continuous under translations (Sect. 2.7).\nThe classical system is a large quantum system A common point of view is that the classical world is merely emergent as a limiting case of large quantum systems. In this spirit, a hybrid would always be a large quantum system with one subsystem close to a thermodynamic limit. There is no problem then writing down Hamiltonian interactions between the almost classical and the quantum part. However, this does not resolve the No-Go Theorem for hybrid dynamics. The classical variables in such a system will generally evolve into some combination involving their conjugates, or as [38] phrases this, the classical variables lose their \u201cintegrity\u201d. The required physical discussion at this point would be that effectively, and to good approximation, the classical integrity is preserved. But often, the models of quantized classical systems are so simple (e.g., one degree of freedom [39]) that a physical discussion of a thermodynamic limit is not really possible. It should be noted that the classical limit is very closely related to the mean-field limit, and the latter has indeed been proposed as a model for measurement processes involving large quantum systems [40]. In this case, in spite of an infinite range mean field interaction, the measurement result becomes definite only in the infinite time limit.\nThe many-body aspect of the classical system will not come into play in our paper or even enter the formalism. Conceptually, this is because we consider that limit already being done, and we work with a much-reduced set of classical variables, a finite set of reals, such as a measurement record in a continuing observation process.\nNon-linearity In the mean-field limit, one gets dynamical equations for quantum states, which are of canonical Hamiltonian form and allow strong non-linearities forbidden in standard quantum theory. This is not paradoxical if one realizes that the \u201cquantum states\u201d here are not states of a quantum system at all but distribution parameters for a many-body system. Nevertheless, the resulting kind of non-linear Hamiltonian evolution [41, 42] has been proposed as a testable generalization of quantum mechanics [43, 44]. In the simplest case, i.e., a qubit, it is classical mechanics with the surface of the Bloch sphere as a phase space manifold and the surface 2-form as symplectic form. The standard quantum evolutions are driven by Hamiltonians which are linear in the state. These are just rotations of the Bloch sphere and result from non-interacting mean-field systems. The symplectic structure on the pure states has been variously noted, but it is quite misleading to conclude that using it somehow unifies classical and quantum theory. Indeed the classical Hamiltonian structure goes against a basic impossibility claim of standard quantum mechanics, namely that all mixtures giving the same density operator (e.g., unpolarized light) are indistinguishable. To summarize: As an approach to hybrids, the theories starting from the Hamiltonian structure of quantum states resolve the tension between classical and quantum theories by turning the quantum part into a classical system.\nIn this paper, we stick to the \u201cminimal statistical interpretation\u201d for quantum, classical, and hybrid systems alike. The states and observables then operationally represent preparations and measurements. This interpretation implies linearity of all meaningful operations on states and observables, so linearity is not an accidental feature of the theory that can easily be dropped, and we will assume it throughout.\nHybrids for gravity A recent discussion of hybrids for quantum fields coupled to gravity illustrates several of the options mentioned above. In [45, 46] we find an approach making the dissipative nature of the interaction implicit. In [47, 48] it is argued that gravitationally induced entanglement would serve as proof of the non-classical nature of gravity. This is contradicted by [49], where the authors emphasize that this will depend on the notion of hybrids and that the non-linear variant, in particular, would allow for entanglement via a classical intermediary.\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-04, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 9\nOur motivation for hybrid structures is practical and comes from continuous observation and other measurement processes. Whether the resulting structures are also helpful for some fundamental theory is far beyond the scope of this paper. However, we hope that a sharper understanding of the mathematical structures will also be helpful in such projects."

            "text": "In this section, we fix the basic structure of the systems we consider and the basic notations relating to phase spaces. For those who are familiar with phase space quantum mechanics, this amounts to applying a remarkably simple principle, namely just eliminating the assumption that the commutation form should be symplectic, i.e., non-degenerate.\nWe consider systems of n quantum canonical degrees of freedom and s classical ones. This means that we have a position variable q \u2208 Rn, and its momentum counterpart, which lies in the dual space Rn. This only means that a scalar product q\u00b7p is defined, and the phase space of the system, the set of pairs (q, p) carries a natural symplectic form \u03c3((q, p), (q\u2032, p\u2032)) = q\u00b7p\u2032 \u2212 p\u00b7q\u2032. More abstractly one needs only to demand that \u03c3 is antisymmetric and non-degenerate, i.e., the only pair (q, p) such that \u03c3((q, p), (q\u2032, p\u2032)) = 0 for all (q\u2032, p\u2032) is p = q = 0. Then with a suitable choice of \u201ccanonical coordinates\u201d \u03c3 will take the given form.\nWe now drop the assumption of non-degeneracy, i.e., we allow non-zero null vectors for \u03c3. In a basis this means that the 2n variables p, q can be augmented by 0 \u2264 s < \u221e unpaired classical variables x \u2208 Rs, which can be thought of as position variables without corresponding momenta. So, as an extended phase space \u039e = R2n+s we consider the set of triples \u03be = (q, p, x). The extended symplectic form will be defined\n\u03c3((q, p, x), (q\u2032, p\u2032, x\u2032)) = q\u00b7p\u2032 \u2212 p\u00b7q\u2032 = \u2211\nij\n\u03bei\u03c3ij\u03be \u2032 j , (1)\nwhich is still antisymmetric and bilinear. When we want to emphasize the generalization, we call \u039e a \u201chybrid phase space\u201d. But since this is the normal case in our paper, we will often drop the adjective. Since we later consider arbitrary linear maps on phase spaces, we usually adopt a convenient basis free view, where the (hybrid) phase space is just a real vector space \u039e with antisymmetric form \u03c3, so the type of system is given by the pair (\u039e, \u03c3). The classical part is always singled out as the space of null vectors:\n\u039e0 = {\u03be \u2208 \u039e | \u2200\u03b7 : \u03c3(\u03be, \u03b7) = 0}. (2)\nThus we can split \u039e = \u039e1 \u2295 \u039e0, where \u039e1 is a suitable subspace on which \u03c3 is non-degenerate, i.e., a standard quantum system. The direct sum symbol here indicates a unique decomposition \u03be = \u03be1 + \u03be0 with \u03bei \u2208 \u039ei for any vector \u03be, and that the form \u03c3 also has a block structure, as in the coordinatization (1). However, other than an orthogonal complement, the quantum part \u039e1 is not uniquely defined, i.e., there are \u03c3-preserving linear maps changing the decomposition. Some of our constructions depend on the decomposition \u039e = \u039e1 \u2295 \u039e0, but we usually do not show explicitly that this dependence is harmless. In fact, such proofs become trivial exercises once our full theory is established. The necessary isomorphisms will be noiseless quasifree in the terminology of Sect. 4.\nGoing quantum means that the components of these tuples are turned into operators\nR = (R1, . . . , R2n+s) = (Q1, . . . , Qn, P1, . . . , Pn, X1, . . . , Xs) (3)\nwith the commutation relations [Rj , Rk] = i\u03c3jk1I. (4)\nAgain, we refer to the classical Xj as \u201coperators\u201d out of convenience, although classical \u201crandom variables\u201d might perhaps be more appropriate. These are the Rj that commute with all others.\nA basic symmetry of the theory are the phase space translations, which add a constant, i.e., a multiple of the identity to each Rj . We denote this transformation by\n\u03b1\u03be(Rj) = Rj + \u03bej1I, (5)\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-04, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 10\nwhere \u03bej are the components of \u03be. Clearly, \u03b1\u03be preserves the commutation relations and will always be a homomorphism (preserve operator products).\nThere are many subtleties in the task of finding all operators satisfying (4), related to domain questions of these unbounded operators [50]. The main regularity condition singling out the usual case is that the operators are essentially selfadjoint on their common domain so that they generate unitary groups. These should satisfy an integrated version of (4), and rather than diving into the details, we will make that our starting point. In fact, it can be argued [51, Sect.4.1] that the integrated version (7) is historically a bit older, and due to Weyl, who proposed it to Max Born, even before the latter published (4). Hence, following a strong tradition, we pass to the operators\nW (\u03be) = exp(i\u03be\u00b7R). (6)\nWe refer to the W (\u03be) as Weyl operators, even though with classical arguments, they may sometimes be more like functions. In (6) the expression \u03be\u00b7R := \u2211 j \u03bejRj means a mixed vector/operator scalar product, by which the commutation relations become\nW (\u03be)W (\u03b7) = e(\u2212i/2)\u03be\u00b7\u03c3\u03b7W (\u03be + \u03b7) (7) = e\u2212i\u03be\u00b7\u03c3\u03b7W (\u03b7)W (\u03be). (8)\nWe will refer to (7) as the Weyl relation, while (8) are called the canonical commutation relations (CCR) in Weyl form. The CCR-algebra over (\u039e, \u03c3), denoted by CCR(\u039e, \u03c3), is the universal C*-algebra of these generators and relations. That is, every realization of the relations by unitary operators W (\u03be) on a Hilbert space H is given by a representation of CCR(\u039e, \u03c3) which takes the abstract generators to the W (\u03be).\nThere are some notational choices here that we should comment on. We have not included \u03c3 in (6), simply because this would set the classical contribution to zero. In phase spaces with a proper symplectic form, this form is often used to identify the space with its dual (e.g., [27]). Any constructions using this will not work in our context. This means that in a coordinate-free spirit, the variable \u03be in (6) does not lie in the phase space \u039e but in its dual \u039e\u0302. We will keep the notation simple by nevertheless identifying both spaces with R2n+s and using a dot for the standard scalar product.\nThis convention will suffice for almost all of the paper, that is, unless we explicitly distinguish some components as position-like and others as momentum-like. In those rare cases, mainly the instrument in Sect. 5.7, we try to help readers keeping track by using corresponding letters: For the phase space \u039e, and therefore also for the arguments of \u03b1\u03be we already introduced in the ordering (q, p, x) for the groups of n+ n+ s variables. For the dual space \u039e\u0302, i.e., in the arguments of Weyl operators and characteristic functions it is then suggestive to use the ordering (p\u0302, q\u0302, k). Here we take into account that position space and momentum space are dual vector spaces and k is the wave-number variable dual to classical shifts, as customary in eik\u00b7x. In order to keep all appearances of the symplectic matrix explicit, we do not change one of the signs for elements in \u039e\u0302."

            "text": "In this section we investigate the kind of hybrid theory suggested by the Hilbert space tensor product of a classical and a quantum subsystem.\nIn the quantum case, there is no choice: von Neumann showed [1] that Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s operators P and Q are the only solution of the commutation relations. As taught in every course on quantum mechanics, these live in the Hilbert space H1 = L2(Rn, dq), with Qi acting by multiplication with the ith coordinate, and Pi by differentiating with respect to it (and a factor i). Equivalently, the Weyl operators are given by(\nW1(a, b)\u03c8 ) (r) = e ia\u00b7b2 +ia\u00b7r\u03c8(r + b), for (a, b) \u2208 \u039e1, \u03c8 \u2208 H1 = L2(Rn, dr). (9)\nIn contrast, there is no such uniqueness for the classical case, basically because there are uncountably many inequivalent irreducible representations of the classical observable algebra (labelled by the points of \u039e0). This non-uniqueness forces the choice of a measure \u00b5 on the classical subspace \u039e0, so that the classical algebra is represented as the multiplication operators in L2(\u039e0, \u00b5).

This kind of representation is the analog of the Schr\u00f6dinger representation: An explicit choice of Weyl operators satisfying the relations (7), initially without the claim that all good representations look like that. Indeed, it will be the next step to establish that claim, and hence the hybrid analog of von Neumann\u2019s result (Thm. 3 below).\nDefinition 1. Let \u039e = \u039e1 \u2295 \u039e0 be a hybrid phase space with antisymmetric form \u03c3 = \u03c31 \u2295 0. Then a standard representation is a representation of the Weyl relations in the Hilbert space H = H1 \u2297L2(\u039e0, \u00b5), where \u00b5 is some regular Borel measure on \u039e0, and H1 is the Hilbert space of the Schr\u00f6dinger representation W1 : \u039e1 \u2192 B(H1) for (\u039e1, \u03c31). The Weyl operators are given by\nW (\u03be1 \u2295 \u03be0) = W1(\u03be1) \u2297W0(\u03be0), (10)\nwhere W0(\u03be0) is the multiplication operator( W0(\u03be0)\u03d5 ) (x) = ei\u03be0\u00b7x\u03d5(x) (11)\nfor \u03d5 \u2208 L2(\u039e0, \u00b5) and x \u2208 \u039e0. A state on the CCR-algebra is called standard if it is given by a density operator on H in a standard representation.\nWe remark that the standard representation depends on \u00b5 only up to equivalence. That is, when two measures \u00b5 and \u00b5\u2032 have the same null sets, the Hilbert spaces L2(\u039e0, \u00b5) and L2(\u039e0, \u00b5\u2032) are the same by a unitary transformation that acts by multiplication (with \u221a d\u00b5/d\u00b5\u2032) and, in particular, intertwines the multiplication operators (11). We can, therefore, always choose \u00b5 to be a probability measure, typically the classical marginal of a state under consideration. Note that the translate of a standard state is again standard, but generally not in the same representation, unless \u00b5 is quasi-invariant (equivalent to its translates). This is the case just for the Lebesgue measure and will be discussed further in Sect. 2.7.\nThe von Neumann algebra generated by a standard representation is\nM\u00b5 = B(H1)\u2297L\u221e(\u039e0, \u00b5), (12)\nwhere \u2297 denotes the tensor product of von Neumann algebras. Indeed, since the W1(\u03be1) are irreducible on H1, they generate B(H1) as a von Neumann algebra, and similarly the Weyl multiplication operators generate the maximal abelian algebra of all multiplication operators Mf with f \u2208 L\u221e(\u039e0, \u00b5), which is isomorphic to L\u221e(\u039e0, \u00b5). Putting this together, and using the commutation theorem for tensor products [14, Thm. IV.5.9] gives (12). Note that this algebra still depends on \u00b5 because in L\u221e(\u039e0, \u00b5) functions, which only agree \u00b5-almost everywhere, are identified. By identifying A\u2297 f with the function x 7\u2192 f(x)A we can think of the elements of M\u00b5 as measurable B(H1)-valued functions on \u039e0. We will later strive to get rid of the \u00b5-dependence in the definition of observable algebras, as is motivated at the beginning of Sect. 3.\nStandard states are thus normal states on some M\u00b5, hence elements of the predual T 1(H1) \u2297 L1(\u039e0, \u00b5), where T 1(H1) denotes the trace class. They can hence be decomposed as\n\u03c9(A\u2297 f) = \u27e8\u03c9,A\u2297 f\u27e9 = \u222b \u00b5(dx)c(x) f(x) tr(\u03c1xA), (13)\nwhere c\u00b5 is the probability measure determining the classical marginal, i.e., the expectations of multiplication operators, and x 7\u2192 \u03c1x is a measurable family of density operators. The factor c(x) is introduced to allow that tr \u03c1x = 1 for all x. When we consider a particular state and its GNSrepresentation, we usually take \u00b5 directly as the classical marginal of that state, i.e., set c(x) \u2261 1. The required measurability conditions for the family of states \u03c1x are spelled out in [14, Sect. IV.7].\nThe definition of standard states brings in a dependence on \u00b5, so that it is not a priori clear that convex combinations of standard states are standard. However, the integral decomposition (13) makes clear that for a countable convex combination \u03c1 = \u2211 j \u03bbj\u03c1j we can take \u00b5 = \u2211 j \u03bbjcj\u00b5j , and, set hj to be the Radon\u2013Nikodym derivative of \u03bbjcj\u00b5j with respect to \u00b5. Note that 0 \u2264 hj(x) \u2264 1, and \u2211 j hj = 1. Then \u03c10 = 1 and \u03c1x = \u2211 j hj\u03c1x,j . In particular, a normal state in a direct sum of standard representations can be rewritten as a state using just a single summand, i.e., is also standard in the sense of the above definition.\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-04, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 12\nThis argument also shows that the von Neumann algebra approach to hybrids can be made to work on larger and larger sets of states: If needed, one can consider any countable (and thereby any norm separable) family of states as absolutely continuous with respect to a common reference measure. However, the set of measures on \u039e0 is not norm separable, so there is no single standard representation which can be used for all practical purposes. One could represent a single observable F by a net of functions F\u00b5 \u2208 B(H) \u2297 L\u221e(\u039e0, \u00b5), each defined up to \u00b5-a.e. equality. Then indices are ordered by absolute continuity \u00b5 \u226a \u03bd, i.e., \u03bd has fewer null sets than \u00b5, and in this case, F\u03bd is more sharply defined than F\u00b5. There is no natural limit to such nets because we cannot include all the uncountably many point measures. However, the notion of universally measurable sets and functions (see Sect. 3) does allow us to get rid of the Lebesgue completions.\nSince standard states thus form a convex set, it makes sense to ask for the extreme points, i.e., the pure states. These are readily characterized:\nLemma 2. A standard state \u03c9 on the CCR-algebra is extremal iff there is a point x \u2208 \u039e0 and a unit vector \u03d5 \u2208 H1 such that in the decomposition (13) \u00b5 = \u03b4x is a point measure and \u03c1x = |\u03d5\u27e9\u27e8\u03d5|.\nProof. Suppose that \u03c9 is extremal. Then let f \u2208 L\u221e(\u039e0) with \u03b5 < f < 1I \u2212 \u03b5 for some \u03b5 > 0. \u03c9 is then decomposed into the sum of two positive functionals\n\u03c9(X) = \u03c9(f) \u03c9(fX) \u03c9(f) + \u03c9(1 \u2212 f) \u03c9((1 \u2212 f)X) \u03c9(1 \u2212 f) . (14)\nThis is a convex combination of states, so by extremality, the two states have to be proportional, i.e., \u03c9(fX) = \u03bb\u03c9(X) for all X. This forces \u03bb = \u03c9(f), by putting X = 1I, and hence we conclude that f = \u03c9(f)1I almost everywhere with respect to \u00b5. Hence, \u00b5 is a point measure at some point x, say. The choice of \u03c1y for y \u0338= x is irrelevant because the whole complement of {x} has measure zero. The state \u03c1x is now given by a density operator, which clearly has to be extremal as well, so \u03c1x = |\u03d5\u27e9\u27e8\u03d5|.\nNote that a state \u03c9 may have no extremal components, i.e., no extreme points \u03c9\u2032 such that \u03c9 \u2265 \u03bb\u03c9\u2032 with \u03bb > 0. Indeed this will be the case whenever the measure \u00b5 has no atoms (points of non-zero measure). It is therefore not a priori clear in which sense standard states can be decomposed into extreme points. This will be clarified in Sect. 2.5, where it will be seen that the standard states are the state space of a certain C*-algebra, so the convex combinations of extreme points are dense in a suitable weak* topology."

It turns out that this characterizes standard representations. This is the main content of the following theorem, which is very close in its formulation and its proof to von Neumann\u2019s famous result [1].\nTheorem 3 (Hybrid Uniqueness Theorem). Every representation of the Weyl relations on a Hilbert space, for which the mapping \u03be 7\u2192 W (\u03be) is continuous in the strong operator topology, is unitarily equivalent to a direct sum of standard representations.\nIn the literature, it is traditional [52] to use a weaker continuity condition, which does not demand joint continuity of W in all 2n + s variables in \u03be \u2208 \u039e, but only along one-dimensional subspaces. This is the minimum required to get self-adjoint canonical operators and is usually called \u201cregularity\u201d [19, 21]. This weaker version avoids some of the topological subtleties of infinitedimensional \u039e. In the finite-dimensional case, there is no difference.\nProof. Consider a strongly continuous representation W on a Hilbert space H. For the most part, we will only need to use the representation \u03be1 7\u2192 W (\u03be1 \u2295 0) of the subgroup \u039e1. Following von Neumann, and even his notation up to a factor 2\u03c0, we introduce a Gaussian function a : \u039e1 \u2192 C and the operator\nA = \u222b d\u03be1 a(\u03be1)W (\u03be1 \u2295 0).

Because a is integrable, A is clearly a bounded operator. With von Neumann\u2019s choice, it is even a projection, and in the Schr\u00f6dinger representation, it is just the one-dimensional projection |\u2126\u27e9\u27e8\u2126| onto the harmonic oscillator ground state vector \u2126 \u2208 H1. Since algebraic relations between A and anything in CCR(\u039e1, \u03c31) are the same in any representation, it is hardly a surprise that we have\nAW (\u03be1 \u2295 0)A = \u27e8\u2126|W1(\u03be1)|\u2126\u27e9A =: \u03c7(\u03be1)A, (16)\nwhere W1 is the Schr\u00f6dinger representation and \u03c7(\u03be1) = exp(\u22121/4 \u03be21) is a Gaussian, the characteristic function of the oscillator ground state. But, of course, one can also show this (as von Neumann does) by explicit computation based on the Weyl relations.\nIt is a key part of von Neumann\u2019s argument that A cannot vanish for any continuous representation of \u039e1. Indeed, in such a representation also W (\u03b7 \u2295 0)AW (\u03b7 \u2295 0)\u2217 would vanish for all \u03b7, which is exactly of the form (15), with a kernel function a\u03b7(\u03be1) = exp(i\u03b7\u00b7\u03c3\u03be1)a(\u03be1). As a function of \u03b7, the integral of the modified (15) is thus the Fourier transform of an operator-valued L1-function, hence vanishes only if a does, which is false.\nConsider now the subspace H0 := AH and the set M of vectors of the form W (\u03be1 \u2295 0)\u03c80 for \u03be1 \u2208 \u039e1 and \u03c80 = A\u03c80 \u2208 H0. We claim that its linear span is dense. If \u03a8 \u2208 H were orthogonal to M , we would have that \u27e8AW (\u03be1 \u2295 0)\u03a8, A\u03c80\u27e9 = 0 for all \u03c80, so A would vanish on the cyclic sub-representation space of \u039e1 generated by \u03a8, contradicting von Neumann\u2019s result A \u0338= 0.\nWe define a function U : M \u2192 H1 \u2297 H0 by\nUW (\u03be1 \u2295 0)\u03c80 = W1(\u03be1)\u2126 \u2297 \u03c80. (17)\nScalar products between different vectors on M are preserved, so, in particular, it sends a linear combination representing the null vector again to a linear combination with vanishing norm. That is, it extends to a linear operator on the algebraic linear span of M . Clearly, this extension is isometric as well, so extends by continuity to H. Hence (17) defines an isometry U : H \u2192 H1 \u2297H0. It is also onto, because the vectors W1(\u03be1)\u2126 span H1. To summarize: U is unitary. Now since A commutes with W (0 \u2295 \u03b70) by virtue of the hybrid commutation relations, we can replace \u03c80 in (17) by W (0 \u2295 \u03b70)\u03c80, and upgrade that equation to a full intertwining relation on M :\nUW (\u03b71 \u2295 \u03b70)W (\u03be1 \u2295 0)\u03c80 = UW (\u03b71 \u2295 0)W (\u03be1 \u2295 0) ( W (0 \u2295 \u03b70)\u03c80 ) = W1(\u03b71)W1(\u03be1)\u2126 \u2297W (0 \u2295 \u03b70)\u03c80 = W1(\u03b71) \u2297W (0 \u2295 \u03be0)UW (\u03be1 \u2295 0)\u03c80. (18)\nHence W (\u03b71 \u2295 \u03b70) = U\u2217W1(\u03b71) \u2297W (0 \u2295 \u03b70)U . To complete the proof, it suffices to observe that the strongly continuous representation \u03be0 7\u2192 W (0 \u2295 \u03be0) of the group \u039e0 \u223c= Rs on H0 can be decomposed into a direct sum of cyclic ones, and the cyclic representations are of the form given in Def. 1. To see that this decomposition works together correctly with von Neumann\u2019s construction for \u039e1 was the main reason to include an abridged version of his argument."

            "text": "A state on the CCR-algebra is completely determined by its expectations on Weyl operators, hence by the function\n\u03c7(\u03be) = \u03c9(W (\u03be)), (19)\nwhich we call the characteristic function of \u03c9. Thus it is a natural question which functions exactly arise in this way. This demands unifying two well-known results: The purely classical case of this is known as Bochner\u2019s Theorem (sometimes: Bochner\u2013Khintchine Theorem [53]). Its quantum analog was apparently first formulated by Araki [18], with further relevant work by [17, 54, 55, 56, 22]. Its hybrid version (also in [21]) is the following.\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-04, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 14\nTheorem 4 (Hybrid Bochner Theorem). Let \u039e be a vector space with antisymmetric form \u03c3. Then a function \u03c7 : \u039e \u2192 C is the characteristic function of a standard state on CCR(\u039e, \u03c3) if and only if it is\n(1) continuous,\n(2) normalized, \u03c7(0) = 1, and\n(3) \u03c3-twisted positive definite, which means that, for any choice \u03be1, . . . , \u03beN , the N \u00d7N -matrix\nMk\u2113 = \u03c7(\u2212\u03bek + \u03be\u2113) e\u2212 i 2\u03c3(\u03bek, \u03be\u2113) (20)\nis positive semi-definite.\nProof. Just conditions (2) and (3) are equivalent to \u03c9 being a state on the CCR-algebra. Indeed, the positive definiteness condition is precisely equivalent to \u03c9(A\u2217A) \u2265 0, where A = \u2211 i ciW (\u03bei), and the Weyl relations are used. By the GNS-construction, every positive linear functional comes from a Hilbert space representation, and by definition of the CCR-algebra as the universal C*algebra of the Weyl relations, the state thus extends to the whole algebra.\nContinuity of \u03c7 for a standard \u03c9 is obvious because a standard representation is strongly continuous. Conversely, suppose that \u03c7 is continuous, and let \u2126 \u2208 H\u03c9 denote the cyclic vector of the GNS-representation of \u03c9. Then\n\u03be \u2192\u27e8\u03c0\u03c9 ( W (\u03b71) ) \u2126, \u03c0\u03c9 ( W (\u03be) ) \u03c0\u03c9 ( W (\u03b72) ) \u2126\u27e9 = \u27e8\u2126, \u03c0\u03c9 ( W (\u2212\u03b71)W (\u03be)W (\u03b72) ) \u2126\u27e9\n= exp ( \u2212 i2 ( \u03c3(\u03be, \u03b72) + \u03c3(\u2212\u03b71, \u03be + \u03b72) )) \u27e8\u2126, \u03c0\u03c9 ( W (\u03be \u2212 \u03b71 + \u03b72) ) \u2126\u27e9\n= \u03c7(\u03be \u2212 \u03b71 + \u03b72) exp ( \u2212 i2 ( \u03c3(\u03be, \u03b72) \u2212 \u03c3(\u03b71, \u03be) \u2212 \u03c3(\u03b71, \u03b72) )) (21)\nis continuous. Since the Weyl operators are bounded, this extends to the norm limits of linear combinations of \u03c0\u03c9 ( W (\u03b72) ) \u2126 which is, by definition, all of H\u03c9. Hence \u03c0\u03c9(W (\u00b7)) is weakly continuous, but for unitary operators, this is the same as strong continuity. Hence \u03c9 is normal in a strongly continuous representation.\nBy Thm. 3 this is a direct sum of standard representations, and by the argument preceding it, we conclude that \u03c9 itself is standard.\nTo see the power of the continuity condition, it may be useful to point out some rather wild states of the CCR-algebra. Indeed, this algebra is just the hybrid version of the almost periodic functions, in the precise sense of Prop. 21. Pure states on the almost periodic functions form the Bohr compactification of \u039e0 [57, Sect. 4.7], among which the points of \u039e0 (i.e., their point evaluations) are just a small part, and not even an open subset. This expresses the observation that almost periodic functions cannot distinguish a point from many others that are arbitrarily far away, so the finite and the infinite are intertwined more intimately than \u201cobservables\u201d would ever distinguish. An algebra whose states are better behaved may be more adequate for physics. Even for quantum field theory, where the CCR-algebra has been used extensively (with infinitedimensional \u039e), this need has been felt, and a recent proposal by Buchholz to consider not the exponentials of field operators but their resolvents [28, 58] (see Example 28), can be seen in this light. Certainly, this eliminates the extreme sensitivity to infinite values and, for example, allows the algebra to be invariant under typical quantum mechanical time evolutions [28, 58].\nThis suggests finding a C*-algebra whose states are just the \u201cgood\u201d ones described by Bochner\u2019s Theorem. This will be done in the next section."

            "text": "The CCR-algebra is constructed so that its representations exactly correspond to the representations of the Weyl relations. In this correspondence, the topology of \u039e plays no role at all. The way to set up a similar correspondence for just the continuous unitary representations is well known from the theory of locally compact groups: One goes to the convolution algebra over the group.\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-04, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 15\nIn fact, the term \u201cgroup algebra\u201d of a group is usually reserved for the C*-envelope of the convolution algebra L1(G), and not for the topology-free analog of the CCR-algebra [59, Ch. 13]. Von Neumann\u2019s proof uses the same idea by introducing the operator A as an integral. In this section, we follow this lead.\nThis will require a twisted version of the group algebra construction [60]. An alternative construction would be via the group C*-algebra of a related non-abelian group, a central extension [61, Ch. VII] of the additive group \u039e, called the Heisenberg group. The approach used below is a bit more direct in that it avoids the introduction of the central phase parameter, which is, in the end, integrated out anyhow. After we finished this work, we realized that the idea had already been followed through by Grundling [62, 63], with much the same motivation of getting a C*description of continuous representations, and even extended to more general groups, also beyond locally compact ones. To keep this paper self-contained, we nevertheless include our version.\nFor h \u2208 L1(\u039e, d\u03be) and any given measurable representation W of the Weyl relations we write the Bochner integral\nW [h] = \u222b d\u03be h(\u03be)W (\u03be). (22)\nThe bracket notation indicates that h 7\u2192 W [h] is closely related to the representation W . We can then describe the algebra of such operators directly in terms of operations on L1(\u039e, d\u03be). The multiplication rule and adjoints for such operators follows directly from the Weyl relations, namely W [h]W [g] = W [h\u2217\u03c3g] and W [h]\u2217 = W [h\u2217] with(\nh\u2217\u03c3g ) (\u03be) = \u222b d\u03b7 h(\u03be \u2212 \u03b7)g(\u03b7)e\u2212 i2 \u03be\u00b7\u03c3\u03b7, (23)\nh\u2217(\u03be) = h(\u2212\u03be). (24)\nThese operations turn L1(\u039e) into a Banach *-algebra, which we call the \u03c3-twisted convolution algebra of \u039e. Any set of elements h\u03b5 such that h\u03b5 \u2265 0, \u222b d\u03be h\u03b5(\u03be) = 1, and h\u03b5(\u03be) = 0 for \u03be outside a ball of radius \u03b5 around the origin is an approximate unit. As in the untwisted case, this follows from the strong continuity of translations on L1(\u039e).\nThe enveloping C*-algebra of the convolution algebra will be called the twisted group algebra of (\u039e, \u03c3) and denoted by C\u2217(\u039e, \u03c3). This is defined [59, Ch. 2, \u00a77] as the completion in the norm\n\u2225h\u2225 = sup \u03c0 \u2225\u03c0(h)\u2225 = sup \u03c9 \u03c9\n( h\u2217 \u2217\u03c3 h )1/2 , (25)\nwhere the supremum over \u03c0 runs over all *-representations of the algebra by Hilbert space operators, and \u03c9 runs over all positive linear functionals of norm \u2264 1. By slight abuse of notation, we denote the element in C\u2217(\u039e, \u03c3) associated with h \u2208 L1(\u039e) by the completion process again by h. This is justified by the observation that the canonical embedding L1(\u039e, \u03c3) \u21aa\u2192 C\u2217(\u039e, \u03c3) is injective.\nProposition 5. Let (\u039e, \u03c3) be a hybrid phase space. Then every state \u03c9 on C\u2217(\u039e, \u03c3) is given by a unique standard state \u03c9\u2032 on CCR(\u039e, \u03c3) and conversely, such that\n\u03c9 ( h ) = \u222b d\u03be h(\u03be)\u03c9\u2032 ( W (\u03be) ) . (26)\nThis proposition gives us the third way of looking at Weyl elements W (\u03be). At first, they were defined as explicit operators in any standard representation. Secondly, they appeared as the abstract generators of a CCR-algebra. These two views are equivalent by virtue of Bochner\u2019s Theorem, which identifies standard states with linear functionals \u03c9\u2032 on CCR(\u039e, \u03c3). The above proposition allows us to further introduce, for each \u03be, the linear functional \u03c9 7\u2192 \u03c9\u2032(W (\u03be)). This element of the bidual C\u2217(\u039e, \u03c3)\u2217\u2217 is yet another version of the Weyl element, which we will also denote by W (\u03be). It is clear that we cannot realize such an element in C\u2217(\u039e, \u03c3), since this algebra has no unit and hence contains no unitary elements. However, we can get close in the same sense the expression (22) can be close to W (\u03be), if h is concentrated near \u03be. The idea of the following proof is to do this limit in the GNS representation of \u03c9.\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-04, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 16\nProof. It is a general feature of the enveloping C*-algebra construction [59, Prop. 2.7.5] that the states \u03c9 on C\u2217(\u039e, \u03c3) are in bijective correspondence to the positive linear functionals \u03c9\u0303 on the convolution algebra with norm 1. Here the norm is taken as a linear functional on the Banach space L1(\u039e). That is, there is a function \u03c7 \u2208 L\u221e(\u039e) with \u2225\u03c7\u2225\u221e = 1 such that\n\u03c9\u0303(h) = \u222b d\u03be h(\u03be)\u03c7(\u03be) (27)\nThe main task of the proof is to show that the functions \u03c7 arising in this way are exactly the characteristic functions characterized by the Bochner Theorem, and in particular continuous. The uniqueness of the correspondence is clear from this equation since, on the one hand, it gives an explicit formula for \u03c9 (resp. \u03c9\u0303) in terms of \u03c9\u2032, and, on the other, two states \u03c9\u2032, \u03c9\u2032\u2032 satisfying it for the same \u03c9\u0303 would have to be equal as elements of L\u221e(\u039e), hence equal almost everywhere, and hence equal by continuity.\nWe begin by defining a version of the Weyl operators acting on L1(\u039e), namely\n(W\u0303 (\u03be)h)(\u03b7) := e\u2212 i2 \u03be\u00b7\u03c3\u03b7h(\u03b7 \u2212 \u03be). (28)\nIt is constructed so that h\u2217\u03c3g = \u222b d\u03be h(\u03be) W\u0303 (\u03be)g. (29)\nIntuitively, we can think of W\u0303 (\u03be) as the operator of convolution with \u03b4\u03be, the limit of probability densities concentrated near the point \u03be. While this is not an element of the algebra, its operation is defined analogously to the approximate unit \u03b40. It is easy to check that the operators W\u0303 (\u03be) satisfy the Weyl multiplication rules (7). However, unitarity does not make sense since L1(\u039e) is not a Hilbert space. The crucial observation is that \u03be 7\u2192 W\u0303 (\u03be)g is continuous in the norm of L1(\u039e). Indeed, it is a product of a translation and a multiplication operator, which are both strongly continuous on L1.\nConsider now a positive linear functional \u03c9\u0303 on L1(\u039e). Its GNS representation space H\u0303 is the unique Hilbert space generated by vectors v(h), h \u2208 L1(\u039e), with the scalar product \u27e8v(h)|v(k)\u27e9 = \u03c9\u0303(h\u2217 \u2217\u03c3 k). On these, the representation W : L1(\u039e) \u2192 B(H\u0303) acts by left multiplication in the convolution algebra, i.e., according to the formula\nW [h]v(g) = v ( h \u2217\u03c3 g ) . (30)\nAccording to [14, I.9.14] the GNS space has a cyclic vector \u2126 and a representation W : L1(\u039e) \u2192 B(H\u0303) such that v(h) = W [h]\u2126, and \u27e8\u2126,W [h]\u2126\u27e9 = \u03c9\u0303(h). Indeed, one has \u2126 = lim\u03b5\u21920 v(h\u03b5), where h\u03b5 is a bounded approximate unit.\nOur next aim is to show that W arises exactly as in (22) from the integration of a representation W of the Weyl relations (recall that the two functions will be typographically distinguished by their argument brackets). The obvious candidate for the Weyl operators W (\u00b7) are the operators W\u0303 (\u03be) from (28), represented on H\u0303 in GNS style. That is, in analogy to (30) we set\nW (\u03be)v(g) = v ( W\u0303 (\u03be)g ) . (31)\nThen it is elementary to check that W (\u03be) is unitary, and these operators satisfy the Weyl relations. Moreover, the L1-norm continuity of \u03be 7\u2192 W\u0303 (\u03be)g established earlier implies that \u03be 7\u2192 W (\u03be) is continuous in the strong operator topology. Finally, (29) implies\nW [h]v(g) = v ( h \u2217\u03c3 g ) = \u222b d\u03be h(\u03be)v ( W\u0303 (\u03be)g ) = \u222b d\u03be h(\u03be)W (\u03be)v ( g ) ,\ni.e., the GNS-representation W [h] is related to the continuous representation W by (22). In particular \u03c9\u0303(h) = \u222b d\u03be h(\u03be)\u27e8\u2126,W (\u03be)\u2126\u27e9,\nso (27) holds with \u03c7(\u03be) = \u27e8\u2126,W (\u03be)\u2126\u27e9, which is clearly a normalized twisted positive definite function, and continuous because W (\u03be) is strongly continuous.\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-04, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 17\nConversely, given a state on the CCR-algebra, we can define its characteristic function \u03c7(\u03be) = \u03c9\u2032(W (\u03be)). In general, that might fail to be even measurable, so the formula (27) might make no sense. For standard states, however, \u03c7 is continuous, and the integral is well defined.\nWe now determine the algebras C\u2217(\u039e, \u03c3) concretely. It turns out that this is best done by splitting into a purely classical and a purely quantum part.\nProposition 6. Let (\u039e, \u03c3) be a hybrid phase space, split as \u039e = \u039e1 \u2295 \u039e0 with \u03c3 = \u03c31 \u2295 0. Then\nC\u2217(\u039e, \u03c3) = C\u2217(\u039e1, \u03c31) \u2297 C\u2217(\u039e0, 0) \u223c= K(H1) \u2297 C0(\u039e0), (32)\nwhere K(H1) denotes the compact operators on the representation space H1 of the irreducible quantum system (\u039e1, \u03c31), and C0(\u039e0) denotes the continuous functions on \u039e0 vanishing at infinity.\nProof. We first observe that for the underlying L1-spaces, the direct sum naturally coincides with the projective product, which is predual to the tensor product of von Neumann algebras. That is\nL1(\u039e1 \u2295 \u039e0) = L1(\u039e1) \u2297 L1(\u039e0). (33)\nIndeed, the tensor products f \u2297 g on the right hand side can be identified with the product functions fg(\u03be0 \u2295 \u03be1) = f(\u03be1)g(\u03be0), and this embedding is clearly isometric on step functions. Since the measurable structure of \u039e1 \u2295 \u039e0, which is \u039e1 \u00d7 \u039e0 as a set, is defined as generated by rectangles, the product functions span a dense subspace of L1(\u039e1 \u2295 \u039e0). It is elementary to verify that the isomorphism (33) is also consistent with the definitions of adjoint operation and convolution product.\nThe completion in the construction of the enveloping C*-algebra also works out: As one side of the tensor product is abelian, and the maximal and the minimal tensor product coincide, the tensor product is uniquely determined, as is the algebra in tensor product form.\nIn the second step, we need to show the claimed isomorphisms: Beginning with the classical case, L1(\u039e0) is the convolution algebra of \u039e0 \u223c= Rs. Its irreducible representations are described by the Gelfand isomorphism for abelian Banach algebras: In this case they are given by the point evaluations of the Fourier transform. Hence the C*-norm of the enveloping algebra, \u2225h\u2225 = sup\u03c0 \u2225\u03c0[h]\u2225 is equal to the supremum norm of the Fourier transform of h. Now by the Riemann\u2013 Lebegue Lemma, the Fourier transforms of L1-functions are continuous and go to zero at infinity. On the other hand, by the Stone\u2013Weierstra\u00df Theorem, these Fourier transforms separate points and are hence uniformly dense. Hence C\u2217(\u039e0) = C0(\u039e0).\nFor quantum systems, note that every continuous representation of the Weyl relations is isomorphic to the Schr\u00f6dinger representation on H1 by von Neumann\u2019s Uniqueness Theorem. Hence we only need to show that in that representation, the operators of the form W [h] with h \u2208 L1(\u039e1) are compact, and these operators form a dense subalgebra of K(H1). This follows immediately by the correspondence theory [27, Cor. 5.1.(4)].\nAn alternative approach using better known facts goes via first showing that operators h 7\u2192 W [h] are not only continuous from L1 to B(H1) but also an isometry for the 2-norms, i.e. \u2225W [h]\u22252 = \u2225h\u22252, for h \u2208 L1(\u039e1) \u2229 L2(\u039e1) \u2261 A, and the Schatten 2-norm (Schmidt norm) on the operator side. Continuous extension via these 2-norms is even unitary. Hence W [A] consists of Hilbert\u2013Schmidt operators, which are compact, and by taking limits in 2-norm, we find that W [A] is operator norm dense in the Hilbert\u2013Schmidt class, hence in K(H1).\nWe note that as a consequence of this characterization, we find that there are many extremal standard states since the state space of C\u2217(\u039e, \u03c3) is the weak*-closed convex hull of its extreme points, by the Banach\u2013Alaoglu and Krein\u2013Milman Theorems. Of course, these were already identified in Lem. 2."

Indeed, an arbitrarily small shift applied to a point measure moves it as far away as possible in the natural norm on states. Since translations are strongly continuous on L1(Rn, dx), this is different for probability measures with absolutely continuous densities. We can use this to single out one particular standard representation, namely that using the Lebesgue measure for \u00b5.\nProposition 7. Let \u03c9 \u2208 C\u2217(\u039e, \u03c3)\u2217 be a state with characteristic function \u03c7, and let \u00b5 be its marginal probability measure on \u039e0.

As a partial converse, if \u03c7 \u2208 Lp(\u039e, d\u03be) for some p \u2208 [1, 2] then the above conditions hold.\nProof. (1)\u21d2(2): (2) only depends on the restriction of \u03c9 to the classical algebra. So this is a purely classical observation, which is valid for any locally compact group. Let \u03b1\u2217x, x \u2208 Rn denote the action of translations on measures over Rn. Then (1) says limx\u21920 \u2225\u00b5\u2212\u03b1\u2217x(\u00b5)\u2225 = 0, where the norm is the dual norm of the supremum norm on C0(Rn), i.e., the total variation norm on measures. For any \u03b5 > 0, there is thus a neighbourhood U\u03b5 \u220b 0 such that \u2225\u00b5\u2212 \u03b1\u2217x(\u00b5)\u2225 \u2264 \u03b5 for x \u2208 U\u03b5. We pick a positive measurable function h \u2208 L1(Rn, dx) with integral 1 and support in U\u03b5, and set\n\u03b1\u2217h(\u00b5) = \u222b dx h(x)\u03b1\u2217x(\u00b5), (37)\nwhich is to be read as a weak* integral.

On the other hand, \u03b1\u2217h(\u00b5) is absolutely continuous, because (37) is the convolution of the two measures \u00b5 and h dx. Explicitly, for an arbitrary f \u2208 C0(Rn), we get(\n\u03b1\u2217h\u00b5 ) (f) = \u222b dx h(x) \u222b \u00b5(dy) f(y \u2212 x) = \u222b \u00b5(dy) \u222b dx h(y \u2212 x)f(x), (38)\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-04, click title to verify.

We also recall that the variation norm of absolutely continuous measures is just the L1 norm of their densities. Now since \u03b1\u2217h(\u00b5) converges in norm to \u00b5 as \u03b5 \u2192 0, the corresponding densities h\u0303 form a Cauchy net in L1(Rn, dx). Its limit h\u03030 must be in L1 by completeness of L1. This is then a density for \u00b5, so \u00b5 is itself absolutely continuous.\n(2)\u21d2(3): Consider the standard representation for \u00b5 in the Hilbert space H1 \u2297 L2(\u039e0, \u00b5). We can consider this as a subspace of H1 \u2297 L2(\u039e0, dx) with the Lebesgue measure. By Def. 1 \u03c9, as a state on the CCR-algebra, can be represented as a normal state on this space. Apart from the canonical position operators in L2(\u039e0, dx), which are already part of the hybrid setup, we can take the shift generators in this tensor factor as further canonical momentum operators. The full set of canonical operators is then clearly irreducible, so the extended system is purely quantum.\n(3)\u21d2(1): The Weyl translations in a standard representation are strongly continuous, which implies that the action \u03b1\u2217\u03be(\u03c1) = W (\u03c3\u03be)\u2217\u03c1W (\u03c3\u03be) is norm continuous for every \u03c1 \u2208 T (H) so we can just restrict the continuity condition for the extended system to those translations \u03b7 which make sense in the original hybrid.\nThe final remark in the proposition is clear in one direction from the Riemann\u2013Lebesgue Lemma and its quantum version [27]. In the converse direction, it follows that the Fourier transform of \u03c7 is the density with respect to the Lebesgue measure, which is then even continuous and goes to zero.\n2.8 Lp-spaces If one is not interested in pure states, a good setting for hybrids is to restrict consideration to the norm continuous states characterized by Prop. 7. This leads to a purely von Neumann algebraic picture: Since all probability measures \u00b5 are then absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure dx, we can represent all states in H = H1 \u2297 L2(\u039e0, dx), which leads to the spaces\nL1(\u039e, \u03c3) := T 1(H1) \u2297 L1(\u039e0, dx) and L\u221e(\u039e, \u03c3) := B(H1)\u2297L\u221e(\u039e0, dx). (39)\nHere the tensor product on the right uses the 1-norm completion, and T p denotes the Schatten classes for 1 \u2264 p < \u221e, so T 1 is the trace class. T \u221e would be ambiguous, meaning either all bounded operators B(H) or just the compact operators K(H1), so we prefer to specify explicitly. The tensor product on the right is then the von Neumann algebra version, constructed as the completion of the product operators in the weak (or similar) operator topology. This choice was adopted, for example, in [35, 36, 64], see Sect. 1.3. Note that the von Neumann algebra L\u221e(\u039e, \u03c3) is not a subalgebra of U(\u039e, \u03c3) but a quotient, because the (L1, L\u221e)-duality is defined by selecting a subspace of states (cf. Fig. 3). In fact, it does not make sense to evaluate an element F \u2208 L\u221e(\u039e, \u03c3) on a pure state because functions differing at one point, e.g., the point x \u2208 \u039e0 on which the pure state lives, are identified.\nThe combined Schatten/Lebesgue spaces Lp(\u039e, \u03c3) can be obtained by a purely von Neumann algebraic construction using the semifinite trace t\u0302r(f \u2297 A) = \u222b dx f(x) trA on L\u221e(\u039e, \u03c3). Then Lp(\u039e, \u03c3) comes out as the p-norm completion of the elements F \u2208 L\u221e so that \u2225F\u2225pp := t\u0302r|F |p < \u221e. These spaces are also connected by interpolation [65].

            "text": "This subsection harks back to the classic paper [66] by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen. Think of a standard quantum system with phase space \u039e and non-degenerate \u03c3. We then consider an \u201copposite\u201d system over (\u039e,\u2212\u03c3), which can be realized in the same Hilbert space, and the Weyl system W with W (a, b) = W (\u2212a, b). That is in the position representation (6) we can write W (\u03be) = \u0398W (\u03be)\u0398 with \u0398 the complex conjugation in that representation. Then the operators W\u0303 (\u03be) = W (\u03be) \u2297 W (\u03be) commute, and so the characteristic function \u03c72(\u03be) = \u03c92(W\u0303 (\u03be)) is not subject to uncertainty constraints. That is, it may correspond to a probability distribution sharply concentrated at the origin. In the EPR paper the state is to have sharp distribution for the canonical operators Q1 \u2212 Q2 and P1 + P2. What they actually write down is an unnormalizable wave function, but the intention is clearly to have \u201cpretty sharp\u201d distributions for these operators, of course, at the expense of their canonical conjugates P1 \u2212 P2 and Q1 +Q2. The limit they suggest is really not necessary for their argument. In fact, they are perfectly aware that a maximally entangled state can be written out equivalently in complementary bases, so their argument would go through literally on finite phase spaces with sharp distributions, just as in the version for spins that was later championed by Bohm [67, Sect.22.17].\nTaking here the limit and to go to really sharp distributions is an interesting exercise in singular states [68], which may serve here to highlight the importance of the continuity condition in Bochner\u2019s Theorem. First of all, by weak* compactness the limit of states with sharper and sharper distributions for Q1 \u2212Q2 and P1 +P2 exists (at least along a subnet) as a state on B(H\u2297H). Since we have not specified any details of the sequence there are very many states that might arise as a weak* cluster point of such a sequence, and since we are implicitly invoking the axiom of choice, there is no way to give a finite specification ensuring convergence on all observables. However, for some simple operators, like the Weyl operators themselves, the scant characterization is sufficient to determine the limit. Thus we get a \u201ccharacteristic function\u201d, namely\n\u27e8\u03c9EPR,W (\u03be) \u2297W (\u03b7)\u27e9 = {\n1 \u03be = \u03b7 0 otherwise. (43)\nThis is clearly discontinuous, and so corresponds to no density operator. It is also insufficient to specify the state on observables not expressed as linear combinations of Weyl operators. But some things can be read off easily. For example, the marginal for the first party (\u03b7 = 0 in the above) will have the \u201ccharacteristic function\u201d which vanishes everywhere except for \u03be = 0. This means that the probability for finding a value in some finite interval [a, b] for the spectral resolution of any canonical operator is zero. Although the joint probability for Q1 and Q2 may be in some sense concentrated on x1 = x2, the values themselves are infinite with probability one, and can only be specified as infinite points in some (non-constructive) compactification of position space. This is hardly what the authors intended, so it is much more useful to stick with \u201cpretty sharp\u201d distributions.\nThis is also a practical issue for quantum optics, where squeezed states play an important role. The following is the prototype:\nExample 8. The two-mode squeezed state \u25b7 Consider a standard Gaussian product state of the doubled system, i.e. \u03c70(\u03be1\u2295\u03be2) = exp \u221212 ( p21+\np22 +q21 +q22 ) .

When \u03b7 = \u03be, this converges pointwise to (43), but since the limit is not continuous, L\u00e9vy\u2019s convergence theorem (Prop. 16) does not apply. \u25c1\nTaking just the case \u03be = \u03b7, we see that (44) converges pointwise to 1 as \u03bb \u2192 \u221e. This property will be useful in the proof of Cor. 25, as well as in the analysis of teleportation (Sect. 5.8). We therefore generalize it to arbitrary hybrids:\nLemma 9. For any hybrid system (\u039e, \u03c3) there is a family of states \u03c9\u03b5 for the system (\u039e \u2295 \u039e, \u03c3 \u2295 (\u2212\u03c3)) such that\nlim \u03b5\u21920\n\u27e8\u03c9\u03b5,W (\u03be) \u2297W (\u03be)\u27e9 \u2265 exp (\u2212\u03b5 2 \u03be\u00b7A\u03be )\nfor all \u03be \u2208 \u039e, (45)\nwhere A is the covariance matrix of a quantum state on (\u039e, \u03c3), i.e., A+ i\u03c3 \u2265 0. In particular, the left hand side goes to 1 as \u03b5 \u2192 0.\nProof. When (\u039e, \u03c3) is a direct sum of other spaces, we can reduce the proof to each summand by taking tensor products. We need only two types of summands: single degree of freedom quantum systems for which Example 8 provides just the required states with \u03b5 = e\u22122\u03bb, \u03bb \u2192 \u221e, and one dimensional classical systems. For these we can take any probability measure on the doubled system, which is concentrated on the diagonal. This will satisfy the condition even with \u03b5 = 0."

            "text": "The aim of this section is to complement the description of hybrid states by spaces of observables. In contrast to the states there are different options to consider. The two basic possibilities are the following:\nThe \u00b5-dependent setting Any standard representation in the sense of Def. 1 gives us a natural observable algebra, the von Neumann algebra B(H1)\u2297L\u221e(\u039e0, \u00b5), in which observables are B(H1)-valued functions on \u039e0. The catch is that this depends on \u00b5, and any choice of \u00b5 excludes some states. For example, with the Lebesgue measure for \u00b5, we exclude all pure states.\nThe \u00b5-free setting This is the point of view based on the C*-algebra A = C\u2217(\u039e, \u03c3), allowing all states of A. The maximal space of observables, for which these states provide probability distributions, is, by definition, the bidual A\u2217\u2217. This, however, is a rather wild non-separable object, with many elements that owe their existence to the axiom of choice, and are impossible to describe explicitly. So instead we will be interested in intermediate algebras M with A \u2282 M \u2282 A\u2217\u2217.\nWe approach this choice from a very pragmatic point of view. The channels we want to study in Sect. 4 have a very simple description not involving the measure \u00b5. Our aim will be to establish also a straightforward action on observables, i.e., the corresponding Heisenberg picture. This makes the \u00b5-dependent approach cumbersome, since it requires the specification of a measure both for the input and the output system, and conditions on the channel to ensure that these choices match up for the given channel. Since the measure is characteristic of only classical part of the hybrid, and classical and quantum information can be reshuffled arbitrarily by a quasifree channel, such conditions have to be stated carefully, and we would like to avoid this in the general theory.\nIn the \u00b5-free approach one has to choose appropriate algebras M, but we will be looking for choices with an automatic Heisenberg picture for all quasifree channels without the need to check any further conditions. For that we will describe the candidate algebras M by intrinsic properties in terms of A, which make sense for arbitrary C*-algebras, hybrid or not. Roughly speaking, M will describe a degree of regularity for observables, which is preserved by all quasifree channels. That is, the adjoint of a channel T : A\u2217in \u2192 A\u2217out defined in the Schr\u00f6dinger picture, which by\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-04, click title to verify.

This is equivalent [69] to the continuity of T in the weak topologies \u03c3(A\u2217,M) induced by these spaces. Thus rather than a weakness, the multitude of spaces M is a strength: Without the need to check for any special properties of the given channel it establishes a variety of continuity properties (see Prop. 26).\nThe appropriate spaces M will be introduced in the following Sect. 3.1, without taking the hybrid structure of A into account. This section is based on the seminal early work of a functional analyst doing analysis, namely Gert Pedersen, whose slogan for his textbook \u201cAnalysis NOW\u201d [70] also stands for \u201cAnalysis based on Norms, Operators, and Weak topologies\u201d. In spite of its relative abstractness, this approach leads painlessly to just the Heisenberg picture characterizations we wanted to see. The following Sect. 3.2 specializes these notions to the hybrid structure."

            "text": "The constructions in this section are inspired by the commutative case [71], but have been generalized to arbitrary C*-algebras in [72, 73, 74] (see also [14, III, \u00a76] for a textbook version). The commutation relations are not needed for this so that we will consider first a general C*-algebra A, typically without a unit, and only in the next section specialize to hybrids, i.e., A = C0(X,K(H)). The standard states are then elements of the dual, and we are interested in well-behaved subalgebras of the bidual. A special role will be played by the pure states of A.\nFor the various dualities between spaces of states and spaces of observables, we use the following notation: \u27e8\u03c9,A\u27e9 will be the expectation value of the observable A in the state \u03c9, where \u03c9 \u2208 A\u2217 and A \u2208 A or A \u2208 A\u2217\u2217, and this is extended to the whole linear spaces. We thereby identify A with a subspace of A\u2217\u2217. By definition, the state space of A is the set of positive linear functionals of norm 1. Even wenn A has no unit, this still can be written as \u27e8\u03c9, 1I\u27e9 = 1, but then 1I \u2208 A\u2217\u2217. The weak*-topology on A\u2217 is the topology making all functionals \u03c9 7\u2192 \u27e8\u03c9,A\u27e9 with A \u2208 A continuous, whereas the weak-topology is similarly defined with A \u2208 A\u2217\u2217. By the Banach\u2013Alaoglu Theorem, the \u201cquasi-state space\u201d Q = {\u03c9 \u2208 A\u2217|\u03c9 \u2265 0, \u2225\u03c9\u2225 \u2264 1} is weak*-compact, so by the Krein\u2013Milman Theorem, Q is the closed convex hull of its extreme points. Thus there are many extremal, that is \u201cpure\u201d states, and one additional extreme point 0 \u2208 Q: When 1I /\u2208 A the normalization functional is not weak*-continuous, so the state space is not weak*-compact, and there will be sequences of pure states converging to 0.\nThe second dual A\u2217\u2217 can be identified with its \u201cenveloping von Neumann algebra\u201d, which is the von Neumann algebra generated by A in its universal representation [14, Ch. III.6]. This is simply the direct sum of all GNS-representations of A. Its center is the natural arena for the representation theory of A in the following sense: For every representation \u03c0 : A \u2192 B(H\u03c0) there is a central projection z\u03c0 \u2208 A\u2217\u2217 such that \u03c0(A)\u2032\u2032 \u223c= z\u03c0A\u2217\u2217 as a von Neumann algebra. Representations \u03c01, \u03c02 which can be connected to each other by an isomorphism from \u03c01(A)\u2032\u2032 to \u03c01(A)\u2032\u2032 are called quasi-equivalent. So the central projections of A\u2217\u2217 classify representations up to quasi-equivalence [14, Thm. III.2.12].\nConsider now a pure state \u03c9 \u2208 A\u2217. Its GNS-representation is irreducible, and hence the corresponding central projection z\u03c0 is minimal, meaning that there is no projection p in the center of A\u2217\u2217, other than 0 and z\u03c0, such that 0 \u2264 p \u2264 z\u03c0. Minimal projections are also called atoms of the projection lattice. Then the minimal projections of A\u2217\u2217 correspond exactly to the pure states on A. We record this simple observation as a statement for arbitrary von Neumann algebras (cp. [75]).\nLemma 10. Let M be a von Neumann algebra. Then there is a one-to-one correspondence between minimal projections p \u2208 M and extremal normal states \u03c9 \u2208 M\u2217, given by\npxp = \u03c9(x)p, for all x \u2208 M. (46)\nProof. For any projection p we consider the von Neumann subalgebra M\u0303 = pMp. The crucial issue is whether this algebra is one-dimensional. When that is the case, we must have pxp = \u03c9(x)p, for some functional \u03c9, which is necessarily a normal state. We will proceed by showing the implications \u201cp minimal\u201d \u21d4\u201cdim M\u0303 = 1\u201d\u21d2 \u201c\u03c9 extremal\u201d\u21d2 \u201cthe support projection of \u03c9 satisfies dim M\u0303 = 1\u201d.\nIndeed, p is minimal iff, for any projection q, 0 \u2264 q \u2264 p implies q = 0 or q = p. This is equivalent to 0 and p being the only projections in M\u0303, i.e., to dim M\u0303 = 1.\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-04, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 23\nIn this case consider the state \u03c9. Then from \u03c9 = \u03bb\u03c91 + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)\u03c92 we conclude \u03c91 \u2264 \u03bb\u22121\u03c9, hence |\u27e8\u03c91, x(1 \u2212 p)\u27e9|2 \u2264 \u27e8\u03c91, (1 \u2212 p)x\u2217x(1 \u2212 p)\u27e9 \u2264 \u03bb\u22121\u27e8\u03c9, (1 \u2212 p)x\u2217x(1 \u2212 p)\u27e9 = 0. (47) But then \u27e8\u03c91, x\u27e9 = \u27e8\u03c91, pxp\u27e9 = \u27e8\u03c9, x\u27e9\u27e8\u03c91, p\u27e9 and \u27e8\u03c91, p\u27e9 = 1 by choosing x = 1I in this equation. Hence \u03c91 = \u03c9, so \u03c9 is extremal.\nNow let \u03c9 be extremal and normal, and let p be its support, i.e., the smallest projection such that \u27e8\u03c9, p\u27e9 = 1. Then \u03c9 restricted to M\u0303 is also pure and, in addition, faithful, i.e., x \u2208 M\u0303 with \u27e8\u03c9, x\u2217x\u27e9 = 0 implies x = 0. Indeed, the eigenprojection q \u2208 M\u0303 of x\u2217x for the spectral set {0} must then satisfy \u27e8\u03c9, q\u27e9 = 1. Hence on the one hand q \u2264 p, because q \u2208 pMp, and q \u2265 p by minimality of the support projection p. Therefore x\u2217x = 0.\nSo consider the GNS-representation \u03c0\u03c9 of a faithful normal pure state. Faithfulness implies that the representation is injective, and general representation theorems [76, 1.16.2] imply that the image \u03c0\u03c9(M\u0303) is a von Neumann algebra. By purity, \u03c0\u03c9(M\u0303) is irreducible, so \u03c0\u03c9(M\u0303) = B(H\u03c9). On the other hand, \u03c9 is given by a vector \u2126 \u2208 H\u03c9. So, unless dim H\u03c9 = 1, there is a vector orthogonal to it and hence a non-zero element x with \u03c0\u03c9(x)\u2126 = 0, and hence \u27e8\u03c9, x\u2217x\u27e9 = 0, contradicting faithfulness. Hence dim H\u03c9 = 1, and dim M\u0303 = 1.\nFor many von Neumann algebras, this is a statement about the empty set, namely when M is of type II or III, or L\u221e(X,\u00b5) when there are no points with positive \u00b5-measure. However, for a second dual, there are many extreme points. Their central cover is the smallest central projection za, so that p \u2264 za for all minimal projections, and zaA\u2217\u2217 is isomorphic to the von Neumann algebra generated by the uncountable direct sum of all normal pure state representations, called the atomic representation of A\u2217\u2217. This is the part that will be useful for a function representation.\nIndeed, consider for a moment the classical case A = C0(X). Then there is a simple way to associate with an element A \u2208 A\u2217\u2217 a function A\u030c on X, namely to evaluate A in the pure state \u03b4x, the point measure at x \u2208 X, setting A\u030c(x) = \u03b4x(A). However, when A has support in the complement of the atomic subspace (also called the diffuse subspace) we get \u03b4x(A)p = pAp = 0, where p is the projection associated with \u03b4x via (46). Hence A\u030c = 0, so the function A\u030c has nothing to say about A.\nNevertheless, for suitable subalgebras of A\u2217\u2217 the atomic representation, and hence the function representation A\u030c contains full information. The idea of [72] is to use monotone limits to construct useful algebras with this property. Since these constructions work in the same way in arbitrary C*-algebras, they also serve to provide a Heisenberg picture for general dual channels.\nIn A\u2217\u2217 bounded, increasing nets are automatically weak*-convergent, and if this algebra is represented on a Hilbert space, the limits exist in the strong operator topology. This makes most sense in the hermitian part A\u2217\u2217h of A\u2217\u2217. For any subset M \u2282 A\u2217\u2217h we denote by M\u2191 the set of limit points of such nets from M . Similarly, M\u2193 = \u2212(\u2212M)\u2191 represents the limits of decreasing nets from M .\nDefinition 11. Let A be a C*-algebra. Then\n\u2022 The multiplier algebra of A, denoted by M(A), is the set of elements m \u2208 A\u2217\u2217 such that, for all a \u2208 A, ma \u2208 A and am \u2208 A.\n\u2022 A\u2191 := (Ah +R1I)\u2191 is called the lower semicontinuous cone of A\u2217\u2217h . The upper semicontinuous cone is A\u2193 = (Ah + R1I)\u2193\n\u2022 An element a \u2208 A\u2217\u2217h is called universally measurable if, for every state \u03c9 \u2208 A\u2217, and every \u03b5 > 0, there are x \u2208 A\u2191, y \u2208 A\u2193 such that x \u2264 a \u2264 y, and \u03c9(y \u2212 x) < \u03b5. The real vector space of universally measurable elements is denoted by U(A).\nWe remark that there are some subtle distinctions in defining the semicontinuous cone, depending on whether the unit is adjoined first (as above) and on whether a norm closure of the cone is taken. These are discussed carefully in [73, 74]. The main observations for us are that A\u2191 \u222a A\u2193 = M(A)h [14, Thm. III.6.24], and that the atomic representation is isometric on U(A) [14, Thm. III.6.37].\nIn the classical case, A = C0(X) with X locally compact, the lower semicontinuous cone consists just of the bounded lower semicontinuous functions f in the sense of point set topology (lower\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-04, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 24\nlevel sets {x|f(x) \u2264 a} are closed). The multipliers are M(A) = Cb(X), all bounded continuous functions. For the universally measurable functions, note that, for a fixed measure \u00b5 \u2208 C0(X)\u2217, by definition, all bounded Borel measurable functions can be integrated. However, one usually completes the Borel algebra by including all \u00b5-null sets. The completion can be understood by adding all sets which can be approximated from above and below by Borel measurable sets, whose \u00b5-volume differs by arbitrarily little. The completion construction depends on \u00b5, but some sets will be added for all \u00b5, and these are called universally measurable [77]. The functions that are measurable for the completed \u03c3-algebra are called \u00b5-measurable, and their classes up to \u00b5-a.e. equality form L\u221e(X,\u00b5). The approximation from above and below for defining \u00b5-measurable sets has its counterpart for functions in the definition given above, with fixed \u00b5 = \u03c9. Hence the universally measurable functions are those that are \u00b5-measurable for all \u00b5.\nFor these subsets of observables, there is an automatic Heisenberg picture for channels defined on states:\nLemma 12. Let A and B be C*-algebras, and T : A\u2217 \u2192 B\u2217 a linear map taking states to states. Let T \u2217 : B\u2217\u2217 \u2192 A\u2217\u2217. Then the inclusions T \u2217M(B) \u2282 M(A), T \u2217B\u2191 \u2282 A\u2191 and T \u2217U(B) \u2282 U(A) hold.\nProof. Dual channels T \u2217 : B\u2217\u2217 \u2192 A\u2217\u2217 preserve positivity and normalization. The latter condition can be written as T \u22171I = 1I. They map increasing nets to increasing nets and are continuous for the respective limits. Hence T \u2217B\u2191 \u2282 A\u2191. Then the characterization of multipliers as both upper and lower continuous shows T \u2217M(B) \u2282 M(A). This is actually not so obvious just from the definition of multipliers.\nFor the universally measurable class we proceed directly: Fix b \u2208 U(B) and \u03b5 > 0. Then by definition we can find bi \u2208 Bi for i =\u2191, \u2193 such that b\u2191 \u2264 b \u2264 b\u2193 and (T\u03c9)(b\u2193 \u2212 b\u2191) \u2264 \u03b5 dualizing T in the last inequality and applying T \u2217 to the inequality for b gives the required upper and lower bounds T \u2217bi for T \u2217b.\nWe note that such inclusions are always equivalent to a continuity condition for T . If we chose subspaces A\u0303 \u2282 A\u2217\u2217 and B\u0303 \u2282 B\u2217\u2217, the inclusion T \u2217(B\u0303) \u2282 A\u0303 is equivalent [69, IV.2.1] to the continuity with respect to the weak topologies \u03c3(A\u2217, A\u0303) and \u03c3(B\u2217, A\u0303), which are defined to make just those linear functionals A \u2192 C continuous, which are given by elements of A\u0303 (and similarly for B)."

            "heading": "3.2 Hybrid observables as functions",
            "text": "Let us now apply the ideas of the previous section to hybrids. The symplectic form and the group theoretical structure of the phase space does not play a key role here, so we are looking at a slightly more general case, where the underlying C*-algebra is A = K \u2297 C0(X), where K denotes the compact operators on a separable Hilbert space H, and X is a locally compact metrizable space generalizing \u039e0. As a above we can identify A with C0(X,K), the functions X 7\u2192 K which are continuous in norm and vanishing in norm at infinity. Under this identification A = f \u2297 K becomes the function A(x) = f(x)K. In [74, end of intro.], this algebra is actually suggested as the intuition-building model case for the theory we outlined in the previous section.\nGoing to the first dual A\u2217, we find the states, and their disintegration as in (13): We can write each state \u03c9 as \u03c9(f \u2297A) =: \u27e8\u03c9, f \u2297A\u27e9 = \u222b \u00b5(dx)m(x) f(x) tr(\u03c1xA), (48)\nwhere \u00b5 is a (not necessarily finite) measure on X, m \u2208 L1(X,\u00b5) is a probability density, so that \u00b5m is an arbitrary probability measure. This splitting of the classical marginal merely emphasized that we may realize states absolutely continuous with respect to the same \u00b5 in the same Hilbert space. In (48) it is clear that the integrand at each point x is a linear functional in A \u2208 K, hence given by a density operator \u03c1x. By taking linear combinations and norm limits we can write this in terms of the operator valued function A(x) = \u2211 j fj(x)Aj as\n\u03c9(A) =: \u27e8\u03c9,A\u27e9 = \u222b \u00b5(dx)m(x) tr(\u03c1xA(x)), (49)\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-04, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 25\nor, in a useful shorthand notation, \u03c9 = \u222b \u2295 \u00b5(dx)m(x) \u03c1x. (50)\nEquation (49) is the relation we want to extend to a much larger class of operator valued functions x 7\u2192 A(x).\nIt is worth noting that \u03c1x could be modified on \u00b5-null sets without change, and for the sake of this integral expression, A(x) might be similarly modified. This is the hallmark of the \u00b5-dependent approach. The states obtained with fixed \u00b5 are in the tensor product T (H) \u2297 L1(X,\u00b5), the norm completion of the span of the product states \u03c1 \u2297 m for which \u03c1x \u2261 \u03c1 is constant. We can also express this by the map\ni\u00b5 : T (H) \u2297 L1(X,\u00b5) \u2192 A\u2217 : \u27e8i\u00b5(\u03c1\u2297m), A\u27e9 = \u222b \u00b5(dx)m(x) tr(\u03c1A(x)). (51)\nThis provides the first (\u201c\u00b5-dependent\u201d) way of associating operator valued functions to elements of A\u2217\u2217: For every A \u2208 A\u2217\u2217 we can consider i\u2217\u00b5(A) \u2208 B(H)\u2297L\u221e(X,\u00b5), the von Neumann algebra tensor product [14, Ch. IV.5], which is the dual of T (H) \u2297 L1(X,\u00b5), and also the von Neumann algebra generated by A in its representation on H \u2297L2(X,\u00b5). Note that while i\u2217\u00b5 is onto, it is not injective: all details of A related to \u00b5-null sets are obliterated.\nThe \u00b5-free alternative is given by the formula\n\u27e8\u03c1\u2297 \u03b4x, A\u27e9 = tr \u03c1A\u030c(x) for A \u2208 A\u2217\u2217. (52)\nThis is based on the observation, that for fixed A the evaluation on the left hand side is a bounded linear functional with respect to \u03c1, and thus of the given form with a unique A\u030c(x) \u2208 B(H). For fixed x this extends the point evaluation at x, i.e., (id \u2297 \u03b4x) : K \u2297 C0(X) \u2192 K, to functions in A. It is an extension by continuity for the weak topology induced by A\u2217 so A\u030c(x) = (id \u2297 \u03b4x)\u2217\u2217(A).\nTo contrast these approaches, take \u00b5 to be Lebesgue measure, or any other \u201cdiffuse\u201d measure assigning \u00b5({x}) = 0 to every singleton. Let z\u00b5 be the common support projection of the states i\u00b5(\u03c1\u2297m), i.e., the smallest projection in the W*-algebra A\u2217\u2217 which gives probability 1 to all such states. Then, since \u03b4x and \u00b5 are disjoint, their support projections in C0(X)\u2217\u2217 are orthogonal, so z\u030c\u00b5 = 0, although i\u2217\u00b5(z\u00b5) = 1. Similarly, we can consider za, the smallest projection in A\u2217\u2217 giving 1 on all pure states |\u03c8\u27e9\u27e8\u03c8| \u2297 \u03b4x. In this case i\u2217\u00b5(za) = 0, although z\u030ca(x) = 1 for all x. So the two ways of assigning a function can be diametrically opposite. On the other hand, for A \u2208 A, both approaches give the continuous function representation that we started from, although i\u2217\u00b5(A) is strictly speaking an equivalence class up to \u00b5-a.e. equality. The question is then how far we can extend this agreement, if we avoid \u201cwild\u201d elements like z\u00b5 and za. In the following proposition this is answered by the notion of universal measurability, and illustrated in Fig. 3.\nProposition 13. Let A \u2208 U(A), and let \u03c9 = \u222b \u2295 \u00b5(dx)m(x) \u03c1x \u2208 A\u2217 be a state. Then the function x 7\u2192 tr \u03c1xA\u030c(x) is \u00b5-measurable, and \u00b5-almost everywhere equal to i\u2217\u00b5(A). Moreover,\n\u27e8\u03c9,A\u27e9 = \u222b \u00b5(dx)m(x) tr(\u03c1xA\u030c(x)). (53)\nand \u2225A\u2225 = supx \u2225A\u030c(x)\u2225.\nProof. Fix a state \u03c9, and consider an increasing net Ai \u2208 Ah + R1I with limit A \u2208 A\u2191. Then from (52) we find A\u030c(x) = supi Ai(x). Also in (49) the limit exists and by the monotone convergence theorem the integrand is indeed given by the pointwise supremum, i.e., tr(\u03c1xA\u030c(x)). This shows the claim for A \u2208 A\u2191, and, of course, for A \u2208 A\u2193.\nNow suppose A \u2208 U(A), and \u03b5 > 0. Then we can find X \u2208 A\u2191, Y \u2208 A\u2193 such that X \u2264 A \u2264 Y and \u27e8\u03c9, Y \u2212 X\u27e9 \u2264 \u03b5. Let us first consider the case \u03c9 = \u03c1 \u2297 m with fixed \u03c1. Then the function a\u03c1(x) = tr(\u03c1A\u030c), and the similarly defined functions forX,Y (which are lower/upper semicontinuous satisfy x\u03c1 \u2264 a\u03c1 \u2264 y\u03c1 and their integrals with m\u00b5 differ by less than \u03b5. By Def. 11 we conclude that a\u03c1 is universally measurable. This establishes the \u00b5-measurability of the integrand in (53) for constant \u03c1, and the formula itself. Hence i\u2217\u00b5(A)(x) = A\u030c(x), \u00b5-almost everywhere.\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-04, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 26\nClearly, this extends to linear combinations \u2211\ni \u03c1i \u2297 mi. These are norm dense in T (H) \u2297 L1(X,\u00b5). Thus approximating a general state (50) by such step functions we find that the functions x 7\u2192 m(x) tr(\u03c1xA\u030c(x)) converges in L1(X,\u00b5). So the limit is \u00b5-measurable and the formula holds in general. We note that the function x 7\u2192 tr(\u03c1xA\u030c(x)) is not universally measurable, since the \u03c1x depend on \u00b5.\nFor the norm equality we invoke the result [14, Thm. III.6.37] that the atomic representation is isometric on U(A). Thus we only have to show that supx \u2225A\u030c(x)\u2225 = sup\u03c9 pure \u2225\u03c0\u03c9(A)\u2225, where the supremum is over all pure states, and \u03c0\u03c9 denotes the associated GNS representation. Now the pure states are of the form \u03c9 = |\u03c8\u27e9\u27e8\u03c8|\u2297\u03b4x with \u03c8 \u2208 H, so we only have to show that \u2225A\u030c(x)\u2225 = \u2225\u03c0\u03c9(A)\u2225 for any pure state of this form, i.e., the right hand side does not depend on \u03c8. Indeed, we will show that even \u03c0\u03c9(A) = A\u030c(x) up to the usual isomorphism around the GNS representation: By the discussion after the definition (52) of A\u030c(x), (id \u2297 \u03b4x)\u2217\u2217 is a normal representation of A\u2217\u2217 on B(H), which is obviously irreducible, hence cyclic for any vector. Hence if we identify \u03c8 as the GNS vector, it exactly meets the description of \u03c0\u03c9.\nProposition 14. Let X be locally compact, K the algebra of compact operators on a separable Hilbert space H1, and set A = C0(X,K). Then for A \u2208 M(A) the function A\u030c is strong*-continuous, i.e., x 7\u2192 A\u030c(x)\u03c8 and x 7\u2192 A\u030c(x)\u2217\u03c8 are both continuous for all \u03c8 \u2208 H. Conversely, every uniformly bounded function A\u030c with this property defines a multiplier A \u2208 M(A).\nSketch of proof: This is found in [78, Cor 3.4]. We nevertheless sketch the basic ideas of an approach not using the full-fledged theory.\nAccording to Def. 11, multipliers can be thought of in terms of the operators\nLm, Rm : A \u2192 A, Lm(A) = mA, Rm(A) = Am. (54)\nTheir characteristic feature is Lm(AB) = Lm(A)B, and similarly for Rm. We note that the whole concept is redundant for C*-algebras with a unit, since then we just get multiplication with Lm(1I) = m \u2208 A. This suggests that the application of Lm(U\u03bb) for a bounded approximate unit U\u03bb may help to characterize the action of Lm.\nThe first observation in the hybrid context is that these operators act pointwise, i.e., ( Lm(A) ) (x) depends only on A(x), or, equivalently: A(x) = 0 \u21d2 (LmA)(x) = 0. To show this, assume A(x) = 0, and take a bounded approximate unit U\u03bb \u2208 A with \u2225U\u03bbA \u2212 A\u2225 \u2192 0 for all A \u2208 A. Then, because Lm and U\u03bb are bounded, and the product in A is defined\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-04, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 27\npointwise:\n\u2225(LmA)(x)\u2225 \u2264 \u2225(Lm(A\u2212 U\u03bbA))(x)\u2225 + \u2225Lm(U\u03bb)(x)A(x)\u2225 (55) \u2264 \u2225A\u2212 U\u03bbA\u2225 + \u2225(Lm(U\u03bb))(x)\u2225 \u2225A(x)\u2225. (56)\nThen the second term is equal to zero, and the first goes to zero as \u03bb \u2192 0. It follows that Lm(A)(x) = Lxm(A(x)), where Lxm is a multiplier of K in the sense that it satisfies the basic relation Lxm(AB) = Lxm(A)B for A,B \u2208 K. Now the multiplier algebra of K is known to be M(K) = B(H). Indeed, for A = |\u03a6\u27e9\u27e8\u03a8| with a unit vector \u03a8, we get\nLxm(A) = Lxm(A|\u03a8\u27e9\u27e8\u03a8|) = Lxm(A)|\u03a8\u27e9\u27e8\u03a8| = |\u03a6\u0303\u27e9\u27e8\u03a8| (57)\nfor a suitable vector \u03a6\u0303. Clearly, the map \u03a6 \u2192 \u03a6\u0303 is linear, so we can set \u03a6\u0303 = M(x)\u03a6 for an operator M(x), which is easily checked to be bounded. Since the operators |\u03a6\u27e9\u27e8\u03a8| span a dense subspace of the compact operators, Lxm(A) = M(x)A.\nOn the right side we get Rm(A)(x) = ( Lm\u2217(A\u2217)(x) )\u2217 = (M(x)\u2217(A\u2217(x)))\u2217 = A(x)M(x). It remains to check the continuity of M . To this end, we choose \u03a6,\u03a8 to be constant in a neighborhood of x. Then M(x)|\u03a6\u27e9\u27e8\u03a8| has to be a norm continuous function, i.e., M(x)\u03a6 is continuous in norm. Using the right multiplier instead, we find that M(x)\u2217\u03a8 likewise has to be continuous.\nThis concludes the argument starting from the multiplier condition. For the converse assume that, x 7\u2192 A(x) is strong*-continuous, and K \u2208 C0(X,K). We have to show that AK,KA \u2208 C0(X,K). For this we can assume that K is in a set, whose linear hull is norm dense, namely the functions K = |\u03c8\u27e9\u27e8\u03c8| \u2297 f with \u03c8 \u2208 H1 and f \u2208 C0(X) with compact support. By assumption, A\u03c8 is then norm continuous in H1, and so AK is norm continuous. Since f has compact support, so does AK. The argument for KA \u2208 C0(X,K) is analogous.\nWe remark that in [78, Cor 3.4] the compacts are replaced by a more general algebra. The continuity is then in the natural topology for multipliers, the so-called strict topology, which is given by the seminorms \u2225m\u2225A = \u2225LmA\u2225+\u2225RmA\u2225. For the compact operators, this coincides with the s*-topology [79, I.8.6.3].\nWe do not have a similarly characterization of U(A). In that case it is clear from the proof of Prop. 13, that \u03c8 7\u2192 \u27e8\u03c8, A\u030c(x)\u03c8\u27e9 must be universally measurable on X, and bounded by \u2225A\u2225\u2225\u03c8\u22252. This is enough to get the function representation (53) of some element in A \u2208 A\u2217\u2217, but it is unclear (to us) whether this suffices to conclude A \u2208 U(A). However, in the direction of stronger continuity conditions we record the following for later use:\nCorollary 15. Assume that X = Rn, and denote by \u03b1x : A \u2192 A the translation of functions, i.e., (\u03b1xA)(y) = A(x+ y). Then (52) provides a bijective correspondence between\n(1) elements A \u2208 U(A), which are strongly continuous for \u03b1\u2217\u2217, i.e., limx\u21920 \u2225A \u2212 \u03b1\u2217\u2217x (A)\u2225 = 0, and\n(2) functions A\u030c : X \u2192 B(H1), which are uniformly continuous in the sense that \u2225A\u030c(x) \u2212 A\u030c(y)\u2225 \u2264 \u03b5 if |x\u2212 y| \u2264 \u03b4.\nSuch elements automatically are in M(A).\nProof. Starting from (1), let A\u030c be the function defined by (52). Then the action of translations on the functions in A = K \u2297 C0(X) is lifted to the functions A\u030c. With the sign conventions analogous to (36), we get tr \u03c1(\u03b1xA)(y) = \u27e8\u03c1 \u2297 \u03b4y, \u03b1x(A)\u27e9 = \u27e8\u03c1 \u2297 \u03b4x+y, A\u27e9 = tr \u03c1A\u030c(x + y), and therefore (\u03b1\u2217\u2217x A)(y) = A\u030c(x+ y). By Prop. 13,\n\u2225A\u2212 \u03b1\u2217\u2217x (A)\u2225 = sup y \u2225A\u030c(y) \u2212 A\u030c(y + x)\u2225. (58)\nBy assumption this goes to zero as x \u2192 0, which is the stated uniform continuity with a coordinate change.\nFor the converse, uniform continuity of A\u030c implies the strong*-continuity of Prop. 14, so A\u030c defines a multiplier A \u2208 M(A), and the strong continuity estimate is again (58).\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-04, click title to verify.

One often finds it stated for single real random variables [80]. Here is a sketch for many, possibly quantum variables. It is often used under the apparently weaker assumption that the pointwise limit of the characteristic functions \u03c7n happens to be continuous, but not necessarily itself a characteristic function. In that case, however, we may invoke Bochner\u2019s Theorem to find the state \u03c9\u221e, and apply the version given here.\nProposition 16. Let \u03c9n, n \u2208 N \u222a {\u221e}, be states in C\u2217(\u039e, \u03c3)\u2217 with characteristic functions \u03c7n.

By assumption, the expectations for u \u2208 C\u2217(\u039e, \u03c3) converge, so we also have \u27e8\u03c9n, u\u27e9 \u2265 1 \u2212 \u03b5 for sufficiently large n.

            "heading": "3.4 Tensor product or function space?",
            "text": "This section provides some background that is not strictly needed in our approach. In quantum information the composition of systems is generally thought of as a tensor product of finite dimensional observable algebras. This misses some subtleties, in particular for hybrids, when the parameter space of classical system is not finite and also not compact. These are related to the question of Sect. 3.2, of representing hybrid observables as functions on the classical parameter space.\nLet us consider the tensor product approach to the combination of a classical part, described by some algebra of functions on X and a quantum part with observable algebra A1 = B(H). It turns out that for hybrids, it is not so obvious how such a tensor product should be defined or whether the C*-tensor product is even a good way to describe this kind of composition. Sect. 3.2 raises a doubt in this regard: While at the level of the algebras C\u2217(\u039e, \u03c3) the classical and quantum part are combined by a C*-tensor product (see Prop. 6), the same is not true for the enlarged observable algebras such as M(\u039e, \u03c3). While all the enlarged observable algebras in Fig. 3 consist of functions X \u2192 B(H1) with varying degrees of regularity, they cannot be written as a tensor product of classical and quantum parts. In this subsection, we discuss some aspects of this failure of tensor products.\nTo begin with, the tensor product of C*-algebras is in general not uniquely defined [14]: There is a minimal and a maximal choice of C*-norms on the linear algebra tensor product, which are in general different. However, all cross norms coincide if one of the algebras is abelian, so we will not\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-04, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 29\nhave to worry about this ambiguity. This is the tensor product used in the basic hybrid algebra A = C0(X,K) \u223c= K \u2297 C0(X).\nHowever, we also need to include observables that do not decay at infinity and non-compact operators on the quantum side. Therefore, the question arises, whether for some algebra A1 (in our applications either K or B(H)) this sort of isomorphism also holds for the bounded A1-valued norm continuous functions Cb(X,A1) with the C*-tensor product A1 \u2297 Cb(X). The candidate for this isomorphism is\n\u03b9 : A1 \u2297 Cb(X) \u2192 Cb(X,A1), \u03b9 ( A\u2297 f ) (x) = f(x)A. (59)\nThis clearly can be extended to a *-homomorphism. When X is compact, this is even an isomorphism [76, Prop. 1.22.3], and the subscript b can be dropped because continuous functions are automatically bounded.\nHowever, we are interested in a locally compact space X = \u039e0 = Rs. In that case, the embedding \u03b9 is not surjective [81]. To see this, note that Cb(X) = C(\u03b2X), where \u03b2X is the Stone\u2013 \u010cech compactification, so we have \u03b9(A1 \u2297 Cb(X)) = C(\u03b2X,A1). But the continuity of a bounded function F : X \u2192 A1 does not necessarily imply the existence of a norm continuous extension to \u03b2X. In fact, if such an extension exists, the range F (X) = {F (x)|x \u2208 X} must have norm compact closure F (\u03b2X) \u2282 A1. As shown by Williams [81] this is precisely what could go wrong, i.e., we can turn this into a criterion describing the range of \u03b9.\nExample 17. An element F \u2208 Cb(X,A1) with F /\u2208 \u03b9(A1 \u2297 Cb(X)). \u25b7 Take F (x) = \u2211 i Pifi(x), where Pi is a family of orthogonal projections, e.g., in A1 = K(H). The fi are chosen to have disjoint supports in the elements of some countable partition of X, are positive, take the value 1 somewhere, and \u2211 i fi = 1I. For example, with some fixed function f0 \u2208 C0(R), such that f0(0) = 1 and f0(x) = 0 for |x| > 1/3, we can set fi(x) = f(x \u2212 i). Then {Pi} \u2282 F (X) does not have norm compact closure. Note that the sum defining F cannot be obtained as a supremum-norm limit of finite partial sums, as would be required for F \u2208 A1 \u2297Cb(X). \u25c1\nAs a consequence, it is preferable to consider the larger algebra Cb(X,A1), rather than the tensor product, as a basic hybrid algebra. Note, however, that we can also change the topology of A1 for which we demand continuity. For example, consider A1 = B(H), taken with the weak*-topology, and hence the space Cw(X,B(H)) of norm bounded, weak*- continuous functions X \u2192 B(H). Since the unit ball of B(H) is now compact, the above argument of Williams no longer applies. Indeed if F \u2208 Cw(X,B(H)), and \u03c1 \u2208 B(H)\u2217, the function x 7\u2192 tr \u03c1F (x) is bounded and continuous, and hence extends to \u03b2X. The value F\u03c1(x\u0302) of this function at a point x\u0302 \u2208 \u03b2X is a bounded linear functional with respect to \u03c1, and there is an operator F (x\u0302) representing this functional. In other words\nCw(X,B(H)) = Cw(\u03b2X,B(H)). (60)\nIt is not obvious that this is even an algebra because the operator product is not continuous in the weak*-topology. However, it is still an order unit Banach space with well-defined positive cone and unit, so it is eligible as a space of observables (in the sense of positive operator valued measures). The same is true for U(\u039e, \u03c3).\nAs Prop. 14 shows, the multiplier algebra M(C0(X,K)) can also be considered as a set of operator-valued functions, and is clearly contained in Cw(X,B(H)). In this case, the algebraic product is well defined, which is readily seen both abstractly, by the definition of multipliers, and concretely, as the strong* operator topology is compatible with products. It is interesting to note that Cw(X,B(H)) and M(C0(X,K)) share the same \u201cclassical part\u201d, or center, namely the scalar functions C(\u03b2X) \u223c= Cb(X). Here the center of an order unit space is spanned by the observables, which can be jointly measured with all others."

Published under CC-BY 4.0. 30\nTo this end we need to introduce a notation for the translation maps themselves. In terms of canonical operators in a standard representation, a phase space shift acts as\nR\u2032j = Rj + \u03b7j1I, (61)\nwhere 1I stands for the identity operator or the constant 1-function. The size of the shift depends on j, and together these parameters form the components of a vector \u03b7 \u2208 \u039e. In terms of Weyl operators, this means\nW \u2032(\u03be) = exp(i\u03be\u00b7R\u2032) = exp(i\u03be\u00b7\u03b7)W (\u03be) =: \u03b1\u03b7 ( W (\u03be) ) . (62)\nHere we have introduced the automorphism \u03b1\u03b7, which expresses this symmetry as an automorphism on observables. If we think of W (\u03be) as an operator-valued function on \u039e0, we have to define it on more general operator-valued functions as computed in (36), i.e.\n\u03b1\u03b7(F )(x) = W (\u03c3\u03b7)\u2217F (x+ \u03b70)W (\u03c3\u03b7), (63)\nwhere \u03b7 = \u03b71 \u2295\u03b70. This formula makes sense for any of the observable algebras that are built from B(H1)-valued bounded functions on \u039e0, including the CCR-algebra in any standard representation, hence also C\u2217(\u039e, \u03c3). On standard states it is equivalent to\n\u03b1\u2217\u03b7(\u03b4x \u2297 \u03c1) = \u03b4x\u2212\u03b70 \u2297W (\u03c3\u03b7)\u03c1W (\u03c3\u03b7)\u2217. (64)\nIf we define \u03b1\u03b7 as an automorphism group on C\u2217(\u039e, \u03c3), in (62) we should really write \u03b1\u2217\u2217\u03b7 , but we will continue to use the same symbol also for this map. Then (62) just says that the Weyl operators W (\u03be) \u2208 C\u2217(\u039e, \u03c3)\u2217\u2217 are joint eigenvectors of all translations. It will be crucial later on to turn this around:\nLemma 18. Suppose that for some F \u2208 U(\u039e, \u03c3) we have \u03b1\u03b7(F ) = \u03bb(\u03b7)F , for all \u03b7 and a suitable function \u03bb : \u039e \u2192 C. Then there is \u03be \u2208 \u039e and c \u2208 C, such that F = cW (\u03be), and \u03bb(\u03b7) = exp(i\u03be\u00b7\u03b7). Proof. Note first that we must have \u03bb(\u03b7 + \u03b7\u2032) = \u03bb(\u03b7)\u03bb(\u03b7\u2032). Moreover, \u03bb must be a universally measurable function on \u039e [82, Prop. 7.4.5]. Since the only measurable characters on R2s+n are exponentials, we conclude that \u03bb(\u03b7) = exp(i\u03be\u00b7\u03b7).\nConsider F \u2032 = FW (\u03be)\u2217. Then because \u03b1 is a group of automorphisms, and W (\u03be) satisfies the required eigenvalue equation (62), we get that \u03b1\u03b7(F \u2032) = F \u2032. It remains to prove that this implies that F \u2032 = c1I, since then F = F \u2032W (\u03be) = cW (\u03be).\nIt suffices to prove this in every standard representation, where Eq. (63) has a direct interpretation. Then, for all \u03b70, \u03b71, W (\u03c31\u03b71)\u2217F \u2032(x + \u03b70)W (\u03c31\u03b71) = F \u2032(x), where the operators W (\u00b7) are Weyl operators in the Schr\u00f6dinger representation. Setting first \u03b70 = 0 we thus conclude that F (x) = f(x)1I by irreducibility of the standard quantum Weyl operators. By setting \u03b71 = 0, we get that this f must be constant. Hence F \u2032(x) = c1I.\nExample 19. Measurability F \u2208 U(\u039e, \u03c3) is required. \u25b7 For simplicity, we will construct an example in the classical case (\u03c3 = 0). Let \u03be \u2192 \u03bb(\u03be) be an arbitrary homomorphism Rn \u2192 C into the unit circle, of which we do not require any continuity or measurability. It is well known that there are many discontinuous \u03bb, which are then necessarily non-measurable (see [83, Ex. 3.2.4] or the review [84]). A simple construction uses a Hamel basis of Rn as a vector space over Q, i.e., a set of elements ej , j \u2208 J such that every \u03b7 \u2208 Rn can be written uniquely as a finite linear combination \u03b7 = \u2211 j \u03b7jej . Then we just set \u03bb(\u03b7) = exp i \u2211 j ai\u03b7i, for arbitrary constants ai. It is easily arranged that such a function is not continuous. Now consider the set\nM = { F \u2208 C\u2217(\u039e, \u03c3)\u2217\u2217 \u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2225F\u2225 \u2264 1, and, for all \u03be: \u03b4\u03be(F ) = \u03bb(\u03be)}. (65) As a weak*-closed subset of the unit sphere, it is compact, and it is nonempty because we can define F as a functional on the linear combinations of point measures by the condition in M and then choose a Hahn\u2013Banach extension. Now define the transformations \u03b2\u03b7 = \u03bb(\u03b7)\u03b1\u2217\u2217\u03b7 . Because \u03bb is a character, these maps leave M invariant. They are also continuous and commute. Hence, by the Markov\u2013Kakutani Fixed Point Theorem, they have a common fixed point F . F must be non-zero because it is in M, and as a fixed point of the \u03b2\u03b7, it satisfies the equation \u03b1\u2217\u2217\u03b7 F = \u03bb(\u03b7)F . But since \u03bb is not continuous, it cannot be of the form given in the lemma. \u25c1\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-04, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 31"

            "heading": "3.6 Correspondence for spaces of strongly continuous observables",
            "text": "We saw in Sect. 3.2 that hybrid observables in M(X,K) are given by strong* continuous operator valued functions on X. Here we will study a class with stronger continuity properties: On one hand we demand the continuity to be in operator norm, and on the other that it be uniform in X. This combination gives the continuity of \u03be 7\u2192 \u03b1\u2217\u2217\u03be (A) in the norm of the hybrid bidual. In other words, F is strongly continuous for the translations. Since this property can be stated without explicitly observing the classical-quantum split, it will be easy to establish an automatic Heisenberg picture for quasifree channels (Prop. 26), even if quantum and classical degrees are strongly coupled.\nFor defining a suitable space of strongly continuous observables we will make sure that the observable A has a good function representation in the first place, i.e., A \u2208 U(\u039e, \u03c3). This excludes unwanted elements like 1I \u2212 za, which is even invariant under all \u03b1\u2217\u2217\u03be but has a vanishing function representation, as noted above. That is, we define\nCu(\u039e, \u03c3) = {A \u2208 U(\u039e, \u03c3) | lim \u03b7\u21920 \u2225F \u2212 \u03b1\u2217\u2217\u03b7 (F )\u2225 = 0}. (66)\nIn this definition we do not distinguish between quantum and classical translation directions. Restricting just to the classical part, Cor. 15 shows that Cu(\u039e, \u03c3) \u2282 M(\u039e, \u03c3). In addition the argument A\u030c(\u03be0) \u2208 B(H1) has to be strongly continuous for the quantum translations, and uniformly so with respect to \u03be0.\nA basic example is also given by the Weyl operators: Since \u03b1\u2217\u2217\u03be W (\u03b7) = exp(i\u03be \u00b7 \u03b7)W (\u03b7), the required continuity is immediate from the continuity of the phase factor. This shows that CCR(\u039e, \u03c3) \u2282 Cu(\u039e, \u03c3).\nThe algebra Cu(\u039e, \u03c3) is still rather large, for example, not separable. In the context of Ludwig\u2019s axiomatic approach, it seemed natural to single out a norm separable subspace D \u2282 B(H) as a space of physical observables. One role of the space D would be to determine a more realistic assessment of the distinguishability of states compared to norm or weak topologies. It turned out [27, 13] that in systems with canonical variables, the choices for D on the quantum side are in one-to-one correspondence with choices on the classical side, which, in turn, can often be understood in terms of compactifications of phase space. For example, the CCR-algebra corresponds to the almost periodic functions and the Bohr compactification, whereas the compact operators correspond to C0(\u039e) and adjoining the identity to the one-point compactification of X. In this section we will show that the correspondence naturally also covers the hybrids between the fully quantum and the fully classical case. That is, the lattice of translation invariant closed subspaces of Cu(\u039e, \u03c3) does not depend on \u03c3.\nThis correspondence is best expressed in terms of the following notion of convolution. We denote by \u03b2\u2212 the automorphism of phase space inversion, satisfying \u03b2\u2212(W (\u03be)) = W (\u2212\u03be), which is given by a coordinate change \u03be0 7\u2192 \u2212\u03be0 on the classical part and is implemented by the parity operator on the quantum part. The sign freedom in the following definition is due to the fact that C\u2217(\u039e, \u03c3)\u2217 = C\u2217(\u039e,\u2212\u03c3)\u2217: The twisted positive definiteness conditions (20) for \u03c3 and \u2212\u03c3 both imply hermiticity (\u03c7(\u2212\u03be) = \u03c7(\u03be)), and with \u03bek 7\u2192 \u2212\u03bek and complex conjugation they become equivalent.\nDefinition 20. Let \u039e be a real vector space with antisymmetric forms \u03c31 and \u03c32 and fix some signs si = \u00b11 for i = 1, 2. Then, for states \u03c9i \u2208 C\u2217(\u039e, \u03c3i)\u2217 with characteristic functions \u03c7i, we define their convolution, denoted by \u03c91 \u2217 \u03c92 \u2208 C\u2217(\u039e, s1\u03c31 + s2\u03c32)\u2217 by its characteristic function \u03c7(\u03be) = \u03c71(\u03be)\u03c72(\u03be). For \u03c9 \u2208 C\u2217(\u039e, \u03c31)\u2217 and F \u2208 C\u2217(\u039e, \u03c32)\u2217\u2217, we define \u03c9 \u2217 F = F \u2217 \u03c9 \u2208 C\u2217(\u039e, s1\u03c31 + s2\u03c32)\u2217\u2217 by evaluating it on an arbitrary \u03c9\u2032 \u2208 C\u2217(\u039e, s1\u03c31 + s2\u03c32)\u2217:\n\u27e8\u03c9\u2032, \u03c9 \u2217 F \u27e9 = \u27e8\u03c9\u2032 \u2217 (\u03b2\u2212\u03c9), F \u27e9. (67)\nConvolution is a bilinear operation C\u2217(\u039e, \u03c31)\u2217 \u00d7 C\u2217(\u039e, \u03c32)\u2217 \u2192 C\u2217(\u039e, s1\u03c31 + s2\u03c32)\u2217, which is obviously commutative, associative, and bi-positive. It is also translation invariant in the sense that \u03b1\u03be(\u03c9 \u2217F ) = (\u03b1\u03be\u03c9) \u2217F = \u03c9 \u2217 (\u03b1\u03beF ), which also shows why \u03b2\u2212 is needed in (67). The freedom of the sign in the definition is used to get a classical state or observable function as the convolution of two quantum objects.\nFor pointwise estimates it is useful to have a direct formula for the convolution, which bypasses the Fourier transform. When one factor is \u03c9 \u2208 C\u2217(\u039e, 0)\u2217, e.g. a classical probability measure on\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-04, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 32\n\u039e, this is the usual average over translates of the other factor: \u03c9 \u2217 F = \u222b \u03c9(d\u03be) \u03b1\u03be(F ), (68)\nwhere F could be an observable or another state, and the symplectic form is the same for F and \u03c9 \u2217 F . For a state \u03c9 \u2208 C\u2217(\u039e, \u03c3)\u2217 and an observable F \u2208 Cu(\u039e, \u03c3) on the same hybrid, we get a uniformly continuous function \u03c9 \u2217 F \u2208 Cu(\u039e, 0):(\n\u03c9 \u2217 F ) (\u03be) = \u03c9 ( \u03b1\u03be\u03b2\u2212(F ) ) . (69)\nThe hybrid generalization of correspondence theory [27, 85] is given in the following proposition. \u03c9 \u2208 C\u2217(\u039e, \u03c31 \u2212 \u03c32)\u2217 is called regular if it is norm continuous under translations (cf. Prop. 7) and its characteristic function vanishes nowhere.\nProposition 21. Let \u039e be a vector space. Then the lattice of \u03b1-invariant closed subspaces of Cu(\u039e, \u03c3) does not depend on \u03c3. More precisely, let Di \u2282 Cu(\u039e, \u03c3i) be \u03b1-invariant closed subspaces, and \u03c90 \u2208 C\u2217(\u039e, \u03c31 \u2212 \u03c32)\u2217 regular. Then the following are equivalent:\n(1) \u03c9 \u2217 D1 \u2282 D2 and \u03c9 \u2217 D2 \u2282 D1 for all \u03c9 \u2208 C\u2217(\u039e, \u03c31 \u2212 \u03c32)\u2217.\n(2) The inclusions (1) hold for \u03c9 = \u03c90.\n(3) D2 is the closure of \u03c90 \u2217 D1.\n(4) D2 = {A \u2208 Cu(\u039e, \u03c31) | \u03c90 \u2217A \u2208 D1}.\nNote that because (1) does not depend on \u03c90, each of the following items holds for all regular \u03c90 if it holds for any one, and by the same token, is also equivalent to the same condition with D1 and D2 exchanged.\nProof. (See [27, Thm. 4.1] for more details.) The crucial fact here is Wiener\u2019s approximation theorem, which states that the translates of \u03c1 \u2208 L1(\u039e, d\u03be) span a norm dense subspace iff the Fourier transform vanishes nowhere. These are precisely the regular elements of C\u2217(\u039e, 0)\u2217. The proof uses the following arguments:\nLemma 22. Let D \u2282 Cu(\u039e, \u03c3) be an \u03b1-invariant closed subspace, and \u03c1 \u2208 C\u2217(\u039e, 0)\u2217. Then\n(1) \u03c1 \u2217 D \u2282 D,\n(2) when \u03c1 is regular, this inclusion is norm dense.\nProof. (1) Now, \u03c1 is a classical standard state, i.e., a probability measure on \u039e. The convolution integral \u03c1 \u2217 A = \u222b \u03c1(d\u03be)\u03b1\u03be\u03b2\u2212(A) can be approximated for strongly continuous A by partitioning the integration domain into regions, over which either \u03b1\u03be(A) changes little, or which have small total weight with respect to \u03c1. We may then replace \u03b1\u03be(A) by a constant in each region, thus approximating the convolution uniformly by a linear combination of translates \u03b1\u03be(A).\n(2) For A \u2208 Cu(\u039e, \u03c3) we can find \u03c1\u2032 \u2208 L1 with sufficiently small support around the origin so that \u2225\u03c1\u2032 \u2217 A \u2212 A\u2225 is small. Approximating \u03c1\u2032 by a linear combination of translates \u03b1\u03be\u03c1, we find that A itself lies in the closure of the translation-invariant subspace generated by \u03c1 \u2217A.\nComing back to the proof of the proposition, note that (1)\u21d2(2) is trivial. Given (2) we get \u03c90 \u2217 \u03c90 \u2217 D1 \u2282 \u03c90 \u2217 D2 \u2282 D1. But since \u03c90 \u2217 \u03c90 is regular this inclusion is dense, which proves (3).\nNext, we verify (3)\u21d4(4) by showing that the spaces defined by these conditions, that we temporarily call D(3)2 and D (4) 2 , are equivalent. Suppose that A \u2208 D (4) 2 . Then because A \u2208 Cu(\u039e, \u03c32), A lies in the closed translation invariant subspace generated by \u03c90 \u2217 \u03c90 \u2217 A \u2208 \u03c90 \u2217 D1, which is D(3)2 . Conversely, if A \u2208 D (3) 2 , it can be approximated by elements of the form \u03c90 \u2217A1, so \u03c90 \u2217A \u2248 \u03c90 \u2217 \u03c90 \u2217A1 \u2208 D1, which means that A \u2208 D(4)2 . It remains to show that (3)\u21d2(1). Indeed \u03c9 \u2217 D2 \u2282 \u03c9 \u2217 \u03c90 \u2217 D1 \u2282 D1. On the other hand, since \u03c90\u2217\u03c90\u2217D1 \u2282 D1 is dense, we find for arbitrary \u03c9: \u03c9\u2217D1 \u2282 \u03c9 \u2217 \u03c90 \u2217 \u03c90 \u2217 D1 \u2282 \u03c9 \u2217 \u03c90 \u2217 D2 \u2282 D2.\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-04, click title to verify.

            "text": "The notion of quasifree states and operations arose in field theory and statistical mechanics [3, 2, 54]. In statistical mechanics, a free time evolution is the non-interacting time evolution of a many-particle system. Indeed, in the absence of interaction, the time evolution on the one-particle Hilbert space should be automatically lifted to an evolution for the full system. Similarly, in field theory, one may get an evolution of the quantum field from a transformation of the test function space. In the setting of this paper, we are much less ambitious since our phase spaces, the analog of the one-particle spaces or the test function spaces, are finite-dimensional. We keep as the hallmark of quasifree evolutions that they can be characterized completely by linear operators at the phase space level. In contrast to the typical applications to unitary dynamics, we moreover include irreversible (completely positive) operations and general hybrids (see [22, 86] for some early extensions in the irreversible direction). We do not, however, consider quasifree maps on the CARalgebra [87, 22] since the commutation of classical variables forms a much less happy combination with the anticommutation of fermionic degrees of freedom.\nThe linearity at the phase space level can be expressed as a covariance condition with respect to phase space translations. For general covariant channels, one has to fix representations of the symmetry group under consideration in the input system as well as in the output system, with the desired operations intertwining these two representations. In the case at hand, these will be two representations of the group of phase translations, and the difference between the representations is parametrized by a linear operator S : \u039eout \u2192 \u039ein. Our first step will be to characterize all channels satisfying such a covariance condition plus a regularity condition, which ensures that standard states in the sense of the previous sections are mapped to standard states. The action of these channels on states, i.e., the Schr\u00f6dinger picture, will then be obvious. This was, in fact, the starting point of the present study. However, the corresponding Heisenberg pictures seemed initially rather unclear. Having clarified the necessary spaces in the previous section, we can now go on to apply these ideas and get Heisenberg picture channels for all quasifree channels without the need for any extra assumptions."

It thus takes the input states of a device to the output states. Such channels include measurements when (\u039eout, \u03c3out) is classical (i.e., \u03c3out = 0), preparations (\u039ein = {0}), and all kinds of combinations in which, in addition to an operation on the quantum subsystem, classical information is used as an input, or is read out in the process (cf. Sect. 5). The Heisenberg picture is always denoted by T \u2217, and T \u2217(A) for an observable A of the output system is interpreted as that observable on the input system, which is obtained by first operating with the quantum device and then measuring A. The two pictures are thus related as two ways of viewing the same experiment. Since all observables have expectations in the standard hybrid state, they can be considered as elements of the dual, i.e., C\u2217(\u039e, \u03c3)\u2217\u2217, and from this interpretation, it is clear that T \u2217 must indeed be the Banach space adjoint of T . In the definition we use the notation S\u22a4 : \u039ein \u2192 \u039eout for the linear algebra transpose (or adjoint) of a linear map S : \u039eout \u2192 \u039ein.\nDefinition 23. Let (\u039ein, \u03c3in) and (\u039eout, \u03c3out) be hybrid phase spaces, and S : \u039eout \u2192 \u039ein a linear map. Then an S-covariant channel is a completely positive, normalisation preserving linear operator T : C\u2217(\u039ein, \u03c3in)\u2217 \u2192 C\u2217(\u039eout, \u03c3out)\u2217 such that, for all \u03be \u2208 \u039ein,\nT \u25e6 (\u03b1in\u03be )\u2217 = (\u03b1outS\u22a4\u03be) \u2217 \u25e6 T . (70)\nA quasifree channel is a channel, which is S-covariant for some S.\nThere is an alternative characterization in terms of T \u2217, which also clarifies the data needed to specify an S-covariant channel.\nProposition 24. Let T be an S-covariant channel. Then there is a unique continuous and normalized function f : \u039eout \u2192 C, which is twisted positive definite with respect to the antisymmetric form\n\u2206\u03c3 = \u03c3out \u2212 S\u22a4\u03c3inS, (71)\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-04, click title to verify.

(72)\nConversely, every function f with this property defines an S-covariant channel. Terminology: We will refer to f as the noise function of the channel T , and to the hybrid state on (\u039eout,\u2206\u03c3) with characteristic function f as its noise state, and denote it typically by \u03c4 .\nBefore going into the proof, let us explain why the form (72) determines a unique channel. Prima facie it defines the action of the channel only on the Weyl operators, hence by norm limits on the CCR-algebra, but no further. The point is that the formula really defines a transformation T : C\u2217(\u039ein, \u03c3in)\u2217 \u2192 C\u2217(\u039eout, \u03c3out)\u2217 on states: By taking expectations of (72) with \u03c9in we get the characteristic function of \u03c9out = T \u03c9in as\n\u03c7out(\u03be) = f(\u03be)\u03c7in(S\u03be). (73)\nThis shows that the channel is indeed specified completely by S and f . Another way to put this is to note that since the expectations of Weyl operators specify the state, the linear hull of these operators is weak*- dense in the bidual C\u2217(\u039e, \u03c3)\u2217\u2217, and correspondingly in all the observable spaces. Therefore, (72) suffices to define the Heisenberg picture channel by first a linear extension and then an extension by weak*-continuity.\nProof of Prop. 24. Applying \u03b1in\u03be to (72) and using the eigenvalue equation (62) for Wout(\u03be) we find that\n\u03b1in\u03be \u25e6 T \u2217 ( W (\u03b7) ) = T \u2217 ( \u03b1outS\u22a4\u03be(W (\u03b7)) ) = T \u2217 ( eiS \u22a4\u03be\u00b7\u03b7W (\u03b7) ) = ei\u03be\u00b7S\u03b7T \u2217 ( W (\u03b7) ) . (74)\nThat is, T \u2217 ( W (\u03b7) ) is a joint eigenvector of the translations and hence, by Lem. 18, must be proportional to W (S\u03b7). We denote the proportionality factor by f(\u03b7), see Sect. 3.5. This immediately implies (72). Now we can choose a state \u03c9in such that \u03c7in vanishes nowhere, for example, a Gaussian. Since \u03c7in is continuous by Bochner\u2019s Theorem, and the channel maps standard states to standard states, so \u03c7out is also continuous, we conclude that f is continuous.\nWe now have to analyze the condition for complete positivity. Here one should remember that the channel T is primarily defined on C\u2217(\u039ein, \u03c3in)\u2217 and complete positivity just means that T \u2297idn preserves positivity (i.e., positive semidefiniteness) for all n, where idn is the identity on the n\u00d7n-matrices Mn (viewed as density matrices). In order to give an equivalent formulation in the Heisenberg picture, one can check complete positivity on any subalgebra A \u2282 C\u2217(\u039eout, \u03c3out)\u2217\u2217 so that the positivity of any element of \u03c9n \u2208 C\u2217(\u039eout, \u03c3out)\u2217 \u2297 Mn can be expressed as the positivity of expectation values of positive elements in A \u2297 Mn, i.e., the positive cones are dual to each other. For this, any weak*-dense subalgebra A will do, and we take here the linear span of the Weyl operators for A.\nWe now assume that T \u2217 is completely positive and aim at deriving the stated twisted definiteness condition for f . To this end, we use that, for a completely positive operator T \u2217, and any choice of finitely many aj , bj we have X = \u2211 jk ajT \u2217(b\u2217j bk)a\u2217k \u2265 0. Here we choose aj = cjW (S\u03bej) and bj = W (\u03bej) for an arbitrary choice of \u03be1, . . . , \u03ben \u2208 \u039eout, and cj \u2208 C. The idea is that then X becomes a multiple of the identity, namely\n0 \u2264 X = \u2211 jk cjW (S\u03bej) T \u2217 ( W (\u03bej)\u2217W (\u03bek) ) ckW (S\u03bek)\u2217\n= \u2211 jk cjcke i\u03bej \u00b7\u03c3out\u03bek/2 W (S\u03bej)T \u2217(W (\u2212\u03bej + \u03bek))W (S\u03bek)\u2217\n= \u2211 jk cjcke i\u03bej \u00b7\u03c3out\u03bek/2f(\u2212\u03bej + \u03bek) W (S\u03bej)W (\u2212S\u03bej + S\u03bek)W (S\u03bek)\u2217\n= \u2211 jk cjcke i\u03bej \u00b7\u03c3out\u03bek/2f(\u2212\u03bej + \u03bek) e\u2212i(S\u03bej)\u00b7\u03c3in(S\u03bek)/2 W (S\u03bej)W (S\u03bej)\u2217W (S\u03bek)W (S\u03bek)\u2217\n= \u2211 jk cjf(\u2212\u03bej + \u03bek) ei\u03bej \u00b7\u2206\u03c3\u03bek/2ck 1I.\nThe positivity of this expression for arbitrary cj and \u03bej is exactly the stated twisted definiteness condition. Conversely, when f satisfies the conditions, we can define T acting on C\u2217(\u039ein, \u03c3in)\u2217\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-04, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 35\nby Eq. (73), using Bochner\u2019s Theorem, and Prop. 5. Continuity and normalization of the output characteristic function are then guaranteed by the corresponding properties of f . Positivity will be addressed together with complete positivity.\nWe have to extend Bochner\u2019s Theorem to a version involving an additional tensor factor Mn. So let \u03c9in \u2208 C\u2217(\u039ein, \u03c3in)\u2217 \u2297 Mn be positive. The matrix elements \u03c9in\u03b1\u03b2 then have characteristic functions \u03c7in\u03b1\u03b2(\u03b7) = \u03c9in\u03b1\u03b2(W (\u03b7)), and the positivity condition for \u03c9in is the positivity of the matrix\n\u03c7in\u03b1\u03b2(\u2212\u03b7j + \u03b7k)ei\u03b7j \u00b7\u03c3in\u03b7k/2, (75)\nfor arbitrary \u03b71, . . . , \u03b7N , where the indices of this matrix are considered to be the pairs (\u03b1, j) and (\u03b2, k). Applying the channel T \u2297 idn to \u03c9in means the application of (73) to each matrix element, resulting in a similar matrix for \u03c9out = (T \u2297 idn)\u03c9in, namely\n\u03c7out\u03b1\u03b2 (\u03bei \u2212 \u03bej)e i 2\u03bei\u00b7\u03c3out\u03bej = ( f(\u03bei \u2212 \u03bej)e i 2\u03bei\u00b7\u2206\u03c3\u03bej ) ( \u03c7in\u03b1\u03b2(S\u03bei \u2212 S\u03bej)e i 2S\u03bei\u00b7\u03c3inS\u03bej ) . (76)\nHere we used the definition of \u2206\u03c3. By assumption, the matrix in the first factor is positive definite. The second factor is positive definite because the input state (75) is positive with the substitution \u03b7j = S\u03bej . Hence the left-hand side is also positive definite as the Hadamard product of two positive definite matrices."

            "heading": "4.2 State-channel correspondence",
            "text": "In this section, we will describe in more detail the geometry of the correspondence between an S-covariant channel T and its noise state \u03c4 , which was set up in Prop. 24. The operator S will be fixed, and this is necessary if we want to consider a correspondence of convex sets: The convex combination of quasifree channels with different S is simply not quasifree. However, the design possibilities for channels by engineering \u03c4 are not exhausted by convex combinations. Since arbitrary states are allowed, superpositions work just as well (see, e.g., [88]). We begin with some general remarks on state-channel correspondence and cones in quantum theory.\nState-channel correspondence has been a very useful tool in quantum information theory. It originated in Choi\u2019s thesis [89], which is often cited together with Jamio\u0142kowski [90]2. If we restrict for the moment to finite-dimensional systems, we can summarize this by saying in quantum theory, there is only one isomorphism type of positive cone for the basic objects: For observables it is the elements of the form A\u2217A, for states it is the dual of the observable cone, and for channels it is the completely positive cone. The inclusion of direct sums of positive semidefinite cones extends this statement to quantum-classical hybrid systems. As an immediate consequence, we find that there is only one kind of order interval, which in an ordered vector space is a set of the kind [x1, x2] = {x|x1 \u2264 x \u2264 x2}, which is obviously determined by just the order relations. In particular, the possible decompositions \u03c1 = \u03c11 + \u03c12 of a fixed state \u03c1 into a sum of positive \u03c1i is isomorphic to the corresponding interval [0, 1I] in which decompositions are just two-valued observables, and decompositions T = T1 + T2 of a channel into completely positive terms, i.e., an instrument with overall state change T . This correspondence of order intervals is, in a sense, more robust than the correspondence of cones: It persists in infinite-dimensional systems while the isomorphism of cones breaks down. For example, B(H) has an order unit (an element u so that a \u2264 \u03bbu for all a \u2265 0 and suitable \u03bb, here: u = 1I), whereas the trace class has none.\nFrom the finite-dimensional case, it is clear that the difference between the spaces of states, observables, and channels lies in the respective normalization conditions. This is also reflected in the different structures of the convex sets of normalized elements: The extreme points are the projective Hilbert space for states, the projection lattice for observables, and something more complicated for channels. Moreover, we get different natural norms: The trace norm, the operator norm, and the \u201cnorm of complete boundedness\u201d [91], denoted by \u2225 \u00b7 \u2225cb, which is often also (sometimes only in the Schr\u00f6dingerpicture) referred to as the diamond norm [92]. The cb-norm has a reputation of being not easy to compute [91, 93].\n2However, Jamio\u0142kowski\u2019s work appeared before the importance of complete positivity was generally recognized and gets the right isomorphism only up to an additional partial transpose operation.\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-04, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 36\nOne surprising fact about the isomorphism T \u2194 \u03c4 is that it connects the normalized subsets of different categories: states on the one hand and quasifree channels on the other. In the light of the above explanations this is readily traced to the normalization conditions: For a channel the normalization condition is T \u22171I = 1I, and for general completely positive maps \u2225T \u2225cb = \u2225T \u22171I\u2225. This is not a linear function of T . However, for a general bounded covariant map T , we have shown (see (72) with \u03be = 0) that T \u2217(1I) = f(0)1I, so \u2225T \u2225cb = f(0) = \u2225\u03c4\u2225. So for positive elements, both norms depend only on one number, and this dependence is linear, i.e., the norm is additive on the positive cone. This is exactly what makes a full channel-state correspondence possible here. This feature is shared by other classes of covariant channels, i.e., channels that intertwine automorphic actions of a group G, i.e., (\u03b1outg )\u2217 \u25e6 T = T \u25e6 (\u03b1ing )\u2217 for g \u2208 G. When the \u03b1ing are implemented by an irreducible set of unitaries, a projective representation of G, then, once again, T \u22171I is a multiple of the identity, and the class of covariant channels is affinely isomorphic to a state space of a quantum system that can be computed from the representations involved [94]. We see here that the irreducibility of the implementing unitaries is not the key condition since, on the classical subsystem, no such unitaries exist. Instead, the decisive condition is that the representation on the input side has only the multiples of 1I as invariant elements, in the hybrid case a special case of Lem. 18.\nThe following corollary summarizes the above discussion and lists some transfers-of-properties for the correspondence.\nCorollary 25. Fix hybrid systems with phase spaces (\u039ein, \u03c3in) and (\u039eout, \u03c3out), and a linear map S : \u039eout \u2192 \u039ein. Then there is a bijective correspondence between S-covariant channels T in the sense of Def. 23, and noise states \u03c4 on the hybrid system (\u039eout,\u2206\u03c3) as stated in Prop. 24. Then if T , T1, T2 correspond to \u03c4, \u03c41, \u03c42, respectively, and \u03bb \u2208 R, then\n(1) T = \u03bbT1 + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)T2 iff \u03c4 = \u03bb\u03c41 + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)\u03c42,\n(2) \u03bbT2 \u2212 T1 is completely positive iff \u03bb\u03c42 \u2212 \u03c41 \u2265 0,\n(3) \u2225T1 \u2212 T2\u2225cb = \u2225\u03c41 \u2212 \u03c42\u2225,\n(4) for \u03be \u2208 \u039eout, T1 = \u03b1\u2217\u03be \u25e6 T iff \u03c41 = \u03b1\u2217\u03be(\u03c4),\n(5) \u03c4 is extremal (= pure) iff T is noiseless in the sense of Sect. 4.7,\n(6) \u03c4 is norm continuous under translations, iff T is smoothing in the sense of Sect. 4.4.\nProof. The bijective correspondence is directly from Prop. 24. (1) and (2) are obvious, and (4) follows by noting that under the translations by \u03be stated in that item, the noise function f(\u03b7) = \u27e8\u03c4,W (\u03b7)\u27e9 changes by a factor exp(i\u03be\u00b7\u03b7). (5) is non-trivial, and will be shown in the section mentioned. (6) is trivial from the combination of (4) and (3), noting that smoothing means that \u2225\u03b1\u2217\u03be \u25e6 T \u2212 T \u2225cb \u2192 0 for \u03be \u2192 0. This proves all items except (3).\n(3) Both norms are additive on the positive cone and coincide there. There is then a largest norm on the real linear span of the positive elements with this property, called the base norm [95]. The norm on states is of this type, which implies the inequality. A bit more explicitly, the base norm has the smallest unit ball of all the norms with the given restriction, just the convex hull of the positive and the negative elements of norm one.\n\u2225T1 \u2212 T2\u2225cb \u2264 inf { p+ + p\u2212 \u2223\u2223 T\u00b1 channels, p\u00b1 \u2265 0, (T1 \u2212 T2) = p+T+ \u2212 p\u2212T\u2212} = inf { p+ + p\u2212\n\u2223\u2223 \u03c4\u00b1 states, p\u00b1 \u2265 0, (\u03c41 \u2212 \u03c42) = p+\u03c4+ \u2212 p\u2212\u03c4\u2212} = \u2225\u03c41 \u2212 \u03c42\u2225. (77)\nThis proves the inequality \u201c\u2264\u201d in (3). For the reverse inequality, consider the Weyl operators\nW\u0303 (\u03be) = Wout(\u03be) \u2297W in(S\u03be) (\u03be \u2208 \u039eout) (78)\nfor an extended system (\u039eout, \u03c3out) \u2295 (\u039ein, \u03c3in), where, as in Sect. 2.9, the overline is a complex conjugation inverting the symplectic form. Then W\u0303 is a strongly continuous representation of the\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-04, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 37\nrelations for (\u03beout,\u2206\u03c3). Thus, using the notation (22), for any h \u2208 L1(\u039eout), we have \u2225W\u0303 [h]\u2225 \u2264 \u2225W\u0303\u2206[h]\u2225, because the right hand side is the supremum over all such representations. In the sequel h \u2208 L1(\u039eout) will be chosen with the only constraint that this norm is \u2264 1. Then\n(T \u2217 \u2297 id)(W\u0303 [h]) = \u222b d\u03be h(\u03be) T \u2217 ( Wout(\u03be) ) \u2297W in(S\u03be)\n= \u222b d\u03be h(\u03be)f(\u03be) ( Win(S\u03be) ) \u2297W in(S\u03be)\nWe now apply the squeezed state \u03c9\u03b5 from Lemma 9 for (\u039ein, \u03c3in):\u2329 \u03c9\u03b5, (T \u2217 \u2297 id)(W\u0303 [h]) \u232a = \u222b d\u03be h(\u03be)f(\u03be) \u2329 \u03c9\u03b5, ( Win(S\u03be) ) \u2297W in(S\u03be) \u232a .\nThen, as \u03b5 \u2192 0, the expectation under the integral goes pointwise to 1, so by dominated convergence\nlim \u03b5\u21920\n\u2329 \u03c9\u03b5, (T \u2217 \u2297 id)(W\u0303 [h]) \u232a = \u222b d\u03be h(\u03be)f(\u03be) = \u27e8\u03c4,W\u2206[h]\u27e9.\nNow the left hand side of this equation is linear in T \u2217 and the right hand side is linear in \u03c4 . Plugging in a difference, and observing \u2225W\u0303 [h]\u2225 \u2264 1 and \u2225\u03c9\u03b5\u2225 \u2264 1, we get\u2223\u2223\u2329\u03c41 \u2212 \u03c42,W\u2206[h]\u232a\u2223\u2223 \u2264 \u2225T1 \u2212 T2\u2225cb. The result then follows, because \u2225\u03c41 \u2212 \u03c42\u2225 is the supremum over all h with the required norm bound.\n4.3 Heisenberg pictures for S-covariant channels The Heisenberg picture T \u2217 of a quasifree channel is initially defined on the bidual C\u2217(\u039eout, \u03c3out)\u2217\u2217. However, it also maps better-behaved algebras into each other, so one can settle for one of these algebras as the basic observables in some context. Since the definitions given in Sect. 3 work for arbitrary C*-algebras, commutative, quantum, or hybrid, the analytic properties defining these more special algebras are automatically preserved for all quasifree channels. As remarked already after Lem. 12 each inclusion T \u2217A \u2282 B can also be read as a continuity condition for T .\nProposition 26. For (\u039e, \u03c3) = (\u039ein, \u03c3in) or (\u039e, \u03c3) = (\u039eout, \u03c3out) consider the algebras\nCCR(\u039e, \u03c3) \u2282 Cu(\u039e, \u03c3) \u2282 M(\u039e, \u03c3) \u2282 U(\u039e, \u03c3) \u2282 C\u2217(\u039e, \u03c3)\u2217\u2217. (79)\nLet T \u2217 be the Banach space adjoint of a quasifree channel T : C\u2217(\u039ein, \u03c3in)\u2217 \u2192 C\u2217(\u039eout, \u03c3out)\u2217. Then T \u2217 maps the \u201cout\u201d version of an algebra in this inclusion chain to the corresponding \u201cin\u201d version.\nProof. T \u2217 is initially defined on the bidual, i.e., the largest element in the chain, so for this one, there is nothing to prove. For U(\u039e, \u03c3) and M(\u039e, \u03c3) we have shown the claim in Lem. 12. The other cases use the quasifree structure. For CCR(\u039e, \u03c3) it is obvious from Prop. 24. For Cu(\u039e, \u03c3), as defined in (66), it follows from the observation that if \u03be 7\u2192 \u03b1out\u03be (F ) is norm continuous for some F \u2208 U(\u039eout, \u03c3out), then\n\u03be 7\u2192 S\u22a4\u03be 7\u2192 \u03b1outS\u22a4\u03be(F ) 7\u2192 T \u2217 \u25e6 \u03b1outS\u22a4\u03be(F ) = \u03b1 in \u03be \u25e6 T \u2217(F ) (80)\nis also continuous.\nThe algebra C\u2217(\u039e, \u03c3) is conspicuously absent from the proposition\u2019s list of algebras with an automatic Heisenberg picture. Indeed, it does not belong on that list. A simple counterexample is a depolarizing channel, for which S = 0, and f = \u03c70 is the characteristic function of some output state \u03c90. Then, after (73), \u03c7out = \u03c70 for all input states. This translates to the Heisenberg picture as T (A) = \u03c90(A)1I. So even if A \u2208 C\u2217(\u039eout, \u03c3out) its image under the Heisenberg picture channel map is a multiple of the identity /\u2208 C\u2217(\u039ein, \u03c3in). Nevertheless, there is an easily checkable condition that will ensure the Heisenberg picture also in this case:\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-04, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 38\nLemma 27. Let T be an S-covariant channel. Then either\n(1) S\u039eout = \u039ein and T \u2217 C\u2217(\u039eout, \u03c3out) \u2282 C\u2217(\u039ein, \u03c3in), or (2) S\u039eout \u0338= \u039ein and ( T \u2217 C\u2217(\u039eout, \u03c3out) ) \u2229 C\u2217(\u039ein, \u03c3in) = {0}.\nProof. (1) Take an element W [h] = \u222b d\u03be h(\u03be)W (\u03be) \u2208 C\u2217(\u039eout, \u03c3out). By definition of the algebra C\u2217(\u039eout, \u03c3out) as the C*-envelope of the twisted convolution algebra, such elements are dense. It, therefore, suffices to show that the image under the channel is again given by such an integral. Applying the channel gives\nT \u2217W [h] = \u222b d\u03be h(\u03be)f(\u03be)W (S\u03be). (81)\nWe can split the integration variables into \u03be = (\u03be\u22a5, \u03be\u2225) with S\u03be\u22a5 = 0, and a variable \u03be\u2225 in a suitable linear complement of the kernel. Then \u03be\u2225 uniquely specifies a point S\u03be\u2225 = \u03b7 \u2208 \u039ein. Carrying out the integral over \u03be\u22a5 leaves T \u2217W [h] = W [h\u2032] with a function h\u2032(\u03b7) = \u222b d\u03be\u22a5 h(\u03be\u22a5, \u03be\u2225)f(\u03be\u22a5, \u03be\u2225) which clearly lies in L1(\u039ein, d\u03b7). (2) When S is not surjective, there is a non-zero vector \u03b7 orthogonal to S\u039eout. Then we have \u03b1\u03b7(W (S\u03be)) = exp(i\u03b7\u00b7S\u03be)W (S\u03be) = W (S\u03be) for all \u03be. Integrating with an arbitrary h \u2208 L1(\u039eout), it follows that\n\u03b1\u03b7 \u25e6 T \u2217W [h] = \u222b d\u03be h(\u03be)f(\u03be)\u03b1\u03b7(W (S\u03be)) = T \u2217W [h]. (82)\nThis transfers to C\u2217(\u039eout, \u03c3out) by continuity. The image therefore consists of F \u2208 Cu(\u039ein, \u03c3in) satisfying \u03b1\u03b7F = F . We will show that together with F \u2208 C\u2217(\u039ein, \u03c3in) this implies F = 0. With (63), the action of translations on functions F \u2208 Cu(\u039ein, \u03c3in) is given by(\n\u03b1\u03b7F ) (\u03be0) = W (\u03c3\u03b7)\u2217F (\u03be0 + \u03b70)W (\u03c3\u03b7) = F (\u03be0), (83)\nwhere the last equality expresses our first conclusion. We take the norm on both sides so that the non-zero vector \u03b7 enters only through its classical part \u03b70. We claim that this classical part must vanish. Indeed, the sequence n 7\u2192 \u03be0 + n\u03b70 goes to infinity for all \u03be0, and since F \u2208 C\u2217(\u039ein, \u03c3in) \u223c= K(H1) \u2297 C0(\u039e0) by Prop. 6, we have limn \u2225F (\u03be0 + n\u03b70)\u2225 = 0. But then F (\u03be0) = 0 for all \u03be0, and F = 0. Hence \u03b70 = 0.\nNow, for any fixed \u03be0 (83) says that the (supposedly) compact operator F (\u03be0) commutes with a one-parameter subgroup of Weyl operators. In particular, the finite-dimensional eigenspaces of F (\u03be0) + F (\u03be0)\u2217 would have to be invariant under such a group. But since the generators in the Schr\u00f6dinger representation have a continuous spectrum, this is impossible. So the eigenspaces for non-zero eigenvalues have to be empty, which implies F (\u03be0)+F (\u03be0)\u2217 = 0. Repeating this argument for i(F (\u03be0) \u2212 F (\u03be0)\u2217) we get F (\u03be0) = 0 for all \u03be0, hence F = 0.\nIt may also be advantageous to single out a translation-invariant subspace of Cu(\u039e, \u03c3). The selection may even be done uniformly for all \u039e so that another instance of an \u201cautomatic Heisenberg picture\u201d results. Rather than expanding this theory, let us give an example.\nExample 28. The resolvent algebra. \u25b7 Let us consider the resolvent algebras defined in [28, 58] from the point of view of the present paper, particularly the correspondence theory of Prop. 21. In contrast to the cited works we thus restrict to finite-dimensional \u039e. By definition, the resolvent algebra R(\u039e, \u03c3) is the C*-algebra generated by the resolvent elements (u1I \u2212 \u2211 i \u03beiRi)\u22121, where the Ri are the field operators from (3), and u \u2208 C with \u2111mu \u0338= 0. Let us first consider the C*-algebra generated by the resolvents with one fixed \u03be. Now the functions t 7\u2192 1/(u + t) generate the C*-algebra C0(R) by the StoneWeierstra\u00df Theorem, but, by the resolvent equation, it actually suffices to take the linear span of these functions. Moreover, this space is \u03b1-translation invariant, since\n\u03b1\u03b7\n(( u1I \u2212 \u2211 i \u03beRi ) )\u22121 ) = ( (u\u2212 \u03be\u00b7\u03b7)1I \u2212 \u2211 i \u03beRi )\u22121 . (84)\nHence the resolvents are constant in the direction of the subspace M = \u03be\u22a5 := {\u03b7|\u03be\u00b7\u03b7 = 0} and go to zero transversally to this subspace.\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-04, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 39\nMore generally, we define, for any linear subspace M \u2282 \u039e:\nC0(\u039e/M, \u03c3) = {A \u2208 Cu(\u039e, \u03c3) | \u03b1\u03be(A) = A for \u03be \u2208 M, and w\u2217\u2212lim\n\u03be \u03b1\u03be(A) = 0 for \u03be +M \u2192 \u221e}. (85)\nHere the limit condition just means that for fixed \u03c9 \u2208 C\u2217(\u039e, \u03c3)\u2217, |\u27e8\u03c9, \u03b1x(A)\u27e9| becomes arbitrarily small as soon as \u03be is outside a cylinder, which is infinite in the M -directions and compact transverse to it. One easily checks that these spaces are corresponding in the sense of Prop. 21. Moreover, it is clear that with decreasing M these algebras interpolate between C0(\u039e/\u039e, \u03c3) = C1I and C0(\u039e, \u03c3), and that products are evaluated according to C0(\u039e/M1, \u03c3)C0(\u039e/M2, \u03c3) = C0(\u039e/(M1 \u2229 M2), \u03c3). Hence\nR(\u039e, \u03c3) = \u2211 M C0(\u039e/M, \u03c3). (86)\nIn the specific sense of Prop. 21, R(\u039e, \u03c3) is independent of \u03c3. It hence suffices to check in the classical case (\u03c3 = 0) that it is closed under noiseless channels and tensor product expansions (see Sect. 4.8), and hence under arbitrary quasifree channels.\nIt would be interesting to get the exact relationship between the above analysis, which is manifestly independent of \u03c3, and the one in [28], which focuses particularly on the non-degenerate subspaces M \u2282 \u039e, i.e., the subspaces on which \u03c3 is symplectic. \u25c1"

The resulting structure also supports other Lp spaces and corresponding Schatten classes (Sect. 2.8). A natural question is then whether a given quasifree channel preserves the continuity of states and therefore can be seen as a normal map between the corresponding hybrid von Neumann algebras L\u221e(\u039e, \u03c3) as defined in (39). The identity channel obviously has this property, but, for example, a depolarizing channel with a pure output state does not. The following lemma gives a positive answer for general nonsingular S and arbitrary noise function. Because all St in a matrix semigroup are non-singular, we conclude that the von Neumann algebra L\u221e(\u039e, \u03c3), as used in [35], is a sufficient arena for quasifree semigroups.\nLemma 29. Let T be the quasifree channel given by S : \u039eout \u2192 \u039ein and f : \u039eout \u2192 C. Suppose that S is injective. Then T maps norm continuous states to norm continuous states.\nProof. When S is injective, S\u22a4\u039ein \u2192 \u039eout is surjective. So let \u03be \u2208 \u039eout, which we can consequently write as \u03be = S\u22a4\u03b7. Suppose that \u03c1in is norm continuous under translations, and consider \u03c1out = T \u03c1in. Then by (70) the function t 7\u2192 \u03b1\u2217t\u03be(\u03c1out) = \u03b1\u2217tS\u22a4\u03b7 \u25e6 T (\u03c1)in = T ( \u03b1\u2217t\u03b7(\u03c1in) ) is continuous in norm.

For that we need sufficient noise, and the following proposition collects some basic observations.\nProposition 30. Let T be a quasifree channel with noise state \u03c4 and noise function f . Consider the following statements:\n(1) f \u2208 Lp(\u039e, d\u03be) for some p \u2208 [1, 2].\n(2) \u03c4 is norm continuous under translations.\n(3) lim\u03be\u21920 \u2225\u03b1\u2217\u03be \u25e6 T \u2212 T \u2225cb = 0.\n(4) For all \u03c9 \u2208 C\u2217(\u039ein, \u03c3in)\u2217, T \u03c9 is norm continuous under translations.\n(5) For all A \u2208 U(\u039eout, \u03c3out), T \u2217A \u2208 Cu(\u039ein, \u03c3in).\nThen (1)\u21d2(2)\u21d2(3)\u21d2(4) and (5). A channel with the property (3) will be called smoothing.\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-04, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 40\nProof. (1)\u21d2(2) is a part of Prop. 7 applied to the noise state. (2)\u21d2(3) is an immediate consequence of items (3) and (4) of Cor. 25, which also proves item (6) of that corollary. The remaining items follow from (3) by applying T or T \u2217 to the respective arguments. For (3)\u21d2(5) note Prop. 26 and Cor. 15.\nFor a converse at this point one would need a uniformity condition on the modulus of continuity: For example, demanding the existence of an \u03c9-independent function \u03b5(\u03be), which goes to zero as \u03be \u2192 0, and satisfies \u2225\u03c9 \u2212 (\u03b1\u2217\u03be \u25e6 T ) \u2297 idn\u03c9\u2225 \u2264 \u03b5(\u03be) for all states on C\u2217(\u039ein, \u03c3in) \u2297 Mn is equivalent to (3).\nThe term smoothing also suggests higher orders, and indeed the idea can be applied immediately to differentiability conditions. If f is a Schwartz function, or even a Gaussian, as in most applications, \u03b1\u2217\u03be(\u03c4) has Taylor approximations of all orders, where the coefficients are in C\u2217(\u039eout,\u2206\u03c3), and the error terms are likewise bounded in norm. This then transfers directly to \u03b1\u2217\u03be \u25e6 T as well as all channel outputs."

            "text": "Squeezing is an important operation in quantum optics. It did not show up so far because we treated systems with the same number of quantum and classical degrees of freedom as equivalent. In quantum optics, however, there is an additional structure, the free time evolution/Hamiltonian. Closely related is the vacuum state, the unique ground state of the Hamiltonian. A compact way to encode it is to specify a complex structure on \u039e, i.e., a symplectic real-linear operator I : \u039e \u2192 \u039e so that I2 = \u22121I, and \u27e8\u03be, \u03b7\u27e9 = ( \u03be\u00b7\u03c3I\u03b7 + i\u03be\u00b7\u03c3\u03b7 ) /2 turns \u039e into an n-dimensional complex Hilbert space, in which multiplication by the scalar i is interpreted as the operator I. The characteristic function of the vacuum is then \u03c7(\u03be) = exp ( \u2212\u27e8\u03be, \u03be\u27e9/2 ) . Very often this structure is assumed from the outset, i.e., the phase space \u039e is taken to be a Hilbert space, and the symplectic form is the imaginary part of the scalar product.\nLet us denote by \u03b3t the quasifree channel with St = exp(It) = (cos t)1I + (sin t)I and f(\u03be) \u2261 1, which is also called the group of gauge transformations. In the hybrid case, we extend it by St = 1I on the classical variables. In the Schr\u00f6dinger representation of the quantum part, this is a unitarily implemented group generated by the number operator. This gives the Schr\u00f6dinger representation a Fock space structure with the Hilbert space \u039e as the one particle space and a decomposition of the canonical operators Rk into a creation and an annihilation part.\nOur main reason for reiterating these well-known facts here is to avoid potential confusion about the term \u201clinear\u201d. In the language of (quantum) optics, linear elements are beam splitters, phase shifters, and other passive dielectric components of an optical setup. They are indeed quasifree operations, i.e., described in terms of symplectic linear operations on phase space, but in addition, they commute with the free time evolution, i.e., they intertwine the respective complex structures Iin and Iout: They are complex linear. Usually, this is applied to unitary channels only, but it is natural to demand that the noise function be gauge invariant as well. So we define a gauge invariant channel between phase spaces with complex structure as one with \u03b3outt T = T \u03b3int . This applies to states, as well, whereby gauge-invariant states are just those commuting with the number operator. For a channel it is somewhat weaker than particle number conservation: A damping channel (S = e\u2212\u03bbt1I, f(\u03be) = exp(\u2212(1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03bbt)\u2225\u03be\u22252/2)) is gauge invariant, but reduces particle number. Some of the interesting hybrid channels, e.g., position observables, are not gauge invariant.\nSqueezing components are just those that are not gauge invariant, such as the preparation of a (perhaps Gaussian) state with different variances for P and Q, or in quantum optics for the field quadratures. In order to achieve a certain task, for example, the preparation of an entangled state of two modes from a laser, it may be necessary to use squeezing elements. The framework for quantifying just how much squeezing is required (not counting any gauge invariant intermediate steps) is called the resource theory of squeezing [96, 97]. It would carry us too far to include a systematic presentation here. A key element is the singular value decomposition, here also called the Bloch\u2013Messiah decomposition [96], S = S1S2S3 with S1, S3 orthogonal symplectic (nonsqueezing) and S2 purely squeezing, i.e., multiplication with a positive factor in some directions and multiplication with the inverse in the conjugate ones.\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-04, click title to verify.

            "text": "In this section, we briefly consider three ways of combining channels or states. They correspond roughly to the parallel and serial execution of operations and to the addition of phase space variables. For none of these, a case distinction for different configurations of classical and quantum variables is needed.\nComposition of subsystems\nComposition is usually rendered as the tensor product of Hilbert spaces or observable algebras. In our context, this indeed corresponds to C*-tensor products at the level of the non-unital algebras C\u2217(\u039e, \u03c3). Given hybrid phase spaces (\u039ej , \u03c3j) with indices j = 1, 2, their composition is the hybrid phase space (\u039e12, \u03c312) = (\u039e1 \u2295 \u039e2, \u03c31 \u2295 \u03c32). The C*-tensor product C\u2217(\u039e12, \u03c312) = C\u2217(\u039e1, \u03c31) \u2297 C\u2217(\u039e2, \u03c32) is uniquely defined, because the algebras involved are nuclear, so maximal and minimal C*-norm [14] on the algebraic tensor product coincide. This entails that states in C\u2217(\u039e12, \u03c312)\u2217 can be weakly approximated by product elements, but the resulting \u201ctensor product of state spaces\u201d requires more than norm limits of product elements. For observable algebras a simple approach using norm limits also fails (cf. Sect. 3.4). It is clear that the compactification of a product is usually not the product of the compactifications. Even for the one-point compactification, corresponding to the observable algebras Ai = C\u2217(\u039ei, \u03c3i) \u2295C1I, we get additional components, like 1I \u2297 C\u2217(\u039e2, \u03c32) \u0338\u2282 C\u2217(\u039e12, \u03c312) \u2295 C1I.\nIn spite of these subtleties, quasifree channels allow a straightforward composition operation T1 \u2297 T2. When Si : \u039ei,out \u2192 \u039ei,in and fi : \u039ei,out \u2192 C are the data defining Ti, the tensor product has\nS(\u03be1 \u2295 \u03be2) = (S1\u03be1) \u2295 (S2\u03be2), f(\u03be1 \u2295 \u03be2) = f1(\u03be1)f2(\u03be2).\n(87)\nOf course, with the composition of quantum systems comes entanglement. It is the observation that, while general states on a composite system can be approximated by product elements, these product elements cannot be taken to be positive. Indeed, non-entangled or \u201cseparable\u201d states are nowadays defined by the existence of a positive product approximation [98, 99]. Entanglement in Gaussian states is well understood [25, 100, 101, 102, 103], but the hybrid scenario creates no new interesting possibilities: The classical part of a composite hybrid is just the product of the classical parts. The pure classical states are point measures on a cartesian product, and hence product states. This is just saying that classical systems cannot be entangled. In the integral decomposition (13) of an arbitrary hybrid state, all entanglement is therefore in the states \u03c1x, where x = (x1, x2) is a point in the cartesian product.\nThis is true in spite of the recent proposal [49] to use entanglement generation via a classical intermediary in a classical theory of gravity, see Sect. 1.3.\nConcatenation\nExecuting one operation after the other is called, depending on community or context, concatenation, composition or multiplication. We use the first term, which derives from Latin for chaining because the second is too unspecific (see previous paragraph), and the third is too overloaded. Clearly, when T1, T2 are quasifree channels, so is concatenation T = T1T2. When we take S1, S2, S and f1, f2, f as the defining parameters of these channels then\nS = S2S1, f(\u03be) = f1(\u03be)f2(S1\u03be).\n(88)\nWe thus get a category whose objects are the hybrid systems and whose morphisms are the quasifree channels. Objects in a category are \u201cthe same\u201d if they are connected by a morphism and its inverse morphism. Isomorphism classes in our setting are labelled by the pairs (n, s) \u2208 N \u00d7 N, where n is the number of quantum degrees of freedom, so that \u039e1 = R2n as a vector space on which \u03c3 is non-degenerate, and s is the number of classical dimensions, i.e., \u039e0 = ker\u03c3 = Rs. Note that,\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-04, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 42\nin particular, our theory depends only on (\u039e, \u03c3) and not on a particular splitting \u039e = \u039e1 \u2295 \u039e0. We have used such splittings above, although only \u039e0, the null space of \u03c3 is intrinsically defined by the structure (\u039e, \u03c3), and different complements \u039e1 could be chosen. Changing this splitting is an isomorphism leaving \u039e0 fixed. It acts by an \u03be0-dependent phase space translation of the quantum part, which is clearly quasifree and invertible as such.\nOther categorical features (monomorphism, epimorphisms, etc.) can be worked out. An important result of this kind is a characterization of channels with a one-sided inverse, see Prop. 33.\nA trivial but frequently used concatenation is the formation of marginals of a channel, i.e., considering only one of the outputs and discarding the other (see Sect. 5.7 below). The discarding operation is itself a channel, the noiseless one with S : \u039e1 \u2192 \u039e1 \u2295\u039e2, S\u03be1 = \u03be1 \u22950. Equivalently, it is the tensor product of the identity on \u039e1 with the destructive channel defined by \u039eout = {0}, and consequently S : 0 7\u2192 0 \u2208 \u039e2.\nConvolution\nWe have already met the convolution of states in Def. 20. As in all group representation theory, one should think of convolutions as a contravariant encoding of the group multiplication. So it is here: Let us consider two systems with the same set \u039e = \u039e1 = \u039e2, so the addition of phase space elements makes sense. For the moment, we do not care whether they are classical or quantum. Can we add signals of these types? The model for this is the addition of random variables. It corresponds to setting the Fourier arguments dual to the random variables x1 and x2 equal: The characteristic function for a sum is the expectation of exp(ik(x1 + x2)), which we obtain from that of the joint distribution. So convolution in general corresponds to the linear map S\u03be = \u03be\u2295\u03be \u2208 \u039e1 \u2295\u039e2. So this would suggest a channel acting as T (\u03c11 \u2297 \u03c12) = \u03c11 \u2217 \u03c12. This works as a noiseless channel when one of the factors is classical. In the quantum case, however, although the convolution of arbitrary states is well defined, the map T with this property would not extend as a channel to entangled states. Thus one could either add noise or modify the definition by inverting the symplectic form in one factor, i.e., setting T (\u03c11 \u2297 \u03c1\u22a42 ) = \u03c11 \u2217 \u03c12, where \u03c1\u22a4 denotes transposition (= inversion of momenta) or the application of any other antiunitary quasifree symmetry. This idea will be used in our analysis of teleportation (Sect. 5.8)."

In fact, unless the noise measure is concentrated on a single point, and we thus have a simple translation, we have |g(\u03be)| < 1 for some \u03be and the decrease of |f(\u03be)| is strict, at least for some \u03be.\nA channel can thus be called a minimal noise channel if it cannot be constructed in this way with |g| =\u0338 1.

In the same spirit, we call a channel noiseless, if |f(\u03be)| = 1, for all \u03be, i.e., it is as large as consistent with any kind of twisted positive definiteness.

Since f is twisted positive definite, we must have |f(\u03be)| \u2264 1, and by the homomorphism property 1 = |f(\u03be)||f(\u2212\u03be)| so |f(\u03be)| \u2265 1, i.e., |f(\u03be)| = 1. This shows that (3)\u21d2(1). The direction (1)\u21d2(2) follows immediately from Lem. 32 below (see also the remark following the proof).\nIt remains to verify the equivalence (3)\u21d4(4). Here the direction (4)\u21d2(3) is trivial because CCR(\u039e, \u03c3) \u2282 C\u2217(\u039e, \u03c3)\u2217\u2217, and Weyl operators go to Weyl operators (see also the discussion in Sect. 4.3).

Repeating this argument for the first factor extends the relation to all A,B.\nThe following lemma is needed in the proof, and we separated it because it is of independent interest.\nLemma 32. Let (\u039e, \u03c3) be a vector space with antisymmetric form, and suppose that \u03c7 is a normalized \u03c3-twisted positive definite function on \u039e. Suppose that |\u03c7(\u03b7)| = 1 for some \u03b7 \u0338= 0. Then \u03c3\u03b7 = 0 and, for all \u03be \u2208 \u039e,\n\u03c7(\u03be + \u03b7) = \u03c7(\u03be)\u03c7(\u03b7). (90)\nProof.

Then M12 = \u03c7(\u2212\u03b7) = \u03c7(\u03b7), M23 = \u03c7(\u03be), M31 = \u03c7(\u03be + \u03b7) exp(\u2212 i2\u03be\u00b7\u03c3\u03b7). In particular, |M12| = |\u03c7(\u03b7)| = 1, so this expression simplifies to\n0 \u2264 detM = \u2212 \u2223\u2223M31 \u2212M12 M23\u2223\u22232. (93)\nThis can only be positive if the absolute value vanishes, which means that\n\u03c7(\u03be + \u03b7) = \u03c7(\u03be)\u03c7(\u03b7)e i2 \u03be\u00b7\u03c3\u03b7. (94)\nChanging \u03be 7\u2192 \u2212\u03be, and \u03b7 7\u2192 \u2212\u03b7, which also satisfies the assumption of the lemma, every characteristic function in the last expressions changes to its complex conjugate, while the exponent does not. Hence the exponential factor has to be 1. Since \u03be 7\u2192 \u03bb\u03be is also allowed, the exponent has to be zero.\nThis shows that the maximal absolute value of \u03c7 can only be reached on the classical subsystem. We have not assumed that |\u03c7(\u03bb\u03b7)| = 1 also holds for all scalar multiples \u03bb\u03b7 as well. If that is the case, and \u03c7 is continuous, then \u03c7(\u03b7) = exp(i\u00b5\u00b7\u03b7) for some \u00b5 \u2208 \u039e. We remark that this assumption may fail, and so, even in 1 dimension, we cannot conclude from the assumptions of the lemma that \u03c7 is the characteristic function of a point measure. For example, the classical characteristic function of a measure supported by the integers is 2\u03c0-periodic, so \u03c7(2\u03c0) = 1, but except for a point measure we have |\u03c7(\u03b7)| < 1 for 0 < \u03b7 < 2\u03c0.\nLet us recapitulate which of the basic operations are noiseless.\n\u2022 The states with the homomorphism property, i.e. (\u03c9(AB) = \u03c9(A)\u03c9(B)), are only the pure states of classical systems, corresponding to point measures on \u039e = \u039e0. Noiseless quantum states do not exist, which also excludes such states on hybrids with non-vanishing \u03c3.\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-04, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 44\n\u2022 Noiseless observables are the projection valued ones: The homomorphism property implies F (M)2 = T \u2217(\u03c7M )2 = T \u2217(\u03c72M ) = T \u2217(\u03c7M ). When the observable is considered as acting on a function algebra Cb(\u039eout) this is the property of having a von Neumann-style functional calculus, T \u2217(\u03a6(A)) = \u03a6(T \u2217(A)) for \u03a6 : R \u2192 R. That is, postprocessing of outcomes with a function \u03a6 is the same as applying this function to the operator in the functional calculus.\n\u2022 Noiseless channels from an irreducible quantum system to itself act by unitary transformation, where the unitary operator belongs to the metaplectic representation [104] of the affine symplectic group.\nThe following proposition characterizes a further class of noiseless channels, namely those with a right inverse in the Schr\u00f6dinger picture.\nProposition 33. Let T1 : C\u2217(\u039e1, \u03c31)\u2217 \u2192 C\u2217(\u039e2, \u03c32)\u2217 and T2 : C\u2217(\u039e2, \u03c32)\u2217 \u2192 C\u2217(\u039e1, \u03c31)\u2217 be quasifree channels such that T1T2 = id. Then\n(1) T1 is noiseless, and S1 : \u039e2 \u2192 \u039e1 is injective,\n(2) T2 is an expansion, i.e., there is a system (\u039ee, \u03c3e) such that there is an isomorphism\n(\u039e1, \u03c31) \u223c= (\u039e2 \u2295 \u039ee, \u03c32 \u2295 \u03c3e),\nand T2 = id2 \u2297 Pe, where Pe is a preparation of a (\u039ee, \u03c3e)-system,\n(3) under the isomorphism from (2), S1 : \u039e2 \u2192 \u039e2 \u2295\u039ee is the embedding into the first summand.\nMoreover, for i = 1, 2 if a channel Ti satisfies the condition (i), then there is a channel T3\u2212i, so that T1 and T2 satisfy all the above conditions.\nProof. The composition relation (88) gives that 1I = S2S1 and f1(\u03be)f2(S1\u03be) = 1. Since |fi(\u03be)| \u2264 1 by positive definiteness, we must have |f1(\u03be)| = |f2(S1\u03be)| = 1 for all \u03be. In particular, T1 must be noiseless, and since S1 has a left inverse, it is injective. This shows (1).\nNow consider (2). f2 is twisted positive definite for \u2206\u03c3 = \u03c31 \u2212 S\u22a42 \u03c32S2. Moreover, on the subspace S1\u039e1 this function has the maximal modulus, so by Lem. 32 the range of S1 is in the null space of \u2206\u03c3. This is equivalent to the matrix equation (\u2206\u03c3)S1 = 0. Using S2S1 = 1I gives\n\u03c31S1 = S\u22a42 \u03c32. (95)\nSince S1S2 is an idempotent operator, every \u03be \u2208 \u039e1 is naturally split as \u03be = S1S2\u03be + (1I \u2212 S1S2)\u03be, where the first summand is obviously in the range S1\u039e2 and the second satisfies S2(1I \u2212 S1S2)\u03be = (S2 \u2212 S2)\u03be = 0. Therefore, by (95)\u22a4, these parts are \u03c31-orthogonal:\nS1\u03be \u00b7 \u03c31(1I \u2212 S1S2)\u03b7 = \u03be \u00b7 \u03c32S2(1I \u2212 S1S2)\u03b7 = 0. (96)\nMoreover, S1 : \u039e2 \u2192 \u039e1 is an isomorphism onto its range, changing \u03c32 to the restriction of \u03c31. This proves the decomposition with \u039ee = (1I \u2212 S1S2)\u039e1 and \u03c3e the restriction of \u03c31 to this subspace. The action of S2 is very simple in these terms: It acts separately on the two summands, which makes the corresponding channel a tensor product. On the first summand, S1\u039e2, it just inverts the isomorphism S1. Hence, after identifying the 2 subsystem of \u039e1 with \u039e2, it acts like the identity channel on this part. The second summand \u039ee is annihilated by S2, which is the hallmark of a preparation (see above). The state prepared lives on (\u039ee, \u03c3e) and has characteristic function \u03c7e(\u03bee) = f2(\u03bee)."

All these variations have the structure of factorizations through an intermediate system, B(K). The first step (in the direction from input to output) is the embedding of the input states in Hin into this \u201clarger system\u201d, an expansion. The second step, done here by the representation \u03c0, is a noiseless operation in the sense of the previous paragraph. These features can be phrased entirely in the category of quasifree maps. What is more, the factorization can be done for arbitrary quasifree channels. This is the content of Thm. 34. We will discuss later how it relates to Stinespring-like results.\nNote that the channels are written here in the Schr\u00f6dinger picture, so in the factorization T = TN TE , the expansion TE is applied to the physical system first, and TN acts on the expanded system. If we write the expansion channel as tensoring with a fixed state \u03c9E , the factorization is written as\nT \u03c9 = TN (\u03c9 \u2297 \u03c9E). (98)\nTheorem 34. Every quasifree channel can be decomposed into T = TN TE, where TE is an expansion and TN is a noiseless channel. The phase space of the extension system is \u039e\u2206 = \u039eout as a vector space, but with antisymmetric form \u2206\u03c3 = \u03c3out \u2212 S\u22a4\u03c3inS. The salient linear maps and noise functions are\nSN : \u039eout \u2192 \u039ein \u2295 \u039e\u2206 SN\u03be = S\u03be \u2295 \u03be fN (\u03be) = 1 SE : \u039ein \u2295 \u039e\u2206 \u2192 \u039ein SE(\u03be1 \u2295 \u03be2) = \u03be1 fE(\u03be1 \u2295 \u03be2) = f(\u03be2).\n(99)\nProof. Let us first verify that the given data for TN and TE satisfy the positivity condition for channels. The respective difference forms are\n\u03be\u00b7(\u2206\u03c3)N\u03b7 = \u03be\u00b7\u03c3out\u03b7 \u2212 (SN\u03be)\u00b7(\u03c3in \u2295 \u03c3\u2206)SN\u03b7 = \u03be\u00b7\u03c3out\u03b7 \u2212 (S\u03be)\u00b7\u03c3inS\u03b7 \u2212 \u03be\u00b7\u03c3\u2206\u03b7 = 0 (100)\n(\u03be1 \u2295 \u03be2)\u00b7(\u2206\u03c3)E(\u03b71 \u2295 \u03b72) = (\u03be1 \u2295 \u03be2)\u00b7(\u03c3in \u2295 \u03c3\u2206)(\u03b71 \u2295 \u03b72) \u2212 SE(\u03be1 \u2295 \u03be2)\u00b7\u03c3inSE(\u03b71 \u2295 \u03b72) = \u03be1\u00b7\u03c3in\u03b71 + \u03be2\u00b7\u03c3\u2206\u03b72 \u2212 \u03be1\u00b7\u03c3in\u03b71 = \u03be2\u00b7\u03c3\u2206\u03b72. (101)\nHence (\u2206\u03c3)N = 0, as required of a noiseless channel, which makes f = 1 a legitimate choice. Moreover, (\u2206\u03c3)E = (0 \u2295 \u03c3\u2206), which is exactly the noise function for which fE has to be twisted positive definite. Hence TN and TE are well defined.\nIt remains to verify the concatenation relation. Of course, the product of two channels in our class is again in the class, and there is a simple general formula for the data (S\u2032, f \u2032) of the product. By (88), this gives\nS\u2032 = SESN = S and f \u2032(\u03be) = fE(SN\u03be)fN (\u03be) = f(\u03be). (102)\nHence we have TN TE = T , as claimed.\nWhen only one fixed channel T is under consideration, the above representation may be very wasteful. For example, when T is itself noiseless, one can clearly choose TE to be the identity, and there is no need to adjoin an additional system \u039e\u2206, i.e., (99) is not a \u201cminimal\u201d factorization. In order to move towards minimality, for a general quasifree channel, consider the noise function f : \u039eout \u2192 C. Let N \u2282 \u039e\u2206 denote the largest subspace on which |f(\u03be)| = 1. Then by Lem. 32, f is a character on N , and hence of the form f1(\u03be) = exp(i\u03bb\u00b7\u03be) for some \u03bb \u2208 \u039eout. Here \u03bb is not uniquely determined, because only the scalar products \u03bb\u00b7\u03be with \u03be \u2208 N appear, but any choice allows us to proceed. The remainder f \u2032(\u03be) = f(\u03be)/f1(\u03be) is then a legitimate noise function with f \u2032(\u03b7 + \u03be) = f \u2032(\u03b7) for \u03be \u2208 N . We may therefore consider f \u2032 as a function fmid on the quotient \u039emid = \u039eout/N . Denoting the quotient map by Smid : \u039eout \u2192 \u039emid, this amounts to f(\u03be) = f1(\u03be)fmid(Smid\u03be). By Lem. 32, N is also contained in the null space of \u2206\u03c3, so this form also passes to the quotient as \u03c3mid. This gives an alternative noise factorization T = TN TE , closely related to (99), but with the intermediate system (\u039e\u2206,\u2206\u03c3) replaced by (\u039emid, \u03c3mid),\nSN : \u039eout \u2192 \u039ein \u2295 \u039emid SN\u03be = S\u03be \u2295 Smid\u03be f1(\u03be) = exp(i\u03bb\u00b7\u03be) SE : \u039ein \u2295 \u039emid \u2192 \u039ein SE(\u03be1 \u2295 \u03be2) = \u03be1 fE(\u03be1 \u2295 \u03be2) = fmid(\u03be2).\n(103)\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-04, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 46\nThe map SN in this construction is connected to the previous one by another noiseless channel based on the quotient map Smid. That is, the modification just described moves in the direction of including as much of the channel into the noiseless part as possible. This follows a categorical approach described in [105] as the Paschke dilation. This generalizes the Stinespring construction to the category of W*-algebras with normal completely positive maps, when the range in the Heisenberg picture (corresponding to the input in physical terms) is no longer of the form B(H). Fig. 4 summarizes the defining minimality condition.\nA Paschke dilation, or a factorization T = TN TE can be turned into a Stinespring dilation in the usual sense by taking the input algebra as faithfully represented on a Hilbert space H, so in the Heisenberg picture the channel maps into B(H), and hence we realize the standard setting for the Stinespring construction. This step hardly depends on the hybrid structure: We will only use that TE is an expansion, and TN is a *-homomorphism. As seen from the \u00b5-free setting, this requires the choice of some measure \u00b5 on the classical part of the input phase space. Then H = H\u00b5 = H1 \u2297 L2(\u039ein,0, \u00b5) is the space of a standard representation (see Sect. 2.2), and the input von Neumann algebra is Ain = B(H1)\u2297L\u221e(\u039ein,0, \u00b5) \u2282 B(H\u00b5). On the output side, we define the von Neumann algebra Aout as the weak closure of the GNS representation of an output state \u03c9out = T \u03c9in, when \u03c9in is a suitable faithful input state. The expansion state is some normal state \u03c9E on a von Neumann algebra AE . Thus TE\u03c1 = \u03c1\u2297\u03c9E , a state on Ain \u2297AE , and the factorization uses some normal *-homomorphism T \u2217N : Aout \u2192 Ain\u2297AE . Now, let (HE , \u03c0E ,\u2126E) denote the GNS-representation of the expansion state. Then we define\nV : H \u2192 H \u2297 HE , with V \u03d5 = \u03d5\u2297 \u2126E , \u03c0 : Aout \u2192 B(H \u2297 HE), with \u03c0 = (id \u2297 \u03c0E)T \u2217.\n(104)\nThen V \u2217(id\u2297\u03c0E)(A\u2297B)V = \u03c9E(B)A = TE(A\u2297B), and composing that with T \u2217N we get T \u2217(X) = T \u2217E T \u2217N (X) = V \u2217(id\u2297\u03c0E)(T \u2217N (X))V = V \u2217\u03c0(X)V . Hence, (104) defines a Stinespring dilation, which is, however, usually not the unique minimal one. Of course, the minimal representation is contained in this by choosing an appropriate subspace of H\u00b5 \u2297 HE and restricting \u03c0 accordingly. Since that depends on further details of the channels involved, we will not pursue this here."

The theory laid out in Sect. 3 shows that the two ways of looking at an observable, namely as a positive operator-valued measure (POVM) on the one hand and as an operator on continuous functions on the other, are equivalent Heisenberg pictures of such a channel. For the POVM view, we have to identify, for every measurable set M \u2282 \u039eout, an effect operator F (M) on the input system. Thus we need a Heisenberg picture map T \u2217 which is well defined on the indicator function 1M \u2208 U(\u039eout, 0). The appropriate Heisenberg picture is thus T \u2217 : U(\u039eout, 0) \u2192 U(\u039ein, \u03c3in), and the positive operator-valued measure describing the observable is F (M) = T \u2217(1M ).

In this traditional subject, [110, 53], the basic construction of all covariant observables uses a covariant version [111] of the Stinespring dilation (called Naimark\u2019s dilation for the case of classical output) to reduce the construction to the noiseless, i.e., projection valued case, which is then solved by Mackey\u2019s theory of induced representations (see [112], and [113] for a worked example). What has apparently not been considered in detail was the nature of the noise. In our framework, there is a clear distinction of the position vs. the phase space case, requiring classical vs. quantum noise. We, therefore, treat these cases separately below.\nA traditional subject in the general theory is the existence of a direct formula for the output probability density at a point in the outcome set. If such a formula exists, it will be given by the expectation value of a positive possibly unbounded operator, which is called the operator-valued Radon\u2013Nikodym density of the observable (see e.g., [53, Sect. IV.2.], [114, Sect. I.5.G], and [110, Thm. 4.5.2] for the compact group case). That is, we are looking for a family of positive, possibly unbounded operators F\u0307 (x) such that the observable is expressed as\nT \u2217(g) = \u222b dx F\u0307 (x) g(x). (106)\nRecall that, following (5), our convention for the action of translations is (\u03b1xg)(y) = g(x+ y). So the covariance condition (70) translates to \u03b1\u03be ( F\u0307 (x) ) = F\u0307 (x\u2212 S\u22a4\u03be). Now since S is injective, S\u22a4 is onto, so this equation determines the function F\u0307 (x) from one of the values, say F\u0307 (0) =: F\u0307 :\nF\u0307 (x) = \u03b1\u2212\u03be(F\u0307 ), for any \u03be \u2208 \u039ein such that S\u22a4\u03be = x. (107)\nSince S\u22a4 might have a kernel, this also implies the invariance of F\u0307 under \u03b1\u03be with S\u22a4\u03be = 0. Of course, there is also an expression for F\u0307 in terms of the noise function f , since both quantities determine the observable. For that we put g(x) = exp(ik\u00b7x), i.e., g = Wout(k), in the above equation, and solve for F\u0307 by inverse Fourier transform. With n = dim \u039eout we get:\nF\u0307 = 1(2\u03c0)n\n\u222b dkf(k)Win(Sk). (108)\nIn general, e.g., for the canonical position observable, neither F\u0307 nor this integral makes sense. However, with sufficient noise, seen by the decay of f at infinity, both do.\nPosition observables\nThe canonical position observable of a purely quantum system belongs to the selfadjoint operators Qj from Sect. 2.1. The characteristic function of the output probability distribution is hence the expectation of exp(ik \u00b7Q) = W (k, 0). So this is quasifree with \u039eout = {k} = Rn and\nSk = (k, 0), (109)\nwhen the variables are arranged as described in Sect. 2.1. Of course, one could also include some classical hybrid variables. Since the noise function vanishes, the observable is projection valued, which can be said in two equivalent ways, namely that F (M) is always a projection or that T \u2217 is a homomorphism (also compare Prop. 31). For any input density operator \u03c1, we write T \u03c1 = \u03c1Q, and call it the position distribution of \u03c1. Similarly, we define \u03c1P as the momentum distribution.\nThe beauty of the quasifree formalism is here that it automatically includes noisy versions. These are characterized by choosing the same S, but allowing f to be more general. This defines the class of generalized position observables, which share the covariance condition with the canonical one. The structure theory is then immediate: Since \u2206\u03c3 = 0 the noise is necessarily classical, so the most general position observable has the output distribution \u03bd \u2217 \u03c1Q, where \u03bd is some fixed noise measure on position space which is independent of \u03c1, and \u03c1Q is the output distribution of the\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-04, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 49\nstandard position observable. Thus we can always think of such a measurement as executing the standard one and then adding, from a statistically independent source, noise with distribution \u03bd.\nWhen the noise distribution has a Radon\u2013Nikodym density \u03bd\u0307 with respect to the Lebesgue measure, we have F\u0307 = \u03bd\u0307(Q) in the functional calculus of the commuting selfadjoint operators Qk. In contrast, for the canonical observable itself, the expectation of F\u0307 in the state vector \u03a8 should be |\u03a8(x)|2, which might be given a meaning as a sesquilinear form on Schwartz space. But there is no closable operator F\u0307 corresponding to this. This is also seen in the difficulty of making sense of (108).\nPhase space observables\nHere we demand a joint measurement of all positions and momenta. So we have \u039eout = \u039ein and S = 1I, but the symplectic forms are different, namely the standard quantum one on \u039ein and 0 on \u039eout. Hence, \u2206\u03c3 = \u2212\u03c3in, and the admissible noise functions are exactly the characteristic functions of quantum states \u03c4 . Hence the relation (73) is exactly that for a convolution of quantum states in the sense of [27] and Def. 20. When \u03c4 is the quantum state defining the observable, and \u03c1 is the input state, the output distribution is thus \u03c4 \u2217 \u03c1. Comparing the expression (69) with (106) we find the Radon\u2013Nikodym density of the POVM to be\nF\u0307 = \u03b2\u2212(\u03c4). (110)\nThis is a density operator in two different meanings of the word: A Radon\u2013Nikodym density, and also a positive operator with trace 1, provided the correct normalization of phase space Lebesgue measure (cf. [27]) is used. This characterization of covariant phase space observables is well-known [110, 27, 53]. The Gaussian special case is known in quantum optics as the Husimi distribution or Q-function of \u03c1. But as the quasifree formalism clearly indicates, any \u03c4 , pure or mixed, will work analogously.\nOf course, such a joint position/momentum measurement necessarily includes errors, which is the subject of measurement uncertainty relations [115]. By this, we mean any relation expressing that one can either get a fairly good position measurement with large errors for momenta or conversely. For uncertainty relations, the covariance condition is an unwanted restriction, but the proof of the general case [115] works via showing that among the optimal solutions, there is always a covariant one. This makes the tradeoffs extremely easy to describe. Indeed, the position marginal of the output distribution is (\u03c4 \u2217 \u03c1)Q = \u03c4Q \u2217 \u03c1Q, a relation which is shown by setting one set of variables equal to zero in the product of characteristic functions of \u03c4 and \u03c1. In other words, the position marginal of phase space observable is a noisy position observable. That statement is obvious from the covariance conditions, but here we also learn that the noise measure is itself the position distribution \u03c4Q of a quantum state \u03c4 . The same holds for momentum, and, crucially, it is the same quantum state \u03c4 that enters. In other words, the tradeoff between the noises in the marginals of a phase space observable is the same as the tradeoff between the concentration of the position distribution \u03c4Q and the momentum distribution \u03c4P of a quantum state. This tradeoff is known as preparation uncertainty. The equality of measurement uncertainty and preparation uncertainty is false for most other observable pairs but persists [116] for more general observable pairs, which are related by the Fourier transformation of some locally compact abelian group. This includes angle and number, or qubit strings looked at in different Pauli bases."

Actually, this conclusion is valid even without the quasifree form, just using that equality in the Schwarz inequality for completely positive maps (T (x\u2217x) \u2265 T (x)\u2217T (x)) implies the homomorphism property. Hence for a reversible evolution, the center of the algebra, i.e., the classical part, must be invariant as a set, and there is a well-defined restriction of Tt to the classical subsystem.

It is quite expected on general grounds: Any information gained about a quantum system requires a disturbance, and this is not compatible with reversibility. This No-Go theorem is lifted as soon as we allow irreversible evolutions. Indeed, one can develop a joint generalization of the theory of diffusions on the classical side and Lindblad Master equations on the quantum side, in which the salient information-disturbance tradeoffs have a natural and rigorous formulation.\nA traditional subject in classical probability are processes with independent increments. Since the increments are supposed to have the same distribution for any current state, this implies translation invariance, and since successive increments are assumed independent, we get a convolution semigroup (St \u2261 1I). The classic result is the L\u00e9vy\u2013Khintchine Theorem (see, e.g., [117]), characterizing the generators as a combination of a Gaussian part and a jump part. If we likewise stick to the choice of trivial St, this result applies verbatim to arbitrary hybrids. Even without quasifreeness assumption, it is treated in [35].\nFor the general case of an arbitrary semigroup St, the precise and general characterization of generators is lacking so far. It is easy to see that the L\u00e9vy\u2013Khintchine formula is still valid, but there are uncertainty-type constraints needed to ensure complete positivity. These are readily solved in the purely Gaussian case: The logarithmic derivative of the noise function at t = 0 has to be an admissible quantum covariance matrix for the \u201csymplectic form\u201d computed as the derivative of \u2206\u03c3. It turns out [118] that this is already all. In the general case, the L\u00e9vy\u2013Khintchine formula decomposes the generator into a Gaussian part and a jump part. The noise required for complete positivity depends only on the Gaussian part. The jump part, which belongs to a classical L\u00e9vy process, adds no further requirements, nor can it be used to ease the noise requirements for the Gaussian part. This is the situation for finite dimensional phase spaces, but the quasifree analogs for infinite dimension offer interesting challenges including generators not of Lindblad form [119, 120]).\nMany applications use the quasifree structure. Especially when time-dependent generators are involved, as in the case of feedback and control, it is vastly easier to put the process together in phase space than to multiply cp maps on the infinite-dimensional observable algebra. Continual observation is likewise a hybrid scenario, in which the classical part can be observed completely and at all times without incurring disturbance costs. Doing justice to this field would require a book of its own, and we do not even try to review the literature. The hybrid aspects are typically neglected, as are the demands of building usable observable algebras."

We have suppressed this parameter, which implicitly means that we used units for quantum position and quantum momentum, which make \u210f = 1. For the discussion of the classical limit, it is better to make this parameter explicit as a factor to the commutation form (4), just as physics textbooks have it. The identity map S between universes with different \u210f is then not symplectic, but one can build a (necessarily noisy) quasifree channel between such universes, allowing the comparison of observables. Equivalently, one can scale all phase space variables by \u221a \u210f. The connection maps are then used to formulate a notion of convergent sequences by a Cauchy-like condition. This approach to the classical limit [121] is as close to a limit of the entire theory (not just isolated aspects such as WKB wave functions or partition functions) as one can get. The limit is a classical canonical system, with quantum Hamiltonian dynamics going to its classical counterpart. For our context, it should be noted that it can be taken for parts of the system (like the heavy particles in a Born\u2013Oppenheimer approximation) and, due to the complete positivity of the connection maps, composes well with further degrees of freedom, i.e., can be applied to hybrids."

Let us consider a fixed system type (\u039e, \u03c3), which also serves as the input. At the output, we have N such systems in parallel, so \u039eout = \u2295N j \u039ej where \u039ej is just an isomorphic copy of the underlying \u039e = \u039ein.

The quasifree formalism then generates all possible error tradeoffs consistent with this overall behavior.\nThe optimal solution of this problem depends on how the quality of the clones is assessed, and in particular, whether one uses the average fidelity of the clones or the closeness of the overall output to a product state, i.e., whether one also demands the output systems to be nearly uncorrelated. The optimization problem should be stated without assuming quasifreeness, but one can prove that the optimal cloners will be quasifree with the above S. It turns out that for the criterion of overall product state fidelity, the optimal cloner is Gaussian, whereas for the average single state fidelity criterion, it is not, although the best Gaussian cloner performs only a few percent below optimum [123]. One can also look at asymmetric scenarios, in which the various copies satisfy different quality requirements, i.e., the output state is not permutation symmetric."

This is the setting in which one can discuss the tradeoff between information gain on the classical part of the output and disturbance on the quantum output (see Fig. 5).\nConcretely, let \u039eout = \u039ein \u2295 \u039ec, where \u039ec is the classical output. As in the case of a cloner, linearity of S implies that we just have to fix our demands for the marginals, i.e., the actions on the summands \u039ein and \u039ec, to get the overall map S. On the first summands, we just take the identity, in keeping with our intention to discuss the disturbance inflicted by the instrument. The case of \u201cno disturbance\u201d should be included, so we should take S = 1I on the summand \u039ein. For the second summand, \u039ec, we just have to say which variable or combination of variables we wish to measure, i.e., S is chosen exactly as the corresponding map S in (109) from the above description of observables. To distinguish it from the overall S, we denote this by Sc. Putting these parts together, we get\nS(\u03be \u2295 \u03b7) = \u03be + Sc\u03b7 (112)\nor, equivalently, S\u22a4\u03be = \u03be \u2295 S\u22a4c \u03be. The noise functions consistent with this choice then parametrize the class of covariant phase space instruments. Their analysis is a nice illustration of our theory. The main interest is again in the marginals, which reflect the tradeoffs between disturbance and information gain. We treat them in analogy to the corresponding observables.\nJust as for observables, the theory of quasifree instruments fits into the theory of covariant instruments for more general groups [125, 126, 127, 128]. We begin by outlining a heuristic argument\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-04, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 52\nsuggesting a form for general covariant instruments. We will verify later how this form comes out of our approach. As in the case of observables, we assume an operator density for the outputs as a function of the measured parameter: Its interpretation is the quantum channel conditioned on the classical output x. This captures a typical use of instruments, where the quantum state is updated based on the classical result. We are thus looking for a family of cp maps Tx such that the following analog of (106) holds:\nT \u2217(A\u2297 g) = \u222b dx T \u2217x (A)g(x). (113)\nPutting A = 1I, it is clear that T \u2217x is not a channel, as it is not normalized to the identity. Instead T \u2217x (1I) = F\u0307 (x) is the Radon\u2013Nikodym density of the classical marginal observable. Thus, if the classical marginal has no density, then T \u2217x cannot be defined either. On the other hand, if F\u0307 (x) exists, we can look for a bona fide channel T\u0303 \u2217x such that, with the abbreviation D(x) = F\u0307 (x)1/2, we have D(x)T\u0303 \u2217x (A)D(x) = T \u2217x (A). With the Kraus decomposition T\u0303 \u2217x (A) = \u2211 j Kj(x)\u2217AKj(x) we get T \u2217x (A) =\n\u2211 j (Kj(x)D(x))\u2217A Kj(x)D(x). (114)\nIt is clear from this formula that Kj(x) can be thought of as a map from the closed range of D to H, and should be normalized as \u2211 j Kj(x)\u2217Kj(x) = supp (D(x)), where the right hand side denotes the support projection of D(x). A feature shared with the observable case and the general group case is that T \u2217x (A) needs only be known at one point because this can be transferred to all x by covariance. Indeed, the covariance of the instrument is equivalent to T \u2217x+S\u22a4c \u03be = \u03b1\u2212\u03beT \u2217 x \u03b1\u03be. Thus \u03b1\u2212\u03beKj(x) = Kj(x+S\u22a4c \u03be), extending the covariance condition (107) for the observable F , written for D as \u03b1\u2212\u03beD(x) = D(x+S\u22a4c \u03be). Since S\u22a4c is surjective, we only need all values at the origin, and abbreviate D(0) =: D and Kj(0) = Kj . This gives the form\nT \u2217x (A) = \u2211\nj\n\u03b1\u2212\u03be ( KjD )\u2217 A \u03b1\u2212\u03be ( KjD ) , where S\u22a4c \u03be = x. (115)\nIn this general form the Kraus operators are only constrained by the normalization \u2211\nj K \u2217 jKj =\nsupp (D) and the invariance condition arising from the possibility that S\u22a4c \u03be = 0 might have nonzero solutions \u03be. In that case, we must demand that the Kj and the \u03b1\u03be(Kj) describe the same channel. In particular, for extremal instruments, when there is only one Kraus operator, it has to be invariant up to a phase.\nPosition instruments\nWe will illustrate our formalism by executing the task of finding all position instruments twice: Once directly via the characteristic functions and Prop. 24, and once in the way inspired by general covariance theory, i.e., via (115). For simplicity, we look only at the pure case, i.e., we are happy to find the simplest solutions from which all others arise by mixture.\nBeginning with our approach, we use the notational conventions for phase space and dual vectors outlined at the end of Sect. 2.1. Sc comes from the position observable (109), i.e., S(p\u0302, q\u0302, k) = (p\u0302+ k, q\u0302). All these quantities can be vectors p\u0302, q\u0302, k \u2208 Rn. Then\n(p\u0302, q\u0302, k) \u00b7 \u2206\u03c3(p\u0302\u2032, q\u0302\u2032, k\u2032) = p\u0302\u00b7q\u0302\u2032 \u2212 q\u0302\u00b7p\u0302\u2032 \u2212 (p\u0302+ k)\u00b7q\u0302\u2032 + q\u0302\u00b7(p\u0302\u2032 + k\u2032) = q\u0302\u00b7k\u2032 \u2212 k\u00b7q\u0302\u2032. (116)\nNow (116) is the commutation form of a hybrid phase space with quantum coordinates (q\u0302, k) and a classical direction p\u0302. A pure state on this hybrid fixes the classical part (cf. Lem. 2) to a point a, say, and is given on the quantum part by a vector \u03c8 on the Hilbert space of n degrees of freedom, defining the noise state \u03c4 . This gives the noise function\nf(p\u0302, q\u0302, k) = eia\u00b7p\u0302 \u03c7\u03c4 (k, q\u0302) = eia\u00b7p\u0302 \u27e8\u03c8,W (\u2212k, q\u0302)\u03c8\u27e9. (117)\nHere we chose the sign of k by a convention for \u03c8, for literal agreement with the second approach. Together with S, (117) is a complete description of the instrument.\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-04, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 53\nFor the approach via (115), with a single Kraus operator K we have to satisfy the normalization condition K\u2217K = supp D, and the invariance condition \u03b1\u03be(K) = u(q)K for \u03be = (0, q\u0302) \u2208 kerS\u22a4c . Inserting a sum for \u03be it is clear that u(q\u0302) = exp(\u2212ia\u00b7q\u0302) is a character. The eigenvalue equation for K is satisfied by the Weyl operator W (0,\u2212a), but in contrast to Lemma 18 the Weyl operators W (kerS\u22a4c ) do not act irreducibly, and so K is only determined up to an operator invariant under all \u03b1\u03be(0, q\u0302). Such operators commute with all W (\u03c3(0, q\u0302)) = W (q\u0302, 0), i.e. are multiplication operators in the position representation. Thus K = W (0,\u2212a)\u03c8\u0303(Q). Similarly, D = \u03c8D(Q) is a positive multiplication operator, whose square is the noise density \u03bd\u0307(Q) discussed above for the position observable, so \u03c8D \u2208 L2(Rn). The normalization condition K\u2217K = supp (D) means that |\u03c8\u0303(x)| = 1 for x \u2208 supp \u03c8D. Setting \u03c8(x) = \u03c8\u0303(x)\u03c8D(x), we get KD = W (0,\u2212a)\u03c8(Q), i.e.,(\nKD\u03d5 ) (x) = \u03c8(x\u2212 a)\u03d5(x\u2212 a). (118)\nComputing the characteristic function of the overall channel gives exactly (117) with the same \u03c8, a. So the two approaches give the same result, only with less analytical pain in our quasifree theory.\nWe are interested in the tradeoffs for the marginals, namely the quantum output, which is necessarily of the type discussed above under \u201cdisturbance\u201d, and the measurement output, which is of the type discussed under position observables. Both can be read off directly from the \u03c7out(p\u0302, q\u0302, k) = f(p\u0302, q\u0302, k)\u03c7in(p\u0302+ k, q\u0302), by setting suitable variables to zero:\nclassical marginal: p\u0302 = q\u0302 = 0, noise measure = \u03c4Q, quantum marginal: k = 0, noise measure = \u03b4a \u00d7 \u03c4P .\n(119)\nThis is a very concise formulation of a well-known intuition: \u03c4Q is the distribution of the noise added to the measurement outcomes, i.e., the \u201cerror\u201d of the measurement. \u03c4P , on the other hand, is the disturbance of the momentum variable. So these are reciprocal in exactly the way known for quantum states. We remark that noise could also occur in the quantum position direction, here given by a deterministic shift a. Non-pure instruments will have the distribution for that as well, and \u03c4 in the above description generally depends on a, allowing all the complex correlations in a hybrid noise state.\nPhase space instruments\nIn this case, S(\u03be\u2295\u03b7) = \u03be+\u03b7, and \u2206\u03c3 is non-degenerate, so the noise state is a quantum state of twice the number of degrees of freedom. In the pure case, it is given by a vector \u03c8 \u2208 L2(Rn\u00d7Rn, dx1, dx2). Such a vector can be identified with a Hilbert\u2013Schmidt operator over the system Hilbert space H = L2(Rn, dx), and we will see that this is precisely the required form of the local Kraus operator KD. This general form for phase space instruments was also obtained independently in [128]. In the following proposition, which is a straightforward application of our formalism, we also describe the resulting tradeoff between disturbance (noise in the quantum marginal) and precision (noise in the classical marginal). They are precisely related by Fourier transformation almost exactly as in the case of joint measurements of position and momentum. Only the Fourier transform is not between position and momentum but between the operator side and the function side of quantum harmonic analysis.\nProposition 35. (1) Every extremal quasifree phase space instrument is characterized by a Hilbert\u2013Schmidt operator \u03a8\u0302 with tr(\u03a8\u0302\u2217\u03a8\u0302) = 1 such that\nT \u2217(A\u2297 g) = \u222b d\u03be \u03b1\u2212\u03be(\u03a8\u0302)\u2217 A\u03b1\u2212\u03be(\u03a8\u0302) g(\u03be). (120)\n(2) Conversely, any such operator \u03a8\u0302 determines an instrument and is determined by it up to a phase.\n(3) The classical marginal is a covariant phase space observable with density F\u0307 = \u03a8\u0302\u2217\u03a8\u0302. (4) The quantum marginal is addition of translation noise: \u03c1 7\u2192 \u222b d\u03be m(\u03be)\u03b1\u03be(\u03c1) with m \u2208 L1(\u039e)\nm(\u03be) = |(F\u03a8\u0302)(\u2212\u03c3\u03be)|2. (121)\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-04, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 54\nNote that since F is unitary from the Hilbert\u2013Schmidt class onto L2(\u039e), not only all operator densities F\u0307 but also all L1-densities m can occur. The prototype of this tradeoff is the case of a single degree of freedom with additional covariance under harmonic oscillator rotations. In particular, we can look at the Gaussians \u03a8\u0302 = c exp(\u2212\u03b2H) with H = (P 2+Q2)/2. Then the Fourier transform is also Gaussian, and proportional to exp(\u2212 coth(\u03b2/2))\u03be2/4, where \u03be2 = (p2 + q2)/2. Now for \u03b2 \u2192 0, \u03a8\u0302 is a small multiple of the identity, so it can approximately be interchanged with A in (120). This even works in trace norm for the action on a trace class operator for the dual channel. This means that the disturbance goes to zero, and this is borne out by the computation of m, which for small \u03b2 is Gaussian with variance \u221d 1/\u03b2. On the other hand, the phase space density of the classical marginal becomes very broad, and the measurement outputs reveal very little about the state. In the other direction, \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e, \u03a8\u0302 becomes a coherent state projection, and the output distribution becomes the Husimi function. The quantum noise m is still Gaussian, with a variance on the order of standard quantum uncertainties.\nProof of Prop. 35. The difference symplectic form is now\n(\u03be, \u03b7) \u00b7 \u2206\u03c3(\u03be\u2032, \u03b7\u2032) = \u03be \u00b7 \u03c3\u03be\u2032 \u2212 (\u03be + \u03b7) \u00b7 \u03c3(\u03be\u2032 + \u03b7\u2032). (122)\nRather than expanding this, we just choose a twisted definite function, evaluated for the independent variables \u03be and \u03be + \u03b7. That is, for the extremal case, we choose a pure state on a doubled system, given by a vector \u03a8 \u2208 H \u2297 H such that\nf(\u03be \u2295 \u03b7) = \u27e8\u03a8|W (\u03be) \u2297W (\u03be + \u03b7)|\u03a8\u27e9. (123)\nHere the bar indicates complex conjugationW (\u03be) = \u03b8\u2217W (\u03be)\u03b8 with respect to an arbitrary antilinear involution \u03b8, which has the effect of reversing the symplectic form and hence takes care of the minus sign in (122). This completes the parametrization of the family of instruments. What is left is rewriting this in the stated form and computing the marginals.\nTo this end, we introduce the isomorphism \u03a8 7\u2192 \u03a8\u0302 form H \u2297 H to Hilbert\u2013Schmidt operators on H given by \u03c81 \u2297 \u03c82 7\u2192 |\u03c81\u27e9\u27e8\u03b8\u03c82|. Note that the involution \u03b8 is needed here so that both sides of the identification are linear in \u03c82. We next express the action of the Weyl operators in (123) in terms of the Hilbert\u2013Schmidt operators. For \u03a8 = \u03c81 \u2297 \u03c82, we get\nW (\u03be) \u2297W (\u03be + \u03b7)\u03a8 = (W (\u03be)\u03c81) \u2297 (\u03b8\u2217W (\u03be + \u03b7)\u03b8\u03c82) 7\u2192 |W (\u03be)\u03c81\u27e9\u27e8W (\u03be + \u03b7)\u03b8\u03c82| = W (\u03be) \u03a8\u0302 W (\u03be + \u03b7)\u2217. (124)\nInserting this into (123) gives the equivalent expression\nf(\u03be \u2295 \u03b7) = tr ( \u03a8\u0302\u2217W (\u03be)\u03a8\u0302W (\u03be + \u03b7)\u2217 ) . (125)\nDenoting the Weyl elements on the classical output by W0, and using the identity \u222b d\u03b6 \u03b1\u03b6(A) = tr(A)1I, we find\nT \u2217 ( W (\u03be) \u2297W0(\u03b7) ) = tr ( \u03a8\u0302\u2217W (\u03be)\u03a8\u0302W (\u03be + \u03b7)\u2217 ) W (\u03be + \u03b7)\n= \u222b d\u03b6 \u03b1\u03b6 ( \u03a8\u0302\u2217W (\u03be)\u03a8\u0302W (\u03be + \u03b7)\u2217 ) W (\u03be + \u03b7)\n= \u222b d\u03b6 \u03b1\u03b6 ( \u03a8\u0302 )\u2217 ei\u03b6\u00b7\u03beW (\u03be) \u03b1\u03b6 ( \u03a8\u0302 ) e\u2212i\u03b6\u00b7(\u03be+\u03b7) W (\u03be + \u03b7)\u2217 W (\u03be + \u03b7)\n= \u222b d\u03b6 \u03b1\u03b6 ( \u03a8\u0302 )\u2217 W (\u03be) \u03b1\u03b6 ( \u03a8\u0302 ) e\u2212i\u03b6\u00b7\u03b7\n= \u222b d\u03b6 \u03b1\u2212\u03b6 ( \u03a8\u0302 )\u2217 W (\u03be) \u03b1\u2212\u03b6 ( \u03a8\u0302 ) W0(\u03b7)(\u03b6). (126)\nThis coincides with (113) and (115) with g = W0(\u03b7), A = W (\u03be) and KD = \u03a8\u0302. The form of the classical marginal is obvious from (120) by putting A = 1I (resp. \u03be = 0 in (126)). For the quantum marginal, putting g = 1 leads to a form from which it is not even clear that it is just convolution\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-04, click title to verify.

Indeed, the function m in (121) is just the inverse Fourier transform of f(\u03be \u2295 0), i.e.,\nm(\u03b7) = (2\u03c0)\u22122n \u222b d\u03be ei\u03b7\u00b7\u03be f(\u03be \u2295 0) = (2\u03c0)\u22122n \u222b d\u03be ei\u03b7\u00b7\u03be tr ( \u03a8\u0302\u2217W (\u03be)\u03a8\u0302W (\u03be)\u2217 ) = (2\u03c0)\u22122n \u222b d\u03be ei\u03b7\u00b7\u03be tr ( \u03a8\u0302\u2217\u03b1\u03c3\u03be(\u03a8\u0302) ) = (2\u03c0)\u22122n \u222b d\u03be tr ( \u03a8\u0302\u2217\u03b1\u03c3\u03be(\u03a8\u0302W (\u2212\u03c3\u03b7))W (\u03c3\u03b7)\n) = tr ( \u03a8\u0302W (\u2212\u03c3\u03b7) ) tr ( \u03a8\u0302\u2217W (\u03c3\u03b7) ) =\n\u2223\u2223(F\u03a8\u0302)(\u2212\u03c3\u03b7)\u2223\u22232.

            "text": "The quasifree setting also provides a special angle on the well-known protocols of dense coding, and teleportation [129, 130, 131]. This is traditionally treated in finite-dimensional settings. Our setting can largely be generalized to cover finite dimensions and, in fact, arbitrary phase spaces built as the Cartesian product of a locally compact abelian group for position and its dual group for momentum. With a finite group the Hilbert spaces become finite-dimensional, and in the simplest case, this is the one-bit (=two-element) group with the Pauli matrices and identity as the Weyl operators. We will now take the qubit case as a guide and obtain a painless quasifree approach to \u201ccontinuous variable teleportation\u201d, generalizing the usual Gaussian schemes [132] to arbitrary non-Gaussian entangled resource states.\nThis will give some quasifree teleportation schemes, but not all have this property (cf. [131]). In any case, the quasifree angle suggests a natural interpretation of why the classical signals require 2 bit in the 1 qubit version: This is just the phase space associated to the qubit system. So we will take all systems involved as systems with the same phase space \u039e but different symplectic forms. Sender (Alice) and receiver (Bob) have quasifree devices with the same S, namely S\u03be = \u03be \u2295 \u03be. Only the symplectic forms need to be chosen so that the devices can be chosen to be noiseless (see Fig. 6). The verification of the protocol is then trivial and identical for teleportation and dense coding: The combination of the actions of Alice and Bob leads to a combined map S taking \u03be 7\u2192 \u03be \u2295 \u03be 7\u2192 \u03be \u2295 \u03be \u2295 \u03be. That is, in Fig. 6 the boxes in the top row together have one output arrow and three input arrows. Evaluating this with the entangled state provided, say with characteristic function \u03c7 gives the overall S = 1I with the noise function \u03c7(\u03be \u2295 \u03be). The Fourier transform of this function would be the probability density for the shifts that constitute the errors of the process (cp. Sect.5.2). The task for constructing a good protocol is therefore to bring \u03c7(\u03be \u2295 \u03be) as close to 1 as possible. This is discussed in detail in Lem. 9.\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-04, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 56"

            "text": "We have developed a framework for canonical hybrid systems in which quasifree channels can be discussed with remarkable ease and full generality. In several ways, this theory is simpler than more specialized versions. This is an instance of the inventor\u2019s paradox (\u201cThe more general problem may have the simpler solution\u201d). For example, if one is not interested in measurement, and classical inputs and outputs, one could have expected a simpler theory by dropping all the classical variables and restricting to purely quantum systems. However, channels in that context would still satisfy a positivity condition belonging to a hybrid state, and the noise factorization (Thm. 34) would provide an analysis of the noise in the channel as partly classical and partly quantum. This would suggest allowing hybrids from the outset, and indeed we saw that this does not make the theory any harder.\nA second case of the inventor\u2019s paradox in this paper is the lack of a Gaussian assumption. Gaussian quasifree channels are those for which f has a Gaussian form and is hence given by a covariance matrix. We actually started out by looking at Heisenberg picture questions for this class, e.g., \u201cIs phase space continuity (as in Cu(\u039e, \u03c3)) automatically preserved by Gaussian channels?\u201d. It turned out that the Gaussian simplification did not help at all for this, and more and more such issues were resolved in the general quasifree setting of the current paper.\nAnother simplification lies in the \u00b5-free approach, whose distinction from a \u00b5-dependent one is sketched at the beginning of Sect. 3. The gain is to include pure states and, taken together with the previous paragraph, extremal channels. Here we had to go to considerable functional analytic lengths, but the result is simple and easy to apply: A variety of choices for hybrid observable algebras that can be used systematically with automatic Heisenberg picture description for the full class of quasifree channels.\nSeveral directions for further work present themselves. Some have already been mentioned above:\n\u2022 Specialize to the Gaussian case, i.e., the case where all noise functions have Gaussian form. This class is well known [133, 25], and practically important [134], and allows a complete reduction to the finite-dimensional analysis of covariance matrices together with the S-operators between phase spaces. One gets a simple toolbox in which the tradeoffs of information gain and disturbance can all be described in finite-dimensional matrix terms.\n\u2022 Generalize to hybrids with general, i.e., not quasifree channels. The key element in Sect. 3 is the local compactness of the classical parameter space, but to get good channels, we also used the continuity of characteristic functions, and hence the group structure of phase space. Can one get a good class of channels without that?\n\u2022 Replace the phase space by an arbitrary locally compact abelian group, and the Weyl operators by a projective representation. A lot of the theory described here will carry over, but it is a matter of careful screening to identify the limits of this generalization.\n\u2022 Consider the Fermionic and mixed CAR/CCR case.\n\u2022 Allow infinite dimensional \u039e. The aim would be applications in quantum field theory. So far, mostly the case of symplectic maps has been considered under the heading of Bogolyubov transformations. However, in order to bring some operational elements to the theory, noisy operations like counting processes and other interventions are very interesting, and the quasifree category is an ideal testing ground. These aspects are sorely underdeveloped in all schools of QFT, but a better understanding seems to be emerging [135, 136].\n\u2022 Analyze dynamical semigroups. This was described in more detail in Sect. 5.4.\n\u2022 The intersection of the previous two items gives quasifree hybrid semigroups on infinite dimensional spaces [86, 137, 138]. Thorough work exists in the case of classical noise, e.g., when a unitary group is controlled by a driving Markov process [138]. One interesting issue is the possibility and structure of quantum dynamical semigroup generators, which are not of Lindblad (or Arveson type I [120]) form [119].\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-06-04, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 57\n\u2022 One of the beautiful results in Gaussian Quantum Information is the growing evidence [139, 140] that the variational problems in the capacity theory of Gaussian channels have Gaussian maximizers. This involves the discussion of relative entropies and Gibbs states for quadratic Hamiltonians, which surely have hybrid versions, possibly even with some relevance to the Gaussian maximizer conjecture.\n\u2022 Explore the resolvent algebra, and potential applications of Example 28 to quantum field theory. In particular, analyze the sum decomposition (86), and the ideals of R(\u039e, \u03c3) in the light of correspondence theory, and study the continuity of dynamical evolutions.\n\u2022 Further explore the understanding of the Paschke dilation [105, 141] as the basic dilation statement in the category of W*-algebras with completely positive normal maps. This reduces to the Stinespring dilation when the input system is a quantum system with observable algebra B(H). A good start has been made in [105], but many issues that have been treated traditionally by the Stinespring construction should allow a treatment in this more general setting."
