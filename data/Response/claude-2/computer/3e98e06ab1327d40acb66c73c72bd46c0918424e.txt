 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after reading this paper on time-based addiction and behavioral design in video games:

1. Conduct experiments manipulating different elements of game design to determine which specific features have the strongest influence on addictive gameplay. For example, test the effects of variable reward schedules, social competition, endless play, etc.

2. Explore the effectiveness of using time loss aversion and framing time as a loss to reduce video game addiction. Test different ways of framing time spent gaming as an aggregated loss over longer periods. 

3. Investigate differences between genres and platforms in promoting addictive behavior. Compare addictive potential of mobile, console, PC, and VR games as well as different genres like FPS, RPGs, MOBAs. 

4. Study the impacts of addictive gameplay on cognitive abilities and real-world functioning. Assess how excessive gaming may impair skills like attention, memory, planning, and impulse control.

5. Develop and evaluate interventions to treat video game addiction, incorporating insights from behavioral design. Test cognitive behavioral therapy, moderated gameplay, and fostering alternative hobbies.
