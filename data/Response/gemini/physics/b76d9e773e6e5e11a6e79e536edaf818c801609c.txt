1. **Investigate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of G2 in vivo.** This would involve studying the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of G2 in animal models, as well as its effects on AKT phosphorylation and tumor growth. This information would be essential for designing clinical trials of G2.


2. **Evaluate the efficacy of G2 in combination with other anti-cancer agents.** Curcumin has been shown to synergize with a variety of other anti-cancer drugs, including sorafenib, doxorubicin, and paclitaxel. It would be interesting to see if G2 also exhibits synergy with these drugs, as this could lead to improved outcomes in patients with HCC.


3. **Explore the use of G2 for the prevention of HCC.** Curcumin has been shown to inhibit the development of HCC in animal models. It would be interesting to see if G2 also has this effect, as this could lead to new strategies for preventing HCC in high-risk individuals.


4. **Investigate the molecular mechanisms by which G2 inhibits AKT phosphorylation.** The paper suggests that G2 inhibits AKT phosphorylation by binding to the AKT protein and preventing its activation. However, the exact molecular mechanisms by which this occurs are not fully understood. Further research is needed to elucidate these mechanisms, as this could lead to the development of new AKT inhibitors with improved potency and selectivity.


5. **Conduct clinical trials of G2 in patients with HCC.** The ultimate goal of this research is to develop a new treatment for HCC. To achieve this, it will be necessary to conduct clinical trials of G2 in patients with HCC. These trials will evaluate the safety and efficacy of G2, and will help to determine whether it is a promising new treatment for this deadly disease.
