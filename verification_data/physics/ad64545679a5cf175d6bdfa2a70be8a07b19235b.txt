"In this review, we provide comprehensive advances in the fields of ALA and R-ALA synthesis to inspire the scientific community to develop innovations. [...] While these methods generally focus on basic scientific research, few of them have proposed synthetic pathways for industrial production. For example, continuous-flow chemistry, enzyme engineering, and other new technologies could have broadly applications in the total synthesis of ALA to achieve efficient, economical, and energy-saving industrial production. The ability to combine new technologies advances numerous possibilities for creating cheaper and higher quality products to fulfill the needs of the population. The development of these new technologies will undoubtedly benefit future applications. Furthermore, new technologies and strategies will be implemented in the synthesis of ALA to provide ideas and insights for scientific researchers and peers, associated with these realms and aspects in the long run."
