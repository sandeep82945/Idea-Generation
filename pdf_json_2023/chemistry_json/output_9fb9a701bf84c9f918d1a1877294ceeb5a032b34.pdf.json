    "abstractText": "The metabolic profiles of human feces are influenced by various genetic and environmental factors, which makes feces an attractive biosample for numerous applications, including the early detection of gut diseases. However, feces is complex, heterogeneous, and dynamic with a significant live bacterial biomass. With such challenges, stool metabolomics has been understudied compared to other biospecimens, and there is a current lack of consensus on methods to collect, prepare, and analyze feces. One of the critical steps required to accelerate the field is having a metabolomics stool reference material available. Fecal samples are generally presented in two major forms: fecal water and lyophilized feces. In this study, two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC\u00d7GC-TOFMS) was used as an analytical platform to characterize pooled human feces, provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as ResearchGrade Test Materials. The collected fecal samples were derived from eight healthy individuals with two different diets: vegans and omnivores, matched by age, sex, and body mass index (BMI), and stored as fecal water and lyophilized feces. Various data analysis strategies were presented to determine the differences in the fecal metabolomic profiles. The results indicate that the sample storage condition has a major influence on the metabolic profiles of feces such that the impact from storage surpasses the metabolic differences from the diet types. The findings of the current study would contribute towards the development of a stool reference material.",

            "text": "Metabolomics is the comprehensive study of small molecules (<1500 Da) in biological samples commonly known as metabolites, and the complete set of all the metabolites is referred as the metabolome [1,2]. Studies have shown that a combination of genetic and environmental factors can influence the metabolome [3\u20135]. Organisms\u2019 responses to conditions such as disease or environment alter their metabolic profiles, and the resulting changes can be detected in biological samples, which reveal information indicative of the host\u2019s state of health [6,7]. Vast applications in metabolomics were achieved using numerous biological matrices, which include blood, urine, feces, saliva, sweat, breath, and tissue [8\u201317]. Of these biological sample types, feces is a vital source for unraveling intricate biological processes of host\u2013microbiome interactions in a non-invasive way [18,19]. To truly access and exploit the information feces presents, analytical challenges in studying feces need to be appropriately addressed [19\u201321]. Feces, a solid waste product containing undigested food residues, has a highly complex, dynamic, and heterogeneous nature [19]. Therefore, pre-analytical aspects, including sample storage and preparation, are crucial to ensure sample integrity is maintained and unintended post-collection changes\nMetabolites 2023, 13, 828. https://doi.org/10.3390/metabo13070828 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/metabolites\nMetabolites 2023, 13, 828 2 of 12\nwithin a sample are avoided. These changes are due to ongoing processes such as oxidation, degradation, and bacterial or enzymatic activities [22\u201324]. Despite the awareness of the importance of sample handling for feces, there is currently no consensus on how fecal samples should be handled prior to analysis for unbiased stool metabolomics [25,26]. Using fresh stool samples immediately after collection (within an hour) is usually unrealistic, especially for large-scale metabolomics studies. To store samples until analysis, two sample conditions are commonly used: lyophilized feces [26,27] and fecal water (aqueous phase) [28\u201330]. Different sample conditions may affect the composition and metabolic profile of the sample. Consequently, they may influence the discovery of biomarkers and the characterization of metabolic phenotypes. However, to the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, a systematic study has not been conducted to compare the two sample conditions generally used in stool metabolomics. Most fecal metabolomics studies have been carried out using mass spectrometry (MS)-based techniques and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy [20,21,31\u201333]. For MS-based platforms, they are generally coupled with a high-performance separation instrument such as gas chromatography (GC) or liquid chromatography (LC) [21,27,32,34]. Amongst many analytical platforms, GC\u00d7GC-TOFMS is a well-suited tool for untargeted studies of complex metabolomics samples [1,26,35\u201337]. GC\u00d7GC employs two independent separation mechanisms with different chemistries and offers many analytical advantages compared to a conventional one-dimensional GC system. It provides enhanced sensitivity and dynamic range with an order-of-magnitude increase in separation capacity and can routinely detect thousands of compounds in a single sample. Herein, pooled human stool samples from two cohorts (omnivore and vegan), stored in two conditions (lyophilized and aqueous), were evaluated to compare the metabolomic profiles using GC\u00d7GC-TOFMS. The study was conducted as a part of an interlaboratory study led by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in an effort to develop a human stool reference material for metabolomics and microbiome studies. All the samples used in the study were provided by the NIST. Only the data obtained from the GC\u00d7GC-TOFMS system by the authors are presented in this work with a particular focus on the data analysis, discussing the results comprehensively using various approaches."

All whole-stool samples were collected after informed consent under approved Institutional Review Boards protocols at TBC. Stool samples were collected from 8 volunteer donors: 2 vegan females, 2 vegan males, 2 omnivore females, and 2 omnivore males. Attempts were made to match volunteers for each diet cohort by age, sex, and BMI so that diet would be the main difference between the two cohorts. The volunteers ranged between 20 and 65 for age and 18.5 and 29.9 for BMI and were all surveyed for health and diet. The donors were self-reported as healthy with no antibiotic use within 60 days of donation and no routine use of other medication. The samples were deposited into a BioCollectorTM and shipped overnight on an ice brick (the sample temperature was maintained at approximately 4 \u25e6C). Upon receipt, each sample was segmented into 30 g to 50 g portions, stored in specimen collection jars, and placed at \u221280 \u25e6C until processing. A portion of the first stool sample from each donor was subjected to pathogen screening for HIV, Hepatitis B, and Hepatitis C using the Biogates One Step Rapid Diagnostic Tests. The material was homogenized and aliquoted by TBC and preserved either in an aqueous form (100 mg wet stool/mL in water, stored frozen at \u221280 \u25e6C) or lyophilized (aliquoted at 100 mg wet stool/mL into lyophilization vials and freeze dried). All aliquots (lyophilized and aqueous) were shipped to the NIST on dry ice and placed immediately into \u221280 \u25e6C storage upon arrival (NIST report in preparation). The pooled human fecal samples of two diet cohorts (omnivores and vegans) stored in two preservation methods (lyophilization and frozen aqueous) were provided as Research-Grade Test Materials by the NIST.\nMetabolites 2023, 13, 828 3 of 12\nThese four groups (2 diets \u00d7 2 storage conditions) were denoted as LV, LO, AV, and AO, representing lyophilized vegans, lyophilized omnivores, aqueous vegans, and aqueous omnivores, respectively, for the rest of the manuscript. For each of the four groups, three replicate sample vials were originally provided by the NIST. Each sample vial was analyzed in duplicate, rendering six replicates per group, resulting in a total of 24 analytical runs for the current study."

All detected peaks were searched against the NIST-MS 2017 Library mass spectral database. The processed chromatograms were aligned using the Statistical Compare feature of ChromaTOF\u00ae. To obtain the basic statistics and the most predominant metabolites discussed in Sections 3.1 and 3.2, each diet style and storage condition was aligned separately. For projection on PCA addressed in Section 3.3, all 24 samples from four groups were aligned together. To determine the distinguishing metabolites, combinations of two groups were aligned with the details explained in Section 3.3. The Fisher ratio was calculated from the Statistical Compare feature. For all alignments, the same parameters were used. Tolerances for retention time shift were set to \u00b16 modulation periods in the first dimension and 0.2 s for the second dimension, with a minimum similarity of 600 for a spectral match. The threshold of S/N 20 was set for peaks not found by the initial peak finding to be included. Only the peaks in a minimum of 5 samples or in a minimum of 50% of samples in a class were kept.\nEach aligned peak table was then exported as a .csv file and imported into MATLAB\u00ae\n2020a. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed using PLS_Toolbox 9.1 (Eigenvector Research Inc., Wenatchee, WA, USA). The Total Useful Peak Area (TUPA), representing the sum of the peak areas of the common peaks in all of the samples, was used as a normalization factor [35]. The compound class analysis and jitter plots described in Section 3.4 were generated using Microsoft Excel 2013."

The chromatograms of all six replicates for each condition were included in the Supplementary Information (SI) to demonstrate the reproducibility. It is noteworthy that the storage conditions had a more pronounced impact on metabolic profiles than the diets. From just visually screening the raw chromatograms, the differences in metabolic profiles for different storage conditions were perceivably apparent (Figure 1). Compared to the aqueous samples, the lyophilized samples had more intense peaks of saturated and unsaturated C18 fatty acids, which eluted in the region of 2850\u20132950 s in the first dimension as well as a busier later region of the chromatogram (above 3500 s), which is where bile acids and sterols elute. Comparing LV and LO, significant differences were not noted, other than LO displaying an intense peak in the region of 3180 s, which was unable to be identified due to the distortion of a peak shape owing to overloading. AV and AO indicated intensity differences for some peaks but did not exhibit apparent differences in terms of metabolic profiles using TIC.\nMetabolites 2023, 13, 828 5 of 12\nMetabolites 2023, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 13\npeak in the region of 3180 s, which was unable to be identified due to the distortion of a\npeak shape owing to overloading.

For omnivores, 13 compounds for lyophilized and 18 compounds for aqueous samples had a relative abundance above 1%, which comprised 29.09% and 34.36% of the total peak area, respectively (Table 2).\nMetabolites 2023, 13, 828 7 of 12\nL-5-Oxoproline was detected as the most abundant compound in all four groups, with a similar relative abundance across the conditions ranging from 5.55% to 5.96%. Pyroglutamic acid and tyrosine were also at a high level in all four conditions, with the relative abundance ranging from 2.32% to 3.46% and 1.18% to 1.82%, respectively. 7Hpurine was a notable compound, which existed in high concentrations in the three groups except in the lyophilized vegan samples, where the relative abundance was only 0.02%. Other predominant metabolites commonly present at high levels in both types of vegan samples included leucine and glycine. Phenylalanine, proline, and ribose were found to be the abundant metabolites with a relative abundance above 1% in both lyophilized and aqueous omnivore samples. On the other hand, sugar compounds, including ribose and arabinose, were detected at high levels in the lyophilized samples of the two diets. Alanine, glycine, valine, ribose, and xylose were present in high levels for the aqueous samples of both diets."

The additional steps involved in the lyophilization process while risking the loss of some volatiles may have contributed to the added variations. Larger variations were observed for the class of nucleosides compared to the other classes due to the low intensities and fewer number of the members of the compounds that belong to the class. For fatty acids, bile acids, tocopherols, and sterols, the lyophilized samples had higher intensities than the aqueous samples. This result is thought to be attributed to the wet and slushy nature of aqueous samples, which makes it difficult to extract fatty and bulky compounds. In contrast, lyophilization makes samples more prone to release metabolites, resulting in the intensification of signals [26].
