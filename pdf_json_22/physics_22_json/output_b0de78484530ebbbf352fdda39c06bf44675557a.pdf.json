    "abstractText": "Bridging the \u201cterahertz gap\u201c relies upon synthesizing arbitrary waveforms in the terahertz domain enabling applications that require both narrow band sources for sensing and few-cycle drives for classical and quantum objects. However, realization of custom-tailored waveforms needed for these applications is currently hindered due to limited flexibility for optical rectification of femtosecond pulses in bulk crystals. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that thin-film lithium niobate circuits provide a versatile solution for such waveform synthesis by combining the merits of complex integrated architectures, low-loss distribution of pump pulses on-chip, and an efficient optical rectification. Our distributed pulse phase-matching schemegrants shaping the temporal, spectral, phase, amplitude, and farfield characteristics of the emitted terahertz field through designer on-chip components. This strictly circumvents prior limitations caused by the phase-delay mismatch in conventional systems and relaxes the requirement for cumbersome spectral pre-engineering of the pumping light. We propose a toolbox of basic blocks that produce broadband emission up to 680 GHz and far-field amplitudes of a few V m with adaptable phase and coherence properties by using nearinfrared pump pulse energies below 100 pJ.",

However, realization of custom-tailored waveforms needed for these applications is currently hindered due to limited flexibility for optical rectification of femtosecond pulses in bulk crystals. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that thin-film lithium niobate circuits provide a versatile solution for such waveform synthesis by combining the merits of complex integrated architectures, low-loss distribution of pump pulses on-chip, and an efficient optical rectification. Our distributed pulse phase-matching schemegrants shaping the temporal, spectral, phase, amplitude, and farfield characteristics of the emitted terahertz field through designer on-chip components. This strictly circumvents prior limitations caused by the phase-delay mismatch in conventional systems and relaxes the requirement for cumbersome spectral pre-engineering of the pumping light. We propose a toolbox of basic blocks that produce broadband emission up to 680 GHz and far-field amplitudes of a few V m\u22121 with adaptable phase and coherence properties by using nearinfrared pump pulse energies below 100 pJ.\nThe terahertz (THz) region (typically defined between 0.1 and 10THz) has proven to be critical for numerous applications in both fundamental science and industry, including communications1\u20133, sensing4, non-invasive imaging5, nanoscopy4,6,7 and ultrafast classical and quantum systems. In particular, detecting THz radiation is central to spectroscopy since the THz range hosts low-energy material resonances. For example, THz radiation plays an ever-increasing role in security and diagnostic medicine, due to its non-invasive, non-ionizing8 ability to distinguish between different types of materials with higher resolution than microwaves: metals, water, and various organic compounds. On the other hand, THz waves can be utilized to control elementary excitations such as electrons9, spins10, molecular motion11 and photons12 on shorter timescales than microwaves in miniaturized transducers that link THz systems with other systems. This speed advantage is crucial for the exploration of novel materials and their ultimate limits, such as low-dimensional, magnetic13, Pockels14 or superconducting15materials, e.g., before decoherence times. Finally, in communications, THz wireless links may leverage the possibility to employ narrow-angle, directional beams16 as an information channel instead of wide-angle broadcasting that is nowadays the standard in microwaves. The realization of these applications is contingent on the ability to control the temporal waveform of THz fields on sub-THz-cycle scales. Thus, providingmeans for their synthesis at will is of high importance. As a result, the next generation of THz systems requires customtailoring various features of the electromagnetic waves, including their\nReceived: 1 April 2022\nAccepted: 7 December 2022\nCheck for updates\n1ETH Zurich, Institute of QuantumElectronics, Zurich, Switzerland. 2Harvard John A.

Currently, the THz range is generally challenging to access both using optical and electronic technologies. Notable progress in the miniaturization of THz devices has been made in the area of quantum cascade lasers that now operate without the need for cryogenic gases17,18; however, their emission is in the upper range of the THz domain (1.5\u2013100THz). Furthermore, pulsed emission is generally tricky directly from a THz quantum cascade laser, but active mode-locking has been demonstrated19. High-frequency spintronic emitters20 or optical Kerr combs21,22 have generated stable THz radiation but with limited control over the frequency of the output wave.\nA much more widely adopted method for the generation and detection of THz is to utilize second-order (\u03c7(2)) nonlinear processes driven by compact and high-power ultrafast lasers in the near-infrared region. Optical rectification is a generation mechanism for THz radiation that exhibits many useful features and in particular has been extensively used for the generation of high electric field strengths. In this \u03c7(2) process, an intense laser beam generates a nonlinear polarization P(2)(t) following its intensity envelope I0(t). If the incident optical beam is a femtosecond pulse, the generated field can be a broadband THz pulse that contains few cycles23,24. Lithium niobate (LN)24\u201327 has always been an excellent choice of material for THz generation, owing to its high nonlinear coefficient of d33 = 27 pmV\u22121 28, and low optical losses in the near-infrared. LN\u2019s high optical power handling is crucial for optical rectification since the power of the generated THz signal depends quadratically on the optical pump power.\nTo date, the THz generation schemes through optical rectification have been largely limited to bulk systems. In this area, several works stand out that achieve custom-tailoring of terahertz radiation, by using quasi-phase-matched crystals29\u201333 and arbitrarily poled crystals34 to tailor the frequency and amplitude of terahertz radiation, or polarization-shaped pump pulses to tailor the polarization of the emitted terahertz radiation35.\nThe above bulk generation schemes are well suited for high-field generation but have several shortcomings. First, further customtailoring of the emission is achieved either through pre-conditioning the pumppulse preceding the nonlinear crystal (e.g., through complex pump pulse shaping36,37, external switches38 or multi-pulse setups39) or post-conditioning of a broadband terahertz pulse after its emission into free space (by diffractive surfaces40 or switches41). Second, the phase-matching properties inside the bulk crystals are fixed by the refractive index mismatch at THz and pumping frequencies in bulk crystals and cannot be controlled. This fact results in the emission of Cherenkov radiation at a fixed angle in bulk LN. Third, bulk LN crystals need to be pumped close to their surface to avoid the high absorption of THz radiation in this material, but ensuring minimal distance to the surface is challenging in bulk crystals that provide no fine-tuned control over the exact propagation of the pumping field. Finally, achieving sub-THz-cycle precision of various degrees of freedom in the waveform design is challenging as their high number would inevitably increase the complexity of bulk systems. Early work recognized that miniaturizationmay provide solutions to these issues, such as, e.g., ion slicing bulk crystals into thinner slabs42. With advances in nanostructuring TFLN23, few theoretical proposals to generate THz radiation appeared recently43, along with experimental proposals of using topological confinement in laser-written LN slabs44.\nIn this work, we depart from the generation in bulk crystals and instead demonstrate chip-based generation of terahertz transients inside low-loss integrated photonic circuits in lithium niobate. We show that this implementation circumvents shortcomings of bulk systems and additionally provides uniquely versatile control over the temporal, spectral, phase, amplitude, and farfield characteristics of the generated waveform by design of chip-scale components alone (a detailed comparison of our work with various former approaches to generate arbitrary THz waveforms is provided in\nSupplementary Note 6). We exploit several unique features of TFLN platform that cannot at all, or only hardly, be realized in bulk crystals. First, we employ rib waveguides that allow THz generation within a few hundred of nanometers close to the surface, minimizing its absorption. Second, our low-loss fabrication capabilities allow us to connect several basic components of this platform such as grating couplers, y-splitters, and combiners for the proposed arbitrary waveform synthesis on one single chip. Paired with the wide transmission window of LN and its high power resilience, this allows us to guide pump pulses of energy of 100 pJ through complex device architectures without significant losses or denaturation of the nonlinear material. Third, the monolithic patterning of THz antennas around the waveguides provides themissing ability to not only control the spectral and temporal properties of the emitted THz radiation, but also its emission pattern into the farfield by the design of the antenna alone. Finally, the ability to choose the waveguide dimensions allows for precise control over the effective mode index, the group index, as well as the field confinement of both the pump pulses and the terahertz field as they interact in the antenna region."

The ultrashort pump pulses are polarized along the [001]-axis of LN lying the in the thin-film plane. Due to the high nonlinear tensor element d33 in LN the propagating pulses induce a polarization P(2) (t) (inset II) that generates a local electric field amplitude dElocal at all positions along the antenna gap:\ndE local\u00f0\u03a9,y\u00de=Cgap I0\u00f0\u03a9\u00de \u03a9 exp i ng\u03a9 c y dy, \u00f01\u00de\nwhich sums up to an overall field EOR\u00f0\u03a9\u00de= R lgap 0 dE local\u00f0\u03a9,y\u00de acting as a source of THz radiation (Fig. 1, inset III, detailed deviation in SupplementaryNote 2A).

At low frequencies, the THz field profile is independent of the pulse length, therefore its amplitude increases linearly with frequency (compare Supplementary Fig. 4). In the antenna\u2019s gap, the portion of the THz field matching the resonance, described by a responsivity function R(\u03a9), is outcoupled from the waveguide into free space with a dipolar emission pattern (Fig. 1, inset III). The total outcoupled field is given by:\nETHz\u00f0\u03a9\u00de= EOR\u00f0\u03a9\u00de R\u00f0\u03a9\u00de: \u00f02\u00de\nThe resulting temporal waveform depends on the center frequency and linewidth of the antenna as well as the spectral and temporal characteristics of the pumping pulse. In TFLN platform, we can safely ignore THz absorption in LN due to the small propagation length of the emitted wave inside the 600 nm thick waveguide (see inset V and supporting transmission characterization of the bulk substrate in Supplementary Note 1C). Furthermore, an antenna gap of widthwg = 3 \u03bcm supports efficient generation along the gap while maintaining low absorption losses of the pump pulse caused by antenna electrodes (see Supplementary Note 1A, B). The phase delay associated with each position along the antenna gap where the terahertz is generated is linked to the group velocity of the optical pulse vg =\nc ng (simulation providing ng in Supplementary Note 1B).\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:11 2\nIn conclusion, the effective generation length can be written as:\nleff \u00f0\u03a9\u00de= Z lgap 0 exp i ng\u03a9 c y dy \u2223= lgap \u2223 sinc ng\u03a9 2c lgap : \u00f03\u00de\nlgap corresponds in the present study to a fraction of the THz field period (hence lgap<\n2\u03c0c ng\u03a9 ) for the antenna designs investigated (detailed derivation in Supplementary Note 2B).We define the coherence length as lcoh =\nc 4ng f THz .\nDistributed pulse phase matching The low near-infrared losses of the TFLN platform45 allow the pumping of several antennas using a single pulse. This provides an additional knob to tailor the THz emission, besides the individual antenna design parameters. We introduce a parallel and a serial architecturewhere one pulse is used to pumpmultiple devices (Fig. 1, bottom devices). In this scheme, the resulting THz waveform\ndepends strictly on the arrangement of antennas on-chip, their geometric distances and the group delay of the pumping pulses. This dependency can be summarized as a phasematchingmechanism\u2014to which we refer as distributed pulse phase matching\u2014that is conceptually related to phased arrays with few-cycle pulses as the interfering fields (see Supplementary Note 2C). Distributed pulse phase matching is critical for the synthesis of arbitrary electric fields (the theoretical formalism is given in Supplementary Note 2D). In the parallel block, this enables constructive or destructive interference of THz pulses (inset IV), if antennas with identical parameters are employed. In the serial case, once the group delay \u03c4g of the pumping pulse between two serial antennas matches their resonant period TTHz (and hence \u03c4g =\n1 f THz =TTHz), the generated pulses interfere constructively out-of-plane and increase the temporal coherence of the generated radiation (inset VI). Furthermore, the inplane arrangement of antennas impacts the three-dimensional pattern of the emission, e.g., by increasing the aperture of generated THz light.\ny\nz x\nIntroduced nonlinear polarization P(2)(t) ~ d33 I0(t)\n+ -\n+\n-\n+\n-\nIntensity envelope of pump pulse I0(t)\nEmitted THz radiation ETHz(t) (near field)\ny\nz\nx\nlgap\nlow-loss LN waveguide\nTHz antenna\ndistributed pump pulses\nEmitted far field (series block)\n+\n+\n=\nWaveguide cross-section\nLN Au SiO2 Si\nEmitted far field (parallel block)\n+ =\ngrating coupler\nI.

A single THz emitter consists of an etched TFLN waveguide and a THz antenna (upper center chip design). Femtosecond pulses (shown in red) are coupled into the low-loss TFLN waveguides of width wwg = 1.5\u03bcm and pass through the two electrodes of a THz bow-tie antenna (shown in yellow) separated by awidthwg (defined in inset V). THz radiation (shown inblue/purple) is generated through optical rectification in the antenna gap region delimited by parallel gold bars of length lgap. The femtosecond pump pulse (inset I) generates a second-order polarization P(2)(t) that follows its envelope inside the \u03c7(2) waveguide (inset II). The nonlinear polarization inside the gap drives the emission of a broadband THz field ETHz(t) into free space at the resonance frequency of the antenna (inset III). Several antennasmay be combined to a single device. The layout\nof the waveguides on chip and the relative position of antennas set the timing and the interference pattern in the farfield of THz emission. Parallel (lower left chip design) and serial (lower right chip design) blocks of antennas enable tailoring the temporal and spectral properties of the THz radiation. In the parallel configuration, the emitted waves from each antenna can interfere constructively and/or destructively following the phase-relation set by the relative distance between the two antennas in the farfield (inset IV).

In particular, we study the impact of the antenna length Lant, and gap length lgap. lgap delimits the generation length by the geometrical dimensions of the two parallel gold bars. Lant determines the antenna resonance frequency and the temporal shapeof the emittedTHzfields. Themeasured time-trace of the THz electricfield displays several rapid cycles for the shorter antenna (Lant = 57\u03bcm) compared to the larger antenna (Lant = 200\u03bcm) that rather emits a strong pulse with a slower cycle (Fig. 2a, b). The latter is followed by low-frequency oscillations that are characteristic of the antenna\u2019s lower resonant frequency. The peak-to-peak electric fieldmeasures in both cases roughly0.25 Vm\u22121. In the frequency domain, the initial portion of the THz pulse in Fig. 2b\ncorresponds to a broad resonant background spanning up to 350GHz that is typical for bow-tie antennas, whereas the lasting oscillations afterward can be associated with the resonance frequency of the antenna at 200 GHz shown in Fig. 2c (light blue line).\nThe measured spectra of antennas with various Lant (40\u2013200\u03bcm) showcase a tailorable THz emission between 180 and 680GHz. The peak of the emission shifts toward higher frequencies for the shorter Lant (Fig. 2c).We choose lgap to correspond to only a fraction of theTHz resonant frequency (lgap = Lant 2 ) for all antennas. The frequency generated by optical rectification is limited by the pulse duration of the pump signal which is dispersed by the input fiber to the TFLN chip (setupdescribed in theMethods section \u201cOptical setup\u201d and indetail in Supplementary Note 5A, the influence of dispersion and potential nonlinear effects inside the fiber and TFLN waveguides is discussed in Supplementary Note 3A). In combination with the lower emission efficiency of smaller bow-tie antennas the signal strength decreases for higher frequencies. Thereby our experimental results are in full agreement with finite element method simulations performed using CST Microwave studio (details in Supplementary Note 4A).\nThe generation length lgap influences the amplitude of the THz field through the effective generation length andmust generally satisfy lgap < lcoh.

The measured peak of the THz spectrum shifts toward lower frequencies for larger lgap due to different resonance frequencies (details in Supplementary Note 4B). Optical rectification efficiency increases with the generation length, as expected, since all generation lengths lgap are shorter than corresponding coherence lengths; therefore, the observed increase in the emission amplitude is not limited by phase-matching. The deviation from a quadratic increase of the intensity is well reproduced by taking into account that the resonance frequency decreases for shorter gap lengths (Fig. 2e, details about the simulations are provided in Supplementary Note 4B).\nIn a second experiment, we demonstrate the potential of distributed pulse phase matching to achieve full control over the\ntemporal coherence of the emitted THzwaveform at the level of single cycles of oscillation using a serial block. We largely benefit from our ultralow-loss TFLN platform. We fabricate four devices consisting of arrays of one to four antennas (\u03a9res \u223c 180GHz) and record their emission in the timedomain (Fig. 3b\u2013e). We keep lgap = 120\u03bcm below the coherence length for a frequency of 180GHz (lcoh = 178\u03bcm). The pump pulse propagates through the antennas with the group velocity vg = c0 ng\n(ng = 2.33) and triggers them consecutively. The spacing between antennas (\u03b4L) sets the time delay between the generated THz signals and thereby their resulting superposition in the farfield. Here, a \u03b4L = 710\u03bcmbetween two successive antennas corresponds to a group delay that matches one single THz cycle at its peak resonance, resulting in a phase-matched emission at a normal exit angle from the chip.

The distance between the antennas measures \u03b4L = 710\u03bcm in all cases leading to a phase-shift of 2\u03c0 and constructive interference\nof the THz pulses in the farfield. f Spectral intensity of 4 subsequent antennas compared to a single one. Resonance narrowing of the emitted THz frequency at 183GHz from a full-width half maximum of 59 GHz to 36 GHz was observed. The device with 4-antennas exhibits THz emission suppression between the fundamental at 183GHz and the first harmonic at 363GHz due to additional periodic phase coherence condition imposed by the linear array. Both spectra are normalized to their respective peak intensity. The insets show opticalmicroscope pictures of the serial block devices.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:11 5\nnumber of oscillation cycles and modified temporal coherence, as shown in Fig. 3b\u2013e. The device with four serial antenna exhibits a ~40% narrower linewidth of the spectral intensity around the fundamental resonance frequency (Fig. 3f). The second peak in the spectrum (n = 2, 360GHz) corresponds to the secondharmonic, since the serial block is phase matched for any nth harmonic of the fundamental THz frequency (due to a phase delay of 2\u03c0n), and thereby also for the second harmonic.\nFinally, wedemonstrate the ability to engineer the temporal phase characteristics (a phase-shift of \u03c0/2 and a phase flip) of a waveform on sub-THz-cycle scales by a parallel block in Fig. 4. In the frequency domain, this opens up the possibility to synthesize narrow band radiation characterizedwith quality factors that cannot be achieved by the single bow-tie antennas. Two pumping pulses are split to individually trigger two antennas. The difference in their arrival at the antennas determines the time delay between the two emitted THz signals.We analyze two scenarios that correspond to in-phase and outof-phase emission of THz pulses (Fig. 4a). We trigger the two antennas simultaneously (zero relative group delay) and then with a \u03c0 phase difference. We demonstrate that out-of-phase time-traces exhibit a phase shift of \u03c0/2 after half a THz cycle and a phase flip of \u03c0 after one full cycle compared to the in-phase scenario (Fig. 4b, c). For the inphase configuration, the Fourier transform of the time-domain signal\nreveals a bright mode around the resonance frequency (Fig. 4d). On the other hand, the phase change for the out-of-phase geometry manifests itself as a suppression in the emission leading to the creation of a dark mode in the farfield at 320GHz (Fig. 4e). This allows us to achieve narrow-band radiation around 250 and 390GHz, with quality factors of Q = 4.5 and Q = 9.3, respectively. Compared to the bare emission of bow-tie antennas which has a Q = 2.8, this demonstrates our ability to also synthesize narrow-band radiation with this approach."

The combination of existing integrated components together with our proposed antenna schemeenables unprecedented flexibility to take control over almost all degrees of freedomof generated THz pulses fromone single platform. We engineer their temporal, spectral, phase, coherence and farfield properties by various basic blocks. This could open up opportunities in the realization of high-performance and versatile THz synthesizers.

Antenna\u2019s relative displacement \u03b4L sets the phase relationship between the emitted THz pulses out-of-plane (inphase or out-of-phase). The interference of these pulses determines the temporal shape of the farfield. b, c Temporal electric field evolution emitted by two in-phase antennas (\u03b4L =0\u03bcm) and by two out-of-phase antennas (\u03b4L = 130\u03bcm, corresponding to half a THz cycle \u03b4L= c0ng TTHz 2 or a phase delay of \u03c0). All antennas have an antenna length of Lant = 90 \u03bcm and a gap length of lgap = 60\u03bcm. The out-of-phase configuration displays different temporal phase properties than the in-phase configuration: at 5.5 ps, the phase of the two waveforms is identical, at 6.7 ps the phase\ndifference is \u03c0/2 and at 8.1 ps the phase difference is \u03c0. As highlighted by the vertical dashed lines, this phase engineering occurs on sub-THz cycle scales of the time-trace. d, e Spectral intensities corresponding to the time-traces shown in plot a and b are retrieved by Fourier transform. For the in-phase emission, one broad peak with a quality factor of Q= \u03a9peak\u0394\u03a9 = 2:8 occurs. \u0394\u03a9 is defined as the full width at half maximum spectral intensity around the particular peak angular frequency \u03c9peak. For the out-of-phase emission, the phase-delay of \u03c0 at the resonance frequency leads to a suppression of the amplitude and two narrow peaks of higher quality factors Q = 4.5 and Q = 9.3. The insets show optical microscope images of the in-phase and out-of-phase devices.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:11 6\nGigahertz. Engineering the antenna geometrywill allow further control of the THz properties, e.g., the generation of different polarization states (corresponding simulations are provided in Supplementary Note 4C). While the current intensity of THz pulses is limited by the pump pulse energy, we provide an extensive discussion in Supplementary Note 7 that showcases possible approaches to increase the magnitude of the emitted terahertz field. By numerically solving the nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation, we find that the pump pulse energy may be increased up to 100 nJ without significantly suffering from selfphase modulation effects at generated frequencies below 500GHz (Supplementary Note 3B). Also, the control of the exact waveguide dispersion by the geometry of the waveguides may be explored to achieve pulse compression and Fourier-limited pump pulses locally in the generation region, potentially increasing the generation efficiency and the spectral bandwidth of the signal generated by optical rectification up to several THz46. The concept of distributed pulse phase matching may be further explored in combination with periodic poling47\u201350 and group delay engineering to synthesize arbitrary patterns of THz radiation by decomposition into temporal modes51. Here, pump pulses at other frequencies than the telecom may also be considered toward improved confinement of the probe and terahertz beam, e.g., at wavelengths of titanium sapphire lasers. Finally, we note that LN circuits are ideal candidates also for THz metrology12,52 where femtosecond pulses in the near-infrared could enable a sub-cycle resolution of the electric field of THz signals and have already proven resourceful for quantum applications by characterization of quantum states of light through their sub-cycle electric field signatures53,54. As a result, fully integrated detectors may be added to our platform. With the compatibility of chip-scale high-power laserswith TFLN platform55, hand-held, compact time-domain spectroscopy systems may be envisioned for the future56."

The waveguides are defined using negative-tone Hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) (FOx-16) bymeans of Electron-beam lithography under multipass exposure (Elionix F-125). The pattern is then transferred to LN through a physical etching process using Reactive Ion Etching with Ar+ ions. The etch depth target is 300nm to form a ridge waveguide. We further confirm the thickness of the remaining film by means of an optical profiler (Filmetrics). We used a wet chemical process to clean the resist and redeposited material after the physical etching. The chip is annealed, then claddedwith 800 nmof Inductively Coupled Vapor Deposition (ICPCVD) SiO2 followed by a final annealing step57. We then defined the electrodes using a positive-tone polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) A9 series (ELS-HS50). To avoid any misalignment, the same resist was used to etch the ICPCVD SiO2, and themetallic antennas.

A detailed sketch of the characterization setup is provided in Supplementary Note 5A. In short, femtosecond pulses from an erbium-doped fiber laser in the near-infrared are coupled from free space to the chip by grating couplers. The femtosecond pulses act as a pump signal for the THz emitters, and the emitted terahertz signal is collected from the back side (silicon side) of the TFLN chip. Two parabolic mirrors collimate and focus the emitted THz radiation onto a zinc telluride where electro-optic sampling enables the measurement of the entire temporal evolution of the emitted THz field. The probe signal at 780 nm originates from the same laser oscillator as the pump signal at\n1560 nm, allowing for coherent detection of the emitted radiation. The 780nm probing pulse overlaps spatially with the focus of the THz beam inside a nonlinear zinc telluride crystal. The interaction between THz andprobefield results in a polarization changeof theprobebeam, which is measured in a balanced detection scheme."
