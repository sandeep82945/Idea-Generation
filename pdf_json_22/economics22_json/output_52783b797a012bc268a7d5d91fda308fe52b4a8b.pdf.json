    "abstractText": "An important form of human learning and cognition is imitation. In environments where uncertainty is more incremental, imitation of peers is a natural response to uncertainty. While there are substantial literature documenting peer effects in other settings, the study of peer effects in working capital management is novel; little research exists on peer effects in working capital management and their impact mechanism. Using data of China\u2019s listed firms from 2010 to 2021, we empirically demonstrate significant peer effects due to working capital management. Firstly, we find that the behavior of working capital management of firms in the same industry is positively related to a firm\u2019s working capital management. We used peer firms\u2019 target debt ratio as an instrumental variable to address potential endogeneity problem. Secondly, the moderating effects test shows that the positive relationship between the behavior of working capital management of firms in the same industry and a firm\u2019s working capital management behavior is moderated by knowledge flow. Meanwhile, the peer effects in the high group of knowledge flow are greater than that of in the low group of knowledge flow. The study is based on the Active Intermodal Matching theory of psychology. It enriches the research findings on the moderating effect of peer effects and has important implications for policymaking to stimulate the economy.",

(1961). Psychological group selection theory suggests that small groups of trust and cooperation are the basic, universal, form of sociality in the networks of usual cooperators. In the social network in which firms are embedded, the circle of peers is often one of the small groups. In dire straits, peer support seems to be\u00a0clearly an advantage (Acedo-Carmona and Gomila, 2015).

Many studies have shown that there are significant peer effects in a firm\u2019s investment behaviors (Brunner and Ostermaier, 2019), financing decision-making (Leary and Roberts, 2014), stock divisions (Adhikari and Agrawal, 2018) and tax avoidance (Gao et\u00a0al., 2021). While there are substantial literature documenting peer effects in other settings, the study of peer effects in working capital management remains largely unexplored in the literature; little research exists on peer effects in working capital management and their impact mechanism. In this study, we\u00a0investigate the role of peer effects in working capital management.\nMany psychological theories have envisaged the combination of behavior parameters to explain the imitation behavior, but there is no way to put the brain\u2019s consciousness into the parameter model, resulting in the lack of ability to explain the imitation behavior, so the AIM (Active Intermodal Matching) model was created. AIM theory proposes that the macro state of imitation consciousness can be\u00a0explained by three parameters. The first parameter is A. Parameter A indicates information processing capacity. When the value of parameter A value is low, people have little ability to process information, their brains are in a coma, and people are unconscious. When the value of parameter A is high, people have great ability to process information and their brains are awake. The second parameter is I. The parameter I\u00a0indicates the information source. When the value of parameter I\u00a0is low, it indicates that the channel for information exchange is closed. At this time, people only pay attention to the information generated within the brain system. When the value of parameter I\u00a0is high, it indicates that the information exchange channel is opened, and people pay attention to the information exchanged between the system and the outside world. The third parameter is M. The parameter M represents the chemical pattern that controls the brain. The significance of AIM model is that in the study of imitation consciousness, two groups of variables with different properties need to be\u00a0involved each time. One is the variable of behaviorism method, and the other is the variable that can only be\u00a0understood through human thinking (Hobson et\u00a0al., 2000). The \u201cidea\u201d of an action can be\u00a0awakened by perceiving the action, action imitation is therefore a natural by-product of action perception (Prinz et\u00a0al., 2009). The AIM theory of psychology has held that imitation is intentional or goal-directed and the goal is to achieve a match between perceived and executed actions (Meltzoff, 2010).\nImitation is shown not only in the presentation of behavior, but also in psychological speculation and simulation (Meltzoff, 2007). When there is a shortage of funds for long-term investment activities such as fixed asset investment and innovation investment, firms can allocate their working capital investment to long-term investment projects to ensure that the projects are carried out smoothly and continuously because of the advantages of lower adjustment cost and easy realization to avoid the cost loss\nfrom frequent adjustment of fixed capital (Ding et\u00a0 al., 2013). Therefore, when peer firms change their working capital allocation decisions to cope with market shocks and gain sustainable development, the firms begin redesigning their working capital holdings, and this behavioral imitation is of two types: (1) information transmitted through previous communication channels between the prior adopter and the firm; and (2) information inferred from the results of the actions of industry pioneers (Reppenhagen, 2010). Research on the social influence of psychology suggests that there are a variety of different mechanisms that promote the diffusion of behavior (Bikhchandani et\u00a0al., 1992). Some of mechanisms are economically rational, while others are driven by human psychology. The social norms interpretation of behavioral imitation suggests that when individuals identify with a social group, the behavior of others in that social group has a greater influence on the social norms of the observer. Such behavior can also be\u00a0 observed in firms. For example, the perceptions of subordinate managers can be\u00a0influenced by their superiors\u2019 evaluation styles.\nDue to the existence of information asymmetry in the market, imitation of peers is a natural response to uncertainty (Lieberman and Asaba, 2006). Compared to developed Western countries, working capital management in China is relatively weak, and the influence of cultural embeddedness and informal institutions on economic activities is much more prevalent and profound in China than in the West, suggesting that Chinese firms are more likely to be\u00a0influenced by other firms\u2019 working capital management approaches when they undertake working capital management. Many supermarkets have seen the success of Wal-Mart in the U.S. in using the OPEM financing model to obtain funds for global expansion, and supermarkets of a certain size in China have copied the model, with some firms achieving success, such as Gome, and others failing, such as Suning. Do the similar working capital management patterns of these listed firms imply the existence of peer effects? If so, what the mechanisms work? The existing literature does not provide a reasonable explanation for these questions.\nThis study investigates the industry peer effects of firms\u2019 working capital management using a sample of non-financial firms listed in Chinese A-shares from 2010 to 2021. This study finds that there is an industry peer effect in the working capital management of listed firms, and the working capital management decisions are significantly and positively influenced by firms in the same industry; the formation mechanism of the peer effects is empirically tested, and the moderating effect of knowledge flow is verified.\nThe possible marginal contributions of the study are: Firstly, based on the theory of AIM in psychology, the study expands the research on working capital management theory considering the moderating effect of knowledge flow. Secondly, although the international psychological community has recently begun to pay attention to the peer effect of accounting behavior, the literature is still small and limited to the existence test of peer effects of accounting behavior, and there is a lack of consensus and rigorous\nFrontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org\nempirical test on the formation mechanism of peer effects. This study empirically demonstrates knowledge flow as a mechanism of peer effects in working capital management and conducts a rigorous empirical test of it, which will enrich the theoretical findings of peer effects."

            "text": "Peer influence was defined as getting a balance between being oneself and conforming to group behavior (Hou et\u00a0 al., 2021). Working capital holding acts as a buffer against unexpected shocks to investment (Ben-Nasr, 2016), but there is an optimal threshold for its holding, and a reasonable amount of working capital can contribute to the improvement of corporate performance as well as the increase of value (Kieschnick et\u00a0al., 2013). If the firm holds too much working capital, although it can meet the liquidity needs of the firm, it will reduce the return on assets of the firm because of its low return; if the firm holds too little working capital, the firm will incur the risk of capital chain breakage. The firm needs to make a trade-off between profitability and liquidity to determine the optimal level of working capital investment (Ba\u00f1osCaballero et\u00a0al., 2013).\nDecision-making is a complicated process that includes various neural and psychological activities (Jin et\u00a0al., 2017). How to determine the appropriate working capital holdings? Firms can make decisions either through rational calculations based on their own realities or by imitating the results of behaviors that other firms have implemented. Early research explained the convergence of corporate accounting behavior as an imitative strategy due to weak financial management skills or conservative managers facing decision ambiguity, and attributed this herding behavior of abandoning private information to the role of signaling mechanisms (Manski, 2000). In recent years, with the introduction of peer theory in social psychology, researchers have found that the influence among firms in the same industry is complex and that managers make merger and acquisition decisions (Shue, 2013), investment decisions (Foucault and Fresard, 2014; Leary and Roberts, 2014), and surplus management (Jackson et\u00a0 al., 2017), among other Financial decisions may be\u00a0made either by directly imitating the results of decision making of peer firms or by updating the results of their own decision basis after learning knowledge of the financial behavior of other firms in the same industry.\nIn the face of economic downturn and uncertainty, imitating similar factors of peers can partially replace rational calculation factors, and the extent to which firms make decisions based on reference peers shows a positive relationship with the degree of uncertainty (Abrahamson and Rosenkopf, 1997). In the prospectuses published in China, many prospectuses benchmark the working capital management indicators of peers as a basis for\njudging the reasonableness of firms\u2019 working capital holdings. Firms are often faced with uncertainty when making decisions. Logically, firms can reduce the uncertainty of their decisions by imitating the working capital management behavior of other peer firms (Haunschild, 1993). In inter-firm imitation activities, large firms that perform better and are more efficient are more likely to be\u00a0the targets of imitation and are imitated to a greater extent. While firms are influenced by peer firms when making decisions about working capital holdings, they do not imitate mechanically, but decide on specific imitation strategies by observing information obtained from peer firms\u2019 financial statements and other information sources. Accounting information disclosed by peer firms has incremental value and good predictive power for future revenues, working capital management ability, financial distress and bankruptcy risk, and their disclosures have positive spillover effects on users of accounting statements (Durnev and Mangen, 2020). The sales revenue and capital expenditure voluntarily disclosed by peer firms in accounting statements can help managers reading the statements to make more accurate estimates of market demand and supply conditions, gain timely insight into potential investment opportunities, reduce uncertainty about future cash flows of investment projects, and thus make better decisions (Bonsall IV et\u00a0al., 2013).\nOver-holding of working capital can lead to missed opportunities for mergers and acquisitions and lost opportunities to explore new markets, thus damaging the value of the firm, and reallocation of inefficiently allocated assets can improve the firm\u2019s share price and its performance in the later years (Denis and Kruse, 2000). Since firms in the same industry face a similar market environment and are highly comparable, the experience of each other is more meaningful for the working capital decision, therefore, when making the decision on working capital holdings, listed firms are likely to obtain information from firms in the same industry and use the working capital management indexes of their peers as a reference, choose a higher working capital holding than their peers, and wait for a higher payout. The impact of peer firms\u2019 financing decisions on other firms is more prominent than any other observable factor (Leary and Roberts, 2014). When firms observe that the working capital holdings of other peer firms can generally increase firm value, they will likely be\u00a0more willing to imitate their peers by holding higher levels of working capital than peer firms; conversely, if they observe that the amount of working capital held by peer firms generally yields poorer performance, they will be\u00a0less willing to imitate.\nAnother reason why firms are influenced by peer firms is spillover correlation, which means that prior adoption may change the net benefit of a later adopter\u2019s decision. For example, prior adoption by an industry competitor will increase the likelihood that the firm will make a similar decision (Francis and Michas, 2013). Firms in the same industry with similar business activities are natural peers, as they face the same business environment, and perhaps, might be\u00a0 followed by the same media and financial analysts. Firms in the same industry are regularly compared by financial analysts and creditors. Since firms in the same industry\nFrontiers in Psychology 04 frontiersin.org\nare in a similar environment, they may choose the same similar accounting practices, such as identical mechanisms of earnings management (Kedia et\u00a0al., 2015). Therefore, in the current study, hypothesis 1 is proposed, as follows:\nH1: working capital management has peer effects; that is, the behavior of working capital management of firms in the same industry is positively related to a firm\u2019s working capital management.\nThe moderating effect of knowledge flow\nThe AIM model of psychology can explain that the imitation consciousness depends on the second parameter I\u00a0 and the combination of I\u00a0and the other two parameters A and M. The brain is always receiving internal and external information. Only when it is aware of the objective existence of the external world can the brain repeatedly identify the reliability of external information and compare it with internal information to know what external information represents. However, what makes the brain aware of the existence of the external world? This can only be\u00a0known through introspection and speculation (Hobson et\u00a0al., 2000). The AIM model is beneficial for working capital management that firms\u2019 manager should open the channels of knowledge flow. Knowledge flow can enhance the thinking ability of firm managers, enable them to better cope with the market competition of firms, and help them attain better performance for firms (Zhou and Caroline Bingxin, 2012).\nKnowledge flow is one of the many \u201cflows\u201d such as capital flow and logistics, and it is particularly important for firms in the era of intellectual capital and human capital, and it has become a trend to integrate knowledge flow into enterprise supply chain management in order to realize firms\u2019 value. Inter-firm competition leads to the flow of knowledge within the network, and imitative competition among neighboring firms has the most direct and intense impact on firm behavior and performance (Gnyawali and Madhavan, 2001). The former refers to imitation behavior in which firms are motivated to obtain information valuable for decision making through imitation and learning, while the latter refers to firms\u2019 imitation of their competitors in response to competitive needs. Both types of model behavior are premised on the flow of knowledge. Knowledge flows are knowledge exchanges and interactions among members of social networks driven by motives such as interest or innovation, and mainly include knowledge transfer, sharing, integration, learning, and utilization (Khelladi et\u00a0al., 2022). From the learning psychology perspective, it is an effective way for entrepreneurs to quickly acquire and accumulate experience through knowledge flow and to do so faster than through their own experiential learning (Baum et\u00a0al., 2000). Knowledge flows include both symbolic and coded explicit knowledge flows such as joint ventures, alliances and\ncontractual transactions, and tacit knowledge flows such as culturally embedded experiences and insights (Von Krogh and Geilinger, 2014). In the process of working capital management, explicit knowledge includes visualized or textualized knowledge such as various financial periodic reports, securities analysts\u2019 reports, stock exchange prospectuses, and various inquiry letters. The flow of such knowledge is usually flowed and acquired by means of online materials. On the other hand, tacit knowledge is mainly hidden in the management experience, decisionmaking judgment and management methods of key management or technical personnel themselves, and its flow mainly relies on informal ways such as face-to-face communication. Knowledge always develops and improves according to the continuous development from tacit to explicit, generating new explicit knowledge from old explicit knowledge, and then turning to new tacit knowledge that is more conducive to enterprise innovation (Azan et\u00a0al., 2017).\nEssentially, the core of the working capital holding decision is the process of weighing the impact of working capital holding on the value creation and risk level of the firm, and the optimal level of working capital holding should be\u00a0the level at which the firm\u2019s value is maximized and the financial risk is minimized. In the real environment, due to differences in individual firm characteristics and external frictions, the firm\u2019s working capital tends to deviate from the optimal level and is constantly adjusted. The determination of the optimal level is a difficult problem (Ba\u00f1osCaballero et\u00a0al., 2013). According to the knowledge flow theory, accounting information disclosed by peer firms can help firms preparing investment decisions to reduce investment uncertainty, especially when this firm is subject to common needs with the firm disclosing the information. The financial statements, management discussion and analysis disclosed in the annual reports of listed firms have high reference value for information user. The forward-looking letter of reports analyses the future business performance, development strategies and business policies of firms. The positive tone of management discussion and analysis in the reports may imply optimistic judgments about the future, which will change the information set of readers and affects the behavior of their investment decisions (Roychowdhury et\u00a0al., 2019). Of course, if peer firms\u2019 disclosures are truthful, their disclosures can generate positive externalities for the firms concerned, but negative externalities can also arise if peer firms misrepresent their performance.\nChanges in resource operations and investment and financing decisions of peer competitors can put pressure on firms, forcing them to maintain a high level of innovation sensitivity, proactively absorb new knowledge, and adopt self-regulation and absorption of external knowledge to converge themselves with leading firms (Hoffmann et\u00a0al., 2018). The flow of knowledge increases financial reporting transparency and reduces adverse selection behavior of corporate managers, thus reducing the cost of capital, enabling efficient resource allocation by increasing total factor productivity, keeping working capital in line with peers, and allocating more capital to higher-yielding projects such as innovation investments,\nFrontiers in Psychology 05 frontiersin.org\nthus enabling the follower firms to benefit from competition (Hashmi, 2013). The increasing quality of regulatory supervision of financial and non-financial information has improved the quality of information disclosure of peer firms and increased the comparability and relevance of information. This knowledge flow will enable firms to keep abreast of the capital allocation status of their peers and reduce the allocation of working capital with low yields in a timely manner. In addition, with the advancement of computer text analysis technology, the textual characteristics of non-financial information can be\u00a0 better portrayed, providing information users with incremental knowledge that was not available through previous channels, and providing feasible technical support for peers to learn from the accessibility of non-financial information disclosed mainly in textual form (Yuan et\u00a0al., 2022). The availability of big data and sophisticated data analytics tools increases access to knowledge of peer working capital decisions. With the increase of knowledge, managers have reduced the investment decision-making errors caused by behavioral biases such as overconfidence, limited attention span, loss aversion and misjudgment. Sensible managers do not allocate capital to working capital that does not yield high returns (Baker and Wurgler, 2013). Based on this argument it can be\u00a0reasonably inferred that the knowledge flow among peers can reduce managers\u2019 uncertainty about their own firm\u2019s growth opportunities, increase the allocation of higher-yielding longterm investments and reduce the allocation of lower-yielding working capital. Therefore, hypothesis 2 is proposed, as follows:\nH2: The positive relationship between the behavior of working capital management of firms in the same industry and a firm\u2019s working capital management behavior is moderated by knowledge flow."

Following the study of Iqbal and Zhuquan (2015), working capital is defined as the value of NWC calculated in Table\u00a01 and divided by total assets to eliminate the size effect; another measure of working capital is the method of Ba\u00f1os-Caballero et\u00a0 al.

Secondly, target debt ratio meets the correlation assumption of instrumental variables, where the target debt ratio is correlated with the peer firms\u2019 working capital allocation. Table\u00a04 shows the outcomes of instrumental variables tests. In Model 4, the outcomes of the first stage indicates that peertr is significantly negatively correlated with peerNWC.

The number of citations or citations of patent and non-IP documents are often used by scholars to measure knowledge flow because of their tangible and traceable knowledge flow relationship, but they are mainly used to reflect the flow trajectory of explicit knowledge and cannot reflect the flow of tacit knowledge (Wu and Mathews, 2012). Further, some scholars compute the number of clicks on patents, brands and publications of Baidu and Google search engine firms to reflect the firms\u2019 knowledge flow. However, due to the current trend of mobile applications to replace computer search engines, the accuracy of this indicator is questioned. Regardless of the above-mentioned methods, it is impossible to make accurate measurement of knowledge flow intensity. It is especially important to choose appropriate methods in the face of different application research purposes and scenarios, especially to combine subjective and objective methods to jointly evaluate Knowledge Flow intensity from multiple perspectives. According to the efficient market theory, all information and knowledge flow are fully or partially reflected in the stock price, and the stock idiosyncratic return is a suitable metric for knowledge flow. Referring to the study of Liu et\u00a0al. (2019), the intensity of the KF is computed as follows:\nKF rfind peer it ijt M t M t ijt ijt t ijtrf= + -( ) + -( ) +a b g b g e (3)\nwhere the indices i, j, and t correspond to firm, region, and month, respectively. g M denotes the market rate of return, g peer denotes the peer firms\u2019 stock yield. rft denotes the risk-free rate of return. The specific computing steps are as follows: Firstly, at the beginning of each year, the monthly data of the industry for the previous 36 months are used to regress Equation (3), and the corresponding coefficient values are calculated. The regression coefficients at the beginning of the year are used to calculate the expected value of corporate stock returns for each month, and the actual stock returns for each month are subtracted from the expected stock returns to obtain the volatility of corporate stock returns for each month, i.e., the firm stock idiosyncratic returns for each month in the year. Secondly, the arithmetic mean of the firm\u2019s stock idiosyncratic return for each month of the year is calculated to obtain the annual firms\u2019 stock idiosyncratic return. Thirdly, the average annual stock idiosyncratic return of other firms in the same industry is calculated and used as a proxy variable for knowledge flow in the study.\nModel 6 is developed to test the hypothesis (H2). We\u00a0added knowledge flow (KF) as a moderator variable to our Model 6. The coefficient of KF is also positively significant with the peerNWC in Model 6 (t\u00a0= 5.071, p\u00a0< 0.01). When we\u00a0 implement our full interaction models peerNWC \u00d7 KF, the coefficient is positively significant with the peerNWC in Model 6 and supports H2 (t\u00a0= 3.316, p\u00a0< 0.01). The results confirm that knowledge flow acts as a moderator. The economic implications of this outcome indicate that knowledge flow has an enhanced relationship\nbetween the behavior of working capital management of firms in the same industry and a firm\u2019s working capital management behavior. In other words, the stronger the knowledge mobility is, the more firms and peers communicate is, the greater the amount of information acquired is, and the more significant the peer effects is.\nMoreover, to further explain the moderating effect of knowledge flows, the research samples are divided into two subsamples, including the low group of knowledge flow and the high group of knowledge flow. We\u00a0define the sample group with knowledge flow greater than the industry median as the high group of knowledge flow and the sample group with knowledge flow lower than the industry median as the low group of knowledge flow. The value of the high group is coded \u201c1,\u201d otherwise it is coded \u201c0.\u201d This study still uses the empirical model constructed by Equation (2), and the regression outcomes are reported in Table\u00a05.\nIn the two subsamples of low group and high group, the regression results can be\u00a0seen in Model 7 and Model 8 of Table\u00a05: in the low group of knowledge flow, the coefficient of moderating effect is 0.843, which is significant at the level under 1%; in the high group of knowledge flow, the coefficient of peer effects is 0.985, which is significant at the level under 1%. In the study, after doing a mean comparison test for the difference in coefficients between groups, the results show that the difference in means is significant at the 1% level. This indicates that the difference in coefficients between the two groups is comparable. This also suggests that the moderating effect of knowledge flow in the high group of knowledge flow are greater than that of in the low group of knowledge flow, explaining the paradox of why the full sample knowledge flow has a negative effect on the peer effects. In the high group of knowledge flow, the correlation coefficient of ROA for the financial characteristics of the group of firms is significantly different from zero, indicating that a firm adjusted their working capital management by imitating and learning the financial characteristics of peer firms.\nThe peer effects of working capital management consist of three components: subject, the imitated behavior and environment. Among them, the imitation ability of imitators in the subject determines the effective implementation of the imitated behavior. Firstly, from the perspective of the imitated, their high working capital allocation ratio indicates a lack of confidence in the future and an increased incentive to prevent saving; a low working capital allocation ratio indicates that the firm mainly relies on long-term investment layout to support its development and is confident in the future. Therefore, the working capital allocation behavior of industry leaders is significant for industry followers and can attract them to imitate it. For industry followers, the uncertainty of economic policies can significantly increase the loan cost of firms in the process of GDP downturn. By imitating and learning to adjust their working capital and longterm capital structure, firms can not only reduce the financing cost, but also effectively reduce the financial risk caused by investment misjudgment.\nFrontiers in Psychology 10 frontiersin.org\nSecondly, in terms of imitators, it is generally small firms that imitate large firms, and few large firms imitate small firms. The imitation behavior reflects management\u2019s risk preference in the investment process (Zhou and Xu, 2019). The lower the risktaking level of management is, the weaker the risk appetite will be, and the more liquid assets such as trading financial assets will\nbe\u00a0allocated. The more stable the working capital decisions of firms become, the stronger the need for managers to refer to similar decisions of peer firms. The more obvious the peer effect of working capital management is, the stronger the ability of imitating other firms to allocate assets is.\nThirdly, working capital allocation decisions are not only determined by the internal resources and capabilities of firms, but also closely related to the external macro environment. The environment of knowledge flow will affect the firms\u2019 ability to adjust long- and short-term capital structure. In addition, the rise and fall of the industry will also affect the demand for working capital of firms, and thus affect the willingness and direction of firms\u2019 working capital adjustment."

Secondly, the amount of corporate working capital allocation increases with the increase of peer firms\u2019 working capital allocation. Thirdly, the peer effect of working capital works through the channel of knowledge flow, and the peer effects in the high group of knowledge flow are greater than that of in the low group of knowledge flow."

Firstly, it verifies the existence of the peer effects of working capital allocation decisions and analyzes the mechanism of the peer effects of working capital decisions qualitatively through the channel of knowledge flow. It is different from most of the prior study that only analyzes the peer effect through the mechanism of imitation and learning. It answers the question, \u201cWhat channels do firms learn from their peers?\u201d\nSecondly, it conducts a rigorous empirical test of knowledge flow as a mechanism of peer effects in working capital management, which will enrich the international research on accounting behavior and provide a reference for other studies on the peer effects of accounting behavior."

Since 2020, the COVID-19 epidemic has increased the economic uncertainty and the operating risks of firms. The firms\u2019 managers have been exploring possible pathways to manage and overcome financial distress and crisis. The practical significance of peer effects is to guide managers to respond to the crisis by imitating the excellent firm behavior of peers. Thus, the firm should take steps to increase its imitation capabilities. For example, as the top financial officer of the firm, the CFO should pay greater attention to peers\u2019 activities and behaviors.\nSecondly, working capital holdings are negatively correlated with the net profit margin of peer assets, indicating that to obtain higher profit margins, working capital holdings must be\u00a0reduced, but working capital is closely related to operating cash flow, and the timing and amount of operating cash flow is uncertain, as well as the mismatch between cash inflows and outflows in time, making the firm often have a cash flow gap, which increases the firm\u2019s inability to timely repay debt. This increases the risk that the firm will not be\u00a0able to pay its debts on time. The solution to this dilemma is to accelerate working capital turnover and support as much operating income with as little working capital as possible in order to keep the firm free from solvency risk.\nThirdly, knowledge flow among peer firms is an important channel to transfer information. Information acquisition not only comes from the financial characteristics of peers, but also from information outside the peer firms. The government has more information advantages than firms, and should establish an effective information disclosure platform to regularly provide true and reliable investment information. At the same time, the government should communicate and exchange investment information policies with firms in a timely manner to enable firms to obtain more comprehensive information, so that firms improve the quality and efficiency of working capital management."
