    "abstractText": "Fiber aggregation in nanocomposites has an important effect on macroscopic electrical performance. To quantitatively evaluate its effect, an index to characterize the degree of aggregation is imperative and, ideally, it should have three features simultaneously, i.e., (1) single-parametric, dimensionless, and physically meaningful, (2) applicable to different aggregation topologies, and (3) one-to-one, corresponding to material electrical properties. However, these features remain largely unexplored. Here, we propose a new aggregation degree that is defined as the average increment of the fiber number connecting with each one when fibers aggregate from a uniform distribution state. This index is applicable to different aggregation topologies, from lump-like to network-like aggregating clusters. By geometric probability analysis and numerical validations, we demonstrate the index can be concisely expressed by the characteristic parameters of the aggregating cluster since it only depends on the local features. Interestingly, a one-to-one linear relation between the aggregation degree and the percolation threshold is found, which is independent of the distribution law of the fibers. This work may provide a guide to the property characterization, performance prediction, and material design of nanocomposites, and give physical insight into the understanding of systems with similar non-uniform distributions.",

            "text": "Nanofiber-reinforced composites have extensive applications in many fields, e.g., antennas and solar sails for spacecraft [1], flexible wearable electronics [2], high-efficiency solar cells [3], highly sensitive sensors [4], and conductive coatings for lightning strike protection and electromagnetic interference shielding [5] due to excellent physical, chemical and mechanical properties [6], such as being light-weight, having a high specific stiffness and specific strength, a high electrical/thermal conductivity, and transparency. The spatial dispersion state of the fibers in the matrix is a core feature of composites in addition to the intrinsic properties of fibers, such as aspect ratio [7,8] and curliness [9], and plays an important role in tuning the macro properties [10,11]. Generally, increasing the uniformity of the dispersion of fibers would improve the material properties related to the connectivity of the fiber network [7,12,13]. For example, fibers with higher uniformity of dispersion are easier to construct a connecting pathway spanning through the whole materials for conducting electricity, transferring heat, and carrying a load, leading to a lower percolation threshold [14]. However, even when the dispersion state can be improved by using mechanical methods [15] (e.g., sonication, ball milling, and shear mixing) or chemical methods [16] (e.g., surfactants and functionalization methods), re-aggregation of fillers in the subsequent processing (e.g., curing processing) may occur due to the entanglement and interaction between the fillers [7,11,17,18]. Although aggregation could slightly facilitate local electron transfer by enhancing fiber-to-fiber contact [19\u201321], it can reduce the global connectivity of fiber networks and thus increase the percolation threshold, significantly\nMaterials 2023, 16, 15. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma16010015 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2023, 16, 15 2 of 17\ndegrading the electrical property of composites [7,12,22\u201325]. Therefore, the effect of fiber aggregation on composite properties is crucial and should be carefully treated in the process of material design and manufacturing. Before investigating the effect of fiber aggregation on composite properties, it is imperative to quantitatively evaluate the degree of aggregation. The microstructure of nanofibers in composites usually can be characterized by microscopies and image analysis. It is observed that the nanofibers can aggregate into lump-like clusters [19,26,27] or networklike structures with the boundaries of clusters overlapped [28], with different fabrication techniques. When the degree of aggregation is relatively high, the aggregating clusters can be distinguished clearly in the microscopic images, and thus the degree of aggregation usually can be evaluated by the features of aggregating clusters. One of the widely used characterizing methods for the degree of aggregation is based on two indices [17,26], e.g., the variations of location and the size of aggregating clusters. A typical example is the quadrat method based on image processing. With a preliminary grid division of the microscopic image of the composite sample, the standard deviation of the clusters\u2019 area per grid, as well as the characteristic parameter of distribution law for the size of clusters, can be abstracted to describe the degree of aggregation [26]. Most of these methods need a division of the sample image in advance. The most noticeable inconvenience of these quadrat methods is that the precision and reliability of the calculation largely depend on the grid size and number of aggregating clusters [17,26]. Although some work has been performed to remove the effect of the grid size and the number of aggregating clusters to obtain reliable results [17], these methods should be used \u201cwith caution\u201d [17,29,30]. Additionally, it is inconvenient to evaluate the overall dispersion quality of samples when using a multi-parameter model, which would lead to a decision with subjectivity [29]. Therefore, some efforts have been made by using measures with a single index [31\u201333], which are based on statistical parameters, such as entropy [31,32] and energy [33]. These indices can quantitatively evaluate the degree of aggregation, but are not easy to obtain due to their complex definitions or mathematics [17]. When the degree of aggregation is relatively small, the nanofibers in the composites present network-like structures, where the boundaries of the aggregating clusters are hard to distinguish due to partial overlap. Therefore, the local features at the level of fibers should be considered to evaluate the degree of aggregation. To this end, some studies have employed multi-level models with the local features of fibers to investigate the electrical property of nanofiber composites, where the aggregating clusters are assumed to have the same size and distribute randomly or regularly in the matrix [7,11,22,23,34,35]. Based on the multi-level model, a typical evaluation for the degree of aggregation is using three indices, i.e., the nominal radius of aggregating clusters, the volume fraction of nanofibers in each aggregating cluster, and the ratio of aggregated nanofibers to the total nanofibers [7,34]. From all the above, it can be found that an evaluation of the degree of aggregation that uses fewer indices and applies to different aggregation topologies remains insufficiently explored. Therefore, this paper aims to establish a simple and universal index to quantify the aggregating state of fibers in nanocomposites and further establish the relationship between this index and the percolation threshold. The results of this work may provide a guide to the property characterization, performance prediction, and material design of nanocomposites, and give physical insight into the understanding of systems with similar non-uniform distributions."

            "text": "An index for characterizing the aggregation degree of nanofiber-reinforced composites should be simple, universal, and easy to characterize the material properties. To achieve this purpose, an ideal aggregation degree should have the following three features, simultaneously.\n1. The aggregation degree should be a single dimensionless index with physical meaning.\nMaterials 2023, 16, 15 3 of 17\n2. The aggregation degree should be applicable to different aggregation topologies, from lump-like aggregating clusters to network-like aggregating clusters. 3. The aggregation degree should have a one-to-one corresponding relation with the electrical property of the composites regardless of the distribution law of fibers.\nTo obtain an index that can have the above features and facilitate the evaluation of the effect of fiber aggregation on the electrical properties of composites (the percolation threshold is focused on in this work), the key point is to find a parameter closely related to the dispersion state of fibers. Meanwhile, this parameter should be able to reflect the feature at the level of fiber, and thus can apply to different aggregation topologies. It is well-known that the distribution state of the fibers can be reflected by the average number of fibers that have interacted with each fiber [36,37], also known as the average intersection number (softcore fiber) or average bond number (hardcore fiber). This number can be derived from the probability of two arbitrary fibers intersecting (softcore fiber) or making contact (hardcore fiber) with each other. Meanwhile, for composites with uniformly distributed fibers, i.e., the center points of fibers distribute evenly in the space and the orientation angles of fibers follow uniform distributions in the ranges of [0, \u03c0), the average interaction number of each fiber is a well-accepted and powerful parameter to theoretically predict the percolation threshold [38,39]. Obviously, when the fibers cannot disperse uniformly in the matrix, the probability for two arbitrary fibers to intersect or contact with each other would change, and the average interaction number on each fiber would also change accordingly. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the aggregation degree is related to the variation quantity of the average interaction number, and is defined as:\n\u03be = Nint \u2212 N R int (1)\nwhere Nint is the average interaction number of fibers with aggregation and N R int is the average interaction number of the same fibers with an assumed uniformly distributed state (i.e., without aggregation). In other words, \u03be is a shifted average interaction number of fibers. It can be seen from the definition that the aggregation degree has the first feature. According to the definition in Equation (1), the aggregation degree of fibers is an index that represents a deviation from an assumed state when the same fibers are uniformly distributed. For fibers with uniform distribution, it equals 0. For simplicity, the softcore fiber model [4,36,37,40] is employed here, where the penetration between fibers is permitted. Therefore, the fibers can intersect with each other, and the average interaction number is the average intersection number. The average intersection number of fibers with uniform distribution in a 2-dimensional (2D) space can be obtained by geometric probability analysis [38] and can be expressed as:\nNRint = p R \u00b7 Nf = 2 \u03c0 l2f L2 Nf (2)\nwhere pR is the probability of two arbitrary fibers intersecting with each other in this case, lf is the length of the fiber, L is the length of squared representative area element (RAE), and the Nf is the number of fibers in this RAE. A detailed derivation of Equation (2) can be found in the previous work [38]. For the model with fiber aggregation, due to the nonsingle-level feature induced by aggregation, it is hard to obtain the average intersection number Nint by conventional geometric probability analysis and, thus, a two-level analysis to calculate the average intersection number will be introduced in Section 2.2."

Schematic diagra s of (a) an aggregating cluster, (b) an RAE with multiple aggregating clusters, and (c) RAEs with different fiber dispersion states.\nFor simplicity, we assumed that all aggregating clusters in an RAE have the same degree of looseness \u03c3 and fiber number Naggf (other distribution laws will be discussed in Section 3.3). Thus, the number of aggregating clusters in an RAE is:\nNagg = Nf\nNaggf . (3)\nMaterials 2023, 16, 15 5 of 17\nIn addition, when the fiber number in each aggregating cluster Naggf is 1, the aggregation model can degrade to the uniform distribution model. Additionally, to evaluate the concentration of the fibers, the relative density is defined as the area fraction of the fibers in an RAE [38], as follows:\n\u03c1 = Nflfdf\nL2 = nfl2f \u03bbf , (4)\nwhere df is the diameter of the fiber, \u03bbf = lf/df is the aspect ratio of the fiber, and nf = Nf/L2 is the number of fibers per unit area. For 2D networks, the diameter effect can be ignored because the aspect ratio of nanofibers is usually sufficiently large (e.g., for carbon nanotubes, the aspect ratio is generally larger than 100 [44,45]), and thus the combined dimensionless parameter nfl2f , which is the average fiber number in the area of lf \u00d7 lf, also can be used to describe the density of fiber network. As shown in Figure 1c, RAEs with various dispersion states of fibers are exhibited. The aggregation degree \u03be of each RAE is calculated by Equation (1), as presented in the labels in Figure 1c. It can be seen intuitively that the fibers with stronger aggregation have a larger value of \u03be. Meanwhile, it also can be found that the aggregation degree has a second feature, i.e., it applies to both lump-like clusters to network-like clusters.\n2.2.2. Intersecting Probability in an Aggregating Cluster\nFirst, to calculate the intersecting probability of two arbitrary fibers in an individual aggregating cluster, a Cartesian coordinate system is introduced whose origin is located at the center of a characteristic circle, as shown in Figure 2a. The intersecting probability of the the two fibers depends on the distance R between the midpoints of the two fibers and the angle \u03b8ij between them. As the distance R decreases, or the angle \u03b8ij approaches \u03c0/2, the intersecting probability increases. Based on geometric probability analysis, the intersecting probability of the two fibers in an aggregating cluster is expressed as:\npagg = x\nG(R, \u03b8ij) \u00b7 f (R) \u00b7 f (\u03b8ij)dRd\u03b8ij, (5)\nwhere f (R) and f (\u03b8ij) are the probability density functions of the distance R and angle \u03b8ij, respectively, and G(R, \u03b8ij) is the intersecting probability of the two fibers with given R and \u03b8ij.

Intersecting Probability in an RAE\nIn this section, the intersecting probability of the two fibers in an RAE is estimated. Obviously, the intersecting probability of two arbitrary fibers in an RAE p is a function of that in an aggregating cluster pagg. To derive the relation between p and pagg, an RAE with two aggregating clusters is taken as an introductory example first. The intersecting probability of the two fibers in this RAE can be written as:\np = 2Nint\nN2f =\n2pagg ( Naggf )2\n+ 2Naddint( 2Naggf )2 , (7) where Nint is the total number of intersections and Naddint is the number of intersections caused by intersecting fibers from two different aggregating clusters. Because the size of an aggregating cluster is typically much smaller than the RAE, the fibers from two different aggregating clusters can hardly intersect with each other. Therefore, the additional intersection number Naddint can be ignored compared to a much larger total intersection number Nint, and then the probability in Equation (7) can be simplified as p \u2248 pagg/2. Therefore, it is intuitive that the intersecting probability must satisfy three special conditions, which are: (1) when Nagg\u2192\u221e, p\u2192pR; (2) when Nagg\u21921, p\u2192pagg/Nagg; and (3) when Nagg = 1, p = pagg. Then, the relation between p and pagg is proposed as:\np = pagg \u2212 pR\nNagg + pR. (8)\nTo validate the function in Equation (8), Monte Carlo simulations are conducted by using RAEs with various parameters to numerically obtain the intersecting probability p. There are three parameters that affect the average intersecting probability, i.e., the degree of looseness \u03c3 and the fiber length lf, and the number of fibers in an aggregating cluster N agg f . Therefore, a comprehensive validation is summarized as shown in Figure 3, which shows a good agreement between the Monte Carlo simulation results and Equation (8). Materials 2023, 16, 15 7 of 18"

The aggregation degree is defined as a dimensionless single index with a straightforward physical meaning. It is the increment of the average intersection numbers of fibers in composites when fibers aggregate from a uniform distribution state. Based on a two-level model with randomly distributed aggregating clusters, we have demonstrated that the aggregation degree applies to different aggregation topologies, from lump-like aggregating clusters to network-like aggregating clusters, and only depends on the local features of the aggregating clusters by both theoretical geometric probability analysis and Monte Carlo simulations. The index can be concisely expressed as a combination of the intersecting probability and fiber numbers in an aggregating cluster. A one-to-one relationship between the aggregation degree and the percolation threshold is found. By using Monte Carlo simulations, the percolation threshold of composites with fiber aggregation is obtained. It is found that the percolation threshold increases monotonously with the increase in the aggregation degree, which can be described by a linear relation. Furthermore, it is proven that this one-to-one linear relation is universally applicable to systems with different distribution laws. The new index for the degree of aggregation and its linear relation with the percolation threshold can not only provide a guide to the property characterization, performance prediction, and material design of nanocomposites, but also give a new physical insight into the understanding of a system with complex randomness.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, B.C., F.P. and Y.C.; Methodology, B.C., F.P., Y.M. and Y.C.; Software, B.C.; Validation, F.P., F.Z. and Y.M.; Investigation, B.C.; Resources, Y.C.; Writing\u2014original draft, B.C.; Writing\u2014review & editing, F.P., B.D. and Y.C.

For a fiber system with isotropically distributed angles, it satisfies the following:\nf (\u03b8ij) = 2 \u03c0 . (A1)\nf (R) is the probability density function of the center-to-center distance between two arbitrary fibers. To solve f (R), assuming the coordinates of the midpoints of the two fibers\nMaterials 2023, 16, 15 12 of 17\nas A(x1, y1) and B(x2, y2), as shown in Figure A1a. Then, the distribution function of the center-to-center distance is:\nF(R) = P (\u221a (x2 \u2212 x1)2 + (y2 \u2212 y1)2 \u2264 R ) = 1\u2212 exp ( \u2212 R24\u03c32 ) R > 0. (A2)\nBy derivation, the probability density function of center-to-center distance can be expressed as:\nf (R) = exp ( \u2212 R24\u03c32 ) \u00b7 R2\u03c32 R > 0. (A3)\nG(R, \u03b8ij) is the intersecting probability of the two fibers with a given angle \u03b8ij and a center-to-center distance R. To obtain this probability, the excluded area method is used [36]. The excluded area is the area around an object where the center of another similarly shaped object cannot enter if penetration is not permitted. Therefore, a necessary and sufficient condition for the two fibers to intersect is that the midpoint of fiber i enters the excluded area of fiber j, and vice versa. As shown in Figure A1, the gray area is the excluded area of fibers i and j. When the center of fiber i moves along a circle with a radius R and enters into the excluded area, these two fibers must intersect each other. Therefore, the intersecting probability G(R, \u03b8ij) is the ratio of the arc length inside the excluded area (the blue arcs in Figure A1a,b) to the entire cycle circumference with a radius R. When the angle between the two fibers is fixed, with the radius R increasing, the analysis of intersecting probability can be divided into four cases, as shown in Figure A1c. Case 1: when 0 < R \u2264 R3, the center of fiber i must locate in the excluded area, which means that the two fibers must intersect. Case 2: when R3 < R \u2264 R2, the circle is cut into eight arcs by the rhombus edges, and four arcs are in the rhombus, as shown in Figure A1b. Case 3: when R2 < R \u2264 R1, the circle is cut into four arcs by the rhombus edges, and two arcs are in the rhombus, as shown in Figure A1a.\nCase 4: when R > R1, the two fibers cannot intersect. Based on geometric analysis, R1 is half of the long diagonal of the rhombus, R2 is the\nhalf of the short diagonal of the rhombus, and R3 is the radius of the inscribed circle of the rhombus. Therefore, R1, R2, and R3 can be written as:\nR1 = \u221a 2 2 lf \u221a 1 + cos \u03b8ij R2 = \u221a 2 2 lf \u221a\n1\u2212 cos \u03b8ij R3 = \u221a 2 2 lf \u221a 1 + cos \u03b8ij sin \u03b8ij 2 . (A4)\nAs mentioned above, the intersecting probability G(R, \u03b8ij) is the ratio of the length of blue arcs to the entire cycle circumference. To measure the length of these blue arcs for case 3 and case 4, a Cartesian coordinate system is introduced with the origin located at a vertex of the acute angle of the rhombus, as shown in Figure A1d,e. Obviously, the ratios of the arc lengths can be equivalent to the ratios of angles. Therefore, the piecewise intersecting probability is:\nG(R, \u03b8ij) =  1 0 \u2264 R \u2264 R3 \u03b1+\u03b2 \u03c0 R3 < R \u2264 R2 \u03b1 \u03c0 R2 < R < R1\n0 R \u2265 R1\n, (A5)\nwhere \u03b1 and \u03b2 are the corresponding angles of blue arcs, and can be expressed as:\n\u03b1 = arccos ( 1\u2212 2y 2 2\nR2 ) \u03b2 = 2arccos ( y1 R ) , (A6)\nMaterials 2023, 16, 15 13 of 17\nwhere\ny1 = R2 ( R21+ \u221a R2R21+R 2R22\u2212R21R 2 2 ) R21+R 2 2\ny2 = R2 ( R21\u2212 \u221a R2R21+R 2R22\u2212R21R 2 2 ) R21+R 2 2 . (A7)\nFinally, according to Equations (5), (A1), (A3) and (A5), the intersecting probability of arbitrary fibers in an aggregating cluster can be rewritten as:\npagg = \u222b \u03c0/2\n0 \u222b R3 0 1 \u03c0 \u00b7 exp ( \u2212 R24\u03c32 ) \u00b7 R \u03c32 dRd\u03b8ij\n+ \u222b \u03c0/2\n0 \u222b R2 R3 \u03b1+\u03b2 \u03c02 \u00b7 exp ( \u2212 R24\u03c32 ) \u00b7 R \u03c32 dRd\u03b8ij\n+ \u222b \u03c0/2\n0 \u222b R1 R2 \u03b1 \u03c02 \u00b7 exp ( \u2212 R24\u03c32 ) \u00b7 R \u03c32 dRd\u03b8ij .

Generation of the 2D Network Models\nIn an RAE with a size of L \u00d7 L, fibers are simplified as line segments with the length lf. For a random network without aggregation, the position of the nanofiber midpoint (x0, y0) and the orientation of the fiber \u03b8 follow uniform distributions in the ranges of [0, L), [0, L), and [0, \u03c0), respectively, and follow the equations as:\nx0i = rand\u00d7 L y0i = rand\u00d7 L \u03b8i = rand\u00d7 \u03c0 , (A9)\nwhere (x0i , y 0 i ) and \u03b8i indicate the midpoint position and the orientation angle of the i-th fiber in the network, respectively, and the \u201crand\u201d is a random number uniformly distributed in the range of [0, 1). For the network with aggregation, the aggregation degree of the networks can be controlled by the degree of looseness \u03c3 and fiber number Naggf in an aggregating cluster. The midpoint positions of Nagg aggregating clusters (xagg, yagg) are assumed to be uniformly distributed in the ranges of [0, L) and [0, L), respectively. The positions of nanofibers in each aggregating cluster are assumed to follow a normal distribution in two perpendicular directions and can be shown as:{\nx0i = x agg j + normrnd(0, \u03c3) y0i = y agg j + normrnd(0, \u03c3) , (A10)\nwhere (xaggj , y agg j ) signifies the midpoint position of the j-th aggregating cluster. The \u201cnormrnd\u201d refers to a random number that conforms to the normal distribution N~(0, \u03c32). The orientation of the fibers \u03b8 still follows uniform distribution in the range of [0, \u03c0).\nThe coordinates of two ends of the i-th nanofiber can be set as:{ x1i x1i } = { x0i x0i } + lf 2 { cos \u03b8i sin \u03b8i } , { x2i x2i } = { x0i x0i } \u2212 lf 2 { cos \u03b8i sin \u03b8i } . (A11)\nAssuming the squared RAE is a periodic section in the whole network, the parts of nanofibers outside the area L \u00d7 L should be moved to the opposite edge of the RAE boundary, as shown in Figure A2, in which the blue line segments are those moved from outside to inside.
