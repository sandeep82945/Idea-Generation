    "abstractText": "While prior literature has largely focused on marriage effects during young adulthood, it is less clear whether these effects are as strong in middle adulthood. Thus, we investigated age differences in marriage effects on problem-drinking reduction. We employed parallel analyses with two independent samples (analytic-sample Ns of 577 and 441, respectively). Both are high-risk samples by design, with about 50% of participants having a parent with lifetime alcohol use disorder. Both samples have been assessed longitudinally from early young adulthood to the mid-to-late 30s. Separate parallel analyses with these two samples allowed evaluation of the reproducibility of results. Growth models of problem drinking tested marriage as a time-varying predictor and thereby assessed age differences in marriage effects. For both samples, results consistently showed marriage effects to be strongest in early young adulthood and to decrease somewhat monotonically thereafter with age, reaching very small (and nonsignificant) magnitudes by the 30s. Results may reflect that role transitions like marriage have more impact on problem drinking in earlier versus later adulthood, thereby highlighting the importance of life span developmental research for understanding problem-drinking desistance. Our findings can inform intervention strategies aimed at reducing problem drinking by jumpstarting or amplifying natural processes of adult role adaptation.",

            "text": "Problem drinking hasmyriad personal, public health, and economic costs (NIAAA, 2020; Sher & Verg\u00e9s, 2016). Normative declines in problem drinking are observed to occur beginning in early young adulthood and continuing throughout the life span (Lee & Sher, 2018; Schulenberg et al., 2019). Despite this age-related trend toward problem-drinking reduction, some individuals exhibit chronic problem drinking well into adulthood. Given this developmental heterogeneity, research should aim to illuminate factors that differentiate developmentally limited versus chronic adulthood problem drinking. Findings can guide intervention strategies from a life span developmental perspective (NIAAA, 2017).\nLife span development and marriage effects\nRobust evidence suggests that family role transitions like marriage and parenthood are important influences on young\u2013adult drinking reductions, including desistance from alcohol use disorder (AUD) (as reviewed by Lee & Sher, 2018). The \u201cmaturing out\u201d literature (O\u2019Malley, 2004) has often interpreted such family role effects through role incompatibility theory (Yamaguchi & Kandel, 1985).\nFor instance, demands of a new marital role may conflict with prior established drinking behaviors, prompting drinking-related reductions to resolve the conflict. In role incompatibility theory, this adaptation to reduce role conflict is termed \u201crole socialization.\u201d\nAs marriage effects are primarily associated with young\u2013adult \u201cmaturing out,\u201d questions remain regarding the extent these effects also occur at later ages. There is reason to suspect that marriage may exert particularly strong influences in young adulthood. Established developmental theory (e.g., Erikson, 1968) views entry into adult roles like marriage to be a key young\u2013adult developmental task. Further, more general arguments have been made that environmental effects on behavior may decrease throughout adulthood as age brings a greater tendency for adults to actively construct their environments to align with personal characteristics (as opposed tomore passively receiving and then reacting/adapting to their environments; Kendler et al., 2007; Scarr & McCartney, 1983). Thus, after young adulthood, there may be a decreased tendency for role socialization whereby individuals enter marriage and then adapt to reduce role conflict. In contrast, there may be an increased tendency for \u201crole selection,\u201d for example, with individuals actively avoiding or pursuing marriage depending on the extent that their personal characteristics (e.g., drinking behaviors) can be expected to cause role conflict.

Such questions align with a broader empirical objective of understanding differences across the adult life span in factors that influence problem-drinking reduction.\nSome past studies of marriage effects on drinking-related reductions have shown weaker, nonsignificant, or even opposite (i.e., risk-conferring) effects at older ages (Bennett et al., 1999; Prescott & Kendler, 2001); others have shown either little evidence of age differences or yielded inconsistent findings (Neve et al., 2000; Temple et al., 1991). Limitations of past studies have included contrasts of broad age groups (e.g., 18\u201339 vs. 40\u00fe), failure to test age moderation, analysis of cross-sectional associations that obscure directionality, and prediction of low severity drinking outcomes with limited clinical relevance.\nTo address these limitations, the current study conducted a focused investigation of age differences in marriage effects with nuanced age contrasts, formal tests of agemoderation, longitudinal analyses of prospective marriage effects, and prediction of an outcome designed to capture both subclinical and clinical variation in problem drinking. Further, we tested this question in two independent samples to internally assess replicability of findings."

Computerized structured interviews assessed DSM-III parental lifetime alcohol abuse or dependence (American Psychiatric Association, 1980; DIS-III; Robins et al., 1981, 1982).

This age binning is a common approach for addressing intrawave age variability in data from an accelerated longitudinal design (Prinzie & Onghena, 2005), and it thereby permitted straightforward tests of age moderation in our SEM-based growth models with time-varying marriage effects.1 Due to younger ages in the first current-study wave of AFDP relative to the first current-study wave of AHB, we retained the youngest age bin of 17\u201320 for AFDP but not AHB (see Table 1 and Supplemental Appendix S1). This decision resulted in exclusion of nine AHB person-observations for participants who were younger than age 21 at the first current-study wave of AHB. We also excluded one AFDP person-observation and four AHB person-observations with atypical age-by-wave patterns to prevent any participant from having multiple observations in a single age bin (e.g., an AHB participant assessed at age 31 at Wave 6 and age 34 at Wave 7 would otherwise have two person-observations that could be used for the 31\u201334 age bin)."

This included time-varying marriage effects and time-invariant sex and familial AUD effects (see Figure 1).\nFor the marriage effects, at each age bin, the marriage variables were modeled as two dummy variables, one contrasting \u201cnever married\u201d versus \u201cbecame married\u201d and one contrasting \u201cnever married\u201d versus \u201cpost-marriage.\u201d As noted in the Measures section, the contrast of primary interest was the first contrast of the \u201cbecamemarried\u201d versus \u201cnever married\u201d groups. The second contrast involving the \u201cpost-marriage\u201d group was primarily employed to facilitate homogeneity of the groups in the first contrast. An alternative approach of merely excluding those who could not be classified as either \u201cnever married\u201d or \u201cbecame married\u201d could not be used in these analyses, given thatmembers of the \u201cpost-marriage\u201d group at one time point were often involved in the key contrast of \u201cnever married\u201d versus \u201cbecame married\u201d at an earlier time point. Note that, as with other group comparisons using sets of dummy variables, the composition of the third \u201cpost-marriage\u201d group (e.g., percent still married versus divorced) will not affect the contrast of the first and second groups. Note also that, by design, given our inclusion of only participants who were unmarried at the first time point (due to our primary interest in observing longitudinal transitions into marriage), \u201cbecame married\u201d effects could not be modeled at the first age bin, and \u201cpost-marriage\u201d effects could not be modeled at the first three age bins. Although complex, this approach facilitates the key objective of allowing \u201cbecame married\u201d effects to be interpreted as prospective effects of becoming married as opposed to remaining never married, with this contrast predicting deviations in participants\u2019 ongoing problem-drinking growth trajectories.\nHypothesis tests of age differences in marriage effects\nTwo different types of Wald \u03c72 tests were conducted to test age differences in the \u201cbecame-married effect.\u201d An \u201comnibus\u201d Wald \u03c72 test assessed whether model fit reduced significantly when constraining the became-married effect to equality across all age bins at which it was estimated. A \u201clinear\u201dWald \u03c72 test provided a more specific and thus presumably more statistically powerful test of our age moderation hypothesis (Agresti, 2018). This test involved constraining the changes in the marriage effects from one wave to the next to be equivalent and then assessing if the resulting rate of linear change in the marriage effect differed significantly from zero."

Thus, these two models were retained and expanded upon in the second model-building stage.\nNote that we also considered an alternative strategy of choosing a single modeling approach for both samples. Specifically, the model comparisons in Table 2 can be interpreted to indicate that a free-curve negative binomial model would be the most parsimonious model that could account for characteristics of both samples, accounting for the negative binomial dispersion in AFDP and the need for a freely estimated growth curve in AHB. In supplemental models that retained the free-curve negative binomial model for both AFDP and AHB in accordance with this alternative strategy (see Supplemental Appendix S3), resulting conclusions regarding our hypotheses were very similar to those from our primary 1Other approaches do exist that could similarly capitalize on within-wave age heterogeneity to provide a developmentally sensitive analysis of age-related change.We chose our approach due to the flexibility and straightforwardness it provides in modeling different forms of problem-drinking change and different forms of age differences in marriage effects. As an alternative to SEM, growth models can be estimated in a multilevel-modeling (MLM) framework. However, there are some general advantages of growth modeling in SEM versus MLM, including SEM\u2019s flexibility in accounting for intercept-slope covariance and heteroscedasticity in the outcome\u2019s relation to time (Grimm, Ram, & Estabrook, 2017). Further, while SEM allowed us to estimate \u201cfree-curve\u201d growth models, MLM would not have allowed as straightforward a way to model an unspecified form of problem-drinking change. Also, while SEM allowed an omnibus test of age-bin differences inmarriage effects, we believe it would have been more challenging in MLM to achieve a comparable test of an unspecified form of age moderation. MLM-based alternatives aside, an alternative SEM approach would have involved wave-based growth modeling in conjunction with estimation of random slopes to account for individually varying ages within waves (i.e., theMplus TSCORES function; Muth\u00e9n & Muth\u00e9n, 19982\u2013017). However, this approach is generally prone to model nonconvergence (Grimm et al., 2017), and it restricts how age can be modeled in a way that would have limited our flexibility in testing different forms of age moderation.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0954579422000827 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nanalyses where different best-fitting models were retained for AFDP versus AHB."

Because sex is an especially important factor to consider in research on effects of family role transitions, we attempted to at least glean some preliminary insights into potential sex moderation by re-estimating our primary models separately in males and females (see Supplemental Appendix S4). These analyses yielded mixed conclusions. In AFDP, there did appear to be sex differences such that effects of becoming married did decrease by age among males in a way similar to our primary results, whereas effects of becoming married were significant across all ages among females. Further, theWald tests of age reductions inmarriage effects were significant for AFDP males (omnibus: \u03c72(4)=37.00 (p < .001); linear: \u03c72(1)= 11.67 (p < .001)) but not significant in AFDP females (omnibus: \u03c72(3)= 1.04 (p = .792); linear: \u03c72(1)= 0.03 (p = .888). In AHB, however, both males and females showed effects of becoming married that decreased by age. The Wald tests of age reductions in marriage effects only reached or approached significance for AHB males (omnibus: \u03c72(3)= 7.55 (p = .056); linear: \u03c72(1)= 3.91 (p = .048)), but the nonsignificant of these Wald tests among AHB females (omnibus: \u03c72(3)= 3.01 (p = .390); linear: \u03c72(1)= 1.07 (p = .301)) should be interpreted with caution due to the relative statistical-power limitation of these models.\nSupplemental analyses were also conducted to investigate confounding effects of marital recency as a potential threat to internal validity and thus as a potential alternative explanation for our apparent evidence for age-related reductions in marriage effects. In Supplemental Appendix S4, descriptive analyses do show a pattern of greater recency of marriage among younger \u201cbecame married\u201d participants. This could tentatively support an argument that weaker marriage effects were observed at later ages because those later marriages were less recent in relation to the time point when problem-drinking change was subsequently assessed. However, in supplemental models that parsed \u201cbecame married\u201d groups into high-recency and low-recency subgroups at each age bin, there was little evidence for stronger effects of more recent marriages (see Supplemental Appendix S5). In fact, across the age bins, it often appeared that less recency was associated with a slightly stronger \u201cbecame married\u201d effect. This is opposite to the direction\nNote.

            "text": "As reviewed in the Introduction section, reasons to predict that family roles like marriage may exert particularly strong beneficial effects earlier in adulthood include (1) the importance of such adult role transitions during young adulthood per established developmental theory (e.g., Erikson, 1968) and (2) broader arguments that contextual effects may diminish with age across adulthood as individuals increasingly construct their own environments (Kendler et al., 2007; Scarr & McCartney, 1983). In light of these ideas, our current results may more broadly indicate a peak in earlyto-middle young adulthood in individuals\u2019 tendency and/or capacity for adapting to new contextual demands. However, this broader potential interpretation is indeed quite speculative.\nAs noted earlier, effects of family roles like marriage are often interpreted through the lens of sociologic role incompatibility theory (Yamaguchi & Kandel, 1985). Thus, our theoretical basis for making our hypotheses and interpreting our results largely reflects concepts from role incompatibility theory and our\nconceptual extensions of these concepts into a life span developmental framework. From this view, our results may reflect the fact that earlier marriages more often prompt behavior change such as drinking reductions because of a need to adapt to the marital role and thereby resolve conflict between behaviors and the role\u2019s demands (i.e., role socialization as ameans of resolving role incompatibility). In contrast, those at later ages of adulthood may more often preemptively avoid such conflict by avoiding marriage when it can be expected to conflict with established behaviors like their drinking (i.e., role selection as a means of avoiding role incompatibility). In addition to role selection via role avoidance, older individuals may also engage in more role selection via choosingmarital partners with characteristics that will decrease the likelihood/ extent of role incompatibility. Thus, problem drinkers who marry at later ages may more often marry heavy-drinking or drinkingpermissive spouses. Also, older individuals may engage in more selection via role departure, perhaps with marriage-related role incompatibility more often resulting in divorce rather than behavioral changes like adaptive drinking reductions. Future research should investigate each of these three specific forms of role selection to assess if each increasingly occurs with age and thereby contributes to the age reductions in marriage effects shown in our results.\nThere are other plausible potential mechanisms of marriage\u2019s beneficial effects aside from those related to role incompatibility, and these represent other conceptual interpretations that could further inform an understanding of our findings. These other potential mechanisms include marriage-driven personality maturation (e.g., increased conscientiousness; Lee et al., 2015; Littlefield et al., 2009) and marriage-driven relationship bonding (e.g., Roberts & Chapman, 2000; Sampson et al., 2006), both of which could reduce with age to produce the currently observed age reductions in marriage effects on drinking change. Further, other viable interpretations of our findings could emphasize potential life span developmental differences in the typical nature of marriage itself.

Yet other viable interpretations could emphasize life span developmental differences in the landscape of other drinking-related risk factors. For instance, due to a greater prevalence of various contextual (e.g., peerrelated) risk factors at younger ages (Schulenberg et al., 2018), earlier marriages may more often serve to buffer against these contextual risks that could otherwise prompt problemdrinking continuation or escalation. Thus, multiple nonmutually exclusive mechanisms might explain the currently observed age-related decline in the magnitude of the marriage effect on problem-drinking reductions."

            "text": "Regardless of these alternative interpretations, our findings highlight that the timing of family role transitions like marriage deserves empirical attention. Other research has characterized how certain risk factors can delay timing of marriage and parenthood (e.g., Waldron et al., 2011), and our findings exemplify how such delays could diminish the benefits these family role transitions convey. Our findings also complement work (e.g., Little et al., 2009) suggesting limited salutary effects of non-normatively early transitions to family roles (e.g., in late adolescence). Thus, there may be nonlinear moderation by age such that marriage\u2019s beneficial effects peak around early-to-middle young adulthood, and future research should investigate the extent that the same or different constructs explain marriage\u2019s weaker effects prior to and after these ages (i.e., \u201cmediated moderation\u201d testing more conceptual moderators that may mediate age\u2019s moderating effects; MacKinnon & Fairchild, 2009).\nRegarding public health implications, given recent demographic shifts toward later marriage and parenthood (Furstenberg, 2010), our findings suggest that such shifts could reduce the magnitude of family role-driven drinking reductions in the population. Indeed, according to US epidemiologic data (Schulenberg et al., 2019), more recent cohorts have shown a relatively blunted pattern of drinking reductions during the 20s (e.g., Jager et al., 2015; Patrick et al., 2019). Given our current evidence for age specificity of marriage effects, it is sensible to speculate that this trend toward less dramatic young adult \u201cmaturing out\u201d in recent years may have been influenced by the trends toward later marriage and parenthood. However, this raises questions about generalizability of our findings to more recent cohorts. Thus, a key next step in this line of research should involve cross-cohort longitudinal analyses assessing if there have been shifts across recent cohorts in the ages at which family role effects are strongest."

            "text": "Our findings reflect one specific instantiation of the ways that life span developmental research can help guide interventions by better accounting for variability in key risk and protective processes across different developmental periods of adulthood. Our findings suggest that young\u2013adult interventions should emphasize processes of adaptation to adult roles like marriage. Such interventions may be able to jumpstart and amplify role adaptation processes already primed to occur naturally in this developmental period, which may make this strategy particularly impactful and efficient. Importantly, this clinical strategy could also include efforts to spur anticipatory role adaptation, consistent with evidence that anticipatory drinking reductions prior to marriage can occur naturally (Bachman et al., 2002). The above arguments are not meant to imply that midlife problem drinkers could not also benefit from interventions emphasizing role adaptation. However, it may at least be useful for clinicians to anticipate that, when using this strategy at older ages, clinicians may (1) encounter more potential barriers and (2) more often be aiming to initiate role adaptation processes rather than amplifying naturally ongoing ones.\nThe broader objective of understanding life span variability in mechanisms of problem-drinking desistance\nThere is a dearth of research on developmental differences across adulthood in patterns and predictors of problem-drinking reduction, despite the fact that key unique insights have been gleaned from developmental analyses focused on heterogeneity across earlier developmental periods (e.g., from childhood to late adolescence; Chassin et al., 2013; NIAAA, 2017). The current study indicates that marriage may be a particularly important mechanism of problem-drinking reduction in young adulthood relative to later periods of the adult life span. However, given the ongoing increases in older adult problem drinking that coincide with aging of the \u201cbaby boomer\u201d generation (Han et al., 2009), future research should continue to examine other possible mechanisms that may be important in later periods of adulthood."

            "text": "Despite its strengths, there are noteworthy limitations of the current study. First, our samples were assessed from the late teens to late 30s, and future research spanning the entire adult life span is needed. Second, although a confound should be noted between age of marriage and marital recency (i.e., years since marriage at a given longitudinal observation), supplemental analyses with the AFDP sample ruled out marital recency as an alternative explanation for our evidence of stronger marriage effects at younger ages\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0954579422000827 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0954579422000827 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n(see Supplemental Appendix S4). Third, AFDP and AHB had notable sample differences, which created some differences in the analyses (e.g., AHB\u2019s more restricted lower bound of age required exclusion of the 17\u201320-year-old age bin from AHB analyses). Although such differences somewhat limit comparability across studies, they also highlight the generalizability reflected by our replication of findings in both studies. Despite replication, these samples include less recent cohorts of high-risk participants that are nonrepresentative of other populations, so the current analyses should be replicated in other samples. Note though that the AFDP and AHB studies took place over similar time periods (from around the mid-80s to the early 2000s), so there is unlikely to be cause for concern regarding cohort differences between the two studies that could jeopardize their comparability.\nFourth, this study also did not attend to other romantic-relationship transitions (e.g., cohabitation, divorce, remarriage), other life course events (e.g., parenthood, education/employment transitions), moderation by sex, sexual minority status, ethnicity, culture, nationality, familial AUD, or other comorbid mental health conditions. For the interested reader, Supplemental Appendices S6 and S7 (1) characterize ways that life course events other thanmarriage vary in prevalence across this study\u2019s age bins and (2) present supplemental models supporting the robustness of findings while accounting for potential confounding effects of parenthood and marital engagement. Unfortunately, the present study lacks available data to clarify whether courtship or cohabitation effects may vary by age and how this may confound our results. However, in contrast to marriage, past research has not tended to link courtship or cohabitation to drinking reductions (Caetano et al., 2006; Fryar et al., 2007; Joung et al., 1995; Power et al., 1999; Schoenborn, 2004), so we believe it is unlikely that our findings are spuriously driven by confounding age differences in cohabitation effects."
