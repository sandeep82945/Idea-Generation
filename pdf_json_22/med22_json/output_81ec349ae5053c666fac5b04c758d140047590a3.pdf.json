    "abstractText": "Background: This study aims to identify genotype variants of the platelet-derived growth factor alpha polypeptide gene (PDGFA) that can influence the individual response to the treatment with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in tennis elbow patients. Methods: We observed a cohort of 107 patients (132 elbows) with tennis elbow who received treatment with PRP. Patients have been followed-up for two years after PRP injection and the effectiveness of the treatment was measured using universal patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs): visual analog scale (VAS), quick version of disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand score (QDASH), and patient-rated tennis elbow evaluation (PRTEE). PROMs values, and clinical and platelet parameters were compared between genotype variants of the studied polymorphisms (rs1800814, rs2070958 and rs62433334). Results: The A allele carriers (rs1800814) had significantly lower values of VAS (week 12), QDASH, and PRTEE (weeks 8, 12). The T allele carriers (rs2070958) had significantly lower values of VAS (weeks 8, 12), QDASH, and PRTEE (weeks 4\u201312). Additional forms of therapy (manual and physical) were necessary significantly more often in GG (rs1800814) and CC (rs2070958) homozygotes. Conclusions: The PDGFA gene\u2019s polymorphisms influences the effectiveness of PRP therapy in tennis elbow treatment. The effectiveness of PRP is greater in A allele (rs1800814) and T allele (rs2070958) carriers.",

            "text": "Elbow tenderness and pain with resisted wrist extension are common manifestations of lateral epicondylitis, known as the tennis elbow (TE). The more recent name that reflects the etiology of this dysfunction is enthesopathy of the lateral epicondyle of the humerus [1]. Despite many years of research, the gold standard of treatment has not been established. More and more reports prove the usefulness of autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in\nJ. Clin. Med. 2022, 11, 3504. https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm11123504 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/jcm\nJ. Clin. Med. 2022, 11, 3504 2 of 14\nthe treatment of TE [2\u20135]. This therapy is used in many fields of medicine, including regenerative and sports medicine [6]. PRP is a source of over-physiological concentrations of growth factors and other signaling molecules that intensify the body\u2019s healing efforts [2,7]. Platelets play a key role in the regulation of processes related to tissue remodeling and their reorganization following injury or inflammatory processes. They belong to the mediators necessary in the initiation of the body\u2019s immune response, regulation of the angiogenesis process, apoptosis, and recruitment of progenitor cells to maintain the integrity of blood vessels [7]. Most of these processes are mediated by platelets and occur during their degranulation when platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs) are released. PDGFs are a group of multifunctional proteins that were discovered in the 1970s [8]. They are synthesized based on four polypeptide chains, encoded by the PDGFA, PDGFB, PDGFC, and PDGFD genes. The PDGFA gene is located within chromosome 7 (7p22) [9] and is highly expressed in most human tissues [10]. The data available so far indicate the significant role of PDGFA in reducing inflammation and accelerating the healing of musculoskeletal injuries [11], osteogenic differentiation, and bone tissue fusion [12]. It should be underlined that despite the potential benefits of PRP therapy, there are significant differences in the results of its use in patients with enthesopathy of the lateral epicondyle of the humerus. The different treatment outcomes may be related to the genetic variation expressed by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the gene encoding the PDGFA growth factor. Therefore, we conducted studies to establish whether selected polymorphisms of the PDGFA gene could modulate the response to platelet-rich plasma therapy."

Th noted effect is short-term and c nc rns observations in weeks 4\u201312 of follow-up, depending on the genetic variant, adopted in eritanc model, and analyzed PROM. In C allel carriers of the rs62433334 polymorphism, the therapy is ben ficial only in the long-term perspective (higher values of \u2206QDASH and \u2206QDASH at week 104 of follow-up than in GG homozygotes). One of th main problems in int rpreting t results of genetic st i s, especially those conducted in virgin areas for genetics, is the lack of reference studies. The only study that may indirectly explain the observations of th present study is the wo k of Zeckey et al., regarding the role of variants of cytokine genes in the regeneration processes [18]. Out of\nJ. Clin. Med. 2022, 11, 3504 10 of 14\ntwenty polymorphisms analyzed, there were two SNPs of the PDGFA gene (rs1800814 and rs62433334), which were also studied in our present research. It marked the GGC haplotype (within the polymorphisms rs1800814, rs62433334, and rs13309625 of the PDGFA gene), which determined the lack of proper aseptic union of the long bones of the lower limbs more than three times (OR = 3.57; 95% CI: 1.21\u201310.52; p = 0.020). According to the authors of the study, polymorphisms within the PDGFA gene seem to be a genetic risk factor for the development of non-unions of the lower extremity following a fracture [18]. These results are consistent with those obtained in the present work. Also in our research, the presence of the G allele (precisely GG homozygosity) in each of the polymorphisms was associated with a lower efficiency of the therapy. It should also be noted that in our study, additional physical therapy treatment during follow-up was more frequently necessary in GG homozygotes of both polymorphisms than in A allele carriers (rs1800814) and C allele carriers (rs62433334). A similar relationship was also observed in the case of the rs2070958 polymorphism, where the higher frequency of manual therapy during follow-up was for CC homozygotes relative to T allele carriers. We were somewhat surprised that both the A allele carriers (rs1800814) and the T allele carriers (rs2070958) had a lower concentration of PDGF-AB than the GG and CC homozygotes of the studied polymorphisms, i.e., patients with worse therapeutic effectiveness. It was even more surprising that the factors that were related to/correlated with the concentration of PDGF-AB in the current study (platelet concentration, age, cigarette smoking) did not differentiate the variants of the studied polymorphisms in the recessive/dominant model. Only in the additive model, among the AA homozygotes of the rs1800814 polymorphism, a higher proportion of cigarette smokers was observed than in the AG heterozygotes. However, subjects of both genotypes belong to the A allele carriers. Moreover, there are no differences between them in PROMs and platelet parameters, including PDGF-AB concentration. PDGF is a strong mitogenic factor involved in musculoskeletal tissue regeneration [19\u201324]. The results of in vitro studies suggest that the mitogenic response to PDGF-AB may be dependent on both the time of exposure and the dose of the cytokine. Manoranjan et al. analyzed the effect of PDGF-AB on human periodontal ligaments fibroblasts (hPDLF) at 50, 100, and 150 ng/mL dosages at 24, 48, and 72 h of time duration [25]. This study showed that PDGF-AB induced a maximal mitogenic response in hPDLF within 48 h and an intermediate dose of 100 ng/mL, while at the dose of 150 ng/mL a decrease in the mitotic potential of PDGF-AB was observed [25]. Significant methodological discrepancies, as well as the research model used, make it difficult to relate the results of this work to the results of the current study. It seems obvious, however, that the dynamics of PDGF-AB-dependent processes will be different in the in vitro and in vivo systems. The concentration of PDGF-AB in a PRP preparation will not be the only determinant of therapeutic success in the in vivo system. It will also depend on the sex and age of the patient [26,27], the general condition of the body and physical activity [28], but also the use of medications, e.g., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [29], the presence of comorbidities, and finally the cellular composition of PRP [30]. In our study, however, we did not find significant differences in clinical and biochemical parameters between patients with particular variants of the PDGFA gene, which would explain the observed differences in PDGF-AB concentration. Returning to the studies documenting the influence of cytokine concentration on the effectiveness of therapy, the analysis of the relationship between the PRP composition and the effectiveness of PRP treatment of tennis elbow was carried out by Lim et al. [31]. The results of this study indicated that parameters such as the concentration of platelets, PDGF-AB, PDGF-BB, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) were not correlated with the progress of PRP treatment, and those that correlated with them were the concentration of white blood cells and transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) [31]. In addition, Sundman et al. showed that the injection of PRP leads to an increase in the concentration of PDGF-AB, TGF-\u03b2, and IL-1\u03b2, moreover the level of increase depends on the cellular composition of\nJ. Clin. Med. 2022, 11, 3504 11 of 14\nPRP [30]. Moreover, de Melo Viveiros et al. observed that treatment with PRP causes a significant increase in the production of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interleukin 8 (IL-8) in lateral epicondylitis derived cells [32]. It is unknown how these cytokines affect the regeneration process during tennis elbow. Due to the limited knowledge on this subject, further research is necessary which would focus on determining the influence of growth factors on the effectiveness of PRP therapy in the treatment of tendinopathies. Such an analysis will not be complete if it does not take into account the basic demographic, biochemical, and clinical factors which, on the one hand, may affect the composition of PRP and, on the other hand, modify the body\u2019s response to the therapy. An analysis of the literature on the genetics of musculoskeletal system injuries also reveals large gaps in knowledge, especially in terms of prognostic factors, potentially modifying the body\u2019s response to platelet-rich plasma therapy. Such factors certainly include variants of the cytokine genes present in PRP. In our previous work, we showed that specific genotypes of the PDGFB gene, namely TT (rs2285099), CC (rs2285097), and AA (rs2247128) were associated with a significantly higher effectiveness of PRP therapy. during almost the entire one-year follow-up period [13]. These data, together with the results of the present study, suggest that the body\u2019s response to the PRP therapy may be the result of the interaction of multiple gene variants (multi-gene inheritance model). A review of the contemporary literature shows that the goal of most of the remaining studies was to look for genetic risk factors for tendinopathy. The vast majority of these works are case-control studies. Due to the applied research model, their results are characterized by high variability resulting from different criteria for selecting the study and control groups, as well as ethnic differences. In the light of current knowledge, well-established factors of susceptibility to tendinopathy are the polymorphic variants of collagen, type I, alpha-1 (COL1A1) [33], collagen, type V, alpha-1 (COL5A1) [34] and matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP3) [35] genes. However, little is known about their effect on the prognosis of tennis elbow therapy, as such studies have not been conducted so far. Our study was limited by the relatively small size of the study group and the lack of formal protocol for post-injection physiotherapy. The size of the group is a strong limiting factor in the analysis of qualitative variables, whereas the main data analyzed in the current study were quantitative variables (PROMs, platelet parameters) for which the number of patients was sufficient. Regarding the rehabilitation protocol, we considered it unethical to influence patients\u2019 therapeutic decisions. As a result, we obtained additional data and identified genotypes that required physiotherapeutic intervention during follow-up more frequently. Our results are not only a statement or not of a relationship between the PDGFA gene polymorphism and the effectiveness of tennis elbow treatment. In our opinion, the most important thing about them is that they combine clinical aspects and biological issues not in a purely academic but also in a practical form. Perhaps one day it will be enough to test the type of polymorphism before applying PRP therapy and implement it in patients susceptible to treatment. In summary, the results of our study show that the influence of polymorphism of genes encoding platelet growth factors may be related to specific results of tennis elbow treatment. In addition, according to the authors, the perspective of examining the effectiveness of PRP treatment in other musculoskeletal conditions in terms of gene polymorphism should be used more widely."

The carrier-state of the A (rs1800814) and T (rs2070958) alleles of the PDGFA gene predispose to a better response to PRP therapy. Therapy is the least effective in the GG homozygotes of both polymorphisms. After PRP injection, GG homozygotes more often require additional forms of therapy (physical therapy, manual therapy).\nJ.
