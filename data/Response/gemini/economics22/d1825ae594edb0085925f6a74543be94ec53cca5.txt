1. **Investigate the relationship between mixing and mobility in other models of wealth dynamics.** RGBM is a simple model of wealth dynamics, and it is not clear whether the relationship between mixing and mobility that we found in this model will hold in other models. For example, it would be interesting to study the relationship between mixing and mobility in models that include heterogeneous agents, or in models that allow for the possibility of negative wealth.


2. **Develop measures of mixing that are applicable to empirical data.** The relaxation time is a measure of mixing that can be estimated from empirical data, but it is not the only possible measure of mixing. It would be useful to develop other measures of mixing that are also applicable to empirical data, and to compare the different measures to see how they perform in different situations.


3. **Study the relationship between mixing and economic inequality.** We found that in RGBM, there is a negative relationship between the reallocation rate and the Pareto tail parameter, which is a measure of economic inequality. This suggests that there may be a relationship between mixing and economic inequality in general. It would be interesting to study this relationship in more detail, and to see whether it holds in other models of wealth dynamics and in empirical data.


4. **Investigate the implications of mixing for economic policy.** If mixing is an important determinant of economic mobility, then it is important to understand how economic policy can affect mixing. For example, it would be interesting to study the effects of different tax policies, social welfare programs, and educational policies on mixing.


5. **Explore the relationship between mixing and other social phenomena.** Mixing is a concept that is used in a variety of fields, including physics, sociology, and biology. It would be interesting to explore the relationship between mixing and other social phenomena, such as social mobility, crime, and health.
