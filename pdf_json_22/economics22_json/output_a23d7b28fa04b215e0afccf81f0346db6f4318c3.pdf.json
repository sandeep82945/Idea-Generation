    "abstractText": "The concept of health security has aroused several interpretations because of theoretical technique indifferences or academic methodology. The focus has been on human security, old age health security (OAHS), whereas there remain issues of low healthcare utilization by older people from rural Ghana while there are social assistance programs. The study aimed at investigating the mediating effect of healthcare utilization on Livelihood Empowerment against Poverty (LEAP) and old age health security OAHS. With purposive sampling technique, participants were selected to participate in the study with standardized quantitative questionnaire to measure the variables involved in the study and a regression technique to analyze the data. The result of the mediation analysis showed a partial mediation between LEAP and Healthcare Utilization (HU) was found to have bridged the gap between the LEAP and OAHS. The LEAP policy also caused an increase in Health Utilization and, subsequently, an increase in old age health security (OAHS). The study is essential to help the National Health Insurance Authority NHIA in restructuring health care premiums to incite utilization of health facilities by the aged.",

            "text": "The concept of health security has aroused several interpretations and conceptions because of indifferences in theoretical and academic approaches. The paradigm focus has been on human security until a shift in 2001. The paradigm shift in 2001 linked health security notion to a global approach for ameliorating the transmission of contagious illness throughout national borders [1]. This has called for a pragmatic approach to ensure that individuals, particularly the older population (above 60 years), are significantly cared for by instituting and implementing social policies that promote their health security. The world has recently experienced about 3.2% estimated growth of old people above 60 years and will subsequently follow that trend in years to come [2]. Inarguably, 2015 saw a total world population of 900 million old people aged 60 years and over and it is assumed to exceed 2 billion by the year 2050 [3]. In Africa, it is estimated that by the year 2050, the number of older persons would rise to 161 million [2]. However, the aging population of Ghana is increasing exponentially, surpassing all other Sub-Saharan African countries [4]. Undoubtedly, the increase in the aging population means a huge burden on health care systems and facilities due to old age-associated diseases [5]. As a result, seeking frequent health care services would be the only panacea for these health challenges, hence the need for health security in the form of social interventions for those who cannot afford it. Presently, social protection is principally about protecting the very poor and defenseless [6]. International organizations are driving social protection interventions with the\nHealthcare 2022, 10, 370. https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10020370 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/healthcare\nInternational Labor Organization [7] initiating a Social Protection Floor (SPF), requiring member countries to \u201censure an all-inclusive and universal program and policies for the extremely poor and vulnerable in societies\u201d. Old Age Health Security (OAHS) in Ghana aims to improve elderly health conditions, including Health Insurance Scheme and Livelihood Empowerment against Poverty (LEAP). The cardinal inspiration for adopting the LEAP was from the 2007 Ghana Statistical Service reportage on the number of abysmal homes in Ghana underutilizing healthcare (880,000, 18.2% of the population) [8]. In Ghana, LEAP is a pro-poor and social protection policy designed for the poor and venerable. This program has supported thousands of poor old adults in the communities. A study by Handa et al. [9] and Peprah et al. [6] reveals that the LEAP program offers monetary assistance to impoverished households, provides free enrollment into the NHIS for beneficiaries [9] which improves formal healthcare utilization [10]. The program since its inception in 2008 has focused greatly on giving cash transfers and training to these poor aged. The LEAP program provides cash transfers to poor households, orphans, persons with disabilities, and the older adults above 65 years Since its inception, the programs\u2019 impact on local economic development, health and basic food needs has been tremendous [6]. It has encouraged the majority of the poor older adults to seek healthcare, and obtain health security. Debrah [8] asserts that LEAP beneficiaries who registered for National Health Insurance Scheme, especially pregnant women and the aged gained access to antenatal care and free health care. His findings show that, generally, LEAP fuels access to health care utilization. The program has been described as a unique one that has supported livelihood, healthcare utilization and health security of the extremely poor and marginalized groups in Ghana. Currently, the LEAP program has reached over 35,000 households with an annual expenditure of approximately $11,000,000; bi-monthly expenses stretching from GH/C 48.00 to GH/C 90.00. LEAP has had a great impact on the lives of the beneficiaries and community developments [9]. Notwithstanding the global increase in literature on the health security of the areas above, there have been enormous bottlenecks to the operation of social intervention programs and the impact of social interventions on OAHS. In the same vein, there has recently been low utilization of healthcare services by older people in rural Ghana. It is against this backdrop that the present study examines the mechanisms through which the key social interventions such as the Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty rolled out in Ghana contributes to Health Security of Older Adults through the mediation role of healthcare utilization."

            "text": "Alleviating poverty and promoting healthcare utilization has been a major issue of discussion by several international organizations. As a result, LEAP was instituted in Ghana. The cardinal inspiration for adopting the LEAP was from the 2007 Ghana Statistical Service reportage on the number of abysmal homes in Ghana underutilizing healthcare (880,000, 18.2% of the population) [8]. Previous studies have attempted to unravel the factors that stimulate access to healthcare utilization. Andersen et al. [11] stipulates several factors that incite citizenry to utilize healthcare services. Other studies by Agyemang-Duah et al. [12] and Hwang et al. [13] concentrated primarily on LEAP and Old Age Health Security. To them, the LEAP program tends to boost older people\u2019s health security in Ghana, but, Agyemang-Duah et al. [12] listed some hurdles to the LEAP in the quest to ensure older people\u2019s health security. Contrary to Handa et al. [9], Agyemang-Duah et al. [14] reveal how the poor and elderly benefiting from LEAP are mandated to bear part of some medical expenses. Obviously, poor older people without financial strength will be unable to adequately use the healthcare services. To this end, they argue that removing financial barriers that inhibit access to professional\nhealthcare under the LEAP is a turning point in the health of the older population because this positively influences formal healthcare utilization. There is an increasing recognition worldwide of the necessity to appraise healthcare services\u2019 usage and improve healthcare systems concerning the health needs of the aging populace [15]. Andersen Newman\u2019s healthcare utilization model explored varied causalities that compel the use of health services by the aged. Basically, healthcare utilization means \u2018obtaining healthcare from health service providers\u2019 [16] Factors that incite a person\u2019s tendency to use healthcare services include demographic and social characteristics such as gender, age, marital status, education level, living conditions, and children. The last factor from the Andersen healthcare utilization model is the need factor which reflects the illness level. Thus, one is compelled to utilize healthcare services due to health status, physical damage, changes in health status or having chronic diseases. Zavras et al. [17] indicate that healthcare utilization depends on self-realized health status, age, income, gender, and religion. Precisely, we could argue that an increase in healthcare utilization means the availability of resources and patients\u2019 level of satisfaction. This conforms to Liang et al.\u2019s [18] findings that healthcare utilization improves older people\u2019s psychological and general health.\nThe following hypotheses were developed:\nHypotheses 1 (H1). There is a positive relationship between LEAP and Healthcare Utilization.\nHypotheses 2 (H2). There is a positive relationship between LEAP and OAHS.\nThe aged require extensive healthcare as illness and disability increase due to aging [19]. The health security of older people in rural Ghana is a concern that prompted the establishment of the LEAP and the NHIS in 2004 by the Government of Ghana. The purpose was to guarantee equitable and widespread access for all Ghanaians to standard quality healthcare [20]. A study by the International Labor Organization [7] indicates that old people in low-and-middle-income countries are disadvantaged of a steady income because of lack of social pensions. This finding justifies the Government\u2019s decision to exempt old people utilizing health care through the NHIS from paying annual premiums. Notwithstanding the country\u2019s profound demographic transition in adults\u2019 quantity, it is critical to note that social interventions such as the NHIS and LEAP are vital to protect older people since their percentage is estimated to shift from 5% in 2015 to 10% in 2050 [2]. Blanchet et al. [21] noted that it is highly inequitable for an individual to make payments for healthcare since it acts as an obstacle to an individual acquiring timely and necessary treatment. More importantly, social interventions such as the LEAP and NHIS help increase healthcare utilization by old people. An increase in healthcare utilization means that the LEAP policy is yielding the desired results.\nBased on the above, the study hypothesizes that:\nHypotheses 3 (H3). There is a positive relationship between Healthcare Utilization and OAHS.\nHypotheses 4 (H4). Healthcare Utilization mediates the relationship between LEAP and OAHS.\nThe World Health Organization [22] links health security to communicable disease control. However, WHO\u2019s definition of health security raised some questions from authors such as The Lancet [23], who believed the organization had not entirely covered the bigger question in its definition, scope and implementation. Earlier, Ray-Bennett et al. [24] viewed health security as community participation, self-reliance and safeguarding of weak sects such as the aged, pregnant women and the poor, but Aldis et al. [1] argue that it\u2019s detached from the regular public health tactics.\nConceptual Framework\nThe conceptual framework in Figure 1 below was developed based on the literature review.\nHealthcare 2022, 10, 370 4 of 15\nHealthcare 2022, 10, x 4 of 15\nweak sects such as the aged, pregnant women and the poor, but Aldis et al.

Studying only older adults benefitting from the Livelihood Empowerment against Poverty Program, the study considered only those above 60 years who have lived in the study area for the past 10 years. However, since there was quite a number of older adults within the enclaves of the study area, the study first employed the purposive sampling technique using both inclusion and exclusion criterion to set the intended study respondents apart from others. Even though there is a tendency to commit a sampling bias using purposive sampling technique, the possible bias was minimized due to the inclusion and exclusion criteria used during the sampling. From the sampled set, questionnaires were then randomly distributed community to community by the two research assistants following no particular order in order to\nrepresent the whole population. The 2 research assistants were not obliged to go back to households because a legible respondent was absent at the time of data collection. Once the target number was achieved, questionnaire distributions ceased. The questionnaire had three sections: A, B, and C. Section \u201cA\u201d dealt with personal data of the respondents; section \u201cB\u201d consisted questions from related literature.; section \u201cC\u201d contained questions measuring the various variables (LEAP, Health Utilization and Old Age Health security). Section C was structured on a 5 point Likert scale, ranging from \u201cStrongly Disagree\u201d (SD), \u201cDisagree\u201d (D), \u201cNeutral\u201d (N), and \u201cAgree\u201d (A) to \u201cStrongly Agree\u201d. Respondents were instructed to respond according to their degree of agreement with the statements contained in the instrument(see Appendix A, Table A1) Questionnaires were developed in simple plain English taking the ages of the respondents into consideration. They were administered face to face. Those who could not read or write were assisted by 2 research assistants who helped with translations. Those who could read but couldn\u2019t write were still offered assistance to fill in the questionnaires. A total of 1 month was used to distribute and collect data. Out of the 318 sampled respondents administered with questionnaires, only 307 answered questionnaires were returned; this represents 96.5% of the recovery rate of the sampling tool. Out of the 307 received, seven were incomplete so were regarded null. The response rate was good as the study covered majority of questionnaires distributed, representing a 94% response rate. Researchers have asserted that a high response rate, precisely above 60\u201370% is vital in ensuring accuracy in results [25,26]."

The study employed multiple statistical analyses approach which included descriptive statistical procedures, bivariate correlation, multivariate regression and mediation analysis using the Sobel test. Hypotheses were tested using the multivariate regression with OLS and the Sobel test of mediation effect. The study utilized the OLS approach to estimate the regression Equations (1) and (2). These regression models estimated both the direct and mediation effects of the Healthcare Utilization (HU) in the relationship between LEAP and Old Age health Security (OAHS) using the Sobel test. The regression models estimating the mediation effects were given as:\nM = \u03b2X + \u03b51 (1)\nY = \u03b2X + \u03b2M + \u03b53 (2)\nwhere Y denotes the main dependent variable, M represents the mediating variables and X also represents the independent variable. From equations, \u03b2 is the coefficient of the\nexplanatory variables while \u03b5 also denotes the error term. The Equation (1) estimates the direct impact of the independent variable (X) on the Mediating variable (M) while Equation (2) also estimates the direct impact of the explanatory variable (X) and mediator (M) on the dependent Variables (Y). Finally, the mediation effect was predicted using the Sobel Test. For mediation effect to exist, X must have significant direct impact of Y and M. Similarly, M must also have significant impact on Y to permit for the mediation analysis to be conducted. The reliability of the data was checked using the Cronbach\u2019s Alpha test where a cronbach alpha value of 0.7 and above implies strongly reliable variable construct. Likewise, the Bivriate Pearson correlation analysis was used to determine the strength and direction of relationships between the key interest variables; Livelihood Empowerment against Poverty (LEAP), Healthcare utilization (HU) and Old Age Health Utilization (OAHS). Finally, multi-collinearity test was performed using the Variance Inflation Factors (VIF) and tolerance where variables with VIF values less than 10 indicate the non-existence of multi-collinearity."

Results from Table 3 reveal a strong positive and statistically significant relationship between LEAP and OAHS (r = 0.956, p = 0.000).

The results from regression Model 1 focused on testing Hypothesis 1 (H1) which sought to examine the impact of LEAP on Healthcare Utilization among the older adults. The results from Table 4 indicate an R-square value of 0.783 (R2 = 0.783) which implies that, about 78.3% of the variations in the dependent variables (Healthcare Utilization) is explained by the independent variables such as LEAP, and the control variables such as marital status and occupation of the respondents. Similarly, results from\nTable 4 shows that, the F-statistics (F = 104.153, p < 0.001) was statistically significant at 1% level. This implies that, the independent variables have joint statistically significant impact on the dependent variable (Healthcare Utilization).\nNote: *** p < 0.001, ** p < 0.05 and * p < 0.10.\nFindings from regression model 1 in Table 4 reveal that, LEAP has a statistically significant and positive impact on Healthcare Utilization (\u03b2 = 0.759, p < 0.001), meaning an improvement in the Livelihood empowerment program increases the healthcare utilization among older adults. These results support Hypothesis 1 (H1) which states that, there is a positive relationship between LEAP and Healthcare Utilization. The results from Table 4 also indicate that some demographic factors such as marital status and occupation have statistically significant positive impact on healthcare utilization among respondents. The results show that Divorced respondents (\u03b2 = 0.141, p < 0.10) are more likely to utilize healthcare services compared to the Unmarried. In terms of occupation of respondents, the results show that being a private worker (\u03b2 = 0.215, p < 0.05) has a significant positive impact on healthcare utilization compared to the unemployed (see Table 4). Regression Model 2 in Table 5 sought to test the research Hypotheses 2 and 3. The analysis emphasizes on examining the impact of LEAP and Healthcare Utilization on Older Adults Health Security (OAHS). Results obtained present an R-square value of 0.957 (R2 = 0.957) which implies that, about 95.7% of the variations in the dependent variables (OAHS) are explained by the independent variables such as LEAP, Healthcare Utilization and some demographic factors such as Age, sex, marital status and occupation. The results from Table 5 also shows that, the F-statistics (F = 580, p < 0.001) was statistically significant at 1% level. This means that the independent variables jointly influence the dependent variable (OAHS) which was statistically significant at 1% level. The regression model 2 in Table 5 indicates that, LEAP (\u03b2 = 0.650, p < 0.001) has a statistically significant and positive direct impact on OAHS. This supports the research Hypothesis 2 (H2) which states that there is a positive relationship between LEAP and OAHS. This result implies that, an improvement in the Livelihood empowerment program tend to promote the older adults\u2019 health security.\nNote: *** p < 0.001, ** p < 0.05.\nMoreover, the results from Table 5 depicts that, Healthcare Utilization (\u03b2 = 0.481, p < 0.001) has statistically significant positive impact on the older adults\u2019 health security. This finding also supports research Hypothesis 3 (H3) which states that there is a positive relationship between Healthcare Utilization and OAHS. Results from Table 5 further show that, some demographic factors such as age of respondents has positive impact on their health security. It shows that older adults aged 70\u201375 years (\u03b2 = 0.078, p < 0.05) are more likely to positively influence their health security compared to those who are 61\u201365 years. The results also show that respondents who were Divorced (\u03b2 = 0.138, p < 0.01) and those who were married (\u03b2 = 0.123, p < 0.01) are more likely to have health security at their old age compared to the respondents who were Unmarried. In terms of occupation of respondents, being a private worker (\u03b2 = \u22120.108 **, p < 0.05) has a significant negative impact on healthcare security compared to the unemployed (see Table 4). However, being a pensioner (\u03b2 = 0.086, p < 0.05) has a positive impact on the health security compared to the unemployed (see Table 5).

Results from the sobel test from Table 7 confirmed the effect of HU as a partial mediator between the independent and dependent variables; thus, this objective was achieved. Although there is a countless number of literature on old age health security, there remains a gap in the link between social intervention programs and old age health security. This necessitated the need to look into this area of the study. Practically, cash transfers have been the main modus operandi for most developing countries that implement social protection policies. It is the same with the implementation of Ghana\u2019s LEAP policy. Studies have shown that healthcare utilization among old age increases as their ages also keep increasing. It is hence, expected that with the LEAP supporting old age health expenses, there should be a majority of old age healthcare utilization. The results from the study show a positive strength between LEAP and healthcare utilization. This finding confirms the discoveries of Appiah et al. [28] and Appiah et al. [29]. The scholars embarked on the predictors of healthcare utilization among poor older people under the LEAP program in the Atwima Nwabiagya District of Ghana. However, their work further reveals that barriers associated with low utilization of healthcare services bore down to financial and proximity contemplations. The prevailing barriers were also highlighted in the works of Bhan et al. [30], mentioning financial constraints, inadequate health professionals and facilities. However, low utilization of healthcare utilization is a menace to old age health security. The importance of healthcare utilization is highlighted in the work of Atchessi et al. [31], which revealed that about 53% of older people who utilize health facilities are boosted by the presence of health insurance. In affirmation, Awoke et al. [32], in their cross-sectional survey in Ghana, found an increase of 17.8% and 51.7% of old people utilizing private and public healthcare facilities, respectively, due to LEAP program. From the above, AgyemangDuah et al. [14] assertion that LEAP offers support for the aged to utilize healthcare services cannot be underestimated. Moreover, the prevalence of healthcare utilization is high in Ghana and rural subSahara African settings [33]. This increase in developed countries is undoubted as numerous health insurances are prevalent in those regions. The study also discovered a substantial association between LEAP and old age health security. It revealed the participants\u2019 belief in LEAP being the bedrock for old age health security. This observation convinced the researcher to accept the earlier assumption. Specifically, the elderly who suffer from chronic diseases are likely to utilize healthcare services more often. Their postulation is in line with Hajek et al. [33], which revealed a substantial link between chronic disease and healthcare utilization. In developing countries such as Ghana, the LEAP has become a cornerstone for poverty reduction and old age health security. The researches of Peprah et al. [6] and Handa et al. [9] reveal that the LEAP program provides financial support to extremely poor family units including older people\nseeking healthcare. Dai [34] posited that in rural China, social health insurance scheme is one vital constituent of rural folks who are old and need health security. To explicate, Baozhen mentioned the importance of the role insurance plays in ensuring that the elderly in rural areas can afford and access to basic healthcare services. It is significant to note that the old age health security in Ghana is one of the targets to promote good health among the age. The NHIS and the LEAP program have not failed to achieve this. To promote the health of the old people, there should be a well-structured healthcare system that will aid in utilizing healthcare services. In other words, an efficient and reliable system is vital to the promotion of the health of old people. It is, however, not surprising as the observations of this research reveal an affirmative relation between healthcare utilization and old age health security. Several studies have raised the need to educate old people on the need to utilize healthcare services to promote their health. This agrees with other empirical studies on the significant association between education and OAHS [5,35]. However, Mcnamara et al. [36], disagreed with the assertion that the more the older people are educated on their health status, the more they use healthcare facilities. They opined that elderly people\u2019s level of use of healthcare facilities is not merely dependent on education. Furthermore, results from the study prove that health utilization partially mediates the relationship between the LEAP and old age health security. The finding is relatively similar to that of Gyasi [37]. Their study asserts that higher utilization is a springboard to the health security of old people and this aid in enrolling a higher number of old people onto the LEAP program. In other words, higher utilization means higher enrollment in LEAP as well as a promotion of health security. The study, however, recognizes the impact the LEAP directly has on old age health security. Consequently, the mediating effect of healthcare utilization is seen to have a significant association with LEAP and old age health security. This implies that in order to promote old age health, the LEAP programs need to be vibrant and promote healthcare utilization. A reduction in the smooth operation of the LEAP may directly or indirectly hinder the health status of old people. In spite of the relevant contributions of this study, some limitations are associated with this study. Noting these limitations may help guide future studies to extend the knowledge in the study area and achieve more improvement in their results. Firstly, the unique characteristics of urban communities in a developing country used as the study area limit the broader generalization of the findings. The extent of availability of quality healthcare facilities, health security and the livelihoods in the urban communities are different from that of communities in the rural areas and other jurisdictions. It is therefore important for future studies to consider other peri-urban communities in the rural settings. Again, results implied a causal relationship between LEAP, OAHS and HU. However, the use of the cross-sectional data and the type of research design employed limits the ability of the study to draw a solid conclusion on the causal relationship between the variables. It is possible there may be backward causation between HU and AOHS. Nonetheless, our data and research design does not permit such test. Hence future use of longitudinal data would be more appropriate to test and establish whether there is a reverse strong causality between these variables. Further, our sample size was particularly limited coupled with self-reported data. Future study may expand the sample size and incorporate a more rigorous statistical computation approach to address the robustness of the mediation analysis. It could also consider adding more moderating variables such as socio-demographic features of the participants and could also focus of comparative study between the urban and the rural communities in other countries to expand the scope of the study."

            "text": "The study explores a model that unravels the mediation of healthcare utilization on the relationship between LEAP and old age health security. It was found out that the\nLEAP program has made considerable strides in healthcare promotion among the more aging population. The results additionally indicated a positive relationship between Livelihood Empowerment against Poverty (LEAP), Healthcare Utilization (HU), and Old Age Health security (OAHS). Healthcare Utilization (HU) was found to have bridged the gap between the LEAP and OAHS. The LEAP policy caused an increase in Health Utilization and, subsequently, an increase in old age health security (OAHS). The result from the mediating analysis showed the complete pathway from LEAP to HU to OAHS was significant (z = 12.94, p = 0.000), indicating that HU partially mediates the effects of the independent variable and the dependent variable. Our results demonstrate that, the livelihood and empowerment against poverty program which provides monthly cash transfers to the older adults plays a significant role in supporting the older adults to access the healthcare facilities in the communities. This program has both direct and indirect significant positive influence on the older adults\u2019 health Security. The older adults are the groups that have been identified to have high rate of healthcare utilization due to their health status needs, susceptibility to frequent illness, weak immune systems, and high risk to falling sick. Through the LEAP program, the results show that, their health security has also been improved. The findings from this study therefore offers a strong implication for extended empirical and theoretical understanding of social support systems, healthcare utilization, wellness, health among the older adults from a developing country\u2019s perspective. The findings further provide support and guide to inform relevant policy on health and ageing, healthcare utilization and health security of the population. These findings from the study also inform a new direction of research in the areas of ageing and healthcare utilization and individual health outcome studies in the developing countries. The study recommends that there is a need for more efforts to maintain the LEAP program. Future studies may focus on the impact of Ghana\u2019s National Health Insurance Scheme on old age health security. It is finally recommended that local governments mobilize resources from their localities and distribute the LEAP funds to the beneficiaries instead of depending on central governments to avoid a delay in disbursement.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, E.N.A.A., B.D. and J.A.N.; methodology, E.N.A.A. and B.D.; analysis, E.N.A.A., E.L. and J.A.N.; supervision, B.D.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, E.N.A.A.; review editing, E.N.A.A., J.A.N., B.D. and E.L.
