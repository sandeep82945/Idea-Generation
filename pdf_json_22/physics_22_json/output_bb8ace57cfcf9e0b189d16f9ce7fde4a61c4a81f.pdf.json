The computational cost for a correlated many-electron calculation is reduced to that of the self-consistent-field Hartree-Fock method, while the accuracy still reaches that of sophisticated configuration interaction based methods. In this method, the two-electron cumulant energy is measured with an information entropy associated with the Fermi-Dirac distribution of the occupation numbers. An eigenvalue equation for the orbitals is obtained, with the eigenvalues (orbital energies) connected to the occupation numbers through the Fermi-Dirac distribution. The occupation numbers for the strongly occupied orbitals are very close to the natural orbital occupation numbers from wave function methods. It covers in a single scheme the nondynamical correlation in weak or breaking bonds as well as the dynamical correlation at all distances. The method is well suited to large-scale potential energy surface calculation and molecular dynamics simulation.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.128.013001\nArguably the most important problem in electronic structure theory is the accurate yet efficient rendering of the electron correlation energy. Specializing to atoms and molecules, a range of methods and implementations has been explored. Ab initio methods, i.e., Hartree-Fock (HF) plus some form of configuration interaction (CI), have been developed over a long time and can now be pushed to high accuracy, although at the expense of large amounts of computer time. They do not scale well for large systems. Density functional theory (DFT) [1,2] has enjoyed great popularity because of a good compromise between accuracy and efficiency [3]. It can be applied, in its Kohn-Sham (KS) form, to large systems, but the accuracy is still insufficient for many purposes. In particular for geometries that deviate from the equilibrium geometry (bond dissociation, transition states, general potential energy surfaces) it often falls short of the required accuracy. It is known that the exact exchange-correlation functional is nonlocal, and this nonlocality is particularly important when the (partial) spreading of exchange and correlation holes over the atoms of the dissociating bond plays a role. It is difficult to incorporate the nonlocality correctly in actual functionals. It appears that one has to invoke the virtual KS orbitals in order to achieve this [4\u20137]. Density matrix functional theory (DMFT) [8] has been investigated in the last decades for its potential to describe potential energy surfaces much better, also those of excited states. The primary reason is the natural incorporation of nonlocality effects by the involvement of \u201cvirtual\u201d natural orbitals (NOs) through the NO occupation numbers (ONs) [9]. In spite of some successes for small systems [10,11], DMFT has not become a main\nstream methodology due to theoretical and computational obstacles (see below). We present in this Letter a new method for correlated calculations. It is a variant of DMFT in that it involves the \u201cvirtual orbitals\u201d in a natural manner by their ONs (which are similar to the NO ONs). But it solves the practical computational problems of DMFT in that it requires just a self-consistent field procedure to obtain the orbitals, and therefore is as cost-effective as HF or KS calculations. It still delivers correlated energies by a new Ansatz for the electron cumulant energy (the correlation energy in the DMFT context) which is cast in the form of a function of the ONs which is inspired by information theoretic (Shannon entropy) concepts [12,13]. It will be shown to offer accurate correlated energies at essentially HF (or KS) computational expense. In DMFT the variable is the one-particle reduced density matrix (1RDM) \u03b3\u00f01; 10\u00de which has the spectral expansion\n\u03b3\u00f01; 10\u00de \u00bc X i ni\u03c7i\u00f01\u00de\u03c7 i \u00f010\u00de \u00f01\u00de\nThe eigenvectors f\u03c7ig are called the natural orbitals, and the eigenvalues fnig are their occupation numbers (ONs), which sum to the number of electrons P ni \u00bc N. For a single-determinant wave function (HF or KS), ni are either 0 or 1. For a correlated system with the wave function expanded as a linear combination of Slater determinants, the occupation numbers are fractional numbers, 0 < ni < 1. The diagonal element of the 1RDM, i.e., \u03b3\u00f01; 1\u00de, is the electron density. The kinetic energy and electronnucleus Coulomb energy can be expressed exactly with the\nPHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS 128, 013001 (2022) Editors' Suggestion\n0031-9007=22=128(1)=013001(6) 013001-1 \u00a9 2022 American Physical Society\nexact 1RDM. While progress has been made over the last two decades with optimization schemes for the NOs and ONs, and with the development of suitable 1RDM functionals [14\u201319], there are still theoretical and computational obstacles to overcome for DMFT to become a successful computational method. In his seminal paper on DMFT, Gilbert constructed an eigenvalue problem for the natural spin orbitals\nhG\u03c7i \u00bc \u03f5i\u03c7i: \u00f02\u00de\nThe one-electron Gilbert Hamiltonian hG is related to the functional E\u00f0\u03b3\u00de as hG \u00bc \u03b4E\u00f0\u03b3\u00de=\u03b4\u03b3\u00f01; 10\u00de. To his surprise, Gilbert [8] noted \u201can unexpected and paradoxical result for the one-particle reduced ensemble density kernel,\u201d \u201cthat all partially occupied natural spin orbitals must belong to the same degenerate eigenvalue (\u03f5i \u00bc \u03bc).\u201d Gilbert concluded: \u201cIf the operator hG can be constructed, it must be quite different from the one-electron orbital operators that occur in self-consistent-field theories\u201d (original quotation). This degeneracy problem is not prohibitive but still inconvenient. In the case that (an approximation to) the electronelectron energy is given in terms of the natural orbitals and occupation numbers, Pernal [20] has applied the chain rule to show that an effective one-electron operator hG can be explicitly derived. The degeneracy of the orbital energies in DMFT remains, for which a level-shift method was proposed, but successful implementation is still somewhat empirical. Conceptually the lack of meaningful orbital energies (cf. for estimates of excitation energies or band structures) is inconvenient. Computational inconveniences in current DMFT implementations compared with DFT are the occurrence of expensive four-index transformations to evaluate the exchange-correlation functional expressed in the NOs and ONs, and the required separate optimization of the ONs. Here we take a different route, which is based on a correlation energy functional associated with the twoelectron cumulant. The two-electron cumulant follows from the well-known decomposition of the two-particle reduced density matrix (here its diagonal element, the pair density) in terms of 1RDM contributions, plus a remainder,\n\u0393\u00f01; 2\u00de \u00bc 1 2 \u00bd\u03b3\u00f01; 1\u00de\u03b3\u00f02; 2\u00de \u2212 \u03b3\u00f01; 2\u00de\u03b3\u00f02; 1\u00de \u00fe \u03bb\u00f01; 2\u00de: \u00f03\u00de\nThe first term is the independent-particle contribution to the pair density, and the second term accounts for the exchange effect. The \u03bb\u00f01; 2\u00de term is called the two-electron cumulant [21,22]. The Hartree-Fock (HF) approximation is characterized by \u03bb\u00f01; 2\u00de \u00bc 0. It has been proven that if \u03bb\u00f01; 2\u00de is neglected and the total energy is optimized with only direct and exchange terms, an idempotent 1RDM will result [23]. We will call the energy associated with the two-electron cumulant\nEcum \u00bc Z\n\u03bb\u00f01; 2\u00de r12 d1d2 \u00f04\u00de\nthe cumulant correlation energy. It is to be distinguished from the traditional quantum chemical definition of correlation energy as the difference between the exact total energy and the HF energy, Ecor \u00bc Eexact \u2212 EHF. Entropy is a key concept of statistical mechanics. In quantum statistical mechanics, von Neumann [24] formulated the entropy using the density matrix (\u03c1) as S \u00bc \u2212Tr\u03c1 ln \u03c1. This leads for states \u03a8j occurring with probabilities pj in an ensemble to the expression S \u00bc \u2212 P\nj pj lnpj. In his information theory, Shannon [25] arrived at a similar expression for the uncertainty connected with a probability distribution fpig for events. It is therefore also denoted as Shannon entropy or information entropy. Jaynes [26] has investigated the basic assumptions of statistical mechanics (entropy maximization) from the viewpoint of information entropy being the more fundamental concept. Collins [27] once conjectured that an \u201centropy\u201d evalu-\nated with the 1RDM eigenvalues S \u00bc \u2212Pi ni ln ni would be proportional to the traditional correlation energy Ecor. However, this has not been substantiated, with for instance, large deviations for the simple H2 molecule along the internuclear coordinate [28\u201330]. However, in our recent work [12] we have established that this is different for the cumulant energy as a measure of correlation energy: when varying the geometry of a molecule the cumulant energy proves to have an almost perfect linear relationship with the entropy S \u00bc \u2212Pi ni ln ni:\nEcum \u00bc \u2212\u03baS \u2212 b \u00f05\u00de\nwhere \u03ba and b are constants depending on the system. Note that the correlation energy Ecum is a negative quantity [31]. In statistical physics, the entropy for fermions has been derived as [32,33] (apart from the kB factor)\nS \u00bc \u2212 X i \u00bdni ln ni \u00fe \u00f01 \u2212 ni\u00de ln \u00f01 \u2212 ni\u00de \u00f06\u00de\nwhere the ni are the (average) occupations of the oneelectron states. This form of the entropy has been discussed for the uniform electron gas [34]. It has recently been established that the linear relationship with the cumulant energy mentioned above also exists with the entropy of Eq. (6) (to distinguish it from the entropy S \u00bc \u2212Pi nilnni) [13]. In the Hartree-Fock approximation, ni are either 0 or 1, so the entropy is zero. For a correlated system, 0 < ni < 1, the entropy is positive. These investigations suggest a DMFT functional for the total energy using Eq. (5) and Eq. (6),\n013001-2\nE\u00bdfnig; f\u03c7ig \u00bc X i nihii \u00fe Y \u2212 \u03baS \u2212 b \u00f07\u00de\nwhere Y is\nY \u00bc 1 2\nZZ \u03b3\u00f01; 1\u00de\u03b3\u00f02; 2\u00de \u2212 \u03b3\u00f01; 2\u00de\u03b3\u00f02; 1\u00de\nr12 d1d2\n\u00bc 1 2 X ij ninj\u00bdhijjiji \u2212 hijjjii \u00bc 1 2 X ij ninjhijjjiji: \u00f08\u00de\nThe problem of optimizing the energy E\u00bdfnig; f\u03c7ig under the constraint P ni \u00bc N and with orthonormality conditions for the spin orbitals leads to the Lagrangian\n\u03a9\u00f0fnig; f\u03c7ig\u00de \u00bc E\u00bdfnig; f\u03c7ig \u2212 \u03bc X\ni\nni \u2212 N\n\u2212 X ij \u03bbij\u00f0h\u03c7ij\u03c7ji \u2212 \u03b4ij\u00de \u00f09\u00de\nwhere \u03bc and \u03bbij are Lagrange multipliers.

When the occupation numbers are close to 1 and 0 (dynamical correlation only)\nthe eigenvalues \u03f5i (the orbital energies) are expected to be close to the HF orbital energies. Once the eigenvalue problem is solved, we insert the eigenvalues \u03f5i into Eq. (12) to obtain\n\u03f5i \u00fe \u03ba\u00bdln ni \u2212 ln \u00f01 \u2212 ni\u00de \u00bc \u03bc: \u00f015\u00de\nNote that Gilbert\u2019s \u201cparadox\u201d of all \u03f5i being equal, \u03f5i \u00bc \u03bc, does not recur here; instead, the above equation leads to\nni \u00bc 1\n1\u00fe exp\u00bd\u00f0\u03f5i \u2212 \u03bc\u00de=\u03ba \u00f016\u00de\nwhich is just the Fermi-Dirac distribution. The Lagrange multiplier \u03bc is fixed by the sum rule P ni \u00bc N. The distribution ni can be updated from the eigenvalues \u03f5i immediately after the solution of the eigenvalue equations for the orbitals; no extra optimization procedure for ni is required. This makes the computation effort of this method nearly the same as the Hartree-Fock method. Since this variant of the density matrix functional method is based on entropy, with statistical mechanical and information theoretic connotations [25,26], we denote it here as i-DMFT. Investigations like the one by Levy [31] of scaling relations and constraints for Ecum\u00bd\u03b3 may offer a route to first-principles determination of \u03ba. Here we take a pragmatic approach. Since \u03ba controls the distribution fnig via Eq. (16) and so the entropy of Eq. (6) as well, one can simply determine \u03ba by fitting to the entropy of Eq. (6) from a wave function calculation at a single (e.g., equilibrium) geometry. In case the eigenvalue analysis of the 1RDM is not available from the wave function, there is another way to obtain \u03ba. Since the entropy at dissociation is larger than that at equilibrium geometry [30], doing i-DMFT calculations while varying \u03ba, one will get different estimates of Eeqcum \u2212 E\u221ecum, and so different values of the total energy difference Eeq \u2212 E\u221e \u00bc \u2212De. By comparing to the CI or experimental value ofDe, one can find the optimal value of \u03ba. Tables I and II of the Supplemental Material [36] lists such optimal values of \u03ba for H2 under different basis sets. As expected, there is some variation due to the different quality and dimension of the basis sets. The constant b is immaterial for orbital energies and energy differences such as De. One can start the i-DMFT calculation with any value of b. In case the absolute value of the energy is required, b can be simply obtained by calibrating to the CI or experimental value at some geometry. Figure 1 shows the E vs R curves of H2 from restricted HF, full CI (FCI), and the i-DMFT method. It is clear that the method reproduces the FCI curve very well and in particular avoids the notorious restricted HF problem of much too high energy in the dissociation limit. This problem is alleviated in (spin- and symmetry-restricted)\n013001-3\nlocal density approximation (LDA) and generalized gradient approximation (GGA) calculations, but is still serious with these density functional approximations [5]. The numerical data for H2 are collected in Table IV of the Supplemental Material [36]. It is to be noted that the errors around Re \u00bc 1.4 bohr are exceedingly small, indicating that Re and \u03c9e are reproduced very accurately. In Fig. 2 (and Table III of the Supplemental Material [36]) the occupation numbers of the 1\u03c3g and 1\u03c3u orbitals are displayed for both the i-DMFT method and the FCI methods. They are obviously very close. Apparently, the Fermi-Dirac distribution recovers these occupation numbers for the strong nondynamical correlation case almost perfectly. Figure 1 and Table V in the Supplemental Material [36] show the behavior of the orbital energies of both the HF and the i-DMFT methods as a function of R. These energies are close but not identical. The i-DMFT 1\u03c3g and 1\u03c3u orbital energies converge to the same value at a shorter distance (9\u201310 bohr) than the HF orbital energies do. The latter differ by a 1=R term which only slowly decays. This difference is important for the correct behavior of the occupation numbers in Fig. 2 which also become equal at 9\u201310 bohr. However, at long distance the orbitals do not have shapes close to the NOs. They are HF-like, and it is known the HF orbitals and density are too diffuse [37]. Further elucidation is given in the Supplemental Material [36]. Figure 3 shows the energy along the dissociation coordinate for the multiply bonded N2 molecule. The parameters \u03ba and b are fitted to reproduce the total energies at Re \u00bc 2.21 bohr and R \u00bc 10 bohr of the CI calculations. Again the i-DMFT curve closely follows the CI one. The corresponding numerical data are in Table VI of the Supplemental Material [36]. Since a FCI calculation and analysis is expensive, we approximate it with the MCSCF method using the Molpro package [38], in which eight\nelectrons are fixed in four closed-shell orbitals, while six electrons are correlated in 24 active orbitals. In our i-DMFT calculations, all 14 electrons are taken into consideration for correlation in all 30 orbitals available for the cc-pVDZ basis set. Table VII of the Supplemental Material [36] shows the occupation numbers at 10 bohr. Both i-DMFT and MCSCF methods demonstrate that each of the three broken bonds leads to two orbitals with ni \u223c 1.0 for the \u00fe and \u2212 combinations of the corresponding atomic orbitals. The water molecule has three internal coordinates: two O\u2500H bond lengthes (R1 and R2) and a bond angle (\u03b8). To see the performance of our method in water under various geometries, we compare the total energies of a few representative geometries with the MCSCF calculations in Table I. The equilibrium structure is around R1 \u00bc R2 \u00bc 1.82 bohr, while \u03b8 \u00bc 104o. The parameters \u03ba \u00bc 0.1109136 and b \u00bc 0.18121047 are fitted to the total energy\n013001-4\n(\u221276.241954) and the entropy (1.326550) at this geometry. The MCSCF values were done with eight electrons correlated in 23 active orbitals in the cc-pVDZ basis set. The i-DMFT calculations are done with all ten electrons correlated in all available orbitals. It is not immediately apparent that the present simple entropic Ansatz for the cumulant energy would also apply to the dispersion energy. This is a rather different type of correlation than the (nondynamical) mostly left-right correlation in a molecular bond, and the (dynamic) angular and in-out correlations in an atom. However, tests on the Van der Waals interaction energy curves for He2 and Ne2 led to potential energy minima (with almost correct well depths De and bond distance Re) even with a moderate basis set cc-pVTZ and choosing the parameter \u03ba around 0.11. Details will be reported elsewhere. We conclude that the i-DMFT method provides accurate potential energy surfaces. It achieves the incorporation of electron configuration effects along the complete dissociation coordinate at no more computational expense than an independent particle method like Hartree-Fock or KohnSham. In wave function methods electron correlation is brought in by adding more configurations. In view of the rapidly increasing number of possible configurations with system size (and primitive basis) many choices have to be made in order to keep the problem tractable. This concerns the level of the CI, as exemplified by strategies such as CCSD(T), or MR-CI, CASSCF, CASPT2, as well as the choice of active orbital space etc. The size of the problem increases rapidly anyhow. Here we do not need to make any distinction between active and inactive orbital space, or dynamical and nondynamical correlation. The involvement of the \u201cvirtual\u201d orbitals, which is a definite requirement to transcend the independent particle level, is governed by the occupation numbers [nonidempotency of \u03b3\u00f01; 10\u00de]. These occupation numbers follow a Fermi-Dirac distribution\nwhich is obtained directly from the variational problem for the orbitals and occupation numbers of the energy expression [Eq. (7)]. Here the correlation energy, which in DMFT is the two-electron cumulant energy [Eq. (4)], is brought in by the entropic Ansatz [Eq. (6)]. The power of this entropic correlation energy is that it leads to a simple SCF problem. The method is therefore efficient, and we have demonstrated it to be accurate as well.\n*jwang572@hotmail.com \u2020e.j.baerends@vu.nl\n[1] P. Hohenberg and W. Kohn, Phys. Rev. 136, B864 (1964).
