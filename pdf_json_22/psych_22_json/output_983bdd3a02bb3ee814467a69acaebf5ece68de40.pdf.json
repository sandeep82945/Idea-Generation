The aim of this study was to explore the risk factors influencing the development of SI and to develop and validate a nomogram among MSM.\nMethods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 915 MSM from Shanghai, Shenyang, Shenzhen and Kunming, China using the snowball sampling method. The integrated motivational-volitional (IMV) model of suicidal behavior was used as a theoretical framework to collect di erent potential influencing factors of SI including diathesis-environment-life events factors and psychosocial factors. The risk factors of SI were screened by logistic regression analysis, and a nomogram for predicting SI were developed. Model properties including discrimination, calibration and decision curves were evaluated to validate the prediction model.\nResults: 882 MSM were included in the statistical analysis, with a lifetime prevalence of SI of 34.4% (303/882). Logistic regression analysis showed that age group, sexual orientation disclosure, high-risk sexual behavior, entrapment, defeat and interpersonal needs were associated with SI. A nomogram was constructed based on the above six predictors. AUC values of ROC for prediction model were 0.761 (0.641\u20130.770) and 0.754 (0.565\u20130.822) in the training set (n = 662) and validation set (n = 220), respectively.

The nomogram can serve as a useful tool to predict the development of SI among MSM. Defeat, entrapment and interpersonal needs, as significant predictors of SI, can be measured to identify SI in advance. Early assessment of SI and the enhancement of psychosocial interventions are important to prevent suiciderelated behaviors. Future studies could incorporate more variables of interest to refine the prediction model to better guide behavioral and psychological intervention strategies among MSM.\nKEYWORDS\nmen who have sex with men, suicidal ideation, the integrated motivational-volitional model of suicidal behavior, nomogram, prediction model"

            "text": "Men who have sex with men (MSM) include gay men, bisexual men, heterosexual men, and transgender men (1). MSM, as a group of sexual minorities, are not legally recognized and socially supported because of their particular sexual orientation or same-sex sexuality. Stigmatized environment exposes MSM to discrimination, prejudice, social isolation and exclusion, stigma, abuse, violence and mental health disorders, etc (2, 3). As a result, MSM represent a vulnerable population with respect to suicide-related behavior which is a leading cause of death and disability and has become a serious threat to their health (4). It is essential to reduce the negative outcomes and the burden of disease through timely identification of suiciderelated behavior and interventions to prevent suicide.\nThe pathways to suicide are complex. Suicidal behavior goes through three phases: suicidal ideation (SI), suicide attempt (SA) and completed suicide. SI is defined as thinking about, considering or planning for suicide. SA is an intentional, selfinflicted, life-threatening act that results in bodily injury but not death (5). SI is considered as a precursor to suicidal behavior and an important predictor of suicide attempts and deaths (6). The people who expressed SI have higher risk of suicide than those without SI with a relative risk ratio (RR) of 4.17 [95% confidence interval (CI): 3.29-5.27] (7). Mathy found that MSM in South America, North America and Asia had 7.5, 2.1 and 2.9 times the risk of SI than heterosexual males, respectively (8). A systematic review reported a lifetime prevalence of SI among MSM in China was 21.2% (95% CI: 18.3\u201324.5%), much higher than the prevalence of the general population (P= 3.9%) (9) and male population (P = 6.4%) (10, 11). Given the high prevalence of SI and the important role of SI in the suicidal process, the assessment of SI is imperative among MSM.\nThe development of SI and transition from ideation to attempt should be viewed as distinct processes with different predictors according to the \u201cideation-to-action\u201d framework proposed by Klonsky and May (12). Therefore, Rory O\u2019Connor proposed the integrated motivational-volitional model (IMV) of\nsuicidal behavior and attempted to explain this issue (13). The IMV model, as a comprehensive theoretical model, integrates four theoretical models of suicide including diathesis-stress model, the theory of planned behavior (TPB), cry of pain theory of suicide and differential activation hypothesis (14\u201316).\nThe IMV model consists of three phases and delineates the detailed pathways to suicidal ideation and behavior. The pre-motivational phase describes the biopsychosocial context in which suicidal ideation and behavior may emerge. Vulnerability factors combined with diathesis\u2013environment\u2013 life events provide the backdrop for the generation of SI. The motivational phase describes the ideation/intention formation focusing on the psychosocial processes that may lead to the emergence of suicidal ideation and intent. The framework posits that SI begins with feelings of defeat (a sense of failed social struggle, losing social status, powerlessness or missing personal goals) and humiliation, and a sense of entrapment (there is no perceived escape) is the proximal predictor of SI (17). Thwarted belongingness (TB) and perceived burdensomeness (PB), as two important motivational moderators (MMs), moderate the association between the entrapment and SI. The volitional phase outlines volitional moderators (VMs) that govern the transition from SI to suicide attempts/death (16) (Figure 1).\nAccording to the IMV model, the potential risk factors of SI among MSM can be grouped into different phases. In the pre-motivational phase, some background factors such as age, race, education, employment status, income, and marital status may influence the development of SI (6). Sexual orientation is an important feature of MSM and there is strong evidence of association between suicide risk and bisexuality or homosexuality in males (19). A proportion of MSM choose to conceal their sexual orientation to avoid prejudice or discrimination. MSM are prone to high-risk sexual behaviors such as unprotected anal sex or multiple partners (20). Meanwhile, MSM have a higher rate of substances use like tobacco use, alcohol use and drug use than the general males (21). All these behaviors have the potential to act as triggering events leading to suicide-related outcomes.\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 02 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 1 The IMV model of suicidal behavior (18).\nNumerous studies have shown that psychological factors such as hopelessness, depression, anxiety and loneliness are all positively associated with SI (22\u201324). But more social support received from families and friends can protect MSM from the risk of suicide (25). People with SI tended to experience higher levels of defeat and entrapment than people without SI (26). Thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness, collectively known as interpersonal needs, are considered to be the psychological states in closest proximity to SI. However, the roles of entrapment, defeat and interpersonal needs in the development of SI among MSM remain to be explored.\nThere are quite a few studies that apply various methods including logistic regression analysis, structural equation model and syndemic theory to explore the prevalence and influencing factors of SI among MSM (4, 10, 23, 27). At present, the prediction models are mostly used for the diagnosis and prognosis of clinical diseases, and they have also been gradually applied in the field of behavioral psychology. Nomogram is widely used as a reliable tool to predict individual risk in reported outcomes by integrating diverse risk factors (28). Some studies have applied nomogram to predict SI and SA among depressed population (29, 30), adolescents (31), patients with cancer (32), showing good fitness to help implement individual strategies. However, no studies have applied the prediction model to predict the probability of SI among MSM. Therefore, this study aimed to use the IMV model as the theoretical framework to collect the diathesis-environment-life events and psychosocial factors that may affect the SI of MSM. Then we developed a nomogram using the potential predictors of SI, and evaluated its predictive ability."

The chisquare test or non-parametric test were used to explore whether the distribution of variables in two sets. We established a nomogram using the predictors selected from logistic regression analysis in the training set.\nFor the validation of the nomogram, we calculated discrimination, calibration and decision curve analysis (DCA) based on the training set and validation set. Discrimination can be measured by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the curve (AUC).

The calibration was presented by the calibration plot and Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. The closer the calibration plot is to the 45- degree diagonal line, the better the degree of calibration (45\u2013 47). The decision curve, which consists of threshold probability and net benefit (NB), was used to show the benefit of the prediction model. The larger the threshold probability and the net benefit value, the better the practicality of the model (48, 49).

The higher the level of defeat and entrapment, and the more unmet interpersonal needs, the greater the likelihood of developing SI. The concept of entrapment and defeat derived from the social rank theory of depression. Defeat arises from the moment of losing social status or failed struggle. A sense of entrapment arises when individuals are not capable of escaping from a threat or pressure and remain trapped. Internal entrapment comes from the individuals\u2019 thoughts and feelings, while external entrapment comes from the outside environment or others (17). The concept of interpersonal needs derived from the Interpersonal Psychological Theory of Suicide (IPTS) developed by Thomas Joiner (56). The theory holds that negative emotion occurs when people perceive themselves as a burden or when they feel disconnected from society, and the risk of SI is strongest especially when the perception of burden and frustration of belonging coexist (57). In the IMV model, entrapment and defeat are core roles in the generation of SI, and interpersonal needs act as motivational moderators to facilitate the shift from entrapment to SI (16).\nPrevious research has used the IMV model to validate that defeat is significantly associated with entrapment, and that entrapment and interpersonal needs are significantly associated with SI in Chinese adolescent samples (58). A study found that defeat and entrapment can predict SI and entrapment was a mediator between defeat and SI, which supported the structure of the IMV model (59). Likewise, bisexual and other (e.g., pansexual)-identifying sexual minority people reported higher levels of IMV-related outcomes (e.g., internal entrapment, defeat) (60). Minority stress theory suggests that MSM, as sexual minorities, suffer from external prejudice,\ndiscrimination (distal stressors) and internal stressors such as internalized homophobia and secrecy (proximal stressors), resulting in a higher risk of mental health problems compared to the general population (50). MSM may be more prone to defeat and entrapment due to external social pressures (e.g., prejudice, discrimination, stigma, etc.) and internal psychological pressures (e.g., rejection of their own sexual orientation). When individuals are estranged from society and their basic interpersonal needs are not met, they may perceive that their presence places a burden on family, friends and/or society (61). The mental health problems could co-occur and interact resulting in the development of SI and suiciderelated behaviors.\nPrediction model can integrate various predictors to provide insight into the effects of predictors in the model. The development and validation of prediction model are important. Discrimination and calibration are significant indicators of a prediction model, and take in account the full range of predicted risks. Discrimination reflects the ability of the model to distinguish the subjects based on the nomogram prediction and observed outcomes. Calibration refers to the agreement between observed endpoints and predictions (45, 46). Besides, decision curve is used to assess the clinical utility, i.e., the ability to make better decisions with a model than without (62). And it is suggested to consider a range of thresholds when quantifying the clinical utility of a prediction model (48). In this study, we established a nomogram using six predictors (age group, sexual orientation disclosure, high-risk sexual behavior, entrapment, defeat and interpersonal needs) and validated its good predictive ability through discrimination, calibration and decision curves. We sought to develop and refine a nomogram that could predict SI in order to identify suicidal ideation in advance and implement interventions to reduce suicide-related behaviors among MSM.\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 10 frontiersin.org"

            "text": "The lifetime prevalence of SI among Chinese MSM is high. The nomogram can serve as a useful tool to predict the development of SI among MSM. We should pay more attention to MSM who disclose their sexual orientation and have high-risk sexual behaviors. Defeat, entrapment and interpersonal needs, as significant predictors of SI, can\nbe measured to identify SI in advance. Early assessment of SI and the enhancement of psychosocial interventions are important to prevent suicide-related behaviors. Selfacceptance, reduction of stigma and burdensomeness, outside support, and reduction of prejudice and discrimination are important to protect the mental health of MSM. Future studies could incorporate more variables of interest to refine the prediction models to better guide behavioral\nFrontiers in PublicHealth 11 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 4 Calibration plots of suicidal ideation in the training set and validation set.

Therefore, further prospective studies are needed in the future to assess the causality between psychosocial variables and SI. Second, MSM are hard-to-reach and hidden populations, making it impossible to conduct random sampling, The snowball sampling method used in this study inevitably produced selection bias and sample representation problems. Expanding the sample size in subsequent studies could improve\nFIGURE 5 Decision curve analysis of suicidal ideation in the training set and validation set.

Third, the sample sizes of the four cities differed considerably and therefore cities were not included as independent variables in the statistical analysis. In the future, samples can continue to be collected across different cities to compare differences between cities. Finally, only one question was used in this study to measure the lifetime suicidal ideation of the participants, which is somewhat subjective. Multiple measurement instruments could be used in the future studies."
