conclusion In this paper, our aim is to enhance the performance of PLMs for the code search task during the finetune stage. To achieve this, we introduce several novel approaches. Firstly, we propose a cross-encoder for code search, which enhances the model’s capabilities compared to the typical dual-encoder. Next, we propose a retriever and ranker framework for code
search that balances both effectiveness and efficiency. Finally, we propose a probabilistic negative sampling method to further improve the retriever and ranker framework’s effectiveness. We conducted thorough experiments and found that our R2PS system significantly improves performance while incurring an acceptable extra computing cost.
