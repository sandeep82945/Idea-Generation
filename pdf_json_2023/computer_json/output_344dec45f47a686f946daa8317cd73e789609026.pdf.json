    "abstractText": "This paper introduces, to the best of our knowledge, the first quantum computing methodology for stochastic power flow. Stochastic power flow is widely used in power system operation and planning to study the impact of stochastic factors, such as uncertain generation, load, or contingencies, on power systems. Most standard approaches use Monte-Carlo simulations. In this paper, we focus on how the uncertainty of wind infeed affects the probability of line overloadings in a power grid. Quantum Monte Carlo approaches and the solution of linear systems have both been theoretically proven to be more computationally efficient than classical computing approaches. For example, Quantum Monte Carlo requires substantially fewer samples than Classical Monte Carlo to achieve the same accuracy. This paper presents the first formulation that exploits this quantum advantage to formulate a Quantum Stochastic Power Flow method. The developed method is tested for two small power systems and compared to classical simulations.",

INTRODUCTION\nThe increasing share of renewable energy sources (RES) in power systems creates a challenge to ensure system security and optimize future system planning. Weather-based energy sources, such as wind and solar, rely on forecasts that introduce some degree of uncertainty in the system operation. At the same time, with increasing distributed generation and adaptive loads, consumption patterns are also becoming more difficult to predict. This increasing uncertainty in both generation and consumption means that the number of possible operating scenarios grows exponentially, making it infeasible to evaluate them all. With systems being operated closer to their maximum, classical deterministic methods based on peak scenarios do not provide the full picture of the risk factors and can lead to a false dimensioning of the system. Methods to address stochastic power flow are becoming increasingly important in ensuring the security of the power system.\nSeveral Stochastic Power Flow (SPF) methods have been developed using classical computations [1], [2]. Monte Carlo simulations, based on random sampling, are commonly used to address these types of problem, but to achieve results with an acceptable confidence level, a large number of samples\nSubmitted to the 23rd Power Systems Computation Conference (PSCC 2024).\nare required. For SPF, [3] suggests that 10\u2032000 power flow samples are typically sufficient, but this can be computationally challenging for large power systems and especially when combined with a security assessment such as N-1. The emerging technology of quantum computing has the potential to become a powerful tool for power system applications.\nQuantum Computing (QC) has been shown to achieve significant speedups for certain computational problems compared to classical computers. For power systems, active research is focused on areas where QC can speed up computations and help alleviate computational bottlenecks. Several power flow applications based on the HHL algorithm [4] have been explored in [5], [6], [7]. Another area where QC shows great promise is Monte Carlo sampling. Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods have been theoretically proven to achieve the same confidence level using only \u221a N of the classically needed samples [8], indicating that a quantum-based SPF might require only 100 samples instead of the 10\u2032000 samples needed by the classical Monte Carlo approach. This means that if a quantum computer and a classical computer would take the same time to compute a power flow, applying Quantum Monte Carlo would lead to over 100x speedup. The computation gain would increase if more samples were necessary, e.g. for 100\u2019000 samples, the speedup would have been over 300x under the same assumptions. Of course, we can execute Classical Monte Carlo simulations in a High Performance Cluster taking advantage of the multiple CPUs, while real Quantum Computers are also not at the level of maturity yet (October 2023) to handle large power system problems. Considering, however, the rapid developments in Quantum Computing, and the significant, theoretically proven, computational advantages, this paper takes one of the first steps to design algorithms which can exploit the quantum advantage for real power systems in the near future.\nQuantum Monte Carlo is based on Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) algorithms and, so far, it has been mostly applied mostly for finance applications such as [9]. A common assumption with QAE is that the distribution being sampled is assumed to be known in advance. A challenge with truly achieving the speedup of QAE is to encode the relevant distribution as an unknown quantum state, or in our case to fully perform the SPF within the quantum computer.\nWe develop a quantum approach based on power transfer\n23rd Power Systems Computation Conference\nPSCC 2024\nParis, France \u2014 June 4 \u2013 7, 2024\nar X\niv :2\n31 0.\n02 20\n3v 1\n[ qu\nan t-\nph ]\n3 O\nct 2\n02 3\ndistribution factors (PTDFs)1 where, for each generator and load, a distribution of forecasted power with some degree of uncertainty is encoded into a quantum register. Next, unitary operations are performed according to the PTDFs of the system to convert the injection distributions to an unknown quantum state of the line flow distributions. Finally, we used a QMC method to estimate the characteristics of the resulting distribution to identify the probability of overloading the lines in the system. The full quantum application is validated using a simulated quantum computer, as the gate depth of the current implementation of the quantum circuit exceeds the capabilities of today\u2019s Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware; still, substeps of the algorithm are also tested and demonstrated using real hardware. The Python code developed for this paper is publicly available in a git repository [11].\nThis paper is organized as follows. Section II outlines the method developed. Section III gives a short introduction to quantum computing. Section IV describes the formulation of the stochastic quantum power flow. Section VI describes the simulation setup, the quantum hardware requirements, and provides the results of the power flow. In Section VII, we discuss potential issues with the scalability of the method and its future potential. Section VIII concludes."

These distributions are then loaded into a quantum computer, which computes the power flow in the system and maps a desired feature of the result into a specific quantum state, such as the risk of line overloading. This value is then estimated using QAE and the result is extracted to a classical computer. The process is described in Fig. 1 showing the steps of classical and quantum computations.\n1PTDFs are linear sensitivity factors which determine how a change in the bus power injections changes the line power flows. They are an exact reformulation of the DC Power Flow problem. For more information, the interested reader can refer to [10]."

This allows certain algorithms to perform exponentially faster than on classical computers. Only some basics of quantum computing are introduced here, but for more information, the reader is directed to [12]. Quantum computers operate with quantum bits (qubits) that differ from classical bits by being able to be in a superposition of both zero and one. Quantum states are typically written using the Dirac notation, where vectors are represented using a ket |v\u27e9, or a bra \u27e8v| which is the conjugate transpose of |v\u27e9. The state of the qubit can be represented as:\n|\u03c8\u27e9 = \u03b1 |0\u27e9+ \u03b2 |1\u27e9 , (1)\nwhere the amplitudes \u03b1 and \u03b2 are complex numbers that can be used for calculations. When the qubit is measured, it has the probability |\u03b1|2 of being zero and |\u03b2|2 of being one. If another qubit is added to the system, the number of amplitudes is doubled, meaning that the information contained in a combined quantum state scales exponentially with the number of qubits.

            "text": "Quantum mechanics is fundamentally linear [13], and so is quantum computing. This makes solving non-linear problems with QC a challenge. Previously proposed non-linear quantum power flow approaches [6], [7] require extracting the full solution from the quantum computer in each iteration, which cancels out any quantum speed-ups. Recent research indicates that approaches using mid-circuit measurements and classical feed-forward operations (often called dynamic circuits) show good promise in solving nonlinear systems [14]. However, for power flow applications, this area requires more research. To simplify our quantum stochastic power flow, we therefore use a modification of the linear DC power flow method to compute the line loading distributions of a system when we have a distribution of power inputs at the generator buses.\nIn DC power flow, a PTDF matrix can be constructed from the system susceptance matrix BB (when we remove the row and column corresponding to the slack bus) and the line-tobus susceptance matrix BF [10].

However, this can become computationally challenging, as the number of combinations scales exponentially with the number of buses. This is why classical Monte Carlo simulations are typically used to estimate the resulting distributions using a fixed number of random samples. However, as mentioned above, the information contained in a quantum register scales exponentially with the number of qubits, providing some interesting possibilities when working with probability distributions, and we aim to utilize this property for our application."

            "text": "Consider a simple power system with two generators like the one shown in Fig. 2. We define a quantum register B1 with Nqb qubits for bus 1. Using the superposition property of qubits, this register is used to encode the forecasted power, with some degree of uncertainty, of generator G1 as a probability distribution. The binary value of the quantum register is used to define the power value injected by the generator, and the amplitudes of the quantum state represent the probability of each value being generated. With Nqb = 2 qubits, it is possible to represent a probability distribution with Nbin = 2\nNqb = 4 bins, which can, for example, represent the probability of power generation in the range r = [0, 1, 2, 3] MW. The quantum state of this distribution is written as follows:\n|B1\u27e9 = b0 |00\u27e9+ b1 |01\u27e9+ b2 |10\u27e9+ b3 |11\u27e9 , (5)\nwhere b0 represents the probability that the generator produces 0 MW, b1 the probability that produces 1 MW, etc.\nFor an arbitrary power distribution PBi defined for bus i, the jth element can be defined as:\n|Bi\u27e9j = bj |PBi,j\u27e9 (6)\nThe combined amplitudes must satisfy that Nbin\u2211 j=0 |bj |2 = 1, which means that the distribution vector, PBi, of each bus must be normalized before constructing the quantum circuit, and the final result extracted from the quantum computer must then be re-scaled with the same factor. A power distribution using two qubits is shown in Fig. 3 along with the quantum circuit used. The circuit consists only of the basic gates available on current\nquantum hardware [15] to obtain an accurate estimate of the hardware requirements for our application, and the depth of the circuit is defined as the largest number of gates in each row (5 in this case).\nIn the same manner, a power distribution for bus 2 is encoded in a quantum register B2. The combined quantum state, |\u03c8\u27e9, then becomes the Kronecker product of the registers B1 and B2.\n|\u03c8\u27e9 = |B1\u27e9 \u2297 |B2\u27e9 (7)\nThis means that the quantum state |\u03c8\u27e9 contains every possible combination of the two input distributions.\nB. Applying PTDFs with quantum computing\nFor the scaled PTDFr matrix with elements hij , the percentage line loading of each line is calculated as a weighted sum of the bus injections\nLi = Nb\u2211 j=0 hijPB,j . (8)\nFor a larger system, the combined quantum state of bus injections, |\u03c8\u27e9 can be written as the Kronecker product of all bus distributions:\n|\u03c8\u27e9 = Nb\u2297 j=0 Bj (9)\nThe resulting power flow in line i corresponding to each amplitude in |\u03c8\u27e9, given the ith row of the PTDFr matrix, can be written as a weighted Kronecker sum of the bus distributions.\npfi = Nb\u2295 j=0 hijrPB,j , (10)\nwhere \u2295 represents the Kronecker sum of two vectors such that A\u2295B = A\u2297 eB +B\u2297 eA, where eA and eB are vectors of all ones with same lengths as A and B, respectively, and r is the megawatt range assigned to the amplitudes in the input registers (0-3 MW in our case).\nThe line flow values assigned to each amplitude in |\u03c8\u27e9 must now be arranged in an appropriate range in the quantum register. Since the input registers have a structured order, a matrix M , based on the elements of hi:, can be defined as:\n23rd Power Systems Computation Conference\nPSCC 2024\nParis, France \u2014 June 4 \u2013 7, 2024\n|L\u27e9 =M |\u03c8\u27e9 (11)\nTo constuct M , we can define the combined probability of a certain flow in line i as the sum of the quantum amplitudes that result in this flow. Each amplitude k in |L\u27e9 can be defined as:\n|L\u27e9k = \u2211 Nb\u2297\nj=0\nBj , where Nb\u2295 j=0 hijrPB,j = i  (12) Converting this into matrix form results in M being a sparse matrix with 2NbusNqb columns and up to 2NbusNqb rows, consisting of only zeros and ones.\nHowever, the matrix M is not a unitary matrix. To multiply it by the quantum state from (10) it must be decomposed into a product of unitary matrices. There are several ways of doing that, but for the type of matrix we get in (11), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) has been found to be effective. This decomposes the matrix M into two unitary matrices, U and V H , and a diagonal matrix, S, of singular values such that M = USV H . When applying SVD for an arbitrary matrix, the matrix, S, is usually not unitary. However, since each column in M only contains a single 1, by removing any zero rows from the matrix and normalizing the remaining rows, it can be converted to a semi-orthogonal matrix, so that MscMTsc = I . This ensures that the singular values of the matrix all become equal to one, resulting in S being an identity matrix that can be omitted in the quantum circuit. Given that M consists only of zeros and ones, the L2 norm for each row is the square root of the sum of columns. This scaling factor must then be reapplied later in the computation to achieve the correct result. This approach is a simplified version of the Gram-Schmidt process that is used to orthonormalize a set of vectors.\nMsc,i: = Mi:\n||Mi:|| (13)\nApplying SVD to the scaled matrix therefore decomposes it into a product of two unitary matrices Msc = UV H , which can be directly plugged into a quantum circuit as in Figure. 4.\nAn algorithm for constructing M for an arbitrary line hi: in the PTDFr matrix with an Nqb power distribution at each bus is shown in Algorithm 1.\nAlgorithm 1 Build Matrix Input hi:, Nbus, Nqb r = [0, 1, ..2Nqb \u2212 1] for j in range(Nbus) do Wvec = hij \u2217 r SM = SM \u2295Wvec\nend for for i in [0,..,max(|SM |)] do M [i, |SM | == i] = 1 end for return M"

It is therefore necessary to choose a specific aspect of the distribution which is relevant.\n1) Mean value: A value of interest could, for example, be the mean of the probability distribution. In quantum computing, getting the mean value of a state is commonly done by measuring the so-called expectation value. However, due to the scaling of Msc, the quantum encoded result is scaled. Therefore, the scaling factor of Msc must be reapplied to extract the correct result. This can be done by building a vector v, consisting of the line loading values multiplied by the scaling vector of Msc, the mean flow can then be calculated as:\nL\u0304 = vTL (14)\nTo implement (14) as a quantum circuit, vT must be converted to a unitary matrix. One way to do this is to use a Househoulder transformation [16] so that:\n|L\u0304\u27e9 = H |L\u27e9 (15)\nH = (I \u2212 2ww T\nwTw ) (16)\nw = v\n||v|| \u2212 e1 (17)\nChoosing e1 = [0, 0, ..., 1]T encodes the vector in the last row and column of H , resulting in the target value being encoded on the amplitude of the state |1\u27e9\u2297n.\n2) Probability of line overloading: Another interesting feature of the line flow distribution could be the probability that the line exceeds a specific load level. This can be computed using the same approach as before, using the Householder transform of a different vector v. Choosing ones as the weights for the line load values of interest (4+ in the example below), these probabilities will be summed up when applied onto the quantum state.

Monte Carlo methods are commonly used in these cases, where by drawing random samples one can get an estimate of the underlying distribution of the system. However, estimating a value with sufficient accuracy can require drawing a very large number of samples, which can also be computationally demanding. As mentioned above, for power system problems, between 10\u2019000 and 50\u2019000 samples are commonly used to achieve sufficiently accurate estimations. The number of required samples is usually more dependent on the shape of the distribution to be estimated and the desired accuracy than the actual size of the power system.\nQuantum Monte Carlo algorithms have been shown to achieve an estimate with the same confidence level using as little as \u221a N samples, where a classical algorithm would require N samples. Assuming that the quantum power flow can be executed in a time equivalent to or faster than the classical power flow methods, this would make the quantum SPF much faster than the classical SPF. The quantum equivalent of Monte Carlo is called Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE). Multiple algorithms have been developed to perform QAE, which differ in accuracy and hardware requirements. A comparison between some of the most common algorithms is provided in [17] with a focus on their use in power systems. In this paper, we choose to apply the implementation of the Iterative QAE (IQAE) algorithm [18] from Qiskit, which provides good accuracy and a good lower bound on the number of samples required, but has limitations for NISQ era hardware due to the required circuit depth."

The 3 bus system in Figure. 2 and the 5 bus system in Figure. 6. These systems therefore require 4 and 8 qubits, respectively.\nThe application is implemented using IBM Qiskit [19] and is first executed using a quantum computer simulator. In this way, we can demonstrate that the application will give accurate results on noise-free quantum computers. To compare the performance of the application in a simulated and real QC, the circuit for the three-bus system, shown in Fig. 5 was run in three stages. In each stage, all qubits were measured 1024 times to extract the probability distribution of the quantum states |\u03c8\u27e9, |L\u27e9 and |V \u27e9. The resulting histograms are shown in Fig. 7. In the first step, |\u03c8\u27e9, the real hardware result is very similar to the simulator. However, due to the required circuit depth of the next steps, the noise introduced by NISQ era hardware makes it challenging to get a satisfactory result without some form of error mitigation, which we have not included at this point. The total depth of the entire circuit, when transpiled for real hardware, is 863, which is not feasible today. For the five-bus system, the total depth is 264503 and it was therefore only executed on a simulator. In Fig. 7c, the value we are looking for is encoded in the probability of measuring |1111\u27e9 or 15, while the rest of the amplitudes are ignored. It is clear that the real hardware does not give an accurate result."

We need to apply a QAE algorithm to the circuit to estimate the amplitude of |1111\u27e9. We applied the standard implementation of IQAE from Qiskit, which iteratively applies the Grover operator to estimate the amplitude until the desired confidence level is achieved [18]. Results are shown for an estimate of a single line in both three- and five-bus systems in Tab. I and II. We estimate both the mean value of the line distribution and the probability that the line load exceeds 90%. The values estimated by IQAE clearly demonstrate the accuracy of the method. The method is set to estimate with a confidence interval 95% and an error of \u03f5 = 0.01. For classical Monte Carlo, the number of required samples is computed as follows:\nNCMCmin \u223c zc(\u03b1) 2s2n \u03f52 , (19)\n23rd Power Systems Computation Conference\nPSCC 2024\nParis, France \u2014 June 4 \u2013 7, 2024\nwhere zc(\u03b1) = 1.96 (according to the confidence interval) and the standard deviation is around sn = 0.754 (found classically) in the 3 bus case and 0.722 in the 5 bus case. It can be seen that IQAE is able to estimate the value with fewer samples than the classical methods in both cases. The number of samples taken by IQAE is returned by the algorithm and depends on how many times it has to run the circuit and the required power of the Grover operator. The overall runtime of SQPF is still slower than that of the classical approach, since we need to simulate the quantum computations classically."

However, the circuit depth required to run the application on real quantum computers is currently too high and scales poorly. With the noise introduced by NISQ-era hardware, it is challenging to achieve an accurate result. There is a clear need to explore ways to further reduce the required depth of the circuit to be able to efficiently scale the problem to larger power systems. An option with which we have had success is to use quantum Shannon decomposition [20]. This can, for example, reduce the depth of the circuit in Fig. 5 by a factor of two (also for the five-bus system). This method can be applied to arbitrary unitary matrices and results in a constant number of cnot gates depending on the matrix size. However, while it does provide an improvement in our case, it does not give the optimal solution, and given the features of the converted PTDF matrix, it is very likely that it can be further decomposed. This requires further investigation. Another approach to consider is to apply unitary approximation where we could sacrifice some accuracy for lower circuit depth. However, this must be considered carefully, as the secure operation of power systems is highly critical and inaccurate assessment methods could lead to costly over-dimentioning or even blackouts.\nIf the SQPF circuit can be split into smaller segments, the application of quantum error mitigation could be an interesting next step. If the noise can be sufficiently reduced, it might be possible to successfully run the application on real quantum hardware. This would bring us one step closer to utilizing the theoretical advantage of quantum computers.\nThe linear DC power flow, which we have adapted here for quantum computations, might not provide the greatest benefit for risk assessments. This is because classical computers can solve it very efficiently, and due to the assumptions made for the DC power flow, it might not be accurate enough in highly stressed scenarios. However, this approach provides an important step toward developing non-linear AC power flow applications, which will provide a huge advantage for future power system risk assessment. Non-linear quantum applications could also allow for a multitude of other power system assessment methods, which might be able to achieve quantum\n23rd Power Systems Computation Conference\nPSCC 2024\nParis, France \u2014 June 4 \u2013 7, 2024\nadvantage. Developing quantum applications for power systems requires us to reformulate our classical approaches to take advantage of the unique capabilities of quantum computers. This can be a challenging task, as quantum computers do not provide speed-ups for every type of problem. We must therefore focus our attention on the areas where quantum computers excel and how we can utilize them within power system applications."

To our knowledge, this method is the first of its kind and could potentially provide significant speedups for future power system analysis. Our method is based on classical DC power flow, where it transforms known power distribution into an unknown quantum encoded distribution of line loadings. This allows us to estimate the risk of line flow violations for a given wind power forecast, for example. We have demonstrated the accuracy of the SQPF and combined with Quantum Monte Carlo sampling, we have demonstrated that it can approximate the result with significantly fewer samples in two small test systems with very simple distributions. When applied to larger systems with more complex probability distributions, the benefits of SQPF are expected to become much greater. Of course, due to noise of today\u2019s quantum computers, it was not possible to demonstrate our method in a real QC. However, the speed of technological developments in quantum hardware and developments with error mitigation indicate that this will become possible in the near future. The work in this paper has taken the first step towards more practical quantum applications within power systems and using the same framework, we believe it can be extended towards non-linear applications which have the potential to deliver significant advantages for ensuring the secure operation of future power systems."
