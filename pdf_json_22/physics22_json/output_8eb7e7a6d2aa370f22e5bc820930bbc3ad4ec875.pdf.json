    "abstractText": "The muon capture reaction \u03bc + d\u2192 n + n + ]\u03bc in the doublet hyperfine state is studied using nuclear potentials and consistent currents derived in the chiral effective field theory, which are local and expressed in coordinate space (the so-called Norfolk models). Only the largest contribution due to the S0 nn scattering state is considered. Particular attention is given to the estimate of theoretical uncertainty, for which four sources have been identified: 1) the model dependence, 2) the chiral-order convergence for the weak nuclear current, 3) the uncertainty in the single-nucleon axial form factor, and 4) the numerical technique adopted to solve the bound and scattering A = 2 systems. This last source of uncertainty has turned out to be essentially negligible. For the S0 doublet muon capture rate \u0393D(1S0), we obtain \u0393D(1S0) 255.8(0.6)(4.4)(2.9) s, where the three errors come from the first three sources of uncertainty. The value for \u0393D(1S0) obtained within this local chiral framework is compared with previous calculations and found in very good agreement.",

Particular attention is given to the estimate of theoretical uncertainty, for which four sources have been identified: 1) the model dependence, 2) the chiral-order convergence for the weak nuclear current, 3) the uncertainty in the single-nucleon axial form factor, and 4) the numerical technique adopted to solve the bound and scattering A = 2 systems.

Since the theoretical inputs to study reaction (2) and reaction (1) are essentially the same, the comparison between the experiment and theory for muon capture provides a strong test for the pp studies.\nThe muon capture reaction (1) can take place in two different hyperfine states, f = 1/2 and 3/2. Since it is well known that the doublet capture rate is about 40 times larger than the quartet one (see, for instance, Ref. [1]), we will consider the f = 1/2 state only, and we will focus on the doublet capture rate, \u0393D. The experimental situation for \u0393D is quite confused, with available measurements which are relatively old. These are the ones of Refs. [2\u20135], 365 (96) s\u22121, 445 (60) s\u22121, 470 (29) s\u22121, and 409 (40) s\u22121, respectively. All these data are consistent with each other within the experimental uncertainties, which are, however, quite large. To clarify the situation, an experiment with the aim of measuring \u0393D with 1% accuracy is currently performed at the Paul Scherrer Institute, in Switzerland, by the MuSun Collaboration [6].\nMany theoretical studies are available for the muon capture rate \u0393D. A review of the available literature from up to about 10 years ago can be found in Ref. [7]. Here, we focus on the work conducted in the past 10 years. To the best of our knowledge, the capture rate \u0393D has been studied in Refs. [8\u201312]. The studies of Refs. [9, 11] were performed within the phenomenological approach, using phenomenological potentials and currents. In Ref. [9], the first attempt to use the chiral effective field theory (\u03c7EFT) was presented, within the so-called hybrid approach, where a phenomenological nuclear interaction is used in conjunction with \u03c7EFT weak nuclear charge and current operators. In the study we present in this contribution, though, we are interested not only in the determination of \u0393D but also an assessment of the theoretical uncertainty. This can be grasped more comfortably and robustly within a consistent \u03c7EFT approach. Therefore, we review only the theoretical works of Refs. [8, 10, 12], which were performed within a consistent \u03c7EFT. The studies of Refs. [8, 10] were essentially performed in parallel. They both employed the latest (at those times) nuclear chiral potentials and consistent weak current operators. In Ref. [8], the doublet capture rate was found to be \u0393D = 388.1 (4.3) s\u22121, when the NN chiral potentials of Ref. [13], obtained up to the next-tonext-to-next-to-leading order (N3LO) in the chiral expansion, were used. When only the 1S0 channel of the final nn scattering state was retained, it was found that \u0393D(1S0) 247.7(2.8) s\u22121. In Ref. [10], a simultaneous study of the muon capture on a deuteron and 3He was performed using the same N3LO chiral potentials, but varying the potential cutoff \u039b = 500, 600 MeV [13, 14], and consequently refitting consistently for each value of \u039b the low-energy constants (LECs) entering into the axial and vector current operators. For the muon capture on a deuteron, it was obtained \u0393D = 399 (3) s\u22121, the spread accounting for the cutoff sensitivity, as well as uncertainties in the LECs and electroweak\nradiative corrections. When only the 1S0 channel is considered, \u0393D(1S0) 254.9(1.4) s\u22121, where, in this case, the (small) uncertainty arising from electroweak radiative corrections is not included. In the case of the muon capture on 3He, an excellent agreement with the available extremely accurate experimental datum was found. Although obtained by different groups and with some differences in the axial and vector current operators adopted in the calculations, the results of Refs. [8, 10] for \u0393D and \u0393D(1S0) should be considered in reasonable agreement. It should be mentioned that in both studies of Refs. [8, 10], a relation between the LEC entering the axial current operator (denoted by dR) and cD, one of the two LECs entering the three-nucleon potential (the other one being cE) was taken from Ref. [15]. Then, the A = 3 binding energies and the Gamow\u2013Teller matrix element of tritium \u03b2decay were used to fix both cD (and consequently dR) and cE for each given potential and cutoff \u039b. Unfortunately, the relation between dR and cD of Ref. [15] is missing of a factor \u22121/4, as clearly stated in the Erratum of Ref. [10] (see also the Erratum of Ref. [15]). While the work of Ref. [8] has not yet been revisited, that of Ref. [10] has been corrected, finding very small changes in the final results, which become \u0393D = 398 (3) s\u22121 and \u0393D(1S0) 253.5(1.2) s\u22121.\nThe most recent and systematic study of reaction (1) in \u03c7EFT, even if only retaining the 1S0 nn channel, is that of Ref. [12]. There, \u0393D(1S0) was calculated using a pool of 42 non-local chiral potentials up to the next-to-next-to-leading order (N2LO), with a regulator cutoff \u039b in the range 450\u2013600 MeV and six different energy ranges in the NN scattering database [16]. The consistent axial and vector currents were constructed (with the correct relation between dR and cD), and a simultaneous fitting procedure for all the involved LECs was adopted. The final result was found to be \u0393D(1S0) 252.8(4.6)(3.9) s\u22121, in excellent agreement with Ref. [10]. Here, the first error is due to the truncation in the chiral expansion and the second one is due to the uncertainty in the parameterization of the single-nucleon axial form factor (see as follows). Furthermore, in Ref. [17], it has been found that a nonproper treatment of the infrared cutoff when the bound-state wave function is represented in a truncated basis (as in the case of Refs. [9, 10]) can lead to an error of the order of ~ 1% in the fewnucleon capture cross sections and astrophysical S-factors (as that of the pp reaction, the case studied in Ref. [17]). Therefore, we believe that it is also important to investigate this issue related to the present muon capture process.\nThe chiral nuclear potentials involved in all the aforementioned studies are highly non-local and expressed in momentum space. This is less desirable than the r-space in the case of the pp reaction, where the treatment in the momentum space of the Coulomb interaction and the higher-order electromagnetic effects is rather cumbersome. To overcome these difficulties, local chiral potentials expressed in the rspace would be highly desirable. These have been developed only in recent years, as discussed in the recent review of Ref. [18].\nFrontiers in Physics frontiersin.org02\nThese potentials are very accurate and have proven to be extremely successful in describing the structure and dynamics of light and medium-mass nuclei. In particular, we are interested in the work of the models of Ref. [19], the so-called Norfolk potentials, for which, in these years, consistent electromagnetic and weak transition operators have been constructed [20\u201322]. This local chiral framework has been used to calculate energies [23] and charge radii [24] and various electromagnetic observables in light nuclei, as the charge form factors in A = 6, 12 [24] and the magnetic structure of few-nucleon systems [22]. It has also been used to study weak transitions in light nuclei [25, 26], the muon captures on A = 3, 6 nuclei [27], neutrinoless double \u03b2-decay for A = 6, 12 [28] and the \u03b2-decay spectra in A = 6 [29], and, finally, the equation of the state of pure neutron matter [30, 31]. However, the use of the Norfolk potentials to study the muon capture on a deuteron and the pp reaction is still lacking. One of the aims of this work is to start this path. Given the fact that \u0393D(1S0) is the main contribution to \u0393D, and the 1S0 channel is also the only one of interest for pp fusion [32, 33], we focus our attention only on \u0393D(1S0). A full calculation of \u0393D, together with the rates for muon capture on A = 3, 6 nuclei, is currently underway. The second aim of the present study is to provide a more robust determination of the theoretical uncertainty than the work of Ref. [10], although probably not as robust as the full work presented in Ref. [12]. However, the procedure we plan to apply in the present work is much simpler and, as shown as follows, with a quite similar outcome. We will consider four sources of uncertainties: 1) the first one is due to model dependence. In this study, the use of the local Norfolk potentials will allow us to take into consideration the uncertainty arising from the cutoff variation, as well as the energy ranges in the NN scattering database up to which the LECs are fitted. In fact, as it will be explained in Section 2.2, we will employ four different versions of the Norfolk potentials, obtained using two different sets of short- and long-range cutoffs, and two different energy ranges, up to 125 MeV or up to 200 MeV, in the NN scattering database. 2) The second source of uncertainty arises from the chiral-order convergence. In principle, this should be investigated by maintaining the same order for potentials and weak nuclear currents. However, at present, the Norfolk potentials, for which weak current operators have been consistently constructed, are those obtained at N3LO. This chiral order is needed to reach good accuracy in the description of the NN systems and of light nuclei. Therefore, it is questionable whether a study of reaction (1) using potentials and currents at a chiral order which does not even reproduce the nuclear systems under consideration, would be of real interest. As a consequence, we will study, in the present work, only the chiral-order convergence for the weak nuclear currents, keeping fixed the chiral order of the adopted potentials. 3) The third source of uncertainty is due to the uncertainty in the parameterization of the single-nucleon axial form factor gA(q2\u03c3) as a function of the squared four-\nmomentum transfer q2\u03c3 . This aspect is discussed in detail in Section 2.2. Here, we only notice that the most recent parameterization for the single-nucleon axial form factor is given by\ngA q 2 \u03c3( ) gA 1 \u2212 16r2Aq2\u03c3 +/( ), (3)\nwhere the dots indicate higher-order terms, which are typically disregarded, and rA is the axial charge radius, its square being given by r2A 0.46(16) fm2 [34]. The large uncertainty on r2A will significantly affect the total uncertainty budget, as already found in Ref. [12]. 4) The final source of uncertainty is the one arising from the numerical technique adopted to solve the bound and scattering A = 2 systems. Taking into consideration the arguments of Ref. [17], we have decided to use two methods. The first one is the method already developed by Refs. [9, 10], i.e., a variational method, in which the bound and scattering wave functions are expanded on a known basis and the unknown coefficients of these expansions are obtained using variational principles. The second method is the socalled Numerov method, where the tail of the bound-state wave function is, in fact, imposed \u201cby hand\u201d (see Section 2.3). This last source of uncertainty will be shown to be completely negligible.\nThe paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the theoretical formalism, providing a schematic derivation for \u0393D(1S0) in Section 2.1, a description of the adopted nuclear potentials and currents in Section 2.2, and a discussion of the methods used to calculate the deuteron and nn wave functions in Section 2.3. The results for \u0393D(1S0) are presented and discussed in Section 3, and some concluding remarks and an outlook are given in Section 4."

Finally, in Eq. 7, the function \u03c81s represents the 1s solution of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the initial muonic \u03bc \u2212 d atom. Since the muon capture occurs in the region where the deuteron and the muon wave functions overlap, \u03c81s can be approximated as the average over the nuclear volume [9, 35], namely,\n|\u03c81s| \u2243 |\u03c8av1s | \u2261 |\u03c81s 0( )| \u03b1 \u03bc\u03bcd( )3 \u03c0 \u221a , (10)\nwhere \u03c81s (0) denotes the Bohr wave function for a point charge e evaluated at the origin, \u03bc\u03bcd is the reduced mass of the (\u03bc, d) system, and \u03b1 = 1/137.036 is the fine-structure constant.\nThe final nn wave function can be expanded in partial waves as\n\u03a8p,s1s2(nn) 4\u03c0\u2211 S \u23291 2 s1, 1 2 s2 | SSz\u232a\n\u00d7 \u2211 LLzJJz iLYLLz * (p\u0302)\u2329SSz, LLz | JJz\u232a \u03a8LSJJznn (p), (11)\nwhere \u03a8LSJJznn (p) is the nn wave function with orbital angular momentum LLz, total spin SSz, and total angular momentum JJz.

[9]. Since the weak charge and current operators have scalar/ polar-vector (V) and pseudo-scalar/axial-vector (A) components, each multipole consists of the sum of the V and A terms, having opposite parity under space inversions. Given that, in this study, only the 1S0 contribution is considered, the only contributing multipoles are C1(A), L1(A), E1(A), and M1(V), where the superscripts LSJ have been dropped. The integration of the matrix elements is performed using ~ 50 Gaussian points on the angles and a scaled grid on r with a maximum value rmax ~ 42 fm. This permits full convergence of the integrals, and the grid of r is large enough that all the low-energy components of the current become negligible.\nTo calculate the differential capture rate d\u0393D/dp in Eq. 4, we need to integrate over p\u0302. This is carried out numerically using the Gauss-Legendre method with a number of points of the order of 10 so that an accuracy of better than 1 part in 103 can be achieved. Finally, the total capture rate \u0393D is obtained as\n\u0393D \u222bpmax 0 d\u0393D dp dp, (15)\nwhere pmax is the maximum value of the momentum p. To find the smallest needed number of grid points on p to reach convergence, we computed the capture rate by integrating over several grids starting from a minimum value of 20 points up to a maximum of 80. We verified that the results obtained by integrating over 20 or 40 points differ by about 0.1 s\u22121, while the ones obtained with 40, 60, and 80 points differ by less than\nFrontiers in Physics frontiersin.org04\n0.01 s\u22121. Therefore, we have used 60 grid points in all the studied cases mentioned below."

            "heading": "2.2 Nuclear potentials and currents",
            "text": "In this study, we consider four different nuclear interaction models and consistent weak current operators derived in \u03c7EFT. We decided to concentrate our attention on the recent local rspace potentials of Ref. [19] (see also Ref. [18] for a recent review). The motivation behind this choice is that, in the future, we plan to use this same formalism to the pp reaction, for which the Coulomb interaction and also electromagnetic higher-order contributions play a significant role at the accuracy level reached by theory. The possibility to work in the r-space is clearly an advantage compared with the momentum space, which would be the unavoidable choice when using non-local potentials. However, in the momentum space, the full electromagnetic interaction between the two protons is not easy to be taken into account. The potentials of Ref. [19], which we will refer to as Norfolk potentials (denoted as NV), are chiral interactions that also include, beyond pions and nucleons, \u0394-isobar degrees of freedom explicitly. The short-range (contact) part of the interaction receives contributions at the leading order (LO), next-to-leading order (NLO), and next-to-next-to-next-toleading order (N3LO), while the long-range components arise from one- and two-pion exchanges, and are retained up to the next-to-next-to-leading order (N2LO). By truncating the expansion at N3LO, there are 26 LECs which have been fitted to the NN Granada database [36\u201338], obtaining two classes of Norfolk potentials, depending on the range of laboratory energies over which the fits have been carried out: the NVI potentials have been fitted in the range 0\u2013125 MeV, while for the NVII potentials, the range has been extended up to 200 MeV. For each class of potential, two cutoff functions CRS(r) and CRL(r) have been used to regularize the short- and long-range components, respectively. These functions have been defined as\nCRS r( ) 1\n\u03c0 3 2R3S\ne\u2212 r/RS( )2 , (16)\nCRL r( ) 1 \u2212 1 r/RL( )6e r\u2212RL( )/aL + 1, (17) with aL \u2261 RL/2. Two different sets of cutoff values have been considered, (RS; RL) = (0.7; 1.0) and (0.8; 1.2), and the resulting models have been labeled \u201ca\u201d and \u201cb,\u201d respectively. All these potentials are very accurate: in fact, the \u03c72/datum for the NVIa, NVIIa, NVIb, and NVIIb potentials are 1.05, 1.37, 1.07, and 1.37 [19], respectively. It should be noted that in Ref. [19], another set of NV potentials labeled NVIc and NVIIc was constructed, with (RS; RL) = (0.6; 0.8). The reason for not considering these potential models in this work is that they have been found to lead to a poor convergence in the\nhyperspherical harmonics method used to calculate the 3H and 3He wave functions needed to predict the Gamow\u2013Teller matrix element in tritium \u03b2-decay. This study is, in turn, necessary to fit the aforementioned dR LEC (see as follows and Ref. [20]). Therefore, for the NVIc and NVIIc potentials, consistent currents are not available, and we have disregarded them in this work.\nWe now turn our attention to the weak transition operators. When only the 1S0 nn partial wave is included, we have seen that the contributing multipoles are C1(A), L1(A), E1(A), and M1(V). Consequently, the weak vector charge operator is of no interest in the process under consideration, and we will not discuss it here. The weak vector current entering M1(V) can be obtained from the isovector electromagnetic current, performing a rotation in the isospin space, i.e., with the substitutions\n\u03c4 i,z/20\u03c4 i,\u00b1 \u03c4 i,x \u00b1 i\u03c4i,y( )/2, (18) \u03c4i \u00d7 \u03c4j( )z0 \u03c4i \u00d7 \u03c4j( )\u00b1 \u03c4 i \u00d7 \u03c4j( )x \u00b1 i \u03c4 i \u00d7 \u03c4j( )y. (19)\nTherefore, we will review the various contributions to the electromagnetic current, even if we are interested only in their isovector components. The electromagnetic current operators up to one loop have been most recently reviewed in Ref. [22]. Here, we only give a synthetic summary. Following the notation of Ref. [22], we denote withQ the generic low-momentum scale. The LO contribution, at the order Q\u22122, consists of the single-nucleon current, while at the NLO or order Q\u22121, there is the one-pionexchange (OPE) contribution. The relativistic correction to the LO single-nucleon current provides the first contribution of order Q0 (N2LO). Furthermore, since the Norfolk interaction models retain explicitly \u0394-isobar degrees of freedom, we take into account also the N2LO currents originating from explicit \u0394 intermediate states. Finally, the currents at order Q1 (N3LO) consist of 1) terms generated by minimal substitution in the fournucleon contact interactions involving two gradients of the nucleon fields and by non-minimal couplings to the electromagnetic field; 2) OPE terms induced by \u03b3\u03c0N interactions of sub-leading order; and 3) one-loop two-pionexchange terms. A thorough discussion of all these contributions as well as their explicit expressions is given in Ref. [22]. Here, we only remark that 1) the various contributions are derived in momentum space and have power\u2013law behavior at large momenta, or short range. Therefore, they need to be regularized. The procedure adopted here, as in Ref. [22], is to carry out first the Fourier transforms of the various terms. This results in r-space operators which are highly singular at vanishing inter-nucleon separations. Then, the singular behavior is removed by multiplying the various terms by appropriate rspace cutoff functions, identical to those of the Norfolk potentials of Ref. [19]. More details are given in Refs. [21, 22]. 2) There are 5 LECs in the electromagnetic currents which do not enter the nuclear potentials and need to be fitted using electromagnetic observables. These LECs enter the current operators at N3LO; in\nFrontiers in Physics frontiersin.org05\nparticular, two of them are present in the currents arising from non-minimal couplings to the electromagnetic field, and three of them are present in the sub-leading isoscalar and isovector OPE contributions. In this study, these LECs are determined by a simultaneous fir to the A = 2\u20133 nuclei magnetic moments and the deuteron threshold electrodisintegration at backward angles over a wide range of momentum transfers [22]. In this work, we used the LECs labeled with set A in Ref. [22].\nThe axial current operators used in the present work are the ones of Ref. [20]. They include the LO term of order Q\u22123, which arises from the single-nucleon axial current, and the N2LO and N3LO terms (scaling as Q\u22121 and Q0, respectively), consisting of the relativistic corrections and \u0394 contributions at N2LO, and of OPE and contact terms at N3LO. It should be noted that at NLO, here of orderQ\u22122, there is no contribution in \u03c7EFT. The explicit rspace expression of these operators is given in Ref. [20]. Here, we only remark that all contributions have been regularized at a short and long range consistently with the regulator functions used in the Norfolk potentials. Furthermore, the N3LO contact term presents a LEC, here denoted by z0 (but essentially equal to the dR LEC mentioned in Section 1), defined as\nz0 gA2 m2\u03c0 f2\u03c0\n1 m\u03c0RS( )3 \u2212 m\u03c0 4gA\u039b\u03c7 cD + m\u03c03 c3 + 2c4( ) + m\u03c0 6m [ ]. (20)\nHere, gA = 1.2723 (23) is the single-nucleon axial coupling constant, m = 938.9 MeV is the nucleon mass, m\u03c0 = 138.04 MeV and f\u03c0 = 97.4 MeV are the pion mass and decay constant, respectively, \u039b\u03c7 ~ 1 GeV is the chiralsymmetry breaking scale, and c3 = \u22120.79 and c4 = 1.33 are two LECs entering the \u03c0\u03c0N Lagrangian at N2LO and taken from the fit of the pion-nucleon scattering data with \u0394-isobar as explicit degrees of freedom [39]. As mentioned previously, cD is one of the two LECs which enter the three-nucleon interaction, the other being denoted by cE. The two LECs cD (and consequently z0) and cE have been fitted to simultaneously reproduce the experimental trinucleon binding energies and the central value of the Gamow\u2013Teller matrix element in tritium \u03b2-decay. The explicit values for cD are \u22120.635, \u22124.71, \u22120.61, and \u22125.25 for the NVIa, NVIb, NVIIa, and NVIIb potentials, respectively.\nThe nuclear axial charge has a much simpler structure than the axial and vector currents, and we have used the operators as derived in Ref. [40]. At LO, i.e., at the order Q\u22122, it retains the one-body term, which gives the most important contribution. At NLO (orderQ\u22121), the OPE contribution appears, which, however, has been found to be almost negligible in this study. The N2LO contributions (order Q0) exactly vanish, and at N3LO (order Q1), there are two-pion-exchange terms and new contact terms where new LECs appear. N3LO has not been included in the calculation, since the new LECs have not been fixed yet. However, we have found the contribution of C1(A) to be two orders of magnitude\nsmaller than the one from the other multipoles. Therefore, the effect of the axial current correction at N3LO can be safely disregarded.\nAll the axial charge and current contributions are multiplied by the single-nucleon axial coupling constant, gA(q2\u03c3), written as a function of the squared of the four-momentum transfer q2\u03c3 . Contrary to the triton \u03b2-decay, in the case of the muon capture on a deuteron, the four-momentum transfer is quite large. The dependence of gA(q2\u03c3) on q2\u03c3 is, therefore, crucial and, as already mentioned in Section 1, is a source of theoretical uncertainty in this study. In the past, it has been used for gA(q2\u03c3), a dipole form [9], but in Ref. [41], it has been argued that the dipole form introduces an uncontrolled systematic error in estimating the value of the axial form factor. Alternatively, it has been proposed to use the smallmomentum expansion, which leads to the expression of Eq. 3. In our study, we decided to use the new parameterization for gA(q2\u03c3) of Eq. 3, but with a slightly smaller uncertainty on the axial charge radius rA compared with Ref. [41], as discussed in Ref. [34]. In this work, rA has been chosen as the weighted average of the values obtained by two independent procedures having approximately the same accuracy, about 50%. One procedure is the one of Ref. [41] and used for the axial form factor a convergent expansion given by\ngA q 2 \u03c3( ) \u2211kmax\nk 0 akz q\n2 \u03c3( )k, (21)\nwhere the variable z(q2\u03c3) is defined as\nz q2\u03c3( ) tcut \u2212 q2\u03c3\u221a \u2212 tcut \u2212 t0\u221a tcut \u2212 q2\u03c3\u221a + tcut \u2212 t0\u221a , (22) with tcut 9 m2\u03c0 and \u2212\u221e < t0 < tcut. In Eq. 21, ak is the expansion parameters that encode the nuclear structure information and need to be experimentally fixed. From gA(q2\u03c3) in Eq. 21, we can obtain r2A as [41]\n1 6 r2A \u2261 1 gA 0( ) dgA q2\u03c3( ) dq2\u03c3 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 q2\u03c3 0 . (23)\nThe value for r2A is obtained by fitting experimental data of neutrino scattering on a deuterium and is found to be r2A(z exp.]) 0.46(22) fm2 [41]. Alternatively, it is possible to obtain r2A from experiments on muonic capture on protons, as carried out by the MuCap Collaboration. To date, these experiments are characterized by an overall accuracy of 1%, but a future experiment plans to reduce this uncertainty to about 0.33% [34]. In this case, r2A(MuCap) 0.46(24) fm2 [34]. In order to take into account both r2A(z exp.]) and r2A(MuCap), we adopted for r2A the value r2A 0.46(16) fm2, as suggested in Ref. [34]. The uncertainty on r2A remains quite large, at about 35%, but it is slightly smaller than the one of Ref. [41], which has been adopted in the study of Ref. [12]. The consequences on the error budget are discussed in Section 3. We finally notice that the dipole\nFrontiers in Physics frontiersin.org06\nfunction for gA(q2\u03c3), with a cutoff value of \u039bA = 1 GeV as used, for instance, in Refs. [9, 10], can be reduced to Eq. 3 by imposing r2A 0.467 fm2."

Consequently, it can be written as a linear combination of regular (Bessel) and irregular (Neumann) spherical functions, denoted as jL(pr), nL(pr), respectively, i.e.,\n\u03a8a p( ) ~FL pr( )Y\u03b1 r\u0302( ) + \u2211 L\u2032 RLL\u2032 ~GL\u2032 pr( )Y\u03b1\u2032 r\u0302( ), (29)\nwhere RLL\u2019 is the reactance matrix, and ~FL\u2032(pr) and ~GL\u2032(pr) are defined as\n~FL\u2032 pr( ) \u2261 jL pr( )pL , (30) ~GL\u2032 pr( ) \u2261 nL pr( ) 1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03f5r( )2L+1pL+1, (31)\nso that they are well defined for p \u2192 0 and r \u2192 0. The function (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03f5r)2L+1 was found to be an appropriate regularization factor at the origin for nL (pr). We use the value \u03f5 = 0.25 fm\u22121 as in Ref. [9]. It should be noted that since L = L\u2032 = 0 the reactance matrix is, in fact, just a number here, and R00 = tan \u03b40, \u03b40 being the phase shift.\nTo determine the coefficients di(p) in Eq. 28 and the reactance matrix RLL\u2019 in Eq. 29, we use the Kohn variational principle [43], which states that the functional\nRLL\u2032 p( )[ ] RLL\u2032 p( ) \u2212 mn Z2 \u2329 \u03a8\u03b1\u2032 p( )|H \u2212 E| \u03a8\u03b1 p( )\u232a (32) is stationary with respect to di(p) and RLL\u2019. In Eq. 32, E is the nn relative energy (E = p2/mn, mn being the neutron mass) and H is the Hamiltonian operator. Performing the variation, a system of linear inhomogeneous equations for di(p) and a set of algebraic equations for RLL\u2019 are derived. These equations are solved by standard techniques. The variational results presented in the following section are obtained using M = 35 for both the deuteron and the nn scattering wave functions.\nTo test the validity of the variational method and its numerical accuracy, in this work, we also used the Numerov method for the deuteron and the nn wave functions.\nFor the deuteron wave function, we used the so-called renormalized Numerov method, based on the work of Ref. [44]. Within this method, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is rewritten as\nI d2 dx2 + Q x( )[ ]\u03a8 x( ) 0, (33)\nwhere I is the identity matrix and Q(x) is a matrix defined as\nQ x( ) 2\u03bc Z2 ( ) EI \u2212 V x( )[ ], (34) and \u03a8(x) is also a matrix whose columns are the independent solutions of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation with non-assigned boundary conditions on the derivatives. In Eq. 34, \u03bc is the np\nFrontiers in Physics frontiersin.org07\nreduced mass, E \u2261 \u2212 Bd, and V(x) is the sum of the np nuclear potential Vnp(x) and the centrifugal barrier, i.e.,\nV x( ) Vnp x( ) + Z 2l l + 1( ) 2\u03bcr2 . (35)\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation is evaluated on a finite and discrete grid with a constant step h. The boundary conditions require knowing the wave function at the initial and final grid points, given by x0 = 0 and xN = Nh, respectively. Specifically, it is assumed that \u03a8(0) = 0 and \u03a8(Nh) = 0. No conditions on first derivatives are imposed. Equation 33 can be rewritten equivalently as [44]\nI \u2212 T xn+1( )[ ]\u03a8 xn+1( ) \u2212 2I + 10T xn( )[ ]\u03a8 xn( ) + I \u2212 T xn\u22121( )[ ]\u03a8 xn\u22121( ) 0, (36)\nwhere xn \u2208 A, A \u2261 (x0, xN), and T (xn) is a 2 \u00d7 2 matrix defined as [44]\nT xn( ) \u2212 h 2\n12 Q xn( ). (37)\nIt should be noted that Eq. 36 is, in fact, the natural extension to a matrix formulation of the ordinary Numerov algorithm (see Eq. 65 as follows). By introducing the matrix F (xn) as [44]\nF xn( ) I \u2212 T xn( )[ ]\u03a8 xn( ), (38)\nEquation 36 can be rewritten as\nF xn+1( ) \u2212 U xn( )F xn( ) + F xn\u22121( ) 0, (39) where the matrix U (xn) is given by\nU xn( ) I \u2212 T xn( )[ ]\u22121 2I + 10 T xn( )[ ]. (40)\nFurthermore, we introduce the matrices R (xn) and R\u0302(xn), defined as [44]\nR xn( ) F xn+1( )F\u22121 xn( ), (41) R\u0302 xn( ) F xn\u22121( )F\u22121 xn( ), (42)\nand their inverse matrices as\nR\u22121 xn( ) F xn( )F\u22121 xn+1( ), (43) R\u0302 \u22121\nxn( ) F xn( )F\u22121 xn\u22121( ). (44) By using definitions (41) and (42), it is possible to derive from Eq. 39 the following recursive relations:\nR xn( ) U xn( ) \u2212 R\u22121 xn\u22121( ), (45) R\u0302 xn( ) U xn( ) \u2212 R\u0302\u22121 xn+1( ). (46)\nWe now notice that, since \u03a8(0) = 0, Eq. 38 implies that F (0) = 0 and, consequently, from Eq. 43, it follows that R\u22121 (0) = 0.\nSimilarly, since \u03a8(Nh) = 0, from Eqs 38, 44 we obtain R\u0302 \u22121(Nh) 0. Starting from the R\u22121(0) and R\u0302\u22121(Nh) values, and iteratively using Eqs 45, 46, it is possible to calculate the R (xm) and R\u0302 \u22121(xm+1) values up to a matching point xm, so that the interval A remains divided into two subintervals, A1 \u2261 [x0, xm+1] and A2 \u2261 [xm, xN]. These values are needed to calculate the deuteron binding energy and its wave function. In fact, assuming we knew the deuteron binding energy Bd \u2261 \u2212 E for a given potential, then we could integrate Eq. 33 in the two sub-intervals A1 and A2, obtaining the outgoing (left) solution \u03a8l (xn) in A1, and the incoming (right) solution \u03a8r (xn) in A2. If Bdwere a true eigenvalue, then the function\u03a8(xn) and its derivative have to be continuous in xm. The wave function continuity at two consecutive points, for example, xm and xm+1, implies that\n\u03a8l xm( ) \u00b7 l \u03a8r xm( ) \u00b7 r \u2261 \u03c8 xm( ), (47) \u03a8l xm+1( ) \u00b7 l \u03a8r xm+1( ) \u00b7 r \u2261 \u03c8 xm+1( ), (48)\nwhere l and r are two unknown vectors. Multiplying Eq. 48 by [I \u2212 T(xm+1)] and using Eq. 38, we obtain Fl xm+1( ) \u00b7 l Fr xm+1( ) \u00b7 r \u2261 f xm+1( ). (49)\nSimilarly, from Eq. 47, we can write\nFl xm( ) \u00b7 l Fr xm( ) \u00b7 r \u2261 f xm( ). (50)\nUsing Eq. 41 with xn = xm for the outgoing solution and Eq. 42 with xn = xm+1 for the incoming solution, we can write\nFl xm+1( ) R xm( )Fl xm( ), (51) Fr xm+1( ) R\u0302\u22121 xm+1( )Fr xm( ). (52)\nBy replacing Eqs 51, 52 with Eq. 49 and using Eq. 50, we obtain that\nR xm( )f xm( ) R\u0302\u22121 xm+1( )f xm( ) (53) or equivalently that R xm( ) \u2212 R\u0302\u22121 xm+1( )[ ]f xm( ) 0. (54) A non-trivial solution is only admitted if the aforementioned equation satisfies the following condition: det R xm( ) \u2212 R\u0302\u22121 xm+1( )[ ] 0. (55) This determinant is a function of the energy E, i.e., det E( ) det R xm( ) \u2212 R\u0302\u22121 xm+1( )[ ]. (56) Therefore, we proceed as follows: starting from an initial trial value E1, we calculate det (E1). Fixing a tolerance factor \u03f5, for example \u03f5 = 10\u201316, if det (E1) \u2264 \u03f5, we assume E1 being the eigenvalue, otherwise we compute the determinant for a second\nFrontiers in Physics frontiersin.org08\nenergy value E2. If det (E2) \u2264 \u03f5, we take the deuteron binding energy as Bd = \u2212E2, otherwise it is necessary to repeat the procedure iteratively until det (Ei) \u2264 \u03f5. For the iterations after the second one, the energy is chosen through the relation\nEi Ei\u22122 \u2212 det Ei\u22121( ) Ei\u22122 \u2212 Ei\u22121det Ei\u22122( ) \u2212 det Ei\u22121( ), (57)\nwhich follows from a linear interpolation procedure. The procedure stops when det (Ei) \u2264 \u03f5, and the deuteron binding energy is taken to be Bd = \u2212Ei.\nTo calculate the S- and D-wave components of the reduced radial wave function, denoted as u0 (xn) and u2 (xn), respectively, we notice that they are the two components of the vector \u03c8(xn), defined in Eq. 47 at the point xm. The starting point is to assign an arbitrary value to one of the two components of the vector function f (xm) (see Eq. 50). Since R (xm) and R\u0302 \u22121(xm+1) are known, the value of the other component is fixed by Eq. 54. By defining the outgoing function as f (xn) = F (xn) \u00b7l, from Eq. 41, it follows that\nf xn( ) R\u22121 xn( )f xn+1( ), (58)\nwhere n = m \u2212 1, . . ., 0. Similarly, we can proceed with the incoming function. By defining it as f (xn) = F (xn) \u00b7r, from Eq. 42 we have\nf xn( ) R\u0302\u22121 xn( )f xn\u22121( ), (59) where n = m + 1, . . ., N. At this point, the vector function f (xn) can be calculated \u2200 xn \u2208 [x0, xN], through Eqs 58, 59. The u0 (xn) and u2 (xn) functions are given from f (xn) by\n\u03c8 xn( ) I \u2212 T xn( )[ ]\u22121f xn( ). (60)\nFinally, the deuteron wave function is normalized to unity.\nThe single-channel Numerov method, also known as a three-point algorithm, is used to calculate the nn wave function. Although the method is quite well known, to provide a comprehensive review of all the approaches to the A = 2 systems, we briefly summarize its main steps. Again, we start by defining a finite and discrete interval I, with constant step h, characterized by the initial and final points, x0 = 0 and xN = Nh, respectively. Then, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be cast in the form\nu\u2033 xn( ) \u2261 d 2 u x( ) dx2 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223x xn W xn( )u xn( ), (61) where\nW xn( ) 2\u03bc Z2 ( )V xn( ) \u2212 p2, (62) with V (xn) being the nuclear potential and p the nn relative momentum. To solve Eq. 61, it is convenient to introduce the function z (xn), defined as\nBy replacing Eq. 61 with Eq. 63, z (xn) can be rewritten as\nz xn( ) 1 \u2212 h 2 12 W xn( )( )u xn( ). (64)\nBy expanding z (xn\u22121) and z (xn+1) in an interval around the point xn in a Taylor series up to O (h 4), and adding together the two expressions, we obtain z xn+1( ) 2z xn( ) \u2212 z xn\u22121( ) + h2u\u2033 xn( ) + O h6( ). (65) This is a three-point relation: once the z (xn\u22121) and z (xn) values are known, after calculating u\u2033(xn) using Eq. 61, we can compute z (xn+1) at the order O (h 6). By fixing the values u (0) = 0 and u(h) = h, we consequently know z (0) and z(h), i.e.,\nu 0( ) 00z 0( ) 0, (66)\nu h( ) h0z h( ) 1 \u2212 h 2 12 W h( )( )u h( ), (67)\nand u\u2033(h) is obtained by Eq. 61. Then, z (2h) is obtained from Eq. 65, and consequently,\nu 2h( ) z 2h( ) 1 \u2212 h2/12( )W 2h( )[ ], (68)\nwhereW (2h) is given by Eq. 62. Equation 68 can be used again to determine the u(3h) value, and, proceeding iteratively, the S-wave scattering reduced radial wave function is fully determined except for an overall normalization factor. This means that for a sufficiently large value of xn \u2208 A, denoted as x n, we can write u x n( ) N j0 kx n( ) + tan \u03b40 n0 kx n( )[ ], (69) where N is the sought normalization constant, and the phase shift \u03b40 can be computed by taking the ratio between Eq. 69 written for x n and the same equation written for xm, m being close to n so that"

In the table, we can see an excellent agreement between the two methods, with a difference well below 1 keV for the binding energies. The phase shifts calculated with the two methods are also in excellent numerical agreement. Furthermore, Figure 1 shows the deuteron and the nn wave functions, still at E = 5 MeV as an example, for the NVIa potential. The results obtained with the other chiral potentials present similar behavior. In the figure, we can see that the variational method fails to reproduce the u0(r) function for r > 20 fm. However, it\nshould be noticed that in this region, the function is almost two orders of magnitude smaller than in the dominant range of r ~ 0\u20135 fm. As we will see in the following section, we already anticipate that these discrepancies in the deuteron wave functions will have no impact on the muon capture rate."

            "text": "We present, in this section, the results for the \u0393D(1S0) muon capture rate, obtained using the Norfolk potentials and consistent currents, as presented in Section 2.2. In particular, we will use the four Norfolk potentials NVIa, NVIb, NVIIa, and NVIIb, obtained varying the short- and long-range cutoffs (models a or b), and the range of laboratory energies over which the fits have been carried out (models I or II). For each model, the weak vector current and the axial current and the charge operators have been consistently constructed. In particular, we will indicate with the label LO those results obtained including only the LO contributions in the vector current and axial current and charge operators, and with NLO those obtained including, in addition, the NLO contributions to the vector current and axial charge\nFIGURE 1 Deuteron u0(r) (left top panel) and u2(r) (right top panel) functions, and the nn 1S0 function (left bottom panel) at E =5 MeV are calculated with the variational (dashed red line) and the Numerov (black solid line) methods. The NVIa potential is used. To appreciate the differences between the two methods, the function u0(r) and u2(r) are shown in a semilogarithmic scale.\nFrontiers in Physics frontiersin.org10\noperators. We remind the reader that there are no NLO contributions to the axial current. With the label N2LO we will indicate those results obtained including the N2LO terms of the vector and axial currents, but not the axial charge since they vanish exactly. Finally, with N3LO we will indicate the results obtained when N3LO terms in the vector and axial currents are retained. It should be noted that this is the order in which new LECs appear. The contributions at N3LO for the axial charge are, instead, discarded for the reasons explained in Section 2.2. Finally, we will use the dependence given in Eq. 3 with gA = 1.2723 and r2A 0.46 fm2 for the axial single-nucleon form factor. However, to establish the uncertainty arising from the rather poor knowledge of r2A (see Ref. [34] and the discussion in Section 1 and at the end of Section 2.2), we\nwill also show results obtained with r2A 0.30, 0.46, 0.62 fm2, so that the 0.16 fm2 uncertainty on r2A [34] will be taken into account.\nFirst, we begin by proving that the uncertainty arising from the numerical method adopted to study the deuteron and the nn scattering states is well below the 1% level. In fact, Table 2 shows the results obtained with the NVIa potential and currents with up to N3LO contributions, using either the variational or the Numerov method to solve the two-body problem (see Section 2.3). The function d\u0393D(1S0)/dp (see Eq. 4) calculated with the same potential and currents is shown in Figure 2. As the figure and the table show, the agreement between the results obtained with the two methods is essentially perfect, of the order of 0.01 s\u22121 in \u0393D(1S0), well below any other source of error (\u2243 0.005%). Therefore, from now on, we will only present results obtained using the variational method, which is numerically less involved than the Numerov one.\nTable 3 shows the results for \u0393D(1S0), obtained using all four Norfolk potentials, NVIa, NVIb, NVIIa, and NVIIb, and consistent currents, from LO up to N3LO. The axial charge radius is fixed at r2A 0.46 fm2. As seen in the table, we can provide our best estimate for \u0393D(1S0), which we calculate simply as the average between the four values at N3LO, \u0393D(1S0) 255.8 s\u22121. Furthermore, we would like to remark that the overall model dependence is quite small, the largest difference being of the order of 1.1 s\u22121 between the NVIa and NVIIb results, at N3LO. Going into more detail, 1) by comparing the NVIa (NVIIa) and NVIb (NVIIb) results, still at N3LO, we can get a grasp on the cutoff dependence, which turns out to be smaller than 1 s\u22121 for both models I and II. 2) By comparing the NVIa (NVIb) and NVIIa (NVIIb) results, again at N3LO, we can conclude that the dependence on the NN database used for the LECs\u2019 fitting procedure for the potentials is essentially of the same order. To remain conservative, we decided to define the theoretical uncertainty arising from model dependence as the half range, i.e.,\nFIGURE 2 Differential doublet capture rate in the 1S0 nn channel, d\u0393D(1S0)/dp in s\u22121MeV\u22121, as a function of the nn relative momentum p in MeV, calculated using either the Numerov (black solid line) or the variational (red dashed line) methods in order to obtain the deuteron and the nn scattering wave functions.

(72) From this, we obtain \u0394\u0393D(1S0)[mod \u2212 dep] 0.6 s\u22121. We want to remark that this estimate of \u0394\u0393D(1S0)[mod \u2212 dep] does not take into account the error on the fit of the nuclear interaction\u2019s LECs or its chiral truncation. Therefore, it should be considered just as a lower bound of the actual uncertainty.\nFrom Table 3, we can conclude that the chiral-order convergence seems to be quite well under control for all the potential models. In fact, in going from LO to NLO, \u0393D(1S0) has increased by 2.2 s\u22121 for the a models, and 2.5 s\u22121 and 2.4 s\u22121 for the models NVIb and NVIIb, respectively. This small change is because the only correction appearing at NLO comes from the vector current. Passing fromNLO toN2LO, the muon capture rate increases by 7.1 s\u22121 for the interactions NVIa and NVIIa, and 11.5 s\u22121 and 11.3 s\u22121 for the models NVIb and NVIIb, respectively. This can be understood considering that the terms with the \u0394isobar contributions appear at this order for the vector and axial current. The convergence at N3LO shows instead a more involved behavior: for the models NVIa and NVIIa, an \u0393D(1S0) increase of 0.6 s\u22121 and 0.9 s\u22121, respectively, while for the models NVIb and NVIIb, the muon capture rate decreases by 3.5 s\u22121 and 3.9 s\u22121, respectively. Even if the results are in reasonable agreement with the expected chiral convergence behavior (in particular for the models a), the chiral convergence of the current shows a significant dependence on the regularization that we tracked back to the axial current corrections and in particular to the different value of the constant cD (see Section 2.2). We still find remarkable that the results at N3LO obtained with the various potentials, even if their\nchiral convergence patterns are quite different, turn out to be within 1.1 s\u22121.\nThe theoretical uncertainty arising from the chiral-order convergence of the nuclear weak transition operators can be studied using the prescription of Ref. [45]. Here, we report the formula for the error at N2LO only. At this order, for each energy, we define the error for the differential capture rate (to simplify the notation from now on we use \u0393D(p) d\u0393D(1S0)/dp), as\n\u0394\u0393D p( ) \u2261 max Q3|\u0393DLO p( )|, Q2|\u0393DNLO p( ) \u2212 \u0393DLO p( )|,{ Q|\u0393DN2LO p( ) \u2212 \u0393DNLO p( )|}, (73)\nwhere we assumed\nQ 1\u039b p8 +m8\u03c0 p7 +m7\u03c0\n(74)\nas in Ref. [46] for the case of the np\u2194 d\u03b3 reaction. Here, p is the relative momentum of the nn system and we assume a value of \u039b \u2243 550 MeV, which is of the order of the cutoff of the adopted interactions. Analogous formulas have been used to study the other orders (see Ref. [45] for details).\nIn Figure 3, we show the error on d\u0393D(1S0)/dp order by order in the expansion of the nuclear current up to N3LO for the NVIa interaction. From the figure, the nice convergence of the chiral expansion of the currents is evident. The total error arising from the chiral truncation of the currents on \u0393D(1S0) is then computed by integrating the error of the differential capture rate over p, namely,\n\u0394\u0393D 1S0( ) curr \u2212 conv[ ] \u222bpmax 0 \u0394\u0393D p( )dp. (75) Note that here we assumed the distribution of the truncation error to be uniform, this being a systematic error. Therefore, we do not square it in Eq. 75. Table 3 also shows for each order the error relative to the chiral truncation of the electroweak currents. To be the most conservative as possible, we keep as error the largest obtained with the various interaction models. In the same spirit, we consider the error computed at N2LO, since the calculation at N3LO does not contain all the contributions of the axial charge (see discussion Section\nFIGURE 3 Differential doublet capture rate in the 1S0 nn channel, d\u0393D(1S0)/dp in s\u22121MeV\u22121, as a function of the nn relative momentum p in MeV, calculated order by order with the relative errors computed following the prescription of Ref. [45]. The axial charge radius is taken to be r2A 0.46 fm2.\nFrontiers in Physics frontiersin.org12\n2.2). Therefore, we obtain \u0394\u0393D(1S0)[curr \u2212 conv] 4.4 s\u22121. In comparison, the same calculation at N3LO would give as an error \u0394\u0393D(1S0)[curr \u2212 conv]|N3LO 1.4 s\u22121. We want to remark that the uncertainty computed here arises only from the chiral truncation of the currents and it represents only a lower bound of the total chiral error.\nFinally, Table 4 shows the results obtained with all the interactions and consistent currents up to N3LO for the three values of the axial charge radius, r2A 0.30, 0.46, 0.62 fm2. This allows us to understand the importance of this last source of theoretical uncertainty. The three values are chosen to span the range of values proposed in Ref. [34], being the lower limit, central value, and upper limit for r2A. We also verified that \u0393D(1S0) has a linear dependence on r2A. As a consequence, performing the calculation for the three mentioned values of r2A is essentially equivalent to the \u201cstandard\u201d error propagation. Again, we define the theoretical uncertainty \u0394\u0393D(1S0)[r2A] arising from this last source as the half-range of the results, i.e.,\n\u0394\u0393D 1S0( ) r2A[ ] \u2261 maxpot |\u0393D 1S0( )r2A 0.30 \u2212 \u0393D 1S0( )r2A 0.62|2\u23a7\u23a8\u23a9 \u23ab\u23ac\u23ad, (76) where maxpot indicates that we take the maximum value among the different interactions considered. From the table, we can conclude that \u0394\u0393D(1S0)[r2A] 2.9 s\u22121, which is found to be essentially model-independent.\nIn conclusion, our final result for \u0393D(1S0) is \u0393D 1S0( ) 255.8 0.6( ) 4.4( ) 2.9( ) s\u22121, (77)\nwhere the three uncertainties arise from model dependence, chiral convergence, and the experimental error in the axial charge radius rA. The overall systematic uncertainty becomes 5.0 s\u22121 when the various contributions are summed. The uncertainty on r2A is instead statistical and, therefore, must be treated separately. This result can be compared with those of Refs. [10, 12]. In Ref. [10], we found a value of 253.5 (1.2) s\u22121, the error taking care of the cutoff dependence and the uncertainty in the dR LEC fitting procedure. When only the cutoff dependence is considered, it reduces to 0.2 s\u22121, somewhat smaller than the present 0.6 s\u22121. The central values that we obtained and the one quoted in Ref. [10], even if the chiral potentials are very different, are instead in reasonable agreement. In Ref. [12], it was found that \u0393D(1S0) 252.8(4.6)(3.9) s\u22121, where the first error is due to the truncation in the chiral expansion and the second is due to the uncertainty in the nucleon axial radius rA. These two errors should be compared with our 5.0 s\u22121 and 2.9 s\u22121. The agreement for the first error is very nice, while the small difference in the second error is certainly due to the fact that in Ref. [12] a larger uncertainty for r2A was used (0.22 fm2 vs. the present 0.16 fm2). Also, in this case, the agreement between the central values is good, even if the\npotential models adopted are very different. This could suggest that the observable \u0393D(1S0) is not sensitive to the nuclear potential model, as long as this can properly reproduce the deuteron and the nn scattering systems (as, in fact, any realistic modern potential usually does)."

            "text": "We investigated, for the first time, with local nuclear potential models derived in \u03c7EFT and consistent currents, the muon capture on deuteron, in the 1S0 initial nn scattering state. The use of this framework allowed us to 1) provide a new estimate for the capture rate \u0393D(1S0), which turned out to agree with the results already present in the literature and obtained still in \u03c7EFT, but with different (non-local) potential models [10, 12]; 2) accompany this estimate with a determination of the theoretical uncertainty, which arises from model dependence, chiral convergence, and the uncertainty in the single-nucleon axial charge radius rA. We also verified that the uncertainty arising from the numerical technique adopted to solve the two-body boundand scattering-state problem is completely negligible.\nOur final result is \u0393D(1S0) 255.8(0.6)(4.4)(2.9) s\u22121, where the three errors come from the three sources of uncertainty just mentioned. To provide an indicative value for the overall uncertainty, we propose to sum the systematic uncertainties arising from sources 1) and 2), obtaining the value of 5.0 s\u22121. Then, this error can be summed in quadrature with the one of source 3), 2.9 s\u22121. Therefore, we obtain \u0393D(1S0) 255.8(5.8) s\u22121. We remark again that the value of 5.8 s\u22121 for the overall uncertainty is only indicative, and the preferable procedure should be to treat the three errors, 0.6 s\u22121, 4.4 s\u22121, and 2.9 s\u22121, separately. Moreover, it is important to remind that the errors coming from the sources 1) and 2) can be considered only as lower limits of the actual uncertainty coming from the model dependence and the chiral truncation.\nGiven the success of this calculation in determining \u0393D(1S0) and its uncertainty, with a procedure less involved than the one of Ref. [12], which still leads to similar results, we plan to proceed with applying this framework to the calculation of \u0393D, retaining all the nn partial waves up to J = 2 and L = 3. These are known to provide contributions to \u0393D up to 1 s\u22121 [9]. In parallel, we plan to study the muon capture processes also on 3He and 6Li, in the footsteps of Ref. [27]. Here, the Norfolk potentials were used in conjunction with the variational and Green\u2019s function Monte Carlo techniques to solve for the A = 3, 6 bound states, and the final results were found to disagree, to some level, with the experimental data. It will be interesting to verify these outcomes, using the hyperspherical harmonics method to solve for the A = 3, 6 nuclei [47\u201349]. Last but not least, we plan to apply this same\nFrontiers in Physics frontiersin.org13\nframework to weak processes of interest for solar standard models and solar neutrino fluxes, i.e., the proton weak capture on proton (reaction 2), and on 3He (the so-called hep reaction). In this second case, it is remarkable that a consistent \u03c7EFT calculation is still missing (see Refs. [50\u201352]). For both reactions, we will be able to provide a value for the astrophysical S-factor at zero energy accompanied by an estimate of the theoretical uncertainty."
