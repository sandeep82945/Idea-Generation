Neutron diffraction experiments on single-crystal samples uncover a remarkable anticollinear magnetic order below TN = 170 K characterized by a N\u00e9el arrangement of the spins within each layer and an orthogonal arrangement between adjacent layers. To understand the origin of this unusual magnetic structure, we analyze the spin-wave excitation spectrum by means of inelastic neutron scattering and bulk measurements. A spectral gap of 0.5 meV, along with a spinflop transition at 3.2 T, reflect the energy scale associated with the degeneracy-lifting. A minimal model to explain these observations requires both a positive biquadratic interlayer exchange and dipolar interactions, both of which are on the order of 10\u22124 meV, only a few parts per million of the dominant exchange interaction J1 \u2248 11 meV. These results provide direct evidence for the selection of a non-collinear magnetic structure by the combined effect of two distinct degeneracy lifting interactions.\nIntroduction. The emergence of accidental ground state degeneracy and its lifting are central to our understanding of frustrated magnetism [1\u20133]. The interplay between exchange interactions and lattice geometry often result in a family of accidentally degenerate ground states that are unrelated by symmetry. The degeneracy is then lifted either by subleading interactions, e.g. magnetic dipolar interaction [4\u20137], magnetoelastic coupling [8, 9], etc.; or by fluctuations that normally work against ordering, e.g. quenched disorder, thermal or quantum fluctuations, through the \u201corder by disorder (ObD)\" mechanism [10\u201316]. The diverse degeneracy lifting mechanisms can stabilize a host of magnetic orders in materials with similar structures and chemical compositions [17, 18], and their competition offers flexible tunablity in and out-ofequilibrium [19, 20]. Yet, experimentally revealing the degeneracy lifting mechanism is a challenging task due to the minuscule energy scales, sometimes in the one part per million of the dominant exchange interaction, associated with these subleading interactions and/or the ObD effects [21].\nThe quasi two-dimensional (2D) square lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet with AB stacking is a prominent model system to illustrate the diverse degeneracy lifting mechanisms and the wealth of resulting magnetic orders [14, 28\u201330]. The antiferromagnetic intra-layer exchange interaction stablize a 2D N\u00e9el order in each layer. However, the inter-layer exchange interactions are frustrated owing to the AB stacking.\n* Present Adress: Neutron Scattering Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN 37831, USA \u2020 yuan.wan@iphy.ac.cn \u2021 dun@iphy.ac.cn\nConsequently, the N\u00e9el vectors in two adjacent layers remain decoupled at the mean field level, thereby giving rise\nar X\niv :2\n20 3.\n09 04\n9v 1\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .s\ntr -e\nl] 1\n7 M\nar 2\n02 2\n2 to a continuous manifold of accidentally degenerate ground states, which can then be selected by various mechanisms. In particular, the thermal and quantum fluctuations stabilize the collinear arrangement of N\u00e9el vectors through the ObD mechanism, whereas the quenched disorder favors anticollinear orders where the N\u00e9el vectors are orthogonal [14].\nExperimentally, such interlayer frustration exists in a large family of transition metal oxides with a layered perovskite structure of the K2NiF4 type [space group I4/mmm, Fig. 2(a)] and easy-plane single-ion anisotropy. Focusing on simple systems without secondary magnetic lattices or electron/hole doping, including La2MO4 (M = Cu [22], Ni [26, 31], Co [25, 27, 32]), LaSrFeO4 [24] and Sr2CuO2Cl2 [23], all of these compounds exhibit collinear orders without exception [Fig. 1(b)(c)]. In La2MO4 (M = Cu, Ni, Co), the orthorhombic lattice distortion lifts the degeneracy and stabilizes the collinear order [25, 26, 33]. In LaSrFeO4 and Sr2CuO2Cl2, the lattice distortion is absent; the degeneracy lifting mechanism is less clear though thermal or quantum fluctuations are likely responsible [14, 30].\nIn this work, we investigate a much less characterized member of this material family, LaSrCrO4 (LSCrO) [34\u201336]. Using neutron scattering measurements on a single crystal sample, we reveal a striking anticollinear magnetic ground state [Fig. 1(d)] that is distinct from all the compounds mentioned above. Combining theoretical analysis with various experimental measurements, we show that the magnetic dipolar interaction and the biquadratic spin exchange interaction, both on the order of 10\u22125 (10 ppm) of the main exchange interaction J1, are responsible for lifting the degeneracy and stabilizing the anticollinear state in this material. Our results thus establish LSCrO as a rare example where the degeneracy lifting interactions with minuscule energy scales can be exposed unambiguously.\nAnticollinear order. We grow for the first time centimetersized single crystals of LSCrO via the floating zone technique [39]. X-ray and neutron diffraction measurements confirm that it crystallizes in the tetragonal space group I4/mmm at room temperature with lattice constants a = b = 3.87218(3) \u00c5, c = 12.516(1) \u00c5 [Fig. 2(a)], consistent with previous reports [34, 36]. By using Rietveld refinement of the nuclear Bragg peaks measured at various temperatures, we found no structural phase transitions down to 4 K. Similar to other quasi-2D system [40], the magnetic ordering in LSCrO occurs in two steps. At temperatures below 350 K, short-ranged 2D N\u00e9el order develops gradually, evidenced by the increasing magnetic scattering intensities at the M -point of the square lattice Brillouin zone, which are diffuse along the L direction [Fig. 2(b) and (d)].\nBelow TN = 170 K, the diffuse scattering quickly concentrates into sharp magnetic Bragg peaks at wave vectors Q = (H + 12 ,K + 1 2 , L) in reciprocal space [Fig. 2(b)], pinpointing a three-dimensional (3D) ordering of Cr3+ spins. Interestingly, magnetic Bragg peaks are observed at Q with both even and odd L [Fig. 2(b)(c)]. This observation can not be explained by the 3D N\u00e9el order with a single ordering wave vector, where the magnetic structure factor would be extinct at either even or odd L [41]. In other words, the spins in adjacent\n(a) (b)\n3 \u0393 X\nYM\nEi = 120 meV, T = 5 K (a)\n(b) (c) (d)\nFIG. 3.

We attribute this gap to the weak, easy-plane single-ion anisotropy of the Cr3+ moments.\nGiven the large spin carried by the Cr3+ ions [electron configuration t32g , S = 3/2], we expect that the observed spectrum can be understood in terms of the linear spin wave theory (LSWT). We find that the following minimal model Hamiltonian, which includes the first (J1) and the second neighbor (J2) exchange interactions, as well as an easy-plane singleion anisotropy (A), can well describe the in-plane dispersion of the spin wave within the LSWT framework:\nH0 = J1 \u2211 \u3008ij\u30091 Si \u00b7 Sj + J2 \u2211 \u3008ij\u30092 Si \u00b7 Sj +A \u2211 i (Szi ) 2, (1)\nwhere the summation \u3008ij\u3009n runs over n-th neighbor spin pairs. We attain the best fit [dashed black lines in Fig. 3(a)(b)] with J1 = 10.6(1) meV, J2 = 0.16(6) meV, A = 0.05(1) meV. The energy scale of the J1 exchange is comparable to the onset temperature for the short-ranged 2D N\u00e9el order.\nFinally, we examine the low energy dispersion along the L direction at the M -point with the best energy resolution obtained at Ei = 8 meV [Fig. 3(c)]. Remarkably, the spectrum is gaped throughout. As the gaps do not show discernible L-dependence, we conclude that the interlayer couplings be-\ntween Cr3+ spins of adjacent layers are smaller than the instrument resolution [> 0.1 meV]. By integrating L in Fig. 3(c) and avoiding regions where there is inelastic leakage from magnetic Bragg peaks, we obtain the energy dependence of dynamic susceptibility \u03c7\u2032\u2032(Q, \u03c9), which clearly reveals a second, much smaller gap \u2206 \u2248 0.5(1) meV [Fig. 3(d)].\nThe weak interlayer coupling is expected given the relative low 3D ordering temperature, kBTN/[J1S(S + 1)] = 0.391. As a crude estimate, we neglect the small easy-plane anisotropy and utilize the published ordering temperatures of the quasi-2D Heisenberg model as determined by quantum Monte Carlo simulations [45, 46]. We estimate the interlayer coupling is in the range of 10\u22126 meV to 10\u22123 meV [39].\nInterlayer couplings. While the minimal model Eq. (1) can produce the in-plane dispersion of the spin wave, it is silent on the origin of the 3D magnetic structure. We now discuss the interlayer couplings that can stabilize the anticollinear state of LSCrO.\nTo set the stage, we determine the symmetry-allowed couplings between the N\u00e9el vectors associated with the two sublattices. The single ion anisotropy forces the N\u00e9el vectors to lie in the plane. We parametrize the orientation of the N\u00e9el vector in the sublattice A/B by the azimuthal angle \u03c6a/\u03c6b, respectively [Fig. 1(a)]. The interaction energy can be expanded as Fourier series of \u03c6a,b. Up to the 4th order harmonics, our symmetry analysis yields three algebraically independent coupling terms [39]: \u2212 sin(\u03c6a + \u03c6b),\u2212 cos(4\u03c6a)\u2212cos(4\u03c6b), and cos(2\u03c6a \u2212 2\u03c6b). The signs at the front are needed to energetically favor the anticollinear state, i.e. \u03c6a = 0, \u03c6b = \u03c0/2 (and symmetry-related configurations). Each term admits a physical interpretation: The first term arises from the magnetic (pseudo) dipolar interaction; the second describes an in-plane, four-fold symmetric single ion anisotropy; the last comes from the biquadratic exchange interaction.\nStabilizing the anticollinear order found in LSCrO requires the combination of either (a) dipolar interaction and biquadratic exchange or (b) dipolar interaction and single-ion anisotropy. Note the combination of the biquadratic exchange and the single-ion anisotropy does not fully lift the accidental degeneracy \u2014 it admits another, symmetry-inequivalent anticollinear state \u03c6a = 0, \u03c6b = \u2212\u03c0/2 [Fig. 1(e)] in addition to the state observed in LSCrO.\nAmong the two possible combinations, we find the first can produce the correct spin flop transition observed in LSCrO (see below). We thus arrive at the following minimal Hamiltonian for the interlayer coupling:\nH\u2032 = \u2211 \u3008ij\u30093 D(Si \u00b7 Sj \u2212 3(Si \u00b7 n\u0302ij)(Sj \u00b7 n\u0302ij))\n+K(Si \u00b7 Sj)2, (2)\nwhere the summation is over all third-neighbor pairs. n\u0302ij is the unit vector pointing from site i to site j. D > 0 and K > 0 are strength of the dipolar and biqudratic couplings, respectively.\nSpin flop transitions. We now turn to the experimental test of the model Eq. (2).

The Zeeman coupling favors the N\u00e9el vectors to be perpendicular to the field in each layer. When the field is sufficiently strong, this effect can overcome the dipolar/biquadratic interactions and stabilize a collinear state. The resulting evolution from an anticollinear to a collinear magnetic structure thus offers a probe of the nature and strength of the interlayer couplings.\nOur theoretical analysis based on the model Eq. (2) reveals distinct magnetization processes when field is aligned along different high symmetry directions. Within increasing field \u2016 [110], we find the angle between the N\u00e9el vectors of the two sublattices gradually increase from \u03c0/2 to \u03c0, at which point the system enters the collinear state. Meanwhile, the N\u00e9el vectors remain symmetric with respect to the field [Fig. 4(a)]. The onset field of the collinear state is given by g\u00b5B\u00b50Hc = 16 \u221a J1KS4. Note this process is a crossover as opposed to a phase transition in that no symmetry is spontaneously broken. By contrast, with the field \u2016 [100], the N\u00e9el vectors are initially pinned to the anticollinear state [Fig. 4(b)]. A spin flop transition occurs at Hc1, at which point the N\u00e9el vectors are no longer orthogonal and evolve toward the collinear state, whereby spontaneously breaking the \u03c0-rotation symme-\ntry with respect to [100]. The system enters the collinear state at Hc2 although the collinear N\u00e9el vectors are not strictly orthogonal to the field. No symmetry breaking occurs at Hc2 and thus it constitutes a crossover. With increasing field, the collinear N\u00e9el vectors continuously approach the limit where they are orthogonal to the field. Hc1,c2 are determined by:\n(g\u00b5B\u00b50Hc1) 2 32J1 = \u221a KD, (3a)\n(g\u00b5B\u00b50Hc2) 2\n32J1 = \u221a K2 2 + K 2 \u221a K2 + 4D2, (3b)\nwhere K = 8KS4 and D = 12a2DS2/(2a2 + c2). These predictions are confirmed experimentally by our dc magnetization measurements. The differential magnetization in [110] direction shows a maximum near 5 T, corresponding to the crossover from non-collinear to collinear states at Hc [Fig. 4(c)]. By contrast, in the field \u2016 [100], we observe inflection points at 3.15(5) T and 5 T [Fig. 4(d)]. We identify the inflection near 3 T as the spin flop transition at Hc1 and the one near 5 T as the crossover at Hc2. This interpretation is further supported by ultrasound velocity measurements [Fig. 4(f)]. When the field is applied in the [100] direction, the relative speed of transverse sound wave shows a clear minimum at 3.27 T, indicative of a phase transition, but no anomaly is found at 5 T. Meanwhile, neutron diffraction measurement with field \u2016 [110] reveals a gradual increase (decrease) of magnetic Bragg peak intensities with even (odd) L values up to the highest measured magnetic field of 4 T [Fig. 4(e)], consistent with the picture of a gradual rotation of N\u00e9el vectors [Fig. 4(a)].\nUsing the experimentally measured value of Hc1 and Hc2 in the [100] direction, we estimate DS2 \u2248 1.4 \u00d7 10\u22124 meV and KS4 \u2248 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22124 meV. Using these parameters, we determine the crossover field \u00b50Hc \u2248 5 T in the [110] direction, in agreement with the experiment. Meanwhile, the LSWT predicts all four branches of the spin waves are gapped. The interlayer interactions open two gaps with values 0.2 meV and 0.6 meV. The 0.6 meV gap is consistent with the observed spectral gap \u2206[Fig. 3(d)], whereas the 0.2 meV gap is beyond the energy resolution of our measurements.\nWe note that the alternative model for interlayer coupling, namely the dipolar coupling and the four-fold symmetric single-ion anisotropy, produces first-order spin flop transitions in the [100] directions [39], which is inconsistent with the experiment.\nDiscussion. Having established the nature and strength of interlayer interactions [Eq. (2)], we now discuss their microscopic origins. The dipolar coupling D may originate from either the pseudo-dipolar coupling, commonly found in systems with strong spin-orbital coupling, or the magnetic dipolar interaction. Given the filled t2g shell of Cr3+, we do not expect significant spin-orbital coupling and thus rules out the former possibility. Note that our case is very different from isostructural compounds with a second, magnetic rare earth sublattice, e.g. R2CuO4 (R = Ce, Pr, Nd) [41, 48\u201350], which could mediate the pseudo-dipolar coupling [51]. Instead, we findD is naturally attributed to the magnetic dipolar coupling.\n5 Our magnetostatic calculation yields DS2 \u2248 2 \u00d7 10\u22124 meV based on refined moment of 2.25\u00b5B/Cr3+, consistent with the estimate based on the spin flop field. Dipolar coupling is known to be crucial for rare-earth magnets with ice-like frustration [52\u201354] where the exchange interactions are small. Our work demonstrates that it can also play an important role in systems with comparatively much stronger exchange coupling.\nThe positive biquadratic exchange interaction could be generated either by higher order virtual hopping processes in the superexchange [55], or more likely by quenched disorder due to the La/Sr mixing through the ObD mechanism [14, 16]. We also note that the combination of dipolar interaction and a negative biquadratic exchange, produced by the thermal or quantum ObD, would stabilize a collinear order with the spins in the [110] direction, which may explain the 3D ordering in Sr2CuO2Cl2 or LaSrFeO4. This observation motivates further investigation of quenched disorder to control magnetic order in frustrated magnets or spintronic devices.\nThe experimental observation of the anticollinear order in LSCrO uncovers a new territory in the phase diagram of the AB-stacked square-lattice antiferromagnet. In contrast to the collinear magnetic states displayed by all related materials, the anticollinear order in LSCrO exhibits a rich and unique magnetic field evolution stemming from interlayer effects that\nare merely a few parts-per-million of the main exchange interaction. A systematic study of the temperature-field phase diagram of LSCrO and its materials relatives is poised to reveal more surprises in this canonical family of geometrically frustrated magnets.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Cristian Batista and Hitesh Changlani for helpful discussions.

In order to grow the single crystals, powder sample was first synthesized from a stoichiometric mixture of La2O3 (baked before usage), SrCO3, and Cr2O3 under flowing 10%H2/Ar atmosphere at 1350 \u25e6C for 40h with several intermediate re-grindings. The synthesized powder was pressed into cylindrical rods (of approximately 6 mm in diameter and 70\u201380 mm in length) and then melted at higher temperatures in a two-mirror optical floating zone furnace (NEC, Conan Inc., equipped with two 1500W halogen lamps) under 1 atmosphere gas of 4%H2/Ar. The best crystal was obtained using a growth voltage of 92 V and a pulling rate of 35 mm/h. Slight evaporation of melted mixture was observed during growth. The obtained single crystal was black in color and naturally cleaves into shining surfaces that are perpendicular to the crystallographic c-axis [Fig. S1 left], reflecting the quasi-2D nature of the layered perovskite structure. The crystals were oriented by Laue back diffraction for subsequently measurements [Fig. S1 right].\nB. Magnetic measurements\nMagnetic susceptibility measurements were made using a Quantum Design Magnetic Properties Measurement System with a superconducting interference device (SQUID) magnetometer. Measurements were made after cooling in zero field of \u00b50H= 1 T over the temperature range 2 K to 300 K [Fig. S2 left]. A weak slope change was observed at the N\u00e9el temperature of 170 K. Isothermal magnetization M(H) measurements were made using the same SQUID at temperatures of 2 K and 200 K between 0 and 6.5 T [Fig. S2 right].\n8 FIG. S1.

Right: magnetization curves measured at 2 K and 200 K with field applied along three high-symmetry directions.\nC. Neutron-scattering measurements\nSingle crystal neutron diffraction measurements were carried out using the Four-Circle Diffractometer (HB3A) [38] at the High Flux Isotope Reactor, and diffuse scattering measurements using the Elastic Diffuse Scattering Spectrometer (CORELLI) [47] at the Spallation Neutron Source, both located at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. For the HB3A measurements, a small single crystal was cooled down to a base temperature of 4 K, and measured using a constant neutron wavelength of \u03bb = 1.003 \u00c5. For the CORELLI measurements, a single crystal was oriented in the (HHL) scattering plane and cooled down to 2 K using a orange cryostat inside a 5 T superconducting magnet.\nInelastic neutron scattering measurements were carried out using the Fine-Resolution Fermi Chopper Spectrometer (SEQUOIA) [37] at the Spallation Neutron Source, Oak Ridge National Laboratory. A single crystal \u223c3 g (size: 4 mm\u00d740 mm\u00d76 mm) [Fig. S1 left] was oriented in the (HHL) scattering plane cooled down to 5 K with a closed-cycle refrigerator. Magnon excitations were mapped out with incident neutron energies of 120, 20, and 8 meV with sample rotation of 2\u25e6/step. Constant energy cut of the 120 meV dataset in the [HK0] scattering plane was summarized in Fig. S5. The data was integrated along L direction and symmetrized according to the point group symmetry of the Cr site, resulting in the dispersion curve shown in the main text.\nSpace group: I4/mmm.

Refinements of nuclear and magnetic structures\nRietveld refinements of the nuclear and magnetic structures are done using the 4 K neutron diffraction data measured at HB3a. Nuclear reflections are collected for Bragg peaks at wave-vectors Q = (H,K,L), and magnetic reflections are collected at Q = (H + 1/2,K + 1/2, L+ 1/2), where H,K,L are integer numbers.\nCrystal structural refinement was carried out using the FULLPROF suite of programs. The observed nuclear Bragg peaks intensities agrees well with layered perovskite structure of the I4/mmm space group. Refined crystallographic parameters are given in TABLE I.\nMagnetic structural analysis was carried out using the Bilbao Crystallographic Server [42] using two propagation vectors, k1 = (0.5, 0.5, 0) and k2 = (0.5,\u22120.5, 0). The maximal magnetic space groups for I4/mmm space group and the two propagation vectors are PC42/ncm, PC42/mbm, and PC42/nbm. PC42/ncm corresponds to the observed spin order in LaSrCrO4. PC42/mbm corresponds a different anticollinear state, i.e., \u03c6a = 0, \u03c6b = \u2212\u03c0/2 shown in Fig.1(e) of the main text. PC42/nbm describe a N\u00e9el order with easy axis anisotropy, i.e. N\u00e9el order vectors are pointing along crystallographic c-axis.\nE. Ultrasonic measurement\nAll measurements have been obtained using a single crystal with parallel faces normal to the crystallographic a-axis. 30 MHz LiNbO3 transducers were mounted on those faces in order to realized sound velocity measurements in the transmission configuration. A sample of 4.08 mm in length, along the direction of propagation (x \u2016 a-axis), was necessary in order to determine the velocity of longitudinal modes VLx and transverse modes with a polarization along (y \u2016 b-axis), VTxPy. The data, realized at 90 MHz using a pulsed acoustic interferometer, were used to explore the spin flop transitions of LaSrCrO4 with the\n10\n0.4 0.6 [H,H,0] (r.l.u.)\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0 1.5 [0 ,0 ,L ] ( r.l .u .)\nCut E=[0.20,0.60] meV\n0.4 0.6 [H,H,0] (r.l.u.)\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n[0 ,0\n,L ] (\nr.l .u\n.)\nCut E=[0.80,1.20] meV\n0.4 0.6 [H,H,0] (r.l.u.)\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n[0 ,0\n,L ] (\nr.l .u\n.)\nCut E=[1.80,2.20] meV\n0.0000\n0.0005\n0.0010\n0.0015\n0.0020\n0.0025\n0.0030\nIn te\nns ity In te ns ity In te ns ity\nFIG.

ESTIMATE THE ENERGY SCALE OF INTERLAYER COUPLING\nThe 3D N\u00e9el ordering temperature is relatively small compared to the intralayer exchange interaction in LaSrCrO4, i.e., kBTN/[J1S(S + 1)] = 0.391. The N\u00e9el temperature of a quasi-two-dimensional spin-S Heisenberg antiferromagnet is given by [45, 46]:\nkBTN J1S(S + 1) = 4\u03c0\u03c1s b\u2212 ln (J \u2032/J1) , (S4)\nwhere \u03c1s is the spin stiffness, b is a dimensionless constant, and J \u2032 is the interlayer coupling. As \u03c1s and b are unknown for S = 3/2, we utilize the published N\u00e9el temperature data for S = 1 and S = \u221e [46], obtained by quantum and classical Monte Carlo simulations, respectively to constrain the value of J \u2032/J . Fitting the TN data for S = 1 to Eq. (S4) yields \u03c1s = 0.68/S/(S + 1) = 0.34 and b = 3.12. Using the value of kBTN/[J1S(S + 1)] for LaSrCrO4 and solving for J \u2032, we obtain J \u2032/J1 = 4.1\u00d7 10\u22124. On the other hand, fitting the TN data for S =\u221e yields \u03c1s = 0.84 and b = 10.9, from which we estimate J/J1 = 1.1 \u00d7 10\u22127 in LaSrCrO4. These two estimates could be viewed as the upper and lower bounds on J \u2032/J in LaSrCrO4. As J \u223c 10 meV in LaSrCrO4, we deduce that the order of magnitude of the interlayer coupling is between 10\u22123 meV and 10\u22126 meV, presumably closer to the upper limit.\nIII. SYMMETRY ANALYSIS FOR INTERLAYER COUPLING\nThe magnetic order of LaSrCrO4 comprises of two sublattices, each hosting a three-dimensional N\u00e9el order. In this section, we perform the symmetry analysis on the coupling between the two N\u00e9el vectors .\nLet \u03c6a (\u03c6b) be the azimuthal angle of the N\u00e9el vector of the A (B) sublattice. For the A sublattice (crystallographic site label (i, j, k)), we define \u03c6a to be the angle between the spin on site (0, 0, 0) and the crystallographic a axis. For the B sublattice (crystallographic site label (i + 12 , j + 1 2 , k + 1 2 )), we define \u03c6b to be the angle between the spin on site ( 1 2 , 1 2 , 1 2 ) and the crystallographic a axis. Generically, the coupling between the two Neel vectors can be expanded as Fourier series:\nE(\u03c6a, \u03c6b) = \u2211 m,n Cm,n cos(m\u03c6a + n\u03c6b) + Sm,n sin(m\u03c6a + n\u03c6b), (S5)\n11\nFIG. S5. Constant energy slices through the inelastic scattering in the (HK0) scattering plane at different neutron energy transfer measured on SEQUOIA at T = 5 K. Data was measured with neutron incident energy of 120 meV and integrated along L direction within L = [-5, 5] reciprocal lattice unit (r.l.u.)\nwhere m,n run over all integers. Cm,n and Sm,n are real coefficients. We use symmetry to constrains the possible form of E(\u03c6a, \u03c6b). To this end, we use the fact that the space group I4/mmm is symmorphic; it is therefore sufficient to consider the operations of the point group D4h. The point group D4h is generated a 4-fold rotation with respect to the crystallographic c axis (C4), a mirror operation whose norm is along the crystallographic a axis (m), and an spatial inversion i. Without loss of generality, we take the 4-fold axis and the mirror plane pass through an A site. We find:\n(\u03c6a, \u03c6b) C4\u2192 (\u03c6a +\n\u03c0 2 , \u03c6b \u2212 \u03c0 2 ); (\u03c6a, \u03c6b) m\u2192 (\u2212\u03c6a, \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c6b). (S6)\nMeanwhile, under the time reversal operation:\n(\u03c6a, \u03c6b) T\u2192 (\u03c6a + \u03c0, \u03c6b + \u03c0). (S7)\nFinally, the inversion exchanges \u03c6a and \u03c6b. As a result, the interaction must be symmetric with respect to \u03c6a,b:\nE(\u03c6a, \u03c6b) = E(\u03c6b, \u03c6a). (S8)\nThese symmetries are sufficient to constrain the interactions; adding more symmetries do not yield more independent constrains.\n12\nThe exchange symmetry between A and B sublattices constrains the harmonics must come in pairs:\ncos(m\u03c6a + n\u03c6b) + cos(n\u03c6a +m\u03c6b), sin(m\u03c6a + n\u03c6b) + sin(n\u03c6a +m\u03c6b). (S9)\nUnder the mirror operation, these terms become:\n(\u2212)n cos(m\u03c6a + n\u03c6b) + (\u2212)m cos(n\u03c6a +m\u03c6b), (\u2212)n+1 sin(m\u03c6a + n\u03c6b) + (\u2212)m+1 sin(n\u03c6a +m\u03c6b). (S10)\nThese conditions require that, for the cos harmonics, both m and n must be even; whereas, for the sin harmonics, both m and n must be odd. These conditions automatically enforce the time reversal symmetry.\nThe remaining task is to enforce the C4 symmetry. Note the symmetry operations cannot mix harmonics of different orders (m,n). Meanwhile, the parity of (m,n) are distinct for the cos terms and sin terms. It follows that cos terms and sin terms cannot mix under symmetry operations. Said differently, the cos terms must transform to itself, and so do the sin terms. On the other hand, under the action of C4:\ncos(m\u03c6a + n\u03c6b) + cos(n\u03c6a +m\u03c6b)\u2192 (\u22121) m\u2212n 2 [cos(m\u03c6a + n\u03c6b) + cos(n\u03c6a +m\u03c6b)],\nsin(m\u03c6a + n\u03c6b) + sin(n\u03c6a +m\u03c6b)\u2192 (\u22121) m\u2212n 2 [sin(m\u03c6a + n\u03c6b) + sin(n\u03c6a +m\u03c6b)]. (S11)\nHere, we have used the fact that m\u2212 n is always an even number (and hence (m\u2212 n)/2 is an integer). The invariance requires that m\u2212 n must be multiples of 4.\nWe are now ready to write down all the symmetry allowed interactions by their order of harmonics p = |m|+ |n|. Terms with odd p are forbidden by symmetry. At p = 2, there is only 1 linearly independent, symmetry allowed term:\nsin(\u03c6a + \u03c6b). (S12)\nThis term can be generated by the magnetic dipole coupling or the pseudo-dipolar coupling between the two sublattices. At p = 4, there are 3 linearly independent, symmetry allowed terms:\ncos(4\u03c6a) + cos(4\u03c6b), cos(2\u03c6a \u2212 2\u03c6b), sin(3\u03c6a \u2212 \u03c6b) + sin(3\u03c6a \u2212 \u03c6b), cos(2\u03c6a + 2\u03c6b). (S13)\nThe first term can be generated by an in-plane single-spin crystalline anisotropic term. The second term can be interpreted as the biquadratic exchange interaction. The third term does not have any obvious microscopic interpretations; however, it can be viewed as a product of the p = 1 term with the cos(4\u03c6a) + cos(4\u03c6b) term. Likewise, the last term can be viewed as the square of the p = 1 term. Thus, the last two terms are not algebraically independent.\nKeeping algebraically independent terms up to p = 4, we arrive at the two minimal models for the interlayer coupling. The first model, which we dub the dipole-biqaudratic model, is given by:\nE(\u03c6a, \u03c6b) = S1,1 sin(\u03c6a + \u03c6b) + C2,\u22122 cos(2\u03c6a \u2212 2\u03c6b). (S14)\nStabilizing the anticollinear state in LaSrCrO4 require S1,1 < 0 and C2,\u22122 > 0. Minimizing the energy yields four symmetryrelated solutions: \u03c6a = 0, \u03c6b = \u03c0/2; \u03c6a = \u03c0, \u03c6b = \u2212\u03c0/2; \u03c6a = \u03c0/2, \u03c6b = 0; and \u03c6a = \u2212\u03c0/2, \u03c6b = \u03c0. Microscopically, the dipole-biquadratic model consists of both dipole and biquadratic exchange interaction between spins between the third neighbor pairs:\nH \u2032 = \u2211 \u3008ij\u30093 D(Si \u00b7 Sj \u2212 3(Si \u00b7 n\u0302ij)(Sj \u00b7 n\u0302ij)) +K(Si \u00b7 Sj)2. (S15)\nHere, the summation is over all third neighbor bonds. n\u0302ij is the unit vector pointing from site i to site j. D > 0 and K > 0 are model parameters.\nThe second model, which we dub the dipole-anisotropy model, is given by:\nE(\u03c6a, \u03c6b) = S1,1 sin(\u03c6a + \u03c6b) + C4,0(cos(4\u03c6a) + cos(4\u03c6b)). (S16)\nStabilizing the anticollinear state found in LaSrCrO4 require S1,1 < 0 and C4,0 < 0. Microscopically, this model consists of dipole interaction between spins on adjacent layers, and a single-ion anisotropy term:\nH \u2032 = \u2211 \u3008ij\u30093 D(Si \u00b7 Sj \u2212 3(Si \u00b7 n\u0302ij)(Sj \u00b7 n\u0302ij)) + A\u2032 2 \u2211 i ((Sxi ) 2(Syi ) 2 + (Syi ) 2(Sxi ) 2). (S17)\nHere, D > 0 and A\u2032 > 0 are model parameters.\n13\nIV. SPIN FLOP TRANSITIONS OF THE DIPOLE-BIQUADRATIC MODEL\nIn this section, we analyze the spin flop transitions of the dipole-biquadratic model. We determine analytically the critical field and the magnetization curve. These analytic results allow us to estimate the strength of the effective dipole coupling and the biquadratic coupling. In our calculations, we assume that the nearest neighbor Heisenberg exchange interaction J1 is significantly larger than the Zeeman energy as well as all the other spin interactions.\nA. Field along the [100] direction\nWe first consider the spin flop transitions when the field is applied along the [100] direction. In the absence of magnetic field, the spins belonging to the even layers (dubbed A sublattice) form a three-dimensional N\u00e9el order, whereas thee spins belonging to the odd layers (dubbed B sublattice) form another three-dimensional N\u00e9el order. Since the Zeeman energy is significantly weaker than the nearest neighbor exchange interaction, the N\u00e9el orders are only slightly distorted. Let the \u03c6a and \u03c6b be the azimuthal angle of the Neel vectors in the A and B sublattices, respectively. Here, \u03c6a (\u03c6b) is defined as the azimuthal angle of the spin on site (0, 0, 0) ((1/2, 1/2, 1/2)). The energy of these two subsystems in the presence of the magnetic field is given by:\nE N = \u2212 (g\u00b5BB)\n2\n32J1 (sin2 \u03c6a + sin 2 \u03c6b), (S18)\nwhere N is the total number of spins, g the Land\u00e9 g-factor, \u00b50 the Bohr magneton. This energy alone favors both N\u00e9el vectors to be orthogonal with the field; it must compete with the dipole/biquadratic coupling between the two subsystems,\nE\u2032 N = 4KS4 cos2(\u03c6a \u2212 \u03c6b)\u2212 12a2 2a2 + c2 DS2 sin(\u03c6a + \u03c6b). (S19)\nHere, a and c are the lattice constants. The magnetic ground state is determined by minimizing the total energy:\nEtot = E + E \u2032. (S20)\nIt is convenient to define a new pair of variables:\n\u03c6+ = \u03c6a + \u03c6b; \u03c6\u2212 = \u03c6a \u2212 \u03c6b. (S21) We rewrite the total energy as,\nEtot N = B cos\u03c6+ cos\u03c6\u2212 + K 2 cos2 \u03c6\u2212 \u2212D sin\u03c6+. (S22)\nHere, we have defined a set of parameters for the sake of brevity:\nB = (g\u00b5BB) 2 32J1 ; K = 8KS4; D = 12a 2 2a2 + c2 DS2. (S23)\nThe stationary condition is thus given by:\nsin\u03c6\u2212(B cos\u03c6+ +K cos\u03c6\u2212) = 0; B sin\u03c6+ cos\u03c6\u2212 +D cos\u03c6+ = 0. (S24) The Hessian matrix is given by:\nM =\n[ \u2212B cos\u03c6+ cos\u03c6\u2212 \u2212K cos 2\u03c6\u2212 B sin\u03c6+ sin\u03c6\u2212\nB sin\u03c6+ sin\u03c6\u2212 \u2212B cos\u03c6+ cos\u03c6\u2212 +D sin\u03c6+\n] . (S25)\nWe find three solutions to the stationary condition. They are:\n\u2022 Orthogonal state. This state is identical to the zero-field magnetic ground state. It is corresponds to:\n\u03c6+ = \u03c0\n2 ; \u03c6\u2212 = \u00b1\n\u03c0 2 . (S26)\nThe Hessian matrix reads:\nM = [ K \u00b1B \u00b1B D ] . (S27)\nThe stability of this state requires\nB2 \u2264 B2c1 = KD. (S28)\n14\n\u2022 Collinear state. In this state, the two N\u00e9el vectors are collinear. They correspond to the following two symmetry related solutions:\n\u03c6\u2212 = 0, \u03c6+ = \u03c0 \u2212 arcsin D\u221a B2 +D2 . (S29a)\nor\n\u03c6\u2212 = \u03c0, \u03c6+ = arcsin D\u221a B2 +D2 . (S29b)\nThe Hessian matrix reads:\nM =\n[ B2\u221a B2+D2 \u2212K 0\n0 B 2\n\u221a B2+D2\n] . (S30)\nThe stability of this state requires\nB2 > B2c2 = K2 2 (1 +\n\u221a 1 +\n4D2 K2 ). (S31)\n\u2022 Intermediate state. In this state, the N\u00e9el vectors are neither orthogonal nor collinear. It corresponds to the solutions:\n\u03c6+ = arcsin KD B2 , \u03c6\u2212 = \u00b1(\u03c0 \u2212 arccos ( B K \u221a 1\u2212 K 2D2 B4 ) ), (S32a)\nand\n\u03c6+ = \u2212 arcsin KD B2 , \u03c6\u2212 = \u00b1 arccos ( B K \u221a 1\u2212 K 2D2 B4 ) . (S32b)\nApparently, this state exists if and only if:\nB2c1 \u2264 B2 \u2264 B2c2. (S33)\nTo conclude, at low magnetic field (B < Bc1), the system is in the orthogonal state; at intermediate field (Bc2 < B < Bc1), the system is in the intermediate field; at high field (Bc2 < B), the system is in the collinear state.\nWe now compute the magnetization curve. The magnetization parallel (M\u2016) and orthogonal (M\u22a5) to the magnetic field is given by:\nM\u2016\nN =\n(g\u00b5B) 2B\n16J1 (1\u2212 cos\u03c6+ cos\u03c6\u2212);\nM\u22a5\nN = \u2212 (g\u00b5B)\n2B\n16J1 sin\u03c6+ cos\u03c6\u2212. (S34)\nUsing the previously obtained solutions for \u03c6\u00b1, we find:\nM\u2016\nN =\n(g\u00b5B) 2B\n16J1 \u00d7  1 (B \u2264 Bc1) 1 + BK \u2212 KD 2\nB3 (Bc1 \u2264 B \u2264 Bc2) 1 + B\u221aB2+D2 (Bc2 \u2264 B) ; (S35a)\nM\u22a5\nN =\n(g\u00b5B) 2B\n16J1 \u00d7  0 (B \u2264 Bc1) \u00b1DB \u221a\n1\u2212 K2D2B4 (Bc1 \u2264 B \u2264 Bc2) \u00b1 D\u221aB2+D2 (Bc2 \u2264 B)\n(S35b)\nIn the expression for M\u22a5, the plus and minus signs correspond to the two symmetry-related magnetic ground states.\n15\nB. Field along the [110] direction\nWhen the field is applied along the [110] direction, the total energy now reads:\nEtot N = B sin\u03c6+ cos\u03c6\u2212 + K 2 cos2 \u03c6\u2212 \u2212D sin\u03c6+. (S36)\nHere, the definition of \u03c6\u00b1, B, K, and D are the same as before. In comparison with the energy in [110] field, the energy due to the magnetic field (the first term) changes its form, whereas the other two terms stay the same. The stationary condition reads:\nsin\u03c6\u2212(B sin\u03c6+ +K cos\u03c6\u2212) = 0; cos\u03c6+(B cos\u03c6\u2212 \u2212D) = 0. (S37) The Hessian matrix reads:\nM =\n[ \u2212B sin\u03c6+ cos\u03c6\u2212 \u2212K cos 2\u03c6\u2212 \u2212B cos\u03c6+ sin\u03c6\u2212\n\u2212B cos\u03c6+ sin\u03c6\u2212 \u2212B sin\u03c6+ cos\u03c6\u2212 +D sin\u03c6+\n] . (S38)\nWe find three solutions to the stationary condition:\n\u2022 Noncollinear state. This state is characterized by:\n\u03c6+ = \u03c0\n2 ; \u03c6\u2212 = \u00b1(\u03c0 \u2212 arccos (B K ) ). (S39)\nThe Hessian matrix reads:\nM =\n[ K \u2212 B2K 0\n0 B 2 K +D\n] . (S40)\nThe stability of this state requires:\nB \u2264 Bc = K. (S41)\n\u2022 Collinear state. In this state, the two N\u00e9el vectors are collinear. It corresponds to the solution:\n\u03c6+ = \u03c0\n2 ; \u03c6\u2212 = \u03c0. (S42)\nThe Hessian matrix reads:\nM =\n[ B \u2212 K 0\n0 B +D\n] . (S43)\nThe stability requires:\nB \u2265 Bc = K. (S44)\n\u2022 Finally, there is an unstable solution:\nsin\u03c6+ = \u2212 KD B2 ; cos\u03c6\u2212 = D B . (S45)\nThe Hessian matrix is given by:\nM =\n[ K(1\u2212 D2B2 ) \u2217\n\u2217 0\n] . (S46)\nThe Hessian matrix is not positive semi-definite for all values of K,D,B. Therefore, this solution is unstable over the entire parameter space.\nTo conclude, at low field (B < Bc), the system is in a non-collinear state which is adiabatically connected to the zero-field state; at high field (B < Bc), the system enters the collinear state.\nWe now compute the magnetization curve. The magnetization parallel (M\u2016) and orthogonal (M\u22a5) to the magnetic field is given by:\nM\u2016\nN =\n(g\u00b5B) 2B\n16J1 (1\u2212 sin\u03c6+ cos\u03c6\u2212);\nM\u22a5\nN = \u2212 (g\u00b5B)\n2B\n16J1 cos\u03c6+ cos\u03c6\u2212. (S47)\nUsing the previously obtained solutions for \u03c6\u00b1, we find M\u22a5 = 0 over the entire field range, whereas M\u2016 is given by:\nM\u2016 = (g\u00b5B)\n2B 16J1 \u00d7 { 1 + BK (B \u2264 Bc) 2 (B \u2265 Bc) . (S48)\n16\nV. SPIN WAVE GAPS OF THE DIPOLE-BIQUADRATIC MODEL\nIn this section, we compute analytically the spin wave gaps of the dipole-biquadratic model. We shall see that the value of the gaps is directly related to the strength of the effective dipole and biquadratic interactions. In our calculation, we make the simplifying assumptions that the nearest neighbor Hesienberg exchange interaction J1 is significantly larger than all the other energy scales present in this system.\nThe Hamiltonian reads: H = \u2211 \u3008ij\u30091 J1Si \u00b7 Sj + \u2211 \u3008ij\u30093 D(Si \u00b7 Sj \u2212 3(Si \u00b7 n\u0302ij)(Sj \u00b7 n\u0302ij)) +K(Si \u00b7 Sj)2 +A \u2211 i (Szi ) 2. (S49)\nThe first summation over all the nearest neighbor bond describes the dominant intra-layer coupling. The second summation over all the third neighbor bonds describes the weak coupling between the adjacent layers. The last summation over all lattice sites describes the easy plane spin anisotropy. We have omitted J2 and J3 couplings as their contribution to the spin wave gap is second order.\nWe partition the lattice into four sublattices, which we dubbed as A1, A2. B1, and B2. The spin orientations are given by (in crystallographic axes):\nSA1 = S(1, 0, 0); SA2 = S(\u22121, 0, 0); SB1 = S(0, 1, 0); SB2 = S(0,\u22121, 0); (S50)\nAs the lowest energy spin wave excitations are all rigid rotations within the magnetic sublattices, we may set the spins in the same sublattice to take the same orientation. This reduces the Hamiltonian to the following:\nH = NJ1(SA1 \u00b7 SA2 + SB1 \u00b7 SB2) + \u2211\n\u03b1=A1,2 \u2211 \u03b2=B1,2 H\u03b1,\u03b2 + NA 4 \u2211 \u03b1=A1,2,B1,2 (Sz\u03b1) 2, (S51a)\nwhere\nH\u03b1,\u03b2 = NK(S\u03b1 \u00b7 S\u03b2)2 +ND [ S\u03b1 \u00b7 S\u03b2 \u2212 3c2\n2a2 + c2 Sc\u03b1S c \u03b2 \u2212\n3a2\n2a2 + c2 (Sa\u03b1 \u00b1 Sb\u03b1)(Sa\u03b2 \u00b1 Sb\u03b2)\n] . (S51b)\nHere, the plus (minus) sign is for the pair A1/B1 and A2/B2 (A1/B2 and A2/B1). N is the number of spins. In the next step, we choose the local spin frames such that the local Sz axis coincides with the spin direction in the magnetic ground state. We choose the crystallographic c axis as the local Sx axis. We further expand:\nSxi \u2248 \u221a Sui; S y i \u2248 \u221a Svi; S z i \u2248 S \u2212 u2i + v 2 i\n2 . (S52)\nSubstituting the above into the Hamiltonian, and expanding to the quadratic order, we obtain:\nH \u2248 N 2 uMuuu+ N 2 vMvvv, (S53)\nwhere the u and v are column vectors:\nu = uA1uA2uB1 uB2  , v = vA1vA2vB1 vB2  . (S54) The Hessian matrices read:\nMuu = S  J1 + A 2 + 2\u03b1D J1 \u22122\u03b2D \u22122\u03b2D J1 J1 + A 2 + 2\u03b1D \u22122\u03b2D \u22122\u03b2D\n\u22122\u03b2D \u22122\u03b2D J1 + A2 + 2\u03b1D J1 \u22122\u03b2D \u22122\u03b2D J1 J1 + A2 + 2\u03b1D\n ; (S55a)\nMvv = S J1 + 4KS 2 + 2\u03b1D \u2212J1 \u22122KS2 + \u03b1D \u22122KS2 + \u03b1D\n\u2212J1 J1 + 4KS2 + 2\u03b1D \u22122KS2 + \u03b1D \u22122KS2 + \u03b1D \u22122KS2 + \u03b1D \u22122KS2 + \u03b1D J1 + 4KS2 + 2\u03b1D \u2212J1 \u22122KS2 + \u03b1D \u22122KS2 + \u03b1D \u2212J1 J1S + 4KS2 + 2\u03b1D\n . (S55b)\n17\nHere, we have used short-hand notation:\n\u03b1 = 3a2 2a2 + c2 ; \u03b2 = 1\u2212 \u03b1 = c 2 \u2212 a2 2a2 + c2 . (S56)\nThe Lagrangian of the model reads:\nL = N\n4 uT v\u0307 \u2212H. (S57)\nThe equations of motion are thus:\nv\u0307 = \u22124Muuu; u\u0307 = 4Mvvv. (S58)\nThe spin wave frequencies \u03c9i are obtained by diagonalizing the dynamical matrix:\n16Spec(MuuMvv) = {\u03c92i }. (S59)\nWe are now ready to compute the spin wave frequencies. We note the following unitary transformation\nU = 1\n2 1 1 1 11 \u22121 1 \u221211 1 \u22121 \u22121 1 \u22121 \u22121 1  , (S60) simultaneously diagonalize the matrices Muu and Mvv:\nU\u2020MuuU = S  2J1 + A 2 + 2\u03b1D \u2212 4\u03b2D A 2 + 2\u03b1D\n2J1 + A 2 + 2\u03b1D + 4\u03b2D\nA 2 + 2\u03b1D\n ;\nU\u2020MvvU = S 4\u03b1D 2J1 + 4KS2 + 2\u03b1D 8KS2 2J1 + 4KS 2 + 2\u03b1D  . (S61) Thus, the spin wave frequencies are:\n\u03c91 = 4S \u221a (2J1 + A\n2 + 2\u03b1D \u2212 4\u03b2D)4\u03b1D \u2248 8S\n\u221a 2J1\u03b1D; (S62)\n\u03c92,4 = 4S \u221a (2J1 + 4KS2 + 2\u03b1D)( A\n2 + 2\u03b1D) \u2248 4S\n\u221a J1(A+ \u03b1D); (S63)\n\u03c93 = 4S \u221a (2J1 + A\n2 + 2\u03b1D + 4\u03b2D)8KS2 \u2248 16S2\n\u221a J1K; (S64)\nVI. MAGNETIC DIPOLE INTERACTION\nIn this section, we compute the magnetic dipole interaction energy between the two sublattices in LaSrCrO4. Similar to the previous sections, we partition the system into two sublattices, dubbed A and B. The A sublattice consists of the sites with crystallographic label (i, j, k), whereas the B sublattice consists of the sites with label (i+ 12 , j + 1 2 , k + 1 2 ).\nEach of the two sublattices hosts a three-dimensional N\u00e9el order with the N\u00e9el vector lying in the crystallographic ab plane. We parametrize the N\u00e9el vectors by the azimuthal angles \u03c6a and \u03c6b. Here, \u03c6a (\u03c6b) is defined as the azimuthal angle of the spin on site (0, 0, 0) ((1/2, 1/2, 1/2)).\nWe may write the magnetic dipole energy as:\nEdip = EAA + EAB + EBB . (S65)\n18\nwhere E00 and E11 are the intra-sublattice energy and E01 the inter-sub-lattice energy. The intra-sublattice energy E00 is given by:\nE00 = N\n4\n\u00b50m 2 4\u03c0a3 \u2211\u2032 ijk (\u22121)i+j [i2 + j2 + \u03b72k2]3/2 \u2212 3(\u22121) i+j(i cos\u03c6a + j sin\u03c6a) 2 [i2 + j2 + \u03b72k2]5/2\n= N\n4\n\u00b50m 2 4\u03c0a3 \u2211\u2032 ijk (\u22121)i+j [i2 + j2 + \u03b72k2]3/2 \u2212 3 2 (\u22121)i+j(i2 + j2) [i2 + j2 + \u03b72k2]5/2 . (S66)\nIn the first line, we have used the translation symmetry; in the second line, we have used the symmetry properties to simplify the sum: \u2211 ij = 0, \u2211 i2 = \u2211 j2. The factor of N/2 comes from the number of sites in sublattice A; another factor of 1/2 comes from double counting. \u03b7 \u2261 c/a characterizes the lattice geometry. We thus may write EAA as:\nEAA N = A 2\n\u00b50m 2 4\u03c0a3 , (S67)\nwhere the numeric constant:\nA = 1\n2 \u2211\u2032 ijk (\u22121)i+j\u2212 1 2 (i 2 + j2) + \u03b72k2 [i2 + j2 + \u03b72k2]5/2 . (S68)\nInversion symmetry immediate implies EBB = EAA. The remaining term is EAB :\nEAB = N\n2\n\u00b50m 2 4\u03c0a3 \u2211 ijk (\u22121)i+j cos(\u03c6a \u2212 \u03c6b) [(i\u2212 12 )2 + (j \u2212 12 )2 + \u03b72(k \u2212 12 )2]3/2\n\u2212 3(\u22121) i+j [(i\u2212 12 ) cos\u03c6a + (j \u2212 12 ) sin\u03c6a][(i\u2212 12 ) cos\u03c6b + (j \u2212 12 ) sin\u03c6b]\n[(i\u2212 12 )2 + (j \u2212 12 )2 + \u03b72(k \u2212 12 )2]5/2\n= N\n2\n\u00b50m 2 4\u03c0a3 \u00d7\u22123 \u2211 ijk (\u22121)i+j(i\u2212 12 )(j \u2212 12 ) sin(\u03c6a + \u03c6b) [(i\u2212 12 )2 + (j \u2212 12 )2 + \u03b72(k \u2212 12 )2]5/2 . (S69)\nIn the first line, we have used the translation symmetry. The factor ofN/2 comes from the number of sites in sublattice 0. There is no double counting factor. In the second line, we have used the symmetry properties: \u2211 (\u22121)i+j = 0,\u2211(\u22121)i+j(i\u22121/2)2 = 0, etc. We thus write:\nEAB N = A\u2032 \u00b50m\n2\n4\u03c0a3 sin(\u03c6a + \u03c6b), (S70)\nwhere the numeric constant\nA\u2032 = \u22123 2 \u2211 ijk (\u22121)i+j (i\u2212 1 2 )(j \u2212 12 ) [(i\u2212 12 )2 + (j \u2212 12 )2 + \u03b72(k \u2212 12 )2]5/2 . (S71)\nUsing the lattice constants a = 3.872 \u00c5 and c = 12.516 \u00c5, a direct numerical summation of the series revealsA\u2032 = \u22124.2484\u00d7 10\u22122. Taking the experimentally measured static moment m = 2.25\u00b5B , we obtain the coupling:\nEAB N = \u22121.9891\u00d7 10\u22124 sin(\u03c6a + \u03c6b) (meV). (S72)\nMeanwhile, using the dipole-biquadratic model, we find the coupling between the two sublattices read:\nEAB N = \u2212 12a 2 2a2 + c2 DS2 sin(\u03c6a + \u03c6b) = \u22120.964DS2 sin(\u03c6a + \u03c6b). (S73)\nComparing the two, we obtain:\nDS2 = 2.063\u00d7 10\u22124 meV. (S74)\n19\nFIG. S6. (a) Spin flop transitions of the D-A model in [100] field. (b) Magnetization curve for typical model parameters.\nVII. SPIN FLOP TRANSITIONS OF THE DIPOLE-ANISOTROPY MODEL\nIn this section, we discuss the spin flop transitions of the dipole-anisotropy model. When the field is along the [100] direction, the model exhibits a first order spin flop transition, at which the magnetization curve shows a sudden jump. This is inconsistent with the experimental results.\nThe analysis of the spin flop transitions of the dipole-anisotropy model is similar to that of the dipole-biquadratic model. We consider the case with the field \u2016 [100]. Again, we divide the system into A and B sublattices, each hosts a three-dimensional N\u00e9el order parametrized by the azimuthal angle \u03c6a (\u03c6b). The total energy reads:\nEtot N = \u2212 (g\u00b50B) 2 32J1 (sin2 \u03c6a + sin 2 \u03c6b)\u2212 12a2 2a2 + c2 D sin(\u03c6a + \u03c6b) + A\u2032S4 8 (sin2 2\u03c6a + sin 2 2\u03c6b). (S75)\nHere, the first term is the energy due to the magnetic field; the second the dipolar interaction; and the third the magnetocrystalline spin anisotropy. We define \u03c6+ = \u03c6a + \u03c6b and \u03c6\u2212 = \u03c6a \u2212 \u03c6b, and rewrite the energy as:\nEtot N = B cos\u03c6+ cos\u03c6\u2212 \u2212D sin\u03c6+ \u2212 A 4 cos 2\u03c6+ cos 2\u03c6\u2212, (S76)\nwhere B,D have been defined before, and\nA = A \u2032S4\n2 , (S77)\nis the energy scale of the spin anisotropy energy. The stationary condition reads:\nsin\u03c6\u2212(\u2212B cos\u03c6+ +A cos 2\u03c6+ cos\u03c6\u2212) = 0; sin\u03c6+(\u2212B cos\u03c6\u2212 +A cos 2\u03c6\u2212 cos\u03c6+)\u2212D cos\u03c6+ = 0. (S78)\nThe Hessian matrix reads:\nM = [ \u2212B cos\u03c6+ cos\u03c6\u2212 +A cos 2\u03c6+ cos 2\u03c6\u2212 B sin\u03c6+ sin\u03c6\u2212 \u2212A sin 2\u03c6+ sin 2\u03c6\u2212 B sin\u03c6+ sin\u03c6\u2212 \u2212A sin 2\u03c6+ sin 2\u03c6\u2212 \u2212B cos\u03c6+ cos\u03c6\u2212 +D sin\u03c6+ +A cos 2\u03c6+ cos 2\u03c6\u2212 ] . (S79)\nWe find two locally stable solutions:\n\u2022 Orthogonal state. This state is identical to that of the zero-field state. It corresponds to the following solution:\n\u03c6+ = \u03c0\n2 ; \u03c6\u2212 = \u00b1\n\u03c0 2 (S80)\nThe Hessian matrix reads:\nM = [ A \u00b1B \u00b1B A+D ] . (S81)\n20\nThe stability requires:\nB2 \u2264 B2s1 = A(A+D). (S82)\nThe energy of this state is:\nEtot N = \u2212D \u2212 A 4 . (S83)\n\u2022 Collinear state. In this state, the N\u00e9el vectors are collinear. The angles are determined by the following transcendental equation:\n\u03c6\u2212 = 0; A sin\u03c6+ cos\u03c6+ = D cos\u03c6+ + B sin\u03c6+. (S84)\nWe define B = \u221a B2 +D2 cos \u03b8 and D = \u221a B2 +D2 sin \u03b8. The equation now reads:\nsin(\u03c6+ + \u03b8) = A\u221a B2 +D2 sin\u03c6+ cos\u03c6+. (S85)\nNumerically, it is much more convenient to seek the minimum of the energy function:\nEtot N\n= \u221a B2 +D2 cos(\u03c6+ + \u03b8)\u2212\nA 4 cos 2\u03c6+. (S86)\nThe Hessian matrix reads:\nM =\n[ \u2212B cos\u03c6+ +A cos 2\u03c6+ 0\n0 \u2212B cos\u03c6+ +A cos 2\u03c6+ +D sin\u03c6+\n] . (S87)\nWe expect that the collinear state is stable when B \u2265 Bs2, where Bs2 must be determined numerically.\nWe have numerically determined the value of Bs1 and Bs2 and mark the region of local stability for both orthogonal and collinear states. We find that Bs1 \u2264 Bs2. This implies that there is a region where both local minima are stable \u2014 this indicates a first order transition. We therefore must determine the transition by comparing the energy at these local minima.\nThe magnetization:\nM\u2016\nN =\n(g\u00b50) 2B 16J1 \u00d7 { 1 (B \u2264 Bc) 1\u2212 cos\u03c6+ (Bc \u2264 B) ; (S88)\nM\u22a5\nN =\n(g\u00b50) 2B 16J1 \u00d7 { 0 (B \u2264 Bc) \u00b1 sin\u03c6+ (Bc \u2264 B) (S89)\nThe angle \u03c6+ has to be determined by solving the equation."
