Introduction\nDielectric capacitors, which store charge and electrostatic energy play crucial roles in electrical and electronic systems because of their ultrafast charge/ discharge rate (ultrahigh power density), high working voltage, and durability.[1\u20133] A typical dielectric material can be polarized by an electric field, and the electrostatic energy is then stored in displaced dipoles, say, polarization (Note S1 and Figure S1, Supporting Information). Thus, materials with a large maximum polarization Pm and small remanent polarization Pr after charging and discharging, respectively, are expected to exhibit high energystorage density and efficiency, as well as low loss and high breakdown strength. Thin-film capacitors have attracted considerable attention because of their higher\nbreakdown strength (on the order of megavolts per centimeter) compared to their bulk counterparts and because of their compactness and miniaturization potential.[4,5] The ferroelectric (FE) domain is a key issue for dielectric films for energy storage, as Pm and Pr are strongly affected by the domain configuration and switching dynamics. A widely accepted method of domain manipulation is to increase the compositional complexity to break the long-range-ordered FE domains into polar nanoregions (PNRs).[6,7] The highly dynamic PNRs can be switched back and forth under electric fields in a flattened energy landscape with less energy dissipation.[8,9] Thus, a high energy-storage density of >50\u00a0 J cm\u22123 and a high efficiency of \u224860\u201380% can be obtained simultaneously.[10\u201312] In addition, domain polymorphs[4] and superparaelectrics obtained by further domain scaling-down[13] have been proposed recently, enriching the methodology of domain engineering.\nHowever, most current methods are composition-based, and physical modification receives little attention. The recent discovery of polar topologies in stacked FE multilayers suggests new possibilities for domain engineering and opportunities to further improve the energy performance. The elegant interplay of elastic, electric, and gradient energy enabled by elastic and electric boundary conditions has revealed flux-closure domains in PbTiO3/SrTiO3 (PTO/STO) multilayers;[14,15] polar vortices,[16,17] antivortices,[18] skyrmions,[19] and waves[20] in PTO/ STO superlattices; and polar merons[21] in strained PTO. These\nDielectric capacitors are emerging energy-storage components that require both high energy-storage density and high efficiency. The conventional approach to energy-storage enhancement is polar nanodomain engineering via chemical modification. Here, a new approach of domain engineering is proposed by exploiting the tunable polar topologies that have been observed recently in ferroelectric/paraelectric multilayer films. Using phase-field simulations, it is demonstrated that vortex, spiral, and in-plane polar structures can be stabilized in BiFeO3/SrTiO3 (BFO/STO) multilayers by tailoring the strain state and layer thickness. Various switching dynamics are realized in these polar topologies, resulting in relaxor-ferroelectric-, antiferroelectric-, and paraelectric-like polarization behaviors, respectively. Ultrahigh energy-storage densities above 170 J cm\u22123 and efficiencies above 95% are achievable in STO/ BFO/STO trilayers. This strategy should be generally implementable in other multilayer dielectrics and offers a new avenue to enhancing energy storage by tuning the polar topology and thus the polarization characteristics.\nAdv. Mater. 2022, 34, 2108772\n\u00a9 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH2108772 (2 of 10)\nFE films with topological polar arrays have intricate polarization structures and rich domain configurations in which a large proportion of the domain walls consist of nonequilibrium polarization states; the polar vortex lattice, e.g., contains continuously rotating dipoles surrounded by tetragonal (T) domains.[16] Polar topologies have exhibited several novel electrical responses, such as local topology manipulation[22,23] and negative capacitance.[24,25] However, the relationships between the polar topology and the high-field domain dynamics, polarization behaviors, and energy-storage performance remain elusive.\nIn this work, we construct BiFeO3 (BFO)/STO multilayers to study polar domain engineering for dielectric energy storage. BFO possesses robust ferroelectricity comparable to that of PTO, and its rhombohedral (R) phase in bulk form can be more flexibly tuned by varying the epitaxial misfit strain.[26] Therefore, BFO may afford more abundant topologies when its phase symmetry is tuned; however, this possibility has not attracted much attention. STO insulating layers create open-circuit boundary conditions and establish discontinuous polarization\nacross the interface; these features are similar to those in other FE/paraelectric (PE) heterostructures.[14,18,20,27] To minimize the electric energy, the polarization at the interface tends to rotate toward the in-plane direction, enabling the formation of periodic closure domains.[16,28] (001)-oriented STOm/BFOm/STOm trilayers (where m is the layer thickness in unit cell (u.c.)) are designed coherently on the substrate (Figure 1a); hereafter, this structure is abbreviated (m/m/m), and pseudo-cubic indices are used. Phase-field modeling is implemented to simulate the domain evolution and examine the hysteresis loops at various strains and layer thicknesses (see the Experimental Section)."

The strain in the trilayers is considered unrelaxed because of the small film thickness. The isotropic SLP is between 3.82 and 4.00 \u00c5, which corresponds to in-plane strains \u03b5 of \u22123.7% (compressive) to 0.9% (tensile), considering that the lattice parameter of bulk BFO is 3.965 \u00c5.[29] The polar structures change from vortices to spirals and then entirely to in-plane domains as the strain changes from compressive to tensile (Figure\u00a0 1b). Highly compressive strain (\u22123.7% to \u22122.1%) induces T-like and monoclinic phases with polarization close to the [001] direction and constrained in the (010) plane, respectively (Figure\u00a0 1c), in agreement with previous studies.[26,30] In this case, two adjacent domains are alternated by 180\u00b0 in polarization direction, with continuous polarization rotation, and the BFO layers show vortex configurations with a topological number of +1 (Figure\u00a01b, upper left panel, and Note S2, Supporting Information), analogous to vortex arrays in T-PTO/STO superlattices.[16] As the compressive strain becomes moderate (\u22122.1% to \u22121.1%), the BFO phase is transformed to an R-like phase whose polarization gradually rotates from the [aa1] (a\u00a0<\u00a01) to the [111] direction (Figure\u00a01c). The 180\u00b0 domains degrade to alternating R-like 109\u00b0 domains, accompanied by vortex cores shifting to the BFO/ STO interfaces in a wave pattern (Figure\u00a01b, upper right panel), as a bridge of topology transition. After the vortex core passes through the interface, a purely spiral-like (i.e., without vortices in the BFO layer) periodic R-domain configuration is stabilized (\u22121.1% to \u22120.1%, Figure\u00a0 1b, lower left panel, Figure S2, and Note S2, Supporting Information). The spiral is identified from a previous study of polar topologies in PTO/BFO/STO multilayers.[31] Note that under slight compressive strain (i.e., \u22121.1% to \u22120.1%), the polarization is along the [aa1] direction (a\u00a0>\u00a0 1), with a smaller out-of-plane component owing to the relatively large depolarization induced by interface charges. This vortex\u2013 spiral (or dipole wave) transition is similar to that observed in PTO/STO,[20] but the latter has a much narrower window for the occurrence of spirals (strains of 1.2\u20131.6%) because of the tetragonality of PTO, which does not favor slant polarization. Notably, the coexistence of polar vortices and spirals is consistent with experimental results for BFO/GdScO3 multilayers at a strain of \u2248\u22122.4%,[32,33] and long-range arrays of 109\u00b0 domains were also observed in BFO films on TbScO3 substrates with negligible strain mismatch.[34] Trilayers with applied tensile strains (e.g., 0.9%) have in-plane domains, where the out-of-plane component approaches zero (Figure\u00a01b, lower right panel).\nA 2D phase diagram is presented in Figure\u00a01d; it shows that polar structures appear at different strains and layer thicknesses. The transition from vortices to spirals is progressive, and thus a gradual color change is displayed. The sharp boundary line is defined by the presence of vortices in the BFO layers, i.e., it separates structures containing vortices from those containing only spirals in BFO. Trivial domains are stable at smaller thicknesses (Figure S3, Supporting Information) in ultrathin regimes, which is ascribed primarily to excessive mechanical interaction via misfit strain.[35] In thicker films, the vortex cores must shift further before reaching the interface, which delays the critical strain level at which the vortex\u2013spiral transition appears (Figure\u00a01d, vortex\u2013spiral boundary). For example, when the strain is \u22120.6%, spirals are stable for m\u00a0= 13\u201315, but vortices are stable for m\u00a0= 18\u201330 (Figure\u00a0 1b, lower left panel,\nand Figure S4, Supporting Information). By contrast, interfacial depolarization has a smaller effect, stabilizing the out-of-plane polarizations and extending the occurrence window of vortex and spiral states (Figure\u00a0 1d, vortex\u2013spiral and spiral\u2013in-plane domain boundaries). The strain and thickness enable a complicated interplay between the elasticity, depolarization, and geometry, resulting in abundant polar topologies.\nAn energetic study was also performed to understand the emergence of static polar topologies in the (13/13/13) trilayer. First, we address the occurrence of tunable polar topologies rather than single R domains. The total free energy trends of both the individual layers and the entire trilayer are similar to those of the elastic energy (Figure\u00a0 1e and Figure S5a,b, Supporting Information). This result indicates that the topology transition is driven primarily by strain, which introduces lattice distortion into different symmetries to accommodate the mechanical boundary conditions and decrease the elastic energy. Therefore, the uniform domains of polarization (i.e., regions between two adjacent vortices, or two curved spirals) have the lowest elastic energy, which is governed by the strain (Figures S6d,i and S7d, Supporting Information). However, because monodomains are electrically unfavorable owing to the electric boundary conditions and depolarization field, multidomain structures form and are accompanied by topological domain walls with low electric energy and rotational polarizations (Figures S6e,j and S7e, Supporting Information). The rapid change in polarization inevitably results in a large gradient energy at vortex cores and spiral curvatures, leading to a high gradient energy at the domain wall (Figures S6c,h and S7c, Supporting Information). Overall, trilayers with polar topologies have lower (or approximately the same) free energies compared to single domains (Figure S7a, Supporting Information). The only exception is a large stable uniform domain stabilized in ultrathin films with compressive strain, possibly because: 1) the strong strain elasticity prohibits any domain walls such as vortices or spirals, and 2) the decrease in domain free energy cannot compensate for the appearance of high-energy domain walls.[36]\nNext, we show the change from vortices to spirals and inplane domains in terms of energy. We calculated the free energies of the three units over the entire strain range, as shown in Figure\u00a0 1f. Vortices have the lowest free energy at strains of \u22123.7% to \u22122.1%. As the strain changes from compressive to tensile, the free energies of polar vortices and spirals compete at strains of \u22122.1% to \u22121.1% until the spiral becomes the only energy-allowed state (Figure\u00a01f). Under tensile strain, in-plane domains are the most stable state. In particular, within compressive regions where trilayers exhibit topologies, free energy decay (Figure S7a, Supporting Information), in which all the energy terms decrease (Figure S7b\u2013e, Supporting Information), implies that lower compressive strain progressively drives the polarization into Landau double wells (Figure S7b, Supporting Information) and facilitates a less energy-intensive structure with less rotation (from 180\u00b0 to 109\u00b0 domain walls)."

Mater. 2022, 34, 2108772\n\u00a9 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH2108772 (4 of 10)\ndirection. The dynamic domain evolution of vortices (strain, \u22123.7%) and spirals (strain, \u22120.1%) are presented in Figure 2a,b and Figure S8 in the Supporting Information. Under an upward electric field, adjacent clockwise and anticlockwise vortices separated by a downward domain approach each other but do not switch until a sufficiently high field is reached, indicating that the vortex states have high coercivity. By contrast, spirals that endure 109\u00b0 switching can be fully polarized to a uniform state with only 3 MV cm\u22121. To investigate the spatial stability of the polar topologies, Figure\u00a02c quantitatively visualizes the coercive fields of every dipole in two topologies under an applied field. In Figure\u00a02c1, the downward domain between two vortices has a radial coercivity distribution. When the electric field increases, the polarizations near vortices are switched, and thus the vortex cores approach each other. The central part of the downward domain, with a width of \u22485 u.c., exhibits an extremely high coercive field (over 8 MV cm\u22121) for 180\u00b0 switching, which causes abrupt disruption of the vortices at high fields. This stiffness of polarization maintenance in highly strained BFO thin films has been observed experimentally,[37,38] and strong coercivity of vortices (>5 MV cm\u22121) has appeared in other phasefield simulations.[39] By contrast, the coercivity of the spiral in Figure\u00a02c2 is only one-third that of the vortices and varies little within the downward region; thus, a process of spiral flattening and switching occurs.\nTo examine the origin of the large dynamic difference between vortices and spirals, we calculated the changes in the switching energy of their downward dipoles. The dipole between vortices encounters a high energy density barrier of \u22481 \u00d7 109 J m\u22123, which consists primarily of Landau (10%), gradient (50%),\nand elastic terms (30%) (Figure\u00a0 2d). Spirals, by contrast, have a far lower free energy density barrier of \u22484 \u00d7 107 J m\u22123, which is almost completely a Landau barrier (Figure\u00a0 2e). In addition, if we convert the temporal switching to spatial switching, e.g., to study the energy variance across a vortex and spiral, the free energy density barrier can also be estimated. The energy change along the two dashed lines penetrating polar topologies in Figure S9 in the Supporting Information is plotted. The free energy density of the barrier extracted by static analysis is quite consistent with that obtained by dynamic analysis, indicating that the switching path is as follows. The downward dipole between two vortices experiences two continuous 90\u00b0 processes, and that in spirals undergoes 109\u00b0 switching. The switching energetics demonstrate that the large polarization gradient and elastic intolerance of vortices account for their higher coercivity and stronger topological protection compared to spirals. Figure\u00a02f shows a monotonous decrease in the switching energy density of the barriers and coercive fields with strain. Vortices maintain a free energy density barrier of >108\u00a0 J m\u22123 and a coercivity >3\u00a0 MV cm\u22121, whereas spirals are more easily switched and quickly degrade to in-plane domains without switching barriers. The unique features and large contrasts in the switching dynamics of various polar topologies can dramatically affect their collective polarization behaviors."

In addition, Figure\u00a0 3c shows the upward polarization percentage in the BFO layer of the (13/13/13) trilayers under various upward electric fields. All the polar structures have negligible remanent polarization because the alignment of the out-of-plane component Pz is antiparallel for vortices and spirals and zero for inplane domains. When the strain is between \u22123.7% and \u22122.1%, where pure vortices are maintained, the trilayers, like relaxor ferroelectrics (RFEs), are polarized with high saturation polarization but near-zero remanent polarization and exhibit almost no hysteresis (Figure\u00a03a), which is highly desirable for energy storage. The upward polarization accounts for less than 80% at 5 MV cm\u22121 in this case (Figure\u00a03c), indicating that vortices are preserved. Driven by the electric field, dipoles near vortices with relatively low coercivities are locally and reversibly switched, but coercive domain walls (i.e., vortices) remain unswitched. After the field is removed, the partially switched trilayer returns to the topologically protected, regular vortex state as an eigenstate. This represents the triple-well free energy landscape shown schematically in Figure\u00a0 3b1.[40] When two adjacent domains with antiparallel polarizations are taken as a supercell, the landscape ultimately has three free energy minima at the net polarization of zero and the spontaneous polarizations, respectively. Because of the strong coercivity and large switching barrier, the dipoles, when poled by a 5 MV cm\u22121 field, do not reach Landauenergy-driven wells, which contributes to the nonhysteretic nature of the trilayer. At small compressive strains of \u22121.6% to \u22120.1%, the P\u2013E loops are antiferroelectric-like (AFE-like), although the parent materials are not AFE (Figure\u00a0 3a). The spirals exhibit good electrical stability, which enables reversible switching at low fields; however, irreversible switching and FE hysteresis occur at high fields (Figure\u00a03a) and are related to spiral disruption and recovery. In this case, the switching barrier is much lower, and the topology-stabilized triple-well landscape is traversed (Figure\u00a0 3b2). This phenomenon is analogous to those observed in magnetic topologies[41,42] and nanostructured polar vortices[43] and provides a route to the design of artificial double hysteresis loops with delayed polarization and increased energy-storage density. Experimental studies of FE/PE superlattices have also suggested that anomalous capacitance peaks\nAdv. Mater. 2022, 34, 2108772\n\u00a9 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH2108772 (6 of 10)\nresembling the AFE\u2013FE transition occur under nonzero electric fields.[44\u201346] Note that the AFE-like behavior here is conceptually different from antiferroelectricity, because dipole switching does occur in the linear segment (Figure\u00a03c, \u22121.6%, \u22120.6%, and \u22120.1%). In the tensile region (e.g., 0.9%, Figure\u00a03a), the trilayers exhibit PE behavior because in-plane domains are thermodynamically favored at zero field. Thus, the out-of-plane direction, in analogy to the hard magnetization axis, is not the preferred polarization direction, and along this direction the free energy in single-well form is minimum only at zero field (Figure\u00a0 3b3).[47] Figure\u00a0 3d compares the components of the remanent polarizations of trilayer (13/13/13) as a function of strain. Although the sum of the remanent Pz, which represents the curl of the polar topologies, remains unchanged, that of the norm |Pz|, which represents the magnitude of the out-ofplane polarization, decreases owing to the effect of strain.[48,49] Similarly, the maximum polarization decreases monotonously with strain (Figure\u00a03a and Figure S10, Supporting Information). Notably, PE STO layers also exhibit considerable polarization (up to 0.3 C m\u22122) owing to the strain and internal field.[15,18]\nTo generalize our findings for the (13/13/13) trilayer, Figure\u00a0 3e summarizes the polarization behavior of all the trilayers as functions of strain and thickness m, and all the loops are plotted in Figure S11 in the Supporting Information. In contrast to vortices, spirals, and in-plane domains, trivial domains behave like a typical FE material with a large coercive field and remanent polarization. Note that with increasing m, the vortices diminish more slowly; thus, the RFE window is\nlonger in thicker trilayers. The blue dashed lines in Figure\u00a03e are the boundaries in Figure\u00a0 1d that separate different polar topologies, and the black dashed lines separate various types of P\u2013E loops. The two boundaries are roughly homologous, implying that the correlation between the polar topologies and macroscopic polarization behaviors is universal. The universally topology-stabilized slimmer P\u2013E loops should enhance energy storage over a broad range."

            "text": "Thus far, we have comprehensively investigated the strained trilayers both statically and dynamically using a 2D crosssectional model. It is also necessary to understand how these polarization structures expand horizontally and become organized; to this end, we performed a simulation using 3D grids. Figure 4a presents the horizontal planar domain distributions, where red and blue regions represent upward and downward polarization, respectively. The effects of strain on the topologies at domain walls in the 3D models are consistent with the 2D cross-sections (Figure S12, Supporting Information). Two domain configurations are present: striped domains typical of BFO appear at strains of \u22123.7% to \u22122.4% and \u22120.4% to 0.9%, whereas bubble domains appear at moderate compressive strains of \u22122.1% to \u22120.4%. The formation of striped and bubble domains can be understood in terms of the competition\nAdv. Mater. 2022, 34, 2108772\n\u00a9 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH2108772 (7 of 10)\nof domains and domain wall energies. For strains of \u22120.4% to 0.9%, the large in-plane polarization component reduces the depolarization field and domain free energy and thus stabilizes large striped domains. Consequently, at strains of \u22122.1% to \u22120.6%, the larger out-of-plane polarization component should result in the formation of small domains (bubble domains). However, because the vortex core is in a high-energy state (Figure S6a, Supporting Information), the highly compressed (strain above \u22122.6%) trilayers exhibit striped domains because of the considerable domain wall free energy. This result is consistent with reports of PTO/STO superlattices,[19,50] deemed as strain-induced Rayleigh\u2013Taylor instability.\nThe P\u2013E loops derived from the 3D grid model are plotted in Figure\u00a04b. The P\u2013E loops of the striped domains have the same shape as those of the 2D models; counterintuitively, these large regular stripe arrays favor slim loops. Vertical cross-sections of the striped domains at a strain of \u22122.6% (Figure\u00a0 4c, panels 1 and 2) show the same vortex configuration, which is also the same as that of the 2D models (Figure\u00a0 1b); thus, their collective dynamics are consistent and synchronous and can be represented by a single cross-section (Figure\u00a04d). Bubble domains are more like RFEs with some hysteresis, which conceals the unique AFE-like loops. The reason is that slices of bubble domains are quite distinctive from those of striped domains; their 2D polar structures are inhomogenous at different positions (Figure\u00a0 4c, panels 3 and 4), and some of the structures at bubble edges are unlike those in the 2D models. At zero field, bubbles form randomly, and upward and downward polarizations are not evenly distributed, leading to a visible remanent polarization. By contrast, because the bubbles are\nirregularly distributed, the collective dynamics of the polarizations are changing and nonsynchronous (Figure\u00a04e), analogous to the movements of PNRs. However, this phenomenon has little effect on energy storage because the hysteresis of bubbles is similar to that of AFE-like loops. It was recently suggested that the stripe\u2013bubble transition is electric-field-related,[51,52] where higher electric fields stabilize striped domains, whereas low fields favor bubble domains. As shown in Figure S13 in the Supporting Information, when a 7.5 MV cm\u22121 field is applied to the trilayer, the bubble domains change to striped domains, and AFE-like loops reappear, indicating that the planar domain configurations can be affected by a dynamic poling process.[53]"

            "text": "Next, the energy-storage performance was investigated. The energy-storage density and efficiency of the trilayers under an electric field of 5 MV cm\u22121 were calculated from the P\u2013E loops based on our 2D model, as shown in Figure 5a,b, respectively. The FE region has the lowest energy-storage density and efficiency because of the large FE loss; however, all the other topologies have a high energy storage density (>80 J cm\u22123) and efficiency (>70%). In particular, the RFE-like profile caused by vortices, which has high saturation polarization and almost zero hysteresis, results in the highest energy-storage density of >110\u00a0J cm\u22123 at 5 MV cm\u22121 with >98%\u00a0efficiency. The reason is the polarization enhancement (\u22481.5 C m\u22122 in the BFO layer) caused by the compressive strain, near-zero out-of-plane net polarization resulting from the stable vortex eigenstate, and\nAdv. Mater. 2022, 34, 2108772\n\u00a9 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH2108772 (8 of 10)\nnonhysteretic polarization behavior resulting from the high coercivity of the polar vortices (>5 MV cm\u22121). The AFE-like segment also has a high energy-storage density of 90\u2013110 J cm\u22123 but a relatively low efficiency of 70\u201390% owing to the switching loss. The PE-like regime exhibits a low energy-storage density of less than 90 J cm\u22123 because of the small maximum polarization; however, it is 100% efficient. The energy-storage density of the 3D model exhibits essentially the same behavior as that of the 2D model (Figure\u00a0 5c); however, the maximum energystorage density is slightly higher (121 J cm\u22123) because of the slight polarization delay. The efficiency minima arise from bubble domains in addition to spiral disruption. The trilayers exhibit much better energy-storage performance over the entire strain range and most of the thickness range compared to STO and BFO layers in series (Figure\u00a05c and Figure S14, Supporting Information), demonstrating the contribution of the polar topologies to the performance.\nThe electric-field-dependent energy storage of the trilayers at fields of up to 7 MV cm\u22121 was also calculated using the 2D and 3D models (Figure\u00a0 5d and Figure S15, Supporting Information, respectively), and the corresponding hysteresis loops are presented in Figure S16 in the Supporting Information. In both models, the energy-storage parameters are of the same magnitude, whereas electric-field-related effects are responsible for slight deviations in efficiency. Imperfect stripe configurations decrease the efficiency of the films at a strain of \u22123.7% in the 3D model. AFE-like behaviors disrupt the topology of the trilayers under a strain of \u22122.6% at 6 MV cm\u22121; however, the AFE\u2013FE transition occurs earlier in the 3D model, causing a more pronounced decrease in efficiency. The bubble\u2013stripe transition is responsible for the change from RFE-like behavior to AFE behavior in the 3D model of the trilayers under a strain of \u22121.1% at 7 MV cm\u22121. The energy-storage density of vortices was 178 J cm\u22123 at 7 MV cm\u22121 with 95% efficiency (2D) and 171 J cm\u22123 with 85% efficiency (3D), and that of spirals was 156 J cm\u22123 with an efficiency exceeding 90%. The energystorage capacity achieved here surpasses most of the reported values for lead-free and lead-based systems.[4,5,11,12,47,54] The superior energy-storage performance in a wide variety of polar topologies demonstrates that FE multilayers show promise for use as energy-storage media."

            "text": "We systematically studied the polar topologies, polarization dynamics, and energy-storage properties of BFO/STO multilayers. The topology, which was tuned by varying the strain and thickness, has unique dynamics and determines the type of P\u2013E loops in the 2D model. The coercivity and switching dynamics of stiff vortices and flexible spirals are revealed energetically; they generate unexpected RFE features with minimal hysteresis and AFE-like behavior with double hysteresis loops, respectively. In the 3D model, striped and bubble domains form. The loops of striped domains are the same as those in the 2D models, but those of bubble domains are of the RFE type regardless of polar topology. Thus, the polarization behavior is ultimately a combination of topology and domain effects. We obtained maximum energy-storage densities of 121 J cm\u22123 (3D model) and 116 J cm\u22123\n(2D model) with ultrahigh efficiency (exceeding 90%) at 5 MV cm\u22121, and an energy-storage density of 178 J cm\u22123 with an efficiency of 95% at 7 MV cm\u22121. Our simulation results offer comprehensive insights into the tunability of the polarization topology and reveal the relationship between the polar topology and P\u2013E characteristics. The design of FE multilayers opens a path to improving the energy-storage capability by exploiting controlled FE orders. Our strategy of tuning the polar topology and P\u2013E characteristics may be implemented in other materials such as hafnia if the mechanical and electric boundary conditions are satisfied, and we hope our work motivates experimental studies that explore new approaches to developing dielectrics with superior energy-storage performance."

In the z-direction, 20, 3m, 3, and \u03be represent the substrate, trilayer itself, interfacial layers, and air above the film, respectively. The parameters of the interfacial layer were the averages of those of two adjacent layers. In the 3D simulations, the y grid was the same as the x grid, i.e., 100\u0394. The domain structures and P\u2013E loops were obtained under a short-circuit boundary condition.[56] The mechanical boundary condition was that the out-of-plane stress on the top of the film was zero, whereas the displacement was zero at the bottom of the substrate. Periodic boundary conditions along the x and y directions were used. The lattice parameters for BFO and STO were set to 3.965[29] and 3.905 \u00c5,[57] respectively.
