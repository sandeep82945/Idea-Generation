1. **Investigate the role of CB2 receptor in other inflammatory diseases:** Explore the potential of CB2 receptor agonism as a therapeutic strategy in other inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and multiple sclerosis.


2. **Study the molecular mechanisms underlying CB2 receptor-mediated anti-inflammatory effects:** Conduct detailed mechanistic studies to elucidate the signaling pathways and molecular interactions involved in CB2 receptor-mediated suppression of inflammation.


3. **Evaluate the efficacy of CB2 receptor agonists in animal models of DMD:** Assess the therapeutic potential of CB2 receptor agonists in animal models of DMD, examining their impact on muscle inflammation, fibrosis, and functional outcomes.


4. **Investigate the potential of CB2 receptor agonists in combination with other DMD therapies:** Explore the synergistic or additive effects of CB2 receptor agonists when combined with existing DMD therapies, such as corticosteroids, gene therapy, or myoblast transfer therapy.


5. **Conduct clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CB2 receptor agonists in DMD patients:** Design and conduct clinical trials to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of CB2 receptor agonists in DMD patients, evaluating their impact on inflammatory markers, muscle function, and overall disease progression.
