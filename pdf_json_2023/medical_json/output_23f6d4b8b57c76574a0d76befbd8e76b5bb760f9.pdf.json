Randomized comparative clinical [randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT)] studies on nab-P plus platinum and carboplatin or cisplatin in combination with conventional chemotherapy agents or traditional paclitaxel were searched.\nResults: A total of 19 RCT studies involving 6,011 patients were analyzed. The primary outcome includes the overall response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), and progression-free survival (PFS). The secondary outcome includes adverse events (AEs). Nab-P combined with platinum (carboplatin/cisplatin) had a better ORR [odds ratio (OR) = 1.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.34, 2.05), p < 0.001] and improved PFS [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.84, 95% CI: (0.74, 0.94), p = 0.01] and OS [HR = 0.86, 95% CI: (0.78, 0.96), p = 0.008] in NSCLC patients. ORR [OR = 2.18, 95% CI: (1.07, 4.43)], PFS [HR = 0.62, 95% CI: (0.40, 0.97)], and OS [HR = 0.63, 95% CI: (0.49, 0.81)] were significantly improved among patients aged >70 years, and ORR [OR = 1.80, 95% CI: (1.20, 2.70)] and PFS [HR = 0.74, 95% CI: (0.56, 0.97)] were significantly elevated with SCC rate \u226565% in NSCLC patients (all p > 0.05). Among the adverse e ects, the prevalence of neutropenia, neuralgia, and arthralgia/myalgia (\u2265 grade 3) compared to that of the control group. On the other hand, the prevalence of anemia and thrombocytopenia was higher in the nabP plus platinum (carboplatin/cisplatin) compared to that of controls. It is worth noting that fatigue did not show statistical significance.\nConclusion: Nab-P in combination with carboplatin/cisplatin regimen improves e cacy and tolerability in patients with NSCLC.\nSystematic review registration: http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/, identifier: CRD42022288499.\nKEYWORDS\nnon-small cell lung cancer, nab-paclitaxel, chemotherapy, e cacy, safety, meta-analysis\nFrontiers inMedicine 01 frontiersin.org"

Based on the cellular origin, lung cancer can be classified into two major categories, namely, small cell type and non-small cell type (2), with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) constituting\u223c85% of the lung cancer (3). NSCLC is categorized into three subtypes, namely, lung adenocarcinoma, squamous cell lung cancer, and large cell carcinoma (4). NSCLC patients with a survival rate of 5 years are only \u223c15%, as the majority of patients with NSCLC are unresectable or metastatic at diagnosis (5) and are unsuitable for excision surgery, but they instead ought to undergo aggressive systemic therapy (consisting of chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or a combination of both) to achieve a good benefit. Nowadays, nab-P plus platinum compounds have been recommended as chemotherapy regimens to cure advanced NSCLC (6, 7).\nNab-P, a paclitaxel of solvent micelles-free, was revealed superior response rates and tolerability than solvent-based paclitaxel treatment regimens with patients in NSCLC and MBC (8). Albumin, as a natural transport carrier, is a general carrier for drug delivery into tumors due to features of abundance in blood and long half-life (9), with high accumulation in tumor tissues. It seems that promoting albumin binding to albuminspecific receptor mediated transport mechanisms to access tumors"

In the study (10), nab-paclitaxel (nab-P) and sb-paclitaxel were radiolabeling then quantified the paclitaxel reaching tumors presenting that tumors have absorbed one-third more nab-P. This likewise illustrated that nab-P takes advantage of albumin mechanisms so that it could reach tumors more advantageously and consequently inhibit tumor growth.\nThe NCCN guidelines suggest that albumin-bound paclitaxel combined with platinum was used as standard treatment (6). A stage III/IV squamous NSCLC, clinical trial, indicated the beneficial effects of nab-P plus platinum compounds as the firstline chemotherapy for patients who have commonly used advanced NSCLC (12). In addition, in a clinical trial, among patients with NSCLC aged \u226560 years, nab-P plus carboplatin (nab-P + C) considerably increased overall response rate (ORR; 34 vs. 25.6%) and prolonged overall survival (OS; 13.8 vs. 11.0months) compared with solvent-based paclitaxel in combination with carboplatin; however, it did not significantly show progression-free survival (PFS; 6.9 vs. 5.7 months). Among adverse effects, the maximum number of neutropenia incidence (\u2265 grade 3) was lower in nabP + C than sb-paclitaxel plus carboplatin (134 vs. 152) and the incidence of anemia (74 vs. 16) or thrombocytopenia (45 vs. 20) is slightly higher in nab-P+ C (13).

In an analysis of subgroups according to median age, the nab-P + C/Cis regimen significantly increased ORR and extended the duration of PFS and OS in the age > 70 years arm. Furthermore, by subgroup analysis depending on the SCC rate, the nab-P + C/Cis regimen was found to enhance ORR and growth in PFS greater in the SCC rate \u2265 65% arm. This implies that nab-P+ C/Cis chemotherapy regimens may benefit more dramatically in older patients with NSCLC and patients with squamous cell carcinoma.\nAEs can be separated into hematologic and non-hematologic events, based on the occurrence of neutropenia with the highest rate. Among the adverse results (grade \u2265 3) that showed in terms of hematological toxicities, when compared to carboplatin or cisplatin in combination with conventional chemotherapy agents or traditional paclitaxel, anemia [3.54 (2.59, 4.85)] and thrombocytopenia [2.05 (1.56, 2.71)] markedly increased in patients who were treated for nab-P+C/Cis, and neutropenia [0.92 (0.85, 0.99)] was relatively lower. In relation to non-hematological toxicities, neuropathy [0.26 (0.21, 0.34)] and arthralgia/myalgia [0.22 (0.14, 0.35)] occurred less in the nab-P + C group.\nFIGURE 10 GRADE evidence profile for all outcome measures.\nFrontiers inMedicine 15 frontiersin.org\nHowever, significantly more incidence of gastrointestinal reactions [1.71 (1.21, 2.41)] were observed in nab-P + C/Cis compared with carboplatin/cisplatin in combination with conventional chemotherapy agents or traditional paclitaxel. Moreover, fatigue [0.86 (0.70, 1.06), p = 0.155] did now show a statistically significant difference.\nIn a present meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of nabP in combination with carboplatin for NSCLC, Tan et al. (31) demonstrated that, in comparison to control, nab-P+ C improved ORR and extended PFS and OS. In the area of AEs, nab-P + C raised the incidence of anemia (grade \u2265 3) and diminished the risk of grade \u2265 3 neuropathy and arthralgia. There was no previous meta-analysis of nab-P + Cis intervention in NSCLC, but a review analysis (32) has reported an aggressive effect of nab-P + Cis intervention in NSCLC, with a tendency to obtain a higher ORR and improved PFS and OS. nab-P + Cis was more well-tolerated as illustrated in the trial by Hattori et al. (33). Our findings were similar to those that have been reported.\nPatients significantly benefit in terms of ORR after nabP + C/Cis chemotherapy (12, 17). The mechanism of action of albumin combined with carboplatin/cisplatin for intervention against NSCLC may be to utilize albumin features for increasing the antitumor role of the drug. Tumors may be fed by albumin as a nutritive substance in the tumor microenvironment and it possibly promotes tumor growth (34). Nab-P, an albumin-bound drug, leverages these mechanisms to enhance the delivery specifically to tumors that an affinity for albumin. The gp60 receptorspecific endothelial cells activate transmembrane transport, and albumin accumulates in the tumor environment by the EPR effect to reach tumors (8, 10, 11). The studies show that the coadministration of albumin-bound paclitaxel with gemcitabine enhances the gemcitabine levels in tumors of a mouse model of pancreatic cancer (35, 36). This supports the possibility that albumin-bound paclitaxel could increase the level of combined drugs reaching the tumor, but more research data are required to support this.\nThis meta-analysis included clinical studies of nab-P in combination with cisplatin, and it had a higher total sample size. Second, contour-enhanced funnel plots and Begg\u2019s and Egger\u2019s tests demonstrated that no evidence of publication bias was observed in this study. Besides, outcome quality was graded according to grade guidelines, and correlations for ORR, PFS, and OS with intervention dose and intervention duration were estimated using a regression analysis. However, there are several limitations to this analysis. First, the study shows considerable heterogeneity with respect to ORR, PFS, OS, neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Although using the subgroup analysis and a random-effects model, there is no way to decrease heterogeneity. In the second place, with two of the accepted articles, no HR was provided and calculated using Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curves,\nwhich may cause a potential risk of bias (22, 26). Finally, most of the studies of nab-P + Cis in terms of primary data are unavailable or unable to calculate HR for PFS and OS, and AEs are not graded."

However, PFS and OS do not show any particularly visible benefit; therefore, a greater number of studies will be demanded to explore further. Based on the efficacy and tolerability of nab-P combined with carboplatin/cisplatin, it may provide an economically disadvantaged patient with an affordable treatment option."
