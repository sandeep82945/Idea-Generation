    "abstractText": "The Mitochondrial Complex I Assembly (MCIA) complex is essential for the biogenesis of respiratory Complex I (CI), the first enzyme in the respiratory chain, which has been linked to Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) pathogenesis. However, how MCIA facilitates CI assembly, and how it is linked with AD pathogenesis, is poorly understood. Here we report the structural basis of the complex formation between the MCIA subunits ECSIT and ACAD9. ECSIT binding induces a major conformational change in the FAD-binding loop of ACAD9, releasing the FAD cofactor and converting ACAD9 from a fatty acid \u03b2oxidation (FAO) enzyme to a CI assembly factor. We provide evidence that ECSIT phosphorylation downregulates its association with ACAD9 and is reduced in neuronal cells upon exposure to amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) oligomers. These findings advance our understanding of the MCIA complex assembly and suggest a possible role for ECSIT in the reprogramming of bioenergetic pathways linked to A\u03b2 toxicity, a hallmark of AD.",

McCarthy 4, Eaazhisai Kandiah 1, Irina Gutsche 2,5 & Montserrat Soler-Lopez 1\nThe Mitochondrial Complex I Assembly (MCIA) complex is essential for the biogenesis of respiratory Complex I (CI), the first enzyme in the respiratory chain, which has been linked to Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) pathogenesis. However, how MCIA facilitates CI assembly, and how it is linked with AD pathogenesis, is poorly understood. Here we report the structural basis of the complex formation between the MCIA subunits ECSIT and ACAD9. ECSIT binding induces a major conformational change in the FAD-binding loop of ACAD9, releasing the FAD cofactor and converting ACAD9 from a fatty acid \u03b2oxidation (FAO) enzyme to a CI assembly factor. We provide evidence that ECSIT phosphorylation downregulates its association with ACAD9 and is reduced in neuronal cells upon exposure to amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) oligomers. These findings advance our understanding of the MCIA complex assembly and suggest a possible role for ECSIT in the reprogramming of bioenergetic pathways linked to A\u03b2 toxicity, a hallmark of AD.\nA worldwide research effort is currently underway to identify the factors driving Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) pathogenesis in order to find better ways to diagnose the disease, delay its onset and prevent progression. Due to their high energy demands and limited glycolysis rate, neurons depend on an efficient oxidative metabolism\u2014i.e., oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and fatty acid beta-oxidation (FAO)\u2014and are particularly vulnerable to mitochondrial dysfunctions. Because of this, age-related degradation of mitochondria is a prime suspect in AD pathophysiology1,2. Notably, in the brain of AD patients amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptides progressively accumulate within mitochondria and perturb the mitochondrial respiratory Complex I (CI)3, a ~1 MDamembrane protein complex composed of 44 different subunits (encoded in the mitochondrial and nuclear genome) that is essential for OXPHOS4. Despite its central importance, how CI is altered by A\u03b2 and relates to neuronal integrity remains an open question. While the molecular structure of the core CI subunits has been determined in atomic detail5, much less is known about the biogenesis of CI. This multistep process involves transiently associated assembly factors that integrate core and accessory/supernumerary subunits as well as cofactors into the final holoenzyme. A key player in CI biogenesis is the mitochondrial CI assembly (MCIA) complex6. This complex consists of three core proteins\u2014NDUFAF1, ACAD9 and ECSIT \u2014that appear to further associate with three peripheral membrane proteins6. The organisation of the MCIA complex and its role in CI assembly are unclear, partly because the individual MCIA components also mediate other cell functions. In particular, ACAD9 was annotated as an acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACAD) enzyme due to its sequence\nReceived: 13 March 2023\nAccepted: 21 November 2023\nCheck for updates\n1Structural Biology Group, European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), 38043 Grenoble, France. 2Institut de Biologie Structurale, Universit\u00e9 Grenoble Alpes, CEA, CNRS (IBS), 38044 Grenoble, France. 3European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), 69117 Heidelberg, Germany. 4European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), 38043 Grenoble, France. 5Department of Chemistry, Ume\u00e5 University, Ume\u00e5, Sweden. e-mail: irina.gutsche@ibs.fr; montserrat.soler-lopez@esrf.fr\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:8248 1\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\nhomology (47% amino acid identity and65%amino acid similarity)with the very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase VLCAD7, which both can initiate the FAO pathway with the concurrent reduction of their FAD cofactor8. In turn, ECSIT participates in cytoplasmic and nuclear signalling pathways, in which different ECSIT isoforms and posttranslational modifications might contribute to its functional complexity9. Furthermore, ECSIT was identified as a molecular node interacting with A\u03b2-producing enzymes10, potentially implicating it in AD pathogenesis11.\nWe and others recently discovered that C-terminal ECSIT binding triggers ACAD9 deflavination, switching it from an FAO enzyme to a CI assembly factor12,13. These two mutually exclusive functions allow for the coordinated regulation between distinct multifunctional protein complexes to ensure efficient energy production. Here we provide high resolution structural insights into the MCIA subcomplex, ACAD9WT-ECSITCTER, and identify the conformational changes that ACAD9 undergoes upon ECSIT binding. We provide experimental evidence of in vitro and ex cellulo ECSITphosphorylation and its effect on the ACAD9-ECSIT interaction and reveal a decrease in ECSIT phosphorylation levels upon exposure to A\u03b2 oligomer toxicity. These findings will pave the way for evaluating MCIA proteins as potential diagnostic biomarkers for detecting early AD pre-symptomatic stages when mitochondria are primarily affected by A\u03b2 toxicity14."

            "text": "A 15-residue ECSIT peptide is essential for complex formation with ACAD9 We previously reported a cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of ACAD9 in complex with a C-terminal fragment of ECSIT (ECSITCTD, residues 247\u2013431) at low (~15 \u00c5) resolution\n12. The inclusion of an additional N-terminal 26 residues in the ECSIT construct (hereafter namedECSITCTER, residues 221\u2013431), combinedwithoptimisation of the purification and subcomplex reconstitution protocols (Supplementary Fig. 1A\u2013D) led to a 3.0\u00c5 resolution cryo-EM structure of the ACAD9WT-ECSITCTER complex (Fig. 1, Supplementary Figs. 3, 4A, 5A\u2013D and Supplementary Table 1), enabling us to build and refine an atomic model that includes nearly all ACAD9 residues as well as a 15-residue peptide spanning ECSIT residues 320\u2013334 (Fig. 1A, B, E). As previously described15, ACAD9 is present as a dimer, where the C-terminal regions (residues 600\u2013621) form helix loops that are positioned around the neighbouring protomer thereby stabilising the active dimer (Fig. 1B, C). Such helix swapping has been suggested to promote the stability of the homodimer in structural homologues adopting the same C2symmetry16. The ACAD9 monomer consists of an N-terminal dehydrogenase domain (res. 38\u2013453 comprising an \u03b1-helical, a \u03b2-sheet and a second \u03b1-helical subdomains) and a C-terminal \u03b1-helical bundle vestigial domain (res. 487\u2013587) connected by a poorly ordered ~35- residue linker (Fig. 1A, C). As expected, no significant density was observed for the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) in the dehydrogenase domain, confirming our previous observation that the binding of ECSIT triggers the deflavination of ACAD912.\nThe ECSIT binding site is located at the junction of the ACAD9 dehydrogenase and vestigial domains (Fig. 1A\u2013D), with one ECSITCTER per ACAD9 protomer. ECSIT residues 322\u2013328 form a 310-helix that interacts with the ACAD9 \u03b21\u2013\u03b22 loop, while ECSIT residues 329\u2013334 adopt an extended loop conformation lying in anti-parallel orientation between the ACAD9 \u03b116 and \u03b76 helices (Fig. 1C, D). Examination of the electrostatics properties of the binding interface shows that the surface of the ACAD9 is mainly positively charged whereas the modelled ECSIT sequence is mostly negative (Fig. 1F). Details of ECSITCTER recognition by the ACAD9 dehydrogenase/vestigial interface, showing key binding interactions, are summarised in Fig. 1D.\nMutations within the ECSIT helix exhibited distinct characteristics upon analysis of the ACAD9WT-ECSITCTER complex formation, emphasising the specificity of the ACAD9-ECSIT interaction. In\nparticular, an ECSIT-E323A mutation underscores the significance of the salt bridge formation between ECSIT Glu323 and ACAD9 Lys228, resulting in the absence of binding, as evidenced bymass photometry and DLS (Fig. 2A, H). The relevance of the pyrrole-containing aromatic sidechain and hydrogen bond between ECSIT Trp324 and ACAD9 Ser191, located on the tip of the \u03b21\u2013\u03b22 loop, was demonstrated by a reduction in complex formation of ACAD9 with an ECSIT-W324A mutant (Fig. 2B, H). An ACAD9-S191A mutant further confirmed the lower affinity for ECSITCTER (Supplementary Fig. 2A and Fig. 2G\u2013I), though this mutant showed higher stability compared to ACAD9WT, with less dissociation into monomers (Supplementary Fig. 1B and Fig. 2G). Interestingly, despite their positioning in the ACAD9 binding pocket (Fig. 1D, E), ECSIT residues Tyr327 and Tyr328 do not appear to strongly interact with any ACAD9 residues (Fig. 1D). Replacement of these Tyrosine residues by either Phenylalanines or Alanines shows that the loss of the hydrophobic nature/\u03c0-bonding and hydrogen bonding capabilities of Tyr327 has a more pronounced impact on complex formation than the removal of the hydrogen bonding partner only, whereas the removal of both the hydrophobic/\u03c0-bonding and hydrogen bonding properties of Tyr328 permitted complex formation (Fig. 2C\u2013F, H). In summary, it canbededuced thatwhile all interactions play a significant role, the stability of the complex primarily relies on the salt bridge formation between ECSIT residue Glu323 and Lys228 of ACAD9, as well as the crucial hydrogen bonds established between Trp324 of ECSIT and ACAD9 residues Ser191/Asp188 (Supplementary\nTable 2).\nFor additional insights, we used AlphaFold2 (AF2)17 to predict the structure of the ACAD9-ECSIT complex using sequences matching our constructs. The AF2model predicted the binding site to contain ECSIT residues 316\u2013338 and closely resembled the experimental structure (RMSD of 1.635 \u00c5 over 552C\u03b1 atoms; Supplementary Fig. 6A\u2013C). No additional ECSIT residues were predicted to contact ACAD9, suggesting that most, if not all, of the specific interactions between these proteins were captured in the cryo-EM structure. Indeed, we found that a synthetic peptide spanning ECSIT residues 318\u2013336 was sufficient to cause the deflavination of ACAD9 (Supplementary Fig. 2B), confirming that these residues are crucial for complex formation. Notably, the full lengthAF2model available from thedatabase predicts that ECSIT comprises two flexibly linked globular domains, an N-terminal domain (res. 70-208) with a pentatricopeptide repeat fold and a C-terminal domain (res. 221\u2013392) with an RNaseH-like fold comprising a six-stranded mixed \u03b2-sheet and four short helices18. The ACAD9-binding residues of ECSIT reside within the C-terminal domain and localise to the tip of a long loop (res. 306\u2013357) containing a 310- helix that is flexibly connected to strands \u03b24 and \u03b25 of the RNaseH-like domain. This turns to be very close to a density extension observed in our earlier low-resolution map of ACAD9-ECSITCTD\n12 (Supplementary Fig. 6D, E), allowing this domain to be positioned within the extra density with only aminor adjustment of the long predicted \u03b24-\u03b25 loop. The long linkers (residues 306\u2013320 and 335\u2013356) (Supplementary Fig. 6A, D) connecting the ACAD9 binding region of ECSIT to the RNaseH-like C-terminal domain likely contribute to the high flexibility observed in biophysical analyses12 (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. 6D).\nECSIT opens the FAD-cofactor gatekeeper loop of ACAD9 upon binding In order to identify structural changes thatoccur inACAD9upon ECSIT binding, we pursued a cryo-EM structural study of ACAD9WT in the unbound state. Given a strongly preferred orientation (Supplementary Fig. 5A, B) resulting in an anisotropic 3D reconstruction and limiting the resolution of the finalmap to ~5.0\u20135.5 \u00c5 in the core and ~ 6.5\u20138.0 \u00c5 in the periphery (Supplementary Fig. 5E, F), the analysis was restricted to a rigid body fit of the ACAD9 AF2 model (residues 38\u2013621) (Supplementary Fig. 4B). Considering the observed stability and compactness of the ACAD9S191A mutant (Fig. 2G, H), we chose it as a\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:8248 2\nsuitable candidate for further improving the ACAD9 structure. To increase the orientational diversity, we collected a 35\u00b0 tilted cryo-EM data set (Supplementary Fig. 5A, B) and solved the structure of ACAD9S191A at 3.6\u00c5 resolution (Supplementary Figs. 4C, 5G, H, 7A\u2013C). Consistent with FAO activity, the structure features one molecule of FAD in the cofactor binding site of each ACAD9 protomer (Supplementary Fig. 7C, D). As expected, no significant density occupies the ECSIT binding site identified in the ACAD9WT-ECSITCTER structure. Strikingly, comparing the structures of ACAD9 alone and in complex with ECSITCTER reveals that, in addition to causing\nFig. 1 | Cryo-EM structure of the ACAD9WT-ECSITCTER complex.

C Ribbon diagram of the refined structure of the ACAD9WT-ECSITCTER complex coloured as in (A).DKey interactions involved in ECSITCTER recognitionby the ACAD9 dehydrogenase/vestigial interface. Specifically, ECSIT Glu323 makes a salt bridge with ACAD9 Lys228, stabilising the ECSIT binding on the N-terminal segment with the ACAD9 \u03b24 strand, whereas a second salt bridge between ECSIT Asp333 and ACAD9 Arg446 stabilises the ECSIT binding on the C-terminal end with the ACAD9 \u03b116 helix. Furthermore, ECSIT directly interacts with the ACAD9 \u03b21\u2013\u03b22\nloop through three hydrogen bonds between ECSIT Trp324 and ACAD9 Ser191 and Asp188, respectively, and ECSITGlu323with the backbone amide of Ile192.Notably, while there is no evidence of direct ECSIT interactions with the second ACAD9 protomer, Asp188 shows an additional hydrogen bond with Asn333 on \u03b111\u2019\u2013\u03b112\u2019 loop, bridging ECSIT binding with the ACAD9 dimer. Numerous intramolecular hydrogen bonds within ECSIT contribute to the stability of the conformation. In particular, Thr320 forms a hydrogen bond with Gln331 while Asn325 interacts with the backbone amideofGlu322 andMet330, respectively. EClose-up of the cryo-EM map of the ECSITCTER peptide. F Representation of the electrostatic properties at the ACAD9WT-ECSITCTER binding interface as calculated byAPBS electrostatics. The surface of the junction between the vestigial and dehydrogenase domains of ACAD9 is mainly positively charged (blue). In comparison, the ECSIT sequence modelled from the cryo-EM map contains hydrophobic and polar residues (grey) but principally carries a negative charge. Negatively charged residues Glu322, Glu323 and Asp333 are represented as red sticks for clarity.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:8248 3\ndeflavination, ECSIT binding induces a large conformational change in the \u03b21\u2013\u03b22 loop adjacent to the FAD binding site (Figs. 3 and 5D, E). In particular, the structure of ACAD9S191A shows that this loop adopts a closed, downward facing position, forming hydrogen bonds with the \u03b111-\u03b112 loop of the neighbouring monomer (Supplementary Fig. 7C) and thereby acting as a barrier between the adenine nucleotide of the FAD molecule and the external solvent (Fig. 3A, C and Supplementary Fig. 8A, D). In contrast, the loop adopts a very different conformation in the ACAD9WT-ECSITCTER model (Fig. 3B, D, E and Supplementary Fig. 8B, E), where the tip of the \u03b21-\u03b22 loop (residue Gly186) moves by ~10\u00c5 upwards to allow the ECSIT 310-helix to insert, suggesting that thismobile ACAD9 \u03b21-\u03b22 loop plays the role of a gatekeeper (Fig. 3F). Although it does not directly interact with the FAD molecule, we suggest that removal of this barrier destabilises the cofactor environment, leading to deflavination and the reassignment of ACAD9 from an FAO enzyme to a CI assembly factor. The downward facing loop position in ACAD9S191A clashes with the superposed ECSIT 310-helix indicating that the flipping mechanism is\nFig. 2 | Analysis of interface derived mutants on ACAD9WT-ECSIT complex formation. Several mutants were designed to probe the complex interface and identify the role of the residues in complex formation. The mutant species were reconstituted with the corresponding WT protein and compared with ACAD9WTECSITCTER. A Mass photometry assays show that ECSITCTER-E323A severely impacts the formation of the complex, with no MW corresponding to ACAD9-ECSITCTERE323A observed. B ECSITCTER-W324A negatively impacts complex formation, with the MW of the main species similar to ACAD9WT. C ECSITCTER-Y327F complexes with ACAD9WT but also forms higher order species. D ECSITCTER-Y327A affects complex formation similarly to (B).

H DLS assays show that all ECSIT mutants show a reduced average MW (130\u2013150 kDa) in comparison to the ACAD9WT-ECSITCTER complex, indicating partial complex formation but a reduction in stability. ACAD9S191A has a MW very similar to ACAD9WT, however, in complex with ECSITCTER, there is the formation of higher MW species.

However, increasing the threshold of the unsharpened ACAD9WT map reveals some density at the base of ACAD9S191A model, hinting at their possible position. Thus, we fitted the missing residues into this signal, using the coordinates of the ACAD9 AF2 model where residues 455-464 and 475-492 form flexible loops, sandwiching a short \u03b1-helix (res. 465-474). The lack of definition in the density points to a mobility of this region (Supplementary Fig. 7E) andmay be explained by the lack of contacts between the \u03b1-helix and the ACAD9 core. Interestingly, we do not see signal for these residues in the ACAD9S191A dataset, probably due to a larger number of particles being included in the higher resolution reconstruction, leading to the signal being averaged out due to highmobility.\nACAD9 has structural features unique among the ACAD family The comparison of our ACAD9S191A structure with both the VLCADbased ACAD9 homology model7 and a very recently published VLCAD crystal structure (PDB:7S7G19) revealed ahigh structural similarity,with\nRMSD values of 1.16 \u00c5 and 1.11 \u00c5, respectively (Fig. 4A). A visualisation of the evolutionary conserved residues also reveals that the dehydrogenase domains are quite conserved within the ACAD family20 (Fig. 4B). Intriguingly, and in agreement with previous studies7,12, ACAD9 is the only ACAD family member capable of binding ECSIT and assisting CI assembly (Supplementary Fig. 2A), whereas VLCAD does not fulfil these functions12. Thus, given that the ECSIT binding induces the flipping of the gatekeeper loop, we generated ACAD9 point mutants intended to mimic the VLCAD sequence on this loop and analysed thembyDLS andmass photometry. In regards to their ECSITbinding properties, these mutants behave essentially like ACAD9WT (Fig. 4C\u2013F), suggesting that, although the conformational flexibility of theACAD9gatekeeper loop is important for the dimer stability and the enzymatic activity, it is nevertheless not decisive to confer its ability to bind ECSIT.\nTherefore, in our quest to identify the distinct ECSIT binding features of ACAD9, we compared the FAD cofactor sites between our ACAD9 structure and the reported VLCAD structure (Fig. 5A, B and Supplementary Fig. 8A\u2013C)16. InACAD9, the FADmolecule is situatedon top of the core strands and adopts an elongated conformation for\n0.0\n1.0\n2.0\n3.0\n4.0\n5.0\n6.0\n7.0\n8.0\n9.0\n10.0\nPr o1\n83 Ala 18 4 Se r18 5 Gl y1 86 Se r18 7 As p1 88 Ala 18 9 Ala 19 0 Se r19 1 Ile 19 2 Ar g1 93 Se r19 4 Ar g1 95 Ala 19 6\nA\nC D\nB\nC \u03b1-\nC \u03b1\ndi st\nan ce\n(\u00c5 )\nAla 17\n6 Ala 17 6 Ph e1 78 Cy s1 79 Le u1 80 Th r18 1 Gl u1 82\nG186 G186\nE F\nFig. 3 | A gatekeeper loopmovement of 10\u00c5 is induced uponECSITCTER binding to ACAD9.

The overall architecture of the pocket is analogous in both proteins. However, in ACAD9 the volumeof the FADbindingpocket is larger and bonding interactions between the ACAD9 protein and the FAD molecule are longer andweaker (Supplementary Fig. 8A, C), suggesting that the fold of the FAD-binding domain and the cofactor conformation are not independent, whereby the arrangement of the domain determines the position and shape of the pocket and thus the cofactor conformation.\nInterestingly, in VLCAD, twoMethionine residues located on a 310- helix (res. 437\u2013443) from the second protomer make sulfur-\u03c0 interactions with a Tryptophan residue (W209) and the FAD isoalloxazine moiety of the first protomer, while in ACAD9 the corresponding Leucine and Threonine residues are unable tomediate similar interactions with the equivalent Tryptophan (W213) (Fig. 5A, B). We thus generated an ACAD9 mutant, ACAD9VLCAD, to mimic VLCAD by replacing residues 401LGGLGYT407 by the corresponding VLCAD residues 437MGGMGFM443 (Fig. 5D, E). Although ACAD9VLCAD forms a stable\ndimer, exhibiting a profile similar to VLCAD by mass photometry (Fig. 5D), it does not appear to form a complex with ECSITCTER. Furthermore, the presence of ECSITCTER seems to induce dissociation of ACAD9VLCAD into monomers (Fig. 5D, E). On the other hand, although the counterpart VLCADACAD9 mutant (Fig. 5C, E) appears to form a less stable dimer than the VLCADWT, it forms a complex with ECSITCTER, even if larger species also appear (Fig. 5C, E). Collectively, these findings suggest that in VLCAD, the dyad of Methionine residues located on a helix in the N-terminal \u03b1-helical domain (\u03b1-dom2) of the neighbouring protomer (as described in ref. 16) are responsible for stabilising the FAD in the binding pocket (Fig. 5A, B). This ability to retain the FAD cofactor is directly correlated with the stability of the homodimer but inversely correlated with the ability to bind ECSIT.\nLastly, another potential site that could account for the differences between ACAD9 and VLCAD in CI assembly lies on the 35- residue linker (res. 450-485 in ACAD9 and 486\u2013521 in VLCAD), which shows the highest sequence divergence between the two proteins7. The recently reported VLCAD crystal structure models most of those residues (res. 486-499) facing away from the protein and projecting\n214FCLTEPSSGSDAASIRTS231\n178FCLTEPASGSDAASIRSR195\nVLCAD\nACAD9\nVLCAD\nACAD9\n0 100 200 300 400 500 0.00\n0.02\n0.05\n0.07\n0.10\nA\nB\n131\u00b130\nACAD9A184S/SR194TS + ECSITWT\n266\u00b146\nACAD9A184S/SR194TS\n120\u00b118\n124\u00b148\nVLCADWT + ECSITWT\n121\u00b123\nVLCADWT\nA184S SR194TS A184S/ SR194TS\nWT\nVL CA\nD\nA1 84\nS\nSR 19\n4T S\nA1 84\nS/S R1\n94 TS\nACAD9 dimer ACAD9dimer + 2xECSITCTER\nD\nt= 0s\nt = 300s\nFl uo\nre sc\nen ce\nra tio\n0.92\n0.94\n0.96\n0.98\n1.00\n1.02\n0.8508\n<0.0001\n<0.0001\n0.3179\nMW (kD)\n176\u00b157\nACAD9WT + ECSITWT\nC\nFE\nvariable average conserved\n\u03b21-\u03b22 loop\nN or\nm al\nis ed\nc ou\nnt s\nMass [kDa]\nN or\nm al\nis ed\nc ou\nnt s\nMass [kDa]\nWT\n50\n150\n250\n350\n450\n550\n650\n750\n- + - + - + - +\n0 100 200 300 400 500 0.00\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\nFig. 4 | The FAD-gatekeeper loop stabilises theACADdimeric conformationbut does not determine ECSIT binding.

The double mutant ACAD9SR194TS is destabilised, although the effect was less profound in complex with ECSITCTER; some complex is formed but at higher MW than ACAD9WT-ECSITCTER. In contrast,\nthe double mutant ACAD9A184S/SR194TS shows no change in MW before and after reconstitution with ECSITCTER, however, we can attribute this to a reduction in protein stability while retaining the ability to bind ECSITCTER.

This extended loop mediates trans interactions with the equivalent loop of another symmetry related VLCAD molecule (Supplementary Fig. 9A), stabilising the quaternary conformation of a dimer of homodimers19. However, superposition with the ACAD9WT structure reveals that in ACAD9 this loop tucks into the core of the same homodimer instead (Supplementary Fig. 9B). The higher conformational flexibility in VLCAD could be accounted by Gly488 at the end of \u03b116 helix, which turns to be a hydrophobic residue (Ile452) in ACAD9 (Supplementary Fig. 9B). Excitingly, alignment with the ACAD9WT-ECSITCTER complex structure shows that residues of the VLCAD flexible loop are in fact positioned near the ECSIT binding site in the ACAD9WT-ECSITCTER complex (Fig. 1D and Supplementary\nFig. 9C). Therefore, it appears that the equivalent ECSIT binding site on VLCAD can be obstructed by the loop from another monomer. In fact, a structural alignment on this region between VLCAD residues 486-498 and ECSIT residues 320\u2013334 (reversed to match VLCAD sequence positioning, 334-320) shows some overlap in hydrophobic character (Supplementary Fig. 9D). In summary, these observations suggest that even if VLCAD contains an equivalent ECSIT binding site, it is unable to specifically bind ECSIT as it can be blocked by VLCAD itself. This auto-inhibitory feature would not be the case for ACAD9,\nas the equivalent sequence of residues are dissimilar (Supplementary\nFig. 9D), indicating another possible reason for the specificity of ACAD9 for ECSIT in comparison to VLCAD.\nECSITCTER is phosphorylated and has an impact on MCIA complex stability In addition to its pivotal role in the MCIA complex, ECSIT was also described as providing a bridge betweenToll-like receptor (TLR) signal transduction and downstream signalling kinases9. Previous studies have shown evidenceof ECSIT ubiquitination by the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6 in the cytoplasm, which leads to ECSIT enrichment at the mitochondrial periphery to generatemROS21 and its translocation into the nucleus to regulate NF-\u03baB activity22. Furthermore, another study reported a non-identified post-translationally modified form of ECSIT dependent on a MAPK kinase activity and apparently required for its role in the TLR pathway9. Therefore, to gain an insight into ECSIT regulatory mechanisms and given the frequent crosstalk between ubiquitination and phosphorylation, we investigatedwhether ECSIT undergoes phosphorylation in the presence of MAPK kinases and whether this has an impact on ACAD9-ECSIT subcomplex formation.\n0 200 300 400 500 0.00\n0.02\n0.05\n0.07\n0.10\n100\nF425\nE426\nFAD FAD Y406\nF442\nL401\nW213\nE260\nL404\nT407\nW249\nF461\nE462\nI457 M437\nM440 M443\nMYC\n65\u00b114 126\u00b114\n234\u00b142\n150\u00b137\n0 100 200 300 400 500 0.00\n0.02\n0.05\n0.07\n0.10\n100\n120\n140\n160\n180\n200\n220\n240\n260\n280\n300\nAC AD\n9\nAC AD\n9 VL CA\nD\n+ E CS\nIT C TE\nR\n+ E CS\nIT C TE\nR\n+ E CS\nIT C TE\nR\nVL CA\nD AC AD\n9\nMW (kD) ACAD9 dimer ACAD9 dimer + 2xECSITCTER\nA B\nC D E\nI421\n435QIMGGMGFMKE445 399QILGGLGYTRD409\n176\u00b157\nVLCADACAD9 + ECSITCTER ACAD9WT + ECSITCTER\nVLCADACAD9\n64\u00b116 113\u00b127 117\u00b113\n176\u00b157\nACAD9VLCAD + ECSITCTER ACAD9WT + ECSITCTER\nACAD9VLCAD\nN or\nm al\nis ed\nc ou\nnt s\nMass [kDa]\nN or\nm al\nis ed\nc ou\nnt s\nMass [kDa]\nFig. 5 | Identification of the features that distinguishes ACAD9 from VLCAD. A Three Methionine residues (M437, M440, M443) are situated at the top of the VLCAD FAD site and contribute to the stability of the FAD molecule by M440 and M443 forming sulfur-\u03c0 interactions with the isoalloxazine moiety and W209. B Unlike VLCAD, ACAD9 has a Threonine and two Leucine residues (in red) and is unable to provide stability to the FADmolecule.CMass photometry analysis shows that when VLCAD is mutated to mimic ACAD9 (VLCADACAD9, pink), there is a reduction in stability compared to VLCADWT (Fig. 4C). When reconstituted with ECSITCTER, there is a shift in the MW, indicating the formation of a VLCADACAD9ECSITCTER complex (in blue). D The reverse mutation of ACAD9 to mimic VLCAD (ACAD9VLCAD) produces a more stable dimer (pink). Upon reconstitution of ECSITCTER, we see an appearance of amonomeric ACAD9VLCAD (blue) indicating the destabilisation of the ACAD9 dimer and no significant shift to a higher MW,\ndemonstrating a stark reduction in the ability of ACAD9VLCAD to form a complex with ECSITCTER in comparison to WT (orange). Experiments were repeated thrice with similar results. E DLS measurements of ACAD9WT, ACAD9VLCAD and VLCADACAD9 show similar behaviour.However, in the caseof ACAD9VLCAD, there is a significant reduction in complex formation in comparison to ACADWT-ECSITCTER, implying that thismutation does indeed evoke VLCAD-like tendencies. The reverse is also true in the case of VLCADACAD9, a large average MW is seen, indicating the formation of a VLCADACAD9-ECSITCTER complex. This indicates that VLCADACAD9 behaves less like VLCADWT and more like ACAD9WT through the mutation of these key residues. Blue and red dashed lines indicate the expected MW for ACAD9 homodimer and ACAD9WT-ECSITCTER complex, respectively. Data are presented as mean values \u00b1 SD of at least n = 3 biological replicas. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:8248 7\nWe first examined the potential phosphorylation of ECSIT in vitro by incubating ECSITCTER with a well-characterised MAPK kinase, p38\u03b1, activated in the response to ROS to function as a redox sensor23. Furthermore, p38\u03b1 has been implicated in several neuronal functions that are relevant for brain physiology and has also been detected in the early stages of AD23, making it a logical kinase candidate for our in vitro studies. Native gel electrophoresis showed that ECSITCTER migrates with higher mobility upon p38\u03b1 kinase treatment (Fig. 6A), consistent with the gain of one or more negatively charged phosphate groups. Subsequent radiolabelling analysis confirmed the presence of strong 32P-labelled bands in ECSITCTER treated with activated p38\u03b1, indicating the direct phosphorylation of ECSIT by p38 MAPK kinase in vitro (Fig. 6B). Analysis of the faster migrating band by proteolytic in-gel digestion mass spectrometry revealed that ECSITCTER was multiphosphorylated (Supplementary Data 2). We were able to identify nine high-confidence Threonine/Serine phosphorylation sites, including a kinase recognition sequence TSS motif (res. 401\u2013403)24 (Fig. 6C). Excitingly, one of the identified potential phosphorylation sites was Thr320, which resides within the ECSIT sequence visible in our ACAD9WT-ECSITCTER structure (Fig. 6C). Thr320 forms hydrogen bonds with Gln331, stabilising the helical sequence that enters into the ACAD9 binding cavity. We therefore constructed an ECSITCTER\n0 1.0\u00d710 9 2.0\u00d710 9 3.0\u00d7109\npS404\npS403\npS396\npT320\npS269\n0 2.0\u00d710 9 4.0\u00d710 9 6.0\u00d710 9\npS431\nECSITCTER\np38\u03b1(i)\np38\u03b1(a) ATP\n_\n+ +\n++ + __ ___\n++ ___\n____ +++\n_ ECSITCTERECSITCTERECSITCTER ECSITCTER MKK6DDMKK6DD MKK6DD\n32P-ECSIT\nC\nA B\nE\nD ACAD9WT + ECSITWT ACAD9WT + ECSITT320E\nCI activity reaction time (min)\nO D\n45 0n\nm\nP < 0.0001\nP < 0.0001\nn.s.\nECSITCTER H4WT\nECSITCTER\ncell extract\nH4WTH4APP H4APP\n32P-ECSIT\n32P-p38\u03b1\np38\u03b1p38\u03b1 p38\u03b1\nATP \u03b3-32P\nF\nQ331 T320\nnormalised intensity (counts)\n176\u00b157\n121\u00b137\n303\u00b1152\nWT\nG 0,7 -\n1 - MDa\nMw WT APP P < 0.0001\nWT APP 0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n0:00 5:00 10:00 15:00 20:00 25:00 30:00 0.00\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\n0.04\nWT 0.01\nWT 0.1\nWT 0.5\nAPP 0.01\nAPP 0.1\nAPP 0.5 APP\n0 100 200 300 400 500 0.000\n0.015\n0.030\n0.045\nA\u03b2 42\nm ito\nch on\ndr ia\nl\npS2 69 pS2 39 pT2 54 pT3 20 pS4 31 pT3 80 pT3 83 pT4 02 pS 404\n221 431\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:8248 8\nphosphomimetic mutant where Thr320 was replaced by a Glutamate (T320E). Remarkably, this mutant exhibited a significantly reduced binding affinity for ACAD9 (Fig. 6D and Supplementary Fig. 10A), suggesting that the phosphorylation of Thr320 may negatively regulate ACAD9 binding.\nWe next sought to examine the potential ECSITCTER phosphorylation sites in vivo. To this end, we treated ECSITCTER with an endogenous kinase pool from human neuronal cells (Fig. 6E, F). We observed strong 32P-radiolabelling of ECSITCTER, providing evidence that ECSITundergoes phosphorylation ex cellulo. Subsequent analyses by proteolytic in-gel digestion mass spectrometry confirmed that ECSITCTER was multiphosphorylated (Fig. 6G), and identified six highconfidence Threonine/Serine sites, including five already detected in vitro: Ser269, Thr320, the TSS motif and the C-terminal residue Ser431 (Fig. 6C, G and Supplementary Data 3).\nECSITCTER phosphorylation is affected by A\u03b2 soluble oligomers In parallel, we performed a quantitative phosphoproteomic study upon exposure of ECSITCTER to soluble A\u03b2 oligomers (Fig. 6E, F). Intraneuronal A\u03b2 can translocate directly from the endoplasmic reticulum into mitochondria, where it may affect mitochondrial respiration25. Thus, we sought to investigate whether mitochondrial A\u03b2 alters the phosphorylation levels of ECSIT. Overexpression of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) carrying the AD-related Swedish mutation (KM670/671NL) in neuroglioma cells enables the investigation of the toxic A\u03b21-42 soluble oligomeric form as may occur during AD 26,27 (Fig. 6E, right inset). Interestingly, while we obtained similar levels of immunopurified CI from both cell types (Fig. 6E, left inset), the amyloidogenic cells exhibited a significantly enhanced NADHdehydrogenase activity (Fig. 6E, bottom), raising the possibility that soluble A\u03b21-42 oligomers lead to aberrant CI hyperactivity and could be a primary source of oxidative stress. Finally, we investigated whether the A\u03b21-42 soluble oligomers affect ECSITCTER phosphorylation and found that the degree of phosphorylation of the six phosphorylation sites differed greatly between wild-type and amyloidogenic neuronal cells, with a clear tendency to decrease upon exposure to amyloids (Fig. 6G and Supplementary Data 3)."

            "text": "The Mitochondrial Complex I Assembly complex (MCIA) is required for the biogenesis of Complex I and is therefore crucial for the activation of the OXPHOS system6. FAO and OXPHOS are key pathways involved in cellular energetics28. Despite their functional relationship, evidence for a physical interaction between the two pathways is sparse29. Understanding how FAO and OXPHOS proteins interact and how defects in these two metabolic pathways contribute to mitochondrial disease pathogenesis is thus of critical importance for the development of new tailored therapeutic strategies.\nHere, we provide high-resolution structural insights into the interface and assembly of the MCIA subcomplex ACAD9-ECSIT, with onemolecule of ECSIT bound to eachACAD9protomer at the crossing between the dehydrogenase and vestigial domains. ECSIT induces the flipping of the ACAD9 \u03b21-\u03b22 loop acting as gatekeeper by ~10 \u00c5 such as to allow the binding of an ECSIT segment (res. 320\u2013334) and the release of the FAD cofactor from ACAD9 (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Videos 1 and 2). Once formed, the complex is very stable (Supplementary Figs. 1A\u2013C and 2A). Based on the present data and our previously published low resolution information12, we propose this stability may arise from ECSIT\u2019s ability to envelop ACAD9, made possible by long stretches of flexible loops (res. 306\u2013320 and 335\u2013356, Supplementary Fig. 6A, D).\nFurthermore, the AF2-predicted ACAD9WT-ECSITCTER model supports our previous suggestions that ECSIT entwines around the vestigial domain of ACAD9 (Supplementary Fig. 6A, D)12, in contrast to an alternative SAXS model placing the ECSIT binding interface at the N-terminus of ACAD913. The fact that there is an overall low confidence in the position of the globular core of C-terminal ECSIT with respect to ACAD9 (Supplementary Fig. 6B) not only supports our experimental data but may also explain why the folded region of ECSIT is not visible in the ACAD9WT-ECSITCTER reconstruction: this region is probably highly mobile due to the flexibility of residues 306\u2013320 and 335\u2013356. Worthy of note, because AF2 is unable to predict conformational changes thatoccur during protein-protein interactions30, while theAF2 model corroborates the experimentally determined ACAD9WTECSITCTER interface, it does not predict the displacement of the gatekeeper loop.\nThe experiments with the ECSIT-mimicking short peptide identified from the cryo-EM map show that this stretch of residues is key to the deflavination of ACAD9 (Supplementary Fig. 2B). Intriguingly, despite the high similarity between the ACAD9 and VLCAD structures, only ACAD9holds the unique ability to bind ECSIT andparticipate inCI assembly7. In order to investigate key differential residues, we first examined the divergent residues on the gatekeeper loop. However, mutant analyses reveal that, even if the sequence of this loop has an impact in the acyl-CoA activity of the enzyme, the exact nature of the amino acids is not directly responsible for the formation of the complex with ECSIT (Fig. 4B\u2013F). We then examined the FAD binding site in both protein structures16 (Fig. 5A, B and Supplementary Fig. 8) to check whether the FAD binding stability is related to the ECSIT binding capacity. We observed that in fact, ACAD9 has a larger FAD binding pocket, leading to a reduced number of bonding interactions that are typically longer and therefore, weaker (Fig. 5A, B and Supplementary\nFig. 8A\u2013C). A less tightly bound cofactor is less stable and thus the feasibility of deflavination should be higher than if the FAD was tightly bound. Very interestingly, through the identification of VLCAD residues in the FADbinding, we have reversed the ACAD9 behaviour in the\nFig. 6 | Phosphorylation of ECSIT may regulate the binding affinity for ACAD9.

In fact, the counterpartmutation in VLCAD also induces a reversed behaviour, facilitating ECSIT binding to VLCAD (Fig. 5A, C, E). These findings suggest that changes in hydrophobicity/ \u03c0-bonding capabilities in the FAD binding pocket strongly affect the FAD stability and indirectly, the binding to ECSIT as well (Fig. 5A\u2013E). In fact, it appears that ACAD9 is in an equilibrium between two states characterised by a high FAD binding affinity in its closed conformation and a low FAD binding affinity in its open conformation. ECSIT seems to exert a non-competitive allosteric influence by stabilising the low FAD binding affinity state, even though there are no apparent clashes between ECSIT and FAD. Furthermore, re-examination of a VLCAD structure at higher resolution and in absence of fatty acid substrate revealed a unique quaternary structure of VLCAD homodimers stabilised by an extended conformation of the ~35 residue stretch at the base of VLCAD (residues 486\u2013521, Supplementary Fig. 9A) in contrast to the equivalent residues in ACAD9 (Supplementary Fig. 9B)19. Notably, this region is also where both proteins show the highest sequence divergence, which could further account for dissimilar conformational abilities. Remarkably, this extended loop occupies the equivalent ECSIT binding site (Supplementary Fig. 9C, D), suggesting that a reason why VLCAD is unable to bind ECSIT may be the obstruction of this binding site by VLCAD itself. Taken together, subtle differences in sequence are thus likely to play a critical role in impacting ACAD9ACAD9 and VLCAD-ECSIT interactions, possibly accounting for the differences between VLCAD and ACAD9 in CI assembly participation, as previously suggested7.\nOur finding that ECSIT undergoes phosphorylation raises the possibility that a post-translational modification may provide an\nadditional layer of regulation of MCIA complex assembly (Fig. 7). Although further investigation is required to determine the identity of the ECSIT kinases and the mechanism by which these might regulate MCIA complex formation, the identification of five high-confidence Threonine/Serine sites in ECSITCTER suggests a potential role for phosphorylation in modulating the ACAD9-ECSIT interaction. In particular, our analyses of the phosphomimetic mutant T320E suggest that phosphorylation at Thr320, either solely or in combination with other phosphorylation sites, could conceivably induce conformational changes that would disrupt the fitting of the ECSIT segment in the ACAD9 cavity (Fig. 6C, D). Notably, analysis of the segment sequence across species reveals a high amino acid conservation except for Thr320, which seems to have evolved in higher primates from an Isoleucine (Supplementary Fig. 10B). Along this line, it is interesting to highlight that Threonine is an intermediate in Isoleucine biosynthetic pathway, which supports the hypothesis that rapid evolution of phosphorylation sites could provide a way to fit the environment by rewiring the regulation of signal pathways. Furthermore, previous studies have found evidence that the functional potential of phosphorylation sites are increased with their evolutionary age, especially for Serine and Threonine, in disordered regions31.\nFinally, our observations of decreased ECSITCTER phosphorylation in response to A\u03b2 oligomers, coupled to a significantly enhanced NADH-dehydrogenase CI activity, further suggests that ECSIT plays a role as amolecular link betweenmitochondrial bioenergetics and early amyloid pathology (Fig. 6E). Although these results are preliminary andwarrant additional experimentation for a deeper understanding to determine how amyloids contribute to the functional activities of ECSIT, it seems that soluble A\u03b2 would somehow favour ECSIT\nACAD9 homodimer assembly of the ACAD9-ECSIT subcomplex\nsubstrate binding\nAcyl-CoA substrate ejection of FAD\nECSIT dephosphorylation of ECSIT\nbinding of ECSIT hairpin to ACAD9 opening of ACAD9 gatekeeper\nACAD9 active in FAO ACAD9 active in CI assembly\nFig. 7 | Proposed model of the mechanism of ACAD9-ECSIT assembly and its functional implications in FAO and OXPHOS pathways. In absence of ECSIT, ACAD9 acts as an acyl-CoA dehydrogenase enzyme in the first step of the FAO pathway. Dehydrogenation of the acyl-CoA substrate is concomitant with the reduction of the FAD prosthetic group into FADH2. Upon recognition of ACAD9 by\nECSIT, the gatekeeper loop in ACAD9 flips upwards, allowing the concomitant binding of ECSIT and deflavination, shutting down the dehydrogenase activity of ACAD9 and becoming committed to CI assembly. ECSIT dephosphorylation would enable the binding to ACAD9 and hence, act as a potential trigger to favour the assembly of the MCIA complex.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:8248 10\ndephosphorylation, apparently required for the initial recognition of MCIA partners. Interestingly, some studies show that soluble oligomeric A\u03b2 is sufficient to dramatically alter MAPK pathways before amyloid deposition32. A\u03b2 can even undergo phosphorylation that seem to exert increased toxicity in human neurons as compared to other known A\u03b2 species33. Therefore, ECSIT phosphorylation could either be directly regulated through downstream kinases or by the crosstalk with other signalling pathways. Under early amyloidogenic conditions, a stabilised MCIA complex would in turn contribute to a stabilised CI and thus, enhance its activity. Progressively, CI over-activity would lead to an NADH/NAD+ redox imbalance, generating oxidative stress and exacerbating the accumulation of A\u03b2 oligomers in a vicious cycle, which ultimately may result in the inhibition of CI activity, in agreement with previous studies3,21.\nIn summary, our study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms of ACAD9-ECSIT assembly and its functional implications in FAO and OXPHOS pathways, a process that may in turn be regulated by the phosphorylation of ECSIT (Fig. 7). Here, in the absence of ECSIT, ACAD9 acts as an acyl-CoA dehydrogenase enzyme in the first step of the FAO pathway. The recognition of aromatic residues on the ECSIT 320\u2013334 residue segment by the ACAD9 gatekeeper loop would induce its opening, enabling the deflavination of ACAD9 and the binding of ECSIT. This dual mechanism seems to be unique to ACAD9 by virtue of the flexible nature of its FAD binding site and the compactness of the 35 amino acid stretch at the base of the molecule. Our findings that ECSIT can be phosphorylated and that this has a negative effect on its affinity for ACAD9 imply that an ECSIT (de-)phosphorylation would be the trigger of ECSIT binding to ACAD9 and hence, a regulatory switch of the MCIA complex assembly. The observations that A\u03b2 soluble oligomers increase the activity of CI but also decrease ECSIT phosphorylation levels provide further evidence that ECSIT might be involved in AD pathogenesis11. By compromising both the assembly of CI and the regulation of FAO, ECSIT could act as a reprogrammer of OXPHOS and FAO pathways that may lead to altered metabolism in brain mitochondria and ultimately neurodegeneration12."

The ACAD9WT-ECSITCTER data set was the first to be acquired and processed. The first round of particle picking was performed automatically using the blob picker, resulting in ~2,200,000 picked particles. Particles were then extracted with a box size of 256 \u00d7 256 pixels and subjected to 2D classification, which immediately revealed very strongly predominant C2-symmetric top view orientation, similar to the situation encountered in our earlier work with a different ECSIT construct12. In total, ~1,600,000 particles corresponding to the best classes showing clear secondary structural features were selected for the generation of the first ab initio 3D volume which was then used as a reference for homogeneous refinement with applied C2 symmetry. Although the resulting 3D reconstruction had a nominal resolution of 3.07 \u00c5, it was clearly anisotropic due to the strong preferential top view orientation and the underrepresentation of the side and tilted views. Thus, projections of this reconstruction according to the directions of rare views were selected as templates for the next round of particle picking, leading to ~2,500,000pickedparticles. Thesewere extracted and subjected to 2D classification resulting in a more diverse set of classes. Seven classes (~115,000 particles, Supplementary Fig. 5A) representing the most different views of the molecule were used for a homogenous 3D refinement with the previous reconstruction as a reference and a C2 symmetry imposed, which yielded a map at 3.23 \u00c5. This improved but still visually somewhat elongated map was used to generate templates corresponding todifferent subsets of the rarest views for several further picking and 2D classification jobs performed in parallel. Particles corresponding to the rare views were combined, duplicate particles resulting from different picking jobs removed with a dedicated cryoSPARC routine, and classes representing the most different orientations carefully selected for a 3D refinement, resulting in a new 3D volume and leading to generation of new rare view templates. This procedure was iterated until no further improvement of the reconstructed 3D volume was detected. This 3D volume was then used as a reference for homogeneous 3D refinement of the corresponding\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:8248 12\n279,483 particles, followed by a non-uniform 3D refinement. This last refinement step resulted in a final 3Dmapwith an estimated resolution of 3.07 \u00c5 according to the Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC =0.143), whichwas thenpost-processed using a softmask and sharpenedwith a B-factor of \u2212171 \u00c52 for visualisation and model building (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Fig. 5B\u2013D).\nThe second acquired and processed data set, ACAD9WT, suffered from an apparently even more severe preferential orientation. Therefore, after numerous trials with the blob picker and the templates obtained from the resulting 2D class averages, we resolved to use the rare views of the final ACAD9WT-ECSITCTER map filtered to 30\u00c5 resolution for template picking. A total ~1,120,000 particles were picked in several parallel jobs and duplicates removed. The particles were extracted with a box size of 256 \u00d7 256 pixels and subjected to 2D classification. Homogenous 3D refinement with the low pass filtered ACAD9WT-ECSITCTER map as a reference and imposing the C2 symmetry was then performed on several different subsets of classes while carefully selecting rare views of reasonable quality. The best, although anisotropic, reconstruction that could be obtained by this approach included only 31,209 particles and had a nominal resolution of 3.91 \u00c5. These particles were then subjected to a 3D classification resulting in two classes containing 17,922 and 13,287 particles, and corresponding 3D maps with estimated average resolutions of 4.71 \u00c5 and 5.98 \u00c5, respectively. Visual assessment of these maps showed that the lower resolution map containing less particles was actually of higher quality and had a more isotropic resolution (Supplementary Fig. 5A, B, E, F). Homogeneous 3D refinement of this map showed a further improvement in its quality, leading to a final 3D reconstruction of ACAD9WT with an estimated average resolution of 4.5 \u00c5 (FSC = 0.143). Thismapwaspost-processed using a softmask and sharpened with a B-factor of \u2212180\u00c52.\nConsidering the difficulties encountered due to a very strongly preferred orientation of ACAD9WT, we opted for a recording of the ACAD9S191A data set at a 35 degrees stage tilt in order to increase the proportion of the rare views. As for ACAD9WT, the rare views of the low pass filtered ACAD9WT-ECSITCTER mapwere used for template picking. A total ~286,000 particles were picked, extracted with a box size of 256\u00d7 256 pixels and subjected to 2D classification. The best classes containing a total of ~149,000 particles were selected (Supplementary Fig. 5A) and subjected to a homogenous 3D refinement, using the low pass filtered ACAD9WT-ECSITCTERmap as a reference and imposing the C2 symmetry. The obtained volumehad a nominal resolution of 4.02 \u00c5 but, similarly to what we observed for the first map of ACAD9WTECSITCTER, clearly anisotropic. Addition of ~14,000 more particles corresponding to other classes resembling the rarer views and a subsequent 3D refinement resulted in a map of 3.92 \u00c5 resolution. A nonuniform 3D refinement of these ~163,000 particles gave a mapwith an estimated resolution of 3.63 \u00c5 (FSC =0.143). A dip in the FSC curve at ~6.5 \u00c5 was however still indicative of a remaining anisotropy (Supplementary Fig. 5B). In addition, a visual inspection of the map showed that some regions, in particular the \u03b2-sheets were not resolvable. However, side chain information could be identified in most \u03b1-helices. Further data processing with additional particles and changing parameters showed no improvement in the map quality (Supplementary Fig. 5G, H). Thus, this latest 3D reconstruction of ACAD9 S191A was manually sharpened with an input B factor of \u2212180 \u00c52 to allow better visualisation of the higher resolution features such as side chains and the orientation of the FAD cofactor.\nModel building and refinement Tobuild amodel of ACAD9WT-ECSITCTER, a homologymodel of ACAD9 dimer based on the human very long-chain Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD, PDB:3b96), wasused as the initial structure7. AF2models were not available at the time. In thismodel, eachACAD9protomer contains residues 38\u2013621 and binds one FAD molecule (a total of two FADs in\nthe ACAD9 dimer). The homologymodel was rigid-body fitted into the 3D reconstruction of ACAD9WT-ECSITCTER using ChimeraX 1.2\n37. A first round of real space refinement was conducted enabling rigid body, global minimisation, local grid search and atomic displacement parameter (ADP) refinement parameters; rotamer Ramachandran, noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) and reference model (VLCAD-based homologymodel) restraints were also imposed. The outputmodel was then manually corrected in Coot (v0.9.4.1)38 followed by iterative real space refinements with PHENIX (v1.18.2)39, using the same settings but removing the rigid body refinement parameter.\nRegions of the ACAD9dimermodel with no clearly corresponding cryo-EM density (454\u2013486, FAD) were removed from the final model. Upon model building, additional density that could not be attributed to ACAD9 was observed in a pocket adjacent to the ACAD9 dehydrogenase domain on each protomer. We tentatively attributed this density to ECSIT and manually inserted short polyalanine chains into each density using Coot (v0.9.4.1)38. Each chain was seen to adopt a short \u03b1-helix composed of 8\u201310 residues, sandwiched between two loops. A total of 15 Alanine residues could be fitted into the visible density. Due to the high resolution of the cryo-EMmap in this region, it was possible to identify characteristics of several aromatic side chains, in particular a Phenylalanine and two neighbouring Tyrosine residues, indicating a sequence WXYY where X represented an unidentified residue.Comparisonwith the sequenceof the ECSIT construct enabled us to detect a short amino acid sequence, totalling 15 amino acids corresponding to residues 320\u2013334,with aromatic side chainpositions matching those observed in the ACAD9WT-ECSITCTER cryo-EM map. The sequence was thenmutated in Coot (v0.9.4.1)38 in agreement with the identified ECSIT sequence. The final ACAD9WT-ECSITCTER model was validated using the comprehensive validation tool in PHENIX (v1.18.2)39 (Supplementary Fig. 4A).\nConsidering that the final cryo-EM map of ACAD9WT was at 4.5 \u00c5 resolution and showed high levels of anisotropy, no attempts were made to build an atomic model of ACAD9WT in the absence of ECSIT. Thus, a simple rigid body fit of the ACAD9WT-ECSITCTERmodel and the AF2 ACAD9 model (res. 38\u2013621) was performed in ChimeraX 1.237 (Supplementary Fig. 4B). Model building into the ACAD9S191A cryo-EMmapwas done using both the VLCAD-based ACAD9 homology model and the final ACAD9WT-ECSITCTERmodels in parallel. Rigid body fitting in ChimeraX 1.2 revealed that the ACAD9WT-ECSITCTER model fitted better into the ACAD9S191A cryo-EM map than the VLCAD-based ACAD9 homology model. Therefore, the ACAD9WT-ECSITCTERmodel was used for further structure refinement. As demonstrated in our earlier work12, the FAD is not present in the ACAD9WT-ECSITCTER cryo-EMmap. Therefore, in the resulting atomic model, the coordinates of the FAD molecules were taken from the aligned PDB of the homology model. Similarly to ACAD9WT-ECSITCTER, the ACAD9S191A cryo-EM map does not display density for the flexible helices located next to the vestigial domain of ACAD9 (residues 454\u2013485). As a result, these were removed from the model. Real space refinement of secondary structural features as well as side chains was iteratively conducted in Coot (v0.9.4.1) followed by rigid body refinement using PHENIX (v1.18.2)39. The final ACAD9S191A model was also validated using the comprehensive validation tool in PHENIX (v1.18.2)39 (Supplementary Fig. 4C). A summary of refinement andmodel validation statistics can be found in Supplementary Table 1. Visualisation of structures and diagrams to analyse ACAD9, ECSIT and FAD interactions were done with ChimeraX 1.237, PyMOL v4.6040 and LigPlot+ v.2.2.841."

The structures were aligned and RMSD values generated using ChimeraX 1.237.\nAlphaFold modelling of the ACAD9-ECSIT subcomplex was conducted using ColabFold (v1.3.0) prediction tools42. The protein sequences for ACAD9 (human) and ECSIT (human) were taken from UniPROT43 and modified to match the constructs used in our experiments: ACAD9 contained residues 38\u2013621 and ECSIT contained residues 221\u2013431. Structure prediction of the ACAD9-ECSIT subcomplex wasperformedusing twoACAD9 sequences and two ECSIT sequences, based on information obtained from our experimental results.\nWe took the best predictedmodel from the five proposedmodels for our analysis. The Predicted Aligned Error (PAE) plot generated alongside the docked model showed low values (<15), representing well defined relative positions and orientations (Supplementary Fig. 6A), for the majority of the residues in the ACAD9 dimer, the exception being for residues 455-486 which have high PAE values (~30). Overall PAE values for ECSIT are high, however lower values are shown for the residues corresponding to those modelled in the ACAD9WT-ECSITCTER model, where the PAE value is low. Additionally, alignment of the ECSIT residues built based on the cryo-EM map with the calculated model shows a very high agreement (RMSD of 1.045 \u00c5) (Supplementary Fig. 6C), providing further support to our experimental results. Supplementary Fig. 6 describing the AF results was generated using ChimeraX 1.237."
