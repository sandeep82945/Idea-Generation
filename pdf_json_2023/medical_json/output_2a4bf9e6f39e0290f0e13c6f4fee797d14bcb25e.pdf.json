    "abstractText": "The flourishing field of soft robotics requires versatile actuationmethodology. Natural vibration is a physical phenomenon that can occur in any material. Here, we report high-speed bending of anisole crystals by natural vibration induced by the photothermal effect. Rod-shaped crystal cantilevers undergo small, fast repetitive bending (~0.2\u00b0) due to natural vibration accompanied by large photothermal bending (~1\u00b0) under ultraviolet light irradiation. The natural vibration is greatly amplified by resonance upon pulsed light irradiation at the natural frequency to realise high frequency (~700Hz), large bending (~4\u00b0), and high energy conversion efficiency from light to mechanical energy. The natural vibration is induced by the thermal load generated by the temperature gradient in the crystal due to the photothermal effect. The bending behaviour is successfully simulated using finite element analysis. Any light-absorbing crystal can be actuated by photothermally induced natural vibration. This findingof versatile crystal actuation can lead to thedevelopment of soft robots with high-speed and high-efficient actuation capabilities.",

Natural vibration is a physical phenomenon that can occur in any material. Here, we report high-speed bending of anisole crystals by natural vibration induced by the photothermal effect. Rod-shaped crystal cantilevers undergo small, fast repetitive bending (~0.2\u00b0) due to natural vibration accompanied by large photothermal bending (~1\u00b0) under ultraviolet light irradiation. The natural vibration is greatly amplified by resonance upon pulsed light irradiation at the natural frequency to realise high frequency (~700Hz), large bending (~4\u00b0), and high energy conversion efficiency from light to mechanical energy. The natural vibration is induced by the thermal load generated by the temperature gradient in the crystal due to the photothermal effect. The bending behaviour is successfully simulated using finite element analysis. Any light-absorbing crystal can be actuated by photothermally induced natural vibration. This findingof versatile crystal actuation can lead to thedevelopment of soft robots with high-speed and high-efficient actuation capabilities.\nNatural vibration is a physical phenomenon during which a material continues to vibrate at a certain frequency (the natural frequency) upon the application of an external force. Additionally, when a periodic force is applied near the natural frequency, the vibrationalmotion is amplified by resonance. For example, during an earthquake, if the natural frequency of a shaking building matches the frequency of the earthquake, the building will resonate and shake violently, which may lead to collapse of the structure1. Equipment and devices must be designed so that resonance does not occur, otherwise they may be damaged or become less durable2. Most musical instruments, such as the guitar and saxophone, create sound (natural vibration) via the movement of strings or reeds and amplify the sound via resonance in a box or tube3. Thus, resonated natural vibrations are widely related to our daily life. However, the natural vibration has not been paid attention in terms of material actuation. We have focused on crystal actuation because mechanically responsive molecular crystals have potential application in actuators and soft robots4. Over the past decade, many mechanically responsive crystals have been developed that display bending5\u20137, twisting8, jumping9 and flagella-like motion10. Most of these motions have been induced via photoisomerisation. Phase transitions can also induce mechanical motions, such as expansion/contraction11, bending12, jumping13 and locomotion14. Mechanical motion of molecular crystals have been reviewed in several publications15\u201319. However, photoisomerisation and phase transitions are not versatile due to the limitation that they can only occur in certain crystals. Furthermore, photoisomerisation-induced motion tends to be slow and thick crystals do not actuate19. Recently, we reported high-speed photothermally driven crystal bending20\u201323. The photothermal effect is a phenomenon by which\nReceived: 13 September 2022\nAccepted: 2 March 2023\nCheck for updates\n1Graduate School of Advanced Science and Engineering, Waseda University, 3-4-1 Okubo, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 169\u20138555, Japan. 2School of Materials and Chemical Technology, Tokyo Institute of Technology, 2-12-1 Ookayama, Meguro-ku, Tokyo 152-8550, Japan. 3Research Organization for Nano & Life Innovation, Waseda University, 513 Wasedatsurumaki-cho, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 162-0041, Japan. e-mail: h.koshima@kurenai.waseda.jp\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:1354 1\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\nthermal energy (heat) is produced by the nonradiative deactivation of photoexcited materials; it occurs in any light-absorbing crystal. However, photothermally driven bending is small, with a bending angle typically less than 0.5\u00b0. One strategy to enhance photothermal bending is to focus on crystals with a large thermal expansion coefficient. Hence\u03b2-phase crystal (1\u03b2)24 of 2,4-dinitroanisole (1) (Fig. 1a), which has relatively large thermal expansion coefficient, was used in this study.\nWhile observing the bending of 1\u03b2 crystals due to the photothermal effect upon ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation, we have unexpectedly discovered for the first time that small, fast natural vibration occurs while accompanied by a large photothermal bending. More surprisingly, when irradiated with a pulsed UV laser of the same frequency as the natural frequency, the bending angle due to the natural vibration is considerably amplified by resonance, achieving highspeed, large bending, and high energy conversion efficiency from light to mechanical energy. Simulation of this high-speed bending is also successful. Resonated natural vibrations can expand the potential and versatility of crystals as actuation materials."

X-ray crystallographic analysis at 20 \u00b0C further confirmed that the rod-shaped crystal belonged to the monoclinic crystal system and the space group P21/n (Supplementary\nTable 1, Supplementary Fig. 1, and Supplementary Data 1), consistent with the reported \u03b2-phase structure24. The 1\u03b2 molecules were aligned in a herringbone motif along the b-axis due to the two-fold helical axis and \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking of 3.588 \u00c5 along the a-axis on the (001) plane (Fig. 1d). This resulted in the formation of the (010) plane as the top face and the longitudinal direction along the a-axis (Fig. 1c). The temperature dependence of the lattice constants indicated that the aaxis length increased linearly from 3.972 \u00c5 at 10 \u00b0C to 4.021 \u00c5 at 60 \u00b0C; the thermal expansion coefficient of the longitudinal direction along the a-axis was calculated as 247MK\u22121 (Fig. 1e, Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 2), which is several times larger than that (average value: 71.4 MK\u22121) of many molecular crystals25.\nThe ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) diffuse reflectance spectrum of powdered 1\u03b2 crystals measured at room temperature showed strong absorption in the UV region, with an absorption peak at 370 nm and a shoulder at 450 nm (Fig. 1f).\nNatural vibration induced by the photothermal effect When a hexagonal rod-shaped 1\u03b2 crystal (length 6075 \u03bcm, width 151 \u03bcm, width of the top face 40 \u03bcm, thickness 105 \u03bcm; crystal III in Supplementary Table 5) fixed at one endwas uniformly irradiated from the top with the UV laser (375 nm, 1456mWcm\u22122) (Fig. 2a), the crystal was significantly bent due to the photothermal effect. Surprisingly, smaller and faster repetitive bending accompanied this large photothermal bending both under UV irradiation and after irradiation ceased (Fig. 2d and SupplementaryMovie 1). Note that the crystal tip did notmoveout of focus during deformation, confirming that the crystal bent in the sameplane anddidnot bend out of plane (Fig. 2a). In this study, crystal bending was evaluated using the bending angle, defined as the difference in tip displacement between the two most offset positions (Fig. 2c).\nUpon UV irradiation, the photothermally driven bending away from the light source quickly reached a bending angle of 0.85\u00b0 in 9.4ms, then gradually increased to 1.22\u00b0 in 100ms (Fig. 2a, d). This bending angle is greater than the 0.2\u00b0\u20130.5\u00b0 previously reported for other crystals20\u201323 due to the larger thermal expansion coefficient (247 MK\u22121) of the 1\u03b2 crystal compared with those (80\u2013130 MK\u22121) reported for other crystals. After stopping the UV exposure at 100ms, the crystal bent up quickly to 0.32\u00b0 in 17ms, then slowly returned to 0.23\u00b0 in 100ms (Fig. 2a, d). The photothermally driven bending data were fitted with an exponential curve (Fig. 2e), giving time constants (\u03c4on, \u03c4off) of 4.7 and 6.4ms for UV light on and off conditions, respectively. The surface temperature, which was simultaneouslymonitored by an infrared (IR) camera, increased from 25.6 \u00b0C to 35.3 \u00b0C upon 100ms of UV irradiation (Fig. 2b) and decreased to 33.1 \u00b0C in 100ms after the UV irradiation was stopped (red curve in Fig. 2d). The maximum bending angle and the maximum surface temperature increased linearly with increasing UV intensity (Fig. 2h, Supplementary Fig. 8 and Supplementary Table 4).\nThe smaller, faster repetitive bending was extracted by fitting the photothermal bending curve (Fig. 2e) to provide the vibration-like bending profile (Fig. 2f). The small bending angle was ~0.20\u00b0 initially, then gradually decreased to a steady angle of 0.02\u00b0 at 80ms.When the UV irradiation was stopped, the bending angle immediately recovered to 0.18\u00b0, then attenuated to a steady 0.04\u00b0 in 20ms. Fourier transform analyses of the time profile of bending with and without UV irradiation revealed that the frequencies of the small vibration-like bending were both 390Hz (Fig. 2g). The bending angle of the small vibration increased linearly with increasing UV intensity. In contrast, the frequency did not change and remained at 390Hz for any UV laser intensity. This confirmed that the small vibration-like bending was the natural vibration (Fig. 2i, Supplementary Fig. 8 and Supplementary\nTable 4).\nspectrum of powdered 1\u03b2 crystals.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:1354 2\nFor a hexagonal rod-shaped 1\u03b2 crystal, the natural frequency fcal can be calculated according to Eq.

The calculated natural frequency fcal of 397Hzwas in close agreementwith themeasured value (390Hz).\nResonance amplification of a natural vibration As mentioned above, the bending angle of the natural vibration was oneorder ofmagnitude smaller than that of the photothermally driven bending. Surprisingly, however, when crystal III was irradiated with pulsed UV light at the natural frequency of 390Hz, the natural vibration was dramatically amplified by resonance (Fig. 3a, b and Supplementary Movie 2). The bending angle began at 0.20\u00b0 in the first cycle and increased with irradiation time to the maximum of 3.4\u00b0 after 150ms; the difference in angle between the maximum of 2.4\u00b0 and the minimumof\u22121.0\u00b0 represented a 17-fold resonance amplification. Then, the resonated bending angle gradually decreased as the surface temperature increased. When the surface temperature reached a constant 40.8 \u00b0C after 850ms under pulsed UV light, the resonated bending angle reached a steady value of 2.3\u00b0 and maintained the angle with a quite small standard error of 0.003\u00b0 during 850\u20131190ms (133 cycles). Once the UV irradiation was stopped at 1190ms, the bending angle rapidly decreased and the natural vibration almost disappeared within 200ms. This resonated bending was observed for at least 460 cycles without any fatigue of the crystal under pulsed UV irradiation.\nTo determine the exact natural frequency of crystal III, we observed the bending behaviourwhile irradiating it with UVpulses of a wide range of frequencies; the natural frequency (the most amplified frequency) was 390Hz (black open circle, Fig. 3c). In addition, the fitted natural frequency ffit determined by the forced vibration model (see the footnote in Supplementary Table 5) was also 390Hz (red open circle, Fig. 3c).\nFurthermore, bending amplification due to resonance was examined in detail using another crystal V with a higher natural frequency of 702Hz (Supplementary Fig. 9 and Supplementary Table 5). The resonated bending angle increased linearly with intensity of the 702Hz pulsed UV light (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 10). Interestingly, when UV light pulsed over a wide range of 5\u20131000Hz was used, bending amplification by resonance was observed not only at the 702Hz natural frequency f but also at its odd fractions of 233 (f /3), 139 (f /5), 99 (f /7), 77 (f /9), 63 (f /11) and 53 (f /13) Hz (Fig. 3e), and various bending patterns were created (Fig. 3g\u2013i and Supplementary Fig. 11).\nThis amplificationwas causedby the start ofdown-bendingandupbending due to the natural vibration at the same timewhen theUV light was turned on and off, respectively. To evaluate separately the photothermally driven bending and the natural vibration induced by pulsed UV irradiation of odd fractions of the natural frequency, the bending angle of the natural vibration was extracted by fitting the photothermally driven bending angle by the pulse frequency (Supplementary\nFig. 12). The fitted line described a linear increase in bending angle of the natural vibration with increasing pulse frequency (blue, Fig. 3f). On the other hand, the photothermally driven bending angle decreased nonlinearly with increasing pulse frequency (red, Fig. 3f)."

When the crystals were continuously irradiated with UV light for 100ms, they exhibited photothermally driven bending of 1.1\u00b0\u20131.7\u00b0, which increased slightly in proportion to the thickness (Fig. 4a). The natural vibrations of 0.06\u00b0\u20130.3\u00b0 were extracted and were greatly amplified to 1.9\u00b0\u20134.0\u00b0 due to resonance upon irradiation with pulsed UV light at each natural frequency; these were nearly proportional to the aspect ratio (length/thickness) of the crystals (Fig. 4b, c). The\nnatural frequencies were in the range of 200\u2013700Hz and were nearly proportional to thickness/length2 (h/l 2), in accordance with Eq. (1) (Fig. 4d). Moreover, the resonance amplification ratio ranging from 9 to 32 also increased in proportion to the thickness/length2 (Fig. 4e). Summarising, the frequency and the bending angle could be changed and tuned by changing the crystal shape; larger bending could be realised by resonating thinner and longer crystals, and conversely, the higher natural frequency could be realised byusing thicker and shorter crystals (Fig. 4f).

The tip deflection speed vl of the resonated natural vibration was in the range of 0.2\u20130.6m s\u22121 (black solid circle), which was more than ten times faster than the 0.01\u20130.03m s\u22121 (black open circle) of the non-resonated natural vibration. The tip deflection speed (0.001 \u2013 0.05m s\u20131) by the photothermal effect itself of the 1\u03b2 crystal (red circle) and other crystals (red triangle21, square22, and rhombus23) is slightly slower to comparable to thatof thenon-resonant vibration, but still fast because the photothermal effect takes place at the picosecond lavel21, 22 in the primary photophysical process. On the other hand, the tip deflection speed by photoisomerisation (blue triangle21, square22, and rhombus23) is slow (0.0001 \u2013 0.001m s\u20131) because photoisomerisation takes place at the nanosecond lavel21, 22 in the secondary photochemical process. To the best of our knowledge,\nthe bending speed of the resonated natural vibration reported herein is the fastest of reported mechanically responsive crystals. The larger Young\u2019s modulus of the 1\u03b2 crystal than those of polymers and gels realised the high natural frequency (700Hz), contributing the fast tip deflection speed.\nThe energy conversion efficiency \u03b7 from incident light energy UL to mechanical energy UM was evaluated according to Eq.

On the other hand, the natural vibration is caused by the thermal load in the crystal generated by the photothermal effect. Despite these different bending mechanisms, we attempted to simulate actual bending behaviour by combining both photothermally driven bending and natural vibration.\nFigure 5a presents a schematic illustration of the geometrical parameters of a hexagonal crystal cantilever for photothermally driven bending and natural vibration. Upon photoirradiation, heat is generated at the irradiated surface by the photothermal effect, conducting into the thickness direction according to the non-steady heat conduction equation, Eq. (3):21\n\u2202T y, t\u00f0 \u00de \u2202t =\u03b1 \u22022T \u2202y2 \u00f03\u00de\nwhere \u03b1 is the thermal diffusivity (1.34 \u00d7 10\u22127 m2 s\u22121, Supplementary Fig. 4) along the thickness direction, y is the displacement in the thickness direction, t is timeandT( y, t) is the temperature at a certain y and t. Consequently, the temperature gradient and the thermal load are generated and trigger the photothermal bending and the natural vibration, respectively.\nIn the elastic cantilever system, thephotothermalbending and the natural vibration are explicitly included in Eq. (4):27\nF x, t\u00f0 \u00de=\u03c1A \u22022\u03b4 x, t\u00f0 \u00de \u2202t2 + EI \u2202 4\u03b4 x, t\u00f0 \u00de \u2202x4\n\u00f04\u00de\nwhere A is the cross-sectional area, x is the displacement along the lengthdirection, \u03b4 (x, t) is thedeflection at a certain x and t and F (x, t) is the applied thermal load at a certain x and t derived from the temperature gradient. Using the tip deflection \u03b4 (l, t) calculated according to Eq. (4), the combined bending angle \u03b8 of the photothermal bending and the natural vibration can be calculated using Eq. (5):\n\u03b8 t\u00f0 \u00de= \u03b4 l, t\u00f0 \u00del \u00f05\u00de\nWe simulated the bending angle by finite element analysis (FEA) using the ANSYS software package28. The temperature gradient was calculated by non-steady heat conduction analysis, and then the actual bending was simulated by coupled thermo-structural analysis (Supplementary 6 and Supplementary Fig. 13).\nWe conducted two types of simulations as described below.\nSimulation I The bending simulation of crystal III was conducted based on the surface temperature changes measured by infrared (IR) thermography. The measured temperature was applied to the top surface, while the temperatures of two upper slanting surfaces were set according to the fitted temperature distribution (Supplementary 6.1 and Supplementary Fig. 14). According to Eq. (3), the temperature gradient was formed in the thickness direction and the temperatures of the irradiated and the back surfaces after UV irradiation for 100ms were calculated to be 35.8 \u00b0C and 32.6 \u00b0C, respectively (Fig. 5b, c), giving a temperature difference of 3.2 \u00b0C (Fig. 5d).\nCoupled thermo-structural analysis was then performed based on the calculated temperature gradient. Due to the one-directional temperature gradient in the thickness direction (Fig. 5b), the bending deformation was also confirmed to be in the vertical direction. The bending angle and time constant of the photothermal bending were well simulated to be 1.26\u00b0 and 4.2ms, respectively, which are comparable to the 1.22\u00b0 and 4.7ms of the measured bending (Fig. 5e and Supplementary Movie 3). The 390Hz non-resonated natural vibration was also successfully simulated.\nNext, the resonated natural vibration under 390Hz pulsed UV irradiation was simulated. First, the time dependence of the temperature difference between the irradiated and back surfaces was calculated (Fig. 5f). Coupled thermo-structural analysis was then performed; the calculated time profile of amplified bending angle was nearly coincident with the measured one (Fig. 5g and Supplementary Movie 4).\nSimulation II The bending simulation of crystal III, based on the irradiated light energy, was also performed, without the surface temperature measurement.When theupper surface of the crystalwas irradiatedwithUV light (375 nm, 1456mWcm\u22122), almost all of the irradiated light energy should have been absorbed by the crystal because this 1\u03b2 crystal emitted very weak fluorescence (quantum yield: 0.005) (Supplementary Fig. 6). The specific heat capacity (1.53 J g\u22121 K\u22121, Supplementary Fig. 5) was used to translate heat energy to temperature. Simulation II is detailed in Supplementary 6.2 and Supplementary Fig. 15. The simulated and measured time profiles for bending under UV irradiation for 100mswere comparable (Fig. 5h and SupplementaryMovie 5). Furthermore, the simulated profile of amplified, repeated bending under 390Hz pulsed UV irradiation was completely coincident with the measured profile (Fig. 5i and Supplementary Movie 6). Thus, the bending simulation II based on the irradiated light energy was successful, even without using the measured temperature as in Simulation I.\nWe have successfully simulated photothermal-induced natural vibration based on FEA as shown in Simulation I and II. In the past decade, a few models have been proposed to reproduce photomechanical bending of crystals throughphotoisomerisation\u2014chemical reactions of molecules\u2014based on rigorous mathematical equations29, 30. The aim of thesemathematical models is to understand the photoreaction of molecules in the crystalline state from the perspective of solid-state photochemistry. On the other hand, one of the objectives of this study is to reproduce high-speed bending of crystals through the photothermal effect and natural vibration\u2014fundamental physical phenomena\u2014and elucidate the mechanism of high-speed bending based on FEA models. Such FEA models are expected to enable a deeper understanding ofmechanicalmotions of crystals from the viewpoint of not only materials chemistry but also materials engineering.\nIn conclusion, we discovered that molecular crystals cause highspeed natural vibration by the photothermal effect. The natural vibration was dramatically amplified by resonance to achieve highspeed, large bending, and high energy conversion efficiency. Any lightabsorbing crystal can be actuated by photothermally induced natural vibration. This versatile and fast crystal actuation is expected to contribute to the development of soft robotics with high-speed and highefficient actuation capabilities."

Enthalpy changes during thermal phase transitions were determined during heating and subsequent cooling between \u221250 \u00b0C and 120 \u00b0C. The same instrument was used to measure the specific heat capacity during heating.\nSingle-crystal X-ray diffraction data of crystals of 1\u03b2 at 20 \u00b0C were collected using an R-AXIS RAPID diffractometer (Rigaku) equipped with a monochromatic Mo-K\u03b1 radiation source (\u03bb = 0.71069\u00c5) operating at 50 kV and 40mA. The temperature of the sample was regulated using a nitrogen gas flow cryostat. The crystal structure was solved using the integrated space group and crystal structure determination algorithm of SHELXT31 software and refined on F2 using the full-matrix least-squares SHELXL method32. The calculation was performed using the Olex2 molecular graphical interface33. Face indices and unit cell constants over the temperature range of 10\u221260 \u00b0C were measured using the same equipment.\nUV-vis diffuse reflectance spectrum of powdered 1\u03b2 crystals was measured using a spectrophotometer (Lambda 650; PerkinElmer) equipped with an integrating sphere. The powder was mounted on a glass plate and then covered with a quartz plate. The experiment was performed over the wavelength range of 200\u2013800nm at 1 nm resolution, using a scan speed of 266.75 nmmin\u22121.\nFluorescence spectrum (\u03bbex = 300 nm) of powdered 1\u03b2 crystals was measured using a spectrofluorometer (FP-6500; JASCO). The fluorescence quantum yield (\u03bbex = 375 nm) of the 1\u03b2 single crystals was determined with an absolute photoluminescence quantum yield spectrometer (C9920-02G; Hamamatsu Photonics).\nThermal diffusivity of the 1\u03b2 single crystal was measured by the TWA technique34 along the thickness direction (b-axis) at room temperature (25 \u00b0C). A single crystal was positioned between an indium \u2212tin oxide glass heater and a nickel\u2013gold microthermocouple sensor. The thermal diffusivity was calculated based on the relationship between the phase delay of the temperaturewaves between the heater and the sensor, and the frequency of the temperature wave.\nYoung\u2019s modulus of the 1\u03b2 crystal wasmeasured using a universal testing machine (RTG-1210; A&D). The displacement dependence of applied load was measured by cantilever bending test."

The entire rod-shaped crystal was irradiated using a UV laser (\u03bb = 375 nm; FOLS-03; SAWAKI Kobo) equipped with a fiber line generator (FLG10FC-633; Thorlabs). The surface temperature distribution was recorded using an IR thermography system (FSV-2000; Apiste). After collecting thermography images, the emissivity of a 1\u03b2 crystal was modified by applying a black-body coating (emissivity: 0.96; TA410KS; TASKO) to the rod-shaped crystal and the surface temperature was calibrated using the modified crystal emissivity of 0.95. The bending motion and surface temperature distribution were recorded at 8,000 and 120 fps, respectively. VariousUVpulse frequencieswere generated as square waves (duty ratio: 50%) via transistor-transistor logic control of the UV laser by an Arduino Leonard microcomputer device. The bending angle of the crystal was automatically analysed using Tracker, a video analysis and modelling tool35."
