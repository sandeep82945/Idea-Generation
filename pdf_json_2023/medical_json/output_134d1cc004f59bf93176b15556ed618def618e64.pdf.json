It is characterized by a cross-talk of proinflammatory cells across the blood\u2013brain barrier, by microglial activation and leukocyte migration, but not by the entry of infecting organisms into the brain tissue. Septic encephalopathy is very frequent in older persons because of their limited cognitive reserve. The predominant clinical manifestation is delirium, whereas focal neurological signs and symptoms are absent. Electroencephalography is a very sensitive method to detect functional abnormalities, but these abnormalities are not specific for septic encephalopathy and of limited prognostic value. Routine cerebral imaging by computer tomography usually fails to visualize the subtle abnormalities produced by septic involvement of the brain. Magnetic resonance imaging is by far more sensitive to detect vasogenic edema, diffuse axonal injury or small ischemic lesions. Routine laboratory parameters most suitable to monitor sepsis, but not specific for septic encephalopathy, are C-reactive protein and procalcitonin. The additional measurement of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 increases the accuracy to predict delirium and an unfavorable outcome. The most promising laboratory parameters to quantify neuronal and axonal injury caused by septic encephalopathy are neurofilament light chains (NfL) and S100B protein. Neuron-specific enolase (NSE) plasma concentrations are strongly influenced by hemolysis. We\u00a0propose to determine NSE only in non-hemolytic plasma or serum samples for the estimation of outcome in septic encephalopathy.\nKEYWORDS\nsepsis, plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, magnetic resonance tomography, positron emission tomography, electroencephalography, neurofilament light chains, S100B protein\n1. Introduction\nThe brain can be\u00a0affected by many different types of infections with differing degrees of severity. The mildest situation is acute sickness behavior induced by a short inflammatory burst in the systemic circulation communicated to the brain via (a) leaky regions of the blood\u2013brain barrier in the circumventricular organs, (b) afferent fibers of the vagus nerve, and (c) direct communication across the blood\u2013brain barrier leading to a short-term reduction of cognitive function without long-term sequelae (Perry et\u00a0al., 2003; Tauber et\u00a0al., 2021; Too et\u00a0al., 2021; Zumofen et\u00a0al., 2023).

In contrast, the most severe end of the spectrum of involvement of the brain in infection is when the pathogen has entered the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or/and the brain. This is the case in bacterial or fungal meningitis, viral encephalitis and different forms of intracranial abscesses. In addition to pro-inflammatory mediators, microbes and components released by them, in particular hemolysins and free radicals, can target neurons, and their products can directly stimulate immune cells in the brain or are toxic to different cell types present in nervous tissue (Nau and Br\u00fcck, 2002; Too et\u00a0al., 2021).\nSeptic encephalopathy is a disease entity between these two extremes: circulating immune cells and mediators of inflammation communicate with the brain via the circumventricular organs, afferent fibers of the vagus nerve and the endothelium of the vessels in brain parenchyma, meninges and choroid plexus. The entry of bacterial products through leaks of the blood\u2013brain barrier plays a minor role, and the pathogen itself does not enter the brain parenchyma or the CSF (Perry et\u00a0 al., 2003; Figure\u00a0 1). Whereas the incidence of community-acquired meningitis has decreased substantially in industrialized countries over the past 50 years, the incidence of septic encephalopathy has risen due to increased numbers of susceptible persons, particularly those over the age of 50 years. The susceptibility of the brain to septic encephalopathy (or sepsis-associated encephalopathy) is age-dependent. It is high in newborns, infants and toddlers, then decreases in older children and is very low in young adults. Beyond the age of 50 years, it gradually increases due to aging of the immune system, concomitantly administered medications and co-morbidities, and a physiological age-related decline in the functional capacity of most organs (Werner and Kuntsche, 2000; Lu\net\u00a0 al., 2022). For these reasons the incidence of sepsis in persons beyond 70 years is approximately 100 times higher than in young adults (Angus et\u00a0al., 2001). Septic encephalopathy that manifests as delirium, stupor or coma has become a common problem in geriatric medicine. Whether it develops in an older person depends on the severity of the infectious challenge and the cognitive reserve, or cognitive resilience, of the individual (Cizginer et\u00a0al., 2017; Figure\u00a02). In the pathophysiology of septic encephalopathy in advanced age, the stimulation of microglial cells that are pre-activated by amyloid-\u03b2, \u03b1-synuclein and other endogenous compounds deposited in the brain during neurodegenerative diseases, and to an extent also during healthy aging, also play a key role (Perry et\u00a0al., 2003).\nSeptic encephalopathy is the prototype of an organic psychosis. In contrast to septic embolic or metastatic encephalitis, where focal neurological deficits are present and often determine the clinical picture (Tauber et\u00a0 al., 2017, 2021; Figure\u00a0 3), the main clinical manifestation of moderate septic encephalopathy is delirium, and of severe encephalopathy stupor or coma. In a large retrospective study comprising 2,513 patients with sepsis at ICU admission, potentially modifiable factors contributing to septic encephalopathy were acute renal failure, hypo- and hyperglycemia, hypercapnia and hypernatremia (Sonneville et\u00a0al., 2017). One of the most delightful outcomes for a clinical geriatrician is the rapid recovery of some patients after appropriate antimicrobial treatment and fluid and electrolyte management. Unfortunately, after septic encephalopathy many persons do not reach their pre-infection cognitive level. Animal studies suggest a time-dependent recovery from anxiety and depression (Dal-Pizzol et\u00a0al., 2021), whereas cognitive impairment apparently persists (Savi et\u00a0al., 2021). Patients surviving septic encephalopathy have a higher risk\nFIGURE\u00a01 Conceptual relation between infection and cognition. During an acute, mild viral infection such as influenza, acute sickness behavior manifests as malaise, mild hypoxia, headache, and lost productivity (Zumofen et\u00a0al., 2023) as a consequence of acute sickness behavior caused by a short systemic inflammatory reaction. Antiviral therapy usually is not indicated. On the other end of the spectrum when there is microbial invasion of the brain, e.g. in bacterial meningitis, pathogens and bacterial products are present in the cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue causing direct and immune-mediated neuronal damage (Nau and Br\u00fcck, 2002; Too et\u00a0al., 2021). In septic encephalopathy, bacteria do not enter the brain, and neuronal injury predominantly is not caused directly by bacterial products, but by cross-talk of immune cells across the blood\u2013brain barrier leading to microglial activation and entry of immune cells into the brain. In septic encephalitis, pathogens in low quantities enter the brain, either causing microabscesses (septic-metastatic form) or vasculitis and cerebral ischemia by infected emboli (septic-embolic form).\nFrontiers in Cellular Neuroscience 03 frontiersin.org\nof developing a neurodegenerative disease than persons without sepsis or, when a neurodegenerative disease already is present, experience an acute exacerbation or acceleration of their disease (Perry et\u00a0al., 2003). Similarly, recent studies indicate that adults who survive a variety of infections severe enough to require hospitalization have a significantly increased risk of developing dementia over the next 10\u201320 years (Sipil\u00e4 et\u00a0al., 2021; Bohn et\u00a0al., 2023). Severe sepsis in the elderly approximately triples the risk of the development of moderate to strong new cognitive impairment in this population (Peters van Ton et\u00a0al., 2022; Piva et\u00a0al., 2023). These findings in humans are recapitulated in a mouse model of intraperitoneal infection with Listeria monocytogenes followed by amoxicillin treatment (Cassidy et\u00a0al., 2023). Here, systemic infections by neuroinvasive wild-type bacteria, as well as by non-neuroinvasive \u2206hly mutants induced cognitive impairment manifest 4 months after infection. Similar to findings in patients (Sipil\u00e4 et\u00a0al., 2021), cognitive\ndeficits were more profound after infection with neuroinvasive L. monocytogenes, and correlated significantly with the retention of CD8+ T-lymphocytes in the brain. The presence of cognitive decline after non-neuroinvasive infection, which did not lead to retained white blood cells in the brain, suggests that neuroinvasive and non-neuroinvasive infections may trigger cognitive decline via different mechanisms (Cassidy et\u00a0 al., 2023). In addition to CD8+ T-cell instigated neuroinflammation, another possible source of injury is through alterations in endothelial function. For example, the momentto-moment adjustment of cerebral blood flow to match the increased demands of active brain regions, known as neurovascular coupling, was impaired in a geriatric L. monocytogenes sepsis model prior to the development of cognitive impairment (Csipo et\u00a0al., 2021).\nDelirium is defined as \u201ca disturbance in attention (i.e., reduced ability to direct, focus, sustain, and shift attention) accompanied by reduced awareness of the environment\u201d (American Society for Psychiatry, 2022). It has a range of severities and typically presents with fluctuating symptoms. Therefore, repeated clinical assessments are necessary to quantify its severity. Two widely applied rapid methods are the general ward confusion assessment method (CAM) and the confusion assessment method in the intensive care unit (CAM-ICU). Usually measurements are performed 3 times daily in order to assess the mental status of patients at risk for, or already suffering from delirium. CAM (applied on general wards) and CAM-ICU (applied on intensive care wards) in several studies showed a high sensitivity and specificity (CAM: 94\u2013100%, 89\u201395%; CAM-ICU: 97\u2013100%, 89\u2013100%) (data summarized by Yuechen et\u00a0al., 2023). The severity of delirium also can be\u00a0estimated by scales, e.g. the CAM-S (Khan et\u00a0al., 2017).\nUnlike septic-embolic or -metastatic encephalitis, which can be\u00a0 visualized by cranial computer tomography (CCT) or \u2013 more sensitive and specific, but less suitable in agitated geriatric patients\u00a0cranial magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) without and with contrast enhancement (Tauber et\u00a0al., 2017, 2021), septic encephalopathy often cannot be\u00a0detected or visualized by routine imaging with CCT or cMRI. Therefore, the clinician is confronted with the problem to substantiate the diagnosis \u201cseptic encephalopathy\u201d in order not to overlook other diagnoses requiring more specific treatment.\nThe pathophysiology of septic encephalopathy is complex involving cross-talk across the blood\u2013brain barrier, microglial activation, endothelial swelling, a disruption of the blood\u2013brain barrier, vasogenic edema, leukocyte migration, impairment of cerebral autoregulation and perfusion, excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal and axonal injury. The most extreme manifestation of septic encephalopathy occurs in deep septic shock with bilateral hippocampal necrosis as a consequence of watershed infarctions (Tauber et\u00a0 al., 2017). Pathophysiological mechanisms have been discussed in detail in several recent publications (Perry et\u00a0al., 2003; Tauber et\u00a0al., 2017, 2021; Robba et\u00a0al., 2018; Too et\u00a0al., 2021; Sekino et\u00a0al., 2022; Dumbuya et\u00a0al., 2023; Barichello et\u00a0 al., 2023; Piva et\u00a0 al., 2023). This review will focus on biomarkers of septic encephalopathy which have already been successfully applied in clinical practice and which show promise as prognostic markers in older patients."

Therefore, general biomarkers of sepsis alone or in combination generally do not display sufficiently high levels of specificity to discriminate between sepsis without and with septic encephalopathy. For this reason, it is crucial to differentiate between biomarkers of sepsis from those of septic encephalopathy. Specific markers of septic encephalopathy are compounds produced/released exclusively by the brain. For sepsis, a large variety of biomarkers has been identified, including soluble pattern recognition molecules (PRMs), elements of the complement system, several cyto- and chemokines, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), non-coding RNAs, microRNAs, cell membrane receptors, cell proteins, metabolites, and soluble receptors (Barichello et\u00a0al., 2022)."

In a retrospective study on the posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES, one of the radiological manifestations of septic encephalopathy) in 151 patients, both in univariate and multivariate analyses, higher levels of CRP were associated with in-hospital death (Siebert et\u00a0al., 2017) (Figure\u00a04).

Compared to survivors, non-survivors had higher plasma concentrations of cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10), but lower levels of IgM and the complement fractions C3 and C4, lymphocyte and CD4+, and CD8+ T cell counts. Low IgM or C3 plasma concentrations and low lymphocyte or CD4+ T cell counts in blood were independent risk factors for mortality (Tang et\u00a0al., 2023).\nFrontiers in Cellular Neuroscience 05 frontiersin.org\nSome inflammatory markers appeared to be\u00a0useful to differentiate between septic encephalopathy and other causes of delirium: higher levels of vascular cellular adhesion molecule-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, platelet-derived growth factor-AB/BB and RANTES [\u201cregulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted\u201d, chemokine C-C motif ligand 5 (CCL5)] and of brain-derived neurotrophic factor were observed in septic encephalopathy patients compared to patients with delirium by other causes (Tomasi et\u00a0al., 2017). IL-8 levels in the blood were associated with delirium in patients with infection, whereas IL-10 and amyloid-\u03b2 1\u201342 and 1\u201340 blood concentrations were elevated in delirium in non-infected patients (van den Boogaard et\u00a0al., 2011). In septic encephalopathy, coma patients (n = 18) displayed higher IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-12 plasma concentrations than delirium patients (n = 64) (Orhun et\u00a0al., 2019). Since circulating cytokines influence the endothelium and the parenchymal cells of many organs, their concentrations are rather general indicators of the severity of sepsis and no specific biomarkers of septic encephalopathy. The cytokines IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-\u03b1 are established for the assessment of outcome in sepsis (Ishikawa et\u00a0al., 2021; Xiao et\u00a0al., 2022). When septic encephalopathy was compared with sepsis without encephalopathy, plasma concentrations of brainderived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were higher in septic encephalopathy patients, whereas RANTES and IL-10 concentrations were lower in patients with than in patients without encephalopathy suggesting BDNF as a possible biomarker of septic encephalopathy (Tomasi et\u00a0al., 2017)."

They are relatively stable, present in many body fluids and probably able to pass the impaired blood\u2013brain barrier. Therefore, they have been proposed as biomarkers for septic encephalopathy. High plasma concentrations of microRNA-370-3p were observed in patients with septic encephalopathy, but not in patients with sepsis or uremia alone (Visitchanakun et\u00a0al., 2020). MicroRNA-29a, used for the surveillance of patients with pancreatic tumors, was elevated in patients with septic encephalopathy compared to patients with other forms of encephalopathy, and high concentrations were associated with a poor prognosis (Guo et\u00a0 al., 2021).

In a recent study, each of 12 patients with septic encephalopathy had a normal leukocyte count (normal \u22644/\u03bcl), and only 2 of 12 patients had a mild elevation of the CSF total protein concentration (Ehler et\u00a0al., 2019a,b). In another series of patients with septic encephalopathy, CSF protein often was slightly elevated, without elevation of CSF leukocytes, and no signs of intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis were noted (Chung et\u00a0al., 2020).\nConversely, in 11 of 12 patients with stroke-like symptoms caused by septic-embolic encephalitis, in CSF analysis some kind of inflammation was detectable. Abnormalities observed included CSF leukocytosis from 2 to 496 cells/\u03bcl (median 247 cells/\u03bcl), elevated protein content from 310 to 3,224 mg/L (median 923 mg/L), and elevated lactate concentrations from 2.2 to 6.7 mmol/L (median 3.5 mmoL/L) (Bitsch et\u00a0al., 1996). In patients with septic-metastatic encephalitis (n = 6), inflammation in the CSF on average was more pronounced than with septic-embolic encephalitis, and CSF pleocytosis was observed in all patients. The CSF leukocyte counts ranged from 17 to 10,000 cells/\u03bcl (median 473/\u03bcl), the CSF protein content from 478 to 4,249 mg/L (median 739 mg/L), and the CSF lactate from 2.8 to 7.9 mmoL/L (median 3.0 mmoL/L) (Bitsch et\u00a0al., 1996).\nTypically, a lumbar puncture is performed in patients with septic encephalopathy with delirium or mental obtundation to exclude meningitis or meningoencephalitis (Tauber et\u00a0 al., 2021). Nuchal\nFrontiers in Cellular Neuroscience 07 frontiersin.org\nrigidity is not a sensitive and not a specific sign of meningeal inflammation. Particularly in elderly and very young patients with bacterial meningitis, fever and nuchal rigidity can be\u00a0 absent. Therefore, in the elderly, definitive exclusion of meningitis or meningoencephalitis relies on CSF analysis (Miller and Choi, 1997; Tauber et\u00a0al., 2021).\nSince in humans proteins of the size of IgG need approximately 4 days to equilibrate between blood and CSF (Frick and Scheid-Seydel, 1958), CSF analysis in critically ill patients can be\u00a0complicated by rapid volume shifts, by plasmapheresis and immune absorption, and by the intravenous administration of albumin or immunoglobulins (Djukic et\u00a0al., 2022). The rapid correction of a strong intravascular volume deficit by intravenous electrolyte or glucose solutions can mimic an impairment of the blood-CSF barrier. Similarly, removal of a large fraction of the immunoglobulins in plasma by immune absorption can mimic abnormal intrathecal antibody synthesis in the Reiber-Felgenhauer diagrams. Conversely, the intravenous infusion of IgG can lead to an apparent disappearance of an intrathecal IgG synthesis in the Reiber-Felgenhauer diagrams, and the intravenous infusion of high doses of albumin can lead to an apparent disappearance of a blood-CSF barrier dysfunction and an imaginary intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis (Djukic et\u00a0al., 2022). Moreover, the entry of blood into the CSF can affect the use of ReiberFelgenhauer nomograms for the detection of intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis. Here, the IgM nomogram is most sensitive, and even a blood contamination by 0.1% can cause an apparent intrathecal IgM synthesis (Djukic et\u00a0al., 2022).\nA single lumbar puncture often is necessary to rule out meningitis or encephalitis. Repeated lumbar punctures, although desirable in order to analyze the course of the concentrations of biomarkers of septic encephalopathy in CSF, often are not feasible because of the poor health conditions of patients with septic encephalopathy including abnormalities of coagulation. The biomarkers successfully used in plasma/serum have been only occasionally employed in CSF (e.g. Ehler et\u00a0al., 2019a,b), although their CSF concentrations probably reflect neural injury more accurately than the respective plasma/ serum concentrations.\nA suggestion for parameters which can be\u00a0measured in plasma/ serum or CSF in routine clinical laboratories and may either serve as indicators of the severity of sepsis or surrogate markers for neuronal, axonal and astrocyte injury is listed in Table\u00a01."

The severity of EEG abnormalities correlated with outcome (Hosokawa et\u00a0al., 2014; Azabou et\u00a0al., 2015).

            "text": "The unambiguous diagnosis of septic encephalopathy can be\u00a0complicated, because electrolyte and metabolite disturbances (in particular hyponatremia, hypernatremia and hypercalcemia, hypoand hyperglycemia, lactate acidosis) and renal or hepatic failure, which may or may not be\u00a0related to sepsis in an individual patient, can cause similar clinical symptoms. For this reason, there is a strong need to clearly differentiate between neural injury caused by septic encephalopathy and damage caused by other mechanisms.\nConsidering the high variability in human samples, investigations with low patient numbers must be\u00a0interpreted cautiously. Although the incidence of septic encephalopathy is highest in old age, there is a lack of studies specifically addressing the utility of the available biomarkers in older persons."

            "text": "Basically, the pathology of septic encephalopathy can be\u00a0characterized by three steps, and biomarkers of each step should be\u00a0defined (Ehler et\u00a0al., 2020; Figure\u00a06):\n1. Systemic inflammation causes dysfunction of the cerebral endothelium. Since C-type natriuretic peptide is predominantly expressed in by endothelial cells and released during sepsis (Koch et\u00a0 al., 2011) and septic encephalopathy from endothelial cells, its N-terminal propeptide (NT-proCNP) may serve as an indicator of injury to the cerebrovascular endothelium (Ehler et\u00a0 al., 2020). Whether it is really more specific for cerebrovascular dysfunction than procalcitonin or C-reactive protein remains to be\u00a0determined.\n2. The key event causing neuronal injury in septic encephalopathy is the activation of microglial cells (Yan et\u00a0al., 2022). In the absence of plasma/serum biomarkers of microglial activation, S100B as a marker of glial cell damage has been proposed for the monitoring of microglial activity (Ehler et\u00a0 al., 2020). A specific marker truly quantifying microglial activity would represent a major advance for the monitoring of sepic encephalopathy.\n3. Death of neurons and damage to axons and synapses is the morphological correlate of long-term neurocognitive deficits after septic encephalopathy. Although primarily an indicator of axonal injury, neurofilament light chains (NfL) have been proposed as an indicator of neuronal damage (Ehler et\u00a0 al., 2020). We\u00a0 suggest that it may be\u00a0advantageous to also determine neuron-specific enolase (NSE) in plasma/serum. When hemolytic samples are excluded, NSE already established as a prognostic marker in hypoxic brain injury (Sharma et\u00a0al., 2022; Kim et\u00a0al., 2023) probably is a valuable tool for the quantification of neuronal injury in septic encephalopathy of older persons.\nAmong new biomarkers for septic encephalopathy not yet established in clinical practice, brain-specific microRNAs appear most promising (Suster and Feng, 2021; Antonakos et\u00a0al., 2022; Li et\u00a0al., 2023; Yuechen et\u00a0al., 2023).\nAuthor contributions\nRN conceived the study.
