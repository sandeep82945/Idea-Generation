1. **Investigate the effects of varying the length and composition of the appended peptide blocks on the optical properties of ALucs.** This could lead to the development of new ALucs with even more desirable optical properties, such as higher BL intensity, longer wavelength emission, or narrower emission spectra.
2. **Explore the use of ALucs in other bioassays and molecular imaging applications.** For example, ALucs could be used to develop new biosensors for detecting specific molecules or to track the activity of specific enzymes in living cells.
3. **Investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the relationship between the appended peptide blocks and the optical properties of ALucs.** This could lead to a better understanding of how luciferases work and how they can be engineered to produce desired optical outputs.
4. **Develop new computational tools for designing ALucs with specific optical properties.** This would make it easier to create ALucs with the desired optical properties for specific applications.
5. **Investigate the use of ALucs in combination with other optical reporters to create multimodal imaging probes.** This could lead to the development of new imaging probes that can provide more information about the biological processes being studied.
