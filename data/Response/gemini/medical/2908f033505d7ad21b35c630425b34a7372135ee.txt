1. **Investigate the effectiveness of a preoperative multimodal e-Health program in reducing postoperative complications and length of hospital stay in patients undergoing gastrointestinal cancer surgery.** This could be done through a randomized controlled trial comparing the e-Health program to usual care.


2. **Explore the feasibility and acceptability of a preoperative multimodal e-Health program in patients with low health literacy or limited access to technology.** This could be done through a qualitative study or a pilot trial.


3. **Develop and evaluate a preoperative multimodal e-Health program that is tailored to the individual needs of patients undergoing gastrointestinal cancer surgery.** This could be done through a user-centered design approach, involving patients and healthcare providers in the development and evaluation of the program.


4. **Investigate the long-term effects of a preoperative multimodal e-Health program on patient outcomes, such as quality of life, physical function, and psychological well-being.** This could be done through a longitudinal study following patients for several months or years after surgery.


5. **Explore the cost-effectiveness of a preoperative multimodal e-Health program compared to usual care.** This could be done through a cost-benefit analysis or a cost-effectiveness analysis.
