 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming the paper:

1. Conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to more definitively establish the rates of persistent postoperative opioid use (PPOU) and risk factors associated with PPOU in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery for bowel cancer. This would strengthen the evidence base for quality indicators related to identifying patients at high risk preoperatively.

2. Develop and validate a risk prediction tool specific to PPOU in bowel cancer surgery patients. This could incorporate known risk factors and be used to identify high-risk patients preoperatively. 

3. Test different electronic clinical decision support systems for implementing procedure-specific opioid prescribing protocols and guidelines. Compare their effectiveness in reducing discharge opioid amounts and duration.

4. Conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing a multimodal, opioid-sparing analgesia protocol to standard opioid analgesia for bowel cancer surgery patients. Assess differences in PPOU rates, opioid-related adverse events, quality of recovery, and other outcomes.

5. Interview patients after bowel cancer surgery to better understand their experiences with education, pain management, opioid prescribing, tapering, and follow-up care. Use this to inform patient-centered improvements in perioperative opioid stewardship interventions.
