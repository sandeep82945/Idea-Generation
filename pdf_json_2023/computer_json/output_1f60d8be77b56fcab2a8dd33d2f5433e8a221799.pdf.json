Along with the improvement of service quality and user experience, this work provides an innovation method for operators and different associated businesses to tackle new challenges in 5G.\nINDEX TERMS 5G, charging system, dynamic step, quota\nI. INTRODUCTION\nBusiness Support System (BSS), an important component of communication services, is significant in business benefit analysis, end-to-end automatic provisioning, time-to-market and complicated service provisioning, product demand support, and quantum communication [1-3]. However, communication service consumption has swiftly shifted from traditional voice services to data services due to the emergence and rapid development of Over the Top (OTT) business [4]. In 2020, the average monthly mobile data in China has reached 11.3 GB, which is 4.2 times that of 2017 [5]. This data continues to increase with the popularization of fourth/fifth (4G/5G) generation and the rising number of mobile data services, which has brought enormous pressure on the performance of communication operators\u2019 charging systems. For many years, traditional telecom service providers and relative telecom forums have contributed to addressing these new challenges by optimizing logical architecture and updating operation mode in a variety of ways, including integrating core legacy mainframe business and operation support systems (OSS) with new generation\ncomponents, Cloud-centric BSS/OSS, introducing concepts of big data and algorithms, etc. [6-10].\nInstead of upgrading or replacing the entire charging system, developing techniques to minimize losses is more profitable and realistic as previous research has shown that overloading caused by incorrect calculation of subscriber data can result in losses for communication operators [11]. A converged charging system in which different types of subscribers are served on the same platform was previously reported, and it reduced the charging system load on the charging system at critical state due to the off-line charge [12]. To alleviate the data pressure on the 5G radio access network, a novel charging scheme was proposed in 2020, which was quantitatively presented as a closed-form formula, where the correlations among network capabilities, such as transmission delay, reliability, rate, and coverage, are provided [13]. Considering the great commercial potential of the rapid development and wide application of internet and cloud computing, Fang et al. [14] studied a dynamic charging model on a massive data analysis platform under the incorporation of changeable source price and SLA\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

However, most studies attempted to compress the large original calculated amount to lessen the loading of the computing system. Algorithm-related reports for reducing the risk of overloading by optimizing the process are rare.\nThe step size is important in analyzing algorithm complexity and is widely used in various fields, such as mathematics, engineering, and agriculture [15-18]. In comparison with the static step where the capture efficiency is reduced, the dynamic step improves the overall performance of the algorithm by optimizing local and global data processing, and its convergence speed and accuracy have been greatly improved [17,19-20]. In this study, a dynamic-step-based charging strategy model with multidimensional analysis on user\u2019s historical usage behavior and real-time charging elements was established from the actual construction of the operator\u2019s charging system for the individuation and differentiation trend of charging quotas. Meanwhile, the availability of the proposed model is verified with operator\u2019s real charging data, indicating that the proposed model improves the intelligence level of 5G service production and operation and effectively solves charging efficiency problems caused by the skyrocketing 5G message volume."

            "text": "This section is mainly divided into three parts, namely, scene-based 5G converged charging architecture, algorithmrelated random forest, and strategy-related quota and step size.\nA. 5G CONVERGED CHARGING ARCHITECTURE\nThe network construction of telecom operators typically follows the unified architecture and protocol specifications formulated by the International Organization for Standardization Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP, 3rd generation partnership project). The charging system and protocol supporting the network construction will also refer to the technical standards of 3GPP because the original charging information is obtained from the core network elements and platforms.\nThe 3GPP-defined 4G charging architecture covers online and offline charging modes. During the online charging process, all charging information is sent by the core network element in the form of real-time messages and received by the Online Charging System (OCS), which enables operators to perform real-time credit evaluation to effectively control arrears. Meanwhile, offline charging mode means that the core network element transmits the charging event in the form of a Charging Data Record (CDR) file to the offline charging system for charging processing when the telecommunication service is used up or at a certain interval. In the offline charging mode, the untimely payment risk may increase due to the timeless credit control.\nSome major changes were observed in the 5G charging structure compared with 4G. The 5G network function unit sends charging messages to the Converged Charging System (CCS) through the converged charging interface in the SBI bus regardless of whether online charging or offline in the 5G charging mode, and CCS performs charging processing, which is called converged charging. In terms of message protocol, the bearer protocol is modified from 4G Diameter to HTTP/2 [21-22].\nThe differences of charging architecture between 4G and\n5G are shown in Table 1.\nIn comparison with the 4G era, the 5G charging mode, network element structure, and charging architecture have been significantly changed and optimized, which proposed requirements for the operators\u2019 charging systems to improve the charging efficiency."

By contrast, the random forest algorithm has better performance in terms of prediction because it adapts to nonlinearities found in the data. Specifically, the random forest algorithm is well suited to analyzing large datasets and predicting nonlinearities. Furthermore, the random forest algorithm still works when the number of estimated parameters exceeded the number of observations due to the reuse of predictor variables [24].\nThe random forest algorithm is widely used in sensing image classification, statistical learning, medical science, and engineering because of its advantages in nonlinearity and computational process [25-28]. However, the basic usage of random forest algorithm in the charging system of communication operators where the data set is particular complex and large is rarely reported. Thus, the use of random forest algorithm in practical applications, such as charging and operation systems of companies, must be studied.\nIn addition, the user daily data traffic forecast model and\nRG distribution model were studied in this work based on the random forest algorithm."

            "text": "The online charging mode, a mechanism where the charging information affects the use of telecommunication services in real time, requires the direct interaction between charging systems and network elements. The network element must obtain OCS- or CCS authorization to use network resources before initiating the online charging mode. The OCS or CCS queries the user\u2019s balance according to the business volume request message reported by the network element, calculates the authorized business volume according to the pricing rules corresponding to the sales products ordered by the user, and locks the account balance until the user\u2019s business ends or the balance is exhausted. The business volume granted to a network element after the calculation by OCS or CCS in the online charging mode is called a quota.\nThe 5G converged charging architecture applies the same set of message charging process for the integration of the 4G online and offline charging modes. Although the complexity of the interconnecting network elements in the charging systems may be increased by this method, it lays a protocol foundation for the flexible management and control of offline charging. The longstanding problem that the offline charging process can only transfer files according to fixed rules (fixed file size or time) has been solved, as promised in the offline charging process by the newly added trigger types, such as traffic limits in the R15 release of 3GPP that the frequency of offline charging messages is actively controlled by the CCS. The traffic quota granted by the CCS to the network element and the quota in the online charging process are collectively called charging step size.\nThe step size can be dynamically set according to the user attributes and balance data. For example, a larger step size can\nbe set for users with high reputation or large balance to solve the drawbacks of fixed step size. The system capabilities may be improved by optimizing the dynamic step size to reduce system pressures for the explosive growth of charging information after the mature commercial use of 5G networks. However, the improvement effect of this method is insufficient due to the restrictive conditions."

            "text": "The 5G step sizes include time and data traffic step sizes. When either of these step sizes reaches the upper limit or threshold, the NE triggers the charging request to the charging system to complete an interaction and obtain the next step. Table 2 shows the number of message records (the number of charging requests of NEs) and the difference of reminders (the difference between the actual data traffic usage and the reminder threshold) under different step sizes. The choice of step size directly affects the pressure of the charging system and the user experience. Expanding the step size will reduce the interaction frequency of the charging requests to minimize the system pressure, and reducing the step size will shorten the interval of charging requests to improve the user satisfaction.\nIn this work, a two-stage dynamic step sizes strategy is proposed on the basis of 5G converged charging architecture to reduce the system pressure and satisfy user experience. This mechanism is different from the traditional fixed step that only reflects the relatively static charging factors. The proposed strategy was further adjusted and optimized by referring to the step size predicted by the historical behavior and digital twins of personal data traffic on the artificial intelligence (AI) platform to obtain more consistent results.\nIn the first stage, the massive real data provided by the operator\u2019s big data platform are used to create the step size prediction model. The model accurately predicts the appropriate step size to reduce the system pressure. In the second stage, the dynamic step size adjustment strategy was performed, taking into account the real-time data traffic of users and the situation of system pressure, improving user satisfaction through real-time control.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

The interaction used data traffic is the actual used data traffic of the user for this interaction when the maximum data traffic or time step is reached. The diagram shows the difference of the interactive used data traffic and system computing power under four strategies, including fixed step size (top left), single first stage (top right), single second stage (bottom left), and a combination of two stages (bottom right).\nFIGURE 2. Expected computing power to the interactive used data traffic with different stages\nThe fixed step size is a quota based on experience, such as 100 M data traffic step and 60 min time step. The interactive used data traffic and computing power of the fixed step size strategy are set with a baseline value of one to facilitate the comparison between the four strategies.\nThe step size results fit the user's historical usage behavior by using the first stage strategy alone, resulting in a larger step size than the fixed step size. Consequently, the interactive used data traffic will become larger than the fixed step size, and the computing power will become smaller than the fixed step size. Given that the one-stage prediction is not calculated in real time, the step size is still different from the actual use flow. Thus, the control is inaccurate at the reminder point.\nDuring the second stage strategy process alone, the step size is adjusted by referring to the remaining amount of the user\u2019s package (real-time parameters, such as system pressure, in the second phase are omitted in the figure for easy comparison). According to the charging cycle rules of the natural month, the data traffic usage of most users will approach the threshold of the reminder at the end of the month. Accordingly, the step size will not change in most periods in the first part of the natural month. In some moments near the end of the month, the step size will be reduced and adjusted to minimize the reminder deviation. Given that this strategy only refers to the remaining amount of the user\u2019s package, the charging system needs to calculate and judge regularly once the network element triggers the calculation application. Thus, the computing power will become larger than the fixed step size.\nThe combination of two stages achieves complementary advantages, which not only minimizes the system computing power requirements by expanding the step size as a whole but also reduces the step size in time to give users timely reminder service at the end of the month when most users reach the threshold of reminder service (sending the information about consumption, charging detail, promotion, and other data through SMS, phone calls, etc.)."

In summary, the data traffic usage of users continuously changes with the date and hour, and the traffic usage is relatively random without any obvious periodic rule.\nThe direct prediction of hourly RG traffic should include all RGs, and the number of algorithms affected-features exceeds 200. Accordingly, the optimization model must be adjusted at once with the increase in RG. The RG number of each user\u2019s ordered and sold products is less than 5% compared with the total RG number. The importance of different RGs for traffic prediction varies for different users. The RG and other features are analyzed together, and the analysis dimension is the number of other elements multiplied by the number of RG, which increases the complexity of the algorithm and the calculation time, and fails to highlight the importance of the impact of the ordered RG on their traffic usage.\nBased on the actual situation and theoretical analysis, directly predicting the effect of the hourly RG traffic model does not meet the practical requirements, and the model must be optimized with the change of RG, which increases the practical operation challenge. This research proposes a twostep method to predict the daily and hourly traffic in combination with the above-mentioned analysis. The first step ensures the accuracy of the user\u2019s daily traffic prediction, and the second step highlights the impact of time period and RG on the user\u2019s traffic usage.\nThe model establishment is divided into feature selection, data traffic prediction, traffic content daily usage ratio calculation, and step size prediction."

The prediction model makes different attempts for random forest, GBDT, and LSTM. Random forest and GBDT perform cross-validation to obtain the optimal parameters by grid search method, and the LSTM automatically optimizes the learning rate and sequence step size to obtain the optimal model. In this part, the random forest, GBDT, and LSTM models were trained with the evaluation indicators of MSE, mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R2). In Table 5, the random forest daily data traffic forecasting model has better fitness than the other two models, with the smallest MSE and MAE values, and the maximum R2 is close to one.\nIn comparison with random forest and GBDT, LSTM requires a large amount of data to construct traffic usage time series. The historical traffic usage records that can be analyzed are only 12 months, and the time period is relatively small, so\nthe algorithm training is insufficient. The correlation between user traffic usage and non-temporal characteristics is unclear, the input characteristics of the traffic time series algorithm are fixed, and the model is not flexible. The usage of user traffic is random, most of the data have certain rules, and a small amount of data have large differences. The GBDT model is more sensitive to abnormal data than random forest.

The punishment and reward functions were introduced in this study with the inversely relationship between the value of functions and the degree of optimization for an effective evaluation of the solutions. Table 6 provides the definitions of the algorithm symbols.\nIn a certain period, the times of interactions and the total cost decreased with the increase in the step size in the time dimension.

The red list and government and enterprise users have lower experience requirements than standard users; thus, the increased coefficients are 1.1 and 1.2, respectively, according to their requirements. Users with arrear risk have higher experience requirements than ordinary users. According to the degree of risk, the coefficient of low risk is 0.9, and the coefficient of high risk is 0.8.

In this case, the reminder traffic error can be reduced by increasing the interaction as decreasing the step size when the traffic usage is close to the reminder threshold.\nThe stability of the charging system is also a key operational indicator. When the request volume of NEs abnormally increased, or the system pressure was overloaded, system abnormalities and service errors may occur. In this case, the operating pressure of the charging system can be\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

The user prediction step is proportionally reduced with the step size compression based on the user\u2019s business usage, such as the total amount of usage volume and the remaining amounts of sales products. Step size expansion is based on the system busy degree, backlog, holidays, and other real-time system operating conditions, adjusting the prediction step size of all users and increasing it by a certain proportion.\nTable 9 shows the amend rule records of step size for the high-traffic risk adjustment strategy with a step size compression rule. Rules are set based on the proportion of used traffic to the total amount of usage volume, and the step size control of traffic is preferred to set its coefficient smaller. When the ratio between the used data traffic and the total amount of usage volume is in the range of [79%,80%], and the charging system has not sent the reminder message to the user, the risk of not timely reminding the user is increased, and the data traffic step and time step should be reduced. However, the user still has part of the remaining amount at this time, so the step size compression range is small. Flow and time steps are multiplied by the coefficients of 0.4 and 0.5, respectively. When the user has to use flow and provide the proportion of the total in the [80%, 99%) interval, a charging system has sent reminder messages to the user, and the user has not yet been slowed down, thereby failing to timely remind users risk disappearance. Moreover, prediction the step length is not adjusted, and the coefficient is one. When the proportion of the used data traffic to the total usage volume presented in [99%, 100%), and the using speed was limited to slow down by rules, the risk of the late reminder increased, and the data traffic and time steps are multiplied by the coefficients of 0.3 and 0.5, respectively. When the proportion of the used data traffic to the total usage volume is in [100%, up), the using speed must be slowed down, the risk of the late reminder increased, and the user has no usage volume results in the biggest compression. Furthermore, using the same flow as before took a long time due to the decrease in speed. Accordingly, the flow and time steps are multiplied by coefficients 0.2 and 1, respectively. When the user ordered an optional package to go back to the normal using speed, and the usage of this optional package is in the range of [0, 500) Mb, failed to timely remind users increased risk, at the same time use the same flow rate due to shorter speed recovery time and flow and time step multiplied by the coefficient of 0.2 and 0.3 respectively.\nTABLE 9.

The number of interactive message records, CDR, and promptness rate of the reminders between traditional fixedstep-size and dynamic-step-size are compared and inspected, and the authorized step size distributions are calculated.\nThe verification excluded the base station-related subscribers because the changes of base stations affected the number of interactions between network elements and charging systems.\nThe fixed step size for the traffic limit parameter is set to 100 Mb, and the step size for the time dimension (the time limit) is set to 60 min. The dynamic traffic step size range is (0,4096] Mb, and the growth interval is 10 Mb. The dynamic time step range is (0,240] min, and the growth interval is 10 min.\nThe forecast execution frequency is set to start from 0:00 and end at 5:00 every day, and the scheduled execution takes 5 h in total. Two groups of 5G charging interaction simulations were simultaneously performed for 30 days, and the second group was adjusted using the dynamic step size at 0:00 on the 8th day. All verifications are performed when the system pressure is stable, and no step size correction was triggered by the system pressure.\nThe parameters involved in this work, such as special group user weighting parameters, risk traffic adjustment strategy parameters, and system pressure adjustment parameters, are set according to the purpose of compression or step size expansion and summarized from the operating experience of China Telecom. The parameter setting will not affect the user traffic usage behavior, and the influence on the user perception results is known. Therefore, this work only explains the scene applicability of the parameters and does not carry out comparative experimental verification of whether the parameters are optimal, which can be used as the direction of research work in the next stage."

In addition, the recorded data for the first week is performed without the dynamic step charging mechanism for better illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism.\nAccording to the records of the second group, the number of records that did not start the experiment was the same. The number of the records for the second week decreased by 33.04%, the record in the third week decreased by 31.28%, and the records in the fourth week decreased by 33.18% when compared with the records of the first group.

After the selection of features based on the user\u2019s behavior, the dynamic step size is predicted by using the random forest algorithm, user daily traffic forecast model, and RG distribution model. To ensure the efficiency of the proposed dynamic step size, the monthly traffic usage data of 13,000 users from China Telecom were utilized to verify the charging mechanism. During the optimization analysis after the verification of the dynamic step size mechanism, the expected compliance of the dynamic step charging mechanism was proved by the examination of the distribution characteristics of the time and traffic steps. The results of the charging record optimization analysis indicated that the proposed charging mechanism enables the effective reduction of the interaction frequency between network elements and charging system by about 35%, and the number of monthly charging details records decreased by more than 30%.
