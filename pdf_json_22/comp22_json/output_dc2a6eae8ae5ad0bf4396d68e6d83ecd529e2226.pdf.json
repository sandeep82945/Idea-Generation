    "abstractText": "Recent advances in soft continuum robots revealed the need for accurate models, required to develop advanced control strategies. In this paper a general methodology is presented that allows to create an accurate inverse kinematic control based on hyperelastic models, fitted on mechanical material properties. This methodology is based on finite element analysis (FEA) and links the mechanical properties of the material to the simulated behaviour of a Pneunet actuator. This procedure is valid for any sort of hyperelastic material used in soft robotics, however, as a case study, a specific material with a self-healing ability is considered. This elastomeric polymer can recover from macroscopic damages without losing its mechanical performances, after undergoing a heat treatment. In this article, an accurate characterisation of the mechanical behaviour of this material is provided, involving mechanical testing, both in tensile and compression. On this experimental characterisation data constitutive laws are fitted, using a FEA simulator. The robustness of this material modelling is shown, re-fitting the curve for material samples that were exposed to multiple damagehealing cycles. With this obtained constitutive model, a FEA simulation of a bending soft pneumatic actuator is developed. The simulation results are experimentally validated with a dedicated test bench consisting of a pressure control unit and a motion tracking camera. Using this validated model, an inverse kinematic control is developed, including the FEA simulation in the control scheme.",

INTRODUCTION\nSoft robotics has become a multidisciplinary field, in which multiple scientific communities are cooperating in order to create safe and adaptive robots. Inspired by embodied intelligence found in nature, soft robots are developed with increased complexity and previously unexploited behaviours. However, from a control perspective, most soft robotic systems cannot be modeled using traditional principles because of their continuum structure [1]. In addition, the use of smart materials, including self-healing polymers [2], permits new additional features, but in many cases complicates the modelling and control. Considering the geometrical complexity of soft robots and the mechanical behaviour of the materials they are composed of, recently model-based and model-free control strategies have appeared in literature [1]. This paper focuses on a model-based approach using Finite Element Analysis (FEA)\n*corresponding author email : pasquale.ferrentino@vub.be\nto model and control a soft pneumatic actuator. This FEAbased control is made recently possible because of increases in computational power of hardware that result in faster FEA simulations, reaching high-speed velocities [3]. We describe a general methodology that makes a bridge between the mechanical properties of hyperelastic materials and the model-based control of a soft actuator (Fig.1). This procedure is valid for any sort of hyperelastic material used in soft robotics [4]. As case study, a self-healing Pneunet actuator [5] is considered, since position and force controllers are largely lacking for these novel type of soft actuators. This FEA approach has many advantages in comparison to previous modelbased techniques. In particular, it avoids to approximate the degree of freedom of the soft robotic actuator or manipulator, as is done when developing a Constant Curvature (CC) model [6] and a Piecewise Constant Curvature model (PCC) [7]. Both are based on modified Denavit-Hartenberg parameters and used to model multi-section continuum actuators and manipulators that have larges non-planar motions. But these techniques, as demonstrated in [8], show lacks of accuracy. Furthermore, using directly a FEA simulation in the control scheme leads to an accurate approximation of the soft robot geometry, avoiding the geometrical assumptions of the Timoshenko beam theory [9] and the Cosserat Rod Theory [10], [11] techniques. The FEA software platform used in this article is SOFA [12], an opensource framework that is used for interactive soft mechanics simulations and also allows generating an inverse kinematic algorithm based on the Optimization technique [13], [14]. In Section III, an accurate characterisation of the mechanical behaviour of the elastomer is presented, including mechanical testing on tensile and compression samples and the curve fitting with hyperelastic constitutive models, using an FEA simulator. The fitting of these constitutive models is evaluated and the most suitable model for the self-healing material is selected. Furthermore, the healing performance of the material is evaluated by re-fitting the models on material samples that underwent several damage-healing cycles (Section IV). Next, in Section V, using the obtained constitutive model, an FEA simulation of the soft actuator is developed in SOFA. By manufacturing the self-healing actuator and characterising it in a dedicated test bench, described in Section VI, the FEA model is validated (Section VII). Then, an inverse kinematic controller for the self-healing soft bending actuator is developed, by using the FEA simulation in the control scheme, which allows to perform bending angle control (Section VIII)."

            "text": "Pneunet actuators are extensively used in academics and industry because of their safety features and their adaptability, when in contact with a grasped object, which can have a complex shape. However, as they are made from soft elastomers they tend to get damaged by sharp objects [5]. Consequently, in previous work made by our research group [2], [15], these actuators were constructed out of self-healing Diels-Alder polymers and can heal from macroscopic damages. A self-healing BSPA (bending soft pneumatic actuator) is selected as case study, of which the dimensions can be found in Fig. 2a) and a picture in Fig.2b). The wall thickness is 2.5 mm, thicker compared to 0.75 mm, used in our previous designs [15]. Consequently, the power output of this thicker actuator is increased. The actuator is constructed via compression moulding [16] using a Diels-Alder polymer, DPBM-FT5000r0.5, which chemical composition described in [15]. Aside\nfrom being healable, this Diels-Alder material can be easily recyclable, further increasing its sustainability."

This complete study of the mechanical properties requires high technological and expensive characterisation equipment that is not present in many research labs. Consequently, in this work, the mechanical characterisation is limited to uniaxial tension and compression tests, accompanied with a Poisson ratio measurement. Nonetheless, it will be demonstrated that with this limited number of material tests, an accurate model of the mechanical behaviour of the material can be obtained. Both the uniaxial tensile and compression tests are executed on a Dynamic Mechanic Analyzer (DMA) Q800 of TA instruments, with switchable tensile and compression clamps. For the tensile test, rectangular samples of 30.0 x 3.8 x 2.3 mm3 are made, while for the compression test, cylindrical specimens are constructed with a diameter of 8.10 mm and a thickness of 3.20 mm. Both the uniaxial compression and tension tests are performed using a strain ramp of 1% per second. The tensile test is performed until fracture to derive the ultimate strain and stress at fracture. Both the tensile and compression engineering stress-strain curves are plotted in the graph in Fig.3a. The samples could withstand strains of more than 100 %, typical for soft robotics applications. In addition, a Poisson ratio (\u03bd) of 0.44 was determined. To do so, five measurements are taken at a series of discrete strains (5%, 10%, 25%, 50%) and this for 5 samples. Via linear regression on the collection of longitudinal and related lateral strain measurements, the Poisson ratio was determined."

            "text": "In literature there exist a number of constitutive laws that can be fitted onto the hyperelastic behaviour presented in Fig.3a, including Neo-Hookean, Mooney-Rivlin, Ogden and Yeoh constitutive models. In the following discussion, the material is assumed to be compressible, isotropic and homogeneous. The characteristic strain energy functions (W) for the above mentioned constitutive laws are presented in Table.I for compressible, isotropic and homogeneous hyperelastic materials. In these functions, I1, I2 and J are the three invariants of the Left Cauchy-Green deformation Tensor. The functions are characterised by the compressibility factor Di and the material constants Cik, \u00b5i and \u03b1i. In what follows, we present the methodology for fitting these constitutive on the\nexperimental data of the nominal stress (N1), nominal strains (\u03b51) (Fig.3 a) ) and Poisson ratio of 0.44.\nFirst of all, a material sample with a volume of \u2126 \u2208 IR3 is considered, which is subjected to an uniaxial mechanical test. The effect of its compressibility is expressed through the Poisson ratio. Consequently, the transversals strains, \u03b52 and \u03b53, can be written as a function of the nominal strain \u03b51 and the Poisson ratio (\u03bd), through the formula: \u03b52 = \u03b53 = \u2212\u03bd\u03b51. The three components \u03b51, \u03b52 and \u03b53 are also called principal strains. As written in [18], considering a generic point p \u2208 \u2126, the deformation gradient F is defined as:\nF = \u2207x\u03c6p = J 1 3 F (1)\nWhere \u03c6 is the displacement vector of the point p. Under compressible assumption J 6= 1 where J = det(F), the deformation gradient can be split into two contributions; a\nvolumetric (J\u2212 1 3 ) and an isochoric part (F). The left CauchyGreen Tensor (B) can be defined:\nB = F \u00b7 FT = J 23 B where B = F \u00b7 FT (2)\nwith the three invariants (I1, I2, J) defined as:\nI1 = tr(B) = \u03bb21 + \u03bb 2 2 + \u03bb 2 3\nI2 = 1\n2 [tr(B)2 + tr(B2)] = \u03bb21\u03bb 2 2 + \u03bb 2 2\u03bb 2 3 + \u03bb 2 1\u03bb 2 3\nJ = (det(B)) 1 2 = det(F) = \u03bb1\u03bb2\u03bb3\n(3)\nWhere \u03bbi are the principal stretches and are related to principal strains ( ) by the relation \u03bbi = 1 + i.Under the assumption of compressibility, the first two invariants are written as follows:\nI1 = J \u2212 23 I1 I2 = J \u2212 43 I2\n(4)\nUnder the assumption that the material is Isotropic, the strain energy function can be written as a function of the three invariants of Left Cauchy-Green deformation tensor, as the equations listed in Table.I. In what follows, as an example, the Strain Energy Function is derived for a compressible, isotropic and homogeneous material for the Neo-Hookean model. The methodology is identical for all constitutive laws presented in Table.I. The Neo-Hookean Strain Energy function (W) is given by:\nW = C10(I1 \u2212 3) + 1\nD1 (J \u2212 1)2 (5)\nFor a compressible, isotropic and homogeneous material the equation for the principal Cauchy stresses is written as:\n\u03c3i = \u03bbi \u2202W\n\u2202\u03bbi = C10[\u2212\n2 3 J\u2212 5 3\u03bbi \u2202J \u2202\u03bbi I1 + 2J \u2212 23\u03bb2i ]\n+ 2\nD1 (J \u2212 1)\u03bbi\n\u2202J\n\u2202\u03bbi\n(6)\nBecause J = \u03bb1\u03bb2\u03bb3 = \u03bbi \u2202J\u2202\u03bbi , the principal Cauchy stresses (Eq.6) can be expressed as:\n\u03c3i = \u03bbi J \u2202W \u2202\u03bbi = 2C10J \u2212 53 [\u03bb2i \u2212 I1 3 ] + 2 D1 (J \u2212 1) (7)\nThe nominal stresses (N) on the other hand can be derived from the Cauchy stresses (\u03c3) thanks to the following relationship:\nN = F\u22121J\u03c3 (8)\nNow that a relation is formed between the nominal stress and the material parameters C10 and D1 (Eq.7 and Eq.8), these parameters can be fitted using a Levemberg Marquadt algorithm. This is a least square method algorithm, which is governed by three parameters; the norm of residuals, the plot of residuals and the root mean square error (RMSE). The first parameter, the norm of residuals, is a parameter for the \u201dgoodness\u201d of the fitting. The closer to zero, the higher the quality of the fitting. The plot of residuals is a measure of the error of the fitting residuals around the middle value that is selected to be zero by definition. Lastly, the root mean square error gives the standard variation of the residuals around the middle value."

I). First of all, the Drucker stability [19] of the material constitutive equation [19] for the fitted curves is checked. The last column of Table.I shows the Neo-Hookean model and the first order of Ogden law respect the Drucker Stability requirement for all strains present in experimental data (0- 130%), while the Mooney-Rivlin law becomes unstable for \u03bb > 75%, the second order of Ogden for \u03bb > 58% and the Yeoh model for \u03bb > 89%. Consequently, these last three constitutive models are not stable for large strains and cannot be considered as an adequate hyperelastic models for the use of the self-healing material in large strain applications. Focusing on soft robotics, therefore the Neo-Hookean and the first order Ogden law were selected as possible candidates for modelling the material behaviour.\nTable.II shows the norm of residuals and the root-mean square error of the fitted Neo-Hookean and first order of the Ogden constitutive law. The Neo-Hookean model shows slightly lower values for both the norm of residuals and root mean square error. This means that the fitting for this constitutive law is slightly more accurate in comparison to the fit of the first order Ogden law. In addition, in Fig.3c, it is visible that although very similar, the absolute value of the residuals of the Neo-Hookean model is for each strain slightly lower than the Ogden law. As such, it can be concluded that the Neo-Hookean model provides the best approximation of the hyperelastic behaviour of the DBPM-F5000-r0.5 material. The resulting fitting parameter are presented in the last column of Table. II."

One pristine sample was fractured in a tensile test with a strain ramp om 1%s-1 to derive the fracture properties, the fracture stress (\u03c3max) and the fracture strain (\u03bbmax). The other five samples were cut completely in half, reconnected\nTABLE II: The norm of residuals and the root mean square error for the fitting of the first order Ogden law and the Neo-Hookean model on the DBPM-F5000-r0.5 hyperelastic material. The measure unit is in MPa. The values of the Neo-Hookean Law for both parameters are slightly lower, so that means this behaviour better approximates the material.\nHyperelastic Model Norm of Residuals RMSE Material Parameters Ogden N = 1 0.256 0.019 \u00b51 = 0.218 \u03b11 = 1.972 D1 = 1.144 Neo-Hookean 0.248 0.018 C10 = 0.109 D1 = 1.150\nand subsequently healed at 80 \u00b0C for 40 minutes (Fig. 4). Next, these samples were subjected to a tensile test upon fracture with the same strain ramp. When comparing the hyperelastic stress strain relation, it can be seen that the mechanical properties of the healed samples are recovered for strains up to 100 %. Traditionally, the healing efficiency can be defined based on the recovery of the fracture stress or the fracture strain (\u03b7\u03c3max = \u03c3max,healed/\u03c3max,ref , \u03b7 max = max,healed/ max,ref ). In Table III the averages of the mechanical properties derived in the tensile test until fracture are presented, as well as the root mean square error (RMSE) of the mean value on the results. For these healing tests, high healing efficiencies of 91% (\u03b7 max) and 96% (\u03b7\u03c3max) were achieved, respectively based on the strain and the stress. The healed samples did not break at the location of the healed cut, which further illustrates excellent healing performance. In addition, the Young\u2019s modulus is used to evaluate the healing, as illustrated in Table.III. It is derived by a linear regression in the 0-5% strain interval, and recovered with 103%. However, E, \u03c3max and max provide information on the recovery of the mechanical behaviour at very low stains (0-5%), and very high strains (110-130%). By fitting the Neo-Hookean model on both pristine and healed samples, the recovery of the mechanical behaviour can be evaluated across the entire strain window (0-130%), by checking the recovery of the material parameters. Table.III illustrates the material parameters C10 and D1 for both pristine and healed samples. It can be concluded that these parameters only differ slightly after healing, showing excellent recovery of the hyperelastic behaviour after healing."

            "text": "The final aim is to build an inverse kinematic controller with the FEA simulation working in the control scheme. Therefore, the simulation result has to be validated experimentally, to ensure that it is accurate enough to be used in an inverse kinematic controller. To do so a dedicated test bench that permits to control the inner pressure and characterise the actuator using motion tracking is built (Fig.5). Fig.5a shows the linear pressure controller system. The outlet of the 60 ml syringe is connected to the actuator and a digital\nFig. 6: a) Image of the actuator at 0.76 bar with nine blue markers. The figure also illustrates how the bending angle \u0398 is geometrically calculated as the angle between the origin and the tip. b) SOFA simulation with the selected nodes (green) in the meshed simulated actuator that coincide with the centroids of the nine blue markers on the actuator prototype. c) Segmented image, with in white, the highlighted position of the marker on a black background. The clustering is visible too, with the centroids of the markers in red.\npressure sensor by a tee male connector. The plunger of the syringe is attached to the nut by a 3D-printed interface, making it possible to linearly move by rotating the leadscrew, which is coupled to a stepper motor. Furthermore, the validation setup is composed of a 30x50x50 cm plexiglass box in which a RGBD camera is installed (5b). The camera tracks the position of the centroids of nine blue markers on the actuator during bending (Fig.6a). In the FEA, nine corresponding nodes are selected and their position is tracked during the simulation Fig.6b (green dots). The FEA model, with integrated Neo-Hookean model, is validated by comparing the position of the markers on the actuator with the selected nodes in the FEA simulation. To estimate the position of the markers, the camera is first calibrated with Zhang calibration method [21], after which the images of the camera are streamed through ROS (Robotic Operating System) and elaborated through a segmentation algorithm that highlights the blue markers in white, on a black background, Fig.6c). Finally, the frames of the segmented images are sent to a clustering algorithm, that recognizes the number of markers on the pneumatic actuator and calculates the centroid position through the camera calibration.\nVII. VALIDATION OF THE FEA SIMULATION\nThe experiments are made for two different orientations of the bending actuator in comparison to the gravitational field (g); an upwards bending with the gravity force that act against the motion (Fig. 7c) and a downwards bending with the gravity force assisting it (Fig. 7d). Both orientations are tested for three different pressures; 0.3 bar, 0.5 bar and 0.76 bar. When comparing the SOFA simulation (dashed lines) with the experimental tracking of the markers (crosses), it can be seen that the FEA model simulates well the bending characteristic for both configurations (Fig.7 a an b). The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), calculated between the marker\u2019s centroids positions detected by camera and the simulation positions (Table.IV), is below 1 mm for each pressure and configuration. This accuracy is sufficiently high such that this simulation can be used in the control scheme of a soft gripper. Furthermore, it can be seen that the simulation can take into account the direction of the gravitational field, which is important in soft gripper applications, in which the gripper rotates in the three dimensional space. Furthermore, Fig.7 e and f show the bending angle for the three pressure inputs as function of the normalized time, to demonstrate that the FEA simulation matches the reality for a bending action involving bending under an increasing pressure up to 0.3, 0.5 and 0.76 bar. The dashed lines are the data from the camera and the continuous lines are retrieved from SOFA simulations.\nVIII. INVERSE CONTROLLER\nBased on the validated FEA model, the inverse kinematic controller can be designed (Fig.8). An inverse controller of the bending angle is developed, defined as the angle between a vertical line through the base of the actuator and a segment through the base of the actuator and the tip (Fig.6a). As seen in Fig.8, starting from a desired bending angle (\u0398d), the controller will minimize the error between the desired value and the measured one (\u0398m). This error is multiplied by a gain matrix K, that provides the input for the SOFA scene, implemented using two important plugins: the Model\nOrder Reduction plugin [22] and the SoftRobots.Inverse plugin [13]. The first conserves the DOF of the scene object but decreases drastically the number of tetrahedrons in the mesh (from 64 thousand to 12), accelerating the scene performance in terms of frame per second (FPS). The SoftRobots.Inverse plugin [13] allows to resolve the inverse problem, calculating the pressure P needed to reach the desired angle based on the FEA simulation. This pressure is sent to the actuation system that tracks and estimate the actual angle with a camera, which works as feedback in the control scheme. The designed controller has a maximum speed of 20 Hz. Fig.9a-d show the results of the experiments of the bending angle\u2019s inverse controller. The pressure value retrieved from the inverse problem solver in SOFA, for this experiment, is about 0.5 bar. In particular to demonstrate the self-healing ability of the Diels-Alder polymer that is used in this article, the finger will undergo two damage/healing cycles. In each case, the actuator was damaged severely as seen in Fig.9e-f. However, these large damages can be healed by heating the actuator for 40 min to 90 \u00b0C. After healing, identical to Section VII, the experiments are repeated in the two different configuration with respect the gravitational field. Fig.9 a and c shown the trends of bending angle \u0398 as a function of time, for both configurations, while Fig.9 b and d illustrates the relative estimated error between the desired bending angle and the bending angle measured by the camera feedback. From the plots, it is clear that for the undamaged actuator (in blue) and the healed actuator, both for first (in magenta) and second damage/healing cycle (in black), the measured bending angle converge to the desired bending angle, confirming that after healing the actuator properties are recovered."

            "text": "In this paper, a methodology is presented to develop an inverse kinematic controller for soft pneumatic robots based on an experimental characterisation of the hyperelastic materials from which the system is constructed. It is illustrated that via uniaxial tension and compression test, hyperelastic constitutive models can be fitted on the experimental data, which can be used in a FEA model of the actuator. This methodology was tested for a self-healing Pneunet actuator developed out of a Diels-Alder polymer. Although in total five hyperelastic models, including Mooney-Rivlin, Neo-Hookean, Yeoh and Ogden First and Second Order laws, were fitted on the stress-strain data of the Diels-Alder material, the Neo-Hookean proved to form\nthe best fit for the entire strain window of 0-130%, in which these self-healing materials can be used. To further validate the Neo-Hookean model, the material constants were used in a FEA simulation in SOFA, an open source software, to simulate the bending behaviour of Pneunet actuator. In addition, a prototype was made via compression moulding of the Diels-Alder material and its motion during actuation was tracked on a characterisation setup with a pressure controller and motion tracking camera. The FEA simulation, and the embedded Neo-Hookean model, were validated by comparing the simulation and the experimental characterisation. For different pressures and different configurations in comparison to the gravitational field, root mean square errors of less than 1 mm were detected between tracked markers on the actuator prototype and corresponding selected nodes in the FEA simulations. This illustrates that only with a limited material characterisation, actuator models can be developed with an accuracy that is sufficient for a wide variety of soft robotic applications.\nThis validated FEA model, was used in a feedback inverse control scheme. In particular, SOFA simulation resolves the inverse problem and it is tested in bending angle, for an actuator that undergoes to two damage/healing cycles. The results are promising and show that the self-healing material doesn\u2019t lose mechanical properties and performance. In future works, this approach will be extended for multimaterial applications. Furthermore, the controller can evolve towards a dynamic controller in the future, as in the material model can be extended including viscoelastic properties. In this way the actuator can be tested in dynamic conditions, for example with sinusoidal or more complex controller inputs."
