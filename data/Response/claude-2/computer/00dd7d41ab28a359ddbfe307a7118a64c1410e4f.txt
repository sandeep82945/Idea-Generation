 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming:

1. Investigate other machine learning models like recurrent neural networks for multi-round transfer learning in lung cancer detection. The paper focused on convolutional neural networks, but RNNs may capture temporal patterns in medical imaging data.

2. Explore different loss functions and regularization techniques to further minimize negative transfer. The paper proposed custom loss functions, but there is room to experiment with other formulations. 

3. Evaluate the multi-round transfer learning approach on diverse medical imaging datasets beyond lung cancer, such as brain MRI scans. This could demonstrate the generalizability of the method.

4. Develop more advanced generative models like CycleGAN to synthesize intermediate domains between source and target. This could create higher quality bridging distributions. 

5. Perform multi-round transfer learning in a low-data regime by leveraging data augmentation and semi-supervised learning techniques. This could show the approach is viable when target data is extremely scarce.
