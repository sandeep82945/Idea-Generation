    "abstractText": "Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma accounts for approximately 90% of primary liver cancers and hepatitis virus was believed to have the potential for altering the pathogenesis of arteriosclerosis. However, the influence of the hepatitis virus on coronary artery disease or cerebral vascular disease remains unclear. This study used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database to clarify the virus-associated risk of coronary artery disease and cerebral vascular disease in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: A total of 188,039 HCC individuals, age 20 years or older, were enrolled from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database between 2000 and 2017 for cohort analysis. A total of 109,348 with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, 37,506 with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, 34,110 without HBV or HCV, and 7075 with both HBV and HCV were recorded. Statistically, propensity score matched by sex, age, and index year at a ratio of 15:5:5:1 and a sensitivity test using multivariable Cox regression were used. Results: The risk of coronary artery disease in the HCV-related HCC group was 1.516-fold (95% CI: 1.328\u20132.034, p < 0.001) higher than in the HBV-related HCC group, followed by the HBV/HCV-related HCC group and the non-B/C HCC group; the cerebral vascular disease risk in the HCV-related HCC group was 1.467-fold higher than in the HBV-related HCC group (95% CI: 1.335 to 1.786, p < 0.001), followed by the HBV/HCV-related HCC group and the non-B/C HCC group. Conclusion: Hepatitis C virus infection was found to have a higher risk of developing coronary artery disease or cerebral vascular disease in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. For patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, our findings warrant the importance in preventing artherosclerotic disease in the setting of hepatitis C",

HCC primarily occurs in patients with underlying liver disease, mainly due to viral infection or alcohol misuse [1]. Coronary artery disease (CAD) and cerebrovascular disease (CVD) are also major public health issues because of their considerable impact on disability and mortality in adults worldwide [2,3]. Given that nonalcoholic fatty liver disease may be related to atherosclerosis [4] and that the relationship between hepatitis virus and\nJ. Clin. Med. 2023, 12, 2602. https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm12072602 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/jcm\natherogenesis remains unclear, some types of hepatitis virus may influence the risk of CAD or CVD in patients with HCC. Some studies have indicated that no significant relationship exists between hepatitis B (HBV) infection and coronary atherosclerosis [5,6], whereas others have indicated that HBV infection is associated with lower risks of CAD [7] and stroke [8,9]. Furthermore, many systematic reviews and meta-analyses have indicated that hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a risk factor for CAD [10\u201312] and CVD [12\u201317]. The potential pathogenesis of reducing atherogenic risk by HBV infection includes that which disturbs lipid metabolism and reduces systemic inflammation [6,18\u201321]. On the contrary, HCV infection increases the atherogenesis by initiating chronic inflammation [22,23]. Several studies have shown that consumption of moderate alcohol (<30 g/day) may be helpful in preventing coronary artery disease [24]. However, high dose alcohol consumption also induces oxidative stress and a wide variety of inflammatory markers [25]. Together, these findings indicate that the hepatitis virus may alter the pathogenesis of arteriosclerosis. With advancements in the development of the hepatitis B vaccine and direct-acting antiviral agents, the incidence of HCC in patients without HBV or HCV infection (NBNC HCC) is gradually increasing [26,27]. To further our understanding of the influence of the hepatitis virus on CAD and CVD risk in patients with HCC, CAD/CVD risk in patients with NBNC HCC should also be examined. In this study, we used a nationwide database to analyze the risk of CAD and CVD in patients with viral hepatitis-related HCC and NBNC HCC."

The most prevalent comorbidities, including dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, and cirrhosis, were more common in the HBV/HCV-related HCC cohort than in other cohorts (all p < 0.0001, Table 1). After adjustment for sex, age, insured premium, dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, cirrhosis, urbanization level, and level of care with the Cox proportional hazards regression model, the risk of CAD in the HCVrelated HCC group was 1.516-fold (95% CI: 1.328\u20132.034, p < 0.001) higher than in the HBV-related HCC group, followed by 1.497-fold (95% CI: 1.292\u20131.995, p < 0.001) in the HBV/HCV-related HCC group and 1.153-fold (95% CI: 0.917\u20131.773, p = 0.094) in the NBNC HCC group (Table 2).

            "text": "This is the first study to use a nationwide population database to evaluate the association of hepatitis B and C virus with the risk of CAD and CVD in patients with HCC. Patients with HBV-related HCC had the lowest risk of both CAD and CVD among all cohort studies, followed by patients with NBNC HCC, HBV/HCV-related HCC, and HCV-related HCC. Atherosclerosis is a multifocal and immunoinflammatory disease affecting medium to large arteries caused by lipids; the most harmful consequences of atherosclerosis include CAD and CVD [31,32]. The lower risk of atherogenesis in patients with HBV-related HCC might be attributed to three factors: altered lipid metabolism, inflammation status, and immune system status. First, acute or chronic hepatitis due to HBV infection may disturb lipid metabolism and then reduce multiple atherogenic cardiometabolic risk factors, such as triglycerides, cholesterol, and lipoprotein [18\u201321]. Second, systemic inflammation facilitates endothelial dysfunction and arterial atherosclerosis. De-Yan Tong et al. reported that HBV infection was negatively correlated with systemic inflammation, as evaluated using C-reactive protein [6]. Third, HBV infection may induce some cytokines to protect the vascular endothelium, such as hepatocyte growth factor [33\u201335]. However, compared to our results, some studies did not find a significant association between risk of atherogenesis and HBV infection patients [5,6]. One previous study from a population of high HBV prevalence further expressed that HBV serological markers including hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B surface antibody, hepatitis B e antigen, hepatitis B e antibody and hepatitis B core antibody were not significantly related with CAD [6]. In comparison, patients with HCV-related HCC had a significantly higher risk of CAD and CVD, which may be due to the following mechanisms. First, HCV structural and nonstructural proteins play major roles in initiating and maintaining chronic inflammation [22,23], which then promotes liver fibrogenesis [36]. A higher prevalence of atherosclerosis observed in chronic HCV infection has been correlated with liver fibrosis [37,38]. Second, chronic HCV infection is an independent predictor of cerebrovascular deaths, likely due to high serum HCV RNA levels [14]. Moreover, Shoeib et al. indicated that multivessel affection was found in 47.8% of HCV-positive patients compared with 22.2% of HCV-negative patients [39]. In a previous systematic review and meta-analysis conducted by Lee KK et al., considerable geographical variation was identified in the burden of cardiovascular disease attributable to HCV, with the highest burden observed in South Asia, Eastern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, which had geographical proximity to our study [12].\nWe supposed that patients with viral hepatitis-related HCC might have the original characteristics in the atherogenic mechanism. Our study confirmed that for patients with hepatitis virus B or C infection, the prevalence of CAD/CVD still had the same trend after HCC occurrence. Our data also indicated that patients with NBNC HCC had a higher CAD/CVD risk than the HBV-related HCC group. This may have been because of alcohol use or metabolic syndrome; however, because these data are not available in the NHIRD, we could not perform a related analysis. A Korean study reported that heavy alcohol use was the most common potential etiology in NBNC HCC [30], and a Japanese nationwide survey of people with NBNC HCC found that in addition to older age, obesity, comorbidities of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, lifetime alcohol consumption may be a crucial risk factor for this group [26]. Because of cultural similarities and geographical proximity, alcohol consumption and metabolic syndrome may also explain the higher risk of CAD and CVD in our cohort of Taiwanese patients with NBNC HCC. Although patients with HBV/HCV coinfection tend to have more severe liver injury than patients with HBV or HCV monoinfection due to a higher probability of liver cirrhosis and hepatic decompensation [40], the potential protective effect of HBV infection on atherogenesis might also explain the lower prevalence of CAD/CVD in this group than that in the HCV-related HCC group in our study."

            "text": "The three primary strengths of our cohort study include the presentation of the incidence trends in the most recent decade between 2000 and 2017, control of comorbidities, and the use of national data with a large sample size. However, there are a number of limitations in the present study. First, the NHIRD lacks information on patients\u2019 risk factors and other unmeasured confounders for atherogenic disease (e.g., dietary habit, alcohol consumption, tobacco smoking, body mass index). Second, the NHIRD does not provide data on associated laboratory data results, including liver function tests, serum albumin level, serum HBV or HCV viral load, and serum C-reactive protein levels, or imaging data, including abdominal computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging data. Without these data, tumor stage, Child\u2013Pugh score, and inflammation level could not be well characterized. Third, we could not investigate the likely protective factors for atherogenic disease, such as physical activity and prophylactic medicines prescribed for hypertension. Moreover, data on individual therapies involving anti-HBV or anti-HCV agents were unavailable, and the actual impact of viral infection might have been overestimated or underestimated. Finally, the retrospective cohort design precluded the analysis of cause\u2013 effect relationships. Further prospective randomized studies are warranted."

            "text": "In this large population-based database study of patients with viral hepatitis-related HCC or NBNC HCC, we demonstrated that HBV-related HCC and HCV-related HCC were associated with significantly lower and higher risks of CAD/CVD, respectively. These findings have crucial clinical implications for reducing the associated burden in both CAD and CVD. For patients with HCC and HCV infection, our study reveals that more effort should be devoted to preventing CAD/CVD development.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, M.-C.L., Y.-H.W. and H.-W.C.; data curation, C.-H.C.; formal analysis, C.-H.C.; investigation, C.-H.C.; methodology, W.-C.C.; resources, C.-H.C. and W.-C.C.; software, C.-H.C.; supervision, M.-C.L. and H.-W.C.; validation, W.-C.C. and C.-H.C.; visualization, H.-H.L., T.-Y.H. and P.-J.C.; Writing\u2014original draft, M.-C.L.; Writing\u2014review and editing, M.-C.L., Y.-H.W. and H.-W.C.
