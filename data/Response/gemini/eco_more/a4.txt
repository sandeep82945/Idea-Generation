1. **Extend the model to account for the dynamics of network formation.** The current model assumes that the network is static, but in reality, networks are constantly evolving. Extending the model to account for dynamics would allow us to study how the network structure affects the spread of vulnerabilities over time.
2. **Incorporate additional covariates into the model.** The current model only includes a limited number of covariates, such as the size and popularity of repositories. Incorporating additional covariates, such as the age of repositories, the number of contributors, and the programming language used, would allow us to better understand the factors that contribute to the spread of vulnerabilities.
3. **Develop a more sophisticated model of vulnerability contagion.** The current model assumes that all vulnerabilities are equally contagious. In reality, some vulnerabilities are more contagious than others. Developing a more sophisticated model of vulnerability contagion would allow us to better understand how the characteristics of vulnerabilities affect their spread.
4. **Study the effectiveness of different vulnerability mitigation strategies.** The current study only considers a single vulnerability mitigation strategy: protecting the most systemic repositories. Studying the effectiveness of different vulnerability mitigation strategies would allow us to identify the most effective ways to reduce the spread of vulnerabilities.
5. **Apply the model to other software ecosystems.** The current study only considers the Rust Cargo ecosystem. Applying the model to other software ecosystems would allow us to understand how the network structure and vulnerability mitigation strategies affect the spread of vulnerabilities in different contexts.
