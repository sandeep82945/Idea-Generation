Madeira1\n1Departamento de F\u0301\u0131sica and CeFEMA, Instituto Superior Te\u0301cnico, Universidade de Lisboa, Av. Rovisco Pais, 1049-001 Lisboa, Portugal\n(Dated: August 24, 2022)\nWe consider the influence of topological phases, or their vicinity, on the spin density and spin polarization through a chiral chain. We show the quantization of the Berry phase in a one-dimensional polarization helix structure, under the presence of an external magnetic field, and show its influence on the spin density. The polar angle of the momentum space spin density becomes quantized in the regime that the Berry phase is quantized, as a result of the combined effect of the induced spin-orbit coupling and the external transverse magnetic field, while the edge states do not show the polar angle quantization, in contrast with the bulk states. Under appropriate conditions, the model can be generalized to have similarities with a chain with non-homogeneous Rashba spin-orbit couplings, with zero or low energy edge states. Due to the breaking of time-reversal symmetry, we recover the effect of chiral induced spin polarization and spin transport across the chiral chain, when coupling to external leads. Some consequences of the quantized spin polarization and low energy states on the spin transport are discussed.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nChiral structures have attracted considerable interest. Examples are chiral magnets, chiral metals or chiral molecules, for instance in the context of chiral induced selective spin transport1. Molecules such as DNA or similar structures, either single stranded or doubly stranded, have been studied2\u201314. Even though some controversy is still unresolved on a proper description of the large effect found experimentally for the spin polarization through specific chiral structures14, there is a variety of proposals, from an effect due to the spin of the electrons2\u201310, due to an orbital contribution15, or due to a mixture of both12. The requirement of time-reversal symmetry breaking is implemented in different ways, either through an explicit model without this symmetry (as effectively initial models considered) or through the effect of an external magnetic field, via non-unitary effects11, coupling to orbital degrees of freedom12 or taking into account effects of interactions16. Synthetic structures with intrinsic or applied chiral electric fields may also be of interest.\nThe chiral structure may arise due to a twisting polarization (and associated twisting electric field) along the molecule, such as in the DNA-type molecule or in bent-core molecules17\u201320 in the context of liquid crystals. The interest is in the electronic response to the presence of this chiral structure and it may be relevant when the electronic density and mobility are significant. While in equilibrium an effect is not expected, the chiral molecule affects the spin density of a moving electron when attaching leads at the extremes of the structure.\nOne considers therefore an electron moving in the presence of a twisting electric field that couples to the spin and leads to a non-homogeneous spin-orbit like effect. Typically, the models considered have a gapless structure that may be changed by adding gaps to the system, either adding a magnetic field (which naturally breaks time reversal invariance and may lead to spin transport) or introducing some form of distortion of the lattice (like\nin the SSH model21), adding local potential energy terms that separate the energies of the various lattice sites inside the unit cell of the helix-like structure.\nA question that may arise is whether the considered systems may exhibit a topological nature. The change from a gapless to a gapped regime will possibly facilitate the emergence and analysis of possible topological nontrivial states. In a gapless regime, edge states are usually not found, even though exceptions have been identified in gapless critical systems22,23. In a gapped regime edge states may appear, and one may wonder if signals of their presence will be felt on spin transport. One may also ask how the spin density and spin polarization are affected. The presence of the terms that lead to a gapped system, such as the addition of an external magnetic field or the lattice distortion, may change the symmetry of the problem, and the possible edge states may be zero energy modes or finite energy modes24,25. The appearance of topology in the context of chiral molecules has been proposed before15, including as a result of a time-dependent perturbation26,27.\nIn this work we consider electronic states that propagate along a chiral chain, in a way similar to previous treatments. An example is a helix composed of molecules or atoms that display polarization and an associated electric field, E. As an electron propagates along the helix, the electric field twists in a helical arrangement. This is, in general, a three-dimensional process. The polarization profile gives rise to an electric field that also has an helix-like structure, as shown in Fig. 1. The helix may be divided in unit cells with \u03b3 atoms that are displaced along the axis of the helix, z-axis, by an amount \u2206z = b/\u03b3, where b is the helix pitch. The radius of the helix is a. In Fig. 1 the helix is represented for the case of \u03b3 = 4.\nHere, to simplify, we consider one-dimensional rods, that are immersed in the three-dimensional structure. At each molecule or atom location in a given unit cell, m,\nar X\niv :2\n20 8.\n10 80\n7v 1\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .m\nes -h\nal l]\n2 3\nA ug\n2 02\n2\n2\nthere is a polarization given by\nP(\u03b1) = ( P cos 2\u03c0\n\u03b3 \u03b1, P sin\n2\u03c0\n\u03b3 \u03b1, 0\n) (1)\nwhere \u03b1 = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03b3 labels each atom within the unit cell. The problem is simplified considering an electron that moves in the direction of the axis of the helix and, therefore, we restrict its momentum to the z direction. In this simplification the momentum of the electron is k = kez. Due to the presence of the electric field, the electron feels in its reference frame an effective magnetic field in the x\u2212 y plane, that couples to the electron spin through a Zeeman-like effect. There is therefore a spinorbit-like contribution to the Hamiltonian of the electron of the form HSO = \u03bb\u03c3 \u00b7 (k\u00d7E), where \u03bb parametrizes the amplitude of the spin-orbit-like coupling. The chiral nature of the electric field configuration is therefore encoded in this spin-orbit term. A term like this has been shown to give rise to spin selective transport across a chiral molecule, if time reversal symmetry is broken. In this work we add an external magnetic field. We show that electronic bands arise with a gapped structure and with non-trivial quantized Berry (Zak) phases28, under some conditions. We calculate the spin density and show some quantization of the spin density direction when the Berry phase is quantized, either taking the average of the spin density on momentum space eigenstates or taking the average over real space bulk states . In general, there are edge states of finite energy that, however, do not show\nspin density quantization. We consider some generalizations of the model that give origin to additional topological zero energy edge states, in the absence of magnetic field. These are however shifted to finite, small, energies when the magnetic field is applied. It turns out that the quantization of the Zak phase is lost in some of the generalized models. The model without magnetic field or lattice distortion is topological and in class CII, but is gapless. Adding the lattice distortion the model is still topological and becomes gapped. Adding the magnetic field the model symmetry changes to class C, which is not topological in 1d. Combining the effects of the lattice distortion and the magnetic field, the model has no time-reversal symmetry and displays finite energy edge states. The various cases will be detailed ahead. Coupling the chiral structure to external leads, a spin polarization is found considering the cases when there is time-reversal symmetry breaking. Some enhancement of the spin polarization is found at low energies due to the egde states and in the regime where the Berry phase is quantized, associated with the preferred spin density direction.\nIn Section II we consider a tight-binding model with spin-orbit coupling and external magnetic field and study its energy spectrum and symmetries, calculate the Berry phase of the energy bands and determine the conditions for its quantization. In Section III we calculate the momentum space spin density and associate a quantization property with the quantization of the Berry phase. In Section IV a real-space description is adopted to determine the edge states and the real space spin density. In Section V we consider some generalizations of the model that lead to zero energy or low energy edge modes. In Section VI we study the spin transport along the system, coupling the chain to leads."

(\u00b5,w,B, \u03bbE have energy units). The amplitude\nof the electric field is taken as E = \u221a E2x + E 2 y = 1. Also,\nwe have added a local external magnetic field, B, that couples to the spin density of the electrons. This term explicitly breaks time reversal invariance and allows the opening of gaps between the bands. Also, it allows the study of the effect of time-reversal symmetry breaking on a multiband fermionic system25.\nIf the chiral chain is finite the electric field amplitude is not a constant. In order to simplify the problem we consider a long chain and neglect the effect of the ends of the chain by considering a constant amplitude throughout. We take w = 1, \u00b5 = 0. Also, in a more realistic model there is coupling between sites j and j + \u03b3, which we neglect here, as well as the three-dimensional motion of the electrons along the structure. In addition, we consider a simplified model of one orbital state in which the hopping term is a constant and consider that the effect of the twist along the helix only affects the spin-orbit term4,7.\nThe effects of a spin-orbit interaction in multiband systems have been extensively studied in the context of topological insulators30\u201332 focusing mainly on homogeneous spin-orbit terms. Non-homogeneous (or modulated) spin-orbit terms have also been considered such as due to a curved wire33 or in the generalized AubryAndre\u0301 class34. Here we focus on a spin-orbit interaction that encodes the chirality of the polarization or electric field configuration.\nThe explicit construction of the states is obtained diagonalizing the Hamiltonian in real space for a finite helix using open boundary conditions, giving both the bulk states and edge states. Considering an infinite helix we may use a momentum space description, with a basis of size \u03b3. The Hamiltonian in momentum space is a (\u03b3 \u00d7 2) \u00d7 (\u03b3 \u00d7 2) matrix that gives rise to \u03b3 \u00d7 2 electronic bands. In the case of \u03b3 = 2 the electric field has a staggered structure and so we consider higher values of \u03b3.\nLet us consider explicitly, as an example, the case of \u03b3 = 4. In this case the Hamiltonian matrix in momentum space is written in a basis of vectors (1 \u2191, 1 \u2193, 3 \u2191, 3 \u2193, 2 \u2191 , 2 \u2193, 4 \u2191, 4 \u2193)T .

Since CT = \u2212C the model is in class C, which in one dimension is predicted to be non-topological35.

The bands have either a \u03c0 Berry phase or a Berry phase of zero. In panel c), since the bands have degenerate points, the Berry phases indicated are for groups of two bands. In panels a) and b) the Berry phases are not quantized and have arbitrary real values.\ncharge conjugation symmetries28,36, ensures a quantization of the Berry phase. This is calculated mod(2\u03c0) and a trivial band has zero Berry phase and a topological band has a Berry phase of \u03c0. The Berry phase of a given band may be calculated in a standard way36\u201339. One divides the Brillouin zone considering N discrete points, k \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0], with momenta taking the values k1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , kN . The band\u2019s Berry phase \u03b3B may be obtained defining the link variable U(kl) = \u03d5\n\u2217(kl)\u03d5(kl+1), and summing over kl as\n\u03b3B = \u2212i \u2211 l logU(kl) (8)\nwhere \u03d5(kl) are the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian in momentum space.\nThis procedure can be generalized if there are degenerate points between the bands taking a link variable as U(kl) = detU(kl), involving the determinant of the matrix\nUij(kl) = \u03d5 \u2217 i (kl)\u03d5j(kl+1) (9)\nwhere 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 N run over the eigenstates and \u03d5i(kl) is the eigenstate at momentum kl of the ith band.\nIn Fig. 2 we show the energy bands and non-trivial (quantized) Berry phases, considering a unit cell with four sites, \u03b3 = 4. With no spin-orbit coupling (zero electric field) or zero external magnetic field, the bands are gapless (as shown in Fig. 2(a),(b) ) and the Berry phases are not quantized. Combining the two effects, in some regimes gaps appear between the various bands. The charge-conjugation symmetry implies that there are pairs of states that are related by n(k) \u2192 \u2212 m(\u2212k), where n,m are two bands. In Fig. 2(c) we consider the addition of a magnetic field along the x direction. Some gaps appear and the bands appear in groups of two. The sum of the Berry phases of the two lowest bands adds to \u03c0 as well as the sum of all following pairs of bands. We show in Fig. 2(d) an example of a situation where the various bands are separated by finite gaps as a result of adding a magnetic field Bz different from zero. The results for the Berry phases show that some bands are trivial and four bands are non-trivial, with a Berry phase \u03b3B = \u03c0. Note that the Berry phases of all the bands below zero energy add to zero, as a consequence of the charge-conjugation symmetry. Also, even though the model is in class C, which is not topological in the usual scheme, the Berry phases of individual bands show quantization properties.\nAs mentioned above, the quantization of Berry phase may result from inversion symmetry, chiral symmetry or charge-conjugation symmetry36. The helix structure and the presence of a magnetic field along x and z directions implies no inversion symmetry. In the presence of a magnetic field, B 6= 0 there is no chiral symmetry. However, there is a hidden symmetry if By = 0 (for \u03b3 = 4). It is of the type Oh(k)O\u22121 = \u2212h(\u2212k), and may se seen as a combination of inversion symmetry Ih(k)I\u22121 = h(\u2212k)\nand chiral symmetry \u03a0h(k)\u03a0\u22121 = \u2212h(k) specifically O = \u03c32 \u2297 \u03c31 \u2297 \u03c32. The various symmetries chiral symmetry, hidden symmetry and charge-conjugation symmetry also only hold if the chemical potential vanishes and the number of occupied bands equals the number of unnoccupied bands. There is a relation between the Zak phase, the electric polarization (dipole moment) and Wilson loops36,37,40,41. Using the symmetry properties of the Wilson loops and its relation to the dipole moment, p,36 as the sum of the eigenvalues of the Wilson loop via the Wannier centers (phases of the eigenvalues of the Wilson loop), it can be shown that, in the presence of inversion symmetry, the dipole moment (normalized to 1) of the states summed over the occupied bands, satisfies pocc = \u2212pocc implying that it is quantized to 0, 1/2, which leads to a Zak phase of 0, \u03c0. A similar analysis if there is a chiral symmetry leads to the result that pocc = punnocc, since the chiral symmetry connects states with positive energy with states with negative energy. Using the general result that pocc + punnocc = 0 (summing over all bands topology is trivial) we get the same result that pocc = \u2212pocc and, therefore, it is quantized. A similar result may be shown for charge-conjugation symmetry36. In the case of the hidden symmetry we get that pocc = \u2212punnocc since this symmetry changes the sign of the momentum and relates the positive energy states with the negative energy states. So, at first sight, no conclusion about the quantization may be obtained. At zero chemical potential the charge-conjugation symmetry is present (even in the presence of a magnetic field) and there is quantization of the Berry phase, considering the sum over the occupied bands. Indeed, we find, by explicit calculation of the Berry phases, that the sum over the lower four bands always leads to a zero Berry phase. It is quantized but topologically trivial. This is consistent with the class C, which is not topological in 1d. As mentioned above, if By = 0 we find that some of the bands, or groups of bands, show a quantized \u03c0 Berry phase. Adding By 6= 0 all the bands show non-quantized\nBerry phases, but are such that the sum over the occupied bands still yields a quantized, vanishing Berry phase, as imposed by the charge-conjugation symmetry. Even though the charge-conjugation and the hidden symmetry only hold if the chemical potential vanishes, it turns out that a finite chemical potential placed in a gap between the bands leads to a Berry phase of each band that is the same as for \u00b5 = 0. As a consequence, it is possible to select the chemical potential such that the sum of the Berry phases over the set of occupied bands is topologically non-trivial and quantized to \u03c0. This only takes place if By = 0, and therefore we argue that the quantization of the Berry phase is associated with the hidden symmetry, since the charge-conjugation symmetry implies pocc = punnocc and the hidden symmetry implies pocc = \u2212punnocc.\nThe non-trivial Berry phase found for \u03b3 = 4 can be generalized to any number of points in the unit cell. Recalling that in the rest frame of an electron the effect of the electric field can be seen as an effective magnetic field, b, that couples to the electron spin via a Zeeman coupling, we can see that the effective field has components b \u223c (\u2212Ey, Ex, 0). We can see that at site j of the unit cell, by/bx = \u22121/ tan[\u03a6 (j \u2212 1)], with \u03a6 = 2\u03c0/\u03b3. We have found that the condition for a non-trivial Berry phase can be obtained selecting\nBy Bx = 1 tan \u03a6 (10)\nIn a more general case, for which\nEy Ex = tan (\u03a6 + \u03b41) (11)\nwith \u03b41 any phase, we find that the Berry phase is quantized if we take\nBy Bx = 1 tan (\u03a6 + \u03b42) (12)\n6 with \u03b42 = \u2212\u03b41 \u00b1 l\u03c0, with l an integer. We also find regimes of quantized Berry phases for a model of spinless electrons but with a non-trivial hopping structure, due to the presence of more than one orbital state, and considering both nearest neighbor and next-nearest neighbor terms (with a complex part) and therefore an external magnetic field is not required. This is shown in Appendix A."

We will show that when the Berry phase is quantized, the polar angle gets quantized as a function of momentum.\nIn Fig. 3 we show the results for the spin density average as a function of momentum for the various bands for a unit cell of four sites. We consider the spin densities along the x and z directions. Also, we compare the results for a system which shows a quantized Berry phase and one which is not quantized. The results are in general similar, since the trivial regime is obtained adding a small magnetic field along the y direction.

This result holds for any unit cell size, \u03b3. The angle with respect to the z axis shows no quantization.\nIn Fig. 3 and in Fig. 4(a) we consider the case where\n7\nBz 6= 0. This was chosen earlier since applying a magnetic field in the parallel and transverse directions, with respect to the chiral axis, allows a simplified problem where all bands are separated by gaps. As shown in Fig. 2(c), turning off Bz leads to the closing of some gaps, even though a quantized Berry phase is still found for groups of two bands. Turning off Bz we find that the polar angle is also quantized. In Fig. 4(b) we compare the cases of Bz = 1.5 and Bz = 0, for \u03b3 = 4, which shows the quantization in both cases. In Fig. 4(c) we show the quantization of the polar angle for \u03b3 = 3 when Bz = 0. The case of vanishing Bz will be considered later in the spin transport across the helix.\nWe summarize the results for the Berry phase, \u03b3B , and the polar angle, \u03c6(k, n)/\u03c0, for each band, n, in Table I for \u03b3 = 3, 4, 5, 6 and Bz = 1.5. We see that for the lowest energy levels the spin density is aligned along B while for the higher levels the spin density is aligned along the B + \u03c0 direction. In the intermediate levels the spin density is aligned in one or the other direction depending on the momentum value, k. There is a competition between the external magnetic field and the effective field that is the result of the electric field of the helix. In the non-quantized cases this leads in general to a polar angle that varies with the momentum and band, while in the quantized Berry phase cases the polar angle has plateaus. In some cases the competition between the two magnetic fields leads to a situation where for a given band there is only one plateau. This happens for the lowest and/or the highest energy bands."

There are states inside the gaps, but there are no zero energy states. In non-chiral multiband systems the Zeeman term has a similar effect25,42. Recall that the sum of the Berry phases of the bands below zero energy is zero, consistently with no edge states in the gap surrounding zero energy. The states inside the gaps are well localized, as shown in Fig. 5(b) by the participation ratio of each level and by the wave functions shown in Fig. 5(c), that are well localized at the edges of the chain.

We may argue that the edge states appear in cases where the sum of the Berry phases below a given gap is non-trivial (this is particularly clear in the case that Bz = 0), as would be expected, even though the model is in class C. Even though this picture seems appealing, it turns out that the edge states remain in some cases, even when the Berry phase is not quantized to zero or \u03c0.

This contrasts with the result that the edge states do not display this quantization. This is shown in Fig. 7 where the po-\nlar angle of each eigenstate is shown, together with the participation ratios, for \u03b3 = 3. While the bulk states display the expected quantization, the edge states, identified by the small participation ratios, do not lead to a quantized polar angle."

            "text": "It is interesting to consider generalizations of the model. We may consider that along the helix some dimerization, trimerization, etc, may occur, that leads to a non-homogeneous set of hopping terms between the various neighbors. For instance, a unit cell with two sites, \u03b3 = 2, which may be dimerized, or a unit cell with \u03b3 = 3 which may be trimerized in some way. The first case is similar to a SSH model (with spin added). The model by itself has a topological regime, with zero energy edge states, quantized winding number and quantized Berry phase.\nFor instance, taking \u03b3 = 2, if the two hoppings t1, t2 are not equal, topology emerges if t2 > t1. Including spin in a SSH model, the bands become degenerate, but considering a magnetic field along the direction of the chain, Bz 6= 0 lifts the degeneracy and one finds the expected topological bands with \u03c0 Berry phase. Adding the spin-orbit term that results from the chiral structure, the topology is maintained, and due to the spin-orbit coupling a transverse spin density along the y direction is found. This leads naturally to a quantization of the polar angle along either \u03c6 = \u03c0/2 or 3\u03c0/2.\nTaking \u03b3 = 3 and selecting the three hoppings such\n0 0.5\n1\n0 0.5\n1\n0 0.5\n1\n0 0.5\n1\n\u03c6/ \u03c0\n0 0.5\n1\n-1 -0.5 0 0.5 1 k/\u03c0\n0 0.5\n1\nn=1\nn=2\nn=3\nn=4\nn=5\nn=6\u03bb=1\n(b)\nFIG. 8: a) Energy bands of a chain with \u03b3 = 3 and nonhomogeneous hoppings, with t1 = t2 = 1, t3 = 2, for different values of spin-orbit coupling \u03bb = 0, 0.1, 1. b) Quantization of the polar angle as a function of momentum, for topological case, for each band, for \u03b3 = 3 and \u03bb = 1.\nthat t3 > t1, t2, a non-trivial quantized spin polar angle is found. Unexpectedly, for t3 < t1, t2 a quantized polar angle is also found, even though the Berry phase vanishes (as expected for a trivial regime of a trimerized band). If t1 = t2 = t3 there is no induced spin density in the transverse directions and therefore there is no quantization of the polar angle, since it is ill-defined. These results are shown in Fig. 8 where we show the topological bands and the quantization of the polar angle when the spinorbit term is present. The spin-orbit coupling induces a transverse spin density and a quantization of the polar angle, even without the presence of an external transverse magnetic field (a field along z splits the bands). If t3 6= t1 = t2, we get in general non-trivial Berry phases, if a spin-orbit coupling term is present. In Fig. 9 we show the Berry phase (normalized by 2\u03c0) as a function of t3i and \u03bb, for zero transverse magnetic field but with Bz finite, showing the regimes where a non-trivial phase is found. The spin-orbit coupling term acts as an effective non-local magnetic field (depends on momentum), and tends to align the spin density. With t3 = t1 = t2 the spin-orbit coupling does not lead to non-trivial Berry phases, unless we add an external transverse magnetic\n10\nfield with the appropriate direction. With \u03bb = 0 the addition of a field Bx 6= 0 (and By satisfying the quantization condition, Eq. (10)), also leads to a quantized non-trivial Berry phase if t3 > t1, t2. With t3 6= t1 = t2, and with the spin-orbit term, we get in general an alignment of the spin density.\nWe remark, however, that there is no spin polarization in spin transport if B = 0 since time reversal is preserved, even though a spin density is created as a consequence of the spin-orbit coupling. The spin density of an incoming spin up or spin down electron is rotated, but in such a way that there is no difference between the two incoming electrons.\nA related model with time reversal symmetry has been considered34 that includes Rashba, \u03bbR, and Dresselhaus, \u03bbD, spin-orbit couplings. The Dresselhaus is uniform and the Rashba has a constant term plus a modulated one, that can be argued to be in the class of a generalized Aubry-Andre\u0301-Harper model. There are several phases with winding number (chiral symmetry) and gapless critical surfaces/lines and zero energy states. Inspired by these results we consider adding to the expression for \u03c7(j) of our model Eq. 2 a constant \u2212Ey term, independent of the site, j, and a Rashba-like term that results from a constant Ex. Adding for instance a spatially uniform Rashba-like term, with an amplitude \u03bbR, leads to some consequences that will be explored in the next section. If \u03bb and \u03bbR are not simultaneously small, one finds zero energy states if there is no external magnetic field. A term that may originate from a uniform electric field along \u2212y, may be considered with an amplitude \u03bb\u2032. In the case of zero external magnetic field and \u03b3 = 4, the spectrum remains gapless around zero energy if \u03bbR = \u03bb\n\u2032 but there are two gaps between bands two and three and between bands six and seven. If \u03bbR 6= \u03bb\u2032 a gap opens around zero energy. If \u03bbR > \u03bb\n\u2032 there are edge states inside the three gaps with the appearance of zero energy states. Applying an external magnetic field the zero energy states turn into finite energy but are still well localized on the edges\nof a finite system, if the magnetic field is small enough.\nTerms of the type of a SSH model lead to zero energy states, in addition to the finite energy edge states found in the helix problem. The model with Rashba coupling34 also leads to zero energy states (if B = 0). Adding Bx, the zero energy states in the gap acquire a small finite energy, but the states remain in the gap that is centered around zero energy. These states may contribute to either the low energy conductance or spin response when the system is coupled to external leads. A significant effect is found if there is a small coupling to the leads and a not too small or too large system (see for instance,43,44). This will be considered next."

This implies, when time reversal symmetry is broken, a spin polarization on the right lead.\nWe consider a one-dimensional problem that allows the propagation along the two spin channels. The chiral region is of finite size. Due to the spin-orbit coupling and the transverse external fields we must allow for spin flips. The scattering states may be reflected or transmitted along the chiral region, keeping the same spin component or reversing the spin component. In general we have a 2 \u00d7 2 matrix structure, respecting to the two spin projections. The scattering states propagate along the chiral region.

In\n12\nthe following we consider that Bz = 0 and only consider the action of a transverse magnetic field. In Fig. 10 we present results for the spin polarization and the charge diferential conductances, \u03c3\u2191, \u03c3\u2193 for a chiral chain with 10 cells with a unit basis of four atoms, \u03b3 = 4. As discussed in Appendix B, the effect of any edge states is lost if the chain is large enough, since they decay exponentially towards the interior of the chain. Also, the size of the hopping from the leads to the chiral chain has to be chosen appropriately. We compare the situations when the Berry phase is quantized and when it is trivial. The trivial cases are obtained either adding a Rashba term or considering By 6= 0. In a) and b) two different values of Bx are considered. As Bx increases from Bx = 0.5 to Bx = 1, the spin polarization increases in magnitude\nand the gap centered around zero energy also increases. Adding a constant Rashba term in c) increases the gap and comparing b) with d) we see that adding a small By = 0.2 does not affect significantly the spin polarization. Note that the various peaks of the spin polarization correlate well with the peaks in the conductances.\nIn Fig. 10(c) a finite Rashba coupling, \u03bbR = 2, is added. This leads, in the finite chiral chain uncoupled to the leads, to the presence of zero energy edge states if Bx = 0, that have a finite energy since Bx 6= 0. Since Bx is large in this case, the state energy is close to the gap and its effect is not seen. In Fig. 11 we consider a smaller value of Bx = 0.1 and its presence is clearly seen in the spin polarization at a small energy inside the gap, of the order of 5 \u00d7 10\u22122. The contribution of the edge states to the differential conductances is however small, and we need to lower the coupling to the leads, V , to see their effect, as shown in Appendix B. In addition to the oscillation in the spin polarization near zero energy, the peaks of the spin polarization correlate well with the peaks of the conductances, as in the previous figure. In Fig. 12 it is shown that the peaks of the differential conductances are located at the eigenenergies of the finite size chiral chain, uncoupled to the leads, with open boundary conditions. Recall that the energy considered is not an eigenenergy of the junction and indeed the states are scattering states. Still the resonance with the eigenstates of the uncoupled chain is clearly seen.\nThe results in Fig. 10 show that the spin polarization is not significantly affected by the Berry phase quantization, even though its effect is felt in the polar angle of the spin density in the chiral chain, both in momentum space and in real space. However, let us analyze the situation in some detail. In Fig. 13 we consider a chain with \u03b3 = 3. The quantized Berry phases are found imposing the condition Eq. (10). A simple trivial case is obtained taking By = 0. The top panels of Fig. 13 refer to a quantized Berry phase and the lower panels to the trivial case. In Fig. 13(a),(c) we show the differential conductances and the spin polarization and in Fig. 13(b),(d) we show the angles \u03b8 and \u03c6 of the spin density at the right end of the chiral chain. The energies for which \u03b8 < \u03c0/2 (\u03b8 > \u03c0/2) correspond to the regimes where the spin polarization is positive (negative), as expected. Comparing the structure of the conductance peaks we see a similar structure for the quantized and trivial cases (and similar behaviors for the spin polarization) even though it may be argued that in the quantized case the behavior is somewhat more regular. This is emphasized considering the energy dependence of the angles \u03b8, \u03c6 where a sharper behavior is found in the quantized (topological) case.\nA spin polarization that is nearly periodic in the incident energy, may be obtained symmetrizing the spinorbit coupling (considering equal Rashba, \u03bbR, and \u03bb\n\u2032 constant terms, which leads to a gapless spectrum around zero energy) and symmetrizing the transverse external magnetic field (taking Bx = By 6= 0). In Fig. 14 we consider two examples that show a rather regular se-\n13\nquence of energy peaks in the differential conductances (and their energy spacings), that lead to a regular set of oscillations and amplitudes of the energy dependent spin polarization. We consider \u03b3 = 4, V = 0.5 and take Bx = By = 0.1. Considering a chain with 10 unit cells the example shown considers \u03bb = 2, \u03bbR = \u03bb\n\u2032 = 3 and considering 20 unit cells we take \u03bb = 3, \u03bbR = \u03bb\n\u2032 = 4. We see that increasing the system size the polarization is very nearly periodic."

            "text": "The spinful electronic states of the multiband chiral chain, with a unit cell of size \u03b3, are the result of the electric field/electric polarization felt by a moving electron that is seen, in the reference frame of the electron, as a modulated spin-orbit coupling. The spectrum is in general gapless.\nOne way to split the levels is to apply an external magnetic field. Applying a field along z partially lifts the degeneracy and adding a field in the plane transverse to the chain axis, lifts the degeneracies of all bands, giving origin to a gapped system. Turning off Bz, it is also possible to obtain a gapped system in which the bands are\ngrouped in pairs. One advantage of applying the magnetic field is that it breaks time reversal invariance and allows the possibility of spin transport. Another possible outcome is the possibility of non-trivial topological states as a result of gap openings.\nUnder appropriate circumstances the gapped system has bands with quantized Berry phases of either individual bands or, in the case of Bz = 0, of pairs of bands. This suggests a topological nature of the bands, in these regimes. The topological character is also revealed by the quantization of the polar angle of the spin density. If the Berry phase is not quantized the polar angle is also not quantized. This is also found diagonalizing the problem in real space, with open boundary conditions, since the polar angle of the spin density averaged over a (bulk) eigenstate of the finite chain is also quantized. We have argued that the quantization of the Berry phase in the case of \u03b3 = 4 may be associated with a (hidden) symmetry that is the product of an inversion symmetry and a chiral symmetry, even though these symmetries are absent separately. Edge states are found, displaying very low participation ratio and well localized wave functions on the edges of a finite chain. However, these edge states have finite energies and not zero energy. Moving away from the quantized conditions for the Berry phase and the\n14\nspin polar angle, we also find edge states. A difference is found that in the quantized Berry phase regime the edge states appear in pairs that are energy degenerate, while in the trivial regime the states are no longer degenerate and either appear as a single state (as for \u03b3 = 3) or as consecutive energy states with a finite energy separation (as for \u03b3 = 4), at least for the finite sizes considered. Another relevant difference is that if the system size is large enough, the polar angles of the spin density of the edge states are different from each other (between the two degenerate states) and are not quantized.\nThe gapless chiral model with no external magnetic field may be gapped adding a homogeneous Rashba-like term, revealing the existence of topology and localized zero energy edge states. Adding the external magnetic field to the chiral model with no Rashba-like term, the edge states remain but acquire a finite energy and under appropriate conditions the Berry phase is quantized. Combining the two effects of external magnetic field and Rashba-like term, the model is not topological in the conventional sense, the Berry phase is not quantized, but the edge states remain, both at small and finite energies, and time-reversal symmetry is broken. The breaking of\ntime-reversal symmetry allows a spin polarization in the transport along the chiral chain, and the vicinity to a topological phase leads to the existence of the low energy states in the gap.\nWe have also considered models where the lattice may be distorted that lead to gap openings in appropriate conditions. For instance, a unit cell with two sites, \u03b3 = 2, which may be dimerized, or a unit cell with \u03b3 = 3, which may be trimerized in some way. The first case is similar to a SSH model (including spin). The model by itself has a topological regime, with zero energy edge states, quantized winding number and quantized Berry phase. In the case of \u03b3 = 3 we showed explicitly that if in addition to the trimerization we add the spin-orbit coupling, even in the absence of an external transverse magnetic field (a field along z is useful to split the bands), a transverse spin density is induced and a quantization of the spin polar angle is found. We also found a quantized Berry phase for a model of electrons with no spin, but with a non-trivial hopping structure, due to the presence of more that one orbital state and considering both nearest neighbor and next-nearest neighbor terms (with a complex part), as shown in Appendix A.\nIn the case the Berry phase is quantized, the energy dependence of the spin polarization has a better defined structure in comparison to a general case with no Berry phase quantization. Adding a Rashba-like homogeneous spin-orbit term, the contribution of the near zero energy edge states leads to an increase of the low-energy spin polarization. Also, we found a nearly energy periodic structure for the spin polarization considering symmetric homogeneous couplings and a symmetric transverse transverse magnetic field.\nAs a final note the helix may also be seen as a ladder where one chain has spin up and the other spin down and it may be related to other models. Alternating spin up and spin down the helix is related to a Creutz ladder47,48: \u03b3 = 4 a staggered Creutz ladder with fluxes 0 and \u03c0. For \u03b3 = 3 trimerized ladder with fluxes 0, 2\u03c0/3, 2\u03c0/3, 0,\u22122\u03c0/3,\u22122\u03c0/3, 0."

            "text": "Another possibility that has been considered is to ignore the spin contribution and to look for an orbital origin15. In this context, at each molecule in the helix one considers different states associated with the orbital degrees of freedom. The chiral nature of the molecule is\n15\nimplemented introducing a twist (phase) in the hoppings between different orbitals of neighboring molecules. One may understand such a construction considering now that the electron actually moves along the helix and therefore has momentum components along the xy plane. Under the action of the electric field the effective magnetic field has now a z-component (along the axis of the helix) that may be seen as a flux that gives origin to an orbital effect (due to the corresponding vector potential) that may be incorporated as a Peierls factor in the effective hoppings between the molecules. To simplify one may just consider that at each molecule two states of orbital nature contribute.\nHere we disregard the spin content of the electrons and consider that at each location there are two states, labeled by ml = 1, 2. The Hamiltonian in real space is chosen as\nH = \u2211 j \u2211 ml (\u2212\u00b5+ \u2206(ml)) c\u2020j,mlcj,ml\n\u2212 t1 \u2211 j \u2211 ml ( c\u2020j,mlcj+1,ml + c \u2020 j+1,ml cj,ml ) \u2212 t\u22a5\n\u2211 j ( c\u2020j,2cj,1 + c \u2020 j,1cj,2 ) \u2212 t2\n\u2211 j ( c\u2020j+1,2cj,1 + c \u2020 j,1cj+1,2 ) \u2212 t2\n\u2211 j ( e\u2212i2\u03c0/\u03b3c\u2020j\u22121,2cj,1 + e i2\u03c0/\u03b3c\u2020j,1cj\u22121,2 ) (A1)\nThe local hopping between the two orbital states t\u22a5 lifts the degeneracy of the orbital bands, if large enough. Also, we consider \u2206(1) = \u22121,\u2206(2) = 1 and \u00b5 = 0. The action of the orbital chiral coupling, t2, is determinant. If the phase of the nearest-neighbor hopping t2 vanishes, the bands are gapless. In order to look for topological bands we focus on bands that have gaps. Taking t\u22a5 = 1 we get a set of bands as shown in Fig. 15. We consider,\nas an example, \u03b3 = 4 and therefore we have eight bands, since ml = 1, 2. The bands are separated by finite gaps. Some of the bands have finite Berry phases of \u03b3B = \u03c0."
