conclusion To conclude, this research paper explored the application of style transfer in computer vision using RGB images and their corresponding depth maps. Our proposed method incorporated depth maps and a heatmap of the RGB image to generate more realistic style transfer results. Our approach outperformed traditional neural style transfer methods in terms of producing more accurate color and style information. The proposed method can have significant applications in various areas, such as computer graphics and image editing, to improve the realism of generated images.
