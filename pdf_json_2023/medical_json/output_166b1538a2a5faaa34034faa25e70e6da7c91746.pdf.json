    "abstractText": "To maintain atrial function, ATP supply-to-demand matching must be tightly controlled. Ca can modulate both energy consumption and production. In light of evidence suggesting that Ca affects energetics through \u201cpush\u201d (activating metabolite flux and enzymes in the Krebs cycle to push the redox flux) and \u201cpull\u201d (acting directly on ATP synthase and driving the redox flux through the electron transport chain and increasing ATP production) pathways, we investigated whether both pathways are necessary to maintain atrial ATP supply-to-demand matching. Rabbit right atrial cells were electrically stimulated at different rates, and oxygen consumption and flavoprotein fluorescence were measured. To gain mechanistic insight into the regulators of ATP supply-to-demand matching in atrial cells, models of atrial electrophysiology, Ca cycling and force were integrated with a model of mitochondrial Ca and a modified model of mitochondrial energy metabolism. The experimental results showed that oxygen consumption increased in response to increases in the electrical stimulation rate. The model reproduced these findings and predicted that the increase in oxygen consumption is associated with metabolic homeostasis. The model predicted that Ca must act both in \u201cpush\u201d and \u201cpull\u201d pathways to increase oxygen consumption. In contrast to ventricular trabeculae, no rapid time-dependent changes in mitochondrial flavoprotein fluorescence were measured upon an abrupt change in workload. The model reproduced these findings and predicted that the maintenance of metabolic homeostasis is due to the effects of Ca on ATP production. Taken together, this work provides evidence of Ca \u201cpush\u201d and \u201cpull\u201d activity to maintain metabolic homeostasis in atrial cells.",

Ca2+ can modulate both energy consumption and production. In light of evidence suggesting that Ca2+ affects energetics through \u201cpush\u201d (activating metabolite flux and enzymes in the Krebs cycle to push the redox flux) and \u201cpull\u201d (acting directly on ATP synthase and driving the redox flux through the electron transport chain and increasing ATP production) pathways, we investigated whether both pathways are necessary to maintain atrial ATP supply-to-demand matching. Rabbit right atrial cells were electrically stimulated at different rates, and oxygen consumption and flavoprotein fluorescence were measured. To gain mechanistic insight into the regulators of ATP supply-to-demand matching in atrial cells, models of atrial electrophysiology, Ca2+ cycling and force were integrated with a model of mitochondrial Ca2+ and a modified model of mitochondrial energy metabolism. The experimental results showed that oxygen consumption increased in response to increases in the electrical stimulation rate. The model reproduced these findings and predicted that the increase in oxygen consumption is associated with metabolic homeostasis. The model predicted that Ca2+ must act both in \u201cpush\u201d and \u201cpull\u201d pathways to increase oxygen consumption. In contrast to ventricular trabeculae, no rapid time-dependent changes in mitochondrial flavoprotein fluorescence were measured upon an abrupt change in workload. The model reproduced these findings and predicted that the maintenance of metabolic homeostasis is due to the effects of Ca2+ on ATP production. Taken together, this work provides evidence of Ca2+ \u201cpush\u201d and \u201cpull\u201d activity to maintain metabolic homeostasis in atrial cells.\nKEYWORDS\natria, energetic balance, ATP, computational modeling, ATP supply\n1 Introduction\nThe atria conduct the electrical activity from the sinoatrial node to the heart\u2019s ventricles and both passively and actively enhance ventricular diastolic filling.

In addition, regulation of atrial energetics is not well understood.\nMitochondria are the main producers of ATP in atrial cells, and both Ca2+ and ADP have been suggested as key regulators of matching respiratory to energy supply to varying demands (Mason et al., 2020); yet their targets remain to be determined (Liberopoulos, 2013). ADP activates enzymes in the Krebs cycle, and thereby \u201cpushes\u201d the respiratory flux toward ATP generation (Harris and Das, 1991). In parallel, ADP controls ATP synthase by its availability, and thereby \u201cpulls\u201d ATP production by increasing respiratory flux (Chance and Williams, 1955). Activation of ATP synthase facilitates redox flux through the electron transport chain and increases ATP production. While Ca2+ is generally thought to act as a \u201cpush\u201d control over ATP production (Harris and Das, 1991), by activating metabolite flux and enzymes in the Krebs cycle to push the redox flux, accumulating evidence suggests its role as a \u201cpull\u201d regulator (Territo et al., 2000). Whether Ca2+ control of metabolism works via both \u201cpull\u201d and \u201cpush\u201d mechanisms in atrial cells under physiological conditions is not known. Moreover, while metabolic homeostasis in response to increased workload was shown in the heart (Balaban, 2012), it remains to be determined whether it is maintained in atrial cells in response to electrical stimulation.\nTo gain mechanistic insights into the regulators of such matching in atrial cells, this work constructed a computer model that integrated models of electrophysiology (Lindblad et al., 1996), Ca2+ cycling (Lindblad et al., 1996; Aslanidi et al., 2009) and force (Yaniv et al., 2006), to describe ATP demand, with a model of mitochondrial Ca2+ (Nguyen et al., 2007) and a modified model of mitochondrial energy metabolism (Cortassa et al., 2006). The integrated model was validated by conducting experiments measuring oxygen consumption and flavoprotein activity in response to increased electrical stimulation rates.\nWe hypothesized that: i) Ca2+ is an important regulator of ATP supply-to-demand matching, ii) Ca2+ both \u201cpulls\u201d and \u201cpushes\u201d ATP production and iii) metabolic homeostasis is maintained in atrial cells during increased electrical stimulation or abrupt changes in workload.\nBy combining experimental and computational results, we found ATP supply only matched the demand when Ca2+ both \u201cpulled\u201d and \u201cpushed\u201d ATP. Moreover, no rapid time-dependent changes in mitochondrial flavoprotein fluorescence level were observed in response to an abrupt change in workload, due to Ca2+ ion regulation of cell bioenergetics."

Created with BioRender.com.\nFrontiers in Physiology frontiersin.org03\n2.8.2 Modification in the model An ATP-dependent variable was added to the original uptake current of Ca2+ into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) equation in (Lindblad et al., 1996):\nIup Iup,max \u00b7 ATP[ ]i7.977 Ca2+[ ]i Kcy,Ca \u2212 K 2 xcs Ca 2+[ ]up Ksr,Ca\nCa2+[ ]i+Kcy,Ca Kcy,Ca + Kxcs Ca 2+[ ]up+Ksr,Ca( ) Ksr,Ca\n(1)\nwhere Iup,max is the maximal calcium uptake current into the SR, Kcy,Ca is the equilibrium binding Ca2+ concentration on the cytosolic side [[Ca2+]i) Ksr,Ca is the equilibrium binding Ca2+ concentration in the uptake compartment of the SR side, Kxcs is a translocation constant and [Ca2+]up is the Ca2+ concentration in the uptake compartment of the SR.\nBecause the force is described by four state that are affected by Ca2+, instead of on and off kinetics, the amount of bound Ca2+ to the tropomyosin is described by:\ndOTnCa dt Fkl Ca2+[ ]i 1\u2212A\u2212TT\u2212U( )+Fkl Ca2+[ ]iU\u2212TTK\u22121 \u2212AK\u22121 (2)\nwhere K-1 describes the dependence of Ca 2+ affinity on the number of strong cross-bridges and Fkl is the rate constant of calcium binding to low-affinity troponin sites. A is the density of regulatory units with bound Ca2+ and adjacent weak crossbridges. TT is the density of regulatory units with bound Ca2+ and adjacent strong cross-bridge. U is the density of regulatory units without bound Ca2+ but with adjacent strong cross-bridges.\nWe modified the energetics equation in (Cortassa et al., 2006) to include regulation by mitochondrial Ca2+ ([Ca2+]m), as suggested by (Harris and Das, 1991). Thus, the rate of pyruvate dehydrogenase cam be described by:\nVPDH kPDH \u00b7 CPYR \u00b7 Ca 2+[ ]m\nCa2+[ ]m + kCaAcCoA( ) (3) where kPDH is the catalytic constant of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), CPYR is the pyruvate concentration and kCaAcCoA is the Michaelis constant representing the regulatory effect of Ca2+ on PDH. The respiration-driven proton pump is based on (Cortassa et al., 2006), with the modification indicated below: Mitochondrial NAD+ is assumed to be conserved according to the following relation:\nNAD[ ] CPN \u2212 NADH[ ] (4) where CPN is the total sum of mitochondrial pyridine nucleotides.\nAresNADH RTF ln Kres NADH[ ] NAD[ ] \u221a\u239b\u239d \u239e\u23a0 (5) AresFLV RTF ln Kres FADH2[ ] FAD[ ]\n\u221a\u239b\u239d \u239e\u23a0 (6) FAD[ ] TotFAD \u2212 FADH2[ ], (7)\nwhere Kres is the equilibrium constant of respiration, [FADH2] is the concentration of reduced FAD, [FADH] is the concentration of oxidized FAD and TotFAD is the total concentration of FADH2 and FAD.\nAs the reducing reagents, FADH2 and NADH are created in the TCA cycle in a 1:4 ratio (FADH2:NADH) and we assume that their consumption by the electron transfer chain follows the same ratio. This means that 1/5 of oxygen consumption is attributed to FADH2fueled and 4/5 to NADH-fueled electron transfer cycles:\nAres 45Ares NADH + 1 5 Ares FLV (8)\nIn a modification of the original formulation in (Cortassa et al., 2006), it is also considered that the complex II electrons are input by SUC through FADH2 to the respiratory chain:\nAres F( ) RTF ln Kres F( ) FADH2[ ] FAD[ ] \u221a\u239b\u239d \u239e\u23a0 (9) VHe F( )\n4\u03c1res F( ) ra exp Ares F( )F RT( ) \u2212 ra + rb( ) exp g6F\u0394\u00b5HRT( )( )\n1 + r1 exp Ares F( )FRT( )( ) exp 6F\u0394\u03a8BRT( ) + r2 + r3 exp Ares F( )FRT( )( ) exp g6F\u0394\u00b5HRT( )( ) (10) The flux of protons driven by FADH2 oxidation (VHe(F)) has the same form as VHe, except for the adjustment of the redox potential and the H+ stoichiometry. \u03c1res(F) is the concentration of electron carriers (respiratory complexes II-III-IV) and Kres(F) is the equilibrium constant of FADH2 oxidation.\nThe regulation of oxidative phosphorylation by the cellular energy demands is modeled using a push and pull mechanism. ADP activates enzymes in the Krebs cycle, which \u201cpushes\u201d the respiratory flux toward ATP generation (Harris and Das, 1991). In parallel, ADP controls ATP synthase by its availability, thereby \u201cpulling\u201dATP production by increasing the respiratory flux (Chance and Williams, 1955):\npull VATPase kATPase\n(11)\nVO2 \u03c1respull ra + rc1 exp 6F\u0394\u03a8BRT( )( ) exp AresFRT( ) \u2212 ra exp g6F\u0394\u00b5HRT( ) + rc2 exp AresFRT( ) exp g6F\u0394\u00b5HRT( )( )\n1 + r1 exp AresFRT( )( ) exp 6F\u0394\u03a8BRT( ) + r2 + r3 exp AresFRT( )( ) exp g6F\u0394\u00b5HRT( )( ) (12)\nwhere rc1 and rc2 are the sum of products of rate constants, and kATPase is defined as the coupling coefficient representing the pull effect of the ATP synthase on the activity of the electron transfer chain.\nAccording to the concept of respiratory control, mitochondrial function is governed by the availability of ADP and Pi.

            "text": "Fundamental experiments were first performed to verify that an increase in electrical stimulus frequency increases ATP supply. In a fully coupled system, oxygen consumption is an indicator of ATP production, i.e., supply. Increases in stimulus frequency increased oxygen consumption and were statistically significant at 3 Hz compared to 1 Hz (Figure 2). Only the values of oxygen consumption at 1 Hz stimulus frequency were used as input to the computational model, and the predicted model values at 2 and 3 Hz stimulus frequency were compared to the experimental results (see below).\nUsing the computational model, we found that at 1 Hz st0069mulus frequency (Figure 3A), the SERCA pump (56.9%) and the myofilaments (43%) were the major ATP consumers, while maintenance of the membrane homeostasis (sodiumpotassium pump and Ca2+ pump) consumed only 0.05% of the ATP budget. By calculating the relative consumption of ATP by the above consumers we found that increasing the stimulus frequency to 2 Hz and 3 Hz increased the ATP consumption rate by the SERCA and sarcomeres, due to an increased uptake rate (Figure 3B, from 3.48 pA at 1 Hz to 3.81 pA and 4.3 pA at 2 Hz and 3 Hz, respectively), and in the case of force, increased average systolic force (Figure 3C, from 3.31 \u00b7 105 \u03bcNmm2 at 1 Hz to 3.34 \u00b7 105 \u03bcNmm2 and 3.53 \u00b7 105 \u03bcNmm2 at 2 and 3 Hz, respectively). Supplementary Figure S1 shows the ionic currents and pumps measured in response to increasing electrical stimulus rates. The model predicted that the increase in ATP demand was mainly due to an increase in the rate, and not amplitude, of the currents because the amplitude of the sodium-potassium pump and Ca2+ pump currents slightly decreased with increased stimulus frequency. On change of the stimulus frequency (2 Hz and 3 Hz), there was no change in the relative ATP consumption by the consumers compared to 1 Hz. Thus, the rate-dependent changes in contractility and Ca2+ handling are the same, likely because the majority of Ca2+ is bound to troponin."

Thus, we experimentally measured its kinetic under different electrical stimulation rates. We found that at 1 Hz, the t50 (50% decline time of the Ca2+ signal from the peak) was 166.8 \u00b1 168 ms and t90 (90% decline time of the Ca 2+ signal from the peak) was 407 \u00b1\nFrontiers in Physiology frontiersin.org05\n204 ms (n = 36 cells). At 3 Hz, t50 was 115 \u00b1 48 ms and t90 was 187 \u00b1 48 ms, n = 36 (Figure 3E). We then fitted the parameters of the model, including channel and transporter dynamics and conductance, enzyme kinetics and initial values of state variables, to achieve similar Ca2+ kinetics at a 1 Hz stimulus frequency. The parameters were selected to fulfill additional criteria, which included ensuring model non-divergence, TCA cycle stability, and maintaining all state variables within physiological ranges. At 1 Hz stimulus frequency, the model predicted a t50 of 145.2 ms and t90 of 423.2 ms, which were both in the range of the experimental values (Figure 3E). We compared the model predictions to the experimental measurements at 3 Hz. At 3 Hz stimulus frequency, the model predicted a t50 of 110.2 ms and t90 of 247.1 ms, which aligned with the experimental results. Note that small differences in t90 may be related to frequency-dependent influx and outflux kinetics of Ca2+ from the SR.\nIn the computational model, the increase in intracellular Ca2+ in response to an increase in stimulus frequency led to an accumulation of mitochondrial Ca2+ (Figure 4A, from 2.42 \u00b7 10\u22125mM at 1 Hz to 2.63 \u00b7 10\u22125mM and 2.81 \u00b7 10\u22125mM at 2 and 3 Hz, respectively).

FADH2 levels remained constant upon increase of stimulus frequency from 1 Hz to 3 Hz, in accordance with previous experimental results (Kirschner Peretz et al., 2017) (Figure 4E). Similarly, the computational model predicted that metabolic homeostasis of all Krebs cycle metabolites was maintained (Figure 5). Note that although metabolic homeostasis existed in steady state, effects of Ca2+ oscillation on alpha ketoglutarate, succinyl-CoA and succinate were observed (Figures 5D\u2013F). Yet, the oscillation amplitude was below the experimental detection level."

Figure 6 shows the simulated oxygen consumption (Figure 6A), FADH2 concentration (Figure 6B), intracellular (Figure 6C) and mitochondrial (Figure 6D) ATP levels in response to increasing stimulus frequencies.

However, when the ATP synthase pull mechanism was disabled prior to increased stimulus frequency, oxygen consumption did not change after reaching steady state (from 0.096mMms at 1 Hz to 0.101 mM ms and 0.103 mM ms at 2 and 3 Hz, respectively), excluding a transient effect at the beginning of the simulation, in contrast to experimental results. When both push and pull mechanisms were eliminated, no change in oxygen consumption was obtained (from 0.091mMms at 1 Hz to 0.091mMms and 0.091 mM ms at 2 Hz and 3 Hz, respectively), while mitochondrial ATP concentrations decreased and cellular ATP remained constant.

We reproduced these experiment with a similar protocol in rabbit atrial cells. (Figure 7). When the frequency was increased from 0.25 Hz to 2 Hz (96.8% \u00b1 5.6%) or when stimulus frequency was returned to 0.25 Hz after 2 Hz stimulation (95.2% \u00b1 4.2) (n = 5 cells), no measurable frequency-dependent change was observed in flavoprotein fluorescence (a reciprocal proxy of NAD). Our computational results showed that when the stimulus frequency was rapidly raised from 0.25 Hz to 2 Hz and then returned to 0.25 Hz, mitochondrial Ca2+ (Figure 8A from 2.38 \u00b7 10\u22125mM at 0.25 Hz to 2.67 \u00b7 10\u22125mM at 2 Hz), oxygen consumption (Figure 8D, from 0.105mMms at 0.25 Hz to 0.113mMms at 2 Hz) increased and decreased, respectively, but FADH2 (Figure 8C, from 5.414mM at 0.25 Hz to 5.417mM at 2 Hz) and NADH (Figure 8D, from 5.443mM at 0.25 Hz to 5.446mM at 2 Hz) levels were maintained.

This phenomenon was likely due to changes in the\nFrontiers in Physiology frontiersin.org07\nkinetics of Ca2+ uptake and release from the SR. This phenomenon was consistent in all Ca2+ compartments. Nevertheless, the behavior of Ca2+ on all components across frequencies was as expected; higher frequencies elevated the mean cytoplasmic and mitochondrial Ca2+ concentrations, creating a higher contraction force in the sarcomeres, which signaled the mitochondria that energy consumption increased.\nTo confirm that Ca2+ plays a vital role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis during rapid increases in ATP demand, we disabled Ca2+ activation in either the push or pull pathways.With the pull mechanism disabled, no change in oxygen consumption occurred (from0.096mMms at\n0.25 Hz to 0.102mMms at 2 Hz), but metabolic homeostasis existed.

The model predicted that increases in the electrical stimulation frequency increase ATP demand and mitochondrial Ca2+ in parallel to increased oxygen consumption. Clamping of mitochondrial Ca2+ resulted in the elimination of the coupling between stimulation rate and oxygen consumption, supporting\nthe first hypothesis that Ca2+ is an important regulator of ATP supply-to-demandmatching. In contrast to the experimental results, the model predicted that on elimination of the role of Ca2+ as a \u201cpull\u201d modulator, oxygen consumption does not increase in response to electrical stimulation, supporting the second hypothesis that Ca2+ acts both in \u201cpull\u201d and \u201cpush\u201d modules. Finally, both experimental evidence and model predictions showed no rapid time-dependent changes in mitochondrial flavoprotein fluorescence in response to abrupt or slow changes in workload, supporting the third hypothesis that metabolic homeostasis is maintained in atrial cells in response to abrupt or slow increases in workload.\nOur model predicted that Ca2+ is a key regulator of ATP supply-todemandmatching. At an increased workload, changes inmitochondrial Ca2+ were causally correlated with changes in oxygen consumption, while the other metabolites remained constant (i.e., showed no correlation with oxygen consumption). The comparison was enabled by novel oxygen consumption measurements, performed for the first time in isolated and electrically stimulated atrial cells. Ca2+ was regulated by both ATP supply and by the mitochondria that produce ATP. We simulated the two main ATP-consuming processes, both of which are Ca2+-dependent, i.e., pumping Ca2+ by the SERCA and force generation by myofilaments, to which the majority of Ca2+ is attached (Bers, 2002). Ca2+ enters themitochondria through themitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (Baughman et al., 2011; De Stefani et al., 2011) and activates energyrelated mechanisms, and is extruded by the mitochondrial Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (Palty et al., 2010). Eliminating the Ca2+ effect on ATP synthase (\u201cpull\u201d effect) diminished the correlation between mitochondrial Ca2+ and oxygen consumption. Moreover, without Ca2+ signaling, the metabolic homeostasis that we observed experimentally could not be maintained in the simulation. Thus, our\nFIGURE 7 Flavoprotein homeostasis in atrial cells.

The model was tested without Ca2+ push and pull mechanisms, with only Ca2+ push mechanism and with both Ca2+ push and pull mechanisms.\nFrontiers in Physiology frontiersin.org10\nresults and simulation indicate that within the simulated workload range, Ca2+ is an important regulator of ATP supply to demand in both \u201cpush\u201d and \u201cpull\u201dmodes in atrial cells, as has been previously shown in ventricular cells (Cortassa et al., 2006; Bertero and Maack, 2018) and in isolated cardiac mitochondria (Banien\u00eb and Milda\u017eien\u0117, 2005). Note that when both the \u201cpush\u201d and \u201cpull\u201d effects of Ca2+ were eliminated, ATP levels in the cytosol were still maintained in response to increases in workload, because presumably small changes in mitochondrial ADP pull the ATP synthase to increase ATP production. Thus, ADP is also an energy regulator in atrial cells.\nIt was postulated that \u201cpush\u201d and \u201cpull\u201d modules lead to temporal changes in NADH levels in response to changes in workload (Cortassa et al., 2006). The differences in the relative response times of these two processes account for the transient overshoot and undershoot behavior of mitochondrial NADH documented in ventricular trabeculae (Brandes and Bers, 2002). However, in the current work, while Ca2+ \u201cpush\u201d and \u201cpull\u201d effects were demonstrated in atrial cells, no transient overshoot or undershoot behavior was measured in response to change in overload. It is possible that different control mechanisms exist in atrial cells compared to the ventricle. Moreover, the experiments in ventricular trabeculae (Brandes and Bers, 2002) were performed at 22 \u00b0C, while the current work was conducted at 36 \u00b0C, which can result in different kinetics. Furthermore, it has been suggested that \u201cpush\u201d is a Ca2+-dependent mechanism while \u201cpull\u201d is only an ATP-related and not Ca2+-dependent mechanism (Cortassa et al., 2006). It should be noted that Balaban and co-workers did not observeNADH transients in response to increased workload in the intact heart (Balaban, 2002) or in isolatedmitochondria (Territo et al., 2001). Both here and in the isolated heart, the maintained metabolic homeostasis can be explained by the rapid increase in energy supply to meet energetic demands, triggered by fast parallel activation of the respiratory chain and Krebs cycle dehydrogenases by a cytoplasmic messenger, postulated here to be Ca2+. Note that based on the model, the changes in mitochondrial Ca2+ led to small changes (less than 2%) in the rate of tangible Ca2+dependent effects on the Krebs cycle.\nOur model faithfully reproduced experimental results. The model which was fitted on Ca2+ data measured under a 1 Hz stimulation rate, reproduced Ca2+ kinetics and oxygen consumption under a 3 Hz stimulation rate. The model also reproduced FADH2 homeostasis and predicted that metabolic homeostasis existed at all levels of bioenergetics, from the Krebs cycle enzymes to respiratory fluxes (Supplementary Figure S1). Note that all of our experiments were performed on rabbit cells, which exhibit excitation-contraction coupling mechanisms more similar to those of humans than mice, rats or guinea pigs (Bers, 2002). Although there are several promising computational models linking electrophysiology, ion homeostasis, Ca2+ handling, ATP consumption andmitochondrial energetics (Matsuoka et al., 2004; Cortassa et al., 2006; Yaniv et al., 2008), none of the models have been adjusted to atrial cells.\nThe model was developed to only consider supply-to-demand matching mechanisms working in a short window. It was shown before that several control mechanisms may work on a longer range (tens of seconds to minutes), such as CaMKII signaling (Yang et al., 2018) and the accumulation of intracellular sodium, which drive changes in Ca2+ handling via the sodium-calcium exchanger (Verkhratsky et al., 2018). Of note, even for short periods, there timing of activation of different mechanisms can differ; Ca2+ works on a beat-to-beat basis and was shown before to react faster than ADP to changes in demand (Cortassa et al., 2006)."

Alterations in Ca2+ handling have been correlated with AF (Dobrev and Nattel, 2008; Dobrev et al., 2011; Mason et al., 2020) and can lead to ATP supply-to-demand mismatch.

Additional experimental data on these signaling pathways will enable assessment of their relative role in ATP supply-to-demand matching.\nAlthough cytosolic Ca2+ was measured in atrial cells, mitochondrial Ca2+ kinetics was not quantified. Such data are lacking due to the challenges of measurement of Ca2+ kinetics under high electrical stimulation frequencies. New methods are needed to complete this task.\nThe present work assumes that creatine kinase (CK) concentration is constant and does not model the CK kinetics in two compartments as was done in (Cortassa et al., 2006). In mice, near-total knockout of mitochondrial and/or cytosolic CK isoforms had a modest but measurable effect on cardiac performance measurements under normal as well as increaseddemand conditions (Lygate et al., 2009; Lygate et al., 2013). Thus, under normal conditions the role of CK in ATP production is negligible. Future experiments will be necessary to understand the importance of the CK shuttle in ATP supply-to-demand matching in the atria.\nOur computational model represented only the control mechanisms that operate on a time scale of seconds. Electrical stimulation for several minutes may activate additional energy balance maintenance mechanisms. Of note, even for longer periods of electrical stimulation (1 minute) metabolic homeostasis was maintained experimentally (Kirschner Peretz et al., 2017).\nOne should also take into consideration that some control mechanisms, such as Ca2+, work on a beat-to-beat basis.
