Comparative Studies on ITC Variants and Bladder Cancer Subtypes: Conducting in-depth comparative studies of the effects of various ITCs (allyl-isothiocyanate, benzyl-isothiocyanate, and phenethyl-isothiocyanate) on different subtypes of bladder cancer cells. This research could provide insights into which specific ITCs are most effective against particular cancer subtypes, potentially leading to more targeted and effective therapeutic strategies.

Clinical Trials Integrating ITCs with Standard Chemotherapy: Initiating clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of integrating ITCs into standard chemotherapy regimens for bladder cancer. These studies could assess whether the addition of ITCs can enhance treatment outcomes, reduce resistance development, or mitigate side effects associated with conventional chemotherapy drugs like cisplatin and gemcitabine.

Mechanistic Studies on ITC-Induced Apoptosis and Cell Cycle Arrest: Conducting detailed mechanistic studies to elucidate the precise molecular pathways through which ITCs induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in bladder cancer cells. This could involve investigating the role of specific signaling pathways, such as PI3K/Akt/mTOR and CDK-cyclin axes, in mediating the effects of ITCs, as well as exploring potential differences in the mechanisms of action across different ITC compounds and cancer cell lines.

Investigation of ITCs on Metastasis and Invasion: Exploring the impact of ITCs on the metastatic and invasive capabilities of bladder cancer cells. This line of research could reveal whether ITCs can not only suppress tumor growth and proliferation but also inhibit the spread and invasion of cancer cells, thereby providing a more comprehensive anticancer effect.

Development of ITC-Based Drug Formulations: Researching and developing drug formulations that optimize the delivery and bioavailability of ITCs for bladder cancer treatment. This could include nanoparticle-based delivery systems, combination drug formulations, or novel administration routes that maximize the therapeutic potential of ITCs while minimizing toxicity and side effects.
