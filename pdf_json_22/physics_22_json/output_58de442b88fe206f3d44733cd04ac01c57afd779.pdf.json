    "abstractText": "In this article, a new concept of microwave photonic (MWP) fiber ring resonator is introduced. In particular, the complex transmission spectra of the resonator in the microwave domain, including magnitude and phase spectra, are measured and characterized. Multiple resonance peaks are obtained in the magnitude spectrum; rapid variations in phase near resonance (i.e., enhanced group delay) are observed in the phase spectrum. We also experimentally demonstrate that the MWP fiber ring resonator can be potentially employed as a novel optical fiber sensor for macro-bending and fiber length change sensing (strain sensing). The experimental results are in good agreement with theoretical predictions.",

            "text": "Optical ring resonators are critical optical devices and have found many important applications [1\u20134]. In recent years, optical-fiber-based ring resonators have attracted great interest and have been widely used in both passive and active optical devices, such as lasers [5], filters [6], and sensors [7\u201310]. Compared to on-chip micro-ring resonators, optical-fiber-based ring resonators are usually larger in size. However, optical-fiber ring resonators can be readily constructed using off-the-shelf optical-fiber components, e.g., fiber couplers, allowing systematic investigation of their optical characteristics [11,12]. A fiber ring resonator is typically characterized by measuring its intensity transfer function, which is accomplished by probing the resonator using a highly coherent light source. Importantly, the state of polarization of the probing light must be tightly controlled. Meanwhile, the wavelength of the probing light must be varied in a certain range to acquire the entire coherent transfer function at resonance. Additionally, the linewidth of the light source must be at least one order of magnitude smaller than the resonance width of the resonator, such that the resonance can be resolved. The requirement on the linewidth of the light source becomes a seriously limiting factor when it comes to a fiber ring resonator with a long cavity length [13]. To relieve the stringent requirement on the light source, optical time-domain reflectometry (OTDR) was reported as a complementary technique for the characterization of fiber ring resonators [13]. Microwave photonics (MWP), an emerging interdisciplinary subject, has undergone tremendous growth and advancements over the past two decades [14\u201316], and has found successful applications in signal generation [17], signal processing [18], as well as sensing [19,20]. Of particular relevance here, various fiber optic sensors based on different MWP interrogation methods were developed recently, such as MWP-filtering techniques [21\u201323], optical-carrier-based microwave interferometry [16,24], optoelectronic oscillators [25,26], phase-shift amplified interferometry [27,28], etc. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate MWP fiber ring resonators. Discrete resonance peaks can be observed in the transmission spectrum in the microwave domain of an MWP fiber ring resonator. Similar to opticaldomain ring resonators, rapid variations in phase near resonance are also observed in the\nSensors 2022, 22, 3771. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22103771 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 3771 2 of 8\nMWP fiber ring resonators, making them a potential platform for slow\u2013fast light investigation. Additionally, the capability of the MWP fiber ring resonator for potential sensing applications is also demonstrated."

After sweeping the microwav modulation fr quency and recording the corresponding magn tude and phase nformation at each of the discrete frequencies, the complex transmission spectrum of the fiber ring res nator in the microwave d ain can be obtained, i.e., S21 from the VNA. Note that essentially only a single optical-fiber coupler is required to form a fiber ring. However, in this work, two couplers were utilized because it is ore convenient to adjust the coupling coefficie ts of the fiber ring resonator, as illustrate later.

Importantly, in the MWP system, the length of the fiber ring (e.g., a few meters) is set to be sufficiently larger than the coherence length of the light source (on the order of mm) so that the cross-product term in Equation (2) approaches zero [29]. On the other hand, the self-product term in Equation (2) can be written as\n1 \u2206\u03c9 \u03c9max\u222b \u03c9min \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 N\u2211 i=1 Ei \u2223\u2223\u2223\u22232d\u03c9 = N\u2211 i=1 \u03c42i A2\n+ N \u2211\ni=1 \u03c42i A2M cos\n[ 2\u03c0 f (t + nL0+(i\u22121)nLc ) ] (4) After optoelectronic conversion (with a coefficient of g) and synchronized detection,\nthe total can be expressed as\nS = Ae f f cos(2\u03c0 f t + \u03c6e f f ) (5)\nwhere\nAe f f = g \u221a N \u2211\ni=1\nN \u2211\nj=1 \u03c42i\u03c42j M2 A4 cos\n[ 2\u03c0 f (i\u2212 j) nLc ]\n\u03c6e f f = tan\u22121 N \u2211 i=1 \u03c42i sin\n[ 2\u03c0 f nL0+(i\u22121)nLc ] N \u2211\ni=1 \u03c42i cos\n[ 2\u03c0 f nL0+(i\u22121)nLc\n] (6)\nThe magnitude spectrum Aeff essentially gives the transmission spectrum of the fiber ring resonator in the microwave domain. According to Equation (6), the phase-matching condition of the fiber ring resonator is given by\n2\u03c0 f nL c = 2k\u03c0, k = 1, 2, 3 . . . (7)\nTherefore, the free spectral range (FSR) of the MWP fiber ring resonator can be expressed as\nFSR = c\nnL (8)\nwhich is the same as conventional optical ring resonators. It is worth mentioning that the phase spectrum can also be measured using the VNA, from which the group delay of the signal can be obtained."
