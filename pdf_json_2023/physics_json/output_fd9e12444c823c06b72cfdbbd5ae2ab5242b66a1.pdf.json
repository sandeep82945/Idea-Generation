    "abstractText": "A series of calcium oxide\u2013magnesium oxide (CaO\u2013MgO) catalysts were prepared under the effects of different precipitating agents and using varied Mg/Ca ratios. The physiochemical characteristics of the prepared catalysts were analyzed using XRD, FE-SEM, BET, FTIR, and TG/DTA techniques. Quantification of basic active sites present on the surface of the CaO\u2013MgO catalysts was carried out using the Hammett indicator method. The as-prepared mixed oxide samples were tested for propylene carbonate (PC) synthesis through the alcoholysis of urea with propylene glycol (PG). The effects of the catalyst composition, catalyst dose, reaction temperature, and contact time on the PC yield and selectivity were investigated. The maximum PC yield of 96%, with high PC selectivity of 99% and a urea conversion rate of 96%, was attained at 160 \u25e6C using CaO\u2013MgO catalysts prepared using a Mg/Ca ratio of 1 and Na2CO3 as a precipitating agent. The best-performing catalysts also exhibited good reusability without any significant loss in PC selectivity. It is expected that the present study will provide useful information on the suitability of different precipitating agents with respect to the catalytic properties of the oxides of Ca and Mg and their application in the synthesis of",

They have been widely employed as solvents in paints, cosmetics, polymer coatings, food packaging, and adhesives [1\u20133]. They are also employed as solvents for organic transformations due to their high stability under ambient conditions [4]. Organic carbonates can be categorized as linear organic carbonates (such as dimethyl carbonate and diethyl carbonate) or cyclic organic carbonates (such as ethylene carbonate, propylene carbonate, and glycerol carbonate) [5\u20137]. Among these, propylene carbonate (PC) can also be used as a starting material for preparing other organic carbonates, such as dimethyl carbonate, diethyl carbonate, and glycerol carbonate [8\u201311]. Additionally, it has found application as an electrolyte for Li-ion batteries due to its high dielectric constant [12\u201314]. Therefore, its increased consumption has led to demand for its\nMaterials 2023, 16, 735. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma16020735 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2023, 16, 735 2 of 13\npreparation in large amounts. Continuous efforts have been made to develop potential catalysts to synthesize propylene carbonates in high amounts. The oldest method used for the synthesis of PC is phosgenation [15]. This involves the reaction of propylene glycol and phosgene, with the production of HCl as a byproduct. The use of toxic raw materials (i.e., phosgene) is the major drawback of this method. Another approach for PC synthesis is the oxidative carbonylation of alcohols with carbon monoxide. Despite showing good product selectivity, this route also suffers from the drawback of using a toxic and poisonous gas as a raw material. The carbonate transesterification route leads to the formation of azeotropes, making the separation of products difficult [4]. PC synthesis by carbonylation of alcohols is an environmentally friendly method, as it involves the utilization of unwanted CO2 gas [16\u201318]. However, the thermodynamic and kinetic limitations of this route lead to low conversion and low yield of PC. PC synthesis from urea alcoholysis with PG is a popular and beneficial method that uses raw materials that are cheap and easily available and proceeds under mild reaction conditions. No azeotrope formation takes place, enabling the easy separation of the product from the reaction mixture. NH3 that is produced as a byproduct can be recycled, leading to improved product yield [19]. A number of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts have been used to catalyze the reaction of urea alcoholysis for PC synthesis [20\u201323]. Homogeneous catalysts are completely miscible in the reactant mixture, providing a better degree of interaction between the reactant molecules and the catalyst [24]. On the other hand, heterogeneous catalysts can be easily separated from the product, regenerated, and reused, making the overall process more economical. Despite this advantage, heterogeneous catalysts face difficulties in reusability due to the deformation of their structure [3]. The requirement of a high reaction temperature is another common barrier. Some synthesis routes are hazardous to health, involve the use of poisonous raw materials, and cause pollution at the same time, which constitutes a significant limitation. These shortcomings have spurred the need to explore new catalysts. A number of studies have been devoted to the usage of transition and alkaline earth metal oxides for the selective production of PC via the process of urea alcoholysis. For example, a high PC yield of 94.8% in 30 min was recorded using Zn\u2013Mg mixed oxides due to the synergistic effect between Mg and Zn and improved surface basicity [25]. In another study, a ternary oxide of Zn\u2013Ca\u2013Al exhibited high PC selectivity (98.4%) and yield (90.8%) because of the increased basicity resulting from the deposition of CaO And Ca(OH)2 species on the catalyst\u2019s surface [26]. Several other studies also demonstrated improved PC production over catalysts composed of Mg and Ca, due to the alteration in the number of basic sites [27,28]. Overall, it can be inferred that Ca and Mg furnish basic active sites to the catalysts and can promote urea alcoholysis to produce PC. Moreover, these elements are low-cost and highly abundant in nature. Therefore, it is worth testing the performance of calcium oxide\u2013magnesium oxide catalysts for PC production using urea and PG as starting materials. To the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, no work has been reported on the utilization of CaO\u2013MgO for PC synthesis through the urea alcoholysis route. In the present study, CaO\u2013MgO catalysts were prepared with different Mg/Ca molar ratios. The effects of different precipitating agents (e.g., NaOH, Na2CO3) and a mixture of NaOH/Na2CO3 on the physical and chemical properties of the catalyst were also investigated. Furthermore, the PC synthesis experiments were performed under varied reaction parameters (i.e., reaction temperature, reaction time, PG/urea molar ratio, and catalyst dosage) to investigate their effects on PC yield and selectivity. Reusability studies on the spent catalysts were performed to verify the industrial viability of CaO\u2013MgO catalysts."

The reaction temperature was set to 160 \u25e6C, and a vacuum pump was used to remove the ammonia gas produced during the reaction. The reaction was carried out for 3 h.

The volume of the segregated liquid product was measured and used for further analysis. Note that all experiments were performed in triplicate, and the results are presented with error bars. The error being recorded for PC production under variable experimental parameters was found be less than 5%, which is below the acceptable amount.

An approximately 17% loss in weight was observed below 400 \u25e6C, attributed to the transformation of precipitated Mg compounds into MgO and the evaporation of solvent water and the water of crystallization [30]. Extensive weight reduction was observed in the temperature range of 400\u2013700 \u25e6C. This was observed because of the decomposition of carbonates. Oxidation and combustion of carboxyl and nitrate groups might be another possible reaction responsible for the emission of CO2, N2, and water vapor. The final reduction of the precursor occurred around 700 \u25e6C. Hence, 700 \u25e6C was chosen as the calcination temperature for the production of CaO\u2013MgO [31].\nMaterials\u00a02023,\u00a016,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 5\u00a0 of\u00a0 14\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nTotal moles of products formedConversion of urea (%) 100 Initial mole of urea taken   \u00a0 (3)\n100 takenurea of moles Initial\nformed PC of Moles(%) PC of Yield  \u00a0 (4)\n3.\u00a0Results\u00a0and\u00a0Discussion\u00a0 3.1.\u00a0Catalyst\u00a0Characterization\u00a0\nThe\u00a0thermal\u00a0analysis\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0uncalcined\u00a0Ca\u2013Mg\u00a0precursors\u00a0prepared\u00a0with\u00a0three\u00a0dif\u2010 ferent\u00a0precipitants\u00a0is\u00a0shown\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a01.\u00a0A\u00a0significant\u00a0reduction\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0weight\u00a0of\u00a0all\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0 catalysts\u00a0was\u00a0observed\u00a0at\u00a0two\u00a0temperatures.\u00a0An\u00a0approximately\u00a017 \u00a0loss\u00a0in\u00a0weight\u00a0was\u00a0 observed\u00a0below\u00a0400\u00a0\u00b0C,\u00a0attributed\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0transformation\u00a0of\u00a0precipitat \u00a0 g\u00a0compounds\u00a0 into\u00a0MgO\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0evaporation\u00a0of\u00a0solvent\u00a0water\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0water\u00a0of\u00a0crystallization\u00a0[30].\u00a0Ex\u2010 tensive\u00a0weight\u00a0reduction\u00a0was\u00a0observed\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0temperature\u00a0range\u00a0of\u00a0400\u2013700\u00a0\u00b0C.\u00a0This\u00a0was\u00a0 observed\u00a0 because\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 decomposition\u00a0 of\u00a0 carbonates.\u00a0Oxidation\u00a0 and\u00a0 combustion\u00a0 of\u00a0 carboxyl\u00a0and\u00a0nitrate\u00a0groups\u00a0might\u00a0be\u00a0another\u00a0possible\u00a0reaction\u00a0responsible\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0emis\u2010 sion\u00a0of\u00a0CO2,\u00a0N2,\u00a0and\u00a0water\u00a0vapor.\u00a0The\u00a0final\u00a0reduction\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0precursor\u00a0occurred\u00a0around\u00a0 700\u00a0\u00b0C.\u00a0Hence,\u00a0700\u00a0\u00b0C\u00a0was\u00a0chosen\u00a0as\u00a0 the\u00a0calcination\u00a0temperature\u00a0 for\u00a0 the\u00a0production\u00a0of\u00a0 C O\u2013MgO\u00a0[31].\u00a0\n\u00a0 Figure\u00a01.\u00a0TG\u00a0curves\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0uncalcined\u00a0catalysts.\u00a0\nPowdered\u00a0XRD\u00a0diffraction\u00a0peaks\u00a0 for\u00a0CaO\u2013MgO\u00a0 synthesized\u00a0with\u00a0varying\u00a0Mg/Ca\u00a0 ratios\u00a0and\u00a0types\u00a0of\u00a0precipitants\u00a0are\u00a0shown\u00a0below\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a02.\u00a0The\u00a0XRD\u00a0peaks\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0cat\u2010 alysts\u00a0showed\u00a0the\u00a0characteristic\u00a0peaks\u00a0of\u00a0distinct\u00a0phases\u00a0of\u00a0CaO\u00a0and\u00a0MgO,\u00a0without\u00a0the\u00a0 presence\u00a0of\u00a0any\u00a0mixed\u2010oxide\u00a0phase\u00a0of\u00a0Ca\u00a0and\u00a0Mg\u00a0oxide\u00a0particles.\u00a0The\u00a0large\u00a0difference\u00a0in\u00a0 the\u00a0ionic\u00a0radii\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0Ca2+\u00a0and\u00a0Mg2+\u00a0ions\u00a0was\u00a0the\u00a0reason\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0formation\u00a0of\u00a0a\u00a0composite\u00a0 oxide\u00a0 instead\u00a0of\u00a0a\u00a0mixed\u00a0oxide\u00a0 [32].\u00a0This\u00a0presence\u00a0of\u00a0cubic\u00a0CaO\u00a0 (2\u03b8\u00a0=\u00a032.2\u00b0,\u00a037.3\u00b0,\u00a0and\u00a0 53.8\u00b0)\u00a0 (JCPDS\u00a0File\u00a0No.\u00a037\u20101497)\u00a0and\u00a0hexagonal\u00a0MgO\u00a0(2\u03b8\u00a0=\u00a042.9\u00b0\u00a0and\u00a062.3\u00b0)\u00a0 (JCPDS\u00a0File\u00a0 No.\u00a04\u20100829)\u00a0was\u00a0 indicated\u00a0by\u00a0 the\u00a0diffraction\u00a0peaks.\u00a0The\u00a0diffraction\u00a0patterns\u00a0were\u00a0com\u2010 pliant\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0standards\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0JCPDS.\u00a0Upon\u00a0increasing\u00a0the\u00a0Mg/Ca\u00a0molar\u00a0ratio,\u00a0the\u00a0dif\u2010 fraction\u00a0peaks\u00a0of\u00a0MgO\u00a0became\u00a0more\u00a0intense,\u00a0while\u00a0those\u00a0of\u00a0CaO\u00a0decreased,\u00a0verifying\u00a0the\u00a0 presence\u00a0of\u00a0pure\u2010oxide\u00a0crystalline\u00a0phases\u00a0of\u00a0Ca\u00a0and\u00a0Mg.\u00a0The\u00a0catalyst\u00a0contained\u00a0the\u00a0min\u2010\nFig . TG curves of the uncalcined catalysts.\ndered XRD diffraction peaks for Ca \u2013MgO synthesized with varying Mg/Ca ratios and types of precipitants are shown below in Figure 2. The XRD peaks of the catalysts showed the characteristic peaks of distinct phases of CaO and MgO, without the presence of any mixed-oxide phase of Ca and Mg oxide particles. The large difference in the ionic radii of the Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions was the reason for the formation of a composite oxide instead of a mixed oxide [32]. This presence of cubic CaO (2\u03b8 = 32.2\u25e6, 37.3\u25e6, and 53.8\u25e6) (JCPDS File No. 37-1497) and hexagonal MgO (2\u03b8 = 42.9\u25e6 and 62.3\u25e6) (JCPDS File No. 4-0829) was indicated by the diffraction peaks. The diffraction patterns were compliant with the standards of the JCPDS. Upon increasing the Mg/Ca molar ratio, the diffraction peaks of MgO became more intense, while those of CaO decreased, verifying the presence of pure-oxide crystalline phases of Ca and Mg. The catalyst contained the mineral calcite (CaCO3) at 2\u03b8 of 29.48\u25e6 and 50.5\u25e6 [20]. This shows that the CaCO3 did not completely decompose to CaO upon calcination. This is because CaCO3 has a stable structure with a very hard shell layer that is difficult to decompose at a temperature of 700 \u25e6C [33]. On the other hand, some peaks of Ca(OH)2 also appeared at 2\u03b8 of 17.8\u25e6, 28.6\u25e6, and 46.8\u25e6 [34]. The formation of Ca(OH)2 was due to the reaction between CaO and H2O in air. The XRD diffractogram for the catalyst prepared using Na2CO3 showed the sharpest and most intense peaks of CaO and MgO, revealing that the sample was in a highly crystalline state. The absence of peaks at 50.5\u25e6 corresponding to calcium carbonate as calcite [35] and the peaks at 28.6\u25e6 and 46.8\u25e6 corresponding to calcium hydroxide were confirmed by the FTIR and TGA analyses for the catalyst prepared using NaOH. A comparison of the catalysts\u2019 surfaces before and after calcination is presented in Figure 3. This helped in studying the alterations induced in the structure of CaO\u2013MgO as a result of calcination. It was observed that the layers present before calcination were broken to produce separate CaO and MgO. The calcination at 700 \u25e6C transformed the aggregate flakes into smaller spheres, possibly due to the extensive loss of hydroxide and carbonate groups and the shrinkage of the unit cell.\nMaterials 2023, 16, 735 6 of 13\nMaterials\u00a02023,\u00a016,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 6\u00a0 of\u00a0 14\u00a0 \u00a0\neral\u00a0calcite\u00a0

the CaO\u2013MgO catalysts with non-uniform structures. Particles of two evidently different types were observed in the images. The tiny particles were of MgO, while the large aggregate particles were of CaO. The catalyst sample with compact agglomerations was consistent with the previously noted morphology of dense particles with a heterogeneous distribution of particle sizes for MgO/CaO [26]. The BET results of the catalysts are displayed in Table 1. It was concluded that the surface area of the catalysts increased when increasing the Mg/Ca ratio from 0.5 to 1. However, upon further increasing the ratio to 2, a decline in the surface area was observed. The surface area of the catalysts prepared with Mg/Ca ratios of 0.5 and 2 was high compared to the catalysts prepared with a Mg/Ca ratio of 1. A possible reason for this decrease in the area could be the aggregation of crystals. Thus, the Mg/Ca ratio of 1 was found to provide the maximum surface area [25]. Figure 4a illustrates the FTIR transmittance spectrum of the CaO\u2013MgO catalyst. Broad peaks at ~3438 cm\u22121 and 3690 cm\u22121 correspond to OH stretching vibrations assigned to the water of crystallization and the interlayer water. The peak at 1460 cm\u22121 corresponds to the asymmetric stretching vibration modes of the carbonate group CO32\u2212 [36]. The bands at ~801 and 862 cm\u22121 correspond to the CO32\u2013 bending vibration modes of CaCO3 [37]. After calcination of the catalysts, the characteristic absorption band of C=O was observed between 2000 and 1500 cm\u22121, indicating the presence of calcium carbonate over the calcined catalyst MgCa0.5CNc. The broad band at ~1463 cm\u22121 and the sharp band at 3634 cm\u22121 are associated with the OH stretching vibration mode of water physisorbed on the surface of CaO. This is related to the OH in Ca(OH)2, as shown in the XRD pattern. However, these peaks corresponding to water and carbonate were found to be less intensified due to the slight removal of the components in the catalyst prepared with Na2CO3 as a precipitant. Furthermore, bands of CaO appeared at around 580 cm\u22121. Meanwhile, these peaks almost disappeared in the case of the calcined catalyst prepared with NaOH as a precipitant. This can also be confirmed from the XRD results of MgCa0.5CNa, showing weak peaks for Ca(OH)2, CaCO3, and CaO. The peaks at 705 cm\u22121 were due to the MgO band. The basicity of the various catalysts, as estimated by the Hammett indicator method, is displayed in Figure 4b and summarized in Table 1. As can be seen, various catalysts revealed varying levels of basicity due to differences in the amounts of their constituent components (i.e., CaO, MgO, CaCO3, and Ca(OH)2) and the nature of the precipitating agents. Among the various catalysts, the strongest basic character (24.07 mmol/g) was demonstrated by MgCa1CN, owing to the existence of various components in desirable amounts."

            "text": "3.2.1. Effects of Different Precipitating Agents\nNa2CO3, NaOH, and NaOH + Na2CO3 were separately used as precipitating agents for the preparation of the catalysts. The best conversion and yield for PC were obtained by the catalysts prepared from Na2CO3. The highest PC yield obtained was 96%, as can be seen in Figure 4c. This result can also be confirmed from the XRD diffractogram, which shows the sharpest peak for the catalyst prepared by Na2CO3. This might be because Na2CO3 was the most effective precipitating agent for causing the precipitation of the salts. This can be explained by the number of active basic sites that were available to catalyze the reaction. The results of the Hammett indicator method confirmed that the catalysts prepared using Na2CO3 had the highest basicity and, thus, the maximum number of active basic sites.\n3.2.2. Effect of Mg/Ca Ratio\nThe EDX data presented in Table 1 show that the Mg/Ca ratios obtained were in accordance with the actual values of Mg/Ca ratios taken in the feed while synthesizing the catalyst prepared using Na2CO3 and NaOH + Na2CO3 as precipitants. Meanwhile, the results obtained for the catalysts prepared using NaOH as a precipitant show that the Mg/Ca molar ratio of the catalysts was higher than that of the feed, which was caused by\nMaterials 2023, 16, 735 8 of 13\nthe greater affinity of Mg2+ ions for precipitation than that of Ca2+ ions [25]. This behavior could be supported by the XRD, FTIR, and TGA results showing the presence of MgO as the dominant compound, with CaO present only in trace amounts. The PC yield increased upon increasing the ratio from 0.5 to 1, and a further increase in the magnesium content led to a decrease in the PC yield. The increased catalytic activity might have been due to the increase in the specific surface area [25]. However, a decrease in catalytic activity at a Mg/Ca ratio of 2 was observed due to changes in the porosity and electronic properties of the catalyst, which eventually led to a decrease in its basicity [4].\nMaterials\u00a02023,\u00a016,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 8\u00a0 of\u00a0 14\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nMgCa0.5CNa,\u00a0showing\u00a0weak\u00a0peaks\u00a0for\u00a0Ca(OH)2,\u00a0CaCO3,\u00a0and\u00a0CaO.\u00a0The\u00a0peaks\u00a0at\u00a0705\u00a0cm\u22121\u00a0 were\u00a0due\u00a0 to\u00a0 the\u00a0MgO\u00a0band.\u00a0The\u00a0basicity\u00a0of\u00a0 the\u00a0various\u00a0 catalysts,\u00a0as\u00a0 estimated\u00a0by\u00a0 the\u00a0 Hammett\u00a0indicator\u00a0method,\u00a0is\u00a0displayed\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a04b\u00a0and\u00a0summarized\u00a0in\u00a0Table\u00a01.\u00a0As\u00a0can\u00a0 be\u00a0 seen,\u00a0various\u00a0 catalysts\u00a0 revealed\u00a0varying\u00a0 levels\u00a0of\u00a0basicity\u00a0due\u00a0 to\u00a0differences\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 amounts\u00a0of\u00a0their\u00a0constituent\u00a0components\u00a0(i.e.,\u00a0CaO,\u00a0MgO,\u00a0CaCO3,\u00a0and\u00a0Ca(OH)2)\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0 nature\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 precipitating\u00a0 agents.\u00a0 Among\u00a0 the\u00a0 various\u00a0 catalysts,\u00a0 the\u00a0 strongest\u00a0 basic\u00a0 character\u00a0 (24.07\u00a0mmol/g)\u00a0was\u00a0 demonstrated\u00a0 by\u00a0MgCa1CN,\u00a0 owing\u00a0 to\u00a0 the\u00a0 existence\u00a0 of\u00a0 various\u00a0components\u00a0in\u00a0desirable\u00a0amounts.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 (a)\u00a0 (b)\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 (c)\u00a0 (d)\u00a0\nFigure\u00a04.\u00a0(a)\u00a0FTIR\u00a0analysis\u00a0of\u00a0calcined\u00a0and\u00a0uncalcined\u00a0CaO\u2010MgO.\u00a0(b)\u00a0Basicity\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0catalysts.\u00a0(c)\u00a0 Effects\u00a0of\u00a0Mg/Ca\u00a0ratio\u00a0and\u00a0precipitating\u00a0agents\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0yield\u00a0of\u00a0PC;\u00a0conditions:\u00a0catalyst\u00a01\u00a0wt.%,\u00a0re\u2010 action\u00a0time\u00a03\u00a0h,\u00a0PG/urea\u00a0ratio\u00a04:1,\u00a0reaction\u00a0temperature\u00a0160\u00a0\u00b0C.\u00a0(d)\u00a0Effect\u00a0of\u00a0basicity\u00a0on\u00a0PC\u00a0yield.\u00a0\n3.2.\u00a0Effects\u00a0of\u00a0Preparation\u00a0Conditions\u00a0of\u00a0CaO\u2013MgO\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0Catalytic\u00a0Performance\u00a0 3.2.1.\u00a0Effects\u00a0of\u00a0Different\u00a0Precipitating\u00a0Agents\u00a0\nNa2CO3,\u00a0NaOH,\u00a0and\u00a0NaOH\u00a0+\u00a0Na2CO3\u00a0were\u00a0separately\u00a0used\u00a0as\u00a0precipitating\u00a0agents\u00a0 for\u00a0the\u00a0preparation\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0catalysts.\u00a0The\u00a0best\u00a0conversion\u00a0and\u00a0yield\u00a0for\u00a0PC\u00a0were\u00a0obtained\u00a0 by\u00a0the\u00a0catalysts\u00a0prepared\u00a0from\u00a0Na2CO3.\u00a0The\u00a0highest\u00a0PC\u00a0yield\u00a0obtained\u00a0was\u00a096%,\u00a0as\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0 seen\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a04c.\u00a0This\u00a0result\u00a0can\u00a0also\u00a0be\u00a0confirmed\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0XRD\u00a0diffractogram,\u00a0which\u00a0 shows\u00a0 the\u00a0 sharpest\u00a0peak\u00a0 for\u00a0 the\u00a0 catalyst\u00a0prepared\u00a0by\u00a0Na2CO3.\u00a0This\u00a0might\u00a0be\u00a0because\u00a0 Na2CO3\u00a0was\u00a0 the\u00a0most\u00a0 effective\u00a0precipitating\u00a0agent\u00a0 for\u00a0 causing\u00a0 the\u00a0precipitation\u00a0of\u00a0 the\u00a0 salts.\u00a0This\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0explained\u00a0by\u00a0the\u00a0number\u00a0of\u00a0active\u00a0basic\u00a0sites\u00a0that\u00a0were\u00a0available\u00a0to\u00a0cat\u2010 alyze\u00a0the\u00a0reaction.\u00a0The\u00a0results\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0Hammett\u00a0indicator\u00a0method\u00a0confirmed\u00a0that\u00a0the\u00a0cat\u2010\nFigure 4.

However, PG will vaporize faster at high temperatures, especially in a vacuum (PG will evaporate at a temperature lower than its boiling point (i.e., 188 \u25e6C) in a vacuum).

(b) PG/urea ratio: catalyst 1 wt.%, reaction time 3 h, reaction temperature 160 \u25e6C. (c) Cat lyst dosage: reaction time 3 h, PG/urea ratio 3:1, reaction temperature 160 \u25e6C. (d) Reaction time: catalyst 2 wt.%, PG/urea ratio 3:1, reaction temperature 160 \u25e6C.\nThe molar ratio of PG to urea varied from 1 to 5, and its effect on the PC yield is displayed in Figure 5b. The PC yield continuously increas with an increase in the molar ratio up to 4. How ver, upon further in rease, the PC yield dropped o 86% at the ratio of 5:1. This can be explained by the fact that a very hi h PG/urea ratio will lead to an extremely low urea concentration, which will trigger side reactio s nd result in the formatio of undesired products [40]. As a result, the reaction rate will decrease, resulting in a low PC yield. Therefore, the maximum PC yield of 95% was obtained at a 4:1 ratio for this reaction. The effect of the catalyst dose on the yield of PC was studied by altering it from 0.5 wt.% to 3 wt.% (Figure 5c). The PC yield increased from 88% to 95% with an increase in the catalyst dosage from 0.5 wt.% to 2 wt.%. Upon further increasing the dose to 3%, PC yield decreased to 93% due to the rapid breakdown of urea into NH3 in the presence of the catalyst [26].\nMaterials 2023, 16, 735 10 of 13\nThe reaction time for PC synthesis by urea alcoholysis over CaO\u2013MgO was studied at regular intervals of time, keeping the rest of the parameters the same. Figure 5d displays the variation in the PC conversion and yield with reaction time. PC conversion was found to increase with time with an increasing PC yield. Increasing the reaction time beyond 4 h did not alter the PC conversion. Beyond 4 h, a decrease in the PC yield was observed due to polymerization of PC [10]. Thus, 4 h was selected as the optimal reaction time [39]."

The catalyst was again reused by the same procedure two more times and then regenerated by calcining it at 700 \u25e6C for 5 h after drying according to the previously described procedure [40,41]. This regenerated catalyst was used for PC synthesis, and the recovered catalyst after completion of the reaction was reused again two more times, the results of which are shown in Figure 6. The PC yield was observed to decrease from 90% to 36% after the reuse experiment; nevertheless, the PC selectivity was found to be as high as 99%. No further experiments on catalyst reusability were performed, due to the marked increase in the catalysts\u2019 density as a result of the species absorbed (e.g., polymerized PC) from the reaction medium.

Some losses can also be inc rre e to t e ysical mishandling of the catalyst. However, there was only a negligible change in the selectivity of the PC during the stability test. It can thus be concluded that changes in the structure of the spent catalyst did not change the reaction mechanism but controlled the extent to which the reaction was carried out. The XRD results of the spent catalyst in Figure 2d show a decrease in the intensity of peaks corresponding to MgO and CaO. The decrease in the CaO peak was tremendous. A high-intensity peak for calcite at 2\u03b8 of 29.48\u25e6 was observed. A possible reason for the presence of CaCO3 is that the CaO in the catalyst reacted with H2O to form Ca(OH)2, which further reacted with CO2 to form calcite [42].\nMaterials 2023, 16, 735 11 of 13"

A summary of the critical parameters to provide comparative analysis of such catalysts is presented in Table 2. As can be seen, most of the reported catalysts (except Zn\u2013Al oxide) require higher reaction temperatures for PC production as compared to our material. However, most of the listed catalysts containing Ma or Ca revealed significantly higher PC yields, including the CaO\u2013 MgO catalysts used in this study. It is also evident from the table that the best PG/urea ratio to achieve the maximum PC yield using varied catalysts is 4, which was also true in our case. Overall, it can be seen that the PC yield and selectivity observed in the present case were better than in the previously reported studies. Furthermore, high consistency was observed in the reactant ratio and catalyst mass required to achieve the maximum PC yield."

The XRD results showed that the prepared catalysts exhibited highly crystalline structures consisting of cubic CaO and hexagonal MgO. The morphological characteristics of the diverse CaO\u2013MgO catalysts as analyzed by FE-SEM revealed the existence of tiny particles of MgO and large aggregates of CaO. BET analysis showed that the catalysts prepared using equal molar ratios of Mg and Ca possessed the highest surface area of 31 m2/g. Batch reactor experiments conducted for PC production demonstrated an increase in the product yield as the PG/urea ratio was increased from 1 to 4. Similarly, a maximum PC yield of ~96% was achieved with a catalyst dose of 2 wt.% with respect to the reactor weight. It was also observed that the optimal time for achieving the maximum PC yield was 4 h, beyond which a reduction in PC yield was observed due to polymerization. Reusability studies on the best catalyst were also performed, which showed a reduction in the PC yield without any significant effect on PC selectivity. Overall, it can be inferred that the mixed oxides of Ca and Mg represent a promising candidate for the production of PC with high selectivity owing to their basicity, as investigated by the Hammett indicator method.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, K.D., N.K., V.C.S., J.P. and M.N.; Validation, V.C.S.; Investigation, N.K.; Data curation, K.D., N.K., J.P. and V.C.S.; Writing\u2014original draft, K.D. and N.K.; Writing\u2014review & editing, N.K., V.C.S., J.P. and M.N.; Supervision, V.C.S. and N.K.
