1. **Investigate the electrochemical properties of the new chalcogenide molybdenum clusters.** The paper demonstrates that the clusters exhibit reversible redox properties, which could be exploited for applications in energy storage or catalysis. Future research could focus on understanding the mechanisms of these redox reactions and exploring the potential of the clusters as electrocatalysts.
2. **Explore the magnetic properties of the new chalcogenide molybdenum clusters.** The paper reports that the clusters are paramagnetic, but the magnetic properties are not fully characterized. Future research could investigate the magnetic properties of the clusters in more detail, including their magnetic susceptibility, magnetization, and magnetic resonance spectra. This information could provide insights into the electronic structure and bonding of the clusters.
3. **Study the reactivity of the new chalcogenide molybdenum clusters.** The paper briefly mentions that the clusters are reactive towards oxygen, but the reactivity of the clusters towards other molecules is not explored. Future research could investigate the reactivity of the clusters towards a variety of molecules, including organic molecules, inorganic molecules, and metal ions. This information could provide insights into the potential applications of the clusters in catalysis and other areas.
4. **Develop synthetic methods for the new chalcogenide molybdenum clusters.** The paper describes a method for synthesizing the clusters from Mo6Br12, but it is not clear if this method is generalizable to other chalcogenide molybdenum clusters. Future research could develop synthetic methods for a variety of chalcogenide molybdenum clusters, including clusters with different nuclearity, ligand environments, and oxidation states.
5. **Explore the potential applications of the new chalcogenide molybdenum clusters.** The paper suggests that the clusters could have potential applications in catalysis, energy storage, and other areas, but these applications are not explored in detail. Future research could investigate the potential applications of the clusters in these areas, including their activity and selectivity in catalytic reactions, their capacity and cyclability in energy storage devices, and their potential for use in other applications.
