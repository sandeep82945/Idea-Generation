 Here are 5 potential future research ideas after reading this paper on modeling deformable viral capsomers:

1. Investigate the effects of different charge distributions on the capsomers. The paper briefly explores adding charges to the top layer, but varying the charge placement and density could impact assembly. 

2. Examine the role of capsomer shape asymmetry. The paper uses symmetric trapezoidal capsomers but exploring how asymmetry affects assembly could provide insights.

3. Incorporate explicit solvent molecules and ions to model hydration and electrostatic effects. The implicit solvent model could be replaced with explicit water and ions for a more detailed picture.

4. Study co-assembly with other biomolecules like DNA/RNA. Adding simple model compounds to represent viral genome could elucidate mechanisms of capsid-genome packaging.

5. Extend the model to study assembly kinetics and pathways. The current model focuses on end states, but modeling kinetics could reveal intermediate steps and transition states in more detail.
