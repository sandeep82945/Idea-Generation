    "abstractText": "Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted at a tertiary hospital in Wuhan, China. Perceived stress, fatigue, and sleepiness were measured using the perceived stress scale (PSS), Fatigue assessment scale (FAS), and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), respectively. AASI was obtained from 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Path analysis was used to clarify the relations among the PSS, FAS, and ESS scores, and their relations to AASI values.",

Perceived stress, fatigue, and sleepiness were measured using\nthe perceived stress scale (PSS), Fatigue assessment scale (FAS), and Epworth\nSleepiness Scale (ESS), respectively. AASI was obtained from 24-h ambulatory\nblood pressure monitoring. Path analysis was used to clarify the relations\namong the PSS, FAS, and ESS scores, and their relations to AASI values.\nResults: A total of 153 participants were included herein. The PSS and FAS correlated with the ESS (r = 0.424, p < 0.001), and the PSS correlated with the\nFAS (r = 0.614, p < 0.001). In addition, the ESS correlated with the AASI (r = 0.225,\np = 0.005). According to the path analysis results, the PSS and FAS had no direct effect on the AASI, but did have an indirect effect on this index (\u03b2 = 0.059, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.017\u20130.128, p = 0.005; \u03b2 = 0.059, 95%CI = 0.016\u20130.135, p = 0.006, respectively) by influencing the ESS (\u03b2 = 0.263, \u03b2 = 0.262, p = 0.004).\nConclusion: Sleepiness was a mediator of the effects of perceived stress and fatigue on AASI.\nKEYWORDS\nperceived stress, fatigue, sleepiness, ambulatory arterial stiffness index, medical staff, path analysis\nTYPE Original Research PUBLISHED 27 October 2022 DOI 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1010647"

            "text": "As the main providers of medical services, medical staff have primary responsibility for patient recovery. The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), which initially broke out in December 2019, has negatively impacted many countries, dramatically changed people\u2019s lives, and increased work challenges for medical staff (Haleem et\u00a0al., 2020). Social and work environment risk factors can have profound adverse effects on mental health among hospital staff (Greenberg et\u00a0al., 2020; Kapetanos et\u00a0al., 2021; Saeed et\u00a0al., 2021). One epidemiological survey showed that medical workers in China displayed significant psychological disturbance including anxiety symptoms, depression symptoms, stress-related symptoms, and sleep problems, with aggregate prevalence rates of 27.0, 26.2, 42.1, and 34.5%, respectively, during the COVID-19 outbreak (Zhang et\u00a0 al., 2021). Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic can now also be\u00a0considered a chronic stressor for medical staff, with multiple negative effects that include an unsustainable workload, excessive financial hardship, and fear of uncertainty regarding continued impact (Gupta et\u00a0al., 2021). Therefore, psychological disorders among medical staff may be\u00a0persistent, and attention should be\u00a0paid to their mental health.\nPerceived stress, defined as \u201cthe degree to which situations in one\u2019s life are appraised as stressful,\u201d refers to feelings of unpredictability, uncontrollability, and overload (Lehrer et\u00a0al., 2020). One study found a prevalence of high perceived stress as high as 56% among medical staff in the COVID-19 context (Yan et\u00a0al., 2021). Physiologically, high stress levels activate the autonomic nervous system and hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013 adrenal axis, reduce immunity, and increase inflammatory cytokines, which can lead to physiological changes, including cardiovascular system and sleep behavior alterations (Kemeny, 2003). Furthermore, higher perceived stress is associated with sleepiness and can lead to risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes (Cummings et\u00a0al., 2016; Valente et\u00a0al., 2019).\nSleepiness, a consequence of disordered, poor, and insufficient sleep, is defined in the MeSH database as a compelling urge to sleep. The main causes of sleepiness are social environment (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic), psychological distress, poor mental health, insufficient sleep, and disease (e.g., obstructive sleep apnea) (Becerra et\u00a0al., 2022; Thorarinsdottir et\u00a0al., 2022). A link between daytime sleepiness and cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension and stroke\u2014which are related to arterial stiffness\u2014 is well established (Yang et\u00a0al., 2022).\nThe ambulatory arterial stiffness index (AASI), defined as 1 minus the regression slope of blood pressure (BP) values obtained by 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM), is a relatively new indicator of arterial stiffness (Li et\u00a0 al., 2006). In addition to reflecting degree of atherosclerosis, AASI can predict subclinical left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction and is an independent predictor of major adverse cardiovascular events (Ahmed et\u00a0al.,\n2020; Boos et\u00a0al., 2021). It is thus considered an important and promising risk prediction tool.\nFatigue, defined as \u201ca subjectively unpleasant symptom that incorporates total body feelings ranging from tiredness to exhaustion, creating an unrelenting overall condition which interferes with individuals\u2019 ability to function at normal capacity\u201d (Ream and Richardson, 1996), is common among medical staff due to their work environment and pressures. Chronic fatigue and adverse cardiovascular events are associated (Naess et\u00a0 al., 2005) and fatigue is linked to sleepiness (Kim et\u00a0 al., 2019), which indicates poor health (Becerra et\u00a0al., 2022). Thus, fatigue may also lead to a decline in work quality among medical staff. Moreover, the positive association between higher perceived stress and greater fatigue symptoms is also well-established (Wang et\u00a0 al., 2021). Cumulatively, fatigue may moderate the relation between perceived stress and sleepiness; it may also moderate the indirect effects of perceived stress on AASI, through sleepiness.\nAlthough numerous studies have examined perceived stress, fatigue, and drowsiness among health professionals, to our knowledge none have linked these factors to AASI. Therefore, our aim was to clarify the associations among perceived stress, fatigue, and drowsiness, and their relations to AASI. We\u00a0proposed the following hypotheses: (1) perceived stress, fatigue, and sleepiness are intercorrelated; (2) perceived stress and fatigue affect sleepiness; (3) sleepiness affects AASI; (4) perceived stress and fatigue directly and/or indirectly affect AASI; and (5) sleepiness mediates the effects of perceived stress and fatigue on AASI."

Though intercorrelations were strong, VIF values were < 5 and tolerance values were > 0.2, indicating no multicollinearity between variables."

            "text": "Herein, we\u00a0 found that perceived stress, fatigue, and sleepiness are common among medical staff. About 58.17% of our sample had at least moderate stress, and 36.64% had excessive daytime sleepiness, similar to previous reports (Busch et\u00a0 al., 2021; Kowalczuk et\u00a0 al., 2021). Furthermore, 92.16% reported at least moderate fatigue, which may be\u00a0due to the fact that 75.16% of our study was female. Certain sex-specific physiologic factors (e.g., menstruation, contraception) and social background combined with living conditions (e.g., balancing employment and childcare) can cause women to report fatigue more often compared with men (Bensing et\u00a0al., 1999). Hence it is important to focus on mental health among medical staff, especially in the COVID-19 context.\nPerceived stress, fatigue, and sleepiness were significantly intercorrelated, and perceived stress and fatigue were both positively related to sleepiness, supporting our first two hypotheses. These findings are also theoretically sound. According to Hans Selye, stress is the non-specific response to environmental stimuli, including general adaptation syndrome and local adaptation syndrome (Selye, 1976). General adaptation disorders include several common symptoms and signs, including fatigue, sleep problems, and gastrointestinal syndrome (Selye, 1998). The effect of fatigue on sleepiness might be\u00a0 via inhibition of the central nervous system. An accumulation of brain adenosine causes tiredness, which, with further sleep deprivation, can manifest as mental exhaustion. This feedback loop can lead to the central nervous system activating protective mechanisms to avoid further damage from excessive fatigue, activating movement and nerve inhibition and a decline in physical vitality, or a tired response (Martin et\u00a0al., 2018). Fatigue has an inhibitory effect on neurons, leading to"

This leads to the long-term experience of negative emotions; the significant burden of stress on cognitive emotion regulation may thus increase stress-related emotional sensitivity and intensity (Weymar et\u00a0al., 2012).\nMoreover, the mean ESS score among our participants was 8.84 points; that it was >6 indicates common daytime sleepiness among these medical staff. Daytime sleepiness is associated with development of cardiometabolic disease (Qureshi et\u00a0 al., 1997; Newman et\u00a0al., 2000; Jia et\u00a0al., 2022), consistent with our result and supporting our third hypothesis. In terms of mechanism of action, sleep disorders diminish nitric oxide bioavailability to impair nitric oxide-mediated endothelial-dependent vasodilation, leading to a hardening of the arteries and increased risk of cardiovascular disease (Bain et\u00a0al., 2017).\nHowever, we\u00a0did not find direct effects of either perceived stress or fatigue on AASI. Previous studies have also found inconsistent relations between perceived stress and cardiovascular reactivity (Klatzkin et\u00a0al., 2019). For example, Steptoe and Kivim\u00e4ki reviewed the literature to find an inconclusive relation between stress and stroke; in particular, self-reported stress was not a strong predictor of stroke (Steptoe and Kivim\u00e4ki, 2013). Yet it is worth noting that there is a gender difference in the association between fatigue and cardiovascular disease, with a stronger causal relation in males than in females (Honkonen et\u00a0al., 2006), which might explain why fatigue did not directly affect AASI in our study.\nThough the average PSS score herein was 31.16, representing moderate stress, we\u00a0believe the lack of association with AASI may be\u00a0due to the fact that our participants are relatively young and thus have some regulatory flexibility to reduce the cumulative\nburden of stress, so that it did not translate directly to cardiovascular risk. Another possibility is that, consistent with Dienstbier\u2019s model of physiological resilience, exposure to moderate life stress may cause individuals to adapt or \u2018toughen\u2019 and show an adaptive physiological response to acute challenges, and then recover relatively quickly (Dienstbier, 1989). Although the average FAS score herein was 30.42, indicating moderate fatigue among these medical staff, most participants were women. The effects of fatigue on the cardiovascular system is due to a chronic, long-term process (i.e., unexplained fatigue lasting at least 6 months) (Natelson et\u00a0al., 2021), possibly explaining why fatigue in our sample did not have a significant direct effect on AAS. Thus, the current perceived stress and fatigue among this sample may not pose a health threat.\nNevertheless, the effect of a stress\u2013fatigue interaction on health should not be\u00a0ignored. According to our SEM analysis, fatigue played a moderating role between perceived stress and sleepiness, and also influenced AASI indirectly via sleepiness symptoms. If we\u00a0 consider AASI as a predictor of LV systolic dysfunction, medical staff who are both stressed and fatigued may be\u00a0at higher risk for developing cardiovascular disease. Therefore, hospital administrators and managers should consider monitoring stress and fatigue symptoms among their medical staff, and then implementing effective interventions.\nThere were some study limitations. First, ours was a singlecenter study at a tertiary hospital, which may limit its generalizability. It will therefore be\u00a0 necessary to carry out multicenter studies, including multi-level hospitals, to draw more accurate conclusions. Second, this was a cross-sectional study, so that causation will need to be\u00a0established with future prospective studies. Finally, though based on an a priori power analysis, our\nTABLE\u00a03 Correlations and multi-collinearity values for PSS, FAS, ESS, and AASI.\nVariables PSS p-Value FAS p-Value ESS p-Value VIF Tolerance\nPSS 1 1.695 0.590\nFAS 0.614 < 0.001 1 1.695 0.590\nESS 0.424 < 0.001 0.424 < 0.001 1 1.287 0.777\nAASI 0.129 0.111 0.024 0.765 0.225 < 0.001 \u2013 \u2013\nFIGURE\u00a01 Model diagram of ESS as a mediator variable.\nTABLE\u00a04 Effects estimate of hypothesized model (standardized coefficients).\nStructural path\nDirect effect\np-Value Indirect effect\n(95%CI)\np-Value\nPSS \u2192 ESS 0.263 0.004 \u2013 \u2013\nFAS \u2192 ESS 0.262 0.004 \u2013 \u2013\nESS \u2192 AASI 0.225 0.004 \u2013 \u2013\nPSS \u2192 AASI \u2013 \u2013 0.059 (0.017\u2013\n0.128)\n0.005\nFAS \u2192 AASI \u2013 \u2013 0.059 (0.016\u2013\n0.135)\n0.006\nFrontiers in Psychology 06 frontiersin.org\nsample size was still relatively small and future studies should include larger samples."
