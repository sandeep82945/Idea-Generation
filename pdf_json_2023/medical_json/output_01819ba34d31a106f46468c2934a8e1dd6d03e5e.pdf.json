    "abstractText": "The incorporation of polymeric components into aerogels based on clay produces a significant improvement in the physical and thermal properties of the aerogels. In this study, clay-based aerogels were produced from a ball clay by incorporation of angico gum and sodium alginate using a simple, ecologically acceptable mixing method and freeze-drying. The compression test showed a low density of spongy material. In addition, both the compressive strength and the Young\u2019s modulus of elasticity of the aerogels showed a progression associated to the decrease in pH. The microstructural characteristics of the aerogels were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The chemical structure was studied by infrared spectroscopy with Fourier transform (FTIR). The TGA curves from a non-oxidizing atmosphere indicated that the clay had a mass loss of 9% above 500 \u25e6C and that due to the presence of polysaccharides, the aerogels presented a decomposition of 20% at temperatures above 260 \u25e6C. The DSC curves of the aerogels demonstrated a displacement in higher temperatures. In conclusion, the results showed that aerogels of ball clay with the incorporation of polysaccharides, which are still minimally studied, have potential application as thermal insulation considering the mechanical and thermal results obtained.",

            "text": "The first silica-based aerogels were developed in 1931 and 1932 by Kistler using the supercritical drying method. They were not well explored as there was no practical application for them and the drying method made their production unfeasible. The supercritical drying method consists of removing the liquid from the hydrogels through a supercritical fluid to obtain a stable material filled with air, which is of a size similar to the original hydrogel [1]. Recent studies show that the most viable drying process is lyophilization, which is considered a simple, ecologically acceptable, and efficient approach since water is used as a solvent, which significantly reduces the cost of production [2,3]. Recently, the postive mechanical and thermal properties of clay-based aerogels have attracted the attention of many researchers. Thus, numerous applications have been developed from aerogels, such as thermal insulation [4\u20136], drug administrators [2], catalysis [7], acoustic insulation [8], removal of heavy metal ions [9], and flame retardants [10\u201312]. In addition, the incorporation of polymer components into clay-based aerogels can improve the mechanical properties, especially toughness and mechanical strength [13]. Clay aerogel composites are a class of materials with a three-dimensional structure, permanent porosity, low density, low thermal conductivity, and fire retardant behavior [14]. Therefore,\nPolymers 2023, 15, 2412. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym15112412 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2023, 15, 2412 2 of 15\nhybrid aerogels based on clay are considered a potential material, as clay is low cost, available, nontoxic, biodegradable, and easily produced [4]. Ball clay, also called plastic clay, is defined as a type of sedimentary clay with fine grain size, high plasticity, and lower refractoriness that contains kaolinite and has strong binding properties [15,16]. These clays have been widely used in agriculture, the ceramic industry, and as suspension agents or binders in several industries but have rarely been used in the production of aerogel. The term \u201cball clay\u201d has no mineralogical meaning but originated in an ancient method of exploration in England, which consists of cutting the clay into cubes and then rounding them into balls to facilitate transport [17]. This type of clay is found in Brazil only in two regions: in S\u00e3o Sim\u00e3o in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo and in the northeast region, especially in Oeiras in the state of Piau\u00ed [18]. Angico gum (AG) is a macromolecular polysaccharide consisting of arabinose (67%), galactose (24%), rhamnose (2%), and glucuronic acid (7%) that is isolated from Anadenanthera colubrina var. cebil, known as \u201cred angico\u201d, which is found in several regions of Brazil, especially in the Cerrado biome. AG is an abundant biopolymer in nature and has a great potential in the production of materials in several areas because it is a great source of complex polysaccharides and has a wide ability to form films and gels [19,20]. Sodium alginate (SA) is a natural polysaccharide extracted from seaweed [20]. It is usually used in biomedical material to support cells and control drug delivery. SA is also a known flame-retardant material due to its low oxygen index value [21,22]. Due to the low viscosity of AG, which can make the aerogel fragile [19], combining it with SA can be an advantageous alternative to obtain better viscosity and hydrophilicity so it can be used without difficulty in modified materials such as hydrogels and sponges [23]. In addition, when combined, a new composite with properties different from those achieved with the individual use of polysaccharides can be developed. Another considerable advantage is that polysaccharides are renewable and biodegradable [24]. In the recent literature, there are no reports on the production of aerogels using angico gum, ball clay, or a combination of angico gum and ball clay. This study aims to develop an aerogel using angico gum, alginate, and ball clay, with water as the solvent and drying by the lyophilization method. In addition, in this work, studies of the mechanical and thermal properties of the aerogels produced were carried out."

Mechanical Performance\nThe compression test was performed on cylindrical samples approximately 14 mm diameter and 14 mm in height using Emic DL20000 equipment, (S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Pinhais, Brazil), with a 5000 N load cell. The specific modulus was determined by the ratio between the compression modulus and the apparent density.\n2.3.2. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)\nThe micrographs were created with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) with a field emission cannon, FEI brand, (Eindhoven, The Netherlands). Quanta FEG 250 model, with acceleration voltage of 1 to 30 kV. For the micrographs, the samples were fixed on aluminum substrate (stub) using double-sided carbon adhesive tape.\n2.3.3. Apparent Density\nTo calculate the densities of dry aerogels, an analytical balance (Mettler Toledo AB204S), (Barueri, Brazil), was used to measure the mass. A digital caliper was used to measure\nPolymers 2023, 15, 2412 4 of 15\nthe dimensions. The density for each composition was calculated from the ratio of mass by volume for each sample.\n2.3.4. X-ray Diffraction Microstructure\nThe patterns of the X-ray diffraction of ball clay, angico gum, alginate, and aerogels were investigated at room temperature at the Federal University of Piau\u00ed (UFPI) using Shimadzu equipment, (Kyoto, Japan), model XRD-6000, in normal mode with Cu-K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb = 1.5418), operating with a voltage of 40 kV and a current of 30 mA, and using a step of 0.02\u25e6 (2\u03b8) in the sweep range of 2\u03b8 from 5 to 75\u25e6.\nDegree of Relative Crystallinity\nThe degree of crystallinity was determined by the method used in the study performed by Zhang et al. [26]. Origin 2018 software was used in this analysis, and a smooth curve was plotted in the XRD diffractogram separating the area of the peaks, which corresponds to the crystalline portion. The area below, between the smooth curve and the rectilinear line that sweeps the 2\u03b8 range from 5 to 35\u25e6, corresponds to the amorphous part.\nEquation (1) was used to calculate the degree of relative crystallinity in all samples:\nX(%) = Ap At \u00d7 100 (1)\nwhere X corresponds to the degree of relative crystallinity, Ap is the area of the peaks, and At indicates the area of the peaks plus the area below the gentle line (the amorphous area). The range of the diffractogram sweep was from 2\u03b8 = 5\u25e6 to 35\u25e6 in all samples.\n2.3.5. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy\u2013FTIR\nThe chemical structure of the aerogels was verified using a Perkin Elmer infrared equipment, (S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil), model Spectrum 100 with samples for KBr powder with resolution of 4 cm\u22121 in the spectral wave number range of 4000 to 400 cm\u22121 with XX accumulations.\n2.3.6. Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)\nThe thermogravimetric analysis was performed with a TGA-51H Shimadzu, (Kyoto, Japan), thermogravimetric analyzer. Masses of around 10 mg were used under a nitrogen flow of 50 mL/min. The heating rate was 10 \u25e6C/min between 25 \u25e6C and 800 \u25e6C. The TGA curve and DTG derivative were plotted using Origin software.\n2.3.7. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)\nDSC was obtained with the Shimadzu, (Kyoto, Japan), model DSC-60 plus Differential Scanning Calorimeter, operating in the temperature range of 25 to 600 \u25e6C at a heating rate of 10 \u25e6C/min and in a nitrogen atmosphere with a flow rate of 50 mL/min."

Table 2 shows the apparent density, compressive strength, specific modulus (calculated by a division between compression modulus and density), and Young\u2019s modulus of elasticity of the aerogels. The density is compatible with previous studies performed with aerogels of mixed matrices of chitosan/polybenzoxazine that presented densities between 0.051 and 0.073 g/cm3 [32] and aerogels of palygorskite/wood fiber (0.033\u20130.072 g/cm3) [29]. There was a slight decrease in density with varying the pH from 8 to 7, indicating that the addition of acid did not shrink the structure of the material [10]. Both the compressive strength and Young\u2019s modulus of elasticity for the aerogels showed an increase associated with a decrease in the pH. The compressive strength of AG4.5SA0.25C-8 increased from 0.53 to 0.96 MPa and the Young\u2019s modulus of elasticity of increased from 0.505 to 0.934 MPa when the pH decreased from 8 to 6, respectively. The specific modulus increased 14.2 times, going from 5.64 to 80 MPa. This result is similar to aerogels of crosslinked alginate with calcium chloride [22]. The pH decrease contributed to an improvement in the chemical interaction between polysaccharides and between polysaccharides and clay, providing the formation of a more compact three-dimensional network [33]. At low pH values, there is a change in the characteristics of polysaccharides, making them more physiologically positive and facilitating interaction with clay, which has an anionic character as shown in Table S1 in the Supplementary Data. This change in the properties of polysaccharides can occur due to the protonation of functional physiological groups, such as carboxylate groups, causing them to become positive. The interaction between the opposite charges of clay and polysaccharides can occur through electrostatic bonds or other intermolecular forces. Previous studies show that alginate is crosslinked at low pH values, which can result in a thicker alginate and clay solution [10]. The pH adjustment did not cause shrinkage in aerogels, which is considered better than the crosslinking normally used [10].

Comparing the specific modules with the increase in the concentration of polysaccharides indicated that a 33.5% increase in AG led to a twofold higher value than with the 100% increase in the alginate concentration.

As was already reported for the gums, the AG diffractogram showed the characteristics of an amorphous material with a wide diffraction peak at 2\u03b8 = 19.5\u25e6 and the SA was characteristic of a semi-crystalline material [36,37]. The SA diffractogram has an intense diffraction peak at 2\u03b8 = 13.36\u25e6 that is related to a long-range chain order and occurs due to hydrogen bonds and polar intraand intermolecular interactions [38].

The bands at 2918, 1406, and 1018 cm\u22121 were assigned to -CH2 asymmetric stretch, -CH2 scissoring vibration, and C-O-C asymmetry stretch in the pyranose ring, respectively. The appearance of a wide and extensive band centered at 3437 cm\u22121 in the spectrum of the aerogels can be attributed to vibrations of O-H elongation due to the inter- and intramolecular interaction of the H binding of polymeric compounds [42]. In the FTIR spectrum of clay, the absorption bands in the region between 3700 and 3600 cm\u22121 correspond to the elongation of surface hydroxyl. The absorption band at 3697 cm\u22121 is associated with the external grouping of O-H located in the octahedral surface sheet of kaolinite; the absorption band at 3620 cm\u22121 is assigned to the inner O-H group of the tetrahedral plane of the laminar structure of kaolinite [43], which\nPolymers 2023, 15, 2412 10 of 15\ncan interact strongly with polysaccharides by hydrogen bonding [44]. The mineralogical absorption bands at 1114 cm\u22121 and 1030 cm\u22121 refer to the Si-O stretch, whereas the band at 912 cm\u22121 refers to Al-OH flexion [24]. In aerogels, the main clay absorption bands are displaced longer wavelengths at the peak at 3697 cm\u22121 of the clay, with possible interactions between the polysaccharides and the functional groups of kaolinite. The FTIR results show that the asymmetric and symmetric COO- and OH- groups shifted to 1627 and 1419 cm\u22121 and proved a strong interaction between alginate and clay. A slight shift in the peak of alginate from around 1419 cm\u22121 to 1423 cm\u22121 can also be seen in the aerogel. In the aerogel FTIR spectrum with the same composition and pH value (8, 7 and 6) shown in Figure S3, it can be observed that the main peaks of ball clay (3697\u20133621 cm\u22121) do not show significant displacement. A slight change in the intensity of these peaks is observed at pH 8. The broad band between 3200 and 3500 cm\u22121 shifted to longer wavelengths with a decrease in the pH. In addition, the evolution of a new peak at around 1114 cm\u22121 at pH 7 was observed, which may be related to the Si-O stretching of kaolinite [45]. In all aerogels, the peak at 536 may be associated with the Al-O fold of the clay that may be displaced, suggesting a hydrogen bond between the polysaccharides and the clay [25]. The intense bands in the spectra of AG and SA are characteristic of the natural polysaccharides at 2918 cm\u22121, 1406 cm\u22121, and 1026 cm\u22121 that correspond to the vibrations of the asymmetric stretch of -CH2, vibration scissors of -CH2, and asymmetric stretch of C-O-C, respectively [46,47]. In general, the occurrence of displacements in the characteristic bands and changes in the intensity of the peaks present in the FTIR spectrum indicate the existence of flexible molecules between the biopolymers and the clay.

Thermal Stability The thermogravimetric curves in a non-oxidative atmosphere are represented in Figure 7, and the results are summarized in Table 4. The thermal behavior of the clay is similar to that reported in previous studies [15,18]. Figure 7a presents the TGA curve of clay, which presents two events. The first initially at 45 \u00b0C correspond to water loss. The second peak with has the highest mass loss in the region from 500 to 600 \u00b0C and is associated with the dehydroxylation of clay minerals and formation of metakaolinite [18]. The clay presented a mass loss of approximately 9% in the total heating process. Previous studies show that a mass loss close to 13% for ball clay confers better plasticity and refractoriness for the clay, a relevant factor for technological application [48]. The TGA curves of both AG and SA have three regions of mass loss. The first mass loss at temperatures below 100 \u00b0C was due to the loss of water and ethanol that were not eliminated in the drying process. The second and third mass loss regions correspond to the decomposition of the polysaccharides that occurs in two stages [49]. The TGA curves of the aerogels also show three regions with mass loss. The first is between 25 and 100 \u00b0C, which may be associated with absorbed moisture, indicating an adsorption of water molecules by the aerogel, a result similar to that described in previous studies [32]. The second and third mass losses in the aerogels are due to the degradation of the polysaccharides. The AG DTG peaks at 320 and 480 \u00b0C are also seen in aerogels, but with displacement of the peak at 480 to 490 \u00b0C in aerogels with higher concentrations of AG (Figure 3b). This temperature range displacement, when compared with the initial materials, indicates that there is interaction between the components. The loss peaks above 500 \u00b0C seen in samples C and SA were not observed in the aerogel degradation curves. In addition, a decrease in decomposition temperature in the aerogels with increased concentrations of polysaccharides can be verified. The increase in AG also showed a lower decomposition temperature than for SA.\nFigure 6. FTIR spectra of clay, AG, SA, and aerogels at pH 6."

The first is between 25 and 100 \u25e6C, which may be associated with absorbed moisture, indicating an adsorption of water molecules by the aerogel, a result similar to that described in previous studies [32]. The second and third mass losses in the aerogels are due to the degradation of the polysaccharides. The AG DTG peaks at 320 and 480 \u25e6C are also seen in aerogels, but with displacement of the peak at 480 to 490 \u25e6C in aerogels with higher concentrations of AG (Figure 3b). This temperature range displacement, when compared with the initial materials, indicates that there is interaction between the components. The loss peaks above 500 \u25e6C seen in samples C and SA were not observed in the aerogel degradation curves. In addition, a decrease in decomposition temperature in the aerogels with increased concentrations of polysaccharides can be verified. The increase in AG also showed a lower decomposition temperature than for SA. Polymers 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 12 of 16\nFigure 7.

The AG DSC curve shows only two events, one endothermic, possibly representing water evaporation, and one exothermic at 306 \u25e6C, which is very characteristic of aerogels but with a displacement to 317 \u25e6C in aerogels with higher concentrations of AG. The SA curve is very different from the others as it has water evaporation and presents a composition of exothermic peaks with an endothermic peak in the temperature range 200 to 300 \u25e6C, as well as a characteristic exothermic peak in the range 540 to 600 \u25e6C. Aerogels with higher concentrations of AG did not show apparent loss of water. In addition, the crystalline state of the aerogels can be identified from the existence of endothermic peaks in the region of the melting point in the clay and SA curves that are not observed in the aerogels [47].

Conclusions Aerogels based on ball clay and polysaccharides were produced through a physical process of mixing and drying by lyophilization, without the necessity of a chemical crosslinking agent. The mechanical tests prove the spongy structure of the aerogels, with an elastic deformation, a low density (0.012\u20130.097 g/cm3), and compressive strength of 1.4 MPa. A reduction in pH from 8 to 6 improved the mechanical properties without affecting the density of the aerogels, raising the specific modulus from 5.64 MPa to 80 MPa. XRD diffractograms showed that ball clay is comprised of kaolinite with basal spacing d001 = 0.71 nm, which makes it promising for aerogel production with the incorporation of polymeric components such as angico gum and alginate. The detection of displacements in the peaks of DTG suggest the existence of interaction between the polysaccharides and the clay, indicating that the ball clay has high thermal stability. The results of EDS and analysis of the chemical characteristics of ball clay by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry confirm the presence of alumina and silica, which results in a considerable resistance to temperature. These results open new possibilities for studies directed towards the application of this composite for thermal insulation.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: www.mdpi.com/xxx/s1, Table S1: The result from \u03b6 potential gives natural clay treated at temperatures of 200, 400, and 600 \u00b0C; Table S2: Bulk density, theoretical density, and porosity defined as the volumetric fraction of voids; Figure S1: Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis of natural ball clay and ball clay treated at 200 \u00b0C; Figure S2: Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of natural ball clay samples and those treated at 200 \u00b0C; Table S3: Analysis of chemical characteristics by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF) of ball clay; Figure S3: FTIR spectra of samples of the same composition at different pH values (6, 7, and 8).
