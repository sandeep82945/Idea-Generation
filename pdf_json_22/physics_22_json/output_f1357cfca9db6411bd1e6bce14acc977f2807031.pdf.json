To produce hydrogen from water, photocatalytic water splitting is the most favorable method. For a few decades, researchers have been devoted to producing some novel metal-based inexpensive environment friendly photocatalytic materials.3 Twodimensional materials like hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have invoked considerable interest aer the successful development of graphene in 2004.4 Single layer transition metal dichalcogenides have tremendous applications like optoelectronics, spintronics, valleytronics, photovoltaic devices, gas sensing, and catalysis\nng, Computational Centre for Molecular\nChemistry, Nankai University, Tianjin\nin 300071, P.

Transition metal phosphides have been discovered recently to decompose methyl orange efficiently and to produce hydrogen by photocatalytic activity.25 These ndings have opened new windows for searching of novel photocatalysts and screening of newmaterials.26,27 Recent reports showMoP2 is used to produce hydrogen as semi-metallic photocatalyst. MoP2 nanosheets possess excellent electronic properties with high active site density exposure.28 Many early transition metal dipnictides (TMDPs) have been explored in orthorhombic and OsGe2 or MoP2 type-phase.28\u201336 However, TMDPs with hexagonal graphene-like structure remains unexplored.\nIn this paper, we theoretically studied structural, electronic, optical, and photocatalytic properties of novel 2D transition metal dipnictides XP2 (X \u00bc Ti, Zr, Hf). Our results show that XP2 (X \u00bc Ti, Zr, Hf) with stable graphene-like hexagonal geometry are semiconductors with moderate band gaps which show good optical activity in visible and near ultraviolet region. Furthermore, the band edge positions straddle the water redox potential, predicting XP2 monolayers as suitable candidates for photocatalytic water splitting."

The optimized lattice parameters, bond lengths (dX\u2013P), bond angle (qP\u2013X\u2013P) and calculated band gap using PBE and HSE06 schemes are listed in Table 1. The phonon band spectrum of XP2 (X \u00bc Ti, Zr, Hf), displayed in Fig. 1(b\u2013d), consists of three lowest frequency acoustic modes with no imaginary frequency at the G-point. This conrms that all studied monolayers are dynamically stable. Further, the thermal stability of all XP2 monolayers has been ascertained by\n11204 | RSC Adv., 2022, 12, 11202\u201311206\nperforming ab initiomolecular dynamics (AIMD) calculations at room temperature. The snap shots of the nal geometry of XP2 monolayers with energy uctuation versus time (5000 ps) have been shown in Fig. 1(e\u2013g). All single layer XP2 have no considerable energy uctuations and possess no broken bonds in the nal structures at 300 K, indicating the experimental fabrication of understudy systems.\nAer conrmation of structural stability and manufacturing possibility of monolayers XP2, electronic band structure and density of states (DOS) are calculated (as displayed in Fig. 2(a\u2013\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

According to our calculations, XP2(X \u00bc Ti, Zr, Hf) monolayers reveal semiconducting behavior with indirect band gap of 0.70 eV, 0.67 eV and 1.23 eV respectively with PBE functional. In addition, the hybrid functional (HSE06)44 is used to make correction to the self-interaction (SIF) error which underestimates band gap. The calculated band structure of XP2 monolayers exhibits the same band character with larger band gap values 1.72 eV (TiP2), 1.43 eV (ZrP2) and 2.02 eV (HfP2). Red and blue colors represent HSE06 and PBE band structure as shown in Fig. 2(a\u2013c). For TiP2 and ZrP2systems, the conduction band minimum (CBM) lies at the M-point and valence band maximum (VBM) lies at the G-point of the Brillouin zone, representing an indirect band nature. In case of HfP2, CBM lies between M and G point while VBM lies at G-point of the Brillouin zone indicating an indirect semiconducting behavior. Similar trend is observed for other two dimensional materials.25,28,49,50,52,54\nThe analysis of individual states contributing near the Fermi level (EF) is obtained by plotting the partial density of states (PDOS) of understudy systems. The X-d (orange), P-s (pink), P-p (cyan) orbitals and Fermi level (EF) represented by blue dashed line are shown in Fig. 2(d\u2013f). The PDOS of X-s and X-p states found deeper in energy region are avoided here. It is obvious from Fig. 2(d\u2013f) that both VBM and CBM are predominantly attributed by P-s orbital of all XP2 systems.\nThe optical behavior of XP2 systems is crucial for exploring the absorption and conversion of sunlight into electric current for various applications. Complex dielectric function specically describes optical properties by formula 3(u) \u00bc 31(u) + i32(u).49 In the present work, the optical absorption spectra in terms of imaginary part 32(u) is calculated between 0\u20137.0 eV energy range, as shown in Fig. 3. From 32(u) spectra of all XP2 systems, a considerable visible light absorption is found between 1.65\u20133.3 eV energy range, suggesting these monolayers as promising candidates for solar energy absorber and photovoltaic applications.\nGenerally, the band gap of a material must be larger than 1.23 eV to perform the photocatalytic activity for water splitting. Using HSE06 functional, the calculated band gap values of XP2 monolayers exceed free energy value (1.23 eV), implying that XP2 monolayers satises the water splitting reaction. The valence band edge (EVB) and conduction band edge (ECB) positions are obtained by using HSE06 functional, schematically represented in Fig. 4. The standard redox potentials for photocatalytic water splitting mechanism are calculated by:\nEO2/H2O \u00bc 5.67 eV + pH 0.059 eV and EH+/H2 \u00bc 4.44 eV + pH 0.059 eV.49\u201353 Therefore, we considered redox potential levels for water as shown in Fig. 4. For HfP2 monolayer, the band edge potentials (both EVB and ECB) straddle the standard redox potentials at pH \u00bc 0. However, the valence band edge of TiP2 and ZrP2 monolayers found above the standard oxidation potential thus, fails to perform oxidation evolution reaction at pH \u00bc 0. More interestingly, all XP2 monolayers with both EVB and ECB located below and above the standard redox potentials at pH \u00bc 7, indicates the ability to dissociate water into H+/H2 and O2/H2O under the irradiation of sun light. Similar behavior\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).
