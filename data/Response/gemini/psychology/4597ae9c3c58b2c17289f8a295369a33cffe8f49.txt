1. **Investigate the relationship between polyploidy and gene expression in Psidium species.** This could be done by comparing the expression levels of genes in diploid and polyploid individuals of the same species. This information could help to understand how polyploidy affects the regulation of gene expression and how this, in turn, affects the phenotype of the plant.


2. **Study the role of epigenetic modifications in the regulation of secondary metabolism in Psidium species.** This could be done by investigating the DNA methylation patterns and histone modifications in plants with different essential oil yields and compositions. This information could help to understand how epigenetic modifications contribute to the regulation of secondary metabolism and how this could be manipulated to improve the production of essential oils.


3. **Explore the potential of Psidium species as sources of novel natural products.** This could be done by screening extracts of Psidium species for biological activity against a variety of targets, such as cancer cells, bacteria, and fungi. This information could lead to the discovery of new drugs or other useful compounds.


4. **Develop new breeding strategies for Psidium species.** This could be done by using molecular markers to select for plants with desirable traits, such as high essential oil yield or resistance to pests and diseases. This information could help to improve the productivity and sustainability of Psidium cultivation.


5. **Investigate the ecological role of Psidium species in their native habitats.** This could be done by studying the interactions between Psidium species and other plants and animals in their ecosystems. This information could help to understand the role of Psidium species in maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem function.
