    "abstractText": "Many marine organisms produce bioactive molecules with unique characteristics to survive in their ecological niches. These enzymes can be applied in biotechnological processes and in the medical sector to replace aggressive chemicals that are harmful to the environment. Especially in the human health sector, there is a need for new approaches to fight against pathogens like Stenotrophomonas maltophilia which forms thick biofilms on artificial joints or catheters and causes serious diseases. Our approach was to use enrichment cultures of five marine resources that underwent sequence-based screenings in combination with deep omics analyses in order to identify enzymes with antibiofilm characteristics. Especially the supernatant of the enrichment culture of a stony coral caused a 40% reduction of S. maltophilia biofilm formation. In the presence of the supernatant, our transcriptome dataset showed a clear stress response (upregulation of transcripts for metal resistance, antitoxins, transporter, and iron acquisition) to the treatment. Further investigation of the enrichment culture metagenome and proteome indicated a series of potential antimicrobial enzymes. We found an impressive group of metalloproteases in the proteome of the supernatant that is responsible for the detected anti-biofilm effect against S. maltophilia.",

Even more evolutionary events in prokaryotic species can be detected in oceans, and these species exhibit an even higher genetic variety (Whitman et\u00a0al. 1998). There are several studies about pharmaceutically relevant metabolites from marine organisms. Two studies, for example, highlighted that the phylum Actinobacteria contains many candidates which produce secondary metabolites with antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral characteristics (Prashith Kekuda et\u00a0al. 2010; Manivasagan et\u00a0al. 2013). Especially the synthesis of antibiotics like oxytetracycline by Streptomycetes is of great importance (Petkovi\u0107 et\u00a0al. 2006; Quinn et\u00a0al. 2020). Furthermore, Streptomycetes originating from the soft coral Sarcophyton convolutum represent a source of antimicrobial enzymes (El-Gendy et\u00a0al. 2021). Similar discoveries were made by investigation of sponge-associated bacteria which produce substances like * Ines Krohn ines.krohn@uni-hamburg.de 1 Department of\u00a0Microbiology and\u00a0Biotechnology, Institute of\u00a0Plant Science and\u00a0Microbiology, University of\u00a0Hamburg, Ohnhorststr.18, 22609\u00a0Hamburg, Germany 2 Technology Platform Next Generation Sequencing, Leibniz Institute of\u00a0Virology, Martinistra\u00dfe 52, 20251\u00a0Hamburg, Germany 3 Tierpark Hagenbeck, Gemeinn\u00fctzige Gesellschaft mbH, Lokstedter Grenzstra\u00dfe 2, 22527\u00a0Hamburg, Germany\nApplied Microbiology and Biotechnology (2023) 107:7119\u20137134\n1 3\nphospholipases or cellulases (Selvin 2008; Shanmughapriya et\u00a0al. 2009; Santos-Gendelman et\u00a0al. 2014). In addition, investigations of marine-derived fungi revealed a series of compounds, like polyketides and alkaloids, which act cytotoxically on cancer cell lines (Rateb and Ebel 2011; Shabana et\u00a0al. 2021). The same effect can be observed by lipopeptides like halobacillin and mixirin from marine Bacillus strains (Sansinenea and Ortiz 2011; Mondol et\u00a0al. 2013).\nMetagenomics enables a deep view of the genomes of different microorganisms. After taking an environmental sample, the DNA can be isolated either directly from the material or from enrichment cultures in specific media (Alma'abadi et\u00a0al. 2015; Popovic et\u00a0al. 2015). The metagenome DNA can be sequenced and analyzed with different bioinformatics tools and databases. Sequence-based screenings reveal bioactive compounds from habitats of interest (Alma'abadi et\u00a0al. 2015; Popovic et\u00a0al. 2015; Robinson et\u00a0al. 2021). This approach increases the possibility of finding a wider range of extraordinary putative antimicrobial agents in comparison to the cultivation of only one bacterial strain.\nIn addition, there are studies about enzymes like glycosidases, proteases, and DNases which can degrade extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and thereby increase the permeability and vulnerability of biofilms for antibiofilm agents (Algburi et\u00a0al. 2017; Fleming and Rumbaugh 2017; Saggu et\u00a0al. 2019). Proteases are especially promising because of their ability to disintegrate proteins which are the critical components of the extracellular matrix (Lister and Horswill 2014; Saggu et\u00a0al. 2019). Aureolysin (Aur), staphopain A (ScpA), and staphopain B (SspB) are examples of proteases that are active on a mature Staphylococcus aureus biofilm (Fleming and Rumbaugh 2017; Lister and Horswill 2014). Another point of action represents the extracellular DNA which is important for the first phase of biofilm formation (Whitchurch et\u00a0al. 2002; Steinberger and Holden 2005; Basl\u00e9 et\u00a0al. 2017). For example, Bacillus licheniformis produces NucB, an enzyme that inhibits the accumulation of singleand mixed-species biofilms (Rostami et\u00a0al. 2017).\nHowever, microbial biofilms are increasingly coming into focus because of their relevance to the medical sector. Nearly 80% of all bacterial infections in human beings are attributed to biofilm-producing organisms (Romling and Balsalobre 2012; Fleming and Rumbaugh 2017). Artificial joints, catheters, and other devices which are in direct contact with patients are particularly susceptible to biofilm attachment (Darouiche 2004; Jamal et\u00a0 al. 2018; Zhang et\u00a0al. 2021). There are a number of bacterial strains that cause such difficulties. The most common ones are Pseudomonas aeruginosa and S. aureus which are well studied (Driscoll et\u00a0al. 2007; Lister and Horswill 2014; Guendouze et\u00a0al. 2017). Another biofilm former has been getting attention: Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. This bacterium is aerobic, Gram-negative, rod-shaped, and belongs to the\nGammaproteobacteria (Hansen 2012; Alio et\u00a0al. 2020). It is also an opportunistic pathogen and responsible for infections in humans like pneumonia, bacteremia, and endocarditis (Brooke 2012; Abda et\u00a0al. 2015; Sanchez 2015; Adegoke et\u00a0al. 2017; Alio et\u00a0al. 2020). This nosocomial organism forms thick biofilms in the lungs of immunocompromised patients and on medical devices as well.\nDue to these serious problems, we chose this candidate for our study. In particular, we worked with the clinical isolate K279a (Crossman et\u00a0al. 2008; An and Berg 2018). Overall, in this study, we used the approach of enrichment cultures with marine material and sequence-based screenings in combination with metagenomics and proteomics to find potential antimicrobial proteins. We showed that the supernatant of an enrichment culture with a stony coral, Montipora foliosa, inhibited biofilm formation most strongly when we incubated it with the pathogen S. maltophilia K279a. The fractionation of the supernatant and deeper analysis via LC-MS narrowed it down to a group of active proteases. Thereby our data imply that metalloproteases could be the source of biofilm inhibition. We hypothesize that the fascinating group ultimately destructs the structure of a biofilm and can be applied for therapies against infections with S. maltophilia and probably even other strains."

The Alphaproteobacteria were represented by Ruegeria (16.1%), Labrenzia (0.6%), Roseibium (0.5%), Leisingera (0.1%), and 0.6% unclassified Rhodobacteraceae. In addition, 2.8% Microbulbifer (Gammaproteobacteria) and 0.7% Gordonia (Actinobacteria) were found."

About 25% of all key features were represented by amino acids, carbohydrate, and energy metabolism. In addition, membrane transport and metabolism of cofactors and vitamins were highlighted with nearly 13% (Table\u00a01). Signal transduction was represented with 4%, nucleotide metabolism with nearly 4%, and lipid metabolism and translation mechanisms with 3%. The metabolism of other amino acids, replication, repair, and xenobiotics biodegradation was observed at about 2%. The following key features were all represented with 1%: biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, cell motility, drug resistance, folding, sorting, degradation, glycan biosynthesis, and metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides.\nIn the next step, we focused on the overall enzymes potentially involved in anti-biofilm activity (Table\u00a02). Potential anti-biofilm enzymes were involved in hydrolysis of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), quorum quenching mechanisms, and cell wall degradation processes. The COG-based search showed a range of diverse biomolecules, described for potential anti-biofilm mechanisms in literature. In total, we detected 49 chelatases, 175 deacetylases, 224 deaminases, 195 decarboxylases, 181 endonucleases, 472 lyases, 10 lysozymes, and 14 polyketide synthases. However, one group accounted for most of these enzymes, namely, 515 proteases. Beyond that, we found many potential quorum quenching enzymes, such as 148 acylases, 39 lactonases, and 605 oxidoreductases.\n7124\nApplied Microbiology and Biotechnology (2023) 107:7119\u20137134\n1 3\nTranscriptome analysis indicated highly active genes of\u00a0biofilm formation and\u00a0stress response\nTo unravel the potential inhibitory mechanism behind the strong biofilm, we investigated the transcriptome of S. maltophilia K279a. The aim of this analysis was the identification of genes involved in this process and to clarify the effect of M. foliosa supernatant on gene level as well. The nextgeneration sequencing (NGS) of the biofilm mRNA resulted in 8,895,226 sequences with an average length of 149\u00a0bp and a GC content of 62.50% (Supplemental Table\u00a0S3). The circular genome mapping of S. maltophilia K279a was generated using the Circular Genome Viewer tool within PATRIC, the Pathosystems Resource Integration Center (http:// www. patri cbrc. org) (Fig.\u00a03). The up- and downregulated genes were presented in the inner rings in red and green, respectively (Fig.\u00a03), and summarized in Supplemental Table\u00a0S4. Their significance has been plotted in the volcano plot (Fig.\u00a04A).\nData depicted in Fig.\u00a04 and Supplemental Table\u00a0S4 demonstrate clearly that K279a reacted to the supernatant of the M. foliosa enrichment culture. There was evidence of biofilm building but also of stress response in general. The distribution of gene expression between S. maltophilia K279a incubated with the supernatant of M. foliosa enrichment culture and control sample is represented by the volcano plot (Fig.\u00a04A). The volcano plot was constructed to compare the\ntwo groups using ggVolcanoR. A total of 1,530 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified from the dataset (Fig.\u00a04A). Among them, 612 and 918 genes were upregulated and downregulated, respectively, between the two groups according to their log2FC and p values. The strongest and most significantly differentially regulated genes were 32 counts of downregulated and 8 counts of upregulated genes for transcriptional regulators in the LysR family (Fig.\u00a04B). Besides that, there were 13 gene counts for peptidases, 10 for acyl carrier proteins, and 10 for two-component transcriptional response regulators, which were upregulated. Interestingly, several counts for TonB-dependent receptors (13 upregulated and 29 downregulated) could be detected. The largest group of upregulated genes was represented by two-component system sensor histidine kinases (16). The downregulated genes were dominated by 48 counts of membrane proteins. In contrast, there were only a few outer membrane proteins (9), which were upregulated. In addition, the analysis of downregulated genes resulted in response regulators (30), mobile element proteins (28), uncharacterized\n7125\n1 3\nMFS-type transporter (24), and oxidoreductases (23). The group of acetyltransferases was represented by 17 counts of downregulated and 10 counts of upregulated genes. More details about all up- and downregulated genes related to the response of K279a to the M. foliosa culture have been listed in Supplemental Table\u00a0S4. We could identify genes linked to defense mechanisms, carbohydrate, coenzyme, ion and lipid transport and metabolism, methionine biosynthesis, oxidative stress-related mechanisms, repair mechanisms, signal transduction, transporter, efflux pumps, and secretion systems. In detail, two genes coding for the metal resistance proteins Acr3 and CzcD and one gene coding for an antitoxin to RelE-like translational repressor toxin were highly upregulated. In addition, two genes for major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporter systems and one gene for an autotransporter related to pathogenesis were upregulated as well. The deeper analysis of antimicrobial and defense mechanisms revealed downregulated antimicrobial enzymes like FAD-binding monooxygenase, endonucleases, and exonucleases. In addition, genes within inorganic ion transport and metabolism mostly covered iron acquisition, arsenic, and heavy metal resistance, which are known to be connected with biofilm formation (Farasin et\u00a0al. 2017; Hoeft et\u00a0al. 2010; Kang and Kirienko 2018; Teitzel and Parsek\n2003). A series of genes connected to signal transduction and regulation mechanisms were downregulated. These genes included transcriptional regulators, chemotaxis genes, and iron-sulfur cluster proteins that act as a sensor of the environment and enable the organism to adapt to the prevailing conditions (Crack et\u00a0al. 2012; Tout et\u00a0al. 2015).\nSecretome\u2011based analysis provided a\u00a0large group of\u00a0hydrolases\nWe further investigated the supernatant using proteomic tools to verify the metagenome and transcriptome-based results. The investigation of the total supernatant proteome resulted in 338 peptides with masses between 31 and 159\u00a0 kDa (Supplemental Table\u00a0 S5). In general, we found hydrolases, including proteases, alpha-amylases, glutathione hydrolase proenzymes, chitosanases, oligopeptidebinding proteins, pectate lyases, glucuronoxylanases, and phosphoesterases. However, the most abundant enzymes were proteases, in particular, 77 metalloproteases, 46 serine proteases, 32 neutral proteases, 17 cell wall-associated proteases, and 13 extracellular proteases. Nearly all hydrolases detected in the proteome originated from Bacillus strains. This detection corresponded with our phylogenetic analysis\nApplied Microbiology and Biotechnology (2023) 107:7119\u20137134\n1 3\nof the metagenome (Fig.\u00a02). About 9% of all classified bacterial strains in the enrichment culture belonged to the genus Bacillus.\nThe fractionation with the FPLC system refined the search for the responsible enzymes in the supernatant of the M. foliosa enrichment culture. The concentrated sample was collected into 33 units, and the contained proteins were separated according to their size. During this process, the large molecules were eluted from the column first and the small ones last. Afterwards, all fractions were analyzed and 8 fractions that contained putative proteins (Supplemental Fig.\u00a0S2 A) were detected. To verify the activity, biofilm prevention assays with S. maltophilia K279a were performed and shown in Supplemental Fig.\u00a0S2 together with the undiluted supernatant. All samples were compared to the strain with potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) which acted as a negative control. Astonishingly, the whole supernatant could reduce the biofilm density about 40%, just as the commercially acquired protease (subtilisin A) from B. licheniformis (P5380, Sigma-Aldrich, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). The fractions 23 and 24 also significantly decreased the biofilm by about 20%, in contrast to the negative control (Supplemental Fig.\u00a0S2 B).\nThe proteome analysis of these highly interesting active fractions led to significant sequences of a putative microbial protease with a mass of 100\u00a0kDa and a sequence coverage\nof 0.74 (Supplemental Table\u00a0S6). A search with the data resource UniProt (universal protein database, https:// www. unipr ot. org, The UniProt Consortium 2021) and NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information, https:// www. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/, Sayers et\u00a0al. 2021) resulted in the protease ColA, with a sequence identity of 99.89%. This enzyme is a highly active peptidolytic and collagenolytic protease originating from B. cereus (Abfalter et\u00a0al. 2016).\nNovel potential metalloproteases\u2011phylogenetic assignment and\u00a0proposed mechanism\nThe proteome investigation of the two fractions (fractions 23 and 24), as described in the previous section, revealed a potential metalloprotease (Fig.\u00a05) with 38 \u03b1-helices and 17 \u03b2-sheets and a catalytic Zn2+ in the active site (Abfalter et\u00a0al. 2016). The phylogenetic analysis indicated that this protein belongs to the MEROPS (MEROPS database, http:// merops. sanger. ac. uk) family M9 of bacterial extracellular metalloproteases (BEMPs) (Fig.\u00a05, Wu and Chen 2011). The M9 family contains, besides ColA, metalloproteases from Vibrio sp. or Clostridium histolyticum (Fig.\u00a05). In total, 11 different groups or subgroups form this class of metalloproteases.

            "text": "In the last years, biofilm-forming microorganisms, like P. aeruginosa and S. maltophilia, have come more into focus because of their ability to cause serious diseases. S. maltophilia strains have evolved high resistance to common antibiotics, e.g., quinolones and cephalosporins (Looney et\u00a0al. 2009; Sanchez 2015). For this reason, there is a need for new biomolecules and enzymes to attack the biofilm of pathogens and stop their spreading. However, to date, there are only a few studies describing effective antimicrobials against S. maltophilia. In this study, we addressed this current topic and provided a strategy to disrupt biofilm formation.\nOur preliminary biofilm assays led to a highly interesting enrichment culture supplemented with parts of the stony coral M. foliosa. One remarkable and interesting fact is that corals like M. foliosa live in symbiosis with microorganisms which are important for the health and resilience of these marine invertebrates (Shnit-Orland and\nKushmaro 2009; Peixoto et\u00a0al. 2017). There are studies about bacteria living in the mucus that produce substances to compete with other microorganisms (Shnit-Orland and Kushmaro 2009; Pereira et\u00a0al. 2017; Peixoto et\u00a0al. 2017). The overall investigations of the metagenomic dataset of our M. foliosa enrichment culture showed that Firmicutes was the dominant phylum. Interestingly, several candidates belonging to the genus Bacillus showed antimicrobial activity by secretion of various metabolic components. For example, a Bacillus firmus culture extract could reduce the biofilm of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) about 83% (Ghosh et\u00a0al. 2022). With bioinformatical analysis of our datasets, we detected numerous potential antimicrobial agents, especially proteases, endonucleases, chelatases, and quorum quenching active enzymes. With the additional tool of transcriptome analysis, we were able to investigate the pathogen and its reaction to the added supplements in detail. These datasets provided evidence that the supernatant of the M. foliosa enrichment culture strongly influenced S. maltophilia K279a biofilm formation and induced stress response. Outstanding was the set of upregulated genes, like the transcriptional regulator LysR, which act as a virulence factor in pathogenic\nFig. 5 Phylogenetic tree of bacterial extracellular metalloproteases (BEMPS) grouped in MEROPS families. The phylogenetic tree was constructed with MegaX (Kumar et\u00a0 al. 2018) using the maximum likelihood method and JTT matrix-based model (Jones et\u00a0 al. 1992). The bootstrap consensus tree deviates from 1000 replicates (Felsenstein 1985) after multiple alignments with T-Coffee (https:// tcoff ee.\ncrg. eu/, Notredame et\u00a0al. 2000). The percentage of bootstrap resamplings \u2265 70 is illustrated on the branches. The scale bar represents the expected number of changes per amino acid position. This classification of metalloproteases is based on Wu and Chen (2011). *The predicted microbial metalloprotease from the bacterial community of M. foliosa is integrated into the MEROPS family M9\n7128\nApplied Microbiology and Biotechnology (2023) 107:7119\u20137134\n1 3\nmicroorganisms and is crucial for biofilm formation and protease production (Wang et\u00a0al. 2021; Islam et\u00a0al. 2021). Besides, there were gene counts for TonB-dependent receptors, which are responsible for the uptake of ironbinding siderophores (Pawelek et\u00a0al. 2006; Noinaj et\u00a0al. 2010). Iron acquisition is indispensable for the transition of a pathogen from planktonic growth to biofilm building (Kang and Kirienko 2018; Zhang et\u00a0al. 2021; Berlutti et\u00a0al. 2005). A study of the transcriptomes of seven different S. maltophilia isolates also validated the upregulation of genes coding for TonB-dependent receptors (Alio et\u00a0 al. 2020). Furthermore, we identified several gene counts for sensor histidine kinases and peptidases. These two enzyme groups are involved in the adaptation to changing conditions and stress response mechanisms, respectively (Khorchid and Ikura 2006; Culp and Wright 2017). We detected the upregulation of a gene coding for the membrane protein Acr3. This permease acts as a metalloid antiporter and is thus responsible for arsenite resistance (Wawrzycka et\u00a0al. 2017; Aaltonen and Silow 2008). Appropriately, the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporter system could be identified, known for\nthe efflux of arsenicals as well (Garbinski et\u00a0al. 2019). The CzcD protein, which was also highly upregulated, acts in a similar functional way. It exports heavy metals, like cobalt, zinc, and cadmium, from the cytoplasm into the periplasm (Anton et\u00a0al. 1999; Sullivan et\u00a0al. 2021). Additionally, there was proof of a toxin-antitoxin system for preventing toxicity and probably building persister cells (Wang and Wood 2011; Kasari et\u00a0al. 2013).\nHowever, in general, a biofilm protects the bacterial cells against outside influences like chemicals and predators. Additionally, the physical barrier increases the antibiotic resistance up to 1000-fold (Fleming and Rumbaugh 2017; Rogers et\u00a0al. 2010). To get access to the bacterial strains inside the film, the structures of the extracellular matrix must be attacked. Studies like Elchinger et\u00a0 al. (2014) showed proteases can be applied in an early stage of biofilm formation. Extracts of a flavourzyme and a neutrase were effective against Staphylococcus epidermidis and partly against S. aureus biofilm. Especially the degradation of matrix proteins, like protein A, fibrinogen-binding proteins, and clumping factor B, and associated destabilization of the biofilm is a target-oriented strategy (Lister and\nFig. 6 Schematic model of S. maltophilia biofilm including compounds and proposed mechanism of metalloproteases. A Model of S. maltophilia K279a biofilm structure including selected extracellular polymeric substances of lipids (structure: phosphatidylcholin), polysaccharides (structure: levan), proteins/enzymes, and extracellular DNA. B General mechanism of metalloproteases (modified, based on Hofmann 1985; Els\u00e4sser and Goettig 2021). (1) General peptide structure with R1-R3 representing side chain specifying the amino acid, serving as substrate for the metalloprotases. (2) A water molecule is kept in place by a zinc-(II)-cation which bonded on histidine of the metalloprotease. The endometalloprotease (gray enzyme) with\nan oxygen-(I)-anion and hydrogen-ion degrades the peptide bond. (3) When the substrate protein interacts with the enzyme, the zinc(II)-cation binds to the carboxyl group of the substrate amino acid. The hydrogen of the enzyme bonds to the nitrogen of the amino acid, while the hydroxidion of the water molecule binds to the resulting free carbon. The remaining hydrogen binds to the oxygen-(I)-anion of the metalloprotease. (4) Degradation products. ChemDraw 21.0.0.28 (https:// perki nelme rinfo rmati cs. com) was used for drawing, displaying, and characterizing chemical structures, substructures, and reactions. Biofilm and biological components were created with BioRender (https:// www. biore nder. com/)\n7129\nApplied Microbiology and Biotechnology (2023) 107:7119\u20137134\n1 3\nHorswill 2014; Saggu et\u00a0al. 2019). Matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) are known to disintegrate parts of human extracellular matrixes (Pardo et\u00a0al. 2008; Rowan et\u00a0al. 2008). Glycoproteins, like collagen and elastin, are points of action (Cui et\u00a0al. 2017). For example, the bacterium Microbacterium sp. SKS10 secretes a metalloprotease able to remove S. aureus biofilm (Saggu et\u00a0al. 2019). There is evidence for a human matrix metalloprotease, more precisely a collagenase, that prevents and degrades Enterococcus faecalis biofilm effectively (Kumar et\u00a0al. 2019).\nOur secretome evaluation showed potential proteases in the supernatant of the M. foliosa enrichment culture. The fractionation of the supernatant and further LC-MS/MS analysis of two fractions resulted in the identification of a putative metalloprotease. Bacterial extracellular metalloproteases (BEMPs) cover families and subfamilies of serine or metalloproteases which degrade proteins outside of the bacterial cell (Wu and Chen 2011; Zhou et\u00a0al. 2009). Furthermore, these endoproteases also play critical roles in bacterial virulence against eukaryotes (Wu and Chen 2011). Candidates of the family M4 are known to be involved in diseases caused by P. aeruginosa, E. faecalis, and Vibrio cholerae (Adekoya and Sylte 2009). These proteases destruct components of tissues and other cell compartments, like elastin, gelatin, and occludin (Yang et\u00a0al. 2015; Wu et\u00a0al. 2015; Francisco et\u00a0al. 2021). The serratiopeptidase (serralysin) from Serratia marcescens belongs to the MEROPS family M10 and is responsible for lung and corneal damage (Nageswara et\u00a0al. 2019). In addition, the zinc-dependent metalloprotease 1 (Zmp 1) produced by Mycobacterium tuberculosis was investigated for its role in human tuberculosis (TB) (Master et\u00a0al. 2008; Liang et\u00a0al. 2021). In general, the biofilm matrix is composed of extracellular polymeric substances like DNA, polysaccharides, proteins, and enzymes as well as lipids (Fig.\u00a06A; Limoli et\u00a0al. 2015; Majumdar et\u00a0al. 2022; Garc\u00eda et\u00a0al. 2023) Metalloproteases act mainly on the degradation of proteins, depicted in Fig.\u00a06B. For this, (endo)metalloproteases hydrolyze the peptide bond between the amino acids. Mandatory for this is a water molecule linked to one or two zinc-(II)-cations connected to histidine amino groups of the enzyme. When the substrate enters the active site of the metalloprotease, the metal ions combine with the double-bonded oxygen of the carboxyl group of the target substrate protein. In the following reaction, the peptide bond is hydrolyzed, resulting in two separate amino acid chains (Hofmann 1985; Els\u00e4sser and Goettig 2021).\nThe enzyme assigned in this study could be comparable to ColA from B. cereus, a secreted collagenase known for gelatinolytic activity against native tropocollagen (Abfalter et\u00a0al. 2016). It belongs to the MEROPS family M9 which possesses a Zn2+ in the active center and one activator domain, one peptidase domain, one or two polycystic kidney disease-like domains (PKD), and one to three collagen\nbinding domains (CBD). This class of enzymes can degrade the major components in the extracellular matrix or on the cell surface in vertebrates, which makes these proteins potentially useful in pharmaceutical applications (Matsushita and Okabe 2001; Eckhard et\u00a0al. 2013; Abfalter et\u00a0al. 2016).\nInterestingly, there is a series of pathogenic microorganisms, like Vibrio alginolyticus and Streptococcus gordonii, producing collagenases (Abfalter et\u00a0al. 2016; Watanabe 2004). Predominantly, this group of metalloproteases attacks eukaryotic matrix components. In detail, these enzymes cleave important structural proteins of the EPS such as collagen and elastin. Further points of attack are the glycoproteins fibronectin, vitronectin, and entactin (Apte and Parks 2015; Mittal et\u00a0al. 2016; Cui et\u00a0al. 2017). However, some studies revealed that proteases, e.g., from the MEROPS family 23, can disrupt the cell walls of other bacteria and thus are suitable as an antimicrobial agent (Nilsen et\u00a0al. 2003; Ahmed et\u00a0al. 2003). Our microbial metalloprotease showed convincing activity against the biofilm formation of S. maltophilia K279a in an early phase. The confocal images validate impressively a detachment of cells and destruction of the dense film. The analysis of the live and dead cells proved a clear reduction of the biofilm thickness.\nIn summary, with the great potential of samples from the marine environment, we identified a bacterial metalloprotease with convincing biofilm prevention activity against a human pathogen. Possibly, it could be applied to prevent the successful attachment of biofilms of various strains in the medical field and thereby bring us closer to a solution to this serious challenge.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s00253- 023- 12781-0.\nAcknowledgements The authors would like to thank Dr. Jana Heise and her team at NH DyeAgnostics GmbH for the proteome analysis and productive collaboration.\nAuthor contribution MP and IK contributed to experimental design; lab work of metagenomic, proteomic, transcriptomic, and microscopic analytical approaches; and writing of the research article.
