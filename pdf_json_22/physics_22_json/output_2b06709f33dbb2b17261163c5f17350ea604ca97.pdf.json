    "abstractText": "Speed-of-sound and attenuation of ultrasound waves vary in the tissues. There exist methods in the literature that allow for spatially reconstructing the distribution of group speed-of-sound (SoS) and frequency-dependent ultrasound attenuation (UA) using reflections from an acoustic mirror positioned at a known distance from the transducer. These methods utilize a conventional ultrasound transducer operating in pulse-echo mode and a calibration protocol with measurements in water. In this study, we introduce a novel method for reconstructing local SoS and UA maps as a function of acoustic frequency through Fourier-domain analysis and by fitting linear and power-law dependency models in closed form. Frequency-dependent SoS and UA together characterize the tissue comprehensively in spectral domain within the utilized transducer bandwidth. In simulations, our proposed methods are shown to yield low reconstruction error: 0.01 dB/cm\u00b7MHzy for attenuation coefficient and 0.05 for the frequency exponent. For tissue-mimicking phantoms and ex-vivo bovine muscle samples, a high reconstruction contrast was achieved. Attenuation exponents in a gelatin-cellulose mixture and an ex-vivo bovine muscle sample were found to be, respectively, 1.3 and 0.6 on average. Linear dispersion of SoS in a gelatin-cellulose mixture and an ex-vivo bovine muscle sample were found to be, respectively, 1.3 and 4.0 m/s\u00b7MHz on average. These findings were reproducible when the inclusion and substrate materials were exchanged. Bulk loss modulus in the bovine muscle sample was computed to be approximately 4 times the bulk loss modulus in the gelatin-cellulose mixture. Such frequency-dependent characteristics of SoS and UA, and bulk lossmodulus may therefore differentiate tissues as potential diagnostic biomarkers.",

There exist methods in the literature that allow for spatially reconstructing the distribution of group speed-of-sound (SoS) and frequency-dependent ultrasound attenuation (UA) using reflections from an acoustic mirror positioned at a known distance from the transducer. These methods utilize a conventional ultrasound transducer operating in pulse-echo mode and a calibration protocol with measurements in water. In this study, we introduce a novel method for reconstructing local SoS and UA maps as a function of acoustic frequency through Fourier-domain analysis and by fitting linear and power-law dependency models in closed form. Frequency-dependent SoS and UA together characterize the tissue comprehensively in spectral domain within the utilized transducer bandwidth. In simulations, our proposed methods are shown to yield low reconstruction error: 0.01 dB/cm\u00b7MHzy for attenuation coefficient and 0.05 for the frequency exponent. For tissue-mimicking phantoms and ex-vivo bovine muscle samples, a high reconstruction contrast was achieved. Attenuation exponents in a gelatin-cellulose mixture and an ex-vivo bovine muscle sample were found to be, respectively, 1.3 and 0.6 on average. Linear dispersion of SoS in a gelatin-cellulose mixture and an ex-vivo bovine muscle sample were found to be, respectively, 1.3 and 4.0 m/s\u00b7MHz on average. These findings were reproducible when the inclusion and substrate materials were exchanged. Bulk loss modulus in the bovine muscle sample was computed to be approximately 4 times the bulk loss modulus in the gelatin-cellulose mixture. Such frequency-dependent characteristics of SoS and UA, and bulk lossmodulus may therefore differentiate tissues as potential diagnostic biomarkers.\nKeywords: ultrasound tomography, ultrasound attenuation, viscoelasticity, complex bulk modulus, speed of sound\n1 INTRODUCTION\nMedical imaging methods aim to characterize and spatially map different soft tissue properties in order to provide diagnostic information regarding pathological structures and processes. Ultrasound imaging is a cost-effective, real-time and non-ionizing medical imaging modality. Conventional B-mode ultrasound imaging aims to map the amplitude of ultrasound waves scattered and reflected from tissue structures. Complementary to this, several methods exist in the literature to quantify various tissue characteristics. For instance, shear-wave elastography imaging (SWEI) aims to infer local soft tissue shear moduli, often derived from the group speed of propagating shear-waves that are\nEdited by: Xose Luis Dean Ben,\nUniversity of Zurich, Switzerland\nReviewed by: Mailyn P\u00e9rez-Liva,\nComplutense University of Madrid, Spain\nChen Shen, Rowan University, United States\n*Correspondence: Orcun Goksel\nogoksel@ethz.ch\nSpecialty section: This article was submitted to Medical Physics and Imaging,\na section of the journal Frontiers in Physics\nReceived: 23 January 2022 Accepted: 19 April 2022 Published: 11 May 2022\nCitation: Chintada BR, Rau R and Goksel O (2022) Spectral Ultrasound Imaging of Speed-of-Sound and Attenuation\nUsing an Acoustic Mirror.

Since soft tissues are inherently viscoelastic [3], several ultrasound-based imaging techniques were proposed to fully characterize the soft tissues in spectral domain by imaging the shear-wave speed [4\u20136] and shear-wave attenuation as a function of frequency [7\u20139], which then help to determine the shear and storage moduli of the medium. Methods also exist in the shear-wave literature that aim to characterize the nonlinear response of soft tissues given elastic [10\u201314] or viscoelastic [15\u201317] constitutive models and assumptions.\nInspired by such comprehensive mechanical characterization of soft tissue using group speed, phase velocity, and attenuation of shear waves as a function of frequency, we herein propose to extend similar characterization to ultrasound waves themselves. Ultrasound is a longitudinal (compressional) mechanical wave, and through its propagation in tissues, its characteristics also change based on tissue mechanical properties. Accordingly, ultrasonic group speed, phase velocity, and attenuation as a function of frequency can be used for further characterization of soft tissues. Indeed, ultrasound group speed (commonly called speed-of-sound, SoS) is related to medium bulk modulus while phase velocity and attenuation are related to bulk storage and loss moduli. Imaging of (group) SoS has been studied in the literature using tomographic approaches with custom made ultrasound transducer and data acquisition solutions in [18\u201320], which involve bulky and costly setups and submersion of the imaged anatomy in water. To utilize the practical advantages of commercial transducer arrays, SoS imaging using conventional transducers in pulse-echo mode has been proposed recently, following two approaches: A group of methods measure apparent displacements of backscattered signals when insonified from different angles [21\u201323]. Alternative methods use an additional passive acoustic reflector on the opposite side of the imaged anatomy tomeasure several time-of-flight values from which to tomographically reconstruct local SoS distribution [24,25].\nSimilarly to SoS imaging, imaging ultrasound attenuation (UA) was also proposed using custom-made water-submersion setups [18]. Using conventional ultrasound transducers, some methods utilize the fact that the ultrasound center frequency decreases as a function of propagation depth and medium UA, since attenuation affects higher frequencies more prominently. Based on this, a spectral difference method [26] and spectral log difference methods [27,28] were proposed using typical B-mode images together with reference phantom measurements. An adjacent frequency normalization was proposed in [29] to cancel out systemic effects such as focusing and time-gaincompensation without the need of reference phantom measurements. Alternatively, reference measurements from a passive acoustic mirror was used in [30,31] to estimate UA values, however this requires apriori segmentation masks to be given and hence do not allow the UA imaging of arbitrary unknown domains. Recently, imaging of local UA has been proposed in [32] using a limited-angle computed tomography (LA-CT) method.\nFormally, UA \u03b1(\u03c9) is a function of ultrasound frequency\u03c9 and it typically follows a power-law relation of the form \u03b1(\u03c9) = \u03b10\u03c9 y,\nwhere \u03b10 is called the attenuation coefficient and y the power exponent. The above-mentioned methods in the literature either estimate a single UA map, e.g., at the ultrasound transmit center frequency or estimate the attenuation coefficient \u03b10 map assuming y = 1. The latter assumption of y \u2248 1 is not necessarily valid in general as it was shown that soft tissues exhibit varying UA power exponents y [26,33]. Furthermore, using a single (center) frequency for the analysis neglects the fact that the spectral composition of propagating waves change given the larger attenuation at higher frequencies. Characterizing UA using a parametric model over a frequency range would enable a complete spectral characterization. This would allow for treating the UA variation within the utilized bandwidth as information, which is treated as noise when the underlying model is neglected. The parameters of such model can also yield additional imaging biomarkers characterizing the spectral tissue behaviour.With this motivation, recently in [34] it was proposed to reconstruct multiple UA maps (\u03b1) at different band-pass filtered frequency bands. To estimate \u03b10 and y locally, these UA maps were then pixel-wise fitted with a power-law model by assuming the UA estimates to characterize the response at the central frequency of each band. However, band-pass filtering the signal over a frequency band then averages the cumulative effect of the entire frequency band. Also, the pixel-wise model fitting ignores the spatial continuity of the image, where the individual frequency band reconstructions cannot benefit from each other and the SNR loss due to dividing into separate passbands cannot be recovered. A frequency-domain solution, similar to those in shear-wave applications and which takes into account the entire bandwidth in a single inverse problem formulation, could mitigate the above shortcomings and is proposed herein for UA reconstruction.\nSimilarly to UA, SoS also varies not only across tissues, e.g., in the human liver depending upon water, fat, and collagen concentrations [33], but also across acoustic frequencies [35\u201338]. SoS is shown to vary with respect to frequency in soft tissues in the literature [39]. For instance, it was shown in [40] that SoS varies with frequency in human brain tissues. Thus, frequency-dependent characterization of SoS may be an additional biomarker for tissue characterization.\nIn this study, we introduce a new method based on general wave theory in frequency domain to compute both SoS and UA across frequencies and compute the SoS and UA model parameters together using a inverse problem formulation. We have conducted simulations and ex-vivo phantom studies to discuss the reconstruction results."

(3b)\nwhere p represents the acoustic ray path and l is the traversed distance. \u2220Gt,r (\u03c9, \u03b8t,r) and |Gt,r (\u03c9, \u03b8t,r)| are the confounding factors attributable to transducer Tx-Rx phase and amplitude transfer characteristics at different angles (e.g., the aperture opening and side-lobes) as well as the acoustic reflector reflection characteristics, i.e., the incidence angle\ndependent specular and diffuse reflection and transmission characteristics of the reflector surface. These have to be compensated for in order to be able to measure the actual ultrasound phase velocity and attenuation effects. For this purpose, we calibrate these measurements by normalizing with measurements in water (Uwatert,r (\u03c9)) at a known water temperature and using the same ultrasound pulses (bandwidth) as in the targeted tissue imaging setup. From the given water temperature, we compute the ground-truth water SoS using the relationship in [42], which was 1,483.1 m/s in our setup. Water UA is known from [43] to be \u03b1(f) = 2.17 \u00d7 10\u221215f2.\nWe used the procedure described in [34] to compensate for the confounding effects in |Gt,r (\u03c9, \u03b8t,r)|. The reflector does not change the phase of the reflected ultrasound signals, since its acoustic impedance is higher than water and soft tissues. Thus, for factoring out the confounding effects in \u2220Gt,r(\u03c9), we used simply the phase angles of reflector echo profiles from water calibration experiments. We denote these calibrated amplitude and phase spectrum values as |Ut,r\u2032 (\u03c9)| and \u2220Ut,r\u2032 (\u03c9), respectively, which are given by\n\u2220Ut,r\u2032 \u03c9( ) \u2220Ut,r \u03c9( ) \u2212 \u2220Uwatert,r \u03c9( ) (4a) |Ut,r\u2032 \u03c9( )| Ut,r \u03c9( )Rwater \u03b8( )Uwatert,r \u03c9( )R \u03b8( ) . (4b)\nwhere Rwater(\u03b8) and R(\u03b8) are the ultrasound reflection coefficients of the reflector in water and in targeted imaging medium, respectively, for incident angle \u03b8. It can be estimated using Snell\u2019s law with the SoS in water (cwater) and an approximate SoS of the targeted medium, as in [34].\nFor acoustic propagation, refractions are herein ignored and the travel of acoustic wave from a transmitting to receiving element is modeled using a straight ray approximation as depicted in Figure 1A. For a straight acoustic path, the first wavefront from a Tx element, reflecting from the reflector and arriving at an Rx element can be assumed to follow the shortest path, thus being reflected at the mid-point between these Tx and Rx element locations projected on the reflector, cf. Figure 1A.

Sample reconstructions at three frequency values are shown in Figures 3A,B. Phase velocities for wide range of frequenciesmay exhibit complex profiles as in [50\u201352]. Nevertheless, for small ranges of ultrasound imaging frequencies, such frequency dependence can be approximated with a linear disperse model, similarly to the shear-wave phase velocity studies in [16,53]. Given the relatively small bandwidth of the utilized ultrasound pulse, the phase velocity is expected to vary linearly within this bandwidth, as illustrated by two sample profiles in Figure 3C. For frequency characterization of attenuation, it is well known in the literature that attenuation as a function of frequency obeys the power-law, which corroborates the observation inFigure 3D. One could fit these models pixel-wise for the given range frequencies and solve for the model parameters in the least square sense, as in [34]. However, this may be error prone as it ignores the spatio-spectral continuity in the medium. Herein, we incorporate frequency-dependent models of speed and attenuation into the reconstruction process, such that the inverse problem solution is informed by and can leverage the measurements at each frequency and path concurrently, while estimating the frequency-dependent medium parameters.\nAs models of the frequency-dependent nature of ultrasound phase velocity and attenuation, we use herein the following linear and power-law relations, respectively:\nc f( ) c0 + cyf (8a) \u03b1 f( ) \u03b10fy; (8b)\nwhere c(f) and \u03b1(f) are the frequency-dependent SoS and attenuation, c0 and \u03b10 the medium-specific SoS and attenuation coefficients, cy the medium-specific SoS dispersion coefficient, and y the medium-specific attenuation exponent.\nBy colocating SoS reconstructions for all measurement frequencies from Eq. 7a in Eq. 8a, a comprehensive system of equations that encodes both SoS model parameters for all image locations is arrived as follows:\n\u03b8\u0302 argmin \u03b8\n\u2016A\u03b8 \u2212 v\u20161 + \u03bb\u2016D\u2032\u03b8\u20161 (9)\nwhere \u03b8 [c0 cy]T, v [cf1 cf2 / cfn]T, D\u2032 = [D D], and\nA Inp f1pInp Inp f2pInp .. . .. .\nInp fnpInp\n\u23a1\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a3 \u23a4\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a6\nwith bold variables denoting size-np row vectors of the sought parameters in the imaged field-of-view, Inp is the identity matrix of size np and np is the total number of reconstruction grid pixels.\nFor estimating UA parameters, we colocate UA reconstructions for all measurement frequencies from Eq. 7b in Eq. 8b.

These simulations were conducted by varying local distribution of SoS and UA patterns and varying their frequency dependency characteristics. An open-source acoustics toolbox k-Wave [54] was used for this purpose. k-Wave uses Kramers\u2013Kronig relations [50\u201352] to simulate the dispersive phase speed based on given spatial maps of UA coefficient \u03b10 (x, y) and SoS cfc(x, y) at the center frequency, as well as the power-law dependency parameter y. Note that in k-Wave, y is a single constant for the entire domain/simulation and cannot be controlled spatially.\nThe transducer was simulated as a linear array of 128 elements with a pitch of 0.3 mm. Full-matrix multistatic data was simulated at a center frequency of 5 MHz with a 5-cycle input pulse. For the simulation, we used a temporal resolution of 160 MHz and a spatial grid resolution of 37.5 \u03bcm. In the physical experimental setup, the acoustic mirror is made of plexiglass, so it was simulated using plexiglass\u2019s acoustic properties (density \u03c1 = 1180 kg/m3, SoS c = 2700 m/s), as positioned at a distance of 42 mm from the transducer surface in all three simulations. A single circular inclusion with 5 mm radius is placed at the center of the imaging field-of-view. SoS at center frequency (cfc) in the background and inclusion were set, respectively, 1,540 m/s and 1,601.6 m/s (for 4% contrast). The inclusion and background attenuation coefficient (\u03b10) were set, respectively, 0.2 dB/ cm\u00b7MHzy and 0.1 dB/cm\u00b7MHzy.\nWe repeated the simulations three times by varying the power exponent y = {1.1, 1.5, 1.9}, which led to three numerical phantoms referred hereafter as sim{#1, #2, #3}, respectively. Note that given constraints in k-Wave, SoS and UA cannot be controlled independently and arbitrarily, and the variation of such exponent y changes both SoS and UA with a known relation.\n2.8 Phantom and ex-Vivo Experiments These were conducted using the data from [34]. In the first phantom #A we used, the background has 10% gelatin 1% Sigmacell Cellulose Type 50 (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States), into which a bovine skeletal muscle sample was inserted as an inclusion. For the second phantom #B, the background and inclusion compositions were interchanged, i.e., a gelatin phantom piece was inserted as the inclusion inside a bulk muscle sample. Data acquisitions were conducted on a research ultrasound machine (Verasonics, Kirkland, WA, United States) with a 128-element linear-array transducer (Philips, ATL L7-4). Similarly to the simulation setup, a wideband Tx pulse with a center frequency of 5.2 MHz and a pulse length of five cycles was used. For the calibration procedure, multi-static data sets were acquired in distilled water at room temperature by placing the reflector at multiple depths {31, 35, 39, 43, 47}mm. For any intermediate reflector depths used in the phantom measurements, calibration data was interpolated from the available water measurements above, as described in [32]."

            "text": "First, the reflector profiles are delineated in the multistatic data for each Tx event using [41]. To identify the acoustic reflector surface, we tuned this reflector delineation framework to use the so-called \u201cedge\u201d feature with a window length of 200 and 50, respectively, for simulations and ex-vivo experiments. A cubic RANSAC [55] model was used for outlier removal, to estimate an initial contour, which was next refined using an optimizationbased active contours [56] method, which hence utilizes the expected temporal continuity of the neighbouring profiles for a robust estimation. This then yields the final delineation of reflector echoes to estimate the time-of-flights as well as the temporal echo profiles around the delineated reflector surface (to further process) as exemplified in Figure 1C. This delineation procedure was repeated for all 128 Tx events. For each delineated reflector profile of a Tx-Rx combination, 43 RF samples (within which the surface echo is observed, also corresponding roughly to the 5 cycles of a Tx pulse) around the delineated location is taken out, zero-pad to 128 samples, and input to a 1-D temporal Fourier transform using FFT, leading to a spectral resolution of 312.5 and 325.5 kHz, respectively, for simulations and ex-vivo experiments. The above yields phase and amplitude spectrums, as exemplified in Figures 2A,B. Repeating this for all Tx-Rx combinations yields 128 \u00d7 128 spectrum profiles for phase and amplitude. Next, phase and amplitude values at a frequency of interest are extracted and calibrated using the respective calibration parameters, derived separately for (simulated) numerical and physical experiments. From the calibrated measurements for all Tx-Rx combinations, SoS and UA maps are reconstructed using Eqs 7\u20139).\nSystemmatrix L is constant for given transducer geometry and reflector position. It, however, needs to be recomputed if the reflector distance changes, e.g., based on the imaged organ\u2019s physical dimension. Nevertheless, L can be precomputed for several potential imaging distances and loaded at imaging time based on the current reflector distance. It is further possible to have a reflector setup where physical distances are constrained mechanically to certain increments as in [45]. Reconstruction of SoS or UA at a single frequency takes \u22488.2 s. Assuming that this can be parallelized for multiple frequencies we utilize and by using L and D matrices precomputed for a given distance, then our proposed reconstruction including preprocessing for reflector delineation and postprocessing by parameter fitting would take 12.6 s, using unoptimized MATLAB code. Single frequency reconstructions or the overall parameter estimation can be accelerated to real-time via loop-unrolling of tomographic reconstruction using variational networks as in [57,58].\nWe assume that reconstructions are thin planar slices, although ultrasound propagation has a finite elevational thickness, e.g. attenuations caused by out-of-plane structures. Nevertheless, such out-of-plane effects are less likely to affect measurements with a reflector where only specular (direct) reflections arrive back at a receive element."

From the ground-truth and reconstructed SoS maps at the center frequency in Figures 4A,B, it can be seen that the background SoS at the center frequency is reconstructed with some success in all cases. However, the inclusion SoS values are seen to be shifted towards background values, which corroborates the findings in [25]. This is due to the limited-angle tomographic nature of the problem, where the lack of lateral projections combined with the regularization needed for robust solutions cause the smoothing and axial elongation of the inclusions, hence spreading them over a larger area. Since the cumulative SoS effect shall stay the same, per-pixel inclusion values are effectively averaged with the background, inversely proportional to such artifactual area increase.\nNote that as y varies across the simulations, so does cy, according to Kramers\u2013Kronig relationship [51]. Therefore, the cy maps in Figures 4D are expected to present contrast between the three simulations with different y values. An analytical computation of expected SoS dispersion in the utilized frequency range of 4\u20136 MHz according to the Kramers\u2013Kronig relationship is illustrated in Figure 5. Accordingly, in this frequency range a linear SoS dispersion (cy) of {6.5, 9.7, 5.3}\ncm/s\u00b7MHz for the background and {14.1, 21.0, 11.4} cm/s\u00b7MHz for the inclusion are expected for each respective simulation. These are used as ground-truth cy values for the following evaluation.\nFor a quantitative evaluation, we computed the metrics RMSE, CNR, and CRF for each simulation, as reported in Table 1. We computed the mean and standard deviation for the background and inclusion using their respective masks from simulations. The average RMSE of c (fc) is 8.50 \u00b1 0.24 m/s and the average mean values of c (fc) in the background region is 1,542.3 \u00b1 0.1 m/s, demonstrating that an accurate reconstruction of the speed of sound is possible. The contrast metrics CNR and CRF for c (fc) and for c0 indicate that the inclusions can be successfully distinguished in SoS reconstructions, with a contrast similar to their prescribed ground-truth value. Note that cy reconstructions for all the simulations show large RMSE errors of 39\u201353 cm/ s\u00b7MHz. This is mainly due to the relatively minute dispersion values of [5.3\u20139.7] cm/s\u00b7MHz and hence their minimal effect in SoS change within the given frequency interval (see the changes in y-axis in Figure 5 being < 0.4 m/s for inclusion < 0.2 m/s for the background). Note that this is partly due to our earlier-mentioned experimental limitations with k-Wave parameterizations, where SoS frequency dispersion can only be generated by varying y,\nFrontiers in Physics | www.frontiersin.org May 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 8607258\nwhich then has a much more prominent impact on UA. To capture such variation, very high SNR and precision would be required in SoS reconstructions. Despite the accuracy being low for these, nevertheless, the relative differences and contrasts are recovered successfully: For instance, cy for the inclusion of sim #2\nis higher than that of sim #1 and #3, which corroborates the analytical expectation from Figure 5. Similarly, corroborating the analytical expectation, the inclusions in sim #1 and #2 show roughly twice the dispersion that their backgrounds. The average ratio of \u03bc\ncy inc to \u03bc cy bg is \u22482.4, which is close to the ground truth cy\nFrontiers in Physics | www.frontiersin.org May 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 8607259\ncontrast of 2 between inclusion and background. Therefore, despite not being accurate reconstructed cy values are still correlated with ground truth counter-parts and hence may potentially act as an imaging biomarker.\nReconstructed UA at the center frequency \u03b1fc, UA coefficient \u03b10, and exponent y are plotted in Figure 6. Given the groundtruth and reconstructed \u03b1fc maps in Figures 6A,B, it can be seen that the UA at center frequency is successfully reconstructed in all cases. In Figures 6B,C it is observed that the reconstructed \u03b1fc and \u03b10 values in the inclusions are shifted towards the background values, similarly to SoS results in Figure 4B and also in line with previous observations in [34]. The UA exponent y maps in Figure 6C should not present any contrast since the power exponent y are constant across each domain. Although this is true for sim #1, the other two simulations exhibit a slight deviation of y in the inclusion region. This is due to the relatively more pronounced artifactual elongations of the inclusion in UA reconstructions with increased frequency dispersion, which then slightly reduce the per-pixel reconstructed UA value (through averaging as reasoned above), which in turn is erroneously attributed by the model fitting to an increased y in the inclusion.\nTo quantify UA reconstructions, we report RMSE, CNR, and CRF in Table 1. Average RMSE of \u03b1(fc) is 0.16 \u00b1 0.09 dB/ cm at center frequency 5 MHz. Considering the range of\nground-truth SoS values, this demonstrates that an accurate reconstruction of UA is possible. With an RMSE of {0.04, 0.05, 0.06} respectively for prescribed y values {1.1, 1.5, 1.9}, the relative estimation error becomes below 3.3%, indicating a robust estimation of frequency exponent y. The contrast metrics CNR and CRF for \u03b1(fc), \u03b10, and y demonstrate that the inclusions can be successfully distinguished in UA reconstructions, with a contrast similar to their prescribed ground-truth values.\n3.2 Ex-Vivo Experiments Results The SoS reconstruction results of the gelatin phantom and exvivo experiments are shown in Figure 7 with their corresponding B-Mode images in Figure 7A. Reconstructions of SoS maps at the center frequency are shown in Figure 7B, while reconstructed c0 and cy are shown in Figures 7C,D. The reconstructed results in Figure 7B were overlaid with inclusion markings annotated from the B-mode images. A clear contrast is visible in Figure 7 for all our proposed reconstructions. The reconstructed maps c (fc) and cy for gelatin and bovine tissue regions are consistent in phantoms #A and #B; i.e., the reconstructions show inverted images between these two phantoms, indicating that these quantities can be reproducibly used for tissue differentiation. From Figure 7C, it is observed that the tissue samples show much higher\nFrontiers in Physics | www.frontiersin.org May 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 86072510\ndispersion than in the simulations. This indicates the selection of frequency for SoS quantification being an important factor in practice. This also signifies the need for imaging C0 and Cy to image the SoS of the targeted medium comprehensively. In other words, UA dispersion estimation can help both as additional parameters to characterize tissues and also for disambiguation of SoS measurement, which are seen here to\nbe highly frequency dependent; also corroborating tissue observations in the literature, e.g. [33,39].\nThe UA results of the gelatin phantom and ex-vivo experiments are shown in Figure 8. A clear contrast is visible for all the UA reconstructions using our proposed methods. Furthermore, all three reconstructed parameters between phantoms #A and #B are consistent, i.e., inclusion and\nFrontiers in Physics | www.frontiersin.org May 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 86072511\nbackground values inverted, showing reproducibility under different experimental settings. Axial edge artifacts, especially in y and \u03b10 maps were much reduced compared to results in [34] thanks to solving model parameters collectively in a closed form as in Eq. 9. The average and standard deviation values of SoS and UA obtained in gelatin and bovine tissue were tabulated along with CNR of the reconstructions in Table 2.\nUsing the relationship in Eq. 11, the complex bulk modulus of the gelatin phantom and ex-vivo tissues at ultrasound center frequency can be computed to be 2.31 + i (2.42 \u00d7 10\u20133) GPa and 2.33 + i (10.01 \u00d7 10\u20133) GPa, respectively. These values indicate 1) that the bulk loss modulus in both media is three orders of magnitude smaller than the bulk storage modulus; and 2) that although both media have similar bulk storage modulus, the bulk loss modulus in ex-vivo bovine tissue is \u22484 times higher than that of gelatin. This striking difference indicates that the complex bulk modulus may act as a new imaging biomarker, where the loss modulus component potentially having superior tissue differentiation compared to its storage component."

            "text": "In this study, a novel method for reconstructing local SoS and UA maps as a function of frequency is introduced, through frequency domain analysis followed by a closed-form fitting of linear SoS and power-law UA dependency models. We first delineate the reflector profiles in multi-static data and compute Fourier transforms of these profiles to estimate phase and amplitude spectra. After calibrating these with water measurements, we use them to solve closed-form inverse problems over all frequencies to reconstruct SoS and UA frequency-dependent model parameters. We have studied these reconstructions with simulations and ex-vivo phantom studies, with our results indicating the following observations: The introduced SoS model parameters c(fc) (SoS at center frequency), c0 (SoS intercept), and cy (SoS dispersion) were reconstructed with average RMSEs of 8.50 \u00b1 0.24 m/s, 9.30 \u00b1 0.31 m/s, and 47.6 \u00b1 7.3 cm/s\u00b7MHz, respectively. These results show that c (fc) and c0 can be reconstructed with high accuracy,\nwhile cy reconstructions were relatively poorer within the simulated low-dispersion regime. Still, the reconstructed cy maps and their contrasts correlated with the ground-truth values. UA model parameters \u03b1(fc), \u03b10, and y were reconstructed with average RMSEs of 0.16 \u00b1 0.1 dB/cm, 0.01 \u00b1 0dB/cm\u00b7MHzy, and 0.05 \u00b1 0.01, respectively, which indicate a high overall reconstruction accuracy using our proposed methods. From phantom and ex-vivo tissue sample experiments, the attenuation exponents in a gelatin-cellulose mixture and an ex-vivo bovine muscle sample were found to be, respectively, 1.3 and 0.6 on average. Linear dispersion of SoS in a gelatin-cellulose mixture and an ex-vivo bovine muscle sample were found to be, respectively, 1.3 and 4.0 m/s\u00b7MHz on average. Bulk loss modulus in bovine muscle sample was \u22484 times the bulk loss modulus in the gelatin-cellulose mixture. Our results show the feasibility of estimating spatial maps of frequencydependent characteristics of SoS and UA, as well as the complex bulk modulus as potential imaging biomarkers.\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/Supplementary Materials, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nBC contributed with data processing, analysis and discussion of results, and manuscript drafting.
