    "abstractText": "This article presents a general-purpose model that enables efficient and accurate calculation of third-order nonlinear signals in surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices. This model is based on piezoelectric constitutive equations combined with perturbation theory, which can be analyzed by full finite element method (FEM). For validation, third-order harmonic (H3) responses and intermodulation distortions (IMD3) in SAW resonators are simulated, and their calculation results fit well to experimental data in the literature. Then, the generation mechanisms of the third-order nonlinearity in SAW resonators are discussed. The dominant generation mechanisms for different nonlinear signals and the relation between electrode materials and H3 peak magnitude are revealed, which provides an important guideline for further nonlinear suppression.",

Introduction\nSurface acoustic wave and bulk acoustic wave (SAW/BAW) devices used as radio frequency (RF) front-end filters and duplexers are mass-produced and applied in telecommunication systems [1,2]. Recent advances in mobile communication technologies have led to multiple signal handling, downsizing, and higher power level operations [3]. In this circumstance, the nonlinearity in SAW/BAW has become an important issue, as it generates harmonic and intermodulation distortion (IMD) products, which result in noticeable signal distortions [4\u20136]. Numerous groups have made efforts to investigate the nonlinearity in SAW/BAW devices and its suppression. For BAW devices, the one-dimensional (1D) Mason equivalent circuit model and modified Butterworth Van Dyke (MBVD) model are commonly employed [3,7,8]. Shim and Feld [9] proposed a 1D nonlinear Mason model using the harmonic balance (HB) technique [10,11]. The proposed Mason model is applicable to arbitrary piezoelectric nonlinear sources, and it simulates well for nonlinear signals generated in RF BAW. Considering the nonlinearity in RF BAW devices is extremely weak, Hashimoto et al. [12,13] pointed out that the perturbation method should be more applicable than the HB method. They demonstrated that the nonlinear behaviors of the thickness extensional resonators for both 1D and 2D cases are accurately simulated by the MBVD model with the first-order perturbation method. Chen et al. [14,15] also applied the\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 1116. https://doi.org/10.3390/mi13071116 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/micromachines\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 1116 2 of 12\nabove method to calculate third-order nonlinear distortion of SAW duplexers. The validity and accuracy were established by comparing simulation and measurement results. As for SAW devices, the classical coupling-of-modes (COM) and P-matrix model methods are widely used to characterize their nonlinear behaviors. Nakagawa et al. [16] derived a COM model by introducing the nonlinear stress and electric displacement to identify the contributions from different mechanisms to nonlinearity in SAW devices. Furthermore, Chauhan et al. [17,18] extended it to P-matrix formalism to analyze that of the temperature compensated SAW (TC-SAW) devices on 128\u25e6 YX LiNbO3 substrate. In the latest publications, a finite element method (FEM) model was applied by Mayer et al. [19], Guan et al. [20] and Pang et al. [21] to study the intermodulation and harmonic generation in LiNbO3 based SAW resonators. However, the above nonlinear FEM models are limited to SAW resonators on piezoelectric substrate such as Quartz and LiNbO3, whose higher-order material constants are known. This means they have difficulty in analyzing the cases when higher-order material constants are unknown, for example, the commercial commonly used LiTaO3. With the coming of the 5G era, SAW/BAW and hybrid SAW-BAW devices with complicated structures are emerging one after another. Although the above publications have illustrated the generation mechanisms of nonlinearity and proposed several nonlinearity suppression methods, a general-purpose and efficient simulation tool for both SAW and BAW devices is still absent. In our previous work [22], we proposed a full FEM model for analyzing nonlinearity in BAW resonators and verified its effectiveness. Therefore, in this paper, we extend this model to calculate nonlinearity in SAW resonators. Theoretical derivations of this method are based on piezoelectric constitutive equations and perturbation theory, by which multiple piezoelectric nonlinearity can be considered simultaneously and combined arbitrarily. Compared to the previous FEM model [19\u201321], the advantage of the proposed model is that it not only inherently has the universality of a finite element, but also remains effective even if higher-order material constants of piezoelectric substrate are unknown. Validations were made by comparing the third-order nonlinear responses obtained by the proposed method with experimental results in the literature qualitatively. In addition, possible nonlinearity generation mechanisms and their suppression are discussed.\n2. Theoretical Background and Analysis Procedures 2.1. Linear Equations of Piezoelectricity\nWe start by linear cases for piezoelectric resonators, the linear constitutive equations with charge-stress form (namely e-form) describe piezoelectric coupling as follows:\nT = cES\u2212 eE (1)\nAnd D = eS + \u03b5SE (2)\nwhere T, S, E and D are the stress, strain, electric field and electric displacement, respectively, and cE, e and \u03b5S are the elastic stiffness constant under constant E, piezoelectric coefficient and dielectric constant under constant S, respectively. Note that the subscripts of variables and material constants were omitted to simplify the following derivation.\nThe motion of the piezoelectric body is governed by Newton\u2019s second law:\n\u2207 \u00b7 T = \u03c1 \u2202 2u\n\u2202t2 (3)\nwhere \u03c1 is the mass density and u is displacement, and the charge equation of electrostatics is given by:\n\u2207 \u00b7 D = 0 (4)\nTherefore, the electric displacement D is spatially uniform.\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 1116 3 of 12\n2.2. Nonlinear Equations of Piezoelectricity\nOn the basis of the perturbation theory [23], we modify the linear piezoelectric constitutive equations by introducing the nonlinear stress TN and the nonlinear electric displacement DN perturbations as follows:\nT = cES\u2212 eE + TN (5)\nAnd D = eS + \u03b5SE + DN (6)\nwhere TN and DN can be represented as a series consisting of integer powers of their variables S and E. According to the thermodynamics of solids [24], we derived the expression of perturbation terms TN and DN by expanding Helmholz free energy A until the fourth-order terms of strain S and electric field E:\nTN = 1 2! ( \u22023 A \u2202S3 ) S2 + ( \u22023 A \u2202S2\u2202E ) SE + 1 2! ( \u22023 A \u2202S\u2202E2 ) E2\n+ 1 3! ( \u22024 A \u2202S4 ) S3 + 1 2 ( \u22024 A \u2202S3\u2202E ) S2E + 1 2 ( \u22024 A \u2202S2\u2202E2 ) SE2 + 1 3! ( \u22024 A \u2202S\u2202E3 ) E3\n(7)\nAnd\nDN =\u2212 1 2!\n( \u22023 A\n\u2202S2\u2202E\n) S2 \u2212 ( \u22023 A\n\u2202S\u2202E2\n) SE\u2212 1\n2! ( \u22023 A \u2202E3 ) E2\n\u2212 1 3!\n( \u22024 A\n\u2202S3\u2202E\n) S3 \u2212 1\n2\n( \u22024 A\n\u2202S2\u2202E2\n) S2E\u2212 1\n2\n( \u22024 A\n\u2202S\u2202E3\n) SE2 \u2212 1\n3! ( \u22024 A \u2202E4 ) E3\n(8)\nEquations (7) and (8) are then rewritten as Equations (9) and (10), respectively, as follows:\nTN = 1 2 \u03c7T20S 2 + \u03c7T11SE + 1 2 \u03c7T02E 2\n+ 1 6 \u03c7T30S 3 + 1 2 \u03c7T21S 2E + 1 2 \u03c7T12SE 2 + 1 6 \u03c7T03E 3\n(9)\nAnd DN =\u2212\n1 2 \u03c7T11S 2 \u2212 \u03c7T02SE\u2212 1 2 \u03c7D02E 2\n\u22121 6 \u03c7T21S 3 \u2212 1 2 \u03c7T12S 2E\u2212 1 2 \u03c7T03SE 2 \u2212 1 6 \u03c7D03E\n3 (10)\nwhere \u03c7Tij and \u03c7 D ij are nonlinear coefficients, and the superscripts \u201cT\u201d and \u201cD\u201d indicate contributions of TN and DN . Note that the dominated terms in TN and DN expressions are related to the order of nonlinearity under consideration.\nSubstituting Equations (5) and (6) into Equations (3) and (4) derives:\n\u2207\u00b7 ( cES\u2212 eE ) \u2212 \u03c1 \u2202\n2u \u2202t2 = \u2212\u2207\u00b7TN (11)\nAnd \u2207\u00b7 ( eS + \u03b5SE ) = \u2212\u2207\u00b7DN (12)\nNonlinear responses in the piezoelectric resonator can be determined by linear partial differential equations of Equations (11) and (12) where the terms on the right-hand side are taken as perturbations.\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 1116 4 of 12\n2.3. Derivation of Third-Order Nonlinear Responses\nFor simplicity, it is assumed that the excitation with two different frequency components f1 and f2 are applied to a piezoelectric resonator. Therefore, the linear strain and electric field in piezoelectric material are expressed as:\nS = S f1 + S f2 (13)\nAnd E = E f1 + E f2 (14)\nThe perturbations caused by nonlinear products including intermodulation distortions and harmonics responses can be estimated by substituting Equations (13) and (14) into Equations (9) and (10). The nonlinear stress TN and nonlinear electric displacement DN for third-order harmonics (H3) are derived as:\nT3 f1N = 1 6 \u03c7T30S 3 f1 + 1 2 \u03c7T21S 2 f1 E f1 + 1 2 \u03c7T12S f1 E 2 f1 + 1 6 \u03c7T03E 3 f1 (15)\nAnd D3 f1N = \u2212 1 6 \u03c7T21S 3 f1 \u2212 1 2 \u03c7T12S 2 f1 E f1 \u2212 1 2 \u03c7T03S f1 E 2 f1 \u2212 1 6 \u03c7D03E 3 f1 (16)\nIn a similar way, the expressions of TN and DN for third-order intermodulation distortions (IMD3) cases are derived as:\nT2 f1\u00b1 f2N = 1 2 \u03c7T30S 2 f1 S f2\n+ 1 2 \u03c7T21 ( 2S f1 E f1 S f2 + S 2 f1 E f2 ) +\n1 2 \u03c7T12 ( 2S f1 E f1 E f2 + S f2 E 2 f1 ) +\n1 2 \u03c7T03E 2 f1 E f2\n(17)\nAnd D2 f1\u00b1 f2N =\u2212 1 2 \u03c7T21S 2 f1 S f2\n\u22121 2 \u03c7T12 ( 2S f1 E f1 S f2 + S 2 f1 E f2 ) \u22121\n2 \u03c7T03\n( 2S f1 E f1 E f2 + S f2 E 2 f1 ) \u22121\n2 \u03c7D03E 2 f1 E f2\n(18)\nIt is noted that perturbation terms TN and DN in Equations (5) and (6) are composed by the combination of the electrostatic field, the strain field, and the mixing of the strain field and the electrostatic field [25], which can be selectively estimated by choosing specific expressions from Equations (15)\u2013(18) for different nonlinear responses.\n2.4.

For modeling of this device, a quasi-3D periodic FEM model (shown in Figure 1b) is built and used for numerical simulations by using a built-in piezoelectric module of FEM software COMSOL Multiphysics 5.6, as two-dimensional (2D) models are insufficient in analyzing the horizontal shear field component along the aperture y-direction.

Generation Mechanisms f Third-Order Nonlinearity\nNo li ear effects i elasticity, dielectric, and electro-m chanical coupling such as piezoelectricity and electrostriction will contribute to nonlinear signals generated in SAW\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 1116 8 of 12\ndevices. To find the dominant contributions to third-order nonlinearity, nonlinear terms composed of different nonlinear coefficients \u03c7ij combined with strain S and electric field E were investigated, respectively. Linear strain and electric field components of Syz and Ez were used as they are expected to be the predominant components for SH-type SAW. Similarly, Txy and Dz were selected and added as perturbations. Figure 5a\u2013c illustrate the separate contributions of different nonlinear terms to the simulation results shown in Figure 4a\u2013c, respectively. Perturbations in DN are considered for the H3 and IMD3 2 f1 + f2 cases as their output frequency f fr, and that in TN are used for the IMD3 2 f1 \u2212 f2 case as the output frequency is adjacent to the resonant frequency fr. For the H3 simulation shown in Figure 5a, nonlinear terms \u03c7T21S 3 yz, \u03c7T03SyzE 2 z and \u03c7D03E 3 z in Dz are of significant contributions, whereas the effect of \u03c7T12S 2 yzEz is negligible. \u03c7T21S 3 yz term contributes to a simple peak dependency of the H3 curve, and the notch at about 2.6 GHz in Figure 5a is mainly caused by the coupling effect of nonlinear terms \u03c7T21S 3 yz and \u03c7D03E 3 z . Thus, nonlinear piezoelectricity and dielectric represented by \u03c7T21S 3 yz and \u03c7D03E 3 z , respectively, are predominant for H3 generation. For the simulation of IMD3 2 f1\u2212 f2 response shown in Figure 5b, only \u03c7T30S 3 yz in Txy matters and the contributions from the other three nonlinear terms are insignificant. It means nonlinear elasticity induced by \u03c7T30S 3 yz is responsible for the IMD3 2 f1\u2212 f2 response in the SAW resonator. As for the simulation of the IMD3 2 f1 + f2 response shown in Figure 5c, \u03c7T21S 3 yz, \u03c7T03SyzE 2 z in Dz are dominant in this case, and effects from the other two nonlinear terms can be neglected. Namely, nonlinear piezoelectricity caused by \u03c7T21S 3 yz are also the major source of IMD3 2 f1 + f2 generation. It is concluded that the nonlinear effect of acoustic strain, i.e., S3 terms in Equations (9) and (10), contributes to both H3 and IMD3 responses considerably. Therefore, nonlinear elasticity and piezoelectricity generated by acoustic strain are the dominant sources for third-order nonlinear responses of SAW devices.\nMicromachines 2022, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 12\ncomposed of different nonlinear coefficients \ud835\udf12\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57 combined with strain \ud835\udc46 and electric field \ud835\udc38 were inv stigated, respectively.

Perturbations in \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc41 are considered for the H3 and IMD3 2\ud835\udc531 + \ud835\udc532 cases as their output frequency \ud835\udc53 \u226b \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc5f, and that in \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc41 are used for the IMD3 2\ud835\udc531 \u2212 \ud835\udc532 case as the output frequency is adjacent to the resonant frequency \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc5f. For the H3 simulation shown in Figure 5a, nonlinear terms \ud835\udf1221 \ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc67 3 , \ud835\udf1203 \ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc67 2 and \ud835\udf1203 \ud835\udc37 \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc67 3 in \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc67 are of significant contributions, whereas the effect of \ud835\udf1212 \ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc67 2 \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc67 is negligible. \ud835\udf1221 \ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc67 3 term contributes to a simple peak dependency of the H3 curve, and the notch at about 2.6 GHz in Figure 5a is mainly caused by the coupling effect of nonlinear terms \ud835\udf1221 \ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc67 3 and \ud835\udf1203 \ud835\udc37 \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc67 3. Thus, nonlinear piezoelectricity and dielectric represented by \ud835\udf1221 \ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc67 3 and \ud835\udf1203 \ud835\udc37 \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc67 3, respectively, are predominant for H3 generation. For the simulation of IMD3 2\ud835\udc531 \u2212 \ud835\udc532 response shown in Figure 5b, only \ud835\udf1230 \ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc67 3 in \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc66 matters and the contributions from the other three nonlinear terms are insignificant. It means nonlinear elasticity induced by \ud835\udf1230 \ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc67 3 is responsible for the IMD3 2\ud835\udc531 \u2212 \ud835\udc532 response in the SAW resonator. As for the simulation of the IMD3 2\ud835\udc531 + \ud835\udc532 response shown in Figure 5c, \ud835\udf1221 \ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc67 3 , \ud835\udf1203 \ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc67 2 in \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc67 are dominant in this case, and effects from the other two nonlinear terms can be neglected. Namely, nonlinear piezoelectricity caused by \ud835\udf1221 \ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc67 3 are also the major source of IMD3 2\ud835\udc531 + \ud835\udc532 generation. It is concluded that the nonlinear effect of acoustic strain, i.e., \ud835\udc463 terms in Equations (9) and (10), contributes to both H3 and IMD3 responses\nconsiderably. Therefore, nonlinear elasticity and piezoelectricity generated by acoustic\nstrain are the dominant sources for third-order nonlinear responses of SAW devices.\nFigure 5.

Nonlinearity Suppression\nIn the last section, we point out that the third-order nonlinear signals of SAW devices are generated by nonlinear elasticity dominantly. Nakagawa et al. [26] also investigated the effect of different Ti layer thicknesses on H3 generation in SAW resonators with Al/Ti layered electrodes, which consist of metals with different elastic constants. Furthermore, they demonstrated that the H3 response of the SAW resonator decreases obviously with an increase in the thickness of the adhesive layer, Ti. Similarly, we calculated the H3 signals of SAW resonators on 42-LT with three different Cu/Ti electrode structures, and the designed layer thicknesses are given in Table 1. As shown in Figure 6, the variation in H3 magnitude with Ti layer thickness is consistent with [26].\nTable 1.

Figure 7 shows the simulated H3 results of the SAW resonators on 42-LT substrate with different electrode materials listed in Table 2. It is seen that the H3 curves in Figure 7 exhibit similar frequency dependence with those curves shown in the above Figure 4a. Then, Figure 8a compares the H3 peak values corresponding to different electrode materials in this calculation. These values are arranged in ascending order of Young\u2019s modulus, and the values of c12 and c44 are organized in same order as well in Figure 8b. As shown, the H3 peak curve has the same trend as the c12 curve, except for the values of c44 being closer to or greater than c12. This means the larger one of the two independent elastic constants c12 and c44 possesses a more dominant contribution for H3 generation. It should be noted that the H3 peak can be suppressed by about 25 dBm by choosing proper electrode materials, which provides a vital insight into improving the linearity of SAW devices.\nMicromachines 2022, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 12\nSAW resonators on 42-LT substrate with different electrode materials listed in Table 2.

Conclusions\nIn this paper, we proposed a general FEM model for analyzing third-order nonlinear signals in RF SAW resonators based on perturbation theory. For validation, simulations of the H3 response and IMD3 response for a SAW resonator on 42-LT substrate are performed. The comparison of simulation results with measured results in the literature demonstrated the accuracy of the proposed model. The generation mechanisms of third-order nonlinearity in SAW resonators are discussed in detail and the dominant mechanisms are distinguished to give a guideline for further nonlinear suppression. In particular, the relation between elastic constants of electrode materials and H3 peak value is concluded. Additionally, due to the generality of the proposed nonlinear FEM model, this model could be extended to analyze the nonlinearity of SAW/BAW devices based on arbitrary structure configurations and materials for further study.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, Q.Z.; methodology, Q.Z. and L.Q.; validation, B.L., S.Z. and Q.Z.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, B.L.; writing\u2014review and editing, B.L., Q.Z. and S.F.; supervision, Q.Z., S.F. and W.W.; project administration, X.Z.; funding acquisition, Q.Z. and X.Z.
