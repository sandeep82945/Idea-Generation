    "abstractText": "The Helium-3 shortage and the growing interest in neutron science constitute a driving factor in developing new neutron detection technologies. In this work, we report the development of a double-GEM detector prototype that uses a B4C layer as a neutron converter material. GEANT4 simulations were performed predicting an efficiency of (3.14 \u00b1 0.10) %, agreeing within 2.7\u03c3 with the experimental and analytic detection efficiencies obtained by the detector when tested in a 41.8 meV thermal neutron beam. The detector is position sensitive, equipped with a 256+256 strip readout connected to resistive chains, and achieves a spatial resolution better than 3 mm. The gain stability over time was also measured with a fluctuation of about 0.2 % h\u22121 of the signal amplitude. A simple data acquisition with only 5 electronic channels is sufficient to operate this detector.",

            "text": "Several advances in scattering techniques inspired the interest in neutron science, which provides different applications in areas such as chemistry, physics, biology, medicine and engineering research. These advances are strongly dependent on detector developments, which has also grown in the last years, along with the capability to obtain bright monochromatic neutron sources, whether in large or small facilities [1\u20134]. The 3He proportional counter is one of the most widely used type of neutron detectors, still widely used. Beyond its historical tradition, it presents several advantages, such as the large neutron capture cross-section (\ud835\udf0e = 5325 b for 25 meV [5]), low sensitivity to gamma-rays, and the possibility of working on a wide neutron energy range in the low energy region [1]. However, due to a shortage of this gas since the early 2000s [6], the scientific community keeps searching for alternative solutions with 3He-free detectors [7], employing 113Cd , 157Gd , 10B, and 6Li [8\u201312] as neutron converters. Nevertheless, substituting 3He has the price of reducing the neutron detection efficiency or increasing the detection complexity. One versatile alternative for neutron detection consists of using one of the referred neutron converter isotopes with the Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) [13], a microstructure widely used to detect charged particles that can cover large sensitive areas, present fair energy and position resolutions as well as robustness. These aspects consolidated these microstructures, which are already in use in several applications, such as high energy physics [14\u201316], muon tomography [17], X-rays fluorescence imaging [18], and, more recently, neutron detection [19\u201322]. This work presents a double-GEM detector which uses 10B4C as a neutron converter, deposited on its aluminum cathode. The ionizing products generated by the 10B(n,\ud835\udefc)7Li capture reaction, shown in Eq. 1.1, are a critical factor in detector\u2019s design. Given that 10B has a relatively large neutron capture cross section of 3870 b for 25 meV [5] and about 19 % natural abundance [23], one\n\u2013 1 \u2013\nof its compounds, 10B4C, is particularly interesting for our purposes, considering it also presents good wear resistance besides chemical and thermal stability [24].\nn + 10B \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 {\n7Li (840 keV) + 4He (1470 keV) + \ud835\udefe (480 keV) (94%) 7Li (1015 keV) + 4He (1775 keV) (6%)\n(1.1)\nThis prototype can be easily assembled and offers the possibility to cover large areas, an essential requirement for some applications. The detector was tested in the IEA-R1 nuclear research reactor [25], at the Nuclear and Energy Research Institute (IPEN) in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, using a monochromatic thermal neutron beam. Its versatility resulted from quickly obtaining neutron position sensitivity using a few electronics channels and presenting gain stability."

            "text": "Our double-GEM detector is composed of a stack with a 0.5 mm thick aluminum cathode coated with amorphous enriched boron carbide (10B4C ), followed by two GEM foils, provided by CERN.\nThe deposition of the 10B4C film on the Al cathode was done by direct-current magnetron sputtering in ESS Link\u00f6ping Detector Coatings Workshop, located at Link\u00f6ping, Sweden. The facility is equipped with an industrial deposition unit (CC800/9, CemeCon AG) and has been dedicated to the development and production of B4C coatings as the solid converting layers in neutron detectors. Details about the deposition machine and characterization of the B4C thin films for neutron detectors can be found in [24, 26, 27].\nIn this work, two 10B4C targets (10B enrichment > 95 wt.%) were installed on sputtering cathodes in the deposition machine. The Al plate was attached to another Al backing plate to achieve 10B4C coating on only one surface, where the whole assembly was mounted to an electrically grounded sample table (see Fig. 1). The system was first pumped down to a primary vacuum pressure of 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22124 Pa (1.1 \u00d7 10\u22126 Torr) while the Al plate was heated up to 280 \u00b0C for 3 h mainly to remove the water residuals on the surfaces. After an additional 2 h cooling, the plate was then treated with radio frequency plasma etching in 0.35 Pa of pure Ar to improve the coating\u2019s adhesion by removing native oxides on the substrate surface and increasing surface roughness. Thereafter, the system was filled up with 0.8 Pa (6 mTorr) of Ar before the beginning of the 10B4C deposition. During the deposition, the sample table was continuously rotated to obtain a better thickness uniformity. A polished Si reference was mounted at an equivalent position of the Al plate in the same deposition run for thickness measurement of the coating and the thickness of 10B4C coating was measured to be approximately 2.2 \u00b5m by a profilometer (DektakXT, Bruker).\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nIn addition to the deposition of the converter layer, the geometrical disposition of the elements within the detector is a key factor regarding the signal we want to measure. The drift, transfer, and induction regions of our prototype are represented in Fig. 2. The drift region has 2 mm thickness and is biased with 100 V, while the transfer and induction regions have both 1 mm thickness and are biased with 300 V and 400 V, respectively. The detector works under an open flow of an Ar/CO2 (90/10) gas mixture, with a flow of 6 L/h through the 0.85 L volume aluminum chamber. The readout plane, produced at CERN, consists of 256+256 strips in X and Y directions, covering a 100 cm2 sensitive area.\nThe thickness of the drift region determines the detector\u2019s sensitivity to background gamma rays. In this context, a common requirement for thermal neutron detectors is to be insensitive to these gammas. Preliminary tests comparing 20 mm and 2 mm drift regions have shown that the latter detected five times fewer background events (approximately 3 Hz), measured with the neutron beam shutter closed. The share of events within the background range varied from 56 % for the\n\u2013 3 \u2013\n20 mm drift region to 18 % for the 2 mm region. These tests were taken into account to determine the current 100 keV threshold, which allows the detector to operate above the gamma contamination region. Therefore, we operated the detector using the 2 mm drift region, which is possible because the reaction products\u2019 high ionization power generates a large number of primary electrons. That way, even a tiny segment of their tracks is enough to provide a significant signal.\nThe signal multiplied by the GEM stack is collected by 256+256 strips, which are interconnected by a resistive chain composed of 60\u03a9 Surface Mount Device (SMD) resistors with 0.1 % precision, as shown in Fig. 3. There are five signals collected to reconstruct a neutron image: two signals for the X direction, two for the Y direction and the charge signal, collected from the bottom electrode of the last GEM. The charge signal is used as the trigger for the data acquisition, as shown in Fig. 4, since it is position-independent, coming directly from the multiplication. Considering the expected extraction efficiency \ud835\udf16ext for the last GEM [29], the charge signal collected at its bottom is given by 1 \u2212 \ud835\udf16ext, which is approximately 64 % of the multiplied charge for our configuration.\nIn order to reconstruct the event\u2019s position, we use Eq. 2.1 [18], where \ud835\udc44 is the charge\n\u2013 4 \u2013\ninformation collected from the bottom of the last GEM, and \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc65 and \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc66 are the lengths of the sensitive area for each direction. As indicated in Fig. 4, \ud835\udc4b1 and \ud835\udc4b2 are the signals collected at each end of the resistive chain in the X direction, while \ud835\udc4c1 and \ud835\udc4c2 are the equivalent signals in the Y direction.\n\ud835\udc4b\u2217 = \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc4b2 \u2212 \ud835\udc4b1\n\ud835\udc44 \ud835\udc4c\u2217 = \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc4c2 \u2212 \ud835\udc4c1 \ud835\udc44\n(2.1)\nAs mentioned before, the detector was tested at the IEA-R1 nuclear reactor using the same neutron beam of the AURORA diffractometer [30] (see Fig. 5). This monochromatic neutron beam is selected out of a collimated radial neutron beam from the core of the reactor, which operates at 4.5 MW. A multi-blade focusing silicon monochromator is used to select these neutrons with a fixed wavelength of 1.399 \u00c5 (41.80 meV) providing a (6.22 \u00b1 0.19) \u00d7 104 n cm\u22122s\u22121 flux (\ud835\udf19), measured by the Nuclear Metrology Laboratory at IPEN with the 197Au(\ud835\udc5b, \ud835\udefe)198Au reaction, using a 12 mm diameter thin gold foil, centered at the beam outlet (letter E of Fig. 5). The detector (letter A of Fig. 5) and the preamplifiers\u2019 box (letter C of Fig. 5) were mounted over an aluminum plate. This setup was fixed to a X-Y-Z precision table, that allowed the fine tuning of the detector\u2019s position with respect to the beam."

            "text": "To perform the spatial calibration of the detector, we used handmade cadmium masks which has a high neutron absorption cross section. Holes of different diameters were drilled in three masks.\n\u2013 5 \u2013\nThe positions and areas of the holes were measured using an image obtained with a table scanner. One of the produced masks in shown in Fig. 6, with its 15 holes, and its neutron image, obtained with the mask centered with respect to the detector\u2019s sensitive area.\nThe calibration is given by a linear dependency between the coordinates of certain holes in arbitrary units and their coordinates in known distances. The chosen holes are colinear in the X and Y directions, normally the ones in the central column for Y direction and the central row for X direction. We measured the detector spatial resolution by two methods: edge and point spread functions. The first one consists of using edges to fit step functions, as shown in Fig. 7.\nThe data was fitted with the complementary error function\nerfc(\ud835\udc5d) = 1 \u2212 2\u221a \ud835\udf0b \u222b \ud835\udc5d 0 \ud835\udc52\u2212\ud835\udc61 2 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61, (3.1)\nwhere \ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc65 \u2212 \ud835\udf07 \u221a\n2\ud835\udf0e . (3.2)\nThis function provides the same parameters of interest (\ud835\udf0e and \ud835\udf07) as the edge spread function (ESF). In this work, we define the position resolution as the FWHM of the Gaussian (or the 10-to-90 % distance of the ESF), i. e., 2.35\ud835\udf0e. We measured the position resolution with the edge spread function in different regions of the detector\u2019s sensitive area and along X and Y coordinates. The results are shown in Fig. 8. The second method relies on the fact that the FWHM of an ideally punctual hole converges to the spatial resolution of the detector, which is the width of the point spread function (PSF). The projection \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc60 obtained for a hole with a given diameter is the convolution of the PSF, for which it is safe to assume a 2D Gaussian function, with the projection of a circular area. This projection over the X direction can be written as\n\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc60(\ud835\udc65) = (\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc65 ~ \ud835\udc54)(\ud835\udc65) := \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e \ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udf0f)\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65 \u2212 \ud835\udf0f, \ud835\udf0e)\ud835\udc51\ud835\udf0f, (3.3)\nwhere \ud835\udc54 is the Gaussian function and \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc65 the projection of a circular area over the X direction. Fitting this convolution for holes of several diameters allows us to estimate the spatial resolution.\n\u2013 6 \u2013\n\u2013 7 \u2013\nThe convolution shown in Eq. 3.3 is computed numerically and the fit1 is done using the Least Square Method. The result is shown in Fig. 9.\nAlthough compatible with the 3 mm obtained with the ESF, the values obtained with this method are slightly better. This can be explained by the fact that the FWHM assigned to each diameter is the average of the FWHM for several runs using holes of that diameter.\nThe values obtained with the two different techniques result in a spatial resolution compatible with at least 3 mm. This spatial resolution is compatible with the obtained by similar detectors [21, 22] and is mostly limited by the fact that our detector uses only five electronic channels, which inherently only allows the estimation of the centroid of the track\u2019s charge distribution, which is at a certain distance from the neutron capture position. This distance is minimized when the maximum length of the track is truncated, such as in the case of 2 mm drift. It would be possible to strongly enhance the spatial resolution by operating the detector in the \ud835\udf07TPC mode (such as in [31]), however, it would be necessary to use a much more sophisticated acquisition system."

(3.4)\n1the fitted parameter is the resolution itself, since it is linearly dependent on \ud835\udf0e.\n\u2013 8 \u2013\nThe result of Eq. 3.4 is used to compute the macroscopic cross-section [33] for the converter layer:\n\u03a3 = \ud835\udc41\ud835\udf0e = (3.19 \u00b1 0.01) \u00d7 10\u22122 \ud835\udf07m\u22121. (3.5)\nThe neutron beam intensity after crossing our converter layer is\n\ud835\udc3cbeam = \ud835\udc52\u2212\u03a3\ud835\udc51 = (93.2 \u00b1 0.3)%. (3.6)\nTherefore, the capture efficiency is given by the percentage of absorbed neutrons:\n\ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50 = 1 \u2212 \ud835\udc52\u2212\u03a3\ud835\udc51 = (6.8 \u00b1 0.3)%. (3.7)\nWhen the neutron is captured too far from the lower side of the converter layer (at the boundary with the gaseous region), it might not be detected because the products of the capture reaction do not have enough energy to exit the layer, as pictured in Fig. 10 (case A). Therefore, such products have to fulfill a set of geometrical requisites that depend on the capture\u2019s position, which are shown in Fig. 10 (case B and C). Finally, the products that enter the drift region with too low energy are also not detected since there is an energy threshold to handle electrical noise and other acquisition system specifications.\nIn order to account for the constrains discussed above, the values for \ud835\udf0f\ud835\udefc and \ud835\udf0fLi, for both possible decay channels of Eq. 1.1, were evaluated from direct integration of the average dE/dx plot generated through SRIM [34]. It is also necessary to consider the energy threshold, which was done by finding \ud835\udf0f for which the average remaining energy for the given particle is equal to the threshold used in the experiment, of (100 \u00b1 10) keV. This process is shown in Fig. 11.\nThe considerations above are translated to the calculation for the detection efficiency \ud835\udf00\ud835\udc51 as follows:\n\u2013 9 \u2013\n\ud835\udf00\ud835\udc51 = \ud835\udc39\ud835\udf00\ud835\udc50 = \ud835\udc39(1 \u2212 \ud835\udc52\u2212\u03a3\ud835\udc51), (3.8)\nwhere \ud835\udc39 is the share of capture products emitted within the solid angle \u2126 of Fig. 10B, and is computed as\n\ud835\udc39 = \u2211\ufe01\nall products \ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc51, \ud835\udf0f\ud835\udc56) = \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udf0f\ud835\udc56=\ud835\udf0f\ud835\udefc1 ,\ud835\udf0f\ud835\udefc2 ,\ud835\udf0fLi1 ,\ud835\udf0fLi2 \u222b \ud835\udc51 0 \u222b cos\u22121(\ud835\udc65/\ud835\udf0f\ud835\udc56) 0 \ud835\udc51\u2126\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65 \u2248 0.477, (3.9)\nfor a boron carbide layer of thickness 2.2 \u00b5m, where \ud835\udf0f\ud835\udc56 are the path length for each product: \ud835\udf0f\ud835\udefc1 = 3.97 \u00b5m, \ud835\udf0f\ud835\udefc2 = 3.13 \u00b5m, \ud835\udf0fLi1 = 1.54 \u00b5m and \ud835\udf0fLi2 = 1.31 \u00b5m. As result, we obtain the neutron detection efficiency\n\ud835\udf00\ud835\udc51 = (3.22 \u00b1 0.14) %. (3.10)"

            "text": "Monte Carlo simulations play an important role in the development and optimization of this kind of detector. For this purpose, GEANT4 is a powerful tool to describe the detector and for the simulation of the interaction of particles with matter [35], allowing the simulation of the nuclear reaction, like Eq. 1.1, as well as the transport of the reaction products inside the detector. The detector was simulated with GEANT4 using the physics list QGSP_BERT_HP (which has high precision models for low energy neutrons [36]), according to the device described in section 2. The simulation consisted in a parallel uniform beam with 106 neutrons of 1.399 \u00c5 (41.80 meV), hitting the detector in a direction perpendicular to the converter layer. Taking 14 different thicknesses ranging from 0.25 \u00b5m to 5 \u00b5m of the boron carbide converter layer, we evaluate the thermal neutrons detection efficiency by counting the charged particles that leave the boron converter and reach the gaseous volume. For a nominal thickness of 2.2 \u00b5m, an efficiency of (3.14 \u00b1 0.10) % was obtained. While the maximum efficiency was achieved with a\n\u2013 10 \u2013\nthickness of 2.5 \u00b5m resulting in (3.17 \u00b1 0.10) %, as shown in Fig. 12. We did not considered the experimental threshold (100 keV) when evaluating the theoretical efficiency in this case.\nUsing the low-energy electromagnetic model Livermore [36], we simulated the deposited energy by the reaction products inside the 2 mm of the drift region. This simulation is used as an energy pre-calibration for the experimental spectrum since both present the same primary structure, consisting of an energy peak around 600 keV, as shown in Fig. 13. We did not include the experimental energy threshold (100 keV) of our system nor the charge multiplication process in the simulation, which means considering that the acquired energy is equal to the energy deposited by the reaction products in the absorption region of the detector.\n\u2013 11 \u2013"

We calculated the total number of neutrons from the neutron flux \ud835\udf19, measured as described in section 2, the area \ud835\udc34 selected from the beam and the time length \u2206\ud835\udc61 of the measurement. The neutron flux was corrected using the counts of a fission chamber installed at the neutron beam outlet using as reference the number of counts registered by this same chamber during the neutron flux calibration process. With these values, the experimental neutron detection efficiency is given by\n\ud835\udf00 = \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc61 =\n\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udf19\ud835\udc34\u2206\ud835\udc61 . (3.11)\nUsing cadmium masks with squared holes, we selected different areas from the beam: 0.36 cm2\nand 1.44 cm2, at the same position where the flux measurement was taken. The total number of detected neutrons \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc61 was counted with negligible uncertainties at these rates. We obtained (2.75 \u00b1 0.26) % detection efficiency for the 0.36 cm2 mask and (2.57 \u00b1 0.15) % for the 1.44 cm2, which are compatible within 1\ud835\udf0e with each other.\nThe gain stability was monitored in real-time, in order to provide necessary corrections to the image reconstruction in offline data analysis. A gain shift would imply changes in efficiency since the energy spectrum would be displaced from its original position with respect to the energy threshold. Besides that, changes in the gain over time may bring the detector to an unstable operation in terms of discharge probability.\nThe data shown in Fig. 14 present a method to analyze the gain stability: the energy channel of the run was divided into batches of 4 min each (separated by the dashed vertical lines) and plotted over time. Then, we locate the spectrum peak using a peak identification algorithm [37] and fit a Gaussian to it, registering its center as the cross marker in Fig. 14. Slow gain changes due to environmental changes are easily seen as a tendency in the sequence of the points, whose energy spectrum can be drifted by a reasonable amount as it happens in the case reported by [18]. The tendency analysis can be carried out by fitting the behaviour of the difference between each peak position and the average position of all peaks, which we labelled as \u2206peak in the Fig. 14.\nThere is a slight drift of the spectrum\u2019s peak within about 2.5 h, as the fit result of Fig. 14 suggests. However, this drift is smaller than 10 ADC channels, corresponding to about 0.2 % h\u22121 change, which is not statistically sufficient to be interpreted as a reasonable change. Also, at the beginning of the operation, some slow gain stabilization of these detectors are expected, as reported in other works [38\u201342]. The monitoring remains essential since it can be used to correct the detector\u2019s efficiency if significant changes happen, using the detector\u2019s current rate and the neutron monitor fission chamber.\n\u2013 12 \u2013"

            "text": "A neutron detector was built with a single boron carbide layer and a resistive charge division readout. This detector shows the feasibility of a position-sensitive detector that can be easily mounted in a neutron beam line based on simple standard electronics. The detector also operates above of the background gamma rays sensitive region (registering no events when the neutron beam is off), an essential feature for its use in environments like nuclear reactor research facilities. If needed, the gamma sensitivity can be controlled by changing the drift region, and a new energy pre-calibration can be quickly obtained with new simulation results. The average of the obtained thermal neutron detection efficiency is (2.66 \u00b1 0.15) %, which agrees within 2.7 \ud835\udf0e with the prediction of (3.22 \u00b1 0.14) % and with the preliminary simulation of (3.14 \u00b1 0.10) %, and can be reduced by altering the layer thickness allowing different applications, such as beam monitors. At the current configuration, one can use the detector to measure the beam profile given that the position resolution obtained was at least 3 mm. There is also the possibility to raise the efficiency by adding new converter layers over the GEMs, as seen in other works [19, 20, 43]. For future works and following that same idea, it is possible to use boron coated Thick-GEMs, operating with unitary effective gain, raising the thermal neutron detection efficiency."
