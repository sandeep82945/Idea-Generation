Quality of reporting and study design was assessed using the Consensus Health\nEconomic Criteria (CHEC). A narrative synthesis was conducted.\nResults: We identified 31 evaluations, including 11 conducted alongside a clinical\ntrial and 20 model-based evaluations. There was considerable heterogeneity in the\ndefinition of treatment-resistant depression, although with a trend for more recent\nstudies to use a definition of inadequate response to two or more antidepressive\ntreatments. A broad range of interventions were considered, including non-\npharmacological neuromodulation, pharmacological, psychological, and service-\nlevel interventions. Study quality as assessed by CHEC was generally high. Frequently\npoorly reported items related to discussion of ethical and distributional issues, and\nmodel validation. Most evaluations considered comparable core clinical outcomes \u2013\nencompassing remission, response, and relapse. There was good agreement on the\ndefinitions and thresholds for these outcomes, and a relatively small pool of outcome\nmeasures were used. Resource criteria used to inform the estimation of direct\ncosts, were reasonably uniform. Predominantly, however, there was a high level of\nheterogeneity in terms of evaluation design and sophistication, quality of evidence\nused (particularly health state utility data), time horizon, population considered, and\ncost perspective.\nConclusion: Economic evidence for interventions in TRD is underdeveloped,\nparticularly so for service-level interventions.

            "text": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) affects approximately 5% of the global population and continues to be a major contributor to the overall global burden of disease (1). There is strong evidence that the prevalence of MDD is increasing (2), with the COVID-19 pandemic driving prevalence rates yet higher. Response to the global health crisis and strategies used to prevent the spread of the virus, constructed an environment whereby factors contributing to MDD onset and reoccurrence were exacerbated; contributing to a 28% rise in global prevalence rates (3). Since many of these factors persist (including, but not restricted to: constrained healthcare resources; widened socioeconomic inequality; social isolation; neuropsychiatric sequelae), this trend is not expected to retreat in the near-term (4, 5).\nResponse to treatment of MDD varies, with many patients requiring more than one treatment step (6). A third of patients do not report improved symptoms despite multiple interventions, resulting in a persistent form of depression commonly described as \u201ctreatmentresistant depression\u201d (TRD) (7). Defining TRD is problematic, since failure to respond to treatment \u201cexists on a continuum\u201d (8). A recent review found that while the most widely used definition for TRD was a failure to respond to two or more treatments at an adequate dose and duration, only 19% of recent interventional TRD studies were consistent with that definition (9).\nReflecting this heterogeneity in classification of TRD (10), and indeed in the patient population (11), no single treatment pathway exists, although a stepped-care approach is recommended. Such a model aims to address scarce treatment resources by ensuring that the most effective, least restrictive treatments (in terms of both healthcare resources, and patient convenience), are delivered first, with patients \u201cstepped up\u201d to more intensive treatments as needed (12). Recent UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines (13) advocate starting treatment for moderate to severe MDD with psychological interventions, such as cognitive\u2013 behavioural therapy (CBT), combined with an antidepressant. Where symptoms persist after 4\u20136 weeks, additional treatments and referral to secondary/specialist mental health services should be considered. Further treatments may include increasing the antidepressant dose, switching to another antidepressant medication of the same or different class, switching to another psychological therapy, adding a second-generation antipsychotic or lithium, or augmenting with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), lamotrigine, or triiodothyronine. Other treatment options include repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and implanted vagus nerve stimulation.\nDespite this diverse armamentarium, there remains a high unmet need for new and cost-effective interventions (14, 15). Unfortunately,\nthe condition is highly recurrent\u201480% of TRD patients experience relapse within a year of remission and the probability of sustained remission over 10 years is just 40% (16). A well-established body of evidence has demonstrated that increasing treatment resistance is associated with poorer health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (8), increased direct medical costs (8, 17, 18), and indirect costs to society attributed to impairments in work productivity and activity (15, 19), and social care demands (20).\nAgainst a background of increasingly constrained healthcare budgets, it is important that decision makers consider not only clinical effectiveness, but the economic evidence for interventions, in order to identify and prioritize those that make the best use of available resources (21). Previous systematic reviews of economic evaluations of interventions for MDD have reported considerable uncertainty in their findings due to inconsistent methodological quality and results (22), and highlighted a lack of evidence and good quality data in TRD (23, 24). Johnston et al. (8) reviewed the literature on the economic burden of TRD, and found significant methodological and population disparities, highlighting heterogeneity in defining TRD, the outcomes measured, and the health state utility values reported.\nThe aim of this review is to appraise the existing evidence and methods used in economic evaluations of interventions for TRD, and to make best-practice recommendations to inform the development of future evaluations. Promoting consistency in evaluation methodology will improve confidence when making resource allocation decisions, and increase the likelihood that promising interventions receive appropriate funding or support."

Depending on the outcome measure used, economic evaluations may be classified as: cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA), when a clinical outcome measure is used; cost benefit analyses (CBA), when outcomes are valued in monetary terms; cost utility analysis (CUA), when health outcomes are valued as health state utilities to derive quality adjusted life years; cost consequence analysis (CCA), where multiple outcomes not easily summarized in a single summary measure are presented in a disaggregated format; and cost\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 02 frontiersin.org\nminimisation analysis (CMA), which assumes that the outcomes from the alternatives under consideration are equivalent (27)."

Some systems allow a negative utility value, whereby very poor health states may be valued as less preferable than death. When measured over time, utilities may be used to derive the quality adjusted life years (QALYs) associated with living in a particular health state (29)."

Where significant opportunity costs exist outside the healthcare system, for example in public health interventions, a broad perspective is advised, and there is growing support for such a broad perspective to be used in mental health economic evaluation (21). The 2016 Second Panel on Cost Effectiveness in Health and Medicine recommends analysts adopt a comprehensive approach, reporting separately both healthcare sector and societal perspectives (31). The Panel further recommends the societal perspective report costs and consequences in a comprehensive \u201cimpact inventory,\u201d and where possible, that non-health consequences are quantified and valued (31). While methodological guidance on choice of perspective varies by jurisdiction, it is generally agreed that the choice should be explicitly stated and determined by the study sponsor (and any stakeholders identified by the sponsor) (32)."

Ideally, the time horizon for economic evaluations should be sufficiently long to capture relevant differences in costs and outcomes between the comparators; for many interventions, this requires a lifetime horizon (33, 34). Where extrapolated data are used, this is likely to require the analyst to make assumptions about the continued efficacy of the interventions (35)."

            "text": "Within-trial evaluations have the advantage that the costs and consequences of the interventions under investigation are measured directly, but are constrained by the follow-up period, frequently precluding assessment of long-term cost effectiveness (36). Extrapolation may be possible using survival analysis models, though this approach requires related long-term data on costs, benefits and complications of the interventions (37).\nSample size and power estimates for trials are most commonly based on the primary clinical outcome. Owing to the tendency of cost variables to have much greater variance than clinical outcomes, trial-based economic evaluations are often underpowered to detect statistically significant differences in cost (38). Accordingly, health economic evaluations assess the probability of cost effectiveness against a certain threshold of willingness-to-pay (WTP), rather than employing statistical hypothesis tests concerning cost effectiveness (37). Typically, probability of cost-effectiveness is assessed against a range of WTP values, and is represented in a cost effectiveness acceptability curve, representing from the joint distribution of incremental costs and effects (37, 39). Most commonly, this distribution is estimated using non-parametric bootstrapping to address sampling uncertainty (39).\nBest practice guidelines encourage the use of robust methods to address missing data, since exclusion of cases with missing or censored data may introduce bias (33). While several approaches may be adopted for handling missing data, (including complete case analysis, single imputation and inverse probability weighting), the use of multiple imputation models are usually recommended (40), although this approach may be contested when evaluating data with a high degree of missingness (41).\nCombining methods for addressing sampling uncertainty and those for addressing missing data, however, is non-trivial and presents challenges both practical challenges (e.g., computational intensivity), and statistical challenges (e.g., the artificial reduction of sampling uncertainty through imputation) (33, 42). There is a need for further research in this area, as currently no consensus exists for best practice approaches (41)."

Economic models are mathematical abstractions of the real world: analysts will work with subject-matter experts to conceptualize a specific structure, the contingent assumptions, and required input parameters (43). The models describe the probability of specific outcomes following an intervention, with the costs and benefits of each outcome having an associated value. The expected value of that intervention is expressed as the sum of values for each outcome, weighted by the probability of the outcome (43).\nThree approaches are commonly used in decision analytic economic evaluation models. The decision tree is a simple but widely used approach used to evaluate short-term prognoses, represented by a series of pathways (44). Markov cohort models may be used to evaluate outcomes over a lifetime horizon, and typically model a homogeneous population transitioning through a series of \u201chealth\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 03 frontiersin.org\nstates.\u201d Transitions are modeled in a series of cycles (of a length defined by the analyst); a key property (and frequently a problematic assumption) of Markov models is that no \u201cmemory\u201d of the events of previous cycles is retained through each transition (45). Individuallevel microsimulation models, which may take the same form as a Markov model, facilitate modeling of a heterogeneous population, and the impact of past events (e.g., number of treatment failures, or adverse events), on prognosis (46).\nAnalogous to bootstrapping in within-trial evaluations, parametric methods (e.g., Monte Carlo simulation), are recommended to generate sampling distributions of joint mean cost and efficacy estimates (47)."

            "text": "The details of the 20 models appraised are given in Tables 3A, B. Six evaluations used a decision tree approach, the majority of which (n = 5) were evaluations of non-pharmacological neuromodulation interventions, while the sixth compared novel selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)/serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and generic SSRIs (61). In keeping with the associated restrictions of this analytical approach, all used a short time horizon, typically 6 months or less. The decision trees largely followed a similar structure, modeling three possible outcomes: remission, response (with no remission), and non-response. A representation of the generic decision tree structure is shown in Figure 2.\nThere were several notable variations from this structure. Both Kozel et al. (60) and Ghiasvand et al. (57) assumed that any response equated to full remission. This is a significant limitation as it does not allow for partial improvements in symptoms, and thereby is likely to overestimate the benefits of interventions.\nKozel\u2019s model also allowed for relapse. The model described by Malone et al. (61) compared the costs and consequences of various pharmaceutical treatment regimens, and augmented this generic structure with further steps that considered adverse events (AEs), and treatment changes. While four of the six evaluations described the conceptualization of the model structure, none described the rationale for selecting a decision tree approach, and only half described any structural assumptions or indicated that any validation assessment was undertaken.\nTwelve evaluations used Markov cohort models, and three extended this approach with more sophisticated Markov microsimulation models (all for neuromodulation interventions). A key characteristic of this extension is that it enables the tracking of individual patient characteristics or event history through the model. Most Markov models had a minimum horizon of 12 months, but only two had a lifetime horizon (53, 56). A similar \u201cbase\u201d generic\nstructure, shown in shown in Figure 3, was used across the majority of models, with three key \u201chealth states\u201d: remission, response, and relapse (and/or non-response).\nSeveral evaluations extend beyond this base structure, varying the levels of complexity and sophistication. Seven evaluations preceded the Markov model with a decision tree to represent a distinct acute phase of treatment. Other additional health states used (either as Markov health states or transition health states) included: death \u2013 particularly for models with a time horizon greater than 1 year (n = 7); treatment change (n = 7); severe depression (n = 6); discontinuation (n = 7); adverse events (n = 4); hospitalization (n = 2). Only one evaluation used an entirely different structure, modeling health states defined by four different levels of severity of depression (defined by MADRS score) (39).\nThe reporting of these models was generally good, with a majority describing a rationale for model structure (n = 9) and structural assumptions (n = 8). Nevertheless, some aspects of the health states included or omitted require some important limiting assumptions. Only seven models accounted for discontinuation of treatment, and none of those omitting discontinuation justified the omission. Discontinuation might feasibly be rolled into the \u201cnonresponse\u201d health state, however, this was not explicitly stated in any evaluation that omitted a \u201cdiscontinued\u201d health state; these may consequently overestimate treatment benefits by failing to account for discontinued patients. Of those evaluations that did include discontinuation, four either did not distinguish between discontinuation related to AEs or lack of efficacy, or assumed discontinuation due to AEs to be embedded in loss of treatment effect (53, 55, 67, 68). These four evaluations therefore considered AEs implicitly, but assumed no continued impact on quality of life beyond that of discontinuation due to lack of efficacy \u2013 an assumption that may not hold for severe or long-lasting AEs. AEs were considered explicitly in only five evaluations. Two considered both costs and utility decrements associated with AEs (52, 62), two considered only utility decrement (64), and one considered only costs (71). The majority did not model AEs and in most cases a rationale was not given, although it was suggested in two evaluations that the impact of AEs was expected to be limited, and similar between comparators (55, 59). While this assumption may be true of some comparators, it is an important structural assumption to validate, as omission will bias toward those interventions that have higher rates of AEs."

Notably, only two evaluations used values derived from patients with TRD (53, 70). Use of values derived from the broader MDD population was driven by the scarcity of health-related quality of life data specific to patients with TRD. Ideally, values used should be population specific (94, 95) \u2013 the extent to which MDD values generalize to TRD is unknown. All evaluations that modeled the disutility of adverse events (n = 3) drew these values from a study of AEs associated with SSRIs in MDD (96). As a consequence of the heterogeneity in sources used (and concomitantly, the heterogeneity of the populations from which the source data were drawn), there was also considerable variability in the values used for common health states: baseline depression, 0.25\u20130.55; remission, 0.76\u20130.91; response 0.71\u20130.76; no response 0.52\u20130.58; relapse 0.30\u20130.63.

            "text": "Table 4 summarizes evaluation results. Consistency of results varied across interventions. Four evaluations comparing neuromodulation (rTMS or ECT) to TAU consistently found the intervention to be cost-effective, and a dominant strategy (both more effective and less costly) in three evaluations. Direct comparisons of ECT and rTMS, however, were less consistent: six favored ECT and four favored rTMS. The source of these variations is not immediately clear; however, those that favored ECT tended to have a shorter (<12 month) time horizon, which may not have been long enough to capture benefits of maintenance treatment with rTMS. Those that adopted a societal perspective tended to favor rTMS, reflecting the higher indirect costs (care, time off work) of ECT. There is no clear indication that study or model design biased results in either direction. Notably, over half of these evaluations did not explicitly define the patient population in terms of severity or number of previously failed treatments. There was variation in the treatment protocol used for rTMS, which is likely to have a considerable impact on costs, as will the extent to which capital costs are attributed across different evaluations.\nOnly three pharmacotherapy evaluations considered the same comparators (esketamine vs TAU). Two CUAs found that despite improved outcomes esketamine was unlikely to be cost effective. The third evaluation, which was industry-sponsored, used a CEA approach, and found esketamine was likely to be cost efficient. In addition to differences in analytical approaches used, the two CUAs had much longer time horizons (5 years and lifetime), compared to the 12 month CEA. It is likely that the consideration of relapse over those longer horizons had a significant impact on cost-effectiveness.\nThe evaluations evaluating psychological interventions, which were all trial-based, were generally consistent in their findings: two CUAs comparing CBT to TAU and one comparing ISTDP to TAU found that these interventions were likely to be cost effective; two CUAs comparing RO-DBT found that the intervention was highly unlikely to be cost effective. The key driver of the cost inefficiency for RO-DBT were the costs of intensive treatment.\nWe reviewed two trial-based evaluations of service-level interventions which are not directly comparable. A US-based collaborative care program was found to be cost effective (80), while an evaluation of a specialist depression service in the UK found\nlimited additional benefits associated with the service and concluded it was unlikely to be cost-effective (77).\nAll except one evaluation explored uncertainty in parameters and/or results (72). Bootstrapping or similar methods were used to account for sampling uncertainty in almost all (n = 9) trialbased evaluations, while probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to account for the joint uncertainty of all key parameters in over half (n = 13) of the model-based evaluations. Although most (n = 16) model-based evaluations conducted some degree of one-way sensitivity analysis, fewer than half (n = 9) conducted a comprehensive sensitivity analysis, incorporating all important variables. Key drivers of uncertainty included the probability of response and remission, utility values used for acute/severe depression, and cost of intervention (particularly for rTMS where number of treatment courses varied)."

            "text": "The aim of this review was to appraise the literature systematically to describe the methods used in the economic evaluation of interventions for the management of TRD, to inform design and development of future evaluations in this field. We identified 31 evaluations, including 11 trial-based and 20 model-based evaluations. A broad range of interventions and designs were considered by the included evaluations, but almost half evaluated the cost effectiveness of neuromodulation interventions (rTMS and/or ECT), enhancing our ability to consider consistency of evaluation design, and the factors that most strongly influence results.\nThere was a distinct paucity of evidence relating to the economic evaluation of service-level interventions, with only two studies identified in the literature search. In their evaluation of a dedicated specialist depression service for TRD, Morris et al. (77) noted significant loss to follow-up during the trial and indicated the evaluation may have been underpowered to detect statistical improvements in symptoms at follow-up. It has been argued that the objective of economic evaluation is estimation of expected value of an intervention, and that decision making should therefore be based upon the weight of evidence, rather than the application of statistical inference rules (38, 97). Lack of statistical significance may, however, suggest that there is value in obtaining further evidence (97).\nDespite a growing interest in the application of digital technologies in the management and delivery of mental health care (98), no economic evaluations of such interventions were identified. Recent studies suggest the implementation of digital technologies (e.g., virtual reality, artificial intelligence) may improve diagnosis, intervention delivery, monitoring, access to care, and potentially reduce costs (98, 99). Economic evidence supporting digital technologies in healthcare generally is underdeveloped: there is a clear need for early-stage economic evaluations to support the development of these promising approaches (100).\nThe quality of reporting as assessed by the CHEC criteria was generally good, and some aspects were found to be relatively consistent across the evaluations. Most evaluations considered comparable clinical outcomes \u2013 encompassing remission, response/non-response to treatment, and relapse. There was good agreement on the definitions and associated threshold for these outcomes, and these were assessed by a relatively small pool of clinical outcome measures.

The impact of these inconsistencies is highlighted by the fact that despite the inclusion of 10 evaluations comparing rTMS and ECT, there is still inconclusive evidence as to the cost effectiveness of rTMS vs ECT.\nOur findings are in general agreement with the literature relating to economic evaluation of MDD, where reviews have found the evidence for multiple interventions to be inconclusive due to inconsistencies in evaluation design and methodological quality (21, 22), and that the paucity of evidence related to long-term outcomes in TRD restricts our ability to inform the long-term value of interventions in TRD (23, 24).

Only two evaluations used a lifetime horizon, extrapolating outcomes from clinical evaluations with follow-up periods of 12 months or less (53, 56). A key driver for the use of models in economic evaluation is to extrapolate the results of clinical trials to a longerterm horizon (47). In the context of TRD, a short time horizon may underestimate the cost effectiveness of an intervention by failing to account for smaller incremental improvements in mental health (accruing substantially with a longer horizon), or the improvements that persist beyond the evaluation horizon \u2013 for example, MDD patients receiving cognitive therapy have been found to exhibit reduced relapse rates for up to 6 years (78). Conversely, bearing in mind the highly recurrent nature of TRD over periods of up to 36 months (105, 106), cost effectiveness might be overestimated through censoring of relapse or recurrence events. Extrapolation implicitly introduces additional uncertainty into the model, but one must balance the impact of that additional uncertainty on results against the benefits of decision support that reflects the longer-term costs and consequences of the intervention in question."

Mental healthcare provision is underfunded globally (107), and budgets for provision of mental healthcare are typically not ringfenced, but must compete with other healthcare priorities. To justify support for novel interventions, commissioners must be able to appraise the value of those interventions within the context of these competing priorities \u2013 e.g., mental health vs cardiovascular disease."

            "text": "The most common economic outcome measure was the QALY, in most cases estimated using the EQ-5D-3L measure. Model-based evaluations predominantly used low-quality evidence to inform this parameter: sources were typically outdated, used unsophisticated\nvaluation methods, and were usually drawn from the broader MDD population, rather than TRD specific. There is good evidence that an increased number of treatment failures within an episode is associated with both increased depression severity and decreased HRQoL (8). This would indicate that HRQoL in TRD follows a somewhat distinct profile from the broader MDD population, and highlights the importance of using values specific to the population under study. Generic preference-based HRQoL measures are increasingly deployed in interventional evaluations (including eight described in this review): synthesis of contemporary data specific to the TRD population should therefore considered for future economic evaluations.\nGeneric measures are typically recommended over conditionspecific measures, since they facilitate comparable outcome collection across the healthcare spectrum, and (due to their brevity) are easy to collect (93). Despite their widespread use, however, there is a growing consensus amongst health economists working in mental health that generic measures such as the EQ-5D are not sufficiently sensitive to capture important changes in symptoms, functioning, or wellbeing in mental health conditions (108). While there is evidence that these issues may be valid in depression, concordance between generic HRQoL measures and clinical measures has been shown to reduce with severity (109). Partly in response to these concerns, there has been increased focus on measurement of wellbeing and quality of life in mental health (110), but to date, there exists no mental health domain-specific preference-based measure that has been sufficiently validated that it can be recommended as an alternative to the EQ5D or the SF-6D. In the absence of such a measure, the quality of the evidence used to inform EQ-5D generated utility data is of particular importance, and extensive sensitivity testing of utility values is imperative. It should be noted that increasingly, the updated EQ-5D-5L (rather than the -3L) measure is used in interventional studies, owing to is superior psychometric properties (111). The value of supplementing a CUA with a secondary CEA or CCA analysis (for example incorporating mental-health specific outcomes, or patient preferences), in order to increase confidence in results, may additionally be considered.\nWhere a CEA approach was adopted, various outcomes were used (cost per remitter, cost per depression-free day, cost per relapse prevented, or simply incremental change in outcome). Cost per remission is arguably a more intuitive measure to present to decision makers, and conversion of the cost per unit change to this measure should be relatively straightforward, providing adequate availability of information."

            "text": "Recent years have seen increasing interest in the adoption of a \u201cvalues-based\u201d framework for delivery of mental health care, explicitly incorporating the preferences, priorities, and values of mental health service users (112, 113). The incorporation of patient preferences in decisions related to resource allocation is justifiable on grounds of both ethics (since patients have agency in the decisions that affect their health), and on improving outcomes (patients are more likely to engage with interventions that match their preferences) (114). Despite this, none of the evaluations described incorporated patient values, preferences, or priorities in the presentation of their analysis. The HTA report by Atlas et al. (53) incorporated feedback from patient advocates, importantly highlighting concerns that the\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 15 frontiersin.org\nclinical outcome measures typically used do not reflect the full burden of TRD, and calling for the incorporation of measures of impact on work, productivity, disability, and family or caregiver wellbeing. Elsewhere, patients have argued that remission is more accurately described by the presence of positive mental health features (optimism, vigor, and self-confidence) than the absence of symptoms (115). Although currently not a pre-requisite for HTA submissions, or best practice guidance, the growing recognition of the importance of the perspective of the patient in resource allocation decisions warrants serious consideration of how this might be incorporated explicitly in future economic evaluations. Longerterm objectives might consider the co-development of outcome measures that better reflect patient priorities; more immediately, methods such as discrete-choice experiments may be used to directly elicit and value both health and non-health impacts of interventions, facilitating direct incorporation of patient preferences in economic evaluations (116)."

Focusing instead on broader resource item considerations, we found a reasonable level of consistency for direct costs across the evaluations. A third of the evaluations reviewed included indirect non-healthcare costs, although with considerable variation in the items included. In many cases this simply including productivity gains or losses which, when measured over relatively short time horizons, had a relatively small impact on results compared to the healthcare perspective. A minority considered a more comprehensive set of indirect costs. Variability in indirect costs that contribute to the broader \u201csocietal\u201d perspectives is in part a reflection of the different contexts in which these evaluations were conducted: out-of-pocket costs, reliance on informal care, or transport costs may vary significantly between jurisdictions and in some cases may be so negligible that they are not considered for inclusion.\nGood practice guidance relating to selection of costs for inclusion in economic evaluations recommends that either all relevant costs should be included, or (for more pragmatic studies) those costs that are most likely to meaningfully differ between comparators and thereby impact the result of the evaluation (47)."

            "text": "The choice of cost perspective should be informed by the intended audience of the economic evaluation (47). Most commonly, the audience for economic evaluations is the payer; in the UK, NICE (whose remit is to determine if interventions should be funded by the NHS), requires that the perspective for economic evaluations should be that of the health service (104). Effective management of depression though, has been shown to have significantly greater impacts on productivity costs alone than on health care costs (21). When considering the global costs to society of poor mental\nhealth, choosing a narrow perspective that disregards those costs (or benefits) may be problematic, or even misleading.\nSince mental health care is typically funded through public health care budgets, a health system perspective will be a pre-requisite for most decision makers, but we would reiterate the call from Knapp and Wong (21) that by providing a societal perspective in parallel, the broader societal impacts can also be taken into account. This broader perspective, however, is somewhat juxtaposed with our earlier recommendation that the primary analysis should use a CUA design. An immediate approach therefore might consider a secondary CCA analysis, adopting a societal perspective and reporting the non-health costs and benefits of alternatives."

The key health states described in most of the evaluations were consistent with established treatment goals of trials in MDD/TRD, including response, remission, and relapse (117). Sensitivity analyses of model-based evaluations frequently showed that it was these outcome parameters that were most likely to affect the results of the evaluations. Beyond these key endpoints, there was considerable variation in the structural complexity of modelbased evaluations. Adverse events were rarely considered explicitly, although a minority of evaluations indicated that they had been considered and dismissed as having a negligible impact. Similarly, discontinuation was rarely considered, and where it was the reasons for discontinuation were poorly described.\nGood practice guidance recommends an explicit process of conceptual modeling prior to implementation, to arrive at an appropriate scope for perspective, time horizon, choice of model type and structure, and which outcomes and costs to consider (118). The requirement to explicitly detail model conceptualization in reports has recently been added to the NICE HTA manual section 4.6.3 (104)."

Our aim was to develop a resource to inform the design of future economic evaluations in TRD agnostic of intervention, setting, or perspective. The review consequently incorporated all intervention types and all study design types; however, this introduces heterogeneity into the review, and limits the detail with which differences between evaluations may be explored. In keeping with the broad-brush approach, evaluation appraisal and recommendations are necessarily made at a generic level, and are not specific to context. Comparative evaluation of the results of included studies was conducted at a superficial level to illustrate how different evaluation design considerations may influence study conclusions. Where comparison of results is undertaken to inform resource allocation\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 16 frontiersin.org\ndecisions, it is critical that context is accounted for. Key factors that should be considered in further detail in such comparisons include severity; number of previously failed treatments; treatment setting; and jurisdictional variations in resource costs and costeffectiveness thresholds."

            "text": "Consistent with reviews of economic evaluations in MDD (23), our review found that the economic evidence for interventions in TRD is underdeveloped, particularly so for service-level interventions. Where evidence does exist, it is hampered by inconsistency in study design, methodological quality, and availability of high quality long-term outcomes evidence. Consequently there is limited data available to reassure policy makers involved in commissioning interventions and services in TRD of their cost effectiveness.\nTo strengthen the evidence base, this review identifies a number of key considerations and challenges for the design of future economic evaluations. While some considerations may be addressed immediately (e.g., appropriately defining the evaluation population, and selection of appropriate time-horizon and perspective), we also identify longer term challenges related to methodology development and building consensus in the research community to promote consistency in study design. The lack of long-term outcomes data limits the value of current economic evaluations. In particular we identified a need for more robust health-state utility data specific to TRD; consensus for a core outcome set that incorporates the measures from which these are derived would be a significant step forward.\nReflecting the growing recognition of the importance of incorporating the values of the patient in resource allocation decisions, we also suggest there is a need to develop methods to incorporate those values in economic evaluation frameworks systematically.\nData availability statement\nThe original contributions presented in this study are included in this article/Supplementary material; further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author.\nAuthor contributions\nLJ and CW designed the research programme this review belongs to.
