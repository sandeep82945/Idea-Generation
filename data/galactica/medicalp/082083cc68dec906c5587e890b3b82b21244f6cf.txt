Psoriasis is a skin disease with occasional involvement of non-cutaneous territories. Beyond the usual, cardiovascular events are more frequent in these patients and correlate only partially with disease activity, suggesting the presence of other unknown factors. We selected ten psoriatic patients without treatment in the last year and matched them for age and gender with eleven healthy subjects. Ficoll-extracted mononuclear cells were analyzed with flow cytometry for monocyte surface phenotype markers, intracellular NFκB/inflammasome-dependent interleukins, and chemotaxis receptor CXCR3. Using ELISA, patient serum was evaluated for ADAMTS7 and CXCL10. Inflammatory M1 monocytes showed higher levels of IL-1β and IL-6 in psoriatic patients. M2 monocytes also showed higher levels of intracellular inflammatory cytokines. Nevertheless, IL-6 values were higher compared to other monocytes and IL-1β. The mTORC activation markers ADAMTS7 and S6Rp were higher in psoriatic patients than in healthy controls. In psoriatic patients, serum levels of ADAMTS7 were elevated, and M2 monocytes showed a distinct inflammatory response with higher relative levels of NFκB-dependent IL-6 and less activity of the CXCR3–CXCL10 chemotactic pathway. These data suggest pathways with potential markers for prediction and early detection of cardiovascular risk in psoriatic patients. 1. conclusions We analyzed a distinct group of patients who did not have the confounding effect of methotrexate, NSAIDs, or biological therapies, which allowed us to remove an important variable in the analysis. Despite this, the monocyte’s phenotype showed complex behavior with different features between each subset. Non-inflammatory cells showed distinct interleukin marks, which can influence their participation in atheromatosis.
