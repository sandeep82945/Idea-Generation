    "abstractText": "The genus Talaromyces belongs to the phylum Ascomycota of the kingdom Fungi. Studies have shown that Talaromyces species yield many kinds of secondary metabolites, including esters, terpenes, steroids, alkaloids, polyketides, and anthraquinones, some of which have biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, bacteriostatic, and antitumor activities. The chemical constituents of fungi belonging to the genus Talaromyces that have been studied by researchers over the past several years, as well as their biological activities, are reviewed here to provide a reference for the development of high-value natural products and innovative uses of these resources.",

Natural resources offer the potential to find new structural classes with unique bioactivities for disease treatment. Endophytic fungi represent a rich source of bioactive metabolites (Uzma et\u00a0al., 2018). The genus Talaromyces is widely distributed in soil, plants, sponges, and foods. Recent findings have demonstrated that Talaromyces are very abundant in marine environments (Nicoletti and Vinale, 2018). This may be\u00a0due to the fact that the ocean itself is rich in species resources. Moreover, the extreme living conditions of the oceans have led marine microorganisms to develop more specific metabolic patterns and Talaromyces can produce a number of structurally diverse active substances. Their metabolites have a wide range of biological activities, such as anti-inflammatory meroterpenoids, thioestercontaining benzoate derivatives that exhibit significant \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activity and oxaphenalenone dimers with broad antibacterial activity. In this paper, we\u00a0 will summarize and describe the research on the secondary metabolites of Talaromyces species\nTYPE Review PUBLISHED 19 August 2022 DOI 10.3389/fmicb.2022.984801"

The current problems in the isolation and analysis of fungal secondary metabolites are summarized and the prospects of their utilization are provided.\nResearch status of Talaromyces species\nTalaromyces belongs to the fungal phylum, ascomycete subphylum, ascomycetes, sporangia, and fungal family, which are widely distributed in sponges, plants, and soil. The colonies started out yellow and slowly turned gray-green over the course of a week. The middle of the back is yellow, and the edges are white (Figure\u00a01). Talaromyces has various species (Figure\u00a02). T. marneffei, T. funiculosum, and T. purpureogenus are the most studied strains at present. In addition, new strains, such as T. rubrifaciens, T. australis, T. kendrickii, T. veerkampii, T. fuscoviridis, and T. stellenboschiensi were isolated and purified (Visagie et\u00a0al., 2015; Luo et\u00a0al., 2016), and the corresponding chemical constituents were studied, which greatly enriched the species of chemical constituents of the fungi. The secondary metabolites of\nTalaromyces are rich in species, have novel structures and have good biological activity, which provides a basis for the development and application of endophytes. At present, the compounds isolated from the secondary metabolites of Talaromyces include esters, terpenoids and steroids, alkaloids, polyketones, anthraquinones and others, and most of them have good biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and antitumor activities.\nRelated studies have shown that Talaromyces species have great potential in agriculture, food, cosmetics, medicine, and environmental protection. In the field of agriculture, Talaromyces species can inhibit pathological changes in crops and promote crop growth. T. tratensis can be\u00a0used as a biological control agent to control brown spot and dirty panicle diseases in rice (Dethoup et\u00a0al., 2018). The secondary metabolites in T. tratensis, such as glucanase, can effectively treat rot disease that affects the yield of cucumbers and tomatoes (Halo et\u00a0al., 2019). T. flavus not only promotes the growth of cotton and potatoes (Naraghi et\u00a0al., 2012) but also produces an enzyme that plays an important role in resisting plant diseases for their strong capacity of degrading chitin (Xian et\u00a0al., 2011). Most Talaromyces species can produce a red pigment (Frisvad et\u00a0al., 2013; Venkatachalam et\u00a0al., 2018), which can be\u00a0used as a natural colorant in cosmetics and foods. The thermostable enzyme produced in T. emersonii can effectively improve bread quality with respect to hardness, staling, and loaf\nA\nD E\nB C\nFIGURE\u00a01 Talaromyces amestolkiae (CBS 365.48) in vitro.

An aspartic protease from T. leycettanus has strong proteolytic activity and improves the clarity of fruit juice (Guo et\u00a0al., 2019). Talaromyces species can produce many other bioactive secondary metabolites, and these compounds have been found to have antibacterial, antiinflammatory, antitumor, antioxidant, nematocidal, and other effects in medical research. Secondary metabolites from an Australian Marine Tunicate-Associated Fungus Talaromyces sp. (CMB-TU011) exhibit certain antibacterial activities (Dewapriya et\u00a0al., 2018). GH3 \u03b2-glucosidases from T. amestolkiae expressed in Pichia pastoris can transglycosylate phenolic molecules, and the resulting transglycosylation products can improve the biological activity of the original aglycones against breast cancer cells (M\u00e9ndez-L\u00edter et al., 2019). Talaraculones from a strain of T. aculeatus can inhibit the activity of \u03b1-glucosidase and can be\u00a0used to prevent the progression of type II diabetes, as well as for the early treatment of type II diabetes (Ren et\u00a0al., 2017). In the field of environmental protection, biosorption by microorganisms has been proven to be\u00a0an effective technique for removing heavy metals from wastewater. A biological adsorbent formed by combining T. amestolkiae with a specific chitosan sponge can\neffectively remove trace heavy metals or high concentrations of lead from industrial wastewater (Wang et\u00a0al., 2019). Talaromyces sp. KM-31 can remove arsenic from heavily polluted wastewater and can thus be\u00a0 employed in bioremediation strategies (Nam et\u00a0al., 2019).\nAccording to the classification of the chemical components, this paper will summarize and explain research carried out on secondary metabolites from Talaromyces species and their biological activities over the past 10 years with the aim of providing references for follow-up studies of Talaromyces, at the same time, the problems existing in the separation and analysis of fungal secondary metabolites and the prospect of Talaromyces species, as well as summarizing existing problems in the separation and analysis of fungal secondary metabolites and prospects for the use of secondary metabolites from Talaromyces species.\nStudies on the chemical constituents and activity of"

Dinapinones AB1 and AB2 (1 and 2), dinapinones AC1 and AC2 (3 and 4), dinapinones AD1 and AD2 (5 and 6), and dinapinones AE1 and AE2 (7 and 8; Figure\u00a03), which were isolated from the fermentation broth of T. pinophilus FKI-3864\u00a0in 2013 (Kawaguchi et\u00a0al., 2013), were identified and characterized as ester derivatives. These dinaphthoquinones have the same backbone of aryl dihydronaphthoquinone and consist of one monapinone A and one different monapinone in a heterodimer. Compound 2 had a strong inhibitory effect on triacylglycerol synthesis in intact mammalian cells, with an IC50 value of 1.17 \u03bcM.\nSeventeen new polyesters were isolated from the fermentation products of the wetland soil-derived fungus T. flavus, namely, talapolyesters A\u2013F (9\u201312, 22 and 24), 15G256\u03bd (13), 15G256\u03bd-me (14), 15G256\u03c0 (15), 15G256\u03b2-2 (16), 15G256\u03b1-2 (17), 15G256\u03b12-me (18), 15G256\u03b9 (19), 15G256\u03b2 (20), 15G256\u03b1 (21), 15G256\u03b1-1 (23) (Figure\u00a04), and 15G256\u03c9 (25) (He et\u00a0al., 2014b). All macrocyclic polyesters (19\u201325) were cytotoxic to HL-60, SMMC-7721, A-549, MCF-7, and SW480 tumor cells, while linear polyesters (9\u201318) were inactive with IC50\u00a0> 40 mM compared to cisplatin. This suggests that a macrocyclic structure is required for cytotoxicity. Among them, 20 and 25 showed significant cytotoxic activity against MCF-7 cell lines with IC50 of 3.27 and 4.32 \u03bcM, respectively. The cytotoxic activity of 15G256 polyester was systematically investigated for the first time and a tight conformational relationship is presented.\nTalaromycolides A\u2013C (26\u201328), rubralide C (29), sclerotinin A (30), alternariol (31), and penicillide (32) were obtained from the\nFIGURE\u00a02 Neighbor-joining tree of T. amestolkiae (CBS 365.48) based on ITS rDNA.\nFrontiers in Microbiology 04 frontiersin.org\nepiphytic fungal strain T. pinophilus AF-02, which was isolated from green Chinese onion, in 2015 (Zhai et\u00a0al., 2015). Compound 26 [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) = 12.5 \u03bcg/ml] showed stronger inhibitory activity against Clostridium perfringens than erythromycin, streptomycin, acheomycin, and ampicillin. Compound 26 (MIC = 6.25 \u03bcg/ml) showed similar inhibitory activity to acheomycin and was superior to levofloxacin, ampicillin, and streptomycin against Bacillus subtilis. Compound 27 (MIC = 12.5 \u03bcg/ml) showed higher inhibitory activity than erythromycin and ampicillin against Bacillus megaterium and higher inhibitory activity than erythromycin, ampicillin, and streptomycin against Escherichia coli (MIC = 25 \u03bcg/ml). Compound 28 (MIC = 25 \u03bcg/ml) was more active against C. perfringens than erythromycin, streptomycin, acheomycin and ampicillin.\nIn 2015, the structures of compounds 33 and 34 were characterized as deacetylisowortmins A and B, which were isolated from T. wortmannii LGT-4 derived from the leaves of a mangrove plant Acanthus ilicifolius (Fu et\u00a0al., 2016). Four esters, talaromyones A and B (35 and 36), penicillide (32), and purpactin A (37), were obtained from a fermentation product of the mangrove endophytic fungus T. stipitatus SK-4\u00a0in 2016 (Cai et\u00a0al., 2017). Compound 36 exhibited antibacterial activity against\nB. subtilis with an MIC value of 12.5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml. In the \u03b1-glucosidase inhibition assay, compounds 36 and 37 showed some inhibitory activity with an IC50 values of 48.4\u201399.8\u00a0\u03bcM.\nFive butenolides (38\u201342), seven (3S)-resorcylide derivatives (43\u201349) (Figure\u00a05), two butenolide-resorcylide dimers (50 and 51) were yielded by culture on a solid rice medium of T. rugulosus isolated from the Mediterranean sponge Axinella cannabina (K\u00fcppers et\u00a0 al., 2017). The butenolide\u2013resorcylide dimers talarodilactones A and B (50 and 51) was highly cytotoxic to the L5178Y mouse lymphoma cell line with IC50 of 3.9\u00a0 \u03bcM and 1.3\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively.\nTalaromycin A (52) and clearanol A (53) were isolated from the endophytic fungus Talaromyces sp. MH551540 associated with Xanthoparmelia angustiphylla in 2018 (Yuan et\u00a0 al., 2018). Compound 52 and 53 had selective cytotoxicity against MDA-MB-231 cells. Compound 54, which was identified as wortmannine F, was obtained from cultures of the endophytic fungus T. wortmannii LGT-4 isolated from Tripterygium wilfordii and has a strong phosphoinositide-3-kinase-\u03b1 (PI3K-\u03b1) inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 25 \u03bcM (Zhao et\u00a0 al., 2019b). Pentalsamonin (55) was isolated from submerged fermentation on Bengal gram husk (BegH) of T. purpureogenus CFRM-02 (Pandit et\u00a0al., 2018).

Two previously undescribed phthalides, amestolkins A (58) and B (59) were isolated from T. amestolkiae derived from Syngnathus acus Linnaeus in Lingshui Li Autonomous County, Hainan Province, China, which has the same planar structure of (1,5-dihydroxyhexyl)-7hydroxyisobenzofuran-1(3H)-one. They were shown to inhibit gene expressions of proinflammatory factors including C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL-2), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) as well as reducing the secretion of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in BV2 microglia at the concentration of 30 \u03bcM (Huang et\u00a0al., 2022)."

They are synthesized by a series of decarboxylative condensation reactions between small carboxylic acids and malonate using polyketide synthases (PKSs; Richardson and Khosla, 1999). Two polyketones, mitorubrin (90) and monascorubrin (91) (Figure\u00a0 6), were isolated from T. atroroseus (Frisvad et\u00a0 al., 2013). Because no citrinin was found in any Talaromyces species, it may be\u00a0a good alternative for red pigment production. Compound 92, which was characterized as a polyketone and named talaroxanthone, was obtained from the fermentation products of an endophytic strain of a Talaromyces sp. isolated from the Amazonian rainforest plant Duguetia stelechantha root (Koolen et\u00a0 al., 2013). Five compounds, 9a-epi-bacillisporin E (93), 1-epi-bacillisporin F (94), and bacillisporins F-H (95\u201397) were isolated from the fermentation products of the soil fungus T. stipitatus (Zang et\u00a0al., 2016). Compound 97 exhibited some antibacterial activity and some cytotoxicity against HeLa cells. Compounds 98\u2013100, wortmannilactones I1-I3, which were identified and characterized as three new polyketides, were purified from T. wortmannii using the one strain\u2013many compounds strategy. These compounds showed selective inhibitory activity against NADH fumarate reductase (Liu et\u00a0al., 2016).\nThe polyketone 3-O-methylfunicone (101) was isolated from the culture filtrate of an endophytic strain of T. pinophilus obtained from the strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo) in 2017 (Vinale et\u00a0al., 2017). On water agar at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ ml, it completely inhibited the growth of phytopathogenic fungi such as Rhizoctonia solani (De Stefano et\u00a0 al., 1999). Eleven polyketones, talaraculones A\u2013F (102\u2013107), pinazaphilone B (108), pinophilin B (109), Sch 725680 (110), (\u2212)-mitorubrin (111), and (\u2212)-mitorubrinol (112), were obtained from the fungus T. aculeatus, which was isolated from saline-alkali soil (Ren et\u00a0al., 2017). The results of the activity tests showed that compounds 102 and 103 exhibited very high levels of inhibitory activity against \u03b1-glucosidase than the positive control acarbose (IC50 = 101.5\u00a0 \u03bcM), with IC50 values of 78.6 and 22.9\u00a0 \u03bcM, respectively.

The anthraquinone monomer (126) showed higher bioactivity than the dimer dianthraquinone (125). A new anthraquinones biemodin (127) and five known anthraquinones emodic acid (128), skyrin (125), oxyskyrin (129), and rugulosins A and B (130 and 131) were isolated from cultures of the endophytic fungus T. wortmannii obtained from healthy inner tissues of Aloe vera (Bara et\u00a0 al., 2013a). In the same year, two anthraquinone compounds, talaromannins A and B (132 and 133), were obtained from T. wortmannii in A. vera (Bara et\u00a0al., 2013b). Both compounds displayed moderate MICs in a comparable concentration range for S. aureus and 132 represented the most active congeners.\nFive anthraquinones were isolated from the solid fermentation products of the endophytic fungus Talaromyces sp.

Activity tests showed that compounds 134, 125, and 129 displayed moderate cytotoxic activity against the MCF-7 cell line. Six anthraquinone compounds, 2,2\u2032-bis-(7-methyl-1,4,5-trihydroxyanthracene-9,10-dione) (136), emodin (126), questinol (137), citreorosein (138), fallacinol (139), and rheoemodin (140), were obtained from an ethyl acetate extract of a culture of the fungus T. stipitatus KUFA 0207, which is derived with a marine sponge (Noinart et\u00a0al., 2017). Emodin (126), questinol (137), citreorosein (138), fallacinol (139), and rheoemodin (140) were tested for their\nanti-obesity activity using the zebrafish Nile red assay. The results showed that only the anthraquinones questinol (137) and citreorosein (138) had significant anti-obesity activity. Questinol (137) and citreorosein (138) reduced >60% and > 90% of the stained lipids with the IC50 values of 0.95 and 0.17 \u03bcM, respectively. The positive control resveratrol (REV) had an IC50 value of 0.6 \u03bcM. Emodin (140) caused toxicity (death) for all exposed zebrafish larvae after 24 h, while fallacinol (139) and rheoemodin (140) did not have any significant effects. It is interesting to observe that questinol (137), citreorosein (138) and fallacinol (139) are structurally similar, all having a hydroxymethyl group on C-6 and a hydroxyl group on C-8. Replacing the hydroxyl group on C-1 by a methoxyl group, as in questinol (137), diminishes the activity whereas replacing the hydroxyl group on C-3 with a methoxyl group, as in fallacinol (139), completely removes the anti-obesity activity. Therefore, it seems that the hydroxymethyl group on C-6 and the hydroxyl groups on C-3 and C-8 are necessary for the antiobesity activity of the polyhydroxy anthraquinones."

            "text": "Talaromyces fungi include some of the most important species of microorganisms. The secondary metabolites from Talaromyces species that have unique structures and useful activities are of great value in research and development. However, there are still some problems to be\u00a0 solved in the study of fungal secondary metabolites. Firstly, owing to the limitations of strain isolation techniques and fungal culture conditions, some fungi cannot be\u00a0isolated or do not grow well. Now often use fungal culture mediums are: PDA medium, PDB medium, BegH medium, rice solid medium and so on. Among them, rice medium is the most used (Table\u00a01), which may be\u00a0 due to more fungal metabolites cultured in solid\nmedium than liquid medium. It also reflected the problems of single nutrition and limited culture in the application of fungus synthesis medium. It is hoped that unconventional media can be\u00a0used and new media can be\u00a0developed. Secondly, it had been reported in available reports that the addition of epigenetic modifications to the culture medium can stimulate the expression of silenced genes thereby enabling the production of novel secondary metabolites. However, none of the literature in the study of secondary metabolites of the Talaromyces has investigated the effect of epigenetic modifiers. Therefore, epigenetic modifiers can be\u00a0added to stimulate the expression of their silent genes. Finally, many existing studies have been done on the ethyl acetate part of the ferment, which is moderately polar and easy to separate. The aqueous part, on the other hand, has been ignored or even discarded due to its high polarity and difficulty of separation. Therefore, it is hoped that methods for the separation of compounds with high polarity will be\u00a0developed as well as the development of related fillers. In a word, we\u00a0should make full use of modern scientific and technological methods to carry out an in-depth study of the secondary metabolites produced by Talaromyces fungi and identify new active components to provide lead compounds for the research and development of innovative drugs.\nFIGURE\u00a015 Chemical structures of compounds 227\u2013238.\nFrontiers in Microbiology 16 frontiersin.org\nTABLE\u00a01 Name of Talaromyces\u2019 secondary metabolites, source strains, activity and their culture media.\nCategory Compound name Fungus Pharmacological activity or application\nMedium References\nEsters Dinapinones AB1 (1) T. pinophilus FKI-3864 / Miura\u2019s medium Kawaguchi et\u00a0al., 2013\nDinapinones AB2 (2) T. pinophilus FKI-3864 Inhabit triacylglycerol\nsynthesis in intact\nmammalian cells, with an\nIC50 value of 1.17\u00a0\u03bcM\nMiura\u2019s medium Kawaguchi et\u00a0al., 2013\nDinapinones AC1 (3) T. pinophilus FKI-3864 / Miura\u2019s medium Kawaguchi et\u00a0al., 2013\nDinapinones AC2 (4) T. pinophilus FKI-3864 / Miura\u2019s medium Kawaguchi et\u00a0al., 2013\nDinapinones AD1 (5) T. pinophilus FKI-3864 / Miura\u2019s medium Kawaguchi et\u00a0al., 2013\nDinapinones AD2 (6) T. pinophilus FKI-3864 / Miura\u2019s medium Kawaguchi et\u00a0al., 2013\nDinapinones AE1 (7) T. pinophilus FKI-3864 / Miura\u2019s medium Kawaguchi et\u00a0al., 2013\nDinapinones AE2 (8) T. pinophilus FKI-3864 / Miura\u2019s medium Kawaguchi et\u00a0al., 2013\nTalapolyesters A (9) T. flavus / potato dextrose agar (PDA);\npotato dextrose broth (PDB); rice\nsolid medium\nHe et\u00a0al., 2014b\nTalapolyesters B (10) T. flavus / PDA; PDB; rice solid\nmedium\nHe et\u00a0al., 2014b\nTalapolyesters C (11) T. flavus / PDA; PDB; rice solid\nmedium\nHe et\u00a0al., 2014b\nTalapolyesters D (12) T. flavus / PDA; PDB; rice solid\nmedium\nHe et\u00a0al., 2014b\n15G256\u03bd (13) T. flavus / PDA; PDB; rice solid\nmedium\nHe et\u00a0al., 2014b\n15G256\u03bd-me (14) T. flavus / PDA; PDB; rice solid medium He et\u00a0al., 2014b\n15G256\u03c0 (15) T. flavus / PDA; PDB; rice solid medium He et\u00a0al., 2014b\n15G256\u03b2-2 (16) T. flavus / PDA; PDB; rice solid medium He et\u00a0al., 2014b\n15G256\u03b1-2 (17) T. flavus / PDA; PDB; rice solid medium He et\u00a0al., 2014b\n15G256\u03b1-2-me (18) T. flavus / PDA; PDB; rice solid medium He et\u00a0al., 2014b\n15G256\u03b9 (19) T. flavus Antitumor PDA; PDB; rice solid medium He et\u00a0al., 2014b\n15G256\u03b2 (20) T. flavus Antitumor PDA; PDB; rice solid medium He et\u00a0al., 2014b\n15G256\u03b1 (21) T. flavus Antitumor PDA; PDB; rice solid medium He et\u00a0al., 2014b\nTalapolyesters E (22) T. flavus Antitumor PDA; PDB; rice solid medium He et\u00a0al., 2014b\n15G256\u03b1-1 (23) T. flavus Antitumor PDA; PDB; rice solid medium He et\u00a0al., 2014b\nTalapolyesters E (24) T. flavus Antitumor PDA; PDB; rice solid medium He et\u00a0al., 2014b\n15G256\u03c9 (25) T. flavus Antitumor PDA; PDB; rice solid medium He et\u00a0al., 2014b\nTalaromycolides A (26) T. pinophilus AF-02 Antibacterial YES liquid medium Zhai et\u00a0al., 2015\nTalaromycolides B (27) T. pinophilus AF-02 Antibacterial YES liquid medium Zhai et\u00a0al., 2015\nTalaromycolides C (28) T. pinophilus AF-02 Antibacterial YES liquid medium Zhai et\u00a0al., 2015\nRubralide C (29) T. pinophilus AF-02 / YES liquid medium Zhai et\u00a0al., 2015\nSclerotinin A (30) T. pinophilus AF-02 / YES liquid medium Zhai et\u00a0al., 2015\nAlternariol (31) T. pinophilus AF-02 / YES liquid medium Zhai et\u00a0al., 2015\nPenicillide (32) T. pinophilus AF-02 / YES liquid medium Zhai et\u00a0al., 2015\nDeacetylisowortmins A (33) T. wortmannii LGT-4 / PDA Fu et\u00a0al., 2016\nDeacetylisowortmins B (34) T. wortmannii LGT-4 / PDA Fu et\u00a0al., 2016\nTalaromyones A (35) T. stipitatus SK-4 / Autoclaved wheat solid-substrate\nmedium\nCai et\u00a0al., 2017\nTalaromyones B (36) T. stipitatus SK-4 Antibacterial; inhibit\u03b1-\nglucosidase\nAutoclaved wheat solid-substrate\nmedium\nCai et\u00a0al., 2017\nPurpactin A (37) T. stipitatus SK-4 Inhibit \u03b1-glucosidase Autoclaved wheat solid-substrate\nmedium\nCai et\u00a0al., 2017\n(Continued)\nFrontiers in Microbiology 17 frontiersin.org"
