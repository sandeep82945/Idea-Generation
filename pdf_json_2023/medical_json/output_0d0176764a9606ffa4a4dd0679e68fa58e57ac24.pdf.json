Little is known as to the regulation of tone in senescent basilar arteries. We tested the hypothesis, that thin filament mechanisms in addition to smooth muscle myosin-II regulatory-light-chain(MLC20)-phosphorylation and non-muscle-myosin-II, contribute to regulation of stretch-induced tone. In young BAs (y-BAs) mechanical stretch does not lead to spontaneous tone generation. Stretch-induced tone in y-BAs appeared only after inhibition of NO-release by L-NAME and was fully prevented by treatment with 3 \u03bcmol/L RhoA-kinase (ROK) inhibitor Y27632. L-NAME-induced tone was reduced in y-BAs from heterozygous mice carrying a point mutation of the targeting-subunit of the myosin phosphatase, MYPT1 at threonine696 (MYPT1-T696A/+). In y-BAs, MYPT1-T696A-mutation also blunted the ability of L-NAME to increase MLC20-phosphorylation. In contrast, senescent BAs (s-BAs; >24 months) developed stable spontaneous stretch-induced tone and pharmacological inhibition of NO-release by L-NAME led to an additive effect. In s-BAs the MYPT1-T696A mutation also blunted MLC20-phosphorylation, but did not prevent development of stretch-induced tone. In s-BAs from both lines, Y27632 completely abolished stretch- and L-NAME-induced tone. In s-BAs phosphorylation of non-muscle-myosin-S1943 and PAK1-T423, shown to be down-stream effectors of ROK was also reduced by Y27632 treatment. Stretch- and L-NAME tone were inhibited by inhibition of non-muscle myosin (NM-myosin) by blebbistatin. We also tested whether the substrate of PAK1 the thin-filament associated protein, caldesmon is involved in the regulation of stretch-induced tone in advanced age. BAs obtained from heterozygotes"

            "text": "We have recently shown that aging of cerebral arteries is associated with a hypercontractile state of smooth muscle (Lubomirov et al., 2017). The hypercontractile state was blunted by NO released from the endothelium and was associated with increased inhibitory phosphorylation of MYPT1 and increased filamentous F-actin protein content. However, the mechanism leading to this hypercontractile response was undetermined as there are many potential sites at which aging might act.\nVascular smooth muscle tone is primarily the result of the cyclic interaction of thick myosin filaments with filamentous actin (F-actin) in a cycle driven by ATP hydrolysis (Arner and Pfitzer, 1999). Although smooth muscle myosin II is the primary motor protein of smooth muscle contraction, there is increasing evidence that non-muscle myosin II is involved in slowly developing contractions (Morano et al., 2000) and tension maintenance ((Zhang and Gunst, 2017) reviewed in (Brozovich et al., 2016)). Regulation of smooth muscle contraction occurs by altering the level of phosphorylation of myosin, by altering the extent of actin polymerization into thin filaments, and by proteins that bind directly to actin, such as caldesmon (Morgan and Gangopadhyay, 2001). All of these points of regulation are potentially altered by aging leading to the hypercontractile state.\nBoth myosin types, smooth muscle and non-muscle myosin II, are activated by phosphorylation of regulatory light chains (MLC20) on serine19 (S19) (Zhang and Gunst, 2017). Phosphorylation is catalyzed by Ca2+-calmodulin dependent myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) in response to an increase in cytosolic [Ca2+]. The rise in Ca2+ is triggered by various extracellular stimuli such as neurotransmitters, metabolites and mechanical forces (Brozovich et al., 2016). MLC20 is phosphorylated additionally by Ca\n2+- independent, non-canonical MLC-kinases, which include RhoAkinase (ROK) (Amano et al., 1996).\nDephosphorylation of MLC20 is catalyzed by a constitutively active type 1 phosphatase (MLCP) the activity of which is modulated by phosphorylation of its myosin targeting (regulatory) subunit MYPT1 at several serine and threonine residues (Matsumura and Hartshorne, 2008). This allows force to increase or decrease without changes in cytosolic [Ca2+], a phenomenon known as Ca2+sensitization and desensitization, respectively [reviewed in (Somlyo and Somlyo, 2003)].\nThe RhoA-ROK kinase pathway is the key mechanism of increasing Ca2+-sensitivity by phosphorylation of MYPT1 at threonine-696 and threonine-853 (Matsumura and Hartshorne, 2008; Puetz et al., 2009). The nitric oxide (NO) protein kinase G (PKG) signaling cascade decreases Ca2+-sensitivity by antagonizing Rho-PKG signaling, which disinhibits MLCP by dephosphorylation of MYPT1 (Puetz et al., 2009) and/or activation of MLCP by phosphorylation of MYPT1 at the PKG site serine-668 (Yuen et al., 2011).\nForce is also diminished when actin filaments are disassembled or depolymerized. RhoA and ROK promote adhesome complex formation and polymerization of a small G-actin pool at the cell cortex upon contractile stimulation (Zhang and Gunst, 2019). Large actin filaments are anchored to the cell membrane via adhesion proteins, which contain some cortical actin polymers. They allow force to be transmitted from myofilaments to the extracellular matrix and act independently of pathways that activate crossbridge cycling (Gunst and Zhang, 2008). Interfering with actin polymerization results in diminished active force (Zhang et al., 2018). Cortical actin polymerization induced by biomechanical stimulation and contractile agonists requires recruitment of inactive adhesome proteins to membrane adhesion junctions, where they are activated (Gunst and Zhang, 2008; Zhang et al., 2015). The underlying complex signaling mechanisms have been delineated in detail in airway smooth muscle [reviewed in (Gunst and Zhang, 2008)]. They involve the small GTPase, RhoA upstream of non-muscle myosin II (Zhang and Gunst, 2017), and ROK upstream of p21-activated protein kinase (PAK) (Zhang et al., 2018), and eventual activation of the N-WASp and Arp2/3 complex.\nA growing body of evidence supports the notion that F-actin dynamics is also involved in regulation of vascular smooth muscle tone (Yamin and Morgan, 2012) and specifically in the myogenic responses of rat brain vasculature (Cipolla et al., 2002; MorenoDominguez et al., 2013; Walsh and Cole, 2013). Moreover, an increased F-actin content was associated with a hypercontractile state of old murine brain arteries (Lubomirov et al., 2017).\nPAK1 is not only an upstream activator of actin polymerization (Zhang et al., 2018), but also a stimulator of force production by phosphorylating caldesmon and reversing its inhibitory effect on actomyosin interaction (Van Eyk et al., 1998). Caldesmon is a myosin-, actin, calmodulin-, and tropomyosin-binding protein, and is expressed in two isoforms generated by alternative splicing [(Ruegg and Pfitzer, 1991; Gusev, 2001) rev. (Pfitzer et al., 1993a)].\nFrontiers in Physiology frontiersin.org02\nThe smooth muscle specific isoform, h-CaD, is found in the actomyosin domain of smooth muscle cells, where it presumably tethers actin- and myosin filaments and stabilizes the contractile machinery (Pfitzer et al., 1993b; Smolock et al., 2009; Putz et al., 2021). Both isoforms inhibit actomyosin MgATPase activity and contraction at constant MLC20 phosphorylation. CaD may act as a molecular brake of smooth muscle contraction especially at low MLC20 phosphorylation and cytosolic [Ca\n2+] (Smolock et al., 2009; Putz et al., 2021). Phosphorylation of caldesmon at several threonine and serine residues by various protein kinases, including PAK1, facilitates activation of MgATPase activity and cross bridge cycling. PAK1 is activated by ROK-dependent phosphorylation (Zhang et al., 2018), giving rise to the interesting hypothesis that ROK may relieve the normal inhibition of tension development caused by caldesmon.\nTo conclude there is evidence primarily derived from smooth muscle tissue from young animals that contractile activity is regulated in addition to the canonical pathway via phosphorylation of MLC20 by, actin based mechanisms, i.e., actin filament dynamics and/or the thin filament linked protein caldesmon. In these pathways, ROK is center stage and regulates different signaling cascades that target these mechanisms. Little is currently known about the contribution of these pathways in brain arteries from senescent mice.\nIn the present work we explored whether changes in basal phosphorylation levels of the Rho-kinase effectors MLCP, nonmuscle myosin, as well as actin filament dynamics parallel the augmented in stretch-induced tone in old basilar arteries. Further, we investigated whether ablation of the PAK1 effector, caldesmon augments stretch induced tone. Specifically we tested the following hypotheses: 1) stretch induced tone is augmented in senescent basilar arteries in a ROK-dependent manner, 2) ROK is upregulated in senescence and serves as a central signaling hub, which not only increases inhibitory phosphorylation of MYPT1 but also of non-muscle myosin and PAK1 3) the PAK1-target caldesmon acts as a molecular brake to attenuate stretch induced tension rise."

            "text": "Three different types of muscle tone were examined in this work: 1) stretch-induced tone refers to tone that is present after stretching y-BA to IC90 (90% of the internal circumference at wall tension corresponding to a transmural pressure of 100 mmHg (IC90); see expandet \u201cMethods\u201d section in online supplement) and in s-BA it refers to the slow tension rise that develops in 20\u201325 min after stretching the preparations to IC90 in the absence of treatment. This tone is maintained throughout the experiment. 2) L-NAME-induced tone develops in response to addition of L-NAME, a pan-NOS inhibitor; 3) agonist-induced tone occurs after stimulation with contractile agonist, U46619. Our first goal\nwas to determine the effect of ROK on each of these types of muscle tone.\nROK inhibition blunts stretch-, L-NAME-, and agonist-induced tone in young murine basilar arteries\nTone in the absence of L-NAME amounted to ~1.7 mN, present after the normalization procedure. To demonstrate that this increase in tone involves ROK, ring preparations from BAs were treated after the normalization procedure (20\u201325 min equilibration in PSS see \u201cMethods\u201d) with 3 \u03bcmol/L Y27632 for 10 min, followed by addition of 100 \u03bcmol/L of the pan-NOS inhibitor L-NAME for another 20 min in the presence of Y27632. Pretreatment with Y27632 did not alter stretch-induced tone (1.69 \u00b1 0.1 mN in the presence of Y27632 versus 1.73 \u00b1 0.28 in non-treated time matched controls), but prevented the increase in L-NAME induced tone, which was 1.66 \u00b1 0.1 mN in the presence of Y27632 and 2.7 \u00b1 0.5 mN in the absence of Y27632 (Figures 1A, C).\nWe then tested whether ROK inhibition also attenuated the agonist-induced tone by the thromboxaneA2 analogue, U46619. In the presence of Y27632, the cumulative concentration-response relation was shifted to the right; the pEC50 value was significantly lower with than without Y27632 in time-matched controls (6.3 \u00b1 0.1 logarithmic units vs. 7.1 \u00b1 0.18; p < 0.01; n = 5). Maximal force was also lower (Fmax 3.68 \u00b1 0.37 mN with vs. 5.89 \u00b1 1.3 mN without Y27632, p < 0.05; t-test; n = 5; Figure 1B). However, Y27632 at a concentration of 3 \u03bcmol/L (concentration able to nearly completely dephosphorylate ROK-site of targeting subunit of MLCP, MYPT1T853; Figures 5A, D; Figures 8C, D) attenuated U46619 contractile response by only ~40% compared to complete inhibition of L-NAME induced tone, suggesting that a part of the U46619induced tone involves one or more additional mechanisms, distinct from ROK activation.\nEffect of blocking phosphorylation at threonine 696 of MYPT1 on agonist-induced tone in y-BA\nThe inhibitory effect of the ROK inhibitor on L-NAME and U46619 induced tone may partially result from reduced phosphorylation of MYPT1-T696 (Puetz et al., 2009), a site that is phosphorylated by several protein kinases including ROK. Phosphorylation of this site inhibits MLCP activity in vitro (Feng et al., 1999). To test the involvement of phosphorylation this site in L-NAME and U46619 induced contractile activity, we used BAs from 2 months old wild type and heterozygous MYPT1-T696A/+ mice, in which the phosphorylation propensity of MYPT1 at T696 was genetically lowered by mutating the threonine-residue into a non-phosphorylatable alanine (MYPT1-T696A/+).\nRing preparations from MYPT1-T696A/+ and WT BA were stimulated after mounting and equilibration in PSS by cumulatively increasing concentrations of U46619. U46619 induced a concentration dependent rise in tone with similar Fmax and pEC50 values in mutant and WT littermates (p > 0.05; n = 7\u20136; Figures 1D\u2013E). After wash-out of the agonist with PSS, the vessels\nFrontiers in Physiology frontiersin.org03\nwere pre-incubated for 20 min in L-NAME (100 \u03bcmol/L), followed by a second U46619 concentration-response relation (Figures 1D, E). In time-matched controls, the second concentration-response relation was obtained in the absence of L-NAME (n = 4\u20135; Supplementary Figure S2). L-NAME shifted the U46619concentration-response curve to the left in both WT and mutant BA and increased Fmax, whereby neither Fmax nor the pEC50 values differed between MYPT1-T696A/+ and WT littermates (p > 0.05; n = 7\u20136; Figures 1D, E). No significant difference between the first and second U46619 concentration response curve was observed in time matched controls (n = 5\u20134; Supplementary Figure S2). L-NAME-induced tone was significantly less in mutant BA than in WT (mutant: 1.95 \u00b1 0.1 mN vs. WT 2.82 \u00b1 0.2 mN, n = 7\u20136; Figures 1D, F). Thus, the effect of the mutation of MYPT1 and Y27632 on L-NAME induced tone were of similar magnitude. All contractile parameters of BAs fromMYPT1-T696A/+ andWTmice are given in Table 1. L-NAME increased tone and MLC20 phosphorylation in WT but not in MYPT1T696A/+ BA from young mice Next, we tested in separate experiments whether the reduction in tone induced by L-NAME in y-BAs from MYPT1-T696A/+ mice was related to lower phosphorylation levels of the regulatory light chain of myosin (MLC20) under basal conditions. For technical reasons, the vessels were mounted on two wires (\u00f8 25 \u00b5m) but not stretched as for mechanical experiments. Basal phosphorylation levels of MLC20-S19 in WT and MYPT1-T696A/+ were similar\nFIGURE 1 Stretch-, L-NAME-, and agonist-induced force in young murine basilar arteries obtained fromWT and MYPT1-T696A/+ -mice.

In line with the attenuated force, incubation with L-NAME was associated with increased MLC20S19 phosphorylation in BA of WT, but not in BA of MYPT1T696A/+.\nWe further tested, whether observed differences in MLC20S19 phosphorylation were caused by differences in the phosphorylation of MYPT1 at T696 and T853 and thus in activity of MLCP. Under control conditions, phosphorylation of MYPT1 at T696 (PSS, no treatment) was higher in BA from WTmice than in those from MYPT1-T696A/+-mice (p < 0.05; unpaired t-test; n = 4; Figures 2A, C). Nominal maximal pMYPT1-T696 phosphorylation was assessed by stimulation with 0.1 \u03bcmol/L calyculin, a type1 phosphatase inhibitor (Chen et al., 2015). As expected, MYPT1-T696 phosphorylation in calyculin treated mutant BA amounted to only ~50% of that in WT BA (Supplementary Figure S3). We did not observe a significant change in phosphorylation of pMYPT1-T853 between WT and mutant mice, under control conditions (PSS, no treatment) or after incubation with L-NAME (Figures 2A, D). This result suggests that this site, which is phosphorylated only by ROK, is not affected by silencing phosphorylation in MYPT1-T696.\nTo test whether altered PKG activity may contribute to the lower L-NAME induced tone, we determined phosphorylation of MYPT1S695, which is specifically phosphorylated by PKG. L-NAME decreased phosphorylation of this site, indicated that NO-PKG signaling is constitutively active in this preparation. Phosphorylation of pMYPT1-S695 was similar in WT and mutant BA (Figures 2A, E). These results also indicated that the alanine mutation of T696 did not affect the phosphorylation of the neighboring S695, and further, that the NO-PKG pathway was not affected by the mutation.\nCa2+-sensitivity is lower in young, \u03b1-toxin permeabilized MYPT1-T696A/+ BA\nThe level of phosphorylation of MYPT1-T696 was proposed to define the intrinsic Ca2+-sensitivity of the contractile machinery of\nurinary bladder smooth muscle (Khromov et al., 2009). To test whether this applies to basilar arteries, we obtained Ca2+-force relations in \u03b1toxin permeabilized preparations. Permeabilization with \u03b1-toxin generates pores into the plasma membrane which allow diffusion of molecules <1 kDa into the intracellular space. This permits intracellular [Ca2+] to be controlled by EGTA so that the Ca2+-responsiveness of the contractile machinery can be measured without confounding changes in cytosolic [Ca2+]. After permeabilization, the preparations were equilibrated for 20 min in pCa >8 relaxing solution and then challenged with cumulatively increasing concentrations of [Ca2+] (Figure 3). We found that force in MYPT1-T696A/+ BA was lower than in WT BA at intermediate, but not at maximal [Ca2+] (Figure 3; Table 2). The pEC50, the neg. logarithm of concentration of Ca\n2+ for half maximal contraction, and the Hill coefficient of the Ca2+-force relation were lower than in WT (Table 2). Thus, under Ca2+-clamped conditions, the Ca2+-sensitivity was lower in mutant compared to WT vessels, consistent with a reduced inhibitory phosphorylation of MLCP. This result indicates that a lower Ca2+-sensitivity contributes to the lower L-NAME-induced tone in mutant y-BA.\nExpression of MYPT1-T696A/+ does not alter stretch-induced tone- and L-NAMEinduced tone in senescent BA\nIn contrast to y-BA, in senescent BA (s-BA, >24 months old) a slow spontaneous rise in force was observed (Figure 4A) after stretching\nFIGURE 3 Ca2+-activated contraction of basilar arteries from young WT- and MYPT1-T696A/+-mice.

This tone amounted to 3.5 \u00b1 0.9 mN in s-BAs from WT mice, which was not reduced in s-BAMYPT1-T696A/+ mice (3.1 \u00b1 1.3 mN; Figures 4A, C; n = 8). The preparations from both genotypes were then incubated with 100 \u03bcmol/ L L-NAME for 20 min, followed by stimulation with increasing concentrations of U46619 (0.001\u20133 \u03bcmol/L, Figure 4A). As in the experiments with y-BA, treatment of s-BA with 100 \u03bcML-NAME increased tone in both mouse lines to a similar extent (4.5 \u00b1 0.5 mN inWT vs. 4.2 \u00b1 0.5 mN inmutant; n= 8). However, unlike the case with y-BA, the mutation did not blunt L-NAME induced tone (Figures 4A, C). U46619 concentration-response curves were similar in s-BAs from both mouse lines (Figures 4A, C, D; Table 3).\nIn y-BAs, inhibition of ROK blunted completely L-NAMEinduced tone. We therefore investigated the effect of Y27632 in WT and MYPT1-T696A/+ s-BAs. U46619 concentration relationships and Fmax after Y27632 treatment were similar between s-BAs from both groups (Figures 4B\u2013D)."

The concentration responsiveness and Fmax of U46619 in the presence of blebbistatin (\u2212) or (+) were similar to those measured previously in Y27632 treated group (Figures 6A, C, D; Table 3).\nBlebbistatin (\u2212) unlike Y27632 did not reduce phosphorylation of pMYPT1-T696/T853 and pMLC20-S19 in s-BAs\nNext we tested whether blebbistatin reduced basal MLC20S19 phosphorylation or inhibitory phosphorylation of MYPT1. Phosphorylation of pMLC20-S19, pMYPT1-T696, and pMYPT1T853 in the presence of blebbistatin (\u2212) was determined in s-BAs from WT and from MYPT1-T696A/+ mice using phosphospecific antibodies. Neither pMLC20-S19, nor pMYPT1-T696/T853, were reduced by blebbistatin (\u2212) in BAs from both mouse lines (Figures 7A\u2013D). These experiments support the notion that the hyper-contractile phenotype of\nsenescent BAs involves increase in ROK activity and likely non-muscle myosin-II cross-bridge cycling.\nPhosphorylation of non-muscle myosin-II in young and senescent BAs\nContractile activity requires that NM myosin-II proteins assemble into filaments. A predictor of filament competent NM myosin is the level of phosphorylation of its heavy chains (MHC) at S1943 (Zhang and Gunst, 2017). Here, we tested 1) whether NM-II S1943 phosphorylation was higher in senescent than in young arteries, 2) whether Y27632 decreased phosphorylation of this site and 3) whether the expression pattern of global or IIa and IIb isoforms of NM-II are altered by senescence. Phosphorylation of NM-MHC-S1943 was quantified by Western blot analysis using phosphospecific antibodies. In s-BAs, basal S1943 phosphorylation was significantly higher under control conditions (time matched controls to the Y-27632 treated preparations) than in y-BAs (Figures 8A, B). Incubation with 3 \u03bcmol/L Y27632 reduced the\nFIGURE 6 Stretch-, L-NAME-, and U46619-induced tone in senescent basilar arteries from WT and MYPT1-T696A/+ -mice under inhibition of cross-bridge cycling of non-muscle myosin.

No difference in the expression levels of NM-II-total between y- and s-BAs was observed (Supplementary Figures S5A, B). Interestingly, using the same scan intensity, the intensity of the immunoreactive signal obtained with NM-IIa antibodies was larger than with NM-IIb antibodies, supporting the view that NM-IIa is the predominant isoform in BAs of both ages (Supplementary Figures S5A, C, D).\nIn these experiments, phosphorylation of MYPT1-T853 as a marker for ROK-activity wasmonitored in parallel. Phosphorylation of T853 was significantly higher in s-BAs than in y-BAs. In both age groups, Y27632 strongly reduced the immunoreactivity of pMYPT1T853 (Figures 8 C, D). These experiments indicate that ROK regulates NM-II S1943 phosphorylation.\nSenescence increased basal phosphorylation of PAK1-T423, a downstream effector of ROK\nPAK1 ist another target of ROK, which phosphorylates PAK1 at threonine 432 and thereby activates the enzyme (Zhang et al., 2018). We assessed the phosphorylation level of PAK1 using phosphospecific antibodies against pPAK1-T432 in Western Blots prepared with the same samples we used for analysis of NM-IIS1943- and MYPT1-T853-phosphorylation. The immunoreactive\nsignal of PAK1-T423 in s-BAs was higher than in y-BAs. In both groups, incubation with Y27632 reduced the PAK1-T423 phosphosignal (Figures 8E, F).\nEarly onset of stretch-induced tone in Cald1+/\u2212 old basilar arteries (o-BAs)\nPAK1 has several downstream targets involved in regulation of tone. One of them, caldesmon was reported to elicit a contraction without an increase in MLC20 phosphorylation when phosphorylated by PAK1 (Van Eyk et al., 1998). Thus, phosphorylation of caldesmon by PAK1 and reversal of its inhibitory effect on cross-bridge cycling is a potential mechanism that could account for the stretch-induced tone in s-BAs. Unfortunately, there are no commercial phosphospecific antibodies available to test whether caldesmon was phosphorylated by PAK1. Therefore, we investigated the involvement of caldesmon in the regulation of stretch-induced tone in arteries from heterozygous mice, carrying one allele in which Cald1 gene was deleted by homologous recombination of the Cald1 gene (Putz et al., 2021). As homozygosity is prenatally lethal, only heterozygous mice (Cald1+/\u2212) were employed (Putz et al., 2021). In heterozygous old basilar arteries (20\u201321months old; o-BAs) expression of caldesmon was ~50% lower than in WT mice (n = 4, Figures 9A, B). Interestingly, stretch-induced tone was observed in o-BAs obtained from heterozygotes Cald1+/\u2212 mice at an earlier age of 20\u201321months, compared to the BAs from controls\nFIGURE 7 Phosphorylation of pMYPT1-T696, pMYPT1-T853, and pMLC20-S19 in senescent basilar arteries from WT and MYPT1-T696A/+ mice under inhibition of cross-bridge cycling of non-muscle myosin.

At this age, o-BAs from WT mice did not exhibit stretch-induced tone yet (Figures 9C, D). The magnitude of stretchinduced tone of o-BAs from Cald1+/\u2212 mice was similar to that in WT s-BAs (3.5 \u00b1 0.9 mN in s-BAs fromWTs vs. 3.5 \u00b1 0.6 mN in o-BAs from Cald1+/\u2212; n = 8). There was no difference between both genotypes considering L-NAME- and U46619-induced tone (Figures 9C, E). As in previous experiments, application of 3 \u03bcmol/L Y27632 reduced stretchinduced tone in both groups (Figures 9C\u2013F). We did not observe significant differences in stretch-induced or L-NAME-induced tone, nor in maximal -induced tone between y-BAs from WT and Cald1+/\u2212 mice (12\u201314 weeks old) (Supplementary Figure S4). Inhibition of cross-bridge cycling by caldesmon is exerted by the C-terminal, actin-binding domain (Pfitzer et al., 1993b). Binding to myosin was proposed to position caldesmon in such a way that the actin-binding domain can inhibit cross-bridge cycling (Lee et al., 2000). We tested this in a second mouse line, CaD-\u0394Ex2\u2212/\u2212, in which expression of the strong myosin binding domain, which is encoded by Exon 2 of the Cald1 gene, was ablated (Figure 10) (Pfitzer et al., 2005). Expression of the truncated CaD did not differ from WT (Figure 10A). Whereas WT CaD bound to myosin in solution, binding was nearly abolished in truncated caldesmon (CaD-\u0394Ex2\u2212/\u2212) (Figure 10B). Binding to actin was not affected (Figure 10B). o-BAs from homozygous mice expressing the truncated caldesmon were subjected to the same protocols used in previous experiments. No significant change of vascular tone in o-BAs from CaD-\u0394Ex2\u2212/\u2212mice compared to their time matchedWT controls was observed (Figures 10C\u2013F).\nFIGURE 8 Phosphorylation of NM-II-S1943, MYPT1-T853, and PAK-T423 in basilar arteries from young and senescent mice under control conditions and after inhibition of ROK.

To validate that targeting of MYPT1-T696 does not influence F-actin polymerization, we next measured the G/F-actin ratio in s-BAs from WT and MYPT1-T696A/+ animals. No change of G-actin immunoreactivity in supernatants, used as read out for the G-actin fractions, was detected in BAs from WT compared to MYPT1-T696A/+ animals (Figures 11A, B). In the next series of experiments, we investigated whether maximal stimulation with calyculin resulted in a redistribution of F-actin in favor of subcortical actin. Calyculin treatment induced a maximal increase in force, starting 7\u201310 min after application and reached its maximum after 30 min (not shown). In the previous experiments, we showed that in BAs, calyculin treatment maximally activates ROK as seen by phosphorylation of MYPT1-T853 (Figure 7A). Alexa Fluor\u2122 555 phalloidin staining of F-actin filaments showed changes in localization in endothelial and smooth muscle cells. In s-BA endothelial cells F-actin localized to the cortex, while F-actin, stained by Alexa Fluor\u2122 555 phalloidin, in endothelium of y-BAs was diffuse and could not be attributed to a subcellular niche (Figures 11C, D). Interestingly, in smooth muscle cells from y-BAs F-actin localized predominantly to the cell-poles (Figure 11C).\nFIGURE 9 Effect of Caldesmon targeting on tone maintenance in basilar arteries from old mice.

            "text": "Stretch-induced vascular tone is an important element of autoregulatory adaptation of the cerebral circulatory system. It maintains constant cerebral flow, despite changes in perfusion pressure, and thus ensures adequate brain perfusion. The present work provides novel insights into the mechanisms of regulation of the stretch-induced tone of murine BA in senescence. 1) In young BAs (y-BAs) mechanical stretch did not lead to spontaneous tone generation, while the senescent-BAs (s-BAs) developed stable stretch-induced tone. 2) Stretch-induced tone in y-BAs appeared only after inhibition of NO-release by L-NAME, whereas in s-BAs such an inhibition led to an additive effect. 3) In BAs from both age groups, stretch-induced tone was fully inhibited by treatment with a ROK-inhibitor, Y27632. 4) Lowering of the phosphorylation propensity of MYPT1 in heterozygous mice carrying the point mutation MYPT1-T696A/+ prevented stretch-induced tone in y-BAs but not in aged BAs.

Based on this, we propose that regulation of stretch-induced tone in senescent arteries involves alternative mechanism. 5) The basal phosphorylation level of NM-II and PAK1, which phosphorylates and inhibits caldesmon, were higher in s-BAs than in y-BAs, and were reduced by the ROK inhibitor, Y27632. 6) Ablation of caldesmon augmented stretch-induced tone in old BAs suggesting that it acts as a molecular brake on stretch-induced tone in aged BAs. We propose that in senescent cerebral vessels, mechanisms distinct from MLC20 phosphorylation contribute to regulation of tone in the absence of a contractile agonist. The onset of senescence is associated with MLC20-independent mechanisms of cerebrovascular tone regulation There is ample evidence that stretch-induced cerebrovascular tone in young arteries relates to two important components, namely, 1) the plasma membrane depolarization, leading to a rise in intracellular Ca2+-concentration and activation of the specific Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, MLCK, and 2) Ca2+sensitization via inhibition of MLCP (Walsh and Cole, 2013), both inducing an increase in phosphorylation of MLC20. Here, we show\nFIGURE 11 G/F actin ratio in basilar arteries from senescent WT and MYPT1-T696A/+ animals under basal conditions.

In both y-BAs and s-BAs, there is a rapid rise in tone followed by a decline to a lower level upon stepwise stretching the vessels to IC90 during the normalization procedure as expected from the length tension relation. The tone at IC90 is stable in y-BAs during the whole experiment, i.e., there is no slow increase in tone, and basal tone recovers after washout of the contractile agonist U46619. In contrast, in s-BAs tone at IC90 is not stable, but rather slowly increases. This rise in tone we denote as stretch-induced tone. In y-BAs, such a stretch-induced tone was observed only after inhibition of NO-signaling by L-NAME.\nAt both ages, the developed stretch-induced tone and L-NAME induced tone were inhibited by the ROK inhibitor Y27632, putting ROK center stage in regulating tone in basilar arteries, noteworthy, even in the absence of a contractile agonist. Our experiments indicate that not only NO-PKG signaling (Lubomirov et al., 2017; Lubomirov et al., 2018), but also ROK signaling is constitutively active in BAs. In y-BAs, NO-PKG signaling, known to inhibit RhoA-ROK-MLCP signaling at different levels along the pathway, prevents the spontaneous rise in force, while in s-BAs, the balance between NO-PKG and ROK signaling is shifted in favor of the latter. The mechanisms that underlie the constitutive activity of ROK unmasked by inhibition of NO-release are currently unknown. It is possible that stretching the vessels, either by opening of stretch sensitive cation channels (Mederos y Schnitzler et al., 2011) and/or by activating G-protein receptors (Momotani et al., 2011; Takefuji et al., 2013) leads to a Ca2+-influx, which then via tyrosine kinase Pyk2 might activate Rho-ROK signaling [(Mills et al., 2015); reviewed in (Brozovich et al., 2016)]. It is of interest that in aged renal vessels phosphorylation and activity of 90 kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK2) are higher than in young renal vessels (Lubomirov et al., in press). RSK2 is a non-canonical MLC20kinase (Suizu et al., 2000; Artamonov et al., 2018) and also activates ROK (Shi et al., 2018), and hence may be responsible for stretch-induced tone in s-BAs. We are currently exploring this possibility.\nThe downstream targets of ROK appear to differ between y-BA and s-BA. In y-BA, ROK appears to act through the canonical pathway, i.e., ROK-induced inhibitory phosphorylation of MYPT1 at T696 and T853, resulted in an increase in phosphorylation of MLC20 [reviewed in Puetz et al. (2009)]. We do not exclude the possibility that a rise in intracellular Ca2+concentration also leads to MLC20 phosphorylation and increase in tone. The ROK inhibitor, Y27632, lowers phosphorylation of both sites, thus increasing the activity of MLCP, which in turn lowers MLC20 phosphorylation. Y27632 prevents the increase in L-NAMEinduced force. However, which one of the two residues or perhaps both are responsible for MLCP inhibition is under debate (Feng et al., 1999; Khromov et al., 2009). To address this, we used a mouse model (MYPT1-T696A/+ mice), in which the phosphorylation propensity of T696 was genetically lowered. In y-BAs, the mutation prevented L-NAME induced tension and phosphorylation of MLC20, as did Y27632.\nSurprisingly, stretch-induced tone in s-BAs, although ROK dependent, appears not to be mediated by MLC20 phosphorylation. This notion is based on the observation that basal MLC20 phosphorylation but not stretch-induced tone was\nreduced in s-BAs carrying the MYPT1-T696A/+ mutation. In other words, stretch-induced tone develops in s-BAs despite low levels of MLC20 phosphorylation. As the vessels for phosphorylation determination were not stretched because of technical reasons, albeit pharmacological treatment was identical to the mechanical experiment, we cannot exclude the possibility that stretching the vessel would have increased MLC20-phosphorylation. These data are in contrast to our previous observation, where the T696A mutation reduced both, phosphorylation of MLC20 and tone in young and old cerebral arteries (Lubomirov et al., 2017; Lubomirov et al., 2018). It appears from our study that regulation of cerebrovascular tone in young and old age occurs predominantly through MLC20 phosphorylation, the canonical pathway, whereas in senescence these pathways play a minor role.\nNM-II and PAK1, important ROK downstream-effector-proteins, regulate stretch-induced tone in senescence\nSeveral non-canonical pathways, in addition to the canonical one, have been shown to regulate tone in tracheal (Zhang and Gunst, 2019), and vascular smooth muscle (Kim et al., 2010; Moreno-Dominguez et al., 2013) by acting through both actin and NM-II. A series of recent publications demonstrated that ROK regulates polymerization of subcortical actin at cell adhesomes in response to contractile stimuli (Zhang et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2018). Actin polymerization and assembly are multistep processes involving a large number of other regulatory proteins.\nFurthermore, according to Gunst and co-workers (Zhang et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2018), key events are RhoA mediated NM-II filament assembly, as well as ROK mediated phosphorylation and activation of PAK1. Our study suggests that these events are also involved in regulating stretch-induced tone and L-NAME induced contractions in senescence, notably in the absence of a contractile agonist. Phosphorylation of both NM-II and PAK1 was much more prominent in s-BAs than in y-BAs and was reduced by Y27632 in s-BAs along with the attenuation of stretch-induced tone and L-NAME induced tone. We note that global inhibition of phosphatase activity using calyculin resulted in increased subcortical F-actin (Figure 11). Our findings are in keeping with a previous report that myogenic tone was associated with a small increase in filamentous actin (Moreno-Dominguez et al., 2013). Different from airway smooth muscle, where these phosphorylation events play an important role in agonist induced contraction at young age [reviewed in Zhang et al. (2015)], they appear to be silenced in cerebral arteries in young age, but they are markers of cerebrovascular senescence and intrinsically active, i.e., in the absence of a contractile agonist.\nCaldesmon acts as a molecular brake on stretch-induced tone\nIn addition to activation of signaling molecules that eventually lead to actin polymerization, PAK1 also works through the actin\nFrontiers in Physiology frontiersin.org15\nbinding protein caldesmon. Phosphorylation of caldesmon reverses its inhibitory effect on actomyosin MgATPase activity thereby increasing force in skinned smooth muscle at low levels of MLC20 phosphorylation (Van Eyk et al., 1998). Technically, it was not possible to monitor PAK1 mediated phosphorylation of caldesmon due to lack of commercial antibodies. Nor was it possible to inhibit caldesmon-phosphorylation by PAK1. Therefore, we used BAs from heterozygous mice, in which the Cald1 gene was ablated, thus reducing the caldesmon content to ~50% of WT mice (Figure 9). The decrease in caldesmon level was expected to reduce its inhibitory activity. Old BAs from Cald1+/\u2212 mice exhibited stretch-induced tone at an age in which stretchinduced tone was not yet present in WT. Similar to our findings, downregulation of caldesmon in carotid arteries ex vivo by siRNA resulted in cross-bridge cycling in unstimulated tissue (Smolock et al., 2009). It is noteworthy that caldesmon immunoreactivity dramatically decreased as a long-term consequence of subarachnoid hemorrhage (Oka et al., 1996; Doi et al., 1997) a status, which is typically associated with a hyper-contractile response of the vasculature. Our finding corroborates previous findings (Smolock et al., 2009; Putz et al., 2021) showing that caldesmon acts as a molecular brake on tone in aged cerebral vessels (Figure 9). Inhibition of caldesmon by phosphorylation, e.g., by upregulation of ROK-PAK1 signaling cascade in senescence, might therefore be a mechanism that leads to a hyper-contractile state in the absence of a contractile stimulus in senescence. Interestingly, myogenic constriction in young rat cerebral arteries was not associated with altered caldesmon phosphorylation, and was proposed not to be involved in tone regulation (Moreno-Dominguez et al., 2014).\nCaldesmon, which is expressed in smooth muscle cells of the walls of visceral organs as well as in the vasculature including the medial layer of human cerebral vessels (Kacem et al., 2006), has two important functional domains (Morgan and Gangopadhyay, 2001). Inhibition of actomyosin interaction is exerted by the C-terminal actin-binding domain (Katsuyama et al., 1992; Pfitzer et al., 1993a), while the N-terminal domain binds to myosin and was proposed to be important for positioning caldesmon (Hemric and Chalovich, 1990; Lee et al., 2000). Blocking of myosin binding by inhibitory peptides resulted in an increase in resting tone in permeabilized arteries (Pfitzer et al., 2005). Ablation of exon2 of the Cald1 gene in mice (CaD-\u0394Ex2\u2212/\u2212), which encodes the strong myosin binding domain, resulted in expression of a truncated caldesmon but the expression level did not differ from WT mice. In vitro binding of the truncated caldesmon, isolated from these mice, had lost myosin but not actin binding (Figure 10). However, vascular tone in o-BAs from homozygous CaD-\u0394Ex2\u2212/\u2212 mice was not different from that in WT mice. This indicates that the C-terminal domain is sufficient for inhibition of force.\nTaken together, our work corroborated the notion of the central role ROK has as a signaling node that orchestrates several downstream processes, essential for regulating vascular tone both in y- and s-BAs. Our observations expand previous reports that inhibition of ROK reduced vascular tone of pulmonary, cerebral, coronary, and mesenteric arteries from\ndifferent species including humans, typically performed in young arteries (Fu et al., 1998; Matsumura et al., 2001; Kitazono et al., 2002; Grisk et al., 2012). However, our work suggests that the downstream ROK activated processes differ especially in senescent cerebral arteries from those in young and old ones. We propose that in y-and o-BAs the canonical pathways, i.e., inhibition of MLCP by ROK and increase in phosphorylation of MLC20, predominate tone regulation, while in senescence regulation of tone involves ROK related thin filament linked mechanisms."

            "text": "Several in vivo studies in animal models demonstrated that ROK inhibition prevented coronary and cerebral artery vasospasm and neointimal formation after balloon injury of carotid arteries (Kandabashi et al., 2000; Sato et al., 2000; Sawada et al., 2000). However, ROK inhibition may have a number of unwanted side effects. This is because ROK serves as a master regulator in non-muscle cells, regulating such diverse functions as cell-motility, -migration, and -adhesion, thrombocyte aggregation, tumor cell activity as well as the barrier function of endothelial cells (Aslan and McCarty, 2013; Constantin, 2016; Kataoka and Ogawa, 2016; Shimokawa et al., 2016).\n1. Therefore, one goal of the present work was to delineate the ROK substrates NM-II and PAK1-phosphorylation as regulators of spontaneous tone generation in the senescent cerebrovascular system. Based on our study, it is reasonable to conduct further studies, investigating whether targeting of these phosphoproteins would be an approach to treat cerebrovascular dysfunction in the elderly. 2. Genetically lowering caldesmon expression leads to early onset of spontaneous contractions in o-BAs, typical for senescence. Therefore, it will be intriguing to investigate, at least in animal models, whether re-expression or overexpression of caldesmon would be able to prevent hypercontractility in cerebral vasculature."
