Enhanced Model Selection and Weighting Strategies: Investigating advanced model selection and dynamic weighting algorithms to further improve the accuracy and robustness of the ensemble forecasting approach. This could involve the development of more sophisticated criteria for weighting model outputs based on a broader set of performance metrics, or the use of machine learning techniques to dynamically select the most appropriate models for different forecasting conditions.

Integration of Additional Data Sources: Expanding the input feature set by incorporating additional data sources such as social media data, economic indicators, or more granular weather forecasting data. This would explore the impact of wider societal and environmental factors on load forecasting accuracy and investigate how these data sources can be effectively integrated into the forecasting model.

Long-term Load Forecasting: Extending the proposed forecasting approach to long-term horizons, such as weeks, months, or even years ahead. This research would involve adapting the ensemble model to handle the different characteristics and uncertainties associated with long-term predictions, possibly by incorporating macroeconomic indicators, long-term weather patterns, and trends in energy consumption and generation.

Real-time Adaptive Forecasting Systems: Developing a real-time, adaptive forecasting system that can update its predictions based on incoming data. This would involve creating a framework that can seamlessly incorporate new data, adjust model weights, and even re-train models on-the-fly to adapt to changing grid conditions, enhancing the operational efficiency of power systems.

Exploring the Impact of Decentralized Energy Resources: With the increasing penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) and microgrids, there's a need to understand their impact on load forecasting. Future research could focus on developing models that specifically account for the variability and uncertainty introduced by DERs, including renewable energy sources, energy storage systems, and demand response initiatives. This would also involve studying the interaction between DERs and the wider grid to optimize both forecasting accuracy and grid stability.
