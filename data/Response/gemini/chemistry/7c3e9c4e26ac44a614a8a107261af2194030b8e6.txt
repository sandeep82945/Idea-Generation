1. **Investigate the mechanism of action of the dirhodium(II,II) metallodendrimers.** This could be done by studying the interactions of the metallodendrimers with DNA, proteins, and other cellular components.
2. **Explore the use of different dendritic scaffolds for the synthesis of dirhodium(II,II) metallodendrimers.** This could lead to the development of metallodendrimers with improved solubility, stability, and cytotoxicity.
3. **Evaluate the in vivo antitumor activity of the dirhodium(II,II) metallodendrimers.** This could be done by using animal models of cancer.
4. **Investigate the potential of the dirhodium(II,II) metallodendrimers for use in combination with other cancer therapies.** This could lead to the development of more effective and less toxic cancer treatments.
5. **Explore the use of the dirhodium(II,II) metallodendrimers for the targeted delivery of drugs to cancer cells.** This could be done by functionalizing the metallodendrimers with targeting ligands that bind to specific receptors on cancer cells.
