    "abstractText": "We carried out electrical resistivity and X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies on the filled skutterudite superconductors LaPt4Ge12 and PrPt4Ge12 under hydrostatic pressure. The superconducting transition temperature Tc is linearly suppressed upon increasing pressure, though the effect of pressure on Tc is rather weak. From the analysis of the XRD data, we obtain bulk moduli of B = 106 GPa and B = 83 GPa for LaPt4Ge12 and PrPt4Ge12, respectively. The knowledge of the bulk modulus allows us to compare the dependence of Tc on the unit-cell volume from our pressure study directly with that found in the substitution series La1\u2212xPrxPt4Ge12. We find that application of hydrostatic pressure can be characterized mainly as a volume effect in LaPt4Ge12 and PrPt4Ge12, while substitution of Pr for La in La1\u2212xPrxPt4Ge12 yields features going beyond a simple picture.",

            "text": "The family of filled skutterudite compounds MPt4Ge12 crystallizes in the cubic LaFe4P12-type structure [1]. Depending on the filler metal ions M a variety of different ground states has been reported. The Pt\u2013Ge framework is capable of incorporating the alkaline-earth metals Sr and Ba [2,3] rare-earth metals La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, and Eu [3] as well as the actinides Th [4] and U [5].\nNdPt4Ge12 and EuPt4Ge12 display complex magnetic phase diagrams at low temperatures [6], SmPt4Ge12 is an intermediate valence compound not showing any ordering phenomena [7,8] and CePt4Ge12 sits at the border between intermediate valence of Ce and heavy-fermion behavior [8\u201311]. Finally, several MPt4Ge12 compounds (M = Sr, Ba, La, Pr, and Th) become superconductors with Tc up to 8.3 K [2,3,5]. The two superconducting family members LaPt4Ge12 and PrPt4Ge12, with Tc of 8.3 K and 7.9 K, respectively [3], have drawn a lot of attention due to their relatively high Tc and their unusual superconducting properties. It is important to note that the Pr ion is in a singlet crystalline electric field ground state in PrPt4Ge12 and therefore nonmagnetic at low temperatures [3,12].\nThe nature of the superconducting order parameter in LaPt4Ge12 and PrPt4Ge12 is still under debate. In PrPt4Ge12, there are indications for the presence of point nodes in the superconducting energy-gap function from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) [13], specific heat and penetration depth [14] measurements. Furthermore, several physical probes suggest the multi-band character of superconductivity in PrPt4Ge12 [14\u201322]. Moreover, there is convincing evidence for time-reversal-symmetry breaking superconductivity in PrPt4Ge12 provided by muon-spin-rotation (\u00b5SR) experiments [12,23\u201325].\nMaterials 2022, 15, 2743. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma15082743 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nIn LaPt4Ge12, the situation concerning the nature of the superconducting gap is less clear than in PrPt4Ge12. There is evidence for a single isotropic gap from specific heat and thermal conductivity [26], NMR [9], and photoelectron spectroscopy [15], while other studies using specific heat [19], \u00b5SR and penetration-depth measurements [27], and Fermisurface studies [22] point at a multi-gap superconducting order parameter. In contrast, the continuous evolution of the superconducting Tc along the substitution series La1\u2212xPrxPt4Ge12 suggests compatible order parameters of both series end compounds [12,25]. Indications for time-reversal symmetry breaking are absent in LaPt4Ge12 [12], but they are observed for Pr concentrations x & 0.5 in La1\u2212xPrxPt4Ge12 [25]. What remains unclear is the origin of the pronounced minimum in Tc(x) around x \u2248 0.75 [12,25]. Its position does not seem to be related with the observation of the time-reversal symmetry breaking superconductivity. In contrast to Tc(x), the unit-cell volume decreases monotonously with increasing x in the series in La1\u2212xPrxPt4Ge12. This calls for hydrostatic pressure experiments on LaPt4Ge12 and PrPt4Ge12 to investigate the effect of a change in the unit-cell volume on the superconducting properties avoiding the complications of chemical substitution.\nIn the present paper, we performed an electrical resistivity and X-ray diffraction (XRD) study under hydrostatic pressure on LaPt4Ge12 and PrPt4Ge12. By combining the results from both experiments we obtain the dependence of the superconducting transition temperature on the unit-cell volume V of the cubic crystal structure for both compounds. This allows us to compare directly the effect of hydrostatic pressure on superconductivity in the end member compounds with that in the substitution series La1\u2212xPrxPt4Ge12. We find a linear in volume dependence of Tc(V) in our pressure study on LaPt4Ge12 and PrPt4Ge12, in contrast to the nonmonotonic dependence of Tc(V) in the substitution series."

            "text": "The electrical resistivity and XRD experiments under hydrostatic pressure were carried out on single crystals of LaPt4Ge12 and PrPt4Ge12. The details of the sample preparation and characterization can be found in Ref. [28].\nFour probe electrical-resistance measurements on LaPt4Ge12 and PrPt4Ge12 were carried out using an LR700 resistance bridge (Linear Research). Temperatures down to 1.8 K and magnetic fields up to 9 T were achieved in a Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS, Quantum Design). Pressures up to 2.74 GPa were generated in a double-layer piston-cylinder type pressure cell using silicon oil as pressure-transmitting medium [29]. The pressure dependence of the superconducting transition temperature of a piece of lead mounted along the whole sample space served as pressure gauge. The narrow superconducting transition width at all pressures confirmed the good hydrostatic pressure conditions inside the pressure cell.\nThe powder XRD data were obtained at the Extreme Methods of Analysis (EMA) beamline at the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory. The EMA beamline uses, as Xrays source, a 22 mm period Kyma undulator that delivers photons between 5 keV (3rd harmonic) and 30 keV (13th harmonic). The outgoing beam is monochromatized by a liquid N2 cooled high-resolution double crystal monochromator that uses two sets of Si crystals ([111] or [311]). Finally, an achromatic set of K-B mirrors focuses the beam at the sample position with a spot size down to 1.0 \u00b5m\u00d7 0.5 \u00b5m [30]. The measurements were carried out at ambient temperature using a 20 keV (9th harmonic, \u03bb = 0.6199 \u00c5) beam with a spot size of 15 \u00b5m\u00d7 15 \u00b5m at the sample. The two-dimensional diffraction images were captured in a transmission geometry by a CCD MAR165 detector with pixel size of 73.2 \u00b5m\u00d7 73.2 \u00b5m. These images were integrated in Dioptas 0.4.0 [31]. We used the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) standard reference material 660c (LaB6) for calibration of detector distance and other geometrical parameters. The single-crystalline samples were powdered and loaded each one into a diamond anvil cell (DAC) along with a ruby ball using a stainless steel gasket. The pressure was determined in situ by the wavelength of the position of the maximum of the second peak of the ruby fluorescence. We used a mixture of methanol-ethanol (4:1) as pressure transmitting\nmedium. The pressure was controlled by a gas-membrane mechanism that was attached to the DAC."

            "text": "The temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity (\u03c1) for LaPt4Ge12 and PrPt4Ge12 under various hydrostatic pressures (p) up to 2.74 GPa is shown in Figure 1a,b. For both materials \u03c1(T) exhibits metallic behavior at all pressures, before a jump to zero resistance indicates the onset of superconductivity at low temperatures.\nWe first turn to the results on LaPt4Ge12. At ambient pressure, zero resistance is observed below Tc,zero = 8.12 K (inset of Figure 1a). The temperature at the midpoint of the resistive transition Tc,mid = 8.24 K agrees well with previous reports [3,9]. Increasing pressure leads to a decrease in the isothermal resistivity at room temperature (\u03c1300K) up\nto 2.58 GPa before it starts to increase slightly again. Tc,zero(p) decreases only weakly with increasing pressure, by 0.14 K between ambient pressure and 2.74 GPa, the highest pressure of our investigation. Considering the scatter in the data, Tc(p) can be described by a straight line, as depicted in the central inset of Figure 1. A linear fit to the data results in a slope of dTc(p)/dp = \u221253 mK/GPa, corresponding to a normalized initial slope of 1/Tc \u00d7 dTc/dp = d(ln Tc)/dp = \u22120.0064 GPa\u22121. We do not observe any considerable change in the width of the superconducting transition in \u03c1(T) in the whole pressure range. For PrPt4Ge12, we observed \u03c1 = 0 at ambient pressure below Tc,zero = 7.7 K as shown in the inset of Figure 1b. Upon increasing pressure, we find a monotonous decrease in \u03c1300K(p) in the whole investigated pressure range. Tc,zero(p) exhibits a much stronger pressure dependence than for LaPt4Ge12. Tc,zero(p) drops by 0.26 K from 0 to 2.74 GPa. Considering the scatter in the data, a linear fit describes the data reasonably well and gives a slope of dTc(p)/dp = \u221285 mK/GPa and d(ln Tc)/dp = \u22120.011 GPa\u22121, see central inset of Figure 1. We note that Foroozani et al. reported a larger slope dTc(p)/dp obtained from an analysis of magnetic susceptibility measurements on a polycrystal [32]. Surprisingly, the normalized initial slope for PrPt4Ge12, d(ln Tc)/dp = \u22120.011 GPa\u22121 is almost twice as large as for LaPt4Ge12, d(ln Tc)/dp = \u22120.0064 GPa\u22121. To determine the temperature dependence of the superconducting upper-critical field, Hc2(T), we conducted measurements of \u03c1(T) in different magnetic fields for all pressures. Representative \u03c1(T) data are shown in the insets of Figure 2 for LaPt4Ge12 and PrPt4Ge12, respectively. The main panels display the Hc2(T) derived from the resistivity data for selected pressures. For LaPt4Ge12 the superconducting transition in \u03c1(T) gradually broadens with increasing magnetic field as shown for 1.5 GPa in the inset of Figure 2a. There is almost no difference in the Hc2(T) curves at different pressures. In the accessible temperature range above 1.8 K, Hc2(T) exhibits an almost linear temperature dependence only a small curvature develops at high field while a small tail is observable in Hc2(T) close to Tc. The weak tail close to Tc is consistent with multi-band superconductivity. An extrapolation of Hc2(T) to zero temperature gives an upper threshold of \u00b50H0c2 \u2248 1.6 T for the upper-critical field. The pressure data are consistent with experiments on a polycrystalline sample at ambient pressure down to lower temperatures (open symbols in Figure 2a).Therefore, we may conclude that the upper-critical field, H0c2, does not change significantly with pressure in LaPt4Ge12 in the studied pressure range. The results of the same experiments on PrPt4Ge12 are shown in Figure 2b for selected pressures. The shape of the Hc2(T) curves is similar as described for LaPt4Ge12 above. Hc2(T) displays a small tail close to Tc, indicative of multi-band superconductivity, and already starts to bend over at the lowest accessible temperature. The effect of pressure on Hc2(T) is also small, but it is more pronounced than in the case of LaPt4Ge12. An upper threshold of \u00b50H0c2 \u2248 1.8 T can be estimated from an extrapolation of Hc2(T) to zero temperature. The extrapolated value agrees well with literature [33]. \u03c1(T) data in different magnetic fields at a pressure of 0.02 and 2.74 GPa are shown in the lower and upper insets of Figure 2b, respectively. The broadening of the superconducting transition with increasing magnetic field observed in \u03c1(T) at low pressures, here 0.02 GPa is shown, is absent at 2.74 GPa. At this pressure, the transition remains sharp up to the highest field where we can access the transition in our experimental temperature range. This is remarkable since Tc,zero, respectively, the Hc2(T) curves are nearly unchanged by the application of pressure up to 2.74 GPa.\nFigure 3a,b shows the XRD data taken at room temperature for several pressures on LaPt4Ge12 and PrPt4Ge12, respectively. Both compounds maintain the cubic structural phase in the entire range of pressure studied up to 7.5 GPa. We can clearly identify three reflections associated with the [200], [220], and [301] planes. They are slightly shifted to higher angles upon increasing pressure, as expected due to the contraction of the crystal lattice. We used the Le-Bail method implemented in GSAS-II software package [34] to calculate the lattice parameter a as a function of pressure for both compounds. We note that here we only used the diffracted peak position to estimate the lattice parameters since the intensity and shape of the peak in our data are affected by the poor grain distribution due to small amount of sample in the DAC combined with small spot size of the beam.\nThe pressure dependence of the unit-cell volume obtained from the experimental lattice parameters of LaPt4Ge12 and PrPt4Ge12 were fitted using the Birch-Murnaghan equation of state,\np(V) = 3B 2 [( V0 V ) 7 3 \u2212 ( V0 V ) 5 3 ]{ 1 + 3 4 (B\u2032 \u2212 4) [( V0 V ) 2 3 \u2212 1 ]} ,\nwith V0 the unit-cell volume, the bulk modulus B and its pressure derivative B\u2032, all at zero pressure. Figure 3c displays the results and affirms the high quality of the fits. We obtained V0 = (641.44\u00b1 0.3) \u00c53 and V0 = (638.5\u00b1 0.6) \u00c53 for LaPt4Ge12 and PrPt4Ge12, respectively. These values agree well with the experimental unit-cell volume at ambient pressure within the error-bars [28]. We further obtained the bulk modulus and its pressure derivative for LaPt4Ge12, B0 = (106\u00b1 5) GPa and B\u2032 = (14\u00b1 2), and for PrPt4Ge12, B0 = (83\u00b1 8) GPa and B\u2032 = (23\u00b1 4). We note that our experimental value for the bulk modulus of LaPt4Ge12 compares reasonably well with results from a density functional theory calculation by T\u00fct\u00fcnc\u00fc et al. [35]. There are no calculations available for PrPt4Ge12."

The unit-cell volume of PrPt4Ge12 is about 0.43% smaller than that of LaPt4Ge12 [28]. Therefore, in a simple picture, PrPt4Ge12 can be considered as a chemically pressurized analog of LaPt4Ge12, since the Pr-ion in PrPt4Ge12 is in a non-magnetic singlet crystalline electric field ground state [3,9]. In particular, no 4 f magnetism competes with superconductivity [12]. Upon substituting Pr for La Tc(x) decreases continuously up to x \u2248 0.75, where a minimum develops before Tc(x) increases again toward stoichiometric PrPt4Ge12 [12,25]. The nonmonotonous behavior of Tc(x) and the appearance of time-reversal-breaking superconductivity in the substitution series La1\u2212xPrxPt4Ge12 indicate that volume effects alone cannot explain the observed behavior, in particular, since substitution of La by Pr reduces the unit-cell volume linearly as function of x [12,25].\nUsing the results from our XRD study, we can calculate the unit-cell volume corresponding to the applied hydrostatic pressure in our electrical-transport experiments. Figure 4 presents the resulting T \u2013 V phase diagram. It combines the results of our pressure study on LaPt4Ge12 and PrPt4Ge12 with literature data on the substitution series La1\u2212xPrxPt4Ge12 [3,12,25]. We note that the structural parameters in our study as well as the ones in the studies on the substitution series were determined at room temperature. Since the thermal contraction of LaPt4Ge12 and PrPt4Ge12 is very similar this does not affect the discussion below [28]. The superconducting transition temperatures in LaPt4Ge12 and PrPt4Ge12 depend in a simple linear relation on the unit-cell volume. From fits to the data, we obtain comparable slopes of dTc(V)/dV = \u221211.93 mK/\u00c53 and dTc(V)/dV = \u221215.65 mK/\u00c53 for LaPt4Ge12 and PrPt4Ge12, respectively (see Figure 4). We note that due to the different bulk moduli of the two materials, the difference in dTc(V)/dV between LaPt4Ge12 and PrPt4Ge12 appears to be considerably smaller than the difference in the pressure dependence dTc(p)/dp. In contrast to the simple linear and weak dependence of Tc on the unit-cell volume in LaPt4Ge12 and PrPt4Ge12, Tc(V) display a much stronger and non-monotonous volume dependence in the substitution series La1\u2212xPrxPt4Ge12, as can be seen in Figure 4.\nFermi-surface studies on LaPt4Ge12 and PrPt4Ge12 find that their electronic band structures are nearly identical with moderately enhanced effective masses for the six bands crossing at the Fermi energy [22]. These findings are in line with phonon mediated Cooper pairing and consistent with multi-gap superconductivity in both compounds [22]. A phonon mediated superconducting coupling mechanism has been indeed suggested for LaPt4Ge12 [35]. It is therefore not surprising that Tc exhibits the same dependence on V in LaPt4Ge12 and PrPt4Ge12. The similarities in the band structure are further in agreement with the continuous evolution of Tc in the substitution series. However, Tc(V) in the substitution series La1\u2212xPrxPt4Ge12 displays a non-monotonous behavior with a pronounced minimum. Furthermore, there is evidence for time-reversal-symmetry breaking superconductivity in the substitution series, which is absent on the La-rich side [25]. We may therefore speculate that in LaPt4Ge12 and PrPt4Ge12, application of pressure in the investigated pressure range leads to a rigid shift of the band structure, similar to the findings in BaPt4\u2212xAuxGe12, where a linear change in Tc(V) has been observed before and\nrelated to a rigid shift of the electronic band structure [36,37]. In contrast, Pr substitution in La1\u2212xPrxPt4Ge12 generates distinct changes in the multi-band nature of the superconductivity, which goes beyond this simple picture and deserves further investigations."

            "text": "We carried out electrical resistivity and X-ray diffraction experiments under hydrostatic pressures on the two skutterudite compounds, LaPt4Ge12 and PrPt4Ge12. We find a pressure-induced linear suppression of the superconduction transition temperature in both materials. Based on our XRD data, we derive a bulk modulus of 106 GPa for LaPt4Ge12 and 83 GPa for PrPt4Ge12. With the help of the bulk modulus, we established a superconducting temperature\u2013unit-cell volume phase diagram by combining the pressure data on LaPt4Ge12 and PrPt4Ge12 with results from the substitution series La1\u2212xPrxPt4Ge12. The comparison of the effect of hydrostatic pressure on LaPt4Ge12 and PrPt4Ge12 with that of chemical substitution indicates marked differences. While the weak linear dependence of Tc on the unit-cell volume with almost the same slopes for both compounds can be explained in a simple picture consistent with phonon mediated superconductivity, the nonmonotonous dependence of Tc(x) in La1\u2212xPrxPt4Ge12 suggests more complex competing behaviors in the substitution series, which stimulate further detailed investigations.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, M.N.; sample preparation R.G. and A.L.-J.; investigation, G.A.L., K.M. and W.S.; data analysis, G.A.L., K.M., R.D.d.R. and M.N.; writing\u2014original draft, M.N.; writing\u2014review & editing, G.A.L., K.M., R.G., A.L.-J., R.D.d.R., W.S. and M.N.
