Exploration of Combination Therapies: Investigating the synergistic effects of CDFHCD with current first-line treatments for PDAC, such as gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel or FOLFIRINOX, to evaluate whether CDFHCD can enhance the efficacy of these standard therapies. This research could include mechanistic studies to understand how CDFHCD interacts with these drugs at the molecular level to improve treatment outcomes.

Development of Targeted Delivery Systems: Designing targeted delivery systems for CDFHCD to further improve its accumulation in pancreatic tumors while minimizing effects on healthy tissues. This could involve the use of nanoparticles, liposomes, or polymeric micelles functionalized with targeting ligands that recognize markers specific to pancreatic cancer cells or the tumor microenvironment.

Long-Term Efficacy and Toxicity Studies: Conducting long-term animal studies to assess the efficacy and safety profile of CDFHCD over extended treatment periods. These studies would be crucial for determining the potential for chronic toxicity, the optimal dosing regimen, and the long-term impact on survival and quality of life in PDAC models.

Mechanistic Studies on CSCs and Tumor Microenvironment: Delving deeper into the mechanisms by which CDFHCD affects cancer stem cells (CSCs) and the tumor microenvironment. This could include exploring its impact on the immune landscape of tumors, its role in modulating the desmoplastic reaction, and its effects on the signaling pathways critical for CSC maintenance and function.

Clinical Trials with Biomarker Analysis: Initiating phase I/II clinical trials of CDFHCD in patients with PDAC, incorporating comprehensive biomarker analyses. These studies would aim to evaluate the clinical efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of CDFHCD in humans, as well as to identify biomarkers that can predict response to treatment. This approach could help in personalizing treatment strategies and identifying patient subgroups most likely to benefit from CDFHCD therapy.
