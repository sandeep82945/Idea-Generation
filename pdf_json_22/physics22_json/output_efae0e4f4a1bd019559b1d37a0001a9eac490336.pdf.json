It is based on a large array of TES microcalorimeters, which work in combination with a Cryogenic AntiCoincidence detector (CryoAC). This is necessary to reduce the particle background level thus enabling part of the mission science goals. Here we present the first joint test of X-IFU TES array and CryoAC Demonstration Models, performed in a FDM setup. We show that it is possible to operate properly both detectors, and we provide a preliminary demonstration of the anti-coincidence capability of the system achieved by the simultaneous detection of cosmic muons.",

            "text": "ATHENA [1] is a Large X-ray observatory (launch by ESA in 2030s), aimed at studying the Hot and Energetic Universe [2]. The X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU [3]) is its cryogenic spectrometer, able to perform simultaneously detailed imaging and high-energy resolution spectroscopy (\u0394EFWHM < 2.5\u00a0eV @ 7\u00a0keV). The core of the instrument is an array of ~ 3000 Transition Edge Sensor (TES) microcalorimeters. The TES array alone is not able to distinguish between target X-ray photons and background particles depositing energy in the detector band, seriously limiting the instrument sensitivity. This particle background is constituted by a primary component of both solar and Galactic Cosmic Rays origin, and by secondary particles generated inside the spacecraft. To deal with this issue, the Focal Plane Assembly (FPA) hosts a Cryogenic AntiCoincidence detector (CryoAC [4]). It is a TESbased detector, placed < 1\u00a0mm underneath the TES array. While X-ray photons are absorbed in the TES array, background particles deposit energy in both detectors, producing a coincidence signal that allows vetoing these unwanted events (Fig.\u00a01). The CryoAC allows to reduce the X-IFU particle background by a factor of ~ 50, reaching the scientific requirement of the mission. A detailed review of the X-IFU particle background issue can be found in Ref. [5].\nEnsuring mechanical, thermal, and electromagnetic compatibility between TES array and CryoAC is a challenge in the FPA development. In the context of the development of the X-IFU Demonstration Model (DM), we performed the first joint test of TES array and CryoAC DMs. The main goals of the activity have been to demonstrate the proper simultaneous operation of the two detectors, to evaluate the crosstalk between them, and to give a preliminary demonstration of the anticoincidence capability of the system."

The core of the setup is the detector plate, in which TES array and CryoAC DMs chips are mounted at 0.5\u00a0mm distance, in a relative position representative of the one in the X-IFU FPA (Fig.\u00a02).\nThe experiment has been integrated into the mixing chamber of a dilution refrigerator, suspended by Kevlar strands (to damp microvibrations induced by pulse tube operation), and shielded at cold by a superconducting niobium shield. The setup hosted a 55Fe source to test the TES array response at 6\u00a0keV, an active thermal control system (typical thermal stability ~ 2\u00a0\u00b5KRMS at 50\u00a0mK), and a magnetic coil to apply a magnetic field perpendicular to the TES array to optimize the working point."

            "text": "To assess the impact of CryoAC operations on the magnetic environment at TES array level, we performed magnetic field scans on TES array pixels (Fig.\u00a0 4). These measurements consist in varying the magnetic field normal to the TES array (via the setup magnetic coil) and monitoring its biased pixels baseline level. Typically, this level shows a maximum in correspondence to the optimal magnetic field value (i.e. the value that cancels the residual magnetic field at the pixel level).\nHere, we performed the magnetic field scans while operating the CryoAC at different bias currents (corresponding to different colors in Fig.\u00a0 4). The scans have not highlighted any change in the magnetic environment at TES array level induced by the CryoAC, since the parabolic shape and the maximum position remain the same for each acquired curve. Differences in the absolute signal amplitude are due to slow thermal effects related to the change of the CryoAC power dissipation. We repeated this measurement for different pixels, obtaining similar results. We can conclude that the typical CryoAC DM bias currents do not have a significant magnetic impact on the TES array.\nWe have also performed dynamic crosstalk measurements (Fig.\u00a0 5). In this case, we have injected high-energy thermal pulses on the CryoAC via its onboard heater (energy > 1\u00a0MeV, frequency: 10\u00a0Hz), and simultaneously looked at the signal on TES array blind pixels, using a trigger generated by the CryoAC via a dedicated custom electronics. Averaging the acquired signals, we have found no evidence of significant crosstalk on the TES array when the CryoAC develops a pulse, down to the level of 0.1\u00a0eV.\nThe measurement has been repeated for different pixels and CryoAC bias currents, without noticing significant crosstalk effects.\n1 3"

The observed count rate is 1.6\u00a0cts/ cm2/min, in agreement with the expectations for cosmic muons [11].\nFor all the collected events, we analyzed both the energy depositions on the CryoAC and on the TES array. The acquired spectra are shown in Fig.\u00a0 7. The spectra are consistent with the expectations for Minimum Ionizing Particles (MIPs) [12], showing Landau distribution shapes and peaking energies of ~ 7\u00a0keV for the TES array and ~ 200\u00a0keV for the CryoAC.\n1 3"

            "text": "The first joint operation between the X-IFU TES array and CryoAC Demonstration Models has been performed in a FDM setup, showing that the detectors can properly operate together. No significant magnetic coupling between them has been detected, and no crosstalk has been measured down to the level of 0.1\u00a0eV on TES array pixels.\nIn the context of the X-IFU development, we shall note that the readout technology for the TES array has been changed close to them so far discussed integrated chipset test. The baseline moved from the FDM developed at SRON, used in this work, to the Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) scheme developed at NIST [6], where pixels are DC biased. Although the FDM has recently performed big jump ahead [7], TDM has been indeed considered by the system the most mature technology for X-IFU aims. A review of these technologies and the difference in the pixel optimization used in AC and DC-biased multiplexing schemes can be found in [14].\nAbout this work, we shall note that pixels operated under AC bias (FDM) suffer a lower magnetic field sensitivity than pixels operated under DC bias (TDM). Since the TES array and CryoAC interaction are strongly related to the magnetic coupling between the detectors, the compatibility measurements here presented shall be then integrated with a new set of measurements performed in a DC-bias setup.\nThe performed tests represent anyway an important step towards the FPA development. In particular, the simultaneous detection of cosmic muons on TES array and CryoAC has provided a first demonstration of the anticoincidence capabilities of the system, representing a milestone for the X-IFU project.\nAcknowledgements This work has been supported by ASI (Italian Space Agency) through the Contracts no. 2015-046-R.0, 2018-11-HH.0, and 2019-27-HH.0, and by the ESA (European Space Agency) Core Technology Program (CTP) Contract No. 4000114932/15/NL/BW.
