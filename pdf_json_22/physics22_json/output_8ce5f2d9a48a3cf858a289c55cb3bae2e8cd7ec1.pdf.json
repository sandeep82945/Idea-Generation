    "abstractText": "We revisit the domain wall problem for QCD axion models with more than one quark charged under the Peccei-Quinn symmetry. Symmetry breaking during or after inflation results in the formation of a domain wall network which would cause cosmic catastrophe if it comes to dominate the Universe. The network may be made unstable by invoking a \u2018tilt\u2019 in the axion potential due to Planck scale suppressed non-renormalisable operators. Alternatively the random walk of the axion field during inflation can generate a \u2018bias\u2019 favouring one of the degenerate vacua, but we find that this mechanism is in practice irrelevant. Consideration of the axion abundance generated by the decay of the wall network then requires the Peccei-Quinn scale to be rather low \u2014 thus e.g. ruling out the DFSZ axion with mass below \u223c 11 meV, where most experimental searches are in fact focused.

Symmetry breaking during or after inflation results in the formation of a domain wall network which would cause cosmic catastrophe if it comes to dominate the Universe. The network may be made unstable by invoking a \u2018tilt\u2019 in the axion potential due to Planck scale suppressed non-renormalisable operators. Alternatively the random walk of the axion field during inflation can generate a \u2018bias\u2019 favouring one of the degenerate vacua, but we find that this mechanism is in practice irrelevant. Consideration of the axion abundance generated by the decay of the wall network then requires the Peccei-Quinn scale to be rather low \u2014 thus e.g. ruling out the DFSZ axion with mass below \u223c 11 meV, where most experimental searches are in fact focused.\nCopyright K.

            "text": "Despite the many successes of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics a number of important questions remain unanswered. For example stable SM matter (i.e. nucleons) accounts for only \u223c 5% of the total energy density of the universe, while \u223c 26% is in the form of dark matter (DM) [1]. While DM is likely constituted of new relic, weakly interacting particles, no experiment has yet detected its non-gravitational interactions hence its fundamental nature remains elusive.\nAn attractive candidate particle for DM motivated within the SM is the axion. This is the pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson arising from the spontaneous symmetry breaking of a chiral U(1)PQ introduced by Peccei & Quinn (PQ) [2,3] to solve the \u2018strong-C P \u2019 problem, viz. why do strong interactions not violate charge-parity symmetry, thereby generating an electric dipole moment (EDM) of the neutron which is not observed [4]. When the \u2018Weinberg-Wilczek\u2019 axion corresponding to such symmetry breaking at the electroweak scale [5,6] was not found, it was realised that the Peccei-Quinn scale fPQ can be much higher, implying an \u2018invisible axion\u2019 with very suppressed couplings to SM fields. Nevertheless such relic axions can account for the cold dark matter of the universe for fPQ \u223c 109\u221211 GeV [7\u20139] as coherent oscillations of the axion field have the same equation of state as non-relativistic particles.\nThe cosmological evolution is even more interesting because of a sequence of symmetry breaking which produces potentially stable topological defects. Below fPQ the vacuum manifold is not simply connected. This implies the existence of closed paths in physical space which get mapped onto non-trivial paths in field space winding around the origin. Such field configurations correspond to cosmic strings [10\u201312]. When the temperature drops to be of O(\u039bQCD)\u223c 300 MeV, QCD instantons generate a mass for the axion [13,14]:\nm2a (T (t)) = 1.7\u00d7 10 \u22127 \u039b4QCD\nf 2PQ\n\u039bQCD\nT\n6.7\n\u21d2 ma(T = 0)\u2243 5.7\u00b5eV 1012 GeV fPQ . (1)\nThis breaks the symmetry to Z(NDW), where NDW is the number of quarks charged under U(1)PQ [15,16]. The vacuum manifold of Z(NDW) is however disconnected which implies the existence of paths in physical space which map onto paths interpolating between two vacuum states in field space. Such paths necessarily leave the vacuum manifold and the resulting structure is a domain wall (DW).\nTopologically each string must be connected by NDW domain walls once the axion gets a mass. It has been argued that due to the surface energy of domain walls, a network of strings and domain walls with NDW = 1 would be unstable and collapse [17]. Hadronic axion models like KSVZ [18, 19] have NDW = 1, however, most models have NDW > 1, e.g. the DFSZ axion [20, 21] has NDW = 6. Wall networks with NDW > 1 are stable and can lead to cosmological catastrophe if they come to dominate the energy density of the universe after they form [15], which is inevitable because of the slower scaling of their energy density than that of radiation or matter. This happens at a time [13]:\ntdom \u2272 3\n32\u03c0GN\u03c3DW \u2243 53 s 1012 GeV fPQ , (2)\nwhere the wall tension is \u03c3DW \u2243 9ma f 2PQ \u2243 5.1 \u00d7 10 10 GeV3( fPQ/1012 GeV). This marks the latest time by which the walls must have decayed, else the universe becomes dominated by them and enters a stage of accelerated (power-law) expansion with no end [22]. In fact a much stronger bound is obtained by considering the effects of the wall decay products.\nAxions emitted by the decaying string-domain wall network must be accounted for in calculating the total relic abundance of axions, along with those from the standard misalignment\nmechanism. This provides a prediction of the mass for axions to constitute the dark matter, thereby sharpening the relevant target space for experimental searches. Most investigations of the post-inflation PQ scenario, including the contributions from axion strings, indicate the range ma \u223c 10\u22125 \u2212 10\u22123 eV [23,24]\u2014 the \u2018light axion\u2019 window. This is therefore where most experimental searches are focussed, especially those using tunable microwave cavities [25,26]. This does not however take into account the potential contribution from domain walls. Moreover such axions are born relativistic with a non-thermal spectrum, and turn non-relativistic subsequently. This is quite different from both the \u2018cold\u2019 axions from the misalignment mechanism which have the equation of state of a non-relativistic gas, and any \u2018hot\u2019 axions created in thermal equilibrium in the early universe with a relativistic Bose-Einstein spectrum. The effect of the latter two populations on the formation of structure in the universe has been investigated in detail (for a review, see [27]). However the effect of the initially relativistic but non-thermally produced axions from domain wall decay warrants further investigation.\nLattice simulations of the axion field evolution taking into account the temperature dependence of the mass and the domain wall contribution for NDW = 1 models have recently been performed [28]. However because of the large separation of scales between the thickness (\u223c m\u22121a ) and the separation (\u223c H\n\u22121) of the walls, such simulations of meta-stable DW networks are challenging. (Here H \u2261 R\u0307/R is the Hubble expansion rate, where R(t) is the scale-factor of the universe.) We show below that axion models with NDW > 1 are severely constrained without need for such studies. Henceforth we assume for simplicity NDW = 2 which yields a \u2018frustrated\u2019 stable wall network; our conclusions hold also for NDW > 2 in particular the DFSZ axion which has NDW = 6.\nThe usual argument for evading the domain wall problem is to invoke non-renormalisable Plank-scale suppressed operators reflecting the effects of quantum gravity on global symmetries. These explicitly break the U(1)PQ [29\u201331] and lift the degeneracy of the vacuum states, resulting in a pressure term which causes the true vacuum domain to grow [15] and the DW network to collapse. The co-moving domain wall energy density decays as [32]\n\u03c1DW\u221d \u03c3DW \u03b7 exp \u2212\u00b53\n\u03b7\n\u03b7DW\n3\n, (3)\nwhere \u00b5 is the fractional energy difference between the potential minima, \u03b7 = \u222b\ndt/R(t) is the conformal time and \u03b7DW is its value when the walls form. Such explicit breaking of U(1)PQ is experimentally constrained as it reintroduces the C P violation which is required by the upper limit on the neutron EDM [33, 34] to be negligibly small. Requiring axion domain walls to disappear in time to avoid cosmological catastrophe thus implies a lower bound on the neutron EDM. Consequently the tilt solution to the domain wall problem is falsifiable by improved experiments.\nWe also consider an alternative mechanism to render domain walls unstable by introducing a statistical bias in the population of the vacuum states. Such a bias leads, for Z(2) models, to exponential decay of the co-moving domain wall energy density [32,35\u201337]:\n\u03c1DW\u221d \u03c3DW \u03b7 exp \u2212\u03f52\n\u03b7\n\u03b7DW\n3\n, (4)\nwith \u03f5 the bias and \u03b7DW the conformal time when the walls form. This mechanism was proposed as a generic solution to the domain wall problem for weakly coupled fields [38]. Such bias may be generated by the dynamics of the axion field during inflation (although this has been recently disputed taking super-horizon correlations into account [39]). The random walk of the axion field during an extended inflationary epoch has been exploited to open up previously excluded axion parameter space [40,41].\nThis paper is organised as follows. We begin by reviewing (\u00a7 2) the two solutions above to the domain wall problem and highlight the challenges. In particular the bias solution turns out to be irrelevant. Although the tilt solution does work, in \u00a7 3 we show that the overproduction of axions from the collapsing string-wall network effectively excludes it for most of the parameter space that axion dark matter searches are presently focussed on.1 Experiments looking for heavier QCD axions [43\u201346] thus receive further motivation from this work. However the relevant parameter space for hadronic axion models e.g. KSVZ [47] is unaffected as no domain walls then survive from the early universe. Our arguments do not apply when Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking occurs before the onset of inflation."

            "text": "Proposed by Sikivie [15], the standard solution to the domain wall problem lifts the topological protection of the domain walls by introducing a tilt in the potential. Therefore only one true vacuum state remains and bubbles of false vacuum eventually collapse under the pressure stemming from the increased volume energy density within the bubbles of false vacuum. The explicit breaking of the global symmetry is due to quantum gravity effects at the scale MQG parameterised by non-renormalisable operators [29\u201331]:\n\u03b4VMQG = |g| ei\u03b4\nM2m+n\u22124QG |\u03c6|2m\u03c6n + h.c.+ c , (5)\nwhere the constant c is chosen to have min V = 0. The coupling can in general be complex introducing a phase \u03b4 with coupling strength |g|. The above term stems from a 2m+ n-dim operator with a U(1)PQ charge n; under U(1)PQ the |\u03c6|\n2m stays invariant and \u03c6n changes by n. The operator is suppressed by M2m+n\u22124QG and we make the most conservative choice that MQG is the Planck Scale MPl \u2261 G \u22121/2 N \u2243 1.2\u00d710\n19 GeV. If it were lower, e.g. at the string scale, this would only strengthen the bounds quoted in this paper.\nAfter U(1)PQ spontaneously breaks and the complex PQ field acquires a vev va = NDW fPQ, the potential (5) can be written as\n\u03b4VMPl = |g|M 2 Pl fPQp 2MPl\n2m+n\u22122\nf 2PQ (1\u2212 cos (na+\u03b4)) , (6)\nyielding a potential for the axion field below the QCD scale:\nV (a) = m2a f 2 PQ [(1\u2212 cos(NDWa)) +\u00b5 (1\u2212 cos (na+\u03b4))] , (7)\nwith\n\u00b5\u2261 |g| MPl ma\n2\nfPQp 2MPl\n2m+n\u22122\n. (8)\nIf \u03b4, |g|, n and NDW are not fine-tuned such that the potentials align perfectly, there will be only one true vacuum state.\nSuch additional operators are however constrained since explicit breaking of U(1)PQ reintroduces the original strong-C P problem [15]. This \u2018axion quality problem\u2019 is quantified as\n1A similar argument has been made earlier [42] but the constraint we quote is significantly stronger.\nbelow. The vev of the new potential (which corresponds to the QCD \u2018theta parameter\u2019) is:\n\u2329\u03b8 \u232a= |g|M2Pl fPQp 2MPl\n2m+n\u22122 n\nNDW sin\u03b4\nm2a + |g|M 2 Pl fPQp 2MPl\n2m+n\u22122 n2 cos\u03b4\n\u2243 |g| MPl ma\n2\nfPQp 2MPl\n2m+n\u22122 n\nNDW sin\u03b4 , (9)\nwhere we have used the fact that the potential generated by the non-renormalisable operators is much smaller than the QCD potential. It is also natural to assume \u03b4 \u223cO(1). Requiring that the above vev respect the conservative bound \u2329\u03b8 \u232a< 10\u221210 set by the experimental upper limit on the neutron EDM, we get:\n|g| fPQp 2MPl\n2m+n n\nNDW < 1.6\u00d7 10\u221291 , (10)\ntaking |g| too be of O(1) and using relation(1) between ma and fPQ for the QCD axion. A lower bound on the tilt comes from requiring it to solve the domain wall problem. After the appearance of the domain wall network, it takes only a short while before its energy density comes to dominate the universe. The explicit breaking from the potential (6) must be large enough for the network to collapse before this happens. A conservative upper bound on the collapse time is the epoch of Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) at tBBN \u223c 1 s [48]. Having a small explicit breaking lifts the degeneracy of the NDW vacuum states leaving only one true vacuum and NDW \u2212 1 false ones. A bubble of false vacuum surrounded by the true vacuum experiences a pressure due to the difference in energy density, causing the bubble to shrink. The domain wall contributes\nEDW = \u03c3DWR2 , (11)\nfor a bubble of size R, while the energy density of the contained volume is\nEvol = \u03b4VR3 . (12)\nThe work done by the energy difference between the volume of false vacuum and the true vacuum at V = 0 is\u2206E \u223c \u03b4VR3. Then we may find the force acting on the wall, FDW = \u03b4VR2 and hence its acceleration:\n|a\u20d7|= \u03b4V \u03c3DW \u2243 2.8\u00d7 1058 GeV |g| fPQp 2MPl\n2m+n\u22121\n, (13)\nwhere we estimated the potential difference \u03b4V to be the maximum of the potential generated by non-renormalisable operators. The true difference will be slightly smaller but this does not greatly affect our argument. We can estimate the time of collapse to be roughly when the acceleration is high enough for the wall to have a velocity close to the speed of light, thereby overcoming the expansion of space and leading to collapse. This leads to the requirement:\n|g| fPQp 2MPl\n2m+n\u22121\n> 1.2\u00d7 10\u221283 . (14)\nThe two inequalities (10) and (14) result in a constraint on the Planck scale suppressed, non-renormalisable operators required to solve the axion DW problem, while leaving the PQ solution to the strong-C P problem unspoilt. Such a theory must obey\n8.5\u00d7 10\u221291 fPQ 1012 GeV < |g| fPQp 2MPl\n2m+n\n< 1.6\u00d7 10\u221291 NDW\nn , (15)\nwhich implies:\nfPQ < 1.9\u00d7 1011 GeV NDW\nn . (16)\nThe operator dimension must thus be bounded as:\nlog 1.6\u00d7 10\u221291NDW/n \u2212 log (|g|)\nlog fPQ/ p 2MPl < 2m+ n< 1+\nlog 1.2\u00d7 10\u221283 \u2212 log (|g|)\nlog fPQ/ p 2MPl . (17)\nFigure 1 shows that whereas there do exist operators for which both the aforementioned problems are solved, the solution is very unnatural. To leave the PQ solution to the strong-C P problem unspoiled we must suppress lower order operators. However, in order to have fast enough domain wall decay we must guarantee that the lowest dimensional operator which is allowed within the PQ solution does exist. We are therefore tasked with having to explain how to suppress all Planck scale suppressed operators up to the specific one we require. We conclude that explicitly breaking U(1)PQ to get around the DW problem is inherently unsatisfactory; improvement in neutron EDM measurements will tighten the constraints further, eventually closing off this possibility altogether.\nIt should also be noted that 2m+n is an integer number which reduces the available range for fPQ even further, e.g. 2m+ n = 9 requires fPQ \u223c 109 GeV for tilt to solve the DW problem while not spoiling the solution to the strong-C P problem."

            "heading": "2.2 Bias",
            "text": "Another possibility to solve the DW problem is to introduce a statistical bias in the distribution of the axion field. Generating an overpopulation in one of the NDW vacuum states eventually\nleads to domination by it. When the patches of the other vacua become causally connected, the tension of the domain walls makes them collapse. This was demonstrated for a Z(2) symmetric potential [32,35\u201337].2\nAny field lighter than the Hubble parameter in an inflationary deSitter background, i.e. with ma \u226a Hinfl, experiences quantum fluctuations of O(Hinfl). These fluctuations are caused by the exit of modes from the inflationary event horizon [49, 50]; each mode gives the field averaged over super-horizon scales a kick of order Hinfl, while the potential causes the field to settle into the vacuum states. The interplay between these two effects is critical for a bias to appear and therefore this mechanism works only for fields which experience a potential during inflation. For details on the generation of a bias, see Appendix A.\nThe issue with this solution to the axion DW problem lies in the huge separation of the two relevant scales. The size of the field space of the axion is set by its vev fPQ, while the step-size of the random walk the field undergoes during inflation is \u223c Hinfl. This leads to three distinct possibilities:\n\u2022 Hinfl \u226b fPQ: In this case, the deSitter temperature TdeS\u221d Hinfl is higher than the symmetry breaking scale of the U(1)PQ and quantum fluctuations move the field back to the origin of the potential. Thus the quantum fluctuations prevent the axion field from becoming classical and no bias is generated.\n\u2022 Hinfl \u223c fPQ: As long as Hinfl is smaller than fPQ, the PQ symmetry is broken during inflation. However, this is supposedly excluded by constraints on isocurvature perturbations [13, 51]. Additionally, the PQ scale is much higher than the QCD scale, which means that the axion does not acquire a potential from QCD instantons. Since a potential is necessary for the generation of a statistical bias, this parameter space is unsuitable for solving the domain wall problem via bias.\n\u2022 Hinfl \u226a fPQ: The hierarchy between the scales allows the PQ symmetry to be broken and the axion to develop a potential during inflation. The random walk step-size is however small and the steady state of the distribution is reached after \u223c ( fPQ/Hinfl)2\ne-folds, however the mean value of the axion field has still not changed much from its initial value. To generate a bias we must wait until the mean value accumulates around the vacuum states; this can take a long time during which the causally connected patches at the time of PQ symmetry breaking inflate and any domain walls that form are exponentially large [52]. Hence this is the same as pre-inflationary PQ symmetry breaking.\nTo circumvent the problem with an inflationary Hubble parameter which is too high to allow quark confinement and the generation of an axion potential, one may consider a potential for the axion stemming from another source. Such a possibility involving a dark gauge sector which also breaks the U(1)PQ has been proposed [53, 54]. The bias mechanism would still result in the accumulation of the axion field at the minima of this potential which would carry over to the time of QCD confinement because the axion field is weakly coupled. This would solve the domain wall problem unless the two potentials are correlated and overlap. If such a potential is generated early on in the deSitter universe, the axion field is correlated on super-horizon scales after reheating and the subsequent PQ breaking does not result in the generation of domain walls within our particle horizon. In this sense the scenario mimics the\n2However, if the walls are connected by strings, the biased initial conditions mean that the initial string configuration is energetically disfavoured and would likely relax to an unbiased state by emitting axions before the formation of DWs. Moreover recent lattice simulations show that taking superhorizon inflationary correlations into account can undermine the bias mechanism [39]. In any case we find here that bias does not solve the axion DW problem.\npre-inflationary PQ breaking scenario. Should the potential be generated at the end of inflation with a Hubble parameter large enough to result in a steady state distribution, then the subsequent domain walls are biased and decay, unless more than one minimum of the two potentials overlaps. Note however, that the two scales fPQ and Hinfl must be closely aligned to achieve this goal."

(47)\nA far more substantial contribution is made however by the radiated axions which contribute to the dark matter abundance today. Requiring that the total axion abundance not exceed the latter, we obtain the severe constraint:\nlim t\u2192t0 \u2126DWa < 0.26xa \u21d2 fPQ \u2272 3.3\u00d7 10 8 x6/7a GeV i.e. ma \u2273 17 x \u22126/7 a meV . (48)\nOur bound is consistent with previous numerical work [42, 58]. Figure 3 shows how this constraint scales with the tilt parameter \u00b5 \u2248 \u2329\u03b8 \u232a (see eq.45). As the experimental limit on the neutron EDM improves, the smaller the tilt allowed, so the above constraint on the QCD axion will tighten even further with forthcoming measurements. We also show the scaling of the bound with NDW in Figure 4. For the DFSZ model in particular NDW = 6 so the bound is ma \u2273 11 x\u22126/7a meV i.e. fPQ \u2272 5.4\u00d7 10\n8 x6/7a GeV. The above constraint used the conservative value xa = 1, i.e. the dark matter is taken to be entirely constituted of non-relativistic axions which were born relativistic but out of thermal equilibrium. Considerations of structure formation place constraints on axion \u2018hot dark matter\u2019 assuming the axions initially have a Bose-Einstein distribution [61,62]. Solution\nof the relevant Boltzmann equations governing decoupling yields the actual distribution; this imposes a restrictive upper bound ma < 0.24 eV [63]. The relevant QCD (DFSZ) axion window is then \u223c 11\u2212240 meV although this will narrow further if xa can be constrained to be below unity from considerations of structure formation. Whereas axions of such mass are subject to constraints on stellar energy loss [64], the most stringent such bound from SN 1987a is significantly weakened taking astrophysical uncertainties into account [65]. In fact there are indications of anomalous stellar cooling which would indicate a mass of O(10) meV for the QCD axion [66]."

            "text": "We have revisited the cosmological domain wall problem which poses a serious threat to the QCD axion. If the Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaks after inflation, then in any model with NDW > 1 quarks charged under U(1)PQ, a network of domain walls is created and comes to dominate over both radiation and matter. Such an universe undergoes power-law inflation without end, incompatible with the universe we observe today.\nFinding a mechanism which can make the walls collapse is challenging. A statistical bias induced by inflation in the population of the vacuum states results in exponential decay of the wall network, however, the vast separation of the relevant scales in the field space \u2014 fPQ, Hinfl,\nand \u039bQCD \u2014 means that the necessary bias cannot be generated. The other known way to make the wall network decay is to introduce a small tilt in the potential. However thus explicitly breaking the symmetry leads to the reappearance of the strong-C P problem, hence the tilt is limited by the experimental upper limit on the neutron EDM. If the tilt results, as is usually assumed, from a non-renormalisable, Planck scale suppressed operator reflecting violation of the global U(1)PQ symmetry by quantum gravity effects, then its dimension is tightly constrained. As measurements of the neutron EDM improve further, this window will eventually close altogether.\nIndependent of the mechanism, the energy density in the domain walls is released as gravitational waves and relativistic axions which subsequently turn non-relativistic, both of which are constrained by observations. We find that QCD axion models with NDW > 1 and postinflationary Peccei-Quinn breaking are severely constrained, e.g. for the DFSZ axion with NDW = 6, we require fPQ \u2272 5.4\u00d7108 GeV, i.e. ma \u2273 11 meV. Experimental searches must thus focus on higher mass axions which are cosmologically still viable, and can have noticeable effects on stellar energy loss."

This implies an exponential growth of the scale factor R(t)\u221d exp (Hinfl t) and the metric is approximately of the deSitter form\nds2 = R(t)\u03b7i, jdx idx j , (A.1)\nwith \u03b7 the flat Minkowski metric The dynamics of the axion field \u03c6(x) \u2208\n0,2\u03c0 fPQ is governed by the semi-classical equation of motion (EOM)\n\u2202\n\u2202 t\n2\n+ 3Hinfl \u2202\n\u2202 t \u2212 1 a(t)2 \u22072 \u03c6(x) + V \u2032(\u03c6(x)) = 0 , (A.2)\nwith potential\nV (\u03c6(x)) = m2a f 2 PQ 1\u2212 cos N \u03c6(x) fPQ\n. (A.3)\nThe mass term in the potential is time-dependent and has been calculated on the lattice [13] \u2014 see Eq.(1).\nDuring deSitter expansion, fields have two naturally separated scales, sub- and superhorizon, with physical momentum k > H\u22121infl and k < H \u22121 infl respectively. While the field is frozen on super-horizon scales, on sub-horizon scales it evolves according to eq. (A.2). Sub-horizon scales are said to \u2018exit the horizon\u2019 when their physical momenta k = p/R(t) are sufficiently redshifted by the expansion. Following Refs. [49,50]we write the axion field as a mode expansion for sub-horizon modes, and for super-horizon modes a coarse-grained fluctuation field \u03c7, averaged over many horizon sizes \u03c7\u0304:\n\u03c6(x) =\n\u222b\n\u0398 p\u2212 \u03f5HinfleHinfl t a\u0302p\u03c6p(t)e ip\u00b7x + h.c. +\u03c7(x)\u2212 \u03c7\u0304 . (A.4)\nThe fluctuation field obeys a Langevin-type equation\n\u2202 \u03c6 \u2202 t = 1 3Hinfl \u22072\u03c6 e2Hinfl t \u2212 \u2202 V \u2202 \u03c6 +\u03b7(x) , (A.5)\nwith \u03b7(x, t) acting as white noise sourced by the modes leaving the horizon, which causes the averaged field to random walk. The Langevin equation can be translated into a Fokker-Planck equation for the normalised probability distribution of the field P(\u03c7, \u03c7\u0304, t):\n\u2202 P(\u03c7, \u03c7\u0304, t) \u2202 t = \u2202 \u2202 \u03c7 1 3Hinfl \u2202 V \u2202 \u03c7 P(\u03c7, \u03c7\u0304, t) + H3infl 8\u03c02 \u2202 2P(\u03c7, \u03c7\u0304, t) \u2202 \u03c72 .

(A.9)\nThe distribution (A.7) evolves towards the stationary solution for late times and thus for the average field\nPstationary(\u03c7\u0304) = exp\n\u2212 4\u03c02\n3H4infl V (\u03c7\u0304) /\n\u222b\nexp \u2212 4\u03c02\n3H4infl V (\u03c7) d\u03c7 . (A.10)\nFor the axion potential (A.3), Eq.(A.8) reduces to a Schr\u00f6dinger type equation after neglecting terms of O(ma/Hinfl)4:\n\u2202 2\u03a6n \u2202 \u03c72 + 4\u03c02 3 N2m2a H4infl cos N \u03c7 fPQ + 8\u03c02\u039bn H3infl \u03a6n . (A.11)\nThe solution is a Mathieu function:\nMC 32\u03c02 f 2PQ N2H3infl \u039bn, 8\u03c02 f 2PQm 2 a 3H4infl , N \u03c7 2 fPQ \u2248 cos\n\n\n\u221a \u221a \u221a\n8\u03c02 f 2PQ H3infl \u039bn \u03c7 fPQ\n\n , (A.12)\nwhere we have used ma\u226a fPQ, Hinfl in the last step. The eigenvalues are then given by\n\u039bn \u2248 n2\n8\u03c02 Hinfl fPQ\n2\nHinfl , (A.13)\nand the first correction to the stationary solution (A.10) is exponentially suppressed when the number of e-folds exceeds 8\u03c02( fPQ/Hinfl)2. Thus, the smaller the inflationary scale, the longer it takes to reach the stationary state.\nAssuming the potential admits slow-roll, the solution for the fluctuation field can be written as a Gaussian wrapped around the compact field region:\nP(\u03c7, \u03c7\u0304, t) = \u221e \u2211\nk=\u2212\u221e\n\u221a \u221a \u221a 2\u03c0\nH3infl t exp\n\u2212 2\u03c02\nH3infl t\n\u03c7 \u2212 \u03c7\u0304 + 2\u03c0 fPQk 2\n= 1\n2\u03c0 \u03d1 \u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8\u0304 2 , exp\n\u2212 H3infl t\n16\u03c03 f 2PQ\n, (A.14)\nwith \u03d1 the Jacobi theta function and \u03b8 = \u03c7/ fPQ. Physically, two effects are competing here. On the one hand, each mode leaving the horizon gives the distribution a kick of O(Hinfl/2\u03c0), thus widening the distribution. On the other hand, the potential causes the average to concentrate around the vacuum states V (\u03c7) = 0. This concentration near the potential minima will lead to the appearance of a statistical bias in the population of the states, hence it is clear that our scenario only works when the axion develops a potential during inflation.\nA.2 FLRW universe and bias generation\nAfter cosmic inflation and reheating the universe enters a period of radiation-dominated Friedman-Lema\u00eetre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) expansion with a metric similar to eq.(A.1) but with H(t) = 1/2t no longer constant and R(t) \u221d p t. Accelerated expansion has stopped\nso the causal horizon starts growing which leads to the re-entry of scales which had left the horizon in the deSitter phase. The equation of motion changes to\n\u2202\n\u2202 t\n2\n+ 3H(t) \u2202\n\u2202 t\n\u03c6(x) + V \u2032(\u03c6(x)) = 0 , (A.15)\nwhere we have neglected the spatial derivatives (smoothed out during the inflationary epoch). The initial conditions are given by the inflationary Hubble parameter 1/2t i = Hinfl and the field at the end of inflation \u03c6i = \u03c7(t i); note that \u2202t\u03c6i = 0 because of inflation. The Hubble drag term decreases until the potential dominates the field evolution. At this point \u03c6(x) settles into one of the potential minima.\nThe bias \u03f5 is defined as the difference in the probability of populating the degenerate minima. Qualitatively the bias arises because the averaged distribution during inflation (eq.A.10) is concentrated around the potential minima and the fluctuation field distribution (eq.A.14) has a finite width, making it less probable to populate vacuum states further away from the average field value. For the simplest case NDW = 2 we follow the definition [38]:\nb(\u03c7\u0304) =\n\u222b\nf (\u03c6i)P(\u03c6i , \u03c7\u0304, t i)d\u03c6i , (A.16)\nwith f (\u03c6) a function taking the values \u22121,1 when the evolution of \u03c6 ends in one or the other vacuum state respectively. Inflation gives access only to the probability distribution of \u03c7\u0304, hence this translates into a probability of finding a bias [38]:\nP(|b|< x) = \u2211\n\u03c7\u0304; b=b(\u03c7\u0304)\n\u222b b(\u03c7\u0304)=x\nb(\u03c7\u0304)=\u2212x Pstationary(\u03c7\u0304)d\u03c7\u0304 . (A.17)\nOnce the bias is established the domain wall network becomes unstable and its energy density exponentially drops according to eq.(4). The energy density from the collapsing network is radiated as axions and gravitational waves.\nThe width of the distribution (A.14),\u03c3 = q H3infl t/4\u03c0 2 f 2PQ, is dictated by the ratio Hinfl/ fPQ. For Hinfl \u226b fPQ the distribution is flat over the field range \u03b8 \u2208 [\u2212\u03c0,\u03c0] but when Hinfl \u226a fPQ, the wrapped normal distribution can be approximated by a Gaussian.\nA.3 Narrow Gaussian (Hinfl\u226a fPQ)\nWhen Hinfl \u226a fPQ, the distribution is well approximated by a narrow Gaussian as long as the central value \u03b8\u0304 is far from\u2212\u03c0,\u03c0. Due to the symmetries of the potential (A.3) the bias function (A.16) is symmetric around the origin and anti-symmetric around the points \u03b8 = \u00b1\u03c0/2. It is thus sufficient to concentrate on a subset of the field range given by [0,\u03c0/2] and the entire function can be reconstructed as\nb(\u03c7\u0304) = \u03b4k,0\n\n \n \n\u222b \u03c0 \u03c0 2 P \u03b8 , \u03b8\u0304 , t d\u03b8 \u2212 \u222b \u03c0 2 \u2212\u03c02 P \u03b8 , \u03b8\u0304 , t d\u03b8 , \u03b8\u0304 \u2208 0, \u03c02 , \u2212b \u03c0\u2212 \u03b8\u0304 , \u03b8\u0304 \u2208\n\u03c0 2 ,\u03c0 ,\nb \u2212\u03b8\u0304 , \u03b8\u0304 \u2208 [\u2212\u03c0, 0) .\n(A.18)\nHere we have used the fact that for a finite potential like eq.(A.3) which allows free states, the fact that inflation dilutes the derivatives implies that after inflation the field simply settles into the vacuum state it started above. Thus, the function f (\u03c6) is \u22121 when \u03c6 \u2208 [\u2212\u03c0/2,\u03c0/2) and +1 otherwise.\nBecause of the symmetries, the sum in Eq.(A.17) yields 2 so the probability is:\nP(|b|< \u03f5) = 4 \u222b b(\u03b8\u0304 )=\u03f5\n\u03c0/2\nPstationary(\u03b8\u0304 )d\u03b8\u0304 , (A.19)\nwhere the upper integration limit requires inverting Eq.(A.18). By definition, P(|b| < 1) = 1 hence the probability rises at high values of b. Also by definition P(|b|< 0) = 0. The behaviour in between interpolates between these two extremes. Increasing Hinfl increases the width of the Gaussian distribution (A.14) and yields smaller values of the bias. This is easily understood since the bias comes from counting the positions of the central value \u03b8\u0304 , weighted with the distribution (A.10). The narrower the Gaussian, the more likely it is to fall into just one or the other vacuum.\nThe width increases with time hence after a sufficient number of e-folds of inflation the distribution spreads to cover multiple vacuum states. However, since the step-size of the random walk is set by Hinfl while the field range is set by fPQ, the required number of e-folds is enormous, \u221d ( fPQ/Hinfl)2 \u226b 1. The causally connected regions of the universe are inflated to much larger scales than the observable universe today and no domain wall problem arises. The situation is thus equivalent to pre-inflationary PQ breaking.\nA.4 Wide Gaussian (Hinfl\u226b fPQ)\nIn the opposite limit, the distribution is well approximated as flat over the field range, with only small perturbations:\nP(\u03b8 , \u03b8\u0304 , t)\u2243 1\n2\u03c0\n1+ 2 cos \u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8\u0304 exp \u2212 \u03c32\n2\n. (A.20)\nWith the same definition of the function f (\u03c6), the bias can be found analytically:\nb(\u03b8\u0304 )\u2243 \u2212 4 \u03c0 exp \u2212 \u03c32 2 cos \u03b8\u0304 . (A.21)\nInverting this equation gives the central frequency as a function of the bias \u03b8\u0304 (b) and hence the upper integration limit for the bias probability (A.19):\nP(|b|< \u03f5) = 4 \u222b cos\u22121(\u2212(\u03c0/4)\u03f5 exp[\u03c32/2])\n\u03c0/2\nPstationary(\u03b8\u0304 )d\u03b8\u0304 . (A.22)\nThe general behaviour is similar to the narrow Gaussian case, however the probability for a smaller bias is significantly larger for a flat distribution, as might be expected.\nThe above argument assumes that the axion field is classical and has a potential such that the mean value can accumulate around the vacuum states. However when Hinfl\u226a fPQ this is not the case. Quantum fluctuations in the deSitter background are of O(Hi) and drive the PQ field back to the origin, restoring U(1)PQ. In this sense, the Peccei-Quinn symmetry is never broken during inflation, there is no axion potential, and therefore, no bias is generated."
