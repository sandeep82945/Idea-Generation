    "abstractText": "Obesity is characterized by an excessive and abnormal accumulation of fat. According to the 2022 National Health and Nutrition Survey, in Mexico, the prevalence of overweight and obesity\u2014diagnosed if one\u2019s body mass index (BMI) was \u226525 kg/m2\u2014in adults was 75.2%. A strong association between the amount of visceral fat and diseases such as diabetes mellitus type II has been recognized. Species of the Bauhinia genus have lipid-lowering and antidiabetic properties. The aim of this work was to evaluate the lipolytic and antiadipogenic activity of Bauhinia divaricata L. in 3T3-L1 cells and to identify the major compounds in the bioactive treatments. The extraction of aerial parts allowed us to obtain hexanic (BdHex), ethyl acetate (BdEAc), and hydroalcoholic (BdHA) extracts. Lipid levels were measured in 3T3-L1 cells differentiated into adipocytes. Our evaluation of cell viability identified an IC50 > 1000 \u03bcg/mL in all the extracts, and our evaluation of the antiadipogenic activity indicated that there was a significant reduction (p < 0.001) in the accumulation of lipids with hydroalcoholic (60%) and ethyl acetate (75%) extracts of B. divaricate compared with metformin at 30 mM (65%). The major compounds identified in these extracts were as follows: triacetin (1), 2,3-dihydroxypropyl acetate (2), (3E)-2-methyl-4-(1,3,3trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]hept-2-yl)-3-buten-2-ol (3), 2,5-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (4), (3R)-3hydroxydodecanoic acid (5), kaempferol-3-O-rhamnoside (6), and quercetin 3-O-rhamnoside (7). Some of these naturally occurring compounds have been related to the anti-obesity effects of other medicinal plants; therefore, these compounds isolated from B. divaricata could be responsible for inhibiting the differentiation process from preadipocytes to mature adipocytes.",

            "text": "The prevalence of obesity has grown exponentially over the last two decades, and it has been labeled a pandemic-like problem. Currently, its prevalence continues to increase, and patients suffering from this illness are at risk of developing chronic diseases [1]. Mexico and the United States occupy the tops places in terms of the prevalence of obesity among adults. Particularly, in Mexico, in the year 2018, 75.2% of the population was found to be overweight or obese; of those with obesity, more than 75% had abdominal obesity, which is related to the development of chronic pathologies in adults such as type II diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure, and cancer. In 2021, the prevalence of overweight and obesity (BMI \u2265 25 kg/m2) was 75.0% in women and 69.6% in men [2\u20134]. There is a strong association between abdominal fat and cardiovascular and metabolic disease. This same association, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), increases the risk associated with health to a severe level when the individual\u2019s BMI is higher [5]. In addition to the risks mentioned above, there is also a high risk of death,\nPlants 2023, 12, 3799. https://doi.org/10.3390/plants12223799 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/plants\nPlants 2023, 12, 3799 2 of 15\nwhich is why, in recent years, studies on obesity and the mechanisms that are involved in its development have gained important relevance [6]. The WHO has classified obesity as the epidemic of the 21st century; genetic and environmental factors determine this metabolic disorder, which is characterized by an excessive accumulation of body fat above the expected amount [7]. The accumulation of fat in the abdominal region or central obesity is of special interest, considering the measurement taken on the iliac crest is \u2265102 cm in men and \u226588 cm in women since obesity is directly related to the risk of presenting cardiovascular, metabolic complications, and insulin resistance [8,9]. Said fatty tissue alters its function qualitatively and quantitatively in its capacity to store fat, and inflammation of the same tissue linked to metabolic disorders can occur [10]. The treatment of obesity is multidisciplinary and involves the use of drugs such as phentermine, topiramate, and orlistat, among others, all of which have adverse effects on the consumer [11,12]. The use of plant species for weight control has also been reported, and species with a history of lipid and blood glucose control can be sourced from the genus Bauhinia. Among the most outstanding species of the Bauhinia genus is B. divaricata L., which is one of the most common species found in the Yucatan Peninsula and is recognized as one of the five wild species of the native representative Cercideae tribe [13,14]; it can also be found in other states of Mexico [15]. B. divaricata has an ethnomedical history of being used as a lipid-lowering, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and anticoagulant treatment for diabetes. Studies focusing on the species B. divaricata have reported on its glycolipids, glycosylsteroids, lactones, quinines, tannins, and terpenoids [16,17]. Due to the lack of specific studies for the treatment of obesity using the Bauhinia species, the objective of this work was to evaluate the antiadipogenic activity of B. divaricata in an in vitro model of obesity."

In the UV light spectrum, the compound showed a \u03bbmax 262 and 343.4 nm, which is characteristic of a flavonol. The 1H NMR spectra showed two systems: an aromatic AB system, [\u03b4 6.21 (1H, d, 1.9 Hz, H-6) and 6.38 (1H, d, 1.9 Hz, H-8)], that signals other aromatic ABA\u2019B\u2019 systems, such as [\u03b4 7.78 (1H, d, 8.7 Hz, H-2\u2032, H-6\u2032), and 6.95 (1H, d, 8.7 Hz, H-3\u2032 and H-5\u2032)], which indicates a flavonol nucleus called kaempferol. One anomeric proton at \u03b4 5.39 (1H, d, 1.4) was assigned to H-1\u2032\u2032 correlates in COSY with a signal at \u03b4 4.23 (1H, dd, 1.4, 3.3), which was assigned to H-2\u2032\u2032. Regarding the sugar portion, the evaluation of spin\u2013spin coupling, and chemical changes enabled the identification of Rhamnopyranose as a sugar residue. The position of sugar\nPlants 2023, 12, 3799 7 of 15\nwith kaempferol was unambiguously defined at C-3(\u03b4 134.7) with the long-range correlation (HMBC) with the proton of H-1\u2032\u2032 at (\u03b4 5.3, d, 1.4 Hz) kaempferol-3-O-rhamnoside (6).

Discussion Among the different species of the Bauhinia genus, it has been reported that the\nleaves and flowers of the Bauhinia forficata subsp. prurinosa are used in countries like Chile in the form of an infusion for glycemic control and that they have pharmacological effects [21]. For the present work, B. divaricata (aerial parts) was selected because reports have shown that this species has a high content of secondary metabolites and it was possible to identify that the aqueous extract of the leaves shows hypoglycemic activity. The Bauhinia genus is known in different Latin American countries and has been especially studied in Brazil, where it was used to treat infections, pain, and diabetes [22].\nPrevious work carried out by Herrera-Ruiz et al. (2019) led to the obtention of a hydroalcoholic extract of Bauhinia blakeana with a yield of 7.8%, which is similar to our results of a yield of 7.30% in the hydroalcoholic extract of B. divaricata [23].\nIn the evaluation of the effect produced by the hydroalcoholic extract of B. divaricata on the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells, it was possible to identify the induction of a remarkable morphological change that manifests itself from the third day, mainly in its size and taking a shape, frank round on day 9 of differentiation. The cells lost the typical stellate morphology of the fibroblast and became multiple lipid spheres that also increased in size as the differentiation process progressed. Clavijo et al. previously reported the same for the 3T3-L1 cell line (2007) [24].\nRegarding the evaluation of viability, the results of this work show that the extracts from B. divaricata did not present a cytotoxic effect on the 3T3-L1 cell line. However, there are studies, such as that of Sharma et al. (2019) [25], wherein the methanolic extract of Bauhinia variegata L. bark showed a cytotoxic effect on glioma C-6 cell lines, MCF-7 breast cancer cells, and colon cancer cells. HCT-15. Similarly, Bauhinia purpurea was shown to have cytotoxic activity in the KB and BC cell lines, with which it reached an IC50 of 10.5 to 72.3 \u00b5M [26].\nStudying the extracts in the in vitro model made it possible to identify the extracts with the highest activity among the above and select one of them to carry out chemical separation to identify the major compounds in the bioactive treatments. The ethyl acetate extract of the species B. divaricata was subjected to chemical separation tests, and from these tests, it was possible to obtain 118 fractions, which were collected in four treatments (I, II, III, and IV), of which the one with the highest activity was treatment III. In fraction TIII-8, the compound triacetin was identified, and in TIIIB-20, the compound identified was kaempferol-3-O-rhamnoside. As far as triacetin is concerned, there is no history of it being identified in the species, and it has only been used as a food additive. Regarding kaempferol-3-O-rhamnoside, in 2015, it was reported in the species Bauhinia malab\u00e1rica in a study carried out in Egypt as afzelin, as well as in the compilation of different species of the genus Bauhinia, among which was Bauhinia variegate, which was reported to have a molecular weight of 431.09 g/mol.

These results are similar to what was identified in this study, where ultra-high resolution chromatography and masses of molecular weight were used to identify kaempferol-3-O-rhamnoside with a molecular weight of 433.12 g/mol [27]. Kaempferol-3-O-rhamnoside belongs to the most abundant group of chemical compounds in the Bauhinia genus. The kaempferol-3-O-rhamnoside found in the Schima wallichii Korth species native to Asia has shown that it manages to reduce lipid peroxidation, which is related to obesity if the patient has a higher than usual body mass index (determined by the amount of abdominal fat that the adipocyte, which is compressed within the abdomen), is capable of releasing, a greater amount of reactive oxygen species and proinflammatory cytokines, and a condition for the development of lipid peroxidation [28]. In a study carried out with quercetin 3-O-rhamnoside, its activity as an inhibitor of lipid peroxidation in 3T3-L1 cells of the same cell type used in our work was recognized [29]. This could indicate that the effect observed in the quantification of total lipids is related to the antioxidant effect of the polyphenolic compounds between others. 2,5-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (4) has a history of identification in Entada phaseoloides (L.), a medicinal species used in China to treat problems of hemostasis and detoxification and as a treatment for diabetes mellitus. It is also anti-inflammatory and has recently been found to have anti-HIV activity [30]. In addition, it is important to highlight that several Bauhinia species are native to Mexico, and it is possible to find them in abundance in different states of Mexico [31]. This is extremely important due to the obesity problems that this country suffers from.\nPlants 2023, 12, 3799 11 of 15"

The effect of extracts and chromatographic fractions from Bauhinia divaricata L. was evident in this pharmacological model, and the major compounds in the most active treat-\nPlants 2023, 12, 3799 14 of 15\nments could be responsible for the antiadipogenic activity in the TIII and TIV mixtures, such as triacetin, kaempferol-3-O-rhamnoside, and quercetin 3-O-rhamnoside. Therefore, we can conclude that the presence of these compounds is essential for the inhibition of the differentiation of preadipocyte-like cells into mature adipocytes. This knowledge is very useful for proposing the development of potential medications against obesity or overweight, which can be developed using standardized extracts rich in these polyphenolic compounds.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, A.Z., O.R.-C., A.R.J.-A. and A.L.I.-G.; funding acquisition, A.Z., A.R.J.-A., O.R.-C. and A.L.I.-G.; investigation, A.Z., A.R.J.-A., A.L.I.-G., R.M.M.-R. and M.G.-C.; resources A.Z., M.G.-C. and A.L.I.-G.; writing\u2014review and editing, A.L.I.-G., A.R.J.-A., J.T., R.M.M.-R. and A.Z.
