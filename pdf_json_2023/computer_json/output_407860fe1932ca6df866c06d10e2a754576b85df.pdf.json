            "text": "Expression and recognition of feelings are crucial aspects of human communication and social interaction (Dolan, 2002). They significantly influence our experiences and shape our cognitive abilities, making emotional intelligence an essential component of artificial intelligence (Dolan, 2002). Emotion analysis is a growing research area that aims to enable machines to effectively recognize, analyze and understand human feelings and thinking (Mirzaee et al., 2022). Unlike sentiment analysis, emotion detection usually covers a broader range of responses, detecting a variety of emotions such as Anger, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, Happiness and more. Online social media platforms allow people to express their views on a wide range of topics such as personal, social, political, or even commercial views. Twitter is one of the rich online sources for text analysis tasks as it is concise yet abundant in emotional context. On Twitter, communication is unrestricted by politics, age, culture, gender, and other barriers (Ghosh et al., 2020). In the current media landscape, knowledge about people\u2019s opinions and emotions as expressed on social media can be important for various objectives, such as\ncustomer service, online sale, the analysis of political and cultural events etc. On December 20, 2022, the Taliban regime banned girls and women from pursuing education and employment in Afghanistan. This announcement shocked the world and the people of Afghanistan, and it was met with a serious and swift reaction from politicians and citizens of different countries, as well as the United Nations, political and civil figures, women activists, and citizens of Afghanistan. Many expressed their feelings against the Taliban\u2019s decision on Twitter, Facebook and other social media. In this paper, we present LetHerLearn: a Persian Dari corpus of emotion-annotated Twitter data based on the collection and analysis of tweets related to the ban of education in Afghanistan by the Taliban regime. The goal of this work is to provide insights into people\u2019s real-time perspectives, attitudes, concerns and reactions in the face of this oppression. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses related work, focusing in particular on previous work for Persian, Section 3 then goes on to describe the creation of the LetHerLearn dataset, detailing the motivation for this work, data collection, annotation and relevant statistics. Section 4 presents details on modeling and results for experimental evaluations of a number of neural architectures trained and evaluated on LetHerLearn, and finally, Section 5 concludes the paper and describes some possible avenues for future work."

            "text": "In recent years, research on emotion recognition from text has received increasing attention in the research community, and several annotated corpora have been created for this purpose (Ghosh et al., 2020). These corpora serve as valuable resources for researchers to develop and build emotion recognition models (Nandwani and Verma,\n1\n2021). While there has been significant progress in emotion recognition research from text, there are still some languages for which there is relatively little research. Persian is one such language, where there is currently not much research and limited availability of these types of datasets. Despite the relatively limited previous work on emotion detection in Persian language, there is some work on resource creation in the related area of Sentiment Analysis, such as the SentiPers dataset (Hosseini et al., 2018), the Digikala dataset (Zobeidi et al., 2019) and the Pars-ABSA dataset (Ataei et al., 2019) , all based based on Iranian user comments. When it comes to the task of Persian Emotion Detection, the ARMANEMO dataset (Mirzaee et al., 2022) contains user opinions from social media and the dataset is annotated using a mixture of manual and automatic steps, labeling 7500 comments into the 7 classes of Anger, Fear, Joy, Hatred, Sadness, Surprise and Others. The authors trained and evaluated a number of neural models (CNN, RNN, ParsBERT, XLM-Roberta-base and XLM-Roberta-large models) on the dataset and the best performing model was XML-RoBERTalarge, achieving a macro-averaged F1 score of 75.39%. The EmoPars dataset (Sabri et al., 2021), contains 30,000 emotional tweets collected from Twitter using specific emotion-related keywords and the dataset was manually annotated into the Anger, Fear, Happiness, Hatred, Sadness andWonder classes. This constitutes the most similar existing dataset to the one presented here. In the following we will discuss the rationale behind the data creation effort presented here."

            "text": "Despite the previous research on emotion detection in Persian, as detailed in Section 2 above, there is still a lack of research and resources for different Persian varieties. The Persian language is an Indo-European language which has more than 110 million speakers worldwide and is an official lan-\nguage in Iran, Afghanistan and Tajikistan (Heydari, 2019). The Persian variant spoken in Iran is called Farsi, in Afghanistan it is called Dari and in Tajikistan Tajiki (Spooner, 2012). Farsi, Dari and Tajik have the same alphabet and grammar with different accents on words in each country. There are, however, clear differences in vocabulary, where Farsi tends to have more borrowings from French and Dari from English. Crucially, however, all the described datasets above are developed based on Iranian social media and speakers and none of these are based on textual data from Afghanistan and Tajikistan. The lack of an emotion annotated dataset from Dari speakers of Persian, has motivated the creation of the Dari LetHerLearn dataset described here. As mentioned earlier, the events on December 20, 2022, where The Taliban banned education and all work activities for girls and women in Afghanistan caused massive emotional reaction on social media. We decided to base the first emotion annotated Dari dataset on social media data in order to analyse the reaction and opinion of the people faced with this event."

The included tweets were all posted from December 20, 2022 up to March 10, 2023. The search was conducted fromDecember 20, 2022 up toMarch 10, 2023 and using the mentioned hashtags, we collected around fifty thousand tweets. Following removal of duplicated tweets, we selected 7600 tweets for manual labeling."

            "text": "Two annotators were involved in labeling the LetHerLearn corpus. Both of the annotators are Dari native speakers with good knowledge and understanding of Dari grammar. We annotated based on Ekman\u2019s (Ekman, 1992) set of fundamental emotions, which is widely used by annotators for annotation of emotions in text. The corpus includes 6 fundamental Emotions (Anger, Disgust,\nFear, Happiness, Sadness and Surprise) and we used the \u2019Other\u2019 category for tweets that do not fall into any of the six basic Emotions. Each tweet was assigned a maximum of one emotion. In the case of tweets containing several emotions, the annotators were instructed to assign the emotion they felt was dominant. The annotators were provided with a set of annotation guidelines written in Dari. The annotators were instructed to remove tweets in languages like Pashto and Uzbek, even if they were written in the Persian script. Incomplete tweets, for example, those missing parts of the content along with hashtags or external links, should also be removed. The full set of guidelines (in Dari and English translation) are distributed along with the dataset, however we provide a brief summary of the guidelines below.\nAnnotation guidelines The guidelines provided to the annotators contain detailed descriptions of the six emotions with example words typically associated with the different emotions. For instance, the Anger class was described as comprising tweets reflecting emotions of anger, criticism, or frustration where the text may be confrontational, express strong negative feelings, or carry a tone of harsh criticism. Words symbolizing anger might include terms such as \u2018lying\u2019, \u2018spy\u2019, \u2018traitor\u2019, \u2018hypocrite\u2019, \u2018oppression\u2019 etc. In addition to instructions describing each emotion class, care was taken to delimit the class of \u201dOther\u201d which represents tweets that do not display any particular emotion and convey a neutral tone. For instance, tweets about mundane activities or more fact-based posts would fall under this category. Annotators were further instructed to do their best to not let personal agreement or disagreement with the opinions stated in the tweets influence the labeling process and to label without any bias or directionality. Rather, they were instructed\nto depart from their interpretation of the speaker\u2019s emotional state and attempt to describe it as accurately as possible using one of the provided emotion labels. Table 1 shows some examples of tweets (with English translations) from the LetHerLearn dataset to further illustrate the annotation effort.\nInter-annotator agreement We further assess the consistency of annotations and measure the agreement among two annotators using Cohen\u2019s Kappa (Cohen, 1960) for the double labeling of 100 tweets. The agreement attained over the 100 tweets was 0.80."

Figure 1 shows the occurrences of tweets for each emotion class. Examining the content of the LetHerLearn dataset, we can see that Anger is the most observed emotion, followed by Happiness, and we find that Surprise is the least observed emotion, with only 503 occurrences. The dataset was further split into train-dev-test splits using a 80:10:10 split for experimentation. Table 2 shows the detailed class-wise distribution of train, validation, and test set. Next, and in order to get some more insight into the contents of our dataset, we examine the distribution of most frequent words per class following stop word removal, as shown in table 3 which displays the top frequent words for each of the emotion classes. We observe that some words frequently occur in all classes such as \u2018Taliban\u2019, \u2018Afghanistan\u2019, \u2018girls\u2019, \u2018women\u2019, \u2018everyone\u2019.

We also observe lexical items describing the cause of emotion, e.g. \u2018explosion\u2019 and \u2018arrest\u2019 for Fear and \u2018justice\u2019 for Happiness."

We further find that the XLM-RoBERTa-large model outperforms the other models. The per-\nclass results, shown in Table 6 show that the scores vary for the different emotion classes, with the highest results obtained for the Disgust and Fear classes, and the most difficult classes being the Other class, as well as the Anger class."

We find that Surprise is often mistaken for other categories, such as Happiness, Other and Anger. Not surprisingly perhaps, the Other class is also often mistaken for other classes. Following our analysis of the misclassified predictions, we can infer some of the reasons: the assignment of a maximum of one emotion for each tweet is problematic for some of the tweets that havemore than emotion. We also analyze the word overlap between the tweets and find that classes\nwith a high degree of overlap tend to also suffer from misclassification. Table 5 shows some examples of misclassified predictions."

The optimizer is adam and the number of epochs is 30 with learning rates of 0.01. and an output layer with 7 neurons, one for each class, batch size is 80.\nBidirectional Long Short Term Memory Network (Bi-LSTM) We use Bidirectional LSTMs with SpatialDropout1D of 0.2 and dropout and recurrent-dropout of 70%. We trained with different optimizers and achieved the highest result with adam, 30 epochs and a learning rates of 0.01 with batch size 64.\nGated Recurrent Unit (GRU) The GRU network has 4 layer in our proposed model and after feature extraction using fastText word embedding, the embedding layer of size (15130, 300) constitutes the input. We used adam optimizer with \u03b21 = 0.9, \u03b22 = 0.999 and learning rate of 0.01. Our model includes 64 neurons, SpatialDropout1D of 0.2 and dropout and recurrent-dropout of 65%.\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) Our proposed CNNmodel has four layers, the Conv1D layer has 256 filters and a kernel size of 5 with relu activation function. The Dense layer has seven unit with softmax activation function, batch size is 96, Dropout value is 0.7 and we used the adam optimizer with \u03b21 = 0.9, \u03b22 = 0.999 and learning rate of 0.01.\nParsBERT The hyperparameters for the ParsBERT model fine-tuning was performed for seven epochs with a batch size of 32, specifying the maximum length of the encoded sequence to 128 and using the AdamW optimizer with \u03b21 = 0.9, \u03b22 = 0.999, learning rate scheduler is (2e-5) and linearly decreasing from the initial to 0 by the end of the last epoch.\nXLM-RoBERTa-large The hyperparameters for the the XLM-RoBERTa-large is eight epochs, batch size of 32, learning_rate of 2e-5, optimizer of Adam and maximum length of 128. Table 6 shows the prediction results for each emotion class using this model."
