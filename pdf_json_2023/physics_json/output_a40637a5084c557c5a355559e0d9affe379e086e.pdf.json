Introduction 30 Protein ubiquitylation regulates virtually all cellular processes, underlining its 31 importance in the cell well-being, and its implications in multiple pathologies (1). 32 Ubiquitin (Ub) attachment (AKA conjugation) occurs mainly in lysine (K) residues on 33 the target proteins but also on any of the 8 reactive residues present on Ub itself (M1, 34 K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48 or K63) (2). For this reason, Ub imposes distinct 35 conformations to the target protein depending on the number of moieties attached to its 36 surface, or the type of Ub chains formed. The complexity of the Ub chains increases 37 when other post-translational modifications (PTMs) such as phosphorylation, 38 acetylation, SUMOylation or NEDDylation act on the same Ub reactive residues. This 39 complex language and its regulation, known as \u201cthe Ubiquitin Code\u201d, is far from being 40 fully understood and only some generic functions for few Ub chains have been 41 elucidated over the years (3). For example, typical Ub chains, like K48 and K11 have 42 been associated to proteasomal degradation, while K63 is usually linked to the 43 regulation of signal transduction and the autophagy pathway. Less abundant atypical Ub 44 chains such as K6, K27, K29, K33, and M1 have not been fully deciphered most likely 45 due to the difficulty to fully characterise their functions (3, 4). The high reversibility 46 and heterogeneity of those Ub modifications complicate their isolation, quantitation, 47 and characterisation of the functions they regulate. A better characterisation of the 48 molecular mechanisms underlying Ub regulated processes is essential to understand cell 49 physiology and pathology (2). 50\nincluding the use of Ub K to R mutants and tagged Ub-like molecules (UbLs). 52 However, the use of Ub mutants and overexpression has disadvantages, mainly because 53 they can induce perturbations in the natural equilibrium of Ub chains and UbL 54 molecules resulting in aberrant patterns of protein ubiquitylation complicating data 55 interpretation (5). Furthermore, some of these techniques cannot be used to analyse 56 samples derived from patients (6, 7). Ub-binding domains with Ub-chains preferences 57 have been also used to explore processes regulated by protein ubiquitylation when 58 associated to mass spectrometry (MS) (7, 8). Moreover, Ub antibodies directed against 59 specific Ub-linkages showed some success in immunoprecipitation and 60 immunofluorescence application. However, only few Ub-chain specific antibodies have 61 been developed in part due to the low reactivity of this highly conserved molecule. In 62 contrast, antibodies recognising the double glycine (\u201cdiGly\u201d) Ub signature showed good 63 success in MS studies even if these cannot distinguish the common signature shared 64 with NEDD8 or ISG15 (9, 10). An important aspect that has contributed to increase our 65 understanding of functions regulated by Ub is the huge progress in MS technology, 66 achieved by enhancing sensitivity, accuracy and duty cycle of the machines and 67 improving in the sample preparation methods. 68 Camelid heavy-chain antibodies, also known as VHH (variable heavy homodimers) or 69 nanobodies, are single domain antigen-binding fragments that have been used in 70 research, diagnostics and therapeutics (11\u201313). Nanobodies have a smaller size than 71 mammalian antibodies, a single-domain nature, and can be produced as a robust entity 72 very efficiently and with high solubility. Due to its monomeric nature, high stability, 73 selectivity and small size, VHH have been used as sensitive detection probes in 74 complex samples. Even if it is not the most obvious, VHHs can be generated against 75\nwith protein conformation/localisation, or regulate functions (in vivo 77 immunomodulators) (12, 13). 78 Taking advantage of a full synthetic system that bypass immunogenicity and specificity 79 problems, this scaffold has been used to develop chain-specific nanobodies (7). When 80 isolated by phage display these polypeptides can be used as minibodies when cloned 81 into vectors expressing the heavy chain of various species or as nanobodies when 82 cloned in vectors with multiple tags (14). 83 Here we report the protocol for the purification of endogenous Ub chains using K63 and 84 K48 nanobodies that can be used for identification of target proteins by MS. The 85 protocol includes 4 sections, 1) The purification of Ub chain-specific nanobodies from 86 bacteria; 2) The crosslinking of these nanobodies into a magnetic column (see Figure 87 1); 3) Isolation of ubiquitylated proteins from mammalian cells and 4) Sample 88 preparation for MS analysis (see Figure 2). The purified material obtained from 89 mammalian cells can also be used for western blot (WB) analysis or 90 immunoprecipitations with antibodies recognising proteins of interest. In this protocol, 91 we have used mantle cell lymphoma cells, but depending on the cell type and the 92 application of interest, this protocol can be easily adapted. 93 94 2.

Desalt peptides using reverse phase C18 HPLC column and then store them at -20\u00b0C, 292 before MS analysis. 293 294 4. Notes 295\n2. Other crosslinking procedures can be tested to optimise the recovery of the captured 297 ubiquitylated proteins, including dimethyl pimelimidate-based protocols. 298 3. This medium was used to grow mantle cell lymphoma cell lines (MCL) but medium 299 can be adapted to other cell lines. 300 4. Alternative inhibitors such as MG132 instead of bortezomib, PR619 instead of 301 chemical deubiquitinase inhibitors such as iodoacetamide or N-ethylmaleimide can be 302 used to avoid losing ubiquitylated proteins during the lysis step. 303 5. The His tag or a Myc tag also included in the nanobody can be used to analyse the 304 integrity and the quality of purification of these tools. 305 6. In order to reduce contaminants during the isolation of ubiquitylated proteins from 306 mammalian cells, affinity chromatography is performed within a clean area using gloves 307 during all the procedure. 308 7. Affinity columns can be prepared using other supports such as nickel-agarose or 309 nickel-sepharose beads. 310 8. Magnetic beads also avoid the use of centrifugation steps that could precipitate 311 unspecific high molecular weight protein complexes 312 9. Excess of Nickel beads should be prepared since some could be lost during the 313 washing steps of the crosslinking protocol. 314 10. Different cells provide distinct total protein concentration per million of cells. For 315 this reason, 500 \u03bcg of total protein is a better reference to set up a protocol before 316 scaling up to 2 mg of total protein per point. 317 11. The number of beads and nanobodies required to capture the ubiquitylated fraction 318 from a given sample must be optimised to avoid saturation of the beads or nanobodies. 319\nbetween samples. 321 12. If aggregates are observed during the nanobody/beads binding step, the 322 concentration of detergent should be increased in the Binding Buffer. 323 13. Cell lysis should be done on ice to prevent enzymatic activities that could remove 324 Ub or degrade modified proteins. The time between the lysis and the incubation with the 325 crosslinked nanobodies should be as short as possible. 326 14. Binding time can be adjusted: increase it if ubiquitylated proteins are highly 327 abundant or decrease it in the opposite situation. During the binding step, keep tubes 328 safely close to avoid spills. 329 15. The use of crosslinked nanobodies allows to increase the number of washes or the 330 use of stringent washing conditions if required. Detergent can be added to increase the 331 stringency. 332 16. The different washing steps were optimised to reduce the binding of unspecific 333 proteins compared to a negative control (magnetic beads only). 334 17. Do not freeze magnetic beads bound to captured ubiquitylated proteins prior the 335 final heating step, since this could damage the magnetic properties of some beads. 336 18. Eluted magnetic beads can be resuspended in Boiling Buffer to test if some 337 ubiquitylated proteins are still attached. In this case, another boiling step is required to 338 recover those proteins. 339 19. If the protein sample volume exceeds 0.5 ml, perform step 1 of section 3.4 the 340 number of times necessary to load the entire sample volume to the ultracentrifuge filter. 341 342 343 Acknowledgements: 344\nproofreading of this manuscript.
