Exploration of Other Bioactive Components: While cordycepin has been identified as a key antimicrobial component in the spent substrate of C. militaris, the study hints at the presence of multiple active components. Future research could focus on isolating, identifying, and characterizing these other components. This exploration could reveal new compounds with antimicrobial, antioxidant, or anti-inflammatory properties that could have pharmaceutical or cosmetic applications.

Mechanistic Studies of Antioxidant and Anti-inflammatory Activities: The study demonstrates the spent substrate's efficacy in scavenging free radicals and reducing inflammation, but the mechanisms behind these effects remain unclear. Investigating the pathways through which the substrate's components exert their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects could uncover new therapeutic targets and enhance understanding of how these natural products can be used to combat oxidative stress and inflammation.

Development of Pharmaceutical or Cosmetic Formulations: With proven antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities, the spent substrate extract of C. militaris presents a valuable resource for developing new pharmaceutical or cosmetic products. Future research could focus on formulation development, including the optimization of extraction methods to increase yield and purity of active components, stability studies, and efficacy testing in clinical trials.

Synergistic Effects with Other Natural Products: The study opens the possibility of combining the spent substrate extract of C. militaris with other natural products known for similar or complementary activities. Investigating synergistic effects could lead to the development of more effective antimicrobial, antioxidant, or anti-inflammatory formulations. This line of research would involve screening combinations of natural products for enhanced activity and understanding the interaction mechanisms.

Environmental Impact and Sustainability Studies: Considering the spent substrate is currently treated as waste, utilizing it as a source of bioactive compounds offers environmental and economic benefits. Research into the sustainability of using spent mushroom substrate, including life cycle analysis, could highlight the environmental impact of repurposing agricultural waste. Additionally, studies could explore the scalability of extraction processes and assess the overall sustainability of this approach in the context of circular economy principles.
