    "abstractText": "The pluramycin family of natural products has diverse substituents at the C2 position, which are closely related to their biological activity. Therefore, it is important to understand the biosynthesis of C2 substituents. In this study, we describe the biosynthesis of C2 moieties in Streptomyces sp. W2061, which produces kidamycin and rubiflavinone C-1, containing anthrapyran aglycones. Sequence analysis of the loading module (Kid13) of the PKS responsible for the synthesis of these anthrapyran aglycones is useful for confirming the incorporation of atypical primer units into the corresponding products. Kid13 is a ketosynthaselike decarboxylase (KSQ)-type loading module with unusual dual acyltransferase (AT) domains (AT1-1 and AT1-2). The AT1-2 domain primarily loads ethylmalonylCoA and malonyl-CoA for rubiflavinone and kidamycinone and rubiflavinone, respectively; however, the AT1-1 domain contributed to the functioning of the AT1-2 domain to efficiently load ethylmalonyl-CoA for rubiflavinone. We found that the dual AT system was involved in the production of kidamycinone, an aglycone of kidamycin, and rubiflavinone C-1 by other shared biosynthetic genes in Streptomyces sp. W2061. This study broadens our understanding of the incorporation of atypical primer units into polyketide products.",

Therefore, it is important to understand the biosynthesis of C2 substituents. In this study, we\u00a0describe the biosynthesis of C2 moieties in Streptomyces sp. W2061, which produces kidamycin and rubiflavinone C-1, containing anthrapyran aglycones. Sequence analysis of the loading module (Kid13) of the PKS responsible for the synthesis of these anthrapyran aglycones is useful for confirming the incorporation of atypical primer units into the corresponding products. Kid13 is a ketosynthaselike decarboxylase (KSQ)-type loading module with unusual dual acyltransferase (AT) domains (AT1-1 and AT1-2). The AT1-2 domain primarily loads ethylmalonylCoA and malonyl-CoA for rubiflavinone and kidamycinone and rubiflavinone, respectively; however, the AT1-1 domain contributed to the functioning of the AT1-2 domain to efficiently load ethylmalonyl-CoA for rubiflavinone. We\u00a0 found that the dual AT system was involved in the production of kidamycinone, an aglycone of kidamycin, and rubiflavinone C-1 by other shared biosynthetic genes in Streptomyces sp. W2061. This study broadens our understanding of the incorporation of atypical primer units into polyketide products.\nKEYWORDS\nbiosynthesis, natural products, polyketide synthase, dual acyltransferase, Streptomyces\nIntroduction\nAngucycline polyketides are a group of natural products synthesized by polyketide synthases (PKSs), which have diverse structures and a broad variety of biological activities, such as antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, and anticancer activities (Kharel et\u00a0al., 2012; Katz and Baltz, 2016). In bacteria, aromatic polyketides are usually biosynthesized by type II PKSs through a ketosynthase (KS)/chain length factor (CLF) heterodimer (KS-CLF) that iteratively elongates a poly-\u03b2-ketone chain linked to an acyl carrier protein (ACP) (Staunton and Weissman, 2001; Hertweck et\u00a0 al., 2007). A typical KS-CLF is primed with an acetate unit through the decarboxylation of malonyl-ACP. While only a few type II PKSs that use other starter units have been identified, the use of different starter units could provide additional structurally diverse products (Moore and Hertweck, 2002; Hertweck, 2009; Lesnik et\u00a0 al., 2015). For example, doxorubicin is primed by a propionyl unit, oxytetracycline by a malonamyl unit, frenolicin by"

Although the mechanism of attachment of starter units has been controversial in several case studies, one can speculate that the activation and transfer of these non-acetate starter units are mediated by crotonyl-CoA carboxylase/reductase, CoA ligases, 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III (KASIII), and an atypical acyltransferase (AT) (Bililign et\u00a0al., 2004; Hertweck et\u00a0al., 2007; Wilson and Moore, 2012).\nThe pluramycin family of angucycline antitumor antibiotics is a structurally complex DNA-reactive agent consisting of a planar anthrapyran substructure with variations in the side chain at C2 and substitution patterns of C-arylglycosidic deoxyaminosugars on the aglycone backbone (Schmitz et\u00a0al., 1966; Umezawa et\u00a0al., 1973; Cairns and Murray, 1998; Kharel et\u00a0al., 2012; Lee et\u00a0al., 2023). This unusual distal side chain implies the use of a non-acetate starter unit in anthrapyran aglycone biosynthesis. Among them, the bis-epoxide side chain of hedamycin is formed in the hybrid type I/type II PKS biosynthetic machinery (Bililign et\u00a0al., 2004; Figure\u00a01). Type I\u00a0PKS acts iteratively to generate the hexadienyl starter unit that subsequently primes the partner type II PKS (Das and Khosla, 2009). In contrast, the hexadienyl side chain of fredericamycin, although it also synthesizes a similar six-carbon intermediate to hedamycin, is produced by the reduction of two-ketoacyl-ACP intermediates during two rounds of chain elongation via a three-ketoacyl ACP reductase (Das et\u00a0al., 2010). Kidamycin (1), a member of the pluramycin family, has been derivatized in an attempt to increase its therapeutic index (Fei and Mcdonald, 2005, 2007; O\u2019keefe et\u00a0al., 2011; Mabit et\u00a0al., 2017) and has a shorter fourcarbon (2-methylbut-2-ene) side chain than hedamycin; however, its biosynthetic mechanism has not been reported.\nKidamycin (1) was first identified in Streptomyces phaeoverticillatus in 1971 (Kanda, 1971). It was subsequently isolated from several\nunidentified Streptomyces species. Compound 1 and its photoreactive derivative (2) showed promising anticancer activity against the triplenegative breast cancer cell line MDA-231 (Lee et\u00a0al., 2023). Notably, our 1 producer, Streptomyces sp. W2061, also produces a de-epoxide hedamycin aglycone derivative, rubiflavinone C-1 (3), containing a hexadienyl side chain (Figure\u00a01). It is estimated that the two types of compounds with different distal side chains will somehow be\u00a0shared by type II PKSs involved in the backbone biosynthesis pathway, with an alternative starter unit for chain elongation. Previously, the biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) of 1 (kid) was identified from the Streptomyces sp. W2061 (Heo et\u00a0al., 2022). Our findings revealed that the kid BGC has a gene composition similar to that of the hedamycin BGC. Two type I\u00a0PKS modules, similar to the hedamycin BGC, were also found; however, the domain architecture of each module did not completely match that of hedamycin. The first module (Kid13) contains two unusual acyltransferase (AT) domains (AT1-1 and AT1-2), and the second module (Kid14) carries an AT domain (AT2) with methylmalonyl-CoA-specific sequences and an additional enoylreductase (ER) domain (Figure\u00a01). Based on heterologous expression and site-directed mutagenesis, the type I\u00a0PKS system in kid BGC is responsible for the formation of both kidamycinone (4), an anthrapyran aglycone of 1, and 3. Furthermore, we\u00a0propose that the AT1-2 domain mainly loads both malonyl-CoA and ethylmalonyl-CoA for 1 and 3, but the AT1-1 domain acts in harmony to load ethylmalonyl-CoA efficiently for 3 by AT1-2 domain."

Phylogenetic tree analysis using the minimum evolution method was based on the results of sequence alignment, and evolutionary distances were computed using the Poisson correction method in MEGA 7 software (Kumar et\u00a0al., 2016).\nCloning of the kidamycin minimal PKS region\nTo clone the minimal PKS region of kidamycin, we\u00a0constructed a cosmid library of Streptomyces sp. W2061 using the Supercos1\nvector kit and Gigapack III gold packaging extract (Agilent Technologies, CA, United\u00a0States; #251301, #200201) and screened via PCR with appropriate primers (kid4-H1-F/kid4-H1-R and kidR1sc_F/kidR1sc_R) (Supplementary Table S1). A positive clone containing the kidamycin-minimal PKS region was obtained. The cosmid vectors were digested with HpaI for linearization and cloned into pCAP03-acc(3)IV (Tang et\u00a0 al., 2015) via transformationassociated recombination (TAR) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4727 (Yamanaka et\u00a0al., 2014). For TAR cloning, BY4727 was inoculated in 5 mL YPD (glucose 20 g/L, yeast extract 10 g/L, and peptone 20 g/L) from a plate colony and cultured at 30\u00b0C for 2 days, harvested, and washed with 1 mL LiAc/TE (0.1 M LiAc, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA). The harvested cells were resuspended in 0.5 mL of LiAc/TE, and 100 \u03bcL aliquoted cells were used for the TAR experiment. Specific capture arms were synthesized (Supplementary Table S1) and cloned into the pCAP03-acc(3)IV vector (digested with NdeI and XhoI) via Gibson assembly. Linearized cosmid and linearized specific capture vector with PacI were added to yeast cells with 50 \u03bcg salmon sperm DNA (Sigma-Aldrich, United\u00a0States) and 0.6 mL PEG/LiAc (40% PEG 3350, 0.1 M LiAc, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA). The mixture was incubated at 30\u00b0C for 30 min, and 70 \u03bcL of DMSO was added to enhance the transformation efficiency. Heat shock was demonstrated at 42\u00b0C for 15 min and chilled on ice for 5 min. Finally, cells were resuspended in 200 \u03bcL of yeast synthetic tryptophan drop-out medium (TD) and spread on the TD plate, which contained 5-fluoroorotic acid 0.001% (w/v) (Zymo Research, CA, United\u00a0 States). Positive clones were selected by colony PCR using two primer pairs (kid4-H1-F/kid4H1-R and kidR1sc_F/kidR1sc_R). Plasmids (pCAP03-kidm2) were isolated from the positive clone and transferred to E. coli DH5\u03b1. The constructs were amplified in E. coli and confirmed via restriction enzyme digestion (Supplementary Figure S1).\nIn vitro CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing\nThe reaction mixture (30 \u03bcL) containing 10 \u03bcg target plasmid (pCAP03-kidm2), 20 nM Cas9 protein (New England Biolabs, MA, United\u00a0States), 3 \u03bcL NEB buffer 3.1, and 10 nM synthetic sgRNAs (Bioneer, Daejeon, Korea) were incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. The digested plasmid was recovered from the agarose gel. Briefly, the gel fragment of interest was cut into 1\u20132 mm pieces and placed in an Eppendorf tube with an equal volume of phenol. The tube was placed at \u221280\u00b0C for 5 min and at room temperature (20\u00b0C) for 20 min. The mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at room temperature. The supernatant was recovered and precipitated DNA by adding 1/10 volume of 5 M NaCl and 2.5 volume of cold 100% ethanol. The tube was placed at \u221280\u00b0C for 15 min and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 min. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in water.

The plasmid with the target region removed was religated and transformed into E. coli.

For site-directed mutagenesis of the AT1-1\nFrontiers in Microbiology 04 frontiersin.org\nand AT1-2 domains, four sgRNAs (AT1-1_sg1 and AT1-1_sg2 for AT1-1 and AT1-2_sg1 and AT1-2_sg2 for AT1-2, Supplementary Table S1) were designed, synthesized, and used for digestion with the Cas9 enzyme as mentioned above. Oligomers were designed to inactivate the AT domain by replacing the active serine site with alanine (AT1-1_A for AT1-1 and AT1-2_A for AT1-2). Oligomers were annealed with 1 \u03bcL of 10 \u00d7 PCR buffer, incubated at 95\u00b0C for 10 min, and cooled down to 30\u00b0C for 20 min. CRISPR-Cas9 digested plasmid and annealed oligomers were mixed with Gibson Assembly Master mix (New England Biolabs), incubated at 50\u00b0C for 1 h, and transformed into E. coli according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Positive constructs were screened via digestion of PCR products amplified with appropriate primer pairs (AT1D_scF and AT1D_scR for AT1-1 inactivation and AT1-2_scF and AT1-2_scR for AT1-2 inactivation) (Supplementary Figure S3).\nConstruction of gene disruption vectors and mutant strains\nGene knockout recombinants were generated using homologous recombination. The target region was replaced with a kanamycin resistance gene. The kanamycin resistance cassette was digested with KpnI and PstI from plasmid pFD-NEO-S (Supplementary Table S2). Two homologous regions were amplified using the appropriate primers (Supplementary Table S1). To inactivate kid13, a 1.4 kb EcoRI/KpnI fragment generated using kid13-H1-F and kid13-H1-R (Supplementary Table S1) and a 1.2 kb PstI/HindIII fragment generated using kid13-H2-F and Kid13-H2-R (Supplementary Table S1) were digested, ligated, and cloned in the EcoRI and HindIII sites of pKC1139 to yield pKC1139-Kid13H12neo. To generate a mutant strain, three fragments were ligated with plasmid pKC1139 and introduced into Streptomyces sp. W2061. The W2061 strain was conjugated with E. coli ET12567/pUZ8002. Exconjugants were selected based on antibiotic resistance (kanamycin and apramycin) and PCR genotyping. Doublecrossover mutants were screened based on kanamycin resistance and PCR genotyping (kid13_scF/R for \u2206Kid13 mutant) (Supplementary Table S1).\nFor deletion of the AT1-1 domain in the Streptomyces sp. W2061 strain, the pCRISPomyces-2 system was used (Cobb et\u00a0al., 2014). The sequence of the two sgRNAs was the same as that used to generate the Kidm2-AT1D construct. The recombination template was obtained from kidm2-AT1D by PstI digestion and cloned into the T-Blunt vector PstI site (BioFact, Daejeon, Korea) to generate the AT1DH_TA construct. AT1DH_TA was digested with SpeI and XbaI and cloned into the pCRISPomyces-2 vector at the XbaI site. The final vector (pCRIAT1D) was conjugated from E. coli ET12567/pUZ8002 to the Streptomyces sp. W2061 strain. Following conjugation, individual exconjugants were incubated on an R2YE liquid medium supplemented with 50 mg/mL apramycin at 28\u00b0C for 3 days. Clearance of the temperature-sensitive plasmid was accomplished with high-temperature cultivation (42\u00b0C) for 2\u20135 days, followed by replica plating on selective and non-selective plates to confirm loss of apramycin resistance. To determine the in-frame deletion, each selected apramycin-sensitive colony was subjected to PCR using appropriate primer pairs (AT1D_scF and AT1D_scR) (Supplementary Figure S4)."

The structures of the compounds were determined based on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis (Supplementary Table S3). Those compounds (3\u20135) are identified based on a comparison of previously reported NMR data and molecular formula (Mabit et\u00a0al., 2017; Heo et\u00a0al., 2022)."

We\u00a0previously reported the kid BGC from Streptomyces sp. W2061 (Heo et\u00a0al., 2022), which is similar in content and organization to the known hedamycin BGC (Bililign et\u00a0al., 2004). We\u00a0also confirmed that Kid19, a ketosynthase of type II PKS, is responsible for the biosynthesis of the angucycline core (Heo et\u00a0al., 2022).\nFrontiers in Microbiology 05 frontiersin.org\nIn this study, we\u00a0inactivated the type I\u00a0PKS gene (kid13), which may be\u00a0 involved in the production of the aglycone side chain moiety. The gene disrupted mutant (\u0394kid13) results revealed a complete loss of productivity of 1, photokidamycin (2), and rubiflavinone C-1 (3), which is a similar production pattern with the type II PKS gene mutant (\u0394kid19) (Figure\u00a02). This indicated that two types of anthrapyran aglycones with different side chains at C2 can be\u00a0synthesized from one type I\u00a0PKS (Kid13) and type II PKS. Collectively, type I\u00a0PKSs, including Kid13 and Kid14, can supply two types of precursors to type II PKSs (Kid15\u201319), which are responsible for the synthesis of the two types of anthrapyran backbones. Therefore, we\u00a0became interested in the mechanism by which the two types of anthrapyran can be\u00a0synthesized in a hybrid type I/II PKS system."

The 2-methyl-2,4-hexadiene moiety at the C2 position of 3 may also be\u00a0 formed via the same biosynthetic pathway as the bis-epoxide side chain of hedamycin. The bis-epoxide side chain originates from a 2,4-hexadienyl primer unit synthesized from type I\u00a0PKS, encoded by hedT and hedU in the hedamycin BGC (Bililign et\u00a0al., 2004; Das and Khosla, 2009). Kid13, which corresponds with HedT, is a loading module including the KSQ domain and has a unique dual AT system with the domain architecture consisting of AT1-1-KSQ-AT1-2-ACP (Figure\u00a01).\nFIGURE\u00a02 Gene disruption of type I\u00a0PKS gene kid13.

W2061.\nFrontiers in Microbiology 06 frontiersin.org\nTo determine the substrate specificity of each AT in Kid13, phylogenetic tree analysis was conducted with known type I\u00a0PKS ATs. Phylogenetic tree analysis based on the amino acid sequences of the AT domains showed that both AT1-1 and AT1-2 grouped with malonylCoA-specific ATs. Interestingly, AT1-1 belongs to the malonyl-CoAspecific group but shows a far greater distance in this group (Figure\u00a03A). It is commonly known as the conserved amino acids, such as the \u201cHAFH motif \u201d to predict malonyl-CoA specificity, the \u201cYASH motif \u201d to predict methylmalonyl-CoA, and the \u201cVASH motif \u201d to predict ethylmalonyl-CoA; however, the \u201cHASH motif \u201d is used to predict both malonyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA (Dunn and Khosla, 2013). Specifically, AT1-1 has \u201cQAFH\u201d while AT1-2 has \u201cVAGH,\u201d and these motifs are not typical sequences found in the ATs of KSQ type loading modules, so no precise prediction of its substrate preference can be\u00a0made (Figure\u00a03B; Supplementary Figure S2). These data indicated that the substrate specificity of ATs in Kid13 is not predictable, Kid13 may have a different loading mechanism compared with general type I\u00a0PKS, and the unusual dual AT architecture of Kid13 can be\u00a0attributed to the synthesis of the two types of products from one gene cluster. Therefore, we\u00a0hypothesized that each AT has a different substrate specificity and can load two types of precursors to produce two types of anthrapyran, i.e., 1 and 3.\nIn addition, the second module encoded by the kid14 gene was also different from that encoded by hedamycin (hedU). Kid14 contains a methylmalonyl-CoA-specific AT and an additional reducing domain, the ER domain (Figure\u00a01). The second module (Kid14) was estimated to synthesize side chains different from HedU, and the second module of hedamycin biosynthesis was proposed to synthesize hexanoate units by iteratively extending two malonyl-CoA units (Das and Khosla, 2009). It has also been estimated that the C15 methyl residue of the hexanoate side chain in hedamycin is introduced by a methyltransferase; however, the methylation reaction has not yet been proven. However, the C15 methyl residues of 1 and 3 may originate from methylmalonyl-CoA because the AT2 domain of Kid14 has a methylmalonyl-CoA conserved motif, whereas the AT domain of\nHedU has a malonyl-CoA conserved motif (Figure\u00a03). Additionally, we\u00a0previously reported that all three methyltransferases in kid BGC are involved in the biosynthesis of amino sugars, such as N,N-dimethylvancosamine and angolosamine (Heo et\u00a0 al., 2022). Collectively, these results suggest that there is an important difference between 1 and hedamycin in side-chain biosynthesis.\nDual AT system of Kid13 involved in the formation of two different side chains\nWe attempted to identify the role of the dual AT system in heterogeneous strains with a minimal PKS region, containing biosynthetic genes for anthrapyran aglycone. The minimal PKS region was cloned using TAR methods (Yamanaka et\u00a0al., 2014; Kouprina and Larionov, 2016). The selected heterologous recombinant Kidm2 strain was inserted into hybrid type I/II PKS genes (kid12 to kid20), CYP450 (kid10), monooxygenase (kid11), and a regulatory gene (kidR-1) on the chromosome of Streptomyces albus (Figure\u00a0 4A; Supplementary Figure S1). The Kidm2 strain produced three new peaks compared with those of the parent S. albus. New peaks were identified as aglycones [kidamycinone (4) and epoxykidamycinone (5)] of 1 and 3 (Figure\u00a04; Supplementary Table S3). The 1H NMR spectral data for 4 isolates in this study were identical to those described in the literature (Mabit et\u00a0al., 2017). The other aglycone (5) had an epoxide bond at the C14,16 positions. The structure was elucidated by the upfield shift of the oxygenated carbon NMR signal (\u03b4C 57.6 and \u03b4C 62.0) compared with \u03b4C 127.5 and \u03b4C 134.7\u00a0in 4, and the degree of unsaturation was 15 (Heo et\u00a0al., 2022). The presence of 5 may form an epoxide state, in which a reduction in C\u2013C bonds occurs at C14\u201316. The reduction reaction is estimated to involve Kid10, which showed a high similarity to the HedR involved in introducing the bis-epoxide group of hedamycin (Bililign et\u00a0al., 2004).\nThis result demonstrated once again that the production of two types of anthrapyran aglycones can be\u00a0achieved by cloning the hybrid\nFIGURE\u00a03 Sequence analysis of three AT domains in Kid13 and Kid14.

Therefore, we\u00a0focused on the two AT domains in Kid13 and aimed to determine what happens to the production of the aglycones through inactivation experiments in the two AT domains of Kid13. Each AT in Kid13 was inactivated via site-directed mutagenesis by replacing serine, an active amino acid of AT, with alanine (Hans et\u00a0al., 2003). The first step in site-directed mutagenesis was performed by inserting a synthetic DNA fragment with a mutation in each AT domain using an in vitro CRISPR-Cas9 reaction (She et\u00a0 al., 2018) on the pCAP03-kidm2 vector (Supplementary Figure S3). Mutations in pCAP03-kidm2, pCAP03-AT1M, and pCAP03-AT2M were confirmed by the insertion of restriction enzyme sites SphI and FspI, respectively, at the mutation sites. The final mutant vectors were integrated with the heterologous host S. albus to generate the AT1M and AT2M strains (Figure\u00a04B). In addition, because AT1-1 is a unique extra domain that cannot be\u00a0found in a general KSQ-type loading module, an in-frame deleted construct of the AT1-1 domain (AT1D) was generated for comparison with the parent strain (Figure\u00a04B). The growth of mutant strains in the M2 medium was normal and comparable to that of the parent Kidm2 strain. Both the in-frame deletion (AT1D) and inactivated mutants (AT1M) of AT1-1 showed that short-chain molecules (4 and 5) were still produced, and the production of long-chain molecules (3) was markedly reduced to only the MS detection level (Figure\u00a0 4B). The production levels of short-chain molecules (4 and 5) in AT1D and AT1M were lower than those of the parent construct. This indicated that malonyl-CoA for short-chain molecules (4 and 5) can be\u00a0primarily loaded by AT1-2, and ethylmalonyl-CoA for the long chain of 3 can also be\u00a0loaded; however, the efficiency is low when AT1-2 works alone. Shortchain molecule 4, compared to 5, on the AT1M mutant was detected with low production; however, the reason for this cannot be\u00a0estimated. In contrast, the AT1-2 inactivated construct (AT2M) in the heterologous host produced only a small amount of 5, and the production of 3 was not detected (Figure\u00a04B). In addition, we\u00a0deleted the AT1-1 domain of the Kid13 module in the wild-type Streptomyces sp. W2061 strain using the pCRISPomyces-2 system (Cobb et\u00a0al., 2014; Supplementary Figure S4). The in-frame deletion mutant (W2061-AT1D) was found to have a 942-bp deletion at the 5\u2032 end of the kid13 gene (Supplementary Figure S4). The W2061-AT1D mutant produced\nFIGURE\u00a04 In-frame deletion and site-directed mutagenesis of AT domains of loading module (Kid13).

(B) Comparative LC-MS extracted ion chromatograms produced from the heterologous expression in recombinant S. albus and domain organization of recombinants (AT1D, AT1M, and AT2M) of the Kid13 module. AT1D, the AT1-1 domain marked with a dotted circle, was inactivated by an in-frame deletion in the heterologous S. albus (Kidm2) chromosome (Supplementary Figure S3). AT1M and AT2M, the AT1-1 and AT1-2 domains marked with a cross, were inactivated via site-specific mutagenesis, respectively.

Glycosylated short-chain molecules (1 and 2) are normally produced, although their productivity is marginally lower than that of the wild type. However, it was evidently observed that the production of long chain 3 significantly decreased (Figure\u00a05). These results suggested that AT1-2 is primarily involved in the transfer of malonyl-CoA for short-chain molecules and collaborates with AT1-1 in the efficient transfer of ethylmalonyl-CoA for long chains. Taken together, AT1-2 is the main acyl-CoA transferase in this PKS system for long and short chains, and AT1-1 plays an assistant role, especially for long chains, even if AT1-1 appears necessary. However, the production of short chains can be\u00a0produced on AT1-2 alone; however, AT1-1 is also required for effective production. Overall, AT1-2 primarily transfers malonyl-CoA to Kid13, whereas AT1-1 also loads malonyl-CoA, but not as much as AT1-2. Ethylmalonyl-CoA for long chains was loaded efficiently when AT1-1 and AT1-2 coexisted, indicating that AT1-1 and AT1-2 were simultaneously required to transfer ethylmalonyl-CoA (Figure\u00a06).\nFIGURE\u00a06 The proposed biosynthetic mechanism for the production of two different side chains of anthrapyran aglycone with an unusual dual AT system in Kid13.\nFIGURE\u00a05 Comparative LC-MS extracted ion chromatograms of culture extracts showing the wild type (A) and W2061-AT1D (B), which is an in-frame deleted mutant of AT1-1 domain in Streptomyces sp. W2061. Production levels are in the same order of magnitude.\nFrontiers in Microbiology 09 frontiersin.org\nAnother possibility is that the low productivity of the two chains in the AT1-1 deletion mutants may be\u00a0the result of protein instability or the discordant architecture of full Kid13 modules caused by the mutation.\nThe presence of two AT domains in the type I\u00a0 PKS loading module has been reported in biosynthetic pathways such as ajudazol, aurafuron, chondramide, and gulmirecin (Rachid et\u00a0al., 2006; Frank et\u00a0al., 2007; Buntin et\u00a0al., 2010; Schieferdecker et\u00a0al., 2014). These are loading machinery and have an ACP in the N-terminus, but Kid13 does not have an ACP domain in the N-terminus, indicating a new type of dual AT system. Meanwhile, the AT gene (hedF), which is located far from the type I\u00a0 PKS gene (hedT) in hedamycin BGC, showed high similarity (79%) and shared the unique conserved motif QAFH with AT1-1 (Figure\u00a03B). Notably, HedF is not involved in the chain initiation or elongation of the hexadine side chain (Das et\u00a0al., 2010). Although it is estimated that the presence of an independent AT protein will lose its function in the chain formation of hedamycin, the AT1-1 domain included in type I\u00a0PKS will maintain its role in the chain formation of 1 and 3. Therefore, these results are the first to demonstrate that a unique dual AT system of type I\u00a0PKS can provide two types of precursors to hybrid type II PKS.\nIn summary, we\u00a0found that type I\u00a0PKSs containing an unusual dual AT domain in the loading module (Kid13) synthesized four- or six-carbon intermediates, which are subsequently transferred to type II PKSs in the 4 and 3 biosynthetic pathways, respectively (Figure\u00a06). The presence of unusual loading and extension modules in these type I\u00a0PKSs (Kid13/Kid14) led to the incorporation of two different primer units, C4 and C6, which were significantly different from the chain initiation of hedamycin and fredericamycin. The dual domains (AT1-1 and AT1-2) worked together to load two different primer units. The AT1-2 domain primarily loaded both malonyl-CoA and ethylmalonyl-CoA for 4 and 3; however, the AT1-1 domain cooperated to load ethylmalonyl-CoA efficiently for 3 by the AT1-2 domain."
