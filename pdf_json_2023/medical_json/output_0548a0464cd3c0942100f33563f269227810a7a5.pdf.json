    "abstractText": "OBJECTIVE: This study compared the clinical effects of two different lipid emulsions in premature infants with gestational age < 32 weeks (VPI) or birth weight < 1500 g (VLBWI) to provide an evidence-based medicine basis for optimizing intravenous lipid emulsion. METHODS: This was a prospective multicenter randomized controlled study. A total of 465 VPIs or VLBWIs, admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of five tertiary hospitals in China from March 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021, were recruited. All subjects were randomly allocated into two groups, namely, medium-chain triglycerides/long-chain triglycerides (MCT/LCT) group (n= 231) and soybean oil, medium-chain triglycerides, olive oil, and fish oil (SMOF) group (n= 234). Clinical features, biochemical indexes, nutrition support therapy, and complications were analyzed and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: No significant differences were found in perinatal data, hospitalization, parenteral and enteral nutrition support between the two groups (P > 0.05). Compared with the MCT/LCT group, the incidence of neonates with a peak value of total bilirubin (TB) > 5mg/dL (84/231 [36.4% vs. 60/234 [25.6%]), a peak value of direct bilirubin (DB) \u2265 2mg/dL (26/231 [11.3% vs. 14/234 [6.0%]), a peak value of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) > 900 IU/L (17/231 [7.4% vs. 7/234 [3.0%]), and a peak value of triglycerides (TG) > 3.4 mmol/L (13/231 [5.6% vs. 4/234[1.7%]]) were lower in the SMOF group (P < 0.05). Univariate analysis showed that in the subgroup analysis of < 28 weeks, the incidence of parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis (PNAC) and metabolic bone disease of prematurity (MBDP) were lower in the SMOF group (P= 0.043 and 0.029, respectively), whereas no significant differences were present in the incidence of PNAC and MBDP between the two groups at > 28 weeks group (P= 0.177 and 0.991, respectively). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the incidence of PNAC (aRR: 0.38, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.20\u20130.70, P= 0.002) and MBDP (aRR: 0.12, 95% CI: 0.19\u20130.81, P= 0.029) in the SMOF group were lower than that in the MCT/LCT group. In addition, no significant differences were recorded in the incidence of patent ductus arteriosus, feeding intolerance, necrotizing enterocolitis (Bell\u2019s stage \u2265 2), late-onset sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, retinopathy of prematurity and extrauterine growth retardation between the two groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The application of mixed oil emulsion in VPI or VLBWI can reduce the risk of plasma TB > 5mg/dL, DB \u2265 2mg/dL, ALP > 900 IU/L, and TG > 3.4 mmol/L during hospitalization. SMOF has better lipid tolerance, reduces the incidence of PNAC and MBDP, and exerts more benefits in preterm infants with gestational age < 28 weeks.",

METHODS: This was a prospective multicenter randomized controlled study. A total of 465 VPIs or VLBWIs, admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of five tertiary hospitals in China from March 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021, were recruited. All subjects were randomly allocated into two groups, namely, medium-chain triglycerides/long-chain triglycerides (MCT/LCT) group (n= 231) and soybean oil, medium-chain triglycerides, olive oil, and fish oil (SMOF) group (n= 234). Clinical features, biochemical indexes, nutrition support therapy, and complications were analyzed and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: No significant differences were found in perinatal data, hospitalization, parenteral and enteral nutrition support between the two groups (P > 0.05). Compared with the MCT/LCT group, the incidence of neonates with a peak value of total bilirubin (TB) > 5mg/dL (84/231 [36.4% vs. 60/234 [25.6%]), a peak value of direct bilirubin (DB) \u2265 2mg/dL (26/231 [11.3% vs. 14/234 [6.0%]), a peak value of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) > 900 IU/L (17/231 [7.4% vs. 7/234 [3.0%]), and a peak value of triglycerides (TG) > 3.4 mmol/L (13/231 [5.6% vs. 4/234[1.7%]]) were lower in the SMOF group (P < 0.05). Univariate analysis showed that in the subgroup analysis of < 28 weeks, the incidence of parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis (PNAC) and metabolic bone disease of prematurity (MBDP) were lower in the SMOF group (P= 0.043 and 0.029, respectively), whereas no significant differences were present in the incidence of PNAC and MBDP between the two groups at > 28 weeks group (P= 0.177 and 0.991, respectively). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the incidence of PNAC (aRR: 0.38, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.20\u20130.70, P= 0.002) and MBDP (aRR: 0.12, 95% CI: 0.19\u20130.81, P= 0.029) in the SMOF group were lower than that in the MCT/LCT group. In addition, no significant differences were recorded in the incidence of patent ductus arteriosus, feeding intolerance, necrotizing enterocolitis (Bell\u2019s stage \u2265 2), late-onset sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, retinopathy of prematurity and extrauterine growth retardation between the two groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The application of mixed oil emulsion in VPI or VLBWI can reduce the risk of plasma TB > 5mg/dL, DB \u2265 2mg/dL, ALP > 900 IU/L, and TG > 3.4 mmol/L during hospitalization. SMOF has better lipid tolerance, reduces the incidence of PNAC and MBDP, and exerts more benefits in preterm infants with gestational age < 28 weeks.\nEuropean Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2023) 77:823\u2013832; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41430-023-01288-6"

ILE ensures proper weight gain in premature infants, provides essential fatty acids and energy, promotes the development of brain nerves and retina, reduces the related complications of premature infants, and improves the success rate of rescue [1]. However, long-term PN can lead to serious complications, such as metabolic disorder, catheter-related bloodstream infection, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, lateonset sepsis (LOS), gastrointestinal mucosal atrophy, and flora imbalance [2], also includes parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis (PNAC). The incidence of PNAC is between 25% and 60% among children who receive long-term PN as reported [3]. PNAC can develop into liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, liver failure, and even death without prompt treatment. In the 1960s, Professor Wretlind of Sweden developed a fat emulsion based on soybean oil [4], known as the traditional soybean oil fat emulsion Intralipid. It contains lots of omega-6 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (\u03c9-6 LCPUFAs) and phytosterols, which are important causes of PNAC [5]. Intralipid is presently gradually replaced by medium chain triglycerides/long chain triglycerides (MCT/LCT), olive oil (OO), and soybean oil-medium chain triglycerides-olive oil-fish oil (SMOF). MCT/LCT, composed of 50% MCT and 50% LCT mixed physically, is widely used in China. LCT provides essential fatty acids. MCT can be rapidly metabolized into lipids, with no need for carnitine to transport to mitochondria, which can reduce lipid peroxidation and intrahepatic cholestasis [6]. Therefore, the Guidelines for Clinical Application of Neonatal nutritional support in China (2013) [7] recommend the use of 20% fat emulsion (grade A evidence) in PN support of preterm infants, and MCT/LCT was reported to be better than LCT (Grade B evidence). In 2016, SMOF was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in the United States as an equivalent alternative to Intralipid (Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Deerfield, IL) [8]. Recently, SMOF has been used frequently clinically. It is a new fat emulsion composed of 30% soybean oil, 30% MCT, 25% OO, and 15% fish oil and is rich in antioxidant vitamin E (200mg/L) and \u03b1-tocopherol. It has a good balanced fatty acid pattern and ideal \u03c9-6/\u03c9-3 ratio (2.5:1) [6]. SMOF combines the advantages of a variety of oils, and currently, it is considered to be an \u201cideal\u201d fat emulsion. However, it is still controversial whether SMOF is superior to MCT/LCT. Therefore, we hypothesized that administration of SMOF among VPI and VLBWI could improve the clinical outcomes during hospitalization, especially reducing the incidence of PNAC."

The lipid emulsions used for preterm neonates in NICU were MCT/LCT (20% Lipofundin MCT/LCT, B. Braun Melsungen AG, Germany) and SMOF (20% mixed oil fat injection, Fresenius kabi asutria GmbH, Austria). The composition of the two kinds of fat emulsion is shown in Table 1. The initial dose of lipid emulsion was 1.0 g/kg/d, and the dose was gradually increased to 3.0\u20133.5 g/kg/d. When TG > 2.26mmol/L, the fat emulsion was reduced by half when TG > 2.26mmol/L, and when TG > 3.4 mmol/L, the use of fat emulsion was suspended until clearance. The initial dose of amino acids was 1\u20132 g/kg/d, and gradually increased to 3.0\u20134.0 g/kg/d. The glucose infusion rate was started at 4\u20138mg/kg/min and was adjusted according to the blood glucose levels; the maximum was no more than 11\u201314mg/kg/min. Fat-and water-soluble vitamins were added to the nutrient solution. The feeding protocol was to introduce breast milk soon after birth; breast milk was the first choice. Usually, breast milk/preterm formula was started from trophic feeding 10mL/kg/day for 3\u20135 days and subsequently advanced to a feeding amount of 10\u201320mL/kg/day.

            "text": "\u03c9-6 and \u03c9-3 LCPUFAs are essential fatty acids and important components of the cell membrane. \u03c9-6 LCPUFAs, represented by linoleic acid, \u03b3-linoleic acid, and arachidonic acid (ARA), have been shown to increase the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decrease oxidative stress injury [21, 22]. \u03c9-3 LCPUFAs, such as \u03b1linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are commonly interconverted to antiinflammatory mediators, which have liver-protective properties and anti-inflammatory effects [22, 23]. \u03c9-9 monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) are represented by oleic acid in olive oil; which are less susceptible to lipid peroxidation than polyunsaturated fatty acids [24]. Therefore, the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) stated that \u03c9-6 LCPUFAs are proinflammatory, \u03c9-3 LCPUFAs are anti-inflammatory, and \u03c9-9 MUFAs are immune neutral and recommended that the optimal ratio of \u03c9-6: \u03c9-3 LCPUFAs in immune regulation is 1-4:1 [25]. Although the ratio of \u03c9-6:\u03c9-3 in MCT/LCT lipid is 7:1, the reduced content of unsaturated double bonds is attributed to the increase in MCT by 50%, which play a major role in reducing lipid peroxidation and intrahepatic cholestasis [6]. SMOF lipid is a balanced mixture of MCTs, soybean oil, olive oil, and fish oils at ratios of 30%, 30%, 25%, and 15%, respectively, and is rich in antioxidant vitamin E (200mg/L) and \u03b1-tocopherol, with an optimum \u03c9-6:\u03c9-3 ratio and physiologic fatty acid composition [5]. Compared with traditional soybean oil, mixed oil emulsions, such as SMOF (containing fish oil) or MCT/LCT (without fish oil), display better short-and longterm benefits for preterm infants [26, 27]. Thus, the guidelines released by ESPGHAN/ESPEN/ESPR/CSPEN in 2018 strongly recommend that pure Soybean oil ILEs should no longer be used and\nEuropean Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2023) 77:823 \u2013 832\ncomposite ILEs with or without fish oil should be the first-choice treatment in preterm and term neonates with PN lasting longer than a few days [28]. However, only a few prospective comparative studies are available on MCT/LCT and SMOF lipids. The univariate analysis revealed that compared with the MCT/LCT group, the proportion of TB\uff1e5 mg/dL (84/231 [36.4%] vs. 60/234 [25.6%], P= 0.012) and DB\u2265 2mg/dL (26/231 [11.3%] vs. 14/234 [6.0%], P= 0.043) were lower in the SMOF group. In children with GA of less than 28 weeks, the prevalence of PNAC was less in the MCT/ LCT group (P= 0.043), whereas no statistically significant difference was observed between MCT/LCT with SMOF groups in children with GA> 28 weeks (P= 0.177). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that PNAC was less prevalent in the SMOF group than that in the MCT/LCT group (aRR: 0.38, 95% CI: 0.20\u20130.70, P= 0.002). It is suggested that SMOF can reduce the peak level of bilirubin in VPI or VLBWI and decrease the prevalence of PNAC by about one-third, especially in extremely premature infants (EPIs) whose GA< 28 weeks. PNAC is closely related to the use of amino acids and fat emulsion, the duration of PN, and the implementation of EN [29]. No significant difference was observed between the two groups in the time of amino acids, fat emulsion starting and reaching 3.0 g/ kg/d, the duration of PN in the time of starting EN, breastfeeding, and reaching the total enteral feeding (all P> 0.05). SMOF has been confirmed to be safe in VPI/VLBWI, with liver-protective properties that can reduce the incidence of PNAC. Kasirer et al. [30] reported that the incidence of PNAC in VLBWI in the SMOF group was lower (6% vs. 13%; P= 0.022), and the peak level of DB was lower (3.2 vs. 7.1mg/dL; P= 0.018), which was consistent with the results of this study. SMOF can reduce the incidence of PNAC, which is primarily attributed to the fact that SMOF is a mixed oil, with an optimum \u03c96:\u03c9-3 ratio (2.5:1), which is the closest to that present in breast milk (2:1). In addition, \u03c9-3 LCPUFAs have anti-inflammatory properties and liver-protective effects; olive oil is rich in oleic acid, belongs to \u03c9-9 MUFAs, which are less susceptible to lipid peroxidation than polyunsaturated fatty acids [24]. Additionally, SMOF contains less phytosterol and higher doses of vitamin E and \u03b1-tocopherol, which have anti-inflammatory and antioxidation properties. Preterm infants are at a higher risk for hypertriglyceridemia than term neonates due to the lack of adequate muscle and fat reserves, which accounts for a reduced hydrolytic capacity of the lipoprotein lipase enzyme [31]. We found that the proportion of preterm infants with TG < 2.26mmol/L in the SMOF group was higher (192/231 [83.1%] vs. 214/234 [91.5%], P= 0.007) and TG > 3.4 mmol/L was lower (13/231 [5.6%] vs. 4/234 [1.7%] P= 0.024). Pereira-da-Silva et al. [32] reported that the level of\nTG was significantly higher in the MCT/LCT group than in the SMOF group (181mg/dL vs. 134mg/dL, P= 0.006), which is consistent with our findings. This can be explained by the levels of \u03c9-3 LCPUFAs in SMOF, which have been shown to accelerate the clearance of chylomicrons, thereby effectively reducing the concentration of serum triglycerides [33] and increasing triglyceride clearance and reducing adipogenesis by inhibiting the steroid response element binding protein-1 [34]. We further identified that SMOF improved lipid tolerance of VPI and VLBWI. Additionally, the dose of amino acids and lipid for PN recommend by Guidelines for Clinical Application of Neonatal Nutritional Support in China (2013) [7], is widely used in Chinese NICUs, which is more conservative than the dose recommend by the ESPGHAN/ESPEN/ ESPR/CSPEN guidelines [28]. Thus, the applicability of our results may be limited in some regions where ESPGHAN/ESPEN/ESPR/ CSPEN guidelines are prevalent. MBDP is a kind of systemic bone disease caused by the deficiency of calcium, phosphorus, and matrix Gla protein (MGP). It is also known as the disorder of bone mentalism in premature infants, characterized by the decreased bone mineral content and incomplete mineralization of osteoid [35]. It is one of the common complications in premature infants; the incidence of MBDP increases with younger GA and lower BW. The prevalence of MBDP is as high as 32% and 54% in VLBWI and extremely low birth weight infants (ELBWI), respectively [36]. In this study, ALP > 900 IU/L and P < 1.8 mmol/L were used to diagnose MBDP, with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 71% [18]. The results showed that the proportion of infants with ALP > 900 IU/L was higher in the MCT/LCT group (17/231 [7.4%] vs. 7/234 [3.0%], P= 0.033). Univariate analysis showed that the incidence of MBDP had an increasing trend (RR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.50\u20130.91, P= 0.051), and in the subgroups with GA < 28 weeks, the incidence of MBDP in the SMOF group was significantly lower than that in the MCT/ LCT group (RR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.38\u20130.58, P= 0.029), whereas in multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the incidence of MBDP in the SMOF group was lower (aRR: 0.12, 95% CI: 0.19\u20130.81, P= 0.029), suggesting that SMOF reduced the incidence of MBDP by about two-third, and benefitted more in EPI. This is a novel finding being reported in this study. Skourolakou et al. [37] reported that the ALP level of the SMOF group was lower and P level was higher than that of soybean oil group at discharge; however, Tomsits et al. [31] and D\u2019Ascenzo et al. [38] reported that the use of SMOF fat emulsion did not improve the level of ALP and P.

Considering that PN duration is a risk factor for MBDP [39], different PN may lead to inconsistent results. In this study, the effect of PN duration was assessed because the median durations of PN in the two groups were 25 days and 26 days, respectively (P= 0.076), which was basically the same. It has been reported that \u03c9-3 and \u03c9-6 LCPUFAs have opposing effects on osteoclastofenesis. The \u03c9-6 LCPUFAs can enhance osteocalcin(OC) activity by down-regulating the ratio of osteoprotegerin to receptor activator for nuclear-factor \u03ba\u03b2 ligand (RANKL) gene expression in osteoblasts [40]. In addition, it promotes bone marrow-derived pluripotent human mesenchymal stem cells to differentiate into adipocytes rather than osteoblasts [40]. On the contrary, \u03c9-3 LCPUFAs, such as DHA, inhibit osteoclasts by downregulating the expression of the RANKL gene and also the differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells to osteoblasts rather than adipocytes [41]. Furthermore, \u03c9-3 LCPUFAs may reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, increase the release of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and improve calcium accretion in bone [41, 42]. In addition, PNAC increases the risk of MBDP [39]. Cholestasis can lead to the decrease of cholate secretion, resulting in malabsorption of fat and fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, K [43]. Vitamin D plays an important role in regulating the metabolism of calcium and phosphorus and ensuring bone health [44]. Both OC and MGP are\nvitamin K-dependent proteins; they require the participation of vitamin K to conduct \u03b3-carboxylation and bioactivity, thus, increasing bone mineralization [45]. Simultaneously, vitamins D and K have a synergistic effect on promoting bone mineralization [44]. Therefore, the deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins D and K caused by PNAC may lead to poor bone mineralization, resulting in an increased risk of MBDP. However, the exact mechanism is still unclear and needs further study on the relationship between lipid emulsion and bone metabolism. It remains controversial whether SMOF is superior to other complications of premature infants. Persistent oxidative stress and inflammatory are common key factors leading to BPD, ROP, LOS and other complications of premature infants. SMOF contains an optimal ratio of \u03c9-6/\u03c9-3 LCPUFAs (2.5:1); in addition, it is rich in \u03b1-tocopherol, which has anti-inflammatory, antioxidation, and immune-regulatory effects. Animal models showed that \u03c9-3 LCPUFAs in fish oil could reduce intestinal inflammation and improve the systemic immune response by regulating the intestinal flora [46, 47]. Thus, we speculate that SMOF may reduce the prevalence of BPD, ROP, LOS, and NEC. A randomized, double-blind, controlled study by Hsiao et al. [48] reported that the level of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 in the serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in the intervention group (SMOF) were significantly lower than those in the control group (MCT/LCT) (P< 0.05), and the prevalence of BPD was significantly lower in the\nTable 4.

However, Torgalkar et al. [27]and Repa et al.[49] did not find that the application of SMOF reduced the prevalence of BPD in ELBWI and VLBWI. A small sample study by Lin et al. [50] showed no significant difference in the incidence of BPD, ROP, PDA, LOS, IVH, PVL, EUGR, and NEC between MCT/LCT and SMOF groups in ELBWI. Yang et al. [51]compared SMOF with MCT/LCT, and the incidence of PDA, sepsis, IVH, and NEC was similar in the two groups. Certain studies have reported that early complications of premature infants have certain effects on PNAC and MBDP [10, 29, 35]. In this study, no significant difference was observed in the incidence of early\ncomplications such as BPD, ROP, PDA, NEC, IVH, PVL, EUGR, FI, and LOS between the two groups. It was further verified that SMOF reduced the risk of PNAC and MBDP. These inconsistent results may be related to the sample size, subjects, the dosage of fat emulsion, the duration of PN, the nursing level of NICU, and the interaction of other diseases. The current evidence is insufficient to determine whether SMOF has advantages in reducing BPD, ROP, and other complications of premature infants. According to the literature review, this study is the largest prospective multicenter randomized controlled study comparing MCT/LCT and SMOF, with large sample size and reliable data. Since\nEuropean Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2023) 77:823 \u2013 832\nthe five centers are distributed in 5 different provinces of China, their treatment populations may be reprensentative. It provides reliable evidence for optimizing the application of PN in premature infants. However, the study has certain limitations. Firstly, the study lacked a double-blind design because the consideration is that the use of intravenous fat emulsion should be adjusted according to the blood index of neonates to ensure medical safety. Secondly, the analysis of MBDP did not consider the dose and administration mode of Ca, P, and vitamin D supplementation between the two groups. In addition, MBDP was a secondary outcome and the sample size was not calculated to evaluate differences in incidence of MBDP, which needs further research to confirm. Thirdly, the PN protocol used in this study does not follow the ESPGHAN/ESPEN/ESPR/CSPEN 2018 guidelines, which may limit the generalizability of the study\u2019s findings. Previous studies have demonstrated that SMOF can improve the long-term neurocognitive function of preterm infants [27, 52]. Follow-up will be conducted to further confirm the benefits of using SMOF."

Thus, SMOF has better lipid tolerance, can reduce the prevalence of PNAC and MBDP, and exerts more benefits in EPI."
