1. **Investigate the role of HMGCR, SULT2A1, and ABCG5 in the regulation of bile acid metabolism in cholestasis.** This could be done by studying the expression and activity of these genes and proteins in different models of cholestasis, as well as by performing functional studies to determine how these genes and proteins affect bile acid metabolism.


2. **Explore the potential of CR as a therapeutic agent for cholestasis.** This could be done by conducting clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CR in patients with cholestasis. Additionally, animal studies could be conducted to investigate the long-term effects of CR on cholestasis and to identify potential biomarkers of response to CR.


3. **Investigate the role of the gut microbiome in the development and progression of cholestasis.** This could be done by studying the composition and function of the gut microbiome in patients with cholestasis, as well as by performing animal studies to determine how the gut microbiome affects the development and progression of cholestasis.


4. **Develop new animal models of cholestasis that more accurately recapitulate the human disease.** This could be done by using genetic engineering techniques to create animal models with specific mutations that are known to cause cholestasis in humans. Additionally, animal models could be developed that are more representative of the different types of cholestasis that occur in humans.


5. **Investigate the role of inflammation in the development and progression of cholestasis.** This could be done by studying the expression of inflammatory genes and proteins in different models of cholestasis, as well as by performing functional studies to determine how inflammation affects the development and progression of cholestasis.
