Introduction\nAzaphilones, predominantly originating from fungi, especially the Ascomycetes phylum, are an assembly of naturally occurring fungal polyketide metabolites (Zeng et\u00a0al., 2023). With a highly oxygenated and bicyclic core structure, they are accented with various functional groups. Their core structure includes two features, a pyranoquinone bicyclic component known as isochrome and a quaternary chiral center of R or S stereochemistry (Gao et\u00a0al., 2013; Wang et\u00a0 al., 2018; Chen et\u00a0 al., 2020; Wang et\u00a0 al., 2020). Exhibiting considerable structural diversity, azaphilones are characterized by modifications made to their core structures and variations in side-chain substitutions (Chen et\u00a0 al., 2016). While some azaphilones possess elaborate side chains that diversify the core skeleton, others introduce"

The structural versatility inherent to azaphilones equips them with a wide array of biological functionalities, encompassing antimicrobial, antifungal, cytotoxic, and anti-inflammatory activities among others. This wide-ranging biological activity profile accentuates their potential applicability within the realms of antiviral and anticancer therapeutics (Pavesi et\u00a0al., 2021).\nAs belonging to the Chaetomiaceae family, the genus Chaetomium with over 400 species has emerged as an important reservoir for novel bioactive metabolites. Long-term chemistry studies on Chaetomium species have shed light on the extensive structural diversity and remarkable bioactivity potential of specialized metabolites. To date, this genus has reported to produce over 500 unique natural compounds, inclusive of azaphilones, cytochalasans, pyrones, alkaloids, diketopiperazines, anthraquinones, polyketides, and steroids (Rao et\u00a0al., 2023). For example, a bioassay-guided isolation of the endophytic C. globosum yielded twelve specialized metabolites, including six azaphilones (Qi et\u00a0al., 2020). Chaetomugilins D and J, azaphilone derivatives isolated from the same species, displayed suppression of lettuce seed germination and inhibited root and shoot growth, hinting at their herbicidal capabilities (Piyasena et\u00a0 al., 2015). Nitrogenous azaphilones, sourced from indoor air-derived fungus C. globosum DAOM 240359, displayed antibacterial properties against Pseudomonas putida and Bacillus subtilis (McMullin et\u00a0al., 2013). Chaetomugilides A \u2212 C, along with three known compounds isolated from C. globosum TY1, demonstrated cytotoxic behavior against the HepG2 cancer cell line (Li et\u00a0al., 2013). Two previously unknown azaphilone alkaloid dimers, chaetofusins A and B, were isolated from the endophytic fungus C. fusiforme obtained from liverwort (Peng et\u00a0al., 2012).\nAmong the reported azaphilones, chaetoviridins stand out as a distinct subclass, synthesized by the Chaetomium genus of fungi (Yang et\u00a0al., 2021). In 1990, Takahashi et\u00a0al. (1990) firsly elucidated the structure of chaetoviridin A featuring the (4\u2019S, 5\u2019R) syn aldol side chain, and then subsequently facilitated the structural\nassignment of other epimers. Makrerougras et\u00a0al. (2017), however, subsequently modified the stereochemistry at the C-4\u2032 and C-5\u2032 positions of chaetoviridin A to (4\u2019R, 5\u2019R), achieved via the complete synthesis of (4\u2019R, 5\u2019R)-chaetoviridin A and its associated epimers. As a part of an ongoing pursuit for bioactive natural compounds from marine-derived fungi, Chaetomium globosum 2020HZ23 (Figure\u00a01) was unearthed as an endophyte of the marine brown algae, Sargassum thunbergii. Utilizing a combination of spectroscopic methods as well as DFT calculation, the characterization of three distinct secondary metabolites was carried out. As a result, two new azaphilones, namely N-butyl-2-aza-2deoxychaetoviridin A (1) and N-hexyl-2-aza-2-deoxychaetoviridin A (2), alongside the chaetoviridin A (3) with a biogenetic relation, were characterized (Figure\u00a0 2). The new compounds were then subjected to cytotoxic activity testing toward the A549 cancer cell line to evaluate their potential use as anticancer agents. The results indicated that the new azaphilones 1 and 2 demonstrated significant cytotoxicity and inhibited cell migration. Herein we\u00a0 report the isolation, structural elucidation, and cytotoxic assessment of the newly-discovered azaphilones."

Structural similarities between 1 and the co-isolated chaetoviridin A (3) were noted from the spectral data, with both compounds possessing a tricyclic core with two side chains, an aldol group and a methyl-branched pentenyl. The most noticeable differences were observed in the chemical shifts of C-1 (from \u03b4C 151.6\u00a0 in 3 to \u03b4C 141.5\u00a0in 1) and C-3 (from \u03b4C 157.0\u00a0in 3 to \u03b4C 147.2\u00a0in 1). Moreover, four extra resonances in compound 1, indicative of a butyl unit, were observed. Given the chemical shifts for C-1 and C-3 and the overall molecular weight, a nitrogen atom was postulated at the 2 position, bearing a butyl group. This inference was supported by COSY correlations of H2-1\u201d/H2-2\u201d/H2-3\u201d/H3-4\u2033 and HMBC correlations of H2-1\u2033 with C-1 and C-3 (Figure\u00a0 3). The E configuration of the C-9-C-10 double bond was determined via 3JH9-H10 (15.4) (Table\u00a01). The absolute configurations at C-4\u2032, C-5\u2032, and C-11 were established as 4\u2019R, 5\u2019R, 11S, based on NMR data comparison with the co-isolated 3, as well as the four previously synthesized chaetoviridin A epimers (Makrerougras et\u00a0 al., 2017), considering the same biosynthetic pathway. To determine the stereochemistry of C-7, we\u00a0conducted ECD calculations on the simplified structures of (7S)-1 (1a) and (7R)-1 (1b), which resulted in the assignment of the C-7 position as S (Figure\u00a04). Additionally, the negative CE at approximately 380 nm was attributed to the electron transition from MO83 (HOMO) to MO84 (LUMO) (Figure\u00a05), in alignment with the ECD spectrum of chaetoviridin A reported by Steyn and Vleggaar (1976), as well as the nitrogenated azaphilones reported by Wang et\u00a0 al. (2020). Consequently, we\u00a0identified the compound 1 as N-butyl-2-aza-2deoxychaetoviridin A.\nCompound 2, procured as a dark red solid, was assigned a molecular formula of C29H38ClNO5 through HRESIMS analysis. The chlorine atom was also authenticated through the isotopic peak observation of [M + H]+:[M + H + 2]+ at a 3:1 ratio. Additionally, 13C, DEPT, and HSQC spectra were utilized, which revealed the presence of one disubstituted double bond (\u03b4C 119.1 and 149.4), two trisubstituted double bonds (\u03b4C 147.3 and 111.3; \u03b4C 141.6 and 111.5), two tetrasubstituted double bonds (\u03b4C 145.0 and 99.9; \u03b4C 123.1 and 168.6), one ester carbonyl carbon (\u03b4C 168.6), and two keto carbons (\u03b4C 181.1 and 201.8) (Table\u00a0 1). Structural similarities between 2 and the co-isolated 3 were observed in the spectral data. Both compounds possess a tricyclic core with two side chains, an aldol group, and a methyl-branched pentenyl. Upon comparing the NMR data of 2 to that of 1, it was noted that they share the same stereogenic centers, while differences manifest in the side chain attached to N-2. The presence of two additional carbon resonances compared to 1, along with COSY correlations of H2-1\u201d/H2-2\u2019/H2-3\u201d/ H2-4\u201d/H2-5\u201d/H3-6\u2033 and HMBC correlations of H2-1\u201d/C-1 and H21\u201d/C-3, confirmed the attachment of a hexyl group to N-2 (Figure\u00a03). Consequently, following further 2D NMR analysis, the structure of 2 was ascertained to be\u00a0 N-hexyl-2-aza-2deoxychaetoviridin A.\nCompound 3 was ascertained as chaetoviridin A through the comparison of NMR data with those documented in existing literature (Park et\u00a0al., 2005)."
