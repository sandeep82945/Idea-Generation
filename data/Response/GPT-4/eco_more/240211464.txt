Exploring Variations in Weight Assignments: Future research could investigate different methodologies for assigning weights to players within network games. This could include exploring the impact of dynamic weight adjustments based on players' performance, changes in network topology, or the introduction of external factors such as market conditions or regulatory changes. Understanding how these variations affect the allocation of the weighted Myerson value could provide deeper insights into the fairness and efficiency of network game outcomes.

Integrating Machine Learning for Optimal Bidding Strategies: Leveraging machine learning algorithms to develop predictive models that can simulate and optimize bidding strategies in the non-cooperative framework presented could be a significant area of research. This approach could help in understanding the complexities of strategic interactions in network games and potentially lead to the development of automated systems that can negotiate and form coalitions with minimal human intervention.

Extension to Multilayer Networks: Research could be extended to multilayer networks, where players participate in multiple interconnected networks simultaneously. This extension would involve developing allocation rules that consider the multidimensional contributions of players across different layers and how these contributions influence their overall worth and the allocation they receive. This would be particularly relevant in complex systems like global supply chains or multi-platform digital ecosystems.

Analyzing the Role of Network Structure in Value Allocation: Future studies could focus on how different network structures (such as scale-free networks, random networks, or small-world networks) influence the allocation of the weighted Myerson value. This research could uncover the significance of network topology in determining the fairness and efficiency of allocations and how strategic formations of network links can influence individual and collective payoffs.

Developing Governance Mechanisms for Network Games: Investigating governance mechanisms that can be implemented in network games to ensure equitable and sustainable outcomes. This could involve creating regulatory frameworks or incentive schemes that encourage players to act in ways that enhance overall network value, reduce inequalities in allocation, and mitigate the risks of monopolistic control or exploitation within the network.
