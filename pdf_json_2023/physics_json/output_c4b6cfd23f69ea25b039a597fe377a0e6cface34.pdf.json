    "abstractText": "This study investigates the effects, conversions, and resistance induction, following the addition of 150 \u03bcg\u00b7L 1 of two antibiotics, sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and trimethoprim (TMP), in a laboratory-scale micro-aerated anaerobic membrane bioreactor (MA-AnMBR). TMP and SMX were removed at 97 and 86%, indicating that micro-aeration did not hamper their removal. These antibiotics only affected the pH and biogas composition of the process, with a significant change in pH from 7.8 to 7.5, and a decrease in biogas methane content from 84 to 78%. TMP was rapidly adsorbed onto the sludge and subsequently degraded during the long solids retention time of 27 days. SMX adsorption was minimal, but the applied hydraulic retention time of 2.6 days was sufficiently long to biodegrade SMX. The levels of three antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs) (sul1, sul2, and dfrA1) and one mobile genetic element biomarker (intI1) were analyzed by qPCR. Additions of the antibiotics increased the relative abundances of all ARGs and intI1 in the MA-AnMBR sludge, with the sul2 gene folding 15 times after 310 days of operation. The MA-AnMBR was able to reduce the concentration of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) in the permeate by 3 log.",

TMP and SMX were removed at 97 and 86%, indicating that micro-aeration did not hamper their removal. These antibiotics only affected the pH and biogas composition of the process, with a significant change in pH from 7.8 to 7.5, and a decrease in biogas methane content from 84 to 78%. TMP was rapidly adsorbed onto the sludge and subsequently degraded during the long solids retention time of 27 days. SMX adsorption was minimal, but the applied hydraulic retention time of 2.6 days was sufficiently long to biodegrade SMX. The levels of three antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs) (sul1, sul2, and dfrA1) and one mobile genetic element biomarker (intI1) were analyzed by qPCR. Additions of the antibiotics increased the relative abundances of all ARGs and intI1 in the MA-AnMBR sludge, with the sul2 gene folding 15 times after 310 days of operation.

            "text": "Water demand has been increasing worldwide due to changes in consumption patterns, socioeconomic development, and population growth. Water consumption is expected to rise above one-quarter of the current consumption level by 2050 (WWAP 2019). The use of treated wastewater has risen as a possibility to alleviate water scarcity caused by water stress (Saidan et al. 2020). Nevertheless, to reclaim treated water, wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) should be able to provide high-quality effluents. Most conventional WWTPs are not designed for the removal of antibiotics (Radjenovic et al. 2007;\n/article-pdf/doi/10.2166/wst.2023.324/1323027/wst2023324.pdf\nDownloaded fr by guest on 12 January\nGros et al. 2010) and only minimal removal of pharmaceutical compounds can be observed in the primary treatment of wastewater (i.e., by coagulation, flocculation, and sedimentation) (Oulton et al. 2010).\nAntibiotics are important components of human and veterinary medicines. Their consumption is increasing daily, leading to their occurrence in residual waters, such as municipal wastewater and urban and rural run-off. As much as 90% of the consumed antibiotics are excreted without any change in composition or functionality (Balakrishna et al. 2017). Among the available antibiotics, sulfamethoxazole (SMX, C10H11N3O3S) and trimethoprim (TMP, C14H18N4O3) are found in significantly high concentrations all over the world, as these are some of the most commonly used antibiotics in human and veterinary medications (van Boeckel et al. 2014). Sim et al. (2011) found high concentrations of SMX and TMP in WWTPs treating wastewater from the pharmaceutical industry, with maximum values reaching 309 and 162 \u03bcg L 1, respectively.\nAntibiotics can be removed or transformed by either biotic (biodegradation) or abiotic (sorption, ion exchange, complex formation with metal ions, and polar hydrophilic interactions) processes (D\u0131\u00b4az-Cruz et al. 2003; Michael et al. 2013). On the majority of WWTPs, the sorption and biodegradation of antibiotics occur in parallel. Pharmaceuticals can be biodegraded under aerobic, anoxic or anaerobic conditions, or in combination of all conditions, depending on the antibiotic. The centrally positioned amide group in SMX prevents its degradation under aerobic conditions. However, under anaerobic conditions it can be degraded by reductive cleavage of the molecule due to the adjacently located strong electron-withdrawing sulfonyl group. In the case of TMP, the substituted pyrimidine group can be readily biotransformed under anaerobic conditions (Alvarino et al. 2018). Figure 1 shows the chemical structure of SMX and TMP. Furthermore, the sorption potential of antibiotics is highly dependent on their molecular charge, polarity, and hydrophobicity, among other characteristics. Hydrophobic antibiotics have a great affinity to solid particles and therefore, have higher chances of being sorbed to sludge particles and reside long in the process to get degraded. The sorption capacity of antibiotics can be described as low, medium, or high, depending on their octanol-water partition coefficient (KOW). High sorption is linked to log KOW values above 4, while low sorption can be considered for antibiotics with log KOW values below 0.25 (Rogers 1996). SMX and TMP properties are presented in Table 1.\nThe persistence of antibiotics in WWTPs and waterbodies can lead microbial communities to acquire antibiotic resistance. The O\u2019Neill report (O\u2019Neill 2014), commissioned by the United Kingdom government, predicts that by 2050, antibiotic-resistant infections will lead to 10 million annual deaths, with associated costs above 100 trillion USD. Furthermore, the World Health Organization established that the multi-resistance gained by bacteria is alarming and threatens global public health\nom http://iwaponline.com/wst/article-pdf/doi/10.2166/wst.2023.324/1323027/wst2023324.pdf 2024\nAdapted from NCBI (N. C. f. B. I. NCBI US Government) and Alvarino et al. (2018). KOW is the octanol\u2013water partition coefficient and refers to the sorption capacity of antibiotics. The antibiotics removal pathways refer to the preferential ones, being either aerobic or anaerobic, and biodegraded or adsorbed. Positive (\u00fe) or negative ( ) charge is based on pH between 7 and 9.\nDownloaded from http by guest on 12 January 2024\n(World Health Organization 2015). Wastewater catchment areas and WWTPs are considered one of the major points of antibiotic resistance release into the environment (K\u00fcmmerer 2009; Czekalski et al. 2012). Wastewater carries the complex cocktails of chemicals and biological contaminants released from anthropogenic activities. The high density of microbes in WWTPs has been frequently hypothesized to promote the transfer of antibiotic resistance via vertical and horizontal gene transfer in the presence of the antibiotics or other chemicals (Zarei-Baygi et al. 2019). The non-resistant bacteria can gain the resistance mechanisms from the antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) via an exchange of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) like plasmids, integrons, and transposons, that contains antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs) (Blair et al. 2015). Previous research indicated that the high solids retention times (SRTs) of WWTPs can result in an increased abundance of ARGs in conventional and membrane-based activated sludge systems (Xiao et al. 2017; Zhang et al. 2018).\nMembrane bioreactors (MBRs) are potentially effective for treating pharmaceutical wastewater containing various antibiotics and other micropollutants (Oberoi et al. 2019). The long SRT and ultrafiltration (UF) membrane pore size are the main determining parameters for antibiotics removal in MBRs (Ji et al. 2020). Several authors found that the optimum SRT for enhanced antibiotics removal was around 30 days (Tadkaew et al. 2010; Xia et al. 2015; Nguyen et al. 2017). Due to its great affinity to solids, hydrophobic antibiotics can sorb to the sludge particles and then be subjected to biodegradation. The high SRT in MBRs promotes a diverse enzymatic activity due to the manifestation of slowly growing bacteria, which in parallel may support the degradation of the antibiotics (G\u00f6bel et al. 2007; Le-Minh et al. 2010).\nWhether antibiotics are degraded via aerobic, anoxic or anaerobic conversion pathways, determines the need to apply a specific treatment technique, or treatments that combine both redox conditions. In our previous work, we researched the feasibility of a laboratory-scale micro-aerated (MA) AnMBR, mimicking a fullscale digester equipped with a dissolved air flotation DAF unit for sludge retention instead of a membrane unit (Piaggio et al. 2023\u20132024). Results showed improved hydrolysis and negligible effects of the micro-aeration on operation and maintenance of the system. However, thus far, the removal of antibiotics and specifically SMX and TMP in an MA-AnMBR, remains unclear. Depending on the compound of concern, the application of micro-aeration in an AnMBRmight impact their removal efficiency and rate. Since TMP and SMX removal is a mixture of bio-sorption and bio-conversion, the complete solids retention and high SRT provided by the MA-AnMBR system may enhance the degradation of both antibiotics. Furthermore, little is known about the effect of a membrane system on the growth and on the separation of ARB, as well as on the spreading of ARGs, in conjunction with the presence and removal of antibiotics in the wastewater.\nTherefore, this study focused on the fate of SMX and TMP, in a laboratory-scale MA-AnMBR and their effect on the presence of antibiotic resistance in the MA-AnMBR permeate. Antibiotics removal mechanisms (adsorption and/or degradation) and the effects of adding SMX and TMP to the MA-AnMBR feed on its operation and performance were assessed. Measurements of ARGs and ARB from the sludge and permeate of the MA-AnMBR were performed to further understand the complexities and risks linked to the presence of antibiotics in domestic wastewater, and to address the efficiency of MAAnMBRs to possibly contribute in reducing the spreading of antibiotic resistance from urban water systems."

The COD removal was always above 97%, with permeate COD values that varied between 50 and 90 mg\u00b7L 1. The statistical difference between the reactor parameters was assessed using ANOVA single-factor between the MA-AnMBR parameters before and during the antibiotic\u2019s addition phases (P.I and P.III).\nThe reactor pH, system average biogas production, and biogas methane concentration showed statistical differences between the values obtained at the studied phases. The sludge pH decreased from 7.8 to 7.5 after the addition of antibiotics. Furthermore, while biogas production increased from 1.4 to 2.1, the change was not significant (p-value\u00bc 0.8) due to the higher standard deviation. The biogas methane content decreased, from 84 to 78%. While the CH4 concentration decreased, the carbon dioxide biogas concentration doubled, from 7 to 16%. The increase in CO2 concentration is aligned with the decrease in the system pH. No significant differences in sludge concentration, either suspended or total, were observed. Similarly, the nutrient content in the reactor permeate (as NH\u00fe4 and PO 3 4 ) did not show statistically relevant changes after the addition of 150 \u03bcg\u00b7L 1 of SMX and TMP. Antibiotics SMX and TMP removal was assessed during phase P.II, where the antibiotics were introduced stepwise until a concentration of 150 \u03bcg\u00b7L 1 each (during a period of 40 days in total), and during phase P.III, for 120 days. During P.II, TMP concentration in the MA-AnMBR permeate remained below 10 \u03bcg\u00b7L 1, and SMX values were below 20 \u03bcg\u00b7L 1.

            "text": "Despite the addition of air in the MA-AnMBR, TMP removal was high, i.e., 97+ 1%. A similar TMP removal of around 94% was obtained in a laboratory-scale AnMBR-treated synthetic sewage (Xiao et al. 2017). Feng et al. (2017) have found that TMP removal during pig manure digestion under strict anaerobic conditions exceeded 99% after 10 days of digestion. In contrast, a TMP removal of only 26.4% has been measured from conventional activated sludge processes that are mostly operated with aerobic conditions or in alternating redox conditions (Li & Zhang 2010). Previously, the changes in AnMBR performance with and without micro-aeration had been assessed: it was concluded that the given micro-aeration (reaching an oxygen over influent COD load of 1.0%) had a negligible impact on the reactor performance (Piaggio et al. 2023\u20132024). Thus, based on the efficiency measured in the MA-AnMBR, it can be inferred that the micro-aeration of the system has a negligible effect on TMP removal, and the MA-AnMBR is efficient in the removal of this antibiotic.\nThe log Kow value of TMP and its positive charge at circumneutral pH results in quick adsorption onto the negatively charged biomass (Jia et al. 1996). Adsorption of TMP at 10 \u00b0C in batch tests showed a removal of TMP around 75% after 6 h of testing, as shown in Figure 4. In the continuous-flow MA-AnMBR, removal of TMP from the permeate reached 97%. From the results obtained in the adsorption tests, the sludge adsorption capacity for the highest TMP concentration tested (107 \u03bcg\u00b7L 1) was around 200 \u03bcg\u00b7gTSS. The MA-AnMBR has a TSS content of 6 g\u00b7L 1 and total volume of 6.5 L, resulting in a total suspended biomass of 39 g. Considering the above-mentioned adsorption capacity, the MA-AnMBR is expected to be saturated with TMP after 21 days of operation. Hereafter, if no biodegradation of TMP would have occurred, TMP would have accumulated, reaching increased concentrations. Since the overall removal of TMP in the MA-AnMBR is\n://iwaponline.com/wst/article-pdf/doi/10.2166/wst.2023.324/1323027/wst2023324.pdf\nDownloaded fr by guest on 12 January\n97%, it can be concluded that TMP was indeed degraded in the MA-AnMBR. Antibiotic concentration in the MA-AnMBR sludge was measured during P.II and P.III. The residual TMP concentration increased from P.II to P.III until it reached a plateau, with a concentration of 9+ 4 \u03bcg\u00b7L 1. Thus, TMP is quickly adsorbed onto the sludge and very likely subsequently digested. Apparently, the applied SRT of 27 days allowed enough time for the anaerobic degradation of TMP Alvarino et al. (2018), Feng et al. (2017). The removal of SMX in the MA-AnMBR was 86+ 5%. This value was in the same range, between 70 and 90%, of reported SMX removal in fully anaerobic laboratory-scale AnMBR units treating domestic wastewater (Zarei-Baygi et al. 2020; Harb et al. 2021; Oberoi et al. 2022). SMX removal in an aerobic activated sludge process has been reported to be much lower than in the MA-AnMBR, i.e., 39.1% (Li & Zhang 2010). ORP measurements showed that anaerobic conditions were kept in the MA-AnMBR even under micro-aeration, maintaining an ORP of 530 mV. While a high removal of SMX was obtained in the MA-AnMBR, batch adsorption tests at 10 \u00b0C showed SMX removal below 15% (Figure 4). The low adsorption of SMX onto the sludge is likely due to the negative charge of SMX at circumneutral pH, disfavoring its attraction to negatively charged biomass. The residual SMX concentration in the MA-AnMBR sludge was only 14+ 6 \u03bcg\u00b7L 1 during P.III.\nMost likely SMX was also degraded anaerobically in the MA-AnMBR, considering the measured removal efficiencies. With the measured low adsorption, the degradation rate of SMX is determined by the hydraulic loading rate, which resulted in an HRT of 2.6 days. The most important transformation reactions of the isoxazole ring of SMX and routes to co-metabolize SMX are hydroxylation, hydrogenation, acetylation, desulfurization, and reductive cleavage, among others (Jia et al. 2017; Tang et al. 2022). Some of the degradation pathways of SMX, like hydroxylation and desulfurization as part of acetylation, take less than 1 day, ensuring SMX degradation when HRTs, 1 day are applied (Tang et al. 2022). According to Dermer & Fuchs (2012), dehydrogenase enzymes play a key role in the hydroxylation of SMX under anaerobic conditions, and hydroxylation can be considered one of the main SMX degradation pathways. Results indicate that antibiotics like TMP, which easily adsorb to the sludge, are efficiently degraded in anaerobic reactors that are characterized by a long SRT. However, antibiotics that remain solubilized, like SMX, require a minimum HRT for efficient conversion. Regarding SMX, an HRT of 2.6 days was already sufficient for a high removal efficiency. For practical purposes, further research on optimizing HRT values is recommended. While biogas quality changes from P.I to P.III were statistically significant, no change in biogas quantity was observed. Cetecioglu et al. (2015) have shown that only concentrations above 45 mg\u00b7L 1 of SMX were lethal to the microbial community and hence, inhibit biogas production. Zarei-Baygi et al. (2020) have concluded that after the addition of 250 \u03bcg\u00b7L 1 of SMX to a laboratory-scale AnMBR fed with synthetic wastewater, the abundance of methanogens remained the same, and the microbial community of biomass was stable throughout the study. Furthermore, Tang et al. (2022) concluded that addition of up to 2 mg\u00b7L 1 of SMX was beneficial for methane production in batch experiments, which was explained by the negative impact of SMX addition on acidogenic biomass, preventing the build-up of acid intermediates and low pH. As a consequence, the time required to reach the maximum methane production was distinctly shortened."

            "text": "The results of this long-term experiment indicated potential development of antibiotic resistance in the bacterial population when antibiotics are present in the wastewaters. In the MA-AnMBR permeate, no ARB bacteria were present in days 111 and 430. The latter sampling moment was performed when the MA-AnMBR was fed with synthetic feed without antibiotics, while the samples taken on day 111 corresponded to the moment when the MA-AnMBR was fed with the synthetic feed and 150 \u03bcg\u00b7L 1 of TMP. ARB measurements performed after day 111 showed an increase in both TMP and SMX relative concentrations (to the total heterotrophic bacterial count), as shown in Figure 5. The highest concentrations of TMP and SMX ARB in the UF permeate were obtained on P.III, having a relative abundance of 57 and 70%, respectively. Furthermore, TMP ARB in the MA-AnMBR bulk increased from 4% of the total heterotrophic bacteria count at P.II to 9% at P.III and finally 20% at P.IV. On the other hand, no significant difference was found in the relative abundance of the TMP and SMX ARB in the reactor bulk during the studied periods (p values of 0.3 and 0.8, respectively).\nBoth SMX- and TMP-resistant bacteria were measured in the MA-AnMBR permeate during phases P.I\u2013P.III, and relative abundances of SMX- and TMP-resistant bacteria significantly increased during P.II, while the antibiotics were being added in steps (p-value below 0.05). Moreover, no resistant bacteria were found 180 days after the dosage of antibiotics to the MA-AnMBR was stopped (day 430, P.IV). While these results might indicate the loss of resistance once the antibiotics were removed from the feed solution, ARGs for SMX were still found in abundance in the MA-AnMBR permeate in P.IV,\nom http://iwaponline.com/wst/article-pdf/doi/10.2166/wst.2023.324/1323027/wst2023324.pdf 2024\nDownloaded from http by guest on 12 January 2024\non day 311, indicating the contrary. The ARG chosen for TMP, dfrA1, was below the detection limit in all phases of permeate samples. Thus, it is advised to assess the resistance toward this antibiotic in the MA-AnMBR on the ARB count, instead of the selected ARG.\nThe permeate of the laboratory-scale MA-AnMBR is rich in nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, and has an optimal temperature for bacterial re-growth. Furthermore, it is possible that some bacteria have passed the UF membrane of the MA-AnMBR. Lousada-Ferreira et al. (2016) have found that particles 100 times bigger than the nominal pore size were found in several membranes\u2019 permeates, even when membrane integrity was not compromised, leading to their conclusion that the nominal membrane pore size given by the manufacturer is rather an indication of the average membrane pore size but might be very different from the maximum values. The genes studied in this research had a length between 300 and 600 bp (Arabi et al. 2015), which using the rule of thumb that each base pair is about one third of a nm, entitles to lengths between 100 and 300 nm. Most municipal wastewater bacteria sizes vary between 1 and 100 \u03bcm (Levine et al. 1985). Therefore, it can be hypothesized that bacteria and genes might have passed the used membrane with nominal pore size of 30 nm. Nonetheless, the determined values around 103 CFU\u00b7mL 1 for the laboratory-scale MA-AnMBR permeate represented 3 log removal of total bacteria and ARB.\nAll measured ARGs and intI1 relative abundances in the MA-AnMBR sludge and UF permeate increased during phase P.II, but only sul1 and sul2 in the sludge kept increasing during the phase P.III, as shown in Figure 6. These results are aligned with the results obtained by Guo et al. (2021), who found an increase in intI1 mobile gene element, sul1 and sul2 due to an addition of oxygen equivalent to 1% of influent COD, in a sequencing batch reactor fed with blackwater. The increase in sul1 and sul2 genes due to the addition of SMX, has also been observed by Zarei-Baygi et al. (2019) and Blahna et al. (2006). While SMX resistance genes increased during P.II and P.III, no statistical differences were found in the relative concentration of SMX-resistant bacteria and total bacteria between these phases (p-value of 0.4). Furthermore, the relative abundance of ARG in the permeate was similar to the one obtained in the sludge. Thus, while the UF membrane can retain 99.9% of the measured bacteria, the bacteria present in the permeate has a similar abundance of ARGs.\nPearson correlation tests were conducted between the measured levels of SMX-resistant bacteria and TMP-resistant bacteria, and the relative abundances of the different genes in the samples taken from the reactor bulk and the permeate of the MAAnMBR. A strong linear positive correlation was observed between TMP- and SMX-resistant bacteria in the reactor bulk and UF permeate, with \u03c1 values of 0.83 and 0.97, respectively (Supplementary material, Annex D). Thus, SMX-resistant bacteria increased simultaneously with TMP-resistant bacteria, which might be attributed to the fact that both antibiotics were added in the same experimental phase to the MA-AnMBR, with only 20 days difference between the start of dosing TMP and SMX.\nThe gene dfrA1 was positively correlated to all studied genes in the sludge samples of the MA-AnMBR. When a concentration of 10 \u03bcg\u00b7L 1 of SMX started to be added to the reactor on day 112, all studied genes reached their maximum concentration (Figure 6). Apparently, addition of SMX not only induced the concentration increase of sul1 and sul2, i.e., the genes associated with this antibiotic, but also increased other ARGs. The change in dfrA1 gene concentration could be linked to both SMX and/or TMP addition, and therefore, TMP resistance is not only linked to changes in dfrA1 concentration. Results showed that plate counting of resistant bacteria is a better method of estimation for measuring resistance toward TMP than the relative abundance of the dfrA1 gene.\nFinally, all measured relative abundances of the sul1, sul2, dfrA1, and intI1 genes decreased during phase P.IV, i.e., when the MA-AnMBR was fed without antibiotics. Thus, biological digestion in the MA-AnMBR is favorable for the reduction of ARG levels in the sludge. Several authors have stated that biological treatment and membrane systems are efficient for the removal of ARGs, especially sul1 and sul2 (Munir et al. 2011; Zarei-Baygi et al. 2019; Zheng et al. 2019). Nevertheless, considering the relative abundance of genes (vs. 16S rRNA gene copy number), the UF membrane system of the MA-AnMBR did not retain all microorganisms, and the permeate still had ARGs. Thus, while the biological treatment achieved an increased removal of ARGs, it was not efficient in retaining all microorganisms, and the UF permeate showed a similar ARGs relative abundance to the one in the reactor bulk. Thus, for the complete removal of ARB and microorganisms containing the studied ARGs, a subsequent treatment step should be implemented."

The main conclusions of the research are the following:\n\u2022 The addition of 150 \u03bcg\u00b7L 1 of SMX and TMP into the MA-AnMBR feed had negligible effects on the system performance. The sludge pH decreased from 7.8 to 7.5, which simultaneously entailed an increase in CO2 concentration in the biogas (from 7 to 16%) and a decrease in the CH4 partial pressure. These changes were statistically significant (p-value ,0.05). \u2022 A high removal of SMX and TMP was achieved in the laboratory-scale MA-AnMBR. SMX was poorly adsorbed into the sludge but rapidly degraded, reaching a total removal of 86%, measured in the MA-AnMBR permeate, relative to the influent. In contrast, TMP was rapidly adsorbed onto the MA-AnMBR sludge while the long SRT of the system guaranteed its degradation, achieving a total TMP removal of 97%. Thus, micro-aeration of the membrane system had no negative effects\non the removal of the antibiotics.\n\u2022 ARB and ARGs were found in both the MA-AnMBR sludge and permeate. No significant difference was found in the relative abundance of the TMP and SMX ARB in the reactor bulk during the studied periods. While the system was able to\nreduce the ARB concentration by 3 log, the relative ARG abundance was similar in the sludge and the UF permeate. The addition of SMX and TMP led to an increase in the relative abundance of all ARGs and intI1 in the MA-AnMBR sludge. \u2022 The relative abundance of the ARG dfrA1 in the MA-AnMBR mixed liquor had a strong linear correlation with sul1, sul2, and the MGE intI1. However, changes in relative abundance of the genes were not linked to ARB. Thus, the gain of resistance to TMP or SMX is better assessed by the heterotrophic plate count of ARB than by molecular detection of the genes. \u2022 The relative abundance of the MGE intI1 in the sludge was positively and linearly correlated with all measured genes (\u03c1 values above 0.82), reflecting the overall effect of antibiotics on the microbial gene pool."
