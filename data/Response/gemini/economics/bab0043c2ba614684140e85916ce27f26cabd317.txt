1. **Investigate the long-term impact of cash transfer UHC+ interventions on TB treatment outcomes and catastrophic cost incurrence for TB-affected households.** This study provides evidence of the acceptability of cash transfer UHC+ interventions, but further research is needed to quantify the impact of these interventions on TB treatment outcomes and catastrophic cost incurrence.
2. **Explore the feasibility and acceptability of scaling up CCTs in Vietnam.** This study found that CCTs were acceptable to beneficiaries, but district-level TB doctors and program staff perceived them as overly burdensome to administer. Further research is needed to explore the feasibility and acceptability of scaling up CCTs in Vietnam, and to identify ways to reduce the burden on the health system.
3. **Develop and evaluate interventions to improve the utilization of SHI for TB care.** This study found that beneficiaries faced barriers to SHI enrollment and utilization challenges. Further research is needed to develop and evaluate interventions to improve the utilization of SHI for TB care, and to ensure that SHI is truly achieving its goal of providing universal health coverage.
4. **Investigate the role of social support in TB care.** This study found that the regular engagement with and counselling provided by program staff was viewed as a benefit and core component of the acceptability of the intervention. Further research is needed to investigate the role of social support in TB care, and to develop and evaluate interventions to provide tailored psychosocial support to people with TB.
5. **Explore the potential of microcredit as a form of social protection for TB-affected households.** This study found that beneficiaries requested access to other forms of social protection, such as low- or no-interest loans. Further research is needed to explore the potential of microcredit as a form of social protection for TB-affected households, and to develop and evaluate interventions to provide microcredit to people with TB.
