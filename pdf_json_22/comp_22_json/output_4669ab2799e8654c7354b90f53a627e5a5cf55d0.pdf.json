Effectively control the multi-parameters of each laser beam, such as the optical phase, polarization, tip/tilt, intensity, optical path, and temporal shape (for pulsed beam) is the key factor for a coherently combined system [2]. Our research group have been teaching and investigating \u201cCoherent Beam Combining\u201d for years, and plenty of graduate student have learned or investigated this topic. It is found that coherent beam combining has proofed to be an excellent environment for multidisciplinary education and training. In this paper, by taking optical phase control as an example, we will show that the multidisciplinary knowledge could be taught to and mastered by the graduate students, which not only broaden the knowledge base for the students, but also bring good scientific research achievements."

The control strategy can also be referenced from the concept of time division multiple access (TDMA) and code division multiple access, and so on [6]."
