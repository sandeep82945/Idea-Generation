    "abstractText": "WASP-33b, a hot Jupiter around a hot star, is a rare system in which nodal precession has been discovered. We updated the model for the nodal precession of WASP-33b by adding new observational points. Consequently, we found a motion of the nodal precession spanning 11 years. We present homogenous Doppler tomographic analyses of eight datasets, including two new datasets from TS23 and HIDES, obtained between 2008 and 2019, to illustrate the variations in the projected spin-orbit obliquity ofWASP-33b and its impact parameter.We also present its impact parameters based on photometric transit observations captured by MuSCAT in 2017 and MuSCAT2 in 2018. We derived its real spin-orbit obliquity \u03c8, stellar spin inclination is , and stellar gravitational quadrupole moment J2 from the time variation models of the two orbital parameters. We obtained \u03c8 = 108.19+0.95 \u22120.97 deg, is = 58.3+4.6 \u22124.2 deg, and J2 = (1.36 +0.15 \u22120.12) \u00d7 10 \u22124. Our J2 value was slightly smaller than the theoretically predicted value, which may indicate that its actual stellar internal structure is different from the theoretical one. We derived the nodal precession speed \u00a4 \u03b8 = 0.507+0.025 \u22120.022 deg year \u22121, and its period Ppre = 709+33 \u221234 years, and found that WASP-33b transits in front of WASP-33 for only \u223c 20 % of the entire nodal precession period.",

Despite their small number, their orbital obliquities tend to have a wide range. This tendency indicates that they did not experience realignment by the tidal torque (Albrecht et al. 2012). Generally, hot host stars rotate rapidly, yielding oblateness larger than those of slowly rotating stars.\n\u2605 E-mail: n-watanabe@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp\nA misaligned orbit and a fast-rotating star force faster precession.At present, there are only two planetswhose nodal precessions have been detected: Kepler-13Ab (Szab\u00f3 et al. 2012) and WASP-33b (Johnson et al. 2015). These planets are hot Jupiters, revolving in misaligned orbits around rapidly rotating hot stars.\nWASP-33b, a hot Jupiter (\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc5d = 1.5\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc3d ) around an A-type (\ud835\udc47eff = 7430 \u00b1 100K) and rapidly rotating (\ud835\udc49 sin \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc60 = 85.6 km s\u22121) star, is the only planet whose precession has been detected byDoppler tomography based on transit spectral data. This planet was discovered by Collier Cameron et al. (2010); its nodal precession has been detected bymore than oneDoppler tomographicmeasurement (Johnson et al. 2015; Iorio 2016; Watanabe et al. 2020; Borsa et al. 2021).

(2020) within 3 \ud835\udf0e. Moreover, (Borsa et al. 2021) revealed that the change in the transit chord of WASP-33b is slightly overly complicated for hereafter estimating the position of the transit chord. Thus, we performed more additional observations and datasets to obtain more accurate values of \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc60 and \ud835\udc3d2,as well as a clearer forecasting of the transit chord. In this paper, we report the nodal precession of WASP-33b for a longer period of 11 years by considering additional Doppler tomographic measurements obtained through spectral transit and transit photometric observations. Transit photometry is an important method for measuring the impact parameter \ud835\udc4f and its change, as demonstrated by Szab\u00f3 et al. (2012), who applied this to detect the nodal precession of Kepler-13Ab using Kepler\u2019s photometric datasets. In Section 2, we present our spectral datasets for Doppler tomography and the steps for measuring the orbital parameters, i.e., \ud835\udc4f and the projected spin-orbit obliquity \ud835\udf06, the angle between the stellar spin axis and the planetary orbital axis.We explain how to handle our transit photometric datasets for determining \ud835\udc4f in Section 3. Moreover, we fit the values of these two parameters from the spectral and photometric measurements with the nodal precession model, which is described in Section 4. We display the behaviour of WASP-33b\u2019s nodal precession and the derived parameters of WASP-33b and its host star in Section 5. In Section 6, we discuss the nodal precession results. Finally, we present our conclusions in Section 7."

One of them was obtained with the High Dispersion Spectrograph (HDS; Noguchi et al. 2002) at the 8.2 m Subaru telescope on 19 October, 2011 UT. The other two datasets were obtained by the Harlan J. Smith Telescope (HJST) with the Robert G. Tull Coud\u00e9 Spectrograph (TS23; Tull et al. 1995) at McDonald Observatory on 12 November 2008 UT and 4 October 2014 UT. These datasets were also used in our previous study Watanabe et al. (2020). To extract each line profile fromeach spectrum,we adopted least-squares deconvolution (LSD; Donati et al. 1997); the observed spectrum was regarded as a convolution of a line profile and a series of delta functions. Under this method, we obtained a list of the absorption lines from the Vienna Atomic Line Database (VALD; Kupka et al. 2000) to create a series of delta functions. We then derived each line profile and the error bars with the matrix calculations in Kochukhov et al. (2010). We then have analysed three spectroscopic datasets obtained on 28 September 2016 UT, 12 January 2018 UT, and 2 January 2019 UT from the high-resolution HARPS-N spectrograph (Cosentino et al. 2012), which is mounted at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG).\nThese three datasets have been extracted and published in Borsa et al. (2021), which were used in the extracted line profile series in this study. We also We then included two aditional spectral datasets. One was an extracted dataset taken by HJST/TS23 on 11 December 2016 UT. Data from 2016 also included 10 in-transit spectra. The other datasetwas obtained from the 188 cm telescopewithHIghDispersion Echelle Spectrograph (HIDES; Izumiura 1999) at Okayama AstroComplex (OAC) in Japan on 27 December, 2019 UT. We utilized a wavelength range from 4980\u00c5 to 6220\u00c5 except for the Na D lines and wavelength regions around bad pixels. We reduced these spectral data by the subtracting bias and dark features, flat dividing, and performing one-dimensional spectrum and wavelength calibration. We then utilized their continua, as well as the HDS process. We selected alp Leo, a rapidly-rotating star (\ud835\udc49 sin \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc60 \u223c 300 km s\u22121; Abt et al. 2002), to erase the Earth\u2019s atmospheric absorption lines. We then shifted the spectra to the barycentric frame using PyRAF (Science Software Branch at STScI 2012). Finally, we extracted each line profile of each exposure using the LSD."

            "text": "We derived a median line profile from all exposure data including intransit for each epoch. We applied a median line profile, not a mean profile, because it avoided the effects of outliers. We subtracted the median line profile from each exposure line profile to calculate the time-series of the line profile residuals. Both the planetary shadow due to the transit of WASP-33b and a striped pattern due to the nonradial pulsations on the surface of WASP-33 (Collier Cameron et al. 2010) were present in the line profile residuals. Herrero et al. (2011) showed that the pulsation period was approximately 68 min based on photometric observations. However, determining the period from the Doppler tomographic results was difficult owing to the irregular patterns. To extract only the planetary shadow, we applied a Fourier filtering technique (Johnson et al. 2015) because the planet is retrograde,while the pulsations are prograde. First, we performed a two-dimensional Fourier transform. There were components derived from the pulsations in the Fourier space in the first and third quadrants, and the planetary shadow\u2019s components in the second and fourth quadrants. Second, we created a filter in which we set unity in the two diagonal quadrants, including power from the planetary shadow, and zero in the other quadrants, including power from the pulsation with a Hann function between these quadrants. Finally, we multiplied the Fourier space by the filter and performed an inverse Fourier transform on the filtered Fourier space to extract the planetary shadow. Figure 1 illustrates these procedures."

To produce the light curves of WASP-33b, aperture photometry was performed using the pipeline proposed by Fukui et al. (2011). This process determines the stellar barycentre in every frame. We used BD+36 488, the second brightest star image in the frame, as a companion star to correct the atmospheric extinction. Next, the pipeline calculated the shift in the stellar position relative to the reference frame. This approach photometers the target star and a comparison star with a fixed aperture radius. Here, we set the aperture radii to 36 and 40 pixels for MuSCAT and MuSCAT2, respectively. After the sky background in the torus area centred on the stellar barycentr, the pipeline subtracted the sky background from WASP33b\u2019s flux and that of the comparison. Finally, the WASP-33b light curve was obtained by dividing its flux by the comparison star flux."

This is the first study to verify the nodal precession based on both Doppler tomographic observatioadds and transit photometry. The errors from the transit photometric observations were large. However, with the change in the impact parameter (see the left bottom part in Figure 6), the results from the transit photometry were consistent with the predicted values from the decreasing trend for the Doppler tomographic observations. This indicates that transit photometry can simultaneously contribute to the measurements of the nodal precession using Doppler tomographic data. In Figure 6, although the impact parameter of WASP33b appeared to change linearly, the change in \ud835\udf06may not be along the model of the nodal precession. Thus, we should observe WASP-33b via Doppler tomography to clarify whether its \ud835\udf06 increases based on the model or decreases from 2021."

However, our value is similar to that of Dholakia et al. (2021), despite values that are \u223c2 \ud835\udf0e different. Notably, Dholakia et al. (2021) derived WASP-33b\u2019s \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc60 from light curve TESS photometric data considering its oblateness and gravity darkening. The derived stellar quadrupole moment of WASP-33b was \ud835\udc3d2 = (1.36+0.15\u22120.12)\u00d710 \u22124. This value agrees with that of Iorio (2016) within 1.5\ud835\udf0e, which is larger than those of the other previous studies (add> 3 \ud835\udf0e) and smaller than the theoretical value (\ud835\udc3d2 = 3.8\u00d710\u22124) calculated by Iorio (2011). One of the possible reasons for disagreements with the values of \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc60 and \ud835\udc3d2 could be the difference in the nodal precession model. Iorio (2016) and Watanabe et al. (2020) used time variation models for other orbital parameters: the ascending node \u03a9 and the orbital inclination to the apparent equatorial plane \ud835\udc3c, illustrated in Figure 4 of Watanabe et al. (2020), and calculated from \ud835\udf06 and \ud835\udc4f. Then, Borsa et al. (2021) estimated the change in the inclination angle \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5d (= arccos (\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc60/\ud835\udc4e)) as a linear function. In this study, we directly used the accurate time variation models of \ud835\udf06 and \ud835\udc4f, such that our derived values for \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc60 and \ud835\udc3d2 would be more accurate than those in previous studies. However, we should clarify the cause of the shortterm variation of \ud835\udf06 to create more detailed nodal precession model. In contrast, there is a probability that adding datasets also causes the disagreements. In this study, we found a short-term variation in \ud835\udf06, which may have been decreasing since 2016, although the reason remains unclear. Therefore, we have to obtain more datasets of WASP-33b\u2019s transits to more accurately determine their values.\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201311 (2020)\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201311 (2020)\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201311 (2020)\nDate \ud835\udf13 (deg) \ud835\udc3d2 \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc60 (deg) \ud835\udf032008 (deg)\nResults of this study 108.19+0.95\u22120.97 (1.36 +0.15 \u22120.12) \u00d7 10 \u22124 58.3+4.6\u22124.2 73.6 +1.7 \u22121.5 Iorio (2016) 99+5\u22124 (in 2008), 103 +5 \u22124 (in 2014) (2.1 +0.8 \u22120.5) \u00d7 10 \u22124 142+10\u221211 - Watanabe et al.

This uncertainty is larger than that reported by Borsa et al.\n(2021) owing to the difference in the precession model, which shows that \ud835\udc51\ud835\udf06/\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 of WASP-33b is always positive, while that of Borsa et al. (2021) allows \ud835\udc51\ud835\udf06/\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 = 0 at a certain time. The derived value indicates the possibility that WASP-33b has experienced the planetplanet scattering (Chatterjee et al. 2008) or Kozai migration (Fabrycky & Tremaine 2007), which are the mechanisms that cause the misaligned orbit. The existence of the WASP-33b\u2019s companion star is necessary for clarify distinguishing these two evolutionarymodels. Nevertheless, Doppler tomographic observations and transit photometry cannot detect the companion stars. Ngo et al. (2016) found a companion candidate for WASP-33, estimated as a dwarf star or brown dwarf and located at 238 AU (\ud835\udc43orb \u223c 3, 300 yrs) from the host star based on direct imaging. However, this candidate has not yet been confirmed owing to negligible proper motion. Thus, additional direct imaging observations are required to confirm whether the companion moves in the same proper motion as the host star or not. If the stellar companion candidate, with 0.1 \ud835\udc40\u2605, revolves in a circular orbit (\ud835\udc52 = 0) and WASP-33b was formed near the snow line, \u223c 5 AU (\ud835\udc43orb \u223c 12 yrs), the planet experienced a Kozai oscillation with the Kozai cycle period, \ud835\udc43Kozai, of 13 Myrs based on the following expression:\n\ud835\udc43Kozai = \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc43\n2 \ud835\udc50\n\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc4f (1 \u2212 \ud835\udc522\ud835\udc50)3/2, (8)\nwhere \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc60 , \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc50 , \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc50 , \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc4f , and \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc50 are the stellar mass, companion\u2019s mass, companion\u2019s period, planetary mass, and companion\u2019s eccentricity, respectively (Wu et al. 2007). Although we have to consider that the distance from the host star to the companion star is the skyprojected distance and the eccentricity of the companion star may exist, the Kozai cycle period could be shorter than the age of WASP-\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201311 (2020)\n33 (\u223c 100 Myrs).

The real spin-orbit obliquities of seven of these planets (WASP-33b, Kepler-13Ab, KELT-9b, KELT-17b, MASCARA-1b, MASCARA-4b, and WASP-189b) have been identified thus far,\nwhich are nearly vertical (60 deg < \ud835\udf13 < 120 deg). The remaining hot Jupiters reveal that only their projected spin-orbit obliquities were obtained. Three hot Jupiters around hot stars with \ud835\udf06 \u223c 90 deg, i.e., KELT-26b (\ud835\udf06 = 91.3+6.5\u22126.3 deg; Rodr\u00edguez Mart\u00ednez et al. 2020), HAT-P-70b (\ud835\udf06 = 113.1+5.1\u22123.4 deg; Zhou et al. 2019), and TOI-1518b (\ud835\udf06 = \u2212119.66+0.98\u22120.93 deg; Cabot et al. 2021), are valuable for detecting their observable nodal precessions to derive their \ud835\udf13. Even if \ud835\udf06 is near 0 deg or 180 deg, we can observe the change in the transit trajectory and measure \ud835\udf13 near 90 deg when the star rotates nearly pole-on for the line of sight. However, when \ud835\udf06 is near 0 or 180 deg and the star rotation axis is almost perpendicular to the line of sight, the transit trajectory barely moves because \ud835\udf13 should also be near 0 deg or 180 deg. In this case, we can estimate \ud835\udf13 as \ud835\udf06. Therefore, we should regularly observe the nodal precessions of these planets around their hot stars to measure their \ud835\udf13 using Doppler tomography and transit photometry.\nKepler-13Ab, orbiting around an A-type star, is the another hot Jupiter whose nodal precession has been detected by only transit photometries (Szab\u00f3 et al. 2011; Barnes et al. 2011). Previous studies have measured \ud835\udf13 of this hot Jupiter via gravity-darkened transit\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201311 (2020)\nphotometry, but the values were different between these two results (\ud835\udf13 = 60 \u00b1 2 deg in Masuda (2015) and \ud835\udf13 = 29 \u00b1 1 deg in Herman et al. (2018)). Although Kepler-13Ab is likely to have evolved with Kozai migration owing to its companion star, Kepler-13B (Santerne et al. 2012), the value of its \ud835\udf13 should be verified by adding Doppler tomographic observations and transit photometries to obtain an accurate histogram of the derived \ud835\udf13. As Johnson et al. (2014) measured the \ud835\udf06 of Kepler-13Ab in 2014 via Doppler tomography, an additional transit spectroscopic observation enabled us to detect the change in \ud835\udf06 and then to derive its \ud835\udf13 independently from the gravity-darkened transit photometry. Ahlers et al. (2020b), Lendl et al. (2020), Ahlers et al. (2020a), and Hooton et al. (2021) measured the \ud835\udf13 of MASCARA-4b (\ud835\udf13 = 104+7\u221213 deg), WASP-189b (\ud835\udf13 = 85.4 \u00b1 4.3 deg), KELT-9b (\ud835\udf13 = 87+10\u221211deg), and MASCARA-1b (\ud835\udf13 = 72.1+2.5\u22122.4 deg), respectively, using gravitydarkened transit photometry. Zhou et al. (2016) derived the \ud835\udf13 of KLET-17b (\ud835\udf13 = 116 \u00b1 4 deg) by the technique using the differential rotation of a host star. These planets are hot Jupiters around A-type stars: their nodal precessions are yet to be detected. Observing the nodal precessions of these hot Jupiters is important for verifying the values of their \ud835\udf13. This observation can also contribute to the investigations on the internal structure of hot stars by deriving the values of their \ud835\udc3d2. Although there are 17 hot Jupiters around hot starswhose projected spin-orbit obliquities have been measured, this number remains too small to statistically determine the orbital evolution tendency. Albrecht et al. (2021) found that planets around solar-like stars with large projected spin-orbit obliquities are likely to revolve on polar orbits (\ud835\udf13 \u223c 90 deg); however, the tendency remains unclear for hot Jupiters around hot stars because the real spin-orbit obliquities of only six of them have been revealed. If normal planet-disk interaction is the main migration, the distribution should gather at \ud835\udf13 = 0 deg (Lai et al. 2011). If the orbital evolution by planet-planet scattering is the majority, the orbits are likely to incline at approximately \ud835\udf13 = 60 deg (Nagasawa & Ida 2011). When Kozai migration is the primary evolution, \ud835\udf13 has a wide range from 10 deg to 140 deg (Petrovich 2015). As Barclay et al. (2018) predicted that the TESS mission could find 500 hot Jupiters around A-type stars from the 2-year observation, increasing the number of hot Jupiters around hot stars will become possible by validating TESS planet candidates. Further observations could lead to uncovering the detailed \ud835\udf13 distribution around hot stars."

            "heading": "7 CONCLUSION",
            "text": "We analysed the nodal precession of WASP-33b via Doppler tomography and transit photometry using various high-dispersion spectrographs including Subaru/HDS, HJST/TS23, OAC/HIDES, and TNG/HARPS-N, and two multicolour simultaneous cameras, OAC/MuSCAT and TCS/MuSCAT2. Based on the observed change in the projected spin-orbit obliquity \ud835\udf06 and the impact parameter \ud835\udc4f, we modelled the nodal precession of WASP-33b and derived the real spin-orbit obliquity of WASP-33b as \ud835\udf13 = 108.19+0.95\u22120.97 deg. Compared with the results of previous studies, the results of the near-polar orbit did not change. However, our value for \ud835\udf13 differed from that of Borsa et al. (2021) by > 3\ud835\udf0e. This discrepancy may be caused by whether or not \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56 is a constant value. We assumed \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56 as a constant while Borsa et al. (2021) did not; Borsa et al. (2021) adopted \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56 from its value at the 2011 epoch. We also simultaneously derived the stellar spin inclination and the stellar gravitational quadrupole moment ofWASP-33 as \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc60 = 58.3+4.6\u22124.2 deg, and \ud835\udc3d2 = (1.36 +0.15 \u22120.12)\u00d710\n\u22124, respectively. These results differed by > 3\ud835\udf0e from those of previous\nstudies on nodal precession, except for the \ud835\udc3d2 value reported in Iorio (2016) (\u223c 2.1\ud835\udf0e). A likely reason for these discrepancies is the different nodal precession models. For the first time, we applied the accurate time variation models for \ud835\udf06 and \ud835\udc4f to fit the nodal precession. Therefore, our derived values of \ud835\udf13, \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc60 , and \ud835\udc3d2 are the most accurate to date. Moreover, additional datasets may have updated these parameter values, thus causing these differences. Thus, acquiring more datasets will allow for the derivation of more accurate values of \ud835\udf13, \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc60 , and \ud835\udc3d2. We calculated the nodal precession speed \u00a4\ud835\udf03 = 0.507+0.025\u22120.022 deg year\u22121 and its period \ud835\udc43pre = 709+33\u221234 years, which revealed that WASP-33b transits in front of the host star for only \u223c 20 % of the entire nodal precession period. Based on this result, we speculate that WASP-33b began transiting in 1977\u00b12; we forecast that it will finish transiting in 2055\u00b12. The TESS survey should help us increase our ability to count number of hot Jupiters around hot stars in the future. Applying the proposed methodology to newly discovered hot Jupiters around hot stars is important not only for characterising each planetary system, but also for discriminating the migration mechanisms of such planets and investgating the internal structure of hot stars."
