INTRODUCTION\nOver the last 10 years most of research on semiconductor Nanowires (NWs) with Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) has focussed on the search for Majorana quasiparticles, which are believed to provide the building block for topologically protected quantum information1\u20136. Although signatures compatible with these exotic quasiparticles have been found in NWs proximized by superconducting films7\u201314, the race to the evidence of Majorana states has somewhat overshadowed other interesting potentialities of NWs in quantum technologies.\nIndeed NWs reaching lengths of various \u00b5m and exhibiting quantum coherent transport are nowadays fabricated both in the clean ballistic14\u201324 and in the diffusive regime25, and are also realized in suspended geometries9,26, in arrays24,27,28 and in networks23. Moreover, they can be used as flexible substrates for hybrid epitaxial growth on selected facets in order to design heterostructures with ferromagnets and superconductors29. Also, NWs represent an extremely versatile and tunable platform for nanoelectronics since their conduction properties can be controlled both magnetically, e.g. by applying a magnetic field along the NW axis and thereby opening up a gap in the spectrum, or electrically by controlling the RSOC through gate voltages. In particular, the tremendous improvement in gating techniques enables one to achieve a high control of the RSOC30\u201335.\nMost of these efforts have been devoted to enhance the magnitude of the RSOC over a wide range of values36\u201346. However, when an electron travels through a given spinorbit region, its spin polarization depends not only on the magnitude, but also on the sign of the local spinorbit coupling. Are there any observable effects that can be attributed to the sign? So far, this question has been addressed only in a few cases. Concerning the Dressel-\nhaus spin-orbit coupling, its sign reversal has been investigated in InGaAs rings47, whereas in the case of the RSOC the problem has mainly been addressed in twodimensional quantum wells interfaced with other suitable materials48\u201350 or where bulk subbands are characterized by opposite RSOC signs51. As far as one-dimensional single-channel NWs are concerned, it has been shown that a spatially modulated RSOC with alternating sign can drive the transition from a metallic to an insulating state52. Moreover, when a NW is exposed to a magnetic field along its axis and the RSOC magnitude is large, the propagating states in the magnetic gap exhibit a locking between propagation direction and spin, whose helicity is determined by the RSOC sign53\u201357. Nevertheless, when the NW with homogeneous RSOC is contacted to two electrodes, the electron transport turns out to depend only on the magnitude of the RSOC, and not on its sign, as we shall see below. Recent studies suggest that a different scenario may emerge in the presence of inhomogeneous RSOC profile. A junction between two regions with opposite RSOC signs, for instance, exhibits interesting spectral and equilibrium properties at the interface, such as localized bound states58,59 and orthogonal spin polarization60, which look surprisingly similar to the ones of the topological phase. In experimental implementations, where the RSOC can be locally controlled by gates, these inhomogeneous configurations can be realized by coupling various gates along the NW, providing an additional knob to control the electrical current flowing through the NW setup.\nThe question arises whether in such inhomogeneous configurations the sign of the RSOC can lead to any observable effect on out of equilibrium properties. In this paper we investigate this problem by analyzing the electron transport through a single-channel NW with inhomogeneous RSOC in the coherent quantum limit. The paper is organized as follows. In Sec.II we present the\nar X\niv :2\n20 7.\n03 77\n3v 2\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .m\nes -h\nal l]\n2 3\nSe p\n20 22\n2 model and describe the adopted method. Then, in Sec.III we discuss the two necessary ingredients to observe the effects of the sign of the RSOC, namely the presence of a uniform magnetic field and the existence of at least two regions with different RSOC. In Sec.IV we first perform a preliminary analysis of the transmission in the presence of a single interface separating two regions with different RSOC, finding a quite different behavior of the electrical conductance in the cases of equal and opposite RSOC signs. Then, by analyzing a more realistic configuration, where two differently gated portions of a NW are separated by a finite distance, we show that such lengthscale can modify the results obtained in the ideal limit of one single interface case. This enables us to identify the conditions where the sign of the RSOC affects the NW transport properties, and the situations where only the RSOC magnitude matters. Finally, in Sec.VI we discuss our results and draw our conclusions."

First, in the absence of Zeeman field (h\u22a5 = 0), while for a homogeneous problem Eq.(6) is just a mere energy constant and the spin-orbit coupling gets completely gauged out, in an inhomogeneous problem the spatial profile of the effective scalar potential USO(x) does affect electron transmission, although in a spin-independent way.68 For instance, in the case of a piecewise constant RSOC, USO(x) acquires the form of a potential step, a quantum well or a barrier, leading to an energy dependent transmission. The second aspect is that, when the Zeeman term h\u22a5 is additionally present, the last term of Eq.(5) acquires the form of a magnetic texture in the spin x-y plane characterized by the rotation angle \u03c6SO(x) in Eq.(4), which represents the integrated local spin-orbit wavevector (multiplied by 2). In this case the role of the spin degree of freedom becomes not trivial because of the interplay between actual magnetic field and spin-orbit effective magnetic field. In the following, we shall occasionally refer to the mapping to Eq.(5) in order to interpret some of our results."

Indeed it consists of two bands (see Fig.1), separated by a gap \u2206 = 2EZ at k = 0, where the lower band exhibits one minimum or two minima depending on whether the region is in the Zeeman-dominated regime (2ESO,j < EZ) or in the Rashba-dominated regime (2ESO,j > EZ). The classification of the eigenstates is in principle straightforward, although it requires a little more care in practice. First, while the spectrum does not depend on the sign of the RSOC \u03b1j , the eigenstates do. Since this will play a role in the results to be presented below, in Fig.1 we have highlighted the k-dependent spin orientation in the x-z plane of the local eigenstates, distinguishing the cases \u03b1 > 0 and \u03b1 < 0 by blue and red arrows, respectively. Furthermore, since in the quantum coherent limit the inhomogeneous solution is characterized by a given energy E, in each region one has to identify all 4 wavevectors corresponding to such energy, retaining both real wavevectors (propagating modes) and complex wavevectors (evanescent modes). In particular, the expression of the evanescent modes, which turn out to play an important role when matching the wavefunctions in different regions, leads to one further distinction between the weak Zeeman regime (2ESO,j < EZ < 4ESO,j) and the strong Zeeman regime (EZ > 4ESO,j). After performing such lengthy but straightforward classification of all eigenstates, whose technical details and results are reported in Appendix A, the general solution at energy E is built up by matching the linear superpositions at each\ninterface. Explicitly, at the j-th interface located at position xj and separating two regions with RSOC values \u03b1j (on the left) and \u03b1j+1 (on the right), the boundary conditions are \u03a8\u0302(x\u2212j ) = \u03a8\u0302(x + j )\n\u2202x\u03a8\u0302(x \u2212 j ) = \u2202x\u03a8\u0302(x + j )\u2212 im \u2217 ~2 (\u03b1j+1 \u2212 \u03b1j)\u03c3z\u03a8\u0302(xj) (9) Then, by applying the Scattering Matrix Formalism69, where the external regions act like the leads and the inhomogeneous profile determines the Scattering region, we compute the Scattering Matrix and determine the Transmission coefficient T (E) for various inhomogeneous configurations. Details and examples are provided in Appendix B. This enables us to determine how the low temperature linear conductance\nG = e2\nh T (EF ) (10)\ndepends on the RSOC and the Zeeman field, allowing for an electrical and magnetic tuning of the transport properties."

            "text": "Because our purpose is to analyze the effect of the sign of the RSOC on transport properties, it is first worth pointing out some general conditions for this to be observed. We start by noting that the transmission coefficient is completely independent of a global sign change of the RSOC profile, \u03b1(x) \u2192 \u2212\u03b1(x). Indeed the Hamiltonian (1) with a profile \u2212\u03b1(x) can be mapped back into the one with a profile +\u03b1(x) through the transformation \u03a8\u0302(x) \u2192 \u03c3x\u03a8\u0302(x). This implies, for instance, that for a finite length NW with a homogeneous RSOC contacted two normal leads with vanishing RSOC, modelled with an inhomogeneous profile \u03b1(x) = \u03b1 \u03b8(d/2\u2212 |x|), where \u03b8 denotes the Heaviside function and d is the NW length, the conductance is independent of sgn(\u03b1). In particular, we note that the effect of Fano anti-resonances with vanishing transmission occurring in such a case for suitably chosen parameters67,70,71 is completely insensitive to the sign of the RSOC in the NW.\nThus, a necessary condition for the effects of the RSOC sign to be observed is that the sign of the RSOC in a portion of the profile \u03b1(x) changes with respect to the rest. However, it may not be sufficient. Compare for instance the uniform profile \u03b1(x) \u2261 \u03b10 and the inhomogeneous profile \u03b1(x) = \u03b10sgn(x), where the sign on the left of the origin is changed with respect to the one on the right. Despite the abrupt sign change of the RSOC, in the absence of the Zeeman field (h\u22a5 = 0) the electron transmission is always perfect and equal to the case of a uniform profile. This can be straightforwardly deduced from the mapping described\n4 in Sec.II A, since the potential Eq.(6) reduces to a mere homogeneous constant USO \u2261 \u2212m\u2217\u03b120/2~2. In contrast, if h\u22a5 6= 0, the term in the second line of Eq.(5) is present and the phase \u03c6SO(x) in Eq.(4) depends on the sign of \u03b1.\nFrom these remarks, we conclude that the two essential ingredients to observe effects of the RSOC sign on electron transport are i) a Zeeman field directed perpendicularly to the RSOC effective magnetic field and ii) the presence of at least two regions with different RSOC value. This is what we shall consider in the following, focussing on the intrinsic transmission properties of the inhomogeneous RSOC. The presence of spurious resistance due to non-ideal contacts with external electrodes can in principle be taken into account with the method outlined in Appendix B. However, it depends on the specific metals used as electrodes and on the adiabaticity of the contacts72, and it goes beyond the purpose of this paper."

(11) Depending on the strength of the RSOC, each interface side can be in the Rashba-dominated or in the Zeemandominated regime. After solving the scattering problem, as outlined in the Appendix B, we have determined the transmission coefficient and the conductance from Eq.(10). Specifically, Fig.2 shows the conductance G, in units of the conductance quantum G0 = e\n2/h, as a function of the Fermi energy EF , in units of the Zeeman energy EZ , for the three independent configurations: Zeeman-Zeeman, Rashba-Rashba, and RashbaZeeman73. In particular, Fig.2(a) illustrates the case where the RSOC has the same sign in both sides. Recalling that the energy range |EF | < EZ corresponds to the magnetic gap (see Fig.1), we first note that, when both sides are in the Rashba-dominated regime (red curve), transmission is possible also in the energy range below the magnetic gap, where it can also exceed G0. This is because two propagating channels exist in the range Emin < E < \u2212EZ , as one can see from the mexican-hat shaped lower band in Fig.1(a). At the energies EF = \u00b1EZ corresponding to the magnetic gap edges, the conductance of Fig.2(a) exhibits two sharp anti-resonance suppression cusps, an effect similar to the one found in Refs.[70] and [71] in a NW coupled to two leads. We shall comment about this aspect at the end of this section. Apart from these features, one finds a practically perfect transmission, namely G = G0 when the Fermi energy lies inside the magnetic gap, |EF | < EZ , (one propagating channel) and G = 2G0 above the gap\n2.0 1.5 1.0 0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 EF/EZ\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\nG[e2/h]\nL(Zeeman), R(Zeeman) L(Rashba), R(Rashba) L(Rashba), R(Zeeman)\n2.0 1.5 1.0 0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 EF/EZ\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\nG[e2/h]\nL(Zeeman), R(Zeeman) L(Rashba), R(Rashba) L(Rashba), R(Zeeman)\n(a)\n(b)\nx <latexit sha1_base64=\"FZ8tFKiYxGY/+jxiz+f2cL7z0Kk=\">AAAB6HicbZC7SgNBFIbPxltcb1FLm8EgWIXdWGgjBm0sEzAXSEKYnZxNxsxemJkVw5InsLFQxFYfxt5GfBsnl0ITfxj4+P9zmHOOFwuutON8W5ml5ZXVtey6vbG5tb2T292rqSiRDKssEpFseFSh4CFWNdcCG7FEGngC697gapzX71AqHoU3ehhjO6C9kPucUW2syn0nl3cKzkRkEdwZ5C8+7PP4/csud3KfrW7EkgBDzQRVquk6sW6nVGrOBI7sVqIwpmxAe9g0GNIAVTudDDoiR8bpEj+S5oWaTNzfHSkNlBoGnqkMqO6r+Wxs/pc1E+2ftVMexonGkE0/8hNBdETGW5Mul8i0GBqgTHIzK2F9KinT5ja2OYI7v/Ii1IoF96RQrDj50iVMlYUDOIRjcOEUSnANZagCA4QHeIJn69Z6tF6s12lpxpr17MMfWW8/Rx2QPQ==</latexit>\nSO <latexit sha1_base64=\"vB24Pm73pXq0AKsuwtwIWsVD7do=\">AAAB8HicbVDLSgNBEOyNrxhfUY+KDAbBU9iNBz0GvXgzQfOQZAmzk0kyZGZ2mZkVwpKjX+DFgyJe/YJ8hze/wZ9w8jhoYkFDUdVNd1cQcaaN6345qaXlldW19HpmY3Nreye7u1fVYawIrZCQh6oeYE05k7RimOG0HimKRcBpLehfjf3aA1WahfLODCLqC9yVrMMINla6b0Y91kpub4atbM7NuxOgReLNSK54OCp/Px6NSq3sZ7MdklhQaQjHWjc8NzJ+gpVhhNNhphlrGmHSx13asFRiQbWfTA4eohOrtFEnVLakQRP190SChdYDEdhOgU1Pz3tj8T+vEZvOhZ8wGcWGSjJd1Ik5MiEaf4/aTFFi+MASTBSztyLSwwoTYzPK2BC8+ZcXSbWQ987yhbJN4xKmSMMBHMMpeHAORbiGElSAgIAneIFXRznPzpvzPm1NObOZffgD5+MHw/+UFQ==</latexit>\nx <latexit sha1_base64=\"FZ8tFKiYxGY/+jxiz+f2cL7z0Kk=\">AAAB6HicbZC7SgNBFIbPxltcb1FLm8EgWIXdWGgjBm0sEzAXSEKYnZxNxsxemJkVw5InsLFQxFYfxt5GfBsnl0ITfxj4+P9zmHOOFwuutON8W5ml5ZXVtey6vbG5tb2T292rqSiRDKssEpFseFSh4CFWNdcCG7FEGngC697gapzX71AqHoU3ehhjO6C9kPucUW2syn0nl3cKzkRkEdwZ5C8+7PP4/csud3KfrW7EkgBDzQRVquk6sW6nVGrOBI7sVqIwpmxAe9g0GNIAVTudDDoiR8bpEj+S5oWaTNzfHSkNlBoGnqkMqO6r+Wxs/pc1E+2ftVMexonGkE0/8hNBdETGW5Mul8i0GBqgTHIzK2F9KinT5ja2OYI7v/Ii1IoF96RQrDj50iVMlYUDOIRjcOEUSnANZagCA4QHeIJn69Z6tF6s12lpxpr17MMfWW8/Rx2QPQ==</latexit>\nSO <latexit sha1_base64=\"vB24Pm73pXq0AKsuwtwIWsVD7do=\">AAAB8HicbVDLSgNBEOyNrxhfUY+KDAbBU9iNBz0GvXgzQfOQZAmzk0kyZGZ2mZkVwpKjX+DFgyJe/YJ8hze/wZ9w8jhoYkFDUdVNd1cQcaaN6345qaXlldW19HpmY3Nreye7u1fVYawIrZCQh6oeYE05k7RimOG0HimKRcBpLehfjf3aA1WahfLODCLqC9yVrMMINla6b0Y91kpub4atbM7NuxOgReLNSK54OCp/Px6NSq3sZ7MdklhQaQjHWjc8NzJ+gpVhhNNhphlrGmHSx13asFRiQbWfTA4eohOrtFEnVLakQRP190SChdYDEdhOgU1Pz3tj8T+vEZvOhZ8wGcWGSjJd1Ik5MiEaf4/aTFFi+MASTBSztyLSwwoTYzPK2BC8+ZcXSbWQ987yhbJN4xKmSMMBHMMpeHAORbiGElSAgIAneIFXRznPzpvzPm1NObOZffgD5+MHw/+UFQ==</latexit>\n\u21b5L > 0<latexit sha1_base64=\"q3EmYyaEa5E//c0b8FzQ7KmFo5M=\">AAAB8XicbVC7SgNBFL3rM8ZXjKXNkiBYhd0oaCUBLSwsIpgHJku4O5lNhszOLjOzQljyFzYWiljY+A3+gZWdf+PkUWjigQuHc+7l3nv8mDOlHefbWlpeWV1bz2xkN7e2d3Zze/m6ihJJaI1EPJJNHxXlTNCaZprTZiwphj6nDX9wMfYb91QqFolbPYypF2JPsIAR1Ea6ayOP+9i5Pnc6uaJTciawF4k7I8VK5vMjf/lWqHZyX+1uRJKQCk04KtVynVh7KUrNCKejbDtRNEYywB5tGSowpMpLJxeP7EOjdO0gkqaEtifq74kUQ6WGoW86Q9R9Ne+Nxf+8VqKDMy9lIk40FWS6KEi4rSN7/L7dZZISzYeGIJHM3GqTPkok2oSUNSG48y8vknq55B6XyjcmjROYIgMHUIAjcOEUKnAFVagBAQEP8ATPlrIerRfrddq6ZM1m9uEPrPcfw3WTOg==</latexit> \u21b5R > 0<latexit sha1_base64=\"aZQSGqkYYZ8Afnxb6WZTXe4hz8w=\">AAAB8XicbVDLSgNBEOz1GeMrxqOXJUHwFHajoCcJ6MFjFPPAZAm9k9lkyOzsMjMrhCV/4cWDIh68+A3+gSdv/o2Tx0ETCxqKqm66u/yYM6Ud59taWl5ZXVvPbGQ3t7Z3dnN7+bqKEklojUQ8kk0fFeVM0JpmmtNmLCmGPqcNf3Ax9hv3VCoWiVs9jKkXYk+wgBHURrprI4/72Lk5dzq5olNyJrAXiTsjxUrm8yN/+VaodnJf7W5EkpAKTTgq1XKdWHspSs0Ip6NsO1E0RjLAHm0ZKjCkyksnF4/sQ6N07SCSpoS2J+rviRRDpYahbzpD1H01743F/7xWooMzL2UiTjQVZLooSLitI3v8vt1lkhLNh4YgkczcapM+SiTahJQ1IbjzLy+SernkHpfK1yaNE5giAwdQgCNw4RQqcAVVqAEBAQ/wBM+Wsh6tF+t12rpkzWb24Q+s9x/MmZNA</latexit>\n\u21b5R > 0 <latexit sha1_base64=\"aZQSGqkYYZ8Afnxb6WZTXe4hz8w=\">AAAB8XicbVDLSgNBEOz1GeMrxqOXJUHwFHajoCcJ6MFjFPPAZAm9k9lkyOzsMjMrhCV/4cWDIh68+A3+gSdv/o2Tx0ETCxqKqm66u/yYM6Ud59taWl5ZXVvPbGQ3t7Z3dnN7+bqKEklojUQ8kk0fFeVM0JpmmtNmLCmGPqcNf3Ax9hv3VCoWiVs9jKkXYk+wgBHURrprI4/72Lk5dzq5olNyJrAXiTsjxUrm8yN/+VaodnJf7W5EkpAKTTgq1XKdWHspSs0Ip6NsO1E0RjLAHm0ZKjCkyksnF4/sQ6N07SCSpoS2J+rviRRDpYahbzpD1H01743F/7xWooMzL2UiTjQVZLooSLitI3v8vt1lkhLNh4YgkczcapM+SiTahJQ1IbjzLy+SernkHpfK1yaNE5giAwdQgCNw4RQqcAVVqAEBAQ/wBM+Wsh6tF+t12rpkzWb24Q+s9x/MmZNA</latexit> \u21b5L < 0<latexit sha1_base64=\"R+ipgFHj5sExGSdYykC9uVPkVyw=\">AAAB8XicbVC7SgNBFL3rM8ZXjKXNkiBYhd0oaGER0MLCIoJ5YLKEu5PZZMjs7DIzK4Qlf2FjoYiFjd/gH1jZ+TdOHoUmHrhwOOde7r3HjzlT2nG+raXlldW19cxGdnNre2c3t5evqyiRhNZIxCPZ9FFRzgStaaY5bcaSYuhz2vAHF2O/cU+lYpG41cOYeiH2BAsYQW2kuzbyuI+d63Onkys6JWcCe5G4M1KsZD4/8pdvhWon99XuRiQJqdCEo1It14m1l6LUjHA6yrYTRWMkA+zRlqECQ6q8dHLxyD40StcOImlKaHui/p5IMVRqGPqmM0TdV/PeWPzPayU6OPNSJuJEU0Gmi4KE2zqyx+/bXSYp0XxoCBLJzK026aNEok1IWROCO//yIqmXS+5xqXxj0jiBKTJwAAU4AhdOoQJXUIUaEBDwAE/wbCnr0XqxXqetS9ZsZh/+wHr/AcBrkzg=</latexit>\nFIG. 2. The conductance of the single interface problem [see Eq.(11)] is plotted in units of conductance quantum G0 = e2/h as a function of the Fermi energy EF (in units of the Zeeman energy EZ) for various spin-orbit configurations. In each panel the black curve refers to the case where both regions are Zeeman-dominated (2ESO,L = 0.3EZ ; 2ESO,R = 0.5EZ), the red curve to the case where both regions are Rashbadominated (2ESO,L = 2EZ ; 2ESO,R = 5EZ), while the green curve to the case where the left region is Rashba-dominated and the right region is Zeeman dominated (2ESO,L = 3EZ ; 2ESO,R = 0.5EZ). While panel (a) refers to the case where \u03b1L, \u03b1R > 0, panel (b) refers to the case of coupling changing sign across the junction, \u03b1L < 0 and \u03b1R > 0. Insets: the spatial behavior of the spin-orbit angle (4) describing the rotation of the effective magnetic texture problem (5).\nE > EZ (two propagating channels), regardless of the specific regime configuration.\nA different scenario emerges when the RSOC takes opposite signs across the interface, as shown in Fig.2(b). In all configurations the conductance in the magnetic gap range |EF | < EZ remains roughly symmetric with respect to the midgap energy value EF = 0. However, we note that, while the transmission is practically perfect when both sides are in the strong Zeeman regime (black curve), it reduces when one region enters the Rashba regime (green curve) and even more when both regions are Rashba-dominated (red curve). The different behavior of the conductance in the two panels (a) and (b) can be qualitatively understood through the mapping to the magnetic texture problem Eq.(5). In the present case of the profile Eq.(11) the rotation angle (4) of the magnetic\n5 field acquires the form\n\u03c6SO(x) = 2m\u2217\n~ \u00d7  \u03b1Rx for x > 0\u03b1Lx for x < 0 (12) and its spatial behavior is depicted in the insets of the two panels of Fig.2. If \u03b1L and \u03b1R have the same sign [inset of panel (a)], the incoming wavefunction can easily adapt to the change of slope of \u03c6SO(x) from one side to the other by simply stretching or shrinking, since a coordinate rescaling x\u2192 x\u03b1R/\u03b1L would compensate for the slope change. This leads to a very high tranmission. In contrast, when \u03b1L and \u03b1R have opposite signs, an actual cusp appears in \u03c6SO [inset of panel (b)], which cannot be merely removed by an affine coordinate transformation. It is therefore more difficult for the incoming wavefunction spinor to re-adapt to the profile on the other side of the interface. As long as the values of the RSOC are small (both regions in the Zeeman dominated regime) this effect is negligible, but when both regions enter the Rashba-dominated regime the mismatch becomes important and the transmission is suppressed.\nThe role of the RSOC sign can also be highlighted by considering the magnetic tuning of the conductance G in a Rashba interface where both sides are in the same regime. As an illustrative example of such situation, Fig.3 describes the Fermi energy dependence of G for a junction with ESO,R/ESO,L = 0.8, for various values of the Zeeman energy EZ . Specifically, panel(a) shows the case where the RSOC takes the same sign across the interface (\u03b1L, \u03b1R > 0). When the magnetic field is absent (green dash-dotted curve) the conductance vanishes for EF < \u2212ESO,R and then rapidly increases to 2G0 for EF > \u2212ESO,R. This is exactly the same energy dependence as a spin-degenerate problem of transmission across a potential step (\u2212ESO,L| \u2212ESO,R), as argued invoking the mapping described in Sec.II A. In contrast, when a weak Zeeman field is introduced (red solid curve), the conductance gets suppressed down to G0 for |EF | < EZ due to the magnetic gap opening that leaves only one propagating channel. Again, very narrow cusps with vanishing conductance appear at Fermi energies corresponding to the magnetic gap boundaries EF = \u00b1EZ (one of them is highlighted in the inset on the left). For a stronger Zeeman field (black dashed line) both sides enter the Zeeman-dominated regime and the conductance acquires a step-like behavior characterizing the number of propagating channels (0, 1 or 2). Thus, in this case of equal RSOC signs, the Zeeman energy in practice controls only the number of such channels, i.e. the value at which the jump occurs. Figure 3(b) instead describes the case of opposite RSOC sign across the interface, i.e. \u03b1L < 0 and \u03b1R > 0. For vanishing Zeeman field the conductance is insensitive to the sign of the RSOC, so that the green dash-dotted curve is exactly equal to the one obtained in Fig.3(a). Again, exploiting the mapping (3) described in Sec.II A, one can see that in such situation only the potential (6) is present.

The single interface problem [see Eq.(11)] with ESO,R = 0.8ESO,L. The conductance G in units of the conductance quantum G0 = e 2/h as function of the Fermi energy EF /ESO,L, for different values of the Zeeman energy EZ . (a) The case where the RSOC takes the same sign on both interface sides. Note that, when both sides are in the Rashba-dominated regime (red curve) a peak of 2G0 conductance is present for Emin < E < \u2212EZ , i.e. for \u22120.878 < E/ESO,L < \u22120.5, due to the presence of two propagating channels below the magnetic gap energy (see Fig.1(a)). The inset on the right magnifies the sharp anti-resonance cusp occurring when the Fermi energy equals the upper boundary of the magnetic gap EF = +EZ . Similar behavior occurs at the lower boundary EF = \u2212EZ . In this case the Zeeman energy EZ only controls the number of propagating channels (0, 1 or 2) and the conductance varies discretely in practice. (b) The case where the RSOC has opposite signs across the interface. In this case the Zeeman energy also enables one to vary continuously the conductance over the entire energy range.\ncontrast, when the Zeeman field is introduced, the sign of the RSOC matters and the behavior strongly differs from panel (a). The conductance varies continuously as a function of the Fermi energy. In this case the Zeeman energy EZ determines not only the location of the suppression cusps at the magnetic gap edges, but also the magnitude of G in the entire energy range. In particular, when the NW is in the Rashba dominated regime (red curve), the conductance is significantly suppressed inside and below the magnetic gap.\nAnti-resonances in the conductance. We conclude this section by a comment about the anti-resonance cusps with vanishing conductance displayed in Figs.2 and 3.\n6 We emphasize that their presence is not due to the RSOC sign change across the interface, as they do exist both in the case of equal and opposite RSOC signs, and turn out to be much sharper in the former case [see inset of Fig.3(a)]. Although this effect is thus generic and not strictly related to the main focus of our paper, for the sake of completeness in the presentation of our results, a brief discussion about their origin is in order. We recall that the existence of vanishing conductance dips, typically close in energy to resonance peaks of perfect transmission, is known to occur in the case of a NW contacted to leads70,71, and is attributed to the fact that the RSOC present in the centrally confined NW region leads to a spin misalignment of its bound states with respect to the outer leads with continuum spectrum, causing one bound state to be strongly coupled to the continuum, while the other one is very weakly coupled. With respect to the configuration analyzed in Refs.[70] and [71], our case of a single interface between two RSOC regions exhibits two differences: i) here, within the energy gap, there are no bound states at the interface74; ii) the anti-resonances with vanishing transmission are always pinned at the boundaries E = \u00b1EZ of the magnetic gap. Their origin can be argued as follows. Within the energy range |E| < EZ of the magnetic gap, each side of the interface is characterized by propagating modes (see Fig.1), whose spin orientations lying in the x-z spin plane are in general misaligned, because the RSOC takes different values across the interface. However, one also has evanescent modes originating from the band spinsplitting in the magnetic gap [see Fig.8(b) and Fig.9(b) and (c) in App.A], whose spin orientation lies in the xy spin plane. On each interface side the wavefunction is thus a superposition of both propagating and evanescent modes. Although the transmission is carried by the propagating modes only, the evanescent modes indirectly affect the transmission because they contribute to realize the wavefunction matching Eq.(9) at the interface. Effectively, one could consider the two RSOC regions as \u201cleads\u201d with (massless) propagating modes \u03a8pr with misaligned spins, which are coupled to (massive) evanescent modes \u03a8ev = \u03bee\n\u00b1\u03ba+x localized at the interface, whose spinor \u03be effectively performs the spin rotation, thereby favoring the transmission75. Of course, in the case of equal RSOC signs, the misalignment of the propagating modes is less pronounced than in the case of opposite RSOC signs, and this is why for |E| < EZ the transmission is typically higher in Fig.2(a) than in 2(b). However, as the energy approaches (say) the upper edge of the magnetic gap, E \u2192 EZ , each evanescent mode becomes the state related to the minimum of the upper band (see Fig.1): Its spin gets locked along x and its decay lengthscale diverges. This makes it effectively unable to guarantee a finite transmission, since a spatially uniform mode has a vanishing spatial overlap with a propagating mode. The transmission thus vanishes with a cusp behavior because the evanescent mode wavevector \u03ba+ vanishes with an infinite slope as a function of energy E \u2192 EZ . To a more\nquantitative level, one can see that in such a limit \u03a8ev can contribute to the first interface matching Eq.(9) only with a spin along x, and its contribution to the spatial derivative in the second Eq.(9) vanishes. It turns out that the only way to realize a wavefunction matching of both Eqs.(9) at the interface is to have a totally reflected mode, as one can verify by plotting the wavefunction profile (not shown here). A similar effect occurs at the lower magnetic gap edge E \u2192 \u2212EZ when the region is in the Rashba-dominated regime, since the evanescent mode becomes the state related to the local maximum of the lower band (see Fig.1)."

            "text": "The analysis of the single interface case carried out in the previous Section indicates that the conductance heavily depends on the relative sign between the two RSOC regions. However, a sharp separation between the two RSOC regions is in fact an idealization. In a realistic NW setup, where the RSOC can be locally controlled by different gates, a finite distance d separates the gates, as shown in the configurations sketched in Fig.4. In particular, panel (a) describes a realization with a NW deposited on a substrate and covered by two \u2126-gates20.In this kind of setup the NW is usually separated from the metallic gate by a thin (few nm) dielectric with high relative dielectric constant, which \u2013at a given gate voltage\u2013 enhances the interface field causing the RSOC32,76. In contrast, Fig.4(b) illustrates a suspended NW coupled to two pairs of side gates with the advantage of strongly reducing the presence of defects26. In both cases the gate voltages control the magnitude and the sign of the RSOC.\nWe now want to take into account the finite size d of the central region separating the two gated NW regions, which was neglected in the preliminary analysis of Sec.IV. For definiteness we shall assume that the RSOC in the central region is negligible, so that it is in the strongly Zeeman-dominated regime, and we shall adopt the following profile\n\u03b1(x) =  \u03b1L for x < \u2212d/2 0 for |x| < d/2\n\u03b1R for x > d/2\n.

Two possible realizations of a doubly gated NW, where two different NW regions, characterized by different RSOC, are separated by a distance d. (a) The NW lies on a substrate and is contacted to two \u2126-gates (see e.g. Ref.[20]). (b) The NW is suspended and coupled to two pairs of side gates (see e.g. Ref.[26]).\nand the related spin-orbit lengths k\u22121SO,j . For definiteness we take ESO,L = 2ESO,R and express the gate separation d in units of the shorter spin-orbit length k\u22121SO,L. In particular, Fig.5(a) illustrates the result for a short gate separation: The conductance is practically perfect inside the magnetic gap when the two regions have equal RSOC sign (black curve), whereas it is suppressed when the two regions have opposite RSOC sign (red curve). Moreover, transmission is almost symmetric in energy and flat around the middle of the magnetic gap (E = 0). The result does not deviate much from the one obtained in Fig.2 for the ideal d \u2192 0 limit. However, for large gate separation [see Fig.5(b)], the difference between the two cases of equal or opposite RSOC signs is strongly reduced, except for a small difference near the gap edge E/EZ = +1. This is due to the fact that, for larger separation d, the electron spin has a spatial room to readapt to the different orientation imposed by the opposite RSOC sign. We also note the cusps with vanishing conductance discussed in the single interface problem are modified by the finite distance d between the gates. First, the effect of vanishing conductance may still be present, but it occurs at values of Fermi energy that can slightly differ from the magnetic gap boundaries, as is visible e.g. in the black curve of Fig.5(b), near the upper magnetic gap boundary EF = +EZ . This makes the doubly gated NW configuration similar to the configuration of a NW contacted to leads70,71. Second, the cusp behavior might occur at a finite conductance value. This can be the case even for a short distance d [see Fig.5(a)] and is especially visible near the lower magnetic gap boundary EF = \u2212EZ .

The two panels correspond to a different value d of the distance between the two gated regions, expressed in units of the shortest spin-orbit lengthscale k\u22121SO,L, namely short distance (panel (a)), and large distance (panel (b)). The black and red curves refer to the case where the two regions have equal and opposite sign of the RSOC, respectively.\n(kSO,Ld < 0.01) one recovers the vanishing conductance of the single interface problem.\nFigure 6 illustrates how the conductance, evaluated at three different Fermi energy values inside the magnetic gap, behaves as a function of the distance d between the two gates. At short distance, kSO,Ld 1, the behavior of G strongly depends on whether the signs of the two RSOCs are equal [panel (a)] or opposite [panel (b)]: In the former case it is independent of the distance d for all energy values (G \u223c= G0), while in the latter case it linearly grows with the distance and it is small (G G0). As the distance d becomes of the order of the spin-orbit length, kSO,Ld \u223c 1, in both cases the conductance exhibits a crossover to an oscillatory behavior. This originates from the fact that at the boundaries of the central region part of the electron wave is reflected, giving rise to interference conditions that depend on the distance d. Because the electron wavelength depends on the Fermi energy, such oscillatory pattern depends on EF too, as one can see from the different period characterizing the various curves.

Panels (a) and (b) illustrate the cases of equal and opposite RSOC sign, respectively\nRSOC signs of the two regions, as can be appreciated by comparing panels (a) and (b).\nImplementation with InSb NWs. Let us now consider a specific implementation of the setup of Fig.4 with a InSb NW, with effective mass m\u2217 = 0.015me and g-factor g ' 50, exposed to a magnetic field corresponding to a Zeeman energy EZ = 0.1meV. For definiteness, for the RSOC in the right region we have fixed a positive value \u03b1R ' 0.552 eVA\u030a > 0 corresponding to a spin-orbit energy ESO,R = 0.3 meV = 3EZ , so that the right region is in the Rashba-dominated regime. Then, by varying \u03b1L over a broad range of positive and negative values, we have analyzed how the conductance in the middle of the magnetic gap (EF = 0) depends on the ratio \u03b1L/\u03b1R. The result is plotted in Fig.7 for four different values of the distance d between the two gates, which can be compared to the reference lengthscale given by the fixed spin-orbit length of the right-side is k\u22121SO,R ' 92 nm. As one can see, when d is much shorter than the latter scale (black curve) the conductance G exhibits a strongly asymmetric curve as a function of \u03b1L/\u03b1R. In this case G depends only weakly on the magnitude of the RSOC, and strongly on the sign. Indeed a sign switch of \u03b1L from positive to negative changes the transmission from high to low val-\nues. In contrast, when d becomes of the order of the spin-orbit length (red and green curves), the asymmetry of the curve gradually softens and eventually, for a large separation d = 1\u00b5m (blue curve), the conductance exhibits a completely symmetric Lorentzian-like behavior as a function of \u03b1L/\u03b1R. In this regime only the magnitude of the RSOC determines the conductance, while the relative sign of the RSOC plays no role.\n\u22125 \u22124 \u22123 \u22122 \u22121 0 1 2 3 4 5 \u03b1L/\u03b1R\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\nG[e2/h]\nd = 30 nm d = 100 nm d = 200 nm d = 1\u00b5m\nFIG. 7. The implementation of the double gate configuration with a InSb NW (m\u2217 = 0.015me) exposed to a magnetic field with an Zeeman energy EZ = 0.1 meV. The RSOC in the right region is fixed to be positive, \u03b1R > 0, and corresponding to a spin-orbit energy ESO,R = 0.3 meV (Rashba dominated regime), corresponding to a spin-orbit length k\u22121SO,R ' 92 nm. The RSOC \u03b1L in the left region is varied in magnitude and sign: The conductance at EF = 0 (middle of the magnetic gap) is shown as a function of the ratio \u03b1L/\u03b1R, for different values of the separation d between the two gates.\nThe helical limit. We conclude this section by a comment about the helical limit. As is well known, in the strongly Rashba-dominated regime, ESO EZ , the propagating states in the magnetic gap are helical, i.e. they exhibit a locking between the propagation direction1,2,53\u201357, similarly to the edge states of a 2D Topological Insulator. Importantly, in a NW the helicity is controlled by the sign of the RSOC. Explicitly, if \u03b1 > 0 right-movers are characterized by spin-\u2191 and leftmovers by spin-\u2193, while the opposite occurs for \u03b1 < 0, as is clear from the blue/red arrows in Fig.1(a). This opens up the possibility to conceive transport configurations that would be quite hard in 2D Topological Insulators. Let us now consider the inhomogeneous setup sketched in Fig.4 in the limit where both gated regions are set to the strongly Rashba-dominated and exhibit opposite RSOC signs. This implements a peculiar setup, namely a junction of helical states with opposite helicity, the so called Dirac paradox. As is well known, for a NW with homogeneous RSOC, the low energy transport within the magnetic gap, i.e. in the energy range |EF | EZ , is well captured by a massless Dirac model describing the helical states. One may thus wonder whether in such energy window the behavior of the conductance for the inhomogeneous setup of Fig.4 could be deduced from the low energy massless Dirac models. This is indeed the case when the RSOC takes the same sign in both gated re-\n9 gions: The low energy effective theory is well captured by two massless Dirac models with the same helicity, one on each region, and one recovers a perfect transmission at low energy77. However, in the case of opposite RSOC signs, the customary massless Dirac models are not sufficient to describe the low-energy transport. Instead it is possible to show75 that additional massive Dirac modes have to be included on each side to correctly account for the low-energy behavior at |EF | EZ . Although in such energy window these modes are evanescent and carry no current directly, they do contribute to the current indirectly by favoring the correct wavefunction matching at the interface. The transmission thus depends on the parameter kSOd in a non-monotonous way\n75, in agreement with the more general results presented here."

            "text": "In Conclusion, in this paper we have analyzed the effects of the sign of the RSOC on electron transport in a one-dimensional electron channel in the quantum coherent regime. In the case of a NW with homogeneous RSOC and contacted to two electrodes, despite the spin orientation of the eigenstates depends on the sign of the RSOC (see Fig.1), we have shown that the transport properties are independent of sgn(\u03b1). In fact, in Sec.III we have identified two essential ingredients for the effects of the sign to be observed, namely the presence of i) at least two regions with different RSOC and ii) an additional Zeeman field that is non collinear with the effective RSOC magnetic field. In Sec.IV we have first analyzed the electron transport across an ideal interface separating two regions with different RSOC. We have shown that, when the sign of the RSOC is the same in both regions, the transmission is practically perfect, regardless of the regimes (Rashba- or Zeeman-dominated) of the two regions [see Fig.2(a)]. In this case the magnetic field essentially determines the number of conducting channels and the conductance can be tuned to integer values of the conductance quantum [see Fig.3(a)]. The scenario changes when the RSOC exhibits opposite signs at the two interface sides. In particular, while transmission remains extremely good when both regions are in the Zeeman regime, it reduces when one of the two regions enters the Rashba regime, and it gets suppressed when both regions are in the Rashba regime [see Fig.2(b)]. In this case, the conductance can be continuously tuned by varying the Zeeman field [see Fig.3(b)].\nThen, in Sec.V we have considered a more realistic NW setup, where two different RSOC regions are realized by coupling the NW to various gates (see Fig.4), and we\nhave taken into account the finite distance d between the gates. The impact of the sign is quite different in the two regimes of small and large separation d (see Fig.5). Indeed, by analyzing the conductance as a function of the separation d (see Fig.6), we have found that in the regime of short separation the conductance strongly depends on the relative RSOC signs, namely for equal signs one has G \u223c= G0, roughly independently of d, while for opposite signs one has G G0 growing linearly with d. In contrast, as the separation becomes comparable with the spin-orbit length, the conductance exhibits a crossover to an oscillatory behavior, originating from the quantum interference of the electron backscattering of the ends of the separation region. In particular, for large separation (kSO,Ld 1) such oscillatory behavior becomes independent of the relative RSOC signs.\nFurthermore, we have considered a specific implementation of the setup of Fig.4 with InSb NWs, for four realistic values of separation d between the gates. Focussing on the midgap conductance G of the setup as a function of the ratio \u03b1L/\u03b1R between the two RSOCs (see Fig.7), we have been able to identify the conditions where G is mainly determined by the sign or by the magnitude of the RSOC. In particular, for a short separation d = 30 nm, the conductance mainly depends on the relative RSOC signs, and one can tune G from a small to a high fraction of e2/h by varying the ratio \u03b1L/\u03b1R from negative to positive values (black curve in Fig.7). In this regime, the RSOC sign thus represents an actual additional knob to switch on/off the electron current through the NW. In contrast, for a large separation d = 1\u00b5m, the conductance becomes insensitive to the sign of \u03b1L/\u03b1R (see blue curve in Fig.7) and is mainly dependent on the RSOC magnitude only. Finally, we have discussed that, for the particular range of small energies |EF | EZ inside the magnetic gap, our findings are in agreement with the low-energy Dirac theory: While in the case of two regions with equal RSOC signs the low-energy electron transport is well described by massless Dirac modes, in the case of opposite RSOC signs this is not the case, and additional massive Dirac modes have to be included.\nA potentially interesting future development of this work is to extend the analysis of electron transport through the doubly gated NW to the case of ac gate voltages63,78\u201381, where two time-dependent RSOC are induced along the NW. Work is in progress along these lines."

Explicitly, the two eigenvectors of the lower band (\u03b2 = 1) and the upper band (\u03b2 = 2) are\n\u03c71(\u00b1k\u03b7(E;\u03b1)) =  cos ( \u03b8(\u00b1k\u03b7(E;\u03b1)) 2 ) sin ( \u03b8(\u00b1k\u03b7(E;\u03b1))\n2\n)  (A3)\n\u03c72(\u00b1k\u03b7(E;\u03b1)) =  \u2212 sin ( \u03b8(\u00b1k\u03b7(E;\u03b1)) 2 ) cos ( \u03b8(\u00b1k\u03b7(E;\u03b1))\n2\n)  (A4)\nrespectively, where\n11\ncos\n( \u03b8(\u00b1k\u03b7(E;\u03b1))\n2\n) = \u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a1 2 1\u00b1 sgn(\u03b1) \u221a 4ESO(E + 2ESO) + \u03b74ESO \u221a 4EESO + 4E2SO + E 2 Z\u2223\u2223\u2223\u221a4EESO + 4E2SO + E2Z + \u03b72ESO\u2223\u2223\u2223  (A5)\nsin\n( \u03b8(\u00b1k\u03b7(E;\u03b1))\n2\n) = sgn(h\u22a5) \u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a1 2 1\u2213 sgn(\u03b1) \u221a 4ESO(E + 2ESO) + \u03b74ESO \u221a 4EESO + 4E2SO + E 2 Z\u2223\u2223\u2223\u221a4EESO + 4E2SO + E2Z + \u03b72ESO\u2223\u2223\u2223  (A6)\nThe eigenstates (A3)-(A4) identify a spin lying in the x-z plane and forming an angle \u03b8 with the z-axis. This enables one to obtain the pattern of spin-orientation in the two bands in Fig.1.\nEvanescent states. One can proceed in a similar way for the evanescent modes \u03c8(x) = \u03be exp[\u00b1\u03bax], where \u03be is a spinor. Their spectrum E1,2(\u03ba) = \u2212\u03b50\u03ba \u2213 \u221a E2Z \u2212 (\u03b1\u03ba)2 consists of two bands (\u03b2 = 1, 2) touching at the energy Emin = \u2212E2Z/4ESO for |\u03ba| = EZ/|\u03b1|, as depicted in Fig.8(b) for the Rashba-dominated regime and in Figs.9(b) and (c) for the weak and strong Zeeman regime, respectively. When inverting the spectrum in favour of energy, one obtains\n\u03ba\u03b7(E;\u03b1) =\n\u221a 2m\u2217\n~\n\u221a \u2212E \u2212 2ESO + \u03b7 \u221a 4EESO + 4E2SO + E 2 Z \u03b7 = \u00b1 (A7)\nand the spinors acquire the form\n\u03be1(\u00b1\u03ba\u03b7(E;\u03b1)) = 1\u221a 2\n( e\u2213i arctan(sinh(\u03b8(\u03ba\u03b7(E;\u03b1))))\n1\n) (A8)\n\u03be2(\u00b1\u03ba\u03b7(E;\u03b1)) = 1\u221a 2\n( \u2212e\u00b1i arctan(sinh(\u03b8(\u03ba\u03b7(E;\u03b1))))\n1\n) (A9)\nwhere\nsinh(\u03b8(\u03ba\u03b7(E;\u03b1))) = sgn(\u03b1)\n\u221a \u22124ESO(E + 2ESO) + \u03b7 4ESO \u221a 4EESO + 4E2SO + E\n2 Z\u2223\u2223\u2223\u221a4EESO + 4E2SO + E2Z \u2212 \u03b7 2ESO\u2223\u2223\u2223 (A10)\nNote that, differently from the spinors of the propagating modes, the eigenstates (A8)-(A9) identify a spin lying in the x-y plane.\nThree possible regimes. Depending on the local value of ESO and EZ , the NW region can be in three possible regimes, namely Rashba-dominated (2ESO > EZ), weak Zeeman regime (2ESO < EZ < 4ESO) and strong Zeeman\nregime (EZ > 4ESO). For each of these regimes, there are various energy ranges where the eigenstates acquire different expressions. In Table I we have summarized the result for the Rashba-dominated regime. In particular, propagating states exist for E > Emin, as can be see from Fig.8(a). Their wavevectors are given by Eq.(A1), the spinors \u03c71 and \u03c72, related to the lower and upper band, respectively, are given in Eqs.(A3)-(A4), while the velocities are given in Eq.(A2). In contrast, evanescent modes exist for |E| < EZ , as shown in Fig.9(a), their wavevectors are given in Eqs.(A7), and the related spinors, related to the upper and lower band, are given in Eqs.(A8)-(A9). As far as the Zeeman-dominated regime is concerned (EZ > 2ESO), propagating modes exist for E > \u2212EZ (see Fig.8(b)), while evanescent modes exist for Emin < E < EZ . However, the explicit expression and type (upper/lower band) of the NW states also depends whether the NW is in the weak Zeeman subregime (2ESO < EZ < 4ESO) or in the strong Zeeman subregime (4ESO < EZ), as shown in Figs.9(b) and (c). The expressions of eigenstates in the\n13\nweak and strong Zeeman regimes are summarized in Tables II and III, respectively.\nAppendix B: Details about the evaluation of the Scattering Matrix and the Transmission coefficient\nHere we provide the technical details concerning the determination of the transmission coefficient for the system with inhomogeneous RSOC setup, whence the conductance is straightforwardly determined from Eq.(10). To this purpose, one first has compute the Transfer Matrix. We exploit the fact that, since the system is mesoscopic, energy is conserved, and we can write the general solution as a superposition over the energy E of stationary solutions \u03a8\u0302E(x, t) = \u03a8\u0302E(x) e\n\u2212iEt/~. In turn, in the j-th region (j = L,R = 0, 1) the field \u03a8\u0302E(x) is expressed as a superposition of all possible modes (propagating and evanescent) characterizing the region at a fixed energy E. These modes can be selected from Tables I, II and III, depending on the parameter regime (Rashba-dominated, weakly or strongly Zeeman dominated) and the energy sub-range.\nThe single interface case. As an example, let us consider the case of one single interface at x = 0, and assume that the left side is in the Rashba-dominated regime, while the right side is in the strongly Zeeman-dominated regime. Moreover, let us consider an energy value inside the magnetic gap, |E| < EZ . As can be seen from Tables I and III, in this energy range there are two propagating modes and two evanescent modes on each side of the interface. Then, a scattering state has the form\n\u03a8\u0302E(x) = 1\u221a 2\u03c0~  1\u221a v+(E;\u03b1L) ( a\u0302 (L) 1E \u03c71(k+(E;\u03b1L)) e ik+(E;\u03b1L)x + b\u0302 (L) 1E \u03c71(\u2212k+(E;\u03b1L)) e\u2212ik+(E;\u03b1L)x ) + +f\u0302 (L) \u03b2EE \u03be\u03b2E (\u03ba+(E;\u03b1L))e \u03ba+(E;\u03b1L) x\nx < 0\n1\u221a v+(E;\u03b1R)\n( b\u0302 (R) 1E \u03c71(k+(E;\u03b1R)) e ik+(E;\u03b1R)x + a\u0302 (R) 1E \u03c71(\u2212k+(E;\u03b1R)) e\u2212ik+(E;\u03b1R)x ) +\n+g\u0302 (R) 2E \u03be2(\u2212\u03ba+(E;\u03b1R))e\u2212\u03ba+(E;\u03b1R) x\nx > 0\n(B1)\nwhere a\u0302 (L/R) 1E denotes the fermionic operator related to the propagating mode incoming from the left/right side (originating from the lower band \u03b2 = 1), b\u0302 (L/R) 1E describes the one related to the propagating mode outgoing to the left/right (also originating from the lower band \u03b2 = 1), with \u03c71 being the related spinor given in Eq.(A3). Similarly f\u0302 (L) \u03b2EE and g\u0302 (R) 2E are the evanescent mode operators and \u03be1, \u03be2 denote the related spinors given in Eqs.(A8)-(A9). For the Rashba-dominated side on the left, from Table I one sees that the evanescent mode originates from the lower complex band (\u03b2E = 1) for E < \u2212E2Z/4ESO and from the upper complex band (\u03b2E = 2) for E > \u2212E2Z/4ESO, whereas for the\n14\nstrongly Zeeman-dominated side on the right we deduce from Table III that the evanescent mode originates from the upper complex band (\u03b2 = 2) on the Zeeman-side. Inserting Eq.(B1) into the boundary conditions (9) at the interface x = 0, the latter can be rewritten in a matrix form as\nM (L) E (0)  a\u0302 (L) 1E b\u0302 (L) 1E\nf\u0302 (L) \u03b2EE\n0\n = M (R)E (0)  b\u0302 (R) 1E a\u0302 (R) 1E 0\ng\u0302 (R) 2E  (B2) where M\n(L/R) E (0) \u2208 C4\u00d74 are two 4\u00d7 4 complex boundary matrices at energy E given by\nM (L) E (0) =  \u03c71(k+)\u221a v+\n\u03c71(\u2212k+)\u221a v+\n\u03be2(\u03ba+) \u03be2(\u2212\u03ba+)\ni (k+\u2212\u03c3LkSO,L) \u03c71(k+)\u221a v+ \u2212i (k++\u03c3LkSO,L) \u03c71(\u2212k+)\u221a v+ (\u03ba+ \u2212 i\u03c3LkSO,L)\u03be2(\u03ba+) \u2212(\u03ba+ + i\u03c3LkSO,L)\u03be2(\u2212\u03ba+)  (B3) and\nM (R) E (0) =  \u03c71(k+)\u221a v+\n\u03c71(\u2212k+)\u221a v+\n\u03be\u03b2E (\u03ba+) \u03be\u03b2E (\u2212\u03ba+)\ni (k+\u2212\u03c3RkSO,R) \u03c71(k+)\u221a v+ \u2212i (k++\u03c3RkSO,R) \u03c71(\u2212k+)\u221a v+ (\u03ba+ \u2212 i\u03c3RkSO,R)\u03be\u03b2E (\u03ba+) \u2212(\u03ba+ + i\u03c3RkSO,R)\u03be\u03b2E (\u2212\u03ba+)  (B4) where \u03c71, \u03be1 and \u03be2 are the 2\u00d7 1 spinors in Eq.(A3), (A8)-(A9), respectively, and the dependence of \u03ba+ and v+ on \u03b1L and E [in Eq.(B3)] and on \u03b1R and E [in Eq.(B4)] has been omitted for simplicity. Moreover, we have denoted \u03c3R,L = sgn(\u03b1R,L) and we have used the fact that the second Eq.(9) at the interface x = 0 can be rewritten as\n\u2202x\u03a8\u0302(0 \u2212) = \u2202x\u03a8\u0302(0 +)\u2212 i (\u03c3RkSO,R \u2212 \u03c3LkSO,L)\u03c3z\u03a8\u0302(0) (B5) in terms of the spin-orbit wavevectors (14). From Eq.(B2), the transfer matrix relating the operators on the right side of interface to the operators on the left side, b\u0302 (R) 1E a\u0302 (R) 1E 0\ng\u0302 (R) 2E\n = WE  a\u0302 (L) 1E b\u0302 (L) 1E\nf\u0302 (L) \u03b2EE\n0  , |E| < EZ (B6) is straightforwardly found to be WE = [M (R) E (0)] \u22121M (L)E (0). Since Eqs.(B6) represent four constraints for the six unknown operators, one can express four of them in terms of the incoming operators a\u0302 (L) 1E and a\u0302 (R) 1E . In particular, one can thus compute the Scattering Matrix SE , which relates the outgoing propagating modes to the incoming ones( b\u0302 (L) 1E\nb\u0302 (R) 1E\n) = rE t\u2032E tE r \u2032 E  \ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nSE\n( a\u0302 (L) 1E\na\u0302 (R) 1E\n) (B7)\nThe transmission coefficient is computed as T (E) = |tE |2 = |t\u2032E |2 and the linear conductance in the considered range |EF | < EZ is obtained from Eq.(10).\nIn a similar way, one can find the transmission in the energy range E > EZ above the gap. In such a case, on each side of the interface there are two propagating modes and no evanescent mode on each side, so that the Scattering state solution now acquires the form\n\u03a8\u0302E(x) = 1\u221a 2\u03c0~  1\u221a v+(E;\u03b1L) ( a\u0302 (L) 1E \u03c71(k+(E;\u03b1L)) e ik+(E;\u03b1L)x + b\u0302 (L) 1E \u03c71(\u2212k+(E;\u03b1L)) e\u2212ik+(E;\u03b1L)x ) + + 1\u221a v\u2212(E;\u03b1L) ( a\u0302 (L) 2E \u03c72(k\u2212(E;\u03b1L)) e ik\u2212(E;\u03b1L)x + b\u0302 (L) 2E \u03c72(\u2212k\u2212(E;\u03b1L)) e\u2212ik\u2212(E;\u03b1L)x ) x < 0 1\u221a v+(E;\u03b1R) ( b\u0302 (R) 1E \u03c71(k+(E;\u03b1R)) e ik+(E;\u03b1R)x + a\u0302 (R) 1E \u03c71(\u2212k+(E;\u03b1R)) e\u2212ik+(E;\u03b1R)x ) +\n+ 1\u221a v\u2212(E;\u03b1R)\n( b\u0302 (R) 2E \u03c72(k\u2212(E;\u03b1R)) e ik\u2212(E;\u03b1R)x + a\u0302 (R) 2E \u03c72(\u2212k\u2212(E;\u03b1R)) e\u2212ik\u2212(E;\u03b1R)x ) x > 0 (B8)\n15\nInserting Eq.(B8) into the boundary conditions (9) and proceeding as outlined above, one can find the Transfer Matrix a\u0302 (R) 1E b\u0302 (R) 1E\na\u0302 (R) 2E b\u0302 (R) 2E\n = WE  a\u0302 (L) 1E b\u0302 (L) 1E\na\u0302 (L) 2E b\u0302 (L) 2E  (B9) whence the Scattering matrix SE , which is now a 4\u00d7 4 matrix, can straightforwardly be obtained b\u0302 (L) 1E b\u0302 (L) 2E\nb\u0302 (R) 1E b\u0302 (R) 2E\n = rE t\u2032E tE r \u2032 E  \ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\nSE\n a\u0302 (L) 1E a\u0302 (L) 2E\na\u0302 (R) 1E a\u0302 (R) 2E\n (B10)\nwith t, t\u2032 and r, r\u2032 denoting the 2\u00d7 2 transmission and reflection blocks. The transmission coefficient is now obtained as T (E) = tr[t\u2020EtE ] = tr[t \u2032 \u2020 E t \u2032 E ].\nGeneralization to multiple interfaces. It is straightforward to generalise the same approach to the case of N interfaces. Let us consider an interface located at xj separating a region with RSOC \u03b1j (on the left side) from a region with RSOC \u03b1j+1 on the right, as depicted in Fig.10. Similarly to the single interface problem [see Eqs.(B1) and (B8)], on each side of the interface the electron field operator \u03a8\u0302E(x) is written as an expansion of (at most) four modes, which can be propagating or evanescent, depending on the specific regime of that region and on the energy range, according to Tables I, II, III. Denoting by c\u0302 (j) E , d\u0302 (j) E , f\u0302 (j) E , and g\u0302 (j) E the operators related to the above four modes on the j-th region and the boundary conditions (9) can be rewritten in a matrix form\nM (j) E (xj)  c\u0302 (j) E d\u0302 (j) E\nf\u0302 (j) E g\u0302 (j) E\n = M (j+1)E (xj)  c\u0302 (j+1) E d\u0302 (j+1) E\nf\u0302 (j+1) E g\u0302 (j+1) E\n (B11)\nThe transfer matrix across the interface at xj is obtained as WE(xj) = [M (j+1) E (xj)] \u22121M (j)E (xj). Then, by observing that the operators on right of the interface xj are the very same operators as the ones on the left of the interface at xj+1 (see Fig.10), the total transfer matrix WE across the entire inhomogeneous scattering region c\u0302 (N) E d\u0302 (N) E\nf\u0302 (N) E\ng\u0302 (N+1) E\n = WE  c\u0302 (0) E d\u0302 (0) E\nf\u0302 (0) E g\u0302 (0) E\n (B12)\n16\ncan be easily found as the product WE = \u220fN\u22121 j=0 WE(xN\u2212j\u22121). For instance, for the doubly gated NW problem of Sec.V, the total transfer matrix is the product WE = WE(x1)WE(x0) of the two single-interface transfer matrices and contains the distance d = x1 \u2212 x0 between the two interfaces at x0 and x1. Finally, one observes that in the outer region j = 0 (left lead) the modes propagating rightwards (leftwards) are incoming to (outgoing from) the scattering region and can thus be relabelled as a\u0302 (L) \u03b2E (b\u0302 (L) \u03b2E ). Moreover, in order to ensure the normalizability of the state, only the evanescent mode decaying to the left is admitted, like in Eq.(B1). Effectively, this means that in Eq.(B11), the operator related to the mode diverging on the left has to be set to zero, like in Eq.(B6). Similarly, in the outer region j = N (right lead) the modes propagating leftwards (rightwards) are incoming (outgoing) and are relabelled as a\u0302 (R) \u03b2E (b\u0302 (R) \u03b2E ), while only the evanescent mode decaying on the right, if any, is admitted. Implementing these aspects in Eq.(B11), and re-expressing the outgoing mode operators b\u0302 (L) \u03b2E , b\u0302 (R) \u03b2E in terms of the incoming ones a\u0302 (L) \u03b2E , a\u0302 (R) \u03b2E , one finds the Scattering Matrix similarly to what was done in Eqs.(B7) and Eqs.(B10) for the single interface case.\n\u2217 fabrizio.dolcini@polito.it 1 R.

This can be seen by performing the gauge transformation \u03a8\u0302 \u2192 \u03a8\u0302\u2032 = \u03c3z\u03a8\u0302 on the electron field in the Hamiltonian Eq.(1), which maps the case of Zeeman field +h\u22a5 into the case \u2212h\u22a5. 74 Bound states localized at the interface may exist, but they are energetically located below the continuum, not in the magnetic gap range (see Ref.[60]). 75 L.
