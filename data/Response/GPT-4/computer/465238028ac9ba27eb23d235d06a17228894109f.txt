Exploration of Seismic Noise Below 1 Hz: The current array configurations are not suitable for exploring frequencies below 1 Hz, which could provide more information about the dynamics of the hydrothermal system. Future research could focus on deploying arrays with larger apertures or utilizing different seismic array configurations that enable the study of lower frequency bands. This could help to better understand the subsurface processes at greater depths or the interaction between the hydrothermal system and the regional tectonic setting.

Integration of Seismic Data with CO2 Flux Measurements: The paper highlights the lack of direct association between seismic wavefield components and degassing activity due to the absence of CO2 flux measurements during the array functioning period. Future studies could integrate continuous CO2 flux measurements with seismic data to directly correlate seismic signatures with variations in degassing rates. This multidisciplinary approach would improve the understanding of the link between seismic activity and fluid dynamics.

Detailed Study of the Influence of Meteorological Parameters on Seismicity: The research points out a potential relationship between seismic noise and meteorological parameters, especially rainfall. Future work could involve installing more meteorological stations closer to seismic monitoring sites to accurately capture local weather conditions. This would allow for a more detailed investigation of how weather conditions, particularly rainfall and wind intensity, influence seismic signal and hydrothermal system dynamics.

Expansion of the Seismic Network Around Mefite Area: The study suggests that a larger number of seismic stations in and around the Mefite emission site could greatly aid in understanding hydrothermal tremors. Future research could focus on expanding the seismic network to cover a broader area with dense, small aperture seismic arrays. This would enable a more detailed mapping of seismic sources and could help to distinguish between different sources of seismic noise, including anthropogenic, hydrothermal, and tectonic components.

Investigation of Deep Origin Fluids' Influence on Local Seismicity: The research discusses the deep origin of CO2 emissions at the Mefite site and their potential influence on local seismicity. Future studies could aim to explore the relationship between deeply generated fluids, their ascent through the crust, and their impact on seismic activity. This could involve modeling fluid migration pathways, assessing the role of fault systems in fluid migration, and studying the interaction between fluid pressure changes and seismicity. Such research would contribute to a better understanding of the complex interactions between deep mantle processes, fluid dynamics, and earthquake generation.
