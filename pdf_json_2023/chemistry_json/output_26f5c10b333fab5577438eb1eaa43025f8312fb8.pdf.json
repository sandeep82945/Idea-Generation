    "abstractText": "Ticks and tick-borne diseases constitute a substantial hazard to the livestock industry. The rising costs and lack of availability of synthetic chemical acaricides for farmers with limited resources, tick resistance to current acaricides, and residual issues in meat and milk consumed by humans further aggravate the situation. Developing innovative, eco-friendly tick management techniques, such as natural products and commodities, is vital. Similarly, searching for effective and feasible treatments for tick-borne diseases is essential. Flavonoids are a class of natural chemicals with multiple bioactivities, including the inhibition of enzymes. We selected eighty flavonoids having enzyme inhibitory, insecticide, and pesticide properties. Flavonoids\u2019 inhibitory effects on the acetylcholinesterase (AChE1) and triose-phosphate isomerase (TIM) proteins of Rhipicephalus microplus were examined utilizing a molecular docking approach. Our research demonstrated that flavonoids interact with the active areas of proteins. Seven flavonoids (methylenebisphloridzin, thearubigin, fortunellin, quercetagetin7-O-(6-O-caffeoyl-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside), quercetagetin-7-O-(6-O-p-coumaroyl-\u03b2-glucopyranoside), rutin, and kaempferol 3-neohesperidoside) were the most potent AChE1 inhibitors, while the other three flavonoids (quercetagetin-7-O-(6-O-caffeoyl-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside), isorhamnetin, and liquiritin) were the potent inhibitors of TIM. These computationally-driven discoveries are beneficial and can be utilized in assessing drug bioavailability in both in vitro and in vivo settings. This knowledge can create new strategies for managing ticks and tick-borne diseases.",

Cattle farmers worldwide are becoming increasingly concerned about the spread of the southern cow tick, Rhipicephalus microplus (formerly Boophilus microplus). When a cow tick bites an animal, it can transmit disease-causing microbes such\nMolecules 2023, 28, 3606. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28083606 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 3606 2 of 20\nas Babesia bovis, Babesia bigemin, and Anaplasma marginale, causing the animal to grow slowly, produce less milk, or even die [2]. R. microplus control has emerged as a central concern and area of attention in animal parasitology research and technology development due to its global distribution and impact on cattle husbandry [3]. While chemical acaricides have effectively reduced R. microplus populations, their widespread use has resulted in acquired resistance, making population control less likely [4]. Multiple cases of R. microplus acaricide resistance have emerged in recent years, making the global spread of acaricide resistance a major concern for the cattle industry [5]. As a result, research into new chemicals with distinct mechanisms of action and acaricidal efficacy against R. microplus is ongoing. Moraes et al. investigated the physiological mechanisms underlying tick embryo formation to develop new tick population control strategies [6]. They found that morphogenetic alterations in R. microplus embryos were linked to the predominant energy source [6]. While R. microplus embryos develop in 21 days, they are syncytia until the fifth day. On the sixth day, zygotic expression becomes active, and the embryo assumes control over its development [7]. There seem to be two separate metabolic stages during cellularization, with major changes occurring in the glycolytic and gluconeogenic pathways [8]. Triose-phosphate isomerase (TIM), an enzyme involved in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, catalyzes the interconversion of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. The therapeutic development of TIM has shown promise against several human-pathogenic parasites [9,10]. These include Plasmodium falciparum, Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma cruzi, Giardia lamblia, and Fasciola hepatica. TIM is a (\u03b2/\u03b1)8-barrel protein, a core of eight parallel \u03b2-strands and eight \u03b1-helices on all sides. Banner et al. found TIM\u2019s \u201cTIM-barrel\u201d crystal structure [11]. Moraes et al. were the first to investigate TIM\u2019s kinetic and structural properties from embryos of R. microplus [6]. Their study suggested that many cysteine residues in R. microplus TIM (RmTIM) could be used to make antiparasitic drugs. In addition, selective inhibitors can be created by targeting this enzyme\u2019s less conserved interface [12]. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE1) (E.C. 3.1.1.7.) is a synaptic enzyme and a major target of both organophosphates (OPs) and carbamates [13]. It is essential for the transmission of nerve impulses in both vertebrates and arthropods [14,15]. AChE1 inhibits nerve impulses by breaking acetylcholine into acetate and choline [16]. AChE1 is inhibited by the acaricides carbamate and OPs. Carbamates and OPs pesticides both inhibit AChE1 activity by binding to the esterasic and anionic sites of the enzyme. Both suppress the enzyme\u2019s activity in a similar mode of action [17,18]. Various flavonoids and their derivatives have been found to possess inhibitory potential on AChE in Caenorhabditis elegans and Spodoptera litura [19], as well as electric eels (Electrophorus electricus) [20]. The majority of the organic compounds produced by plants do not appear to contribute to their growth and development. The distribution of secondary metabolites, or flavonoids, varies considerably between taxonomic plant groups [21]. The interaction of flavonoids with proteins and nucleic acids has resulted in the development of numerous bioactive compounds with pharmacological, antibacterial, and insecticidal properties. Since flavonoids are used as pesticides in medicine and agriculture, they are significant. Therefore, they could be useful in a pest control program [22]. The primary objective of computational approaches such as molecular docking and in silico absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) analyses is to screen potential flavonoids against RmTIM and R. microplus AChE1 (RmAChE1) in numerous databases and libraries. Computational screening reduces the time and resources required for experimental testing in pharmaceutical research. Utilizing computational designs and molecular information on flavonoid compounds, research into the development of effective alternatives to currently used acaricides may benefit from the wide variety of flavonoids by selecting the most promising compounds. Additionally, medicinal chemistry is frequently used to identify new bioactive molecules with acaricidal applications. For example, to identify RmTIM and RmAChE1 inhibitors, natural substances from numer-\nMolecules 2023, 28, 3606 3 of 20\nous databases and libraries were screened using knowledge of parasiticides and enzyme inhibitors."

            "text": "Nowadays, synthetic insecticides are often employed to eliminate veterinary and pharmaceutical pests. Pest resistance, the product remains, active component withdrawal, environmental persistence, and nontarget dangers need new solutions. One approach uses plant-based chemicals\u2019 toxic, irritant, or beneficial qualities. These compounds have limited human harm, short environmental persistence, and complicated chemistry, making them ideal pesticide candidates [28]. New bioactive compounds that are more potent and selective for tick targets have been explored as potential solutions to these problems [29]. In silico methods like molecular docking, homology modeling, and molecular dynamics make it easier to find novel compounds that bind to parasites\u2019 molecular targets [30]. The neuronal enzyme AChE1, which catalyzes the breakdown of acetylcholine, is a recognized chemical target of ticks [31]. It causes neuromuscular paralysis and death by prolonging the tick\u2019s neural excitation. Moreover, TIM is an enzyme involved in both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis since it catalyzes the conversion of 3-phosphoglycerate to dihydroxyacetone phosphate. To generate selective inhibitors, one must target the enzyme\u2019s interface, which is poorly conserved between species, even if the structural similarity of the enzyme is well conserved across species [12]. However, whether a specific molecular inhibitor of RmTIM has a flavonoid structure or any other structure is still unknown. Antiparasitic activity and enzyme inhibition are two important biological effects that piqued modern interest in the flavonoid family of natural secondary metabolites. Plant products\u2019 acaricidal efficacy has been connected to the presence of flavonoids. Ghosh et al. discovered that adult Ricinus microplus might be destroyed in vitro by an ethanolic extract of Ricinus communis leaf containing flavonoids (quercetin, flavone, and kaempferol) [32]. In addition, the active fractions of Ocotea aciphylla leaf containing a flavonoid (vitexin2\u2032\u2032-O-rhamnoside 9) showed in vitro anti-tick efficacy against larvae of R. microplus [33]. Flavonoids\u2019 capacity to bind to enzymes like AChE1 is another important biological characteristic. Researchers have shown that flavonoids (quercetin, rutin, narigin, and hesperidin) may inhibit AChE1 from Electrophorus electricus in vitro [34,35]. In silico and in vitro studies have shown scopoletin and diosmin to inhibit mouse AChE1 [36]. Despite this, there is a lack of research on plant flavonoids\u2019 effect on the acaricidal effectiveness of RmAChE1 and RmTIM proteins.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 3606 15 of 20\nPlant flavonoids\u2019 docking with the RmAChE1 and RmTIM proteins was examined in this work. Docking analysis requires a protein\u2019s 3D structure. Since the structure of the RmAChE1 protein has not been identified experimentally, we constructed a model of this protein using the homology modeling approach, widely accepted as the best technique for modeling proteins. The structure of RmTIM was obtained from the PDB. Multiple webbased tools assessed the accuracy and stereochemistry of the RmAChE1 model developed by the computer. Docking analysis requires a protein structure file in (.pdb) format. Docking analysis foretells a compound\u2019s binding energy to a protein and the optimal molecular orientation for binding. Our primary objective in this work was to determine whether natural flavonoids had any effect on the RmAChE1 and RmTIM proteins. This study retrieved 80 flavonoid structures from PubChem and PubMed. After that, these flavonoids were put through a virtual screening using MOE software, which tested them against both proteins. Ten flavonoids, including methylenebisphloridzin, thearubigin, fortunellin, quercetagetin-7-O-(6-O-caffeoyl\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside) 1, quercetagetin-7-O-(6-O-p-coumaroyl-\u03b2-glucopyranoside), rutin, kaempferol 3-neohesperidoside, quercetagetin-7-O-(6-O-caffeoyl-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside) 2, isorhamnetin, and liquiritin were obtained as potential inhibitors (the flavonoids 1\u20137 against RmAChE1; the flavonoids 8\u201310 against RmTIM) based on best docking scores against the active sites of both proteins of R. microplus. Many different pharmacological effects, such as antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, anti-hyperglycemic, anti-cancer, antibacterial [37], AChE1 inhibitory [19], enzymatic [38], hepatoprotective [39], and antioxidant [40], may be applicable. Furthermore, we determined the drug-likeness properties using the available online tool SwissADME comprised of pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics and, ultimately, provided the prediction regarding absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) in the human body like a drug. We incorporated the drug-like calculation based on the Lipinski rule of five to determine oral absorption or membrane permeability (Table 2). Following Lipinski\u2019s rule of five and the concept of QED, as outlined in Table 2, all the designed compounds violated more than one rule, except Isorhamnetin and Liquirtin, which did not violate any rule. This implies that the MW, RB, HBD, HBA, TPSA, and iLOGP of some compounds fall within the acceptable range. Additionally, only one PAINS alert was identified for compounds 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8, indicating their specificity. Thus, it can be concluded that these active anti-tick compounds (1 to 10) possess an average pharmacokinetic profile. The DFT results also revealed that both compounds (isorhamnetin and liquiritin) have better chemical reactivity and kinetic stability with considerable intramolecular charge transfer between electron-donor and electron-acceptor groups. The molecule with a higher band gap was less polarizable and showed high kinetic stability and low chemical reactivity (hard molecule). The band gap shown by the complex was lower than the obtained band gaps of liquiritin, which makes it more reactive towards the affected area. While in the case of isorhamnetin, the band gap of complexes was more than isorhamnetin itself, which makes it stable and reactive. This much smaller band gap of complex predicts the need for a small quantity of energy to get excited from ground level [41]. The stability and biological activity of flavonoids can be influenced by temperature, and their sensitivity to heat treatment can vary based on their chemical structure. Generally, glycosylated flavonoids exhibit more excellent heat treatment resistance than aglycone flavonoids [42]. Although the mechanism is unknown, incorporating acyl groups has been found to increase the thermostability of flavonoids [43]. For instance, Ishihara and Nakajima conducted a study where quercetin-3-glucoside was monoacylated in vitro using nine different aromatic carboxylic acids. The resulting flavonoids showed improved thermostability and light resistivity [44]. Based on our findings, flavonoids may function as inhibitors of the RmAChE1 and RmTIM proteins. Researchers studying plant flavonoids may gain new insight into their abilities to inhibit the RmAchE1 and RmTIM for treating R. microplus infection. Further\nMolecules 2023, 28, 3606 16 of 20\nresearch on flavonoid inhibition may lead to their use as acaricides in creating novel antiparasitic medications."

To prepare the TIM protein structure for molecular docking, crystal water molecules were eliminated. Some residues were missing in the structure of TIMs, so we constructed the missing residues using a loop modeler implemented in MOE software. Since the 3D structure of the RmAChE1 protein was not reported, we needed to model the structure of RmAChE1. The amino acid sequence of RmAChE1 was retrieved from uniport https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/ (accessed on 11 June 2022) under accession No. A0A0F6P2D6 RHIMP and then modeled using SWISS-MODEL https://swissmodel. expasy.org/interactive/ (accessed on 12 June 2022). To identify appropriate templates for constructing the 3D structure of RmAChE1, a sequence similarity search was carried out using the NCBI BLAST against the PDB database. Sequence alignment analysis was conducted through the Clustal Omega server [45]. In addition, the stereochemical quality of the modeled structure of the test protein was validated using the PROCHECK, Verify3D, and ERRAT services."

            "text": "RmAChE1 lacks a determined 3D structure, and thus its active site has not been experimentally identified. Therefore, we utilize site finder, a computational tool implemented in the molecular operating environment, to evaluate the potential active site. These site prediction tools provide a theoretical assessment of the active site in RmAChE1. In addition, TIM is a dimeric protein comprising two individual monomers, each containing a TIM barrel structure. The active site responsible for the catalytic activity is situated within this TIM barrel. Given the high similarity of the catalytic sites among all TIM structures, a set of catalytic residues was selected for further investigation through molecular docking studies."

The structures were saved as (.mol) files. Atoms of hydrogen were incorporated into the structural optimization conducted with MOE software. We could use these characteristics to reduce the energy of specific molecules (gradient: 0.05, force field: the Merck molecular force field 94\u00d7 (MMFF94\u00d7), chiral constraint, and current geometry). The revised flavonoid structures were then incorporated into the molecular docking database (.mdb) for docking analysis."

            "text": "Our research elucidated the structure and interactions of cattle tick proteins with plant flavonoids. In the last decade, flavonoids have been the subject of much research. Their potential health benefits have also been explained beyond their nutritional value. Newly discovered 3D structures of RmTIM and RmAChE1 have acceptable stereochemical and energetic qualities, allowing for the prediction of novel inhibitors. This research aims to evaluate the efficacy of flavonoids from medicinal plants as acaricides against proteins produced by the parasite R. microplus. The seven flavonoids (methylenebisphloridzin, thearubigin, fortunellin, quercetagetin-7-O-(6-O-caffeoyl-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside) 1, quercetagetin-7-O(6-O-p-coumaroyl-\u03b2-glucopyranoside), rutin, and kaempferol 3-neohesperidoside) were docked against RmAChE1, proving their strong interaction. This work will help make and evaluate flavonoids as tick acaricides to prevent tick-borne illnesses.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28083606/s1, Supplementary Figure S1: Two-dimensional (2D) structures of flavonoid compounds; Supplementary Figure S2: The molecular docking of RmAChE1 showed binding sites with quercetagetin-7-O-(6-O-caffeoyl-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside) in (A) 3D and (B) 2D pictures; Supplementary Figure S3: The molecular docking of RmAChE1 showed binding sites with quercetagetin-7-O-(6-O-p-coumaroyl-\u03b2-glucopyranoside) in (A) 3D and (B) 2D pictures; Supplementary Figure S4: The molecular docking of RmAChE1 showed binding sites with rutin in (A) 3D and (B) 2D pictures; Supplementary Figure S5: The molecular docking of RmAChE1 showed binding sites with kaempferol 3-neohesperidoside in (A) 3D and (B) 2D pictures.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, A.K.
