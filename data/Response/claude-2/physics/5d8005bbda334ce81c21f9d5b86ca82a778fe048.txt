 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Explore the stability and properties of helium clathrate hydrates with other cage structures besides sII, such as sI or sH. The multiple cage occupancy effects may differ. 

2. Investigate the dynamics and diffusion of multiple helium atoms inside the clathrate cages using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. This could provide insights into the guest-host interactions.

3. Study the substitution effects of helium with other noble gas atoms like neon or argon. How does the size and polarizability affect the multi-occupancy and stability?

4. Examine the co-occupancy of helium with other small molecules like hydrogen or methane. The interactions between different guest molecules may impact the cage filling capacities. 

5. Develop machine learning models, as suggested in the paper, to predict multi-occupancy configurations and stabilities based on the computational data. This could accelerate screening and discovery of optimal clathrate structures.
