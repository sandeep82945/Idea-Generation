INTRODUCTION\nGaining control over electron spin degree of freedom is very much desirable in the field of spintronic research1,2. In recent days, spin-orbit interaction (SOI) has been found to provide promising strategy for electrical manipulation spin/magnetism in spintronic devices3\u20136. This includes the creation of spin current from transverse charge current effect (SHE)7\u20139, and the exertion of a torque on a local magnetization from electrical current by spin-orbit torque effect10\u201313. At a microscopic level, the asymmetric spin dependent electron scattering induced by SOI lies at the heart of the above phenomena14,15. Besides, a broader implication of SOI is realized in the design of topological materials with their potential use in low energy dissipation and faster magnetization switching16\u201319. Materials with high Z element (Z is atomic number) are ideal candidates to look for spin-orbit interaction induced phenomena (SOI strength \u221dZ4 20). In particular, 5d transition metal Pt has drawn lot of attention for spin-charge conversions and spin-torque effect in Pt/magnetic layer based hetrostructures due to its intrinsic high SOI21\u201324. Further, the observation of inverse spin hall effect (ISHE) (reverse process of SHE, i.e. creation of charge current from transverse spin current) in Ni81Fe19/Pt and in Pt wire at room temperature provided an effective way to detect spin current25,26. In view of the extensive use of Pt in spintronics owing to its chemical inertness, easy fabrication of device and most importantly strong intrinsic spin-orbit interaction, it is important to have a comprehensive understanding of the effect of spin-orbit interaction on electronic transport in bare metallic Pt thin films.\nQuantum interference originated weak-localization (WL) or weak-antilocalization (WAL) effect is very much sensitive to the spin-orbit interaction (SOI) scattering process in conducting systems27. In real system, any type of deviation from perfect crystalline structure\nacts as a source of scattering potential for itinerant electrons. Scattered electrons propagating along timereversed, identical self-intersecting trajectories known as \u201cCooperon loop\u201d (CL)28,29 interfere constructively/ destructively to give rise to suppression (WL)/ enhancement (WAL) of conductivity. Experimentally, WL/WAL is usually determined from conductance correction to classical Drude conductivity at low temperature and in presence of external magnetic field. The interference correction tends to vanish for most of trajectories after averaging over the random scattering potentials, except for those scattered electrons which propagate in CL.\nThe application of uniform external magnetic field breaks the time reversal symmetry required for the interference effect and induces an additional relative phase shift (due to enclose magnetic flux) between the two electrons traversing CL . This effect suppress constructive/destructive interference, as a result conductance gets enhanced (positive)/decrease (negative) with application of magnetic field in the WL/WAL regime30,31. Therefore, variation of magnetoconductance is used as a sensitive probe to detect quantum interference effect. Traditionally, the manifestation of WAL has been attributed to SOI in material. In order for WAL to occur, it is crucial to have a \u03c0 phase shift between two electron trajectories. The rotation of spin 1/2 particle by 4\u03c0 is equivalent to the identity operation. However, for Pt thin films 2\u03c0 rotation of itinerant electron spin induced by SOI gives rise to \u03c0 phase shift resulting in WAL effect32,33.\nIn this work, we have carried out an indepth magnetotransport study to examine the underlying SOI scattering of itinerant electrons from WAL effect in Pt thin films. It has been realized that SOI scattering strength (proportional to the characteristic spin-orbit magnetic field (Bso \u223c 2 T)) is very much stronger than coherent phase breaking scattering strength (B\u03c6 \u223c 0.004 T at 2 K). The corresponding Bso and B\u03c6 are extracted by using Hikami-Larkin-Nagaoka equation (Eq.7). Fur-\nar X\niv :2\n20 9.\n06 76\n8v 1\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .s\ntr -e\nl] 1\n4 Se\np 20\n22\n2 ther, it has been found that the single conduction channel can not be fitted well with experimental data, rather two independent conduction channels need to be considered to reconcile with experimental data. To get more information about channels and their orbital symmetry, we examined temperature dependent behavior of B\u03c6. It is found that B1\u03c6(T ) for one channel exhibits prominent temperature dependence whereas B2\u03c6(T ) corresponding to other channel shows weak temperature dependence. The observed difference in the temperature variation of B1\u03c6(T ) and B 2 \u03c6(T ) are attributed to two conducting channels made of orbitals with different symmetry. The band originated from more symmetric orbitals are less sensitive to disorder whereas the band originated from anisotropic orbitals are more sensitive to disorder and it is reflected in temperature dependent B1\u03c6(T ), B 2 \u03c6(T ). The observed effects are consistent with theoretical predication that\nthere exist three Fermi-sheets (FS) with one s and two d orbital character34\u201336. This study provides the evidence of two independent nonsimilar conducting channels (one channel is made of s orbital FS and other is originated from combining two d orbital FS (illustrated in Fig.9)) and presence of anisotropic spin-orbit interaction along with e-e correlation in Pt thin films."

The extracted coefficient A for different B\u22a5 is shown in the inset.\nelectrons (l\u03c6 >> le). One of the indications of quantum interference correction is ln(T ) dependence of sheet conductance (\u2206\u03c3QI) in 2D limit (l\u03c6 > t, where t is film thickness) and in general, for N independent conducting channels or Fermi sheets, \u2206\u03c3QI can be expressed as 42\u201344,\n\u2206\u03c3QI(T ) = N\u03b3int\u03b1p e2\n2\u03c02~ ln(T/T0) (2)\nwhere \u03b3int is related with interaction coupling strength among independent Fermi sheets (strong coupling and zero coupling lead to N\u03b3int \u223c 1 and N\u03b3int \u223c N respectively), p is related with temperature exponent of phase coherence length (l2\u03c6 \u221d T\u2212p 45\u201347), T0 depends on le and \u03b1 takes different values depending upon dominant scattering process involved. For three extreme situations \u03b1 follows as: \u03b1 \u223c \u22121/2 in strong spin-orbit scattering with absence of magnetic impurity scattering (WAL), \u03b1 \u223c 1 in quantum coherent regime (l\u03c6 > le) in absence of spin-orbit and magnetic impurity scattering (WL), \u03b1 \u223c 0 in strong magnetic impurity scattering (which drives towards classical scenario)42. Therefore, the coefficient of ln(T ) in Eq.(2), AQI = N\u03b3int\u03b1p e2\n2\u03c02~ contains crucial information about microscopic scattering process. Further, EEI contribution to sheet conductance (\u2206\u03c3e) exhibits also similar ln(T ) dependence. For N independent\nchannels in 2D limit, it can be expressed as48\u201352,\n\u2206\u03c3e(T ) = N e2\n2\u03c02~ (2\u2212 2F ) ln(T/Te) (3)\nwhere F is averaged screened Coulomb interaction over Fermi surface, normalized with zero momentum transfer in EEI scattering process. Therefore, total correction to (\u03c3total) can be expressed as,\n\u2206\u03c3total(T ) = A e2\n2\u03c02~ ln(T/T\n\u2032 ) (4)\nwhere A = N(\u03b3int\u03b1p+ (2\u2212 2F )) and T \u2032\nis a constant. Hence, it is not straight froward to extract the value of \u03b1 from zero magnetic field \u2206\u03c3(T ) vs ln(T ) experimental data, when the contribution from quantum interference and EEI coexist. To overcome this issue, one needs to exploit the temperature dependence of sheet conductance at constant weak magnetic fields since it will suppress mainly quantum interference contribution.\nQuantum interference effect (WL/WAL) originates from particle-particle channel interaction between two electrons traversing in \u201cCooperon loop\u201d (CL) and it is very much sensitive to enclosed magnetic flux through the CL due to applied external magnetic field. However, EEI effect is governed by particle-hole channel interaction and it can not be influenced by external weak magnetic field48(EEI can be influenced in higher magnetic field if g\u00b5B B > 1/\u03c4so, where \u03c4so, g and \u00b5B are SOI scattering time, Lande-g factor and Bhor-magneton respectively)43,52\u201356. As a consequence of the above fundamental differences between quantum interference effect (WL/WAL) and EEI, one can disentangle WL/WAL and EEI contribution by applying (perpendicular to film surface) constant weak external magnetic fields. The applied field will suppress WL/WAL contribution, while EEI effect remains unaffected. Hence, the change in ln(T ) coefficient upon the application of weak magnetic field will provide only WL/WAL contribution (i.e. AQI in Eq.(2)).\nWe investigated the variation of ln(T ) coefficient (A) in \u03c3(T ) with applying constant perpendicular external magnetic fields ranging from 0 - 0.8 T, shown in Fig.2. A systematic change in A was observed with the increment of external constant magnetic field and we obtained maximum change in ln(T ) coefficient as AQI = A|B=0\u2212A|B=0.8 = \u22120.56 (in quantum conductance unit, e2/2\u03c02~). To evaluate the value of \u03b1 from AQI that contains the information about dominant scattering process, one requires to know the values of N\u03b3int and p. The p adapts a universal value depending upon the dominant interaction responsible for inelastic scattering process in the system. In particular, for EEI originated inelastic scattering, l\u22122\u03c6 (l \u22122 \u03c6 \u221d T p) exhibits linear temperature dependence at low-temperature and it shows a crossover from T to T 2 ln(T ) behavior with the increment of temperature47.\nTwo possible cases can be invoked to assess the value of \u03b1: (i) For Pt thin films, resistivity follows quadratic\n4 temperature dependence (14 K < T < 23 K) (Sec:III) which signifies the dominance of electron-electron scattering over electron-phonon scattering and gives rise to p = 1 at lower temperature. Considering single channel N = 1 or strong coupling interaction N\u03b3int \u223c 1, one can obtain \u03b1 \u223c \u22121/2 (Eq.2). (ii) Effective two independent channels N = 2 and p = 1 (extracted from magnetoconductance analysis, Sec:V A) give rise to \u03b1 \u223c \u22120.28 (Eq.2).\nFrom detailed magnetotransport analysis (discussed in Sec:V), it is realized that the conduction takes place through two independent channelsN = 2 in Pt thin films. Considering two channel conduction, Eq.2 provides the value of \u03b1 = \u22120.56/(N\u03b3intp) = \u22120.56/(2 \u00d7 1) \u223c \u22120.28 (as discussed above) which is very much unexpected for high spin-orbit coupled system. To find out the source of this discrepancy, we re-looked into how the explicit temperature dependence arises in the sheet conductance correction (Eq.2) due to quantum interference effect. One can primarily visualize that with the increment of temperature, random thermal agitation enhances the inelastic scattering among itinerant electrons and as a consequence, l\u03c6 becomes temperature dependent (explicit functional form is determined by the dominating scattering mechanism (e-e, e-phonon scattering) at non zero temperature). The l\u03c6 fixes the upper cut-off spatial dimension for quantum interference effect and the interference originated correction is proportional to the available coherence area (\u221d l2\u03c6). Thus, for single channel with phase coherence length l\u03c6, \u2206\u03c3QI \u221d \u2212 ln(l2\u03c6/l2e). On the contrary, dominant impurity induced inelastic scattering leads to temperature independent l\u03c6\n57 and such kind of conducting channel can not contribute to \u2206\u03c3QI(T ) considerably. Therefore, for a system with N non-similar independent conduction channel, \u2206\u03c3QI(T ) can be expressed as,\n\u2206\u03c3QI(T ) = \u2212\u03b1 N\u2211 n=1 e2 2\u03c02~ ln((ln\u03c6/l n e ) 2). (5)\nIt has been observed from magnetoconductance analysis that the examined Pt thin films possesses two independent conducting channels, one of which shows prominent temperature dependence (B1\u03c6(T ) \u221d T , Fig.3) at lower temperature regime (2 K < T < 6 K), and B2\u03c6(T ) associated with other channel follows a negligible variation with temperature. This implies that contribution to the slope of ln(T ) (Eq.5) from second channel is negligible. Thus, Eq.5 can effectively be converted into\n\u2206\u03c3QI(T ) = \u2212\u03b1 e2\n2\u03c02~\n( ln(l1\u03c6/l 1 e) 2 + ln(l2\u03c6/l 2 e) 2 )\n= \u2212\u03b1 e 2\n2\u03c02~\n( ln(l1\u03c6(T )/l 1 e) 2 + ln(l2\u03c6(T )/l 2 e) 2 )\n\u223c \u03b1 e 2\n2\u03c02~\n( ln(T/T 10 ) + c ) (6)\nwhere, c is a temperature independent constant as l2\u03c6 exhibits negligible temperature dependence. Since only one channel contributes logarithmic temperature correction to \u2206\u03c3QI(T ), we obtained \u03b1 = \u22120.56/(N\u03b3intp) = \u22120.56/(1\u00d7 1) \u223c \u22121/2 which is consistent with theoretical value of \u03b1 in presence of strong spin-orbit scattering.\nWe now turn into the estimation EEI strength which is related with screened Coulomb potential F . For strong interaction, F is small fractional number and for free electrons F \u223c 1. F can be evaluated by considering that at a magnetic field of 0.8 T, the quantum interference effect is completely exhausted and then one can approximate the coefficient A|B=0.8T \u223c N \u00d7 2(1 \u2212 F ) = 1.22, (N = 2 as discussed before) which leads to F \u223c 0.7. The 5d correlated transition metal Pt exhibits higher value of F which indicates e-e Coulomb interaction is weaker in comparison with strongly electron correlated 3d transition metal Cu FCu \u223c 0.558."

Further, spin-orbit scattering magnetic field B1so \u223c 2 T , B2so \u223c 2.5 T are found to be very much higher than both B1\u03c6, B 2 \u03c6.The obtained fitting parameters provide the following physical interpretations: (i) the Pt metal possesses large intrinsic spin-orbit interaction Bso \u223c 2 T (in perpendicular configuration with integer number channels N = 2), (ii) presence of two independent conducting channels in Pt thin film, and (iii) the variation of B1\u03c6 with temperature is very much prominent in comparison with the B2\u03c6 and B 1 \u03c6 < B 2 \u03c6.

            "text": "It was predicted from a theoretical band structure calculation that Pt metal (electronic configuration 5d96s1) has three sheets of Fermi surfaces which are comprised of s-band and two from d-band34. We realised the pres-\nence of two independent conduction channels from our magneto-transport analysis in both perpendicular and parallel magnetic configurations. This apparent discrepancy (theoretically three channels, experimentally two channels) leads to an insightful physics of Pt thin film in presence of weak disorder scattering which is unavoidable in real system. The two d-band channels are mixed up with each other due to their similar orbital nature and in presence of intermixing scattering, they will act as an equivalent single channel. On the contrary, intermixing scattering among s, d-band channels is very weak due to different orbital symmetry. As a result effectively there will be two independent conducting channels which is illustrated in Fig.9. Secondly, we have found that the characteristic magnetic field for coherence phase breaking scattering (B2\u03c6) corresponding to one channel shows a weak temperature dependence and this intriguing phenomena could arise very often in a system with significant impurity scattering. However, B1\u03c6 for other channel shows a prominent variation with temperature, indicating the the presence of effectively weak impurity scattering. The crucial point is that the same amount of disorder in a system can act differently for different conduction channels depending upon it\u2019s orbital symmetry. The bands derived from more anisotropic orbitals (e.g. d, p orbital) are very much sensitive to minute amount of disorder68,69 which can give rise to very high inelastic scattering in comparison to conducting channel made out of symmetric orbitals (e.g. s orbital). To conclude, the symmetry of orbitals involved in conducting channels, presence of EEI and anisotropic spin-orbit interaction are revealed from our magnetoconductance study in Pt thin films."

Therefore, intutively non-integer value of independent channel may arise for intermediate (small but non-negligible) inter-orbital scattering strength. 64 H. Nakamura, D. Huang, J. Merz, E.
