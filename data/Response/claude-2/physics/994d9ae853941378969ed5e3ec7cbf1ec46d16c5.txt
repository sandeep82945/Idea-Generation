 Here are 5 potential future research directions based on the paper:

1. Investigate the effect of varying zinc and thiocyanate concentrations on the pH-driven phase transitions between hexameric and dimeric insulin. This could provide further insight into the role of GluB13 repulsions in driving the transitions.

2. Solve the structure of the cubic insulin polymorph at higher resolution using single crystal X-ray diffraction. This could reveal more detailed structural differences compared to previous cubic insulin structures. 

3. Explore the stability and activity of the different N-terminal conformations of the B chain (Oc, Ic, O, T states) to understand their functional relevance.

4. Conduct molecular dynamics simulations on the hexameric insulin structures to complement the dimer simulations and gain a fuller picture of the conformational dynamics. 

5. Extend the pH range studied to more extreme acidic or basic conditions to check for additional conformational changes or phase transitions.
