conclusion and future work The concept of ‘universal precautions’ have been suggested as being applicable to the prescribing and administration of opioids in the perioperative period (Lee et  al. 2017; Macintyre et  al. 2014) and encompass strategies at each stage of a patient’s perioperative
journey to ensure that the lowest dosage, shortest acting opioids are used for the shortest possible time, while ensuring good analgesia and patient satisfaction. This will be used as an underpinning principle for our ongoing work. This project forms part of the wider YCRBCIP program for use in the improvement of outcomes for patients with bowel cancer undergoing surgery. We have identified a set of quality indicators which may help to improve quality of care for patients undergoing major abdominal surgery for bowel cancer who receive perioperative opioids.
