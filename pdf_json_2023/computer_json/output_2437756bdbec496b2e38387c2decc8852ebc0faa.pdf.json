I have written this note because it doesn\u2019t seem to be well known that the set-theoretical model of Go\u0308del\u2019s system T fails to be fully abstract. By the context lemma, full abstraction is equivalent to the statement that the substructure of definable elements is extensional; that is, that any two definable functionals that agree on definable arguments must agree on all arguments. Kreisel gave a counter-example to this, reported in [1, page 581, Exercise 1] by Barendregt. A ground-valued definable functional that is constant on definable arguments but non-constant on arbitrary arguments is exhibited.\nThe surprise in the construction is that exhaustive search over the onepoint compactification of the discrete natural numbers is definable in system T . Once one knows this, it is straightforward to produce the counterexample, using the well-known fact that definable functionals 2N \u2192 2 are continuous with respect to the discrete topology on 2 and the product topology on 2N. The connection with exhaustive search is in fact made explicit in Exercise 2 of [1, page 581]. We propose a slight improvement of the suggested solution, and use this to formulate Kreisel\u2019s counter-example.\nSystem T . We take system T to be the simply typed lambda-calculus with base types for natural numbers (including zero, successor and higher-type primitive recursion) and booleans (including if-then-else).\nThe set-theoretical model. The set theoretical model interprets the type of natural numbers as the set N of natural numbers and the type of booleans as the set 2 = {0, 1}, with the convention that 0 is false and 1 is true. Function types are interpreted as exponentials in the category of sets (=sets of all functions).\nThe one-point compactification of N. Let\nN\u221e = {x \u2208 2 N | \u2200i \u2264 j.xi \u2264 xj} = {n\u0304 | n \u2208 N} \u222a {\u221e},\nwhere we write n\u0304 = 0n1\u03c9 and \u221e = 0\u03c9. The last equation requires classical logic but we don\u2019t worry about this (see below). The argument given below uses the fact that definable functions 2N \u2192 2 are continuous with respect to the discrete topology on 2 and the product topology on 2N (Cantor space), and the fact that \u221e = limn n\u0304 in this topology. Notice that the pointwise order on N\u221e restricts to the natural order on N and has \u221e as a top element. For \u03b1 \u2208 2N, denote by \u03b1 + 1 the sequence 0\u03b1. Then n\u0304 + 1 = n+ 1 and \u221e+ 1 = \u221e.\nExhaustive searchability of N\u221e. Define \u03b5N\u221e : 2 2 N \u2192 2N by\n\u03b5N\u221e(p)(i) = 1 iff p(n\u0304) for some n \u2264 i.\nBecause the bounded existential quantification can be reduced to primitive recursion, this is T -definable. By construction,\n\u03b5N\u221e(p) = \u00b5n.p(n\u0304) if p(n\u0304) for some n \u2208 N,\nand \u03b5N\u221e(p) = \u221e if there isn\u2019t n \u2208 N such that p(n\u0304).\nOr, combining these two statements,\n\u03b5N\u221e(p) = inf{x \u2208 N\u221e | p(x)}\nbecause the infimum of the empty set is always the top element. Hence the image of \u03b5N\u221e is N\u221e, and\np(\u03b5N\u221e(p)) iff p(x) for some some x \u2208 N\u221e.\nIn the terminology of [2], the set N\u221e is searchable. Notice that \u03b5N\u221e implements search even for discontinuous p.\nKreisel\u2019s counter-example. Define test : 22 N \u2192 2 by\ntest(f) = f [inf x \u2208 N\u221e.f(x+ 1) = f(\u221e)] = f(\u221e) =\u21d2 f(0\u0304) = f(\u221e).\nBy the above, this is T -definable. If f : 2N \u2192 2 is continuous, then test(f) holds, because there is n \u2208 N such that f(n\u0304) = f(\u221e) as limn n\u0304 = \u221e. Hence the functional test is constant on T -definable arguments. However, test(f) fails for f defined by\nf(\u03b1) =\n{\n1 if \u03b1 = \u221e,\n0 otherwise,\nbecause in this case [inf x \u2208 N\u221e.f(x+ 1) = f(\u221e)] = \u221e and hence\nf [inf x \u2208 N\u221e.f(x+ 1) = f(\u221e)] = f(\u221e) but f(0\u0304) 6= f(\u221e).\nA fully abstract model. Kleene\u2013Kreisel functionals (exponentials in kspaces starting from discrete natural numbers and booleans) are an example, using the fact that the Kleene\u2013Kreisel density theorem gives dense sequences which are actually definable in system T .\nClassical logic. The above argument relies on classical logic (in a weak form: a sequence is either \u221e or not). This is necessarily the case. From a fully abstract model, taking presheaves one gets a topos (model of bounded set theory based on intuitionistic logic) that gives an equivalent fully abstract model!\nAcknowledgements. When I posed the question, Gordon Plotkin answered that Barendregt knew a counter-example in the late 1970\u2019s, and Alex Simpson later told me where to find it."
