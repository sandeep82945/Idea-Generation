    "abstractText": "Background: Skipped multifocal spinal tuberculosis (TB) is an atypical presentation of spinal TB. Surgical treatment for these unusual cases remains a challenge for spine surgeons. In our institute, we used single\u2010stage circumferen\u2010 tial debridement and anterior reconstruction with fibular allograft followed by posterior instrumentation through posterior\u2010only approach for these patients. This study aimed to determine the efficacy and feasibility of this technique. Methods: Twelve patients with skipped multifocal spinal TB who received our treatment method from January 2012 to June 2020 were enrolled in this study. The visual analog score (VAS), laboratory data, comorbidities, complications, and neurologic status based on Frankel scale were recorded. The patients\u2019 clinical conditions were evaluated based on modified Brodsky\u2019s criteria and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Results: All the patients were infection free at the end of the treatment. The average VAS score was 7.5 (range, 7\u20138) before surgery and decreased to 2.1 (range, 1\u20133) one year postoperatively. No one experienced any severe complica\u2010 tions such as neurologic deterioration, fixation failure, or bone graft dislodgement. Out of the three patients requiring debridement surgery, two had wound infection and one had seroma formation. The ODI score improved from 76.8 (range, 70\u201384) preoperatively to 25.5 (range, 22\u201328) one year after surgery. All patients achieved good or excellent outcome based on modified Brodsky\u2019s criteria one year postoperatively. Conclusions: In our study, the patients could achieve a good clinical outcome. This technique could be an alterna\u2010 tive for patients with skipped spinal TB.",

All patients achieved good or excellent outcome based on modified Brodsky\u2019s criteria one year postoperatively.\nConclusions: In our study, the patients could achieve a good clinical outcome. This technique could be an alterna\u2011 tive for patients with skipped spinal TB.\nKeywords: Fibular allograft, Single posterior approach, Skipped infection, Spinal tuberculosis\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

Management for these patients is still a challenge for clinicians because the spine structure could be severely destroyed by TB infection resulting in spinal instability, kyphotic deformity, neurologic injury, and even paralysis [2]. There is still no standard protocol for treating such patients [3].\nConservative management with anti-TB chemotherapy is considered as the first line of treatment [3]. Most patients can be cured by a strict and standardized treatment protocol using anti-TB medications. However, surgical intervention is indicated in patients with progressive\n*Correspondence: edaspine@gmail.com\nDepartment of Orthopedic Surgery, E\u2011Da Hospital/I\u2011Shou University, No. 1, E\u2011Da Road, Kaohsiung City 82445, Taiwan\nneurologic deficit, spinal instability, extensive paravertebral or epidural abscess, and severe spine deformity [4]. The goal of surgery is not only extensive debridement for the infective tissue but also decompression of neurologic elements, correction of deformity, reconstruction of spinal structure, and restoration of stability for early mobilization. Although numerous operative methods have been proposed for such patients, there are still controversies as to which one is better [5].\nSkipped multifocal spinal TB is defined as at least two separate levels of spinal infection which is considered as an atypical manifestation of spinal TB [6]. A higher incidence of neurologic deficit resulting in an increased requirement for surgical interventions was reported [6]. The multifocal distribution of infection foci could also increase the complexity during operation. It is troublesome to manage all infective levels through an anterior approach, and multiple incisions may be required. Posterior decompression and instrumented fusion had been reported to treat spine TB successfully and seems to be an alternative to manage this atypical condition [7, 8]. However, it is difficult to achieve a good reduction of kyphotic deformity, ensure complete eradication of infective tissue over the anterior column, and enable comprehensive decompression of neurologic elements as the compression could be located either anteriorly or posteriorly. Furthermore, the stability may be insufficient without using a strut bone graft or body spacer for anterior support. Until now, there are only few reports mentioning about the surgical management of patients with noncontiguous spine TB and no consensus exists [6, 9\u2013 11]. In our institute, we used the single-stage technique through a posterior-only approach with circumferential decompression and anterior column reconstruction using fibular allografts to treat patients with skipped spinal TB over the thoracolumbar spine since 2012 [12]. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of this technique through a retrospective review of patients\u2019 medical records who underwent surgery."

Of these, 13 were diagnosed with skipped spinal TB. One patient died seven months after the index surgery due to myocardial infarction and was excluded as he could not complete a one-year follow-up. After the study was approved by the institutional review board and informed consent was obtained from each patient, medical records of remaining twelve patients\u2019 were reviewed retrospectively.\nAll 12 patients had symptoms of progressive back pain which could not be controlled by painkillers and bracing. Neurologic deficit with Frankel C to D was noted in 10 cases. The diagnosis was based on the clinical presentation, pathologic reports, microbiology laboratory results, and magnetic resonance imaging of spine (Fig.\u00a01). Conservative methods were prescribed for each patient as first line of treatment. Single-stage surgery through posterior approach was performed after the conservative methods failed. Radiographic assessment was carried out before and after surgery, at the 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month visit after discharge, and every year thereafter. The inflammatory markers which included C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were checked regularly to monitor the status of infection control until spinal TB was cured. All 12 enrolled patients were followed up for at least 18\u00a0months after undergoing the surgical procedure."

The posterior complex was exposed followed by inserting transpedicular screws into two levels above and two levels below the infective vertebrae. For patients with the 5th lumbar or sacral involvement, iliac screws were introduced to achieve an adequate fixation. One rod was placed temporarily for keeping the spine stable to prevent further neurologic injuries by vibration during surgery (Fig.\u00a02A). The temporary rod was placed on the contralateral side of planned allograft insertion, which was determined by the findings of preoperative imaging studies and neurologic examination, as it could influence the transpedicular debridement and access for allograft insertion. Sometimes, extensive debridement is indicated and, in this case, bilateral transpedicular debridement was required. In this situation, another rod on the opposite side was placed followed by releasing the previous fixed one after we finished the procedure on one side. Therefore, decompression and debridement on both sides could be achieved without creating undesired vibration."

Finally, all the patients were cured from TB infection. No one experienced any severe complication such as neurologic deterioration, fixation failure, or bone graft dislodgement. No obvious nonunion or pseudoarthrosis of fibular allograft was detected on radiographic examinations. Neurologic deficits with Frankel C to D were noted in 10 patients preoperatively. One year postoperatively, only two patients still had abnormal neurologic functioning with Frankel D (Table\u00a02). Two patients suffered from poor wound healing and local infection. Hence, they received surgical debridement and wound repair followed by antibiotics. Another patient received debridement surgery because of seroma formation.

            "text": "Spinal TB is defined as a chronic infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis which most commonly affects the thoracolumbar junction but the whole spine could be involved [2\u20135]. It is usually caused by hematogenous spread of offending pathogen from the primary infection site, most common in pulmonary region or genitourinary system [14], to the vasculature of vertebral bodies. As the reputation of a great mimicker in medicine, the clinical pictures of spinal TB are varied with a wide range from insidious back pain to severe spinal deformity, neurologic deficit, and even paralysis [1\u20133]. The non-specific manifestation makes timely diagnosis, the most crucial part for successful treatment and avoiding complications, remain a challenge for clinicians. Typically, the presentations in images involve destruction of the vertebral bodies and intervertebral disk space, collapse of the spinal structures, and anterior wedging leading to kyphosis and gibbus deformity. However, many atypical features have been reported in the literature.\nPande et\u00a0 al. presented a new classification of atypical spinal TB and described that noncontiguous lesion is one of the atypical manifestations [15]. This atypical condition is not uncommon with the reported incidence ranging from 1.1 to 16.3% in the literature [16]. Kaila et\u00a0al. even reported an incidence up to 71.4% by reviewing the whole spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of 14 patients [17]. Several possible reasons had been mentioned to explain the high incidence of skipped spine TB. First, it may be related to embolic spread of bacteria to multiple levels of vertebrae which is similar to the phenomenon of multiple metastasis in tumor cases [18].\nSecond, Batson\u2019s paravertebral venous plexus, a valve-less system in the vertebrae, allows the spread of infection along it and is considered as a reason in developing noncontiguous lesions [19]. However, this is still controversial and the real reason remains unclear.\nConservative management with multiple anti-TB drugs is the mainstay in managing spinal TB because varying categories of bacilli could exist. It could also reduce the instance of drug resistance. According to the recommendations of WHO, four drugs: isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, or streptomycin, are administered for two months in the initiation phase followed by two drugs\u2014isoniazid and rifampicin, for seven months in the continuation phase. Kanamycin, amikacin, capreomycin, levofloxacin, etc., are considered as second-line drugs and should be used carefully as they are expensive and have more side effects [13]. However, the adequate treatment should be individualized and should be based on patients\u2019 conditions, response to treatment, and results of culture. In our case series, we followed a\ntreatment protocol with multidisciplinary team care as it could improve the outcomes [20, 21]. Eventually, all the patients could be cured from spinal TB.\nSurgery for spinal TB is usually reserved for patients with (1) refractory disease, (2) severe kyphosis, (3) pan-vertebral lesions, (4) progressive neurologic deficit, and (5) clinical deterioration [1\u20135]. The operation is commonly accessed through the anterior retroperitoneal or transthoracic approach for debriding the infective tissue and decompressing neurologic elements comprehensively. Then, the anterior column was reconstructed using autograft, allograft, or vertebral body spacers. For obtaining an immediate stability, supplemental posterior instrumentation after anterior column reconstruction in a single- or two-stage manner could be carried out through additional posterior approach [22, 23]. This combined surgery is the most secure procedure for patients with severe deformity, instability, and neurologic deficit. However, the major concerns for this combined approach are (1) longer operative time, (2) greater"

Due to the above-mentioned reasons, this is not an ideal technique, especially for patients who are older or with multiple comorbidities because it may hurt such fragile cases.\nTo decrease the morbidities and disadvantages related to the combined approach, the technique through a posterior-only approach in single-stage manner had been proposed. Circumferential debridement, decompression of neurologic elements, and even total or subtotal corpectomy followed by anterior reconstruction could be carried out through the posterolateral transpedicular approach without sacrificing the nerve roots. The blood loss, operative time, surgery-related complications, and length of hospitalization can be reduced. In addition, most of the surgeons are more familiar with the posterior instead of anterior approach, and revision surgery is much easier if necessary. This technique had been used to treat a wide range of spinal disorders and resulted in a satisfactory outcome [25\u201327].\nAutograft, allograft, or vertebral body spacer could be used for anterior column reconstruction after circumferential debridement through transpedicular approach. Different pros and cons exist in each choice, and there is still no consensus in which one is better [28\u201330]. Autogenous iliac or fibula strut bone graft is an ideal choice for anterior column reconstruction during spine surgery as it is osteo-inductive and osteo-conductive, biomechanically stable, and biocompatible. However, the major concern of using autogenous strut bone graft is the high incidence of donor site morbidities [31, 32]. The need for creating another wound followed by an additional procedure for\nharvesting the bone graft can cause discomfort in these fragile patients. An expandable cage is another recommended choice as it could be passed through the route between the nerve roots and then easily be expanded to adequate length [33, 34]. However, it is not an ideal alternative due to the lack of osteo-inductive and osteo-conductive properties. In our case series, we used allogenic fibular bone graft to reconstruct the anterior column. We chose fibula because the size is suitable for inserting it anteriorly through the route between nerve roots. The major advantage of allograft is that it eliminates the need for additional surgical procedure and prevents donor site morbidities. However, there are some disadvantages related to allograft which included accelerated bone resorption, delayed vascular penetration, slow bone formation, and incomplete or delayed graft incorporation. Some authors also had reported a good outcome by using allograft to reconstruct spinal structure [30]. In the present study, none of our patients experienced an allograftrelated complication and achieved good outcome."
