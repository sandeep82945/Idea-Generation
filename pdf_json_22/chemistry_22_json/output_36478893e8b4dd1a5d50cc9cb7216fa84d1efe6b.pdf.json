    "abstractText": "Besides their extremely useful properties as solvent, ionic liquids (ILs) are now considered to be highly instructive tools for enhancing the rates of chemical reactions. The ionic nature of the IL anion and cation seems to be the origin of this fascinating function of ILs as organocatalyst/promoter through their strong Coulombic forces on other ionic species in the reaction and also through the formation of hydrogen bonds with various functional groups in substrates. It is now possible to tailor-make ILs for specific purposes as solvent/promoters in a variety of situations by carefully monitoring these interactions. Despite the enormous potentiality, it seems that the application of ILs as organocatalysts/promoters for chemical reactions have not been fully achieved so far. Herein, we review recent developments of ILs for promoting the nucleophilic reactions, focusing on fluorination. Various aspects of the processes, such as organocatalytic capability, reaction mechanisms and salt effects, are discussed.",

Introduction\nIonic liquids (ILs) have found a wide range of applications in various fields of chemistry (organic, physical, medicinal, analytical and materials chemistry) because of their unique and useful physicochemical properties. In addition to being excellent solvents (due to high polarity) and environmentally benign solvents (because of low volatility, no metallic element, and easy recovery) ionic liquids are also gaining importance as catalysts/promoters in various chemical transformations [1\u201316]. Significantly enhanced reactivity and selectivity have also been observed in concerted reactions such as nucleophilic substitution reactions in ionic liquids [14\u201316]. By combining a variety of cations and anions with characteristic structures, it is possible to tailor-make task-specific ILs with desirable properties for specific chemical reactions [15,17\u201328]. Nucleophilic fluorination [13,14,16,29\u201340] has received considerable attention recently because of the importance of the synthesis of radiopharmaceutical substances to be used as diagnostic materials for the powerful technique of positron emission tomography (PET) [32]. Because the SN2 fluorination processes need not deal with the cumbersome F2 gas, they are advantageous over the electrophilic methods. There are two critical issues here, however, concerning the counter-cation and solvent (Scheme 1). First, the common use of bulky counter-cations such as tetrabutylammonium (TBA+) may minimize the harmful Coulombic influence on the nucleophile, but usually suffers from a large amount of by-products (for example, E2 products). Alkali metal cations such as K+ or Cs+ may be more desirable, but these sources of fluoride exhibit the problem of solubility in organic solvents. Moreover, the strong electrostatic influence of alkali metal counter-cations was thought to decrease the reactivity of nucleophiles significantly. Second, protic solvents (water, alcohol), which are deemed to be favorable with regard to the solubility for alkali metal fluorides, were\nMolecules 2022, 27, 5702. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules27175702 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2022, 27, 5702 2 of 17\nconsidered to be disadvantageous for nucleophilic reactions due to the hydrogen bonding between the \u2013OH of solvent molecules and the nucleophile.\nMolecules 2022, 27, 5702 2 of 18 metal fluorides, were considered to be disadvantageous for nucleophilic reactions due to the hydrogen bonding between the \u2013OH of solvent molecules and the nucleophile. These two traditional \u2018common senses\u2019 for nucleophilic fluorination proved to be inaccurate in a series of recent investigations [13,14,16,32\u201339]: It was observed that the use of metal fluorides in combination with Lewis base promoters (oligoethylene glycol [33], tbutanol, t-amyl alcohol [38]) may lead excellent SN2 yields (>90%) in reasonable reaction time (<6 h). As the key to the mechanism of this class of phenomenally efficient and selective nucleophilic fluorination, it was proposed [32,33,36,37] that the solvents and/or promoters act as Lewis bases on the counter-cation, mitigating the unfavorable Coulombic influence of the latter on the nucleophile, thereby producing essentially \u2018naked\u2019 nucleophile.\nIn this respect, ILs were regarded as excellent solvent for metal fluorides, completely solving the problem of solubility of alkali metal fluorides (MFs). Due to the ionic nature of ILs, they can also be highly desirable promoters for nucleophilic fluorination using MFs. The IL cations and anions may facilitate the SN2 fluorination processes through their strong Coulombic interactions with MF, and also through the formation of hydrogen bonds with various functional groups in substrates. Here, in this brief review, we describe the studies for IL-promoted nucleophilic fluorination that provided important advances in this very useful technology. Both experimental and theoretical (mechanistic) investigations are treated to encourage further developments. This review is not exhaustive, but discusses various features (efficacy of ILs, mechanism, salt effects, IL derivatives, etc.) of IL-facilitated fluorination.\nScheme 1.

They observed that for nucleophilic fluorination of 2-(3-methanesulfonyloxypropyl)naphthalene (Scheme 2), the IL [bmim][BF4] tremendously increased the reaction rates. Using catalytic amounts (0.5 equiv) of [bmim][BF4] was enough to almost complete the reaction over 12 h with excellent SN2 yields (>85%) (Table 1). They also found that a small amount of water did not much affect the reaction, suggesting that the organocatalysis by ILs did not require anhydrous conditions. They also tried other ILs, finding similar results with the exception of [bmim][NTf2] in CH3CN (Table 2).\nScheme 1.

Promotion of SN2 Fluorination by ILs Using Alkali Metal Fluorides\nKim, Song and Chi [14] reported in 2002 the first case of SN2 reactions using KF or CsF facilitated by ILs. They observed that for nucleophilic fluorination of 2-(3-methanesulfonyloxypropyl)naphthalene (Scheme 2), the IL [bmim][BF4] tremendously increased the reaction rates.

They also tried other ILs, finding similar results with the exception of [bmim][NTf2] in CH3CN (Table 2). Studies for other metal fluorides by these authors showed that the reaction rates depended strongly on the alkali metal counter-cation [15]. For example, fluorination using the metal salts LiF and NaF did not proceed at all under the influence of [bmim][BF4]\nMolecules 2022, 27, 5702 3 of 17\n(Table 3). This observation is, of course, due to the difference in the Coulombic influence of the alkali metal counter-cations on the nucleophile (Li+ > Na+ > K+ > Rb+ > Cs+): The Coulombic attractive forces between the alkali metal cation Li+, Na+ and F\u2212 are so strong [36] that the influence of the IL on Li+ and Na+ was not enough for facile reactions. In fact, to the best of our knowledge, the use of Li+ or Na+ as a counter-cation has not been successful so far for SN2 fluorination. Kim, Song and Chi applied this methodology to a variety of substrates, observing similar acceleration rates for a wide range of SN2 processes. These authors also proposed [13] that the role of ILs for enhancing the rates of nucleophilic substitution reactions was as an amphiphilic \u201celectrophile-nucleophile\u201d dual activator (acting both as Lewis acid on the nucleophile and as Lewis base on the counter-cation), which was the first such mechanistic insight to the ILs as organocatalysts for SN2 reactions. According to this conception, IL cation\u2013IL anion\u2013counter-cation\u2013nucleophile\u2013substrate form a compact configuration by Coulombic forces for facile SN2 reactions. The proof for this concept in molecular detail came in 2011, as described below.\nMolecules 2022, 27, 5702 3 of 18\nStudies for other metal fluorides by these authors showed that the reaction rates depended strongly on the alkali metal counter-cation [15].

Mechanistic Features of IL-Facilitated SN2 Fluorination Using Metal Fluorides\nA rough inspection for catalysis of nucleophilic fluorination (and also other nucleophilic processes involving the nucleophiles other than F\u2212) by ILs may look quite puzzling for two apparent reasons: First, the ionic liquid cation may slow the reactivity of F\u2212 due to its strong Coulombic influence on F\u2212. Second, the ionic liquid anion may try to stay as far away as possible from F\u2212 also because of the repelling electrostatic interactions with F\u2212.\nMolecules 2022, 27, 5702 6 of 17\nA clue to solving this difficulty of interpreting the experimental observed promotion by ILs came from the mechanism of SN2 reactions using alkali metal/nucleophile complexes facilitated by bulky protic solvents (t-butanol, t-amyl alcohol) and oligoethylene glycols. In contrast with conventional account of SN2 processes, the \u2013OH groups in these promoters do not act as Lewis acids on F\u2212 (thus, retarding the reactions), but as Lewis bases on the alkali metal counter-cation to alleviate the latter\u2019s harmful electrostatic influence on F\u2212, thereby producing an almost \u2018naked\u2019 nucleophile. This new mechanistic feature of SN2 processes was able to explain lots of experimental observations for the new class of SN2 reactions using KF or CsF in the presence of bulky alcohols and oligoethylene glycols. According to this mechanistic conception, an alternative feature of ionic interactions among the IL cation, IL anion, alkali metal cation (K+ or Cs+) and F\u2212 would be envisioned: (1) the IL cation may not only interact with F\u2212 but also with the IL anion, and thus these latter Coulombic interactions may significantly weaken the IL cation\u2019s retarding influence on F\u2212. (2) the IL anion, as Lewis bases, may act on K+ or Cs+ that mitigate the strong Coulombic influence of the alkali metal counter-cation, just as the O atoms of protic solvent molecules or of oligoethylene glycols. These strong interactions among the four ionic species may also help the formation of a pre-reaction complex and transition state that is highly favorable for SN2 attack of F\u2212, hence the observed high SN2 selectivity. Song and co-workers [13] discussed a range of chemical reactions to elucidate the origin of \u2018positive effects of ionic liquids on catalysis\u2019. The authors developed their concepts based on the \u2018stabilization of highly reactive intermediates\u2019 (vinyl cations, arenium cations, oxygen radical anions, etc.), formation of more reactive catalytic species for rare earth triflate catalyzed reactions, and \u2018stabilized transition state\u2019 for nucleophilic fluorination in ionic liquids. Song and co-workers\u2019 conception of the IL-assisted SN2 fluorination (ILs act as amphiphilic \u201celectrophile-nucleophile\u201d dual activator: The counter-anion of ILs acts as a Lewis base toward K+, drastically reducing its electrostatic effects and thereby \u2018freeing\u2019 the nucleophile F\u2212 and the acidic C2-proton interacts with the mesylate leaving group, helping it to detach from the reactant) was confirmed by Oh et al. [37] by quantum chemical calculations, treating the nucleophilic fluorination of 2-(3-methanesulfonyloxypropyl) naphthalene with CsF. Figure 1 depicts this mechanistic feature obtained by Oh et al. for fluorination reaction [Cs+F\u2212 + C3H7OMs\u2192 C3H7F + Cs+OMs\u2212] in [bmim][OMs]. The IL cation [bmim], IL anion [OMs], nucleophile F\u2212, counter-cation Cs+ and the leaving group of the substrate form a very compact cyclic structure. The counter-cation Cs+ binds both to F\u2212 and the leaving group -OMs, allowing an ideal configuration for the nucleophilic attack to be formed. The role of the IL cation [bmim] and IL anion [OMs] for accelerating the reaction is clearly seen: [OMs] (and the leaving group) interacts with the counter-cation Cs+, reducing the retarding Coulombic influence of Cs+ on F\u2212 (thus \u201cfreeing\u201d F\u2212), whereas [bmim] \u2018collects\u2019 [OMs], Cs+ and F\u2212 for this ideal configuration. The role of Cs+ promoting the approach of F\u2212 to the leaving group (the substrate) and that of [OMs] (acting as a Lewis base) to neutralize the Coulombic influence of Cs+ on F\u2212 seems to be the key factor in this mechanism. In this sense, the IL anion [OMs] plays its role just as the electronegative O atoms do in nucleophilic fluorination catalyzed by oligoethylene glycols [33] and bulky alcohols [38].

Salt Effects Magnier and co-workers reported that, in their use [35] of the IL [bmim]F in solventfree environments for SN2 fluorination, using 3 equiv. of the IL significantly enhanced the reaction yield as compared with the case of IL: substrate ratio = 1:1. This observation of enhanced fluorination yield from 47 to 84% by changing the IL: substrate molar ratio from 1:1 to 3:1 (Table 6) indicated significant salt effects that require mechanistic elucidation. In the process of quantum chemical analysis, Choi and Oh [44] found a new feature for the role of IL when the IL: substrate ratio = 2:1, as shown in Figure 2: The anion F\u2212 in the second IL unit acts as an additional Lewis base on the two IL cations, not as a nucleophile, for facilitating the reaction.

They found that adding KPF6\u2212 or using 2 equiv. of KF in SN2 fluorination activated by [Bmin][PF6] significantly enhanced the rate of the reaction (Figure 3). These experimental observations were also analyzed by quantum chemical calculations by Oh and Lee [46] (Figure 4), with interpretations similar to those for Magnier and co-workers: The additional PF6\u2212 or KF plays its role as an extra Lewis base acting on the counter-cation, further reducing the unfavorable influence of the latter on the nucleophile. Thus, the mechanistic study by quantum chemical methods was able to account for the experimentalists\u2019 routine use of >2 equiv. metal salts for SN2 reactions.\nFigure 1.

Organocatalysis of Nucleophilic Fluorination by IL Derivatives Attempts were made for improving the efficacy of ILs by synthesizing and using IL derivatives. Once the role of ILs as amphiphilic \u201celectrophile-nucleophile\u201d dual activators, and specifically the action of the IL anion as a Lewis base interacting with the alkali metal counter-cation, was elucidated, then the scheme for further development would be systematic and straightforward. Several investigators indeed carried out this task [34,47\u201350]. Shinde et al. [34] functionalized ILs with the tert-alcohol moiety, resulting in the 1-(2- hydroxy-2-methyl-n-propyl)-3-methylimidazolium mesylate IL ([C1im-tOH]-[OMs]), which was tested experimentally for the SN2 fluorination with CsF. Their results showed that the selectivity and yield increased considerably in comparison to other non-functionalized ILs, as an indication that the IL unit and tert-alcohol moiety produced synergetic effects. Oh et al. reported an activation barrier (\u0394G\u2021) values of 20.8 kcal/mol when the reaction was carried out in the presence of the [C4mim][OMs] and 19.1 kcal/mol when the [C1im-tOH][OMs] was used, in agreement with the experimental yields of 32 and 100%, respectively (Table 7). Use of Oligoethylene glycolic imidazolium salts as a promoter for SN2 reactions by Kim and co-workers [47,48] is another new development toward tailormaking the ILs for specific purposes. The authors observed that these fused promoters exhibit much better efficacy for SN2 fluorination (Figure 5). The mechanisms of the synergistic effects of these IL derivatives were treated elsewhere [49]; thus, here, we provide only a succinct description: The t-BuOH unit acts as an \u201canchor\u201d to the leaving group for facile nucleophilic attack by F\u2212, rather than as a Lewis base to Cs+, also helping to decrease the retarding effects of the H-F\u2212 interactions. On the other hand, the six O atoms of the two hexaethylene glycol units in [dihexaEGmim][X] ILs coordinate K+, and the two \u2013OH groups, each from the two hexaEGs, act as an \u201canchor\u201d to the nucleophile F\u2212, thereby helping the formation of a \u2018free\u2019 nucleophile that is essentially separated from the counter-cation.\ni . l l t t iti t t N fl i ti i i 6] ti t 6 it substrate:KF:KPF6 = 1:1:1 and (b) with substrate:KF = 1:2.\n6. rganocatalysis of ucleophilic Fluorination by IL erivatives\ntte pts ere ade for i proving the efficacy of ILs by synthesizing and using IL derivatives.

Aromatic (SNAr) Fluorination of Diaryliodonium Salts Using MFs Aromatic (SNAr) [51] fluorination has profound implications with regard to the synthesis of aromatic radiopharmaceuticals that may be used as diagnostic or therapeutic agents for PET technology. One typical example would be the synthesis of [18F]F-dopa. This class of nucleophilic fluorination has been under intensive study since the development of diaryliodonium salts as very useful substrates by Pike and coworkers [52] in 1998. The efficacy of solvent/promoter ILs for fluorination of diaryliodonium salts [52\u201366], however, has not been systematically tested so far. There seems to be a great possibility that ILs could make a profound difference in the efficiency of this class of reaction, because the hypervalent I+ in the substrates may directly interact with the IL anion by the strong Coulombic force. In contrast with organic solvent, the counter-anion to I+ and the counteraction to F\u2212 may also interact with the IL cation/anion in a very complicated way. For SNAr radiofluorination, the use of weak bases such as K2CO3 is necessitated to extract 18F\u2212, which could further complicate the nature of interactions. Thus, mechanistic investigation for \u2018cold\u2019 fluorination (introduction of 19F) would be considerably easier. Discussion of (SNAr) fluorination, including metal-catalyzed processes, would require a separate review; thus, we only give a brief description of some recent developments in the organocatalysis of diaryliodonium salts using MFs, in order to stimulate experimental and theoretical studies for this promising subject.\nScheme 4 depicts the cold and hot SNAr fluorination reactions first advanced by Pike and co-workers [52], in which the hot reaction reached 80% completion after 40 min in CH3CN.

Theoretical Approaches: Supramolecule\u2013Continuum vs. QM/MM Theory Several theoretical methods have been employed to treat the promotion of nucleophilic fluorination in ILs. Since the ILs are in a liquid state, however, some simplifying models should have been adopted. One choice was the supramolecule (cluster)\u2013continuum approach, in which the IL molecules directly interacting with the substrate/metal fluoride are treated by full quantum chemical methods (mostly based on density functional theory (DFT)), whereas the rest of the infinite number of IL molecules are as continuum. The biggest merit of this approach is simplicity, and it is good for obtaining and comparing the relative Gibbs free energies of alternative reaction paths, providing the essential features of the reaction processes. Pliego [39,67] employed the molecular dynamics simulation combined with (cluster)\u2013continuum approach to treat bulky alcohols as reaction medium for SN2 nucleophilic fluorination, specifically for the solvation of alkali metal salts and the transition states in tert-butanol solution. The author found that the transition state was solvated by a cluster of four tert-butanol molecules and by a dielectric continuum (Figure 6). The free energy of activation obtained by cluster\u2013continuum calculations for CsF reaction with ethyl bromide was 28.4 kcal/mol, close to the experimental value of 28.9 kcal/mol for a similar system. This technique also seems to be promising for SN2 reactions in ILs for calculating and comparing the Gibbs free energies of activation to estimate the efficacy of promoter/catalysts and also to compare the relative feasibility of alternative reaction pathways, as demonstrated by Lee and co-workers in a series of works [32,36,37].

This technique also seems to be promising for SN2 reactions in ILs for calculating and comparing the Gibbs free energies of activation to estimate the efficacy of promoter/catalysts and also to compare the relative feasibility of alternative reaction pathways, as demonstrated by Lee and co-workers in a series of works [32,36,37]. For the supramolecule (cluster) part of the system, it would be prerequisite to\n. ti re f r 6-[18 ]fl orodopa ine ([18\nAs noted above, the use of ILs as the solvent/promoter for these SNAr fluorination processes, to the best of our knowledge, has not been attempted so far. It would be extremely intriguing to examine this possibility both experimentally and theoretically.\n8. Theoretical Approaches: Supramolecule\u2013C ntinuum vs. QM/MM Theory\nSeveral theoretical methods have been employed to treat the promotion of nucleophilic fluorination in ILs. Since the ILs are in a liquid state, however, some simplifying models should have b en adopted. One choice was the supramolecule (cluster)\u2013c tinu m ap-\nroach, in which the mole ules directly teracting wi h t e substrate/metal fluoride are treated by full quantum chemical m thods (mostly based on density functional theory (DFT)), whereas the rest of the infinite numb r of IL molecules are as continuum. The biggest meri of his approach is simplicity, and it is g od for obtaining and comparing the relative Gibbs free energies of alternative reaction paths, pr viding the es enti l features of the react on proc sses. Pl ego [39,67] employed the molecular dynamics simulation co bined with (clust r)\u2013continuum approach o treat bulky alcohols as reactio medium for SN2 nucl ophilic fluorination, sp cifically for the solvation of alka i metal salts and the transition stat s in tert-b tanol s lution. The author found that the transition st te was solvated by a cluster of four tert-butanol molecules and by a dielectric continuum (Figure 6). The free e ergy of activation btained by cluster\u2013continuum calculations for CsF reaction with ethyl bromide was 28.4 kcal/mol, close to the experimental value of 28.9 kcal/mol for a similar syste .

For the supramolecule (cluster) part of the system, it would be prerequisite to accurately calculate the weak interactions (hydrogen bonding, specifically). Thus, DFT-based methods with such capability such as M06-2X [68] would be desirable. A number of polarizable continuum methods (PCM) may be used for the treatment of solvent continuum, but the SMD method [69] was quite adequate in terms of computational cost and accuracy.\nMolecules 2022, 27, 5702 13 of 18\naccurat ly calculate the weak interactions (hy rogen bonding, specifically).

Cluster\u2013continuum solvation of KF and CsF with four tert-butanol molecules.\nAn alternative model would be the mixed quantum and molecular mechanical (QM/MM) simulation method in which the IL molecules in indirect interaction with the QM-treated part of the system are treated by MM methodology. Recent excellent simulations by Gallo and co-workers [70] are to be noticed in this regard. Figure 7 depicts the structures of the reactant, TS, and product for SN2 fluorination in [Bmim][Br]. On average, five IL units were calculated to surround the contact ion-pair KF. Thus, Gallo and coworkers\u2019 QM/MM simulation clearly illustrates that the metal salt KF reacts as a contact ion pair nucleophile in [Bmim][Br], in line with Lee and co-worker\u2019s theory [37]. The calculated Gibbs free energy of activation \u0394G\u2021 of 22~24 kcal/mol [70] for the reactions in five IL solvents are comparable to those obtained by the supramolecular\u2013continuum approach.\nA series of QM/MM simulations for reactions in ILs by Acevedo and co-workers [71\u2013 76] also exhibits the potentiality of the technique for IL-facilitated chemical transformations. Table 8 shows that the free energies of activation obtained by the semiempirical QM method PDDG/PM3 and force field for the SNAr reactions of piperidine and 2-methoxy-5-nitrothiophene are in better agreement [71] with experimental values [77] than those calculated by the supramolecular\u2013continuum approach (B3LYP/6311++G(2d,p)/PCM).

Since the aliphatic fluorination is just a small part of SN2 reactions, many advantageous properties of ILs will surely stimulate further developments in other nucleophilic reactions with a variety of substrates and organocatalysts. SNAr reactions seems to remain a largely unexplored field in this respect [79\u201382]. Experimental and theoretical examination of using ILs as solvents/promoters for efficient and selective SNAr fluorination in metal-free conditions would be highly desirable. Understanding the underlying mechanism by quantum chemical calculations will certainly help to tailor-make the ILs for aliphatic and aromatic fluorination. Development of IL derivatives containing a reinforcing (via interactions with counter-cation and/or with the leaving group) side-chain is an avenue to be further explored. Use of ILs for synthesizing 18F-labeled radiophamaceutical substances also looks promising. Although not an IL, the recently reported reaction of 18F-fluorination by a tert-butanol-integrated quaternary ammonium salt (tri-(tert-butanol)-methylammonium fluoride [83,84] shows this possibility.\nFigure 8.
