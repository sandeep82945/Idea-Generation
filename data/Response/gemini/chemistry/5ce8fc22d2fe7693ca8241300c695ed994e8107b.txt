1. **Investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the activation of ERK1/2 and JNK by CBEO.** This could be done through the use of specific inhibitors or siRNA knockdown of these proteins, followed by analysis of apoptosis and cell cycle progression.
2. **Determine the role of p38 MAPK in the antitumor effect of CBEO.** This could be done through the use of specific inhibitors or siRNA knockdown of p38 MAPK, followed by analysis of apoptosis, cell cycle progression, and the activation of other signaling pathways.
3. **Investigate the role of NF-κB in the antitumor effect of CBEO.** This could be done through the use of specific inhibitors or siRNA knockdown of NF-κB, followed by analysis of apoptosis, cell cycle progression, and the activation of other signaling pathways.
4. **Investigate the role of PKB/AKT in the antitumor effect of CBEO.** This could be done through the use of specific inhibitors or siRNA knockdown of PKB/AKT, followed by analysis of apoptosis, cell cycle progression, and the activation of other signaling pathways.
5. **Evaluate the in vivo antitumor activity of CBEO.** This could be done through the use of animal models of melanoma, followed by analysis of tumor growth, apoptosis, and the activation of signaling pathways.
