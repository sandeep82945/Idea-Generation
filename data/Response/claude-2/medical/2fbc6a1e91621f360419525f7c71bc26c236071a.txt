 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct a study to validate the Hippocratic hypertension self-care scale in other patient populations, such as different countries, age groups, or racial/ethnic groups. This could provide further evidence for its validity and applicability. 

2. Develop and test interventions to improve self-care behaviors in patients with low scores on the Hippocratic scale. This could help improve outcomes for these patients.

3. Examine the relationships between scale scores and clinical outcomes, such as blood pressure control, medication adherence, hospitalizations, etc. This could further demonstrate its clinical utility.

4. Modify the scale to be useful for patients with other chronic conditions beyond hypertension, such as diabetes or heart failure. This could expand its application to broader patient populations.

5. Conduct qualitative research through focus groups or interviews to further explore patient perspectives on self-care behaviors. This could provide additional context and depth to the quantitative findings.
