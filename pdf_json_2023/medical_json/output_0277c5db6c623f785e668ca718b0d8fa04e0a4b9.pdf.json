    "abstractText": "In this study, an XY\u03b8 position sensor is designed/proposed to realize the precise control of the XY\u03b8 position of a holonomic inchworm robot in the centimeter to submicrometer range using four optical encoders. The sensor was designed to be sufficiently compact for mounting on a centimetersized robot for closed-loop control. To simultaneously measure the XY\u03b8 displacements, we designed an integrated two-degrees-of-freedom scale for the four encoders. We also derived a calibration equation to decrease the crosstalk errors among the XY\u03b8 axes. To investigate the feasibility of this approach, we placed the scale as a measurement target for a holonomic robot. We demonstrated closed-loop sequence control of a star-shaped trajectory for multiple-step motion in the centimeter to micrometer range. We also demonstrated simultaneous three-axis proportional\u2013integral\u2013derivative control for one-step motion in the micrometer to sub-micrometer range. The close-up trajectories were examined to determine the detailed behavior with sub-micrometer and sub-millidegree resolutions in the MHz measurement cycle. This study is an important step toward wide-range flexible control of precise holonomic robots for various applications in which multiple tools work precisely within the limited space of instruments and microscopes.",

Introduction\nIn recent years, electronic devices and their components have been miniaturized in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and mobile computers [1\u20133]. In biology, micromanipulation is necessary for delicate and fragile objects, such as biological cells, microfossils, and microorganisms [4\u20137]. Micromanipulation requires tools to accurately manipulate objects and multi-axis positioners to move the tool to an appropriate position and orientation with a sub-micrometer resolution. Various tools have been developed, such as vacuum nozzles [8], microtweezers with force sensors [4,9], and grippers that use capillary force [10,11]. Regarding the multiaxis positioner, the combination of a single-axis stage driven by linear synchronous motors with linear guides and stepping motors with ball-screw mechanisms are widely used in the industry [12,13]. These machines satisfy the requirements for micromanipulation in terms of accuracy, payload, and durability. However, they are considerably larger and heavier than the tiny parts. To adapt to a wider range of applications, multiaxis positioning stages should be sufficiently compact to use multiple tools simultaneously within the limited space of various instruments and microscopes. Micromanipulation using small self-propelled robots has been studied to circumvent these problems [14\u201318]. This type of robot has three-degree-of-freedom (3-DoF) movements and is capable of holonomic movements. Therefore, it is expected to be used for\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 375. https://doi.org/10.3390/mi14020375 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/micromachines\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 375 2 of 16\nmonotonous XY-axis movement and complicated tasks, such as revolution around a tooltip within a narrow microscopic image. Various types of self-propelled robots have employed different principles and structures. Typical types of motion principles include stick\u2013slip [19\u201322], centrifugal force [23], USM [24,25], and inchworm [26]. Figure 1 shows a comparison of the representative micromanipulation robots and the XY stage [22,24,27]. These robots have distinct advantages in terms of their specific performance, such as motion range, velocity, carrying capacity, and motion resolution. The performance of the inchworm robot was above average. Therefore, this robot can perform various micromanipulation tasks.\nMicromachines 2023, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 17\nMicromanipulation using small self-propelled robots has been studied to circumvent these problems [14\u201318].

Comparison of typical micromanipulation robots and XY stage [22,24,27]. Scores are evaluated based on the reference [27] (refer to Table S1 of the Supplementary Materials for the quantitative comparison of the performances).\nPrevious research has also confirmed that the holonomic inchworm robots that we developed can be driven omnidirectionally under open-loop control [28]. However, selfpropelled robots are susceptible to external disturbances, such as unevenness in the worktable and tension from the feeding wires. Therefore, precise and fast measurement of XY\u03b8 axis displacements with the sub-micrometer resolution is important for determining the exact position and orientation of robots. Various methods have been developed to measure displacement precisely [29]. One of the most commonly used methods is pattern matching using camera images; however, this method has practical problems concerning a tradeoff among the measuring resolution, range, and cycle [30,31]. Strain gauges [32], lasers [33], and encoders [34,35] have also been used. Optical encoders are feasible as multiaxis and fast position sensors because of their short measurement cycle, long range, and high resolution. In recent years, encoders have become significantly miniaturized, allowing them to be mounted on small robots. We previously reported an outline of an XY\u03b8 displacement sensor using four optical encoders, although we omitted the evaluation of the measurement performance [28,36]. In this study, we describe the evaluation and demonstration of the precise position control of a holonomic inchworm robot in the centimeter to the sub-micrometer range. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the holonomic inchworm robot, and we evaluate the XY\u03b8 displacement sensor in Section 3.\nFigure 1.

These EMs form a closed loop via a ferromagnetic surface to obtain a sufficient magnetic force to fix the floor. PA-F, PA-B, PA-L1, PA-L2, PA-R1, and PA-R2 are piezoelectric actuators (PAs) with a mechanical displacement amplification mechanism. We arranged EM-1 and EM-2 to cross each other and connect them to the six PAs to move precisely in all directions according to the inchworm principle.\nMicromachines 2023, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 17\nThe closed-loop sequence control for a multiple-step motion in the centimeter to micrometer range and simultaneous three-axis proportional\u2013integral\u2013derivative (PID) control for a one-step motion in the micrometer to sub-micrometer range are presented in Sections 4 and 5, respectively.

It moves as an inchworm while retaining the synchronism between the rectangular forces of the two EMs and the vibrations of the six PAs. When the amplitudes of the vibrations are precisely controlled, it moves in any 3-DoF direction with a resolution of less than 10 nm. As shown in Figure 2d, the robot can move linearly in any direction and rotate around any point with precision on well-polished ferromagnetic surfaces. If one EM is fixed to the floor, the other can be precisely positioned using six PAs.\n2.3. Dynamic Model\nAs shown in Figure 2e, we defined a 3-DoF dynamic model of the robot when EM-2 was free, and EM-1 was fixed. Here, kL and kS are the spring constants of the six PAs in the compression and shear deformations, respectively. The dF is the enforced displacement of PZT-F, and dB, dR1, dR2, dL1, and dL2 are similar. EM-1 and EM-2 were connected by hinged joints at P1, P2, and P3. O1, O2, and O3 are the initial positions of P1, P2, and P3, respectively. Furthermore, x1 and y1 are the coordinates of P1; (x2, y2) and (x3, y3) similarly define P2 and P3, respectively. P is the center of gravity of EM-1. The position of P is represented by the orthogonal coordinate system used for x and y. O is the origin of P. We assume that EMs are rigid bodies. The six PAs and 3-DoF motions were determined based on the positions of P1, P2, and P3. Therefore, the PAs move to the free leg; m is the mass of the EMs, I is the moment of inertia of the gravity centers of the EMs, and r is the distance between the center and end of the EMs. From Figure 1, Newton\u2019s equations of motion for EM-1 and the related parameters are represented by Equations (1)\u2013(7).\nM .. y + K y = Ku (1)\nM = m 0 00 m 0 0 0 I/r2  (2) y =\n xy r\u03b8  (3) u \u2261\n uxuy ru\u03b8  = K\u22121Kd d (4) K =\n3(kL + kS) 0 00 3(kL + kS) 0 0 0 3(3kL + kS)/2  (5)\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 375 5 of 16\nKd = kL  \u22121 \u22121 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/20 0 \u221a3/2 \u2212\u221a3/2 \u2212\u221a3/2 \u221a3/2\u221a 3/2 \u2212 \u221a 3/2 \u2212 \u221a 3/2 \u221a 3/2 \u2212 \u221a 3/2 \u221a 3/2  (6) d = [ dF dB dL1 dL2 dR1 dR2 ]t.

Input Voltages\nSimplified voltages to the PAs for the translational motion were reported in [26]. In Equation (9), VF\u2013VR2 are the input voltages to the PAs. VF\u2013VR2 was obtained by solving Equation (1) using the approximation of harmonic oscillations with no damping. Here, the moving direction is defined as \u03c6, stride length during a half-step motion is W, half-orientation change of one step is \u0398, angular frequency of the inchworm motion is \u03c9, and the approximate proportional coefficient between the enforced displacements and voltage is C. A sinusoidal voltage was applied to the PAs up to 120 Vp-p. The offset voltage was determined to be V0 = 60 V, which is half the maximum voltage of 120 V. K1 and K2 are given by Equation (10).\n3. XY\u03b8 Position Sensor 3.1. Structure\nFigure 3 shows the proposed XY\u03b8 position sensor. Figure 3a shows a magnified view of the measurement area, and Figure 3b shows the assembly of the measurement components. As discussed previously, the robot moved on a ferromagnetic plate. Four linear optical encoders (TA-200, Technohands, Yokohama Kanagawa, Japan), each with a resolution of 0.1 \u00b5m and a maximum measurement speed of 800 mm/s, were installed on the encoder installation plate, as shown in Figure 3c.

(18) 3.4. Experimental Results\nThe measurement performance of the sensor was evaluated by comparing it with the machine coordinates of a conventional precise XY\u03b8 stage. The XY\u03b8 stage was composed of a ball-screw type precise XY stage (KOHZU, Kawasaki Kanagawa, Japan, YA10A-L1) and \u03b8 stage (KOHZU, Japan, RA04A-W01) with the repeatability of 0.5 \u00b5m and 0.002\u25e6, respectively. Figure 6a shows the experimental setup. We replaced the robot with an XY\u03b8 stage, as shown in Figure 3. We fixed the encoder installation plate above the XY\u03b8 stage to measure the XY\u03b8 displacements from a stationary coordinate system. We placed the 2-DoF scale as the measurement target at the top of the \u03b8 stage. Figure 6b shows the measurement errors of the XY\u03b8-axes when the stage moves along the X-axis. Figure 6c,d show the errors in the XY\u03b8-axes when the stage moves along the Y- and \u03b8-axes, respectively. Nonlinear errors were caused by the XY\u03b8-position sensor in the X- and Y-directions. The maximum error of the X-axis was approximately \u00b11.2 \u00b5m during the X-directional motion, and the maximum error of the Y-axis was approximately \u00b11.0 \u00b5m during the Y-directional motion. When the stage was moved along the \u03b8-axis, the errors were closer to linear. The maximum error is approximately \u00b10.04\u25e6 in the \u03b8 direction. The variations in the errors of the Y- and \u03b8-axes are shown in Figure 6b; in other words, the crosstalk errors of the XY\u03b8-position sensor. The maximum crosstalk errors were approximately \u00b140 \u00b5m and \u00b10.002\u25e6 along the Y- and \u03b8-axes. To reduce this crosstalk error, we calibrated the XY\u03b8 position sensors. We define the crosstalk error components as Cx, Cy, and \u03b80, where Cx and Cy are the eccentricities between the rotation axis of the \u03b8 stage\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 375 9 of 16\nand the geometrical center of the 2-DoF scale, \u03b80, is the posture angle of the misalignment between the axes of the sensor head and those of the 2-DoF scale. The displacements after calibration are expressed as follows:\nMicromachines 2023, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 17\n3.4.

Figure 6f,g shows those along the Y- and \u03b8-axes, respectively. As shown in the figure, we performed a calibration using Equation (19), and the crosstalk errors significantly decreased in the X- and Y-directions. However, the crosstalk errors of the \u03b8-axis in the X- and Y-directional motions did not improve significantly. The maximum residual crosstalk error of the X-directional movement was approximately 1.3 \u00b5m in the Y-direction, and that of the Y-directional movement was approximately 0.9 \u00b5m in the X-direction. In \u03b8-directional motion, the maximum residual crosstalk errors were approximately 0.15 \u00b5m and 0.25 \u00b5m in the X- and Y-direction. (See also Figure S1 for evaluating XY\u03b8-axes errors for XY\u03b8-axes simultaneous displacement for (X, Y, \u03b8) = (4000 \u00b5m, 4000 \u00b5m, 5\u25e6)).\n4. Sequence Control of Multiple Step Motions 4.1. Control Sequence\nWe demonstrated closed-loop control of star-shaped translational motion in the centimeter range. Figure 7 shows the control sequence that switches the combination of coarse and fine motions. Here, PT is the target position, and eT1 is the threshold of the distance error e for coarse motion; eT2 is the fine motion, \u03b4\u03b8T is the threshold of the orientation error \u03b4\u03b8, and W1 and W2 are the step lengths of the coarse and fine motions, respectively. We determined eT1 = 80 \u00b5m, eT2 = 15 \u00b5m, \u03b4\u03b8T = 0.06\u25e6, W1 = 60.0 \u00b5m, and W2 = 5.0 \u00b5m. The robot moved to an inchworm frequency of 100 Hz.

Experimental Results Based on the aforementioned conditions, the robot was controlled to draw a star shape with five corners as target points. The experiment was performed twice, and a map of the trajectories of the center of each robot is shown in Figure 8. As shown in Figure 8a, the first and second trajectories for each experiment almost overlapped; therefore, this mobile robot had high repeatability. In both trajectories, the average velocity was approximately 4.3 mm/s, whereas the velocity of the coarse motion was approximately 6.5 mm/s. In addition, close-up views around each corner of the first trajectory are shown. Regarding the trajectory, blue, green, and red indicate coarse, fine, and rotational motions, respectively. Considering corner four as an example, the robot first entered the range of eT1 with coarse movement, (1) Coarse1. It switched to fine movement and moved near the center of the range of eT2, (2) Fine1. If the center was within the range of eT2, the orientation angle \u03b8 was measured. If it was out of the range of \u03b4\u03b8T, as shown in this case, the orientation was corrected by rotation, (3) Rotation1. If it moved outside the range of eT2, it approached the corner again using fine movements, (4) Fine2. If both the center and orientation were within the corresponding ranges of eT2 and \u03b4\u03b8T, respectively, the robot changed to a coarse movement toward the next corner, (5) Coarse2. As represented by the areas highlighted in yellow in Figure 8, cyclic vibrations occurred along the trajectory. We confirmed that these also appeared in the fine and rotational movements during every step by observing an enlarged view of the trajectories shown in Figure 8. Therefore, it is assumed that slippages of the electromagnetic legs occur during switching between the fixing and moving legs. The plots of X, Y, and \u03b8 vs. time in Figure 8b,c show that the settling times around the corners were 0.2\u20130.8 s. We assume that the settling time can be reduced by improving the navigation sequence and motion compensation.\nFigure 7. Sequence of navigation.\n4.2.

We have also demonstrated PID control of the onestep motion from the micrometer to the sub-micrometer range. In future research, we plan to decrease the noise, obtain the frequency response, improve the pseudo-differential filter, and automatically tune the PID gains. For multiplestep motion, we plan to decrease the threshold around the target position to the sub-micrometer range to achieve more precise positioning control. We also plan to shorten the time required for precise positioning by applying motion compensation. Eliminating cyclic vibrations during the switching of the supporting leg is also an important approach for more accurate control. For precise one-step motion, we plan to develop a systematic method for obtaining PID gains and investigate more efficient control sequences, such as optimal, model-following, and acceleration feedback control.\nFigure 10.

Conclusions and Future Prospects\nThe design and experiments described in this study proved that the realization of a centimeter-sized XY\u03b8 position sensor is possible, which is sufficiently compact to attach a centimeter-sized holonomic inchworm robot and can simultaneously and precisely measure XY\u03b8 displacements, with a measuring cycle of 0.1 \u00b5s, resolution of 0.1 \u00b5m and 0.4 millidegrees, measurement accuracy of 0.06\u20130.19%, and range of 16 \u00d7 16 mm2 and \u221225\u201325\u25e6. We demonstrated the sequential positioning control of the multiple-step motion from the centimeter to the micrometer range. We have also demonstrated PID control of the on -st p motion from th micrometer to the sub-micrometer range.\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 375 14 of 16\nIn future research, we plan to decrease the noise, obtain the frequency response, improve the pseudo-differential filter, and automatically tune the PID gains. For multiplestep motion, we plan to decrease the threshold around the target position to the submicrometer range to achieve more precise positioning control. We also plan to shorten the time required for precise positioning by applying motion compensation. Eliminating cyclic vibrations during the switching of the supporting leg is also an important approach for more accurate control. For precise one-step motion, we plan to develop a systematic method for obtaining PID gains and investigate more efficient control sequences, such as optimal, model-following, and acceleration feedback control. Finally, the improvement of the calibration of the XY\u03b8 displacement sensor, reduction of the friction between the legs and floor, and reduction of the hysteretic nonlinearity of the PAs are required for more precise and faster positioning. To expand the applicability of the holonomic inchworm robot, we developed manipulators to be mounted on the robot, which can precisely manipulate minute parts, such as electronic chip components, MEMS, biological cells, microorganisms, and microfossils. We also developed a precise control method for the revolution around the manipulator tip within a narrow microscopic image. The final goal of this research is to realize the automation of a mobile robotic factory organized by multiple centimeter-sized robots equipped with various tools for the multiaxial processing of biological samples and the assembly of millimeter-sized micro-robots and mechanisms.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/mi14020375/s1; Table S1\u2014Specification and score of the representative micromanipulation robots.; Figure S1\u2014Plots of XY\u03b8-axes errors vs. XY\u03b8-axes simultaneous displacement.; Video S1 3DOF motion of holonomic inchworm robot.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, K.T., M.S. and O.F.; methodology, K.T., M.S. and O.F.; software, K.T. and M.
