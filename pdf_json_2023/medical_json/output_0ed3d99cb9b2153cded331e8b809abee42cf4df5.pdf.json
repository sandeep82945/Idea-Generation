    "abstractText": "Spontaneous stochasticity is a modern paradigm for turbulent transport at infinite Reynolds numbers. It suggests that tracer particles advected by rough turbulent flows and subject to additional thermal noise, remain non-deterministic in the limit where the random input, namely the thermal noise, vanishes. Here, we investigate the fate of spontaneous stochasticity in the presence of spatial intermittency, with multifractal scaling of the lognormal type, as usually encountered in turbulence studies. In principle, multifractality enhances the underlying roughness, and should also favor the spontaneous stochasticity. This letter exhibits a case with a less intuitive interplay between spontaneous stochasticity and spatial intermittency. We specifically address Lagrangian transport in unidimensional multifractal random flows, obtained by decorating rough Markovian monofractal Gaussian fields with frozen-in-time Gaussian multiplicative chaos. Combining systematic Monte-Carlo simulations and formal stochastic calculations, we evidence a transition between spontaneously stochastic and deterministic behaviors when increasing the level of intermittency. While its key ingredient in the Gaussian setting, roughness here suprisingly conspires against the spontaneous stochasticity of trajectories.",

It suggests that tracer particles advected by rough turbulent flows and subject to additional thermal noise, remain non-deterministic in the limit where the random input, namely the thermal noise, vanishes. Here, we investigate the fate of spontaneous stochasticity in the presence of spatial intermittency, with multifractal scaling of the lognormal type, as usually encountered in turbulence studies. In principle, multifractality enhances the underlying roughness, and should also favor the spontaneous stochasticity. This letter exhibits a case with a less intuitive interplay between spontaneous stochasticity and spatial intermittency. We specifically address Lagrangian transport in unidimensional multifractal random flows, obtained by decorating rough Markovian monofractal Gaussian fields with frozen-in-time Gaussian multiplicative chaos. Combining systematic Monte-Carlo simulations and formal stochastic calculations, we evidence a transition between spontaneously stochastic and deterministic behaviors when increasing the level of intermittency. While its key ingredient in the Gaussian setting, roughness here suprisingly conspires against the spontaneous stochasticity of trajectories.\nIntroduction. When transported by a sufficiently turbulent flow, puffs of fluid particles are known to undergo a phase of algebraic inflation R \u223c t3/2, independent from their initial size and now known as Richardson diffusion1\u201310. Beyond the law in itself, Richardson\u2019s seminal contribution is the intuition that turbulent transport requires some probabilistic modeling: The modern interpretation uses the phenomenon of spontaneous stochasticity11\u201316, which involves tracers as fluid particles advected by the fluid and subject to additional thermal noise of amplitude \u03ba17: In the vanishing viscosity limit, the multi-scale nature of turbulent flows amplifies thermal noise in such a drastic fashion, that initially coinciding particles may separate in finite time although their dynamics formally solve the same initial value problem18\u201320, hereby suggesting intrinsic nature for the underlying randomness. To date, the scenario of spontaneous stochasticity for Lagrangian separation is fully substantiated within the theory of Kraichnan flows. Kraichnan flows are minimal random ersatzes of homogeneous isotropic turbulent fields17,19,21\u201324; They are defined as white-in-time Gaussian random fields, whose spatial statistics are centered and prescribed by two-point correlation functions with algebraic decay of the kind\nC(\u03be)\u03b7 (r) = 1\u2212 |r|\u03be for \u03b7 \u2264 |r| \u226a 1, (1) and vanishing at large scales \u226b 1. \u03b7 is a scale under which the flow is smooth, analogous to so-called Kolmogorov scale: The scales \u03b7 \u2264 |r| \u226a 1 define the so-called inertial range in turbulence theory. The Hurst parameter \u03be \u2208]0; 2[ prescribes the roughness of the field, through inertial-range scaling \u2329 (v(x+ r)\u2212 v(x))2 \u232a \u223c r\u03be. In the limit \u03b7 \u2192 0, this means that the lesser \u03be, the rougher v. In this stochastic setting, spontaneous stochasticity\nessentially means that some random time accounting for the large-scale O(1) dispersion of a puff of tracers with initial size O(\u03b7) has probability 1 to be finite in limits where \u03b7, \u03ba jointly vanish. The limit describes puffs initially coalescing to a point in prescribed (quenched) space-time velocity realizations4,20. For instance, explicitly considering the relative separation R(t, r0) := X2(t,x0 + r0) \u2212 X1(t,x0) between two tracers initiated at x0,x0 + r0, a natural separation time is\n\u03c41(\u03b7, \u03ba) := inf\u2225r0\u2225=\u03b7 {t|\u2225R(t, r0)\u2225 \u2265 1} . (2)\nfrom which we interpret spontaneous stochasticity as the property\nP [\u03c41 < \u221e] \u2192 1 as \u03b7, \u03ba \u2192 0. (3)\nEven at this essential level, the presence or the absence of spontaneous stochasticity in Kraichnan flows depends on a subtle interplay between four parameters: roughness, compressibility, space-dimension, reflection rules for colliding trajectories. To highlight the effect of roughness, we focus on the unidimensional space, hence prescribing unit compressibility, with a thermal noise \u03ba = \u03b7 ensuring that colliding trajectories reflect upon collision in the limit \u03b7 \u2192 0. The only relevant parameter is then the roughness exponent \u03be: Spontaneously stochastic property (3) holds if and only if \u03be < 1. For \u03be \u2265 1, particles wind up sticking together hence producing apparent deterministic behavior17,25,26: In short, Kraichan flows suggest the mantra \u201cThe rougher, the more spontaneously stochastic\u201d. In this letter, we show that this mantra cannot be repeated in the presence of multifractality, a feature which we later also refer to as spatial intermittency. ar X iv :2 30 5.\n09 83\n9v 2\n[ ph\nys ic\ns. fl\nudy\nn] 1\n9 Ju\nn 20\n23\n2 1D multifractal Kraichnan flows. We propose a multifractal unidimensional generalization of the Kraichnan model, which prescribes the motion of N tracers particles (Xi, i \u2208 [|1;N |]) in terms of the advection-diffusion\ndXi = u \u03be,\u03b3 \u03b7 (Xi(t), dt) + \u221a 2\u03ba Bi(dt), (4)\nwhere the Bi\u2019s are independent Brownian motions and we set \u03ba = \u03b7 for the thermal noise amplitude: This scaling ensures that close-by tracers separated by at most \u03b7 diffuse away from each other. The smoothing scale \u03b7 will ultimately be taken to 0. The velocity u\u03be,\u03b3\u03b7 models turbulent advection in a rough multifractal field, prescribed by the Hurst exponent \u03be \u2208]0; 2[ and the intermittency parameter \u03b3. We use the 1D Markovian version of the spatio-temporal fields constructed by Chevillard & Reneuve27\nu\u03be,\u03b3\u03b7 (x, dt) = 1\nZ\u03b7\n\u222b\nR L(\u03be)\u03b7 (x\u2212 y) e\u03b3Y (y)W1(dy, dt),\nfor Y (y) := \u222b\nR L(0)\u03b7 (y \u2212 z)W2(dz), Z := e\u03b3\n2E(Y 2),\n(5)\nin terms of the mutually independent (1+1) dimensional Wiener process W1 and Brownian motion W2, also independent from the Bi\u2019s. The kernels L (\u03be) \u03b7 prescribe the Hurst exponent of the velocity field when \u03b3 = 0; They are here defined as convolution square roots of the correlation function\nC(\u03be)(r) =\n{ ( 1\u2212 r\u03be ) 1r<1 for \u03be > 0(\nlog 1r ) 1r<1 for \u03be = 0 . (6)\nThe subscript \u03b7 denotes a regularization over the smallscale \u03b7, in practice most easily defined using Fourier transforms26. Please note that the expressions (6) indeed represent correlation functions for 0 < \u03be \u2264 128, and we therefore restrict our analysis to this range. With this choice, Eq. (1) is then exactly and not just asymptotically satisfied. Spatial intermittency is modeled by the term M (\u03b3)\u03b7 = e\u03b3Y W1(dy, \u00b7), namely the exponentiation of a regularized fractional Gaussian field Y with vanishing Hurst exponent. This non-trivial operation reguires to be suitably normalized by the term Z = e\u03b3\n2E(Y 2) \u223c \u03b7\u2212\u03b32 . The mathematical expectation E denotes an average over the random environment Y. When \u03b3 < \u221a 2/2 \u2243 0.707, the limit \u03b7 \u2192 0 then produces a welldefined and non-trivial multifractal random distribution called Gaussian multiplicative chaos29\u201332 (later referred to as GMC). The multifractality prescribes the powerlaw scaling Sp(\u2113) := \u27e8|u(x+ r)\u2212 u(x)|p\u27e9 \u223c Cp|r|\u03b6(p) in the inertial range \u03b7 \u2264 r \u226a 1, with quadratic variation of the structure function exponents as\n\u03b6(p) = p ( \u03be/2 + \u03b32 ) \u2212 \u03b32p2/2; (7)\nThis is a signature of log-normal multifractality \u2013 see Fig. 1 for a numerical illustration using Monte-Carlo\naveraging with \u03b7 = 2\u221220, and the power law extending over almost 5 decades. Here, the originality of the field\n(a) (b)\n(5) comes from its temporal dependence. The Gaussian component is Markovian, and the random environment (5) is analogous to a Kraichnan flow when we set the intermittency parameter \u03b3 = 0. The GMC component is random but frozen-in-time: This feature will allow the spatial intermittency to play out in (4) even at the level of two-particle dynamics.\nTwo wrong intuitive assumptions on multi-scaling & spontaneous stochasticity. Eq. (7) prescribes \u03b6(2) = \u03be, meaning that for the multifractal fields (5), the two-point correlation (1) is prescribed by the Hurst exponent, independently from the intermittency parameter \u03b3. Still, our multifractal fields are rougher than their mono-fractal counterpart. This is seen qualitatively from the numerical realizations of Fig. 1 (c): Increasing \u03b3 also increases the spikiness of the signal. More quantitatively, the spatial roughness \u03beK of a single realization of the random field u\u03be,\u03b3 is tied to its scaling exponents \u03b6(p) through the classical Kolmogorov continuity theorem33,34 as\n\u03beK = 2 sup p \u03b6(p)\u2212 1 p \u2264 \u03be (8)\nFor \u03b3 = 0, the mono-fractal behavior \u03b6(p) = p\u03be/2 holds for arbitrarily large p\u2019s, and as such the exponent \u03beK\n3 identifies to the Hurst exponent \u03be. For \u03b3 \u0338= 0, though, this value is reached at pK = \u221a 2/\u03b3, which prescribes \u03beK < \u03be \u2013 see Fig 1 (d). On the one hand, because of this enhanced roughness, one could in principle expect that tracers advected in the intermittent fields (4) are more likely to exhibit non-deterministic behavior than in Kraichnan flows, following the mantra \u201cThe rougher, the more spontaneous stochastic\u201d. On the other hand, two-particle separations in the monofractal Kraichnan flows depend only on \u03b6(2) = \u03be26: One may as well expect that at least at the level of two-particle separation, one should see no effect of intermittency. We now present some formal and numerical results, to argue that none of the intuitive assumptions formulated above are in fact correct.\nFrom random fields to random potentials. We focus on the dynamics of pair separations, obtained by considering N = 2 in Eq. (4). Similar to the Gaussian case35,36, tracers advected by Eq. (4) can be interpreted in terms of particles interacting through a random pairwise potential, and whose dynamics are prescribed through the stochastic differential equation (SDE)\ndXi = 1\nZ\u03b7\n\u2211\nj=1,2\nLij (|X1 \u2212X2|) e\u03b3Y (Xj)Wj(dt)\n+ \u221a 2\u03baBi(dt)\nwith L(r) := (\n1 0\n1\u2212 r\u03be \u221a 1\u2212 (1\u2212 r\u03be)2\n) (9)\nThe matrix L is a discrete analogue to the kernels L (\u03be) \u03b7 featured in Eq. (5), except for the regularizing scale \u03b7. It corresponds to an explicit Choleski decomposition of the correlation matrix C2 := C(|Xi \u2212 Xj |)i,j=1,2 such that LLT = C2. As a SDE version of the original dynamics (4), Eq. (9) comes with two advantages. (i) At a numerical level, it allows for Monte-Carlo sampling of trajectories without the need to generate the fields of Eq. (5) at each time-step, similar to the Gaussian setting35,36. (ii) At a formal level, separation-time statistics can be obtained by means of stochastic calculus and potential theory for Markov processes, in other words Feynman-Kac-like formulas. The word formal is advisory, as the frozen-in-time GMC entering the dynamics could require cautious mathematical handling31,37,38, but this goes way beyond the scope of the present letter.\nThe paradoxical interplay between intermittency and spontaneous stochasticity. Stochastic calculus suggests that for a prescribed realization of the GMC, the pairseparation time TY1 (r) from scale r to scale 1 formally solves the boundary-value problem\nLY2 TY1 = \u22121 with TY1 (1) = 0 and \u2202rT Y 1 (\u03b7) = 0,\n(\u03b3-BVP)\ninvolving the GMC-dependent operator\nLY2 (X1, r) := e2\u03b3Y (X1)\n2Z2\u03b7\n( r\u03be + e2\u03b3\u2206Y ( 2\u2212 r\u03be )) r\u03be\u2202rr,\n(10)\nwhich features the increment \u2206Y := Y (X1 + r)\u2212Y (X1). For \u03b3 \u0338= 0, (\u03b3-BVP) features a non-trivial coupling between the pair-separation time and the underlying GMC. Because of this coupling, (\u03b3-BVP) is not closed and one cannot a priori solve it explicitly for TY1 . Setting \u03b3 = 0 retrieves the Gaussian setting and provides a statistical decoupling17,26, which makes Eq. (\u03b3-BVP)-(10) solvable. For \u03b3 \u0338= 0, we define the annealed separation-time\n\u03c41 := E ( TY1 ) , (11)\nwhere we recall that the expectation E (\u00b7) denotes an average over the GMC random environment. A non-trivial decoupling is then obtained under the mean-field Ansatz\nE ( e\u03b3\u2206Y TY1 ) = E ( e\u03b3\u2206Y ) \u03c41. (12)\nFor \u03b7 \u226a 1, (\u03b3-BVP) under Anzatz (12) formally becomes L\u22172\u03c41 = \u22121 with \u03c41(1) = 0 and \u2202r\u03c41(0) = 0,\nfor L\u22172(r) := ( 1\u2212 r \u03be\n2\n) r\u03be+4\u03b3 2 \u2202rr. (13)\nWe refer the reader to Supplemental Material26 for details on derivations of (10)-(13) . As for now, we observe that the term (1 \u2212 r\u03be/2) is bounded and of order O(1). Hence, the separation times behave as if the multifractal random flows were Gaussian, yet with effective driving Hurst parameter\n\u03be\u03b3 := \u03be + 4\u03b3 2 > \u03be > \u03beK . (14)\nThis Gaussian flow is smoother than the flow at \u03b3 = 0 ! This calculation evidences a highly paradoxical interplay between multifractality, roughness and spontaneous stochasticity: Increasing \u03b3 makes the flow rougher in terms of the effective roughness \u03beK deduced from Kolmogorov theorem, but makes the flow smoother in terms of the spontaneous stochasticity of tracers, driven by \u03be\u03b3 given above. A practical consequence of Eq. (14) is the presence of a phase transition driven by \u03b3, and characterized by \u03be\u03b3 = 1. This prescribes the mean-field critical curve\n\u03b3c = 1\n2\n\u221a 1\u2212 \u03be : (15)\nFor 0 < \u03be < 1, tracers are spontaneously stochastic when \u03b3 < \u03b3c and deterministic when \u03b3 \u2265 \u03b3c. For \u03be = 1, the Gaussian case is deterministic, and the critical \u03b3c is vanishing, as should be. For \u03be = 0, this prescribes \u03b3c = 1/2, less than the maximum value \u221a 2/2 allowed for the GMC. The critical value \u03b3c can therefore in principle be achieved for any Hurst exponent \u03be \u2208]0, 1],\n4 \u03be \u03b3 N \u03b7 dt Tmax Realizations 2/9 to 1 0 to 0.6 27 to 214 4\u03c0/N 10\u22124 8 to 64 105\nTABLE I. Numerical parameters for Fig.2 and Fig. 3 for both methods. For SDE-based numerics, realizations are independent while for the field-based numerics, we use minibatches of 100 trajectories to reach 105 samples.\nNumerics. To illustrate the rationale of the prediction (14) and mean-field Ansatz (12), we now report results of Monte-Carlo sampling of pair trajectories, obtained from two different methods, and where we vary the levels of roughness \u03be, intermittency \u03b3 and the regularization scale \u03b7. The first method is field-based. It uses direct integration of the dynamics (4) with standard Euler-Maruyama method, and requires to generate a new spatial realization of the field (5) at each timestep. Tracers are then advected by smoothly interpolating the velocity field at their current positions. The second method is SDE-based. It uses the representation (9) in terms of interacting particles and only requires to generate a single field, namely the frozen GMC, per a pair of trajectories. In the SDE setting, in order to enhance numerical stability, we add a callback function ensuring exact reflecting boundary conditions for particles reaching \u03b7. Beyond the physical parameters \u03be, \u03b3, \u03b7, both methods require to set values for the field resolutions N , the number of trajectory realizations, the timesteps dt \u2013 Table I lists the essential numerical parameters. To ensure a finite-time completion of the numerical algorithms, we use a maximal time Tmax over which the numerics are stopped: Our Monte-Carlo sampling therefore does not measure \u03c41(\u03b7) but rather the estimate \u03c4\u03031 = \u2329 TY1 \u2227 Tmax \u232a .\nFig. 2 and Fig. 3 summarize our numerical observations, and those prove compatible with the mean-field predictions. As seen from Fig. 2, we monitor two types of behaviors when prescribing 0 < \u03be < 1. Setting for instance \u03be = 2/3 as in Panels (a,b), we observe that for small \u03b3, the estimates \u03c4\u03031 converge to finite value, independent from Tmax. Upon decreasing \u03b7, it is found that this value is compatible with the mean-field prediction \u03c4mf1 (\u03be\u03b3) = (2(1\u2212 \u03be\u03b3)(1\u2212 \u03be\u03b3/2))\u22121 involving the Kraichnan flow estimate with the driving Hurst exponent as input26. This evidences the spontaneous stochastic nature of separations for small \u03b3. For large \u03b3, the apparent convergence of \u03c4\u03031 when decreasing \u03b7 is a numerical artifact, as the limiting value grows with Tmax. This signals deterministic behavior, with the particles not separating in the limit \u03b7 \u2192 0. As such, for all the values of \u03be considered in this work, our numerics reflect the presence of a phase transition at finite value of \u03b3. This is in agreement with our mean-field argument, and substantiates our claim that intermittency here favors deterministic behavior. The onset of deterministic behav-\n(a) (b)\n(c) (d)\nFIG. 2.

(d) Colormap for the average separation time \u03c41 against the roughness and intermittency parameters \u03be, \u03b3 from SDE-based numerics.

Red (blue) rendering indicate values close to 0 (1) suggestive of spontaneously stochastic (deterministic) behavior.\nior when increasing \u03b3 is found to be similar when using either field-based or SDE-based numerics. Focusing on the cases \u03be = 1/3 and \u03be = 2/3, we find good compatibility with the mean-field prediction in the latter case and observe deviations in the former case \u2013 see Panel (c). As seen from Panel (d), the mean-field prediction accurately captures the transition between deterministic and nondeterministic behaviors for small values of the effective roughness, corresponding to the larger values of \u03be. The agreement seems to deteriorate for smaller \u03be. This discrepancy suggests that the mean-field approach becomes inaccurate in the latter regime, but one cannot rule out a defect of the numerics : As \u03be \u2192 0+, the paths become very rough, and the Euler-Maruyama scheme may become unfit even when combined with very fine timestepping.\nFig. 3 shows the effect of non-Gaussianity playing out at fixed value of the driving Hurst exponent \u03be\u03b3 = 2/3 in the spontaneous stochastic regime. As seen from Panels (a) and (b), the behaviors between Gaussian and non-Gaussian settings are qualitatively different, although by construction, both share the same mean-field average separation time. In the Gaussian case, the GMC \u221d e\u03b3Y is unity, and the behavior of pairs is statistically independent from their absolute positions. In the non-\n5 (a) (b)\n(c) (d)\nFIG. 3.

This is compatible with the fact that Eq. (10) ruling the pair separations is not closed, unless one further averages over the GMC realizations. This behavior reflects in the PDF of exit-times. At large times, the Gaussian setting exhibits the exponential decay \u221d e\u2212t/\u03c41 predicted by the Kraichnan flow theory26. The non-Gaussian case deviates from the exponential behavior; it exhibits fat tails, likely reflecting particles trapped in quiet \u201cvalleys\u201d of the frozen-in-time GMC. Understanding the details of this slow decay requires tools more refined than the present mean-field approach and is left for future studies.\nConcluding remarks. We have proposed a non-trivial extension of the Kraichnan flow theory towards a multifractal setting, that we obtained by decorating the original Markovian Gaussian flows with a frozen-in-time Gaussian multiplicative chaos. Multifractality makes the flow rougher in terms of the Kolmogorov roughness \u03beK , but the spontaneous stochasticity of two-particle separation maps to that of a smoother Gaussian environment, with Hurst exponent \u03be\u03b3 > \u03be > \u03beK . This paradoxical effect is all the less intuitive, as the second-order structure functions of our parametric family of fields are characterized by constant \u03b6(2) = \u03be independent of the level of the intermittency. This is an example of a \u201csmoother ride over a rougher sea\u201d at play in scalar\ntransport21,39, and possibly connected to the mathematical theory of regularization by noise40. The availability of a SDE-based interpretation suggests a new playground to build a fundamental understanding of transport in multifractal environments. This includes tackling higherdimensions, revisiting scalar intermittency and connections with anomalous dissipation41,42, or more generally addressing irreversibility43,44 and universality of transport. On the latter aspect, let us here point out that the specific value of the driving roughness \u03be\u03b3 is clearly model-dependent. For example, using white-in-time versions of the GMC (not shown here), both the mean-field approach and the numerics yield \u03be\u03b3 = \u03be. The dependence upon time-correlation is reminiscent of that observed in the Gaussian case20. However, one could expect that the feature \u03be\u03b3 \u2265 \u03b6(2) is a robust feature of pair-dispersion in multifractal environments, and this could prove crucial in assessing transport in genuine turbulent environments. Roughness and intermittency levels measured in 3D homogeneous isotropic turbulence corresponds to \u03be \u2243 0.69 and \u03b3 \u2243 0.1532,45,46. In our model, this choice of parameters results in driving Hurst parameter \u03be\u03b3 \u2243 0.77. Transposing this exponent to a deterministic setting would yield Richardson diffusion R \u223c t1.62, noticeably different from t3/2. Naturally, while they extend the Kraichnan flows to a more realistic setting, our unidimensional multifractal environments remain caricatures of genuine turbulent fields, and lack essential ingredients such as skewness, temporal correlations, incompressiblity, etc. At a more mathematical level, our analysis suggests that the problem of transport in multifractal random flows, be them Eq. (5) or variations thereof, might prove solvable. Here, the use of a frozen-in-time GMC as a random environment is strongly reminiscent of the parabolic Anderson model used in condensed matter physics47 and the Liouville Brownian motion entering the construction of field theories in the context of 2D quantum gravity37,38. Exploiting those analogies may provide a path towards a rigorous treatment of transport in multifractal turbulentlike random environments, and quantitative modeling of turbulent transport in terms of random fields."

Kraichnan flows correspond to the case of a vanishing intermittency parameter \u03b3 = 0, hence prescribing the velocity field as Gaussian random flow.

(4), as it is the correlation function that controls the spontaneously stochastic nature of Gaussian Kraichnan flows.\nOur 2\u03c0-periodic version of the field (30) is then\nu\u03be,\u03b3\u03b7 (x, dt) := \u2211\n|k|<4\u03c0/\u03b7 eikxL(\u03be)(k)M (\u03b3)\u03b7 (k, dt),\nwith L(\u03be)(k) := \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 2\n\u03c0\n\u222b 1\n0\ndr C\u03be(r) cos(kr) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 1/2 ,\n(31)\nfeaturing the Fourier representation of the GMC kernel\nM (\u03b3)\u03b7 (k, dt) := 1\n2\u03c0Z\u03b7\n\u222b \u03c0\n\u2212\u03c0 e\u2212ikxe\u03b3Y W1(dx, dt),\nZ := e\u03b3 2E(Y 2).\n(32)\nThe latter formula involves the two random processes\nW1(x, dt) := \u2211\n|k|<4\u03c0/\u03b7 eikxW\u0302 (1) k (dt),\nand Y := \u2211\n|k|<4\u03c0/\u03b7 eikxL(0)(k)W\u0302 (2) k (dt)\n(33)\nfeaturing two mutually independent complex white noises W\u0302\n(1,2) k (dt). Specifically, each W\u0302 (i) k (t) are complex centered Gaussian processes, mutually independent except for the Hermitian symmetry W\u0302 (i)\u2212k(t) = W\u0302 (i),\u2217 k (t). They have the explicit correlation\nE ( W\u0302\n(i) k (t)W\u0302 (j) \u2212k (t) ) = \u03b4ij\u03b4kk\u2032 min(t, t \u2032). (34)\nThe normalizing factor is then simply estimated as\nZ(\u03b7) = \u2211\n|k|<4\u03c0/\u03b7 |L(0)(k)|2 = O(\u03b7\u2212\u03b32). (35)\nAll the numerics were performed using the Julia language14.
