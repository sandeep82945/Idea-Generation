    "abstractText": "Micro-expression is a fleeting facial expression of emotion that usually occurs in high-stake situations and reveals the true emotion that a person tries to conceal. Due to its unique nature, recognizing micro-expression has great applications for fields like law enforcement, medical treatment, and national security. However, the psychological mechanism of micro-expression recognition is still poorly understood. In the present research, we sought to expand upon previous research to investigate whether the group membership of the expresser influences the recognition process of micro-expressions. By conducting two behavioral studies, we found that contrary to the widespread ingroup advantage found in macro-expression recognition, there was a robust ingroup disadvantage in micro-expression recognition instead. Specifically, in Study 1A and 1B, we found that participants were more accurate at recognizing the intense and subtle micro-expressions of their racial outgroups than those micro-expressions of their racial ingroups, and neither the training experience nor the duration of micro-expressions moderated this ingroup disadvantage. In Study 2A and 2B, we further found that mere social categorization alone was sufficient to elicit the ingroup disadvantage for the recognition of intense and subtle micro-expressions, and such an effect was also unaffected by the duration of micro-expressions. These results suggest that individuals spontaneously employ the social category information of others to recognize micro-expressions, and the ingroup disadvantage in micro-expression stems partly from motivated differential processing of ingroup micro-expressions.",

Micro-expression is an extremely quick facial expression of emotion that lasts less than 0.5 s (Matsumoto and Hwang, 2011, 2018; Yan et\u00a0al., 2013). This kind of expression is more likely to leak under high-stakes situations, especially when someone is trying to hide or disguise something important (e.g., the attack intention; Ekman, 2009). Due to its unique nature, recognizing micro-expression has great applications in fields like law enforcement, medical treatment, education, and national security (e.g., Russell et\u00a0al., 2008; Weinberger, 2010; Matsumoto and Hwang, 2011, 2018; Stewart and Svetieva, 2021). Prior studies have suggested that the micro-expression recognition process is influenced by factors like profession, personality, and social or emotional context (e.g., Matsumoto et\u00a0al., 2000; Frank et\u00a0al., 2009; Hurley et\u00a0al., 2014; Svetieva and Frank, 2016; Demetrioff et\u00a0al., 2017; Felisberti, 2018; Zhang et\u00a0al., 2020). In the present research, we\u00a0 sought to expand upon previous research to investigate whether the recognition of micro-expressions is influenced by the group membership of the expresser.\nGroup membership, particularly the distinction between \u201cus\u201d (ingroup) and \u201cthem\u201d (outgroup), is fundamentally important for human interactions (Hewstone et\u00a0al., 2002). Across a variety of scenarios, people tend to show a systematic tendency to favor the member of their ingroup over the member of outgroup (i.e., ingroup favoritism) based on real-world salient groupings like race, ethnicity, religiosity, and political affiliation (e.g., Hewstone et\u00a0al., 2002; Fu et\u00a0al., 2012). Such a favoritism toward ingroup members has also been demonstrated in the laboratory by using trivial groupings (i.e., the minimal group paradigm; e.g., Tajfel et\u00a0al., 1971; Makhanova et\u00a0al., 2022). More importantly, researchers have found that the group membership has also influenced our emotion communications (Elfenbein and Ambady, 2002; Elfenbein et\u00a0al., 2007). Specifically, researchers found that people are more accurate at recognizing macro-expressions (i.e., the typically expressed facial expressions that last for 0.5\u20134 s when emotions occur; Matsumoto and Hwang, 2011, 2018) of individuals belonging to their ingroup (e.g., sharing the same culture, race, ethnic group, religion, or fan membership) compared to macro-expressions displayed by people from outgroup (Elfenbein and Ambady, 2002; Elfenbein et\u00a0al., 2007; Tuminello and Davidson, 2011; Huang and Han, 2014; Zhang et\u00a0al., 2015; Friesen et\u00a0al., 2019; Kommattam et\u00a0al., 2019; Handley et\u00a0al., 2021; Fang et\u00a0al., 2022; Hess et\u00a0al., 2022). This ingroup advantage can be\u00a0partially explained by the dialect theory, which proposed that there are subtle differences in the expressions displayed by members of different groups (Elfenbein et\u00a0al., 2007). However, some researchers also found that mere social categorization alone (i.e., the minimal group) was sufficient to elicit the ingroup advantage in macro-expression recognition (e.g., Thibault et\u00a0al., 2006; Young and Hugenberg, 2010; Young and Wilson, 2018). These researches suggest that we\u00a0are motivated to decode or attend to the facial expressions of ingroup members in different ways (Elfenbein, 2015; Hess et\u00a0al., 2022), and this ingroup advantage\nmay already exist in the early processing stage of facial expression recognitions (Gamond et\u00a0al., 2017).\nCan the group membership also affect the recognition of micro-expressions? As far as we\u00a0know, no previous studies have directly addressed this issue. Answers to this question will deepen our understanding of the micro-expression recognition process which provides the necessary knowledge for developing more efficient micro-expression recognition training programs (Matsumoto and Hwang, 2011; Hurley et\u00a0 al., 2014; D\u00f6llinger et\u00a0 al., 2021) or building more valid micro-expression databases (Yan et\u00a0al., 2014; Yap et\u00a0al., 2020; Li et\u00a0al., 2022). In fact, previous studies have found that microexpressions and macro-expressions are usually identical in their appearances (Ekman, 2003; Matsumoto and Hwang, 2011, 2018; Yan et\u00a0al., 2013) and there are some similarities between the recognition of micro-expressions and the recognition of macro-expressions. For example, researchers have found that both the recognitions of micro-expression and macro-expression are affected by factors like age, personality, profession, training experience, mental disorders of perceivers, and the emotional context of facial expressions (Matsumoto et\u00a0 al., 2000; Frank et\u00a0 al., 2009; Hurley, 2012; Hurley et\u00a0 al., 2014; Svetieva and Frank, 2016; Demetrioff et\u00a0al., 2017; Zhu et\u00a0al., 2017; Zhang et\u00a0al., 2020; D\u00f6llinger et\u00a0al., 2021; Fan et\u00a0al., 2022). However, previous studies also suggest that there might be\u00a0fundamental differences in the neuropsychological basis for micro-expression recognition and macro-expression recognition. For example, although the facial mimicry has been demonstrated to be\u00a0an effective cue in macro-expression recognition, enhancing facial mimicry that occurred during emotion perception process has been demonstrated to impair the recognition accuracy of micro-expressions (Wu et\u00a0 al., 2016a; Zeng et\u00a0al., 2018). Researchers also found that the EEG/ ERPs mechanisms are different for the recognition of microexpressions and the recognition of macro-expressions, and these differences are mainly located in the inferior temporal gyrus and front lobe (Shen et\u00a0al., 2016). More importantly, one recent study showed that while the ancient neuropeptide oxytocin has been demonstrated to have a facilitating role in the recognition of macro-expressions, intranasal oxytocin administration was found to disrupt the recognition of microexpressions (Wu et\u00a0 al., 2022). Given that researchers also found that the expressions of ingroup members are more likely to elicit facial mimicry from perceivers (e.g., Hess and Fischer, 2014; Hess et\u00a0 al., 2022) and the neuropeptide oxytocin are more likely to affect the social tendency toward ingroup members (e.g., De Dreu et\u00a0al., 2011; McClung et\u00a0al., 2018), these previous studies suggest that the facial mimicry generated during emotion perception and the endogenous oxytocin generated in our brain are more likely to disrupt the recognition of ingroup micro-expressions, which may further create an ingroup disadvantage in micro-expression recognition. Therefore, in the present study, we\u00a0hypothesized that the group membership of the expresser would also affect\nFrontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org\nthe recognition of micro-expressions and there would be\u00a0an ingroup disadvantage for micro-expression recognitions (i.e., the overall recognition accuracy of the micro-expressions of ingroup members would be\u00a0lower than the overall recognition accuracy of the micro-expressions of outgroup members).\nTo test this hypothesis, we\u00a0conducted two behavioral studies in the current research. Specifically, we\u00a0first investigated whether there is an ingroup disadvantage for micro-expression recognition in real-world social groups (i.e., race) in Study 1A1 and 1B. In Study 2A and 2B, we\u00a0further investigated whether mere social categorization alone (i.e., the minimal group) is sufficient to elicit the ingroup disadvantage in micro-expression recognition. Furthermore, prior researches showed that the accuracy of microexpression recognition may be\u00a0affected by the duration of microexpression (Shen et\u00a0al., 2012; Wu et\u00a0al., 2016a, 2022; Zeng et\u00a0al., 2018). Therefore, following previous studies (Felisberti, 2018; Zeng et\u00a0al., 2018; Wu et\u00a0al., 2022), we\u00a0employed two different settings of duration (i.e., 100 ms and 333 ms) in the present research.\nStudy 1\nAs one of the salient cues for real-world groupings, information about one\u2019s race has been shown to greatly affect the recognition of macro-expressions (e.g., Elfenbein and Ambady, 2002; Elfenbein et\u00a0al., 2007; Elfenbein, 2015; Zhang et\u00a0al., 2015; Friesen et\u00a0 al., 2019; Fang et\u00a0 al., 2022). Therefore, in Study 1, we\u00a0tested our hypothesis by employing real-world racial groups at first (i.e., White vs. Asian). Specifically, given that the intensity of the facial actions of micro-expressions may affect the recognition accuracy of micro-expressions (Wu et\u00a0al., 2016a, 2022; Zeng et\u00a0al., 2018), in Study 1A, we\u00a0investigated whether there is an ingroup disadvantage for micro-expression recognition under racial group situations by employing micro-expressions that are high in intensity (intense micro-expressions; Wu et\u00a0al., 2016a, 2022; Zeng et\u00a0al., 2018). In Study 1B, we\u00a0 further tested our hypothesis by employing micro-expressions that have low intensities (subtle micro-expressions; Wu et\u00a0al., 2016a, 2022; Zeng et\u00a0al., 2018) under race-based grouping situations. Considering that previous studies have also suggested that the recognition accuracy of microexpressions can be\u00a0 significantly improved after receiving the training of Micro Expression Training Tool (METT; Russell et\u00a0al., 2008; Ekman, 2009; Frank et\u00a0al., 2009; Matsumoto and Hwang, 2011; Hurley, 2012; Hurley et\u00a0 al., 2014), in Study 1A and 1B we\u00a0 also explored whether trainings in micro-expression recognition can moderate the ingroup disadvantage effect in micro-expression recognition.\n1 Study 1A has been presented at the conference of FG019 as an oral\npresentation (Xie et\u00a0al., 2019).\nStudy 1A"

This database contains facial expression images from 100 models (aged 18\u201370 years) of a variety of races, including White, Black, Asian, etc. For each model, one facial image of his/her neutral expression and facial images of his/her six universal facial expressions (i.e., happiness, disgust, fear, angry, surprise, and sadness) are included in the database, and each of the six universal facial expressions includes four levels of intensity (i.e., low, middle, high, and very high).\nAs for these 47 selected models from BU-3DFE database, facial images of their neutral expressions and the six universal facial expressions that were rated to be\u00a0\u201cvery high\u201d in intensity were employed. In addition, the neutral face and the six universal facial expressions of one additional Asian model from NimStim database (Tottenham et\u00a0al., 2009) were also employed (only in the pilot study, not in the formal study). All employed facial images were then rescaled to a unified size (512 \u00d7 512 pixels) and were normalized by converting them to 8-bit grey scale images and normalizing their grey values to grand mean (Liu and Chen, 2012).\nTo select the appropriate White and Asian models for the formal study and to match the recognition accuracy of macroexpressions for these models, a pilot study was carried out. In the pilot study, 30 Chinese college students were asked to recognize these normalized facial expressions (excluding the neutral faces) of the 48 selected models (i.e., 47 models from the BU-3DFE database and one Asian model from the NimStim database). These expressions were presented as macro-expressions. Specifically, the facial expressions were displayed on the screen for 1 s, then participants were asked to recognize the presented facial expressions at self-paced speed (stimuli remained on the screen until the response was made) and as accurate as possible.\nBased on the accuracy data of pilot study, 24 models (half Whites and half Asians) from the BU-3DFE database were selected. These selected 24 models were further divided into four different model groups. Specifically, the models from each\nFrontiers in Psychology 04 frontiersin.org\nrace were further divided into two model groups (i.e., W1 and W2 for White models, A1 and A2 for Asian models). Therefore, there were six models in each group, and half of the models were females, while the other half were males. Then, the normalized facial images of W1 were merged with the normalized facial images of A1 to form the stimuli set A, and the normalized facial images of W2 were merged with the normalized facial images of A2 to form the stimuli set B. A 2 (race: White, Asian) \u00d7 2 (stimuli set: A, B) repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the accuracy data of these 24 selected models showed that there were no significant differences in recognition accuracy among the macroexpressions of White models and the macro-expressions of Asian models from different stimuli sets (all the main effects and the race \u00d7 stimuli set interaction were not significant, Fs < 0.12, ps > 0.73). Therefore, the stimuli set A and the stimuli set B were employed as the facial stimuli for micro-expression recognition tasks in Study 1A. In sum, 144 images of facial expressions and 24 images of neutral faces were employed."

Taken together, the results of Study 1A and 1B suggest that there might be\u00a0 an ingroup\ndisadvantage for micro-expression recognition under the situation of salient real-world groupings.\nStudy 2\nIn Study 1, we\u00a0mainly investigated the intergroup bias in microexpression recognition by employing real-world racial groups. However, employing this type of group membership manipulation alone is not sufficient enough for researchers to completely ensure that the ingroup disadvantage found in Study 1 was not caused by some specific properties of different racial groups (e.g., the differential difficulties in recognizing micro-expressions of different racial groups). In studies of the macro-expressions, researchers have found that the recognition of macro-expression is a social categorization-based process that mere social categorization alone (i.e., using the minimal group paradigm) is sufficient to induce the ingroup advantage effect in macro-expression recognitions (Thibault et\u00a0al., 2006; Young and Hugenberg, 2010; Young and Wilson, 2018). Therefore, if the ingroup disadvantage found in Study 1 was really caused by the effects of expressers\u2019 group membership, we\u00a0should also be\u00a0able find the ingroup disadvantage for micro-expression recognition under the minimal group situations.\nIn Study 2, we\u00a0further investigated that whether the nominal ingroup-outgroup distinction alone is sufficient to elicit the ingroup disadvantage in micro-expression recognition by using the minimal group paradigm. More specifically, in Study 2, participants were randomly assigned to an arbitrary group based on an ostensible personality assessment, which creates the minimal group distinction (i.e., only the label of social group is different) between the nominal ingroup members and outgroup members (e.g., Young and Hugenberg, 2010; Wu et\u00a0 al., 2015, 2016a, 2019; Young and Wilson, 2018; Makhanova et\u00a0al., 2022).

The ostensible personality assessment was identical to Wu et\u00a0al. (2015). The computer ostensibly assessed participants\u2019 personality traits and then participants were informed that their scores from the personality assessment were characteristic of either a red or green personality (randomly assigned). They were further informed that each personality type has its own unique features and this experiment was specifically designed to examine how personality influences social perception. After that, participants were asked to wear a colored wristband indicative of their personality type. They were told that this wristband was employed to identify their particular personality type and were instructed to wear this wristband for the rest of experiment.\nTo generate the facial stimuli for Study 2A, 12 models (half males and half females; five Whites, three Asians, and four Blacks) from the BU-3DFE database were randomly selected. As for these 12 selected models, facial images of their neutral expressions and the six universal facial expressions that were rated to be\u00a0\u201cvery high\u201d in intensity were selected. Then these selected facial images were sized to 512 \u00d7 512 pixels and the background colors of these images were changed to red and green (i.e., two reprocessed images were produced for each selected facial image, one with red background, and one with green background). Finally, a total of 168 reprocessed facial images were generated and were employed as the facial stimuli for Study 2A.\nIn Study 2A, we\u00a0also employed the JACBART paradigm to present micro-expressions.

Participants were informed before the micro-expression recognition task that the background color of the stimuli indicates the personality type of the target, and a personality tag would also appear on top of facial images to indicate the target\u2019s personality (see Figure\u00a04). The task of participants was to identify the facial expression just displayed as accurate as possible (by choosing one out of seven options as in Study 1A). In microexpression recognition task of Study 2A, the 12 selected models were randomly divided into four different model groups (i.e., three models in each group, and there were at least one female model and one male model in each group). A random assignment was made between the four different presentation conditions (i.e., ingroup100 ms, ingroup-333 ms, outgroup-100 ms, outgroup-333 ms) and the four model groups, and the six universal micro-expressions of the models were presented according to their assigned presentation conditions. The combination of the model groups and the presentation conditions was counterbalanced across participants. For each model, each micro-expression was presented only once, and the stimulus presentation was completely randomized. The colored backgrounds of facial stimuli and the personality labels displayed on the top of the facial stimuli served as the ingroupoutgroup manipulation of the targets. Therefore, half of the models were presented as having the same personality type as the participants, and the other half of models were presented as having a different personality type (see Figure\u00a04).

Consistent with Study 2A, the results showed that there was a significant main effect of target group, participants still displayed higher recognition accuracy for micro-expressions of outgroup members (M = 0.39, SD = 0.08) than the micro-expressions of ingroup members (M = 0.32, SD = 0.08) under the situation of minimal groups, F(1,82) = 48.12, p < 0.001, \u03b7p2 = 0.37 (see Figure\u00a06). Consistent with Study 1A, this ingroup disadvantage under minimal group context was not moderated by the duration of microexpressions [F(1,82) = 0.33, p = 0.57, \u03b7p2 = 0.004] and the assigned personality type of participants [F(1,82) = 0.72, p = 0.40, \u03b7p2 = 0.01].

            "text": "Previous findings on macro-expressions revealed a widespread ingroup advantage in emotion perception, as individuals tend to be\u00a0 more accurate when recognizing the macro-expressions produced by members of their ingroup rather than those produced by the outgroup members (Elfenbein and Ambady, 2002; Thibault et\u00a0al., 2006; Elfenbein et\u00a0al., 2007; Young and Hugenberg, 2010; Huang and Han, 2014; Tuminello and Davidson, 2011; Zhang et\u00a0al., 2015; Gamond et\u00a0al., 2017; Young and Wilson, 2018; Friesen et\u00a0al., 2019; Kommattam et\u00a0al., 2019; Handley et\u00a0al., 2021; Fang et\u00a0al., 2022; Hess et\u00a0 al., 2022). Contrary to the researches on macroexpression recognition, the present study is the first to demonstrate that there is no ingroup advantage but an ingroup disadvantage for micro-expression recognitions. Specifically, in Study 1A and 1B, we\u00a0found that participants were more accurate at recognizing the intense and subtle micro-expressions of their racial outgroups, and such an ingroup disadvantage was not moderated by the duration\nof micro-expressions and the training experience of participants. In Study 2A and 2B, we\u00a0further found that mere social categorization alone was sufficient to elicit the ingroup disadvantage for the recognition of intense and subtle micro-expressions, and such an effect was also unaffected by the duration of micro-expressions. Moreover, the results indicate that the ingroup disadvantages in micro-expression recognition cannot be\u00a0explained by differences in skin colors or textures between expressers of different social groups, since these differences were already controlled by the procedures of image normalization (in Study 1A and 1B) or by the randomization and counterbalance of stimulus (in Study 2A and 2B). The results also showed that the ingroup disadvantage was not caused by the differential difficulties in the recognition of macro-and microexpressions of different social groups since this factor was already controlled by matching the recognition accuracy of the macroexpressions of different social groups (in Study 1A and 1B) or by taking randomization and counterbalance measures (in Study 2A and 2B). Therefore, these results are consistent with our hypothesis which suggest that there might be\u00a0a robust ingroup disadvantage in the recognition of micro-expressions and there are fundamental differences in the psychological mechanisms for the recognition of micro-expressions and macro-expressions. The results further suggest that we\u00a0may need to control the intergroup bias when we\u00a0are building micro-expression databases (e.g., the coders of database should be\u00a0recruited from diverse social backgrounds to avoid the potential coding bias; Yan et\u00a0al., 2014; Yap et\u00a0al., 2020; Li et\u00a0al., 2022).\nWhy is there an ingroup disadvantage for micro-expression recognition? Previous studies on macro-expression recognition suggest that the ingroup advantage in emotion perception stems from a multitude of coacting factors, including both greater familiarity with ingroup expressive norms and dialects and greater motivation to attend to and process ingroup emotional signals (Thibault et\u00a0al., 2006; Elfenbein et\u00a0al., 2007; Young and Hugenberg, 2010; Elfenbein, 2015; Young and Wilson, 2018; Hess et\u00a0al., 2022). In the present research, we\u00a0found clear evidence that mere ingroupoutgroup distinctions alone can reliably elicit ingroup disadvantage in micro-expression recognition, which suggests that the intergroup\nFIGURE\u00a06 Mean recognition accuracies of micro-expressions of ingroup and outgroup members in Study 2B. Error bars represent standard errors.\nFrontiers in Psychology 11 frontiersin.org\nbias in micro-expression recognition is a social-categorization based process and it is caused by the motivated differential processing of micro-expressions of ingroup members. In fact, previous studies have suggested that such differential processing of ingroup micro-expressions may stem from the differential effects of endogenous oxytocin and facial mimicry on ingroup members. That is, the endogenous neuropeptide of oxytocin and the facial mimicry generated during emotion perception are more likely to disrupt the recognition of micro-expressions of ingroup members (De Dreu et\u00a0al., 2011; Stallen et\u00a0al., 2012; Hess and Fischer, 2014; Wu et\u00a0al., 2016a, 2022; McClung et\u00a0al., 2018; Zeng et\u00a0al., 2018; Hess et\u00a0al., 2022). Given the close association between oxytocin and facial mimicry (i.e., oxytocin may facilitate the production of facial mimicry; Korb et\u00a0 al., 2016; Pavarini et\u00a0 al., 2019), the previous studies also suggest that the oxytocin system may be\u00a0 the neurophysiological basis for the ingroup disadvantage effect in micro-expression recognitions. However, we\u00a0should note that the results of the present study cannot rule out the possibility that the nonverbal dialects have also affected the recognition of microexpressions since we\u00a0 had also found the ingroup disadvantage under racial group situations (in Study 1A and 1B) in which the nonverbal dialect differences were not controlled. Researchers need to recruit participants from more diverse culture backgrounds (e.g., White participants) and employ instructed emotional faces (e.g., Tsikandilakis et\u00a0al., 2021) to explore this issue in the future.\nContrary to the universal tendency of ingroup favoritism found across cultures (e.g., Tajfel et\u00a0al., 1971; Hewstone et\u00a0al., 2002; Ji et\u00a0 al., 2019; Makhanova et\u00a0 al., 2022), a counterintuitive phenomenon of ingroup derogation (i.e., the tendency to favor members of one\u2019s outgroup over members of one\u2019s ingroup) has also been reported (mainly in the East Asian cultures; Ma-Kellams et\u00a0al., 2011; Zhao et\u00a0al., 2012; Wu et\u00a0al., 2015, 2016b, 2019). For example, it was reported that the Chinese participants tended to associate Westerners with more positive characteristics than members of their own ethnic group (Ma-Kellams et\u00a0al., 2011). Moreover, it was found that Chinese participants also rated outgroup members\u2019 faces and names as more beautiful and better (Zhao et\u00a0al., 2012; Wu et\u00a0al., 2016b), and they also displayed more cooperation tendency toward the members of outgroup under minimal group situations (Wu et\u00a0al., 2015, 2016b, 2019). Given that in the present research we\u00a0also exclusively focused on Chinese participants, these previous studies suggest that the ingroup disadvantage found in the present research can be\u00a0viewed as a manifestation of ingroup derogation at the perceptual level. In fact, previous studies on macro-expressions have also reported that the ingroup advantage effect tend to be\u00a0 unstable for Chinese participants (e.g., Beaupr\u00e9 and Hess, 2006; Mondillon et\u00a0al., 2007; Prado et\u00a0al., 2014; Zhang et\u00a0al., 2015). However, it should be\u00a0noted that the adaptation account of ingroup favoritism (Navarrete and Fessler, 2006; Van Vugt and Park, 2009; Fu et\u00a0al., 2012) may also offer the explanation for the ingroup disadvantage phenomenon found in the present study. That is, individuals harbor ingroup favoritism attitudes because it is the ingroup members who offer us the important chances of cooperation and the necessary protections\nagainst intergroup violence and disease threats (Navarrete and Fessler, 2006; Van Vugt and Park, 2009; Fu et\u00a0al., 2012). Therefore, given the close association between the production of microexpressions and deception or hiding of emotions (Ekman, 2003, 2009; Matsumoto and Hwang, 2011, 2018; Yan et\u00a0al., 2013), having an ingroup disadvantage in micro-expression perception may still be\u00a0 adaptive for individuals since moderately inhibiting the processing of information associated with one\u2019s untrustworthiness may facilitate the valuable ingroup cohesions that are important for one\u2019s survival (Pfundmair et\u00a0al., 2017; Wu et\u00a0al., 2022). Nonetheless, the current evidence obtained in the present research is not sufficient for us to discriminate between these two possibilities (i.e., the culture-specific ingroup derogation account and the universal adaptive ingroup favoritism account). Cross-cultural researches, such as conducting researches in Western cultures, are needed to investigate the universality of ingroup disadvantage in microexpression recognition in the future.\nWill the effects of expressers\u2019 group membership be\u00a0consistent for the recognition of micro-expressions from different emotion categories? Given the main purpose of the current research was to investigate the effects of group membership on the overall microexpression recognition performance, in the present study, we\u00a0had only employed three trials for each category of micro-expressions under each condition. Such an experimental design would greatly undermine the statistical power for the analysis of the interaction of expressers\u2019 group membership and emotion category (Wu et\u00a0al., 2016a; Zeng et\u00a0al., 2018). Therefore, we\u00a0simply dropped the factor of emotion category in our analysis. Previous studies employing similar trial numbers in micro-expression recognition also did not include this factor into consideration or simply found the nonsignificant interactions (Wu et\u00a0al., 2016a; Zeng et\u00a0al., 2018). However, it should be\u00a0noted that one recent study employing more trials (12 trials) for each category of micro-expression did find the significant interaction between the intended experimental manipulation (administration of oxytocin) and the emotion category (Wu et\u00a0al., 2022). In addition, it also should be\u00a0note that employing too less trials for a specific category of microexpressions prevents the researchers from analyzing the recognition error patterns of ingroup and outgroup micro-expressions by using confusion matrix (Shen et\u00a0al., 2012). Researchers need to employ more emotion-specific experimental design (e.g., focusing on two or three representative kinds of micro-expressions; e.g., Zhang et\u00a0al., 2020) and more trials (e.g., Shen et\u00a0al., 2012) to solve these issues in the future.\nIn the present research, the JACBART paradigm was employed to present micro-expressions. As a well-accepted method to present micro-expressions in the laboratory (e.g., Hurley, 2012; Wu et\u00a0 al., 2016a, 2022; Demetrioff et\u00a0 al., 2017; Zhang et\u00a0al., 2020; D\u00f6llinger et\u00a0al., 2021; Fan et\u00a0al., 2022), this paradigm enables effectively manipulation of the core features of micro-expression (e.g., the intensity or duration of microexpressions) without incurring interference (e.g., the head movement of models). However, it should be\u00a0noted that besides its advantage in internal validity, JACBART paradigm does have\nFrontiers in Psychology 12 frontiersin.org\nsome limitations in its ecological validity: It only utilizes three still images to synthesize the facial dynamics of micro-expressions (Matsumoto et\u00a0al., 2000), which is significantly different from the natural micro-expression in realistic settings (Yan et\u00a0al., 2013; Li et\u00a0 al., 2022; Wu et\u00a0al., 2022). Although the previous research suggests that the recognition of JACBART synthesized microexpressions is very similar to the recognition of natural microexpressions (Wu et\u00a0al., 2022), researchers in the future still need to address this ecological issue by employing more naturalistic dataset (e.g., Yan et\u00a0al., 2014; Yap et\u00a0al., 2020; Li et\u00a0al., 2022). In addition, it also should be\u00a0noted that although the results of the present study suggest that the ingroup disadvantage in microexpression recognition cannot be\u00a0moderated by the duration of micro-expression or by the training experience of the perceivers, it is still possible that such results might be\u00a0caused by the specific setting of METT training or by the specific setting of durations in the present research. For example, by repetitiously investigating the effects of facial feedback under four different settings of duration in the experiment, one recent study eventually found out that enhancing facial mimicry may only affect the recognition accuracy of intense micro-expressions under long duration conditions (e.g., 450 ms; Zeng et\u00a0al., 2018). Therefore, researchers may still need employ more diverse settings of durations (e.g., Shen et\u00a0 al., 2012) and more intensive micro-expression recognition trainings (e.g., Hurley, 2012) to further test the boundary condition of ingroup disadvantage effect in the future."
