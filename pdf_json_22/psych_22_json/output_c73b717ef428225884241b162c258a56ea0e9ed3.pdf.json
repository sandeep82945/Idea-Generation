Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the association\nbetween maternal IPV and HRQOL among Chinese preschool children, as well\nas the mediating role of maternal parenting styles.\nMethods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 4,243 mother-child\ndyads who attended preschools. Mothers self-reported their parenting styles\nand experience of IPV. Children\u2019s HRQOL was collected through mother-\nproxy report with the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory version 4.0 (PedsQL\n4.0). Multivariate linear regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the\nassociation between maternal IPV and children\u2019s HRQOL. Mediation models\nwere further applied to explore the possible mediating role of maternal\nparenting styles.\nResults: Of the included mothers, 7.4% had experience of IPV. Compared\nto children of mothers without any IPV exposure, those of mothers with\nexperience of IPV had significantly lower scores in all HRQOL dimensions\nand summary scales. After adjustment for covariates, maternal IPV was\nsignificantly associated with children\u2019s lower physical health summary score,\npsychosocial health summary score, and total scale score. Mediation analysis\nshowed that both rejection and overprotection mediated such associations,\nbut not for the emotional warmth.\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 01 frontiersin.org\nConclusion: Our findings indicated the need to screen maternal\nIPV supplemented with targeted interventions focusing on parenting\nstyles, in order to mitigate the negative impact of maternal IPV on\nchildren\u2019s HRQOL.\nKEYWORDS\nintimate partner violence, health-related quality of life, parenting styles, preschool children, mediation"

            "text": "Intimate partner violence (IPV) against women is prevalent around the world. In 2018, the estimated global prevalence of physical and/or sexual IPV was 27% among women aged between 15 and 49 years (1). In regard to the situation in China, a review has summarized relevant studies and found that the lifetime prevalence ranged from 24.5 to 30.0% for psychological IPV, and from 5.4 to 34.0% for physical IPV in Chinese women (2). A recent study conducted in 6 provinces across China has even shown that the lifetime prevalence of psychological and physical IPV was as high as 77.7 and 40.2% in female adults, respectively (3). The high prevalence of IPV in China makes it a public health issue with widespread concern.\nIt is well-accepted that women who had experienced IPV were at higher risk of both mental and physical impairment, as well as premature death (4\u20137). A large body of evidence has further revealed that the detrimental impact of IPV against mothers could also extend to the next generation, leading to delayed development, poorer physical health, and more psychosocial problems in their children (8\u201310). For example, a cross-sectional study conducted in South Africa has found that children with maternal report of IPV were more likely to fall behind their peers in cognitive and language development (8). Longitudinal studies have also suggested that children of mothers with IPV exposure were at higher risk of both physical and psychological health problems, including asthma, and posttraumatic stress disorder (9, 10). In addition to above-mentioned health issues, maternal IPV could also impair children\u2019s health-related quality of life (HRQOL), a multidimensional construct that includes physical, psychological, and social wellbeing (11). A small-scale study conducted in China has shown a significant link between maternal IPV and children\u2019s poorer psychosocial HRQOL (12). Another cross-sectional study conducted in Japan has also found that children with mothers of IPV exposure tended to have poorer HRQOL (13).\nThe mechanisms of the association between maternal IPV and poorer HRQOL in offspring remain unclear. One of the possible explanations is related to parenting styles, an multifaced and complex family factor that could affect children\u2019s physical\nand psychosocial development (14). Parents rear and encourage their offspring to learn to inhibit actions that may be harmful or annoying to others, and meanwhile, to acquire behaviors that the society and culture demand, such as self-reliance, consideration for others, accepting responsibility, and skills that will help them to become competent members of the society, which is called parental socialization (15, 16). One of the seminal theories of parental socialization is the tripartite model \u201cY\u201d proposed by Baumrind (17). This model consisted of three parenting styles (i.e., authoritative, authoritarian, and permissive) based on the interaction between affection, communication, and control, yielding three modes of parental control, including the authoritative control, the authoritarian control, and the permissive control (i.e., lack of control) (17, 18). Furthermore, Maccoby and Martin have proposed a bidimensional model of warmth and strictness, which has become the referential model for studying parental socialization (15, 16). Parental warmth refers to how parents support and communicate with their children and show care and acceptance to them (19\u201321). It has been labeled with other names with similar meanings, such as acceptance/involvement, assurance, nurturance or love (16, 19, 22\u201325). In contrast, the dimension of parental strictness was defined as how parents use control and supervision to uphold their authority, moderate children\u2019s behaviors, and establish norms for them (22, 26). Domination, hostility, inflexibility, firm control, or restriction are some of the labels applied in family studies to indicate strictness dimension (16, 20, 22, 25, 27). Based on these two dimensions, four different parenting styles were identified: authoritative parents (high in both warmth and strictness), authoritarian parents (low in warmth and high in strictness), indulgent parents (high in warmth and low in strictness), and neglectful parents (low in both warmth and strictness) (15, 16). Previous studies have shown that mothers with experience of IPV were more likely to adopt parenting styles of neglect, psychological aggression, and physical aggression (28, 29). For example, a review of 136 studies has illustrated that mothers who suffered from IPV tended to engage in harsh, rejective, and overprotective parenting styles (29). Furthermore, maternal rejection has been demonstrated to be associated with poorer HRQOL in children (30). Therefore,\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 02 frontiersin.org\nparenting styles might play a role in the association between maternal IPV and children\u2019s HRQOL.\nIn spite of the aforementioned findings, few studies have explored the associations of maternal IPV, children\u2019s HRQOL, and maternal parenting styles simultaneously. Thus, the current cross-sectional study aims to (1) evaluate the association between maternal IPV and HRQOL of their children attending preschools, and (2) explore whether maternal parenting styles mediate such associations."

In the second stage, two preschools were further randomly chosen from each selected area, with 14 preschools in total. In the last stage, all children in the selected preschools and their parents were invited to join the study. From May to July 2021, caregivers of 5,102 preschool children have finished an online questionnaire (response rate: 86.5%). We have further excluded 795 children as the questionnaires were answered by their fathers, 23 children with answers from their grandparents or other caregivers and 41 children with misreport of age, leaving 4,243 mother-child dyads in the current analysis.\nEthical approval for the study was obtained from Sun Yat-sen University prior to participation (Reference number: 2021[116]), and informed consent was obtained from each parent."

            "text": "In consistent with previous studies (31, 32), maternal IPV status was assessed by two questions: (1) Have you ever been psychologically hurt by your intimate partner (e.g., scolding, belittling, humiliating, and intimidation)? (2) Have you ever been physically hurt by your intimate partner (e.g., slapping, hitting, kicking, and beating)? Answers to each of these questions were \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d A mother was considered as a victim of IPV if she has reported a positive answer (i.e., yes) to either of the question.\nChildren\u2019s HRQOL was reported by their mothers using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Version 4.0 (PedsQL 4.0), which has been validated in Chinese population (33). The questionnaire consists of 21 items for young children aged between 2 and 4 years and 23 items for those aged\nbetween 5 and 7 years. Both versions are comprised of four subscales, including physical functioning (8 items, e.g., \u201clifting something heavy\u201d), emotional functioning (5 items, e.g., \u201cfeeling sad\u201d), social functioning (5 items, e.g., \u201cgetting teased by other children\u201d), and school functioning (3 items for 2\u20134 years old children, and 5 items for 5\u20137 years old children, e.g., \u201cmissing school/daycare because of not feeling well\u201d) (34). Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale (0 = never a problem, 1 = almost never a problem, 2 = sometimes a problem, 3 = often a problem, and 4 = almost always a problem), and reversely transformed to 0\u223c100 (0 = 100, 1 = 75, 2 = 50, 3 = 25, and 4 = 0). The average score of all items in each subscale is used to assess children\u2019s HRQOL in different dimensions, with a higher score indicating better HRQOL. In addition, three summary scores were further generated, namely physical health summary score, psychosocial health summary score, and total scale score. The physical health summary score was represented by the physical functioning dimension, while the psychosocial health summary score was calculated as the average score of the emotional functioning, social functioning, and school functioning dimensions. A total scale score of the overall HRQOL was further calculated as the average score of all items in the four dimensions.\nMaternal parenting styles were measured by the short Egna Minnen Betr\u00e4ffande Uppfostran Parent Form (S-EMBU-P), a 21-item questionnaire to assess self-reported parenting styles with three dimensions, including emotional warmth (7 items, e.g., \u201cI praise my child\u201d), rejection (6 items, e.g., \u201cI get angry with my child without letting him/her know the reason\u201d), and overprotection (8 items, e.g., \u201cMy child wishes I would worry less about what he/she is doing\u201d) (35, 36). The emotional warmth dimension refers to the degree that parents praise, approve, encourage, help, and show affection to their children, while the rejection dimension and the overprotection dimension describe the degree to which parents direct, command, punish, and impose rules and restrictions to their children (37). All items are rated on a 4-point Likert scale (1 = never, 2 = seldom, 3 = often, and 4 = most of the time). The score of each parenting style was calculated by adding up the items in the corresponding dimension and a higher score indicates more emotional warmth, more rejective behaviors, and more overprotection from mothers, respectively.\nChildren\u2019s age, gender, status of single child, sleep duration, and primary caregiver were reported by their mothers. The status of single child was classified as yes (with one child in the family) or no (with more than one child in the family). Children\u2019s sleep duration was calculated as (5 \u00d7 sleep duration on weekdays + 2 \u00d7 sleep duration on weekend)/7, and was further separated into < 10 h/day and \u2265 10 h/day groups. Primary caregivers of children were categorized as mothers, fathers, and others.\nMothers self-reported their age, current marital status, educational level, and monthly per-capita income. Current marital status was separated into married and unmarried\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 03 frontiersin.org\ngroups. The latter included single, divorced, separated, and widowed. Educational level was grouped into (1) junior high school or below, (2) senior high school, (3) bachelor\u2019s degree, and (4) master\u2019s degree and above.

The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using 5000 bootstrap samples to test the significance of mediating effects.

Furthermore, children of mothers with IPV exposure had significantly lower HRQOL scores in all dimensions and summary scales, compared to those of children whose mothers had not reported IPV (Figure 1).\nThe correlation matrix between children\u2019s HRQOL and maternal parenting styles is presented in Table 2. There was a significant correlation between maternal emotional warmth and higher scores in all subscales of children\u2019s HRQOL, except physical functioning. In the contrary, maternal rejection and overprotection were negatively correlated with all subscales of children\u2019s HRQOL.\nFigure 2 shows the associations between maternal IPV and summary scores of children\u2019s HRQOL. The results showed that maternal IPV was significantly associated with lower physical\nhealth summary score (\u03b2 = \u20133.02, p < 0.05), psychosocial health summary score (\u03b2 = \u20135.31, p < 0.001), and total scale score (\u03b2 = \u20134.74, p < 0.001) after adjustment for covariates.\nFigure 3 presents the results of mediation analysis. Mothers with experience of IPV were more likely to be rejective (\u03b2 = 0.76, p < 0.001) and overprotective (\u03b2 = 0.56, p < 0.001) toward their children. They also tended to have lower scores on self-rated emotional warmth, but with borderline significance (\u03b2 = \u2013 0.45, p = 0.078). Furthermore, maternal emotional warmth was significantly associated with higher psychosocial health summary score (\u03b2 = 0.41, p < 0.001) and total scale score (\u03b2 = 0.28, p < 0.001), but not for the physical health summary score (\u03b2 = \u20130.10, p = 0.161). In contrast, both rejection and overprotection were significantly associated with lower physical health summary score, psychosocial health summary score, and total scale score.

However, the direct impact of maternal IPV on children\u2019s physical health summary score was not statistically significant anymore after adjustment for parenting styles.\nFurther mediation analyses indicated that parenting styles was a significant mediator in the association between maternal IPV and poorer HRQOL in offspring, attributable to 48.3, 27.3, and 30.6% of the total effect in the association of maternal IPV with physical health summary score, psychosocial health summary score, and total scale score, respectively. Specifically, the indirect effects of rejection and overprotection were significant in all three models. However, the mediating effect of emotional warmth was not significant in any of the models (Table 3)."

Preschool children of mothers with IPV had significantly lower scores in all dimensions and summary scales of PedsQL 4.0 measured HRQOL, compared to their counterparts whose mothers reported no experience of IPV. In addition, we found that the associations between maternal IPV and children\u2019s physical, psychosocial, and overall HRQOL were mediated by maternal parenting styles of rejection and overprotection.\nOur findings indicated that maternal IPV was significantly associated with children\u2019s adverse health outcomes, which was supported by previous studies (13, 39, 40). A cross-sectional study conducted in Japan has revealed a significant association between maternal IPV and poorer HRQOL in their preschool children (13). A cohort study conducted in Brazil has also shown that children of mothers with exposure to IPV had increased risk of behavioral and emotional difficulties, compared to those of mothers without experience of IPV (39). Furthermore, in an\ninvestigation conducted in India, maternal IPV has been found to be a risk factor for acute respiratory infection (aOR: 1.93, 95% CI: 1.42\u20132.61), diarrhea (aOR: 2.08, 95% CI: 1.74\u20132.46), and fever (aOR: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.55\u20132.14) in children aged 5 years or younger (40).\nFurthermore, we have shown that maternal emotional warmth was positively associated with children\u2019s psychosocial health, while maternal parenting styles of rejection and overprotection were negatively associated with children\u2019s physical and psychosocial health. These results were supported by recent evidence about the superiority of high parental warmth and low strictness in children\u2019s psychosocial adjustment (24, 41\u201344). For example, a cross-sectional study with participants from Spain, the United States, Germany, and Brazil, has found that indulgent parenting style (i.e., high parental warmth and low strictness) was associated with greatest personal and social wellbeing in adolescents (41). Another cross-sectional study conducted in Spain has also shown a significant link between parental warmth and better adolescent adjustment, while the opposite was the case for parental strictness and adolescent adjustment (42). However, several studies conducted in American families have identified that only the combination of parental warmth and strictness together (i.e., authoritative parenting) could promote adolescents\u2019 development and socialization (25, 45, 46). In addition, strict parenting style (i.e., authoritarian parenting) has been found to be beneficial to children\u2019s psychosocial adjustment and academic success in Chinese Americans (47), African Americans (48), and Arab societies (49). Nevertheless, a recent longitudinal study conducted in mainland China has recognized the superiority of authoritative parenting style in children\u2019s adjustment, including social competence, academic achievement, self-esteem, motherchild relationship, and behaviors (50). Such inconsistent findings indicate that the influence of parenting styles on children\u2019s psychosocial adjustment and socialization is different by society and culture (24, 51), and is depending on the age of children involved (21).\nThe current study also indicated the mediating role of parenting styles in the association between maternal IPV and children\u2019s HRQOL, which was in line with previous studies (52\u201356). For example, a cross-sectional study of preschool children has suggested harsh parenting style as a mediator in the association between maternal psychological IPV and children\u2019s disruptive behaviors (52). A longitudinal study of 905 mothers and their children has found aggressive parenting behaviors (i.e., spanking) to be a mediator in the association between maternal IPV and children\u2019s poor mental health and social relationship at the age of 5 years (53). Another prospective cohort study conducted in the United States has also indicated that maternal IPV was significantly associated with lower levels of maternal sensitive parenting, which could subsequently impair the cognitive development in their children (54). Furthermore, a study based on a cohort of 308 mother-child dyads has shown\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 06 frontiersin.org\nthat preschoolers of mothers with psychological IPV exposure tended to have more mental problems, and this association was partially mediated by restrictive and punitive parenting strategies (55). However, a cross-sectional study of 230 African American mothers and their children has failed to show a significant mediating effect of parenting styles in the association between maternal violence exposure and children\u2019s behavioral problems (57). The inconsistent findings suggested the need for further studies to confirm the mediating role of maternal parenting styles.\nThe mechanisms of the association between maternal IPV and children\u2019s adverse health outcomes remain unclear. Several hypotheses have been proposed by previous studies\nto explain such association. First, exposure to maternal IPV has been demonstrated to be detrimental to the emotional and neurological development in young children, who rely on their mothers to provide a safe and predictable environment where they can explore (58). However, when a mother herself was involved in IPV with stress, she usually failed to provide protection and care to her dependent children, which in turn could damage children\u2019s brain development in related domain and resulted in adverse health outcomes and reduced HRQOL (12, 59). Second, maternal IPV usually cooccurs with child maltreatment in the same family (60, 61). Children of mothers who were exposed to IPV had increased risk of emotional abuse, physical abuse, and neglect (60). This violent family\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 07 frontiersin.org\nIPV, intimate partner violence; HRQOL, health-related quality of life. (Adjusted for children\u2019 age, gender, status of single child, sleep duration, primary caregiver, maternal age, current marital status, educational level, and monthly per-capita income). aThe proportion of the total effect. *p < 0.05.\nclimate could impede children\u2019s development, leading to various physical and mental health issues, as well as poor HRQOL (62, 63). Third, parental stress has been demonstrated to be a significant predictor of poor psychosocial adjustment, leading to increased risk of mental dysfunction, such as depression, anxiety, and stress, in parents (14). Thus, as a highly stressful situation, suffering violence from an intimate partner could impair psychosocial adjustment in mothers (5, 64), which could interfere children\u2019s normal development (65, 66) and was associated with increased risk of children\u2019s psychosocial and behavioral problems (66), subsequently leading to reduced HRQOL. Last, maternal IPV experience has been found to be associated with less effective parenting skills and engagement, as well as more neglect and aggression (28), which might lead to more behavioral and psychological problems in\nyoung children (55, 67). Therefore, the significant association between maternal IPV and poorer HRQOL observed in our study was plausible.\nOur findings were consistent with previous evidence that family variables, such as background, family structure, and parenting stress, have great impact on children\u2019s development and adolescent adjustment (68\u201370). For example, a crosssectional study of 643 Portuguese adolescents have found that students from native families were more engaged in schools than those from immigrant families (68). Another cross-sectional study of 865 American adolescents has shown a significant link between family structure and behavioral problems, demonstrating that adolescents living with both natural parents were less likely to engage in deviant behaviors than those with single parent or stepparents (69). The present study further extends the findings of previous research by showing that even though maternal IPV negatively affects mothers and their children, parenting styles still have independent impact on children\u2019s wellbeing. These findings indicated that interventions targeting at parental support and rearing styles might have substantial benefit to the wellbeing of vulnerable children and adolescents, and even to their later-life health outcomes (71, 72).\nA major strength of this study was the usage of HRQOL as the outcome to fully reflect children\u2019s physical, psychosocial, and overall health. We have obtained sufficient mother-child dyads to reinforce the statistical power. Furthermore, we have adjusted for several available confounders in the regression models. The mediating role of parenting styles were also evaluated, which provided hints for intervention target. However, several drawbacks of this study should be considered as well. First, the cross-sectional design precludes us from concluding any causal relationship. Further longitudinal research is needed to elucidate the temporal associations. Second, all preschool children were included only from one megacity in China, which might cause selection bias. The representativeness of this study should be interpreted with caution. Third, we were unable to determine whether the timing and duration of IPV experienced by mothers had different impacts on their children\u2019s HRQOL (73, 74). Fourth, due to the young age of preschool children, HRQOL was measured with parent-proxy reports, rather than a child\u2019s selfperception, which is a common limitation faced by child health researchers (12, 75). Last, although we have adjusted for several confounders in the multivariate analysis, some reported risk factors of HRQOL were not included due to data unavailability (12, 75)."
