    "abstractText": "Mutually linked expression and methylation dynamics in the brain govern genome regulation over the whole lifetime with an impact on cognition, psychological disorders, and cancer. We performed a joint study of gene expression and DNA methylation of brain tissue originating from the human prefrontal cortex of individuals across the lifespan to describe changes in cellular programs and their regulation by epigenetic mechanisms. The analysis considers previous knowledge in terms of functional gene signatures and chromatin states derived from independent studies, aging profiles of a battery of chromatin modifying enzymes, and data of gliomas and neuropsychological disorders for a holistic view on the development and aging of the brain. Expression and methylation changes from babies to elderly adults decompose into different modes associated with the serial activation of (brain) developmental, learning, metabolic and inflammatory functions, where methylation in gene promoters mostly represses transcription. Expression of genes encoding methylome modifying enzymes is very diverse reflecting complex regulations during lifetime which also associates with the marked remodeling of chromatin between permissive and restrictive states. Data of brain cancer and psychotic disorders reveal footprints of pathophysiologies related to brain development and aging. Comparison of aging brains with gliomas supports the view that glioblastoma-like and astrocytoma-like tumors exhibit higher cellular plasticity activated in the developing healthy brain while oligodendrogliomas have a more stable differentiation hierarchy more resembling the aged brain. The balance and specific shifts between volatile and stable and between more irreversible and more plastic epigenomic networks govern the development and aging of healthy and diseased brain.",

            "text": "The human brain relies on the lifelong function of its diverse neuronal cell types. Most neurons emerge during development in the fetal and baby\u2019s brain and need to be maintained throughout adulthood. Neuronal health is governed by cellular programs, which need to be flexible to mediate neuronal plasticity, and yet stable to express a constant set of cell-type-specific genes throughout the life of the neurons [1]. During aging, the mechanisms that normally maintain health, stress resistance, and brain function decline, resulting in decrepitude, frailty, and the increased risk of aging-associated psychotic and\nCells 2022, 11, 362. https://doi.org/10.3390/cells11030362 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/cells\nCells 2022, 11, 362 2 of 44\nneurodegenerative disorders and also of cancer [2]. The dysregulation of transcriptional and chromatin networks is a crucial component of aging [3]. Hereby, epigenetic, changes including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and chromatin remodeling, profoundly affect cellular function, thereby contributing to the progression of aging and to age-related declines in cognition. Additionally, neuronal differentiation in early life is tightly regulated by transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms [4] with impact also for high-order cognitive functions such as learning and memory [5]. Molecular shaping during prenatal development via DNA methylation, histone modifications, and other molecular constituents of the epigenome are likely to play a critical role in the maintenance of neuronal health and function throughout the entire lifespan [6]. The dysregulation of any of these mechanisms can result in neuropsychiatric disorders, such as depression, schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorders [2,7]. Previous studies show that gene expression and DNAmethylation dynamics are largest from birth through infancy, after which these molecular profiles transition to a relatively stable state by young adulthood [8,9]. Later in life, DNA methylation drifts with age [10] with impact on other epigenetic marks, such as histone modification, in turn affecting chromatin states [11]. Overall, altered DNA methylation is among the central mechanisms in development, aging, and cellular senescence [12]. The aging and development of brain cancer are two interrelated processes, with aging being a major risk factor for the initiation of cancer. Analysis of epigenetic aging signatures of 25 cancer types revealed that DNA methylation patterns hardly reflect chronological age of cancer patients, but they are coherently modified in a non-stochastic manner, particularly at CpG (CG rich; see list of abbreviations below) islands that become hypermethylated upon aging in non-malignant tissues [13]. Brain cancer cells are diverse in their genetic, metabolic. and micro-environmental compositions, accounting for their phenotypic heterogeneity and disparate responses to therapy. These factors converge at the level of the epigenome, where aberrant epigenomes define many childhood and adult brain cancers, as demonstrated by widespread changes of DNA methylation patterns, redistribution of histone marks. and disruption of chromatin structure [14]. This coordinated regulation of cancer signatures seems to resemble aspects of aging and development. In a wider context, mutually linked expression and methylation dynamics in the brain govern regulatory mechanisms in the genome during development and aging occurring over the whole lifetime and determining the developmental stage and later the onset and the progression of aging [15]. Quantifying the extent and identity of transcriptional and epigenetic changes is therefore important for understanding development, aging. and related disorders and cancer [16]. In this publication, we have analyzed transcriptome and DNA-methylation data collected separately from human brain samples over the whole lifespan [9,17] (Figure 1). Our integrated analysis aims at systematically linking transcriptional programs and DNA-methylation changes as a function of age between early childhood and late adulthood. We decomposed molecular aging profiles into characteristic modes using self-organizing maps data portrayal, a machine learning approach proven in previous large-scale studies on transcriptome [18,19] and joint transcriptome/methylome data [20\u201322]. Hereby, we aimed to identify the functional context of the modes and their relation to epigenetic mechanisms such as the expression of genes encoding chromatinmodifying enzymes and of genes located in different chromatin states [23,24]. Finally, we compare the aging profiles of the healthy brain with expression and methylation data of brain cancer (lower-grade gliomas) and with gene signatures derived from psychotic disorders [16] in order to identify footprints of the respective pathophysiologies related to brain development and aging.\nCells 2022, 11, 362 3 of 44Cells 2021, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 45\nMicroarray-based gene expression data (Affymetrix HT-HG-U133A arrays) of postmortem human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (named for short \u201cbrain\u201d throughout the paper) were taken from the GEO database under accession number GSE11512 (see also [9,25]) covering the expression of, in total, 52,656 Affymetrix probe sets.

This \u201cspot-melting\u201d reveals partial decoupling of expression and methylation, meaning that only part of the expression of genes from the E-spots associates with anti-correlated alterations of methylation. The inverse mapping of M-spots into the E-map shows an analogous behavior, i.e., antagonistic changes of expression and methylation, spot melting, and accumulation of part of the genes in E-spot areas (Figure 4c). Similar results were obtained for gene sets either derived from transcriptomic or methylation data (Figure 4d). Set genes are more localized in E-spots if derived from expression data but \u201cmelt\u201d in the M-map and vice versa for gene sets obtained from methylation data. Overall, these results reflect the lack of a one-to-one relation between expression and methylation changes, as reported previously in cancer studies [20\u201322]. Additionally, aging studies reveal only weak correlation between DNA-methylation and transcriptome age predictors [41], suggesting that transcriptomics and epigenetics partly describe different aspects of biological aging. Interestingly, M-spot genes and methylation data derived gene sets often accumulate near the center of the map (see dashed circles in Figure 4c), referring typically to invariant genes (IV; see the variance and entropy maps in Figure 4e). The IV\nCells 2022, 11, 362 8 of 44\nregions in the E-maps indicate that a considerable part of genes that change their promoter methylation upon aging do not alter their expression in parallel. In turn, invariant methylation of genes changing expression seems weaker as suggested by the more distributed IV region in the M-map.

Highly expressed cellular programs shift from \u201ctranscription\u201d and \u201cnervous development\u201d (early childhood), via the \u201cregulation of synaptic plasticity\u201d and immune response (T-cells, interferon alpha/gamma response) towards lipid metabolism (late adults). Next, assuming deactivation of expression by promoter methylation as the basic effect, BP-sets were sorted with decreasing methylation upon aging (Figure 5a, right part). One finds promoter hypermethylation of genes involved in \u201ccell fate commitment\u201d and \u201cdifferentiation\u201d (early ages), then \u201cenergy homeostasis\u201d and later \u201cDNA repair\u201d and \u201cmitochondrion\u201d at later ages. For a better match of functions, we generated a joint heatmap of expression and methylation levels of the same set in each of the rows (Figure 5b). The sets can be divided roughly into three groups: (i) Gene sets showing increasing methylation and decaying expression with age were subsumed as \u201clearning\u201d-related involving developmental functionalities. (ii) The inverse relation, e.g., decaying methylation and increasing expression is observed for metabolic and inflammatory processes. (iii) Virtually positive correlations between expression and methylation were subsumed as repressive regulation including \u201cnegative regulation of differentiation\u201d and \u201cresponses to zinc and cadmium ions\u201d. The E-versus-M plots reveal curved courses where methylation changes level off at later ages while expression still changes. In terms of simple interactions (i) and (ii) trivially can be considered as repression of expression by promoter methylation while (iii) can be rationalized by inserting an intermediate repressive complex which effectively de-represses expression (RC, Figure 5b, right part). The latter interaction is partly compatible with mutually exclusive DNA methylation and PRC2 -mediated repression since PRC2 binds to hypomethylated CpGs [44]. The aging of healthy tissues is often accompanied by increasing inflammation (\u201cimmunoaging\u201d) and senescence at the cell level [45]. A series of immunity-related signatures indeed activate with age, e.g., activated CD4 cells, regulatory T cells, memory CD8 cells, and MHC I and II related signatures (Figure A4a). Other immune-related signatures, such as mast cells, activated CD8 cells, immature and activated B cells, macrophages, natural killer cells, however, decay with age showing maximum expression in childhood and/or early adulthood this way reflecting complex alterations of the immune environment in the brain. Interestingly, the accompanying methylation data reveal hypermethylation of a series of signatures (e.g., diverse CD8 cells, macrophages; see Figure A4b) in the fetal and babies\u2019 brains suggesting their transcriptional repression in the early development phase. Others, such as activated B cells and natural killer cells show decaying methylation in elderly people which associates with their transcriptional activation.\nCells 2022, 11, 362 10 of 44 Cells 2021, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 45\n3.5. Methylome Modifying Enzymes Govern Gene Activity and Methylation Dynamic chromatin regulation is a fundamental determinant of the developing and\naging neural network. Chromatin remodelers are critical determinants of this process with impact on health and disease [52]. Particularly, methylome modifying enzymes are an essential ingredient of the epigenomic machinery. They modulate the methylation of DNA and of a series of proteins affecting gene activity. For example, methylation of lysine (symbol K) side chains of the histone subunit 3 (symbol H3) at positions 4, 9, 27, or 36 (symbols H3K4, H3K9, etc.) affect the chromatin state, gene expression and, in turn, also DNA methylation mainly in the promoter region of the respective genes (see below and Figure 6a for a schematic overview). Methylation is regulated via methylating and demethylating enzymes writing or erasing the methylation marks to CpG islands, respectively [53,54]. Gene expression of a series of such enzymes shows pronounced changes either decaying or gaining with age (Figure 6b; see the two clusters marked in the heatmap). Expression of the DNA methylation maintenance methyltransferases Dnmt1 continuously decays with age on a logarithmic scale, while expression of the de novo methyltransferases Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b is high in babies and then sharply drops, suggesting\nnance (TM) via telomerase (TEL) and alternative (ALT) mechanisms [46], which possibly associate with human aging of brain tissue and neurodegenerative diseases as indicated by human cell line experiments and animal models [47\u201349].

Part of the ALT processes show the opposite\nCells 2022, 11, 362 11 of 44\ntrend, particularly, mechanisms leading to chromatin decompaction deactivate with age accompanied by anticorrelated methylation. Note, however, that these pathways also fulfill non-telomeric functions [46]. For example, TERT might be able to ameliorate the effects of toxic proteins such as amyloid-\u03b2, pathological tau, and \u03b1-synuclein involved in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s disease possibly by activation of autophagy [50]. Finally, we analyzed expression and methylation patterns of more than 50 KEGGpathways using pathway signal flow values [51] (Figure A6 and Supplementary Figures S3 and S4). Pathways show high transcriptomic activity either in babies and children, adults and late adults, or both with low activity at intermediate ages. In contrast, high methylation dominates in prenatal brains associating with their deactivation upon fetal development. In summary, we find serial activation of (brain) developmental, learning, metabolic and inflammatory functions upon aging, which mostly associate with anticorrelated methylation and expression changes and therefore suggest that changing methylation governs transcriptional programs mainly by direct repression or mediated via intermediate steps. Gene sets related to immune response and telomere maintenance show a complex behavior but overall seem to support immuno-aging and TM destabilization."

Expression of the DNA methylation maintenance methyltransferases Dnmt1 continuously decays with age on a logarithmic scale, while expression of the de novo methyltransferases Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b is high in babies and then sharply drops, suggesting that de novo methylation along the DNA associates with brain development at early age while methylation maintenance acts during whole lifetime (Figure 6c). Indeed, previous studies suggest an intimate link between synaptic events and nuclear Dnmt activity [55]. However, it is still unclear how neuronal activity regulates dynamic and reversible DNA methylation and how this can be influenced by Dnmts. A similar pattern as for methyltransferases is observed for DNA demethylases Tet1 \u2013Tet3, where Tet3 shows the more continuous decay than Tet1 and 2. Note that demethylation proceeds via a series of oxidation steps as sketched in Figure 6c right above. Tet activity has a stronger effect on the demethylation rate than Dnmt1 infidelity [56]. On the other hand, one cannot distinguish whether the effect of Tet activity on demethylation rate is due to bona fide active demethylation (base excision), or incomplete maintenance of oxidized methyl groups. Both, DNA methylases and demethylases are shown to play specific roles upon neuronal differentiation [7,57\u201361]. The decreasing transcriptional activity of maintenance methyltransferase during lifetime possibly associates with passive DNA-hypomethylation owing to the decaying restoration of methylation after cell division. Dnmt1 expression in post-mitotic neurons might serve to maintain DNA methylation after base-excision repair and it is required for maintaining DNA methylation [5]. On the other hand, it seems that decaying Dnmt1 activity adjusts to decreasing cell division rates and stemness-activity in the brain with age (Figure A11). The virtually constant methylation levels of stemness genes during adulthood support this view. The parallel decay of gene expression of writers\nCells 2022, 11, 362 12 of 44\nand erasers of DNA methylation presumably reflects a coupled equilibrium of methylating and de-methylating activity where, e.g., Dnmt1 antagonizes DNA demethylation and Tet3 antagonized hypermethylation, which, in turn, varies during lifetime. Indeed, a recent study on genome-scale methylation kinetics revealed highly variable and context-specific activity for the DNA methylation machinery [56]. Tri-methylation of lysine side chains of histone H3 at different positions can either activate (H3K4me3, H3K36me3) or repress (H3K9me3, H3K27me3) transcription according to the histone code (see Figure 6a and [31,62]). It further associates with different chromatin states such as active or repressed promoters (TssA, RepPC), heterochromatin (Het), and transcribed genes (Tx). The methylation of the K-side chains is regulated by a battery of lysine methyltransferases (symbol KTM) and demethylases (symbol KDM) showing overall very diverse aging profiles of their gene expression (Figure 6c). Typical courses reflect continuous gains (e.g., KMT6B alias EZH1) or decays (e.g., KMT3G alias WHSC1) or marked changes at early developmental stages (e.g., KMT6 alias EZH2 and KMT3C) or at later stages of aging (e.g., KDM5B and KDM5C). The detailed regulatory tasks of these enzymes are overall complex and beyond the scope of this publication (see, e.g., [24,63\u201365]). They comprise mono-, bi- and trimethylation steps, coupled functions affecting lysines at different positions, e.g., at K9 and K27, or along the gene, e.g., in the promoter or gene body regions. For example, modifiers of H3K4 methylation are needed for memory formation, shown through animal studies, and many of the same modifiers are mutated in human cognitive diseases and have been associated with impaired cognition in neurologic and psychiatric disorders [66]. Methylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27me3) is frequently found in the heterochromatin and conceives a repressive marker that is linked with gene silencing [67]. H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 associate with PRC2-repression and constitutive heterochromatin, respectively. Both contribute to stable gene repression through interactions with protein complexes involved in chromatin compaction. Mapping of the genes encoding the enzymes into the expression SOM, comparison of their positions with the different spots and their aging profiles suggests that modifications associating with transcriptional activation (i.e., methylation of H3K4 and H3K36 and demethylation of H3K27 and DNA) slightly precede modifications associating with transcriptional repression along the lifetime scale (Figure A7). In summary, expression of genes encoding methylome modifying enzymes is very diverse, reflecting complex regulations over one\u2019s lifetime. A larger part of them shows maximum expression in babies and children reflecting a governing role in brain development. Activating modifications seem to precede deactivating ones along the lifetime scale. Another part of the enzymes is activated in later phases of lifetime playing a role in aging.\nCells 2022, 11, 362 13 of 44\nCells 2021, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 13 of 45\nlifetime.

            "text": "Neuronal specification is driven by transcriptional programs, which are regulated by an interplay of epigenetics and transcription factor networks [73,74]. It is mediated by chromatin organization [75,76], which can be characterized by a series of chromatin states defined via combinations of histone modification at the affected nucleosomes [30,77]. For a more detailed view on epigenetic regulation, we analyzed expression and methylation levels of genes assigned to these different chromatin states referring to either the developing fetal or aging adult (midfrontal lobe) human brain only, or to both (overlap genes), which were taken from previous studies on a genome-wide scale [30,77]. Clustering of the expression and DNA-methylation profiles of the genes taken from the different states roughly provided three major groups including genes with (i) active (TssA) and poised (TssP) promoters, (ii) repressed (RepPC) promoters, and (iii) transcribed genes (Tx) and enhancer (Enh) states (Figure 7a,b). The genes of groups (i) and (ii) switch their expression levels from high to low upon aging, between fetal and adult brain states and between the two groups, respectively (Figure 7a). This means that, e.g., repressed states in the fetal brain show similar aging profiles as active and poised states in the adult brain and vice versa, and that expression of group (ii) in the adult brain resembles expression of group (i) in the fetal brain. In other words, expression of the genes from active and repressive states switch antagonistically between the developing fetal brain and the aging adult brain. These expression changes suggest the remodeling of chromatin states between the developing and aging brain in early and later lifetimes, respectively. In contrast to gene expression, DNA methylation of active and poised promoter states (group (i)) gains with age for all developmental groups (fetal only, overlap, and adult brain only, Figure 7b). Contrarily, methylation of overlap genes with repressed promoters (group (ii)) decays with age. A similar trend of hypomethylation was found for heterochromatin (Het state). The methylation changes of other states are less pronounced. The gene expression versus methylation correlation plots result in positive and negative slopes for repressive and active/poised states, respectively, which in turn can vary between the developmental stages (Figure 7c,d for a schematic summary). Polycomb group proteins generally mediate repression of gene expression via RepPC states. However, recent studies have revealed that PRC2 may contribute to gene activation via the establishment of PRC1-mediated enhancer\u2013 promoter interactions during brain development ([76] and references cited therein). The gene numbers in repressive promoter states and heterochromatin are relatively low in fetal brain only, but much larger in the overlap and adult brain which reflects the fact that a large number of developmental and stemness genes become switched off in differentiated brain tissue (Figure 7d). This relation reverses for active promoter states where the majority of genes are found in the fetal brain where development proceeds mainly under control of transcription factors regulating networks of active genes. Genes with poised promoters distribute roughly equally over fetal only, overlap and adult brain data suggesting that this promoter state plays a functional role during all stages of brain development and aging. Poised promoters are characterized by bivalent marks, the simultaneous presence of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, i.e., histone modifications associated with transcriptionally active and repressed chromatin, respectively. Bivalency is postulated to poise lineage-controlling of developmental genes for rapid activation during embryogenesis while maintaining a transcriptionally repressed state in the absence of activation cues. Recent studies show that bivalent chromatin however does not poise genes for rapid activation in the first instance but protects promoters from de novo DNA methylation [73]. This way bivalency represents a distinct regulatory mechanism for maintaining epigenetic plasticity by protecting reversibly repressed genes from irreversible silencing via DNA methylation. The similar gene expression and methylation profiles of poised/bivalent and active promoter states reflect a closely related functional impact where TssP states presumably form a reservoir of regulatory modes poised for reprogramming tasks of the cells.\nCells 2022, 11, 362 15 of 44\nCells 2021, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 15 of 45\n[78] (Figure 7c\u2013e). By contrast, permissive or \u201cplastic\u201d chromatin allows cell fate transitions. Upon aging restrictive chromatin in terms of heterochromatin states hypomethylates while permissive chromatin (TssA and TssP states) hypermethylate accompanied by anticorrelated expression changes thus suggesting less pronounced definition of the underlying cellular programs. Indeed, in young and healthy individuals, neural cells exhibit intact heterochromatin while aged cells show loss of heterochromatin as indicated by its hypomethylation accompanied by DNA damage accumulation, and the expression of aberrant transcripts [72]. The methylation of repressive states (RepPC) changes in both directions for overlap (hypomethylation) and adult brain only (hypermethylation) states which suggests their assignment to restrictive and permissive chromatin due to excess and suppressed activity, respectively [78]. In summary, the aging profiles of gene expression and DNA methylation of genes from different chromatin states reflect their remodeling between developing and aging phases of lifetime which includes repressive, active, and poised plasticity retaining states overall playing permissive and restrictive roles for the underlying cellular programs. Chromatin state remodeling contributes to the emerging patterns of cell fate specification leading to celltype diversity during brain development in early childhood indicating that neuronal plasticity depends on the availability of the DNA modification machinery [75].\nFigure 7.

            "text": "Aberrant DNA methylation, redistribution of histone marks, and disruption of chromatin structure in brain cancer, and particularly gliomas, are among the best described epigenetic changes underlying human pathology [22,29,79\u201385]. Hereby, cancer cells capitalize on cellular plasticity to acquire developmental programs that endow on self-renewal capacity with parallels to brain development. A particular subgroup of gliomas carrying mutation(s) in the IDH1/2 gene (IDH-mut) express the CpG island methylation phenotype (GCIMP), which is characterized by large-scale hypermethylation patterns mainly due to the oncometabolic repression of demethylating enzymes such as the Tet-type DNAmethylases but also selected histone modifiers. The aberrant methylation of gliomas seems to resemble, at least partly, the age-related methylation patterns of the healthy brain [20,29]. Lower-grade diffuse gliomas (LGG) are mainly IDH-mut tumors (about 85%), which makes them suited for comparing age and cancer-related effects. We here compare the whole genome methylation and expression patterns of the healthy brain with that of LGG taken from our previous studies using the classification of LGG into six methylation subtypes M1\u2013M6 of different characteristics including glioblastoma (GBM)-like IDH-wt (M1), IDH-mut astrocytoma-like (IDH-A, M2\u2013M4) and oligodendroglioma-like (IDH-O, M5) as well as neuronal (NL, M6) tumors (Figure 8; for the gene expression analysis see Figure A8) [20,21]. Comparison of the methylation landscapes by means of the pairwise correlation map, river flow plot, and number distributions reveals a clear shift with age from prenatal and newborns brain with similarity to M1 (IDH-wt), of babies and young children resembling partly astrocytoma-like IDH-A of the M4 group (highly methylated IDH-A core group), of adults with similarity to GCIMP-low IDH-A LGG of the M2\u2013M3 groups showing inflammatory characteristics of the tumor microenvironment and of elderly people with IDH-O LGG possessing relatively high proliferative characteristics (M5) (Figure 8a\u2013d). The NL subtype M6 is partly dominated by IDH-wt properties what explains its similarity with M1 methylation patterns. The observed similarity can be mainly attributed to the age profile of specific GCIMP genes differentially methylated between IDH-mut and IDH-wt gliomas [81] which resembles the aging profile of PRC2-targets weakly methylated in early developmental stages of the brain (Figure 8e). Recent studies show that PRC2-targets associate with open\nCells 2022, 11, 362 17 of 44\nchromatin states as well as with hypomethylation which is a key determinant of glioma stem cells ([86] and references cited therein). This epigenetic encoding of glioma supports the parallels between glioma differentiation and physiological neurodevelopment where stemness is also marked by PRC2 target hypomethylation. This maintains PRC2-targets in a hypomethylated, glioma stem-like state. Interestingly, also genes found hypermethylated in colon cancer (CRC CIMP genes) show a similar profile as GCIMP genes, thus reflecting cross-cancer similarities between gliomas and CRC and aging as well. Cycling and inflammatory genes show an antagonistic profile of decaying methylation with age (Figures 3, 5a and 8d), which anti-correlates with the respective expression profiles (Figure 5b). In consequence, the inflammatory IDH-A types M2 and M3 and the proliferating IDH-O type M5 (see [20]) resemble the aging stage of the adult and later adult brain, respectively. Note also that these results agree with a recent view that glioma progression along the M4-M2-M3 axis of immunogenic subtypes shows certain similarity with immunoaging and senescence at the cell level [45] driven by hypomethylation of associated genes and particularly of the olfactory subgenome involving G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR; see below) [20,21]. Recent single-cell transcriptomics studies [87] showed that IDH-mut gliomas are characterized by a developmental hierarchy from neuronal progenitors (NPC)-like cells towards two separate IDH-O and IDH-A cancer cell branches which corresponds to the increased age of healthy brain upon comparison with the tumors (Figure 8f). In contrast, IDH-wt are assumed to refer more to neurodevelopmental NPC-like plastic states resembling more the young healthy brain as observed. Note that this correspondence between glioma subtypes and the aging healthy brain refers to developmental stages of the underlying cellular programs and not to the age of incidence of the tumors, which appears in a different order, namely of largest age for IDH-wt gliomas (median age of incidence above 50 years) followed by IDH-O (about 45 years) and IDH-A observed in youngest patients (about 40 years) [21,88]. The major glioma subtypes show key-chromosomal defects, namely gains at Chr. 7 and losses at Chr. 10 for GBM-like IDH-wt gliomas and co-deletions at Chr. 1p/19q for IDH-O tumors resulting in dose\u2013response relations of genes located at these loci [20]. Interestingly, aging profiles of genes from these chromosomes of the healthy brain show overexpression for Chr.7 and underexpression for Chr.10 in babies and adolescent thus resembling the Chr.7+/Chr.10\u2212 dose responses of IDH-wt (M1) gliomas, while the aging profile of Chr.19 shows underexpression in elderly thus resembling the Chr.19\u2212 dose effect in IDH-O (M5) gliomas (Figures 8e and A9). In other words, the correspondence between age-related characteristics of the healthy brain and LGG is also reflected in agedependent chromosomal expression of healthy brain thus resembling the dose effects due to aberrant copy numbers in gliomas. The analogous similarity analysis between the aging brain and glioma subtypes using gene expression instead of DNA methylation delivers no clear correspondence between aging intervals and LGG subtypes (Figure A8). This result does not surprise on one hand because active cellular programs in neoplastic brain tissue differ substantially from that in the healthy brain. On the other hand, the observed correspondence of DNA-methylation patterns confirms the fact that cell-of-origin DNA methylation signatures are largely maintained during carcinogenesis [86,89,90]. In summary, comparison of aging brain with LGG supports the view that GBM-like IDH-wt LGG exhibit higher cellular plasticity activated in the developing healthy brain while IDH-mut LGG have a more stable differentiation hierarchy more resembling the aged brain (Figure 8f).\nCells 2022, 11, 362 18 of 44Cells 2021, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 18 of 45\nCells 2022, 11, 362 19 of 44"

            "text": "Next, we ask about relations between aging brain characteristics and psychiatric disorders. We made use of gene signatures taken from a comparative study of autism (AUT), schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BPD), major depression (DPR), and alcoholism (ALC) [16], and analyzed their gene maps and aging profiles in the expression and methylation domains of the aging brain (Figure 9). Most expression profiles show U- or inverse U-shaped profiles with maximum/minimum values in the ranges between infants, teenagers, and young adults and accumulation of the respective genes in the lowerright/upper-left part of the maps, respectively. The methylation profiles are relatively noisy because genes were selected from transcriptomic analyses (see above). Overall, expression and methylation profiles are mostly mirror-symmetrical thus reflecting virtually anti-correlation. The respective gene sets were assigned to different cell types such as neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and endothelial cells and associate with ALC, SCZ, AUT, and DPR, respectively (see [16] for details). The U-shaped characteristics resemble the hourglass-like courses of variability measures suggesting maximum vulnerability of relevant molecular processes in and around the adolescent age. Profiles of independent gene signatures confirm these results (Figure A11). For example, genes related to SCZ associate with astrocytes showing minimum activity in childhood-to-adolescent-young adult age ranges. Transcription of neurons (related to ALC), microglia (related to AUT) and oligodendrocytes, on the other hand is maximum in childhood and adolescent age ranges and decays with age. A monotonous decay of gene expression with age is observed for stemness and partly for senescence expression signatures (Figure A11). Note that the stemness signature was obtained from single cell transcriptomics of gliomas [93] while the senescence genes were extracted as senescence-associated hypermethylation signature [94] giving rise to decaying gene expression with age in both cases. Interestingly, both signatures however show different methylation courses suggesting different mechanisms acting via repression (senescence) and via intermediate repressive complexes (stemness), respectively (see above). U-shaped expression courses are also found for a series of additional gene signatures of different brain disorders (Figure A12) and, particularly, SCZ (Figure A13 and discussion in the legend). Note that U-shaped courses mean that a trend in early ages reverses in elderly people. Brain neuronal development strongly implicated in mental disorders [95] and alcohol abuse, undergo age-dependent changes with a marked decrease in oldness. Activation of neurotrophin signaling pathway during the first years of life and U-shaped activation profile in healthy subjects are detected where our previous studies indicated association of neurodevelopmental genes including neurotrophins with SCZ [96\u201398]. U-shaped expression profiles found for neurogenesis suggest a negative regulation indicative for alterations in neurotransmitter system in brain disorders in contrast to healthy individuals [99]. In summary, transcriptomic signatures of psychiatric disorders typically show U- or inverse U-shaped profiles with maximum/minimum in the children-to-young adult age ranges resembling that of spots B\u2013D or G, respectively. They associate with the maximum vulnerability of molecular processes in different brain cellular compounds such as neurons, microglia, or astrocytes, respectively. Assignment to distinct neuronal cell types based on previous knowledge and consideration of the corresponding age profiles of methylation provided different disease characteristics for AUT, SCZ, BPD, DPR, and ALC complementing the unique module-activity spectrum proposed in the original publication [16].

Hence, demethylation of these GPCR set seems to ssociate with tum r age of IDH-A type LGG, i.e., its devel mental stage. In the healthy brain, this trend goes parallel with hypo ethylation during aging especially during child- and adulthood.

Particularly, age profiles of sets of GPCR differentially expressed in AUT, SCZ, and BPD taken from [101] are considered. Genes encoding these GPCR were shown to be overrepresented in the lists of differentially expressed genes compared with normal controls and they partly overlap across the psychiatric disorders [101]. The age profiles reveal similar courses for up and downregulated genes where expression and methylation predominantly anticorrelate. The decay of the expression_DN profile of AUT starts at earlier ages than those of SCZ and BPD. Note that the GPCR extracted from all brain disorders show similar methylation profiles for up- and down-regulation, respectively, which throughout suggest repression of their expression. In summary, disease related GPCR show pronounced age dependence in the expression and especially methylation domains, where changes are most pronounced in early childhood."

Further, DNA methylation characterizes only promoter regions of the genes, and prenatal age (3 methylation samples) were not matched with expression data. Hence, our analysis might miss a number of regulatory interactions and the observation scale is relatively coarse within the different age intervals and also with respect to cellular and genetic resolution. Observed age-dependent changes likely point more to changes in cellular composition rather than developmental dynamics of a single cell type and thus demonstrate the predicaments when heterogeneous cell populations are examined [61]. Further, our analysis focused on DNA methylation leaving aging factors such as histone acetylation and DNA loopings formed by cohesin and CTCF unconsidered [110]. Despite these drawbacks, our analysis provides relatively highly resolved patterns of developmental and aging dynamics of brains gene expression and DNA methylation. It decomposes into a manifold of modes of different aging profiles such as monotonously and smoothly increasing, decaying, U- and inverse U-shaped (with maximum/minimum at intermediate ages), and profiles of steep changes at early and later ages as well. Promoter methylation and expression of downstream genes are anti-correlated as a rule of thumb, however, a large number of genes deviate from this simple relation. Overall, a clear one-toone relation is missing presumably because of the overlay of different regulatory effects not directly affected by methylation such as transcription factor networks [74], genetic defects [20,21], and/or passenger genes regulated indirectly by methylation changes in upstream drivers. We also observe positively correlated interactions where methylation activates expression. Such interactions possibly indicate interactions via an intermediate repressive complex such as PRC2 often acting mutually exclusive from methylation [44]. Along the lifetime scale, serial activation of these modes associates with functions such as neuronal development, maturated neuronal function such as synaptic transmission in babies and children, and later immune response and inflammation, metabolic and transcriptional activity in adults and elderly persons. Most changes, especially of the\nCells 2022, 11, 362 23 of 44\nmethylome, are established during development and childhood, while methylomes are less dynamic later in life. We find an hourglass-shaped transition of gene expression variance between two processes in adolescents\u2019 brains, which presumably refer to the finalization of neuronal development and maturation and the onset of aging in early adulthood. Another hourglass-shaped \u201cneurotypic\u201d region around birth was recently reported [35], where transcription specialization of processes involved in constructing brain circuitry in prenatal development decreases but afterwards post-natal development starts largely due to specialization of plasticity and neural activity processes subsumed as \u201clearning\u201d. Although resolution of our data is insufficient for clearly resolving this neurotypic region, we see strong changes of methylation in prenatal brains quickly levelling off after birth. U-shaped aging profiles indicate that gene expression changes with impact, e.g., for brain development and synaptic transmission. They reflect a partial reversal of developmental patterns upon aging, suggesting a link between developmental regulation and expression changes taking place in aging meaning that gene expression changes attributed to aging, such as down-regulation of neural genes, are initiated in early childhood. Hence, a number of regulatory processes continue throughout the entire life span where processes, beneficial in development, reverse direction and might be detrimental in aging [25]. Although aging induces diverse epigenetic changes in the brain, methylation appears to play a prominent regulatory role (Figure 11). The fastest changes occur during the prenatal period, slow down markedly after birth, and continue to slow further with aging [111]. The transition from fetal to postnatal life is typified by a reversal of direction, from demethylation prenatally to increased methylation postnatally. DNA methylation is strongly associated with expression of genes involved in brain development and in de novo DNA methylation. The methylation status can change bidirectionally, where restrictive DNA regions tend to become hypomethylated while many developmental genes in permissive chromatin regions become hypermethylated [11,13]. This way aging seems to disturb mechanisms of proper gene repression and activation. Importantly, utilizing genomic segments assigned to different chromatin states rather than individual CpGs will provide more comprehensive (epi-)genomic contexts to understand the intricate associations between genomic neighborhoods and developmental and aging processes. In contrast to most genetic lesions, DNA methylation is considered a reversible epigenetic mark which can vary during differentiation and in diseases such as cancer. Methyl groups can be added, removed, and interpreted by various classes of proteins collectively known as \u201cwriters\u201d, \u201cerasers\u201d and \u201creaders\u201d, respectively. The disruption of these epigenetic mechanisms and their molecular machinery can have catastrophic consequences on the nervous system. The local levels of DNA methylation result from opposing enzymatic activities, the rates of which are largely unknown. We here provided a glimpse at this area of regulatory mechanisms. The expression levels of writers, erasers, and readers of methylation marks at DNA and histone side chains are indeed highly dynamic in the developing and aging brain (Figure 11). Consequences for the particular genomic contexts are difficult to access because enzymatic rates can vary as much as two orders of magnitude between CpGs with identical steady-state DNA methylation outcome [56]. De novo methylation, as well as passive and active demethylation activities, is affected by local variations in chromatin, transcriptional activity, and transcription factor binding, leading to complex rate patterns which result in the steady-state methylation levels observed. Our data reveal a highly variable and presumably context-specific activity of the DNA and histone methylation machinery during lifetime.\nCells 2022, 11, 362 24 of 44\nCells 2021, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 24 of 45 disturb mechanisms of proper gene repression and activation.

Combined changes of DNA methylation, gene expression, and chromatin states relate\nto brain development and aging. DNA demethylation of restrictive chromatin and methylation of\npermissive chromatin activate/deactivate different cell functions with age in a mostly irreversible\nfashion. Differentiation of uronal tissue proceeds in active states which then become stabilized\nafter repression of developmental genes. Poised states maintain plasticity while PRC2-repressed\nstates maintain cellular identity of differentiated neuronal tissue. In particular, transitions between\nthe latter states are partly reversible due to (de-)methylation equilibria governed by the activity of methyl writing, erasing and reading enzymes, and a large battery of cofactors such as PRC2.\nWe observed accumulation of methylation in bivalent (poised, TssP) genomic regions with age which is likely to be a common process that occurs across tissue types [112,113]. In the aging brain, this accumulation might be targeted to loci with important roles in cell differentiation and development, and the closing off of these developmental pathways. On the other hand, for proper homeostasis and functioning of the adult brain, a balanced control of neural stem/progenitor cell self-renewal, differentiation, production of neurons and glia (known as \u201cadult neurogenesis\u201d), repair, learning, and memory, are important which requires a residual level of developmental plasticity [2]. Hereby PRC2 in adult neurons suppress the transcription of bivalent genes which protects neurons against degeneration. In other words, PRC2s contribute to the suppression of a transcriptional program that is detrimental to adult neuron function and survival. PRC2 deficiency in consequence leads to the de-repression of predominantly bivalent PRC2 target genes normally suppressed in these neurons leading to neuronal degeneration and dysfunction [73]. Recent results show that DNA methylation and PRC2 can coexist in several contexts suggesting that PRC2 might not necessarily have any preference for DNA methylation ([44] and references cited therein). The mutual exclusion of DNA methylation and H3K27me3 in the genome is probably dependent on context with unknown factors. Histone modifications affect chromatin states which trigger transcriptional processes that set neurons on a path of neurodegeneration [114]. The role of higher-order chromatin structure and DNA methylation in transcriptional regulation of brain disorders has been shown with considerable overlap of the genetic and epigenetic risk architecture, e.g., between SCZ, DPR, and BPD [55,115]. Comparison of aging brain with LGG revealed parallels, particularly that GBM-like IDH-wt LGG exhibit higher cellular plasticity activated in the developing healthy brain while IDH-mut LGG more resemble the aged brain. Hence, glioma development can be partly understood in terms of analogies of brain development along\nCells 2022, 11, 362 25 of 44\nthe aging axis in both directions depending on the glioma subtype. Aberrant methylation of the olfactory subgenome and particularly of G-protein coupled receptors observed in LGG [20,21] seems to be a more general, but largely not understood phenomenon with an impact on diverse brain disorders."

A more systematic understanding of the role and precise timing of age-associated changes in molecular players is required for a deeper insight into these processes. One important point in the role of epigenomic changes with age is the balance between volatile and stable and between more irreversible and more plastic networks. Understanding how genetic aberrations and environmental stimuli modulate these networks is required not only to increase our understanding of aging, but also of the initiation and courses of neuropsychological disorders and of cancer. Largerscale analyses and increased cellular resolution are needed to link molecular players such as gene expression and DNA methylation with neuronal nets and cognitive functions and their development and aging.\nSupplementary Materials: The following are available online at https://www.mdpi.com/article/10 .3390/cells11030362/s1, Table S1: Lists of genes referring to the expression spots, Table S2: Lists of genes referring to the methylation spots, File S3: PDF-files of KEGG pathway expression activities, File S4: PDF-files of KEGG pathway methylation levels.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, H.B., H.L.-W. and L.H.; analysis L.H., H.L.-W., H.B., M.S. and R.Z.; methods contributions, H.L.-W., L.H., M.S., A.A.; writing, H.B., H.L.-W. and A.A.; All authors have read and agreed to the published version of the manuscript.\nFunding: This research received no external funding.

These genes possibly describe active drivers while the KEGG genes seem to associate with ubiquitous loss of function processes upon aging which are common between Alzheimer, Huntington and Parkinson.\nCells 2022, 11, 362 38 of 44Cells 2021, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 39 of 45\nFigure A13. Expression and methylation characteristics of gene sets of different functional context related to schizophrenia taken from [121\u2013123]. In healthy subjects, inflammatory processes are activated during the first years of life and then decreased and became overexpressed in oldness (regulation of inflammatory response). U-shaped changes upon aging are shown for secretion of neurotransmission in brain disorders and healthy controls as well. The same applied for neuronal death related processes with the maximum at childhood. U-shaped changes are common for presynapse assembly disrupted in mental and behavioral disorders. No significant changes depending on age in case of processes involved in the innate immune response in healthy subjects are shown while several studies indicated altered innate immunity both in psychiatric disorders and ALC [124,125]. The main player of immunity, the compliment system suggested association with SCZ implicated a new risk factor for disease development [122]. On the other hand, evidence suggested contribution of abnormal apoptosis in brain and behavioral disorder [126]. Interestingly, cytokine and chemokine network implicated in the abovementioned disorders seems to be constantly expressed regardless the age [121,127,128]. In particular, a strong contribution of chemo-cytokine network to SCZ development indicated [121,123,129]. In contrast, genes enrolled in long-term neuronal synaptic plasticity regulation are expressed almost constantly over the time. Despite alterations in neurodevelopment are involved in mental disorders, genes underlying these processes seem to have no age-dependence.\nAppendix B. Tables\nTable A1.
