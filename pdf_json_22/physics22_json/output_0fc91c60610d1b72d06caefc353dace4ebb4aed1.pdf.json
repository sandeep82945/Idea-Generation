INTRODUCTION\nLepton flavor violating processes involving charged leptons (CLFV) are among the theoretically cleanest probes of physics beyond the standard model (BSM). The minimal model extending the standard model with neutrino masses predicts CLFV amplitudes proportional to m2\u03bd/m 2 W [1\u20134], leading to branching ratios 40 orders of magnitude below current experimental sensitivity and hence a huge discovery window. Moreover, CLFV processes also test the origin of flavor breaking in the lepton sector, ultimately related to the structure of neutrino mass matrices. So far, the strongest experimental bounds on CLFV have been given on \u03bc \u2192 e transitions. The current limit on the branching ratio of \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 is B\u03bc\u2192e\u03b3 < 4.2 \u00d7 10\u221213 at 90% C.L. [5], while that of \u03bc \u2192 e conversion in gold is B\u03bc\u2192e(Au) < 7 \u00d7 10\u221213 at 90% C.L. [6]. The next-generation searches aim to achieve higher sensitivities. For example, the MEG II experiment at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) is expected to reach\n*cirigv@uw.edu \u2020kfuyuto@lanl.gov \u2021mjrm@physics.umass.edu \u00a7erule@berkeley.edu\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

Funded by SCOAP3.\nB\u03bc\u2192e\u03b3 < 6 \u00d7 10\u221214 [7,8]. The Mu2e experiment at Fermilab and the COherent Muon to Electron Transition (COMET) experiment at Japan Proton Research Complex (J-PARC) plan to increase their sensitivity reaches by four orders of magnitude, i.e., to the level of B\u03bc\u2192e < O(10\u221217) [9\u201311].\nCompared to the nonhadronic decay \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 , the process for \u03bc \u2192 e conversion occurs in nuclei, wherein a muon is trapped to form a muonic atom. The \u03bc \u2192 e conversion process has the potential to discern signs of various BSM physics (for early studies see Ref. [12]), since it can be generated by not only photonic dipole operators but also nonphotonic contact four-fermion interactions involving two leptons and two quarks, with various Lorentz structures. Thus, estimations of the conversion process involve multiple scales (hadronic, nuclear, atomic) and require careful treatments. In light of the expected improvements in experimental sensitivity, in order to maximize the constraining power (in case of null signal) or the model-diagnosing power (in case of discovery), accurate theoretical predictions within various classes of models are desirable.\nThe calculation of \u03bc \u2192 e conversion rates has a long history, starting with the pioneering work of Weinberg and Feinberg [13], in which the electron wave function was taken as a plane wave and muon wave function was approximated to a constant. It was later realized that relativistic effects can be important in medium and heavy nuclei [14], and detailed calculation of the conversion rate including relativistic lepton wave functions was performed in Refs. [15,16]. The conversion rates in various nuclei and for dipole, scalar, and vector operators have been calculated in [16], where the uncertainty induced by neutron and proton densities in the\n2469-9985/2022/105(5)/055504(15) 055504-1 Published by the American Physical Society\nground state is also estimated. The discriminating power of various interactions in \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 and \u03bc \u2192 e conversion was further assessed in [17], where the uncertainty from scalar form factors was also discussed. The effect of nucleon spindependent operators was first discussed in Refs. [18,19] and effective field theory studies including renormalization group evolution, along with their phenomenological implications, have appeared [20\u201322]. Very recently, a nuclear-level effective theory for \u03bc \u2192 e conversion was developed [23].\nAmong the spin-independent operators, the largest theoretical uncertainties arise in the scalar sector. An improved treatment of scalar matrix elements based on SU(2) chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) was introduced in Ref. [24]. More recently, in the framework of SU(2) ChPT, the impact of next-to-leading order (NLO) nucleon interactions induced by quark-level scalar densities was discussed in Ref. [25]. The NLO contributions involve both single-nucleon scalar form factors and two-nucleon interactions, which were reduced in Ref. [25] to an effective one-nucleon interaction by performing an average of the interaction over a Fermi gas model. It was found that, when scalar operators are the dominant sources for the conversion process, the NLO interactions could bring destructive contributions relative to LO contributions and significantly reduce the branching ratio.\nInspired by those previous studies, we revisit the calculation of branching ratios of \u03bc \u2192 e conversion in several nuclei including the NLO nucleon interactions induced by scalar quark densities. Our analysis is performed in a modelindependent way, i.e., the standard model effective field theory (SM-EFT) [26\u201329], focusing on a particular class of SM-EFT operators: photonic dipole and scalar four-fermion operators. This setup is well motivated by BSM models with heavy scalar particles such as the two-Higgs doublet model and leptoquark models. As a byproduct of our analysis, we correct two errors appearing in [25]: (1) we eliminate two unhysical contributions to the overlap integrals (denoted by \u03c4 (2,3)) and (2) we provide a corrected expression and corresponding numerical result for the effective one-nucleon interaction resulting from the average over the Fermi gas model. We also develop a new method to include the momentum dependence of the scalar form factor in the overlap integrals. With these results at hand, we assess the NLO contributions to the conversion process and discuss the current hadronic and nuclear uncertainties. We discuss the prediction of this scalar-dominance model for the ratio of \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 over \u03bc \u2192 e conversion in 27Al and for the ratio of conversion rates in different target nuclei. Finally, we apply the analysis to a simple model in which CLFV is mediated by CLFV Yukawa couplings of the SM Higgs, which realizes the current setup.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we set up the EFT framework, starting from quark-level interactions and matching to nucleon-level interactions. In Sec. III we present the results for the overlap integrals and the \u03bc \u2192 e conversion rate, including NLO chiral effects. In Sec. IV we discuss the implication for scalar-mediated CLFV first in the EFT setup and subsequently in a model with \u201cminimal\u201d Higgs-mediated CLFV, i.e., an extension of the standard model in which the\nonly new interactions are CLFV Yukawa couplings of the Higgs to leptons. We present our conclusions in Sec. V and relegate some technical details to the Appendices."

In this case contributions from any BSM physics are captured by effective operators expressed in terms of SM fields, with appropriate couplings that contain information about the underlying model; this is the SM-EFT framework. We restrict our attention to a particular class of SM-EFT operators mediating CLFV transitions, namely the ones mediated by heavy scalar particles, including the SM Higgs itself. As our goal is to assess the uncertainties in scalar-mediated CLFV, we take as starting point below the electroweak scale the following effective Lagrangian (for a complete set of operators see Refs.

With this normalization, the chirality flip in lepton and quark bilinears is accompanied by a muon or a quark mass insertion, respectively.1 This choice comes without loss of generality and simplifies many intermediate steps in the analysis. Finally, the factors of mq and \u03b1s multiplying the quark scalar bilinears and the gluonic operator ensure that the corresponding Wilson coefficients do not run under QCD renormalization. After integrating out the heavy quarks, at the GeV scale the effective Lagrangian takes the form of Eq. (1), with q = u, d, s and [30]\nCG\u03b1 \u2192 CG\u03b1 \u2212 1/(12\u03c0 ) \u2211\nQ=c,b,t C(Q)S\u03b1 . (2)\nThe scalar quark operators in Eq. (1) induce single- and multi-nucleon momentum-dependent operators at low-energy, which eventually lead to nuclear transitions. The form of oneand two-nucleon operators has been derived to NLO in both SU(3) ChPT [31] and SU(2) ChPT [24,25,32,33], and we will work here in the SU(2) case.

(7)\nWe note that the first order Taylor expansion provides a representation of the full expression accurate to 2% for x 1 and to 5% for 1 < x 2. This means that it is quite safe to use the linear term in our nuclear analysis. In Appendix A, we show how the momentum-transfer expansion corresponds to derivative operators acting on nucleon density functions.\nThe hadronic scalar current defined in this way carries uncertainties due to both input parameters and higher order terms in the chiral expansion. Higher order terms in the momentumindependent part of the current are effectively resummed by using the physical values of \u03c3\u03c0N , \u03c3s, and \u03b4mN . The hadronic\ninputs entering Eqs.

(8d)\nFor the sigma term, we use as baseline input the analysis of the Roy-Steiner equations of Ref. [34], namely \u03c3\u03c0N = 59.1(3.5) MeV. This value is in tension with the (currently) more uncertain lattice QCD calculations (see [35] and references therein) which indicate \u03c3\u03c0N = 65(13) MeV (with dynamical charm quark [36]) and \u03c3\u03c0N = 40(4) MeV (no dynamical charm quark [37\u201339]). However, the recent lattice QCD analysis of Ref. [40] suggests that inclusion of excited state effects reconciles the tension, so we shall use the input from Ref. [34]. For the strange sigma term we use the lattice QCD average [35] \u03c3s = 41(9)MeV (with dynamical charm [41]), while for the slope we will take \u03c3\u0307s = 0.3(2) GeV\u22121 [42]. For the strong-isospin contribution to the nucleon mass splitting we take the lattice QCD determination \u03b4mN = 2.32(17) MeV from Ref. [43], consistent with the earlier lattice calculation of Ref. [44]. Finally, we take = 0.365(23) from the Flavour Lattice Averaging Group (FLAG) average [35].\nHigher chiral orders in the momentum dependence of the single-nucleon form factor are expected to be sizable. In fact, a comparison of the NLO heavy baryon ChPT prediction [45]\n055504-3\nwith a recent dispersive determination [42] indicates that the NLO result accounts for about 60% of the dispersive result.\nFinally, note that the one- and two-nucleon amplitudes \u03bcN (k) \u2192 eN (k\u2032) and \u03bcN (k1)N (k2) \u2192 eN (k\u20321)N (k\u20322) take the form\nA(1) = \u2212GF m\u03bc 2 \u2211 \u03b1=L,R N\u0304 \u2032J (1)\u03b1 N \u3008e\u0304P\u03b1\u03bc\u3009, (9a)\nA(2) = \u2212GF m\u03bc 2 \u2211 \u03b1=L,R N\u0304 \u20321N\u0304 \u2032 2J (2) \u03b1 N1N2 \u3008e\u0304P\u03b1\u03bc\u3009, (9b)\nwhere \u3008e\u0304P\u03b1\u03bc\u3009 denotes the leptonic amplitude, and the physically relevant combinations of hadronic scalar currents are\nJ (1)\u03b1 = J (1)ud,\u03b1 + J (1)s,\u03b1 + J (1)G,\u03b1, (10a) J (2)\u03b1 = J (2)ud,\u03b1 + J (2)G,\u03b1, (10b)\nwhich take the form\nJ (1)\u03b1 (q) = [ \u03c3\u03c0N \u2212 3m 3 \u03c0g 2 A 64\u03c0 f 2\u03c0 F ( q2/m2\u03c0 )]( C(0)S\u03b1 + 8\u03c0 9 CG\u03b1 ) \u2212 \u03b4mN 4 \u03c43 ( C(1)S\u03b1 + 16\u03c0 9 CG\u03b1 )\n+ (\u03c3s \u2212 \u03c3\u0307sq2) ( C(s)S\u03b1 + 8\u03c0\n9 CG\u03b1\n) \u2212 8\u03c0\n9 CG\u03b1mN , (11a)\nJ (2)\u03b1 (q1, q2) = \u2212 g2Am 2 \u03c0\n4 f 2\u03c0 \u03c31 \u00b7 q1 \u03c32 \u00b7 q2( q21 + m2\u03c0 )( q22 + m2\u03c0\n)\u03c41 \u00b7 \u03c42 ( C(0)S\u03b1 + 8\u03c0\n9 CG\u03b1\n) .

(12)\nThe NLO two-nucleon contribution can be reduced to an effective single-nucleon operator by averaging the twonucleon operator over a Fermi gas model of the target nucleus. In this approximation, the effect of J (2)\u03b1 is captured by the shift\n\u03c3\u03c0N \u2192 \u03c3\u03c0N \u2212 3g 2 Am 2 \u03c0kF\n64\u03c0 f 2\u03c0 f SIeff (13)\nin the first term in J (1)\u03b1 in Eq. (11a), where kF is the Fermi momentum in the target nucleus and f SIeff is the effective single-nucleon coupling resulting from averaging over the Fermi gas model. Although this procedure was carried out in [25], an error in that calculation resulted in incorrect results for the effective single-nucleon form factors f SI (q\u0304, k\u0304) and f SD(q\u0304, k\u0304) which propagated to all values obtained from these form factors. In Appendix C, we present the corrected expressions. The corrections significantly affect the values obtained after momentum-averaging, reducing the overall magnitudes by roughly a factor of 2 and leading to f SIeff = 0.43+0.03\u22120.22 and f SDeff = 0.43+0.03\u22120.22.\nAs discussed in Ref.[25], the effective coupling f SIeff obtained through the Fermi gas average is likely an overestimate of the underlying two-nucleon contribution. This expectation is based on a study of nuclear anapole moments [47] where, in addition to the Fermi gas average, nuclear shell model wave functions were used to directly evaluate a variety of two-nucleon currents\u2014none of them the operator of present concern\u2014in the nuclei 133Cs and 205Tl. Across all the currents tested, the Fermi gas average tended to overestimate the two-nucleon contribution by 2\u20133 times compared to the shell model.\nTo verify that this behavior persists in the present case, we evaluated the two-nucleon operator using shell model wave\nfunctions for two of our nuclei of interest, 27Al and 48Ti. Details of this calculation are presented in Appendix B. Fully correlated shell model wave functions were generated for 27Al and 48Ti using the configuration-interaction code BIGSTICK [48,49] and the USDB 1d5/2\u20132s1/2\u20131d3/2 [50] and GXPF1 1 f7/2\u20132p3/2\u20132p1/2\u20131 f5/2 [51] interactions, respectively. Harmonic oscillator bases with oscillator parameters b of 1.84 and 1.99 fm for Al and Ti, respectively, were employed in the calculations.\nThe effective one-body couplings which reproduce the shell model results are given in Table I. We find that the Fermi gas average estimate is \u22482\u20133 times larger than the shell model\nTABLE I. Input parameters and resulting values of the effective one-body operator coupling parameter f SIeff for the four nuclei of interest: qT is the magnitude of the three-momentum transfer, computed via Eq. (C6), kF is the nuclear Fermi momentum obtained by linear interpolation in A between the values measured in [46], Rp (Rn) and a are the parameters of the proton (neutron) density profile, f SIeff,FGA is the value of the spin-independent form factor obtained via the Fermi gas average, and f SIeff,NSM is the value implied by the nuclear shell model calculation (without additional correlation function). The upper uncertainty of f SIeff,FGA is due to the error incurred in the momentum average over k\u0304 and the uncertainty in the Fermi momentum (\u00b15 MeV) whereas the lower uncertainty reflects the expectation that the FGA result tends to overestimate the strength of the operator by roughly a factor of 2.

Although we did not carry out the shell model calculation for the heavy nuclei 197Au and 208Pb, given that the anapole study observed the overestimation in 205Tl, it is likely that a similar result would be found for 197Au and 208Pb in our case.\nThe shell model results may still represent an overestimation of the two-nucleon contribution. The shell model wave functions that we employ are constructed in very soft Hilbert spaces which lack the high-momentum modes necessary to properly resolve the strong repulsion of two nucleons at short distance. We find that the two-nucleon operator is sensitive to the short-range nucleon-nucleon physics. Introducing an ad hoc short-range correlation function [52] in the shell model calculation further reduces the estimated strength of the twonucleon operator by \u224850%. For this reason, the value of f SIeff obtained from the shell model calculation can likely be considered as an upper limit on the strength of the two-nucleon contribution. A complete treatment involving the introduction of effective operators and wave function renormalization to account for the truncated shell model space is beyond the scope of this paper."

(35)\nIn our analysis, we employ the two-parameter Fermi model for the proton and neutron densities,\n\u03c1N (r) = \u03c10 1 + e(r\u2212RN )/a , (36)\nthe parameters of which are given in [56] for Al, Au, and Pb and in [57] for Ti. We reproduce these parameters in Table I. The nucleon density profiles for Al, Au, and Pb include a separate determination of the neutron density from measurements of pionic atoms, whereas for Ti we have only the proton density, determined from electron scattering. In this case, we assume Rn = Rp.\nIt should be noted that, assuming me = 0, one can obtain relations between two electron states, g(e)\u22121 = \u03b1 f (e)+1 and f (e)\u22121 = \u03b2g(e)+1, with \u03b1/\u03b2 = \u22121. We evaluate overlap integrals taking\n2We have numerically checked that the fourth derivative term is roughly two orders of magnitude smaller than the second derivative. Therefore, we neglect higher-order derivatives in fN (r).\n\u03b1 = \u22121 and \u03b2 = 1, leading to \u03c4 (+1)D = i\u03c4 (\u22121)D and \u03c4 (+1)S = \u2212i\u03c4 (\u22121)S in the massless limit.3\nTable III shows the results of the dimensionless overlap integrals \u03c4 (\u00b11)D , \u03c4 (\u00b11) \u03c1N , and \u03c4 (\u00b11)fN for 27 13Al, 48 22Ti, 197 79 Au, and 208 82 Pb. We find that the values of the momentum-dependent overlap integrals \u03c4 fN for Al and Ti are roughly a factor of 2/3 smaller than the corresponding momentum-independent integrals \u03c4\u03c1N . In heavier nuclei, \u03c4 fN is further suppressed relative to \u03c4\u03c1N .\nIn the case of nonzero CLFV couplings to u and d quarks, we can compare the LO contributions with those from the NLO interactions by defining the following quantities:\nILO(\u00b1)N \u2261 \u03c3\u03c0N m\u03bc \u03c4 (\u00b11)\u03c1N , (38)\nINLO(\u00b1)N,loop \u2261 \u2212 3g2Am 3 \u03c0m\u03bc\n64\u03c0 f 2\u03c0\n5\n12 \u03c4\n(\u00b11) fN , (39)\nINLO(\u00b1)N,2N \u2261 \u2212 3g2Am 2 \u03c0kF m\u03bc\n64\u03c0 f 2\u03c0 f SIeff \u03c4 (\u00b11) \u03c1N . (40)\nThe resulting values for the nuclei of interest are presented in Table IV, where input parameters such as \u03c3\u03c0N and f SIeff are fixed at their central values. As discussed in [25], the NLO nucleon interactions bring negative relative contributions compared to the LO value, thereby reducing the overall \u03bc \u2192 e decay rate. The NLO loop contribution to the amplitude is less than 5% of the LO contribution, while the two-nucleon interactions roughly amount to 10%. If we assume C(1)S\u03b1 /C (0) S\u03b1 = O(1), then isospin-breaking terms give only 1% corrections to ILON since (\u03b4m/4)/\u03c3\u03c0N \u2248 0.01. This assumption, however, may be violated in some underlying new physics model.\nIn the case of the strange quark, the NLO correction arises only from the momentum-dependent term, \u03c4 fN . Taking the\n3The overlap integrals defined in [16] are obtained by scaling \u03c4 (\u22121)D and \u03c4 (\u22121)\u03c1N as\nD = 4\u221a 2 m5/2\u03bc \u03c4 (\u22121) D , S (N ) = 1 2 \u221a 2 m5/2\u03bc \u03c4 (\u22121) \u03c1N .

Assuming equivalent Wilson coefficients C(0)S\u03b1 = C(s)S\u03b1 , the total (LO + NLO) contribution to the CLFV amplitude from the strange quark is reduced by \u224830% in Al and Ti and \u224820% in Au and Pb, relative to the contribution from u, d quarks.\nIn contrast to the light quarks, the NLO contributions to the gluonic coupling CG\u03b1 are less than 1% relative to the leading term which is dominated by the nucleon mass. Recalling the relation between the heavy quark (q = c, b, t ) Wilson coefficients and the gluonic coupling, Eq. (2), we find that the prefactor of the heavy quark Wilson coefficients in Eq. (32) is \u224820% larger than the prefactor of the isoscalar coupling\nTABLE IV. The LO and NLO contributions [defined in Eqs. (38)\u2013(40)] in units of MeV2.

Only right-handed down-type operators are nonzero in the upper plot, while the lower plot takes all the right-handed operators to be nonvanishing. In both cases, the nonzero Wilson coefficients are assumed to be equal; that is, C (d )SR = C (s)SR = C (b)SR in the upper plot, and similarly in the lower plot. \u03c4\n(\u22121) S,c is obtained by taking central values of input parameters.\nC(0)S\u03b1 . Therefore in cases where the CLFV quark couplings are independent of flavor, such as the Higgs-mediated model considered in Sec. IV, the heavy quarks give the largest contribution to the CLFV amplitude (ignoring the intrinsic gluon coupling and the dipole contribution), though all quark flavors contribute at a similar order.\nFigure 1 explores the dependence of the ratio \u03c4 (\u22121)S /\u03c4 (\u22121) S,c on the two input hadronic parameters \u03c3\u03c0N and \u03c3s as well as the parameters of the NLO nucleon interactions, as discussed in Sec. II.4 \u03c4 (\u22121)S,c is estimated by fixing all the parameters at their central values. Each bar in the plot is obtained by varying one parameter (indicated on the right) in the 1 \u03c3 range while the rest of the parameters are fixed at the central values. The upper panel presents the case with nonzero right-handed down-type operators, while the lower panel includes all right-handed operators.\n4Since the errors in , \u03b4m, and kF are negligible, we do not include them in our analysis.\n055504-7\nThe first two bars in each panel depict the effect of varying \u03c3\u03c0N and \u03c3s. The third bar takes into account the error of the effective one-body coupling f SIeff in Table I. The lower uncertainty reflects the fact that the central value of f SIeff obtained from the Fermi gas average is likely too large by a factor of 2. We find a corresponding increase in the value of \u03c4 (\u22121)S by \u22481\u20132 % relative to \u03c4 (\u22121)S,c when f SIeff is reduced by half. The last two bars correspond to the NLO loop contributions, which are denoted as 1N FF (form factor). For the light quark contributions defined by 1N FF (u, d), we assign a 50% error to the value of INLON,loop. On the other hand, 1N FF (s) represents the variation of \u03c3\u0307s.\nOverall, the variation of the ratio in the lower plot is small compared to the upper plot. This is because, as discussed in [24], the case has two additional heavy-quark contributions, leading to less impacts from the parameters that we currently focus on. We find that the scalar contribution is dominantly affected by the uncertainty in \u03c3s, which roughly amounts to \u00b17% (3%) for the Cd,s,bSR (Cq=allSR ) = 0 case. Varying all of these parameters, we see that the deviations from the central value of \u03c4 (\u22121)S,c are roughly \u00b110% and \u00b15% for the upper and lower cases, respectively.\nThe relative importance of the NLO contributions can depend significantly on the underlying CLFV physics. In particular, when CLFV primarily arises from light quark scalar couplings the NLO contribution can in fact be larger than the LO uncertainty. We illustrate this with the following two examples:\n(i) If only the two lightest quarks contribute, C(u)S\u03b1 \u2248 C(d )S\u03b1 = O(1) and C(q=s,c,b,t )S\u03b1 = 0, then the 1\u03c3 uncertainty on the LO result for B\u03bc\u2192e(Al) is \u00b113%, whereas the NLO contribution reduces the LO branching ratio by roughly 25%. If the strange quark contributes as well, C(s)S\u03b1 = O(1), then the LO uncertainty on B\u03bc\u2192e(Al) is \u00b119% while the NLO contribution is 23%. In this case, the impact of LO strange quarks is comparable in magnitude to that of the LO light quark uncertainties as well as the NLO light quark contribution.\n(ii) Assuming C(q)S\u03b1 \u2248 1/yq in both cases, i.e., nonzero C(q=u,d )S\u03b1 and C (q=u,d,s) S\u03b1 , we see that the negative NLO\ncontributions are \u224825%, which is consistently larger than the LO uncertainties \u2248 \u00b113%. This is because the two light-quark contributions dominate the conversion process if the scalar operators are generated with mqC (q) S\u03b1 = O(1).\nThis analysis implies two important take-home messages: (1) the overall uncertainty is dominated by the LO amplitude, in particular by the sigma terms; (2) the central value of the NLO corrections could be larger than the uncertainty on the LO term if light quarks (q = u, d) have nonzero LFV couplings, making the analysis of NLO effects phenomenologically relevant. As we find in the next section, the relative significance of the NLO contributions can be diminished in scenarios with large contributions from either gluonic couplings generated by heavy quarks or dipole operators.\nIt should be noted that in our analysis we have adopted a central value and uncertainty for the two-nucleon contribution based on the Fermi gas model. In light of the nuclear shell model results and their strong dependence on short-range correlations, it is at present impossible to rigorously quantify the uncertainty in the two-nucleon sector. Nonetheless, it is reasonable to regard the values considered here as an upper limit on the relative strength of the two-body contribution (and in turn the NLO contribution)."

In this parametrization, the dominant contribution to the \u03bc \u2192 e conversion switches from the scalar operator to the dipole one around r \u2248 10\u22126. The band in the upper plot is obtained by taking the 1\u03c3 range of the input parameters (\u03c3\u03c0N , \u03c3s, \u03c3\u0307s, , \u03b4m), the uncertainty in f SIeff from Table I, and a 50% error in the one-body form factor. For example, at r = 10\u22127 where the scalar operator dominates B\u03bc\u2192e(Al), the uncertainty in B\u03bc\u2192e(Al)/B\u03bc\u2192e\u03b3 corresponds to \u00b120%, which can be understood from the analyses of \u03c4\n(\u22121) S /\u03c4 (\u22121) S,c in the previous section. On the other hand, taking the ratio of the conversion processes between two nuclei, one can see that the uncertainty becomes negligible as seen in the lower plot. Here, we take the central values of f SIeff for Al and Ti, since we expect that the uncertainty in the effective one-body coupling is correlated across all isotopes. We see differences of a few % from the results in [17].\nHowever, it should be noted that the ratio B\u03bc\u2192e(Ti)/B\u03bc\u2192e(Al) is affected by the uncertainty in the overlap integrals due to the neutron densities. As given in Table I, the uncertainty in the neutron density parameter Rn determined from pionic atom experiments is roughly 6% in 27Al. This propagates to a 5% error in the neutron overlap integrals for Al.

            "heading": "V. CONCLUSIONS",
            "text": "In this paper we have studied \u03bc \u2192 e conversion in nuclei within a class of models in which lepton flavor violation is induced dominantly by the exchange of scalar particles, such as the SM Higgs. We have estimated the \u03bc \u2192 e conversion rate in several nuclei of experimental interest, including NLO effects in the one- and two-nucleon interactions in chiral effective theory. The one-nucleon effects involve the momentum dependent scalar form factor, and we have developed an efficient method to take into account the momentum dependence in the overlap integrals. The two-nucleon terms are evaluated both by reducing them to one-body terms via an average over a Fermi gas model (as done in Ref. [25]) and within the nuclear shell model. The two approaches provide a way to estimate the uncertainty associated with the two-body NLO contribution. In the process, we correct the result of Ref. [25], finding a smaller effective one-body interaction and hence a smaller impact on the \u03bc \u2192 e conversion rates.\nFor the light-quark scalar operators, the NLO corrections interfere destructively with the LO terms. At the amplitude level, the NLO form-factor contribution is at the 5% level, while the two-nucleon interactions amount to about 10%, with a total NLO impact on the decay rates at the 20\u201330% level. We provide an uncertainty budget for the conversion amplitude at LO and NLO and find that the overall uncertainty is dominated by the LO amplitude, in particular by the sigma terms. Importantly, we find that the central value of the NLO corrections could be larger than the uncertainty on the LO term, making the analysis of NLO effects phenomenologically relevant.\nWe studied the implications of our results for testing scalar-mediated CLFV processes. For the phenomenologically interesting case of Higgs-mediated CLFV, in which both scalar and dipole operators appear at low-energy, we have shown that (i) in the next-generation experiments \u03bc \u2192\n7The LO results are B\u03bc\u2192e(Al)/B\u03bc\u2192e\u03b3 = (9.0 \u00b1 0.3) \u00d7 10\u22123 and B\u03bc\u2192e(Ti)/B\u03bc\u2192e(Al) = 1.5 \u00b1 0.1.\ne conversion will have stronger sensitivity than \u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 to the CLFV Yukawa couplings Y\u03bce,e\u03bc; (ii) ratios of branching ratios such as B\u03bc\u2192e(Al)/B\u03bc\u2192e\u03b3 and B\u03bc\u2192e(Al)/B\u03bc\u2192e(Ti) can be predicted with quantified uncertainties. In particular, B\u03bc\u2192e(Al)/B\u03bc\u2192e\u03b3 is affected by NLO corrections at the same level as LO uncertainties. These ratios offer a clean path towards testing the Higgs-mediated CLFV scenario in case of discovery in the next-generation experiments."

            "text": "Let us consider \u03bc \u2192 e conversion mediated by a generic scalar operator of the form\nOL,R(x) = e\u0304(x)PL,R\u03bc(x) q\u0304(x)q(x). (A1) In the more commonly studied case of lepton scattering (electron or neutrino scattering), one typically uses the mode expansion of the leptonic fields in terms of plane waves. Later on, we will consider this case as a consistency check on the formalism we use. However, it turns out that using plane waves is not the most convenient choice for the problem of \u03bc \u2192 e conversion. In this case it is more convenient to perform the mode expansion of the leptonic field in terms of solutions to the Dirac equation in the Coulomb field of the nucleus. The muon initial state corresponds to the 1s hydrogen-like state, while the electron final state corresponds to an outgoing wave in the continuum, with energy given by the muon mass minus the binding energy B\u03bc.\nThe scalar Hamiltonian at low energy takes the form H\u0302L,R = CL,R \u222b d3x e\u0304(x)PL,R\u03bc(x) S\u0302(x), (A2)\nwhere CL,R \u2261 1/ 2L,R are dimensionful Wilson coefficients and S\u0302(x) is the hadronic realization of the quark scalar density. In chiral EFT this operator contains terms like N\u0304N , \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212, etc. Its matrix element between free nucleon states takes the form\n\u3008p f | S\u0302(x) |pi\u3009 = eix\u00b7(p f \u2212pi ) gS ((p f \u2212 pi )2), (A3)\n055504-10\nwhere gS (q2) is the nucleon scalar form factor (for simplicity we do not display isospin indices here and throughout the discussion). In the regime we are working, we could further Taylor expand the scalar form factor as follows:\ngS (q 2) = g0 + g2q2 + g4(q2)2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (A4)\nUltimately, we wish to have a nonrelativistic realization of the scalar density operator, to be inserted between nuclear many-body wave functions. We denote this object by \u02c6\u0302S(x) and we determine its form by requiring that the matrix elements within free one-nucleon states are the same in the two representations. Explicitly,\n\u3008p f | S\u0302(x) |pi\u3009 = \u222b d3x1 e ix1\u00b7(pi\u2212p f ) \u02c6\u0302S(x; x1). (A5)\nUsing Eq. (A3) and the Taylor expansion of the form factor, one can verify that the desired coordinate-space representation of the scalar density involves the delta function and its derivatives,\n\u02c6\u0302S(x; {x j})\n= A\u2211\ni=1\n[ g0 \u03b4 (3)(xi \u2212 x) \u2212 g2 \u22072xi\u03b4(3)(xi \u2212 x) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ] ,\n(A6)\nwhere the summation runs over nucleons. With this result at hand, the conversion amplitude takes the form\n\u3008 fg| H\u0302L,R |\u03bc(1s)\u3009 = CL,R \u222b d3x \u3008e f | e\u0304(x)PL,R\u03bc(x) |\u03bc(1s)\u3009\n\u00d7 \u3008 0({x j})| \u02c6\u0302S(x; {x j}) | 0({x j})\u3009, (A7) where | 0\u3009 is the nuclear many-body ground state wave function. The leptonic matrix element is expressed in terms of the solutions of the Dirac equation \u03c8 (e),(\u03bc)(x):\n\u3008e f | e\u0304(x)PL,R\u03bc(x) |\u03bc(1s)\u3009 = \u03c8\u0304 (e)(x)PL,R\u03c8 (\u03bc)(x). (A8) The electron wave function has an oscillatory behavior with frequency set by m\u03bc \u2212 B\u03bc, but it is not a plane wave. For the nuclear part of the matrix element one has\n\u3008 0({x j})| \u02c6\u0302S(x; {x j}) | 0({x j})\u3009\n= \u222b\nd3x1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 d3xA \u22170 (x1, . . . , xA) \u02c6\u0302S(x; {x j}) 0(x1, . . . , xA), (A9)\nand using the definition of one-body density8 \u03c1 (1)(x) = \u222b d3x2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 d3xA | 0(x, x2, . . . , xA)|2, (A10)\nwe arrive at\n\u3008 0({x j})| \u02c6\u0302S(x; {x j}) | 0({x j})\u3009 = g0 \u03c1 (1)(x) \u2212 g2 \u22072\u03c1 (1)(x) + g4 \u22074 \u03c1 (1)(x) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 .\n(A11)\n8Note that with this definition the proton and neutron densities are normalized as \u222b\u221e 0 dr 4\u03c0r 2\u03c1p(r) = Z and \u222b\u221e 0 dr 4\u03c0r 2\u03c1n(r) = A \u2212 Z .\nand hence \u3008e f | H\u0302L,R |\u03bc(1s)\u3009 = CL,R \u222b d3x \u03c8\u0304 (e)(x)PL,R\u03c8 (\u03bc)(x)\n\u00d7 [g0 \u03c1 (1)(x) \u2212 g2 \u22072\u03c1 (1)(x) + g4 \u22074\u03c1 (1) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ]. (A12)\nThis result, together with the relations \u22072\u03c1N (r) = (1/r)\u22022/\u2202r2[r\u03c1N (r)] and \u22074\u03c1N (r) = (1/r)(\u22022/\u2202r2)2[r\u03c1N (r)], implies the form of the transition amplitude used in Eqs. (31)\u2013(35).\nEquation (A12) involves derivatives acting on the nucleon densities in the nuclear ground state and differs from the standard results encountered in the analysis of lepton-nucleus scattering. In the case of lepton scattering, the external leptonic wave functions are plane waves, and the analog of Eq. (A12) becomes (here q = p f \u2212 pi is the leptonic momentum transfer)\n\u3008p f | H\u0302L,R |pi\u3009 = CL,Ru\u0304(pe)PL,Ru(p\u03bc) \u222b d3x eiq\u00b7x\n\u00d7 [g0 \u03c1 (1)(x) \u2212 g2 \u22072\u03c1 (1)(x) + g4 \u22074\u03c1 (1) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ]. (A13)\nAfter integration by parts one recovers the familiar factorized form\n\u3008p f | H\u0302L,R |pi\u3009 = CL,Ru\u0304(pe)PL,Ru(p\u03bc)\n\u00d7 gS (q2) \u222b d3x eiq\u00b7x \u03c1 (1)(x). (A14)\nThe factorized form of (A14) does not directly apply to \u03bc \u2192 e conversion because the leptonic wave fuctions \u03c8 (\u03bc)(x) and \u03c8 (e)(x) are not plane waves. However, one can perform a Fourier decomposition of \u03c8 (\u03bc)(x) and \u03c8 (e)(x) and apply (A14) to each term in the double Fourier expansion in pe and p\u03bc, leading to\n\u3008e f | H\u0302L,R |\u03bc(1s)\u3009 = CL,R \u222b dpedp\u03bc u\u0304(pe)PL,Ru(p\u03bc)\n\u00d7 gS (pe \u2212 p\u03bc)2 \u222b d3x ei(pe\u2212p\u03bc )\u00b7x \u03c1 (1)(x).\n(A15)\nThis form is equivalent to (A12) but in practice, as long as gS (q2) can be approximated by a few terms in its series expansion around q2 = 0, Eq. (A12) is computationally more convenient than (A15)."

(C5)\nThese functions depend not only on the magnitude of the dimensionless momentum transfer q\u0304 and average momentum k\u0304, but on their relative angle. Fortunately, for the physically relevant values of these momenta, f SI and f SD do not vary significantly over the range of possible angular values. Therefore we may replace each function by its angular average. The angle-averaged functions then depend only on the magnitude of the momentum transfer q\u0304 and the average momentum k\u0304. For a given nucleus, the three-momentum transfer in coherent\n\u03bc \u2192 e conversion satisfies\nq2T MT m\u03bc + MT [( m\u03bc \u2212 Ebind\u03bc )2 \u2212 m2e], (C6)\nwhere MT is the mass of the target nucleus and Ebind\u03bc is the (positive) binding energy of the captured muon. Fixing the value of qT for a given nucleus, f SI and f SD become functions of the dimensionless average nucleon momentum k\u0304, as shown in Fig. 4. In order to recover a local one-body effective\n055504-13\noperator, we replace these slowly varying functions of k\u0304 by a constant, weighting our average by the single-nucleon momentum probability distribution. The resulting momentum-\naveraged values f SIeff and f SD eff are shown in Fig. 4. Table I reports the values of f SIeff for the four nuclei of interest as well as the physical parameter values employed in each calculation.\n[1] S. T.
