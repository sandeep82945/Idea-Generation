Temporal Landmarks and Behavior Change in Smoking Cessation Across Different Populations: Investigate how the concept of using temporal landmarks, like Mondays, for encouraging behavior change applies across different populations, including various age groups, cultural backgrounds, and socioeconomic statuses. This research could examine whether the effectiveness of a Monday-enhanced smoking cessation program is consistent or varies significantly among diverse groups.

Digital and Social Media Integration into Smoking Cessation Programs: With the increasing use of digital platforms and social media, future research could focus on integrating these tools into smoking cessation programs. This could include creating online communities, using apps for tracking progress and providing support, and leveraging social media for motivational messaging. The effectiveness of these digital interventions, compared to or in conjunction with traditional methods, would be a primary focus.

Comparative Studies of Different Weekly Landmarks: While the paper focuses on the effect of Mondays as a temporal landmark for smoking cessation, future research could explore whether other days of the week, or even other temporal landmarks (such as the first day of a month or season), have similar or better impacts on smoking cessation outcomes. This could help tailor smoking cessation programs more effectively to individual preferences or cultural significances attached to certain days.

Long-term Follow-up on Smoking Cessation and Relapse Rates: A longitudinal study that follows participants of Monday-enhanced and standard smoking cessation programs over a longer period (e.g., one to five years) could provide valuable insights into the long-term effectiveness of these programs. This research could also explore factors influencing long-term abstinence and relapse, including personal, social, and environmental factors.

COVID-19's Impact on Smoking Behavior and Cessation Efforts: Given the interruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, a study dedicated to understanding how pandemics and related stressors affect smoking behaviors and cessation efforts could be valuable. This research could explore how to adapt smoking cessation programs to maintain effectiveness during such crises, including the use of virtual platforms and the role of peer support in a socially distanced context.
