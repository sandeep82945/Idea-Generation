However, the determination of the true transference number from experiments is rather demanding. On the other hand, the Bruce\u2013Vincent method is widely used in the lab to approximately measure transference numbers of polymer electrolytes, which becomes exact in the limit of infinite dilution. Therefore, theoretical formulations to treat the Bruce\u2013Vincent transference number and the true transference number on an equal footing are clearly needed. Here, we show how the Bruce\u2013Vincent transference number for concentrated electrolyte solutions can be derived in terms of the Onsager coefficients, without involving any extrathermodynamic assumptions. By demonstrating it for the case of poly(ethylene oxide)\u2013lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide system, this work opens the door to calibrating molecular dynamics (MD) simulations via reproducing the Bruce\u2013Vincent transference number and using MD simulations as a predictive tool for determining the true transference number. \u00a9 2023 Author(s).

While important progress has been made in the quest for determining the true transference number, notably with the combinations of concentration cell and steady-state measurements1 or electrophoretic nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR),2 its determination in polymer electrolytes remains difficult in practice. The usage of steady-state currents for the determination of transport coefficients dates back to experiments of Wagner on metal oxides and sulfides.3 It is Bruce and Vincent4 who first derived the equivalence of such measurements to determine the transference number of Li ions in polymer electrolytes. The method should give the true transference number in the limit of infinite dilution; however, it becomes approximated in concentrated solutions where the ion\u2013ion correlations become non-negligible. Nevertheless, the Bruce\u2013Vincent method4 remains the most widely used one in the lab to gauge the transference number because of its simplicity. Computations of the true transference number t + from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have come on the scene recently, which allow for a direct comparison between the theory and experiment. However, due to the challenge in measuring the true transference and the high accessibility of the Bruce\u2013Vincent transference number t+,ss from experiments, it would be desirable to also obtain the Bruce\u2013Vincent transference number directly from MD simulations. In this communication, we derive t+,ss with the Onsager equations of ion transport and apply the method to the PEO\u2013LiTFSI [poly(ethylene oxide)\u2013lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide] system using MD simulations. By clarifying the extrathermodynamic assumptions used previously, we show that t+,ss has a welldefined connection with the Onsager coefficients and can be computed from MD simulations accordingly with a proper consideration of the reference frame (RF). Comparing the experiment and simulation for the PEO\u2013LiTFSI system, we observe a consistent trend of its reduction with respect to its dilute limit, determined by the self-diffusion coefficients of ions.

(3)\nIt is important to understand that the above relation is only valid in the solvent-fixed RF, which is the reason that the Onsager coefficients \u03a90+0 and \u03a9 0 \u22120 related to the solvent species can be omitted. The flux of anions is set to be zero in Eq. (3) by applying the anion-blocking condition at the steady-state,4,9 and this allows us to express the flux of cations just using the electrochemical potential of cations alone,\nJ0+,ss = \u2212(\u03a90++ \u2212 (\u03a90+\u2212) 2/\u03a90\u2212\u2212)\u2207\u03bc\u0303+,ss. (4)\nThe initial current density due to the migration of both cations and anions is\nitot = \u2212\u03c3\u2207V (5) = \u2212z2F2(\u03a90++ +\u03a90\u2212\u2212 \u2212 2\u03a90+\u2212)\u2207V , (6)\nwhere \u0394V = \u2212d\u2207V is the applied potential and \u03c3 is the ionic conductivity. It is clear from Eq. (5) that the applied potential \u0394V in this context stands for the one after excluding any potential drop due to\nthe charge-transfer resistance at the interface. A similar procedure is also used in the experiment by subtracting the iRct term.8,9\nThen, the Bruce\u2013Vincent transference t+,ss as the ratio between the steady-state current (density) i+,ss and the initial current (density) itot can be expressed as follows:\nt+,ss = i+,ss itot = zFJ\n0 +,ss\nitot (7)\n= \u239b \u239d\n\u03a90++ \u2212 (\u03a90+\u2212) 2/\u03a90\u2212\u2212\n\u03a90++ +\u03a90\u2212\u2212 \u2212 2\u03a90+\u2212 \u239e \u23a0 \u2207\u03bc\u0303+,ss \u2207(zFV) . (8)\nTherefore, the key step for obtaining t+,ss is to establish the relationship between the change in the electrochemical potential of cations at the steady-state \u0394\u03bc\u0303+,ss and the applied potential \u0394V .\nFollowing the notations from Fawcett,10 the Galvani potential difference at the Ma\u2223solution interface Sa \u0394Ma \u03d5 is defined as\nSa \u0394Ma \u03d5 = \u03d5Ma \u2212 \u03d5Sa\n= \u2212 \u0394G\u25cbMz+/M\u25cb\nzF + RT zF ln aMz+a , (9)\nwhere \u0394G\u25cbMz+/M\u25cb is the standard free energy for the reduction reaction of Mz+ and aMz+a is the activity of M\nz+ near the anode. The same applies to the cathode side with the Galvani potential\ndifference Sc \u0394Mc \u03d5 as\nSc \u0394Mc \u03d5 = \u03d5Mc \u2212 \u03d5Sc\n= \u2212 \u0394G\u25cbMz+/M\u25cb\nzF + RT zF ln aMz+c . (10)\nThen, the potential difference between the two electrodes Mc \u0394Ma \u03d5 can be obtained by combining the two equations above,\nMc \u0394Ma \u03d5 = Mc \u0394Sc \u03d5+Sc \u0394Sa \u03d5 + Sa \u0394Ma \u03d5\n= RT zF ln (aMz+a /aMz+c ) + (\u03d5Sa \u2212 \u03d5Sc). (11)\nIt is worth noting that Mc \u0394Ma \u03d5 does not account for any potential drop developed at the electrode\u2013electrolyte interface/interphase due to the charge-transfer resistance, which allows us to apply the Nernst equation to the Galvani potential difference here.\nBy identifying Mc \u0394Ma \u03d5 = \u0394V , \u0394\u03bc+,ss = RT ln (aMz+a /aMz+c ), and \u0394\u03d5ss = \u03d5Sa \u2212 \u03d5Sc and applying the definition Eq. (1) of the electrochemical potential of cations, the above equation can be rewritten as follows:\nzF\u0394V = \u0394\u03bc+,ss + zF\u0394\u03d5ss (12) = \u0394\u03bc\u0303+,ss. (13)\nPlugging Eq. (13) into Eq. (8), we get the following expression:\nt+,ss = \u03a90++ \u2212 (\u03a90+\u2212) 2/\u03a90\u2212\u2212 \u03a90++ +\u03a90\u2212\u2212 \u2212 2\u03a90+\u2212 , (14)\nwhich is the main result of this work. For the infinitely dilute solution, \u03a90+\u2212 becomes zero and there are also no correlations among the same type of ions. Therefore, one\nJ. Chem. Phys. 158, 161104 (2023); doi: 10.1063/5.0146608 158, 161104-2\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2023\n12 January 2024 19:17:26\nrecovers the apparent transference number tapp, which only depends on the self-diffusion coefficients Ds, i.e.,\nlim r\u21920\nt+,ss = t+,app = Ds+\nDs+ +Ds\u2212 . (15)\nBefore showing how to compute the Onsager coefficients from MD simulations and taking care of their RF-dependence, it is necessary to make a connection of Eq. (14) with previous studies,1,11 where similar results were either implied or indicated but with seemingly rather different assumptions.\nThe point for discussion is whether the assumption regarding the relationship between the chemical potentials of cations and anions matters or not. For this purpose, consider the general case where \u03bc+ = x\u03bc\u2212. The linear relation between the steady-state flux and the driving forces under the anion-blocking condition reads\n\u2212 \u23a1\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a3 J+,ss 0 0 \u23a4\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a6 =M \u23a1\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a3 \u2207\u03d5ss \u2207\u03bc+,ss \u2207\u03bc\u2212,ss \u23a4\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a6\n(16)\nwith\nM = \u23a1\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a3 \u03a90++ \u03a9 0 +\u2212 0 \u03a90+\u2212 \u03a9 0 \u2212\u2212 0 0 0 1 \u23a4\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a6 \u23a1\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a3 zF 1 0 \u2212zF 0 1 0 1 \u2212x \u23a4\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a6 . (17)\nGiven that the only non-zero term on the left-hand side is J+,ss, the driving forces can be represented in terms of J+,ss, x, and \u03a9 by inverting the linear relation, which leads to\n\u2207\u03d5ss = \u2212 J0+,ss zF x\u03a90+\u2212 +\u03a90\u2212\u2212 (x + 1)(\u03a90++\u03a90\u2212\u2212 \u2212 (\u03a90+\u2212) 2) ,\n\u2207\u03bc\u2212,ss = \u2212zF \u03a90+\u2212 \u2212\u03a90\u2212\u2212\nx\u03a90+\u2212 +\u03a90\u2212\u2212 \u2207\u03d5ss,\n\u2207\u03bc+,ss = x\u2207\u03bc\u2212,ss.\n(18)\nEquation (18) seems complicated, but one can verify that they reduce to the same set of equations reported in the literature under specific choices of x, namely, x = 0 as in Ref. 1 and x = 1 as in Ref. 11.\nImportantly, the following two combinations of the driving forces are x-independent:\n\u2207\u03bc+,ss + zF\u2207\u03d5ss = \u2212 \u03a90\u2212\u2212\n\u03a90++\u03a90\u2212\u2212 \u2212 (\u03a90+\u2212) 2 J\n0 +,ss, (19)\n\u2207\u03bc+,ss +\u2207\u03bc\u2212,ss = \u03a90+\u2212 \u2212\u03a90\u2212\u2212\n\u03a90++\u03a90\u2212\u2212 \u2212 (\u03a90+\u2212) 2 J\n0 +,ss. (20)\nThis is certainly not a coincidence, as the left-hand side of Eq. (19) is related to \u0394\u03bc\u0303+,ss, which corresponds to the applied potential \u0394V , and that of Eq. (20) is proportional to the chemical\npotential of the salt. In both cases, these are the quantities that can be measured in experiments.\nWhen taking the ratio between Eq. (19) and Eq. (20), one can relate the chemical potential change of the salt \u0394\u03bcsalt = \u0394\u03bc+,ss + \u0394\u03bc\u2212,ss to the corresponding potential difference \u0394\u03d5salt defined as\n\u0394\u03d5salt = RT zF ln(\u03b3\u00b1,a ma \u03b3\u00b1,c mc ), (21)\nwhere \u03b3\u00b1 is the mean activity coefficient and m is the molal salt concentration. Then, this leads to the expression of \u0394\u03d5salt in terms of the applied potential and the Onsager coefficients as\n\u0394\u03d5salt = RT 2zF ln(aa ac ) = (\u03a9 0 \u2212\u2212 \u2212\u03a90+\u2212 2\u03a90\u2212\u2212 )\u0394V , (22)\nwhere aa and ac are the salt activities near anode and cathode, respectively. This recovers the dilute limit (\u03a90+\u2212 \u2192 0), in which \u0394\u03d5salt is equal to half of the applied potential at the steady-state.4\nTherefore, what we reveal here is yet another example of the Gibbs\u2013Guggenheim principle,12,13 stating that chemical potentials of individual ions are a mathematical construct and cannot be measured experimentally without extrathermodynamic assumptions (e.g., the choice of x in this case). Nevertheless, what matters is that t+,ss is a well-defined quantity and its derivation in terms of the Onsager coefficients does not need to involve any of these extrathermodynamic assumptions.\nNow, we are ready to apply Eq. (14) to the PEO\u2013LiTFSI system by using MD simulations. The simulations were performed using the GROMACS14 package and the General AMBER Force Field (GAFF)15 at 157 \u25cbC because of a much higher glass transition temperature T g found in the simulation system.16 Further details regarding the simulation setup and the force field parameterization can be found in previous studies.16,17\nThe Onsager coefficients under the barycentric RF (denoted as M) can be readily computed from the displacement correlations as a function of time t,\n\u03a9Mi j = limt\u2192\u221e \u03b2 6VN2At \u27e8\u0394rMi (t) \u22c5 \u0394rMj (t)\u27e9, (23)\nwhere \u03b2 is the inverse temperature, V is the system volume, NA is the Avogadro number, and \u0394rMi (t) is the total displacement of species i over a time interval t. The long-time limit is estimated by fitting the correlation as a linear function over the interval 10\u201320 ns, which was shown to reach the diffusion regime in a previous study.5\nTo compute t+,ss, it is necessary to convert the Onsager coefficients from the barycentric RF to the solvent-fixed RF (denoted as 0) using the transformation rule5\n\u03a90i j = \u2211 k,l\u22600 A0Mik \u03a9 M kl A 0M jl\n= lim t\u2192\u221e \u03b2 6VN2At \u22c5 \u27e8 \u239b \u239d\u2211k\u22600 A0Mik \u0394r M k (t) \u239e \u23a0 \u22c5 \u239b \u239d\u2211l\u22600 A0Mjl \u0394r M l (t) \u239e \u23a0 \u27e9, (24)\nwhere A0Mi j is the matrix converting the n \u2212 1 independent fluxes in an n-component system from the barycentric RF to the solventfixed one. Equation (24) shows how this transformation relates to\nJ. Chem. Phys. 158, 161104 (2023); doi: 10.1063/5.0146608 158, 161104-3\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2023\n12 January 2024 19:17:26\nthe correlations of ions. The detailed derivation of such a relation from constraints of the fluxes and driving forces can be found elsewhere.18,19 An important implication from these works is that when the response relation as shown here is applied in other RFs, it also entails a corresponding RF transformation of these driving forces.\nThe results of the computed t+,ss for the PEO\u2013LiTFSI system in comparison with experiments are shown in Fig. 2, together with those of t+,app. It is found that t+,ss is always positive as expected since both the diagonal Onsager coefficients and the determinant are positive; the same is true for t+,app and the two quantities approach each other at the dilute condition. In addition, the relation t+,ss < t+,app seems to hold for the entire range of concentration, in both the simulation and experiment.\nGiven that the measurements of Bruce\u2013Vincent transference numbers are accessible in most labs and t+,ss does reflect a defined facet of the ion\u2013ion correlations, this work provides a way to calibrate the MD simulations of polymer electrolytes and concentrated electrolytes alike by reproducing t+,ss. Through a quantitative comparison and calibration, this will allow us to use MD simulations as a predictive tool to obtain the true transference number t0+ for new types of polymer platforms beyond PEO.\nThis work was supported by the Swedish Research Council (VR), Grant No. 2019-05012.
