    "abstractText": "Four couples of 5,6-membered bis(metallacyclic) Pt(II) complexes with acetylide and isocyanide auxiliary ligands have been prepared and characterized. The structures of (\u2212)-2 and (\u2212)-3 are confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, showing a distorted square-planar coordination environment around the Pt(II) nucleus. Both solutions and solid samples of all complexes are emissive at RT. Acetylide-coordinated Pt(II) complexes have a lower energy emission than those isocyanidecoordinated ones. The emission spectra of N\u02c6N\u2032*C-coordinated Pt(II) derivatives show a lower energy emission maximum relative to N\u02c6C*N\u2032-coordinated complexes with the same auxiliary ligand. Moreover, the difference between cyclometalated N\u02c6N\u2032*C and N\u02c6C*N\u2032 ligands exerts a more remarkable effect on the emission than the auxiliary ligands acetylide and isocyanide. Cytotoxicity and cell imaging of luminescent 5,6-membered bis(metallacyclic) Pt(II) complexes have been evaluated.",

When the classical five-membered metallacycle (C\u02c6N) is extended to a six-membered chelating metallacycle (C*N) using an amine connector, N\u02c6C*N\u2032- and N\u02c6N\u2032*C-coordinated Pt(II) complexes show a much more perfect square-planar geometry compared to N\u02c6C\u02c6N\u2032- and N\u02c6N\u2032\u02c6C-coordinated Pt(II) complexes [7,8]. Through tuning coordination geometry, the rectified square structure of a 5,6-membered bis(metallacycle) may maximize the strength of the ligand field and minimize the nonradiative metal-centered transitions, so N\u02c6C*N\u2032-, N*N\u2032\u02c6C-, and C\u02c6N*N\u2032-coordinated complexes are highly emissive with an appreciable emission quantum efficiency (\u03a6em) [9,10]. Strassert et al. investigated oxygen-sensing behaviors of porous materials that phosphorescent (C\u02c6N*N\u2032)Pt(II) complexes encapsulated in Zn-based metal\u2013organic frameworks [11]. In addition, Huo et al. demonstrated that a 5,6-membered bis(metallacycle) of platinum complexes could be selectively formed through either the sp2 or the sp3 C\u2013H bond activation, which can be used in selective C\u2212H bond activation, C\u2212N bond cleavage, and selective acylation [12\u201314].\nAlthough the square geometry is improved by forming a 5,6-membered bis(metallacycle), introducing a 5,6-membered bis(metallacycle) would increase molecular flexibility, which is adverse to the emission efficiency. The rectified geometry may alone seem not to result in a large d orbital splitting enough to eliminate thermally accessible nonradiative d\u2013d transition, and N\u02c6C*N\u2032- and N\u02c6N\u2032*C-coordinated Pt(II) chloride complexes may be weakly emissive [7,8]. Acetylide and isocyanide ligands induce a much stronger ligand field than the\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6369. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28176369 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6369 2 of 16\nchloride, which could efficiently raise the nonradiative d\u2212d transition to higher energy, leading to a big jump in emission efficiency in cyclometalated N\u02c6C\u02c6N\u2032- and N\u02c6N\u2032\u02c6C-coordinated Pt(II) complexes [15,16]. Therefore, introducing strong donors such as acetylide and isocyanide may be a suitable alternative. The emissions of N\u02c6C*N\u2032- and N\u02c6N\u2032*C-coordinated Pt(II) phenylacetylene and isocyanide derivatives are highly intensive, with \u03a6em exceeding 40% [9]. The phosphorescent phenylacetylene derivatives could be utilized as triplet photosensitizers for triplet-triplet annihilation upconversion [10]. In previous work, we reported a series of pinene-fused N\u02c6C\u02c6N\u2032-, N\u02c6N\u2032\u02c6C-, N\u02c6C*N\u2032-, and N\u02c6N\u2032*C-coordinated Pt(II) complexes and investigated their solvent-, mechano-, vapor-, and thermo-induced color, luminescent, and chiroptical switching behaviors [17\u201319]. Pinenecontaining N\u02c6C*N\u2032- and N\u02c6N\u2032*C-coordinated Pt(II) complexes displayed significant AIE properties in the THF-water solution system by restricting intramolecular vibration and rotation in the poor solvent. A reversible mechanochromic luminescence was found for the N\u02c6N\u2032*C-coordinated Pt(II) chloride complex, and its potential utility in an anti-counterfeiting application was attempted [19]. As an extension, acetylide and isocyanide ligands are introduced in pinene-containing N\u02c6C*N\u2032- and N\u02c6N\u2032*C-coordinated Pt(II) complexes (Scheme 1). Four pairs of 5,6-membered bis(metallacyclic) Pt(II) complexes were characterized by NMR, HRMS, and elemental analysis, and the structures of (\u2212)-2 and (\u2212)-3 were unambiguously confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. We studied all obtained complexes\u2019 photophysical and luminescent properties and explored their cytotoxic properties and applications in cell imaging.\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 18\naccessible nonradiative d\u2212d transition, and N^C*N\u2032- and N^N\u2032*C-coordinated Pt(II) chloride complexes may be weakly emissive [7,8]. Acetylide and isocyanide ligands induce a much stronger ligand field than the chloride, which could efficiently raise the nonradiative d\u2212d transition to higher energy, leading to a big jump in emission efficiency in cyclometalated N^C^N\u2032- and N^N\u2032^C-coordinated Pt(II) complexes [15,16].

The Pt-C(aryl) distances (2.050(8) and 2.052(8) \u00c5) and Pt-C(isocyanide) distances (1.89(2) and 1.97(2) \u00c5) of (\u2212)- 2 are comparable to those in the reported Pt(N\u02c6N\u2032\u02c6C)C\u2261N derivatives [21\u201323]. Due to chelating ring strain, Pt-C(aryl) bond lengths are close to Pt-N(trans position) distances. For complex (\u2212)-3, two carbon atoms are located at a trans position, and Pt-C(aryl) distances (1.994(9) and 1.986(9) \u00c5) differ Pt-C(isocyanide) bonds (2.049(10) and 2.053(9) \u00c5) by less than 0.05 \u00c5, owing to a stronger ligand of the aryl carbon atom [9,24]. Both Pt atoms in complexes (\u2212)-2 and (\u2212)-3 reside in a distorted square-planar environment. However, the tridentate chelating strain in the flexible 5,6-membered bis(metallacycle) is relieved relative to the five-five-membered ring, correspondingly the degree of distortion in N\u02c6C*N\u2032- and N\u02c6N\u2032*C-coordinated Pt(II) complexes is alleviated [7\u20139,19]. In addition, the C1-Pt1-N1 and C3-Pt2-N3 chelating angles (171.9(6) and 172.7(6)\u25e6) in N\u02c6N\u2032*C-coordinated (\u2212)-2 are close to more linearity compared with those angles (168.0(4) and 168.7(4)\u25e6) in N\u02c6C*N\u2032-coordinated (\u2212)-3 (Table S2). The isocyanide aryl ring is almost coplanar with the Pt(N\u02c6N\u2032*C) moiety in (\u2212)-2 with dihedral angles being 0.948 and 2.643\u25e6 (Figure S13), which resembles those in cyclometalated Pt(II) isocyanide complexes [21\u201323]. In contrast, phenylacetylene is commonly twisted with Pt(II) coordination plane, and the torsion angles between phenylacetylene and Pt(N\u02c6C*N\u2032) unit in (\u2212)-3 are 36.817 and 41.976\u25e6 [9]. Moreover, the Pt-C(alkynyl) bond bends distinctly away from the Pt(N\u02c6C*N\u2032) plane with a distance of 0.32 \u00c5 between the C(alkynyl) atom and the plane, while the C(isocyanide) atom deviates from the Pt(N\u02c6N\u2032*C) plane by 0.18 and 0.10 \u00c5 (Figure S14). To minimize the steric interaction between the uncyclometalated N-phenyl and neighboring cyclometalated aryl groups in flexible 5,6-membered bis(metallacyclic) Pt(II) complexes [7\u20139,19], the N-phenyl group is significantly twisted with the Pt(II) coordination plane with torsion angles extending from 73.15\u25e6 to 79.71\u25e6\n(Figure S15). The amino nitrogen in a flexible six-membered metallacycle is 0.20\u20130.37 \u00c5 from the platinum-centered plane (Figure S14). No substantial intermolecular Pt\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 Pt interactions are detected in either (\u2212)-2 or (\u2212)-3. The dimers in (\u2212)-2 are aligned alternately into a one-dimensional head-to-tail chain through weak \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 contacts along the a-axis (Figure 2).

The solvent influence on absorption has also been studied. The low energy absorption bands provide a slightly hypsochromic shift with the increased polarity of the solvents (Figures S20\u2013S23), confirming the charge transfer (CT) character [25,26]. The chiral characteristics of all complexes have been determined through ECD (electronic circular dichroism) spectra (Figures S24\u2013S27). Mirror-symmetric profiles can be detected for enantiomers. Positive Cotton effects below 350 nm that originate from chiral pinene ligands are observed for (\u2212)-1, (\u2212)-2, (\u2212)-3, and (\u2212)-4. In addition, weak Cotton effects in the low-energy region are exhibited [19]. Chiral environments around the central Pt nucleus are insignificant due to the nearly square-planar geometry of 5,6-membered bis(metallacyclic) Pt(II) complexes.

Both complexes (\u2212)-1 and (\u2212)-3 display a vibronically structured emission with \u03bbmax at 493 and 511 nm and shoulders at 528 and 541 nm, respectively (Figure 3 and Table 2). In contrast, a nearly structureless band in the orange region with lower energy emission peaks at 578 and 595 nm is perceived for complexes (\u2212)-2 and (\u2212)-4, respectively. Acetylide-coordinated Pt(II) complexes have a lower energy emission in CH2Cl2 solution than those isocyanide-coordinated ones (\u2206\u03bb = ca. 20 nm) (Figure 3 and Table 2), which is consistent with their absorption spectra. In addition to this, the emission spectra of N\u02c6N\u2032*C-coordinated Pt(II) derivatives show a lower energy emission maximum relative to N\u02c6C*N\u2032-coordinated complexes with the same auxiliary ligand (\u2206\u03bb = ca. 80 nm) (Figure 3 and Table 2). The difference between cyclometalated N\u02c6N\u2032*C and N\u02c6C*N\u2032 ligands exerts a more remarkable effect on the emission than the auxiliary ligands acetylide and isocyanide. The emission dependences on concentration and solvent are insignificant (Figures S16\u2013S23). When changing from toluene to methanol, the solvatochromic emission shift is almost less than 10 nm, and the emission profiles stay the same with increasing concentration.\nAll the complexes provide a more structured and narrower emission band in frozen glass at 77 K than in a fluid at RT (Figure S28).

According to the reported investigations on 5,6-membered bis(metallacyclic) Pt(II) complexes, not only the cyclometalated parent ligand (N\u02c6C*N\u2032 and N\u02c6N\u2032*C) and the auxiliary ligand (isocyanide and acetylide) could affect the emission of complexes but also the conjugation degree of the 5,6-membered bis(metallacycle) through the amino N atom exerts a considerable influence on the emission [8,19]. The emissive state of all complexes can be assigned to a ligand-centered (LC) triplet transition (3\u03c0,\u03c0) with some CT transitions [7\u20139,19]. The low energy emissions (578 and 595 nm) have more CT character than the high-energy ones (493 and 511 nm) [8,19]. For complexes (\u2212)-2 and (\u2212)-4, the geometric change to maximize conjugation of the 5,6-membered bis(metallacycle) through the amino N atom is unfavorable in the rigid matrix.

            "text": "Time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations have been performed to explore the origin of the transitions [27]. As revealed in Figure 5 and Table S3, the nature of S0\u2192S1 transition of all complexes mainly derive from HOMO (the highest occupied molecular orbital)\u2192LUMO (the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) with the overwhelming contribution of over 90%. Also, the S0\u2192S1 transition of complex (\u2212)-1 involves some composition of HOMO-1\u2192LUMO (7.0%). Based on molecular orbital (MO) patterns and orbital composition analysis (Figure 5 and Table S3), the HOMO of complexes (\u2212)-1 and (\u2212)-2 is mainly delocalized on Ring B, Ring C, and their bridging atom amino N with a total contribution of over 80%. Their LUMO concentrates on phenyl-pyridine or dipyridine moiety (Ring A and Ring B). In addition, the central Pt atom in (\u2212)-1 and (\u2212)-2 contributes little to HOMO and LUMO. For acetylide-coordinated Pt(II) complexes (\u2212)-3 and (\u2212)-4, the HOMO primarily comes from Pt nucleus and phenylacetylene with a total contribution of over 60%, and the fragments Ring B and Ring C also contribute some to the HOMO (Figure 5 and Table S3). Similar to the LUMO distribution of (\u2212)-1 and (\u2212)-2, the phenyl-pyridine or dipyridine moiety (Ring A and Ring B) gives a dominant contribution (>75%) to the LUMO of (\u2212)-3 and (\u2212)-4. Therefore, a mixture of 1ILCT (N\u02c6C*N\u2032 or N\u02c6N\u2032*C), 1MLCT (from Pt(II) atom to N\u02c6C*N\u2032 or N\u02c6N\u2032*C) and 1LLCT (from phenyl isocyanide or phenylacetylene to N\u02c6C*N\u2032 or N\u02c6N\u2032*C) transitions should be responsible for the lowest energy absorption band in the UV-vis spectra of all complexes. Furthermore, more 1MLCT and 1LLCT components are involved in acetylide-coordinated Pt(II) complexes (\u2212)-3 and (\u2212)-4, showing a calculated longer absorption wavelength than (\u2212)-1 and (\u2212)-2 with the same cyclometalated ligand (Table S3), which accords with the ones observed in the experiment (Figure 3).\nTo gain an insightful understanding of emission, natural transition orbital (NTO) analysis has been accomplished to examine the S0\u2192T1 excitation based on optimized T1 geometries (Figure 6 and Table S4) [19,28]. The hole (H) orbital of (\u2212)-1 is mainly resident in the phenyl-pyridine or dipyridine moiety (Ring A and Ring B), and the one of (\u2212)-2 is spread over the whole N\u02c6N\u2032*C ligand (amino N atom, Ring A, Ring B, and Ring C). For complexes (\u2212)-3 and (\u2212)-4, the central Pt atom holds a considerable distribution (18.16%\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6369 8 of 16\nand 11.07%) of the H orbital in addition to the contribution of the N\u02c6C*N\u2032 or N\u02c6N\u2032*C parent.

The absorbance at 424 nm of the DMSO-PBS and DMSO solutions of (\u2212)-2 decreases by ca. 30% and 10% at 37 \u25e6C over 5 days, respectively (Figures S29\u2013S34). However, the low energy absorptions of the DMSO-PBS solutions of other complexes dramatically decrease by 50\u201380%.\na positive control."

The cultured HeLa cells were inoculated in glass-bottom cell culture dishes. After overnight culture, the cells were stained with 10 \u00b5mol/L phosphorescent Pt complexes in a DMSO/DMEM mixture (5/95) for 15 min. After the removal of extracellular fluorescent dyes through washing with PBS buffer, the cell samples were imaged using confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscopy in blue, green, and red channels [38,39]. As shown in Figure 7, the chloride precursor Pt(N\u02c6C*N\u2032)Cl can efficiently permeate cells, showing bright blue luminescence and bright green emission, and the image in the red channel is not satisfactory enough.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6369 10 of 16\nOther luminescent Pt(II) complexes can also rapidly permeate cells. However, the image performances are inferior to Pt(N\u02c6C*N\u2032)Cl. It can be found that the luminescent Pt(II) complexes mainly distribute in cell membranes and are hard to stain the intracellular substances [38\u201340]. Complexes (\u2212)-1, (\u2212)-2, and (\u2212)-3 show excellent photostability in the DMSO/DMEM mixture (5/95) and can retain 97% of the emission intensity after 40 min irradiation (Figure S35) [41].

Their structures have been determined by NMR, HRMS, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Distorted square-planar coordination of the Pt(II) nucleus is observed for both isocyanideand acetylide-containing derivatives. The solution of all complexes is emissive in the greenyellow or orange regions, and acetylide-coordinated Pt(II) complexes show a lower energy emission than those isocyanide-coordinated ones with the same cyclometalated ligand (\u2206\u03bb = ca. 20 nm in the solution). Furthermore, the difference between cyclometalated N\u02c6N\u2032*C and N\u02c6C*N\u2032 ligands induces a more significant effect (\u2206\u03bb = ca. 80 nm in the solution) on the emission. The influence trend is also observed for the solid-state emission. The emissive state of all complexes can be attributed to a ligand-centered (LC) triplet transition (3\u03c0,\u03c0) with some CT transitions. Platinum(II) complex (\u2212)-2 coordinated with isocyanide displays high cytotoxicity against the above five human cancer lines K562, SGC7901, BEL-7402, A549, and HeLa. The existence of N\u02c6N\u2032*C 5,6-membered bis(metallacycle) may be important for high cytotoxicity. All the complexes can efficiently permeate cells, mainly distributing in cell membranes and showing a clear cell outline. This research provides a reference for developing biologically active 5,6-membered bis(metallacyclic) Pt(II) complexes.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6369 14 of 16\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28176369/s1.\nAuthor Contributions: J.J.: writing\u2014original draft, data curation, visualization.
