Introduction\nQuinolone derivatives are compounds used as a range of antibiotics [1,2]. Thus, a number of antibiotics have been developed based on them, such as levofloxacin [3,4], moxifloxacin [5], gemifloxacin [6,7], ciprofloxacin [8,9], and so on (Figure 1). Quinoline derivatives are also compounds used as antimalarial drugs, and chloroquine [10], quinine [11], and primaquine [12] have traditionally been used. In recent years, quinoline derivatives such as bosutinib [13], lenvatinib [14], and cabozantinib [15] have been employed clinically as anticancer agents (Figure 1). Hence, synthetic methods for a variety of quinolone and quinoline derivatives have been developed to date [16]. Azulene is one of the 10\u03c0-electron non-benzenoid aromatic hydrocarbons having a fused structure of five- and seven-membered rings. To elucidate the physicochemical properties, especially optical and electrochemical properties, a variety of synthetic methods have been developed for azulene-fused derivatives [17\u201323]. However, despite the fact that azulene derivatives fused by several heterocycles, such as pyridine [24], thiophene [25], pyrrole, and furan [26,27], have been reported, the preparation of quinoloneand quinoline-fused derivatives have not been conducted so far. Since anti-inflammatory and anti-ulcer properties have been revealed in azulene derivatives [28,29], the incorporation of a quinolone and quinoline framework could create compounds with unique chemical, physical, and pharmacological characteristics that are not present in the individual compounds, potentially leading to new pharmaceutical discoveries. In this context, we\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5785. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28155785 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5785 2 of 15\nsought to develop a new synthetic method for azulene-fused quinolones and quinolines, i.e., azuleno[2,1-b]quinolones and quinolines.\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 16\nFigure 1. Quinolone and quinoline derivatives in clinical use.\nAzulene is one of the 10\u03c0-electron non-benzenoid aromatic hydrocarbons having a\nfused structure of five- and seven-membered rings. To elucidate the physicochemical\nproperties, especially optical and electrochemical properties, a variety of synthetic meth-\nods have been developed for azulene-fused derivatives [17\u201323].

In this context, we sought\nto develop a new synthetic method for azulene-fused quinolones and quinolines, i.e., az-\nuleno[2,1-b]quinolones and quinolines.\nHerein, we describe a novel synthetic procedure for the synthesis of azuleno[2,1-\nb]quinolones via Br\u00f8nsted acid-catalyzed intramolecular cyclization of 1,3-diethoxycar-\nbonyl-2-arylaminoazulene derivatives. The azuleno[2,1-b]quinolones obtained were con-\nverted into azuleno[2,1-b]quinolines via halogenative aromatization with phosphoryl\nchloride (POCl3). The aromatic nucleophilic substitution reaction with several amines at\nthe chlorine substituent of a quinoline derivative was investigated, allowing the conver-\nsion to the corresponding 4-aminoquinolines.\n2. Results and Discussion\nThe acid-catalyzed intramolecular cyclization of diarylamine derivatives bearing es-\nter function represents a valuable strategy for the construction of quinolone frameworks\nvia Friedel\u2013Crafts-type reaction [30]. Hence, we decided to adopt this methodology for\nthe synthesis of azuleno[2,1-b]quinolones.\nInitially, we investigated the preparation of 2-arylaminoazulenes, which serve as the\nprecursors for azuleno[2,1-b]quinolones. In the synthesis of 2- and 6-aminoazulene deriv-\natives, the aromatic nucleophilic substitution (SNAr) reaction of haloazulenes with ali-\nphatic amines has already been reported by our group [31,32]. In the early years of azulene\nchemistry, Nozoe et al. reported that the SNAr reaction of diethyl 2-chloroazulene-1,3-di-\ncarboxylate (1) with aniline yields the corresponding substituted product 2a at a 59% yield\n[33]. However, there have been few reports on the SNAr reaction of haloazulenes with\naniline derivatives so far, except for an unsuccessful case [34]. In addition, since the reac-\ntion of 1 with aromatic amines with a function on the benzene ring has not been studied,\nwe investigated the synthesis of 2-arylaminoazulene derivatives via SNAr reaction with\nseveral aniline derivatives.\nThe yields and structures of the 2-arylaminoazulene derivatives obtained via SNAr\nreaction are summarized in Table 1. The SNAr reaction of 1 with anilines was examined by\nusing EtOH as a solvent. The yield of the product significantly depended on the substitu-\nent on the benzene ring of arylamines, as shown in Table 1. The SNAr reaction of 1 with\nFigure 1.

The yield of the product significantly depended on the substituent on the benzene ring of arylamines, as shown in Table 1. The SNAr reaction of 1 with aniline afforded 2-phenylaminoazulene derivative 2a at a 96% yield (entry 1). The melting point of 2a was consistent with the reported value. Moreover, even though the same reaction condition was employed, the extension of the reaction time (15 h) resulted in higher product yield compared to Nozoe\u2019s result. Similar to aniline, arylamines bearing electron-donating group on the benzene ring also reacted with 1 to produce the desired 2-aryl minoazulene derivatives 2a\u20132e in excellent yi lds (89\u201396%, entries 2\u20135). In these cas s, pure p oducts could be obtained via sim le filtration protocols because the products were precipitated by cooling the reaction mixture, whereas the reaction with arylamine derivatives substituted with an electron-withdrawing group and sterically bulky 1-naphthylamine resulted in lower product yields (2f: 72% and 2g: 61%; entries 6 and 8). In the SNAr reaction with\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5785 3 of 15\np-nitroaniline, no reaction was observed even under the reflux temperature conditions in N-methylpyrolidone (NMP), which was attributed to the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group (entry 7). The reaction with N-methylaniline afforded the desired product 2h, but with a low yield (33%), which was probably due to the steric hindrance of the methyl group on the amine moiety (entry 9).\nTable 1.

Halogen substituents hol significant importance as functional groups in modern organic synthesis because they can be transformed into a diverse range of substituents through cross-coupling and nucleophilic substitution reactions [35\u201337]. Regarding the halogenation of aromatic compounds, electrophilic substitution reactions with halogens in the presence of Lewis or Br\u00f8nsted acids can be utilized, or N-halosuccinimide (NXS) is also frequently employed for electron-rich aromatic rings. However, the introduction of halogen substituents through the electrophilic substitution reactions in electron-deficient nitrogencontaining aromatic compounds, such as pyridine and quinoline derivatives, is often difficult due to their inherently low reactivity. Therefore, we undertook an investigation into the conversion of quinolone derivatives into azulene-fused quinolines with a halogen substituent via halogenated aromatization.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5785 6 of 15Molecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 16\nH N\nEtO\nCO2Et\nOH\nEtO2C H N\nEtO OH H\nB\nH+\nEtO2C H N\nH+\nH+ H N\nH+\nEtO2C H N\nR\nR\nR EtO O\nH\nH N\nR\nR\nR\nA\nEtO OH CD\nH\nD'\nEtO2C\nEtO2C\n2\n3\nH+\nCO2\nEt O OH2\nO E\nScheme 1.

Therefore, we undertook an investi-\ngation into the conversion of quinolone derivatives into azulene-fused quinolines with a\nhalogen substituent via halogenated aromatization.\nThe conversion of quinolone derivatives into azulene-fused quinolines was effec-\ntively accomplished through the reaction with phosphoryl chloride (POCl3). The struc-\ntures and yields of the resultant products are represented in Table 3. Since the solubility\nof the quinolone derivatives was relatively high, POCl3 was employed as both solvent and\nreagent in this reaction. The reaction of 3a with POCl3, conducted at reflux temperature,\nyielded the desired compound 4a as the sole product with a 89% yield (entry 1).

However, the separation\nof the resulting mixture proved difficult via chromatography or recrystallization. Quino-\nlone 3f, possessing an iodine substituent, produced 4f along with trace amounts of 4a;\nthus, the product yield of 4f was only 61% due to the competing decomposition reaction\n(entry 6). Furthermore, quinolone 3g with an extended conjugated system exhibited reac-\ntivity with POCl3 to afford 4g at an 80% yield (entry 7).\nIn contrast to the rather low solubility of quinolones 3a\u20133g in common organic sol-\nvents, quinolines 4a\u20134g showed high solubility. These differences are probably due to\nintermolecular hydrogen bonds between the NH protons and the carbonyl groups, which\ncauses 3a\u20133g to exist as multimers in the solid state, resulting in low solubility, whereas\nthe high solubility of 4a\u20134g is a ributable to the absence of such interactions.\nScheme 1.

Conclusions\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated herein a procedure for the synthesis of azuleno [2,1-b]quinolones and quinolines from 2-arylaminoazulene derivatives, which are prepared via the SNAr reaction of 2-chloroazulenes with arylamines. The synthesis of azuleno [2,1-b]quinolones was successfully accomplished through the intramolecular cyclization of 2-arylaminoazulene derivatives bearing ester groups, employing PPA as a Br\u00f8nsted acid catalyst. Furthermore, halogenative aromatization of the corresponding azuleno [2,1- b]quinolones with POCl3 afforded azuleno [2,1-b]quinolines with a chlorine substituent. Additionally, the SNAr reaction of azuleno [2,1-b]quinolines with several secondary amines was also investigated. Consequently, the reactions proceeded expeditiously under the low-temperature conditions, yielding the respective aminoquinoline derivatives, except for the reaction with diethylamine. As discussed in the Introduction section, quinolones and quinolines possess considerable potential in the fields of pharmaceuticals and medicinal chemistry. Therefore, the exploration of additional avenues to functionalize these derivatives may lead to practical pharmaceutical agents. The development of an additional synthetic methodology for azuleno [2,1-d]quinolones and quinolines is currently underway in our laboratory.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28155785/s1, Figures: 1H and 13C NMR spectra of new compounds.\nAuthor Contributions: Methodology, T.S.; analysis, T.S., M.T., M.U., Y.A., A.Y., R.S. and S.I.; investigation, T.S., M.T., M.U., Y.A., A.Y., R.S. and S.I.; writing, original draft preparation, T.S.; writing, review and editing, T.S., M.T., M.U., Y.A., A.Y., R.S. and S.I.
