    "abstractText": "Gravitational-wave parameter estimation for compact binary signals typically relies on sequential estimation of the properties of the detector Gaussian noise and of the binary parameters. This procedure assumes that the noise variance, expressed through its power spectral density, is perfectly known in advance. We assess the impact of this approximation on the estimated parameters by means of an analysis that simultaneously estimates the noise and compact binary parameters, thus allowing us to marginalize over uncertainty in the noise properties. We compare the traditional sequential estimation method and the new full marginalization method using events from the GWTC-3 catalog. We find that the recovered signals and inferred parameters agree to within their statistical measurement uncertainty. At current detector sensitivities, uncertainty about the noise power spectral density is a subdominant effect compared to other sources of uncertainty.",

This procedure assumes that the noise variance, expressed through its power spectral density, is perfectly known in advance. We assess the impact of this approximation on the estimated parameters by means of an analysis that simultaneously estimates the noise and compact binary parameters, thus allowing us to marginalize over uncertainty in the noise properties. We compare the traditional sequential estimation method and the new full marginalization method using events from the GWTC-3 catalog. We find that the recovered signals and inferred parameters agree to within their statistical measurement uncertainty. At current detector sensitivities, uncertainty about the noise power spectral density is a subdominant effect compared to other sources of uncertainty.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nEstimating the source properties of compact binary coalescences (CBC) using data from gravitational-wave (GW) observatories [1, 2] relies on accurate models of both the astrophysical signal and the noise in the detector. While the signal model employs waveform templates that are based on analytic approximations to Einstein\u2019s field equations, the noise model typically takes the form of the power spectral density (PSD) of the detector Gaussian noise, Sn(f) [3]. Given GW data d = h+n that are a sum of a coherent signal h between detectors and uncorrelated random noise n, and an accurate signal model h\u2032, the residual r = d\u2212h\u2032 should follow the same distribution as the noise. Assuming Gaussian and stationary noise, the likelihood function L(d|h\u2032) in the frequency domain is [4, 5]\nL(d|h\u2032) = \u220f i\n2\n\u03c0TSn(fi) exp\n[ \u22122 |r\u0303i| 2\nTSn(fi)\n] , (1)\nwhich explicitly depends on Sn(f); T is the duration of the data analyzed and i counts frequency bins.\nThe likelihood of Eq. (1), and thus analyses of GW signals, depend on multiple formal assumptions about the detector noise and its PSD. Parameter estimation [6\u2013 8] assumes that the noise is Gaussian and stationary in time, though mitigation techniques and methods to relax these assumptions have been explored [9\u201313]. Furthermore, the PSD is typically a required input for CBC parameter estimation. Using a point estimate for Sn(f) assumes the noise PSD is perfectly known or at least that is it estimated to precision far greater than other statistical uncertainties. The noise PSD must be estimated from the data [3], typically in one of two ways.\n\u2217 cplunkett23@amherst.edu\nThe first, termed the \u201coff-source\u201d method, relies on the median PSD of many data segments around, but not including, the data segment containing the signal [6]. This calculation requires the stationarity assumption to hold over the entire stretch of data used to estimate the PSD, typically O(103s) [6, 14]. The second, termed the \u201consource\u201d method, uses only the data segment containing the signal.\nThe \u201con-source\u201d method relies on BayesLine [15], integrated into the broader BayesWave algorithm [12, 16], and models the PSD with a two-component phenomenological fit. A cubic spline describes the broadband noise behavior, while narrow-band spectral features are fit using Lorentzians. The number and parameters of the spline points and Lorentzians are marginalized over with a trans-dimensional Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm [17], also known as a reversible-jump MCMC (RJMCMC). Any non-Gaussian components of the data (namely, instrumental glitches or astrophysical signals) are modeled with sine-Gaussian wavelets, thus relaxing the assumption that the noise is Gaussian during PSD estimation. By using the same data segment for both PSD and signal parameter estimation, the on-source method additionally restricts the stationarity assumption to a shorter data segment, typically O(4s). A point estimate from the PSD posterior, typically a fair draw or the median, is then selected and passed on for downstream analyses. The on-source and off-source methods were compared in [18] where it was demonstrated that the former results in PSDs that are more consistent with the Gaussian likelihood assumptions. Both methods, however, still provide a single point-estimate for the PSD.\nTraditional parameter estimation [19\u201321] involves sequential estimation of the noise PSD and the binary parameters. Once a point-estimate for the noise PSD has been provided with either the on-source or the off-source methods, LALInference [6], Bilby [7, 8], or other similar pipelines marginalize over the binary parameters using waveform templates as the signal model. During this two-\nar X\niv :2\n20 8.\n02 29\n1v 2\n[ gr\n-q c]\n1 0\nN ov\n2 02\n2\n2 step sequential process, care must be taken to ensure that the spectral resolution and maximum and minimum frequencies of the estimated PSD match the desired parameter estimation analysis settings. Besides these technical complications, the sequential process assumes that the PSD is perfectly estimated with negligible uncertainty, or at least that any uncertainty is not correlated with the binary parameters.\nAssessing the impact of the assumption that the noise PSD is perfectly known requires marginalizing over noise uncertainty during parameter estimation. The choice of PSD estimation method and PSD prior results in different functional forms for the marginalized CBC likelihood [15, 22\u201329]. Ro\u0308ver et al. [22] showed that assuming a PSD prior that is an inverse \u03c72-distribution allows one to analytically marginalize over PSD uncertainty and converts the standard Whittle likelihood to a Student-t distribution. Talbot and Thrane [29] extended [22] and computed the marginalized likelihood for both the mean and median off-source PSD. Finally, Biscoveanu et al. [28] explored a method of incorporating PSD uncertainty in CBC parameter estimation by considering the full PSD posterior from BayesLine rather than a point-estimate. They still analyzed the data sequentially, but used 200 fair draws from the PSD posterior to perform 200 parameter estimation analyses and combined the resulting posteriors. Besides the computational cost, one drawback of this method is that it ignores potential correlations between the PSD and the CBC parameter posterior.\nBoth Biscoveanu et al. [28] and Talbot and Thrane [29] concluded that PSD uncertainty is likely a subdominant effect compared to typical current statistical uncertainties given their respective PSD and binary parameter estimation methods. Biscoveanu et al. [28] found posteriors under the median and marginalized on-source PSD that agree in position and width to within a few percent, which they determine is an order of magnitude higher than expected due to statistical fluctuations. Among the GWTC-1 events [19], GW151012 [30] displays the largest effect due to uncertainty on the LIGO Hanford PSD. However, the choice of PSD estimation method, specifically the off-source mean or median studied in [29], had a greater impact on the inferred parameter posterior than PSD marginalization. Similar conclusions were reached in [31] in the context of the impact of PSD misestimation on inferring the tidal deformability of neutron star binaries. The impact of marginalization could be more significant when precise calculations of Bayesian evidence are needed [29].\nIn this study we revisit the issue of uncertainty in the PSD estimation and its effect on the inferred CBC parameters on events from GWTC-3 [21]. We take advantage of recent developments on the BayesWave algorithm1 that augment its list of models with a CBC model that\n1 From now on we use the term BayesWave to describe the combined BayesLine and BayesWave algorithms.\ndescribes the signal with waveform templates [10, 32]. This allows us to simultaneously model the noise PSD and the GW signal from the same on-source data, thus obtaining CBC parameter posteriors that are marginalized over noise uncertainty. Compared to the approach of [28], our method allows us to obtain a joint posterior for the noise and the signal rather than assume the signal and noise posteriors are uncorrelated and obtained by sequential analysis of the same data.\nWe apply our analysis to binary black hole (BBH) signals from GWTC-3 [21]. To reduce computational cost, we restrict to confident detections with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) > 10. We further discard signals with analysis segments > 16 seconds and events with technical complications of different lower frequency cutoffs in different detectors, for a total sample of 50 events. We analyze each event with two methods. The sequential method follows the procedure employed for parameter estimation in [21] by first estimating the median for the on-source noise PSD and then using this point estimate to sample from the posterior of the CBC source parameters. The marginalized method samples from the joint posterior of the noise PSD and CBC source parameters. We compare the resulting source parameter posteriors and find broad agreement between the two methods. In particular, over all events the marginalized method results in an average change of 0.0+1.4\u22121.6% in the marginalized chirp mass posterior median and a decrease of 2+16\u221213% in the marginalized posterior 90% width. Neither are statistically distinguishable from zero. In addition, we find no significant trend between the change in posterior width and the posterior median or signal SNR. Finally, we devise a simple toy model to demonstrate how a broadband increase or reduction in the noise PSD results in a higher-order, and thus subdominant, effect in the CBC parameter posteriors.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we describe the BayesWave algorithm and models for the GW signal available within it. In Sec. III, we discuss our analyses on a set of events from GWTC-3 [21], considering the waveform reconstructions as well as the parameter posteriors. We use a toy model of a shifted PSD to help explain the minimal impact of PSD marginalization on parameter posteriors in Sec. IV. Finally, in Sec. V we conclude."

BayesWave simultaneously models GW signals, detector noise, and glitches using different models. We provide a glossary of terms in Table I, a schematic algorithm workflow in Fig. 1, and further describe each model below.\n\u2022 The noise model uses the BayesLine algorithm,\nfully integrated into BayesWave, to model the PSD Sn(f) as a sum of a broadband spline and Lorentzians for spectral lines [15]. The number and parameters of the spline control points and Lorentzians are marginalized over with an RJMCMC. In the workflow of Fig. 1, the noise RJMCMC is depicted with a blue box.\n\u2022 The CBC model uses waveform templates derived within general relativity to model a CBC signal. The CBC sampler and its integration within BayesWave are described in detail in [32]. For this work, we use the IMRPhenomD [35, 36] waveform model with identical settings and priors as [32]. The CBC likelihood is computed with the heterodyning method to reduce the computational cost [37, 38]. In the workflow of Fig. 1, the CBC model parameters are split between the extrinsic MCMC that handles parameters \u03b8ext (purple box) and the CBC MCMC that handles parameters \u03b8cbc\n(pink box); see [32] for details.\n\u2022 The glitch model targets any incoherent nonGaussian noise in the detectors by modeling such noise with a sum of sine-Gaussian wavelets. The number and morphology of the wavelets are not fixed a priori but instead marginalized over with an RJMCMC. This model is typically used to target instrumental glitches, but can capture any excess power that is unaccounted for, including signals.

The signal model targets astrophysical signals by modeling coherent power between the detectors through a sum of sine-Gaussian wavelets. The number and morphology of the wavelets are again marginalized over with an RJMCMC. The signal model is very similar to the glitch model, only the wavelets are coherent rather than incoherent across the detector network.\n4 fixed. Each independent sampler proceeds for a given number of iterations, before returning the last set of parameters and switching to the next sampler. This procedure provides an efficient way of approximating the joint distribution of all parameters, provided that the parameters across blocks are not too correlated. The breakdown of parameters within blocks is described in [32], while [11] shows that this procedure converges even when the parameters across blocks are correlated.\nBayesWave can be used with any combination of these models, resulting in different analysis modes as shown in Table I. The \u201ccleaning phase\u201d is the standard BayesWave mode used to compute median PSDs for analyses that use a point-estimate for the PSD. Data in each detector are analyzed separately with the noise model and the glitch model. The former targets the noise PSD, while the latter targets any excess non-Gaussian power (glitch or GW signal) to ensure that its presence does not affect PSD estimation. A posterior for the noise (and the excess power) is returned from which a median can be computed for further parameter estimation analyses such as [19\u201321]. During the \u201cCBC+noise\u201d analysis mode, data from all detectors are analyzed simultaneously. The GW signal is modeled with the CBC model while the noise PSD in each detector is modeled with the noise model and thus fully marginalized over. For comparison to the standard analysis of [19\u201321], we also use the \u201cCBC+fixed\u201d analysis mode where again the GW signal is modeled with the CBC model, but now the noise PSD is fixed, typically acquired from a previous \u201cCleaning Phase\u201d analysis."

This\nsummary statistic describes the similarity of two distributions and ranges from 0 for identical distributions to 1 for dissimilar distributions. In Fig. 5, we show the JSD for the marginalized M, \u03c7eff , DL, and q posteriors as a function of the network matched-filter SNR as reported\nin GWOSC [33, 34]. The average JSD is 0.006 across all events and parameters and the JSD is smaller than 0.05 for all except one, indicating overall agreement between the methods [19]. The largest JSD is 0.052, for the chirp mass of GW190512 180714. The magnitude arises from\na sizeable posterior width discrepancy, which is further discussed below and is shown in Appendix A to depend on the analysis low frequency cutoff. Overall, the difference between the marginalized and sequential posteriors is below the difference in posteriors induced by choice of waveform model [19]. In addition, the JSD shows minimal trend with SNR with the exception of a slight trend of increasing chirp mass JSD with SNR. However, the underdensity of events at high SNR makes it premature to confirm a relation.\nFurther, we examine the chirp mass posterior width in Fig. 6, where we plot the relative difference between the two methods as a function of the posterior median (i.e., the event chirp mass) and the SNR. We find no significant trends between these parameters, concluding that the effect of marginalizing over PSD uncertainty does not depend on the chirp mass or signal strength. Indeed, a linear fit of the data of Fig. 6 returns a slope consistent with zero. The biggest outlier is GW190512 180714, for which we obtain a \u223c 40% decrease in posterior width using the marginalized PSD.

            "text": "The results of Sec. II B suggest that the sequential noise estimation method results in CBC parameter posteriors that are qualitatively similar to the marginalized method. The main difference between the two is that the former uses the median of the PSD posterior, while the latter uses the full posterior. To further explore the difference between the two, we consider what happens if we instead had selected the upper or lower 90% estimate of the PSD with the sequential method. A larger noise PSD should lead to underestimation of the signal SNR, and as a consequence, overestimation of the posterior uncertainty. Similarly, a lower PSD should lead in more narrow posteriors. In effect, we expect a correlation between the noise posterior height and the CBC parameter posterior width.\nTo explore this behavior in the data, we revisit the \u201cCBC+fixed\u201d analysis for GW159014 using not only the median PSD, but also the lower and upper 90% credible\n7 \u22120 .3 0 \u22120 .1 5 0. 00 0. 15 \u03c7 eff\n15 0\n30 0\n45 0\n60 0\nD L [M\np c]\n28 .5 30 .0 31 .5 33 .0\nM[M ]\n0. 60\n0. 75\n0. 90\nq\n\u22120 .3 0 \u22120 .1 5 0. 00 0. 15\n\u03c7eff\n15 0 30 0 45 0 60 0 DL[Mpc] 0. 60 0. 75 0. 90 q\nSequential Marginalized\nFIG. 3.

The methods give consistent results to within the statistical uncertainty.\ninterval PSDs. The chirp mass posterior for each analysis is plotted in the top panel of Fig. 7; they show the expected posterior broadening and narrowing but also a small shift in the posterior median. The bottom panel of Fig. 7 shows the width of the 90% credible interval forM as a function of the height of the amplitude spectral density (i.e., the square root of the PSD that is proportional to the SNR and thus the posterior width), given as fractional difference to the median at 100 Hz. Though with three points it is premature to conclude that the trend is linear, it is still evident that the uncertainty increases as the PSD increases (and the SNR decreases). In the case of GW159014, we also find an increase in the posterior median with decreased PSD height. However, tests on other events confirm the trend of the bottom panel of Fig. 7 regarding the posterior width, but no trend regarding the median. This suggests that the median shift is not a generic feature and further confirms the expected correlation between the posteriors.\nWe further explore a toy model to illuminate this behavior. When marginalizing over PSD uncertainty, each step in the CBC MCMC uses a different PSD that is drawn from the PSD posterior. Overall, the sampler therefore uses a range of PSDs that can be either higher or lower than the median, and thus the CBC posterior width of each sample will be either increased or decreased compared to the median. As a result, the CBC posterior\nthat results from marginalizing over PSD parameters will be a collection of samples from posteriors with different standard deviations. Simplifying to the case of a Gaussian posterior, this effect is comparable to a normal distribution integrated over a range of standard deviations. The difference between the posteriors from using a fixed median PSD (the sequential method) versus the full PSD posterior (the marginalized method) can then be approximated by the difference between a normal distribution and one integrated over a range of standard deviations,\n\u03b4(\u03b8) \u2261 1 2\u03b5 \u222b \u03b5 \u2212\u03b5 N ( \u03b8|\u00b5, (1 + x)\u03c3 ) dx\u2212N (\u03b8|\u00b5, \u03c3) , (4)\nwhere \u03b8 is the parameter of interest, \u00b5 is the mean of the posterior, \u03c3 is the standard deviation when using the median PSD, and \u03b5 encodes the relative PSD uncertainty. Here we choose \u03b5 symmetric about \u03c3, which arises from the expectation (and observation, as shown in Fig. 7) that if the ASD uncertainty is Gaussian and thus symmetric about the median, then the resulting range of posterior widths will also be roughly symmetric. Figure 8 shows \u03b4(\u03b8) for \u00b5 = 0, \u03c3 = 1, and several values of \u03b5. A Taylor expansion around \u03b5 = 0 shows that the difference between the two distributions peaks at their mean and goes as \u03b4(\u03b8) \u223c \u03b52. This scaling suggests that a small PSD uncertainty (and thus a small \u03b5) results in a suppressed effect in the parameter posteriors as it is a higher order effect. Indeed as shown in Fig. 7, the typical PSD uncertainty at current sensitivities is \u03b5 \u223c 0.05, which is much smaller than the typical width of the posteriors."

            "text": "In this study, we assessed the impact of assuming a known and fixed PSD during parameter estimation for CBCs. We compared two methods, a sequential method that first computes the PSD posterior and then uses the median to estimate the posterior for the CBC parameters, and a marginalized method that simultaneously infers the posterior for the PSD and the CBC parameters. We recovered similar parameter posteriors, in agreement with previous results [28, 29]. In particular, the difference in the chirp mass posterior median (width) between the two methods is 0+1.4\u22121.6% (2 +16 \u221213%) across all events. We found no trends between these differences and the event chirp masses and network SNRs. The marginalized method involves simultaneous modeling of more parameters and thus comes with a greater computational cost than the sequential method. This increase is smaller for high-mass events, but can reach an increase of up to\u223c 1.5 in computing time for low-mass events.\nThe simultaneous modeling of the CBC signal and the noise PSD allows us to marginalize over uncertainty in the latter. Compared to the method explore in [28], our method involves a single parameter estimation analysis and can account for potential correlations between the\n9 10\u22123 10\u22122 M[M ] \u03c7eff\n10 15 20 25\n10\u22123\n10\u22122\nDL[Mpc]\n10 15 20 25\nq\nNetwork SNR\nJ S\nD iv\ner ge\nn ce\nFIG. 5.

Additionally, our method enables estimation of the Bayesian evidence for the marginalized PSD analysis and thus computation of the Bayes factor between different models. However, correctly interpreting the Bayes factor within the context of the chosen priors of the PSD model is a nontrivial task and lies outside the scope of this paper.\nWe explained our results within the context of a toy model that considers the impact of a systematic increase or decrease of the PSD. In the case of simple Gaussian distributions, the difference between the posterior from the median PSD and the one from the full PSD posterior is of higher order in the PSD uncertainty.

Bottom: fractional difference between the 90% credible interval widths of the chirp mass posteriors from the top panel against the fractional difference between amplitude spectral density and the median at 100 Hz.\nthe sequential method that is based on the median PSD already results in posteriors that are very similar to the marginalized method. We conclude that at current detector sensitivities, PSD uncertainty is subdominant compared to other sources of uncertainty, especially when the median on-source PSD is used."

            "text": "We revisit the two events with the largest differences in parameter posteriors between the marginalized and sequential method, GW190512 180714 and GW190513 205428. In the analyses with the standard settings presented in Sec. III B, we found fractional differences in the chirp mass 90% posterior width of 38.1% and 24.9%, respectively. Among the various parameter settings, reducing the lower frequency cutoff from flow = 20 Hz to flow = 16 Hz significantly mitigates the observed differences. We compare the different M posteriors for GW190512 180714 and GW190513 205428 in Fig. 9. Using flow = 16 Hz reduces the posterior width differences to -7.1% and 11.3%, respectively. Similarly, the JSDs are reduced from 0.052 and 0.033 to 0.0025 and 0.015 for each event, respectively. This follow-up analysis confirms that the differences between the posteriors of these events goes down with smaller lower frequency cutoffs, and suggests that analysis settings can sometimes significantly influence parameter estimation results.\n[1] J.
