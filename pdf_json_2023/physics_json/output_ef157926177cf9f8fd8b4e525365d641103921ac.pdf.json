    "abstractText": "Post-translational modifications ( PTMs ) of histones ha v e fundamental effects on chromatin str uct ure and function. While the impact of PTMs on the function of core histones are increasingly well understood, this is much less the case for modifications of linker histone H1, which is at least in part due to a lack of proper tools. In this w ork, w e establish the assembly of intact chromatosomes containing site-specifically ubiquitylated and acetylated linker histone H1.2 variants obtained by a combination of chemical biology approaches. We then use these comple x es in a tailored affinity enrichment mass spectrometry w orkflo w to identify and comprehensively characterize chromatosome-specific cellular interactomes and the impact of site-specific linker histone modifications on a proteome-wide scale. We validate and benchmark our approach by western-blotting and by confirming the involvement of chromatin-bound H1.2 in the recruitment of proteins involved in DNA double-strand break repair using an in vitro ligation assay. We relate our data to previous work and in particular compare it to data on modification-specific interaction partners of free H1. Taken together, our data supports the role of chromatin-bound H1 as a regulatory protein with distinct functions beyond DNA compaction and constitutes an important resource for future in v estigations of histone epigenetic modifications.

Chromatin components or parts thereof, like histone peptides, histone proteins, or recombinantly prepared nucleosomes, carrying defined modifications introduced by chemical biology approaches, have already been used successfully as bait molecules in AE-MS experiments ( 10\u201318 ) . Yet, investigations on the function of histone PTMs have been largely focused on core histone PTMs, while only recently insights into the interactomes of site-specifically modified H1 variants on their own were obtained ( 14 ,15 ) .\nTo elucidate the specific influence of PTMs on chromatin, complex structures that closely resemble native chromatin are preferable bait molecules, since only they allow multivalent interactions that likely occur on chromatin ( 19 ,20 ) . We assembled intact chromatosome variants by combination of different site-specifically modified linker histone variants generated by bioorthogonal chemistry with recombinantly expressed core histones and nucleosomal DNA that carried an affinity tag. Their application as baits in AE-MS experiments allows for the first time a direct comparison of nucleosomeand chromatosome specific interaction partners as well as obtaining insights into the effect of site-specific PTMs on histone H1.2.\nOur data reveals modification-dependent interaction partners of chromatin-bound H1.2 and provides evidence for a role of chromatin-associated H1.2 in the recruitment of proteins involved in DNA double-strand break repair. Overall, it supports the role of H1.2 as a regulating protein with distinct functions beyond DNA compaction and constitutes an important resource for future investigations of histone epigenetic modifications."

The optimal ratio of core histone octamer o DTB-labeled nucleosomal DNA ensuring complete converion of all DNA into nucleosomes was determined in small cale titrations and kept constant for all following experients. DTB-DNA (1.0 eq.) was supplemented with a cometitor DNA (crDNA; 0.005 eq.; empty pUC-18 vector), BSA 3.85 eq.; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and histone octamer as deermined previously. Dialysis in 3500 MWCO tubing (Thermo isher Scientific) was started at 4 \u25e6C in high salt buffer (10 mM ris\u2013HCl, pH 7.5, 2 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet -40 substitute (v / v), 1 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol) and the salt oncentration was lowered to a final concentration of 50 mM aCl over the course of 20 hrs by stepwise addition of low alt buffer (same as high salt buffer, but only 50 mM NaCl). ll nucleosome assemblies were monitored by 7.5% native AGE in 0.5x TBE buffer and visualization of DNA by UV rradiation after ethidium bromide staining.\nNucleosome concentrations were determined by measuring NA concentration by measuring the absorption at 260 nm sing NanoDrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

H1.2 exhibits a tripartite structure, which is shared with other linker histone variants, composed of a central globular domain flanked by N- and C-terminal tails (Figure 1 A). Lysine 17 in the Nterminal tail and lysine 64 in the globular domain of H1.2 were previously found to be both ubiquitylated and acetylated in cells ( 5 , 6 , 14 , 15 , 39 , 40 ). We therefore generated versions of H1 that were either acetylated or ubiquitylated on lysine 17 or 64, resulting in 4 differently modified variants in addition to unmodified H1.2 (Figure 1 B, Supplementary Figure S1 ) ( 14 ,15 ). Ubiquitylation was achieved by conjugation of azidemodified ubiquitin with alkyne-containing H1.2 by coppercatalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC, click reaction) with near quantitative conversion (Figure 1 D). The site-specific introduction of an alkyne moiety in H1.2 was achieved by incorporation of the unnatural amino acid Plk,\nFigure 1.

Ubiquitin containing a C-terminal azide moiety was prepared by introduction of azidohomoalanine (Aha) through selective pressure incorporation (SPI) to give UbG76Aha ( 29 ). The 1,4-substituted triazole linkage resulting from CuAAC between H1.2KxPlk and UbG76Aha (Figure 1 D) is a bioorthogonal alternative to the natural isopeptide bond between the C-terminal carboxy group of ubiquitin and the \u03b5 -amino group of a target protein\u2019s lysine while retaining similar electronic properties (Figure 1 C) ( 41 ). Acetylated H1.2 was prepared by the site-specific incorporation of N \u03b5 -acetyl-lysine through SCS at position 17 or 64 of H1.2 successfully yielding H1.2KxAc ( x = 17, 64; Figure 1 E) ( 14 ). All H1.2 variants were purified using a C-terminal His 6 tag, ensuring purification of full-length expression products.\nTo investigate the influence of a specific PTMs of H1.2 on PPIs in the context of the chromatosome, the assembled chromatosomes used as baits needed to be as homogeneous as possible. Thus, human core histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 were expressed and purified from E. coli (Figure 2 A, Supplementary Figure S2A, S2D ) and used to assemble the octamer (Figure 2 B, Supplementary Figure S2B, C )\n( 21 ,22 ). The nucleosomal DNA was generated by PCR and was equipped with a desthiobiotin (DTB) affinity tag introduced via a 5 \u2032 -modified primer during PCR amplification (Figure 2 A, 2 C). Nucleosomes were assembled by combining the DNA with the core histone octamer in high salt buffer, followed by stepwise dialysis to low salt buffer (Figure 2 D, Supplementary Figure S3A ) ( 21 ). Nucleosome assembly was monitored with native PAGE, indicating successful and quantitative assembly . Finally , chromatosomes were quantitatively assembled by adding H1.2 variants to the previously assembled nucleosomes (Figure 2 E, Supplementary Figure S3B ). Interestingly, we observed that the chromatosome migrated faster than the nucleosome in native PAGE, although its larger size would suggest the opposite (Figure 2 E) ( 14 ). This is likely due to the nucleosomal DNA that contains an additional 30 bp of linker DNA on either side of the central 147 bp that span around the octamer. This results in the formation of a very compact chromatosome structure and thus faster migration in native PAGE and the same migration behavior has been observed previously when nucleosomal DNA of comparable length was used ( 42 ). When ubiquitylated H1.2 was added to nucleosomes, this migration behavior was partially reversed, likely due to the additional protein mass of ubiquitin (Figure 2 E).\nFigure 2.

( A ) Schematic overview of affinit y-t agged chromatosome assembly using site-specifically modified H1.2 variants from building blocks. Core histones were expressed in E. coli and assembled into the histone octamer. A desthiobiotin affinity tag was introduced into the nucleosomal DNA by 5 \u2032 -primer modification used in PCR amplification of nucleosomal DNA. Nucleosomes were subsequently assembled by mixing of core histone octamers and desthiobiotin-labeled DNA with a nucleosome positioning sequence.

Chromatosomes were first immobilized on streptavidinoupled beads to allow removal of any unbound material nd residuals from prior assembly procedures by washing. o verify that chromatosome stability was maintained durng the procedure, chromatosomes immobilized on beads ere incubated with HEK 293T lysate simulating an affinty enrichment experiment.

The affinity enrichment of interacting proteins was caried out as shown in Figure 3 A, using biological triplicates or all our seven samples: chromatosomes containing unodified H1.2 or H1.2K17Ub, H1.2K64Ub, H1.2K17Ac or 1.2K64Ac variants, as well as nucleosomes and empty beads\ns control. Enriched proteins were identified and quantified sing a label-free data independent acquisition (DIA) MS orkflow with variable window size. This procedure was op-\nimized for our approach ( Supplementary Table S3 ) allowing s to reliably quantify approximately 1500 proteins across ll bait samples ( Supplementary Figure S4A ). Evaluation of he data with principal component analysis (PCA) indicated arge differences between samples and the empty bead conrol, in comparison to minimal variability in-between baits\n( Supplementary Figure S4B ). Since these differences prohibited direct evaluation of significant differences between baits, all proteins that were significantly enriched for any of the bait samples were first determined through ANOVA, resulting in 728 proteins ( S 0 = 0.1, FDR = 0.05; Supplementary Figure S4C ). Significant enrichment for a specific chromatosome variant was in a next step then determined by pairwise comparison to the nucleosome sample, resulting in 119 significantly enriched proteins ( S 0 = 0.1, FDR = 0.05, t -test; Supplementary Figure S5 ). These could then be further divided into two main groups: a nucleosome-enriched cluster of 49 proteins and a chromatosome-enriched cluster of 70 proteins (Figure 3 B).\nOverall, the associated protein classes, as obtained by PANTHER ( 35 ) were as expected for chromatin interacting proteins, thus validating our tailored affinity enrichment approach (Figure 3 C). We find that within the nucleosomeenriched cluster, a high number of proteins were associated with RNA metabolism, which is due to the presence of 8 subunits of DNA-dependent RNA polymerases I to III and 5 subunits of the exosome complex in this cluster. Enrichment of RNA polymerase subunits only in the absence of H1.2 is in agreement with previous findings of inhibitory effects of H1.2 on transcription ( 43 ). The presence of the exosome complex is consistent with the enrichment of RNA polymerases, as the complex is a known RNA processing factor.\nBesides inhibitory effects of H1.2 on transcription also an activating role has been observed ( 7 ) which is reflected in our data by the chromatosome-specific enrichment of pro-\nFigure 3.

Not surprisingly, half of the chromatosome-enriched transcriptional regulators were annotated to contain at least one zinc finger domain. Based on this observation, all proteins were further evaluated and 16 out of 70 proteins within the chromatosome-enriched cluster contained a zinc finger domain, compared to only 4 out of 49\nfor the nucleosome-enriched cluster. Since all affinity enrichment samples contained the same DNA sequence, this finding hints at an epigenetic role of zinc finger proteins that does not solely depend on their DNA binding capabilities and may encompass H1.2 binding. Apart from transcription-related proteins, DNA-replication associated proteins such as 3 subunits of replicative MCM helicase or topoisomerases II alpha and beta were enriched for chromatosomes, also supporting the view of H1.2 as regulator beyond chromatin compaction.\nMost proteins within the chromatosome-enriched cluster were preferentially binding to unmodified H1.2, but over 40% of the proteins were enriched either additionally or solely for\nFigure 4.

No unique enrichment was observed for chroatosomes containing acetylated H1.2, which could be exlained by the need for the presence of additional epigenetic arks for cellular effects of H1.2 acetylation. Ubiquitylaion of H1.2 on the other hand had a more distinct impact n the chromatosome interactome. In total, besides ubiquiin we have identified six ubiquitylation-specific interactors SERF2, VPS25, DCUND1D1, BARD1, MTA1 and USP16 Supplementary Figure S4D ).\nTo the best of our knowledge, up to now an interaction with ubiquitylated H1 has not been established for any of these proteins. For three of these proteins (SERF2, VPS25 and DCUND1D1), also a connection to chromatin or unmodified H1 has not been reported so far. To corroborate our findings, we validated DCUND1D1 and confirmed the specific enrichment for H1.2K17Ub chromatosome variants by western blot analysis (Figure 4 B). The BRCA1-associated BARD1 protein, the transcriptional coregulator MTA1, and the ubiquitin-specific protease USP16 were all enriched for\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/52/1/101/7442540 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 12 January 2024\nH1.2K64Ub chromatosomes in our study. For MTA1, it has been shown that it plays a role in the regulation of chromatin structure, but so far a physical interaction with H1 has not been reported ( 44 ). Furthermore, there exists a relatively large body of work that shows that BARD1 together with BRCA1 recognizes H2AK15-ubiquitylated nucleosomes in the event of DNA damage ( 45 ). Our data may suggest that the BARD1 / BRCA1 complex recognizes ubiquitylated chromatin in general. Future studies will therefore need to explore the role of H1 ubiquitylation in DNA damage ( 46 ) and investigate if BARD1 is able to directly detect ubiquitylated H1 or if a more indirect mechanism is taking place. USP16 has been linked to deubiquitylation of H2A ( 47 ), but so far no connection to linker histone H1 has been identified. This could indicate that H1.2K64Ub may function as another target of USP16 or that H1.2K64Ub serves as docking site for USP16 for subsequent H2A deubiquitylation.\nSeveral enriched proteins have known roles in DNA repair and interestingly, the preferential enrichment for either nucleosomes or chromatosomes was dependent on the specific DNA repair pathway they are involved in. Among nucleosome-enriched proteins were the exonuclease EXO1 , which is involved in multiple repair processes ( 48 ), and DNA polymerase \u03b2, which is involved in base excision repair ( 49 ). Furthermore, proteins of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway were also preferentially interacting with nucleosomes and here especially proteins, that carry out functions in more advanced steps of the repair process. Among these, the helicase XPB, a part of the TFIIH complex, as well as the nucleases XPF and XPG were identified, supporting a model where the actual repair of DNA damage by NER would occur in the absence of H1.2 and thus in a more open chromatin environment ( 50 ). Yet, RAD23B, part of a DNA damage sensing complex during NER ( 50 ) was present in the chromatosomeenriched cluster, suggesting a role for H1.2 in this process of damage recognition.\nFinally, proteins associated with the repair of double strand breaks (DSBs) via both known major pathways, homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), were enriched for chromatosomes. A potential explanation for the preferred binding of DSB repair proteins to chromatosomes is the blunt-ended dsDNA, which is part our affinity enrichment baits and resembles a DSB. Specific enrichment of repair proteins only in presence of H1.2 variants however indicates an important role of H1.2 in the recruitment of repair proteins to DSB sites. In the case of HR, the two endresection promoting proteins PSIP1 ( 51 ) and HDGFR2 ( 52 ) as well as POGZ, an interaction partner of HDGFR2 ( 52 ) were enriched as were all three heterochromatin binding proteins HP1 \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3. Specific enrichment of HP1 proteins in the presence of H1.2 suggests that their recognition of heterochromatin may have an H1.2-based component in addition to their known binding to heterochromatin marks on core histones ( 53 ).\nA Fisher exact test revealed that almost all proteins annotated with a role in NHEJ were enriched specifically for chromatosomes and here in particular by chromatosomes containing either unmodified H1.2, any of the ubiquitylated variants, or K17 acetylated H1.2 (Figure 4 A, Supplementary Figure S5 ). Chromatosomes containing K64 acetylated H1.2 in contrary showed less enrichment for NHEJ proteins. Ubiquitylation of linker histones with low site-specificity has been found to occur in response to DNA damage induced by UV irradiation\npreviously ( 46 ). Since acetylation of lysine 64 prohibits its ubiquitylation, impeded binding of the DSB repair machinery might indicate that of the investigated sites, lysine 64 is the one with the greater functional impact.\nAmong the enriched DSB repair proteins were XRCC5 and XRCC6 (Ku70, Ku80), which are all involved in DSB recognition and the regulating protein TP53BP1 ( 54 ) and references therein), but also proteins involved in later steps of NHEJ like the catalytic subunit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase, known to exert a regulatory function and XRCC4 which is needed for the final ligation step in complex with DNA ligase IV ( 54 ) and references therein).\nIn order to further support the results obtained by our AE-MS experiments, we validated specific PPIs by immunoblotting using primary antibodies against several enriched proteins (Figure 4 B and Supplementary Figure S6 ). For DCUN1D1 , our data confirmed the specific enrichment for H1.2K17Ub chromatosomes, and for XRCC4 and XRCC6 we could show preferential enrichment for chromatosomes in general (Figure 4 B and Supplementary Figure S6 ). The immunoblotting results thus overall support our mass spectrometry-based results.\nBased on our observation that nearly all the identified proteins from our AE-MS experiments with a known role in the NHEJ repair pathway showed a preferential enrichment for chromatosomes, we wanted to functionally validate this observation. We therefore set-up an assay that allowed us to study the ligation of two double-stranded oligonucleotides in vitro in a semi-quantitative manner and used the ligation reaction as a proxy for a DSB (Figure 4 C). Within this assay the enrichment of interacting proteins was performed as in our AE-MS experiments, but instead of eluting the proteins, these were then incubated with a radioactively labeled DNA substrate which had previously been shown to be preferentially repaired by proteins of the NHEJ pathway ( 37 ,38 ). Due to a self-complementary overhang, two of these DNA substrate molecules are ligated in the presence of DNA repair enzymes (Figure 4 C), resulting in a marked shift in PAGE analysis (Figure 4 D). The repair efficiency was then assessed by autoradiographic quantification of the band intensity of the dimeric ligation product and calculation of the relative dimer band intensity in comparison to a control, in which the DNA substrate molecules were incubated with HEK 293T lysate. As negative control, the repair assay was performed with immobilized nucleosomes or chromatosomes that were not preincubated with cell lysate, which did not result in any formation of the dimeric ligation product ( Supplementary Figure S7A ).\nApplying our assay in triplicates ( Supplementary Figure S7B ), we found statistically significant differences between chromatosome and nucleosome samples in their efficiency to promote DNA ligation. All chromatosome variants showed a significantly higher propensity to promote the ligation of double-stranded oligonucleotides than nucleosomes, in line with the differential enrichment of NHEJ DSB repair proteins seen in our AE-MS data (Figure 4 E, Supplementary Figure S7C ). When comparing the differently modified chromatosome variants relative to each other, acetylation of lysine 64 of H1.2 had the lowest effect on promoting DNA ligation. This effect was as well reflected in our AE-MS data, where chromatosomes containing H1.2K64Ac showed the least enrichment for DSB repair proteins. While linker histones have up to now been associated with an inhibitory role in the final ligation step of DSB repair by NHEJ ( 55 ) our observations\ns D\na g m a o a o g 1 p H\ni w a t N b a p m t u m u l D N M s a t s\nf s t s t t u N u t f o n (\nt H o a ( w o o o s m\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nar/article/52/1/101/7442540 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 12 January 2024\nuggest that H1.2 may be rather required in the vicinity of SBs to bind the proteins needed for DNA repair. When comparing the results obtained from chromatosome ffinity enrichments with previous studies that have investiated the interactome of H1.2 on its own - site-specifically odified at the same positions as in this work ( 14 ,15 )\u2014a reltively minor overlap between identified interactors could be bserved. Overall, 5 of the previously identified specific interctors of free H1 remained significantly enriched for at least ne of the chromatosome variants when we applied our strinent filtering ( Supplementary Figure S8 ). This corresponds to 7% of the proteins that we have identified as interactors of osttranslationally modified (i.e. ubiquitylated or acetylated) 1.2 in this work. It could be that proteins that only interact with free modfied or unmodified H1.2 bind to regions of H1.2 that otherise interact with DNA in chromatosomes. However, interctions between linker histones and DNA have been shown o occur between the globular domain of H1 as well as both - and C-terminal H1 tails ( 43 ). As the interaction appears to e mainly mediated by contacts between positively charged mino acid residues within H1 and the negatively charged hosphate backbone of DNA, no distinct DNA binding doain seems to exist for linker histones. Another possibility o explain the different binding behavior would be that H1 ndergoes a conformational change upon chromatosome foration. Along this line, it has been reported that binding of nmodified H1 to nucleosomes affects the flexibility of the inker DNA ( 56 ) and this altered accessibility of nucleosomal NA might also result in changes in the interaction behavior. onetheless, based on our robust and highly reproducible AES data we interpret these fairly separate sets of H1-PTMpecific interaction partners to strengthen the view of H1 as protein with distinct roles depending on its occurrence in he cell (free or chromatin-bound), an interpretation that is upported by previous observations ( 57 ,58 ).\nAmong the proteins that were found to be enriched for both ree H1.2 and chromatin-associated linker histone were the hitone chaperone NAP1L4, which showed preferential binding o H1.2K17Ac chromatosomes, and nucleoplasmin 3 which howed preferential binding to chromatosomes containing eiher of the acetylated H1.2-variants. Interestingly, both of hese proteins had previously been identified to be enriched for nmodified or ubiquitylated H1.2. Conversely, for the kinase OL9 which exhibited previously preferential enrichment for nmodified or acetylated H1.2, we now see stronger binding o unmodified or ubiquitylated chromatosome variants. Also, or the UV excision repair protein RAD23B, which had previusly been identified to be enriched for ubiquitylated H1.2, we ow see no preference for any of our chromatosome variants. 57 ,58 ).\nA search for annotated domains in uniprot for those proeins that were specifically enriched for chromatin-bound 1 showed that multiple of these proteins contain bromor chromodomains that are known to bind to acetylated nd methylated lysine residues in core histones ( 59 ,60 ) Supplementary Table S4 ). In contrast, for the proteins that ere previously found to be enriched for free H1.2 ( 14 ,15 ), nly few were shown to interact with chromatin components r to possess chromatin-interacting chromo- or bromodmains. It is therefore likely that many of the chromatosomepecific binders recognize chromatosome elements besides the odified linker histones. As we have employed intact chro-\nmatosomes as baits in our study, we cannot exclude that the interaction has been mediated by nucleosomal DNA or via another interactor rather than by direct H1.2 contacts. Yet, our study demonstrates that the presence of (modified) H1 is necessary for certain interactions to occur, as we observed specific enrichment for these proteins when using chromatosomes, and not nucleosomes, as baits."

            "text": "Here, we report on a tailored AE-MS platform for the study of PPIs of chromatosomes with site-specifically modified linker histone variants on a proteome-wide scale. Our AE-MS experiments provide novel insights into the cellular interaction partners of these chromatosome variants and reveal specific interactors of chromatin bound linker histone. The identification and validation of both modification- and site-specific PPIs in our study further supports the emerging picture of modular cellular interactomes that are driven not only by a given modification but also depend on the specific location of the respective PTM ( 14 , 15 , 61 , 62 ). Interestingly, proteins necessary for NHEJ of DNA double strand breaks preferentially bound to the various chromatosomes variants but not mere nucleosomes. This observation was independently validated by immunoblot analysis and functionally confirmed by an in vitro ligation assay. This unexpected finding is a starting point for further research into the role of H1.2 in response to DNA damage and particular in DSB repair.\nPrevious interactions studies using intact proteins as baits have either focused on modifications of core-histones ( 13 ) or employed only nucleosomes as baits ( 10 , 12 , 63 ). Thus, to the best of our knowledge our study is the first that uses intact chromatosome variants as baits for AE-MS to elucidate H1PTM-specific interactions, making a direct comparison with other studies difficult. A direct comparison of the present study with our previous studies ( 14 ,15 ), which employed free H1.2 that was site-specifically ubiquitylated at the same positions as the H1.2 variants used here, suggests different roles of ubiquitylated H1 when it is free (i.e. not bound to nucleosomes) in the cell or functions as part of chromatin. It also underscores the importance of investigating chromatin and chromatin PTMs with probes that closely approximate the complexity of native chromatin.\nMore generally, our modular chromatosome-baits assembled from building blocks and optimized workflow constitutes not only an important tool for future MS-based proteomics investigations of histone epigenetic modifications. Taken together our study supports the role of chromatin-bound H1.2 as a regulatory protein with distinct functions beyond DNA compaction and functions as an important resource for future investigations of histone epigenetic modifications."
