 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate the effects of other naturally occurring oxyprenylated coumarins on mitochondrial function when exposed to stressors like pesticides. The paper found auraptene and 7-isopentenyloxycoumarin had protective effects, so studying a broader range of similar compounds could identify more beneficial agents.

2. Examine the mechanism of action in more detail for how auraptene and 7-isopentenyloxycoumarin protect mitochondria under stress. Understanding the specific biomolecular pathways involved could help optimize their usage and efficacy. 

3. Evaluate the neuroprotective effects of auraptene and 7-isopentenyloxycoumarin in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's. The paper suggests they could have therapeutic potential based on mitochondrial protection.

4. Investigate the effects of combining auraptene and 7-isopentenyloxycoumarin together on mitochondrial function. They may have additive or synergistic effects when used in combination.

5. Explore formulation and delivery methods to improve bioavailability and mitochondrial targeting of auraptene and 7-isopentenyloxycoumarin. Enhancing their uptake and localization could boost their protective capacities.
