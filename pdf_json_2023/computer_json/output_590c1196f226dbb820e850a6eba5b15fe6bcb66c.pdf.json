    "abstractText": "We present a mass lumping approach based on an isogeometric Petrov-Galerkin method that preserves higher-order spatial accuracy in explicit dynamics calculations irrespective of the polynomial degree of the spline approximation. To discretize the test function space, our method uses an approximate dual basis, whose functions are smooth, have local support and satisfy approximate bi-orthogonality with respect to a trial space of B-splines. The resulting mass matrix is \u201cclose\u201d to the identity matrix. Specifically, a lumped version of this mass matrix preserves all relevant polynomials when utilized in a Galerkin projection. Consequently, the mass matrix can be lumped (via row-sum lumping) without compromising spatial accuracy in explicit dynamics calculations. We also address the imposition of Dirichlet boundary conditions and the preservation of approximate bi-orthogonality under geometric mappings. In addition, we establish a link between the exact dual and approximate dual basis functions via an iterative algorithm that improves the approximate dual basis towards exact bi-orthogonality. We demonstrate the performance of our higher-order accurate mass lumping approach via convergence studies and spectral analyses of discretized beam, plate and shell models.",

            "text": "I first arrived at the University of Texas at Austin in spring 2011, where I joined the Hughes research group as a visiting PhD student. I remember one afternoon in the old JP\u2019s Java, where Tom used to take us for a drink. Someone was talking about a leading figure in computational mechanics in his sixties who was thinking about moving to Harvard. I blurted out: \u201cWhy would they hire him? He will probably retire in two years...\u201d Being the gentleman he is, Tom looked at me smiling and said: \u201cDominik, you know, I moved to Texas in my sixties...\u201d and I completed for myself: and instead of retiring you (once more) revolutionized the world of computational mechanics by inventing IGA. Fast forward one and a half years - I had graduated in the meantime and was now a postdoc in his group - I told Tom that I was about to accept a job offer from a German aircraft engines manufacturer. To my surprise, he immediately told me that I couldn\u2019t do that. Combining rational arguments and subtle challenging, he then convinced me of the following plan: I would stay in Texas for six months more and submit a few applications for open professorship positions in the U.S., and in case I did not secure an academic job by then, I could start a career designing aircraft engines. The bottomline: by late 2013, Tom and his unique environment had transformed me from a PhD student into an aspiring assistant professor at the University of Minnesota. Happy Birthday, Tom, and thank you for all you have done and achieved for the field of computational mechanics, for our community and for so many of us colleagues and friends. (Dominik Schillinger)\nIsogeometric analysis (IGA) was initiated in 2005 by Tom and his students [1, 2] with the goal of bridging the gap between computer aided geometric design (CAD) and finite element analysis (FEA). The core idea of IGA is to use the same smooth and higher-order spline basis functions for the representation of both geometry in CAD and the approximation of physics-based field solutions in FEA [3]. IGA enables finite element approximations that are higher-order smooth, a feature that cannot be achieved in FEA based on nodal basis functions [4]. A key property of higher-order IGA, already discussed in one of the first articles [5], is its well-behaved discrete spectrum of eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes. The associated potential of IGA for higher-order accurate explicit dynamics calculations, however, lies largely idle to this day. One reason is that no practical methodology exists yet that reconciles higher-order accuracy and mass lumping. In this paper, we will focus on a new Petrov-Galerkin method that enables a higher-order accurate mass lumping that could help close this gap."

The superscript n is the time index that indicates that a variable is evaluated at time instant tn.\nIn many applications such as virtual testing of vehicle crashworthiness or the simulation-based design of metal forming processes, the internal force vector of the discrete system (1) involves shell elements, nonlinear material models, and contact with friction. For shell problems, most established finite element formulations are based on shear-deformable Reissner-Mindlin-type models [7], which\nallow the consistent evaluation of the integral in (1) with standard nodal basis functions. Due to their cost effectiveness and robustness against locking, state-of-the-art commercial software packages such as LS-Dyna or Pam-Crash mostly rely on lowest-order linear basis functions with reduced quadrature and hourglass control, which require very fine meshes to achieve accurate solutions on complex geometries.\nFor the resulting large and ill-conditioned systems, however, iterative equation solvers required by implicit methods do not converge well and are thus prohibitively expensive [6].\nAs a result, explicit dynamics based on explicit second-order accurate time integration methods such as the central difference method or variations thereof [8], has established itself as the key technology for efficiently solving (1) [9, 10]. Given a lumping scheme to diagonalize the mass matrix, its inversion in (1) becomes trivial and the dominating cost of the explicit multistep procedure shifts entirely to the evaluation of the internal force vector. In addition, a diagonal mass matrix significantly reduces memory and facilitates parallel computing, as global system matrices and the associate assembly or inversion procedures do never explicitly occur. An alternative pathway to explicit dynamics with diagonal mass matrices in FEA is the use of so-called Gauss-Lobatto Lagrange basis functions with nodes at the Gauss-Lobatto points in conjunction with GaussLobatto quadrature [11, 12, 13, 14]. This is the only technique established so far that obtains higher-order spatial accuracy in explicit dynamics with a diagonal mass matrix [15, 16]. We note that within the last decade, there has been a new increase in research and development in higherorder explicit structural analysis with C0-continuous finite elements, both in academia, see e.g. [17, 18, 19, 15, 20, 21] and in industry, see e.g. the commercial codes IMPETUS [22] and LS-Dyna [23], which in addition to standard linear elements also promote second- and third-order elements.\nExplicit schemes, however, are only conditionally stable. Therefore, the step size, with which they march forward in time, cannot exceed a maximum critical time step size [24], which is inversely proportional to the maximum eigenfrequency \u03c9max of the discretization: \u2206 t n crit \u223c 1/\u03c9nmax. Due to this dependence, control of the highest frequencies in the spectrum is indispensable for guaranteeing acceptable time step sizes and hence efficient explicit dynamics calculations. In FEA, the impact of \u03c9max can be alleviated, e.g., via selective mass scaling [25] or time step subcycling [26]."

In addition to mesh refinement, spline functions naturally enable the increase of the polynomial degree (p-refinement), or both at the same time (k-refinement). For elastostatic-type problems, it has been consistently shown across the pertinent literature that higher-order IGA is superior to FEA based on nodal basis functions in terms of per-degree-of-freedom accuracy [27]. A variety of advanced formulations for isogeometric structural analysis have been developed over the past decade, in particular for shells based on Kirchhoff-Love [28, 29], Reissner-Mindlin [30, 31, 32, 33], and solid-type models [34, 35], and hierarchic combinations thereof [36, 37]. Isogeometric shell formulations have been applied for explicit dynamics calculations, based on the adoption of standard row-sum lumping to diagonalize the mass matrix [38, 39]. In addition, selective mass scaling [6] and different methods to obtain time step estimates [6, 40] known from FEA based on nodal basis functions have been applied in an IGA context. But studies on explicit dynamics with shell IGA and standard mass lumping have reported sub-optimal results.

            "text": "The removal of this gap requires the development of novel spline-centered technology that leverages the additional opportunities provided by this class of basis functions. A first attempt\nwas presented in [42], based on the idea of using dual spline functions. This set of spline functions is defined \u201cdual\u201d to a set of standard B-splines, such that the inner product of the two integrated over a domain yields a diagonal matrix (bi-orthogonality). Hence, if a dual basis is used as the test space in a finite element formulation, we naturally end up with a consistent diagonal mass matrix [42]. In CAD research, the bi-orthogonality property has been well known for decades, and several approaches for the construction of the underlying dual basis exist, see e.g. [43]. In the computational mechanics community, this property has been used for different purposes, e.g. for dual mortar methods [44, 45] or for unlocking of Reissner-Mindlin shell formulations [46].\nDual spline basis functions still suffer from shortcomings when applied as test functions in the variational formulation of elastodynamics as envisioned in [42], to the extent that their use in explicit dynamics seems not straightforward: Firstly, bi-orthogonality in general holds only on the parametric domain, but is in general lost under non-affine geometric mappings. Secondly, dual spline functions with the same smoothness as their B-spline counterparts have global support on each patch, thus producing fully populated stiffness forms. Their support can be reduced, but at the price of losing continuity, leading to discontinuous functions in the fully localized case. Both are prohibitive in a finite element context. And thirdly, dual basis functions are not interpolatory at the boundaries. Therefore, the identification of a kinematically admissible set of test functions that allows the variationally consistent strong imposition of Dirichlet boundary conditions is not straightforward.\nIn this paper, we present an isogeometric Petrov-Galerkin method that combines the dual basis concept and standard row-sum lumping and achieves higher-order accuracy in explicit dynamics irrespective of the polynomial degree of the spline approximation. Its key ingredients are a class of \u201capproximate\u201d dual spline functions that was introduced in [47]. It only approximately satisfies the discrete bi-orthogonality property, but preserves all other properties of the original B-spline basis, such as Cp\u22121 smoothness, polynomial reproduction and local support. We employ the approximate dual functions to discretize the test function space in the variational formulation of elastodynamics. This leads to a semidiscrete Petrov-Galerkin formulation that can be written in the format (1), whose consistent mass matrix M is not diagonal, but is, in some sense, \u201cclose\u201d to the identity matrix. Specifically, its row-sum lumped mass preserved all polynomials up to degree p when used in a Galerkin projection. Consequently, the row-sum lumped mass matrix may be used in explicit dynamics without compromising higher-order spatial accuracy. In Fig. 1b, we anticipate the result of our isogeometric Petrov-Galerkin formulation with approximate dual basis functions and rowsum lumping for the classical example of the one-dimensional bar. We observe that the spectrum of our method maintains accuracy in the low and medium range of modes, which is a significant improvement over the standard IGA Galerkin formulation with mass lumping. We note that when the mass matrix is evaluated consistently without lumping, the two methods yield exactly the same spectrum shown in Fig. 1a.\nWe note that a similar approach is presented in [48]. It consists of a minimally invasive technique, based on approximate dual test functions, which can be applied in the sense of preconditioner by a simple matrix pre-multiplication. They show high-order convergent results and a straightforward application of Dirichlet boundary conditions by manipulating this transformation matrix. An additional row-summing step is required to convert the banded into a diagonal mass matrix.\nThe structure of our paper is as follows: In Section 2, we briefly review the definition and construction of approximate dual functions of B-splines. In addition, we present an iterative scheme for improving the approximate dual basis towards exactly satisfying bi-orthogonality. In\nSection 3, we derive our isogeometric Petrov-Galerkin formulation with mass lumping for higherorder accurate explicit dynamics. In Section 4, we present numerical examples of beam and plate problems, demonstrating that our Petrov-Galerkin scheme indeed preserves higher-order accuracy in explicit dynamics calculations. In Section 5, we provide a critical discussion of the potential significance of our results, highlight by means of a more involved shell benchmark that extending the demonstrated benefits to practical problems might not be immediate, and motivate potential future research directions."

One approach is to compute the dual function of the Bernstein polynomials, using the inverse of the Gramian matrix for a Be\u0301zier element, and then to apply the Be\u0301zier extraction operator to obtain the dual of the B-spline basis [52, 45].

The approximate dual basis preserves important properties of the underlying B-spline basis, such as Cp\u22121 regularity and local support. The construction of G\u0302\u22121 does not require any matrix inversion, see [47] or the worked-out example in Appendix A. It is a recursive computation, based on fundamental properties of B-splines such as the nestedness of spaces under knot insertion. For a 1D patch of splines, the approximate inverse matrix G\u0302\u22121 is symmetric and positive definite with a bandwidth of at most p + 1 [47].\nFor illustration purposes, we plot the approximate dual functions (9) next to the corresponding quadratic C1-continuous B-spline basis. We observe that the approximate dual functions preserve the Cp\u22121-continuity of the B-spline functions and have local support. Their support, however, is larger than that of the corresponding spline functions due to the band structure of G\u0302\u22121.\nRemark 2.2. We note that in general, the approximate dual basis does not preserve the partition of unity and non-negativity properties of B-splines. Partition of unity, however, could be restored by scaling the approximate dual with the inverse of its function value sum.\nIn this paper, we consider tensor-product extensions to multivariate dual B-spline functions. To this end, we use the same spline space S in every coordinate direction such that the multivariate spaces in the two-dimensional case is S \u2297 S. In the parametric domain, the tensor product structure\nleads to matrices with Kronecker structure due to affine mapping. We note that the approximate dual functions can also be extended to non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) as shown in [54]."

Discretizing the solution u and the test function w in (21) with standard B-splines and the original approximate dual functions (9), respectively, does not preserve the approximate bi-orthogonality in the physical domain.\nTo preserve the approximate bi-orthogonality in the physical domain, we discretize u with standard B-splines of degree p, Bi(x), i = 1, . . . , N , and w with modified approximate dual functions that are divided by the determinant of the Jacobian matrix of the mapping:\nB\u0303i(x\u0302) \u2236= B\u0302i(x\u0302) C(x\u0302) , i = 1, . . . , N .

It corresponds to a geometry map \u03a6 \u2236 \u2126\u0302 \u2192 \u2126 that maps a point x\u0302 from the parametric domain \u2126\u0302 to a point x in the physical domain \u2126. We assume that \u03a6 is sufficiently smooth and invertible such that the Jacobian matrix and its inverse are well-defined.\nThe modified functions defined in (22) constitute the approximate dual basis of the standard B-spline basis in the physical domain \u2126, where it approximately satisfies the bi-orthogonality\nconstraint (5) in the same sense as the original approximate dual basis (9) in the parametric domain \u2126\u0302:\n(B\u0303i, Bj)\u2126 = \u222b\u2126 B\u0303i(x\u0302)Bj(x\u0302)d\u2126 = \u222b\u2126\u0302 B\u0302i(x\u0302)C(x\u0302) Bj(x\u0302)C(x\u0302)d \u2126\u0302 = \u222b\n\u2126\u0302 B\u0302i(x\u0302)Bj(x\u0302)d \u2126\u0302 = (B\u0302i, Bj)\u2126\u0302 . (23)\nThe modified functions B\u0303i are linearly independent due to the linear independence of the approximate dual functions B\u0302i and preserve their local support. Their regularity, however, depends on the smoothness of the Jacobian C(x\u0302).\nWe are now in a position to discretize the weak form (18). To this end, we first write the discretized displacement solution uh and the discretized test function wh as:\nuh(x, t) = [B1(x) . . . BN(x)] u\u0302h(t) , wh(x) = [B\u03031(x) . . .

The discrete trial space Sh and the discrete test spaceS\u0303h are then: Sh \u2236= span (Bi(x\u0302))i\u2208[1,N] , S\u0303h \u2236= span (B\u0303i(x\u0302))i\u2208[1,N] = span(B\u0302i(x\u0302)C(x\u0302) )i\u2208[1,N] .

(26) Figure 5 shows a one-dimensional example: Sh contains a standard quadratic B-spline patch, and S\u0303h contains the corresponding modified approximate dual functions. For illustration purposes, we assume a geometric map based on a quarter circle with unit radius represented by NURBS. We also plot the corresponding non-constant function of the Jacobian determinant. Remark 3.2. In general, due to the Jacobian determinant C(x\u0302) in the denominator, the approximate dual functions (22) span a different space as the corresponding B-splines. Therefore, Sh andS\u0303h represent two different spaces. Hence, the semidiscrete formulation (26) is in general a PetrovGalerkin formulation. Only in the special case of a constant Jacobian determinant, the modified approximate dual function functions (22) span the same space as the original approximate dual functions (9), since they are only scaled by a constant factor, and thus (26) falls back to a Galerkin formulation.\nRemark 3.3. The differential operators in (26) require the following derivatives of the modified approximate dual functions (22):\nB\u0303i,\u03b1 = (B\u0302i C ) ,\u03b1 = 1 C B\u0302i,\u03b1 \u2212 1 C2 B\u0302iC,\u03b1 , (27a) B\u0303i,\u03b1\u03b2 = (B\u0302i C ) ,\u03b1\u03b2 = 1 C B\u0302i,\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 1 C2 B\u0302i,\u03b1C,\u03b2 \u2212 1 C2 B\u0302i,\u03b2 C,\u03b1 \u2212 1 C3\nB\u0302i (C,\u03b1\u03b2 C \u2212 2C,\u03b1C,\u03b2) .

The approximation I\u0302, however, is not diagonal, and hence precludes efficient explicit dynamics, when e.g. a central difference scheme in time is applied to (30).\nOur central idea to enable efficient higher-order accurate explicit dynamics based on (30) is simple: we apply standard row-sum mass lumping to diagonalize the approximate identity matrix I\u0302. It is straightforward to show that this leads in fact to the identity matrix I. Theorem: The application of row-sum lumping to the matrix (B\u0302i, Bj)\u2126\u0302 yields the identity matrix. Proof : Let P \u2208 Pp be a polynomial of degree p in the parametric domain \u2126\u0302, and consider the spline basis Bi, i = 1, . . . , N and its approximate dual basis B\u0302i. There exists a set of coefficients ui such that: (B\u0302i, Bj)\u2126\u0302 uj = (B\u0302i, P )\u2126\u0302 . (31) The spline basis Bi reproduces polynomials P \u2208 Pp, i.e. \u2211Nj=1 Bj uj = P . If f = 1, uj = 1 due to the partition of unity \u2211Nj=1 Bj(x\u0302) = 1. We thus obtain:\n(B\u0302i, Bj)\u2126\u0302 1 = (B\u0302i, 1)\u2126\u0302 = 1 . (32) Our hypothesis is that the effect of row-sum lumping does not preclude higher-order accuracy, as I\u0302 is already close to the true identity matrix, which is of course diagonal. We will show by way of numerical examples that this is indeed the case."

We expect that the first two aspects do not differ significantly between the isogeometric Galerkin method and our isogeometric Petrov-Galerkin method. In this context, we refer to outlier removal techniques to prevent prohibitively small critical time steps [41, 56, 57] and to advanced quadrature schemes for spline discretizations that significantly reduce the number of quadrature points with respect to standard Gauss quadrature per Be\u0301zier element [58, 59, 60].\nThe cost of the evaluation of the internal force vector requires a more detailed analysis. Just as standard B-splines (or NURBS), the modified approximate dual basis functions can be cast into a Be\u0301zier or Lagrange extraction format per element [61, 62], whose derivation from relation (10) and the appoximate inverse of the Gramian matrix is straightforward. The extraction operators can be computed in an offline step, such that they do not contribute to the online cost of explicit dynamics calculations. In a Petrov-Galerkin sense, bilinear stiffness forms are not symmetric, as we are using different test and trial functions on the right-hand side. In explicit dynamics, this is not an issue per se, as the stiffness matrix is never assembled, stored, or inverted. The central difference to the standard Galerkin scheme, however, is that the support of the modified approximate dual functions\nis larger than the one of the standard B-splines (or NURBS). According to Table 1, the support of an approximate dual function is up to 3p + 1 Be\u0301zier elements in each parametric direction, as compared to p + 1 for the corresponding B-spline. For two-dimensional elements, such as plates or shells, due to the increased support of the basis functions of the discrete test space, the internal force vector has eight to nine times as many entries, and we have to expect approximately eight to nine times as many basis function related operations to compute it. In practical scenarios, computationally costly routines to take into account nonlinear material behavior, such as radial return algorithms in plasticity, do not depend on the cost or number of the basis functions of the discrete test space, and hence the net increase in computational cost per quadrature point will be much lower. It remains to be seen how our Petrov-Galerkin scheme can be implemented in a competitive fashion and how much this disadvantage in computational cost then really matters in comparison with its advantage in accuracy."

We can obtain the exact solution in terms of eigenvalues and mode shapes from the continuous problem, given for instance in [68].\nWe solve the discrete eigenvalue problem (35) by discretizing the beam with 500 Be\u0301zier elements. We then employ our Petrov-Galerkin formulation discussed above, using B-splines and\nthe corresponding approximate dual functions, and the standard Galerkin formulation, using only B-splines, all for degrees p = 2 through 5. We then do the analysis of each formulation once with a consistent mass matrix and once with a lumped mass matrix based on the row-sum technique. Figure 12 plots the eigenvalues of the discrete problem in ascending order, normalized with respect to the corresponding exact eigenvalues of the continuous problem versus the normalized mode number. Figure 13 plots the relative L2 error in the corresponding mode shapes, versus the normalized mode number.\nWe observe in all plots that the eigenvalues and mode shape errors obtained with the PetrovGalerkin and Galerkin methods and a consistent mass matrix are identical. The reason behind this observation is that in the current example, due to the constant determinant of the Jacobian matrix, the modified approximate dual functions span the same space as the B-splines, and hence both methods need to produce the same results, when the variational formulations are evaluated\nand solved consistently. We now focus on the results obtain with mass lumping. In Fig. 12, we observe that our Petrov-Galerkin approach with lumped mass matrix leads to significantly better spectral accuracy compared to the standard Galerkin approach with lumped mass matrix. The difference between the results of the two approaches becomes more pronounced with increasing polynomial degree. For p = 5, for instance, we see that in our Petrov-Galerkin approach, the first 40% of the eigenvalues are close to the desired ratio of 1.0, whereas in the Galerkin approach, this is achieved by only about 5%. Figure 13 indicates the same trend for the error in the corresponding mode shapes.

We observe that the Petrov-Galerkin method with mass lumping achieves the same optimal convergence as the Galerkin method with consistent mass matrix, while the Galerkin method with mass lumping only achieves second-order convergence for all polynomial degrees. We note that the optimal convergence rate of the eigenvalue error and the L2 error in the mode isO(2(p \u2212 1)) and O(p + 1), respectively [8, 69]. These results indicate that unlike in the standard Galerkin method, mass lumping in our Petrov-Galerkin method does not affect optimal convergence of analysis results.\nWe now investigate how these results transfer to the two-dimensional case.

In Fig. 15, we can observe again significant accuracy advantages of our Petrov-Galerkin scheme with mass lumping over the standard Galerkin scheme with mass lumping in the spectrum results. Figure 15 confirms our observation that unlike in the standard Galerkin method, mass lumping does not affect the optimal convergence of our Petrov-Galerkin method."

            "text": "To further elucidate the accuracy of our Petrov-Galerkin scheme based on approximate dual functions and mass lumping, we use the iterative approach discussed in Section 2.4 to gradually improve the bi-orthogonality property of the approximate dual basis. To this end, we consider again the two examples of the unconstrained Euler-Bernoulli beam in 1D and the simply supported square plate in 2D. We now employ our Petrov-Galerkin scheme with an iteratively improved mass matrix, where we use one or two corrector passes (r = 1,2) before mass lumping, and compare the corresponding spectral results to those obtained with the Petrov-Galerkin scheme with a consistent mass matrix and mass lumping without improvement (r = 0).\nFor the Euler-Bernoulli beam, the normalized eigenvalues and the relative L2 error in the corresponding mode shapes are plotted versus the normalized mode number in Figs. 17 and 18, respectively. We observe that with increasing number of corrector passes, the spectrum curves quickly approach the reference solution obtained with the consistent mass matrix. We see that the iterative improvement is particularly efficient for improving the accuracy of the mode shapes. After two corrector passes, the L2 error curve of the Petrov-Galerkin scheme with mass lumping is practically the same as the one of the reference for polynomial degrees p = 2 to 4 throughout the complete spectrum, and a clear difference is only noticeable in the high modes for p = 5.\nFigure 19 plots the normalized eigenvalues versus the normalized mode number for the simply supported square plate. We observe that in this case, a lumped mass matrix with one or two corrector passes can eliminate the error in the eigenvalue spectrum completely. For p = 5, the normalized eigenvalue curve obtained with a consistent mass matrix and the lumped mass matrix with only one corrector pass are practically indistinguishable throughout the complete spectrum. We conclude that - although we have not used the iterative improvement in our simple benchmark calculations here - it could represent a tool to improve spectral accuracy of the Petrov-Galerkin approach in future more challenging applications."

            "text": "In this paper, we introduced an isogeometric Petrov-Galerkin formulation that enables higherorder accurate mass lumping. It is based on B-splines to discretize the solution fields and corresponding approximate dual functions with local support to discretize the test functions. We demonstrated via convergence studies and spectral analysis for beam and plate models that our Petrov-Galerkin method leads to higher-order accurate solutions in explicit dynamics, also when the mass matrix is lumped. Our results thus confirm that mass lumping as such does not have to be a deal-breaker for higher-order accuracy in the context of isogeometric explicit dynamics calculations, if one adequately exploits the additional opportunities of splines.\nWe also presented several ideas to resolve related technical issues. Firstly, we showed that\nthe approximate bi-orthogonality property, which is in general destroyed under non-affine geometry mapping, is preserved when we use modified approximate dual functions that are divided by the Jacobian determinant. Secondly, we discussed options for the weak and strong imposition of Dirichlet boundary conditions. For the latter, we suggested to replace the few non-interpolatory approximate dual functions at the Dirichlet boundary by standard B-splines, restoring the interpolation property as a prerequisite for the strong imposition of Dirichlet boundary conditions. We also presented an algorithm for iteratively improving the approximate bi-orthogonality property of the dual basis. While its application is not necessary for securing higher-order accurate results, in particular given the additional computational cost, it establishes a rigorous link between truly dual and approximate dual basis functions and the accuracy of the associated spectra."

            "text": "To get an idea whether its advantages directly transfer to more involved explicit dynamics calculations, we employ our Petrov-Galerkin method with mass lumping to solve the test case of a pinched cylinder, whose set-up is given in Fig. 20. Our implementation follows the KirchhoffLove shell model and its isogeometric discretization presented in [28], assuming large deformation kinematics and the St. Venant-Kirchhoff constitutive model. In our Petrov-Galerkin approach, we apply B-splines to discretize the displacement solution and modified approximate dual functions to discretize the virtual displacements, while the geometry map is provided by an exact NURBS representation of the cylinder. We use the central difference method to integrate in time, with a time step size of \u2206t = 5 \u22c5 10\u22128. The mass matrix of the Petrov-Galerkin scheme is lumped via the standard row-sum technique, except for the few rows that correspond to coefficients of the boundary B-spline functions.\nThe point load P is linearly increased from zero to Pmax during the time T = 1/30. Using symmetry, we compute one eighth of the cylinder that we discretize with cubic, quartic and quintic splines on a mesh of 32\u00d732 Be\u0301zier elements. This resolution is known in the literature to be adequate for this problem [39], which exhibits highly localized features in the displacement solution due to the point load and the appearance of wrinkles during deformation. In addition, this resolution guarantees that locking phenomena, in particular membrane locking, are controlled. Figure 21 illustrates three snapshots from the deformation history.\nTo assess the performance of our Petrov-Galerkin method, we compare its displacement response to the results obtained with the standard Galerkin method with a consistent mass matrix and with a row-sum lumped mass matrix. We plot the load-deflection curves at points A and B, that is uz,A and ux,B, in Fig. 22. As an additional reference, we also include the static solution (black curves), as the explicit dynamic results oscillate around the static solution after snap-through [39].\nWe observe that for the given mesh, all three methods lead to practically the same displacement response, irrespective of the polynomial degree considered. We note that we also tried to lower the resolution by repeating the same study on meshes with 16\u00d716 Be\u0301zier elements. We found that the three methods still yield displacement results that are overall equivalent, but all deviate from the static solution, and hence are not accurate.\nThese results of a more involved test case confirm that our Petrov-Galerkin scheme also works here. But they also indicate that its advantages might not always be as evident in practical applications as in the simple benchmarks shown in Section 4 above."

            "text": "From our viewpoint, there are two particularly important technical aspects that remain to be investigated. One is an in-depth performance test of our Petrov-Galerkin method in more involved scenarios, extending our initial results presented above. In particular, relevant scenarios feature typical challenges in explicit dynamics calculations, including shell elements, large deformations, contact, nonlinear material behavior, and their combinations. The other one is a detailed analysis of the computational efficiency, in particular with respect to the computational cost of a competitive matrix-free implementation that fully exploits additional technical opportunities of spline functions such as the exploitation of their tensor-product structure [71], the use of optimal quadrature rules with minimal number of points [60], and the removal of outliers [41].\nThe results presented in this paper open up further directions for future technical work. One is the capability of directly building interpolatory boundary basis functions and/or the required Dirichlet boundary conditions into the approximate dual space. Another one is the combination of locking preventing mechanisms with the approximate dual basis, in order to enable accurate solution fields on coarse meshes. Another challenge, for which no initial idea exists, is to extend the concept of the approximate dual basis as a test function space to trimmed Be\u0301zier elements."
