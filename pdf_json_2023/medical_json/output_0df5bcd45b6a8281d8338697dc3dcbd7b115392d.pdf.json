The data were reconstructed using MIMICS16.0 software and modelled to design and measure the nailing parameters. A three-dimensional model was established using ANSYS14.0 software, and the actual surgical procedure was simulated using biomechanical experiments. The model was verified by comparing the X-ray films obtained from patients during preoperative forward bending, stretching and lateral flexion, with the model further tested using the Hueter-Volkmann principle.\nResult: On comparing the measurements across three different load cases (forward bending, after stretching and lateral flexion) in patients with AS after thoracic lumbar protrusion deformity and the original X-ray images, no difference was found between the model of deformation and real patient movement displacement across the vertebral body. On simulating the stress distribution, the measured T10-L4 vertebral body stress values at every point in the injured vertebrae were, on the whole, directed at both the upper and lower ends and exhibited a decreasing trend, and the stress distribution gradually decreased from the injured vertebrae (T12 and L1) to the upper and lower ends.\nConclusion: The accuracy of the research model is high, the geometric similarity is good and relevant applied anatomy can be undertaken using the model parameter measurement. This study provides a successful example of the application of digital technology in the field of spinal deformity and a novel idea for the treatment of AS-related kyphosis.\nKEYWORDS\nankylosing spondylitis, protrusion deformity surgery simulation, finite element analysis, digital model, AS-related kyphosis"

            "text": "Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease that primarily affects the spine and can lead to thoracolumbar kyphosis deformity in later stages (S\u00f6dergren et al., 2021; Tang et al., 2022). The condition typically presents with symptoms of sacroiliac joint pain that gradually progresses upwards, involving the lumbar, thoracolumbar, thoracic and cervical regions of the spine (Chang et al., 2005; Qian et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2021). The mainstay of treatment for late-stage AS involves surgery or orthosis. Osteotomy is a common surgical method used to treat advanced thoracolumbar kyphosis in patients with AS (Liu et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Li et al., 2022). Combined vertebral arch and vertebral body osteotomy represents a recent advancement in late orthopaedic surgery for thoracic and lumbar kyphosis related to AS (Bourghli et al., 2021). Thoracolumbar kyphosis deformity is a challenging condition to manage; however, surgical intervention can provide significant relief in patients with advanced disease.\nSurgery is required to not only correct kyphosis but also maintain sagittal balance (Hiyama et al., 2019). Osteotomy angles that are either too large or too small have the potential to affect spine biomechanics following surgery; however, there exist few relevant studies on the specific effects. With the development of informative technologies, computer simulation modelling and biomechanical analysis, their effective integration within medicine has had a tremendous impact on spinal surgery. Using the finite elementmethod of biomechanics, it is possible to perform simulations for specific cases, including in terms of orthopaedic devices and strategies to predict postoperative orthopaedic outcomes, analysing the influence of intraoperative parameter selection on outcomes and guiding surgical planning.\nThis study utilises three-dimensional (3D) digital modelling technology to conduct personalised surgical design for a patient with postoperative kyphosis deformity related to AS. Finite element analysis was employed to predict the surgical outcomes. The study presents a precise and individualised approach for surgical planning in AS-related postoperative kyphosis deformity."

The abdomen and chest were padded with cotton sticks, and the upper limbs were flexed and fixed on the abduction frame. The skin in the conventional operative field was disinfected with 2% iodophor three times, the surgical sheet was spread with a surgical towel and the protective film was affixed. An incision with a length of approximately 20 cmwas made at the posterior median of T10-L4 spinous processes in the chest. The skin was cut open, the subcutaneous tissue was electrically cut, the supraspinous ligament was cut at the midline between the thoracolumbar fascia and spinous process, and subperiosteal dissection was performed along the side of the spinous process and lamina using a periosteal stripper. Both sides of the vertebral lamina and the superior and inferior articular processes were exposed. During the operation, the size and progress angle of the internal fixation screw designed according to the preoperative data were inserted into the right vertebral pedicle of T10, T11, T12, L2, L3, and L4. The intraoperative radiographs confirmed that the fixed vertebral body and the positioning direction were correct. The positioning needle was removed, drilling holes were made along the designed entry point and direction and taps were created. The four walls and\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin.org03\nbottom of the pedicle probe were made of bone. A universal screw (6.0 \u00d7 40 mm) was inserted into the left pedicle of T10, and 6.0 \u00d7 45- mm screws were inserted into the left pedicle of the 11th and 12th thoracic vertebrae. A 6.5 \u00d7 50-mm universal pedicle screw was then inserted into the left pedicle of the L2, L3 and L4 vertebrae, and the same screw was inserted on the right side of the same vertebra in the same manner. During the operation, both sides of the L1 vertebra, the lower margin of the T12 vertebra and both sides of the T12-L1 intervertebral disc were carefully separated. According to the \u201ctriangle\u201d bone block removed by preoperative design, the lamina at the lower margin of T12, the disc at T12-L1, the upper half of the L1 vertebral body and vertebral pedicle, the corresponding lamina and the yellow ligament were removed, the upper and lower vertebral canals at the osteotomy were expanded, the pre-curved orthopaedic rod was placed on both sides, part of the nuts were locked, and the osteotomy space was closed by pressure (after the osteotomy face is closed, the residual spinous process, lamina and vertebral body osteotomy surface can come into close contact; spinal canal continuity remains intact) and the lock fixed. The intraoperative radiography results confirmed that the position and fixation of the 12 screws were good, the osteotomy and orthosis were good and the physiological curvature of the lumbar spine was restored. The laminae on both sides of the T11-L3 vertebrae were chiselled into a irregular skeletal surface using a bone knife. Prefabricated bone strips and allogeneic bones were laid on the surface and transverse connecting rods were installed.\n2.5 Establishment of the three-dimensional finite element model\nThe 3Dmodel of the thoracolumbar segment in patients with AS was established using the MIMICS16.0 software, with the 3D automatic registration function of the software used for automatic registration. After registration, the 3-matic 8.0 software was opened directly, the surface mesh was divided into vertebrae, intervertebral discs and endoplants, and the surface mesh was optimised using the auto-remesh function. Following surface mesh division, volume mesh division was performed before each structure was imported into the MIMICS16.0 software. The\ngrayscale assignment function of the software was used to assign material values to the vertebrae and intervertebral discs, and the existing ligament material parameters were inputted (Table 1).\n2.6 Finite element model verification\nBecause the finite element model was established when the patient was lying flat, the patient was asked to adopt the same position during model verification to eliminate any change in spine shape caused by body weight. After CT was performed, the patient lay flat on the bed, underwent positive and lateral X-rays in a supine position and positive and lateral X-rays while flexed laterally, and the pelvis was fixed according to routine procedures. The patient was photographed in the maximum lateral flexure position as far as possible. The patient gave their informed consent for all experimental procedures, which were also approved by the ethics committee of the school.\nThe established finite element model was simulated and loaded, and the lower-edge surface of the L4 vertebra was fixed. A 500-N load was continuously applied to the upper surface of the T10 vertebra and was evenly distributed to each node on the surface. While the 500-N load was vertically loaded, a 15-Nm torque was applied to the upper surface of the T10 vertebra and the load was divided into three conditions: forward bending, backward extension and lateral bending.\nQualitative and quantitative methods were used to represent displacement, which was measured using a deformation distribution nephogram.\nThe deviation distance between the body and heart of each T10L4 vertebra and the perpendicular line of the sacrum was measured to compare the differences between the model and radiographs."

In this study, a 3D digital model of thoracolumbar kyphosis deformity related to AS was selected. The internal fixator of the nail rod was implanted into the model, and mesh division and finite element analysis were performed.\nFIGURE 4 Nephogram of lateral curvature in kyphotic deformity of T10-L4 ankylosing spondylitis.\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin.org06\nThe establishment of a finite element model ensures consistency with the real object in terms of both appearance and mechanical properties. Effective verification following the establishment of the finite element model is crucial for subsequent biomechanical research (Varga et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2018). The appearance of the T10-L4 finite element model established in this study was superimposed on the thin-slice CT image data of real patients processed using medical image processing software, meaning the appearance was consistent with the spinal model of real patients. To further verify the consistency between the model and the actual patient\u2019s mechanical properties, the coronal plane line morphology of the body and heart of each vertebra on the preoperative clinical lateral flexion radiographs of patients with AS-related kyphosis and the finite element simulation lateral flexion pictures were compared and the migration distance of the body and heart of each vertebra relative to the vertical line of the sacrum was calculated. There was no difference between the comparison model and the distance measured using X-ray. The model was consistent with a real patient model, and the\nFIGURE 5 Nephogram of anterior flexion in kyphotic deformity of T10-L4 ankylosing spondylitis.\nFIGURE 6 Nephogram of posterior extension of kyphotic deformity of T10L4 ankylosing spondylitis.\nFIGURE 7 Nephogramof vertical stress distribution after loading in kyphotic deformity of T10-L4 ankylosing spondylitis.\nFIGURE 8 Nephogram of vertical stress loading in kyphotic deformity of T10-L4 ankylosing spondylitis.\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin.org07\nmechanical properties of the model presented herein are consistent with those of a real model (Hambli, 2014; Podshivalov et al., 2014).\nTo further study the inherent biomechanical characteristics of ASrelated kyphosis in the T10-L4 vertebrae, the model loading was simulated, with the lower edge surface of the L4 vertebra fixed, a 500-N load was continuously applied on the upper surface of the T10 vertebra and the load was evenly distributed on each node of the surface. At the same time, when the 500-N loadwas vertically loaded, as revealed in the stress distribution histogram, the stress at the anterior edge of the T12-L1 vertebrae was the highest, and the maximum point stress value was 7.643MPa. The main reason for this was that the compression fracture at the anterior edge of the T12-L1 vertebrae, spinal deformity, common stress on the normal articular process, and upper and lower endplates of the vertebrae are concentrated at the anterior edge of the vertebrae. Therefore, compressive bone vertebrae have the most concentrated stress at the anterior edge of the body, which is also the most prone to further injury, leading to spinal instability. The second reason relates to the anterior edge of the L2-L3 vertebrae, the maximum stress value of which is 2.58MPa, indicating that with the fracture of the T12-L1 vertebrae, stress is borne downwards along the anterior edge of the L2-L3 vertebrae, which also becomes the relative concentration point of stress, thus aggravating the injury. Therefore, the entire spinal segment, except T12-L1, is easily compressed again, and the lower L2-L3 vertebrae are prone to secondary compression fractures. In the entire study segment, the stress distribution gradually decreased from the injured vertebrae (T12 and L1) to the upper and lower ends.\nFor T10-L4, the spinous process stress is relatively dispersed, and the spinous process is less prone to injury or fracture. The stress in the L3 and L4 pedicles was more concentrated than that in the spinous process, with a maximum value of 1.98 MPa, indicating that this pedicle segment is also prone to fracture injury.\nThis study utilised 3D digital technology and finite element analysis to establish individualised spinal models for patients with AS, design\nprecise osteotomy correction plans and predict and evaluate surgical outcomes. This provides a new approach for computer-assisted precision surgical treatment of postoperative kyphosis in AS.\nHowever, as an initial exploratory study, the sample size was limited to only one case, resulting in limited clinical representation of the results. In addition, the study relied solely on computer simulations without clinical validation, and certain assumptions and simplifications were made in both the model and calculations. Moreover, the surgical risks and long-term effects were not comprehensively assessed. Further research with a larger sample size is needed to validate the findings and optimise the model to bridge the gap between the potential of this technology and its clinical implementation."
