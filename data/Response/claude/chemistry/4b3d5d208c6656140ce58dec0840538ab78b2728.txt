 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Further optimize CAPP operating parameters (voltage, gas flow, treatment time, distance, etc.) to improve antibiotic residue removal efficiency in complex matrices like milk. 

2. Conduct toxicity studies on a wider range of CAPP-treated antibiotic residues using additional cell lines or model organisms to confirm lack of increased toxicity.

3. Evaluate the efficacy of integrating CAPP treatment into existing wastewater treatment infrastructure to mitigate antibiotic release into the environment.

4. Investigate CAPP treatment of a broader range of antibiotic classes and drug residues beyond Î²-lactams.

5. Explore combining CAPP with other advanced oxidation processes (e.g. UV, ozone) for synergistic degradation of antibiotic residues.
