E-mail: fabio@ic.uff.br. \u00a7E-mail: tondato@mate.unlp.edu.ar.\ngraph convexity is defined over a path system; the monophonic convexity [7, 11] consists of all the monophonically convex sets of V (G) (a set S is monophonically convex if and only if every induced path between two vertices of S lies entirely in the subgraph induced by S). Likewise, the geodesic convexity [18], the m3-convexity [9], the toll convexity [2], and the weakly toll convexity [6] are defined over shortest paths, induced paths of length at least three, tolled walks, and weakly toll walks, respectively.\nIn this work, we consider the weakly toll convexity, a variation of the toll convexity. Given distinct and nonadjacent vertices u and v of a graph G, a weakly toll (u, v)-walk is a walk u0u1 . . . uk\u22121uk such that u = u0, v = uk, and the following conditions hold:\n\u2022 u0ui \u2208 E(G) implies ui = u1;\n\u2022 uiuk \u2208 E(G) implies ui = uk\u22121.\nIn other words, u0 (resp., uk) has only one neighbor in the walk: vertex u1 (resp., uk\u22121), which can appear more than once in the walk.\nThe concept of weakly toll walk is a relaxation of the concept of tolled walk [2], defined to capture the structure of the convex geometry associated with an interval graph (for the concept of convex geometry, we refer the reader to [12]). Analogously, weakly toll walks are used to characterize proper interval graphs as convex geometries (see [6]). In addition to interval and proper interval graphs, other important classes of graphs have been characterized as convex geometries. Chordal and Ptolemaic graphs are convex geometries with respect to the monophonic and the geodesic convexities, respectively [12]; and weak polarizable graphs [17] are convex geometries with respect to the m3-convexity [9]. Other classes of graphs that have been characterized as convex geometries are forests, cographs, bipartite graphs, and planar graphs [3].\nThe weakly toll interval of a set S \u2286 V (G), denoted by I(S), is formed by S and the vertices belonging to some weakly toll walk between two vertices of S. We say that S is a weakly toll interval set if I(S) = V (G), and that S is weakly toll convex if S = I(S). The weakly toll convex hull of S, denoted by H(S), is the minimum weakly toll convex set containing S. We say that S is a weakly toll hull set if H(S) = V (G). The weakly toll interval number of G is the minimum cardinality of a weakly toll interval set of G; the weakly toll hull number of G is the minimum cardinality of a weakly toll hull set of G; and the weakly toll convexity number of G, denoted by wtc(G), is the size of a maximum weakly toll convex set of G distinct from V (G).\nIn [6], some invariants associated with the weakly toll convexity are studied; namely, the weakly interval number and the weakly hull number of trees and interval graphs are determined. In this work, we study the weakly toll hull, weakly toll interval, and weakly toll convexity numbers of general graphs. We remark that there are many studies on the invariants mentioned above, considering other types of graph convexities. The interested reader is referred, for instance, to [7, 18]. We draw attention to the fact that in many cases these three parameters are NP-complete even for special graph classes, as is the case for the hull number for partial cube graphs [1] and the interval number for chordal bipartite graphs [8] in the geodesic convexity.\nRegarding to the toll convexity, we cite [5, 10], where the hull and interval numbers have been investigated.\nThe remainder of this work is organized as follows. Section 2 contains all the necessary background. Section 3 presents some facts and complexity aspects on weakly toll convex sets and extreme vertices. In Section 4, we prove that deciding if the weakly toll convexity number of a graph G is at least k is NP-complete, even for prime graphs (G is a prime graph if it contains no clique separator). In Section 4, we show how to determine the weakly toll hull number of a graph; as in Section 3, concepts on decompositions by clique separators are used as a tool for this purpose. Section 5 is devoted to the determination of the weakly toll interval number. Finally, Section 6 contains our conclusions."

            "text": "We consider finite, simple and undirected graphs. Let G be a graph. For a set S \u2286 V (G), we denote by G[S] the subgraph of G induced by S. A vertex v \u2208 V (G) is a simplicial vertex if N(v) is a clique. We say that u and v are (true) twins if N [u] = N [v]. Denote by T (u) the set of vertices that are twins to u, and T [u] = T (u) \u222a {u}. Note that the vertices of G can be partitioned into sets T1, . . . , Tk such that for i \u2208 {1, . . . , k}, Ti = T [u] for some u \u2208 V (G). We call each set of this partition a class of twins of G and recall that this partition can be obtained in linear time using modular decomposition [4, 16]. Given a set S, we denote by S\u0302 the subset of S containing exactly one vertex of each class of twins having vertices in S.\nA path (resp., walk) between two vertices u, v \u2208 V (G) is called a (u, v)-path (resp., (u, v)walk). Let P = u0u1 . . . uk\u22121uk be a (u0, uk)-path. Given a set S \u2286 V (G), a path from u to S is a path from u to any vertex of S.\nA vertex x of a weakly toll convex set S \u2286 V (G) is called a weakly toll extreme vertex of S if S \\ {x} is also a weakly toll convex set. The set of weakly toll extreme vertices of S is denoted by ext(S). The set of weakly toll extreme vertices of V (G) is denoted by ext(G). In general, if C is a convexity on V (G) and S \u2208 C, a vertex x \u2208 S is an extreme vertex of S if S\\{x} is also convex. The convexity C is a convex geometry if it satisfies the Minkowski-Krein-Milman property [14]: Every convex set is the convex hull of its extreme vertices.\nFor convenience, when using the interval and hull operators for a given set, sometimes it will be useful to write the vertices of the set. For instance, we can write I(u, v) standing for I({u, v}).\nWe need some additional following definitions, that can be found in [15]. We say that S \u2282 V (G) separates u, v \u2208 V (G) if u and v are connected by a path in G but not in G \u2212 S. In addition, S is a separator of G if S separates some pair of vertices of G, and S is a clique separator of G if S is a separator of G and a clique. A graph G is reducible if it contains a clique separator, otherwise it is prime. A maximal prime subgraph of G, or mp-subgraph of G, is a maximal induced subgraph of G that is prime. Given an mp-subgraph M of G, we denote by \u2192 M the set formed by the vertices of V (M) that belong to at least two mp-subgraphs of G;\nand \u2190 M = V (M) \\ \u2192 M .\nAn mp-subgraph Mi of a reducible graph G is extremal if there is an mp-subgraph Mj 6= Mi for which the following property is valid: for every mp-subgraph Mk 6= Mi, it holds that V (Mi) \u2229 V (Mk) \u2286 V (Mi) \u2229 V (Mj). In this case, note that \u2192 Mi = V (Mi) \u2229 V (Mj).\nProposition 2.1. Let G be a graph with order n, size m and maximum degree \u2206. The following hold for distinct vertices u, v and w of G if uw /\u2208 E(G).\n1. Then, v lies in a weakly toll (u,w)-walk if and only if there exist vu \u2208 N(u) and vw \u2208 N(w)\nsuch that the graph G \u2212 S(vu, vw) contains a connected component C with {vu, vw, v} \u2286 V (C), where\nS(vu, vw) = (N [u] \\ {vu}) \u222a (N [w] \\ {vw}).\n2. Let u, v, w be three distinct vertices of a graph G such that uv /\u2208 E(G). Then, deciding\nwhether v lies in a weakly toll (u,w)-walk can be done in O(\u22062(m+ n)) time.\nProof. (1) Suppose that v lies in a weakly toll walk u, v1, v2, . . . , vk\u22121, vk, w. Let vu = v1 and vw = vk. Then vu \u2208 N(u) and vw \u2208 N(w). In addition, v1, v2, . . . , vk\u22121, vk is a walk that avoids all vertices in N [u] (except vu = v1) and all vertices in N [v] (except vw = vk). This implies that vu, vw and v lie in a same connected component of G\u2212 S(vu, vw).\nConversely, suppose that there is a pair of (not necessarily distinct) vertices vu \u2208 N(u) and vw \u2208 N(w) such that vu, vw and v lie in a same connected component C of G \u2212 S(vu, vw). Then, there is a walk W = v1, v2, . . . , vk\u22121, vk in C such that v1 = vu, vk = vw, and W contains v. (Possibly, vu and vw occur more than once in W .) In addition, W avoids all vertices in N [u] (except vu = v1) and all vertices in N [v] (except vw = vk). This implies that W \u2032 = u, v1, v2, . . . , vk\u22121, vk, w is a weakly toll walk containing v.\n(2) By Proposition 1, deciding whether v lies in a weakly toll (u,w)-walk amounts to checking whether there is pair vu, vw of neighbors of u and w, respectively, such that vu, vw and v lie in a same connected component C of G\u2212 S(vu, vw). Since there are at most \u2206 2 possible pairs vu, vw, and for each pair testing whether vu, vw, v lie in a component of G \u2212 S(vu, vw) can be done in O(n+m) time, the result does follow.\nFrom the above proposition and the definitions given in the previous section, we can easily\nderive the following fact.\nCorollary 2.2. Given a set of vertices S of a graph G with order n, size m and maximum degree \u2206, I(S) and H(S) can be computed in O(\u22062|S|2(n\u2212 |S|)(n+m)) and O(\u22062n4(n+m))\nsteps, respectively."

We start by showing that the Clique Problem is NP-complete even when restricted to prime graphs.\nTheorem 3.1. Let G be a prime graph and k a positive integer. Then the problem of deciding whether G contains a clique of size at least k is NP-complete.\nProof. The problem is clearly in NP. The hardness proof is a reduction from the Clique Problem [13]. Let (G, k) be an input of the Clique Problem. Set k\u2032 = k and construct a graph G\u2032 as follows:\nV (G\u2032) = V (G) \u222a {xuv | u, v \u2208 V (G), uv /\u2208 E(G)}\nand\nE(G\u2032) = E(G) \u222a {uxuv, v xuv | u, v \u2208 V (G), uv /\u2208 E(G)}.\nWe show that G\u2032 is a prime graph. Suppose not, and let C be a clique of G\u2032 that separates a, b \u2208 V (G\u2032).

Similarly, if b /\u2208 V (G), then there is a connected component Gb 6= Ga of G \u2032 \u2212 C containing a neighbor b\u2032 \u2208 V (G) of b. Thus, in any case, C separates two vertices a\u2032, b\u2032 \u2208 V (G). In addition, a\u2032b\u2032 /\u2208 E(G), and this implies that xa\u2032b\u2032 \u2208 V (G \u2032). Since xa\u2032b\u2032 is adjacent only to a\u2032 and b\u2032, it follows that xa\u2032b\u2032 /\u2208 C and G \u2032 \u2212C contains the path a\u2032 xa\u2032b\u2032 b \u2032, a contradiction. Therefore, G\u2032 is a prime graph.\nTo conclude the proof, we have that G\u2032 contains a clique of size at least k\u2032 if and only if G contains a clique of size at least k because we can assume that |V (G)| \u2265 2 and the maximum clique containing a vertex of V (G\u2032) \\ V (G) has 2 vertices.\nThe next theorem shows that the problem of deciding if the weakly toll convexity number\nof a graph G is at least k is NP-complete even when G is a prime graph.\nCorollary 3.2. Let G be a prime graph and k a positive integer. Then, the problem of deciding whether wtc(G) \u2265 k is NP-complete.\nProof. Given a set S \u2286 V (G) with |S| \u2265 k, by Corollary 2.2, we can check if S is weakly toll convex in polynomial time. Thus the problem is in NP.\nBy Corollary 5.2, if a graph G is prime but not complete, then every weakly toll convex set different of V (G) is a clique. Therefore, the hardness proof follows from the fact that the Clique problem restricted to prime graphs is NP-complete (Theorem 3.1)."

            "text": "In this section, we show how to compute wtn(G) for any graph G in polynomial time.\nTheorem 4.1. Let G be a non-complete connected graph and let u, v \u2208 V (G) satisfying |I(u, v)| \u2265 |I(w, z)| for any w, z \u2208 V (G). The following sentences hold.\n(i) If u, v /\u2208 ext(G), then wtn(G) \u2264 8.\n(ii) If u \u2208 ext(G) and v /\u2208 ext(G), then |T [u]|+ 1 \u2264 wtn(G) \u2264 |T [u]|+ 5.\n(iii) If u, v \u2208 ext(G), then |T [u] \u222a T [v]| \u2264 wtn(G) \u2264 |T [u] \u222a T [v]|+ 2.\n(iv) If w \u2208 ext(G), then w \u2208 T [u] \u222a T [v].\nProof. (i) to (iii) Since G is not complete, the choice of the pair {u, v} implies that uv /\u2208 E(G). Note that exactly one of (i) to (iii) holds for G depending on how many of u and v are weakly toll extreme vertices. If I(u, v) = V (G), then wtn(G) = 2, |T [u]| = 1 and |T [v]| = 1, which means that the result follows for any of the items (i) to (iii) that fits to G. Hence, we can assume that V (G) \\ I(u, v) 6= \u2205. Denote by Y the subset of V (G) \\ I(u, v) formed by the vertices containing neighbors in I(u, v), and write X = V (G) \\ (I(u, v) \u222a Y ). Since G is connected, there is y \u2208 Y . See Figure 1.\nWe claim that y \u2208 N(u) \u222a N(v). Supposing the contrary, let y\u2032 \u2208 I(u, v) be such that yy\u2032 \u2208 E(G) and let W be a weakly toll (u, v)-walk containing y\u2032. We can see W as the concatenation of two subwalks Wu and Wv, where Wu is a (u, y \u2032)-walk and Wv is a (v, y \u2032)-walk. Since WuyWv is a weakly toll (u, v)-walk containing y, we have a contradiction proving that the claim does hold.\nWe know that no vertex of Y belongs to N(u)\u2229N(v), because this was true for some vertex y, then uyv would be a weakly toll (u, v)-walk containing y and y would belong to I(u, v). Hence, we can write Y = Yu \u222a Yv such that Yu \u2229 Yv = \u2205 where Yu \u2286 N(u) and Yv \u2286 N(v).\nNow, we show that X = \u2205. Then, suppose that there is x \u2208 X. If Yu \u222a {u} separates x from v, then, by the above claim, there is an (x, u)-path contains exactly one vertex of Yu and none of N [v]. Such path can be used to show that I(u, v) \u2282 I(x, v), which is not possible by\nthe choice of {u, v}. Therefore, by symmetry, there are paths Pu and Pv from x to u and from x to v, respectively, such that Pu contains exactly one vertex of Yu and none of N [v], while Pv contains exactly one vertex of Yv and none of N [u]. Notice that these two paths form a weakly toll (u, v)-walk containing x, which is not possible. Hence, X = \u2205 and V (G) \\ I(u, v) = Y . Write Zu = Yu \\ T [u]. See Figure 2.\nWe claim that every u\u2032 \u2208 Zu has a neighbor in I(u, v)\\N [u]. Suppose by contradiction that u\u2032 has no neighbors in I(u, v) \\N [u]. We will show that I(u\u2032, v) has more vertices than I(u, v). It suffices to show that for every w \u2208 I(u, v), there is a weakly toll (u\u2032, v)-walk containing w. Let W be a weakly toll (u, v)-walk containing w, let u\u2217 be the only neighbor of u in W , and denote by W \u2032 the walk obtained from W by deleting w. If u\u2032u\u2217 \u2208 E(G), then u\u2032W \u2032 is a weakly toll (u\u2032, v)-walk containing w. If u\u2032u\u2217 6\u2208 E(G), then u\u2032W is a weakly toll (u\u2032, v)-walk containing w. Since u\u2032 \u2208 I(u\u2032, v) \\ I(u, v), we have that I(u\u2032, v) has more vertices than I(u, v), which is a contradiction and the claim does hold.\nDenote by Ru the subset of I(u, v)\\N [u] formed by the vertices having neighbors in Zu. By the above claim, Ru 6= \u2205. We have that Qu = N(u) \u2229 I(u, v) separates the vertices of Ru from v, because otherwise some vertex of Zu would belong to I(u, v). Now, let r \u2208 Ru. See Figure 3.\nWe claim that Zu \u2282 I(r, u, v). Let z \u2208 Zu. For the case where rz \u2208 E(G), it holds that z \u2208 I(r, u). Then, we can assume that rz 6\u2208 E(G). Let G\u2032 be the subgraph of G induced by I(u, v). Let Pr be a minimum path of G \u2032 from r to Qu. Denote by q the only vertex of Pr belonging to Qu. If qv \u2208 E(G), then let Pv = vq. Otherwise, let Pv be a minimum path of G\u2032 from v to Qu. Paths Pr and Pv exist because G \u2032 is connected. Let q\u2032 be the only vertex of Pv belonging to Qu, which can be equal to q. Furthermore, since Qu separates Ru from v, the intersection of Pr and Pv has at most one vertex. Now, the walk PruzuPv is a weakly toll (r, v)-walk containing z, completing the proof of this claim.\nFinally, define Rv relative to v as Ru has been defined to u, and note that every vertex of G belongs to exactly one of the sets I(u, v), T (u), T (v), Zu and Zv. We consider three cases depending on whether the vertices of T (u) and T (v) are weakly toll extreme or not.\nThe first possibility is when no vertex of T [u]\u222aT [v] is extreme. We will show eight vertices, not necessarily different, such that every vertex of G belongs to the interval of a subset of these vertices. Since the vertices of T [u]\u222aT [v] are not extreme, there are two vertices w1, w2 such that T [u] \u2282 I(w1, w2), and there are two vertices w3, w4 such that T [v] \u2282 I(w3, w4). We know that there is ru \u2208 Ru such that Zu \u2282 I(u, v, ru) and that there is rv \u2208 Rv such that Zv \u2282 I(u, v, rv). Therefore, {u, v, w1, . . . , w4, ru, rv} is a weakly toll interval set of G with at most 8 vertices. Therefore, (i) does hold.\nThe second case is when exactly one of the sets T [u] and T [v] is formed by weakly toll extreme vertices. By symmetry, we can assume that T [u] \u2286 ext(G) and that T [v]\u2229ext(G) = \u2205. Using the vertices of the previous case, we can conclude that T [u]\u222a{v,w1, w2, ru, rv} is a weakly toll interval set of G with at least |T [u]|+1 vertices and at most |T [u]|+5 vertices, which means that (ii) holds.\nIn the last case, i.e., when both T [u] and T [v] are formed by weakly toll extreme vertices, we have that T [u]\u222a T [v]\u222a{ru, rv} is an interval set of G with at least |T [u]\u222aT [v]| vertices and at most |T [u] \u222a T [v]|+ 2 vertices. Hence, (iii) does hold.\n(iv) Consider that partition I(u, v), T (u), T (v), Zu and Zv of V (G) constructed above. We have shown that Zu \u2282 I(u, v, ru) and Zv \u2282 I(u, v, rv), which means that the vertices of (I(u, v) \u222a Zu\u222aZv)\\{u, v} are not weakly toll extreme vertices of G. Therefore, ext(G) \u2286 T [u]\u222aT [v].\nThe following result is a consequence of Theorem 4.1 (iv).\nCorollary 4.2. For any graph G, at most 2 classes of twins of G are formed by weakly toll\nextreme vertices.\nTheorem 4.1 leads to the following algorithm for finding a minimum weakly toll interval set\nof a general graph G.\n\u2022 It begins determining the classes of twins T1, . . . , Tk of G that are toll extreme vertices.\nCorollary (4.2), we know that k \u2264 2.\n\u2022 If k = 0, then, by Theorem 4.1 (i), wtn(G) \u2264 8. Then, a minimum weakly toll interval\nset of G can be computed in O(n8\u03b1), where \u03b1 is the time complexity for computing the weakly toll interval of a given set.\n\u2022 If k = 1, then Theorem 4.1 (ii) guarantees that |T [u]|+1 \u2264 wtn(G) \u2264 |T [u]|+5 where T [u]\nis the only class of twins of G formed by weakly toll extreme vertices. Then, a minimum weakly toll interval set of G can be computed in O(n5\u03b1).\n\u2022 If k = 2, then, using Theorem 4.1 (iii), we have that |T [u] \u222a T [v]| \u2264 wtn(G) \u2264 |T [u] \u222a\nT [v]| + 2, where T [u] and T [v] are the only classes of twins of G formed by weakly toll extreme vertices. In this case, a minimum weakly toll interval set of G can be computed in O(n2\u03b1).\nCorollary 4.3. Given a general graph G of order n, size m and maximum degree \u2206, a minimum weakly toll interval set S of G can be computed in O(n9\u22062(n+m)) steps. Furthermore, |S\u0302| \u2264 8.\nProof. The time complexity, given in Corollary 2.2, for computing the weakly toll interval of a set S is O(\u22062|S|2(n \u2212 |S|)(n + m)). Note that I(S) = S \u222a I(S\u0302). Note also that for any set S considered in the above algorithm, |S\u0302| \u2264 8, resulting in a total time complexity O(n9\u22062(n +m))."

As observed in Corollary 4.3, |S\u0302| \u2264 8. Since wth(G\u2032) \u2264 wtn(G\u2032) for any graph G\u2032, we conclude that |R\u0302| \u2264 8. Therefore, using Corollary 2.2, one can compute wth(G) in O(n12\u22062(n +m)) steps. In this section, we present an algorithm with time complexity O(n2\u22062(n+m)) for computing wth(G). The case where G is a prime graph follows from the following known result and the fact that every induced path is a weakly toll walk.\nLemma 5.1. [7] If G is prime that is not complete, then every pair u, v of non-adjacent vertices of G is a monophonic hull set of G.\nCorollary 5.2. If G is a prime graph that is not complete, then every pair of non-adjacent vertices of G is a weakly toll hull set of G.\nFor the case where G is not a prime graph, we need of some auxiliary results.\nLemma 5.3. [15] Let Mi and Mj be two mp-subgraphs of a graph G. If V (Mi)\u2229 V (Mj) is not empty, then it is a clique. Lemma 5.4. Let G be a reducible graph and let M be an extremal mp-subgraph of G. If \u2190 M is not a clique, then there exist non-adjacent vertices u0, u1 \u2208 \u2190 M , a vertex w0 \u2208 \u2192 M , and an induced path P such that either P = u0w0u1 or P = u0w0w1u1 for some w1 \u2208 \u2192 M .\nProof. Let S = {u \u2208 V (Mi) \\ Ci : u has at least one neighbor in Ci}. If (V (Mi) \\ Ci) \\ S = \u2205, then, since V (Mi)\\Ci is not a clique, S is not a clique. If (V (Mi)\\Ci)\\S 6= \u2205, then S separates some vertex x \u2208 (V (Mi) \\ Ci) \\ S from some vertex y \u2208 Ci. Thus, S is not a clique because Mi contains no clique separator. From the above arguments, there exist nonadjacent vertices u0, u1 \u2208 S. If u0, u1 have a common neighbor w0 \u2208 Ci, then the lemma follows. Otherwise, let wj \u2208 Ci be a neighbor of uj , for j \u2208 {0, 1}, and consider the induced path P = u0w0w1u1.\nLemma 5.5. [15] Every reducible graph has at least two extremal mp-subgraphs.\nLemma 5.6. Let M1 and M2 be distinct extremal mp-subgraphs of a graph G. If u1 \u2208 \u2190 M1 and u2 \u2208 \u2190 M2, then V (G) \\ ( \u2190 M1 \u222a \u2190 M2) \u2282 H(u1, u2).\nProof. Let v \u2208 V (G) \\ ( \u2190 M1 \u222a \u2190\nM2). Let P1 be a (u1, v)-path containing only one vertex v1 of \u2192\nM1 and containing the minimum number of vertices of \u2192 M2. Let P2 be a (u2, v)-path containing only one vertex v2 of \u2192 M2 and containing the minimum number of vertices of \u2192 M1. If P1 has exactly one vertex of \u2192\nM2, we can assume that such vertex is v2. Analogously, if P2 has exactly\none vertex of \u2192\nM1, we can assume that such vertex is v1. Therefore, if P1 has at most one vertex\nof \u2192 M2 and P2 has at most one vertex of \u2192 M1, the concatenation of P1 and P2 is a weakly toll (u1, u2)-walk containing v.\nHence, since \u2192\nM2 is a clique, we can assume, without loss of generality, that P1 has exactly\ntwo vertices of v2, v \u2032 2 of \u2192 M2. Assume that v2 is between u1 and v \u2032 2 in P1. Let M \u2032 2 be an extremal mp-subgraph of G such that \u2192\nM2 \u2286 V (M \u2032 2 ). By the choice of P1, we have that v \u2032 2 /\u2208 V (M1),\nwhich means that M \u2032 2 6= M1.\nWe claim that v1 does not belong to V (M \u2032 2 ). Then, suppose by contradiction that v1 \u2208\nV (M \u2032 2 ). Since M \u2032 2 is an mp-subgraph, we know that v2 does not separate v1 from v \u2032 2 . Then, there is a (v1, v \u2032 2 )-path P \u2032 1 in M \u2032 2 \u2212v2. By the choice of P1, we have that P \u2032 1 has also two vertices of \u2192\nM2, v \u2032 2 and a vertex v\u2032\u2032 2 . Analogously, {v2, v \u2032\u2032 2 } does not separate v1 from v \u2032 2 . However, this\nimplies that \u2192\nM2 is an infinite set which is a contradiction, which means that the claim does\nhold.\nLet w1 be a vertex of V (M \u2032 2 )\\ \u2192 M2 that is neighbor of v2 in G, and let W be a closed (w1, w1)-\nwalk of M \u2032 2 \\ \u2192 M2 containing all vertices of V (M \u2032 2 ) \\ \u2192 M2. Using W , P1(u1, v2) and a (u2, v2)-path of M2 containing only one vertex of \u2192 M2, we conclude that V (M \u2032 2 ) \u2282 H(u1, u2).\nLet w2 be a neighbor of v \u2032 2 in G that belongs to M \u2032 2 \u2212 \u2192 M2. Finally, the walk formed by w2v \u2032 2\nand P2 is a weakly toll containing v, completing the proof.\nTheorem 5.7. The following hold for a graph G of order n.\n(1) wth(G) = n if G is a complete graph.\n(2) wth(G) = 2 if\n(a) If G is a non-complete prime graph, or.\n(b) G contains at least three extremal mp-subgraphs, or.\n(c) G is reducible and Mi is an extremal mp-subgraph of G such that \u2190 Mi is not a clique.\n(3) wth(G) \u2208 {2, x1 + 1, x2 + 1, x1 + x2}, where xi = | \u2190 Mi| for i \u2208 {1, 2} if G contains exactly\ntwo extremal mp-subgraphs M1 and M2.\nProof. (1) In a complete graph, no vertex can be an internal vertex of a weakly toll walk. Thus, wth(G) = n.\n(2a) It follows from Corollary 5.2.\n(2b) Let M1,M2 and M3 be three extremal mp-subgraphs of G. Let ui \u2208 \u2190 Mi for i \u2208 {1, 2, 3}. By Lemma 5.6, we have that V (G)\\( \u2190 Mi\u222a \u2190\nMj) \u2282 H(ui, uj) for any distinct i, j \u2208 {1, 2, 3}. Since \u2190\nMk \u2282 V (G) \\ ( \u2190 Mi \u222a \u2190 Mj), for {i, j, k} = {1, 2, 3}, we have that {u1, u2} is a weakly toll hull set of G.\n(2c) By Lemma 5.4, there exist non-adjacent vertices u0, u1 \u2208 \u2190 Mi, w0 \u2208 \u2192 Mi, and an induced path P such that either P = u0w0u1 or P = u0w0w1u1 for some w1 \u2208 \u2192 Mi. By Corollary 5.2, V (Mi) \u2286 H(u0, u1). Now, let G \u2032 be the connected component of G\u2212V (Mi) containing V (Mj)\\\n\u2192 Mi, where Mj 6= Mi is an mp-subgraph of G containing \u2192 Mi. The definition of mp-subgraph implies that w0 has a neighbor v \u2208 (V (Mj) \\ \u2192 Mi) \u2286 V (G \u2032). In addition, there exists a closed walk Wv in G \u2032 starting and ending at v such that Wv contains all vertices of G \u2032. Hence, either u0w0Wvw0u1 or u0w0Wvw0w1u1 is a weakly toll walk containing all vertices of G \u2032, i.e., V (G\u2032) \u2286 I(u0, u1) \u2286 H(u0, u1).\nNext, let G\u2032\u2032 be another connected component of G \u2212 V (Mi) distinct from G \u2032 containing\nvertices of an mp-subgraph Mk of G such that C \u2032 i = V (Mi) \u2229 V (Mk) 6= \u2205, and let w \u2208 C \u2032 i. Note that w has neighbors b1 \u2208 \u2190 Mi, b2 \u2208 V (Mj) \\ \u2192 Mi and y \u2208 (V (Mk) \\ C \u2032 i) \u2286 V (G \u2032\u2032). Also, there exists a closed walk Wy in G \u2032\u2032 starting and ending at y such that Wy contains all vertices of G\u2032\u2032, implying that b1wWywb2 is a weakly toll walk containing all vertices of G \u2032\u2032, i.e., V (G\u2032\u2032) \u2286 I(b1, b2) \u2286 H(u0, u1) because we know that b1, b2 \u2208 H(u0, u1). In conclusion, {u0, u1} is a weakly toll hull set of G and wth(G) = 2.\n(3) By (2c), we can assume that \u2190 M1 and \u2190 M2 are cliques. For i \u2208 {1, 2}, ifMi is a complete graph, choose ui as any vertex of \u2190 Mi; otherwise, choose ui as a vertex of \u2190\nMi having a non-neighbor in \u2192\nMi. By Lemma 5.6, V (G) \\ ( \u2190 M1 \u222a \u2190 M2) \u2282 H(u1, u2).\nNote that if M1 is not a complete graph, i.e., there is a pair u, v \u2208 V (M1) such that uv 6\u2208 E(G), then there is other pair u\u2032, v\u2032 \u2208 V (M1) such that u \u2032v\u2032 6\u2208 E(G) and {u, v} \u2229 {u, v\u2032} = \u2205. Indeed this hold because if this was not the case, then V (M1)\\{u, v} would be a clique separating u from v, which contradicts the assumption that M1 is an mp-subgraph. Note that this fact implies that if M1 is not a complete graph, then no vertex of Mi is an extreme vertex.\nWe have four cases to consider. In the first one, u1 and u2 are extreme vertices of G. By the above parapraph, we have that M1 and M2 are complete sets. Therefore, for i \u2208 {1, 2}, it\nholds T [ui] = \u2190 Mi. Since u1 and u2 are extreme vertices, then \u2190 M1 \u222a \u2190 M2 is a minimum weakly toll hull set of G and has size x1 + x2.\nIn the second case, u1 is an extreme vertex but u2 is not. Then, there are vertices v1, v2 \u2208 V (G) such that u2 \u2208 I(v1, v2). If M2 is a complete graph, then v1, v2 6\u2208 V (M2). Since M1 is a complete graph, at most one of v1 and v2 belongs to V (M1). If one of v1 and v2 belongs to V (M1), then we can assume that such vertex is u1. Since V (G) \\ ( \u2190 M1 \u222a \u2190 M2) \u2282 H(u1, u2), we have that \u2190 M2 \u2282 H(u1, u2). Since all vertices of \u2190 M1 are true twins, we have that the minimum weakly toll hull set of G has cardinality | \u2190\nM1|+1 = x1 +1. If M2 is not a complete graph, then\nu2 has a non-neighbor in \u2192 M2. Since \u2192 M2 \u2282 H(u1, u2), we have that \u2190 M1 \u222a {u2} is a weakly toll hull set of G. It is minimum because the assumption that u1 is an extreme vertex implies that all vertices of \u2190\nM1 are extreme vertices as well.\nThe third case, u2 is an extreme vertex but u1 is not, is analogue to the second case and we\nconclude that wth(G) = x2 + 1.\nIn the last case, both u1 and u2 are not extreme vertices of G. If M1 is not a complete graph,\nthen u1 has a non-neighbor in \u2192 M1. Then, the fact that V (G) \\ ( \u2190 M1 \u222a \u2190 M2) \u2282 H(u1, u2) implies that \u2190\nM1 \u2282 H(u1, u2). Since the same does hold for M2, it remains to consider that at least\none of M1 and M2 is a complete graph. Then, consider that M1 is a complete graph. Recall that there are vertices v1, v2 \u2208 V (G) such that u1 \u2208 I(v1, v2). Since M1 is a complete graph, v1, v2 /\u2208 V (M1). Since \u2190 M2 is a clique, at most one of v1 and v2 belongs to \u2190 M2. If one of v1 and v2 belongs to \u2190 M2, then we can assume that such vertex is u2. Since V (G)\\( \u2190 M1\u222a \u2190 M2) \u2282 H(u1, u2), we have that {u1, u2} is a weakly toll hull set of G.\nCorollary 5.8. Given a general graph G of order n, size m and maximum degree \u2206, wth(G) can be computed in O(n2\u22062(n+m)) steps.\nProof. Items (1) and (2a) of Theorem 5.7 consider the possibilites for a prime graph. Every graph that is not a prime graph falls in one of items (2c) to (2b) because every reducible graph has at least two extremal mp-subgraph by Lemma 5.5. We recall that the set of mp-subgraphs of G can be computed in O(nm) steps [15]. Items (2c) and (2b) can be easily teste in O(nm) steps. In item (3), we have to test whether a vertex is extreme. Using Corollary 2.2, this can be done in O(n2\u22062(n +m)) steps."

            "text": "Theorem 4.1 (iv) suggests that a set of weakly toll extreme vertices having no twins is an independent set. In the following result, we show that this fact holds on most of the wellstudied graph convexities. Recall the following convexities:\n\u2022 In the P3-convexity a set S is convex if for any two vertices x, y \u2208 S, any common neighbor\nto x and y is also in S.\n\u2022 In the induced P3-convexity a set S is convex if for any two nonadjacent vertices x, y \u2208 S,\nany common neighbor to x and y is also in S.\n\u2022 In the triangle path convexity a set S is convex if for any two vertices x, y \u2208 S, the vertices\nbelonging to any (x, y)-path containing whose chords only form triangles also belong to S.\n\u2022 In the \u2206-convexity a set S is convex if for any two adjacent vertices x, y \u2208 S, any common\nneighbor to x and y is also in S.\nProposition 6.1. Let G be a graph. In the geodesic, monophonic, P3, induced P3, triangle path, toll and weakly toll convexities, if S \u2286 ext(G) such that T (u) = \u2205 for every u \u2208 S, then S\nis an independent set.\nProof. Suppose by contradiction that u, v \u2208 S and uv \u2208 E(G). Without loss of generality, we can say that there is u\u2032 \u2208 N [u] \\N [v]. Note that u \u2208 I(u\u2032, v), which contradicts the assumption that u is an extreme vertex.\nFinally, we remark that the above result does not always hold in the m3-convexity and the\n\u2206-convexity."
