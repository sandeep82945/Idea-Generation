            "text": "Knowledge should be shared across organizations and disciplines to address today's societal challenges, such as climate change. Research collaboration and knowledge dissemination can be challenging, mainly when stakeholders include diverse organizations or disciplines. Can a role like a bridgebuilder be built to facilitate knowledge flow across different organizations and disciplines and remain understood throughout the flow? One of the responses is that the researchers who are being simultaneously engaged into two or more organizations (here I call these researchers multi-affiliated researchers) (European Science Foundation, 2013; YegrosYegros, Capponi & Frenken, 2021), who have shown a rising trend in science system in recent years (Hottenrott, Rose, & Lawson, 2021). Several studies discuss that these multi-affiliated researchers may act as bridging-person in collaborations by helping to sustain interactions between different organizations within a collaboration (European Science Foundation, 2013; Yegros-Yegros, Capponi & Frenken, 2021), as well as bring a positive effect of multiple affiliations associated with citations of publications (Hottenrott & Lawson, 2017, Huang & Chang, 2018; Sanfilippo, Hewitt, & Mackey, 2018).\nDespite the potential importance of these new roles in the research landscape, they still need to be explored, especially the behavior of these researchers, and the underlying strategic determinant from different countries or regions. In light of discussions about country differences in multiple affiliations (European Science Foundation, 2013; Hottenrott, Rose & Lawson, 2021), it can be initiatives designed to improve countries' competitiveness in international research, as well as a means of mobility to facilitate research collaboration. The national needs and implicit preference reflected behind them has not yet been explored. Here\nwe ask whether multi-affiliated researchers from different countries behave differently in different research fields and in their preference in choosing the host affiliation.\nTo this end, we compare multiple affiliation links of multi-affiliated authors from G7 and BRICS countries, based on their publications between 2017 and 2021, by Incites' citation topic classification system. More details can be found in the Data and Methods section. In addition, amidst the rapidly evolving landscape of the present day, characterized by events such as the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic, which emerged towards the end of 20191, and the China-US trade war leading to the breakdown of cooperation between the two of the largest research output producers over the world (Van Noorden, 2022), it is necessary to consider the challenges and potential strategies relevant to multi-affiliated researchers across nations. This study has been undertaken to answer the following three research questions: \u27a2 RQ1: What is the trend of multi-affiliated authors' research outputs during the COVID-19 pandemic period, and which types of authors are impacted more: those who have host\naffiliations within the same country, those with host affiliations abroad, or both?\n\u27a2 RQ2: How do multi-affiliated authors behave regarding research output across different countries, and what are the observed patterns in various disciplines? \u27a2 RQ3: Is there a preference in the choice of host affiliation among authors from different countries, and if so, how does this preference differ across countries broadly?\nThrough this research, we find that publications by multi-affiliated authors with multiple affiliations within-country/cross-country have shown different trends during the period of COVID-19 period, especially Chinese multi-affiliated authors have shown a relatively sharp decrease after 2018, the year of China-USA conflict erupted, which can also be seen in Van Noorden\u2019s study (2022). Multi-affiliated authors from G7 and BRICS countries show different activity across research fields. Moreover, by defining the home country and host country for such authors in multiple affiliation links, we find that authors from G7 and BRICS countries show different preferences in choosing their host-affiliated countries. Our study enriched explorations and explanations of multiple affiliations' underlying strategical needs and implicit preferences. These findings might further research to better understand the role of multiaffiliated researchers."

In contrast, three of the BRICS countries-South Africa, Brazil, and Russia, show an increase in the type of publications led by the international multi-affiliated authorship.

Discipline schema is one of them. We use Incites dataset without enough coverage of data from Art and humanities. Another is that we only analyze G7 and BRICS countries in this study. The multi-affiliated authorships of more countries with different strategic or economic status needs further investigation.
