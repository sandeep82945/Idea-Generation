    "abstractText": "The surface of metal mirrors is often polished by electroless coating with a Ni\u2013P modified layer after single-point diamond turning. In practice, however, improvements in mirror quality are closely related to the polishing environment, polishing medium, and polishing force. If not adequately controlled, processing defects such as visible scratches can lead to the deterioration of surface roughness. Based on the Ni\u2013P modified surface of a metal reflector mirror, this study optimizes the configuration of magnetorheological figuring (MRF) fluid and polishing process parameters so that MRF high-efficiency surface modification can be realized and the scratch problem can be resolved. The processing method of a high-performance metal mirror is developed by studying the high-efficiency and high-precision processing technology based on small head smoothing. The surface roughness achieved by the proposed method was better than Ra = 0.39 nm. The ultrasonic cleaning process effectively improved the surface roughness after processing. According to the combined processing technology developed in this study, the modified layer of the parabolic mirror with a diameter of 370 mm was processed, and the surface quality was increased from RMS = 338.684 nm to RMS = 21.267 nm.",

Introduction\nAluminum alloy materials are inexpensive, have low density and high strength, and are easy to process and manufacture. Metal mirrors are rarely used in visible or ultraviolet systems due to ultraprecision fabrication difficulties. The surface after singlepoint diamond turning (SPDT) can be directly used in the imaging applications of infrared optical systems [1,2]. However, the soft texture of the aluminum alloy surface and its susceptibility to scratching are also apparent, thus limiting its application in the visible light field. Modification on the substrate surface is a common method to improve the optical performance of the mirror surface [3,4]. Ni\u2013P alloys are an excellent modified layer material that is widely used in the aviation and defense industries [5,6]. Chemical coatings on Ni\u2013P alloys can improve the surface quality of mirrored substrates via surface modification and processing [7,8]. Ni\u2013P layers enable several processing techniques (e.g., SPDT, chemical mechanical polishing (CMP), magnetorheological finishing (MRF), and ion beam figuring) for reducing the roughness of the optical surface). After SPDT [9], the surface of the Ni\u2013P alloy modified layer can be optically polished to improve the surface quality and remove residual tool marks. The Ni-P layer is processed\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 560. https://doi.org/10.3390/mi13040560 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/micromachines\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 560 2 of 16\nusing SPDT with an accuracy of 60 nm in root mean square (RMS) analysis, and the surface roughness reaches Ra = 4.157 nm [10]. Kinast et al. polished Ni\u2013P alloy using aluminum 6061 as the experimental material matrix. After ultraprecision turning, a layer of electroless nickel coating was modified on the mirror surface, and the processing accuracy of optical elements was then improved by processing the nickel coating layer [11]. The results showed that the electroless Ni\u2013P modified layer was more uniform and had fewer surface defects compared with the electroplated nickel layer. A surface roughness of less than RMS = 1 nm was obtained [12]. Namba et al. studied the processing of Ni\u2013P alloy using CMP. Under controlled variables, a surface roughness of less than Ra = 0.3 nm was obtained by processing the material with nanosized silica polishing abrasive particles and flannel polishing disks [13]. Lei Hong et al. processed Al-based Ni\u2013P alloy by chemical mechanical polishing. The experimental workpiece was polished with silica polishing abrasive particles and ferric oxide ions as the oxidant [14\u201316]. A surface quality of Ra = 3.73 nm was obtained by processing SiO2/Fe2O3 composite abrasive particles on Ni\u2013P alloy materials, and a surface quality of Ra = 0.48 nm was obtained by using SiO2/CeO2 composite abrasive particles with a core-shell structure. Salleh Sideq compared the polishing performance of spherical and nonspherical colloidal silica abrasive particles in the Ni\u2013P alloy polishing experiment [17]. The results showed that the nonspherical colloidal silica abrasive particles did not produce defects on the surface of the workpiece and were superior to the spherical silica abrasive particles, leading to a surface quality of Ra = 0.756 nm. Zhang et al. developed a novel environment-friendly CMP slurry, consisting of silica, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), malic acid, and deionized water [18]. The surface roughness Ra and peak-to-valley (PV) values were 0.44 and 4.49 nm, respectively, with an area of 71 \u00b5m \u00d7 53 \u00b5m. An MRF process for the post-treatment of diamond turning is presented to remove the periodic microstructures and subsurface damages with improvement of the original figure and surface roughness by Jeon [19]. Aibo of Changchun University used MRF technology to polish aspheric mirrors with an aspheric aperture of 255 \u00d7 152 mm; the RMS value of the initial surface shape was 124.01 nm, and the RMS value of the finished surface shape was 15.19 nm. The residual lines after turning were removed, and the surface roughness was Ra 2.62 nm [20]. The experimental results indicated that MRF is suitable for removing periodic micropatterns caused during the SPDT process with the progress of the original figure and surface roughness. A variety of materials, such as Zerodur, plastics, and hard polycrystals, were examined before high-quality figuring and finishing very well with MRF [21,22]. However, investigations about the effect of MRF polishing fluids\u2019 composition on the Ni-P layer polishing performance, such as the material removal rate, surface roughness, and cleanliness, were rarely reported. The properties of the modified layer and the matrix are quite different due to the different material compositions. Furthermore, different proportions of nickel and phosphorus in the modified layer will also significantly change the properties of the modified layer, thus affecting physical properties, such as hardness, elastic modulus, and reflectivity, and in turn subsequent processing [12]. Therefore, it is critical to fully understand the surface characteristics of the modified layer. A suitable processing route should be studied according to surface characteristics. Otherwise, surface defects such as scratches will appear during processing of the modified layer, which reduce the strength and service life of the modified layer. Much research has been conducted on the polishing of the modified layer, but further research is needed on how to stably control scratches during processing, how to achieve high-precision and efficient processing on the modified surface of the metal mirror with a complex curved surface, and how to improve the surface roughness of the modified layer.\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 560 3 of 16\n2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Materials\nThe following materials were applied in this study: aluminum alloy (Microhension No. 6061/A96061) and nickel\u2013phosphorus alloy (Ni\u2013P) (the quality fraction of Ni was 87.5 wt%; the quality fraction of P was 12.5 wt%, manufactured by Guang Zhou Yi Shun Chemical Co., Ltd., Guang Zhou, China). The aluminum alloy was used as the base material of the workpiece, and the alloy Ni\u2013P was used as the surface coating layer. There were four kinds of abrasive particles: cerium oxide (CeO2), silicon dioxide (SiO2), alumina (Al2O3), and diamond (C). The nickel crystal has a face-centered cubic structure, 12 nickel atoms around each nickel atom. The existence of phosphorus in the modified layer will affect the grain size and thus the structure of the modified layer. In addition, different heat treatment processes will also affect the structure of the modified layer. Aluminum alloy is used as the base material of electroless nickel coating, and the zinc-dipping premodified layer method is a mature and reliable modification process [23\u201327]. Operational procedures include the formation of base parts, degreasing treatment, etching, zinc dipping, nitric acid stripping, secondary zinc-dipping treatment, alkaline condition chemical precoating, acidic condition chemical coating, baking, and analysis of finished products. In the subsequent modification process, the Ni\u2013P modified layer with excellent properties can be obtained by reasonably regulating the reaction conditions and rate according to the reaction mechanism. It should be noted that aluminum is an excellent material for nickel coating, and when the substrate is changed, the actual process will also have significant problems. Therefore, it is necessary to improve that plate process to obtain an excellent modified layer. Furthermore, we should pay attention to the thickness of the modified layer. When the modified layer is too thin, the modified layer will be damaged in the turning process and even seriously damage the diamond tool, which will bring significant problems to the subsequent processing.\n2.2. SPDT Turning Process of the Modified Layer\nThe unmodified surface is an aluminum alloy matrix with a soft texture. After processing, there are many impurities in the material due to the matrix itself, so random defects will appear after turning, as shown in Figure 1a. In contrast, the surface of the modified layer is better than that of the unmodified metal mirror because of uniform coating. Therefore, there are no random defects on the processed surface (Figure 1b). The total thickness of the modified layer is about 80\u2013100 \u00b5m, and the modified layer is damaged by the large removal amount, as shown in Figure 1c.\nMicromachines 2022, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 17\na complex curved surface, and how to improve the surface roughness of the modified layer.\n2.

SPDT Turning Proces of the odified Layer The un odifie f i alu inum alloy matrix with a soft texture. After processing, ther are many impurities in the material due to the matrix itself, s random defects will appear after turning, as shown in Figure 1a. In contrast, the surface of the modified layer is better than that of the un odified metal mirror because of uniform coating. Therefore, there are no random defects on the processed surface (Figure 1b). The total thickness of the modified layer is about 80\u2013100 \u03bcm, and the modified layer is damaged by the large re oval amount, as shown in Figure 1c.\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 560 4 of 16\nBoth the modified layer and the unmodified substrate have periodic lines after turning, and the reflection grating structure, such as periodic turning lines, will bring dispersion and ghosting problems to the mirror. Dispersion will cause the metal mirror surface to generate the \u201crainbow\u201d phenomenon after SPDT, which will affect the subsequent processing and the usage of a mirror. Problems such as dispersion and ghosting observed by naked eyes are caused by the optical characteristics of plane reflection grating. The plane reflection grating [28,29] is calculated by Equation (1):\nd(sin \u03b8i+ sin\u03b8m) =\u03bb, m= [\u00b1 (0, 1, 2, 3 . . . )] (1)\nwhere d is the grating constant, \u03b8m is the diffraction angle, \u03b8i is the incident angle, and m is the diffraction order. Different ultraprecision turning parameters will result in different surface shape errors of optical parts after processing. For the surface shape error, the traditional evaluation indexes mainly include PV and RMS values, but the error information contained in these indexes is quite limited. Power spectral density (PSD) can be used to evaluate the surface error and analyze the wavefront error information contained in the profile, especially the midhigh frequency error information. The one-dimensional PSD function is expressed by Equation (2) [30]:\nPSD( f ) = \u222b 2\u03c0\n0 PSD( fx, fy)d\n\u221a (cos \u03b8/Lx) 2 + (sin \u03b8/Ly) 2 (2)\nwhere Lx represents horizontal data sampling, Ly represents the data sampling length in the vertical direction, and the unit of a one-dimensional wavefront PSD function is nm3.\n2.3. MRF Process of the Modified Layer\nCerium oxide polishing powder is widely used in polishing, and the MRF fluid prepared by cerium oxide polishing powder has good properties and has a good effect on processing materials, such as fused silica and microcrystals. However, visible scratches will occur when processing the Ni\u2013P modified layer when cerium oxide polishing powder is used as abrasive particles to prepare MRF fluid. Cerium oxide is a rare-earth metal oxide and belongs to the cubic system with a polygonal structure. Cerium oxide is an excellent abrasive particle for its face-centered cubic structure, moderate crystal grain size, and three levels of edges and corners; the chemical and mechanical actions coincide in MRF. The surface quality is also good with the abrasive particle, but visible scratches are produced on the surface when processing the Ni\u2013P modified layer of the mirror, as shown in Figure 2 (VHX-600E Super Depth of Field Microscope manufactured by Keyence Corporation of Japan).\nMicromachines 2022, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 17\nFigure 1. Surface morphology after turning. (a) Substrate-turning lines. (b) Modified-layer-turning\nlines. (c) Modified-layer-turning damage.\nBoth the odifie l ified substrate have periodic lines after tur - ing, and the reflection grating structure, such as periodic turning lines, will bring dispersion and gh sting pr bl ms to the mirror. Dispersion will cause the metal mirror surface to generate the \u201crainbow\u201d phenomenon after SPDT, which will affect th subsequent processing and the usage of a mirror. Problem such as dispersion and ghosting observed by naked ey s are caused by the optical characteristics of plane reflection grating. The plane reflection grating [28,29] is calculated by Equation (1):\n(s in s i )= , = [ (0 ,1 , 2 ,3 ... )]i md m   (1)\nwhere d is the grating constant, \u03b8m is the diffraction angle, \u03b8i is the incident angle, and m is the diffraction order.

Noncontact cleaning methods, such as ultrasonic cleaning, are used in addition to the contact cleaning represented by deionized water and alcohol in daily use. The principle of ultrasonic cleaning is that ultrasonic waves vibrate the medium liquid, and energy is applied to the pollutant particles, as shown in the equation below; this energy plays a role in cleaning the workpiece [33].\n2 2\u221dW Af d (13)\nHere, f is the cleaning frequency, and d is the diameter of pollutant particles.

SPDT\nReflectivity is an important optical characteristic of optical elements and an evaluation index of its light transmission ability; the size is less than 1. The reflectivity changes with a different process. Besides the influence of the material itself, the surface microstructure will also lead to a loss of light energy and information. Generally, the deterioration of surface roughness is the leading cause of scattering loss. The sample turning parameters are shown in Table 1.\nFigure 5.

The principle of ultrasonic cleaning is that ultrasonic waves vibrate the medium liquid, and energy is applied to the pollutant particles, as shown in the equation below; this energy plays a role in cleaning the workpiece [33].\nW \u221d A f 2d2 (13)\nHere, f is the cleaning frequency, and d is the diameter of pollutant particles. The energy obtained by the polluta ts can vibrate away from t e surface of the aluminum mirror; larger p rticles lead to larger energy. This makes it easier to remove the pollutants on the surface of the aluminum mirror.\n3. Experiment 3.1. SPDT\nReflectivity is an important optical characteristic of optical elements and an evaluation index of its light transmission ability; the size is less than 1. The reflectivity changes with a different process. Besides the influence of the material itself, the surface microstructure will also lead to a loss of light energy and information. Generally, the deterioration of surface roughness is the leading cause of scattering loss. The sample turning parameters are shown in Table 1.\nThe instrument used here is a Hitachi U-4100 spectrophotometer (Tokyo, Japan) and is used to measure reflectivity. Figure 6 shows that its measurement range is 240\u20132600 nm. The sample mirror to be tested is placed on the stage in the sample bin with a reflection angle of \u03b8f. The stage and receiver are rotated with a reflection angle \u03b8f, and the energy signal of the sample is thus obtained. The metric monitored is the reflectivity of the sample at the reflection angle \u03b8f.\nMicromachines 2022, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 17\nThe instrument used here is a Hitachi U-4100 spectrophotometer (Tokyo, Japan) and is used to measure reflectivity.

MRF Analysis of the abovementioned double-edged circle model shows that the indentation depth \u03b4 will be in a smaller range when abrasive particles with higher hardness are used. Cerium oxide polishing powder has low hardness. To avoid scratches, it is necessary to reduce the rotating speed of the polishing wheel, which significantly influences MRF processing. Therefore, different polishing abrasive particles, such as silica, alumina, and diamond, were selected. The different abrasive particles are configured into MRF fluid to explore the possibility of MRF processing of the modified layer.\nMRF fluid plays a vital role in MRF, and its performance directly affects the success of the MRF process. Common polishing abrasive particles are cerium oxide, silicon dioxide, aluminum oxide, and diamond in the order of increasing hardness. Polishing abrasive particles with hardness higher than cerium oxide are used to configure the corresponding MRF fluid, and the modified layer is processed by MRF. When the hardness of polishing abrasive particles is increased, the pressing depth of abrasive particles on the machined surface can be relatively reduced under the condition of achieving the same shearing force. The result shows that abrasive particles with higher hardness will significantly suppress the scratch phenomenon that occurred before. The processed surface is shown in Figure 7.\nFigure 6.

CCOS The CCOS smoothing fluid can transport the smoothing abrasives during processing and take the products removed by smoothing away from the processing surface; thus, the fluid plays a specific cleaning role. In the configuration of smoothing fluid for the small head of a Ni\u2013P modified layer, the abrasive silica particles are usually spherical with a large specific area, low viscosity, good dispersibility, and easy cleaning. Moreover, the particle size can be controlled to the nanometer level, and it has better particle size dispersion than cerium oxide and aluminum oxide; thus, nanosilica is selected as the CCOSsmoothing abrasive.\nThe use of an oxidant can promote the chemical reaction during processing, and its selection standard is to make the removal process balance chemical and mechanical action. In the smoothing process, when the material removal amount is small, the surface quality after processing will be affected if the oxidant is too strong. Hydrogen peroxide is a suitable option, and it offers easy cleaning and is suitable for chemical mechanical smoothing. The generation of an oxidant is necessary. When no oxidant is used during processing, the smoothing abrasive particles are in direct contact with the surface of the modified layer, thus resulting in low smoothing removal efficiency and difficulty in improving the surface roughness.\nThe pH value of the smoothing fluid has a crucial influence on the quality after smoothing. Using sodium hydroxide fluid and organic acid to adjust the pH value of the fluid can inhibit the crystallization of abrasive silica particles in the smoothing fluid. However, complexation of metal ions and organic acid can improve the mechanical removal of materials. Component parameters of the smoothing fluid are shown in Table 2.\nAn asphalt-smoothing disk and configured smoothing fluid can smooth the modified layer with a small head.

During the smoothing process, the amount of processing removal should be focused to prevent the surface from being significantly degraded.\nThe above-mentioned combined processing technology can eliminate turning lines and obtain high-quality surface quality while performing high-precision deterministic modifications. If the turning surface accuracy does not meet the requirements, then repeated iterations of MRF-polishing can be performed. Similarly, if the CCOS process improves the surface roughness but does not meet the requirements, then an MRF iteration can be performed. Finally, the surface accuracy and surface quality can meet the requirements. The modified layer of the parabolic mirror with an aperture of 370 mm and a vertex curvature radius of R0 = 1/c = \u2212196.7 mm was processed. After coating and ultraprecision turning, the RMS of mirror surface reached 338.684 nm, and the parabolic reflector measurement result is shown in Figure 17a. After MRF polishing and processing, the surface accuracy of the parabolic mirror was increased from 1872.841 nm PV/338.684 nm RMS to 246.338 nm PV/21.267 nm RMS; the surface roughness was 0.61 nm Ra. The physical processed parabolic mirror is shown in Figure 17c.\nMicromachines 2022, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 15 of 17\nachieved. During the smoothing process, the amount o processing removal should be focused to prevent the surface from being significantly degraded. The above-mentioned combined processing technology can eliminate turning lines\nand obtain high-quality surface quality while performing high-precision deterministic modifications. If the turning surface accuracy does not meet the requirements, then repeated iterations of MRF-polishing can be performed. Similarly, if the CCOS process improves the surface roughness but does not meet the requirements, then an MRF iteration can be performed.

Conclusions This study examined a combined processing technology for ultraprecision machining of modified layers of metal mirror modified layers. The SPDT turning, MRF polishing, and CCOS smoothing techniques were used to improve the surface quality of ultraprecision machining of the modified layer of metal mirror. The initial surface shape and quality obtained by SPDT turning achieved a mirror effect, but after turning, the mirror surface formed periodic cutting lines, which were modified by MRF. Finally, a high surface quality was obtained by the CCOS smoothing process. With the proposed strategies, machining precision of metal mirror optics can be further improved, which will promote the application of metal mirror optics in visible light band as well as the application of SPDT turning, MRF polishing, and CCOS smoothing in the field of metal mirror optic fabrication.\nAuthor Contributions: H.H.: conceptualization, methodology, investigation, and formal analysis.
