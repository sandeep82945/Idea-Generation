    "abstractText": "In hospitalized populations, there is significant heterogeneity in patients\u2019 characteristics, disease severity, and treatment responses, which translates into different related outcomes and costs. Identifying inpatient clusters with similar clinical profiles could lead to better quality and personalized care while improving clinical resources used. Super-utilizers (SUs) are one such a group, who contribute a substantial proportion of health care costs and utilize a disproportionately high share of health care resources. This study uses cost, utilization metrics and clinical information to segment the population of patients (N=32,759) admitted to the University Hospitals of Geneva per year in 2017 2019. Using Latent Class Analysis it identifies 8 subgroups with highly similar patients demographics, medical conditions, types of service and costs within groups and which are highly different between groups. As such 82% of all SU patients, 99% of all patients less than 20 years old and 78% of all orthopedics patients are clustered into only 3 separate groups while one group contain only adult women 90% of them 20 to 40 years of age.",

            "text": "The ongoing increase in healthcare expenditures [1] and the introduction of new payment incentives which favor reductions in avoidable admissions and reoperations [2] are forcing hospitals to develop new quality improvement strategies and improve their efficiencies. Since the greater share of hospital expenditures is often directed toward a limited number of patients commonly referred in the literature as super-utilizers (SUs) [3], identifying these patients as well as other homogeneous subgroups of patients and designing better targeted interventions for them have the potential to increase appropriateness of care, improve outcomes and reduce costs.\nThis study first expands upon prior work [4] to stratify the population of patients admitted per year from 2017 to 2019 to the University Hospitals of Geneva (HUG) applying a proven cluster analysis algorithm [4] on utilization data using demographics, admission and medical data. Second, it identifies and assesses the structural stability of\n1 Corresponding Author, Gilles COHEN; E-mail: gilles.cohen@hcuge.ch\ninpatient subgroups at three different time points across the three years of hospitalization revealing similar clinical characteristics and patterns of care utilization.\nThe algorithm uses Latent Class Analysis (LCA) to identify patients\u2019 clusters within our inpatient data [4]. It is an iterative, maximum likelihood method that estimates how patterns in patient characteristics can be summarized into a finite number of groups, or latent classes, by producing a probability distribution over the cluster allocation for each patient. The present LCA analyses were not designed to track changes in inpatient class membership over time, but to examine whether certain patterns of hospitalized patients are consistent at different time points during hospitalization (i.e., structural stability)."

All data for the study were collected from the HUG Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW). The electronic medical record system provided clinical data while the accounting costing system provided financial data. Detailed admission data were gathered from hospital discharge summaries comprising admission and discharge dates, admission and discharge dispositions, lengths of stay (LOS), levels of care provided (standard care or intensive care), categories of services provided including surgical interventions, medications, tests, imaging and both primary and secondary diagnoses. The Elixhauser comorbidity index [5] was calculated for every admission using the International Classification of Diseases, Version 10 [6] using a coding algorithm. Diagnoses ICD-10 codes were matched with chapter headings and procedures codes were also reported. The top 10 percentile higher cost patients were identified based on their most expensive admission each year. For example, for the year 2019 we found that 90% of individuals (the least costly) accounted for only 58.5% of the total costs of the population while the remaining 10% of the population generated 41.5% of the total costs."

The basic latent class model [7,8] postulates that there are underlying (latent) subgroups in a population that cannot be seen straight away, but must be inferred from a multiplicity of observations. Let y j represent element j of a response pattern y. Let us establish an indicator function I(y j = r j) that equals 1 when the response to variable j = r j, and equals 0 otherwise. The probability of having a particular vector of responses is given as\n(1)\nwhere \u03b3c is the probability of membership in latent class c and is the probability of response r j to item j, conditional on membership in latent class c. The \u03b3 parameters represent a vector of latent class membership probabilities that sum to 1. The \u03c1 parameters represent a matrix of item-response probabilities conditional on latent class membership. Several criteria are available to determine from a set of models the best-fitting sub-class structure [9,10]."

The number of patients per group ranges from 2,848 to 4,969 with an average of 4,074 across the study time period. For every year group 1 has only women patients and group 2 has only single patients as illustrated in figure 1. Over the study period admissions to the HUG were done more via the emergency department (ED) for all the groups (55.8%) with groups 6, 7 and 8 at 91.1%, 91.3% and 93.6% respectively. Group 2 was the exception with only 321 patients out of 12,011 (2.7% ) admitted via the ED. These results are illustrated in figure 1. The patients\u2019 age showed a bimodal distribution with a first mode in the 0 to 18 age range (20.8%) and the second mode in the 75 and above age range (21.4%). Group 2 includes nearly only young patients less than 19 years of age (12,006 / 12,009). Group 7 has a majority (72.3%) of adults from age 75 and above.\nGroups 1 and 5 show a range of precisely targeted procedures (such as obstetric technics and operations on musculoskeletal system) and primary diagnoses (such as pregnancy and delivery and diseases of the musculoskeletal system) illustrated in figure 1 while group 2 shows no procedures done in all three years. In addition, group 4 shows more than one third of patients with diagnoses of tumors.\nThe Elixhauser comorbidity index was calculated for each patient based on their diagnosis codes. The distributions per group for chronic heart failure, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes do not show any significance difference across the groups.\nGroup 3 (N = 13,913) shows 63.8% of patients in the top 10 percentile for total costs.

            "text": "This study was conducted to determine whether a cluster grouping algorithm based on LCA clustering model could be applied to multiple years for the inpatient population of the HUG. The results show that the LCA clustering model is able to generate 8 groups with distinctive characteristics. In particular, the algorithm was able to identify a group with mostly patients less than 19 years of age who use the hospital for health related factors no hospitalizations for major conditions as well as a group with only women who are hospitalized for only women related procedures and diagnoses. A group of patients who most likely suffer from cancer related illnesses and a group of geriatric patients most likely suffering from multicomorbities and polypharmacy. Important among the 8 groups was the group of patients whose costs are in the top 10th percentile (Group 3) consistently for the 3 years and for whom the use of ambulatory and inpatient services is the greatest as well as the use of treatments, test (labs) and medications. Given the consistency of the results for these patients and the coherence we observed across the other groups (described above), we are confident that group 3 represents the SUs of care for the HUG in the years 2017 - 2019. Furthermore, the clustering method identifies 3 groups with highest yearly inpatient cost (including the SUs) whose revenues to expenses ratios were consistently in the 0.70 to 0.80 range for each year of study. Finally, across and among the groups the results for the variables studied are highly coherent demonstrating that the clustering algorithm is robust to stratify stable homogeneous populations for each year of the study. In this investigation, we extended the use of cluster analysis from our earlier work to identify distinct subgroups of patients across multiple years with specific combinations of co-occurring conditions in a large academic medical center. The model reveals highly stable expected segmentation by age brackets and gender such as with group 2 (patients less than 19 years of age) and group 1 (women only patients) along with the expected SUs care group 3. While the model appears coherent and robust to further assess the stability of these clusters over time, analyses should be conducted following a cohort of patients across multiple years. Such a study would provide additional characteristics of the groups we have identified such as for example when in time do patients move from one cluster to another, become SU of inpatient care, and what is their average yearly costs of care before and after they are identified as SUs.\nIn this study we showed how cluster analysis can be used to identify homogeneous groups of complex patients from a large heterogeneous population over a 3 years period. Such clustering method demonstrates that it is possible to use hospital inpatient data to systematically year after year identify homogenous grouping of patients with similar clinical and care utilization characteristics. Further studies in the work should also help us identify movements of patients across clusters across time. Recognizing and further studying these patterns of care usage would help hospitals design more personalized\npatient centered care management strategies to better meet the needs of our patients while optimizing the use of our limited resources and controlling costs."
