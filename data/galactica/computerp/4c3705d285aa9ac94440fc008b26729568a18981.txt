We propose a novel image registration method based on implicit neural representations that addresses the challenging problem of registering a pair of brain images with similar anatomical structures, but where one image contains additional features or artifacts that are not present in the other image. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we use 2D microscopy in situ hybridization gene expression images of the marmoset brain. Accurately quantifying gene expression requires image registration to a brain template, which is difficult due to the diversity of patterns causing variations in visible anatomical brain structures. Our approach uses implicit networks in combination with an image exclusion loss to jointly perform the registration and decompose the image into a support and residual image. The support image aligns well with the template, while the residual image captures individual image characteristics that diverge from the template. In experiments, our method provided excellent results and outperformed other registration techniques. 1 conclusion Our approach based on implicit networks and registration-guided image decomposition has demonstrated excellent performance for the challenging task of registering ISH gene expression images of the marmoset brain. The results show that our approach outperformed pairwise registration methods based on ANTs and SynthMorph CNN, highlighting the potential of INRs as versatile off-the-shelf tools for image registration. Moreover, the proposed registration-guided image decomposition mechanism not only improved the registration performance, but also could be used to effectively separate the patterns that diverge from the target fixed image.
