 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct a similar study on waiting list procedures at other universities to see if similar issues exist and if the proposed solution could work in those contexts as well. This would strengthen the external validity of the findings. 

2. Test the implementation of the automated student filtering program for waiting list handling. Evaluate its effectiveness and identify any new issues that arise.

3. Explore additional ways to increase transparency in the waiting list procedure, such as providing real-time waiting list status updates to students. 

4. Investigate the root causes behind high demand for certain courses that leads to long waiting lists. Develop interventions to better align course offerings with student demand.

5. Examine the impact of waiting lists on student satisfaction and academic performance. Identify any disparities among demographic groups.
