Initially,\nmost cases at the epicentre of the outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei province-China, had contact with live animals and seafood, suggesting animal to human transmission. As COVID-19 continues to rapidly spread throughout the world, the incidence varies greatly among different countries.\nThe devastating consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic have now surpassed 150 million infections and over 3 mil-\nlion deaths worldwide. Secondary health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are less clear, but they beginning to emerge as well [1]. COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 has evolved quickly around the globe, and the related socio-economic burden is high. Fortunately, less than 2% of COVID-19 cases are reported in paediatric patients, and they commonly show milder symptoms and a better prognosis than adults. Nevertheless, there is a general consensus regarding the role of young individuals in the spread of viral respiratory pathogens.\nSocial distancing, remote work, and virtual schooling have overturned families\u2019 daily interactions and schedules. Children are home more than usual, and parents are distracted trying to complete their daily tasks while managing the stressors of a global pandemic. Documented increases in domestic violence, child maltreatment and abuse, mental illness, and substance use as a consequences are well reported all over the world [2].\nThe current health emergency is characterized by multiple factors (distance, difficulty in traveling, decrease or loss of work, loss of a family member or loved one, symptoms related to the disease itself or to long-covid, etc.) and each person is likely to be more or less sensitive to each of these. It is hypothesized that people affected by one or more of these stressors, and especially if affected by what makes them vulnerable, may show signs of psychological distress.\nRecent research highlights both economic (e.g. loss of income and employment) and personal stressors faced by parents (e.g. fear of contracting the virus, experiencing illness and death of friends/family from the virus). Further, these stressors are associated with increased fatigue, anxiety, and depression, all correlating to increased injury risk for children [3].\nExperiences consistently indicate that quarantine has been important in reducing the incidence and mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. Early implementation of quarantine and combining quarantine with other public health measures is important to ensure effectiveness. However, these measures are related to some mental problems as well [4].\nWithout involving discussion about the characteristics of these new forms of the virus or the way of transmission, as well as about main symptoms of the infection and mortality rate, our purpose in this article is to analyse some aspects\nof mental health issues among the young population in our country in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMETHODOLOGY AND SAMPLE\nThe evaluated sample is made up 234 young people, from 15 to 30 years, mean age 22\u00b13.66 years, selected by chance. Our adapted questionnaire, containing different aspects of perceptions related to the pandemic, was distributed online by internet. The obtained results are presented in tables, graphs, or numerically and discussed. Finally, some conclusions and suggestions are proposed.\nRESULTS\nFrom a total 234 evaluated people, 73.5% were female, and 26.5% were male. Urban citizens were 88%, while those living in villager were 12%. Those living in individual houses were 42.7% while those who lived in apartments were 57.3%. Most of the young people, 85.5% lived with their parents, 6% with their partners, while about 2% lived in student housing and the rest, 6.5% selected the answer - 'other'.\nUniversity students were 81.6%, and those in their master studies followed with 4%, 11.1% are working, and high school students were 3.3%.\nFrom an economic point of view 84.6% of family members kept their jobs during pandemics, while 15.4% lost their jobs. Additionally, 33.3% answered that the pandemic negatively influenced their financial status, 36% answered that they had small economic consequences, and 31.6% answered that there has been no change in their finance stability.\nThe majority of examinees 93.2% brought up serious concerns about their own health, and 6.8% answered that they are not concerned. The answer about the possible danger to physical health related to the virus was positive for 80% of examinees, while 20% answered that they felt no danger. The perception about possible death was confirmed in 74% of examinees, while 26% answered negatively. However, 69.2%, mani-\nfested fear about possible infection, while 30.8% denied having any fear.\nIn this context, our interest was especially directed to the mental health issues related to this pandemic.\nThe next question was: \"Was your anxiety greater in the beginning of pandemic or now\" 61.5% answered that the anxiety they feel was greater at the beginning of the pandemic, 9% are more anxious now, 23.1% were equally anxious all of the time and 6.4% answered that they do not feel anxious at all. Fig. 1 shows answers about the places (conditions) of possible infection. It is impressing that public transport is perceived as the most dangerous place for infection.\nAs mentioned before, the WHO experience indicates that quarantine and some preventive measures are important to reduce the incidence and mortality rates during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe opinions about the necessity of preventive measures (masks and social distancing) were confirmed in 88.5%, while 9.5% answered negatively. Only 2% had no opinion. In the same context, 38.9% answered that they wash their hands more frequently during the pandemic, while the others have not changed their hand washing habits. Social distancing was confirmed in 20.9%, while 49.1% answered that they do it sometimes, but the examinees answered in the negative at the rate of 10.7%. However, 19.2% answered that they practically very rarely keep distance as a preventive measure.\nFor 53% of all examinees, the quarantine and lockdown provoked great frustration, while 47% were indifferent to these measures. In a similar context, in order to be informed about the spread of the infection, 37.6% followed weekly information about the number of positive cas-\nes, 13.2% followed this information every day, while 41.9% had no interest about the number of infected people.\nConcerning their own experience with the infection, 39.3% of young people confirmed having been infected, 45.7% were not infected, while 15% have no information about possible infections. The clinical expression of infected young people is presented on Figure 2.\nHowever, 73.5% had some contact with infected people, 15% answered with negative contact, while 11.5% were not be sure about possible contact.\nBecause young people have remained at home most of the time, the next question was about how they spent their time during curfew and lockdown (Fig 3).\nThe main dilemma regarded the expectation of the possible end of the pandemic. In this context, 29.9% of the people answered that it would all be finished by 2022, while 31.2%\nanswered negatively. The rest, 38.9%, answered that they have no opinion about the end of pandemic.\nHow will life continue after this health catastrophe was a very provocative question. 42 (3%) of examinees think that life will continue as before, and 24 (8% answered that it will never be the same, while 32,9% have not answer for this question.\nThe influence of the pandemic on mental health was confirmed in 78.2% of the young people, while 21.1% answered negatively. From the total positive answers, 38.9% confirmed that their mental health was disturbed very much, and in 50.3% it appeared to have changed moderately, while only 10.8% answered that only minimal problems were registered in their mental functioning.\nAs it is well known, in the academic years 2020-2022 schools and universities worked generally online. This type of education required internet access and having a computer at home. Therefore, those who had a good internet connection were at 82.1% of examinees, while 17.9% confirmed some problems with internet connections.\nFor humans, having a social life is a very important issue. For young people especially, friendships are a very important part in their life. During online lectures, the contact with friends was obviously changed. Related to this question, 50% of examinees answered that most of their friendships were practically stopped, 37.6 % confirmed not having any problems with their friends, while 12.4% answered that they were not sure about the quality of actual friendships. Surprisingly, 62.8% answered that they gained some new friendships during this pandemic, while 37.2% answered negatively.\nOnline education was differently evaluated by students: some of them appreciate this form of lectures because it allows them more possibility to copy, record, and review the lectures, if needed. They also have more time for themselves, giving them some flexibility. This diminished the risk of infection and also allowed them to plagiarize answers on the exams. However, for 24% of students, online education was not appropriate because technical problems, the disorganisation of teachers, less interaction, no practical experiences, and the lack of the ability to socialize.\nThe answers about the examinees feelings related to general health and especially to their mental status are displayed on Fig 4.\nLoneliness was the greatest problem in 55.6% of the examinees, 33.5% did not have this feeling, and 11.1% did not have any opinion about loneliness. To overcome loneliness, social media could of good help. In 85.9% of the examinees, social media helped to remain in contact with friends, and for 9.1% social media were not used for contacting friends. For the rest, 6%, the answer was: I don\u2019t know.\nGenerally, the overall pandemic conditions had a negative influence on the mental health for 78% of the evaluated young people, while for 22% there was no change in their mental functioning.\nDISCUSSION\nPsychological wellbeing is not a new topic in psychological research, especially in the social sciences in general. However, the current\nsituation due to the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically redirected the focus of researchers to the newest aspects and perspectives related to mental health and wellbeing of people.\nMost studies examining the impact of COVID-19 among paediatric populations have been focused on initial clinical presentation and symptoms, which happened to be similar to those in adult populations. In addition, COVID-19 has had a moderate impact on children and adolescents\u2019 social environment, which may exacerbate current and future physiological, psychological, behavioural, and academic outcomes.\nLong-term consequences for psychological functioning are still missing, but the shortterm consequences are not optimistic. Therefore, the WHO has warned that \"isolation, physical distancing, the closure of schools and workplaces are challenges that affect us, and it is natural to feel stress, anxiety, fear and loneliness at this time.\" [5]\nSpeaking at the World Economic Forum (April 2020), Dr. Elke Van Hoof pointed that lockdown is the world's biggest psychological experiment - and we will pay the price. She presented the graph of comparison the toxic stress in people in Belgium in 2019-2020 [6]\nAs all efforts are focused on understanding the epidemiology, clinical features, transmission patterns, and management of the COVID\u201019 outbreak, there has been very little concern expressed over the effects on mental health and on the strategies to prevent stigmatization. However, people\u2019s behaviour may greatly affect the pandemic's dynamic by altering the severity, transmission, disease flow, and repercussions. The current situation requires raising awareness in the public, something that can be helpful to deal with this calamity [7].\nA review published in The Lancet stated that the separation from loved ones, loss of freedom, boredom, and uncertainty can cause dete-\nrioration in an individual's mental health status [8]. To overcome this, measures at the individual and societal levels are required.\nUnder the current global situation, both children and adults are experiencing a mix of emotions. They can be placed in a situation or an environment that may be new and can be potentially damaging to their health. [9]\nFor the youth, staying away from their school, friends, and colleagues, and remaining at home can raise many further questions about the repercussions of the outbreak; they look toward their parents or caregivers to find answers. Not all children and parents respond to stress in the same way. Children can experience anxiety, distress, social isolation, and an abusive environment, all things that can have short\u2010 or long\u2010term effects on their mental health. Some common changes in children's behaviour can be: excessive crying and annoying behaviour, increased sadness, depression, or worry, difficulties with concentration and attention, changes in, or avoiding, activities that they enjoyed in the past, unexpected headaches and pain throughout their bodies and changes in eating habits.\nA recent study conducted by UNICEF and Gallup surveyed children and adults in 21 countries. The results showed that more than one-fifth of youth aged 15-24 years expressed feelings of depression or loss of interest in various activities. In our study we obtained similar results. A significant portion of children do not receive adequate mental health care, and the absence of a physical environment poses a risk for their mental health. This was confirmed in our country, as well [10].\nA study in Hubei province, China, examined 2,330 children and found that nearly a quarter reported experiencing depressive symptoms. A third of them reported feeling anxious.\nIn addition to affecting mental health, the coronavirus pandemic has also affected the development of children\u2019s brains. Children\u2019s brains begin developing during childhood, and the stress caused by the pandemic can affect their mental health. They may develop anxiety or depression if they are unable to deal with the stress and fear caused by the epidemic.\nIn this context, further studies are needed to identify the long-term effects of COVID-19 and to understand the effect of specific risk factors as they develop over time.\nAl-Rahamneh et al. [11] investigated the psychological impacts of COVID-19 on Jordanian children between the ages of 5\u201311 years old. A total of 1309 parents with children between the ages of 5 and 11 years old filled out an online survey that included a set of questions to measure their children\u2019s behaviour and emotions before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Being bored (77.5%), irritable (66%), likely to argue with the rest of the family (60.7%), nervous (54.8%), reluctant (54.2%), and lonely (52.4%) were the most frequently reported symptoms compared to the pre-COVID-19 period. Parents reported that screen use of \u2265120 min a day was shown among 48.9% of children and 42% of children partook in <30 min a day of physical activity. \u22648 h of sleep per night was reported among 42.5% of children compared to pre COVID-19 times. In our previous study [12] we confirmed similar problems. The results emphasized the importance of developing preventive psychological programs to minimize the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children\u2019s psychological well-being and long-term consequences [13, 14].\nCONCLUSION\nThe understanding of the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and coping mechanisms is very important for all ages, but especially for the developing young population.\nDepression, loneliness, anxiety, panic attacks, hopelessness, frustration, insomnia, eating problems, sadness, and emotional exhaustion are the most frequent manifestations of lockdown and quarantine. Online communication is the main cause of diminishing social relations.\nTo overcome the negative effects, we propose that families ensure enough time to be together, including children and adolescents, and to partake in some physical activities/sports. Accordingly, traditional and social manifestations must be excluded in order to prevent spreading the infection.\nInformation about mental health and suggestions about how to overcome the risks must be available to everyone. However, some professional assistance is a welcome suggestion for more affected youth.\nREFERENCES\n1. Roe, D., & Zane, D. (2021). COVID-19 + injury connections: A literature review.
