1. **Investigate the use of different pre-trained language models (PLMs) as the backbone for the cross-encoder.** The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the cross-encoder architecture with three different PLMs, but it would be interesting to see how other PLMs perform with this architecture. This could help identify the best PLM for code search tasks and provide insights into the factors that contribute to a PLM's performance in this domain.


2. **Explore the use of different negative sampling strategies for training the cross-encoder.** The paper proposes a probabilistic hard negative sampling method, but there may be other negative sampling strategies that could further improve the performance of the cross-encoder. For example, one could investigate the use of adaptive negative sampling, where the difficulty of the negative samples is adjusted based on the model's performance.


3. **Investigate the use of the cross-encoder architecture for other code-related tasks.** The paper focuses on the code search task, but the cross-encoder architecture could potentially be applied to other code-related tasks, such as code summarization, code generation, and code defect detection. It would be interesting to explore the performance of the cross-encoder on these tasks and identify the modifications that are necessary to adapt it to each task.


4. **Develop a better understanding of the factors that contribute to the performance of the cross-encoder.** The paper provides some insights into the factors that contribute to the performance of the cross-encoder, such as the number of retrieved codes and the difficulty of the negative samples. However, there may be other factors that also play a role, such as the hyperparameters of the model and the quality of the training data. A more thorough investigation of these factors could help improve the performance of the cross-encoder and provide guidance for future research in this area.


5. **Investigate the use of the cross-encoder architecture for other natural language processing (NLP) tasks.** The cross-encoder architecture is not limited to code search and could potentially be applied to other NLP tasks, such as question answering, machine translation, and text summarization. It would be interesting to explore the performance of the cross-encoder on these tasks and identify the modifications that are necessary to adapt it to each task.
