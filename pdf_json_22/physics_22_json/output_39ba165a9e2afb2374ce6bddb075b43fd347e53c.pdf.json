    "abstractText": "Fe-Si-Cr soft magnetic powder cores (SMCs), with high electrical resistivity, magnetic permeability, saturation magnetic induction, and good corrosion resistance, are widely applied to inductors, filters, choke coils, etc. However, with the development of electronic technology with high frequency and high power density, the relative decline in the magnetic properties limits the high-frequency application of SMCs. In this paper, the phosphating process and polyimide (PI) insulation coating is applied to Fe-Si-Cr SMCs to reduce the core loss, including hysteresis loss and eddy current loss. The microstructure and composition of Fe-Si-Cr powders were analyzed by SEM, XRD, and Fourier-transform infrared spectra, respectively. The structural characteristics of the Fe-Si-Cr @ phosphate layer @ PI layer core\u2013shell double coating were studied, and the best process parameters were determined through experiments. For SMCs with 0.4 wt% content of PI, the relative permeability is greater than 68%, and the core loss is the lowest, 7086 mW/cm3; annealed at 500 \u25e6C, the relative permeability is greater than 57%, and the core loss is the lowest, 6222 mW/cm3. A 0.4 wt% content of PI, annealed at 500 \u25e6C, exhibits the ideal magnetic properties: \u03bce = 47 H/m, P = 6222 mW/cm3.",

            "text": "Metal magnetic powder cores, belonging to a kind of soft magnetic composite material, are prepared by mixing ferromagnetic powder with an insulating medium [1]. They are commonly used in transformers, electronic communication, and radar due to the strengths of high saturation induction density, high magnetic permeability, and low total loss [2,3]. In recent years, Fe-Si-Cr SMCs, as new soft magnetic composite materials, have widely been applied to the inductance, filter, choking ring, and similar areas due to their higher electronic resistivity, permeability, and lower core loss in comparison with traditional silicon steel sheets, single-metal-based soft magnetic materials [4]. In high-frequency applications, adding Si can not only reduce the eddy current loss by increasing the resistivity of SMCs but also can form CrSi and CrSi2 in Fe-Si-Cr SMCs with excellent temperature characteristics [5]. The addition of Cr can improve the mechanical strength, plasticity, and corrosion resistance of SMCs [6]. Compared with other iron-based SMCs, Fe-Si-Cr SMCs offer better broadband response characteristics and lower cost. Unfortunately, the increment in core loss as a result of increased operating frequency limits the large application of Fe-Si-Cr SMCs [7]. To reduce core loss Pcv, including hysteresis loss Ph and eddy current loss Pe, insulating coating and high-pressure forming are usually applied in the manufacturing process [8\u201318]. Generally, there are two types of coatings used to suppress eddy currents: organic coatings and inorganic coatings [19]. With the advantages of satisfactory adhesion and flexibility, organic substances such as epoxy resin [20] or phenolic resin [21] have been used as the insulating layer of SMCs. Due to high dislocation density and defects, high pressure causes an increase in hysteresis loss Ph. In order to eliminate defects such as lattice strain, a\nMaterials 2022, 15, 3350. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma15093350 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2022, 15, 3350 2 of 14\nhigh-temperature annealing process is usually used. Some new characterization methods have promoted the study of SMCs [22\u201324]. However, the annealing process above 400 \u25e6C easily decomposes the organic resin [25]. Therefore, phosphate [26] and oxide [27,28] are used as the passivation layer of SMCs. However, the phosphate insulating layer will also collapse during the annealing process, resulting in a decrease in resistivity [26]. The organic coating has good adhesion but poor heat resistance. PI has higher heat resistance, insulation resistivity, and mechanical stability than ordinary resins, which is a potential organic coating material for magnetic powders. However, PI is a non-magnetic material; it can increase resistivity but decrease permeability [29]. To optimize the magnetic properties and reduce the core loss, high-temperature annealing is an effective method [30]. The process of preparing SMCs by powder metallurgy has been widely used to lower costs and improve efficiency [31,32]. This method is based on using each fine powder particle to make the insulating coating, which can significantly reduce the core loss of the SMCs. Therefore, the research on high-performance insulating coatings and coating methods for SMCs is currently a popular research subject [33]. Due to the excellent insulation performance of the organic coating but the decomposition temperature being low, it cannot be combined with subsequent high-temperature annealing treatment to eliminate the influence of residual stress during pressing. Therefore, the current research tends to use an inorganic coating to improve the annealing temperature [34]. There are few papers on the research of inorganic + organic double coating, especially research on using PI with high decomposition temperature as an organic coating. Although many inorganic materials also have excellent insulation properties and can significantly reduce eddy current loss, the compact density of inorganically coated SMCs is generally lower than that of those that are organically coated, so there will be defects, such as compact pores, which in turn affect magnetic properties, such as hysteresis loss. In this paper, to reduce the core loss of SMCs at high frequencies, an inorganic phosphate + organic PI double coating with excellent insulation performance was used to improve powder resistivity and reduce eddy current loss; the organic coating PI with a higher decomposition temperature was used to increase the compact density and increase the annealing temperature to reduce the hysteresis loss. Finally, higher magnetic properties can be obtained by annealing in an argon atmosphere at 500 \u25e6C for 1 h."

The preparation process of Fe-Si-Cr @ phosphate layer @ PI layer core\u2013shell double coating and SMCs is divided into three steps: phosphating, coating, and annealing, as shown in Figure 1. First, Fe-Si-Cr powders were pretreated with phosphate, as shown in Figure 1a. The phosphating procedure was carried out in 50 mL of acetone, mechanical stirring at room temperature for one hour followed by drying at 80 \u25e6C for one hour. Secondly, we prepared PI coating, as shown in Figure 1b. The Fe-Si-Cr powders were mixed uniformly with the various PI of 0 wt%, 0.4 wt%, 0.7 wt%, 1.0 wt%, respectively (the PI cannot be dissolved into the water or alcohol solution and can be dissolved with N-Methyl pyrrolidone), and air-dried at 80 \u25e6C for 12 h. The dry powders were passed through a screen of \u2212100 mesh. Finally, we prepared and annealed the SMCs; as shown in Figure 1c, the coated Fe-Cr-Si powder was uniformly mixed with zinc stearate lubricant (0.6 wt%). Next, the coated powders were pressed into cores under applied axial stress of 600 MPa with outer diameter of 14 mm, inner diameter of 8 mm, and height of about 3 mm.

Results 3.1. Ch rac eristics of Phosphated and Coated Layer\nAfter the two-step process of phosphating and coating, the oxide layer of the raw powder particles can be removed, and a certain thickness of the phosphate layer and PI insulation layer can be obtained, as shown in Figure 3. On the one hand, phosphating can remove th oxide layer on the surf ce of the original powder, including iron oxide, chromium oxide, and silicon oxide. On the other hand, a phosphating layer can be formed on the surface of powder in the phosphating process so as to increase the resistivity and reduce the eddy current loss [35]. PI is a non-magnetic material; it can increase resistivity but reduc p rmeability. T increase the i sulation resist nce without damaging the magnetic permeability, it is necessary to determine the appropriate content of PI addition\u2014 that is, to optimize the thickness of the Fe-Si-Cr @ phosphate layer @ PI layer core\u2013shell double coating.\n3.1.1. Characteristics of the Phosphated Layer The SEM images of the Fe-Si-Cr raw powder and the phosphated powder are shown\nin Figure 4. It can be seen from Figure 4a that the distribution of the Fe-Si-Cr raw powder particles is relatively dispersed, and most of the particles are spherical or nearly spherical (spindle shape). This is because the cooling rate of the gas atomization process is slower than that of the water atomization process, and it is easy to obtain a spherical powder. At the same time, for the surface oxide layer of powder particles, the gas-atomization process is much smaller than the water-atomization process.

Characteristics of the Phosphated Layer\nThe SEM images of the Fe-Si-Cr raw powder and the phosphated powder are shown in Figure 4. It can be seen from Figure 4a that the distribution of the Fe-Si-Cr raw powder particles is relatively dispersed, and most of the particles are spherical or nearly spherical (spindle shape). This is because the cooling rate of the gas atomization process is slower than that of the water atomization process, and it is easy to obtain a spherical powder. At the same time, for the surface oxide layer of powder particl s, the gas-atomization proce is much smaller than the water-atomization process. It can be seen from Figure 4b that the surface of the Fe-Si-Cr powder particles after phosphating is smooth, which indicates that the phosphate layer is evenly distributed on the surface of the powder.

The total loss (Pcv) is composed of hysteresis loss (Ph), eddy current loss (Pe), and residual loss (Pc). The residual loss is the micro-eddy current generated by the magnetic domain wall, which is very small compared to the hysteresis loss and eddy current loss. It can be ignored. The core loss of all the samples increases with the increase in frequency; at the same frequency, the SMCs have the smallest core loss at the 0.4 wt% PI. When the frequency is 1000 Hz, the core loss is 7086 mW/cm3. Due to the application of double-insulating coatings, the coated cores exhibit lower magnetic loss than uncoated cores; insulating coated layers effectively hinder the current of intra-particles and inter-particles and thus reduce the eddy current loss. When the PI content is 1.0 wt%, the core loss is the largest. Because the insulating layer is a non-magnetic substance, it acts as a hindrance in the magnetization process of the Fe-Si-Cr SMCs, resulting in an increase in hysteresis loss. When the insulating layer is thicker, the eddy current loss is reduced, while the hysteresis loss is increased so that the total core loss is increased.\n3.3.

Phosphating treatment will form a passivation layer on the surface of the powder, and the phosphating layer will crystallize with iron at 500 \u00b0C [43]. In addition, the final annealing temperature should be determined in combination with the heat resistance of the PI coating. As shown in Figure 10, according to the DSC curve, PI has an endothermic peak near 607 \u00b0C, which is the thermal decomposition temperature of PI. According to the TG curve, the 2% thermal weight loss temperature is as high as 500 \u00b0C (mainly due to the evaporation of adsorbed water in PI powder), and the maximum heat-resistant temperature of PI can reach 600 \u00b0C.

The Effect of PI Content and Annealing Temperature on Effective Permeability Figure 13 shows the effective permeability of Fe-Si-Cr SMCs at different PI contents\nand different annealing temperatures. It can be seen that all the samples show the same trend; with the increase in PI content, the effective permeability increases first and then decreases at the same temperature. The phenomenon can be ascribed that the increase in PI leads to the high compaction density of the powder, and thereby the air gap decreases and the effective permeability increases, which can be confirmed in Table 1. The density of core coated at 0.4 wt% PI and annealed at 500 \u00b0C reached 6.213 g/cm3. However, PI is a non-magnetic substance, and the increase in PI causes a decrease in magnetic material and a decrease in effective permeability. The best response was obtained for the sample coated with 0.4 wt% PI. During annealing, the atomic disorder state was changed to an ordered state, the microstructure of Fe-Si-Cr SMCs was optimized well, the air gap was reduced, and the annealed cores were denser, and it can be seen in Table 1 that the density of cores increased with the increase in annealing temperature. Thus, improving the effective permeability of Fe-Si-Cr SMCs, the SMCs show an ideal effect at an annealing temperature of 500 \u00b0C. The Fe-Si-Cr SMCs, with 0.4 wt% content of PI and heat treatment temperature at 500 \u00b0C, exhibited the best magnetic properties: \u03bce = 47 H/m, p = 6222 mW/cm3.\nFigure 12. The trend of magnetic properties with annealing temperature (the powder was phosphated and coated with 0.4 wt% PI): (a) relative permeability; (b) core loss.\nAnnealing can eliminate the residual internal stress and dislocation generated after magnetic particle p es ing, compact the structure, reduce air and other defects, reduce the hysteresis loss coefficient, and finally, reduce the hysteresis loss. The higher the annealing temperature, the more thorough the removal of internal stress, air and dislocation, and other defects between magnetic particles, and the more obvious the effect of loss reduction [44,45]. Figure 12b shows the co e loss of Fe-Si-Cr SMCs annealed at different temperatures. It ca be seen from the figure that the iron loss decreases gradually with the increase in annealing temperature. The core annealed at 500 \u25e6C has the lowest loss, which is only 6222 mW/cm3 at 1000 Hz."

            "text": "Figure 13 shows the effective permeability of Fe-Si-Cr SMCs at different PI contents and different annealing temperatures. It can be seen that all the samples show the same trend; with the increase in PI content, the effective permeability increases first and then decreases at the same temperature. The phenomenon can be ascribed that the increase in PI leads to the high compaction density of the powder, and thereby the air gap decreases and th ffective permeability increases, which can be confirme in Table 1. The density of core coated at 0.4 wt% PI and annealed at 500 \u25e6C reached 6.213 g/cm3. However, PI is a non-magnetic substance, and the increase in PI causes a decrease in magnetic material and a decrease in effective permeability.

            "text": "In this paper, to reduce the core loss of SMCs in high-frequency application environments, the strategies of inorganic\u2013organic double-insulating coating and high-temperature annealing were adopted. Phosphating can not only remove the oxide layer on the powder surface but also form a phosphate insulating coating on the powder surface. This insulating coating can significantly reduce the core loss of SMCs. At the same time, this phosphate is also a good intermediate transition layer for coating organic PI; SMCs coated with organic PI can significantly reduce the core loss, the addition of PI can increase the lubricity of powder in the pressing stage of SMCs, cause the pressed compact have high density, and reduce the existence of defects such as pores, which is conducive to reducing the core loss. Annealing is an effective method to reduce the influence of the pressing process on the magnetic properties of SMCs, which can significantly reduce the core loss. In this study, the Fe-Si-Cr SMCs, with 0.4 wt% content of PI and annealing temperature at 500 \u25e6C, exhibit the best magnetic properties: \u00b5e = 47 H/m, p = 6222 mW/cm3.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, H.L. and J.H.; methodology, H.L. and J.H.; validation, H.L. and X.W.; formal analysis, H.L. and H.Z.; investigation, H.L., X.W. and H.Z.; resources, J.H. and Y.L.; data curation, H.L. and X.W.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, H.L.; writing\u2014review and editing, H.L.; visualization, Y.L.; supervision, J.H.; project administration, J.H.
