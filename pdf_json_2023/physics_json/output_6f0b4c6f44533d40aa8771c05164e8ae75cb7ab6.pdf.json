    "abstractText": "Integration of molecular transition-metal complexes and semiconductors is an appealing method to develop high-performance hybrid photocatalysts based on improvement of their solar energy harvesting ability and photogenerated charge carrier separation efficiency. Herein, Cu-TCPP modified TiO2 porous cages with oxygen vacancy defects, derived from NH2-MIL-125(Ti) nanocrystals, are successfully prepared to form PC-TiO2-d/Cu-TCPP hybrids via a surface assembly process. The PC-TiO2-d/Cu-TCPP hybrid shows an enhanced photodegradation efficiency (73.7%, 95.4%) towards tetracycline in the air under visible light or the simulated sunlight irradiation compared to PC-TiO2-d (33.7%, 81.1%) within 100 min. Moreover, the photocatalytic system is applicable to coupling both processes of solar fuel production and pollutant degradation. The PC-TiO2-d/Cu-TCPP hybrid exhibits a high hydrogen evolution rate of \u223c2 mmol g\u22121 h\u22121 in the aqueous solution of tetracycline in an inert atmosphere upon irradiation by the simulated sunlight. In contrast, an inferior photocatalytic performance of hydrogen evolution is observed in pure water without the addition of tetracycline. Finally, the high sustainability of PC-TiO2-d/Cu-TCPP is mainly attributed to the strong interaction between the molecular photosensitizer and the semiconductor photocatalyst by oxygen vacancies and Cu(II) ions.",

In contrast to kinetically sluggish water oxidation half reaction leading to easy recombination of the photo-generated electron\u2013hole pair, tetracycline as sacricial electron donors enable rapid consumption of holes, beneting for highefficiency photocatalytic hydrogen generation.\nThe low-cost and steady titanium dioxide (TiO2) as a sophisticated photocatalyst has been studied for the integrated reactions of H2 evolution coupled with degradation of organic pollutants.22,23 However, the photo response in the ultraviolet region caused by the wide band gap has negatively affected the widespread applications of TiO2 in photocatalysis.24 For this reason, many reports have focused on the improvement of the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 by extending the wavelength range of light absorption.25 Combination of TiO2 withmolecular\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Porphyrin is an important class of dyes with a wide absorption spectrum and a high extinction coefficient; and the easy modication of porphyrin, such as introducing different functional groups on the mesopositions or b-sites and coordination of metal ions with nitrogen atoms, facilitates the well loading of porphyrin molecules into the surfaces of substrates.29\u201331 Herein, this research aims to develop an efficient synthetic method for preparation of a hybrid photocatalyst consisting of metalloporphyrin-loaded TiO2 and explore its effectiveness in degrading tetracycline and producing hydrogen under visible light irradiation in an aqueous solution of tetracycline."

            "text": "Synthesis of PC-TiO2-d/Cu-TCPP hybrids\nTiO2 with oxygen vacancy defects (TiO2-d), which has been extensively investigated in the eld of catalysis,32\u201336 can easily anchor guest species to construct stable multi-component materials, and porous hollow structures allow to provide much more sites for catalysis and improve mass transfer.37 Typical TiO2-d porous cages (PC-TiO2-d) are produced by a twostep synthetic procedure.38,39 An amino acid-assisted solvothermal route to accomplish the NH2-MIL-125(Ti) transformation in solution was used to prepare nanosheets assembled porous cages of titanium oxides (Fig. S1\u2020), and the as-formed precursor was subsequently calcinated in air to form PC-TiO2-d (Fig. S2\u2020). The anatase PC-TiO2-d corresponding to the tetragonal crystal structure was conrmed by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (Fig. S2a\u2020). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of PC-TiO2-d provided the surface elemental analysis of O and Ti, whose molar ratio is less than 2 : 1, suggesting the possible presence of oxygen vacancies. The O 1s XPS spectrum clearly shows two peaks with the binding energy of 529.9 and 531.7 eV, corresponding to lattice oxygen and oxygen vacancy, respectively; the negative shi of Ti(iv) core-level binding energy of Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 can be found in Ti 2p XPS spectrum at 458.65 and 464.4 eV (Fig. S3\u2020).40,41 These results further unveil the presence of oxygen vacancies. PC-TiO2-d was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electronmicroscopy (TEM) images, in which TiO2d nanoparticles with 20\u201330 nm in diameters assembled into cages were found (Fig. S2b and c\u2020). In addition, the Brunauer\u2013 Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) N2 sorption isotherm of PC-TiO2-d was measured at 77 K to reveal the porous structures. A type-IV hysteresis loop at relative pressure P/P0 higher than 0.4 were observed from the sorption isotherm, signifying the presence of mesoporous structures (Fig. S4a\u2020).\nThe Cu-TCPP (TCPP: tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin) complex was prepared by a typical synthetic procedure, where CuCl2 and tetrakis(4-methoxycarbonylphenyl)porphyrin (TCPP-\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nOMe) was rstly reuxed and subsequently treated by HCl.42 The as-made Cu-TCPP that was conrmed by mass spectrum (Fig. S5\u2020) was mixed with PC-TiO2-d in dimethyl formamide (DMF) to prepare the composite of Cu-TCPP loaded TiO2-d (PCTiO2-d/Cu-TCPP). The porous cages were still observed in SEM and TEM images of the composite, and anatase PC-TiO2-d was not changed according to its XRD pattern aer loading of CuTCPP (Fig. 1a, b, and d). Elemental mapping images of Ti and Cu show that both elements are homogeneously dispersed in whole porous cages (Fig. 1c). The Ti 2p core electron binding energy of PC-TiO2-d/Cu-TCPP is slightly different from that of PC-TiO2-d, signifying the difference in chemical environments of Ti(iv) species between PC-TiO2-d/Cu-TCPP and PC-TiO2d (Fig. 2a). In the deconvoluted O 1s XPS spectrum, a new peak with a binding energy of 530.2 eV is observed, possibly corresponding to the O 1s signal from C\u2013O (Fig. 2b). The peak at 530.2 eV cannot be clearly discernible in the overall O 1s XPS spectrum because of the overlapping of both peaks of C\u2013O and lattice oxygen. More important, both signals of Cu 2p and N 1s were still detected in the survey XPS spectrum of PC-TiO2-d/CuTCPP (Fig. 2c and d). The high-resolution Cu 2p XPS spectrum was deconvoluted into four peaks based on the Shirley type background subtraction method (Fig. 2c). Except for two satellite peaks, others are main peaks of 2p(3/2) and 2p(1/2) of Cu(II). In the N 1s XPS spectrum (Fig. 2d), the redistribution of electron density between pyrro-N and aza-N aer introducing of Cu(II) into the centre of TCPP leads to shiing of two signals to 400.7 and 398.55 eV and an increase of the signal with the low binding energy corresponding to aza-N in intensity.43,44 These experimental observations reveal that Cu-TCPP is successfully anchored on the surfaces of PC-TiO2-d (Fig. 2c). In addition, Raman spectra of PC-TiO2-d/Cu-TCPP and Cu-TCPP show the similar characteristic peaks between 800 and 2000 cm\u22121, assigned to C\u2013N, C\u2013C, and phenyl of porphyrin rings, further conrming the formation of PC-TiO2-d/Cu-TCPP composites (Fig. S6\u2020).43\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 8822\u20138829 | 8823\nFig. 2 High-resolution XPS spectra of (a) Ti 2p, (b) O 1s, (c) Cu 2p and (d) N 1s in PC-TiO2-d/Cu-TCPP porous cages.\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

In the UV-vis absorption spectrum of PC-TiO2-d/CuTCPP, the absorbance in the visible region is greatly increased in comparison with PC-TiO2-d, and two distinct absorption peaks assigned as Soret band and Q-band of Cu-TCPP can be found (Fig. S7b\u2020).45 On the basis, the PC-TiO2-d/Cu-TCPP hybrid could possess high-efficient photocatalytic activity upon visible light irradiation.\nPhotocatalytic performance of PC-TiO2-d/Cu-TCPP hybrids\nTo study the photocatalytic performance of PC-TiO2-d/Cu-TCPP towards tetracycline degradation, PC-TiO2-d/Cu-TCPP powder (5 mg) was dispersed into the dilute aqueous solution of tetracycline (4.5 \u00d7 10\u22125 M, 60 mL). Prior to light irradiation, the resulting mixture was gently stirred in darkness for 30 min to fully absorb tetracycline into PC-TiO2-d/Cu-TCPP. Aerwards, the photodegradation experiment was performed under irradiation of a 300 W Xe short arc lamp equipped with a 420 nm cut-off lter. According to the change of absorbance of the characteristic absorption peak at 358 nm in the UV-vis absorption spectrum of tetracycline, tetracycline was gradually degraded under visible light irradiation (Fig. 3). While the irradiation time is prolonged to 100 min, the degradation percentage (P%) of tetracycline is about 73.7% (Fig. 3b) aer subtraction of tetracycline adsorption. In contrast, PC-TiO2-d shows low degradation percentage (33.4%) under otherwise identical conditions (Fig. 3a). This should be attributed to weak light absorption ability of PC-TiO2-d in the visible region. Predictably, if the simulated sunlight by using an AM 1.5G lter to replace the 420 nm cut-off lter was employed as light source, both PC-TiO2-d/Cu-TCPP and PC-TiO2-d exhibit the enhanced photo-degradation performance of tetracycline (P%: 95.4% and 81.1%, Fig. 3e and d) aer subtraction of tetracycline adsorption. Hence, in the photo-degradation process, we\n8824 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 8822\u20138829\nspeculate that PC-TiO2-d could serve as photocatalysts and CuTCPP could function as photosensitizers to mediate the electron transfer between photocatalysts and electron donors. It is further conrmed by two parallel experiments, wherein the degradation percentage of tetracycline is decreased to 11.7% and 4%, respectively, under simulated sunlight irradiation, if CuTCPP was used alone or any catalysts were not added to the photo-degradation system (Fig. S8\u2020).\nThe recyclability of PC-TiO2-d/Cu-TCPP was also studied under visible light/simulated sunlight irradiation. The obvious loss of the photo-degradation performance towards tetracycline did not arise aer six successive recycling runs of PC-TiO2-d/CuTCPP (Fig. S9\u2020). XRD pattern and SEM and TEM images of PCTiO2-d/Cu-TCPP up to the sixth run reveal the high stability of the structure and morphology of PC-TiO2-d (Fig. S10a\u2013c\u2020). The stable photocatalytic performance of PC-TiO2-d/Cu-TCPP is also related to the strong interaction between Cu-TCPP and PC-TiO2d. The detachment of Cu-TCPP from PC-TiO2-d surfaces seldom occurs during the photo-degradation process. The characteristic absorption peaks of Cu-TCPP can be found in the UV-vis absorption spectrum of PC-TiO2-d/Cu-TCPP aer being used six times (Fig. S10d\u2020), revealing the presence of Cu-TCPP. The photocatalytic system including Cu-TCPP and PC-TiO2-d shows low photocatalytic activity (\u223c49%) towards tetracycline degradation under visible light irradiation. The experimental observation further provides the evidence for the assessment of the stable PC-TiO2-d/Cu-TCPP hybrids. In contrast, TCPP modied PC-TiO2-d (PC\u2013TiO2-d/TCPP) shows poor recyclability under visible light irradiation, and its photocatalytic activity is similar to that of PC-TiO2-d aer three recycling runs (Fig. S11\u2020). The characteristic absorption peaks of TCPP almost cannot be found in the UV-vis absorption spectrum of PC-TiO2-d/TCPP used (Fig. S12\u2020). Hence, Cu(II) ions could play an essential role in anchoring Cu-TCPP molecules on the surfaces of PC-TiO2d by coordination interaction.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

If decreasing the loading amount of CuTCPP from 5 : 100 to 1 : 100, the degradation percentage of tetracycline is declined to 68.6% upon visible light irradiation. The possible explanation is that a small amount of Cu-TCPP cannot provide enough photo-generated electrons to sensitize the photocatalyst PC-TiO2-d. If increasing the loading amount of Cu-TCPP to 10 : 100 and 20 : 100, the degradation percentage of tetracycline is reduced to 62.7% and 53.3%, respectively. The possible scenario is that much more catalytic sites of PC-TiO2d was shielded by Cu-TCPP. If the loading amount of Cu-TCPP continued to increase, the photocatalytic activity of PC-TiO2-d/ Cu-TCPP did not decrease signicantly and the degradation percentage of tetracycline was kept at \u223c50%. The experimental result may be attributed to the saturated adsorption of Cu-TCPP on the surfaces of PC-TiO2-d.\nPorous hollow structures can also be helpful for the enhancement of photocatalytic performance towards tetracycline degradation. For this purpose, TiO2 nanoparticles (TiO2-n) were successfully prepared by direct thermal treatment of NH2MIL-125(Ti) at air atmosphere (Fig. S14\u2020). The as-made TiO2-n displays the low photo-degradation percentage of tetracycline (19.6%) while irradiation of visible light (Fig. S15a\u2020). Aer loading Cu-TCPP, TiO2-n shows enhanced photocatalytic activity (P%: 38%) (Fig. S15b\u2020). Nonetheless, whatever TiO2-n or TiO2-n loaded with Cu-TCPP possesses inferior photocatalytic activity in terms of PC-TiO2-d or PC-TiO2-d/Cu-TCPP. These results conrm that porous cage morphologies make the signicant contribution to the photocatalytic performance of tetracycline degradation possibly due to large surface area with much more catalytic sites and easier transport for guest species.\nPreviously, a pioneer research work involved in the coupling of fuel preparation and pollution utilisation via a photocatalytic process.20 On this basis, PC-TiO2-d/Cu-TCPP was used to study the photocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution and tetracycline degradation in the aqueous solution of tetracycline under simulated sunlight irradiation in Ar atmosphere. While irradiation time is prolonged to 4 h, the hydrogen evolution rate is \u223c2.3 mmol g\u22121 h\u22121 and simultaneously tetracycline degradation is \u223c73.8% (Fig. 4). The quantum yield (QY) is about 0.22% at 475 nm (100 mW cm\u22122). In our case, if the photocatalytic system was not inclusive of tetracycline, the hydrogen\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nevolution is difficultly found under the same conditions. In addition, the aqueous solution of tetracycline without PC-TiO2d/Cu-TCPP cannot generate hydrogen and degrade tetracycline as well upon simulated sunlight irradiation in Ar atmosphere. Hence, PC-TiO2-d/Cu-TCPP serves as photocatalysts that facilitate the coupling of the hydrogen evolution and tetracycline degradation. PC-TiO2-d/Cu-TCPP exhibits high stability in the coupling process of hydrogen evolution and tetracycline degradation, and the hydrogen evolution rate is still as high as \u223c2 mmol g\u22121 h\u22121 aer six successive recycling runs. If PC-TiO2d instead of PC-TiO2-d/Cu-TCPP was added to the photocatalytic system, the hydrogen evolution rate was decreased to \u223c114 mmol g\u22121 h\u22121 within 4 h."

The PC-TiO2-d/CuTCPP hybrids exhibit the signicant enhancement of photocurrent density at 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl in terms of pure PC-TiO2d under chopped simulated sunlight illumination (Fig. 5a), signifying that aer loading Cu-TCPP, PC-TiO2-d shows higher efficiency in separation of photo-generated charges. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to identify charge transfer resistance related to Faraday reactions based on diameters of Nyquist plots in the high frequency region (Fig. 5b). The Nyquist plot of PC-TiO2-d/Cu-TCPP shows a smaller diameter than that of PC-TiO2-d, and thus PC-TiO2-d/ Cu-TCPP had higher charge transfer efficiency at the interfaces between electrodes and electrolytes. These experimental observations further suggest that PC-TiO2-d/Cu-TCPP possesses the superior photo-degradation performance in terms of PCTiO2-d without loading of Cu-TCPP.\nThe high-efficient interfacial electron transfer between CuTCPP and PC-TiO2-d is mainly determined by their energy\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 8822\u20138829 | 8825\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

The electrons of TCPP can transfer to metal centre Cu aer excitation, which was conrmed by photoluminescence quench of Cu-TCPP (Fig. 5c). The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curve of Cu-TCPP shows two pairs of anodic and cathodic peaks, revealing that Cu-TCPP undergoes two reversible one-electron reduction steps at half-wave potential E1/2 of \u223c\u22120.2 and \u22120.6 V (vs. NHE), assigned to the reduction of the metal centre, that is, Cu(II) to Cu(I) and Cu(I) to Cu(0), respectively (Fig. 5d).46 The energy position of the conduction band of PC-TiO2-d was estimated to be \u223c\u22124.25 eV that is located at more negative values (\u223c\u22120.1 V) of the energy position of its at band determined by Mott\u2013Schottky (M\u2013S) curves at different applied potentials (Fig. 5e).47,48 The experimental value of the conduction band is very close to the calculated value according to the empirical equation: Ec = c + E0 \u2212 0.5Eg, wherein c is the absolute electronegativity of PC-TiO2-d, E0 is normal hydrogen electrode redox level versus the absolute vacuum scale, and Eg is the band gap of PC-TiO2-d.49 Hence, the excited electrons of CuTCPP can inject into the conduction band of PC-TiO2-d from Cu centres based on their energy levels.\nIn accordance with the aforementioned experimental data, the enhanced photocatalytic mechanism for tetracycline degradation could involve in the sensitization process of CuTCPP to PC-TiO2-d. In detail, upon light irradiation, the photogenerated electrons in Cu-TCPP are trapped by Cu(II) centres, producing Cu(I) and Cu(0) species by the ligand-to-metal charge transfer process, and the recombination of electron\u2013hole pairs in Cu-TCPP is suppressed. Subsequently, the most photogenerated electrons are injected into the conduction band of PC-TiO2-d from Cu species (Fig. 6, le), further facilitating the separation of charge carriers. According to energy levels between the conduction band of PC-TiO2-d and the redox potential of O2/O2c, the excited electrons can be transferred to O2 to form superoxide radicals (O2c\n\u2212) (Fig. 6, le).18 In addition, the valence band of PC-TiO2-d is about \u22127.29 eV in accordance with its conduction band of its band gap that is obtained from Tauc plot (Fig. 5f). Hence, the holes located at the valence band of PC-TiO2-d can oxidize H2O to produce hydroxyl radicals (OHc) (Fig. 6, le).18 The holes in the HOMO of TCPP, however, are unfavourable for the generation of OHc due to high energy level of HOMO (\u22125.58 eV), and possibly oxidize tetracycline to suppress TCPP degradation.50 To clear the role of the active species of holes, O2c\n\u2212 and OHc in the tetracycline degradation process, some parallel experiments were carried out. While ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and tert-butanol (TBA)\n8826 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 8822\u20138829\nthat function as effective hole and OHc scavengers, respectively, were added to the photocatalytic system,51 the degradation percentage of tetracycline in both experiments was decreased. Moreover, replacing O2 with Ar in the reaction atmosphere results in a decrease in the photo-degradation efficiency of tetracycline. As a result, these active species of holes, O2c\n\u2212 and OHc exerted considerable inuence on the photocatalytic activity of PC-TiO2-d/Cu-TCPP in the tetracycline degradation process (Fig. 6, right). On the basis, the coupling reactions of H2 evolution and tetracycline removal in Ar atmosphere can be achieved because holes and OHc radicals enable tetracycline degradation to occur, and the excited electrons located at the conduction band of PC-TiO2-d can transfer directly to H\n+ ions to formH2 without interference from oxygen (Fig. 6, le and right)."

The PC-TiO2-d/Cu-TCPP photocatalysts show higher photo-degradation percentage of tetracycline than PCTiO2-d and TiO2-n under simulated sunlight or visible light irradiation. The high-performance PC-TiO2-d/Cu-TCPP is benecial from porous structures with high specic surface area, porous structures and strong light harvesting ability of CuTCPP in the visible region. In the photo-degradation process, the species of holes, O2c\n\u2212 and OHc play key roles for tetracycline removal. Finally, the achievement of the coupling of hydrogen evolution and tetracycline degradation without oxygen is due to the presence of holes and OHc radicals. Hence, this research provides a possibility and ideas about preparation of intriguing heterogeneous photocatalysts by combining molecular photosensitizers with semiconductors while achieving the treatment of environmental pharmaceutical pollutants and the acquisition of clean solar fuels."
