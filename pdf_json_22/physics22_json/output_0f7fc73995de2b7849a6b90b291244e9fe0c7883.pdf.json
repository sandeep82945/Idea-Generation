    "abstractText": "We review how lattice QCD can contribute to the prediction and the comprehension of tetraquarks, pentaquarks and related exotic hadrons such as hybrids, with at least one heavy quark. We include all families of exotic hadrons, except for the quarkless glueballs, and the hexaquarks which are related to nuclear physics. Since the discovery of quarks and the development of the QCD theory, there has been a large interest in exotic hadrons, initiated by the tetraquark models developed by Jaffe in 1977. Lattice QCD, being a first principle approach to solve non-perturbative QCD, has been crucial not only to compute precise results, but also to motivate and inspire research in hadronic physics, with particular interest in exotic hadrons. In the new millennium, this interest exploded with several experimental discoveries of tetraquark and pentaquark resonances with heavy quarks, starting with the Zc and Zb. So far, lattice QCD has not yet been able to comprehend this Z class of tetraquarks, and is developing new methods to determine their masses, decay widths and decay processes. The interest in tetraquarks was also fuelled by the lattice QCD prediction of a second class of tetraquarks such as the Tbb, boundstates in the sense of having no strong decays. Very recently, the Tcc tetraquark first predicted with quark models in 1982 by Richard et al, was observed experimentally. We expect the lattice QCD community will be able to explore this T class of tetraquarks in more detail and with very precise results. We report on all the different direct and indirect approaches that lattice QCD, so far with most focus on tetraquarks, has been employing to study exotic hadrons with at least one heavy quark. We also briefly review the experimental progress in observing tetraquarks and pentaquarks, and the basic theoretical paradigms of tetraquarks, including three different types of mechanisms (diquark, molecular and s pole), comparing them with the results of lattice QCD. We aim to show the journey of Lattice QCD in the exploration of these fascinating and subtle hadrons.",

            "text": "We review how lattice QCD can contribute to the prediction and the comprehension of tetraquarks, pentaquarks and related exotic hadrons such as hybrids, with at least one heavy quark. We include all families of exotic hadrons, except for the quarkless glueballs, and the hexaquarks which are related to nuclear physics.\nSince the discovery of quarks and the development of the QCD theory, there has been a large interest in exotic hadrons, initiated by the tetraquark models developed by Jaffe in 1977. Lattice QCD, being a first principle approach to solve non-perturbative QCD, has been crucial not only to compute precise results, but also to motivate and inspire research in hadronic physics, with particular interest in exotic hadrons.\nIn the new millennium, this interest exploded with several experimental discoveries of tetraquark and pentaquark resonances with heavy quarks, starting with the Zc and Zb. So far, lattice QCD has not yet been able to comprehend this Z class of tetraquarks, and is developing new methods to determine their masses, decay widths and decay processes.\nThe interest in tetraquarks was also fuelled by the lattice QCD prediction of a second class of tetraquarks such as the Tbb, boundstates in the sense of having no strong decays. Very recently, the Tcc tetraquark first predicted with quark models in 1982 by Richard et al, was observed experimentally. We expect the lattice QCD community will be able to explore this T class of tetraquarks in more detail and with very precise results.\nWe report on all the different direct and indirect approaches that lattice QCD, so far with most focus on tetraquarks, has been employing to study exotic hadrons with at least one heavy quark. We also briefly review the experimental progress in observing tetraquarks and pentaquarks, and the basic theoretical paradigms of tetraquarks, including three different types of mechanisms (diquark, molecular and s pole), comparing them with the results of lattice QCD. We aim to show the journey of Lattice QCD in the exploration of these fascinating and subtle hadrons.\nKeywords: Quantum Chromodynamics, Lattice Field Theory, Exotic Hadrons, Tetraquarks, Pentaquarks, Heavy and Light quarks PACS:\nContents"

            "text": "After the quarks were proposed in the sixties by Gell-Mann [1] and Zweig [2, 3], the Pandora box opened and the physics of quarks and gluons exploded in the seventies. The charm quark was predicted in 1970 [4] and observed in 1974 [5, 6]. Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) was first shown to be renormalizable with Feynman diagrams [7], and then assymtotic free in 1973 [8, 9]. Soon after, in 1974, a discrete and numerical version of QCD, lattice QCD was presented by Wilson [10]. Exotic four-quark hadrons, the tetraquarks, beyond the common two-quark mesons and three-quark baryons were proposed and worked out by Jaffe within the bag model in 1977 [11, 12].\nHowever, after the lightning fast seventies, the progress in QCD slowed down. An initial surge of interest in exotics was motivated by the proposal of the dibaryon H [13]. On the experimental side, it took many decades for exotic hadrons to be observed experimentally. On the theoretical side, QCD is fundamentally non-perturbative and definite theoretical results are difficult to achieve. While models are important to develop ideas and test them, expensive fist principle techniques such as lattice QCD are necessary to validate the theory of exotic hadrons. Meanwhile some claims of light exotics turned out to either be complicated such as the light crypto-exotics - which are difficult to separate from ordinary mesons - or remained unconfirmed experimentally after many experimental searches.\nIn the new millennium, the interest in exotics peaked again with searches of the pentaquark \u03b8+ [14, 15], leading to many theoretical and experimental works. This also coincided with the planning of the experimental facility FAIR in Darmstadt, who will soon be contributing to this field. While the \u03b8+ remained unconfirmed, the interest in exotic was maintained by the consistent discovery of a new class of exotic multiquarks. This is clear in the bumps in the citation evolution of two seminal multiquark papers, shown in Fig. 1.\nFinally, there is one direction in the exotic world where exotic hadrons are found: multiquarks with some heavy quarks. In the early eighties, Richard [16, 17, 18, 19] and colleagues were already proposing a mechanism for tetraquark stability. Using the unbalance in the quark masses, they realized realized Tcc, and other tetraquarks with two heavy quarks, were the most promising ones for future discoveries.\nIndeed it took many decades for our knowledge of QCD to mature and prove Richard was right. At last, in the new millennium, exotic tetraquarks with heavy quarks have finally been confirmed experimentally, starting by the Zc and the Zb who were produced in different types of B meson factories. Meanwhile, lattice QCD also has been progressing, and was able to show from first principles that the tetraquark Tbb should\nform a boundstate. This already increased the literature interest in tetraquarks, see Fig. 1. Presently there are more than 40 different experimental evidences of different tetraquarks and pentaquarks, most of them with two heavy quarks, including the very recently observed [20, 21] Tcc. This led to a more consistent theoretical interest in tetraquarks, pentaquarks and other exotics."

            "text": "We briefly review the landscape of multiquark resonances so far observed, in more than forty different experiments and lattice QCD computations, for instance Fig. 2 shows the large number of resonances discovered at just one of the particle accelerators, the LHC [76, 77]. Notice LHC is proposing a new naming convention. However we still follow the Particle Data Group (PDG) naming convention [78].\nSince there are many tetraquark resonances we divide them in different tables, classifying them with their flavour content and their stability.\nIn Table 1, we review the flavour singlet, tetraquark candidates observed experimentally. These tetraquarks are not explicitly exotic, they have been coined crypto-exotic [11], but they may be considered tetraquarks because they don\u2019t fit the spectrum of quark-antiquark mesons in the quark model. The first state of this type is the \u03c7c1(3872), observed at Belle [22] in 2003, has been extensively discussed in the literature. Presently there are twelve different such states, with flavour cc\u0304(uu\u0304 + dd\u0304), cc\u0304ss\u0304, bb\u0304(uu\u0304 + dd\u0304) and the very recently observed cc\u0304cc\u0304. The latter, X(6900) and X(6600) resonances with flavour cc\u0304cc\u0304, were observed at LHCb in 2020 [32] and CMS in 2022 [33], and could belong to the next group of tetraquarks as well.\nThen we list in Table 2 the unambiguous tetraquark resonances. The first one discovered was the Z+c (4330), at Belle [51]. Some of these resonances have a heavy quark antiquark pair and a light quarkantiquark pair, we then denote them ll\u0304QQ\u0304. These cases are not strictly flavour exotic, since the QQ\u0304 pair has no flavour or charge, the heavy flavour is hidden [79], but nevertheless its masses clearly require a QQ\u0304\npair and then the ll\u0304 has isospin and charge only compatible with an exotic. Several of these states have been observed at B meson factories, others in colliders. The B meson weak decay produces frequently a cc\u0304 pair plus quarks and leptons, and the Zc tetraquarks are for instance observed in two-meson correlations in hadronic three-body decays. Nineteen states of this class have been observed by several collaborations, with flavours c\u0304dus\u0304, cc\u0304ud\u0304, cc\u0304us\u0304, bb\u0304ud\u0304 and relates ones. The Zb tetraquarks has only been observed by the Belle collaboration, in 2011, among the decay products of the \u03a5(5S). Belle is a B meson factory at the KEK electron positron collider which is tuned to produce bottomonium and BB\u0304 meson pairs. In this case, the other experimental collaborations have not been able to address these resonances. Nevertheless, the\nBelle observation has a high significance, see Table 2. In this table we also include is the light exotic \u03c01, which is most likely a hybrid, observed in 2012 at COMPASS and analysed at JPAC [35, 36] with exotic parity and charge conjugation, JPC(IG) = 1\u2212+(1\u2212), but which quantum numbers are also compatible with a tetraquark.\nWe also include in a the next Table 3 the only tetraquarks which are boundstates or very narrow resonances. So far, they turn out to be absolutely flavour exotic. These tetraquark, have two heavy quarks (or antiquarks), and we denote them llQ\u0304Q\u0304 or TQQ. They have been predicted theoretically since 1981 [16]. From 2012 [61], they started to be been computed from first principles in lattice QCD, with the b quark as the heavy quark. This class of tetraquarks was just discovered in 2021, at LHCb, with flavour c\u0304c\u0304ud [20, 21].\nNotice that, in terms of flavour, not all tetraquarks in Table 2 are of the Z type with a heavy QQ\u0304 pair. The X0(2900) and X1(2900) only have one heavy quark, but they have a strange quark, the less light quark pair they have is a c\u0304s\u0304, in this sense they can be related to the TQQ tetraquarks of Table 3. Table 2 also includes the tetraquarks X(6600) and X(6900) denominated by LHC as T\u03c8\u03c8, with four heavy quarks, which is both of the T and Z tetraquark type.\nFinally we list in table 4 the Pc and Pcs pentaquarks, first observed at LHCb in 2015 [80]. These pentaquarks, as most of the so far observed tetraquarks, are hidden heavy flavour states, in that sense they are an extension of the Zc tetraquarks."

            "text": "We now review some of the main ideas in hadronic models who may impact multiquark systems. Because the literature is quite vast, we are not able to be any comprehensive at all in this brief review. We opt to follow a historical panorama, relating some of the different types of hadronic models with simple concepts.\nWe also describe three types of mechanisms driving tetraquarks, since the tetraquarks are the simplest multiquarks and what binds a tetraquark may also bind a pentaquark or a hexaquark. Tetraquarks may\nbe molecular meson-meson systems with Yukawa-like meson exchange interactions similar to the ones of nuclear physics. Besides, tetraquarks may have a novel diquark-antidiquark core producing the necessary attraction to bind them. Moreover tetraquarks may appear as non-perturbative poles in the scattering matrix with meson-meson and quarkonium coupled channels, well beyond the Born approximation, where quark-antiquark annihilation and creation produces the main driving effect. We respectively denominate these systems molecular tetraquarks, diquark tetraquarks and s pole tetraquarks.\n1.3.1. Nuclear physics and meson-meson molecular tetraquarks As soon as mesons were proposed in the thirties by Yukawa [81] to understand the NN interaction, it would be plausible that meson-meson molecules could exist as well. The long range part of the NN strong interaction [82] according to the Nijmegen, Paris, Bonn, Argonne, potentials [83, 84, 85, 86], is due to meson exchange, in particular at large distances the one pion exchange potential (OPEP) dominates. The pion, which is an isovector and a pseudoscalar, couples to the nucleon with a flavour Pauli matrix \u03c4 and with a spin-derivative coupling \u03c3 \u00b7 p, and the long distance part of the OPEP potential is,\nV\u03c0NN (r) = f\u03c0NN 2 e \u2212m\u03c0r\nr (\u03c41 \u00b7 \u03c42)(\u03c31 \u00b7 r\u0302)(\u03c32 \u00b7 r\u0302) (1)\nIn this perspective, with two mesons with flavour I = 1/2 , say uc\u0304 and dc\u0304 as in the recently observed [20, 21] Tcc a boundstate similar to a deuteron composed by a proton p = uud and a neutron n = ddu, e.g. which have the same flavour I = 1/2, could exist as well. Notice the flavour term in OPEP, \u03c41 \u00b7\u03c42, could produce an attraction between a DD or a BB similar to the one in the NN system. Thus several authors are proposing the observed experimental resonances to be molecular tetraquarks [87]."

            "heading": "1.3.2. Spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking",
            "text": "Spontaneous symmetry breaking is crucial to all areas of theoretical physics. In early sixties, Nambu and Jona-Lasinio [91] addressed the problem of having a light boson, the pion, composed of a pair of much heavier fermions, nucleons. They succeeded by devising a model for the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking (S\u03c7SB). In the initial Lagrangian, the fermions are massless and the theory is chiral invariant. When S\u03c7SB occurs, the fermions acquire a mass and the lightest boson is massless, it is a Nambu-Goldstone boson [92]. The sigma model was also developed by Gell-Mann and Levy, with the same S\u03c7SB [93] but using only bosons, and in this case it is the scalar boson sigma who acquires a mass. This scientific revolution was completed by the non-linear topological model of Skyrme, who was able to produce fermions from bosons [94]. S\u03c7SB leads to several theorems of current algebra and of Partially Conserved Axial Currents (PCAC). S\u03c7SB is also one of the building blocks of effective chiral Lagrangians [95]. Such an important phenomenon is of course relevant for the hadron masses and their interactions, and affects any multiquark with light quarks.\nAfter quarks were discovered, the Nambu and Jona-Lasinio model was successfully applied to quark systems. This mechanism stabilizes the vacuum, and in doing so provides mass to the quarks. In the chiral limit,\npseudoscalar mesons like the pion would be massless. Moreover the sigma model can be supplemented with exotic hadrons. These models for S\u03c7SB have a caveat: they are non-renormalizable. A more fundamental renormalizable theory is necessary.\nIn the case of hadronic physics, the solution to this problem is QCD. It is a fully renormalizable theory and in principle it includes S\u03c7SB, which is verified in lattice QCD. Notice S\u03c7SB may be one of the reasons why lattice QCD is computable: the preconditioning with heavier quark masses, mentioned in Subsection 1.4, may work because the constituent quark mass is much heavier than the bare quark mass.\n1.3.3. Quark confinement, hadronic strings, and hybrid mesons Then, in the mid sixties, the hadronic physics focus shifted to confining strings. Notice flux tubes and strings have been studied for a long time in type II superconductivity, where the magnetic field is confined. In 1911 Kamerlingh-Onnes [96] discovered superconductivity, the Meissner-Ochsenfeld [97] effect was discovered in 1933. In 1935, Rjabinin and Shubnikov [98] experimentally discovered the Type-II superconductors. In 1950, Landau and Ginzburg [99], continued by Abrikosov [100], arrived at superconductor vortices, or flux tubes. Interestingly, superconductors (and ferromagnets) also include the spontaneous symmetry breaking of Subsection 1.3.2.\nWhen confinement was proposed for quarks inside hadrons in 1964 by Gell-Mann [1] and Zweig [2, 3], the analogy with flux tubes also led to an explosion of the number of publications in the literature on the quantum excitations of strings. Lattice QCD by Wilson in 1974 was partly inspired in strings [10]. It was also realized that experimentally, the meson spectra lie in linear j(M2) Regge trajectories, and this is characteristic of strings. It is interesting that the similar slope of radial and angular excitations, so far can only be understood with strings. Moreover a string-like confinement implies for heavy quarks a linear confinement plus a Coulomb term due to the string quantum vibrations, the L\u00fcscher term, and this is the backbone of the potentials used in most quark models,\nVQQ\u0304(r) = \u03c3r \u2212 \u03c0\n12\n1 r . (2)\nThe interest in strings returned in 1997 when Maldacena [101] and others explored the AdS/CFT correspondence. The AdS/CFT and Holography has also been used as a model to compute spectra in hadronic physics. Besides, strings continue to be relevant to the study of exotics. Strings already are expected to form exotic systems, denominated hybrids, when the quantum numbers of the strings are excited. While the simplest possible strings do not form tetraquarks, QCD strings with junctions may bind tetraquarks.\n1.3.4. Quark models and diquark tetraquarks Since the seventies, as soon as quarks were discovered it was expected that tetraquarks and other exotics should exist. The first models were the bag models [102, 103, 104, 105] where the quarks are assumed to dig a bubble (similar to a broad string) in the vacuum, and are confined by the vacuum pressure. Since the eighties, the dominant quark models in the literature have been the potential quark models, with many different variants of the original Ref. [106] and its spin dependent terms,\nVij(rij) \u221d 1 rij \u2212 \u03c0 2 \u03b43(rij)\n( 1\nmi2 +\n1\nmj2 + 16Si \u00b7 Sj 3mimj\n) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (3)\nincluding the standard relativized quark model of Ref. [107]. At short distances the quark models rely on an extension of the one gluon exchange potential (OGEP) of Eq. (3) and at large distances confinement is provided by a thin string, as in Eq. (2), in agreement with the results of lattice QCD.\nThis is an adiabatic approach in the sense the gluons are supposed to be integrated out, and their role is to provide the potential for the quarks. It is also generally supposed the short range part of the potential is vector-like, from OGEP while the long part range is scalar-like, from the string [108].\nQuarks are coloured particles, in a colour triplet 3 representation of SU(3). Colour-wise, with four quarks, two independent colour singlets may exist. A possible doublet is the orthogonal basis 11 and 88, another possible doublet is the orthogonal basis 3\u03043 and 66\u0304. Notice these two possible bases are different but not orthogonal, 11 overlaps with 3\u03043. Moreover with flavour, spin and space many more independent combinations of four quarks may exist. Nevertheless, depending on the geometry of the system, either one of the two meson-meson colour combinations 11 or the diquark tetraquark 3\u03043 may be the lowest energy state, see Fig. 3. In this case it is plausible diquark tetraquarks 3\u03043 may exist. There is a wide interest in the literature on whether the observed tetraquark systems are diquark tetraquarks with colour 3\u03043 described by quark models [109, 110] , or molecular meson-meson tetraquarks with colour 11 described by models of the nuclear physics type. The models with string-flop potentials [111], defined in Subsection 2.2 explore the combination of both colours. However these models still need improvement, the binding of Tbb using flip-flop is still too large in some quantum numbers [112], possibly because it does not yet have spin effects."

            "heading": "1.3.5. Quark impact on nuclear physics, chiral symmetry, strings and the scattering matrix",
            "text": "Notice that the discovery of the quarks, fermions with SU(3) colour, had an important feedback on our understanding of nuclear physics, chiral symmetry breaking and string theory. In nuclear physics, Ribeiro [113] used the quark content of the nucleon to derive the NN repulsion at short distances. The NN repulsive core can be computed from quark models, applying the Resonating Group Method (RGM, devised by Wheeler for Nuclear Physics) [114] to the quarks and their interactions. The main mechanism is the interplay of the Pauli principle for the fermionic quarks and the hyperfine quark-quark interaction, present in the potential of Eq. (3) as illustrated in Fig. 4. The same principle can be applied to any other hadronic interactions, for instance to KN exotic scattering [115]. This work is very technical since the short range interaction of hadrons involves microscopically 4 particles for a tetraquark, 5 particles for a pentaquark or 6 particles for a hexaquark, with complicated potentials and colour, flavour, spin and Jacobi coordinates.\nThe spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry has also been included in confining quark models in the eighties, see Fig. 4, by Adler and Davis, le Yaouanc et al and Bicudo and Ribeiro. The first interest of this approach was to compute with a Bogoliubov-Valatin transformation [116, 117] the quark condensate that breaks the chiral symmetry in the QCD vacuum, composed of 3P0 scalar quark-antiquark pairs, computed with the non-linear mass gap equation. Then the light states have a more complicated boundstate equation, say a least a Salpeter or a Bethe-Salpeter equation, with more coupled channels due to negative energy components [118, 119], leading to a vanishing pseudoscalar meson mass in the chiral invariant limit. This explains the large splitting between the \u03c0 and \u03c1 mesons. Equivalent to this is the Dyson-Schwinger approach [120, 121, 122, 123], a truncated version of diagrammatic QCD. These approaches can be also extended to the gluon sector of QCD [124]. Moreover the authors of Ref. [117] were interested to study how S\u03c7SB impacts on the microscopic derivation of hadron-hadron interactions. The strength of the hadron-hadron interactions decreases, even more so for the interactions of the light mesons who are suppressed by the Adler zero. This led to very consistent works, proving that quark models can comply with the PCAC theorems [125, 126] including the Weinberg theorem for \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 scattering [127]. However S\u03c7SB makes the quark models very technical, and harder to calibrate since few parameters are used but their impact on the results is non-linear.\nWith the S\u03c7SB, it is then possible to also include quark-antiquark annihilation and creation in the RGM , compute the hadron couplings to derive coupled channel equations for hadrons and the respective decay channels. The T matrix can be computed with the Lippmann-Schwinger series. Then the s matrix, defined by Wheeler [114], can be analytically continued to the Argand space and its poles can be determined [128], providing the mass and decay width of hadronic resonances.\nIn what concerns string physics, quarks are attached to the ends of open strings (without quarks we may only have closed strings). Moreover the QCD strings may bifurcate and we have the y string in baryons, and more complicated strings with two junctions in tetraquarks and with three junctions in pentaquarks. Thus the flux tubes of SU(3) QCD correspond to more complex world sheets than the simplest string theories. They will be detailed in Subsection 2.1.\n1.3.6. Non-perturbative dynamical s pole tetraquark resonances A third type of mechanism produces resonant poles in the scattering matrix, due to meson exchange in the channel s Mandelstam variable, forming crypto-exotic systems, with a dominant tetraquark component. The threes types of strong interaction mechanisms able to drive the formation of tetraquarks are then,\n\u2022 quark-quark and antiquark-antiquark forces of Subsection 1.3.4 at the QCD scale for diquark tetraquarks, in the case advocated by Richard [16, 17, 18, 19], requiring an imbalance for the masses, with two heavier quarks (or antiquarks) and two light antiquarks (or quarks), is certainly exotic; however the diquark-antidiquark approach may also lead to crypto-exotic mesons [110];\n\u2022 nuclear-physics like forces of Subsection 1.3.1 with attractive meson exchange and repulsive short range for molecular tetraquarks, this is expected to produce resonances just below the threshold of the molecular system which may be exotic or crypto-exotic, for instance the OPEP attraction favours I=0; in this case the attraction is due to a t channel exchange, illustrated in Fig. 5 c),\n\u2022 non-perturbative coupled channel equations, driven by the coupling of a pair of mesons to quarkonium; when it is strong enough, it originates non-perturbatively poles in the s matrix, we denominate this third type s pole tetraquark since is corresponds to an s channel exchange, illustrated in Fig. 5 b),\nThe intrinsic QCD part of the forces, may partly be illustrated in Fig. 5 a). It is clear in this figure that these three mechanisms are not exclusive, they may act conjointly to produce a tetraquark. It is important to understand, for each tetraquark, what is the dominant mechanism.\nAn example of the third type s pole tetraquark is the \u03c3 meson. It was already advocated by Jaffe in 1974 as a crypto-exotic. The \u03c3 meson took many decades to be understood because it is a wide resonance with a much lower mass that the scalar quarkonium groundstate, but presently it is confirmed [129] by detailed analyses, with a large \u03c0\u03c0 component.\nThe \u03c3 meson is related to most of the points discussed in this subsection. It was anticipated as a meson, t channel exchanged, in the N \u2212 N , necessary to bind the deuteron. Then it appeared in the first models of S\u03c7SB as the massive partner of the pion [92] which is massless in the chiral limit. Effective meson models, with a coupled channel of two pions and a scalar meson, where the pion pair can annihilate into a scalar meson [130, 131], find an extra, dynamical pole in the s matrix, corresponding to the \u03c3 meson. The inverse mechanism to the meson pair annihilation is string breaking. The coupling can also be computed microscopically in a quark model [132, 133], in an approach complying with the analyticity of the s matrix, and this case an extra full nonet of scalar mesons, with poles in the second Riemann sheet of the s matrix analytical continuation, is obtained [131].\nNotice, if the coupling is small, then the Born approximation can be used to compute the decay width of the scalar meson, equivalent to the Fermi Golden rule. In this case there is a single pole in the s matrix, close to the energy of the scalar quarkonium meson. But when the coupling is strong, a new pole is dynamically produced in the s matrix, far from the scalar qq\u0304 meson mass. The content of this resonance has a small qq\u0304 component and a large qqq\u0304q\u0304 component, it can be interpreted as a crypto-exotic tetraquark.\nThe S\u03c7SB can also be included in a consistent way in this mechanism. Using the Nambu and JonaLasinio chiral invariant interaction, Bernard et al [134] computed a series of bubble diagrams in Fig. 5 equivalent to the exchange of a scalar meson in the s Mandelstam variable. They reproduced the Weinberg theorem [127] for \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 scattering. This was generalized to any chiral invariant quark model and to the Dyson-Schwinger approach in Refs. [125, 126].\nThen, the mechanism is the s channel exchange of a scalar meson between the \u03c0\u2212\u03c0 pair. This is allowed in meson-meson systems where a quark-antiquark pair may be annihilated, but not in nuclear physics where only t channel meson exchange is expected. In the case of \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 scattering, the pion pair partly annihilates\ninto a scalar meson. This produces a series of bubble diagrams as in Fig. 6, similar to the ones exchanged in the s channel in Fig. 5 b) but with effective mesons instead of quarks.\nThis mechanism is expected to also hold when at most a quark and an antiquark are heavy, since we need a light quark-antiquark pair to be created from the quarkonium and to be annihilated again, repeatedly, in a series of bubble diagrams. For instance, most of the crypto-tetraquark candidates of Table 1 might be of the s pole tetraquark type."

            "heading": "1.4. Minimal overview of the lattice QCD techniques used here",
            "text": "Historically, theoretical models have been crucial to understand the concepts of hadronic physics. Nature hides its fundamental hadronic building blocks, the quarks and gluons. They appear indirectly in many different phenomena, who need particular perspectives to be understood. There is colour and its confinement, several different flavours with different quark mass scales, spontaneous partial chiral symmetry breaking, asymptotic freedom, the deconfinement crossover transition, nuclear physics, nuclear matter, etc , as partly reviewed in Subsection 1.3.\nHadronic models, say quark models or effective hadron models, are important to understand all these complex concepts and they can reproduce the experimental results up to a good approximation. However the larger the number of experiments they reproduce, the larger the number of needed parameters, and the most comprehensive models end up by being cumbersome to work out.\nSo far, the only first principle non-perturbative approach to hadronic physics is Lattice QCD [10], using explicitly the QCD Lagrangian with no approximations except for its cutoffs [135, 136]. This statement should be taken with a grain of salt, because there are other different approximations to QCD. But, nevertheless, lattice QCD is, so far, the only approach able to get arbitrarily close to QCD. The first computations were performed by Creutz in the late seventies [137, 138, 139, 140, 141], and since then, with the exponential development of computers, the lattice QCD results have been converging to the experimental data.\nNotice there are two different types of QCD lattices. Quenched lattice QCD only includes the gluon fields, in the links of the lattice. Dynamical lattice QCD includes as well the quark fields, in the points of the lattice. For the gluonic observables, such as glueballs or static quarks cases both produce similar results, for instance for potentials, such as the string tension and the Coulomb potential. In other phenomena, quenched and dynamical QCD are quite different. For instance in phase transitions, pure gauge QCD has a deconfinement transition of first order at temperature Td \u223c 260 K , whereas dynamical QCD has a deconfinement and chiral transition which is a crossover at a much smaller temperature of Td \u223c 155 K.\nIn the Lagrangian of QCD [8, 9] there are few physical parameters, just the current/bare quark masses because the coupling is dimensionless. While the analytic proof of confinement remains a major open problem in theoretical physics, in lattice QCD the confinement scale emerge from the numerical computations, since the quantisation on the lattice produces a dimensional transmutation. When the computations are precise enough, with small lattice spacings as, at and large space-time volume as3NxNy Nz \u00d7 atNt, lattice QCD\nB\nB\nbb bb\n+\ngets results arbitrarily close to QCD, and so far the results also get arbitrarily close to the experimental ones. This is the main proof that QCD is indeed the fundamental theory of strong interactions.\nHowever lattice QCD also has its technical problems. An obvious problem is that lattice QCD is technically very demanding. Monte Carlo techniques borrowed from statistical physics, derived from the path integral, require the full power of high performance computing both in computational power and in coding efficiency. Computations are so far limited to lattices of size 1004. Thus there are lattice QCD groups only in rich enough countries, essentially in the same countries who are able to perform high energy physics experiments.\nMoreover, contrary to models, in lattice QCD gluons are much easier to understand and cheaper to study than fermions which creators are Grassmann variables. Finite temperature is also easier to study than a vanishing one. In other words, the lightest the fermions and the smallest the temperature, the more expensive the computations. Nevertheless, there are different approaches to circumvent the difficulties of using fermions, and systems with up to six dynamical quarks have been studied with lattice QCD.\nThe third difficulty of lattice QCD resides in the necessity of an Euclidean space to have a positive definite probability density. This space is reached with a Wick rotation. The probability is then the exponential of minus the action e\u2212SE [\u03a6], where we use the notation of Gattringer and lang [136]. While some computations turn out to be difficult, with a sign problem in the action, the hadron spectra at zero fermion density can be computed in lattice QCD. This is the foundation stone of all the lattice QCD computations we are reporting here.\nSo far, the main techniques used to study tetraquarks in Lattice QCD are all based in computing the\nenergy of observables, extracted from the evolution operator of correlation matrices in Euclidean space,\n\u3008O2(t)O1(0)\u3009T = 1\nZT\n\u222b D[\u03a6]e\u2212SE [\u03a6]O2[\u03a6(\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7nt)]O1[\u03a6(\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0)]\nZT =\n\u222b D[\u03a6]e\u2212SE [\u03a6]\nD[\u03a6] = \u220f n\u2208\u039b d\u03a6(n) (4)\nwhere O1 and O2 are two operators sharing similar quantum numbers, and t is the Euclidean time. T is the temporal size of the lattice, close to zero temperature it should be very large. The probability density is utilized to generate an ensemble of configurations that capture the physics of the system we are studying. The results are obtained statistically, the larger the ensemble the smallest the error bar. In this sense the results of lattice QCD are similar to the experimental results in quantum physics, where small error bars result from many independent observations. But in lattice QCD we can ask different, more theoretical questions that in the real experiment. Thus lattice QCD complements both the experiments and the theoretical hadronic models.\nWhen the Wick rotation changes from the Minkowski space-time to the Euclidean space-time the time evolution operator also changes from an oscillating function to a decaying exponential,\ne\u2212iH\u0302t \u2192 e\u2212H\u0302t (5) Thus, if we compute the evolution operator, it should decay exponentially. And fitting this exponential, we extract the energy matrix H\u0302 of our system.\nLet us show this in the simplest case, where we just compute the groundstate energy. Denoting |O1(0)\u3009 the physical quantum state corresponding to the operator O1(0), it can be decomposed in eigenvectors of the hamiltonian,\n|O1(0)\u3009 = \u2211 i ci|vi\u3009 (6)\nand the matrix element between the same operator at different times is, \u3008O1(t)|O1(0)\u3009 = \u2211 i c\u2217i cie \u2212\u03bbit , (7)\nclearly for a time long enough the groundstate dominates this matrix element. Technically, we compute the effective mass,\nmeff(nt + 1/2) = ln C(nt)\nC(nt + 1) \u2192 \u03bb0 (8)\nand plot as a function of the time separation nt, it to identify a plateau before the noise gets larger than the signal.\nThus, assuming the ensemble of configurations is large enough, and employing noise reduction techniques [146, 147, 148, 149, 150], to have a good signal over noise ratio, what we have choose is a set of operators O1, O2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 to describe our system, and compute the correlation matrix between these operators at time t and time 0 to determine the time evolution of our operators. If we are clever enough, we can study important theoretical structures such as potentials, a spectrum, the wavefunctions / Bethe-Salpeter amplitudes of the groundstate and excited states, and scattering matrices.\nWe remark the correlation matrix elements must be gauge invariant (unless we want to use some gauge fixing) since the sum over the configurations also sums over the gauges, and gauge dependent correlations would have a vanishing mean value. To devise gauge invariant correlators, notice each lattice link (connecting two neighbour points) transforms under a local set of SU(3) matrices \u2126(x) depending on the position vector x, U\u00b5(x)\u2192 \u2126(x)U\u00b5(x)\u2126\u2020(x+ \u00b5) (9) and fermion propagators transform in the same way, albeit they can connect any pair of points of the lattice,\nS(x,y)\u03b1\u03b2ab \u2192 \u2126(x)aa\u2032S(x,y)\u03b1\u03b2a\u2032b\u2032\u2126(y) \u2020 b\u2032b. (10)\nWe can get gauge invariant objects either using a closed loop of links, or with a path composed of gauge links and propagators. In this case, all the gauge transformation matrices contribute in products \u2126\u2020(x) \u00b7\u2126(x) = 1.\nThus the simplest operator we can have is just a point x in space. To construct a gauge invariant correlator, it is connected with a path of links (or propagators) to other operators in the form,\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7U\u00b5\u2020a c(x)U\u03bda b(x) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (11)\nand if the path is closed in loops, we just need the group to be unitary for this to be gauge invariant. A simple example is the Wilson Loop, a closed rectangular loop composed by a chain of links. Another example is the Polyakov loop in a lattice with periodic boundary conditions, a purely temporal loop winding around the toroidal lattice.\nAnother interesting example of an operator, relevant for the study of tetraquarks, is the operator creating a baryon, used in Fig. 7 (left). If three links (or Nc links in the more general case of SU(Nc) links converge or diverge at one point, then we can construct an operator with a Levi-Civita Symbol, connected with links in this form, \u03b5a b\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7U\u00b5a a\u2032(x)U\u03bdb b\u2032(x) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (12) which is gauge invariant if \u03b5a b\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u2126a a\u2032(x)\u2126b b\u2032(x) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = \u03b5a\u2032 b\u2032\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 (13) where the indices are colour indices. Let us start by the simplest particular case a\u2032 = 1, b\u2032 = 2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = Nc,\n\u03b5a b\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u2126a 1(x)\u2126a 2(x) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = det[\u2126] (14)\nand since \u2126 is a SU(Nc) matrix this determinant is 1 = \u03b51 2\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7. Any other permutation of the indices 1 2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 produces a \u00b11 phase consistent with the Levi-Civita symbol. And if any indices are identical, then Eq. (12) vanishes. This demonstrates Eq. (14) and completes the proof of the gauge invariance of the baryon operator. Notice this operator needs the gauge group to be special (its matrices having determinant 1).\nStarting from the operators in Eqs. (11) and (12), combining with more links to smear the source, or with Dirac matrices to connect with propagators in case we have dynamical quarks, we can build any operator and the respective correlators necessary to study hadrons. An example is shown in Fig. 7 (right) where with four Levi-Civita Symbols and a triple loop, we can construct the generalized Wilson loop to study the tetraquark static potential, detailed in Subsection 2.1.\nThere are three types of quarks used in the study of tetraquarks: the dynamical quarks, the nonrelativistic quarks and the static quarks. The most expensive quarks are the fully dynamical ones. Quarks are fermions and their field operators are Grassman variables. The path integral summation implies the computation of the determinant of the Dirac fermion matrix operator (Euclidian),\n\u03b3\u00b5(\u2202\u00b5 + iA\u00b5) +m (15)\nwhere the Dirac matrices are multiplied by a phase [136] to make them Hermitean \u03b3Ei = \u2212i\u03b3iM and \u03b3E4 = \u03b3 M 0 . Here we don\u2019t detail the terms necessary to avoid chiral doublers [152]. A solution to the problem of computing the determinant is in the use of pseudo-fermions, gauge fields with an action inverse to the fermion action. Moreover the generation of configurations with the hybrid Monte Carlo method is difficult with light quarks but this was solved using a preconditioner with a heavier mass. Possibly this is enabled by spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, who generated for the light quarks a constituent mass much larger than its bare mass, as detailed in Subsection 1.3.5. Moreover the deflation technique, factorizes the Dirac quark matrix in low energy modes and in high energy modes, where the low energy modes are the ones more sensitive to confinement and chiral symmetry breaking, and this also speeds up the necessary\ninversion of the fermion determinant. Then, for systems with light valence quarks we have to compute the quark propagators, inverse of the Dirac matrix in Eq. 15.\nFor the bottom quark, it is not yet possible to apply the dynamical quark approach. The bottom quark is quite heavy and would need too small lattice spacings. But we can use non-relativistic QCD which is less expensive on the lattice. In this case the Lagrangian is expanded in the velocity v, and only the leading orders are kept. Then the propagator is quadratic in the momentum and several of the dynamical quark problems are avoided. Davies et al [153] use an improved lattice NRQCD Hamiltonian [154]:\nH0 = \u2212 \u2206(2)\n2M0 (16)\n\u03b4H = \u2212c1 (\u2206(2))2\n8(M0)3 + c2\nig\n8(M0)3 (\u2206 \u00b7 E \u2212 E \u00b7\u2206)\u2212 c3\nig\n8(M0)3 \u03c3 \u00b7 (\u2206\u00d7 E\u0303 \u2212 E\u0303 \u00d7\u2206)\n\u2212c4 g\n2M0 \u03c3 \u00b7 B\u0303 + c5\na2\u2206(4) 24M0 \u2212 c6 a(\u03b4(2))2 16n(M0)2 . (17)\nWe thus get a Schr\u00f6dinger equation, with a quadratic kinetic energy, no doublers and we don\u2019t need to use a fine mesh lattice.\nAn even more economical approach, used for the computation of potentials, is the static quark approach, where the quarks are assumed to be infinitely heavy. As expected, an infinitely heavy quark sits in the same spatial point, just propagating in time. A simple example is the Wilson Loop, a rectangular loop with a pair of spatial sides and a pair of temporal sides. This loop is used to compute static potentials where the spatial distance is the distance between static charges and the temporal distance is the time used in the evolution of Eqs. 5 and 8. Besides, it is possible to compute the spin dependent potentials as well, as detailed in Subsection 3.2."

            "text": "The first computations for tetraquarks in lattice QCD used static quarks only, since static quarks are less expensive than dynamical quarks, and can be computed in pure gauge QCD. This effort was contemporary with the claimed observation of the \u03b8+ in 2003 [15], which at the time motivated more multiquark studies.\nLattice QCD computed potentials for tetraquarks and pentaquarks using static quarks, by Okiharu et al. [157, 144] and Alexandrou et al. [158]. The computations employ extended Wilson loops, including in each tetraquark operator two Levi-Civita symbols (one for each Steiner junction) to account for the diquarkantidiquark system, as in Fig. 7. Pentaquark operators have three Levi-Civita symbols. In particular Ref. [144] analyses in great detail the potential for different geometries of the four-quark system. The static potential is computed with generalized Wilson loops depicted in Fig. 7.\nThe authors find that this potential extends the the static QQ\u0304 potential which is well known from lattice QCD studies to be fitted by the expression [159]\nVQQ\u0304 = \u2212 \u03b1QQ\u0304 r + \u03c3QQ\u0304r + CQQ\u0304, (18)\nand the static QQQ potential which is presently understood to be the sum of the OGE Coulomb term and the Y or mercedes-benz star type linear confinement term as\nV3Q = \u2212\u03b13Q \u2211 i<j\n1\n|ri \u2212 rj | + \u03c33QLmin + C3Q. (19)\nIt was found by Fermat centuries ago that the minimal path Lmin connecting the three charges corresponds to an angle of 2\u03c0/3 (unless the charge triangle is too flat for that) between the three linear string segments, meeting at a Steiner junction. Initially there was a discussion on whether the confining potential was a sum of two-body linear potentials (a Delta shaped potential) [160, 161, 162, 163] or a single three body potential, since the difference between both potentials is subtle [164, 165]. The last lattice QCD [142, 143, 166] results show evidence for the string Y shaped potential of Eq. (19). Nevertheless it more lattice QCD results are welcome to definitely settle this discussion [164, 165].\nFor the QQQ\u0304Q\u0304 potential the authors find that the potential V4Q is described by the OGE Coulomb plus a four-body potential Vc4Q, with a double-Y or H extension of the three-body linear potential,\nV4Q = \u2212\u03b14Q{( 1\nr12 +\n1\nr34 ) +\n1 2 ( 1 r13 + 1 r14\n+ 1\nr23 +\n1\nr24 )}+ \u03c34QLmin + C4Q (20)\nwith rij \u2261 |ri \u2212 rj | and Lmin being the minimal value of the total flux-tube length. Here, ri denotes the location of ith (anti)quark. For the QQQQQ\u0304 potentials the authors find,\nV5Q = \u2212\u03b15Q{( 1\nr12 +\n1\nr34 ) +\n1 2 ( 1 r15 + 1 r25 + 1 r35 + 1 r45 )\n+ 1\n4 (\n1\nr13 +\n1\nr14 +\n1\nr23 +\n1\nr24 )}+ \u03c35QLmin + C5Q, (21)\nTogether with previous studies, the authors find these potentials are compatible, for the Coulomb potentials with the Casimir scaling present in the One Gluon Exchange potential and the OGE result for the Coulomb coefficient as\n\u03b1QQ\u0304 ' 2\u03b13Q ' 2\u03b14Q ' 2\u03b15Q ' 0.27 , (22)\nand for the Linear potentials with the flux tube picture, being fitted with universal parameters,\n\u03c3QQ\u0304 ' \u03c33Q ' \u03c34Q ' \u03c35Q ' (420MeV)2 . (23)\nAs for the constant shifts of each potential, they are non-scaling nonphysical quantities appearing in the lattice regularisation a, and we find an approximate relation as\nCQQ\u0304 2 ' C3Q 3 ' C4Q 4 ' C5Q 5 ' 0.32a\u22121 . (24)\nThen, after the Zc and the Zb tetraquarks were discovered with a large experimental significance, there was a new and more lasting interest in tetraquarks from lattice QCD. The colour electric and colour magnetic square field densities were studied with four static quarks, by Cardoso et al. [145, 167]. In Fig. 8 we show the QCD flux tube for a static tetraquark system. Clearly, It is a double-y potential with two Steiner junctions."

            "heading": "2.2. String flip-flop potentials with static quarks and the colour of mesons pairs and tetraquarks",
            "text": "In Subsection 2.1, we only considered the potential for tetraquarks corresponding to a 3\u0304 3 diquark tetraquarks. However, in the string picture, the lowest energy string, corresponding to the lowest energy potential, may also depend on the geometry of the system. This is considered in the string flip-flop potentials, utilized to study the decay of resonances. In some particular geometries, the lowest energy colour singlet may be the colour 1 1 of a meson-meson system, whereas in other geometries the lowest energy colour singlet may be the colour 3\u0304 3 of a diquark-antidiquark system. For instance we expect the meson-meson potential is energetically favoured when a quark is close to an antiquark, and the diquark tetraquark potential is favoured when the quarks (antiquarks) are close to each other.\nIn lattice QCD, the dependence of the potential on the positions of four quark systems has been studied. The string flip-flop was already observed in the first study of tetraquark potentials [144]. Then Cardoso et al [151] confirmed this flip-flop studying the flip-flop of the colour field densities, see Fig. 9.\nMoreover, to study a quantum system, not only the groundstate is important, the excitations are important as well. We also notice it is not sufficient to consider the spatial dependence of the potentials, it is necessary to consider colour as well. With such a system of two quarks and two antiquarks, there are two independent colour singlets. The orthogonal colour singlet to the 3\u0304 3 is the 6 6\u0304. And the orthogonal colour singlet to the 1 1 is the 8 8. Since, depending on the geometry of our system, we can have three different groundstate - two different 1 1 and one 3\u0304 3, the next excited state can also be in different colour states. Recently the computation, not only of the groundstate potential, but also of the first excited potential was performed [168]. Indeed, the flip-flop was observed both in the groundstate and in the excited potential. The mixing of both potentials in the transition region was also observed.\nImportantly the flip-flop was studied with dynamical QCD configurations [168]. The results, obtained both quenched and with dynamical QCD configurations are similar.\nHowever, it turns out that, when applying the string flip-flop potential in the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for such a four body system [112], more bound state tetraquarks of the type Tbb, discussed in Subsection 2.3 are obtained than the ones computed with lattice QCD. Possibly this excess of states occurs because the potentials extracted from lattice QCD don\u2019t include yet the spin-dependent terms, which would disfavour the isovector tetraquark which light quarks have a combined spin1. The computation of such terms in lattice QCD is discussed in Subsection 3.2.\n2.3. Potentials with static heavy quarks Q\u0304Q\u0304 and dynamical light quarks for the TQQ family of tetraquarks The first confirmation of observed tetraquarks, of the z family shown in Table 2, led to new efforts to compute tetraquarks with lattice QCD. The first lattice QCD evidence of tetraquarks was obtained for the TQQ family of tetraquarks, which is less difficult technically because the channels are just B-B channels, we don\u2019t have to deal with the mixing of different channels. The new lattice QCD evidence motivated many studies of the Tbb, Tbbs, Tcb, Tcc . . . reported in Table 3. The first lattice computations for Tbb and related states utilized static potentials computed with static heavy quarks and dynamical light quarks. The dynamics provided to the heavy quarks in the Schr\u00f6dinger equation with the Born-Oppenheimer approximation [169] led to the prediction of boundstates.\nStatic quarks have a fixed position, they are convenient for the study of potentials as a function of distance. They provide a good approximation in the case of heavy quarks. A very interesting system to study is the family of TQQ tetraquarks with two heavy antiquarks and two light quarks, of the class proposed by Richard many years ago. These tetraquarks couple to systems of two heavy-light mesons. Using static heavy antiquarks, they couple to two static-light mesons.\nIn lattice QCD, the study of this family of potentials was initiated with quenched quarks for the light quarks [170, 171, 172, 173]. More recently, Wagner and others Refs. [155, 156, 174, 74], extended this to dynamical light quarks, obtained with a comprehensive set of four quark operators of for instance of the form\n(C\u0393)AB ( Q\u0304C(r1)\u03c8 (1) A (r1) )( Q\u0304C(r2)\u03c8 (2) B (r2) ) , (25)\nwhere Q\u0304 denotes a static quark operator, \u03c8 a light antiquark operator, A, B and C are spin indices and C = \u03b30\u03b32 is the charge conjugation matrix [155, 156]. With these operators it is possible to consider\ndifferent light isospin I and spin S for the light quarks, with the dynamical potentials we can address full QCD. More recently heavy quark spin effects were partly included [66], the extrapolation to the chiral limit was performed [63] and the light quarks were extended from the u, d flavours to the s and c flavours [62].\nWe will now analyse in detail the results with dynamical quarks of Refs. [155, 156], illustrated in Fig. 10. To be applied to the Schr\u00f6dinger Equation, it is convenient to fit with an ansatz the points and error bars resulting from the lattice QCD computation [61]. The result of the fit is illustrated in Fig. 11.\nTo fit the potential points with a curve an ansatz was needed. Educated by what is known from QCD, asymptotic freedom at small distances and infrared slavery at large distances, a Coulomb potential is expected at short distances. The the two heavy antiquarks are then in the groundstate if they are in a triplet colour state 3, s-wave and thus must have a symmetric spin 1. At large distances, a screening typical of the static-light wavefunction is expected. It is sketched in Fig. 12 from Ref. [61], say Gaussian or exponential. The ansatz with best fit was found as,\nV (r) = \u2212\u03b1 r exp ( \u2212 ( r d )p) . (26)\nThe error bar of the fit is reflected in the band in the plot of Fig. 11. Results are summarized in Table 5. To search for boundstates and compute the respective wavefunction the potentials are included in the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The infinite mass limit is relaxed with a finite heavy mass, saymb or (less satisfactory) mc, either the quark mass (bare current mass or the constituent mass used in quark models) or the B meson mass which are relatively similar. Extrapolating to the physical pion mass, [61, 62, 63, 66, 64, 65], a binding energy of \u221290 \u00b1 43 MeV was predicted. Partly including the effect of the spin of the heavy antiquarks reduced binding slightly to \u221260\u00b145 MeV, in the binding channel of a BB\u2217. Other tetraquarks such as lsb\u0304b\u0304, lcb\u0304b\u0304, scb\u0304b\u0304, llc\u0304b\u0304, llc\u0304c\u0304 did not bind in this approach, but a p-wave resonance with the same flavour was also predicted, if one ignores the heavy spin effects.\nImportantly, the quantum numbers predicted for the Tbb are I(JP ) = 0(1+). To understand the quantum numbers, It is sufficient to consider the small distance r, where the heavy quarks have spin 1. The light quarks are in a scalar-isoscalar state. Moreover the parity, with two quarks and an antiquark in s-waves is +."

            "heading": "2.4. Tetraquark and meson-meson bounstate structure with a generalized eigenvalue problem",
            "text": "In Ref. [65], lattice QCD was utilized to compare two frequently discussed competing structures for a tetraquark: the diquark tetraquark versus the molecular one. The considered tetraquark is the exotic b\u0304b\u0304ud system with quantum numbers I(JP ) = 0(1+). This boundstate has been confirmed by different first principles lattice QCD computations, as refered in Subsections 2.3, 4.1.1, 4.1.2.\nIn Ref. [65], the authors considered meson-meson as well as diquark-antidiquark creation operators. They also used the static-light approximation of Subsections 2.3 and 4.1.1, where the two b\u0304 quarks are assumed to be infinitely heavy with frozen positions, while the light u and d quarks are fully relativistic, with dynamical configurations.\nBy minimizing effective energies and by solving a generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP), they determined the importance of the meson-meson and the diquark-antidiquark creation operators with respect to the ground state. The first type of creation operators, also used in [155, 156, 62, 63], excites two B mesons at separation r,\nOBB,\u0393 = 2NBB(C\u0393)AB(C\u0393\u0303)CD ( Q\u0304aC(r1)\u03c8 (f)a A (r1) )( Q\u0304bD(r2)\u03c8 (f \u2032)b B (r2) ) (27)\nwhere r = |r2 \u2212 r1| is the separation between the heavy antiquarks. The colour indices are a, b, spin indices are A,B,C,D and \u03c8(f)\u03c8(f\n\u2032) = ud \u2212 du. NBB is a normalisation. There are two independent choices for the light spin matrix \u0393 consistent with (jz,P,Px) = (0,\u2212,+). \u0393 = (1 + \u03b30)\u03b35 predominantly excites two negative parity ground state mesons B(\u2217)B(\u2217), while \u0393 = (1 \u2212 \u03b30)\u03b35 mostly generates two positive parity excited mesons B\u22170,1B\u22170,1. Since static spins have no effect on energy levels, the heavy spin matrix is irrelevant and can be chosen arbitrarily, \u0393\u0303 \u2208 {(1\u2212\u03b30)\u03b35, (1\u2212\u03b30)\u03b3j}. The second type of creation operators, resembles a diquark-antidiquark pair with heavy quarks separated by r and connected by a gluonic string,\nODd,\u0393 = \u2212NDd abc ( \u03c8 (f)b A (z)(C\u0393)AB\u03c8 (f \u2032)c B (z) ) ade ( Q\u0304fC(r1)U fd(r1; z)(C\u0393\u0303)CDQ\u0304gD(r2)Uge(r2; z) ) . (28)\nAgain NDd is a normalisation and the allowed light and heavy spin matrices are the same as for the operator OBB,\u0393, i.e. \u0393 \u2208 {(1 \u2212 \u03b30)\u03b35, (1 + \u03b30)\u03b35} and \u0393\u0303 \u2208 {(1 \u2212 \u03b30)\u03b35, (1 \u2212 \u03b30)\u03b3j}. For definiteness, \u0393\u0303 = (1 \u2212 \u03b30)\u03b33 was chosen.\nNotice these operators are not orthogonal, they have the same quantum numbers. At R = 0 the diquarkantidiquark operator is exactly identical to the meson-meson operator and when distance increases, the overlap decreases. For instance, to compute the energy of the tetraquark, they are not both necessary, since in lattice QCD it is sufficient to have an operator with a good overlap with the wavefunction of the studied physical state. Nevertheless the relevance of each operator for the wavefunction can be determined. Wen we have non-orthogonal operators, we solve a GEVP. The application of a GEVP to lattice QCD problems is reviewed in Ref. [175].\nRef. [65] concludes the diquark-antidiquark structure of the tetraquark dominates for b\u0304b\u0304 separations r \u2264 0.25 fm, whereas it becomes increasingly more irrelevant for larger separations, where the I(JP ) = 0(1+) tetraquark is mostly a meson-meson system. This is shown in Fig. 13. The estimated meson-meson to diquark-antidiquark ratio of this tetraquark is around 60% to 40%. Moreover for the light quarks, the spinor matrix (1 + \u03b30)\u03b35 dominates.\nIn what concerns the type of tetraquark, the attraction is provided when the system is at shortest distances in a diquark tetraquark, according to Eq. (26) and Table 5 but the wavefunction also extends outside this short distance region and then the system is in a molecular tetraquark."

            "text": "String breaking is an important aspect of the decay of hadrons and of hadronisation. When two quarks are pulled to large distances, the string picture fails. It is as though the string would break and at the breaking point a quark-antiquark pair would be created.\nString breaking in lattice gauge theory [177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198] was first observed in simpler theories than QCD. However, it initially failed to be observed in the static quark-antiquark potential with SU(3) gauge fields and with dynamical quarks. Just using a simple Wilson loop may be insufficient for the string breaking to be visible in the quark-antiquark potential.\nTo be clearly observed, the string breaking studies needed to explicitly include the coupling of the two static quark systems to a four quark system (two static and two dynamical). Although this system doesn\u2019t have exotic quantum numbers, it is useful to study cypto-exotic tetraquarks. The coupled potentials between in a static quark-antiquark channel and two static-light mesons have been computed by Bali et al. [176] with two light u and d flavours and by Bulava et al. [199] with three light u, d and s flavours. The corresponding string breaking potential for Ref. [176] and first excited state, showing the crossing of the quarkonium and meson-meson potentials, is illustrated in Fig. 14 (left).\nMoreover, Bali et al. [176] showed that the static quarkonium operator and the meson-meson operator have a very small overlap. This enables the computation of the mixing angle between the quarkonium and meson-meson basis and the basis of the two eigenvectors. With the mixing angle, it is possible to compute the potentials for the quarkonium, for the meson-meson system and the respective mixing potential between these two channels, illustrated in Fig. 15. These potentials constitute the matrix elements of a non-diagonal matrix potentials, in the Fock space, including the quarkonium and the meson-meson subspaces. For instance for s-wave quarkonium,\nV0(r) = ( VQ\u0304Q(r) Vmix(r) Vmix(r) VM\u0304M,\u2016(r) ) (29)\nUsing the Born-Oppenheimer diabatic approximation, extending Subsection 2.3, this matrix of potentials has been used to study the decay of quarkonium to meson-meson channels, determining the poles of the bottomonium resonances [200, 201, 202, 203].\nThe advantage of this approach compared to having a full lattice QCD computation with non-relativistic quarks is that many levels of quarkonium can be addressed, and that we are able to explore the s matrix in the Riemann sheets of complex energies. Possibly this technique can be extended to study the I = 1 channel, including the Zb family of tetraquarks, extending the technique used in Ref. [204] for the Zc family, with potentials detailed in Subsection 2.6.\nThe drawback is that, in lattice QCD, we have not yet accounted for the heavy quark spin effects, as detailed in Subsection 3.2. These effects may shift up to 100 MeV the masses computed with static heavy quarks. Besides, with static potentials, only the bottomonium spectrum can be addressed, whereas for the charmonium spectrum, including the very interesting X(3872) resonance, more terms in the relativistic expansion are necessary. Besides, new more precise lattice QCD computations of the potentials are necessary to determine in more detail the bottomonium spectrum with this technique.\nImportantly, compared to the pure quarkonium spectrum, two extra states are found, in the S and D spectra [202, 203]. Moreover, both these states have a dominant meson-meson component shown in Fig. 15 and masses compatible with the recent \u03a5(10753) resonance observed at BELLE [34], referred in Table 1.\nThese states are then s pole tetraquarks. Notice, with the potential matrix in Eq. (29), it is possible to derive the Lippmann-Schwinger series for the T matrix of Fig. 6. This approach is expected to produce results comparable with the L\u00fcscher technique for phase shifts, say for the study of the X(3872 in Subsection 2.10."

This is the case of the Zb family of tetraquarks, see Table 2, with flavour ud\u0304bb\u0304. Then, if the potentials are clearly identified, the Born-Oppenheimer can also be applied and the respective boundstates or resonances can be studied by solving the quantum mechanics equations. However this Zb case is more difficult to address than the case of 2.3 where the heavy pair is a Q\u0304Q\u0304, say for a tetraquark with flavour udb\u0304b\u0304. Then, at large distances where the strong interactions between hadrons are screened, we only had one meson-meson pair, with flavour ub\u0304 and db\u0304, a B+(\u2217)B0(\u2217) pair.\nIn the present Zb case we have two possible flavours for the meson-meson pairs, either the pair ub\u0304 = B+ (\u2217)\nand d\u0304b = B\u03040 (\u2217)\nor the pair ud\u0304 and bb\u0304, say corresponding to a meson \u03c0+ and a quarkonium meson such as an \u03a5. We must have at least two coupled channels, one with the pair B+(\u2217) B\u03040 (\u2217) and another with the\npair \u03c0+ \u03a5. The difficulty resides in identifying the different open coupled channels, and in the number of coupled channels, because the different channels are not orthogonal.\nThe first study was worked out by Peters et al considering the channel of the BB\u0304 meson pair only [206, 207]. The authors found evidence for a boundstate due to an attractive potential between the two mesons. However to complete the study it would be necessary to include the second coupled channel, with a pion and a bottomonium state. This second channel is the open channel where the resonance decays to.\nThe second study already includes the two meson-meson coupled channels, by Prelovsek et al. [208, 205, 209]. The first step is the computation of the potentials, as a function of the distance between the heavy QQ\u0304, considered static. This is similar to the technique of Section 2.5, where we aim to get the potential for each channel and the mixing potential between the considered channels. Then this can be addressed with quantum mechanics techniques to compute the scattering matrix.\nAnother interesting lattice QCD approach by Alberti et al [210] considered the composed system denominated hadroquarkonium [211]. This combines a quarkonium composed by a static quark-antiquark pair together with an extra light hadron composed of dynamical quarks. In this Ref. [210], several cases of mesons - not just the pion - and baryons are considered as the extra hadron.\nBut having an extra light meson leads to an extra difficulty, which in a sense is overlooked in the hadroquarkonium: the light hadron may have any possible momentum. Refs. [208, 205, 209] go one step further by considering some of the first momenta of the light meson \u03c0, as shown in Fig. 16 . Moreover in [209], the four different quantum numbers \u03a3+g , \u03a3\u2212g , \u03a3+u , \u03a3\u2212u in the notation of the symmetry group of homonuclear molecules, defined in Subsection 3.3, resulting from the coupling of the light meson and the static quarkonium are considered, resulting in four different types of potentials.\nNevertheless there is still one technical detail to be solved in this approach. To apply quantum mechanical techniques, the non-orthogonality of the different channels and the mixing angle between them and the eigenvalues of the potential matrix remain to be fully addressed."

            "text": "With static sources one computed directly the position dependent potentials in lattice QCD, see Subsections 2.3 and 2.6. The HAL QCD method extends this technique to quarks with dynamics [212, 213, 214]. This has been previously applied to study the \u03c0\u2212\u03c0 scattering and the N \u2212N interaction. In particular the short range repulsive core, the medium range attraction, and the long range OPEP discussed in Subsection\n1.3 have been computed, in agreement with the phenomenological N \u2212N interactions. Very recently it has been applied to study the Tbb tetraquark by Aoki [72].\nThe first step consists in computing the wavefunction / Nambu-Bethe-Salpeter amplitude for systems of two hadrons, each one composed of quarks. On the lattice, this is computed with a pair of quark operators. Then the respective potential is derived from the BS amplitude. To understand the concept, consider for instance the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, which is a non-relativistic and instantaneous limit of the Nambu-BetheSalpeter equation, [\n\u2212\u2206\u03c6(r) 2m + V (r)\n] \u03c6(r) = E \u03c6(r) , (30)\nit implies we can determine the potential from the wavefunction \u03c6 of the hadron pair and its energy E,\nV (r) = \u2206\u03c6(r)\n2m\u03c6(r) + E . (31)\nFrom the basic principles of this example, it is possible to extend the technique to the relativistic and time dependent systems considered by HAL QCD.\nIt is first necessary to get the best possible wavefunction for each one of the hadrons. This is obtained variationally, with an ansatze for the lattice QCD operator with the correct quantum numbers of the respective hadron. Then the parameters in the ansatze, for instance the smearing radius, are optimized to produce the largest signal for the groundstate exponential in Eq. (7), corresponding to the largest overlap c0. This also corresponds to the best signal over noise ratio in the effective mass plot for the groundstate energy in Eq. (8). Then these wavefunctions are used as a source or sink for the hadron-hadron wavefunction \u03c6(r) at separation r.\nIn Ref. [72] for the Tbb study, a 2\u00d72 time dependent coupled channel was studied. The coupled channels employed asymptotic channels with pairs of B and B\u2217 mesons. A diquark-antidiquark operator was also added to the operator set. For the light quarks, dynamical fermions were used and and for the bottom quarks, non-relativistic fermions were used, as in Subsection 2.9. In this work, chiral extrapolation to the physical pion mass was also performed.\nThis work was able to obtain the potentials with dynamic light quarks and non-relativistic heavy quarks. The potentials are shown in Fig. 17, for the 2\u00d7 2 coupled channel system of a BB\u2217 pair and a B\u2217B\u2217 pair\n. They are in general comparable to the potentials obtained with static quarks in the same 2 \u00d7 2 coupled channel system of Ref. [66], where they are denominated Vj and V5, as detailed in Subsection 3.2 and shown in Fig. 26 (right). Notice the potentials of Ref. [72] are quite recent, with more points, smaller errors and a wider range of distances r. Observing in detail the HAL QCD potentials, there is evidence for some OPEP attraction in the B\u2217B\u2217 pair, which has not yet been seen in the static potentials. This is an interesting result, possibly showing evidence of forces of both gluon-exchange OGEP and meson-exchange OPEP type."

[217, 215], Guerrieri et al. [218] and Cheung et al. [219]. The authors used the technique of comparing the spectrum just with several meson-meson operators, and the spectrum after adding diquark-antidiquark operators. Representative examples of the many employed interpolators are\nO\u03c8(0)\u03c0(0)1 = c\u0304\u03b3ic(0) d\u0304\u03b35u(0) (32)\nfor meson meson operators, and for the diquark-antidiquark operators, similar to Eq.

(33)\nNotice, in other cases this same technique may succeed in identifying hadrons, for instance Ref. [220] were able to identify the X(3872) state in the spectrum.\nHowever no evidence for the Zc was found in the spectrum. For instance the authors of Ref. [217] searched for this state on the lattice by simulating the channel with JPC = 1+\u2212 and I = 1, but they did not find a candidate for Zc+(3900). Instead, they only find discrete scattering states DD\u0304\u2217 and J/\u03c8\u03c0+, shown in Fig. 18, which inevitably have to be present in a dynamical QCD computation.\nNotice the Zc tetraquarks are resonances, with a decay width corresponding to a complex pole of the S matrix, and it is not a priori certain that they can be identified in the midst of a real energy spectrum. Moreover they are high in the spectrum and are coupled to a large number of decaying channels which makes them more difficult to identify.\nThus the numerous tetraquarks and pentaquarks of the Z family so far escape evidence from lattice QCD computations. A possible explanation is in Fig. 13 (right) we borrow from Ref. [65]. In this example, there is a large overlap between the meson-meson operators and the diquark-antidiquark operator. This may explain why adding diquark-antidiquark operators to the operator set does not change the spectrum in a noticeable way."

Indeed the simplest state to identify in a spectrum is the groundstate, such as boundstate lying below the continuum states.\nAfter the Tbb lattice QCD predictions by Bicudo and Wagner [61] using static quarks and the BornOppenheimer adiabatic approximation, a more precise approach was applied to search for bound states in the Tbb system with two light quarks and two heavy bottom antiquarks. Notice the standard lattice QCD dynamical quark technique cannot yet be applied to bottom quarks who are too heavy. The mesh of the present lattices is too wide for full dynamical bottom quarks. Bottom quarks are then implemented in lattice QCD with a non-relativistic approximation, which solves two problems of the static quarks. The potentials computed with static quarks are purely spin scalar, and important potentials such as the hyperfine potentials are not computed. Besides when providing a kinetic energy to the heavy quarks, it is not clear wether to use the quark mass from quark models or the meson mass.\nThe Tbb fully exotic tetraquark has been studied by Francis et al. [68], Leskovec et al. [70] and Junnarkar et al. [57]. These authors uses the NRQCD lattice action [221, 222, 223, 162, 224] to calculate bottom quark\npropagators. For instance, the Hamiltonian used in Ref.

The first term should provide results similar to the ones computed with static potentials.\nAll the lattice QCD computations agree that there is a bound Tbb tetraquark, and most likely a bound Tbbs as well. While there there was some tension in the initial value of the binding energy, presently the results of the different lattice QCD groups tend to agree, see Table 3. Where there is still some tension is in the other quantum numbers of this family of tetraquarks, where in general Ref. [57] tends to find binding in Tcc, Tccs and Tbbc where the other groups don\u2019t. The later group employed the chiral extrapolation to the physical m\u03c0, and the continuum limit to vanishing a , only the thermodynamic limit with large volumes remain to be checked. This is illustrated in Fig. 19 for the tetraquarks Tcc and Tccs.\nAlso notice Hughes et al found a null evidence for a full bottom tetraquark boundstate in Ref. [227]. In the case of Tbc the situation is not clear yet on wether Lattice QCD predicts binding or not. [60, 59]."

            "text": "In the previous Subsections, the main computation to study tetraquarks consisted in computing a energy spectrum, with the effective mass plot technique of Eq. (8). Either we would directly compute the energy of the tetraquark or first compute a potential (energy of static quarks) to use it with the Born-Oppenheimer approximation in a Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\nHowever the previous techniques do not allow to study directly scattering and resonances in lattice QCD. Here we review another technique to compute the phase shifts of the scattering matrix with lattice QCD.\nAs a basic example, let us consider for instance a non-relativistic particle with a potential V in a D=1 dimensional space. In the continuum the particle wave-function suffers a phase shift, as a function of its momentum k = \u221a 2mE due to the potential. At large enough distance for the potential (assumed compact) to be negligible, the wavefunction is proportional to \u03c6k(x) = exp[ikx+ i\u03b4(k)], where \u03b4(k) is the phase shift. Clearly when V is attractive the phase shift is negative (we have more oscillations within the potential zone) and vice-versa. The scattering length is defined as a = ddk \u03b4(k), in the case of a repulsive potential it provides the effective size of a hard target equivalent to the potential.\nLet us now sketch how this can be of interest in the case of a lattice (assuming a small lattice spacing), say like a finite box of length L with periodic boundary conditions. In the free and non-relativistic case, with no potential, the periodic wavefunctions are\n\u03c6n(x) = exp[iknx] , kn = n 2\u03c0\nL , (35)\ncorresponding to an energy\nEn = k2\n2m = n2\n2\u03c02\nmL2 (36)\nhowever, with the potential, the wavefunctions at large distance from the potential have a phase shift and then the periodic boundary condition forces the standing waves to comply with the condition\nkL+ 2\u03b4(k) = n2\u03c0\nEn = n 2 2\u03c0\n2\nm(L+ 2\u03b4(k))2 . (37)\nThus, in this trivial example, once we measure the energy levels, we are able to compute the phase shifts for a discrete set of energies, determined by the box size. An order of magnitude of the splitting between the levels, say for a mass m of the order of 1 GeV, and a lattice size of 1 to 2 fm, is 0.19 n2 GeV to 0.77 n2 GeV. To determine the phase shift at several energies one has to consider different box sizes.\nIn the real case of QCD one has at least two particles interacting. Moreover this basic idea has successfully be extended to 3 spatial dimensions, with angular momentum and spin, and to relativistic particles, by L\u00fcscher et al and then by others, [228, 229, 228, 230, 231, 232, 233]. Moreover the extension to several channels and to three particle resonances is under development by Hansen et al, [234, 235, 236]. For instance in the case of a single channel with two particles, using the effective range approach [237] it is\npossible to measure in lattice QCD\nk2l+1 cot \u03b4l(k) = \u22121 al + rl 2 k2 + o(k4) (38)\nand parametrize it with the scattering length al and the effective range rl [238]. where the condition for having a pole in the S = ei 2\u03b4l matrix is equivalent to cot \u03b4l + i = 0. Once this has been implemented, and the statistical and systematic errors are under control, the first scattering cases have been studied in lattice QCD.\nVery recently the first fully exotic tetraquark to be observed, the Tcc was studied in the channel DD\u2217, see Ref. [58] by Padmanath and Prelovsek. Well before its observation, it was already studied with the phase shift technique by Ykeda et al [240] who did not find any boundstate or resonance. The determination of the channels of Ref. [58] is illustrated in Fig. 20. However, using the effective range approach, shown in Fig. 21, so far only a virtual boundstate pole was found, not yet the Tcc experimental resonance pole, because both parameters a0 and r0 in Eq. (38) are positive. In this case there is a solution for a pole with purely imaginary momentum, but with Im(k) < 0, whereas for a boundstate we should have Im(k) > 0.\nMoreover, In Refs. [72, 59] the scattering of a pair of pairs of B and B\u2217 mesons was also studied, and in these cases a boundstate for the Tbb was clearly obtained with the effective range approach. The binding energy is compatible with the results shown in Subsections 2.1 and 2.9."

            "text": "Besides the studies we reviewed of the exotic tetraquarks Tcc and Tbb with the L\u00fcscher phase shift technique in Subsection 2.10, there are as well some very interesting studies of systems with crypto-exotic tetraquarks using this technique.\nThere are two different types of crypto-exotic systems with four quark components, as detailed in Subsection 1.3.6, the molecular tetraquarks and the s pole tetraquarks. We define the crypto-exotics as systems with a dominant four quark component, but with quantum numbers that are not exotic. While the molecular tetraquarks are essentially a two-meson system, the s pole tetraquarks also have a simple meson component, but this is component is small.\nMoreover there as as well non-exotics. We define the non-exotics as systems where the meson system is dominant, but it couples to meson-meson channels. In particular when it is above the respective threshold\nit may decay to a meson-meson channel. For instance, in Subsection 2.5, using string breaking potentials, it was concluded the \u03a5(10753) observed at Belle is a crypto-exotic because it is mostly composed of B(\u2217)B\u0304(\u2217) and B(\u2217)s B\u0304 (\u2217) s , while the other \u03a5(nS) are non-exotic bottomonium because they are mostly composed of bb\u0304 components. In what concerns non-exotic charmonium-like resonances, they were studied with DD\u0304 coupled channels first for JPC = 1\u2212\u2212 and 3\u2212\u2212 [241] in agreement with experiment. Then, in the coupled channel of DD\u0304 and DsD\u0304s, the charmonium-like resonances with JPC = 0++ and 2++ were studied in Ref. [239], finding interesting new resonances. The authors found a previously unobservedDD\u0304 bound state just below threshold and a DD\u0304 resonance likely related to \u03c7c0(3860), which is believed to be \u03c7c0(2P ). In addition, they found an indication for a narrow 0++ resonance just below the DsD\u0304s threshold with a large coupling to DsD\u0304s and a very small coupling to DD\u0304. This resonance is possibly related to the narrow X(3915)/\u03c7c0(3930) observed in experiment also just below DsD\u0304s. The partial wave l = 2 features a resonance likely related to \u03c7c2(3930. The search for a pole using the phase shift in the effective range approach is illustrated in Fig. 22.\nThe most famous candidate for crypto-exotic tetraquark X(3872) was studied in the coupled channels DD\u2212\u2217 and J/\u03a8\u03c9 by Prelovsek et al [242]. A candidate for the charmonium-like state X(3872) was found 11 \u00b1 7 MeV below the DD\u2212\u2217 threshold using dynamical Nf=2 lattice simulation with JPC = 1++ and I = 0, similar in mass to another lattice QCD search [243]. This state was again studied together with the resonance Y (4140) in Ref. [220]. This computation confirmed the X(3872) with a mass closer to the threshold, but found no evidence for the Y (4140).\nThe candidates for charmed \u03c0 and K molecule candidates with D and Ds quantum numbers have also been studied by Mohler et al [244], Refs. [245, 246]. Studying scattering in the D\u03c0 channels, the authors computed the masses and widths of the broad scalar D0*(2400) and the axial D1(2430), and reproduced the experiment. In the DK scattering, the D\u2217s0(2317) is found 37(17) MeV below the DK threshold, close to the experiment value of 45 MeV, in a lattice simulation of the JP = 0+ channel using both DK as well as sc\u0304 interpolating fields. The Ds1(2460) is also found as a strong interaction bound state 44(10) MeV below the D\u2217K threshold, which is in agreement with the experiment. The narrow resonances Ds1(2536) and D\u2217s2(2573) are also found close to the experimental masses. These studies have been further continued by Refs. [247, 248].\nHowever, more recently and using as well the scattering technique, Alexandrou et al [249] found that the dominant component of the D\u2217s0(2317) is a qq\u0304 component, not a tetraquark one. Thus they find it is a\nregular meson and not a s pole tetraquark. Searching for bottomed K molecules with Bs quantum numbers, Lang et al [250] first verified they reproduced the experimentally observed states Bs1(5830) and B\u2217s2(5840). They also predicted a new molecule: a JP = 0+ bound state Bs0 with mass of 5.711\u00b1 32 GeV. This state is a bottomed partner of the charmed one."

            "text": "The all-static potentials studies of pentaquarks are already referred in Subsection 2.1. They have been computed at the same time as the all static potentials for tetraquarks. These static potentials [144, 158] are also consistent with the potentials computed for mesons and baryons: they have a sum of two-body Coulomb terms with a Casimir operator scaling, a constant term proportional to the number of quarks, and a confining potential with three junctions, detailed in Eq. (21). In Fig. 23 we represent the Lagrangian field density produced by pentaquark static sources.\nMany lattice QCD studies of light pentaquarks [251, 252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266] were performed just after the \u03b8+ event in 2003, [15] which, however, was finally not confirmed by other experiments. These works, after searching for resonances in different K \u2212 N channels, reached different conclusions, most of them preliminary, on the \u03b8+ resonance existence: yes [251, 253, 258, 259, 260, 263], maybe [254, 257, 261, 262, 265], no [252, 255, 256, 264, 266]. Most of theses studies utilized the technique, referred in subsection 2.8, of searching for states directly in the midst of the meson-baryon spectrum, which often is inconclusive.\nAs discussed for the tetraquarks in Section 2, there are two more able techniques to identify resonances: either the computation of potentials for static heavy quarks and dynamical light quarks, or the study of meson-baryon scattering with the L\u00fcscher phase shift technique.\nWe now review the techniques and results applied to the to the pentaquarks of the Pc family, which include a cc\u0304 heavy quark pair. These pentaquarks started to be observed recently, as summarized in Table 4.\nUsing the hadroquarkonium picture [210], already referred in Subsection 2.6, Alberti et al considered the static quark-antiquark QQ\u0304 (mQ \u2192 \u221e closer to b than to c) as function of distance between Q\u0304 and Q in presence of the nucleon. The energy was shifted down by a few MeV, compatible with a molecular boundstate.\nBeane et al [267], considering a very heavy m\u03c0 ' 800 MeV in J = 12 \u2212 (G\u22121 ) channel of N\u03b7c, found a boundstate with binding energy \u2206E \u2248 \u221220 MeV, which was almost independent of the volume L ' 3.4\u22126.7 fm [267]. Such a boundstate would be very interesting but it remains to be confirmed for a physical pion mass.\nSkerbis and Prelovsek [269, 270] utilized the technique of studying the spectrum with a large set of correlators. They simulated the NJ/\u03c8 and N\u03b7c levels in the lattice at m\u03c0 ' 266 MeV in channels with all possible JP . This includes JP = 3/2\u00b1 and 5/2\u00b1 where LHCb discovered Pc(4380) and Pc(4450) pentaquark states in proton\u2212J/\u03c8 decay. However they found no evidence for any Pc pentaquark in the spectrum amongst these two-body channels. However, they have not yet applied the L\u00fcscher phase shift technique to their scattering states.\nTwo studies computed the potential between N and J/\u03c8 or \u03b7c in a s-wave as a function of distance using the HAL QCD method, in a quenched [271] and in a dynamical [272] simulation. The light-quark mass was larger than physical with m\u03c0 = 640\u2212 870 MeV in [271] and the nucleon mass mN ' 1.8 GeV in [272]. They find weakly-attractive interaction near threshold in three channels explored: JP = 12 \u2212 , 32 \u2212 for NJ/\u03c8 and 1 2\n\u2212 for N\u03b7c. The resulting interaction was not strong enough to form bound states or resonances, but the most interesting experimental region 4.3\u2212 4.5 GeV was not explored.\nThe s-wave scattering between a nucleon N and J/\u03c8(\u03b7c) was already studied some time ago, using the L\u00fcscher formalism in quenched [273] and dynamical [274] QCD. All calculated scattering lengths a0, were found consistent with zero but only within 1 or 2 sigma, while implying a small attractive interaction.\nVery recently, Xing et al [268] finally claimed tetraquark resonances with the L\u00fcscher scattering technique. The s-wave scattering of \u03a3cD\u0304 and \u03a3cD\u0304\u2217 in the I(JP ) = 12 ( 1 2 \u2212 ) channel was calculated with different volumes and already a lower pion mass M\u03c0 \u223c 294MeV than previous studies. The effective range method, illistrated in Fig. 24 led to bound state poles in both \u03a3cD\u0304 and \u03a3cD\u0304\u2217 channels with respective binding energies of 6\u00b1 4MeV and 7\u00b1 4MeV. However these channels have the same quantum numbers as the channels pJ/\u03c8 or p\u03b7c or \u039bcD\u0304\u2217 which have a lighter energy threshold; this study may possibly be observing an evidence of the neglected channels. Thus this study is not absolutely conclusive, a study with all coupled channels should be the next step for a definitive result.\nNevertheless the pentaquark studies in lattice QCD are perhaps more promising than the tetraquark ones, since for instance the Pc decay channels are much closer in energy and reduced mass that the decay channels of the Zc which may include a \u03c0."

            "heading": "3.2. Spin dependent potentials and spin effects in diquarks",
            "text": "There is a missing ingredient in the lattice QCD potentials studies for tetraquarks: the spin dependent interactions. While they have already been computed for mesons, they have not yet been computed for baryons or tetraquarks. Nevertheless we details the studies of spin dependent potentials for mesons, since quark-antiquark pairs are relevant for tetraquarks.\nThere are also studies of diquarks, who indirectly probe the spin effects in quark-quark pairs. In this subsection we also address the diquark studies in lattice QCD.\nThere are some lattice QCD studies of spin-dependent interactions in mesonic quark-antiquark systems [276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281, 282, 283, 284, 285, 286, 275, 287, 66]. Most of the observed tetraquark candidates are expected to be groundstate tetraquarks, in s-waves. In this case, of all the spin-dependent potentials, only the hyperfine term contributes. This hyperfine term of the quark-antiquark potential in mesons is,\nVhyp(r) = + ~s1 \u00b7 ~s2 3m1m2\n( c (1) F c (2) F V4(r)\u2212 48\u03c0CF\u03b1sdv\u03b4(3)(r) ) , (39)\nwhere \u03b1s = g2/(4\u03c0) is the strong coupling, CF = 4/3 is the Casimir charge of the fundamental representation and dv is the mixing coefficient of the four-quark operator in the (p)NRQCD Lagrangian. In Eq. (39), the Dirac delta term is due to the perturbative OGEP already mentioned in Subsection 1.3. The delta term cannot be computed in lattice QCD which is adequate only at distances larger than the lattice spacing a. Moreover it is puzzling since, in the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, say added to a funnel potential, the delta term\nproduces a solution collapsing to origin, with minus infinity energy. Thus the effective quark models either only use the delta term perturbatively (just shifting the energy of the groundstate obtained with the funnel potential) or use a smeared version of the delta potential [288] or of the Coulomb potential [107].\nBesides, in Eq. (39), c(i)F (\u00b5,mi) (i = 1, 2) is the matching coefficient in the (p)NRQCD Lagrangian which multiplies the term ~\u03c3 \u00b7 ~B/(2mi) and this coefficient plays an important role when connecting QCD at a scale \u00b5 with (p)NRQCD at scales mi. When the matching is performed at tree-level of perturbation theory, the coefficient is c(i)F = 1 [223] and Eq. (39) is reduced to the expression given in Refs. [289, 290, 291].\nThe V4(r) contribution to the potential has been computed in lattice QCD by Koma and Koma [275], the result is shown in Fig. 25. To fit the lattice data, the authors used the ansatz,\nV4;fit(r) = \u2212g\u2032m2g e\u2212mgr\nr + 4 \u03c3v4 r , (40)\nwith a repulsive Coulomb term and an attractive screened Coulomb term motivated by the exchange of a pseudoscalar glueball with assumed mg = 2.47 GeV, which is taken from a lattice study of the glueball masses [292]. Treating g\u2032 and \u03c3v4 as free parameters. The result was g\u2032 = 0.292(12) and \u03c3v4a2 = 0.0015(3) with \u03c72min/Ndf = 5.1, and the corresponding curve is put in Fig. 25 (if mg is relaxed to be a free parameter, \u03c72min/Ndf is significantly reduced). The authors also computed the spectrum of heavy quarkonium [293] with the spin-dependent potentials up to order 1/mi (which does not yet include the hyperfine potential) and found good agreement with the bottonomium spectrum. The extension of the spin-dependent potentials to tetraquarks would be very interesting.\nAnother approach to address the spin dependence, is to study diquarks. Diquarks are important parts, not only of baryons, also of tetraquarks. Besides, they are also relevant for condensed quark matter. For the presently studied tetraquarks, we are mostly interested in groundstate diquarks, where the two quarks are in a relative s-wave. There are two types of such diquarks, with spin 1 and spin 0. In quark models, these diquarks are different due to the spin-spin, or hyperfine, interaction. While the hyperfine potential in quark-quark pairs has not been computed in lattice QCD, diquarks have been studied in different frameworks [294, 295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308, 309, 310, 311].\nOf the different studies, we highlight a recent study of diquarks on the lattice [310] in the background of a static quark, in a gauge-invariant formalism with quark masses down to almost physical m\u03c0. With more details than the previous studies, it determines mass differences between diquark channels as well as diquarkquark mass differences. The lightest and next-to-lightest diquarks have good scalar, 3\u0304F , 3\u0304c, JP = 0+, bad axial vector, 6F , 3\u0304c, JP = 1+, quantum numbers. The bad-good mass difference for ud flavours, 198(4) MeV, is in agreement with phenomenological determinations, see Fig. 26. As a very interesting observation, quarkquark attraction is found only in the good diquark channel, suggesting the hyperfine potential is stronger\nthan the Coulomb potential. A first exploration of the good diquark shape, shows it to be spherical, with a size of \u223c 0.6 fm .\nIn a third different approach, the quark-quark hyperfine splitting has also been included in tetraquarks, completing the potential study of Subsection 2.3, with an indirect method, in Ref. [66]. The potential study was performed using bilinear light quark-quark qq fields for the creation operators. To understand the details of the meson-meson structure generated by the creation operators, one has to express them in terms of static-light meson bilinears Q\u0304\u0393q.\nThe Tbb is then studied in an s-wave, with a 2 coupled channel equation of the BB\u2217 and B\u2217B\u2217 channels,[( mB\u2217 +mB 0\n0 2mB\u2217\n) \u2212 h\u0304\n2\u00b5\nd2\ndr2 12\u00d72 + ( Vj(r) + V5(r) Vj(r)\u2212 V5(r) Vj(r)\u2212 V5(r) Vj(r) + V5(r) )] \u03c7(r) = E\u03c7(r),\nwhere \u00b5 = mb/2 and the potentials, attractive V5 and repulsive Vj , computed in [63] are depicted in Fig. 26. The hyperfine splitting including a heavy quark is now present in the experimental mass difference of the B and B\u2217 mesons. If these masses were degenerate, we could diagonalize the potential, and one of the eigenvalues would be V5; in this case we would recover the result of Ref. [63] where the heavy quark spin effects were neglected.\nThe existence of the udb\u0304b\u0304 tetraquark, is confirmed with a binding energy with regards to the lowest channel BB\u2217 reduced to 59 \u00b1 38 MeV, but compared to the median between this channel and B\u2217B\u2217 the binding energy is essentially unchanged."

            "heading": "3.3. String and hybrid excitations with static quarks",
            "text": "The systems where a quark-antiquark meson is supplemented by the gluon, or flux tube, degrees of freedom are denominated hybrid hadrons. They have a very rich spectrum. Besides, a gluon has the same quantum numbers of a quark-antiquark pair in the 8 representation of SU(3), and in constituent gluon models, the gluon has an effective gluon mass of the order of two constituent quark masses. Thus exotic hybrids can be confused with tetraquarks who may have the same quantum numbers or masses. In this Subsection we address the lattice QCD flux tubes when the two heavy quarks are static.\nThe symmetry group of flux tubes is equivalent to the group of the molecular orbitals of homonuclear diatomic molecules. It is the point group denominated D\u221eh, which nomenclature was as well adopted in the lattice QCD studies of QCD flux tube excitations [276, 314, 315, 316, 317, 318, 319, 320, 321, 322, 323]. D\u221eh has three symmetry sub-groups, and they determine three quantum numbers.\nThe two-dimensional rotation about the charge axis corresponds to the quantum angular number, projected in the unit vector of the charge axis \u039b = |Jg \u00b7 e\u0302z|. The capital Greek letters \u03a3,\u03a0,\u2206,\u03a6,\u0393 . . . indicate as usually states with \u039b = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 . . . , respectively. The notation is reminiscent of the s, p, d \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 waves in\natomic physics. In the case of two-dimensional rotations there are only two projections Jg \u00b7 e\u0302z = \u00b1\u039b. They are degenerate in energy, and thus we skip this \u00b1 projection in the spectrum notation.\nThe permutation of the quark and the antiquark static charges is equivalent to the combined operations of charge conjugation and spatial inversion about the origin. Its eigenvalue is denoted \u03b7CP . States with \u03b7CP = 1(\u22121) are denoted by the subscripts g (u), short notation for gerade (ungerade).\nMoreover there is a third quantum number, due to the planar, and not three-dimensional, angular momentum. There is an additional label for the s-wave \u03a3 states only. \u03a3 states which are even (odd) under the reflection about a plane containing the molecular axis are denoted by a superscript + (\u2212).\nWith these quantum numbers, the energy levels of the flux tubes are labeled as \u03a3+g , \u03a3\u2212g , \u03a3+u , \u03a3\u2212u , \u03a0u, \u03a0g, \u2206g, \u2206u \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\nThe first lattice QCD simulations in the literature had only reported, for the \u03a3+g spectrum up to two levels by Juge et al [317, 318], and for the other spectra only the groundstate level had been reported in the literature [276, 314, 315, 316, 317, 318, 319]. Recently, several excitations, up to eight for the \u03a3+g , have been computed [323, 313].\nThe simplest Effective String Theory (EST), is the Nambu-Goto model, which action is the area of the transverse bosonic string surface in time and space, and is classically equivalent to the Polyakov action. Its spectrum for an open string with ends fixed at distance R with Dirichlet boundary conditions is given by the Arvis potential [324],\nVn(R) = \u03c3 \u221a\u221a\u221a\u221aR2 + 2\u03c0 \u03c3 ( \u221e\u2211 ai=1 nai \u2212 D \u2212 2 24 ) . (41)\nwhich has a tachyon in the groundstate. The lattice QCD groundstate is better reproduced by the large distance expansion of Eq. (41) , including a Coulomb term: the L\u00fcscher term [325] \u03c0R (\u2211\u221e ai=1 nai \u2212 D\u2212224 ) . ai are the principal transverse modes, and the continuum field theory computation of the zero mode energy is obtained using the Riemann Zeta regularisation [326, 327], which in lattice QCD is provided by the lattice regularisation.\nFig. 27 shows the many excited states of the first eight spectra recently computed in lattice QCD, where the dashed lines show the spectrum of the modified version of the Nambu-Goto ansatz. [313].\nAlso notice there is lattice QCD evidence for an intrinsic width of the QCD flux tube [150] superposed\nwith the quantum vibration width predicted by L\u00fcscher [328]. The QCD flux tube has a rich structure in chromoelectric and chromomagnetic field densities [321, 322]."

Heavy Ion collisions have shown to be able to produce loosely bound systems such as small nuclei or the Tcc. This is possible because, during hadronisation very large numbers of hadrons are produced, including nearly co-moving hadrons, who may from boundstates.\nHowever, for a strong boundstate we need at least an heavier b quark, but there are fewer b quarks produced at LHC than c quarks, not enough to have sufficient b close enough in phase space to form boundstates. Nevertheless, these predicted heavier tetraquarks, at least the Tbc are expected to be observable\nin the future with the High Luminosity Large Hadron collider (HL-LHC) at CERN [350], including detections expected in the future by the experimental collaborations LHCb and CMS.\nThe core of these tetraquarks, in the region where there is attraction, is of type diquark tetraquark, whereas the tail of their wavefunction is of the meson-meson type.

            "text": "Using heavy quark effective theory and dynamical light quarks, the predictions of a Tbb1+ and a Tbbs1+ boundstate are reliable, see Subsection 2.9. For the Tbb, in the earliest computations, there was some tension with binding energies from 83 MeV up to 189 MeV. However the last computations are now agreeing on a binding energy of the order of 110 to 150 MeV.\nHowever there is still some tension on other tetraquarks, since binding for the tetraquarks Tcc, Tccs, Tbb0\n+, Tbbc and Tbbcs is predicted in the computations of Ref. [57] only. Possibly, this group has not yet performed the large volume limit (thermodynamic limit), this might be revised in the future.\nIt is necessary to extrapolate to three different limits to have reliable results: the continuum limit of a fine mesh in the limit of lattice spacing a\u2192 0, the thermodynamic limit of a volume V \u2192\u221e, and the near chiral limit of m\u03c0 \u2192 140 MeV.\nIn lattice QCD, these limits are impossible to reach. Nevertheless, if one gets close enough, an extrapolation of these parameters in the correct direction is possible, and this is the approach used in lattice QCD, see for instance Figs. 19, 26.\n4.1.3. Future precision lattice QCD studies of diquark tetraquark boundsates The Tbb and Tbbs tetraquarks are already well established and we expect them to provide benchmarks for future lattice QCD computations, with a large engagement of the community to reduce the small tensions between the different approaches used.\nDetecting the Tbc will be a major goal of future experiments. In principle it should form a boundstate because it is more likely to bind than Tcc which was already found at LHCb. It is more likely to bind for two different reasons: the BD\u2217 \u2212 DB\u2217 system has a larger reduced mass, intermediate between the BB\u2217 and the DD\u2217, and moreover the heavy quarks can form a good singlet diquark.\nPresently, the Tbc has not yet been confirmed by lattice QCD since the error bar is larger than the binding energy. We expect the lattice community to invest in more precise simulations, to conclude on the binding/unbinding of Tbc.\nAll the different approaches can be improved, already with the presently available lattice QCD techniques, for instance spin dependence can be included in the static approach. Very recently, new approaches started to be used. In Ref. [351], machine learning was used to improve the spin terms in the non-relativistic effective heavy quark formalism for the b quark. We also expect new efforts from the community to compute more potentials for static quarks. Ref. [352] is using Laplacian eigenmodes to compute static potentials in the presence of dynamical quarks. In the case of shallow boundstates, large lattices may be necessary, this is detailed in Subsection 4.4.\n4.2. Full-heavy diquark tetraquarks: no boundstates, resonances will be difficult to study The full-heavy tetraquarks, with flavours ccc\u0304c\u0304 or bbb\u0304b\u0304 and any intermediate combination with c and b quarks or tetraquarks, can only be of the type diquark tetraquark because they cannot exchange light mesons in the t Mandelstam channel and the annihilation in the s Mandelstam channel is negligible.\nExperimentally, there is no evidence so far for boundstates of full heavy-tetraquarks. While states with a pair bb of heavy quarks (antiquarks) has not been accessible experimentally, systems with bb\u0304, cc\u0304, cc or ccc have been observed. In particular a pair of full-heavy tetraquark has been observed, as shown in Table 1. The lightest one is the X(6600) with flavour ccc\u0304c\u0304 which is of the order of 700 MeV above the lowest possible decay channel of a pair of \u03b7c mesons, it is a resonance, clearly not a boundstate. This suggests that indeed there is no full-heavy tetraquark boundstate, at least of the type ccc\u0304c\u0304.\nThe full heavy bbb\u0304b\u0304 tetraquarks have been studied by the lattice QCD group of Huges et al. [227]. Indeed no evidence was found for a boundstate. In Table 6, table II in Ref. [227], the authors present the quantum numbers studied: 0++, 1+\u2212 and 2++ and show that the meson-meson systems overlap with the diquark-antidiquark system.\nMoreover Junnarkar et al have studied several different types of tetraquarks, [57] at least double-heavy, and the closest to a full heavy boundstate they find is a ucb\u0304b\u0304. In principle, since they addressed the c quark as both one of the heaviest or lightest quarks, they could have studied different sorts of full-heavy tetraquarks. This suggests that they did not find boundstates with flavours ccc\u0304c\u0304 or ccb\u0304b\u0304.\nHaving no boundstate of this type is also suggested by the quark model. Let us focus on a diquark. Notice a bounstate should be in principle in a s-wave, with a symmetric spatial wavefunction. The colour of a qq pair should be in an anti-triplet which is antisymmetric. If we have two identical flavours, say cc or bb, the flavour is symmetric. The antisymmetry of fermion wavefunctions forces the spin to be symmetric, corresponding to a spin 1 system, and this increases the mass of our system. Moreover, after separating the centre of mass of each hadron, each meson has one Jacobi coordinate, and we count two Jacobi coordinates for a free meson-meson system. However a bound tetraquark would have three Jacobi coordinates. Due to the zero mode energy of each coordinate in a quantum system, this also increases the energy of the fullheavy tetraquark, and thus it is not expectable that the full heavy tetraquark binds, at least when all the for quarks have the same flavour. This is what Richard et al [16, 17, 18, 19] have been advocating since the eighties, pointing that the heavy-light tetraquarks are the preferred candidates for boundstates, although others [353] are able to bind full heavy tetraquarks.\nThus lattice QCD, in these full-heavy boundstate studies, agrees with the existing experimental observations and with some of the models: there is no evidence for full-heavy boundstate tetraquarks.\nThe difficult challenge is then to study the full heavy resonances in lattice QCD. The experimentally observed resonances are detailed in Table 1, there is the X(6900) observed at LHCb and CMS, and the X(6600) observed at CMS. Notice these are very excited resonances, 600 MeV to 1000 MeV above threshold. To reach their energy, Since a D meson is heavy, with a small gap between energy levels, many levels of energy in the meson-meson channels must be computed. They are observed in the J/\u03c8J/\u03c8 channel but are expected to couple as well to the \u03b7c\u03b7c and \u03c8\u2217\u03c8\u2217 channels. Thus there are too many meson-meson channels, with too many energy levels, to be simulable with the present lattice QCD techniques, which state of the art is referred in Subsection 3.4.\nNevertheless these tetraquark resonances are closer to the state of the art than tetraquarks even higher in the spectrum such as the ones of Subsection 4.5. We expect, in the future, this challenge will be addressed by the lattice QCD community.\n4.3. s pole tetraquarks: charmonium and bottonomium extra states are amenable to lattice QCD The s pole tetraquark type. may exist when a meson-meson system has a non-perturbative coupling to a single meson/quarkonium, with a string breaking/annihilation. This is presently amenable to lattice QCD simulations. The coupling needs to be strong enough to produce extra resonances, with dominant meson-meson content.\nIn the case of extra resonances with at least one charm quark, using the L\u00fcscher scattering technique with one D meson and another meson, lattice QCD was able to reproduce several resonances as detailed in Subsection 2.11, including the X(3872).\nIn the case of extra resonances with bottom quarks, using lattice QCD string breaking static potentials as in Subsection 2.5, and the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, it is possible to study resonances high in the bottonomium spectrum. In this case a pair of new s pole tetraquarks were identified, compatible with the \u03a5(10753).\nIt is interesting lattice QCD is able to address these resonances, but not yet the ones of Subsection 4.5. Nevertheless some developments are still necessary.\nThe effective range approach used in Subsection 2.11 is only approximate, and needs to be improved for very excited resonances. It has not yet been applied to bottonomium, say with the technique of Ref. [60].\nThe string breaking potentials used in Subsection 2.5 need improvement, with more precise data for potentials and mixing angles, with a clarification of the quantum numbers and with spin dependent terms as well."

            "text": "Lattice QCD shows some difficulty to find tetraquark boundstates close to the threshold, as we discussed in Subsection 2.10. Lattice QCD is able to study the spole type of tetraquark, but not the molecular or diquark. Such is the case of the Tcc, which is both similar to the Tbb and to the deuteron. The Tcc is a very challenging tetraquark. In the future new lattice QCD studies are expected to comprehend it.\nFor the first time, a very recent computation [58] studied the Tcc tetraquark with the L\u00fcscher phase shift, method as detailed in Table 3, computing the scattering of two D and D\u0304 mesons. However no resonance was found close to the thresholds, only a virtual pole was observed in the T matrix, as shown in Fig. 29. Notice the experimental pole is just of the order of 360 KeV below the D\u2217+D0 threshold but is a resonance above the D0D0 \u03c0+ channel. If the \u03c0+ mass used in the lattice computation is heavier than the physical one, what we would expect is a boundstate.\nThis indicates that there is still room for improvement in lattice QCD computations. Possibly the OPEP, described in Subsection 1.3.1 is important for the Tcc. Notice the OPEP is attractive in isoscalar systems, for instance in the famous case of the deuteron. The Tcc is an isoscalar as well, at least according to the lattice QCD computation of potentials for tetraquarks with two heavy antiquarks [61]. The OPEP needs not only a light pion, but also a large enough volume. Moreover, the Tcc [20, 21] is reported experimentally as a loosely bound state with a large size of the order of 7 fm. The range of the Yukawa potential is of the order of 1/m\u03c0, considering an average mass of 138 MeV we get a range of the order of 1.43 fm (actually the double of this since we should count the diameter and not the radius). Thus, in the case of loosely bound molecules, we would need a lattice with a size of a some fm to get all the binding provided by OPEP. Although lattice QCD with dynamical fermions is very expensive, (with small ensembles) is is now possible to use very large lattices. With the master-field approach, it is presently possible to use lattices of size 1924 [354, 355, 356, 357].\nIn Ref. [58], the lattice spacing is a = 0.08636(98)(40) fm, mu and md are degenerate and heavier than in nature, corresponding to m\u03c0=280(3) MeV, utilizing 255 configurations on spatial volume N3L = 24\n3 and 492 configurations on 323 [358] with periodic boundary conditions in space. This pion mass is twice as heavy as the physical one, possibly this decreases the binding produced by the OPEP. Moreover a size aNL of 2.1 to 2.8 fm would be insufficient to harvest the full binding power of the OPEP, had the pion the physical mass. On the other hand, the experimental LHCb Ref. [21] mentions that an excessive binding may lead to a virtual pole. Decreasing the mass of m\u03c0 closer to the physical one and further increasing the volume should move the pole closer to the experimental value. With state of the art techniques it is already possible to determine the precise path of the pole as a function of these parameters.\nMoreover the extension to the three-body scattering in the decay channel DD\u03c0 should be possible with the techniques of Hansen et al, [234, 235, 236, 359].\n4.5. New techniques needed for the diquark or molecular multiquark resonances high in the spectrum So far lattice QCD has tried with no success to reproduce tetraquark resonances of the types diquark or molecular high in the spectrum. The large efforts to reproduce the first observed tetraquarks, the Zb, Zc . . . family, high in the spectrum, and with many decay coupled channels, so far have failed. There is a recent positive result on the first observed pentaquarks of the Pc family, but it may need to be completed with a coupled channel study.\nThe first technique utilized was the one of Subsection 2.8, of studying the spectrum with different operators. It failed to find any evidence of the new tetraquarks. This possibly happens because the operator basis is over-complete, as discussed in Subsection 2.4.\nThen, using potentials approximating heavy quarks as static ones is a promising approximation, but in fully exotic systems we have not yet succeeded in identifying the mixing angle between the different channels.\nThe most rigorous approach to study resonances in lattice QCD is the L\u00fcscher phase shift method. However this technique, presented in Subsection 2.10, so far only can be applied to resonances with few open coupled channels of two mesons.\nIn a sense, lattice QCD is suffering from what led some of its successes. The groundstate energy is naturally obtained, as discussed in Subsection 1.4, in Eq. (8), even if we have a not so good operator. To use the L\u00fcscher technique high in the spectrum, we need to determine the spectrum of the different two meson or three meson states in a torus, and the corresponding eigenstates with a good precision. Eq. (8) can indeed be extended to a matrix equation where we can get several excited states.\nHowever, we still face two problems: the noise increases with the number of excited states since lattice QCD is a statistical approach, and moreover it is difficult to determine the wavefunctions of each state. The difficulty with a large number of coupled channels, lies in the disentanglement of these channels. We would need operators extremely close to the eigenfunctions, in order to clearly identify the energy levels.\nThis is different from the experimental observations. For instance, a Zc tetraquark resonance decays to many channels, but we can study the mass and width just from the lightest and more convenient energy channel, the J/\u03c8\u03c0, although the respective partial decay width is much smaller than the total decay width. This success has been possible because the decay products, say J/\u03c8 and \u03c0+ can be excellently tagged for\ninstance in muon detectors, J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u00b5+ + \u00b5\u2212 and \u03c0+ \u2192 \u00b5+ + \u03bd\u00b5. In lattice QCD we are still missing a successful tagging technique."

            "text": "As a brief conclusion, lattice QCD succeeded in predicting diquark tetraquark boundstates, and s pole resonances. It is expected that soon the shallow boundstates or very narrow states close to light thresholds will be successfully computed as well.\nThe robust results of lattice QCD can be used by models and effective theories of QCD, to calibrate their parameters. Moreover lattice QCD can address theoretical questions such as whether the diquark versus molecular operators are important for tetraquarks.\nSo far there are few lattice QCD results on pentaquarks, but the available techniques already applied to tetraquarks are expected to produce more pentaquark and hexaquark results in the future.\nMoreover, new avenues for tetraquark and pentaquark studies still need to be developed, to study the multiquark systems excited high in the spectrum. We expect the subtle tetraquarks and pentaquarks will become a priority for the lattice QCD community, with more computations, increased precision and new techniques to map this new world of hadronic physics."
