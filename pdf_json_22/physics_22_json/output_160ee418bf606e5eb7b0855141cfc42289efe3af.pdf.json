    "abstractText": "It has been proposed that band-inverted electron-hole bilayers support a phase transition from an insulating phase with spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry to a quantum spin Hall insulator phase as a function of increasing electron and hole densities. Here, we show that in the presence of proximity-induced superconductivity it is possible to realize Majorana zero modes in the time-reversal symmetry broken phase in the absence of magnetic field. We develop an effective low-energy theory for the system in the presence of time-reversal symmetry breaking order parameter to obtain analytically the Majorana zero modes and we find a good agreement between the numerical and analytical results in the limit of weakly broken time-reversal symmetry. We show that the Majorana zero modes can be detected in superconductor/time-reversal symmetry broken insulator/superconductor Josephson junctions through the measurement of a 4\u03c0 Josephson current. Finally, we demonstrate that the Majorana fusion-rule detection is feasible by utilizing the gate voltage dependence of the spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking order parameter.",

Here, we show that in the presence of proximity-induced superconductivity it is possible to realize Majorana zero modes in the time-reversal symmetry broken phase in the absence of magnetic field. We develop an effective low-energy theory for the system in the presence of time-reversal symmetry breaking order parameter to obtain analytically the Majorana zero modes and we find a good agreement between the numerical and analytical results in the limit of weakly broken time-reversal symmetry. We show that the Majorana zero modes can be detected in superconductor/time-reversal symmetry broken insulator/superconductor Josephson junctions through the measurement of a 4\u03c0 Josephson current. Finally, we demonstrate that the Majorana fusion-rule detection is feasible by utilizing the gate voltage dependence of the spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking order parameter.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nOne of the hallmarks of topological insulators is the spin-momentum locking of the surface states [1\u20138], which in the presence of induced superconductivity facilitates the realization of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) [9\u201311]. The special property of these quasiparticles, following from their identical creation and annihilation operators, is that they obey non-Abelian braiding statistics [12\u201314], which could be utilized in topological quantum computing [15, 16]. In one of the theoretically most elegant setups, the MZM appears at the interface between regions where the helical edge modes of a quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulator are gapped by the proximity effects from a superconductor and a ferromagnetic insulator, respectively [10\u201314]. From the theoretical perspective, the topologically robust single-mode propagation in each direction along the edge makes these systems ideal for the observation of transport signatures of MZMs, such as the zero-bias conductance peak due to resonant Andreev reflection [17, 18] and the 4\u03c0 Josephson effect [10, 19, 20].\nExperimentally, unambiguous observation of MZMs in QSH insulators is still missing even though signatures of edge mode superconductivity [21, 22], Andreev reflection [23] and 4\u03c0 Josephson effect [24] have been observed in these systems. One of the problems is that the creation of hybrid structures of QSH insulators and ferromagnetic insulators has been quite challenging despite of the recent progress in manufacturing hybrid nanowireferromagnetic insulator devices [25]. Moreover, although the gap can be opened also by applying sufficiently large external magnetic field instead of the utilization of the ferromagnetic insulator, this has detrimental effects on the quality of the superconductors, and therefore this approach is expected to lead to similar difficulties which have so far prevented the unambiguous observation of the\nMZMs in the nanowire devices.\nIn this paper, we demonstrate that neither the ferromagnetic insulator nor the external magnetic field is needed for the realization of the MZMs. Our approach is based on the previous theoretical work, where it was shown that band-inverted electron-hole bilayers support an unconventional topological phase transition from trivial to the QSH insulator phase via an intermediate insulating phase with spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry (TRS), arising from the excitonic correlations between the electrons and holes [26]. This exotic TRS broken phase is one of the most prominent candidates for the correlated phases appearing in bandinverted semiconductors due to Coulomb interactions [26\u201333], and it is consistent with the accumulating experimental evidence of excitonic phenomenology reported in InAs/GaSb quantum wells [34\u201338] as well as in WTe2 [39, 40]. Moreover, the properties of the TRS broken phase provide a comprehensive explanation [41] of the temperature, voltage and length dependencies of the observed conductance in InAs/GaSb bilayers [7, 42\u201344].\nWe show that MZM appears at the interface between the regions where the helical edge modes are gapped by the TRS breaking order parameter and proximityinduced superconductivity, respectively. Because the TRS is intrinsically broken in this system the MZMs can be realized in the absence of magnetic field and ferromagnetic insulators. We study the Josephson effect in superconductor/time-reversal symmetry broken insulator/superconductor junctions, and conclude, by checking that all the necessary conditions are satisfied [24, 45], that the MZMs in this system can be detected through the measurement of the 4\u03c0 Josephson effect. We compare various device geometries and vary the tunable parameters of the system to find the optimal conditions for the observation of the 4\u03c0 Josephson effect. Finally, building on the previous proposals for the manipulation of MZMs ar X iv :2\n20 5.\n13 34\n8v 1\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .m\nes -h\nal l]\n2 6\nM ay\n2 02\n2\n2 [46\u201349], we demonstrate that the Majorana fusion-rule detection is also feasible in this system by utilizing the gate voltage dependence of the spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking order parameter."

We have ignored the asymmetry of the masses and the momentum-dependent spin-orbit coupling terms, because they are not essential for understanding the phase diagram of the InAs/GaSb bilayers [26, 41]. The main effect of Coulomb interactions is the binding of the electrons and holes into excitons with the characteristic size d0 and binding energy E0 determined by the relation E0 = ~2/(md20) = e2/(4\u03c0 0d0). This leads to an excitonic mean field [26, 41]\nHEC = <[\u22061]\u03c4y\u03c3y + <[\u22062] [ kx\u03c4x\u03c3z \u2212 ky\u03c4y\u03c30 ] +=[\u22061]\u03c4x\u03c3y \u2212=[\u22062] [ kx\u03c4y\u03c3z + ky\u03c4x\u03c30 ] , (2)\nwhere the gap equations for the s-wave and p-wave excitonic correlations \u22061 and \u22062 are [41]\n\u22061 = gsd\n2 0\n(2\u03c0)2\n\u222b d2k [ \u3008c\u2020k\u21932ck\u21911\u3009 \u2212 \u3008c \u2020 k\u21912ck\u21931\u3009 ] \u22062 = gpd 4 0\n(2\u03c0)2\n\u222b d2k [ \u2212 \u3008c\u2020k\u21912ck\u21911\u3009(kx \u2212 iky)\n+\u3008c\u2020k\u21932ck\u21931\u3009(kx + iky) ] .

In our calculations the integration is performed over the range |k| \u2264 2.26/d0, but the exact values of the integration limits are not important.\nThe values of the model parameters for InAs/GaSb can be estimated by combining theoretical calculations [5, 26, 27, 50] and the experimentally observed energy gaps [7, 34]. This way, we arrive to parameter values [41]: E0/kB = 200 K, d0 = 10 nm, A/(E0d0) = 0.06, \u2206z/E0 = 0.02, gs/E0 = 1.0 and gp/E0 = 0.2. The gate-voltage dependent parameter EG is varied in our calculations to tune the system from trivial insulator to QSH insulator phase. For small (large) values of EG\nthe system is in a trivial (QSH) insulator phase, and these two phases are separated from each other by an insulating phase with spontaneously broken TRS, where =[\u22061],=[\u22062] 6= 0 [26, 41]. The bulk gap \u2206bulk remains open for all values of EG, because the intermediate TRS broken phase enables the connection of the topologically distinct phases without bulk gap closing. The edge gap \u2206edge decreases monotonously when one starts from the trivial phase and tunes the system across the TRS broken phase to the QSH phase, where the gapless edge excitations are protected by the topology [26, 41].\nHere, we consider the properties of the system in the presence of proximity-induced superconductivity in certain regions of the sample. The Bogoliubovde Gennes Hamiltonian in the Nambu basis \u03a8 = (ck\u2191, ck\u2193, c \u2020 \u2212k\u2193,\u2212c \u2020 \u2212k\u2191) can be written compactly as\nHBdG(k,x) = ( H(k,x) \u2206s(x) \u2206\u2217s(x) \u2212\u03c3yHT (\u2212k,x)\u03c3y ) , (4)\nwhere H(k,x) = H0(k,x) + HEC(k,x). The induced superconductivity has two effects in the regions proximitized by the superconductor. First, it leads to induced superconducting gap |\u2206s(x)| = \u22060 6= 0 in the regions of x covered by the superconductor. Secondly, it affects the parameters of the normal state Hamiltonian H(k,x). We assume that the superconductor completely screens the Coulomb interactions and renormalizes the band-inversion parameter, so that HEC(k,x) = 0 and EG(x) = E S G in the regions of x covered by superconductors. In the normal regions the spatially-dependent parameters have values |\u2206s(x)| = 0, EG(x) = ENG and HEC(k,x) is determined by Eqs. (2) and (3).\nWe start by investigating the edge excitations in the presence of induced superconductivity and time-reversal symmetry breaking order parameter. For this purpose we utilize a low-energy theory (valid at energies much smaller than the bulk gap |E| \u2206bulk)\nHe = \uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8edAeff(x)kx \u2212i\u2206ex(x) \u2206s(x) 0i\u2206ex(x) \u2212Aeff(x)kx 0 \u2206s(x)\u2206\u2217s(x) 0 \u2212Aeff(x)kx \u2212i\u2206ex(x) 0 \u2206\u2217s(x) i\u2206ex(x) Aeff(x)kx  , (5) where Aeff(x) is the velocity of the helical edge states, \u2206ex(x) is the time-reversal symmetry breaking order parameter in the normal regions of x, and \u2206s(x) = \u22060(x)e\ni\u03d5(x) is the induced superconducting pairing potential in the regions of x covered by the superconductors. If the TRS broken insulator (superconductor) covers the region x < 0 (x > 0) there is a MZM localized at x = 0 (see Fig. 1). Namely, there exist a zero-energy solution\n3 E\nk 2\u0394ex\nE\nk\nTRS broken insulator SC\n\u03b3=\u03b3\u2020. 2\u03940\nFIG. 1.

The corresponding field operator \u03b3 in the second quantized form obeys \u03b3 = \u03b3\u2020, and by choosing the normalization constant N properly we obtain \u03b32 = 1. Therefore, this solution satisfies the algebra of the MZMs.\nWe can also study the appearance of the MZM beyond the limits of validity of the effective edge theory using the full two-dimensional Hamiltonian (4). For this purpose we consider a sample with region \u2212Ly/2 \u2264 y \u2264 0 in the normal state and region 0 \u2264 y \u2264 Ly/2 covered by a superconductor [see Fig. 2(a)]. Such kind of system supports a Z2 topological invariant [19]\n\u03bd = sgn[PfM(0)PfM(\u03c0)], M(kx) = \u03c4y\u03c3yHBdG(kx), (7) where the Pfaffians of the antisymmetric matrices M(kx = 0, \u03c0) are real. The topologically nontrivial (trivial) gapped phases with \u03bd = \u22121 (\u03bd = 1) have odd (even) ground state parity and they do (do not) support unpaired MZMs at the end of the system, which for the geometry shown in Fig. 2(a) corresponds to the interface of the normal and superconducting regions along the edge. Additionally, the system can also support gapless phases.\nWe have numerically calculated the topological invariant \u03bd as a function of ESG and E N G using the algorithm developed in Ref. 51 [see Fig. 2(b)]. For small values of ENG the normal region is in a trivial insulator phase and the hybrid system is also in a topologically trivial\nxSC N\nTo po\nlo gi\nca l s\nup er\nco nd\nuc to\nr\nLy\n\u03bd=+1 \u03bd=-1\n(a)\n(b)\nFIG. 2.

(7), for a wide sample Ly d0 with upper half covered by the superconductor and lower half in the normal state. (b) Topological phase diagram as a function of ESG and E N G . In the dark blue trivial phase \u03bd = 1 and the hybrid system does not support MZMs. In the green topologically nontrivial phase \u03bd = \u22121 and the system supports MZMs at the interface of the TRS broken insulator and superconducting regions. The dashed lines indicate the values of ENG , where the normal half of the system has transitions from the TRS broken insulator phase to trivial insulator and QSH insulator phases. Here we have used Ly = 100d0 and \u22060 = 0.1E0.\nphase \u03bd = 1. Upon increasing ENG the normal region enters the TRS broken phase [dashed vertical line around ENG = 0.48E0 in Fig. 2(b)] but at this transition the hybrid system still remains trivial with \u03bd = 1. Only by further increasing ENG we find a separate phase transition of the hybrid system to a topologically nontrivial phase with \u03bd = \u22121, and this transition can be controlled with both ENG and E S G [see Fig. 2(b)]. If we increase E N G further the normal region finally enters into the QSH phase so that the hybrid system becomes gapless and the MZMs leak and delocalize into the QSH insulator region along the edge [see Fig. 2(b)]. We have checked with comprehensive numerical calculations that within the topologically nontrivial phase with \u03bd = \u22121 the system always supports MZMs at the interfaces of the TRS broken insulator and superconductor regions. These results are consistent with our effective edge theory, which is expected to the be valid on the QSH side of the TRS broken phase where the edge gap is smaller than the bulk gap, but the numerical approach allows us to establish the phase transition line also on the trivial side of the TRS broken phase.\n4 III. 4\u03c0 JOSEPHSON EFFECT\nW\n\u1d672\n\u1d674\nSC TR S br ok en\nin su\nla to r SC\n\u1d671\n\u1d673\n\u03940e-i\u03d5/2 \u03940ei\u03d5/2\nLS LN LS\nFIG. 3. Superconductor/TRS broken insulator/ superconductor Josephson junction for detection of the MZMs via the 4\u03c0 Josephson effect. The system supports two MZMs \u03b31 and \u03b32 (\u03b33 and \u03b34) on the bottom (top) edge with the corresponding low-energy local density of states indicated with the colors. The hybridization of the MZMs across a TRS broken regime of length LN gives rise to a 4\u03c0-periodic component in the Josephson current-phase characteristic I(\u03c6). The width is assumed to be large W d0 so that the parities P12 = i\u03b31\u03b32 and P34 = i\u03b33\u03b34 within each edge are conserved.\nWe now proceed to the consideration of the experimental signatures of the MZMs in superconductor/TRS broken insulator/superconductor Josephson junctions. We first consider the simplest geometry, where two large superconducting leads are connected by a wide W d0 normal region of length LN as shown in Fig. 3. Such a Josephson junction has a qualitatively different spectrum (see Fig. 4) depending on whether the hybrid system is in a \u03bd = 1, \u03bd = \u22121 or QSH part of the phase diagram shown in Fig. 2. In the trivial phase \u03bd = 1 there exists only gapped Andreev bound states [Fig. 4(a)], and therefore the application of a phase bias across the superconductors \u2206s(x) = \u22060 ( ei\u03c6/2\u03b8(x \u2212 Ln) + e\u2212i\u03c6/2\u03b8(\u2212x)\n) leads to a conventional 2\u03c0 periodic Josephson effect. In the topologically nontrivial \u03bd = \u22121 state, the system supports four MZMs \u03b3i (i = 1, ..., 4) at the interfaces of the TRS broken insulator and superconducting regions [see Fig. 3 and Fig. 4(b)]. Because W d0 the coupling between the Majoranas across the width of the sample can be neglected so that the parities P12 = i\u03b31\u03b32 and P34 = i\u03b33\u03b34 within each edge are good quantum numbers, and the application of the phase bias \u03c6 leads to a Josephson current, which in addition to the conventional 2\u03c0-periodic component also has parity-dependent 4\u03c0-periodic component [10, 19, 20]\nI(\u03c6) = I2\u03c0 sin(\u03c6) + I4\u03c0 P12 + P34\n2 sin(\u03c6/2) + h.h., (8)\nwhere h.h. denotes the higher harmonics.

In all our calculations the current is expressed in units of I0 = eE0/~ \u2248 4 \u00b5A. We concentrate only on the I2\u03c0 and I4\u03c0, which can be experimentally measured independently from the other harmonics in the Josephson radiation spectrum [24, 45]. In this type of experiments, the applied voltage V across the Josephson junction leads to ac Josephson effect \u03c6(t) = 2eV t/~, so that I4\u03c0 (I2\u03c0) results in Josephson radiation at frequency f4\u03c0 = eV/h (f2\u03c0 = 2eV/h). In addition to I4\u03c0 and I2\u03c0 also the energy gap \u2206gap between the MZMs and other Andreev levels is important for the robustness of the 4\u03c0 Josephson effect. In the presence of TRS breaking order parameter \u2206gap 6= 0, whereas in the QSH regime \u2206gap = 0 [cf. Fig. 4(b),(c)].\nSeveral conditions need to be satisfied so that the 4\u03c0 Josephson effect can be robustly detected. (i) It is important that the frequencies are much larger than the quasiparticle poisoning rate and the hybridization of the MZMs localized at the different edges f4\u03c0 1/Tpois,\u2206hyb/h. These do not pose fundamental problems, because the hybridization \u2206hyb can be made arbitrarily small by increasing the width of the sample W and the quasiparticle poisoning time Tpois can be as large as seconds in the state-of-the-art superconducting devices in the absence of magnetic field [53\u201355]. Nevertheless, in practice the experiment is expected to be less challenging if the Josephson radiation frequencies are reasonably large. Indeed, based on the earlier experiments [24, 45], we expect that the ideal operation regime for probing the 4\u03c0 Josephson effect is achieved by tuning the Josephson frequencies to the gigahertz frequency range with the applied voltage V . (ii) The energy gap \u2206gap between the MZMs and the other Andreev bound states should be sufficiently large to avoid Landau-Zener tunneling ~d\u03c6/dt = hf2\u03c0 \u2206gap and thermal excitations kBT \u2206gap. Violation of these conditions gives rise to 2\u03c0-periodic occupation of the Andreev levels which suppresses the 4\u03c0 Josephson effect, and the remaining signatures of 4\u03c0 Josephson effect depend on the details of the relaxation processes [20, 24, 56]. Thus, in the most robust operation conditions \u2206gap/h > 10 GHz. (iii) Finally, I4\u03c0 should be sufficiently large to overcome the detector sensitivity. Based on the earlier experiment [24, 45], we\n(b) >10 GHz\n>10 GHz\n>10 GHz\n>10 GHz\n>30 nA\n>30 nA\n>30 nA\n>30 nA\n(a)\n(c) (d)\nFIG. 5.

In all figures LS = 15d0 and W = 150d0. The optimal parameter regimes for the observation of the 4\u03c0 Josephson effect is the region between black and green lines. The upper bound of ENG (black line) is determined by the condition that \u2206gap is sufficiently large, whereas the lower bounds of ENG and E S G (green line) are determined by the condition that I4\u03c0 (shown in Fig. 6) is sufficiently large.\nestimate that I4\u03c0 > 30 nA would allow robust detection of the 4\u03c0 Josephson effect. Although I4\u03c0 and I2\u03c0 give separate peaks in the ideal detection, in practice very large I2\u03c0 can cause problems due to the broadening of the peaks in the case of imperfect detection of the radiation spectrum.\nAs discussed in the previous Section, the low-energy physics is quite well captured by the effective edge theory. Therefore, I4\u03c0 and \u2206gap can be accurately calculated analytically using Eq. (10) and the approach discussed in Appendix A in a large part of the parameter space ENG , ESG, \u22060 and LN (see Appendix B). On the other hand, we find that there exists a large number of Andreev levels which contribute to the I2\u03c0 because they have a significant dispersion as a function of \u03c6 (see Fig. 4). Therefore, we utilize the hybrid kernel polynomial method [52] implemented within Kwant software package [57] for calculation of the I2\u03c0 (see Appendix B). Our results for \u2206gap, I4\u03c0 and I2\u03c0 for various different model parameters are shown in Figs. 5, 6 and 7, respectively. We find that there exists a large region in parameter space where the conditions (ii) and (iii) for the robust detection 4\u03c0 Josephson effect are satisfied (see the optimal parameter regimes indicated in Figs. 5 and 6). However, we also notice that I2\u03c0 is typically an order of magnitude larger than I4\u03c0 (c.f. Figs. 6 and 7). This is not a problem in the case of an ideal detection because the 4\u03c0 and 2\u03c0 Josephson effects give rise to peaks at separate frequencies in the Josephson radiation spectrum.

We point out that if this becomes a problem it is possible to significantly reduce I2\u03c0 by changing the device geometry so that the superconducting leads are coupled only to one of the edges of the sample. Moreover, I2\u03c0 can be reduced also by decreasing the width of the sample W while still keeping it large enough so that coupling between MZMs located at the top and bottom edges remains sufficiently small (see Appendix B)."

            "heading": "IV. FUSION-RULE DETECTION",
            "text": "The fusion rules are a fundamental property of nonAbelian anyons describing how they coalesce. Equivalently with the nontrivial braiding statistics, also the nontrivial fusion rules require the existence of the topological ground state degeneracy, and they can be used to define the non-Abelian anyons, but they are much simpler to detect [49]. Namely, the previously considered setups can be easily generalized for the fusion-rule detection and validation of the topological qubit by introducing tunable Josephson energies EJ1 and EJ2 of two superconducting islands coupled to a superconducting ground (see Fig. 8), in analogy to the proposal suggested in Ref. [49] for the fusion-rule detection in nanowires. The superconducting islands contain a macroscopic number of electrons but they are sufficiently small so that the charging energies of the islands, EC1 and EC2, exceed temperature. The setup shown in Fig. 8 contains four MZMs, which we denote as \u03b3i (i = A,B,C,D), and they are spatially separated by distances LAB , LBC and LCD, respectively. The MZMs satisfy the algebra \u03b3i = \u03b3 \u2020 i and {\u03b3i, \u03b3j} = 2\u03b4ij , and they can be used to define a topological qubit. Assuming that the total parity is fixed (all operations need to performed faster than the quasiparticle poisoning time), the MZMs admit two ground states. For even total parity, we can write these two logical states of the topological qubit as\n|0AB , 0CD\u3009, |1AB , 1CD\u3009, (12)\nwhere NAB , NCD \u2208 {0, 1} refer to occupation numbers of ordinary fermions f\u2020AB = (\u03b3A + i\u03b3B)/2 and f \u2020 CD = (\u03b3C + i\u03b3D)/2. The measurement of the state in this basis can be performed by coupling (fusing) the MZMs \u03b3A and \u03b3B (or \u03b3C and \u03b3D) and then utilizing microwaves, charge sensor or charge pumping for read out of the fermion occupation number as described in detail in Refs. [47, 49]. The fusion rule of MZMs is\n\u03c3 \u00d7 \u03c3 = I + \u03c8, (13)\n7 which states that two MZMs can coalesce into identity I (occupation number of the fermion corresponding to the pair of MZMs is 0) or a fermion \u03c8 (occupation number is 1). The simplest manifestation of this fusion rule in our setup is to initialize the system into a state with well-defined occupation numbers of the fermions f\u2020AD = (\u03b3A+i\u03b3D)/2 and f \u2020 BC = (\u03b3B+i\u03b3C)/2, and to measure the occupation number NAB (or NCD). The probabilities for measuring occupation numbers 0 and 1 are then equal, because (see Appendix C)\n|0AD0BC\u3009 = 1\u221a 2\n( |0AB0CD\u3009+ |1AB1CD\u3009 ) ,\n|1AD1BC\u3009 = i\u221a 2\n( |1AB1CD\u3009 \u2212 |0AB0CD\u3009 ) . (14)\nHowever, some care is required to make sure that the\noutcome of the measurement can be interpreted as evidence of the Majorana fusion rules. We will describe the necessary protocol for the fusion-rule detection [49] and identify the optimal operation regime below. We point out that the detection of the braiding statistics and more complicated manipulations of the MZMs are also possible using our platform, but these operations would require a branched geometry [18, 46\u201349], which is much more challenging to realize experimentally. Thus, we do not consider these possibilities in this work.\nThe fusion-rule detection protocol outlined in Ref. [49] requires that the couplings between the MZMs can be varied as a function of time. In the limit EJk ECk (k = 1, 2), LAB , LCD ASeff/\u22060 and LBC ANeff/\u2206ex, the low-energy Hamiltonian for the MZMs is [18, 46\u201349]\nHeff = \u2212iUAB\u03b3A\u03b3B \u2212 iUBC\u03b3B\u03b3C \u2212 iUCD\u03b3C\u03b3D, (15)\nwhere (see Appendix A)\nUAB(CD) =  16 (2\u03c02)1/4 EC1(2) ( EJ1(2) EC1(2) )3/4 e\u2212 \u221a 8EJ1(2)/EC1(2) cos(\u03c0qk/e), charging \u2212 energy dominant \u22060\u2206ex\n\u22060+\u2206ex e\u2212\u22060LAB(CD)/A S eff , Majorana\u2212 overlap dominant\n(16)\nand\nUBC = \u22060\u2206ex\n\u22060 + \u2206ex e\u2212\u2206exLBC/A N eff cos(\u03c6/2). (17)\nHere the offset charge qk can be controlled with the help of a voltage applied to a nearby gate electrode, and we have assumed that Uij < \u2206gap, so that the excitations above the energy gap \u2206gap can be neglected. In the fusion-rule detection protocol [49], it is important that each coupling Uij (ij = AB,BC,CD) can be turned on Uij = Umax and off Uij = Umin, so that Umin Umax. In the case UAB(CD) we assume that LAB(CD) is sufficiently large so that we are always in the charging-energy dominant regime (see conditions below). Thus, these couplings are controlled with EJ1(2). Importantly, UAB(CD) depends exponentially on EJ1(2), so that a moderate tuning of the Josephson couplings leads to Umin Umax. We point out that it is only important to be in the regime EJ1(2) EC1(2) when the couplings are turned off Uij = Umin. When the couplings are turned on Uij = Umax the charging energy can even be larger than the Josephson coupling as long as Umax < \u2206gap is satisfied. If EJ1(2) EC1(2) one obtains Umax = EC1(2)/2 [47, 49]. Similarly, one also needs to tune UBC during the fusion protocol. Because of the exponential dependence on \u2206ex, the best way to turn UBC on and off is to control \u2206ex with the gate voltages. Also in this case it is important to be in the asymptotic limit (\u2206ex ANeff/LBC) when the coupling is turned off UBC = Umin, and it is only important that Umax < \u2206gap is satisfied when the coupling is turned on. In the description of the fusion\nrule detection protocol we set Umin \u2192 0. In practice it means that the time scale operations Top must satisfy Top ~/Umin. All the operations should be performed adiabatically with respect to the gap Top ~/\u2206gap and the turned-on coupling Top ~/Umax.\nThe fusion-rule detection protocol, which is based on the proposal in Ref. [49], is shown in Fig. 9. It consists of a two different sequences of operations called fusion experiment and control experiment. In the basis of logical states of the topological qubit (12) the low-energy Hamiltonian (15) can be written as\nHeff = \u2212(UAB + UCD)\u03c3z \u2212 UBC\u03c3x, (18)\nso that the eigenenergies and eigenstates of the Hamiltonian (18) are (we assume UBC > 0 for simplicity)\nE\u00b1 = \u00b1 \u221a (UAB + UCD)2 + U2BC , (19)\n\u03c8\u00b1 = 1\u221a 2 (\u221a 1\u2213 UAB + UCD|E\u00b1| ,\u2213 \u221a 1\u00b1 UAB + UCD|E\u00b1| )T .\n(20) In both sequences the system is first initialized to a unique ground state of the system |\u03c8GS\u3009, which is determined by the relative magnitudes of the turned-on couplings UAB , UBC and UCD, but the exact ground state is not important in the following. The fusion and control sequences applied to the ground state |\u03c8GS\u3009 look\n8 A B C D\nA B C D A B C D\nFusion experiment\nControl experiment\nA B C D A B C D\nA B C D A B C D\nFIG. 9. Protocol for detection of fusion rules. The solid (dashed) lines indicate couplings Uij between the MZMs \u03b3i and \u03b3j , which are turned on (off). In the final state the occupation numbers [NAB , NCD] are measured. In the fusion experiment the sequence of the operations lead to measurements of occupation numbers [0AB , 0CD] and [1AB , 1CD] with equal probabilities, reflecting the fusion of MZMs into I and \u03c8 channels. In the control experiment the sequence of operations always leads to fusion of MZMs into I channel so that the measured occupation numbers are always [0AB , 0CD].\nvery similar but they should lead to very different measurement outcomes of the occupation numbers NAB and NCD in the last step of the experiments, allowing to obtain strong evidence of the Majorana fusion rules.\nIn the fusion experiment one first turns off the couplings UAB and UCD, so that |\u03c8GS\u3009 evolves to a state |\u03c8F \u3009 = 1\u221a2 (|0AB , 0CD\u3009 + |1AB , 1CD\u3009). This corresponds to the initialization of the system into a state with welldefined occupation numbers of the fermions f\u2020AD and f \u2020 BC as discussed above [see Eq. (14)]. After this one can turn off the coupling UBC without changing the state of the system and finally measure the occupation numbers NAB and NCD. Thus, in the fusion experiment the occupation numbers [0AB , 0CD] and [1AB , 1CD] are measured with equal probabilities, reflecting the fusion of MZMs into I and \u03c8 channels [see Eq. (13)].\nIn the control experiment one first turns off the coupling UBC . This initializes the system into a state with well-defined occupation numbers of the fermions f\u2020AB and f\u2020CD, e.g. assuming that UAB , UCD > 0 we obtain |\u03c8C\u3009 = |0AB , 0CD\u3009. After this one can turn off the coupling UAB and UCD without changing the state of the system and finally measure the occupation numbers NAB and NCD. Thus, in the control experiment the occupation numbers [0AB , 0CD] are always measured, reflecting the fusion of MZMs into I channel.\nThe requirements for the fusion-rule detection mentioned above can be satisfied by choosing the charging energy to be EC1(2) \u223c 0.1 meV and tuning the Josephson energies in the range EJ1(2) \u2208 [0, 50EC1(2)]\nso that Umax \u223c 0.5Ec to Umin \u223c 10\u22127Ec. Taking A S(N) eff \u223c 0.1E0d0 and \u2206ex \u223c \u22060 \u223c 0.03E0, we find that the Majorana overlap across the superconducting island 1 (2) can be safely neglected if LAB(CD) & 1 \u00b5m. According to our calculations the gap \u2206ex opened due to TRS symmetry breaking can be tuned with gate voltages to be between [0.005E0, 0.03E0]. Thus, by choosing LBC \u223c 0.5 \u00b5m, we find Umax \u223c 10\u22123E0 and Umin \u223c 10\u22128E0. With these values of the parameters also Umax < \u2206gap, so that we can neglect the bulk excitations in our low-energy theory. At the same time kBT \u2206gap and kBT Umax, so that also the thermal excitations can be neglected. The operation time should satisfy Top ~/\u2206gap \u223c 10 ps and 100 ps \u223c ~/Umax Top ~/Umin \u223c 10 \u00b5s. These requirements can be satisfied in gate- and flux-controlled tuning of EJ1(2) [47, 49], as well as in gate-controlled tuning of \u2206ex. The operations should be performed much faster than the quasiparticle poisoning time, but since the external magnetic field is not required this does not pose additional constraints on the operation unless the poisoning time is significantly shorter than the observed and predicted Tpois in the state-of-the-art devices [53\u201355]."

We have shown that all the requirements for the observation of the 4\u03c0 Josephson effect can be satisfied in this system. By modifying the setup so that the charging energy of the superconducting islands exceeds the temperature, it is possible detect the Majorana fusion rules by utilizing tunable Josephson junctions and the gate-tunable energy gap opened by the the spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking order parameter. Our estimates of the relevant energy scales indicate that all the requirements for robust Majorana fusion-rule detection can be satisfied in this system."

(C2)\nIn the case of even total parity, the two possible states of the system are\n|0AB , 0CD\u3009, |1AB , 1CD\u3009 = f\u2020ABf\u2020CD|0AB , 0CD\u3009 (C3)\nsatisfying\nN\u0302AB |NABNCD\u3009 = NAB |NABNCD\u3009, N\u0302CD|NABNCD\u3009 = NCD|NABNCD\u3009. (C4)\nAlternatively, we can form the fermion operators, number operators and states as\nf\u2020AD = 1\n2 (\u03b3A + i\u03b3D), f\n\u2020 BC =\n1 2 (\u03b3B + i\u03b3C), (C5)\nN\u0302AD = f \u2020 ADfAD = 1\u2212 i\u03b3A\u03b3D 2 ,\nN\u0302BC = f \u2020 BCfBC = 1\u2212 i\u03b3B\u03b3C 2\n(C6)\nand\n|0AD, 0BC\u3009, |1AD, 1BC\u3009 = f\u2020ADf\u2020BC |0AD, 0BC\u3009. (C7)\nThe two sets of fermionic operators are related as\nf\u2020AD = 1\n2 (fAB + f\n\u2020 AB \u2212 fCD + f\u2020CD),\nf\u2020BC = i 2 (fAB \u2212 f\u2020AB + fCD + f\u2020CD). (C8)\nThus, by straightforward algebra we find that the basis states are related as\n|0AD0BC\u3009 = 1\u221a 2\n( |0AB0CD\u3009+ |1AB1CD\u3009 ) ,\n|1AD1BC\u3009 = i\u221a 2\n( |1AB1CD\u3009 \u2212 |0AB0CD\u3009 ) . (C9)\nThe important consequence of this simple algebra is that if one initializes the system into a state with well-defined fermion numbers NAD and NBC , and then measures the fermion number NAB (or NCD), the outcome will be 0 and 1 with equal probabilities. This is a manifestation of the fusion rule of the MZMs\n\u03c3 \u00d7 \u03c3 = I + \u03c8, (C10)\nwhich states that the MZMs can coalesce into identity I or a fermion \u03c8.\n[1] M. Z. Hasan and C.
