    "abstractText": "In this study, a memristor-based 2-DOF PI controller (2-DOF Mem-PI) was designed for the temperature profile tracking control of a heat flow experiment (HFE) setup. A simulation study is presented in which the performance of the designed controller is compared with a standard 2-DOF PI controller. Compared to 1-DOF control structures, 2-DOF controllers that include an extra adjustable parameter perform better in terms of response to disturbances and improving the transient response of the system. In addition, memristor-based controllers (Mem-PI and 2-DOF Mem-PI) and standard controllers (PI and 2-DOF PI) were compared and it was determined that because of the variable memristance value, the control structures containing memristors showed an adaptive feature. The simulation results demonstrated the success of the proposed controller in temperature profile reference tracking and showed the memristor to be applicable in nonlinear control structures.

A simulation study is presented in which the performance of the designed controller is compared with a standard 2-DOF PI controller. Compared to 1-DOF control structures, 2-DOF controllers that include an extra adjustable parameter perform better in terms of response to disturbances and improving the transient response of the system. In addition, memristor-based controllers (Mem-PI and 2-DOF Mem-PI) and standard controllers (PI and 2-DOF PI) were compared and it was determined that because of the variable memristance value, the control structures containing memristors showed an adaptive feature. The simulation results demonstrated the success of the proposed controller in temperature profile reference tracking and showed the memristor to be applicable in nonlinear control structures.\nINDEX TERMS 2-DOF PI controller, memristor, memristor-based controller, temperature profile control\nI. INTRODUCTION\nTemperature and temperature control are important factors in different classes and processes of industrial production that should be taken into consideration, especially in terms of the safety of the production facility and product quality [1]. In practice, tracking the reference temperature profile, keeping the temperature at a set point, and controlling the distribution of the atmospheric temperature are the most common temperature control tasks encountered. Temperature reference tracking control is also important, as it requires flexible, stable, and adaptable control because of various control theory issues such as the operating environment, varying time constants, and disturbing external factors that can be seen in real systems. Ahn et al. introduced a new analytical tuning method for the fractional-order integral derivative (FO-ID) I\u03b1D\u03b2 controller and applied it to analyze the heat flow in the obtained controller heat flow experiment (HFE) module. In addition, they presented comprehensive simulation results to demonstrate the practical and simple nature of the proposed new tuning rules [2]. Al-Saggaf et al. proposed a new modelbased analytical design for fractional-order controllers. The efficiency and performance of this proposed method was demonstrated by simulations and on a heat flow platform experimentally [3]. In another study, a control design\napproach for input saturated linear systems was presented. Two practical applications in both a heat flow system and a liquid flow system were presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control design method. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was demonstrated by experimental results [4]. Hernandez-Perez et al. investigated the stabilization problem of the class of highly unstable timedelayed systems. In the control structure they proposed, a new control law called the PIf controller, consisting of a standard PI controller and a first-order low-pass filter, was used. The performance of the proposed controller was tested in a thermal flow assembly equipped with a time delay and a recycling path, and it was reported that an adequate performance had been achieved [5]. In order to obtain a generally acceptable process response, Nath et al. proposed an automatic tuning scheme for the traditional internal model control - PID (IMCPID) controller by changing the single setting parameter depending on the latest process operating conditions [6]. They also demonstrated the superiority of the proposed fuzzy rulebased automatic adjustment scheme with the results of realtime experiments on level and temperature control processes.\nThe proportional-integral / proportional-integral-derivative (PI/PID) controller structure is a control mechanism that has a wide range of uses such as in electronic devices, mechanical\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

In addition, the advantages of the two-degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) control structure over the one-degree-of-freedom (1-DOF) control structure were stated by Horowitz [11]. The 2-DOF controller structure was developed for situations where a 1-DOF controller structure is insufficient. By adding the \u03b2 parameter to the controller structure, better performance is provided in terms of maintaining the response of the controller to disturbances and improving the transient response of the system. In recent years, there have been many studies based on different tuning and optimization algorithms proposed for 2-DOF control structures [12]-[16].\nThe memristor was first described by L.Chua in 1971 as a memory resistor and was produced by HP researchers in 2008 [17], [18]. The physically realized memristor quickly managed to attract the attention of researchers, but its application as a discrete circuit element has been delayed. However, researchers have realized many models and circuits by working on circuits that act as memristors [19]-[24]. Recently, testing of the memristor has begun in the control field, and memristor-based controllers have been suggested by researchers [25]-[32]. In applications such as variable gain and automatic gain control, the TiO2 memristor model was used as the memristor model due to the simplified expressions and the same ideal physical behavior [33]-[35]. In particular, once controllers designed using memristor emulator circuits increase and production has begun, their use will be possible in the future.\nIn previous studies, unlike this study, 1-dof PI controller with memristor-based integrator circuit was designed and applied to the heat flow system [28]. In [30], a PD control structure was obtained with a memristor derivative circuit and applied to the ball and beam system. In [31], a sliding mode control approach was obtained by using a memristor-based derivative circuit and simulation results for speed control of BLDC motor were presented.\nIn this study, a novel memristor-based 2-DOF PI controller structure was proposed. The simulation model of Quanser's heat flow experimental (HFE) setup was used to test the temperature profile tracking performance of the proposed controller and simulation results were presented."

The time delay for the heat flow system given in (15) was represented by e-Ls. where L is the time delay. One of the valid methods used to determine the effect of time delay on the relative stability of the feedback system is the Nyquist criterion. The Nyquist criterion remains valid for a timedelayed system, as the factor e-Ls, which adds a phase shift to the frequency response without changing the magnitude curve, does not introduce any additional poles or zeros in the contour. Also, a time delay e-Ls introduces an additional phase delay in the feedback system and makes the system less stable. In the stability analysis of such systems, most analytical tools are considered and the transfer functions of the systems are\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

The Pad\u00e9 approximation can be used to obtain a rational function approximation of the time delay. The Pad\u00e9 approximation uses a series expansion of the transcendental function e-Ls and matches as many coefficients as possible with a series expansion of a rational function of specified order. In practical applications of heat flow systems, time delay occurs. However, dead time and time delay are ignored in the model used in this study. In addition, stability analysis of the proposed controller was not performed.\nIn this study, 2-DOF PI controllers based on memristors were tested via HFE temperature profile tracking control and simulation results were presented. It was demonstrated that the memristor, known as the missing circuit element, can be applied in 2-DOF control structures. Results of this simulation study showed that the 2-DOF Mem-PI controller was successful in the temperature profile tracking control of the HFE. When Figure 9 was examined, it was observed that no overshoot occurred in all the compared controllers. Additionally, the 2-DOF control structures were faster in terms of reaching the reference compared to the 1-DOF control structures because of the extra adjustable parameter. As can be seen in Figure 9, 2-DOF control structures reached the reference approximately 1 second earlier than 1-DOF control structures. On the other hand, because they contained an extra parameter, the 2-DOF control structures were faster in eliminating error compared to the 1-DOF control structures. Figure 10 shows that the error elimination time of the 2-DOF PI controller is approximately 46% lower than the 1-DOF PI controller. Furthermore, the Mem-PI and 2-DOF Mem-PI controllers designed using a memristor were successful in eliminating error faster than the PI and 2-DOF PI standard controllers because of their variable memristance value. Depending on the voltage change of the error signal at the controller input, the resistance value of the memristor takes a value between the RON and ROFF values. Therefore, an adaptation effect occurs in the system.\nFuture studies are planned to demonstrate the effectiveness of this simulation study, to test the proposed controller structure on a real system with a dead-time included system model, and to analyze the stability, sensitivity and frequency stability of the system."
