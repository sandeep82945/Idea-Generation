    "abstractText": "29 Despite a global decrease in suicide rates in recent years, death by suicide has increased in the 30 United States. It is therefore imperative to identify the risk factors associated with suicide attempts 31 in order to combat this growing epidemic. In this study, we use an explainable-artificial intelligence 32 method, iterative Random Forest, to predict suicide attempts using data from the Million Veteran 33 Program. Our predictive model incorporates multiple environmental variables (e.g., elevation, light 34 wavelength absorbance, temperature, humidity, etc) at ZIP code-level geospatial resolution. We 35 additionally consider demographic variables from the American Community Survey as well as the 36 number of firearms and alcohol vendors per 10,000 people in order to assess the contributions of 37 proximal environment, access to means, and restraint decrease to suicide attempts.

We also 41 identified climatic features that were associated with suicide attempt risk by age group. 42 Additionally, we observed that firearms and alcohol vendors were associated with increased risk 43 for suicide attempts irrespective of the age group examined, but that their effects were small in 44 comparison to the top features. Taken together, our findings highlight the importance of social 45 determinants and environmental factors in understanding suicide risk among veterans. 46",

            "text": "NOTE: This preprint reports new research that has not been certified by peer review and should not be used to guide clinical practice.\nshow that geographic areas with higher concentrations of married males living with spouses are 39 predictive of lower rates of suicide attempts, whereas geographic areas where males are more 40 likely to live alone and to rent housing are predictive of higher rates of suicide attempts. We also 41 identified climatic features that were associated with suicide attempt risk by age group. 42 Additionally, we observed that firearms and alcohol vendors were associated with increased risk 43 for suicide attempts irrespective of the age group examined, but that their effects were small in 44 comparison to the top features. Taken together, our findings highlight the importance of social 45 determinants and environmental factors in understanding suicide risk among veterans. 46\nIntroduction 47 Suicide rates in the United States (U.S.) have been increasing in recent years despite these rates 48 declining globally1. According to the biopsychosocial model of suicide risks, there are distal, 49 developmental, and proximal factors that can affect the probability of suicide attempt2. Distal 50 factors are those related to familial and genetic predisposition and early-life adversity. 51 Developmental factors include personality traits associated with suicidal behavior, cognitive 52 deficits, and chronic substance misuse. Proximal, or precipitating factors include but are not 53 limited to psychiatric, psychological, socioeconomic, and environmental factors. Even though 54 socioeconomic and environmental factors are classified as proximal factors, they can 55 simultaneously influence distal and developmental factors such as early-life adversity and 56 individual development. Several studies have found associations between a number of 57 demographic factors and suicide such as age, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, marital status, 58 religion, etc.3. Furthermore, climatic variables such as cumulative solar radiation has been 59 negatively associated with suicide risk, while temperature and diurnal temperature range have 60 been positively associated with suicide risk4\u20136. However, to thoroughly analyze the effect of 61 environmental and socioeconomic factors on an individual-level risk of attempting suicide, a 62 comprehensive study at high geospatial and temporal resolution is needed to account for within-63 county variation7. 64 65 Other relevant proximal factors include access to means and substance misuse8,9. For example, 66 occupations with access to lethal means are associated with increased risk of death by suicide 67 and method of choice10,11. Moreover, controlling access to lethal means is an effective strategy 68 for decreasing suicide risk12. In the U.S., death by suicide is the leading cause of violent deaths, 69 and firearms are responsible for approximately half of these deaths13. Substance misuse also 70 plays an important role in suicide prevention because acute substance intoxication can increase 71 an individual\u2019s disinhibition. For example, a prior study showed that suicide decedents have an 72 increased risk of alcohol ingestion and intoxication before their death relative to controls14. 73 74 The objective of the present research was to conduct an analysis of climatic and socio-75 demographic features that are associated with increased risk for suicide attempts among U.S. 76 veterans using an explainable-artificial intelligence (X-AI) model. We were also interested in the 77 relationship of the number of firearms and alcohol vendors per 10,000 people as proxies for 78 access to means and decreased restraint, which were also included in the final model. Together, 79\nwe identify a number of novel factors at zip code-level resolution that impact individual-level risk 80 for attempting suicide. 81\nMethods 82"

All subjects provided informed consent and the research presented here 87 were approved by the VA Central Institutional Review Board. Cases were defined as having a 88 history of one or more suicide attempts (including both fatal and non-fatal), whereas controls were 89 defined has having no history of suicide attempts or ideation. This vector was created from 90 electronic health records (EHR) from the VA corporate data warehouse (CDW), using 91 International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnostic codes, survey data from the mental 92 health domain, and the Suicide Prevention Application Network (SPAN) data set16. We encoded 93 these data as a binary vector, where controls were represented by 0 and suicide attempts were 94 set to 1, regardless of whether the attempt was or was not fatal. In total, this resulted in 405,540 95 patients with 391,409 controls and 14,131 attempts. Each attempt and control were associated 96 with climatic and socio-demographic features according to the most recent patient ZIP code. Sex 97 distribution was 8% female and 92% male. This cohort was 73% white, 18% black or African 98 American, 1% American Indian or Alaska Native, 1% Asian, and 7% mixed race, missing, or 99 unknown. The mean age was 62.4 years for the whole cohort, 63.4 for males and 50.8 years for 100 females (Supplementary Figure 1A). Notably, this cohort was unbalanced in terms of cases and 101 controls where only 3% attempted suicide versus 97% who did not, which is reflective of the 102 occurrence of suicide attempts in the general population. Most of the suicide attempts in this 103 cohort were concentrated around 60 years of age, likely since this age group is overrepresented 104 among these patients (Supplementary Figure 1A and B). However, the proportion of attempts 105 grouped by age decreased steadily after age 60 (Supplementary Figure 1C). Due to this rapid 106 decrease in attempts after age 60, we explored the socio-demographic and climatic features that 107 were associated with suicide attempts in patients greater than 60 years of age separately from 108 those under 60 years of age. The split with patients above or equal to 60 contained a total of 109 267,447 individuals with 4,231 attempts and 263,216 controls. The split with patients below age 110 60 was composed of 138,093 individuals with 9,900 suicide attempts and 128,193 controls. 111\nClimatic Features 112 The climatic features included two groups: static measurements and monthly measurements. 113 Monthly measurements included longitudinal features such as monthly average precipitation and 114 maximum temperature. There were 12 distinct measurement types recorded each month, totaling 115 144 features. The 30 static features included features such as elevation and percent urban cover. 116\nThis led to a total of 174 climatic and weather-related features, mapped to 33,144 ZIP codes 117 across the U.S.17\u201323 (Supplementary Table 1). 118\nSocio-demographic Features 119 The socio-demographic features were collected from the 2019 American Community Survey, 120 produced by the United States Census Bureau24. These features included demographic, 121 socioeconomic, and housing features, such as the percentage of the population that were white 122 females between the age of 30 and 34 living in the ZIP code, percentage of rented housing units 123 in the ZIP code that have adequate plumbing facilities, and the Gini Index of Income Inequality. 124 These 1606 features were captured using the tidycensus software package in R using 5 years 125 estimate for 201925. These features were normalized to represent a percentage of the total 126 population or age bracket within each ZIP code. We also included two additional features: 127 population density (people per square mile) and the ratio of water to land area, which led to a total 128 of 1608 demographic features that were mapped to 33,120 ZIP codes across the U.S 129 (Supplementary Table 2). 130\nAlcohol and Firearms Features 131 The Historical Business Database26 contains information on the businesses that exist in every ZIP 132 code in the U.S. We utilized two important features from this dataset: one that measured the 133 number of firearms vendors per 10,000 residents in each ZIP code, averaged across the years 134 2010 and 2019, and the similarly calculated number of alcohol vendors. This information was 135 included for 31,378 ZIP codes across the U.S (Supplementary Table 3). 136\nExplainable-AI Analysis 137 In this study, we used iterative Random Forest (iRF)27,28, an X-AI algorithm that ranks input 138 features by importance through iterative feature weighting, to associate proximal environmental 139 features with suicide attempts. Thus, data pre-processing was necessary to ensure accuracy and 140 objectivity in the results by reducing the number of highly correlated, redundant features 141 explaining variance in the model. Large pairwise correlations between input features may 142 negatively impact the iRF model, since the importance of one feature is then split across the 143 correlated features, thereby decreasing their overall importance in predicting suicide attempt. To 144 account for this, if one feature was highly correlated with another, one of the features was selected 145 to be a representative of both features, while the other feature was removed from consideration. 146 Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients were calculated between all 1,784 features. Pairs of features 147 with a correlation coefficient greater than or equal to 0.90 in absolute value were considered to 148 be highly correlated. This analysis found 390 features that were highly correlated with each other. 149 Of these 390 features, 142 of them were kept as representative features (Supplementary Table 150 4). Thus, 248 features were dropped, reducing the total number of features to 1,536. 151\niRF k-Fold Cross Validation and Accuracy Calculation 152 To obtain accuracy scores for the iRF model, k-fold cross validation was used. For this study, 5-153 fold cross validation was repeated ten times, for a total of 50 computational runs. For each run, 154 the data was separated into an 80/20 training/testing split, where 80% of the data was used for 155 training the model and the remaining 20% was reserved for testing. To prevent geographical bias, 156 patients within the same ZIP code were moved to either the training or testing dataset. Prediction 157 accuracy was calculated using the average Area Under the Precision Recall curve (AUPRC), 158 where precision was defined as true positives / true positives + false positives and recall as true 159 positives / true positives + false negatives. Each random forest in the iRF model includes 1000 160 trees with a leaf node size of 1000 patients. We set the number of iRF iterations to five to rank 161 the importance of each feature in predicting suicide attempt. In addition to ranking input features 162 by importance, we next identified the feature-level explainability of our model by determining 163 whether each feature was predictive for or against suicide attempt. To estimate if a feature 164 predicts suicide attempt or controls, the result of each split was averaged using the given feature 165 and mapping those to a linear effect. This provided both the feature effect in the slope of the line 166 and an R2 with how closely that related to each of the set of splits. If the slope of the line was 167 positive, then the feature effect size direction was positive, i.e., the value and the feature were 168 positively correlated. If the slope of the line was negative, then the feature effect size direction 169 was negative. 170\nModel selection 171 Initially we ran iRF models with k-fold cross validation using all 1,536 features to capture the most 172 important features predicting suicide attempt in patients above or equal 60 years and below 60 173 years of age. Then, we used several combinations of the most important features together with 174 alcohol and firearm vendors per 10,000 residents to run reduced iRF models with k-fold cross 175 validation to evaluate if this improved the accuracy of the models. The accuracy of the reduced 176 models was better than using all features in all cases as shown in the area under the precision 177 recall curves (AUPRC) for all 50 data splits used to test the models (Supplementary Figure 2 178 and 3). These results show that by using all features we may introduce noise that may reduce 179 accuracy and explainability of the model. Interestingly, most of the models had some degree of 180 predictability, since most of them had AUPRC above random chance, and this effect was stronger 181 in the age group of patients below 60 years of age (red dashed line in Supplementary Figure 2). 182 Based on these results, we selected the model including the top 20 features plus firearms and 183 alcohol vendors for model explanation. 184\niRF-LOOP 185 To show how features or groups of features interconnect each other, we applied iRF-Leave One 186 Out Prediction (iRF-LOOP), which is an extension of the iRF model27. In this framework, iRF was 187 used to compute all-against-all predictions of each vector of data from all other vectors. The 188 results of this analysis were captured as networks, in which nodes (i.e., features) were connected 189 by an edge if the pair of features were predictive of each other, thereby revealing functional 190\nrelationships and subgroups within and across data layers. We performed iRF-LOOP using the 191 pre-processed input matrix which consisted of climate, census, and alcohol and firearm business 192 data, with a total of 1,536 features and 31,378 samples or ZIP codes. This analysis created an 193 all-to-all directed feature association network that captured the relationships between data layers. 194 The resulting network was then thresholded to the top 1% of edges to capture the most important 195 connections between features. 196\nResults 197\nFeatures that were most strongly associated with suicide attempts 198 iRF predictive models can compute the importance of each feature predicting the dependent 199 variable as well as the direction of the prediction, which in this case was predicting suicide attempt 200 vs control. We examined iRF models trained with 1,536 features to identify the 20 most important 201 predictive features in patients below, and above or equal to age 60, plus firearms and alcohol 202 vendors per 10,000 residents (Supplementary Figure 4 and 5). The resulting features were 203 further analyzed to determine directionality (i.e., if they predict suicide attempts or controls) and 204 can be aggregated in groups related to emotional support, housing, ancestry, commuting and 205 mobility, access to healthcare, cognitive difficulties, access to means, decrease restraint and 206 climate (Figure 1 and 2). 207 208 In the model using patients of above or equal 60 years of age, the features married males and 209 household with spouse present between 35 - 64, and 65 years of age and above were associated 210 with decreased risk for attempting suicide, whereas males never married of 75 - 84 years, and 211 married males of 85 years of with spouse absent were associated with increased risk for 212 attempting suicide (Figure 1). Ancestry also appeared among the top features explaining suicide 213 attempts. French Canadian, Northern European, and Pennsylvania German ancestries were 214 associated with increased risk for suicide attempts, whereas Dutch ancestry and speaking French 215 (Haitian or Cajun dialects) at home were associated with reduced risk (Figure 1). Females with a 216 work commute lasting 10 to 14 minutes, and number of firearms and alcohol vendors per 10,000 217 residents were also associated with increased risk (Figure 2). Several climate features were also 218 predictive: precipitation in April, solar radiation in July (which represents solar radiation in June, 219 through September), and wind speed in July (which represents wind speed in May through 220 September) were associated with decreased risk, whereas wind speed in April (which represents 221 wind speed for the rest of the year) and maximum temperature in December (which represents 222 average temperature from October through April, minimum temperature from November through 223 March, and maximum temperature from October through March) were associated with increased 224 risk (Figure 2). For representative relationships among variables (Pearson > 0.9) see 225 Supplementary Table 4. 226 227 For the model using only individuals under 60 years of age, the two most important features 228 associated with decreased risk were married males, and females with no cognitive difficulties 229 between 35 and 64 years of age (which represents a lack of disabilities, including no hearing, 230 vision, ambulatory, or self-care difficulties in females 35-64 years of age) (Figure 1 and 2). 231\nConversely, the features living alone and living with unmarried partner were associated with 232 increased risk (Figure 1). Similarly, commuting between 10 to 14 mins, regardless of gender, 233 monthly housing costs between $700-800, cash rent between $600-649, house heating using 234 gas, moved within county, and having two types of public insurance were all associated with 235 increased risk (Figure 1 and 2). On the other hand, only Pennsylvania German ancestry was 236 associated with increased risk in the ancestry category (Figure 1). Similarly to the model from 237 patients 60 years of age or above, number of firearm and alcohol vendors per 10,000 inhabitants 238 were associated with increased risk (Figure 2). Regarding climatic features, precipitation in 239 January (which represents precipitation December through February) and water vapor in May 240 (which represents water vapor from April through October and minimum temperature in May) 241 were associated with reduced risk (Figure 2). Contrary to the first model, in patients under 60 242 years of age the climatic variables solar radiation in July (which represents solar radiation in June 243 through September), and both wind speed in July (which represents wind speed in May through 244 September) and wind speed in April (which represents wind speed during the rest of the year) 245 were predictive of individuals with a history of suicide attempt (Figures 1 and 2). Additionally, 246 terrain elevation were also associated with suicide attempts (Figure 2). 247\nFeature network by iRF-LOOP 248 It is well known that alcohol abuse increases suicide risk2. Thus, we included the number of 249 alcohol vendors per 10,000 people in our final model. Interestingly, when used in combination 250 with the top 20 features, alcohol vendors per 10,000 people ranked 12th and 20th in feature 251 importance in patients above or equal to 60 and below 60 years of age respectively, even though 252 it ranked 360th (above age of 60) and 74th (below age of 60) in the models using all features 253 (Supplementary Figure 4 and 5). This could mean that other features are competing with 254 number of alcohol vendors per 10,000 people within the iRF model to classify suicide attempt and 255 controls. Therefore, we created a feature network using iRF-LOOP to explore how features relate 256 to each other. Figure 3 shows the immediate neighbors of the feature measuring the number of 257 alcohol vendors per 10,000 people, where each node in the subnetwork represents a feature and 258 the arrows represent the edges (connections) between features. Edges are weighted by their 259 normalized feature importance value and the arrow direction shows what feature is predicting 260 another one. Several features related to geographic mobility, population density, low gross rent 261 with cash, and high home value were observed. Further, the subnetwork shows associations 262 among features including number of widowed females, several European ancestries, and the 263 population-adjusted density of alcohol vendors. Regarding climate features, minimum 264 temperature in July and maximum temperature in December were observed. 265\nDiscussion 266 Most prior suicide prevention studies have focused on a relatively small number of features. 267 Moreover, most have typically relied on individual-level information only (e.g., clinical features) or 268 aggregated data for a given geographical area with low geospatial resolution. In the present study 269 we showed that ZIP code-level data can improve prediction in individuals with a history of suicide 270 attempt greater than random chance, supporting the role of the surrounding environment as 271\nproximal/precipitating factors that influence the propensity for an individual to attempt suicide. 272 Furthermore, using X-AI we were able to screen more than a one thousand seven hundred 273 demographic and climatic features to obtain several that appear to potentially protect or increase 274 veterans\u2019 propensity for attempting suicide. 275 276 An individual\u2019s environment can have profound effects on their psychological state and 277 subsequent risk of suicide. In fact, it has been well documented that socioeconomic and 278 demographic factors such as poverty, education and population density are related to suicide 279 risk29\u201331. In our study we used the EHR data from VA CDW, ACS and climate data to build a 280 predictive model of suicide attempts in the U.S. veteran population. It is worth highlighting that 281 ACS and climate data are not direct information from the individuals under study, but rather a 282 representation of the environment in which they currently reside. Moreover, in the cohort used 283 here, there was a rapid decline in the number of suicide attempts after the age of 60 284 (Supplementary Figure 1), which is in agreement with a surveillance summary from the Center 285 for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), where the highest suicide rates were observed in age 286 group between 35 and 64 years32. Thus, we divided the population into cohorts below or equal 287 to/above 60 years of age for further analysis, since age groups may be affected differently by risk 288 factors33. 289 290 Interestingly, the top features can be classified into nine main groups namely: emotional support, 291 housing, ancestry, commuting and mobility, climate, decreased restraint, access to means, 292 cognitive difficulties and access to healthcare (Figure 1 and 2). In the emotional support group, 293 the protective effect of marital status on suicide risk is well-documented34. Studies have shown 294 that married people showed the lowest rate of suicide rates34\u201336, whereas divorced or separated 295 persons are twice as likely to commit suicide than married persons, and this effect is stronger in 296 divorced males37. In our study, for all age groups we observed that living in areas with high 297 proportions of married males and individuals living with a spouse were protective factors against 298 suicide attempts for those 60 years of age or above (similar to the individual-level protective factor 299 of marital status). Conversely, areas with high proportions of individuals living alone and 300 unmarried males were associated with higher rates of suicide attempts38. 301 302 Regarding the commuting and mobility group, commuting time has been associated with 303 depression in a dose responsive manner39. Our results showed that living in areas with high 304 proportions of individuals with commutes between 10 and 14 minutes has been associated with 305 increased risk for suicide attempts, irrespective of age. The iRF-LOOP network showed that 306 commuting features are predictive of each other regardless of the commuting time 307 (Supplementary figure 6). Thus, commuting between 10 and 14 minutes may be acting as a 308 proxy for commuting in general. We also observed housing-related features for both age groups 309 in relation to suicide attempts. These results are consistent with Lorant et al. (2005)40, who 310 showed that higher education and home ownership status decreases the risk of suicide. Other 311 studies have found that living in rented units increased the risk for suicide in middle-aged males 312 and females31. This effect might be especially important for females who live in large urban 313 areas41. 314 315\nIn the ancestry group, we observed that living in areas with a higher proportion of Northern 316 European ancestry was associated with suicide attempts. Although suicide attempts vary widely 317 in Europe, countries of Finno-Ugrian origin show disproportionally higher suicide rates than the 318 rest of Europe, suggesting a genetic cause42. Voracek (2006)43, tested this hypothesis in the 319 U.S.A. using state-level self-reported ancestry from census data. The study found support for this 320 hypothesis using historical data from 1913-1924 and 1928-1932, but not from 1990-1994. Taken 321 together, these findings encourage an analysis with higher geospatial resolution of the sample 322 (e.g. ZIP or county level) and a genetic characterization of the individuals ancestries, since self-323 reporting may be inaccurate. We also found that living in a ZIP code with higher proportion of 324 Native Hawaiian and other pacific islander females between ages 45 to 54 was associated with 325 suicide attempts. These results are consistent with Ji and colleagues (2020)44 finding, who 326 showed that Asian or Pacific Islander ancestry was a risk factor for suicide in healthcare 327 professionals. 328 329 Seasonality of suicide attempts is also a well-known phenomenon, and climate has been 330 suggested to potentially be the main cause of this pattern45. However, results have varied 331 depending on the methods and location used46,47. Several studies have shown that solar 332 radiation, precipitation, and temperature are associated with suicide risk4\u20136. In our results we 333 observed that precipitation in April, solar radiation in July (which represents solar radiation in 334 June, through September) and wind speed in July (which represents wind speed in May through 335 September) were protective, whereas wind speed in April (which represents wind speed for the 336 rest of the year) and maximum temperature (with lower temperatures) in December (which 337 represents average temperature from October through April, minimum temperature from 338 November through March, and maximum temperature from October through March) were 339 associated with increased risk among patients 60 years of age or above. In patients under 60 340 years of age, precipitation in January (which represents precipitation December through 341 February) and water vapor in May (which represents water vapor from April through October and 342 minimum temperature in May) were protective, whereas solar radiation in July (which represents 343 solar radiation in June through September), and wind speed throughout the year were associated 344 with increased risk. Furthermore, while climatic variation exists even within zip code-level 345 resolution, climatic features exhibit the closest overlap between individual-level and zip code-level 346 features. 347 348 Another goal of the present work was to explore decreased restraint and access to means for 349 suicide attempts using the number of alcohol and firearms vendors per 10,000 residents as 350 proxies. Importantly, regardless of age, we observed that living in areas with more alcohol and 351 firearm vendors was associated with increased risk for attempting suicide (albeit less so than 352 several of the climatic and socio-demographic features identified as important). These results 353 provide additional evidence regarding the importance of access to means as one of several risk 354 factors for suicide, especially in the U.S., where a larger proportion of suicides are committed 355 using firearms in comparison to other high income countries where only 5% use them13,48,49. Our 356 findings also confirm the importance of including alcohol abuse in models of suicide risk50,51. 357 358\nStudy Limitations and Future Directions 359\n360 The present study had a number of limitations that should be considered when interpreting these 361 findings. First, we utilized a cross-sectional design, and a lifetime suicide attempts variable. Thus, 362 additional work is still needed to examine the degree to which the features identified in the present 363 study might be predictive of future suicide attempts. Second, our findings regarding alcohol and 364 firearms vendors should be interpreted cautiously, as there are several other variables 365 (Supplementary figure 7) that could also potentially explain their association with suicide 366 attempts which should be considered in future work. Third, while the present study provides clear 367 evidence that zip code-level geospatial variables can predict suicide attempt risk better than 368 random chance, the degree to which these variables might predict suicide attempts above and 369 beyond well-validated individual-level risk factors (e.g., psychiatric diagnosis) remains unknown. 370 While such work is beyond the scope of the present study, future work is still needed to ascertain 371 if and how geospatial variables might interact with individual-level data to predict suicide risk. 372\nConclusion 373 In this study we demonstrated the use of X-AI to explore the impact of more than 1,700 374 demographic and climatic features on suicide attempt risk with high geospatial resolution. This 375 research provides additional evidence for the role of several demographic and climatic features 376 in suicide attempts and demonstrates the utility of using geospatial features within an X-AI 377 framework to improve suicide risk prediction. 378\nAcknowledgements 379 This research is based on data from the Million Veteran Program, Office of Research and 380 Development (ORD), Veterans Health Administration (VHA), and was supported by award 381 #I01CX001729 from the Clinical Science Research and Development (CSR&D) Service of VHA 382 ORD.
