    "abstractText": "This paper presents two applications of the general principle \u2013 the everything is a matter of degree \u2013 the principle that underlies fuzzy techniques. The first \u2013 qualitative \u2013 application helps explain the fact that while most earthquakes occur close to faults (borders between tectonic plates or terranes), earthquakes have also been observed in areas which are far away from the known faults. The second \u2013 more quantitative \u2013 application is to the problem of which of the collaborators should be listed as authors and which should be simply thanked in the paper. We argue that the best answer to this question is to explicitly state the degree of authorship \u2013 in contrast to the usual yes-no approach. We also show how to take into account that this degree can be estimated only with some uncertainty \u2013 i.e., that we need to deal with interval-valued degrees.

            "text": "Importance of earthquake studies. Earthquakes are among the most devastating events. Their effect depends on our preparedness. If we know that a certain area is prone to have earthquakes of certain magnitude, then we can strengthen all the buildings and structures, so as the minimize the earthquake\u2019s damaging effect. This strengthening is reasonably expensive, so it is only used when we are reasonably confident that earthquakes of such magnitude are possible.\nBecause of this, predicting the magnitudes and location of possible future earthquakes is one of the main objectives of geosciences.\nSeismogenic zones: traditional approach to earthquake study. Up to the 19th century, scientists believed that continents remain the same. Then it turned out that continents \u2013 or, to be more precise, plates containing continents or parts of the continents \u2013 drift with time. This knowledge formed what is now called plate tectonics. It was noticed that most strong earthquakes \u2013 as well as most volcanos \u2013 occur in the borders between these plates.\nLater on, it was found that plates themselves are not unchangeable \u2013 they consist of smaller pieces called terranes that can also drift with respect to each other. The vast majority of earthquakes occurs close to the faults \u2013 boundaries of terranes.\nThis is still the main approach to predicting earthquakes: researchers usually assume that the earthquakes occur only at the faults. So at the faults, they recommend engineering measures to mitigate the effect of possible earthquakes, while in the areas inside the terranes no such measures are recommended.\nRecent discovery. A recent statistical analysis of earthquake records has shown that, contrary to the above-described traditional beliefs, earthquakes are not limited to the faults; see, e.g., [2]. Most earthquakes do occur at the faults, but there have been earthquakes in other areas as well: as we move away from the fault, the probability of an earthquake decreases but it never goes to 0.\nWhat does this mean in terms of seismogenic zones? In the traditional approach, there was a clear (crisp) distinction between seismogenic zones where earthquakes are possible and other areas where earthquakes are not possible.\nThe recent discovery shows that earthquakes are possible literally everywhere. At first glance, this implies that the whole Earth is a seismogenic zone, but this\nwould be a useless conclusion. There should be a difference between zones where earthquakes are frequent \u2013 e.g., near the major faults \u2013 and zones where earthquakes are so rare that it took several decades to notice them. In other words, some areas are clearly seismogenic zones, while other are barely seismogenic.\nIn other words, being a seismogenic zone is not a crisp property, it is a matter of degree: some areas are more seismogenic, some are less seismogenic. This is perfectly in line with the main idea that Zadeh placed in the foundation of fuzzy logic (see, e.g., [1, 4, 9, 11, 12, 15]) \u2013 that everything is a matter or degree.\nWhat is the physical meaning of this phenomenon. The traditional approach implicitly assumes that a fault is a line. In such a description, we can easily separate regions close to the line from regions which are far away from the line. A similar description was thought to hold when we describe visible cracks: e.g., cracks in rocks, cracks in pavement, etc. A more detailed analysis has shown that visible cracks actually have a fractal structure (see, e.g., [7, 14]):\n\u2022 there is a main crack line, along which the stress is high, \u2022 at several points in the main line, it branches into then smaller-size crack lines,\nalong which the stress is somewhat smaller; \u2022 at several points in each of these \u201csecond-order\u201d lines, the line itself branches\ninto even smaller-size crack lines, with even smaller stress, etc.\nBecause of this structure, there is, in effect, no area completely without cracks and without stress:\n\u2022 there are areas around the main fault line, in which the crack is the most visible and the stress is the highest; \u2022 there are areas around the second-order fault lines, where the crack is less visible and the stress is somewhat lower; \u2022 there are areas around the \u201cthird-order\u201d fault lines, where the crack is even less visible and the stress is even lower, etc., \u2022 all the way to areas where cracks are microscopic and the stress is barely measurable.\nThis is what we directly observe in rock cracks, in the pavement cracks, and this is what we indirectly observe for earthquakes: earthquakes can appear everywhere, just in some areas they are more frequent and stronger, while in other areas they are less frequent and weaker. This means, in effect, that faults are everywhere, just in some areas they are larger and correspond to larger stress, while in other areas, they are weaker and the corresponding stress is smaller.\nIn other words, for this phenomenon, physics is in perfect agreement with Zadeh\u2019s principle \u2013 at least on the qualitative level."

            "heading": "3 Possible Application to Authorship",
            "text": "Formulation of the problem. In the past, most researchers worked on their own, and most papers had just one author. Nowadays, research is often performed by big groups of researchers: some of them make significant contributions to the research results, while contributions of others are not as significant. So, a question naturally appears: when the results of this joint research are formulated in a paper, who should be included in the list of the paper\u2019s authors? This is a subject of many serious discussions, see, e.g., [13].\nWhy is this a difficult problem? In our opinion, the problem is difficult because there is no crisp, discrete separation between authors on the one hand and contributors who end up being thanked (but who are not listed as authors) on the other hand. In each group, there is an implicit threshold, so that participants whose contribution level is above this threshold are listed as authors, while those whose level of contribution is below this threshold are not. This threshold level varies between different research communities, between different research groups: e.g., many experimental papers have dozens of authors, while most theoretical papers usually have much fewer ones. And within each group, there is a certain level of subjectivity.\nBeing an author in several papers is critically important for students to defend their dissertations, important for job search, for promotion. As a result, the degree of subjectivity in deciding who is listed as an author (and who is not) often causes conflicts within the research groups \u2013 and these conflicts hinder possible collaboration and thus, in the long run, slow down the progress of science. How can we avoid this subjectivity?\nWhat we propose. We propose to take into account that being an author is, in effect, not a crisp notion. In many cases, it is a matter of degree. So instead of listing some collaborators as authors and others as non-authors, why not list everyone who contributed something intellectual to the result as authors \u2013 but with the corresponding degree of authorship?\nTo some extent, this is already done in some journals \u2013 where for each submitted paper, the authors have to agree on percentages of their contributions. But at present, this is only done with respect to participants who have already been declared authors. We propose to extend this idea to all the participants, including those who are usually not included in the authors\u2019 list.\nOf course, for this idea to work, we need to take into account this degree of authorship when evaluating the quality of a student\u2019s dissertation work, or the quality of the researcher. We believe that this \u2013 yet another \u2013 example of using the abovementioned Zadeh\u2019s principle will help resolve this issue.\nHow to assign the degree of authorship? For this idea to work, we need to have an acceptable way to assign degrees of authorship. In some cases, the authoring group includes a leader whose opinion everyone respects. In such cases, we can simply ask this trusted leader to provide the degrees of authorship.\nHowever, the very fact that often conflicts appear around this issue means that in many cases, people\u2019s opinions differ. In such cases, a natural idea is to ask different\nparticipants of the research group to provide such estimates \u2013 and then we need to come up with combined estimates that take into account all the opinions.\nFor every two participants i and j, let us denote the degree assigned to the participant i by the participant j by di j. In the beginning, we do not know a priori who contributed more \u2013 and thus, whose opinion is more informed and more valuable. Thus, in the first approximation, we can simply take the average of all the assigned degrees. In other words, as the first approximation a(0)i to the authorship degree assigned to each participant i, we can take the value\na(0)i = 1 N \u00b7\u2211\nj \u0338=i di j,\nwhere N is the normalizing constant \u2013 to make sure that the sum of all these degrees is, e.g., 1. If we want full objectivity, we do not ask each participant to estimate his/her degree of authorship, but if participants trust each other to be objective why not? If we add such degree dii, then the formula takes the simplified form\na(0)i = 1 N \u00b7\u2211\nj di j.\nWe can use the same simplified formulas in situations when we do not ask each participant for his/her own degree of authorship: in this case, we can simply take dii = 0, and the previous formula turns into this simplified form.\nNow we know \u2013 at least approximately \u2013 what was each person\u2019s contribution to the project, so it makes sense, instead of using the arithmetic average, to take the weighted average \u2013 in which the opinion of each participant j is weighted proportionally to this person\u2019s degree of authorship. This way, we get the next approximation a(1)i to the degree of authorship:\na(1)i = 1 N \u00b7\u2211 j di j \u00b7a(0)j .\nWe can use, as weights, these more accurate degrees of authorship, and we can made these updates again and again. In this procedure, onece we know the degree of authorship a(k)i on the k-th iteration, the degree of authorship on the next iteration can be computed as follows:\na(k+1)i = 1 N \u00b7\u2211 j di j \u00b7a(k)j .\nInterestingly, this is the same iterative process that leads to PageRank \u2013 a numerical criterion that Google search uses to rank possible answers to queries; see, e.g., [6]. In the limit, this process converges to limit values ai for which\nai = 1 N \u00b7\u2211 j di j \u00b7a j.\nFrom the mathematical viewpoint, the values ai form an eigenvector of the matrix di j \u2013 and in almost all cases, this is the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue.\nWhat if we take into account the uncertainty of the degrees? It is difficult for people to come up with exact numbers di j describing contributions of others: this is very subjective, and we do not think that it is possible to distinguish between, e.g., 50% and 51%. People are much more comfortable providing a range [di j,di j] of possible values, such as [0.6,0.7].\nIn this case, in the first approximation, we come up with interval of possible values of a(0)i :\n[a(0)i ,a (0) i ] = 1 N \u00b7\u2211\nj [di j,di j],\nwhere by sum \u2013 or any other operation \u2295 \u2013 between intervals we mean the range of the values a\u2295b when a and b lie in the corresponding intervals [a,a] and [b,b] (see, e.g., [3, 5, 8, 10]):\n[a,a]\u2295 [b,b] def= {a\u2295b : a \u2208 [a,a],b \u2208 [b,b]}.\nOnce we have an approximation [a(k)i ,a (k) i ], we can use these interval values as weights to compute the next approximation:\n[a(k+1)i ,a (k+1) i ] = 1 N \u00b7\u2211 j [di j,di j] \u00b7 [a (k) j ,a (k) j ].\nThe expression in the right-hand side is increasing in terms of d(k)i j and a (k) j , so:\n\u2022 its smallest possible value is attained when the values d(k)i j and a (k) j are the small-\nest possible, and \u2022 its largest possible value is attained when the values d(k)i j and a (k) j are the largest\npossible.\nIn other words, we have\na(k+1)i = 1 N \u00b7\u2211 j di j \u00b7a (k) j ,\nand a(k+1)i = 1 N \u00b7\u2211 j di j \u00b7a(k)j .\nThus, in the limit, we have an interval [ai,ai], where\nai = 1 N \u00b7\u2211 j di j \u00b7a j,\nand ai =\n1 N \u00b7\u2211 j di j \u00b7a j,\ni.e., where:\n\u2022 the values ai form an eigenvector of the matrix di j (corresponding to its largest eigenvalue), and \u2022 the values ai form an eigenvector of the matrix di j (corresponding to its largest eigenvalue)."
