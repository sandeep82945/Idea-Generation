    "abstractText": "We report on an optimization study of percussion drilling thin metal sheets employing a high repetition rate, high power femtosecond laser with respect to the resulting heat accumulation. A specified simplex algorithm was employed to optimize the spatial drilling sequence, whereas a simplified thermal simulation using COMSOL was validated by comparing its results to the temperature measurements using an infrared camera. Optimization for drilling borehole matrices was aspired with respect to the generated temperature across the processed specimen, while the drilling strategy was altered in its spatial drilling sequence and by using multi-spot approaches generated by a spatial light modulator. As a result, we found that an optimization strategy based on limited consecutive holes in a Moore neighborhood led to reduced temperatures and the shortest",

            "text": "Ultra-short pulsed (USP) laser machining processes are, in general, associated with low thermal input into the processed work piece and thus a negligible heat affected zone, often referred to as cold ablation [1,2]. However, for high repetition rate lasers with high pulse energies and thus high average powers, pulse-to-pulse interactions may result in heat accumulation [3,4]. Such lasers have recently reached industrial-grade, allowing for efficient material processing such as drilling thousands of micro-holes per second [5\u20138]. This heat accumulation, in turn, results in an unexpected low quality of USP laser processing [9\u201311]. Particularly for thin materials, the accumulated heat may lead to the bending of the processed material, leading to shifting of the specimen out of focus. As a consequence (e.g., for laser drilling), this can result in a discontinuation of the process or unevenly drilled holes. To optimize drilling processes toward a higher quality of hole matrices, the systematic heat accumulation must be investigated. Therefore, we simulated the thermal process during drilling a large number of micro-holes in the laser single and multi-spot mode, and experimentally measured the charged heat by an infrared camera. In particular, the size of the heat-affected zone, which results from a combination of laser parameters, the material properties, and the ablation process, is an important industry consideration for cutting and drilling applications using an USP laser. Aiming to increase the productivity of USP-processes, higher repetition rates and fluences are often used, which results in heat buildup and plasma shielding effects [12\u201316]. While heat accumulation generally results in negative effects, Gruner et al.

These experiments indicate a decreasing influence of the\nMaterials 2022, 15, 4829. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma15144829 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2022, 15, 4829 2 of 12\napplied fluence for very high repetition rates and a decreasing ablation threshold as a result of heat accumulation [6]. These findings are in agreement with Finger et al., who found an up to ten times higher ablation depth for increasing repetition rate, which was attributed to an increased energy transfer in combination with heat accumulation [4]. Bornschlegel et al. specifically investigated the heat formation during the USP-laser ablation of stainless steel 1.4301 by measuring the work piece temperature. By simulating the process with COMSOL Multiphysics, it was shown that the residual energy, which is below the ablation threshold of the Gaussian beam profile, does not contribute to the ablation process, but heats the surrounding material. In addition, the amount of residual energy that heats the surrounding material is shown to be larger the closer the applied fluence is to the ablation threshold of the material [17]. It can also be concluded that as long as the used fluence is similar to the calculated optimal range, which is around seven times the threshold fluence [18,19], a constant part of the heat input is an acceptable assumption. If the used fluence deviates significantly from this, non-uniform heating occurs during the process, so this assumption can no longer be made. Minor deviations can be explained by the plasma shielding effects due to the use of higher repetition rates [3,20,21]. Other authors have investigated the removal rate during a percussion drilling process due to the heat accumulation effects for different metals and laser parameters with a high power USP-laser with an average power of 300 W [22]. By doubling the pulse energy, the drilling time decreases two orders of magnitude, while a further increase only results in a slight reduction in drilling time, which can be explained by the particle lubrication effect [23]. Furthermore, in this study, the repetition rate showed no significant influence on the heat accumulation between 200 kHz and 800 kHz, which agreed with Zhao et al. [24]. Using pulse bursts, high ablation rates and a low surface roughness is possible [25]. Due to the high repetition rate, an increasing heat accumulation results in a higher absorption and rising ablation rate."

The laser was integrated into a micromachining system (RDX-1000, Pulsar Photonics, Herzogenrath, Germany) that used a galvo scanner (IntelliSCANse14, Scanlab, Pucheim, Germany) and an F-Theta lens (LINOS F-Theta Ronar, Qioptiq, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany) with a focal length of 100 mm. The focal diameter do, measured by a high-resolution CCD camera (UI149xLE, IDS, Obersulm, Germany) was 41 \u00b5m (1/e2). The resulting fluence was calculated according \u03a6 = Ep/ ( \u03c0\u00b7r20 ) , with Ep being the pulse energy and r0 the radius of the focal beam. Throughout the experiments explained in Section 4, a repetition rate of 50 kHz was used to drill the holes. A spatial light modulator (SLM)-based beam shaping module allows dynamic beam shaping to generate different spot distributions with a maximum frame rate of 60 Hz. To protect the LCOS-SLM (Hamamatsu X15223), an effective active liquid cooling system was integrated. The drilling process was performed using both single spot and a multi-spot (2 \u00d7 2) beam splitter with a separation between the spots of 100 \u00b5m. The beam profile including the intensity distribution of the 2 \u00d7 2 spot profiles is shown in Figure 1. The required computer generated holograms were calculated using an iterative Fourier transform algorithm. After the initial calculation of the hologram, the uniformity of the single sub-beams in the focal plane was further improved by a feedback loop based weighted Gerchberg\u2013Saxton algorithm [26]. Thus, a uniformity of 0.98 could be achieved for the four spot profiles shown in Figure 1. To evaluate the drilled holes, a digital microscope (Leica DVM6A, Wetzlar, Germany) was used.

Based on the material properties from Table 1 and Equation (2), this led to a calculated required power of Q0 = 0.68 W. Due to losses in the drilling process caused by pulse-to-pulse interactions as well as plasma and particle shielding, the determined value in the experimental tests was not sufficient to produce a fully drilled through-hole. Experimental tests, in which the used pulse energy was slowly increased at pulse energy of 4 \u00b5J, led to a through-hole in the material, which corresponded to an average power of Q0 = 0.8 W. This corrected value was used for the following tests as well as for the simulation. The resulting heat source of the simulation was calculated according to Equation (3).

Results and Discussion To investigate the heat propagation into the material during the drilling process and\nto verify the heat simulation, in the first step, the original drilling sequence (Figure 3a) was simulated without optimization and carried out experimentally (Figure 4).

Please note that the finely displayed profile of the simulated temperature graphs resulted from the significantly smaller calculation steps compared to the frame rate of the thermal imaging camera. The high agreement of the results from the simulation and experiment allows for the validation of the drilling process so that this can be used to demonstrate the effects of changing the drilling sequence. To reduce the temperature across the processed metal sheet by optimizing the drilling strategy, an approach from image processing was chosen [33,34]. The Moore neighborhood or figure-of-eight neighborhood considers the neighborhood relations of a defined pixel that is framed by other pixels in a square grid. The neighbors are all pixels that have at least one corner in common with the base area. Based on this principle, the whole array was now drilled in a box of nine (cf. Figure 3b), whereby a maximum of five holes could be drilled depending on the fulfillment of the sequence depicted in Figure 3b. Here, the number of drilled holes allowed in each 3 \u00d7 3 array in time window [t, t + 8] was set to 5 at the beginning, 3 after time t = 11, and 2 after time t = 21. For each 5 \u00d7 5 array, the number was three times as large. As a result of the optimization strategy, there were times t when no hole was drilled and the process was interrupted by a waiting period.\nFigure 3.

Materials 2022, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 12\nFurther drilling tests were carried out with the 2 \u00d7 2 beam splitter shown in Figure 1 due to a higher average power and thus a higher heat generation in the material. In addition, toward the benefit of responding to the industry\u2019s demand for larger borehole arrays, this has the effect of the appearance of annealing colors, on the basis of which further evidence is provided regarding the temperatures generated in the material. A drill hole position calculated by the optimization software or the respective time interval represents here the simultaneous drilling of four holes of square arrangement. For further comparison and evaluation, data from the thermal simulations and experiments are shown for a 20 \u00d7 20 array drilled with a 2 \u00d7 2 beam splitter in Figure 5. The recorded image clearly shows the annealing colors through which the line-by-line standard drilling strategy can be seen directly. As the number of drilled lines increases, the heat accumulates in the material, so that the average value increases step by step, as can also be seen in the diagram. Looking at the image of the array from the upper right corner diagonally to the lower left corner, the steady increase in the temperature in the diagram reflects the increase in the tempering colors in the image. Thus, the peak of accumulated heat of slightly below 435 \u00b0C resulted from the most recently drilled holes. As above-mentioned in the explanation of Figure 4, ten oscillations were again visible in the graph, although 20 rows were drilled in this experiment. This resulted from the use of a 2 \u00d7 2 beam splitter, so two rows were always drilled simultaneously. When comparing the simulated graph and the graph taken with the thermal imaging camera, an identical trend as well as the same temperature range were observed. Please note the reduced measurement resolution due the sampling rate of the camera compared to the simulation. Due to the significantly smaller calculation steps of the COMSOL simulation (0.005 s) compared to the thermal imaging (0.05 s) and the limited spatial resolution of the camera, the detection of temperature values was not ideal. It can be assumed that this aspect as well as the small size of the boreholes partly led to an error in the recording of the temperature values. The average or minimum temperature showed a similar course, but deviated significantly with respect to the absolute temperature, which is an indication of the described deviations with respect to the resolution possibilities. The maximum temperature was not or only slightly affected by this since only the pixel with the highest temperature value was evaluated. The cooling behavior, which was shown by a steeply sloping curve in both the simulation and the experiment, also agreed well.\ni ure 4.

For further comparison and evaluation, data from the thermal simulations and experiments are shown for a 20 \u00d7 20 array drilled with a 2 \u00d7 2 beam splitter in Figure 5. The recorded image clearly shows the annealing colors through which the line-by-line standard drilling strategy can be seen directly. As the number of drilled lines increases, the heat accumulates in the material, so that the average value increases step by step, as can also be seen in the diagram. Looking at the image of the array from the upper right corner diagonally to the lower left corner, the steady increase in the temperature in the diagram reflects the increase in the tempering colors in the image. Thus, the peak of accumulated heat of slightly below 435 \u25e6C resulted from the most recently drilled holes. As above-mentioned in the explanation of Figure 4, ten oscillations were again visible in the graph, although 20 rows were drilled in this experiment. This resulted from the use of a 2 \u00d7 2 beam splitter, so two rows were always drilled simultaneously. When comparing the simulated graph and the graph taken with the thermal imaging camera, an identical trend as well as the same temperature range were observed. Please note the reduced measurement resolution due the sampling rate of the camera compared to the simulation. Due to the significantly smaller calculation steps of the COMSOL simulation (0.005 s) compared to the thermal imaging (0.05 s) and the limited spatial resolution of the camera, the detection of temperature values was not ideal. It can be assumed that this aspect as well as the small size of the boreholes partly led to an error in the recording of the temperature values. The average or minimum temperature showed a similar course, but deviated significantly with respect to the absolute temperature, which is an indication of the described deviations with respect to the resolution possibilities. The maximum temperature was not or only slightly affected by this since only the pixel with the highest temperature value was evaluated. The cooling behavior, which was shown by a steeply sloping curve in both the simulation and the experiment, also agreed well. As can be seen in the diagrams, the maximum temperature could be reduced by about 75 \u25e6C to almost 360 \u25e6C using the optimized strategy. This and the significantly lower occurrence of annealing colors indicate a lower heat input in the component. When drilling with the optimized drilling strategy, there was also a constant increase in temperature up to the last hole, but this was much less pronounced. However, the behavior of a line-by-line increase in temperature was interrupted by the change in the drilling sequence. This resulted in the standard strategy with a decrease in the temperature after each drilled line, whereby, however, the temperature was higher with each line beginning than with the previous. This confirms the assumption that the material is not able to dissipate all the heat into the surrounding material and into the air after a line has been drilled, and this leads to heat accumulation. In addition to the optimized drilling strategy, the 25% longer process\nMaterials 2022, 15, 4829 8 of 12\ntime caused by the break times could be another reason for the qualitatively better drilling result. In order to reflect this increased process time in the initial sequence, and thus to exclude any effects that may occur, a corresponding delay of 1 ms was inserted between the drilling of the individual holes.

This shows that an optimized drilling strategy leads to an increase in quality with the same process time.\nIn the next step, the experiments were scaled up to a 48 \u00d7 48 array. The optimization of the drilling sequence was again calculated according to the Moore neighborhood. The obtained results, with the corrected process time by the inserted delay, which are shown in Figure 7, had similar characteristics as the results already shown in Figure 5. Again, the quality as indicated by the lower expression of annealing colors was higher and the temperature of the optimized strategy was lower compared to the standard drilling sequence. According to the 48 rows drilled in this experiment using a 2 \u00d7 2 beam splitter, 24 oscillations can be seen in the graph. However, it was noticeable that the proportion of annealing colors using the optimization had increased compared to the 20 \u00d7 20 array, which was also reflected in the lower difference in the maximum temperatures. The decrease in the effectiveness of the optimization was related to the fact that with larger arrays, a higher similarity to the standard strategy emerges. This results from the larger area and the associated property that there are only occasional wide jumps between successive boreholes and therefore the remaining boreholes are often drilled close together. On one hand, this results in fewer necessary break times and thus a shorter overall process time. The described trend correlates with the increasing component size, so that with a larger array, the advantage of optimization is smaller, but always evident.\nIn the next step, the experiments were scaled up to a 48 \u00d7 48 array.
