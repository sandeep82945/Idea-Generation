    "abstractText": "The average share of nuclear energy in electricity production is expected to increase under the background of the global pursuit towards carbon neutrality. Conjugating with its rapid development, the wave of decommissioning and dismantling (D&D) of nuclear facilities is coming. The surface decontamination is a prerequisite to D&D, which will make it easier and reduce the volume of radioactive wastes. However, there are no comprehensive studies on the decontamination methods, which is not helpful for the sustainable development of nuclear energy and environment protection. Therefore, in this work, the current status and future trends of global energy and nuclear energy are first analyzed. Then, various decontamination approaches are comparatively studied, including cleaning mechanisms, application subjects, and intrinsic advantages and disadvantages. Finally, the criteria and factors for selecting a decontamination process, the challenges, and future studies are directed. Among the mechanical methods, laser-based cleaning is high-speed, having automation ability, and thus is promising, although it creates a dust and airborne contaminant hazard. In further studies, factors such as selecting a proper laser facility, optimizing operating parameters, and designing a high-efficiency dust collection system could be studied. Regarding the chemical method, chemical gels are good for decontaminating complex shapes and vertical and overhead surfaces. In addition, they can enhance other decon agents\u2019 efficiency by improving contact time. However, the formulation of colloidal gels is complex and no gel type is useful for all contaminants. Therefore, novel and versatile gels need be developed to enlarge their application field. Combining various decontamination methods will often have better results and thus a reasonable and effective combination of these decontamination methods has become the main direction.",

Recently, fossil fuels such as oil, coal, and natural gas made up 83% of the global energy mix and will shrink to below 50% in 2050. For China, the share of primary energy from fossil fuels was larger than 90% before 2012 and declined to approximately 84% in 2020.

Share of China\u2019s primary energy.\nNuclear energy offers advantages of low-cost operation, low carbon emission and reliability, and has been recognized as one of the most environmentally friendly resources [5,6]. The transition from conventional sources of energy to nuclear energy is expected to reduce demand pressures on crude oil and protect the environment from greenhouse gas emissions. The average share of nuclear power in global electricity generation declined steadily from a peak of 17.6% in 1996 and stagnated at 10.5% since 2013. France, with the second largest nuclear electricity generation capacity, had the largest share of about 70.6% in 2020. Ukraine, Belgium, Finland, and Switzerland also have a significant share of nuclear power in their mix accounting for 51.2%, 39.1%, 33.9%, and 32.9%, respectively. Finnish utility Teollisuuden Voima Oyj has received permission from the country\u2019s Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority to bring the Olkiluoto 3 EPR to first criticality and conduct low-power tests. The unit is expected to begin regular electricity production in 2022. Poland also plans to have nuclear power from about 2033 as part of a diverse energy portfolio, moving it away from heavy dependence on coal. In China, nuclear plants contributed only about 4.9% in 2020 after growing slowly from 1.8% in 2010. There will\nFigure 1.

The average share of nuclear power in global electricity generation declined steadily from a peak of 17.6% in 1996 and stagnated at 10.5% since 2013. France, with the second largest nuclear electricity generation capacity, had the largest share of about 70.6% in 2020. Ukraine, Belgium, Finland, and Switzerland also have a significant share of nuclear power in their mix accounting for 51.2%, 39.1%, 33.9%, and 32.9%, respectively. Finnish utility Teollisuuden Voima Oyj has received permission from the country\u2019s Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority t bring the Olkiluoto 3 EPR to first criticality a d conduct low-power tests. The unit is expected to begin regular electricity roduction in 2022. Poland also plans to have nuclear power from about 2033 as part of a diverse energy portfolio, moving it away from heavy dependence on coal. In China, nuclear plants contributed only about 4.9% in 2020 after growing slowly from 1.8% in 2010. There will be tremendous room to grow under the background of carbon neutrality and it is expected to account for approximately 10% in 2030 and 19% in 2060 (Figure 2).\nSustainability 2022, 14, 4021 3 of 19\nSustainability 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 20 be tremendous room to grow under the background of carbon neutrality and it is expected to account for approximately 10% in 2030 and 19% in 2060 (Figure 2).\nCurrently, there are approximately 447 nuclear power reactors operating around the world, providing about 10% of the world\u2019s electricity. The United States has 55 commercially operating nuclear power plants with 93 nuclear power reactors, followed by France, China, Russia, and Japan with 56, 51, 38, and 33 reactors (Figure 3). To achieve the carbon neutrality goal, China is on track to surpass the USA as the world\u2019s top producer of nuclear energy with more than 100 commercial nuclear reactors as early as 2030. However, each nuclear plant must be decommissioned after the reactors reach their operational life. Of those reactors, nearly 70% are older than 30 years and 25% exceed 40 years. According to the International Energy Agency, around 200 commercial reactors may be shut down between 2020 and 2040.\nFigure 3.

            "text": "Decontamination is defined as the removal of contaminants from surfaces by washing, heating, or chemical, electrochemical, or mechanical action. It is mainly applied in nuclear facility equipment and components, including building exteriors and interiors, equipment, pavement, and vehicles. Sometimes, it can also concern the removal of radioactivity situated deep in the material. During the decontaminating processes, two points need to be better understood. The first is to clarify the parts that need be decontaminated, and the second is to know the source of the contaminants. The radioactive contamination is caused by radionuclide contaminants on surfaces through mechanical adsorption, physical adsorption, or chemical reactions with different base materials, such as stainless steel, rubber, plastic, etc. [11\u201313]. The mechanical adsorption is resulted from the imbedding and adhesion of radionuclides in the defect of the material surface. The physical adsorption is generated because some materials\u2019 surfaces have charges and the radionuclides with opposite charge are adhered on their surfaces. The chemical reaction is caused by various reactions, such as ion exchange and isotopic exchange between radionuclides with ionic form and materials. The type of contamination is determined by the radionuclides and base material, as well as the system. The main forms of radionuclides binding to the surface include [8]: (1) Nonfixed contaminants attached to the surface by intermolecular forces. There is no reaction between radionuclides and base materials. The combination between them is weak and this contaminant is easy to be removed. (2) Weakly fixed contaminants formed through chemical adsorption or ion exchange. The combination is strong, and the radionuclides penetrate the base material with a considerable depth resulting the difficulty of radionuclides to be removed. (3) Deep surface contamination formed by radionuclides diffusing to the base or neutron irradiation activation of trace elements in the base. This contamination is difficult to be dealt with as well. Contamination can also be classified as being \u201cfixed\u201d and \u201cloose (or free)\u201d. Fixed contamination is that which is not transferred from a contaminated surface to an uncontaminated surface when two surfaces accidently touch. The radioactive material cannot be spread, since it is chemically or mechanically bound to structures. It cannot be removed by common cleaning methods. As a comparison, loose contamination is that which may be readily transferred under these circumstances. The radioactive material can be spread, and this contamination can easily be removed with simple decontamination methods. Therefore, in response to different levels of surface contamination and the requirements for decontamination effects, it is necessary to choose a reasonable and economic decontamination technique."

            "text": "During the surface decontamination of nuclear facilities, the focus is not only on the surface deposition layer but also taking into account the radionuclide migration. Recently,\nSustainability 2022, 14, 4021 6 of 19\nsome methods have been developed to probe the diffusion and migration of radionuclides in the micro area, such as scanning proton microprobe, synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence, and analytical transmission electron microscopy, etc. These studies will provide critical information for decision-making regarding the decontamination and management of contaminated facilities. Shuai et al. [18] studied the migration of 235U in rubber and cable used for uranium storage by neutron activation analysis and \u03b3 spectrum analysis. The results showed that the permeation depth of 235U in rubber ranged from ten to one hundred micrometers. Gao et al. [19] studied the decomposition of a pipe storing intermediate level liquid waste using laser decontamination techniques. It was difficult to achieve the decontamination factor of more than 100\u00d7 with radiation intensity larger than 10 J/cm2 and high-frequency scanning. The deposition lay of samples after decontamination still had strong radiation. It indicated that the radioactivity of the deposition layer is just a proportion of radioactivity in the pipe and some radionuclides had penetrated into the sub-surface of the base material. Stainless steel is a common structural material used in a nuclear power plant due to their better mechanical properties and corrosion resistance. The chromium-enriched oxide film on the stainless-steel surface is an important barrier to protect the substrate from external contamination. However, the radionuclides could accumulate at the steel grain boundaries at high temperatures and penetrate into the steel subsurface. Lang et al., [13,20] probed the 90Sr and 134,137Cs uptake onto and distribution in AISI Type 304 stainless steel. Under passivating conditions, 90Sr and 134,137Cs were maintained at the steel surface by sorption/selective incorporation into the Cr-rich passive film. However, under transpassive conditions (12 M HNO3), corrosion and severe intergranular attack led to 90Sr diffusion into the passive layer and steel subsurface. 90Sr and 134,137Cs accumulation was also commensurate with corrosion product (Fe and Cr) re-adsorption. Xie et al. [21] simulated the contamination of 316L stainless steel with 90Sr and 135Cs. The 90Sr and 135Cs contents on the surface reached the maximum at 21 days. Due to dissolution of the oxide layer and diffusion of the contaminants to the matrix, the concentrations of 90Sr and 135Cs decreased and maintained at a stable state after 30 days. There were two species of 90Sr on the steel surface, namely SrCrO4 in the oxide layer, and SrCO3 in the matrix. Taylor-Underhill [22] probed the mechanism of cesium and strontium contamination in AISI type 304H stainless steel. Stable Sr contaminations were more pronounced than stable Cs contamination on stainless steel surfaces. Sr was found to penetrate the steel and does not desorb with a change in pH. From these above reports (Table 1), it can be found that the depth distribution of radionuclides such as 235U, 90Sr, and 137Cs in some base materials have been investigated using the laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and \u03b3-ray spectrometry. The penetrating depth varied depending on the physicochemical properties of base materials, nature of radionuclides, etc. (Figure 4). Cs had similar contamination behaviors to Sr, but it was more inclined to surface than Sr. The majority of Sr remained near the base material surface and did not penetrate beneath the surface. Therefore, the penetration depth of Sr was smaller than that of Cs. Tritium is considered as an important fuel for fusion reaction and stainless steel is commonly used as a candidate structural material to make tritium containers, the facility, and the pipe. During long-term application, the tritium penetrates the stainless steel through adsorption and diffusion, resulting in the structure performance degradation and threatening the safety of the stainless steel for use. Many pieces of research have been conducted to study the distribution and speciation of tritium in stainless steel. The tritium is mainly in the form of tritiated water vapor (HTO) and tritiated hydrogen (HT). The distribution of tritium varies based on the tritium storing condition and place. Hirabayashi et al. [23] investigated the sorption of gaseous tritium in 316 stainless steel. The tritium was released as HTO with a fraction of HT during gradual surface etching. The HTO mostly originated from the tritium present on the outermost surface and about 90% of it could be easily released. The rest was sorbed tightly and remained in the surface layer. Wang et al. [24] studied the distribution and forming of tritium in RAFM steel. The tritium retained in steel was mainly in the non-soluble form, whose content was significantly larger\nSustainability 2022, 14, 4021 7 of 19\nthan that of soluble tritium. It was speculated the main form of tritium which existed in the defects of both steels was hydrogen isotope molecules, hydrocarbons (CH3T), or an atomic tritium cluster trapped by a dislocation cluster. Sharpe et al. [25] also investigated the distribution of tritium in the near-surface of 316 stainless steel. The concentration profiles indicated that the adsorbed water layers contained tritium surface concentrations of 1.5 \u00d7 1013 Bq/cm3, which decreased by a factor of 106 after etching to a depth of ~10 \u00b5m. Knowledge of tritium distribution in contaminated base materials and release is important in terms of safety of the facility\u2019s maintenance and decommissioning. There have been some studies on the diffusion transport characteristics of deuterium and tritium in the base materials [26\u201328]; however, there are fewer reports on deuterium. The interactions of deuterium and tritium (dissolution, diffusion, and penetration) between bulk materials and the decay products of radionuclides in materials need be further studied.

The solid pellets sublime directly after impact on the surface, leaving no solid residue after blasting. It has been extensively used for cleaning surfaces, removing paint, or stripping contaminants from a surface. Masserant [42] designed a system for cleaning components contaminated with radioactive materials which uses dry ice blasting in a chamber. The bead reaction and thermal quenching by dry ice blasting was used to remove oxide layers formed on the stainless steel and carbon steel surfaces. The EDX analysis confirmed that oxide layers formed on the samples were successfully removed. Zeng et al. [43] prepared LaMgAl11O19 coatings with implanted vertical microcracks utilizing the \u2018quenching\u2019 effect of in situ dry ice blasting during the atmospheric plasma spraying process. Najafabadi and Khajavi [44] produced micro cracks on the primary wall of raw cotton through a thermal shock process by using frozen carbon dioxide. The blasting mechanism of dry ice was based on the cooling down of the surface up to a temperature of \u221278.51 \u25e6C, which caused cracks and separation between the interface of different layers. Dry ice blasting is a simple, nonabrasive cleaning method. Compared to other blast cleaning processes, it does not accumulate contaminants in the waste stream and thus significantly reduces the amount of secondary waste for disposal. However, some painted surfaces can be damaged by the process due to its high pressure.\n4.1.3. Laser-Based Cleaning\nLaser-based cleaning is removing contaminants deeply embedded within the material surface by physically stripping the entire upper layer of the base material using laser irradiation. It is a noncontact/nonabrasive process that can replace the use of chemicals or abrasive cleaning. The cleaning process can be conducted remotely by a fiber-optic beam delivery system, and the laser head can be manipulated by robots, thus avoiding exposing workers to a potentially radioactive area. Typical mechanisms of laser cleaning are evaporation/spallation/ablation/shockwave generation. The resulting mechanisms cause the removal of the contaminants without causing any damage to the substrate. Demos et al. [45] investigated the mechanisms governing the interaction of metallic particles with nanosecond laser pulses. The formation of the pit was attributed to the interaction of the substrate with the plasma. A dependence of pit size on the pulse shape and pulse durations was observed. Within the area of laser cleaning, several working mechanisms and processing types have been proposed, including dry laser cleaning, wet laser cleaning,\nSustainability 2022, 14, 4021 10 of 19\nangular laser cleaning, shock laser cleaning, and hydrodynamics-based laser cleaning. In wet cleaning [46], the thin layer of liquid is sprayed onto the porous encrustation prior to laser irradiation. When laser irradiation starts, both the encrustation and liquid are heated. Once the temperature reaches the boiling point of liquid, it is vaporized immediately. If the pressure is larger than the reduced tensile strength of encrustation, the encrustation may be stripped away locally. Related with the laser shock cleaning process, laser-induced breakdown (LIB) occurs in a liquid solution and the shock wave generated in the liquid enhances the cleaning process significantly. However, it is difficult to control the purity of the cleaning solutions as the particle size decreases. Therefore, much effort has been devoted to dry laser cleaning due to its simplicity. AJ Potiens Jr et al. [47] studied the decontamination of the 241Am-contaminated metal scrap generated in the treatment of radioactive lightning rods. The laser used was a nanosecond Nd:YAG, operating in 1064 nm, with a pulse duration of 5 ns and 300 mJ per pulse. It confirmed that this process was effective and generated the lowest volume of secondary waste. The secondary wastes generated were only the stripped paint and the HEPA filters. Greifzu et al. [10] applied a Nd:YAG laser with pulse width of 105\u2013230 ns and wavelength of 1064 nm during epoxy paint surfaces\u2019 cleaning. The effects of laser fluence and pulse duration on the decontamination factor was studied. The optimized parameters enabled the selective removal of the decontamination paint without any heat impact to the metallic substrates. The reduction in 60Co, 137Cs-137, and 90Sr-90 concentrations after decontamination were 62%, 98.7%, and 96%, respectively. The commonly used lasers include CO2 laser, Nd: YAG laser, excimer laser, and diode laser. It has been proved that the laser intensity, laser frequency, laser angle, laser scanning speed, and laser peak power have effects on the decontamination factor. Recently, there have been many studies on the laser-based decontamination of different materials (stainless steels in loop cooling system, high-level pipes for fluid transport, contaminated reactor components) in Japan, South Korea and France, including the Japan Atomic Energy Agency, FUGEN Decommissioning Engineering Center, Osaka University, French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission, etc. In China, some research on contaminant cleaning using low-power laser were conducted by institutes, such as the China Institute of Atomic Energy, Nuclear Power Institute of China, and China Academy of Engineering Physics. Li et al. [48] investigated factors, pulse width, gas pressure, sweep path, and scan times on the decontamination depth and roughness. The results showed that the laser width was proportional to the single removal depth and the shading roughness. The scanning path had effects on the removal efficiency and roughness of the shading. The auxiliary gas cannot effectively deepen the decontamination depth and improve the shading roughness. Hu and Wang [49] studied the effects of laser pulse frequency, laser power density, and laser cleaning rate on the laser cleaning effect of cerium oxide coating on the stainless steel. There was no significant cleaning effect with pulse frequency of 20\u2013100 kHz. The optimal cleaning parameters were determined as a laser energy density of 4.67 W/mm, and cleaning rate of 10 mm/s. Ma et al. [50] also investigated different parameters such as laser intensity, frequency, angel, and scanning speed in the decontamination factor. The decontamination factor of 216 and peeling depth of 15.86 \u00b5m were achieved with a radiation intensity of 7 J/cm2, pulse frequency of 10 Hz, scanning speed of 1.0 mm/s, and irradiation angle of 15\u25e6. In recent years, laser-based cleaning has attracted much attention due to its advantages of precise treatment, high selectivity, and flexibility in comparison with conventional cleaning techniques. However, further studies need to be conducted to select the proper laser facility and parameters, and design protective devices and waste collection systems during cleaning according to the radionuclide characteristics and practical demand.\n4.1.4. Nonthermal Plasmas\nPlasma is usually generated by electrical discharges and can primarily be divided into thermal (hot) or nonthermal (cold) plasmas according to their gas temperature. In thermal plasmas, the gas temperature can reach several thousand degrees Kelvin, while in the nonthermal case the temperature is close to ambient temperature. Since thermal plasma\nSustainability 2022, 14, 4021 11 of 19\nhas a very high temperature, it would melt substances rather than perform any chemical etching. By contrast, nonthermal plasmas generate plasma at atmospheric pressure while maintaining their nonthermal nature [51]. Windarto et al. [52] were the first to use atmospheric pressure nonthermal plasma for radioactive decontamination. They applied CF4-O2-based microwave discharge to remove radioactive CoO2 from the stainless-steel surface. After that, other groups worked on this, confirming that atmospheric pressure nonthermal plasma etching with CF4-O2 plasma mixture was efficient for surface decontamination [53,54]. Kar et al. [55] showed that it is very much possible to make a microwave-based atmospheric pressure plasma jet device for radioactive decontamination, and only 100 watts of microwave power are sufficient to remove 92% Pu from solid surfaces. Petrovskaya et al. [56] proposed a dry method by the ion sputtering of the nanoand micro-sized radioactive layers from the contaminated surface. The nonthermal plasma technique is of a high efficiency and capable of cleaning a wide range of contaminants in a few seconds. However, the initial cost for a facility is slightly higher."

            "text": "Chemical methods are mainly based on reactions such as dissolution, oxidation/reduction, complexation, and sequestration to remove contaminants from the surface. This method mainly includes reagent washing, foam decontamination, chemical gel, strippable coating, electrochemical gel decontamination, etc. Reagents used for chemical decon approach include water alone or with soap, surfactants, acids, bases, chelating agents, or redox changing agents. Foams, gels, or pastes are used to provide a longer contact time and thereby enhance removal.\n4.2.1. Reagent Washing\nReagent washing is a simple decontamination method, which is more effective for smooth nonporous surfaces. Many decon solutions have been applied, the use of which depends on the contaminant and surface chemistry, as well as the secondary waste generated. Typical reagents used in decontamination solutions include water, detergents and surfactants, acids, chelators, redox agents, foams and gels, and hybrid and proprietary solutions (Table 2). Among them, water is available for most ionic compounds and mainly applied to smearable contamination. Its decontamination efficiency can be improved by increasing temperature or adding wetting agents and detergents. Most commercial detergents have a detergent acting as a wetting agent or surfactant. While detergents have limited effectiveness by themselves, they are effective at enhancing other decon solutions. Surfactants can decrease the surface tension and increase liquid contact with the contaminated surface. The role of acids is to react with and dissolve metal oxide films containing contaminations or to etch the base metal and release the contaminant. Compared with inorganic acids, the organic acids offer advantages of safer handling and the ability to sequester contaminants. Kim et al. [57] developed a washing\u2013electrokinetic technology with the combination of inorganic and organic acids. The concrete was first washed with hydrochloric acid to decompose CaCO3 and thus decrease the pH of concrete. The 60Co and 137Cs removal efficiency were 85% and 76.3% at this stage. Then, the electrokinetic method was applied with acetic acid with 60Co and 137Cs removal of 99.7% and 99.6%, respectively. Chelation techniques are best used on nonporous surfaces and generally applied to fixed contamination that is not readily removed by simpler methods. Complexing agents are often used in combination with detergents, acids, and oxidizing agents. Reduction and oxidation agents are used to change the oxidation state of a metal and make it more soluble or more conducive to other decon methods. Foams and gels are used as carrier media for other decontamination agents. They have little decontamination ability by themselves but can enhance other agents\u2019 efficiency by sticking to a surface and providing longer contact times. Hybrid and proprietary solutions can increase the decontamination factor over conventional washes. These systems combine several solution types and use gels, foams, pastes, and combinations of each for delivery and enhanced efficiency. Argonne National\nSustainability 2022, 14, 4021 12 of 19\nLaboratory (ANL) developed a Supergel system that incorporated nanoparticle technology. Idaho National Laboratory (INL) revealed a long-lasting foam and clay paste system that remained in place for extended times [58].\n4.2.2. Foam Decontamination\nFoam decontamination, also known as decon foam, is achieved by spraying the detergents and wetting agents with hydrophilic groups or hydrophobic groups with a high pressure [76]. The foam, as a carrier for chemical decontamination agents, is formed on the facility surface, which collapses after decontamination and drains away. It produces lowvolume secondary waste and has been applied to a series of large carbon steel valves having complex internal configuration. Yoon et al. [77\u201380] prepared a foam for the decontamination of stainless-steel specimens contaminated with radionuclide 60Co. The Zonyl TBS and mesoporous silica nanoparticles combined with chemical reagents had a significant effect on the decontamination efficiency. Approximately 73% of the 60Co was removed, close to that obtained with the chemical decontamination solution alone, i.e., 80%. As compared to the use of chemical decontamination solution, the decontamination foam decreased the secondary waste by 80%. To overcome the low efficiency for conventional waterbased foam in winter, Zhang et al. [81] fabricated an antifreeze foam using a biomassbased surfactant, a polysaccharide foam stabilizer, and an antifreeze agent. With the temperature dropping from 10 to \u221210 \u25e6C, the viscosity of the foam solution significantly increased, and the half-life of the foam increased from 181.5 to 2758 min. It is worth noting that decontamination efficiency may be decreased if foams are unstable. Therefore, it is the key issue for a successful decontamination process to stabilize the decontamination foam. Improving foam stability can lead to the increase in decontamination time, which is conducive to improving the decontamination efficiency. Sonn et al. [75] used coupling agent dimethyldichlorosilane (DMDCS) to modify the silica nanoparticles, and the foam stability reached the maximum with a DMDCS concentration of 0.025 wt%. This may be attributed to the fact that hydrophobic silica particles adsorbed around the foams and prevented foam coalescence and disproportionation.\nSustainability 2022, 14, 4021 13 of 19\n4.2.3. Chemical Gels\nThe use of chemical gels aims to overcome problems associated with chemical-based decontamination techniques, such as reagent baths, foaming solutions, or solvents. The gels are commonly prepared by dispersing thickening agents, such as silica or alumina particles in solution, forming a gel-like suspension. The excellent rheological properties for decontamination gels allow them to be sprayed and remain attached to surface. This allows the implementation of this technique over large surfaces at large scale. The gels crack after drying, forming non-dust flakes where the contaminants are trapped and are easily removed by brushing or vacuum cleaning (Figure 6). It offers advantages of safe handling, high penetration, and small volumes of secondary waste [74,82]. Gurau and Deju [83] used commercial DeconGel\u2122 1101 to remove 60Co and 137Cs radionuclides during the decommissioning of a nuclear research reactor. The decontamination process was more efficient for nonporous materials and the decontamination factors could reach more than 90%. Yang et al. [84] developed a polyvinyl alcohol\u2013borax complex-based spray coating containing adsorbents (Prussian blue, bentonite, and sulfur-zeolite) for the decontamination of 137Cs-contaminated surfaces. The gel-like coating adhered to vertical surfaces with a 137Cs removal efficiency of 56.9%, as compared with 27.2% for DeconGel. In addition, the coating could be easily removed by rinsing with water leaving no residue. Moore et al. [82] prepared a nitric-acid-loaded polymer hydrogel with a high removal of 137Cs and 90Sr on stainless steel. Yang et al. [85] prepared a strippable hydrogel composed of polyvinyl alcohol and phenylboronic acid grafted alignate for the decontamination of 137Cs-contaminated surfaces. It displayed high removal efficiencies of 91.61% for painted cement, 97.505% for aluminum, 94.05% for stainless steel, and 53.5% for cement, 2.3 times higher than that of commercial Decongel. The adsorbent can be separated from the used hydrogel by a simple magnetic separation, which can reduce the waste disposal cost.

Electrochemical Method\nElectrochemical decontamination includes electrolysis, electrophoresis, and electro osmosis [88], in which processing the contaminated surface is immersed in a certain electrolyte as the anode. The electrolysis corrodes the anode, so that the nuclide pollutants in the metal surface layer are dissolved into the electrolyte solution achieving the purpose of removing nuclides. Compared to other chemical decontamination technology, the solution can be reused by filtering and adding an electrolyte. It is suitable for deep decontamination of carbon steel, stainless steel, aluminum, and other metal surfaces produced during the decommissioning of nuclear facilities. Pavlyuk et al. [89] investigated the electrochemical decontamination of irradiated nuclear graphite in an acid medium. The reduction in 60Co activity by a factor of 2\u201310 and Cs activity by a factor of 7\u2013100 was achieved. Lu et al. [88] coupled electrochemical decontamination with ultrasonic technology, and the decontamination effect was compared with that for individual electrochemical decontamination. The results indicated that the ultrasonic-assisted electrochemical decontamination had advantages such as good decontamination efficiency, simple equipment, fewer chemical reagents, etc. Pujol et al. [90] used the electro-coagulation technique to remove uranium from stainless steel. The removal efficiencies of 90% uranium were obtained in using a molar solution of H2SO4 as a support electrolyte and a potential of 2.4 V. The electrochemical method has a high efficiency with a small volume of secondary waste. However, the saturated solutions require appropriate processes for final treatment."

The selection of proper technologies in practice mainly depends on: the type of facilities, involved isotopes, activity level of the equipment and parts, and physical/chemical properties of the equipment/parts to be dismantled. The perspectives, such as safety, efficiency, cost-effectiveness, waste minimization, and feasibility of industrialization need be taken into account in the selection. Among the mechanical methods, the laser-based cleaning is high-speed, having automation ability and thus is promising, although creates a dust and results in airborne contaminant hazard. Further studies, such as selecting a proper laser facility, optimizing operating parameters, and designing a high-efficiency dust collection system (e.g., bag filter, high-efficiency particulate air filter) could be studied to promote its large-scale application. Among the chemical methods, the chemical gel is good for decontaminating complex shapes, and vertical and overhead surfaces. In addition, they can enhance other decon agents\u2019 efficiency by allowing them to stick to surfaces and improving contact time. However, the formulation of colloidal gels is complex, and no gel type is useful for all contaminants. Therefore, novel and versatile gels need be developed to enlarge their application field.

Combining various decontamination\nSustainability 2022, 14, 4021 15 of 19\nmethods will often have better results.

The decontamination methods mainly include mechanical and chemical decontaminations, which are diverse from the perspective of decontamination mechanism, application scope, the cost and volume of secondary waste generated, etc. Among them, the mechanical decontamination methods are generally more effective than chemical decontamination but requires the surface to be readily accessible. Corners, cracks, and crevices are difficult to decontaminate using mechanical techniques. These approaches also tend to create dust, resulting in airborne contaminants. In addition, laser-based cleaning has remote operation capability, which can reduce time consumption and worker exposure to irradiation. Dry ice blasting is a simple, nonabrasive cleaning method. The solid pellets sublime directly after impact on the surface, significantly reducing the amount of secondary waste for disposal. Regarding the chemical methods, they have the advantages of allowing the treatment of complex materials (e.g., hidden parts, inside parts of tubes, etc.), rich practice experience, and removing almost all radionuclides with the proper chemicals. However, there are some drawbacks, such as different isotopes require different solvents, the poor performance on porous surfaces, and corrosion of the surfaces being cleaned. Chemical gels and strippable coating offer the advantages of easy application and increased contact time which aid performance, no airborne contamination, and they can reach remote and hidden areas. The problem is that the formulation of colloidal gels are complex, which may require repeated applications to achieve the maximum effectiveness.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, Z.Y. and H.X.; methodology, S.L. and Y.H.; formal analysis, Y.G.; investigation, S.L. and Y.L.; resources, S.L. and B.W.; data curation, X.C. and Y.S.; writing\u2014 original draft preparation, S.L. and B.W.; writing\u2014review and editing, M.J. and J.L.; project administration, Z.Y. and H.X.; funding acquisition, Z.Y.
