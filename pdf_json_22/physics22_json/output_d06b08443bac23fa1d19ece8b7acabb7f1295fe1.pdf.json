    "abstractText": "In this paper, f (R, T, R\u03bc\u03bdT) gravity is considered. It is a modified theory of gravity that exhibits a strong coupling of gravitational and matter fields. Therefore, if gravity is governed by this model a number of issues must be re-examined. In this context, the question of causality and its violation is studied. Such analysis is carried out using the G\u00f6del-type solutions. It is shown that this model allows both causal and non-causal solutions. These solutions depend directly on the content of matter present in the universe. For the non-causal solution, a critical radius is calculated, beyond which causality is violated. Taking different matter contents, an infinite critical radius emerges that leads to a causal solution. In this causal solution, a natural relationship emerges between the parameters that determine the matter considered.",

            "text": "A widely accepted fact in the scientific community is the accelerated expansion of the universe which is strongly supported by observations [1\u20137]. Since the General Relativity theory (GR) does not adequately explain this phenomenon, two ways have been investigated: (i) exotic component of the matter, called dark energy, has been considered, or (ii) alternative models to the GR have been proposed. In this paper, the study developed considers the second case, i.e. modified gravity theory. The f (R) theory is the simplest and most popular way to modify GR [8]. Several studies have already been done on this type of theory, such as the Newtonian limit [9], gravitational stability [10], cosmological evolution of solar-system tests [11], inflation [12], among others. Another theory is f (R, T ) gravity [13], which is a generalization of f (R) theory. In this case, the Ricci scalar R in the HilbertEinstein action is changed by some function dependent on\na e-mail: junior@fisica.ufmt.br b e-mail: alesandroferreira@fisica.ufmt.br (corresponding author)\nthe Ricci scalar R and the trace of the energy\u2013momentum tensor T . The dependence on T can be induced by imperfect fluids or conformal anomalies arising from quantum effects [14,15]. This gravitational theory has also been considered in the context of Palatini formalism. In general, Palatini-type theories are very attractive as they present a good analysis of the initial and current dynamics of the universe [16\u201318].\nIn the present work, an extension of f (R, T ) gravity is proposed. The action is described by a function f (R, T, R\u03bc\u03bdT\u03bc\u03bd) where R\u03bc\u03bd and T\u03bc\u03bd are the Ricci tensor and the energy\u2013momentum tensor, respectively. The stability of this theory has been investigated in various contexts, such as, stability analysis of stellar radiating filaments [19], stability of cylindrical stellar model [20] and stability of Einstein Universe [21]. Furthermore, f (R, T, R\u03bc\u03bdT\u03bc\u03bd) gravity has already been investigated in CDM Universe [22], cosmic evolution in the background of non-minimal coupling [23], among others. However, study about causality and its violation has not been investigated in this theory. This is an important test to be performed by all alternative gravitational theories, since GR allows for such a discussion.\nTo investigate the causality problem in f (R, T, R\u03bc\u03bdT\u03bc\u03bd) gravity the G\u00f6del-type metric [24] is considered. It is a generalization of the G\u00f6del metric proposed by Kurt G\u00f6del, in 1949 [25]. It is the first exact solution for the GR with rotating matter. This metric leads to the possibility of Closed Timelike Curves (CTCs). These CTCs are not exclusive to the G\u00f6del solution, they appear in other cosmological models that have some hyperbolic or spherical symmetry, such as Kerr black hole, Van-Stockum model, cosmic string, among others [26,27]. The G\u00f6del-type metric provides more information about the violation of causality. It allows the calculation of a critical radius rc that defines causal and non-causal regions. The causality problem has already been studied in several different models. In [28] it shows that G\u00f6del and typeG\u00f6del are solutions to the f (R) theory, as well as in [29] that both G\u00f6del and type-G\u00f6del are solutions to the k-essence\ntheory. Causality is also discussed in Chern\u2013Simons gravity [30,31], f (T ) gravity [32], f (R, T ) gravity [33], bumblebee gravity [34], Horava\u2013Lifshitz gravity [35], Brans\u2013Dicke theory [36] and f (R, Q) gravity [37]. More recently causality is discuss in f (R, \u03c6, X) and f (R, T ) Palatini gravity [38,39]. In this paper, the main objective is to investigate whether the f (R, T, R\u03bc\u03bdT\u03bc\u03bd) gravity allows for causality violation. The analysis is divided into two parts, first the content of matter is just a perfect fluid and then the content of matter is a perfect fluid plus a scalar field.\nThe present paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, f (R, T, R\u03bc\u03bdT\u03bc\u03bd) gravity is introduced and the field equations are derived. In Sect. 3, the G\u00f6del-type metric is discussed. Considering a perfect fluid as matter content, the standard G\u00f6del solution is obtained. In Sect. 4, the problem of causality is verified for a perfect fluid plus a scalar field as the content of matter. This content of matter leads to a causal G\u00f6del-type solution. In Sect. 5, remarks and conclusions are presented.\n2 f (R, T, R\u03bc\u03bdT\u03bc\u03bd) gravity\nIn this section, the gravitational field equations for f (R, T, R\u03bc\u03bdT\u03bc\u03bd) gravity are obtained. The action that describes this theory is\nS = 1 2\u03ba2\n\u222b d4x \u221a\u2212g [ f (R, T, R\u03bc\u03bdT\u03bc\u03bd) + Lm] , (1)\nwhere \u03ba2 = 8\u03c0G, g is the determinant of the metric tensor g\u03bc\u03bd , R is the Ricci scalar, f (R, T, R\u03bc\u03bdT\u03bc\u03bd) is a function that depends on the Ricci scalar, the trace of energy\u2013momentum and the tensor product R\u03bc\u03bdT\u03bc\u03bd , respectively, and Lm is the matter Lagrangian.\nVarying the action (1) in relation to the metric g\u03bc\u03bd leads to\n\u03b4S = 1 2\u03ba2\n\u222b d4x\n\u00d7 [\u03b4\u221a\u2212g f + \u221a\u2212g ( fR\u03b4R + fT \u03b4T + fQ\u03b4R\u03bc\u03bdT\u03bc\u03bd)]\n+ \u222b d4x\u03b4 (\u221a\u2212gLm) , (2)\nwith fR \u2261 \u2202 f\u2202R , fT \u2261 \u2202 f\u2202T and fQ \u2261 \u2202 f\u2202Q , where Q \u2261 R\u03bc\u03bdT\u03bc\u03bd .\nConsidering the definition of the energy\u2013momentum tensor, we get\nT\u03bc\u03bd = \u22122\u221a\u2212g \u2202 (\u221a\u2212gLm) \u2202g\u03bc\u03bd = \u22122 \u2202Lm \u2202g\u03bc\u03bd + g\u03bc\u03bdLm, (3)\nwhere Lm is assumed to be dependent only on the metric and not on the first derivatives. The variation in the energy\u2013\nmomentum tensor trace is given as \u03b4T = \u03b4 (g\u03b1\u03b2T\u03b1\u03b2) , (4) = ( \u03b4g\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03b4g\u03bc\u03bd\n) T\u03b1\u03b2 + \u03b4T\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03b4g\u03bc\u03bd g\u03b1\u03b2, (5)\n= (T\u03bc\u03bd + \u03bc\u03bd) , (6) with \u03bc\u03bd being a tensor defined as\n\u03bc\u03bd \u2261 \u03b4T\u03b1\u03b2 \u03b4g\u03bc\u03bd g\u03b1\u03b2.

(8)\nThe variations \u03b4R and \u03b4T are known [40]. They are given as\nfR\u03b4R + fT \u03b4T = [R\u03bc\u03bd fR + (g\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u2207\u03bc\u2207\u03bd) fR + (T\u03bc\u03bd + \u03bc\u03bd) fT ] \u03b4g\u03bc\u03bd.\n(9)\nThe variation corresponding to the term R\u03bc\u03bdT\u03bc\u03bd is composed of two parts, i.e.\nfQT \u03bc\u03bd\u03b4R\u03bc\u03bd\n= [ 1\n2 ( fQT\u03bc\u03bd) + g\u03bc\u03bd\u2207\u03b1\u2207\u03b2( fQT \u03b1\u03b2) \u2212 \u2207\u03b1\u2207\u03bd( fQT \u03b1\u03bc )\n]\n(10)\nand\nfQ R\u03bc\u03bd\u03b4T \u03bc\u03bd\n= fQ [ \u2212G\u03bc\u03bdLm \u2212 1\n2 RT\u03bc\u03bd + 2R\u03b1\u03bcT\u03b1\u03bd \u2212 2R\u03b1\u03b2 \u03b42Lm \u03b4g\u03bc\u03bd\u03b4g\u03b1\u03b2\n] \u03b4g\u03bc\u03bd.\n(11)\nConsidering the perfect fluid as matter content, it is assumed that the Lagrangian of the matter is Lm = \u2212p. This choice implies that\n\u03b42Lm \u03b4g\u03bc\u03bd\u03b4g\u03b1\u03b2 = 0. (12)\nThen the tensor \u03bc\u03bd becomes\n\u03bc\u03bd = \u22122T\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 pg\u03bc\u03bd.

            "text": "Here the modified Einstein equations are solved considering the G\u00f6del-type metric and a perfect fluid as the content of matter. Before solving the field equations obtained in the previous section, the main characteristics of this solution are presented.\nThe G\u00f6del-type solution is described by the line element\nds2 = \u2212dt2 \u2212 2H(r)dtd\u03c6 + dr2 + ( D2(r) \u2212 H2(r) ) d\u03c62 + dz2, (16)\nwhere H(r) and D(r) are functions that satisfies the relations H \u2032(r) D(r) = 2\u03c9 and D \u2032\u2032(r) D(r) = m2. (17)\nThe prime implies the derivative with respect to r . It is important to note that\u03c9 andm2 are free parameters that characterize all properties of the metric [24,41]. This is a generalization of the solution proposed by G\u00f6del. The G\u00f6del metric is an exact solution of Einstein equations for a homogeneous rotating universe. This solution leads to the possibility of Closed Time-like Curves (CTCs) that allow violation of causality. As an immediate consequence, this makes time travel theoretically possible in this space-time. For a more detailed investigation of causality, as well as its violation, the G\u00f6deltype solution is used. From the parameters \u03c9 and m2 three different classes are defined, i.e. hyperbolic, trigonometric and linear class [24]. Here only the hyperbolic class is considered. For this class, the functions H(r) and D(r) are given as\nH(r) = 4\u03c9 m2\nsenh2 (mr\n2\n) , (18)\nD(r) = 1 m senh(mr). (19)\nAn important quantity that is calculated from G\u00f6del-type solution is the critical radius, beyond which CTCs exist. It is defined as\nrc = 2 m senh\u22121\n( 4\u03c92\nm2 \u2212 1\n)\u22121 . (20)\nFrom this, two relationships between the parameters \u03c92 and m2 are interesting. (i) m2 = 2\u03c92 that leads to the G\u00f6del\nsolution with a finite critical radius given by\nrc = 2 m senh\u22121 (1) . (21)\nAs a consequence, non-causal regions are allowed. And (ii) m2 = 4\u03c92 implies an infinite critical radius. In other words, this condition leads to a causal solution.\nFor simplicity, a new basis (a local Lorentz co-frame) is chosen, such that the metric becomes [24],\nds2 = \u03b7AB\u03b8 A\u03b8 B = (\u03b8(0))2 \u2212 (\u03b8(1))2 \u2212 (\u03b8(2))2 \u2212 (\u03b8(3))2, (22)\nwhere \u03b7AB is the Minkowski metric and \u03b8 A = eA \u03bc dx\u03bc with\n\u03b8(0) = dt + H(r)d\u03c6, \u03b8(1) = dr, \u03b8(2) = D(r)d\u03c6, \u03b8(3) = dz, (23)\nand eA \u03bc is the tetrad that satisfies the relation eA \u03bce\u03bc B = \u03b4AB . Here the capital Latin letters label Lorentz indices and run from 0 to 3.\nIn the local Lorentz co-frame (23), the non-zero Ricci tensor components are R(0)(0) = 12 ( H \u2032 D )2 , R(1)(1) = R(2)(2) = R(0)(0) \u2212 D \u2032\u2032\nD . (24)\nIt is interesting to note that all components are constants, i.e.\nR(0)(0) = 2\u03c92, R(1)(1) = R(2)(2) = 2\u03c92 \u2212 m2. (25) The non-vanishing components of the Einstein tensor in flat (local) space-time take the form,\nG(0)(0) = 3\u03c92 \u2212 m2, (26) G(1)(1) = \u03c92, (27) G(2)(2) = \u03c92, (28) G(3)(3) = m2 \u2212 \u03c92, (29)\nwhere GAB = e\u03bcAe\u03bdBG\u03bc\u03bd has been used. The Ricci scalar is R = 2(m2 \u2212 w2).\nAssuming that the content of matter is a perfect fluid, the energy\u2013momentum tensor that describes it is\nTAB = (\u03c1 + p)uAuB \u2212 p\u03b7AB, (30) with uA = (1, 0, 0, 0) being the four-velocity of fluid. Thus, in flat space-time the tensor given in Eq. (13) becomes\nAB = \u22122TAB \u2212 p\u03b7AB . (31)\nTaking the Minkowski metric as\n\u03b7AB = \u239b \u239c\u239c\u239d\n1 0 0 0 0 \u22121 0 0 0 0 \u22121 0 0 0 0 \u22121\n\u239e \u239f\u239f\u23a0 , (32)\nthe components of the tensors (30) and (31) are\nTAB = \u239b \u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u03c1 0 0 0 0 p 0 0 0 0 p 0 0 0 0 p\n\u239e \u239f\u239f\u23a0 ; AB = \u239b \u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u22122\u03c1 \u2212 p 0 0 0 0 \u2212p 0 0 0 0 \u2212p 0 0 0 0 \u2212p\n\u239e \u239f\u239f\u23a0 .\n(33)\nThe trace of TAB and AB are T = \u03c1\u22123p and = 2(p\u2212\u03c1). Using the components of the energy\u2013momentum tensor and the Ricci tensor, the components of Q = RABT AB are given as\nQ = \u239b \u239c\u239c\u239d 2\u03c92\u03c1 0 0 0 0 ( 2\u03c92 \u2212 m2) p 0 0 0 0 ( 2\u03c92 \u2212 m2) p 0\n0 0 0 0\n\u239e \u239f\u239f\u23a0 . (34)\nIt should be noted that the derivatives of the functions fR and fQ vanish since the Ricci scalar and Q are constants. Then the field equations (14) are rewritten as\nRAB fR\n= \u03ba2TAB + 1 2 \u03b7AB f \u2212 fT (TAB + AB) \u2212 AB fQ .\n(35)\nTaking the trace of this equation leads to\nR fR = \u03ba2T + 2 f \u2212 fT (T + ) \u2212 fQ, (36) where = \u03b7AB AB . Combining these equations we have fRGAB = \u03ba2TAB \u2212 fT (TAB + AB) \u2212 AB fQ\n\u22121 2 \u03b7AB\n[ f + \u03ba2T \u2212 fT (T + ) \u2212 fQ ] (37)\nwith GAB = RAB \u2212 12 R\u03b7AB being the Einstein tensor. In order to solve the set of field equations, let us explicitly write Eq. (15) in flat space-time. Then\nAB\n= \u239b \u239c\u239c\u239d \u2212(3\u03c92 \u2212 m2)p \u2212 (m2 \u2212 5\u03c92)\u03c1 0 0 0 0 ( m2 \u2212 4\u03c92) p 0 0 0 0 ( m2 \u2212 4\u03c92) p 0\n0 0 0 \u22122 (m2 \u2212 \u03c92) p\n\u239e \u239f\u239f\u23a0 . (38)\nAs a consequence = (m2 + 3\u03c92) p \u2212 (m2 \u2212 5\u03c92) \u03c1.\nUsing these results the field equations (37) become\n2 fR ( 3\u03c92 \u2212 m2 )\n+ f = \u03ba2 (\u03c1 + 3p) + fT (\u03c1 + p) + fQ [( 9\u03c92 \u2212 m2 ) p + ( m2 \u2212 5\u03c92 ) \u03c1 ] , (39)\n2 fR\u03c9 2 \u2212 f = \u03ba2 (\u03c1 \u2212 p) + fT (\u03c1 + p)\n+ fQ [( 5\u03c92 \u2212 3m2 ) p + ( m2 \u2212 5\u03c92 ) \u03c1 ] , (40)\n2 fR ( m2 \u2212 \u03c92 ) \u2212 f = \u03ba2 (\u03c1 \u2212 p) + fT (\u03c1 + p)\n+ fQ [( 3m2 \u2212 7\u03c92 ) p + ( m2 \u2212 5\u03c92 ) \u03c1 ] . (41)\nEquations (40) and (41) lead to( 2\u03c92 \u2212 m2 ) ( 2 fR \u2212 6p fQ\n) = 0. (42) Assuming fR > 0 and fQ > 0, Eq. (42) gives us\nm2 = 2\u03c92. (43) This condition defines the G\u00f6del solution, and the remaining field equations read\nm2 fR + f = \u03ba2 (\u03c1 + 3p) + fT (\u03c1 + p) + fQ (7p \u2212 3\u03c1) m 2\n2 , (44)\nm2 fR \u2212 f = \u03ba2 (\u03c1 \u2212 p) + fT (\u03c1 + p) \u2212 fQ (3p + 9\u03c1) m 2\n8 . (45)\nSince these equations allow the G\u00f6del solution, a critical radius, which defines regions where causality is violated, can be calculated. Then the critical radius in f (R, T, R\u03bc\u03bdT\u03bc\u03bd) gravity is rc = 2 sinh\u22121(1) \u221a\n2 fR \u2212 fQ16 (19p \u2212 39\u03c1) 2\u03ba2\u03c1 + f + 2 fT (\u03c1 + p) . (46)\nNote that the rc depends on the gravity theory and the content of matter. It is important to emphasize that this quantity is obtained for any f (R, T, R\u03bc\u03bdT\u03bc\u03bd) gravity. A similar result is obtained for other gravity theories such as f (R) and f (R, T ).\nIt is shown that for a perfect fluid as the content of matter non-causal G\u00f6del curves are unavoidable. From this result, a natural question arises: is there any condition that leads to a causal G\u00f6del-type solution in this gravitational theory? In the next section, such an investigation is developed."

(57)\nThis equation leads to the following set of field equations\n2 fR ( 3\u03c92 \u2212 m2) + f = \u03ba2 (\u03c1 + 3p) + fT (\u03c1 + p + 2)\n+ fQ [( 9\u03c92 \u2212 m2) p + (m2 \u2212 5\u03c92) \u03c1 \u2212 2\u03c92 2] , (58) 2 fR\u03c9 2 \u2212 f = \u03ba2 (\u03c1 \u2212 p) + fT ( \u03c1 + p \u2212 2)\n+ fQ [(\u22123m2 + 5\u03c92) p + (m2 \u2212 5\u03c92) \u03c1 + (m2 \u2212 2\u03c92) 2] ,\n(59) 2 ( m2 \u2212 \u03c92) fR \u2212 f = \u03ba2 (\u03c1 \u2212 p + 2 2) + fT (\u03c1 + p \u2212 2) + fQ [( 3m2 \u2212 7\u03c92) p + (m2 \u2212 5\u03c92) \u03c1] . (60)\nFor simplicity, after some manipulation, these equations are rewritten as \u03ba2 2 = ( m2 \u2212 2\u03c92 ) fR\n+ fQ [ \u22123p ( m2 \u2212 \u03c92 ) + 2\n2\n( m2 \u2212 2\u03c92 )] , (61)\n\u03ba2 p + 1 2 fT 2 = 1 2\n( 2\u03c92 \u2212 m2 ) fR\n+1 2 f + fQ 4\n[ m2 2 \u2212 ( 4\u03c92 + 2m2 ) p ] , (62)\n\u03ba2\u03c1 + fT ( \u03c1 + p \u2212 2\n2\n) = 1\n2\n( 6\u03c92 \u2212 m2 ) fR\n\u22121 2 f + fQ\n[ 2 ( 5\u03c92 \u2212 2m2 ) p \u2212 2\n2\n( m2 + 2\u03c92 )] .\n(63)\nAssuming that these equations satisfy the conditions fR > 0, fT > 0 and fQ > 0 implies that the set of equations satisfy a causal solution, i.e.\nm2 = 4\u03c92. (64) As a consequence of Eq. (64) the critical radius goes to infinity, i.e. rc \u2192 \u221e. Therefore, for this combination of perfect fluid and scalar field as matter content, a causal G\u00f6del-type solution is allowed in f (R, T, R\u03bc\u03bdT\u03bc\u03bd) gravity. In addition, due to the consistency of the equations, a relationship between the constant associated with the scalar field and the pressure p of the perfect fluid is required.\nIt is important to say that by making fQ go to zero in the field equations, the results already obtained for the f (R, T ) theory are recovered. This reinforces the principle of correspondence between theories."

            "text": "In this paper, f (R, T, R\u03bc\u03bdT\u03bc\u03bd) gravity is considered and the causality violation is investigated using the G\u00f6del-type metric. It was shown that this theory generalizes GR implying a geometry-matter coupling. An important question that must be answered by all modified theories is: does the new theory contain all solutions of the GR? In order to answer this question, this work investigated whether an exact solution of GR, such as G\u00f6del metric or G\u00f6del-type metric, holds in f (R, T, R\u03bc\u03bdT\u03bc\u03bd) gravity.\nConsidering the hyperbolic class of G\u00f6del-type solution and the perfect fluid as matter content, the non-causal G\u00f6del solution is obtained. From this, a finite critical radius is calculated that leads to the possible existence of CTCs. In this case, the critical radius is a function that depends on the function f (R, T, R\u03bc\u03bdT\u03bc\u03bd) and the derivatives of its variables, fR , fT and fQ . To investigate causal solutions in this gravitational theory, different content of matter is considered, i.e., a combination between perfect fluid and scalar field. With these considerations, a condition emerges from the set of field equations that implies an infinite critical radius. Thus, the violation of causality is avoided in this theory. Furthermore, the result presented here is a generalization of the results obtained for f (R) and f (R, T ) gravities. However, a different condition arises for the causal solution in f (R, T, R\u03bc\u03bdT\u03bc\u03bd) gravity, namely, there is a certain connection between the contents of matter, i.e., the perfect fluid pressure and the scalar field are related.\nAcknowledgements This work by A.
