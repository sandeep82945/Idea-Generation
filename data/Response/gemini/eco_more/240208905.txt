1. **Investigate the impact of different types of social norms on time preference and inequality.** The study only considers a single type of social norm, which is a norm against waste. However, there are many other types of social norms that could potentially affect time preference, such as norms about saving, spending, and borrowing. It would be interesting to explore how these different types of social norms interact with each other and how they affect inequality.
2. **Examine the role of social networks in the transmission of time preferences.** The study assumes that individuals interact with each other randomly. However, in reality, individuals are more likely to interact with people who are similar to them in terms of their social and economic status. This could lead to the formation of social networks in which certain time preferences are more common than others. It would be interesting to investigate how social networks affect the transmission of time preferences and how this, in turn, affects inequality.
3. **Develop a more sophisticated model of time preference that incorporates multiple psychological motivations and factors.** The study's model of time preference is relatively simple and does not take into account the full range of psychological motivations and factors that can affect time preference. For example, the model does not consider the role of emotions, such as fear and greed, or the role of cognitive biases, such as the present bias. It would be interesting to develop a more sophisticated model of time preference that incorporates these factors and to explore how this affects the results of the study.
4. **Extend the model to include other types of economic interactions.** The study only considers the impact of time preference on capital and consumption. However, there are many other types of economic interactions that could potentially be affected by time preference, such as saving, spending, borrowing, and lending. It would be interesting to extend the model to include these other types of economic interactions and to explore how this affects the results of the study.
5. **Test the model using empirical data.** The study's results are based on a theoretical model. It would be interesting to test the model using empirical data to see if the results hold up in the real world. This could be done by collecting data on time preference, capital, consumption, and inequality and then using statistical methods to test the relationship between these variables.
