Based on the provided text, the sentences/portion of text where future research direction is mentioned are not explicitly stated. The text primarily focuses on the methodology, findings, and implications of the current study on protein adsorption by polymerized surfaces using a coarse-grained model. It discusses the significance of various factors such as polymer grafting density, protein size, and hydrophobicity ratio on adsorption efficiency, as well as the roles of ligands and attractive tethering surfaces. However, specific statements regarding future research directions, such as plans for further studies, areas that require more investigation, or suggestions for future research topics, are not directly quoted in the provided text. 

For future research directions, typically, one would look for phrases like "future studies should investigate," "further research is needed to," or "the next steps include," among others. If such phrases are present in sections not included in the provided text, I recommend focusing on the conclusion or discussion sections of the paper, as these areas often contain recommendations for future research based on the current study's findings.
