    "abstractText": "Cancer is a collection of diseases in which cells separate without mechanism or order. The over-division of cells affects information recognized as a tumor. Not every tumor is considered cancer. To be identified as cancer, a tumor must damage neighboring muscles or tissues. International collaboration on cancer reporting (ICCR) information organization has been utilized to give a dominant, indication-based technique for the converging of carcinoma. The influence guarantees that the information organizations given for distinct tumor sorts have a dominant rule and style and includes all the parameters required to guide administration and prediction for separate cancers. This manuscript aims to expose certain new and valuable ideas with the help of bipolar complex fuzzy (BCF) information and power aggregation operators and evaluated their influential and dominant results and properties. Additionally, finding the most deadly and awkward sort of cancer in the world is very complicated. The main theme of the diagnosed operators is to evaluate the problem related to finding the deadliest type of cancer in human beings and try to compare the final result with the certain prevailing result to enhance the worth of the evaluated approaches INDEX TERMS Bipolar complex fuzzy information, Power Averaging/geometric aggregation operators, Classification of cancer diseases.",

Many intellectuals have analyzed the different forms of cancer using classical information and found a feasible and suitable solution. For analyzing the solution to cancer in the human body, every expert or doctor has needed to collect genuine data from many hospitals which is very complex work. But one of the most important and valuable questions, if we find the solution for the cancer patient by using fuzzy set theory instead of classical information is very complicated because for this it is necessary to develop someone the idea of fuzzy sets theory. Such sort of problem was faced by Zadeh and in 1965, Zadeh [1] invented the valuable idea of the fuzzy set (FS) by extending the {0, 1} \u201crange of classical set\u201d into [0, 1] \u201crange of FS theory\u201d. Fuzzy logic is a valuable approach to variable evaluation that permits many possible supporting values to be evaluated through the same variable. Information cannot handle from the classical set; the theory of fuzzy set can easily evaluate them. Ohlan and Ohlan [2] investigated a bibliometric overview of FS and Abdullah et al. [3] discussed a fractional fuzzy decision-theoretical rough set. FS theory has been feasibly integrated into certain decision-making techniques to manage ambiguity and vague information [4, 5]. Various researchers worked in the modified structures of FS theory such as Yang et al. [6] discussed belief and plausibility measures on intuitionistic FS and developed the belief-plausibility TOPSIS approach, and Abid et al. [7] investigated similarity measures under the setting of Tspherical FS. However, the modeling techniques of FSs are restricted to evaluating ambiguity and awkward data in which two or massive information of ambiguity occurred continuously on two different sides. Bipolar FS (BFS) [8] gives a valuable definition of ambiguity and therefore permits experts to resolve it in a broader field because of the ambiguities that occurred in the dilemmas evaluated and the deficiencies of the decision-making procedure. The BFS has positive and negative supporting grades, where the value of the positive supporting grade is belonging to [0, 1] and the value of the negative supporting grade is contained in [-1, 0]. In this scenario, BFSs include massive data than FSs, which have more value. Certain scholars introduced various structures in the environment of BFS, like Jana et al. [9], Jana et al. [10], Yager and Rybalov [11], and Mesiar et al. [12] investigated various AOs for BFS, Jana [13] propounded MABAC approach for extending BFS, Singh [14] investigated bipolar fuzzy (BF) attribute implications, and Guterrez et al. [15] introduced BF measures. Also, certain scholars generalized the theory of BFS such as Naz et al. [16] described 2-tuple linguistic BF, Liu et al. [17] defined bipolar hesitant fuzzy linguistic, Mandal [18], propounded bipolar Pythagorean FS, Riaz and Tehrim [19] investigated geometric AOs for cubic BFS (CBFS), Riaz et al. [20] studied Einstein averaging AOs for CBFS. Mahmood [21] established a T-bipolar soft set (SS), Riaz and Tehrim [22]\ninvestigated CBFS and also Riaz and Tehrim [23] gave DM approach for CBFS.\nThe existing information explained above has certain limitations because the function contained in BFS managed with one-dimension information. None of these techniques are suitable to express the phase term and because of these issues, experts have lost a lot of data during the decisionmaking procedure. A well-known organization has done research on biometric information in many places and the researchers have decided to update the data time by time (periodicity). To engage periodic terms in the term of supporting grade, the theory of complex FS (CFS) was diagnosed by Ramot et al. [24]. After successfully constructing the theory of CFS, certain people have engaged in the field of certain circumstances such as Mahmood et al. [25] discussed the interdependency of the complex fuzzy neighborhood, Lui et al. [26] and Bi et al. [27] propounded entropy measures for CFS, and Dai et al. [28] and Song et al. [29] presented distance measures among interval-valued CFS, Alolaivan et al. [30] investigated complex fuzzy (CF) subgroups, and Ahsan et al. [31] introduced CF hypersoft mapping. Yang et al [32] deduced partitioned Bonferroni mean operators in the setting of complex q-rung orthopair uncertain linguistic set. However, the modeling techniques of CFSs are restricted to evaluating ambiguity and awkward data in which two or massive information of ambiguity occurred continuously on two different sides. Bipolar CFS (BCFS) [33] gives a valuable definition of ambiguity and therefore permits experts to resolve it in a broader field because of the ambiguities that occurred in the dilemmas evaluated and the deficiencies of the decision-making procedure. The BCFS has positive and negative supporting grades, where the real and imaginary values of positive supporting grades is belonging to [0, 1] and the real and imaginary values of negative supporting grades are contained in [-1, 0]. In this scenario, BCFSs include massive data than FSs, CFSs, and BFS, which have value and consideration by certain scholars. We can describe that the BCFS is a valuable and appropriate tool for genuine decision-making requests [34, 35].\nIn many cases, certain doctors have noticed that many types of cancer have no particular symptoms, based on the usefulness and feasibility of genuine cancer screening, as well as risk feature minimization (\u201cmeans that the ratio of death is increasing or decreasing\u201d). To facilitate the cancer patient, every doctor has to follow the following procedure, first, they have found the stage of cancer, which means that the concerned doctor has evaluated the size, location, and behavior of the cancer, then based on the above analysis doctor has suggested the treatment of cancer.

APPLICATION \u201cCLASSIFICATION OF CANCER DISEASES IN HUMAN BODY USING HYBRID\nAPPROACHES BASED ON BIPOLAR COMPLEX\nFUZZY INFORMATION\u201d ICCR information organizations have been utilized to give a dominant, indication-based technique for the converging of carcinoma. The influence guarantees that the information organizations given for distinct tumor sorts have a dominant rule and style and include all the parameters required to guide administration and prediction for separate cancers. Cancer indicates any one of a finite number of diseases described by the growth of unusual cells that separate unmanageable and can penetrate and damage typical physique tissue. The death rate of cancer in human beings is the second number but due to our valuable and intelligent doctors, nowadays the ratio of the death cases in cancer has reduced. Cancer-affected peoples have a lot of symptoms and all cancer symptoms differ on the sort and the stage of the cancer growth and also depend on the patient's overall health. In many cases, certain doctors have noticed that many types of cancer have no particular symptoms, based on the usefulness and feasibility of genuine cancer screening, as well as risk feature minimization (\u201cmeans that the ratio of death is increasing or decreasing\u201d). To facilitate the cancer patient, every doctor has followed the following procedure, first, they have found the stage of cancer, which means that the concerned doctor has to evaluate the size, location, and behavior of the cancer, then based on the above analysis doctor has suggested the treatment of cancer. Different types of cancer have needed\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

Most people have affected because of non-stop smoking addiction, eating an unhealthy diet, working in front of the sun and harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun can increase the risk of skin cancer, not doing exercise, increasing/decreasing weights without any diet, drinking alcohol, not properly checkup of cancer, etc. The main symptoms in a cancer patient are the form like pain, fatigue, a complication in breathing, nausea, informal weight loss, brain dilemma, chemical changes in the skin, etc. In this theory, we focused on the main four types of cancer and try to evaluate the most critical type in all of them. Further, we recalled the theory of BCF information and their related theory and power aggregation operator. Cancer is an awkward and complex collection of diseases for certain possible reasons. Many intellectuals have analyzed the different forms of cancer using classical information and found a feasible and suitable solution. For analyzing the solution to cancer in the human body, every expert or doctor has needed to collect genuine data from many hospitals which is very complex work. But one of the most important and valuable questions, if we find the solution for the cancer patient by using fuzzy set theory instead of classical information is very complicated because for this it is necessary to develop someone the idea of fuzzy sets theory. Cancer is a collection of diseases in which cells separate without mechanism or order. The over-division of cells affects information recognized as a tumor. Not every tumor is considered cancerous. To be identified as cancer, a tumor must damage neighboring muscles or tissues. A. Decision-Making Procedure\nAssume a collection of alternatives \u010e = {\u010e1, \u010e2, \u2026 , \u010e\ud835\udc5a} and their attributes \ud835\udd1b = {\ud835\udd1b1, \ud835\udd1b2, \u2026 , \ud835\udd1b\ud835\udc5b} with weight vectors \u2211 \u2111\u01f0 = 1 \ud835\udc5b \u01f0=1 , where \u2111 = {\u21111, \u21112, \u2026 , \u2111\ud835\udc5b} \ud835\udc47 and \u2111\ud835\udc57, \ud835\udc57 = 1,2, \u2026 , \ud835\udc5b \u2208 [0,1]. To find the most deadly and awkward sort of cancer in the world is very complicated. The main theme of the diagnosed operators is to evaluate the problem related to finding the deadliest type of cancer (\u201cusing four important types of cancer and their related four useful and initial symptoms\u201d) in human beings and try to compare the final result with the certain prevailing result is to enhance the worth of the evaluated approaches. For this, we computed\nthe matrix which includes the BCFNs \u010e =\n(\u212b\ud835\udc43\u2212\u010e(\u2113), \u212b\ud835\udc41\u2212\u010e(\u2113)) = (\u212b\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc43\u2212\u010e(\u2113) +\n\ud835\udf04\u212b\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc43\u2212\u010e(\u2113), \u212b\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc41\u2212\u010e(\u2113) + \ud835\udf04 \u212b\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc41\u2212\u010e(\u2113)), expressed the BCF set\nwith positive and negative supporting grade \u212b\ud835\udc43\u2212\u010e(\u2113) = \u212b\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc43\u2212\u010e(\u2113) + \ud835\udf04 \u212b\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc43\u2212\u010e(\u2113) and \u212b\ud835\udc41\u2212\u010e(\u2113) = \u212b\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc41\u2212\u010e(\u2113) + \ud835\udf04 \u212b\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc41\u2212\u010e(\u2113) with \u212b\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc43\u2212\u010e(\u2113), \u212b\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc43\u2212\u010e(\u2113) \u2208 [0, 1] and\n\u212b\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc41\u2212\u010e(\u2113), \u212b\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc41\u2212\u010e(\u2113) \u2208 [\u22121, 0]. Then, we organized the following procedure for decision-making, such that Stage 1: We summarized the BCF information in the shape of a matrix, where the BCF information is represented by:\n\u010e = (\u212b\ud835\udc43\u2212\u010e(\u2113), \u212b\ud835\udc41\u2212\u010e(\u2113)) = (\u212b\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc43\u2212\u010e(\u2113) +\n\ud835\udf04\u212b\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc43\u2212\u010e(\u2113), \u212b\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc41\u2212\u010e(\u2113) + \ud835\udf04 \u212b\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc41\u2212\u010e(\u2113)).\nStage 2: Aggregate the information given in the matrix, using the theory of BCFPA, BCFPWA, BCFPOWA, BCFPG, BCFPWG, and BCFPOWG operators. Stage 3: Compute the score value of the obtained information, if the score value failed, use the accuracy value. Stage 4: Rank all alternatives and find the better decision. B. Illustrated Example Different types of cancer have needed different types of treatment, and most doctors have used the following strategy for the treatment of cancer patients chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation therapy. Certain cancer patients have used different therapies for their treatment. Most people have affected because of non-stop smoking addiction, eating an unhealthy diet, working in front of the sun and harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun can increase the risk of skin cancer, not doing exercise, increasing/decreasing weights without any diet, drinking alcohol, not properly checkup of cancer, etc. The main symptoms in a cancer patient are the form like pain, fatigue, a complication in breathing, nausea, informal weight loss, brain dilemma, chemical changes in the skin, etc. In this theory, we focused on the main four types of cancer and try to evaluate the most critical type in all of them. Here we consider four main and important types of cancer represented in the shape of alternatives, whose brief information is explained below: \u010e1: Bladder cancer. \u010e2: Breast cancer. \u010e3: Colorectal cancer. \u010e4: Kidney cancer. For every type of cancer, we used four symptoms in the shape of the attribute, such that \ud835\udd1b1: Smoking Addiction. \ud835\udd1b2: Drinking Alcohol. \ud835\udd1b3: Genetic Mutations. \ud835\udd1b4: Exposure to many Chemicals. Then by using invented algorithms, we diagnosed the beneficial decision with \u2137 = (0.24, 0.26, 0,15, 0.35), representing the weight vector. Then, we organized the following procedure for decision-making, such that Stage 1: We summarized the BCF information in the shape of a matrix, where the BCF information is represented by:\n\u010e = (\u212b\ud835\udc43\u2212\u010e(\u2113), \u212b\ud835\udc41\u2212\u010e(\u2113)) = (\u212b\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc43\u2212\u010e(\u2113) +\n\ud835\udf04\u212b\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc43\u2212\u010e(\u2113), \u212b\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc41\u2212\u010e(\u2113) + \ud835\udf04 \u212b\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc41\u2212\u010e(\u2113)), see Table 1.\nAuthor Name: Preparation of Papers for IEEE Access (February 2017)\n\u010e\ud835\udfcf ( 0. 41 + \ud835\udf04 0.61, \u22120.42 \u2212 \ud835\udf04 0.62 ) ( 0. 82 + \ud835\udf04 0.53, \u22120.84 \u2212 \ud835\udf04 0.51 ) ( 0.31 + \ud835\udf04 0.11, \u22120.32 \u2212 \ud835\udf04 0.12 ) ( 0.75 + \ud835\udf04 0.36, \u22120.1 \u2212 \ud835\udf04 0.17 ) \u010e\ud835\udfd0 ( 0.43 + \ud835\udf04 0.63, \u22120.44 \u2212 \ud835\udf04 0.64 ) ( 0. 86 + \ud835\udf04 0.57, \u22120.88 \u2212 \ud835\udf04 059. ) ( 0. 33 + \ud835\udf04 0.13, \u22120.34 \u2212 \ud835\udf04 0.14 ) ( 0. 6 + \ud835\udf04 0.3, \u22120.8 \u2212 \ud835\udf04 0.7 ) \u010e\ud835\udfd1 ( 0. 45 + \ud835\udf04 0.65, \u22120.46 \u2212 \ud835\udf04 0.66 ) ( 0.81 + \ud835\udf04 0.58, \u22120.83 \u2212 \ud835\udf04 0.56 ) ( 0. 35 + \ud835\udf04 0.15, \u22120.36 \u2212 \ud835\udf04 0.16 ) ( 0. 5 + \ud835\udf04 0.25, \u22120.9 \u2212 \ud835\udf04 0.17 ) \u010e\ud835\udfd2 ( 0. 47 + \ud835\udf04 0.67, \u22120.48 \u2212 \ud835\udf04 0.68 ) ( 0.85 + \ud835\udf04 0.54, \u22120.89 \u2212 \ud835\udf04 0.52 ) ( 0. 37 + \ud835\udf04 0.17, \u22120.38 \u2212 \ud835\udf04 0.18 ) ( 0.25 + \ud835\udf04 0.67, \u22120.5 \u2212 \ud835\udf04 0.42 )\nStage 2: Aggregate the information given in a matrix, using the theory of BCFPA, BCFPWA, BCFPOWA, BCFPG,\nBCFPWG, and BCFPOWG operators, and using distance measures investigated by Mahmood and Ur Rehman [29],\nsee Table 2.\nStage 3: Compute the score value of the obtained information, if the score value is failed, use the accuracy\nvalue, see Table 3.\nStage 4: Rank all alternatives and find the better decision,\nsee Table 4.\nAuthor Name: Preparation of Papers for IEEE Access (February 2017)\nVOLUME XX, 2017 3\nWe learned from the well-known research, we noticed that in 2021, the most viral and affected type of cancer is called bladder cancer.

The main theme of the diagnosed operators is to evaluate the problem related to finding the deadliest type of cancer (\u201cusing four important types of cancer and their related four useful and initial symptoms\u201d) in human beings and try to compare the final result with the certain prevailing result is to enhance the worth of the evaluated approaches. In this scenario, BCFSs\ninclude massive data than FSs, CFSs, and BFS, which have value and consideration by certain scholars. We can describe that the BCFS is a valuable and appropriate tool for genuine decision-making requests. For comparison, we used the Power AOs (PAOs) for intuitionistic fuzzy information diagnosed by Xu [42], Dombi prioritized AOs diagnosed by Jana et al. [43], and PAOs for complex fuzzy information investigated by Hu et al. [44], geometric AOs for cubic BFS invented by Riaz and Tehrim [19], Einstein averaging AOs for cubic BFS diagnosed by Riaz et al. [20], Hamacher aggregation operators for BCF information diagnosed by Mahmood et al. [34], and Dombi aggregation operators using the BCF information invented by Mahmood and Ur Rehman [35] and diagnosed operators. We applied the existing and investigated operators and methods to the information described in Table 1. The comparative analysis is mentioned in Table 5.\nTable 5 provides that the information in Table 1 is beyond the ability of the operators and methods diagnosed by Xu [42], Jana et al. [43], Hu et al. [44], Riaz and Tehrim [19], and Riaz et al. [20] as the information of Table 1, is in the model twodimensional information with both poles and these abovementioned theories can\u2019t cope with two-dimensional\ninformation along with both poles (positive and negative). Further, the operators and methods diagnosed by Mahmood et al. [34] and Mahmood and Ur Rehman [35] are in the structure of BCFS. Thus, they can solve the information in Table 1 and the outcome along with ranking order is described in Table 5. Table 5 provides three different types of results in the shape of \u010e1, \u010e2 and \u010e3, but most operators gave their results in the shape of \u010e1, represented bladder cancer.\nThe theories invented by Riaz and Tehrim [19], and Riaz et al. [20] are in the model of cubic BFS, this means that these theories are merely capable of handling the information with both poles or sides and can\u2019t handle the 2nd dimension.\nMoreover, the theories invented by Mahmood et al. [34] and Mahmood and ur Rehman [35], can tackle the information under BCFS but in these theories, the weight of the attributes is provided by the decision expert or analyst by his/her own choice and which can be biased. However, in the invented operators, the weight is determined through proper formula by considering the importance of attributes. Also, the invented operators cope with both pole and 2nd dimension at a time. Therefore, the diagnosed operators have massive dominance and benefits over the mentioned prevailing theories."

Thus, the main aim of this article was to study cancer diseases in the human body with the help of power AOs in the setting of BCFS. Further, we exposed the BCFPA, BCFPWA, BCFPOWA, and BCFPHA operators and evaluated their influential and dominant results and properties (\u201cidempotency, boundedness, and monotonicity\u201d) and diagnosed the BCFPG, BCFPWG, BCFPOWG, and BCFPHG operators and evaluated their influential and dominant results and properties (\u201cidempotency, boundedness, and monotonicity\u201d). After that, we found the most deadly and awkward sort of cancer in the world is very complicated. The main theme of the diagnosed operators is to evaluate the problem related to finding the deadliest type of cancer (\u201cusing four important types of cancer and their related four useful and initial symptoms\u201d) in human beings. After applying the initiated method based on the diagnosed operators, we obtained that \u010e1 that is, bladder cancer is the most viral and affected type of cancer. Finally, we compared the final result with the certain prevailing result to enhance the worth of the evaluated approaches and portrayed the advantages and supremacy of the diagnosed work.\nIn the future, our goal is to expand our presented work in various domains like hesitant fuzzy linguistics [45] and aggregation operators [46, 47]."
