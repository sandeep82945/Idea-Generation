1. **Investigate the effect of different types of fly ash on CO2 adsorption capacity.** The current study only used one type of fly ash, but there are many different types of fly ash available, each with its own unique composition and properties. It would be interesting to see how the CO2 adsorption capacity of amine-infused hydrogels is affected by the type of fly ash used.


2. **Explore the use of different amine solutions for CO2 capture.** The current study used monoethanolamine (MEA) as the amine solution, but there are many other amine solutions that could be used for CO2 capture. It would be interesting to see how the CO2 adsorption capacity of amine-infused hydrogels is affected by the type of amine solution used.


3. **Study the effect of different operating conditions on CO2 adsorption capacity.** The current study only investigated the effect of temperature on CO2 adsorption capacity, but there are many other operating conditions that could be varied, such as pressure, flow rate, and contact time. It would be interesting to see how the CO2 adsorption capacity of amine-infused hydrogels is affected by these operating conditions.


4. **Investigate the long-term stability of amine-infused hydrogels.** The current study only looked at the short-term stability of amine-infused hydrogels, but it is important to know how these materials will perform over the long term. It would be interesting to see how the CO2 adsorption capacity of amine-infused hydrogels changes over time, and to identify any factors that affect their stability.


5. **Explore the potential applications of amine-infused hydrogels for CO2 capture.** The current study only looked at the potential of amine-infused hydrogels for CO2 capture in the laboratory, but it is important to know how these materials will perform in real-world applications. It would be interesting to see how amine-infused hydrogels can be used to capture CO2 from flue gas, and to identify any challenges that need to be overcome in order to make this technology commercially viable.
