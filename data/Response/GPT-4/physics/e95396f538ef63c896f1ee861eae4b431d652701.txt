Optimization of Oxidant Precursor Concentrations for Enhanced Degradation Efficiency: Future research could focus on determining the optimal concentrations of H2O2 and S2O8^2- to maximize the degradation efficiency of pharmaceutical compounds in different types of effluents. This includes exploring the balance between cost-efficiency and degradation performance, taking into account the diminishing returns on increasing oxidant concentrations and the potential adverse effects of excessive oxidant use.

Investigation of Other Pharmaceutical Compounds and Mixtures: While this study focused on ibuprofen, naproxen, and diclofenac, future work could explore a broader range of pharmaceuticals, especially those known to be persistent in the environment. This would involve assessing the degradation efficiencies of different classes of drugs, including antibiotics and hormones, under UVC/H2O2 and UVC/S2O8^2- treatments, to better understand the versatility and limitations of these advanced oxidation processes (AOPs).

Long-term Impact Study on Aquatic Ecosystems: Given that pharmaceutical compounds and their degradation products can have ecotoxicological effects, research is needed to assess the long-term impacts of treated effluents on aquatic ecosystems. This would include studying the degradation pathways and the toxicity of by-products formed during the AOPs to ensure that the treatment processes do not inadvertently harm aquatic life.

Scaling Up and Real-world Application: This study was conducted on a laboratory pilot scale. Future research could focus on scaling up the treatment processes to industrial or municipal scales. This would involve evaluating the technical and economic feasibilities, including the design of large-scale reactors, integration with existing wastewater treatment facilities, and long-term operational costs. Studies could also assess the effectiveness of these AOPs across different geographical locations and seasonal variations in effluent compositions.

Development of Hybrid or Sequential Treatment Processes: Exploring the combination of UVC/H2O2 and UVC/S2O8^2- treatments with other wastewater treatment methods, such as biological processes, filtration, or adsorption, could offer synergistic effects for improved removal of micropollutants. Research could investigate the most effective sequences or combinations of treatment processes to achieve higher degradation efficiencies, lower energy consumption, and reduced costs, especially for effluents with high organic loads or complex pollution profiles.
