1. **Investigate the effects of different catalyst supports on the activity and durability of Pt/SiO2 catalysts for oxalic acid degradation.** This could help to identify more efficient and stable catalysts for this reaction.
2. **Explore the use of other noble metals, such as Pd or Ru, as catalysts for oxalic acid degradation.** This could lead to the development of catalysts with even higher activity and durability than Pt/SiO2.
3. **Study the effects of different reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and pH, on the rate and selectivity of oxalic acid degradation.** This information could be used to optimize the reaction conditions for this process.
4. **Investigate the use of oxalic acid degradation as a method for the removal of organic pollutants from wastewater.** This could be a promising new application for this technology.
5. **Develop a theoretical model for the reaction mechanism of oxalic acid degradation with Pt/SiO2 catalysts.** This model could help to provide a better understanding of the reaction process and to identify ways to improve the efficiency and selectivity of the reaction.
