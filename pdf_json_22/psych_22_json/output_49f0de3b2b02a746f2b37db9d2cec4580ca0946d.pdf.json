ABSTRACT Introduction Globally, the COVID19 pandemic has significantly disrupted the provision of healthcare and efficiency of healthcare systems and is likely to have profound implications for pregnant and postpartum women and their families including those who experience the tragedy of stillbirth or neonatal death. This study aims to understand the psychosocial impact of COVID19 and the experiences of parents who have accessed maternity, neonatal and bereavement care services during this time. Methods and analysis An international, crosssectional, online and/or telephonebased/facetoface survey is being administered across 15 countries and available in 11 languages. New, expectant and bereaved parents during the COVID19 pandemic will be recruited. Validated psychometric scales will be used to measure psychosocial wellbeing. Data will be analysed descriptively and by assessing multivariable associations of the outcomes with explanatory factors. In seven of these countries, bereaved parents will be recruited to a nested, qualitative interview study. The data will be analysed using a grounded theory analysis (for each country) and thematic framework analysis (for intercountry comparison) to gain further insights into their experiences. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval for the multicountry online survey, COCOON, has been granted by the Mater Misericordiae Human Research Ethics Committee in Australia (reference number: AM/ MML/63526). Ethics approval for the nested qualitative interview study, PUDDLES, has been granted by the King\u2019s College London Biomedical & Health Sciences, Dentistry, Medicine and Natural & Mathematical Sciences Research Ethics Subcommittee (reference number: HR19/2019455) in the UK. Local ethics committee approvals were granted in participating countries where required. Results of the study will be published in international peerreviewed journals and through parent support organisations. Findings will contribute to our understanding of delivering maternity care services, particularly bereavement care, in highincome, lower middleincome and lowincome countries during this or future health crises.",

It is particularly important to understand bereaved parent experiences of care during this time, and the extent to which recommended perinatal bereavement care practices\u2014which are known to vary widely between countries even in non- pandemic times\u2014are being provided.24 26"

The online survey is coordinated and managed by the Centre of Research Excellence in Stillbirth (Stillbirth CRE) based in Brisbane, Australia. Several countries have delivered the online survey items via a face- to- face or telephone interview, depending on local social distancing restrictions and safety, each managed by the country coordinating centre (see table 1). Ethics approval for this research project (reference number: AM/MML/63526) has been granted by the Mater Misericordiae Human Research Ethics Committee in Australia and all processes within this study are compliant with Australia\u2019s National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research and reflect international guidance on ethical principles, with country- specific ethics and governance approval gained, where required."

The study design and development of the core set of items for each survey was driven by the Stillbirth CRE in partnership with the COCOON working group and the following coordinating centres (in alphabetical order): Canada (FdM), Ireland (MM, KO\u2019D), Italy (CR, AV), Spain (JC), UK (SAS, JS) and the International Stillbirth Alliance (SHL, CS, PQ). This study was informed by previous research conducted by investigators including the COVID- ASSESS study investigating anxiety and stress in pregnant and postpartum women in Italy during the pandemic27 and international stillbirth studies published in the 2011 and 2016 The Lancet stillbirth series.20 21 28 The final core set of items for each survey ranged from approximately 70 to 115 open- ended and closed- ended questions across four main sections (see table 2). Closedended questions were included to minimise respondent time burden, while inviting extended feedback through open- ended comment response options. Validated psychometric scales were included to explore psychosocial outcomes.\nAll country coordinating centres which joined the COCOON collaboration reviewed the core set of survey items for each survey before minor contextual changes were made around terminology (eg, health practitioner terms) and translated into local languages. All study information (including consent) and survey items were translated from English to the local language (including independent review for accuracy) by each country coordinating centre. Where validated translations of psychometric scales were not available, these scales were translated from English by each country coordinating team. In addition to the core set of survey items and psychometric scales, each country coordinating centre was able to include additional survey items relevant to understanding the impact of the pandemic in their country and will be reported separately."

For the purposes of this study, the COVID- 19 pandemic is defined as starting from 30 January 2020 onwards when it was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the WHO.29 Men and women whose partner was pregnant or gave birth to their baby during the COVID- 19 pandemic, or those who suffered a stillbirth or neonatal death (referred to hereafter as \u2018partners\u2019), will also be recruited.\nFor the bereavement surveys, country- specific changes were made to the definition of stillbirth in accordance with differing gestational age criteria in each country\n(eg, in Australia stillbirth is defined as a baby dying before birth and of at least 20 weeks\u2019 gestation30; UK is of at least 24 weeks\u2019 gestation31; Brazil is of at least 22 weeks\u2019 gestation32; India is of at least 28 weeks\u2019 gestation).33 Additional inclusion criteria include participants providing informed consent online and reliable access to a computer (or similar device) and internet to complete the online survey (for countries using this mode of survey delivery). For participants who reside in countries where computer and internet access is limited, additional inclusion criteria include willingness to attend a face- toface meeting or participate in a telephone interview to complete the survey items.\nExclusion criteria For the bereavement surveys, parents who experienced the death of their baby prior to the definition of stillbirth in each country, or after the definition of neonatal death in each country, will be excluded and redirected to country- specific support services. (For the UK, women and partners who experienced a late- term miscarriage and who are therefore not eligible to participate in the COCOON online survey will able to take part in the nested qualitative study (PUDDLES)."

Participants will be predominantly recruited via online advertising including social media and other electronic communication tools (eg, newsletters) through each coordinating centre, parent support organisation partnerships and both local and national charities in each country, and the International Stillbirth Alliance member network. For those countries conducting face- to- face/telephone interviews instead of the online survey (India, Laos, The Philippines), recruitment will occur through word of mouth (eg, obstetricians, midwives), referral by practitioners/ service providers in local service settings and advocate groups (snowball sampling). Each COCOON coordinating centre has in- country partnerships with parent organisations, maternal healthcare services and parent bereavement organisations (see online supplemental appendix 1). From each participating country, we aim to recruit a minimum sample of 500 women and partners during pregnancy, 500 women and partners during the postpartum period and 200 bereaved parents following a stillbirth or neonatal death.\nProcedures Parents interested in participating access the online survey via the Stillbirth CRE website which is delivered in seven languages (except French, Hindi, Telugu and Lao;\n(IIT P atna).

The primary outcome variables for each group will be presented primarily using descriptive statistics and expressed in terms of frequencies, averages and proportions. Secondary outcome variables measuring psychosocial well- being will be expressed primarily in terms of average scale scores, and categorised (eg, high, medium, low, etc) based on recommended cut- offs (if relevant). Other secondary outcomes will be presented descriptively in terms of frequencies and proportions. Comparisons of responses between countries will be undertaken subject to sufficient numbers in each country. Comparison of responses by sociodemographic groupings such as geographical location (eg, urban, rural, remote) and location of birth (eg, public vs private hospital vs home birth) will also be undertaken, subject to sufficient numbers in each. Univariable associations will be assessed using t- tests, analysis of variance, \u03c72 test or Fisher\u2019s exact test. Inferential analyses of explanatory factors influencing the outcome variables will be carried out via multivariable linear and logistic regression. Mixedeffects models will be used to account for clustering by country when evaluating the association between potential explanatory factors other than country on outcomes. To account for variation in COVID- 19 severity in each country, we will calculate and explore in multivariable models a stringency index for each participant based on country and survey completion date using the Oxford Coronavirus Government Response Tracker data set available online (https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus) and provide a COVID- 19: Stringency Index.73\nNested qualitative interview study Methods Several COCOON country coordinating centres are also participating in an international, nested, qualitative\n(IIT P atna).

This study is titled \u2018The experiences of Parents who sUffer pregnancy loss and whose babies died During the panDemic: A quaLitative study of latE- term miscarriage, Stillbirth and neonatal death\u2019 (PUDDLES). The aim is to further explore the experiences of bereaved parents following a late- term miscarriage, stillbirth or neonatal death during the COVID- 19 pandemic. Ethics approval for the PUDDLES study has been granted by the King\u2019s College London Biomedical & Health Sciences, Dentistry, Medicine and Natural & Mathematical Sciences Research Ethics Subcommittee (reference number: HR- 19/20- 19455) in the UK, and local ethics committees in participating countries where required. COCOON survey respondents who experienced a bereavement will be invited to participate in this nested qualitative study by leaving their contact details at the end of the screen- out page. This nested study will be conducted in seven of the countries participating in the COCOON Global Collaboration and this group is known as the PUDDLES Global Collaboration, and is led by investigators at King\u2019s College London, UK (see table 1). As part of this nested qualitative study, a knowledge mapping exercise will be undertaken with the view of developing a \u2018maternal health system shock and resilience index\u2019 to allow for a simple comparison on deficits in care at a national, local and individual level for data available through the COCOON survey, other COVID- 19 pandemic data and for maternal health system data collected in future health crises.\nProcedures At the end of the COCOON survey for participants in the UK, Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, Italy and New Zealand, parents who had experienced a stillbirth or neonatal death will be invited to leave their contact details (eg, name, email address and/or contact number) to participate in a qualitative interview (see table 1). Likewise, those parents who had experienced a late- term miscarriage and so will be screened out of the COCOON survey as ineligible to participate will also be able to leave their contact details to be contacted to participate in a qualitative interview. All qualitative interviews will be conducted by researchers in each country coordinating centre, with oversight provided by the PUDDLES chief investigator and the UK coordinating centre. Participants will be notified that by leaving their contact details their responses to this survey no longer remain anonymous.\nData management and analytical approach The international, nested, qualitative interview study will explore parents\u2019 lived experiences of late- term miscarriage, stillbirth and neonatal death during the pandemic, the bereavement care they received and implications for how bereavement care might be optimised. Qualitative interviews will be conducted using videoconferencing software or by phone (rarely: face to face depending on the country and public health guidance), digitally recorded (with the interviewee\u2019s permission) and transcribed verbatim. Interview transcripts will be subject to a\nprimary analysis in each country using grounded theory analysis74 75 (for investigation into psychological experiences) or template analysis76 77 (for an assessment of the reconfiguration of maternal, neonatal and bereavement services) to make an assessment of the country- specific experiences. Subsequently, the entire PUDDLES Global data set, which comprised participating countries\u2019 data, will be subject to a secondary thematic framework analysis78 79 to identify and interpret important intercountry patterns across the data set. NVivo will be used to assist with storage, management and coding, where appropriate. At key points in this iterative process, review and discussion with members of our interdisciplinary research team will take place to strengthen the credibility and validity of findings."

            "text": "The COVID- 19 pandemic has impacted the lives of millions of pregnant and postpartum women and their families.80 Globally, parents have experienced modifications to care practices and endured significant health service reconfiguration which have resulted in restricted access to routine healthcare, increased dependence on virtual rather than face- to- face care and limitations around labour and birth.9 Mental health and social impacts have been experienced on a global scale because of interventions to prevent and/or limit the spread of COVID- 19. Public health measures to reduce the spread of disease including social and physical distancing have significantly affected interpersonal support and social connectedness, which are robust predictors of maternal and parental mental health, in turn leading to increased rates of anxiety and depression.6 81 It is important that parent experiences of maternity care during the initial stages of the COVID- 19 pandemic as well as long term are explored. Given the global impact of the pandemic, it is also important that these studies are conducted on an international scale to allow for cross- country comparisons. Findings from the COCOON study will provide a snapshot of parent experiences during the pandemic in multiple countries and will add to the growing literature to inform guidance to care providers and families in times of social isolation and for other pandemic- related public health strategies.\nPrior to the COVID- 19 pandemic, 2 million stillbirths were reported every year globally with profound economic and psychosocial burden on families and societies.82\u201384 The COVID- 19 pandemic has contributed to an increase in stillbirths9 19 and also resulted in limitations to appropriate bereavement care and support for parents experiencing the loss of their baby both in hospital and community settings.9 The COCOON study will represent one of the largest international cross- sectional surveys conducted during the pandemic to explore parent experiences of bereavement care following the death of a baby.

The PUDDLES qualitative interview study, nested within COCOON, will also allow a more thorough investigation of the experiences of bereaved parents at this time, and represents the largest international qualitative investigation into perinatal bereavement response to the COVID- 19 pandemic.\nThere are several limitations of this study. First, this cross- sectional study will provide an overall description of the sample during different stages of the COVID- 19 pandemic but will not be able to identify reasons for individual outcomes or attribute outcomes to COVID- 19 or variants. The cross- sectional study design makes it impossible to explore change over time, or comparison with outcomes before the pandemic. Despite our attempt to make cross- country comparisons, the study design may limit these comparisons due to differential progression of the pandemic (ie, timing of peaks and subsequent waves) and public health responses (eg, lockdowns, border closures) and available health services which have varied globally. Our study is also limited due to lack of lowincome settings where unequal socioeconomic impacts of the COVID- 19 pandemic have been experienced.84 Voluntary participation and recruitment of participants predominantly conducted online and via social media will result in selection bias, and not account for potential participants\u2019 digital poverty (as only those with access to the internet can access these surveys and such respondents are likely to be more affluent and more highly educated). These factors might limit the generalisability of the findings.85 Further, different sampling methods will be used in this study with several countries conducting telephone surveys/interviews, rather than online surveys, which may result in lower face validity of items. Finally, all survey items and where validated psychometric scales were not available, translation from English to local languages (eg, Italian) was completed by each country coordinating centre and independently reviewed; however, back translation was not conducted potentially impacting accuracy, consistency and quality. These factors may limit the generalisability of findings, particularly for low- income settings.49 There is a need for further longitudinal studies to investigate the psychosocial impact of the pandemic over time, especially in low- income settings.\nThe care parents receive during pregnancy and post partum, including the care received following stillbirth or neonatal death, has important implications for immediate and longer term well- being. Given the emerging evidence of negative impacts of COVID- 19 on the health and well- being of parents, pandemic preparedness and the development of evidence- based maternity care guidelines and practices is imperative. Findings from the COCOON study will inform strategies to improve care for women and their families, provide examples of best practice (both during peak times of outbreaks and during off- peak times) and provide baseline data for ongoing\nmonitoring and evaluation in high- income and middleincome countries during this pandemic and possible future pandemic(s). This is particularly important for the delivery of appropriate and respectful bereavement care to parents following stillbirth or neonatal death."
