    "abstractText": "Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is caused by the aberrant expression of the double homeobox 4 (DUX4) gene. The FLExDUX4 mouse model carries an inverted human DUX4 transgene which has leaky DUX4 transgene expression at a very low level. No overt muscle pathology was reported before 16 weeks. The purpose of this study is to track and characterize the FLExDUX4 phenotypes for a longer period, up to one year old. In addition, transcriptomic changes in the muscles of 2-month-old mice were investigated using RNA-seq. The results showed that male FLExDUX4 mice developed more severe phenotypes and at a younger age in comparison to the female mice. These include lower body and muscle weight, and muscle weakness measured by grip strength measurements. Muscle pathological changes were observed at older ages, including fibrosis, decreased size of type IIa and IIx myofibers, and the development of aggregates containing TDP-43 in type IIb myofibers. Muscle transcriptomic data identified early molecular changes in biological pathways regulating circadian rhythm and adipogenesis. The study suggests a slow progressive change in molecular and muscle phenotypes in response to the low level of DUX4 expression in the",

            "text": "Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by the aberrant expression of the double homeobox 4 (DUX4) gene, resulting in progressive muscle loss. Symptoms of FSHD include weakness in the muscles of the face, shoulders, and upper arms, and can include limb and trunk muscles as the disease progresses [1\u20133]. It has a prevalence of 1 in 8333\u201320,000 people in the world [1,4\u20137]. Current therapies for FSHD only address its symptoms, such as shoulder fixation orthotics and physical therapy [2]. FSHD is subclassified into two subtypes, FSHD type 1 and FSHD type 2, which affect approximately 95% and 5% of individuals with FSHD, respectively [1,2]. FSHD type 1 and type 2 are clinically indistinguishable but are classified by different genomic mutations that affect the regulation of epigenetic control over the D4Z4 region. FSHD1 is linked to a contraction of the tandem D4Z4 repeat array on chromosome 4q35 to 1\u201310 repeats [8,9]. In unaffected individuals, this array contains 11\u2013150 copies of the D4Z4 repeat. FSHD2 is reported to be caused by mutations in the structural maintenance of chromosomes flexible hinge domain containing 1 (SMCHD1) gene located on chromosome 18, in the DNA-methyltransferase 3 beta gene (DNMT3B) located on chromosome 20, or in liganddependent nuclear receptor-interacting factor 1 (LRIF1) on chromosome 1 [6,10,11]. Contraction of the D4Z4 array, haploinsufficiency of SMCHD1, mutations in DNMT3B, or mutations in LRIF1 are reported to be associated with decreased DNA methylation and transcriptionally de-repress the DUX4 gene [6,10,12\u201320]. These genomic mutations cause an indistinguishable clinical presentation because they all epigenetically de-repress the\nJ. Pers.

Previous studies reported that the development of FSHD requires a combination of two genomic features to develop FSHD. In addition to the genomic mutations mentioned above, the second genomic feature necessary for FSHD pathogenesis is the presence of a functional polyadenylation signal in the pLAM region distal to the D4Z4 array [21\u201325]. This polyadenylation signal allows for the stabilization of the DUX4 mRNA transcribed from the last D4Z4 repeat for the translation of the DUX4 protein [21\u201325]. The functional polyadenylation signal, in addition to the genomic mutations listed above, allows for the transcription and translation of the DUX4 mRNA and protein, which causes FSHD. Previous studies have shown that the DUX4 protein is a transcription factor, which is expressed during early embryonic development or postnatally in the testes, thymus, mesenchymal stem cells, and keratinocytes [26\u201332]. The proposed function of DUX4 is that it facilitates early genome activation, also known as the zygotic genome activation, at the two- to four-cell stage of development [26\u201328,33]. In FSHD, the aberrant expression of DUX4 in the muscle causes the expression of germline DUX4 transcriptional targets [26]; the repression of oxidative stress response genes [34\u201337]; disruptions in cell cycle and migration [35,38]; disruption of RNA metabolism, splicing, surveillance, and transport [38,39]; and a reduction in myogenic capacity due to the misregulation of MYOD1 and its downstream targets, including structural and contractile components [28,29,33,36,37,40\u201343]. The culmination of the effect of DUX4 expression on these pathways results in progressive muscle weakness and loss in individuals with FSHD. Historically, mouse models for FSHD have had limited experimental use due to either severe phenotypes preventing long-term studies or a lack of detectable DUX4 expression and muscle pathologies [25,44\u201347]. The FLExDUX4 model carries an inverted human DUX4 transgene flanked by lox sites, which, when crossed with the ACTA1-MCM, allows for tunable DUX4 expression in the skeletal muscle of mice [48\u201350]. Induction of the DUX4 transgene in the ACTA1-MCM/FLExDUX4 mice led to FSHD-like phenotypes, but required repeated injections of tamoxifen to maintain moderate to severe levels of pathology [48,49]. The single transgenic FLExDUX4 mouse model, while presenting with no overt pathology at a young age, showed leaky expression of DUX4 despite the inverted transgene [48,49]. The absence of pathology compared to the conditional counterparts have left the FLExDUX4 mice relatively under studied. Since patients with FSHD have a wide range of clinical presentations and age of onset, it is important to thoroughly characterize all iterations of the FLExDUX4 model for their pre-clinical relevancy [19,51,52]. In this study, we hypothesized that the long-term expression of a low level of DUX4 will lead to muscle pathologies and functional deficits in older FLExDUX4 mice. To explore this, we investigated phenotypic (e.g., body and muscle weight), functional (e.g., grip strength), pathological (e.g., fiber size and typing), and molecular changes (e.g., transcriptome) in the FLExDUX4 mice at various ages to determine changes during disease progression."

            "text": "To determine molecular changes before the muscle pathology became apparent, we conducted RNA-seq of muscles from 2-month-old male mice. At 2 months of age, there were 573 differentially expressed genes (p < 0.05) in the comparison between the FLExDUX4 vs. wild-type mice. We used ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) to determine which genes are enriched in specific functional groups of genes based on the sequencing data. The IPA revealed changes in several pathways involved in growth and muscle remodeling. At two months of age, the top three ranked pathways were Adipogenesis (p < 0.001), circadian rhythm (p < 0.001), and NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response (p < 0.001) (Supplemental Table S3). Canonical circadian rhythm genes, namely Clock, Cry2, and Per2, were shown to be differentially expressed in FLExDUX4 mice [66]. The NRF2 pathway has also been reported to be Clockcontrolled and has been shown to have differential expression in FSHD [35,67,68]. In the adipogenesis pathways, Forkhead box protein O1 (Foxo1) and Lipoprotein lipase (Lpl) were both upregulated. The Foxo1 gene was reported to inhibit adipocyte differentiation and initiate muscle atrophy. The activation of Lpl by Foxo1 facilitates a metabolic switch from carbohydrate oxidation to lipid oxidation in muscle [35,67\u201372]. Indeed, BODIPY staining of quadriceps muscle from 4-month-old FLExDUX4 mice showed significant increases in intermuscular fat in the muscle (Supplemental Figure S4). Three metabolic pathways identified based on the IPA (Methylmalonyl, 2-oxobutanoate degradation I, PPAR\u03b1/RXR\u03b1 activation) play a role in lipid metabolism and generation of components for the Krebs cycle [73]. The PPAR\u03b1/RXR\u03b1 activation in addition to CD27 signaling was reported to play a role in inflammatory pathways [73]. Additional pathways identified include genes in changes in pathways involved in muscle growth (AMPK signaling), and pathways elevated in oxidative stress response (NRF-2 mediated response). These molecular changes were identified in muscles without overt pathologies."

            "text": "Most mouse models for FSHD have been limited in experimental use due to either severe phenotypes preventing long-term studies or inconsistent DUX4 expression and pathologies [25,44\u201347]. Previously published data on the FLExDUX4 single transgenic\nJ. Pers. Med. 2023, 13, 1040 12 of 20\nanimals showed that the FLExDUX4 mice showed body weight differences, had leaky expression of DUX4 mRNA, and did not show overt muscle pathology in 23-week-old female FLExDUX4 mice [48]. A more recent study reported that the FLExDUX4 mice have a mild but significant increase in fibrosis at 6 months old [74]. The goal of this project was to track changes in muscle weight, functional, and muscle pathologies in response to the leaky low-level expression of DUX4 for a long period of time. We found that the FLExDUX4 mice presented with several phenotypes as they aged. Both male and female FLExDUX4 mice had significantly weaker grip strength measurements. Male mice presented with significantly smaller body weight and muscle weight compared to their wild type littermates. In addition, the males developed the phenotypes at a younger age compared to the female FLExDUX4 mice. The RNA-seq data showed that DUX4 expression in myofibers affected gene expression associated with pathways of adipogenesis, circadian rhythm, and NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response. Pathological data showed that prolonged expression of DUX4 leads to TDP-43 positive aggregates in type IIb fibers and a decrease in the size of type IIa and type IIx fibers. The FLExDUX4 mice showed significant differences in body weight. Male FLExDUX4 mice became significantly smaller once mice reached adulthood at 4 months old which is in concordance with previously reported data by Jones et al. in 20-week-old mice [48]. Different from the previously reported data, we did not observe changes in body weight of FLExDUX4 female mice until 12 months of age [48]. Body weight and muscle weight data suggested that the FLExDUX4 mice showed sex differences. Male FLExDUX4 mice have significantly lower absolute muscle weight starting at 2 months of age and up to 12 months of age with a progressive increase in the number of muscles affected. Few muscles of the female FLExDUX4 mice showed significant weight differences until 12 months old. A previous study suggested that estrogen has a protective effect in DUX4-expressing muscles [75]. Estrogen protection in the FLExDUX4 mice may partially explain the sex differences observed in our experiment. Reproductive senescence in mice occurs between 9 and 12 months of age, which supports the age of onset of the body weight and muscle weight differences in the female FLExDUX4 mice [76]. The data generated from the ACTA1cre/FLExDUX4 female mice injected with tamoxifen, an estrogen receptor inhibitor used to induce DUX4 expression, also suggested the protective effects of estrogen in the female mice. Female mice were more severely affected compared to their male littermates after DUX4 was induced by tamoxifen injections [49]. The observation of sex differences in the body weight and muscle weight, where males are more severely affected, is similar to the observation in FSHD [41,52,77,78]. The average age of onset is by the second decade of life in males and the third decade of life in females [19,52]. In the FLExDUX4 mice, heart, diaphragm, masseter, and deltoids were mostly spared in the aged mice, which reflects the human FSHD [77,79\u201381]. However, there was no obvious preference of forelimb vs. hindlimb muscles observed in the FLExDUX4 mice. Various mouse models have been generated for the pre-clinical development of therapeutics for FSHD. Another inducible model, iDUX4pA mice, contains an inducible DUX4 gene inserted upstream of the HPRT gene and under the control of the doxycyclineinducible sgTRE promoter [45]. The iDUX4pA model also displays sex differences, but male mice have only been reported to live until 4 months of age, which can limit trial length of a potential therapeutic [45]. Like the FLExDUX4 mice, the iDUX4pA mice have alopecia, smaller body weights, and smaller muscle weights [45,48]. Flow cytometry and transcriptional analysis showed that the iDUX4pA mouse model has increased fibrosis markers in the absence of pathology, as previously observed in the FLExDUX4 model [45,74,82]. Both models have reported leaky DUX4 expression in other tissues [45,48]. Hearing loss and vasculature defects were observed in the iDUX4pA mice [45,82]. Interestingly, decreased body fat was observed in the iDUX4pA model as measured by MRI [45]. We did observe less body fat in the FLExDUX4 mice; however, no quantitative data were collected. The conditional ACTA-MCM/FLExDUX4 mice were also reported to have sex differences where the male mice were more severely affected. Conversely, when the ACTA-MCM/FLExDUX4\nJ. Pers. Med. 2023, 13, 1040 13 of 20\nmice were administered tamoxifen to induce higher DUX4 expression, the female mice are more severely affected [49]. Chronic induction and expression of DUX4 in female iDUX4pA mice was reported to cause severe phenotypes, including a prominent outward spinal curvature, pronounced muscle atrophy, and muscle weakness at the end of the 6-month study [82]. Pathological changes in muscles of the mice suggest more severe phenotypes, including inflammatory infiltration, fat deposition, and deposition of extracellular matrix [82]. With the transgene induced, the iDUX4pA model is more comparable to the ACTA-MCM/FLExDUX4 mice when the DUX4 is induced by tamoxifen. Analysis of the grip strength data showed that FLExDUX4 mice were significantly weaker than their wild-type littermates. Previous studies reported no significant difference in time to fatigue or wire hanging assessments [48,49]. These differences may be due to age differences or differences in assays used for accessing muscle strength. The muscles of FLExDUX4 mice do not have overt degeneration/regeneration during the observation period; however, we have previously reported an increase in endomysial fibrosis in the model [74]. Additionally, fibrosis pathways were activated in our current RNA-seq data through IPA at 2 months of age (p < 0.05, ranked 15), suggesting early involvement of the fibrosis pathways. Small increases in fibrosis have been shown to decrease grip strength and increase muscle weakness [83\u201385]. Muscle weakness can also occur due to additional molecular changes in the muscle [54,86,87]. Muscle biopsies from individuals with FSHD were reported to have increased expression of proteins involved in glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle, lipid peroxidation, decreased mitochondrial function, and a decreased response to oxidative stress [41,88]. In our study, we showed that from a young age, genes involved in lipid oxidation and NRF-2 stress response pathways were misregulated. Exposure to reactive oxygen species has been shown to cause decreased contractility in muscle fibers [89]. The combination of fatty acid oxidation and an impaired oxidative stress response may potentially perpetuate oxidative stress that can impact functional output [35,67,68,90,91]. In this study, we identified long-term exposure to low levels of DUX4 expression resulted in fiber-type-specific pathologies as the FLExDUX4 mice age. Basophilic TDP43 aggregates were observed in type IIb fibers specifically, while the type IIa and IIx fibers decreased in fiber size. The decreased fiber size of type IIa and type IIx muscle fibers in 12-month-old FLExDUX4 muscle suggests that chronic low-level expression of DUX4 negatively affects the fiber maintenance of type IIa and type IIx. Misregulation in circadian rhythm signaling in young FLExDUX4 mice could contribute to impaired muscle maintenance, as MyoD1 is a documented Clock transcriptional target [92]. MyoDregulated pathways have been reported to be affected in biopsies from individuals with FSHD [37]. Results from the NADH-TR staining showed angular-shaped myofibers with dark blue staining, which suggested these were atrophic fibers [54]; however, RT-qPCR of Atrogin 1 and Murf1 did not show significant differences. It is possible that subtle changes in gene expression were hard to detect when a small proportion of fibers are affected. It can also be that other pathways involved in myofiber atrophy contribute to the observed phenotype. Specific loss of type IIa and IIx fibers in muscles has been reported previously in aging and in FSHD [61,93\u201397]. Aging studies in 2-year-old murine muscle have shown that there is preferential loss of fiber size in type IIa and IIx fibers, with a 30% observed fiber loss, smaller type 2 fiber sizes, and a sparing of type IIb muscle fibers [93\u201397]. Expression profiling and proteomics of aging muscles showed increased metabolic- and mitochondrial-induced stress [93,94,97,98]. Recently, proteomic profiling of FSHD myoblasts showed that FSHD myoblasts contain a higher number of mitochondrial proteins in conjunction with reduced mitochondrial protein turnover [99]. This suggested that DUX4 expression impacted the quality of the available mitochondrial proteins, even though the quantity was not reduced [99]. Impairments in quality control mechanisms of the mitochondria have been reported to lead to an excessive generation of reactive oxygen species, disorganization of the myofiber, and malformations in the mitochondria [88,97,100]. In humans, aging mechanisms and FSHD favor the preservation of the oxidative type I\nJ. Pers. Med. 2023, 13, 1040 14 of 20\nand loss of the glycolytic type II [61,93]. Muscle groups affected in FSHD, such as the zygomaticus major, orbicularis orbis, biceps brachii, triceps brachii, and tibialis anterior, contain a large proportion of fast twitch (type 2) fibers and a lower proportion of slow twitch (type 1) fibers [101\u2013105]. Functional deficits and fiber size variation are common pathologies that are shared with the ACTA-MCM/FLExDUX4 model, the AAV-DUX4, and iDUX4pA models [25,45,49,106,107]. However, the aggregation of TDP-43 in type IIb myofibers and preferential decrease in type IIa and IIx fiber sizes are new findings from characterizing the FLExDUX4 mice [48,49,106,107]. To date, TDP-43 has only been shown to aggregate in the nucleus of FSHD myotubes in vitro but not in the cytoplasm [64,65]. Since humans were reported to not have type IIb fibers, this phenomenon may be unique to the mouse model but still worth further investigation [61,93,108,109]. Previous studies have reported the presence of inflammatory infiltrate, fibrosis, and fat deposition in affected patients with FSHD. The FLExDUX4 mice presented with mild but significant increases in fat and fibrosis in response to chronic exposure to low levels of leaky DUX4. However, the low levels of DUX4 expression do not induce severe pathologies, such as muscle necrosis and severe inflammation. When the DUX4 is induced to be expressed at a higher level in the ACTA1-cre/FLExDUX4 mouse model, the mice develop pathological changes, including degeneration/regeneration and inflammation similar to muscle pathologies seen in the affected areas in FSHD [48,49]. Please note that the less affected areas in muscles from individuals with FSHD also do not show overt pathology, which is similar to the observation in the FLExDUX4 mice. Based on these findings, we propose that the FLExDUX4 mice recapitulate the state when the muscles are mildly affected by the low level of DUX4 expression. In the conditional ACTA-MCM/FLExDUX4 models, continuous induction of the DUX4 transgene is required to maintain what has been coined as moderate levels of pathology because the regenerated muscle fibers do not express equivalently high levels of DUX4 [25,49]. Continuous induction would be required to assess long-term therapeutic efficacy in a preclinical trial [106,107]. Of note, the uninduced ACTA-MCM/FLExDUX4 mice do not have overt degeneration and regeneration [49]. However, the DUX4 protein was reported to be detected in uninduced ACTA-MCM/FLExDUX4 mice, which was not detected in the FLExDUX4 mice [48,49]. We show that the FLExDUX4 model can reliably express DUX4 mRNA up to 12 months old, which can be beneficial for testing agents directly targeting the DUX4 transcripts [48,110,111]. This will be an advantage, as consistent DUX4 expression in the model reduces concerns from DUX4 fluctuation due to the degeneration and regeneration of the muscles, such as in the ACTA-MCM/FLExDUX4 model. Further study into the FLExDUX4, uninduced ACTA1-MCM/FLExDUX4, and induced ACTA1-MCM/FLExDUX4 models to determine how different levels of DUX4 affect the pathology of the muscles would help elucidate the disease mechanisms, as would the selection of proper models for specific types of therapeutic approaches."

Males developed the disease phenotypes at a younger age in comparison to the female mice. Several molecular pathways, including pathways involved in oxidative stress response and fibrosis, were altered in the affected muscles. In addition, prolonged expression of DUX4 lead to preferential decreases in type IIa and IIx myofibers and TDP43-containing aggregates in type IIb myofibers. This study demonstrated that FLExDUX4 mice have measurable phenotypes, some of which reflect human FSHD. The functional, pathological, and molecular changes can potentially be considered to be used as outcome measures when testing agents targeting DUX4.\nJ. Pers.
