            "text": "Gonorrhea is the second most common notifiable sexually transmitted infection in the US, and its prevalence has been increasing.1 A total of 677 769 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2020 out of an estimated 1.6 M new infections that occur each year in the US.1,2 Since the historic low in 2009, reports of gonorrhea infection have increased 111%.1 Alarmingly, strains of the Gram-negative bacterium responsible for gonorrhea infections, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, have developed antibiotic resistance; and about half of all gonorrhea infections reported in 2020 were caused by an antibiotic resistant strain.1 Only one recommended treatment\nremains: the cephalosporin, ceftriaxone.2 Unfortunately, the infection often is asymptomatic in women, and if untreated, pelvic inflammatory disease leading to ectopic pregnancies and infertility can result.3 Currently, the CDC recommends that all sexually active women under age 25, as well as sexually active gay or bisexual men, be tested each year.3 In order to guide proper usage of antibiotics, to perform timely treatment, and to curtail disease spread, rapid, inexpensive point-of-care (POC) diagnostic tests are needed urgently.\nThe historical method for N. gonorrhoeae detection in a clinical sample has long entailed culturing; however, at least a day is required for results that must be generated by skilled technicians.4 Microscopic examination of urethral smears also can be used to provide evidence of infection, but the reliability of this diagnostic approach depends strongly on the quality of the specimen and the experience of the microscopist.4 Currently, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are the preferred methods for gonorrhea diagnostic detection due to sensitivities >90% and very high specificities of \u223c99%.5 However, most NAATs are conducted\nSens.

Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nin the clinical laboratory where the turnaround time also is a day or longer, and these complex systems must be operated by trained personnel. POC NAATs have emerged on the market recently (i.e., Binx io, Visby Medical Sexual Health Test),6,7 but an external power source is required for these complex devices that entail nucleic acid (NA) isolation to high purity for removal of polymerase inhibitors; tight control of complex reaction steps involving expensive, perishable reagents (e.g., primers, polymerase, and nucleotides); optical or electrochemical means to detect amplicons; and assay times of \u223c15\u201330 minutes. An ideal NA-based POC diagnostic system would exhibit an assay time of \u223c5 minutes, would be battery powered and completely portable, would be inexpensive (\u223c$20 per test), and would provide competitive sensitivity and specificity of \u226595%.8,9\nThe need for more optimal POC diagnostic tests has provided impetus for a number of studies focused on simpler, yet powerful, amplification-free, NA-based detection approaches. The \u201cgold standard\u201d limits of detection (LODs) of commercial clinical laboratory-based NAATs available for N. gonorrhoeae in urine in the \u223c1\u2013100 CFU mL\u22121 range are reflective of clinical need and correspond to NA LODs at the single-digit aM (10\u221218 M) level.10 Over the past 10 years or so, many reports, including ours, have appeared describing NA amplification-free systems exhibiting these very low LODs for NAs of specific sequence.10,11 Our system utilized here relies on the use of peptide nucleic acid (PNA) capture probes.12 PNA is an uncharged polyamide analog to DNA/RNA that we bind covalently to carboxyl-functionalized microbeads to form nearly charge neutral bead-probe conjugates. When the neutral PNA-microbead hybridizes target NA, it gains substantial negative charge thereby making it mobile in an electric field. If the negatively charged PNA-microbeads with hybridized target NA are directed to a glass nanopore of lesser diameter, they will at least partially block it, resulting in a sustained, easily measured drop in ionic current. In previous work, our group has successfully demonstrated the detection of E. coli rRNA at a concentration of 1 aM against a 106-fold background of P. putida RNA and E. coli at 10 CFU mL\u22121 against a 106-fold background of viable P. putida.11 However, few NA amplification-free detection schemes, including ours, had been tested with clinical, or even mock clinical, specimens.10"

            "text": "Detector assembly. Glass chips (1 cm \u00d7 1 cm) were micromachined from 4 in. borosilicate glass wafers (Plan Optik, Elsoff, Germany) as described earlier.11 A \u223c0.25 mm2, 1 \u03bcm-thick membrane was etched in the center of the chip and a \u223c500 nm nanopore was milled in the center of the membrane with a focused ion beam (FEI Nova 600 Nanolab DualBeam SEM/FIB). These glass chips were sandwiched between two, custom-machined Teflon chambers (each measuring 6 mm \u00d7 6 mm \u00d7 8 mm, 216 \u03bcL) with cast polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) seals (Fig. 1). A 4 mm-diameter hole drilled through the chamber walls facing the glass chip permitted buffer access on either side of the chip. A Ag/AgCl pellet electrode was placed in each, buffer-filled chamber, and voltage was controlled and current monitored using a versatile multichannel potentiostat (model VMP3) equipped with the \u2018p\u2019 low current option and N'Stat box driven by ECLAB software (Bio-Logic USA, LLC, Knoxville, TN). This assembly constituted our detection system for target N. gonorrhoeae 16S rRNA hybridized to PNA probe conjugated to microspheres (see below).\nCoupling PNA probe to microspheres. The complementary PNA probe sequence with PEG linker for detecting N. gonorrhoeae 16S rRNA consisted of NH2-(CH2CH2OCH2CH2OCH2CO)6-TTG CCA ATA TCG GCG GCC.\n13 In order to prepare microspheres to be conjugated with PNA, one \u03bcL of 820 nm-diameter carboxylic group-functionalized polystyrene microspheres, at a concentration of \u223c3.25 \u00d7 1011 mL\u22121, was suspended and washed three times in 100 mM MES buffer (pH 4.5). For each wash step, after centrifugation at 14000 rpm for 15 minutes, the sedimented pellet microspheres were resuspended in fresh MES buffer. After the third wash, the microbeads were re-suspended in 600 \u03bcL of MES buffer, and EDC (200 mM final concentration) was added to the suspension to serve as a crosslinker between the carboxyl groups on the polystyrene microbeads and the terminal primary amine groups appended on the PNA probes. This preparation was incubated for 15 minutes at 50 \u00b0C. Immediately afterward, 1.14 nmol of the PNA target probe was added followed by incubation for an additional two hours at 50 \u00b0C. Next, mPEG-amine was added to a final concentration of 100 mM followed by incubation for another hour at 50 \u00b0C. This latter conjugation step was added to\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

Finally, ethanolamine was added to a final concentration of 138 mM and incubated for yet another hour at 50 \u00b0C. Ethanolamine was added to fully cap any remaining carboxyl groups, thereby ensuring that the PNA-conjugated microbeads were nearly charge neutral. After completion of microbead surface modification, the beads were washed three times with 0.4\u00d7 SSC buffer (60 mM NaCl, 6 mM trisodium citrate, and 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 8). Each wash was conducted for 15 minutes at 14 000 rpm in microfuge tubes. One fourth of the final product was set aside for zeta potential measurements, while the rest of the PNA-beads were stored in hybridization buffer at room temperature (10 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris-HCL, pH 7). The zeta potential was measured for modified microbeads suspended in the testing buffer (10 nM KCl, 5.5 mM HEPES, 0.01% Tween-80, pH 7) using a Malvern Zetasizer nano ZS (Malvern Instruments Ltd, Worcestershire, England). A zeta potential in the negative single-digit mV range was taken as evidence of successful microbead surface modification.\nRNA extraction. N. gonorrhoeae (ATCC 43069) frozen stock was subcultured onto chocolate agar. Agar plates were incubated at 35 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 16\u201318 h. The bacterium was cultured in ATCC 814 medium to a McFarland standard 0.5 corresponding to \u223c1.5 \u00d7 108 CFU mL\u22121. The culture then was serially diluted in 0.85% saline to achieve the desired concentrations for spiking into sterilized pooled human urine (BioIVT, Westbury, NY). The background bacterial flora including E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and E. faecalis served as negative controls. The protocols for use of the direct-zol RNA Miniprep kit and TRI Reagent (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA) were followed for total RNA extraction and purification. Each extraction began with 1 mL of human urine previously spiked with 10\u2013100 CFU mL\u22121 of N. gonorrhoeae, 1000 CFU mL\u22121 of background flora, or 10\u2013100 CFU mL\u22121 of N. gonorrhoeae and 1000 CFU mL\u22121 of background flora. Extracted total RNA was eluted into 100 \u03bcL of RNase-free purified water and used within \u223c1\u20132 hours.\nHybridization of RNA to PNA-bead conjugates. Hybridization was accomplished in Vivaspin\u00ae 2 mL ultrafiltration devices with 0.02 \u03bcm-diameter membranes.\nBead-PNA conjugates in 600 \u03bcL hybridization buffer (see above) were transferred to Vivaspin\u00ae devices and spun at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes to form a compact bed of the conjugates on the membrane surface. Subsequently, extracted RNA from N. gonorrhoeae spiked in human urine was added to the loaded Vivaspin\u00ae device and spun at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes to facilitate intimate contact and hybridization of target 16S rRNA with the previously deposited bead-PNA conjugates. Finally, after two rounds of wash with hybridization buffer in the Vivaspin\u00ae, hybridized beads were collected in hybridization buffer by reverse spinning the loaded Vivaspin\u00ae devices.\nSample detection. Prior to the injection of a sample, the initial current in the absence of beads and sample was measured to verify the integrity of the glass chips. Depending on the exact nanopore size, clean glass chips had typical initial currents of 35 nA to 100 nA. After undergoing the hybridization procedure, bead-PNA conjugates potentially bound with target N. gonorrhoeae 16S rRNA were injected into the detector chamber contacting the smooth backside (opposite the etched well) of the glass chip. After bead sample addition, a potential of 1.5 V was imposed, and the current was monitored for a sustained, ionic current drop that would signal detection of target 16S rRNA. After each detection signal (indicated by sustained ionic current drop of \u223c50 s) was observed, the polarity of the electronic field was reversed to \u22121.5 V to attempt to unblock the pore. After \u223c1 min of reversed polarity, the field was flipped back to 1.5 V to confirm baseline current recovery and detection signal reproducibility."

No positive detection results were recorded for any of 10 samples of the background flora alone at a concentration of 1000 CFU mL\u22121 in human urine, which served as a negative control.\nSample data showing easily recognized, reproducible detection events as well as the lack of response to the negative control is presented as Fig. 2, and the complete results are summarized in Table 1.\nThe data presented in Table 1 provide the basis for preliminary estimates of sensitivity and specificity of 98% (95% CI: 88\u2013100%) and 100% (95% CI: 69\u2013100%), respectively, for detection of N. gonorrhoeae over the range of 10 to 100 CFU mL\u22121 when spiked in sterile, pooled human urine. Note that the first detection event for true positive cases, indicated by the first sustained ionic current drop, occurred from 500 seconds to 1500 seconds. The variation in time to signal arises from the random initial distance of beads with hybridized target from the glass chip in the detector assembly (Fig. 1d). Absence of ionic current drop for over 3000 seconds constituted negative detection (likely an extreme waiting period based on many test runs), and only one false negative was observed at 50 CFU mL\u22121. Since 50 CFU mL\u22121 is well above the detection limit of our device, we suspect that RNA instability may have played a role since samples were lysed at the off-campus clinical laboratory and subsequently transported on campus for testing. Nevertheless, the preliminary sensitivity and specificity data presented here compare very well to the currently preferred NAATs, both those that are lab-based and those that are designed for the POC.6,7\nAs an amplification-free test, this technology is considerably less complex than NAATs and avoids the need for perishable reagents (i.e., polymerase, primers, nucleotides). The current lab-based version of our amplification-free test with the glass nanopore detector requires \u223c10 minutes for RNA extraction, \u223c10 minutes for hybridization, and \u223c15 minutes for sample detection, which makes it competitive in overall assay time with many fully automated NAATs. However, the detection chamber in a microfluidic device under development is reduced \u223c10\u00d7 in characteristic dimension thereby reducing the transit time of bead-PNA conjugates with hybridized target to the glass nanopore detector. In the near future, we anticipate reporting on the time savings achieved with our glass chip detectors integrated into a microfluidic system.\nFig. 2 Detector current response to the presence of target N. gonorrhoeae 16S rRNA and the lack of response to RNA extracted from background bacterial flora alone. (a) Reproducible, sustained current signal step reductions in response to the presence of PNAbeads with hybridized target 16S rRNA extracted from N. gonorrhoeae at 10 CFU mL\u22121 in human urine. The applied voltage for detection events was 1.5 V. After a sustained current signal of \u223c50 s, the voltage polarity was reversed temporarily to \u22121.5 V to drive bead complexes away from the pore before demonstrating signal reversibility by reimposing a potential of 1.5 V. (b) No current signal in response to the presence of PNA-beads hybridized with RNA extracted from background bacterial flora spiked at 1000 CFU mL\u22121 in human urine (negative control).\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

These results suggest that this potentially rapid and inexpensive technology may one day prove advantageous for POC use. Indeed, with further improvement in overall assay time and integration of the glass nanopore detector with automated frontend sample processing, this simple, amplification-free detection technology may lead to rapid, inexpensive, low-power and portable POC pathogen detection devices with minimal reagent requirements."
