    "abstractText": "Liquid adhesive suffers from the emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that have detrimental effects on human beings. Herein, an environmentally friendly glue containing a novel supramolecule dissolved in non-toxic ethanol is developed. Poly (ether amine) (PEA) and 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde (dhba) is utilized to synthesize catechol-terminated PEA, and subsequent complexation by Fe3+ results in the supramolecular component (PEA-dhba-Fe3+). The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum together with the UV-vis spectrum reveal the existence of quinone converted from catechol. Raman spectra prove the existence of a successful complex of catechol-terminated PEA with Fe3+. The tri-complex is found to be the predominant mode and can successfully form into clusters, serving as a physical cross-linking network. The PEA-dhbaFe3+ exhibits strong adherence to metal substrates compared to polymeric substrates, with its shear strength reaching as high as 1.36 \u00b1 0.14 MPa when the pH of the glue is adjusted to 8. The obvious improvement of adhesion originates from the formation of interfacial coordination bonds between quinone/catechol and metal atoms, as well as their cations, as revealed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and theoretical calculations. With consideration of its merits, including strong adhesion and the minor emission of VOCs compared to commercial epoxy and acrylic adhesives, this environmentally friendly supramolecular glue has a range of cutting-edge applications as an adhesive for metal substrates.",

            "text": "Marine mussels have the ability to adhere to the surface of foreign bodies in seawater by secreting adhesion proteins. These mussel foot proteins (Mfps) are known to cure rapidly to form adhesive plaques with high interfacial binding strength, durability, and toughness. Through this process, mussels are able to firmly bind with organic and inorganic surfaces in aqueous environments where many other glues fail [1,2]. Herein, 3,4- dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa), which is hydroxylated by tyrosine through the transition, is one of the main components of Mfps [3,4]. Moreover, it was recently demonstrated that a small amount of Fe3+ (<1 wt%) plays an important role in this mechanism by bonding with the catechol-like amino acid (dopa) in the cuticle protein, mfp-1. Upon the addition of Fe3+ ions, the dopa-modified gelatin forms a sticky hydrogel within seconds through complexation between the dopa molecules and Fe3+ ions [5]. In contrast to covalent bonds, metal\u2013dopa bonds can spontaneously reform after breaking [6], which endows it with self-healing ability under certain conditions. Dopa has a strong binding affinity to a variety of metal oxide surfaces due to three aspects: first, the di-hydroxy functional group of catechol enables it to form the stable bidentate modes of H-bonding with the surface of the oxide substrate [7]; second, the aromatic ring of catechol can form the strongest non-covalent cation\u2013\u03c0 interaction with\nPolymers 2022, 14, 916. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym14050916 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2022, 14, 916 2 of 11\npositively charged metal ions [8,9]; third, catechol forms strong, reversible interfacial bonds with metal oxide surfaces [10\u201313].

The dhba extracted from plant resources is chosen as the catechol-containing molecule for capping the PEA. The reaction is able to take place in ethanol at room temperature due to the high activity between the aliphatic primary amine and aromatic conjugated aldehyde. The resulting PEA-dhba is actually a telechelic polymer with dual terminal catechol motifs, which are functional groups that construct the supramolecular network by complexing with cations. The chemical shift of the hydrogen in benzaldehyde (-HC=O) performs upfield shift after reaction (Figure 1b), which indicates the successful formation of a Schiff base (-HC=N) in PEA-dhba. The conversion of PEA-dhba can also be revealed by FTIR spectra: both Figure 1c and Figure S1 explicitly signify the existence of a stretching vibration of C=N at 1645 cm\u22121 for PEA-dhba and its complexed resultant PEA-dhba-Fe3+. Notably, the stretching vibration for quinone is apparent at 1688 cm\u22121. This implies the oxidation of catechol motifs in ethanol, occurring probably because of the dissolved oxygen. This transition of catechol is likely to influence the construction of the supramolecular network and its adhesive performance."

            "text": "UV-vis spectroscopy was applied to gain insights into the formation of the supramolecular network and its complexation with Fe3+. UV-vis absorbance displays a strong peak at 395 nm, corroborating the existence of quinone motifs converted from catechols (Figure 2a). There are two observable peaks contributing to the complexation of catecholato-Fe3+. Theoretically, the maximal absorption values for individual mono-, bis-, and tris-catecholato-Fe3+ complexes are located at ~759 nm,\u223c575 nm, and\u223c492 nm, respectively [14\u201318]. In this case, the observable catecholato-Fe3+ peaks are located at ~501 nm and ~622 nm, which are likely caused by the overlapping of the three individual peak signals. The peak with stronger intensity at ~501 nm signifies that the tris-complex is predominant, whereas the bis-complex is in secondary dominance and the mono-complex is quite minor in complexation.\nPolymers 2022, 14, 916 5 of 11\nThe supramolecular network was further analyzed via Raman spectroscopy (Figure 2b). The chelation of Fe3+ ions by the C3 and C4 oxygen atoms of catechol can be represented by a band consisting of peaks in the range of 490~694 cm\u22121, whereas the corresponding ring vibrations of catecholato-Fe3+complexes output peaks near 1323 cm\u22121 and 1484 cm\u22121. Specifically, the peaks at 587 cm\u22121 and 624 cm\u22121 are assigned to catecholato-Fe3+ complexation, and the other two peaks within this band are likely caused by the quinone-Fe3+ complexes. As expected, the peaks related to Fe3+-O chelation and ring vibration cannot be observed for PEA-dhba. However, apparent peaks are observed for PEA-dhba-Fe3+ with 1:3 and 1:5 feed ratios, indicating the formation of catechol-Fe3+ and quinone-Fe3+ coordination. In particular, the intensity of the peak at 587 cm\u22121 is much higher than that of the peak at 624 cm\u22121, indicating the dominance of tris-catechol-Fe3+ complexes in the polymer networks, which is in agreement with the UV-vis absorbance analysis. It can be also deduced from Figure 2a that the complexation modes remain nearly identical at pH = ~5 and pH = ~8, despite the fact that researcher-reported pH can have an intense effect on complexation modes [5,19,20]. This is presumably due to the inadequate amount of catechol motifs. The increase in the Raman intensity of the peaks at 587 cm\u22121, 1323 cm\u22121, and 1484 cm\u22121 for PEA-dhba-Fe3+ with 1:3 compared to 1:5 verifies this assumption. It is universally acknowledged that the quinone form is likely to lead to coupling between catechol and quinone [1,4,5,21]; as a result, the oxidized PEA-dhba may experience chain extension. However, the GPC results show a nearly unchanged molecular weight and polydispersion index (Figure 2c), which is evidence against the chain extension thought to be caused by dopa-quinone coupling. To this end, the predominant chemistry of PEA-dhba and PEA-dhba-Fe3+ can be displayed in Figure 2d,e. The catechol motifs dangling in the chain ends are sensitive to oxidation, even with trace amount of oxygen in the ethanol. Nevertheless, further transition to coupled catechols nearly does not take place. Fe3+ ions are far more ready to perform complexation with catechol motifs, and the tris-complex is the dominant form, meaning that the individual PEA-dhba chain ends are assembled into supramolecular networks through coordination cross-linking. The SAXS results obtained from dried PEA-dhba-Fe3+ bulk show a conspicuous scattering peak and ring (Figure 2f). The inter-cluster spacing is calculated to be 3.70 nm, which can be considered to be phase separation between the soft PEA chains and coordination-induced clusters. It strongly confirms the formation of clusters of coordination that serve to construct physical crosslinking networks. The chemical change of PEA-dhba and PEA-dhba-Fe3+ can be reflected by its color. As shown in Figure S2, the dark-brown solution of PEA-dhba is probably due to the formation of imine bonds. However, further addition of Fe3+ ions turns the solution even thicker and darker, which indicates the derivation of catechol into quinone and the formation of a catecholato-Fe3+ complex. This phenomenon was previously revealed by Marina Faiella et al., who showed that Fe3+ promotes the oxidization of catechols to quinones and mutually forms a dark-brown complex [22]. The change of rheological state is another sign of coordination. Unlike conventional waterborne adhesives, such as latex-containing high molecular weight epoxy, polyurethane, polyolefins, and so on [3,20,22], PEA-dhba-Fe3+ solutions in alcohols contain low molecular weight polymer chains. Whether or not the well-designed PEA-dhba-Fe3+, created according to the above protocols, could evolve into elastic supramolecular polymeric bulk has to be inspected in terms of rheological parameters. As shown in Figure 2g,h, the elastic and loss modulus of dried PEA-dhbaFe3+ at 1.0 Hz are measured to be 28,587 Pa and 43,274 Pa, much higher than those of PEA-dhba (0.82864 Pa and 0.52505 Pa) and PEA (0.93545 Pa and 1.8709 Pa). The results indicate that the rapid cross-linking between catechol groups of PEA-dhba and Fe3+ ions significantly improves the mechanical properties. This is because the elastic modulus reflects the rigidity of the material, and the loss modulus represents the viscosity of the material. It is worth mentioning that the loss modulus of PEA-dhba-Fe3+ is obviously greater than the elastic modulus, which means that the viscosity of PEA-dhba-Fe3+ gives it its fundamental properties. This is because the catechol structure has strong adhesion.\nPolymers 2022, 14, 916 6 of 11\nThis phenomenon is also in line with our design. Figure S3 shows the EDS mapping results of the cross-section of the PEA-dhba-Fe3+ bulk sample. It is clear that the C, N, O, and Fe elements are evenly distributed in the testing area, indicating the uniform structure of the polymer sample."

Catechol motifs have the remarkable ability to adhere to a broad variety of metal and metal oxide surfaces, which makes it an ideal anchoring group for surface modification [2\u20134]. However, the binding strength to metal substrates is highly dependent on the number of its phenolic groups, which means its binding strength will drastically reduce when the catechol is oxidized to quinone and coordinated with the incorporated Fe3+ ions (Figure 2). Assuming that predominant catechols exist in their reduced form, the amount of residual phenolic groups in the four samples at different states is shown in Table S2. Lap-shear tensile strength tests were conducted by using dried PEA-dhba-Fe3+ films (Figure 3a) to adhere the aluminum substrates. By comparing the shear strength under different ratios and different pH values, it was found that the shear strength firstly increases and then decreases with the increase in the Fe3+:dhba ratio and pH. With a pH fixed at 5, the highest shear strength was 1.13 \u00b1 0.15 MPa, as the ratio of Fe3+:dhba ratio was equal to 1:5 (Figure 3b,c). This ratio was then selected for the subsequent investigation of the adhesive properties. By adjusting the pH value of the precursor PEA-dhba-Fe3+ solutions, the highest shear strength reached 1.36 \u00b1 0.14 MPa at pH = 8, which is approximate to that of seawater (Figures 3d and S4). It explains that the cross-linking density of catecholFe3+ and the amount of residual -OH are both optimal for binding under mild conditions. The tested steel plates indicate the mechanical strength and shear strength of the bulk (Figure 3e). A low feed ratio and a high pH value lead to complete cohesive failure and low shear strength. The feed ratio at 1:5 and pH = 8 offer appropriate bulk mechanical strength that leads to the highest shear strength in spite of partial cohesive failure. Polymers 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 12\nThen, we tested the shear strength of the lap-shear samples at 25 \u00b0C, 40 \u00b0C, 60 \u00b0C, and 80 \u00b0C for 15 min and 8 h, and the results are shown in Figures S5 and S6. When treated at 80 \u00b0C for 15 min and 8 h, the highest shear strength can reach 1.01 MPa and 1.38 MPa, respectively, indicating that catechol-terminated PEA with Fe3+ can be bonded very firmly, even in a short time. Bonding tests on different substrates show that the PEA-dhba-Fe3+ has strong bonding ability to aluminum and steel (Figure 3f,g), and minor adhesion to epoxy substrates, PET, and PVC. The emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by adhesives is a major concern for consumers. Commercial adhesives developed with organic solvents or synthetic precursors release VOCs, which may cause undesirable skin and respiratory diseases. VOCs are released from commercial adhesives (i.e., the ERGO 0113 acrylic adhesive and the two-component epoxy adhesive) and PEA-dhba-Fe3+ in vessels. A gas chromatograph equipped with a mass detector (GC-MS) was used to monitor the number of instantly released VOCs over time. As shown in Figure 3h, areas of peak integration directly reflect the number of VOCs. It can be found that PEA-dhba-Fe3+ released very few VOCs within the first 25 min, whereas the epoxy adhesive had an abrupt emission of certain chemicals at ~10 min, and the acrylic adhesive constantly intensively emitted VOCs within the 25 min. On the basis of these comparative results, PEA-dhbaFe3+ has significantly better environmentally friendly features. Hence, this liquid glue can be widely used in many industrial applications with consideration to its strong adhesion, low VOCs emission, and feasible operation.

As for the PEA-dhba-Fe3+ solution in ethanol, the amount of Fe3+ ions is notably insufficient to perform complexation with all catechol and quinone groups, meaning that the system remains as a fluidic liquid, except that its viscosity apparently increases. After the ethanol is removed, this can result in a dark-brown elastomer, which is the consequence of the clusters formed by the complexation of Fe3+ with catechol and quinone groups (Figure 2f). The clusters act as a cross-linking network within the bulk and, as a result, the material exhibits the features of an elastomer. One more peculiar merit of this elastomer is that it can be feasibly processed in molten state or re-dissolved in alcohol solvents. As for the origin of adhesion to metal substrates, the abundance of remaining catechol and quinone groups plays a pivotal role in the construction of a polymer/metal interface with coordination bonds. Even though the transition of catechol moieties into quinone is unavoidable due to oxygenation, the resultant quinone groups do not have negative impacts on adhesion, but rather they readily perform interfacial coordination bonds, a kind of strong interaction that contributes to substantially improving the shear adhesive strength with reference to the conventional van der Waals interactions.\nPolymers 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 12\n6.

            "text": "In summary, we have designed a novel adhesive supramolecular glue with extraordinary binding properties for aluminum and steel plates. The catechol and quinone groups play a pivotal role in the formation of interfacial coordination bonds, contributing to the remarkable improvement of adhesion. Specifically, the shear strength for an aluminum plate can reach as high as 1.36 \u00b1 0.14 MPa when the pH is adjusted to 8. This is an improvement over those adhered to polymeric substrates. The XPS qualitatively revealed the successful formation of coordination bonds, and the theoretical calculations simulated the adsorption energies between atoms of Al or Fe and the carbonyl oxygen of quinone, which substantially confirmed the chemical interfacial bonding and also quantitatively validated its overwhelming binding effect, leading to the absence of van der Waals interactions. In addition, PEA-dhba-Fe3+ contains no toxic solvents and emits minor VOCs with reference to commercial epoxy and acrylic adhesives; thus, it is highly promising that this environmentally friendly supramolecular glue can be used in cutting-edge applications as an adhesive for metal substrates.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/polym14050916/s1, Figure S1: FTIR spectra of PEA, PEA-dhba and PEA-dhba-Fe3+; Figure S2: Photographs showing PEA, PEA-dhba and PEA-dhba-Fe3+ solutions.
