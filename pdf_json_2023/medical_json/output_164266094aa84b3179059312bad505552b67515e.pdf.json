    "abstractText": "Background The American Heart Association recently updated its construct of what constitutes cardiovascular health (CVH), called Life\u2019s Essential 8. We examined the association of total and individual CVH metrics according to Life\u2019s Essential 8 with all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD)-specific mortality later in life. Methods Data were from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005\u20132018 at baseline linked to the 2019 National Death Index records. Total and individual CVH metric scores including diet, physical activity, nicotine exposure, sleep health, body mass index, blood lipids, blood glucose, and blood pressure were classified as 0\u201349 (low level), 50\u201374 (intermediate level), and 75\u2013100 (high level) points. The total CVH metric score (the average of the 8 metrics) as a continuous variable was also used for dose\u2013response analysis. The main outcomes included allcause and CVD-specific mortality. Results A total of 19,951 US adults aged 30\u201379 years were included in this study. Only 19.5% of adults achieved a high total CVH score, whereas 24.1% had a low score. During a median follow-up of 7.6 years, compared with adults with a low total CVH score, those with an intermediate or high total CVH score had 40% (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.51\u20130.71) and 58% (adjusted HR 0.42, 95% CI 0.32\u20130.56) reduced risk of all-cause mortality. The corresponding adjusted HRs (95%CIs) were 0.62 (0.46\u20130.83) and 0.36 (0.21\u20130.59) for CVD-specific mortality. The population-attributable fractions for high (score \u2265 75 points) vs. low or intermediate (score < 75 points) CVH scores were 33.4% for all-cause mortality and 42.9% for CVD-specific mortality. Among all 8 individual CVH metrics, physical activity, nicotine exposure, and diet accounted for a large proportion of the population-attributable risks for all-cause mortality, whereas physical activity, blood pressure, and blood glucose accounted for a large proportion of CVD-specific mortality. There were approximately linear dose\u2013response associations of total CVH score (as a continuous variable) with all-cause and CVD-specific mortality. Jiahong Sun and Yanzhi Li are co-first authors. *Correspondence: Bo Xi xibo2007@126.com Full list of author information is available at the end of the article Page 2 of 13 Sun et al. BMC Medicine (2023) 21:116 Conclusions Achieving a higher CVH score according to the new Life\u2019s Essential 8 was associated with a reduced risk of all-cause and CVD-specific mortality. Public health and healthcare efforts targeting the promotion of higher CVH scores could provide considerable benefits to reduce the mortality burden later in life.",

Total and individual CVH metric scores including diet, physical activity, nicotine exposure, sleep health, body mass index, blood lipids, blood glucose, and blood pressure were classified as 0\u201349 (low level), 50\u201374 (intermediate level), and 75\u2013100 (high level) points. The total CVH metric score (the average of the 8 metrics) as a continuous variable was also used for dose\u2013response analysis. The main outcomes included allcause and CVD-specific mortality.\nResults A total of 19,951 US adults aged 30\u201379 years were included in this study. Only 19.5% of adults achieved a high total CVH score, whereas 24.1% had a low score. During a median follow-up of 7.6 years, compared with adults with a low total CVH score, those with an intermediate or high total CVH score had 40% (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.51\u20130.71) and 58% (adjusted HR 0.42, 95% CI 0.32\u20130.56) reduced risk of all-cause mortality. The corresponding adjusted HRs (95%CIs) were 0.62 (0.46\u20130.83) and 0.36 (0.21\u20130.59) for CVD-specific mortality. The population-attributable fractions for high (score \u2265 75 points) vs. low or intermediate (score < 75 points) CVH scores were 33.4% for all-cause mortality and 42.9% for CVD-specific mortality. Among all 8 individual CVH metrics, physical activity, nicotine exposure, and diet accounted for a large proportion of the population-attributable risks for all-cause mortality, whereas physical activity, blood pressure, and blood glucose accounted for a large proportion of CVD-specific mortality. There were approximately linear dose\u2013response associations of total CVH score (as a continuous variable) with all-cause and CVD-specific mortality.\n\u2020Jiahong Sun and Yanzhi Li are co-first authors.\n*Correspondence: Bo Xi xibo2007@126.com Full list of author information is available at the end of the article\nConclusions Achieving a higher CVH score according to the new Life\u2019s Essential 8 was associated with a reduced risk of all-cause and CVD-specific mortality. Public health and healthcare efforts targeting the promotion of higher CVH scores could provide considerable benefits to reduce the mortality burden later in life.\nKeywords Cardiovascular health, Life\u2019s Essential 8, Cardiovascular disease, Mortality, Prospective study"

            "text": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality worldwide [1]. The economic burden of CVD and related mortality in the United States (US) is particularly troubling with an estimated average annual cost of US $363.4 billion from 2016 to 2017 [2, 3]. Obesity, physical inactivity, poor diet, smoking, insufficient sleep duration, high blood pressure, diabetes, and dyslipidemia among adults have been identified as major risk factors to address for the successful prevention of CVD and related mortality [4].\nIn 2010, The American Heart Association (AHA) established Life\u2019s Simple 7 (ideal goals for 7 behavioral and health factors of healthy diet, physical activity, normal body mass index (BMI), no smoking, normal blood pressure, normal fasting glucose, and normal total cholesterol) to promote ideal cardiovascular health (CVH) [5]. Although the implementation of interventions targeting these factors has obtained favorable effects on CVH promotion, the prevalence of ideal CVH is extremely low (i.e., < 1%) among the US population [6]. Meta-analyses from cohort studies have shown the association of achieving a greater number of ideal cardiovascular metrics with a reduced risk of CVD and all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) [95% CI] of the highest vs. the lowest category: 0.22 [0.11\u20130.42] for CVD, and 0.54 [0.41\u20130.69] for all-cause mortality) [7, 8]. However, some included studies were solely adjusted for sex and age and failed to adjust for other important risk factors such as education level and family income [8]. In addition, Life\u2019s Simple 7 has several limitations including the confined scope of health behaviors (e.g., not including sleep health), a crude additive scoring, and less sensitivity to interindividual differences and intraindividual change [9].\nTo overcome the limitations of Life\u2019s Simple 7, the AHA\u2019s Strategic Planning Task Force and Statistical Committee recently recommended Life\u2019s Essential 8 goals to maintain optimal CVH, which added sleep health, and updated and refined the other 7 components that were part of Life\u2019s Simple 7 (particularly, changes to the scoring algorithm of components in Life\u2019s Essential 8) [9]. To our knowledge, no studies have assessed the performance of these new CVH metrics in Life\u2019s Essential 8 in relation to mortality. From a public health perspective, it is important to validate the\nimplementation and utility of these new CVH metrics in Life\u2019s Essential 8 to promote awareness and adherence to the current recommendations, thereby reducing the burden of CVD and related mortality.\nTherefore, based on nationally representative data and using the new scoring algorithm, we examined the association of the overall and individual CVH metric scores defined in Life\u2019s Essential 8 with all-cause and CVD-specific mortality among US adults. In addition, we also calculated population-attributable fractions (PAFs) of these new CVH metrics scores in relation to mortality risk."

We also estimated the proportions (%) of sex, age group, race/ ethnicity, education level, marital status, and the ratio of family income to poverty by low, intermediate, and high levels of total CVH scores. A direct method of standardization was used to calculate the age- and sex-standardized rates of all-cause and CVD-specific mortality per 1000 person-years (the number of follow-up personyears estimated from baseline to the end of the study, loss to follow-up, death, or December 31, 2019, whichever came first) according to the three categories of the total score of CVH metrics (low, intermediate, high). Kaplan\u2013 Meier survival curves were generated for the calculation of cumulative mortality using three score categories of CVH metrics (low, intermediate, high), compared using the log-rank test. Competing risk analysis was used to estimate the cumulative incidence of CVD-specific mortality in consideration of non-CVD deaths as the competing events. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to examine the associations of combined and single CVH metric scores (low level as the reference) with all-cause and CVD-specific mortality with adjustment for sex, age, race/ethnicity (model 1), and full covariates (model 2) (i.e., sex, age, race/ethnicity, education level, marital status, ratio of family income poverty, diet, nicotine exposure, physical activity, sleep health, BMI, blood glucose, blood lipids, blood pressure, and history of heart disease and stroke). When the association between each CVH metric and mortality was evaluated, this metric was excluded from adjustment. The adjusted PAFs of high (score \u2265 75 points) vs. intermediate or low CVH score (score < 75 points) were estimated for the proportion of all-cause and CVD-specific mortality that could be avoided if participants with low or intermediate CVH scores achieve high CVH scores [12]. Furthermore, the adjusted PAFs of high (score \u2265 85 points) vs. intermediate or low CVH score (score < 85 points) were also estimated since the choice of score \u2265 75 points used for the \u201chigh score\u201d definition in our main analyses was somewhat arbitrary. Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the association of total CVH metric score with all-cause and CVD-specific mortality stratified by sex, age group, race/ethnicity, educational level, marital status, and ratio\nof family income to poverty. Another sensitivity analysis was conducted with the exclusion of adults with a history of CVD or death within the first 2\u00a0years of follow-up to assess whether the findings were influenced by reverse causation. Restricted cubic spline models with three knots (10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles) were conducted to estimate the dose\u2013response association of total CVH metric score with all-cause and CVD-specific mortality, with 50 points of CVH score as the reference. We used appropriate sample weights, as well as strata and primary sampling units to obtain nationally representative estimates of the US population. All analyses were performed using STATA version 16.0 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA). A two-sided P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant."

            "text": "Based on a large nationally representative sample of US adults, we found that adults with a high level of total or individual CVH metrics in Life\u2019s Essential 8 had a reduced risk of all-cause and CVD-specific mortality. There were approximately linear dose\u2013response associations of increased total CVH metric score with reduced risk of all-cause and CVD-specific mortality. Our adjusted PAF estimates suggested that 33.4\u201333.5% of all-cause mortality and 42.9\u201370.6% of CVD mortality risk associated with low or intermediate total CVH could be avoided/ eliminated if all of those were able to obtain a high CVH metric (depending on whether the score of \u2265 75 points or \u2265 85 points was used for \u201chigh score\u201d definition). Our findings lend support to the new CVH metrics as part of Life\u2019s Essential 8 to have utility in the prediction of future all-cause and CVD-specific mortality.\nEvidence to support a protective effect of ideal CVH in Life\u2019s Simple 7 on the development of diabetes, CVD, quality of life, and mortality later in life has been shown previously [7, 8, 13\u201327]. A meta-analysis of 13 cohort studies including 193,126 adults identified a linear dose\u2013 response association with a 1-point increase in ideal CVH metrics to associate with substantially reduced risk of all-cause (risk ratio [RR] = 0.89, 95%CI = 0.86\u20130.93) and CVD-specific (RR = 0.81, 95%CI = 0.76\u20130.86) mortality [8]. However, the included studies used a crude additive scoring method in Life\u2019s Simple 7 recommended by AHA in 2010, which may oversimplify the association between CVH metrics and mortality risk. For example, two individuals with largely different amounts of physical activity (e.g., one individual with 1\u00a0min/week vs. the\nother individual with 149\u00a0min/week) would both be classified as having intermediate physical activity. However, the dose\u2013response analysis showed that the associations between these two doses of physical activity and mortality risk were substantially different [28, 29].\nBased on an enhanced scoring algorithm ranging from 0 to 100 recommended in Life\u2019s Essential 8, we found that a higher total CVH metric score was associated with a largely reduced risk of all-cause and CVD-specific mortality in a dose\u2013response manner. Our findings suggest that a small improvement in total CVH score could lead to a large reduction in mortality. This is a very important finding of the present study. Particularly among those who might now have CVD or other chronic diseases (maybe some of them are unable to achieve a high CVH score because of functional or other limitations), the improvements in CVH score will still improve their risk relative. So, the improvement at any level of the CVH score has a benefit based on the spline plots, and those with the lower CVH score seem to benefit more from a small improvement. In all, the linear dose\u2013response finding of our study suggests any improvement matters and especially for those with very low CVH. That is some improvements are better than none.\nFor the individual health behaviors, we found that physical inactivity was the major individual contributor to both all-cause and CVD-specific mortality. The association of adequate physical activity substantially reducing the risk of subsequent mortality is not new [13, 20], but our data validate the updated scoring of physical activity in Life\u2019s Essential 8 and underscore its key role in reducing the risk of mortality. We also found that\nCVH cardiovascular health, CI confidence interval, HR hazard ratio, NA not available, PAF population-attributable fraction a Adjusted for sex, age, race/ethnicity, education level, marital status, ratio of family income poverty, and history of heart disease and stroke b Adjusted for sex, age, race/ethnicity, education level, marital status, ratio of family income poverty, history of heart disease and stroke, diet, nicotine exposure, physical activity, sleep health, body mass index, blood glucose, blood lipids, and blood pressure.

            "text": "nicotine exposure was the second important individual contributor to all-cause morality. Burnt cigarette and e-cigarette use is a serious public health issue among US adults and youth [30, 31], with data from cohort studies showing that no smoking (vs. current smoking) was associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality [13, 20]. We confirmed this association albeit based on the new definition of Life\u2019s Essential 8 by the AHA where nicotine exposure includes the use of inhaled nicotine delivery system and secondhand smoke exposure [9].\nIn addition, we found that an unhealthy diet was the third important individual contributor to all-cause mortality. There is much strong evidence supporting the benefits of healthy diets in the reduction of mortality risk [32, 33]. An important change in Life\u2019s Essential 8 was the assessment of diet. In Life\u2019s Simple 7, the AHA recommended the use of only 5 aspects of diet to assess the dietary score, which included intakes of fruits and vegetables, fish, fiber-rich whole grains, sodium, and sugarsweetened beverages [5]. However, in Life\u2019s Essential 8, the AHA proposed a new, more comprehensive method for the assessment of dietary quality that incorporates the use of DASH-style eating patterns or the Healthy Eating Index 2015 for population-level assessment and Mediterranean-style eating patterns for individual assessment (especially in clinical settings). In this study, we used the Healthy Eating Index 2015 to assess dietary quality which was linked to mortality outcomes. In 2019, a national cohort study based on continuous NHANES surveys from 1999 to 2016 at baseline linked to 2011 mortality data showed that a diet score \u2265 69.3 using the Healthy Eating Index 2010 was associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality [20]. Our findings reinforce the above\nfinding that a high dietary score defined by the Healthy Eating Index 2015 as a new metric with a broader scope of dietary types recommended by AHA was associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality. Overall, lifestyle modifications including evidence-based, effective, and appropriate public education and strategies to further promote a healthy diet are important to optimize CVH and thereby prevent CVD-related mortality.\nA large body of evidence has shown short (< 7\u00a0 h) or long (> 8\u00a0 h) habitual sleep duration associates with allcause and CVD-specific mortality [34, 35]. As a result of this evidence, a notable change in Life\u2019s Essential 8 by the AHA was the inclusion of a metric for sleep [9] in addition to the original 7 CVH metrics in Life\u2019s Simple 7 [5]. Taking advantage of sleep health as one of the AHA CVH metrics, we found that the risk for all-cause mortality significantly reduced with the increase in sleep metric score. Although we observed no significant association with CVD-specific mortality, patterns suggestive of a benefit to these outcomes were observed. However, it should be noted that the adjusted PAFs of sleep health with all-cause and CVD-specific mortality were relatively small (< 10%), suggesting that this CVH metric might be not more important than expected.\nSimilar to the previous findings based on the blood pressure metric in Life\u2019s Simple 7 [13, 20], we also found that blood pressure was an important individual contributor to CVD-specific mortality. However, inconsistent with the previous finding that HbA1c contributed least to CVD-specific mortality [13], we found that blood glucose (i.e., both fasting blood glucose and HbA1c were considered in Life\u2019s Essential 8) was one of the three leading contributors to CVD-specific mortality. The difference\nmight be explained by the change in definition for the fasting blood glucose metric in Life\u2019s Simple 7, which likely did not comprehensively reflect the glycemic status and contribution to risk, and the various reference groups were used (i.e., score < 50 points in our study vs. HbA1c \u2265 5.7% reported by Yang et\u00a0 al. [13]). Using the blood glucose definition revised for Life\u2019s Essential 8 that includes both fasting blood glucose and HbA1c [9], our findings underline the importance of improving blood glucose to better reflect risk.\nConsistent with a meta-analysis of 13 prospective studies among 193,126 participants, which determined the association between the ideal BMI metric defined by Life\u2019s Simple 7 and the risk of cardiovascular events or mortality [8], we found that the BMI score, as defined in Life\u2019s Essential 8, was also not associated with all-cause and CVD-specific mortality. We also found that blood lipid score was not associated with all-cause and CVDspecific mortality, which was also consistent with previous data [8, 20]. Indeed, the U-shaped association of BMI and total cholesterol with CVD-specific mortality has been well-documented [36, 37], which might explain the non-statistically significant association we observed in our study given the AHA defined the lowest level of BMI or non-HDL cholesterol as the highest score in Life\u2019s Essential 8. These findings suggest that the AHA should rescore the ideal level of BMI or blood lipids in future updates.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first large-scale, nationally representative cohort study to examine the association of total and individual CVH metrics using Life\u2019s Essential 8 and mortality risk. In addition, we performed dose\u2013response associations between overall CVH score and mortality risk and found that an increased CVH score significantly lowered the risk of mortality. However, several potential limitations warrant consideration. First, four lifestyle factors including dietary intake, physical activity, nicotine exposure, and sleep health were self-reported, which may lead to a recall bias. Second, despite multivariable adjustment, additional confounding by measured or unmeasured covariates might have influenced the observed associations. Third, we only used measures of 8 CVH metrics in a single visit, and we did not consider metric trajectories or changes over time that might influence the observed association. However, previous studies have shown that CVH scores seem to be relatively stable or decline [38]. The potential for misclassification over time would be expected to bias the association toward the null because it is more likely that the change would occur randomly with respect to mortality. Fourth, our findings among US adults might not be directly generalized to other populations. Fifth, the sample size for cases of CVD-specific mortality in\nthe categories of CVH scores was low in some instances (ranging from 22 to 359), which might explain the nonstatistically significant associations of several individual CVH metrics with CVD-specific mortality we observed. Sixth, the overall CVH score in Life\u2019s Essential 8 is calculated using equal weights for each of the 8 CVH metrics. Seventh, the generalizability of our results to the whole US population should be made with caution due to the differences in several basic characteristics between follow-up participants and those without CVH metrics."

Physical inactivity, nicotine exposure, and unhealthy diet were the three leading individual contributors to all-cause mortality, whereas physical inactivity, elevated blood pressure, and elevated blood glucose were the three important ones to CVD-specific mortality. Our findings emphasize that primordial and primary prevention efforts on promoting CVH metrics, especially aiming at health factors and behaviors with high PAFs, should be strengthened to reduce early mortality risk later in life."
