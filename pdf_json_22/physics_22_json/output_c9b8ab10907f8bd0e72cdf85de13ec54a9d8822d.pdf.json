    "abstractText": "We study the dissipative dynamics of a fermionic superfluid in presence of two-body losses. We use a variational approach for the Lindblad dynamics and obtain dynamical equations for Anderson\u2019s pseudo-spins where dissipation enters as a complex pairing interaction as well as effective, densitydependent, single particle losses which break the conservation of the pseudo-spin norm. We show that this latter has key consequences on the dynamical behavior of the system. In the case of a sudden switching of two-body losses we show that the superfluid order parameter decays much faster than then particle density at short times and eventually slows-down, setting into a power-law decay at longer time scales driven by the depletion of the system. We then consider a quench of pairing interaction, leading to coherent oscillations in the unitary case, followed by the switching of the dissipation. We show that losses affect the dynamical BCS synchronization by introducing not only damping but also a renormalization of the frequency of coherent oscillations, which depends non-linearly from the rate of the two-body losses.",

We use a variational approach for the Lindblad dynamics and obtain dynamical equations for Anderson\u2019s pseudo-spins where dissipation enters as a complex pairing interaction as well as effective, densitydependent, single particle losses which break the conservation of the pseudo-spin norm. We show that this latter has key consequences on the dynamical behavior of the system. In the case of a sudden switching of two-body losses we show that the superfluid order parameter decays much faster than then particle density at short times and eventually slows-down, setting into a power-law decay at longer time scales driven by the depletion of the system. We then consider a quench of pairing interaction, leading to coherent oscillations in the unitary case, followed by the switching of the dissipation. We show that losses affect the dynamical BCS synchronization by introducing not only damping but also a renormalization of the frequency of coherent oscillations, which depends non-linearly from the rate of the two-body losses.\nIntroduction - The nonequilibrium dynamics of superfluids and superconductors has attracted fresh new interest in recent years. Non-linear optical spectroscopy and manipulation of collective modes in the superconducting phase have been demonstrated [1, 2] together with reports of light-induced superconductivity in variety of materials [3\u20136], among the most striking demonstration of light control of quantum matter and Floquetengineering [7\u20139]. In atomic physics the realization of fermionic superfluids [10\u201312] has led to the investigation of different dynamical phenomena, such the spectroscopy of driven superfluids [13]. These experimental developments have stimulated theoretical interest on the subject of dynamics in superfluids and superconductors [14\u201326].\nIn most cases, theoretical investigations of these phenomena have focused on the dynamics of closed isolated systems. Dissipation is however not only unavoidable in realistic experimental contexts, such as in the solid-state, but can sometime be controlled with high-degree of flexibility, as in certain ultracold atoms experiments, and used as a tool to control the dynamical long-time behavior of the system. Dissipative quantum many-body systems represent a fresh platform where novel dynamical phenomena and phase transition can appear as result of the competition between unitary evolution and dissipative couplings [27\u201330].\nA particularly interesting scenario is realized when dissipation has a genuine many-body character, since it involves correlated processes such as heating due to stimulated emission [31\u201333], spontaneous emission [34] or twoparticle losses [35\u201341]. These types of dissipative inelastic scattering processes naturally arise for example in experiments with ultracold fermions made of AlkaliEarth atoms [42\u201344]. Their role for the dynamics has recently attracted large interest in the context of Dicke\nstates [38, 45, 46] and Quantum Zeno Effect (QZE) [47] where the effective dissipation decreases as the loss rate is increased [48\u201357]. The effect of two-body losses on the dynamics of superfluids and superconductors is particularly intriguing, since dissipation here affects directly the degrees of freedom involved in the condensate and could for example couple non trivially to its collective modes or induce non trivial responses which are not expected for single particle dissipative processes.\nIn this Letter we study the dissipative dynamics of a fermionic superfluid, modelled as an attractive Hubbard model [58] in presence of weak local two-body losses. Recent works in this context have focused on simplified descriptions of dissipation in terms of a non-Hermitian Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) problem [59, 60] or an effective unitary dynamics with complex pairing potential [61]. Here, using a variational approach for Lindblad dynamics, we show that a complete dissipative BCS theory includes an effective, density-dependent, single particle loss term, which corresponds to decoupling the two-body losses in the particle-particle and particle-hole channels. We show that this term completely controls the long-time dynamics of the system leading to a universal power-law decay of particle density and to a crossover in the superfluid order parameter from a short-time exponential decay to a long-time power law decay controlled by the depletion of the system. Furthermore we show that a weak dissipation has a dramatic effect on the BCS synchronization dynamics [15] whose frequency of coherent oscillations is strongly renormalised. We understand this effect as arising from a weak-breaking of Anderson pseudospins length and construct a dissipative soliton solution which qualitatively captures the observed frequency renormalization. Our results can be experimentally tested in experiments with ultracold fermionic ar X iv :2 20 8. 02 73 9v 3\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .s\ntr -e\nl] 2\n2 Fe\nb 20\n23\n2 superfluids [62, 63], where two-body losses can be introduced through photoassociation [37, 39] as well as cavity QED simulators of nonequilibrium superfluidity [64, 65].\nModel - We consider a system of spinful fermions hopping on a lattice, in presence of a local pairing interaction as described by the attractive Hubbard model whose Hamiltonian reads\nH = \u2211 <ij>\u03c3 tijc \u2020 i\u03c3cj\u03c3 \u2212 |U | \u2211 i ni\u2191ni\u2193 (1)\nwhere\u2212|U | is the attraction and the tij the nearest neighbor hopping. The hopping gives rise to a single particle band of width W . For simplicity, we consider a band characterized by a flat density of states. Different choices do not affect in any qualitative way our results as long as the density of states is non-singular. This model has been studied in thermal equilibrium [66] in the context of the BCS to BEC superfluidity crossover [67\u201370], while its unitary dynamics has received attention recently and revealed a variety of dynamical phase transitions [71\u201377] . Here we focus on an open quantum system setting in which the evolution of the system density matrix \u03c1(t) is described by a Lindblad master equation [78], (~ = 1),\n\u2202t\u03c1 = \u2212i[H, \u03c1] + \u2211 i ( Li\u03c1L \u2020 i \u2212 1 2 { L\u2020iLi, \u03c1 }) . (2)\nwith local, on-site, jump operators describing Markovian dissipation. Here we consider dissipative processes in which pairs of fermions on the same site and with opposite spins escape from the system to the environment, leading to a jump operator of the form Li = \u221a \u0393ci\u2193ci\u2191. The resulting dissipative dynamics does not conserve the total number of particles. In absence of any driving term to counterbalance the loss of particles into the environment the system evolves at long times towards the zero density limit. We note that two-body losses conserve instead the total spin which would prevent from reaching complete depletion [46], unless the system is initially prepared in a total singlet state as it is our case here. While the stationary state properties of the model are therefore trivial its depletion dynamics can still reveal intriguing features and give rise to different dynamical regimes, as we are going to discuss.\nMethod - To study the dynamics of the system we use a time-dependent variational approach. While for unitary system the Dirac\u2019s variational principle is a standard and much used result, both for gaussian and for correlated wave functions, its generalisation to the open system case pose some challenges. Recent work [79] has proposed a variational principle for the stationary state which is however not of direct use here, where the long-time limit is the vacuum. To focus on dynamics we proceed along a different line, directly inspired by work on unitary quantum dynamics. We note that stating that a density matrix \u03c1 evolves according to Eq. 2\nis equivalent to say that the functional S[\u03c10, \u03c1aux] =\u222b dtTr [\u03c1aux(i\u2202t\u03c10 \u2212 L[\u03c10])] is stationary with respect to any given density matrix \u03c1aux. Using this condition on a Gaussian density matrix \u03c10 for which Wick\u2019s theorem applies, including normal and anomalous contractions, allows us to obtain the following variational dynamics [80]\n\u2202t\u03c10 = \u2212i [ H\u0303BCS , \u03c10 ] + \u0393 n\n2 \u2211 \u03c3 L1p\u2212loss\u03c3 [\u03c10] (3)\nwhich takes the form of an effective Lindblad master equation. Here the unitary part comes from the usual BCS mean-field Hamiltonian plus an imaginary pairing field i\u0393\nH\u0303BCS = HBCS + i\u0393 \u2211 i ( \u2206ci\u2193ci\u2191 \u2212\u2206\u2217c \u2020 i\u2191c \u2020 i\u2193 ) (4)\nwhere \u2206 is the superfluid order parameter\n\u2206(t) = 1\nV \u2211 k Tr ( \u03c10c \u2020 k\u2191c \u2020 \u2212k\u2193 ) while the dissipative part L1p\u2212loss\u03c3 [\u03c10] in Eq. (3) contains effective single-particle losses of strength \u0393eff = n(t)\u0393, with n(t) = 1V \u2211 i\u03c3 Tr\u03c10ni\u03c3 the time-dependent particle density. The variational dynamics associated to the above effective Lindbladian reads\n\u03c3\u0307xk = \u22122\u03b5k\u03c3yk + 2Im(\u03a6)\u03c3zk \u2212 \u0393n\u03c3xk (5) \u03c3\u0307yk = 2\u03b5k\u03c3 x k \u2212 2Re(\u03a6)\u03c3zk \u2212 \u0393n\u03c3yk (6) \u03c3\u0307zk = 2Re(\u03a6)\u03c3 y k \u2212 2Im(\u03a6)\u03c3xk \u2212 \u0393n (\u03c3zk + 1) (7)\nwhere we have introduced the Anderson\u2019s pseudo-spin \u03c3\u03b1k = Tr ( \u03c10\u03a8 \u2020 k\u03c3 \u03b1\u03a8\u2212k ) with \u03c3\u03b1=x,y,z given by the Pauli matrices, where \u03b5k is the bare energy dispersion of the lattice, and \u03a6(t) = (\u2212|U |+ i\u0393) \u2206(t) is the self-consistent pairing field. This dynamics describes the competition between precession of Anderson\u2019s pseudo-spin around an effective magnetic field, as in the unitary case, and lossesinduced decoherence towards the steady state \u03c3xk = \u03c3 y k = 0 and \u03c3zk = \u22121, corresponding to vanishing order parameter and density. We note that the length of the pseudo spin S = \u2211\u03b1k (\u03c3\u03b1k )2 is not conserved due to the presence of the single particle loss term proportional to the density. Furthermore the purity of the variational state P = Tr ( \u03c120 )\nis also not conserved, as expected for a dissipative Lindblad dynamics. The dynamical equations above differ therefore from those that can be obtained by Hubbard-Stratonovich decoupling [61], which essentially take the form of a unitary dynamics with a complex pairing term U+i\u0393. This difference arises due to the presence of the effective single particle loss term in Eq. (3), that couples the Keldysh contours. We will discuss below the consequences of this term for the physics of the problem. We note that instead the equations above coincide with those that can be obtained through a direct mean-field decoupling of Hamiltonian and dissipator, including both contributions coming from particle-particle and particlehole channels.\n3 10\u22125 10\u22121 |\u2206|/\u2206(t = 0)\n10\u22125\n10\u22121\n\u223c t\u22122\n100 102\ntime [W\u22121]\n10\u22125\n10\u22121\n10\u22122\n10\u22121\n100\n\u0393/|U | = 0.08\nn/n(t = 0)\n10\u22122\n10\u22121\n100\n\u223c t\u22121\n\u0393/|U | = 0.12\n100 102\ntime [W\u22121]\n10\u22122\n10\u22121\n100\n\u0393/|U | = 0.16\n0.05 0.10 0.15\n\u0393/|U |\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400 \u03c4\nFigure 1.

Dashed lines represent the dissipative dynamics considering single-particle losses in place of the two-body ones. The inset shows the time scale of the crossover from the exponential to power law behavior of the order parameter amplitude (vertical lines in left panels.)\nResults - Dissipation quench We begin our discussion from the dynamics after a sudden switching of the twobody losses \u0393, starting from the ground-state of the attractive Hubbard model with |U |/W = 1.0.\nIn Fig. 1 we plot the time evolution of the order parameter \u2206(t) and particle density n(t) for different values of the dissipation measured with respect to the interaction \u0393/|U |. We see in the right panels that the density remains constant at short times while above a time scale which depends weakly on the loss rate it displays a power-law decay towards zero, corresponding to the vacuum state, with an exponent \u223c t\u22121 which is independent of \u0393. On the other hand the dynamics of the superfluid order parameter \u2206(t) is richer and shows a crossover from an exponential decay at short times followed by a slower power law decay on longer time scales. Importantly, we see that the decay of the order parameter is faster than the density and compatible with a power law decay |\u2206| \u223c 1/t2, whose origin we will discuss below. We argue that the crossover in the dynamics of the order parameter, occurring on a time scale \u03c4 which decreases with \u0393 (see inset in Fig. 1), is a key dynamical signature of a dissipative superfluid with two-body losses, and it is\ncontrolled by the slow depletion of the system. For comparison, we show in Fig. 1 the behaviour obtained when only single-particle losses (dashed lines) are present, or in the presence of an additional single-particle pump to keep the density constant in time (dot-dashed lines) [80]. In both cases, the long-time behavior of the order parameter changes into an exponential decay. The same happens for the density in the single-particle loss case.\nTo gain further insights we derive [80] the dynamical equation for the single particle density n = 1V \u2211 k \u03c3 z k + 1 from Eqs. (S26-S28)\ndn dt = \u22122\u0393|\u2206|2 \u2212 \u0393n2 . (8)\nThe first term in Eq. (8) describes the depletion due to losses of Cooper pairs [61], while the second one accounts for the contribution of non-condensed pairs. This term, which arises due to the effective single-particle losses included in our variational approach (see Eq. (3)), is always present even when the system is in the normal phase and it becomes dominant at long-times, correctly ensures that the steady state is the vacuum independently of the initial state. In fact this second term is responsible for the power-law decay of the density, as one can readily understand by disregarding the order parameter, which gives n\u0307 \u223c \u2212n2, implying n \u223c 1/t. We can now understand the long-time behavior of the superfluid order parameter described in Fig. 1. Due to two-body losses, each of the \u03c3 x/y k components Anderson pseudo-spin experience an effective single particle dissipation \u0393eff = n(t)\u0393 decreasing as 1/t at long times, leading to a \u223c 1/t power-law decay for each k\u2212mode. In addition, due to the pseudospin precession, each mode acquires a time dependent phase which leads to an additional dephasing of the order parameter. At long times, when |\u2206| 1, the dephasing gives and additional \u223c 1/t decay, thus explaining the overall 1/t2. The crossover from exponential to power-law decay in the order parameter is controlled by the time scale at which the particle density enters the power-law decay regime. On the other hand if the particle density is kept constant (by means of an additional pump) or in presence only of single particle losses, the decay rate for the pseudo-spins is constant in time, giving rise to an order parameter which decays exponentially [80]. Results - Double quench We now consider the dynamics after a double quench, where first at some negative time the pairing interaction is suddenly changed Ui \u2192 Uf and then the two-body losses are suddenly switched on at time t = 0. This dynamical protocol allows to discuss the effect of correlated dissipation on the dynamical synchronization transition [14\u201317] that is known to occur in the isolated case.\nIn Fig. 2 we plot the dynamics of the order parameter \u2206(t) after a quench of the pairing attraction from |Ui|/W = 0.125 to |Uf |/W = 1.0, corresponding to the synchronized BCS regime in the isolated system, and for\n4 0.00 0.25|\u2206 |\n0.00\n0.25|\u2206 |\n\u2212100 0 100 200 300 time [W\u22121]\n0.00\n0.25|\u2206 |\nFigure 2. Dynamics after a sudden quench of the interaction |Ui|/W = 0.125 \u2192 |Uf |/W = 1.0. For \u2212200 < time W < 0 the dynamics is unitary. For positive times we switch on a finite dissipation, \u0393/|Uf | = 10\u22127, 10\u22124, and 0.005, from top to bottom. In all the panels, the light grey lines represent the corresponding unitary dynamics.\nincreasing values of two-body losses. We compare this dynamics to the purely unitary case (grey lines in the background of each panel) where we recognize the characteristic coherent oscillations of the order parameter, with a period controlled by the ratio between initial and final gap [15]. We see that the switching of the dissipation at t = 0 drastically changes the time evolution, inducing not only a damping of coherent oscillations but also a substantial renormalization of their frequency, which increases with \u0393. Remarkably we note from the upper panel of Fig. 2 that even a tiny dissipation, corresponding to \u0393/|Uf | = 10\u22127, has a sizable effect on the oscillation frequency. To highlight this point we extract the dominant frequency \u03c9? of the coherent oscillations of the order parameter, obtained by Fourier transforming the real-time signal over a time window \u2206T = 1000W\u22121, and plot the associated period T? = 2\u03c0/\u03c9? in Fig. 3 as a function of \u0393/|Uf |. We see that T? depends strongly on the losses, with a non-linear behavior compatible with a logarith-\nmic dependence T? \u223c \u2212 log ( e\u2212T\n0 ? + c \u0393|Uf | ) where T 0? is\nthe oscillation period in the isolated case and c a numerical prefactor. As the dissipation is increased, even though remaining a small fraction of the interaction |Uf |, we see that the frequency \u03c9? tends to saturate to a value \u03c9? = |Uf |, see Fig. 3 (inset).\nThe fact that the dissipation changes so dramatically the frequency of oscillations of the order parameter is the second important result of this work. We can understand this effect by constructing a dissipative soliton solution for the BCS problem, assuming that the Anderson pseudo-spin norm conservation is weakly broken [80].\n10\u22128 10\u22126 10\u22124 10\u22122 \u0393/|Uf | 0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\nT ?

Dashed line indicates the \u03c9? = |Uf | line.\nFor small dissipation \u0393/|Uf | \u2192 0, we consider an effectively unitary dynamics with a renormalized pseudo-spin length which we determine self-consistently. We obtain a dissipative soliton train solution [15] with period T?(\u0393) = 2K(1\u2212 \u03b1(\u0393)2)/|Uf |\u2206+(\u0393), being \u03b1(\u0393) = \u2206\u2212(\u0393)/\u2206+(\u0393) and K the complete elliptic integral of the first kind. The period depends on dissipation through the soliton amplitudes \u2206\u00b1(\u0393) obtained by the solution of the selfconsistent equations [80]. Remarkably, the dissipative soliton captures qualitatively well the logarithmic dependence of the oscillation period on the dissipation, see Fig. 3 dashed lines. Quantitatively, the dissipative solitons underestimate the frequency renormalization. This can be expected as the above argument is strictly valid only for times t \u223c T?, whereas the numerical frequencies are extracted by averaging over a large number of periods \u2206T T?. At large times, \u0393t 1 the dissipative solitons are washed away by the decay of the non-equilibrium superconducting pairs which occurs through excitations of energy \u223c |Uf | 2\u03c0/T? and determine a faster oscillatory dynamics. For \u0393/|Uf | & 10\u22122 the decay dynamics quickly takes over the dissipative solitons, thus leading to the observed saturation to \u03c9? = |Uf |. Conclusions - In this work we have studied the dissipative dynamics of a fermionic superfluid with twobody losses. We have used a time-dependent variational method for open quantum systems, from which the resulting dynamics takes the form a BCS problem with\n5 complex pairing interactions and effective single particle losses that were disregarded in previous works [59, 61]. We show that the latter plays a key role for the dynamics of the system. It underlies both the power-law decay of particle density and order parameter after a dissipation quench as well as the strong renormalization of the period of coherent oscillations after a quench of dissipation and pairing interaction. We have qualitavely captured this latter effect in terms of a dissipative soliton solution.\nOur results highlight the non trivial nature of manybody dissipative processes in giving rise to universal dynamical regimes and, in particular, to novel regimes of superfluidity. Future directions opened by this work include the study of Zeno-like superfluid dynamics in the strongly dissipative regime as well as the application of the variational dynamics to strongly correlated dissipative many-body systems, such as the dissipative FermiHubbard model [39]. Finally, it would be interesting to investigate how the signatures of this dissipative dynamics can be observed in experiments with dissipative gases and cavity QED simulators.\nAcknowledgments We thank A.

(S1) Eq. S1 can be cast in term of a variational principle, by introducing an auxiliary density matrix \u03c1aux, and requiring stationarity of the functional\nS[\u03c1, \u03c1aux] = \u222b dtTr [\u03c1aux (i\u03c1\u0307\u2212 L[\u03c1])]\n\u03b4S[\u03c1, \u03c1aux] \u03b4\u03c1aux = 0. (S2)\nWe now consider a density matrix of the BCS type, \u03c1 = \u03c10, and compute the functional S2 for generic auxiliary density matrix \u03c1aux. This is straightforwardly computed by using Wick theorem. In particular, for any operator O, a trace of the type Tr (\u03c10\u03c1auxO) can be expressed as\nTr (\u03c10\u03c1auxO) = \u2211\ncontractions\nTr [ \u03c10 ( \u03c1auxO\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 )] , (S3)\nwhere the symbol ( \u03c1auxO\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 ) means the contractions using single fermionic lines of the operator \u03c1auxO. By further singling out the contractions only involving terms terms in the operator O, it is possible to reconstruct the expectation value S3 in terms of the contractions of the operator O times the expectation value of the non-contracted part of \u03c1auxO,\nTr (\u03c10\u03c1auxO) = \u2211\ncontractions\nTr ( \u03c10 O\ufe38\ufe37\ufe37\ufe38)Tr (\u03c10 \u03c1aux\u03b4O\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38 ) , (S4)\nwhere \u03b4O indicates the part of O not included in the contraction Tr ( \u03c10 O\ufe38\ufe37\ufe37\ufe38) . By applying S4 to the dissipator in the main text, and contracting in both the normal and anomalous channels, we get\nL[\u03c10, \u03c1aux] = Tr {\u03c1aux[HBCS , \u03c10]}+ ( i\u0393\u2206Tr { \u03c1aux[ci\u2193ci\u2191, \u03c10] } \u2212 i\u0393\u2206\u2217Tr { \u03c1aux[c \u2020 i\u2191c \u2020 i\u2193, \u03c10] }) \u2212 i\u0393n\n2 \u2211 \u03c3 Tr { \u03c1auxL1p\u2212loss\u03c3 [\u03c10] } (S5) where HBCS is the unitary BCS Hamiltonian with pairing \u2212|U |, i.e.\nHBCS = \u2211 <ij>\u03c3 tijc \u2020 i\u03c3cj\u03c3 \u2212 |U | ( \u2206ci\u2193ci\u2191 + \u2206 \u2217c\u2020i\u2191c \u2020 i\u2193 ) , (S6)\nand \u2206 = Tr ( \u03c10c \u2020 i\u2191c \u2020 i\u2193 ) . Plugging S5 into the variational principle S2 we get the variational dynamics for \u03c10 reported in Eq. (3) of the main text, i.e. a dynamics for the Anderson pseudospins which read\n\u03c3\u0307xk = \u22122\u03b5k\u03c3yk + 2Im(\u03a6)\u03c3zk \u2212 \u0393n\u03c3xk (S7) \u03c3\u0307yk = 2\u03b5k\u03c3 x k \u2212 2Re(\u03a6)\u03c3zk \u2212 \u0393n\u03c3yk (S8) \u03c3\u0307zk = 2Re(\u03a6)\u03c3 y k \u2212 2Im(\u03a6)\u03c3xk \u2212 \u0393n (\u03c3zk + 1) (S9)\nwith \u03a6 = (\u2212|U |+ i\u0393)\u2206. We emphasize that the density matrix \u03c10 is a Gaussian BCS mixed state with a definite value of the superfluid order parameter. We note that for our variational approach to work we do not need to write down the explicit form of this state, rather we only need to know that this state satisfies Wick\u2019s theorem (with normal and anomalous averages) to obtain the Lindblad master equation in Eq.(3) of the main text.\nS2\nDYNAMICS OF PARTICLE DENSITY AND PSEUDO-SPIN LENGTH\nHere we derive Eq.(8) of the main text, describing the dynamics of particle density in presence of two-body losses. Using the definition of the density and the variational dynamics of Anderson\u2019s pseudo-spins we have\nn\u0307 = 1\nV \u2211 k \u03c3\u0307zk = \u2212 \u0393n V \u2211 k (1 + \u03c3zk) + 2 V \u2211 k (Re\u03a6\u03c3yk \u2212 Im\u03a6\u03c3xk) (S10)\nWe can rewrite the right hand side in term of the density and the order parameter \u2206, using the fact that\n\u2206 = 1\nV \u2211 k (\u03c3xk + i\u03c3 y k) (S11)\n\u03a6 = (\u2212|U |+ i\u0393)\u2206 (S12)\nto finally obtain\nn\u0307 = \u2212\u0393n2 \u2212 2\u0393|\u2206|2 (S13)\nAn explicit solution for the particle density can be obtained easily for |\u2206| = 0 which gives\nn(t) = n0\n1 + n0\u0393t (S14)\nnamely a power-law decay of the density, n 1/t. Simlarly we can write down an equation of motion for the length of the pseudo-spins as\nL = 1 V \u2211 k\u03b1 (\u03c3\u03b1k ) 2\n(S15)\nBy taking the time-derivative and using the equations of motion in the main text we obtain\nL\u0307 = 2 V \u2211 k\u03b1 (\u03c3\u03b1k ) \u03c3\u0307 \u03b1 k = \u22122\u0393n (L+ (n\u2212 1)) (S16)\nwhere we have used the definition of the time-dependent density n = 1 + 1V \u2211 k \u03c3 z k. We see that the length of the pseudospin is not conserved in presence of dissipation, \u0393 6= 0. Here we have used the fact that the coherent part of the evolution preserves the pseudo-spin length, even in presence of an imaginary coupling in the pairing field \u03a6(t) = (\u2212|U |+ i\u0393)\u2206, and that only the effective single particle losses \u0393eff = \u0393n included in our variational treatment give rise to a pseudo-spin length decay as opposed to the description of Ref [61]. We note that the decay of the length L is only controlled by the dynamics of the density. For a particle density decaying as n(t) = n0/(1 +n0\u0393t) we obtain\nL(t) = 2\u0393n0 (1 + n0\u0393t)2\n( (1\u2212 n0)t+ \u0393n0t2/2 + 1\n2\u0393n0\n) (S17)\nFor half-filling initial state we have L(t) = 1 \u2212 2\u0393t/(1 + \u0393t)2, namely the pseudo-spin length rapidly deviates from one and then recovers it at long times in a power law fashion L(t) \u223c 1\u2212 2/\u0393t.\nCOMPARISON WITH SINGLE PARTICLE LOSSES AND ROLE OF ADDITIONAL SINGLE-PARTICLE PUMP\nIn this section we provide further details on the dissipative dynamics in the case of (i) dissipation due to single particle losses and (ii) the case where two-body losses are counterbalanced with a single particle pump term.\nIn the case of losses purely due to single-particle terms we can write the Lindblad master equation for the system as in Eq. (1) of the main text, with the same Hamiltonian part and with local jump operators given by Li = \u221a \u03931ci\u03c3, where \u03931 is the rate of single-particle loss. Applying the above variational treatment we obtain the following equations of motion for the Anderson pseudo-spins\n\u03c3\u0307xk = \u22122\u03b5k\u03c3yk \u2212 2|U |Im(\u2206)\u03c3zk \u2212 \u03931\u03c3xk (S18)\nS3\n0 50 100 150 200 time[W\u22121]\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\n1.1\nn (t\n)/ n\n(0 )\nP1 = 0.5 \u0393 P1 = 1.0 \u0393 P1 = 1.5 \u0393\nFigure S1. Dynamics of density in the case of two-body losses balanced by the single-particle pumps for different ratios \u0393/P1.\n\u03c3\u0307yk = 2\u03b5k\u03c3 x k + 2|U |Re(\u2206)\u03c3zk \u2212 \u03931\u03c3yk (S19) \u03c3\u0307zk = \u22122|U |Re(\u2206)\u03c3yk + 2|U |Im(\u2206)\u03c3xk \u2212 \u03931 (\u03c3zk + 1) (S20)\nWe see that, at variance with the case of two-body losses discussed before, the rate of dissipation \u03931 is now independent from the density and thus constant in time. Moreover, the complex interaction term is absent. The closed equation of motion for the particle density now reads\nn\u0307 = 1\nV \u2211 k \u03c3\u0307zk = \u2212 \u03931 V \u2211 k (1 + \u03c3zk)\u2212 2|U | V \u2211 k (Re\u2206\u03c3yk \u2212 Im\u2206\u03c3xk) = \u2212\u03931n, (S21)\nnamely n(t) = n0 exp(\u2212\u0393t). In the case of single particle pump, the jump operator reads Li = \u221a P1c \u2020 i\u03c3, where P1 is the rate of single-particle pump. The equations of motion read\n\u03c3\u0307xk = (\u03c3\u0307 x k)2p\u2212loss \u2212 P1\u03c3xk (S22) \u03c3\u0307yk = (\u03c3\u0307 y k)2p\u2212loss \u2212 P1\u03c3 y k (S23) \u03c3\u0307zk = (\u03c3\u0307 z k)2p\u2212loss \u2212 P1 (\u03c3zk \u2212 1) (S24)\nwhere ( \u03c3\u0307 x/y/z k ) 2p\u2212loss are the equations of motion reported in the main text. We see that the effect of single particle pump is to introduce a term which re-populates the \u03c3zk component and prevents the complete depletion of the system. Writing down the dynamics of the particle density we obtain\nn\u0307 = \u2212\u0393n2 \u2212 2\u0393|\u2206|2 \u2212 P1(n\u2212 2) (S25)\nwhere we see that a steady state solution with n\u221e = n0 = 1 and |\u2206\u221e| = 0 is established for \u0393 = P1. For different ratios \u0393/P1 we obtain steady states with n\u221e 6= n0 (Fig. S1).\nBased on the above equation of motion, we understand the difference between the two-body losses and the the cases of single-particle loss or two-body losses supplemented by single-particle pump. In both cases each Anderson Pseudo-spin at long-time has an exponential decay in time towards the vacuum with a finite rate which does not depend on time, i.e. \u03c3x,yk (t) \u223c exp(\u2212\u03931t), for the single-particle losses, and \u03c3 x,y k (t) \u223c exp[\u2212(\u0393n\u221e + P1)t], for the additional single particle pump, as one can obtain from the pseudo-spin dynamics disregarding the unitary evolution. On top of this exponential decay the unitary part of the evolution gives rise to a momentum dependent phase for each pseudo-spin, which leads to dephasing and decay for the order parameter. To estimate this decay we note that when the order parameter is small we can disregard it from the evolution and obtain an oscillation frequency set by \u03b5k which, after summing over momenta, gives rise to a 1/t decay, i.e. \u2211 k e\ni\u03b5kt \u223c \u03c10/t with \u03c10 the density of states at the Fermi level. For single-particle losses, the power-law dephasing is however subleading and the overall decay of the order parameter is exponential, as shown in Figure 1 of the main text.\nS4\nIn the case of two-body losses, our variational dynamics gives an evolution of each pseudospin with an effective decay rate \u0393eff(t) = \u0393n(t). In the long time limit we have n(t) \u223c 1/t, namely each pseudospin decays as\n\u03c3x,yk (t) \u223c 1\n1 + \u0393n0t \u223c 1/t\nrather than the exponential decay of single particle losses. In addition, including the dephasing of each pseudo-spin from the unitary evolution discussed above we obtain an overall 1/t2 decay of the superfluid order parameter, in agreement with our numerical analysis. This explains why the order parameter decays more slowly than the density. Also, this explain that the crossover towards this power law only occurs when the density starts to deviate significantly from a constant value, while for short times the order parameter decay is exponential.\nFREQUENCY RENORMALIZATION AFTER A DOUBLE QUENCH: DISSIPATIVE SOLITONS\nIn this section we briefly review the soliton solution of BCS dynamics [15] and discuss its generalization to the dissipative case to interpret the results of the double quench of interaction and dissipation.\nIn the unitary case the dynamics of the BCS problem reads\n\u03c3\u0307xk = \u22122\u03b5k\u03c3yk (S26) \u03c3\u0307yk = 2\u03b5k\u03c3 x k + 2|Uf |\u2206\u03c3zk (S27) \u03c3\u0307zk = \u22122|Uf |\u2206\u03c3yk, (S28)\nwhere for the unitary case the dynamics of the phase of the order parameter is frozen and we choose Im\u2206 = 0 and Re\u2206 = \u2206 = 12 \u3008\u03c3xk\u3009). We parametrize the pseudo-spin components as\n\u03c3xk = Ak\u2206 \u03c3 y k = Bk\u2206\u0307 \u03c3 z k = Ck\u2206 2 \u2212Dk (S29)\nwhere the coefficients Ak, Bk, Ck, Dk have to satisfy the consistency conditions\n1\n2 \u2211 k Ak = 1 \u2211 k Bk = 0 \u2211 k Ck\u2206 2 \u2212Dk = 0 (S30)\nBy plugging the ansatz S29 in the equations of motion, we determine Ak and Bk as a function of Ck and Dk. We therefore impose the conservation of the pseudo-spin\n(\u03c31k) 2 + (\u03c32k) 2 + (\u03c33k) 2 = 1 (S31)\nto obtain a dynamical equation for \u2206 which reads\n(\u2206\u0307)2 + U2(\u22062 \u2212\u22062+)(\u22062 \u2212\u22062\u2212) = 0 (S32)\nwhere the coefficients \u2206\u00b1 satisfy the conditions\n\u22062+ + \u2206 2 \u2212 = \u2212 ( 4 2k U2 \u2212 2Dk\nCk\n) \u22062+\u2206 2 \u2212 =\nD2k \u2212 1 C2k\n(S33)\nEq. S32 defines a soliton train solution of the form\n\u2206(\u03c4) = \u2206+dn\n( t\n|Uf | , 1\u2212 \u2206\n2 \u2212 \u22062+\n) (S34)\nwith period\nT = 2K(1\u2212 \u03b1 2) |Uf |\u2206+ \u03b1 \u2261 \u2206 2 \u2212 \u22062+\nThe dimensionless parameters \u2206\u00b1 are determined by the two conditions\n|Uf | \u2211 k 2 ksgn k\u221a[ U2f ( \u22062+ + \u2206 2 \u2212 ) + 4 2k ]2 \u2212 4U4f\u22062+\u22062\u2212 = 1 (S35)\nS5\nEf = \u2211 k 2U2f ksgn k\u221a[ U2f (\u2206 2 + + \u2206 2 \u2212) + 4 2 k ]2 \u2212 4U4f\u22062+\u22062\u2212\n( \u22062+ \u2212\u22062\u2212\n2 \u2212 2\n2 k U2f\n) \u2212 |Uf |\u22062+ (S36)\ncoming, respectively, from the Eqs. S30 and the conservation of the total energy after the quantum quench Ef .\nSoliton dynamics with small dissipation\nWe now extend this treatment to describe the dissipative case. We do that by assuming that for \u0393 \u2192 0, the main effect of the dissipation is to weakly break the conservation of the pseudospin norm. We therefore assume to completely drop the \u0393 dependence from the equation of motions and include all the effect of the dissipation in a change of the pseudospin length\nLk = \u2211 i ( \u03c3ik )2 \u2248 1\u2212 \u03b4Lk (S37)\nAt times \u0393t 1 we have from Eq. S16\nLk \u2248 1\u2212 2\u0393 (t\u2212 t0) (S38)\nwhere t0 is the time at which the weak dissipation is switched on and at short times we have considered n = 1. In order to get an effective unitary soliton dynamics we therefore assume that, on a time scale t \u223c T corresponding to the first soliton oscillation, the pseudospin length can be considered constant and estimated using its time averaged value\nLk \u2248 \u3008Lk\u3009 \u2261 1\u2212 \u0393T (S39)\nwhere T is the period of the soliton train to be determined. We therefore proceed by parametrizing the pseudo-spins dynamics as in the unitary case, and imposing the pseudo-spin conservation Eq. S38 with a reduced pseudo-spin length\n(\u03c31k) 2 + (\u03c32k) 2 + (\u03c33k) 2 = 1\u2212 \u0393T .\nWe obtain a dynamics equation equivalent to the one reported above with modified equations for the soliton parameters \u2206\u00b1(\u0393)\n|Uf | \u2211 k 2 ksgn k\u221a[ U2f ( \u22062+ + \u2206 2 \u2212 ) + 4 2k ]2 \u2212 4U4f\u22062+\u22062\u2212 = 1\u221a 1\u2212 2\u0393K(1\u2212\u03b12)|Uf |\u2206+ (S40) \u2211 k 2U2f ksgn k\u221a[ U2f (\u2206 2 + + \u2206 2 \u2212) + 4 2 k ]2 \u2212 4U4f\u22062+\u22062\u2212 ( \u22062+ \u2212\u22062\u2212 2 \u2212 2 2 k U2f ) = E0 + |Uf |\u22062+\u221a 1\u2212 2\u0393K(1\u2212\u03b12)|Uf |\u2206+ (S41)\nwhere we have replaced the period in Eq. S39 with T = 2K(1\u2212 \u03b12)/Uf\u2206+. In the additional Fig. S2 (left panel) we show the parameters \u2206\u00b1(\u0393) as a function of \u0393. We find that \u2206+ remains essentially constant whereas \u2206\u2212 increases non-linearly with \u0393. Computing the period of the soliton oscillations we find the logarithmic dependence that we show in the main text, Figure 3. The key for this effect is therefore the strong non-linear dependence of \u2206\u2212 with \u0393 and the fact that the period of oscillation of the soliton train is given by the elliptic integral T \u223c K(k), with k = 1\u2212\u22062\u2212/\u22062+. Increasing \u2206\u2212 shifts the period away from the logarithmic singularity of the elliptic integral for k \u2192 1.\nEventually, we emphasise that for the dissipative soliton solution we considered the density as constant. This suggests that the argument for the case of the two-body losses can be readily extended to the case of the singleparticle losses, by considering \u03931 = \u0393n ' \u0393. As a check we show in Fig. S3 that the numerical solution of the equation of motions in the presence of single-particle losses reproduces a phenomenology similar to the one presented in the main text for the two-body losses.\nS6\n0.00000 0.00025 0.00050 0.00075 0.00100 \u0393/|Uf |\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\n125\n\u2206+/\u2206+(0)\n\u2206\u2212/\u2206\u2212(0)\n0 50 100 150 200 time\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\nFigure S2.
