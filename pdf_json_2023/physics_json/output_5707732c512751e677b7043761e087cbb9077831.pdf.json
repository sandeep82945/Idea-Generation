Here, we discover a new ruthenium compound, PMC79, that inhibits 52 specifically mutated KRAS and the downstream signaling ERK and AKT proteins both 53 \u201cin vitro\u201d and \u201cin vivo\u201d. We demonstrated that PMC79 inhibits KRAS mutated kinase 54 activity and is selective for KRAS mutations not affecting the KRAS wild-type protein. 55 KRAS inhibition is not dependent on actin polymerization or on proteasome. Molecular 56 docking analysis suggests that this effect might result from protein dynamics associated 57 with the mutations. We demonstrated that low doses of PMC79 potentiate 5-fluorouracil 58 anticancer effect. \u201cIn vivo\u201d PMC79 \u201cproof of concept\u201d showed that it reduces tumor 59 growth in the CAM-xenograft model and induces necrosis of the tumor in the xenograft 60 mice model. PMC79 is a promising new \u201cmagic bullet\u201d for CRCs harboring mutated 61 KRAS. 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 Keywords: PMC79; colorectal cancer; KRAS inhibition; KRASG12V mutations; 72 KRASG12D mutation; KRASG13D mutation 73\n1. Introduction 74\nTargeting KRAS mutations has been a clinical challenge all over the years due to 75 its great relevance and role in cancer, being for many years called the \u201cundruggable 76 KRAS\u201d. Activating mutations in KRAS oncoprotein are a hallmark of cancer being a key 77 player in intracellular signaling pathways regulating the carcinogenesis process1. KRAS 78 mutations are present in around 21.6% of human cancers2,3, being most frequently 79 observed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) (80%), colorectal cancer (CRC) 80 (40%) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (35%)4 and also in 10% of ovarian and 81 endometrial cancers5. 82 KRAS hotspot mutations are frequently associated with alterations at codons 12 83 and 136, which result in G12D, G12V or G13D mutations. A special case occurs in 84 NSCLC where a switch from glycine to cysteine results in G12C mutation7. This hotspot 85 mutation account for approximately 40% of the 35% of the NSCLC cases with KRAS 86 mutation8. All these alterations lead to conformational changes in KRAS protein structure 87 resulting in its constitutive activation and the activation of the downstream MAPK and 88 PI3K signaling pathways9,10. 89 CRC is among the most prevalent type of cancer being the second cause of cancer 90 death around the world11. CRC is the second cancer type with the highest presence of 91 KRAS hotspot mutations being G12D (13%), G12V (9%), and G13D (7%) the most 92 frequently found4. There are limited therapeutic approaches for CRC bearing KRAS 93 mutations as they are resistant to all the available therapies including anti-EGFR target 94 therapy drugs such as EGFR antibodies bevacizumab, cetuximab12,13. The resistance of 95 CRC harboring KRAS mutations to these inhibitors creates a clinically relevant problem 96 that needs to be overcome. 97\nFor many years, KRAS was considered an \u201cundruggable\u201d target, however, in 98 recent years this perspective has changed with the appearance of several molecules 99\ncapable of inhibiting this protein14. 100 Despite all the efforts performed over the years, specific targeting of KRAS 101 hotspot mutations G12V, G12D and G13D has been very difficult to achieve. The lack of 102 specific anticancer agents for targeting KRAS in CRC bearing this mutation highlights 103 the need of developing new KRAS hotspot mutations specific target drugs. In the last 104 years, two KRASG12C inhibitors, sotorasib and adagrasib, have been approved by the FDA 105 for the treatment of NSCLC with KRASG12C mutations14. These inhibitors selectively 106 form a covalent bond with cysteine 12 within the switch-II pocket of KRASG12C protein, 107 thereby locking KRAS in the inactive state15\u201321. However, KRASG12C mutation is only 108 present in 3% of CRCs which makes these inhibitors ineffective against CRCs with 109 mutated KRAS22. Recent studies have identified a potent and selective KRASG12D 110 inhibitor, MRTX113, whose antitumor benefit promoting tumor regression was only 111 demonstrated in a murine autochthonous pancreatic cancer model23,24. Despite some 112 KRAS inhibitors have entered clinical trials, most of them target KRASG12C 113 mutations21,25\u201328 and these were the only ones approved for clinical use. To the best of 114 our knowledge, no KRAS inhibitors are available in the clinics to specifically target all 115 KRAS hotspot mutations present in CRC. 116 Metal complexes in cancer therapy have attracted high interest over the years29\u2013117 31. Since the successful discovery of cisplatin in 1965, a new era in the metal-based 118 anticancer drugs history has emerged32. Cisplatin and its derivatives, oxaliplatin and 119 carboplatin, are the most studied group of metallodrugs and have been broadly used to 120 treat several cancer types, including CRC33. However, the numerous side effects and drug 121 resistance problems, and the absence of specific targets have limited their use34. Recently, 122\nseveral other metal complexes emerged as alternatives to platinum drugs, namely based 123 on zinc, copper, iron, ruthenium, gold, and silver, among others32. Some of these metal-124 based compounds are already in clinical trials and several more are awaiting ethical 125 approval to enter the trial. Metal-based compounds are recognized to have a high 126 therapeutic potential mainly due to their redox characteristics, variable coordination 127 modes, and reactivity with organic substrates35. These properties increase the interest in 128 the design of metal complexes that specifically target biomolecules in cancer cells. The 129 increased specificity and selectivity for cellular targets as membrane receptors and 130 transporters, intracellular enzymes, nucleic acids and organelles has gained a lot of 131 attention from researchers and has been an area of high progress in recent years36\u201338. 132 Of the several known metallodrugs, ruthenium compounds are one of the most 133 investigated concerning their anticancer effects and mechanisms of action, as well as 134 clinical evaluation39\u201343. Currently, there are two complexes in clinical trials: NKP1339 135 for CRC treatment and photodynamic therapy with TLD1433 for nonmuscle invasive 136 bladder cancer treatment39,44,45. 137 Over the last years, our group has been studying a family of \u201cpiano stool\u201d 138 compounds, named Ru(II)-cyclopentadienyl complexes, as potential anticancer drugs for 139 chemotherapy43. The general structure of these complexes is based on Ru(\u03b75-140 C5H5)(PPh3)(2,2\u2019-bipy)]+ structure and its derivatization. Several compounds of this 141 family showed good anticancer characteristics against a wide panel of cancer cell lines46\u2013142 58. \u201cIn vivo\u201d studies in embryo larval zebrafish model showed that some compounds are 143 well tolerable showing promising anticancer properties50,58. The mice model results 144 showed some compounds were tolerant to the maximum dose tested, despite some liver 145 toxicity49. Moreover, one of the compounds, LCR134, proved to be a specific P-gp 146 inhibitor50. 147\nIn this work, we discover for the first time that the organometallic Ru compound, 148 PMC79 [Ru(\u03b75-C5H5)(PPh3)(2,2\u2019-bipy-4,4\u2019-CH2OH)]+ (Figure 1a), has a specific effect 149\nin inhibit KRAS mutations in several CRC models with different KRAS hotspot 150 mutations. Previous \u201cin vitro\u201d studies showed that PMC79 is highly active in CRC cell 151 lines, inhibiting proliferation, migration and inducing apoptosis46,47. Furthermore, \u201cin 152 vivo\u201d studies demonstrated that this compound has an anti-proliferative capacity in the 153 zebrafish model50,58. 154 We aimed to go further on the quest of identifying the mechanism of action of 155 PMC79 analyzing its effect on KRAS signaling pathways in CRC harboring KRAS 156 mutations. To our surprise, to the best of our knowledge we discover for the first time a 157 Ru organometallic compound that specifically targets KRAS hotspot mutations G12V, 158 G12D, G13D and MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways. PMC79 provides a more direct 159 approach to selectively inhibit oncogenic KRAS mutant function while sparing the 160 function of KRAS wild-type protein in CRC. The new Ru compound PMC79 is the first 161 specific inhibitor of KRAS hotspot mutations identified, constituting a promising drug 162 for the treatment of resistant CRC with KRAS mutations. 163 164\n2. Experimental section 165\n2.1 \u201cIn vitro\u201d studies 166 2.1.1 Compounds and reagents 167 PMC79, PMC78, LCR134 and LCR220 were synthesized as previously reported 168 by us49,50,52. Cisplatin, latrunculin A, MG132 (M7449, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, 169 USA), adagrasib (T8369, TargetMol, Wellesley, MA, USA), sotorasib (T8684, 170 TargetMol, Wellesley, MA, USA) and 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) (F6627, Sigma-Aldrich, St. 171 Louis, MO, USA) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. Cisplatin, MG132, adagrasib and 172 sotorasib were stored at -20 \u00b0C, and latrunculin A and 5-FU were stored at -80 \u00b0C and 4 173 \u00b0C, respectively. 174 175 2.1.2 Cell Lines and Culture Conditions 176 CRC-derived cell lines SW480KRASG12V, SW620KRASG12V, LS174TKRASG12D, 177 HCT116KRASG13D and RKOBRAFV600E; KRASwt, were obtained from American Type Culture 178 Collection (Manassas, VI, USA). SW480 and SW620 cell lines grew in Roswell Park 179 Memorial Institute 1640 medium with stable glutamine (Biowest, Nuaill\u00e9, France); 180 LS174T and RKO cell lines grew in Dulbecco\u00b4s Modified Eagle\u00b4s Medium High Glucose 181 (Biowest, Nuaill\u00e9, France); HCT116 cell line grew in McCoy\u2019s 5A Medium (Biowest, 182 Nuaill\u00e9, France). All mediums were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (v/v) 183 (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (v/v) (Biowest, Nuaill\u00e9, 184 France). All cell lines were maintained at 37 \u00baC under a humidified atmosphere containing 185 5% CO2. 186 187\n2.1.3 Cell Treatments 188 SW480, SW620, LS174T, HCT116 and RKO cell lines were seeded at 1\u00d7105 189 cells/ml, 1.3\u00d7105 cells/ml, 7.5\u00d7104 cells/ml, 1\u00d7105 cells/ml and 1\u00d7105 cells/ml 190 respectively and adhered onto appropriate sterile plates. In some specific assays, SW480 191 cells were seeded at 7.5\u00d7104 cells/ml and 6\u00d7105 cells/ml. 24 h after seeding, cells were 192 incubated with the corresponding treatments in all experiments. For the experiments 193\nusing the proteasome inhibitor MG132, cells were pretreated with 10 M of MG132 for 194\n1 h and then co-treated with PMC79 for 8 h and 12 h. 195 196 2.1.4 Sulforhodamine B Assay 197 Sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay was performed to determine the half-maximal 198 inhibitory concentration (IC50) of PMC79 in SW620, LS174T and HCT116 cell lines and 199 adagrasib, sotorasib and 5-FU in SW480 cell line, after 48 h of treatment. 200 Cell lines were seeded in 24-well plates and after 24 h were incubated with 201 different concentrations of the compounds for 48 h. SRB assay was performed as 202 previously described46. Results were expressed relative to the negative control, which was 203 considered as 100% of cell growth. The IC50 was estimated using GraphPad Prism 8 204 software, applying a sigmoidal dose vs response (variable slope) non-linear regression 205 (n=3). 206 207\n2.1.5 Active Ras pull-down assay 208 SW480 cells were seeded in 100 mm Petri dishes and treated with different 209 concentrations of PMC79. After 48 h, RAS activity was determined by the Active Ras 210 Pull-Down and Detection Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (16117, 211 Thermo Fisher Scientific, Lafayette, CO, USA). 212\n213 2.1.6 KRAS RNA silencing 214 Small interference RNA (siRNA) targeting human KRAS was designed by 215 Horizon Discovery (L-005069-00-0020, Horizon Discovery, Cambridge, UK). SW480 216 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and after 24 h, cells were transfected with 7.5 nM 217 siRNA against KRAS. Transfection quality was monitored using a validated control (non-218\nsilencing) siRNA (1027281, Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA). SW480 cells were 219\ntransfected according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, using 3 \u03bcL of lipofectamine 220 2000 (11668019, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA). Control cells (blank) were left 221 untreated. After 6 h, the transfection mixture was removed, and cells were left untreated 222 or treated with PMC79 and incubated for a further 48 h in fresh medium. After 48 h, 223 samples were processed as described in section 2.1.9 for immunoblot analysis. 224 225 2.1.7 Actin polymerization inhibition using latrunculin A 226 Primarily, the effect of latrunculin A on cell viability was determined by the SRB 227 assay in the SW480 cell line according to the procedure described in section 2.1.4. In 228 addition, the alterations of F-actin were assessed using Alexa FluorTM 568 Phalloidin by 229 fluorescence microscopy as reported by us 46. After the determination of the latrunculin 230 A dose that inhibits actin polymerization without causing a decrease of cell growth, 231 SW480 were co-incubated with 75 nM of latrunculin A and 40 \u03bcM PMC79 for 48 h. 232 Then, cells were fixed and stained using Alexa FluorTM 568 Phalloidin. Furthermore, cells 233 were also collected for protein extraction and immunoblot analysis as described in section 234 2.1.9. 235\n236 2.1.8 KRAS-humanized Saccharomyces cerevisiae model 237 Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) W303-1A strain, deleted in RAS2, the 238 most expressed yeast RAS isoform, was transformed with human KRAS isoforms, 239 KRASwt, and the most common KRAS mutations in CRC, KRASG12D, KRASG12V and 240 KRASG13D, using the pCM184 plasmid. pCM184 yeast plasmid (TRP1) is under the 241 control of a tet-off promoter, indicating that the addition of doxycycline leads to its 242 repression59. 243 244 2.1.8.1 Saccharomyces cerevisiae growth conditions 245 S. cerevisiae cells were grown under aerobic conditions in synthetic complete 246 medium (SC: 0.17% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 0.5% (w/v) 247 ammonium sulfate, 2% (w/v) glucose, 0.2% (w/v) dropout mixture without the 248 auxotrophic marker tryptophan). Solid medium was obtained through the addition of 2% 249 (w/v) agar. All incubations were performed under the same conditions: 30 \u00b0C and 200 250 r.p.m. 251 252 2.1.8.2. Saccharomyces cerevisiae viability assay 253 Cells were grown in SC medium, at 30 \u00b0C and 200 rpm, until exponential phase. 254 Then, cells were resuspended in fresh medium to a final OD640nm of 0.3, and PMC79, 255 PMC78 and Adagrasib were added at different concentrations. DMSO was used as a 256 negative control (maximum of 0.3% (v/v)). Cell viability was assessed at time 0 and after 257 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 h. Cells were plated into YPD agar plates (YPD: 1% (w/v) yeast extract, 258 2% (w/v) peptone, 2% (w/v) glucose, 2% (w/v) agar) after serial dilutions of 1:10. After 259 incubation for 2 days at 30 \u00b0C, the number of colony forming units (CFUs) was counted 260\nand the percentage of viable cells was calculated, considering the number of CFUs at time 261 0, right before the addition of compounds, as 100%. 262 263 2.1.9 Immunoblot analysis 264 Preparation of total protein extracts of human cell lines was performed as 265 previously described in 55. Preparation of total protein extracts of yeast cells was initiated 266 after harvesting cells and resuspending in 500 \u00b5L of deionized water. First, cells lyse was 267 performed through the addition of 50 \u00b5L of 3.5% (v/v) \u03b2-mercaptoethanol in 2 M NaOH 268 solution, and incubation for 15 minutes, in ice. Then, 50 \u00b5L of 50% trichloroacetic acid 269 (TCA) was added in order to precipitate proteins. After incubation in ice for 40 minutes 270 to 1 hour, cells were centrifuged at 12000 g for 10 minutes. Samples were washed with 271 acetone and then solubilized in a solution containing 1 M NaOH and 2% (v/v) SDS. 272 Finally, the Laemmli buffer (4x: 0.25 M Tris-HCl, 9.2% (w/v) SDS, 40% (w/v) glycerol, 273 5% (w/v) \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% (w/v) bromophenol blue) was added and samples 274 were denatured at 70 \u00b0C for 15 minutes. SDS-PAGE and Western blots were performed 275 as described in 55. 276 277 2.1.10 Antibodies 278 Antibodies used were: anti-KRAS and anti-\u03b2-actin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA); 279 anti-phospho p44/42 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204) (pERK), anti-p44/42 total (ERK), anti-280 phospho Akt (Ser473) (pAKT) and anti-Akt total (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA) 281 (AKT); anti-RAS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Lafayette, CO, USA); GAPDH (Gene Tex, 282 Irvine, CA, USA); anti-yeast phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK1) (Molecular Probes, San 283 Jose, CA, USA). 284 285\n2.1.11 Statistical analysis 286 The results were obtained from at least three independent experiments and 287 expressed as mean \u00b1 SD. A one-way ANOVA with \u0160\u00edd\u00e1k\u2019s multiple comparisons test 288 and a two-way ANOVA with Dunnett\u2019s post-test were used to analyze the results. p-289 values lower than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses 290 were performed using GraphPad Prism version 8. 291 292 2.2 \u201cIn silico\u201d studies 293 2.2.1. System construction and molecular dynamics simulations 294 Herein we followed an ensemble docking approach60,61 in which the conformation 295 selection is made by the ligand among an ensemble of conformations of the apo target. 296 To generate such ensemble we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the target 297 protein. From the Protein Data Bank (PDB) we selected 3 crystal structures of the 298 GDP(Mg2+)-bound KRAS featuring the two mutations of interest, G12D (PDB: 4EPR)62 299 and G12V (PDB: 7C40)63, along with the wild-type (PDB: 4OBE)64. Protonation states 300 at pH 7.0 were assigned using PypKa65 and then, MD simulations were carried out using 301 the GROMACS software package, version 2020.666 along with the AMBER99SB-ILDN 302 force field67 for the protein while parameters for GDP were taken from reference68. The 303 guanosine diphosphate (GDP), the magnesium cation (Mg2+) and the crystallographic 304 water molecules were kept in their X-ray positions in the starting structure. A 305 dodecahedral simulation box was used with a distance between the solute and the box of 306 1.0 nm while applying periodic boundary conditions in all directions with the minimum 307 image convention. The systems were solvated with TIP3P water molecules and 308 neutralized with sodium cations. The electrostatic interactions were treated with particle 309 mesh Ewald (PME)69. Here, a short-range electrostatic cutoff of 1.0 nm was used along 310\nwith a Fourier grid spacing of 0.125 nm. A 1.0 nm cutoff was used for the van der Waals 311 interactions whereas bonds to the hydrogen atoms were constrained using the P-LINCS 312 algorithm70. The systems were initialized by performing a two-step energy minimization 313 using the steepest descent algorithm, the first without constraint, and the second using 314 constraints on bonds involving hydrogen atoms. Then, an NVT simulation was run for 315 100 ns keeping the temperature at 298.15 K using the Berendsen thermostat71 followed 316 by 100 ps of NPT simulation using the v-rescale thermostat72 while the Parrinello\u2013317 Rahman barostat73 was used to maintain pressure at 1 bar. Then, a production run was 318 performed during 200 ns. The first 20 ns of this NPT run were discarded as equilibration 319 and then, 180 equally-spaced snapshots were extracted for each system. 320 321 2.2.2 Molecular Docking 322 The ensemble of receptor structures, taken from the MD simulations, were RMSD 323 fitted and converted to the PDBQT format using the prepare ligand tool of ADFRsuite 324 version 1.174. In this step, the non-polar hydrogen atoms were removed and AutoDock 325 atom types were assigned. The GDP and magnesium were kept in the receptor structure. 326 A tridimensional model of PMC79 was built and geometry optimized with the PBE1PBE 327 functional75 using Gaussian09. The 6-31G* basis set was used for all elements apart from 328 ruthenium and phosphorus for which the LANL2TZ(f) basis set along with an effective 329 core potential was employed. The optimized structure was converted to the PDBQT 330 format using AutoDockTools, also removing non-polar hydrogen atoms, assigning 331 AutoDock atom types and the allowed torsions. Parameters for ruthenium are not 332 available, therefore, following previous reports76,77, this element was replaced by iron 333 while keeping the ruthenium-optimized distances. Such substitution is not problematic 334 since the metal is not directly exposed to the protein. 335\nThe Molecular Docking simulations were performed with AutoDockVina 1.2.578. 336 For each system (G12D, G12V, WT) and receptor conformation, compound PMC79 was 337 docked using Vina and Vinardo79 scoring functions. A search space of 25 \u00d7 25 \u00d7 25 \u00c5 338 was used, centered near Switch-II (see Figure S1, green dot). This search space is wide 339 enough as to allow the ligand to explore not only Switch-II (Figure S1, blue) but also the 340 regions near the phosphate-binding loop (P-loop, yellow in Figure S1) and Switch-I 341 (green in Figure S1). Notice the P-loop is responsible for GDP binding whereas Switch-342 I and Switch-II are key regions for the binding of small molecules. All protein-ligand 343 poses were then sorted according to the Vina and Vinardo scoring functions, thus 344 allowing to select the best conformation to bind PMC79. 345 346 2.3 \u201cIn vivo\u201d studies 347 2.3.1 \u201cIn vivo\u201d chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane assay 348 Chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay was performed as 349 described in 80. On the 9th day of development, SW480 cells (2\u00d7106 cells) were mixed 350 with matrigel and placed inside the CAM. After 4 days (day 13), tumors were treated with 351\nPMC79 (25.0 M and 40.0 M) and 5-FU (12.6 M and 73.5 M). \u201cIn ovo\u201d tumor area 352\nanalysis was performed using ImageJ software. \u201cEx ovo\u201d images were used to obtain 353 blood vessel analysis using Fiji software with \u201cVessel analysis\u201d plugin. 354 355 2.3.1.1 Statistical analysis 356 The results were obtained from at least 10 eggs per experimental condition and 357 expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. A one-way ANOVA with Dunnett\u2019s multiple comparisons 358 test was used to analyze the results. p-values lower than 0.05 were considered statistically 359 significant. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 8. 360\n361 2.3.2 \u201cIn vivo\u201d studies in nude mice 362 Animal experiments were previously approved by the Animal Ethics Committee 363 and the animal welfare body of Institute for Research and Innovation in Health (i3S) and 364 the Directorate General of Food and Veterinary and were carried out in accordance with 365 all the guidelines of the Portuguese Society for Science in Laboratory Animals and the 366 European Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, Directive 2010/63/EU. 367 In all \u201cin vivo\u201d experiments female N:NIH(S)II-nu/nu mice, strain described by 368 Azar et al. in 198081, were used. The mice were bred, housed and maintained at i3S 369 Animal House in a pathogen-free environment under controlled conditions of light, 370 temperature and humidity. The following Humane Endpoints for euthanasia were 371 established: i) any signals of distress, suffering or pain; ii) weight loss greater than 20-372 25% of the body mass; and iii) anorexia and moribund state, related or not to the 373 experimental procedure. In all experiments, mice aged 6-9 weeks old were used and were 374 monitored at least 4 times per week. 375 376 2.3.2.1 \u201cIn vivo\u201d toxicity in a colorectal cancer mice xenograft model 377 To evaluate both the lethal and the tolerated doses of PMC79 in a formulation 378 with 40% Captisol\u00ae in Milli-Q water (m/v), five doses were tested: 34, 26, 17, 13 and 379 8.7 mg/Kg per mice (n = 4 per group, except the last one in which n = 2). Mice were 380 intraperitoneally injected with PMC79 three times a week for 17 days. The control group 381 received injections of 450 \u00b5l of vehicle. Animal reaction to PMC79 was observed 382 immediately after the injection and mice were monitored and weighed every day 383 throughout the study period. On day 19, the animals were euthanized through cervical 384\ndislocation after being anesthetized by intraperitoneal (IP) injection of a solution of 150 385 mg/Kg of ketamine with 2 mg/Kg of medetomidine. 386 387 2.3.2.2 Biochemical blood analysis 388 On day 19, the animals from the toxicological study were anesthetized for whole 389 venous blood collection by intracardiac puncture. After collection, the blood was placed 390 in microtubes with about 20 \u00b5L of heparin each. The microtubes were then placed in a 391 centrifuge for 20 minutes at 3500 rpm, after which the precipitate was discarded, and the 392 supernatant (plasma) was collected and placed in a new microtube. The plasma samples 393 were further processed for biochemical analysis. 394 395 2.3.2.3 \u201cIn vivo\u201d anti-tumor activity in a xenografted colorectal cancer mice 396 model 397 A total of 16 female N:NIH(S)II-nu/nu mice were heterotopically inoculated with 398 1106 viable SW480 cells in the right side of the animal's back, slightly lateral to the 399\nscapula using a 25 g needle. As soon as the nodules were visible (day 3), mice were 400 randomized and divided into 2 groups: PMC79 treatment group (n=8; Group 1) and 401 control (n=7; Group 2). Group 1 received IP injections of 17 mg/Kg of PMC79 while 402 Group 2 was injected with the vehicle. Mice were treated accordingly to Table S1, and 403 tumors were surgically removed on days 20-32 post-inoculation as they reached an 404 average volume of approximately 1000 mm3. Tumor size was measured using calipers, 405 and tumor volumes (mm3) were estimated using the formula: W x L2 x \u00bd, where W is the 406 width and L is the length of the tumor. For tumors removal, mice were anesthetized using 407 an anesthesia machine (VetTech Solutions Ltd): anesthesia was first induced in an 408 induction chamber with 5% isoflurane and 1-2% oxygen and then anesthesia was 409\nmaintained by decreasing isoflurane to 1.5-2%. After anesthesia, a total excision of the 410 tumors was performed. To avoid pain, the mice were subcutaneously treated with a 411 solution of 0.08 mg/Kg of buprenorphine per mouse (100 \u03bcL/10 g of animal) before and 412 after tumor excision and afterward twice a day for 48 h. At the time of surgery, a small 413 piece of the tumor was placed in liquid nitrogen for protein extraction and analysis of the 414 KRAS expression. The remaining tumor was fixed in 10% buffered formalin for 415 histology. The animals that underwent surgery were not given further treatment, and 5-7 416 days after tumor removal, a weekly maintenance dose of the respective treatment began 417 to be administered. All animals were euthanized on day 67 post-inoculation (35 days after 418 the removal of the last tumors), being anesthetized using a tube with isoflurane. Lungs 419 and lymph nodes (4 submandibular, 4 axillary and 2 inguinal) were collected from each 420 animal and immediately fixed 10% buffered formalin for histology to search for 421 micrometastases. 422 423 2.3.2.4. Histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis 424 The tissues were fixed in buffered formalin and the inclusion in paraffin was done 425 according to the usual technical procedures. Histological sections of 3 microns, stained 426 with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and mounted on microscope slides were made. The 427 slides were observed with an optical microscope (Zeiss Axioskop 2) and images were 428 captured using a digital camera coupled (DS Camera Control Unit DS-L2). Histological 429 evaluation was made in blind analysis by two pathologists. The samples were compared 430 with those of control mice and histological variables as necrosis, intratumoral 431 hemorrhage, lymphocytic infiltration, peritumoral oedema, as well as the degree of tumor 432 regression were evaluated. The proliferative index of the tumor cells was assessed 433\nthrough the MIB-1 antibody that recognizes the Ki-67, being possible to count the cells 434 that are in mitosis. 435 436 2.3.2.5 Statistical Analysis 437 Statistical analysis of \u201cin vivo\u201d studies in nude mice was performed using 438 GraphPad Prism software version 9.0.0. Verification of normality was performed using 439 the non-parametric Shapiro-Wilk test. When normality was verified, an unpaired 440 parametric t-test was subsequently performed, and when this was not verified, a non-441 parametric test was performed (Mann-Whitney test). All statistical tests were two-sided 442 and p-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. 443\n3. Results and Discussion 444\n3.1 PMC79 targets specifically KRAS hotspot mutations and downstream signaling 445 molecules in CRC 446\nPrevious published results from our group revealed that PMC79 possesses a strong 447 anticancer activity in SW480 cell line with KRASG12V mutation, significantly decreasing 448 proliferation, motility and inducing apoptosis46. KRAS and KRAS downstream signaling 449 pathways, MAPK-ERK and PI3K-AKT are involved in the regulation of survival, 450 proliferation and motility, phenotypes of utmost importance in CRC carcinogenesis. We 451 decided to further explore the possible mechanism of action of PMC79 starting by 452 studying its effect on the expression of KRAS and KRAS downstream signaling 453 molecules ERK and AKT. The results demonstrated that PMC79 was able to decrease the 454 expression of KRAS, p-ERK, ERK, p-AKT and AKT in SW480 cells harboring 455 KRASG12V mutation (Figure 1b). In comparison, cisplatin and other three ruthenium 456 compounds structurally similar to PMC79 (PMC78, LCR134, LCR220) were used and 457 no alterations were observed on KRAS and KRAS downstream signaling molecules 458 expression (Figure 1b and Figure S2). 459\nBesides KRASG12V, present in 9% of CRC, there are other hotspot mutations with 460 relevant prevalence, such as KRASG12D (13%) and KRASG13D (7%). Therefore, the effect 461 of PMC79 on the expression of KRAS, AKT and ERK proteins was assessed in CRC cell 462 lines with KRASG12D and KRASG13D mutations, respectively LS174T and HCT116 cells. 463 Furthermore, to validate the results obtained for KRASG12V hotspot mutation in SW480 464 cells, an additional CRC cell line (SW620) bearing the same mutation was used. The 465 results showed that PMC79 also decreases the expression of KRAS, p-ERK, ERK, p-466 AKT and AKT in SW620 (KRASG12V) and LS174T (KRASG12D) cell lines (Figure 1c and 467 1d and Figure S3). In contrast, no alterations were observed in HCT116 cells with 468 KRASG13D mutation (Figure 1e and Figure S3). 469 In addition, to disclose the selectivity of PMC79 for mutated KRAS, we used 470 RKO a CRC cell line with KRASwt protein, and no effect on the expression of KRAS and 471 KRAS downstream proteins was observed (Figure 1f). 472 Our results suggest that PMC79 might be specific and selectively target 473 KRASG12V and KRASG12D mutated proteins and downstream signaling pathways not 474 affecting KRAS wild-type protein and signaling. Moreover, we could observe that 475 PMC79 not only decreases the expression levels of KRAS and activated (phosphorylated) 476 p-AKT and p-ERK but also of the total AKT and total ERK. These results are in 477 accordance with the studies conducted with the first direct KRASG12C inhibitor 478 recognized as a potential drug candidate, ARS-853, that also showed to reduce KRAS 479 and both phosphorylated and total levels of AKT and ERK proteins in H358 NSCLC-480 derived cell line with KRASG12C mutation, after long periods of exposure to the 481 compound27. 482\nIn the case of specific ERK inhibitors, Balmanno et al. also showed that BVD-483 523, an ERK1/2 inhibitor, decreased p-ERK and total ERK2 expression levels82. In a 484 different study, Choi et al. demonstrated that the cotreatment of cancer cells with MK-485 2206 (an inhibitor of AKT activation) and salinomycin, reduced both p-AKT and total 486 AKT levels and sensitizes cancer cells for therapies targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR 487 pathway83. Therefore, this is not the first time that a compound affects both 488 phosphorylated and total levels of ERK and AKT. Concerning sotorasib and adagrasib it 489 is known that they covalently bind to KRASG12C resulting in an upward electrophoretic 490 mobility shift of the protein band migration by immunoblot. As consequence of 491 KRASG12C inhibition, these compounds impair the viability of KRASG12C mutant cell 492 lines of NSCLC and PDAC, decrease proliferation, induce apoptosis and decrease p-ERK 493 protein levels. In addition, they also inhibit the levels of KRAS-GTP16,18. However, 494 neither sotorasib nor adagrasib affect total KRAS expression levels and PI3K signaling. 495 The absence of inhibition of the PI3K signaling pathway might provide an explanation 496 for the acquisition of resistance to these KRASG12C inhibitors18. 497 It is known that KRAS is located and binds to the inner leaflet of the plasma 498 membrane and its activation occurs at the membrane due to the conversion of GDP to 499 GTP41. The presence of a mutation in the kinase domain of KRAS results in KRAS 500 \u201clocking\u201d in the active GTP-bound state resulting in a constitutively activated state at the 501 cell14. Previous results from our group showed that PMC79 is preferentially distributed 502 in the membrane fraction46 and thus we might hypothesize that this localization might 503 explain in part PMC79 selectivity and inhibitory effect for mutated KRAS. 504\nIn order to understand if PMC79 inhibits KRAS by interfering with KRAS 505 activation, we performed an Active Ras Pull-Down assay to determine the RAS-GTP 506 abundance in SW480KRASG12V cells treated with PMC79. We showed that PMC79 507 reduced the activation of both RAS and KRAS proteins in SW480 cell line with 508 KRASG12V mutation (Figure 1g). 509 The major goal of any cancer therapy is to specifically target a protein that is only 510 present in cancer cells and not in normal cells and at the same time interfere with the 511 signaling pathways regulated by them. Inhibition of only MAPK or PI3K pathways is 512 frequently associated with acquisition of resistance to these types of treatment in NSCLC, 513 PDAC and CRC84,85. In these cases, it is necessary the combination of different drugs to 514 overthrow this problem18. We discovered a novel compound PMC79 that inhibits 515 specifically the expression of KRASG12V and KRASG12D mutations not interfering with 516 KRASwt and also blocks the downstream signaling molecules ERK and AKT both 517 essential in colorectal carcinogenesis. To the best of our knowledge, until now nothing 518 was known about the interaction of ruthenium-derived compounds with KRAS and 519 KRAS signaling pathways40. This is the first organometallic ruthenium compound 520 discovered that affects KRAS kinase activation and protein levels as well as both ERK 521 and AKT signaling pathways activation and expression in CRC harboring KRAS 522 mutations. PMC79 has the advantage of specifically inhibiting not only mutated KRAS 523 but also its downstream regulators MAPK and PI3K pathways in CRC cells with 524 KRASG12V and KRASG12D mutations. Our new drug PMC79 might constitute a promising 525 novel therapeutic approach to overcome resistance in these types of cancers. 526 527 528 529\n3.2 PMC79 is more potent in inhibiting KRAS mutation compared with other KRAS 537 inhibitors 538\nTo understand how potent PMC79 was in inhibiting KRAS mutations and 539 signaling pathways it was important to compare the PMC79 effect with other KRAS 540 inhibitors commercially and clinically available. As mentioned above, a series of 541 strategies were developed to indirectly or directly target KRAS in cancer cells14,86. The 542 inhibition of KRAS using specific siRNA has been studied as an alternative approach to 543 target KRAS mutations in CRC. Recently, two direct KRASG12C inhibitors, namely 544 sotorasib and adagrasib were developed and are already in use in the clinic for NSCLC 545 therapy16,17. 546 In this study, we use a siRNA for KRAS and the two KRASG12C inhibitors 547 adagrasib and sotorasib. We showed that PMC79 inhibits the expression levels of KRAS 548 to a similar extent when compared with the specific siRNA for KRAS (Figure 2a). In 549 addition, no alterations in the expression levels of KRAS were observed in the conditions 550 incubated with adagrasib and sotorasib (Figure 2b). 551 Although specific siRNA for mutated KRAS seem to be very efficient there is a 552 difficulty in finding efficient delivery systems that increase cellular uptake and reduce 553 off\u2010target effects of RNAi87. Preclinical efforts took advantage of nanoparticle-based 554 platforms to deliver siRNA. One example is exosomes loaded with specific siRNAs to 555 downregulate the production of mutant KRAS and this approach is under clinical 556 investigation for the treatment of PDAC with KRASG12D mutation88. 557 The results with adagrasib and sotorasib are in accordance with other published 558 studies performed \u201cin vitro\u201d and \u201cin vivo\u201d that tested these compounds in several cancer 559 cell lines with different KRAS hotspot mutations having only inhibitory effect in 560 KRASG12C mutant cell lines15\u201320. As mentioned above, preclinical studies have shown that 561\nsotorasib and adagrasib selectively inhibit KRASG12C and decrease the levels of p-ERK 562 protein but not PI3K pathway. These effects were only observed in PDAC and NSCLC 563 cell lines harboring KRASG12C mutation and not in other cancer cell lines like CRC 564 harboring other KRAS mutations like KRASG12V and KRASG12D 15\u201320. 565 Very recently, other molecules that inhibit hotspot mutations prevalent in CRC 566 are currently in preclinical trials, such as MRTX1133, JAB-22000, RMC-9805 which are 567 direct KRASG12D inhibitors, JAB-23000 is being studied for KRASG12V mutations and the 568 JAB-23400 is a multi-KRAS inhibitor. The reason we did not test some of these 569 compounds is because they are not commercially available with the exception of 570 MRTX1133. When we performed this experiment only sotorasib and adagrasib were 571 commercially available. Despite these inhibitors are being tested for possible use in CRC, 572 only KRASG12C inhibitors89 sotorasib and adagrasib are being used at the clinics but only 573 in NSCLC and not in CRC. 574\n3.3 PMC79 inhibits KRAS expression in a KRAS-humanized yeast model 582\nTo confirm the specific effect of PMC79 in different KRAS hotspot mutations we 583 used a KRAS-humanized yeast model a \u201cclean\u201d cell system using a simple eukaryotic 584 organism59. \u201cHumanized-yeast models\u201d emerged as valuable tools for studying human 585 biology. Given the huge number of conserved genes and expression mechanisms similar 586 to humans, simple genome structure, and ease of genetic manipulation these models are 587 valuable for the study of human proteins and drug screening90. 588 KRAS-humanized yeast model using Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a well-589 established model studied in our group for several years59. The model\u2019s \u201ccleanness\u201d 590 allows the study of different KRAS hotspot mutations (KRASG12V, KRASG12D and 591 KRASG13D) in the same genetic background. 592 We assessed the effects of PMC79 on yeast viability and KRAS expression levels 593 in yeasts with main CRC hotspot mutations and wild-type protein. PMC78, a ruthenium 594 compound derived from PMC79, and adagrasib, a well-known KRASG12C inhibitor, were 595 also included in these experiments as comparison. 596 The results show a drastic decrease in viability at the highest dose of PMC79 and 597 PMC78 compounds as early as the first hour of incubation in yeast with mutated KRAS 598 (Figure 3a and Table S2-S6). However, while PMC79 maintains the decrease in viability 599 until 24 h, the effects of PMC78 are recovered over time. At low doses, PMC79 shows 600 little effect on yeast viability, while the highest concentrations of PMC78 show similar 601 results regardless of the dose (Figure 3a and Table S2-S6). On the other hand, adagrasib 602 causes small changes in cell viability in all yeast strains. 603\nImportantly, the results of PMC79 in yeast with mutated KRAS are similar 604 between the different hotspot mutations. Furthermore, the drastic decrease in viability is 605 comparable to that observed in yeast with an empty plasmid (without KRAS) indicating 606 that this compound may target mutated KRAS leading to a phenotype similar to the 607 absence of this protein. In yeast with KRASwt, PMC79 decrease in viability is not 608 pronounced, indicating that the presence of the normal protein confers resistance to the 609 compound. In contrast, PMC78 and adagrasib are not able to differentiate between 610 mutated and wild-type KRAS proteins (Figure 3a and Table S2-S6). 611 The next step was to study the KRAS expression levels at 4 h of incubation with 612 the highest doses of the three compounds. Similar to what was observed previously in 613 CRC- derived cell lines, PMC79 also decreased KRAS expression in yeast with mutated 614 KRAS but did not alter the expression levels of KRASwt (Figure 3b). In contrast, PMC78 615 and adagrasib do not affect the expression of KRASG12V, KRASG12D, KRASG13D and 616 KRASwt. On the other hand, in comparison with adagrasib, PMC79 seems to be more 617 specific to target the main hotspot mutations found in CRC. 618 Contrary to what was observed in the HCT116KRASG13D CRC cell line, in yeast, 619 PMC79 also showed to affect the yeast strain containing KRASG13D mutation and 620 decrease the expression levels of this hotspot mutation. This result may be due to the fact 621 that HCT116 cell line has a complex genetic background with other mutations besides 622 KRAS, namely PI3K mutation. Indeed, both PI3K and MAPK signaling pathways are 623 known to co-regulate each other and upstream KRAS and this might result in resistance 624 to PMC7991. 625\nKRAS-humanized yeast model is a simple and \u201cclean\u201d model and the results 626 obtained showed that PMC79 decreases the viability of yeasts expressing hotspot KRAS 627 mutations and not in yeast expressing KRASwt but only inhibiting KRAS expression 628 levels in cells harboring those mutations. This result also proves that the KRAS-629 humanized yeast model is an excellent tool for studying the effect of new drugs on KRAS 630 mutations. 631 Overall, PMC79 results in the CRC-derived cell lines and in the KRAS-632 humanized yeast model suggest that PMC79 is selective for mutated KRAS. In the case 633 of yeast strains expressing KRASwt protein, the cells seem to be more resistant to PMC79 634 and do not affect KRASwt protein expression. These results suggest that the mechanism 635 of action of PMC79 might be related to the structural conformation of the mutated protein 636 that might be more available for the binding of the compound and thus allow the 637 inhibition of the mutated protein. 638 Taking into consideration the effect of PMC79 on the specific inhibition of all 639 KRAS hotspot mutations, we decided to gather evidence on the mechanism by which 640 PMC79 might inhibit KRAS mutation activation and expression levels. 641 642 643 644 645 646 647 648 649 650\nyeast model with different CRC hotspot mutations and KRASwt after 4 h treatment with PMC79 at 250 \u00b5M, 655 PMC78 at 250 \u00b5M and adagrasib at 100 \u00b5M. The results were obtained from two independent experiments. 656 657 3.4 Molecular docking results 658 In an attempt to gather insights into the binding of PMC79 to wild-type KRAS 659 (WT) as well as G12X mutations (G12D, G12V), we used a combination of MD 660 simulations and molecular docking to hopefully build a tentative structural model for the 661 interaction. We explored possible binding near the P-loop region, responsible for binding 662 phosphate and regions near Switch-I and Switch-II regions that are not only responsible 663 for KRas/SOS1 and K-Ras/NF1 interactions92 but also provide a shallow pocket for 664 small-molecule binding93. These switch regions are typically disordered in 665 crystallographic structures and hence, the usage of X-ray structures as receptors for 666 docking studies would be pernicious. 667\nTo minimize the bias of the crystallographic structure and provide sampling of 668 these regions, we docked compound PMC79 into 180 conformations of each receptor 669 (WT, G12D, and G12V) and selected the lowest-energy binding poses according to Vina 670 and Vinardo scoring functions for further analysis. These are represented in Figure 4. 671 Apart from the WT, it appears to exist a relatively good consensus in the binding mode 672 provided by both scoring functions. Indeed, for G12D, PMC79 is located below Switch-673 II, with the cyclopentadienyl ligand pointing to the protein exterior while the phenyl 674 groups of the triphenylphosphine establish hydrophobic interaction with Switch-II. The 675 polar hydroxyl groups are hydrogen bonded to the side-chain of ASP69 (Vina) and 676 eventually to the main-chain oxygen and nitrogen atoms of GLN99 (Vinardo). No 677 interaction with ASP12 was observed, despite the presence of the polar hydroxyl groups 678 on the bipyridine ligand. In the lowest-energy binding poses of G12V, PMC79 binds 679 differently as the compound is now under Switch-II but with the one hydroxyl group 680 establishing hydrogen bonds with the main-chain oxygen of VAL8 (Vina and Vinardo) 681 near the P-loop, in a much close proximity to the mutated residue of interest (VAL12), 682 though no specific interaction is observed with the latter. This close interaction under 683 Switch-II along with a close proximity with the P-loop might explain the larger activity 684 of PMC79 against this mutant. 685 For the interaction with the wild-type, consensus was not observed in the binding 686 mode. Vina scoring function indicates that PMC79 sits between both switch regions, with 687 cyclopentadienyl and triphenylphosphine directed towards the protein exterior while 688 hydrogen bonds are established with the side-chain of ASP57. On the other hand, using 689 Vinardo scoring, the compound is also located sits between both switch regions but 690 rotated, with hydrogen bonds with TYR40 and GLY37 (Switch-I). 691\nIf one takes into consideration the actual scores of the binding poses, Vina predicts 692 G12V > WT > G12D while for Vinardo the order is WT > G12V > G12D. Both docking 693 scoring functions failed to predict the observed activity though Vina was able to order 694 G12V as the best mutant for PMC79 binding as per experimental results. This difficulty 695 in predicting the correct order is, besides the inherent problems of docking scoring 696 functions94, also largely due to the fact that KRAS dynamics is particularly challenging 697 to tackle, and that phenomenon is paramount for ligand binding. In our poses with G12V, 698 the PMC79 ligand is much closer to the GDP site and that is only possible on a sampled 699 protein conformation where the P-loop approaches the Switch-II region in some extent. 700 Indeed, long MD simulations indicated that G12D mutants possess a closer dynamics to 701 the wild-type than G12V95. Therefore, our results suggest that the specific activity of 702 PMC79 towards G12V, which is reduced in G12D and absent in the wild-type, is not due 703 to a specific interaction of the compound with the G12X mutation, as this kind of 704 interactions was not found, but rather due to changes in the protein dynamics which are 705 mutation specific and were previously shown to affect allosteric communication 706 networks95, eventually enabling the binding in G12V (and to a lesser extent G12D) while 707 hindering the interaction with WT. Such change of the protein dynamics upon mutation 708 was also observed for G1396 and Q61 mutants97. The complexity of this mechanism 709 deserves further studies, beyond the limitations of molecular docking, but are however 710 out of the scope of this manuscript. 711 712 713 714 715 716\nVina Vinardo\nWT\n-8.3 kcal mol-1 -6.4 kcal mol-1\nG12D\n-7.7 kcal mol-1 -6.1 kcal mol-1\nG12V\n-8.7 kcal mol-1 -6.2 kcal mol-1\nFigure 4.

The remainder details as in Figure S1. 719\n720 3.5 KRAS inhibition by PMC79 is not dependent on actin polymerization or on 721 proteasome 722\nActin cytoskeleton is known to be responsible for KRAS clustering and 723 localization at the cell membrane through the formation of KRAS nanoclusters with the 724 inner leaflet of the plasma membrane which is important for KRAS signal transduction98. 725 Our previous results showed that PMC79 interferes with actin cytoskeleton in CRC cell 726 lines leading to alterations in cell-cell adhesion and intercellular contact establishment, 727 inducing changes in cell phenotype and roundness and reducing the expression levels of 728 \u00df-actin46,47. Therefore, to prove if the inhibition of KRAS expression by PMC79 might 729 be dependent on actin filament\u2019s function, we studied the influence of latrunculin A, an 730 actin polymerization inhibitor on the effect of PMC79. We performed a phalloidin 731 staining and as already described before, PMC79 affects cell-cell adhesion and 732 intercellular contact establishment and induces changes in cell phenotype and 733 roundness46,47 (Figure 5a). Concerning latrunculin A it also leads to actin structure 734 alterations consistent with depolymerization of actin and when combined with PMC79 735 similar actin phenotype was observed, with evident changes in cell phenotype similar to 736 PMC79 alone (Figure 5a). 737 Our results on the analysis of KRAS expression levels showed that PMC79 738 inhibits KRAS expression even in the presence of latrunculin A, indicating that KRAS 739 expression inhibition by PMC79 is not an indirect effect that this compound has on the 740 actin cytoskeleton and thus is not dependent on the actin structure at the cell (Figure 5b). 741\nIn order to understand the reason why PMC79 leads to a decrease in the expression 742 levels of mutated KRAS, we hypothesized that PMC79 could target mutated KRAS to 743 proteasomal degradation. The proteasome is a multiprotein cellular complex that 744 regulates most proteins and in consequence several cellular processes with high 745 importance for carcinogenesis such as proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis and 746 motility/metastasis99. CRC is not an exception with several pathways, such as Wnt and 747 KRAS pathways, that play important roles in carcinogenesis being regulated by the 748 proteasome complex100. Some studies already reported that KRAS and KRAS 749 downstream signaling molecules are regulated and consequently degraded by proteasome 750 101\u2013103. This strategy is one of the approaches used that can directly target KRAS and 751 recently, the natural product, Kurarinone, showed to reduce KRAS protein levels in CRC 752 cells, through proteasomal degradation dependent on an E3 ubiquitin ligase WDR76103. 753 Thus, to assess whether the inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway restores 754 KRAS expression after PMC79 treatment, we used a well-known proteasome inhibitor, 755 MG132. PMC79 effect on the KRAS half-life showed this compound begins to decrease 756 KRAS expression after 8 h of treatment (Figure S4). Therefore, MG132 was pre-757 incubated with SW480KRASG12V cells for 1 h and then co-incubated with PMC79 for 758 additional 8 h and 12 h. The results showed that even in the presence of MG132, PMC79 759 keeps decreasing the expression of KRAS, suggesting that KRAS inhibition by PMC79 760 is independent of proteasomal degradation (Figure 5c). 761 Summing up, in the present study, we showed that PMC79 inhibits specifically 762 KRAS hotspot G12V and G12D mutations expression and interferes with ERK, AKT 763 phosphorylation and expression in CRC cells. We demonstrated that at least in CRC cells 764 harboring KRASG12V mutation PMC79 impairs KRAS-GTP binding and consequent 765 activation. 766\nUsing the KRAS-humanized yeast model we could also observe that PMC79 767 might also interfere with KRASG13D mutation expression. PMC79 does not interfere with 768 KRAS wild-type both in CRC cells or KRAS-humanized yeast model. 769 In order to try to understand the possible mechanism of action of PMC79 that 770 could explain the specific inhibitory effect of PMC79 on KRAS hotspot mutations and 771 downstream signaling pathways, here we explored some processes implicated in the 772 regulation of protein expression and activation. Molecular docking study did not find any 773 interaction of the compound with mutated KRAS but did not exclude the possibility of 774 some interaction due to changes in the protein dynamics which are mutation specific. The 775 results gathered here suggest that it might be the protein dynamics associated with the 776 mutations that can be responsible for the specific effect of PMC79 in KRAS hotspot 777 mutations. Moreover, our results also suggest that PMC79 seems to inhibit KRAS protein 778 expression levels independently of actin cytoskeleton and proteasome. 779\nFU alone and in combination with PMC79 at 15.8 \u03bcM.

For that matter, we tested the combination 798 of PMC79 with 5-FU a classical chemotherapeutic drug to compare their anticancer effect 799 and explore the combination of the two drugs as a new therapeutic approach. 800 5-FU is the conventional chemotherapeutic drug used in the treatment of CRC 801 blocking DNA replication however, it is associated with low success rates, many side 802 effects and resistance problems104. Previous results from our group already showed that 803 PMC79 induces several phenotypic alterations in hallmarks of CRC with KRAS 804 mutation, namely decreases proliferation and induces cell cycle arrest, decreases colony 805 formation, induces apoptosis and necrosis and reduces motility of SW480KRASG12V cells46. 806 We tested the effect of different concentrations of PMC79 and 5-FU alone and in 807 combination to study their effect on SW480KRASG12V cells viability. Almost all 808 combinations decrease cell viability compared with the same dose of 5-FU alone (Figure 809\n5d). However, only the combination of the lower dose of the two agents (5-FU 2.2 M + 810\nPMC79 15.8 M) led to a significant decrease in cell viability regarding the same 811\nconcentrations of PMC79 and 5-FU alone. 812\nTo confirm that the lowest concentration of PMC79 (15.8 M) potentiates 5-FU 813\nanticancer effects, the dose-response curves of 5-FU alone and in combination with 814\nPMC79 were determined. The results show that the combination of 5-FU with PMC79 815 strongly inhibits cell growth at the lowest doses of 5-FU, reducing cell growth by half 816 (Figure 5e). In addition, 5-FU half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) reduced 817\ndrastically in combination with PMC79, from 73.5 M to 0.02 M (Table S7). 818\nThese promising results indicate that low doses of PMC79 potentiate 5-FU 819 anticancer effects in a CRC cell line with KRAS mutation. 820 Several studies have shown that combining 5-FU with other therapeutic agents 821 increases treatment success rates in addition to decreasing side effects since lower doses 822 of each agent are required104. Our data open the possibility of using PMC79 in 823 combination with 5-FU as a new therapeutic approach in CRC with KRAS mutations 824 targeting specifically mutated KRAS, interfering with ERK, and AKT pathways while 825 blocking DNA replication of these cells. 826 827 3.7 PMC79 reduces tumor growth in the \u201cin vivo\u201d CRC chick embryo 828 chorioallantoic membrane- xenograft 829\nIn order to do an \u201cin vivo\u201d \u201cproof of concept\u201d we performed pre-clinical trials 830 using two different complementary models, the chick embryo CAM model and the CRC-831 mice xenografted model. 832 Previous \u201cin vitro\u201d results showed that PMC79 presents good anticancer activity 833 against the CRC cell line SW480 with KRASG12V mutation46 besides inhibiting KRAS 834 expression. Therefore, we evaluated the \u201cin vivo\u201d anticancer effects of PMC79 using the 835 chick embryo CAM-SW480 xenograft assay. 836 SW480 cells grew in CAM from day 9 to day 13 when tumor xenografts were 837 exposed to different treatments for 4 days. In the end, tumor growth was determined 838 through the area difference between day 13 and day 17. The results showed the highest 839\ndose of PMC79 (40.0 M) showed a decrease in the tumor area and the dose of 73.5 M 840\nof 5-FU demonstrated a tendency towards a decrease in the tumor area. The lower doses 841\nof PMC79 (25.0 M) and of 5-FU (12.6 M) have no effect on the tumor area (Figures 842\n6a and 6b). 843 Concerning the percentage of blood vessel area around the tumor no alterations 844 were observed for any of the drugs (Figure 6c). These results showed that PMC79 reduces 845 significantly the tumor area in the chick embryo CAM assay not affecting angiogenesis. 846 The chick embryo CAM-xenograft is a cost-effective and valuable alternative 847 method to study the anticancer effect of drugs with several advantages over the xenograft 848 mice model such as easy access for manipulation, shorter experimental times, 849 physiological environment and reproducibility, and natural immunodeficient model 850 which accept cancer cells regardless of their origin without immune response105,106. This 851 data on PMC79 is a preliminary \u201cproof of concept\u201d that the compound might have a 852 valuable anticancer effect by reducing the xenograft of CRC in chick embryo CAM \u201cin 853 vivo\u201d. 854\n862 863 864 865 866\n3.8 PMC79 anticancer effect in the \u201cin vivo\u201d colorectal cancer xenograft mice 867 model 868\nThis study aimed to use an \u201cin vivo\u201d xenograft mice model to corroborate the \u201cin 869 vivo\u201d results on chick embryo CAM-CRC xenograft and also to confirm \u201cin vivo\u201d the 870 effect of PMC79 in significantly decreasing KRASG12V expression in SW480 cells. For 871 that matter, we used N:NIH(S)II-nu/nu mice in which SW480 cells harboring KRASG12V 872 mutation were injected in the back of the mice in order to produce tumor xenografts. 873 874 3.8.1 Toxicity assay 875 To set the maximum tolerated dose of PMC79 in N:NIH(S)II-nu/nu mice, we first 876 performed a dose escalation experiment. For this, the following doses of PMC79 were 877 tested: 34 mg/Kg, 26 mg/Kg, 17 mg/Kg, 13 mg/Kg and 8.7 mg/Kg (n=4 mice per group, 878 except in the last one where n=2). The 34 mg/Kg dose was found to be lethal. The 26 879 mg/Kg dose is not advised because it caused 75% of lethality after the first injection. In 880 general, the injection of PMC79 causes abdominal discomfort and agitation followed by 881 apathy, being these effects dose-dependent. Body weight loss was also found to be dose-882 dependent. Despite these effects, a drug habitation of the animals to PMC79 seems to 883 occur because after several injections the reaction of the animals is not as severe as in the 884 first injection and their weight also increases (Figure 7a). The 17 mg/Kg dose was 885 established as well tolerated by the animals and as such, this dose was selected to be used 886 in the evaluation of the antitumor ability of PMC79. 887 From the histological analysis, it was possible to verify that there are two mainly 888 relevant effects that can be associated with the toxicity of the compound (Figure S5). Of 889 the 10 mice administered with PMC79, 5 of them had hemorrhaged lungs, with a 890 correlation between the development of pulmonary hemorrhage and the administered 891\ndose of PMC79. In contrast, no bleeding was observed in control mice. These 892 hemorrhages can be derived from a pulmonary alteration that is caused by the 893 administration of PMC79 which can cause the destruction of vessels associated with the 894 spasms/shock situations that the animals present right after the injection. Beyond the 895 hemorrhaged lungs, all animals, including controls showed peripancreatic inflammatory 896 infiltrate, a normal reaction resulting from the IP injections. There was a tendency for 897 more severe peritonitis in mice treated with PMC79 and this toxicity correlates with the 898 administered dose. 899 To further confirm PMC79 safety, we measured several hematochemical 900 parameters (urea, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate 901 aminotransferase (AST)) at the end of the study (Table S8). No significant changes were 902 observed between the treated and control Groups. As such we can conclude that PMC79 903 did not induce biochemical changes in the blood, at least for these biochemical markers. 904 905 3.8.2. \u201cIn vivo\u201d antitumor activity in a CRC xenograft mice model 906\nN:NIH(S)II-nu/nu mice with SW480 cells tumor xenografts were treated with 907 PMC79 at the established dose of 17 mg/Kg. As shown in Figure 7b, a treatment dose of 908 17 mg/Kg PMC79 or vehicle leads to weight loss after the first treatment, yet afterward 909 the tendency is to increase weight. Indeed, all animals recovered or increased their initial 910 weight in relation to the first day of treatment. 911 Concerning the effect of PMC79 in tumor growth, on the conditions of this study 912 no differences were found between tumor volumes of PMC79 treated and control groups 913 (Figure 7c). 914 After the excision of the tumors, a sample was fixed in 10% buffered formalin and 915 a histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis was carried out. Tumor samples 916\nwere compared with those of control mice and the histological variables analyzed, namely 917 necrosis, intratumoral hemorrhage, lymphocytic infiltration, peritumoral oedema, as well 918 as the degree of tumor regression were evaluated. The number of mitoses was quantified 919 as well. In general, there are no differences between the group treated with PMC79 and 920 its control, being the cellular proliferative index Ki-67 very high in all cases (data not 921 shown). Interestingly the percentage of necrotic area within the tumor is much higher in 922 tumors treated with PMC79 compared with untreated controls (Figure 7d). 923 Although the percentage of necrosis for each tumor is merely indicative, the 924 difference between treated and control tumors is remarkable as the animals treated with 925 PMC79 presented tumors with a larger necrotic area compared to the controls. This result 926 is in fact interesting because, although there were no differences in tumor growth between 927 treated and control groups, PMC79 caused the death of tumor cells. This is a fact that 928 corroborates the results obtained in vitro in which it was observed cell death of SW480 929 cells by apoptosis and also necrosis when exposed to PMC7946. 930 In order to infer about possible cancer recurrence and/or the appearance of 931 metastases, we surgically removed the tumors and kept the mice until 67 days after tumors 932 inoculations and 35 days after removal of the last tumors. At this date, all animals were 933 apparently in good health. When carrying out the necropsy of the animals treated with 934 PMC79 and controls, lungs and lymph nodes (4 submandibular, 4 axillary and 2 inguinal) 935 were collected, to search for micrometastases. After histological analysis, it was possible 936 to verify that none of the mice had evident signs of metastatic invasion in the organs 937 analyzed. 938 939 940 941\n3.9.3. Western blot analysis of KRAS signaling pathways 942\nAfter the excision of the tumors, we performed protein extraction and analyzed 943 the expression of KRAS and downstream signaling pathways AKT and ERK proteins by 944 Western blot. As shown in Figure 7e, PMC79 was able to inhibit the expression of KRAS, 945 ERK, p-ERK, AKT and p-AKT proteins. The results in the \u201cin vivo\u201d mice model-CRC 946 xenograft corroborated the \u201cin vitro\u201d results in SW480KRASG12V cells showing that 947 PMC79 \u201cin vivo\u201d was also able to inhibit the expression levels of mutated KRAS and the 948 downstream proteins ERK and AKT. Overall, these results highlight the therapeutic 949 potential of PMC79 for the treatment of patients with CRC harboring KRAS mutations 950 inhibiting at the same time KRAS, and ERK and AKT signaling molecules. 951\n(e) Results obtained from Western blot analysis to evaluate the expression of KRAS, p-AKT, AKT, p-ERK, 963 and ERK proteins. 964 965 4. Conclusion 966\nKRAS was considered \u201cundruggable\u201d for a long time. After decades of efforts, 967 this paradigm has begun to change with several inhibitors being discovered and two 968 already being used in the clinic for NSCLC treatment. The difficulties in finding new 969 agents that inhibit this molecule are related to its conformational dynamics that are 970 different from mutation to mutation, which limits the application in different KRAS 971 hotspot mutations. KRASG12C inhibitors have been the most explored so far. However, 972 this mutation is only present in 3% of CRCs with KRAS mutation. KRAS-activating 973 mutations are the most frequent oncogenic alterations in CRC, but the therapeutic options 974 in these types of cancers are scarce3. To the best of our knowledge, so far, no KRAS 975 inhibitors for CRC treatment have been accepted in the clinics. 976 In this work, we discovered for the first time a new ruthenium-derived 977 organometallic agent, PMC79, able to inhibit specifically the expression of various 978 KRAS hotspot mutations in several CRC-derived cells, in KRAS mutated-humanized 979 yeast model and in CRC-xenograft mice \u201cin vivo\u201d model. Moreover, PMC79 also inhibits 980 the expression of KRAS downstream signaling molecules ERK and AKT in CRC cells 981 harboring hotspot mutations. Kinase activity results in CRC cells also demonstrated that 982 PMC79 inhibits KRAS activation. The molecular docking study suggests that the protein 983 dynamics associated with the mutations might be responsible for the specific effect of 984 PMC79 in KRAS hotspot mutations. We also demonstrated that KRAS inhibition by 985 PMC79 is not dependent on actin polymerization or on the proteasome. Importantly, we 986 showed that low doses of PMC79 potentiate 5-FU anticancer effects in a CRC cell line 987\nwith KRAS mutation, which open the possibility of using PMC79 in combination with 5-988 FU as a new therapeutic approach in CRC with KRAS mutations. 989 Here, we performed a \u201cproof of concept\u201d for the anticancer effect of PMC79 \u201cin 990 vivo\u201d showing that in the chick embryo CAM-xenograft model, PMC79 reduced tumor 991 growth and in the xenograft mice model PMC79 induced necrosis of the tumor and 992 decreased the expression levels of KRAS, AKT and ERK proteins. 993 Taken together, our findings highlight the discovery of the first Ru-derived 994 organometallic compound, PMC79, as a specific KRAS mutated inhibitor in CRC with 995 KRAS mutations. This discovery opens the possibility to study the effects of the 996 compound in other human cancer types also presenting these KRAS mutations. 997 In this work, we discovered a new compound, PMC79, that specifically inhibits 998 KRAS and both KRAS signaling pathways (MAPK and PI3K) in cells harboring KRAS 999 mutation but not in cells with KRAS wild-type. This simultaneous inhibition of MAPK 1000 and PI3K pathways is an advantage over the above inhibitors and may prevent potential 1001 resistance problems in the future. 1002 Overall, the results gathered here show a promising therapeutic application of 1003 PMC79, supporting the use of this compound as a new specific and potent KRAS 1004 signaling inhibitor agent in CRC harboring KRAS hotspot mutations. 1005 1006 1007 1008 1009 1010 Conflicts of interest 1011 The authors declare no conflict of interest. 1012 1013\nFunding 1014 Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e a Tecnologia (FCT), Portugal for grants UIDB/04050/2020 1015 (CBMA), UIDB/04046/2020-UIDP/04046/2020 (BioISI), UIDB/00100/2020 and 1016 UIDP/00100/2020 (Centro de Qu\u00edmica Estrutural), LA/P/0056/2020 (Institute of 1017 Molecular Sciences) and PTDC/QUI-QIN/28662/2017.
