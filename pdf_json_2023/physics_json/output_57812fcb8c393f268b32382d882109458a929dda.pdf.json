When sites for anions are instead pre-programmed, they have the potential to\nbe used as orthogonal elements to build up structure in a predictable andmodular way. We explore this idea by combining cation (M+) and anion (X\u2212) binding sites together and show the orthogonal and modular build\nup of structure in a multi-ion assembly. Cation binding is based on a ligand (L) made by subcomponent metal-imine chemistry (M+ = Cu+, Au+) while the site for anion binding (X\u2212 = BF4 \u2212, ClO4 \u2212) derives from the inner cavity of cyanostar (CS) macrocycles. The two sites are connected by imine condensation between a pyridyl-aldehyde and an aniline-modified cyanostar. The target assembly [LM-CS-X-CS-ML],+\ngenerates two terminal metal complexation sites (LM and ML) with one central anion-bridging site (X)\ndefined by cyanostar dimerization. We showcase modular assembly by isolating intermediates when the primary structure-directing ions are paired with weakly coordinating counter ions. Cation-directed (Cu+) or anion-bridged (BF4 \u2212) intermediates can be isolated along either cation\u2013anion or anion\u2013cation pathways. Different products can also be prepared in a modular way using Au+ and ClO4 \u2212. This is also the first use of gold(I) in subcomponent self-assembly.

The anions have only rarely been explored as orthogonal motifs for building up structural features in a manner that matches metal ions. A notable exception16 from Jansone-Popova is the synergistic onepot self-assembly of a helicate around divalent metal cations, (Cu2+) and sulfate anions (SO4\n2\u2212) all directed by heteroditopic ligands composed of separate cation and anion binding sites. Herein, we investigate the orthogonality between anion coordination chemistry17,18 and cation coordination for the modular build-up of ion-driven assemblies (Fig. 1).\nThe realization of structure-directing anion coordination is enabled by advances in receptor design.19\u201323 Examples include anion helicates24 with ditopic ligands bearing terminal ureas wrapped around phosphate (PO4\n3\u2212).25 Cages,26 e.g., tetrahedra, have combined urea motifs with highly charged phosphates in the vertices.27 Polymers have been developed, e.g., the Texassized box electrostatically stabilizes the polymerization of terephthalates,28 and cyanostar stabilizes polymerization of diphosphonates29 or diphosphates.30 The counter cations in these cases, once again, play secondary roles.\nExamples of multi-ion assemblies with anions and cations serving as equal partners are under-represented.31\u201335 Ion-pair\nChem.

When cation and anion do not interact either with each other or the other's binding sites then the assembly should be pre-programmable in a predictable way. Orthogonality also lends modularity. Thus, swapping one type of anion for another alters the composition but not the structural features of the nal assembly. These characteristics of predictability and modularity can potentially be demonstrated by separating a one-pot multi-component selfassembly (Fig. 1a) into discrete steps (Fig. 1b).\nHerein, we explore the orthogonality and modularity of iondriven assembly by combining cation-directed subcomponent self-assembly between imines and metal moieties42 (ML; L = POP, PPh3; Fig. 2b) with pre-programmed anion binding sites (Fig. 2).41 We use cyanostar macrocycles (CS, Fig. 2c)22 for strong anion coordination (X\u2212, Fig. 2a). Structure-directing cations (M= Cu+, Au+; Fig. 2b) and anions (X\u2212 = BF4 \u2212, ClO4 \u2212; Fig. 2a) can be added to form target assemblies in one-pot conrming the orthogonality of assembly. Modularity is demonstrated by rst isolating supramolecular intermediates of either ion (Fig. 1b). The intermediates are accessed by using non-coordinating counterions (Fig. 2d and e).

Exemplary studies with copper(I) and tetrauoroborate indicate the intermediate can be used as a substrate for a second coordination step to form the nal assembly [LCu-CS-BF4-CS-CuL], + (Fig. 1b). Modularity was also demonstrated using Au+ and ClO4 \u2212 ions. Surprisingly, this is the rst example of subcomponent selfassembly43 with Au(I). We used other anions (phosphates, phosphonates, bisulfate) to explore the limits of this strategy. Thus, pre-programmed cation and anion binding sites serve as orthogonal interactions that form supramolecular assemblies and help contribute to the growing exploration of methods44,45 capable of orthogonal, modular noncovalent synthesis."

            "text": "Design of the components used in cation\u2013anion self-assembly\nIn order to demonstrate orthogonality, we needed to simplify the number of potential products that form. We used ancillary ligands on the metals to block the possibility of cross linking. We substituted just one of the ve cyanostar arms (Fig. 1a) to enable coordination of one metal ion moiety to the macrocycle as opposed to ve in the C5-symmetric cyanostar. The only drawback to mono-substitution is the presence of overlapping peaks in the NMR spectra. These ligand and receptor features all favor formation of fewer species.\nWe used knowledge of the recognition patterns of the binding sites to design the various components.42 The monosubstituted cyanostar46 (NH2-CS, Fig. 1) contains a 4-aminophenyl group. We expect this aniline to enable imine formation upon reaction with aldehydes in the presence of metal ions.43 We also anticipate anion coordination with NH2-CS will match the behavior of parent cyanostar (pCS)22 to direct formation of a 2 : 1 sandwich complex with a bridging anion, X\u2212. For metal complexation, we selected a uoro-substituted picolinaldehyde, F-PyCHO, as the partner to the NH2-CS aniline for subcomponent assembly.\nWe identied two metal precursors to explore modularity. The copper(I) complex of bis(2-(diphenylphosphino)phenyl) ether (POP) as the bis-acetonitrile solvato species, {POPCu(MeCN)2}\n+, was selected as the rst. The POP ligand is known to terminate the assembly aer imine coordination42 and the acetonitrile is labile. The second is a gold(I) triphenylphosphine moiety, {PPh3Au}\n+. Gold(I) has never been used in subcomponent self-assembly and it has unique coordination geometries.47 Gold(I) is typically two coordinate,48 but three has also been observed when using s-donors of comparable strength.49 The imine nitrogen is a relatively strong donor,50 therefore a two-coordinate geometry is possible. Alternatively, the chelating imine is similar to phenanthroline that can favor three-coordinate geometries with gold(I).51 A model gold(I) complex was examined to conrm the preferred mode of coordination prior to the cation\u2013anion self-assembly."

The cyanostar component has an anion-binding site native to its cavity and one cation binding site added to its exterior. Based on their preferred reactivity,22,42 these sites do not compete with each other. The second criterion requires knowledge of ion coordination and ion pairing. Copper(I) ions are known to coordinate with free imines while BF4\n\u2212 is complementary to the cyanostar. These ions (Cu+ and BF4\n\u2212) do not display strong interactions with each other in the solvents we use here.52 While BF4\n\u2212 anions are considered weakly coordinating to metals, they display some of the strongest binding affinities to cyanostar.22 But not all anions that bind tightly to cyanostar are inert to metal coordination (see below). These design principles are anticipated to be transferrable to other pairs of ions. To this end, we investigated gold(I), Au+, and perchlorate, ClO4\n\u2212 to verify the generality of this assembly strategy.\nFinally, isolation of intermediates requires selection of nonbinding counter ions. Their use enables structure-directing ions to be delivered separately and sequentially. Bulky anions tetrakis(3,5-bis(triuoromethyl)phenyl)borate (BArF4\n\u2212, Fig. 2d) and triimide (NTf2\n\u2212, Fig. 2d) fulll the requirements for weak counter anions. They are well-established to coordinate poorly to both metal ions53,54 and cyanostar.55 NTf2\n\u2212 has a low affinity (250 \u00b1 30 M\u22121) for cyanostar.52 Similarly, the TBA+ counter cation (tetrabutylammonium, Fig. 2e) is not known to coordinate to metal-binding ligands. While the ion pairing of TBA+ in dichloromethane with our target anions, e.g. BF4\n\u2212 log K = 4.6 (ref. 56) and ClO4\n\u2212 log K = 4.24 (ref. 57) is not negligible, they are weaker than the coordination with parent cyanostar, e.g., log b(pCS-ClO4\n\u2212-pCS) \u223c12.22 Thus, any ion pairing does not interfere.\nOne-pot, multi-component self-assembly using Cu+coordination and cyanostar-BF4 \u2212 binding\nOrthogonality between the two binding sites was veried using a traditional one-pot assembly. The structure-directing Cu+ and BF4\n\u2212 ions can be added as a single precursor (Fig. 3a). The target assembly [POPCu-CS-BF4-CS-CuPOP]\n+, is a dicopper and anionbridged dimer. The copper binding sites are products of imine condensation between NH2CS and F-PyCHO in the presence of the salt [POPCu(MeCN)2]$BF4. Mixtures of the three components proceed near-quantitatively through to the target assembly. The product was isolated as a BF4\n\u2212 salt aer solvent removal. Exploration of the assembly conditions revealed that excess aldehyde enhanced the yield and unreacted aldehyde could be removed with ether washes. Excess NH2CS was not investigated on account of its poorer solubility relative to the aldehyde.\nProduct identity was conrmed using NMR spectroscopy and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The wellresolved 1H NMR peaks (Fig. 3b) indicate high-delity Cu(I)complexation and BF4\n\u2212 binding in the target assembly. Diffusion ordered spectroscopy (DOSY, Fig. 3b) veried formation of a single monodisperse species. ESI-MS shows the peak for the parent assembly [POPCu-CS-BF4-CS-CuPOP]\n+ at 3407.2455 m/z (Fig. 3c).

In the cases where more than one counter anion is present, they are in exchange with the various species present in solution. For example, the 19F NMR spectrum of the gold assembly obtained via the cation\u2013anion pathway shows two peaks. One results from BF4\n\u2212 in fast exchange between being its cyanostar-bound and unbound states while the other corresponds to the uncomplexed NTf2 \u2212 anion (Fig. S30\u2020)."

Therein, the phosphine ligands are close enough to lower their symmetry into two different environments (Ho, Fig. 10). Molecular models on the syn geometry how one of the two phenyls engaging in p stacking. These ndings suggest the syn geometry is favored by stabilizing contacts between coordinated POP ligands.\nUse of gold(I) showcases modularity of cation-directed supramolecular intermediates\nGold(I) was used to investigate the modularity of assembly. To model the rst use of gold(I) ions in subcomponent selfassembly, we prepared a complex using a simple aniline. We mixed a gold(I) precursor as a triimide salt, [PPh3Au]$NTf2 with F-PyCHO and the aniline p-toluidine. X-ray diffraction studies showed formation of tricoordinate gold(I) cation (Fig. 11) with\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\na chelating imine. 1H and 19F NMR, and ESI-MS spectra (Fig. S36\u2013S38\u2020), are consistent with formation of the gold(I) complex seen in the solid state.\nWe examined the various synthetic pathways using the Au+\nand BF4 \u2212 ions. The target complex [PPh3Au-CS-BF4-CS-AuPPh3] + was formed along both one-pot and cation\u2013anion pathways (Fig. 12a). Formation was conrmed by ESI-MS with the one-pot producing a peak at 3122.1669 m/z (Fig. S25\u2020) matching the product of cation\u2013anion assembly (Fig. 12b). Consistent with gold(I) complexes being less stable than copper(I), parent ion peaks have lower intensity than daughter ions.\nFormation of the target assembly [PPh3Au-CS-BF4-CSAuPPh3]\n+, was veried by NMR. All resonances display the same diffusion coefficients (Fig. 12c) for the one-pot and cation\u2013 anion assembly (Fig. S69\u2020) and the same diagnostic peaks by 1H-NMR (Fig. 13) and 19F-NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S27\u2020). These similarities indicate that the same assembly is being produced along different pathways.\nThe anion\u2013cation stepwise pathway was also investigated. Using the anion-linked intermediate described earlier, addition of the Au+ precursor produced an 1H NMR spectrum differing from the one-pot and cation\u2013anion pathways (Fig. S56\u2020). The ESI-MS did not show any peaks consistent with target assembly. Adding excess BF4\n\u2212 to better match the one-pot pathway did not inuence the outcome (Fig. S41\u2020). Failure to access the target assembly by the alternative stepwise pathway is surprising and highlights the need to study the impacts of reaction order on multi-component supramolecular assemblies.\nFailure modes using competitive anions\nNot every anion that binds tightly to cyanostar29,57,60,61 is also weakly coordinating to metal cations. We were hoping to leverage this idea to target assemblies that could only be produced by pre-complexation of the anion. To explore this idea, we studied how metal complexes survived in the presence of organophosphates, which are known to ligate metals. These phosphates are also known to form threaded pseudorotaxane complexes with cyanostar.62 This study was undertaken using gold and copper complexes, dibutyl phosphate, dibenzyl phosphate, and the parent cyanostar, pCS, as models. However, precomplexation with cyanostar did not prevent the phosphates from decomposing the copper complexes in 24 hours (Fig. S71\u2013 S75\u2020). A gold complex showed similar behavior (Fig. S76 and S77\u2020) as did the cationic intermediate [PPh3Au-CS]$NTf2 (Fig. S77\u2020). While we saw some evidence of a threaded pseudorotaxane, the 1H NMR spectra suggests that the phosphate binds to the gold ions in the complex as opposed to the cyanostar cavity (Fig. S71\u2020). In addition, the bisulfate (HSO4 \u2212)57,60 and n-hexylphosphonate (C6H13PO3H \u2212)29 anions that can drive cyanostar dimerization, behaved poorly and stripped copper ions off the complex (Fig. S71\u2013S75\u2020). An instantaneous loss of color was indicative of decomplexation.\nHence, testing the orthogonality of the ion interactions involved in the noncovalent bond forming reactions and verifying the compatibility of the ions with each other is a key step for successful implementation of ion-by-ion stepwise self-\nChem.

Sci., 2023, 14, 2585\u20132595\nmulti-component assemblies in a modular manner by using pre-programmed binding sites for both cations and anions. This orthogonal ion-by-ion strategy of subcomponent selfassembly enables similar structures to be accessed in a modular manner using common intermediates in both a onepot and stepwise way. The architectures involved Cu(I) and Au(I) complexes situated on the termini of the anion-driven cyanostar dimers form [POPCu-CS-X-CS-CuPOP]+ and [PPh3Au-CS-X-CSAuPPh3] +, where the bridging anion (X) can be either BF4 \u2212 or ClO4 \u2212. We nd that the noncovalent chemistries of anion and cation coordination can be readily paired with the covalent chemistry of sub-component self-assembly based on modular imine-based ligands. The combination of anion receptors with established ligands for metal complexation introduce a new approach to design architectures based on orthogonal cation\u2013 anion self-assembly."
