            "text": "Biomimetic reaction design provides ideal and direct solutions to synthetic problems. For example, heme iron centers are active sites in cytochrome P450 enzymes, playing a crucial role in oxygenation of arene-based xenobiotics including pharmaceutical drugs and simple hydrocarbons.1 In such arene oxygenation reactions by cytochrome P450, several investigations suggested the involvement of iron(IV)-oxo porphyrin pcation radicals (compound I) generated by heme iron centers and molecular oxygen or other oxidants.2 Since the heme iron center is capable of oxidizing various arenes, the biomimetic design of iron(IV)-oxo porphyrin p-cation radicals with various combinations of transition metals and ligands has been the focus of development.3 Among some putative reaction pathways, two reaction pathways A and B, are shown in Fig. 1A. In pathway A, which is the target of many biomimetic systems, the reaction starts with addition of an oxygen atom from the iron(IV)-oxo porphyrin p-cation radicals to an arene in a radical manner. The resultant radical s-complex undergoes intramolecular electron transfer followed by proton shi to form a phenol scaffold.

Subsequently, the intermediate reacts with the arene radical cation to produce a radical scomplex. In this reaction process, the iron(IV)-oxo porphyrin pcation radicals function as two equivalents of single electron oxidants and an oxygen atom source. While CYP450-mediated oxidation provides a powerful tool for C\u2013H oxygenation, the regioselectivity relies on the electronic nature of the arene substrates.\nInspired by these studies, we questioned whether we could mimic the functions of the iron(IV)-oxo porphyrin p-cation radicals with transition metal-free fragments and oxygenate the proximal position of an arene to achieve metal-free regioselective arene C\u2013H oxygenation. For this strategy, we developed a light-activated oxygenation auxiliary (LOA) for ortho-selective oxygenation of arenes (Fig. 1B). The LOA contains a carbonyl group which is excitable in the visible light region and is covalently introduced to the substrate. The carbonyl group is assumed to adopt a biradical state (Fig. 1B, top) or become an acceptor moiety (Fig. 1B, bottom) upon photoexcitation, whereupon it can oxidize a proximal arene substituent through O radical addition of the biradical state or single electron transfer followed by C\u2013O bond formation within the resultant radical ion pair. The biradical intermediate would then undergo rearomatization by single electron oxidation of the remaining carbon radical on the LOA group followed by a proton shi to lead to the oxygenated product. To make this hypothesis feasible, the requirements of the LOA are as follows: (1) must be excitable in the visible light region, (2) can stabilize the anion\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

While aliphatic and aromatic ketones require hazardous UV light for excitation,6 the 1,2- dicarbonyl structure allows for a red shi in the absorption wavelength.7 Furthermore, conjugation of a third-row heteroatom to the carbonyl group leads to a red shi in the absorption wavelength through interaction of a 3d orbital of the heteroatom and the p* orbital of the carbonyl group.8 This synergistic bathochromic effect might allow the LOA to be excited in the visible light region. Additionally, the synergistic electronwithdrawing natures of the carbonyl and phosphonium moieties would contribute to the stabilization of the anion generated by a second single electron oxidation of the arene radical.\nWith the above requirements in mind, we designed iron(IV)oxo porphyrin p-cation radicals mimic with an a-ketoacyl phosphonium LOA for ortho-selective oxygenation of anilines, providing a synthetic route to 2-aminophenol derivatives that are present in natural products and pharmaceutical drugs and materials.9 Conventionally, electrophilic peroxide reagents have been utilized for ortho-selective oxidation of anilines.10 However, these protocols suffer from moderate regioselectivity and low chemoselectivity.

While the less hindered PBu3 showed moderate reactivity, the reaction did not proceed at all with PtBu3, PMe3 and PPh3 (entries 2\u20135). No reactivity of these phosphines would be attributed to the inefficient formation of an acyl phosphonium species due to the steric hindrance and the low nucleophilicity. Amine nucleophiles, such as DMAP (4-dimethylaminopyridine) and DABCO (1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane), did not provide the product (entries 6 and 7). While PrCN and DCM were comparable with MeCN, other solvents exhibited lower reactivity than MeCN (entries 8\u201311). Control experiments revealed that both light irradiation and phosphine were necessary for this reaction (entries 12 and 13). This protocol permitted scale-up to 1.0 mmol without any modication of the reaction conditions (entry 14). In the conventional oxygenation of arene C\u2013H bonds, competing oxygenation of weak C(sp3)\u2013H bonds and overoxidation are problems. However, neither oxygenation of the methyl group on the nitrogen nor overoxidation were observed.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Anilines with alkyl substituents at the para and meta positions on the aromatic ring were tolerated (2b\u20132d). This transition-metal-free protocol was compatible with halogen substituents, which offer further functionalization by cross coupling (2e\u20132h). Electron-decient anilines ensured high yields (2i\u20132k). Although it was necessary to prolong the reaction time, electron-rich anilines were also applicable (2l and 2m).13 In the case of meta-substituted anilines, a mixture of regioisomers was produced (2n\u20132q).\nNext, the N-substituent groups on the anilines were evaluated. This protocol tolerated primary and secondary alkyl groups that contain weak C\u2013H bonds (2r\u20132t). Tetrahydroisoquinoline could be converted to the corresponding tricyclic compound in good yield (2u). Functional groups, such as ether, ester, olen, and cyano were compatible (2v\u20132y). Diphenylamine was also oxygenated with ortho- and monoselectivity under the standard reaction conditions (2z). We also isolated the phosphonium salt 2a\u2032 by use of tributylphosphine instead of tricyclohexylphosphine, and the structure could be conrmed by X-ray crystal structure analysis (see ESI\u2020).\nTo demonstrate the synthetic utility of this protocol, the derivatization of the obtained phosphonium salts was conducted. First, a one-pot derivatization of phosphonium salts 2 to 2-aminophenols 3 was examined (Fig. 3A). The phosphonium LOA was found to be removable by treatment with KOtBu andmCPBA followed by hydrolysis under acidic conditions. The entire process could be performed in a one-pot manner by simple combination, accomplishing the formal ortho-selective C\u2013H oxygenation of anilines. This one-pot protocol was applicable to representative anilines shown in Fig. 3A (3a\u20133z). The hydrolysis\nFig. 4 Mechanistic experiments.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nunder basic conditions is provided in the ESI.\u2020 Furthermore, the phosphonium salt 2a could lead to 2H-1,4-benzoxazin3(4H)-one derivatives through various dephosphorylative functionalizations (Fig. 3B). For example, the Wittig reaction between 2a and benzaldehyde afforded the corresponding trisubstituted alkene 4a in high yield. In the presence of tetrabutylammonium uoride (TBAF), 2a could react with electrophiles. Thus, dephosphorylative protonation of 2a with water occurred to give 2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one in quantitative yield. Dephosphorylative alkylation was also achieved by use of methyl acrylate or benzyl bromide. In this reaction, a uoride anion might convert the alkylphosphonium moiety to the corresponding carbanion equivalent through formation of a phosphorane moiety.14 We applied the one-pot protocol of LOApromoted oxygenation and dephosphorylative protonation to the synthesis of umioxazin (see ESI\u2020).15\nMechanistic experiments were performed to clarify the reaction mechanism. First, UV-vis absorption spectra of acyl chloride 1a-1 and a-ketoacyl phosphonium 1a-2 derived from N-methylaniline were measured (Fig. 4A). While the absorption band of 1a1 did not reach into the visible light region, that of 1a-2 extended to around 450 nm. Therefore, the bathochromic effect by the phosphonium moiety was experimentally conrmed. The HOMO and LUMO orbitals of 1a were evaluated using DFT calculations. Two conformational isomers were found and the HOMO and LUMO of the more stable one are shown (Fig. 4B). The HOMO is comprised of the p orbital of aniline and the n orbitals of the two carbonyl groups. Natural Transition Orbitals (NTO) analysis for the S1 transition reveal that distribution of the n orbital in the HONTO is emphasized. The LUMO and LUNTO are comprised of the p* orbitals of the two carbonyl groups. To elucidate the involvement of a triplet state, the reactions were tested in the\nChem.

Although the addition of O2 or azulene to the optimal reaction conditions diminished the product yield, the reactions were not completely inhibited. We tried to observe triplet species in the reaction by time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) at 80 K, however, no signals were observed. Currently, we do not have any reasonable explanations based on experimental proof for decrease of yields in the presence of triplet quenchers. Although we could not observe any triplet species, the involvement of triplet species could not be ruled out completely. We conducted the reaction using an asymmetric diarylamine substrate 1ywith phenyl and p-methoxyphenyl groups on the nitrogen atom (Fig. 4D). Aer running under the optimal conditions followed by dephosphorylative protonation, two oxygenated products 5y and 5y\u2032 were obtained. The 10 : 1 ratio indicated that C(sp2)\u2013O formation preferentially occurred on the simple phenyl group. In Siegel's previous report,16 the oxygen radical added preferentially to the electron-rich aromatic ring over the neutral one. This result and the observed low reactivity of 2l and 2m (Fig. 2) were not consistent with an oxygen radicalmediated process. Therefore, we postulated that the charge transfer from the aniline moiety to the a-ketoacyl phosphonium salt might be the major pathway in the excited state.17 To determine the origin of the hydrogen atom at the a-position of the phosphonium moiety of 2a, the reaction with o- and p-deuterated aniline 1a-D was carried out under standard conditions (Fig. 4E, le). The reaction proceeded to afford the deuterated product 2aD in high yield (71% D incorporation). The moderate D incorporation could be rationalized by the acidic nature of the hydrogen (Fig. 4E, right).\nBased on these experimental results, a plausible reaction mechanism is shown in Fig. 4F. Acyl phosphonium salt 1-2 formed from aniline 1, oxalyl chloride, and phosphine becomes excited by blue LED irradiation. In the singlet or triplet excited state of 1-2, intramolecular electron transfer from the aniline moiety to the a-ketoacyl phosphonium moiety occurs to generate the radical ion pair (A). The O anion of the resultant ketyl radical adds onto the ortho position of the aniline radical cation, resulting in the formation of the C(sp2)\u2013O bond (B). Intramolecular electron transfer generates a phosphonium ylide (C), which is converted to phosphonium salt 2 by a proton shi."

These results supported SET-involved pathway in the excited state over O radical addition-involved one. The related reference, seeK. Ohkubo, K. Hirose and S. Fukuzumi, Chem.\u2013Eur.

Siegel, Nature, 2013, 499, 192. 17 We estimated that the preferential formation of 5y over 5y\u2032\ncould be rationalized by the different rate of back electron transfer on the radical ion pair. Based on the mechanism involving charge transfer (Fig. 1B, bottom), single electron transfer from more electron rich p-anisole moiety to aketoacylphosphonim moiety preferentially occurs to form the radical ion. In the radical ion species, back electron transfer from a-ketoacylphosphonim radical anion to the p-anisole radical cation might be fast because the corresponding electron transfer would be placed in the vertex of Marcus\u2019s parabola. This is same phenomenon discussed in note 13. In contrast, back electron transfer from radical cations of phenyl ring would be slow enough to complete C\u2013O bond formation of the radical ion species. Therefore, 5y would be obtained as a major product.\nChem. Sci., 2023, 14, 10488\u201310493 | 10493"
