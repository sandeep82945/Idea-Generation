    "abstractText": "The recently introduced unified pH ( pH2 abs ) concept enables rigorous pH measurements in non-aqueous and mixed media while at the same time maintaining comparability to the conventional aqueous pH scale. However, its practical application is hindered by a shortage of reference pH2 abs values. In order to improve this situation, the European Metrology Research Project (EMPIR) UnipHied (\u201cRealisation of a UnipHied pH scale\u201d) launched an interlaboratory comparison among highly experienced electrochemistry expert laboratories to assign the first such reference pH2 abs values by adopting an extensive statistical treatment of the reported measurement data: to phosphate buffer in water\u2013ethanol mixture (50 wt% of ethanol) and ammonium formate buffer in pure ethanol. Two different measurement setups \u2014 one capable of being easily adopted in industrial applications \u2014 have been used to demonstrate the robustness of pH2 abs measurement. This is an important step towards wider adoption of the pH2 abs concept in practice, like liquid chromatography, biofuels analysis and electrocatalysis.",

Its measurement in purely aqueous solutions of limited ionic strength (I < 0.1\u00a0mol\u00a0 kg\u22121) is straightforward. pH can be traced back to an internationally accepted conventional reference procedure based on potentiometric\nmeasurement in a transference-free Harned cell and calculations based on the Debye-H\u00fcckel electrolyte solutions theory. [1]\nWhile pH is, in the majority of cases, measured in dilute aqueous solutions, measurements of pH in a broader range of systems (e.g. non-aqueous solutions) are becoming more and more important. One of the solvents attracting attention is ethanol, e.g. in industrial or analytical chemical applications dealing with biofuel acidity [2], lignocellulose deconstruction [3] and other green applications [4].Lisa Deleebeeck and Daniela Stoica left the corresponding affiliations.\n* Frank Bastkowski frank.bastkowski@ptb.de\n1 Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt, Bundesallee 100, 38116\u00a0Brunswick, Germany\n2 University of\u00a0Tartu, 14a Ravila Street, 50411\u00a0Tartu, Estonia 3 Electrochemistry Laboratory, Chemistry Group, The\nScientific and\u00a0Technological Research Council of\u00a0Turkey, National Metrology Institute, (TUBITAK UME), 41470\u00a0Gebze,\u00a0Kocaeli, Turkey\n4 Instituto Portugu\u00eas da Qualidade, R.

A need by the scientific community for an acidity parameter comparable across different media, as well as the corresponding simple and accessible measurement method, is evident in several fields \u2014 liquid chromatography, biofuels, and electrocatalysis, to name a few.\nThis comparability limitation has been overcome through the introduction of a unified pH scale of absolute pH values, pH H 2 O\nabs , and the development of a differential potentiometric measurement method [7, 8], which enables the comparison of pH values measured in different media. Furthermore, this allows pH values measured in diversified media to be expressed in terms of the familiar aqueous pH scale via the assessment of differential values, pHH2O\nabs [9]. Most of the\nwork on pHH2O abs has been done using a differential potentiometric method in a symmetric cell [10]. This measurement is rather demanding by requiring skills and using equipment not readily available at most labs.\nThus, besides reference values, a simple and accessible method for pHH2O\nabs measurement is very much needed. An\nattempt has been made by Matsubara [11, 12], who used an ISFET electrode and the aqueous Ag/AgCl reference electrode and still needed to account for the liquid junction potential. Maximum uncertainty of pHH2O\nabs of 0.37 in pH was\nreported for water\u2013dimethylformamide mixtures [11, 12]. A convenient potentiometric method using a conventional glass electrode and a double-junction reference electrode with ionic liquid (IL) in the outer compartment has been proposed [13, 14] but not yet sufficiently tested. In addition, there are still no reference pHH2O\nabs values available for non-\naqueous or mixed aqueous\u2013organic solutions. In this work, we present the results of an interlaboratory comparison that was used, on the one hand, to test the robustness of the simple pHH2O\nabs measurement method and, on the other hand,\nfor the assignment of reference pHH2O abs values to phosphate buffer in water\u2013ethanol mixture (50 wt% of ethanol) and to ammonium formate buffer in pure ethanol. These samples of different ethanol concentrations were chosen to cover different challenges related to pHH2O\nabs measurements."

The salts disodium hydrogen phosphate and potassium dihydrogen phosphate (both 15\u00a0mmol\u00a0 kg\u22121) were previously dissolved in water before the addition of ethanol (purity > 99.5%). Each lab used its own salts, which were dried for 2\u00a0h at 110\u00a0\u00b0C before use. The water content of the ethanol was determined by density measurement to ensure the 1:1 ratio of the solvents. To make easier the preparation of the buffer solution, all institutes used the same Excel sheet, which contained detailed instructions for the recipe, quality and treatment of the ingredients.\nThe formate buffer (10\u00a0mmol\u00a0 kg\u22121) was also prepared by gravimetry at each institute by dissolving the desired amount of ammonium formate in high-purity ethanol. Each lab used its own salt (purity > 99%) and commercial absolute ethanol (purity > 99.5%).\nEach participant (Table\u00a0S1) was responsible for ensuring the homogeneity of the bottled samples before opening. Additionally, any small remaining inhomogeneities were expected to induce pH changes far below the measurement uncertainty. However, to avoid any possible changes to the analysed solutions, i.e. solvent evaporation, participants were advised to perform the measurements with the buffers directly after preparation or to store the buffers under refrigeration. As unexpected deviations may result from samples being altered with time, the ages of the solutions at the measurement dates were collected and are given in Table\u00a0S2."

The measurement procedures are based on the same type of differential potentiometric cell design I (Fig.\u00a01, left) and are collectively referred to as the reference method:\npH glass electrode 2|solution 2|N 2225 NTf 2 |solution 1|pH glass electrode 1 I\nIn addition, an easier and more accessible alternative method was used. It consists of reproducing the desired system in 2 pieces: a single glass electrode and an external electrode with a double-junction Ag/AgCl electrode, the inner compartment filled with KCl solution to obtain a stable potential, and\nthe outer compartment filled with ionic liquid triethylpentylammonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [N2225][NTf2]. The electrodes are given in Table\u00a0S3 of the Supplementary material. The same method has been used in an additional study with saline solutions [14] and ethanol buffers [13]. The cell design (Fig.\u00a01, right) is\n1 3\nThe measurement steps with cell II are:\n1. Measurement of the difference of potential between the electrodes, \u0394E, in three standard aqueous buffers (except of lab 4 (two standards) and lab 6 (4 standards)) with known pH values, e.g. buffers with pH 4, 7 and 9. At least two buffers must be used. The number of calibration standards does not affect the quality of the calibration significantly with respect to the measurement uncertainty. Linear regression of pH vs. measured difference of potential gives the calibration results expressed as the slope and intercept for the glass electrode. 2. Measurement of the difference of potential between the electrodes, \u0394E', in the sample solution, carried out with the same cell II without changing the IL in the outer compartment of the reference electrode. 3. The calculation of pHH2O abs\nvalues is performed according to Eq.\u00a01:\nThis procedure follows the multipoint calibration recommended by IUPAC [1]. To validate the measurement method based on cell design II, the samples were also measured with cell I using the independent reference method described in Heering et\u00a0al. [10]. Using this method, pHH2O\nabs values for phosphate\nbuffer were measured by two institutes, whereas pHH2O abs values for formate buffer were obtained by three institutes.\npH glass electrode|sample or standard pH buffer solution|[N 2225 ][NTf 2 ]|KClaq|AgCl|Ag II\n(1)pH H 2 O\nabs =\n(\u0394E\ufffd \u2212 intercept)\nslope\nThe feasibility of replacing the KCl salt bridge of a doublejunction commercial combined pH electrode with ionic liquid was assessed. EtOH-trode electrodes from Metrohm were used. The preliminary tests made after a few weeks of stabilising IL inside the electrode showed that these electrodes are unsuitable for the comparison. The electrodes exhibit a drift (both intercept and slope) with a magnitude 10 times larger than before their modification by introducing IL. Their behaviour is highly affected by an unstable flow from the aqueous inner solution to outer IL. The results do not match the reference pHH2O\nabs values (cell I), and the shift depends on the solvent.\nThe reason is probably the ground-joint diaphragm, which does not allow for sufficient IL leakage. Therefore, combined glass electrodes have been used as glass electrode half-cells, thus measuring only the glass electrode signal against an external double-junction Ag/AgCl reference electrode."

It was decided among the\nFig. 1 Left: measurement setup for cell I. Right: measurement setup for cell II\n1 3\nparticipants that all the institutes would consistently take into account a standard uncertainty related to the residual liquid junction potential (RLJP) of 7\u00a0mV. This value originates from investigations made by ALU-FR [16] on liquid junctions in aqueous and non-aqueous solutions. It does not consider ionic strength effects nor correlations between calibration and measurement. This uncertainty estimate of (RLJP) to the overall uncertainty is conservative, as the value was obtained as an average from experiments with a number of solvents, most of them more different from water than ethanol. Surely, the effect of RLJP is different for each sample solution, hence demanding further research. As the liquid junction potential dominates the pHH2O\nabs\nmeasurement uncertainty, all the reported measurement uncertainties are of comparable magnitude.\nConsensus values of\u00a0participant results of\u00a0the\u00a0interlaboratory comparison and\u00a0their uncertainties\nThe phosphate and formate buffers have been prepared individually at each institute, as they can be considered independent. For phosphate buffer, the pHH2O\nabs values reported by Lab\u00a01 and Lab\n10 were left out: Lab 1 used cell I instead of cell II and Lab 10 reported problems during solution preparation.\nLab 4 has two results for both buffers, each measured with a different electrode. Only one value, that Lab 4 reported as their interlaboratory comparison result, is used for consensus value. The other value is shown in Fig.\u00a02 as a comparison.\nThe interlaboratory comparison consensual values involve the consensus of the participating laboratories from the reported results through the median as a more robust estimation than the mean, being less sensitive to outliers.\nThe consensual pHH2O abs values (the median) together with their associated standard uncertainties are 8.74 \u00b1 0.09 (k = 1) for phosphate buffer in 50 wt% aqueous ethanol and 8.77 \u00b1 0.07 (k = 1) for formate buffer in > 99.5% ethanol. The calculations are described in the Supplementary material.\nThe standard uncertainties for the pHH2O abs assigned to the two samples analysed with cell II are very similar. These\nuncertainties include all the factors that may vary from one laboratory to another that cannot be evaluated individually. The very close obtained values suggest that the potentiometric alternative method is well implemented by the participants to the interlaboratory comparison and can be attributed to the fact that the applied procedure is clear and complete enough.\nComparison between the consensual pHH2O abs values with the reference pHH2O\nabs values from Table\u00a01 allows detection\nof a possible bias and hence enables to estimate the trueness of the alternative method. A perfect agreement with reference pHH2O\nabs values obtained with the cell I has been\nfound for phosphate buffer despite the fact the preparation of this buffer is more complex as four compounds had to be weighed and the desired solvent ratio exactly be matched. The agreement is poorer for the formate buffer, although suitable as the results remain consistent within the standard uncertainty. The differences in consistency between the samples might be explained by the nature of the solvent. Indeed, pure ethanol buffer solutions seem to be more sensitive to handling. More research is needed to give a full explanation.\nNo evidence could be found for the dependency of pHH2O abs measurement results on the age of the sample solutions. Sample ages from 0 to 20\u00a0days were investigated. Also, no evidence could be found for the pHH2O\nabs measurement result\nto depend on the electrode used for the measurements irrespective of the measurement method (cell design I vs. II).\nMoreover, results obtained from measurements at 23\u00a0\u00b0C were found to agree with the other results obtained at 25\u00a0\u00b0C,\n1 3\nindicating the pHH2O abs not being significantly temperaturedependent for the matrices investigated in this study. Phosphate buffer with the same composition was analysed (not published results) within the past EURAMET EMRP project \u201cMetrology for Biofuels\u201d using a primary pH system, and the calculated temperature coefficient was about \u2212 0.006 pH/\u00b0C. pHH2O\nabs method\nis, thus, not sensitive enough to highlight such small differences.\nConclusions\npH H 2 O\nabs Values of two ethanol samples with different ethanol content were measured in an interlaboratory comparison by 10 participants. The consensual values are 8.74 \u00b1 0.09 (k = 1) for phosphate buffer in 50% ethanol (median of 8 values) and 8.77 \u00b1 0.07 (k = 1) for formate buffer in ethanol (median of 10 values). Results obtained from the measurement method based on cell design II were consistent for both samples.\nThe interlaboratory comparison involves laboratories that can represent end-users using the pHH2O\nabs measurement according to\ncell design II, which end-users can easily adopt. The exercise showed that buffered solutions, with assigned pHH2O\nabs values (and\nassociated uncertainty), could be reproducibly prepared for use in routine measurement laboratory. Hence, a simple potentiometric method can be considered suitable for measuring pHH2O\nabs in several\nindustrial applications [2\u20134]. Additional results obtained from the reference method (cell design I) were found to be consistent with results from the method based on cell design II, independently of the used electrode, thus supporting the robustness of the pHH2O\nabs\nsimple and accessible measurement procedure using cell design II.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s00216- 023- 05043-5.\nFunding Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.
