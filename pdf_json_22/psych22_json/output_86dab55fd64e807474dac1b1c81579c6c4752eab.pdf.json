In a survey, 1,783 students from Medical University of Gdan\u0301sk and University of Gdan\u0301sk participated in our study, of whom 1,223 were included in the final statistical analysis. All of them were evaluated using valid and reliable questionnaires\u2013TIPI-PL, PSS-10, and a one-item scale of quality of life. Stress turned out to have a negative effect on quality of life, regardless of the type of field of study. Moreover, students from different fields varied in terms of personality factors: conscientiousness, agreeableness, openness to experience, and emotional stability. In conclusion, many students regardless of their field suffer from high stress and report low quality of life, which potentially further affects their academic performance and social life.\nKeywords: mental health, academic performance, students, quality of life, personality\nINTRODUCTION\nMedical studies, due to an enormous amount of required knowledge, are widely considered to be difficult. Additionally, high social status and responsibility associated with being a medical doctor can make the environment of a medical university a great source of stress. What is more, medical universities are often described by students as full of unhealthy competition (Yusoff, 2014) especially during the first half of medical studies (Midtgaard et al., 2008). Scientists report an immense influence of continuous and excessive stress on physical and mental health (Ribeiro et al., 2018) as well as psychological condition\u2013it may increase the risk of depression, anxiety, and burnout (Pacheco et al., 2017; Pawlaczyk et al., 2020). As a consequence, medical students may be more likely to develop these conditions than the general population (Pacheco et al., 2017). What is more, distress can impact not only their mental health and quality of life but its consequences\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 1 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 815369\ncan also affect their professional functioning, such as academic performance (Dyrbye et al., 2005) and medical career, accounting for poorer patient care and risk of more frequent medical mistakes (Fahrenkopf et al., 2008; De Vibe et al., 2013). Additionally, a similar issue is observed in student nurses population (Chernomas and Shapiro, 2013; Kleiveland et al., 2015). Numerous studies indicate that precisely clinical experience is the most anxiety-inducing part of their education program (Jimenez et al., 2010; Chernomas and Shapiro, 2013) and faced with those difficulties student nurses feel pressured and exhausted (Evans and Kelly, 2004).\nHowever, the presented problem occurs also in other, nonmedical professions (who also prepare to work in jobs related to health and psychological condition) and can be observed earlier in the students\u2019 population too. Despite their work and studies not being viewed as stressful by society, psychology (Myers et al., 2012; De Vibe et al., 2013), and pedagogy (Rieg et al., 2007; Rowicka, 2020) students and professionals are also exposed to continuous and excessive stress. Studies on psychologists show that professionals who do not manage job-related stress well are at risk of burnout and impairment (Norcross and VandenBos, 2018). Possibly it would also affect their patients as a psychologists\u2019 health influences their ability to provide professional help (American Psychological Association, 2017).\nAlthough the issue of self-perceived stress, quality of life (QoL), and personality traits in students of medicine and psychology is addressed by researchers, there is also a need to investigate these aspects among students of related fields, such as nursing and pedagogy. Despite the fact that the problems described in earlier paragraphs were investigated in some studies focused on medical students (Henning et al., 2012; Pagnin and De Queiroz, 2015), there is a lack of consensus in the research community about the final shape of relationship between QoL and stress in medicine students, but also in students of social sciences. What is more, there are few studies discussing and comparing the functioning of Polish medical and social field students in the presented issues.\nThe study carried out by Humburg (2017) suggests that personality traits are as important as cognitive skills when it comes to choosing a university field. For example, conscientiousness is positively related to probability of studying medical sciences (Humburg, 2017). The 6-year longitudinal study conducted by Tyssen et al. (2007) among Norwegian medical students, showed that the combination of both high neuroticism and high conscientiousness can predict medical school stress. Ebstrup et al. (2011) measured the relationship between perceived stress and the NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) and demonstrated that stress significantly positively correlates with neuroticism and shows a moderate significant negative association with extraversion. Knowing that students of medicine, nursery, and psychology report a higher level of perceived stress, it could be assumed that a many of them will be characterized by a higher level of neuroticism compared to students of pedagogy.\nTherefore, the aim of this study was to examine the relationship between the level of stress and QoL in a group of students from varying fields (H1). Moreover, we wanted to\nexplore differences in terms of personality traits among students of difference fields of study (H2). Lastly, we hypothesize medical students in comparison to non\u2013medical students will declare higher stress levels (H3)."

For almost 60 years the Cantril Scale (CS) has been cited as being an effective tool for measuring general well-being, mental health, and happiness. Moreover, the administration of the Cantril Ladder is simple and does not require a major investment of time for either respondent or interviewer (Levin and Currie, 2014; Mazur et al., 2018)."

            "text": "The aim of our study was to examine the relationship between the level of stress and QoL in a group of students from varying fields, explore personality traits as a potentially important factor in choosing university fields, and verify whether medical students in comparison to non\u2013medical students will declare higher stress levels.\nThe expected relationship between higher stress levels and lower QoL was confirmed (H1 substantiated). The obtained results also highlighted personality differences between students from the four groups (H2 substantiated) with medical students being the most agreeable differing significantly from nursing and pedagogy students, and more emotionally stable than psychology and pedagogy students. Psychology students, on the other hand, were less extraverted than nursing and pedagogy students, less conscientious than all other students, and more open to experience than medical students.\nNumerous researches reported the negative relationship between stress and QoL in university students (Ribeiro et al., 2018). \u201cQoL was defined, therefore, as individuals\u2019 perception of their position in life in the context of the culture and value\nsystems in which they live, and in relation to their goals, expectations, standards, and concerns\u201d (WHOQoL Group, 1995). There is also a varying outcome when comparing medical students to the general population. Some results present that undergraduate students of medicine report lower QoL level (Pagnin and De Queiroz, 2015), and other show there is no difference in QoL of all university students\u2013however, its level is lower in students group than in a reference group (Henning et al., 2012). Regarding stress levels, we did not discover medical field students to declare higher subjective distress compared to social field students (H3 unsubstantiated).\nApart from the fact that the perceived level of stress is influenced by environmental factors, including potentially the type of study (but our study did not confirm this relationship), personality can also play a role when it comes to choosing a field of study (Pringle et al., 2010). The study carried out by Humburg suggests that personality traits are as important as cognitive skills when it comes to choosing a university field. For example, conscientiousness is positively related to the probability of studying medical sciences (Humburg, 2017). On the contrary Usslepp et al. (2020) assumed that The Big Five traits showed no or only small significant associations with educational track choices and indicated the need of understanding of the importance of various aspects of personality in affecting and structuring the lives of young adults. In our study, we discovered that there were some dependencies between personality factors and type of university fields, but it seems necessary to carry out further studies for more certain conclusions.\nThe presented research has a few apparent strengths, but we are also aware of its limitations. A noticeable advantage is the design of the study including four different courses from two larger fields (medical and social) together with a large sample formed by students from all years in a course. On the other hand, we used convenience sampling, reaching out to students attending a selected class, which accounted for a slight reduction of sample size and may have had an effect on the overall obtained results. Overrepresentation of women in three out of four examined fields (nursing, pedagogy, and psychology) could have affected the obtained results regarding personality traits (Costa et al., 2001; Schmitt et al., 2008) but at the same time it reflects the true structure of the students populations\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 4 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 815369\nin aforementioned fields. Utilizing a correlational analysis restrained us from formulating any cause-and-effect conclusions.\nBased on official statistics of Medical University of Gdan\u0301sk, in 2019 the general population of medical students was 1864 people, and of nursing students\u2013414 people (Sobczak et al., 2021). Therefore, our sample accounts for 22.1% of all medical students and 60.1% nursing students form this university. In the same year, the population of psychology students at University of Gdan\u0301sk was 643, with our sample exploring 50.6% of students. For pedagogy the numbers are 889 and 26.3% (Sobczak et al., 2021). Taking into account both the sample size and its diversity in terms of people from various fields of study\u2013both medical and non-medical\u2013it seems that the study has a high external validity and its results can be generalized to other populations. Additional advantage is the use of standardized and reliable tools, which makes it possible to replicate the study in other countries.\nFurthermore, we would like to put forward some practical implications. Firstly, the study highlights the grave importance of mental health education of students from demanding courses who often experience distress and should be taught effective coping strategies. Secondly, the popularization of mindfulness among young adults could also be beneficial for their subjective QoL (De Vibe et al., 2013). Moreover, it is worth encouraging students to look for various methods of coping with stress, which may include: listening to music, praying, yoga meditation, pursuing their hobbies, or practicing sports (Yikealo et al., 2018). Once they find the best way to minimize their stress level, they should execute it regularly. Providing better financial security, more precise goals, expectations, educational, and research requirements can also help students reduce stress and prevent future mental illness. Additionally, more effective time-out of tasks, credits, and exams preventing accumulation at the end of the year could be beneficial (Bacchi and Licinio, 2017). It also seems crucial to provide medical and social sciences students with universal and free psychological assistance, preferably by establishing university psychological centers or cooperating with external units providing such services.\nIn conclusion, many students are subjected to high levels of stress lowering their QoL and possibly affecting their academic performance and overall studying experience. Both medical and social field students experience this heightened distress, despite distinct public views of the mentioned fields. Students selecting different courses as their future career paths significantly differ from each other in terms of personality traits. In terms of\nextraversion and conscientiousness, psychology students scored lower and significantly deviated from the results of other studied groups. On the other hand, this group of students showed the highest openness to experience. Medical students presented the highest scores in terms of agreeability, which ranged significantly from nursing and pedagogy students\u2019 results. Furthermore, when compared to medical students, both psychology and pedagogy students reported lower emotional stability. The causes for these dependencies require clarification and deeper analysis in future research. Literature on the subject, used for creating the base for the hypotheses explored in the study, and data derived from it, suggests that results of this study could be replicated in other countries and foreign populations of medical and social field students. This proves that the results of our research can be useful for preparing personalized treatment programs for students of various fields, and in caring for mental well-being during their academic years. The study highlights key traits of students from particular faculties, essential for keeping the quality of work and learning sufficiently high. Therefore, future research should focus on testing various help and treatment programs to emerge the most optimal coping strategies for students with different personality traits."
