 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate other types of fly ash or waste materials that could be incorporated into amine-infused hydrogels to enhance CO2 adsorption capacity and kinetics. The paper only looked at one type of fly ash, but there may be other waste materials that could provide benefits.

2. Optimize the hydrogel composition and synthesis methods to maximize porosity, amine loading, and CO2 diffusion rates. The paper used acrylic acid and acrylamide, but other monomers or synthesis techniques could improve the hydrogel properties. 

3. Test the hydrogels under actual flue gas conditions, including the presence of moisture and other contaminants. The paper used pure CO2, so evaluating performance under real-world conditions is needed.

4. Evaluate the long-term stability and reuse potential of the amine-infused hydrogels through multiple adsorption-desorption cycles. The paper only looked at single use, so cycling studies are needed.

5. Explore immobilization of other amine types or mixtures of amines in the hydrogels to optimize CO2 capture capacity and kinetics. The paper only used monoethanolamine, but other amines may perform better.
