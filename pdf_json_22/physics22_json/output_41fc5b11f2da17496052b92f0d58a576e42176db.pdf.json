    "abstractText": "The investigation of the hot filament chemical vapor deposition nanodiamonds with simultaneously embedded luminescent GeV\u2212 and SiV\u2212 color centers from solid sources showed that both the absolute and relative intensities of their zero-phonon lines (at 602 and 738 nm) depend on nanodiamond growth conditions (a methane concentration in the CH4/H2 gas mixture, growth temperature, and time). It is shown that a controlled choice of parameters of hot filament chemical vapor deposition synthesis makes it possible to select the optimal synthesis conditions for tailoring bicolor fluorescence nanodiamond labels for imaging biological systems.",

            "text": "Diamond nanoparticles (nanodiamonds, ND) with embedded fluorescent color centers, being biocompatible non-toxic materials that exhibit stable emission with high brightness without photobleaching, are considered as promising fluorescence labels for imaging biological systems [1,2]. Importantly, methods to chemically modify the surface of NDs that allow entering cells, targeting labeling, sensing, and drug delivery, are described [3]. Except for NDs with well-studied NV\u2212 color centers, other fluorescent color centers based on group IV elements, such as the negatively charged silicon vacancy (SiV\u2212) and germanium vacancy (GeV\u2212), are attracting much attention [4\u20137]. They advantageously demonstrate emission mostly in their narrow zero-phonon line (ZPL) with a much better spectral stability than the NV\u2212 centers, even under ambient conditions and a much larger Debye\u2013Waller factor (up to ~0.7 for SiV\u2212 and ~0.6 for GeV\u2212 [8\u201310]) due to weak electron\u2013phonon coupling [11]. With ZPL at 738 and 602 nm for SiV\u2212 and GeV\u2212, respectively, they may be considered as good candidates for multicolor biolabeling [2]. The SiV\u2212 and GeV\u2212 centers have a very similar electronic level structure with D3d symmetry [12]. Both negatively charged silicon-vacancy (SiV\u2212) and germanium-vacancy (GeV\u2212) centers can be formed with several techniques: ion implantation [13,14], shock wave synthesis, and doping during HPHT [15,16] and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth [17\u201320]. Among these methods, the CVD approaches look most attractive, since the ion implantation often results in lattice damage, causing strains and the degradation of optical properties. For the detonation and HTHP syntheses, it is hard to provide the reliable production of a high-purity material with a controlled amount of color centers and good optical properties, and they cannot provide mass production of fluorescent ND. On the other hand, according to [20], the SiV\u2212 or GeV\u2212 centers possessing bright emissions can be successfully formed in NDs by CVD synthesis using small pieces of crystalline Si or Ge\nMaterials 2022, 15, 3589. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma15103589 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2022, 15, 3589 2 of 8\nplaced on the holder near the NDs as a source of ions. This approach opens a way to create a multicolor solid-state source of light for bioimaging by using diamond nanoparticles with simultaneously or subsequently embedded several fluorescent color centers, e.g., the SiV\u2212 and GeV\u2212 centers emitting at 738 and 602 nm. The hot filament chemical vapor deposition (HFCVD) method was used in [19], allowing the synthesis of NDs with simultaneously introduced GeV\u2212 and SiV\u2212 color centers. The known data on the measurement of the luminescence excitation spectra of SiV\u2212 and GeV\u2212 centers [7] show that the luminescence of both centers can be effectively excited by radiation of one wavelength, for example, 488 nm yielding a two-color emitter of bright and spectrally narrow lines. Using this approach, however, the problem of controlling the level of doping of the ND crystal with color centers of different types arises, which determines the spectral and kinetic parameters of the fluorescence of the centers and the possible effects of the interaction of the centers with each other. As was shown in [19\u201322], the luminescence intensity of color centers in CVD diamonds depends strongly on the growth conditions. Therefore, it becomes urgent to study the influence of the growth conditions of NDs doped with different centers and post-synthesis treatment of the ND on optical parameters of luminescence of the embedded color centers. In this work, we report the HFCVD nanodiamonds with simultaneously embedded luminescent GeV\u2212 and SiV\u2212 color centers from solid sources and show that both the absolute and relative intensities of their ZPLs (at 602 and 738 nm) depend on ND growth conditions (a methane concentration in the CH4/H2 gas mixture, growth time, and substrate temperature)."

Materials and Methods\n2.1. The Fabrication of Luminescent Nanodiamonds\nThe formation of nanodiamonds doped with luminescent GeV\u2212 and SiV\u2212 centers was\ncarried out in two stages. First, the method of aerosol deposition of nanodiamonds of det-\nonation synthesis with a size of ~5 nm on a silicon substrate, was used to form individual\nisolated centers of nucleation of diamond particles on the surface for subsequent CVD\nsynthesis with a concentration of 107 cm\u22122 [23]. Next, the samples of the substrate with\ndeposited nucleation centers, which were previously subjected to atomic hydrogen etch-\ning to activate the surface, were used to grow diamond particles by HFCV from hydro-\ngen\u2013methane mixture. This method is based on the decomposition of methane and hy-\ndrogen near the hot helix into hydrocarbon radicals and atomic hydrogen, which diffuse\nto the heated substrate, leading to the growth of diamond particles on pre-deposited dia-\nmond nucleation centers [19] (see Figure 1).\nMaterials 2022, 15, 3589 3 of 8\nThe formation of color centers during the growth of diamond particles was carried out by introducing a dopant into the gas phase. A schematic diagram of doping of diamond particles during HFCVD growth is shown in Figure 1. The substitutional donors were volatile GeHx and SiHx radicals obtained with atomic hydrogen etching bulk crystalline germanium and silicon wafers that were located nearby on the substrate holder during CVD growth and used as a solid-state source of Ge and Si atoms. The temperatures of the solidstate sources were higher than the silicon substrate temperature by ~130 \u25e6C. The volatile GeHx and SiHx radicals move to the substrate surface by means of the diffusion process. The Ge and Si atoms, integrating into the diamond lattice from the gas phase, promoted the formation of ensembles of GeV\u2212 and SiV\u2212 centers in ND. The investigated samples of luminescent NDs were obtained under the following parameters of the HFCVD process: temperature of the tungsten filament, 2000\u20132200 \u25e6C; substrate temperature, T = 600\u2013750 \u25e6C; operating pressure in the reactor\u201450 Torr; hydrogen flow\u2014500 sccm; a methane concentration in the CH4/H2 gas mixture\u2014C(CH4) = 1\u20138%; the growth time of diamond particles is t = 2\u20134 h. The distance between the tungsten spiral and the substrate holder is 10\u201312 mm. The size of the substrate is 2 mm \u00d7 2 mm. Before starting the HFCVD growth process, the reactor is pumped down to a pressure of 10\u22122 Torr."

The images were obtained with the Zeiss Scanning Electron Microscope, \u201cMerlin\u201d, at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV at a probe current of 150 pA. To improve the image quality and topological contrast, the samples were fixed with carbon tape to create a conductive bridge between the silicon substrate and the sample holder, and the signals from the InLens and Everhart-Thornley SE2 detectors were recorded simultaneously. The luminescence spectra of the nanodiamonds were measured using a Renishaw \u201cInVia\u201d Raman spectrometer equipped with a confocal microscope, liquid-nitrogen-cooled CCD, and 1800 lines/mm grating. The spectral resolution of the spectrometer was ~2 cm\u22121. The excitation laser radiation of 488 nm was focused by a 100\u00d7 lens (NA = 0.9) into a spot with a diameter of ~2 \u00b5m on the single selected ND crystal. To correctly compare the luminescence intensities of GeV\u2212 and SiV\u2212 centers that possess different emission wavelengths, they were normalized on the spectral sensitivity of the spectrometer determined preliminary by a standard \u201cblack body\u201d emission. Since the used spectrometer allows both the luminescence and Raman spectra to be obtained simultaneously from the same individual ND, for a comparison of the luminescence intensities obtained from nanocrystals of different sizes, the luminescence intensities were also normalized to the intensity of the diamond Raman line of ~1332 cm\u22121 (521.9 nm), which is proportional to the illuminated nanocrystal volume. All measurements were carried out at least 5 times to prove the reproducibility of the data obtained."

ND particles were grown for 2h on a crystalline silicon substrate heated up to 720 \u25e6C. The synthesis time and substrate temperature here are in the range corresponding, as will be seen below, to the conditions for simultaneous observation of the ZPLs of both GeV\u2212 and SiV\u2212 centers. The luminescence spectra clearly demonstrate that not only absolute but also relative intensities of ZPLs of the GeV\u2212 and SiV\u2212 centers at 602 nm and 738.2 nm depend on the methane concentration in the mixture, as shown in the inset of Figure 2.

As the methane concentration increases, the SiV\u2212 luminescence intensity reaches a maximum at a methane concentration of 2% and then begins to decrease by more than an order of magnitude at a methane concentration of 6%. On the other hand, an increase in methane concentration leads to a monotonic increase in the intensity of ZPL of GeV\u2212 centers. It can also be seen that an increase in the methane concentration leads to an increase in the intensity of the broadband background in the region of 550\u2013700 nm, which, according to [19,20], is associated with an increase in the volume of surface regions containing structural defects and sp2-hybridized carbon. The Raman spectra presented in Figure 2c demonstrate a characteristic diamond band at 1332 cm\u22121, the width of which increases with increasing methane concentration in the mixture, indicating an increase in the defectiveness of the crystal structure and the presence of the sp2 carbon phase in the synthesized ND.

The optimal concentration of methane in the range from 4% to 5% was determined, which corresponds to the growth of bicolor nanodiamonds\nMaterials 2022, 15, 3589 7 of 8\nwith comparable ZPL intensities of the GeV\u2212 and SiV\u2212 centers. The study of the substrate temperature dependences of photoluminescence showed that the ZPL intensity of the SiV\u2212 center increases with temperature and the ZPL intensity of the GeV\u2212 center is maximal at the temperature of ~700 \u25e6C. It was found that an increase in NDs size leads to an approximately two-fold increase in the GeV\u2212 ZPL intensity with an analogous reduction of the SiV\u2212 ZPL. The analysis of the experimental results allowed us to conclude that GeV\u2212 centers are localized in the more defective regions of diamond nanocrystals, while SiV\u2212 centers are mainly localized in the nanocrystal region with the more ordered crystal structure. An increase in methane concentration, substrate temperature, and growth time results in increasing the volume of ND regions containing structural defects and, consequently, the growth of ZPL intensity in GeV\u2212 centers, and a reduction of ZPL in SiV\u2212 centers. The dependences obtained make it possible to select the parameters for the synthesis of nanodiamonds (substrate temperature of ~630\u2013700 \u25e6C, methane concentration of ~4\u20135%, the growth time of 2\u20134 h) to achieve the optimal luminescent responses of both GeV\u2212 and SiV\u2212 color centers embedded in the nanodiamonds. Thus, the possibility of creating stable twocolor narrow-band emitters by simultaneous doping of CVD nanodiamonds with silicon and germanium atoms, with the possibility of varying and redistributing the intensities of luminescent responses by changing the synthesis parameters, has been demonstrated.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, A.V.B. and V.G.G.; methodology, N.A.F., I.E.K., M.A.B. and S.A.G.; investigation, K.V.B., N.A.F., I.E.K. and M.A.B.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, A.V.B.; writing\u2014review and editing, A.V.B., K.V.B., V.G.G. and S.A.G.; supervision, A.V.B.; project administration, A.V.B.; funding acquisition, A.V.B.
