    "abstractText": "The composition of bioactive polyphenols from grape canes, an important viticultural byproduct, was shown to be varietal-dependent; however, the influence of soil-related terroir factors remains unexplored. Using spatial metabolomics and correlation-based networks, we investigated how continuous changes in soil features and topography may impact the polyphenol composition in grape canes. Soil properties, topography, and grape cane extracts were analyzed at georeferenced points over 3 consecutive years, followed by UPLC-DAD-MS-based metabolomic analysis targeting 42 metabolites. Principal component analyses on intra-vintage metabolomic data presented a good reproducibility in relation to geographic coordinates. A correlation-driven approach was used to explore the combined influence of soil and topographic variables on metabolomic responses. As a result, a metabolic cluster including flavonoids was correlated with elevation and curvature. Spatial metabolomics driven by correlation-based networks represents a powerful approach to spatialize field-omics data and may serve as new field-phenotyping tool in precision agriculture.",

            "text": "Grape polyphenols represent a broad range of bioactive specialized metabolites whose variation depends on genotype and environmental conditions. They are highly diverse and distributed as stilbenoids, flavonoids, and phenolic acids. Stilbenoids are important grape phytoalexins that prevent attacks by fungi, bacteria, nematodes, and herbivores [1]. Stilbenoids are largely accumulated in grape canes, an abundant viticultural byproduct [2]. E-resveratrol and its oligomeric derivatives are well-studied biomolecules thanks to their health benefits, including the prevention of several diseases of particular concern such as cancers, obesity, atherosclerosis, and Alzheimer\u2019s disease [3]. Grape polyphenols are also involved in cell longevity and health maintenance [4] and act as a cardiovascular protectant in early atherosclerosis [5]. Biocontrol activity of grape cane extracts towards grape downy mildew was also reported [2]. Grape polyphenol metabolism is highly plastic and relies on interactions between genotypic and environmental factors. Polyphenol-based discrimination within genotypes\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4555. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28114555 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nof the same berry color has been reported for berries [6] and wines [7], as well as in grape byproducts [2]. Additionally, environmental conditions may also alter polyphenol composition. Indeed, plant water status and sunlight exposure are important regulators of flavonoids in berries [8], and disease pressure observed during the growing season was shown to impact the polyphenol composition in grape cane harvest during winter [9]. The scientific interpretation of the terroir concept reflects the complex interaction between grapevine, topography (slope, curvature, elevation), climate (temperature, rainfall, and solar radiation), soil properties (pedology, geology, and microbiome), as well as viticultural and wine-making practices [10]. Whereas it was possible to show regional variations in the chemical composition of grape and wine, understanding the determinant factors that drive grape quality remains highly challenging because terroir expression is the result of a multi-parametric system that must be considered at the within-vineyard scale. Several \u201comics\u201d approaches were successively deployed to investigate the complexity of terroir signature in distant vineyards [11]. Indeed, metabolomics was used to reveal the signature of terroir and vintage in wine and grape quality [12,13]. In addition, transcriptomics revealed the metabolic plasticity of berries from three macro-areas in the region of Verona in Italy [14]. Finally, metagenomics highlighted the effect of regional microbial diversity on wine quality [15], and variability in epigenetics was also observed in different geographic locations [16]. Despite these recent advances, no \u201comics\u201d study tackles the terroir influence in continuous space with readily assessable environmental changes. The measurements of georeferenced positions enable spatial monitoring of soil properties and grapevine response [17]; therefore, the spatialization of metabolomics datasets appears to be a meaningful strategy to investigate terroir influence. Additionally, correlation-based networks are useful to explore and interpret complex datasets through the identification of key network nodes [18]. They have been used to reveal grape polyphenols with similar patterns of accumulations under genotypic variations and following pathogen infection [2]. The aim of this study was to assess soil- and topography-based terroir influence in a vineyard parcel covering different soil types with a contrasted topography and planted with a unique clone of Cabernet Franc located in the Loire Valley (France). Soil properties and topography were analyzed at georeferenced points using spatial coverage sampling and grape canes were harvested at the same positions over 3 consecutive years prior to UPLC-DAD-MS-based metabolomics analysis. Principal component analyses revealed vintage and intra-vintage effects. Correlation-based networks were used to assess the global structure of the metabolomic datasets in relation to topography and soil properties over the 3 years. Finally, the conserved metabolomics clusters were mapped and compared to soil property maps."

Variables in loading plot (B) were colored according to polyphenols\u2019 class and numbered according to compound name (C).\nCentering and clustering of QC samples confirmed the robustness of UPLC-DADMS-based measurements and low analytical variability. Variation coefficients for each compound were less than 15% and 20% for metabolites with high and low concentrations, respectively, corresponding to standard precision of analytical methods [19]. The discrimination of the 3 years on PC1 showed a major vintage effect on total polyphenols (value = 17,352; p < 0.001; Table S2). Samples from 2015 and 2016 were projected on PC1 negative (low relative concentrations), while samples from the 2017 vintage were projected on PC1 positive with high relative concentrations for flavonoids and stilbenoid DP2, as shown by the corresponding loading plot (Figure 2B). PCA observations were completed by robust two-way ANOVA for trimmed means, with interaction effects showing significant vintage (p < 0.05) and spatial effects (p < 0.001), as well as their interactions (p < 0.001), for all compounds (Table S2).

We used correlation networks to select co-varying metabolites for future spatialization studies. In this way, pair-wise Pearson correlations between 42 polyphenols, geographic coordinates, as well as topographic and soil parameters were calculated for each vintage dataset. Among the 1711 tested correlations, the metabolite network from vintage 2015 showed 165 significant positive correlations (threshold: r > 0.5; p < 0.05), the network from vintage 2016 showed 171 significant positive correlations (threshold: r > 0.5; p < 0.05), while the network from vintage 2017 encompassed 140 significant positive correlations (threshold: r > 0.5; p < 0.05). Figure 4A\u2013C shows the corresponding networks with metabolite, topography, and soil parameters represented as nodes and significant correlations by edges. The shorter the node distance, the higher the correlation. Polyphenols were intercorrelated according to different subclasses, forming different metabolite clusters. Additionally, soil parameters formed two clusters, with the first composed of clay, fine silt, CEC, organic matter, organic carbon, coarse silt, and pH, and the second composed of total nitrogen, Mg, and P2O5. Whereas network structures varied over the 3 consecutive years in response to vintage effect, four metabolic clusters were observed regardless of the year. The first cluster was mainly composed of flavonoids, the second by stilbenoid DP2 and DP3, and the third by stilbenoid DP3 and DP4. To exclude correlations induced by vintage-specific environmental factors, a new network based only on conserved correlations was built, exhibiting 72 significant positive correlations (threshold: r > 0.5; p < 0.05) and four main metabolite clusters (Figure 4D). The first cluster was composed of flavonoids (cluster 1; catechin (5), epicatechin3-O-gallate (9), astilbin (10), quercetin-3-O-glucoside (16), quercetin-3-O-glucuronide (23), procyanidin B1 (24), procyanidin B2 (25), procyanidin B3 (26), procyanidin B4 (27), and procyanidin trimer (34)) and the second of stilbenoid DP3 and DP4 (cluster 2; resveratrol trimer2 (31), dehydrogenated resveratrol tetramer (35), hopeaphenol (36), resveratrol tetramer1 (39), resveratrol tetramer3 (40), and viniferol E (42)). Additionally, two minor clusters were observed including a limited number of metabolites. Cluster 3 was composed of stilbenoid DP2 and DP3 (E-\u03b5-viniferin (13), E-\u03c9-viniferin (14), and resveratrol trimer 1 (30)) and cluster 4 was composed of stilbenoid DP3 (\u03b1-viniferin (29), E-miyabenol C (32), and resveratrol trimer 3 (33)). The repetitive occurrence of these clusters suggested control by environmental factors with lasting effects over vintages and probably in relation to topography and soil properties. The conserved metabolic cluster 1 presented edges with X (longitude), elevation, and curvature, suggesting that flavonoid metabolism was induced toward the east direction, where the slope and elevation are important. In contrast, no conserved correlations were found between the texture and the chemical composition of\nsoils and the metabolic variables.

However, the terroir signature results from the complex interplay of multiple factors including grapevine genotypes (scion and rootstock), climate (temperature, rainfall, solar radiation, and biotic stresses), soil properties (pedology, geology, and microbiome), and topography, as well as viticultural and wine-making practices, and it remained difficult to unravel the potential significance of a single terroir component. The present study was designed in a continuous space of 1.35 ha with a spatial coverage sampling strategy and a focus on topography, soil properties, and grape cane metabolomic composition. Thanks to the E-Terroir Database, it was possible to select a vineyard with contrasted topography and soil properties, planted with a single clone Cabernet Franc grafted on the same rootstock and grown with the same viticultural practices. The present field setup was designed to mitigate at least some variations not studied herein, such as grapevine genetic and viticultural practices. However, in realistic vineyards conditions, it remains difficult to overcome significant vintage factors such as temperature, rainfall, solar radiation, and biotic stresses. A experimental design spanning several years could help to reveal the long-lasting vintage-specific effects."

In the present study, PCA was used as an unbiased dimensionality-reduction method to summarize the variations within the 3-year dataset (Figure 2). The vintage effect (projected along PC1) was the first driver of grapevine metabolic variations, with higher polyphenol contents in 2017 compared with 2016 and 2015. Dry weather was observed in 2015 and 2016 (Figure S6) in contrast to regular rainfalls in 2017, and it is likely that climatic conditions in 2017 were suitable for fungal developments with potential induction on grape phytoalexins. It has been observed that drought conditions significantly reduced stilbene concentrations in wines [20] and, conversely, powdery and downy mildews increased stilbenoid levels in leaves and canes [9]. The spatial effect (projected along PC2) was the second driver of metabolomic variations (Figure 2). This was confirmed by the sample distribution in vintage-specific PCAs (Figure 3), where polyphenol subclasses were projected according to vineyard orientation in a repeatable manner over the 3 years. Additionally, robust two-way ANOVA showed that the spatial effect was lower than the vintage effect for most of the metabolites (Table S2). In different studies on vines or wines using multivariate statistics, the detection of terroir influence with long-lasting signatures emerged behind vintage variations. From berry metabolomes on volatile and non-volatile compounds, it was possible to discriminate different macro-zones in Italy behind a dominant vintage effect [12]. A metabolomics study from geographically close vineyards highlighted a strong vintage effect in wine, skin, and must, but revealed a terroir-related signature only in bottle-aged wine [13]. The predominance of the vintage effect on grape metabolism always makes it difficult to study the underlying environmental impacts. Advanced methods in data curation such as network analysis could be helpful to reveal metabolomic data structuration."

            "text": "Network analysis is a simple way to visualize metabolite correlations and allows complex dataset interpretation without a preliminary assumption of biosynthetic pathways, even in noisy datasets [18]. Metabolites are displayed as nodes connected by \u201clinks\u201d showing molecular interactions in a biological system. Thereby, metabolic fluctuations and interdependencies may result from similar control mechanisms under endogenous or exogenous factors. In grapevine, network analysis has been increasingly used in different\ncontexts, including berry development, genotype difference, and changes in environmental factors [21]. In the present study, network structures over the three vintages showed high connectedness between structure-related metabolites, especially within flavonoids and stilbenoids; however, variations could also be observed over the three vintages. Then, we used a conserved network to represent the structuration of polyphenol metabolism in response to topography and soil composition over the 3 years. Four main conserved metabolite clusters were observed, composed according to polyphenol subclasses. Interestingly, grape canes showed similar metabolite clusters under varying environmental factors (this study) and genetic conditions [2]. The opposite clustering of flavonoids and stilbenoids has been previously observed and may rely on biochemical basis. STS is the key enzyme of stilbenoids biosynthesis and CHS is the first enzyme of flavonoid metabolism; both enzymes belong to the same superfamily of type III polyketide synthases and compete for the same substrates, that is, p-coumaroyl-CoA and 3 units of malonyl CoA. In the present study, depending on topography, either STS- or CHS-derived polyphenols were accumulated. These two competing pathways might result from a complex network of WRKY and MYB transcription factors including both repressors and activators in response to environmental cues, including biotic downy mildew infection, mechanical wounding, or exposure to UV-C radiations [22]. About 100 stilbenoids, with various degrees of polymerization, have been reported for the Vitis genus [23]; however, only little knowledge is available regarding biochemical oligomerization of resveratrol oligomers [24]. In grape leaves exposed to UV-pulse, resveratrol monomers (DP1) accumulated earlier than viniferins (DP2), showing a time-dependent accumulation of resveratrol polymers [25]. The high connectivity of structure-related polyphenols suggests common biosynthesis regulatory mechanisms. Moreover, the clustering according to stilbenoid polymerization degree suggests that specific oxidative polymerization enzymes controlled biosynthetic fluxes within stilbenoid metabolism. However, enzymatic oxidative polymerization of stilbenoids remains poorly understood, although several grapevine class III peroxidases forming \u03b4-viniferin have recently been proposed [26]. Considering E-resveratrol clustering (metabolite 3 in Figure 4), it was striking to observe different positions in correlation-based metabolite networks over the 3 years. Indeed, E-resveratrol variations correlated with flavonoids and stilbenoids DP2 in 2015 and 2016 (Figure 4A,B), but not in 2017 (Figure 4C), depending on vintages with different climatic conditions. This likely indicates that the biosynthesis of the stilbene phytoalexin precursor E-resveratrol is controlled by numerous regulatory mechanisms, as assumed by the identification of 47 STS family genes under the regulation of multiple MYB and WRKY transcription factors that coordinate grape defense in response to multiple environmental factors [27,28]."

Flavonoids (cluster 1) were locally induced in sloping areas and at the top of the vineyard. In contrast, stilbenoid DP4 (cluster 2) showed an opposite pattern of spatialization (Figure 5), with an induction at the bottom of the vineyard. Interestingly, the gradients of both metabolic clusters were oriented west-south-west, together with the slope direction. Although no strict correlation was found between metabolic clusters and soil properties, the contrasted soil composition of the parcel (Figures S3 and S4) suggests that upstream sandy soils, poor in organic matter and nitrogen, could be associated with high amounts of flavonoids, whereas downstream, finer particle soils, corresponding to colluvial deposits rich in organic matter and nitrogen, could be associated with stilbenoid DP4 (Figures S3 and S4). Although no studies investigated the influence of soil features and topography on bioactive polyphenols from grape canes, interesting knowledge emerged from terroir studies based on berry polyphenols. The highest anthocyanin concentrations were found in the vineyards at a higher elevation facing south-west [29]. Ripening of grape berry is\nfavored in soils with a low available water capacity through global polyphenol induction in berry, particularly anthocyanins, proanthocyanins, and flavonoids [30\u201334]. Our results suggest that the topography influenced flavonoids (cluster 1) in an opposite manner to stilbenoid DP4 (cluster 2). Interestingly, the conserved metabolite clusters 3 and 4, composed of stilbenoid DP2 and 3, showed no variation according to topography or soil properties. Their spatial distribution was specific to vintages, suggesting a regulation of resveratrol dimer and trimers by climatic factors such as temperature, rainfall, solar radiation, and biotic stresses."

The complexity of the terroir signature has been successfully addressed using metabolomics in distant or close vineyards; however, multiple environmental factors occurred concurrently [12]. Thanks to the combination of metabolomics and spatialization studies, it was possible to tackle soil- and topography-based terroir influence on grape cane metabolism at the parcel scale. The correlation-network-driven approach was used to select relevant metabolite clusters prior to spatialization studies. A conserved network from three vintages was generated to remove vintage-specific correlations and to select clusters potentially related to variations in soil composition and topography. These prefiltering steps allowed the extraction of biologically relevant information and spatialization studies on denoised metabolomic datasets. The combination of spatial metabolomics with rapid soil-phenotyping tools such as electromagnetic induction (EMI) that permits to differentiate specific characteristic areas in vineyards could assist the exploration of the terroir concept in viticulture [35]. Aboveground, the combination of spatial metabolomics with non-invasive phenotyping methods such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing methods will be effective to develop precision agriculture [36]. Beyond viticulture, where terroir is a significant concept, metabolomics-correlation-based networks combined with geographical information systems may be used as an additional field-phenotyping tool for precision agriculture to improve crop quality [37]."

QC samples were injected 15 times before running samples to equilibrate the system, and then once every eight samples and again 15 times after the run to check for potential\nanalytical drifts. Every pool of grape canes corresponding to a GPS position was extracted and analyzed three times, corresponding to 270 injected samples (3 vintages \u00d7 30 sampling positions \u00d7 3 extractions). All samples were randomly injected and QC samples were analyzed by unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) to evaluate the reproducibility of the method [19,41]."

Variables were mean-centered and unit-variance scaled prior to multivariate analysis. Soil textural parameters were analyzed by PCA with the \u201csoiltexture\u201d package using the USDA triangle. As normality (\u2018shapiro_test\u2019 function) and variance homogeneity (\u2018levene_test\u2019 function) were not achieved for some variables, robust two-way ANOVA for trimmed means (20%) was computed using the \u2018t2way\u2019 function of the \u201cWRS2\u201d package and enabled primary factor assessment (year and spatial effect) as well as their interaction (year\u2013spatial interaction). Pair-wise Pearson correlations were calculated in R using the \u201ccor\u201d and the \u201ccor.test\u201d functions. Significant correlations (R > 0.5; p < 0.05) were visualized as network correlations using the \u201cigraph\u201d (v1.0.1) and \u201cgplots\u201d packages. The \u201cintersection\u201d function was used to generate a correlation-based network conserved over the three vintages. Conserved metabolomic modules were considered for spatialization analyses."

            "text": "Metabolomics-correlation-based networks combined with GIS mapping were used as an unprecedented strategy to spatialize field-omics data and to explore soil- and topography-based terroir influence. Using multivariate statistics, terroir influence with long-lasting signatures emerged behind vintage variations. Correlation networks were successful to select relevant metabolite clusters prior to spatial distribution analyses. Only part of the polyphenol metabolism mirrored variations in topography with flavonoid metabolism induced upslope and resveratrol tetramers over-accumulated downslope. Spatial metabolomics driven by correlation-based networks thus represents a powerful approach for terroir zoning in viticulture and, more broadly, may serve as a new fieldphenotyping tool in precision agriculture.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28114555/s1.
