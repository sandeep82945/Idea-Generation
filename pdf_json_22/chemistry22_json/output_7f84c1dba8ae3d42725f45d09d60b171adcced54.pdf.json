    "abstractText": "Rapid and sensitive detection of cancer biomarkers is crucial for cancer screening, early detection, and improving patient survival rate. The present study proposes an electrochemical gene-sensor capable of detecting tumor related TP53 gene mutation hotspots by self-assembly of sulfhydryl ended hairpin DNA probes tagged with methylene blue (MB) onto a gold electrode. By performing a hybridization reaction with the target DNA sequence, the gene-sensor can rearrange the probe\u2019s structure, resulting in significant electrochemical signal differences by differential pulse voltammetry. When the DNA biosensor is hybridized with 1 \u03bcM target DNA, the peak current response signal can decrease more than 60%, displaying high sensitivity and specificity for the TP53 gene. The biosensor achieved rapid and sensitive detection of the TP53 gene with a detection limit of 10 nmol L\u22121, and showed good specific recognition ability for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and base sequence mismatches in the TP53 gene affecting residue 248 of the P53 protein. Moreover, the biosensor demonstrated good reproducibility, repeatability, operational stability, and anti-interference ability for target DNA molecule in the complex system of 50% fetal bovine serum. The proposed biosensor provides a powerful tool for the sensitive and specific detection of TP53 gene mutation hotspot sequences and could be used in clinical samples for early diagnosis and detection",

            "text": "Despite advancements in medical care, cancer continues to be the most common cause of death. The key to cancer treatment lies in early detection, diagnosis, and treatment [1]. Currently, early detection of cancer is accomplished by the use of blood chip detection [2], gene detection [3], nano detection [4], positron emission tomography (PET) [5], computed tomography (CT) [6], and other approaches [7]. However, these approaches are highly limited in terms of early cancer detection due to their low sensitivity, high cost, and potential for physical or chemical harm [8]. Additionally, while enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based technologies have high sensitivity and are less invasive, they require long detection times and involve high costs for operation [9\u201311]. As a result, creating analytical tools for the early detection of cancer is critical for medical diagnosis. TP53 is a gene that acts as a tumor suppressor. This gene is mutated in more than 50% of all cancers [12,13] such as liver cancer [14], breast cancer [15], esophageal cancer [16], and lung cancer [17]. The majority of TP53 mutations in human tumors occur in the highly conserved region, with the highest mutation rates occurring at R175, R248, R249, R273, and R282 [18]. Due to its altered spatial conformation, TP53 loses its ability to regulate cell\nBiosensors 2022, 12, 658. https://doi.org/10.3390/bios12080658 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/biosensors\nBiosensors 2022, 12, 658 2 of 10\ngrowth, apoptosis, and DNA repair, and ultimately transitions from a tumor suppressor to an oncogene [19]. As a result of the close association between the TP53 gene and cancer, conditions for early detection of cancer are created. Over the last two decades, the importance of precise early illness detection and the development of personalized therapy have grown. In order to further improve the sensitivity and specificity of cancer marker detection, several novel analytical strategies such as electrochemical methods and electrochemiluminescence methods have been developed [20,21]. Thanks to its short detection time, distinctive hybridization specificity, and miniaturization potential, DNA-based electrochemical biosensors have attracted broad scientific and clinical interest recently [22]. Using electrochemical DNA biosensors based on the hybridization of DNA, specific target sequences can be subsequently measured, wherein a complementary capture probe recognizes the target DNA sequence [23]. The mass of the single-stranded DNA probe monolayer represents a major concern for building sensitive electrochemical biosensors, since the accessibility of target molecules is determined by the homogeneity, density, and upright conformation of ssDNA probes on the electrode surface [24,25]. The signal amplifier, the second component, converts minor changes in the interface into a detectable electrochemical signal [26]. Electrochemical DNA sensors have improved their detection performance when the single-stranded capture probe undergoes structural change from coiled to double-stranded DNA [23,27]. Concurrently, electrochemical DNA sensors provide improved selectivity for identifying tumor-related key genetic indicators such as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). The relatively poor selectivity of linear DNA probes for SNP is a typical problem in mutation analysis since the difference in melting temperatures between totally matched and SNP-containing hybrids can be as tiny as 1\u20132 \u25e6C [28]. If the mutation occurs within the loop area, the molecular beacon technique enhances this difference, resulting in greater discrimination between intact and mutant sequences [29]. Therefore, early diagnosis of patients with sensitive and accurate electrochemical gene-sensors may significantly improve patient survival rates [30,31]. Although TP53 gene mutation detection plays an important role in the early diagnosis of cancer, related electrochemical sensors have rarely been reported. In this study, we constructed a simple and reliable gene-sensor based on an electronic DNA hairpin molecular beacon. Using the high-frequency mutation site R248 of the TP53 gene and its association with cancer, a hairpin probe was functionalized by modification of sulfhydryl and methylene blue (MB). The DNA biosensor with high sensitivity for SNP was designed to be able to effectively distinguish between intact, SNP-containing cancer biomarkers and three-base mismatch sequences, which is of great importance in early cancer screening."

Biosensor fabrication and EIS measurements were characterized using 0.1 M KCl containing 5 mM K3Fe(CN)6 and K4Fe(CN)6. As shown in Figure 2, the semicircle at a high frequency in EIS, represents the charge transfer process, and its diameter represents the charge transfer impedance (Rct) value. The low-frequency linear part represents the electron transfer process of mass diffusion control [38,39]. In comparison to the bare Au electrode (curve a), the ssDNA-Au electrode demonstrated a significantly higher electrontransfer resistance Rct (curve b), owing to the negatively charged phosphate backbone of the ssDNA bound on the electrode\u2019s surface. It will repel [Fe(CN)6]3\u2212/4\u2212, which also have negative charges. Electron transfer is limited by increased steric hindrance and charge accumulation on the electrode surface [40], resulting in a considerable increase in Rct.

The obtained detection limit for TP53 is significantly better than that of the field-effect transistor sensor (100 nM) [45], and is comparable to that of the electrochemical biosensor developed by Otero et al.

With an increase in cDNA concentration, the binding efficiency of the double-stranded was improved, and a larger amount of MB was far away from the electrode surface, resulting in a significant decrease in peak current. When the concentration was increased to 1\u03bcM, the percentage of peak current reduction for 21nt-cDNA reached 60%, providing an ideal signal difference for cDNA detection. As can be seen, the DNA sensor showed high specificity and sensitivity for complementary TP53 gene detection.

A highly ordered hairpin DNA monolayer was formed on the surface of the gold electrode by selfassembly method. With the hybridization reaction with the target sequence, the hairpin probe structure was induced to rearrange into linear DNA double chains, and TP53 gene detection at nanomolar concentration was realized. The results demonstrate that the peak current decrease percentage of the sensor has a good linear relationship with the logarithm of the target DNA concentration (R2 = 0.998) with a low detection limit of 10 nmol L\u22121. More importantly, the biosensor showed sensitive specific recognition ability for a single nucleotide polymorphism in the TP53 gene affecting residue 248 of the P53 protein. There are about 15% and 28% difference in the change rates of peak currents for SBM and TBM compared to cDNA. At the same time, the gene-sensor demonstrated good reproducibility and stability and excellent anti-interference ability for the target DNA molecule in the complex system of 50% fetal bovine serum. It is expected to be applied to the detection of clinical samples and provides a promising rapid method for the early diagnosis and early detection of cancer.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporti g information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/bios12080658/s1, Table S1: The used oligonucleotides in this study; Figure S1: CV of a gold electrode after 16 h exposure to ssDNA at concentrations of 10 nM, 100 nM, 1 \u00b5M and 10 \u00b5M in pH 7.4 PBS (A), and electrode surface coverage of ssDNA probes with different concentrations (B); Figure S2: DPV curves of the electrochemical geno-sensor after 30 min hybridization to 1 \u00b5M 21 nt cDNA and 28 nt cDNA, respectively; Figure S3: Detection capabilities of the DNA sensors for target DNA in complex systems of 50% fetal bovine serum.\nBiosensors 2022, 12, 658 9 of 10\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, X.L. and H.D.; methodology, P.S.; validation, P.S., K.N. and R.L.; formal analysis, P.S. and K.N.; investigation, P.S. and K.N.; resources, X.L.; data curation, P.S.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, P.S. and X.L.; writing\u2014review and editing, X.L., H.D. and J.C.; visualization, P.S.; supervision, X.L. and H.D.; project administration, X.L.; funding acquisition, X.L.
