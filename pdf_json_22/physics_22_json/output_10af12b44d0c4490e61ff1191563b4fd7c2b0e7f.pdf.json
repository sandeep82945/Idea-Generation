            "text": "Let f(x) represent a well behaved function of a single variable x (real or complex) and primes over it denote appropriate derivatives, then S(f(x)) written as\nS(f(x)) = f \u2032\u2032\u2032(x)\nf \u2032(x) \u2212\n3 2 ( f \u2032\u2032(x) f \u2032(x) )2 (1)\nis called the Schwarzian derivative of f(x) or Schwarzian in short [1, 2]. The expression in (1) appears in a wide variety of mathematical and physical context ranging from classical complex analysis to conformal field theory [3]. In the theory of complex variables the linear fractional or Mo\u0308bius transformation given by\nf(x) = ax+ b\ncx+ d (2)\nposses a number of remarkable properties. In particular, the transformation (2) with real coefficients forms a group of symmetries in real projective space [4, 5]. The Schwarzian derivative of f(x) in (2) is zero. Thus for any arbitrary function, S(f(x)) measures how much f differs from being a Mo\u0308bius transformation. It is important to note that the Schwarzian is not a function but represents the difference between a function and a more complicated tensor field [6]. An important property of the Swarzian is that S(f) = S(g) if and only if g(x) = (af(x) + b)/(cf(x) + d) with ad \u2212 bc 6= 0. It is interesting to note that if \u03c81(x) and \u03c82(x) represent two linearly independent solutions of the general Sturm-Liouville equation\n\u03c8\u2032\u2032(x) + p(x)\u03c8\u2032(x) + q(x)\u03c8(x) = 0 (3a)\n\u2217 golamali.sekh@knu.ac.in\nand\nf(x) = \u03c81(x)\n\u03c82(x) , (3b)\nthen\nS(f(x)) = \u2212 1\n2 p(x)2 + 2q(x)\u2212 p\u2032(x). (4)\nFor p(x) = 0, (3a) corresponds to the time-independent Schro\u0308dinger equation with q(x) as the potential function. Using p(x) = p\u2032(x) = 0 in (4) we see that the Schwarzian reconstructs the potential. Assuming\n\u03c8(x) = u(x)v(x) (5)\nas a complete solution of (3) it is straightforward to write the equation in the normal form\nv\u2032\u2032(x) + \u03bb(x)v(x) = 0 (6)\nwith \u03bb(x) = S(f(x))/2. This shows that when the first derivative is removed from the Sturm-Liouville equation the coefficient of the dependent variable is equal to half the Schwarzian derivative. Apparently, this simple fact has remained un-noticed in the literature. One of our objectives in this work is to exploit this fact to demonstrate the appearance of Schwarzian derivative in higher-order equations in the Riccati chain[7]. As regards our other point of interest, we show that higher-order Schwarzian derivatives[8] lead, in a rather natural way, to a hierarchy of nonlinear differential equations and examine if these equations could be converted to the Riccati form. In section 2 we introduce the equations in the Ricatti chain and point out that each equation in the chain can be reduced to the linear form. We then show that the set of linear equations so obtained provides a basis to visualize how the Schwarzian derivative enters into the Ricatti equations. In section 3 we introduce the higher-order Schwarzian derivatives for normalized univalent functions\n2 as considered in ref. [8]. In a relatively recent publication [9], the first-order Ricatti equation was realized in the context of a Schwarzian equation provided by the derivative as introduced through Eq.(1). In the same way, we obtain nonlinear equations associated with higher-order Schwarzian derivatives and suggest a method to reduce theme to the Riccati form. Finally, in section 4 we summarize our outlook on this work and try to make some concluding remarks."

            "text": "The Riccati equation represented by [10]\nd\u03c9(x)\ndx + \u03b1(x) + \u03b2(x)\u03c9(x) + \u03c9(x)2 = 0 (7)\nis the only nonlinear differential equation that is of Painleve type [11]. It appears in many different fields of physics and mathematics [12\u201314] and can be linearized using the Cole-Hopf transformation [15, 16]\n\u03c9(x) = \u03c6\u2032\n\u03c6 (8)\nto write\n\u03c6\u2032\u2032(x) + \u03b2(x)\u03c6\u2032(x) + \u03b1(x)\u03c6(x) = 0. (9)\nThus the Schwarzian derivative of (9) will be of the same form as that in (4) with p(x) = \u03b2(x) and q(x) = \u03b1(x). As expected, if (9) is expressed in the normal form removing the first derivative by the use of \u03c6(x) = u(x)v(x) then the coefficient of v(x) will be half of the Schwarzian derivative of (9). Following Grundland and Levi [7] we write the n-th order equation in the Riccati chain as\nLn\u03c9(x) +\nn \u2211\ni=1\n\u03b1i(x)(L i\u22121\u03c9(x)) + \u03b10(x) = 0. (10)\nHere n denotes the order of the Riccati equation and L stands for a differential operator represented by\nL = d\ndx + c\u03c9(x). (11)\nThe transformation in (8) re-written as \u03c9(x) = \u03c6\u2032(x)/c\u03c6(x) converts the equation in (10) into a linear ordinary differential given by\nn \u2211\ni=0\n\u03b1i(x) di\u03c6(x) dxi + dn+1\u03c6 dxn+1 = 0. (12)\nThe second-order Riccati equation and corresponding linear equation obtained by using n = 2 in (10) and (12) are\n\u03c9\u2032\u2032(x) + (3cf(x) + \u03b12(x))\u03c9 \u2032(x) + c\u03b12(x)\u03c9(x)\n2\n+c2\u03c9(x)3 + \u03b11(x)\u03c9(x) + \u03b10(x) = 0 (13)\nand\n\u03c6(3)(x) + \u03b12(x)\u03c6 \u2032\u2032(x) + \u03b11(x)\u03c6 \u2032(x) + c\u03b10(x)\u03c6(x) = 0. (14) The space of solutions of (14) is three dimensional spanned by three linearly independent eigen functions, say, \u03c61(x), \u03c62(x) and \u03c63(x). This tends to pose some problem to construct the Schwarzian corresponding to (14). Clearly, the same is true for other equations in the hierarchy. However, the appearance of the Schwarzian derivative in the second-order Riccati equation can be seen as follows. Making use of \u03c6(x) = u(x)v(x) in (14) we get\nv(3)(x) + a22(x)v \u2032\u2032(x) + a23(x)v \u2032(x) + a24(x)v(x) = 0, (15)\nwhere\na22(x) = \u03b12(x) + 3u\u2032(x)\nu(x) , (16a)\na23(x) = \u03b11(x) + 2\u03b12(x)u \u2032(x)\nu(x) +\n3u\u2032\u2032(x)\nu(x) (16b)\nand\na24(x) = c\u03b10(x) + \u03b11(x)u \u2032(x) u(x) + \u03b12(x)u \u2032\u2032(x) u(x) + u(3)(x)\nu(x) (16c)\nWe now choose u(x) such that a22(x) = 0. This gives\nu(x) = e\u2212 1 3 \u222b \u03b12(x)dx. (17)\nFrom (15) and (17) we find\nv(3)(x) + b23(x)v \u2032(x) + b24(x)v(x) = 0 (18)\nwith\nb23 = \u03b11(x) \u2212 \u03b12(x)\n2\n3 \u2212 \u03b1\u20322(x) (19a)\nand\nb24 = c\u03b10(x)\u2212 \u03b11(x)\u03b12(x)\n2\n3 \u2212\n2\u03b12(x) 2 27 \u2212 \u03b1\u2032\u20322 3 . (19b)\nEquation (18) represents a third-order linear differential equation with the second derivative removed and this result has been found from the second-order Riccati equation. It is easy to see that the coefficient b23 of v\u2032(x) in (18) stands for the Schwarzian derivative of the Sturm-Liouvlle equation (3) with p(x) = 2\u03b12(x)/3 and q(x) = \u03b11(x)/3. This is how the Schwarzian derivative appears in the second-order Riccati equation. The expression for b24, the coefficient of v(x) in (18) involves the second-order derivative of \u03b12(x) and thus it appears that b24 is unlikely to have any connection with Schwarzian. We, however found that the combination (b24(x) \u2212 b \u20322 3 (x)/3)/\u03b12(x) under the constraint\n3 \u03b1\u20321(x) = 3c\u03b10(x) represents a Schwarzian of (3) with p(x) = 2\u03b12(x)/3 and q(x) = \u03b12(x)/2. The third-order Riccati equation is given by\n\u03c9(3)(x) + (4c\u03c9(x) + \u03b13(x))\u03c9 \u2032\u2032(x) + (6c2\u03c9(x)2\n+3c\u03b13(x)\u03c9(x) + \u03b12(x))\u03c9 \u2032(x) + 3c\u03c9\u2032(x)2\n+c3\u03c9(x)4 + c2\u03b13(x)\u03c9(x) 3\n+c\u03b12(x)\u03c9(x) 2 + \u03b11(x)\u03c9(x) + \u03b10(x) = 0.\n(20)\nThe corresponding linear equation reads\n\u03c6(4)(x) + \u03b13(x)\u03c6 (3)(x) + \u03b12(x)\u03c6 \u2032\u2032(x)\n+\u03b11(x)\u03c6 \u2032(x) + c\u03b10(x) = 0.\n(21)\nWhen the third derivative term in (21) is removed we get\nv(4)(x) + b33(x)v \u2032\u2032(x) + b34(x)v \u2032(x) + b35(x)v(x) = 0 (22)\nwith\nb33(x) = \u03b12(x) \u2212 3\u03b13(x)\n2\n8 \u2212\n3\u03b1\u20323(x)\n2 , (23a)\nb34(x) = \u03b11(x)\u2212 \u03b12(x)\u03b13(x) 2 + \u03b13(x)\n3\n8 \u2212 \u03b1\u2032\u20323 (x) (23b)\nand\nb35(x) = c\u03b10(x) \u2212 \u03b11(x)\u03b13(x) 4 + \u03b12(x)\u03b13(x)\n2\n16 \u2212\n3\u03b13(x) 4\n256\n\u2212 \u03b12(x)\u03b1\n\u2032 3(x)\n4 +\n3\u03b13(x) 2\u03b1\u20323(x)\n32 +\n3\u03b1\u20323(x) 2\n16 \u2212 \u03b13(x)\n3\n4 . (23c)\nThe expression for the coefficient b33(x) of v \u2032\u2032(x) in (22) involves only the first derivative of \u03b13(x). Thus , as in the case of second Riccati equation, the result for b33(x) represents a Schwarzian derivative corresponding to (3) with p(x) = \u03b13(x)/2 and q(x) = \u03b12(x)/6. From b33(x) and b 3 4(x) we have verified that under the constraint \u03b1\u20322(x) = 3\u03b11(x)/2 the quantity (b 3 4(x)\u2212 2b \u20322 3 (x))/\u03b13(x) is a Schwarzian\u2212\u03b12(x)+\u03b13(x) 2/4+\u03b1\u20323(x). The method applied for the second- and third-order equations can easily be adapted to look for the presence of Schwarzian derivative in still higher-order Riccati equations.\n3.Ricatti equations from higher-order Schwarzians\nThe higher-order-Schwarzian derivatives are defined inductively [8] by\n\u03c3n+1(f) = \u03c3(f) \u2032 \u2212 (n\u2212 1)\nf \u2032\u2032\nf \u03c3n(f), n \u2265 3.

From (24) we can easily deduce\n\u03c34(f) = f (4)(x)\nf \u2032(x) \u2212 6\nf \u2032\u2032\u2032f \u2032\u2032\nf \u20322 + 6\n(\nf \u2032\u2032\nf \u2032\n)3\n, (25a)\n\u03c35(f) = f (5)\nf \u2032 \u2212 10\nf (4)f \u2032\u2032\nf \u20322 \u2212 6\n(\nf \u2032\u2032\u2032\nf \u2032\n)2\n+ 48 f \u2032\u2032\u2032f \u2032\u20322\nf \u20323 \u2212 36\n(\nf \u2032\u2032\nf \u2032\n)4\n, (25b)\n\u03c36(f) = f (6)\nf \u2032 \u2212 15\nf \u2032\u2032f (5)\nf \u20322 \u2212 22\nf \u2032\u2032\u2032f (4)\nf \u20322\n+ 108 f \u2032\u20322f (4)\nf \u20323 + 132\nf \u2032\u2032(f (3))2\nf \u20324\n\u2212 480 f \u2032\u20323f (3)\nf \u20324 + 288\nf \u2032\u20325 f \u20325 , (25c)\nand similar results for still higher-order Schwarzian derivatives. If we denote the pre-Schwarzian derivative f \u2032\u2032(x)/f \u2032(x) by y(x) the Schwarzian equation [17]\nS(f(x)) = \u2212g(x) (26)\nwith g(x) as an external source function leads to the nonlinear equation\ny\u2032(x) + 1\n2 y(x)2 \u2212 g(x) = 0. (27)\nEquation (27) was identified as Ricatti equation presumably because it could be linearized by Cole-Hopf transformation [15, 16]. We feel that it will be interesting to examine if equations similar to that in (26) written using higher-order Schwarzians lead to higher-order Ricatti equations . To that end we first begin with (25a) and write the nonlinear equation for the pre-Schwarzian derivative y(x) as\ny\u2032\u2032(x) \u2212 3y\u2032(x)y(x) + 3y(x)3 + g1(x) = 0. (28)\nIt is straightforward to see that the Cole-Hopf transformation y(x) = \u2212\u03c8\u2032(x)/\u03c8(x) reduces (28) in the linear form such that this nonlinear equation is, in fact, the second-order Ricatti equation. In respect of this the nonlinear equations constructed by using \u03c3i(f) for i \u2265 4 tend to pose problem. In the following we demonstrate this by dealing with \u03c35(f). The relation in (25b) leads to the nonlinear equation\ny(3)(x) \u2212 6y\u2032\u2032(x)y(x) \u2212 3y\u2032(x)2 + 12y\u2032(x)y(x)2\n\u2212 3y(x)4 + g2(x) = 0. (29)\nThe transformation used for linearizing (28) reduces (29) to the form\n\u03c8(4)(x)\n\u03c8(x) +\n2\u03c8\u2032(x)\u03c8(3)(x)\n\u03c8(x)2 \u2212 g2(x) = 0. (30)\nThus we infer that the nonlinear equation (29) when appended by \u22122\u03c8\u2032(x)\u03c8(3)(x)/\u03c82(x) (expressed in terms of y(x) and derivatives of y(x)) will give the third equation in the Riccati chain. Similarly, the fourth-order Riccati\n4 equation can be obtained from the nonlinear equation (following from \u03c36(f) )\ny(4)(x) \u2212 10y(x)y(3)(x) \u2212 12y\u2032(x)y\u2032\u2032(x)\n+ 36y(x)2y\u2032\u2032(x) + 36y(x)y\u2032(x)2 \u2212 60y\u2032(x)y(x)3 + 12y(x)5 + g3(x) = 0 (31)\nby adding \u22124\u03c8\u2032(x)2\u03c8(3)(x)/\u03c8(x)3 \u2212 2\u03c8\u2032(x)(\u03c8(3)(x))2 \u2212 5\u03c8\u2032(x)\u03c8(4)(x)/\u03c8(x)2 to it. The higher-order Schwarzian derivatives as used in this work were proposed by Schippers [8] to fit the flow that satisfies the Loewner differential equation [18]. In addition, Aharanov [19] and Tamanoi [20] gave two different definitions to introduce the higher-order analogues of the Schwarzian derivative. In particular. Aharanov gave the necessary and sufficient condition for a non-constant meromorphic function on the unit disc to be univalent in terms of his Schwarzian, on the other hand, Tamanoi studied combinatorial structures of his Schwarzians. We have checked and verified that derivatives provided by the Scippers\u2019 scheme are more suitable for the present study. In the above we have seen that he Schwarzian equations formed by using \u03c3n for n \u2265 5 tend to exhibit some deviation from the corresponding Riccati equations. However, one can choose appropriate weight factors for the numerical coefficients in higher-order Schwarzian equations to reduce them in the Riccati form. For example, such reduced equations corresponding to (29) and (31) are given by\ny(3)(x) \u2212 4y(x)y\u2032\u2032(x)\u2212 3y\u20322(x) + 6y(x)2y\u2032(x)\n\u2212 y(x)4 + g2(x) = 0 (32)\ny(4)(x) \u2212 5y(x)y(3)(x)\u2212 10y\u2032(x)y\u2032\u2032(x)\n+ 10y(x)2y\u2032\u2032(x) + 15y(x)y\u2032(x)2 \u2212 10y(x)3y\u2032(x) + y(x)5 + g3(x) = 0. (33)\nThe equations (32) and (33) can be linearized by using\ny(x) = \u2212\u03c8\u2032(x)/\u03c8(x) to read\n\u03c8(4)(x) \u2212 g2(x)\u03c8(x) = 0\nand \u03c8(5)(x)\u2212 g3(x)\u03c8(x) = 0 (34)\nrespectively such that (32) and (33) indeed represent the third and fourth equations in the Riccati chain."

            "text": "In the present work we examined the connection between the Schwarzian derivative and higher-order equations in the Riccati chain. We achieved this by removing the n-th order derivative term from the (n + 1)-th order linear differential equation associated with n-th order Riccati equation. About fifty years ago such a reduced equation was considered by Kim [21] in order to look for some generalization of the Schwarzian derivative. We note that the generalized derivatives so obtained lead to highly complicated expressions for the coefficients of firstand zeroth-order derivative terms of a third-order equation. As opposed to this we derived a transparent method to demonstrate how the so-called traditional Schwarzian derivative enters into the higher-order equations of the Riccati Chain. In the above context we also noted that there are three well known methods [8, 18, 19] to introduce higher-order Schwarzian derivatives. But we found it convenient to work with the definition of Schippers [8] and thus provided an approach to realize the equations in the Riccati chain using inductively generated hierarchy of higherorder Schwarzian derivatives."
