    "abstractText": "The formulation of plant extracts in phospholipid vesicles is a promising strategy to exploit their biological properties while solving problems related to poor solubility in water, high instability, and low skin permeation and retention time. In this study, Ceratonia siliqua ripe pods were used for the preparation of a hydro-ethanolic extract, which showed antioxidant properties owing to the presence of biologically active compounds identified by liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (e.g., hydroxybenzoic acid and flavonoid derivatives). To improve the applicability of the extract in therapy, a topical formulation based on liposomes was explored. The vesicles were characterized by small size (around 100 nm), negative charge (\u221213 mV), and high entrapment efficiency (>90%). Furthermore, they displayed both spherical and elongated shapes, with oligolamellar structure. Their biocompatibility was demonstrated in cells, including erythrocytes and representative skin cell lines. The antioxidant activity of the extract was proved by the scavenging of free radicals, the reduction of ferric ions, and the protection of skin cells from oxidative damage.",

            "text": "Ceratonia siliqua L., commonly called carob, is an evergreen tree that belongs to the Leguminosae family widely cultivated in Mediterranean countries [1]. Traditionally, carob has been used to produce animal feed. Nowadays, agricultural and industrial sectors exploit carob fruit and its primary products (i.e., flour, powder, and syrup) to develop a variety of foods and beverages [2]. The fruit is a brown pod with an elongated and compressed shape of varying dimensions and a wrinkled surface that becomes leathery when ripe. The pods are mainly made up of sweet edible pulp with a leathery outer layer (pericarp) and a softer inner area (mesocarp), rich in hard seeds [3]. Carob pulp contains a wide range of biologically active compounds [4]. Generally, carob pods have a high sugar content, relatively low content of lipids and protein, and some essential amino acids (aspartic and glutamic acids), as well as\u03c9-3 and\u03c9-6 fatty acids (oleic, linoleic, and \u03b1-linolenic acids). Moreover, the fruit contains a high amount of low-calorie dietary fibers (cellulose,\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 1209. https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox12061209 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/antioxidants\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 1209 2 of 19\nhemicelluloses, and lignin), minerals (calcium, phosphorus, and potassium), and phenolic compounds [2,5]. The phenolic content is mainly represented by gallic acid; the other phenolic compounds are myricetin rhamnocyte, quercetin rhamnocyte, methyl gallate, cinnamic acid, and myricetin glycoside [3,6,7]. Carob pods show significant pharmacological activities (anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antidiabetic, antihypercholesterolemic, hepatoprotective, neuroprotective, and nephroprotective) [1,4,8\u201310]. Traditional medicine used carob pods for the treatment of human gastrointestinal diseases. Several studies showed that carob pods could be useful for the attenuation of processes related to chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome [11]. They exert beneficial effects on dyslipidemia and interfere with glucose absorption mechanisms [12\u201314]. Many of these activities are related to the inhibiting potential of oxidant species [15]. In this study, the antioxidant activity of a hydro-alcoholic extract obtained from ripe carob pods was studied with the aim of a possible utilization on the skin. As is known, free radicals significantly contribute to skin damage and accelerate ageing by disrupting the body\u2019s defenses and restoration mechanisms [16]. The topical application of natural compounds with antioxidant activity is often limited by poor aqueous solubility, high chemical instability, and low skin permeation. The nanoformulation of plant extracts in phospholipid vesicles is a promising strategy to overcome these drawbacks and exploit their biological properties. Therefore, the antioxidant properties of the C. siliqua hydroalcoholic extract, both free in solution and formulated in liposomes, were investigated. The antioxidant studies were performed in vitro by spectrophotometric assays (DPPH and FRAP), and by assessing the prevention of hydrogen-peroxide-induced oxidative damage in fibroblasts and keratinocytes. In addition, the biocompatibility of the nanoformulations was evaluated in cell models (i.e., erythrocytes and skin cells)."

The antioxidant activity (AA) of the extract samples was calculated according to the following Formula (2):\nAA(%) = ( ADPPH \u2212 Asample\nADPPH\n) \u00d7 100 (2)\nThe results were expressed also as Trolox equivalents (\u00b5g TE/mL solution) calculated by using a calibration curve (Trolox concentration range: 0\u2013500 \u00b5g/mL). The ferric ion reducing antioxidant power, or FRAP, is based on the reduction of the Fe3+-TPTZ (iron-2,4,6-tripyridyl-S-triazine) complex, under acidic conditions, to the intense blue-colored ferrous complex Fe2+-TPTZ, which causes an increase in absorbance. FRAP reagent was prepared by mixing 0.3 mM TPTZ and 20 mM FeCl3 \u00d7 6H2O in 0.2 M acetate buffer (pH 3.6). The sample (10 \u00b5L) was added to a 2 mL FRAP reagent and incubated at room temperature for 4 min in the dark; the absorbance was read at 593 nm. The results, expressed as \u00b5g Fe2+ equivalents/mL solution, were calculated by using a calibration curve (FeSO4 concentration range: 13.9\u20132502 \u00b5g/mL)."

            "text": "The biocompatibility was assayed through the hemolytic activity evaluation according to a procedure described in the literature [26]. The C. siliqua extract samples were dissolved in a total volume of 1 mL with phosphate buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) and 25 \u00b5L of an erythrocyte suspension. Erythrocytes were isolated from rabbit blood samples supplied by the animal facility of the Research and Development Center (CID)\u2014Spanish National Research Council (CID-CSIC, Barcelona, Spain). The blood samples were collected in strict compliance with the bioethical principles established by the Spanish legislation. The study was approved by the Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee of the Research and Development Center (CEEA-CID, CSIC). The erythrocytes were washed three times in PBS and resuspended in PBS at a cell density of approximately 109 cells/mL. The assay was performed using 50 and 100 \u00b5L of an extract solution (20 mg/mL in 70:30 v/v ethanol:water) or liposomes (20 mg/mL), and 0% and 100% hemolysis controls (erythrocytes in PBS and in ultrapure water, respectively). Empty liposomes were also assayed for a proper comparison. The samples were incubated for 10 min at room temperature, under stirring, and then centrifuged (5 min at 10,000 rpm). Hemolysis (%) was calculated as a function of the absorbance at 575 nm of the supernatant of the C. siliqua samples in comparison with that of the controls. The biocompatibility of C. siliqua samples was also tested in three skin cell lines. Murine Swiss albino fibroblasts (3T3), immortal human keratinocytes (HaCaT), and squamous carcinoma cells (A431) were provided by Celltec UB (Barcelona, Spain). The cells were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM) high glucose (4.5 g/L) with 10%\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 1209 5 of 19\n(v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 \u00b5g/mL streptomycin under standard conditions (37 \u25e6C, 5% CO2). The cells were trypsinized when approximately 80% confluent and seeded into 96-well plates (3T3 and HaCaT cells at 1 \u00d7 105 cells/mL, A431 cells at 5 \u00d7 104 cells/mL). After 24 h, the medium was removed, and the cells were incubated for another 24 h with C. siliqua extract in solution (70:30 v/v ethanol:water) or in liposomes, previously diluted with the culture medium to achieve the required concentrations (1\u2013200 \u00b5g/mL). Empty liposomes were also tested for a proper comparison. After the incubation time, the medium was removed and cell viability was tested by the MTT assay, which relies on the ability of living cells to convert yellow MTT (2,5-Diphenyl-3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl) tetrazolium bromide) into purple formazan. A total of 100 \u00b5L of MTT (5 mg/mL in PBS then diluted (1:10 v/v) with DMEM without phenol red nor FBS) was added to the cells. After 3 h, the MTT was removed and 100 \u00b5L of dimethylsulfoxide was added to dissolve the formazan crystals. The absorbance of the solutions was read at 550 nm using a Bio-Rad 550 microplate reader (Hercules, CA, USA). The cell viability results were expressed as the percentage of the MTT reduction in treated cells with respect to untreated control cells (100% viability)."

Peak 2, with [M\u2212H]\u2212 at m/z 169.01476, was absolutely identified as gallic acid by comparing with its commercial standard. Peaks 1 and 4, with [M\u2212H]\u2212 at m/z 331, were attributed to gallic acid glucosides [5,29]. Peaks 5, 12, and 24, with [M-H]\u2212 at m/z 483.0783, were attributed to different digalloyl-glucose isomers, and peaks 26, 30, and 33, with [M-H]\u2212 at m/z 635.0888, to trigalloyl-glucose isomers.

Peak 32, with [M-H]\u2212 at m/z 197.0460, was consistent with ethyl gallate [32], but a comparison with the pure commercial standard excluded this attribution and the peak was attributed to a ethyl gallic acid derivative. Peak 29, with [M-H]\u2212 at m/z 595.1309, was attributed to a digalloyl derivative [5], tentatively siliquapyranone [29]. Peak 34, with [M-H]\u2212 at m/z 401.1095, and peak 40, with [M-H]\u2212 at m/z 507.11438, were attributed to gallic acid derivatives [5]. Peak 35, with [M-H]\u2212 at m/z 121.02935, was attributed to benzoic acid [31]. Hydroxybenzoic acids were the most abundant compounds in the extract, accounting for 7.19 \u00b1 0.37 mg/g dr. Compounds 1, 2, and 34 were the most abundant, and the sum of monogalloyl dihexosides (0.81 \u00b1 0.04 mg/g dr) was higher than both sums of digalloyl glucose and trigalloyl glucose isomer (0.43 \u00b1 0.02, and 0.44 \u00b1 0.03 mg/g dr, respectively).\nSeven peaks were attributed to flavonoid derivatives.

            "text": "C. siliqua pods are known for their antioxidant properties that are of value for the amelioration and prevention of many disorders [33,34]. In the literature, there are many studies comparing different extraction methods to prepare an active extract. The solvent concentration, the extraction time, and the extraction temperature are the parameters that most influence the phytochemical profile of the extracts [15,35,36]. Generally, the ethanol\u2013water mixtures have been found to be effective for the antioxidants\u2019 extraction from botanical materials [36]. In this study, a C. siliqua pod extract was prepared through sonication and maceration in a 70:30 (v/v) ethanol\u2013water mixture. DPPH and FRAP tests showed a prominent antioxidant activity of the prepared extract, which may be related to the high content of hydroxybenzoic acids, especially gallic acid and its derivatives [37\u201339]. The total concentration of the phenolic compounds detected in C. siliqua pod extract was ~7.56 mg/g of dried extract, with hydroxybenzoic acids accounting for ca. 95% (7.19 mg/g of dried extract). The C. siliqua pod extract efficiently neutralized the DPPH radicals. Similarly, the FRAP assay showed the strong reducing power of the extract.\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 1209 16 of 19\nThese antioxidant abilities were retained after the nanoformulation process. The latter was performed to increase the bioavailability of the extract components and to produce a formulation feasible for topical application. The liposomes were small in size, with spherical and elongated shapes and oligolamellar arrangement. They entrapped key phenolic compounds with high efficiency and were applied safely in different cell cultures. The strong antioxidant capacity highlighted by colorimetric tests did not translate into an equally strong protection from H2O2-induced oxidative stress in cellular systems. These discrepancies can be related to the differences between chemical methods (DPPH and FRAP assays) and biological systems using living cells. In addition, the cell response was found to depend on the cell line. The morphological and physiological properties of the cells could explain differences in their sensitivity. Accordingly, while keratinocytes are an example of cells representative of the epidermis, fibroblasts are found in the dermal skin layer. For this reason, 3T3 cells are more sensitive than HaCaT or A431 cells to the deleterious effect of hydrogen peroxide. Interestingly, in the case of tumoral cells (A431), the pretreatment with the extract in liposomes was more effective than in the other cell lines. Klenow et al. showed that a treatment with C. siliqua extract reduced DNA damage in human colon cells challenged with hydrogen peroxide [40]. No other results were found in the literature about the C. siliqua pod extracts\u2019 ability to prevent H2O2-induced cytotoxicity, but their ability to prevent or reduce oxidation and inflammation-related disorders are known. \u00dcnal et al. highlighted the antioxidant capacity of a carob pod aqueous extract against deltamethrin-induced oxidative stress, a pesticide widely used around the world, in vitro and in vivo in a zebrafish model [41]. Similarly, \u00c7avus\u0327og\u0306lu et al. evaluated the protective property of C. siliqua pod extract against toxicity induced by 1,4-dioxane, a common contaminant present in many industrial products [6]. Al-Olayan et al. investigated the ameliorative effects of C. siliqua pod aqueous extract on liver fibrosis and oxidative stress in mice infected with Schistosoma mansoni, a parasite responsible for an excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that induces hepatic stress. The treatment of infected mice with the extract increased hepatic GSH contents (the main endogenous antioxidant) and restored the activities and expression levels of the antioxidant enzymes SOD, CAT, GST, GPx, and GR [42]. Alzoubi et al. showed that a methanolic extract of carob pods prevented the impairment of short-term memory induced by chronic stress in rats, probably as a result of a prevented reduction in brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels in the hippocampus [10]. Ben Ayache et al. analyzed the phytochemical profile of aqueous extracts prepared from Tunisian varieties of carob. The study showed that carob extracts may be implicated in several pathways, contributing to antioxidant activity by means of their bioactive components. The extracts exhibit potent radical scavenging properties, resulting in analgesic activity in mice and proapoptotic capacity in different cancer cell lines [8]. Nevertheless, it is important to underline that none of the above studies involved the use of liposomes. This strengthens the potential of our findings and the need for further investigation."
