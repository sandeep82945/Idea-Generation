            "text": "microsimulation. The microsimulation allowed us to estimate the development of educational inequalities in MDD with a synthetic cohort of 500,000 individuals followed from ages 18 to 65, and to assess the potential benefit of intervening on quality of social contacts, health literacy, and smoking. Results: On average, an additional 19.1% of individuals with low education will ever experience MDD between ages 18 and 65 compared to those with high education (32.0% vs 12.9%, respectively). Additionally, individuals with low education generally will develop MDD 0.9 years earlier (35.6 years vs 36.5 years, respectively) and spend 1.2 years more with MDD (6.2 years vs 5 years, respectively), than individuals with high education. Improving the quality of social contacts in individuals with low education would have the largest impact; it would reduce the inequalities in the prevalence, onset, and duration of MDD by an average of 18.4%, 18.3%, and 28.6%, respectively. Conclusions: Intervening on modifiable factors, especially quality of social contacts, in individuals with low education could help reduce the large estimated educational inequalities in MDD over the life course. Key messages: There are large educational inequalities in major depressive\ndisorder (MDD) over the life course, especially with regard to the life course prevalence of MDD. Improving quality of social contacts, and to a lesser extent health literacy and smoking behaviours, amongst individuals with low education may help reduce the inequalities in MDD.\nAbstract citation ID: ckac129.265 Risk factors for mental health disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain: A cohort study\nPere Castellvi\nA Miranda-Mendizabal1, J Piqueras1, P Castellv\u0131\u03011, S A\u0301lvarez1, S D\u0131\u0301az1, L Go\u0301mez1, S Recoder2, N Sa\u0301nchez1, E Garc\u0131\u0301a Dura\u0301n1, CG Forero1 1School of Medicine, Universitat Internacional de Catalunya, Sant Cugat del Valle\u0300s, Spain 2Department of Basic Sciences, Universitat Internacional de Catalunya, Sant Cugat del Valle\u0300s, Spain Contact: pcastellvi@uic.es"

            "text": "Data comparing the populations\u2019 mental health from before, during and after the pandemic is needed. We aim to assess the risk factors for the first-onset and persistence of major depressive disorder (MDD) and suicidal thoughts and behaviours (STB) during the first year of the pandemic among the Spanish general population. Methods: Cohort study through two online surveys from before the pandemic (N = 2,005, October/November 2019) and 12- months later (N = 1,357) on an adult Spanish, nationally representative, population-based sample. Multiple logistic regression models were used to assess the association between socio-demographic, COVID-19 related variables and healthcare received during the pandemic with the onset and persistence of MDD and STB. Results: Women have more than 3-fold risk for the onset (OR 3.18; CI95% 1.40 -7.22) and persistence (OR 8.62; CI95% 1.74- 42.48) of MDD. Studying and working at the same time (OR 10.13; CI95% 2.17-47.35) and having close relatives/friends with COVID-19 infection (OR 14.84; CI95% 1.91-115.18) or death (OR 5.26; CI95% 1.56-17.73) due to COVID-19 are risk factors for MDD onset. Sick-leave (OR 17.19; CI95% 2.65- 112.56) and unemployment (OR 7.01; CI95% 1.85-26.43) increased the risk for MDD persistence. Death of friends/ colleagues due to COVID-19 (OR 8.40; CI95% 1.47-48.07)\nincreased the risk for STB onset, and being on sick-leave (OR 7.91; CI95% 1.80-34.66) for STB persistence. Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic, women were consistently more at risk of having worse mental health than men. Direct and indirect consequences caused or aggravated by the pandemic are common risk factors for the increased risk for the onset and persistence of both MDD and STB. Identification of high-risk subgroups and risk factors for MDD and STB among the Spanish general population will allow the developing and implementing of evidence-driven strategies for reducing the long-term impact of the pandemic in populations\u2019 mental health. Key messages: The pandemic consequences, whether due to having had\nCOVID-19, having close people affected or who have died from the infection and the social consequences increase the risk for worse mental health. Evidence-driven strategies for reducing the long-term impact of the pandemic in populations\u2019 mental health should be a public health priority.\nAbstract citation ID: ckac129.266 Are loneliness interventions effective in reducing loneliness? A meta-analytic review of 128 studies\nMathias Lasgaard\nM Lasgaard1, C L\u00f8vschall1, P Qualter2, LM Laustsen1,3, MH Lim4, HT Maindal5, AS Hargaard1, J Christensen1,6 1Public Health and Health Services Research, Defactum, Central Denmark Region, Aarhus, Denmark 2Manchester Institute of Education, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK 3Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark 4Iverson Health Innovation Research Institute, Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, Australia 5Department of Public Health, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark 6Department of Psychology, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark Contact: mathias.lasgaard@stab.rm.dk\nLoneliness is widely acknowledged as a growing public health concern, accelerated by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, our knowledge about the effectiveness of interventions to reduce loneliness across the lifespan, including knowledge of different intervention strategies, is limited. This preregistered systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effect of interventions to reduce loneliness. The systematic review identified 136 studies. The meta-analysis included 128 studies comprising 54 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (n = 6,379), 23 multi-cohort studies (n = 2,882) and 48 single-cohort studies (n = 3,009). A small to moderate statistically significant effect was detected (RCTs; SMD = -0.47, multi-cohort studies; SMD = -0.24, single cohortstudies; SMD = -0.42). Using the GRADE system, confidence in the estimates was assessed as low or very low, implying that the estimates may potentially be higher or lower. No statistically significant differences were found between age groups. Psychological treatment, social support interventions, and social and emotional skills training appeared to be the most effective intervention strategies in reducing loneliness but there is currently no strong reason to prefer one intervention strategy over another. Further analyses demonstrated that the long-term effects (i.e., one to six months after the intervention) were comparable to the short-term effects (i.e., up to four weeks after the intervention). Findings from the current metaanalyses provide overall evidence of the effectiveness of loneliness interventions. Given methodological limitations, including the heterogeneity of the reviewed studies, it remains unclear who the interventions would help the most. Overall, there is a need for rigorous and high-quality development and evaluations of interventions for loneliness.\now nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /eurpub/article/32/Supplem ent_3/ckac129.265/6766052 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 17 January 2024"
