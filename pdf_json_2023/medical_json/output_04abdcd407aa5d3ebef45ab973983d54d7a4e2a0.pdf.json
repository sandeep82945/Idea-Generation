Gartner1,2,3, Calvin Vary1,2,3 and Michaela R. Reagan1,2,3*\n1MaineHealth Institute for Research, Scarborough, ME, United States, 2University of Maine Graduate School of Biomedical Science and Engineering, University of Maine, Orono, ME, United States, 3Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, United States, 4University of New England, Biddeford, ME, United States\nThe unique properties of the bone marrow (BM) allow for migration and proliferation of multiple myeloma (MM) cells while also providing the perfect environment for development of quiescent, drug-resistant MM cell clones. BM adipocytes (BMAds) have recently been identified as important contributors to systemic adipokine levels, bone strength, hematopoiesis, and progression of metastatic and primary BM cancers, such as MM. Recent studies in myeloma suggest that BMAds can be reprogrammed by tumor cells to contribute to myeloma-induced bone disease, and, reciprocally, BMAds support MM cells in vitro. Importantly, most data investigating BMAds have been generated using adipocytes generated by differentiating BM-derivedmesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) into adipocytes in vitro using adipogenic media, due to the extreme technical challenges associated with isolating and culturing primary adipocytes. However, if studies could be performed with primary adipocytes, then they likely will recapitulate in vivo biology better than BMSC-derived adipocytes, as the differentiation process is artificial and differs from in vivo differentiation, and progenitor cell(s) of the primary BMAd (pBMAds) may not be the same as the BMSCs precursors used for adipogenic differentiation in vitro. Therefore, we developed and refined three methods for culturing pBMAds: two-dimensional (2D) coverslips, 2D transwells, and three-dimensional (3D) silk scaffolds, all of which can be cultured alone or with MM cells to investigate bidirectional tumor-host signaling. To develop an in vitro model with a tissuelike structure to mimic the BM microenvironment, we developed the first 3D, tissue engineered model utilizing pBMAds derived from human BM. We found that pBMAds, which are extremely fragile, can be isolated and stably cultured in 2D for 10 days and in 3D for up to 4 week in vitro. To investigate the relationship between pBMAds and myeloma, MM cells can be added to investigate physical\nfrontiersin.org01\nFrontiers in Oncology\nrelationships through confocal imaging and soluble signaling molecules via mass spectrometry. In summary, we developed three in vitro cell culture systems to study pBMAds and myeloma cells, which could be adapted to investigate many diseases and biological processes involving the BM, including other bone-homing tumor types.\nKEYWORDS\nmyeloma, bone marrow adipose, 3D, silk scaffolds, tissue engineering, adipocytes"

            "text": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant B cell neoplasm characterized by uncontrolled growth of mutated plasma cells within the bone marrow (BM) (1, 2). Overt (symptomatic) myeloma results in BM infiltration and a disconnect in the normal equilibrium between osteoblastic (bone building) and osteoclastic (bone breakdown and resorption) activities with a skew toward net bone loss. The unique properties of the BM allow for migration and proliferation of MM cells while also providing a supportive environment for evolution of quiescent, drug-resistant cells (3). Recently, therapies that target the marrow microenvironment rather than the tumor cells directly have proven to be effective in inhibiting tumor growth and osteolysis (4\u20136). In addition to osteoblasts and osteoclasts, other cells in the BM niche affect MM progression, including osteocytes (7), BMderived mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) (8), and BM adipocytes (BMAds), as we and others have shown (9\u201311).\nBMAds are important contributors to systemic adipokine levels (12), as well as regulators of bone (13) via RANKL expression (14) and hematopoiesis via stem cell factor (SCF) production (15), and have recently been implicated in bone metastatic cancers such as acute myeloid leukemia (16) and breast cancer (17). Interestingly, BM adipose tissue (BMAT) expands with aging and obesity (18, 19), which are the two key risk factors for MM (20\u201322), suggesting that BMAds interact with and influence myeloma cells in the marrow. Indeed, adipocyte-derived factors such as monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF1) are known chemotactic factors for myeloma cells (9, 23), whereas other factors promote myeloma proliferation (e.g., leptin) (10) and resistance to chemotherapies (e.g., leptin and adipsin) (11). Although these effects of physiologically normal adipocytes on myeloma cells have begun to be characterized, how cancer-associated adipocytes differ from healthy adipocytes (17, 24, 25) and whether these changes can be tied to disease progression is poorly understood.\nHere, we built on our prior work examining the effects of myeloma cells on BMAds derived from BMSCs (26\u201328) to\n02\ndevelop techniques to isolate, culture, and characterize primary BMAds (pBMAds). Our work was motivated by the knowledge that cells differentiated in vitro are not identical to the terminally differentiated cell type isolated directly from the body. This can be due to the potential effects of differentiation media, artificial/two-dimensional (2D)/monoculture conditions devoid of the correct microenvironmental signals or the incorrect progenitor cell being used based on assumptions or technical difficulties in obtaining or determining the true in vivo progenitor cell (29, 30). Although the analysis of pBMAds isolated and processed immediately from BM has been described (31, 32), protocols for the collection of pBMAds are still relatively novel, and, as such, very few studies utilizing cell culture and experimentation with pBMAds in vitro have been described previously. Indeed, prior publications outline experiments utilizing pBMAds in vitro in which pBMAds were grown in culture medium\u2013filled flasks for \u201cceiling\u201d or \u201cfloating\u201d cultures (33\u201335), in transwells (34), or on coverslips (36), but only one study performed pBMAd co-culture with tumor cells (37), and none performed this in a three-dimensional (3D) system.\nThus, we further developed and utilized three methods of in vitro culture of pBMAds [using 2D ceiling coverslips, 2D ceiling transwells, and 3D silk scaffolds (27, 38)], which can be used for mono- or co-cultures with MM or other tumor cells to investigate bidirectional tumor-host signaling. Many findings demonstrating that, using 3D cultures and matching material substrate, more closely resembling the mechanical and physical properties seen in vivo, improves accuracy in modeling tumors in vitro (39\u201341). Thus, we developed an in vitromodel with a 3D, tissue-like structure to mimic the BM microenvironment, which represents the first 3D model utilizing human pBMAds. Using the methods that we developed, we found that the fragile pBMAds can be isolated and stably cultured in 2D for 2 weeks and in 3D for up to 4 weeks in vitro. To investigate the relationship between pBMAds and myeloma disease progression, MM cells were added to the cultures and analyzed for cell phenotype and localization, using confocal imaging, and the effects on soluble signaling molecules via\nfrontiersin.org\nmass spectrometry. In summary, we developed three in vitro cell culture systems to study pBMAds and myeloma cells, which could be adapted to investigate many diseases and biological processes involving BMAds."

Day 9: Harvest media and/or cells as described under\n\u201cTechniques to Characterize the Co-cultures.\u201d\nTechniques to characterize pBMAd-MM co-cultures\nThese co-culture systems allow for the determination of several parameters for both cell types. First, we used RealTime-Glo (Figure 4B) and CellTiter-Glo (Figure 5A) to establish viability of the pBMAds grown in culture, and exogenous luciferin to determine any potential changes in luciferase-expressing MM cell numbers in response to co-culture, as described in the results\nB\nA\nFIGURE 3 Long-term 3D culture of primary bone marrow adipocytes.

To examine potential differences in gene expression, we utilized the 2D transwell co-culture system to ensure separation of the two cell types prior to RNA isolation. Next, we used imaging techniques [fluorescence (Figure 5B) and confocal microscopy (Figure 6)] to identify both cell types and determine whether these cell types were physically interacting in the 3D BM-like coculture. To assess the soluble signals secreted by pBMAds and MM cells alone and how these signals change in co-culture systems, we utilized mass spectrometry for an unbiased, whole proteomics approach, as described in the results section below. For the experiments executed in this manuscript, media from 2D transwell co-cultures (top and bottom portions) or 3D scaffold co-cultures (Figures 7\u20139) were collected at day 9 (at the end of the 72-h co-culture period) for the analysis of secreted proteins (proteomics). Each cell type was also collected from either side of the transwell for RNA analysis; 2 six-well plate wells were pooled together per cell type. These methods should be adapted as needed and could be employed at any time point during co-culture. Below, days represent various points from the \u201cco-culture assembly\u201d protocols above.\nFrontiers in Oncology 09\nDetermination of cell number in 2D co-culture\n1. Culture pBMAds and MM cells in 24-well transwell co-\nculture system for 72 h as described above.\n2. On day 9 of the study (72 h of co-culture), separate\nmyeloma cells from pBMAds to quantify cell number.\n3. For myeloma cells, gently scrape cells from the top\nportion of the transwell with a pipette and transfer 200 \u00b5l of cell culture per well into a white BLI plate.\na. To quantify MM.1S cells or other cells with constitutively expressed luciferase, add 10 \u00b5l of luciferin to culture in BLI plate, wait 5 min, and read on a plate reader.\nb. To quantify RPMI-8226 cells or other cells that do not express luciferase, add 100 \u00b5l of CellTiter-Glo to culture in BLI plate, wait 5 min, and read on a plate reader.\n4. To collect pBMAds:\na. Gently scrape the underside of the transwell membrane with a flat cell scraper and deposit adipocytes into media underneath transwell by dipping the membrane gently inside following scraping.\nb. Gently mix the culture by pipetting, and select pBMAd liquid culture from the same place in each well.\nc. Deposit 200 \u00b5l of pBMAds into a white BLI plate.\nd. Add 100 \u00b5l of CellTiter-Glo to pBMAds, wait 5 min,\nand read on a plate reader.\nDetermination of cell viability over time and collection of conditioned media in 3D scaffolds using CellTiter-Glo\nFor investigation of cell viability over time in our 3D scaffolds, we used two products from Promega: RealTime-Glo and CellTiter-Glo. The RealTime-Glo reagent can be added per the manufacturers\u2019 instructions (https://www.promega.com/ products/cell-health-assays/cell-viability-and-cytotoxicityassays/realtime_glo-mt-cell-viability-assay/?catNum=G9711) at day 0 and read consecutively and reliably for up to 72 h. No additional reagents or media are required after seeding. With RealTime-Glo samples, the plate was returned to the cell culture incubator between readings instead of discarded, which allowed us to track adipocytes on individual scaffolds over time. The steps below outline a general procedure for assessment of cell viability using CellTiter-Glo, which was one method used in this manuscript and requires at least one scaffold per time point of interest as this assay is a destructive endpoint.\n1.

Then, a sample of the pBMAds were removed and transferred to a white plate for CellTiter-Glo analysis using a plate reader (A). To assess tumor cell numbers, tumor cells in the top of the transwells were scraped gently with a pipette, and a sample was transferred to white 96-well BLI plates.

Of note, each donor exhibited a slightly different adipocyte phenotype in 2D and 3D cultures, and even within donors, different regions of slides or scaffolds showed variable phenotypes, demonstrating biological heterogeneity of this depot.\nIn 3D, a long-term term culture was achieved up to 3 (Figures 3A, 4A; Supplementary Figure 2) and 4 weeks (Figure 3B);\nTABLE 1 Patient bone marrow donor information.\nDonor ID Number\nFigure/Supplementary Figure Number/Use\nDonor Sex\nDonor Age\nRace Diagnosis BMI (kg/ m2)\nR21-0306 Figure 5; Supplementary Figures 6, 7 Transwell proteomics\nM 62 Caucasian Primary osteoarthritis of right hip\n30.27\nR21-0400 Figure 5; Supplementary Figure 6 Transwell culture\nM 66 Caucasian Degenerative joint disease left hip\n25.09\nR21-0460 Figure 5; Supplementary Figures 6, 7 Transwell proteomics\nF 70 Caucasian Primary osteoarthritis of left hip 29.29\nR21-0512 Figure 5; Supplementary Figure 7 Transwell culture and coverslip\nM 69 Caucasian Primary osteoarthritis of right hip\n24.74\nR21-0518 Figure 5; Supplementary Figures 6, 7 Transwell proteomics\nF 76 Caucasian Primary osteoarthritis of right hip\n24.45\nR21-0687 Figures 3, 4A; Supplementary Figure 2 Long-term 3D\nF 70 Caucasian Primary osteoarthritis of left hip 34.33\nR21-0828 Figures 7\u20139; Supplementary Figure 8 3D proteomics \u201cDonor 1\u201d\nF 79 Caucasian Primary osteoarthritis of right hip\n38.67\nR21-0982 Figure 6 3D Scaffold Imaging\nM 69 Caucasian Primary osteoarthritis of right hip\n31.14\nR21-1039 Figure 1; Supplementary Figures 4\u20136; Coverslip and transwell culture; 3D scaffold imaging\nM 61 Unknown Primary osteoarthritis of left hip 28.66\nR21-1054 Supplementary Figure 3 3D Scaffold Imaging\nM 65 Caucasian Primary osteoarthritis of left hip 33.46\nR21-1114 Figure 5 Transwell co-culture\nF 73 Caucasian Primary osteoarthritis of right hip\n21.13\nR22-0211 Figure 4B 3D pBMA RealTime-Glo\nM 63 Caucasian Primary osteoarthritis of left hip 27.89\nR22-0313 Figure 4B 3D pBMA RealTime-Glo\nF 19 Caucasian Primary osteoarthritis of the left hip\n24.69\nR22-0353 Figure 4B 3D pBMA RealTime-Glo\nF 63 Caucasian Primary osteoarthritis of the right hip\n40.03\nR22-1189 Figures 7\u2013; Supplementary Figures 5, 8 3D proteomics \u201cDonor 2\u201d\nF 70 Caucasian Primary osteoarthritis of the left hip\n30.93\nR22-1192 Figures 7\u20139; Supplementary Figures 5, 8 3D proteomics \u201cDonor 3\u201d\nF >89 Caucasian Osteoarthritis of the right hip 33.71\nf rontiersin.org\nlive/dead confocal imaging showed the presence of live cells (green), as well as red clusters (which could be dead cells or autofluorescent extracellular lipids; Figure 4A). We also developed a second method to determine whether pBMAds were alive on scaffolds by using RealTime-Glo, a non-destructive reagent. At seeding, pBMAds from two donors (R22-0211 and R22-0353) were allowed to incubate on scaffolds for 1 h at 37\u00b0C, whereas pBMAds from another donor (R220313) were incubated for only 30 min at room temperature on the scaffolds, prior to adding media containing RealTime-Glo. At 24, 48, and 72 h after seeding, a stronger signal was seen from pBMAds that were allowed more time to attach to the scaffold before filling wells with media (Figure 4B). (Note: Seventy-two hours was the longest; RealTime-Glo was recommended for use by Promega, but it still gave signal, providing evidence of cell survival, until day 11.) These data demonstrate differences between donors and incubation times and represent a non-invasive assessment tool for pBMAds over time in 3D culture.\nWe next utilized our cell culture systems to investigate the relationship between pBMAds and myeloma cells. Using CellTiter-Glo for pBMAds (Figure 5A) and luciferin spike-in for luciferase-expressing MM.1S (Figure 5B), we quantified viability of cells alone or after co-culture (after removing transwells and scraping cells). We also analyzed phenotype differences in pBMAds in response to MM cells by imaging coverslips. Interestingly, not only adipocytes but also stromal cells could be observed in ceiling cultures of pBMAds, as seen in donor R211114 (pBMAds alone, bottom left image, Figure 5C). Similar images were seen with pBMAds with or without RPMI-8226 cells (Supplementary Figure 3). Overall, the variability in imaging of coverslips both between donors and in different fields of view within a single donor impeded our ability to quantify changes in adipocyte size or other phenotypic effects in pBMAds. With further development of the coverslip method, more quantitative data should be available using different imaging methods. We were also able to culture MM cells (white arrows indicate MM cells) with pBMAds in 3D scaffolds, as seen with donor R21-0982 (Figure 6) and donor R21-1039 (Supplementary Figure 4). Although quantification was difficult, we were able to see that pBMAds adhered to scaffolds after 7 days in culture alone, and MM cells adhered to scaffolds in pBMAd co-cultures 3 days after seeding MM.1S cells. MM.1S cells were also adherent to the scaffold alone when grown in monoculture. Viability was quantified in scaffolds for each cell type alone and in co-culture using CellTiter-Glo bioluminescence (Supplementary Figure 5).\nUtilizing qRT-PCR and proteomic analysis to characterize pBMAds and MM cells in vitro\nWe next explored gene and protein-level characteristics of pBMAs. RNA was successfully isolated from pBMAds from the\nFrontiers in Oncology 16\n72-h, transwell co-culture systems, although there were challenges yield and donor variability. We predicted a suppressive effect of MM co-culture on the expression of mature adipocyte marker fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) (Supplementary Figure 6A) consistent with our prior studies in BMSC-derived BMAds (26), or changes in CXCL1 or TGFB, but this was not observed. Because BMSC-derived adipocytes have been shown to regulate dexamethasone resistance in myeloma (11, 26), we also investigated the expression of two genes involved in glucocorticoid receptor trafficking in MM cells previously found to be upregulated in MM cells by BMAds (TSC22D3 and FKBP5); no differences in response to pBMAd co-culture relat ive to MM cells alone were found (Supplementary Figure 6B), suggesting differences between pBMAds and BMSC-derived BMAds in their relationship with myeloma cells, which warrants further study.\nNext, to investigate the relationship between pBMAds and MM cells, we collected CM from pBMAds alone, MM cells alone, and the co-culture, in our 2D transwell system and performed proteomic analysis via mass spectrometry on these three groups. We detected a total of 293 proteins across the three sample types, which were used to perform the PCA (Supplementary Figure 7A), which showed distinct groupings. A total of 16 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs; defined to be significant if p < 0.05 by t-test, |log2FC|>0.17) were detected (Supplementary Figure 7B). These included proteins elevated in MM.1S alone, compared with pBMAds alone (PGAM4, NIPBL, AFM, KMT2B, and EEF1A2), and those elevated in pBMAds compared with MM.1S alone (SPARC) (Supplementary Table 1). Co-culture CM contained elevated proteins (AFP and FMOD) and decreased proteins (FABP1 and TAF4B) compared with pBMAd alone CM (Supplementary Table 2). Five proteins were also significantly increased, and two decreased, in the co-culture condition compared with MM.1S cells alone (Supplementary Table 3). MM cell-induced changes in adipocyte protein secretion profiles may suggest novel vulnerabilities in the cancer microenvironment, which can be explored in future work.\nNext, we analyzed CM from cells grown in 3D silk scaffolds. Having detected so few significant proteins in our 2D transwell system, we used additional replicates for each pBMAd donor (three pBMAd donors in total) and analyzed each donor separately. For each donor, CMs from three individual scaffolds were submitted (as technical replicates) for pBMAds alone, MM.1S alone, and co-culture conditions, and each donor was considered one biological replicate. Differences and similarit ies were observed between donor pBMAds (Supplementary Figure 8A). In our first experiment (donor 1 pBMAds, Supplementary Tables 4\u20136), 264 proteins were de tec t ed in the CMs and used to per fo rm PCA (Supplementary Figure 8B). There were 35 DEPs between the groups (Figure 7A) in this experiment. In the second experiment\nfrontiersin.org\nusing 3D scaffolds, we used two pBMAd donors (donor 2 and donor 3; Supplementary Figure 8C), and 108 proteins were detected in the CM samples in the groups. In donor 2 (Supplementary Tables 7\u20139), 39 DEPs were found with upregulation of PZP and IGLC3 in the co-culture compared with either cell type alone (Figure 7B). In donor 3 (Supplementary Tables 10\u201312), 48 DEPs were found (Figure 7C) including IGLC3 and AFP- two proteins that were found as significant in co-culture samples using other donors. Across all three donors, there were four proteins commonly differentially expressed: IGKC, VIM, FGA, and ITIH3.\nVimentin (VIM) was the only protein that was consistently elevated in all three pBMAd donors (versus MM.1S alone) in 3D cultures (Figure 7, arrows; Supplementary Tables 4, 7, 10), whereas the many other changed DEPs were identified but more donor-dependent. Among the three pBMAd donors, there were a total of 55 proteins significantly elevated in pBMAd cultures compared with media alone [for this analysis only, we used a more stringent fold change cut off (FC > 1.2) and p < 0.05 due to the number of proteins identified]. These proteins were enriched for members of the complement cascade and included proteins involved in glycolysis/ gluconeogenesis (Figure 8), as well as other carbon metabolism or lipid droplet-related proteins. Having observed such differences between donors in the pBMAds alone (Supplementary Figure 8), we assessed and analyzed proteins changed in the 3D co-culture CM relative to the pBMAd donor media or relative to MM.1S control media (Figures 9). Here, we noted similarities to the pBMAds alone in terms of enriched molecules, with additional KEGG pathways highlighted in the co-culture from pBMAd donor 3 (Figure 9, bottom). Caution should be exercised when comparing between 2D and 3D pBMAd proteomic results, as differences could arise from different donors, media, nutrient diffusion, cell densities, cell contact, substrate stiffness, or extracellular matrix peptide signaling from silk proteins that could affect cellular adhesion or spreading. In summary, the combination of these pBMAdMM co-culture systems (in both 2D and 3D) with proteomics assessment of CM can provide new insights into the secreted factors from pBMAds and reveal novel signaling mechanisms between these fragile cells and other cell types within the BM microenvironment."

            "text": "In this protocol, we reveal a new method to maintain pBMAds in 3D culture and create co-cultures of pBMAds with myeloma cells to recapitulate the cancer/BM microenvironment. Our methods help address the current challenges of obtaining and culturing pBMAds, which are fragile and difficult to access\nFrontiers in Oncology 17\nand thus challenging to study in vitro or ex vivo. We integrate findings from our prior research, which generates BMATmodels by differentiating MSCs from adipocytes on silk scaffolds (27) and isolating and culturing primary white adipocytes on silk scaffolds (38), to the optimal methods here in isolating pBMAds (43). This led to the new methods for culturing and imaging pBMAds and co-culturing these with other cell types. In our 3D silk scaffold pBMAd model, we were able to detect live pBMAds over time using RealTime-Glo reagent, as well as differences between donors and with different incubation times (Supplementary Figure 2). Future experiments should utilize this system to detect differences in pBMAds in response to tumor cell co-culture or tumor cell CM to further investigate potential effects of tumor cells on pBMAd energy production and/or cell number. These methods can be combined with luciferase- or green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing tumor cell lines for relative quantification of both cell types, similar to what we have described previously (27). Further optimization of different media compositions to support both cell types in culture could also be considered; here, we used both standard culture media for myeloma cells (transwell and coverslip cultures) and standard culture media for pBMAds (3D), so direct comparison between the various systems should be done with caution.\nLimitations of this study include donor-to-donor variability in samples, challenges in availability/number donors (healthy, non-myeloma donors and myeloma patient donors) and difficulty in isolating RNA from pBMAds, as we experienced unusually low RNA yields using standard techniques. While we were able to isolate a small amount of total RNA from these samples and amplify higher abundance targets such as housekeeping genes [ACTB and RPLP0 (data not shown)] and highly expressed adipocyte markers (FABP4), we were only able to amplify other desirable targets in two of the four donor samples examined. Utilization of alternative methods to avoid saturating RNA binding columns with lipid, and avoidance of trizol-based extraction reagents (35, 44, 45) would likely improve yield in future studies. Further development of these methods is required to improve the utility of working with these cells in culture and to advance the field. However, the utilization of proteomics-based analyses allowed us to steer away from these limitations and further investigate the relationship between myeloma cells and BMAds. T-test comparisons for proteomics data were executed using either GraphPad Prism or MarkerView software, which is specifically designed for the handling of mass spectrometry data; however, future studies could implement more stringent statistical comparisons including false discovery rate correction.\nAlthough we did not utilize these methods, ImageJ or other software platforms can be used to quantify adipocytes and measure lipid droplet size in both 2D and 3D cultures. To\nfrontiersin.org\ncharacterize the effects of pBMAd co-culture on MM cells in 3D culture, magnetically activated cell sorting can be implemented to gently collect CD138+ cells after rinsing tumor cells off the scaffolds, for downstream analyses including flow-based apoptosis, proliferation, and cell cycle assays. Alternatively, more targeted approaches , such as enzyme-l inked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), could be used to specifically examine the effects on soluble adipokines and signaling molecules present in CM.\nProteomic analysis of CM collected from single-cell types (pBMAds or MM cell lines) or cells in co-culture revealed a wealth of new information about secretory factors and potential signaling molecules produced by these cells. In 2D transwell cocultures, we detected elevated levels of AFP and fibromodulin (FMOD). Elevated AFP levels have been associated with metabolic syndrome (46), and stromal cells differentiating into adipocytes (47, 48) suggesting that mature BMAds may also produce this protein and it may be upregulated upon exposure to myeloma cells. The extracellular matrix protein FMOD, which is also increased in transwell co-cultures relative to the pBMAds alone, regulates BMSC differentiation through regulation of the BMP2 pathway, modulating chromatin structure to provide access for the RUNX2/PPARG transcription factors to bind and regulate BMSC lineage commitment (49). Critically, FMOD is not expressed in myeloma cells (50), suggesting that this protein does indeed come from the pBMAd cultures. Together, these two data points suggest either that there is stromal contamination in the co-culture system (and that these stromata are responding to the myeloma cells) or that myeloma cells might stimulate de-differentiation of adipocytes in culture. Future studies should interrogate this.\nIn 3D culture, we were able to detect levels of the intermediatesized filament VIM in the culture media from all 3 pBMAd donors. Interestingly, lipid droplets in adipocytes are often biochemically associated with VIM, with VIM attaching to perlipins inside the cell (51, 52) and may be involved in lipid trafficking (51). Studies have linked VIM to exosomes derived from adipocyte progenitors (53, 54), which could account for the presence of this protein in the CM from pBMAds. Indeed, recent studies suggest that adipocytederived exosomes may protect MM cells from chemotherapyinduced apoptosis (55), and although we did not directly look for exosomes in the media, we did find a number of cytoskeletalassociated proteins in the pBMAds alone and the co-culture media, which could be consistent with the presence of exosomes.\nIn donor 1, three proteins were significantly upregulated in the co-culture condition compared with either cell type alone including LDHB, YWHAZ, and EEF1A2. LDHB is upregulated in cancer associated adipocytes in the breast cancer microenvironment, suggesting that cancer cells, including myeloma cells, could modulate lactate metabolism in the\nFrontiers in Oncology 18\nmicroenvironment (56)\u2014a process that might be critical in patient responses to carfilzomib (57). In the 3D co-culture using cells from donor 2, PZP and IGLC3 were significantly upregulated compared with both cell types alone. Although PZP may play a role in energy conversion in adipocytes (58), very little is known about its role in either cell type tested in our experiments. Interestingly, LAC3 (Iglc3) was upregulated in extracellular vesicles derived from the BM of myeloma-bearing mice, compared with control extracellular vesicles (59), and is involved in complement activation (59). In the CM from the donor 3 co-culture scaffolds, we observed significant differences in 14 proteins compared with both cell types alone, including IGLC3 and AFP\u2014two proteins that were also significant in coculture samples using other donors.\nOur data from pBMAds add to the burgeoning datasets, suggesting that these cells, once thought of as static, space-filling cells, may be critical regulators of bone, angiogenesis, and immune function. Our preliminary investigation comparing transwell co-cultures and 3D silk scaffold cultures suggests that pBMAds likely secrete different factors based on their culture method; future directions should continue to optimize culture conditions of these fragile cells for use in vivo. In addition, future studies should include a side-by-side comparison of BMSCderived BMAds with pBMAds to better understand any potential differences between the two in vitro. Utilization of larger primary samples (perhaps from amputations, cadavers, etc.) would also be beneficial in future studies to increase the signal strength in RNA and proteomic analyses.\nWe found that pBMAds can be grown in both ceiling cultures (using the undersides of coverslips and of transwells as the ceiling substrates for adhesion) and in 3D silk scaffolds. Both culture systems can be used to detect secreted molecules, investigate tumor cell-adipocyte interactions, and visualize phenotypic changes in cells. These models will help researchers to investigate tumor-adipocyte microenvironment and bidirectional signaling between the cells, which may lead to the development of new therapies or avenues for intervention in cancer progression. In summary, we provide methods to ease the use of pBMAds rather than BMSC-derived adipocytes that can lead to more translationally relevant findings to efficiently investigate how adipocytes support tumor cells and how tumor cells hijack BMAds for their own purposes."
