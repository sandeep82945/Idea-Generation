Exploring Scalable Algorithms for Computing DEF-k Allocations: Given the computational hardness of finding minimal k for DEF-k allocations, a promising research direction is developing scalable heuristics or approximation algorithms that can efficiently compute near-optimal DEF-k allocations. These algorithms could leverage insights from machine learning, optimization, and parallel computing to handle larger instances and varied valuation structures.

Generalization to Mixed Valuation Domains: Extending the concept of dubious chores to mixed domains where agents may value items both positively (goods) and negatively (chores) could open new avenues for research. Investigating how dubious items influence allocations in such mixed domains, especially in terms of fairness and efficiency, would provide a more comprehensive understanding of fair division under complex preferences.

Dynamic and Adaptive Allocation Mechanisms: Exploring dynamic allocation mechanisms that adjust to changing preferences or new information about chores could be highly relevant, especially in applications like task allocation in dynamic environments. Research could focus on adaptive algorithms that update allocations over time to maintain DEF-k fairness and Pareto optimality despite changes in the environment or agent preferences.

Experimental Studies on Human Perception of Dubious Chores: Conducting experimental studies to understand how humans perceive the fairness of allocations involving dubious chores could provide valuable insights into the practical applicability of DEF-k allocations. These studies could investigate factors that influence perceptions of fairness and satisfaction in different contexts, such as household chores, workplace tasks, or community responsibilities.

Theoretical Bounds and Properties of DEF-k Allocations: Further theoretical investigation into the bounds, uniqueness, and stability of DEF-k allocations could enrich the understanding of these concepts. Research could explore conditions under which DEF-k allocations exhibit particular desirable properties (such as envy-freeness, efficiency, or strategy-proofness) and the implications of these properties for the design of fair division mechanisms.
