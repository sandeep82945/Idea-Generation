    "abstractText": "We consider two-component fermions with a zero-range interaction both in two and three dimensions and calculate the bulk viscosity for an arbitrary scattering length in the high-temperature regime. We evaluate the Kubo formula for the bulk viscosity using an expansion with respect to the fugacity, which acts as a small parameter at high temperatures. In the zero-frequency limit of the Kubo formula, pinch singularities emerge that reduce the order of the fugacity by one. These singularities can turn higher-order vertex corrections at nonzero frequencies into the leading order at zero frequency, so that all such contributions have to be resummed. We present an exact microscopic computation for the bulk viscosity in the high-temperature regime by taking into account these pinch singularities. For negative scattering lengths, we derive the complete bulk viscosity at second order in fugacity and show that a self-consistent equation to resum the vertex corrections is identical to a linearized kinetic equation. For positive scattering lengths, a new type of pinch singularity arises for bound pairs. We show that the pinch singularity for bound pairs leads to a first-order contribution to the bulk viscosity, which is one order lower than that for negative scattering lengths, and that the vertex corrections also provide first-order contributions. We propose a new kinetic equation for bound pairs that derives from a self-consistent equation to resum the vertex corrections.",

            "text": "The bulk viscosity is one of the fundamental transport coefficients in hydrodynamics, which determines the dissipation during isotropic expansion [1, 2]. One intriguing property of the bulk viscosity is that it vanishes in conformal fluids because they can expand isotropically without dissipation [3]. On the contrary, the nonvanishing bulk viscosity serves as an indicator of breaking conformal invariance in various systems [4, 5]. For example, a dilute two-dimensional Fermi gas is scale invariant classically, but this scale invariance is broken by quantum fluctuations leading to a quantum scale anomaly, which is theoretically predicted [6\u20138] and experimentally observed via the isotropic expansion and contraction mode (breathing mode) [9\u201311].\nIn this study, we consider a two-component Fermi gas realized in ultracold atoms, which provides an ideal ground to study strongly correlated quantum many-body systems owing to the tunability of the interparticle interaction via the Feshbach resonance [12, 13]. This system has the universality that the interaction effect appears only through the scattering length, and its universal properties have been actively explored not only in thermodynamics but also in transport phenomena [14]. In particular, the system shows nonrelativistic conformality in the unitary limit [15\u201317]. The vanishing bulk viscosity at unitarity was confirmed experimentally [18].\nOne simple approach to compute the transport coefficients is the kinetic theory founded on the quasiparticle approximation [19\u201327]. However, while kinetic theory is capable of predicting the high-temperature behavior of the shear viscosity and the thermal conductivity of short-range interacting Fermi gases, the quasiparticle approximation does not capture all relevant contributions to the bulk viscosity at high temperatures [28]. As another approach in the high-temperature regime, the transport coefficients can be calculated from the Kubo formula in the quantum virial expansion, whose expansion parameter is the fugacity [29\u2013 36]. In the zero-frequency limit of the Kubo formula, there is the pinch singularity due to a particle-hole excitation with vanishing energy and momentum exchange [37\u201340]. The pinch singularity reduces the order of the fugacity by one and changes the power counting with respect to the fugacity, so that a resummation is required. The shear viscosity and the thermal conductivity were computed with an approximate resummation [29, 30, 32, 33], and their exact resummation was shown to be equivalent to solving the linearized Boltzmann equation [41]. On the other hand, the bulk viscosity has not yet been calculated taking this singularity into account. The purpose of this paper is to give an exact microscopic computation of the bulk viscosity in the high-temperature regime by taking into account the pinch singularity.\nBefore we dive into the details, we give a brief summary of the results of this paper for the bulk viscosity. We evaluate the bulk viscosity in the high-temperature regime, where the fermion fugacity z \u2261 e\u03b2\u00b5 is small and serves as an expansion parameter with \u03b2 the inverse temperature and \u00b5 the fermion chemical potential, respectively [42]. We consider two-component fermions with a short-range interaction that is characterized by an s-wave scattering length a. At positive scattering length a > 0 there exists a two-body bound state of two distinct fermions forming a bound pair. In this work, we focus on the fermion-dominated regime where the pair fugacity zpair = z 2e\u03b2/(ma 2) is smaller than the fermion fugacity z. The parameter region in fugacity and interaction where this expansion applies is schematically shown in Fig. 1. In the following we discuss the bulk viscosity separately for negative scattering lengths, when there is no two-body bound state, and for positive scattering lengths when the bound state is present. At negative scattering length in three dimensions the bulk viscosity \u03b6 \u223c z2/\u03bb3T is of second order in fugacity z with the thermal de Broglie\nwavelength \u03bbT \u2261 ~ \u221a\n2\u03c0\u03b2/m, as plotted in the left panel of Fig. 2. We find that the bulk viscosity is divided into two contributions, \u03b6 = \u03b6pair + \u03b6fermion, where \u03b6pair and \u03b6fermion are computed as\n\u03bb3T \u03b6pair = z 2 2 \u221a 2 9\u03c0 v2 [ \u22121\u2212 (1 + v2)ev2Ei(\u2212v2) ] , (1)\nand\n\u03bb3T \u03b6fermion = z 2 v\n2\n384 \u221a 2\n[ 2 ( 4 + 9v2 + 2v4 ) + \u221a \u03c0ev 2 v ( 15 + 20v2 + 4v4 ) erfc(\u2212v) ]2 2\u2212 v2 + v4 + v6ev2Ei(\u2212v2)\nv\u21920\u2212\u2192 z 2v2\n12 \u221a 2 ,\n(2)\nwith dimensionless interaction parameter v \u2261 \u03bbT /( \u221a 2\u03c0a) = ~ \u221a \u03b2/ma\u22121. The pair contribution was computed previously from the contact correlation function [30\u201332] without vertex corrections. We find that vertex corrections contribute at the same order in fugacity due to the pinch singularity and give rise to the additional fermionic contribution \u03b6fermion. The fermion contribution at resonant interaction, \u03bb3T \u03b6fermion(v \u2192 0) = z2v2/12 \u221a 2, agrees with a previous result from fermionic kinetic theory [25], but the extension to all scattering lengths a is new. We show that both \u03b6pair and \u03b6fermion contributions individually are incomplete, and only together they yield the total bulk viscosity at leading order in fugacity.\nOn the other hand, at positive scattering length in both two and three dimensions, there are also bound states of pairs in addition to the scattering states of pairs included above. We show below that the bound pairs exhibit their own version of the pinch singularity that arises for pair-pairhole excitations at vanishing frequency and momentum exchange. This pair pinch singularity has a dramatic effect on the pair bubble contribution to the bulk viscosity, which is reduced by one order in fugacity and thus contributes to the bulk viscosity already at first order in z as \u03b6 \u223c ze\u03b2/ma2/\u03bb3T . This bound-pair term seems to dominate over the O(z2) contributions from scattering pairs and from fermions at high temperature. Furthermore, we find that the bound-pair vertex corrections are of the same order O(z) due to the pair pinch singularity, and therefore the vertex corrections are equally important and need to be resummed. We present a self-consistent equation to resum these vertex corrections. While the numerical solution of this self-consistent equation is difficult and the scaling of the bound-pair contribution to the bulk viscosity remains an open question, the combination of the Boltzmann equation for fermions with the kinetic equation for bound pairs provides a consistent description of transport in strongly correlated many-body systems with bound states.\nThe paper is structured as follows: In Section 2, we start with the general formulation of two-component fermions with a zero-range interaction and the Kubo formula for the bulk viscosity. Next, we briefly review an order counting method with respect to the fugacity in the quantum virial expansion. We then introduce two kinds of pinch singularities in the quantum virial expansion: the fermion pinch singularity and the pair pinch singularity. The fermion (pair) singularity appears in the product of fermion (pair) propagators. The fermion pinch singularity was introduced in Ref. [41] and enhances the contribution of on-shell fermions, whereas the pair pinch singularity is a new type of singularity and enhances the contribution of bound pairs. In Section 3, we discuss the bulk viscosity for negative scattering lengths. Since the system with a negative scattering length has no bound state and there is no pair pinch singularity, we only need to take into account the fermion pinch singularity. We present the complete result of the bulk viscosity up to second order in fugacity. In Section 4, we discuss the bulk viscosity for positive scattering lengths. We show that the bulk viscosity appears at first order in fugacity due to the pinch singularity, and derive a self-consistent equation for a vertex function to compute the first-order bulk viscosity. We also reduce the self-consistent equation to a kinetic equation for bound pairs by employing a simple approximation. Finally, Section 5 is devoted to a summary of this paper.\nOur study partially follows the analysis described in Ref. [41] and applies it to the bulk viscosity. In what follows, we will set ~ = kB = 1 and implicit sums over repeated spin indices \u03c3 = \u2191, \u2193 are assumed throughout this paper. The bosonic and fermionic Matsubara frequencies are denoted by \u03c9Bm = 2\u03c0m/\u03b2 and \u03c9Fm = 2\u03c0(m + 1/2)/\u03b2, respectively, for m \u2208 Z. Also, an integration over d-dimensional wave vector or momentum is denoted by \u222b p \u2261 \u222b dp/(2\u03c0)d for the sake of brevity."

Because the correlation function of a one-body operator is dominant for the shear viscosity and the thermal conductivity at high temperatures in contact interacting systems [29, 33, 41], the bulk viscosity is inherently different from the other transport coefficients.3\nFor later use, we note that the pressure fluctuations in Eq.

We see, in fact, that the terms proportional to the conserved quantities in Eq. (15) are essential in Eq. (49).\n3In long-range interacting systems, one-body operator correlation functions do not necessarily dominate for the shear viscosity and the thermal conductivity at high temperatures [17, 48, 49].\nwith\n\u03b4b (bound) 2 (\u03b2, a) =\n{ e\u03b2 B (d = 2),\n\u03b8(a) \u221a 2e\u03b2 B (d = 3), (21)\nand\n\u03b4b (scat) 2 (\u03b2, a) =  \u2212 \u222b \u221e 0 d\u03b5 \u03b5\ne\u2212\u03b2\u03b5\n[ln(ma2\u03b5)]2 + \u03c02 (d = 2),\n\u2212 1\u221a 2m\u03c0a \u222b \u221e 0 d\u03b5 e\u2212\u03b2\u03b5\u221a \u03b5(\u03b5+ B) (d = 3).\n(22)\nThese expressions separating the bound- and scattering-state contributions are consistent with the standard Beth\u2013Uhlenbeck expression for the second virial coefficient [50] and were derived for d = 2 in Refs. [27, 51, 52] and for d = 3 in Ref. [53].4"

            "text": "We compute the bulk viscosity via the imaginary-time-ordered correlation function in the quantum virial expansion. When we use the propagators in the Matsubara frequency representation, the fugacity appears through the expansion of the distribution function resulting from the Matsubara frequency summation. It is a little tricky to find the fugacity dependence in the Matsubara frequency representation before summing over the Matsubara frequency. For this reason, it is helpful to use the knowledge of the propagators in the imaginary time representation only when we count the order of diagrams. The bare fermion propagator in the imaginary-time representation has an explicit fugacity dependence,\nG(\u03c4,p) = \u2212e\u2212\u03c4( p\u2212\u00b5)[\u03b8(\u03c4)\u2212 fF ( k \u2212 \u00b5)] = \u221e\u2211 n=0 znG(n)(\u03c4,p) (23)\nwith\nG(n)(\u03c4,p) = { \u2212e\u2212\u03c4( p\u2212\u00b5)\u03b8(\u03c4) (n = 0), \u2212e\u2212\u03c4( p\u2212\u00b5) ( \u2212e\u03b2 p )n (n \u2265 1), (24)\nwhere fF (\u03b5) = 1/(e \u03b2\u03b5\u22121) is the Fermi distribution function and \u03b8(\u03c4) the step function. Using G(n)(\u03c4,k), we can directly provide the coefficients of each order for the fugacity in the quantum virial expansion. In fact, the diagrammatic computational method for the quantum virial expansion is established in the imaginarytime representation, not in the Matsubara frequency representation [53, 55]. In particular, the zeroth-order component G(0)(\u03c4,p) runs only in the forward direction for the imaginary time because it involves \u03b8(\u03c4). Thus, we can estimate the order of each diagram in the fugacity from the number of propagators going backward in imaginary time when an imaginary time is assigned to each vertex. In fact, each of the self-energy diagrams in the upper panel of Fig. 4 has just one propagator running backward in imaginary time (running from right to left). Nevertheless, we mainly employ the Matsubara frequency representation because it is more convenient than the imaginary-time representation for the resummation discussed later."

            "text": "In the zero-frequency limit of the Kubo formula, there emerges the product of the retarded and advanced propagators with the same frequency and momentum. For the fermion propagator, the product is decomposed into partial fractions as\nGR(\u03b5,p)GA(\u03b5,p) = Im[G R(\u03b5,p)]\nIm[\u03a3(\u03b5+ i0+,p)] , (25)\n4In three dimensions, the second virial coefficient can also be expressed simply as b2(\u03b2, a) = \u2212 1 4 \u221a 2 + 1\u221a 2\n( 1 +\nerf( \u221a \u03b2/ma\u22121) ) e\u03b2 B , which is a monotonic function of the inverse scattering length [31, 54].\nwith GR(\u03b5,p) = G(\u03b5+i0+,p) and GA(\u03b5,p) = G(\u03b5\u2212i0+,p). Because of Im[GR(\u03b5,p)] = \u2212\u03c0\u03b4(\u03b5\u2212 p+\u00b5)+O(z) and Im[\u03a3(\u03b5+ i0+,p)] \u223c O(z) in the high-temperature regime, the product is expressed as\nGR(\u03b5,p)GA(\u03b5,p) = \u03c0\u03b4(\u03b5\u2212 p + \u00b5)\u2212Im[\u03a3(\u03b5+ i0+,p)] +O(z 0), (26)\nand is proportional to the inverse of the fugacity. Thus, the appearance of the product (26) complicates the order counting in fugacity; this is the so-called pinch singularity [37\u201340]. The order counting discussed in the previous section is valid only at nonzero frequencies and is not valid in the zero-frequency limit due to the pinch singularity.\nWe now move on to discuss the pinch singularity of the pair propagator. In contrast to the bare fermion propagator GR(\u03b5,p), the inverse of the bare pair propagator DR(\u03b5,p) has a finite imaginary part,\nIm[DR(\u03b5,p)\u22121] = \u03b8(\u03b5\u2212 p/2 + 2\u00b5)\u00d7  m 4 (d = 2), m\n4\u03c0\n\u221a m(\u03b5\u2212 p/2 + 2\u00b5) (d = 3),\n(27)\nso that the product is decomposed into partial fractions as\nDR(\u03b5,p)DA(\u03b5,p) = Im[D R(\u03b5,p)]\nIm[\u2206(\u03b5+ i0+,p)]\u2212 Im[DR(\u03b5,p)\u22121] , (28)\nwith DR(\u03b5,p) = D(\u03b5+ i0+,p) and DA(\u03b5,p) = D(\u03b5\u2212 i0+,p).

This singularity appears only when the scattering length is positive and enhances the contribution of the bound pair whose energy is given by the sum of the kinetic energy p/2 \u2212 2\u00b5 and the binding energy \u2212 B . Our goal is to give the exact bulk viscosity taking into account the fermion and pair pinch singularities, Eqs. (26) and (31), respectively."

For diagrams to have a product of the fermion propagators with the same frequency and momentum in the zero-frequency limit, they must have the shape where the left and right sides are connected just by the two fermion propagators, which we refer to as the fermion-bubble shape. Among the infinite series of diagrams with O(z3), only the second term in Fig. 5, which we call the box diagram, has such a fermion-bubble shape. The box-diagram contribution at nonzero frequencies is given by\n\u03c7C;box(i\u03c9 B) =\n2\n\u03b2 \u2211 m \u222b p CF (i\u03c9Fm + i\u03c9 B , i\u03c9Fm;p)G(i\u03c9 F m + i\u03c9 B ,p)\n\u00d7G(i\u03c9Fm,p)CF (i\u03c9Fm + i\u03c9B , i\u03c9Fm;p), (35)\nwith\nCF (i\u03c9Fm + i\u03c9 B , i\u03c9Fm;p) \u2261\nm2\n\u03b2 \u2211 n \u222b q D(i\u03c9Bn + i\u03c9 B , q)D(i\u03c9Bn , q)G(i\u03c9 B n \u2212 i\u03c9Fm, q \u2212 p).

The product of the fermion propagators in Eq. (35) replaced by\nthe full propagators results in the fermion pinch singularity, so that the box-diagram contribution becomes O(z2) in the zero-frequency limit. Therefore, the box-diagram contributions need to be resummed. Since the fermion-bubble shape is the same as that of the diagrams providing the shear viscosity and the thermal conductivity at high temperatures [41], the box diagram allows us to find other contributions which have to be resummed. They are provided as diagrams in which the four-point functions for the Maki\u2013Thompson and Aslamazov\u2013Larkin types and their iterations are inserted between the vertex functions in the box diagram."

Since \u03d5(p) is O(z) we find that \u03b6fermion is of the same order as \u03b6pair.The resummation for the fermion pinch singularity is achieved by solving the selfconsistent equation for the vertex function depicted in the upper-right panel of Fig. 6.

(47) to have a solution, the on-shell vertex function \u03a0\u0303FRA(p) must be orthogonal to 1 and p, which correspond to the conserved particle number and the energy, respectively.

From the viewpoint of the kinetic theory, the orthogonality to each is necessary for \u03d5(p) to represent fluctuations around an equilibrium state with fixed particle number and energy.

Here, in each first equality, we substituted Eq. (17) into the pressure fluctuations of Eq. (37) and used the fact that the \u03b2 dependence of b2(\u03b2, a) in Eq. (20) is contained in \u03b4b (scat) 2 (\u03b2, a) at a negative scattering length. Also, in each second equality, the first term after integrating over all except the radial direction of the relative momentum is equal to the derivatives of \u03b4b (scat) 2 (\u03b2, a). Therefore, the pressure fluctuations, i.e., the second and third terms in Eq. (37), are essential for ensuring orthogonality and making the integrals (49) vanish. Note that these integrals become nonzero at positive scattering lengths because, in addition to the appearance of the pair pinch singularity, the second virial coefficient in the pressure fluctuation terms in Eq. (37) has the bound-state contribution. This means that the resummation discussed in this section is valid only as far as the bound-state contributions are negligible.\nIn particular, \u03a0\u0303FRA(p) for d = 3 near the unitary limit has the asymptotic form of\n\u03a0\u0303FRA(p) = z\n\u03c0\u03b2 \u03bbT a\n[ 4\n3\nFD( \u221a \u03b2 p)\u221a\n\u03b2 p \u2212 1 + 2 9 \u03b2 p\n] +O(z2, a\u22122), (50)\nwith FD(x) being the Dawson function and the use of the asymptotic form of the second virial coefficient b2 = 3/(4 \u221a 2)+\u03bbT /(\u03c0a)+O(a\n\u22122). In two dimensions, although the scattering length is always positive, near the free-fermion limit ( B \u2192 0), where the bound-state contribution is negligible, we can use the asymptotic expansion of the second virial coefficient [27],\nb2 = \u2212 1 4 \u2212 1 ln(\u03b2 B) +\n\u03b3\n[ln(\u03b2 B)]2 +O([ln(\u03b2 B)]\n\u22123), (51)\nwith \u03b3 = 0.577 . . . being Euler\u2019s constant, and \u03a0\u0303FRA(p) is given by\n\u03a0\u0303FRA(p) = z 2\n\u03b2\n1\n[ln(\u03b2 B)]3\n[ \u22122Ei(\u2212\u03b2 p) + 2 ln(\u03b2 p/2) + 1 + 2\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b2 p ] +O(z2, [ln(\u03b2 B)] \u22124), (52)\nwhere Ei(x) is the exponential integral. Eq. (50) is the same as Xp in Ref. [25], and Eq. (52) is also the same as Xp in Ref. [27].\n5 Therefore, \u03b6fermion agrees with the kinetic result in Refs. [25, 27]. Although \u03b6pair was calculated in Refs. [30\u201332] and \u03b6fermion in Refs. [25, 27], it is worth emphasizing that it is their sum that provides the complete bulk viscosity when only the fermion pinch singularity is relevant."

Since the parallel propagators can lead to pinch singularities, this classification is the key to considering the two types of the pinch singularities. We show the following two properties of the fermion\u2013pair four-point function Kf-p(\u2217): (i) Kf-p(\u2217) acquires an additional order in the iterations of the four-point functions, and (ii) Kf-p(\u2217) must be at least O(z) for the propagators on both sides to have the pinch singularities simultaneously."

When we refer to a\nfermion\u2013fermion four-point function having O(zn), we mean that the correlation function with that fourpoint function and O(z0) vertices has O(zn+1). Here, since the fermion-bubble shape diagram without four-point functions has a minimum order of z, the order of the fermion-fermion four-point function and its closed diagram differ by one. This order counting means that one order resulting from the propagator running backward is counted as that of the four-point function. We count Kf-p(\u2217) as including one order of fugacity from the propagator running backward. The orders of the other four-point functions are defined similarly according to Fig. 7.\nBased on the order counting method discussed in Section 2.3 and the definition of the order of the fourpoint functions, we find that the iterations of the four-point functions contribute at a somewhat peculiar order shown in Fig. 8. Two iterations of the fermion\u2013fermion or pair\u2013pair four-point functions with O(zm) and O(zn) have the order of the product of theirs, i.e., O(zm+n). On the other hand, two iterations of the fermion\u2013pair four-point function have the order O(zm+n+1), which is one order greater than the order of their product. This additional order in fugacity can be understood from the increase or decrease of the number of propagators running backward in imaginary time due to iterations of the four-point functions."

This is understood from the fact that the energy of a bound molecule enhanced by the pair pinch singularity differs from its on-shell energy by the binding energy B . When the propagators on both sides of the fermion\u2013 pair four-point function have the pinch singularities simultaneously, this binding energy is propagated in the four-point function and is off-shell. The spectrum of the bare fermion propagator taken as the four-point function in \u03c3f-p does not have a width, so that off-shell energy cannot be propagated and thus, two pinch singularities do not occur simultaneously at O(z0). However, if one considers other diagrams for the fourpoint function such as the ones depicted in Fig. 9, the transport coefficient can have contributions with two pinch singularities occurring simultaneously, albeit at higher order.\nTherefore, an important lesson to be learned can be summarized as follows: The fermion\u2013pair fourpoint function at O(z0) does not allow the propagators on both sides of it to have the pinch singularities simultaneously. In other words, for two types of the pinch singularities to occur simultaneously, there must be a four-point function of at least O(z) inserted between them."

We evaluate the self-consistent equation with the above approximation so that it can be analytically continued into the equation for \u0393BRA-pair(p) needed to compute the transport coefficients according to Eq. (62). According to the above approximation, we write the self-consistent equation as\n\u0393B(i\u03c9Bm + i\u03c9 B , i\u03c9Bm;p) = m\n2 + 1\n\u03b2 \u2211 m\u2032 \u222b p\u2032 Kbox(i\u03c9 B m + i\u03c9 B , i\u03c9Bm;p|i\u03c9Bm\u2032 + i\u03c9B , i\u03c9Bm\u2032 ;p\u2032)\n\u00d7D(i\u03c9Bm\u2032 + i\u03c9B ,p\u2032)D(i\u03c9Bm\u2032 ,p\u2032)\u0393B(i\u03c9Bm\u2032 + i\u03c9B , i\u03c9Bm\u2032 ;p\u2032).

(69)\nHere, we have employed the approximation for the pair self-energy in which T3(\u2217) is truncated after the second term in the lower panel of Fig. 4; this approximation is consistent with replacing the four-point function Kp-p(\u2217) with Kbox(\u2217). This consistency can be understood from the fact that the box diagram of the second term in Fig. 5 is identical to the self-energy diagram with the approximated pair self-energy \u2206\u0303(i\u03c9Bm,p), shown in Fig. 11, except for the positions of the vertices.\n6 The imaginary part of the approximated pairing-shell pair self-energy is provided by\n\u2212 Im[\u2206\u0303R-pair(p)] = z \u2126d\u22121 m2a4\u2212d \u222b p\u2032 Kbox(p|p\u2032) + z \u2126d\u22121 m2a4\u2212d Vbox(p) +O(z 2), (70)\nwith\nVbox(p) \u2261 2 m2a4\u2212d\n\u2126d\u22121 \u222b p\u2032,k,k\u2032 e\u2212\u03b2 k (2\u03c0)d\u03b4d(p + k \u2212 p\u2032 \u2212 k\u2032) [2 p/2\u2212k\u2032 + B ]2 \u03b8(\u03b5)\u03c1D(\u03b5)|\u03b5= p/2+ k\u2212 p\u2032/2\u2212 k\u2032\u2212 B , (71)\nwhere \u03c1D(\u03b5) is the scattering continuum defined in Eq. (30) (See Appendix A for the detailed derivation). Here, Vbox(p) is the potential representing the scattering from incoming ( p/2 \u2212 B ,p; k,k) to outgoing ( p\u2032/2,p \u2032; k\u2032 ,k \u2032) energies and momenta. Therefore, we obtain the self-consistent equation for \u03d5pair(p) as\nm2 = \u222b p\u2032 Kbox(p|p\u2032)[\u03d5pair(p)\u2212 \u03d5pair(p\u2032)] + Vbox(p)\u03d5pair(p) +O(z). (72)\nOnce the solution of \u03d5pair(p) is determined, the bulk viscosity in Eq. (62) is provided by\n\u03b6 = z\u03b2\n(d\u2126d\u22121ad\u22122)2 \u222b p e\u2212\u03b2( p/2\u2212 B)\u03d5pair(p) +O(z 2). (73)\nIn the analogy to the derivation of the linearized Boltzmann equation, the self-consistent equation (72) can be considered to be the kinetic equation for the bound pairs. In contrast to the Boltzmann equation describing the collision process from two to two fermions, our kinetic equation, in particular the first term on the right-hand side, describes the change of state from one to one bound pair. This process can be understood from the corresponding Feynman diagram (the right panel of Fig. 11) as breaking and recombining a bound pair.\nWe comment on the bulk viscosity at positive scattering length. By solving the obtained kinetic Eq. (72) and computing Eq. (73), we can obtain the bulk viscosity at positive scattering length. However, we do not present the value of the bulk viscosity because Eq. (72) is more complicated than the linearized Boltzmann equation and even a good approximation method such as the relaxation time approximation is unclear. Note that although Eq. (73) is proportional to ze\u03b2 Ba4\u22122d, it is controlled in the applicable regimes of the quantum virial expansion shown in Fig. 1."

            "text": "In this paper, we exactly evaluated the Kubo formula [Eq. (11)] for the bulk viscosity in the hightemperature limit to leading order in fugacity. This task was achieved by summing up all contributions that\n6The pairing-shell pair self-energy from the first term of T3 has no imaginary part, so that it does not contribute to the self-consistent equation (69), see also Appendix A. For this reason, Fig. 11 shows the approximated pair self-energy, in which only the second term in the lower panel of Fig. 4 is taken as T3(\u2217).\nare of higher order in fugacity at nonzero frequencies but become comparable in the zero-frequency limit due to the pinch singularity, as in the calculations for the shear viscosity and the thermal conductivity [41]. The key difference between the bulk viscosity and the other transport coefficients is that the bulk viscosity is expressed in terms of a correlation function of two-body operators, i.e., the contact operators [Eq. (16)]. This difference not only makes the diagrams to be resummed more complicated than those for the other transport coefficients, but also brings about the emergence of the pair pinch singularity [Eq. (31)] in addition to the fermion pinch singularity [Eq. (26)] even at the lowest order in fugacity.\nFor negative scattering lengths, where the pair pinch singularity does not appear, we showed that the bulk viscosity is reduced to the sum of two contributions: the pair-bubble contribution [Eq. (44)] and the fermion kinetic contribution which is calculated from the linearized Boltzmann equation [Eqs. (45) and (47)]. Although both contribution were calculated separately in Refs. [25, 27, 28, 30\u201332], we showed that only their sum provides the complete bulk viscosity. We also obtained a new analytical expression for the bulk viscosity at arbitrary negative scattering length [Eqs. (53) and (57)] and plotted the whole bulk viscosity for negative scattering lengths in three dimensions in Fig. 2.\nFor positive scattering lengths, we showed that leading-order terms arise from contributions with the pair pinch singularity and need to be resummed. Then, under the approximation that the irreducible fourpoint vertex is given by the box diagram, we reduced the self-consistent equation for the vertex function to a linearized equation for the pair distribution \u03d5pair(p) [Eq. (72)]. The resulting linearized equation can be regarded as a kinetic equation for bound molecules in analogy to the linearized Boltzmann equation for fermions. Although the numerical solution of this kinetic equation requires further work, we identified the pair pinch singularity, which is responsible for the peaks pointed out in previous studies [28, 30\u201332], and provided a resummation method for it. We expect that this method will help to investigate the bulk viscosity in strongly correlated quantum many-body systems also beyond the high-temperature limit.\nFinally, we comment on the divergence of the bulk viscosity multiplied by the squared scattering length, a2\u03b6, in the unitary limit, as seen in the right panel of Fig. 2. This divergence originates from a singularity of the pair propagator in the unitary limit, which is different from the pair pinch singularity. We briefly provide an intuitive understanding of this divergence. The divergence of a2\u03b6 in the unitary limit arises from\nthe integral \u222b\u221e\n0 d\u03b5 [\u2212dfB(\u03b5)d\u03b5 ]DR(\u03b5,p)DA(\u03b5,p), which appears in the calculation of the contact correlation\nfunction divided by \u03c9 in the zero-frequency limit. Because of DR(\u03b5,p)DA(\u03b5,p) = (4\u03c0/m)2(m|\u03b5\u0303|)\u22121 with \u03b5\u0303 = \u03b5\u2212 p/2+2\u00b5 being the deviation from the on-shell energy, the integral diverges. However, the broadening of the fermion spectrum at O(z) leads in turn to a broadening \u03c7 \u223c O(z) of the pair propagator of the same order via the diagram in Fig. 3. Hence, the product of the retarded and advanced pair propagators is replaced as \u222b\nd\u03b5 [ \u2212dfB(\u03b5)\nd\u03b5\n] DR(\u03b5,p)DA(\u03b5,p) \u223c z2 \u222b \u221e 0 d\u03b5\u0303\u221a \u03b5\u03032 + \u03c72 \u223c z2 ln(1/z) (74)\nand the integral is regularized for any value of z. The logarithmic divergence of z2 ln(1/z) for z \u2192 0 exactly at unitarity is consistent with the divergence of a2\u03b6 as unitarity is approached in the right panel of Fig. 2. This singularity is interesting as a strong coupling effect because it is peculiar to the unitary limit, and we hope that a rigorous evaluation method for this singularity will be established in the future, as is the case for the pinch singularity."

Thus, one can evaluate the integration with the deformation of its contour into four straight lines along the branches as before.\nLet us first consider \u03c3f-p;pole, which is found as \u03c3f-p;pole = \u2212 \u222b p,q fF (\u2212 q\u2212p + \u00b5) \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e d\u03b5 2\u03c0 dfB(\u03b5) d\u03b5\n\u00d7 \u03b3F (\u03b5\u2212 q\u2212p + \u00b5+ i0+, \u03b5\u2212 q\u2212p + \u00b5\u2212 i0+;p)\u03b3B(\u03b5+ i0+, \u03b5\u2212 i0+; q) \u00d7 GR(\u03b5\u2212 q\u2212p + \u00b5,p)GA(\u03b5\u2212 q\u2212p + \u00b5,p)DR(\u03b5, q)DA(\u03b5, q) +O(z2),\n(B.5)\nwhere we supposed \u03b3F (\u2217) = \u03b3B(\u2217) = O(z0) in the order counting. In the omitted part as O(z2) of \u03c3f-p;pole, there is no product of the propagators which can lead to the pinch singularities, so that we do not discuss it.\nNext, we consider \u03c3f-p;lines, but it has no O(z) contribution even when the pinch singularities are taken into account. For this reason, we take only the contribution where both the product of the pair propagators and the product of the fermion ones can lead to the pinch singularities, as in Eq. (B.5). Such contribution is straightforwardly found as\n\u03c3f-p;lines ' \u222b p,q \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e d\u03b5 2\u03c0 fF (\u03b5\u2212 q\u2212p + \u00b5) dfB(\u03b5) d\u03b5\n\u00d7 \u03b3F (\u03b5\u2212 q\u2212p + \u00b5+ i0+, \u03b5\u2212 q\u2212p + \u00b5\u2212 i0+;p)\u03b3B(\u03b5+ i0+, \u03b5\u2212 i0+; q) \u00d7 GR(\u03b5\u2212 q\u2212p + \u00b5,p)GA(\u03b5\u2212 q\u2212p + \u00b5,p)DR(\u03b5, q)DA(\u03b5, q).\n(B.6)\nThe sum of Eqs.

(B.7) has no contribution with both the fermion and pair pinch singularities simultaneously, so that we consider the cases separately where there is the fermion or pair pinch singularity: \u03c3f-p = \u03c3f-p|fermi-pinch + \u03c3f-p|pair-pinch.\nFirst, when the product of the fermion propagators leads to the pinch singularity (26), it turns into \u03c3f-p|fermi-pinch = \u03b2 \u222b p,q e\u2212\u03b2( q\u2212p+ p) z2\u03b3FRA(p) \u22122Im[\u03a3R(p)]D R( q\u2212p + p \u2212 2\u00b5, q)\n\u00d7DA( q\u2212p + p \u2212 2\u00b5, q)\u03b3B( q\u2212p + p \u2212 2\u00b5+ i0+, q\u2212p + p \u2212 2\u00b5\u2212 i0+; q) +O(z2), (B.8)\nwhere we supposed \u03b3F (\u2217) = \u03b3B(\u2217) = O(z0) in the order counting. In this expression, the product of the pair propagators cannot have the pinch singularity because DR( q\u2212p + p\u22122\u00b5, q) does not have the binding peak at O(z0): Im[DR( q\u2212p + p \u2212 2\u00b5, q)] = \u2212\u03c1D(2 q/2\u2212p) +O(z). (B.9) The pair propagators in Eq. (B.8) are simply replaced with the bare ones and thus we get, with \u03b3FRA(p) denoting the on-shell vertex defined in analogy with Eq.

(B.10)\nSuch a contribution like Eq. (B.10), where the fermion pinch singularity is incorporated, has been considered in Section 3.\nNext, when the product of the pair propagators in Eq.

In \u03c3f-p with \u03b3 B(\u2217) = \u03b3F (\u2217) = O(z0), only Eqs. (B.10) and (B.14) give contributions at O(z). Therefore, we have shown that \u03c3f-p has no leading contribution with the fermion and pair pinch singularities occurring simultaneously."
