 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after reading the paper on high-throughput plant phenotyping using unmanned aerial systems:

1. Develop automated pipelines for processing and analyzing UAS-based crop imagery to make the technology more accessible to researchers without extensive technical expertise. The complexity of data processing and analysis currently limits broader use.

2. Evaluate the potential of UAS-based hyperspectral imaging to assess crop carotenoid content and relate to stress resilience and defense mechanisms. Carotenoids were not covered in the reviewed studies but could provide useful information.

3. Test UAS platforms and sensors for high-throughput phenotyping of horticultural crops like fruits and vegetables. Most studies focused on field crops, but HTPP could benefit breeding programs for other crops too.

4. Explore the use of multiple sensor fusion beyond dual combinations to optimize accuracy of crop trait extraction. Studies using RGB, multispectral, thermal, hyperspectral, and LiDAR together were limited.

5. Develop best practices for UAS-based HTPP tailored to specific crops, growing regions, and breeding objectives. The review highlighted variation in accuracy across crops, traits, and methods indicating need for crop/program specific guidelines.
