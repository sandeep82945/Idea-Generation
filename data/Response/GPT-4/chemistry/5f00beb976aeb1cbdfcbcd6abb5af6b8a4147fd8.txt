Optimization of Sophorolipid Production: Investigate alternative, cost-effective substrates and optimize fermentation conditions to further reduce the production costs of sophorolipids (SLs). This could involve screening for new microbial strains with higher SL yield or genetically modifying existing strains for enhanced production efficiency.

Mechanism of Cyanobacterial Degradation by SLs: Conduct detailed studies to understand the precise mechanisms through which lactonic and acidic sophorolipids induce the degradation of cyanobacteria. This would involve investigating the interactions at the molecular level, including the role of sophorolipids in disrupting cyanobacterial cell membranes and the specific pathways leading to cell death.

Environmental Impact and Ecosystem Safety of SL Application: Assess the long-term environmental impact and safety of using sophorolipids in aquatic ecosystems. This research could include studying the degradation products of SLs, their accumulation in the environment, and any potential effects on non-target organisms, including beneficial microorganisms and higher aquatic life forms.

Integrated Algal Bloom Management Strategies: Develop integrated management strategies that combine the use of sophorolipids with other biological, physical, or chemical methods for controlling harmful algal blooms. This could involve the design of multifaceted approaches that optimize the timing, dosage, and application methods for SLs in conjunction with other control measures to achieve more effective and sustainable management of cyanobacterial blooms.

Engineering SL-producing Microorganisms for In Situ Application: Explore the potential for engineering microorganisms capable of producing sophorolipids directly in aquatic environments prone to cyanobacterial blooms. This innovative approach would involve the development of safe, controlled-release systems or bioreactors that can be deployed in water bodies to produce and release SLs in response to the onset of algal blooms, offering a proactive and eco-friendly solution to this global challenge.
