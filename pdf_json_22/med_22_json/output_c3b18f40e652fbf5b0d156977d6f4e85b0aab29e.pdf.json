Almizraq1, Kayluz Frias Boligan1, Melika Loriamini1, Colin McKerlie2,3 and Donald R. Branch1,3,4*\n1Centre for Innovation, Canadian Blood Services, Toronto, ON, Canada, 2The Centre for Phenogenomics, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada, 3Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada, 4Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada\nBackground: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune/ inflammatory disease. The heterogeneity and complexity of clinical presentation has made it challenging to study or treat this syndrome. The (NZW\u00d7BXSB) F1 lupus-prone male mouse model of this disease is potentially useful to study mechanism and treatment modalities, but there is a lack of information about this model\u2019s characterization and disease progression. Therefore, the aim was to examine this lupus model\u2019s physical/clinical disease presentation and its immunological status.\nMaterials and methods: Clinical and physical status were observed in 8- and 16-week-old male and female (\u00b1 1 week) (NZW/LacJ x BXSB/MpJ) F1 mice (n = 8 per group). Young males (8 \u00b1 1 week) without disease and female (16 \u00b1 1 week) mice served as controls. Physical changes, quantitative values of autoantibodies, and blood cell parameters were determined.

The necropsy examination showed abdominal distension associated with serous effusion and histological examination identified severe edema and multi-organ abnormalities (spleen, lymph nodes, and kidney). Significant increases in anti-double-stranded DNA antibody (anti-dsDNA) was seen in old/sick compared to female (p = 0.0002) or young male (p = 0.0036) mice. Old mice developed immune thrombocytopenia compared to female (p = 0.0056) and young male (p = 0.0007) mice. Anti-platelet was detectable in old, sick mice. The mortality rate increased with aging; more than 35% of male mice died during this study between the ages of 13-18 weeks.\nConclusion: We found that the (NZW/LacJ x BXSB/MpJ) F1 male mice spontaneously exhibit, over varying lengths of time, extremely severe and\nfrontiersin.org01\nFrontiers in Immunology\nfatal clinical disease symptoms.

            "text": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), commonly referred to as lupus, is a multisystem chronic autoimmune/inflammatory disease. Lupus is characterized by the autoantibody production against self-antigens (e.g. double-stranded DNA and phospholipids), complement activation and immune complex deposition that result in tissue inflammation and multi-organ destruction (1). While the exact etiopathogenesis of SLE is still not entirely clear, it has been revealed that environmental exposures, cellular, hormonal and genetic factors contribute to the development of this disease (2, 3). The heterogeneity of this disease among patients and the complexity of clinical presentation have made it difficult to study or treat this syndrome potential treatment modalities fo (3, 4). Therefore, several animal models/strains, induced and spontaneous, have been made available to better understand and evaluate the various manifestations and potential this complex human disease (4, 5). While there are several differences among these animal models in terms of the autoimmune disease manifestations, such as the severity of the symptoms, sex differences, age of onset, survival rate, and the progress of autoimmunity (6), each animal model or strain can be an invaluable tool to better understand this disease and for defining pathogenic mechanisms.\nF1 hybrids of NZW and BXSB mice develop a spontaneous autoimmune syndrome and have been recognized as a model for autoimmune disease resembling that of human lupus patients. It has been indicated that the development of the autoimmune disease in these mice is severely accelerated in males due to the presence of the Yaa gene (Y chromosome-linked autoimmune acceleration/a mutant gene on the Y chromosome) and not due to hormonal factors (7\u20139). While it is known that the Yaa gene is the sex-specific factor that provokes the earlier onset, severity of the symptoms and acceleration of autoimmune disease in this mouse model, the mechanism of action remains unclear (9, 10). Even though the (NZW\u00d7BXSB)F1 lupus-prone male mouse model of lupus disease is potentially helpful for studying mechanism and treatment modalities, there is a lack of information about this model\u2019s characterization and disease progression. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the physical and clinical disease presentation correlating with the\n02\nseverity of lupus-like disease and the immunological status of (NZW x BXSB)F1 lupus mice."

Data showed that the body weight in old/sick lupus mice was significantly higher compared with controls (young males; p = 0.015 and females; p = 0.0001) by more than a 40% increase (Figure 2A and Supplementary Figure 1). Most of the time, the increase in the body weight was associated with an increase in the swelling, with a body condition scoring (BCS) of 4-5 in most of the sick cases (normal BCS range from 2.5-3). Additionally, moderate to severe abdominal distension/swelling was also observed in all lupus mice in the old male group (\u2265 16 weeks), which was statistically significant compared to control groups (young male mice; p = 0.0072 and female mice; p < 0.0001) (Figure 2B, Supplementary Figure 1). Moreover, monitoring the activity of this mouse model indicated that lupus male mice lose activity (lethargic mice) with aging. Moving disabilities such as inability to walk and difficulties in executing movements as a response to manipulation were associated with the severity of clinical symptoms, duration of illness and age of NZW x BXSB F1male lupus mice.With aging (\u2265 16 weeks), significant increases in movement disability were observed in NZW x BXSB F1 lupus male mice compared to female or young male lupus mice (p < 0.01; Figure 2C). While the paw pad color of mice in control groups is pink, old male lupus mice showed abnormal coloration, such as bright pale-white color of their paw pads (Supplementary Figure 1). A significant increase in the paleness of the paw pad color was observed withmost of the old (\u2265 16 weeks) male lupus mice (Figure 2D). Overall, as anticipated, the total clinical score was remarkably higher in old sick lupus male mice in comparison to female (p < 0.0001) or young male (p = 0.0074) mice (Figure 2E).\nData of blood cell parameters suggested that lupus male mice developed anemia and thrombocytopenia with aging\nComplete blood count provides information about health of cells/parameters, all of which were altered by lupus disease. Our findings showed that platelet, RBCs, and Hgb levels were significantly lower (p < 0.05) in old sick males compared to female and young male groups (Figure 3). These results suggest\nfrontiersin.org\nFrontiers in Immunology frontiersin.org06\nthat older male mice developed anemia and thrombocytopenia compared to female and young male mice. No significant differences were observed in the number of WBCs between the old sick lupus mice and the control groups (young male mice; p = 0.9653 and female mice; p > 0.9999, Figure 3E).\nDetection of autoantibodies in serum of NZW x BXSB F1 old lupus male mice\nA significant increase in the quantitative serum levels of dsDNA antibodies was detected in the sick/old lupus male mice compared to females or young males, consistent with the lupus phenotype in these mice (Figure 4). Even though values of the anti-nuclear antigens (ANA) antibodies and anti-Cardiolipin antibodies fell below the detection level of our standard curve (data not shown), the OD values showed that these antibodies were also elevated in the sick males compared to young males and females (Supplementary Figure 2). Altogether, these observations confirm the lupus-like phenotype present in this mouse model.\nHistopathological findings revealed multi-organ abnormalities in aged NZW x BXSB F1 lupus male mice\nHistological analysis was essential in our study to understand the impact of lupus on a variety of organs in this mouse model. The necropsy examination showed abdominal distension associated with serous effusion and histological examination identified multi-organ histopathology in old lupus male mice. These results were consistent with the physical/ clinical observations in this study. Although no significant histopathology was identified in all organs examined in female and young male mice (spleen, lymph nodes, liver, kidney, lung, heart), old lupus male mice showed abnormalities in multiple organs (Figure 5). The spleens had marked splenomegaly (long axis average length 3.8 \u00b1 0.5 cm) and histologically showed mild to moderate diffuse lymphoid proliferation (Figure 5A) compared to female and young male lupus mice (Figures 5B, C). Affected mice also had marked lymphadenopathy with axillary, mediastinal, lumbar, and popliteal lymph nodes enlarged up to 1cm in long axial length with diffuse cortical and medullary lymphoid hyperplasia (Figures 5D\u2013F). Old male mice also had histopathological changes consistent with SLE\u2019s autoimmune response including moderate chronic multi-focal to segmental glomerulointerstitial nephritis (Figures 5G\u2013I). Congo red staining of kidney for amyloid was negative in all sections examined (data not shown). Liver sections of old mice were characterized by moderate multifocal sinusoidal and periportal inflammatory cell infiltrates (Figures 5J\u2013L). The lungs from some old male mice were histologically\nFrontiers in Immunology 07\nunremarkable. However, in several old male lupus mice lung sections showed pulmonary interstitial hypertrophy, intraalveolar macrophages, and bronchiolar epithelial hyperplasia (Figure 5M) compared to the histologically unremarkable lung sections from female and young male lupus mice (Figures 5N, O). In the mice with lung changes, abnormalities in the heart were also identified including moderate single cell to multifocal necrosis with mild to moderate multifocal myocarditis dominated by mononuclear cell infiltrates and myocardial fibrosis (Figure 5P)."

            "text": "The relationship between the progression of lupus disease and the physical/clinical changes in the (NZW\u00d7BXSB) F1 lupus-prone male mouse model has not been thoroughly studied or even considered. Although no single animal model can wholly represent all clinical symptoms in human patients with lupus, each model shares a particular subset of characteristics that mimic human SLE, making them valuable (4, 12, 13). In our study, we provide evidence that the lupus-like syndrome developed in NZW/LacJ x BXSB/MpJ (F1 hybrids) was progressive and fatal, where nearly 100% of the male mice developed severe clinical symptoms. While lupus can be challenging to diagnose due to the complexity and the heterogeneity of clinical signs and symptoms, it was even more difficult in this study because of the sudden unexpected death exhibited in this model, where more than 35% of the lupus male mice died between the age of 13-18 weeks. These findings indicated that the (NZW\u00d7BXSB) F1 lupus-prone male mouse model investigated in this study was associated with a more rapidly progressive and severe disease than previously reported using the same strain (14). Although the primary cause of death is still unknown, its occurrence positively correlates with the severity of lupus flare in this model.\nThe body condition and general activity of NZW\u00d7BXSB F1 as measures of animal well-being exhibited the first noticeable manifestation of the disease in this model, characterized by significant abdominal distension/swelling in the male mice as they age. In some cases, abdominal distension can be recognized even before observing an increase in the weight measurements. Swelling caused by lupus has also been described and reported in humans (15\u201318). While swelling may occur in humans across the whole body, it is usually recognized in the joints, ankles, feet, legs, neck and face/eyelids. Noteworthy, in this study, severe swelling was observed around the neck and face area in some of the old mice group, but no paw swelling was detected in our cases, suggesting that this model may not develop arthritis. Swelling associated with lupus often can be a sign of a more severe complication, especially since lupus can cause inflammation and tissue damage to any organ system in the body due to abnormal immunological function. The swelling\nfrontiersin.org\nFrontiers in Immunology frontiersin.org08\nobserved in the old lupus male mice was consistent with our post-mortem necropsy findings, such as lymphadenopathy and kidney/renal impairment (lupus nephritis), resulting in diffuse edema and weight gain. It has been indicated that lupus nephritis\nFrontiers in Immunology 09\nis a common manifestation of SLE that can contribute to morbidity and mortality in SLE (19, 20). Symptoms may not be noticed in the early stages of lupus nephritis; however, as the inflammation continues to attack the kidneys, it prevents the\nfrontiersin.org\nFIGURE 5 Representative histological images of the NZW/LacJ x BXSB/MpJ 9 F1 lupus mice.

Lupus nephritis in our mouse model was also confirmed when urine collected from some of the old sick male mice with lupus showed a significant amount of protein leak in urine (2-3 plus; Urinalysis Test CHEMSTRIPS 9; Supplementary Figure 3).\nAs the disease gets worse in the old lupus male mice, it causes more substantial complications such as inability to walk and difficulties in executing movements, which were associated with the severity of other physical/clinical symptoms (e.g. rapid weight gain and swelling), age of male lupus mouse, and duration of illness. Additionally, we observed penile prolapse (40% of the old sick male mice) with inflammation (redness, swelling and bleeding sometimes; Supplementary Figure 1) in some cases. All the penile prolapse cases were associated with abdominal distension/swelling (moderate to severe), and most of these cases led to the inability to urinate or discharge normally and rarely survive after the diagnosis. Furthermore, the significant increase in the paleness of the paw pad with aging indicated poor blood circulation, which can be a sign of abnormal conditions such as hypoxia, anemia, or circulatory failure. This was reflected in the necropsy analysis (heart abnormalities in old lupus males) and the blood test which showed that the level of RBCs and hemoglobin were significantly lower in old lupus males compared to females and young males. Blood tests also revealed that the level of platelets was significantly lower in old males compared to females and young male mice, suggesting that these old sick male mice developed immune thrombocytopenia. We found anti-platelet and anti-RBC antibodies present in the sera from the old sick lupus mice (data not shown). The presence of anti-platelet antibodies was observed in 8 out of 12 (66.6%) sick mice, and 2 out of 10 (20%) sick mice showed anti-RBC antibodies in circulation. These results could partially explain the low RBC and platelet counts observed in circulation for the NZW x BXSB F1 old male lupus mice. While anti-RBC antibodies have never been investigated in this lupus mouse model, our findings of anti-platelet antibodies are in agreement with what was reported by Oyaizu et al. (21) in 1988, where (NZW/BXSB) F1 male mice were described as a new model for ITP. However, the ITP indications occurred slightly earlier in our study (within 4 months) compared to the reports by Oyaizu et al. (21)(> 5 months). It is worth noting that even though the 16-week-old female mice in this study showed no significant abnormalities, a previous study (14) showed that the NZW x BXSB F1 females develop SLE much slower than male mice. Whether the F1 female mice in our study may develop some of the SLE symptoms observed in our study or reach comparable levels as male mice later in age (e.g., 11 months of age or older) remains to be determined.\nF1 hybrids of NZW x BXSB male mice showed similar course of SLE disease as that occurs in male BXSB parents, but\nFrontiers in Immunology 11\nmore severe and progressive disease as they (F1 hybrids of NZW x BXSB male mice) fully express the Yaa gene of the BXSB strain (14, 22, 23). In our preliminary studies, the early disease onset (e.g., increased swelling, body weight, decreased activity, changes in blood cell parameters) is observed around 10 \u00b1 2 weeks of age. Much more severe symptoms were developed with aging, and the most significant differences in the physical characteristics and clinical manifestations were detected around 15-16 weeks of age. Therefore, and because of the higher mortality rate after 16 weeks of age with this model, our experiments for this study were performed within 16 weeks. The physical changes, clinical manifestations, and the multiple organ damage observed in this lupus-prone male mouse model are more likely associated with the detected autoantibodies (e.g. anti-dsDNA antibodies) in the serum. The significant role of autoantibodies in the pathogenesis of lupus has been reported (24, 25), especially the anti-dsDNA antibodies, which are highly specific for lupus. It has been shown that the levels of the anti-dsDNA antibodies tend to reflect disease activity; therefore, repeated serology testing of these antibodies is common practice as it can help assess the diagnosis of lupus, prognosis, staging, and disease activity (26\u2013 29), even though not in all patients. While these pathogenic autoantibodies have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of lupus and their capabilities in affecting multiorgans and causing tissue damage (24, 25, 29, 30), they are not sufficient to cause the disease. Thus, since the exact mechanism by which lupus disease is developed remains to be clarified, additional studies are warranted to understand the actual cause and the multifaceted mechanisms underlying this complex disorder."

            "text": "Our goal of this study was to fill the gap in the literature by providing physical/clinical characterizations to evaluate the progress of the lupus disease and highlight the main challenges associated with the (NZW/LacJ x BXSB/MpJ) F1 lupus-prone mouse model . This s tudy showed that NZW\u00d7BXSB F1 lupus-prone male mouse model is a complicated model that developed an early severe SLElike disease. The physical and clinical examinations provided in this study revealed that the old lupus male mice exhibited many complex features of SLE, including the presence ofautoantibodies (e.g. anti-dsDNA antibodies), glomerulonephritis, lymphadenopathy, spleen and heart abnormalit ies in addition to the severe abdominal distension/swelling, inability to walk, and significant weight increase. Examining this mouse model was challenging due to the extreme progression development of the disease and the sudden unexpected death exhibited. Therefore, we hope that\nfrontiersin.org\nthe characterizations and the knowledge provided in this study can be helpful to better evaluate and understand the progress of this disorder and may be used to assess the impact of different immunotherapies on ameliorating this complex disease."
