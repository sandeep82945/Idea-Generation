Expansion to Other Platinum Group Metals (PGMs): While this study focused on palladium (Pd), future research could explore the applicability of bioleaching using biogenic thiosulfate for other PGMs such as platinum (Pt), rhodium (Rh), ruthenium (Ru), iridium (Ir), and osmium (Os). Investigating the efficiency, selectivity, and optimal conditions for each of these metals could significantly contribute to sustainable recycling practices.

Scale-Up Studies and Process Optimization: Conduct scale-up studies to evaluate the feasibility of this bioleaching process at an industrial scale. This includes optimizing operational parameters, improving bioreactor designs for enhanced biogenic thiosulfate production, and developing continuous processing methods to increase the recovery rates and reduce the processing time.

Economic and Environmental Impact Analysis: Perform a comprehensive economic analysis to assess the cost-effectiveness of the bioleaching process compared to traditional recovery methods. Additionally, a life cycle assessment (LCA) could be conducted to understand the environmental impacts better and highlight the sustainability benefits of bioleaching with biogenic thiosulfate.

Development of a Recovery and Purification System for PGMs Post-Leaching: After bioleaching, the PGMs are in a leachate that contains other elements and compounds. Research could focus on developing efficient, environmentally friendly methods for separating and purifying PGMs from the leachate. This might involve exploring new precipitating agents, ion exchange resins, or membrane technologies specifically tailored for PGM recovery.

Investigation into Microbial Consortia and Genetic Engineering: Explore the use of diverse microbial consortia or genetically engineered microorganisms capable of producing higher thiosulfate concentrations or directly involved in the bioleaching process. This could improve the efficiency and selectivity of the bioleaching process. Understanding the microbial pathways and mechanisms involved in thiosulfate production and PGM bioleaching could open doors to bioengineering approaches for enhanced metal recovery.
