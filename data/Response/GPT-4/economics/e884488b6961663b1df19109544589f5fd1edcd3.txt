Adaptation and Mitigation Strategies for Crop Production under Climate Change: Investigate specific agricultural adaptation and mitigation strategies that could enhance wheat production under changing climate conditions. This could include studying the effectiveness of new crop varieties, advanced irrigation techniques, and soil management practices that increase resilience to climate variability.

Integrated Assessment of Climate Change on Multiple Crop Systems: While this study focused on wheat, future research could take an integrated approach to assess the impact of climate change on multiple crop systems simultaneously. This would help understand the interdependencies and competition among different crops for resources, and how changes in one crop system might affect others, considering both food security and ecosystem sustainability.

Socio-economic Impacts of Changes in Crop Production: Further research could delve into the socio-economic impacts of changes in wheat production due to climate and population changes. This includes examining the effects on food prices, farmer incomes, and employment in agricultural sectors. Special attention could be given to vulnerable populations and regions to identify policies that could mitigate negative impacts.

Long-term Impacts of Population Dynamics on Food Security: Explore in-depth the long-term implications of population growth, urbanization, and dietary shifts on food demand and supply. This research could utilize advanced modeling techniques to project future scenarios and assess the capacity of agricultural systems to meet changing food needs, considering not only quantity but also nutritional quality.

Technology and Innovation in Sustainable Agriculture under Climate Stress: Investigate the role of technological advancements and innovation in promoting sustainable agriculture under climate stress. This could include precision agriculture, genetic modification for climate resilience, and the use of artificial intelligence and big data in crop management. The research could evaluate the potential benefits, risks, and barriers to adoption of these technologies in different agricultural contexts.
