 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct longitudinal studies following cohorts of patients to better establish causality between temperature changes and AMR rates. The ecological study design of this paper limits the ability to infer causality. 

2. Examine the relationships between temperature and AMR in different geographic regions beyond Europe to see if associations hold. Expanding to other parts of the world could provide more robust evidence.

3. Investigate the impact of seasonal temperature changes on AMR rates. The current study only looked at annual temperature changes, but seasonal fluctuations may also be relevant. 

4. Analyze temperature associations with AMR rates for a broader range of pathogens and antibiotic classes. The paper focused on a limited selection, but expanding the scope could reveal new insights.

5. Incorporate high-resolution temperature data to assess relationships at a more localized level. The country-level data used may mask important geographic variations within countries. More granular temperature data could help clarify the associations.
