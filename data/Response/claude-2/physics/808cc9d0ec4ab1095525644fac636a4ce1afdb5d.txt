 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate the optimization of biogenic thiosulfate production at larger scales. The current study was conducted in a 3L bioreactor, so scaling up the process in larger bioreactors could help determine if similar thiosulfate yields are achievable. This could enhance the viability for industrial applications.

2. Explore the recovery of other PGMs like platinum and rhodium using biogenic thiosulfate leaching. The current study focused only on palladium recovery, but expanding it to other catalytic metals could demonstrate the versatility of this method.

3. Conduct an in-depth characterization of the microbial community dynamics during thiosulfate production. The roles and interactions of microbes involved could provide insights to further optimize the process. Metagenomic analysis could reveal key species. 

4. Evaluate the efficiency of biogenic thiosulfate leaching using real automotive catalyst waste as the metal source. The current study used a synthetic catalyst, so testing real waste samples would better replicate industrial conditions.

5. Perform a detailed economic analysis and life cycle assessment comparing biogenic thiosulfate leaching to conventional methods. This could quantify the potential costs savings and environmental benefits of this approach to further assess its industrial viability.
