    "abstractText": "Individuals are increasingly exposed to news and opinion from beyond national borders in a world that is becoming more and more globalised. This news and opinion is often concentrated in clusters of ideological homophily such as political parties, factions or interest groups. But how does exposure to cross-border information affect the diffusion of ideas across national and ideological borders? Here we develop a non-linear mathematical model for the cross-border spread of two ideologies by using an epidemiological approach. The populations of each country are assumed to be a constant and homogeneously mixed. We solve the system of differential equations numerically and show how small changes in the influence of a minority ideology can trigger shifts in the global political equilibrium.",

In contrast, the model we describe here idealises ideologies as fixed and as competing with each other for supporters both within and across borders. We also assume constant and homogeneous mixed populations with no spatial or social structure. Agents in our model can only support one ideology (party or political tendency) at any given moment in time.\nLet us consider two countries whose respective homogeneously distributed populations are N1 and N2. The population of country 1 N1 consists of three sets of agents, namely: (i) without ideological or political affiliation V1, (ii) with ideology or political affiliation B, (iii) with ideology or political affiliation C. Similarily, the population of country 2 N2 consists of three sets of agents, namely (i) without ideological or political affiliation V2, (ii) with ideology or political affiliation D, (iii) with ideology or political affiliation E. Now, assume that B and D have the same ideology, and that C and E also share the same ideology. These two groups form two blocks of competing ideologies (e.g pro and anti-tax, pro and anti-vaccination, pro and anti-immigration, etc...).\nIn our model of cross-border influence we will allow that each of the blocks is able to recruit supporters (voters) both within and outside its borders, so that for example, B will be able to recruit supporters from V1 and C within its borders, but will also be able to exert influence outside its borders by recruiting agents from V2 and E towards D. Similarly, C, D, E will be able to recruit supporters for themselves and for their ideological partners beyond their borders.\nOn the other hand, consider there are rates \u00b52 and \u00b54 at which agents \u00b52V1 and \u00b54V2 cease to be potential voters of countries 1 and 2 respectively due to deth or migration. Similarly, we have death ratios \u00b5B, \u00b5C, \u00b5D and \u00b5E for each of the political groups, all labelled with their respective sub-indexes. A system with no gains or losses of citizens over time will keep \u00b5 constant and of equal value across all population groups.\nNow, consider that there is a rate \u00b51 at which agents \u00b51N enter the system in country 1, and similarly a rate \u00b52 at which agents \u00b52N enter the system in country 2. This parameter can be thought of as the rate at which individuals reach the legal age or at which they attain the necessary civic knowledge, skills, cognitive ability and right to vote.\nParameter k1 stands for the average number of contacts of agents of B with agents of V1 and p1 is the probability of B convincing another agent per contact. This means that the term k1 p1V1 BN1 stands for the rate of agents that move from V1 to B, where BN1 is the chance of coming into contact with the members of B in country 1 (i.e. the relative weight of B in the population). Similarly, the term k2 p2V1 CN1 is the rate of agents that move from V1 to C, the term k3 p3V2 DN2 is the rate of agents that move from V2 to D and k4 p4V2 E N2 is the rate of agents\n2010 Mathematics Subject Classification. 37B55, 34A34.

Also, agents of V1 may decide to join B, not because of B \u2019s direct influence, but as a consequence of a foreign influence of the same nature as B, in our case D. The transfer of agents from V1 to B due to the influence of D occurs at rate (1\u2212 k1 p1)k3 p3V1 DN2 . Likewise, E can capture agents from V1 to C at rate (1\u2212 k2 p2)k4 p4V1 EN2 . In country 2, we have the same mechanism reversed for D and E.\nBut ideological or political affiliation can fade over time. In the model this loss can be described by a leakage of agents from the B category back to V1 at rate \u03b31B, and from C to V1 at rate \u03b32C. In country 2, we have the same, there is a leakage of agents from D to V2 at rate \u03b33D and from E to V2 at rate \u03b34E.\nFinally, let \u03c61 and \u03c62 be the per capita recruitment capacity of B from C and of C from B respectively. Similarily, \u03c63 and \u03c64 are the per capita recruitment capacity of D from E and of E from D respectively. Therefore, agents of C decide to go to B due to B\u2019s influence at rate \u03c61C BN1 and due to D\u2019s influence at rate (1\u2212\u03c61)\u03c63C DN2 , while agents of B decide to go to C due to C\u2019s influence at rate \u03c62B C N1\nand due to E\u2019s influence at rate (1\u2212\u03c62)\u03c64B EN2 . Likewise, in country 2 agents of E move to D due to D\u2019s influence at rate \u03c63E D N2\nand due to B\u2019s influence at rate (1\u2212\u03c63)\u03c61E BN1 , while agents of D decide to go to E due to E\u2019s influence at rate \u03c64D E N2 and due to C\u2019s influence at rate (1\u2212\u03c64)\u03c62D CN1 .\nIn accordance with the parameters, terms and assumptions described above, the governing differential equations of the model can be written as follows 1:\n dV1 dt = \u00b51N1\u2212 k1 p1V1 B N1 \u2212 (1\u2212 k1 p1)k3 p3V1 DN2 \u2212 k2 p2V1 C N1 \u2212 (1\u2212 k2 p2)k4 p4V1 EN2 \u2212\u00b52V1 + \u03b31B+ \u03b32C dB dt = k1 p1V1 B N1 +(1\u2212 k1 p1)k3 p3V1 DN2 \u2212\u03c62B C N1 \u2212 (1\u2212\u03c62)\u03c64B EN2 +\u03c61C B N1 +(1\u2212\u03c61)\u03c63C DN2 \u2212\u00b5BB\u2212 \u03b31B dC dt = k2 p2V1 C N1 +(1\u2212 k2 p2)k4 p4V1 EN2 \u2212\u03c61C B N1 \u2212 (1\u2212\u03c61)\u03c63C DN2 +\u03c62B C N1 +(1\u2212\u03c62)\u03c64B EN2 \u2212\u00b5CC\u2212 \u03b32C dV2 dt = \u00b53N2\u2212 k3 p3V2 D N2 \u2212 (1\u2212 k3 p3)k1 p1V2 BN1 \u2212 k4 p4V2 E N2 \u2212 (1\u2212 k4 p4)k2 p2V2 CN1 \u2212\u00b54V2 + \u03b33D+ \u03b34E dD dt = k3 p3V2 D N2 +(1\u2212 k3 p3)k1 p1V2 BN1 \u2212\u03c64D E N2 \u2212 (1\u2212\u03c64)\u03c62D CN1 +\u03c63E D N2\n+(1\u2212\u03c63)\u03c61E BN1 \u2212\u00b5DD\u2212 \u03b33D dE dt = k4 p4V2 E N2 +(1\u2212 k4 p4)k2 p2V2 CN1 \u2212\u03c63E D N2 \u2212 (1\u2212\u03c63)\u03c61E BN1 +\u03c64D E N2\n+(1\u2212\u03c64)\u03c62D CN1 \u2212\u00b5EE\u2212 \u03b34E (1)\nwhere N1 =V1 +B+C being V1(0)> 0,B(0)\u2265 0,C(0)\u2265 0 and N2 =V2 +D+E being V2(0)> 0,D(0)\u2265 0,E(0)\u2265 0. Adding the equations we see that dN1/dt = 0 and dN2/dt = 0.\nGiven that k1 stands for the average number of contacts of members of B with members of V1 per unit time, and that p1 is the probability of B convincing another agent per contact, then we have that the per capita recruitment rate of B from V1 is \u03b21 = p1k1. The same applies to the rest of the equations, where: \u03b22 = p2k2, \u03b23 = p3k3, \u03b24 = p4k4.Therefore, the model can be reduced to the following system:\n dV1 dt = \u00b51N1\u2212\u03b21V1 B N1 \u2212 (1\u2212\u03b21)\u03b23V1 DN2 \u2212\u03b22V1 C N1 \u2212 (1\u2212\u03b22)\u03b24V1 EN2 \u2212\u00b52V1 + \u03b31B+ \u03b32C dB dt = \u03b21V1 B N1 +(1\u2212\u03b21)\u03b23V1 DN2 \u2212\u03c62B C N1 \u2212 (1\u2212\u03c62)\u03c64B EN2 +\u03c61C B N1 +(1\u2212\u03c61)\u03c63C DN2 \u2212\u00b5BB\u2212 \u03b31B dC dt = \u03b22V1 C N1 +(1\u2212\u03b22)\u03b24V1 EN2 \u2212\u03c61C B N1 \u2212 (1\u2212\u03c61)\u03c63C DN2 +\u03c62B C N1 +(1\u2212\u03c62)\u03c64B EN2 \u2212\u00b5CC\u2212 \u03b32C dV2 dt = \u00b53N2\u2212\u03b23V2 D N2 \u2212 (1\u2212\u03b23)\u03b21V2 BN1 \u2212\u03b24V2 E N2 \u2212 (1\u2212\u03b24)\u03b22V2 CN1 \u2212\u00b54V2 + \u03b33D+ \u03b34E dD dt = \u03b23V2 D N2 +(1\u2212\u03b23)\u03b21V2 BN1 \u2212\u03c64D E N2 \u2212 (1\u2212\u03c64)\u03c62D CN1 +\u03c63E D N2\n+(1\u2212\u03c63)\u03c61E BN1 \u2212\u00b5DD\u2212 \u03b33D dE dt = \u03b24V2 E N2 +(1\u2212\u03b24)\u03b22V2 CN1 \u2212\u03c63E D N2 \u2212 (1\u2212\u03c63)\u03c61E BN1 +\u03c64D E N2 +(1\u2212\u03c64)\u03c62D CN1 \u2212\u00b5EE\u2212 \u03b34E\n(2)\nNow, because the transfer of agents between B and C due to their influence within the country results in a net amount of exchange, it follows that \u03c62\u2212 \u03c61 = \u03c6w1. The same for D and E, where we have: \u03c64\u2212 \u03c63 = \u03c6w2. Following the same reasoning, we also observe that there is a net transfer of agents due to cross-border influence, therefore (1\u2212\u03c62)\u03c64\u2212 (1\u2212\u03c61)\u03c63 = \u03c6b1 and (1\u2212\u03c64)\u03c62\u2212 (1\u2212\u03c63)\u03c61 = \u03c6b2. After this reduction, our system can be written as follows:\n1N1,V1,B,C,N2,V2,D,E are all dependent on time. For brevity of notation, the time dependencies of N1(t),V1(t),B(t),C(t),N2(t),V2(t),D(t),E(t) are not made explicit in the equations throughout the paper.\nMODELLING THE DYNAMICS OF CROSS-BORDER IDEOLOGICAL COMPETITION 3\n dV1 dt = \u00b51N1\u2212\u03b21V1 B N1 \u2212 (1\u2212\u03b21)\u03b23V1 DN2 \u2212\u03b22V1 C N1 \u2212 (1\u2212\u03b22)\u03b24V1 EN2 \u2212\u00b52V1 + \u03b31B+ \u03b32C dB dt = \u03b21V1 B N1 +(1\u2212\u03b21)\u03b23V1 DN2 \u2212\u03c6w1B C N1 \u2212\u03c6b1B EN2 \u2212\u00b5BB\u2212 \u03b31B dC dt = \u03b22V1 C N1 +(1\u2212\u03b22)\u03b24V1 EN2 +\u03c6w1B C N1 +\u03c6b1B EN2 \u2212\u00b5CC\u2212 \u03b32C dV2 dt = \u00b53N2\u2212\u03b23V2 D N2 \u2212 (1\u2212\u03b23)\u03b21V2 BN1 \u2212\u03b24V2 E N2 \u2212 (1\u2212\u03b24)\u03b22V2 CN1 \u2212\u00b54V2 + \u03b33D+ \u03b34E dD dt = \u03b23V2 D N2 +(1\u2212\u03b23)\u03b21V2 BN1 \u2212\u03c6w2D E N2 \u2212\u03c6b2D CN1 \u2212\u00b5DD\u2212 \u03b33D\ndE dt = \u03b24V2 E N2 +(1\u2212\u03b24)\u03b22V2 CN1 +\u03c6w2D E N2 +\u03c6b2D CN1 \u2212\u00b5EE\u2212 \u03b34E\n(3)\nAnd so after division we obtain the following differential equations:\n dv1 dt = \u00b51\u2212\u03b21v1b\u2212 (1\u2212\u03b21)\u03b23v1d\u2212\u03b22v1c\u2212 (1\u2212\u03b22)\u03b24v1e\u2212\u00b52v1 + \u03b31b+ \u03b32c db dt = \u03b21v1b+(1\u2212\u03b21)\u03b23v1d\u2212\u03c6w1bc\u2212\u03c6b1be\u2212\u00b5Bb\u2212 \u03b31b dc dt = \u03b22v1c+(1\u2212\u03b22)\u03b24v1e+\u03c6w1bc+\u03c6b1be\u2212\u00b5Cc\u2212 \u03b32c\ndv2 dt = \u00b53\u2212\u03b23v2d\u2212 (1\u2212\u03b23)\u03b21v2b\u2212\u03b24v2e\u2212 (1\u2212\u03b24)\u03b22v2c\u2212\u00b54v2 + \u03b33d + \u03b34e dd dt = \u03b23v2d +(1\u2212\u03b23)\u03b21v2b\u2212\u03c6w2de\u2212\u03c6b2dc\u2212\u00b5Dd\u2212 \u03b33d de dt = \u03b24v2e+(1\u2212\u03b24)\u03b22v2c+\u03c6w2de+\u03c6b2dc\u2212\u00b5Ee\u2212 \u03b34e\n(4)\nNow, let us denote the equilibrium of the above system as (v\u22171, b \u2217, c\u2217, v\u22172, d \u2217, e\u2217) and therefore v\u22171 = V \u2217 1 /N1, b \u2217\n= B\u2217/N1, c\u2217 = C\u2217/N1, v\u22172=V \u2217 2 /N2, d \u2217=D\u2217/N2, e\u2217=E\u2217/N2, where (V \u22171 , B \u2217, C\u2217, V \u22172 , D \u2217, E\u2217) represents the equilibrium of the unreduced system. Since the population of agents in each country remains constant as given by N1 = V1 +B+C and N2 = V2 +D+E, we deduce v1 +b+ c = 1 and v2 +d + e = 1 for the reduced system. Using this fact, the reduced model system will be given by the following four differential equations:\n db dt = \u03b21(1\u2212b\u2212 c)b+(1\u2212\u03b21)\u03b23(1\u2212b\u2212 c)d\u2212\u03c6w1bc\u2212\u03c6b1be\u2212\u00b5Bb\u2212 \u03b31b dc dt = \u03b22(1\u2212b\u2212 c)c+(1\u2212\u03b22)\u03b24(1\u2212b\u2212 c)e+\u03c6w1bc+\u03c6b1be\u2212\u00b5Cc\u2212 \u03b32c dd dt = \u03b23(1\u2212d\u2212 e)d +(1\u2212\u03b23)\u03b21(1\u2212d\u2212 e)b\u2212\u03c6w2de\u2212\u03c6b2dc\u2212\u00b5Dd\u2212 \u03b33d de dt = \u03b24(1\u2212d\u2212 e)e+(1\u2212\u03b24)\u03b22(1\u2212d\u2212 e)c+\u03c6w2de+\u03c6b2dc\u2212\u00b5Ee\u2212 \u03b34e\n(5)\nWe conducted numerical simulations assuming constant \u00b5 = 0.017 and constant \u03b3=0.01. We assume that the average individual acquires the right to vote at the age of 18 and spends about 60 years of his or her life with an active political life, i.e. \u00b5=1/60. We systematically manipulated parameters k (average number of contacts per time per capita of a given party), parameters p (capacity to convince of a given party) and \u03c6 (per capita recruitment of a given party). Following the logic of previous models, we keep recruitment capacity parameters \u03b2 and \u03c6 at realistically low values (0 to 0.1). For example, 1/25 = 0.04 means that 25 members of a political party are able to recruit 1 voter in a year.\nOur simulations show various equilibria, some with co-dominance of ideologies (Fig. 1 I & II), and others with dominance of one ideology (Fig. 1 III & IV). Interestingly, in some areas of the parameter space, a small change in the recruiting capacity of one of the parties can produce a total reversal of the balance of power. This butterfly effect is illustrated by the comparison of scenarios V and VI in Fig. 1, which makes it clear that the system suffers from deterministic chaos. An increase as small as 0.005 in the initial recruitment capacity of the minority party D from E in country N2 triggers a global ideological shift, revealing a high sensitivity of the system to initial conditions. According to our model, these seemingly imperceptible shifts in influence around the tipping point can consummate short-term political changes (within a few decades) and extinctions of once-dominant ideologies within a few hundred years.\nOur model simulates a closed system with two hypothetical countries where political parties can exert influence within and across borders. In the real world this idealised situation does not exist. However, our model can inform how ideologies compete across national boundaries in an increasingly globalised world. For example, pro- and anti-democratic attitudes or pro- and anti-authoritarian views seem to behave as competing ideological blocks beyond national borders [8]. And today, more than ever before, the internet and social media have intensified this cross-border competition of ideologies on a global level.\nOne take-home message that emerges from our model is that small changes in the influence of an ideology, a party or a minority opinion can trigger substantial political change in the medium to long term.
