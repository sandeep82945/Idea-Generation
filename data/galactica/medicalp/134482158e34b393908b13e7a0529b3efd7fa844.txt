conclusion We have demonstrated the existence of nonlinear three-wave resonant interactions occurring between two different branches of the hydrodynamic wave dispersion relation, namely the gravity-capillary and sloshing modes. To the best of our knowledge, this three-wave two-branch interaction mechanism has never been reported experimentally in any wave system. The system used is a torus of fluid for which the sloshing mode can easily be excited. When subjected to a weak monochromatic forcing, a triadic resonance instability is first observed with an exponential growth of the daughter waves and a phase locking of the three waves. The efficiency of this interaction is found to be maximum when the gravity-capillary phase velocity matches the group velocity of the sloshing mode. The interaction between waves belonging to these two branches can be considered as an analog of a forced harmonic oscillator. For stronger forcing, additional waves are generated by a cascade of three-wave interactions populating the high-
frequency part of the wave spectrum. Since this mechanism authorizes three-wave interactions in a 1D system far from the gravity-capillary transition, it thus paves the way to reach a wave turbulence regime triggered by this atypical mechanism.
