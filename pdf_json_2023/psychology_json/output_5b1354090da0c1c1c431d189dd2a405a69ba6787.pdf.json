    "abstractText": "The rapid and accurate detection of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels is of great significance for the diagnosis and later treatment evaluation of liver cancer. In this study, a novel integrated quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) immunosensor based on the design to contact liquids on one side only was developed for the label-free detection of AFP. Anti-AFP mouse monoclonal antibodies were immobilized onto the upper electrode surface of the pre-treatment crystals using the staphylococcus aureus protein A. The AFP antigens in human serum were captured by specific surface-coated antibodies, and testing was carried out by monitoring the corresponding changes in frequency. The concentration range of the antigen detected was 13\u2013760 ng/mL. The frequency characteristics of the process of antibody immobilization were investigated in detail, and high reproducibility of AFP antibody immobilization was achieved (standard deviation (SD) = 2.2 Hz). The developed QCM measurement system demonstrated a short test time (only 30 min), good reproducibility (the biological activity can still maintain more than 90% of the first test till it is reused five times), and accuracy as good as the one achieved with the radioimmunoassay (the maximum relative deviation = 4.8%). The designed QCM test system can easily and quickly detect AFP concentrations up to 760 ng/mL, indicating that the developed QCM assay is likely to lead to an alternative approach in large-scale screening for liver cancer in the near future.",

            "text": "Liver cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers in the world [1]. Its mortality rate makes it the second-most deadly cancer in the world, following lung cancer. The core reason for this is the low rate of early diagnosis; nearly 80% of the patients have entered the middle and late stages once found, losing the chance of radical surgical resection. The detection of tumor markers in serum is one of the methods for early diagnosis [2]. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), the most specific marker for liver cancer, is traditionally detected by many analytical techniques, including radioimmunoassay (RIA), chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay (TRFIA), etc. [3\u20137]. Nevertheless, many disadvantages are involved in these techniques, such as the need for a label, radioactive contamination, their time-consuming nature, severe temperature interferences, and the need for expensive instrumentation. Therefore, developing a label-free, safe, rapid, steady, and economical approach to detecting AFP concentrations in serum for large-scale screening of liver cancer is of great importance. The quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) is a label-free, acoustic bio-sensing system that has become a powerful bioanalytical tool in recent years. To date, QCMs have been\nDiagnostics 2023, 13, 1630. https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics13091630 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/diagnostics\nDiagnostics 2023, 13, 1630 2 of 11\nwidely used in biological and biomedical research [8\u201314]. As a shear-mode device, QCM consists of a thin AT-cut quartz disk sandwiched between two gold electrodes. In QCM immunosensors, the biologically active component, such as an antibody, is immobilized onto the surface of the electrode. When the antigen is recognized by the immobilized antibody, through the mass-loading effect of QCM, the specific recognition is transformed into a frequency change that can be measured by a universal frequency counter. Finally, an obvious dose\u2013response correlation can be established between the variations of the analyte concentration and frequency shifts. In the 1950s, Gunter Sauerbrey pointed out the linear relationship between the change in mass and the corresponding resonance frequency shift of the QCM as follows [15]:\n\u2206 f = \u2212 2n f0 2\nA(C66\u03c1q) 1 2\n\u2206m (1)\nwhere \u2206m is the change in the mass deposited on the surface of QCM (in g), \u2206 f is the monitored frequency change, which is caused by the changed mass on the electrode surface (in Hz), f0 is the resonant frequency of the first mode (in Hz), n is the overtone mode, A is the active vibrating area (in cm2), and C66 = 2.947\u00d7 1011 g \u00b7 cm\u22121 \u00b7 s\u22122 and \u03c1q = 2.648 g \u00b7 cm\u22123 are the shear modulus and density of quartz, respectively. The negative sign shown in the equation reflects that the frequency of QCM decreases as the deposited mass on the electrode surface increases. In this work, the QCM immunosensor\u2019s experimental techniques for AFP detection from serum were investigated. We developed a novel QCM measurement system, which consisted of a design to contact serum on one side of the crystal, a homemade Pierce\u2013 Gate crystal oscillator with a harmonic suppression circuit (inductance and capacitance combination) to drive the QCM at its third harmonic frequency, and a universal frequency counter for frequency data monitoring. As schematically illustrated in Figure 1, the QCM\u2019s crystal surface was coated with an anti-AFP mouse monoclonal antibody. To expand the potential sites for binding to AFP antigens, AFP antibodies were immobilized using the protein A immobilization technique, and protein A was bound to the Fc segment of the antibody. When the coated anti-AFP bound with AFP in human serum, the changed frequency induced by the change in mass of the anti-AFP/AFP immunocomplex was monitoring within a certain antigen concentration range. Particular attention was given to the detection time and frequency characteristics for the process of antibody immobilization. More details of the analytical performances of the developed QCM sensor were investigated, including the selectivity, linear range, reproducibility, and reusability.

            "text": "In QCM immunosensors, high mass sensitivity is desirable. If the resonator works in its fundamental frequency, it is necessary to increase the frequency of the resonator and thus reduce the thickness of the crystal to obtain high-quality sensitivity. However, the mechanical strength deteriorates as the thickness decreases, resulting in a crystal easily ceasing its oscillation [16,17]. Since overtone resonators have better frequency stability than fundamental resonators at the same resonant frequency, all quartz crystals (10 MHz, optically polished surface, 8 mm in crystal diameter, and 5 mm in gold electrodes diameter) employed in this study were third overtone AT-cut with 6135 \u2032\u00b0 angle in order to guarantee high mass sensitivity and good frequency stability. These crystals were obtained from Wintron Inc. (Zhengzhou, China) and were driven by a homemade oscillator circuit. The quartz crystal, the heart of the QCM, was designed to make contact with serum at one side only. This design intended to eliminate the influences of liquid damping and non-uniform coating to allow the crystal reach a stable oscillation condition and ensure the repeatability of detection. Agilent universal frequency counter 53220A, with a resolution of 12 s/bit was used to measure the resonant frequency. The measurement system was shown in Figure 2.

If the resonator works in its fundamental frequency, it is necessary to increase the frequency of the resonator and thus reduce the thickness of the crystal to obtain high-quality sensitivity. However, the mechanical strength deteriorates as the thickness decreases, resulting in a crystal easily ceasing its oscillation [16,17]. Since overtone resonators have better frequency stability than fundamental resonators at the same resonant frequency, all quartz crystals (10 MHz, optically polished surface, 8 mm in crystal diameter, and 5 mm in gold electrodes diameter) employed in this study were third overtone AT-cut with 35\u25e616\u2032 angle in order to guarantee high mass sensitivity and good frequency stability. These crystals were obtained from Wintron Inc. (Zhengzhou, China) and were driven by a homemade oscillator circuit. The quartz crystal, the heart of the QCM, was designed to make contact with serum at one side only. This design intended to eliminate the influences of liquid damping and non-uniform coating to allow the crystal reach a stable oscillation condition and ensure the repeatability of detection. Agilent universal frequency counter 53220A, with a resolution of 12 s/bit was used to measure the resonant frequency. The measurement system was shown in Figure 2.
