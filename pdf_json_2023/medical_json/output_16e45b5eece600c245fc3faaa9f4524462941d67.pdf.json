    "abstractText": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an enveloped respiratory \u03b2 coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19), leading to a deadly pandemic that has claimed millions of lives worldwide. Like other coronaviruses, the SARS-CoV-2 genome also codes for non-structural proteins (NSPs). These NSPs are found within open reading frame 1a (ORF1a) and open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) of the SARS-CoV-2 genome and encode NSP1 to NSP11 and NSP12 to NSP16, respectively. This study aimed to collect the available literature regarding NSP inhibitors. In addition, we searched the natural product database looking for similar structures. The results showed that similar structures could be tested as potential inhibitors of the NSPs.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an enveloped respiratory \u03b2 coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19), leading to a deadly pandemic that has claimed millions of lives worldwide [1]. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is an approximately 29.9 kbp long positive-sense singlestranded RNA molecule with a 5\u2032-cap and 3\u2032-poly-A tail that encodes structural proteins, non-structural proteins (NSP), and accessory proteins [2,3]. The spherical SARS-CoV-2 is decorated by the Spike (S) protein, a critical protein that facilitates the entry of the virus into the host cell [4]. The spike protein must bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and undergoes cleavage by the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) [2]. Upon successfully entering a susceptible host cell expressing the ACE2 receptor and TMPRSS2, the virus can begin translating its genome almost immediately without any additional modifications due to its mature positive-sense RNA genome [2]. Consistent with other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 has structural proteins, including the S protein, the membrane protein (M), the envelope protein (E), and the nucleocapsid protein (N) [2]. As mentioned above, the viral S protein binds to the ACE2 receptor on the surface of host epithelial cells to gain access to the cytoplasm [5]. The M protein is involved in viral morphogenesis and budding. In addition, it stabilizes the interaction between the nucleocapsid and RNA for proper virion assembly [5]. Lastly, the E protein serves primarily as an additional barrier but can also act as a viroporin ion channel to release virions from the virally infected cell into the surrounding environment [2,5]. Within the SARS-CoV-2 virion, N proteins form a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex with the viral genome to package the RNA into a helical ribonucleoprotein structure [2,5]. Like other coronaviruses, the SARS-CoV-2 genome also codes for non-structural proteins (NSPs) [2]. These NSPs are found within open reading frame 1a (ORF1a) and\nInt. J. Mol.

The open reading frame of the viral genome can be translated independently in the case of ORF1a to produce the polyprotein 1a (pp1a, NSP1 to NSP11), or it can include both open reading frames in succession to produce polyprotein 1ab (pp1ab, NSP12 to NSP16) by the host ribosome (Figure 1) [2,3]. Something unique about the SARS-CoV-2 genome is that the reading frame for NSP12 to NSP16 differs from NSP1 to NSP11. To adjust for this difference, the virus uses part of NSP11 (13 bp), which belongs to ORF1a, to shift the reading frame. As such, part of the NSP12 sequence overlaps with the NSP11 sequence, resulting in the final protein being called pp1ab despite the protein sequence being composed of ~99% pp1b and ~1% pp1a.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 29\nLike other coronaviruses, the SARS-CoV-2 genome also codes for non-structural pro-\nteins (NSPs) [2].

Created with BioRender.com and adapted from [6].\nFollowing the translation of pp1a and pp1ab, these polyproteins are cleaved by two\ndifferent virally encoded proteases, the papain-like protease (PLpro), also known as NSP3\nand the 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) otherwise known as NSP5, to produce the\n16 NSPs that play different roles in propagating the virus [2]. These roles include viral\nreplication, genomic processing, and disruption of cellular processes to evade the host\u2019s\ninnate immune system.\nTo efficiently propagate the virus within the host cell, certain NSPs, such as NSP7,\nNSP8, and NSP12, can work in unison to form a replication transcription complex (RTC)\nthat can create copies of the viral genome using the positive sense RNA template packaged\nin the virion [5]. This complex is further supported by other proteins, including a primer\nfor RNA synthesis (NSP9), a helicase to unwind the RNA (NSP13), and an exonuclease to\ncorrect mismatched bases (NSP14) [5,7\u201310].\nTo ensure that viral replication proceeds uninterrupted, NSP6 can form a heterodi-\nmer with NSP3 (NSP3-NSP6) or NSP4 (NSP4-NSP6) to compartmentalize this process by\nforming double-membrane vesicles (DMV) and autophagosomes [11,12].

Once the RNA products are synthesized, they undergo a series of post-transcriptional modifications mediated by the viral proteins NSP10, NSP12, NSP13, NSP14, and NSP16, adding a 5\u2032 mRNA cap to mimic host mRNAs. At the same time, the genome itself encodes the poly-A tail [13\u201315].\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 13002 3 of 28\nAlthough viral replication is necessary for viral propagation, there also needs to be other factors encoded in the viral genome that can protect viral replication by interfering with the innate immune system. One common strategy the virus employs is dampening the innate immune response. It can achieve this by interrupting autophagy and interferon pathways to disrupt the synthesis of intracellular mediators [5,16\u201320]. The virus can also impact host replication by blocking ribosome entry sites, cleaving host mRNAs, and preventing cargo transport into and out of the nucleus [21,22]. Altogether, these virulence factors encoded by NSPs play a major role in disrupting host replication while promoting the synthesis and assembly of new viral products. They are also essential for disrupting the innate immune response to prevent the host from mounting an attack against the virus, which can limit the infection. As such, identifying how these NSPs work to repurpose drugs to target viral replication and the viral inhibition of the innate immune system to allow the host to mount a more robust immune response is paramount. Similarly, it is also important to develop a multi-drug regimen that can achieve the above purpose while limiting the probability of inadvertently promoting the selection of drug-resistant strains of the virus through selective pressures. This study aimed to collect the available literature regarding NSP inhibitors. In addition, we searched the natural product database looking for similar structures. The results showed that similar structures could be tested as potential inhibitors of the NSPs."

Genomic sequence analyses of SARS-CoV-2 have shown that less than 3% of NSP1 sequences displayed a mutation, indicating that it is a highly conserved protein with remarkable conservation within the C-terminal domain [21]. This highly conserved region of NSP1 usually plays a role in suppressing the host immune response. It has also been shown that patients infected with variants of SARS-CoV-2 that had deletions in the helix\u2013loop\u2013helix region of the C-terminal domain of NSP1 had lower viral loads, corresponding to less clinically severe outcomes [38]. Some drugs that can target the C-terminal domain include montelukast sodium hydrate and mitoxantrone dihydrochloride. The N-terminal domain can also be targeted indirectly. For example, the N-terminal domain of NSP1 normally interacts with the stemloop 1 (SL1) binding region on the 5\u2032 UTR of the mRNA transcript to increase its translation rate [39]. Thus, by targeting this highly conserved region in the 5\u2032 UTR, the binding of the NSP1 to the SL1 region can be prevented to decrease the viral translation of its mRNA. Some drugs have been shown to bind to the SL1 region, including glycyrrhizic acid (1), lobaric acid (2), garcinolic acid (3), and tirilazad (4). Montelukast (5) is a leukotriene receptor antagonist shown to lower cytokine release and lung inflammation, reducing clinical deterioration in patients admitted with COVID-19 [63]. This reduction in infection severity may be due to montelukast binding to the C-terminal end of NSP1 to alleviate the inhibition of host protein synthesis, resulting in an increased immune response that lowers viral replication, as seen in the decreased expression of viral spike protein in virally infected HEK293T-ACE2 and Vero E6 cells [5,21].\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 13002 7 of 28\nAs an FDA-approved drug for treating asthma, montelukast could be a candidate for drug repurposing to treat COVID-19. Mitoxantrone dihydrochloride (MTX) (6) is a surface heparan sulfate inhibitor and anticancer drug with a high affinity for the C-terminal region of NSP1 [5,41,67]. MTX can also block viral entry into cells by binding to heparan sulfate and preventing the viral S protein from using it as a binding mediator [41,67]. Glycyrrhizic acid, lobaric acid, garcinolic acid, and tirilazad are a panel of inhibitors that show high affinity for the NSP1-SL1 binding region, which impedes its ability to interact with the 5\u2032 UTR leader sequence on the viral mRNA [58,68]. This interaction between the SL1 region and the 5\u2032 UTR is necessary and sufficient to allow the viral mRNA to avoid the virally induced translational inhibition exhibited by NSP1 and enhance its translation [39,69]. Thus, targeting this domain would make the viral mRNA a susceptible target for inhibition by its viral mechanism [39]. Although the main function of NSP1 is to impede host translation via its C-terminus, the NSP1-SL1 binding region has been shown to possibly play a role in translational regulation as well, which would make this panel of drugs or other antisense oligos that bind the 5\u2032 UTR directly a viable target for future inhibitors [68,70]."

Drugs such as the competitive inhibitor VIR251, previously used to treat SARSCoV-1, have been repurposed due to the structural similarity in enzymatic sites between these two viruses [70]. The binding of VIR251 to the S4 binding pocket of PLpro prevents the cleavage of pp1a and the release of certain NSPs. On the other hand, allosteric inhibitors such as GRL0617 target specific naphthalene binding sites on PLpro that can prevent the entry of ISG15, an innate immune system regulator, from being cleaved and neutralized by PLpro [14,18,19]. This stops the protease from disrupting the innate immune response and allows the host to better clear the virus. VIR251 (7) is a covalent inhibitor that targets the active PLpro (NSP3) site by binding to catalytic cysteine residues [70]. Due to SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 sharing a nearly identical binding pocket, this drug has been a primary candidate for drug repurposing to treat COVID-19 [71]. It occupies the S4 pocket of PLpro and forms an irreversible covalent thioether linkage with cysteine-111 [71,72]. The binding of VIR251 has been shown to inhibit PLpro completely from interacting with molecular probes, indicating that this drug could potentially block the protease from cleaving pp1a [71]. GRL-0617 is a naphthalene-based molecule that binds non-covalently to Tyr-268 on an adjacent naphthalene inhibitor binding site of PLpro to block entry of ISG15 into the active site [14,18,19]. It also increases the phosphorylation of IFN pathway intermediates such as IRF3, TBK1 and p65 in the NF-kB pathway [2,5,14,19].

Thus, by restoring the autophagic flux, which is the rate of autophagic degradation in the cell, the hope is to limit the formation of DMVs and thus reduce viral replication in the infected cell. Metformin (12) is a biguanide compound that inhibits complex I of the electron transport chain to suppress ATP synthesis and activate AMP kinase (AMPK) through its phosphorylation [17]. The phosphorylation of AMPK has been shown to lower the total amount of viral mRNA, viral protein, and virions in Calu-3 and Caco-2 cells [17]. This may be due to AMPK activating autophagic pathways that decrease cell and tissue damage to lower inflammation [17,20]. This regulation could also restore autophagic flux to prevent the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes that produce pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1b and IL-18, which induce cell death [49]. However, the exact mechanism by which metformin limits viral replication is unknown. Other similar compounds to metformin, such as the active form of vitamin D (1-a,25dihydroxy vitamin D3) (13) and phytochemicals like polydatin (14), have also been shown to modulate NSP6 activity by controlling autophagic flux as well as limiting pyroptosis and ROS production [5,49]."

For SARSCoV-2, NSP14 is the protein that regulates this process while also serving a secondary role in mRNA capping. This enzyme has three domains that can be targets of drugs: the active site, the Zn binding sites, and the N7 methyltransferase domain. Ritonavir (19) is a protease inhibitor that binds to the exoribonuclease active site of NSP14 to prevent the 3\u2032 end of the substrate RNA from complexing with NSP14 [5,80]. This abolishes the proofreading capabilities of NSP14 by preventing the cleavage of mismatched bases from the viral genome, leading to lethal mutagenesis and the cessation of genomic replication [5,80]. Disulfiram (20) and ebselen (21) are zinc-ejector drugs that bind to the conserved zinc motifs on NSP14 to displace the zinc ions [61,70]. This would prevent the exoribonuclease from excising mismatched bases and increase the efficacy of nucleotide drugs that incorporate into the viral RNA genome to inhibit viral replication, such as remdesivir [61]. Sinefungin (22) is a pan-methyltransferase inhibitor and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) analog that competitively inhibits the N7 methyltransferase domain of NSP14 by binding to a pocket between the SAM and RNA cap binding sites [5,13,70]. This prevents the SAM cofactor from donating a methyl group to NSP14 to methylate the RNA cap [4]. The interruption of RNA capping reduces translation efficiency. It increases the probability that the innate immune system responds to the uncapped mRNA in the cytoplasm, which can help trigger an immune response to eliminate the virus [13]."

As a result, viruses have evolved to prevent the degradation of their viral mRNA in the cytoplasm by encoding repeating adenine residues at the 3\u2032 end of each NSP. However, since nucleic acids are complementary, the complementary RNA strand used to replicate the viral genome contains repeating uracil residues. Since the host cell has evolved mechanisms that can detect uridine repeats, the virus has co-evolved a mechanism that can cleave these uridine repeats to lower the risk of detection by host PRRs. As NSP15 is responsible for removing uridine repeats to avoid detection by the innate immune system, drugs have been repurposed to target the active site of NSP15 to prevent the enzyme from binding to the polyuridine repeats and cleaving the viral mRNA transcripts. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) (23) is a natural compound derived from green tea extracts that competitively inhibits NSP15 by binding to the active site and preventing the cleavage of uridylates from the growing RNA strand [62]. EGCG has been shown to completely inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 with a concentration as low as 1 \u00b5g/mL [62].

            "text": "Remdesivir (25) is a phosphoramidate prodrug metabolized within the body to produce an active nucleoside analog that causes replication to cease when added to a growing RNA strand by RdRP (NSP12) [82]. After remdesivir is incorporated into the growing RNA strand, the RdRP can add three more nucleotides before forming a translocation barrier. This translocation barrier locks the 3\u2032 nucleotide within the substrate binding site of the polymerase and prevents new nucleotides from being added [82]. This inhibition may be due to the steric clash between the C1\u2032-cyano group in remdesivir and the serine-861 side chain of NSP12, which impacts the positioning of the RNA within the enzyme and prevents the further addition of nucleotides [83]."

Nirmatrelvir functions as a competitive peptidomimetic inhibitor of the 3CLpro or main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (NSP5) by forming a reversible covalent bond with the cysteine-145 residue in the active site of the protease [85]. The role of ritonavir is to target and irreversibly block the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A family responsible for oxidizing nirmatrelvir [85,86]. This will increase the bioavailability and decrease the dosage of nirmatrelvir required for treatment while reducing the potential side effects associated with its use [85,86]. Together these two drugs can inhibit the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 and prevent the cleavage of pp1ab into its NSP byproducts."

            "text": "Molnupiravir (26) is an isopropyl ester prodrug similar to remdesivir in that they both must be metabolized into an active nucleoside analog [87,88]. The metabolized form of molnupiravir is NHC, and this metabolite can enter cells and be phosphorylated to produce an active ribonucleoside triphosphate (NHC-TP) that can induce RNA mutagenesis [87,88]. When NHC-TP is added to the growing negative-sense RNA strand in place of cytidine triphosphate or uridine triphosphate by RdRp, it generates an error in the viral genome [87,89]. This error, however, does not trigger the termination of RNA synthesis due to the stable bond formed between NHC-TP and its respective base pair, allowing replication to continue uninterrupted [87,89,90]. Though when the negative-sense RNA\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 13002 11 of 28\ntemplate containing NHC-TP is used to create a new positive-sense RNA template, the nucleotide that is paired with NHC-TP can be either an adenosine triphosphate or a guanosine triphosphate, resulting in mutagenesis if the incorrect base was added. This positive-sense RNA template containing numerous mutations will then be unable to produce functional viral proteins, limiting the viral propagation in the host [88,90]."

Blocking IL-6Rs prevents IL-6 from exerting its proinflammatory effects on the immune system, which leads to the activation of the adaptive immune system. Since IL-6 levels are upregulated in patients with COVID-19 and elevated levels of this cytokine are linked to greater mortality, administering these MAbs that can antagonize the IL-6R may aid in modulating the cytokine storms and help the body better clear the infection [92]."

Since JAKs are key signal transducers in the JAK-STAT pathway, which controls the transcription of multiple cytokines, inhibiting JAKs is key to lowering cytokine production [94,95]. This leads to a reduction in many inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-10, IL-8, and CXCL3, contributing to the cytokine storms seen in severe cases of COVID-19."

For the analysis of similar structures, the similarity coefficient of Tanimoto (\u22650.9) was selected. From all the possible structures, the most similar carbon skeleton was chosen. The natural compounds found (Table 2) could represent alternative compounds that can increase the natural product arsenal against SARS-CoV-2. Although not all the natural compounds shown in Table 2 have been tested as potential antivirals, some showed similar activities to the original compounds reported in other viral models. The natural source of the alternative inhibitors is detailed in Table 3. For example, psoromic acid (29) is a \u03b2-orcinol depsidone that has been reported to inhibit Herpes Simplex virus type 1 and type 2 [96]. This report highlighted that the mechanism of inhibition is related to the viral DNA polymerase. When psoromic acid was combined with the antiviral acyclovir, superior antiviral activity was measured. Acyclovir also targets viral DNA replication by binding its converted form acyclo-GTP to the DNA polymerase [97].\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 13002 12 of 28\nTable 2.

It is also known as calcitroic acid and is produced upon hydroxylation of calcitriol by the CYP24A1 24-hydroxylase. This modification turns calcitriol into a more soluble molecule, facilitating its excretion in the bile and urine [98]. Although calcitroic acid has not been tested as an antiviral, its intermediate, calcitriol, has been reported to induce autophagy in human macrophages through a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-, ATG-5-, and Beclin-1-dependent mechanism that significantly inhibits the human immunodeficiency virus 1 replication in a dose-dependent manner [99]. The tannin chebulagic acid (39) has been reported as a broad-spectrum antiviral because it has been used to target different viral models [100]. Reports showed its ability to target human cytomegalovirus, hepatitis C virus, dengue virus, measles virus, and respiratory syncytial virus in a dose-dependent manner [99]. In addition, it can inhibit the replication of human enterovirus 71 [101], influenza A virus [102], and SARS-CoV-2 [103]. Several mechanisms of action have been proposed related to chebulagic acid\u2019s activity. For example, an allosteric inhibition of the viral 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro) [103], the inhibition of the channel influenza A virus [102] and neuraminidase-mediated viral release [104], and the inhibition of viral attachment in the human cytomegalovirus, hepatitis C virus, dengue virus, measles virus, and respiratory syncytial virus have been used as viral models [100]. On the other hand, the tannin punicalin (40) was shown to inhibit the replication of the episomal stage of the hepatitis B virus, limiting the formation of the pregenomic RNA in the infected cells [105]. Moreover, inhibition of the human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase was reported, which also limits the replication of the virus in lymphocyte cells [106]."

            "text": "Currently, the therapeutics recommended by the WHO for the treatment of COVID-19 are based on the severity of the disease. While this approach is effective for treating patients in the present, using mono-drug treatments can have long-lasting impacts on the evolution of viruses due to mutations in the viral genome driven by selection pressures. Using single therapeutics to treat any viral infection poses the risk of inadvertently selecting drug-resistant variants, which can render our currently available therapeutics ineffective. As such, it is important to identify possible therapeutics that can effectively neutralize and stop the viral life cycle at multiple different points to reduce the likelihood of selecting these drug-resistant variants. It is also essential to examine how multiple drugs can be used synergistically. This will increase the treatment\u2019s efficacy while minimizing the risk of\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 13002 23 of 28\nresistance, which is essential for reducing this virus to treatable endemic levels, like the common flu. When selecting a drug for treatment, the first factor is identifying how well the target site is conserved between different virus variants. Regions of the viral genome that are generally well conserved are those involved in replication, as mutations in these areas directly affect the ability of the virus to generate more copies of itself. These include the two main virally encoded proteases, the RTC and the proofreading exoribonuclease, which are prime targets as the viability of the virus would also be compromised if it acquired mutations in these regions to combat our therapeutics. Thus, by targeting these conserved sites, we can prevent the processing of the polyprotein into its functional subunits and impair viral replication by reducing the reliability of viral replication. When selecting candidates for combinatorial drug treatments, it is also important to consider how well the drugs work in tandem and whether there are any reductions in efficacy when they are co-administered. This can be achieved through in silico screenings that can model whether there are any adverse interactions between the drugs and viable candidates and can then be later validated through in vitro and in vivo experiments. Considering the above factors, a drug cocktail to inhibit viral protein synthesis could consist of VIR251, Paxlovid, and tirilazad. In this formulation, VIR251 would inhibit PLpro to block the cleavage of pp1a, while Paxlovid would inhibit 3CLpro to stop pp1ab from being cleaved into the NSPs, limiting viral protein activity. If both protease inhibitors fail to prevent the cleavage of the polyproteins, tirilazad could act upstream on NSP1 to inhibit the synthesis of viral mRNAs to prevent the synthesis of more viral polyproteins. Another proposed multi-drug regimen focused more on inhibiting viral replication could include sofalcone, disulfiram, and remdesivir. Sofalcone and disulfiram are both inhibitors of the viral proofreading mechanism that target the enzyme at different target sites. Since these drugs lower the fidelity of replication, they synergize effectively with remdesivir by preventing the removal of the nucleotide analog from the growing RNA strand. This, in turn, would increase the likelihood of chain termination occurring. Although these multi-drug regimens may be an effective form of treatment, some limitations may prevent their implementation in practice. Issues concerning the tolerance of taking multiple drugs simultaneously can be a limiting factor. Also, accounting for changes in bioavailability and determining the effective and inhibitory dosages may be challenging with the increased number of factors at play. Thus, it may be more feasible to approach treatment with single drugs; acknowledging the benefits and drawbacks of using multi-drug treatments is important to consider for improving treatments in the future. Moreover, some similar structures found in the database (28\u201345) have shown antiviral activities in other viral models. In this regard, validation is required to address their inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV-2.\nAuthor Contributions: H.B. conceptualized, reviewed, edited the manuscript, and acquired financing.
