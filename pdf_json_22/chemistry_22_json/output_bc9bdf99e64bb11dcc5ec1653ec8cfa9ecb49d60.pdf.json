            "text": "Lactoferrin (LF) is an essential biofunctional iron-binding protein of the innate immune system with a molecular weight of approximately 80 kDa. It affects host defense and tumor growth inhibition and has antibacterial, antiviral, and antiparasitic activities (1, 2). Recently, LF has been applied in dairy products and commercial foods for non-breastfed infants as a functional component, promoting optimal growth (3, 4). In 2012, the GB14880-2012 \u201cFood Nutrition Fortification Use Standard\u201d issued by the National Health and Wellness Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China listed LF as a nutritional fortification and set the maximum use of LF at 100 mg/100 \u00d7 g for infant foods. To date, different analytical techniques have been established (5). Although chromatographic methods, such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (6, 7), high-performance capillary electrophoresis (HPCE) (8), and high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) (9), have good reproducibility and high accuracy, they would require complex pretreatment processes and professional personnel to operate. In recent years, antibody-based biosensors, such as electrochemical sensors (10), surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (11), and enzymelinked immunosorbent assays (12), have gradually been used to detect LF. However, the antibody is generally more expensive, complicated to prepare with animal immunization experiments, and requires strict conditions to ensure its stability. Hence, simple and convenient methods are of great significance for sensitive LF detection.\nNucleic acid aptamers are single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or RNA sequences generated from a random oligonucleotide library through the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) (13, 14). They exhibit many advantages, such as small size, simple synthesis, good stability, and non-immunogenic nature, as viable alternatives to antibodies (15). Numerous aptasensors (16) have been recently established. Among them, fluorescence-based aptasensors are the most common type, featuring simplicity, fast response, high sensitivity, and universal applicability (17, 18). However, most of them require labeling aptamers or modifying bases with fluorescent groups, which are time-consuming and\nexpensive, and the affinity of the aptamer to the target and the detection sensitivity are affected (19). Therefore, label-free fluorescent aptasensors have attracted much interest due to their flexible design and versatility.\nAs an essential type of single-stranded oligonucleotide, aptamers display three prominent characteristics for developing label-free fluorescent sensors (20, 21). (i) The aptamer exhibits multiple negatively charged phosphate functional groups, which result in the aggregation of positively charged small molecule probes and enable efficient probe fluorescence quenching, such as perylene (22), pyrene (23), silole (24), and tetraphenylethene (25) derivatives. (ii) Some special folded spatial conformations of aptamers, such as protoporphyrin (26), malachite green, thioflavin T (27), N-methyl mesoporphyrin IX (28), and DFHBI (29), could enable the intercalation of dyes to produce strong fluorescence (30). (iii) The aptamer can be easily hybridized with its complementary chain, forming a double helix conformation of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) through hydrogen bonding from base pairing (31). Thus, some minor groove binding dyes could specifically intercalate into dsDNA, inducing exponential fluorescence enhancement and enabling sensitive detection of PicoGreen (PG) (32), SYBR Green I (SGI) (33), and AccuBlue (34). There are inherent base-complementary pairings in the self-assembly structure of the aptamers\u2019 flexible folding. Therefore, the minor groove-binding dyes could also intercalate into the aptamer structure to fabricate various aptasensors.\nHerein, a self-assembly and universal fluorescence aptasensor was designed for the sensitive detection of LF in milk powder based on the specific embedding dye PicoGreen (PG), of which there are few pieces of literature introducing PGbased self-assembly aptasensors. PG is a highly ultrasensitive fluorescent dye that does not fluoresce when it is free. Upon binding to dsDNA and inducing a >1,000-fold fluorescence enhancement (35), dsDNA detection concentrations as low as 25 pg\u00b7mL\u22121 were enabled. The aptamer against LF was screened using capillary electrophoresis (CE)-SELEX by our group in 2020 with good affinity (KD, 20.74 nM) and specificity (36). Without LF, the aptamers formed a specific spatial structure by self-assembly folding. The dyes recognized the minor groove structures and intercalated into them, generating a noteworthy augmentation of the fluorescence signal. In the presence of LF,\nFrontiers in Nutrition 02 frontiersin.org\nthe aptamer binds to it preferentially, and its space structure is unfolded. This caused the freeing of the subsequent dye and decreased the corresponding fluorescence. In addition, the universality was also confirmed against the other four targets or utilizing another dye. This label-free strategy achieved universal and sensitive detection only by \u201cmix-and-detect\u201d procedures, contenting the need to design simple and feasible aptasensors."

            "text": "As depicted in Figure 1A, the sensing system for LF detection consisted of three parts: aptamers, PG dyes, and LF targets. Without LF, the aptamers formed a specific spatial structure by self-assembly folding due to the combined and additive effect of complementary base pairings and intermolecular weak non-covalent interactions (e.g., electrostatic and \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions, hydrophobic effects, hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces). At this stage, the PG dyes recognized the minor groove structures, intercalated into them, and stimulated their potential fluorescent properties, initiating a strong fluorescence. LF targets induced configuration changes in aptamers owing to their high-affinity bonding, concurrently forcing the amount of the inserted dyes to decrease and causing a significant reduction in the fluorescence signal. Hence, the LF target concentrations could be directly determined through the reflected fluorescence signals.\nFigure 1B shows the feasibility of the sensing system (fluorescence spectra in Supplementary Figure 1A). The mixture of PG and aptamer generated a distinct fluorescence enhancement. In contrast, no single component produced substantially no fluorescence, which indicated that PG had availably intercalated into the partial spatial structures of the aptamer. Adding LF (100 nM, 1 \u00b5M) decreased the fluorescence, suggesting that the aptamer was more inclined to bind with its target LF, thus retaining more free PG dye. This phenomenon can also be explained by our previous molecular docking model (36) of aptamer/LF recognition that involved the 18 amino acids of LF and 17 key bases of aptamer, whose interaction would unfold the spatial structure of the aptamer and free the dyes. The result preliminarily proves that the experimental principle is feasible."

Supplementary Figure 1B shows the effect of different concentrations of PG on the fluorescence signal. The maximum fluorescence intensity value was obtained when the PG concentration was increased to 5 \u00d7 , indicating that at this concentration, PG can completely intercalate into the minor groove of the aptamer. Nevertheless, the fluorescence values tended to decrease when the concentration was more than 5 \u00d7 because an excessively high PG concentration would cause a spatial site resistance effect and thus affect the fluorescence intensity. Therefore, 5 \u00d7 PG was used for further experiments. In addition, the reaction time of PG also plays a vital role in the sensing process. Supplementary Figure 1C shows that the fluorescence intensity maintained a plateau within 5\u201330 min of incubation time.\nFIGURE 1 (A) The principle of the label-free aptasensor strategy for LF detection.

The proposed aptasensor presented an available performance only through a simple \u201cmix-and-detect\u201d procedure.\nTo investigate the specificity of the sensing strategy, four types of high-abundance proteins commonly found in milk at high concentrations were tested, including serum albumin (SA), casein (CS), \u03b2-lactoglobulin (\u03b2-Lg), and \u03b1-lactalbumin (\u03b1-La). Figure 2B shows only LF, and mixture 2 (containing LF, CS, \u03b1-La, \u03b2-Lg, and SA) presented a noticeable reduction in fluorescence intensities in the sensing system. In contrast, the other proteins and mixture 1 (containing CS, \u03b1-La, \u03b2Lg, and SA) led to almost no decrease even though their concentrations were 4-fold excess (2 \u00b5M) than the target LF. The results illustrated that the introduced self-assembled aptasensor presented good specificity for LF detection. However, mixture 2 of the control proteins (each at 2 \u00b5M) and LF (0.5 \u00b5M) still exhibited a slight influence on the fluorescence\nFrontiers in Nutrition 05 frontiersin.org"

The coefficient of variation (CV) can relatively reflect the dispersion of experimental data and is also commonly used to evaluate the repeatability and stability of experiments (37). Higher CV values\nindicate higher detection errors, while lower values indicate more stable results. The calculated CV of the interday assay was 4.75%, wherein the low value demonstrated the good stability of the aptasensor.\nLactoferrin determination in milk powder\nThe experiments were carried out in a milk powder matrix to assess the operability and usefulness of the introduced aptasensor in actual samples. One commercially available milk powder labeled with no LF was chosen as a blank sample, which was validated by a high-performance capillary electrophoresis (HPCE) assay (Supplementary Figure 2 an insert picture). After simple dissolution and centrifugation, the sample matrix was spiked with standard LF in the concentration range of 0\u20131,000 nM. Figure 2D shows that\nFrontiers in Nutrition 06 frontiersin.org\nthe fluorescence signal gradually decreased with increasing LF concentration. A good linear relationship was obtained over the range of 20\u2013500 nM for the value of (F0-F)/F0 and the concentration of LF, and the LOD was calculated to be 3 nM (2.4 mg/kg). The detection limit meets China\u2019s GB14880-2012, which shall not exceed 1.0 g/kg. Such high sensitivity could predict the potential LF content in milk powders. Although the slope presented a difference from that in the standard solution, the detection results of LF in matrixes could be quantitatively deduced by the calibration curve in the standard solution multiplied by an adjustment factor. In addition, the coefficient of determination (R2) in matrixes was greater than 0.98, showing good linearity in the analytical range. The\nresults showed that the system fluorescence signal responded well to the LF concentration in the milk powder matrix. Furthermore, the aptasensor showed a good average recovery of 95.8\u2013105.1%, with a relative standard deviation (RSD) of less than 4% in the milk powder sample (Table 1), which indicated that this developed aptasensor works well in practical applications."

As shown in Figures 3A\u2013D, the quenching efficiency (F0\u2013F)/F0 values of all targets have good linear relationships with the target concentrations as well as good correlation coefficients (R2> 0.95). The results confirmed that the proposed strategy is likely to be a sensitive and universal aptasensor.\nFurthermore, the flexibility of the fluorescent aptasensor was also verified utilizing another fluorescent dye, SYBR Green I (SGI) (Figures 4A\u2013F), with similar characteristics to PG, enabling dsDNA detection concentrations as low as 20 pg/mL (38). In the range of 20\u2013500 nM, good linear relationships were obtained in the standard solution (R2, 0.990) and the milk powder matrix (R2, 0.986) with LODs of 5.4 and 5.9 nM, respectively. Meanwhile, the aptasensor exhibited good selective specificity and spiked recovery (106.2\u2013108.5%, Supplementary Table 2), indicating that the strategy is feasible in practical applications.\nFurthermore, we applied this strategy to determine the LF content in three milk powders, which were also quantified using the HPCE method (8) (Supplementary Figure 2). The content of LF in milk powders detected by the two methods is listed in Supplementary Table 3, and the results show that the HPCE method is roughly consistent with our aptasensor. However, the aptasensor took only 20 min to complete a quick analysis in all samples, which was much shorter than that required by the commercial CE of approximately 120 min for all samples.\nComparison with other methods\nThe performance comparison of this aptasensor with other LF methods is shown in Table 2. Radial immunodiffusion is one of the simplest methods; however, it has poor sensitivity. HPCE, HPLC, and SPR techniques have shown good performance, but they are expensive and require professional technicians. Microfluidic paper and ELISA have high accuracy, but both are based on the immunoreaction between LF and its antibody, which are expensive reagents and complicated to prepare. Among the detection methods, the present work reported a very low LOD of 0.16 \u00b5g/mL (2 nM). Although Huang et al. (10) reported a higher sensitivity with a lower LOD, electrochemical sensors still rely heavily on expensive electrochemical systems with high resolution, and cyclic voltammetry requires 20 scans to obtain reliable results. The self-assembled fluorescent aptasensor presented a low dependence on instruments and an available performance with a simple \u201cmix-and-detect\u201d procedure, high sensitivity and time savings compared with other reported methods for LF detection."

The direct-recognition aptasensor avoids the synthesis, consumption and complex optimization of the complimentary chains generally required in dsDNAbased aptasensors and gains a better performance (LOD, 2 nM vs. 205 nM, Supplementary Figure 3) by a facile \u201cmix-and-detect\u201d operation. Furthermore, this strategy has been demonstrated for four target detection methods (TG, H-TF, chlorpyrifos, and acetamiprid) and two fluorescence dyes (PG and SGI). Therefore, the aptasensor provides expansive prospects for developing a simple, general, costeffective detection."
