Here we study a photonic Chern insulator with saturable nonlinearity and show the existence of topological bulk solitons. The fundamental bulk solitons exhibit as semi-vortex solitons, where only one pseudospin component has a nonzero vorticity. The bulk solitons have equal angular momentum at different valleys. This phenomenon is a direct outcome of the topology of the linear host lattice and the angular momentum can be changed by switching the sign of the nonlinearity. The bulk solitons bifurcate from the linear bulk band edge and terminate when their powers saturate. We find that these bulk solitons are stable within the whole spectrum range. Moreover, these bulk solitons are robust against lattice disorders both from on-site energies and hopping amplitudes. Our work extends the study of Chern insulators into the nonlinear regime and highlights the interplay between topology and nonlinearity. https://doi.org/10.1038/s42005-022-01058-z OPEN",

Different objects are topologically equivalent as long as they have the same topological invariant. By describing the global structure of the wave function in momentum space over the Brillouin zone (BZ) as a topological invariant, the concept of topology was introduced into condensed matter physics with the advent of topological insulators, which are insulating in the bulk but conducting on their surfaces even in the presence of impurities1,2. Shortly after the discovery of topological insulators, the photonic analogs of topological insulators based on quantum Hall effect, namely the photonic Chern insulators were proposed and realized3\u20135. Later, based on the photonic Chern insulators which are characterized by the integervalued Chern numbers, photonic Floquet topological insulators6,7, photonic spin-Hall insulators8\u201312 and photonic valley-Hall insulators13\u201320 were reported successively, and the field of topological photonics has flourished21\u201324. Among all these two-dimensional (2D) photonic topological insulators, photonic Chern insulators are the most reliable designs to date that provide truly unidirectional and backscattering-immune wave transport due to the genuine breakdown of time-reversal symmetry25. They have been reported experimentally in gyromagnetic photonic crystals at microwave frequencies5 and active resonator networks at optical frequencies26.\nThe investigation of photonic topological insulators has been extended into the nonlinear regime with the inclusion of the interparticle interactions27. By combining topology with nonlinearity, a kind of solitons dubbed \u201cbulk solitons\u201d are found (without the linear counterpart) in the bulk topological bandgap28. Unlike the nonlinear edge states or edge solitons29\u201336, the bulk solitons reside in the bulk of materials. Meanwhile, these bulk solitons are also different to the conventional lattice solitons37. Lattice solitons are formed as a result of the balance between coupling (commonly referred as diffraction) and nonlinearity. Bulk solitons occur at the nonlinearity induced topological interfaces. Until now, 1D bulk solitons have been demonstrated in Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) chains38\u201341, and 2D bulk solitons have been demonstrated in both photonic Floquet insulators28,42,43 and photonic valley-Hall insulators38,44.\nIn this paper, we extend the photonic Chern insulators into the nonlinear regime and study the bulk solitons under a saturable nonlinearity, since the properties of static Chern insulators are fundamentally different from that of driven Floquet insulators7,45. In contrast to the photonic Floquet insulators which are driven lattice systems with time-reversal symmetry breaking replaced by z-reversal symmetry breaking28,42, our photonic Chern insulator is a non-driven lattice and the actual time-reversal symmetry is broken. We find that the bulk solitons bifurcate from the linear bulk band edge of the energy spectrum (rather than the quasi-energy spectrum of a photonic Floquet topological insulator28,42), and terminate when their powers saturate. The fundamental bulk solitons exhibit as semi-vortex solitons, where only one pseudospin component has a nonzero vorticity. Due to the topology of the photonic Chern insulator in the linear limit, the bulk solitons have equal angular momentum at different valleys. This phenomenon is a direct outcome of the topology of the linear host lattice. The angular momentum of the bulk soliton is changed when the self-focusing nonlinearity is switched to the selfdefocusing nonlinearity. Finally, we also demonstrate the stability and robustness of the bulk solitons. Our results extend the study of Chern insulators into the nonlinear regime and highlight the interplay between topology and nonlinearity."

It is described by a tight-binding Hamiltonian with a real nearest-neighbor (NN) hopping (black lines), a complex next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) hopping (red and blue arrows) and on-site staggering energies (white and black circles), as shown in Fig. 1a.

In the linear limit with g= 0, due to the time-reversal symmetry breaking, the bulk bands split and lead to a complete bandgap with K and K\u2032 valleys (See Supplementary Note 1).

Note that Eqs. (3), (4) reduce to the continuous linear Dirac equations when d3= g= 046. Besides, unlike the 2D nonlinear Dirac equations where nonlinearity is equivalent to a mass term44, in our model nonlinearity changes both the effective frequency shift and effective mass (see Supplementary Note 2).\nThe solutions for bulk solitons can be found by solving Eqs. (3), (4) using Newton-conjugate-gradient method47. With the harmonic time dependence e i\u03c9t , we have\nL0\u03a8 \u00bc 0; \u00f05\u00de where\nL0 \u00bc d0 \u00fe d3 \u03c9\u00fe N1 vF \u00b1 i \u2202\u2202x \u00fe \u2202\u2202y\nvF \u00b1 i \u2202 \u2202x \u2202\u2202y\nd0 d3 \u03c9\u00fe N2\n0 B@\n1 CA \u00f06\u00de\nand \u03a8 \u00bc \u00f0\u03c81;\u03c82\u00deT .

For simplicity, we let \u03c9A \u00bc \u03c9B \u00bc 10, and thus we have d3 \u00bc \u00b1 3 ffiffi 3 p t2 for K and K\u2032 valleys, respectively. The other\nparameters are a \u00bc 1; t1 \u00bc 2= ffiffi 3 p ; t2 \u00bc 1=3 ffiffi 3 p , and \u03c3= 1. In the linear limit, the bulk bands create a bandgap where the central frequency is \u03c9 \u00bc d0 \u00bc 10 and the bandgap half-width is jd3j \u00bc 1. In the nonlinear case, we only study the fundamental modes because the higher-order solitons are usually unstable48. Figure 2 shows the bulk solitons for the self-focusing nonlinearity with g= 1 and the frequency is \u03c9= 9.1. For the bulk soliton at K valley (Fig. 2a, b), the pseudospin component \u03c82 decreases monotonously from a finite value to zero along the radial direction, but the amplitude of \u03c81 features a hump at a nonzero radius. This single hump behavior with a ring shape is different with the soliton profile for a nonlinear Dirac equation44. From the phase distributions shown in the insets, the phase of the pseudospin\nCOMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS | (2022) 5:275 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42005-022-01058-z | www.nature.com/commsphys 3\ncomponent \u03c81 increases clockwise by 2\u03c0 and thus has a vorticity with l1 \u00bc 1 around r= 0. The component \u03c82 has a zero vorticity with l2 \u00bc 0. The vorticity is defined as l1;2 \u00bc 1 2\u03c0 H L\u2207\u00bdarg \u00f0\u03c81;2\u00de dl with the time dependence dropped49. Since only one component has a nonzero vorticity, the bulk soliton at K valley is a semi-vortex soliton.\nThe semi-vortex soliton is not a direct outcome of the nonlinearity-induced localization of the linear bulk states. The linear bulk states exhibit sublattice polarizations at the K and K\u2032 valleys, and have nonzero vorticities induced by the phase terms exp\u00f0iK r\u00de and exp\u00f0iK0 r\u00de (see Supplementary Note 1). While for the bulk soliton here, it exhibits the vorticity in the absence of the phase terms. Similar to the bulk solitons in photonic Floquet insulators28,42 and photonic valley-Hall insulators38,44, our bulk soliton in the photonic Chern insulator can also be understood as the topological edge state residing in the bulk. Nonlinearity induces a mass inversion and creates a topological domain wall in the bulk (see Supplementary Note 2). Along the domain wall, the localized state known as the Jackiw\u2013Rebbi Dirac boundary mode exists50. The bulk soliton shown in Fig. 2a, b can be directly obtained from the Jackiw\u2013Rebbi mode by smoothly changing the parameters \u03c3 and \u03c9.\nWe also would like to note that the bulk soliton is topologically protected from two aspects. First, the bulk soliton is protected by the topology of the linear host lattice in momentum space. The nonzero Chern number of the linear bulk band implies the existence of a bulk topological bandgap. As long as the linear bulk bandgap is open, nonlinearity can create a topological domain wall and support the existence of the bulk soliton. Second, the bulk soliton is also topologically protected in real space because one of its components has nonzero vorticity.\nSimilarly, from Fig. 2c, d, the bulk soliton at K\u2032 is also a semivortex soliton. The difference is that, the pseudospin component \u03c81 has a zero vorticity with l1 \u00bc 0 and the component \u03c82 has a nonzero vorticity with l2 \u00bc 1. Such behavior is related to the topology of the linear host lattice. In the linear Haldane model, time-reversal symmetry is broken but inversion symmetry is preserved. Since d3 has opposite signs at the K and K\u2032 valleys, we have equal Berry curvatures with \u03a9\u00f0K\u00de \u00bc \u03a9\u00f0K0\u00de and non-zero Chern numbers for the bulk bands25. Due to the inversion symmetry with d3\u00f0K\u00de \u00bc d3\u00f0K 0\u00de, according to Eqs. (3), (4), if we make transformations \u03c81 ! \u03c82 and \u03c82 ! \u03c81 to the equations at K valley, we can get the equations at K\u2032 valley. Thus, the bulk solitons at K and K\u2032 valleys both rotate clockwise with a phase difference of \u03c0. In other words, the bulk solitons at different valleys have equal angular momentum. Note that for a photonic valley-Hall insulator, the bulk solitons at K and K\u2032 valleys rotate in opposite directions (see Supplementary Note 3). Figure 3 shows the bulk solitons for the self-defocusing nonlinearity with g=\u22121 and the frequency is \u03c9= 10.9. The bulk solitons at K and K\u2032 valleys are also semi-vortex solitons and they rotate counterclockwise with a phase difference of \u03c0. Compared with the bulk solitons in Fig. 2, the rotating direction is switched by the sign of nonlinearity. This implies that the self-defocusing nonlinearity can also be used to induce the topological interface and create bulk solitons in photonic topological insulators.\nTo give more insights into the bulk solitons, we transform Eqs. (3), (4) into polar coordinate system and get\ni \u2202\u03c81 \u2202t \u00bc vFe i\u03c6 \u00b1 i \u2202 \u2202r \u00fe 1 r \u2202 \u2202\u03c6 \u03c82 \u00fe \u00f0d3 \u00fe N1\u00de\u03c81; \u00f09\u00de\n4 COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS | (2022) 5:275 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42005-022-01058-z | www.nature.com/commsphys\ni \u2202\u03c82 \u2202t \u00bc vFe \u00b1 i\u03c6 \u00b1 i \u2202 \u2202r 1 r \u2202 \u2202\u03c6 \u03c81 \u00f0d3 N2\u00de\u03c82: \u00f010\u00de\nHere the term d0 is dropped by a gauge transformation \u03c81;2\u00f0r; t\u00de \u00bc \u03c81;2\u00f0r; t\u00de exp\u00f0 id0t\u00de. We seek for 2D bulk solitons with harmonic time dependence and radial symmetry. First, we study the equations at K valley. If d3 > 0, we substitute\n\u03c81 \u03c82 \u00bc iue\ni\u00f0m\u00fe1\u00de\u03c6\nve im\u03c6\n! e i\u03c9t \u00f011\u00de\ninto Eqs.

These equations can be numerically solved and admit the existence of solutions for semi-vortex solitons38. If d3 < 0, we substitute\n\u03c81 \u03c82 \u00bc ue\nim\u03c6\nivei\u00f0m\u00fe1\u00de\u03c6\ne i\u03c9t \u00f014\u00de\ninto Eqs.

(12), (13) and also have semi-vortex soliton solutions. Then we study the equations at K\u2032 valley. If d3>0, we substitute\n\u03c81 \u03c82 \u00bc iue\ni\u00f0m\u00fe1\u00de\u03c6\nveim\u03c6\n! e i\u03c9t \u00f017\u00de\nand get the same equations as Eqs. (12), (13). If d3 < 0, we substitute\n\u03c81 \u03c82 \u00bc ue\nim\u03c6\nive i\u00f0m\u00fe1\u00de\u03c6\ne i\u03c9t \u00f018\u00de\nand get the same equations as Eqs. (15), (16). In our model, we have d3>0 and d3 < 0 at K and K\u2032 valleys, respectively. For the bulk solitons at K valley, the solutions with m= 0 and m=\u22121 in Eq. (11) are the fundamental modes for selffocusing nonlinearity with g > 0 and self-defocusing nonlinearity with g < 0, respectively. The solution for the bulk soliton in Fig. 2a, b is \u00f0\u03c81;\u03c82\u00deT \u00bc \u00f0iue i\u03c6; v\u00deT , and the bulk soliton in Fig. 3a, b can be written as \u00f0\u03c81;\u03c82\u00deT \u00bc \u00f0u; ivei\u03c6\u00deT . Similarly, for the bulk solitons at K\u2032 valley, the solutions with m= 0 and m=\u22121 in Eq. (18) are the fundamental modes for self-focusing nonlinearity with g > 0 and selfdefocusing nonlinearity with g < 0, respectively. The solution for the bulk soliton in Fig. 2c, d is \u00f0\u03c81;\u03c82\u00deT \u00bc \u00f0u; ive i\u03c6\u00deT , and the bulk soliton in Fig. 3c, d can be written as \u00f0\u03c81;\u03c82\u00deT \u00bc \u00f0iuei\u03c6; v\u00deT . Thus, we validate the fact that the bulk solitons at different valleys have the equal angular momentum and the rotating direction can be changed by the sign of nonlinearity. Similar discussion can also be carried out for the bulk solitons in a photonic valley-Hall insulator (See Supplementary Note 3).\nWe discuss the mode distributions of the bulk solitons. As an example, we consider the bulk solitons at K valley under the selffocusing nonlinearity (Fig. 2a, b) and Eqs. (12), (13) with m= 0 are their governing equations. In the limit of r\u2192 0, we have u\n(r= 0) = 0 and v\u2019 (r= 0) = 0. In the limit of r=\u221e, mode localization requires that u (r=\u221e) = v (r=\u221e) = 0. The contribution from the nonlinear terms is small and Eqs. (12), (13) are reduced to the linear differential equations. Since the bulk solitons reside in the bulk bandgap with j\u03c9j< jd3j51, the solutions are\nu\u00f0r\u00de \u00bc CKm\u00fe1\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi d23 \u03c92 q vF r 0 @ 1 A; \u00f019\u00de\nv\u00f0r\u00de \u00bc C ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi d3 \u03c9 d3 \u00fe \u03c9 s Km\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi d23 \u03c92 q vF r 0 @ 1 A; \u00f020\u00de\nwith m= 0. Considering these limiting values, the pseudospin component \u03c81 exhibits a hump at a nonzero radius and the component \u03c82 decreases monotonously from a finite value to zero along the radial direction. These results agree well with the soliton distribution in Fig. 2a, b.\nExistence. We study the existence of the bulk solitons. We only show the results for the bulk solitons at K valley since the results at K\u2032 valley can be obtained from the transformations \u03c81 ! \u03c82 and \u03c82 ! \u03c81. Figure 4a, b shows the radial distributions of the bulk solitons, where the parameters are a= 1, \u03c9A \u00bc \u03c9B \u00bc 10, t1 \u00bc 2= ffiffi 3 p , t2 \u00bc 1=3 ffiffi 3 p , g= 1, and \u03c3= 1. Under the selffocusing nonlinearity, the amplitudes of both the two components increase when the frequency \u03c9 approaches the central frequency of the bandgap. We define P1;2 \u00bc\nR j\u03c81;2\u00f0r\u00dej2d2r as the optical powers for the pseudospin components \u03c81;2. From Fig. 4c, both the curves for P1 and P2 are monotonic. The bulk solitons bifurcate from the lower band edge at \u03c9= 9 and reside in the topological bandgap. When the optical powers are large enough, the bulk soliton terminates and its frequency saturates near \u03c9= 10, which corresponds to the center of the bandgap. To quantify the degree of localization of the bulk solitons as a function of frequency, we plot the inverse participation ratios\n(IPRs) which are defined as IPR1;2 \u00bc R\nj\u03c81;2\u00f0r\u00dej4d2rR j\u03c81;2\u00f0r\u00dej2d2r\n2, as a measure of the localizations of the bulk solitons. From Fig. 4d, the size (i.e., spatial extent) of the bulk solitons decreases to a minimum near the center of the existence range. In other words, bulk solitons closer to the linear band edge and bandgap center have larger spatial extents. This quantitative result agrees with the amplitude distributions in Fig. 4a, b. We also show the power and IPR of the bulk solitons under the self-defocusing nonlinearity with g=\u22121 in Fig. 4e, f, respectively. In contrast to the bulk solitons under the self-focusing nonlinearity, the bulk solitons under the selfdefocusing nonlinearity bifurcate from the upper band edge at \u03c9= 11. Thus, the sign of nonlinearity can also change the bifurcation and existence range of the bulk solitons.\nStability. We study the stability of the bulk solitons. As an example, we only show the results for the bulk solitons at K valley under the self-focusing nonlinearity, where the parameters are a= 1, \u03c9A \u00bc \u03c9B \u00bc 10, t1 \u00bc 2= ffiffi 3 p , t2 \u00bc 1=3 ffiffi 3 p , g= 1, and \u03c3= 1. First, we perform the linear stability analysis by following a standard linearization procedure. The solution is sought at the frequency \u03b4 in the form of\n\u03c81 \u00bc e i\u03c9t \u03d51 \u00fe \u03b51e i\u03b4t \u00fe \u03bc*1ei\u03b4 *t ; \u00f021\u00de\n\u03c82 \u00bc e i\u03c9t \u03d52 \u00fe \u03b52e i\u03b4t \u00fe \u03bc*2ei\u03b4 *t ; \u00f022\u00de\nCOMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS | (2022) 5:275 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42005-022-01058-z | www.nature.com/commsphys 5\nwhere \u03d51;2e i\u03c9t are the unperturbed soliton solution, \u03b51;2 and \u03bc1;2 are the infinitesimal amplitudes of the perturbations. Obviously, the bulk solitons are linearly stable if \u03b4 is real. They are linearly unstable if the imaginary part of \u03b4, namely the growth rate, is positive. Substituting the perturbed solutions into Eqs. (3), (4), we get the linearized equations regarding to \u03b51, \u03bc1, \u03b52, and \u03bc2. The linearized equations can then be numerically solved using Fourier collocation method combined with Newton-conjugate-gradient method47.\nFigure 5a shows the growth rates Im(\u03b4) for the bulk solitons at different frequencies. In the whole frequency range, the growth rates are in the order of 10 6. Note that the perturbations may come from both the amplitudes and phases. For the perturbation eigenmode with a certain vorticity q, the solution can be written as\n\u03c81 \u03c82 \u00bc \u00bd ~\u03d51 ~\u03d52\n! \u00fe ~\u03b51\n~\u03b52\ne iq\u03c6e i\u03b4t \u00fe ~\u03bc\n* 1 ~\u03bc*2\n! eiq\u03c6ei\u03b4 *t e i\u03c6\n1\ne i\u03c9t : \u00f023\u00de We show the perturbation eigenmodes \u03b51;2 with \u03c9= 9.35 in Fig. 5b, c, since the growth rate is largest at this frequency (corresponding to the red dot in Fig. 5a). From the figures, the growth rates shown in Fig. 5a correspond to the perturbation eigenmodes with q= 0. The contributions from the higher-order perturbations with q \u2260 0 are negligible. Based on the above results and using the Vakhitov\u2013Kolokolov (VK) stability criterion, we can conclude that the bulk solitons are linearly stable within the whole spectrum range, although the growth rates are not exactly equal to zero due to the numerical errors. VK criterion predicts the instability of the solitons with dP/d\u03c9 < 0 and provides the necessary stability condition dP/d\u03c9 > 052,53. Usually for solitons without vortices, dP/d\u03c9 > 0 is also a sufficient stability condition, because the perturbation eigenmodes have q= 0 and there are no azimuthal perturbations with q \u2260 054. From Fig. 4c, the power P2 dominates the total power and we have dP2=d\u03c9>0 within the whole spectrum range. Since the pseudospin component \u03c82 has a zero vorticity, the contributions from the azimuthal perturbations\n6 COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS | (2022) 5:275 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42005-022-01058-z | www.nature.com/commsphys\nwith q \u2260 0 (namely the perturbations from phases) are negligible. Thus, according to the VK criterion, the bulk solitons are linearly stable. Physically, the bulk solitons are stabilized by the saturable nonlinearity. The bulk solitons under the nonsaturable Kerr nonlinearity become unstable when the frequency exceeds a threshold, because there exists a range for dP2/d\u03c9 < 0 (see Supplementary Note 3). The saturable nonlinearity suppresses the continuous decrease of the spatial size of the solitons and changes the slopes of the existence curves. Then the high-frequency solitons become stable and all the bulk solitons in the whole spectrum range are stable.\nNext, we further confirm the stability of the bulk solitons by directly simulating Eqs. (3), (4) based on Runge-Kutta method in the spectrum domain. The evolution time is t= 10,000, which is long enough to observe the soliton dynamics. When the initial input is selected as the soliton solution with \u03c9= 9.35, we observe the stationary evolution of the bulk soliton, as shown in Fig. 6a, b. When \u00b15% noises with uniform distributions are added to the initial input, although the bulk soliton experiences a transverse displacement, the bulk soliton still exhibits as a semi-vortex soliton and the radii of the isosurfaces are invariant during the temporal evolution (Fig. 6c, d), unlike the breathing or collapse of the unstable solitons under Kerr nonlinearity (see Supplementary Note 4). This behavior confirms that, although the pseudospin component \u03c81 has a nonzero vorticity, the bulk solitons are only disturbed by the radially symmetric perturbations with q= 0 and there is no radial symmetry breaking. These results valid the fact that the bulk solitons are stable in the whole spectrum range.\nRobustness. Since the bulk solitons are nonlinearity induced topological edge states, it is crucial to study their robustness against lattice disorders. We study the robustness of the bulk solitons by adding disorders to the parameters in Eqs. (3), (4) and observing the temporal evolution of the bulk solitons under a noiseless input. As an example, we only show the robustness of the bulk soliton with \u03c9= 9.35 at K valley under the self-focusing nonlinearity. The parameters are a= 1, \u03c9A \u00bc \u03c9B \u00bc 10, t1 \u00bc 2= ffiffi 3 p , t2 \u00bc 1=3 ffiffi 3 p , g= 1, and \u03c3= 1. The evolution time is also set as t= 10,000. The parameters \u03c9A;B, t1, t2, g, and \u03c3 can be treated as two kinds: \u03c9A;B, g, and \u03c3 are the (equivalent) on-site energies; and t1 and t2 are the hopping amplitudes.\nFirst, we add \u00b15% disorders with uniform distributions to both g and \u03c3, and the result is shown in Fig. 7a, b. Since the nonlinearity is a perturbation to the on-site energies, disorders from the nonlinear parameter g and saturation coefficient \u03c3 only induce a small drift of the soliton center in xy plane [see the soliton trajectory in Fig. 7a and Supplementary Movie 1] and the soliton profile has no deformation (Fig. 7b). Here we only demonstrate the amplitude of the pseudospin component \u03c81 at the output with t= 10,000 because \u03c81 has a small optical power (Fig. 4c) and it should be more sensitive to the disorders.\nSecond, we add \u00b15% disorders to both \u03c9A and \u03c9B. In contrast to the first case, the bulk soliton shows a considerable random drift (Fig. 7c and Supplementary Movie 2). Since periodic boundary conditions are imposed in the numerical simulations of Eqs. (3), (4), the bulk soliton can move out the simulation domain from one boundary and reenter from the opposite boundary. Besides, from the amplitude of \u03c82 shown in Fig. 7d, there is a\nCOMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS | (2022) 5:275 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42005-022-01058-z | www.nature.com/commsphys 7\ndeformation of the soliton profile. Considering the structure disorders, we find that the upper and lower band edges are governed by \u03c90 \u03b4\u03c9\u00b1 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi \u00f0 \u03b4\u03c9\u00fe 1\u00de2 p , where \u03c9A \u00bc \u03c9B \u00bc \u03c90 and \u03b4\u03c9 is the strength of the disorders. Since the robustness of a topological edge state is guaranteed only when the disorders do not close the bulk bandgap, the disorder strength \u03b4\u03c9 should be smaller than 0.5. Thus, the robustness of bulk soliton is degraded due to the large disorders from on-site energies.\nThird, we add \u00b15% disorders to t1. Since the change of the NN hopping amplitude does not affect the central frequency and bandgap width of the linear bulk band structure, the bulk soliton in this case has no deformation (Fig. 4f). During temporal evolution, the bulk soliton exhibits a random transverse drift because of the breakdown of the periodicity of the lattice (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Movie 3).\nFinally, we add \u00b15% disorders to t2. Although the NNN hopping controls the bandgap width, the bandgap exists as long as we have t2 \u00b1 \u03b4t2 \u2260 0. This condition is satisfied obviously. The bulk soliton does not deform during temporal evolution (Fig. 4h), although it also experiences a transverse drift (Fig. 4g and Supplementary Movie 4).\nRegarding to the lattice disorders, our bulk solitons are robust to the disorders from g, \u03c3, t1, and t2; and only weakly perturbed by the disorders from the on-site energies \u03c9A;B. Experimentally it is possible to reduce the on-site disorders to less than \u00b15% or observe the bulk solitons within a short period42. Besides, the bulk solitons are also topologically protected in real space. From Fig. 7b, d, f, and h and Supplementary Movies 1\u20134, although there are disorders from on-site energies or hopping amplitudes, the first pseudospin components still have nonzero vorticity. Thus, the bulk solitons are robust against the lattice disorders both from on-site energies and hopping amplitudes within the whole spectrum range, and the intervalley conversion of the bulk solitons is prohibited.\nComparison with discrete bulk solitons. In Figs. 2\u20137, the bulk solitons are obtained by solving the continuous model based on\nEqs. (3), (4). Here we show the discrete bulk solitons directly calculated from Eqs. (1), (2) and compare them with the continuous ones. For simplicity, we only consider the discrete bulk solitons at K valley under the self-focusing nonlinearity. The parameters are \u03c9A \u00bc \u03c9B \u00bc 10, a= 1, t1 \u00bc 2= ffiffi 3 p , t2 \u00bc 1=3 ffiffi 3 p , g= 1, and \u03c3= 1. Figure 8a, b shows the discrete bulk soliton with the frequency \u03c9= 9.1. Similar to the continuous bulk soliton in Fig. 2a, b, the amplitude of \u03c81 features a hump at a nonzero radius and the pseudospin component \u03c82 exhibits a peak at the lattice center. From the phase distributions, near the lattice centers, the phase of the pseudospin component \u03c81 increases clockwise by 2\u03c0 and the phase of the component \u03c82 is zero. The phase distortions away from the lattice centers are created by the discrete lattice configuration. Thus, the discrete bulk solitons are also semi-vortex solitons. Similarly, Fig. 8c, d shows the discrete bulk soliton with the frequency \u03c9= 9.9. The discrete bulk soliton extends to more lattice sites and this behavior agrees with that of the continuous bulk solitons (Fig. 4a, b). Besides, in Fig. 8e, f, we show the full lattice distribution of the discrete bulk soliton with \u03c9= 9.9, where (e) and (f) correspond to the amplitude and phase, respectively. Unlike the continuous bulk solitons (Figs. 5 and 6), the discrete bulk solitons are unstable within the whole spectrum range (see Supplementary Note 5). To stabilize the discrete bulk solitons, we need to decrease the lattice period a and increase the NN hopping t1 51."

            "text": "We have several remarks here. First, from the above results, the (continuous) bulk solitons reside in a complete topological bandgap, and they are stable and robust within the whole spectrum range. Because of these features, it is feasible to observe the bulk solitons experimentally in a photonic Chern insulator. In the microwave frequency, linear photonic Chern insulators have been realized in gyromagnetic photonic crystals5,55. Nonlinearity can be introduced into the photonic crystals using nonlinear elements\n8 COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS | (2022) 5:275 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42005-022-01058-z | www.nature.com/commsphys\nCOMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS | (2022) 5:275 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42005-022-01058-z | www.nature.com/commsphys 9\nsuch as varactors56. In the optical frequency, a linear photonic Chern insulator is also realized using active resonator networks26. Nonlinearity can be easily incorporated by using nonlinear materials and high input power. Besides, electrical circuit lattices have been proposed recently as the low-frequency counterparts of the photonic topological insulators57. Since both Chern circuits and nonlinear topological circuits have been demonstrated33,58, it is feasible to implement a nonlinear Chern circuit and observe the bulk solitons. The theoretical results presented here are not specific to classical photonic systems. They are also applicable to photonic lattices realized in atomic systems59\u201361 and excitonpolariton systems40,62,63.\nSecond, we would like to compare our results with the bulk solitons in a photonic Floquet insulator28. Our paper reveals\nseveral features that were not discovered previously. Our bulk solitons are found under the saturable nonlinearity, in contrast to the Kerr nonlinearity used in the photonic Floquet insulator. Due to the saturable nonlinearity, our bulk solitons are stable and robust, but the bulk solitons in the photonic Floquet insulator are unstable. We also find that the angular momenta of the bulk solitons at different valleys are linked to the topology of the linear host lattice and the angular momenta can be switched by the sign of the nonlinearity. These behaviors were not reported in previous publications.\nThird, we would like to point out that the bulk solitons also exist at other k points. At a general k point, Eqs. (3), (4) are generalized to the general form of the nonlinear Dirac equations, which admit the existence of soliton solutions (see Supplementary\n10 COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS | (2022) 5:275 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42005-022-01058-z | www.nature.com/commsphys\nNote 6). However, in order to get a more accurate result when compared with the discrete bulk solitons calculated from Eqs. (1), (2), higher-order expansions should be considered because the dispersions are nonlinear at general k points."
