Investigation of MASP49 and Other MASP Family Proteins' Interaction with Different Host Cell Types: A detailed study on how MASP49 and other members of the MASP family interact with a broader range of mammalian cell types, including immune cells beyond macrophages and non-immune cells such as endothelial and neural cells. This research could elucidate the versatility of MASPs in host infection mechanisms and identify specific host cell receptors involved in these interactions.

Characterization of the Post-translational Modifications of MASP49: Given the importance of glycosylation in MASP49's interaction with host cells, a comprehensive analysis of its post-translational modifications, especially focusing on glycan structures, could provide insights into how these modifications affect the protein's function, stability, and host receptor binding affinity. This could also extend to studying how variations in glycosylation patterns among different T. cruzi strains influence infection efficiency and pathogenicity.

Development of MASP49 Inhibitors as Potential Therapeutic Agents: The significant reduction in parasite entry into host cells upon blockade of MASP49 suggests its potential as a therapeutic target. Research could be directed towards developing small molecule inhibitors, antibodies, or peptides that specifically target MASP49 to prevent T. cruzi infection. These studies could include the design, synthesis, and in vitro/in vivo testing of such inhibitors.

Role of MASP49 in T. cruzi Evasion of Host Immune Response: Exploring how MASP49 and its glycosylation patterns contribute to the parasite's evasion of the host immune response, including studies on how it influences the recognition by immune cells and the activation of immune pathways. This could involve investigating MASP49's interaction with immune cell receptors and its potential to modulate immune responses to benefit parasite survival and proliferation.

Structural Analysis of MASP49 and Its Complexes with Host Receptors: Employing advanced structural biology techniques such as cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and X-ray crystallography to solve the structure of MASP49 alone and in complex with its host cell receptors, particularly mMGL. Understanding the structural basis of the MASP49-receptor interaction could reveal new insights into the mechanism of parasite entry and identify potential intervention points for disrupting this process.
