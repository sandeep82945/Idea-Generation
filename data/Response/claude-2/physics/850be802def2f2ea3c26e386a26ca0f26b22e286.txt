 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming the paper:

1. Develop new methods for N-O bond cleavage using sustainable catalysts like iron or nickel instead of expensive transition metals like rhodium or palladium. This could make the reactions more cost-effective and environmentally friendly.

2. Explore enantioselective versions of the reactions to synthesize chiral N-heterocycles. Only a couple examples were demonstrated so far, so more work on asymmetric catalysis could be impactful.

3. Apply the oxime and hydroxylamine cyclization strategies to synthesize novel medicinal compounds or natural product scaffolds. The methods seem well suited for building privileged heterocyclic motifs.

4. Investigate the mechanism of the radical-mediated reactions in more detail using computational methods or physical organic techniques. This could lead to better control and predictability.

5. Combine the N-O bond cleavage strategy with other innovative modes of activation like photoredox catalysis or electrochemistry. The merger of multiple catalytic cycles in one system could enable new reactivity.
