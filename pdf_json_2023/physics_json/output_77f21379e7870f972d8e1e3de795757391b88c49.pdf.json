Gluten comprises 12 two major proteins: glutenin and gliadin. Gliadin, in particular, possesses a unique 13 hydrophobic amino acid sequence. The Food and Drug Administration asserts that the 14 toxicity of gliadin cannot be eliminated through fermentation and hydrolysis 15 processes. A common approach to addressing gluten allergies is to adopt a gluten-free 16 diet. However, the hydrophobic nature of gluten makes its detection challenging. 17 Analysts often resort to using organic solvents or employing multiple procedures to 18 denature gluten for extraction. It's worth noting that while organic solvents can 19\nerroneous bio-test results. 21 22 Ionic liquid (IL) is a highly adaptable green chemical compound consisting of organic 23 salts. We modified imidazolium, a cationic structure, with various carbon side chain 24 lengths (C=0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 12), and combined it with organic and inorganic anions 25 (e.g., OMs-, Cl-, F-, NO\u00ac3-, HSO4-, and H2PO4-). We used different IL-to-water 26 ratios to assess gluten solubility. We measured the solubility of gliadin in various 27 imidazolium ILs and conducted kinetic studies on the dissolution of gliadin in 1% 28 [C5DMIM][OMs]aq. Additionally, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and 29 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were employed to evaluate the 30 structural changes in gliadin and its interaction with antibodies after treatment with 31 1% [C5DMIM][OMs]aq. An XTT assay was conducted to assess the cytotoxicity of 32 [C5DMIM][OMs]aq on N2a cells. 33 34 Our research findings indicate that 1% [C5DMIM][OMs]aq demonstrated excellent 35 gluten solubility, dissolving more than 3000 ppm of gluten within 5 minutes. 36 Importantly, [C5DMIM][OMs]aq did not disrupt the gluten structure, did not impede 37 antibody binding to gluten, and exhibited no cell toxicity. This report highlights 38\n40 Introduction: 41 Around 0.5%~6% of people worldwide have celiac disease or non-celiac gluten 42 sensitivity (NCGS)1-5. Celiac disease and NCGS are food allergy diseases, and the 43 reason comes from gluten-induced immune responses that attack the body6, 7. Gluten 44 allergy symptoms include bloating, chronic diarrhea, depression, anxiety, etc. It raises 45 the risks of enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL), non-Hodgkin's 46 lymphoma, and adenocarcinoma of the small intestines when celiac patients do not 47 control their gluten intake8-10. 48 49 Gluten is a major food allergen worldwide, and it is comprised of two major 50 proteins: glutenin and gliadin11. Glutenin is water soluble, while gliadin is insoluble in 51 water. Some research claimed that gliadin appears to be the primary cause of celiac 52 disease. Gliadin contains gliadin groups (alpha/beta, omega, and gamma) and gliadin 53 subunits (high- (HMW) and low-molecular weight (LMW)). Regardless of the kind of 54 gliadin, gliadins are capable of aggregating into larger oligomers and interacting with 55 other gluten proteins due to large hydrophobic sections12, 13, poly-Q, and repetitive 56 sequences14-16. These sections are likely to aggregate hydrophobically17, separate in 57\nthe liquid-liquid phase, potentially form \u03b2-sheet aggregates18, or simply become 58 entangled by their structural properties. Detection of gluten is difficult due to the 59 effects of hydrophobicity and aggregation. Analysts need to use organic solvents or 60 spend more time pretreating a sample to extract gliadin from a sample. Recently, 61 scientists have tried to use certain enzymes to hydrolyze gluten to decrease its 62 toxicity19-21, but still no useful process has been found to decrease the toxicity 22, 23 63 according to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) publication in 2022. 64 65 Although food technology keeps progressing, the only good way to so far treat a 66 gluten allergy is to avoid consuming gluten. Generally for gluten analysis, an enzyme-67 linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is the main gluten detection system. An ELISA 68 has high specificity for gluten antibodies. However, gluten is difficult to dissolve in 69 water solutions, especially in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 24. Analysts need to 70 pretreat samples with 75% alcohol or spend time heating the sample in solutions 25-27. 71 Alcohol is detrimental to antibodies, as it can induce antibody mutations causing them 72 to lose their function. Therefore, the analyst needs to transfer alcohol to buffer system 73 (e.g. PBS buffer) to reduce its effects on the antibody. It is a complicated process 74 which takes time to pretreat samples, regardless of the process chosen. 75 76\nanions28, 29. In most cases, the cation or anion is tetraalkyl ammonium, tetraalkyl 78 phosphonium, imidazolium, cholinium, or pyridinium. ILs function can be varied by 79 modifying side chains, and they can have different physical and chemical effects by 80 changing the anions29. ILs can be applied to heavy metals30, little molecular31 81 extraction and also to stable protein structures32. Based on the ability to modify ILs, 82 we designed and synthesized different lengths of side chains and anions for rapid 83 extraction of gluten from samples. In this report, we used imidazolium as the major 84 structure, modified with adding different lengths of carbon side chains for interactions 85 with hydrophobic sides of gluten, and changed the anion to increase the solubility of 86 gluten. 87 ILs we synthesized provide the interaction to gliadin protein. Ionic forces come for 88 the salt of hydration radius interact with a protein. Van der Waals forces come for 89 interactions with carbon lengths. Generally, the van der Waals force is increased with 90 length. Since gliadin has special amino acid sequences like poly glutamine and 91 continuous poly proline, these special amino acid sequences induce protein-water 92 insolubility and cause the fiber structure to easily aggregate33, 34. For this special 93 amino acid sequence, we synthesize a suitable side chain of IL to bind to the gliadin 94 protein, to make gliadin soluble in water by for a safe and effective analysis to galidin 95\n97 Results and Discussion: 98 99\nSolubility of gluten in [C5DMIM][OMs]aq 100 Ionic solutions of [pentyl dimethyl imidazolium][methyl sulfonic] 101 ([C5DMIM][OMs]) at concentrations of 0.05, 0.1, 1, 2, 5, and 10 wt% in water were 102 prepared in sample vials. Three grams of gliadin (an excess amount) was added to 10 103 mL of each [C5DMIM][OMs] ionic solution, mixed homogenously by stirring for 30 104 min, and allowed to sit for 5 min for the test example. All sample solutions were 105 centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 3 min and filtered through a 0.22-\u03bcm-pore size filter. 106 Water (0 wt%) was used as the control group. After that, a Wheat/Gluten (Gliadin) 107 ELISA Kit (Crystal Chem, AOAC no. 011804) was used to determine the 108 concentration and solubility of gliadin. Since the [examination/limit?] of the 109 Wheat/Gluten (Gliadin) ELISA Kit was about 100 ppm, the gliadin concentration was 110 determined by diluting sample solutions by at least 50-fold with a corresponding ionic 111 solution in order to calculate their gliadin concentrations. As shown in Fig. 1, gliadin 112 solubility increased when the percentage of [C5DMIM][OMs] was raised from 0% to 113 0.1%, and the maximum value of gliadin solubility was at 3000 ppm of 1% 114\n[C5DMIM][OMs]aq was raised to 10%. 116 117 Side chain effects on gluten solubility in 1 wt% of an IL water solution 118 The special function originates from modifications of the IL side chains. In this 119 report, we synthesized different side chain lengths to test the IL solubility of gluten. In 120 recent years, some reports showed that longer side chains and anions of ILs could 121 penetrate cell membranes and damage cells and macrobiotics35, 36. For this reason, we 122 tried to synthesize a more environmentally friendly ILs and applied them to gluten 123 extraction. 124 We synthesized and prepared 1% IL water solutions of {[hydrogen dimethyl 125 imidazolium][methyl sulfonic] ([HDMIM][OMs]), [trimethyl imidazolium][methyl 126 sulfonic] ([TMIM][OMs]), [propyl dimethyl imidazolium][methyl sulfonic] 127 ([C3DMIM][OMs]), [C5DMIM][OMs],[heptenyl dimethyl imidazolium][methyl 128 sulfonic] ([C7DMIM][OMs]), [nonathyl dimethyl imidazolium][methyl sulfonic] 129 ([C9DMIM[OMs]], and [dodecathyl dimethyl imidazolium][methyl sulfonic] 130 ([C12DMIM][OMs])) in sample vials. Three grams of gluten was added to 10 mL of 1 131 wt% of each IL solution, homogenously mixed by stirring for 30 min, allowed to sit 132 for 5 min, used a 0.22-\u00b5m filter to remove precipitates, and measured the gliadin 133\nAs shown in Fig. 2, gliadin had a higher solubility in the [C5DMPIM][OMs], 135 [C7DMIM][OMs], [C9DMIM][OMs], and [C12DMIM][OMs] IL solutions, in which 136 the corresponding groups attached to the 3-position of 1,2-dimethyl imidazolium had 137 different carbon numbers of 5, 7, 9, and 12, respectively. The [C9DMIM][OMS] and 138 [C12DMIM][OMs] ILs had lower solubilities but higher viscosities, which might be 139 disadvantageous. However, decreasing the length of the carbon chains also reduced 140 toxicity toward the environment35, 36. 141 142 Solubility of gliadin in 1 wt% ionic solutions of ionic compounds with different 143 anions 144 Different anions will have different effects in ILs. The hydrophobicity, 145 hydrophilicity, and melting and boiling points can be controlled by different anions of 146 ILs29, 37. In this report, we changed the anions to test the gluten solubility of ILs. We 147 synthesized and prepared 1% IL water solutions of [C5DMIM][Cl], [C5DMIM][F], 148 [C5DMIM][OMs], [C5DMIM][HSO4], [C5DMIM][NO3], and [C5DMIM][H2PO4] in 149 sample vials, and 3 g of gluten was added to 10 mL of a 1 wt% IL solution, mixed 150 homogenously by stirring for 30 min, allowed to sit for 5 min, used a 0.22-\u00b5m filter to 151 remove precipitates, and measured the gliadin concentration with a gliadin ELISA kit. 152\nhalogen anions was low, and the ionic compound with [OMs-] anions produced the 154 greatest gliadin solubility. Gliadin solubility still had a good effect with certain 155\ninorganic anions (HSO4 -, NO3 -, and H2PO4 -). 156 157 Kinetics of the solubility of gliadin in 1 wt% [C5DMIM][OMs]aq 158 We prepared 1% [C5DMIM][OMs]aq and PBS in sample vials, separately added 159 3 g of gliadin into the vials, homogenously mixed it by shaking the vials, and allowed 160 it to sit for various intervals (0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, and 30 min). We used a 0.22-\u00b5m 161 filter to remove precipitates, and the gliadin solubility was measured with a gliadin 162 ELISA kit. As the control test, PBS was selected to substitute for [C5DMIM][OMs], 163 and the same process as for pretreating the gluten sample was carried out. We used the 164 ELISA to measure the gliadin concentration after pretreatment. 165 PBS is an a well-known buffer system for gliadin extraction28. As shown in Fig. 166 4, the solubility of gliadin with PBS extraction was <5 ppm with a longer time for 167 extraction (red dot), and the solubility of gliadin was >700 ppm in 30 s after 168 [C5DMIM][OMs]aq extraction, and the solubility of gliadin reached its maximum in 5 169 min (black square). 170 171\nCircular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy is very sensitive to the secondary structure 173 of polypeptides and proteins. It is usually used to study the secondary structure (alpha 174 helix/beta sheet) of peptides or proteins. In this report, we used CD spectra to measure 175 the secondary structure of gliadin with/without [C5DMIM][OMs] extraction. A 176 gliadin sample without an IL solution (20 \u03bcM) was prepared from a standard gliadin 177 solution (1 mg/ml) in PBS, which was directly prepared using commercially available 178 gliadin (Leadgene). For the gliadin sample without an IL solution (20 \u03bcM), 1 ml of 179 the solvent was removed by a vacuum, and then 1 ml of 1% of the IL 180 ([C5DMIM][OMs]) solution was added to prepare the sample with IL extraction. 181 A CD Spectrometer (Jasco J-815) was used for the structural analysis of the 182 above-mentioned sample solutions obtained by gliadin-rice noodle sample extraction 183 and a commercially available gliadin product. As shown in Fig. 5, a beta sheet 184 structure was evident between the extracted gliadin and commercially available 185 gliadin (not extracted with the currently conceived ionic solution). Figure 5 shows 186 that gliadin wt1% [C5DMIM][OMs] (red line) was less than gliadin with 1% 187 [C5DMIM][OMs] (black line) at 220~230 nm, which indicates that the IL interacted 188 with gliadin and changed a little bit of its structure. But, generally, the CD spectra 189 were similar between gliadin with and that without [C5DMIM][OMS] treatment, 190\n1% [C5DMIM][OMs] treatment of gliadin. 192 193 Biochemical analysis of gliadin resolved in 1 wt% ionic solutions of 1 wt% 194 [C5DMIM][OMs] 195 Biosensors are a very important technology globally, and this technology is 196 widely used for disease diagnosis, detection of microorganisms and viruses, and all 197 kinds of biomarker tests. The ELISA is widely used in biosensor issues, because it is 198 specific and sensitive for target proteins according to the antibodies used. Certainly, 199 the ELISA is the major biosensor for gluten now. 200 In this report, we used an ELISA to test gliadin binding with an antibody after 201 1% [C5DMIM][OMs] and control (1% sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS)) treatment. The 202 1% IL solution of [C5DMIM][OMs] in water was first prepared. Specific amounts of 203 gliadin were added to the 1 wt% IL solution of [C5DMIM][OMs] to prepare gliadin 204 sample solutions at 1, 2, 3, 5, 7.5, 10, 20, and 40 ppm of gliadin. After that, gliadin 205 concentrations were confirmed by a Wheat/Gluten (Gliadin) ELISA kit. 206 A 96-well empty ELISA plate was coated with 1 \u03bcg/mL of anti-gliadin mouse 207 immunoglobulin G (IgG; 2F, purchased from Antaimmu) and then blocked with 1% 208 bovine serum albumin (BSA) to obtain an ELISA plate for gliadin examination. 209\nfor 5 min, and then the wells were washed by PBS. After removing excess solution, 211 0.1 \u03bcg/mL anti-gliadin human IgA-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (anti-gliadin human 212 IgA 3B7 purchased from Leadgene, and HRP added by the MagicLink\u2122 HRP 213 Antibody Conjugation Kit) was added to react for 15 min, the plate was washed, 214 TMB/H2O2 reagent (T3854, purchased from TCI) was added to react for 10 min, and 215 a 0.5 mol/L sulfuric acid aqueous solution was added to terminate the reaction. The 216 absorbance at 450 nm of all wells on the plate was examined by an ELISA reader 217 (TECAN Infinite 200 PRO). 218 As shown in Fig. 5, the regression line had an R2 value of 0.9942. This indicates 219 that the [C5DMIN][OMs]aq interacted with gliadin to raise the solubility, and the 220 antibody could still bind with gliadin after [C5DMIM][OMs] interaction. 221 For the control test (1% SDS for extraction), the absorbance was lower than the 222 [C5DMIM][OMs] model, and its curve had a maximum at 20 ppm, which probably 223 came from the strong cleaning effect of SDS to remove the antibody original coated 224 onto the plate. 225 226 Gluten recovery rate study with [C5DMIM][OMs] 227 The recovery rate is an important factor of extraction systems, and it will show 228\ngliadin by 1% [C5DMIM][OMs]. Rice noodles are a well-known food without gluten. 230 In this report, we chose rice noodles as a substrate to test the recovery of gliadin by 231 1%[C5DMIM][OMs]. A 1 wt% IL solution of [C5DMIM][OMs] in water was first 232 prepared. Hydrophobic proteins were traditionally extracted by an alcohol solution, so 233 a 75 wt% ethanol solution was also prepared for this test. 234 Three grams of bread flour (Blue Jacket Strong Flour, Lien Hwa Milling) was 235 mixed with 10 mL of 75 wt% ethanol for extraction at room temperature for 5 min to 236 produce standard sample solutions. The sample solutions were centrifuged at 8500 237 rpm for 3 min and filtered with a 0.22-\u03bcm-pore size filter to obtain filtered samples. 238 After filtration, the Wheat/Gluten (Gliadin) ELISA Kit (Crystal Chem, AOAC no. 239 011804) was used to determine gliadin concentrations in the filtered samples. The 240 gliadin concentration was determined by diluting the sample solutions by at least 50-241 fold with the corresponding ionic solution, in order to calculate their gliadin 242 concentrations. In both groups of 75 wt% ethanol extraction, gliadin was higher than 243 2000 ppm. 244 In addition, 40 g of dried gluten-free rice noodles (Organic Rice Noodles, Yuan 245 Shun Food) was first soaked in water to rehydrate the noodles. After rehydration, the 246 rice noodles were drained and soaked in 10 mL of a 200 ppm solution of gliadin in 247\ngluten-free rice noodles had a very large specific surface area (total surface area per 249 unit of bulk volume), and most gliadin was adsorbed by the rice noodles. 250 After the ethanol solvent was evaporated, the gliadin-rice noodles were 251 lyophilized in a container to give a gliadin-rice noodle sample. Ten milliliters of a 1 252 wt% IL solution of [C5DMIM][OMs] (equal volume with the 200 ppm gliadin 253 solution in ethanol) was added to the lyophilized gliadin-rice noodles for extraction at 254 room temperature for 5 min to produce test sample solutions. The sample solutions 255 were centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 3 min and filtered with a 0.22-\u03bcm-pore size filter to 256 obtain filtered samples. All groups were repeated five times. The concentration of 257 gliadin was also determined with the Wheat/Gluten (Gliadin) ELISA Kit (Crystal 258 Chem, AOAC no. 011804), wherein at least 5-fold diluted sample solutions with a 1 259 wt% IL solution of [C5DMIM][OMs] were used. The average recovery rate of the 1 260 wt% ionic solution of [C5DMIM][OMs] was 97.5%. The recovery rate was calculated 261 using 200 ppm as 100%. 262 263 264\nStandard gluten (ppm) Extraction gliadin (ppm) Recovery (%)1\n1 200 196 98%\nglucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with L-glutamine and sodium 280 pyruvate (DMEM-HPA-P10, Capricorn Scientific) containing 10% fetal bovine serum 281 (FBS). N2a cells were seeded in six-well plates at a density of 2105 cells/well 282 overnight. Then the medium was replaced with test high-glucose DMEM medium 283 containing 0.1, 1, 2, 5, or 10 wt% [C5DMIM][OMs], and cells were incubated in an 284 incubator (37 \u00b0C, with a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere) for 6 h. The test medium 285 was removed, the cells were washed, and fresh high-glucose DMEM containing 10% 286 FBS was added and incubated for another 12 h. After that, cells were subjected to an 287 XTT test (X12223, purchased from Thermo Fisher) to determine the cell survival rate. 288 As shown in Fig. 7, survival rates of cells in the [C5DMIM][OMs] ionic 289 solutions at all concentrations were high than 97%. This indicates that the ionic 290 compounds in the present formulation had good biocompatibility. 291 292 Conclusions: 293 294 Wheat is a major food for humans globally, but around 1%~6% of people in the 295 world have wheat allergy issues. Gluten from wheat can induce an inflammatory 296 immune response in those patients. There are two major proteins of glutenin and 297\nprotein that induces the inflammatory immune response in patents. In food tests, 299 gluten detection needs a lot of time for pretreating samples because gliadin is water 300 insoluble. For this reason, we tried to synthesize an IL and applied it for rapid gluten 301 extraction. 302 In this report, we synthesized ILs with different lengths of side chains and 303 different anions of the imidazolium base IL to study the side chain and anion effects 304 of imidazolium ILs applied to dissolve gliadin, and we purchased a gluten/gliadin 305 ELISA kit to measure the extraction effect of imidazolium-based IL water solutions. 306 As to the side chain effect of the gliadin solubility test, the ILs of [HDMIM], 307 [TMIM], [C3DMIM], [C5DMIM], [C7DMIM], [C9DMIM], and [C12DMIM] with 308 OM anions were synthesized to study gliadin solubility with an imidazolium base of a 309 1% IL water solution, and we found that the 1% IL water solution produced good 310 gliadin solubility when the carbon chain was greater than 5 on imidazolium. In the 311 anion effect test, we synthesized [C5DMIM] with different anions (F, Cl, NO3, HSO4, 312 H2PO4, and OMs), and [C5DMIM] with OM anions produced the best gliadin 313 solubility. In the kinetic curve of gliadin solubility, [C5DMIM][OMs] could dissolve 314 more than 2500 ppm gliadin in 1 min and over 3000 ppm gliadin could be dissolved 315 in the IL water solution in 3 min. 316\nwithout [C5DMIM][OMs] by CD spectroscopy, and found that the spectra did not 318 significantly differ with or without [C5DMIM][OMs]. We measured the antibody-319 gliadin interaction by an ELISA after 1% [C5DMIM][OMs] extraction, and results 320 showed good linearity of different concentrations of gliadin with [C5DMIM][OMs]. It 321 showed that [C5DMIM][OMs] was not restricted by antibody binding with gliadin. In 322 the recovery test, the average of recovery rate was 97.5% from rice noodles with 323 gliadin added with 1% [C5DMIM][OMs]. 324 Generally, the toxicity of cells will increase when the number of side chains 325 increases. For this reason, we selected [C5DMIM][OMs] to test the cell toxicity, but 326 we found no significant cell toxicity from [C5DMIM][OMs] in the N2a model. Those 327 data showed that [C5DMIM][OMs] can be an extraction buffer for extracting gliadin 328 from food. This technology can increase the effect of detecting gliadin and reduce 329 organic solvents and multiple processes required to pretreat samples. It could be a 330 great development to protect celiac patients. 331\n332\nFigure 1. Gliadin solubility in the [C5DMIM][OMs] water solution. 333 334\n336\nFigure 2.
