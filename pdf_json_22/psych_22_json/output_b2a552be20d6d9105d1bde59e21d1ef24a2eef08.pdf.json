    "abstractText": "Background: Harmful use of alcohol is highly prevalent around the world and results in a large disease burden. Most people who meet the criteria for an alcohol use disorder do not receive treatment. Those in a person\u2019s social network can be useful in recognizing a problem and encouraging the person to seek treatment. However, many people lack the knowledge and skills to do this effectively. This study reports on the cultural adaptation for Brazil of the 2009 English-language mental health first aid guidelines for helping someone with problem drinking. Methods: A Delphi expert consensus study with two expert panels, one comprising health professionals with experience in the treatment of problem drinking and the other comprising people with lived experience was conducted. Participants rated the importance of actions to be taken to help a person with problem drinking. Results: Over two rounds, 60 participants (30 professionals and 30 people with lived experience) rated 197 items. A total of 166 items were included in the final guidelines. Conclusions: While there were many similarities with the English-language guidelines for high-income countries, the guidelines also incorporate actions of importance for Brazil, including compulsory treatment and different approaches to dealing with people with problem drinking. Further research is necessary to assess their impact.",

            "text": "Consumption of alcohol is a widespread phenomenon. In 2016, an estimated 55% of the world\u2019s population over 15 years old had consumed alcohol at some point in their lives, and 43% were current drinkers [1]. The global prevalence of heavy episodic drinking (HED) was 18.2%, with 39.5% of current drinkers engaging in HED. Also in 2016, harmful use of alcohol resulted in 5.3% of all deaths globally (which is higher than the mortality caused by diseases such as tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and diabetes) [1], as well as 4.3% of all DALYs worldwide [2]. Among Brazilian drinkers, the prevalence of HED was 48.1%, and the prevalence of HED in the total population was 19.4%, which is higher than the global average [1]. In 2015, approximately 1.5% of the Brazilian population could be considered to have alcohol dependency [3], while in 2011 the lifetime prevalence of alcohol abuse was 10.6% and lifetime dependence was 3.6% [4].\nDespite the high prevalence of drinking problems, most alcohol-dependent people do not seek professional help or participate in self-help groups, highlighting the need to develop alternative strategies to improve treatment rates [5]. Social networks may be useful in this process,\n*Correspondence: nreavley@unimelb.edu.au 3 Centre for Mental Health, Melbourne School of Population and Global Health, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria 3010, Australia Full list of author information is available at the end of the article\nas social pressure has been shown to be an important factor leading alcohol-dependent people to seek treatment [6\u20138], with studies suggesting that family members and friends have greater impact than trained professionals in increasing help seeking [9, 10]. However, in many cases, non-professionals may not recognize signs, may not know how to help or may offer ineffective help that differs greatly from expert recommendations [11].\nIn response to low levels of knowledge among the general community about how to assist someone developing a mental health problem or in a mental health crisis, the Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) course was developed to teach these skills [12]. Originating in Australia in 2000, the course has now spread to over 25 countries. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 18 controlled trials showed that MHFA training increased not only the amount of help provided to people with mental health problems, but also the knowledge of first aiders about effective treatments [13]. The MHFA course is based on expert consensus guidelines developed using the Delphi method, a technique that consists of submitting a series of statements to the evaluation and rating of experts to achieve an expert consensus [14\u201316]. It has been widely used in mental health research [17].\nWhile MHFA training has been widely disseminated, this has mostly been in high-income Western countries with well-resourced health systems [18]. The appropriateness of MHFA course content and implementation models in countries with major health system and cultural differences is unknown. In general, evidence in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) on how best to translate, adapt and scale-up population mental health interventions that have shown benefit in highincome countries is limited. A first step in this process is the development of guidelines for specific LMIC settings involving health professionals and people with lived experience from these settings.\nSeveral Delphi studies to develop mental health first aid guidelines for middle-income countries have been conducted [19\u201323]. Comparison of these guidelines with those from high-income countries showed that, while there was some broad agreement across experts from different countries, there were also some culturally specific actions [24]. In Brazil, for example, alcoholism is more commonly blamed on the person and seen as a \u201cweakness of character\u201d than in some high-income countries [25]. Furthermore, among Brazilian healthcare professionals, people with alcohol dependency in Brazil are seen as responsible for their own condition more often than those suffering from other mental disorders [26]. Therefore, the aim of this study is to adapt the mental health first aid guidelines for helping someone with problem drinking [16] to the Brazilian cultural and health\nsystem context, in order to improve the quality of helping actions taken by someone assisting a person with problem drinking."

            "text": "The aim of the study was to culturally adapt the mental health first aid guidelines for helping a person with problem drinking used in English-speaking countries. To our knowledge, this is the first study conducted in Brazil using a systematic process of cultural adaptation to improve supportive behaviours towards people with problem drinking.\nMany similarities between the Brazilian guidelines and the English-language guidelines were seen. The endorsement rate of initial statements included in the Round 1 questionnaire was high (84.2%, 149 out of 177 statements being endorsed), suggesting a high level of agreement. In the second phase, another 7 items from the English-language guidelines were endorsed resulting in 156 original items being endorsed (84.7%).\nWhile both the professional and lay panels opted to endorse statements in agreement with the guidelines of the English-speaking countries relating to taking a calmer, less forceful approach, including avoiding arguing with an intoxicated person, the lay panel rejected the statement pertaining to not labelling the person an \u2018alcoholic\u2019 or \u2018addict\u2019. This could suggest that although many Brazilians still see people with problem drinking as somehow guilty for their own condition [29], those that have personal experience with problem drinking or work as mental healthcare professionals have different perceptions. However, it should be noted that stigma towards individuals with mental disorders has not been as extensively studied in Brazil as in English-speaking (or other high-income) countries [30], and any conclusion might be premature.\nIn the second round, many statements about lowrisk drinking were rejected, mainly due to low levels of endorsement by the lived experience panel, several of whom came from Alcoholics Anonymous. This suggests that non-professional Brazilians that deal with harmful alcohol use or dependence are more reluctant to use a risk reduction strategy than those from English-speaking countries, while professionals consider it a valid approach. One participant from the lived experience panel stated: \u201cThere is no such thing as a use pattern that does not offer risks, therefore, I do not agree with lowrisk drinking\u201d. On the contrary, a participant from the professional panel suggested even more risk reduction strategy statements. In the first round, the statement If the person is unwilling to get professional help, because they don\u2019t want to stop drinking completely, the first aider should explain that the treatment goal may be to reduce alcohol consumption rather than to quit altogether was also rejected by the lived experience panel, corroborating the results of the second round. This shows that professional training and experience lead to the belief that alcohol can be consumed in a safe manner even by those with a history of problem drinking [31], a counter-intuitive thought that may not be disseminated among lay\u00a0 people. An advantage of the Delphi method for developing guidelines is that they consist of items that both those who favor risk reduction and those who favor abstinence can agree are essential or important.\nA number of statements about compulsory treatment were endorsed by the lived experience panel but rejected by the professional panel, such as The first aider should proceed with compulsory treatment if the person offers risk to herself or others and The first aider should try to convince the person to accept treatment even when the person does not believe they need an intervention. This implies that non-professionals are more likely than professionals to see compulsory treatment as a viable option, and to suggest treatment even when the person appears to be unwilling to undergo it, a situation that may reflect the controversies in involuntary treatment in psychiatry [32]. In Brazil, involuntary treatment has been the center of many discussions in the \u201cBrazilian Psychiatric Reform\u201d policy [33], possibly reducing its acceptance among professionals. Such items do not appear in the English version of the guidelines, showing greater acceptance of involuntary treatment among Brazilians, especially those who are not professionally trained."

A key strength relates to the inclusion of two different panels, one for professionals and another for people with lived experience, allowing for a greater range of views on alcohol use and development of actions that were acceptable not only to professionals, but also to those who have first-hand experience with problem drinking. Studies that incorporate the views of people with lived experience are less common in Brazil than in high-income countries and may play a role in building capacity in advocacy movements."

While there were many similarities with the Englishlanguage guidelines for high-income countries, the guidelines also incorporate actions of importance for Brazil, including the discussion about compulsory treatment, the promotion of alternative activities (e.g. sports and outdoors activities) to prevent drinking and a different approach for talking to the person about their drinking.\nThe guidelines may be disseminated as a stand-alone product or used as the basis for MHFA training in Brazil, thus helping to improve knowledge and helping behaviours of the public towards people with problem drinking. This may contribute to early intervention and better outcomes for people with problem drinking.
