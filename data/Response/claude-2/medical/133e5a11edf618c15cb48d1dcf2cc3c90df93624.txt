 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct a longitudinal study following MSM over time to examine actual risk compensation behaviors after receiving the HPV vaccine versus just intentions. 

2. Examine risk compensation intentions and behaviors in MSM who have already received the HPV vaccine to compare to the hypothetical intentions studied here.

3. Test interventions aimed at increasing self-efficacy of condom use and emphasizing negative outcomes of reducing condom use to see if they reduce risk compensation intentions and behaviors. 

4. Explore reasons for the positive outcome expectancy of increased intimacy/trust leading to risk compensation intentions and test interventions to address this.

5. Replicate the study in a probabilistic sample of MSM to improve generalizability of the findings to the broader MSM population.
