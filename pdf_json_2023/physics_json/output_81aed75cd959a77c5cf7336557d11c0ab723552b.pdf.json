    "abstractText": "The immobilization of proteins on nanoparticles has received much attention in recent years. Among different approaches, enzymatic protein immobilization shows unique advantages because of its site-specific connection. OaAEP1 is a recently engineered peptide ligase which can specifically recognize an N-terminal GL residue (NH2\u2013Gly\u2013Leu) and a C-terminal NGL amino acid residue (Asn\u2013Gly\u2013Leu\u2013COOH) and ligates them efficiently. Herein, we report OaAEP1-mediated protein immobilization on synthetic magnetic nanoparticles. Our work showed that OaAEP1 could mediate C-terminal site-specific protein immobilization on the amino-functionalized Fe3O4 nanoparticles. Our work demonstrates a new method for site-specific protein immobilization on nanoparticles.",

            "text": "Nanoparticle-protein complexes have a wide range of applications, such as magnetic separation of proteins [1,2], enzyme-catalyzed proteolysis [3], drug delivery [4], and disease diagnosis [5]. Thus, efficient immobilization of proteins on nanoparticles has received increasing interest in recent years [6\u201310]. Many interactions, such as electrostatic interaction and covalent binding, were used [11\u201313]. However, these methods suffer from the disadvantages of non-specific binding and uncontrolled orientation [14]. Recently, the enzyme-mediated method could realize N- or C-terminal site-specific protein immobilization on the nanoparticle, and many related works were reported [14,15]. In 2020, the Francis group reported that proteins containing proline, thiol, or aniline functional groups were coupled to phenols-functionalized Au nanoparticles by enzyme tyrosinase using an oxidative coupling reaction [16]. The enzyme sortase, one of the transpeptidases, has often been used for versatile enzymatic protein immobilization with the requirements of the two substrates with a C-terminal LPxTG tag and an N-terminal glycine repeat [1,17\u201323]. OaAEP1[C247A], cysteine 247 to alanine mutant of asparaginyl endopeptidedase 1 from Oldenlandia affinis, is a recently engineered protein ligase (abbreviated as OaAEP1). It recognizes an N-terminal GL residue (NH2\u2013Gly\u2013Leu) and a C-terminal NGL amino acid residue (Asn\u2013Gly\u2013Leu\u2013COOH) explicitly and ligates them efficiently. Thus, it is extensively used in protein/peptide ligation studies [24\u201331]. It is an excellent choice for protein immobilization, which has been well demonstrated for AFM-based single molecule-force spectroscopy (SMFS) studies of the immobilized protein [32\u201335]. In 2021, David J. Craik and Thomas Durek reported that the OaAEP1-catalyzed peptide and protein were irreversibly labeled with various nonpeptidyl amine nucleophiles at a C-terminal asparagine of the peptide and protein. In their work, the protein eGFP with NGL at the C terminal could conjugate with the molecules containing primary amine nucleophiles, which was demonstrated by SDS-PAGE and ESI-MS [36]. Similar work reported on asparaginyl endopeptidase-mediated protein C-terminal ligation with amino-containing molecules [27]. Moreover, the Ploegh group reported OaAEP1 catalyzed one-step protein\nMolecules 2023, 28, 379. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28010379 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 379 2 of 8\nmodification on the surface of red blood cells [37]. Thus, we believe that this powerful enzymatic ligation can be adopted for protein immobilization on nanoparticles, and thus we used this method to immobilize an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) with C-terminal NGL residues on the amino-functionalized magnetic nanoparticle, abbreviated as Fe3O4-NH2 nanoparticle (Scheme 1).

As illustrated in Figure 1D, the Fe3O4 nanoparticles were transferred from the organic phase to the aqueous phase, indicating the transformation from the hydrophobic Fe3O4\u2013OA to hydrophilic Fe3O4\u2013NH2. The changes in the average diameter of Fe3O4\u2013OA and Fe3O4\u2013NH2 measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) indicated that the modification of catechol\u2013 PEG5000\u2013NH2 on the Fe3O4 nanoparticle was successful (Figure S2). Besides, the TEM image (Figure 1E) of the product Fe3O4\u2013NH2 revealed that the Fe3O4\u2013NH2 nanoparticles were similar to the Fe3O4\u2013OA nanoparticles (Figure 1B). According to the amount of the nanoparticles and catechol\u2013PEG5000\u2013NH2, the amount of catechol\u2013PEG5000\u2013NH2 on the surface of 1 Fe3O4 nanoparticle was estimated as about 1200."
