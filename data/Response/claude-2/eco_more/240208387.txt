 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming:

1. Extend the analysis to allow for stochastic volatility or jumps in the price process of the risky asset. This would make the model more realistic but also more technically challenging.

2. Incorporate labor income as an additional source of wealth alongside investment returns. This would allow the model to capture life-cycle effects. 

3. Allow for multiple risky assets with correlated returns to study the optimal allocation across different asset classes. This could provide insights into diversification with transaction costs.

4. Analyze the effects of different trading strategies such as constant rebalancing instead of no-trade regions. This could reveal advantages of more dynamic trading approaches.

5. Develop numerical methods to solve the model for general parameter values. This could lead to practical tools for portfolio optimization with transaction costs.
