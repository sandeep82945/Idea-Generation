Exploration of Different Encapsulation Materials: Investigate the use of alternative biocompatible and biodegradable materials for encapsulating Monascus red pigments (MRPs) to compare their effectiveness in enhancing the stability and bioavailability of MRPs. This research could focus on natural polymers, proteins, or other lipid-based carriers besides liposomes to evaluate their potential benefits and limitations.

Application in Food Preservation: Given the study's findings on the stability and antimicrobial properties of MRPs, future research could explore the application of MRPLs in food preservation. This could involve testing the effectiveness of MRPLs as natural preservatives in various food products, assessing their impact on shelf life, taste, and nutritional quality, and comparing their performance against synthetic preservatives.

In Vivo Efficacy and Toxicity Studies: While the current study demonstrated in vitro anticancer activity and stability improvements, in vivo studies are crucial to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and bioavailability of MRPLs in animal models. Such research could provide valuable insights into the potential health benefits and risks associated with consuming MRPLs, paving the way for clinical trials.

Mechanistic Studies on Anticancer Activity: The study mentioned that MRPLs exhibit anticancer activity, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Future research could focus on elucidating the molecular mechanisms through which MRPLs exert their anticancer effects. This could involve studying the pathways involved in apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and inhibition of cancer cell proliferation and metastasis.

Development of Targeted Delivery Systems: Leveraging the findings on the stability and bioactivity of MRPLs, research could aim to develop targeted delivery systems for MRPLs to enhance their therapeutic potential. This could involve conjugating MRPLs with specific ligands or antibodies to target them to specific tissues, organs, or tumors, potentially improving the treatment outcomes for various diseases, including cancer.
