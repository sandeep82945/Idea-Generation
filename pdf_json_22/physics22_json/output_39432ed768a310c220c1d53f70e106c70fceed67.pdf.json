    "abstractText": "Similarly to their biological counterparts, suspensions of chemically-active autophoretic swimmers exhibit nontrivial dynamics involving self-organization processes as a result of inter-particle interactions. Using a kinetic model for a dilute suspension of autochemotactic Janus particles, we analyse the effect of a confined pressure-driven flow on these collective behaviours and the impact of chemotactic aggregation on the effective viscosity of the active fluid. Four dynamic regimes are identified when increasing the strength of the imposed pressure-driven flow, each associated with a different collective behaviour resulting from the competition of flowand chemically-induced reorientation of the swimmers together with the constraints of confinement. Interestingly, we observe that the effect of the pusher (resp. puller) hydrodynamic signature, which is known to reduce (resp. increase) the effective viscosity of a sheared suspension, is inverted upon the emergence of autochemotactic aggregation. Our results provide new insights on the role of collective dynamics in complex environments, which are relevant to synthetic as well as biological systems.",

Michelin1, \u2020\n1LadHyX, CNRS \u2013 Ecole Polytechnique, Institut Polytechnique de Paris, 91120 Palaiseau, France\nSimilarly to their biological counterparts, suspensions of chemically-active autophoretic swimmers exhibit nontrivial dynamics involving self-organization processes as a result of inter-particle interactions. Using a kinetic model for a dilute suspension of autochemotactic Janus particles, we analyse the effect of a confined pressure-driven flow on these collective behaviours and the impact of chemotactic aggregation on the effective viscosity of the active fluid. Four dynamic regimes are identified when increasing the strength of the imposed pressure-driven flow, each associated with a different collective behaviour resulting from the competition of flow- and chemically-induced reorientation of the swimmers together with the constraints of confinement. Interestingly, we observe that the effect of the pusher (resp. puller) hydrodynamic signature, which is known to reduce (resp. increase) the effective viscosity of a sheared suspension, is inverted upon the emergence of autochemotactic aggregation. Our results provide new insights on the role of collective dynamics in complex environments, which are relevant to synthetic as well as biological systems.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe dynamics of microscopic swimmers are dominated by viscous forces, and their self-propulsion can be achieved only by nonreciprocal fluid forcing [1]. Phoretic particles do so by means of interfacial forces that drive a thin boundary-layer flow near the surface of the particle [2]. At the typical scale of the colloidal particle, this layer\u2019s thickness is negligible so that the interfacial flow appears as a net slip velocity at the fluid-solid interface [3]. By forcing a relative motion of the fluid with respect to the particle, this effective slip velocity induces a net drift of the colloid [2, 4], as does the cilia-driven flows of many microorganisms [5, 6]. When interfacial forcing and drift result from local gradients of chemical concentration, it is referred to as diffusiophoresis [2], and as self-diffusiophoresis when such gradients are generated by the particle itself via surface chemical reactions. Janus colloids represent a now-canonical example of such phoretic colloids, and generate the gradients required for propulsion through the differential coatings of their two halves resulting in an asymmetric chemical activity [4, 7, 8].\nSelf-diffusiophoretic swimmers are chemically-active and actuate the fluid around them [3]; thus, they can interact via the chemical and hydrodynamic disturbances they induce on their environment [9\u201311], like many of their biological counterparts [12\u201314]. Within sufficiently large active suspensions, long-range chemical or hydrodynamic interactions can cause the emergence of collective dynamics [4, 15\u201317] characterised by correlated motion of the particles [18, 19]. Because it results from inter-particle interactions, the correlation length lc of such collective motion is intrinsic to the suspension and is typically larger than the interaction range [20], thus much larger than the typical size of the swimmers.\nA second important length scale within an active suspension is le which characterises its environment, and can be the typical size of regions with different background flow conditions or the degree of confinement (e.g. gap between obstacles, width of a channel or radius of a droplet hosting the suspension). When lc \u223c le, the collective behaviour of active systems is not suppressed but interestingly modified, as suggested by Ref. [21], who showed that the turbulentlike dynamics emerging in suspensions of E. Coli transition to collective directional motion when the system is confined within a sufficiently narrow and closed channel. Previously, Refs. [22] and [23] also showed how the collective motion of bacteria confined into a small droplet induced a steady single-vortex state due to the curvature of the boundaries.\nThe interaction of active self-propelled particles with rigid boundaries under confinement has an impact on the particles\u2019 motion even in the absence of intrinsic collective dynamics. In this regard, much research has focused on (steric or fluid-mediated) wall-particle interactions at the level of an individual swimmer in order to explain a variety of experimental observations. These include the attraction of swimmers toward walls and subsequent reorientation parallel to the surface [24, 25], their increased residence time near the surface [26], the orbits of rod-like autophoretic colloids around small obstacles [27], scattering dynamics of swimming microalgae off of circular pillars [28], and the influence of ciliary contact interactions with surfaces for flagellated microorganisms [29].\n\u2217Electronic address: traverso@ladhyx.polytechnique.fr \u2020Electronic address: sebastien.michelin@ladhyx.polytechnique.fr\nar X\niv :2\n20 4.\n11 49\n7v 1\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .s\nof t]\n2 5\nA pr\n2 02\n2\n2 Despite the complexities arising in the detailed description of each system, the tendency of swimming particles to spend most of their time near boundaries appears common to many active suspensions [30\u201332]. Interestingly, this behaviour can also be rationalized by involving only the combined effect of self-propulsion, steric exclusion by the wall and diffusive processes [33, 34]. Thus, at large time scales compared to those characterising the ballistic run of a swimmer, its shape and the specifics of its swimming kinematics are not necessary ingredients to predict a swimmer\u2019s larger residence time near walls.\nAnother key feature of natural environments is the presence of an external stimulus. This could be some nonuniform flow conditions, such as those generated by muscular contractions or heat convection in biological system [35] or by imposed pressure gradients in microfluidic devices [36]. Other stimuli include external attractive fields such as light for phototactic micro-algae [37] or synthetic swimmers [9]. In an experiment involving a confined suspension of phototactic algae, Ref. [38] tested the combined effect of two simultaneous stimuli: (i) a background pressure-driven shear flow and (ii) a directional source of light. The result is the focusing of the swimmers either at the centre of the channel or at the boundaries, depending on the relative directions of the flow and light source. A similar behaviour was observed by Ref. [39] for gyrotactic swimmers, where the effect of light is replaced by that of gravity. More recently, Ref. [40] showed how the presence of an externally-imposed pressure-driven flow affects fundamental microbial processes (e.g. nutrient uptake) by hampering chemotaxis while promoting surface attachment.\nAt the typical length scales of the suspension, the dynamics and trajectory of individual microswimmers are blurred and the system can be regarded as a continuum, namely as an active fluid. Active fluids are known to respond in a peculiar way to external stimulations. In particular, the rheology of active suspensions was analysed experimentally for elongated pusher-like [41, 42] and puller-like swimmers [43], which were found respectively to decrease and increase the effective viscosity of the fluid as a result of the energy injection at the particle scale. These predictions are qualitatively captured by theoretical models which consider the swimmers as elongated bodies and completely neglect the presence of boundaries [44, 45]. More complex models have included the effect of boundaries and inter-particle interactions in one-dimensional channels, i.e., considering inhomogeneities only along the cross-stream direction and an homogeneous streamwise direction [46]. However, the effective viscosity of an active suspension undergoing self-driven collective dynamics remains largely unexplored. Doing so would require (i) to account for spatial inhomogeneities also in the streamwise direction [i.e collective dynamics are minimally captured in two dimensions, see 12, 47], and (ii) to include hydrodynamic and chemical interactions, which drive the underlying self-organization processes.\nHaving identified confinement and external stimuli as building blocks to simulate a realistic environment of active suspensions [48, 49], the aim of this work is to study the collective response of autophoretic suspensions when placed into a channel pressure-driven flow, and how such response influences its macroscopic properties, e.g. the rheological properties of this active fluid. To this end, the kinetic model recently used by Ref. [50] to model autophoretic suspensions in a bulk environment is adapted here to include the effect of rigid no-slip walls and of an external flow.\nIn this work, we focus on suspensions of chemically-active Janus spheres whose surface properties enable their reorientation along gradients of a chemical solute produced at their surface thus making them auto-chemotactic, i.e. able to rotate and self-propel toward other particles or their chemical trails. At sufficiently large time scales compared to that of a ballistic swimmer\u2019s run, this effective attraction is known to promote particle self-organization in the form of asters [51], similar to that observed for autochemotactic microorganisms performing run-and-tumble dynamics [13, 52].\nOur first objective is to investigate how such chemically-driven astering process is influenced by the confined environment and particle-generated hydrodynamic field, for different intensities of the background pressure-driven flow. We then characterise the effect of such dynamics on the coherent hydrodynamic forcing exerted by the particles, and thus on the apparent viscosity of the active fluid. Finally, we derive and study the linear stability of a reducedorder model (ROM) to identify and capture the minimal physical ingredients to explain the rich collective behaviours in the numerical simulations of the complete model.\nBy accounting for both confinement and a background pressure-driven flow, thus reproducing conditions that are closer to the ones observed in practice, we predict and explain new dynamical regimes of autophoretic chemotactic suspensions and their link with the microscopic features of the particles. This represents a step forward in the design of control strategies for active suspensions, in order to accomplish medical tasks, such as drug delivery [53, 54] or noninvasive diagnostic tests for cancer cells [55], or to overcome environmental challenges, e.g. nuclear waste removal [56] or in situ bioremediation [57, 58], and to design active fluids with controllable rheological properties.\nThe manuscript is organized as follows: Sec. II introduces the kinetic model for the suspension dynamics under confinement, and the techniques employed for its numerical solution. Then, the system of equations is solved numerically for different strengths of the background flow in Sec. III, and four different regimes are identified, each displaying different dynamics emerging from the interplay between inter-particle interactions, confinement and background flow. Section IV discusses the effects of the active stresses induced by the particles on the particle-induced flows and the effective viscosity of the suspension. Section V proposes a reduced-order model for the suspension\u2019s dynamics and analyses its linear stability. Finally, Sec. VI summarizes the main conclusions of this analysis and presents further\n3\nperspectives."

On length scales much larger than the particle radius R, the probability to find a particle at a given position x with a set orientation p is described, at time t, by the distribution function \u03a8(x,p, t). Phoretic particles emit a chemical solute and generate a net fluid slip along their surface in response to local concentration gradients, so that on their surface\nDcr\u0302 \u00b7 \u2207C = \u2212A(r\u0302), u\u2217 = M(r\u0302)(I \u2212 r\u0302r\u0302) \u00b7\u2207xC (1)\nwith C(x, t) the local solute concentration and Dc its diffusivity, A(r\u0302) and M(r\u0302) are the (spatially-dependent) surface activity and mobility of the particle and r\u0302 the unit normal at the particle\u2019s surface.\nIn a three-dimensional space \u03a8 is a function of six independent variables, namely three spatial coordinates, two angles and time, making it unpractical for numerical time marching. In order to gain a relevant physical insight on the dynamics of the confined suspension and reduce the computational cost, we focus here on a two-dimensional case (all quantities are invariant in the x direction), counting four independent variables, namely two spatial coordinates x = (y, z), the orientation \u03b8 of the particles\u2019 director p = (cos \u03b8, sin \u03b8), and time t. Such 2D approximation is often made to solve continuum models describing active matter numerically, and it is consistently found to provide a qualitatively accurate description of the systems\u2019 dynamics [12, 17, 47, 52].\nThe evolution of the suspension then follows a Smoluchowski equation (expressing the conservation of the particles in space and orientation)\n\u2202\u03a8\n\u2202t = \u2212\u2207x \u00b7 (\u03a8x\u0307)\u2212\u2207p \u00b7 (\u03a8p\u0307), (2)\nwhere \u2207x denotes the spatial gradient. The operator \u2207p denotes the gradient operator with respect to the swimmers\u2019 orientation, and its application on a scalar field f(p) and a vector field a(p) amounts respectively to\n\u2207pf = \u2202f\n\u2202\u03b8 e\u03b8 and \u2207p \u00b7 a =\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03b8 (a \u00b7 e\u03b8), (3)\nwhere e\u03b8 is the unit vector defined as e\u03b8 = \u2202p/\u2202\u03b8 = (\u2212 sin \u03b8, cos \u03b8). The probability fluxes x\u0307 and p\u0307 in Eq. (2) are obtained from the deterministic velocities of an individual particle of orientation p located at x, in response to its own activity and to the hydrodynamic and phoretic mean fields, u(x, t) and C(x, t), generated by the outer flow and other particles in its vicinity. Those read\nx\u0307 = U0p + u + \u03c7t\u2207xC \u2212Dx\u2207x[ln(\u03a8)], (4)\np\u0307 = 1\n2 \u03c9 \u00d7 p + \u03c7r(p\u00d7\u2207xC)\u00d7 p\u2212Dp\u2207p[ln(\u03a8)], (5)\nwhere \u03c9 = \u2207x \u00d7 u is the vorticity vector. The translational and rotational velocities in Eqs. (4) and (5) are thus obtained by superimposing linearly (i) the intrinsic self-propulsion of the particles (there is no rotation for axisymmetric\n4 Janus particles), (ii) the hydrodynamic drift obtained from the hydrodynamic mean field using Faxen\u2019s laws, (iii) the chemical drift and rotation induced by a locally uniform gradient of concentration1, and (iv) the particles\u2019 diffusion.\nBecause we consider here the specific case of spherical half-coated JPs, the physico-chemical properties of the colloids\u2019 surface, namely their mobility M and activity A, are considered uniform on each hemisphere, respectively denoted (Af ,Mf ) in the front and (Ab,Mb) in the back. For brevity, we also define A\n\u00b1 = Ab \u00b1Af , the total activity (+) and activity contrast (\u2212), respectively, with similar definitions for the mobility. The particle self-propulsion and drift properties can be obtained explicitly in terms of these characteristics as [see Appendix A and 50]\nU0 = A\u2212M+\n8Dc , \u03c7t = \u2212\nM+\n2 , \u03c7r =\n9\n16\nM\u2212\nR \u00b7 (6)\nAt such microscopic scales, inertia plays a negligible role, so that the hydrodynamic problem is governed by the incompressible Stokes equations for the fluid\u2019s velocity u and pressure q, and is forced (i) by the hydrodynamic active stresses S(x, t) generated collectively by the JPs, and (ii) by an imposed pressure gradient along the streamwise direction fP = fyey. As a result,\n\u2207x \u00b7 u = 0, (7) \u2212\u03b7\u22072xu +\u2207xq = \u2207x \u00b7 S + fP , (8)\nwith \u03b7 the viscosity of the surrounding Newtonian fluid where the velocity field is subject to a no-slip boundary condition at the walls,\nu = 0 at z = \u00b1H. (9)\nFollowing Ref. [17], the active stress produced by the swimmers at a given location, S(x, t), is obtained by performing\norientational averages of the stresslet produced by a particle oriented along p, S\u0302(x,p, t), namely S(x, t) = \u3008S\u0302(x,p, t)\u3009, where \u3008\u2022\u3009 \u2261 \u222b S \u2022\u03a8dp. (10)\nAs for the particle\u2019s velocities, the stresslet associated with a phoretic particle can be computed from the mobility and activity distributions on its surface and can be decomposed into two different parts S\u0302 = S\u0302s + S\u0302e, namely (i) the self-induced stresslet S\u0302s corresponding to the phoretic response of the particle to its own activity, and (ii) the externally-induced stresslet S\u0302e corresponding to its phoretic response to an external solute gradient G [see Appendix A and 50]:\nS\u0302e = \u03b1\u0302e [Gp + pG + (G \u00b7 p)(pp\u2212 I)] , S\u0302s = \u03b1\u0302s ( pp\u2212 I\n3\n) , (11)\nwhere\n\u03b1\u0302s = \u2212 10\u03c0\u03ba\u03b7R2M\u2212A\u2212\nDc , \u03b1\u0302e =\n15\n8 \u03c0\u03b7R2M\u2212, (12)\nwith \u03ba = 0.0872 a numerical constant. Stresslets are traceless tensors; for the present two-dimensional implementation (where I : I = 2), the previous definitions must be adapted as\nS\u0302e = \u03b1\u0302e\n[ Gp + pG + (G \u00b7 p) ( pp\u2212 3I\n2\n)] , S\u0302s = \u03b1\u0302s ( pp\u2212 I\n2\n) . (13)\nAt the suspension scale, the chemical concentration field C(x, t) is governed by the advection-diffusion equation\n\u2202C\n\u2202t + u \u00b7\u2207xC = Dc\u22072xC \u2212 \u03b21C + 2\u03c0R2A+\u03a6 (14)\n1 Note that for a hemispheric Janus particle, the phoretic drift is purely along \u2207C, i.e. the component along p vanishes [59].\n5 which includes a relaxation term and a source term. The former is proportional to \u03b21, which should be interpreted as a measure of the finite-time intrinsic relaxation rate of the chemical system toward its background equilibrium, i.e., in the absence of or far from all active particles. Without loss of generality, the swimmers are considered net chemical sources (A+ > 0) and the source term is proportional to the local density of particles,\n\u03a6(x, t) = \u30081\u3009. (15)\nIn the dilute limit, we only need to account for the dominant influence of the particles at large distances, and thus neglect the subdominant contribution of the dipolar chemical field due to the anisotropic surface activity (A\u2212 6= 0). The walls of the channels are chemically-inert, therefore\n\u2202C \u2202z = 0 at z = \u00b1H. (16)\nFinally, particles can not penetrate the channel walls so that the normal component ez \u00b7 x\u0307 of the fluxes in Eq. (4) must vanish at the wall [34] providing the boundary condition on the distribution function \u03a8(\nU0 sin \u03b8 + \u03c7t \u2202C\n\u2202z\n) \u03a8 = dx \u2202\u03a8\n\u2202z at z = \u00b1H.

Convergence of the results was tested by performing simulations at increasing spectral resolution (up to Ny = Nz = 128, N\u03b8 = 32), and the values Ny = Nz = 64 and N\u03b8 = 32 are chosen to perform all the simulations reported here.\nThe time-dependent variables \u03a8 and C are marched in time using a semi-implicit Crank-Nicholson scheme in spectral space.

This requires to iterate the solution of the whole system of equations at each time step until convergence (typically three to five iterations per time step), an approach that was found to ensure fluctuations of the O(1) mean probability around its theoretical (conserved) value to be O(10\u22127) or less.\nThe initial particle distribution \u03a8(x,p, t0) = 1/(2\u03c0)+\u03b5\u03a8 \u2032(x,p) is generated by adding small random perturbations to a uniform and isotropic distribution \u03a8\u0304 = 1/(2\u03c0). The initial chemical concentration C(x, t0) is chosen as the purely diffusive steady state solution of Eq. (27) for the initial particle density considered, \u03a6(x, t0)."

We focus throughout the rest of the paper on the effect of the background flow intensity (\u03b3w) on an auto-chemotactic suspension. The value of the other parameters are chosen as follows.\nWithin such suspensions particles acting as net sources of solute are effectively attracted to each other due to the combined effect of positive chemical reorientation (\u03ber/\u03c1 = 1.25) and self-propulsion (u0 = 0.5). In addition, we consider in the following repulsive chemically-induced drift (\u03bet = \u22120.5) in order to isolate the effect of reorientation as chemical attraction. Setting \u03ber/\u03c1 and \u03bet of similar magnitudes as u0 results in the particles\u2019 passive drifts in a O(1) chemical gradient to be of the same order as their intrinsic propulsion speed; this reflects the theoretical expectation that collective dynamics develop when the motion due to inter-particle interactions is comparable with that due to self-propulsion [50]. These values correspond to dilute suspensions (O(10\u22122) volume fraction) of JPs of colloidal size (R \u223c 10\u22126m), and small solute molecules (Dc \u223c 10\u22129m2s\u22121). These estimates further result in the stresslet\n7 intensities \u03b1s = \u22120.7305 (pusher-type swimmer) and \u03b1e = 0.3927, see Eq. (25). For micron-sized spherical particles, typical rotational diffusion can be estimated using Einstein\u2019s relation, Dp = kBT/(8\u03c0\u03b7R\n3) \u223c 10\u22121m2s\u22121, yielding dp = DpH\n2/Dc = 0.25. For self-propelled colloids, their effective translational diffusion (i.e., at large time scales compared to the duration of a ballistic run) can be estimated by Dx = kBT/(6\u03c0\u03b7R) + U 2 0D \u22121 p /2 \u223c 10\u221211m2s\u22121 [7], giving dx = Dx/Dc = 0.025. Finally, the reduced chemical decay rate is set to \u03b2 = \u03c0/2, which yields a screening length for the chemical decay of the same order as the channel width. This choice allows particles to interact chemically across the entire channel."

            "text": "The overall dynamics of the anti-chemotactic suspension is summarized in figure 2 for increasing background flow \u03b3w. For all flow intensities, starting from the initial state (a small perturbation of an isotropic suspension) and after a short transient regime, the system rapidly approaches a one-dimensional (1D) fixed point of the system, where all fields are uniform in the streamwise (y) direction. Depending on the background flow intensity \u03b3w, this 1D-fixed point may however be either stable or unstable with respect to streamwise perturbations. Furthermore, for weak enough background flows (\u03b3w < 2.1) two families of fixed points coexist and may be observed: one is symmetric with the channel\u2019s centre line, while the other breaks the top-down symmetry of the problem. The selection of the intermediate 1D fixed point, and therefore the initial transient dynamics, are strongly dependent on the particular choice of initial conditions \u2013 the long-term dynamics of the system is however independent of these initial conditions and depends solely on the intensity of the background flow. The fact that these transient regimes are indeed 1D fixed point solutions was numerically checked by solving the 1D problem (i.e. setting \u2202/\u2202y = 0 achieved in practice by computing only one Fourier mode in the streamwise direction) and then marching the system to a steady state. We also remark that, the long term solution of the system is not affected by the initial conditions and depends solely on the intensity of the background flow \u03b3w.\nWhen the 1D fixed point is unstable with respect to streamwise perturbations, it appears only transiently, and, after a phase of exponential growth and saturation of the unstable modes, the solution converges toward a new y-dependent stable configuration, referred to in the following as long term solution. If, instead, the 1D equilibrium is stable with respect to streamwise perturbations, the system does not evolve away from it: the final state is stationary and uniform along the streamwise direction.\nThe nature of the final state depends on the background flow intensity: we thus propose a classification of the different regimes based on the properties of the long-term solution. In the following, we characterise symmetric and asymmetric regimes based on the symmetry (or absence thereof) of the long-term solution with respect to the centreline of the channel (y = 0). We also label these regimes as 1D or 2D, depending on whether the long-term solution is y-uniform (1D) or y-nonuniform (2D). As \u03b3w is increased progressively from zero, five regimes can be distinguished based on such features as qualitatively depicted in figure 2 (last column on the right):\n(a) No-flow regime (\u03b3w = 0): the symmetric and asymmetric 1D fixed points are both unstable and the final state is 2D and symmetric.\n(b) Weak-flow regime (0 \u2264 \u03b3w < 0.5): the symmetric and asymmetric 1D fixed points are both unstable and the final state is 2D and asymmetric.\n(c) Moderate flow regime (0.5 \u2264 \u03b3w < 2.1): the symmetric 1D fixed point is a transient state (unstable) and the system converges at long times to the asymmetric 1D equilibrium, which is stable.\n(d) Strong-flow regime (2.1 \u2264 \u03b3w < 4): only the symmetric 1D fixed point exists, and it is unstable; the final state is 2D and symmetric.\n(e) Flow-dominated regime (\u03b3w \u2265 4): the symmetric 1D fixed point is stable and coincides with the final state.\nIn the detailed discussion of each of these regimes, the dynamics of the suspension will be shown to result from the competition of chemical interactions between particles (autochemotaxis) and background flow reorientation. We thus anticipate that in regime (a) chemical reorientation of the particle (autochemotaxis) dominates, while in regime (e) the shear-induced reorientation and flow-induced drift of the particles will be dominant. Regimes (b), (c) and (d) result from a complex interplay between these effects. Note that the values of \u03b3w defining the boundaries between regions (a), (b), (c) and (d) are obtained by performing numerical time-marching simulations and are determined numerically with a typical uncertainty \u2206\u03b3w = \u00b10.1.\nThe present study focuses specifically on the effect of shear, comparing the dynamics resulting from the entire range of shear intensity \u03b3w. As a result, a fixed degree of confinement is considered throughout the analysis, F = 1. A detailed analysis of the effect of F is beyond the scope of the present study; nevertheless, preliminary results (unreported here) show that reducing the degree of confinement (F > 1) progressively weakens the wave-guide effects of the walls and is associated with a gradual transition towards bulk-like dynamics, F 1, where particle aggregates emerge far from the walls in the form of circular asters [50]."

            "text": "The initial dynamics of the suspension are characterised by a rapid relaxation toward the symmetric 1D equilibrium point; this relaxation typically occurs over a O(t\u03030) time, with t\u03030 = F/u0 the (non-dimensional) time taken by a particle to swim across the channel. Direct relaxation toward the asymmetric fixed point requires a marked top-bottom asymmetry of the initial condition. The characteristics of this asymmetric state are further discussed in Sec. III E.\nSimilarly to chemically-passive suspensions, and even in the absence of flow, the symmetric 1D fixed point is characterised by a wall-normal polarisation of the swimmers induced by the impenetrability of the boundary. The corresponding boundary condition on \u03a8, Eq. (22), induces a selection in the orientation of the self-propelled particles near the walls [34]. These wall-normal polarisation and accumulation can be understood rather intuitively: particles pointing away from a wall will progressively swim toward the opposite side of the channel, while particles oriented toward the boundary will remain trapped for a time proportional to the characteristic time scale of rotational diffusion.\nIn the absence of any flow and for a fixed channel width, the thickness of the resulting polarisation/accumulation\nboundary layer is inversely proportional to the self-propulsion velocity, and proportional to the swimmers\u2019 rotational and translational diffusion [34]. When a background shear flow is imposed, the local vorticity induces a rotation of the particles (Faxen\u2019s law) which is largest near the walls. In Poiseuille flow, this rotation results in upstream swimming and reduces the component of swimming toward the walls and consequent wall accumulation. These effects can be seen in figure 3 by noting ny < 0 and comparing the peaks of \u03a6 and nz at z = \u00b11 for increasing \u03b3w, respectively, where n is the local polarisation defined as\nn(x, t) = (ny, nz) = \u3008p\u3009, (28)\nwhose direction indicates the local expected orientation of the particles. For weak and moderate flows (\u03b3w < 2.1), however, the wall accumulation remains significant and consequently, the chemical concentration generated by the particles has a marked V-shape (figure 3). The associated chemical gradient induces the reorientation of the chemotactic JPs (\u03ber > 0) towards the upper (resp. lower) wall in the upper (resp. lower) half of the channel, i.e. nz > 0 (resp. nz < 0) even far from the boundaries, where the effect of confinement is still not markedly perceived. This results in the depletion of particles around the channel\u2019s axis (Figs. 3 and 4, top). It should be noted that this centerline depletion and reinforced wall accumulation here have a chemotactic origin and therefore differ from the shear-trapping mechanism observed for elongated swimmers [34, 40, 62, 63]."

If the orientation bias is in the direction of the source of the perturbation, i.e., another swimmer, then aggregates of swimmers can form. This type of collective behaviour is observed in suspensions of living microorganisms that react to chemical cues secreted by their counterparts by modifying their tumbling rate, resulting in their biased orientation at the time scale of the collective dynamics [12, 13]. Exploiting their front-back mobility contrast (M\u2212 > 0), the autophoretic JPs considered here reorient along the chemical gradient generated by other particles, which act as chemical sources (A+ > 0) [50, 64], see Eq. (21), resulting in similar collective dynamics.\nFigure 4 reports the particle density \u03a6(x, t) and chemical concentration C(x, t) at the onset of the instability of the symmetric 1D fixed point (top) and at large times (bottom) when no background flow is present (\u03b3w = 0). The y-uniform boundary layer along the walls starts to self-organize into aggregates of particles separated by relative depletion regions. This self-organization process stems from the autochemotactic nature of the swimmers (\u03ber > 0) which communicate chemically in the streamwise direction; this is already witnessed at the onset of the instability in the alignment of n with the local chemical field C, figure 4.\nAt large times the aggregation process saturates and aggregates of particles located near the same wall merge. The final state in figure 4 (bottom) results from the balance of (i) autochemotactic fluxes, (ii) wall-normal polarisation and accumulation, (iii) phoretic repulsion (\u03bet < 0) and (iv) translational/rotational diffusion of the particles.\nWe finally note the left-right symmetry of the final state, as there is no special direction along the y-axis in the absence of imposed flow.\n10"

Here again, both symmetric and asymmetric 1D fixed points are unstable and thus only observed transiently (figure 2b).\nAt early times, the transient dynamics are very similar to those found in the no-flow case, and the system\u2019s behaviour is nearly indistinguishable from that observed in figure 4 (top), a sign that for weak flow, the effect of chemical reorientation dominates the shear-induced rotation even in the high shear region near the walls. Yet, as discussed in Sec.III B, the presence of the background flow field reduces the wall normal polarisation and accumulation. This destabilises the symmetric solutions and, at later times (t = 510), we observe the onset of a symmetry breaking instability (figure 5, top). At the same time aggregates located on the same side of the channel begin to merge, as in the case with no flow. The final solution is characterised by an asymmetric 2D state (figure 5, bottom), which represents an intermediate configuration between the wall aggregates observed for no-flow, and the y-uniform asymmetric state which will be observed at higher \u03b3w and discussed in Sec. III E.\nThe flow-induced left-right asymmetry of the particles\u2019 aggregates is clearly visible in figure 5. When no flow is imposed, the horizontal polarisation, ny, is perfectly antisymmetric with respect to a vertical axis cutting through the centre of an aggregate (see figure 4). The y-uniform background vorticity breaks this antisymmetry in ny, and thus the left-right symmetry in \u03a6 and C.\nFinally, in contrast with \u03b3w = 0, the particles are also transported downstream by the background flow and, at large times, the solution is observed to be steady in a moving reference frame, and thus represents a travelling wave. The corresponding wave speed, which increases with \u03b3w, is neither the maximum nor the average flow speed but instead depends on the particle distribution within the channel."

            "text": "We now set \u03b3w = 1 to analyse the moderate flow regime (figure 2c). The solution first converges transiently to the (unstable) symmetric 1D fixed point as for weaker flows. In contrast with the previous regime, the most unstable mode is not two-dimensional but is instead asymmetric and uniform in the y-direction. At large times the solution\n11\nthus converges to the stable asymmetric 1D equilibrium (figure 6). Two boundary layers near the walls retain the features of the symmetric state (Sec. III B), namely a wall-normal polarisation (nz(\u22121) < 0 and nz(1) > 0) and a local increase in the particle density.\nIn this top-down symmetry-breaking instability, a small perturbation of the symmetric state leads to an increase of chemical production by the JPs on one side of the channel. Chemotactic swimmers then reorient in response to the chemical gradient by polarizing along the z-axis in the direction of the high concentration side thus amplifying the initial perturbation. The final asymmetric steady state is the result of the balance between the flux due to selfpropulsion, which can be visualized through the polarisation field pointing downward across most of the channel, and the upward flux due to phoretic repulsion (\u03bet < 0) induced by the chemical gradient (see nz and C in figure 6).\nThis mechanism does not involve the background flow and, consistently, the 1D asymmetric equilibrium is found also for \u03b3w = 0. The role of the flow, however, is to hinder the formation of wall aggregates thus stabilising the\n12\n1D asymmetric state. Physically, aggregates formation is triggered by chemical reorientation which can not act fast enough in comparison with vorticity-induced rotation near the walls, resulting in a misalignment of the polarisation vector with respect to the local chemical gradient.\nF. Strong imposed flow: fast moving patterns\nThe strong-flow regime is observed for flow intensities in the range 2.1 \u2264 \u03b3w < 4 (figure 2d). In that case, the 1D fixed point is characterised by a higher particle density near the centreline (figure 7): such particle trapping in the low-shear region of the channel was already observed in suspensions of nearly-spherical swimmers [40, 65]. From this unstable fixed point, particles self-organize in regularly-spaced aggregates around the centre of the channel, in a process analogous to the one experienced in the bulk [50], although it is more pronounced here in the centre of the channel, where the local background vorticity vanishes and therefore does not interfere with the chemical reorientation of the particles promoting such chemotactic instability.\nEventually the solution evolves toward a travelling wave characterised by alternating aggregation and depletion regions organised in a checkerboard pattern around the centreline and at the walls (see the particle distribution at t = 600 in figure 7): at a given location along the channel, depletion regions at the centreline correspond to\n13\naggregation at the walls, and vice versa. Such pattern moves at a speed close to the maximum imposed velocity of the background flow, UP (z = 0), indicating the driving of such moving patterns by the particle and solute organisation in the central low-shear region. This is in contrast with the travelling wave observed at lower shear (Sec.III D), where the dynamics are dominated by the particles\u2019 aggregates near the walls and the travelling wave moves at a much lower speed compared to the fluid velocity at the centreline.\nThe self-sustained existence of the moving patterns in figure 7 requires a mechanism that continuously drives particles away from depletion regions and towards accumulation regions at the centreline. Such mechanism can be explained in terms of the combined effects of autochemotaxis (chemical reorientation, \u03ber > 0), self-propulsion, background vorticity (hydrodynamic rotation) and confinement; its saturation is reached due to the effect of particle diffusion and phoretic repulsion (\u03bet < 0). These dynamics are better understood by considering the individual trajectories of particles leaving a centre-line depletion region along one of the three following directions: (i) antiparallel and (ii) parallel to the flow direction and (iii) towards the wall (figure 8).\nGiven the small local vorticity, particles (i) and (ii) are able reorient in the local chemical gradient (green circular arrows). Their trajectories remain in the fast-moving low-shear region leading towards the aggregation regions at the back and front of the depletion regions, respectively. Particle (iii) initially swims downward towards the slowmoving high-shear region, where the vorticity increases and the intensity of the flow gets weaker as UP (\u00b11) = 0. The orientation of the particle here is determined by the hydrodynamic clockwise rotation (white circular arrows) which is balanced by the chemically-induced rotation (green circular arrow). This mechanism, together with the fact that particles can not penetrate the wall, produces the high-density regions near the walls. Particle (iii) is now in the slow-moving region near the wall and, from the point of view of the moving patterns near the centreline, thus travels upstream (white dotted arrow). This relative motion brings particle (iii) in a position where the chemical reorientation induced by the centreline pattern and the background vorticity both act in the same direction, directing the particle back upward toward the moving high concentration region."

            "text": "A remarkable feature of the analysis presented in the previous section is that understanding the characteristics of the suspension dynamics didn\u2019t involve the flow forcing exerted by the particles. This suggests that hydrodynamic interactions between particles are subdominant with respect to the leading order effect of the vorticity-induced reorientation by the imposed flow or the chemical alignment of the particles with the local solute gradients.\nYet, during their swimming motion, phoretic particles exert stresses on the surrounding fluid, and generate a modified flow field within the suspension that can alter the overall fluid transport through the channel for a fixed forcing pressure gradient. In doing so, the phoretic particles modify the effective rheology of the active suspension. More specifically, using the linearity of Stokes equations, the volumetric flow rates associated with the background and particle-induced flows are defined as\nQ\u0307P = \u222b 1 \u22121 UP (z)dz, Q\u0307d(t) = ey \u00b7 \u222b 1 \u22121 ud(y \u2217, z, t)dz. (29)\nThe definition of Q\u0307d does not depend on the choice of \u2212A \u2264 y\u2217 \u2264 A due to the incompressibility of the fluid. The velocity ud = u\u2212 UP (z)ey is the particle-induced flow field, i.e. the flow velocity generated by the particles\u2019 forcing S in Eq. (24).\nIn the absence of particles, the classical Poiseuille law establishes that the driving pressure gradient is proportional to \u03b7Q\u0307P . Here, the pressure gradient driving the flow is fixed, so that the effective (modified) viscosity of the suspension is such that \u03b7Q\u0307P = \u03b7eff(Q\u0307P + Q\u0307d). In the following, we will characterise the rheology of the suspension through the evolution of the relative viscosity\n\u03b7r = \u03b7eff \u03b7 = 1 1 + Q\u0307d/Q\u0307P \u00b7 (30)\nFor a fixed background pressure forcing, the effective viscosity of the suspension will be smaller (larger) than the solvent\u2019s if the particle-induced flow reinforces (resp. opposes) the imposed flow rate. To understand and characterise this phenomenon, we now specifically analyse the particle-induced flow field ud in the different regimes identified in the previous section.\nAs detailed in appendix A and in Ref. [50], the particle-induced stress on the fluid has two origins: a self-induced contribution (Ss) corresponding to the slip distribution on the particle surface resulting from the concentration field\n14\ngenerated by the particle itself (i.e., its stresslet if it was isolated chemically and hydrodynamically), and a chemicallyinduced contribution corresponding to the slip induced on a particle surface by the chemical gradients generated by all the others (Se). Accordingly, following the decomposition S = Ss + Se, and exploiting the linearity of Stokes equations, the resulting particle-induced flow field and associated volumetric flow rate can also be split into two parts\nud(x, t) = us + ue, Q\u0307d = Q\u0307s + Q\u0307e. (31)\nBefore proceeding by examining the global relative viscosity \u03b7r, we remark that other approaches could be used. One is to look at local quantities by defining a particles\u2019 shear viscosity \u03b7p(x) which is the constant of proportionality between the active stresses and the strain rate of the fluid at a given location. In both approaches one needs the distribution function to be at least anisotropic for the model to predict any effect at all, i.e., to avoid the average active stresses to cancel out. Anisotropy of \u03a8 is not sufficient and, depending on the form of S, certain orientational moments needs be nonzero, e.g., \u3008pp\u3009 for Ss and \u3008p\u3009 for Se.\nIn suspensions of elongated microorganisms, for example, a nonzero average active stress can result from the preferred orientation of the swimmer in an imposed irrotational flow with constant rate-of-strain tensor E = (\u2207u + \u2207uT)/2 [45]. In contrast, no shear alignment occurs for spherical particles, therefore an external flow field is not sufficient to induce an anisotropic distribution. Here confinement introduces a first wall-normal preferential direction while the left-right symmetry is lost by imposing the background (rotational) flow and, finally, a nonzero active contribution to the total flow rate is predicted. As we will see, the y-component of the chemical gradient, which emerges when the solution is not uniform in the streamwise direction, locally introduces a new preferential direction with interesting consequences on the flow generated by the particles.\nIn the following, we analyse for each of the identified flow regimes in figure 2 the net flow rate generated by the particles. In the no-flow regime, the suspension\u2019s characteristics are left-right symmetric (there is no imposed flow direction breaking the symmetry): the net particle-induced volumetric flow rate is therefore trivially zero."

            "text": "We thus start by examining how the net flow rate is modified by the collective particle dynamics described in Sec. III D in the weak-flow regime (\u03b3w = 0.25). Figure 9 illustrates the temporal evolution of the particle-induced flow rate Q\u0307d and its two components, Q\u0307s and Q\u0307e. Three successive plateaus are identified which correspond to the different phases of the evolution of the suspension, and are illustrated by the corresponding contour plots of the particle density.\nShortly after the beginning of the simulation and up to t \u2248 230 the solution is in the symmetric 1D fixed point (figure 9a). During this phase, Q\u0307s/Q\u0307P > 0: the net flow rate is enhanced by the active self-induced particle stress. We note that the particles considered here are pushers (\u03b1s < 0), and this result is therefore consistent with the reduction in effective viscosity at low shear rate identified theoretically [44\u201346] and experimentally [41, 42] for suspensions of elongated pushers.\nIn contrast, Q\u0307e/Q\u0307P < 0: the externally-induced stress tends to hinder the background flow, increasing the effective viscosity. Some observations to explain this result are in order. For chemotactic particles \u03ber > 0 has two important consequences: (i) The sign of the externally-induced stresslet is positive, \u03b1e > 0, as both quantities depend on the mobility contrast M\u2212, see Eqs. (21) and (25); (ii) particles tend to be positively aligned with the local chemical gradient, G. Recalling the definition of Se, Eq. (11), the hydrodynamic signature of a particle directed along p and parallel to G is that of a puller swimmer oriented in the same direction. Clearly, the generated flow field will create a net flow in the opposite direction to the pusher-type self-induced flow (\u03b1s < 0). Such tendency of puller-like swimmers to increase the effective viscosity is in agreement with previous experimental [43, 66] and theoretical studies [44, 46].\nAt t \u2248 230, the instability of the 1D symmetric state can clearly be seen (figure 9b) before the solution eventually reaches its 2D final state (figure 9c and figure 5, bottom). Remarkably, during the transition from the 1D fixed\npoint (a), passing through (b), up until the final state (c) the components of the active flow rate, Q\u0307s and Q\u0307e, first decrease in magnitude and then change sign. This means that the chemically-induced polarisation and aggregation of the suspension (chemotactic instability) reverse the effect of each component of the active stress tensor on the\neffective viscosity: the pusher contribution now increases the viscosity (Q\u0307s < 0) while the puller-like contribution of the chemically-induced component reduces it (Q\u0307e > 0). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first prediction of a pusher and puller-like hydrodynamic signatures increasing and decreasing the effective viscosity, respectively, and results from the two-dimensional nature of the suspension organisation (in contrast with the purely one-dimensional settings considered usually). Note that the total particle-induced flow rate remains positive throughout the entire succession of dynamical phases outlined above, corresponding to a net reduction in effective viscosity in the weak-flow\n15\nregime. This indicates the dominance of the chemically-induced stresses in the long-term 2D dynamics, which were subdominant during the initial phase and whose intensity depends on the local particle polarisation and chemical gradients.\nThe detailed particle-induced flow ud observed at large times is reported on figure 10. For all flow intensities, the presence of aggregates at the walls induces counter-rotating vortices at the two sides of the aggregates which are reminiscent of those found in other confined active systems [21, 67]. With no imposed flow (figure 10a) all\nstreamlines are closed: no net flow is induced, i.e., Q\u0307d = 0. Upon increasing \u03b3w recirculation regions gradually disappear (figure 10b), and open streamlines are found as the background flow breaks the left-right symmetry in the particles distribution and Q\u0307d 6= 0."

Its two components, us and ue, are observed to respectively enhance and hinder the background flow (figure 11), which is consistent with experimental observations and theoretical predictions for active suspensions in parallel flows and the sign of the associated stresslet intensities, \u03b1s and \u03b1e. The effect on the suspension viscosity of pusher or puller swimmers does not depend on the symmetry property of the flow but are generic (i.e. they apply to both symmetric and asymmetric configurations).\nHowever, we note that Q\u0307s and Q\u0307e are both reduced in magnitude when the solution becomes asymmetric around t = 100 (figure 11, left). In the symmetric state, the local chemical gradient is always pointing towards the nearest wall and its relative orientation with respect to the (anti-symmetric) background vorticity is the same throughout the channel. This does not hold any more as the top-down symmetry is broken: in part of the upper half of the channel, the chemical gradient is pointing downward, which reduces both us and ui in that region, and moves their maxima in the region z < 0 (figure 11, right).\nFinally, unlike in the weak flow case, the self-induced component is now dominant and the overall effect is still to enhance the background flow and therefore to reduce the apparent viscosity of the active fluid, as can be seen from the positive sign of Q\u0307d in figure 11."

V where ud is neglected), the effect of the particle-induced flow on the suspension\u2019s organisation is qualitatively negligible. However, ud impacts significantly the long-term effective viscosity \u03b7r, whose variations with \u03b3w are displayed on figure 13, together with that obtained by accounting exclusively for self-induced stresses (\u03b7r,s) or externally-induced ones (\u03b7r,e). Note that these do not contribute additively to \u03b7r, see Eq. (30).\nAbove a certain flow strength (here \u03b3w \u2248 3) \u03b7r \u2248 1, showing that the particle\u2019s hydrodynamic forcing is negligible and the background shear stress dominates. In this regime, the passive stress due to the inextensibility of the particles (which is not considered here) is also expected to be important and to increase the effective viscosity for pusher and puller suspensions regardless of the particles\u2019 shape [42, 43, 46, 66, 68].\nWe therefore focus our attention on the active contributions to the effective viscosity at lower flow strengths, namely in regions (b) and (c) of figure 13. In region (c), the puller-like contribution to the viscosity, \u03b7r,e, contributes positively to \u03b7r resulting into a decrease of \u03b7r,e with \u03b3w (shear-thinning region), in line with previous studies on pullers [43, 46]. The trend is reversed in region (b), for weak flows. Here, starting at \u03b3w = 0.1, \u03b7r,e increases with \u03b3w resulting in a shear-thickening region. This behaviour is associated with 2D dynamics of the suspension and linked to the local appearance of a new preferential direction (other than the wall normal direction and the flow direction), represented by the chemical gradient. The same behaviour, in a specular way, occurs to the pusher contribution, \u03b7r,s, which goes from promoting shear-thinning at weak flows, region (b), to promoting shear-thickening at intermediate flows, region (c).\nThe overall contribution \u03b7r is always negative but the shape of the curve \u03b7r(\u03b3w) might qualitatively change depending on the relative magnitude of the two opposite contributions, \u03b7r,s and \u03b7r,e. The sign of \u03b7r,s and \u03b7r,e, instead, depends on the relative importance between chemical reorientation and rotation by the flow, which always varies smoothly from flow-dominated to chemically-dominated below some non-vanishing value of \u03b3w. For this reason the shape of the curves of \u03b7r,s and \u03b7r,e against \u03b3w are expected to be robust, at least qualitatively, representing one of the main contributions of this work.\nFinally we stress the generality of the present results, beyond the particular case of Janus phoretic particles: the sign reversal of the puller and pusher footprints on the viscosity is indeed relevant to all suspensions of microswimmers prone to exhibit chemotactic dynamics even if characterised by only one hydrodynamic signature. In other words, the curves of \u03b7r,s and \u03b7r,e in figure 13 can be seen as independent (qualitative) prediction of \u03b7r for suspensions of autochemotactic pusher and puller microorganisms, respectively.\n18"

(32)\nThe evolution equations for the first two moment intensities, \u03a6 and n = (ny, nz), are obtained by taking the first two orientational moments of the Smoluchowski equation (2). Understanding the dynamics discussed in Sec.

(33)-(35) together with Eq. (27) and (16) for the chemical concentration form a closed system of partial differential equations, referred to in the following as the two-moment system or reduced model. Using Eq. (32) to derive the\n19\nsystem (33)-(35) from Eq. (2) implies approximating the next (second) orientational moment as\nD(x, t) = \u3008pp\u2212 I 2 \u3009 \u2248 \u03a6I 2 . (36)\nSimilar closure schemes based on a truncated expansion on the basis of spherical harmonics are commonly used for analysis or simulations of active suspensions [34, 46, 69\u201372]. The truncation point though is commonly at the third mode (second moment) or after, which is necessary to compute the self-induced active stress as Ss \u223c D. Moreover, D is also required to study the evolution of the orientational distribution of elongated particles through Jeffrey\u2019s equation. Including the second moment is therefore necessary, for example, to study the hydrodynamic instability emerging in suspensions of elongated pushers [72] or the rheological properties of active suspensions under externally-imposed flow [44, 45].\nIn contrast, for a chemotactic suspension of spherical autophoretic swimmers, the leading order interaction routes of the particles with each other and with the background flow are captured already at the polarisation level. Indeed, in our dilute model the chemical field generated by the swimmers is a function of \u03a6 only, see Eq. (27). Similarly the translational drift induced by the chemical gradient, \u03bet\u2207xC, and that induced by the flow field through Faxen\u2019s law do not depend on the particle\u2019s orientation and therefore influence the evolution of the particle density regardless of the local polarisation, see Eq. (33). The self-propulsion velocity, u0p, as well as the vorticity- and chemically-induced rotations, 12\u03c9 \u00d7 p and \u03ber \u03c1 (p \u00d7 \u2207xC) \u00d7 p, depend on the particle\u2019s orientation and therefore the first orientational moment needs to be included to capture their effects. In turn, these terms associated with the rotational motion of the particles, which naturally are present in the equations for n, Eq. (34), enter the equation for the particle density \u03a6 only in the presence of self-propulsion and with non-zero polarisation density n (see the first term on the right-hand side of Eq. (33)). To conclude, by using Eqs. (32) and (36) we can account for the leading order particle interactions discussed in Sec. III in a minimal way.\nB. 1D equilibria of the two-moment system\nWe first analyse the existence of steady 1D (i.e. y-invariant) solutions by marching in time the 1D version of the reduced model described above (i.e considering \u2202/\u2202y = 0 for all the solution components) until a steady state is reached. Remarkably, we find that one symmetric and one asymmetric steady states coexist when the background flow is weak enough (\u03b3w < 1.9), in agreement with the numerical simulations of the full model which predicted the coexistence of these states for \u03b3w < 2.1. Furthermore, the comparison of Figs. 14 and 6 shows that the asymmetric 1D fixed point of the reduced model retains the qualitative features of its counterpart in the full model, in particular the establishment of a nearly uniform wall-normal chemical gradient and particle polarisation across most of the channel width, that drive two competing effects, namely a chemotactic migration toward the chemically-rich wall and a phoretic drift toward the chemically-depleted one, the former effect being dominant."

(37)\n20\nAfter linearizing the two-moment system in the limit of small , we seek solutions of the form \u03a6\u2032(y, z, t) = \u03a6\u0303(z, k)e(iky+\u03c3t) and analogously for n\u2032 and C \u2032.

(38)\nThe linear stability of the model thus finally reduces to an eigenvalue problem of the form\n\u03c3x\u0303 = Lx\u0303, (39)\nwith L the linear operator accounting for the discretised linear reduced model modified adequately to account for the boundary conditions. This system is then solved numerically using a Matlab\u2019s algorithm based on the principle of minimized iterations [73]. Figure 15 reports the growth rate \u03c3M = Re(\u03c3) of the most unstable mode as a function of the strength of the imposed flow, measured by \u03b3w. We emphasize that the base state considered is different for each value of \u03b3w, and for \u03b3w < 1.9, different symbols are used for the modes related to symmetric and asymmetric base states.\nIn agreement with the full numerical simulations, the stability analysis shows the presence of unstable modes until \u03b3w \u2248 4, above which the y-uniform solution is stabilised under the effect of strong background flow. For 1.7 < \u03b3w < 2.4, the most unstable mode associated with the symmetric base state is characterised by denser regions near the walls (see figure 15, inset (2)), which resemble the unstable modes observed during the transient dynamics of the full simulations for \u03b3w < 1.5 (shown only for \u03b3w = 0 in figure 4, top). The dominant mode for \u03b3w & 2.4 (figure 15, inset (3)) closely resembles the moving patterns described in figure 7 (bottom).\nThe eigenvalues associated with these two families of modes have a nonzero imaginary part Im(\u03c3) = \u03c3I that grows linearly with \u03b3w, which is consistent with a wave solution travelling in the streamwise direction with speed c proportional to the background flow. More precisely, c can be estimated from the stability analysis of the reduced model as\nc = (\u03c3I\n2\u03c0 )( 2\u03c0 kM ) , (40)\nwhere 2\u03c0/kM is the wavelength of the most unstable mode. This estimate of c is in agreement with the actual wave speed measured in full simulations in the strong flow regime, i.e., fast moving patterns equivalent to modes (3) in the reduced model, as plotted in figure 15 (bottom). The wave speed associated with modes (2), similar to the wall patterns observed in the full numerical simulation, is significantly smaller than that of modes (3) which is also consistent with the full simulations.\nFocusing on the range of flow rates 1.7 < \u03b3w < 1.9 in figure 15 (top), two observations can be made. First, an unstable branch of asymmetric modes uniform in y (i.e. 1D modes) is present at low flow rates, modes (1), and is more unstable at low flow rates than the wall patterns, modes (2). Branch (1) assesses the stability of the symmetric 1D fixed point to 1D perturbations and is consistent with the observations of the full numerical simulations (see figure 2): it confirms the existence of an intrinsic instability of symmetric configurations for sufficiently weak flows, as reported in Secs. III D and III E.\nAlso, a branch of unstable 2D modes relative to the asymmetric base states (open circles) tend towards negative growth rates as \u03b3w decreases, suggesting the existence of a stable region of the asymmetric base state, qualitatively corresponding to the intermediate flow regime, line (c) in figure 2.\nFinally, for background flows weaker than \u03b3w < 1.7, solving the two-moment system leads to solutions with negative particle density, and therefore loses physical meaning. This is not surprising as the reduced model, which is based on a truncated two-mode expansion of the full distribution function, loses the properties built-in the structure of the original conservation Eq. (2).\nThe reduced model and its stability analysis are therefore in qualitative agreement with the complete model, indicating that the diverse collective dynamics observed can be rationalised without accounting for hydrodynamic interactions between particles, and using a very simplified representation of the probability distribution, in particular regarding the orientation characteristics, simply described here by the local polarisation vector n(x, t). This is quite different from the representation of collective dynamics in bulk quiescent flows [50], suggesting that a transition towards bulk-like dynamics will take place by increasing the ratio between the channel width and the intrinsic length scale of the suspension, F , which is confirmed by unreported preliminary results and shall be one aspect of future investigations.\n21"

            "text": "This work proposes an in-depth investigation into the self-organization dynamics of a dilute autochemotactic phoretic suspension under the combined effects of confinement inside a channel and of a pressure-driven shear flow. It also offers an analysis of the effect of the particles\u2019 hydrodynamic forcing on the resulting total flow rate for fixed pressure forcing, i.e. a measure of the effective viscosity of the active fluid. As the background flow intensity is increased, our results show a smooth transition from a weak flow regime, where the particles self-organise into spatio-temporal patterns, to a flow-dominated regime, where chemical interactions between particles are subdominant with respect to the transport and rotation by the imposed background flow that drives their individual and collective dynamics. Starting from an initial perturbation of the isotropic suspension configuration, confined autophoretic suspensions quickly organize across the channel width leading to the emergence of 1D (i.e., stream-wise uniform) equilibria distributions associated with a top-down (i.e., cross-stream) symmetry-breaking. When these 1D configurations are unstable to streamwise perturbations due to chemical interactions among particles, the final long-term particle organization is inhomogeneous along the axis of the channel, and characterised by either wall aggregates or fast moving patterns, depending on the intensity of the background flow.\nThe impact of the suspension\u2019s dynamics on the fluid\u2019s effective rheology (defined as the modification of the total flow rate for a fixed pressure forcing) was further examined in two distinct ways. The first one focused on the fluid\u2019s response to quasi-static variations of the external forcing (i.e. over time scales much larger than that of the intrinsic dynamics, see figure 13). Our results show that the collective organisation of the autochemotactic phoretic suspensions considered here tend to reduce its effective viscosity, particularly in the regime of lower flow forcing. Yet, the detailed analysis of the self-induced and externally-induced contributions to the particle-induced flow, shows a complex evolution of these two parts, respectively associated with the particle self-propulsion and its response to the chemical gradients generated by other particles. They are observed to contribute to the total flow rate in opposite direction to each other, but also reverse the sign of their individual contribution as the flow rate is gradually increased, as a result of the fundamentally-different organization of the particles in each regime. These observations demonstrate how inter-particle interactions and the consequent collective dynamics strongly influence the effective rheology of active fluids, which is an aspect vastly unexplored in the literature so far, with many potential engineering applications.\nFor a given flow intensity, we also analysed the rheology of active suspensions by characterising the evolution of the particle-induced flow rate as the collective organisation of the particles evolve in time (see figures 9, 11 and 12). Our results suggest the possibility to control in real time the viscosity of an active fluid via the particles\u2019 collective dynamics. These can indeed be controlled, for example, by means of external chemical [74\u201376] or optical [9, 37]\n22\nsignals, thus paving the way for new microfluidic applications involving either synthetic or biological microswimmers. The particular configuration chosen for our study (i.e. a pressure-driven channel shear flow) exposes the particles to a non-uniform shear, and as a result, our characterisation of the fluid\u2019s rheology is phenomenological and macroscopic, although motivated by many technological applications which may be interested in reducing (or increasing) the flow rate in a thin channel for fixed pressure drop. Several of the self-organisation features identified here are directly linked to the non-uniformity of the shear and may not hold in other settings. An alternative approach to the characterisation of the suspension\u2019s rheology consists in analysing its response to a uniform shear rate (as in most rheometers).\nThe shape of the particles substantially affects their response to the hydrodynamic field; as a result, a potential extension of the present work would consider suspensions of anisotropic (e.g. rod-like) particles for which hydrodynamic reorientation in shear plays a significant in the organisation of the suspension and the particle-induced flow.\nWe finally remark that our results are obtained in the dilute limit where far-field interactions are dominant. However, the control of the fluid\u2019s properties for technological applications would likely require to maximize the hydrodynamic forcing by the particles, which might naturally call for denser suspensions. In this case, the near-field steric, chemical and hydrodynamic interactions (among particles and with the boundaries) will also play an important role, and particle-based approaches [e.g., 77, 78] may become more relevant despite their substantially higher computational cost."

Because of the presence of the particle, the external field is modified in its vicinity as\nCe = C\u221e + G \u00b7 r ( 1 + R3\n2r3\n) . (A9)\nSubstitution of this result into Eq. (A2), provides the externally-imposed slip velocity, u\u2217e, and substitution into Eq. (A1) provides the translational and rotational drifts experienced by the force- and torque-free particle, respectively, as\nUe = \u03c7tG, with \u03c7t = \u2212 M+\n2 , (A10)\n\u2126e = \u03c7rp\u00d7G, with \u03c7r = 9\n16\nM\u2212\nR \u00b7 (A11)\nNote that the translational drift Ue does not include any component along (G \u00b7 p)p in contrast with more generic particles [59], since the second Legendre projection M2 of the mobility distribution vanishes for hemispherically-coated particles.\nSimilarly, the stresslet component due to the external gradient is obtained from Eq. (A1) as\nS\u0302e = \u2212 15\u03b7\n4 \u222b \u2202V M(r\u0302) { [(I \u2212 r\u0302r\u0302) \u00b7G] r\u0302 + r\u0302 [(I \u2212 r\u0302r\u0302) \u00b7G] } dA. (A12)\nFor piecewise uniform mobility distribution on each hemisphere, the integral in Eq. (A12) can be conveniently rewritten as the sum of two contribution, on the front (r\u0302 \u00b7 p > 0) and back hemispheres (r\u0302 \u00b7 p < 0). Using\u222b\nr\u0302\u00b7p>0 r\u0302 dA = \u03c0R2p,\n\u222b r\u0302\u00b7p>0 r\u0302r\u0302r\u0302 dA = \u03c0R2p 4 [ pI + Ip + (Ip)T23 ] (A13)\nwhere AT23 is the transpose of the third-order tensor A with respect to its last two indices (the integrals on r\u0302 \u00b7p < 0 are obtained by changing p into \u2212p), the induced stresslet is finally obtained as\nS\u0302e = \u03b1\u0302e [Gp + pG + (G \u00b7 p)(pp\u2212 I)] , with \u03b1\u0302e = 15\n8 \u03b7R2\u03c0M\u2212.
