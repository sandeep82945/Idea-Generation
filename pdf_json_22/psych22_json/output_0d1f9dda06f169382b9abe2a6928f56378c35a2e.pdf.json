            "text": "Every day we constantly observe other people receiving rewards. Theoretical accounts posit that 39 vicarious reward processing might be linked to people\u2019s sensitivity to internal body states 40 (interoception) and facilitates a tendency to act prosocially. However, the neural processes underlying 41 the links between vicarious reward processing, interoception and prosocial behaviour are poorly 42 understood. Previous research has linked vicarious reward processing to the anterior cingulate gyrus 43 (ACCg) and the anterior insula (AI). Can we predict someone\u2019s propensity to be prosocial or to be 44 aware of interoceptive signals from variability in how the ACCg and AI process rewards? Here, 45 participants monitored rewards being delivered to themselves or a stranger during functional magnetic 46 resonance imaging. Later, they performed a task measuring their willingness to exert effort to obtain 47 rewards for others, and a task measuring their propensity to be aware and use interoceptive signals. 48 Using multivariate similarity analysis, we show that people\u2019s willingness to be prosocial is predicted by 49 greater similarity between self and other representations in the ACCg. Moreover, greater dissimilarity 50 in self-other representations in the AI is linked to interoceptive propensity. These findings highlight 51 that vicarious reward is linked to bodily signals in AI, and foster prosocial tendencies through the 52 ACCg. 53\n54\n55\nIntroduction 56\nFrom seeing strangers enjoy delicious-looking meals in restaurants, to observing likes on 57 social media posts, witnessing other people receive rewards is a fundamental feature of our social 58 lives. Theories suggest that the vicarious processing of these rewards is a key component of social 59 behaviour (1, 2). More strongly representing others\u2019 rewards may allow people to share others\u2019 60 positive experiences and lead to stronger visceral responses (2\u20137), as well as it may lead us to 61 choose to exert effort into prosocial acts aimed at obtaining positive outcomes for them (8\u201312). As 62 such, representing other people\u2019s outcomes may be linked to the propensity to be aware of internal 63 bodily signals that influences our social behaviour. However, largely, such accounts have not been 64 empirically tested. Although some previous studies have linked vicarious reward processing to 65 prosocial behaviour (13\u201315), and variability in interoception to the processing of social information (5\u201366 7, 16, 17), it is unclear whether it is the vicarious representation of others' rewards that is linked to 67 interoception and prosocial behaviour, or some other aspect of the tasks that are used to probe them 68 (e.g. the desire to help). As a result, the neural mechanisms that relate either interoception or 69 prosocial behaviour to vicarious reward signals remain poorly understood. 70\nResearch examining self and vicarious reward processing has implicated two regions of the 71 brain as consistently responding to self and other rewards - the gyral portion of the anterior cingulate 72 cortex (ACCg) and the anterior insula (AI) (2, 18\u201321). These specific portions of the cingulate and the 73 insular cortices have been also largely associated with vicarious processing and social stimuli in 74 general, suggesting a specialised function in socially-relevant stimuli, which contrasts with other 75 portions of these regions (e.g. ACC sulcus, posterior insula) more focused on processing self events 76 (2, 18, 29\u201331, 21\u201328). Importantly, among these functions, these two regions are engaged when we 77 see cues indicating other people will receive a reward, respond differently when people receive a 78 reward themselves, and do not respond to foregone rewards delivered neither to self or other (2, 21). 79 Strikingly, separate lines of research also implicate these same regions in interoceptive processes 80 and to prosocial behaviour (15, 25, 32\u201334). As a result, theoretical accounts suggests that reward 81 processing, interoception and motivation may be intimately linked (35\u201337). However, it is unclear 82 whether vicarious reward processing in the ACCg and AI are linked separately to these different 83 functions. 84\nIndeed, research has suggested that despite both the ACCg and AI being engaged when 85 seeing others\u2019 rewards, the processing in each region may serve different functional roles. Broadly 86 speaking, the insula is engaged in processing the links between information about rewards and bodily 87 states, while ACC may be more strongly linked to driving the motivation to obtain rewarding outcomes 88 (36\u201345). AI has been proposed as key in processing interoceptive signal, self-awareness and body 89 ownership, which might be crucial to disentangle vicarious from self outcomes (34, 38, 46). On the 90 other hand, ACCg has been involved in prosocial motivation and vicarious processes, with some 91 studies reporting specific responses for social stimuli, while others showing general activity for self 92 and other (2, 18, 21\u201326, 47, 48). However, as most tasks used to examine the neural processes 93 underlying prosocial behaviour involve self and other rewards, and also may evoke interoceptive 94\nprocesses, it has been difficult to disentangle whether vicarious processing in the ACCg and AI is 95 associated with distinct functions, and how specific or general these roles are for self and vicarious 96 processes. We propose one solution to this problem is to examine whether neural responses to 97 others\u2019 rewards in the ACCg and AI when simply passively observing them are linked to either 98 individual differences in people\u2019s willingness to be prosocial, or their propensity to be aware of 99\ninteroceptive signals, in separate tasks. 100\nHow can we interpret neural responses to others\u2019 rewards? While a number of studies have 101 examined vicarious reward processing with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), there are 102 contrasting viewpoints on how vicarious reward BOLD signals should be interpreted (1, 2, 25, 47). On 103 the one hand, the overlap between clusters that respond to self and other rewards in the ACC and AI 104 is often interpreted as being indicative of a \u2018common currency\u2019 that represents information about both 105 ourselves and other people in the same manner (1, 49). Thus, it is assumed that this neural overlap 106 could be indicative of a similar positive affective response at another receiving rewards to rewards 107 being received by oneself. In contrast, other studies have shown that greater specialisation \u2013 more 108 distinct processing between self and other rewards \u2013 is linked to higher levels of empathy and higher 109 learning speed for prosocial actions (20, 50). Such greater specialisation, rather than a common 110 currency, might therefore underlie stronger prosocial tendencies (20, 47, 50). However, only a few 111 studies have examined variability in vicarious reward processing between people, with the majority of 112 them using univariate fMRI analysis, where the strength of activity in a certain brain location is 113 correlated between self and other conditions. Even though these studies have provided valuable 114 evidence to support either perspective on this dispute, there is an inherent limitation of this approach - 115 similar strength in univariate BOLD signal does not necessarily imply similar multivariate patterns of 116 responses for self and other rewards. Therefore, even in the presence of neural overlap between self 117 and other rewards in some individuals, there could be a different pattern of response for each 118 condition within a brain area, suggesting distinctive processing. Crucially, analysis techniques that 119 can formally test the similarity between self and other reward representations, such as multivariate 120 pattern analysis, have rarely been employed in previous studies, and typically without paying attention 121 to individual differences. 122\nHere, we use a multivariate approach to test whether similarity in neural responses to self and 123 other reward in the AI and ACCg is linked to people\u2019s propensity to be aware and use interoceptive 124 signals and their willingness to exert effort into prosocial behaviours. Participants performed three 125 tasks (Fig. 1), the first while undergoing fMRI and the second two in a separate behaviour session. 126 Participants (n = 61) first underwent fMRI during a value representation task, in which they observed 127 cues indicating that rewards were being accrued \u2013 or being taken away \u2013 from oneself or from an 128 anonymous other person. In addition, they performed two behavioural tasks without fMRI. First, an 129 interoceptive respiratory task, which measured people\u2019s propensity to be aware and use internal, 130 rather than external, signals to judge their respiratory output (51). Second, a prosocial effort task (8), 131 which measured willingness to exert physical effort to obtain rewards for oneself or for an anonymous 132 stranger (8, 10, 48, 52). These two tasks enable measurement of individual differences in reliance on 133\ninteroceptive cues and prosocial motivation. To examine whether the distinctiveness of self and other 134 reward representations in ACCg and AI is linked to prosocial motivation and interoception 135 respectively, offline task behaviour was correlated with pattern similarity in each region from the value 136 representation task (53). 137\nWe find that prosocial motivation and reliance on interoceptive signals are linked. The more 138 strongly guided by internal signals someone is, the more incentivised they are to obtain rewards for 139 another person. Strikingly, people\u2019s levels of prosocial motivation and reliance on internal signals are 140 related to multivariate neural patterns in the ACCg and AI, respectively. More similar patterns 141 between self and vicarious reward in the ACCg are associated with increased levels of prosocial 142 motivation but not motivation to obtain rewards for oneself. However, more dissimilar patterns in the 143 AI are correlated with higher propensity to be aware and use interoceptive signals. These results 144 highlight that even when simply observing other\u2019s rewarding outcomes, variability in responses in the 145 ACCg and AI can be linked to subsequent levels of prosociality and interoception, respectively. 146\n147\n148\nResults 149\nDuring the first fMRI session, participants completed a value representation task, where on 150 separate trials either themselves, or an anonymous stranger received or lost rewards of different 151 magnitudes. The stranger was a confederate who participants believed to be another participant in 152 the experiment. We followed a rigorous protocol (8, 54) to make sure participants believed in the 153 existence of the other person, ensuring anonymity and confidentiality (see Materials and Methods 154 and Supplementary Information for details). 155\nIn the behavioural session, the prosocial effort task required participants to make choices of 156 whether to squeeze a grip force device to obtain rewards either for themselves or for an anonymous 157 other. This task measured the amount of reward necessary to incentivise people to work, and the 158 degree of avoidance of the required physical effort when deciding whether to work for oneself or for 159 another person. In this behavioural session, participants also completed the respiratory interoception 160 task, where in each trial they performed an exhalation into a standard peak flow meter, and then a 161 subsequent second exhalation aiming to achieve a target percentage of the first exhalation. After the 162 second exhalation, participants were required to report what percentage they actually achieved. The 163 difference between their estimation and the actual percentage of their exhalation served as an index 164 of accuracy (see Materials and Methods equation 1). Trials were performed in one of two 165 conditions, an \u2018internal\u2019 condition where no external auditory cue could guide their performance, and 166 an \u2018external\u2019 condition where external auditory cues caused by their exhalation were available to be 167 used. Using this technique, a metric of reliance on interoceptive cues was calculated, by comparing 168 estimation accuracy between the internal and external conditions (see Materials and Methods 169 equation 2). If participants rely on exteroceptive cues, then removal of those cues should hamper 170 performance; conversely, if participants rely on interoceptive cues then performance should be 171 unaffected by removal of external cues. On this task, therefore, more positive values reflect more of a 172 reliance on (i.e. more propensity to be aware and use) interoceptive cues to complete the task 173 (Supplementary Fig. S1A). 174\n175\nBehavioural results: reliance on interoceptive signals is associated with prosocial motivation. 176\nPrevious research has suggested that people\u2019s propensity to rely on interoceptive signals is 177 correlated with their levels of altruism (16, 55). However the tasks used to measure prosocial or 178 interoceptive tendencies may confound different processes together and there have been questions 179 of their validity (51, 56, 57). Here, we address these issues using tasks to measure prosocial 180 behaviour and interoceptive processes without such confounds. Firstly, studies have used economic 181 games in which the rewards delivered to the other person directly impact on the magnitude of rewards 182 obtained oneself. Although interesting for quantifying variability in one\u2019s desire to benefit others, they 183 cannot distinguish between two different motives - sensitivity to one\u2019s own rewards, or an increasing 184 desire to give rewards to other people (11, 47). Here, we use a prosocial effort task that is able to 185 measure sensitivity to one\u2019s own and other\u2019s rewards, as well as separately measures sensitivity to 186\nexerting effort for oneself and others. Secondly, we used a respiratory interoceptive task that 187 measures individual differences in how much people rely on interoceptive information, i.e. the 188 propensity of people to be aware and use bodily signals, that has been validated and have overcome 189 some of the problems raised on previous tasks (51, 58). Furthermore, this task focuses on the extant 190 in which people are aware of their internal signal, rather than simply interoceptive accuracy, which 191 could be directly related to the role of AI in self-awareness and body ownership (34, 38). Thus, using 192 these two tasks we can therefore examine the relationship between interoception and prosocial 193 tendencies and test the hypothesis that stronger sensitivity to other\u2019s rewards is linked to one\u2019s 194 reliance on interoceptive processes 195\nWe tested whether reliance on interoceptive signals was associated with motivation for self 196 or/and others\u2019 rewards. A mixed effects model predicting choices to work or rest in the prosocial effort 197 task was conducted including level of effort, magnitude of reward, and beneficiary (self vs other), 198 together with their interactions (up to three-way), as fixed effects predictors. Random effects were 199 also included, with random intercepts at the subject level, and random slopes on effort level and 200 reward magnitude (see Materials and Methods equation 3). Model comparison revealed that 201 including participants\u2019 interoception scores from the respiratory task as an additional between-202 subjects predictor of choices in the prosocial effort task (see Materials and Methods equation 4) 203 improved model fit, both when penalising the model for additional parameters (AIC: simple model = 204 5115.5, interoception model = 5079.3; Supplementary Fig. S1B) and when performing a ratio test on 205 model log-likelihoods (\u03c72diff = 52.28, dfdiff = 8, p < 0.001). Thus, decisions to work in the prosocial effort 206 task were better explained by a statistical model that included participants\u2019 reliance on internal 207 signals. 208\nWe hypothesised that people who relied more on internal signals would be more motivated to 209 act prosocially, and that this would be specifically linked to how incentivised people are by others\u2019 210 rewards. Consistent with this, we found a three-way interaction between interoception score, reward 211 and beneficiary in the mixed effects model (b = 0.42, SEM = 0.11, z = 3.87, p < 0.001, Fig. 2A and 212 2B). Thus, during self trials participants were more likely to work as the rewards on offer increased, 213 but this effect was present regardless of their interoception score (Fig. 2A). In the other (prosocial) 214 trials, there was an effect of interoception, whereby people who relied more on interoceptive signals 215 were more incentivised to work at higher reward levels for others. Conversely, externally-focused 216 people were not incentivised to choose to work more often as the rewards that would be received by 217 the other person increased (Fig. 2B). 218\n219\n220\n221\n222\n223\n224\nIn addition, there was a two-way interaction between interoception and beneficiary (b = 0.65, 225 SEM = 0.12, z = 5.3, p < 0.001), such that participants who relied more on internal than external 226\nFigure 2. Reliance on interoceptive signals is associated with prosocial choices. A. Interoception score did not influence motivation for rewards in self trials. Participants did not show different patterns in their proportion of choices to work over rest (y-axis) depending on their level of reliance on internal vs external signals (x-axis) across different reward magnitudes. B. Interoception influences motivation for others\u2019 rewards. As participants relied more on internal than external cues, they chose to work more as the reward to be received by another person increased. Participants who relied more on external cues were more reluctant to work to benefit others regardless the reward on offer. Shaded areas show the 70% confidence interval around the slopes. Individual points show the score of each participant for each condition. C. People who rely more on internal vs external signals (x-axis), weighted rewards more similarly for self and other when making decisions to work to obtain rewards. Y-axis depicts the difference between self and other betas from two mixed models predicting choices separately for self and other. Higher values indicate self rewards are valued more than others\u2019. D. Participants who relied more on internal vs external cues (x-axis), were more sensitive to others\u2019 rewards (beta estimates, y-axis). Shaded areas show the 95% confidence interval around the slopes. Individual points show the score of each participant.\nsignals were more willing to work for others regardless of the rewards on offer or effort required 227 (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Notably, despite previous research suggesting a link between 228 interoception and people\u2019s sensitivity to effort, there was no such interaction in our data (see 229 Supplementary Table S1 for a full description of these results). Finally, the remaining findings of the 230 mixed model replicated the results of previous studies using the prosocial effort task (8, 10, 48, 52), 231 with significant effects of effort, reward and beneficiary, as well as interactions between reward and 232 beneficiary, and effort and beneficiary (see Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B). In sum, we show 233 that how much someone relies on internal signals is linked to how prosocial they are and not to their 234 motivation to work for themselves. Specifically, more internally-focused individuals are more 235 incentivised by the rewards that can be obtained for another person, and work more when they can 236 obtain a bigger benefit for them. 237\nGiven that in the prosocial effort task the majority of people choose to work more at lower 238 reward levels for themselves than for other people, this leads to a prediction that people with more 239 positive interoception scores (i.e. more internally focused, relying more on interoceptive signals) 240 would show less of a difference in decisions to work between self and other, as a function of reward. 241 Furthermore, given the results of the mixed model above, greater interoception scores should be 242 specifically associated with sensitivity to others\u2019 rewards and not with sensitivity to self rewards nor 243 sensitivity to effort. Thus, as a confirmatory, post-hoc analysis, we extracted beta parameters for effort 244 and reward from two mixed effect models where decisions to work or rest were taken separately for 245 self and other trials (see Materials and Methods equations 5 and 6). Thus, these indexes were a 246 proxy for individual differences in sensitivities to effort levels and magnitudes of rewards for self-247 benefitting and prosocial decisions. 248\nFrom the results described above, we expected interoception to be associated with sensitivity 249 to others\u2019 rewards and not to effort or self rewards. We tested this using Pearson correlations 250 between the interoception score, and reward and effort betas for self, other and their difference. 251 Results revealed a significant negative correlation between interoception and the difference in reward 252 betas, such that people who relied more on internal signals were more similarly motivated for self and 253 other rewards, while people who were more externally focused valued more their own rewards 254 compared to others\u2019 (r(59) = -0.39, p < 0.003, Fig. 2C). To test if this effect of interoception on prosocial 255 motivation was specific to sensitivity to rewards, we correlated difference in effort betas with 256 interoception. We found null correlation (r(59) = 0.15, p = 0.26), which was significantly different from 257 the correlation between interoception scores and sensitivity to reward (Fisher\u2019s Z transformation, z = -258 3, p < 0.003). As expected, the interoception score also correlated with sensitivity to others\u2019 rewards 259 (r(59) = 0.27, p < 0.04, Fig. 2D), but not with self rewards (r(59) = -0.14, p = 0.29; Supplementary Fig. 260 S2B), and these effects were significantly different from each other (z = 2.23, p < 0.03), suggesting 261 specificity of the social effects. Furthermore, interoception did not correlate with neither other (r(59) = -262 0.08, p = 0.54) nor self effort betas (r(59) = -0.13, p = 0.32), and these correlations showed a significant 263 difference (z = 2.19, p < 0.03) and a non-significant trend from its effects on other reward betas (z = 264 1.92, p = 0.055), suggesting that interoception is specifically associated to sensitivity to others\u2019 265\nrewards in the effort task. Taken together, these results reveal that people who rely more in internal 266 versus external signals are specifically more driven by others\u2019 rewards when deciding whether to 267 expend energy to act prosocially. 268\n269\nfMRI results: Different roles of the ACCg and the right dorsal AI in vicarious rewards. 270\nNext, we examined whether the degree of similarity between neural patterns evoked by self 271 and other rewards during the fMRI value representation task was predicted by prosocial motivation 272 and interoception. Multivariate similarity analysis was calculated as the Pearson correlation between 273 the average parametric map for self and other rewards (53). Thus, the similarity index represents the 274 spatial similarity between the patterns of activation for self and other rewards across the different 275 reward levels for each participant. Our hypotheses specifically related to the ACCg and AI due to their 276 unique profiles of being linked to interoception, prosociality and vicarious reward processing (2, 15, 277 19, 25, 32, 38). We therefore included five ROIs: four AI portions - right dorsal AI (RdAI), right ventral 278 AI (RvAI), left ventral AI (LvAI) and left dorsal (LdAI) -, and the ACCg (bilateral). Traditional whole-279 brain univariate analyses performed on the same data are reported in Supplementary Tables S2 280 and S3. 281\nFive regression models were used to test whether the degree of similarity between self and 282 other representations of reward was associated with interoception, one in each ROI, with the similarity 283 of self and other representations being the dependent variable and participants\u2019 interoception score 284 (reflecting their reliance on interoceptive signals) as a predictor. Only one area, the RdAI, showed a 285 significant effect (b = -1.01, F(1,52) = 11.12, p < 0.008 FDR corrected). No effects were found in any of 286 the other ROIs. Within the RdAI, less similar responses between self and other rewards were linked to 287 people relying more on their internal signals (Fig. 3A), suggesting that a greater specialisation of 288 neural responses to others\u2019 rewards in this region occurs in people who are more aware and use 289 interoceptive signals. 290\nNext, we hypothesised that variability in vicarious reward responses would be related to how 291 incentivised a participant was by others\u2019 rewards in the prosocial effort task. We used the same 292 regression approach in each ROI, to test whether similarity in the neural response between self and 293 other reward was related to a beta-weight reflecting someone\u2019s sensitivity to others\u2019 rewards in the 294 prosocial effort task. We found a significant effect in only one ROI, the ACCg (b = 0.07, F(1,53) = 7.36, 295 p < 0.05 FDR corrected, Fig. 3B). Within the ACCg, greater similarity in responses between self and 296 other reward was predictive of increased incentivisation by others\u2019 rewards in the prosocial effort task. 297 That is, people who showed a greater increase in choosing to help others as the rewards on offer 298 increased, showed more similar neural patterns between self and other rewards. Note that both the 299 results within the ACCg and RdAI were also present independently of the statistical method used to 300 relate them, with similar results in both areas when Pearson correlation instead of regression models 301 were used (see Supplementary Information). Furthermore, in both ACCg and RdAI, similarity 302 between self and other was significantly above zero (Supplementary Table S4). 303\n304\nAnalyses of the behavioural data revealed that interoception and sensitivity to others reward 305 in the effort task were correlated, suggesting shared variance. However, analyses of the neural data 306 demonstrated different effects of interoception and prosocial behaviour in distinct ROIs. In order to 307 investigate whether the effects in the ACCg and RdAI remain when this shared variance is included in 308 the model, two regression models were conducted, one in each region, in which the beta weight 309 measuring incentivisation by other rewards from the effort task, and the interoception score, were 310 both included as predictors of neural similarity. Both the effect of other reward in the ACCg (b = 0.06, 311 F(1,52) = 6.25, p < 0.02) and interoception in the RdAI remained significant (b = -1.21, F(1,51) = 14.74, p 312 < 0.001). As such, although people\u2019s reliance on interoception and motivation by others\u2019 rewards are 313\nrelated to each other, the responses in the ACCg and RdAI are linked specifically to prosocial 314 motivation and interoception, respectively. 315\nAn advantage of using the prosocial effort task is that it also measures how sensitive people 316 are to their own benefits (self reward), as well as how costly they find effort both when benefiting 317 themselves (self effort) and others (other effort). To test the specificity of the effects above, we 318 conducted two further regression models, one for the ACCg and one for the RdAI, including those 319 three predictors. We found no significant effects in the ACCg nor in the RdAI for any of these 320 predictors even at uncorrected thresholds (see Supplementary Tables S4 and S5 for details). Thus, 321 vicarious rewards processing in the ACCg was specifically linked to how incentivised people were by 322 others\u2019 reward in the prosocial effort task, and similarity in the AI was linked specifically to 323 interoception. 324\nTaken together, vicarious reward signals in the RdAI and ACCg were linked to different 325 processes: interoception, and motivation to obtain benefits for others, respectively. However, 326 behaviourally, reliance on interoceptive signals was associated with higher motivation to obtain 327 rewards for others in the effort task. Crucially, this link was specific for others\u2019 rewards and not for self. 328 Thus, the connectivity between RdAI (linked to interoception) and ACCg (linked to prosocial 329 motivation) in reward processing might be stronger when evaluating others\u2019 than self rewards. Could 330 connectivity between ACCg and RdAI underlie this link between prosocial motivation and reliance on 331 internal signals? We used beta series regressions (59) to assess individual differences in the 332 functional connectivity between the ROIs in each task condition (self and other). Specifically, for each 333 participant, we calculated the mean value for ACCg and RdAI during each trial and calculated the 334 regression coefficient of those values across all trials and within each condition of interest. This 335 allowed calculation of a beta estimate indicating the functional connectivity between ACCg and RdAI 336 for each participant and condition, enabling comparison of the degree of connectivity between ACCg 337 and RdAI in the self and the other condition. Significantly higher connectivity was found in the other 338 compared with the self condition (t(52) = 3.72, p < 0.001, Supplementary Fig. S4), suggesting that 339 these areas are functionally more associated when reward events occurred to another person 340 compared to participants themselves. 341\nNext, we tested whether connectivity between RdAI and ACCg in response to other rewards 342 was associated with reliance on interoceptive signals and/or sensitivity to others\u2019 rewards in the 343 prosocial effort task. Thus, a regression model in which the dependant variable was neural 344 connectivity between these regions, having the interoception score and other reward betas in the 345 prosocial effort task as predictors, did not reveal significant effects (see Supplementary Table S6 for 346 details). 347\n348\nDiscussion 349\nWe often observe good and bad outcomes for other people. However, how this experience of 350 vicarious processing relates on our interoceptive signals or how willing we are to engage in prosocial 351\nbehaviours remains largely unknown. Our results show that even when simply seeing rewarding 352 outcomes for others, variability in vicarious processing in the ACCg and AI is linked to someone\u2019s 353 prosocial tendencies and their propensity to be aware and use interoceptive signals, respectively. In 354 particular, whilst greater dissimilarity between neural responses to self and vicarious rewards was 355 associated with increased reliance on interoceptive signals in the AI, greater similarity in the ACCg 356 was linked to being more incentivised by rewards that could be obtained for others by prosocial acts. 357 Functional connectivity between these regions was higher when participants observed others 358 receiving reward outcomes than when they did themselves. Thus, these results indicate that 359 processing of vicarious rewards is linked to levels of interoception and prosocial behaviour. In 360 addition, at the behavioural level, how incentivised and motivated people are to obtain rewards for 361 others relates to the propensity to be aware and use interoceptive cues, with more prosocial people 362 being more focused on internal signals. This effect was specific, with reliance on internal signals not 363 related to motivation to benefit oneself, or to the effort required to act prosocially. Taken together, 364 these results suggest that variability in the patterns of neural responses to rewards are associated 365 with interoception and prosocial behaviour. 366\nThe AI and ACCg have consistently been shown to be engaged when people passively 367 monitor the receipt of rewards by either the self or others (2, 18\u201321), although this was not reflected in 368 our univariate whole brain results. However, whilst both the AI and ACCg have been linked to 369 vicarious reward processing, we show that variability in their response suggests a functional 370 dissociation, which has the potential to unify separate lines of research into interoception, motivation 371 and vicarious reward processing. Specifically, only the AI was associated with interoceptive signals. 372 Previous research has suggested that the AI can be thought of as a secondary interoceptive cortex, 373 due to the fact that it is heavily connected to regions that receive afferent signals from a number of 374 sensory organs (34, 60\u201362). It has been argued that the function of AI is therefore to integrate 375 interoceptive signals with other cognitive and affective processes (34, 60, 61). However, limited 376 research has demonstrated a link between reward signals, that have often been found in the AI, to 377 interoceptive processes. By using a multivariate technique, we were able to show that vicarious 378 reward signals, specifically in the RdAI, are linked to reliance on interoceptive signals, highlighting 379 that responses to vicarious rewards might reflect a stable trait that are associated to how much 380 someone\u2019s internal signals guide their behaviour. 381\nInterestingly, the association between interoception and AI was specifically located in its 382 dorsal part in the right hemisphere. This is consistent with previous work that proposes functional and 383 anatomical division in the AI (63, 64). Thus, its ventral portion is believed to be mainly involved in 384 affective reactivity toward salient outcomes impacting self and others, while its dorsal area (especially 385 in the right hemisphere) has been more specifically linked to interoception, providing a bodily map for 386 a wide range of mental processes (32, 34, 38, 46, 63\u201366). Posterior insula, involved in primary 387 interoceptive representation of the physiological state of the body through thalamocortical pathways, 388 has strong connections with dAI, and both share some of their connectivity fingerprints (34, 38, 46, 389 63, 65, 66). Through its connections with areas such as the prefrontal cortex, the ACC and the limbic 390\nsystem (34, 38, 46, 63, 64), dAI is crucial for self-awareness, where multiple sources of information 391 are integrated to represent body-ownership and sense of agency (34, 38), which might be key for the 392 distinction between self and other processes (67). Previous results indirectly suggest that the right AI, 393 including its dorsal portion, have different mechanisms underlying vicarious and self outcomes (68\u2013394 72), supporting the notion that RdAI might have representations of vicarious rewards anchored to 395 bodily changes, important for self-other differentiation. 396\nNotably, our results suggest that response to others\u2019 reward in the ACCg better reflects 397 people\u2019s motivation to perform prosocial acts than their interoceptive propensity. Classical accounts 398 have suggested that there is a functional dissociation between these regions, with the insula 399 implicated in affective and bodily processes and frontal areas including the ACC implicated in 400 motivating behaviour (34, 43\u201345). However, the presence of vicarious reward signals in both the AI 401 and ACCg did not seem to fit with such a division. Here we show that it is the degree to which the AI 402 represents others\u2019 rewards as distinct from self rewards that is associated with interoceptive signals, 403 and the same distinctiveness in ACCg that is associated with levels of motivation, specifically the 404 willingness to help others. As such, the hypothesised division between AI and ACC suggested by 405 classical accounts of their function is supported, with distinctiveness of vicarious signals of reward 406 highlighting the distinct functions of the insula and ACC. 407\nAlthough the classical account also posits that medial frontal cortex is involved in motivating 408 behaviour, it is less clear that there would be a link specifically between vicarious signals in the ACCg 409 and prosocial motivation. Previous studies in macaques have suggested that lesions that encompass 410 the ACCg as well as surrounding portions of the ACC prevent monkeys from executing previously-411 learned prosocial behaviours, whilst leaving self-benefitting behaviours intact (73). Local field 412 potentials and single-unit recordings have shown that neurons in the ACCg respond specifically when 413 monkeys make a choice to deliver rewards to another rather than to themselves (74, 75). However, 414 despite a number of studies showing vicarious reward signals in the ACCg, and that variability in 415 these signals is linked to self-reported empathy and disrupted in autism spectrum disorders (20, 76, 416 77), very few studies in humans had linked these signals to directly-measured variability in prosocial 417 behaviour. Here, we found that variability between people in the distinctiveness of ACCg vicarious 418 reward signals was linked to how willing someone was to engage in prosocial acts, directly linking 419 vicarious signals in this region with prosocial motivation. 420\nAlthough these results in the ACCg and RdAI are correlational and require replication, they 421 directly relate to broader discussions about whether common-currency or specialisation is more 422 important for social and interoceptive processes (1, 25, 47, 67, 78). Usually, studies researching 423 social information processing examine overlap between clusters responding to self or other rewards in 424 a univariate analysis, or examine clusters that show a difference between self and other at the 425 population level. Less work has examined individual differences in how distinct self and other reward 426 processing is within a region, and there are very few studies that have used multivariate techniques 427 that directly test how similar responses are between self and other rewards. 428\nRecently, it has been demonstrated that multivariate pattern analysis techniques may be 429 more robust for examining individual differences than traditional univariate statistical approaches (79). 430 Here, by deploying this technique we showed that, within AI, specialisation for processing others\u2019 431 rewards \u2013 less similarity in patterns between self and other reward \u2013 was related to greater reliance 432 on interoceptive cues. As such, specialisation and identification of self and other rewards might be a 433 distinguishing feature related to how AI processes interoceptive information. In contrast, in the ACCg, 434 there was evidence that greater similarity in patterns between self and other reward was linked to 435 increased prosociality in the effort task. Although this might argue in favour of a common-currency 436 account, it is notable that the multivariate technique examines spatial disparity in terms of patterns, 437 rather than overlap in voxels as examined with traditional methods. This work highlights that neither 438 account in isolation can explain how the brain processes social information. This is also reflected in 439 how the interaction between interoception and prosocial behaviour might be implemented in the brain. 440 We showed that ACCg and RdAI are more functionally connected when people observe others\u2019 441 reward outcomes than self. This could suggest that these areas, and potentially the link between 442 interoception and prosocial behaviour, are mainly socially-specific. However, interpreting the links 443 between behaviour, multivariate representations and connectivity seems too speculative, and 444 conciliating these three approaches is beyond the scope of this study. Thus, the connectivity results 445 add complexity to our main findings, and encourage future research to shed light on the \u2018social brain\u2019 446 debate. As such, common-currency and specialisation rooted accounts will need to be adapted to 447 account for multivariate similarity analyses, and individual differences in such patterns, to move 448 forward our understanding of the implementation of social information processing in the brain (47). 449\nFinally, we found a behavioural link between prosocial motivation and interoception. 450 Theoretical accounts posit that interoceptive signals might drive people to behave more prosocially 451 (12, 16, 60, 80). Here, we show that people who have higher propensity to be aware and use 452 interoceptive signals are more incentivised and motivated to help others, especially when the reward 453 to be received by others increases, than people who rely more on external signals. Thus, we expand 454 previous research reporting levels of altruism in economic games associated with levels of 455 interoception (16). We used measurements that allow us to identify that increased sensitivity to 456 rewards for others was specifically associated with reliance on interoceptive signal, rather than 457 changes in one\u2019s own experience of reward or effort. This might relate to the potential link between 458 empathetic processes and interoception (81). Our results therefore support the notion that prosocial 459 behaviour may be driven by how sensitive someone is to their internal bodily signals, mediated by 460 sensitivity to others\u2019 outcomes. 461\nIn conclusion, we show that vicarious reward processing, interoception and prosocial 462 behaviour are closely linked. People who show a greater propensity to be aware and use 463 interoceptive signals are more incentivised when they can obtain rewards for others and act more 464 prosocially. Neural representations of passively observed vicarious reward in the AI and ACCg were 465 able to predict people\u2019s degree of reliance on internal signals and their levels of prosociality, 466 respectively. These results suggest that social behaviour is complex and relies on both shared 467\nrepresentations and self-other distinctions in the ACC and the AI, which might work together when 468 facing a social situation. These findings highlight how important our everyday observations of others\u2019 469 rewards may be for our subsequent internal and social lives. 470\n471\nMaterials and Methods 472\nParticipants 473\nThe study was approved by the University of Oxford ethics committee. 80 healthy volunteers 474 aged 18-38 years, recruited from the University and the city of Oxford, participated in the study, gave 475 informed consent and were compensated for their time (\u00a315 per hour for the fMRI session, \u00a38 per 476 hour for behavioural session, plus extra potential bonuses earned through the reward-related tasks). 477 Participants were excluded if they had a history of neurological or neuropsychiatric disorders, 478 psychoactive medication or drug use. Pregnant participants were also excluded from the study, as 479 well as those who had participated in studies involving social interaction and who had studied 480 psychology, addressing concerns that prior experience could influence psychological and brain 481 processes. 482\n61 participants (age M = 22.6, SD = 3.8, 32 females) were included in the behavioural 483 analysis \u2013 four participants failed to show-up for the behavioural session, two participants expressed 484 doubts about the social manipulation and the existence of the receiver, nine did not complete either 485 the interoception respiratory task or the prosocial effort task, and four were excluded from analysis 486 because of poor quality data in either of the two tasks (see below). From these 61 participants, 56 487 were included for the fMRI analysis (age M = 22.3, SD = 3.3, 30 females). One participant\u2019s 488 neuroimaging data was not registered due to technical issues, one participant showed excessive 489 head motion, and three participants were excluded from analysis due to poor quality data in the value 490 representation task (see below). 491\n492\nGeneral Procedure 493\nParticipants took part in an fMRI and a separate behavioural session. The value 494 representation task was performed while in the fMRI scanner, whereas the interoception respiratory 495 task and the prosocial effort task were tested as part of a behavioural testing session, performed at 496 least one week after the fMRI session. 497\nfMRI session: Value representation task. 498\nBefore entering the scanner, participants were mock-randomly assigned the role of the 499 Decider while another unknown person, a confederate, was assigned the role of the Receiver, 500 following a well-established social manipulation protocol (8, 54) (see Supplementary Information for 501 details). Participants were instructed that, on each trial, a computer would randomly select a value to 502 add or to subtract to their total earnings (self trials) or to the earnings of the receiver (other trials). 503\nThus, participants passively observed screens indicating that themselves or the anonymous receiver 504 had gained or lost different amounts of reward. From this set of trials, participants were told that one 505 of them would be randomly selected and added or subtracted to the receivers\u2019 or to their own 506 earnings at the end of the study. However, to avoid reducing participants\u2019 compensation, a trial with a 507 gain of \u00a33 for themselves was always selected. 508\nThere were 12 different types of trials in the task according to a 2 (target: self, other) x 6 509 (value: -\u00a315, -\u00a39, -\u00a33, \u00a33, \u00a39, \u00a315) design. Each trial consisted of a screen indicating \u201cYou OR 510 Receiver / Won OR Lost / Value\u201d presented on a light grey background for 1400 ms followed by a 100 511 ms interstimulus interval. Furthermore, catch trials with the same duration were also presented to 512 ensure attention to the task, as well as null trials presented for 3000 ms. The trial presentation order 513 was pseudo-randomised using a \u201ctype 1 index 1\u201d sequence which ensures that each stimulus is 514 preceded and followed by all other stimuli (82, 83). For the purpose of this experiment, the four most 515 efficient \u201ctype 1 index 1\u201d sequences were chosen among 1000 randomly generated sequences using 516 the Python code available online (https://cfn.upenn.edu/aguirre/wiki/public:t1i1_sequences/). Each of 517 the four chosen sequences included 14 presentations of each stimulus \u2013 14 repetitions x 14 trials (12 518 reward trials + one catch trial + one null/blank trial) - for a total of 196 trials. Since the full experiment 519 included four sequences, 56 presentations of each stimulus were included with a scanning time of 520 approximately 21 minutes across the four runs. The presentation order of the four sequences was 521 counterbalanced across participants. 522\nCatch trials were included to ensure that participants maintained attention across all trials 523 without influencing the processing of the magnitude and the target of the gain or loss. During these 524 catch trials, participants were asked to indicate as quickly as possible if recipient of the previous trial 525 was the self or the receiver (i.e. \u201cYou or Receiver?\u201d) or to identify the amount that was awarded in the 526 previous trial compared to a randomly generated amount (e.g. \u201cWon \u00a315 or Lost \u00a39\u201d) using a 527 response box. Accuracy at the catch trial task was computed by counting the number of correct 528 answers and dividing it by the total number of catch trials. Participants who had an accuracy below 529 50% of the catch trials were excluded from analysis (n = 3). 530\nBehavioural session: Prosocial effort task 531\nThe prosocial effort task measures how motivated participants are to obtain rewards for self 532 and others (8, 48, 52). Participants in this task were instructed that, as Deciders, they would be paired 533 with one of the Receivers of the experiment, but not the same one they had in the fMRI session. The 534 task consisted of participants making decisions between options with different magnitudes of financial 535 rewards (represented by number of credits) in exchange for different levels of physical effort (grip 536 force). For each trial, participants chose between two options: a rest baseline option associated with 537 no effort and low reward (1 credit); and a work offer option, which results in higher monetary gain (2, 538 4, 6, 8 and 10 credits) for higher effort that varies across 30, 40, 50, 60 or 70% of each participant\u2019s 539 maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). In half of the trials the reward was obtained by participants 540 themselves (self trials), while in the other half rewards were received by the Receiver (other trials). If 541\nthe work option was chosen, participants needed to make the effort required to obtain the credits on 542 offer - they needed to squeeze a handle with the required force with their dominant hand for 1 s out of 543 a 3 s window. They received zero credit if they failed to do so. If the rest option was chosen, 544 participants rested for the same amount of time and obtained the single credit in exchange. The effort 545 and reward levels in the work option varied independently over trials, and each effort\u2013reward 546 combination was repeated three times per beneficiary condition, giving a total of 150 trials: 75 self 547 trials and 75 other trials. The rest option with one credit was used to make sure that there was a 548 conscious and motivated decision to choose the alternative work option. If a choice was not selected, 549 zero credits were given. All trials had the same duration, controlling for potential temporal discounting 550 effects. Participants who did not actively choose any of the options for more than 10% of the trials 551 were excluded from analysis (n = 1). 552\nBefore participants made decisions in the prosocial effort task, they were asked to grip a 553 handheld dynamometer with as much force as they could to determine their MVC. Thus, the task 554 measures similar effort levels across participants regardless of their variability in strength. After MVC 555 estimation and prior to the main decision task, participants completed 18 trials where they 556 experienced each effort level three times, and also learned to associate each level of effort with the 557 elements in the pie chart (e.g. one element of the pie chart corresponded to 0% force, i.e. the rest 558 option). 559\nBehavioural Session: Interoception respiratory task 560\nThe goal of this task (51) was to assess how much participants rely on their internal signals 561 relative to exteroceptive cues when assessing the force of their exhalation. To assess participants\u2019 562 force of exhalation, a standard peak flow meter was used. Participants who had a history of breathing 563 difficulties did not undertake this task. On each trial, participants were first required to make a large 564 exhalation into the peak flow meter. This first exhalation was taken as the \u2018standard\u2019 for that trial, i.e., 565 100% performance. Participants were then required to perform a second exhalation. In this second, 566 \u2018target\u2019 exhalation, participants were told to aim to perform a percentage of the standard exhalation 567 (e.g., 30%) for that trial. There were four possible targets for each trial - 30, 50 70 or 90% of the 568 standard. Once the participant had performed the target, they were asked by the experimenter to 569 estimate their performance as a percentage of the standard. The accuracy of their estimate 570 (difference between their estimate of the force of their second blow as a percentage of the standard 571 and the objectively-measured force of their second blow, see equation 1) served as the dependent 572 variable for each condition. 573\nTrials in the interoception respiratory task were completed under two conditions. In the 574 internal condition, participants performed the standard and the target exhalations while hearing 575 background white noise through headphones connected to a laptop (~79 decibels), ensuring they 576 were unable to hear auditory cues produced by their exhalation, and thus could rely only on their 577 internal signals when judging exhalation force. In the external condition, participants performed each 578 exhalation with a background white noise coming from a laptop loudspeaker (~79 decibels) located 579\napproximately one meter from their right ear. Thus, in the external condition, although participants had 580 an equally-distracting auditory input as in the internal condition, this auditory input did not mask the 581 noise of their exhalation. As a result, participant could rely on auditory external cues when judging the 582 force of their exhalation. For both conditions, the white noise started approximately one second before 583 the exhalation, lasting for four seconds. Contrasting the performance in each of these conditions 584 allows to measure the extent to which participants rely on interoceptive (relative to exteroceptive) 585 signals. If in the external condition, where both internal and external signals are available to judge the 586 force of one\u2019s exhalation, a participant only uses external cues, then their performance is likely to 587 differ markedly in the internal condition where external cues are unavailable. Conversely, if a 588 participant relies entirely on internal signals to judge the force of their exhalation in the external 589 condition \u2013 even though external cues are also available \u2013 then their performance should be relatively 590 unaffected in the internal condition as internal signals are still available to be used. 591\nDuring the task, and across conditions, participants were blindfolded, to prevent them using 592 visual information to aid performance. For both internal and external conditions, participants 593 completed six repetitions of the four targets presented in a random order, with a total of 24 trials per 594 condition. The order in which the internal and the external conditions were presented was 595 counterbalanced across participants. To ensure that the 30% target trial could be measured, 596 participants were required to surpass a threshold of 200 L/min in their standard exhalation. If they did 597 not accomplish this, the standard blow was repeated until the threshold was surpassed. No feedback 598 about participants\u2019 performance was provided across the experiment. 599\nThe peak-flow meter into which participants performed their exhalations was gently secured in 600 a horizontal position using a vice clamp and elevated in line with each participant\u2019s mouth using a 601 stand. Participants were instructed to keep their hands resting at the bottom of the stand during 602 exhalations, using their hands only to locate the gauge prior to performing exhalations, and to be still 603 in the chair and sat upright, without pushing the mouthpiece forward while exhaling. Trials in which 604 these conditions were not accomplished were repeated or removed from analysis. Participants with 605 more than 10% of missed trials in either of the two conditions were excluded (n = 3). 606\n607\nAnalysis of behavioural data 608\nInteroception score: reliance on internal vs external signals. 609\nTo calculate participants\u2019 reliance on their interoceptive signals, the absolute error scores 610 were computed for each trial of the interoception respiratory task, such that: 611\n(1) \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57 = [ \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57 \u2212 \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57\n\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57 ] 612\n\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc57\u0305\u0305 \u0305\u0305 \u0305 { \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc38\u0305\u0305 \u0305\u0305 \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59 \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc60\n\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc38\u0305\u0305 \u0305\u0305 \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59 \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59 613\n614\nWhere the absolute error AE in the trial i for the participant j is the absolute difference 615 between the actual performance of the participant in target T as a percentage of the standard, and 616 their estimation E, divided by their actual performance T. The mean of the AEs is computed 617 separately for the internal and the external conditions for each participant. The interoception score 618 was then the difference in performance between the internal and the external condition, such that: 619\n(2) \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc57 = \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc38\u0305\u0305 \u0305\u0305 \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc61[\ud835\udc57] \u2212 \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc38\u0305\u0305 \u0305\u0305 \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61[\ud835\udc57] 620\nWhere the interoception score for the participant j is the difference between their mean AEs in 621 the external condition and in the internal condition. Scores below zero indicate that a participant made 622 more mistakes in the internal than the external conditions, suggesting that they are more externally-623 focused. The interoception score therefore reflects how much participants rely on internal versus 624 external signals. 625\nAssociation between interoception and motivation 626\nFor the prosocial effort task, choices to work relative to rest were taken as an index of 627 motivation to obtain self and other rewards. Mixed effects models were used to predict trial-by-trial 628 decisions using the glmer function in R. Thus, two models were built to test whether interoception was 629 linked to participants decisions, and to which variable (effort or reward for self or for other) in their 630 motivation, such that: 631\nSimple model 632\n(3) \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc56 = \ud835\udefd0\ud835\udc57[\ud835\udc56] + \ud835\udefd1\ud835\udc57[\ud835\udc56]\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udefd2\ud835\udc57[\ud835\udc56]\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udefd3\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udefd4\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udefd5\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udefd6\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udefd7\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc56 633\n634\nInteroception model 635\n(4) \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc56 = \ud835\udefd0\ud835\udc57[\ud835\udc56] + \ud835\udefd1\ud835\udc57[\ud835\udc56]\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udefd2\ud835\udc57[\ud835\udc56]\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udefd3\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udefd4\ud835\udc3c + \ud835\udefd5\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udefd6\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udefd7\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc3c + \ud835\udefd8\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udefd9\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc3c636 + \ud835\udefd10\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc3c + \ud835\udefd11\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udefd12\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc3c + \ud835\udefd13\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc3c + \ud835\udefd14\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc3c + \ud835\udefd15\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc3c 637\n638\nIn the simple model, decision to work DW in the trial i was predicted by the fixed effects of 639 reward R, effort E, beneficiary B and their interaction, with a random intercept clustered in each 640 subject j. DW is a binary, factor variable. Random slopes for R and E were included as it is expected 641 for these variables to vary across participants (8, 48, 52). The interoception model adds the 642 interoception score I as a predictor together with its interaction with the other independent variables. 643\nAs a post-hoc analysis, we tested for Pearson correlations between the interoception scores 644 and reward and effort beta values obtained for each participant from two mixed models where 645 decisions to work were predicted by effort, rewards and their interaction. These reward and effort 646\nbetas were used as a proxy for individual differences in participants\u2019 sensitivities to reward and effort 647 in self and prosocial decisions separately. Crucially, each model considered beneficiaries separately 648 for self and other. These two models were clustered with random-intercepts for each participant, and 649 had random-slopes for reward and effort, such that: 650\n651\n(5) \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc53 = \ud835\udefd0\ud835\udc57[\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc53] + \ud835\udefd1\ud835\udc57[\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc53]\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udefd2\ud835\udc57[\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc53]\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udefd3[\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc53]\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc56 652\n(6) \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc61\u210e\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f = \ud835\udefd0\ud835\udc57[\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc61\u210e\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f] + \ud835\udefd1\ud835\udc57[\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc61\u210e\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f]\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udefd2\ud835\udc57[\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc61\u210e\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f]\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc56 + \ud835\udefd3[\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc61\u210e\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f]\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc56 653\n654\nWhere DW is specific for self and for other trials separately. Thus, the interoception score was 655 correlated with motivation to work represented by participants\u2019 beta estimates for reward and effort for 656 self, other. For comparison between correlation coefficients Fisher Z-transformation were performed 657 using the online tool at http://vassarstats.net/rdiff.html. 658\n659\nfMRI acquisition and preprocessing 660\nMRI data were acquired using a 3 Tesla Siemens Prisma MRI scanner. A structural scan was 661 acquired at the start of the session using a magnetisation-prepared rapid gradient echo sequence 662 with 192 slices; slice thickness: 1 mm; repetition time (TR): 1900 ms; echo time (TE): 97 ms; field of 663 view (FOV): 192 \u00d7 192 mm; voxel size: 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 mm. Field map images were obtained immediately 664 before the value representation task using a double-echo spoiled gradient echo sequence (TR: 488 665 ms; TE: 4.92/7.38 ms; voxel size: 3x3x3 mm; flip angle: 46\u00b0). Four runs of multiband T2*-weighted 666 echo-planar imaging (EPI) volumes with BOLD contrast were collected during the value 667 representation task (72 slices in interleaved ascending order; repetition time: 1570 ms; echo time: 30 668 ms; flip angle: 70\u00b0; field of view: 216x216 mm; matrix size: 108x108; voxel size: 2x2x2 mm with 1 mm 669 gap; multi-band factor: 3; in-plane acceleration factor: 2). Each run was 5:46 minutes in length, during 670 which 220 functional volumes were acquired. 671\nPreprocessing was performed following a standard protocol using fMRIPrep 20.1.0rc1 (45), 672 which is based on Nipype 1.4.2 (46). The details of preprocessing can be found in the Supplementary 673 Material. 674\n675\nfMRI analyses 676\nFirst Level 677\nFirst, a general linear model was created of the BOLD response at the participant level using 678 SPM12, with regressors modelling the onset of each event, i.e. -\u00a315, -\u00a39, -\u00a33, \u00a33, \u00a39, \u00a315 for self and 679 other, and the onset of the catch trials. The regressors were generated using delta functions 680\nconvolved with SPM12\u2019s canonical haemodynamic response function. This first level model also 681 included nuisance regressors modelling non-neural sources: (i) 24 movement-related regressors 682 comprising the six estimated head movement parameters (x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw), their first temporal 683 derivatives, their squares, and their squared derivatives; (ii) the first six components of the anatomical 684 CompCor extracted using the CompCor method (84) implemented in fMRIprep; and (iii) a variable 685 number of single event regressors indicating volumes exceeding a threshold of 0.5 mm framewise 686 displacement or 1.5 standardised DVARS and considered as motion outliers (mean % of volumes that 687 were motion outliers = 1.04%, SD = 0.91%). The four runs were concatenated in the model and 688 constant regressors were added to model each of the four run\u2019s mean. The null trials were used as 689 the un-modelled baseline in all models. A high-pass filter with a cut-off of 128 s and SPM12\u2019s AR(1) 690 correction for serial correlation were applied during the model estimation. 691\nTo calculate functional connectivity between regions of interest in various conditions using 692 beta series regressions (59), we also modelled the BOLD response for individual trials using the Least 693 Square Single models approach (85). We therefore fitted a GLM for each trial of interest (468 trials) in 694 which the first regressor was the onset of the trial of interest, the second regressor the onset of all 695 other trials within the session and the other regressors were the nuisance regressors described 696 above. To ensure that the single trial regressors included in the analyses were not collinear with 697 nuisance regressors, we calculated the variance inflation factor (VIF) for each trial and excluded trials 698 with a VIF > 4 from all analyses. This removed on average 3% (SD = 6%) of trials across participants. 699\nSecond level 700\nFor group statistical analysis, whole-brain SPM analysis was performed using a single-sample 701 t-test to examine the contrast of self > other, and other > self conditions averaged across all reward 702 events, using a cluster-level probability threshold of PFWE < 0.05, with clusters defined by the voxel-703 level threshold Puncorrected < 0.001. 704\nSimilarity analysis 705\nWe measured multivariate similarity between self and other trials by calculating the Pearson 706 correlation between the average parametric maps for each condition of interest, i.e., self and other, in 707 five ROIs. These correlation coefficients for each participant were used to assess the relationship 708 between individual differences in self/other neural similarity and performance on the interoception 709 respiratory task and the prosocial effort task. Null correlations between similarity in these ROIs and 710 participants\u2019 mean framewise displacement suggest that these values were not a product of 711 participants\u2019 movements in the scanner (see Supplementary Information). 712\nWe based our analyses on the AI and the ACCg as ROIs. For the AI portions, we used the 713 parcellations created by Deen et al., 2011 (86) derived from a voxel-wise k-means clustering 714 approach applied to resting-state. These parcellations divide the insular cortex in three different 715 complexes for each hemisphere: posterior insula, dorsal AI and ventral AI. The 6 insula ROIs were 716 acquired in 2 mm Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space directly from the author\u2019s website 717 (https://bendeen.com/data/). Within the AI there is putatively more than one anatomical zone, with a 718\nparticular distinction in function between dorsal and ventral AI. However, it is unclear which of these 719 sub-regions may be linked specifically to vicarious reward processing. As such, we used right and left 720 vAI and dAI ROIs. 721\nFor the ACCg region, we used thresholded masks taken from the resting-state connectivity-722 based parcellation by Neubert et al., 2015 (87). This parcellation divides the frontal cortex into 21 723 different regions. The parcels were acquired in 2 mm MNI space directly from the author\u2019s website 724 (http://www.rbmars.dds.nl/CBPatlases.htm). We created the ACCg mask by modifying the original 725 parcel using the imcalc function in SPM12. Thus, the left hemisphere parcel for the area 24ab was 726 duplicated onto the right hemisphere to create a bilateral mask. Furthermore, those voxels located in 727 the posterior portion of the mask were removed to capture more closely what the literature refers to as 728 ACCg, corresponding to the gyral portion of the anterior mid-cingulate cortex (25, 88). 729\nSimilarity values obtained across these five ROIs were predicted by the interoception score 730 and behavioural indexes in the prosocial effort task. For the latter, we used the reward and effort beta-731 weights obtained for each participant from the two mixed models previously described (equations 5 732 and 6) where decisions to work were predicted by effort, rewards and their interaction separately for 733 self and other. For each regression model where ROI self/other similarity was predicted by 734 behavioural measures, participants who had similarity values below and above three standard 735 deviations were excluded. For the similarity values in RdAI, RvAI, LdAI and LvAI, robust regression 736 models were used using the rlm function in R. For the similarity values in the ACCg, linear regression 737 models were used instead as values in this region were normally distributed. All behavioural 738 measures were normally distributed. Results obtained from these models were corrected for multiple 739 comparison across the five ROIs using false discovery rate (FDR) (89, 90). 740\nFunctional connectivity analyses 741\nWe used beta series regressions (59) to assess individual differences in the functional 742 connectivity between the ROIs in in each task condition. Specifically, for each participant, we 743 calculated the mean value in ACCg and RdAI at each trial and calculated the regression coefficient 744 between their combination across all trials for self and other. This allowed us to obtain a beta estimate 745 parameter indicating the functional connectivity between ACCg and RdAI for each participant and 746 condition. Paired t-test was used to test for differences in connectivity between self and other trials. 747 Prior to this analysis, participants who had similarity values in both the ACCg and RdAI below and 748 above three standard deviations were excluded (n = 3). Finally, a linear regression model was built 749 having connectivity between RdAI and ACCg in other trials as a dependant variable, and the 750 interoception score and other reward beta (equation 6) as predictors. 751\n752\nAcknowledgements 753\nThis work was supported by a grant from the John Templeton Foundation (to MJC) and a 754 Springboard Award (to MJC) from the Academy of Medical Sciences and the Wellcome Trust 755\n(SBF001\\1008); a National Agency for Research and Development (ANID) DOCTORADO BECAS 756 CHILE/2016 \u2013 72170287 (to LSCH); and a Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council 757 David Phillips Fellowship (BB/R010668/1; BB/R010668/2) (to MAJA). 758\n759\nCompeting Interest 760\nThe authors declare no competing interest. 761\n762\nReferences 763\n1.
