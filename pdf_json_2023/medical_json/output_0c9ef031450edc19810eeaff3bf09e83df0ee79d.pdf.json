    "abstractText": "Due to the absence of specific interactions, carbosilane dendrimers are ideal models to study the effect of a hyperbranched regular structure on the molecular response to external influences. In this work, we have studied the conformational behavior of single polybutylcarbosilane dendrimers under confinement between impermeable flat surfaces using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Dendrimers of different generations belonging to two homologous series with a tetra-functional core and threeand four-functional branches were simulated. The analysis of the dependence of the internal energy of the dendrimers on the wall distance allowed us to determine the critical degree of compression at which the dendrimers are able to change their shape without energy loss. The effects of generation number and branching functionality on the number of wall contacts, density distribution and shape changes were elucidated. It was found that for high generation dendrimers, the inner layers are not accessible for external interaction. It was shown that the excess stresses occurring at high compressions are concentrated in the structural center of the dendrimer. The nature of the elastic response, which is strongly nonlinear, was analyzed at different compressions depending on the dendrimer architecture and generation. We believe that our results are useful for further studies of dendrimer films under compression and can also serve as a basis for developing model concepts to describe the dynamics of dendrimer melts.",

            "text": "Dendrimers are hyperbranched synthetic polymers with a regular tree-like structure. The structural parameters of dendrimers are (i) the functionality of the core, i.e., the number of chains branching from the central atom or group of atoms, (ii) the length of the chains (spacers) with multifunctional end groups (branching points), (iii) the functionality of the branching points, and (iv) the generation, i.e., the number of branching layers [1,2]. Due to their specific architecture, these molecules offer a unique combination of monodispersity and high functionality, which are of particular interest for their practical applications as nanocontainers for targeted drug and gene delivery in medicine [3\u20138] and as templates for various methods of polymer characterization [9]. In addition, the practical potential of dendrimers has been greatly enhanced by the ongoing development of synthetic strategies to increase the variety of chemical compositions and structures [10]. In particular, dendrimers are now widely used to create nanoscale hybrid materials with unique electronic/optical/magnetic properties [11\u201313]. Despite a significant amount of work in the field of dendrimers, the fundamental understanding of the structure\u2013property relationships of these highly branched macro-\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4040. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym15204040 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4040 2 of 16\nmolecules is not yet complete, but is crucial for the further development of new materials based on them. So far, the main practical applications have been at the level of individual macromolecules, mainly of low generations, which have the advantages of monodispersity and a tree architecture and, at the same time, do not require laborious and expensive synthesis. Thus, single dendrimer behavior in dilute solutions has been the focus of much theoretical, computer simulation and experimental research, and is now fairly well-understood [14,15]. Not much research has explored the effect of the dendrimer tree-like architecture on the collective properties of dendrimer systems, such as films, concentrated solutions and melts, where dendrimer molecules strongly interact with each other. The experimental results on the melt rheology were reported for polyether [16], poly(propyleneimine) [17], polyamidoamine [18,19] and polybuthylcarbosilane [20] dendrimers. Computer simulation studies within coarse-grained approaches were aimed at a description of basic thermodynamic characteristics of dendrimer melts [21\u201324]. Among a wide variety of chemical compositions of dendrimers, it is worth noting, especially for the class of dendrimers, in which branching occurs due to valence in silicon atoms, namely, carbosilane and siloxane dendrimers [25\u201327], that these dendrimers represent good model systems to study pure effect of tree-like architectures, since they do not contain any groups with specific interactions like, for instance, hydrogen bonding or electrostatic interactions, which contribute a lot into the intermolecular interactions. To date, a large amount of experimental material has been collected on the behavior of polybutylcarbosilane dendrimers in bulk, depending on core and branching functionalities [20,26,28\u201337]. Two fascinating phenomena observed experimentally should be highlighted. First, melts of low-generation dendrimers are liquids, while melts of high-generation dendrimers behave more like solids. The liquid-to-solid transition is realized within one generation step. The \u201ctransition\u201d generation depends on the structural parameters of the dendrimer. It was shown that the transition for the homologous series with tetra-functional core and three-functional branching Si-atoms takes place between the 5th and 6th generations and is accompanied by an enormous (six orders of magnitude) growth of the melt viscosity [20]. Second, a melt of high generations, with a sufficiently accurate preparation, can represent a solid with a well-defined structure; that is, the periodic spatial arrangement of the dendrimers, in particular, crystallization of the G6 dendrimer melt was reported in Ref. [38]. Recent atomistic simulations of carbosilane dendrimer melts [35\u201337] failed to unequivocally identify the physical mechanism of such peculiar behavior of high-generation dendrimer melts due to long relaxation times and the necessity to model big systems, which are time consuming. Simulation studies of the shear-stress relaxation of low-generation functionalized carbosilane dendrimers, i.e., dendrimers with additional branching segments in their structure, have shown the prevalence of the melt elastic response over the viscous one, in which some frequency range of external load and the authors hypnotized that this phenomenon can be caused by a crowded environment due to internal dendrimer densification [39]. The purpose of this work is to study the elastic response of an individual polybutylcarbosilane dendrimer in dependence of its architecture and generation using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. To the best of our knowledge, the conformational behavior of these dendrimers under confinement has not been consistently studied, yet. One can mention only one work [40] that touched this question for some carbosilane dendrimers without any comparative analysis; moreover, the research methodology was different; see the next section. On one hand, since elasticity of an individual molecule controls its many-body behavior, and the study of the single molecule mechanical response can help to elucidate the role of deformation in the dynamics of dendrimer melts and create the basis for the development of a simplified model of a melt. On the other hand, it gives some insight into the tree-like macromolecule behavior in AFM research [41\u201344]. Such studies make it possible to determine the shape and packing of adsorbed dendrimers but fail in connecting them with the internal structure of these molecules. Thus, the results of\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4040 3 of 16\nour simulations can serve as the basis for further studying films and adsorbed layers of dendrimers. In the next section, we describe the research objects and simulation methodology. We start the discussion of the results with the analysis of the potential energy of dendrimers under confinement and determine the range of deformations that do not cause any significant strains in the dendrimer internal structure, and gain some insight in the distribution of strains in highly deformed states. Then, we discuss the stress\u2013strain curves, strain-stiffening effects and the influence of the dendrimer structure and generation on the effective elastic coefficients. The further analysis of the number of contacts of various structural elements of dendrimer molecules with the walls allows us to determine the availability of the dendrimer interior for interactions. The shape changes of the whole dendrimer and its interior and peripheral layers show the conformational variations depending on generation and strain degree. Finally, we calculate the linear and volume density profiles and formulate some conclusions."

The detailed description of the preparation of the initial non-overlapping dendrimer conformations as well as the relaxation of the dendrimer is given in our previous work in this field [37,45,46]. In all simulations the temperature was fixed at 350 K. All simulations were carried out using the GROMACS 2020.1 software package [47\u201350]. Initially, a single dendrimer was placed in a fairly large rectangular modelling cell. Along the Z-axis, the initial distance from the atoms at the periphery of the dendrimer to the cell boundary was 0.2 nm; along the other two axes, it was equal to at least one size of the dendrimer. Periodic boundary conditions were applied in the X and Y directions, while the cell boundaries along the Z axis were represented by impenetrable walls. Interactions of all dendrimer atoms, regardless of their chemical nature, with the walls, were described by a 9-3 LJ potential, with a parameterization corresponding to methyl particles and a number density of 1 nm\u22123. The cell containing a dendrimer was then deformed along the vertical Z-axis, i.e., the distance between the impenetrable walls was gradually reduced, resulting in compression of the dendrimer in one dimension. Following the methodology developed in [40], the compression rate was first varied from 1.0 nm/ps to 0.06 nm/ps and the energy Ewall of dendrimer interaction with the walls was calculated as a function of wall distance D at each compression rate (Figures 2 and S1). The dependences Ewall (D) appeared to be strongly rate-dependent, although there was an apparent tendency towards saturation. To avoid any uncertainty and to obtain equilibrium dendrimer conformations at each D, the following algorithm was applied. The compression rate was further reduced to 0.002 nm/ps and the resulting conformations of the compressed molecule at different distances between the walls were further equilibrated for 100 ns each. All of the characteristics presented below were obtained by averaging the last 50 ns of the trajectories. The design of this study is shown schematically in Figure 3.

It can be seen that the dendrimers of the homologous series 4-4 have a rather rigid structure. The value of Dmin increases monotonically with the generation number. Furthermore, the critical relative deformations of the dendrimers are quite low; in particular, it is sufficient to compress the 4-4G5 dendrimer by only 10% to cause deformations of the intramolecular bonds. The dendrimers of the homologous series 4-3 are more deformable. This difference can be explained by a denser molecular structure of the homologous 4-4 series due to a higher branching functionality. In addition, this molecular density of the 4-4 series grows faster with generation (see Table 1). As a result, the repulsive part of the van der Waals interaction begins to play a role at smaller relative compressions of the 4-4 dendrimers, and the total energy is minimized by redistribution of potential energy contributions (bonded vs. unbonded) leading to structural deformations. Although formally the model fails in simulations of dendrimer conformations at too high compressions, when too much stress appears in chemical bonds and valence angles, it would be interesting to see in which structural part of the dendrimers the stress occurs.

Thus, the functionality of the branching point plays a crucial role in the mechanical response of dendrimers. It should be noted that the F(D) dependences are strongly non-linear. To characterize this non-linearity, we define the effective tangential elastic coefficient, keff, as the slope of the F(D) curves at different D. The value of keff at each D is calculated as the tree-point average derivative of F(D). The dependences of keff on D are shown in Figure 6b for all dendrimers studies. The empty symbols correspond to the values of k0 realized at small deformations in the linear regime (Figure 6a). For 4-3 series, one can see an almost threeorder increase in the value of keff with decreasing D, i.e., with increasing deformation, before Dmin is reached. This tremendous stress-stiffening effect is observed for dendrimers of all generations studied and can be attributed to their highly branched structure decreasing their conformational freedom in comparison with linear macromolecules."

            "text": "Figure 7 shows the dependences of the relative number Na/N of dendrimer atoms in contact with the walls on the wall distance. The value of Na is calculated as the number of atoms in a thin layer \u2206z = 0.5 nm near the walls. While the absolute number of surface contacts increases in proportion to the total number of atoms in the dendrimer (Figure S4), the relative number of contacts behaves in a more complex way. For wall separations larger than the dendrimer diameter, the value of Na/N tends to zero for more rigid dendrimers, while it takes non-zero values for more deformable dendrimers, these being dendrimers of small generations of both homologous series (4-3G4, 4-3G5, 4-4G3). At intermediate separation, when dendrimer compression occurs, the smallest number of surface contacts is realized for the high-generation dendrimers of the 4-3 series, presumably due to their less dense structure, which can be deformed more easily than that of the larger and stiffer 4-4G4 and 4-4G5. Overall, the relative number of contacts grows faster with dendrimer compression for the 4-3 series than for the 4-4 series. At high compression Na/N tends to unity, in this regime, stresses appear in the dendrimer structure, i.e., in bonds and valence angles. To study the accessibility of the inner layers of the dendrimers for interaction with the walls as a function of D, we calculate the relative number of contacts for each branching layer separately. At low compressions, only the peripheral layer of dendrimers interacts with the surface for all dendrimers under study. For low-generation dendrimers, the inner layers begin to interact with the surface almost simultaneously at a certain critical compression (Figure 7c). In contrast, for high-generation dendrimers and especially for the 4-4 series, the confining surface is inaccessible to the inner part of the dendrimers even at rather high compressions. A separate successive \u201cpunching\u201d of the dendrimer layers with decreasing D can be observed, i.e., intervals of D values where only one layer, or only two layers, etc. is available for interaction with the surface, are quite significant and well separated from each other (Figure 7d). Furthermore, for low-generation dendrimers (G4 and G5 of the 4-3 series and 4-4G3), the atoms of almost all branching layers are available for interaction with the surface before critical compressions are reached. The number of core layers unavailable to wall interaction increases with generation for 4-3 series (these are two layers for 4-3G6 and four layers for 4-3G7), while 4-4G4 and 4-4G5 interact with the walls only through the peripheral layer, without any stress on the internal structure (Figures 7d and S5). In Ref. [37], we performed the comparative analysis of the structure of 4-3 dendrimer melt as a function of generation by atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. We calculated the density distribution profiles and separated two regions in the dendrimer, namely, the peripheral one, which is penetrated by neighboring molecules, and the internal one, which is inaccessible to outsiders. The radius of the internal impermeable region increases significantly with dendrimer generation (Table S1). While G3-G5 dendrimers can interpenetrate almost the entire molecule, the radius of the inner region of G6 and G7 correlates with Dmin being slightly larger than Dmin.\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4040 9 of 16\nPolymers 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 16\n(a) (b)\n(c) (d)\nFigure 7.

Deformations at D/2R > 1 are particularly noticeable for the dendrimers of the soft homologous series 4-3. Despite the fact that at D/2R > 1 the dendrimer does not touch both walls at the same time, it hits one or the other during the movement, leading to its flattening. This effect is also observed for linear polymers under conditions of external constraint [51]. As the stiffness of the dendrimer increases, this effect becomes less pronounced, as for example in 4-4G4 and 4-4G5. In general, we see a monotonic flattening of the dendrimers with decreasing slit size, which is qualitatively the same for all dendrimer types. For a given D < 2R, the value of S correlates well with the stiffness of the dendrimer. Namely, the lower the value of the effective elastic constant, the lower the value of S, i.e., softer dendrimers spread more over the surface when compressed. To study the effect of the compression on the internal structure of the dendrimers, we calculate separately the shape factors for the internal branching layers of the dendrimer, namely, for the layers from 0 to (G-2), and the peripheral layer k(G) (Figure 9). Note that the layer G-1 is not taken into account. It was found that the shape factor of the peripheral layer monotonously decreases with the wall distance D, which coincides with the shape factor behavior of the whole dendrimer and, thus, demonstrating a flattening of the dendrimer as a whole. However, by comparing the S(D) dependences of the inner and peripheral layers, we found that under moderate compressions, the core region of the dendrimer flattens more than the periphery, which is typical of all the dendrimers studied (an example is shown in Figure 9b). Furthermore, for softer dendrimers (G3\u2013G6 of the 4- 3 series and G3 of the 4-4 series) an opposite tendency is observed at high compressions, i.e., the peripheral layer appears flatter. The non-monotonic dependence of the shape factor of the core region was observed for the 4-4G3 dendrimer. It should also be noted that the shape fluctuations of the peripheral layer are mostly hindered by interactions with the walls, while the shape of the inner layers fluctuates to a large extent, so that it can adopt both prolate and oblate conformations at low compressions.\nFigure 8.

This effect is also observed for lin ar polymers under co ditions of external constraint [51]. As the stiffness of the dendrimer increases, this effect becomes less pronounced, as for xampl in 4-4G4 and 4-4G5. In g neral, we see a monotonic flatteni g of the dendri ers with decreasing slit size, which is qualitatively the same for all dendrimer types. For a given D < 2R, the value of S correlates well with the stiffness of the dendrimer. Namely, the lower the value of the effective elastic constant, the lower the value of S, i.e., softer dendrimers spread more over the surface when compressed. To study the effect of the compression on the internal structure of the dendrimers, we calculate separately the shape factors for the internal branching layers of the dendrimer, namely, for the layers from 0 to (G-2), and the peripheral layer k(G) (Figure 9). Note that the layer G-1 is not taken into account. It was found that the shape factor of the peripheral layer monotonously decreases with the wall distance D, which coincides with the shape factor behavior of the whole dendrimer and, thus, demonstrating a flattening of the dendrimer as a whole. However, by comparing the S(D) dependences of the inner and peripheral layers, we found that under moderate compressions, the core region of the dendrimer flattens more than the periphery, which is typical of all the dendrimers studied (an xample is shown in Figure 9b). F rthermore, for softer dendrimers (G3\u2013G6 of 4-3 se ies a d G3 of the 4-4 series) an opposite tendency is observed at high ompressions, i.e., the peripheral layer appears flatter. The non-monotonic dependence of the shape factor of the core region was observed for the 4-4G3 dendrimer. It should also be noted that the shape fluctuations of the peripheral layer are mostly hindered by interactions with the walls, while the shape of the inner layers fluctuates to a large extent, so that it can adopt both prolate and oblate conformations at low compressions.\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4040 11 of 16 Polymers 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 16\n(a) (b)\n(c) (d)\nFigure 9.

            "text": "Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of single polybutylcarbosilane dendrimers confined between two impenetrable planar surfaces were carried out. The distance D between the surfaces was varied in a wide range, so that the degree of dendrimer compressio varied from light (D/2R~1, where R is the effective radius of a de drimer) to strong (D/2R << 1). Equilibrium dendrimer conformations were obtain d t each D/2R. Dendrimers with the functionality of the central Si atom equal to 4, belonging to two homol-\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4040 13 of 16\nogous series differing in the functionality of the branched Si atoms (3 and 4), were studied. For the 4-4 series, the dendrimers were simulated from the 3rd to the 5th generation, while for the 4-3 series, the dendrimer generation was varied from the 4th to the 7th generation. The comparative analysis of the dendrimer behavior under compression allowed us to elucidate the effect of the generation number and branching functionality on the elastic response as well as on the internal structure of polybutylcarbosilane dendrimers. The critical degree of dendrimer compression has been found, above which significant stresses in chemical bonds and valence angles occur. Dendrimers of the 4-3 series can be compressed to 60\u201370% of their original size in the free state without internal deformation. At the same time, the chemical structure of the denser 4-4 dendrimers is more sensitive to deformation. Even the smallest 3rd generation dendrimer is stressed at less than 60% strain, while the 5th generation dendrimer can only deform 10% without disturbing the bond and valence angle equilibrium. At small compressions, only the peripheral layer of dendrimers interacts with the confining walls. A decrease in the wall distance causes an increase in the number of contacts of the inner layers of the dendrimers with the confining surfaces. At critical compressions for the 4-3 series, atoms of almost all branching layers interact with the walls. In contrast, the inner layers of the 4-4G4 and 4-4G5 dendrimers are not accessible for external interaction. The elastic response of all dendrimers investigated is strongly non-linear. It has been shown that a higher density of the molecular structure realized for 4-4 series due to the higher branching functionality results in (i) much larger values of the effective elastic constant, k, of these dendrimers compared to those for the 4-3 series and (ii) a tremendous growth of k with generation. In particular, only a fourfold increase in the effective coefficient is observed from G4 to G7 generations of the 4-3 series. At the same time, the k-value of the 5th generation of 4-4 dendrimers is more than an order of magnitude larger than that of the 3rd generation and it is an order of magnitude larger than the elastic modulus of the largest 4-3G7. A strain-stiffening effect is very pronounced for all dendrimers, it manifests itself in an almost three-orders of magnitude increase in the effective elastic constant with deformation. It was found that the effect of the confinement on the dendrimer conformations begins to appear at distances between compression planes exceeding the size of the dendrimer. The lower the dendrimer generation, the larger the deviation of the dendrimer shape from the spherical shape at D/2R = 1. At larger compressions, disc-like conformations of dendrimers are realized. The value of the sphericity parameter S correlates well with the dendrimer rigidity, i.e., softer dendrimers spread more over the surface when compressed. The sphericity parameter of the peripheral layer follows the behavior of S for the whole dendrimer while the shape of the core region of the dendrimer fluctuates to a large extent, so that it can adopt both prolate and oblate conformations at small compressions. It has been shown that the density profile changes from a standard bell-shaped one with a maximum at the center of the slit to the one characterized by an almost constant value decreasing to zero at the walls. It was demonstrated that excess stresses occurring at high compressions are concentrated in the structural center of the dendrimer. The work carried out helps to deepen the understanding of the behavior of dendrimer molecules under spatial restrictions.\nSupplementary Materials: The following are available online at https://www.mdpi.com/article/10 .3390/polym15204040/s1, Figure S1: Interaction energy of dendrimers with the walls for different compression rates and for slits of static size, Figure S2: Distribution of bond lengths for 4-4G5 and 4-3G7 for uncompressed conformations and at D/2R = 0.38, Figure S3: Dependence of the force of dendrimer interaction with the walls on the distance between them, Figure S4: The absolute number of surface contacts, Table S1: The size of the internal region of dendrimers, Rcore, inaccessible to neighbors in melts, and its relative values, Rcore/2R, 2R = 2Rg \u00d7 (5/3)0.5, Figure S5: Dependence of the relative number of dendrimer atoms belonging to the k-layer in contact with the walls on the\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4040 14 of 16\nrelative wall distance, Figure S6: Density profiles along the z-axis calculated in the cylindrical region of the radius Rg/2 at different D/2R as indicated.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, E.Y.K.; methodology, N.K.B. and E.Y.K.; software, N.K.B. and A.O.K.; formal analysis, A.O.K.; investigation, A.O.K., N.K.B., K.A.L. and E.Y.K.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, A.O.K.; writing\u2014review and editing, E.Y.K. and A.O.K.; supervision, E.Y.K.; funding acquisition, E.Y.K.
