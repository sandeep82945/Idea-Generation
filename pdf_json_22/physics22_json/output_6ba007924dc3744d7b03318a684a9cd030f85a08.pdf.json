    "abstractText": "Superdirective arrays have been extensively studied because of their considerable potential accompanied, unfortunately, by a high sensitivity to random errors that affect the responses and positions of array elements. However, the statistics of their actual beam pattern (BP) has never been systematically investigated. This paper shows that the Rician probability density function (PDF), sometimes adopted to study the impact of errors in conventional arrays, is a valid approximation for superdirective BP statistics only where some mathematical terms are negligible. The paper also shows that this is the case for all linear end-fire arrays considered. A similar study is proposed concerning the correlation between BP lobes, showing that for the superdirective arrays considered the lobes, especially non-adjacent ones, are almost independent. Furthermore, knowledge of the PDF of the actual BP allows one to define quantile BP functions, whose probability of being exceeded, at any point, is fixed. Combining the lobes\u2019 independence with quantile BP functions, an empirical equation for the probability that the entire actual BP will not exceed a quantile function over an interval larger than a given size is obtained. This new knowledge and these tools make it possible to devise new methods to design robust superdirective arrays via optimization goals with clearer and more relevant statistical meaning.",

INTRODUCTION\nIN DATA-INDEPENDENT beamforming [1], superdirectiv-ity theory (also called supergain) is often used [2]\u2013[5] when the array aperture is comparable to or less than the wavelength. In this condition, uniform and side-lobe reduction weighting windows produce very limited directivity.1 To improve performance, superdirective techniques allow the synthesis of weighting windows that increase the directivity, for a given array layout, subject to specific constraints. Special advantages are predicted for linear arrays steered at end-fire (i.e., along the array baseline) because this particular pointing has a maximum (theoretical) directivity of N2 (N being the number of sensors) [4], [6], [7]. As an example, Fig. 1(a) compares the BPs of an 8-element end-fire linear array, with an inter-element spacing of 0.3\u03bb (\u03bb being\nManuscript received September 28, 2021; revised January 26, 2022 and February 28, 2022; accepted March 1, 2022.

The main research aim is to combine the increase in directivity with the reduction in robustness against spatially uncorrelated noise and random errors. Indeed, the nominal beam pattern (NBP, i.e., the one obtained in the absence of noise and errors) often differs significantly from the actual beam pattern (ABP, i.e., the one of a specific array realization, impacted by errors). To deal with this problem, many methods have been proposed to synthesize superdirective weighting windows capable of balancing an increased directivity with a sufficient robustness. Constrained optimization\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

However, in the superdirectivity field, little attention has been paid to the complete characterization of the ABP, neglecting to deepen the knowledge of its PDF and to use it, on the one hand, to analyze the behavior of the superdirective array with respect to errors, on the other hand, to guide the optimization task.\nThe effect of random errors in data-independent beamforming with conventional arrays has been investigated for many decades [1], [5], [23]\u2013[34], leading to equations for the calculation of the moments of the ABP (or of specific ABP portions, especially the side-lobe region) and, with different levels of approximation, to knowledge of the PDF of the ABP modulus. In many cases the studies are limited to gain and phase errors, considered constant with respect to frequency, neglecting errors in the positions of the array elements. Regarding the PDF of errors, previous studies have often been conducted exclusively for the Gaussian case or for the uniform case. Equally often, the analyses are exclusively referred to specific geometries, namely the equispaced linear or planar array. In this context, some authors [5], [23], [25], [26], [30], [31], [34] have shown that, under working conditions that are common for a conventional array, the PDF of the ABP modulus can be approximated by a Rician function. Furthermore, to calculate the probability that the side-lobe peak exceeds a given level, the Rician PDF was used assuming, in addition to the above-mentioned assumptions, the independence between the effects of random errors on different lobes [25], [26].\nUnfortunately, the assumptions used in the past to show that the Rician PDF is a valid approximation for the statistics of the ABP modulus (in particular, real-valued weight coefficients, symmetric with respect to the array center [25], [30]) are not valid for superdirective arrays, where the weight coefficients are generally complex-valued and the white-noise gain (WNG)2 markedly decreases. The first contribution of this paper is the analytical study of the terms that must be neglected for the ABP modulus to have Rician statistics, without introducing any constraints on the array geometry and comprising gain, phase and position errors for every sensor. In addition, the impact of the PDFs most commonly adopted to describe such errors is investigated. After identifying the equations of the terms that prevent the perfect \u201cRicianity\u201d (equations valid for any kind of array), the paper shows that these terms are negligible for a number of linear end-fire arrays made superdirective through constrained optimization. The Ricianity of their ABPs is also verified with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) hypothesis test.\nKnowledge of ABP modulus statistics allows this paper to introduce the quantile BP function, whose value, at a given arrival direction, will be exceeded by the ABP modulus with a known probability. Furthermore, the paper studies the independence\n2The WNG is the improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio obtained using the array and considering spatially uncorrelated noise; a kind of noise whose effect is similar to that of array errors.\nbetween two points of the ABP, again without assumptions on the array geometry and without neglecting any of the error types already considered. The solutions of the mathematical expectations obtained assuming Gaussian spherical symmetry in position errors are applied to the linear superdirective arrays mentioned above, showing that the lobes of their ABPs are almost independent, especially non-adjacent ones. Finally, the relative frequency with which the ABP exceeds a quantile BP function, as a function of the size (in terms of angular interval) of the overrun, is analyzed using an empirical approach. Combining the outcomes of this analysis with the independence between lobes, a simple equation is proposed to approximate the probability that no overrun of the quantile BP function occurs with a size greater than a given value. The validity of this equation is assessed through numerical experimentation.\nAs described above, this paper introduces new knowledge regarding the statistics of BPs that characterize superdirective arrays. The importance of this new knowledge is twofold. On the one hand, mathematical tools are provided to test whether the Ricianity assumption for the PDF of the ABP modulus is acceptable, given the array geometry, the weight coefficients and the statistics of random errors. Where the Ricianity assumption is valid, the procedure to find an empirical equation for the probability that there are no overruns larger than a fixed size of a quantile BP function is shown. Unlike numerical assessments, the validity of these tools and procedures is not limited to the superdirective case, but is general. On the other hand, because of the peculiar importance of linear end-fire arrays [4], [6] in the field of superdirectivity, this paper confirms the Ricianity of their ABPs and opens the possibility of evaluating the robustness of a specific design by the quantile BP functions and the probability of no overruns larger than a fixed size. Furthermore, the quantile BP function (which depends on the parameters of the Rician PDF) can be adopted as the optimization target in new methods for designing robust superdirective arrays, for which the probability of exceeding a certain level is known.\nThis paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces the data model. Section III investigates the statistics of the ABP modulus, the possibility of adopting a Rician PDF and the related quantile functions. In Section IV the impact of different PDFs for random errors is analyzed and, then, used in Section V to numerically assess the validity of the Rician approximation and the relevance of the quantile functions. Section VI studies the correlation and independence between the BP lobes. Finally, Section VII explores the size of the overruns of a given quantile BP function, with the related probability. Some conclusions are drawn in Section VIII. Overall, the paper is organized into two parts: in the first (Sections II to V) Ricianity is studied and quantile functions are introduced; in the second (Sections VI and VII) the independence between side lobes is investigated and the probability of no overruns larger than a certain size is derived."

On the one hand, the gain error is assumed such that \u039bl(f) = [1 + \u03b4g,l(f)] > 0, assuring in this way that the actual gain gl(f) is not negative and greater than zero. On the other hand, it is reasonable to assume that \u039bl(f) = [1 + \u03b4g,l(f)] < K < \u221e, where K is a finite constant, arbitrarily high.\nLet us consider a plane wave with wavefronts perpendicular to the unit vector u\u0302 impinging on the array, as sketched in Fig. 1(b). If s0(t) is the signal present at the origin of the coordinates, then the signal present at the generic position p is s(t,p) = s0(t+ p \u00b7 u\u0302/c), where c is the wave propagation speed. Therefore, the l-th element of the array produces an electrical signal ql(t) whose spectrum is\nQl (f) = Al (f) S0 (f) exp (jk pl \u00b7 u\u0302) (4) where k is the wavenumber, k = 2\u03c0f/c, and S0(f) is the Fourier transform of s0(t).\nA far-field data-independent beamforming [1] that processes actual signals and is steered in the direction of the unit vector u\u03020 (which is defined by the steering angles \u03b10 and \u03c70) produces an output beam signal d(t) whose spectrum is\nD (f) = N\u2211 l=1 wl (f)Ql (f) exp (\u2212jk pnl \u00b7 u\u03020) (5)\nwhere wl(f) is the complex-valued weight coefficient for the element l, at frequency f (see Fig. 1(b)).

To simplify the notation, when suitable, the dependence of the previous variables on f and u\u0302 will be omitted.\nAssumption 1: The array elements have the same statistics. The PDFs \u03b2\u03b5x(\u03b5x), \u03b2\u03b5y (\u03b5y), \u03b2\u03b5z (\u03b5z), \u03b2\u03b4\u03d5(\u03b4\u03d5) and \u03b2\u03b4g (\u03b4g) are the functions that describe all the RVs \u03b5x,l, \u03b5y,l, \u03b5z,l, \u03b4\u03d5,l, \u03b4g,l, l = 1, \u2026, N, respectively.\nAssumption 2: Statistical independence. All the RVs \u03b5x,l, \u03b5y,l, \u03b5z,l, \u03b4\u03d5,l, \u03b4g,l, l = 1, \u2026, N, are statistically independent; thus, all their joint PDFs are separable functions.3\nAssumption 3: PDF symmetry. The PDFs \u03b2\u03b5x(\u03b5x), \u03b2\u03b5y (\u03b5y), \u03b2\u03b5z (\u03b5z) and \u03b2\u03b4\u03d5(\u03b4\u03d5) are even functions. This assumption is not applied to \u03b2\u03b4g (\u03b4g).\nIn addition, the errors \u03b5x,l, \u03b5y,l, \u03b5z,l, \u03b4\u03d5,l, \u03b4g,l, l = 1, \u2026, N, are assumed to be RVs of continuous type.\nThe modulus of the ABP, |B| =\u221aB2R +B2I , has Rician PDF with distance parameter \u03bd and scale parameter \u03c3 [35] if the three following conditions are satisfied:\n3The statistical moments of the ABP modulus in the presence of correlated random errors, as well as the directivity reduction and steering direction fluctuation, have been investigated in [27], [28], [33].\n(i) BR is a Gaussian RV with mean value equal to \u03bdcos\u03be and variance equal to \u03c32;\n(ii) BI is a Gaussian RV with mean value equal to \u03bdsin\u03be and variance equal to \u03c32;\n(iii) BR and BI are independent RVs; where \u03be is any real number. More specifically, the Rician PDF of a RV p is defined as\n\u03b2p (p) = p\n\u03c32 exp (\u2212p2 \u2212 \u03bd2 2\u03c32 ) I0 (p\u03bd \u03c32 ) (14)\nwhere I0 is the modified Bessel function of the first kind with order zero. The corresponding cumulative distribution function (CDF), Fp(p), is defined as\nFp (p) = 1\u2212Q1 (\u03bd \u03c3 , p \u03c3 ) (15)\nwhere Q1 is the Marcum Q-function. Equations (12) and (13) show that BR and BI are the sums of N terms, each of which is a function of the random errors that affect the l-th element. Since the errors affecting different array elements are independent RVs of continuous type, the N terms in the sums represent independent RVs of continuous type. The PDFs of such terms are not known and, in general, different from each other. Since the gain and phase dispersion is unavoidable for real transducers, for each term there exists a constant \u03d6 such that the term\u2019s variance is greater than \u03d6. In addition, because it was assumed that 0 < \u039bl(f) < K and because \u039bnl (f) is also greater than zero and bounded from the above, all the PDFs of the N terms in (12) and (13) are equal to zero outside a finite interval [0, A), A being a finite constant, no matter how large. According to [36], under these conditions the central limit theorem can be applied to independent not-identically distributed RVs. Therefore, the PDF of BR and BI is approximately Gaussian for a sufficiently great number of elements N. For the same reason, the PDF of every linear combination of BR and BI is also approximately Gaussian. Thus, BR and BI can be assumed to be jointly Gaussian RVs; the same conclusion already achieved in [5], [23], [25].\nThe requirements on the mean values of BR and BI (denoted by BR and BI , respectively) are satisfied because BR and BI are the real and imaginary parts of the mean value, B, of the ABP function given in (7). In particular, one can observe that \u03bd = |B|.\nTo verify the remaining requirements settled by the conditions (i), (ii) and (iii), it is necessary to achieve compact equations for the mean powers of BR and BI, as well as for BR and BI .\nBy indicating the expectation operator with E{.}, the mean power of BR can be written\nB2R = E { B2R } = \u0398R1 +\u0398 R 2 (16)\nwhere\n\u0398R1 = E { N\u2211 l=1 (\u039bnl ) 2\u039b2l cos 2 (\u03a6nl +\u03a6l) } (17)\n\u0398R2 = E { N\u2211 l=1 N\u2211 m=1,m =l \u039bnl \u039b n m\u039bl\u039bmcos (\u03a6 n l +\u03a6l)\n\u00b7 cos (\u03a6nm +\u03a6m) }\n(18)\nProposition 1: Under Assumptions 1, 2 and 3, the terms \u0398R1 and \u0398R2 , used in (16) to compute the mean power of BR, can be written as follows\n\u0398R1 = \u039b 2\n2 N\u2211 l=1 (\u039bnl ) 2 + \u039b 2 2 \u03bc2\u0398 N\u2211 l=1 (\u039bnl ) 2cos2\u03a6nl (19)\n\u0398R2 = \u039b 2 \u03bc2\u0398 N\u2211 l=1 N\u2211 m=1,m =l \u039bnl \u039b n m cos\u03a6 n l cos\u03a6 n m (20)\nwhere\n\u039b = E {\u039bl} = 1 + \u03b4g, \u039b > 0 (21) \u039b 2 = E { \u039b2l } = 1 + 2\u03b4g + \u03b42g (22)\n\u03bc\u0398 = E {cos\u03a6l} = E {cos (\u03b4\u03d5,l)}E {cos (k \u03b5l \u00b7 u\u0302)} (23) \u03bc2\u0398 = E {cos (2\u03a6l)} = E {cos (2\u03b4\u03d5,l)}E {cos (2k \u03b5l \u00b7 u\u0302)}\n(24)\n\u03b4g and \u03b42g are the mean value and mean power, respectively, of the RV \u03b4g,l, l = 1, \u2026, N.

More in general, the dependence on u\u0302 is avoided for any spherically symmetric PDF of the position errors \u03b5l. According to [3], assuming the statistics of the position errors \u03b5l has a spherical symmetry and is the same for all the array elements, Appendix C demonstrates that\nE {cos (k\u03b5l \u00b7 u\u0302)} = \u222b \u221e 0 sinc ( kr \u03c0 ) \u03b2r (r) dr (59)\nE {cos (2k\u03b5l \u00b7 u\u0302)} = \u222b \u221e 0 sinc ( 2kr \u03c0 ) \u03b2r (r) dr (60)\nwhere r is modulus of the error vector \u03b5l and \u03b2r(r) is the PDF of such a RV. As anticipated above, the two integrals do not depend on u\u0302.

The elements are assumed to be point-like and omnidirectional, placed at the nominal positions pnl = [0, 0, dl \u2212 d(N + 1)/2], l = 1, \u2026, N, where d is the interelement spacing. Without any loss of generality their nominal gains gnl are set equal to one and their nominal phases \u03d5 n l are set equal to zero. Given that for a linear array placed on the z-axis the polar angle \u03c7 represents the grazing angle, as visible in Fig. 1(b), the broadside angle \u03b8 can be defined as\n\u03b8 = \u03c0\n2 \u2212 \u03c7, (61)\nand the NBP depends only on \u03b8, irrespective of \u03b1. Because the focus here is primarily on the statistics of superdirective BPs, the steering direction is set at end-fire (i.e., \u03b80 = 90\u00b0) where the maximum amount of superdirectivity is obtained [4], [6], [7]. An example of superdirective end-fire BP is shown in Fig. 1(a).\nConcerning the complex weight coefficients wl used for the beamforming operation, for a given combination between N and d/\u03bb (\u03bb being the wavelength, \u03bb= c/f), they are computed through the maximization of the directivity subject to a constraint on the minimum value of the WNG. This constrained optimization is a classical approach to achieve robust superdirective performance, as described in [1], [4], [19]. More in detail, the directivity and WNG can be written in matrix form by defining a column vector w for which the l-th element is w[l] = wl, l = 1, 2, \u2026, N, and a square matrix Q for which the element in the l-th row and m-th column is:\nQ [l,m] = exp [jk (znl \u2212 znm)] sinc [k (znm \u2212 znl )/\u03c0] (62) Using this notation, the directivity, D, and WNG, G, can be\ndefined [1], [22] as follows\nD = |Bn (\u03b80)|2 ( 1\n2 \u222b \u03c0 0 |Bn (\u03b8)|2 sin \u03b8d\u03b8 )\u22121 = wHJw wHQw\n(63)\nG = |Bn (\u03b80)|2 (\nN\u2211 l=1\n|wl|2 )\u22121 = wHJw\nwHw (64)\nwhere H indicates the complex-conjugate transpose and J is a square matrix of ones of size N. Following a common practice,\nthe lower bound for the WNG is set equal to 0 dB and the optimization is performed by solving a quadratically constrained quadratic program by a convex optimization tool [22]. The WNG constraint is not only used for data-independent beamforming; it has also been used to improve the robustness of data-dependent beamforming techniques [38], e.g., the norm-constrained Capon beamforming [39], also referred to as minimum variance distortionless response beamforming with WNG constraint [40]. In these techniques, the matrix Q is replaced by the covariance matrix of the array signals. The data-dependent solution is equivalent to the data-independent one if an isotropic noise field is assumed to be the only signal that impinges on the array.\nEight combinations among N, d/\u03bb, and the random errors\u2019 statistics are considered. Table I contains the values related to each combination (from C-1 to C-8) and Table II describes the characteristics of the two sets of PDFs, S1 and S2, that are adopted to model the random errors. In particular, the standard deviation for the position errors \u03c3\u03b5 is expressed in terms of the wavelength \u03bb. This means that the accuracy of the element placement increases when the wavelength decreases. In other words, if the frequency increases, the inter-element spacing decreases (because d/\u03bb is set to be constant) and a better geometrical precision in the elements\u2019 placement is expected. Table III reports the nominal directivity [1] achieved by the robust superdirective beamforming (optimum weight coefficients) in comparison with the directivity achieved using uniform weight coefficients. For the four combinations of N and d/\u03bb considered, the directivity increase provided by optimum weights is between 5.1 and 6.4 dB.\nTABLE III DIRECTIVITY OF THE END-FIRE NBP OBTAINED WITH UNIFORM WEIGHTS AND OPTIMUM WEIGHTS (MAX. DIRECTIVITY WITH A 0 dB WNG LOWER BOUND). FOUR COMBINATIONS OF N AND d/\u03bb ARE CONSIDERED\nFig. 2. Normalized difference, \u0394, between the variances of the real and imaginary parts of the ABP, for (up) 8-element and (down) 16-element end-fire linear arrays.\nB. Validity of the Rician Approximation\nThe normalized difference between the two variances, \u0394, is displayed in Fig. 2 as a function of the incidence angle \u03b8 (irrespective of \u03b1). The increase of the error magnitude (i.e., moving from S1 to S2) and the increase of the ratio d/\u03bb (i.e., moving from 0.05 to 0.3) weakly raise the maximum of the \u0394 absolute value. In any case, for the eight combinations considered, the maximum of the \u0394 absolute value does not exceed 0.053 (for C-4 and \u03b8=\u221218\u00b0). The correlation coefficient between the ABP real and imaginary parts, \u03c1, is displayed in Fig. 3. For the eight combinations considered the \u03c1 absolute value does not exceed 4\u00b710\u221210. Recalling that the real and imaginary parts of the ABP tend to be Gaussian as N increase, the very small values assumed by their correlation coefficient allow one to consider BR and BI as independent RVs, supporting the adoption of the Rician statistics for the ABP modulus. Overall, the main obstacle to the adoption of the Rician statistics is the difference between the variances of BR and BI. Although such a difference is limited, it cannot be considered fully negligible.\nTo verify that, despite the deviations from the conditions (i)-(iii), the Rician PDF is a suitable approximation for the\nstatistics of the ABP modulus, attention is focused on the combination C-4. Fig. 1(a) shows the NBP modulus obtained with superdirective weights in comparison with that obtained with uniform weights. Both superdirective and uniform weights are normalized in such a way that the maximum of the NBP modulus is one. Assuming the PDF set S2 for the statistics of errors, the scale parameter \u03c3 for the Rician PDF is 0.204 (independent of \u03b8) and the distance parameter \u03bd is equal to the NBP modulus [see (45)] scaled by the factor \u039b|\u03bc\u0398|. The latter is 0.978, independent of \u03b8. Based on these data, a Rician PDF for each point of the ABP modulus can be established. Fig. 1(a) shows also the mean value of the Rician RV as a function of the incidence angle, expressed in logarithmic scale, avoiding any additional normalization. Fig. 4 shows the Rician PDFs computed for the combination C-4 at three incidence angles: \u03b8 = \u221218\u00b0, \u03b8 = 65\u00b0 and \u03b8 = 90\u00b0. According to Fig. 1(a), these angles represent three different conditions for the statistics of the ABP modulus, i.e., low, intermediate and high nominal levels, respectively. Moreover, the condition C-4 and \u03b8 = \u221218\u00b0 identifies the maximum of the \u0394 absolute value, as shown in Fig. 2. The Rician PDF moves from a profile close to the Rayleigh PDF (\u03b8 = \u221218\u00b0) to a profile close to the Gaussian PDF (\u03b8 = 90\u00b0). These PDFs are compared with the histograms computed from 106 independent realizations of the ABP for the combination C-4, using 100 quantization intervals uniformly spanning the interval [0, 2]. The relative frequency of each interval is divided by the quantization step, obtaining in this way histograms with total area equal to one. Very good matching can be observed between the PDFs and the related histograms.\nA further and more general assessment is performed through the Kolmogoroff-Smirnov (KS) hypothesis test [36]. For each combination, from C-1 to C-8, a number G of independent realizations of the ABP, at a given incidence angle \u03b8, are computed. The H0 hypothesis is that the sample of size G is from a Rician CDF whose parameters \u03bd and \u03c3 are given by (45) and (46). This hypothesis is rejected if the KS statistic, q, is larger than the critical value, qcv, which is a function of the significance level (set equal to 0.05) and the sample size G [36]. Specifically, the sample size G is set equal to 103, the generation of the sample is repeated 102 times and the KS test is carried out for each sample. In addition, this procedure is performed for \u03b8 ranging from\u221290\u00b0 to 90\u00b0, with steps of 5\u00b0. Fig. 5 shows the average of q, compared with the critical value qcv. Fig. 6 shows the relative frequency for which the H0 hypothesis is not rejected by the KS test. One can observe that the average of the test statistic q always stays well below its critical value and the non-rejection percentage for the H0 hypothesis is always greater than 94%. The latter outcome is coherent with the significance level equal to 0.05, which expresses the probability of rejecting the H0 hypothesis when the sample is really taken from a Rician CDF. Therefore, for the eight array combinations examined, the Rician density represents a good approximation of their ABP modulus PDF."

An example for the combinations C-2 and C-4 is shown in Fig. 7, where 20log[|Bn(u\u0302)|], 10log[|B(u\u0302)|2], 20log[|B(u\u0302)|] and 20log[Bq,0.50(u\u0302)] are compared, avoiding any normalization. The modulus of the mean ABP, |B(u\u0302)|, is not considered because it is almost overlapped on the modulus of the NBP, |Bn(u\u0302)|, as already observed. In both panels of Fig. 7, the mean value and median value of the ABP modulus are very close each other: the maximum distance is in the side-lobe region and does not exceed 0.6 dB. In the main lobe region, where the Rician PDF tends to become a Gaussian function (see Fig. 4(c)), the median and mean values are almost equal. In dB scale, the ABP mean power is slightly higher than the mean of the ABP modulus: in the side-lobe region the two curves have an almost constant distance of approximately 1 dB. It has been verified that these observations also hold for the combinations other than C-2 and C-4. Thus, the ABP mean power profile is very similar to that of the mean value of the ABP modulus, although in the side-lobe region a small difference is observed.\nFigs. 8 and 9 show the quantile functions Bq,0.90(u\u0302) and Bq,0.99(u\u0302) for the arrays with 8 and 16 elements, respectively, in comparison with the NBP and the mean value of the ABP modulus.

            "text": "This subsection evaluates two superdirective weighting windows for the C-3 end-fire array, obtained from the constrained optimization procedure described in Section V.A. Specifically, the directivity is maximized with the lower bound for the WNG set at two different values: \u22125 dB and 5 dB. The NBPs achieved\nwith the two weighting windows are compared in Fig. 10(a): the NBP obtained with the lower bound set to \u22125 dB is definitely more directive, having narrower main-lobe and comparable sidelobe level. However, it is less robust to random errors than the NBP obtained with the lower-bound set to 5 dB. Conventionally, the impact of errors is assessed through the ABP mean power (frequently referred to as EBPP). Fig 10(b) compares the EBPPs for the two array designs and shows that the more robust design (WNG \u2265 5 dB) presents a noticeable lower side-lobe level, but its main-lobe width remains larger than that obtained by the less robust design (WNG \u2265 \u22125 dB). While the less robust design seems to assure a better resolution, the more robust design seems to allow a better attenuation of interfering signals. When the quantile functions are inspected, the appraisal changes. Fig. 10(c) compares the two quantile functions with \u03b3 = 0.90. Recalling that the probability that the ABP modulus exceeds the quantile function, at each point of the horizontal axis, is 1\u2013\u03b3, it is interesting to note that both the quantile functions cross the \u22123 dB level (which determines the main-lobe width) for \u03b8 close to 66\u00b0. Hence, the two designs have the same probability (specifically 10%) of exceeding such a level at about the same angle \u03b8.\nRecalling that the EBPP is very similar to the mean value of the ABP modulus (as observed in the previous subsection), one can conclude that, although the ABP modulus of the less robust design has, around \u03b8 = 66\u00b0, a mean value lower than that of the more robust design, its variance is higher. It is evident that, to be effective, an array design procedure should consider not only the mean value of the ABP modulus (i.e., the EBPP), but also the variance. The quantile functions encompass all these aspects because they allow one to design superdirective BPs with a known (low) probability of exceeding a given profile. In this light, a design procedure which optimizes a given quantile function of the ABP modulus should be considered more meaningful than a procedure which optimizes the EBPP.\nVI. INDEPENDENCE BETWEEN SIDE LOBES\nThe probability that the modulus of the ABP exceeds the quantile function Bq,\u03b3(u\u0302) at a given direction u\u0302 is (1 \u2013 \u03b3). This property refers to a single point of the BP and does not provide any information on the statistical relationship between different BP points nor on the probability that the ABP exceeds the quantile function in more than one point. Main-lobe width (often measured at \u22123 dB) and side-lobe level are considered key performance in array systems that use beamforming as processing algorithm [1], [5], [12], [32], [34]. While the width of the main lobe is related to angular resolution, the level of the side lobes ensures the attenuation of signals coming from directions away from the steering direction. To obtain the expected attenuation, it is important to verify, in probabilistic terms, that no lobe exceeds the desired level over a significant angular interval. In fact, it is not the overrun of the desired level in single points that degrades significantly the performance, but rather the presence of even a single overrun that extends over a non-negligible size interval. Unfortunately, quantile functions do not provide per se any information on the number of overruns or their size.\nTo deepen this matter, as a first step, this section investigates the potential independence between the ABP at two arrival directions, namely B(u\u03021) and B(u\u03022). If the BP lobes are independent of each other, the statistical study of the overruns could be conducted focusing on individual lobes. Based on the conclusions reached in this section, the next section will propose an empirical approach to compute the probability of no overrun, with a size larger than a known value, of a given quantile function. Such a probability represents useful information in assessing the ability of a superdirective array to fulfill the task for which it was designed.\nFor notational simplicity, let us indicate B(u\u03021) and B(u\u03022) with B1 and B2, respectively, and let us define their real and imaginary parts as follows: B1 = BR1 + jBI1 and B2 = BR2 + jBI2 . Moreover, let us define a two-dimensional complex random vector b = [B1, B2]T , where T indicates the transpose.\nB1 and B2 are independent complex RVs if the following three conditions are satisfied [41], [42]:\n(j) BR1 , BI1 , BR2 , BI2 are jointly Gaussian RVs; (jj) all the entries of the complementary covariance matrix,\nJbb = E{bbT } \u2212 E{b}E{bT }, are equal to zero;\n(jjj) the covariance matrix, Kbb = E{bbH} \u2212 E{b}E{bH}, where H indicates the conjugate transpose, is diagonal.\nObserving the definitions of BR and BI in (12) and (13), it is clear that every linear combination of BR1 , BI1 , BR2 , BI2 results in the sum of N independent RVs. According to the central limit theorem, the PDF of the sum is approximately Gaussian. Therefore, for a number N sufficiently high, the condition (j) is satisfied. Jbb is a 2 \u00d7 2 symmetric matrix (called also pseudocovariance matrix) whose diagonal entries are\nJbb [1, 1] = \u03c3 2 R1 \u2212 \u03c32I1 + j2\u03b7R1,I1 (65) Jbb [2, 2] = \u03c3 2 R2\n\u2212 \u03c32I2 + j2\u03b7R2,I2 (66) where \u03c32Xx indicates the variance of BXx and \u03b7Xx,Yy indicates the covariance between BXx and BYy . According to previous sections, BR1 andBI1 are almost independent variables with almost the same variance; the same holds for BR2 andBI2 . Therefore,Jbb[1, 1] andJbb[2, 2] can be considered negligible. To satisfy the condition (jj), there remains to study whether the complementary covariance between B1 and B2,\nJbb [1, 2] = Jbb [2, 1] = E {B1B2} \u2212 E {B1}E {B2} = \u03b7R1,R2 \u2212 \u03b7I1,I2 + j (\u03b7R2,I1 + \u03b7R1,I2) , (67)\nis equal to zero or has a negligible modulus. As Kbb is a 2\u00d72 Hermitian matrix, to satisfy the condition (jjj), it is sufficient to study whether the covariance between B1 and B2,\nKbb [1, 2] = Kbb[2, 1] \u2217 = E {B1B\u22172} \u2212 E {B1}E {B\u22172}\n= \u03b7R1,R2 + \u03b7I1,I2 + j (\u03b7R2,I1 \u2212 \u03b7R1,I2) , (68) is equal to zero or has a negligible modulus.\nTo assess the negligibility of the two covariances, Jbb[1, 2] and Kbb[1, 2], the related complex correlation coefficients [42]\n\u03c1J = Jbb [1, 2]\u221a \u03c32B1\u03c3 2 B2\n(69)\n\u03c1K = Kbb [1, 2]\u221a\n\u03c32B1\u03c3 2 B2\n, (70)\nwhich satisfy 0 \u2264 |\u03c1J| \u2264 1 and 0 \u2264 |\u03c1K| \u2264 1, will be adopted. Assuming a spherical symmetry for the position errors, the ABP variance does not depend on the direction and, therefore, the\ndenominators \u221a \u03c32B1\u03c3 2 B2 are simply equal to \u03c32B .

To solve the expectation in \u03bc\u2212u and \u03bc + u , position errors with zero-mean Gaussian PDF and variance \u03c32\u03b5 along the three axes can be assumed. In analogy with (52) and (54), one obtains\n\u03bc\u00b1u = exp ( \u2212k 2\u03c32\u03b5\u2016u\u03021 \u00b1 u\u03022\u20162 2 ) (82)\nwhere ||\u00b7||2 represents the square norm of a vector. Because the nominal performance of a linear array placed on the z-axis does not depend on the azimuth angle \u03b1, one can assume that \u03b11 = \u03b12. In this case, the terms \u03bc\u2212u and \u03bc + u depend only on the difference between the broadside angles, \u03b81 and \u03b82, related to the directions u\u03021 and u\u03022, as follows\n\u03bc\u00b1u = exp {\u2212k2\u03c32\u03b5 [1\u00b1 cos (\u03b82 \u2212 \u03b81)]} (83)"

Fig. 11 shows the profile of the absolute value of the correlation coefficient \u03c1K for the array combinations C-2,\nC-4, C-6 and C-8, in comparison with the related NBPs. In particular, for each array combination, the correlation coefficient is computed starting from the peak of the main lobe (i.e., \u03b81 = 90\u00b0) and from the peak of an arbitrarily chosen side lobe (i.e., \u03b81 = \u221225\u00b0, \u22126\u00b0, \u221230\u00b0 and 6\u00b0 for C-2, C-4, C-6 and C-8, respectively). The complementary correlation coefficient \u03c1J is not shown in Fig. 11 because in all the cases considered its absolute value is always very low, with a maximum equal to 0.05. Therefore, although not equal to zero, all the entries of the complementary covariance matrix are negligible and condition (jj) is almost satisfied.\nFinally, the uncorrelatedness and independence of BP lobes principally depend on the profile of the correlation coefficient \u03c1K. From Fig. 11 one can observe that the correlation coefficient: remains high, close to one, within the lobe under examina-\ntion; gradually decreases moving away from the lobe under examination, assuming an intermediate value (generally between 0.8 and 0.2) within the lobes adjacent to the one under examination; oscillates around low values (with a maximum of 0.26) within the lobes not adjacent to the one under examination. Although there is no perfect uncorrelatedness between ABP points belonging to different NBP lobes, it can be concluded that their correlation is generally low, especially if the two lobes are far apart. Overall, although in previous studies focused on conventional arrays [25], [26] perfect independence between lobes was assumed, for superdirective arrays (with Gaussian, spherically symmetric position errors) it is possible to assume that non-adjacent lobes are almost independent, whereas adjacent lobes retain a significant correlation. The array combinations considered above are those for which the PDF set is S2. If the PDF set S1 is used in place of S2, the profiles of the correlation coefficients change only marginally and the conclusions hold their validity."

            "text": "In this section an empirical approach is adopted to investigate the size of the interval over which the ABP exceeds the quantile function Bq,\u03b3(u\u0302), in relation with the probability (1 \u2013 \u03b3) that a given point of such a quantile function is exceeded. The study is limited to the case of linear arrays with Gaussian, spherically symmetric position errors.\nThe following notations and conventions are introduced. For \u03b8 ranging from\u221290\u00b0 to 90\u00b0, the NBP of a given array has a number T of lobes (T \u2212 1 side lobes and one main lobe), indicated as Ln, n = 1, . . . , T . The support of the lobe Ln is a finite interval of the \u03b8-axis, (\u03b8s, \u03b8e), indicated as \u2110n, whose size (\u03b8e \u2013 \u03b8s) is indicated with \ud835\udcb5n. An event in which the modulus of the ABP, |B(\u03b8)|, exceeds the quantile function Bq,\u03b3(\u03b8) over one\nor more sub-intervals of the region \u2110n is defined overrun of the lobe Ln. If at least one of these sub-intervals has a size greater than a fraction \u039e \u2208 [0, 1], of the size \ud835\udcb5n, then the event OVn\u03b3,\u039e occurs. More precisely, for a given lobe n, a given probability \u03b3, and a given fraction \u039e, the event OVn\u03b3,\u039e occurs if the following condition is satisfied, one or more times:\n|B (\u03b8)| > Bq,\u03b3 (\u03b8) for all \u03b8 \u2208 (\u03b8l, \u03b8u) , where \u23a7\u23a8 \u23a9\n\u03b8l \u2265 \u03b8s \u03b8u \u2264 \u03b8e \u03b8u\u2212\u03b8l \ud835\udcb5n\n> \u039e (84)\nFig. 12 shows an overrun example for the C-5 array, in which the third lobe of the NBP (i.e.,L3) has a support \u21103: (\u03b8s, \u03b8e), with \u03b8s=\u221210\u00b0, \u03b8e=32\u00b0, and the size\ud835\udcb53 equal to 42\u00b0. The plot shows an ABP that exceeds the quantile function Bq,0.90(\u03b8) for all \u03b8 (1.5\u00b0, 24.5\u00b0), producing an overrun whose size is 23\u00b0. Because 23\u00b0/42\u00b0 is 0.55, the event OV30.90,\u039e occurs for all \u039e \u2208 [0, 0.55).\nHere the aim is to assess the probability that the event OVn\u03b3,\u039e does not occur, i.e., the probability that none of the overruns (if any) of the lobe Ln has a size larger than \u039e\ud835\udcb5n. This probability, as a function of\u039e, is indicated byCn\u03b3 (\u039e) and is defined as follows\nCn\u03b3 (\u039e) = 1\u2212 Pr (OVn\u03b3,\u039e ) (85)\nwhere Pr(a) is the probability of the event a. For each combination in Table I, 104 independent realizations of the ABP were computed and the Pr(OVn\u03b3,\u039e ) was estimated through the relative frequency of the event. The relative frequency was computed as a function of \u039e and for every lobe of the superdirective NBP, including the main-lobe. The number of lobes was: T = 3 for C-1 and C-2; T = 7 for C-3 and C-4; T = 4 for C-5 and C-6; T = 12 for C-7 and C-8. This study was repeated for two values of the probability \u03b3, i.e., the variable used to identify the quantile function Bq,\u03b3(u\u0302): \u03b3 = 0.90 and \u03b3 = 0.99. The corresponding functionsCn\u03b3 (\u039e), forn = 1, . . . , T, are shown in Fig. 13. Each panel contains a number of curves equal to the number of lobes, T , present in the NBP. One can observe that most of these curves cross the probability level Cn\u03b3 = \u03b3 for \u039e \u2208 [0.4, 0.5]. Consequently, for 0.9 \u2264 \u03b3 \u2264 1, the following empirical relation can be deduced\nCn\u03b3 (0.45) \u2248 \u03b3 (86) for whatever n, n = 1, . . . , T . This means that, when only the support of the n-th lobe of the NBP is considered, the probability that the ABP does not show any overrun of the quantile function Bq,\u03b3(\u03b8) with a size larger than 0.45 \ud835\udcb5n is approximately equal to \u03b3.\nAlthough adjacent lobes retain significant correlation, it is possible to assume the BP lobes to be independent (as is mostly the case for non-adjacent lobes), evaluating a posteriori the errors introduced by this choice. Assuming the independence, the property in (86) can be used to approximate the probability\n\u03c1J =\n( \u039b 2 \u03bc2\u03d5\u03bc + u \u2212 \u039b2\u03bc2\u0398 )\u2211N l=1 (\u039b n l )\n2exp {j [2 (\u03d5nl + \u03d5wl ) + kpnl \u00b7 (u\u03021 + u\u03022 \u2212 2u\u03020)]}( \u039b 2 \u2212 \u039b2\u03bc2\u0398 )\u2211N l=1 (\u039b n l ) 2 (80)\nthat the entire ABP does not show any overrun exceeding a given size. Since the average lobe size is equal to \u03c0/T [rad], the probability C\u0303\u03b3(\u2110) that the modulus of the ABP, |B(\u03b8)|, does not show any overrun of the quantile function Bq,\u03b3(\u03b8) with a size larger than \u2110, \u2110 = 0.45 \u03c0/T [rad], can be approximated as follows:\nC\u0303\u03b3 (\u2110) \u2248 \u03b3T . (87) This equation needs to be carefully assessed, especially to appraise the magnitude of the errors introduced by the independence assumption."

Similarly, the independence between different BP lobes requires verifying the profile of two correlation coefficients as a function of the arrival direction. In the latter case, it was necessary to assume spherical symmetry for the statistics of the position errors to achieve a compact expression.\nLinear superdirective arrays with end-fire steering and a number of elements high enough to apply the central limit theorem show a remarkable adherence to the Rician PDF and a partial independence between the lobes, especially non-adjacent ones. These two achievements form the basis for identifying the quantile BP functions (i.e., functions with a known probability of being exceeded by the ABP, at any direction) and for calculating the probability that no overrun occurs with a support larger than a given value. For the linear end-fire arrays examined, an empirical equation for calculating this probability was proposed and experimentally assessed.\nThe new knowledge and mathematical tools introduced in this study allow, on the one hand, to repeat the investigation on ABP Ricianity, lobes\u2019 independence and probability of extended overruns for other array geometries and characteristics, on the other hand, to hypothesize a new class of methods for the design of superdirective arrays, aimed at the optimization of the quantile BP functions. The meaning of the latter is indeed more consistent with the goal of robust design than that of the EBPP, used in many literature methods."

            "text": "To investigate spherical symmetry, it is convenient to rewrite the vectors u\u0302 and \u03b5l in a new coordinate system, centered on pnl , with the z-axis parallel to u\u0302. In the new coordinate system\nu\u0302 = [0, 0, 1] ; \u03b5l = rl [sin \u03c7\u0303l cos \u03b1\u0303l, sin \u03c7\u0303l sin \u03b1\u0303l, cos \u03c7\u0303l] (103) where rl is modulus of the displacement vector \u03b5l, \u03b1\u0303l and \u03c7\u0303l are the azimuth and polar angles, respectively, that identify the direction of \u03b5l in the new coordinate system. According to Assumptions 1 and 2, rl, \u03b1\u0303l and \u03c7\u0303l are independent RVs and their PDFs do not depend on l. The spherical symmetry is obtained by setting a uniform density for \u03b1\u0303 and \u03c7\u0303. In spherical coordinates, this means that\n\u03b2\u03b1\u0303,\u03c7\u0303 (\u03b1\u0303, \u03c7\u0303) = \u03b2\u03b1\u0303 (\u03b1\u0303)\u03b2\u03c7\u0303 (\u03c7\u0303) = sin \u03c7\u0303\n4\u03c0 , \u03b1\u0303 \u2208 [\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0] , \u03c7\u0303 \u2208 [0, \u03c0]\n(104) In these conditions, the expectation in (59) results to be\nE {cos (k\u03b5l \u00b7 u\u0302)}\n= 1\n4\u03c0 \u222b \u221e 0 \u222b \u03c0 \u2212\u03c0 \u222b \u03c0 0 cos (kr cos \u03c7\u0303) sin\u03c7\u0303\u03b2r (r)d\u03c7\u0303d\u03b1\u0303dr\n= \u222b \u221e 0 sinc ( kr \u03c0 ) \u03b2r (r) dr (105)\nwhere \u03b2r(r) is the PDF of the modulus of the error vector.\nREFERENCES\n[1] H.
