    "abstractText": "Although antiangiogenic therapy has been used in gastric cancer, disease progression due to drug resistance remains common. Neutrophils play an important role in the occurrence and progression of cancer via neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). However, few studies have investigated angiogenic regulation in gastric cancer. We aimed to determine the role of NETs in promoting angiogenesis in gastric cancer. Multiple immunohistochemical staining was used to analyze the spatial distribution of NETs and microvessels in patient tissue samples. A mouse subcutaneous tumor model was established to determine the effect of NETs on tumor growth, and changes in microvessel density were observed via immunohistochemical staining. We screened differentially expressed proteins in HUVECs stimulated by NETs via proteomics. Cell Counting Kit-8, EdU labeling, and tubule formation assays were used to verify the effect of NETs on HUVEC proliferation, migration, and tubule formation. Blocking NETs, which was related to decreased microvessel density, significantly inhibited tumor growth in the murine subcutaneous tumor model. Compared with those of the control group, tumor volume and mass among mice in the inhibition group decreased by 61.3% and 77.9%, respectively. The NET-DNA receptor CCDC25 was expressed in HUVECs, providing a platform for NETs to promote HUVEC proliferation, migration, and tubulation. In an in vitro rat aortic explant model, NETs induced HUVEC proliferation, survival, and chemotaxis, which were not significantly different from those observed in the VEGF stimulation group. Our results confirm that NETs promote angiogenesis in gastric cancer, providing a theoretical basis for identifying new anti-vascular therapeutic targets.",

            "text": "Angiogenesis is important for tumor progression and plays a key role in tumor growth and metastasis [1, 2]. In the 1970s, Professor Folkman proposed that tumor growth and metastasis depended on angiogenesis, and inhibition of angiogenesis could be an effective strategy for tumor treatment [3, 4]. In recent years, the identification of targeted angiogenic factors has become a popular area of research in tumor treatment and prevention [5, 6]. Presently, antiangiogenic drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration are classified into single- and multitarget inhibitors [7]. Vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) are important target molecules against tumor angiogenesis, and their inhibition has demonstrated favorable therapeutic effects in many cancers.\nGastric cancer is a common malignancy of the digestive system characterized by strong heterogeneity, treatment refractoriness, and a poor prognosis [8, 9]. Anti-VEGF therapy has been used in gastric cancer and has shown favorable clinical results [10\u201312]; however, similar to the results of other treatments, some patients eventually develop resistance to VEGF therapy [13]. Therefore, other targets must be explored to inhibit angiogenesis and provide alternative effective treatments.\nStudies have suggested that tumor angiogenesis results from the interaction of various cells and factors, including tumor cells and endothelial cells [14, 15]. Immune cells, such as macrophages, are recruited and promote angiogenesis in the tumor microenvironment in some patients who are resistant to VEGF inhibitors [16]. In a transplanted tumor model of Lewis lung cancer,\nTie2 activation was found to induce normalization of the tumor vasculature, enhance blood perfusion and chemotherapeutic drug release, significantly reduce lactic acidosis, and reduce tumor growth and metastasis. Simultaneously activating Tie2 and inhibiting Ang2 is an effective treatment strategy for enhancing chemotherapeutic drug entry into tumors [17].\nAlthough several immune cell types infiltrate the tumor microenvironment, their distribution and function differ depending on the tumor type [18, 19]. Previously, neutrophils were considered the first line of defense against pathogens and inflammatory cells and were necessary for maintaining normal immune function [20]. However, recent studies have contradicted the traditional perception regarding neutrophils by demonstrating their immunosuppressive function in tumors. Many studies have shown that neutrophils can fight malignancies, although detailed mechanistic insights are lacking. For example, in colon cancer, high neutrophil counts were related to a good prognosis [21], and in breast cancer models, depletion of neutrophils promoted disease progression [22]. Macrophages can activate neutrophils through interferons to secrete chemokines and cytokines that activate the immune system [23]. Neutrophils can also directly attack cancer cells by producing ROS and ATP [24]. Gentles et\u00a0al. analyzed the density of immune cell groups and survival times of patients with 39 cancer types, including 3,000 solid tumors, and found that the group with high-density neutrophil infiltration had the most unfavorable prognosis [25]. Increased neutrophil levels play an important role in the prognosis of cancer patients\nbecause neutrophils can inhibit the antitumor immune response.\nNeutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are special structures based on neutrophils [26]. Recent studies have shown that NETs play an important role in promoting tumor progression [27, 28]. In our previous study, extensive neutrophil infiltration and NET deposition in gastric cancer were observed, both of which were associated with poor prognoses. Moreover, in\u00a0 vitro, we found that NETs promoted invasion, metastasis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) in gastric cancer cells and stimulated endothelial cells to release tissue factors that activate the coagulation pathway without significantly affecting cell proliferation [29\u201331]. Thus, antagonizing NETs could significantly inhibit tumor growth related to a decrease in microvessel density in subcutaneous tumor models of animals. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effects of NETs on endothelial cell function and angiogenesis in gastric cancer patients using proteomics to explore how neutrophils promote cancer progression and to provide a basis for the development of new therapies against tumor angiogenesis."

To study NET deposition in gastric cancer tissues, we performed immunohistochemical analyses of clinical specimens from the patients with stage I (n = 20), II (n = 20), and III (n = 20) gastric cancer and the corresponding adjacent tissues. Neutrophil infiltration and NET deposition occurred, and the samples were positive for MPO, cit-H3, and CD66b (Fig.\u00a01c). Moreover, hematoxylin\u2013eosin staining showed many microvessels in the tumor tissue (Fig.\u00a01c). The expression area coverage of CD66b, cit-H3, and MPO identified by immunohistochemical staining in different stages showed significant differences (Fig.\u00a01d). Multiplex immunohistochemistry showed highly consistent spatial localization of the NET markers cit-H3, MPO, and CD31 (Fig.\u00a0 1e). Moreover, morphological changes in neutrophils during different stages of NET release were observed via electron microscopy (Fig.\u00a01f ).\nNeutrophils from\u00a0gastric cancer patients release NETs more easily than\u00a0those from\u00a0healthy individuals To compare the ability of neutrophils to release NETs between healthy volunteers and gastric cancer patients, we isolated and extracted neutrophils from whole blood samples of patients with stage III gastric cancer and healthy volunteers. GES-1, the metastatic gastric cancer cell line MKN-45, the gastric cancer in\u00a0situ cell line AGS, and HGC27-conditioned media were used as stimulants to assess NET release via immunofluorescence. The analysis showed that neutrophils from gastric cancer patients released NETs more easily under the same conditions and that the effect of stimulation of the tumor cell supernatant was stronger than that of GES-1 (Fig.\u00a02a\u2013d).\nFig. 3 DNase-1 inhibited tumor growth in relation to a decrease in microvessel density. a Subcutaneous tumor samples from nude mice treated with DNase-1 and the control group (n = 5). b Growth curve of subcutaneous tumor in nude mice; all values are presented as means \u00b1 SDs. ****p < 0.0001. c Subcutaneous tumor sample weights; all values are presented as means \u00b1 SDs. ***p < 0.001. d Microvessel densities in tumor tissues of the control and DNase-1 treatment groups as assessed by immunohistochemical staining.

The results of the scratch test showed that NETs could significantly promote migration. The transwell assay showed that NETs could significantly promote the invasion of gastric cancer cells (Fig.\u00a02e\u2013h). However, CCK-8 and plate cloning experiments showed that NETs had no obvious effects on the proliferation of gastric cancer cells (Fig. S1a,b).\nNET inhibition can suppress tumor growth via decreased microvessel density in animal models As the cell experiments showed that NETs had no obvious effect on the proliferation of gastric cancer cell lines, we examined whether NETs played a role in tumor angiogenesis using a murine tumor model. Intraperitoneal injection of DNase I reduced the growth volume and weight of subcutaneous gastric cancer tumors compared with those of the control group (Fig.\u00a03a, c). The growth curve showed that DNase I treatment significantly inhibited the growth rate of tumors (Fig.\u00a0 3b). Having found that NETs had no significant effect on the proliferation of gastric cancer cells in\u00a0 vitro, we explored whether NETs could promote tumor growth by increasing angiogenesis. We found a lower positivity rate of CD31 in the tumor tissues injected with DNase I, with less NET infiltration into the tumor tissue. Positive staining of cit-H3 and MPO was used as a marker (Fig.\u00a03d, h, i) and showed significant differences (Fig.\u00a03e\u2013g).\nProteomic analysis of\u00a0differential protein expression induced by\u00a0NET stimulation in\u00a0endothelial cells To explore the specific effect of NETs on HUVECs, we subjected unstimulated HUVECs and HUVECs stimulated with NETs to tandem mass tag-tandem mass spectrometry (TMT-MS/MS) analysis and collected a total of 363,519 secondary mass spectra. Among them, there were 83,412 effective mass spectra, with a utilization rate of 22.9% (Fig.\u00a04a). Among the quantifiable proteins, 123 upregulated proteins and 73 downregulated proteins were observed in the NET-stimulated group but not in the unstimulated group (Fig.\u00a04b)."

            "text": "Using proteomics, we found that HUVECs expressed CCDC25 (Table S1). Based on the histological results, we performed basic experiments and obtained the following results. Western blotting identified CCDC25 expression in HUVECs, HUVEC-C, and HMVECs (Fig.\u00a0 4c). Immunofluorescence analysis of CCDC25 localization in endothelial cells showed that CCDC25 was a transmembrane protein whose transfer into the cytoplasm increased after NET stimulation (Fig.\u00a0 4d, e). Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining showed that cancer tissues expressed more CCDC25 receptors than paracarcinoma tissues (Fig.\u00a04f, g).\nWe further analyzed the biological function of CCDC25 in gastric cancer using bioinformatics. In the immune infiltration analysis, CCDC25 only showed statistical significance with neutrophil infiltration (Fig.\u00a0 5a, b), which was highly consistent with our experimental results. We further analyzed the differences in chemosensitivity and targeted drug sensitivity in gastric cancer patients with high and low CCDC25 expression. The results showed that patients with low CCDC25 expression experienced better effects from a variety of chemotherapeutic drugs and immunosuppressants (Fig.\u00a05c\u2013k).\nNETs promote endothelial cell proliferation, migration and\u00a0tubule formation Upon further evaluating the effects of NETs on HUVECs, we found that endothelial cell proliferation was not obvious when the concentration of NETs was 0.2\u00a0\u03bcg/mL but increased significantly at 0.4\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, and there was no significant difference between the results at concentrations of 0.8 and 0.4\u00a0\u03bcg/mL (Fig.\u00a06a). A concentration of 0.4\u00a0\u03bcg/mL in the EdU experiment resulted in significantly higher proliferation in the experimental group than in the control group, and this effect could be eliminated by DNase I treatment (Fig.\u00a0 6b, c). After endothelial cells were stimulated with NETs in a concentration-dependent manner, western blot analysis showed that the levels of connexin VE-cadherin and the compact protein ZO-1 decreased significantly at 0.4\u00a0 \u03bcg/mL NETs (Fig.\u00a0 6d\u2013g). Immunofluorescence showed that after endothelial cell stimulation with 0.4\u00a0\u03bcg/mL NETs, the intercellular space increased, and\n(See figure on next page.)

However, DNase I treatment weakened this phenomenon (Fig.\u00a06h-j). To determine the effects of NETs on endothelial cell migration, we carried out a scratch test. In contrast to the results in the control group, NETs significantly stimulated HUVEC migration in the experimental group (Fig.\u00a0 6k, l). The tubule formation experiment showed a stronger tubule formation ability at 0.4\u00a0\u03bcg/mL NETs (Fig.\u00a07c, d). These results suggest that NETs can directly stimulate endothelial cell proliferation, survival, and migration.\nProteomic analysis showed that NETs had no significant effect on the traditional angiogenic factor VEGF but promoted ANGPT2 production (Figs. S2a, b). Using immunofluorescence, we found that NETs stimulated ANGPT2 release from endothelial cells, and DNase I treatment weakened this phenomenon (Fig.\u00a0 7a, b). We further analyzed the function of ANGPT2 through bioinformatics and found that high ANGPT2 expression was significantly associated with a poor prognosis, and its expression level was consistent with neutrophil infiltration (Fig. S2c, S2d). Patients with high ANGPT2 expression had lower tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion scores and were more likely to benefit from immunotherapy, which provides a reference to guide the use of immunosuppressants (Fig. S2e). Furthermore, we found high levels of ANGPT2 expression in the tumor tissues of gastric cancer patients and even greater levels in adjacent tissues using immunohistochemical staining; the results were statistically significant (Fig. S2f, S2g).\nNETs promote angiogenesis of\u00a0arterial rings in\u00a0SD female rats To explore the process of angiogenesis in\u00a0 vivo, we embedded the isolated arterial rings of SD female rats into Matrigel as an in\u00a0 vitro model to study microvessels. We found that 0.4 and 0.8\u00a0 \u03bcg/mL NETs significantly promoted vascular development, but the effect was not significantly different from that in the VEGF group; furthermore, the effect of 0.2\u00a0 \u03bcg/mL NETs was not significant (Fig.\u00a07e, f ).\nNETs induce activation of\u00a0the\u00a0AKT/mTOR signaling pathway To investigate the downstream signaling pathway induced by NETs in endothelial cells, we performed western blot analysis and found that coculture with NETs for 24\u00a0h increased the phosphorylation of AKT and mTOR in HUVECs. The relative increase in quantitative expression was statistically significant (Fig.\u00a07g, h)."

            "text": "In this study, the deposition of large amounts of NETs in the tissues of gastric cancer patients was related to a worse clinical stage and abundant blood supply. We screened differentially expressed proteins induced by the effects of NETs on HUVECs in gastric cancer patients using proteomics technology and explored whether NETs promote angiogenesis in gastric cancer. TMTMS/MS identified 6,182 differentially expressed proteins after HUVEC stimulation with NETs. Functional enrichment analysis of the identified differentially expressed proteins showed that NETs played a role in the regulation of cell metabolism, apoptosis, immune and defense responses, and other pathways in HUVECs. TMT-MS/ MS results showed that endothelial cells expressed the NET-DNA receptor CCDC25, which could directly promote endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tubule formation. The experimental model of arterial rings in\u00a0 vitro showed significant promotion of neovascularization. In\u00a0 vivo studies confirmed that NETs promoted tumor growth by increasing microvessel density, whereas DNase I inhibited NET-induced tumor angiogenesis and thus suppressed tumor progression. There is evidence that NETs play a role in angiogenesis: in pulmonary hypertensive vascular disease, NETs promote neovascularization and improve ischemia and hypoxia [34]. However, there is little evidence about the role of NETs in tumor angiogenesis.\nNETs consist of chromatin from DNA fragments encapsulating granule proteins, which are released by neutrophils to capture microorganisms [35, 36]. Although the mechanism underlying the effects of NETs\n(See figure on next page.)

NET, neutrophil extracellular trap; DNase-1, deoxyribonuclease I; SD, standard deviation\non cancer cells has not been fully elucidated, recent findings suggest that NETs promote cancer progression. Park et\u00a0 al. showed that lung metastasis may occur after 4T1 metastatic breast cancer cells are injected into the tail veins of LysM-EGFP mice, and there is extensive NET formation in lung metastatic foci. Immunofluorescence assays of lung tissue sections showed that the number of neutrophils producing NETosis significantly increased 4\u00a0 days after tumor cell injection, and DNase I reduced the occurrence of lung tumor metastasis in mice [37]. For colon cancer patients who underwent hepatectomy, the 5-year survival rate of patients with elevated levels of peripheral blood NETs was significantly lower than that of patients with normal NET levels [38]. Our previous studies also confirmed that NETs can promote EMT in gastric cancer cells, and NET inhibition can reduce the occurrence of liver metastasis in animal models. An inferior vena cava embolism model in tumor-bearing mice showed a large amount of NET deposits in the thrombus. In this study, we found that greater NET deposition and the presence of abundant microvessels translated to a worse clinical stage. Clinically, neutrophils from gastric cancer patients were more likely to be activated and release NETs under the same conditions than those from healthy volunteers. Therefore, we hypothesize that NETs play an important role in the occurrence and development of gastric cancer.\nNie et\u00a0al. confirmed that NETs promote the proliferation and migration of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cells via TLR9 signaling and mediate the progression of lymphoma [39]. Although the results of the current study are consistent with those of other studies, the difference in this study lies in our finding that NETs had no significant effect on the proliferation of gastric cancer cells. Song et\u00a0 al. found that NET-DNA activates the intracellular ILK-\u03b2-parvin signaling pathway and enhances the motor ability of cells by binding to the transmembrane protein receptor CCDC25 on the surface of cancer cells. Knockout or blockade of the CCDC25 protein can significantly inhibit NET-DNA-mediated metastasis of cancer cells, which confirms that CCDC25 is the receptor\nof NET-DNA [40]. In this study, we screened the differentially expressed proteins resulting from HUVEC stimulation by NETs using the TMT-MS/MS technique and found that HUVECs also expressed CCDC25. Through immunofluorescence localization, we found that CCDC25, a transmembrane protein expressed in HUVECs, was transferred to the cytoplasm after NET stimulation, activated the AKT/mTOR axis to mediate signal transduction, and promoted HUVEC proliferation, migration, and tubule formation, thereby initiating neovascularization, improving the ischemic condition of the tumor microenvironment, and promoting tumor growth. Through further bioinformatics analysis, we found that CCDC25 was significantly associated with neutrophils in immune cell infiltration, which further verified the reliability of our results. Moreover, drug sensitivity analysis showed that gastric cancer patients with low CCDC25 expression had a better response to drugs, which is relevant information for guiding clinicians in selecting drug treatments.\nEndothelial cells are some of the most silent cells in the human body, with a proliferation rate close to zero in a steady state; however, with adequate stimulation, they can re-enter the cell cycle [41]. Tight junctions play an important role in maintaining vascular integrity and controlling the permeability of the endothelial monolayer [42]. Hence, downregulated expression or loss of tight junctions can affect cell migration, proliferation, polarity, and differentiation, which may promote cancer progression. Primary breast tumors reduce the levels of tight junction-related ZO-1 proteins in endothelial cells, which are associated with metastasis in breast cancer patients [43]. MicroRNAs may also cause tight junction failure [44]. Few studies have investigated the effect of NETs on tight junctions in tumors. Wang et\u00a0al. showed that NETs can damage the integrity of endothelial cells and promote permeability, thus aggravating bleeding during the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia. After DNase I stabilized the cytoskeletal distribution of connexin and actin, the endothelial cell permeability and erythrocyte exudation rate were significantly reduced [45]. Our\nFig. 7 NETs activated the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway to promote angiogenesis. a The effect of NET-stimulated HUVECs on the injury factor vWF and pro-angiogenic factor ANGPT2 and the inhibitory effect of DNase-1 were observed via immunofluorescence.

In the current study, we found that NETs significantly stimulated endothelial cells; decreased the expression of CD31, ZO-1, and VE-cadherin; contracted the cytoskeleton; enlarged the intercellular space; and promoted the proliferation and migration of HUVECs, whereas DNase I significantly inhibited these phenomena. Recent studies have shown that neovascularization can promote the distant metastasis of tumor cells, which is significantly related to the high permeability of HUVECs [47]. However, the main purpose of this study was to explore the role of neovascularization in promoting gastric cancer proliferation; whether neovascularization induces the distant metastasis of gastric cancer remains to be confirmed.\nTumor angiogenesis is a complex process that is regulated by tumor angiogenic factors (positive regulation) and antitumor angiogenic factors (negative regulation), and the occurrence of angiogenesis mainly depends on a balance between the two [48]. Tumor cells can release angiogenic factors, including VEGF, fibroblast growth factor, angiopoietin, epidermal growth factor, plateletderived growth factor, and matrix metalloproteinases that promote tumor neovascularization, among which VEGF plays a decisive role in promoting endothelial cell growth and differentiation [49]. At present, targeted drugs that suppress tumor angiogenesis mainly inhibit VEGF and commonly include pazopanib and ivermus, which are used in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma [50]. Bevacizumab, which is used to treat non-small cell lung cancer, also inhibits VEGF [51]. In addition, panizumab, cetuximab, and trastuzumab are all targeted inhibitors of VEGF. Therapeutic effects have been demonstrated in the clinical application of VEGF inhibitors; however, the occurrence of drug resistance greatly reduces the effectiveness of these drugs [52]. Therefore, other targets that promote angiogenesis should be inhibited via drug combinations to better antagonize tumor angiogenesis. In this study, we found that the effect of NETs on VEGF induction in HUVECs was not significant. In\u00a0 vitro murine arterial ring neovascularization and lumen formation experiments showed that NETs significantly promoted neovascularization but had no synergistic effect with VEGF. The subcutaneous tumor model in nude mice revealed lower tumor volume, tumor growth rate, and microvessel density among mice treated with DNase I than in the control group. Therefore, we believe that targeting NETs may be an effective strategy for antagonizing tumor neovascularization and inhibiting tumor growth.\nThis study has some limitations. First, we utilized single-center samples, and more samples are needed\nto verify our findings in future studies and to obtain results that are more widely representative. Second, we investigated gastric cancer, and the role of NETs in other malignant tumors of the digestive tract needs to be further explored. In addition, the effect of CCDC25 expression on chemotherapeutic drugs in gastric cancer is based on the Shengxin database, which needs to be verified and analyzed via more complete basic trials and clinical data."
