            "text": "In order to capture the logic of t-norm-based fuzzy logics and their residual [1], Esteva et al. introduced the t-norm-based fuzzy logic MTL [2], and the resulting class of algebras called MTL-algebras. They have interesting algebraic properties and cover all the mathematical structures that appear in a t-norm-based fuzzy logic framework, such as, MV-algebras, BL-algebras, G\u00f6del algebras, IMTL-algebras and R0-algebras. Therefore, MTL-algebras are important algebraic structures in which the community of fuzzy logicians have become interested [1\u20135]. The notion of derivations is instrumental in studying properties and structure in fuzzy logical algebraic structures. In 1957, Posner [6] studied kinds of derivations in a prime ring and some of their basic algebraic properties. Afterward, Jun, Borzooei and Zhan et al. [7\u20139] produced some characterizations of p-semisimple BCI-algebras via derivations with respect to BCI-algebras with derivation. In 2008, Xin, \u00c7even et al. [10\u201312] characterized modular lattices and distributive lattices by isotone derivations with respect to lattices with derivations. Furthermore, Alshehri, Ghorbain, Yazarli, et al. [13\u201315] derived the derivations on MV-algebras and gave some conditions under which an additive derivation is isotone, in fact, for a linearly ordered MV-algebra. In 2013, Lee et al. [16,17] introduced and studied derivations and f -derivations on lattice implication algebras and discussed the relations between derivations and filters. In 2016, He et al. [18] investigated the kinds of derivations in residuated lattices, and characterized Heyting algebras with respect to the above derivations. In 2017, Hua [19] studied derivations in R0-algebras, which are equivalent to NM-algebras, and discussed the relation between filters and the fixed point set of these derivations. The paper is motivated by the following considerations:\n(1) It is well-known that derivations have been studied on MV-algebras, BL-algebras IMTL-algebras and residuated lattices and so on. Although they are essentially different logical algebras they are all particular types of MTL-algebras. Thus, it is\nAxioms 2022, 11, 340. https://doi.org/10.3390/axioms11070340 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/axioms\nmeaningful for us to establish the derivation theory of MTL-algebras for studying the common properties of derivations in t-norm-based fuzzy logical algebras.\n(2) The previous research regarding derivations on logical algebras is multiplicative derivation, which is a map that satisfies\nd(x y) = (d(x) y)d (x d(y)).\nThere are few studies, however, regarding derivations defined by\u2192 and any other operations on residuated structures so far. Therefore, it is interesting to study these derivations on logical algebras.\n(3) It has always been known that Galois connections play a central role in studying logical algebras, and the relation between derivations and Galois connections is an important research topic to study. However, there are few research works regarding the relation between derivations and Galois connections on logical algebras so far. Thus, it is necessary for us to study the relation between derivations and Galois connections on logical algebras. Given these considerations, we propose a new type of derivation on MTL-algebras. Indeed,\n(1) The notion of implicative derivations, which are defined by the operations \u21aa\u2192 and d, is introduced on MTL-algebras, and some characterizations of them are given. (see Definition 3, Theorem 1). (2) Every implicative derivation is principle on IMTL-algebras (see Theorem 2, Remark 2). (3) Every Boolean algebra represents the sets of all implicative derivations on Boolean algebras (see Theorem 6). (4) There is an isotone Galois connection between the sets of multipliers and implicative derivations on IMTL-algebras (see Theorem 7). (5) There is a bijection between the sets of multiplier and implicative derivations on\nIMTL-algebras (see Theorem 8).\nIn Section 2, we review some basic nations and definitions of MTL-algebras. In Section 3, we introduce implicative derivations on MTL-algebras and provide some of their characterizations. In Section 4, we give some representations of MTL-algebras by implicative derivations. In Section 5, we discuss the relationships between implicative derivations with other operators on MTL-algebras."

(1)\u2013(3) are easily verified, we only show (4)\u2013(6). (4) It follows from (2) and Proposition 1(1). (5) From (4), we have\ng(u \u21aa\u2192 v) = (g(u) \u21aa\u2192 v) \u222a (u \u21aa\u2192 g(v)) = u \u21aa\u2192 g(v),\nfor any u, v \u2208 M. (6) It can be observed directly from (2) and Proposition 1(1).\nTheorem 1. Let g :M\u2192M be a map on an MTL-algebraM. Then the following are equivalent: (1) g \u2208 D(M), (2) g(u \u21aa\u2192 v) = u \u21aa\u2192 g(v) for any u, v \u2208 M.\nProof. (1)\u21d2 (2) Obviously from Proposition 2(5). (2)\u21d2 (1) From (2), we have\ng(1) = g(0 \u21aa\u2192 u) = 0 \u21aa\u2192 g(u) = 1,\nand hence 1 = g(u \u21aa\u2192 u) = u \u21aa\u2192 g(u),\nwhich implies u \u2264 g(u). Then by Proposition 1(1),\ng(u \u21aa\u2192 v) = u \u21aa\u2192 g(v) = (g(u) \u21aa\u2192 v)d (u \u21aa\u2192 g(v)),\nfor any u, v \u2208 M.\nRemark 1. The map gp :M\u2192M, as defined by\ngp(u) = p \u21aa\u2192 u\nfor any u \u2208 M, gp \u2208 G(M), which is said to be the principle implicative derivation. Indeed,\ngp(u \u21aa\u2192 v) = p \u21aa\u2192 (u \u21aa\u2192 v) = u \u21aa\u2192 (p \u21aa\u2192 v) = u \u21aa\u2192 gp(v),\nfor any u, v \u2208 M.\nBy Remark 1, whether any implicative derivation g can be represented as the form of gp.\nIndeed, this assertion is not true for MTL-algebra.\nExample 6. LetM = {0, u, v, 1} be a chain. Defining operations and \u21aa\u2192 are\n\u2297 0 u v 1 0 0 0 0 0 u 0 u u u v 0 u v v 1 0 u v 1\n\u21d2 0 u v 1 0 1 1 1 1 u 0 1 1 1 v 0 u 1 1 1 0 u v 1\nThen (M, min, max, , \u21aa\u2192, 0, 1) is an MTL-algebra. Defining g :M\u2192M as follows:\ng(x) =  u, x = 0 v, x = v 1, x = u, 1 ,\nand g \u2208 G(M). But\ng0(0) = 1 6= u, gu(0) = gv(0) = g1(0) = 0 6= u.\nSo g is not representative of gp, for any p \u2208 M.\nHowever, some positive answers are given under certain conditions.\nTheorem 2. Let g be an implicative derivation on an IMTL-algebra M. Then the following are equivalent:,\n(1) g \u2208 D(M), (2) g(u) = \u00acg(0) \u21aa\u2192 u.\nProof. (1) For any u \u2208 M, by Theorem 1, we have\ng(u) = g(\u00ac\u00acu) = g(\u00acu \u21aa\u2192 0) = \u00acu \u21aa\u2192 g(0) = u g(0)\n= g(0) u\n= \u00acg(0) \u21aa\u2192 u,\nfor any u \u2208 M. (2) Taking p = \u00acg(0) in Remark 1.\nRemark 2. (1) Theorem 2 shows that g is determined by the element \u00acg(0) on IMTL-algebras. If we take p = \u00acg(0), then every implicative derivation on IMTL-algebras is principle.\n(2) Every implicative derivation on IMTL-algebra is isotone. If u \u2264 v, then\ng(u) = \u00acg(0) \u21aa\u2192 u \u2264 \u00acg(0) \u21aa\u2192 v = g(v)."

(2) For any g \u2208 G(M), there exists a g(0) \u2208 M such that g = \u03c7((g(0))), which implies that \u03c7 is a surjection function. Indeed, by Theorem 1(2), we have g(u) = \u00acu \u21aa\u2192 g(0) = u g(0) = ud g(0) = \u03c7((g(0)))(u), for any u \u2208 M.\n(3) For any x, y \u2208 M, we have\n\u03c7(x e y)(u) = (x e y)d u\n= (x d u)e (y \u222a u) = (\u03c7(x) \u2229 \u03c7(y))(u),\n\u03c7(x d y)(u) = (x d y)e u\n= (x e u)d (ye u)\n= (\u03c7(x) \u222a \u03c7(y))(u), \u03c7(\u00acx)(u) = \u00acx d u\n= x \u21aa\u2192 u = (x \u21aa\u2192 u)e (u \u21aa\u2192 u) = (x d u) \u21aa\u2192 u = (\u03c7(x)(u))?.\nwhich implies that \u03c7 is a homomorphism.
