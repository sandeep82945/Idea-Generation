    "abstractText": "Benzoxazine resins are new thermosetting resins with excellent thermal stability, mechanical properties, and a flexible molecular design, demonstrating promise for applications in marine antifouling coatings. However, designing a multifunctional green benzoxazine resin-derived antifouling coating that combines resistance to biological protein adhesion, a high antibacterial rate, and low algal adhesion is still challenging. In this study, a high-performance coating with a low environmental impact was synthesized using urushiol-based benzoxazine containing tertiary amines as the precursor, and a sulfobetaine moiety into the benzoxazine group was introduced. This sulfobetaine-functionalized urushiol-based polybenzoxazine coating (poly(U\u2212ea/sb)) was capable of clearly killing marine biofouling bacteria adhered to the coating surface and significantly resisting protein attachment. poly(U\u2212ea/sb) exhibited an antibacterial rate of 99.99% against common Gram negative bacteria (e.g., Escherichia coli and Vibrio alginolyticus) and Gram positive bacteria (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus sp.), with >99% its algal inhibition activity, and it effectively prevented microbial adherence. Here, a dual-function crosslinkable zwitterionic polymer, which used an \u201coffensive-defensive\u201d tactic to improve the antifouling characteristics of the coating was presented. This simple, economic, and feasible strategy provides new ideas for the development of green marine antifouling coating materials with excellent performance.",

            "text": "Marine biofouling refers to the adherence of marine organisms on the surfaces of marine equipment, leading to economic damage in terms of human marine activities [1,2]. Marine biofouling is a global issue with permanent detrimental consequences on machinery [3,4]. Currently, petroleum-based resin self-polishing antifouling coatings comprising cuprous oxide (Cu2O) and a powerful biocide (such as zinc thiopyridine, copper/zinc pyridine thione, etc.) are widely used at home and abroad [5,6]. Although these self-polishing antifouling coatings prevent marine organisms from fouling, the coatings exert serious toxic effects on non-target marine organisms and the environment [7,8]. Therefore, to solve the ecotoxicological problems caused by the use of toxic antifouling coatings, designing and building green, long-lasting, excellent performance, and environmentally friendly new antifouling coatings, such as hydrophilic antifouling coatings, is imperative [9]. Most of the hydrophilic coatings exhibit eco-friendly and marine eco-friendly properties, which are highly sought after by researchers [10]. Owing to their good biocompatibility, hydrophilicity, non-toxicity, and excellent resistance to protein adhesion, zwitterionic polymers were initially used in medical devices [11], cotton fabrics [12], and filter membranes [13], and later for marine antifouling applications [14,15]. Zwitterionic polymers\nPolymers 2023, 15, 2383. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym15102383 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2023, 15, 2383 2 of 17\ncomprise the same number of anions and cations, in which the quaternary ammonium salt (R4N+) directly penetrates the cell membrane surface and binds to the negative charge of the phospholipid bilayer on the cell membrane via electrostatic interactions, resulting in cell membrane destruction and bacterial necrosis. On the other hand, zwitterionic polymers exhibit strong electrostatic-induced hydration; as a result, a tight water layer is easily formed on the material\u2019s surface, which in turn prevents the adhesion of fouling organisms effectively [16,17]. Chiang et al., prepared an antiprotein adhesion filtration membrane with a water flux recovery of 95.5% by grafting sulfobetaine methacrylate (SBMA) onto a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane surface [18]. Hibbs et al., prepared a series of polysulfone and polyacrylate-based amphoteric coatings on an epoxy resin primer aluminum substrate with 70% antibacterial and algal inhibition rates [19]. Liu prepared an innovative polymer brush on a resin matrix that can effectively inhibit the adhesion of red sponge larvae by one-step surface activation ATRP (SSI-ATRP) [20]. Zwitterionic polymers play a key role in hydrophilic antifouling coatings because of their good antifouling and environmental protection properties [21,22]. At the same time, under the \u201cdouble carbon,\u201d background, green, natural, easily extractable, and renewable natural products are selected as raw materials to prepare hydrophilic bio-based antifouling coatings. In addition, hydrophilic bio-based antifouling coatings are promising polymers because of their good hydrophilicity, cost-effectiveness, and commercial feasibility. However, most of the methods to synthesize zwitterionic materials coating materials involve direct polymerization and grafting with zwitterionic ions on the coating surface, which may involve complex chemical reactions and necessitate specific requirements on the coating surface; hence, commercialization is difficult. Therefore, designing and building zwitterionic bio-based coatings with excellent antifouling performance and in agreement with the modern \u201cgreen environmental protection\u201d marine antifouling concept is still challenging. Meanwhile, raw lacquer is a type of lacquer juice harvested from lacquer trees, which can be used as a natural and durable coating. Urushiol (U) is the main film-forming substance in raw lacquer, with a content of 60\u201370% [23]. Urushiol-based polymers exhibit incomparable uniqueness of petroleum-based resin coatings in terms of their mechanical properties, substrate adhesion, antibacterial and aging resistance. By introducing other functional groups and compounding degradable components, the structure and properties of urushiol-based polymers can be regulated effectively, and a new type of a bio-based marine antifouling coating with excellent performance can be prepared [24]. Previously, our group has successfully synthesized a low-surface-energy marine antifouling coating, referred to as urushiol-based benzoxazine copper polymer (UBCP) with antifouling performance, using urushiol, octylamine, and a copper compound as the phenolic source, amine source, and catalyst, respectively [25]. The as-obtained UBCP was cured into films at room temperature, which exhibited strong substrate adhesion, a smooth and dense surface, and the controllable release of an effective copper ion at minimized concentrations; hence, excellent antifouling performance was imparted to UBCP. As a new type of a thermosetting resin, benzoxazine exhibits high temperature resistance, chemical stability, and high durability. In the cross-linking reaction, benzoxazine easily forms a chemical bond with the coating substrate, such as the ring-opening addition of the oxazine ring, in which active methylene reacts strongly with electrophilic groups; as most of the substrates contain electrophilic groups, the adhesion of benzoxazine to the substrate is good [26\u201328]. Based on the above premise, the introduction of sulfobetaine into benzoxazine monomers is assumed to not only improve the poor hydrophilicity of benzoxazine through anions and cations effectively, but also the amphoteric ionization of polymers is easily conducted in comparison to direct polymerization. Reactive polymers with an adjustable chemical structure can be prepared with a high zwitterionic function and good antifouling performance. In this study, urushiol-based benzoxazine (U\u2212ea) is prepared by the Mannich condensation using urushiol, paraformaldehyde, and ethanolamine as the raw materials. Subsequently, sulfobetaine-functionalized benzoxazine (U\u2212ea/sb) is prepared by the reaction of a tertiary amine on the oxazine ring with sulfonate. The synthesis is simple, with no\nPolymers 2023, 15, 2383 3 of 17\nby-product. The effects of zwitterionic groups on the surface wettability, thermal stability and physical and mechanical properties of the coating can be analyzed by testing the contact angle, droplet adhesion, thermogravimetric analysis and mechanical properties of the coating. In addition, the antifouling performance of poly(U\u2212ea/sb) coatings is systematically investigated using typical Gram negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Vibrio alginolyticus (V. alginolyticus), Gram positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Bacillus. sp., and algal species such as Nitzschia closterium (N. closterium), Phaeodactylum tricornutum (P. tricornutum), and Dicrateria zhanjiangensis (D. zhanjiangensis). Bovine serum albumin (BSA) and \u03b3-globulin are used to systematically evaluate the antifouling performance of the poly(U\u2212ea/sb) coatings. In this paper, the development of antifouling coatings with significant hydrophilic and excellent antifouling properties is focused, and ideas are suggested for the preparation of new, efficient, eco-friendly, hydrophilic bio-based antifouling coatings with dual \u201coffensive-defensive\u201d antifouling mechanisms."

            "text": "First, the U\u2212ea monomer was synthesized by the Mannich condensation using natural urushiol and ethanolamine as the phenolic and amine sources, respectively (Scheme 2). The Supporting Information (Figure S1) shows the synthesis and characterization of U\u2212ea. Subsequently, the U\u2212ea/sb monomer was synthesized by the reaction of a tertiary amine on the U\u2212ea oxazine ring with 1,3\u2212propanesultone. The chemical structures of as-prepared U\u2212ea and U\u2212ea/sb monomers were characterized by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. Figure 1a shows the ATR-FTIR spectra of urushiol (U), U\u2212ea, and U\u2212ea/sb, as well as the analyses of the characteristic peaks of the major functional groups. In the ATR-FTIR spectra of U, U\u2212ea, and U\u2212ea/sb, the characteristic absorption peaks at 981 cm\u22121 and 945 cm\u22121 corresponded to the bending vibrations of the triene structure (-CH=CH-CH2-CH=CH-CH=CH-), as shown in Figure 1a; these vibrations were characteristic of the long side chains of urushiol, and the peaks at 2853 cm\u22121 and 2924 cm\u22121 corresponded to the stretching vibrations of the saturated carbon-carbon bond (Figure 1a). Compared with the ATR-FTIR spectrum of U, those of U\u2212ea and U\u2212ea/sb revealed a new characteristic absorption peak at 963 cm\u22121 (Figure 1a), corresponding to the C-H out-of-plane bending vibrations on the oxazine ring, confirming the successful synthesis of the urushiol-based benzoxazine monomers in the previous stage; this result is in agreement with the 1H NMR test results. Moreover, the characteristic absorption peak of the oxazine ring was observed in the ATR-FTIR spectrum of U\u2212ea/sb, indicating that the introduction of sulfobetaine did not destroy the oxazine ring structure and that functionalized benzoxazine was successfully synthesized. In addition, in the ATR-FTIR spectrum of U\u2212ea/sb, distinct single peaks were observed at 1164 cm\u22121 and 1034 cm\u22121, corresponding to the stretching vibrations of the\u2212SO3\u2212 group, indicative of the formation of sulfobetaine groups (Figure 1a). In the ATR-FTIR spectrum of urushiol, the broad absorption band at 3349 cm\u22121 corresponded to the vibrations of hydroxyl groups; the absorption band at 3009 cm\u22121 corresponded to the stretching vibrations of isolated =C\u2013H groups. In the ATR-FTIR spectra of U\u2212ea and U\u2212ea/sb, a stretching vibration peak of isolated =C\u2013H groups was also observed at 3009 cm\u22121. Thus, the syntheses of U\u2212ea and U\u2212ea/sb did not alter the isolated =C\u2013H groups of the long side chain. The ATR-FTIR spectra of the coated poly(U\u2212ea) and poly(U\u2212ea/sb) (Figure 1b) were compared with those of U\u2212ea and U\u2212ea/sb (Figure 1a): Clearly, significant differences were observed.

In addition, the stretching vibrations of the isolated =C\u2013 H groups at 3009 cm\u22121 disappeared. Moreover, the two stretching vibrational peaks of the \u2212\u2212SO3\u2212 group were still observed in the ATR-FTIR spectrum of poly(U\u2212ea/sb) (Figure 1b). Differences in the ATR-FTIR spectra of the polymers and monomers suggested that the ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of benzoxazine occurred to form bulk structures at a temperature of greater than 140 \u25e6C. Thermal ROP is a typical polymerization reaction of the benzoxazine monomer. At the start of ROP, the oxazine ring forms C positive ions and iminium ions. With the increase in the temperature, the electrophilic substitution reaction of the C positive ions is favored for chain growth, which in turn accelerates the rate of ROP and finally forms a polymer with a high molecular weight; hence, the absorption peaks corresponding to the oxazine ring skeleton in the ATR-FTIR spectra disappeared. The difference between the ATR-FTIR spectra of poly(U\u2212ea) and poly(U\u2212ea/sb) revealed that heating curing did not destroy the sulfobetaine structure of poly(U\u2212ea/sb) and that the presence of quaternary ammonium salts rendered excellent antifouling properties to the poly(U\u2212ea/sb) coating.\nPolymers 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 17\nthe syntheses of U\u2212ea and U\u2212ea/sb did not alter the isolated =C\u2013H groups of the long side\nchain.

In addition, as shown in Figure 4 tensile tests were carried out on both\ncoatings, with poly(U\u2212ea/sb) showing higher tensile strength (11.84 MPa) and elongation\nat break (6.45%) than poly(U\u2212ea) (4.41 MPa and 0.59%, respectively). The corresponding\ntoughness and elastic modulus of the poly(U\u2212ea/sb) and poly(U\u2212ea) coatings were 49.25\nMJm\u22123 and 378.51 MPa and 1.16 MJm\u22123 and 580.41 MPa, respectively. These results re-\nvealed that the addition of sulfobetaine significantly reduced the elastic modulus and in-\ncreased the toughness of the poly(U\u2212ea/sb) coating. In summary, the addition of sulfobe-\ntaine exerts some positive effects on substrate adhesion and the mechanical properties of\nthe coating.\nFigu e 3. Basic performance tests for poly(U\u2212ea) and poly(U\u2212ea/sb) coatings: (a) DSC; (b) TGA; (c) DTG; (d) WCA; (e) adhesion forc measurements for poly(U\u2212ea) and poly(U\u2212ea/sb); (f) statistical adhesion force measurements for poly(U\u2212ea) and poly(U\u2212ea/sb), each sample was measured for three times.\nThe thermal stability of the poly(U\u2212ea/sb) coating was investigated by TGA (based on the initial temperature, that is, the degradation temperature at 5% weight loss). As shown in Figure 3b,c, the poly(U\u2212ea/sb) coating started to decompose at 205 \u25e6C, and the test ended with a residual carbon content of 18.0 wt%. Clearly, the structure resulting from the complete ROP of the U\u2212ea/sb monomer and the cross-linking of the reactive sites of the benzene ring side chains allowed the introduction of a more stable sulphobetaine moiety, indicative of better thermal stability. Static WCA is one of the key indicators to evaluate the hydrophilicity of the material surface. Figure 3d shows the results obtained. As zwitterionic polymers com-\nPolymers 2023, 15, 2383 9 of 17\nprise the same cationic and anionic group units, they can react with water molecules via electrostatic interactions, forming a strong hydration layer to enhance hydrophilicity. Therefore, the change in the WCA can further confirm the successful preparation of the sulfobetaine-functionalized benzoxazine coatings. The WCA of the poly(U\u2212ea) coating was 95.2\u25e6 \u00b1 1.9\u25e6, indicative of significant hydrophobicity; this result was in agreement with the low surface energy and strong hydrophobicity of the polybenzoxazine coating. The inherent hydrophobicity of polybenzoxazine was attributed to the crosslinking of unsaturated aliphatic chains on the benzene ring. With the increase in the crosslinking density of the long side chains, the resistance of the polar phenolic hydroxyl groups to interact with water molecules also increased. Compared with that of the control benzoxazine coating poly(U\u2212ea), the hydrophilicity of the poly(U\u2212ea/sb) coating was significantly higher, and the CA decreased to 37.6\u25e6 \u00b1 4.1\u25e6, corresponding to a decrease of 60.52%. The CA test results indicated that the hydrophilicity of the coating was considerably improved because of the successful grafting of sulfobetaine onto the oxazine ring. When water drops were dropped onto the poly(U\u2212ea/sb) film surface, the water drops spread rapidly. This phenomenon was attributed to the high surface tension of the poly(U\u2212ea/sb) coating, which enhanced the interaction between sulfobetaine and water molecules. The CA test results revealed that the poly(U\u2212ea) layer was hydrophobic and exhibited low adhesion to water; in contrast, owing to the abundance of cations and anions in the poly(U\u2212ea/sb) coating, it exhibited hydrophilicity and high adhesion to water. The results obtained from the water adhesion tests of poly(U\u2212ea) and the poly(U\u2212ea/sb) coatings shown in Figure 3e provided strong evidence. Figure 3f shows the results of adhesion force statistics. Clearly, the test results revealed that compared to the poly(U\u2212ea) coating, the poly(U\u2212ea/sb) coating exhibited a higher surface adhesion to water and that the average adhesion force of the poly(U\u2212ea/sb) coating to water was 0.57 mN, while that of the poly(U\u2212ea) coating was only 0.44 mN. This test result was in agreement with the CA test results."

The glass transition temperature of poly(U\u2212ea/sb) was slightly lower than that of poly(U\u2212ea) due to the decrease in crosslinking density and increased distance between molecular segments (Figure 3), which resulted in a reduction in hardness and brittleness. Zwitterion promotes the ring-opening addition of the oxazine ring, in which active methylene reacts strongly with electrophilic groups on the substrate, resulting the adhesion of the coating to the substrate was significantly improved after amphoteric ionization. In addition, as shown in Figure 4 tensile tests were carried out on both coatings, with poly(U\u2212ea/sb) showing higher tensile strength (11.84 MPa) and elongation at break (6.45%) than poly(U\u2212ea) (4.41 MPa and 0.59%, respectively).

To examine the antibacterial performance\nof the poly(U\u2212ea/sb) coating, four typical bacteria were used: Gram negative bacteria, viz.\nE. coli (BW 25113) and V. alginolyticus (ATCC 33787) and Gram positive bacteria S. aureus\n(ATCC 25923) and Bacillus. sp (MCCC 1B00342).

In addition, the ability to kill bacteria was quantified by calculating the num-\nber of bacterial colonies on agar plates from different sample isolates relative to the num-\nber of bacterial colonies on the BG samples to estimate the antibacterial rate [33].

P. tricornutum and D. zhanjiangensis algal cell solutions were cultured in f/2 medium with the BG, poly(U\u2212ea), and poly(U\u2212ea/sb) coatings (Figure 8b,c). After 7 days of culture, a high number of P. tricornutum and D. zhanjiangensis cells proliferated in the medium containing BG and poly(U\u2212ea), exhibiting extremely high growth activity. In contrast, the growth activity of algal cells was extremely low in the medium with P. tricornutum and D. zhanjiangensis with cell concentrations of 2.9 (\u00b11.9) \u00d7 105 cell/mL and 1.63 (\u00b10.53) \u00d7 105 cell/mL in the medium with the poly(U\u2212ea/sb) coating, respectively. In contrast, the cell concentrations of P. tricornutum and D. zhanjiangensis in the BG-containing medium were 112.25 (\u00b122.27) \u00d7 105 cell/mL and 30.64 (\u00b11.94) \u00d7 105 cell/mL, respectively. The cell concentrations of P. tricornutum and D. zhanjiangensis in the poly(U\u2212ea)-coated medium were 135.1 (\u00b112.2) \u00d7 105 cell/mL and 41.0 (\u00b12.0) \u00d7 105 cell/mL, respectively. The results confirmed that BG and poly(U\u2212ea) did not inhibit the growth of algal cells and that algal cells were easily attached to the surface, while the poly(U\u2212ea) coating exhibited an algal inhibition rate of >99%. The results of the 7 days algae inhibition experiment revealed that the antifouling properties of the poly(U\u2212ea/sb) coating could last for a long time, which is\ncrucial for practical applications. The plates of BG, poly(U\u2212ea), and poly(U\u2212ea/sb) were\nremoved from the test medium after 7 days of soaking and rinsed with 20 mL of sterile PBS\nto wash off non-adherent lgae. Subseque tly, the three plates were examined for algal\nadherence using a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axio Imager A2, Oberkochen, Germany), and images of five ra dom areas (40\u00d7 magnification, 0.156 mm2/area) of each sample were recorded. The algal coverage on the BG, poly(U\u2212ea), and poly(U\u2212ea/sb) plates was determined by analyzing fluorescence microscopy images using ImageJ software. All results and standard deviations are based on triplicate experiments. The optical photographs of the plates revealed the adherence of a large number of algae to the BG and poly(U\u2212ea) plates, while only a small number of algae adhered to the poly(U\u2212ea/sb) plates (Figure 9a\u2013c). The densities of the algal cell coverage on the surfaces of N. closterium, P. tricornutum, and D. zhanjiangensis in the BG medium were 17.44 \u00b1 2.14%, 19.91 \u00b1 1.44%, and 15.12 \u00b1 1.13%,\nPolymers 2023, 15, 2383 14 of 17\nrespectively (Figure 9d). However, the density of algal cells on the poly(U\u2212ea/sb) coating surface decreased to almost 0%. This phenomenon can be attributed to two reasons. First, the anions and cations on the poly(U\u2212ea/sb) surface act as a physical and energetic barrier\nvia ionic solubilization, and the water molecules in the hydrated layer are tightly bound\ntogether, preventing the adsorption of the algal cells to the surface. Second, because of the\nquaternary ammonium salt structure, the poly(U\u2212ea/sb) coating inhibits the reproduction\nof a large number of algal cells, which can kill the algae adhering to the coating for reducing\nthe number of algal cells adhering to the coating surface.\nPolymers 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 14 of 17 number of algal cells, which can kill the algae adhering to the coating for reducing the number of algal cells adhering to the coating surface.\nFigure 8.

Ex-peri-\nments revealed that the poly(U\u2212ea/sb) coating not only efficiently killed the a ached bac-\nteria and algae but also exhibited a good inhibition effect for the adhesion of non\u2212Specific\nproteins.
