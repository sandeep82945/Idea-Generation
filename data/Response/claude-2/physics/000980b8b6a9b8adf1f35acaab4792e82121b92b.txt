 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Develop real-time diagnostic techniques to monitor ROS levels in vivo during treatment. This could help optimize dosing and administration of ROS-generating therapies. New fluorescence or electrochemical probes could be designed. 

2. Investigate chronic toxicity and long-term safety of ROS-generating nanomaterials. While many show good short-term biosafety, long-term effects need to be studied before clinical use.

3. Simplify the design of ROS-generating nanoplatforms to enable large-scale manufacturing. Complex designs make reproducibility difficult. Focusing on simple but effective platforms could aid translation.  

4. Study differences in ROS regulation between cancer types. Cancers modulate antioxidant capacities differently, so response to therapies may vary. Tailoring platforms to cancer types could improve efficacy.

5. Combine ROS modulation with immune checkpoint inhibitors or other immunotherapies. ROS influences immune cell function. Finding synergies between ROS effects and immune therapies could enhance anticancer response.
