    "abstractText": "Foraminifera, classified in the supergroup Rhizaria, are a common and highly diverse group of mainly marine protists. Despite their evolutionary and ecological importance, only limited genomic data (one partial genome and nine transcriptomic datasets) have been published for this group. Foraminiferal molecular phylogeny is largely based on 18S rRNA gene sequence analysis. However, due to highly variable evolutionary rates of substitution in ribosomal genes plus the existence of intragenomic variation at this locus, the relationships between and within foraminiferal classes remain uncertain. We analyze transcriptomic data from 28 species, adding 19 new species to the previously published dataset, including members of the strongly under-represented class Monothalamea. A phylogenomic reconstruction of Rhizaria, rooted with alveolates and stramenopiles, based on 199 genes and 68 species supports the monophyly of Foraminifera and their sister relationship to Polycystinea. The phylogenomic tree of Foraminifera is very similar to the 18S rRNA tree, with the paraphyletic singlechambered monothalamids giving rise to the multi-chambered Tubothalamea and Globothalamea. Within the Monothalamea, our analyses confirm the monophyly of the giant, deep-sea xenophyophores that branch within clade C and indicate the basal position of monothalamous clades D and E. The multi-chambered Globothalamea are monophyletic and comprise the paraphyletic Textulariida and monophyletic Rotaliida. Our phylogenomic analyses support major evolutionary trends of Foraminifera revealed by ribosomal phylogenies and reinforce their current higher-level classification.",

Despite their evolutionary and ecological importance, only limited genomic data (one partial genome and nine transcriptomic datasets) have been published for this group. Foraminiferal molecular phylogeny is largely based on 18S rRNA gene sequence analysis. However, due to highly variable evolutionary rates of substitution in ribosomal genes plus the existence of intragenomic variation at this locus, the relationships between and within foraminiferal classes remain uncertain. We analyze transcriptomic data from 28 species, adding 19 new species to the previously published dataset, including members of the strongly under-represented class Monothalamea. A phylogenomic reconstruction of Rhizaria, rooted with alveolates and stramenopiles, based on 199 genes and 68 species supports the monophyly of Foraminifera and their sister relationship to Polycystinea. The phylogenomic tree of Foraminifera is very similar to the 18S rRNA tree, with the paraphyletic singlechambered monothalamids giving rise to the multi-chambered Tubothalamea and Globothalamea. Within the Monothalamea, our analyses confirm the monophyly of the giant, deep-sea xenophyophores that branch within clade C and indicate the basal position of monothalamous clades D and E. The multi-chambered Globothalamea are monophyletic and comprise the paraphyletic Textulariida and monophyletic Rotaliida. Our phylogenomic analyses support major evolutionary trends of Foraminifera revealed by ribosomal phylogenies and reinforce their current higher-level classification."

            "text": "Foraminifera are classified in the supergroup Rhizaria that is sister to Alveolata and Stramenopila, and altogether are referred to as the SAR group. Foraminifera is a common group of protists widespread in all marine environments from estuaries to deep-sea trenches, with few lineages also living in freshwater settings (Pawlowski et al., 1999; Holzmann et al., 2003; Murray 2006; Siemensma et al., 2017; Holzmann et al., 2021). The group evolved in the Precambrian, possibly from\nradiolarian-like ancestors with which they form the well-supported group Retaria (Pawlowski and Burki 2009; Burki et al., 2010). Foraminiferal origins date to about 650\u2013900 mya, according to a Bayesian relaxed clock (Groussin et al., 2011). No Precambrian fossils can be assigned unambiguously to the Foraminifera, but the group was presumably represented at that time by naked or single-chambered monothalamous species that may have had proteinaceous tests (i.e., shells), consistent with the appearance of a large paraphyletic assemblage of such lineages as early-diverging branches in ribosomal DNA trees\n* Corresponding author.

Foraminifera possibly played a crucial role in late Precambrian ecosystems, as suggested by study of recent microbialites (Bernhard et al., 2013) and fossil lipid biomarkers (Nettersheim et al., 2019).\nUntil recently, the molecular phylogeny of Foraminifera has been based nearly exclusively on ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes (Pawlowski et al., 2003; Pawlowski 2012; Holzmann and Pawlowski 2017). The current database includes over 4000 sequences from about 600 species representing all extant orders except for the order Lagenida. Phylogenetic studies based on 18S rRNA genes divide Foraminifera into three classes: Monothalamea, Tubothalamea and Globothalamea (Pawlowski et al., 2013). Each of these classes is characterized by specific morphogenetic features. Monothalamea are a paraphyletic group that comprises a tremendous variety of single-chambered forms with organic or agglutinated walls, as well as a few naked (non-testate) forms. The Tubothalamea and Globothalamea are characterized by multichambered agglutinated or calcareous tests that differ in terms of chamber number, shape, and arrangement. While the relationships within the Globothalamea and Tubothalamea have been relatively wellestablished based on 18S rRNA gene sequences, the phylogeny of the Monothalamea remains poorly known. The classification proposed by Pawlowski et al. (2002) subdivides this group into 13 clades, named from A to M. However, this classification has been established based on very limited number of sequences representing 50 species only and it is currently under revision (Pawlowski et al., in prep). The presence of multiple indels and the large variation of evolutionary rates in the ribosomal genes of Foraminifera and their close radiolarian relatives impede any reliable inferences about the branching order of monothalamid clades at the base of the foraminiferal tree.\nAmong the protein-coding genes, single-gene trees for Foraminifera have been inferred from actin (Flakowski et al., 2005, 2006; Krabberod et al., 2017), RNA Polymerase II (Longet and Pawlowski 2007), and alpha- and beta-tubulin (Hou et al., 2013; Krabberod et al., 2017). Both actin and tubulin gene families, however, are not the best phylogenetic markers due to the large number of paralogs. The only foraminiferal genomic and transcriptomic data published until now include the freshwater species Reticulomyxa filosa (Glockner et al., 2014), seven rotaliid and one miliolid species (Sierra et al., 2013). These analyses confirmed the monophyly of Rotaliida but contributed little to resolving the relationships of other groups, especially within Monothalamea.\nThe limited amount of genomic data available for Foraminifera reflects various factors: the difficulty of culturing most species and the lack of access to well-established cultures of the few cultivable species. With the notable exception of the freshwater R. filosa (Nauss 1949; Glockner et al., 2014), all other foraminiferal genomic and transcriptomic data have been obtained using multiple specimens that have been sorted from environmental samples, cleaned, and characterized. Only recently have new single-cell RNA extraction methods helped to override this limitation, providing high-quality material for exploring the transcriptomics of uncultured protists (Yan et al., 2019).\nHere, we report 19 additional transcriptomes of Foraminifera, including a wide range of species from all major taxonomic groups. We analyzed these transcriptomes in order to revise the molecular phylogeny of Foraminifera, focusing on relationships among Monothalamea and between them and the two multi-chambered classes: Globothalamea and Tubothalamea."

The other 16 species were obtained in much shallower water (<300 m depth), with nine originating from Patagonian fjords, three from Greenland fjords, three from the Faroe Islands and Svalbard, and one from the Gulf of Eilat (Table S1). Except for the large-sized xenophyophores, which were picked directly from freshly-collected sediment core surfaces, all specimens were sorted from sieved sediment samples, washed in prefiltered seawater and stored in RNA-later until processing, either in the refrigerator or frozen at \u2212 80 \u25e6C. Fragments of freshly-collected xenophyophores were broken off and preserved in RNA-later (Qiagen, Germany), and parts of the branching cellular system was later dissected from these fragments."

Based on these sequences, we used blastp from the blast + tools suite (Camacho et al., 2009) to extract homologous sequences from the newly sequenced Foraminifera transcriptomes. Only hits with a minimum evalue of 1E-05 were considered. For all species, the three homologous contigs with the lowest e-values were chosen for each of the 229 genes tested. Reciprocal best blastp hit to the existing ortholog set was used to exclude paralogous sequences. Corresponding sequences were extracted and aligned with their corresponding reference sequences using MAFFT (Katoh and Standley 2013) option L-INS-i. Based on these alignments, sequences were manually curated, and those that were poorly aligned were removed. Twelve genes were removed from the analysis for lack of good quality sequences, leaving 217 genes from the 229 protein-coding genes tested. These alignments were trimmed with BMGE using a BLOSUM75 matrix, a minimum block size of 5 and a gap rate cut-off of 0.3 (Criscuolo and Gribaldo 2010). Independent trees were generated from the 217 alignments using RAxML v. 8.2 using PROTGAMMALG model and 100 bootstrap replicates (Stamatakis 2014). Three trees where the foraminiferal origin of the genes was not clear were considered of poor quality and corresponding alignments were discarded. Fifteen trees highlighting the putative presence of paralogous sequences were also removed. Finally, a total of 199 alignments were concatenated using SCaFoS (Roure et al., 2007) and new trees were generated from this super matrix using Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood (ML) analyses. The ML analysis were performed with RAxML v.8.2 using PROTGAMMALG and 1000 bootstrap replicates, and IQ-Tree v.1.6 (Nguyen et al., 2015) using LG + G and 1000 ultrafast (Hoang et al., 2018) and standard bootstrap replicates. Bayesian Inference was conducted using ExaBayes v. 1.5 (Aberer et al., 2014) with GTR + G model, running four independent chains in parallel until topological convergence was achieved (average standard deviation of split frequencies (ASDSF) < 5%, at least 10,000 generations) sampling every 500th generation starting from a parsimony tree. After convergence, the extended majority consensus trees with a burnin proportion of 0.5 were calculated using consense (implemented in the ExaBayes package)."

The tree for the Monothalamea and Tubothalamea (Fig. S1) confirms the position of the three morphologically identified xenophyophore species branching within clade C, together with Hippocrepina indivisa and Toxisarcon taimyr. It also confirms the position of Psammophaga fuegia branching within clade E, and Hippocrepina hirudinea within clade D. Regarding the two morphologically unidentified monothalamids, the 18S tree indicated that the undetermined allogromiid (undet monothalamid) branches in clade B as sister group to Psammosphaera, while the undetermined saccamminid branches within clade F, as sister to Hemisphaerammina. The 18S rRNA analysis also confirms the position of previously sequenced miliolids (Sorites orbiculus and Quinqueloculina seminula) as well as that of R. filosa.\nThe 18S rRNA tree of Globothalamea (Fig. S2) confirms the morphological classification of all species except Amphistegina sp.

            "text": "Our study reports the first comprehensive phylogenomic analysis of Foraminifera, including all major taxonomic groups of this phylum, for which transcriptomic data is available. Until now, Foraminifera were\nrepresented in eukaryotic phylogenomic trees by only a few species, most of them belonging to the order Rotaliida (Sierra et al., 2013; Sierra et al., 2016; Burki et al., 2020). This situation was also typical of other Rhizaria, which are generally under-represented in phylogenomic studies (Burki et al., 2010; Burki et al., 2013; Burki and Keeling 2014). Our study has changed this situation, by adding 19 new foraminiferal transcriptomes to the nine already existing, meaning that this group is now represented in phylogenomic trees by more species than all other rhizarian taxa combined. Moreover, the new foraminiferal transcriptomes contain a very low proportion of missing data compared to the previous studies, especially regarding the Polycystinea and\nR. Sierra et al.\nMolecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 174 (2022) 107546\n5\nAcantharea (Burki et al., 2010). These high-quality transcriptomes confirm the efficiency of new RNA extraction methods applied to uncultured rhizarian taxa. A recent study by Weiner et al., (2020) also reported on the successful sequencing of a wide range of protist singlecell transcriptomes, including rhizarian lineages, isolated from environmental samples. Together, these data highlight the potential of this method for future phylogenomic and functional diversity studies.\nOverall, the foraminiferal phylogenomic tree reported here (Fig. 1) is in congruence with previous single-gene phylogenies. Its general structure is very similar to the trees published based on 18S rRNA (Pawlowski et al., 2013), actin (Flakowski et al., 2005, 2006), RNA polymerase (Longet and Pawlowski 2007), and beta-tubulin (Hou et al., 2013), as well as small-scale multigene analyses (Groussin et al., 2011; Krabberod et al., 2017). Our phylogenomic analyses confirmed with high support the distinction of the two major classes of Foraminifera: the multichambered Globothalamea and Tubothalamea, and the paraphyly of single-chambered monothalamids (Pawlowski et al., 2013; Adl et al., 2019). The fourth large group, the calcareous Lagenida, is still not represented by any reliable genomic data, which makes it impossible to establish its phylogenetic position. As our study did not add any new data for Tubothalamea, we will focus our discussion on Globothalamea and Monothalamea only.\nFocusing on the ecologically important Globothalamea, our main contribution consists in adding six new transcriptomes of species belonging to the order Textulariida, a group not represented previously in any phylogenomic tree. The Textulariida are common multichambered Foraminifera characterized by an agglutinated test wall. Until now, all available molecular data for this order have been 18S rRNA and actin genes (Pawlowski et al., 2003; Groussin et al., 2011). Our analyses confirm the paraphyletic nature of the Textulariida and its position at the base of the calcareous Rotaliida (Groussin et al., 2011; Holzmann and Pawlowski 2017). They also indicate the sister position of Reophax relative to other Globothalamea, which is congruent with the relatively simple linear test morphology of this genus and micropaleontological studies that reveal it to be one of the early evolving multichambered foraminiferal lineages (Pawlowski et al., 2013). The relationships between other textulariid genera inferred from our data are also in broad agreement with morphotaxonomic classifications, although it is impossible to make any general conclusions about the phylogeny of this order based on our inclusion of only six species.\nRegarding the phylogeny of the Rotaliida, another important order of Globothalamea now represented in phylogenomic trees by nine transcriptomes, the relations inferred from transcriptomic data substantially differ from the 18S phylogenies that comprise many more taxa (Holzmann and Pawlowski 2017). For example, the genera Ammonia and Elphidium are classified together within the superfamily Rotalioidea according to 18S phylogenies but branch far from each other in the multigene tree. The strong support for the cluster of Elphidium, Nonionellina and Globobulimina is also in disagreement with the 18S-based classification of the Rotaliida, which place each of these genera in different superfamilies (Holzmann and Pawlowski 2017). This is also true in the case of Amphistegina and Bulimina, which branch together despite very different morphological features. Interestingly, the genus Amphistegina had presented particular problems, as its phylogenetic position could not be established based on the 18S gene; its unusually fast-evolving 18S sequences place Amphistegina somewhere among the monothalamid clades, despite its hyaline calcareous test, which is characteristic of the order Rotaliida (Pawlowski et al., 2013). Transcriptomic data solves this problem by placing Amphistegina within Rotaliida, although its position within this order remains to be confirmed.\nThe most important contribution of our study concerns the phylogeny of the class Monothalamea. In previous phylogenomic studies, this class was represented by a unique, naked, freshwater species, R. filosa (Glockner et al., 2014). Here, we added transcriptomic data for 10 additional species representing five different clades. The analyses of this\nexpanded dataset reveal some very interesting relationships. First, we confirm the monophyly of the Xenophyophorea, megafauna-sized agglutinated Foraminifera that are common in many parts of the deep sea (Gooday et al., 2017). The three species of this very unusual taxon form a strongly supported monophyletic group, which clusters together with the three other monothalamous species. All of them are classified in clade C according to 18S phylogeny (Pawlowski et al., 2002). The monothalamous clade C is very heterogenous and contains various organic-walled and agglutinated taxa. Placing the xenophyophores within this clade (Pawlowski et al., 2003; Gooday et al., 2017) was quite unexpected, given their large size, often bizarre morphologies, and unusual cellular organization. However, the transcriptomic data apparently confirm the 18S phylogeny, providing new evidence that xenophyophores are not some kind of early evolved group of protists, as suggested by some palaeontologists (e.g., Seilacher et al., (2003)), but a highly derived group of monothalamous Foraminifera (Antcliffe et al., 2011).\nAnother interesting finding concerns the root of the foraminiferal tree. In previous phylogenomic studies the root was placed either with the tubothalamid genus Quinqueloculina (Sierra et al., 2013) or R. filosa (Burki et al., 2013; Sierra et al., 2016; Krabberod et al., 2017). Earlier studies based on single protein families placed the root on Astrammina rara in the beta-tubulin 2 tree (Hou et al., 2013) or Allogromia sp. in the actin 1 and actin 2 trees (Flakowski et al., 2005) and RPB1 tree (Longet and Pawlowski 2007). Our transcriptomic data, however, show Hippocrepinella hirudinea and Psammophaga fuegia at the base of the foraminiferal tree. The former species belongs to monothalamid clade D and is characterized by a relatively large tubular test with an agglutinated wall. The second species represents clade E and is characterized by an organic or agglutinated test and the very particular feature of ingesting mineral grains (Gschwend et al., 2016). Both species may represent some early foraminiferal lineages, but it is probably too soon to consider them as close to the foraminiferal ancestor, especially given the limited number of analyzed monothalamous lineages.\nTo conclude, the phylogenomic data presented here confirm major trends of evolution in Foraminifera revealed by previous studies, with single-chambered, organic-walled, or agglutinated Monothalamea evolving at least twice into more complex multi-chambered Globothalamea and Tubothalamea characterized by agglutinated or calcareous tests. Within Monothalamea, our data confirm that megafauna-sized abyssal Xenophyophorea are a highly evolved lineage of singlechambered Foraminifera. Within Globothalamea, our study further supports the paraphyletic character of agglutinated Textulariida and the monophyly of calcareous Rotaliida.\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\nRoberto Sierra: Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing \u2013 review & editing.
