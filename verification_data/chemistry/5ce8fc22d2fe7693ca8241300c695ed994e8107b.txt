The portion of the text mentioning future research directions is not explicitly highlighted in the provided text. However, the conclusion section often hints at future research directions by summarizing findings and suggesting what these findings imply for future studies. Based on the detailed description of the study's findings and methodologies, one can infer potential future research directions, such as further exploration of the signaling pathways involved in the apoptosis induced by CBEO on SK-MEL-28 cells, or the investigation of CBEO's effects on other cancer cell lines. However, without a specific section labeled as "Future Research Directions" or similar, pinpointing an exact quote is challenging. The text provided is more focused on presenting the current study's methodology, results, and conclusions rather than explicitly outlining next steps for research.
