    "abstractText": "Understanding the competition between brittleness and plasticity in refractory ceramics is of importance for aiding design of hard materials with enhanced fracture resistance. Inspired by experimental observations of crack shielding due to dislocation activity in TiN ceramics [Kumar et al., Int. J. Plast. 27, 739 (2011)], we carry out comprehensive atomistic investigations to identify mechanisms responsible for brittleness and slip-induced plasticity in Ti-N systems. First, we validate a semiempirical interatomic potential against density-functional theory results of Griffith and Rice stress intensities for cleavage (KIc) and dislocation emission (KIe) as well as ab initio molecular dynamics mechanical-testing simulations of pristine and defective TiN lattices at temperatures between 300 and 1200 K. The calculated KIc and KIe values indicate intrinsic brittleness, as KIc KIe. However, KI-controlled molecular statics simulations\u2014which reliably forecast macroscale mechanical properties through nanoscale modeling\u2014reveal that slip plasticity can be promoted by a reduced sharpness of the crack and/or the presence of anion vacancies. Classical molecular dynamics simulations of notched Ti-N supercell models subject to tension provide a qualitative understanding of the competition between brittleness and plasticity at finite temperatures. Although crack growth occurs in most cases, a sufficiently rapid accumulation of shear stress at the notch tip may postpone or prevent fracture via nucleation and emission of dislocations. Furthermore, we show that the probability to observe slip-induced plasticity leading to crack blunting in flawed Ti-N lattices correlates with the ideal tensile/shear strength ratio (I slip plasticity ) of pristine Ti-N crystals. We propose that the I slip plasticity descriptor should be considered for ranking the ability of ceramics to blunt cracks via dislocation-mediated plasticity at finite temperatures.",

Inspired by experimental observations of crack shielding due to dislocation activity in TiN ceramics [Kumar et al., Int. J. Plast. 27, 739 (2011)], we carry out comprehensive atomistic investigations to identify mechanisms responsible for brittleness and slip-induced plasticity in Ti-N systems. First, we validate a semiempirical interatomic potential against density-functional theory results of Griffith and Rice stress intensities for cleavage (KIc) and dislocation emission (KIe) as well as ab initio molecular dynamics mechanical-testing simulations of pristine and defective TiN lattices at temperatures between 300 and 1200 K. The calculated KIc and KIe values indicate intrinsic brittleness, as KIc KIe. However, KI-controlled molecular statics simulations\u2014which reliably forecast macroscale mechanical properties through nanoscale modeling\u2014reveal that slip plasticity can be promoted by a reduced sharpness of the crack and/or the presence of anion vacancies. Classical molecular dynamics simulations of notched Ti-N supercell models subject to tension provide a qualitative understanding of the competition between brittleness and plasticity at finite temperatures. Although crack growth occurs in most cases, a sufficiently rapid accumulation of shear stress at the notch tip may postpone or prevent fracture via nucleation and emission of dislocations. Furthermore, we show that the probability to observe slip-induced plasticity leading to crack blunting in flawed Ti-N lattices correlates with the ideal tensile/shear strength ratio (I slipplasticity ) of pristine Ti-N crystals. We propose that the I slip plasticity descriptor should be considered for ranking the ability of ceramics to blunt cracks via dislocation-mediated plasticity at finite temperatures.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.7.103601\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe functionality of ceramics at temperatures ( 1000 K) of relevance for industrial, engineering, automotive, and nuclear energy applications is generally limited by the inherent tendency to crack (brittleness) of these materials [1] and/or by thermally induced reductions in hardness [2] and strength [3]. These problems are of significant technological, economic, and practical concern [4], especially in safety-critical applications [5,6]. Rational design of ceramics that combine strength and toughness (enhanced fracture resistance) requires identification and understanding of plastic deformation at different length scales and temperatures. This is a very complex task because (i) plasticity typically oppositely affects strength and toughness, (ii) in situ experimental characterization of mechanical properties is often unfeasible, and (iii) ab initio simulations over length scales sufficient to accom-\n*davide.sangiovanni@liu.se\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

Funded by Bibsam.\nmodate extended defects\u2014which control the mechanical behavior of real ceramics\u2014would be overly time-consuming. However, molecular dynamics simulations based on forcefield models carefully trained upon ab initio and experimental data offer possibilities to address this challenge.\nRecent ab initio studies [7\u201311] aimed at identifying electronic-structure origins of toughness and hardness\u2014often correlated to strength in solids [12,13]\u2014in transition-metal carbonitrides, a class of refractory ceramics widely used in high-temperature machining and automotive applications. It has been shown that valence-electron concentration tuning can be employed to control the inherent hardness [8\u201310], strength [14], ductility, and toughness [7,15] of rocksaltstructure (B1) single-crystal defect-free phases. Nonetheless, extended structural defects as dislocations, grain boundaries, and nanosized cracks are inevitably present in industrially manufactured bulk or protective thin-film coating ceramics. During use, these defects may act as weak links, i.e., sites for crack nucleation and growth. Accordingly, the strength and toughness of defect-free crystals [16,17] are ideal upper limits of properties attainable in real ceramics. The role played by extended defects needs to be addressed separately and requires substantial efforts. For this reason, it is desirable to identify properties inherent to single crystals that can readily reflect trends in actual mechanical responses at finite temperatures and over length scales of practical relevance.\n2475-9953/2023/7(10)/103601(18) 103601-1 Published by the American Physical Society\nGriffith (G) and Rice (R) theories, based on linear elasticity, provide useful predictions of the stress-intensity factors (K ) required for unstable crack growth (KGIc ) or dislocation emission during mode-I (KRIe) and mode-II (K R IIe) loading [18,19]. Definitions of K, KIc, KIe, and KIIe can be found in the Supplemental Material (SM) [20]. A material with given crystallographic orientation is indicated to be intrinsically brittle during mode-I loading if KGIc < K R Ie . The criteria for cleavage and emission are based on the anisotropic elastic response of the material, surface energies Es, and unstable stacking-fault energies \u03b3usf . However, the effective material resistance to crack growth or ability to emit dislocations includes effects that are often not well encompassed by elementary properties such as surface and stacking-fault energies [18,21,22]. Moreover, Es and \u03b3usf are quantities difficult to compute at finite temperatures. Thus, direct molecular statics and molecular dynamics simulations are required to achieve comprehensive understanding of material mechanical responses under load.\nRecent experimental investigations revealed surprising resistance to fracture, mediated by dislocation nucleation and/or motion in (typically brittle) TiN [23]. Inspired by that study, here we employ density-functional theory (DFT), molecular statics (MS), and ab initio and classical molecular dynamics (AIMD and CMD) to gain qualitative understanding of the role played by large structural defects (cracks and notches) on the mechanical properties and behavior of TiN and TiNx refractory ceramics. Specifically, we focus on identifying atomistic mechanisms that control the material ability to blunt cracks due to dislocation emission (slip-induced plasticity) in defective supercell models. Moreover, we introduce the Islipplasticity descriptor (based on properties of defect-free single crystals) that correlates with the likelihood of occurrence of slip-induced plasticity at finite temperatures. Results presented for hard Ti-N crystals [24,25] may serve for interpretation of the mechanical behavior of defective B1 carbonitrides in general [15,26\u201330].\nCore findings of brittleness vs plasticity mechanisms and correlation between Islipplasticity and probability to activate slip plasticity leading to crack blunting at finite temperatures are discussed in Sec. III B. In Sec. III A, we validate the semiempirical potential against ab initio and classical simulation results obtained for single crystals and small notched supercells."

Evaluation of KGIc, K R Ie ,\nand KRIIe based on Griffith and Rice criteria\nThe competition between brittle cleavage and dislocation emission for a given crystal orientation and crack-front direction during mode-I loading (opening) can be predicted at temperature T= 0 K from anisotropic linear elasticity theory using the criteria of Griffith and Rice. Rice criterion can also be used to predict the stress intensity KRIIe required to nucleate and move a dislocation along the crack plane during mode-II loading (in-plane shear) of a precracked solid. The theory has been comprehensively reviewed in Refs. [18,19]. However, chapters from Ting\u2019s book [38] facilitate implementation. Briefly, calculations of KGIc , K R Ie , and K R IIe require knowledge of the material elastic tensor Ci j , unrelaxed surface energy Es,unrel of the crack plane, and unstable stacking-fault energy \u03b3usf along a slip plane inclined by an angle \u03b8 to the fracture surface with Burgers vector orthogonal to the crack-front direction:\nKGIc = [ 2 Es,unrel \u22121 22 ]1/2 , (1)\nKRIe = [ \u03b3usf \u03b8 \u22121 11 ]1/2 /F12(\u03b8 ), (2)\nKRIIe = [ \u03b3usf \u22121 11 ]1/2 .

(S1)\u2013 (S3) in SM [20]) during mode-I loading are (1\u030401)[101] and (101)[101\u0304]. Thus, the most likely emission planes are inclined \u03b8= \u00b145\u25e6 to the fracture plane. In Eqs. (1) and (2), \u2212122 and \u03b8 \u2212111 are elements of the inverse of and \u03b8 matrixes. is the Stroh energy tensor, which can be calculated solving an eigenvalue equation and knowing the material elastic tensor\nC [19]. \u03b8 is the Stroh energy tensor in a coordinate system rotated about the crack-front axis by an angle \u03b8 . F12(\u03b8 ) is a geometrical factor [19]. For evaluation of KRIIe, we consider a B1 lattice with crack plane on (110), crack front parallel to [001], and emission on (110)[11\u03040].\nThe surface energy (unrelaxed and relaxed) and generalized stacking-fault energy surface are obtained by DFT and MS following standard 2D-periodic supercell calculation procedures (see, for example, Ref. [39] for Es and Ref. [40] for \u03b3usf ). In DFT, we converge Es and \u03b3usf values with respect to k-point grid thicknesses and cutoff energies. The elastic constants of TiN obtained by MEAM and DFT+GGA are taken from Refs. [36] and [7]. Here, we also compute the elastic properties using the LDA approximation. As shown in Sec. III A, GGA and LDA values can be considered as lower\n103601-2\nand upper bounds for KGIc , K R Ie , and K R IIe. Table I summarizes results of Ci j, Es, \u03b3usf , KGIc , K R Ie , and K R IIe."

K-controlled simulations portray the macroscale mechanical response of a crack subject to remote stresses from an atomistic perspective. They provide reliable fracture toughness KKCIc values and allow studying the effect of crack sharpness and geometry on the competition between brittle cleavage and emission.\nTheory and methods are detailed in Refs. [18,19]. In short, we employ square TiN and TiNx plates with (i) (001) crack surface, [010] crack-front direction for mode-I; and (ii) (110) crack surface, [001] crack-front direction for mode-II. The supercell is periodic along the crack-front direction. The thickness is \u22481.7 nm. Atoms in the frame region centered at the crack tip are sequentially displaced by incrementing the crack-tip stress intensity KI or KII at steps of 0.02 MPa\u221a\nm. Calculation of the displacements requires computing the\ncomplex roots with positive imaginary part of a characteristic fourth-order equation, where the coefficients depend on the elastic compliance tensor rotated according to the orientation of the defective lattice. All, except frame atoms, are relaxed via conjugate-gradient energy minimization at each K increment. The tolerances are set to 10\u201314 for relative energy changes and 10\u201314 eV/\u00c5 for forces. The interactions among atoms on opposite sides of the crack plane are screened over \u22481 nm. For mode-II loading we test only atomically sharp cracks. For mode I, we perform simulations with crack planes of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5 atomic-layer heights. No atoms are removed for zero-height cracks. Half rows of atoms are deleted in the other cases. The plates are constructed with equal number of atomic layers above and below the crack. We investigate plate-area effects on computed quantities (see Sec. III A)."

These observations motivate MS calculations of the energy required to nucleate (line\n103601-3\nenergy) and stress necessary to move (Peierls stress [41]) dislocations in TiN vs TiNx systems. Proper evaluation of these properties would require corrections that compensate for spurious dislocation-dislocation elastic interactions (see, e.g., Refs. [42,43]).

Line energies and Peierls stresses aid interpretation of results to be presented in Sec. III.\nThe initial dislocation-core structures are created using ATOMSK [44]. The size of supercells varies between 105 and 106 atoms. The supercells contain two mirrored dislocation dipoles aligned perpendicular to the glide plane (see, e.g., Fig. 1 in Ref. [43]). The relationships between Cartesian and crystallographic axes are x//Burgers vector direction [11\u03040], y//dislocation-line direction [001], and z//slip-plane normal direction [110]. Conjugate gradient energy minimization is used to relax the atomic positions and the supercell aspect ratio while imposing orthogonality of the simulation box.\nFor representation of the dislocation core, the Nye tensor was calculated following Hartley et al. [45] with a cutoff of 3 \u00c5 and an exclusion angle of 15 \u00b0. The Nye tensor is the gradient of the inverse of the transpose of the lattice distortion. The lattice distortion is calculated as difference between the atomic positions in a lattice containing a dislocation and in the perfect crystal. We qualitatively compare the dislocation line energies of TiN and TiNx. The line energies are obtained by subtracting the total energy of a defective supercell from the energy of a dislocation-free supercell of the same stoichiometry. Converged energy per unit length is achieved by sequentially increasing the lateral supercell size\u2014from \u22485 to \u2248 50 nm along the x direction\u2014to enlarge the dislocation-free regions. For Peierls stress estimations, simple-shear strain of the plane normal to the dislocation line is incremented at steps of 0.02% until dislocation motion is observed.\nB.

AIMD tensile and shear deformation of single-crystal supercells is modeled at temperatures of 300, 600, 900, and 1200 K using 576-atom supercells, as detailed in previous studies [16,17].

Vacancy ordering allows to maintain the same point-group symmetry in supercells with different orientations. During thin-film growth, vacancy formation or incorporation occurs at random positions [50]. Thermodynamics, however, can produce short- and long-range vacancy ordering. Ordered TiNx variants have been predicted by DFT\nto be stable at low temperature [51] and experimentally reported for TiN0.82 [52\u201354] and TiN0.45\u22120.61 [52,55] single crystals. Although the TiN0.9375 structure employed herein has not been previously observed, it serves (in addition to TiN) to demonstrate correlation between mechanical properties of single-crystal and defective lattices.\nSingle-crystal supercells are initially equilibrated via NPT sampling. Then, tensile and shear strain is incremented by 2% every 3 ps, as in AIMD simulations [16,17]. The maximum stresses withstood during AIMD and CMD mechanical testing correspond to ideal tensile \u03c3T or shear \u03b3S strengths.

            "text": "A. Validation of semiempirical potential for intrinsic material properties\n1. Theoretical KGIc, K R Ie, K R IIe, and K-controlled MS simulations\nAccording to Griffith and Rice criteria, a crystal lattice with given crack surface and crack-front direction is prone to brittle cleavage during mode-I loading if KGIc < K R Ie . Nucleation and emission of dislocations delays or prevents cracking otherwise. KGIc and K R Ie are computed using Eqs. (1) and (2) for TiN and TiNx. For mode-I loading, we consider cracks on (001) with [010] front direction. We also derive KRIIe for in-plane shear loading [crack on (110) plane] using Eq. (3). MS calculations yield the elastic constants, surface energies Es, fracture energy Es,unrel, and the unstable stacking-fault energy \u03b3usf of the slip system {110} \u300811\u03040\u3009, which has the highest Schmid factor during [001] tension. The KGIc , K R Ie , and KRIIe of TiN are also computed via DFT+PBE and DFT+LDA. The low accuracy of semilocal functionals (as PBE or GGA in general) for surface-energy predictions has been discussed in various studies [56\u201358]. PBE typically underestimates surface\nenergies, while LDA (although accidentally) is often more accurate [57\u201361]. On the other hand, the LDA overestimates the elastic constants and consequently also \u22121j j in Eqs. (1)\u2013(3). Thus, PBE and LDA values define reasonable lower and upper bounds to KGIc , K R Ie , and K R IIe. Table I shows that MS results are within or slightly off PBE and LDA ranges of Ci j , Es,unrel, and \u03b3usf . More importantly, our classical potential predicts KGIc , K R Ie, K G Ic /K R Ie ratios, and K R IIe with accuracy comparable to DFT (Table I). As expected, Griffith and Rice criteria indicate that both TiN(001)[010] and TiNx(001)[010] are brittle, as KRIe \u2248 2 KGIc . A comparison of the ratios KGIc /KRIe indicate that dislocation nucleation and motion is (in principle) more facile in the understoichiometric compound (Table I).\nKI-controlled MS simulations confirm the brittle behavior of TiN ceramics, as the crack propagates along the (001) surface at KKCIc = 1.68 \u00b1 0.01 MPa \u221a m (pure screening) and\nat KKCIc = 1.78 \u00b1 0.01 MPa \u221a\nm [atomically sharp crack; see Figs. 2(a) and 2(b)]. The KKCIc values are 8% and 14% greater than KGIc (= 1.56 MPa \u221a m, Table II). TiNx with atomically\nsharp crack exhibits a KKCIc (1.82 \u00b1 0.01 MPa \u221a\nm) that is nearly equivalent to that of TiN with the same crack shape\n103601-5\nand \u224820% greater than Griffith\u2019s value (Table II). The targeted KKCIc accuracy is reached with plates of area \u22484500 nm2. Invariance of KKCIc values is verified using plate sizes up to\u22487300 nm2 (\u22481.2\u00d7 106 atoms; see Fig. S2). We also control that the nonlinear material response is mainly confined near the crack tip (Fig. S3). The map in Fig. S3 is obtained by the difference of relaxed and linear-elastic atomic displacements for KI = 1.40 MPa \u221am, which is close to critical stressintensity values.\nIn contrast to the brittle behavior of plates with atomically sharp cracks, TiN(001)[010] plates (area \u2248 7300 nm2) with 2, 3, and 5 atomic-layer-thick cracks evidence nucleation of a {110} \u300811\u03040\u3009 edge dislocation at the crack tip. For the 2-atom-thick case, a dislocation forms at KKCI = 1.84 MPa \u221a m but remains confined at the crack tip (Fig. S4). Presence of the dislocation delays fracture up to the critical value KKCIc = 2.20 MPa \u221a m (Fig. S4). Our KKCIc results are consistent with experimental fracture toughness KIc assessed by TiN microcantilever bending (Table II). In the plate with a 3-atom-thick crack, a dislocation nucleates at KKCI = 1.96 MPa \u221a m [Fig. 2(c)] and moves toward the material interior\nfor KKCI = 2.04 MPa \u221a\nm [Fig. 2(d)], indicating improved plastic behavior. A 5-atom-thick crack results in nucleation and emission of a dislocation from the tip at KKCI = 2.04 MPa\u221a\nm (Table II). The results of KI-controlled MS simulations show that the sharpness of the crack qualitatively influences the mechanical behavior of TiN ceramics. Crack propagation is observed for crack layers of 0- and 1-atom height. Nucleation, but not emission of dislocations, is observed for crack layers of 2-atom height. Dislocation nucleation and emission is observed for cracks of 3 and 5 atomic height. It is also important to note that the material mechanical behavior appears to be controlled by\nthe crack opening width alone, that is, qualitatively unaffected by the plate area. This is verified for plates with areas as small as \u224872 nm2 (Fig. S2). For Ti-N systems, supercells of relatively small size correctly capture brittleness or plasticity mechanisms observed in large cells (\u22487300 nm2).\nThe KKCIIe stress intensities for dislocation emission are recorded during KII-controlled shearing of TiN(110)[001] plates with an atomically sharp crack and area \u22487300 nm2. MS simulations, consistent with Rice criterion, show that KKC, TiNIIe > K KC, TiNx IIe (Table II). K KC IIe results, together with KGIc /K R Ie values in Table I, suggest that the presence of anion vacancies assists nucleation and emission of dislocations from the notch tip upon loading. The predictions of MS simulations qualitatively agree with the observations of CMD simulations (Sec. III B) showing more frequent slip-induced crack blunting in TiNx than TiN.\n2. Properties of bulk single crystals and Islipplasticity descriptor\nThe mechanical response to tensile elongation of stoichiometric single-crystal B1 TiN at room temperature has been recently investigated by AIMD simulations [16]. The results showed that the material undergoes brittle cleavage at the yield point, irrespective of the elongation direction [16]. In this work, we perform additional AIMD simulations to investigate the effect of temperature on the mechanical response of B1 TiN. AIMD stress/strain curves evaluated for tensile strain along \u3008001\u3009, \u3008110\u3009, and \u3008111\u3009 are illustrated in Figs. 3(a), 3(c), 3(e), and 3(g). The sudden drops in \u03c3zz tensile stresses beyond yield points indicate occurrence of sudden bond snapping leading to brittle cleavage. Exceptions are \u3008001\u3009 elongation tests at 600 and 1200 K, for which fracture is preceded by gradual bond fraying. Nevertheless, the fracture\n103601-6\nmechanisms observed at different temperatures are similar to that already reported in Ref. [16].\nThe results of CMD simulations [Figs. 3(b), 3(d), 3(f), and 3(h)] are consistent with those of AIMD and suggest that single-crystal B1 TiN is an inherently brittle material. Considering that the MEAM parameters used in CMD had not been optimized for mechanical responses beyond the elastic limit [36], the agreement between CMD and AIMD results is remarkably good (Fig. 3 and Table III). CMD tensile-testing simulations are also used to determine the stress/strain relationships for a vacancy-ordered variant of understoichiometric B1 TiNx (x = 0.9375). The intent of identifying correlations between single-crystal and defective-crystal mechanical responses benefits from an accurate characterization of the properties of different materials. Testing of TiNx serves this purpose, because the MEAM potential used in this work accurately describes both stoichiometric and N-deficient TiN systems [36]. In addition, vacancy ordering allows us to\nreproduce the same crystal symmetry in supercells with different crystallographic orientations relatively to the Cartesian axes.\nAnalogously to the stoichiometric phase, CMD simulations show that pristine TiNx single crystals cleave in all tests. CMD observations would suggest that both TiN and TiNx are equally brittle. Nevertheless, the actual material\u2019s resistance to fracture is affected by its ability to nucleate and emit dislocations from crack tips. This ability can be assessed using the ratio of surface energies (Esurf ) and unstable stacking-fault energies (\u03b3usf ) [62\u201364], which are concepts founded in Griffith and Rice pioneering works [65,66]. Esurf is an estimate of the energy necessary to propagate a crack,\n103601-7\nwhereas \u03b3usf indicates the energy necessary to nucleate a dislocation. Here, we propose that the ideal tensile-to-shear strength ratio (Islipplasticity) obtained from molecular dynamics is a reliable indicator of material\u2019s ability to resist fracture via slip-induced crack blunting: while the tensile strength should correlate with the stress required to open a crack, the shear strength should correlate with the stress necessary to nucleate and move a dislocation from a crack tip. We argue that the reliability of the Islipplasticity descriptor lies in the fact that ideal strengths calculated via molecular dynamics explicitly include nonelastic and vibrational effects at a temperature of interest. Moreover, the computation of ideal tensile and shear strengths at finite temperatures is more practical than determination of surface and unstable stacking-fault free energies.\nThe Islipplasticity descriptor accounts for the Schmid factor (mSchmid), which resolves the applied tension onto a slip plane inclined to the fracture plane. The natural starting point to test validity of the Islipplasticity descriptor is to consider fracture on (001) surfaces, which have lowest formation energy in B1 TiN [39,67] and TiNx [68]. Among the {110} \u300811\u03040\u3009, {001} \u300811\u03040\u3009, and {111}\u300811\u03040\u3009 slip systems, known to operate in B1 nitrides and carbides at room and/or high temperature [69\u201374], the {110} \u300811\u03040\u3009 is the most frequently reported at 300 K [47,70] and, for \u3008001\u3009 tension, has the highest Schmid factor (0.5). Thus, the focus of present AIMD and CMD investigations is on the competition between unstable {001} crack growth and crack blunting via nucleation and motion of {110} \u300811\u03040\u3009\ndislocations. Accordingly, we base our analyses on an Islipplasticity descriptor defined as\nIslipplasticity = m {110}\u300811\u03040\u3009 Schmid\n\u03c3 \u3008001\u3009 T\n\u03b3 {110}\u300811\u03040\u3009 S\n. (4)\nThe ideal tensile strength \u03c3 \u3008001\u3009T is the maximum tensile stress withstood by a pristine crystal prior to {001} cleavage, while the ideal \u03b3 {110}\u300811\u03040\u3009S shear strength corresponds to the maximum shear stress before activation of {110} \u300811\u03040\u3009 slip. The descriptor in Eq. (4) is equivalent to the ductility parameter demonstrated in Ref. [75] to be a reliable indicator of ductility in nanowires under tension.\nThe shear strength \u03b3S of dislocation-free single-crystal B1 TiN and TiNx is evaluated via simple-shear simulations along the {110} \u300811\u03040\u3009 slip system. It is plausible to expect that \u03b3S values encompass both the stress required to nucleate and move a full dislocation. For the case of stoichiometric TiN at room temperature, the ideal shear-strength value calculated by AIMD (\u03b3 {110}\u300811\u03040\u3009S = 46.2 GPa) is much larger than the CMD one (\u03b3 {110}\u300811\u03040\u3009S = 31.8 GPa); see Table III. However, an increase in temperature progressively brings AIMD and CMD values to closer agreement (Table III). Independent DFT investigations [14] of TiN shear-stress/strain relationships at 0 K return an ideal shear strength (\u224831 GPa) and a yield point (\u224814%) that match our CMD results at 300 K (Table III).\n103601-8\nBecause nudging was employed to locate shear instabilities during deformation, the DFT result of Ref. [14] is a solid support to our CMD-predicted shear strength \u03b3 {110}\u300811\u03040\u3009S . The difference between the AIMD prediction of \u03b3 {110}\u300811\u03040\u3009S at 300 K and the value in Ref. [14] is attributed to different supercell sizes, k-point meshes, and cutoff energies.\nThe CMD-calculated ideal strengths of pristine TiN and TiNx crystal models exhibit relatively small differences (Table III). At room temperature, anion vacancies cause a reduction in both tensile (\u22486%) and shear (\u224810%) strength, which translates into a slightly larger Islipplasticity value for TiNx (0.610 \u00b1 0.010) vs TiN (0.582 \u00b1 0.010); see Table IV. As described in Sec. III B, a slightly larger Islipplasticity reflects a substantially improved resistance to fracture in TiNx due to\nmore frequent nucleation and emission of {110} \u300811\u03040\u3009 edge dislocations.\n3. Comparison of edge-dislocation properties in TiN and TiNx\nThe observation of nucleation and motion of dislocations during KI-controlled simulations [Figs. 2(c) and 2(d)] and molecular dynamics (see below) motivates dedicated MS investigations of the properties of these defects. Figures 4(c) and 4(d) show relaxed {110}\u300811\u03040\u3009 edge dislocation cores in TiN and TiNx. The results are obtained for 3D-periodic supercells of constant thickness along the dislocation line (// to [001]) and distance between dislocation dipoles set to half the supercell [110] size (\u224820 nm).\n103601-9\nThe atomistic structure of the relaxed edge-dislocation core in TiN illustrated in Fig. 4(c) is consistent with that predicted by DFT for TiN [49] and like the one observed by electron microscopy for B1 MgO ceramics (Fig. 2 in Ref. [76]). The core structure in vacancy-ordered TiNx resembles that of TiN but with slightly broader atomic displacements along [11\u0304 0] [Fig. 4(d)]. The map of lattice distortions calculated for TiN is mirror symmetric in the plane of view [Fig. 4(c)]. In contrast, Nye analysis reveals a nonsymmetric distribution of lattice distortions in TiNx, which is due to a nonsymmetric arrangement of vacancies around the core [Fig. 4(d)]. For line-energy estimations, we increase the lateral supercell size from \u22485 up to \u224850 nm. Figure 4(a) shows that for [11\u0304 0]-supercell-sizes > 15 nm, the dislocation line energies of B1 TiN and TiNx saturate to \u22485.6 and \u22485.0 eV/\u00c5.\nThe supercells used for MS calculations of Peierls stress \u03c4P have a lateral size of \u224830 nm. The value \u03c4TiNP = 1.27 GPa, Fig. 4(b), is close to the range (\u03c4TiNP = 1.3 \u2212 1.4 GPa)\nobtained by DFT [49]. The agreement may be accidental due to the use of different supercell models. The results obtained for vacancy-ordered TiNx supercells (\u03c4TiNxP = 1.74 GPa) indicate that greater shear stress is required to activate motion of {110}\u300811\u03040\u3009 edge dislocations in the nitrogen-deficient crystal, Fig. 4(b). A higher \u03c4P is likely due to dislocation pinning at vacancy sites. On the other hand, the fact that the line energy estimated for TiN (5.6 eV/\u00c5) is larger than that of TiNx (5.0 eV/\u00c5), Fig. 4(a), is indicative of lower probability for dislocation nucleation in the stoichiometric phase. Estimates of the properties of {110} \u300811\u03040\u3009 edge dislocations aid understanding of slip-induced plasticity (see Sec. III B)."

III A, we have validated our CMD/MEAM description of TiN properties against AIMD and DFT results obtained for single crystals, edge dislocations, and small notched supercells. KGIc /K R Ie ratios in Table I indicate that TiN(001)[010] and TiNx(001)[010] are brittle materials, which is confirmed by KI-controlled MS simulations of plates with atomically sharp cracks [Figs. 2(a) and 2(b)]. Nevertheless, TiN plate models with 3-atom-thick cracks exhibit slip-induced plasticity [Figs. 2(c) and 2(d)], indicating that the crack sharpness has a strong influence on the mechanical behavior. In addition, a comparison of KGIc /K R Ie , K KC IIe (Tables I and II) and dislocation line energies [Fig. 4(a)] indicate that the presence of anion vacancies facilitates dislocation nucleation and emission during mode-I and mode-II loading.\nDuring static K-controlled loading, the outcome of the simulation is uniquely determined by the initial simulation setup. At finite temperatures, instead, different mechanisms may compete and thus affect the simulation outcome. This calls for statistical analyses of the material mechanical behavior at finite temperatures [78]. We aim at gaining a qualitative understanding of the system response by applying tensile\n103601-11\ndeformation to notched supercells via CMD simulations (Fig. 1). The use of supercells of relatively small area b\u00d7 h = 160 nm2 (Fig. 1) allows us to collect statistics at a feasible effort. This is not expected to qualitatively alter our conclusions, because the mechanical behavior of defective Ti-N during K-controlled loading remains unaltered for plate areas between \u224872 and 7300 nm2. However, we verify that an increased supercell thickness (from 0.9 to 17.0 nm along the [010] direction in Fig. 1) does not significantly impact the probability to observe slip-induced plasticity. In this regard, experiments show that dislocation-mediated plasticity is pronounced in samples of 150-nm thickness, whereas nearly absent in 300-nm-thick samples [23].\nIn CMD tensile-testing simulations, the stress intensity at the notch tip is incremented by increasing the vertical length of the simulation box. The procedure avoids biasing the lattice vibrations, as it would occur in K-controlled simulations (Sec. II A 3). The relative speed of accumulation of tensile vs shear stress at the notch tip\u2014which corresponds to different degrees of mode-I/mode-II stress intensities\u2014is tuned by changing the width of the void region V in Fig. 1. The under-\nstanding of effects induced by mixed mode-I/mode-II loading on mechanical properties aids interpretation of the behavior of protective ceramic coatings during industrial operation.\nStarting with supercells of 2.6-nm thickness, independent CMD tensile tests are carried out for each V parameter\nat each investigated temperature. Tensile loading of notched TiN and TiNx with V > 0.4b leads, with few exceptions,\nto brittle fracture via either crack growth or sudden cleavage across the entire supercell. This is explained by the fact that V > 0.4b induce a too rapid accumulation of tensile\nstress in comparison to the rate of shear-stress increase at the notch tip. Conversely, CMD testing of supercells with V\n0.4b exhibits competition between crack propagation and slip-induced plasticity. A separate analysis of atomic displacements in MS calculations reveals that elongation of supercells with V > 0.4b essentially corresponds to pure mode-I\nloading. In contrast, the displacements in tensile-strained supercells with V 0.4b are compatible with mixed modeI (\u224885 \u2212 95%)/mode-II (\u224815 \u2212 5%) loading. This suggests that accumulation of shear stress at the crack tip is responsible for the more frequent activation of slip-induced crack blunting in supercells with V 0.4b.\nAn example of competition between brittleness and slipinduced plasticity is illustrated by Figs. 6 and 7. Independent (i.e., different initial atomic velocities) CMD tensile tests are performed for notched TiN with V = 0.4b at room temperature. Atoms are colored according to local values of uniaxial \u03c3zz [Figs. 6(a) and 7(a)] and shear \u03c3xz [Figs. 6(b) and 7(b)] stresses. The stress color scales are logarithmic: small color variations correspond to a relatively large change\n103601-12\nin stress. Despite starting with supercells of equal shapes and using equal strain rates, the simulations evidence qualitatively different mechanical responses to stress. Figure 6 shows unstable crack growth, whereas Fig. 7 illustrates a case of slip-induced crack blunting due to nucleation and\nemission of {110} \u300811\u03040\u3009 edge dislocations from the notch tip. The phenomenon, known to operate in metals [64], is unusual for hard ceramics. Below we provide an interpretation for the contrasting mechanical behaviors of Figs. 6 and 7.\n103601-13\nFigures 6(a), 6(b) and 7(a), 7(b) show CMD snapshots of TiN supercells elongated by 5% at timeframes closely preceding (\u22481 ps) crack growth (Fig. 6) or slip-induced plasticity (Fig. 7). A strain of 5% produces tensile- and shear stresses which have local maxima at the notch tips. However, thermal fluctuations temporarily generate greater\ntensile-to-shear-stress ratios around the notch tip of Figs. 6(a) and 6(b) than in Figs. 7(a) and 7(b) [compare shear-stress color intensities in Figs. 6(b) and 7(b)]. In the case presented in Fig. 6(a), a high tensile stress causes breakage of Ti\u2013N bonds [Fig. 6(c)], ultimately leading to brittle fracture [Fig. 6(d)]. Conversely, an increase in tensile stress accompanied by a comparably rapid accumulation of shear stress [Fig. 7(a) and 7(b)] assists nucleation of an edge dislocation [Fig. 7(c)]. A further increase in strain triggers dislocation emission, which blunts the notch and impedes crack growth [Fig. 7(d)]. The beneficial effect of shear-stress accumulation on slip-induced plasticity at crack tips is also indicated by K-controlled simulations. Figure 2 shows that while TiN plates with atomically sharp cracks fail by crack propagation, TiN plates with 3-atomic-layer-thick cracks nucleate and emit dislocations, which is similar to the results in Fig. 7. In Fig. S5 of the SM [20], we analyze the atomic stresses in the plates of Fig. 2. Subject to an equal mode-I load (KI = 1.4 MPa \u221am), large TiN plates with cracks of different heights accumulate approximately the same tensile stress, Figs. S5(a), S5(a1) and S5(b), S5(b1). However, as indicated by colored arrows in Figs. S5(d) and S5(d1), the tip of the 3-atomic-layer-thick crack is subject to greater shear stress, which is considered the reason for dislocation nucleation and emission observed in Figs. 2(c) and 2(d).\nFigure 8 describes a typical pathway for dislocation nucleation and emission from a notch tip. In Figs. 8(a) and 8(a\u2032), the supercell box is elongated by 8%. After \u22481 ps at 8% strain, the material dissipates part of accumulated stress via rupture of all Ti\u2013N bonds that connect [010] lattice rows labeled as A and B in Fig. 8(b\u2032). Due to sufficiently large shear stress at the notch front, part of the crystal below the slip plane penetrates the lattice, creating a stacking fault; see Figs. 8(c) and 8(c\u2032). The defect remains at the notch tip until the uniaxial strain is increased to 9% [Figs. 8(d) and 8(d\u2032)], which leads to formation of a {110} \u300811\u03040\u3009 edge dislocation. Subsequently, the dislocation core moves at an average speed of \u224822 \u00c5/ps across the entire crystal [see Figs. 8(e), 8(e\u2032), and 8(f)] and exits within \u22483.5 ps from the bottom-right surface. The notch height\u20142 atomic layers in Figs. 8(a) and 8(a\u2032)\u2014increases to 3 atomic layers in Figs. 8(e) and 8(e\u2032).\nAlthough not directly comparable to mechanical tests by Kumar et al. [23], CMD results of dislocation-driven crack blunting in TiN crystals at 300 K are consistent with the observations of that work. Figure 9(a) shows the percentage of tensile tests exhibiting slip-induced crack blunting in notched TiN and TiNx vs the I slip plasticity value computed at the same temperature. A total of 350 for TiN and 140 for TiNx CMD simulations is performed at each investigated temperature (300, 600, 900, and 1200 K). Remarkably, Islipplasticity values display a nearly monotonic relationship with the likelihood that dislocation-induced plasticity is activated in TiN or TiNx at a given temperature [Fig. 9(a)]. The results of Fig. 9(a) demonstrate that the ideal strength values calculated for single crystals can be used to forecast trends in mechanical response of defective lattice models. However, the effect of slip-induced plasticity may be of practical relevance only at the nanoscale. Indeed, the experiments of Ref. [23]\n103601-14\nshowed remarkable dislocation activity only for samples with thickness below 300 nm. Additional CMD simulations at 300 K allow us to verify that slip-induced crack blunting remains active in supercells with thickness up to 17.0 nm (\u2248250 000 atoms). We carried out 70 independent CMD tests (10 for each V ) for supercells with thicknesses of 0.9, 5.9, 8.5, and 17.0\nnm. Results in Fig. 9(b) indicate that (except for the thinnest models) the probability for dislocation-mediated crack blunting remains constant with increasing supercell thickness.\nBefore conclusions, we briefly compare the mechanical response observed in TiN and TiNx notched models. The results in Fig. 9(a) indicate that the nitrogen-deficient phase is more resistant to fracture, due to improved plasticity. The effect is attributed to a lower energetic cost for nucleation and emission of dislocations [Tables I, II, and Fig. 4(a)]. Once formed, dislocations are emitted relatively rapidly from the notch tip, because the locally accumulated shear stresses [Fig. 7(b)] are much larger than Peierls stresses [Fig. 4(b)]. Dislocation nucleation and motion dissipate stress, thus preventing crack opening. We remind that the vacancy-ordered TiNx variant used in this work has not been previously observed but serves for supporting the analysis on the correlation between properties of pristine and defective supercells."

            "text": "Motivated by surprising experimental observation of dislocation-mediated flaw tolerance in TiN, we carried out ab initio and classical atomistic investigations to shed light on atomic-scale mechanisms that regulate the competition between brittle fracture and slip-induced crack blunting in these ceramics. Molecular statics mode-I controlled simulations demonstrate the intrinsic brittleness of TiN with an atomically sharp crack. However, the observation of dislocation nucleation and emission in TiN with a crack of 3-atomic-layer thickness suggests that the stress condition at the crack tip dictates the competition between brittle fracture and crack blunting. Moreover, calculations of dislocation line energies\nas well as KII-controlled molecular statics simulations indicate that the presence of anion vacancies facilitates dislocation nucleation and emission. Molecular dynamics simulations of notched supercell models under tension show that a too rapid accumulation of tensile stress at the notch front inevitably leads to crack growth and brittle failure. Conversely, a comparably rapid increase in shear and tensile stress may activate dislocation nucleation and emission, thus blunting the notch. Crack blunting, with associated stress dissipation, prevents (or delays) crack growth. We propose that a descriptor [Islipplasticity in Eq. (4)] readily obtainable from calculations of ideal strengths of pristine single-crystal phases may forecast trends in dislocation plasticity and related improvement in resistance to brittle fracture of defective ceramics. The Islipplasticity descriptor is suggested as convenient alternative to Griffith and Rice criteria for assessing the competition between brittleness and plasticity at finite temperatures."
