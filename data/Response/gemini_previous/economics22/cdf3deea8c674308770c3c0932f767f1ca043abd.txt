1. **Investigate the impact of internal compensation gap and compensation level on firm performance in different industries and countries.** This study focused on the energy industry in China, but it would be interesting to see if the results hold true in other industries and countries. This would help to determine the generalizability of the findings and provide insights into the factors that moderate the relationship between compensation and performance.


2. **Examine the relationship between internal compensation gap, compensation level, and firm performance over time.** This study looked at the relationship between these variables over a five-year period, but it would be interesting to see how the relationship changes over a longer period of time. This would help to determine whether the relationship is stable or if it changes over time.


3. **Investigate the impact of internal compensation gap and compensation level on firm performance in different economic conditions.** This study was conducted during a period of economic growth, but it would be interesting to see how the relationship between these variables changes during a period of economic downturn. This would help to determine whether the relationship is robust to changes in the economic environment.


4. **Examine the relationship between internal compensation gap, compensation level, and firm performance in different types of firms.** This study focused on listed companies, but it would be interesting to see if the results hold true for private companies, family-owned businesses, and non-profit organizations. This would help to determine the generalizability of the findings and provide insights into the factors that moderate the relationship between compensation and performance in different types of firms.


5. **Investigate the impact of internal compensation gap and compensation level on firm performance in different stages of the organizational life cycle.** This study did not consider the stage of the organizational life cycle, but it would be interesting to see if the relationship between these variables changes as firms move from the start-up phase to the growth phase to the maturity phase. This would help to determine whether the relationship is different for firms at different stages of development.
