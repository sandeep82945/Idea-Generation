    "abstractText": "A quantitative understanding of the dynamics of bee colonies is important to support global efforts to improve bee health and enhance pollination services. Traditional approaches focus either on theoretical models or data-centred statistical analyses. Here we argue that the combination of these two approaches is essential to obtain interpretable information on the state of bee colonies and show how this can be achieved in the case of time series of intra-day weight variation. We model how the foraging and food processing activities of bees affect global hive weight through a set of ordinary differential equations and show how to estimate the parameters of this model from measurements on a single day. Our analysis of 10 hives at different times shows that the estimation of crucial indicators of the health of honey bee colonies are statistically reliable and fall in ranges compatible with previously reported results. The crucial indicators, which include the amount of food collected (foraging success) and the number of active foragers, may be used to develop early warning indicators of colony failure.",

Obtaining information about the health of bee colonies is essential to understand how this happens and to identify measures that can prevent this from happening. Herein, we built a mathematical model of the daily dynamics of hives that allows such information to be extracted without detailed and expensive measurements. Based only on measurements of how the weight of the hive changes during the day, our model can be used to estimate how many bees are collecting food, how successful they are, and how much time they spend outside the hive. Due to its simplicity, the model presented here can be applied to a wide range of hive scale systems and help beekeepers track how healthy and productive their bees are.\nPLOS Computational Biology | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010880 March 1, 2023 1 / 22\na1111111111 a1111111111\nOPEN ACCESS\nCitation: Arias-Calluari K, Colin T, Latty T, Myerscough M, Altmann EG (2023) Modelling daily weight variation in honey bee hives.

            "text": "There is growing concern that crop pollination by honey bees might no longer be a sustainable operation in the near future [1]. Single and combined stress from pesticides, parasites, and diseases have led to an increase in bee colony mortality worldwide [2\u20137]. Despite beekeepers\u2019 efforts to control pests and diseases, annual colony losses of about 30% are frequently reported in countries across Europe [8] and North America [9\u201311]. Automated methods to track the status of hives can play a key role in helping beekeepers prevent the death of colonies [12\u201316].\nThe social organization of a bee colony is complex and relies on positive and negative feed-\nback loops to maintain homeostasis. Feedback loops can help buffer the effect of stressors or cause snowballing effects which in some cases precipitate colony death. A well-known feedback loop that has been hypothesized to accelerate the failure of the colony is the one that regulates the ontogeny of foraging [17]. In a bee colony, workers typically spend the first few days of their adult life performing various maintenance, defence, and care tasks before transitioning into foragers [18]. The presence of a sufficiently large number of foragers inhibits the transition of younger bees into foragers [17, 19]. Under ideal conditions, this ensures enough bees are performing in-hive tasks, and that the colony is able to process all the food brought back by the foragers and to raise the next generation of workers. If an environmental stress reduces the number of foragers, then this same mechanism ensures the rapid replacement of the foraging force. With fewer foragers, the transition of younger bees into foragers is increased and the foragers\u2019 population is rapidly replenished. Under sustained stress, it has been hypothesized that this buffering mechanism can lead to generations of workers starting to forage at a younger age, which reduces their life expectancy and the foragers\u2019 population increasingly fast until colony death [20]. Thus, information about the number of forager bees and their activities can provide important guidance about the health of the hive.\nDirectly measuring the number of forager bees is difficult, but the use of new technologies\nprovides opportunities to estimate them from more accessible data [12, 21]. Recently developed affordable and precise balances can easily be fitted to hives in the field to study the longterm weight changes [22] and shorter within-day weight variations of hives [12, 23]. Withinday hive weight variations are clearly visible and exhibit similar patterns that are consistent across multiple day as shown in Fig 1. In the morning, rapid weight loss occurs because foragers leave the hive [24]. For this reason, previous methods have focused on measuring the slope and low point of the morning departure segment of daily hive weight\u2019s curves [24], and have used this measure as likely representing forager activity [25]. However, these phenomenological methods provide limited information about the daily internal dynamics of the hive. Other methods perform piece-wise linear regression analysis where up to five breaking points are suggested after an abrupt change of slope [24, 26]. In particular, these methods do not provide quantitative estimations of the relevant bee activities such as the number of forager bees or the amount of food brought to the hive because the different bee activities are not explicitly modeled. In this paper, we develop a mechanistic mathematical model of the daily dynamics of hives which, in combination with hive weight time series, provides quantitative estimations of key indicators of the state of the hive such as the total number of active forager bees and the average mass of food they bring to the hive in each trip. We start in Sec. 2.1 with our model presentation, its qualitative description, and its main properties. In Sec. 2.2 we present how the parameters can be inferred from data. In Sec. 2.3 we apply our methodology to time series of ten different hives measured across a year and show how in most cases the results lead to biologically meaningful estimations. Finally, in Sec. 3 we summarize our conclusions. A detailed description of our data and computational methods is presented in the Materials and Method section. The data and codes used in our analysis are available in a repository [27].\nPLOS Computational Biology | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010880 March 1, 2023 2 / 22\nto TL, MM, EGA), the Lord Mayor\u2019s Charitable Foundation (TC), and Eldon and Anne Foote Trust (TC).

            "text": "Our aim is to obtain a mechanistic model that contains the essential processes necessary to describe how the weight W of a bee hive changes throughout time t over a daily cycle. Qualitative description. Our model will incorporate the following well-known processes and honey-bee behaviours that are also schematically illustrated in Fig 2:\n1. In the morning, the weight of the hive rapidly falls as foragers leave the hive [24]. This initial\nweight drop usually lasts for a few hours, indicating that the weight loss is only partly counterbalanced by forager bees returning to the hive. A successful forager will return with pollen, nectar, water or propolis. The weight of a forager bee is expected to be higher when they return than when they leave, if the resources they seek are available in their environment.\n2. Around midday, departures and arrivals reach roughly an equilibrium. Hives in environ-\nments with food resources start gaining weight, possibly indicating that the weight of departing foragers is less than the weight of effective foragers returning with food to the colony [24]. The weight increases until all foragers have returned at dusk.\n3. In the late afternoon, the number of departures reduces until they stop completely around\ndusk. Once all the foragers have returned, the hive stops gaining weight.\n4. At night, the weight of a hive declines slowly until dawn due to respiration, food consump-\ntion, and evaporation. The metabolic activity of a bee colony remains high at night because\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010880.g001\nPLOS Computational Biology | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010880 March 1, 2023 3 / 22\nbees actively maintain the temperature of the brood at about 35 \u02daC, as well as humidity and CO2 concentration to optimize development. Bees actively warm the colony by shivering, or cool down and ventilate the hive by evapotranspiration and fanning. These activities require a great deal of movement and, thus, cause honey bees to consume significant amounts of honey at night. Sugars in the honey are broken down to produce energy and exhaled as CO2. A colony also evaporates a large amount of water, either to facilitate\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010880.g002\nPLOS Computational Biology | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010880 March 1, 2023 4 / 22\nbiological processes, concentrate sugars in food stores, or cool down the hive. Moreover, it is likely that a small amount of the weight loss at night results from cleaning activities, with bees likely getting rid of pests, dead bees and chewed brood cell caps throughout the night. The cycle resumes the next day again.\nThe net outcome of the activities described above depends on the hive, the environment,\nand the weather conditions. In favourable environments and at its peak population in summer, a single bee colony can harvest a few kilograms of food in a single day. Most of this weight comes in the form of nectar and honeydew, which generally contains more than 50% water and diluted sugars [28]. Hives in environments with little or no resources may lose more weight than they gain in a day as a consequence of honey consumption inducing respiration and evaporation (i.e., foragers expend more resources than they are able to bring back to the colony).\nMathematical model. We consider the time dependent weight W 2 R\u00fe (measured in g) to depend on the number of forager bees N 2 Z; 0 \ufffd N \ufffd Nmax (measured in bees) and on the food F 2 R\u00fe (measured in g) as\nW\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc F\u00f0t\u00de \u00fe wN\u00f0t\u00de \u00feW0; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere W0 is the constant weight of the hive and w is the (average) weight of a bee. Next we discuss the variation in N(t) and F(t).\nFor mathematical convenience, we model the variation in the number of foragers bees N(t) by focusing on the fraction x 2 R (nondimensional) of all Nmax foragers bees that are inside the hive:\nx \ufffd N\nNmax ) N\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc Nmaxx\u00f0t\u00de: \u00f02\u00de\nWe write the rate of change of x as\ndx dt \u00bc a\u00f0t\u00de\u00f01 x\u00de d\u00f0t\u00dex; \u00f03\u00de\nwhere a(t), measured in 1/s, is the arrival rate of the fraction of forager bees outside the hive and d(t), measured in 1/s, is the departure rate of the fraction of forager bees inside the hive. The inverse of these rates can be thought of as the typical period a bee spends outside and inside the hive, respectively. These terms multiply the fraction of bees outside (1 \u2212 x) and inside (x), respectively. The rate of bees arriving is\nA\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc a\u00f0t\u00de\u00f0Nmax N\u00f0t\u00de\u00de \u00bc a\u00f0t\u00deNmax\u00f01 x\u00f0t\u00de\u00de\nand the rate of bees departing is\nD\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc d\u00f0t\u00deN\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc d\u00f0t\u00deNmaxx\u00f0t\u00de;\nwhere A and D are measured in bees/s. The food inside the hive F(t) increases due to the mass m (measured in g) of food brought in by arriving bees and decreases due to evaporation, respiration, and food consumption, which we model as a constant loss \u2113 (measured in g/s) so that:\ndF dt \u00bc \u2018\u00femA\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc Nmax\u00f0ma\u00f0t\u00de\u00f01 x\u00de\u00de \u2018: \u00f04\u00de\nPLOS Computational Biology | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010880 March 1, 2023 5 / 22\nNotice that F(t) is linear in x and can be computed directly from x(t) and a(t) by integrating the above equation. Substituting F(t) and x(t) in Eq (1) we obtain the time-dependent weight W(t) of the hive, our measurable quantity. This implies that the equations can be solved sequentially, starting from x(t). The final step of our model is to specify the departure d(t) and arrival a(t) rates defined in Eq (3) and then solve for x(t). We will consider a very simple choice for a(t) and d(t)\u2014piecewise constant in t\u2014which allows for an explicit solutions for x (t) and, thus, W(t). Note that more sophisticated models of food inside the hive F(t) could use a time-dependent loss \u2113(t) dependent on temperature, weather variations, or a term proportional to N (or x) to indicate a consumption rate proportional to the number of (forager) bees. Furthermore, more elaborate functions a(t) and d(t), such as delay equations, could be incorporated.\nDay and night cycles. Without loss of generality, in our model, we consider:\nt = 0 to be the time in the morning (around sunrise) at which the bees start exiting the hives.\nt = 1 to be the time in the late afternoon (around sunset) when bees stop leaving the hive.\nTherefore, in all cases below we assume d(t) = 0 for t< 0 and t> 1. The matching of the model time t to the clock time requires the estimation from data of two clock times: t0 (corresponding to t = 0) and t1 (corresponding to t = 1).\nNight dynamics. Let us start with the (easiest) night case t> 1, when bees do not depart d(t) = 0 and arrive at a constant rate a(t) = a. Assuming that at the beginning of this regime at t = 1 there are x1 bees inside, the particular solution of Eq (3) is\nx\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc 1 \u00f01 x1\u00dee a\u00f0t 1\u00de; \u00f05\u00de\nwhich corresponds to an exponential decay towards all the bees being inside the hive (x = 1) with a rate a. Therefore, we can consider 1/a proportional to the duration for which bees remain outside the hive.\nDay dynamics. Let us consider the simple case where d(t) = d and a(t) = a, both constant in time. The initial condition in this case is x = 1 at t = 0 because we assume all forager bees spent the night in the hive (i.e., 1/a\ufffd night period and all previous-day foragers return). In this case, Eq (3) leads to\nx\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc a\nd \u00fe a \u00fe d d \u00fe a e \u00f0d\u00fea\u00det: \u00f06\u00de\nExplicit solutions. We are now able to combine the results above to write explicit solu-\ntions for the fraction of foragers inside the hive x(t), the weight of food inside the hive F(t), and the total weight of the hive W(t). We consider the arrival rates during the day a1 and at dusk a2 to be different:\na\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc a1 for t \ufffd 1;\na2 for t > 1;\n(\n\u00f07\u00de\nwhere we expect to retrieve a2 > a1 (bees spend less time out when it is getting dark).\nPLOS Computational Biology | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010880 March 1, 2023 6 / 22\nIntroducing these arrival rates and a constant departure rate d in Eqs (5) and (6) we find an explicit solution divided in three time intervals for x(t):\nx\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc\n1 for t < 0;\na1 d \u00fe a1 \u00fe d d \u00fe a1 e \u00f0d\u00fea1\u00det for 0 \ufffd t \ufffd 1;\n1 \u00f01 x1\u00dee a2\u00f0t 1\u00de for t > 1\n8 > > ><\n> > >:\n\u00f08\u00de\nwhere x1 \u00bc a1 d\u00fea1 \u00fe dd\u00fea1 e \u00f0d\u00fea1\u00de is the value of x(t = 1) and ensures the continuity of x(t). We can now turn to the dynamics of food inside the hive F(t). From Eq (4) we obtain\nF\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc C \u00fe \u00f0 ~m \u2018\u00det ~m Z x\u00f0t\u00dedt;\nwhere ~m \u00bc mNmaxa and C is an integration constant to be fixed using the initial condition F(0) = F0 and F(1) = F1. The solution for F(t) is then solved by integrating Eq (8), which can be done analytically in each of the three branches leading us to\nF\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc\nF0 \u2018t for t < 0;\nF0 ~md\n\u00f0d \u00fe a1\u00de 2 \u00fe ~m 1 a1 d \u00fe a1\n\ufffd \ufffd\n\u2018\n\ufffd \ufffd\nt \u00fe ~m d\n\u00f0d \u00fe a1\u00de 2 e \u00f0d\u00fea1\u00det for 0 \ufffd t \ufffd 1;\nF1 \u00fe \u2018\u00fe ~m 1 x1 a2 \u2018t ~m 1 x1 a2 e a2\u00f0t 1\u00de for t > 1;\n8 > > > ><\n> > > >:\n\u00f09\u00de\nwhere F0\ufffd F(t = 0)\u2014for this model an arbitrary constant that is incorporated into the static weight of the hive W0 in Eq (1), consequently, without loss of generality, we take F0 = 0\u2014and F1\ufffd F(t = 1) is computed setting t = 1 in the second line of Eq (9) so that\nF1 \u00bc F0 ~md\n\u00f0d \u00fe a1\u00de 2 \u00fe ~m 1 a1 a1 \u00fe d\n\ufffd \ufffd\n\u2018\n\ufffd \ufffd\n\u00fe ~md\n\u00f0d \u00fe a1\u00de 2 e \u00f0d\u00fea1\u00de:\nFinally, the weight of the hive W(t) is obtained from Eq (1) as the sum of Eq (8) (times wNmax), Eq (9), and the constant weight of the hive W0, leading to an explicit piece-wise continuous function W(t) that will be compared to the measured data. A summary of the parameters used in the model is given in Table 1.\nEffective description of the model solution W(t). The mathematical model described\nabove is divided in three regimes\u2014t< 0, 0\ufffd t\ufffd 1, t> 1\u2014with similar characteristics as shown in Fig 3.

It can be effectively described by the 4 parameters A, \u03b1, B, and tc (see Fig 3a), which can be rewritten in terms of the parameters of the model (see Table 1) as:\nA: The total weight of the hive at W(t = 0) defined as: A = Nmaxw + W0 \u03b1: The rate of weight gain due to foraging, from Eq (9): a \u00bc ~m\u00f01 a1d\u00fea1\u00de \u2018\nB: The intersection point of weight gain at t = 0: B \u00bc \u00f0a\u00fe \u2018\u00de\u00f0 wma1 \u00fe 1 d\u00fea1 \u00de \u00fe A\ntc: The time of the minimum weight: tc \u00bc 1\u00f0d\u00fea1\u00de ln\u00f0 a dNmaxw\u00fea\u00fe\u2018 \u00de\nFig 3 shows an important mathematical property of our model: different choices of parameters lead to nearly identical curves W(t) making our model effectively underdetermined by W (t). Mathematically, this underdetermination happens because the four effective parameters introduced above (A, B, \u03b1, tc), which provide a simplified quantitative description of the solution W(t), depend on five model parameters (Nmax, W0, m, a1, d, note that ~m \ufffd mNmaxa and the mass of a bee w is taken as fixed). This means that there are different choices of the parameters \u03b8 of our model that lead to the same four effective parameters describing the second regime W(t) (even if the curves W(t) are mathematically distinct, their difference is indistinguishable in Fig 3 and much smaller than the experimental precision of the data). Biologically, this underdetermination appears due to our definition of which bees in the hive count as forager bees. Our model parameters are fixed and can be thought as an average over a spectrum of bees that ranges from very active to those that do only very few forager excursions in a day. Depending on whether we include the least active bees as foragers or not, we obtain different model parameters but the same effective parameters defined above. For instance, the same\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010880.t001\nPLOS Computational Biology | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010880 March 1, 2023 8 / 22\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010880.g003\nPLOS Computational Biology | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010880 March 1, 2023 9 / 22\ninitial weight A\ufffdW(t = 0) = Nmaxw + W0 can be obtained by including the less active bees as foragers\u2014thus increasing Nmax\u2014or as part of the non-foragers bees that spend most of the time in the hive\u2014thus contributing to the constant W0. Similarly, counting the least active bees as foragers reduces the average mass m of food brought to the hive, increases the average time they spend in the hive (i.e., decreasing d), decreases the time spent outside the hive (i.e., increase a1, a2), and leads to a larger fraction of forager bees inside the hive (x\ufffd increases). As shown in Fig 3, solutions of W(t) with very different Nmax, W0 in Fig 3b and 3d, respectively\u2014 which imply also different d, a1, a2, and m\u2014lead to essentially the same curves for the food F (t) in panel Fig 3c and weight W(t) in Fig 3a."

Effectively, this restricts the range of admissible parameters without changing the probability of parameters within the range. The estimation of the parameters \u03b8 can be done maximizing the posterior distribution P(\u03b8|D) which in our case is equivalent to the maximization of the log-likelihood (10) or to the minimisation of the squares of W0 \u2212W as\nL \u00bc Xn\ni\u00bc1\n\u00f0W 0\u00f0ti\u00de W\u00f0ti\u00de\u00de 2\n\u00f011\u00de\nin the range of admissible parameters set by the priors.\nComputation. The problem of obtaining the ten parameters introduced in our model\u2014\nsee Table 1\u2014has been thus reduced to the optimization problem of finding the minimun of L in a ten-dimensional space. The computational method we use for this optimization is centred around the Levenberg\u2013Marquardt algorithm as implemented in the library SciPy (See Materials and methods Sec-4.1). However, a reliable estimation of the parameters cannot be obtained directly through the na\u00efve application of this method both because of the high-dimensionality of the problem and the effective underdetermination of our model reported at the end of last\nPLOS Computational Biology | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010880 March 1, 2023 10 / 22\nsection (which leads to essentially flat regions of L in the parameter space with multiple local minima). Here we use properties of bee hives and our model to simplify this problem and obtain a reliable estimation of parameters.\nWe start by considering four parameters:\nw For simplicity, we fix the average weight of bees to w = 0.113 g/bee [29, 30].\nt0, t1 We infer the times t0 and t1 in a grid of plausible values (separated by five minutes). During this minimization we do not distinguish between model parameters that lead\nto the same effective parameters A, B, \u03b1, and tc because t0 and t1 are not involved in them. The estimation of t0 and t1 allow us to re-scale the data to the model time scale, facilitating the numerical estimation of the remaining parameters.\n\u2113 The continuous loss can be calculated directly from the negative linear decrease when t< 0.\nThese parameters, and the effective parameters (A, B, \u03b1, tc), are not strongly affected by the underdetermination problem discussed above. The remaining six parameters\u2014Nmax, W0, m, a1, a2, d\u2014are directly connected to the underdetermination problem and need to be estimated with care. We start by obtaining an estimation of A, B, \u03b1, and tc by direct minimization of L. The mapping of the effective parameters to the model parameters is done in two different ways:\n(i) We seek a range of plausible model parameters determined as the values of W0 and Nmax that keep the four effective parameters constant and that maintain the parameters \u2113, m, a1, a2 and d within their prior range (set in Table 1). In practice, this is done by defining different linear combinations between Nmax and W0 that are introduced in the system of six equations that connect the parameters. For each possible Nmax, we obtain a particular a1, d, and m by solving the systems of equations given by A, B and tc. The second rate of arrival, a2, is obtained by the conservation of departed and returned bees. This method leads to the estimation of an interval of possible parameters.\n(ii) Alternatively, by pre-defining one parameter, we calculate the Nmax value directly because the system of equations presents a unique solution. We focus on the departure rate d because of the consistency among different reported studies on the time interval between\ntrips that a forager bee spends inside the hive [37] and because d can be directly connected to the simplifying modeling decision of dividing bees into foragers and those that do not leave the hive (i.e., we consider as foragers the most active bees so that collectively their average departure rate is d, the other bees are considered to effectively stay inside the hive, and their weight is counted as part of W0). In practice, we choose d so that the average time spent by forager bees inside the hive between trips is \u03c4d = 0.816 h (the half-life \u03c4 is derived from the arrival or departure rate, and defined in Eq (12) below) [36].\nEven if the first approach does not lead to a point estimation of the parameters, in practice most solutions can be restricted to relatively narrow intervals by considering physically-based constraints. Some of these constraints are the average mass of food carried by a single bee m, the interval of time between trips \u03c4, and the number of trips needed to satisfy food requirements.

We used 24h time series of weights W0(t) sampled every \u03b4t = 1 minute for ten different hives on different days. The data was collected between 27th of November 2017 and 2nd of March 2019, from hives located at Macquarie Park, NSW, Australia (33\u02da 460 06.600 S 151\u02da 060 43.800 E, see [34]).

This dataset also contains an independent estimation of the total number of bees in each of the hives, obtained from measures of the total weight of the hive with and without bees (performed two days after the day we use to infer the parameters of our model) [34]. As a pre-processing step to the analysis of weight time series, we removed outliers that correspond to exogenous influences as described in Materials and Methods Sec. 4.1.\nRepresentative case. Fig 4 shows the comparison between our model with inferred\nparameters and data for one specific hive. We see how the combination of the three piece-wise continuous curves in our model (for t< 0, 0\ufffd t\ufffd 1, and t> 1, respectively) provides a reasonable account of the characteristic pattern of within-day hive weight variations. The main advantage of our methodology is the mechanistic generative model associated to this curve which ensures the parameters describing the curve have a relevant meaning. For instance, we estimate that on this day there were Nmax = 5, 830 active forager bees, that they brought on average 0.03 g of food on each trip, and that trips were on average ta1 \u00bc 0:70 h long. The difference between our model and the data is particularly pronounced at t\u2273 1, when a sharper than expected transition is observed. This suggests that modifications of our model are needed to better capture the return of the bees during the initial night period.\nActivity time. As a further test of our inference method, and the meaningfulness of its\noutcome, we look in detail at the inferred times in which foragers start (t0) and stop (t1) departing the hive on different days and different hives. The results were summarized in panels of Fig 5. The Fig 5a shows a single well-defined optimal parameter value exists, confirming the first and crucial step of our inference procedure; Fig 5b displays similar values across multiple hives in the same day and similar location, in agreement with the expectation that the initial times are similar for hives at similar locations; and in Fig 5c the estimated values for the same hive varies throughout the year, with the period of activity becoming shorter as the days become shorter (in the southern-hemisphere winter). These results confirm the success of our approach which is to treat these times as additional parameters to be inferred from the data simultaneously with the other parameters.\nSystematic analysis. Motivated by the success of our methodology in the cases above, we\napplied it systematically to 10 different hives on the same day (2018\u20134-7). The results obtained from our two inference methods are reported in Table 2. The comparison of the inferred parameters of these hives with expectations about the behaviour of bees and hives provides further evidence that our mathematical model is capturing meaningful information from the data. In particular:\n\u2022 The time forager bees start (t0) and stop (t1) departing the hives are aligned with sunlight.\n\u2022 The time of minimum weight was inferred to be around tc = 9: 45 a.m. shortly after t0 (for all hives except \u2018Hive 8\u2019, which presents a later minimum). This result is compatible with the\nminimum daily weights reported in experimental data [39], which reveal minimum weights around 9: 00 a.m. Recently, results from segmented linear regression showed minimum losses can take place even 4 hours after sunrise [40].\n\u2022 The estimation of the number of forager bees Nmax is around a few thousand bees, in line with alternative methods of estimation. In particular, Fig 6a shows that the total number of\nbees per hive correlates positively with our estimation of Nmax (R2 = 0.596, p = 0.036). The fraction of forager bees (assuming \u03c4d = 0.816h) is estimated to be around 18%, comparable to previous estimations (around 25% \u2212 30% in Refs. [41, 42]).

These estimations align with the results in Refs. [36, 37, 42]. The only hive that shows values up to 6.25 h for trip duration is Hive 8, this hive shows behaviour outside the ones predicted by our model, as evidenced by ; in the interval estimation. However, some reports points that bees are able to be outside the hive 6.25 h at the age of 36 days [35].\nArrivals and departures. Finally, we test the predictions of our model against indepen-\ndent experimental measures that tracked the number of bees that arrive and depart from a hive at a time interval [37]. Fig 6b compares these measurements to the assumption in our model and reveals the limitations of our simplifying choice of constant and piece-wise linear arrivals and departures in Eq (7). While our model captures the main characteristics of the data, unsurprisingly, bee activities do not start or end abruptly and the measured data shows smoother variations than the prediction of our model. A similar behaviour can be observed for W(t)\u2014such as in Fig 3\u2014where the measured data do not show the abrupt changes seen in the\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010880.g006\nPLOS Computational Biology | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010880 March 1, 2023 15 / 22\nmodel curve at t = 0 and t = 1 (discontinuous derivative).

Simplistic assumptions of the departure and arrival of bees allow us to obtain closed form solutions of the model that result in a continuous and piece-wise differentiable curve W(t) with 10 biologically-relevant parameters. We inferred the parameters of W(t) for 10 different hives and for different days across the year. Overall, the results reveal that the parameters we infer agree with existing knowledge of bee behavior and that the inferred number of forager bees is compatible with the expectation based on the independent measure of the total number of bees in the same hives. Further work is needed to quantitatively test the accuracy of our inferred parameters and the extent of validity of our model. For instance, future studies could simultaneously collect weight data and forager activities with tracking devices for individual bees, allowing for a direct comparison between our approach and estimations based on independent measurements.\nThe main advantage of our approach when compared to previous works is that it combines mechanistic mathematical models with data analysis to obtain interpretable quantitative information about the condition of the hive. Additional advantages of our model approach include: (i) indications from the inference of when results cannot be trusted (either because they are not capturing meaningful information or because optimal results lie outside of the allowed error range); (ii) that our framework allows for the proposal of more sophisticated models, e.g., by considering additional terms contributing to the food dynamics in Eq (4) or more detailed modes of arrival a(t) and departure d(t) such as in Eq (13); and (iii) that our model allows for a systematic exploration of the effect of foraging activities and food processing parameters on how hive weight changes over time. An important methodological expansion of our work would be to consider and compare different type of functional forms in our model. This will require considering cases in which solutions are not obtained in closed forms and the implementation of a Bayesian-model comparison that can compare models of different complexities, in line with modern simulation-based and Bayesian inference that are increasingly applied to dynamical systems of biological interest [43\u201345].\nPLOS Computational Biology | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010880 March 1, 2023 16 / 22\nThe success of our model in extracting meaningful information about bee hives opens the possibility of using it for a systematic analysis of the health of hives across different hives and across time.

In Sec. 2.2 of this manuscript this issue has been formulated as the problem of finding the parameters \u03b8 that minimize the sum of squares L in Eq (11). The ten parameters proposed in this model were reduced to nine parameters after considering the weight of a bee w as 0.113 g/bee.\nThe minimisation was performed in a nine-dimensional space through a least-square\nmethod composed of three different approximation levels. First, the clock times when bees started departing t0, and when they stopped leaving t1. Next, a reliable estimation of the characteristic features from the time series of the weight fluctuations was performed. Finally, the remaining seven parameters were obtained from the connection with the effective parameters.\nFor the estimation of clock times for t0 and t1 we created a squared-grid for the times t0 2 [6:30am,9:00am] and t1 2 [2:30pm,6:30pm] spaced every 5 minutes. These times combinations provides 1440 different scaling options. Then, we applied to each ordered pair, (t0, t1), the Levenberg\u2013Marquardt algorithm for square minimization. We used the python library SciPy (through \u201cscipy.optimize.curve_fit\u201d Pythons\u2019 function) with the inputs described in Table 3 to apply the algorithm.\nWe chose the combination of t0 and t1 that minimizes the error as the inferred scale time parameters. Then, after re-scaling our data set on the time axis, we proceeded with the estimation of effective parameters; A, B, tc, and \u03b1 from the daily-hive data. We infered the remaining seven model parameters from a system of six equations, which consist of: (i) four equations presented as the \u201ceffective description of the model\u201d; (ii) one equation from the conservation of the number of departed and returned bees; and (iii) the last equation is the rate of evaporation \u2113, which can be calculated directly from the time series after the re-scaling process when\nPLOS Computational Biology | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010880 March 1, 2023 17 / 22\nt< 0. Then, we performed a simultaneous calculation with six equations and seven variables; consequently, the system is undetermined with no unique solution due to an extra degree of freedom. We proposed that our dependent system of equations must be solved for any possible Nmax value. Note that the total weight of the hive at W(t = 0) can be decomposed in two terms only: the weight given by the total number of forager bees Nmax, and the initial constant weight W0. Consequently, our solution will depend on picking a value for Nmax and finding the corresponding W0 value. Thus, an infinite number of solutions will be obtained and then reduced to a confidence interval as can be observed in S1 Fig. Alternatively, by pre-defining one value, such as departure rate d, we can reduce the variables of our equation\u2019s system and obtain a unique solution for the parameters y\u0302.

For each daily data of 10 different hives, 200 re-samplings were generated, and the minimisation procedure described above was applied to them (for the fixed value of t0, t1 obtained in the full dataset). Suppose the inference fails or the number of iterations exceeds 5, 000 evaluation, and the optimal parameters are still not found. In that case, the re-sample is discarded (for the 10 analysed hives listed in Table 2 only 5% of the 200 re-samplings were discarded). The inferred parameters of the accepted re-samples are used to estimate the range of plausible parameters. The uncertainty reported in the main manuscript corresponds to the standard deviation over the parameters estimated in the re-sampled data. For 10 hives reported in Table 2 the uncertainty of the 7 inferred parameters corresponds to an area of 95.4% under the curve of the probability density function. The S3 Fig displays an example of the probability density to calculate the range of values for the seven parameters of \u2018Hive 6\u2019 on 2018\u20134-7.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010880.t003\nPLOS Computational Biology | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010880 March 1, 2023 18 / 22\nSupporting information"
