"The paper presents limitations and directions for further research. The DT paradigm has been adopted and its adoption is ongoing. Its implementation will progress in the coming years." 

"Despite the positive implications, there is a continued need for interdisciplinary collaboration with ICT engineers and AEC-FM practitioners to integrate IFC with the RealEstateCore ontology to build seamless relationships between data from BIM models, CoBie sensors and IoT, streamlining data exchange standards for the industry (Arsiwala, Elghaish, Zoher, 2023)."

"Further research is still required to improve data interoperability, especially with the support of, for example, the DT or CPS data protocol (Almatared et al. 2022)."

"Research suggests that AI would provide great potential to improve data acquisition and decision-making in the AEC industry. For example, AI could be used with IoT to pre-analyze raw data before sending it to DT. DT typically uses simulation to perform predictive analysis. However, AI can further improve predictive capability for better decision-making in AEC practice. In addition to data acquisition and predictive analysis, AI can also be used to support data exchange and interoperability."

"Much research is needed to successfully add a fully functional DT model to the AEC-FM industry. In addition, there seems to be a parallel effort to modernize BIM to include through the implementation of Digital Twin in the AEC-FM industry."

"The primary limitation was the availability of studies... Another limitation was the quality of available research... To collect better future research, data from practitioners and companies can be used."

"The results of such an experiment could bring closer the real-world adoption of DT in enterprises and later in national economies... Adoption of DT seems inevitable, although much more effort is needed from practitioners and researchers in this direction."
