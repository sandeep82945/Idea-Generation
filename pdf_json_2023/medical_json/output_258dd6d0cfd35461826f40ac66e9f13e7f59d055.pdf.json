We aimed to assess racial/ethnic disparity in waiting-list prognosis among patients listed for KT in the United States in the current era. Methods: We compared waiting-list and early posttransplant in-hospital mortality or primary nonfunction (PNF) among adult (age \u226518 years) white, black, Hispanic, and Asian patients listed for only KT in the United States between July 1, 2004 and March 31, 2020. Results: Of the 516,451 participants, 45.6%, 29.8%, 17.5%, and 7.1% were white, black, Hispanic, and Asian, respectively. Mortality on the 3-year waiting list (including patients who were removed for deterioration) was 23.2%, 16.6%, 16.2%, and 13.8% in white, black, Hispanic, and Asian patients, respectively. The cumulative incidence of posttransplant in-hospital death or PNF after KT was 3.3%, 2.5%, 2.4%, and 2.2% in black, white, Hispanic, and Asian patients,respectively. White candidates had the highest mortality risk on the waiting list or of becoming too sick for a transplant, while black (adjusted hazard ratio, [95% confidence interval, CI], 0.67 [0.66\u20130.68]), Hispanic (0.59 [0.58\u20130.60]), and Asian (0.54 [0.52\u20130.55]) candidates had a lower risk. Black KT recipients (odds ratio, [95% CI] 1.29 [1.21\u20131.38]) had a higher risk of PNF or death before discharge than white patients. After controlling confounders, black recipients (0.99 [0.92\u20131.07]) had a similar higher risk of posttransplant inhospital mortality or PNF as white patients than Hispanic and Asian counterparts. Conclusions: Despite having a better socioeconomic status and being allocated better kidneys, white patients had the worst prognosis during the waiting periods. Black recipients and white recipients have higher posttransplant in-hospital mortality or PNF.\nKEYWORDS\nkidney transplantation, waiting-list mortality, early posttransplant in-hospital mortality, kidney allocation system, primary nonfunction, racial/ethnic disparities\nAbbreviations aHR, adjusted hazard ratio; aOR, adjusted odds ratio; BMI, body mass index; CI, confidence interval; CPRA, calculated panel-reactive antibody; ESRD, end-stage renal disease; KAS, Kidney Allocation System; KDPI, Kidney Donor Profile Index; KT, kidney transplantation; OPTN, Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network; PNF, primary nonfunction; HLA, human leukocyte antigen.\n01 frontiersin.org"

            "text": "Kidney transplantation (KT) is the best therapeutic option for the majority of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) as it offers better quality of life and longer survival than other therapies (1, 2). Racial disparities are associated with lower socioeconomic status and longer transplant-waiting time (3, 4), which may affect the survival of patients on the waiting list and eventually contribute to worse graft and recipient survival in KT recipients (5, 6).\nPrevious studies have mainly focused on the racial disparities between whites and blacks in the long-term survival after transplantation of KT recipients; however, there is limited information on the racial disparities in the mortality rates of candidates awaiting KT. In the past 10 years, the proportion of Asian and Hispanic candidates in the United States has gradually increased, together with a decline in the proportion of white candidates (7). In the United States, the proportion of Asian and Hispanic patients on the waiting list increased from 7.5% and 17.7% in 2009 to 9.7% and 20.7% in 2019, respectively (7). However, only a few ethnoracially related KT studies have previously included Hispanic and Asian patients. Analysis of early posttransplant in-hospital mortality or primary nonfunction (PNF) may provide additional information on the prognosis of the waiting list, because sicker candidates tend to have a worse prognosis after KT. PNF, defined as failed function of the transplanted kidney, which necessitated continued maintenance dialysis (8) that occurred within 90 days post-KT, was included in the analysis.\nThe new Kidney Allocation System (KAS) implemented in 2014 increased the transplantation rates of highly sensitised individuals and reduced the known disparities in access to transplantation to some degree (9\u201311) whereas the relationship between KAS and waiting-list prognosis or early posttransplant prognosis remains unclear.\nKidney quality can be assessed using the Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI). Among kidney transplant recipients, a lower and higher KDPI are associated with longer and shorter predicted graft survival, respectively (12). Since the quality of the donated kidney can affect early posttransplant prognosis (12) we compared the differences in the changes in KDPI before and after KAS modification among races/ethnicities. The objectives of this study were to (a) compare baseline characteristics between white, black, Hispanic, and Asian patients listed for KT in the United States; (b) compare the waiting-list mortality* between these racial/ethnic groups; (c) compare early posttransplant in-hospital mortality or PNF between KT recipients across four groups; and (d) determine the role of KAS in the waiting list and early posttransplant prognoses."

Individuals\nFrontiers in Surgery 02\nlisted for multiorgan transplantation or removed on the day of enrollment (zero wait time) were excluded. The OPTN adult KT registration forms, which are completed by the transplantation centre clinicians, include details of the race/ethnicity of all recipients designated as white, black, Hispanic, or Asian. Due to their small number, patients belonging to other minorities were excluded from the study. The data reported here have been supplied by the UNOS as the contractor for OPTN. As the data was sourced from a public database, and study participants could not be identified directly or through linked identifiers, the study was exempted from ethics review.\nStudy design and definitions\nDemographic and clinical variables were recorded at the time of listing, determining the waiting-list prognosis, or at the time of transplant for ascertaining early posttransplant prognosis. Baseline characteristics and prognosis were compared between white, black, Hispanic, and Asian patients who were listed for KT during the study period. The primary endpoint (denoted as waiting-list death*) was a composite of death while on the waiting list or becoming too ill to undergo transplantation (removal from the waiting list owing to clinical deterioration). The cumulative incidence of these two events is denoted as cumulative waiting-list mortality*. Patients who underwent KT or were removed from the waiting list (for recovery or other reasons) were censored. The secondary endpoint (denoted as PNF#) was early posttransplant inhospital death or PNF in patients who underwent KT. For analysis of waiting-list prognosis, patients were followed-up from the time of listing until death, KT, removal from the list, or the day of the last observation (March 31,2021). Patients who received KT were followed-up either until discharge, in-hospital death, posttransplant failure for up to 90 days, or the last day of the study period(March 31, 2021), whichever was earlier. To assess whether the relationship between race/ethnicity and patients\u2019 prognosis was related to centre volume, we divided the listing centres into three categories according to the distribution of patients enrolled at each centre during the study period as follows: low-volume (<50th percentile), medium-volume (50th\u201390th percentile), and high-volume (>90th percentile) centres (13). None of the participants had missing data for the following variables: age, sex, race/ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), blood type, dialysis, and dates of listing, transplant, death, or removal from the waiting list. Candidates with missing data for other variables were excluded from the multivariate analysis."

Furthermore, we explored the relationship between KAS and the prognosis of candidates and recipients. This study had four major findings. First white patients with KT were older, more likely to have private insurance, and less likely to have a history of diabetes. Second, white patients were at the highest risk of dying on the waiting list or becoming too sick for KT, whereas Asian patients had the lowest risk. Third, black recipients had the highest risk of PNF#; however, after controlling for some confounding factors, black recipients had a similar risk as white recipients but with a higher risk of PNF# than their Hispanic and Asian counterparts. Finally, the implementation of KAS were associated with lower risk of waiting-list mortality* but were associated with higher risk of PNF# in white and black KT recipients.\nOur study found that despite the higher prevalence of comorbidities, barriers to private healthcare, and lower socioeconomic status, racial minorities have a survival advantage compared to white KT candidates. This finding supports previous\nFrontiers in Surgery 08\nstudies on the effects of racial differences in survival among patients undergoing dialysis (14\u201319), which showed that black or Hispanic patients survive longer than their white counterparts, indicating a survival paradox (20, 21). Our findings are consistent with the results of these studies, probably because approximately 76.3% of the candidates listed for KT in our study were also on dialysis.\nPossible explanations include the higher rates of discontinuation of dialysis therapy, which may account for the lower survival rates of white candidates. Agunbiade et al. (22) found that white patients tended to have an earlier desire to quit dialysis, which may account for their higher mortality. Our findings also indicate that advanced age is a critical risk factor for waiting-list death*, and white candidates were significantly older than candidates of other races/ethnicities (Table 1). Moreover, this survival paradox may partly be subjected to referral bias. Severely ill minority patients with ESRD may be less likely to be offered, elect to initiate dialysis (15), or be referred for KT (4) than their white counterparts. For example, in the United States, the black population accounts for 12%, but represents 36% of the ESRD population. In this analysis, however, they made up only 29% of the OPTN database (23).\nIn addition to the survival paradox that may be caused by racial differences, the obesity paradox was detected in our study: that is, obesity is a protective factor for waiting-list death*. In the general population, obesity is associated with an increased cardiovascular risk and decreased survival (24). In patients with ESRD, however, an \u2018obesity paradox\u2019 has been consistently reported (24\u201326), namely, a higher BMI is paradoxically associated with better survival (24). The relatively better nutritional status of ESRD patients with high BMI may be responsible for the reduced mortality. Notably, the improved survival associated with obesity was in the adjusted analysis, and that the covariates included diabetes, which is typically associated with obesity in adults.\nGiven that sicker patients on the KT waiting list may also have a poor perioperative prognosis, we analysed PNF# for additional insights into waiting-list prognosis. We found that black recipients had the highest risk of PNF#. However, after controlling for confounding factors, both black and white recipients had the worst early postoperative prognosis compared with their Hispanic and Asian counterparts. This finding is similar to the prognosis of candidates; that is, although white patients are significantly better off than racial minority patients in terms of medical and socioeconomic factors, the early posttransplant prognosis is still the worst. However, unlike the candidates\u2019 prognosis, the early posttransplant prognosis of black recipients was significantly worse than that of their white counterparts before adjusting for confounders. Presumably, despite the similar baseline characteristics of recipients and candidates, white patients were allocated better kidneys than black patients. For example, kidneys allocated to racial minority patients tend to have characteristics such as longer ischaemia times and higher racial mismatch rates, which are detrimental to the early posttransplant prognosis of KT recipients.\nOur study demonstrates that the implementation of KAS was associated with the number of deaths among candidates on the waiting list. Taber et al. (27) reported that KAS implementation led to significant changes in recipient demographics, increasing the proportion of African Americans, Hispanics, and those with more\nfrontiersin.org\ncomorbid conditions. Furthermore, although sensitisation status is associated with higher death (28, 29), KAS has increased the likelihood that highly sensitised recipients (CPRA 99%\u2013100%) would receive transplants (30). Therefore, the proportion of\nFrontiers in Surgery 09\npatients on the waiting list with high mortality will be reduced. The results of these studies support our findings.\nHowever, few studies have reported the relationship between KAS implementation and PNF in recipients. Our study found that KAS was\nfrontiersin.org\nassociated with increasing number of early posttransplant deaths or PNF in white and black recipients, but not in Hispanic and Asian recipients (Figure 7). However, the reasons for the different relationship between KAS and posttransplant PNF or death in recipients of different race/ethnicity require further investigation.\nThe strength of this study lies in its large sample size of 516,451 participants. In addition, the study included a diverse racial/ethnic group of patients, including whites, blacks, Hispanics, and Asians. However, this study had some limitations. First, as the database had only limited patient-level information, we could not control for unmeasured confounders, which could be residual confounding factors. For instance, the methods and drugs used to treat terminally\nTABLE 3 KDPI of kidneys allocated to patients of different races/ethnicities before and after KAS implementation.\nKDPI Before KAS After KAS p\nWhite (mean (SD)) 0.43 (0.27) 0.45 (0.26) <0.001\nBlack (mean (SD)) 0.46 (0.27) 0.45 (0.25) <0.001\nHispanic (mean (SD)) 0.42 (0.27) 0.44 (0.26) <0.001\nAsian (mean (SD)) 0.49 (0.27) 0.47 (0.27) <0.001\nKDPI, Kidney Donor Profile Index; KAS, Kidney Allocation System; SD, standard deviation.\nFrontiers in Surgery 10\nill patients on waiting lists among different races/ethnicities may vary, but data are not available. Second, we were limited in our ability to exclude candidates who were multi-registered, which may have contributed to a potential bias. However, given that this phenomenon occurs across all racial/ethnic groups, it should not have a substantial effect on the results. Third, smaller racial/ethnic groups were excluded as the number of patients was substantially small and heterogeneous to make meaningful conclusions. Fourth, the OPTN database classifies patients as white, black, Hispanic, Asian, American Indian/Alaska Native and others, however, Hispanic/Latino refers to ethnicity only. Thus the \u201cHispanic\u201d category in the current study may include patients of white race and black race, which means that any conclusions about the Hispanic category are not independent of race differences. Finally, the analysis used United States data and the background provided is United States-centric and does not encompass the broader issues of racial/ ethnic intersection in transplantation globally.\nIn conclusion, race/ethnicity was associated with the prognosis of candidates listed for KT and the early posttransplant prognosis of KT recipients. Despite having better socioeconomic status and allocated better kidneys, white patients have the worst prognosis during the waiting period. Black recipients and white recipients have higher posttransplant in-hospital mortality or PNF. KAS implementation was associated with improved waiting-list survival across all four\nfrontiersin.org\nraces/ethnicities but impaired early posttransplant prognosis for white and black recipients."
