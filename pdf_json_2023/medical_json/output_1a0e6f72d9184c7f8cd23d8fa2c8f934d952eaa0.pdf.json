    "abstractText": "The Health Effects of Cardiac Fluoroscopy and Modern Radiotherapy (photon and proton) in Pediatrics (HARMONIC) is a five-year project funded by the European Commission that aimed to improve the understanding of the long-term ionizing radiation (IR) risks for pediatric patients. In this paper, we provide a detailed overview of the rationale, design, and methods for the biological aspect of the project with objectives to provide a mechanistic understanding of the molecular pathways involved in the IR response and to identify potential predictive biomarkers of individual response involved in long-term health risks. Biological samples will be collected at three time points: before the first exposure, at the end of the exposure, and one year after the exposure. The average wholebody dose, the dose to the target organ, and the dose to some important out-of-field organs will be estimated. State-of-the-art analytical methods will be used to assess the levels of a set of known biomarkers and also explore high-resolution approaches of proteomics and miRNA transcriptomes to provide an integrated assessment. By using bioinformatics and systems biology, biological pathways and novel pathways involved in the response to IR exposure will be deciphered.",

            "text": "The use of ionizing radiation (IR) in medicine represents significant benefits for the medical care of patients. Indeed, IR remains one of the major therapeutic options for cancer treatment [1]. IR is also used for diagnostic and therapeutic imaging, particularly for pediatric patients with congenital or acquired heart disease, who may receive one or more cardiac catheterization procedures as part of their management [2\u20134]. While benefits for the patients largely outweigh the risk, the potential adverse health effects of exposure to IR are particularly important to be explored in populations of young patients who are more radiosensitive and, nowadays, survive their disease for decades [3,4]. IR is a well-known risk factor for cancer induction, and recent studies support the existence of an excess cancer risk, even at low doses of radiation [5]. Children are especially vulnerable to the oncogenic effects of IR. Moreover, the oncogenic effects of IR require a long latent period (from years to decades) that varies with the type of malignancy; therefore, an infant or child has a longer lifetime risk for developing radiation-induced cancers than an adult. Radiation-induced second malignancies are one of the most serious adverse effects following radiotherapy of primary cancers in childhood cancer [6]. Typically, radiation-induced malignancies develop in normal tissue within radiotherapy fields with a latency period of 5\u201310 years for hematologic malignancies and 10\u201360 years for solid tumors [6]. Many clinical studies reported an increased risk for second primary cancer, histopathologically different from the first tumor, in organs inside as well as outside the primary beam [6]. Interestingly, it was reported that leukemias and carcinomas are more often seen in organs receiving low-dose radiation (out-of-field dose), whereas sarcomas are more common in tissues or organ receiving high-dose radiation (in-field doses) [7]. However, the exact mechanism and dose\u2013response relationship for radiation-induced malignancy, for both in-field and out-of-field doses, are not well understood; thus, it is necessary to investigate how radiotherapy, photons, and protons impact carcinogenic risk in childhood cancer management [7]. For instance, the therapeutic use of proton beams has the potential to provide a better depth\u2013dose profile and remarkable reduction in the dose to the adjacent normal tissues compared with photon beams [7]. Additionally, there is growing evidence supporting an increased risk for late adverse non-cancer conditions [8], including cardiac and vascular effects. Thus, late adverse effects of radiotherapy have been observed on large vessels, causing cerebrovascular [9,10] and cardiovascular [11,12] diseases. Nowadays, there is also evidence for a significant elevation of cancer risk in patients with acquired as well as congenital heart diseases (CHD) in response to repeated radiological exposures [13,14]. However, more data are needed to better define the \u201cmalignant price of cardiac care\u201d [15]. The risk estimates of long-term health effects of low doses of IR (cancer and non-cancer) are still incomplete, particularly for pediatric patients. Large patient cohorts, extended follow-up, validated clinical data, and reliable dosimetry for the cohorts are needed to address this challenge. The integration of epidemiological and biological research through panels of biomarkers, together with a mechanistic understanding of the cellular responses to a particular dose and radiation quality, will provide powerful means to improve risk estimates, leading to a better quantification of the magnitude of risks associated with low-dose exposures, e.g., for out-of-field organs. The Health Effects of Cardiac Fluoroscopy and Modern Radiotherapy in Pediatrics (HARMONIC) is a five-year project funded by the European Commission to improve understanding of the long-term health risks from medical ionizing radiation exposure in children and young patients (https://harmonicproject.eu/, accessed on 4 March 2023). The HARMONIC project uses an integrated approach of conventional epidemiology complemented by non-invasive imaging and molecular epidemiology to assess cancer and non-cancer outcomes in pediatric patients treated with modern radiotherapy techniques (such as proton therapy) for cancer and X-ray-guided interventional catheterization procedures for CHD.\nThe purpose of the manuscript is to describe the bioanalytical research goals of the HARMONIC project, the rationale, and the study design, including the enrolment, endpoints, and expected results of the study. The general objective of the bioanalytical studies of the HARMONIC project is to provide a mechanistic understanding of the molecular pathways and the cellular responses that are triggered by the medical applications of IR in pediatric patients. A mechanistic understanding, together with the identification of biomarkers for individuals at increased risk to develop adverse health effects, has the potential to increase the power of epidemiological studies regarding health effects caused by IR [16\u201318]. Such biomarkers may be useful in identifying susceptible individuals who are more vulnerable to radiation damage for whom individualized treatment can be considered (by radiation sparing policy or attempts to pharmacologic or dietary radioprotection).\nThe specific aims are to:\n- identify radiation-induced biochemical responses in blood and saliva from pediatric patients exposed to medical IR; - evaluate dose\u2013response relationships for different radiation qualities and delivery techniques with regards to specific biochemical responses; - search for pre-existing biomarkers of radiation sensitivity and health effects that may be useful for molecular epidemiological studies to identify patients with a potential higher risk of radiation-induced adverse health effects."

            "text": "The HARMONIC biological study is a prospective observational study which aims to investigate the biological changes induced by ionizing radiation exposure at various time points before and after exposure. It will focus on specific molecular biomarkers reported as \u2018early signs\u2019 of biological damage and long-term health effects. These include biomarkers of oxidative stress (8-hydroxy-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine) [19\u201321], protein markers of inflammation (PTX3, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-\u03b1, NF-kB, MCP-1, etc.) [22,23], and genetic markers (telomere shortening and mtDNA copy numbers) [24\u201329]. To decipher significant intracellular pathways and novel potential biomarkers involved in response to the radiation regimes applied, four different approaches will be used: multiplexed protein profiling assays on blood plasma [30], reverse-phase protein array (RPPA) on proteins isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells [31], miRNA transcriptome on whole blood and saliva [32], and liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS) on saliva. Finally, we will develop and implement new bioinformatic models to integrate the collected biological, clinical, and dosimetry data. that may be used in epidemiological and clinical approaches to identify patients at higher risk for radiation-induced adverse health effects, not only before starting (by analyzing the sample taken before exposure), but also after finishing the exposure (by analyzing samples taken after exposure). Biomarkers will be studied in both blood and saliva to investigate whether saliva can be used as a non-invasive sample to analyze biomarkers in large-scale molecular epidemiology studies. The overall strategy of the \u201cbiology\u201d project is presented in Figure 1."

Figure 2 summarizes the protocol for the collection, preparation, and storage of biosamples.\nBriefly, a maximum of 12 mL blood will be collected at each time point in three different tubes, which are as follows:\n- one BD vacutainer\u00ae CPT\u2122 tube for the isolation of lymphocytes (~4 mL); - one vacutainer tube containing EDTA K2 (~4 mL); - one clot activator serum separation tube (~4 mL).\nThe samples will be given a unique patient identification number (pseudonymization). Within two hours post collection, tubes with blood samples will be centrifuged according to standard operating procedures (SOPs) prepared by the HARMONIC consortium to obtain lymphocytes, serum, and plasma. To investigate the possible impact of pre-analytical variables, we will record and share information on the study centers, time, and calendar days when the samples are collected. We will also record and share the time that elapses between the blood draw, centrifugation, and first freezing. Regarding saliva samples, approximately 4\u20135 mL of saliva will be collected at each time point in a sterile 10 mL plastic tube without any additive. Saliva samples will be divided into two aliquots, 2 mL in each. Aliquots of biological samples from each donor will be immediately stored at \u221280 \u25e6C (Figure 2). The type of tubes, volume, and number of each aliquots are summarized in Figure 2.

Briefly, TL will be measured in genomic DNA by determining the ratio of a telomere repeat copy number (T) to a single-copy gene (S) and copy number (T/S ratio). The relative telomere length will be calculated using the following formula \u201cT/S ratio = 2\u2212\u2206\u2206Ct\u201d, where \u2206Ct = Ct telomere \u2212 a Ct single-copy gene.

To summarize, the cells will be lysed and the protein extract will be serially diluted with a protein lysis buffer, supplemented with proteases and phosphatase inhibitors. Five serial dilutions/sample, ranging from 2000 to 125 \u00b5g/mL, and two technical replicates per dilution will be applied on the nitrocellulose microarray membrane.

The membranes will be incubated with primary antibodies that target proteins of interest or without primary antibodies as negative controls. All primary antibodies for RPPA screening have been previously tested by Western blotting to assess their specificity and selectivity to the targeted protein. RPPA readout is a fluorescent signal correlated to the protein expression level. Samples will be applied on membranes in three technical replicates (spots), and the membranes will then be individually incubated with antibodies targeting one protein of interest, followed by an incubation with a fluorescent dye. Fluorescent signals will be acquired by a microarray scanner at high resolutions and minimal autofluorescent background. The NormaCurve method will be used for data quantification and normalization [31]. This method includes a normalization for (i) background fluorescence, (ii) variations in the total amount of spotted protein; and (iii) spatial bias on the membranes. The normalized values will be employed to compare the protein expression levels across samples. Briefly, for each spot, the raw fluorescent signal of the proteins will be corrected with the fluorescent signal of the negative control (signal obtained after incubating an array, without the targeted protein antibody). This corrected signal will be divided by the total amount of spotted protein, corresponding to the normalized signal. Finally, the normalized signals of all the proteins will be scaled according to the median for further comparisons and statistical analysis. For each sample, one value will be generated for each targeted protein, and further statistical analysis will be considered."

We plan to include a target population of 100 patients from each cohort, considering the feasibility aspects of the study, the estimated level of recruitment in each participating clinical site, and a drop-out rate of 50%, aiming for a minimum of 50 participating patients in each cohort. Concerning the statistical plan, a database including clinical (diagnosis, different therapies, CT and MRI images, etc.), dosimetric, and experimental data for each patient will be created in order to perform appropriate statistical analysis. Descriptive data will be presented as frequencies with proportions for categorical variables, and either as means with corresponding SDs or medians with corresponding IQRs for continuous variables depending on the distribution. Statistical tests will include Pearson\u2019s x2 test for frequencies, the Mann\u2013Whitney U test for non-normally distributed continuous variables, and Student\u2019s t-test for normally distributed variables. Spearman\u2019s correlation test will be used to explore the association between variables and radiation doses. Exploratory analysis, including unsupervised clustering and principal component analysis, will also be performed to stratify patients according to differential protein expression or relative protein abundance. Other soft clustering, dimensionality reduction (e.g., tSNE and UMAP), or unsupervised analyses (e.g., group-based trajectory models) will be conducted to identify groups of individuals that follow similar shifts or trends on protein relative abundance or differential protein expressions over time, considering that all time points will be performed. The differential profiles will be determined based on the data analysis for baseline and each timepoint, as well as changes from baseline values (relative and absolute change). A mixed-effects model will be used to study the association between different biomarkers at different time points and the dosimetry data (dose, volume, and beam quality). Lastly, the differences in biomarker levels between a follow-up timepoint and baseline will be studied as a function of dosimetric indicators using general linear models, with adjustment for potential confounders (chemotherapy, disease history, medicines, BMI, etc.). Statistical significance for all analyses will be assessed using two-sided tests with an alpha level of 0.05 and adjustment for multiple comparisons."

            "text": "The HARMONIC project addresses a crucial question regarding the health risks for pediatric patients exposed to ionizing radiation from radiotherapy or interventional cardiology (UNSCEAR report 2008) [1\u20134]. Over the recent years, there has been considerable technological advancements that improve the therapeutic gain of radiotherapy, i.e., maximizing the dose to the tumor while sparing the healthy tissue, [7,36], as well as implementing numerous dose reduction strategies in pediatric interventional cardiology [3,37]. The difficulties associated with cancer and non-cancer risk assessments from pediatric radiation exposure could be partly overcome with precise dose estimation and biochemical studies to better understand the mechanisms that underly the development of disease processes and provide indicators of risk [16\u201318]. Radiation can induce DNA damage, especially DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which are the most lethal type of DNA damage and can result in mutations, chromosomal abnormalities, and the further development of cancer, as well as other severe health effects. However, the full spectra of biological mechanisms underlying the adverse health effects after irradiation are only partly understood. It has been reported that several biological pathways, such as DNA repair, inflammatory response, oxidative stress induction, as well as metabolic changes, are involved in response to IR exposure [17,38]. A multifactorial approach in conjunction with robust high-throughput technologies and integrated computational approaches, such as systems biology, may facilitate the discovery of new\npathways and biomarkers for the prediction of long-term adverse health effects of IR exposure [17,38,39]. Accordingly, biological research on the HARMONIC project will investigate the changes induced by medical radiation at the level of specific biomarkers which might be considered \u2018early signs\u2019 of tissue damage before the full development of adverse health effects. The project will focus on changes related to oxidative stress [19,20], inflammation [22,23], as well as nuclear and mitochondrial DNA damage [25,26], in order to identify the long-term health risks [21,24,27\u201329]. In parallel, the study will also use high-resolution approaches of proteomics and whole miRNA transcriptomes to provide an integrated assessment of bio-molecular responses to pediatric radiation exposure by identifying biological pathways that may underlie the adverse health effects of the exposures. Of note, this study has a longitudinal design which will allow the shorter-term and longer-term biological response of IR to be compared. To account for the differences between the participants, we will anchor the data of each individual on their own baseline data. This will allow us to measure the treatment effects on an individual level immediately and up to 1 year later. An additional aspect of this study is the comparison of biomarkers in saliva with those in blood samples. Especially in vulnerable populations, such as children [40,41], saliva offers an attractive non-invasive sampling method that is relatively inexpensive, safe, and easy to use. Saliva could be a valuable alternative as a biological source for human biomonitoring in occupational and environmental medicine [41], but further studies are needed to explore the robustness, reproducibility, and validity of salivary biomarkers in comparison to those analyzed in blood. As the study includes a cohort of pediatric patients that will be well characterized in terms of dosimetry to \u201cin-field\u201d and \u201cout-of-field\u201d organs [33\u201335] (https://harmonicproject.eu, accessed on 4 March 2023), it will be possible to investigate dose\u2013response relationships between biomarkers and doses to organs for both radiotherapy and interventional cardiology, as well as a comparison of effects of radiation quality. The HARMONIC databases will register the individual responses for a defined set of biomarkers and facilitate studies on the mechanisms that underly radiation-induced second/primary cancers, as well as cardiac and vascular damages. A mechanistic understanding, together with biomarkers for individuals at increased risk, has the potential to increase the power of epidemiological studies regarding the health effects of different radiotherapy modalities. Hence, we believe that a better understanding of the underlying biological and cellular mechanisms will complement the epidemiological approach of the HARMONIC project (https://harmonicproject.eu/, accessed on 4 March 2023). This will provide a unique opportunity to gain better insight into the biological effects of medical radiation doses in pediatric patients. In summary, the findings of this research project hold the potential to provide mechanistic insight in the molecular and cellular responses involved in the effects of IR of different radiation quality and doses. The HARMONIC project aims to improve the protection of patients and maximize the benefits from medical applications. The final expected output from the biological part of the project will be able to define the predictive biomarkers to be used for molecular epidemiology studies in order to identify patients at higher risk for adverse health effects.\nAuthor Contributions: Writing\u2014original draft and reading review: M.G.A.; reading review and editing: N.H., M.H.-R., J.C., A.B., F.C., J.M.S., B.F., S.B. and M.F.; conceptualization, supervision, and writing\u2014review and editing, S.H.
