    "abstractText": "The advantage that quantum systems provide for certain quantum information processing tasks over their classical counterparts can be quantified within the general framework of resource theories. Certain distance functions between quantum states have successfully been used to quantify resources like entanglement and coherence. Surprisingly, such a distance-based approach has not been adopted to study resources of quantum measurements, where other geometric quantifiers are used instead. Here, we define distance functions between sets of quantum measurements and show that they naturally induce resource monotones for convex resource theories of measurements. By focusing on a distance based on the diamond norm, we establish a hierarchy of measurement resources and derive analytical bounds on the incompatibility of any set of measurements. We show that these bounds are tight for certain projective measurements based on mutually unbiased bases and identify scenarios where different measurement resources attain the same value when quantified by our resource monotone. Our results provide a general framework to compare distance-based resources for sets of measurements and allow us to obtain limitations on Bell-type experiments.",

Certain distance functions between quantum states have successfully been used to quantify resources like entanglement and coherence.

Here, we define distance functions between sets of quantum measurements and show that they naturally induce resource monotones for convex resource theories of measurements. By focusing on a distance based on the diamond norm, we establish a hierarchy of measurement resources and derive analytical bounds on the incompatibility of any set of measurements. We show that these bounds are tight for certain projective measurements based on mutually unbiased bases and identify scenarios where different measurement resources attain the same value when quantified by our resource monotone.

            "text": "It is arguably one of the most remarkable features of quantum theory that certain quantum systems exhibit behaviors without any classical analog. While these quantum phenomena were first just regarded as a strange feature of nature which led to many philosophical questions [1\u20133], it has later been realized that these phenomena can actually be used as a resource in real-world applications such as computation [4], sensing [5], or cryptography [6]. To understand the potential of these upcoming applications, it is essential to characterize the advantages quantum technologies can provide over classical information processing technologies and which physical phenomena enable them. To achieve this advantage, properties of both quantum states and measurements are relevant. Together, quantum states and measurements give rise to purely quantum phenomena that cannot be explained by classical physics, such as entanglement [7] and its detection [8], EPRsteering [9\u201311], and Bell nonlocality [12, 13].\nThe latter two are similar in the sense that both can be seen as resources that require one out of several judiciously chosen quantum measurements to be performed on a resourceful quantum state in each round of an experiment. In particular, it is well-known that entangled states and incompatible measurements are necessary to witness steering or nonlocality [10]. Moreover, if appropriate quantifiers are chosen, the amount of incompatibility and entanglement provide upper bounds for the possible amount of steering and nonlocality [14\u201316]. Therefore, entanglement and incompatibility can be thought of as a resource for quantum advantages. In general, states and measurements may possess various other resources responsible for quantum advantages as well [17\u2013 25].\nQuantum resource theories (QRTs) [26] allow us to identify, study, and quantify quantum resources for certain quantum information processing tasks in a general framework. Moreover, this Lucas Tendick: lucas.tendick@hhu.de\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-04-22, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 1\nar X\niv :2\n20 5.\n08 54\n6v 2\n[ qu\nan t-\nph ]\n2 M\nay 2\n02 3\nallows us to identify similarities among different resources, adapt concepts and quantification methods [27\u201330] from one to another, and establish relations between different resources [14, 16, 17, 31]. Any QRT aims to answer at least the following three questions: (i) Which objects (e.g. states or measurements) are resources for a certain task, and which ones are free, i.e., do not provide any advantage? (ii) Which transformations are free, i.e., cannot create resources from free objects? (iii) How can we quantify the amount of the resource? A standard approach to quantify quantum resources, illustrated in Figure 1, asks how far away a given resource is from the set of free objects, as measured by some distance-based function.\nTogether with robustness-based [24, 32\u201336] and weight-based quantifiers [30, 37\u201341], distancebased [42\u201345] resource quantifiers form the class of so-called geometric quantifiers. One main advantage of these quantifiers is that they generally can be defined for any convex QRT [27, 29, 30, 41, 46\u2013 48] (i.e., a QRT where the set of free objects is convex), which for instance, allows for a practical way to compare certain resources with each other. The combined insights from all three classes of geometric quantifiers usually give a detailed picture of any convex QRT.\nWhile the distance-based approach has been employed successfully to resources of quantum states like entanglement [7] and coherence [18] and correlations like steering [49] and nonlocality [50], it is widely unexplored for quantum measurements, not to mention for sets of measurements. The reason for this is most likely that only recently some strategies for discrimination of single measurements on the basis of distances between them have been proposed [51, 52]. Robustnessbased and weight-based quantifiers have been used as mathematical tools to circumvent this problem. Later, it was realized that these quantifiers are also linked to operational advantages [24, 27, 30, 34, 41, 47, 48, 53\u201357]. However, the question about the existence of an operationally meaningful distance between sets of quantum measurements remained open. The interest in detailed studies on distance-based resource quantification goes beyond the question of their existence. Having access to an additional formalism for resource quantification offers new tools to study measurement resources and allows us to better understand their operational significance.\nIn this work, we answer the question of whether distance-based resource quantification for sets of measurements is possible in the affirmative. Hence, we extend the class of geometric quantifiers for convex QRTs for sets of measurements (so-called assemblages) by introducing distance-based resource quantifiers for any convex resource theory of measurement assemblages.\nFirst, we discuss the necessary properties any distance between sets of measurements has to fulfil. Then, we show that every such distance induces a resource monotone. We propose one particular quantifier, which is based on the diamond norm [58] between different measure-andprepare channels and is specially tailored to Bell-type experiments, as it captures the idea that only one particular measurement out of a given collection is applied at a time in a round-by-round protocol. Based on this quantifier, we establish a hierarchy of measurement resources, including recently introduced steering [49] and nonlocality monotones [50]. See Table 1 for an overview of the resources and the quantities we analyze in this work. We show that our quantifier can be\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-04-22, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 2\ncomputed efficiently by means of a semidefinite program (SDP) which we use to obtain analytical upper and lower bounds on the incompatibility (i.e., the non-joint measurability) [21] for any set of measurements. Finally, we show that these bounds are tight for special instances of projective measurements based on mutually unbiased bases (MUB) [59], which also play a special role in cases when different measurement resources attain the same value when quantified with our proposed quantifier."

            "text": "Consider the canonical example of the trace distance [62]. The trace distance between two quantum states \u03c1, \u03c4 \u2208 S(H), where S(H) is the set of density matrices acting on a Hilbert space H \u223c= Cd of finite dimension d, is given by\nD1(\u03c1, \u03c4) = 1 2\u2016\u03c1\u2212 \u03c4\u20161 \u2265 0, (1)\nwhere \u2016X\u20161 = Tr[ \u221a X\u2020X] is the trace norm of X. The trace distance is a useful tool to distinguish \u03c1 and \u03c4 , as it fulfils all necessary properties of a metric between quantum states. Consider \u03c1, \u03c4, \u03c7 \u2208 S(H) and any completely positive and trace preserving (CPT) map \u039b also known as quantum channel. It holds that\nD1(\u03c1, \u03c4) = 0 \u21d0\u21d2 \u03c1 = \u03c4, (2) D1(\u03c1, \u03c4) = D1(\u03c4, \u03c1), D1(\u03c1, \u03c4) \u2264 D1(\u03c1, \u03c7) + D1(\u03c7, \u03c4), D1(\u03c1, \u03c4) \u2265 D1(\u039b(\u03c1),\u039b(\u03c4)),\ni.e., D1(\u03c1, \u03c4) is a faithful and symmetric function that obeys the triangle inequality and monotonicity (i.e. it does not increase) under arbitrary CPT maps \u039b. In addition to these minimal requirements, it is well known that D1(\u03c1, \u03c4) has an operational interpretation in terms of the optimal probability to distinguish \u03c1 and \u03c4 in a single-shot experiment [62]. That is, the optimal guessing probability is given by p(\u03c1,\u03c4)1,guess = 1 2(1+D1(\u03c1, \u03c4)). These properties make the trace distance a viable tool to quantify (convex) resources.\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-04-22, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 3\nLet us consider the prime example of a resource, the entanglement of a bipartite state \u03c1 \u2208 S(H \u2297 H). One can quantify the entanglement of \u03c1 by its distance to the set Sep(H \u2297 H) of separable quantum states [42] given as\nE1(\u03c1) = min \u03c1S\u2208Sep(H\u2297H) D1(\u03c1, \u03c1S). (3)\nIt is now readily verified that E1(\u03c1) is a non-negative, convex function with E1(\u03c1) = 0 \u21d0\u21d2 \u03c1 \u2208 Sep(H\u2297H) obeying the monotonicity E1(\u03c1) \u2265 E1(\u039bLOCC(\u03c1)) under any local operations and classical communication (LOCC) [7] map \u039bLOCC. That is, E1(\u03c1) is a faithful (i.e. E1(\u03c1) = 0 \u21d0\u21d2 \u03c1 \u2208 Sep(H \u2297H)) convex resource monotone. Note that the monotonicity E1(\u03c1) \u2265 E1(\u039bLOCC(\u03c1)) captures the fact that LOCC maps cannot create entanglement. The monotonicity of resources under these so-called free operations is a crucial property of any resource theory and also reflects that these types of operations cannot create resources from free objects [26].\nWe can use the insights for distances and resources of quantum states to define distancebased resource monotones for sets of quantum measurements in the following. We describe a quantum measurement most generally by a positive operator valued measure (POVM) i.e., a finite set {Ma}a of effect operators 0 \u2264 Ma \u2264 1d, acting on a finite d-dimensional Hilbert space H such that \u2211 aMa = 1d, where 1d is the identity operator on H \u223c= Cd. Note that X \u2264 Y \u21d0\u21d2 Y \u2212 X \u2265 0 for any Hermitian operators X,Y means that the operator Y \u2212 X is positive semidefinite. A set of POVMs with outcomes a for different settings x is known as measurement assemblageM = {Ma|x}a,x. Note that we will omit in the following the set-indices and simply write M = {Ma|x} when there is no risk of confusion. If we talk about a specific element of the assemblage M, for instance the POVM corresponding to setting x, we will write Mx = {Ma|x}a. Here, we consider assemblages with m measurement settings and o outcomes in each setting, i.e. x = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,m and a = 0, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , o \u2212 1. The outcome statistics of a measurement on any state \u03c1 is given by p(a, x) = p(x)p(a|x) = p(x)Tr[Ma|x\u03c1], where p(x) is the probability to choose the setting x.\nA measurement assemblage can be converted by two different processes to another assemblage. First, as any quantum state \u03c1 can be transformed via any CPT map \u039b to another state \u039b(\u03c1), it follows from Tr[Ma|x\u039b(\u03c1)] = Tr[\u039b\u2020(Ma|x)\u03c1] that an assemblage M can be transformed via the Hilbert-Schmidt adjoint (unital) map \u039b\u2020 to another assemblage \u039b\u2020(M). Second, classical simulations (via mixtures and classical post-processing) maps M\u2032 = \u03be(M) with M \u2032b|y = \u2211 x p(x|y) \u2211 a q(b|y, x, a)Ma|x can be used to simulate [23] the assemblage M\u2032 from M via the conditional probabilities p(x|y) and q(b|y, x, a) for all y, respectively for all y, x, a. Note that as p(x) = \u2211 y q(y)p(x|y) one also obtains the allowed probabilities q(y) to perform setting y. See also [63] for an approach to simulability that combines quantum pre-processing and classical post-processing.\nWe use the probability distribution p = {p(x)} to capture the fact that typically only one quantum measurement can be performed at a time and it is also natural to assume that the likelihood of the settings x influences the capabilities ofM in experiments. Note that we consider only the case p(x) > 0 \u2200 x, as measurements that are never performed can be discarded trivially. We define a distance between sets of measurements weighted with the distribution p as follows.\nDefinition 1. Let M be a measurement assemblage containing m POVMs and let p be a probability distribution with p(x) > 0 \u2200 x = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,m.We call the tuple Mp := (M,p) a weighted measurement assemblage (WMA). Let Mp, Np, and Kp be any WMAs. Further, let \u039b\u2020 be any completely positive (CP) unital map and \u03be any classical simulation map. Any non-negative function D(Mp,Np) that fulfils the conditions\nD(Mp,Np) = 0 \u21d0\u21d2 M = N , (4) D(Mp,Np) = D(Np,Mp), D(Mp,Np) \u2264 D(Mp,Kp) + D(Kp,Np), D(Mp,Np) \u2265 D(\u039b\u2020(M)p,\u039b\u2020(N )p), D(Mp,Np) \u2265 D(\u03be(Mp)q, \u03be(Np)q).\nis a distance betweenMp and Np.\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-04-22, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 4\nNote that all conditions are in direct correspondence to the conditions in Eq. (2) for quantum states. Any distance that fulfills the conditions in Definition 1 can be used to define a faithful resource monotone for convex QRTs of measurement assemblages.\nDefinition 2. Let F be a convex and compact set of measurement assemblages, F the (maximal) set of free quantum maps \u039b\u2020 such that \u039b\u2020(F) \u2208 F for any F \u2208 F , and let S be the set of classical simulations \u03be such that \u03be(F) \u2208 F for any F \u2208 F . The tuple Q := (F ,F,S) is called a QRT of measurement assemblages.\nWe want to emphasize that all of our considerations hold for the maximal set F of free quantum maps. Therefore, they also hold for any subset of free operations. In some situations, not considering the maximal set of free operations might be physically more motivated, as it is the case for LOCC in the resource theory of entanglement.\nDefinition 3. Let Q = (F ,F,S) be a QRT of WMAsMp, Np. Any non-negative function R(Mp) that fulfils\nR(Mp) = 0 \u21d0\u21d2 M \u2208 F , (5) R(Mp) \u2265 R(\u039b\u2020(M)p), \u2200 \u039b\u2020 \u2208 F, R(Mp) \u2265 R(\u03be(Mp)q), \u2200 \u03be \u2208 S,\nis a faithful resource monotone of WMAs. Moreover, if R(Mp) fulfills\nR(\u03b7Mp + (1\u2212 \u03b7)Np) \u2264 \u03b7R(Mp) + (1\u2212 \u03b7)R(Np), (6)\nfor any \u03b7 \u2208 [0, 1] it is is a faithful convex resource monotone of WMAs. With these definitions we obtain the following lemma, showing that every (jointly-convex) distance between measurement assemblages induces a faithful (convex) resource monotone.\nLemma 1. Let Q = (F ,F,S) be any QRT of WMAs Mp and D(Mp,Fp) a (jointly convex) distance function. The distance ofM to the set F weighted with the probability p given by\nR(Mp) := min F\u2208F D(Mp,Fp), (7)\nis a faithful (convex) resource monotone. Proof. The proof relies mainly on the conditions in Definition 1. The non-negativity and faithfulness (i.e., R(Mp) = 0 \u21d0\u21d2 M \u2208 F ) follow directly, and the monotonicity conditions follow from\nR(Mp) = min F\u2208F D(Mp,Fp) \u2265 min F\u2208F D(\u039b\u2020(M)p,\u039b\u2020(F)p) \u2265 min F \u2032\u2208F D(\u039b\u2020(M)p,F \u2032p) = R(\u039b\u2020(M)p),\n(8)\nwhere we used the monotonicity of the distance and the fact that free operations \u039b\u2020 \u2208 F map free assemblages to free assemblages. An analogous calculation follows for the simulations \u03be \u2208 S. In addition, if D(Mp,Fp) is jointly convex, i.e., obeys\nD(\u03b7M(1)p + (1\u2212 \u03b7)M(2)p , \u03b7F (1)p + (1\u2212 \u03b7)F (2)p ) \u2264 \u03b7D(M(1)p ,F (1)p ) + (1\u2212 \u03b7)D(M(2)p ,F (2)p ), (9)\nfor any \u03b7 \u2208 [0, 1] and any WMAs M(1)p ,M(2)p ,F (1)p ,F (2)p it holds that R(Mp) is convex. This follows from\nR(\u03b7M(1)p + (1\u2212 \u03b7)M(2)p ) := minF\u2208F D(\u03b7M (1) p + (1\u2212 \u03b7)M(2)p ,Fp) (10)\n\u2264 D(\u03b7M(1)p + (1\u2212 \u03b7)M(2)p , \u03b7F (1)\u2217p + (1\u2212 \u03b7)F (2)\u2217p ) \u2264 \u03b7D(M(1)p ,F (1)\u2217p ) + (1\u2212 \u03b7)D(M(2)p ,F (2)\u2217p ) = \u03b7R(M(1)p ) + (1\u2212 \u03b7)R(M(2)p ),\nwhere we used that F (1)\u2217,F (2)\u2217 \u2208 F are the closest free assemblages to M(1) and M(2), respectively. Furthermore, we used that \u03b7F (1)\u2217p + (1 \u2212 \u03b7)F (2)\u2217p is free as well, by the convexity of F . Note that the arguments used here are similar to those for distance-based resource monotones of quantum states.\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-04-22, click title to verify.

More specifically, we associate to any POVM Mx = {Ma|x}a a measure-and-prepare channel defined by\n\u039bMx(\u03c1) = \u2211 a Tr[Ma|x\u03c1]|a\u3009\u3008a|, (11)\nwhere the register states |a\u3009 form an orthonormal basis {|a\u3009}0\u2264a\u2264o\u22121. Note that the channel \u039bMx can equivalently be described by its Choi\u2013Jamio\u0142kowski-matrix (see e.g. [64]). The Choi\u2013Jamio\u0142kowski-matrix of a quantum channel is obtained by applying a given channel to the first subsystem of the (unnormalized) maximally entangled state |\u03a6\u0303+\u3009 = \u2211d\u22121 i=0 |ii\u3009. More precisely, the Choi\u2013Jamio\u0142kowski-matrix of a measure-and-prepare channel as described in Eq. (11) is given by\nJ(Mx) = (\u039bMx \u2297 1)(|\u03a6\u0303+\u3009\u3008\u03a6\u0303+|) = \u2211 a |a\u3009\u3008a| \u2297MTa|x, (12)\nwhere the transpose is with respect to the computational basis. We denote the diamond distance between two quantum channels \u039b1,\u039b2 by\nD (\u039b1,\u039b2) = max \u03c1\u2208S(H\u2297H) 1 2\u2016((\u039b1 \u2212 \u039b2)\u2297 1d)\u03c1\u20161. (13)\nDue to the connection to the trace distance, the diamond distance determines the optimal singleshot probability p(\u039b1,\u039b2) ,guess = 1 2(1 + D (\u039b1,\u039b2)) to distinguish between \u039b1 and \u039b2. We want to make use of this operational relevance in the following, by designing a distance between measurement assemblages that has a similar operational interpretation. Based on the diamond distance, we propose the distance D (Mp,Np) between the WMAs defined as\nD (Mp,Np) := \u2211 x p(x) D (\u039bMx ,\u039bNx), (14)\nand its induced resource monotone\nR (Mp) := min F\u2208F \u2211 x p(x) D (\u039bMx ,\u039bFx). (15)\nNote that the diamond distance between measure-and prepare-channels has also been introduced in the context of single POVM discrimination [51, 52]. To prove that R (Mp) is a convex resource monotone, we need to show that D (Mp,Np) is distance function according to the conditions in Definition 1 and that it is a jointly-convex function.\nTheorem 1. The function D (Mp,Np) is a distance function between the WMAs Mp and Np, i.e., it fulfils all the conditions stated in Definition 1. Moreover, D (Mp,Np) is jointly-convex.\nProof. The proof relies mostly on the properties of the diamond distance. It is possible to rewrite\nD (Mp,Np) = 1 2 \u2211 x p(x) max \u03c1 \u2211 a \u2016\u03c3a|x(\u03c1)\u2212 \u03c4a|x(\u03c1)\u20161, (16)\nwhere we have introduced \u03c3a|x(\u03c1) = Tr1[(Ma|x \u2297 1)\u03c1] and \u03c4a|x(\u03c1) = Tr1[(Na|x \u2297 1)\u03c1]. Note that Tr1[\u00b7] denotes the trace with respect to the first subsystem and that we omit here and in the following the Hilbert space \u03c1 acts on. All conditions in Definition 1 and the joint-convexity can now be verified by direct computation. See Appendix A for all details.\nNote that it follows directly from its definition that R (Mp) is upper bounded by R (Mp) \u2264 1, and that it fulfills the continuity condition\n|R (Mp)\u2212 R (Np)| \u2264 D (Mp,Np), (17)\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-04-22, click title to verify.

Moreover, it can be rewritten as\nR (Mp) = min F\u2208F 2 \u2211 x p(x)p(M,F) ,guess(x)\u2212 1, (18)\nwith p(M,F) ,guess(x) = 12 (1 + D (\u039bMx ,\u039bFx)) which is up to normalization the average optimal probability to distinguish the resources M from the free measurements F in a single-shot experiment. Hence, Eq. (18) reveals the desired operational significance of R (Mp) in terms of an average single-shot distinguishability.

            "heading": "3 Hierarchy of measurement resources",
            "text": "One main goal while studying QRTs is to obtain relations between different resources. In particular, we want to understand how one resource limits another quantitatively. This will show one strength of a geometric quantifier, as it can be defined for various resource theories and the discussion often reduces to an analysis of the free sets F . In the following, we will establish a hierarchy of measurement resources based on the newly introduced quantifier R (Mp). We start by introducing the different resources.\nThe most basic resource of an assemblage is its informativeness [24]. The informativeness of a WMA quantifies how valuable it is to actually perform measurements compared to randomly guessing the outcomes in an experiment. An assemblageM is called uninformative (UI) if\nMa|x = q(a|x)1d \u2200 a, x, (19)\nwhere {q(a|x)} are some probability distributions of a conditioned on setting x. These measurements are UI as their measurement result does not depend on the quantum state. We denote the set of UI assemblages by FUI and introduce the informativeness monotone\nIF (Mp) = min F\u2208FUI \u2211 x p(x) D (\u039bMx ,\u039bFx). (20)\nNote that measurement informativeness was initially introduced only for a single POVM and studied in terms of the generalized robustness [24]. We have extended the notion here by considering the average informativeness ofMp.\nA resource that is the foundation for the distinction between classical and quantum systems is the coherence of measurements [25]. An assemblage M is incoherent (in some predefined orthonormal basis {|i\u3009}) if\nMa|x = \u2211 i \u03b1i|(a,x)|i\u3009\u3008i| \u2200 a, x, (21)\nwhere \u03b1i|(a,x) = \u3008i|Ma|x|i\u3009. These measurements cannot distinguish quantum states \u03c1 from their fully dephased versions \u2206(\u03c1) = \u2211 i|i\u3009\u3008i|\u03c1|i\u3009\u3008i|, hence they cannot detect coherence. We denote the set of incoherent assemblages by FIC and introduce the coherence monotone\nC (Mp) = min F\u2208FIC \u2211 x p(x) D (\u039bMx ,\u039bFx). (22)\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-04-22, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 7\nSimilarly to the informativeness, the coherence of measurements was initially introduced for a single POVM and we have extended it here by considering the average coherence of Mp. See also [28] for a different approach to coherence of measurement assemblages.\nThe incompatibility of measurements is probably the best-known example of a QRT for measurements and has been studied extensively in recent years [21, 35, 36, 53, 65, 66]. Contrary to classical physics, different quantum measurements may be incompatible, i.e., they cannot be performed simultaneously and one cannot access their joint measurement statistics as famously illustrated by the Heisenberg-Robertson uncertainty relation [3]. Initially interpreted as a drawback, this phenomenon lies at the heart of Bell-type experiments, as incompatibility is a necessary prerequisite to witness steering and nonlocality. An assemblageM is called compatible or jointly measurable (JM) if the statistics ofM can be simulated by a single measurement via some POVM {G\u03bb} and classical post-processing via the deterministic probability distributions {v(a|x, \u03bb)} such that\nMa|x = \u2211 \u03bb v(a|x, \u03bb)G\u03bb \u2200 a, x, (23)\nand is called incompatible otherwise. Note that using deterministic post-processings {v(a|x, \u03bb)} (which represent the vertices of the corresponding probability polytope) is not a restriction as all randomness from non-deterministic distributions can be put inside G\u03bb. We denote the set of JM assemblages by FJM and introduce the incompatibility monotone\nI (Mp) = min F\u2208FJM \u2211 x p(x) D (\u039bMx ,\u039bFx). (24)\nIt is important to note that the incompatibility in Eq. (24) is not the average of single POVM properties, as incompatibility is always a property of sets of measurements. Therefore, the incompatibility I (Mp) is qualitatively different from the coherence or informativeness.\nSimilar to entanglement, incompatibility can be witnessed in a Bell-type experiment, as both are necessary resources for steering and nonlocality. Consider the WMA Mp and any bipartite quantum state \u03c1 shared by two-parties, Alice and Bob. By performing the measurementsMp on her share of the state, Alice prepares the conditional states\n\u03c3a|x = Tr1[(Ma|x \u2297 1)\u03c1], (25)\nfor Bob. Here p(a|x) = Tr[\u03c3a|x] is the probability to obtain \u03c3a|x. We denote the obtained state assemblage by ~\u03c3 = {\u03c3a|x} and its weighted version by ~\u03c3p = (~\u03c3,p).\nTo make sure that Alice performs incompatible measurements on an entangled state, she can prove that she can demonstrate steering. A state assemblage ~\u03c3 is said to be steerable if it cannot be obtained from a local hidden-state model (LHS) given by\n\u03c3a|x = \u2211 \u03bb v(a|x, \u03bb)\u03c3\u03bb \u2200a, x, (26)\nwhere the \u03c3\u03bb are operators that satisfy \u03c3\u03bb \u2265 0 \u2200\u03bb and Tr[ \u2211 \u03bb \u03c3\u03bb] = 1. Otherwise we say ~\u03c3 is unsteerable which we denote by ~\u03c3 \u2208 LHS. Steering can also be quantified and we use the distance-based monotone introduced by Ku et al. [49] as\nS(~\u03c3p) = min ~\u03c4\u2208LHS 1 2 \u2211 a,x p(x)\u2016\u03c3a|x \u2212 \u03c4a|x\u20161. (27)\nNote that originally an additional consistency constraint \u2211 a \u03c4a|x = \u2211 a \u03c3a|x was introduced [49]. However, we do not require this constraint here, as consistency constraints are sometimes introduced for mathematical convenience which provides no advantages in our considerations. For more details on consistent quantifiers, see also [14].\nConsider now that both parties, Alice and Bob, want to prove that they perform incompatible measurements on an entangled state. LetMpA and NpB be the WMAs of Alice and Bob, respectively, and let \u03c1 be their shared quantum state. Alice and Bob obtain the probability distribution\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-04-22, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 8\nq = {q(a, b|x, y)} via q(a, b|x, y) = Tr[(Ma|x \u2297 Nb|y)\u03c1]. Note that p(x, y) = pA(x)pB(y) is the probability to choose setting x for Alice and y for Bob and we introduce the tuple qp = (q,p). To assure themselves that they share an entangled state and perform incompatible measurements, they can check whether they can demonstrate nonlocality. A probability distribution q is local if it can be obtained from a local hidden-variable model (LHV) given by\nq(a, b|x, y) = \u2211 \u03bb \u03c0(\u03bb)vA(a|x, \u03bb)vB(b|y, \u03bb) \u2200a, b, x, y, (28)\nwhere \u03c0(\u03bb) is the probability distribution of the hidden variable \u03bb and {vA(a|x, \u03bb)} and {vB(b|y, \u03bb)} are deterministic probability distributions of Alice and Bob, respectively. In this case we denote q \u2208 LHV and we say q is nonlocal otherwise. To quantify the nonlocality, we use the distance-based resource monotone for nonlocality introduced by Brito et al. [50] as\nN(qp) = 1 2 mint\u2208LHV \u2211 a,b,x,y p(x, y)|q(a, b|x, y)\u2212 t(a, b|x, y)|. (29)\nHaving introduced all these different notions of quantum resources, we can complete our goal to establish relations among them.\nTheorem 2. Let MpA , NpB be any WMAs and \u03c1 any bipartite quantum state of appropriate dimensions. Let ~\u03c3pA be a state assemblage obtained via \u03c3a|x = Tr1[(Ma|x\u22971)\u03c1] and let qp = (q,p) be a probability distribution obtained via q(a, b|x, y) = Tr[Nb|y\u03c3a|x] and p(x, y) = pA(x)pB(y). The following sequence of inequalities holds:\nIF (MpA) \u2265 C (MpA) \u2265 I (MpA) \u2265 S(~\u03c3pA) \u2265 N(qp). (30)\nProof. The inequalities IF (MpA) \u2265 C (MpA) \u2265 I (MpA) follow from the nested structure of the sets of free assemblages. More formally, FUI \u2282 FIC \u2282 FJM which can be seen by realizing that POVM effects that are proportional to the identity are also incoherent (in any basis) and as incoherent POVMs commute pairwise, they are jointly measurable [28]. Since we are minimizing the distance with respect to these sets, the inequalities hold. To prove that I (MpA) \u2265 S(~\u03c3pA) holds, we use that incompatibility is necessary for steering. This allows us to use ~\u03c4 = {\u03c4a,x = Tr1[(F \u2217a|x \u2297 1)\u03c1]} as an unsteerable assemblage for any state \u03c1, as the closest JM measurements F\u2217 (with respect to the assemblageM) cannot lead to steerable assemblages. It follows,\nS(~\u03c3pA) \u2264 1 2 \u2211 x pA(x) \u2211 a \u2016Tr1[(Ma|x \u2297 1)\u03c1]\u2212 Tr1[(F \u2217a|x \u2297 1)\u03c1]\u20161 (31)\n\u2264 12 \u2211 x pA(x) max \u03c1 \u2211 a \u2016Tr1[((Ma|x \u2212 F \u2217a|x)\u2297 1)\u03c1]\u20161\n= I (MpA),\nwhere we used the representation of I (MpA) according to Eq. (16) in the last line. We employ a similar approach to show that S(~\u03c3pA) \u2265 N(qp) in Lemma 2 in Appendix B.\nNote that hierarchies related to that in Eq. (30) have also been established, at least partly, for weight- and robustness-based resource quantifiers [14, 28]. The connection between incompatibility, steering, and nonlocality has been studied by Cavalcanti et al. [14] extensively for for weight- and robustness-based quantifiers while Designolle et al. [28] discussed the relation between coherence and incompatibility and, for a single POVM, between the informativeness and the coherence in terms of the generalized robustness.\nThe hierarchy (30) in Theorem 2 gives insights how resources like the incompatibility limit steering and nonlocal correlations quantitatively. On the other hand, every detection of these quantum correlations gives a lower bound to the measurement resources. In particular, the violation of every appropriately normalized steering or Bell inequality, in the nonlocal game formulation [67, 68], can lower bound these measurement resources. We show in Appendix C that S(~\u03c3pA) is the maximal possible steering inequality violation given by\nS(~\u03c3pA) = max Ga|x,` \u2211 a,x pA(x)Tr[\u03c3a|xGa|x]\u2212 `, (32)\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-04-22, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 9\nwhere ` = max ~\u03c4\u2208LHS \u2211 a,x pA(x)Tr[\u03c4a|xGa|x] is the classical bound obeyed by all unsteerable assemblages ~\u03c4 \u2208 LHS and the Ga|x are positive semidefinite matrices s.t. \u2016Ga|x\u2016\u221e \u2264 1, where \u2016 \u00b7 \u2016\u221e is the spectral norm.\nMoreover, the nonlocality N(qp) can be reformulated as the violation of a Bell inequality given by\nN(qp) = max Cab|xy,` \u2211 a,b,x,y p(x, y)Cab|xyq(a, b|x, y)\u2212 `, (33)\nwhere ` = max t\u2208LHV \u2211 a,b,x,y p(x, y)Cab|xyt(a, b|x, y) is the local bound obeyed by all local correlations t \u2208 LHV and Cab|xy are Bell coefficients s.t. 0 \u2264 Cab|xy \u2264 1. It is worth to highlight that the hierarchy (30) is reminiscent of the resource hierarchy for quantum states formulated by Streltsov et al. [17]. For quantum states, it holds that\nP(\u03c1) \u2265 C(\u03c1) \u2265 D(\u03c1) \u2265 E(\u03c1), (34)\nwhere P(\u03c1), C(\u03c1), D(\u03c1), and E(\u03c1) denote the quantum state\u2019s purity, coherence with respect to product bases, discord, and entanglement, respectively, using the same geometric quantifier. Comparing both hierarchies, it becomes clear that the informativeness of measurements is in some sense the analogue to a state\u2019s purity, as both quantify the deviation from their respective uninformative element. We also observe that coherence is an important resource for states as well as measurements, which allows for more complex phenomena such as entanglement and incompatibility. Incompatibility and entanglement both play a similar role in their respective hierarchies, as both are the smallest known resource that is necessary for steering and nonlocality. Interestingly, incompatibility and entanglement also share similarities in their respective resource breaking maps [69].\nMoreover, we show in Appendix D that the entanglement E1(\u03c1) as defined in Eq. (3) also upper bounds the steerability S(~\u03c3pA) \u2264 E1(\u03c1). This leads to the conclusion that the nonlocality N(qp) and the steerability S(~\u03c3pA) are upper bounded by the smallest of the used resources to obtain qp, respectively ~\u03c3pA .\nCorollary 1. Let MpA , NpB be any WMAs and \u03c1 any bipartite quantum state of appropriate dimensions. Let ~\u03c3pA be a state assemblage obtained via \u03c3a|x = Tr1[(Ma|x\u22971)\u03c1] and let qp = (q,p) be a probability distribution obtained via q(a, b|x, y) = Tr[Nb|y\u03c3a|x] and p(x, y) = pA(x)pB(y). The following inequalities hold\nN(qp) \u2264 min{E1(\u03c1), I (MpA), I (NpB )}, (35) S(~\u03c3pA) \u2264 min{E1(\u03c1), I (MpA)}. (36)\nAn example illustrating the hierarchy (30) is given by considering the respective resources of the Collins-Gisin-Linden-Massar-Popescu (CGLMP) measurements [70, 71] applied to the maximally entangled state |\u03a6+\u3009 = 1\u221a d \u2211d\u22121 i=0 |ii\u3009. In the CGLMP scenario, Alice and Bob perform two equally likely projective measurements in dimension d, given by {Ma|x = |ax\u3009\u3008ax|}, {Nb|y = |by\u3009\u3008by|}, where\n|ax\u3009 = 1\u221a d d\u22121\u2211 q=0 exp [2\u03c0i d q(a\u2212 \u03b1x)]|q\u3009, (37)\nfor Alice\u2019s measurements and\n|by\u3009 = 1\u221a d d\u22121\u2211 q=0 exp [\u22122\u03c0i d q(b\u2212 \u03b2y)]|q\u3009, (38)\nfor Bob\u2019s measurements, with \u03b1x = (x\u2212 1/2)/2, \u03b2y = y/2, and a, b = 0, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , d\u2212 1 for x, y = 1, 2.

            "text": "To study the hierarchy from Theorem 2 and the resources in more detail, an efficient method to numerically compute the respective resource quantifiers is needed. This can be done by formulating the quantifiers in terms of an SDP, which also allows us to study the quantifiers analytically by exploiting duality theory. The computation of the general quantifier R (Mp) from Eq. (15) can be stated as the following optimization problem:\nPrimal problem (general): (39) given : Mp minimize Zx,F \u2211 x p(x)\u2016Tr1[Zx]\u2016\u221e\nsubject to: Zx \u2265 J(Mx)\u2212 J(Fx), Zx \u2265 0 \u2200 x, F \u2208 F ,\nwhere the Zx are positive semidefinite matrices, J(Mx) is the Choi\u2013Jamio\u0142kowski-matrix (see Eq. (12)) associated to setting x of the assemblage M, and F are the elements of the set of free assemblages F . The formulation of the optimization in Eq. (39) mainly relies on the SDP formulation of the diamond distance due to Watrous [72].\nThis compact representation of R (Mp) can be brought into an explicit SDP formulation whenever the set F admits an SDP formulation as we show in Appendix E for the resources considered in this work. Every SDP comes with a dual formulation which under some mild conditions (Slater\u2019s condition see, e.g. [73]) returns the same optimal value as the primal problem. This condition is always satisfied for the SDP (39). Hence, R (Mp) can also be written as optimal value of the\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-04-22, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 11\noptimization problem:\nDual problem (general): (40) given : Mp maximize Ca|x,\u03c1x,F \u2211 a,x p(x)Tr[Ma|xCa|x]\u2212 maxF\u2208F \u2211 a,x p(x)Tr[Fa|xCa|x]\nsubject to: 0 \u2264 Ca|x \u2264 \u03c1x \u2200 a, x, \u03c1x \u2265 0,Tr[\u03c1x] = 1 \u2200 x,\nwhere the Ca|x, \u03c1x are positive semidefinite matrices and F are the elements of the set of free assemblages F . Note that the dual formulation in Eq. (40) is in direct correspondence to the steering and Bell inequality formulations in Eq. (32) and Eq. (33), as we maximize the difference of the resource value and the classical bound. The matrices Ca|x describe a hyperplane in the assemblage space, while the states \u03c1x fix the scale (i.e. R (Mp) \u2264 1 for any Mp) of the dual program.\nSince R (Mp) can be formulated as an SDP, it is efficiently computable (in the Hilbert space dimension d) and one can resort to standard toolboxes for its computation [74\u201377]. We want to remark that it is also possible to use a variation of the SDP (40) to obtain the optimal setting distribution p instead of fixing one in advance. This can be seen by introducing C \u2032a|x = p(x)Ca|x and adjusting the constraints accordingly. See Appendix F for an example where optimizing over p leads to an advantage over the uniform distribution for the incompatibility I (Mp), even when only two measurement settings are considered.\nEven though SDPs are mainly used for numerical optimization, the underlying structure of an SDP also offers a method to obtain analytical upper and lower bounds or even exact analytical expressions for R (Mp) depending on the complexity of the considered resource. More precisely, every feasible (but possibly sub-optimal) solution of the primal problem corresponds to an upper bound on R (Mp), while every feasible solution of the dual problem results in a lower bound. If we find feasible solutions of the primal and dual that result in the same value, we can conclude that this value is exactly R (Mp). We make use of this approach to derive bounds on the incompatibility I (Mp) for any assemblageM weighted with a uniform distribution p in Theorem 3 and to identify cases in which the hierarchy in Theorem 2 is tight in section 5.\nTheorem 3. Given any WMA Mp consisting of m POVMs in dimension d, with uniformly distributed measurement settings, i.e., p(x) = 1/m \u2200 x.

(41b)\nProof. The proof relies on finding feasible solutions of the primal (upper bound) and dual problem (lower bound) in Eq. (39) and Eq. (40) for the specific set of JM measurements FJM. For the primal, we choose\nZx = (1\u2212 \u03b7) \u2211 a |a\u3009\u3008a| \u2297 d\u2212 Tr[Ma|x] d MTa|x, (42)\nwhere \u03b7 \u2208 [0, 1] is the largest number such that F obtained from\nFa|x = \u03b7Ma|x + (1\u2212 \u03b7)Tr[Ma|x] 1\nd (43)\nis JM. The coefficient \u03b7 is known as the depolarizing robustness of the assemblage M. Now by design, F is JM and Zx \u2265 0. The remaining constraint, Zx \u2265 \u2211 a|a\u3009\u3008a| \u2297 (Ma|x \u2212 Fa|x)T , can be verified by direct computation. It follows that I (Mp) \u2264 1\u2212 \u03b7 md \u2211 x\u2016d1\u2212 \u2211 a Tr[Ma|x]Ma|x\u2016\u221e,\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-04-22, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 12\nwhere we used that p is uniformly distributed. Finally, the upper bound follows from [36], where it was found that \u03b7low = 1\nm (1+m\u2212 1\nd+ 1 ) is a lower bound to the depolarizing robustness and therefore always leads to jointly measurable measurements for general measurement assemblagesM with m measurements of dimension d. To obtain the lower bound from the dual problem, we rewrite the objective function as\u2211 a,x p(x)Tr[Ma|xCa|x]\u2212Tr[L], where L is a matrix such that L \u2265 \u2211 a,x p(x)v(a|x, \u03bb)Ca|x \u2200 \u03bb. Note that such an L always exists, which can be verified by multiplying both sides of the inequality with the POVM effect G\u03bb before summing over all \u03bb and taking the trace. We choose as feasible solution Ca|x = Ma|x\nd , \u03c1x =\n\u2211 a Ca|x = 1\nd , and L = l1 with some free parameter l. Clearly, in this\nway all constraints are satisfied for some appropriately chosen parameter l which still needs to be determined. We obtain that the incompatibility is lower bounded such that 1\nmd\n\u2211 a,x Tr[M2a|x] \u2212\ndl \u2264 I (Mp). The constraint to find l is now given by l1 \u2265 \u2211 a,x 1 md v(a|x, \u03bb)Ma|x \u2200 \u03bb, which means l is the spectral norm \u2016 1 md \u2211 a,x v(a|x, \u03bb)Ma|x\u2016\u221e maximized over the deterministic distributions {v(a|x, \u03bb)}. This means to find a valid l, we need to find an l such that\nl \u2265 T md , (44)\nwhere T := \u2016 \u2211 a,x v\n\u2217(a|x, \u03bb)Ma|x\u2016\u221e and {v\u2217(a|x, \u03bb)}a,x are the deterministic probability distributions that maximize the right-hand side of Eq (44), respectively the spectral norm in the definition of T .\nUsing the results in [78] it follows that l = 1 md (max a,x \u2016Ma|x\u2016\u221e+(m\u22121) max x,x\u2032 6=x,a,a\u2032 \u2016M1/2a|xM 1/2 a\u2032|x\u2032\u2016\u221e)\nis a valid choice, from which the lower bound on I (Mp) follows.\nWhile the bounds in Theorem 3 look complicated, we highlight that they become much simpler in the case of rank-1 projective measurements and especially for measurements based on MUB. Two orthonormal bases {|va\u3009}0\u2264a\u2264d\u22121 and {|wb\u3009}0\u2264b\u2264d\u22121 are MUB if\n|\u3008va|wb\u3009| = 1\u221a d \u2200 a, b. (45)\nThe set of projectors onto the vectors of a basis form a measurementM = {Ma = |va\u3009\u3008va|}. An MUB measurement assemblage is a set of measurements where the condition (45) holds for any two projections from different bases. MUB measurement assemblages find many applications in quantum information [59] and are natural candidates for highly incompatible measurements as studied in [36, 66, 79]. It is known that in every dimension d \u2265 2 there exist at least m = pr + 1 MUB, where pr is the smallest prime power factor of d [80]. While it is in general an open problem how many MUB really exist in a given dimension d, explicit constructions for m = d+ 1 MUB are known when d is a prime-power.\nRegarding the simplifications for rank-1 projective measurements we observe from the proof of Theorem 3 that it holds\n1 md \u2211 a,x Tr[M2a|x]\u2212 T m \u2264 I (Mp) \u2264 1\u2212 \u03b7 md \u2211 x \u2016d1\u2212 \u2211 a Tr[Ma|x]Ma|x\u2016\u221e, (46)\nwhere T := \u2016 \u2211 a,x v \u2217(a|x, \u03bb)Ma|x\u2016\u221e and \u03b7 \u2208 [0, 1] is the largest number such that the assemblage F containing the measurements Fa|x = \u03b7Ma|x + (1 \u2212 \u03b7)Tr[Ma|x] 1\nd is JM. Due to the fact that\nTr[Ma|x] = Tr[M2a|x] = 1 for rank-1 projections, we obtain the following corollary.\nCorollary 2. The incompatibility I (Mp) of any measurement assemblage M consisting of m rank-1 projective measurements, weighted with a uniformly distributed p(x) = 1\nm \u2200 x, is bounded\nas\n1\u2212 T m \u2264 I (Mp) \u2264 (1\u2212 \u03b7) d\u2212 1 d , (47)\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-04-22, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 13\nwith T := \u2016 \u2211 a,x v\n\u2217(a|x, \u03bb)Ma|x\u2016\u221e and the depolarizing robustness \u03b7 defined via Eq. (43). Using the overlap relation in Eq. (45) and the same lower bound on \u03b7 as in Theorem 3, it follows\nfor a uniformly weighted MUB measurement assemblage that\n1\u2212 1 m\n( 1 + (m\u2212 1)\u221a\nd\n) \u2264 I (Mp) \u2264\n(d\u2212 1)(m\u2212 1) (d+ 1)m . (48)\nSome asymptotic behaviours for the incompatibility of MUB measurement assemblages can be observed. In the case of large dimensions d for a fixed number of measurements, the incompatibility approaches I (Mp) \u2248 1 \u2212 1 m\n(as the upper and lower bound collapse onto each other) i.e. it asymptotically approaches the value 1 for large d and m. To get an impression of the quality of the bounds in Eq. (48) we investigate a specific construction of MUB in prime dimensions d based on the Heisenberg-Weyl operators\nX\u0302 = d\u22121\u2211 k=0 |k + 1\u3009\u3008k|, Z\u0302 = d\u22121\u2211 k=0 \u03c9k|k\u3009\u3008k|, (49)\nwhere {|k\u3009}0\u2264k\u2264d\u22121 is the computational basis and \u03c9 = exp (2\u03c0i d ) is a root of unity. In prime dimensions d, the eigenbases of the d+ 1 operators X\u0302, Z\u0302, X\u0302Z\u0302, X\u0302Z\u03022, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , X\u0302Z\u0302d\u22121 are mutually unbiased [81]. We use these eigenbases to form sets of projective POVMs. Note that it matters which subset of eigenbases we choose. For example, the set of measurements associated with the eigenbases ofM(1) = {X\u0302, Z\u0302, X\u0302Z\u0302} can possibly have a different incompatibility than the measurements associated with the setM(2) = {X\u0302Z\u0302d\u22123, X\u0302Z\u0302d\u22122, X\u0302Z\u0302d\u22121}. This is indeed the case for MUB measurement assemblages in dimension d = 5 andm = 3 settings. We find that I (M(1)p ) = 0.3750, while I (M(2)p ) = 0.3685. This shows that different MUB are operationally inequivalent, which has also been demonstrated for the depolarizing robustness [66]. For the values in Table 2, we used the assignment of MUB according to the WMAM(1)p , i.e., we take the first m eigenbases. As one can see in Table 2, the upper and lower bounds combined give a good idea on how incompatible this implementation of MUB is in practical scenarios. The lower bound can be tightened significantly by using the bound from Corollary 2 directly. Note that this requires an optimization over all Ndet = om deterministic assignments {v(a|x, \u03bb)}, where o is the number of measurement outcomes for each of the m settings. Surprisingly, the tightened lower bound coincides with the numerical values for the incompatibility I (Mp) for all m, d in Table 2 up to the fourth digit. While we were not able to show that the lower bound from Corollary 2 is tight for MUB measurement assemblages in general, we are able to identify important cases where this is indeed the case.\nMore specifically, it was shown by Designolle et al. [66] that \u03b7 = dT \u2212m dm\u2212m\nis the depolarising robustness for the standard construction of MUB measurement assemblages in prime power dimensions given in [82] for m = 2, m = d, and m = d+ 1 measurements. It is important to highlight that the construction used above, based on the Heisenberg-Weyl operators, is an equivalent reformulation of this construction for prime dimensions [81]. From Eq. (47), it follows directly that I (Mp) = 1\u2212 T\nm , since the upper and lower bound coincide for these cases. Note that while this\nresult holds only for this special construction, it was conjectured [66] that \u03b7 = dT \u2212m dm\u2212m\nholds for all constructions of MUB and m = 2, m = d, and m = d + 1. Note further that the bounds in Eq. (48) can also be used to study cases where it is not known whether MUB exist. For instance, if there exists a set of m = 4 MUB in d = 6, the WMA needs to have an incompatibility in between 0.4438 \u2264 I (Mp) \u2264 0.5357.\nTo conclude this section, we want to emphasize that analogous discussions to obtain bounds on the resource quantifier R (Mp) can be made for any QRT with a free set F that can be described by SDP constraints. For instance, we show in Appendix G that the informativeness IF (Mp) of rank-1 projective measurements is given by IF (Mp) = 1 \u2212\n1 d for any probability distribution p.\nNote that since the set FUI of UI assemblages (see Eq. (19)) has a much simpler structure than the set of JM measurements, it is also easier to obtain exact expressions.\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-04-22, click title to verify.

            "text": "It is particularly interesting to study the optimal conversion of one resource to another, i.e., to study for which measurements (and states) the bounds in Eq. (30) are tight. Obviously, for UI measurements it holds IF (Mp) = 0 and all bounds are trivially tight. We study nontrivial cases of resource equivalences where IF (Mp) = C (Mp) and I (Mp) = S(~\u03c3p) holds. We start with the latter.\nIncompatibility and steerability are known to be deeply connected and equivalences have been reported for robustness and weight-based quantifiers [14, 31]. We consider again the situation of uniformly distributed measurements, i.e., p(x) = 1/m. Let \u03c1 = |\u03a6+\u3009\u3008\u03a6+| be the maximally entangled state, where |\u03a6+\u3009 = 1\u221a\nd\n\u2211d\u22121 i=0 |ii\u3009. It is readily verified that\n\u03c3a|x = Tr1[(Ma|x \u2297 1)\u03c1] = MTa|x\nd , (50)\nwhere the transposition is with respect to the computational basis. Using the state assemblage ~\u03c3 = {\u03c3a|x} obtained via Eq. (50) is the standard approach to map incompatibility problems to steering problems and proves also to be useful here. In section 4, we showed that for the construction of MUB in [82] and m = 2, m = d, m = d + 1 measurements I (Mp) = 1 \u2212 T\nm holds, where T = \u2016 \u2211 a,x v \u2217(a|x, \u03bb)Ma|x\u2016\u221e. It follows that 1 \u2212 T\nm \u2265 S(~\u03c3p). Using the state assemblage ~\u03c3\nobtained from Eq. (50), it is possible to show that this bound is indeed fulfilled. To show this, we employ the steering inequality formulation of S(~\u03c3p) as discussed in Eq. (32), which we repeat here for convenience:\nS(~\u03c3p) = max Ga,x,` \u2211 a,x p(x)Tr[\u03c3a|xGa|x]\u2212 `, (51)\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-04-22, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 15\nwhere ` = max ~\u03c4\u2208LHS \u2211 a,x p(x)Tr[\u03c4a|xGa|x] is the classical bound obeyed by all unsteerable assemblages ~\u03c4 \u2208 LHS and the Ga|x are positive semidefinite matrices such that \u2016Ga|x\u2016\u221e \u2264 1. We want to emphasize that ` can equivalently be defined in a way that it has to satisfy `1 \u2265 \u2211 a,x p(x)v(a|x, \u03bb)Ga|x for all \u03bb. By multiplying both sides of the inequalities with the hidden states \u03c3\u03bb and taking the trace trace afterwards it follows ` \u2265 max\n~\u03c4\u2208LHS \u2211 a,x p(x)Tr[\u03c4a|xGa|x] and the equality follows from the\nfact that we maximize over `. Now, by choosing Ga|x = MTa|x and ` = T\nm , clearly all constraints\nare fulfilled and the steerability is lower bounded by S(~\u03c3p) \u2265 1 \u2212 T\nm , which coincides with the\nupper bound. Therefore, it follows that I (Mp) = S(~\u03c3p). While this result is only valid for m = 2, m = d, and m = d+ 1 and the special construction of MUB in [82] we conjecture that the equivalence between incompatibility and steerability holds for general constructions of MUB and 2 \u2264 m \u2264 d+ 1.\nWe searched numerically for other cases with an equality between incompatibility and steerability. However, apart from the case of generic qubit projective measurements we were not able to identify any other scenarios. Note that this finding deviates from the observations for consistent weight and robustness quantifiers studied by Cavalcanti et al. [14], where an equivalence between incompatibility and steerability was found for all assemblages. This difference is not artificial, as it remains even if we include the consistency constraint for the steerability below Eq. (27).\nThe second equivalence of resources we want to discuss is that between the informativeness and the coherence of assemblages. More precisely, we discuss when IF (Mp) = C (Mp) holds. Interestingly, this equivalence is achieved by WMAs Mp that are mutually unbiased to the set of projective measurements onto the incoherent basis {|i\u3009\u3008i|}. To see this, we note first that IF (Mp) = 1\u2212\n1 d holds for all rank-1 projective measurements as shown in section 4. From there\nit follows that the coherence of MUB is bounded by 1 \u2212 1 d \u2265 C (Mp). To show that this bound can be achieved, we use the dual formulation of C (Mp). More specifically, C (Mp) is given by\nC (Mp) = max Ca|x,`x,i \u2211 a,x p(x)Tr[Ma|xCa|x]\u2212 \u2211 x,i `x,i, (52)\nwhere the `x,i are scalars such that `x,i \u2265 p(x)Tr[Ca|x|i\u3009\u3008i|] \u2200 a, x, i, and the Ca|x are matrices such that 0 \u2264 Ca|x \u2264 \u03c1x \u2200 a, x, where the \u03c1x are quantum states. The optimal solutions of the dual problem are Ca|x = Ma|x\nd and `x,i = p(x) d2 . Clearly, these choices are feasible, which can be\nverified by using that Tr[|i\u3009\u3008i|Ma|x] = 1 d , due to the unbiasedness ofM and the incoherent basis {|i\u3009\u3008i|}. Further, they are optimal since they lead to C (Mp) \u2265 1 \u2212 1 d , which coincides with the upper bound. The fact that measurements that are mutually unbiased to the incoherent basis maximize the coherence is very similar to the situation for quantum states [17]. There, for a fixed spectrum, the coherence is maximized by states that have an eigendecomposition in a mutually unbiased basis with respect to the incoherent basis. Note that the measurements within M do not need to be MUB measurement assemblages themselves, as long as they are mutually unbiased to the incoherent bases. Indeed, we show in Appendix G that the CGLMP measurements defined via Eq. (37) and Eq. (38) also maximize the coherence in the sense that IF (Mp) = C (Mp) = 1\u2212 1 d . Note that it is known that the maximal coherence of a single POVM in terms of the generalized robustness can be achieved by measurements in the Fourier basis of the incoherent basis [47] .\nLet us briefly comment on the other two inequalities of the hierarchy in Eq. (30). The remaining two inequalities are C (Mp) \u2265 I (Mp) and S(~\u03c3pA) \u2265 N(qp). While the relation between steering and nonlocality is notoriously hard to study, even for two-qubit states, the connection between coherence and incompatibility has only recently gained some attention [28, 83]. Our numerical search suggests that both bounds are true inequalities in non-trivial scenarios. However, future research is needed to come to a conclusion.\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-04-22, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 16"

            "text": "Quantifying quantum advantages plays an important role in modern quantum information theory, particularly in the framework of QRTs. The quantification of measurement resources has developed historically in a different direction than the quantification of state resources, as it was unclear how a distance-based approach can be applied to measurements and especially sets of measurements in a meaningful way. Instead, weight-based and especially robustness-based quantifiers were predominantly used for quantifying measurement resources so far.\nIn the present work, we have solved this problem by introducing the general notion of distancebased resource quantification for sets of measurements. We have studied which prerequisites are necessary for a function to be a proper distance between measurement assemblages and showed that every such distance induces a resource monotone for any convex QRT. We have proposed one particular quantifier, based on the diamond norm, with a clear operational meaning in terms of the optimal single-shot distinguishability of different measurement assemblages.\nOn the basis of this particular quantifier, we have established a hierarchy of measurement resources in Theorem 2 and showed that recently introduced steering [49] and nonlocality quantifiers [50] fit naturally into this hierarchy. Furthermore, we have shown that our quantifier can be studied numerically and analytically in terms of SDPs. We have used this insight to establish analytical upper and lower bounds on the incompatibility of any measurement assemblage in Theorem 3. Noteworthy, by focussing on rank-1 projective measurements, we have shown that the bounds on the incompatibility in Corollary 2 are tight for particular MUB measurement assemblages, which play a special role in the established measurement hierarchy. More precisely, we showed in section 5 that the incompatibility of MUB measurement assemblages attains the same value as the steerability of the state assemblages obtained from performing these measurements on one part of a maximally entangled state. Furthermore, we showed that measurements that are mutually unbiased to the incoherent basis maximize the coherence among all rank-1 projective measurements.\nIt would be interesting to see which insights can be obtained when distance-based quantifiers like the one presented here are studied for other resource theories like projective-simulability [22] or the QRT of imaginarity [20] applied to measurements. Furthermore, distance-based quantifiers should also be compared to possible entropic resource quantifiers of measurement assemblages. So far, entropic quantifiers have only been considered very recently [84] for a single POVM. With the definition of a distance between measurement assemblages, it is also possible to study the continuity of functions of measurement resources, which could be of independent interest for robust self-testing [85] or measurement tomography [86]."

Moreover, D (Mp,Np) is jointly-convex. Proof. We start by writing D (Mp,Np) in a more convenient form. More precisely, we use in the following that the triangle inequality for the trace norm \u2016\u00b7\u20161 results in an equality due to the support on different subspaces of the terms with different a within the sum over the outcomes a. Furthermore, we used the multiplicity of the trace norm under tensor products and the fact that \u2016|a\u3009\u3008a|\u20161 = 1 \u2200 a.

(54) in the following. Clearly D (Mp,Np) is a non-negative function with D (Mp,Np) = 0 if and only ifM = N . The triangle inequality is obeyed due to the linearity of D (Mp,Np) in the trace norm.

The resulting state (\u039b\u22971)(\u03c1\u2032) is clearly already included in the optimization of the first line, hence the inequality. In the third line, we used the fact that we can swap the evolution under the CPT map \u039b onto the POVMs by introducing the adjoint channel \u039b\u2020. This results exactly in the definition of D (\u039b\u2020(M)p,\u039b\u2020(N )p), from which the monotonicity under quantum channel \u039b\u2020 follows.\nThe monotonicity under classical simulations \u03be can be shown in a similar fashion, D(\u03be(Mp)q, \u03be(Np)q) = 1 2 \u2211 y q(y) max \u03c1 \u2211 b \u2016Tr1[((M \u2032b|y \u2212N \u2032b|y)\u2297 1)\u03c1]\u20161 (56)\n= 12 \u2211 y q(y) max \u03c1 \u2211 b \u2016 \u2211 x p(x|y) \u2211 a q(b|y, x, a)Tr1[((Ma|x \u2212Na|x)\u2297 1)\u03c1]\u20161\n\u2264 12 \u2211 y q(y) max \u03c1 \u2211 b \u2211 x p(x|y) \u2211 a q(b|y, x, a)\u2016Tr1[((Ma|x \u2212Na|x)\u2297 1)\u03c1]\u20161\n= 12 \u2211 y q(y) max \u03c1 \u2211 x p(x|y) \u2211 a \u2016Tr1[((Ma|x \u2212Na|x)\u2297 1)\u03c1]\u20161\n\u2264 12 \u2211 x,y q(y)p(x|y) max \u03c1 \u2211 a \u2016Tr1[((Ma|x \u2212Na|x)\u2297 1)\u03c1]\u20161\n= 12 \u2211 x p(x) max \u03c1 \u2211 a \u2016Tr1[((Ma|x \u2212Na|x)\u2297 1)\u03c1]\u20161\n= D (Mp,Np),\nwhere we used the following properties.

In the third line, we used the triangle inequality. In the fourth line, we performed the sum over b. In the fifth line, we interchanged the maximization with the sum over x, which leads to more degrees of freedom since we can now choose a different \u03c1 for each x. Finally, in the sixth line, we used that \u2211 y q(y)p(x|y) = p(x), which leads exactly to the definition of D (Mp,Np) from which the monotonicity under classical simulations \u03be(Mp)q follows. The joint-convexity of D (Mp,Np) can be seen by first considering the joint-convexity of the diamond distance D (\u039bMx ,\u039bNx) between measure and prepare channels \u039bMx and \u039bNx . The joint-convexity of a norm induced distance follows from the triangle inequality and the absolute homogeneity of the norm, which implies its convexity. It now follows that\nD (\u03b7M(1)p + (1\u2212 \u03b7)M(2)p , \u03b7F (1)p + (1\u2212 \u03b7)F (2)p ) (57) = \u2211 x p(x) D (\u03b7\u039bM(1)x + (1\u2212 \u03b7)\u039bM(2)x , \u03b7\u039bF(1)x + (1\u2212 \u03b7)\u039bF(2)x )\n\u2264 \u2211 x p(x)[\u03b7D (\u039bM(1)x ,\u039bF(1)x ) + (1\u2212 \u03b7) D (\u039bM(2)x ,\u039bF(2)x )] = \u03b7D(M(1)p ,F (1)p ) + (1\u2212 \u03b7)D(M(2)p ,F (2)p ),\nwhich concludes the proof."

            "text": "Here, we show that the steerability S(~\u03c3pA) and the nonlocality N(qp) can be understood as optimal steering, respectively Bell inequality violation.\nTheorem 4. Let S(~\u03c3pA) be the steerability of the state assemblage ~\u03c3pA . The steerability S(~\u03c3pA) can be reformulated as the violation of an optimized steering inequality given by\nS(~\u03c3pA) = max Ga,x,` \u2211 a,x pA(x)Tr[\u03c3a|xGa|x]\u2212 `, (60)\nwhere ` = max ~\u03c4\u2208LHS \u2211 a,x pA(x)Tr[\u03c4a|xGa|x] is the classical bound obeyed by all unsteerable assemblages ~\u03c4 \u2208 LHS and the Ga|x are positive semidefinite matrices s.t. \u2016Ga|x\u2016\u221e \u2264 1. Moreover, the nonlocality N(qp) of any probability distribution qp can be reformulated as the violation of an optimized Bell inequality\nN(qp) = max Cab|xy,`\u2032 \u2211 a,b,x,y p(x, y)Cab|xyq(a, b|x, y)\u2212 `\u2032, (61)\nwhere `\u2032 = max t\u2208LHV \u2211 a,b,x,y p(x, y)Cab|xyt(a, b|x, y) is the local bound obeyed by all local correlations t \u2208 LHV and Cab|xy are Bell coefficients s.t. 0 \u2264 Cab|xy \u2264 1.\nProof. The proof relies on the dual formulations of S(~\u03c3pA), which can be written in terms of an SDP, and N(qp) which can be written as a linear program. We start with the nonlocality N(qp) by stating the optimization for an optimal Bell inequality violation given the distribution q and by showing that it is dual to N(qp). Note that all of the following optimization problems require the knowledge of the deterministic probability distributions of the corresponding problem, which for the nonlocality N(qp) are denoted by {vA(a|x, \u03bb)vB(b|y, \u03bb)}. Since these are fixed for a given problem and are trivially accessible, we will not treat them as input variables.\nDual problem (nonlocality): (62) given : qp maximize Cab|xy,`\u2032 \u2211 a,b,x,y p(x, y)Cab|xyq(a, b|x, y)\u2212 `\u2032\nsubject to: `\u2032 \u2265 \u2211 a,b,x,y p(x, y)Cab|xyvA(a|x, \u03bb)vB(b|y, \u03bb) \u2200 \u03bb,\n0 \u2264 Cab|xy \u2264 1 \u2200 a, b, x, y,\nwhere Cab|xy are the Bell coefficients of the Bell inequality and `\u2032 is the local bound. Note that `\u2032 = max t\u2208LHV \u2211 a,b,x,y p(x, y)Cab|xyt(a, b|x, y) follows directly from the first constraint. Remember that t admits an LHV decomposition according to Eq. (28). The equality can be seen by multiplying the constraints `\u2032 \u2265 \u2211 a,b,x,y p(x, y)Cab|xyvA(a|x, \u03bb)vB(b|y, \u03bb) \u2200 \u03bb with the probabilities \u03c0(\u03bb) before summing all the constraints together. This leads to the bound `\u2032 \u2265 max t\u2208LHV \u2211 a,b,x,y p(x, y)Cab|xyt(a, b|x, y),\nwith t(a, b|x, y) = \u2211 \u03bb \u03c0(\u03bb)vA(a|x, \u03bb)vB(b|y, \u03bb). The equality follows from the fact that we maximize the objective function. Now, we show that the optimal value of the optimization in Eq. (62) is equal to N(qp) by deriving the primal program. Note that this generally requires dealing with inequality constraints, which can be done by generalizing the method of Lagrange multipliers to using the Karush\u2013Kuhn\u2013Tucker conditions (see e.g. [73]). However, since we are interested in formulating dual formulations of convex optimization problems, we can rely on simpler but less general conditions for the equivalence of the primal and the dual problem, which we come back to down below. We start by stating the\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-04-22, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 20\nLagrangian of the problem: L = \u2211 a,b,x,y p(x, y)Cab|xyq(a, b|x, y)\u2212 `\u2032 (63)\n+ \u2211 \u03bb \u03c0(\u03bb) ( `\u2032 \u2212 \u2211 a,b,x,y p(x, y)Cab|xyvA(a|x, \u03bb)vB(b|y, \u03bb) )\n+ \u2211 a,b,x,y Aab|xy(1\u2212 Cab|xy) + \u2211 a,b,x,y Bab|xyCab|xy,\nwhere we introduced the Lagrange parameters \u03c0(\u03bb), Aab|xy, and Bab|xy to make the constraints explicit. Note that \u2211 a,b,x,y p(x, y)Cab|xyq(a, b|x, y)\u2212`\u2032 \u2264 L for any feasible {Cab|xy}, `\u2032 in Eq. (62), as long as all the \u03c0(\u03bb), Aab|xy, and Bab|xy are non-negative coefficients. We obtain the dual function (which is here actually the dual function of the dual problem) by taking the supremum of the Lagrangian over the given (here the dual) variables. More precisely, the dual function is given by\nG({\u03c0(\u03bb)}, {Aab|xy}, {Bab|xy}) = sup Cab|xy,`\u2032\n{ `\u2032(\u22121 + \u2211 \u03bb \u03c0(\u03bb)) + \u2211 a,b,x,y Aab|xy (64)\n+ \u2211 a,b,x,y Cab|xy ( p(x, y)q(a, b|x, y)\u2212 p(x, y) \u2211 \u03bb \u03c0(\u03bb)vA(a|x, \u03bb)vB(b|y, \u03bb)\u2212Aab|xy +Bab|xy )} .\nThe dual function is unbounded from above, unless certain constraints (the primal constraints) are met. This can for instance be seen by realizing that unless (\u22121+ \u2211 \u03bb \u03c0(\u03bb)) = 0, it is always possible\nto make the term `\u2032(\u22121 + \u2211 \u03bb \u03c0(\u03bb)) arbitrarily large, since `\u2032 is now treated as an unconstrained variable. We obtain the primal program by minimizing the dual function under these constraints. The primal program is given by\nPrimal problem (nonlocality): (65) given : qp\nminimize Aab|xy,Bab|xy,\u03c0(\u03bb) \u2211 a,b,x,y Aab|xy\nsubject to: Aab|xy \u2212Bab|xy = p(x, y) ( q(a, b|x, y)\u2212 \u2211 \u03bb \u03c0(\u03bb)vA(a|x, \u03bb)vB(b|y, \u03bb) ) ,\u2211\n\u03bb\n\u03c0(\u03bb) = 1, \u03c0(\u03bb) \u2265 0 \u2200 \u03bb, Aab|xy, Bab|xy \u2265 0 \u2200 a, b, x, y.\nNow, by definition of the `1-distance between two normalized probability distributions, the optimal value of Eq. (65) is exactly N(qp) (see, for instance, Remark 4.3 in [87]). Since we are dealing with a linear program, there is no duality gap between the primal and the dual formulation. Hence, N(qp) describes the maximal Bell violation possible with the probability distribution qp.\nNext, we need to show that S(~\u03c3pA) corresponds to the optimal steering inequality violation. The procedure is the same as before for the nonlocality. However, this time we start from the primal problem.\nPrimal problem (steerability): (66) given : ~\u03c3pA\nminimize \u03c3\u03bb 1 2 \u2211 a,x pA(x)\u2016\u03c3a|x \u2212 \u2211 \u03bb v(a|x, \u03bb)\u03c3\u03bb\u20161\nsubject to: Tr[ \u2211 \u03bb \u03c3\u03bb] = 1, \u03c3\u03bb \u2265 0 \u2200 \u03bb.\nFirst, we need to rewrite the trace norm explicitly in SDP form.

The optimization variables of the primal problem are the positive coefficients ax, and the positive semidefinite matrices Zx and G\u03bb. The optimization variables of the dual problem are the positive semidefinite matrices Ca|x, \u03c1x, and L.\nThe formulation of the primal problem heavily relies on the SDP formulation of the diamond norm due to Watrous [72], see also [89]. Let us recall that the Choi\u2013Jamio\u0142kowski-matrix of a measure-and-prepare channel (see Eq. (12)) corresponding to one POVMMx = {Ma|x}a is given by\nJ(Mx) = \u2211 a |a\u3009\u3008a| \u2297MTa|x, (78)\nwhere the transpose is with respect to the computational basis. The diamond distance between the quantum channels \u039bMx and \u039bFx can now be computed as\ngiven : J(Mx), J(Fx) (79) minimize\nZx \u2016Tr1[Zx]\u2016\u221e\nsubject to: Zx \u2265 J(Mx)\u2212 J(Fx), Zx \u2265 0.\nUsing this form of the diamond norm, the primal problem in Eq. (39) follows by summing over the settings x weighted with probabilities p(x) and by explicitly minimizing over the Choi\u2013Jamio\u0142kowskimatrices J(Fx), where Fx is the POVM corresponding to setting x of the free assemblages F .\nTo arrive at the specific SDP for the incompatibility in Eq. (76) from the general formulation in Eq. (39) we first note that the spectral norm \u2016Tr1[Zx]\u2016\u221e of a positive semidefinite matrix Tr1[Zx] can be written as the minimal value ax such that ax1 \u2265 Tr1[Zx] holds. Next, we write out the Choi\u2013Jamio\u0142kowski-matrices corresponding to the channels \u039bMx and \u039bFx in terms of the POVM elements Ma|x and Fa|x. Finally, we constraint the Fa|x explicitly to be JM i.e., that it holds Fa|x = \u2211 \u03bb v(a|x, \u03bb)G\u03bb \u2200 x, a, where {G\u03bb} is the POVM simulating F .\nTo derive the dual formulation in Eq. (77), we formulate the Lagrangian of the primal problem by incorporating the constraints explicitly. The Lagrangian is given by\nL = \u2211 x p(x)ax + \u2211 x Tr[Hx(Tr1[Zx]\u2212 ax1)] (80)\n+ \u2211 x Tr[Cx (\u2211 a |a\u3009\u3008a| \u2297 [Ma|x \u2212 \u2211 \u03bb v(a|x, \u03bb)G\u03bb]T \u2212 Zx ) ] + Tr[L( \u2211 \u03bb G\u03bb \u2212 1)],\nwhere the Hx are d-dimensional positive semidefinite matrices, the Cx are (o \u00d7 d)-dimensional positive semidefinite matrices, where o is the number of measurement outcomes, and L is a ddimensional Hermitian matrix. Note that for every feasible point in Eq. (76), it holds I (Mp) \u2265 L.\nBy using the property Tr[Tr1(Zx)Hx] = Tr[Zx(1\u2297Hx)], we can formally state the dual function G({Hx}, {Cx}, L), which is obtained by taking the infimum of the Lagrangian L over the variables of the primal problem. More precisely,\nG({Hx}, {Cx}, L) = (81)\ninf ax,Zx,G\u03bb\u22650 {\u2211 x ax(p(x)\u2212 Tr[Hx])\u2212 Tr[L] + \u2211 x Tr[Zx(1\u2297Hx \u2212 Cx)]\n+ \u2211 \u03bb Tr[G\u03bb(L\u2212 \u2211 a,x v(a|x, \u03bb)Tr1[(|a\u3009\u3008a| \u2297 1)Cx]T )] + \u2211 x Tr[Cx( \u2211 a |a\u3009\u3008a| \u2297MTa|x)] } .\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-04-22, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 25\nIt is clear that G({Hx}, {Cx}, L) is unbounded from below, unless certain conditions (the dual constraints) are met. For instance, if p(x)\u2212 Tr[Hx] < 0 holds for some x, the corresponding term ax(p(x)\u2212Tr[Hx]) can be made arbitrarily small by increasing ax, which is only constrained to be non-negative. The corresponding dual program is obtained by maximizing the dual function G over the dual variables {Cx}, {Dx}, L under the dual constraints. This leads to the optimal lower bound to the primal problem. We obtain\nDual problem (incompatibility): (82) given : Mp maximize Cx,Hx,L \u2211 x Tr[Cx( \u2211 a |a\u3009\u3008a| \u2297MTa|x)]\u2212 Tr[L]\nsubject to: L \u2265 \u2211 a,x v(a|x, \u03bb)Tr1[(|a\u3009\u3008a| \u2297 1)Cx]T \u2200 \u03bb,\nHx \u2265 0, Cx \u2265 0, p(x) \u2265 Tr[Hx] \u2200 x, 1\u2297Hx \u2212 Cx \u2265 0, \u2200 x, L = L\u2020,\nwhich is formally the dual program to the primal formulation of Eq. (76). However, we can rewrite the program in Eq. (82) in a more useful form.\nFirst, we can get rid of all transposes by using Tr[ABT ] = Tr[ATB], i.e., by swapping the transposition on the optimization variables Cx. Since the transpose CTx is already included in the optimization, we can simply ignore it. Second, we rewrite the first term of the objective function as Tr[Cx( \u2211 a|a\u3009\u3008a| \u2297Ma|x)] = \u2211 a Tr[Ma|x(Tr1[(|a\u3009\u3008a| \u2297 1)Cx])]. This shows that only the blockdiagonal entries of Cx are important. Note that the same observation holds for the constraints Cx is involved in. It is therefore no loss of generalization to assume Cx as block diagonal. We denote Tr1[(|a\u3009\u3008a| \u2297 1)Cx] = C \u2032a|x.\nWith this, we arrive at\nDual problem (incompatibility): (83) given : Mp maximize C\u2032 a|x,Hx,L \u2211 a,x Tr[Ma|xC \u2032a|x]\u2212 Tr[L]\nsubject to: L \u2265 \u2211 a,x v(a|x, \u03bb)C \u2032a|x \u2200 \u03bb,\nHx \u2265 0, p(x) \u2265 Tr[Hx] \u2200 x,Hx \u2265 C \u2032a|x \u2265 0 \u2200 a, x, L = L\u2020.\nNext, we note that it is always possible (without loss of optimality) to chose p(x) = Tr[Hx], since Hx constraints other variables only from above. We rewrite Hx = p(x)\u03c1x, introducing the variables \u03c1x \u2265 0 with Tr[\u03c1x] = 1. Finally, we rewrite C \u2032a|x such that C \u2032a|x = p(x)Ca|x which leads to\nDual problem (incompatibility): (84) given : Mp maximize Ca|x,\u03c1x,L \u2211 a,x p(x)Tr[Ma|xCa|x]\u2212 Tr[L]\nsubject to: L \u2265 \u2211 a,x p(x)v(a|x, \u03bb)Ca|x \u2200 \u03bb,\n0 \u2264 p(x)Ca|x \u2264 p(x)\u03c1x \u2200 a, x, \u03c1x \u2265 0,Tr[\u03c1x] = 1 \u2200 x,\nwhich is equivalent to the SDP (77). Note that by virtue of the first constraint in Eq. (84), it\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-04-22, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 26\nfollows that\nTr[L] = max F\u2208FJM \u2211 a,x p(x)Tr[Fa|xCa|x]. (85)\nThe bound Tr[L] \u2265 max F\u2208FJM\n\u2211 a,x p(x)Tr[Fa|xCa|x] can be seen by multiplying all the inequalities\nL \u2265 \u2211 a,x p(x)v(a|x, \u03bb)Ca|x \u2200 \u03bb with G\u03bb, then summing over all \u03bb and taking the trace. The equality follows from the fact, that a strict inequality would contradict with the maximization of the objective function.\nAs a final step in the proof, we need to show that there is no duality gap between the primal and the dual program. This follows from Slater\u2019s theorem (see e.g. [73]) since it always possible to find a strictly feasible point in either the primal or the dual problem. This can be seen directly for the dual program in Eq. (77), as we can chose all Ca|x to be proportional to the identity and adjust the \u03c1x and L accordingly."

            "text": "Here, we give an example where an optimization over the input distribution p = {p(x)} for the settings x is relevant to optimize the available resources. In particular, we show that for the incompatibility I (Mp) (see Eq. (24)) of a measurement assemblage with only two settings, the optimal incompatibility is not always achieved for a uniform distribution p(1) = p(2) = 12 . The idea is to introduce noise in only one of the measurement settings, here for x = 2. Let us consider an MUB measurement assemblage N containing m = 2 POVMs, constructed in the same way as the assemblages considered in Table 2. From the MUB measurement assemblage N we obtain the measurement assemblageM via\nMa|1 = Na|1 \u2200 a, (86)\nMa|2 = \u00b5Na|2 + (1\u2212 \u00b5)Tr[Na|2] 1\nd \u2200 a,\nwhere \u00b5 \u2208 [0, 1] is a depolarizing noise parameter for the second measurement. In the following, we analyze how to choose the probability distribution p = {p(x)} such that the incompatibility I (Mp) is maximized for the given assemblageM. As mentioned in section 4, the SDP (40) can be rewritten such that it includes a maximization over the input distribution p = {p(x)}. We illustrate our results in Figure 4 for the optimal setting probabilities p(x) of the assemblageM in dimension d with noise parameter \u00b5.\nAs one can see, even for only two measurements, strong biases towards one setting can be necessary in order to maximize the incompatibility I (Mp). We want to remark that except for the noise free case, i.e. \u00b5 = 1, the optimized input distribution leads to a strictly larger incompatibility than with a uniform distribution. Note that in this particular example, the advantage is weak as can be seen in Figure 5. However, an optimization over the distribution p can lead to a strong increase in incompatibility for m \u2265 3, by essentially neglecting weakly incompatibly subsets of measurements. On a qualitative basis, this effect can be explained in terms of the informativeness IF (Mp) (see Eq. (20)). For large noise (e.g. \u00b5 = 0.1) the distribution is strongly biased towards the noise-free, hence more informative measurement."

We identify q(a|x)1 = Fa|x due to the definition of the UI measurements in Eq. (19). Finally, we sum both sides over a and x. The equality follows from the fact that we maximize the objective function.\nLike for the incompatibility, the SDP formulations of the informativeness IF (Mp) allow us to gain additional insight on the informativeness of WMA Mp. In particular, we show in the following that the informativeness IF (Mp) of any set of rank\u22121 projective measurements is given by IF (Mp) = 1\u2212\n1 d for any probability distribution p(x).\nThis follows by choosing Ca|x = Ma|x\nd , \u03c1x =\n\u2211 a Ma|x\nd = 1 d , and `x = p(x) d as feasible solution\nfor the dual problem in Eq.

This leads by direct computation to the upper bound IF (Mp) \u2264 1\u2212 1 d , which equals the lower bound. State discrimination.\u2014Note that in the particular case of rank-1 projective measurements, the informativeness IF (Mp) can be understood as state discrimination game. More precisely, we consider the following task. Given the (known) states {\u03c1a|x} that are distributed with probability p(a|x) = 1 d\ngiven that we chose the setting x with probability p(x). That is, with probability p(a, x) = p(a|x)p(x) we receive the state \u03c1a|x. The goal of the game is now to identify the label a correctly with as high probability as possible, given that we have access to the measurement assemblage M. We compare this to the situation where we do not perform a measurement and simply guess the label a. The term \u2211 a,x p(x)Tr[Ma|xCa|x] = \u2211 a,x 1 d p(x)Tr[Ma|x\u03c1a|x] can be seen as average probability to correctly guess the label a of the states \u03c1a|x that are send out with probability 1 d given that the setting x has been chosen with probability p(x). The value IF (Mp) = 1 \u2212 1 d\ndescribes now the difference of the optimal average probability, achieved with the assemblageMp compared to randomly guessing the label a for each setting x.\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-04-22, click title to verify.

(93)\nNote that this holds true for appropriately chosen assemblages M of MUB measurement assemblages that are also mutually unbiased to the incoherent basis. However, it is actually not necessary that the measurements within the assemblage are MUB themselves. All what is needed is that Eq. (93) holds true for an assemblage M of rank-1 projections. For instance, the CGLMP (see Eq. (37) and Eq. (38)) measurements are also a valid choices. Under the condition in Eq.

            "text": "In the main text, we defined general distances between measurement assemblages in Definition 1. However, so far we only focused on one particular distance. Here, we introduce more examples of distances for measurements and discuss their basic properties.\nWe start by introducing the Schatten p\u2212norm functions Dp(Mp,Np) for p \u2208 [1,\u221e), defined as\nDp(Mp,Np) = \u2211 a,x p(x)12\u2016Ma|x \u2212Na|x\u2016p, (94)\nwhere \u2016X\u2016p = (Tr[|X|p])1/p is the Schatten p\u2212norm of X. Note that the cases p = 1 and p =\u221e correspond to the trace norm, respectively the spectral norm. While the functions Dp(Mp,Np) will generally not fulfil the monotonicity under Hilbert-Schmidt adjoint channels \u039b\u2020 according to Definition 1, we will show in the following that the p =\u221e case corresponds to a proper distance. Note that for p = 1, the monotonicity under quantum channel \u039b\u2020 is not fulfilled, which can be seen by considering trivial extensions of the form \u039b\u2020(Ma|x) = 1 \u2297Ma|x. Nevertheless, we also define the induced functions\nRp(Mp) = min F\u2208F Dp(Mp,Fp) (95)\nWe formulate the following theorem to show that D\u221e(Mp,Np) is a distance between measurement assemblages.\nTheorem 5. The function D\u221e(Mp,Np) is a distance function between the WMAsMp and Np, i.e., it fulfils all the conditions stated in Definition 1. Moreover, D\u221e(Mp,Np) is jointly-convex. Proof. The proof can be split into several parts. Note first, that since D\u221e(Mp,Np) is a weighted sum of spectral norms, it follows that D\u221e(Mp,Np) \u2265 0 with equality holding if and only if M = N . Note further that the symmetry and triangle inequality condition in Definition 1 are fulfilled trivially.\nFor the monotonicity under quantum channel, we consider a more general data-processing type inequality for the\u221e\u2212 distance between two POVM elements. Namely, for \u039b\u2020(Ma|x) and \u039b\u2020(Na|x), where \u039b\u2020 is a unital completely positive map, it follows\n\u2016\u039b\u2020(Ma|x)\u2212 \u039b\u2020(Na|x)\u2016\u221e = max \u03c1 |Tr[(\u039b\u2020(Ma|x)\u2212 \u039b\u2020(Na|x))\u03c1]| (96)\n= max \u03c1 |Tr[(Ma|x \u2212Na|x)\u039b(\u03c1)]| \u2264 max \u03c1\u2032 |Tr[(Ma|x \u2212Na|x)\u03c1\u2032]|\n= \u2016Ma|x \u2212Na|x\u2016\u221e,\nwhere we used the dual representation of the Schatten-\u221e norm and the fact that maximum is always achieved for a density matrix \u03c1 (more specifically the projector onto the eigenvalue of largest absolute value of \u039b\u2020(Ma|x) \u2212 \u039b\u2020(Na|x)). Furthermore, we used that the adjoint of the unital completely positive map \u039b\u2020 is a CPT map \u039b which maps density matrices onto density matrices and therefore shrinks the state-space one optimizes over. Since D\u221e(Mp,Np) is a sum of norms \u2016Ma|x \u2212Na|x\u2016\u221e, it follows that D\u221e(Mp,Np) \u2265 D\u221e(\u039b\u2020(M)p,\u039b\u2020(N )p).\nThe monotonicity under classical simulations \u03be(Mp)q follows by direct computation, D\u221e(\u03be(Mp)q, \u03be(Np)q) = 1 2 \u2211 b,y q(y)\u2016 \u2211 x,a p(x|y)q(b|y, x, a)[Ma|x \u2212Na|x]\u2016\u221e (97)\n\u2264 12 \u2211 b,y q(y) \u2211 x,a p(x|y)q(b|y, x, a)\u2016Ma|x \u2212Na|x\u2016\u221e\n= 12 \u2211 y,x,a q(y)p(x|y)\u2016Ma|x \u2212Na|x\u2016\u221e\n= 12 \u2211 x,a p(x)\u2016Ma|x \u2212Na|x\u2016\u221e = D\u221e(Mp,Np),\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-04-22, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 31\nwhere we used the following properties. In the first line, we used the definition of D\u221e(\u03be(Mp)q, \u03be(Np)q) by introducing the assem-\nblagesM\u2032q = \u03be(Mp)q and N \u2032q = \u03be(Np)q where we inserted M \u2032b|y = \u2211 x p(x|y) \u2211 a q(b|y, x, a)Ma|x\nand N \u2032b|y = \u2211 x p(x|y) \u2211 a q(b|y, x, a)Na|x directly. In the second line, we used the triangle inequality. In the third line, we performed the sum over b. Finally, in the fourth line, we used that \u2211 y q(y)p(x|y) = p(x), which leads exactly to the definition of D\u221e(Mp,Np) from which the monotonicity under classical simulations \u03be follows. Therefore, D\u221e(Mp,Np) is a distance between measurement assemblages according to Definition 1.\nThe proof of the joint-convexity of D\u221e(Mp,Np) follows exactly the same lines as the proof of the joint-convexity of D (Mp,Np) in Theorem 1 and can be adapted from there.\nEven though they are not resource monotones generally, the functions Rp(Mp) in Eq. (95) can be used to bound the resource quantifier R (Mp) defined in Eq. (15). More specifically, we derive in the following the bounds on the diamond distance based quantifier R (Mp) given by\n1 d R\u221e(Mp) \u2264 1 d R1(Mp) \u2264 R (Mp) \u2264 R\u221e(Mp) \u2264 R1(Mp), (98)\nwhere d is the dimension of the Hilbert space H the POVMs from M act on. Note that due to the monotonicity of Schatten norms, it holds \u2016X\u2016p \u2264 \u2016X\u2016p\u2032 for p \u2265 p\u2032 from which the bounds 1 d R\u221e(Mp) \u2264 1 d\nR1(Mp) and R\u221e(Mp) \u2264 R1(Mp) follow directly. The bound R (Mp) \u2264 R\u221e(Mp) follows from\nR (Mp) = min F\u2208F 1 2 \u2211 x p(x) max \u03c1 \u2211 a \u2016Tr1[(Ma|x \u2297 1)\u03c1]\u2212 Tr1[(Fa|x \u2297 1)\u03c1]\u20161 (99)\n\u2264 min F\u2208F 1 2 \u2211 x p(x) max \u03c1 \u2211 a \u2016(Ma|x \u2297 1)\u03c1\u2212 (Fa|x \u2297 1)\u03c1\u20161\n\u2264 min F\u2208F 1 2 \u2211 a,x p(x) max \u03c1 \u2016(Ma|x \u2297 1)\u2212 (Fa|x \u2297 1)\u2016\u221e\u2016\u03c1\u20161\n= min F\u2208F 1 2 \u2211 a,x p(x)\u2016(Ma|x \u2297 1)\u2212 (Fa|x \u2297 1)\u2016\u221e = R\u221e(Mp),\nwhere we used the definition of R (Mp) in the first line and the monotonicity of the trace norm under partial trace in the second line. In the third line, we used the H\u00f6lder inequality and in the last line identified the definition of R\u221e(Mp).\nThe last remaining bound 1 d R1(Mp) \u2264 R (Mp) can directly be obtained by using \u03c1 =\n|\u03a6+\u3009\u3008\u03a6+| within the optimization of the diamond norm. Here, |\u03a6+\u3009 = 1\u221a d\n\u2211d\u22121 i=0 |ii\u3009 is the max-\nimally entangled state, where (as before) d is the dimension the POVMs of the measurement assemblageM act on. It follows\nR (Mp) = min F\u2208F 1 2 \u2211 x p(x) max \u03c1 \u2211 a \u2016Tr1[(Ma|x \u2297 1)\u03c1]\u2212 Tr1[(Fa|x \u2297 1)\u03c1]\u20161 (100)\n\u2265 min F\u2208F 1 2 \u2211 x p(x) \u2211 a \u2016Tr1[(Ma|x \u2297 1)|\u03a6+\u3009\u3008\u03a6+|]\u2212 Tr1[(Fa|x \u2297 1)|\u03a6+\u3009\u3008\u03a6+|]\u20161\n= min F\u2208F 1 2 \u2211 x p(x) \u2211 a 1 d \u2016(Ma|x \u2212 Fa|x)T \u20161\n= min F\u2208F 1 2 \u2211 x p(x) \u2211 a 1 d \u2016Ma|x \u2212 Fa|x\u20161 = 1 d R1(Mp),\nwhere we used in the first line the definition of R (Mp) and in the second line that \u03c1 = |\u03a6+\u3009\u3008\u03a6+| is a feasible point within the maximization over the quantum states within the diamond norm. In the third line, we used that Tr1[(Ma|x \u2297 1)|\u03a6+\u3009\u3008\u03a6+|] = 1 d MTa|x, where the transposition is with\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-04-22, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 32\nrespect to the computational basis. Finally, we can use that a transposition does not change the singular values.\nThe monotone R\u221e(Mp) in particular is not only a valuable tool to bound the diamond distance R (Mp) but is also interesting in itself. More specifically, we show in the following that R\u221e(Mp) obeys also a measurement hierarchy similar to that in Eq. (30). Let IF\u221e(Mp),C\u221e(Mp), and I\u221e(Mp) be the informativeness, coherence, and incompatibility ofMp as measured by the distance R\u221e(Mp) in Eq. (95) with respect to the free sets FUI, FIC, and FJM. It follows directly from FUI \u2282 FIC \u2282 FJM that the hierarchy\nIF\u221e(MpA) \u2265 C\u221e(MpA) \u2265 I\u221e(MpA), (101)\nholds. Moreover, it can be shown that I\u221e(MpA) \u2265 S(~\u03c3pA) (remember that we already showed that S(~\u03c3pA) \u2265 N(qp)). This follows from the direct computation for any quantum state \u03c1 of appropriate dimension and the closest JM assemblage F\u2217 toM (with respect to the monotone I\u221e(Mp)):\nS(~\u03c3pA) \u2264 1 2 \u2211 a,x pA(x)\u2016Tr1[((Ma|x \u2212 F \u2217a|x)\u2297 1)\u03c1]\u20161 (102)\n\u2264 12 \u2211 a,x pA(x)\u2016((Ma|x \u2212 F \u2217a|x)\u2297 1)\u03c1\u20161\n\u2264 12 \u2211 a,x pA(x)\u2016(Ma|x \u2212 F \u2217a|x)\u2297 1\u2016\u221e\u2016\u03c1\u20161\n= 12 \u2211 a,x pA(x)\u2016Ma|x \u2212 F \u2217a|x\u2016\u221e = I\u221e(MpA),\nwhere we first used that JM measurements always lead to unsteerable assemblages. Second, we used that the trace norm is non-increasing under partial traces. Third, we used the H\u00f6lder inequality. It therefore follows, that the hierarchy\nIF\u221e(MpA) \u2265 C\u221e(MpA) \u2265 I\u221e(MpA) \u2265 S(~\u03c3pA) \u2265 N(qp), (103)\nholds. Another distance for measurement assemblages that can be considered is based on the `1- distance between probability distributions. More specifically, the induced `1-distance between two WMAs is given by\nD`1(Mp,Np) = 1 2 \u2211 x p(x) max \u03c1A \u2211 a |Tr[(Ma|x \u2212Na|x)\u03c1A]|, (104)\nwhich is the `1-distance of the probability distributions {Tr[Ma|x\u03c1A]} and {Tr[Na|x\u03c1A]} maximized over all quantum states \u03c1A. With the same methods as for the distances D\u221e(Mp,Np) and D (Mp,Np) it can be shown that D`1(Mp,Np) fulfills all the conditions in Definition 1. Moreover, the joint-convexity of D`1(Mp,Np) follows from\nD`1(\u03b7M(1)p + (1\u2212 \u03b7)M(2)p , \u03b7N (1)p + (1\u2212 \u03b7)N (2)p ) (105) = 12 \u2211 x p(x) max \u03c1A \u2211 a |Tr[\u03b7(M (1)a|x \u2212N (1) a|x) + (1\u2212 \u03b7)(M (2) a|x \u2212N (2) a|x)]|\n\u2264 12 \u2211 x p(x) max \u03c1A \u2211 a \u03b7|Tr[(M (1)a|x \u2212N (1) a|x)\u03c1A]|+ (1\u2212 \u03b7)|Tr[(M (2) a|x \u2212N (2) a|x)\u03c1A]|\n\u2264 12 \u2211 x p(x) max \u03c1 (1) A ,\u03c1 (2) A \u2211 a \u03b7|Tr[(M (1)a|x \u2212N (1) a|x)\u03c1 (1) A ]|+ (1\u2212 \u03b7)|Tr[(M (2) a|x \u2212N (2) a|x)\u03c1 (2) A ]| = \u03b7D`1(M(1)p ,N (1)p ) + (1\u2212 \u03b7) D`1(M(2)p ,N (2)p ),\nwhere we used the homogeneity and the triangle inequality of the absolute value and the fact that the individual maximization over both terms within the sum over a can only increase the value.\nAccepted in Quantum 2023-04-22, click title to verify. Published under CC-BY 4.0. 33\nHence, D`1(Mp,Np) is a jointly-convex distance function which induces the distance-based convex monotone\nR`1(Mp) = minF\u2208F D`1(Mp,Fp). (106)\nNote that while it follows directly that R`1(Mp) will naturally induce a hierarchy between the informativeness, coherence, and the incompatibility of a WMAMp, it is not clear whether there exist steering or nonlocality monotones that are in natural correspondence to it. Note further that in the context of coherence of single POVMs, this kind of statistical measure has also been defined by Baek et al. [25].\nEven though it is not clear whether a complete hierarchy of measurement resources holds, the quantifier R`1(Mp) is important, as it can be seen as limiting case of the quantifier R (Mp) when the maximization is performed only over product states. More formally, it holds\nR (Mp) \u2265 min F\u2208F 1 2 \u2211 x p(x) max \u03c1=\u03c1A\u2297\u03c1B \u2211 a \u2016Tr1[((Ma|x \u2212 Fa|x)\u2297 1)\u03c1]\u20161 (107)\n= min F\u2208F 1 2 \u2211 x p(x) max \u03c1=\u03c1A\u2297\u03c1B \u2211 a \u2016Tr[(Ma|x \u2212 Fa|x)\u03c1A]\u03c1B\u20161\n= min F\u2208F 1 2 \u2211 x p(x) max \u03c1=\u03c1A\u2297\u03c1B \u2211 a |Tr[(Ma|x \u2212 Fa|x)\u03c1A]|\u2016\u03c1B\u20161\n= min F\u2208F 1 2 \u2211 x p(x) max \u03c1A \u2211 a |Tr[(Ma|x \u2212 Fa|x)\u03c1A]|\n= R`1(Mp),\nwhere we used in the first line that we maximize only over the set of product states. In the second line we used the definition of the partial trace and finally, we used that states \u03c1B are normalized in the 1\u2212norm and identified the last line with the definition of the induced `1-distance quantifier R`1(Mp). In Appendix I, we show that the quantifiers R`1(Mp) and R\u221e(Mp) coincide with R (Mp) in the case of dichotomic measurement assemblages."
