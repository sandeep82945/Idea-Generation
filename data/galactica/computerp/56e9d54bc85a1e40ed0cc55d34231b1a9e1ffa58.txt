We studied the tunable control of the non-Markovianity of a bosonic mode due to its coupling to a set of auxiliary qubits, both embedded in a thermal reservoir. Specifically, we considered a single cavity mode coupled to auxiliary qubits described by the Tavis–Cummings model. As a figure of merit, we define the dynamical non-Markovianity as the tendency of a system to return to its initial state, instead of evolving monotonically to its steady state. We studied how this dynamical non-Markovianity can be manipulated in terms of the qubit frequency. We found that the control of the auxiliary systems affects the cavity dynamics as an effective time-dependent decay rate. Finally, we show how this tunable time-dependent decay rate can be tuned to engineer bosonic quantum memristors, involving memory effects that are fundamental for developing neuromorphic quantum technologies. 1. conclusions We have considered a cavity coupled to a set of auxiliary qubits, which induce a controllable dynamical non-Markovianity (DnM). We show that by the dynamical tuning of the energy gap of the auxiliary qubits, we can go from high to low values of DnM. The dynamics induced by the auxiliary qubits can be considered as an effective timedependent and tunable decay rate. We also showed that the induced DnM in the cavity mode follows a power–law dependence with the number of auxiliary qubits, at least for a low number of qubits. Finally, we showed as an application that we can define memristive response in the cavity mode, which can be switched off by controlling the energy gap of the auxiliary qubits. This means that we can control the dynamical response of the cavity by external control of the auxiliary system, obtaining a switchable bosonic quantum memristor. These results provide a general protocol to obtain controllable bosonic quantum memristors, which can be useful in neuromorphic quantum computing. As our proposal only considers a Tavis–Cummings model where qubits are considered with a tunable energy
gap, our work is experimentally feasible in different platforms, such as trapped ions and a superconducting circuit.

so the derivative of expectation photon number is

∑ j=1
g 〈 i ( −σ+a + σa† )〉 − F(t) 〈 P̂ 〉 − Γc 〈 (a†a) 〉 (A4)
The input and output are 〈 Î〉 = −〈P̂〉 (A5)
〈Ô〉 = d〈â † â〉
dt + Γc
〈 (a†a) 〉 − G(t) (A6)
where G(t) = n ∑ j=1 g 〈 i ( −σ+a + σa† )〉 . As G(t) depends on the interaction between the qubits and the cavity, it can be controlled by the external driving over the set of auxiliary qubits. This means that G(t) will be close to zero when the qubits are off-resonance with the cavity, in which case we can neglect this term and write the output as
〈Ô〉 = d〈â † â〉
dt + Γc
〈 (a†a) 〉 (A7)
The relation between input and output is
Ô = F(t) Î (A8)
where F(t) is Ωc((1− sin(cos µct)).
