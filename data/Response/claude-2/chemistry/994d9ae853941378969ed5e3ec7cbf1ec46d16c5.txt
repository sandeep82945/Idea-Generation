 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Further explore the role of GluB13 in driving the hexamer-to-dimer transition by mutagenesis studies. For example, mutate GluB13 to uncharged residues like Gln and assess the impact on insulin oligomerization at different pH values.

2. Investigate the effects of zinc concentration on insulin polymorphism. The paper hypothesizes that higher zinc would favor hexameric states - this could be tested systematically.

3. Solve the structure of the R3T3R3 polymorph to get a complete structural picture of the pH-dependent transitions between T6, T3R3 and dimeric states.

4. Conduct more detailed analyses of the dynamics and flexibility of the different N-terminal chain B conformations using enhanced sampling simulations.

5. Explore the kinetics of the pH-driven transitions between oligomeric states using time-resolved diffraction or spectroscopy techniques.
