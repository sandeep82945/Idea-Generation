    "abstractText": "Anxiety is a future-oriented unpleasant and negative mental state induced by distant and potential threats. It could be subdivided into momentary state anxiety and stable trait anxiety, which play a complex and combined role in our mental and physical health. However, no studies have systematically investigated whether these two different dimensions of anxiety share a common or distinct topological mechanism of human brain network. In this study, we usedmacroscale human brain morphological similarity network and functional connectivity network as well as their spatial and temporal variations to explore the topological properties of state and trait anxiety. Our results showed that state and trait anxiety were both negatively correlated with the coefficient of variation of nodal efficiency in the left frontal eyes field of volume network; state and trait anxiety were both positively correlated with the median and mode of pagerank centrality distribution in the right insula for both static and dynamic functional networks. In summary, our study confirmed that state and trait anxiety shared common human brain network topological mechanisms in the insula and the frontal eyes field, which were involved in preliminary cognitive processing stage of anxiety. Our study also demonstrated that the common brain network topological mechanisms had high spatiotemporal robustness and would enhance our understanding of human brain temporal and spatial organization.",

It could be subdivided into momentary state anxiety and stable\ntrait anxiety, which play a complex and combined role in our mental and physical\nhealth. However, no studies have systematically investigated whether these two different\ndimensions of anxiety share a common or distinct topological mechanism of human brain\nnetwork. In this study, we usedmacroscale human brain morphological similarity network\nand functional connectivity network as well as their spatial and temporal variations to\nexplore the topological properties of state and trait anxiety. Our results showed that state\nand trait anxiety were both negatively correlated with the coefficient of variation of nodal\nefficiency in the left frontal eyes field of volume network; state and trait anxiety were\nboth positively correlated with the median and mode of pagerank centrality distribution\nin the right insula for both static and dynamic functional networks. In summary, our study\nconfirmed that state and trait anxiety shared common human brain network topological\nmechanisms in the insula and the frontal eyes field, which were involved in preliminary\ncognitive processing stage of anxiety. Our study also demonstrated that the common\nbrain network topological mechanisms had high spatiotemporal robustness and would\nenhance our understanding of human brain temporal and spatial organization.\nKeywords: MRI, human brain, anxiety, centrality, efficiency\nINTRODUCTION\nAnxiety is a future-oriented emotional state activated by potential and distant threats (Eysenck et al., 2007; Calhoon and Tye, 2015). It is unpleasant, negative, out of proportion to the threat and can be characterized by aversive and unpleasant avoidance behaviors (Spielberger et al., 1983; Grachev and Apkarian, 2000; Eysenck et al., 2007; Modi et al., 2015). Anxiety is different from fear concerning its association with the anticipation of uncertain threats and can be more easily triggered by distant and unpredictable threats (Geng et al., 2018). Spielberger (1966) suggested that anxiety could be conceptualized into multiple dimensions by distinguishing trait anxiety from state anxiety. Specifically, trait anxiety, as a personality dimension, can be defined as an individual\u2019s predisposition to worry about future threating events (Spielberger et al., 1983), and individuals with high trait anxiety have weakened image processing on the conscious level, stronger induced sensitivity, and a tendency to overprocess relationships (Yin et al., 2016). While state anxiety reflects a temporary, transient, and subjective emotion characterized by physiological arousal and consciously perceived feelings of depression, tension, and apprehension\n(Spielberger et al., 1983; Endler and Kocovski, 2001). There were also some studies considering state anxiety as the state associated with the feeling of anxiety and considering trait anxiety as the frequency of anxiousness (Takagi et al., 2018). State anxiety and trait anxiety were correlated, but independent behavioral measurements that had different influences on attentional and cognitive control processes (Bishop et al., 2007; Crocker et al., 2012; Hur et al., 2015), and distinguishment between them was important for evaluating and monitoring individuals\u2019 levels of anxiety as well as developing effective means to prevent and treat anxiety-related disorders (Forrest et al., 2021). Although state and trait anxiety have independent behavioral definitions, it remained unclear whether they shared common or distinct brain network topological mechanisms.\nIn the neuroscience field, a large number of studies have investigated the neural underpinnings of state and trait anxiety, either common or distinct, using different experimental approaches and techniques. While most studies concluded that they had distinct neuroanatomical and functional substrates (Satpute et al., 2012; Tian et al., 2016; Saviola et al., 2020). In more detail, at the structural level, trait anxiety was associated with gray matter volume in the frontal cortex (Hu and Dolcos, 2017) and the occipital gyrus (Yin et al., 2016), as well as altered cortical thickness in the temporal cortex, the cingulate cortex, and the orbitofrontal cortex (Potvin et al., 2015); at the functional level, trait anxiety was related to regional homogeneity (ReHo) or amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), cingulate cortex (Tian et al., 2016), orbitofrontal cortex (Xue et al., 2018), thalamus, and cerebellum (Yin et al., 2016), as well as functional connectivity (FC) in brain networks, including default mode network (DMN) (Modi et al., 2015; Saviola et al., 2020), ventral attention network (He et al., 2016), and temporo-parietal-frontal network (Modi et al., 2015; He et al., 2016). As for state anxiety, neuroimaging studies concerning structural gray matter volume or thickness are lacking (Saviola et al., 2020) and functional substrates in state anxiety mainly involved limbic regions such as the insula (Tian et al., 2016) and hippocampus (Satpute et al., 2012) in different anxiety provocation tasks. However, there were also several studies showing that there was an interaction and association between state and trait anxiety (Mathews, 1990; Williams et al., 1996). From a systematical perspective, Takagi et al. (2018) found a common brain network among state and trait anxiety in a unified analytical framework. Meanwhile, different experimental approaches revealed that state and trait anxiety were correlated with the same brain regions such as the PFC (Mataix-Cols et al., 2003; Tian et al., 2016), occipital gyrus (Yin et al., 2016; Li et al., 2020), as well as parietal-frontal network (Modi et al., 2015; He et al., 2016; Li et al., 2020). In summary, although previous studies demonstrated that state and trait anxiety shared common or distinct neural substrates, few studies provided a convincing conclusion from multiple spatial and temporal scales, as well as in both brain structure and brain function (Saviola et al., 2020).\nComplex network analysis could be used to explore human brain network topological properties and enhance our comprehension on human brain network architecture and their associations with behaviors (Bullmore and Sporns,\n2009; Sporns, 2011). Brain functional network construction was mainly based on FC (temporal correlation of brain activity) between brain regions (nodes) (Bullmore and Sporns, 2009) using electrophysiological or functional imaging techniques. Previous studies mostly calculated static FC that utilized all the time points (Salvador et al., 2005; He et al., 2016; Saviola et al., 2020). As temporal variability in fMRI signals has already been detected across a typical course of a single scan (Chang and Glover, 2010; Kang et al., 2011; Hutchison et al., 2013a), BOLD signal correlations would definitely show dynamic changes over time scales of seconds to minutes (Chang and Glover, 2010). Also, this dynamical nature of FC reflected a basic property of complex systems such as human brain (Liu and Duyn, 2013; Liao et al., 2015). Therefore, in this study, we would combine static and dynamic FC to construct brain functional network. In contrast, existing methods to construct brain structural network are mainly white matter tractography (Li et al., 2009; Koenis et al., 2018) and structural covariance network (Mechelli et al., 2005; Alexander-Bloch et al., 2013). As stated in our previous study (Li et al., 2021), the white matter tractography could not reliably quantify long-range structural connectivity (Jeurissen et al., 2019) and was largely affected by head motion and might involve a large number of false-positive connections (Thomas et al., 2014; Maier-Hein et al., 2017); the structural covariance network from a large number of participants only yielded one single correlation matrix but did not reveal individual differences (Alexander-Bloch et al., 2013; Li et al., 2021). Therefore, in this study we still used macroscale morphology network that was based on distributions of cortical surface characteristics (cortical volume, thickness, and surface area) from resting-state fMRI (Li et al., 2021) in order to explore the neural substrates of state and trait anxiety. Corresponding to the temporal variations of human brain functional network, we changed bin number of frequency distributions of cortical surface characteristics (area, thickness, and volume) to explore the spatial variations of brain structural network. We expected that topological properties of brain structural and functional networks, as well as their spatial and temporal variations, would efficiently distinguish state anxiety from trait anxiety.\nNetwork topology means the full connection details of a network, that is, human brain connectome (Bullmore and Sporns, 2009; Rubinov and Sporns, 2010). Centrality and efficiency are two commonly used topological measures in human brain network studies. Centrality assesses the importance of a brain region (node) in facilitating functional integration and interaction across the entire network architecture (Rubinov and Sporns, 2010; Zuo et al., 2012). As for efficiency, Latora and Marchiori (2001) demonstrated that network efficiency could be used to measure the information flow within human brain network: global efficiency corresponds to long-distance interactions and reflects information integration over the whole network; nodal efficiency reflects information transfer ability of the parcel (node); whereas local efficiency reflects specialization of a single brain region (node) within the network (Latora and Marchiori, 2001; Rubinov and Sporns, 2010; Bullmore and Sporns, 2012). Global efficiency, nodal efficiency, as well as betweenness centrality, eigenvector centrality, and pagerank\nFrontiers in Neuroinformatics | www.frontiersin.org 2 June 2022 | Volume 16 | Article 859309\ncentrality characterized functional integration across the network architecture, while local efficiency and degree centrality focus on the information flow and transfer in local brain regions and functional segregation (Rubinov and Sporns, 2010). These topological properties have been used to successfully detect the neural basis of various behaviors and diseases (Zuo et al., 2012; Guo et al., 2016; Weiler et al., 2018; Li et al., 2021), did state and trait anxiety share a common or distinct brain network topological mechanism in both functional integration and segregation perspectives?\nTo determine whether state anxiety and trait anxiety shared a common or distinct topological mechanism of human brain structural and functional networks, we recruited 67 healthy participants who finished structural and resting-state fMRI scanning, followed by the assessments of state and trait anxiety. We respectively, used morphological similarity and FC method to construct human brain structural and functional networks and aimed to elucidate the topological mechanisms of state and trait anxiety from both the single-network perspective and their spatial and temporal variations perspective (Allen et al., 2014). Our study confirmed that state and trait anxiety shared common human brain network topological mechanisms in the insula and the frontal eyes field, which were involved in preliminary cognitive processing stage of anxiety. Our study also demonstrated that the common brain network topological mechanisms had high spatiotemporal robustness and would enhance our understanding of human brain temporal and spatial organization."

This was in line with previous studies indicating the activations of the insula in healthy participants\u2019 anxiety provocation tasks (Tian et al., 2016; Geng et al., 2018; Dammann et al., 2020). The insula has been proved to play an important role in subjective emotional processing and internal body awareness (Critchley et al., 2004; Craig, 2009; Singer et al., 2009; Tranel et al., 2009; Ernst et al., 2013), anticipation of future uncertain threat (Geng et al., 2018) and unpleasant negative stimuli (Herwig et al., 2007; Simmons et al., 2011; Lutz et al., 2013), risk and uncertainty in decision-making (Grinband et al., 2006; Clark et al., 2008), as well as visual and auditory awareness (Bushara et al., 2001; Kondo and Kashino, 2007). The positive correlations between topological properties of the insula and anxiety indicated that healthy participants with higher state and trait anxiety might be prone to pay more attention and awareness to internal body feelings and anticipate the risky and uncertain future events or threats due to the activations of the insula. Meanwhile, the role of the insula was also reflected in anxiety disorders, including social anxiety disorder (Duval et al., 2018; Atmaca et al., 2021) and generalized anxiety disorder (Shah et al., 2009; Cui et al., 2020), where they found more interoceptive body awareness, deficits in attentional control and emotion modulation, as well as hyperactive to general emotional images in patients compared to healthy controls. All these studies together demonstrated the connections between the insula and anxiety.\nWhile at the human brain structural level, we found that spatial variations (CV) of nodal efficiency in the left frontal eyes field (FEF) was negatively correlated with state and trait anxiety, which reflected that decreased information transfer ability and efficiency of the FEF contributed to higher state and trait anxiety. The FEF, located in the superior precentral sulcus of the superior frontal sulcus corresponding to Brodmann\u2019s area 6 (Vernet et al., 2014), was not only involved in preparing and triggering various eye movements (Nyffeler et al., 2004; Nagel et al., 2008; Yang and Kapoula, 2011; Jaun-Frutiger et al., 2013), but also important in cognitive processes, including attentional orienting (Muggleton et al., 2003; Grosbras et al., 2005), visual awareness (Smith et al., 2005; Quentin et al., 2013), and perceptual modulation (Thompson et al., 1996). The negative correlations indicated participants with high state and trait anxiety had weakened ability and efficiency of attention control\nas well as perceptual modulation, and might show a tendency to increase more attention to unpleasant threats and stimuli, which was consistent with the attention control theory (Eysenck et al., 2007)."

We found topological properties of the insula and the FEF were both correlated with state and trait anxiety, respectively, at human brain functional and structural level, which suggested that healthy participants who tended to feel anxious in daily life (trait anxiety) might share the same brain network topological patterns during anxious events and threats evocation (state anxiety). Previous studies have demonstrated that there was an interaction and association between state anxiety and trait anxiety (Mathews, 1990; Williams et al., 1996). More importantly, Takagi et al. (2018) have directly demonstrated that trait and state anxiety shared the same brain network and had a substantial biological interrelationship in a unified analytical framework. They hypothesized that participants with high trait anxiety would become increasingly anxious when facing unanticipated anxiety-related events and further enhance their levels of state anxiety. In contrast, participants with low trait anxiety would show a resistant and defensive response to the threats to reduce their levels of state anxiety. In more detail, the insula and the FEF were both involved in preliminary cognitive processing stage awareness (whether external or internal; visual or auditory), which indicated that state and trait anxiety shared the same brain topology mechanisms in alarming and sensing anxiety-related signals. Meanwhile, we also found that spatial variations (CV) of degree centrality in the PFC were only negatively correlated with trait anxiety but not state anxiety. The PFC generally acts as a role in emotion regulation and generation (Dixon et al., 2017), as well as integrates internal and external stimuli, to influence behavioral reactions (Bickart et al., 2012; Lindquist et al., 2012). We inferred that state and trait anxiety might use different human brain network topological mechanisms in the subsequent processes of coping with anxiety-related threats or events.\nTemporospatial Robustness of the Common Topological Mechanisms of Human Brain Networks Between State and Trait Anxiety To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to not only explore the topological properties underlying state and trait anxiety using MRI technique but also verify that the common topological properties of human brain structural and functional networks underlying state and trait anxiety had temporospatial robustness. Human brain is one of the most complicated systems in the world, and it must coordinate complicated information at different spatial and temporal scales. Based on temporal\nFrontiers in Neuroinformatics | www.frontiersin.org 10 June 2022 | Volume 16 | Article 859309\ncorrelations of BOLD time series, functional network could be used to detect human brain functional organization at different temporal scales (Friston, 2011; Allen et al., 2014; Calhoun Vince et al., 2014). Traditional FC method employed correlation coefficient of the time series of the entire scan across brain regions without capturing the temporal variations, while dynamic FC could quantify temporal alterations in FCmetrics across multiple temporal scales (Hutchison et al., 2013b). Dynamic FC was proved to be a sensitive and specific marker of mental illness (Calhoun Vince et al., 2014; Yao et al., 2017). In more detail, previous studies have applied dynamic FC to various diseases such as generalized anxiety disorder (Yao et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2020), schizophrenia (Damaraju et al., 2014; Du et al., 2017), and bipolar disorder (Rashid et al., 2016; Nguyen et al., 2017). All these validated that dynamic FC was useful and efficient in characterizing human brain functional organization at different temporal scales. Corresponding to functional network, we also changed bin number (spatial scales to measure morphological distribution) and gained different morphological similarity resolutions to investigate spatial variations of human brain structural network underlying state and trait anxiety. Previous studies have demonstrated that morphological similarity might be the most accurate and robust method to reflect information transfer between brain regions (Seidlitz et al., 2018; Li et al., 2021), and different spatial resolutions of measuring morphological similarity could detect spatial robustness of human brain structural network underlying state and trait anxiety. This was the first study to examine spatial robustness of human brain networks and characterized the dependence of topological mechanisms of anxiety on spatial resolution. The above temporal and spatial robustness studies would enhance our understanding of temporal and spatial organization of human brain networks. In summary, our study systematically examined the topological mechanisms of state and trait anxiety from both structural and functional networks perspectives, as well as from their spatial and temporal variations perspectives. Our results indicated that state and trait anxiety shared common brain network topology mechanisms, and the common topological mechanisms exhibited high temporospatial robustness.\nIn conclusion, we explored topological properties underlying state and trait anxiety based on human brain structural and functional network, as well as their spatial and temporal variations. We found state and trait anxiety were both positively correlated with pagerank centrality in the right insula, median and mode of pagerank, and degree centrality in the right insula and negatively correlated with CV of nodal efficiency in the left frontal eyes field of volume network.

First, our sample size was small but across a large age span, and we need to increase the number of participants in future studies. Second, our study only analyzed human brain information of cerebral cortex but did not involve subcortical data. Anxiety as a negative emotional state, subcortical information such as amygdala, hippocampus, and caudate should be considered in future explorations. Finally, we only conducted inter-regional correlations and intra-regional vertexwise analysis, and whole-brain vertex-wise analysis required immense memory storage or efficient computational capacity."
