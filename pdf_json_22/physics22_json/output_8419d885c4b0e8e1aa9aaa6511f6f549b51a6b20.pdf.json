Fluorine has just ne stable isotope, 19 F, with many different channels of production epending on the conditions in stars. 19 F is also fragile and can e easily destroyed by \u03b1-captures (e.g. Meynet & Arnould 2000 ). his makes narrowing down a dominant site for fluorine production articularly difficult. There are five main sites that frequently appear n the literature as having the potential to contribute significantly to he chemical evolution of fluorine; these are the following:\n(i) Asymptotic giant br anc h (AGB) stars : Fluorine is produced in GB stars during thermal pulses (Forestini et al. 1992 ; Straniero, allino & Cristallo 2006 ). Secondary 19 F is made from 14 N\need nuclei via the following two chains of reactions: 14 N (n, ) 14 C( \u03b1, \u03b3 ) 18 O (p, \u03b1) 15 N ( \u03b1, \u03b3 ) 19 F and 14 N( \u03b1, \u03b3 ) 18 F( \u03b2+ ) 18 O(p,\nE-mail: k.a.womack-2017@hull.ac.uk\ns 1\n2022 The Author(s) ublished by Oxford University Press on behalf of Royal Astronomical Society\n) 15 N( \u03b1, \u03b3 ) 19 F (Lugaro et al. 2004 ). In certain conditions, primary uorine can also be made in AGB stars from the rapid burning f 13 C at high temperatures, which produces 15 N and allows for he nucleosynthesis of fluorine via 15 N ( \u03b1, \u03b3 ) 19 F (Cristallo et al. 014 ). For a more detailed re vie w of the 19 F production channels n AGB stars, see Lucatello et al. ( 2011 ). Kobayashi, Karakas & meda ( 2011a ) found that the dominant AGB mass range for fluorine roduction is 2\u20134 M , o v er which temperatures do not get hot nough for hot bottom burning to occur, preventing the destruction f fluorine via 19 F ( \u03b1, p) 22 Ne. Ho we ver, it should be noted that the ield set used in Kobayashi et al. ( 2011a ) fa v ours 19 F production n this mass range (see fig. 8 of Karakas & Lattanzio 2007 ). There s observ ational e vidence that AGB stars contribute to the galactic uorine (see the pioneering works of Jorissen, Smith & Lambert 992 ). Ho we ver, it is still unclear whether AGB stars can account for he total galactic abundance of fluorine.\n(ii) Wolf\u2013Rayet (WR) stars : Fluorine can be produced by WR tars during the helium burning phase. Again, the seed nuclei for 9 F production in these stars are 14 N. If the 14 N is of secondary\nM\no m o t v o c o m S i y I a 8 A fl t\ns \u03b3 1 w e\ni 1 i i t t u g a m\np i \u03bd J s o\nt\na m R t a m c t i c K [\nt o T\na W K t b\nf ( fl c t a o t s m T e f s e i [ fi ( f ( o\nh t r f n o m\nfl t i l b fl A D A s\na A 2 T c 2 P f s w\n[ l l\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/518/1/1543/6795947 by U niversity of H ull user on 22 N ovem ber 2022\nrigin, then the behaviour of 19 F is also secondary and is therefore etallicity dependent. It is thought that WR winds can eject some f the fluorine before it is destroyed by \u03b1-captures; this process is he result of a delicate balance between the rate at which mass is lost ia winds and the efficiency of the 19 F ( \u03b1, p) 22 Ne reaction. In one f their models, Meynet & Arnould ( 2000 ) predicted that WR stars an produce as much as 2 \u00d7 10 \u22123 M of 19 F. Ho we ver, since then ther studies have revealed that the 19 F yield in massive star winds ay not be as high as this (e.g. Palacios, Arnould & Meynet 2005 ; tancliffe et al. 2005 ; Brinkman 2022 ). For example, when rotation s accounted for, Palacios et al. ( 2005 ) found that the WR fluorine ield falls significantly with respect to Meynet & Arnould ( 2000 ). nterestingly, Brinkman ( 2022 ) found ne gativ e net yields of 19 F in ll their rotating and non-rotating models, with the exception of an 0 M model with an initial rotational velocity v rot = 150 km s \u22121 . ll this raises the question \u2013 do WR stars contribute to the galactic uorine budget at all, which will be addressed in later sections of his work. (iii) Rotating massive stars : Fluorine can be produced in massive tars in the He conv ectiv e shell via the series of reactions 14 N ( \u03b1, ) 18 F ( \u03b2+ ) 18 O (p, \u03b1) 15 N ( \u03b1, \u03b3 ) 19 F (Goriely, Jorissen & Arnould 989 ; Choplin et al. 2018 ). This chain of reactions becomes enhanced hen rotation is induced, due to the increased abundance of CNO lements that arises as a result of rotation (Limongi & Chieffi 2018 ). (iv) Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) : The \u03bd-process in CCSNe s also a proposed site for fluorine production (Woosley & Haxton 988 ; Kobayashi et al. 2011b ). CCSNe are powered by neutrino heatng mechanisms. These neutrinos can interact with some nuclides, ncluding fluorine. 19 F is produced via the \u03bd-process in CCSNe by he following reaction: 20 Ne ( \u03bd, \u03bd \u2032 p) 19 F. Exactly how much fluorine his process might produce in CCSNe is unclear because there is ncertainty around the flux and energy of the neutrinos. Ho we ver, iven that this production is a primary process, more observations t low metallicity might help us to constrain how much fluorine we ight expect to be produced by this source. (v) Novae : Jose & Hernanz ( 1998 ) showed that fluorine can be roduced by novae. The mechanism for novae to produce fluorine s as follows: 17 O (p, \u03b3 ) 18 F (p, \u03b3 ) 19 Ne ( \u03b2+ ) 19 F. Just as with the -process, fluorine yields from novae are still highly uncertain. ose & Hernanz ( 1998 ) found that fluorine was only significantly ynthesized in their 1 . 35 M models. Therefore, we cannot be sure f their contribution to the galactic fluorine abundance.\nNote that here and throughout this work we define AGB stars in he mass range 1 \u2264 M /M \u2264 8 and massive stars 8 < M /M \u2264 120.\nMany chemical evolution studies have tried to disentangle this web nd figure out which sources of fluorine are dominant in different etallicity ranges. There is not much agreement between authors. enda et al. ( 2004 ) used the WR yields of Meynet & Arnould ( 2000 ) o show that WR stars can dominate fluorine production at solar nd supersolar metallicities, while AGB stars were required in their odels to reproduce the trends at lower metallicities. This is in ontrast to the work of Olive & Vangioni ( 2019 ), who concluded hat AGB stars dominate at high metallicity and that the \u03bd-process n CCSNe is required to reproduce lo w-metallicity observ ations. A ombination of AGB stars and neutrino process was also used by obayashi et al. ( 2011b ) to reproduce the observed behaviour of F/O] in globular cluster and solar neighbourhood stars. Timmes, W oosley & W eaver ( 1995 ) was the first chemical evoluion study to investigate fluorine, and they found that the inclusion f novae can reproduce [F/O] ratios in combination with AGB stars. he need for novae to reproduce [F/O] versus [O/H] ratios was\nNRAS 518, 1543\u20131556 (2023)\nlso found by Spitoni et al. ( 2018 ), who concluded that AGB and R stars dominate galactic fluorine production. We note again that obayashi et al. ( 2011a ) found that the dominant AGB mass range hat contributes to fluorine is 2\u20134 M but this contribution can only e seen at [ Fe/H ] \u22121 . 5 dex . By assuming that massive stars have, on average, increasingly aster initial rotational velocities at low metallicities, Prantzos et al. 2018 ) found that rotating massive stars can dominate the evolution of uorine in the solar neighbourhood up to solar metallicity. A similar onclusion was reached by Grisoni et al. ( 2020 ), who investigated he chemical evolution of fluorine by separately modelling the thick nd thin discs of the Milky Way using the so-called parallel model f Grisoni et al. ( 2017 ). In particular, Grisoni et al. ( 2020 ) concluded hat rotating massive stars can dominate fluorine production up to olar metallicity but a boost in fluorine is also needed at higher etallicities in order to match the behaviour of the observations. hey proposed that this boost could be obtained either by artificially nhancing the AGB yields or by including an additional contribution rom novae in the models. The prescription for rotating massive tars in Grisoni et al. ( 2020 ) follows the assumptions of Romano t al. ( 2019 ) where all stars with [Fe/H] < \u22121 de x are giv en an nitial rotational velocity v rot = 300 km s \u22121 , while all stars with Fe/H] \u2265\u22121 de x hav e v rot = 0 km s \u22121 . Rotating massive stars were rst recognized as important at low metallicity by Chiappini et al. 2006 ) in relation to primary nitrogen production, which is the seed or fluorine production. This arose from the work of Matteucci 1986 ), who recognized the need for another primary component f nitrogen. Fluorine has also recently become an element of interest for igh redshift studies. Franco et al. ( 2021 ) were able to estimate he abundance of fluorine in a gravitationally lensed galaxy at a edshift ( z ) of 4.4, determining that WR stars must be responsible or the observed fluorine abundance enhancement. Though this is ot a Milky Way observation, it can still give us an idea of the rigins of fluorine in the early Universe and thus, presumably, at low etallicity. Aside from the uncertainties in the dominant production site of uorine, we must also contend with difficulty in gathering observaions of fluorine. The majority of fluorine abundance determinations n the literature are obtained from the analysis of ro-vibrational HF ines at 2.3 \u03bcm (Abia et al. 2015 ). This spectral range is contaminated y lots of telluric lines, which prevent the use of many HF lines for uorine abundance determinations. Recently, the first detection of an lF line was obtained in 2 M-type AGB stars (Saberi et al. 2022 ). anilovich et al. ( 2021 ) also detected the AlF line towards an S-type GB star , measuring an abundance of AlF 40 per cent greater than olar. Most fluorine observations for chemical evolution studies are vailable using HF lines as detected in both galactic and extragalactic GB stars (Abia et al. 2011 , 2015 , 2019 ), field stars (Lucatello et al. 011 ; Li et al. 2013 ), and in the Galactic Centre (Guer c \u00b8o et al. 2022 ). here are also a variety observations of fluorine in open and globular lusters (e.g. Cunha et al. 2003 ; Cunha & Smith 2005 ; Smith et al. 005 ; Yong et al. 2008 ; de Lav ern y & Recio-Blanco 2013 ; Nault & ilachowski 2013 ; Maiorca et al. 2014 ). Since this work is mainly ocused on the chemical evolution of fluorine in Milky Way field tars, the previously listed observations in open and globular clusters ill not be included in our analysis. The evolution of fluorine at low metallicity (e.g. Fe/H] \u22121.5 dex) poses a particular challenge because of a arge contamination from telluric lines and blending of the HF ines with CO features (Lucatello et al. 2011 ).

( 2011 ) and two red giants in the Carina dwarf pheroidal (dSph) galaxy from Abia et al. ( 2015 ) among others (e.g. i et al. 2013 ; Mura-Guzm \u0301an et al. 2020 ). Both the stellar sample of ucatello et al. ( 2011 ) and the Carina stars from Abia et al. ( 2015 ) re considered in our work.\nThe structure of the paper is as follows: Section 2 lays out he sample of fluorine abundance measurements that are used in his work for different metallicity ranges, Section 3 introduces the ain hypothesis and working assumptions of our galactic chemical volution (GCE) model and summarizes the different combinations f yields that are included in the model, Section 4 presents the ain chemical evolution trends of interest as predicted by our model o reproduce observational data, and Section 5 explains how these esults can help us to probe the chemical evolution of fluorine. Finally, n Section 6 , we present our conclusions.\nOBSERVATIONS\nhe most recent set of fluorine abundance measurements is those f Ryde et al. ( 2020 ), who observed 66 red giants using the mmersion GRating INfrared Spectrometer and the Phoenix infrared igh-resolution spectrograph at the Gemini South Observatory. The etallicity range of these observations is \u22121.1 < [Fe/H] < 0.4, which xtends the metallicity range of fluorine abundances in the solar eighbourhood that were available previous to this study (e.g.  \u0308onsson et al. 2017 ).\nDue to telluric lines and blending, much of the data we have at low Fe/H] are upper limits rather than absolute measurements. Though ot as conclusive as absolute measurements, upper limits can still tell s about the range of fluorine abundances we might expect and can ive us a preliminary idea of whether our chemical evolution models an reproduce observations at low metallicity. The primary set of uorine observations at low metallicity used in this work consists of sample of 11 metal-poor red giant stars from Lucatello et al. ( 2011 ). he abundances were measured from the analysis of spectra obtained ith the CRyogenic high-resolution InfraRed Echelle Spectrograph n the European Southern Observatory\u2019s Very Large Telescope VLT). Of the 11 stars in the metallicity range \u22123.4 < [Fe/H] < \u22121.3, wo have abundance measurements of fluorine, while the remaining ine have upper limits provided. Eight red giants in the sample of Lucatello et al. ( 2011 ) are lassified as CEMP-s stars (carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars that re also enriched in s-process elements), whereas two stars are lassified as CEMP-no star (not enriched with s-process or r-process lements). There is also one star in this sample classified as carbon ormal. While the physical origin of CEMP-no stars is still unclear nd debated (Aoki et al. 2002 ; Hansen et al. 2016a ; Yoon et al. 2016 ), he s-process and carbon enhancement as measured in the atmosphere f CEMP-s red giants likely results from binary mass transfer from n AGB companion that changed the initial surface abundances (e.g. eers & Christlieb 2005 ; Lucatello et al. 2005 ; Bisterzo et al. 2010 ; ugaro et al. 2012 ; Starkenburg et al. 2014 ; Hampel et al. 2016 ; ansen et al. 2016b ). Therefore, the predictions of our chemical volution models at low [Fe/H] solely provide a baseline for the verage fluorine ab undances at birth in CEMP-s red giants before ass transfer took place. We also include fluorine measurements as btained in two stars of the Carina dSph galaxy by Abia et al. ( 2015 ). hese measurements were obtained from spectra taken using the hoenix infrared high-resolution spectrograph by Abia et al. ( 2011 ) nd reanalysed by using the spectral synthesis code TERBOSPECTRUM\ny Abia et al. ( 2015 ). The formation of Carina occurred with low star ormation efficiencies and a short infall time-scale (e.g. Lanfranchi,\natteucci & Cescutti 2006 ; Vincenzo et al. 2014 ), as did the Milky ay halo. Therefore, observations in Carina dSph have been included n this work in order to further our understanding of how fluorine ight behave at low metallicity in general. However, since these stars re not Milky Way stars we must be careful as they are not directly omparable with the chemical evolution models presented in this ork or the other observations. The chemical evolution of fluorine n Carina will be the subject of future work.\nGALACTI C C H E M I C A L E VO L U T I O N M O D E L\ne have used the chemical evolution code OMEGA + 1 (C \u0302 ot \u0301e et al. 018 ). This is a two-zone model where a central star-forming region s modelled using the code OMEGA 2 (C \u0302 ot \u0301e et al. 2017 ), which imulates the evolution of several physical and chemical properties ithin a cold gas reservoir, surrounded by a non-star-forming hot as reservoir. The latter is considered as the circumgalactic medium CGM) in our model.\nWe can follow both the evolution of the CGM and the internal starorming galaxy. The evolution of the mass of the gas in the CGM M CGM ) is as follows:\n\u02d9 CGM ( t) = M\u0307 CGM , in ( t) + M\u0307 outflow ( t) \u2212 M\u0307 inflow ( t) \u2212 M\u0307 CGM , out ( t) , (1) here M\u0307 CGM , in is the inflow rate from the external intergalactic edium into the CGM, M\u0307 outflow is the mass remo v ed from the central alaxy and added to the CGM via outflow, M\u0307 inflow is the gas that flows nto the galaxy from the CGM, and M\u0307 CGM , out is the outflow rate of as from the CGM into the intergalactic medium. The intergalactic edium represents the space outside the CGM and is defined as a phere with radius equal to the virial radius of the dark matter halo hat hosts the central galaxy. The mass of the CGM tends to increase if he mass of the dark matter halo also increases, as M\u0307 CGM , in can reach igher values due to a larger availability of gas in the environment; onversely, the CGM mass will decrease when the mass of the dark atter halo decreases, as gas can more efficiently leave the CGM, iving rise to higher values of M\u0307 CGM , out . We can also decrease the ass of the gas in the CGM, even if the dark matter mass stays onstant, by allowing the CGM to have large-scale outflows. Details f all of these terms can be found in C \u0302 ot \u0301e et al. ( 2018 ), C \u0302 ot \u0301e et al. 2019 ), and references therein [see fig. 7 of C \u0302 ot \u0301e et al. ( 2018 ) for a isual representation of the workings of OMEGA + ]. The evolution of the galactic gas mass M\u0307 gas is defined as (Tinsley 980 ; Pagel 1997 ; Matteucci 2012 )\n\u02d9 gas ( t) = M\u0307 inflow ( t) + M\u0307 ej ( t) \u2212 M\u0307 ( t) \u2212 M\u0307 outflow ( t) , (2) here M\u0307 inflow is the mass added by galactic inflows from the CGM, \u02d9 ej is the mass added by stellar ejecta, M\u0307 is the mass lock ed aw ay y star formation, and M\u0307 outflow is the mass lost by outflows into the GM. This equation is used at each time-step to track the evolution f the galaxy across 13 Gyr. The infall prescription of gas from the CGM into the galaxy we use ere is a dual-infall model based on Chiappini, Matteucci & Gratton 1997 ). It combines two episodes of exponential gas inflow and is\nMNRAS 518, 1543\u20131556 (2023)\nM\nTable 1.

An SSP is defined as a population of stars with he same age and chemical composition, with the number of each ype of star in the different evolutionary stages being weighted by n initial mass function (IMF). In this work, we adopt the IMF of roupa ( 2001 ). SYGMA includes ejecta from low- and intermediateass stars, massive stars, Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), and neutron tar mergers and additional sources can also be added manually by he user. The ejecta from the SSPs are then instantaneously and niformly mixed into the gas reservoir. SNe Ia are modelled by assuming a power-law delay-time distriution (DTD) similar to that of Maoz & Mannucci ( 2012 , see also reundlich & Maoz 2021 ; Wiseman et al. 2021 ) in the form t \u2212\u03b2 with = 1. The minimum delay time of SNe Ia is set by the lifetime of ntermediate-mass stars used in the GCE calculation.

The temporal evolution f the rate of SNe Ia is normalized such that 10 \u22123 SNe occur per units f solar mass formed (see table 5 in C \u0302 ot \u0301e et al. 2016 , for references). e use the solar abundances of Asplund et al.

We explore the following options for our GB yields: (i) the FUll-Network Repository of Updated Isotopic ables & Yields (FR UITY) for A GB stars from Cristallo et al. ( 2015 ), hich are available for metallicities 10 \u22124 \u2264 Z \u2264 2 \u00d7 10 \u22122 and masses n the range 1.3\u20136 . 0 M ; (ii) the Monash AGB yields from Lugaro t al. ( 2012 ), Karakas & Lugaro ( 2016 ), and Karakas et al. ( 2018 ) ith metallicities 10 \u22124 \u2264 Z \u2264 3 \u00d7 10 \u22122 and masses in the range 0.9\u2013 . 0 M ; (iii) an extended version of the previous Monash yields that o v er the same range of masses and metallicities as the previous set, here heavy elements (anything heavier than iron) are also included Karakas & Lugaro 2016 ; Karakas et al. 2018 ); and finally, (iv) the GB yields from Ventura et al. ( 2013 , 2014 , 2018 ) with metallicities \u00d7 10 \u22124 \u2264 Z \u2264 1.4 \u00d7 10 \u22122 and masses in the range 1.0\u20137 . 5 M . We consider the two following options for our massive star yields:\n(i) Set R of Limongi & Chieffi ( 2018 ), who developed stellar volution models for massive stars by assuming three different initial otation velocities as follows: v rot = 300 km s \u22121 , v rot = 150 km s \u22121 , nd no rotation; all of these options will be explored in this work. or each rotational velocity, Limongi & Chieffi ( 2018 ) developed odels with initial iron abundances [Fe/H] = 0, \u22121, \u22122, and \u22123 dex n the mass range 13\u2013120 M . The chemical evolution models of rantzos et al. ( 2018 ) assume a yield set that combines the massive tar models of Limongi & Chieffi ( 2018 ) with different v rot depending n metallicity, by assuming that lower metallicity stars rotate faster, n average, than higher metallicity stars, as illustrated in fig. 4 of rantzos et al. ( 2018 ). A similar mixture of rotating massive star odels that varies as a function of [Fe/H] will also be explored n this work. The logic for this combination comes about because eynet & Maeder ( 1997 ) stated that in order to conserve angular omentum, low-metallicity stars must rotate faster as they are more ompact.\nFigure 1.

These yields use metallicities 0 \u22123 \u2264 Z \u2264 5 \u00d7 10 \u22122 in the mass range 13\u201340 M . Of these yield sets, we mainly consider the FR UITY A GB yields ecause they cover a large range of masses and metallicities. The ode used to calculate these yields is also coupled to a full nuclear etwork up to the termination point of the s-process; therefore, it onsiders the full range of isotopes and reactions rele v ant to this ork. F or massiv e stars, we mainly use the yields of Limongi & hieffi ( 2018 ) in order to investigate the impact of rotation. Finally, or all models we use the W7 SNIa yields of Iwamoto et al. ( 1999 ). RESULTS ig. 1 (a) shows the abundance trend of [F/Fe] versus [Fe/H] for odels assuming different combinations of yields, as summarized n Table 2 . The predictions of our models are compared with igh metallicity observations of fluorine abundances in the red iant sample of Ryde et al. ( 2020 , red points with error bars) and ow metallicity observations in red giants from Lucatello et al. 2011 , brown square symbols represent stars classified as CEMP, whereas brown crosses are CEMP-no stars; the carbon normal tar is represented by a brown point) and Abia et al. ( 2015 , pink quares with error bars). We remind the readers that our models redict the evolution of the chemical abundances in the interstellar edium (ISM), hence how the birth abundances of stars change with ime throughout the evolution of the Galaxy. The two models that include massive stars with no rotation CLC000 and CNom) show an increasing trend in [F/Fe] at higher etallicities that is in line with observ ations. Ho we ver, these two odels lie below the observed abundances. We note that, in the lowetallicity regime from \u22123.5 < [Fe/H] < \u22122, the observational data re upper limits rather than absolute measurements, along with the igh dispersion of the observational data in this metallicity range, hich prevents us from drawing strong conclusions in this regime. he strongest constraint on our chemical evolution models is proided by observations in the metallicity range \u22120.7 < [Fe/H] < 0.4. e can still draw conclusions in the range \u22122 < [Fe/H] < \u22120.7 but e are limited by poor statistics. All models with rotating massive tars included cut through the middle of the upper limits, with the ajority of the brown points sitting abo v e the chemical evolution rend lines. This is important because we know that an upper limit eans that the value quoted has the potential to be lower than what s measured. We also see that the models including rotating massive tars are consistent with the bulk of the high-metallicity data. We note hat models with higher v rot can reach increasingly higher [F/Fe] atios at high metallicity. None the less, no model with high v rot eproduces the upward trend seen in observations at high [Fe/H], hich is only seen in the models with v rot = 0. Fig. 1 (b) shows the abundance trend of [F/O] versus [O/H] for he same set of models as in Fig. 1 (a). These ratios are commonly lotted together when studying the chemical evolution of fluorine to race the impact of the chemical enrichment from massive stars with inimal connection to the choice of the location of the mass cut in the assive star models. Looking at chemical evolution trends relative o oxygen is also useful because they do not include the uncertainties ssociated with SN Ia models. In Fig. 1 (b), the trajectories are again ompared with observations from Ryde et al. ( 2020 ) and Lucatello t al. ( 2011 ). Again, some observations provide better constraints for ur GCE models than others, with those at [O/H] > \u22120.4 providing he strongest constraint. We can see that all models that include any ort of prescription for rotation in massive stars cut through the low etallicity observations, including VenLCmix. Further discussion of his model can be found later in the section. Of the two models that o not include rotating massive stars (CLC000 and CNom), only LC000 reproduces the abundance trends of the high metallicity bservations. In Figs 1 (a) and (b), we also investigate the impact of different GB stellar yields on the chemical enrichment of fluorine. Our model ith the FRUITY stellar yields for AGB stars (CLCmix) predicts imilar abundance trends as the models with the Monash stellar yields Mon18LCmix and MonLCmix). The model with the AGB stellar ields of Ventura et al. ( 2013 , 2014 , 2018 ) (VenLCmix) predicts igher final fluorine abundances in both Figs 1 (a) and (b) compared o the FRUITY and Monash yields but they still lie within the high etallicity observations.\nMNRAS 518, 1543\u20131556 (2023)\nM\nFigure 2.

( 2013 , 2014 , 2018 ) are xplored in more detail in Fig. 2 , which shows chemical evolution odels combining those yields with massive star models with ifferent initial v rot from Limongi & Chieffi ( 2018 ). Fig. 2 (a) shows ur results for [F/Fe] versus [Fe/H], whereas Fig. 2 (b) focuses on F/O] versus [O/H]. In each figure, the chemical evolution trends for ach massive star prescription are similar in shape to the trends e predict when assuming the FR UITY A GB yields. Ho we ver,\nhe final values for models V enLCmix, V enLC000, V enLC150, and enLC300 for both [F/Fe] and [O/H] are systematically higher than LCmix, CLC000, CLC150, and CLC300. The AGB stellar yields of Ventura et al. ( 2013 , 2014 , 2018 ) were he reference set adopted by Grisoni et al. ( 2020 ) in their \u2018parallel\u2019 hemical evolution model for the solar neighbourhood. However, hen comparing our results with those in fig. 1 of Grisoni et al. 2020 ), we caution the readers that we assume a different IMF and TD for SNe Ia. In particular, Grisoni et al. ( 2020 ) assumed the MF of Kroupa, Tout & Gilmore ( 1993 ), which hosts much lower umbers of massive stars than the IMF of Kroupa ( 2001 ) that we se in our models (see also Vincenzo et al. 2016 , for more details);\nNRAS 518, 1543\u20131556 (2023)\necondly, while Grisoni et al. ( 2020 ) assumed the SN Ia singleegenerate model of Matteucci & Recchi ( 2001 ), here we assume power-law DTD that is moti v ated by recent observational surv e ys see also Wiseman et al. 2021 , for an observational perspective, and incenzo, Matteucci & Spitoni 2017 , for the impact of those two ifferent DTDs on elemental abundance trends; Maoz & Mannucci 012 ). When we consider the [F/Fe] versus [Fe/H] abundance diagram Fig. 2 a), our model with v rot = 0 (VenLC000) predicts [F/Fe] ratios hat are al w ays \u22480.5 dex higher than model Thin-V000 of Grisoni t al. ( 2020 ). Our models with v rot = 150 and 300 km s \u22121 (VenLC150 nd VenLC300, respectively), instead, al w ays lie below models Thin150 and Thin-V300 of Grisoni et al. ( 2020 ) for iron abundances etween \u22121.5 [Fe/H] \u22120.5 but then mo v e abo v e them as etallicity increases. It is difficult to compare models with variable rot because we follow different prescriptions. We recall that Grisoni t al. ( 2020 ) chose the prescription of Romano et al. ( 2019 ) with a harp transition from v rot = 300 to 0 km s \u22121 at [Fe/H] = \u22121 dex, hereas our model uses a prescription from Prantzos et al. ( 2018 ) hat employs a more gradual change to lower rotational velocities as he metallicity increases. The mix of rotational velocities adopted in he present work (VenLCmix) follows the observational trends much\nore closely than Thin-Vvar of Grisoni et al. ( 2020 ). When we consider the [F/O] versus [O/H] abundance diagram Fig. 2 b), our models with v rot = 0 km s \u22121 al w ays lie abo v e model hin-V000 of Grisoni et al. ( 2020 ), being separated by a constant ffset of \u22480.2 dex. Our model VenLC150 appears to sit lower than hin-V150 of Grisoni et al. ( 2020 ) for [ Fe/H ] 0 dex . Interestingly, he models with v rot = 300 km s \u22121 follow a very similar shape in oth this work and Grisoni et al. ( 2020 ). Ho we ver, our model always ies below Thin-V300 of Grisoni et al. ( 2020 ), being separated by an ffset of \u22480.3 dex. Our model with a rotational mix (VenLCmix) can eproduce the observations at high metallicity more closely than the hin-Vvar of Grisoni et al. ( 2020 ). Ho we ver, we remind the reader nce again that each of our w orks emplo ys a different prescription or rotational mixing.\nIn summary, this discussion shows how careful we must be when e make chemical evolution models, and it further highlights the ncertainties we have in trying to best model the Milky Way.\n.1 Fluorine and s-process elements\nhe interplay between fluorine and s-process elements has been reviously commented on in the literature (e.g. Abia et al. 2011 , 015 , 2019 ; Lucatello et al. 2011 ). Fluorine and s-process elements an be made together both in AGB stars and massive stars, especially hen mixing is enhanced by rotation. In massive stars, fluorine nucleosynthesis takes place in the helium onv ectiv e shell via a series of reactions involving \u03b1-captures and roton captures. s-process elements in massive stars are synthesized ia neutron captures, with the neutrons primarily coming from the 2 Ne ( \u03b1, n) 25 Mg reaction. 22 Ne is synthesized from 14 N produced n the conv ectiv e H-burning shell and brought into the He-burning ore. Once in the core, two conv ectiv e \u03b1-captures starting from 14 N roduce 22 Ne. This process continues into the carbon burning phase see Pignatari et al. 2010 ; Prantzos et al. 2018 , for more details). n massive star models without rotation, we might expect to see srocess production up to the so-called first peak, i.e. Sr, Y, and Zr (e.g. imongi & Chieffi 2003 ). However, Frischknecht, Hirschi & Thieleann ( 2012 ) showed that the efficiency of the mixing processes escribed abo v e can be greatly enhanced within rapidly rotating assive stars, leading to s-process production beyond the first peak.\nt \u03b1 m B h o fi p n\nm M A y a I o\nFigure 5. [F/Ba] versus [Fe/H] for models CLCmix, CLC000, CLC150, CLC300, MonLCmix, and MonLC300.

Fluorine is made via a series of neutron, proton, and\ncaptures that use 14 N as the seed nucleus. s-process elements are ade via neutron captures in the intershell region of the star (e.g. usso, Gallino & Wasserburg 1999 ). The primary neutron source ere is the 13 C ( \u03b1, n) 16 O reaction. Given the similar production sites f fluorine and s-process elements, it seems likely that where we nd one we would likely find the other. This means that there is a otential correlation between fluorine and s-process elements that eeds to be explored. Fig. 3 shows the [s/Fe] versus [Fe/H] abundance trend for the odels CLCmix, CLC000, CLC150, CLC300, MonLCmix, and onLC300, which are specified in Table 2 . The models with the GB yields of Ventura et al. ( 2013 ), the first set of Monash AGB ields (Mon. 1), and the massive star yields of Nomoto et al. ( 2013 ) re not shown because they do not include heavy element abundances. n Figs 3 and 4 , \u2018s\u2019 denotes the average s-process abundance for each f the models, where [s/Fe] is defined as follows (Abia et al. 2002 ):\n[s / Fe] = ([Sr/ Fe] + [Y / Fe] + [Zr/ Fe] + [Nb / Fe] + [Ba / Fe] + [La / Fe] + [Ce / Fe] + [Pr/ Fe]) / 8 .\nf we focus on the very low metallicity regime, the only modls that can reproduce the high upper limits on [s/Fe] are those hat include massive stars with v rot = 300 km s \u22121 . In the domain\n2.5 < [Fe/H] < \u22121, the models CLC300 and MonLC300 understimate the observations. These models also sev erely o v erestimate s/Fe] at high metallicity, disagreeing with the observations of Ryde t al. ( 2020 ). We note that a similar mismatch was also seen by Vinenzo et al. ( 2021 ) when comparing their models with the Limongi & hieffi ( 2018 ) rotating massive star yields to the stellar abundance easurements of neutron-capture elements from the second data elease of the GALactic Archaeology with HERMES (GALAH) urv e y (Buder et al. 2018 ). The rest of the models (those with minor or absent contribution from stars with v rot = 300 km s \u22121 ) rovide a better explanation for the high metallicity observations, ith CLCmix and CLC150 reproducing the plateau in the data up to olar metallicity. Fig. 4 shows [F/s] versus [Fe/H] for the same models as Fig. 3 .\ny investigating this ratio, we can continue to probe the chemical volution of fluorine. For comparison, Fig. 5 shows [F/Ba] versus Fe/H] for the same set of models. Since there is minimal change n the trajectory of the chemical evolution trends between [F/s] in ig. 4 and [F/Ba] in Fig. 5 , we can safely use the average s-process bundances for comparison with stellar observations by including a ariety of s-process elements without loss of important information rom tracking elements individually.\nIn the low-metallicity regime ( \u22123.4 < [Fe/H] < \u22122.3), the abunance of F and s-process elements for the CEMP stars in the figure has ikely arisen due to accretion of material from an AGB companion e.g. Busso et al. 2001 ; Sneden, Cowan & Gallino 2008 ; Lucatello t al. 2011 ; Mura-Guzm \u0301an et al. 2020 ). Coupled with the fact that ost of the observations in this region are upper limits, we cannot use hese observations to constrain the GCE models. That being said, it s noteworthy that two scenarios seem to provide similar predictions or [F/s] in Fig. 4 : (i) AGB + massive stars with v rot = 0 (CLC000), nd (ii) AGB + massive stars with v rot = 300 km s \u22121 (CLC300 and onLC300). These two scenarios are potentially very different. For tars rotating as quickly as 300 km s \u22121 , the fluorine present on the urf ace will lik ely have been transported from the interior layers on to he surface due to the strong mixing from rotation. Ho we ver, internal\nixing is not as strong for non-rotating massive stars, so there may ot be as much fluorine transported from the interior layers to the\nMNRAS 518, 1543\u20131556 (2023)\nM\nFigure 6.

This could mean that some of the surface fluorine is present ue to accretion from a companion. There are tw o k ey details in the figures presented in this work that an separate the two potentially different scenarios mentioned abo v e. (i) In Fig. 4 , the solar and supersolar metallicity observations from yde et al. ( 2020 ) show an upturn in their [F/s] that is only predicted y the models with v rot = 300 km s \u22121 . (ii) In Fig. 1 (a), model CLC000 is below all the observations, hich means that solely including non-rotating massive stars is not nough to reproduce the observed fluorine abundance pattern. Overall, this suggests that we need a contribution from rotating assive stars throughout the evolution of the Galaxy in order to eproduce the observations; in particular, Fig. 4 shows that massive tars with v rot = 300 km s \u22121 might play a crucial role in the chemical volution of fluorine, especially when considering the simultaneous roduction of s-process elements. Figs 6 and 7 disentangle the contributions from massive stars,\nGB stars, and Type Ia SNe to 19 F, 56 Fe, 16 O, and 140 Ce as predicted y the model with v rot = 300 km s \u22121 (CLC300). Here, cerium is used s a proxy for the s-process elements. We can see that the massive tar model with v rot = 300 km s \u22121 dominates both 19 F and 140 Ce even hen AGB stars kick in between \u22121 < [Fe/H] < 0. Fig. 7 highlights his range in more detail. By looking at the predictions of model CLC300 in Figs 6 and 7 , oth 19 F and 140 Ce abundances at [Fe/H] = 0 are higher than solar by a actor of \u22484 and \u22486, respectively (the black dashed line on each panel orresponds to the solar fluorine and cerium abundances). Therefore, ven though models CLC300 and MonLC300 are best at reproducing he observational trends of Fig. 4 , the fluorine and average s-process bundances that they generate at solar metallicity are not physical,\nNRAS 518, 1543\u20131556 (2023)\nuggesting that a mix of massive star models with different v rot should e assumed. The mix of rotational velocity we might expect will be iscussed in the following section.\nDI SCUSSI ON\nt low metallicity, most red giants in the sample of Lucatello et al. 2011 ) are classified as CEMP-s; hence, they likely had their surface uorine abundances altered by binary mass transfer from an AGB ompanion. In Figs 1 (a)\u20135 , we also show CEMP-no stars, whose rigin in the Milky Way halo is less clear. Our model predictions t low metallicity can solely be used as a baseline for the average SM abundances at the point of birth of the stars, before any binary ccretion has occurred, providing an empirical constraint on the egree of fluorine enhancement for AGB stellar models. There is lso a larger spread in the observed chemical abundance patterns t [Fe/H] < \u22122.5, which indicates a more inhomogeneous ISM at ow metallicity, as stars formed out of gas enriched by a smaller umber of CCSNe, whereas our models assume that the ISM is well ixed at all times, with the IMF being fully sampled starting from he turn-off mass. An additional source of scatter in the chemical bundances at [Fe/H] < \u22122.5, which is not included in our models, ight be due to the fact that the Milky Way halo comprises several opulations of stars that were born in different substructures and were ater accreted by our Galaxy. We also note again that the observations n the metallicity range \u22123.4 < [Fe/H] < \u22122.3 are upper limits with lot of dispersion. All this leads to uncertainty in our conclusions at Fe/H] < \u22122.\nAt supersolar metallicity, there is a secondary behaviour of fluorine Ryde et al. 2020 ). Ho we ver, we must be careful about comparing our odels to observations at this metallicity for a number of reasons.\nFigure 7.

Secondly, stars with supersolar metallicity re known to have formed in the inner disc and migrated, so their omposition is different to that of the local gas (see fig. 10 of incenzo & Kobayashi 2020 , for an illustration of this). Therefore, he abundances of supersolar metallicity stars cannot be compared ith a one-zone model. Though we do not make strong conclusions bout the evolution of fluorine abo v e [Fe/H] = 0, these considerations hould be kept in mind. The models using massive stars with initial rotational velocities of 00 km s \u22121 are the only ones to reproduce both the slight downward rend of [F/s] at low metallicity and upward trend of [F/s] at igh metallicities. Therefore, we need a contribution from rapidly otating massive stars with initial rotational velocities of 300 km s \u22121 hroughout the evolution of the Galaxy in order to match the full bundance pattern. Though models CLC300 and MonLC300 do not atch the full abundance trend of the observations in the [F/Fe] ersus [Fe/H] space (Fig. 1 a), there are many considerations to be ade including the fact that the low metallicity observations are pper limits, so there is a chance that those observations could sit ower than where they are placed, and we expect fewer massive tars rotating that quickly at higher metallicities (see Meynet & aeder 1997 ; Prantzos et al. 2018 ). Therefore, we should explore the ossibility of a mix of initial rotational velocities, where stars with rot in the range 150\u2013300 km s \u22121 contribute throughout the evolution f the Galaxy. Romano et al. ( 2019 ) assumed a sharp transition for assive star rotation where massive stars have v rot = 300 km s \u22121 for Fe/H] < \u22121 and, suddenly, v rot = 0 for [Fe/H] \u2265 \u22121. This strategy is ot appropriate for the situation we have here, as a contribution from odels with v rot in the range 150\u2013300 km s \u22121 needs to be assumed v en abo v e [Fe/H] = \u22121. Given we know that at higher metallicities assive stars should rotate more slowly, perhaps a combination of otational velocities is present at higher metallicities, much like the pproach employed by Prantzos et al. ( 2018 ). The mixed-rotation scenario of Prantzos et al. ( 2018 ) asumes that rotating massive stars with v rot = 300 km s \u22121 cease o contribute to the yields at around [Fe/H] \u2248 \u22122, failing to eproduce the observed trend of [F/s] as a function of [Fe/H] see model CLCmix in Fig. 4 ). Therefore, a different combiation of rotating massive star models needs to be employed, y including a metallicity-dependent contribution from models ith v rot = 150 and 300 km s \u22121 up to solar metallicity. Fig. 8 hows the contributions of each rotational velocity to the isotopes 9 F, 56 Fe, 16 O, and 140 Ce relative to solar for models CLC000, LC150, and CLC300 at [Fe/H] = 0. Model CLC000 predicts ( 19 F)/ X ( 19 F) = 0.2 and X ( 140 Ce)/ X ( 140 Ce) = 1.5 , model CLC150 redicts X ( 19 F)/ X ( 19 F) = 1.4 and X ( 140 Ce)/ X ( 140 Ce) = 1.2, nd model CLC300 predicts X ( 19 F)/ X ( 19 F) = 3.7 and ( 140 Ce)/ X ( 140 Ce) = 5.8, at [Fe/H] = 0. In order to reproduce the uorine solar abundance, we need to achieve X ( 19 F)/ X ( 19 F) = .0. This can be done with a 45 per cent contribution from rot = 0 km s \u22121 , a 50 per cent contribution from v rot = 150 km s \u22121 ,\nMNRAS 518, 1543\u20131556 (2023)\nM\nFigure 8.

When employng these contributions, we achieve [F/Fe] = 0.08, [F/O] = \u22120.033, nd [F/s] = \u22120.45. These percentage contributions are our suggestion or a mix of rotational velocities that are successful at reproducing uorine abundances at solar metallicity. It is difficult to make a uggestion for combinations at other metallicities as we do not have constraint for the abundances. We must be careful when suggesting combination of rotational velocities as there are uncertainties n the yields that we must be aware of. First, a change in the mplementation of rotation may change the yields of elements ffected by rotation. As discussed by Prantzos et al. ( 2018 ), another ncertainty associated with the Limongi & Chieffi ( 2018 ) yields in articular is the enhancement of fluorine in the 15 and 20 M models ith v rot = 150 km s \u22121 . In these models, a smaller He conv ectiv e hell forms separately to the main He conv ectiv e shell. When these wo shells merge, the base of the new shell is deeper and thus, is xposed to higher temperatures, which causes an enhancement in uorine production. It is pointed out by Prantzos et al. ( 2018 ) that\nt is difficult to know whether this scenario is \u2018realistic\u2019 given it nly affects two of the stellar models. Other uncertainties such as eaction rates and nuclear networks will be discussed later in this ork. It has been proposed that a contribution from novae is needed n order to match the observed behaviour of [F/O] versus [O/H] e.g. Timmes et al. 1995 ; Spitoni et al. 2018 ). The majority of the odels in this work (CLCmix, CLC150, CLC300, Mon18LCmix, nd MonLCmix) can reproduce the trends of [F/O] versus [O/H] ithout including any chemical enrichment of fluorine from novae see Fig. 1 b). Therefore, it could be argued that we no longer need\nNRAS 518, 1543\u20131556 (2023)\ncontribution from novae to understand the chemical evolution of\nuorine. That being said, it is important to understand the fluorine ields we might expect from novae and the consequences that could ave on our results. It is unclear from the literature both how frequent he occurrence of novae is and the fluorine yields we might get from hem. Kawash et al. ( 2021 ) suggest a nova rate of \u224830 yr \u22121 , while hafter ( 2017 ) suggests a nova rate of \u224850 yr \u22121 and recent results rom Rector et al. ( 2022 ) suggest a rate of \u224840 yr \u22121 ; ho we ver, this esult is for M31 rather than the Milky Way. Both Spitoni et al. 2018 ) and Grisoni et al. ( 2020 ) used the nova yields as predicted by ose & Hernanz ( 1998 ), who found that fluorine is only significantly ynthesized in their 1 . 35 M model, with a maximum yield of 5 . 4 \u00d7 0 \u22125 M and a minimum yield of 9 . 9 \u00d7 10 \u22127 M . This gives a range f potential 19 F nova production rate that varies between 2 . 97 \u00d7 10 \u22125 nd 2 . 7 \u00d7 10 \u22123 M yr \u22121 . The upper bound here is so high due to the ignificant yield from the 1 . 35 M model. This wide range makes he contribution of novae to the galactic fluorine very uncertain. o we ver, we can compare the potential nova yields to the yields e might expect from CCSNe. The CCSN rate is variable with ime in our model with an average rate of 0 . 025 yr \u22121 . The minimum 9 F yield from the Limongi & Chieffi ( 2018 ) massive star yields ith v rot = 300 km s \u22121 is 1 . 027 \u00d7 10 \u22125 M and the maximum is . 025 \u00d7 10 \u22123 M . This yields a potential range of 19 F production ate from CCSNe between 2 . 57 \u00d7 10 \u22127 and 2 . 56 \u00d7 10 \u22125 M yr \u22121 . his range is lower than that of the potential nov a yields. Ho we ver, e must be aware that only the 1 . 35 M nova model is enhanced n fluorine, so there is the potential for the range of fluorine yield rom novae to be lowered given that the enhancement only occurs t this one particular mass. Starrfield et al. ( 2020 ) looked at 19 F jecta from novae for a 1.35 M star and found a range of 6.3 \u00d7 0 \u221211 to 1.0 \u00d7 10 \u22126 M , again demonstrating how uncertain fluorine\ny i u t t\n5\nW e d A p a\ns W f m c c d c e s t c l a m T a\nv c e A H g n\nFigure 10.

Overall, we recognize that novae may ndeed contribute to the galactic fluorine, though the yields are highly ncertain and several critical assumptions need to be made to include hem in chemical e volution models; ho we v er, the y are not required o reproduce the observational abundance patterns in this work. .1 WR stars as a significant source of fluorine? hen massive stars rotate, they can, even if only for a brief period, nter into a WR phase. Given that WR winds have been suggested as a ominant contributor to the chemical evolution of fluorine (Meynet & rnould 2000 ; Renda et al. 2004 ), it is important to disentangle what ortion of the rotating massive star yields comes from WR winds nd what portion comes from the CCSN at the end of their evolution. Meynet & Arnould ( 2000 ) found that WR stars could contribute ignificantly to the galactic fluorine content by calculating a series of R yields and incorporating them into a chemical evolution model or the Milky Way. They found that the 19 F wind yield of a 60 M odel could be a factor of 10\u201370 times higher than the initial stellar\nontent of 19 F. These fluorine yields were subsequently used in the hemical evolution study of Renda et al. ( 2004 ), who explored three ifferent scenarios for the nucleosynthesis of fluorine by using the hemical evolution code GETOOL (Fenner & Gibson 2003 ; Gibson t al. 2003 ). The first scenario explored by Renda et al. ( 2004 ) used olely yields from CCSNe, the second CCSNe and WR stars, and he third used CCSNe, WR, and AGB stars. Renda et al. ( 2004 ) oncluded that, while AGB stars dominate fluorine production at ow metallicity, WR stars are the dominant source of fluorine at solar nd supersolar metallicities (see their fig. 4). In the years since, many ore massive star models have been created that include WR yields. his begs the question, do any of these studies find 19 F yields as high s those found by Meynet & Arnould ( 2000 )?\nFig. 9 shows a comparison of massive star wind yields from a ariety of studies o v er the last couple of decades. The yields that are ompared in the figure are from Limongi & Chieffi ( 2018 ), Ritter t al. ( 2018b ), Brinkman et al. ( 2021 ), Brinkman ( 2022 ), Meynet & rnould ( 2000 ), Ekstr \u0308om et al. ( 2012 ), and Sukhbold et al. ( 2016 ). ere, we look at non-rotating stars at solar metallicity in order to ain the widest comparison and to be able to compare with the on-rotating yields of Meynet & Arnould ( 2000 ). We can see that\nll considered wind yields sit at least 1 dex below the Meynet & rnould ( 2000 ) yields. This suggests that perhaps the Meynet & rnould ( 2000 ) 19 F wind yields are unusually high compared to ubsequent models. Therefore, there is potential that we may be able o rule out WR stars as a dominant contributor to the galactic fluorine udget.\nTo investigate this further, Fig. 10 shows the IMF-weighted yield ersus metallicity for the Limongi & Chieffi ( 2018 ) massive star ields used in this work. Here, we see a comparison between the ind yield and the total ejecta for each rotational velocity. At low etallicity, the wind yields sit 4\u20136 dex lower than the total ejecta or the rotating models and around 2 dex lower for the non-rotating odel. At higher metallicities, the gap between wind contribution and otal ejecta reduces due to enhanced mass-loss, with the wind yields eing around 2 dex lower than the total ejecta for the model rotating t 300 km s \u22121 and 1 dex lower for the model rotating at 150 km s \u22121 . or the non-rotating model, the yields are almost identical at high etallicity. We conclude that we need a large contribution from rapidly otating massive stars in order to reproduce observations of flurine in the Milky Way across the whole metallicity range. For rot = 300 km s \u22121 , wind yields contribute a factor of around 10 \u22122 ess fluorine at high metallicities ([Fe/H] \u2265 0) and a factor of around 0 \u22126 less fluorine at the lowest metallicity ([Fe/H] = \u22123) than the xplosiv e yield, and for v rot = 150 km s \u22121 wind yields contribute a actor of around 10 \u22121 less fluorine at high metallicities and a factor of round 10 \u22126 less fluorine at the lowest metallicity. We can therefore ule out WR stars as a dominant source of fluorine. Being able to raw such conclusions is vital in untangling the web of possibilities or the origin and chemical evolution of fluorine.\n.2 Sources of uncertainty in GCE\nike for any physical model, it is important to consider that there can e significant uncertainties concerning GCE studies (e.g. Romano t al. 2005 , 2010 ). F or e xample, each choice for the parameters in able 1 can affect the behaviour of the chemical evolution models.  \u0302 ot \u0301e et al. ( 2016 ) explored some sources of GCE uncertainty, ncluding the IMF, DTD and number of SNe Ia, current stellar mass, nd star formation history.\nMNRAS 518, 1543\u20131556 (2023)\nM\ns\nd t a [ a ( t\nq l t\ns u d t o l y\nt 1\nZ d t e f r p m v r J T t h w t\ne s e 1\nc fl t a m s s a W t s\nt m e fl t\n6\nW W d d d c\np b f m r a G t c a\nw m ( w\nfl c u h fl\nfl p c t\nm t\nt d A s o\nA\nW o E ( t F 2\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/518/1/1543/6795947 by U niversity of H ull user on 22 N ovem ber 2022\nWe briefly explored the effect of changing both the IMF and the fe of the models on our results. We found that\n(i) using a Kroupa et al. ( 1993 ) IMF rather than Kroupa ( 2001 ) oes not drastically change the results of the chemical evolution rends. Using the Kroupa et al. ( 1993 ) IMF produces more fluorine t lower metallicities, which can produce a slightly better fit for F/Fe] versus [Fe/H] trends but pro vides an o v erproduction of [F/O] s a function of [O/H] for the models that use the Limongi & Chieffi 2018 ) yields. Ho we ver, a better fit to the observ ations is achie ved by he model including the massive star yields of Nomoto et al. ( 2013 ).\n(ii) using a higher sfe naturally exhausts the available gas more uickly, and thus does not produce as much fluorine at higher metalicities, whereas a lower sfe sees a late increase in [F/Fe]. Ho we ver, he shape of the chemical evolution trend is not significantly affected.\nAnother major source of uncertainty in GCE studies is the yield ets used (see e.g. Gibson 1997 ; Moll \u0301a et al. 2015 ). Each author will se a different code for stellar modelling, which will in turn use a ifferent reaction network. A reaction network specifies the reactions hat will occur in a model and the rates at which such reactions will ccur. Different modelling choices made by each author produce a ayered effect when it comes to the uncertainty provided by stellar ields in chemical evolution modelling. To better understand reaction rate uncertainties in the context of his work, we will look at the two reactions that can destroy fluorine: 9 F ( \u03b1, p) 22 Ne and 19 F (p, \u03b1) 16 O.\n(i) The most recent work on 19 F (p, \u03b1) 16 O was performed by hang et al. ( 2021b ). By reanalysing experimental data, they found rastically different 19 F (p, \u03b1) 16 O rates than those recommended by he Nuclear Astrophysics Compilation of Reaction Rate (Angulo t al. 1999 ). They found rates larger by factors of 36.4, 2.3, and 1.7 or temperatures 0.01, 0.05, and 0.1 GK, respectively. This increased ate naturally leads to the destruction of 19 F on a scale larger than reviously thought. By performing a network calculation at solar etallicity with their recommended new rate for the reaction, the alue of 19 F decreased by up to one order of magnitude. This eaction was directly measured by Zhang et al. ( 2021a ) using the inping Underground Nuclear Astrophysics experimental facility. hough the rate they found was 0.2\u20131.3 times lower than that of heir theoretical prediction (Zhang et al. 2021b ), it is still significantly igher than the accepted rate of Spyrou et al. ( 2000 ). Therefore, we ill still expect a larger depletion of fluorine at solar metallicity using his reaction rate. (ii) The most recent work to study 19 F ( \u03b1, p) 22 Ne is Palmerini t al. ( 2019 ), who focused on the role that this reaction takes in AGB tars in particular. They found that during thermal pulses, 19 F can be asily destroyed by \u03b1-captures; in particular, for a 5 M AGB star 9 F can be destroyed by a factor of 4.\nThese new disco v eries related to the reactions that destroy fluorine ould have implications for this work. If indeed, the destruction of uorine is more enhanced in AGB stars than previously thought, he chemical evolution of fluorine at higher metallicities could be ffected. The point at which AGB stars begin to be significant is odel dependent. For model CLC300, Fig. 6 shows us that AGB tars begin to be significant in the production of fluorine around olar metallicity. Therefore, we might expect that the [F/Fe], [F/O], nd [F/s] ratios studied in this work decrease from [Fe/H] = 0.\nhether these reaction rates will also have a significant impact in he destruction of fluorine in rotating massive stars remains to be een.\nNRAS 518, 1543\u20131556 (2023)\nUncertainties around reaction rates are a large source of uncerainty in stellar modelling and the yields we retrieve from those\nodels. All this must be kept in mind when studying GCE. Given specially how uncertain each source\u2019s contribution to the galactic uorine is, uncertainties around reaction rates add another piece to his complex puzzle.\nC O N C L U S I O N S\ne have studied the chemical evolution of fluorine in the Milky ay. W e have used a range of yield sets to try to understand the ominant contributor to the galactic fluorine budget. In order to o this, we compared our chemical evolution models to abundance eterminations across a wide range of metallicities. The main onclusions of this work are as follows:\n(i) We investigated many combinations of yields with different rescriptions for the rotation of massive stars. Though we are limited y upper limits and poor statistics in the low-metallicity regime, we ound that in order to reproduce fluorine abundances across the whole etallicity range ( \u22123.4 < [Fe/H] < 0.4), we need a contribution from apidly rotating massive stars with initial rotational velocities as high s 300 km s \u22121 . We agree with the results of Prantzos et al. ( 2018 ) and risoni et al. ( 2020 ) that rotating massive stars play a crucial role in he fluorine production up to solar metallicities. We also suggest a ombination of initial rotational velocities that can reproduce solar bundances.\n(ii) We have investigated the contribution of massive star and WR inds to the galactic fluorine budget. We compared the winds of ore recent massive star models to the winds of Meynet & Arnould 2000 ) and found that we expect to see significantly less fluorine in ind yields than we did 20 yr ago. (iii) From the initial study of wind yields, we then looked at the uorine yields from the winds of the massive stars used in our hemical evolution models. We found that the wind yield can be p to six times lower than the ejecta from the core collapse. Thus, we ave ruled out WR winds as a dominant contributor to the galactic uorine. (iv) We can rule out novae as an important source of galactic uorine. Our models can successfully reproduce the observational attern in [F/O] versus [O/H] space and as thus we do not need a ontribution from novae that others required in order to reproduce he pattern.\n(v) These conclusions, especially those related to the lowetallicity regime, could be made stronger by additional observa-\nions of fluorine at low metallicity.\nTo conclude, our study into the chemical evolution of fluorine in he Milky Way has found that rapidly rotating massive stars are the ominant contributor to fluorine. We still need a contribution from GB stars from [Fe/H] \u2248 \u22121. We have now been able to rule out WR tars and novae as a significant contributor to the chemical evolution f fluorine.\nC K N OW L E D G E M E N T S\ne thank the re vie wer for their comments that impro v ed the quality f this work.
