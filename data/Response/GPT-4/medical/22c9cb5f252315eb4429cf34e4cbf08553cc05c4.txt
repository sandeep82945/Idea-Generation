Exploring Genetic Correlations Between Activity Traits and Reproductive Performance: Given the moderate heritability of both gestation length and the activity traits recorded by the NUtrack system, a future research idea could involve exploring the genetic correlations between these activity traits and reproductive performance metrics. This could include conducting genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify specific genetic markers associated with desirable activity and reproductive traits, aiming to enhance selection criteria for breeding programs.

Longitudinal Studies on Activity Patterns and Lifetime Productivity: Conducting longitudinal studies to track the activity patterns of sows throughout their entire productive lifespan could provide insights into how early-life behavior predicts long-term reproductive success and longevity in the herd. This research could extend the findings of the initial study by correlating early-life activity traits with additional reproductive cycles beyond parity one, assessing the stability of these traits over time, and their impact on overall lifetime productivity and health of the sow.

Behavioral Interventions and Management Practices: Investigating the impact of environmental and management interventions on modifying gilt behavior in ways that positively affect reproductive traits could be a valuable area of research. This could involve experimenting with different housing conditions, enrichment strategies, or dietary adjustments to encourage behaviors linked to improved gestation length, number born alive, and number weaned. The effectiveness of these interventions could be measured using the NUtrack system to monitor changes in activity patterns.

Comparative Studies Across Different Breeds and Production Systems: Conducting comparative studies to explore how breed differences and production systems influence the relationship between early-life activity traits and reproductive performance could yield actionable insights for a broader range of swine production contexts. This research could help to determine if the observed correlations are consistent across diverse genetic backgrounds and housing conditions, potentially leading to breed-specific or system-specific recommendations for gilt selection.

Integration of Activity Traits into Breeding and Selection Indexes: Developing and testing comprehensive breeding and selection indexes that include activity traits alongside traditional reproductive and production traits could optimize genetic improvement strategies. This research would involve statistical modeling to weight activity traits appropriately within selection indexes, based on their predictive value for reproductive performance and their genetic correlations with other important traits. By integrating these novel traits into selection decisions, producers could potentially enhance the overall efficiency and sustainability of swine production systems.
